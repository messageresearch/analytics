[18:33] man this time i'll ask brother collie if
[18:35] he'll come when the responsibility will
[18:37] all stand
[18:48] man good morning good morning
[18:52] we're gonna read this morning from uh
[18:55] first john both chapter
[18:59] no
[19:00] i think you know both chapters
[19:02] i was thinking
[19:04] this morning driving up
[19:07] out the town we're asking god for things
[19:09] that he's speaking loudly telling us
[19:11] what to do but we keep hearing we keep
[19:13] going a different direction never what
[19:16] did he tell us to go
[19:17] now time i thought this for a couple
[19:19] weeks i was trying to
[19:21] listen to a certain message brother
[19:23] brown
[19:24] preached
[19:25] but every time i put the recorder on
[19:28] i ended up on this different message
[19:30] so finally i stopped and listened to the
[19:32] one i kept it in lebanon
[19:34] and had lots of great things in there
[19:36] that god had on divine healing you know
[19:38] that
[19:39] we're trying to see
[19:41] and it just
[19:42] we need to stop sometime and listen amen
[19:44] what god is saying and that's what we're
[19:46] trying to hear already amen
[19:49] let's read this
[19:51] 4th chapter
[19:54] beloved believe not every spirit but try
[19:56] the spirit whether they be of god
[19:59] because many false prophets are gone out
[20:03] into the world
[20:15] that confesses not that jesus christ has
[20:17] come in the flesh is not of god and this
[20:21] is that spirit of antichrist wherever
[20:24] you have heard
[20:26] that it should come
[20:27] and even already is in the world
[20:43] therefore speak they of the world and
[20:45] the world heareth them we are
[20:49] god you're with us
[20:52] he that is not our god
[20:55] hereby holy the spirit of truth
[20:58] and the spirit of heaven
[21:00] beloved let us love one another for love
[21:03] is of god and everyone that loveth is
[21:06] born of god and knoweth god
[21:16] this
[21:17] was manifested the truth i mean would
[21:20] manifest the love of god towards us
[21:23] because that god sent his only begotten
[21:26] son into the world that we might live
[21:29] through him
[21:41] be loved if god so loved us we ought to
[21:44] also
[21:46] to love one another
[21:58] hereby know we that we dwell in him
[22:01] and he and us because he has given us
[22:05] his of his spirit
[22:15] whosoever shall confess that jesus is
[22:17] the son of god
[22:19] god dwelleth in him and he is in god
[22:36] is
[22:37] our love made perfect that we have
[22:40] boldness in the day of judgment because
[22:43] as he is so are we in this world
[22:58] we love him because he first loved us
[23:15] and this is men that we from him
[23:19] that we who love god

[39:06] amen said matthew 24 let me just read
[39:08] from verse one just like to read a few
[39:11] verses
[39:12] down
[39:14] and jesus went out and departed from the
[39:16] temple and his disciples came to him for
[39:19] to show him the buildings of the temple
[39:22] and jesus said unto them
[39:24] see that all these things verily i say
[39:27] unto you they shall not be left one
[39:29] stone upon another that shall not be
[39:32] thrown down
[39:33] and as he sat upon the mount of olives
[39:35] his disciples came to him privately
[39:38] saying
[39:39] tell us
[39:40] when shall these things be
[39:42] and watch her with a sign of thy coming
[39:45] and of the end of the world
[39:48] and jesus answered and said unto them
[39:51] take eid that no man deceive you
[39:53] for many shall come in my name saying i
[39:55] am christ i shall deceive many and he
[39:58] shall hear of wars and rumors of wars
[40:01] and see that he be not troubled for all
[40:04] these things must come to pass but the
[40:06] end is not yet
[40:08] for nation shall rise against nation
[40:11] and kingdom against kingdom and there
[40:13] shall be famine and pestilence and
[40:16] earthquake in diverse places
[40:18] all these are the beginning
[40:20] of sorrows may we bow our heads as we
[40:22] approach the author this morning
[40:25] our gracious god and our father
[40:28] lord god we come to your god believe in
[40:31] you the lord god you are the alpha and
[40:34] the omega
[40:35] lord you are the alpha of our faith this
[40:37] morning and lord god you are our omega
[40:41] lord god you're the one that says open
[40:43] your mouths and i was filled with words
[40:46] therefore lord god we rely not on our
[40:48] own intellect this morning but lord god
[40:50] you know every heart and every vessel
[40:53] that is gathered there this morning lord
[40:55] god you know our needs even more than we
[40:57] know them this morning heavenly father
[40:59] we pray that you take the lumps of clay
[41:02] that you are foreordained and lord god
[41:05] may you use us oh god for your own glory
[41:08] bless every heart
[41:09] remember the sick and the afflicted and
[41:11] the downcast and the dispossessed lord
[41:14] god we pray god by your mercies that oh
[41:18] god you'll be with your children in the
[41:20] troubled world that we're living in
[41:22] bless us now as we look to you and
[41:24] believe you in jesus name we pray amen
[41:28] and amen praise god you may be seated
[41:36] i don't know if everybody reason with
[41:38] themselves and in their heart the way i
[41:40] do
[41:41] but um you know most times the things
[41:44] that i preach and the direction that i
[41:46] go to you know might be i was traveling
[41:50] by myself and i was thinking amen you
[41:52] know something comes in my mind and i
[41:54] begin to reason on this thing and think
[41:57] about it and think what the scripture
[41:58] says and you know bring it to the
[42:00] message and and all of that and and the
[42:02] next thing you know it is something that
[42:04] i'm going to be speaking on right now
[42:06] but you know i mean god deals us in in
[42:09] many different ways and um you know
[42:11] there was something that i was dealing
[42:12] with back home and you know this morning
[42:15] early in the morning i was up early and
[42:17] i was just thinking you know meditating
[42:20] in my heart and the word of god and this
[42:22] thing came to me the importance of a
[42:25] question right
[42:27] you know and that's what i'd like to
[42:29] speak on this morning
[42:30] you know i remember my early years and
[42:33] the message
[42:34] um you know i get to realize that um
[42:37] there were some things you know practice
[42:39] that you you should not do in the
[42:41] position that i was in
[42:43] you know if you see if you ask questions
[42:46] somebody says oh you know he's asking
[42:48] questions and it means like that he's
[42:50] questioning what we believe
[42:53] but bravery you know brother branham
[42:54] said question
[42:55] makes a strong church and i believe that
[42:59] as a believer you've got to ask yourself
[43:02] questions about even your own standing
[43:05] with the lord
[43:07] and so you know i was thinking about
[43:09] this as a you know as i thought you're
[43:12] the importance of questions to a church
[43:15] you know my experience
[43:18] does not
[43:19] might not be your experience of but we
[43:22] find that you know even in our own
[43:24] thoughts
[43:25] if we hold on to something and we never
[43:27] question ourselves then we'll never go
[43:30] any further
[43:31] but even when i claim that i hold on
[43:34] towards the word of god i must question
[43:37] myself like is this really the truth
[43:40] right are you with me
[43:42] now we find that medical science
[43:45] i mean it is based upon questions right
[43:48] you know they they've got a way that and
[43:50] they've dealt with a certain thing one
[43:52] time and hey you know question arises as
[43:56] they begin to research more and i mean
[43:59] more light shine on the things that
[44:00] they're looking at
[44:02] so because there's a question they move
[44:05] to another level
[44:07] you know one time in normal signs it
[44:10] used to be that they thought that the
[44:12] world was flat
[44:14] and everybody feel that when if you
[44:16] travel so far in one direction you're
[44:19] going to reach the end of the earth
[44:22] but something happened and they realized
[44:23] that if you start at one point and you
[44:26] keep going and you're going and you're
[44:27] going you get back to the same point
[44:30] that you were before i mean so there's
[44:32] an improvement in knowledge
[44:34] but the world is not flat but it's work
[44:37] wrong right amen
[44:39] you know brethren the word of god is not
[44:41] based upon the same concept right
[44:44] because it's based upon the divine
[44:47] revelation of god
[44:48] that if a man is a revelation that comes
[44:51] from god he has really the mind of god
[44:55] amen and god is never learning right
[44:59] he's infinite
[45:01] and his first thought is always this
[45:03] thought are you there with me
[45:06] everybody comes to us by revelation when
[45:10] we first earned it
[45:12] and we have it in a concept right and we
[45:15] ponder these things uh hey as you move
[45:18] on with god then god begin to show you
[45:21] and add to your experience
[45:24] amen
[45:25] i remember
[45:26] my early years in preaching you know i
[45:29] started out preaching in you know going
[45:31] with people that were going to the
[45:33] prison and you know we would have meet
[45:35] with the inmates and you know we have a
[45:37] service and you know one time we went
[45:39] and you know there was a a lot of women
[45:41] that takes part in that ministry so
[45:43] whoever the men were then they were the
[45:44] ones that take the lead
[45:46] and so this time we went and um you know
[45:48] one brother went and he went to place
[45:50] guitar and everything and you know
[45:52] there's an experience there when you go
[45:54] through these great big gates and they
[45:56] they close them and the the evan metal
[45:59] begin to shutter it just does something
[46:02] to your nerve
[46:04] and so my friend went with his guitar
[46:06] and when he gets there he realized that
[46:08] you know the tears was just running down
[46:10] his eyes to realize this this fast place
[46:14] and the waste of human life and he just
[46:16] couldn't stop the tears so they said you
[46:18] know brother you've got to preach
[46:20] so that's how i start preaching
[46:23] amen
[46:26] but that was an early experience
[46:29] but you know i traveled to america the
[46:30] first time and i i went around
[46:32] evangelizing and i was at a certain
[46:35] place preaching and i preached the way i
[46:36] always preach and you know i never used
[46:39] to use a quota i did read a few books
[46:41] and and all of that and the brother came
[46:43] up after it preached and he said he said
[46:45] brother i mean you mean to tell me
[46:48] you've you've left from all over the
[46:50] ocean and come here and that was all
[46:52] that you've got to say
[46:55] and i'll tell you what and you know the
[46:57] brothers are with me and you know the
[46:59] ones that took me i was a you know i was
[47:01] just a young man and you know they begin
[47:03] to try to defend me and says you know
[47:05] you should not embarrass the brother
[47:07] like that and so but i tell you one
[47:09] thing it never really embarrassed me
[47:12] it challenged me upon the word of god
[47:15] amen
[47:16] that you are to study the bible to study
[47:19] to show yourself a proof of god
[47:22] a workman that needed not to be ashamed
[47:25] because what we have brethren is that
[47:28] god has sent us a prophet amen you open
[47:31] the word of god to us i mean what is it
[47:34] if we take that word and we put all the
[47:37] books in their places on the shelf and
[47:39] we've never read them and then we go by
[47:42] our own intellect to try to present the
[47:44] word of god
[47:45] are you there with me everybody then we
[47:47] realize there is something in this world
[47:49] right amen brethren i'll tell you every
[47:52] change of life
[47:54] every change of dispensation it started
[47:57] upon questions
[47:59] are you there with me
[48:00] hallelujah and we found that when john
[48:03] the baptist came on the scene even there
[48:05] was the scribes and the pharisees and
[48:07] the sadducees and then all these uh i
[48:10] mean but john came and he came with a
[48:12] message that did not necessarily agree
[48:16] with what they were saying in the day
[48:18] even there were questions that they had
[48:20] and god was going to answer these
[48:22] questions uh him and brethren you know
[48:24] sometimes uh maybe we come and we all
[48:26] want to agree with one another we all
[48:29] want to say what each other say amen
[48:33] but when john came on the scene
[48:35] he came with a message that was radical
[48:39] he came with a message that was
[48:40] different
[48:41] he came with something that let them
[48:43] question their own standing in the word
[48:45] of god
[48:46] him and john him as it came there amen
[48:50] look at this man dressed in rags
[48:52] hallelujah amen john he said and hold
[48:55] the hatches laid onto the root of the
[48:58] tree they never heard that before
[49:00] or you
[49:03] who tell you to flee the rock to come
[49:05] yet brother branham said looking at them
[49:07] in that day you couldn't put a finger on
[49:09] their lives
[49:11] but god was going to bring a change amen
[49:13] are you there with me amen then men
[49:15] begin to realize that there was more of
[49:18] god than we have and they begin to move
[49:21] with the light of god
[49:24] when jesus came
[49:26] hallelujah you know the people are on
[49:28] the great expectation
[49:31] they were looking for a deliverer they
[49:33] wanted a deliverer and if they wanted
[49:35] somebody to come and to remove this
[49:37] roman power he may stand in the position
[49:41] and then hungarian israel would have
[49:43] their king their only power but jesus
[49:46] didn't come for that purpose
[49:48] amen
[49:49] amen
[49:51] we notice the church ages
[49:54] all they came on
[49:55] your brother bran us
[49:57] he said in every new church age begins
[50:00] because
[50:01] him and men begin to fall away
[50:04] and remain begin to question him in what
[50:06] they had
[50:07] amen and god begin to reveal to them you
[50:10] see braver in in question is an inquiry
[50:13] yeah
[50:14] and brother brennan said in that message
[50:15] deep call it onto a deeper he said if
[50:19] there's a more of god to seek after
[50:22] there's a more of god to receive amen
[50:25] are you there with me
[50:26] even if you sit there and never search
[50:29] for any more than you have you will
[50:31] never move from where you are
[50:34] are you there with somebody remember
[50:36] you've got to question it hey man see
[50:38] there's more that i can receive
[50:42] amen
[50:43] when brother branham came out on the
[50:45] scene
[50:46] remember now the turn of the century
[50:49] aiming in jesus street has started him
[50:51] in a brand new move of god and the gifts
[50:54] of the spirit was now in the church
[50:57] potentially amen they begin to move
[50:59] forward amen there were tongues and
[51:02] prophecy
[51:03] and healing and they began to believe
[51:04] god for what the scripture said in the
[51:06] book of acts
[51:08] are you there with me and the church now
[51:10] moves to another foundation
[51:13] and where god was fixing to do something
[51:16] and then god rolls up somebody in the
[51:19] baptist church
[51:21] right in the cradle of the day
[51:24] amen and you know somebody asked a
[51:26] question hey man what about his life
[51:29] because of the ministry god protected
[51:31] that gift
[51:32] and then brought him a certain way
[51:35] amen he questioned the baptist church he
[51:37] read the scripture and he told dr davis
[51:40] he said that when you baptize me i want
[51:42] you to baptize me according to the book
[51:44] of acts yeah right
[51:46] hallelujah
[51:48] god was to do something
[51:50] here all these established churches
[51:53] heyman of the day you had to be in the
[51:56] ransom but somebody
[51:58] came and stepped out of line
[52:01] somebody asked question of the church
[52:03] that there was no answer and so what
[52:06] you've got to do every time there's a
[52:07] question answered and there is no answer
[52:10] that you've got to go seek out and find
[52:13] amen hallelujah is this all that we
[52:16] should have or should there be more
[52:19] amen
[52:20] i notice in the early church
[52:23] the bible says that when they came
[52:25] together
[52:26] they dispute for days upon matters of
[52:30] the word of god
[52:32] and you know in all of those uh they
[52:34] never went away well a few times you've
[52:37] seen the little things uh you know that
[52:38] paul and barnabas they they and they
[52:41] moved to one direction because they were
[52:42] all upset and with the question and the
[52:44] answers and all of that really yeah him
[52:47] and there were men that came in that
[52:48] says hey except you be circumcised after
[52:51] the manner of moses you cannot be saved
[52:53] and they said upon this we had great
[52:55] dispute
[52:56] and people had their feelings hurt
[53:00] hello
[53:01] but what did they do at the end of it
[53:03] right it was moving them on another
[53:05] plane
[53:08] are you there with me right so there's
[53:10] gonna be questions and challenges upon
[53:12] what you believe right now i find this
[53:16] if i don't want to be questioning what i
[53:18] believe
[53:19] it means that what i'm holding on to is
[53:22] really shaky right oh yeah amen
[53:25] hello somebody
[53:27] amen
[53:28] but at first before you actually have
[53:30] got to ask myself
[53:33] because i need to know if this is a
[53:36] truth
[53:38] hallelujah
[53:39] so what a question does
[53:41] it changes the paradigm upon which you
[53:44] believe right amen
[53:46] if there is no question then what we
[53:49] have is a consensus
[53:51] and conformity
[53:53] right of the assumptions and the values
[53:56] of the practice
[53:58] but somebody must step out of the ranks
[54:01] you look when the prophet left off the
[54:03] scene i mean what it was what was the
[54:05] ministry it was the acts of the prophet
[54:08] right well if you never fished with him
[54:10] if you never answered it you had no say
[54:15] hello
[54:16] because that was a paradigm to agree
[54:19] together
[54:20] and every man that stand on the pulpit
[54:22] was merely solving puzzle
[54:25] you know when you give a child a puzzle
[54:28] and they put it together the first time
[54:30] and then what they do it's finished
[54:33] so they pull it apart again
[54:36] and the next time they're going to do it
[54:38] they're going to solve the same puzzle
[54:40] yeah
[54:42] and if you said well if you take a child
[54:45] and you said well i'm going to learn him
[54:47] now
[54:48] technical skills
[54:50] of his motor actions of putting things
[54:53] together
[54:54] and so you buy him a nice puzzle
[54:57] and so today the first day he put the
[55:00] puzzle together and tomorrow you pull
[55:02] the puzzle apart on you he puts it
[55:04] together again and the next day and you
[55:07] do that for one year you know what
[55:08] happened to that child and his mind is
[55:10] deformed right right exactly
[55:14] are you there with me
[55:15] in his mind is the form
[55:18] because he never go any further than he
[55:21] was before
[55:24] brethren can i say would you give me
[55:26] leave to say
[55:27] that in your christian experience
[55:29] might be spiritually there are many
[55:32] deformed people in their spirit because
[55:35] they never challenge the word of god or
[55:37] never move out of the paradigm that they
[55:40] stand upon
[55:41] amen
[55:42] and so what we have is concepts
[55:45] and the values of how we dress and
[55:47] conduct ourselves and the practices that
[55:50] we have in the church but brethren we're
[55:53] in a quest
[55:54] not to stay here
[55:56] we're in a quest to get out of here
[56:00] so something's gonna happen
[56:02] somebody's gonna step on the line
[56:05] and tell me something that will change
[56:07] my money
[56:08] exactly
[56:10] right
[56:11] that's right when brother brennan
[56:12] preached the seals what he did
[56:14] he went to question and answers
[56:17] and you know they said well
[56:19] well these questions
[56:21] never match what he preached
[56:24] but i answered the question
[56:26] what could they ask
[56:28] because the position that they were in
[56:31] when you're true preaching the seals
[56:32] they had no more revelation than they
[56:35] had when they started to preach it
[56:37] exactly
[56:39] hello
[56:41] and brethren you got to be honest with
[56:42] yourself it took you years
[56:46] to even start to conceptualize the
[56:49] things that he was really saying
[56:51] back then
[56:52] hello somebody and i tell you i took up
[56:55] all notes that i preached on and i've
[56:57] looked at it again and i said my i start
[57:00] to write more things to it because i see
[57:03] more light upon that very verse and that
[57:06] very quote that i've read before
[57:09] amen you know so somebody comes along
[57:11] and they said i mean i have you ever
[57:13] read
[57:14] christ the mystery of god revealed well
[57:15] i've read it 10 times why don't you read
[57:18] it again right exactly
[57:20] right hello somebody
[57:22] well why don't you read it again
[57:25] and update your experience in the word
[57:28] of god
[57:29] i mean somebody said and then what about
[57:32] marriage and divorce but i've heard that
[57:33] already
[57:34] i mean but why don't you read it again
[57:37] hello somebody and update
[57:43] so jesus was not afraid of questions
[57:47] so here it is
[57:49] the glory of jerusalem in the day
[57:52] was a temple that solomon built
[57:56] if there was a visitor in jerusalem
[57:59] you couldn't leave the city without
[58:02] seeing this right
[58:03] and so they begin to show him
[58:06] this building they need to tell him and
[58:09] when he was dedicated
[58:12] the priest could not even miss him right
[58:15] because the glory of god was in the
[58:18] house that day
[58:19] oh man what a story and jesus
[58:24] i didn't heard that
[58:26] they thought that he would have said my
[58:30] oh glory let me go in it
[58:33] let me read upon the history
[58:36] jesus said see all this
[58:38] there shall not be left one stone upon
[58:40] another that shall not be pulled down
[58:42] right
[58:43] my
[58:45] hello
[58:46] exactly
[58:47] it's challenging now right the pride of
[58:51] the city
[58:52] is challenging now that which they stand
[58:55] upon
[58:56] and so
[58:57] what it does is generate questions
[59:02] because you seem to have something that
[59:04] is different
[59:05] brethren i'll tell you what i'm not
[59:07] afraid of something that seems different
[59:10] right but you've got to test it by the
[59:12] urine right now
[59:14] you're there with somebody
[59:17] hello because i tell you if you can't
[59:19] stand up to this
[59:21] you've got to put it out right right
[59:24] amen
[59:25] your people say well we we know more now
[59:28] than brother brennan knew back then
[59:31] if what he had was divine revelation
[59:34] then that was the mind of god right and
[59:37] you're telling me that 40 years after
[59:40] god has learnt more
[59:45] hello
[59:46] as god learn tomorrow
[59:49] hello somebody am i right but yet there
[59:52] was a lot said that we just never get it
[59:55] you've got to be honest with yourselves
[59:58] hello and you know i said well when i
[1:00:01] see this hey man you know the 1985 when
[1:00:05] i came in but i need to look at it again
[1:00:08] yeah hello somebody
[1:00:10] amen because the old experience that you
[1:00:13] had
[1:00:14] if that'll bring you to a camping off
[1:00:16] you wouldn't be here this morning
[1:00:19] but god has more for you right right and
[1:00:21] that's why you're here so bravery let us
[1:00:24] realize
[1:00:25] that god is still in the fixing business
[1:00:29] you still working on me
[1:00:31] to make me what i ought to be
[1:00:33] hallelujah so we've had normal times
[1:00:38] right hello
[1:00:39] and we really glow in there the normal
[1:00:42] times that we have where everything was
[1:00:46] instability right yeah
[1:00:49] you know you know
[1:00:50] nothing happened that caused a star or a
[1:00:54] change or a challenge of what we believe
[1:00:57] right and brethren i came up and women
[1:01:00] thank god for false doctrine
[1:01:03] because they let us challenge how we
[1:01:04] believe and tested by the word and see
[1:01:07] if these things are the truth sorry
[1:01:11] glory bro i i tell you the true believer
[1:01:14] you ain't got a fear false doctrine you
[1:01:16] see brother unfair and then i'm getting
[1:01:18] to thoughts i gotta fear that all right
[1:01:21] right
[1:01:22] do you know what you've got on the
[1:01:24] inside yeah right that's right and you
[1:01:26] know the only reason you don't know what
[1:01:28] you've got is because it has not been
[1:01:30] put to the test
[1:01:33] right amen
[1:01:35] hallelujah
[1:01:39] so they asked him the question
[1:01:41] three simple questions
[1:01:43] when shall these things be
[1:01:45] now i'd like to say that scripture
[1:01:47] has double meaning
[1:01:49] and yet jesus was standing right there
[1:01:51] with them
[1:01:52] and he was answering their question but
[1:01:55] yet there is still a portion of that
[1:01:57] question still hanging today
[1:02:02] right when shall this when shall it be
[1:02:06] that there will not be one stone upon
[1:02:08] another right if there is a bible
[1:02:11] question
[1:02:12] there is an answer
[1:02:14] and i'll tell you one thing i've learned
[1:02:17] is that when a question is
[1:02:19] you you know i i've got that with me if
[1:02:22] somebody asks me a question i start to
[1:02:23] talk
[1:02:25] it's not a strength it's a weakness
[1:02:28] because sometimes you start to answer
[1:02:30] before you really consider the question
[1:02:35] i know you're you're mad of god well
[1:02:37] you're different from me but
[1:02:39] i i tell i'll tell you that's the way i
[1:02:40] am if you ask me a question i started to
[1:02:42] say something amen without sometimes
[1:02:44] even considering the question right
[1:02:47] jesus tell them he could have simply
[1:02:49] said for under titus in 1870 he meant
[1:02:52] this is going to be destroyed
[1:02:54] but yet there was something for the
[1:02:56] believer at that day
[1:02:59] he said matthew 24 15 jesus began to
[1:03:02] tell them
[1:03:03] and yet as jesus was telling them what
[1:03:06] would have happened in that day there
[1:03:07] was an element of that for you today
[1:03:10] right amen
[1:03:11] amen right
[1:03:13] you see
[1:03:14] i'm praying that your flight been out
[1:03:15] like winter
[1:03:17] or in the summer day when they were the
[1:03:18] door of the city with the gate of the
[1:03:19] city will be closed
[1:03:21] either it's in jerusalem very niconda
[1:03:23] and they also let not come down and take
[1:03:25] his stuff out and i'm gonna flee into
[1:03:27] the mountains
[1:03:28] amen and all that had great significance
[1:03:33] but he speaks of the abomination that
[1:03:35] make a desolation when you see it
[1:03:37] standing in the holy place
[1:03:39] hello somebody
[1:03:41] but right there on that spot of rock
[1:03:44] that's holy ground from god there is a
[1:03:46] mosque of omaha may i say that
[1:03:49] christianity today has no place in
[1:03:52] jerusalem
[1:03:53] exactly
[1:03:55] because it's the abomination
[1:03:57] that make it desolate but then you go
[1:04:00] back to prophecy and you know that it's
[1:04:02] going to be moved out of its place
[1:04:04] hello somebody and so when you see these
[1:04:07] things fixing to happen
[1:04:09] it's not the end but it's coming close
[1:04:11] to the end
[1:04:13] right right you know the bible speaks as
[1:04:15] jesus begin to tell them i wonder how
[1:04:18] much they understood
[1:04:20] from what he was saying that day right
[1:04:22] and maybe all the understanding they had
[1:04:25] was to write these things down
[1:04:29] but aren't we thanking god that they did
[1:04:31] amen
[1:04:33] are you there with me somebody right
[1:04:35] you know the bible he says simple things
[1:04:38] and when were ready for for nation shall
[1:04:41] rise against nation
[1:04:43] he said brother keith but but today
[1:04:46] we're the world is stable
[1:04:48] yeah you know brethren i find that the
[1:04:51] time when people think that the world is
[1:04:53] stable
[1:04:54] it's the greatest war that there is
[1:04:57] right you know we said let us talk about
[1:05:00] the wars of our day yeah you know i was
[1:05:03] reading
[1:05:04] that the the u.s
[1:05:06] economy has always had a trade deficit
[1:05:10] in other words you are taking in more
[1:05:14] than you are sending out
[1:05:15] right and you know if you've got a
[1:05:18] business and you're buying in more than
[1:05:20] you're putting out then really you're in
[1:05:22] the red right
[1:05:25] brother branham said this nation is
[1:05:28] busting you're right
[1:05:29] hello somebody right now you said well
[1:05:31] look at all that we've got i mean i
[1:05:33] traveled over jamaica
[1:05:44] and i was looking at the us economy that
[1:05:47] is always
[1:05:49] in the red yeah because you consume more
[1:05:52] than you earn right
[1:05:54] right
[1:05:55] and i was looking
[1:05:57] in 1990 and 91
[1:06:00] when there was desert
[1:06:02] storm they said
[1:06:05] it says that those were some of the few
[1:06:07] years
[1:06:09] that the u.s economy
[1:06:12] came out of the ring yeah right yet we
[1:06:15] say but that's times of war
[1:06:19] that's not the real battle right i know
[1:06:22] somebody but when you think it's peace
[1:06:24] and safety
[1:06:26] you know why you flourish that time
[1:06:29] because the allied nations were giving
[1:06:32] to america
[1:06:33] and they gave you more than you spent
[1:06:36] and so you came out of the red right but
[1:06:39] ever since that time this nation's
[1:06:42] economy is in the red exactly right
[1:06:44] hello
[1:06:45] and i i just show you a simple way
[1:06:48] that it's happening
[1:06:50] there are things that we're not looking
[1:06:52] at
[1:06:53] when we trade as nations
[1:06:56] you know
[1:06:57] i mean you you go and go back home and
[1:06:59] look in your cupboards and take all the
[1:07:02] products that you consume
[1:07:04] and look where they're made
[1:07:07] right
[1:07:09] look at the things that you love to eat
[1:07:12] and find out where they come from
[1:07:15] that if the borders are closed
[1:07:19] hello somebody
[1:07:21] if the borders become closed
[1:07:23] and you don't realize that your
[1:07:25] governments are closing down the borders
[1:07:28] and making heaviness about the nation
[1:07:31] but if they close the borders you're
[1:07:34] going to really suffer
[1:07:36] because you can't produce enough
[1:07:39] of what you're consuming
[1:07:42] hello somebody
[1:07:44] but you go to another nation
[1:07:47] go to china
[1:07:48] and you said oh but we are exporting to
[1:07:51] china and go find the american product
[1:07:54] in china
[1:07:57] it's there but where did they put it
[1:07:59] they put it where the people can't get
[1:08:01] it right
[1:08:04] and so what is it it's a battle
[1:08:07] a train right
[1:08:09] the nation shall rise against nations
[1:08:12] and kingdoms shall rise against kingdoms
[1:08:17] but you take a nation like england
[1:08:20] where the head
[1:08:22] of state
[1:08:25] is the queen
[1:08:27] but you know in actual fact the queen is
[1:08:30] just a figurehead
[1:08:32] that the house of lords
[1:08:35] in england which is a
[1:08:37] law-making body consisted of over 600
[1:08:41] persons
[1:08:42] that the state had to feed them and care
[1:08:44] for them
[1:08:45] and they were there because of their
[1:08:48] lineage and positions and all of that
[1:08:50] really
[1:08:51] and so when tony blair was in power what
[1:08:53] he did he cut that down
[1:08:56] they were carrying as a nation too much
[1:08:58] baggage
[1:09:01] and so
[1:09:03] kingdoms against kingdom
[1:09:05] and politics were to listen to amen the
[1:09:08] the iraqi of the palace
[1:09:12] but the ants are turning around
[1:09:15] why because brethren that's prophecy in
[1:09:19] the name kingdom
[1:09:20] and many countries the kings of satan i
[1:09:24] speak ahead and feed from the people but
[1:09:26] what do they contribute to the people
[1:09:30] there is an inanimate somewhere
[1:09:33] and we think that the system of religion
[1:09:36] is set up to protect you
[1:09:39] you know somebody yeah
[1:09:41] we said oh why is it to that we don't do
[1:09:44] like the others do we don't go away they
[1:09:46] go we don't partake of the things that
[1:09:48] they partake of because god sent us a
[1:09:50] word advice in this day
[1:09:53] to wake us up and let us realize
[1:09:56] that the only ones that will not be
[1:09:57] deceived are those names that are
[1:10:00] written in the book amen
[1:10:03] amen
[1:10:05] find out where you're standing today
[1:10:08] find out your position
[1:10:11] he said
[1:10:12] this is the most
[1:10:14] deceiving age that there is
[1:10:18] hallelujah
[1:10:19] and so the first thing jesus tells them
[1:10:22] take heed that no man deceive you
[1:10:24] and you know peter must have been
[1:10:26] looking at john and says hey
[1:10:28] but but it's just us
[1:10:31] hey are you going to deceive me well i'm
[1:10:34] going to deceive you
[1:10:35] so what is he really saying yeah
[1:10:38] hello somebody right well what is he
[1:10:40] really saying
[1:10:42] remember right now brethren we take it
[1:10:45] within the framework of the church
[1:10:50] and you know
[1:10:52] back home i just had about
[1:10:54] six funerals in a row
[1:10:56] and so every time i started to preach
[1:10:58] there was a dead body right there before
[1:11:00] me
[1:11:01] and so i was scared other people would
[1:11:03] get in that condition
[1:11:05] but you know
[1:11:08] within the framework of the church
[1:11:10] you've got to watch it
[1:11:12] people said well you know i i nobody say
[1:11:15] anything bad about me until i come to
[1:11:17] church
[1:11:18] you know i i live a good life i i mean i
[1:11:21] always had friends
[1:11:22] but you know they they tell me they said
[1:11:24] brother another kid
[1:11:25] you know this happened to me and you you
[1:11:27] know what caused it brethren yeah
[1:11:29] brethren did this to me
[1:11:31] i said but it's a trying on your face
[1:11:34] and you know i'm not a guy who's very
[1:11:36] sensitive to things i said i said you
[1:11:38] want to talk about somebody talk about
[1:11:40] me because i'll tell you if you're a
[1:11:41] christian somebody's going to talk about
[1:11:43] you
[1:11:44] amen you know we want somebody to say
[1:11:47] the good things about you hey i'll tell
[1:11:48] you one thing the good things about you
[1:11:50] there's nothing to hold a
[1:11:52] conversation so they're gonna find
[1:11:55] something that doesn't look too good
[1:11:57] it's just the experience of a christian
[1:12:00] amen and so somebody leave the church
[1:12:02] and he said hey well what's your problem
[1:12:04] why you leave the church you know
[1:12:05] because they didn't really agree with me
[1:12:07] and they said this about me really hey
[1:12:10] i want you to find a house where they
[1:12:12] don't say nothing about you
[1:12:16] it's a spirit of deception
[1:12:19] i know somebody we want everybody to
[1:12:21] love everybody and everybody to say nice
[1:12:23] things about somebody
[1:12:25] oh britain i'll tell you what might be
[1:12:27] the things that are said about me where
[1:12:29] i am who i am today right exactly are
[1:12:32] you there with me
[1:12:34] you know i remember an experience i had
[1:12:36] when my boss called me
[1:12:38] he said
[1:12:40] i i'm
[1:12:42] i'm not
[1:12:43] reprimanding you he said i'm
[1:12:46] just trying to counsel you
[1:12:48] i said okay sir so i sit in the chair
[1:12:50] and you know in everything that they do
[1:12:52] you don't know it but there's a
[1:12:53] psychology to it
[1:12:55] and he sits in a real small chair and
[1:12:58] what he has in front of is a large big
[1:13:00] chair and so he said sit right there
[1:13:03] and so
[1:13:04] he's fill his chair but in your chair
[1:13:08] it's so wide so you look like like a
[1:13:10] little
[1:13:11] grasshopper to this monster
[1:13:15] there's a reason why they do that
[1:13:18] and so he began to tell me he said you
[1:13:20] know he said keith
[1:13:22] he said people say that uh
[1:13:25] you you always stuck in one position you
[1:13:27] you you don't really change
[1:13:29] you said uh
[1:13:31] and um you know
[1:13:33] we feel that um you know you're not
[1:13:35] really open to new ideas and and things
[1:13:38] like that and so and you know he begins
[1:13:41] to counsel and i sit with him and i
[1:13:42] listen to him carefully
[1:13:44] and um when it was true he said uh do
[1:13:47] you have anything to say i said i said
[1:13:48] no sir thank you very much and um you
[1:13:51] know i left
[1:13:53] and so you know i know what he was doing
[1:13:56] he thought that well i really haven't
[1:13:58] known
[1:13:59] i really get him
[1:14:00] because he says
[1:14:02] um i'm not going to reprimand you but
[1:14:05] that's what he's trying to do yeah and
[1:14:07] so what i did
[1:14:08] you know i went out and i i said well
[1:14:10] i've got to examine myself and i got to
[1:14:13] see you know what i need to do to
[1:14:14] improve what he says i'm not trying to
[1:14:17] find out if what he said is the truth or
[1:14:19] not
[1:14:20] because that's where we make our
[1:14:21] mistakes many times
[1:14:24] we're trying to
[1:14:25] search for the truth of what somebody
[1:14:27] say about you
[1:14:29] when what you ought to do is to work to
[1:14:31] improve right what the person say you
[1:14:34] are
[1:14:34] exactly because you know i i might tell
[1:14:36] you brother where if i said to brother i
[1:14:39] said bro
[1:14:40] you're just a guy that is hardening the
[1:14:43] past
[1:14:44] you know from the time i know you you've
[1:14:46] never changed you know brother wade
[1:14:47] could go to my big brother
[1:14:50] uh some another brother and says you
[1:14:52] know brother brother keith said this
[1:14:54] about me what do you think he's trying
[1:14:56] to formulate opinions to agree with his
[1:14:59] feelings
[1:15:01] and so you know what i did i i went and
[1:15:02] i i started to you know i've left
[1:15:06] college for that time might be uh
[1:15:08] 15 years or so so i said maybe i really
[1:15:11] get ruled in my thoughts so i go back
[1:15:14] you know and i start studying again and
[1:15:16] so you know the other day was leaving
[1:15:18] and he said to me he said keith he said
[1:15:20] there's something about you he said
[1:15:22] whatever you have to do you deliver it
[1:15:24] and you deliver it before time i said
[1:15:27] thank you sir and he was leaving now and
[1:15:29] you know you begin to tell me all the
[1:15:30] good things and you know he said i said
[1:15:32] sir i said remember the day when you you
[1:15:34] sit and you talk with me i said i took
[1:15:37] everything that you said and i began to
[1:15:39] improve on them really
[1:15:41] he couldn't believe it
[1:15:43] he couldn't believe
[1:15:44] but you know brethren that's what we
[1:15:46] ought to do
[1:15:48] that's what we ought to do
[1:15:50] you know we're trying to find an
[1:15:51] approval
[1:15:53] yeah for our position right right you
[1:15:56] know brethren i think what we we said
[1:15:58] well one thing i know i said well i i
[1:16:00] got the word and you know if i stand
[1:16:03] with anything i've got the word
[1:16:05] you know i need to be careful that in me
[1:16:08] having the word
[1:16:09] i stay in the position that i'm in with
[1:16:11] the word and not move on in the world
[1:16:16] are you with me
[1:16:18] and so bret i'll tell you a challenge
[1:16:20] will come from every side
[1:16:22] hallelujah let no man deceive you by any
[1:16:26] means
[1:16:27] one thing we know the elect cannot be
[1:16:30] deceived
[1:16:31] hello somebody but you know you can take
[1:16:34] everything that they say about you
[1:16:36] hello
[1:16:37] you know somebody said one time well
[1:16:40] your brother keith is a legalist and so
[1:16:42] i begin to go to find over the meaning
[1:16:45] of that really and i try to by the fact
[1:16:47] try to fight to justify that no i'm not
[1:16:50] because to be a legalist is this no i i
[1:16:52] don't need to do that right right i just
[1:16:55] take what you say
[1:16:56] and i begin to use that as a stepping
[1:16:59] stone
[1:17:00] and question myself upon these things
[1:17:03] real life now brethren as a believer you
[1:17:06] never have the approval of the masses
[1:17:09] don't try to get it
[1:17:11] hello somebody or if you fall on the
[1:17:13] line with god remember i tell you
[1:17:16] there's something there that's gonna
[1:17:18] challenge your faith to let you read the
[1:17:20] word brother brad said amen i'd rather
[1:17:22] be having tried to receive the holy
[1:17:25] ghost having already received it they
[1:17:28] have to be
[1:17:29] thinking that i've received it and i
[1:17:32] i got it
[1:17:33] right
[1:17:37] seeking to know nothing right as though
[1:17:39] i know nothing right that i might learn
[1:17:42] christ right
[1:17:43] for many shall come in my name saying
[1:17:46] i am christ
[1:17:48] i shall receive many
[1:17:51] many great anointing
[1:17:54] many great
[1:17:56] and in standing up on the concept
[1:17:58] that we believe
[1:18:00] but brethren challenge these things amen
[1:18:05] if a challenge come by the world what do
[1:18:07] we do
[1:18:08] do we say well i mean they're trying to
[1:18:10] challenge it hey let me prove it more
[1:18:13] let me prove it more go back and see if
[1:18:16] these things could be the truth right
[1:18:19] you know what i'll tell you one thing we
[1:18:20] never usually take time out today to
[1:18:22] listen to each other right
[1:18:25] we really don't listen to each other you
[1:18:27] know i i believe that they believe this
[1:18:29] and i and they believe that i believe
[1:18:31] this and we we never could have come
[1:18:33] together brother dale and said well let
[1:18:36] us i want you to speak and why you
[1:18:38] believe about this thing really
[1:18:40] you know one thing we don't know if you
[1:18:42] invite the minister over to preach a
[1:18:44] meeting you you don't tell him that hey
[1:18:46] man i want you to preach on this

[1:19:03] don't come preaching whatever you feel
[1:19:05] like preaching where you little i wanted
[1:19:07] to preach on this
[1:19:09] because we want to be challenged on what
[1:19:11] we believe right right and if i never
[1:19:15] heard anybody say it outside of what i
[1:19:17] believe how will i have a challenge to

[1:19:33] dave over the years somebody had to step
[1:19:36] out of line
[1:19:37] somebody had to say something that was
[1:19:39] even contrary to what everybody else
[1:19:42] believed
[1:19:43] and then men begin to seek out these
[1:19:45] things
[1:19:46] and see if it's the truth
[1:19:52] hello
[1:19:53] you know they said well well when joe
[1:19:55] coleman preached about the thunders
[1:19:58] but your nightmare that was an opening
[1:20:00] of a door right yeah of somebody to get
[1:20:02] into the message and to say what the
[1:20:04] prophet says
[1:20:06] hello somebody amen it's a question
[1:20:08] whether it was right or wrong
[1:20:10] but it opened a door
[1:20:13] that somebody's gonna stand up on
[1:20:15] something all right and if you challenge
[1:20:17] what somebody else believes then what do
[1:20:19] you believe about us right amen the
[1:20:22] importance of a question
[1:20:25] challenge it
[1:20:27] it's an inquiry
[1:20:29] and there's an inquiry about something
[1:20:32] we need an answer into it

[1:20:36] grammar question one of the greatest
[1:20:38] questions i've seen halloween all the
[1:20:41] volume of condacorn doctrine
[1:20:43] what about the translation of the bride
[1:20:46] yeah right what about it exactly and
[1:20:49] brother branham said something that was
[1:20:51] really so simple he said it's just a
[1:20:54] change

[1:20:56] just a change
[1:20:59] and you say oh what about the
[1:21:01] translation of the breath it is just a
[1:21:04] change

[1:21:13] bill i only cost 40 then i'm going to
[1:21:15] get back some change
[1:21:18] you know
[1:21:19] it's just a change
[1:21:21] but he went on
[1:21:23] hallelujah
[1:21:24] amen right and when he went down he
[1:21:27] talks about abram himself
[1:21:29] amen who cannot bring forth seed because
[1:21:32] there's no life of conception
[1:21:35] it's just a change right he's still with
[1:21:39] a question now
[1:21:40] but it's just a change
[1:21:43] just to change what's in you now yeah
[1:21:46] right a question
[1:21:48] hallelujah
[1:21:50] come on with me
[1:21:52] so simple right now just a change when
[1:21:55] he went on right glory
[1:21:57] what is this change
[1:21:59] hello
[1:22:02] amen
[1:22:03] and abram and sarah could bring forth
[1:22:06] the sun
[1:22:08] because you know she was born all right
[1:22:11] you know she couldn't bring forth seed
[1:22:14] hello right amen but he said god did
[1:22:17] something
[1:22:18] amen it turned abram to a young man
[1:22:21] again i turned sarah back to a young
[1:22:24] woman oh you mean it's just a change
[1:22:26] right we're still in the change now
[1:22:29] but look at the change
[1:22:31] and what change abraham you see what
[1:22:34] abraham now
[1:22:36] now in this way brother branham said
[1:22:40] what he had
[1:22:42] he kept walking
[1:22:44] amen he kept walking amen and as he
[1:22:48] walked
[1:22:50] are you there with me somebody as he
[1:22:52] walked he didn't mean putting one sec
[1:22:54] before another right as he progressed
[1:22:58] and in the old testament the bible said
[1:23:00] abram believed god that belief is faith
[1:23:03] he had faith in what god says sorry
[1:23:06] hallelujah and as he kept this faith it
[1:23:09] materialized
[1:23:12] amen that's the change but what tells
[1:23:14] you oh it's a metamorphosis
[1:23:16] amen
[1:23:18] it seems like what it wasn't before but
[1:23:21] yet there was something there right that
[1:23:24] god was using
[1:23:26] that which he had his faith
[1:23:28] hallelujah what a change it's going to
[1:23:30] be
[1:23:31] brave when i say what am i'm talking
[1:23:33] about this and i still haven't tried to
[1:23:36] figure out what the prophet really said
[1:23:39] right
[1:23:40] it's just
[1:23:42] a change
[1:23:46] that i believe god glory
[1:23:50] i remember as a young man
[1:23:52] when i was in high school
[1:23:55] there were days when i i just felt
[1:23:57] the power of god
[1:23:59] on me
[1:24:01] then there was something come over me
[1:24:03] i wanted to be prayed for by christians
[1:24:07] i just know that
[1:24:08] there was like a call
[1:24:11] there was something i need more of god
[1:24:12] and i quit going to church
[1:24:17] you know
[1:24:18] but i know that there was something
[1:24:20] there somewhere
[1:24:22] i'll tell you another experience
[1:24:24] in jamaica we have
[1:24:26] what we call
[1:24:28] the revival people
[1:24:30] spiritualism
[1:24:32] and i remember when i was a child they
[1:24:34] came into our community
[1:24:35] and they came to my house and i told my
[1:24:38] mom they said you know what one minor
[1:24:40] one time he came and he you wanted my
[1:24:42] mom to
[1:24:43] give me the little young man because
[1:24:45] there's a call of god in his life
[1:24:48] i don't understand these things
[1:24:50] hello
[1:24:51] yeah i didn't i didn't live like a
[1:24:54] christian i didn't do anything that i
[1:24:56] was supposed to do
[1:24:57] are you there with me
[1:24:59] but for yeah there was something there
[1:25:00] that i didn't understand right but then
[1:25:03] god
[1:25:04] began to materialize that experience
[1:25:07] the god that i was searching for
[1:25:10] he
[1:25:15] there were things that i mean i'd see
[1:25:17] them do
[1:25:18] and there was something about it
[1:25:20] but i just don't have the desire to do
[1:25:22] that yeah
[1:25:23] it's just convict me if i do that
[1:25:26] because there was something there
[1:25:27] somewhere
[1:25:28] hallelujah and so i i i came to a point
[1:25:32] in my life that what i started to do i
[1:25:34] start to ask questions oh yeah
[1:25:37] i read the bible
[1:25:38] yeah let no men fool you through
[1:25:40] philosophy and very deceit after the
[1:25:43] things of the world and not after christ
[1:25:45] and i began to ask questions of people i
[1:25:47] thought that should know
[1:25:51] and i know if there's a question there
[1:25:53] somewhere
[1:25:54] there's an answer but i didn't know
[1:25:56] where to turn yeah right i didn't know
[1:25:59] where to turn to find the answer
[1:26:01] but god
[1:26:02] works on two ends
[1:26:05] you know i remember when i first met
[1:26:07] henry brady at school you know we live
[1:26:10] in
[1:26:11] inland and he lives by by the beach
[1:26:13] and i'll tell you what an holiday he
[1:26:15] invited us to be at his house i mean we
[1:26:18] want to go
[1:26:19] his father is a pastor they go to church
[1:26:21] but hey that don't concern us really we
[1:26:23] want to go to the beach
[1:26:28] i think we go and we we we we we give
[1:26:31] moments and sit there in church and
[1:26:33] listen but then tomorrow
[1:26:35] this is a real thing
[1:26:37] and you know
[1:26:39] friends that we used to travel with and
[1:26:41] go there together everybody are still
[1:26:43] the same way today yeah right
[1:26:45] and something got a hold of me right
[1:26:48] it's just
[1:26:54] and god's gonna take you out of this
[1:26:56] that you are in this morning
[1:26:58] and how will it be
[1:27:00] brethren i'll tell you what we're gonna
[1:27:02] stand one day in the position of
[1:27:03] almighty god

[1:27:09] before us they're waiting on us amen for
[1:27:12] this change yes sir are you here with me

[1:27:26] aspects of our lives that this change
[1:27:28] has encompassed
[1:27:30] it's just a change
[1:27:32] but breaking what i know these are the
[1:27:35] words that i believe now right
[1:27:38] that might be i struggle with the lying
[1:27:40] there in the bed and i go to the public
[1:27:42] and i preach a message and then i go
[1:27:45] back home in my corner and i'm
[1:27:47] challenged yeah

[1:27:50] and i say to myself i'm going to change
[1:27:53] direction i'm not going to continue with
[1:27:55] that because i don't know if they're
[1:27:57] getting it i don't know if they see what

[1:32:49] oh hallelujah
[1:32:52] you said oh you know we were a bible
[1:32:54] study
[1:32:55] there there were some questions
[1:32:57] but sister so-and-so
[1:32:59] asked a question
[1:33:01] yeah
[1:33:02] you know brother dale had to go back
[1:33:04] that night and
[1:33:05] he couldn't sleep
[1:33:07] i don't know i guess might be all
[1:33:08] preachers is like that yeah but you pace
[1:33:10] the floor
[1:33:11] you think about it
[1:33:13] and god really wants to bring it to
[1:33:15] something but you you've got to go back
[1:33:17] and and look somewhere where he said
[1:33:19] something and go to the scripture
[1:33:21] because you have no peace until you have
[1:33:24] that release right right
[1:33:26] it's just in your change
[1:33:29] the brethren do we realize the
[1:33:30] tremendous responsibility yes
[1:33:33] what we say to one another
[1:33:35] one day
[1:33:36] one day
[1:33:38] your body
[1:33:39] will be released
[1:33:41] of all the sufferings of this time
[1:33:45] i remember i was preaching there in
[1:33:47] church just a few weeks ago
[1:33:50] and i was sister staring mom
[1:33:52] she was sitting she always said to my
[1:33:54] right
[1:33:56] and you know there's people it's kind of
[1:33:58] like you're aiming connor
[1:34:00] and so you always focus on them
[1:34:02] amen
[1:34:04] because they they kind of give a little
[1:34:05] bit of approval
[1:34:07] right
[1:34:08] yeah
[1:34:09] and i was preaching about this and i
[1:34:11] said what job said and she threw her
[1:34:13] hands in the air and started regis
[1:34:16] she said you know
[1:34:17] so she
[1:34:18] she don't believe she have the fit
[1:34:20] to make the change
[1:34:22] she's gonna go by the grave
[1:34:24] i was preaching
[1:34:26] and something just got a hold of me i
[1:34:27] felt so strong about it i said mom
[1:34:30] and i tell you what
[1:34:32] and that blood pressure that keep it
[1:34:34] going up and down and up and down so you
[1:34:36] ain't gonna worry about it no more
[1:34:38] because it will all be all right
[1:34:41] two weeks after
[1:34:43] two weeks after yeah she was there
[1:34:45] sitting
[1:34:46] said she was watching a preaching tape
[1:34:48] with submission
[1:34:49] and she just got upset she
[1:34:51] feel like going to bed and she stand up
[1:34:53] on her feet
[1:34:54] and she said jesus and she felt right
[1:34:56] back there and that was it she was gone
[1:34:59] amen brethren
[1:35:01] it's just a change
[1:35:03] and it tells you when you see these
[1:35:04] things
[1:35:06] hallelujah that my change
[1:35:09] is in preview
[1:35:10] came back and i tell the church
[1:35:13] so we talk about these things
[1:35:15] and we said the dead saints that have
[1:35:16] gone before us
[1:35:18] they're gonna come back
[1:35:19] and when you see them then you know
[1:35:22] hello
[1:35:23] like jesus resurrection
[1:35:26] and they appeared unto many i said who
[1:35:28] is it that's going to be on that side
[1:35:30] for the deal
[1:35:32] you know you've got some that's gone and
[1:35:34] on the other side
[1:35:35] to god you're not certain
[1:35:38] you're really not certain where they
[1:35:40] stand with god yes they serve god for
[1:35:42] many years
[1:35:44] when you come to the summation of their
[1:35:46] lives you question right yeah that's a
[1:35:49] little truth right
[1:35:51] but when you know a faithful one that's
[1:35:52] on the other side
[1:35:54] it's an advocate you've got
[1:35:56] when i see you again then i know
[1:35:59] right i'm in the change
[1:36:01] what a question
[1:36:03] brethren i'll tell you what as you read
[1:36:05] it
[1:36:06] question yourselves
[1:36:09] we're not questioning god
[1:36:11] because god has already given it to us
[1:36:13] amen but we're asking each other
[1:36:16] amen
[1:36:17] and what do you see in what you say
[1:36:20] do you really believe it
[1:36:22] brethren
[1:36:27] it doesn't matter what happened to me
[1:36:30] i believe the word is true amen
[1:36:33] i believe brethren that the dead saints
[1:36:35] are gonna come and walk on the face of
[1:36:37] the earth
[1:36:38] and i believe we're gonna have a body
[1:36:40] change
[1:36:41] amen
[1:36:42] and i believe that problems that you've
[1:36:44] got in your bodies know i know they're
[1:36:46] gonna leave you because brethren we can
[1:36:49] prove them by scripture
[1:36:51] scriptural proof and the reality is
[1:36:54] right there before us all right amen
[1:36:57] right hallelujah amen the importance of
[1:36:59] questions
[1:37:00] it brings on what god want to say to you
[1:37:03] exactly
[1:37:04] so they asked jesus a question you know
[1:37:06] what he did he turned around and asked
[1:37:08] them a question right and when he asked
[1:37:10] them the question you know what they did
[1:37:12] they begin to murmur the answer that
[1:37:15] they already know yeah right but if we
[1:37:18] say he's gonna say yeah
[1:37:20] right
[1:37:21] because they already know they are
[1:37:22] concerned
[1:37:23] but they want him to say something else
[1:37:25] yeah yeah right right yeah what do you
[1:37:28] want to hear this morning right what do
[1:37:30] you want to hear
[1:37:32] hello somebody right you want to hear
[1:37:34] that you can live anyhow when you still
[1:37:35] make it
[1:37:37] hello
[1:37:39] you want to hear you can stop exactly
[1:37:41] where you are and walk out and say well
[1:37:43] i'm predestination i'm gonna go no
[1:37:45] further
[1:37:48] if you were you would continue in your
[1:37:50] position
[1:37:52] i believe in the end of the display
[1:37:55] brother branham said god knowing what he
[1:37:58] would do
[1:38:03] hello
[1:38:04] you said well i can stay home i don't
[1:38:07] gotta come no more i've got i've got
[1:38:09] enough tapes i've i've heard enough
[1:38:16] how many times a scroll was read
[1:38:18] in nazareth before he came that day
[1:38:21] but that day when he came he found the
[1:38:23] place where it was written right there's
[1:38:26] a scripture
[1:38:27] that was foreign for that day
[1:38:30] amen
[1:38:31] and when he speak the words
[1:38:34] many young men had read the scroll and
[1:38:36] sabbath mornings oh yeah but they look

[1:43:05] of reverend keep walking
[1:43:07] keep walking in the light of god that
[1:43:09] you've received
[1:43:10] because let me tell you it's going to
[1:43:12] take a radical turn
[1:43:14] the direction that you're going in to
[1:43:17] get us out of this pistols that we're
[1:43:18] living in
[1:43:20] you know

[1:43:43] if it's on your heart people say well if
[1:43:46] i ask them that they're gonna think that
[1:43:48] i'm not with them
[1:43:52] no
[1:43:54] but a question
[1:43:56] because somebody asks a question
[1:43:58] we have more light on the word of god
[1:44:01] and that life that we have on the world
[1:44:04] is changing our bodies right now
[1:44:06] are you here with me
[1:44:08] amen
[1:44:10] questions can be disruptive
[1:44:12] but questions can be true
[1:44:15] i told the church last week i said
[1:44:18] you know your wives that got the
[1:44:19] husbands that got up with it seemed like
[1:44:21] they've got the devil all over them and
[1:44:23] they begin to ramp and rage and shout in
[1:44:25] the house you said you just simply
[1:44:27] asking a question did you pray this
[1:44:29] morning
[1:44:31] it's a good question
[1:44:32] yeah but you better know who your
[1:44:35] husband is before you ask him that
[1:44:36] question
[1:44:42] after if he's a true christian
[1:44:44] it will come
[1:44:45] will calm him down amen
[1:44:48] praise god but we're here because we
[1:44:50] want to ruin the lord amen
[1:44:52] we're working on that change right and
[1:44:55] brethren i'll tell you we're not afraid
[1:44:57] of any challenge right because it's all
[1:45:00] of that challenge that god hope himself
[1:45:02] to us and reveal our position all right
[1:45:05] in the word of god may we buy our heads
[1:45:07] everywhere
[1:45:12] hallelujah
[1:45:16] i know many would like to be remembered
[1:45:17] this morning
[1:45:21] lord remember me lord
[1:45:26] lord for the questions of our heart this
[1:45:28] morning
[1:45:34] lord maybe there's somebody here this
[1:45:35] morning that has
[1:45:36] pondered for years
[1:45:39] something or god they don't understand
[1:45:42] in their own lives
[1:45:44] the law that spirit affair
[1:45:47] has caused them god
[1:45:50] not to say
[1:45:52] for the releasing of god by the power of
[1:45:55] almighty god
[1:45:58] lord jesus
[1:46:00] might be the change of our bodies
[1:46:03] he's in our mouth to this morning
[1:46:06] the lord jesus as we look at these
[1:46:09] lord we see john coming on the scene he
[1:46:11] didn't come for popularity
[1:46:13] because lord what he said would push all
[1:46:15] men from him
[1:46:17] the lord god there was something that
[1:46:19] you gave him
[1:46:21] and there's something you have given us
[1:46:22] this morning
[1:46:24] heavenly father we pray that oh god
[1:46:26] somebody would come to that position of
[1:46:28] god
[1:46:30] to realize that lord god we've been
[1:46:32] pressing in the right direction
[1:46:34] but lord god there's still more that
[1:46:37] that's got to come out
[1:46:40] because lord god
[1:46:42] we still
[1:46:43] can't see god
[1:46:45] how you bring the healing of our bodies
[1:46:48] but yet lord god we're looking for an
[1:46:50] eternal healing of our bodies that we
[1:46:52] will seek no more
[1:46:55] the lord god there is some that's got to
[1:46:57] go by the grave but lord god the fear of
[1:47:00] death is still holding
[1:47:02] and lord god what will we do
[1:47:05] until oh god that fear has been rolled
[1:47:07] away
[1:47:10] lord god we believe that revelation will
[1:47:12] clarify
[1:47:14] our misunderstandings
[1:47:16] so lord god give us that spirit
[1:47:19] who got to listen
[1:47:21] and to seek after
[1:47:23] and to search
[1:47:25] lord like you tell them go read the
[1:47:27] scriptures for in them you say that
[1:47:30] you've got eternal life and these are
[1:47:31] they that testify of me
[1:47:34] oh god we pray that there's something
[1:47:36] this morning that was said
[1:47:38] that would challenge our hearts
[1:47:40] to get back to the world that which
[1:47:42] we've already seen and that which we
[1:47:44] have already said
[1:47:46] that oh god that which you want to say
[1:47:48] you might stay within us
[1:47:50] bless us god remember the sick of the
[1:47:52] afflicted the don't cast the lord god
[1:47:55] and in this in the midst of this
[1:47:57] troubled time lord god those who've lost
[1:48:00] oh god the joy of their experience the
[1:48:03] lord god your spirit will be with your
[1:48:05] children as we walk on into this
[1:48:08] metamorphosis
[1:48:10] bless us god as we thank you for
[1:48:12] everything and believe you in jesus name
[1:48:14] we pray
[1:48:15] amen amen
[1:48:30] musicians would you come
[1:48:34] i was thinking
[1:48:35] while he was preaching on it and that
[1:48:37] thought come in my mind
[1:48:39] you know a question
[1:48:42] that always has
[1:48:44] one of two reactions
[1:48:47] and you can call them chemical reactions
[1:48:48] or whatever you're gonna call them but
[1:48:49] it causes a reaction in your body
[1:48:53] it's either the fact that you become
[1:48:56] conscious that something you need to
[1:48:58] work on or do as the brother would say
[1:49:00] and that would bring a tearful
[1:49:03] attitude with him our questions will
[1:49:05] bring a snicker in your heart to say
[1:49:09] i already know that
[1:49:13] so questions and things will always
[1:49:16] do one of the two things
[1:49:18] which one does it does i don't really
[1:49:20] know that see that's a reaction in your
[1:49:22] body
[1:49:24] do we need to work on it right enjoy the
[1:49:26] message amen
[1:49:34] 5 30
[1:49:36] 5 39 anybody have a need
[1:50:02] me
[1:50:20] away from
[1:50:29] holy spirit
[1:50:49] me
[1:51:01] among you
[1:51:03] later
[1:51:17] don't worry about it the holy spirit
[1:51:18] will always keep your transition
[1:51:21] straight
[1:51:22] it may take a while yeah
[1:51:25] but it will bring you to the straight
[1:51:29] point away
[1:52:01] you know a question come one time in
[1:52:03] heaven when sin had entered the picture
[1:52:05] and said we'll go
[1:52:08] well you know what it caused someone
[1:52:10] to come
[1:52:12] the question
[1:52:14] or someone to come right don't never
[1:52:16] worry about a question
[1:52:18] because
[1:52:20] i never claim to have all the answers

[1:52:25] but i claim to know one
[1:52:28] who has all the answers yeah
[1:52:31] that's the point you remember my story
[1:52:33] it's not a person that studied that
[1:52:35] knows everything because you get all
[1:52:37] messed up
[1:52:38] it's a person that knows who to go to
[1:52:42] to get the answer to that question
