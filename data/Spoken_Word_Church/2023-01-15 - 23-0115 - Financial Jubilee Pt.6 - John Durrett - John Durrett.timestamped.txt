[0:00] to stand behind this desk Lord Jesus and
[0:02] just present this Sunday school lesson I
[0:04] pray you touch every heart Lord just
[0:06] bless your children Lord Jesus as we we
[0:08] learn about you father God and bless
[0:10] this whole day Lord the services Lord
[0:12] May our hearts be prepared Lord to
[0:13] worship you to hear from Heaven Lord
[0:15] Jesus we thank you Lord for this
[0:18] opportunity Lord bless our brothers Lord
[0:20] just around the world Lord traveling and
[0:22] I was on a mission trip and bless us now
[0:24] father we committed in your hands in
[0:25] Jesus Christ's name amen amen praise the
[0:29] Lord so Financial Jubilee fighting to
[0:31] believe
[0:32] part six
[0:34] and um definitely you know this is um
[0:37] certainly a a fight you know we started
[0:40] last time and it's all about fighting to
[0:42] believe
[0:44] in Jubilee as we know that word is about
[0:46] freedom and although we say Financial
[0:48] Jubilee I hope by now you're seeing that
[0:50] we're really talking about the freedom
[0:52] that Christ gives all of us you know to
[0:54] make us whole to to Deliver Us from any
[0:57] type of bondage that we are in we go to
[1:00] the next slide with my brothers
[1:02] and Jubilee I love this quote says no
[1:05] matter how long they had been in bondage
[1:07] or how long they were supposed to stay
[1:09] there when the year come of Jubilee when
[1:12] the trumpet sounded every man could go
[1:14] free if he wanted to go free and I just
[1:18] love that if you take a minute just to
[1:20] look at those words you know no matter
[1:21] how long you've been in bondage so if we
[1:23] just use Financial Jubilee as just a a
[1:25] map it's a symbol it's just something
[1:27] small that we all can relate to as we
[1:30] work we earn money we get new jobs we
[1:33] save we buy we spin just something small
[1:36] that we can hold on to that we all can
[1:37] relate to as we look at these greater
[1:40] promises that God has for us and so no
[1:43] no matter how long we've been how long
[1:45] we've handled money I mean some of it is
[1:46] generational for me it was generational
[1:49] from history and history and history
[1:51] that I grew up not knowing any clue how
[1:54] to handle any type of money all we knew
[1:56] you get money we buy candy that's what
[1:57] we started out with that's all we had to
[2:00] ask my dad for a dime and a penny I knew
[2:02] you needed a penny for tax and that was
[2:04] about it we could buy a diamond worth of
[2:05] candy
[2:06] and that's pretty much how my journey
[2:08] with money started
[2:10] and it no matter how long you were
[2:11] supposed to be there how long you were
[2:13] supposed to stay that way as I got older
[2:15] and and finally got my my mortgage and
[2:17] man I thought I was living it up you
[2:19] know I took every dime and I tried to
[2:21] get the biggest house that we could
[2:23] possibly get this was in Maryland
[2:25] and to the Max and they they had you
[2:28] know of course 10-year loan 15-year
[2:30] loans 30-year loans were the normal I
[2:32] got me a 40-year loan and I thought I
[2:34] was my goodness and was thinking about
[2:37] the Next Generation loans you can pass
[2:38] it to your kids after you leave but
[2:40] thank God we stopped at 40.
[2:43] but praise the Lord when I when the
[2:45] trumpet sounded that stopped me in my
[2:48] track I asked the Lord what happened and
[2:50] he started revealing to me all about
[2:52] this Jubilee so every man could go free
[2:55] if he wanted to go free
[2:59] by the grace of the Lord Jesus go to the
[3:01] next slide
[3:02] so it's cleaning up our lives you know
[3:05] as we look at our prophet and what he
[3:06] says pay your debts oh no man get all
[3:09] things off your hands get everything
[3:12] right Make Ready Get Ready remember in
[3:15] the name of the Lord something is fixing
[3:18] to happen amen so it's about cleaning up
[3:20] our lives getting ourselves ready
[3:23] and remember it's a fight it's a fight
[3:25] that we're trying to win it we're trying
[3:27] to win at something go to the next slide
[3:29] brothers and I brought this out last
[3:31] time
[3:32] and it says that's the way it is with
[3:34] human life you can't play the rules of
[3:36] the game of Life wrong and expect to win
[3:38] so I hope we're all here trying to win
[3:41] we're trying to win something I know by
[3:43] the grace of Lord I'm trying to win I'm
[3:45] trying to win something you know whether
[3:47] you're playing sports or anything in
[3:49] this life Journey it's about winning so
[3:51] I love this quote because if we can
[3:52] relate we're trying to win we're trying
[3:54] to win with our families we're trying to
[3:55] win in our marriages we're trying to win
[3:57] in our homes we want to do things right
[4:00] any any young couple young person
[4:02] starting out I mean you thinking about
[4:04] marrying Prince Charming and Princess
[4:07] charming and oh life is going to be at
[4:10] ease you're going to get the job oh it's
[4:12] going to be perfect
[4:13] but somehow along the journey you
[4:16] realize oh my I need some help but by
[4:20] the grace of the lord we have the word
[4:21] of God that gives us the rules to play
[4:24] by and if we expect to win we got to
[4:27] play according to the rules the rule
[4:29] book has been here my brothers and
[4:31] sisters it's been here all of our Lives
[4:33] since we all were born that word of God
[4:35] has been there and many of us with the
[4:38] prophet of God since we were here I was
[4:39] born in 1978 Prophet was well off the
[4:43] scene all the tapes were recorded at
[4:45] that time
[4:46] and the same word
[4:48] now there's so many people that doesn't
[4:51] seem to have any kind of purpose in life
[4:52] especially in the day that we now live
[4:55] people just seem to think that all they
[4:58] have to do is keep up with someone else
[4:59] with the Fashions of this world with the
[5:01] enticements of this world
[5:02] and with the enticements that the world
[5:04] has given to them
[5:06] that's right and and we just you know we
[5:08] set our bar to what everybody else is
[5:09] doing
[5:10] you know and there's another quote I
[5:12] won't bring won't be printing on the
[5:14] screen but brother said it's so many
[5:15] different angles and it's so many
[5:17] different angles in this day and time
[5:18] that he said we hardly know what to do
[5:21] you know you got so many voices so many
[5:24] screenshots so many oh it you we need
[5:27] God's word and we have to fight to hold
[5:30] on what is right
[5:32] by the grace of the lord we came across
[5:34] a testimony brother Joe shared it and I
[5:36] thought I would bring it up and just
[5:39] read it out brother Terry Tidwell we can
[5:41] bring to the next screen just a
[5:42] wonderful testimony but I want to bring
[5:44] into context what are we fighting for
[5:46] what are we fighting for in this
[5:48] testimony as I thought about financial
[5:50] Jubilee it just kind of brought me to
[5:52] some thoughts but I want to just
[5:53] actually read the the testimony for you
[5:58] and so I don't know these are small
[5:59] prints so you don't have to try to read
[6:01] it but I'll read it it says as many of
[6:03] you know this is Brother Terry Tidwell
[6:04] he said I was the youngest of six kids I
[6:07] was told I just kind of slipped in there
[6:09] my parents were not planning to have any
[6:11] more kids after the five they had but I
[6:14] had to be born we lived in this house
[6:16] near Franklin Tennessee we had no
[6:18] running water no phone no Plumbing my
[6:21] dad worked and preached trying to keep
[6:22] food on our table while also trying to
[6:25] feed the loss it was a rainy afternoon I
[6:27] was four or five and the oldest was
[6:29] around 10 and being stuck inside we were
[6:32] all getting on Mom's nerves with only
[6:35] two rooms of playing mom suggested that
[6:37] we get down on our knees and pray that
[6:39] the Lord would send my brother and
[6:41] sister a pair of shoes since they didn't
[6:43] have any for church the next day
[6:46] what started as a sweet gesture was a
[6:48] defining moment in my life together in
[6:51] the living room all six of us kids
[6:53] huddled together to pray that the Lord
[6:55] would send shoes for my brother and
[6:57] sister so they could go to church the
[6:59] next morning
[7:00] it was late in the afternoon on that
[7:02] long summer day when a car came slowly
[7:04] rolling down our country road a knock at
[7:07] the door revealed brother and sister
[7:09] Gibson who lived 40 miles away standing
[7:12] there with bags in their hands Brother
[7:14] Gibson in his quiet manner explained to
[7:16] Mama that while he was praying today the
[7:19] Holy Ghost spoke to him and said go buy
[7:22] shoes for your children
[7:24] as six Small Faces were fastened upon
[7:26] the preacher Mama began to cry out of
[7:29] those bags came not just two but six
[7:31] little boxes of brand new shoes
[7:33] for months afterwards mama would pray
[7:36] over and polish all six pair of shoes on
[7:39] Saturday night before church on Sunday
[7:41] thanking God for answering prayer praise
[7:46] the Lord what a testimony my goodness um
[7:50] by the grace of the Lord
[7:52] so when you look at that and I just want
[7:55] to update this not change the testimony
[7:58] but I want to tell you what we deal with
[8:00] and certainly for the modern generation
[8:03] flip the next slide
[8:06] bring up ads for Kohl's
[8:09] so if we look at that testimony what's
[8:11] happening now
[8:13] it would be a little different
[8:16] mama would probably be worried about the
[8:18] kids needing shoes
[8:20] Kohl's ad would show up
[8:22] 30 off with a credit card
[8:25] mom would be like okay I'm gonna go down
[8:28] and get some pair of shoes
[8:30] she would go get the shoes on credit get
[8:32] her 30 off
[8:34] but they needed a coat also
[8:36] so she would go and get some coats for
[8:38] him as well putting on credits only five
[8:40] more dollars a month what's the big deal
[8:43] she also needed a pair of shoes too
[8:45] so she got her three pair of shoes
[8:48] and she liked that bracelet as well
[8:51] because she deserved it you know she'd
[8:52] been working hard and she might as well
[8:54] get her husband a gift too while she's
[8:56] at it that's going to go up to eight
[8:58] dollars more a month
[8:59] hey let's go and do it but his birthday
[9:02] is coming up as well so she's gonna go
[9:03] and get his birthday present on credit
[9:05] also that's only 13 more dollars a month
[9:09] and she's going to take it all home
[9:12] when Jimmy sees the shoes he didn't want
[9:14] those pair of shoes because he wanted
[9:16] some Nikes he didn't want Adidas
[9:18] so now he breaks down into a tantrum and
[9:21] he's crying she's upset
[9:23] dad gets home it's like man why you buy
[9:26] all this stuff
[9:27] well it's only 18 a month why are you
[9:30] complaining and I got your gift but now
[9:33] he's depressed he's sad because she's
[9:35] spent too much money that he didn't have
[9:37] and there you go now they're arguing
[9:40] they're mad with all this stuff on the
[9:42] desert all the stuff on the table
[9:44] and nothing has been learned they have
[9:47] been cursed by what should have been a
[9:49] blessing and they never got an
[9:50] opportunity to see what God can do
[9:53] yeah that's what the devil is trying to
[9:54] do to us it's all a gimmick you heard
[9:57] the quote brother Brent I'm talking
[9:58] about cigarettes saying it's all a
[10:00] gimmick well it's the same thing that's
[10:03] what the devil is trying to do he's
[10:04] trying to weaken our faith so we can
[10:07] never obtain to what God wants for us we
[10:10] don't know how to depend on him we don't
[10:11] know how to ask for him we don't know
[10:14] how to wait for him and that's what it's
[10:16] all about him Satan can get in there and
[10:18] Miss mess us up
[10:20] regardless of where you are in your life
[10:22] then he knows he can have that pattern
[10:24] for the rest of your life and the last
[10:26] thing you're doing is trying to wait on
[10:28] God when you have all access to
[10:31] everything you need we don't wait on the
[10:33] Lord we just go out and we do and this
[10:36] is what God is trying to help us to slow
[10:37] down to back up to learn his principles
[10:40] and standards so we can get to the true
[10:43] true Riches of God
[10:46] go to the next slide as we've talked
[10:48] about the principles and I'm just going
[10:50] to run through these These are the
[10:51] principles that we should be thinking
[10:53] about on a day-to-day basis God owns
[10:55] everything he's our father we are the
[10:58] bride of Christ or we should be so we
[11:01] should be waiting on our husband who
[11:02] already promises that he can supply all
[11:05] of our needs he has promised that we
[11:07] have it in the word he owns it all but
[11:10] we have to manage what he gives us very
[11:12] diligently remember money costs your
[11:15] time I don't care if you're borrowing it
[11:16] I don't care what it is something has to
[11:18] pay for that and the only thing that's
[11:19] going to pay for that is your time your
[11:21] life
[11:22] we have to be patient we have to avoid
[11:25] debt like a curse we have to save we
[11:28] have to watch the ants learn from them
[11:30] and remember the best investment is
[11:32] giving but we need to be in a position
[11:33] where we can give freely and remember
[11:36] godliness with contentment is a great
[11:39] gain great gain and that's the desire
[11:42] that we're after we're after that that
[11:43] great game
[11:45] so we're talking about how to fight
[11:49] and and fighting again remember God has
[11:52] these promises for us financially within
[11:54] our marriage within our every he has all
[11:56] of the examples for us but we have to
[11:59] fight the next slide he says now the
[12:01] people today are expecting expecting
[12:04] sorry now remember God gave them the
[12:07] land down in Egypt said the land is
[12:09] yours every bit of it now the people
[12:10] today are expecting God to reach down
[12:13] get them by the neck say yes that's
[12:14] right you bring me out clean me off heal
[12:17] me and I'll believe you God doesn't do
[12:18] his business that way he gives you the
[12:21] promise remember we have that word we
[12:22] have the promises but you have to go
[12:25] fight for every inch of ground that
[12:28] you have to fight for every inch of
[12:30] ground that you possess
[12:32] and we always know this is scripture
[12:34] that is very well known here II Peter 1
[12:36] 4 whereby are given unto exceeding great
[12:40] and precious promises that by these you
[12:43] might be partakers of the divine nature
[12:44] having escaped the corruption that is in
[12:46] the world through lust so we have all
[12:48] these promises and Israel is a great
[12:50] example for us to see God made the
[12:54] promise but you have to fight for it so
[12:56] everything I've been talking about just
[12:57] Financial Jubilee it's something you're
[12:59] going to have to fight for but it's
[13:01] yours all of these promises that we hear
[13:04] they're ours but we're going to have to
[13:06] fight for it we can't expect it to be
[13:09] delivered to us and I know brother Dale
[13:11] always brings out and he said for a long
[13:13] time you know many in this message are
[13:15] not going to make the Rapture and that's
[13:17] sad because we're expecting that it's
[13:19] just going to be given
[13:21] instead of fighting for this fighting
[13:24] for the promises God called us to be
[13:26] examples that's what he did for Israel
[13:28] they were just to be an example so other
[13:31] nations could see a nation that could
[13:33] follow God it had nothing to do with
[13:36] whether they're going to be rich poor
[13:38] David Solomon they had great riches
[13:42] but he was looking for a nation that
[13:44] could be example in everything he wanted
[13:46] them to be the head not the tale
[13:49] he's made it very clear they would be
[13:51] the ones lending to Nations not the one
[13:54] borrowing so how much more of an example
[13:57] God wants for us in this last day the
[14:00] end time we're at the end of the whole
[14:03] game but we know how to win we know what
[14:06] we should be winning
[14:08] we know but we're expecting it different
[14:11] why because the devil has gimmicks he
[14:14] has all of these gimmicks for us go to
[14:17] the next slide
[14:19] and this this quote just my goodness
[14:22] this this just almost blew me away you
[14:24] know as I was looking at this yesterday
[14:26] he said now remember God gave them the
[14:28] land down in Egypt that land is yours
[14:31] every bit of it now the people today are
[14:34] expecting I'm sorry did I go to that
[14:36] to the next one he said
[14:39] if you've got a shadow of a power of God
[14:43] in you you got power to do it God is
[14:46] omnipotent see what I mean the power
[14:49] that's in you will make you could speak
[14:52] a world into existence and go live on it
[14:55] Hallelujah there you are my goodness do
[15:00] we believe that
[15:01] I mean do we really believe we could
[15:03] actually go speak a world with ocean
[15:06] land Seas into existence and go live on
[15:10] it well I do I believe we do but I don't
[15:14] believe it's going to be something we're
[15:15] going to just going to show up one
[15:16] morning and you're going to have that
[15:17] kind of power no no no no if we can't
[15:21] save 500 for an emergency fund then I
[15:24] think we need to back up a little bit
[15:26] make sure we can start creating
[15:28] something
[15:29] where we can see God move where we can
[15:32] have testimonies of God moving in every
[15:34] area of our life to get to where we can
[15:37] step into this kind of power where we
[15:39] can raise the dead we can get people out
[15:43] of the graves for a resurrection that
[15:45] we've heard so much about
[15:48] but brothers and sisters I don't believe
[15:49] it's just going to show up one morning
[15:51] and we don't have the character to do it
[15:54] so God is trying to get us to that point
[15:56] where we have something we can continue
[15:58] to step one step at a time to reach this
[16:02] kind of power yes this is not just a
[16:05] myth he's saying with the Holy Spirit we
[16:08] have that kind of power that's what
[16:10] power is in the church now but it's
[16:12] controlled by a law it's a law of Faith
[16:14] Jesus said all things are possible to
[16:18] them that believe if you can believe it
[16:20] whatever God will lead your soul to
[16:22] believe that is yours every place The
[16:26] Souls of your foot can set up on now
[16:30] notice that you can set upon if you
[16:33] can't set there to create a world it's
[16:35] not going to happen
[16:37] if we can't set to save for an emergency
[16:40] fund if we can't set our foot to
[16:42] I can buy a car with cash
[16:46] brothers and sisters were falling for
[16:49] the gimmicks we're falling for the
[16:50] tricks
[16:51] because you get a character as you build
[16:53] as you save as you wait on the Lord you
[16:56] get to see him just as brother Terry
[16:58] Tidwell brought out it was a defining
[17:00] moment in his life to see God answer
[17:02] that prayer that set a foundation of
[17:06] faith in a young boy
[17:07] and the same thing we should be able to
[17:09] do by the grace of the Lord set examples
[17:13] for our children for our families for
[17:15] our friend for our co-workers for
[17:17] everything that we do but this is not
[17:19] easy
[17:20] it's not it is a fight
[17:24] and if we can just do Little Things by
[17:27] the grace of the Lord knowing what is
[17:29] the prize knowing every day brother Wade
[17:32] and brother Dale and the brothers just
[17:34] sacrifice and bringing us this these
[17:36] promises they're bringing us the
[17:38] promises 50 years if we know brother
[17:40] they're bringing these promises
[17:43] but oh God we have to be able to step
[17:45] into it can we rise to the faith or are
[17:47] we just hearing things
[17:48] so that's what the journey is if we
[17:50] could take a small thing I don't matter
[17:52] how young you are where you are on your
[17:54] journey if you can start saving a little
[17:55] bit to say Lord I'm gonna have to wait
[17:57] on you I'm going to have to sacrifice
[17:59] Lord and wait I know I want it and I see
[18:01] a way I can get it my way or the way the
[18:03] world tells me through this gimmick but
[18:05] Lord God let me hold on just for a
[18:08] little longer father I do need this Lord
[18:10] but I don't have the money to do it I
[18:12] don't have the money to do it so Lord
[18:15] God I'm gonna need you to supply
[18:18] okay because when he does give you the
[18:20] money he still needs you to wait on him
[18:22] we just can't do whatever we want to
[18:24] because it's all his
[18:25] and that becomes a difficult
[18:27] responsibility when you have children
[18:29] you got family and he's like Lord what
[18:31] would you want me to do I can do this
[18:33] father but I want to be led by you
[18:37] but I want to be in a position Lord or
[18:39] if you speak to me like Brother Gibson
[18:40] says go buy those kids shoes you're in a
[18:43] position he doesn't break out his credit
[18:45] card and says Ah I'm gonna get them
[18:47] shoes and a coat too no no no no no
[18:51] God supplies God works on all Avenue
[18:54] he says if you are a son of God you are
[18:57] a daughter of God that never leaves you
[18:59] that power it's with you all the time
[19:01] but he says your faith gets away from it
[19:06] but it's still there
[19:09] so my what power do we have with this
[19:12] word of God in the end of the end times
[19:15] we are here with such power such
[19:18] promises
[19:20] but we're gonna have to fight my
[19:22] brothers and sisters fight let's go to
[19:23] the next slide fight fight fight
[19:27] but Moses Joshua and the Israelites had
[19:29] to fight for every inch and every
[19:31] promise in the book is yours but God
[19:32] will never give it to you
[19:35] and you lay back on a bed of ease that's
[19:38] just brother brim this is his quote
[19:40] he'll never give it to you you'll fight
[19:42] for every inch you get that's it fight
[19:45] for every inch
[19:47] things are handed to you that's what the
[19:50] matter with the American people tonight
[19:51] you've got everything handed to you well
[19:54] fed fattened and clothed and everything
[19:57] so you think the devil doesn't know that
[20:00] you don't think he has set this thing up
[20:03] he's designed this thing it is the most
[20:07] fantastic marketing scheme in the end
[20:11] time that we're facing right now
[20:14] internet the devil he has it for free
[20:18] oh we are influencing one another
[20:21] we are just all in
[20:25] trying to keep up with everybody else
[20:30] the devil has this design because he
[20:32] knows if we can get to where things are
[20:34] handed to us
[20:35] we don't know how to fight and he know
[20:37] we will never even get close to these
[20:39] promises that God has promised for us
[20:42] go to the next slide as we're kind of
[20:44] winding up
[20:46] and and this is what ended up you ended
[20:48] up with people that was holding on to
[20:49] God's promised hand and those who
[20:51] couldn't even get close you had Caleb
[20:53] he's still the people he said let us go
[20:55] up at once and possess it for we are
[20:57] well able well able to do it but the men
[21:00] that went up with him said we be not
[21:02] able to go up against his people for
[21:04] they are stronger than we so that's what
[21:06] we're talking about that's where we're
[21:06] in as our faith gets weakened and we
[21:08] can't get to these promises we're
[21:10] hearing these things
[21:11] if we don't have that those patterns we
[21:14] don't have the the strength we haven't
[21:16] built up you can't run a marathon my
[21:18] brothers and sisters I know I couldn't
[21:21] unless I practice you know so this is
[21:24] greater than a marathon
[21:26] so there's no way unless we practice
[21:28] every single day every single hour
[21:31] everything that we're doing asking God
[21:33] to be with us and guide us on this
[21:35] journey
[21:37] amen so we can get to where these
[21:39] promises as they become more of a
[21:40] reality in our lives we're not like the
[21:43] other ten that said we're not able to go
[21:46] up we know we're able to go up because
[21:49] we've seen him move we had so many areas
[21:51] in our life so many testimonies just
[21:53] stacked upon one another in our own life
[21:56] our own experience that we're like no
[21:59] same God that I serve he can do this the
[22:03] same God that I know he can do this
[22:04] let's go to the next slide let's go
[22:06] we'll skip to the next one after this
[22:08] keep going
[22:10] so we have to put on the whole armor of
[22:12] God that we can stand against The Wiles
[22:14] of the devil we have to have the whole
[22:17] armor of God and that's why we're here
[22:19] today to get equipped to hear the word
[22:21] to get the whole armor of God and our
[22:23] mental mind and our physical strength in
[22:26] our decisions to wait on God to be
[22:28] courageous to be strong all those things
[22:30] promised in Joshua we got to be strong
[22:33] we got to wait on the Lord all those
[22:34] kind of things and we got to have this
[22:36] full armor of God every day
[22:40] so we can stand against the Wilds of the
[22:42] devil I just want to bring out one of
[22:43] the Wiles of the devil because I've been
[22:44] spending some time in
[22:47] Moses with Moses and the children of
[22:48] Israel and Balaam let's go to the next
[22:50] slide
[22:51] you know Balaam he tried his best to
[22:53] curse the the children of Israel he
[22:55] couldn't do it he finally
[22:57] realized he couldn't do it
[22:59] the scripture ended up saying for they
[23:01] vexed you with when God told Moses
[23:03] finally to go down there and wipe out
[23:04] the midianites he says for they have
[23:07] vexed you with their vows wherewith they
[23:09] have beguiled you in the matter of pure
[23:11] that's what God finally told Moses go
[23:13] down and wipe them out because they have
[23:14] Vex you with their Wiles with their
[23:16] gimmicks with their tricks what was this
[23:18] trick what was this trick that they
[23:19] ended up pulling off he could not bail
[23:22] him couldn't curse him
[23:23] so what he came up with was hey we're
[23:25] just gonna have a big party and invite
[23:27] him to a party that was the gimmick
[23:29] brother Riddim said they got up there
[23:31] they started seeing all of these fancy
[23:34] things all of these women half naked
[23:38] and it was like wow wow
[23:42] and they compromised they compromised
[23:45] and that's how they end up falling
[23:47] couldn't curse them they end up cursing
[23:49] themselves so Satan knows he can't get
[23:52] get us with all of these different
[23:53] things that you know we've gotten away
[23:55] from in the world many of us drinking
[23:57] smoking all those kind of things but uh
[23:59] if he can get us with those gimmicks
[24:01] just go to way of the world don't wait
[24:03] on the Lord find a way there's an easier
[24:05] way there's a we don't have to wait on
[24:07] anything it's free just figure out
[24:09] something the way the world has it
[24:10] designed we will never see God move in
[24:13] our life
[24:14] but we will have what we think we needed
[24:16] we will have these things but not
[24:18] realizing that our faith has been
[24:20] weakened we're just listening to things
[24:22] that we don't even believe is possible
[24:25] when God wants to show us there is
[24:28] nothing nothing impossible for God
[24:31] you know the world is full of all these
[24:33] advertisements that has this little ad
[24:34] with this little girl that says using
[24:36] your first credit card wisely
[24:39] she's probably about 10 years old
[24:40] promise you if she was why she wouldn't
[24:42] have that no
[24:44] and I got this other little thing that
[24:46] was pretty funny to me said I'm A Jones
[24:47] try to keep up
[24:49] that social media world you're seeing
[24:51] all the Jones everybody I'm a Jones keep
[24:53] up with me keep up with me and we're
[24:56] striving we're fighting going the way of
[24:58] the world versus fighting to wait on God
[25:00] to have him move so we can get to this
[25:02] freedom because remember Jubilee we're
[25:05] saying Financial Jubilee but I hope by
[25:07] now you're realizing this God just
[25:09] really saying hey it's time for us time
[25:11] for us to be free in Christ free from
[25:14] Indie bondage oh it's Grace and his
[25:16] freedom and that's the wonderful thing
[25:18] about God that's what I've I have
[25:20] experienced is Grace and his freedom
[25:22] regardless of the mistakes regardless of
[25:24] all of that no matter how long we've
[25:26] been nor how long we're supposed to be
[25:28] God can make us free so I pray God bless
[25:31] you I pray you hold on to these things
[25:33] let's fight for our freedom in Christ
[25:35] amen so we can truly truly get to all
[25:38] these precious promises certainly see
[25:40] all the young couples and the couples
[25:41] starting out hey fight fight now fight
[25:45] now I promise you if you talk to any
[25:47] couple older they would say fight fight
[25:50] and when you're young or fight for your
[25:51] marriage fight for your finances fight
[25:53] to be that example God has given you so
[25:55] much potential by the grace of the Lord
[25:57] to be in this word all of us we have so
[26:00] much potential and I pray God will
[26:02] continue to bless us all the musicians
[26:03] can come on up God bless
