[29:26] was having you to turn around and sing
[29:29] you appreciate that for the the
[29:31] confidence in the the person to bring
[29:34] the word but there always the one going
[29:36] this way that's going to take care of us
[29:38] one back here behind us that's where the
[29:40] pictures are at what we believe the Lord
[29:43] Jesus look like he'll take care of us
[29:45] right Hebrews 6 and Revelations 1 father
[29:48] we thank you we love you Lord for all of
[29:51] the things that you've given unto us
[29:53] thank you most of all for your word that
[29:56] you've allowed us to be able to receive
[30:00] we ask you tonight that you'd just come
[30:02] and dwell in us and with us Lord and
[30:05] just open our eyes that we may see cuz
[30:08] we know who we're looking for and what
[30:10] we're looking at you know because we're
[30:13] looking to you we know you'll take care
[30:16] of it have your way bless the sick you
[30:19] said in your word you sent your word and
[30:22] healed us and delivered us from
[30:23] destruction so Just Have Your Way guide
[30:26] each one in Jesus name amen Hebrews
[30:31] 6 we've been reading 1 through
[30:35] 3 therefore leaving the principles of
[30:38] the doctrine of Christ let us go on to
[30:40] Perfection not laying again the
[30:42] foundation of repentance from dead works
[30:45] and of Faith toward god of the doctrine
[30:48] of baptisms and of laying on of hands
[30:50] and of resurrection of the dead and of
[30:52] Eternal
[30:54] judgment this will we do if God permit
[30:58] see as we always say that he never
[31:00] permitted Paul to go on to the change of
[31:02] the body but he's permitted and I
[31:05] believe here in the end time because I
[31:07] believe we're right here at that point
[31:09] don't you okay Revelations
[31:12] 1 the revelation of Jesus Christ which
[31:15] God gave unto him to show unto his
[31:17] servants things which must shortly come
[31:19] to pass and he sent and signified it by
[31:22] his Angel unto his servant John who bear
[31:26] witness of the word of God and of the
[31:28] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[31:30] things that he saw blessed is he that
[31:33] readeth and they that hear the words of
[31:36] this prophecy and keep those things
[31:38] which are written therein for the time
[31:41] is at hand now jump over to verse 10
[31:44] we'll try to get to here I was in the
[31:47] spirit on the Lord's day and heard
[31:49] behind me a great voice as of a trumpet
[31:52] so you may be seated Lord at his
[31:54] Blessing to the reading of the word
[32:00] now we've been on
[32:02] this this is message number three
[32:05] specifically dealing with the Book of
[32:08] Revelations and U you know I just want
[32:11] to make sure that we get it and get a
[32:14] correct understanding because you know
[32:17] this book has been called just about
[32:19] everything and Mankind has always tried
[32:22] to uh keep you from reading it and
[32:25] studying it and claiming that you
[32:27] couldn't understand it you know it was
[32:30] all like this that and the other but
[32:32] since the prophet came and gave us the
[32:35] message why can't we understand it I
[32:37] mean it was given through us I believe
[32:40] the reason that Satan wanted us to stay
[32:43] away from The Book of Revelations is the
[32:45] fact that the Book of Revelations is
[32:47] dealing exactly with the bride of Christ
[32:50] amen you know in the time on Earth and
[32:53] and what will happen and and showing us
[32:55] the the future and all all of the things
[32:58] but I want to just make sure we get it
[33:02] and get it in the correct order to
[33:06] understand you know because it says
[33:10] now the revelation of Jesus Christ which
[33:14] God gave unto
[33:16] him
[33:18] now we went through there and we've been
[33:20] in it and up and down and you know we
[33:22] had to kind of change a little bit and I
[33:24] hope that if you miss Sunday's message
[33:26] Sunday afternoon especially that you
[33:28] will go through it and listen to it
[33:31] because I was trying to
[33:32] explain uh basically how that God would
[33:36] limit himself in the bases that so you'd
[33:40] say well now look there that we don't
[33:41] believe in a trinity we read here the
[33:43] Revelation that that you know uh God
[33:47] gave to Jesus to give to John well that
[33:51] looks like it's got to be two or three
[33:53] people now brother Dale but no it's not
[33:56] it's the opening of the
[33:58] word revealing the word or in other
[34:02] words the time and the the opportunity
[34:05] to be able to receive and see God put a
[34:08] limit on the basis of himself to work
[34:11] that when he was in human flesh he would
[34:14] not even know when he would be coming
[34:16] cuz he said so right all right but the
[34:19] prophet of God said now this time on
[34:22] patmas see now he knows well that's what
[34:26] it is that's the Revelation that God
[34:29] give to Jesus right it's not a
[34:31] revelation of another God it's a
[34:33] revelation showing him of what he went
[34:36] through at
[34:38] Calvary and what going through at
[34:40] Calvary made a way that they could be a
[34:44] bride of
[34:45] Christ so that would be revealed to him
[34:48] now Jesus didn't know his own part in
[34:51] what he was doing right huh you read
[34:53] that you know if you want them I got
[34:55] them laying here but if you read the 12
[34:57] read page 12 13 14 of the church age
[35:01] Book You'll see the whole thing you know
[35:04] there in front of you that this book
[35:07] then what it it's the revelation of
[35:09] Jesus Christ which God gave unto
[35:13] him now I want you to
[35:16] notice the
[35:18] point of how God gave it to
[35:24] him he gave it to an angel
[35:29] and the angel give it to
[35:31] John because I mean you you you got to
[35:34] read it there cuz that's what it is see
[35:36] all right because it says in verse one
[35:37] of revelation God give to Jesus then
[35:40] when you come on over signified it by
[35:42] his
[35:43] Angel unto his servant
[35:46] John but now I want you to this may
[35:51] be five years from now I don't know
[35:54] something I'm thinking on but uh I want
[35:58] you to get in
[36:00] mind now I want you to think and get in
[36:04] mind that you'll see in the Book of
[36:08] Revelations that you'll see that there
[36:10] will be that John's receiving
[36:14] something and he will receive it from an
[36:18] angel right but then there's
[36:21] times that it will not be John receiving
[36:24] from an angel right
[36:28] it'll be times that Jesus is speaking
[36:31] personally to John but brother Brandon
[36:34] says that on uh the only book that that
[36:37] John where uh Revelation see the only
[36:40] book page 12 13 Church AG book the book
[36:44] is usually term the revelation of St
[36:46] John but that is incorrect it is the
[36:49] revelation of Jesus Christ given to John
[36:51] for Christians of all ages it is the
[36:53] only book in the entire Bible that is
[36:56] written by Jesus
[36:58] himself through personally appearing to
[37:02] a scribe right all right so now you're
[37:04] going to have to deal in the Book of
[37:06] Revelations with an
[37:09] angel all right then you're going to
[37:11] have to deal with the basis that it'll
[37:14] be Jesus
[37:17] personally all right so now put that in
[37:19] your mind because some of these days
[37:22] it'll be needful when we get over about
[37:24] Revelations uh 19 and
[37:27] on through there about some things it'll
[37:30] help you very much to see that God can
[37:34] deliver through an angel right
[37:38] right but then at times he appears
[37:40] himself right now the way I like it is a
[37:44] statement brother Bram made one
[37:47] time and he made it like this he said
[37:53] that the message of redemption was was
[37:56] so
[37:58] important that he couldn't trust it with
[38:01] an
[38:05] angel now the message of redemption
[38:08] that's right he's he couldn't trust it
[38:09] with an
[38:11] angel he didn't even trust it with a
[38:14] prophet right he came himself right
[38:18] right now that should be a note to write
[38:21] down in your mind to keep close
[38:24] attention to that God can use Angels yes
[38:29] right but God can also speak himself
[38:33] righten so the Plan of Redemption was so
[38:35] important he wouldn't trust it with a
[38:37] prophet to bring cuz see a prophet
[38:39] couldn't die to purchase that
[38:41] for but he still couldn't trust
[38:44] it he came himself amen now there's some
[38:48] more quotes on over well on over that we
[38:51] fit in with that and I believe will help
[38:53] us understand when we get there but the
[38:56] main thing I want you to look at tonight
[38:58] is one thing we'll get to it in a
[39:00] minute who is this book of Revelations
[39:03] written
[39:06] about the Book of Revelations according
[39:09] to what we've read it's the revelation
[39:12] of Jesus Christ right all
[39:15] right now there's a lot of things up and
[39:17] down and what's going on it and the
[39:19] tribulations been there and the
[39:21] destroying of Babylon the the doing and
[39:23] all that but in all of that you find the
[39:26] revelation of Jesus Christ right you
[39:28] know that's really the key of the entire
[39:31] Bible right sure the entire Bible is the
[39:35] revealing of one true and living
[39:38] God all right but now it
[39:42] takes the
[39:46] people are you listening it takes the
[39:49] people to make manifest that Revelation
[39:52] all
[39:53] right it takes people to live
[39:57] you know the Bible this Bible is you say
[40:00] that's that's revealing God but you know
[40:02] what it's talking about people right
[40:07] Moses Joshua y right we want to look at
[40:11] it a lot of times as you know to the
[40:14] point of just to try to see God and
[40:16] that's wonderful but just remember how
[40:19] God is revealing
[40:21] himself he uses man to reveal himself
[40:25] all right right
[40:27] but now
[40:29] listen this is not only the Revelation
[40:32] about Jesus
[40:34] Christ and something that he didn't even
[40:38] understand that's
[40:41] on page 14 Church AG book but it was a
[40:45] spiritual Kingdom that was going he was
[40:46] going to build even he could not tell
[40:49] them about his place in it for the
[40:52] father had not revealed it unto him but
[40:55] now after his death and resurrection and
[40:58] at this particular time in his
[41:01] mediatorial ministry he is able to set
[41:04] forth here in this revelation of himself
[41:06] to John what his glory and presence in
[41:10] the church would mean and do all right
[41:14] now you've heard me say it many
[41:18] times read the book of Revelations and
[41:21] find Jesus Christ revealed by
[41:25] himself
[41:26] it won't
[41:28] work you said well does that mean a lot
[41:30] to us brother Dale well I I love it
[41:33] because if I want to read my story I I
[41:36] want to read the story about me right
[41:39] now you know I mean now all the other
[41:43] things in the Bible was about
[41:46] somebody right right you know Paul Peter
[41:49] James John the early church and then
[41:52] we'll get into the church ages and we'll
[41:54] emphasize that the that in the church
[41:57] ages this is what happened back there
[41:59] but here's what's happening here
[42:03] now this is ours so this is my Bible
[42:07] right amen this is my book it's written
[42:11] to me that's what you must think about
[42:13] your
[42:14] Bible it's something written to you read
[42:17] it that way but you know what then
[42:19] you'll find out you get the Book of
[42:20] Revelation it's written about you right
[42:22] the Book of Revelation is written about
[42:24] you amen and and what's taking place he
[42:28] said well there's a lot about the devil
[42:29] there's a lot about the seals there's a
[42:31] lot about yeah but that's just the
[42:34] natural story right it's just like in
[42:37] the Book of Esther you know that in the
[42:40] Book of Esther the name God is not even
[42:42] mention that's right because it's a
[42:46] historical
[42:47] record showing the Purity and the
[42:51] wonderful things about the children of
[42:53] Israel
[42:55] right see because that was what it was
[42:57] for so we could call it that's really
[43:00] the Book of
[43:01] Esther cuz that's what it was about
[43:04] right well that's a way I want us to
[43:06] look at the Book of
[43:08] Revelations you want to have something
[43:09] to read go read the book of
[43:11] Revelations well I just can't understand
[43:14] that there's too many symbols there's
[43:16] too many well you're thinking the wrong
[43:18] way amen right listen to The Prophet
[43:23] listen to the
[43:25] scriptures as I said even God will tell
[43:29] you A lot of times what this means he
[43:31] gets over about Verse 18 19 20 and he
[43:34] tells you what the candlesticks are what
[43:38] the stars
[43:40] are so just you know let him answer your
[43:45] questions all right
[43:47] right but now take with
[43:52] me
[43:55] l
[43:56] we've come over to a place and we'll get
[43:58] to it in a minute if we have time to get
[44:00] there if we don't we'll stop take it
[44:02] another one
[44:03] s but it's a blessing according to verse
[44:07] three just to be able to read the book
[44:10] amen now what about all of it was taught
[44:13] don't you read
[44:15] it and the scripture said it's blessed
[44:18] is he that readeth and they that hear
[44:22] the words of this
[44:25] prophecy it's a blessing
[44:28] amen not a curse like people say don't
[44:30] read that now you get all messed up no
[44:34] it's like that man said that time don't
[44:36] read it to find out you're already
[44:38] messed
[44:39] up
[44:41] yeah that's the problem so you find out
[44:43] you're already messed up CU I like the
[44:46] the last part of the third verse where
[44:48] it
[44:49] says for the time is at
[44:52] hand now I believe it's time to for to
[44:55] have an understanding right you know I
[44:59] do I believe it's time to have an
[45:00] understanding you know that that the
[45:02] world has a lot of understanding of what
[45:05] we're talking
[45:06] about you know I mean that you turn the
[45:09] radio on and listen to the
[45:10] denominational preachers and sometimes
[45:13] they have a lot of
[45:14] understanding sometimes you wonder where
[45:16] they get it because you know where it's
[45:18] capable of getting it in things but
[45:21] still that's all right not you know not
[45:22] thr off on them just just just being the
[45:25] point
[45:26] to look at it like that all right now
[45:30] this is the Revelation then that God
[45:34] give to
[45:37] Jesus and he gave it to the
[45:39] angel the angel gave it to John and John
[45:43] writes
[45:44] it all right right now I want to
[45:49] emphasize that because see I want you to
[45:54] see what did it's you know sometimes the
[45:58] Angels dealing sometimes it's John
[46:00] sometimes it's Jesus I want you to think
[46:03] of that because to me it's very vital to
[46:07] understand right amen all right so now
[46:10] the it was told now the revelation God
[46:13] give to
[46:14] Jesus and he gave it to an
[46:17] angel to give to
[46:21] John now see if you took that point in
[46:25] every
[46:27] stage how would you be able
[46:30] to you know read verse
[46:34] two and see that John was
[46:40] right John said there was an
[46:43] angel come to
[46:48] him and he tells you what the angel
[46:52] done verse two what John says who who by
[46:56] record of the word of God the angel that
[46:58] come to
[47:00] him by record John's writing it
[47:04] down all right who by record of the word
[47:06] of God and of the testimony of Jesus
[47:09] Christ and of all things that he saw in
[47:12] other words all the Angels saw he tells
[47:16] John all right now so now listen then
[47:20] what does John
[47:24] say see now it's not the angel that says
[47:27] verse three that's
[47:32] John verse two is in between see and
[47:36] John telling you the angel told him and
[47:39] then John says blessed is he that read
[47:43] it see break it down like it's written
[47:48] amen I know people call me and say we
[47:51] don't understand you cuz you're you're
[47:52] you're too much of an intellect what's
[47:54] what's intellect when you're reading
[47:58] I mean 90% of you in here have have a
[48:00] lot more education I've
[48:06] got but see I I like to look at thing
[48:09] who's
[48:10] talking what's he talking about and is
[48:13] he talking about himself if not I'm like
[48:17] that man in the scripture you know that
[48:18] come wouldn't Phillip he was reading the
[48:21] scripture and Philip come up to him you
[48:22] know and said understand what I reading
[48:25] he said I can understand it un let
[48:26] somebody teach me right he said is this
[48:29] man talking about himself or is he
[48:32] talking about
[48:33] another that's
[48:37] right that's the way I like it so let's
[48:40] do that just a minute you know it may
[48:42] not mean anything to you but it does to
[48:44] me to be able to break it down and see
[48:47] now so John once he sees
[48:51] this he shouts out blessed is he that
[48:54] readeth they that hear the words of this
[48:58] prophecy and keep those things which are
[49:00] written there in for the time is at
[49:03] hand that's his statement from what the
[49:06] angel told
[49:08] him about the revelation of Jesus Christ
[49:12] now what is your
[49:17] statement after all that God is revealed
[49:20] to you what is your
[49:22] statement can't you say blessed are
[49:27] they that can
[49:31] understand now
[49:33] look you say well you don't know I don't
[49:36] know well okay let's go to verse four
[49:37] and
[49:41] see after verse 1 and two the angel
[49:44] delivers to
[49:48] John he shouts Glory Hallelujah then
[49:51] what
[49:53] John now the angel was telling and John
[49:55] to write this
[49:57] right but John is putting it
[50:00] down John to the seven churches which
[50:03] are in
[50:04] Asia Grace be unto you and peace from
[50:09] him which is and which was and which is
[50:13] to come and from the seven spirits which
[50:16] are before his
[50:18] throne now what I like for you to do
[50:20] sometime don't have to do it now
[50:23] but I want you to know notice how many
[50:26] times A and D is there right I'm what
[50:30] does that mean
[50:32] and now we're going to get to it in a
[50:34] minute and you'll see why well I'll go
[50:36] ahead and say it to you because when we
[50:37] get down to verse 11 before he starts in
[50:40] verse 11 to say anything brother
[50:42] brandham says on patmas Vision paragraph
[50:45] 97 he said before you begin to write
[50:48] anything down I want you to know who I
[50:51] am amen
[50:54] right he said said for you begin to
[50:56] write down in other words I want you to
[50:59] know who I
[51:00] am well here's a man that's been
[51:02] preaching in for 60
[51:05] years right cuz this is about 95 about
[51:08] somewhere around 65 years or something
[51:11] but now listen John to the seven
[51:14] churches which are in Asia Grace be unto
[51:18] you and you can translate that even see
[51:22] it's it's the word and and even is
[51:24] translated to either way
[51:26] okay grace be unto you and
[51:30] peace from him which is now John is
[51:34] writing to tell the people what God has
[51:37] given
[51:38] him and he's trying to show the
[51:42] US who's talking to
[51:44] him now who's talking to
[51:48] John so well an angel was talking to him
[51:50] that's good but he's telling us what
[51:54] Jesus said
[51:56] that the father gave him to
[51:59] bring okay the revelation of Jesus
[52:02] Christ so now look who is Jesus
[52:06] Christ Grace be unto you and peace from
[52:08] him which
[52:12] is do we need to go all the way through
[52:14] the scriptures with that to show you
[52:17] who's that talking about Jesus
[52:20] Christ which
[52:24] was
[52:26] H is he Hebrews
[52:30] 138 from him which is which was and
[52:34] which is to come who are we looking
[52:36] forward to come
[52:39] and from the seven spirits which are
[52:41] before his
[52:44] throne so just translate that even in
[52:47] there and read
[52:52] it see when Paul said the God and father
[52:54] of our Lord Jesus Christ God and Father
[52:58] look like
[52:59] two but read it God even
[53:03] father of our Lord Jesus Christ now
[53:06] that's the way your Prophet said you can
[53:08] translate so let's read it the way he
[53:11] translated verse
[53:13] four Grace be unto you even peace from
[53:17] him which is even which was even which
[53:21] is to come and from the seven even from
[53:24] the seven Spirits which are before his
[53:26] throne even from Jesus Christ who is the
[53:30] faithful witness even the first begotten
[53:33] of the Dead even the prince of the kings
[53:36] of the earth unto him that loved us even
[53:39] washed us from washed us from our sins
[53:43] in his own blood and ha made us Kings
[53:46] even priests unto God even his father to
[53:49] him be glory even Dominion
[53:52] forever and ever right any problem with
[53:56] reading it that way but does that help
[53:58] you understand
[54:02] right now my point is this look up how
[54:04] many times the word and is in the first
[54:07] seven or eight verses but just remember
[54:10] you're talking about one person
[54:14] right you're not talking about a
[54:17] Trinity
[54:19] right he's simply
[54:22] using and showing us who this is
[54:28] right right John is showing us who this
[54:31] is
[54:34] watch he's made us Kings and Priests
[54:37] unto his father and to him be glory even
[54:39] Dominion forever even ever behold he
[54:43] cometh with clouds even ever I shall see
[54:46] him even they also which Pierce him even
[54:50] all kindreds of the Earth shall wh
[54:52] because of him even so amen
[54:57] now look at the next
[55:00] verse is that red letter Edition in your
[55:03] Bible right you know that means Jesus
[55:05] speaking
[55:11] personally so now John's telling us what
[55:13] the angel said about
[55:17] him
[55:19] right he's telling us what he
[55:22] got but look what he says
[55:26] all of this person and all this all this
[55:29] is summed up into one thing I am Alpha
[55:32] and Omega the
[55:33] beginning even the ending say the Lord
[55:36] which is even which was even which is to
[55:40] come right the
[55:44] almighty that's not the angel
[55:51] talking that's Jesus
[55:54] himself
[55:55] he's showing you that's what he
[55:59] is he's all of this the one to come the
[56:02] one that was the one it
[56:07] is
[56:09] right read the Bible for
[56:14] yourself but read it with sensible
[56:17] understanding third grade reading and
[56:19] another you know what third grade
[56:21] reading
[56:22] is you know third grade reading is that
[56:24] you don't have enough sense to be able
[56:26] to figure out all these big words and
[56:28] things so you just do the best you can
[56:30] to read
[56:31] it
[56:33] huh and you know what third grade
[56:35] reading is you got to look at that
[56:39] word now anybody here with uh let's see
[56:43] Abby
[56:45] uh no n she's already enough um
[56:49] Levi you take that to them and you say
[56:52] uh what's in words
[56:58] right they don't know what them words
[57:00] are what you know about Levi's learn it
[57:04] a Hanah I mean aby's learning it n's got
[57:08] her working on on Words and I mean on
[57:10] things you know what does the this mean
[57:13] what does the word dog start with
[57:19] D but you know it's amazing what
[57:22] happens maybe you're can't remember
[57:26] maybe you're too
[57:28] smart you remember when you take
[57:31] something and look at the
[57:34] word I see
[57:37] it I don't have to go a n d i t u r n e
[57:46] d t o That's to s e e
[57:52] c t h e you don't do that do you
[57:58] right why because your mind has been
[58:01] captivated through studying to the basis
[58:03] that you just look at that word and
[58:05] there it
[58:06] is all right right but these little kids
[58:10] can't do
[58:12] that
[58:13] know well you know I think that's the
[58:15] way we've done the gospel right that we
[58:19] we try to look around to find out what
[58:20] it all means when we don't do it but get
[58:23] my point
[58:28] the angel gives John the understanding
[58:32] of who this is but once he finishes with
[58:35] the understanding to John he himself
[58:39] steps
[58:42] forth
[58:45] right he himself steps
[58:48] forward and just using simple little
[58:50] things you know to illustrate it uh
[58:53] years ago Zachary he couldn't read and
[58:57] uh he got kind of upset and most of you
[58:59] know the story he got a little upset
[59:01] about cuz they was going to make him go
[59:03] to
[59:04] kindergarten and uh he got pretty ill
[59:08] about it you know cuz he didn't want to
[59:10] go and he even got some ads about it
[59:13] he'd tell him say Well daddy next time
[59:14] we go on vacation just leave Mama at
[59:17] home cuz he didn't want to
[59:20] learn but you know what they finally got
[59:22] around to it and they said now poppy you
[59:24] got to do something cuz he got mad at
[59:26] Nanny and he got mad at his mother cuz
[59:29] he's going to send him to
[59:31] school well what are you going to do
[59:33] with a
[59:34] 5-year-old you
[59:37] know so I you know you pray well what
[59:40] can I say to him so I I I knew Zachary
[59:44] you know his nature and his ways
[59:48] and I said Zachary I said you know when
[59:51] we're sitting around right before
[59:53] Christmas and and we spell these words
[59:56] that we're going to buy you for
[59:58] Christmas these
[1:00:00] presents you don't know what that is do
[1:00:03] you he said no papa don't
[1:00:06] know I said well if you'll go to school
[1:00:10] and you learn to
[1:00:11] read then when we try to spell you'll
[1:00:14] know what we
[1:00:16] spelling you know what he went school
[1:00:18] the next day and he made a
[1:00:21] year that was what clicked in his mind
[1:00:25] and he was ready y all right now that's
[1:00:28] all I'm trying to do with you and
[1:00:33] me is to click that thing to where we
[1:00:36] don't have to spell it out a n d and n i
[1:00:44] I know that one t u r n e d what does
[1:00:49] that
[1:00:50] mean we don't have to do
[1:00:53] that in the gospel is what I'm talking
[1:00:58] about to get a seasoned in the gospel
[1:01:01] until we can look in the word of God and
[1:01:03] everywhere we look we find Jesus that's
[1:01:06] right is that not what your Prophet said
[1:01:09] amen he said if you don't find Jesus in
[1:01:12] every verse back up or maybe he said
[1:01:15] Christ make sure I get it right for the
[1:01:17] bigger ones you know he said if you if
[1:01:20] you don't see Christ in every verse he
[1:01:22] said back up and read it again because
[1:01:24] you missed y amen well when so and so we
[1:01:27] got so and so and so and so we got so
[1:01:28] and so and so and so we got so and so
[1:01:29] and I got so tired of that reading the
[1:01:31] first time in the Bible didn't
[1:01:33] you I really wasn't concerned about who
[1:01:36] we got
[1:01:38] who well see that's a
[1:01:40] record it was in the word of God then
[1:01:42] right in the middle of all of that
[1:01:44] you'll find a secret laying there A lot
[1:01:46] of times and it let's jump off the pages
[1:01:48] to you right amen all right now
[1:01:51] listen but when the angel gets through
[1:01:54] delivered the message to
[1:01:56] John about this person that person steps
[1:02:00] on the
[1:02:03] scene
[1:02:05] well is not that's what the message of
[1:02:08] the hour is supposed to
[1:02:13] do is not the message of the hour
[1:02:16] supposed to bring
[1:02:18] Christ to you and
[1:02:22] I I thought that's what the message
[1:02:24] would I didn't know it was all of this
[1:02:26] stuff that everybody talking about seals
[1:02:27] files plagues trumpets theophanies and
[1:02:29] all these big words that they think it
[1:02:31] makes them look so
[1:02:35] big it's the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:02:38] that's right but as Jesus Christ stepped
[1:02:41] on the scene to you from what you what
[1:02:43] you've
[1:02:44] read has he come on the scene to you as
[1:02:47] to what you
[1:02:48] studied or can somebody deprogram you
[1:02:51] now and give you a
[1:02:53] trinity
[1:02:55] come
[1:02:56] on if it's not a revelation they sure do
[1:02:59] it okay so you getting the
[1:03:02] point so verse n watch I
[1:03:08] John this is not what the angel told
[1:03:11] him this is not what Jesus told
[1:03:16] him this is what John is
[1:03:18] saying I John and he's going to tell you
[1:03:23] where he was at
[1:03:26] and what he was doing
[1:03:29] there John is not the angel not Jesus
[1:03:33] not
[1:03:37] God so look at it I
[1:03:41] John who Al look in glasses where
[1:03:45] read I John who also am your brother and
[1:03:49] companion in Tribulation and in the
[1:03:51] kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ
[1:03:54] what watch was in the aisle that is
[1:03:56] called
[1:03:58] patmas
[1:03:59] watch far the word of God and for the
[1:04:02] testimony of Jesus Christ now you
[1:04:04] remember the reason he was put out there
[1:04:06] was because he was trying to put the he
[1:04:08] was trying to get it into Scrolls in
[1:04:09] other words the the writings of the
[1:04:12] Bible and you know uh this is John now
[1:04:14] not John the
[1:04:16] Baptist this is John that was there when
[1:04:19] Jesus was with him the John Walking With
[1:04:21] Jesus that wrote the Book of John
[1:04:25] all right now so he's telling us where
[1:04:28] he's at and what he's there for he knows
[1:04:30] why He's there right he was trying to
[1:04:33] bring it down to get it into Scrolls and
[1:04:36] things that could be held by the people
[1:04:38] and kept and read and they put him on
[1:04:41] the patas you know the story that the
[1:04:43] prophet told how they even boiled him in
[1:04:45] oil for 24 hours to try to get the
[1:04:47] spirit out of him and couldn't and they
[1:04:49] thought his so bewitched cuz they
[1:04:51] couldn't burn him up but let decided
[1:04:53] they' better get rid of him so they
[1:04:54] throw him out on on patmas and patmas
[1:04:57] was kind of like alcatra there was no
[1:04:59] way to get on and off of it and sharks
[1:05:02] had eat you up you tried to get out and
[1:05:03] things so they throw him out there where
[1:05:05] he was nothing but snakes and rocks and
[1:05:08] things you it was like a prison place
[1:05:11] right he knew what he was out there
[1:05:15] far right so that's what he's telling
[1:05:18] you I was out there for this
[1:05:21] reason now watching
[1:05:26] I was in the spirit on the Lord's
[1:05:28] day and heard behind me a great
[1:05:32] voice as of a
[1:05:36] trumpet now if you notice the Vex verse
[1:05:39] it says
[1:05:41] saying that's in Black
[1:05:44] letter cuz that's part of what John is
[1:05:46] talking about then it jumps to red
[1:05:48] letter right are you looking at it and
[1:05:50] seeing it you know what's the point he
[1:05:53] said I was in the spirit on the Lord's
[1:05:57] day now we'll just title this Lord's day
[1:06:00] because I want to get this point to
[1:06:04] you he said I was in the spirit on the
[1:06:06] Lord's
[1:06:09] day
[1:06:11] now what is the Lord's
[1:06:16] day
[1:06:19] now just in case somebody comes along
[1:06:21] and says well I know this and I'll just
[1:06:23] give it to you brother Ram was calling
[1:06:25] at one time you know that he called the
[1:06:27] Lord's Day the day of the
[1:06:33] Resurrection in about two times or three
[1:06:37] he called the Lord's day
[1:06:41] Sunday could he said like we don't sell
[1:06:43] on the Lord's
[1:06:47] day he's calling it
[1:06:50] Sunday but then when he come on down in
[1:06:53] later as he began to understand and not
[1:06:56] later as far as way off
[1:06:59] time he began to talk about the Lord to
[1:07:02] day amen
[1:07:06] right and he said now the Seventh Day
[1:07:09] Adventist he said they believe that
[1:07:11] Saturday is the Lord's day and said the
[1:07:14] Protestants they believe that Sunday is
[1:07:16] the Lord's day and he wasn't arguing
[1:07:19] about it right because you know what the
[1:07:22] Sabbath is the old the Saturday is the
[1:07:25] Old Testament
[1:07:28] Sabbath and that was the Lord's day of
[1:07:30] the Old Testament nothing wrong with
[1:07:34] it but then Sunday being the first day
[1:07:37] of the week because of the
[1:07:40] Resurrection then it can be called The
[1:07:42] Lord's Day
[1:07:45] right we see then you come down and say
[1:07:48] well brother Ram
[1:07:50] now John said he was in the spirit
[1:07:54] right now you know how he covered all
[1:07:56] that so you can go through it he said
[1:07:58] the the the key to all understanding is
[1:08:01] to first get in the spirit amen and he
[1:08:04] said that's what John done amen he got
[1:08:07] in the spirit and he said there's our
[1:08:09] problem we don't get in the spirit come
[1:08:13] on and the scripture says if I he say
[1:08:16] you know if I do this or what it Paul
[1:08:18] said let let me do it in the spirit you
[1:08:21] know if I sing let me sing in the spirit
[1:08:23] if I do that
[1:08:24] whatever we do supposed to be done in
[1:08:26] the spirit of God you
[1:08:29] agree all right
[1:08:32] now but he says but he was in the spirit
[1:08:36] on the Lord's
[1:08:37] day
[1:08:39] amen now brother brandom what is the
[1:08:43] Lord's day that you would be coming on
[1:08:45] down
[1:08:52] to I'm doing this kind of reverse to
[1:08:55] what maybe I should but I want to get
[1:08:58] this out of the way of the Lord's day
[1:08:59] and then we'll do that have two tonight
[1:09:01] and we'll take a rest
[1:09:03] later page 51 Church age book there he
[1:09:07] stands one like son of man as the jewel
[1:09:10] is beautified by the mounting of the
[1:09:12] ring so he is glorified in the midst of
[1:09:14] his churches it is the Lord's day for
[1:09:18] John sees him
[1:09:20] standing not as a priest
[1:09:24] but as the coming
[1:09:29] judg now he's telling you what this is
[1:09:31] in Revelations one
[1:09:36] now the golden girdle is no longer
[1:09:39] around in the waist where the priest
[1:09:41] must wear it as he ministers to God in
[1:09:44] the holiest place but it is now around
[1:09:47] his
[1:09:48] shoulders for he is not now the priest
[1:09:51] but the judge
[1:09:54] right now has John 5:22 come to pass for
[1:09:58] the father
[1:09:59] judges no man but ha committed all
[1:10:02] judgment unto the son his service has
[1:10:04] been rendered the priesthood is over the
[1:10:08] days of Prophecy are finished he stands
[1:10:11] GED as the
[1:10:14] judge now he said this is what happened
[1:10:16] here in Revelations
[1:10:19] 1 okay I told you I'm having to use this
[1:10:22] kind of a way and want to get back to
[1:10:24] you
[1:10:26] right patmas Vision 1960 1204 the
[1:10:30] evening service paragraph
[1:10:34] 167 he's coming down on the one clothed
[1:10:37] one golden candlesticks one like the son
[1:10:39] of man clothed with a garment down to
[1:10:41] the foot and G about to pouch with a
[1:10:42] golden girdle now here's more proof that
[1:10:45] this Doctrine is
[1:10:48] right there now here's more proof that
[1:10:51] this Doctrine is right about being the
[1:10:53] Lord's day did you notice he was not a
[1:10:56] priest during this time neither was he a
[1:10:59] king he was a
[1:11:02] judge notice a
[1:11:05] priest a high priest when he went into
[1:11:08] the sanctuary or went into the ministry
[1:11:10] to the service he tied himself around
[1:11:12] the
[1:11:13] waist tying his girdle around the waist
[1:11:16] meant that was that he was serving right
[1:11:20] amen never tied it over his
[1:11:22] shoulders but here he comes out walking
[1:11:26] out with the girdle tied around the
[1:11:30] top now listen to the
[1:11:36] wording walking out with a girdle tied
[1:11:39] around the
[1:11:40] top with a sash over his
[1:11:45] shoulder G about the PS the breast with
[1:11:51] a golden girdle gted up high
[1:11:54] what is it an attorney a
[1:11:57] judge a judge with his sash over his
[1:12:00] shoulders GED up here not down as a
[1:12:04] priest see that he shows he wasn't in
[1:12:07] his priesthood now John went all the way
[1:12:10] into the Lord's day and saw him coming
[1:12:15] as
[1:12:16] judge that's right now that's what he
[1:12:19] sees in Revelations
[1:12:22] 1
[1:12:24] okay we get time I'll get back to the
[1:12:27] other part of it you know what I've
[1:12:30] preached but he's seeing him as
[1:12:35] judge
[1:12:39] y he's showing him as the
[1:12:45] judge at the day of
[1:12:50] judgment the Lord's Day the prophet said
[1:12:53] is when man's Days Are
[1:12:58] Over The Lord's day is the Judgment Day
[1:13:01] at the white Trump
[1:13:05] right
[1:13:07] okay right that's
[1:13:13] read attiring Church age 1960
[1:13:19] 128 between his Priestly operation when
[1:13:22] the sanctuary left
[1:13:23] then we find him standing there John
[1:13:26] said he was in the spirit on the Lord's
[1:13:28] day not the seventh day not Sunday
[1:13:31] that's all mistaken we found that out
[1:13:34] searched it through the Scripture it was
[1:13:35] the Lord's
[1:13:36] day this is the day of man the coming of
[1:13:40] the Lord will be his day we find him in
[1:13:44] the Lord's day when he's when he seeing
[1:13:48] the Lord he had on a snow white high and
[1:13:52] we know that represents a judge another
[1:13:55] thing he was not priest then cu the
[1:13:58] priest was tied around the middle mean
[1:14:00] service but he was tied around the paths
[1:14:03] up here which meant that he was a judge
[1:14:06] amen and we see him walking in the midst
[1:14:08] of the seven golden
[1:14:11] candlesticks and now we took back to the
[1:14:14] Ancient of
[1:14:16] Days being white at the white Throne
[1:14:19] judgment when Daniel saw him come to the
[1:14:22] ancient of days whose hair was white as
[1:14:24] snow and he goes on telling about the
[1:14:27] old English
[1:14:28] judges mark of the beast 1961
[1:14:32] 217 John didn't see him on the Sabbath
[1:14:35] day or on Sunday he seen him in the
[1:14:37] Lord's Day the coming of the Lord when
[1:14:39] he was
[1:14:42] judged right not know these other
[1:14:47] days we see him over in here we see him
[1:14:51] when he come Daniel saw him
[1:14:54] and he come with 10,000 time
[1:14:57] 10,000s of his
[1:14:59] Saints is that right and the books were
[1:15:02] open and another book was open which was
[1:15:03] the book of life and every man see there
[1:15:06] comes up your lukewarm Church sleeping
[1:15:08] virgin here's the real one with him come
[1:15:11] from glory after being at the wedding

[1:15:28] day is
[1:15:29] not if it is not Saturday or Sunday what
[1:15:33] is it well let's put it in this way

[1:15:39] day this is man's day it is man's doing
[1:15:43] man's work man's Church man's idea of
[1:15:45] worship man's everything for it is man's
[1:15:48] world Cosmos but the day of the Lord is
[1:15:51] coming yes it is it is just that that at
[1:15:54] this time of the revelation of Jesus
[1:15:56] Christ John was taken up by the spirit
[1:16:00] and transported by the spirit to that
[1:16:02] graay that day is coming the days when
[1:16:06] the the days of man is
[1:16:11] over the kingdoms of this world will
[1:16:13] then become the kingdoms of our God the
[1:16:16] day of the Lord is when the judgments
[1:16:20] fall okay
[1:16:24] now I can go ahead and say it but it get
[1:16:26] you confusing but after that comes to

[1:18:32] that scripture says that will'll judge
[1:18:35] even angels right right but do you see
[1:18:39] what I'm trying to
[1:18:43] get John got in the spirit on the Lord's
[1:18:50] day
[1:18:51] before the church ages ever
[1:18:56] started before God even wrote about the
[1:18:59] church
[1:19:00] ages John is taken in the spirit all the
[1:19:03] way to the white Throne
[1:19:05] judgment that's right

[1:19:12] little bit if I got time in a minute
[1:19:13] we'll drop
[1:19:14] back but

[1:19:19] judgment we set on the white throne with
[1:19:22] him all right let's prove that
[1:19:26] okay let's read some scriptures that
[1:19:29] will fit together so let's start off

[1:21:35] 7 and verse
[1:21:39] 9 and you'll see this is the white
[1:21:41] Throne
[1:21:43] judgment and it should take it out of
[1:21:45] your mind when I get back to it if we
[1:21:47] have time that this is the bride of
[1:21:51] Christ everybody got it Daniel
[1:21:55] 7:9 I beheld till the Thrones were cast

[1:22:29] fire right same place isn't it am
[1:22:34] man this is the white thr judgment right
[1:22:38] okay the anchor it down let's go over to
[1:22:39] Revelation
[1:22:41] 20 keep your finger between
[1:22:43] these you know hold like
[1:22:47] C cuz we'll go from one to the other
[1:22:49] back to the other so you won't have to
[1:22:51] be flipping and flipping just all your
[1:22:54] there Revelations
[1:22:59] 19 excuse me 20 everybody got it
[1:23:02] Revelation
[1:23:05] 20 verse
[1:23:07] 11 and I saw a white
[1:23:12] throne and him that sat on it from whose
[1:23:15] face the earth and the heaven fled away
[1:23:18] there was found no place for
[1:23:21] them and that's saw the dead small and
[1:23:23] great stand before God and the books
[1:23:26] were open same as it says if you go on
[1:23:29] down in verse 10 of Daniel 7 and verse
[1:23:33] 10 it talks about judgment was set and
[1:23:37] the books were open books
[1:23:42] plural now brother randam says page 464
[1:23:46] of the 10 virgins the first book is the
[1:23:48] book of the
[1:23:50] Sinners so that's Go's going to be
[1:23:52] judged right who's that other
[1:23:56] book it's the book to see whether or not
[1:23:58] your name is in
[1:23:59] it
[1:24:02] books not just one book you see it's
[1:24:05] just the Bible yeah because the Bible
[1:24:07] contains the people that will never be
[1:24:10] saved the Bible contains the foolish
[1:24:13] virgins the Bible contains the bride so
[1:24:17] sure it's the Bible but it's called
[1:24:19] books go into the church age book I'll
[1:24:22] be glad to go through it with you with
[1:24:23] Brother r or it's invisible Union
[1:24:26] invisible Union where he says that it
[1:24:29] says
[1:24:30] books he said you will get confused
[1:24:33] there
[1:24:35] right cuz it's not two books it's the
[1:24:39] Bible the Bible contains a record of the
[1:24:43] people who are going to be killed right
[1:24:46] it contains the record of the foolish
[1:24:48] virgins it contains the record of the
[1:24:51] Bride so books all right so then verse
[1:24:55] 12 now still that and I saw the dead
[1:24:56] small and great stand before God and the
[1:24:58] books were open and another book was
[1:25:00] open watch that which is The Book of
[1:25:03] Life and the dead was judged out of
[1:25:06] those things which were written in the
[1:25:08] books according to their Works judas's
[1:25:11] name was written in the book of
[1:25:14] life now that's in the church A's book
[1:25:16] be glad to cover it we but it was not
[1:25:19] written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:25:21] section which is eternal life because
[1:25:24] judas's name was written in the book of
[1:25:26] life but his name could be taken out of
[1:25:28] the book of life you can have a name
[1:25:30] taken out of the book of life but not
[1:25:32] taken out of the Lamb Book of Life The
[1:25:34] Eternal section right right that's how
[1:25:36] perfect God's word is
[1:25:39] what and the Sea gave up the dead which
[1:25:42] were in it and death and Hell delivered
[1:25:45] of the Dead which were in them this is
[1:25:47] white thr judgment and they were judged
[1:25:49] every man according to their works and
[1:25:51] death and hell was cast into the Lake of
[1:25:52] Fire this is the second death and
[1:25:56] whosoever was not found written in the
[1:25:58] Book of Life was cast into the Lake of
[1:26:01] Fire so at the white Throne judgment
[1:26:04] there books Daniel says these books he
[1:26:06] gives you the picture of the of the the
[1:26:08] one sitting there with
[1:26:10] the white high like wool The Book of
[1:26:14] Revelations gave you this same symbol of
[1:26:17] the white like
[1:26:19] wool
[1:26:21] right
[1:26:23] so are you following
[1:26:24] me now let's read
[1:26:26] it we'll cover just a
[1:26:31] minute I was in the spirit we're back in
[1:26:33] Revelations
[1:26:36] 101 I was in the spirit 110 excuse
[1:26:40] me on the Lord's day well I can go to
[1:26:43] 101 do the same
[1:26:46] thing CU brother R said Revelations
[1:26:49] 10:1 when the angel comes down one foot
[1:26:52] on landing on sea he said it's
[1:26:53] Revelations 1 right 14
[1:26:59] amen we're looking for some kind of a
[1:27:02] great big something to happen out there
[1:27:03] and not seeing is what Jesus Christ is
[1:27:07] doing like my brother-in-law was the
[1:27:09] badest preacher you know he he believed
[1:27:12] that Beast was great big
[1:27:15] animal walking across the earth I said
[1:27:18] where's that going to deceive
[1:27:21] anybody I mean you see the
[1:27:24] thing great big old whale war stuff a
[1:27:26] few weeks after then I told my wife I
[1:27:29] said Robert's probably holl and Glory
[1:27:31] that there that great big beast come
[1:27:33] walking up but it's dead you know but
[1:27:38] listen and I was in the spirit on the
[1:27:40] Lord's day now John was taken to the
[1:27:43] Judgment Day
[1:27:46] right the description of Revelations 1
[1:27:50] through 14 and all the clothing f it's
[1:27:52] exactly Daniel
[1:27:54] 7:9 the high the world of things so what
[1:27:58] is it talking about the Ancient of Days
[1:28:01] but remember in the Book of Daniel there
[1:28:03] is thousands upon thousands ministering
[1:28:05] unto him which is the bride that's right
[1:28:08] she sits in judgment with him on the
[1:28:11] Judgment seat amen not before the
[1:28:14] Judgment seat to be judged cuz come on
[1:28:17] you've already went in the Rapture you
[1:28:20] went through the millennium right you
[1:28:23] went through all of that in eternity and
[1:28:25] then you got to come to the white throne
[1:28:26] and be judged to decide whether or not
[1:28:29] you can go to
[1:28:31] heaven there's something wrong with your
[1:28:33] mentality that's
[1:28:35] true think and just take it like it is
[1:28:39] so what was John transported
[1:28:42] to and he heard and I heard and heard
[1:28:45] behind me a great voice and of a trumpet
[1:28:51] saying
[1:28:52] and when he heard that trumpet look at
[1:28:54] it red
[1:28:56] letter it's not an
[1:28:58] angel it's not a
[1:29:01] prophet was God himself amen
[1:29:05] speaking to John
[1:29:08] right I am Alpha and Omega the first and
[1:29:12] the
[1:29:12] last look and is in black jumping right
[1:29:15] back to word over the other what thou
[1:29:19] seeth write in the book and send it unto
[1:29:20] the seven churches which are in
[1:29:23] Asia unto Ephesus unto samna unto
[1:29:25] pergamus and un tiarra and unto Sardis
[1:29:28] and under Philadelphia and under lady
[1:29:30] oia all right
[1:29:33] now look what John says not the angel
[1:29:37] told
[1:29:39] him John says I turned to see The Voice
[1:29:45] amen he had heard a
[1:29:48] voice brother Ram I'm be glad to show it
[1:29:51] to you he said John didn't turn to see
[1:29:53] the
[1:29:56] person goes come on
[1:29:59] Church John already knew who this
[1:30:03] was he knew the person was
[1:30:07] Jesus what I'm getting that John knew
[1:30:10] that voice he'd live with it for three
[1:30:12] and A2
[1:30:15] years he was turning to see
[1:30:19] Jesus y because that was his voice y
[1:30:21] amen right right y I mean we's in a
[1:30:25] crowd in the
[1:30:27] story and they're yaking yaking yaking
[1:30:29] yaking yacking and I see hey
[1:30:34] Danny you know Danny's not going to look
[1:30:36] for Brother
[1:30:37] Dean right why cuz he knows my
[1:30:43] voice he's been around enough long
[1:30:45] enough to know my voice I can't even
[1:30:46] disguise my voice on the telephone every
[1:30:49] time I pick it up everybody knows who I
[1:30:50] am
[1:30:52] most of the time even anybody heard it
[1:30:54] one time they say know Sam cuz they know
[1:30:57] my voice it's just a unique one it's you
[1:31:00] know it's
[1:31:01] mine but listen John turned as the
[1:31:06] prophet
[1:31:07] said not he was turning expecting to see
[1:31:11] Jesus Christ why because verse 11 tells
[1:31:14] you who this was that the voice sounded
[1:31:19] it was the almighty God Jesus Christ
[1:31:22] standing
[1:31:23] there but look at him when he
[1:31:27] turned and I turned to see the voice
[1:31:29] that fate with
[1:31:31] me in being turned I saw seven golden
[1:31:39] candlesticks he was expecting to see
[1:31:42] Jesus he saw him than Lord right cuz it
[1:31:46] was putting symbols was
[1:31:49] it he saw seven golden candles six now
[1:31:53] am I TR do we need to drop down and read
[1:31:55] the mystery verse
[1:31:57] 20 The Mystery of the Seven Stars which
[1:32:00] thou sawest in the right hand of the
[1:32:01] seven and the Seven golden Candlestick
[1:32:03] the Seven Stars are the Angels of the
[1:32:05] seven churches and the seven candles
[1:32:07] which th saw us are the seven
[1:32:10] churches right now God interprets that
[1:32:13] in red
[1:32:15] letter right watch
[1:32:19] me and I turned to see The Voice that
[1:32:21] spake with me and being turned I saw
[1:32:24] seven golden
[1:32:26] candlesticks listen to what your Prophet
[1:32:32] said you've heard this over and over and
[1:32:35] over most of you have
[1:32:37] anyway if I can find
[1:32:41] it paragraph 180 of why we are not a
[1:32:45] denomination preached in 1958
[1:32:48] 927 now if you ever notice watch these
[1:32:51] churches ages then we'll close then in
[1:32:53] the morning we're going to pick up these
[1:32:55] other things watch under the golden
[1:32:58] candlesticks of the Jewish Tabernacle in
[1:33:00] the inside of the shoe bread and so
[1:33:03] forth there were seven golden
[1:33:04] candlesticks all of you know that and
[1:33:06] there are seven Church ages that speaks
[1:33:08] of seven Church ages alike if you notice
[1:33:12] in Revelations 1 we find Jesus standing
[1:33:16] in the seven Church
[1:33:18] ages the seven golden candlesticks when
[1:33:21] he turned and saw one like unto the son
[1:33:24] of
[1:33:25] man standing clothed with her how was it
[1:33:30] what brother R said now how was
[1:33:33] it it was a bride standing in the
[1:33:37] candlesticks dra
[1:33:39] out that's his
[1:33:41] interpretation so what are you looking
[1:33:43] at in the Book of Revelation you're
[1:33:45] looking at the
[1:33:46] ride well just got all kind of look like
[1:33:49] this and look like that look like that
[1:33:52] see you're trying to figure it out right
[1:33:55] just
[1:33:56] read amen what is this bride look
[1:34:00] like and I turned to see The Voice being
[1:34:03] turned I saw seven golden scandles when
[1:34:05] in and in the midst of the seven
[1:34:06] candlesticks one like unto the son of
[1:34:09] man it didn't say it was the son of man
[1:34:12] right I've got one at home I'll bring
[1:34:14] back to you later brother BR said he saw
[1:34:16] the Son of
[1:34:19] God he said no no no it's said Son of
[1:34:22] you're not getting it he saw the Son of
[1:34:23] God which is the church down to the
[1:34:25] church ages that was Son of
[1:34:28] God but when you get to hear it's
[1:34:30] already to the white Throne it's son of
[1:34:31] man right it's over with that's right in
[1:34:35] the midst of the seven candlesticks one
[1:34:36] like another son of man clothe with a
[1:34:38] garment down to the foot and gir about
[1:34:40] to pouch with a golden
[1:34:43] girdle now remember p is femish okay you

[1:34:59] talking about the Holiness of Jesus
[1:35:01] covering her oh wait let's go back and
[1:35:03] redress that's what the what the spirit
[1:35:05] said the candlesticks all right now in
[1:35:08] the 13th verse and in the midst of seven
[1:35:10] candlesticks one like the son of man who
[1:35:13] one like him who was this his bride one
[1:35:17] like him watch How It Was clo with the
[1:35:19] Garment down to the foot the holiness of
[1:35:21] Jesus Christ covering her has washed us
[1:35:24] from our sins with his own blood all
[1:35:26] right G about the paths not a man a
[1:35:34] woman the gospel that held the power and
[1:35:37] of and glory of God over the body of
[1:35:43] Christ heard about the
[1:35:46] passs you remember down here when I was
[1:35:48] saying to you what ago was reading it

[1:35:57] it was a sash hanging over his
[1:36:01] shoulders but said he was G about the
[1:36:04] passs it's got to be a feminist
[1:36:06] description

[1:36:11] describing a feminist
[1:36:13] description all right now let's prove it
[1:36:17] and we'll just keep on reading and I'll
[1:36:19] come back to this
[1:36:20] later
[1:36:23] G about the pouch with a golden verle
[1:36:24] verse 14 and his head and his HS were
[1:36:27] white like wolf remember white Throne
[1:36:29] judgment as white as snow and his eyes
[1:36:32] were a flame of fire listen and his feet
[1:36:34] like a Define Bry as they were burned in
[1:36:37] the furnace and his voice as the sound
[1:36:39] of many
[1:36:41] Waters page 57 Church age book brother
[1:36:44] brandham says many witnesses many
[1:36:47] preachers CU Waters means people right
[1:36:50] amen
[1:36:52] amen what's he seeing the bride and in
[1:36:56] his right hand Seven Stars and is out of
[1:36:59] his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword
[1:37:01] and his countenance was as the sun
[1:37:03] shineth in his strength listen to this
[1:37:06] and when I saw him I fell at his feet is
[1:37:08] dead and he laid his right hand upon me
[1:37:10] saying unto me red letter
[1:37:15] now who is
[1:37:18] this Jesus Christ
[1:37:22] fear not I am the first and the last I
[1:37:24] am he that liveth and was dead and
[1:37:26] behold I am alive forever more amen and
[1:37:29] have the keys of death and Hell amen
[1:37:31] write the things which thou H has seen
[1:37:33] and the things which are and the things
[1:37:35] which shall be here after let's see page
[1:37:40] 122 patmas Vision which would be Church
[1:37:42] age book brother brandham said this is
[1:37:45] not a
[1:37:47] Prophet this is
[1:37:50] God
[1:37:52] this is not an
[1:37:54] angel this is God he said but where's he
[1:38:00] shown in Bride
[1:38:02] form that's right it is in Bride form
[1:38:06] yes now as we go on through the the
[1:38:08] church ages and the different things we
[1:38:10] pick it up we'll prove that and then
[1:38:12] we'll come back to our day cuz what has
[1:38:13] been our point of what we've been
[1:38:14] talking about going on to
[1:38:18] Perfection how much more perfect
[1:38:21] could you think about being than to see
[1:38:24] you the place that you used to think now
[1:38:28] come
[1:38:29] on now some of you in here would say
[1:38:31] well I never did believe nothing
[1:38:33] well it's in the same shape don't matter
[1:38:36] but we used to believe that we all had
[1:38:38] to go to White through
[1:38:40] judgment
[1:38:42] right I didn't believe that well if you
[1:38:45] didn't that's all right but if you did
[1:38:47] you're a
[1:38:49] liar why don't you be on we thought we
[1:38:51] was going to the white Throne judgment
[1:38:53] cuz we thought nobody could do nothing
[1:38:55] unless they went to the white Throne
[1:38:56] judgment we thought we had to go to the
[1:38:58] white Throne judgment to be judged but
[1:39:00] we never considered anything about the
[1:39:02] blood of Jesus Christ being making us so
[1:39:04] perfect until we don't have to go to the
[1:39:06] white Throne
[1:39:10] right we used to believe we had to go
[1:39:13] there and it'd be decided one of these
[1:39:15] days where we going to heaven or
[1:39:18] not
[1:39:20] no that new birth decides it here you
[1:39:25] get the new birth you don't have to go
[1:39:26] to the white Throne judgment sure
[1:39:28] there's a judgment of the Deeds Done in
[1:39:29] the body whether good or bad yes but the
[1:39:32] bride that's not a judgment of eternal
[1:39:34] life that's a judgment of the Deeds that
[1:39:36] we have in our life that if we don't get
[1:39:37] rid of them we'll have to answer before
[1:39:40] the rest of the body of
[1:39:42] Christ but the bride does not go to the
[1:39:45] white thr judgment that's right she has
[1:39:47] nothing to be judged by right that's
[1:39:50] right
[1:39:53] was out at a certain place I won't make
[1:39:54] too many statements cuz when I do them a
[1:39:56] lot of people get offended we was in a
[1:39:58] certain place and this brother he said
[1:40:01] you know said I think my wife is stood
[1:40:03] the test said you know what I'm going to
[1:40:06] move her to town where we got running
[1:40:12] water now I can call Nam if you like but
[1:40:14] we
[1:40:16] won't in places cuz I
[1:40:19] there
[1:40:22] in other words he married his wife and
[1:40:23] to see whether she was a good wife or
[1:40:25] not he put her out in old sloppy house
[1:40:28] where they didn't have no running water
[1:40:30] no bathroom no nothing to see if she
[1:40:32] stood the
[1:40:35] test now brother
[1:40:37] dick how many years did you try sister
[1:40:40] Gail to see whether she stood the test
[1:40:42] or not or did you take her right off the
[1:40:47] bat for every good and bad it was going
[1:40:50] to go
[1:40:57] right I mean come on
[1:41:00] Amen did you put your wife to a test to
[1:41:03] see if she would be a good
[1:41:05] wife then you decided she's a pretty
[1:41:07] good wife I think I'll marry
[1:41:10] her I certainly didn't
[1:41:16] mind I didn't test
[1:41:18] her but many of you have heard me tell
[1:41:20] the
[1:41:21] story that before I married her and I
[1:41:24] was a
[1:41:25] sinner I told her I would not marry her
[1:41:28] until I told her my
[1:41:30] life I didn't know brother brandham and
[1:41:32] what he Ted I was just an honest human
[1:41:37] being I wanted her to know what she was
[1:41:40] marrying and I told her the girls and
[1:41:44] the problems I'd had in
[1:41:48] life and I said you don't have to tell
[1:41:50] me nothing
[1:41:51] nothing cuz I never put her to a
[1:41:55] test I was marrying her because I loved
[1:41:58] her Jesus Christ don't put us to its
[1:42:03] head to see whether or not we're
[1:42:09] bride he loves
[1:42:11] us he may have to chasen us yet
[1:42:15] right me and my wife have been it's been
[1:42:18] a wonderful situation in life but we've
[1:42:19] had our problems
[1:42:21] and I had to chasen her she had to
[1:42:23] chasen me of course most of you men
[1:42:25] don't agree with that side of
[1:42:29] it that she's chasing me a whole
[1:42:32] lot that's not part of whether or not
[1:42:35] that's CZ she loves
[1:42:39] me cuz you wanted me to do
[1:42:41] right the bride don't have to wait to
[1:42:44] learn if you get what I'm talking about
[1:42:47] before God ever started the church agj
[1:42:50] is to write what they were about now the
[1:42:53] first church age begun about ad 95 oh
[1:42:57] excuse
[1:42:58] me
[1:43:00] ad50 first church age started about ad50
[1:43:04] all now this is about
[1:43:08] 9596 and John is
[1:43:11] shown how beautiful the bride
[1:43:14] looks that she's standing you can't
[1:43:18] separate her from him
[1:43:24] go over in Revelations what is it 21 22
[1:43:27] the coming of the
[1:43:29] city and look what John talks about he
[1:43:32] describes the city coming down he
[1:43:34] describes it as a bride he describes the
[1:43:37] bride coming as the
[1:43:39] city really
[1:43:43] right because it's just
[1:43:46] Alik who is this standing
[1:43:49] here all almighty
[1:43:52] God but in his bride
[1:43:55] form to show how much he loves
[1:43:59] her and he's already taken before we
[1:44:01] started our church age of the seventh
[1:44:04] age God had already showed how beautiful
[1:44:07] we are
[1:44:11] amen before he wrote anything about all
[1:44:14] of the bad stuff of the lady of see in
[1:44:15] age he's already showed the bride how
[1:44:17] good she
[1:44:19] is why can't you read the Bible like
[1:44:22] that
[1:44:23] sometime you want to see yourself read
[1:44:25] the book of
[1:44:26] Revelation and see what God thinks about
[1:44:31] you is it not in the church ages where
[1:44:33] the Prophet would cover how they Washed
[1:44:35] by the blood how they T's nothing what
[1:44:37] is Page 31 Church AG book if we accept
[1:44:40] the fact that Jesus Christ died for us
[1:44:42] we must accept the fact that we're just
[1:44:44] as righteous as God is I'm quoting from
[1:44:46] page 31 Church A's book he said to
[1:44:48] reject one is to reject the other y
[1:44:50] that's if you reject the fact that you
[1:44:52] are just as righteous as God is you are
[1:44:55] rejecting the new birth that he gave
[1:44:57] you right that's what your Prophet said
[1:45:03] amen but she goes to shows already all
[1:45:07] the way to the white
[1:45:09] throne and her sitting on the
[1:45:13] throne a beautiful
[1:45:16] picture come on Brothers a beautiful
[1:45:19] picture
[1:45:24] all the way over to the Lord's
[1:45:28] day when the days of man is over
[1:45:33] with he shows that before we ever
[1:45:35] started the ages what he thought about
[1:45:38] the bride that would be in the
[1:45:40] ages now let me ask you a final
[1:45:44] question if God already saw
[1:45:49] us
[1:45:51] the bride you know around the world the
[1:45:53] bride then is there any way that we can
[1:45:56] ever keep from coming to
[1:46:01] that I mean there any way you can keep
[1:46:03] from coming from what God already knowed
[1:46:04] about
[1:46:07] you I'm serious I want to know is there
[1:46:10] any way that you would not come to that
[1:46:13] I mean God have you ever seen
[1:46:15] anything God come down today brother
[1:46:18] colie and he show you tomorrow at 12:00
[1:46:20] well you know what in a way the world
[1:46:22] can end I don't care how many Adam bombs
[1:46:23] they drop I don't care what they do it
[1:46:25] can't end at 12:00 on the sure even
[1:46:27] going to be
[1:46:31] 12:00 he's already showed the bride and
[1:46:34] how perfect she is
[1:46:39] amen you know I'm about ready to accept
[1:46:42] the fact that that's talking about
[1:46:44] us you know that brother brandham never
[1:46:46] called you bride now don't misunderstand
[1:46:49] me he used the word bride in many forms
[1:46:52] back before the seals broke but when he
[1:46:54] come into the seals he got over so far
[1:46:57] he said I call you
[1:47:00] bride he had never said that before he
[1:47:04] talked to the
[1:47:06] church he had used the word bride but he
[1:47:08] never said I call you bride until the
