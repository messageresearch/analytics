[2:01] that over in glory
[2:03] man hey man i can hear myself
[2:08] it's on the little button
[2:12] okay i'll turn it the other way then
[2:14] how's that
[2:16] you put a battery in i didn't touch it

[2:24] but i can hear myself it's all good
[2:28] how's everybody just hang on to that
[2:29] while i get your battery oh sure
[2:31] yeah it doesn't work without one but
[2:33] nobody said put one in it
[2:36] it's a pleasure to be here with you as
[2:39] always i want to thank brother samuel
[2:41] for allowing me to come by and visit
[2:42] with them
[2:44] family and for treating me so kindly and
[2:47] more family
[2:48] and well i feel like i am but uh we're
[2:51] all family amen
[2:53] and that's the reason why that i gave
[2:55] the title to the message this evening
[2:57] who are we
[2:58] amen do you know who you are come on
[3:01] well you can tell me your name and you
[3:02] can tell me where you were born
[3:04] and and you can tell me the day you were
[3:06] born and maybe the hour you were born
[3:08] and the sign you were born under the
[3:09] hospital you were born in and the state
[3:11] you were born in town you were born in
[3:13] but
[3:13] you still don't know who you are until
[3:16] god comes into your life
[3:18] when he comes into your life then he
[3:20] begins to tell you
[3:23] if you'll receive it who you are
[3:27] amen so let's just see how this works if
[3:29] you would with me i want you to turn to
[3:31] romans
[3:32] uh by the way i have to
[3:36] i know i wasn't i got to leave right
[3:39] after service because i got to drive
[3:40] nearly back to charlotte tonight
[3:42] to catch an airplane in the morning to
[3:44] go home so i want you to pray for me for
[3:47] traveling mercies and
[3:48] i'll be shaking hands or fist bumping
[3:51] her elbow
[3:52] whatever we're doing it right right on
[3:54] out the door
[3:55] so i don't want anybody to be upset that
[3:57] i didn't stick around in fellowship
[3:59] which doesn't seem like you're doing
[4:01] anyway
[4:02] so everything's good i asked the brother
[4:05] if he wanted me to preach with a mask on
[4:07] and he said nope couldn't hear you
[4:09] so i'm i'm pretty free right now how
[4:12] about
[4:12] romans chapter eight if you would i know
[4:15] it's a real familiar to everybody but
[4:17] i believe it kind of gives us a a lift
[4:20] an edge up verse 14
[4:22] on uh who we are now of course
[4:27] god can tell you who you are every day
[4:31] but if you never believe what he tells
[4:33] you then you're never going to know who
[4:35] you
[4:36] are there's got to come a point in time
[4:39] where you begin to receive what god is
[4:42] telling you you've got to receive it
[4:44] into your heart
[4:45] and then you've got to start to believe
[4:47] it and once you begin to start to
[4:50] believe it then
[4:51] whoa the devil's going to get lit up
[4:53] he's not going to leave you alone
[4:55] he's going to try to make you change
[4:57] your mind
[4:58] and he has tactics for doing that so
[5:01] we'll start out sharing some of those
[5:03] before we get into the good part
[5:06] verse 14 of romans 8 is four as many
[5:10] as are led by the spirit of god
[5:13] they are the sons of god
[5:16] for you have not received the spirit of
[5:18] bondage
[5:19] again to fear but ye have received the
[5:22] spirit of adoption
[5:24] whereby we cry abba father
[5:28] the spirit itself beareth witness with
[5:30] our spirit that we
[5:32] are who are we the
[5:35] children of god and if children
[5:39] watch it now this is really going to
[5:41] tell us who we are
[5:43] it's going to tell us where we came from
[5:46] how we got there
[5:47] and where we're going then heirs
[5:50] heirs of god oh i like
[5:54] that and joint
[5:57] heirs with christ if so be that we
[6:02] suffer with him that we may als be also
[6:05] glorified
[6:07] together so there is some suffering that
[6:09] comes
[6:10] with being an heir of god and joint
[6:14] heirs with christ but there's a purpose
[6:17] behind
[6:17] it for i reckon that the sufferings of
[6:20] this present time are not worthy
[6:23] [Laughter]
[6:25] oh look at where we're at right now you
[6:28] think you're suffering
[6:29] they're not worthy to be compared with
[6:31] the glory
[6:33] watch it now i'm going to throw your
[6:35] curveball which shall be revealed
[6:37] to us that's not what it says
[6:42] it doesn't say for us because of us
[6:46] it says in amen
[6:50] exactly i want everybody from in the
[6:52] sound of my voice to realize
[6:54] how important you really are
[6:57] to the economy of god don't let satan
[7:00] tell you nothing else and he's gonna try
[7:05] just don't receive it you're still with
[7:07] me
[7:09] for the earnest expectation of the
[7:12] creature
[7:13] or creation waiteth for the
[7:16] manifestation of the sons of god
[7:20] for the creature of creation was made
[7:22] subject to vanity
[7:23] not willingly but by reason of him who
[7:27] hath subjected the same in hope
[7:29] because the creation or creature itself
[7:33] also shall be delivered from the bondage
[7:36] of corruption into the glorious liberty
[7:39] of the children of god paul's going
[7:41] somewhere now
[7:43] if you're old and broken down paul's
[7:46] going somewhere
[7:48] if you're young and you're wondering
[7:50] where you're going paul's going
[7:52] somewhere with this
[7:55] i like it for we know that the whole
[7:59] creation groaneth
[8:00] and travaileth in pain together until
[8:03] now
[8:03] right amen and not only they
[8:07] but ourselves also which have the first
[8:09] fruits of the spirit
[8:11] even we ourselves grown within ourselves
[8:15] oh brother sister
[8:19] if you wasn't groaning six months ago
[8:20] you're groaning now
[8:23] waiting for the adoption to with the
[8:25] redemption
[8:27] of our body let's pray father
[8:30] we love you so much lord that we don't
[8:33] have the vocabulary we don't have the
[8:35] energy lord
[8:37] we don't have the ambition in this body
[8:41] to begin to be able to express it lord
[8:44] but you
[8:44] have a body waiting for us lord where
[8:48] the energy
[8:50] and the ambition and the expression will
[8:52] come through
[8:54] but father first there's something that
[8:56] needs to be done
[8:58] and lord i believe with all my heart by
[9:00] the signs of the time
[9:02] and by your word itself lord that we are
[9:05] now
[9:06] standing on the threshold each and every
[9:09] one of us lord
[9:10] of the most glorious time
[9:14] in the scriptures it don't look good
[9:17] right now
[9:18] we might not feel good right now lord
[9:21] we're being quarantined and put upon
[9:24] lord they're forcing us to do things
[9:27] that we don't believe we should have to
[9:28] do
[9:29] but father they haven't asked us yet
[9:32] what we believe we believe you
[9:36] we love you we give you all the honor
[9:39] and the glory and the praise father
[9:42] because of it in jesus christ's name
[9:45] and god's children said amen amen you
[9:48] may be seated
[9:50] now brothers and sisters i've been
[9:51] preaching on a series i've talked to
[9:53] brother wade and uh
[9:54] uh i talked to brother samuel brother
[9:56] samuel is preaching to you on the
[9:57] godhead
[9:59] you got to know the godhead because you
[10:02] got to know who you serve
[10:04] he's not two or three or five or ten
[10:06] gods he's not a lot of idols he's one
[10:08] god
[10:09] he's a jealous god and he'll have no
[10:10] other gods before him
[10:13] but he did decide
[10:16] on a plan whereby he would condense and
[10:20] down
[10:20] out of no beginning and no end right
[10:24] no sickness no time nothing but
[10:28] euphoria and pleasure and and and and
[10:32] and so forth and so on all the
[10:34] adjectives you could put to it and he
[10:35] said to himself
[10:37] i got to express my attributes it's got
[10:39] to be done
[10:41] i've got a plan to do it he said but
[10:44] it's going to require me
[10:46] to step out watch now
[10:50] of normal listen to the phrases now
[10:54] and it's going to be a new normal right
[10:56] [Laughter]
[10:58] because that's what they're putting on
[10:59] us right now but it's satan's eden
[11:01] that's impressing it see
[11:03] now remember satan can't be joy and
[11:06] peace and love and
[11:08] and long-suffering and happiness and
[11:10] patience and so forth
[11:11] so his kingdom is just the opposite it's
[11:14] hate
[11:15] it's bitterness fighting
[11:19] arguing disagreeing and it all ends up
[11:22] in death
[11:24] can you imagine a king over a kingdom
[11:27] and his responsibility as king is to see
[11:31] to it that all his conscious
[11:32] constituents die
[11:36] then he won't have a kingdom what kind
[11:38] of a king is that
[11:40] that's the devil he just doesn't know
[11:43] any better
[11:44] but god through his pleasure and good
[11:48] will
[11:49] has decided in the hour you and i live
[11:51] in to send us
[11:53] a prophet
[11:57] and i don't believe these are the words
[11:59] of william branham you can put that on
[12:01] there if you want to but
[12:02] i believe that the words of god through
[12:04] william branham
[12:06] believe that with all my heart and
[12:08] brothers and sisters i don't believe
[12:10] god wanted it to stop there with the
[12:11] prophet
[12:13] or i believe the prophet would still be
[12:14] with us what god intended was for
[12:17] every one of his attributes which would
[12:19] become his children
[12:21] heirs of god joint heirs with christ you
[12:24] see
[12:25] to begin to manifest his plan
[12:29] now i like to explain it like this i i
[12:32] told brother wade as he's preaching on
[12:34] the two spirits and that's very
[12:36] important
[12:37] i mention it all the time when i'm
[12:39] ministering because brothers and sisters
[12:41] we need to recognize our enemy
[12:45] now if you want to see your enemy
[12:48] don't you go looking around you just
[12:51] grab the mirror
[12:54] and take a peek we are our own
[12:57] worst enemy now there is a man on the
[12:59] inside
[13:01] who's going to have to fight the man on
[13:03] the outside
[13:05] what is he fighting for he's fighting
[13:07] for his own territory
[13:09] we are fighting the devil that took a
[13:12] perfectly good body and began to break
[13:15] it down
[13:20] and corrupt it he took
[13:23] he took the immortal and he began to
[13:25] bring it into mortality now
[13:27] god all along knew it was gonna happen
[13:30] and you might wonder why like a lot of
[13:33] people who aren't sure what they believe
[13:35] think of god and why is all
[13:39] this happening
[13:44] well i like to say it like this
[13:48] before there was a molecule
[13:51] before there was light or darkness
[13:55] probably we were told it was darkness
[14:00] god was alone with his thoughts
[14:04] you with me do you believe this
[14:08] it's what the prophet taught us and i
[14:09] believe it god was alone with his
[14:11] thoughts
[14:13] so in one sense he wasn't alone
[14:18] you know how it is when you feel all
[14:19] alone
[14:21] you're not really all alone
[14:24] but god was gonna give birth
[14:30] to himself
[14:33] and inside of him there were attributes
[14:37] that he
[14:38] just wanted to display
[14:42] and to manifest but in the world that
[14:46] our god lived in there was no sickness
[14:51] there was no need there was no want
[14:56] there was no poverty
[15:01] everything was perfect
[15:05] now how is a perfect god
[15:09] gonna develop a plan
[15:13] whereby he would have to come down and
[15:16] pay the price for
[15:17] imperfection when there was no
[15:20] imperfection
[15:23] i want you to know who you are i want
[15:26] you to know why you're here
[15:29] if you listen for a few minutes it might
[15:32] come to you
[15:36] think about it perfect god
[15:40] perfect place perfect peace
[15:45] perfect health there was nothing amiss
[15:49] does that sound good especially right
[15:53] now
[15:54] in 2020 amidst all the chaos that's
[15:58] going on in the world
[16:00] i hope everybody is not naive enough to
[16:03] think this is only happening in this
[16:04] country
[16:05] this is happening all over the world
[16:09] and there is a reason for it because
[16:11] satan
[16:13] is afraid what's he afraid of
[16:17] he's afraid of the manifestation of the
[16:22] sons of
[16:23] god why is he afraid of it
[16:27] because in genesis 1 26 7-8 he said
[16:30] god said let us make man brother wade
[16:36] kind of shared with me a little bit of
[16:38] the
[16:39] focus of of the messages he's been
[16:41] preaching on and it just tied right in
[16:43] with the thoughts i already had written
[16:45] down
[16:46] let us make man and lucifer's like yeah
[16:49] come on and he just
[16:52] come on let's do it and god said
[16:56] sorry pardon
[17:00] you're not in us
[17:05] let us make man
[17:08] now i could take hours and hours on this
[17:10] but i'm going to cut to the quick on
[17:12] that one
[17:13] that is he's still
[17:16] making man amen oh yeah did you realize
[17:20] that
[17:20] what when god said it brother bradham
[17:23] said it's
[17:24] as if it was a finished work i believe
[17:27] that with all my heart
[17:28] but guess what he also said it could
[17:30] take a billion years
[17:33] for it to come to pass because when god
[17:36] says something now he don't look over
[17:37] his shoulder
[17:39] hmm i wonder if it's going to come to
[17:41] pass or not he don't even
[17:43] it doesn't even cross his mind
[17:48] but this same god you and i serve i want
[17:50] to i want you to see
[17:52] how he got
[17:56] his plan in motion glory the way he got
[17:59] his plan
[18:00] in motion is god was alone with his
[18:03] attributes and guess who his attributes
[18:05] are
[18:07] his children so god was alone with the
[18:11] heirs of an inheritance that he was
[18:14] going to give
[18:17] let us make manny set
[18:20] praise the lord all of his attributes
[18:23] were just praising the lord
[18:26] and we didn't feel as if it was
[18:28] necessary when he made the statement
[18:31] like lucifer did that
[18:32] wow man we got to get in on this
[18:35] the way that his attributes viewed as
[18:38] the father was
[18:41] we're going to stand back and watch him
[18:42] do it
[18:44] huh that's what the bible teaches
[18:47] us let go and let god
[18:51] but if you let go far enough
[18:55] here's what'll begin to happen hmm
[18:59] god doesn't have anybody who's sick
[19:03] our father doesn't have anybody who's
[19:06] lost
[19:08] right
[19:11] could we be of service perhaps
[19:15] think about it you never were sick
[19:19] you're not lost you didn't have a need
[19:23] but a
[19:24] signal a thought came
[19:28] from that great source right we call our
[19:31] father amen
[19:33] and that signal was i have a plan
[19:38] i'm going to express myself i'm a savior
[19:43] i'm a healer i'm a provider
[19:48] and there was silence
[19:51] until one at least
[19:54] one of those attributes
[19:57] that was in god
[20:01] said i'll go yeah i don't know what it's
[20:05] like to be sick
[20:07] i don't know what it's like to have a
[20:09] need i don't know what it's like to be
[20:12] lost
[20:15] but if he needs somebody here am i lord
[20:19] send me
[20:21] i want you to see how the attributes of
[20:24] god work
[20:25] brothers and sisters because if we in
[20:28] fact are his children and he was going
[20:30] to employ
[20:31] this plan with his attributes
[20:34] then what do his attributes know
[20:38] they never had a beginning and they'll
[20:41] never have an
[20:42] end and if they lay their life down
[20:46] it can be picked up again
[20:49] if they get sick he's a healer if they
[20:53] get lost he's a founder
[20:55] if they have a need he's a provider you
[20:58] with me
[20:59] that's the god we serve and that's who
[21:03] we are
[21:05] we are his children
[21:08] and we have been given to understand
[21:10] that he won't lose
[21:12] one of us because all that the father
[21:16] has given me
[21:18] he said will come to me and i won't lose
[21:20] one
[21:21] amen are you with me do you believe that
[21:25] or are you on the fringe trying to still
[21:27] figure out
[21:29] how it's going to get done brothers and
[21:32] sisters if you can see the time we live
[21:34] in we're moving past that
[21:36] we're going to get to a time we're
[21:37] already to this part of the scripture
[21:39] where they would believe a lie and be
[21:42] damned by it
[21:44] why that's all about we're getting amen
[21:47] can you imagine it it's lie after lie
[21:51] after lie after lying after a while it's
[21:54] like i guess we're used to it now
[21:57] so we'll go along with it not the
[22:00] children of god
[22:02] all right still with me all right well
[22:06] let me turn the corner and let's see how
[22:08] we got a clock
[22:10] okay good because i'll i'll get lost
[22:14] you know a few years ago i couldn't even
[22:16] preach a couple hours at the
[22:18] at the watch night i'll keep you up till
[22:22] tomorrow morning if you'd like
[22:24] but brothers and sisters there's there's
[22:26] something happening to us there's a
[22:28] there's a transition taking place i've
[22:30] been preaching on a series of messages
[22:32] called the claim
[22:33] and i'm at the point in that mess in
[22:35] that series where it's a transfer
[22:38] right there's a transfer going on
[22:42] that's where we're at right now but i'd
[22:44] like to paint a small picture
[22:46] of how we got to this point and that is
[22:48] satan i want you to think about the day
[22:50] we live in
[22:52] satan is his tactic
[22:56] since the garden of eden was to
[22:58] interrupt
[23:00] excuse me hath not god's dead
[23:05] excuse me hath god not said
[23:09] listen listen careful watch the two
[23:11] spirits right
[23:12] hath god not sin
[23:16] think about it and he keeps repeating it
[23:19] and repeating it
[23:20] and repeating it and repeating it and
[23:21] after he thinks he's lulled you into uh
[23:24] yeah god said that yeah he throws he
[23:27] throws a word in there that don't belong
[23:30] think about it i mean we read in the
[23:32] bible here where it's just two or three
[23:33] sentences but
[23:34] i'm going to tell you something that
[23:37] serpent
[23:38] had been working on eve for quite some
[23:41] time
[23:42] you got to remember there was no clock
[23:44] before there's no calendar
[23:45] there was no months no days no years
[23:49] science has put that on it but up to
[23:52] that time
[23:53] who knows how long it was
[23:56] he couldn't get to adam we're told
[23:59] so he decided that he'd work on what he
[24:02] considered to be a weakness
[24:06] think about it do you know in the
[24:09] message marriage in divorce brother
[24:11] branham said
[24:12] satan designed a woman he couldn't
[24:16] create
[24:17] right rather wait he couldn't create
[24:20] and he kept moping around and moping
[24:23] around
[24:23] and moping around because he couldn't
[24:25] create and he couldn't make a man
[24:29] and he kept begging
[24:33] god said tell you what lucifer
[24:37] i'll grant you this i'm gonna let you
[24:41] design the woman
[24:43] i'm repeating what the prophet said you
[24:44] go to the marriage and divorce message
[24:46] and listen i'll let you design the woman
[24:50] and right there satan believed he had
[24:53] his way in
[24:55] i can't create her but i'll designer and
[24:57] i know a lot about anatomy
[25:00] i know a lot about botany i know a lot
[25:03] about biology
[25:04] i know a lot about reproduction i know a
[25:08] lot about and he said i'll make a woman
[25:11] and he didn't create her now he said but
[25:14] i'll design her
[25:17] and she'll have a flaw we're not
[25:20] speaking to you sisters you understand
[25:22] that
[25:22] we're talking about how god god didn't
[25:26] did does anybody in here think god
[25:28] designed something with the flaw
[25:33] then don't think so poorly of yourself
[25:39] yes because of the fall
[25:42] there's this exterior crust
[25:46] boy you want to talk about fall i can
[25:49] barely pick myself up
[25:52] but there's a man on the inside
[25:55] by a new birth that has been informed
[25:59] through the genetics of that new birth
[26:01] that we
[26:02] are so much more hey man
[26:05] than we know you know we had to bypass
[26:09] our theophany to get to this point
[26:12] god knew that and guess what that's not
[26:15] a problem
[26:17] because by the word of god and the
[26:20] receiving of the word of god you've been
[26:22] given to understand that you can make
[26:24] connection with that theophany
[26:26] anytime you want you're still with me
[26:31] so satan's interruption i've got this
[26:35] written down on my notes is
[26:37] the attempt in the garden of eden
[26:41] by satan was to interrupt the word of
[26:44] god
[26:45] now when god said let us make man in our
[26:48] image and after our likeness
[26:50] all right we're given to understand that
[26:53] at the end of the next verse that he
[26:55] made
[26:55] man both male and female is that right
[26:58] now now
[26:59] satan couldn't interrupt that part
[27:02] because he can't interrupt god
[27:06] but the attributes of god that let us
[27:08] make
[27:09] man in our image and after our likeness
[27:12] were given a mandate in order
[27:15] they were given a promise and that
[27:17] promise was to replenish
[27:19] and multiply and you see where satan got
[27:21] in
[27:23] he said i see my way in now i will
[27:26] inject myself
[27:28] between let us make man and
[27:31] the production
[27:34] of that spoken word
[27:38] all right think about think of where
[27:40] we're at right now
[27:42] we are doing everything we can to
[27:45] accomplish
[27:46] genesis 1 26 and 27
[27:50] we want to be in the image and after the
[27:52] likeness of god
[27:54] come on amen let's just be honest
[27:58] but satan has injected himself he's
[28:00] interrupted the
[28:02] stream but god knew he was going to do
[28:05] it
[28:06] how did god know he was going to do it
[28:08] because of his foreknowledge
[28:09] but even better than that because god
[28:11] said hey you go ahead and design the
[28:13] woman
[28:15] you see because god could not
[28:18] be god could not be perfect
[28:22] could not be the god that we know that
[28:25] he is
[28:27] and make anything right that had a flaw
[28:33] but he had a right-hand man
[28:38] who he brought into existence
[28:41] what's the term they use that that that
[28:44] people like to use for the woman
[28:46] by product guess what lucifer is
[28:51] [Laughter]
[28:52] he's a by product
[28:56] because the product is of the original
[28:59] seed
[29:01] you're with me all right so satan has
[29:04] attempted to
[29:05] inject himself into
[29:10] god's word and the reason why i
[29:13] read romans 8 is because
[29:16] the gap between genesis 1 26
[29:20] 7 and between there and 28
[29:24] is the manifestation of the sons of god
[29:29] you see what he did is he jumped in
[29:31] there and he injected himself before
[29:33] the sons of god could manifest
[29:36] themselves
[29:37] because in order to replenish and
[29:38] multiply you have to have an original
[29:43] is that right i love
[29:46] god's plan i love god's plan
[29:50] it comes down to something so simple
[29:54] that the wise and the prudent the highly
[29:57] academic and educated not speaking
[29:59] against your education that's not where
[30:01] we're at
[30:03] you know people misunderstand education
[30:05] you get an education so you can be
[30:07] better at what you're going to do
[30:09] whenever you get there to do it
[30:11] but you go into the educational system
[30:13] of the
[30:14] last century and this one and they are
[30:17] manipulating the minds
[30:19] of children and then they begin to
[30:21] manipulate the minds of young adults and
[30:23] then they begin to manipulate the minds
[30:26] of adults it ain't about learning
[30:31] it's about turning yeah you understand
[30:34] that and that's why i believe the
[30:36] prophet of god spoke against that
[30:37] because he understood
[30:38] the spirit on the system
[30:42] it's not the learning don't ever think
[30:45] that
[30:46] even the prophet of god said he didn't
[30:47] want anybody to be ignorant or dumb or
[30:49] that's not why he was saying it
[30:52] he understood the influence of another
[30:56] still with me so i i read this i wrote
[31:00] this down
[31:01] as i move forward satan's attempt to
[31:03] keep the sons of god to manifest and you
[31:06] know what the word manifest means
[31:08] to show up to appear
[31:11] to come into full existence see where he
[31:14] got in
[31:16] and now brothers and sisters i'm
[31:18] preaching on this for one reason because
[31:20] now we've come to the time where
[31:23] there's a corner has turned and satan
[31:27] now
[31:27] is up against something he's never come
[31:29] up against
[31:30] and that is a woman
[31:34] that he did not design amen
[31:36] [Laughter]
[31:39] he's come up against the bride of christ
[31:42] who was not something separate or
[31:45] different
[31:46] or a byproduct of the spirit of god
[31:49] but in fact it was the feminine part of
[31:52] god
[31:54] brother branham said in one place god
[31:56] don't run his business like we do
[31:59] he kept his feminine part to himself
[32:04] why because inside of that special place
[32:09] that you and i call the bride god
[32:12] kept the information
[32:17] that was necessary and needed
[32:20] to bring his plan full circle
[32:24] after he after he's already manifested
[32:28] himself as a healer and a savior and a
[32:30] provider and
[32:32] you go down the list of jehovah jairus
[32:35] and rafa's he said now it's time
[32:40] there's come a time when now i've got to
[32:43] close the gap
[32:45] i've got to push the devil out
[32:49] and here's what's fantastic god's using
[32:52] me and you to do it
[32:55] why because he wants us to know we're a
[32:58] part of the god that can do
[33:00] it it's nothing for you and i to sit
[33:04] back and say let god do it let god do it
[33:06] let god do it
[33:07] you know i come from the west to forgive
[33:09] me i know i'm on the stream
[33:10] everybody's preaching the return of
[33:12] william branham why
[33:16] because they can't seem to get past a
[33:19] point
[33:20] where they're not manifesting a part of
[33:22] the word that they can read
[33:24] and they can intellectually conceive but
[33:26] they just can't seem to get it done
[33:30] therefore we'll step back and we'll wait
[33:33] until the prophet comes to do it because
[33:35] we can't seem to manage it
[33:39] it's in the bride but you got to believe
[33:43] that it's in there
[33:44] right you've got to receive it and then
[33:46] you've got to
[33:48] put it into practice
[33:52] don't we live in a time when practice
[33:55] will make perfect do you know how
[33:59] important we are
[34:01] i i mean it don't shirk back
[34:06] you know how important we are everybody
[34:09] that's gone on before us
[34:12] who we who we understand is beyond the
[34:14] curtain of time and they don't sweat
[34:16] they don't have to take a shower and
[34:18] they don't eat and they don't get
[34:19] thirsty
[34:20] and they get to hug each other and an
[34:22] old precious brother even the
[34:24] prophet he's waiting
[34:30] on someone now brothers and sisters why
[34:33] can't it be or not
[34:36] it surely can be all you've got to do
[34:39] is make your calling and election sure
[34:44] now you say wait a minute brother
[34:45] election that's right that's
[34:47] predestination
[34:48] now i see right now that we don't got to
[34:50] do nothing because god's already done it
[34:52] for us i'll tell you what god done for
[34:53] us
[34:56] prophet of god said the devil voted for
[34:59] us
[35:01] god voted for us who are you voting for
[35:06] you see election now it's your choice
[35:09] he put you and me on free moral
[35:12] agency now when god says free moral
[35:14] agency he means it
[35:18] he didn't have to do like the israelite
[35:21] priest did after years went by of
[35:23] nonchalant and
[35:24] casual going into the holiest of holies
[35:27] he didn't have to tie a rope to us
[35:30] that's right because if we come from him
[35:34] amen we're going back to it brothers and
[35:36] sisters and we live in the hour right
[35:38] now where it's time for you and i
[35:41] to lay down the nonsense oh i don't mean
[35:44] you have to become
[35:45] some kind of religious zealot and get a
[35:47] soapbox and go down to gainesville and
[35:49] get on the street corner and start
[35:50] shouting no
[35:51] it's time for you and i to take the
[35:53] devil
[35:55] and put him where he belongs
[35:59] where does he belong not in us
[36:05] we've got to get him out and guess what
[36:08] god
[36:09] gave you and i the authority to do run
[36:12] him off
[36:13] amen how do you do it resist
[36:16] the devil and you don't even got to
[36:19] chase him
[36:20] he will flee
[36:24] that's where we're at brothers and
[36:25] sisters and what's going on in this day
[36:28] and age is
[36:29] exactly i'll read i'll read a quote to
[36:32] you
[36:32] brother you can bring up the one on page
[36:34] 104 paragraph 19
[36:37] uh of adoption
[36:41] brother wade made fun of me for bringing
[36:44] my books
[36:48] i ain't got the hang of that tablet yet
[36:51] ain't got the hang of that their laptop
[36:53] but what i did tell him is who are we
[36:57] look did you realize that the prophet of
[37:00] god said that
[37:02] in the back of god's mind he kept
[37:05] the final secrets
[37:09] and brother branham used the word hid
[37:13] h i d
[37:16] guess where the word hid came from it
[37:20] came from the word
[37:21] hide now you're thinking you mean like
[37:25] hide and seek nope that's not where it
[37:27] came from
[37:27] it came from the word hide like as in
[37:30] leather skin you see
[37:34] god's secrets are being kept in you and
[37:36] i
[37:37] and the reason why some of us don't know
[37:40] who we are yet
[37:41] is because we're supposed to be tested
[37:43] and tried and proven
[37:46] and then you begin to release that like
[37:49] a time
[37:50] capsule you know the pill you take with
[37:53] the little colored grains in it and one
[37:55] goes off in one hour and one and two and
[37:56] one and three
[37:57] and one in five hours and then 12 hour
[37:59] relief
[38:01] well this is lifetime relief this is
[38:04] starting to go
[38:05] off in you and i and something is coming
[38:08] to
[38:08] us and this is what brother branham said
[38:11] tell me my brother
[38:12] tell me my sister when was the time that
[38:16] the sons of god was ever
[38:18] to be manifested outside of this time
[38:21] now amen
[38:25] he's asking a question tell me
[38:29] when was there ever a time in the
[38:31] history
[38:33] those that manifest the time to deliver
[38:37] our nature
[38:41] nature the nature itself is groaning
[38:43] waiting for the time of the
[38:44] manifestation why
[38:47] before the atonement was made before the
[38:49] holy ghost was ever poured out
[38:51] before all the old testament on down
[38:53] there there couldn't have been a
[38:54] manifestation
[38:55] it had to wait till this time
[38:59] now all things has been brought coming
[39:01] shaping up to a headstone
[39:03] to a manifestation of sons of god coming
[39:06] back
[39:08] see the connection coming back
[39:12] full circle all right and the spirit of
[39:15] god coming into these man
[39:18] so perfectly until
[39:21] their ministry will be so close like
[39:26] christ
[39:26] till it will join him and his church
[39:30] together do you realize brothers and
[39:32] sisters this is where we're
[39:34] at this is happening right now
[39:39] but the devil has to put a stop to it
[39:42] why because he realizes that once
[39:46] the claim is taken
[39:49] listen now about the pawn shop i'm just
[39:52] going to freelance from here on out
[39:55] because i'm getting i'm going to close
[39:59] brother branham talks about the pawn
[40:01] shop is that right
[40:03] brother branham talks about the boxcar
[40:06] everybody wants to tell you
[40:08] about the boxcar analogy but they never
[40:11] seem to get to the one paragraph in
[40:14] one of the places where brother branham
[40:16] says now it's a federal offense to break
[40:18] that seal
[40:20] that's where they stop right there fell
[40:21] a little offensive but brother bradham
[40:23] said but once it goes down the line
[40:26] there is a man who's qualified
[40:29] to break that seal
[40:34] who is that man it's the man
[40:38] who's been given the authority by the
[40:41] owner of the goods in the boxcar
[40:45] to crack it open
[40:50] now that was given temporarily to a man
[40:52] named william branham
[40:55] he cracked her open the seventh seal
[40:56] opened and then
[40:58] all of a sudden it was omitted why does
[41:01] it say that
[41:02] and there's people who argue the seven
[41:04] seals open the seven seals closed
[41:06] seven seals never open well i'm gonna
[41:08] tell you what the seven seal is closed
[41:10] to those who it's close to
[41:12] and the seventh seal is open to those
[41:14] who it is open to
[41:15] it's real simple if you're inside of
[41:18] that seal if you're part of that
[41:20] seal if that seal is you make up that
[41:22] part
[41:23] amen it's open but there's a lot more to
[41:26] just the opening of a seal
[41:28] than meets the eye i can okay that door
[41:31] right there brother wait is that door
[41:32] locked
[41:33] no it's open
[41:38] looks shut to me you with me
[41:42] to most people that door is closed
[41:46] but if you have pre-knowledge
[41:50] that that door is unlocked
[41:54] it's open amen looks close to me it's
[41:57] open because i happen to know it's
[42:00] unlocked
[42:03] look up the word brothers and sisters
[42:06] that's the way god's word is
[42:09] don't look at it at face value and go oh
[42:12] woe is me
[42:14] i can't see my way through this just
[42:17] believe
[42:17] it's unlocked to you and then approach
[42:21] that door and when you get there
[42:25] it'll open but so many people draw back
[42:30] i don't know it doesn't look that way to
[42:32] me
[42:33] it's all about your perspective
[42:37] it's what you believe you see not what
[42:39] you think
[42:41] you see you still with me
[42:45] so i could i i can see now that
[42:49] what's happening to us
[42:54] is that we've been convinced and
[42:56] persuaded over time
[42:59] through the nuances and and he's really
[43:03] good at his job
[43:05] [Laughter]
[43:06] that old devil and somebody might say
[43:08] well that that old devil he
[43:11] he he's not he hasn't been speaking to
[43:12] me do you realize that you
[43:15] yourself and me i'm gonna use me as an
[43:17] example so it don't hurt your feelings
[43:19] you're looking at three kinds of
[43:21] believers
[43:23] right here this old flesh can't believe
[43:26] the bible says no matter what it's
[43:28] it's enmity between god and then there's
[43:30] a spirit
[43:31] in between this flesh and my soul that
[43:35] is trying to make up its mind
[43:38] today i feel like it tomorrow i don't
[43:41] today i believe it tomorrow i don't
[43:43] this looks good that doesn't look good
[43:46] but then there's a soul in there who has
[43:50] to take complete
[43:53] of control that spirit and after a while
[43:55] the body
[43:56] ain't got no choice but to follow that's
[43:59] what happened with abraham
[44:00] how do you think he turned young yeah
[44:04] he went on a journey god said come on
[44:08] abraham leave everything
[44:10] follow me listen now come on
[44:14] watch the day we live in where are we
[44:15] going lord
[44:20] silence
[44:22] there was silence in heaven about the
[44:24] space of heaven where are we going lord
[44:27] you read your bible and you'll find out
[44:29] that abraham didn't get spoken to
[44:31] again by god till he got to a point that
[44:35] god wanted to speak to him again
[44:37] and abraham didn't even know the place
[44:40] but when he got there
[44:41] god spoke to him and he could look and
[44:43] say that's it
[44:46] and then god would say keep going
[44:49] now i told you not to take your father i
[44:51] told you not to take your nephew
[44:53] keep going think about it
[44:56] i want everybody to think abraham was
[44:59] nuts
[45:02] to anybody that didn't know how to be
[45:05] led by the spirit
[45:07] [Laughter]
[45:08] he was an heir of god joint heir of
[45:11] christ
[45:12] and he just walked he didn't sit around
[45:15] and mope he didn't cry he didn't pout
[45:18] he made a lot of mistakes along the way
[45:22] but not the kind that embarrassed god
[45:27] you understand brothers and sisters
[45:29] begin to differentiate between
[45:32] who you are and who the devil's trying
[45:35] to make you
[45:37] it's very very important but i'm going
[45:40] to finish with the pawn shop
[45:45] if you take something to the pawn shop
[45:48] and i know nobody in here has ever done
[45:50] that
[45:52] nobody's ever gotten that hard up
[45:54] nobody's ever had a need that great
[45:58] right but if you haven't you'll
[46:01] understand the pawn shop and how it
[46:03] operates right
[46:05] you need some money and you've got
[46:06] something of value and you go down there
[46:08] and they give you pennies on the dollar
[46:10] for its worth
[46:11] hoping you'll never come you'll make
[46:13] about 10 or 12 payments on it
[46:15] to try to keep it yours and then you'll
[46:18] fall out
[46:19] and they got lots of money for something
[46:21] they paid very little for
[46:23] and now they put it up for sale you
[46:26] understand
[46:27] it's a racket well
[46:30] we've been put in the pawn shop is that
[46:33] right
[46:34] by the fall in the garden of eden
[46:38] we all got some kind of slip saying
[46:40] you're on the shelf
[46:43] and you're waiting for somebody to come
[46:45] and redeem you
[46:46] and by the grace of god
[46:49] jesus christ paid the price
[46:53] for every one of us to get out of the
[46:55] pawn shop is that right
[46:57] the blood of christ is still there
[47:01] ready to make a redemption but what
[47:04] brother branham taught us
[47:06] was he just paid the price he didn't
[47:08] make the claim
[47:11] what is making the claim look at how
[47:14] close it is
[47:16] jesus paid the price so
[47:19] somebody went into the pawn shop
[47:22] and paid for that item
[47:25] to come back to its original owner but
[47:28] they never
[47:29] picked the item up
[47:34] and jesus christ paid it and he give
[47:37] each and
[47:38] every one of us a slip that says
[47:41] paige you are
[47:44] free
[47:48] but guess what hardly anybody went back
[47:51] into the pawn shop
[47:52] with the slip of paper and said i
[47:56] want what's mine amen
[47:59] that's making the claim you have got to
[48:03] make the claim today
[48:05] that what he paid for is not
[48:08] only yours but you
[48:13] as he paid the price for you and i to
[48:16] get
[48:16] out of the pawn shop but we're still
[48:20] in it
[48:23] because we have to take
[48:26] the price that was paid return
[48:30] to the scene of the crime and enforce it
[48:35] that's what god is expecting you and i
[48:37] to do
[48:38] in this day and no one else has been
[48:41] paul saw it could be done brother
[48:44] branham began the process
[48:46] but every one of us that's in this
[48:49] building and on this hookup tonight
[48:52] have the authority by god to
[48:55] take the claim and when you take the
[48:59] claim
[49:00] it's called transfer did you know that
[49:04] and i'm going to read this to you before
[49:06] i close
[49:08] now i'm going to fast forward to what to
[49:11] the lamb's book of life
[49:13] i'm going to fast forward to revelations
[49:15] 5.
[49:16] and a cry went out there's a book
[49:21] nobody can touch it nobody can open it
[49:25] i told you you and i are a book there's
[49:28] a book
[49:29] nobody can touch it nobody can open it
[49:32] nobody has access to it
[49:33] no man under the earth in the earth
[49:35] around the air no man is worthy
[49:37] right
[49:41] is that right amen and john began to
[49:42] weep brother branham said because he
[49:44] knew
[49:44] if somebody didn't step forward all
[49:47] creation was lost
[49:49] right what is creation our inheritance
[49:53] amen did you realize that that you're
[49:56] sitting on your inheritance
[49:58] you're walking on your inheritance i'm
[50:00] gonna go even further you're walking in
[50:02] your inheritance
[50:04] and it's in pretty bad shape why because
[50:07] there wasn't a place in time
[50:09] until god sent the message tell me my
[50:12] brothers
[50:13] tell me my sisters what time
[50:17] outside of this time see where we're at
[50:22] it's time to make the claim it's time to
[50:25] possess
[50:26] it's time to take back what's ours and
[50:29] it's done by a transfer
[50:32] we see it in revelations 3 21.
[50:35] i'm going to read that to you and then
[50:36] close i see it right here
[50:38] it's call i call it the royal grant to
[50:41] him that overcometh will i grant
[50:46] did you know what a grant was according
[50:48] to the dictionary
[50:50] a grant means
[50:53] to give back
[50:59] to transfer
[51:02] property by a deed
[51:08] are you going to the pawn shop with the
[51:11] deet
[51:12] you're going to the pawn shop
[51:16] to make the claim on the property
[51:19] that is all ready
[51:22] yours it's done by a transfer
[51:26] and i got to read the word take because
[51:29] what did the lamb do
[51:30] he took the book is that right
[51:34] out of the right hand of him that sat
[51:36] upon the throne wait a minute brother
[51:37] chris
[51:38] i thought that jesus and god were one
[51:40] how could there be a god on the throne
[51:43] and a god in the lamb because he's
[51:46] omnipresent
[51:50] there's only one god but he's
[51:52] omnipresent
[51:54] amen and if you only realize brothers
[51:57] and sisters
[51:58] that you and i represent something
[52:00] greater in that land than you've ever
[52:03] realized
[52:04] how do we know that because our names
[52:07] are
[52:07] written in the lamb's book of life
[52:11] and he stood up
[52:15] to take that book and the word
[52:18] take i want you to get this means to
[52:21] transfer to oneself
[52:25] wait a minute he was taking that
[52:28] book for you and i
[52:31] oh i see
[52:34] what he was doing was he was enforcing
[52:40] god's word right and in that enforcement
[52:45] it was to transfer property listen now
[52:48] to oneself
[52:52] where are we who are we amen
[52:55] did you realize brothers and sisters by
[52:57] being the bride
[52:59] of christ that we are in him
[53:03] amen who's the lamb
[53:08] where are we we are in him
[53:12] that's the only reason you and i can
[53:14] stand today amongst
[53:16] all that's going on around us even in
[53:19] our own ranks
[53:21] is we've got to realize that a transfer
[53:25] by god's word is taking place how
[53:28] by believing every word
[53:31] when you believe every word then god is
[53:34] making a transfer
[53:36] listen now to himself
[53:39] and that's where you and i am come in
[53:42] please stand oh well i give you a little
[53:46] bit to go on
[53:47] a bite of a brownie that's all i can
[53:50] afford
[53:54] i like donuts too yeah my wife's
[53:58] probably
[53:59] tuning in
[54:04] but we love him so much more
[54:07] and and brothers and sisters i know it
[54:08] sounds fantastic
[54:11] but all you've got to do is put yourself
[54:15] in a state of meditation and want from
[54:19] the lord
[54:20] and begin to not listen to the messages
[54:24] hear them lots of people are listening
[54:28] to the messages
[54:29] but very few people are hearing them and
[54:31] once i want you to understand
[54:33] something when that when a light begins
[54:36] to come on in your soul and you go
[54:38] i see that oh i see that
[54:41] oh i see that guess what that is
[54:44] that is the book in the hand of god
[54:46] beginning to reveal itself
[54:50] so it's really coming to you
[54:53] god's spirit is releasing
[54:57] the information that he's been keeping
[55:00] for eons and eons and eons of time
[55:04] to the likes of you and me gloria
[55:07] let's pray father lord i wish i could
