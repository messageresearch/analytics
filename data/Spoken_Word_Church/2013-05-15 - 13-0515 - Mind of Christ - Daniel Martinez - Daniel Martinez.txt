there that's Tim and Esther's uh pastor and Esther's dad I guess so Lord willing I'll be trying to bring the word of God down that way so you you keep me up in prayer that's that's important you know I've got a lot of prayer going out for me this morning this afternoon brother Emmanuel said he'd be praying for his so did Brother Collins and and I know I got a little wife out there that's trying to afraid that I'll I'll do okay amen and uh so be you know be patient amen I know I've got a little bit of a cold and I probably sound kind of funny but uh just be praying for me amen uh I want to talk a little bit uh let's go over in the scriptures to Philippians oh the second chapter would be in second chapter 12 verse I mean uh second chapter yes the top verse did I say the 12th verse no I'm I'm it's uh Philippians second chapter starting on the first verse okay and it's the first okay if there be any consolation con stellation in Christ if there be any consolation craft if there be any comfort of love if there obey any Fellowship of of the spirit if any bowels of mercies fulfill ye my joy that ye be like-minded having the same love being in one Accord in one of one mind let not let nothing be done through Strife or vainglory but but in the lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also in on the things of others and let this mind be in you which is also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself to no rep of no reputation and took on took him on took upon himself took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of man being found being formed in this in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto the death even the death of the cross where wherefore God also hath God also hath highly is exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that in the name of Jesus Christ every knee should bow and every of things in heaven and of things on in Earth things under the Earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father amen and now let's turn over in another scripture to Hebrews 1 and 1. and this is uh a familiar text for anybody that's in this message God who is inside God who at Sun Dry times and in diverse manners spoke in times past unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the worlds who being in the brightness of his glory and the excellent image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power then he had when when he had made by we had made by himself purged sins that down sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high being made so much better than the angels as he hath by inheritance inheritance obedient a more excellent Name than they inheritance obtained a more excellent Name than they amen now let's go over to Saint John 1 and 1. this is very familiar in the beginning was the word and the in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was gone and the same was in the beginning with God his whatever all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of man and the light shineth in dark in the in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not let's jump on over to the 14th verse of the same chapter and the Word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us and and we be beheld his glory the glory as to the only begotten son of the father so the word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us let's bar heads once again our dear Lord Jesus Lord God your word well that's true ever so true Lord Jesus and Lord as we want to consider well the the topic you know the mind of Christ and thinking Lord Jesus that you as Christ has been has revealed yourself in your own word Lord Jesus we pray O Lord God that you Feed Us Lord Jesus give us what we have need of this morning Lord God as we look into your word is things too great for us to really truly comprehend but lord it's by Revelation that you can give us each individual Lord God a a truth that you've given us in this day and age Lord not just to give us the truth Lord God but that we can just apply Our Lives to the truths that are given Lord in this day and age Lord Jesus we're so grateful for the word of God that you've departed to us this message of this hour Lord God your Prophet Lord Jesus bringing this truth Lord God that have been hidden Through the Ages Lord Jesus as we speak of things like the seals and and Lord the the different Revelations that Lord you brought to to to bring to our understanding Lord Jesus throughout all the denominal denominational ages Lord God they've probed and thought about these things Lord God throughout all time lord Jesus all the way back through the Old Testament Lord they waited and they seeked your they seek to know Your Name Lord Jesus and Lord all these things Lord God have come into a reality in this day and age Lord Jesus you revealed them to us Lord Jesus because we as your bride Lord God want to receive all that you have for us Lord God as we prepare for this day that's upon us Lord God the Rapture and the resurrection and the things that have come in Jesus Christ's name we pray bless your people amen maybe you could be seated amen you know I was uh looking at some of the things that uh that we're um where the days we're living in and and I I think a lot about the about what we should be what should be happening to this bride in this in this day and age you know and I know that you know the Bible says that there's a five-fold Ministry uh given to us for the perfecting of the Saints so I know that going to church and being where that fivefold Ministry is working is a big part of being in the position or being in my place at my time so I recognize the the work that these pastors have that these evangelists have that these that these missionaries have uh they they all have a great work and of course we do have a prophet and there are people gifted with prophecy I believe these things because they're in the word and I and I see that that we're standing in a day and age where where where we're we're looking at the at now New Beginnings we're looking at at a time that this bride should start looking for some kind of stabilization where she's she's not no longer uh moving from Pillar To Post or or questioning her her position in Christ she should be anchored and recognizing who she is and what she's doing and what kind of anointing is anointing her you know she should be recognizing the the day and hour she's living in and seeing the revealing of God's word in his day is her day recognizing that that that that that that that God's word is is is is is a lifestyle God's word is a it's not just a tradition we might not we don't come here just to to play church we come here because it's life to us you know there's an old man now uh that I knew back in the in in when I first came to this message and uh and he was going blind you know and he stood there and and he was sitting on his chair and he had he says look at my Bible and I looked at his bible and he said look I said my gosh there's big letters you know and he says you know I I I still want to read it he says and and my eyes are going so bad yeah and that says well what are you going to do brother Leo you're you're having trouble even reading these big big letters he says what are you going to do and he says Oh Brother Daniel he says this and he held up his Bible and he says this is my life I mean he put a lot of emphasis in it this is my life and I thought to myself you know well God bless you you know I said you know what I says it should be every one of us when we take a message book when we put those earbuds in our ears but we're listening to the word of God that's coming our day and age we should have that same feeling this is life to us this is we know that it's God speaking to us uh the brother in the in the uh bible study this yeah a couple uh well I got it here the the Bible study we just had here uh uh Sunday he was reading a quote where brother Branham in the in the uh Liu well let me look look hear what it is it's look look at looking at the Unseen all of a sudden brother Branham speaking not as himself but he's saying I am the Lord that raised up Christ from the grave I am the one that sent the Holy Ghost I am the one that gave the promise brother Branham has nothing to do with this I I have I have he's he's surrendered his life to me I'm using his Spirit I'm talking through his lips that's me I'm the Lord Glory I thought wow you know brother Branham many times would say I'm a minister humble as humble as he was he'd say I'm a minister you know I I I I can't call myself a prophet but yet he was able to just yield himself totally for our Lord Jesus Christ could speak through his using his voice well that's the kind of I would like to be just like that just a mouthpiece that God can use and speak to his people whatever they have need of and you know I realized that we're in a day and age when as we're coming to the to the this the coming of the Lord we're looking at a at a at Peerless times we're looking at troubles sometimes well if the government falls apart the way they're talking about it my wife was reading on her uh on her iPhone and says oh no she says the nuclear industry just fell apart I said you're not talking about the labs are you she says well it just says that and I don't know I said well read on let's just read on that's my job this is my life that's my job you're talking about oh she read on and it was something about all these uh future uh nuclear uh what do they call those uh uh where they make electricity and you they're not going to be building them now they're closing them down they're not going to let them uh build them so I said well at least they're not just turning off getting rid of all the old bombs that's my job you know and I was wondering if I was going to move to Georgia faster than I thought yeah to my my daughter she's been the City of Refuge for a long time for me and my kids yeah you know so uh so we're looking at at uh and she said well that's you know she says well if it happens well you got a place you know yeah well oh yeah he says you know what my house will be worth nothing Espanola would be a ghost town where I live because that's all the employment up there you know it's just like uh Rocky Flats you know and Boulder and all those places when they shut down the Plant there it just closed down the whole town you know so yeah it's a college town but uh it sure doesn't have the the the the finances it used to have amen and with the housing problems going on you never know what's going to happen right so now so we're bringing to a stabilization when we want to be stable we want to have the faith that was once delivered to the Saints we want to be able to look into the word of God and get some stability there because we we you know like like like Moses said one time we never passed this way before so we're looking at a at a place and and and and we look at at as as we're we're trying to get our stability and trying to understand where our position is in Christ and of course we recognize by the word of God that he's going to have a bride and we call ourselves the bride of Christ and we look at our at our it's not through anything of our natural ability but he chose us from the foundations of the world so we look at these things and we say look we know who we are we know that we're in the nervous age of Leo Josiah we know the devil's got one punch at us and we're guarding it in every way where he's got that punch coming we're trying trying to guard that you know many of us might have a little bit of arthritis or something and the devil wants to kick us on our Shin when we're hurting there we say well you know what I'm going to just protect that I'm not going to let him hit it you know and that's the same kind of thing you know the devil's got one punch at us he looks for every Avenue that he can to bring this bride to a to a place where she'll back off because he knows he buys time if he can get us get us to back off because the Lord said he's not going to lose the one so we're gonna We're Not Gonna back off for very long but but he wants to upset us somehow he'd like to up overturn the Apple card so that we got to take the time to pick up the apples you know it's just the way he is it's in his nature and and it is in his nature to upset this bride but this bride has something more than what she's not walking on her own right see the Lord's watching over her his elect he cares about his elect he knows your name he knows who you are he knows your position he knows what you're going through he knows your weaknesses he knows your strengths he knows where you're how you can you can uh uh uh uh how you can get a hold of God so so he he recognizes that he he doesn't want you he he he he may try Every Which Way but just like the scripture says he can't do anything unless he's allowed he can't do anything unless he's allowed and so he comes he may cry out like he cried out you know what you got a hedge around job you know you got to hedge around him nothing I can't get to him yeah he says well he says I'll give you one shot man but we as Christians well we know we've already had warning guard yourself just like any boxer you know you know the you know your opponent you know his cheap shots and you know your where your weaknesses are guard that weak spot put your hands up keep your guard up no it's too close to the time when when when when when we're coming to the coming of the Lord and it's too close to that time to be stumbling now put your guard up keep your you know we're looking at at our minds you know we recognize that with the day and age we're living in and and all the all the the the the the the the hybrid foods that we look at are well you know the other day we uh we we went and bought some chicken from I don't even know where it was she bought some chicken and it got delivered on a truck my wife and I said well what kind of chickens are those the breasts that she bought were this big I said these aren't chickens these are turkeys I think yeah this is no this chicken is so the census chicken so we've been eating it it tastes like chicken but you know sometimes they say that everything tastes like chicken so I'm not so sure but it sure was big big old chunks and I said well cut them in half and make them look like a real breast you know our little chickens don't give a breast that big but we're thinking you know what is it we're eating hybrid Foods somebody's doing something to the our food line that we're becoming weaker and wiser you say wiser well yeah this computer age is sending us wiser I mean uh any any little trivia question any little question we're we're arguing about well my son says well let's Google it he pulls out his phone and he checks the answer so we're wiser yeah we got all the answers now because we can pull up our iPhone but that doesn't make us that we're that but we are getting weaker right and the minds are getting weaker when you stand out there and you look at the world how they're getting weaker they're they're they're getting to the place where they're getting kind of crazy the other day up in Colorado a guy got up there and thought he was Batman and shot a bunch of people in the theater what reason what what mind do they have they playing a lot of mind I mean uh computer games and things where they want to just shoot anybody walking down the street I don't know what the reason is excuse me my throat I got a cough drop but it's kind of hard to hold it in my mouth okay so that guy killed all those people in Colorado just the other day in Boston they they bombed some people young people that I looked at their pictures young people that really have starting off in Life College college educations I wish I had a college education but College educations thrown away to go to the death to to go to be be killed in a in a in a I guess the death chamber or whatever they do I don't know what they'll give them but notice and one of them died and notice what's in their minds why is their mind so so so uh why are they getting so crazy yeah brother Brown said that one day there the the horrors that that this world can imagine those those those horror movies that you see of zombies and and giant ants and all these things that came out I remember those ones they were scary as ever that all those things that they that they that they spoke about back in those old days he says it'll become a reality where people will actually be seeing uh uh those those those those uh uh plagues that the Bible talks about that'll come out and torment women with long hair and teeth as lions and scorpions Tails those things will come out and they'll be real to the people how can they how can our minds get so so into a virtual world that these things become real I don't understand but the minds are weakening remember the minds are weakening where they're having uh where the where the thin line between reality and hell is being made thinner his main I mean here we we look at it we say well brother Brown talks about it he says this desk is less real than Heaven Is Right Heaven is more real than this desk Heaven is more real than this place Heaven is more real this thing can get foggy and just disappear away in a puff of smoke but you see Heaven is more real see Heaven is reality so what is it we're standing here we're saying angels are more real yeah angels are more real Jesus is more real the Holy Ghost is more real yes those things are more real we tell you we speak about it all these things but you stand here and you say what I can't feel it I can't touch it but yet it produced more right well you go to Hebrews one I mean Hebrews 11th chapter it says the worlds were created of things that don't exist I went through the uh I was I was uh uh looking at uh what was the name of the thing it was called uh I remember it was it was all about about God what was the name of that video brother that you that I had on my iPods I can't remember it but on it it was it was saying that that the worlds the worlds were all created by an explosion okay of matter that wasn't there yeah yeah and then how did they know that they just come into the understanding of that when here in Hebrews the Bible talks about it all along things are made of things that do not appear E equals MC square matter that that the the the the energy and matter they talk about and I I was looking at that I says how could this be how can they make something that how can the science say that they made something out of nothing is because God's the only creator and he can make something out of nothing so you start to see uh you start to see that that as as we start looking at at our place in our position as we look at ourselves as as our Humanity we start to say well look God knows us God had memory of us all the way back from the foundations of the Earth but yet he brought us to this place where where our inlets our seed tastes feel smell in here and yet we we contact our outside world through this uh seed taste field smelling here and inside our soul our memory our conscience our thinking all that the real us is not something that we can see taste feeler smell here the real us is is is is inside of us called our spirit and then even inside of that spirit is a nature and that nature is going to either say I doubt what God has said or I believe what God has said Faith or doubts the only channel that moves that inside nature and out of that if I believe God's word it motivates me it causes me to do things it causes me to want things it causes me to it changes my desires it changes my wants you know they were asking me how do you how do you stay away from the things of the world how do you how do you keep away from those things well my desires changed my want has changed I don't care to do the smoke and I don't care to do the drinking I don't care to do this do the gambling I don't care to do all those things why because there's a desire change that only God's my care is to get to where God is that's where my care is to be in his presence to be in his truth to hear his ministers to hear those that got the word of God for my day and my hour that's where I'm that's where where God's motivating me to and that's what and now when when we stop to talk about the mind how do you get into how do you get into that kind of nature yeah well I was listening to brother Brown talking about that orange tree and uh it inspired me I went over there and I grabbed me a a pocket knife and I got a I got a uh I got a I went to my peach pear tree and I cut off a branch off the pear tree and I looked it up on on a book and I saw that all you have to do is cut a slant slant and then use electrical tape and tape it so I got this pear tree and I walked over to my apple tree which is a red delicious and I cut off one of the red delicious branches and patched that that Pear Tree on there yeah well weeks went on and Springtime came and summertime came in and the crazy thing God blossoms leaves well here's a pear growing off of an apple tree I said well I'm going to have me some red pears so the blossoms got bigger and I knew that little graph wasn't going to hold it so I put a little weight a little stick to support it so it wouldn't break it off and the pear started growing well green pair well I'm waiting I'll wait till it ripens I'll wait till it ripens started ripening ripening it got totally ripe it was still a green pear it was a kefir a kefir a hard pair I said well I expect an apple a red delicious color on it nothing came out it was still the nature of the branch it was still the nature of the branch and exactly like the tree produced over there on the pear tree It produced the same thing out of an apple tree except one thing I noticed uh it didn't last very long because for some reasons pear grow faster than Apples and the patch never did heal it just kept growing growing growing growing until it broke off but it happened I I got that far and I was thinking about nature you know the nature in the branch and I thought well in uh brother Brown preaching and ye must be born again he says well he says you have to he says your nature he says your old uh uh born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies that nature that you were born with that you grew up with that pulls you towards the television that pulls you towards Hollywood that pulls you towards the the comic books and the and the and the video games and the and then it pulls you towards all the the little kitty gambling machines at the store you know where you are put in the corners and all this it pulls you towards all these things pretty soon God comes in and takes a hold of you and you and you and some of us at a later day some kids are kids some of us already when we're pulled into the bad things of all the world's got to offer and some and when we get pulled into all that we still have a cardinal nature we still lie every chance we get and what happens all of a sudden when you bump into what what happened to me is I got a hold of a tape yeah you know I got a hold of a tape and I saw there was something in that tape there's there's something I want there I didn't have it I was in the world I didn't have it but there's something there there's a nature there there's something there I want and I want it more than I want my own life and what happened is little by little okay I started crying out I want the Holy Ghost I want God to move in my life I want it so bad I want God and I'm listening to the tapes I'm hearing what brother Brown's preaching and I says whatever he has I don't have I want that I'm trying to get there and struggling for it and all of a sudden I start noticing hey I don't want those things anymore it's a nature change I don't care for the things of the world anymore amen I don't care for all I care about is the things of God what's happening there's a nature change I want to be I want to be that I want to speak the word amen I want that third pool I want the things that God has promised for my day and age that's coming to me now that's what I want that's what my desire is I want to see the resurrection I want to see my my loved ones come back I want to see the calling up of God that he moves on the people where they're gone for the rapture those are the desires that are coming now and I want to see this Bride come into her position where she says look it's no longer me anymore it's Christ in me amen how can we get there how can we get the mind of Christ how do we get to be born well and you must be born again he says that old nature is killed it's put on the Brown's altar it's sacrificed it goes up in smoke and God's Own nature God's holy ghost comes to dwell in your body it's no longer what happens then like the fruit like that up like that pear tree I like that pear branch has no ability but to produce what its nature is and what is our nature now that we've come into the Holy Ghost come into the presence of God come into it's love joy peace long-suffering gentleness kindness meekness Temperance the the things written in Galatians 5 22. you should start to see that God's own Spirit comes down in you so what are we doing we're starting to catch the mind of Christ now as we read our word now as we read our Bible we start to see that hey it starts to make sense right no longer are we just bumbling through you know at the beginning I heard the seals I read the seals I'll tell you I know that of all those things that brother Brown talked about and where he talked about the marriage and divorce and and the The Mystery of the godhead and all these things but I'm still saying but there's still something else there's still more amen there's the Thunders there's a mystery there's this there's that I stayed wondering and well and and and and still my life was not coming to the place where I could live this gospel without having Christ in my life you're never going to get to a place where you can get with without having the Holy Ghost it's come to a place where uh you know I I'm all my messages anymore get to Christ get to the Holy Ghost get to the anointing of the Holy Ghost because if you don't have that you won't make the resurrection right if you go by way of the grave if you don't have that you you can't understand what God's trying to reveal in your day and age if you don't have the Holy Ghost you don't even have life yet you're not even in his economy so you got to have the Holy Ghost amen you got to have the presence of God in your life you got to have the anointing of his of his of his power and his manifestation then you can come back and say look all the promises in his word well they're my possession I married to these things I got a right to call out Abba Father you know I got a right to say this is my possession Satan you have no right here this is my possession amen how do you get to that place when you get into his mind you start to understand what he's trying to get you to see amen but we look at it all all that the father has given me will come and no man can take them out of his hands amen that's so we realize that when you've come to the place when he knows when he knows you he knows your name he knows what you are he knows what's going on in your life he knows how to fix it he knows how you can take the faith and believe what his word says he knows that if you go by way of the Grave it'll bring you out of the Grave amen because he is the Holy Ghost he is the resurrection in life amen so you start to see just like Levi paid tithes in the loins of Abraham you were in the thoughts of God from the beginning from the foundation of the world you were in Christ when he went to Calvary you were in Christ you've been in Christ all along and all you can do is just manifest what's in you man that's all you can do right right Hallelujah what is it well you start to look and we start to see look there's nothing I can and I can say that uh that would bring you to the to the place where you say I at the you know and the anointed ones at the end time Birdman says you can get anointed right in your spirit you can get anointed in your spirit and you can make do all the you can play out all that the Holy Ghost has yeah you can you could I mean uh you can you can be back here behind the pulpit yeah ministering and not how even be part of the economy of God how can this be because it's per it's it's true that you can get anointed in your spirit but if you don't have the nature down in your soul you got to have the Holy Ghost that's that all comes down to it that is the life amen so whatever what are we looking at we're trying to see how how his mind is and what what were to become as we're as we're coming into the the the the days of the manifestation of the sons of God when we come to the place where we look at Saint John 1 1 and and and we look at what that that that that that Christ has now the scripture says in first John 1 1 it says and the Word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us okay that same word that you were in a Calvary it's now come to the place where it has to manifest itself for what the prophecies that were mentioned through the age through this age have to become alive in you it has to come to a place where you say look I have to manifest something here it's my part to play here I got to produce what brother Brown was talking about how am I going to produce it I don't got it I don't got it I'm searching my pocket I don't got it you know what it's just like that black man that brother Brown says uh that that this little story where he says you're going to jump through that wall and he says well he says uh if God's word tells me to jump through that wall I'm going to start heading to that wall he says you can't go through that wall there's no hole there he says if God's words telling me to head to that wall and jump through that wall he'll make a Hole by the time I arrive there and that's what's happening we're coming to a rapture we might think we don't possess what it takes to make the Rapture but if you've got the Holy Ghost you've got all it takes because he's going to bring you to a place where it'll manifest itself in your life at the time that it's necessary you say necessary a third pool when Pentecost years ago Pentecost talks about times when somebody shoots bullets through a wall and they fall off of the sisters dresses yeah says they never penetrate they penetrate the wall okay they go through big big big guns go through a wall okay but they just can't get through the sister's dress why because there's an anointing there is an anointing there and that anointing is the Holy Ghost and when the anointing of the Holy Ghost is here it's here to take you to a certain place brother Brown said this Bride of the last age of this day is it isn't going to go down like the first bride did right the first bride gave her life through the Lion's Denson all those Roman gladiators took their swords out sliced their heads off if the Roman gladiators with their techno equipment come in here now and open up set their Clips in and start firing I doubt very much that one bullet will pierce one Christian why because we're at a time of a third pool we're at a time when you know when you when you look at it it says you know David David talks about times where where where they fall to his right they fall to his life but no nothing's hitting him my brother was talking about his time in Vietnam and he says Daniel I don't understand it he was telling me he said we're walking through the bush he says the guy on the front of me Falls over the guy on back of me Falls over I look at the jungle right around me and it's bullets are hidden right in the in the leaves right around me I don't know what happened I was stoned out of my mind but not one of them would hit me not one of those bullets would hit me and I says you know my you know you know that your mother's prayers were going out for you all the time you were in the bush I says we stood there and we prayed and prayed Catholics praying at a at an altar and and uh what do they call that a clay saint praying at an altar and a clay saying but we were praying for you and those prayers met the feet of God and he he saved you right he says he saved you possibly so you can come to the Lord today you know I kept telling him the Lord's dealing with you so what happens We Believe that just like God can take take and keep keep someone in all this atrocity we know that he can keep the bride of Christ because it's her brother his bride you know when you realize the price that was paid for you when you realize he went to Calvary for you when you realize the suffering he did he did it so that this bride can be part of him the price he paid for you he ain't going to let you fall he's not going to take you this far to let you fall right so we know want to know them and as we start to look at the mind of Christ and we start to look at the examples that God gave us through his word and we start to see the very uh uh way that he has kept it he has kept it from from from being uh uh uh what you call it uh adulterer sized or or changed or or moved around he's kept his word throughout all the ages well he's here to keep his bride too amen he wants his bride to be ready and the things that now you start to look at the things that that this bride's bringing to look through the ages you look you know when we look at at out there we say Okay baptism let's say a Catholic guy gets up there and says well you know what uh I'm going to go to my priest and ask him why is it we don't submerge we don't we don't go under the water you sprinkle us and the priest says well that's the way the church does it yeah and he's got a decision to make am I going to do it according to the word because John was baptizing where there was much water and submerging the people or am I going to get sprinkled yeah yeah he says well maybe he'd say I'm going to take the word I'm leaving the Catholic Church and he goes over to a good Baptist Church in the Baptist Church says well we sprinkled to we don't sprinkle we baptize we put you right under the water then he finds out here in the word it says in Acts 2 38. it's are you doing it in the name of of the Lord Jesus Christ and they said well no we use Matthew 28 19 father son Holy Ghost he says well my absolute is to believe the Baptist Church no the word of God so now you're going to have to baptize me or I got to find somebody that'll baptize me in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's submersion okay wait a minute along with Acts 19 I mean Acts 2 38 it says and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost well if I got baptized and I got caught they called the name of the Lord Jesus Christ on me why don't I got the Holy Ghost I have a right to that that's part of the promise in my word in the word of God so now we go to prayer and we start saying Lord give me the Holy Ghost give me the anointing of your spirit give me the power of God give me all that you are bring it down deliver me that's the nature of God coming down and living in you to where no longer is it your words anymore but it's him that wants to do his work in you amen so are we we're looking at the trueness we're looking at look we're we're coming to a place now we start coming down to okay we got through all the denominations and got back to the word of God now we want to hear the more excellent way we want to hear the more truthful way so when we come to the message we talk about clothesline all your sisters aren't supposed to cut your hair and oh you brothers are your sisters aren't supposed to put on a pair of pants oh your sister oh we'll pick other sisters a lot but us Brothers want to stay with a denomination and go ahead and keep keep doing our our smoking and drinking and stuff like that or and then now it comes down are you really taking hold your Bible reading your Bible every day praying every day seeking God every day you know I saw a good example of this but my son-in-law Joseph my gosh he has scriptures written all over his walls and he's not just leaving them there for pretty he goes and looks at them and reads them every day well that's pretty good I like that I like I know my grandkids are growing up good amen so I started looking at that I said wow that's pretty cool now when I start to look at it I look at I look at reading your Bible praying every day fasting seeking the Lord seeking for Revelation seeking for asking God in desperation you know I got in desperation when when when when when the Jews took over Jerusalem that's a few years ago the Jews took over Jerusalem and I started praying and crying and asking God what is it Are we almost in time for the rapture what's going on I kept starting getting deeper into the messages looking for what's gonna happen our time clock the Jews have moved a big step they took over Jerusalem I even bought the book oh Jerusalem listen to the whole thing seeing how their plight their fight for Jerusalem went right they took Jerusalem back they haven't taken the Temple Mount yet but they're at the Olympic minting wall looking straight across every day they're crying out for their Messiah little do they know that there's people that have the Holy Ghost their Messiahs walking right behind them you know you start to look at you look at you look at what's going on you look at you look at the timepiece Israel and you look at what's going on out there and you start to realize that God's word won't fall to the ground he's made he's kept it through the years he's watched it he makes sure that it's going to come to pass now you start to look at hey what does that have to do with me what does that have to do with me here in Georgia here in here in Lula well how do I fall into place there well where's my part in this you start to look at the scripture you start to look at the promises you say well look here the Bible says that the bride has made herself ready well how am I making myself ready am I reading my Bible and praying every day have I put to put away the televisions am I am I gotten away from those computer video clips am I I mean we're seeing the same thing Hollywood offered a long time ago on your computer video clips have I have I gotten to to a walk with God where where no longer is this flesh pulling on me but no but now I've come to the place where I'm I'm walking in Christ where I'm walking in faith where I'm praying for my brethren where instead of gossiping about my brethren I'm praying for my brethren have I come to the place where I'm I'm looking towards Higher Grounds seeking to be seeking the Holy Ghost saying to the Holy Ghost Lord move me over more I want to know more about what you got to show me in this day and age I'm going to go through the messages once again I'll go through the seals again I'll go through the I'll go through the word of God I'll go through the church ages again I'll go through the word of God again see the the the Holy Ghost he you know he's got he's building a nature in you and this Nature's to bring you to a faith the Fate that was once given to the Saints amen where you walk up and say silver and gold I don't have but such as I have I'll give to you in the name of Jesus Christ rise to your feet how can you say that you can only say it if you have it amen you can't say anything you don't God amen and when we look at the trueness of it throughout all ages when we're talking about astronomy they used to say science used to say that the Earth was center of the universe I opened up a National Geographic map of the universe and they said they don't have it all in this map and I saw that the Earth is one little small Speck in the corner of the Milky Way galaxy somewhere why does God look so much on us why does he care so much of this little speck amen because this little specks in his heart they're in the hands of God amen that little speck is predestinated called elected Amen to manifest thus saith the Lord for her day at her hour how can you say thou saith the Lord for my day and my hour the only way you can say it is if you're you've been in the word of God you've been in there you've seek your your feeding off the fountain amen you're feeding off the fountain that's never running dry you're really he's revealing himself to you amen so we know that as as in the aspects of of God's word we look at the at time time is running to running out you say well uh uh I wonder why why the economy is going the way it's going well the economy the economy it's not as it seems right there's things that go on behind the scenes there's big money shuffling around Nations being sold off in Africa you know that a lot of those wars were caused by Big Money moving around someplace else not even in Africa right because somebody out there wants uh wants the power oh yeah right does it even want the land just wants to say I'm in power and big money moves around and there goes nations of people what is it we start to look at it these aren't as they seem but we know they're all in God's hands he only allows Satan to do what he allows him to do and it will bring prophecy to pass it'll our everything will bring prophecy to pass sometimes you might say well I don't think that cars ever going to materialize we'll never have a car that drives itself out there in the highways where somebody's playing checkers while it's driving down the road never don't don't throw it too far it could happen in a second hey maybe putting it on General Motors may have it on the design table right now hey Matt you never you just don't know Toyota might have it out there you don't know but we do know this that God's words more true than anything that you can see in the news in the world in the things to come God's words more true he's kept it Through the Ages you know if you look at it through Noah through through Moses through Noah through through through our lord Jesus throughout all times he's kept it only because he wants to be sure that you have it in his purity you personally have it in his Purity to bring you to a faith to the faith that will bring you to a rapturing faith glory amen God bless you let's uh let's turn to our feet as we go before the Lord in prayer you excuse my voice it's getting kind of funny sounding but I know that as we look at at the day we're living in we're looking at a time you know when we start looking at the sages of all the Paul and and Daniel and Isaiah and of course when we start looking at at their their their plight and then we look at brother branham's plight what a much more excellent opportunity we've had we don't have to read brother Brandon we can hear Brother banham personally testifying and telling you the experience you have to read Paul's you have to read them all right but as in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to serve the voices on recording that's a prophecy telling you it will be on recording at the end time and it's yours you have the
