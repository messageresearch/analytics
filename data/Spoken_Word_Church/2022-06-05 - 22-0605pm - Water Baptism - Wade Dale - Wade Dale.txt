know that's a month and a half away but i'll let you know i haven't really i've been trying to uh we may play a tape or you know we may not even have service but i sure hate to not have service especially for the ones that are staying here so we may just play a tape or something because all the ministers and and deacons and all will all be gone pretty much so i want to read you this uh my quote of the day from the testimony of a true witness brother brown said god's witness the holy ghost the holy ghost itself living in us would never affiliate in an organization you can't organize god he's god what will it do go back the same way it was in the first place that's what we're going to be speaking on today water baptism it'll go back to the beginning back to the original black back to where it started from it'll baptize the same way they did what early church first church it'll teach the holy ghost the same way that it did they'll teach the people the same way that it did it'll abstain from organizations like they did it will have a room for all like you did who will come they'll be clean and holy like they did they'll be filled with a spirit like they were they'll be fearless like they were the same thing that happened to them will happen to those in the last days in the evening lights like it was before god send that voice god sent us that voice amen the voice in the end time so let's bow our heads dear lord thank you for this day that you give us again lord a time that we can settle down just for a few minutes lord and hear from you father we pray that what we say will be pleasing to you father is going to come straight from your word but let it may be in may it enter into our hearts lord because without revelation it's just like reading sure enough a newspaper but we're not here to read newspaper we're here to hear from you lord we're here to hear from the will that you wrote us lord when you died at calvary you gave us a will you gave us a testimony a testament written in your own blood lord and now we're just given the testament we're giving the will out to the people that are baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and receive the baptism of the holy ghost father we pray that you'd be with us in the furthermore service be the ones that are being baptized lord just give us this day our daily bread we we we come for that to receive our daily blessing from you lord we pray lord that you just be with the ones that are not with us ones that are traveling and the ones that are sick father be with the ones lord that uh trudy and island sister chloe lord being overseas father we pray that you should be with them and touch them bring them back safe lord we ask these things in jesus name amen and lord we need some rain we need some rain my poor little garden needs some rain all right so let's go to matthew now we're going to talk on water baptism since we've since we've had water baptism for the past uh today if only three get baptized that will be 19 that will be baptized so that's a pretty good group of people to be baptized some were re-baptized and some had never been baptized before but like i said sometimes some people just get baptized because their neighbor gets baptized or their brother gets baptized so their sister gets baptized and but we're going to talk about today correct baptism and we're going to show it in the bible listen we don't need quotes to prove these things god did send us a prophet just like he sent peter james john paul people have problems with prophets i don't have a problem there's been prophets god sent prophets since the dawn of time there's been prophets moses isaiah jeremiah you know why people are afraid of william branham because he was different he preached the true word of god like it was in the first church age he didn't compromise with anything amen and i appreciate what he did but like i said before this is not william brown's message it's my message it's god's message to me and you it's a he was a spokesman a conduit just like um brother paul was playing the trumpet that trumpet just sits there it's totally mute without somebody picking it up and blowing into it and knowing how to play that trumpet so what we're going to do today i pray that god will help me just blow through this trumpet and show you some few things maybe that you've never seen on water baptism but maybe some things that you had just a refresher of course so just pray for us let's go to matthew 28 verse 16. so then the 11 disciples went away into galilee i'll do the birthdays in a minute and then or after service is over i'll read the birthdays for june into a mountain where jesus had appointed them now look this is right at the ascension everybody with me this is the ascension at the ascension he's getting ready to go up the day of pentecost is getting ready to be fulfilled 11 days later everybody with me all right this is jesus now look listen all the disciples are standing there except judas he's already hung himself so all the disciples are there all 11 of them everybody with me all right so they're listening to what you're listening to right now and matthew is writing it in his commentary he's writing his part of the gospel that jesus said because jesus didn't say this in every one of the gospels he said it in this one we're going to show that in just a minute then the 11 disciples went away into galilee into a mountain where jesus had appointed them and when they saw him they worshipped him but some doubt it wow man just rose from the dead showed himself did mighty miracles and he's standing there alive again and some doubted you son listen some people would argue with a stop sign amen but some doubted and jesus came and spake unto them what those that are going to listen yeah i wasn't going to say who it was but all power is given unto me in heaven and earth so there was no other power anywhere else because he was almighty god go ye therefore and teach all nations all right baptizing them not sprinkling not just barely getting them under no baptized we'll see what that is in just a minute go you therefore and teach all nations baptizing him in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost not in the name of the father name of the son the name of the holy ghost because they're not names he says in the name singular one name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost teaching them now look he's telling the disciples take what i've got take what i'm telling you i'm god almighty and human flesh you know that all power has been given unto me and i'm fixing to leave but i'm going to come back on a dependent day of pentecost and i want you to listen to what i'm saying and i want you to do exactly what i tell you because that's going to be the first church go you therefore and teach all nations baptizing in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost teaching them to observe what all things whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i am with you always even unto the end of the world amen acts 2 verse 37. now this is 11 days later on the day of pentecost everybody with me it's not where we got like amnesia it's like 10 years later five years later two years later it was 11 days from when jesus said what he said in matthew to this right here in acts 2. now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart what peter peter peter steps out and says men and brethren he preaches them about a 30-minute most powerful sermon ever been preached because 3 000 people get converted praise god now when they heard this they who the three thousand now remember it was not three thousand jews they were gathering on the day of pentecost because it was a festival so there was people from all nations that were that were gathered there not just the jews all right they're by with me then peter said oh wait a minute now when they heard this they were pricked in their hearts something something's different we've never heard this kind of preaching before he said unto peter and the rest of the apostles so now look the all the apostles are there did i not just tell you the bible said the 11 were there well there's 11 plus there's a hundred and something 120 in the upper room they got the holy ghost and here they come out on the porch and they're preaching then peter said unto them repent repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost what a promise for that promise isn't to you and to your children and them that are far off thank god the united states of america even as many as the lord our god shall call and with many other words he did testify in his word saying save yourself from this untoward generation then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day they were added unto them about 3 000 souls it took them 11 disciples a long time to baptize 3 000 people but the bible said they were baptized in christian bapti baptism according to acts 238 everybody with me because look what it says it says then they continued steadfast in the what apostles doctrine and fellowship it wasn't they got baptized and then heard matthew said no no i didn't hear matthew was there now mark wasn't luke wasn't but matthew and john were there and when paul peter stood up and said repent everybody be baptized the name of jesus christ matthew said praise god because there's only one baptism but we're going to get into that in just a minute so they continue steadfast in the apostles doctrine and fellowship and in breaking of bread and in prayer you may be seated in the lord in his blessing to the reading of the word now the greek lexicon right here we see in strong concordance this is baptism and baptized all right because there's two different things in the way we're going to look at it because you can be baptized with the holy ghost are baptized in waters everybody with me all right stay awake today i want y'all to stay awake that's why i had to stand up long time we're going to stand up some more all right this word call is baptizo now i want you to love this is going to be a little bit funny maybe to some people but i want you to watch this it means to wash or baptize in other words immerse because we want it to symbolize a death death burial resurrection all right that's what we're going to read in romans before we go outside to dip repeatedly or to immerse to submerge to cleanse by dipping or submerging to wash make clean with water to wash oneself or debate all right now watch this to overwhelm now what's this not to be confused with 9 11 with bapto because it's baptized in baptism these are the two words he's talking about right here the clearest example that showed the meaning of baptizo is in text from the greek poet and physician niconder who lived about 200 bc so he lived 200 years before christ that's what bc means before christ it is a recipe for making pickles i'm just reading what it says it's a recipe for making pickles and it's helpful because it uses both words nyquinder said that what in order to make a pickle the vegetable should be first dipped listen to what i'm saying a pickle is what it's a cucumber and it's going to go through a change or a baptism and it's going to change into a pickle a cucumber is going to change into a pickle but remember once that change happens you can't go back can't go back to the cucumber listen nycander says in order to make a pickle the vegetable should first be dipped bapto which would be baptizing into boiling water and then baptized in the vinegar solution the baptism of the holy ghost both verbs concern the immersion of vegetables in a solution but the first is temporary your water baptism doesn't save you it just wets the pickle i mean where's the cucumber sorry it wet's the cucumber but now what happens when you boil it and put it in this vinegar solution the second the act of baptizing the vegetable produces a permanent change when used in the new testament this word often refers to our union identification with christ than to our water baptism so but he is believed and baptized shall be saved christ is saying that mere intellectual ascent is not enough there must be a union with him and a real change like the vegetable to the pickle pickle me lord i don't know how you doing that in spanish luis but pickled a pickle so that's the word baptism look right here ephesians 4 verse 5 says what one lord one faith one baptism now i just read you two different ones seemingly different ones right i read you matthew 28 19 and i read you acts 2 38. you can't do away with the word of god okay change the word of god okay make it fit your idea there's one lord one faith and one baptism all right so how we're going to get this thing started matthew 3 verse 4 says in the same john now this is john the baptist why in the world was he called john the baptist because he baptized people and the same john had raymond of campbell's hair and leather girdle boy and his meat was locust and wild honey he ate healthy i don't know about the locust then then it went out to him jerusalem and all judea and all the reasons about jordan and what and we're baptized of him in jordan confessing their sins john gets a revelation that they need to be baptized confessing their sins but not calling on a name because he didn't know who that was yet everybody with me all right so let's go to matthew 3 verse 13. now look jesus if we have to start our christian journey with water baptism then jesus he figured he better do hit start his earthly journey in water baptism amen then come jesus from galilee to jordan unto john to be baptized to him but john forbade him saying i have need to be baptized of thee and cometh out of me and jesus answered and said unto him suffer it to be so in other words you're right but thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness then he suffered him what was he doing john was washing the sacrifice the sacrifice in the old testament the paschal lamb the passover lamb had to be washed before it could be sacrificed so jesus came to be washed as the ultimate sacrifice he kept the ultimate lamb of god he came to be washed before his sacrifice and jesus when he was baptized went up straight way out of the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and saw a spirit of the spirit of god descending like a dove and lighting upon him a little voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son and who i am well pleased in other words jesus must have done something that pleased the father amen isn't that what we're here for all right so now look for jesus to start his earthly journey his teaching was john's teaching was baptized jesus teaching was what the kingdom of heaven in hand you must be born again everybody with me but now what did he say in john 5 43 he said i didn't he said i came in my father's name everybody with me i came in my father's name john 5 43 and we know that the church started in the book of acts everybody with me the church the real church started in the book of acts in 1830 at the holy ghost fell on the day of pentecost started this new church started the bride started what jesus told them to go and get new converse baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost and then 11 days later they baptize them in the name of jesus christ somebody's either confused or we're confused one of the two all right and and the man that wrote it matthew was standing there when all that was going on he should have said no wait a minute jesus told us something something else because you know you listen in the denominational world they'll tell you they said well we'll take jesus baptize baptism over peter's we'll explain it in just a second because there can't be a contrary in the the bible cannot be contrary to each other amen so the church started in the book of acts everybody with me on this the beginning of the bride body the most important thing the foundation the first church age god had to start his church right he could not start his church wrong he had to start his church right and he did amen so he gave the institution to the 11 disciples of what to do in the book of matthew and we'll read that again in just a minute but he said go into all the world preach the gospel get new converts baptize them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost and then we're going to see some other places where it talks about raising the dead healing the sick casting out devils but now look there was three and a half year spot that jesus preached remember from the day he was on on jordan's river he started his preaching that the kingdom of heaven is here and you must be born again and then he expounds for three and a half years is everybody with me all right he expounds for three and a half years now look then there's four gospels that comes out of that three and a half years everybody with me amen three god four gospels matthew mark luke and john they cannot be contrary to each other they are complementary to each other everybody with me say amen all right there's four not different ways of looking at it it's four ways of looking at it amen everybody with me now what god instituted though is that what i'm going to have a book of acts i'm going to come back on the day of pentecost and i'm going to enter into my people and i'm going to start my church and i'm going to start it right and i'm going to use these four gospels these four men matthew martin luke and john to put a guard around that book of acts because what does the book of acts mean it means the way that the apostles acted that's why it's called acts so it's the acts of the apostles actually it's the word put in action because remember in matthew mark luke and john not one person got saved while jesus was here except the thief on the cross and he got eternal life imparted to him when he got over into paradise not here on the earth so jesus was what talking about a future event that was going to be written down or pinned or whatever you want to say by four different individual people everybody with me on this don't be quiet matthew mark luke and john four gospels we read them all right remember there's a fifth gospel right mama that's what the prophet said and i believe it but there's four gospels matthew mark luke and john and they guarded the book of acts whatever they said in those four gospels had to coincide with the book of acts because the book of acts the church wasn't started in matthew mark luke and john anybody with me the church was not started in matthew martin luke and john it was started in acts acts 2 38 i just read it to you the holy ghost fell on 120 people changed their life entirely and they were so scared beforehand that they locked herself up now they got fulfilled with the holy ghost that burst the doors open went outside and the men said they must be drunk they were staggering around they were praising god they didn't care who saw them matthew and john were there all right they missed something up there mine's up there we go so now you've got the four gospels matthew mark luke and john and we know that according to the bible that there's four beasts we're going to read it here in revelations there's four beasts that guard the altar or that guard remember remember back in the old testament when you had the ark of the covenant which was what the word of god everybody with me that was the word of god they were protected by a lion ox man an eagle banner you had three tribes three tribes three tribes and three tribes that made 12. even in banks county we can add well that's multiplication but they were guarding the mercy seat they were guarding that that thing that they cherished the most so in the new testament as the new testament begins god the book of acts is the acts of the apostles it's when it's when his children were born it's when he was going to start his church the right way so he had a guard matthew mark luke and john lyon oxman and eagle if you don't believe me look in your scofield bible if you've got a bible look in the flower and when you come to every matthew it says the boldness of a line says the labor of an ox from math for mark it says to the intelligence because what was luke luke was a physician he was smart intelligent so there's the man and then the eagle anointing was john there was a lot of prophetic things that john said that nobody else put in the gospel but those four together though they dovetailed just like this they don't come apart but then what they do is to they guard whatever that is in acts that's what they guard am i okay with that let's read revelations four verse one it says after this what after the church ages this is john after all the church ages he's being caught up and after this i looked and behold the door was opened in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as it were a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will show thee things which must be hereafter. and i and immediately i was in the spirit and behold the throne was set in heaven and one not three one set on the throne and he that sat on was to look upon like jasper and sardine stone there was a rainbow around the throne and in sight like emerald and round about the throne were four and twenty seats which is what the 12 apostles and the 12 patriarchs is everybody with me on that 24 elders all right and upon the seats i saw four and 20 elders sitting clothed in white raiment they had on their head crowns of gold and out of the throne preceded lightning and thundering in voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of god now we know that was not god doesn't have seven spirits he's one spirit but he has seven dispensations that he works in all right everybody with me on that and before the throne there was a sea of glass like in the crystal so here's a sea of glass and in the midst of the throne and round about the throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind and the first beast was like a lion the second beast was like a calf or an ox the third beast had the face of a man he said brother wait what's this guy do water baptism if i wasn't reading you this it wouldn't have anything to do with it it'll go in there somehow the third beast had the face of a man and the fourth was like a flying eagle and the four beasts had each of them six wings about them and they were full of eyes within and they rest not day and night saying holy holy holy lord god almighty which was and is and is to come now these four beasts the lion ox man and eagle we know as believers that that was the holy ghost it was shown to us in ezekiel there was a wheel the middle of the wheel part of the wheel it was right there with the children of israel but it it's the baptism of the holy ghost it's the holy ghost in your life the believers but now remember these are not beasts there's two different kinds of beasts in the bible is that correct one is a therion beast which is an untamable irreverent beast and that's the beast over in revelations but these beasts right here are called zunes i'm reading it right here out of the greek lexicon they're zooms they're living beings so in other words it's not just a an allegory it's something living and those four beasts as the bible says make up one they have eyes before and behind revelation they see ever they see in the past they see in the future they see on either side it's the holy ghost helping me and you see what's going on everybody with me on that all right so it's matthew martin luke and john they guard those four beasts the lion ox man and the eagle would be matthew martin luke and john i tell you again read in your scofield bible look in the very front of it it'll say the book of matthew it'll say lion book of mark ox and you can look at their commentaries and you can see that matthew was really bold go forth into all the world preach the gospel baptize in the name of the father and of the son of the holy ghost mark didn't even say that mark was laboring the whole time he was in the in the in his commentary or in his chapter and then luke was very intelligent there was a lot of things that he knew because remember luke wasn't there when all this happened god had to show it to him and he had to write it down all right and then john was the prophetic and there's a lot of john you know do you know that about 75 of john was written in the upper room john 14 15 16 17 18 all those about five or six chapters jesus spoke to him and then it said they went to the garden so he's the only one that wrote that whole sermon that jesus preached about us being one and and about them protecting you and i mean about god protecting you and all that was written in the upper room nobody else wrote about it but john but yet matthew was uh he was there with him all right everybody with me on this we're getting to we're going to make a point here to where we'll nail this thing down all right so now you've got the book of acts all right the book of acts which is the acts of the apostles it's the acts of the holy ghost and the apostles and they acted right right everybody with me they acted right they didn't start this thing wrong they started it right on the day of pentecost god wanted his church started right and he wants his church as i read that quote he wants the church in the end time to be right he requires that it's right anybody with me so now look matthew what do you say about this well this is how i'm going to guard the book of acts then the 11 disciples went away into galilee into a mountain where jesus had appointed them and when they saw him they worshiped him but some doubted and jesus came and spoke unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and earth go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you now listen he's given them a commandment jesus himself god almighty human flesh is giving them a commandment and 11 days later they turn around and don't do it think about it matthew how are you going to guard the book of acts well this is what jesus said this is the lion this is the line of the tribe of judah this is exactly what jesus said on that day right before the ascension teach them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i am with you always even unto the end of the world amen now let's see what mark has to say about it this is the ox mark 16 verse 14 says and afterwards he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at me this is the same exact scenario that we're in matthew everybody with me as they said it meet and um upgraded them with their unbelief and hardness of heart now this is the same thing that happened over there in matthew m but mark is writing his version of it or his part of it it's kind of like a preacher said one time and i agree with it that that matthew had a strand of the rope mark had a strand of the rope luke had a strand of the rope and john had a strand of the robe and jesus was a rope they just twirled it together to make one because they couldn't be different had to be the same afterwards he appeared unto the leaven as it said it meet and um upgraded them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because remember back up there in matthew it says that many what some doubted right there some doubted this is the same thing marx mark what are you writing how are you going to protect it mark afterwards he appeared in the eleven as they said it meet and upbraided them for their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them which had seen him before after he was risen and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned now matthew you told your part here i'm going to sell my part by the holy ghost because remember the line ox man and eagle is the holy ghost not two holy ghosts not two different opinions one opinion and it's god's and i believe it he that believeth and baptized it shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs here we go now my mark how are you gonna how you gonna protect that book of acts well i'm going to tell them what they're going to do matthew told them what jesus said mark's going to tell them what's going to happen after they get the holy ghost and these signs shall follow them that believe it in my name not in my title in my name they shall cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them and they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the lord has spoken unto them he was received up into heaven same scenario we're going to look over here in john same one in luke same one in mark is the same one in matthew they all four had four different versions four different strands of the same rope but it was still the rope because he said in my name my name so then after the lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and set on the right hand of god now look and they went forth and preached everywhere the lord working with them confirming the word with signs following how you gonna protect it mark i'm gonna tell them what's gonna happen when they get the holy ghost after they're baptized in correct baptism in the name of the father and of the son of the holy ghost which is the lord jesus christ now here's the man anointing here's luke 24. now watch this i really had never read it like this before until the lord had me go back and read it but every one of these has something to do with a name matthew said in the name of the father and of the son of the holy ghost mark said in my name they shall cast out devils now watch luke here's the man anointing the smart guy how are you going to protect it luke and said unto them thus it is written and thus it behoove christ the suffering derives from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sins what acts 2 38 say repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins what does a man say luke and that repentance and remission of sin should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at jerusalem isn't that the same thing jesus said and you're a witness of these things and behold i send the promise what's the promise acts 2 38 baptize the name of the lord in the name of jesus christ for remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promises unto you and behold i send the promise of my father upon you but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high so they're going to the upper room to be endued with power and a false baptism no that ain't happening luke how you guarding it i'm going to say it just like matthew did but just in a little bit different way and he led them out as far as bethany lifted up his hands and blessed them and it came to pass while he blessed them he was parted from them and carried up into heaven all right let's see john what you got to say about this here's john here's the eagle anointing here's the prophetic anointing of god john verse 21 verse 21 verse 15 through 17. so when they had died jesus said to who simon peter simon son of joseph jonas loveth thou me more than these now who is this he talking to peter he says unto him yea lord thou knowest that i love thee and he said unto him feed my lambs feed my lambs jesus talking it's in red letter if you don't mind that's red letter i didn't put that there that was there from the bible feeding my lambs he said to him again the second time simon son of jonah loveth jonas loveth thou mean he said to him yea lord and thou knowest that i love thee he said unto him feed my sheep he fed his lambs on the day of pentecost but he fed his sheep later on in his life there's a difference in the lamb and the sheep a lamb is a little bitty thing sheep has been what grown up a little bit everybody with me feed my sheep in other words peter i am going to give you the responsibility to feed my people and not feed them faults feed them true he said to him again the second time and he said feed my sheep he said unto him a third time simon son of jonas loveth thou me peter was grieved but peter didn't have a lot of brother economy he didn't have a lot of patience and temperance because he wasn't born again yet but when he got born again he probably knew he should not have said this but peter was grieved because he said unto him third time the love is now me and he said to me lord thou knowest all things they'll know us that i love thee and jesus said unto him one more time feed my sheep peter was the spokesman on the day of pentecost jesus we're going to see you here in just a minute peter got something that jesus didn't have maybe you'll stay awake for a minute jesus answered them i told you and you believe not john 10 verse 25 the works that i do in my father's name now remember father's not a name what was the name of the father jesus christ brother's a title jehovah's a title rose of sharon is a title we'll read what a title is it's a word put before or after a name to signify a position it has nothing to do with person but you believe not because you are not my sheep as i said unto you my sheep peter my sheep is going to hear my voice through you that's how peter's going to feed him he's going to speak the voice of god through peter the voice of god is going to feed through peter and feed his sheep my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow that me and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand praise god matthew 16 verse 13 says when jesus came to the coast of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that i the son of man am and they said some say you're john the baptist some say you're elijah some say you're jeremiah or one of the prophets he said but who do you say that i am and simon peter the one that's going to feed his sheep the one that's going to stand up on the day of pentecost and proclaim this new beginning of how to do this in your christian journey this is how you're going to do it because jesus said feed my sheep peter was given the commission to feed that first church age jesus said unto him blessed art thou simon bar jonah for flesh and blood had blood had not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it and i will give unto you a set of keys jesus didn't even have jesus gave them to him and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth i'll bind it in heaven whatsoever i shall loose on earth you loose on earth i'll loose it in heaven he gave that to peter and i give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven he didn't give them to john he didn't give him to he didn't give them to paul hello he gave them to peter so peter's got the keys of the kingdom whatever he's going to unlock god's going to unlock it in heaven whatever he's going to close down here god's going to close it in heaven everybody with me matthew 11 verse 25 says at that time jesus answered and said i thank thee o father lord of heaven and earth because hit you have hid these things from the wise and prudent and reveal them unto babes by four different gospels four different men's vision of the same rope but they have their strand but when you weave them all together it's got to be revealed to babes by the holy ghost because thou has hid these things from the wives in prudence i'm saying this morning god never wanted the bible to be read like a newspaper it's a love letter it has it has no power read as a newspaper sure it gives you wonderful history it gives you stories it gives you people and it gives you all these different things but without the inspiration that it was written with it's just like reading the newspaper and how many know that the newspaper is a real reliable source of information just like the internet even so father for it seemed good in thy sight all things are delivered unto me of my father and no man knoweth the son but the father neither knoweth any man the father saved the son and he to whomsoever the son will reveal him in other words if you're not revealed if you're not revealed in that correct way right there you'll have a trinitarian doctrine you'll have three persons in the godhead and ain't no such thing a person is a personality personality is an individual they're not three equal gods you can't have three equal gods which one was born first who created one first they just all appear at one time no there's only one god with many manifestations so now we're fixing to open a door matthew you're on this side mark you're on this side luke you're on this side john you're on this side and inside of you is a book of acts inside of you is a way to get the holy ghost so we're getting ready to open the door and somebody's got the key amen we know who's got the key peter's got the key peter now what do you got to say when you open that door now when they heard this they were picked in their heart and said unto peter and the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do amen click repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sin and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost he unlocked it down here and god was god wasn't up in heaven going on peter that's not what i said when i was on earth i didn't say that he said there's my son doing exactly what i saw he would do from eternity i gave him the keys i wanted him to have the keys because he was the one that was going to start that church right the most vile of all of them most of us peter cursed through stuff cut cut somebody's ear off went fishing when jesus wanted to talk to him but peter once you get the holy ghost you're going to be different then peter said then repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promises unto you and to your children and them that are far off as many as the lord our god shall call and with many other words he testified in his word is saying save yourself from this untoward generation then they that gladly received his word gladly received that baptism matthew was standing there all the other disciples were standing there and they didn't say peter that's not what jesus said if you ever thought about that they were standing there in all four gospels the 11 disciples were standing there with jesus when he said what he said now they're everyone standing with peter and there's no distension there's no controversy they gladly received this word and they were baptized that's what i was shouting about out in the in the garden i thought man look at that they gladly received it the open the door peter you got the key what are you going to say about it matthew how are we going to get to acts 2 38 he said through matthew 28 19. luke how you gonna get tax 238 we gonna go and tell to baptizing my name john we're going to tell a story about peter feeding sheep because that's what's going to happen on the day of pentecost that's how we're going to get listen the only way to truly baptize is to baptize in the name of the father and of the son of the holy ghost in the name of the lord jesus christ and the same day were added about 3 000 souls so they got baptized the right way there was 3 000 people added to the kingdom and they continued steadfast in the apostles doctrine they went to church the apostles church and they continued steadfast in the apostles doctrine and fellowship and breaking bread and in prayer amen i want to ask you something while we're stopped right here just for a second i know we've all heard this but when we went to the philippines and brother ernie villanueva and some of them started the mystery expo what did they put on their banner ten thousand dollars to the first person that will show anybody being baptized in the bible in those titles of father son holy ghost oh man them brothers and denominational brothers they were heading through the bible you can't find it i'll give you 10 million dollars if you can find one person ever been baptized in a title the father-son holy ghost is the bible that confused is the bible that wrong no it's just hidden from the wise and prudent do you remember when somebody said something about water baptism to you and you could you're like my mama was baptizing father son holy ghost i i got aunts and uncles that were baptized named fathers and hogan what are you talking about but when you saw it what happened when you really see water baptism you'll see it and there's no other way you can be baptized i'll prove to you in just a minute that was a catholic doctrine started by the catholic church had a friend of mine one time mark he got converted and he was real zealous and he was a baptist and he was talking about the roman catholic church being the old mother horn about them praying to saints and and about you know this that and the other and i looked at him i said mark that's wonderful i said but you baptized exactly the way they tell you to baptize no we don't know it let's go to the let's go let's go read something right here nowhere in history until the roman catholic church was anybody ever baptized in the name of the father and the son and the holy ghost they were all baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ or jesus christ of the lord until the catholic church changed it and nowhere in the bible has anybody ever been baptized in those titles acts 4 verse 8 says then peter filled with the holy ghost so he's not just some guy that walking around on the street that they picked up off the street and said here say this then peter being filled with the holy ghost sending them you rulers of the people and elders of israel if we this day be examined of the good deeds done to the impotent man he's talking about healing the man at the gate beautiful by what means is he made whole be it known unto you all and to all the people of israel that by the name of jesus christ of nazareth the name whom you crucified whom god raised from the dead even by him doth this man stand here before you whole now see he's he's magnifying what mark said how do you get in mark some people got to be healed that's what he's telling them right here whom you crucified whom jesus god raised from the dead even by him doth this man stand here before you whole this is a stone which said it not of you builders which has become the head of the corner neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name not title there is none other name under heaven given unto men whereby we must be saved now when they saw the boldness of peter and john and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men they marveled and they took knowledge of them that they had been with jesus can you neighbor take knowledge that you've been with jesus can your friends at work take note that you've been with jesus acts 8 but when they believed philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of god and the name of jesus christ they were baptized why they heard the name of jesus christ and what did philip do he didn't baptize him in titles he baptized the name of who he was preaching about in the name of jesus christ they were baptized both men and women then simon himself believed also when he was baptized he continued with philip and wandered beholding the miracles and signs which ever done and when the apostles which were at jerusalem heard that samaria had received the word of god they said unto them peter and john who when they were come down prayed for them that they might receive the holy ghost for as yet listen for as yet he was fallen upon none of them what the holy ghost only they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus then they laid their hands on them and they received the holy ghost acts 10 verse 43 says to him given to him give all the prophets witness that through his name whosoever believeth him shall receive remission of sins while peter yet spake these words the holy ghost fell on all them which heard the word and they have the circumcision which believed were astonished as many as came to peter because that on the gentiles us bunch of heathen dogs also was poured out the gift of the holy ghost for they heard them speak with tongues and magnify god then answered peter can any man forbid water that these should not be baptized which have received the holy ghost as well as we and he commanded them now listen they got the holy ghost they're born again believers and peter said that's okay but you still need to be baptized and he commanded them he didn't ask him amen he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the lord then pray they him to tarry certain days acts 19 it came to pass that while apollos was at corinth paul having passed through the upper coast came to ephesus finding certain disciples he said unto them have you received the holy ghost since you believed and they said unto him we got a seed we don't need the holy ghost oh i didn't say that we have not so much as heard whether there be any holy ghost and he said unto them unto what then were you baptized and they said unto john all right they were baptized by a prophet amen but not not in the name this said paul john barely baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on christ jesus and when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus amen amen now here this is a name i want you to listen to this listen this is the definition of name all right everybody wake up ah this this excites me more and preaching on the son of man for a moment here if you don't mind i'm sorry but to be so right the world is so wrong they'll fight you over this because of what misinterpreted theology ill-teaching a name our names are as incredibly important is are an incredibly important part of our what identity they carry deep personal cultural familial or family and historical connection they also give us a sense of who we are the communities in which we belong and our place in the world now what is the title i had to write it down because i couldn't get it to come up on the computer it's one it's a words it's words used before or after a name signifying a profession or a position dr sam jones father samuel dale director of operations fall bush see what i'm saying but now when he signs the check he's not going to sign director of operations he's going to sign his name [Music] he can put director of operations but if there's no name behind it it means nothing so it's words used before or after that's a title a title gives you a position so matthew what are you doing he said i'm giving god i'm telling you what jesus said this is his position he is the father he is the son he is the holy ghost but for you to get baptized the right way you got to go through my door you got to go through my lion anointing l-i-o-n anointing and then when you get into the book of acts and you get into the holy of holies you're going to baptize in the name of the lord jesus christ but our names are incredibly important part of our identity they carry deep personal and cultural family historical connection they give us a sense of who we are hallelujah jesus said in john 5 43 i come in my father's name and you receive me not if another shall come in his own name him you'll receive ephesians 3 verse 14 for this cause i bow my knee unto the father of our lord jesus christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named 3 verse 16 said let the word of christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace in your hearts to the lord and whatsoever you do in word or deed word or deed do all in the name of the lord jesus giving thanks to god and the father by him philippians 2 verse 8 says being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross wherefore god also has highly exalted him and given him a name not a position not yet give him a name which is above every name that at the name of jesus every knee shall bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father galatians 3 verse 26 said for you are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus for as many of you have been baptized into christ have put on christ not a title there is neither jew nor nor greek no is either bond or free male or female for we are all one in christ and if you be christ then you are abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise colossians 2 verse 11 says in whom also you are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands that means the circumcision of the heart and putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of christ buried with him in baptism wherein also you're risen with him through the faith of the operation of god who hath raised him from the dead um thomas if you'll give those out there's a little um we found those long time ago and it's uh well you can read it but if you look down at the bottom when you get one of these you'll look down at the very bottom or look up to the top it's really funny because they they put which of these practice were practiced by the apostles in the early church which former baptism and jesus name's over here and father son holy ghost is blank blank blank because it's not going to happen everybody all right with it while you're looking at i'll read some of it the baptism in jesus name was to the jews repent and be baptized that's acts 2 38 samaritans they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus acts 8 gentiles he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus acts 10. peter taught baptism there's none other name given whereby we must be saved acts 4 verse 12. paul taught whatever you do do all in the name of the lord jesus colossians 3 17. matthew 28 19 was a command by jesus to baptize in a name the apostles did not repeat the words of the command but they did obey it as seen in the scriptures above since father son and holy ghost are titles of the manifestation of the almighty spirit and his body the apostles understood his saving name to be jesus can you dare say that the apostles disobeyed the lord or failed to baptize properly the name of the father son and holy ghost is lord jesus christ the actions of the apostles in the book of acts prove this to be true baptism in jesus name let's continue reading this is then this is an encyclopedia britannica volume 3 page 365 the baptismal formula was changed from the name of jesus christ to the words father son and holy ghost by catholic church in the 2nd century britannica encyclopedia again everywhere in the oldest source it states that baptism took place in the name of jesus christ volume 3 page 82. the candy encyclopedia of religion the early church always baptized in the name of the lord jesus until development of the trinity doctrine in the second century that's page 53 catholic encyclopedia oh my goodness this is coming right out of the beast i mean i'm sorry right out of the catholic church own book catholic encyclopedia justin martyr was one of the early fathers of the roman catholic church and he's the one that changed if you'll read on down a little bit further hastings encyclopedia of religion name was an ancient synonym for person payment was always made in the name of some person referring to ownership therefore one being baptized in jesus name became his personal property hallelujah 2 page 377 of acts 238 new international encyclopedia the term trinity was originated by tetralum a roman catholic church father volume 22 page 477. so when the when they developed the trinitarian doctrine that's when the fathers and holy ghost baptism come it had to be the same devil it was the same devil doing the same thing all right so now let's read this and then we're gonna then we'll be ready to go from we're gonna sing a song before we go but this is what i'm going what i read out there so i'll not read it out there i'm gonna read it here for those of you that are gonna be baptized listen to this so what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound now this is paul talking to the romans god forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein know you not that as many of us as were baptized into jesus christ into jesus christ not into father son holy ghost were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that look death burial resurrection i've always said we're going to a funeral today something is going to die and you will decide whether it dies or not hello somebody you will decide when if it will die that like as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life what i say before all those that we saw back in 2015 2016 different ones we've never seen them again they did not walk in newness of life it actually made them worse so i won't just i wouldn't just go to the water and say i'm gonna get baptized because my friend did because you're identifying supposedly who you're married to to jesus christ not to a father or a son or a ghost amen even so we also should walk in newness of life for if we have been planted planted together in the likeness of his death we shall also be in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man is what crucified what happened on the day of crucifixion three people died i don't know of anybody that came off of a cross alive the sole purpose to put him on that cross was to kill him so the sole purpose of today for you to nail your sins nail those demons to that cross and forget about it that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is freed from sin now if we be dead with christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that christ being raised from the dead diet no more death hath no more dominion over him for in that he died he died unto sin once but he liveth he liveth unto god likewise reckon ye also yourselves think about this to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto god through jesus christ our lord water baptism is essential very important but you can receive the holy ghost without being baptized but i don't believe you'll receive the true baptism of the holy ghost and not want to then be baptized to make sure everything is right the way it's supposed to be to make sure that you're doing everything because you know what one little crack who is in the crack satan the devil's always in the crack because he's waiting on it to make it wider and we're not going to make that thing wider we're going to what we're going to put him to death he's going to die today in a group of people and if you've not been baptized or you want to be baptized again if you think you just got baptized because your cousin did then please be re-baptized today in the name of the lord jesus christ matthew what are you saying you got to go through me first you got to know what jesus said but you got to look to acts 2 38 and see exactly what was going on because i'm guarding this thing this precious book of acts this precious group of people matthew mark luke and john were the guards that guarded that book of acts and they didn't tell you anything different than what the book of acts was but they guarded it to make sure listen to make sure not everybody went in listen this is for everybody but everybody's not going to accept it they're going to stop when matthew 28 19 well i think i'll take this baptism and that'll be it they never got to acts 238 so they never fulfilled they think listen they i say the world the denominational world they think they're fulfilling what jesus said they are not they're not fulfilling what jesus said they got about halfway there but christian baptism was on the day of pentecost in the name of the lord jesus christ because that's who we're identified with musicians let's

tabernacle before the service started and on certain tapes you can hear it if you'll get some of the old tapes you can hear them singing that song and the place just went bonkers because because the baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ had really just came to the forefront of brother brown's ministry even in the 63 while he was preaching the seals and here they are god helping them to write this song if i were you i'd make a change and be baptized in jesus name [Music] yes to jeffersonville yes they wrote it yeah didn't that right charlotte didn't they write it on the way to jeffersonville your daddy i just hope god let him look over look over the banister of time and just see that we're still singing that song 60 years later and it still means as much to me as it did 60 years later to that group of people that were that were gathered in the tabernacle to listen to the prophet of god preach and i'd be baptized in jesus name let's bow our heads to heavenly father thank you for what you've done for us we pray lord that now as we go to the chilly waters of jordan the lord it will not be in vain but it'll accomplish the lord what it said that if we would repent and be
