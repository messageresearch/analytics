[2:57] good report of what's been going on down
[2:59] there. And uh pray for Sister Christine.

[4:11] want to go sign up downstairs so we can
[4:14] know how much food to bring and get you
[4:17] a room. All right. So, just remember

[4:23] Jun and I will be here. We'll be in Ohio
[4:25] with um service up there on

[4:47] we appreciate him. Appreciate his
[4:49] ministry. Sorry we're not going to be
[4:50] able to be with him, but we'll be able
[4:52] to uh to uh catch the service later. So
[4:56] if you have your Bibles, you can turn to
[4:57] uh again to Hebrews 5:8. Tonight, what
[5:01] we're going to do is is I
[5:05] um I was thinking a couple days
[5:08] ago, you know, we talked about a body
[5:11] thou hast prepared me last Sunday
[5:13] fitting for the resurrection and then
[5:15] also now we're talking about building a
[5:19] body because it'll be a body of Christ
[5:22] on
[5:23] earth and it will be because of someone
[5:28] comes to maturity.
[5:30] So when we say these words
[5:33] adoption tonight, I'm going to explain
[5:35] why we need to be adopted. All right?
[5:39] Through the scriptures and through the
[5:41] prophet's message. It's not just
[5:44] something that I believe I believe this
[5:48] adoption is the most important thing to
[5:53] get us to a body change. Amen. Cuz
[5:56] you're going to have to have rule over
[5:58] this. the same as Adam had rule over
[6:00] this back in the garden.
[6:03] And the Lord Jesus gave us that mandate
[6:05] for us to do that in this age. So, we
[6:07] can and we will. Someone will do that.
[6:10] Amen. In this age, I'll promise you.
[6:12] That's thus sayith the Lord. Cuz there's
[6:14] not going to be We know what happened
[6:15] now with the Pope. We don't know what's
[6:17] going on, but we'll see in the next
[6:20] couple of weeks. We'll know. Uh we'll
[6:23] know something. But we know one thing's
[6:25] for sure. I was thinking
[6:28] today the whole world speculates about
[6:32] everything. Stock market, they
[6:35] speculate. Economy, they speculate.
[6:38] Who's going to be the next pope? They
[6:40] speculate. Who's going to be the next
[6:41] president? They
[6:43] speculate. We as brides should not be
[6:46] speculating.
[6:48] We know. We have read the paper
[6:51] already. If you'll just listen to what
[6:54] the prophet said and let the Holy Ghost
[6:55] speak to you.
[6:57] Amen. But he's not going to speak to you
[7:01] if you continue to be a baby. He's going
[7:03] to speak to you in baby
[7:05] form. But he wants mature Christians.
[7:09] You do not, as beautiful and cute as all
[7:11] these babies are in this room right now,
[7:14] you do not want them to still act like
[7:16] this 10 years from now.
[7:20] Though some do.
[7:24] It's not normal though, right?
[7:26] and you know those ones. All right. But
[7:30] if you grow up to be a mature person,
[7:34] then you ought to be able to grow up and
[7:35] be a mature person in God. And there is
[7:39] a way to get there. And it's through the
[7:42] message of the hour. Now, we know it's
[7:43] through the Bible, but the Bible alone,
[7:47] listen to me, the Bible alone with your
[7:49] own personal idea will not work.
[7:53] I said with your own personal idea, I
[7:56] think
[7:58] we have had a we have a shorty of a
[8:00] message and it's going to put a body
[8:04] together
[8:05] without spot or wrinkle. You say, "Oh,
[8:07] well that's going to be somebody's got
[8:10] to be it here, right? Somebody's come to
[8:12] perfection here. Somebody's got to bring
[8:14] that headstone here. Somebody's got to
[8:17] change have enough faith to change your
[8:19] body here." Right.
[8:22] So when are we going to start believing
[8:23] that it's us? I'm just believing it's
[8:26] us. So Hebrews
[8:29] 5:8, though he were a son, yet learned
[8:32] he obedient. Now this talking about
[8:33] Jesus Christ. This talking about God
[8:35] himself in human
[8:36] flesh. All right? Remember they built
[8:38] him a body. The the Old Testament saints
[8:40] built him a body. He went into that
[8:42] body, but that body was not perfect.
[8:45] That body was a man that was dying in
[8:49] flesh.
[8:51] That's right. Hard to say, but he was
[8:53] dying in flesh because that's what died
[8:55] at Calvary, the flesh.
[8:57] Though he were a son, he was born the
[9:00] Lord Jesus Christ. He didn't have to be
[9:03] born into the family of God. He was the
[9:06] family of God and still is the family of
[9:09] God. You and I had to come across the
[9:11] chasm and be born the way we are
[9:14] here. But just think about it. You know,
[9:16] Brother Ram made a statement one time
[9:17] real quick and I'll let you be seated.
[9:19] Brother Ram said, you know, the the
[9:21] immaculate conception is not as strange
[9:25] or as
[9:26] supernatural as a regular birth. Amen.
[9:31] You think about
[9:32] it. You think about it. It was one
[9:35] sperm, one egg placed in the womb of
[9:37] Mary. You and I came here. Well, you
[9:39] understand if you're an older adult, you
[9:41] understand how we got here. Amen. You'll
[9:44] know what election is and you'll know
[9:47] what for ordination is and you'll know
[9:48] what God did before the foundation of
[9:50] the world. He gave you an angel before
[9:52] you were even born to protect you while
[9:55] you're here to get you to a place
[9:57] because you know what the the devil
[10:00] wants to kill us all. He wanted to
[10:01] listen. He tried to cut him off at two
[10:03] years old. He tried to kill Moses's
[10:05] generation. He tried to kill Jesus's
[10:07] generation by physically killing babies,
[10:10] right? Well, he's physically trying to
[10:12] kill babies now, babies in Christ. He's
[10:15] trying to make us what? Dilatory and and
[10:17] where we just don't do, you know, we're
[10:19] just in the message and uh we just come
[10:21] to church because it's a ritual and and
[10:23] the preacher talks about adoption and we
[10:26] know what adoption is in the world, but
[10:27] we don't know why in the world we need
[10:28] to be this place. Well, we're going to
[10:30] find out maybe to let the scriptures
[10:32] show us tonight. So though he were a
[10:34] son, yet learned he
[10:37] obedience obedience by the things he
[10:40] suffered. Amen. And being made perfect.
[10:44] When he came out of the tomb, his his
[10:47] soul was already perfect. Spirit was
[10:48] already perfect. His body had to be made
[10:51] perfect by what? The process of death.
[10:54] Because he didn't die for himself. He
[10:57] died for us. All right. Amen. And he
[11:00] resurrected for our justification. So
[11:01] that we can look back to the cross and
[11:03] say, "God, I know what you did. Now
[11:05] you're inside of me."
[11:07] Finish your work. Cuz we are here to
[11:09] finish the work of God. And being made
[11:11] perfect, he became the author of eternal
[11:14] salvation unto all them that
[11:18] obey him. Let's bow our heads. Dear
[11:21] heavenly father, thank you for the word
[11:23] tonight, for the singing, Lord, and for
[11:26] just us showing up. Father, I pray that
[11:27] you'd give us, Lord, the supernatural
[11:29] strength tonight. Lord, just raise us
[11:31] up, Lord. Many are tired and and weary,
[11:34] Father, and we know it's just the old
[11:36] human body, but Lord, just give us a
[11:38] spark tonight, Father, that we can hear
[11:39] from you, Father. Bless us. Be with the
[11:41] ones that are sick, the ones we call,
[11:42] the ones on the prayer list, all the
[11:44] different things, Lord. I pray that
[11:45] you'd bless the weekend coming up, Lord,
[11:47] with Brother Chris and Sister Joanna,
[11:49] that they'll get here, Lord, and have a
[11:50] good time in you, Father. will all
[11:52] gather around your word, Father, and
[11:54] say, "Did not our hearts burn within us
[11:57] as we heard what our brother had to say
[11:59] to us this weekend?" Father, forgive us
[12:01] of our sins and bless in Jesus name.
[12:05] Amen. So now Timothy, you can be seated.
[12:08] 2 Timothy 2:8 says, "Remember that Jesus
[12:12] Christ of the seed of David was raised
[12:14] from the dead according to my gospel."
[12:16] Now, wow. What about Paul? Paul didn't
[12:19] write the Old Testament, but he took the
[12:21] Old Testament and by revelation, he knew
[12:23] Jesus Christ raised from the dead
[12:25] because of what he was preaching. Now,
[12:27] remember, he's preaching it here. Jesus
[12:29] died back here.
[12:31] So, you see how the word is eternal. The
[12:33] word goes both directions. Amen. Wherein
[12:36] I suffer trouble as an evildoer, even
[12:38] unto bonds, but the word of God is not
[12:41] bound. Therefore, I endure all things
[12:44] for the elect's sake, that they may also
[12:45] obtain the salvation which is in Christ
[12:47] Jesus with eternal glory. Let's skip on
[12:51] down. If we suffer, we shall also reign
[12:53] with him. Now, I want to ask you kids
[12:56] something. when you were young and
[12:58] little and and um you were outside
[13:03] playing or or playing with a neighbor's
[13:06] kid
[13:08] and you did something wrong and your mom
[13:11] and daddy comes outside and looks like
[13:13] they had a tree in their hand, not just
[13:15] a like just a
[13:17] limb and it was it was a hand, not a
[13:20] paddle, you know,
[13:23] and they spanked you and said, "This is
[13:25] hurting me worse than it's hurting you.
[13:27] I thought my dad and mom had
[13:29] lied. Right, Sophia? Sophia's going to
[13:33] do why? Because we got in
[13:36] trouble. But and we suffered our rear
[13:39] ends and other parts
[13:42] got it. It we
[13:44] suffered. But I thank God for everyone I
[13:47] got and should have got some that I
[13:49] didn't get.
[13:51] You say, "Well, that hurt." Yes, it
[13:53] hurt. I remembered what my journey took
[13:56] me to and when I should not do that
[13:59] again, right? Because of the consequence
[14:03] that I got when I did it. Right?
[14:06] Everybody with me. So if we suffer, we
[14:09] shall also reign with him. If we deny
[14:11] him, he also will deny us. And we know
[14:15] the Bible says that if you're if you
[14:17] can't stand correction, that you're a
[14:18] bastard child. Now, that's the Bible.
[14:21] That's not what I said. That's what the
[14:22] Bible said. If you can't stand
[14:24] correction, any of us. Why? Because if
[14:27] we can stand correction, that means
[14:28] we're coming to maturity. If we can't
[14:31] stand correction, then we're just a
[14:32] bunch of babies. Cuz babies hate cor
[14:35] hate correction. Young kids don't like
[14:38] to be corrected.
[14:41] They're not saying that, man. But us
[14:43] adults are
[14:46] But they don't understand. But when will
[14:47] they understand? When they go through
[14:49] the same thing we went through.
[14:51] I'm trying to simplify this a little bit
[14:53] tonight to where we can understand
[14:54] what's the importance of adoption. Why
[14:56] do we need to come to a position called
[15:00] adoption? It's not adoption like the
[15:02] world. Everybody with me? Adoption like
[15:04] the world is if you can't have children
[15:06] and you'd like to adopt a child that is
[15:08] maybe in foster care or or in some other
[15:11] uh ward of state or anything like that,
[15:13] if you want to adopt that person, then
[15:15] you can what? It's not your kid, but you
[15:19] adopt it into your family. It becomes
[15:21] your kid legally by here on earth. It
[15:24] becomes your kid. But it didn't come
[15:27] from you.
[15:29] That's right. Now, when we come to the
[15:31] adoption of sons in the Bible, we did
[15:35] come from we come from our earthly
[15:36] parents, but our heavenly parents is the
[15:38] one that's going to adopt us. We can't
[15:40] adopt oursel. Listen, the tutor
[15:46] The tutor in Galatians didn't adopt that
[15:48] person. It was the father. That's right.
[15:51] The father is the only one that can
[15:53] adopt you into the family, not into the
[15:56] family as a family member. If you're
[15:58] born again tonight, you are in the
[16:01] family of God.
[16:04] I've been watching a movie. It's called
[16:06] The House of David and it's really
[16:08] pretty accurate. Samuel is a really good
[16:11] He's a good the guy that plays a really
[16:13] good prophet. That's the way I figured
[16:14] Samuel would be. Just a crusty old guy
[16:17] that just comes out and Have you watched
[16:19] it, Nyla? It's good, isn't it? But you
[16:22] got King Saul. You got King Saul. Then
[16:24] you got Jonathan standing there with him
[16:26] fighting battles and he, you know, all
[16:28] this. And then you've got the other
[16:31] son. We've got him in our all of our
[16:33] families, that other son or that other
[16:36] daughter that's just a happy golucky.
[16:39] He's drinking all the time and he's got
[16:40] ladies around him and he don't want to
[16:42] fight, but he's still Saul's son.
[16:48] And we get toward the end, Saul and
[16:50] Jonathan's out on the battlefield. They
[16:51] think they're getting killed. So, they
[16:53] anoint that dude king and they could
[16:56] because he was the son of
[16:59] Saul. So, as you and I are the sons and
[17:02] daughters of God, sure, we'll misbehave.
[17:08] That's right. We'll take correction or
[17:10] we won't. That's right. And we can stay
[17:13] babies, but you're not going to come to
[17:15] a full understanding of why you're here
[17:18] on this earth. You're not going to come
[17:20] to the full understanding that you are
[17:23] in the line of becoming kings and
[17:25] priests yourself.
[17:27] Not just because you're in the family.
[17:29] It's because you come to a position in
[17:32] the family. So, is everybody with me?
[17:36] Adoption is placing a Christian in a
[17:42] place where God just like Adam. Now,
[17:45] Adam wasn't adopted because he wasn't
[17:47] born. Right. Right. But but in type,
[17:53] what did God do? God said, "This is my
[17:55] son." Right. And at that time when he
[17:58] was full grown, he said, "You get the
[18:01] earth. I'll take care of heaven. You
[18:02] take care of the earth."
[18:04] All right. He had rulership over the
[18:07] earth and he was
[18:09] listened one time until the fall.
[18:14] Praise the Lord. God had fellowship with
[18:17] him every single day face to face just
[18:19] like a child. Just like a man and a
[18:21] woman and a woman and man and a woman in
[18:23] him and God. Everybody with me on that?
[18:25] Why? Because he had put he had he had
[18:28] instilled all the power on earth. He had
[18:32] given it to Adam, right? Okay. So, he
[18:35] was adopted, as you say, into the
[18:38] family. He was already a son, but he,
[18:40] like I said, remember, he wasn't a baby,
[18:41] so we can't type it all the way up. But
[18:43] remember, he did have complete rulership
[18:46] of this whole earth. Right? I'm talking
[18:48] about top to bottom.
[18:51] Amen. And being a spirit man, all right,
[18:55] come up. Being a spirit man, he could
[18:57] travel
[18:58] like a thought. Right? Remember folks,
[19:01] whatever happened in the Garden of Eden
[19:02] on the good side, that's what we're
[19:04] going back to.
[19:07] There was a great gulf. As we were
[19:08] talking Sunday, there's a great gulf
[19:09] that God God, in other words, he said,
[19:11] "Stop. I can't see what you're doing
[19:14] anymore. I cannot stand your sin, but
[19:16] I'm not going to annihilate you. I'm
[19:18] just going to make the earth be cursed,
[19:21] and whatever you took out of the earth
[19:23] is going to curse you."
[19:25] All right, everybody with me on that?
[19:27] But before that, it wasn't that way. But
[19:31] afterwards, God said, "I'm going to put
[19:33] a division, but I will come again as the
[19:36] woman's seed and put all this back
[19:39] together again. The chasm and everything
[19:42] will be brought together. You and I will
[19:44] be brought back into fellowship. And
[19:45] we're going to see a some of it now on
[19:48] the earth today. I believe we're
[19:50] fellowshipping more with God, closer to
[19:51] God than we've ever fellowship before."
[19:53] You say, "I don't see anything."
[19:56] Are you here just to see?
[20:00] Are you here just to see? I'm here to
[20:02] believe.
[20:03] I'm here to believe. And then see the
[20:06] results of what I believe. Amen. Cuz
[20:09] remember, sometimes things I believe as
[20:11] a human may not be right.
[20:15] You may not be right, but God's always
[20:17] right. Amen.
[20:20] But we've got to suffer for a little
[20:21] period of time. And that doesn't mean I
[20:23] mean
[20:24] really they suffered
[20:27] like Peter was crucified upside down.
[20:30] Right.
[20:33] Totally choking himself to death upside
[20:36] down because he didn't want to be
[20:37] crucified like the Lord. James was
[20:40] killed with a sword. One of them's head
[20:42] was cut off. One of them went to some
[20:43] other country and and he was pulled
[20:45] apart by animals.
[20:48] I'm talking about the apostles, the one
[20:50] that God anointed to take the word to
[20:53] the world. They gave their life, all but
[20:56] John the Baptist, they gave their life
[20:58] to get this gospel out.
[21:01] So, they suffered, but they're going to
[21:03] reign.
[21:05] But it wasn't. But now remember, now
[21:07] listen, you say, "Well, what's the
[21:08] difference?" Well, the difference is the
[21:09] dispensation. Their dispensation was
[21:12] that was the first church age. There was
[21:13] six more to come.
[21:15] There had to be six more messengers.
[21:17] There had to be six more groups of
[21:18] people come to bring the whole body. Cuz
[21:21] remember, we're building a body, not
[21:23] just a piece. We're building a whole
[21:25] body. Amen. And it takes the whole body
[21:29] for the whole head to sit on top of.
[21:33] So if we suffer, we'll also reign with
[21:35] him. If we deny him, he also will deny
[21:39] us. If we believe not, yet he abideth
[21:42] faithful, he cannot deny himself. In
[21:44] other words, you can stand all day and
[21:46] disbelieve and disbelieve and disbelieve
[21:48] and disbelieve. God's going to do what
[21:49] his word said.
[21:51] He's going to do it. It doesn't matter
[21:52] what you think. He's going to do what
[21:54] his word said. What we have to do is
[21:56] we've got to plug oursel into that
[21:58] revelation so that we can get the
[22:00] benefit from it. Amen. Right. And what
[22:03] little bit of suffering, like I said,
[22:04] think about those uh in the dark ages
[22:06] where the women that were expecting a
[22:09] baby, they cut the baby out of the belly
[22:11] of the ba of the woman and throw them to
[22:13] the dogs and let them eat them and the
[22:15] hogs just because they were Christians.
[22:20] And guess who what spirit they were
[22:23] under? Are you ready? They were under
[22:25] the spirit of Constantine. All right.
[22:30] And we have a Constantine right now.
[22:35] Well, praise the Lord. Anyhow, listen.
[22:38] Don't be afraid. Be vigilant.
[22:41] Okay. We're not to fear. Fear brings
[22:44] torment.
[22:46] You continue to do as you're doing. Keep
[22:48] going as you're going.
[22:51] Amen. Amen. Right. Brother Bram said,
[22:54] "If you knew if you knew that the Lord
[22:56] was coming tomorrow, plant your potatoes
[22:57] if that's what you're doing." If you're
[22:59] going to get married, go ahead and get
[23:00] married. Right? If you knew the Lord was
[23:01] coming tomorrow.
[23:03] So, we can't just do as some did many
[23:05] years
[23:06] ago. You know, Brother Ram said
[23:09] education was of the devil. So, they
[23:10] pulled all the kids out of school. This
[23:12] was of the devil and that was of the
[23:14] devil. And they just started pulling. I
[23:16] mean, here we are standing here
[23:18] today. Okay.
[23:20] Right? We're educated, some advanced
[23:24] education,
[23:25] and we're doing fine. Just don't let
[23:28] that educ education get in the way of
[23:30] your walk with God, cuz we have to be
[23:33] educated to get a real good job so that
[23:36] we can survive in this world. It's just
[23:37] the way Leosa is. All right? So, I'm not
[23:41] going to tell you to do that, but it was
[23:42] a prevalent thing when you got 16 years
[23:44] old. State of Georgia said they had to
[23:45] go to school till you were 16. Soon as
[23:47] you turned 16 years old, they pull you
[23:48] out of school and put you to work. That
[23:50] was your parents cuz they had a
[23:51] revelation that wasn't updated.
[23:54] Praise God. My dad didn't have that
[23:55] revelation. He was far advanced from
[23:58] that. He always asked a question. Why
[24:01] did all the other Brandham kids graduate
[24:03] high school and brother Brandham was
[24:04] against it.
[24:08] All right, let's continue on. Smrna
[24:11] church age. Why does he stand by? The
[24:13] reason is Romans 8:1 17. And if children
[24:17] then hes of God and joint hes with
[24:20] Christ, if so be that we suffer with
[24:22] him, that we may be also glorified
[24:26] together. For I reckon that the
[24:28] suffering of this present time are not
[24:30] worthy to be compared with the glory
[24:32] which shall be revealed in us. So
[24:35] where's the revelation going to come?
[24:36] It's going to come to us and through us
[24:39] and be us. That's the adoption. That's
[24:43] where God is going to not become silent.
[24:47] He's be going to become more vocal than
[24:49] he ever has in his whole entire life.
[24:54] His whole entire existence was to give
[24:56] his voice to a group of people and them
[24:59] be the final voice to the final age
[25:02] under our messenger. You and I are going
[25:05] to finish this thing up. Amen. Right?
[25:10] By the spoken word,
[25:13] not by an idea, not by an emotion, not
[25:16] by a sensation, but by the spoken word
[25:18] of God.
[25:20] Unless we suffer with him, we cannot
[25:22] reign with him. You have to suffer to
[25:24] reign. The reason for this is that
[25:27] character. Now, let me stop for a
[25:28] minute. Now, you take that and you read
[25:30] the Bible, and I'm sure maybe Martin
[25:32] Luther read the Bible cuz he it was
[25:35] putting in print when he put imprint
[25:37] when he was a uh a monk there in uh in
[25:40] the monastery. And then he come out and,
[25:42] you know, did what he did with the uh
[25:45] coming out making a reformation or or
[25:48] coming out and being a uh a non-atholic.
[25:51] you know, he read that scripture and
[25:53] Martin Luther was known, they said, to
[25:55] just lay out on the street and drag
[25:57] yourself across the uh the stones and
[26:00] and try to get rid of all that. Uh if
[26:02] you ever saw the movie, there's a move
[26:04] movie about Martin Luther and um it was
[26:07] made very well because it showed him
[26:08] laying on the ground trying to do
[26:11] penance in his body to get God to
[26:14] forgive him of his sins till he gets up
[26:17] one day and God strikes him and says the
[26:21] just shall live by faith.
[26:25] So Martin Luther stood up on his feet
[26:28] and he started a message. You started a
[26:30] reformation from that Catholic doctrine
[26:32] of doing penance and doing all these
[26:34] different things and sticking yourself
[26:36] and smacking yourself. You can do that
[26:38] till the day you die and it will not
[26:39] help you.
[26:42] So unless we suffer, suffer doesn't mean
[26:44] that we have to do that. It does mean
[26:46] that there's a lot of things that we
[26:48] willingly give up. When you sisters
[26:51] married your husband, I hope you
[26:54] willfully gave yourself to your husband
[26:56] because that's what a wife's supposed to
[26:57] do. Is everybody with me on that? So,
[27:00] guess what? We are the bride of Christ,
[27:02] and we've got to do the same thing to
[27:04] him.
[27:05] Give up our will, not my will, but thy
[27:08] will be done as Jesus said when he went
[27:12] into Gethsemane. You and I got to come
[27:14] to the same thing. Because brother Ram
[27:17] told us, he said, "Look, power without
[27:19] character is satanic.
[27:22] But power with, in other words, give a
[27:25] baby a key to the car and tell him
[27:29] tonight to get in the car and drive you
[27:33] home."
[27:36] That's no character, no victory.
[27:41] Right?
[27:43] So a man without character can't rain
[27:45] because the kid will drive don't even
[27:47] know how to start the car. But it's the
[27:48] same person that if he lives to 16 years
[27:50] old, they're going to get to drive a
[27:52] car.
[27:53] Everybody understand that? That's why
[27:55] we're coming to the adoption part. You
[27:58] can you can trust your kids for certain
[27:59] things. You can trust them to do certain
[28:01] things. You can trust him not to do
[28:02] certain things.
[28:04] Okay? Right? So God's the same way.
[28:07] There's only one way we can understand
[28:09] adoption is to understand our own
[28:10] regular life, our own family, our own
[28:13] upbringings, and watching our kids grow
[28:15] up as God watches our self grow up.
[28:20] Because remember the Bible tells us, I
[28:21] read in Galatians, where we are under
[28:23] tutors and governors until the time
[28:25] appointed of the father. In other words,
[28:27] you're getting ready to graduate. Are
[28:29] you going to graduate with honors or you
[28:31] just going to barely make it by the skin
[28:33] of your teeth? Right? Am I with me? So
[28:36] if you graduate by the skin of your
[28:38] teeth, you still graduate, but you're
[28:39] you just have you're you're behind as
[28:41] old saying, you're behind the eightball.
[28:44] But if you want to further your
[28:46] education, you want to get into a little
[28:48] more revelation, it's there already for
[28:51] you. You've just got to go to school.
[28:53] Right. Tutors and governors is the Holy
[28:56] Ghost plus plus apostles, prophets,
[28:59] pastors, teachers, and evangelists,
[29:02] elders, elder sisters, elder brothers
[29:04] that can help you through your life for
[29:07] anything you need. There's an answer if
[29:09] you'll just listen. Now, you may be like
[29:12] some that some has
[29:13] come, as brother Dale said, people come
[29:16] to him and say, "I'm going to change
[29:19] jobs. What do you think?" He said,
[29:20] 'Well, it ain't what am I going to
[29:22] think? You already said you're going to
[29:24] change jobs.
[29:26] You already got your mind made up. Why
[29:28] do you need my approval?
[29:31] Now, if you come and say, "Brother Dale,
[29:32] I've got these two things right laying
[29:34] in front of me, and I don't know which
[29:36] one to do." Then we'll pray about it.
[29:39] Any of your brothers, I ain't jealous.
[29:41] You ask any of the brothers, I don't
[29:43] care. I say, "Look, I've got these two
[29:45] things right here in front of my life
[29:47] and I'd like to have an answer from
[29:49] God." Then see, somebody can help you,
[29:51] but if you come and say, "Now, you know,
[29:53] I'm going I'm moving to Kentucky. What
[29:54] do you think?" Well, what Brother Dale
[29:57] said, he said, "Well, God bless you. See
[29:59] you later. You already made your mind
[30:01] up." Well, are they are we that way with
[30:03] God to where we come to God and say,
[30:05] "Look, God, this is the way I want to do
[30:06] it, but what do you think about it?
[30:09] Sorry, ain't going to happen." cuz we
[30:12] will always make a mistake. God will
[30:14] never make a mistake.
[30:16] So a man without character can't reign
[30:18] because power apart from character is a
[30:20] train wreck in other words or a car
[30:22] wreck. But power with character is fit
[30:25] to rule what? Somebody that knows what
[30:27] they're doing with the tools that God
[30:29] gives them.
[30:31] All right, I know this is simple, but
[30:33] but we need to understand why instead of
[30:35] just throwing these words out, adoption
[30:37] and all these different things, know why
[30:39] we get need to come to adoption. know
[30:40] why that that it's required especially
[30:43] in this age, right? Cuz it's in the
[30:45] Bible, right?
[30:47] And since he wants us to share even his
[30:49] throne on it. Listen, God is not sure
[30:52] God's a jealous God, but God doesn't
[30:54] want to be God alone.
[30:59] Everybody with me? He doesn't want to be
[31:01] God
[31:03] alone. Or he would have never said in
[31:05] scripture, ye are God's who the word
[31:07] comes to.
[31:08] He said he wants to share everything
[31:10] with us. Listen, Romans 8, we'll get to
[31:12] it maybe later on. Romans 8 says, "Heirs
[31:15] and joines." I read it here a minute
[31:16] ago, brother Ramy. Heirs and joiners.
[31:19] That means we get the same thing Jesus
[31:21] gets.
[31:22] If he got a body change, we get a body
[31:24] change. Amen. We just don't have to go
[31:26] to a cross like he did. We have to bear
[31:28] a cross, but we don't have to go to a
[31:30] physical cross like he did cuz he did it
[31:31] once for all. He made one sacrifice. The
[31:34] only sacrifice he's wanting from us is
[31:36] our life. Amen. That's right. And not
[31:38] death. He wants your life. He wants you
[31:41] to live for God. But remember, living
[31:44] for God and not knowing what you're
[31:47] doing is satanic.
[31:51] That's that's basically what he's
[31:52] saying.
[31:54] Okay. You can live for
[31:56] God, but you can be like the the Saul's
[32:00] youngest boy. He was just a he was just
[32:03] a what brother Ram said, raped about. He
[32:06] just didn't care about nothing. But he
[32:08] was a son. And when everybody died out
[32:10] or we go, they thought they died out. He
[32:12] was a king. Didn't matter. He was in
[32:14] line. He was in the
[32:17] family. But remember, God's not going to
[32:20] give you the key to the car and you be a
[32:22] baby.
[32:24] All right. So, let's go through the
[32:25] Bible just a little bit right here. We
[32:27] already talked about the three poles. We
[32:28] know what that is. We're in the age of
[32:30] adoption to where God, now remember, he
[32:33] has come as in the book of Matthew tells
[32:36] us, this Elijah restores everything back
[32:40] to its original owner.
[32:43] Everybody with me? Lord, don't fall
[32:45] asleep. It's only
[32:47] 7:51. I had a bad day, too. I had a root
[32:50] canal yesterday, and boy, y'all must
[32:51] have prayed well. Whatever you prayed,
[32:52] pray the same prayer for all the rest of
[32:54] you.
[32:56] Amen. I have never had a root canal that
[32:59] I couldn't
[33:01] feel. Anybody's had a root canal? You
[33:04] felt it, didn't you? I'll promise you, I
[33:08] didn't feel anything but one stick of a
[33:11] needle. That's all I felt. And they
[33:13] didn't knock me out either.
[33:15] This guy was good. And he told me he I
[33:18] said, "How long is this going to take?"
[33:19] I said, "This is a wisdom tooth. It's
[33:20] going to You got four roots on a wisdom
[33:22] tooth." Four, not two. Four.
[33:25] He said, 'I'll be done in 25 minutes. He
[33:26] said, 'You time me.' I said, 'You're
[33:29] lying.' He sat down. Soon as the Novaane
[33:33] got it got good and numb, he sat down
[33:36] and he said, "Time starts." He's a
[33:38] pretty cocky guy. 21 minutes later, he
[33:41] stood up and walked out the door.
[33:42] Finished. Done. And I walked out behind
[33:44] him. 21 minutes and didn't feel a thing.
[33:47] Thank God. Thank God. I appreciate that.
[33:50] I'll give you the guy's name and
[33:52] number. Amen. He's not cheap, but Oh,
[33:55] I've went through some of them where I
[33:57] Who was it we were talking about? Who
[33:59] was we were talking about? I mean, I
[34:01] have literally gripped the gripped the
[34:04] sides of the uh of the chair and almost
[34:06] feel the leather. Oh, you told me that's
[34:08] right, Donnie. You feel the leather
[34:09] coming up, brother John. You know, it's
[34:12] like not with that guy, man. You could
[34:14] have sing Amazing Grace and it wouldn't
[34:16] hurt nothing cuz that's what it was. It
[34:18] was Amazing Grace.
[34:20] But thank God for that. I don't know why
[34:22] we got into that, but anyway. But God's
[34:24] good. He's mindful. Sometimes you got to
[34:28] ask him, though. You can't just say,
[34:30] "Well, that's too Regina, that's just
[34:32] you." Why should you ask that? That's
[34:33] just silly. There's nothing silly in
[34:36] God. If he got you here, put you here,
[34:39] put you not sitting here, but put you in
[34:42] this age, in this message, he wants to
[34:44] hear from you. Amen. If we're to be the
[34:48] final voice to the final age, there's
[34:51] got to be somebody that's going to
[34:53] listen to you and it's going to be your
[34:56] fellow brother. But God is the one that
[34:57] hears you and said, "Hey, I am pleased
[34:59] to dwell in that vessel, hear what they
[35:02] have to say." Isn't that what Jesus
[35:04] said? They baptized him. He said, "This
[35:07] is my beloved son whom I'm pleased to
[35:08] dwell."
[35:11] If you're born again today, he's pleased
[35:12] to dwell inside of you. You say, "Well,
[35:14] I did this. I did that.
[35:18] Your soul didn't.
[35:21] Your soul can't sin.
[35:23] If it's born again, it cannot sin. It
[35:27] cannot have a bad thought. It cannot
[35:28] even have a bad day. But you see how
[35:31] much that sin though got into our body
[35:33] and our spirit realm to where it just
[35:36] motivates everything we do.
[35:39] So this adoption thing is what I know I
[35:42] was motivated my rear end was motivated
[35:44] by my mom and my dad mainly my
[35:47] mom to do better
[35:51] to not do that over again. I don't like
[35:53] doovers
[35:55] but if you remember if you take a test
[35:57] and fail it guess you go have I take it
[35:59] again.
[36:03] But we had a restoration that was to
[36:04] restore not just to from a Baptist to a
[36:09] a message
[36:10] believer, Methodist to a message
[36:12] believer, a worldly person to a message
[36:15] believer. We got a message that's going
[36:17] to take us all the way to the change of
[36:19] the body to where that everything, every
[36:21] fiber of your being one day, as it's
[36:24] beginning to now, I believe, is going to
[36:26] be transformed and you're going to be
[36:28] able to have power over it.
[36:33] That ought to make you happy. But I
[36:34] guess some of you are not happy for
[36:35] that. I'm really happy for that. Amen.
[36:39] And remember though, you got to come to
[36:41] a place to where God's not going to say,
[36:42] "All right, I've given you uh Sister
[36:45] Alicia, you've got all
[36:47] power. I want a million dollars. Give me
[36:49] a car. I you know, take me to Hawaii,
[36:52] Lord, for See, that's a baby.
[36:57] That's a baby. I'm not saying you're a
[36:58] baby. You understand that?
[37:00] But that's what a baby would do with
[37:03] that money. If you were given a million
[37:04] dollars, a baby wouldn't know what to do
[37:06] with it. A grown adult would know what
[37:08] to do with it. Invest it, put it up, buy
[37:11] a few things you want, but put it up for
[37:13] the future. XYZ. Well, same way with
[37:15] God. When you become born again, you are
[37:18] a son and daughter of God. You have the
[37:22] ability to come to adoption.
[37:26] Other than that, you have no ability to
[37:28] come to this adoption. I'm telling you
[37:29] about no ability. God's not going to
[37:32] what what brother Dell always say, God
[37:34] is not going to adopt the devil's
[37:36] children. There's no reason to because
[37:40] they're just satanic and they have
[37:41] power, satanic power. They don't have
[37:43] God's power. They have satanic power.
[37:46] But you and I are under this message of
[37:49] restoring all things. And we'll get to
[37:51] it in the seals to where when that seal
[37:54] opened, when all those seals open, sure
[37:56] it showed Jesus Christ. Amen.
[37:59] showed the showed us where the devil
[38:01] was. Now we know where the devil's at.
[38:03] He was right here
[38:06] in my thoughts, in my ideas, in my own
[38:08] religion, in my own quotes, in my own
[38:11] whatever fit my my my my
[38:15] no Jesus said, "Not my will, thy will be
[38:19] done." That's what you and I got to come
[38:21] to. Right. Right. And he will do that
[38:24] because if he conquered the cross on the
[38:28] cross before the cross in Gethsemane,
[38:31] you and I, he did it so that you and I
[38:33] can do the same thing. Right? You will
[38:36] have a Gethsemane experience. I promise
[38:38] you, if you going to take a body change,
[38:39] you'll have a Gethsemane experience.
[38:41] You'll have a place to where you'll
[38:43] stand and say, "Lord, not my will, but
[38:45] thy will be done." Amen. Not my ideas,
[38:48] not my wants, not my needs. Whatever you
[38:51] say, Lord, that's what I'll do. Can we
[38:52] do that? Well, see, that's why we must
[38:55] have adoption.
[38:58] That's why we must come out of child
[39:01] training drinking milk. Milk's good.
[39:06] But milk ain't got everything you need.
[39:09] You got to come over here and start
[39:10] eating some beans and potatoes and a
[39:12] little bit of meat. And if you're a
[39:13] vegetarian, we'll pray for you. Amen.
[39:18] I ain't never seen one had any color.
[39:20] The anointing ones at the end time,
[39:22] brother Ram said, "Look, no, it's the
[39:23] very day when this messenger," not when
[39:25] he starts on, but when he begins to
[39:26] declare his message. When did he begin
[39:28] to declare his message? When the seals
[39:30] opened, he started declaring what God
[39:35] told when he said he's coming to restore
[39:37] all things. That is the all things,
[39:39] right, brother Bob? That's the all
[39:41] things.
[39:43] All things is bringing back to where
[39:45] whenever seal open, let me finish my
[39:46] thought. Whenever seal opens, you're
[39:48] going to see what Jesus Christ a white
[39:50] horse rider run out or a red horse
[39:52] rider. But you're going to see where he
[39:54] was at and you're going to see who's
[39:55] there now. Right? Cuz you are of open
[39:59] book.
[40:00] You are the seal that was open
[40:03] now. We know we're sealed till the day
[40:06] of our redemption. But remember, you got
[40:08] a body and a spirit you got to tame. You
[40:12] listen, if you're born again today,
[40:14] you're sealed in. It's like the box car.
[40:15] You got everything in there. You got the
[40:17] box sealed. You got the conductor or the
[40:18] guy put the seal on it. And nobody can
[40:21] open that box up. Satan can't open that
[40:22] box up for nothing. It's sealed to your
[40:24] destination. But where do you want to
[40:26] go? Do you want to go just out in the
[40:27] yard and be sitting there for a while
[40:29] and not, you know, not go out there and
[40:31] unload your cargo? No. You want to
[40:33] unload your cargo yourself. Right? And
[40:36] to unload the cargo means you give this
[40:38] message or you give this eternal life to
[40:40] someone else. You you give your life not
[40:43] your life physical your life spiritual
[40:46] to preach the word of God to go
[40:49] different places to to go different
[40:51] places to go different places sing
[40:53] different songs worship do the things
[40:55] that we do here. Amen.
[40:59] We're going to preach on that and not
[41:00] not in the near future. But I want I got
[41:02] a little thought about even a body thou
[41:04] hast prepared me. But
[41:07] remember, take your natural
[41:09] body. What color is your
[41:13] blood? Is this hard? What color is your
[41:15] blood? Red. But what in your blood
[41:20] fights disease?
[41:23] Where's that at?
[41:27] You got white blood running around all
[41:28] over the place when they stick you. Do
[41:29] you got white blood running
[41:32] everywhere?
[41:34] No, your blood's
[41:37] red. But what's inside of you, inside of
[41:40] that blood cell, is something that'll
[41:43] keep you and it will heal you.
[41:46] And it's white. Yeah, the Holy Ghost,
[41:52] the white righteousness of God.
[41:54] Remember, if you see red through red is
[41:56] what? White. And that white blood cell
[42:00] is what heals you. Your red blood cell
[42:02] do not heal you. It carries oxygen.
[42:05] Everybody with me? Been studying a
[42:07] little bit on that. It it takes brain
[42:09] oxygen flows, but over here you got
[42:12] white blood cells mingled in and they go
[42:13] to one place and that's where you need
[42:15] it most. If you go to a break or or or
[42:18] you got a even a
[42:19] headache, wherever your body's paining
[42:22] or hurting, wherever your body's
[42:24] hurting, I hope somebody gets a little
[42:26] spiritual here. Whenever your body's
[42:28] hurting, that white Holy Ghost, that
[42:31] white blood cell knows where to go.
[42:35] It's the same life as the red. There's
[42:37] no two lives in there. It's the same
[42:39] life as the red, but one has one deal
[42:42] that takes care of this and one that
[42:43] takes care of this. All right, we'll
[42:45] talk about that maybe later on. But the
[42:47] very body that you live in proves that
[42:51] there's a God
[42:53] that's got everything inside your body
[42:54] that you need. That's right.
[42:57] Now remember, not in a fallen condition.
[42:59] We understand that. But Adam wasn't
[43:01] sick.
[43:03] He had blood flowing through his veins.
[43:06] He had a heart. He had a liver,
[43:10] lungs. He was a man. Right. Right.
[43:13] Listen, guess what? Jesus was
[43:16] born. Oh, he was God. He didn't have
[43:18] nothing inside of him but God. No, he
[43:20] had a liver, lung, heart, blood cells.
[43:25] But he was almighty God.
[43:30] Same way with you and I. Listen, we're a
[43:31] many membered body working
[43:34] together to bring this body under
[43:37] subjection. You cannot bring your body
[43:39] under subjection sitting at home.
[43:41] listening to tapes. Amen.
[43:45] Because the prescription that the doctor
[43:47] gave us a while back in the Bible, it
[43:49] says, "Come to church and listen to
[43:50] apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers,
[43:52] and evangelists." Okay? That's just
[43:54] pretty much the way I get my vitamins.
[43:58] That's right. That's where I get my
[43:59] vitamins at, brother D. I just I just
[44:01] can't get it anywhere else. Yeah, you
[44:02] can you can go sit under a tree and you
[44:04] can have a happy, blessed time. And it's
[44:06] happened to all of us. go down the road
[44:08] and God come into the into the car with
[44:11] you so strong. You know, one time I I
[44:13] had my hat on. I was working. I was
[44:15] driving down the road and and I was
[44:17] meditating on something and a song came
[44:18] on and I just I just felt the presence
[44:20] of the Lord and I just threw my hat out.
[44:22] I I don't know if it went out the
[44:23] window. I just lost a thing. But I
[44:26] wasn't going to have it on with God
[44:27] there with me, but he was there with me.
[44:29] I hope you have that same experience.
[44:32] It's not going to make you any better
[44:33] than anybody else. But it is kind of
[44:34] good to have God come on the scene and
[44:36] be right there visible. Visible. Not.
[44:38] Yeah. Visible. Visible in your mind that
[44:41] there is a God there.
[44:44] Listen, we get the devil there a lot.
[44:46] Why don't we glory when God comes?
[44:50] The devil's there all the time. He's got
[44:51] to move the devil out of the way to get
[44:53] to me. Y'all pray for me
[44:55] then. If you walk where angels walk,
[44:58] that's fine. Good for
[45:00] you. Now the very day when not notice
[45:04] the very day when this messenger now
[45:06] what was his what was his message the
[45:09] opening of the seals because no one had
[45:11] preached that until Jesus Jesus preached
[45:13] them in Matthew 24 2,000 years ago no
[45:17] one understood them Paul had a little
[45:19] bit of an of an understanding but not a
[45:21] complete not a restore all things then
[45:24] you come over here to our age where
[45:27] everything is going to be restored back
[45:28] to the faith of the fathers plus That's
[45:31] right. Amen. Faith of the fathers plus
[45:35] because the faith of the fathers didn't
[45:36] have the opening of the seals. They
[45:39] didn't have all the mysteries revealed.
[45:41] Anybody with me?
[45:44] But we do. And what are we doing with
[45:48] them? Are we just sitting them on a
[45:51] shelf? Bible says study to show yourself
[45:54] approved. Kids, if you don't study, if
[45:56] you don't study and you go to school,
[45:58] what's going to happen? You're going to
[46:00] get a bad grade. You're going to get a
[46:02] zero. Well, that's the same way with
[46:04] God. That's right.
[46:06] If you don't study, you're not going to
[46:08] get anything from God. Cuz listen, the
[46:11] only way you get anything from God's
[46:13] right here. Amen.
[46:15] Yeah. Press play. That's
[46:17] okay. That's all right. But this Bible
[46:20] says to come here and get your filling
[46:24] from a five-fold ministry for the
[46:27] perfecting of the saints. Let me put it
[46:29] this way. For the adoption of the
[46:32] saints. Amen. You won't get adopted by
[46:35] pressing play. That ain't the only way.
[46:39] They can say them little cute things all
[46:40] they want to. That's fine with
[46:42] me. But I was telling you Sunday, a lot
[46:45] of people are doing that. They're doing
[46:47] it by the droves. But there's something
[46:48] inside of me that says, "No,
[46:53] no, that ain't going to work." Right.
[46:56] Every time I hear that, it's like, you
[46:59] know, people heard, you know, you hear
[47:00] things and people hear things say,
[47:01] "Well, let's go to Jeffersonville. All
[47:03] you got, well, we're listening to tapes.
[47:04] That's he's our five-fold ministry. He
[47:06] Brother Brown's our prophet. He's our
[47:08] he's our pastor and all the different
[47:10] things." You know what that don't when I
[47:12] hear
[47:14] that it doesn't the symbol don't sound I
[47:17] can't hear that, brother Alex. It's an
[47:20] uncertain sound.
[47:23] Can it be to you? Are you are you
[47:24] leaning that way?
[47:27] I tell you what happened to me a couple
[47:28] days ago. I was fixing to study on
[47:31] something that that somebody had brought
[47:33] that from the um believe the sign
[47:36] people. You can go there if you want
[47:39] to. But there's a spirit with that
[47:41] thing.
[47:42] That's right. There's a spirit you don't
[47:44] need. If you're weak, you definitely
[47:46] don't need that spirit because it's
[47:48] praying on weak
[47:49] people. Right. But brother Luis, I open
[47:53] my tablet to pull up that website. I I
[47:58] had I was I had a couple hours to do
[48:01] nothing. Believe that I made
[48:05] time. I was going to study this out to
[48:08] see if, you know, if what they're saying
[48:10] is true or or how you can combat that or
[48:12] how you and with my hand up to the Lord,
[48:17] something spoke to me and said, "Don't
[48:19] touch it. Don't ever go there."
[48:22] And when I shut that book, I don't know
[48:24] how I stood up out of that chair, but I
[48:25] stood up out of that chair and I was
[48:27] gone. Completely away from that thing,
[48:29] whatever that was that was going on. You
[48:31] be careful.
[48:33] It's okay to study certain things. It's
[48:35] okay to study to make yourself approved.
[48:37] But don't you start diving into that
[48:38] stuff because I'm telling you that is a
[48:40] spirit that will get a hold of you.
[48:43] Amen. And if you don't have the Holy
[48:46] Ghost, it will absolutely trap you.
[48:48] That's what's happening. Them people
[48:49] that left the message, they don't have
[48:50] the Holy Ghost. Can't.
[48:54] Like I said before, there ain't nothing
[48:55] in here that says that's right. All
[48:58] right. They they tell me this after
[49:01] that. I'm telling you folks, you can
[49:05] find fault. They found fault in Jesus.
[49:09] They called him a You hang around
[49:12] sinners too much. You hang around
[49:14] prostitutes. You don't wash your hand
[49:15] when you eat. Well, count me in that
[49:17] group.
[49:19] I wash my hands all the
[49:23] time. But they put that on him though,
[49:26] brother Bob. They put that on him saying
[49:28] you ain't God just because you don't
[49:29] wash your hands. Yeah, that's right.
[49:33] Are you are you with this group over
[49:34] here or or or you don't believe the way
[49:37] we do so you're be elabub. They called
[49:40] God be elabub. What do you think they
[49:41] going to call you? They going to find
[49:44] fault with you. They found fault with
[49:45] him, brother John. And he was perfect.
[49:48] But remember, they couldn't get past the
[49:50] humanity, watching Jesus eat, watching
[49:53] him sleep, maybe getting sick, throwing
[49:56] up. I'm just being real. Hey, go to the
[49:59] bathroom.
[50:00] Jesus had to go to the bathroom.
[50:03] He was that human. So they saw
[50:07] that. It's like Jesus said when we were
[50:10] watching The Chosen, if you remember, he
[50:11] was in the courtyard with his mama,
[50:12] remember? And he was getting like at the
[50:14] end of the end of the um season whatever
[50:17] before this one coming up and he's
[50:19] talking to his mother and he said,
[50:20] "Mother, they don't see me because of
[50:22] this. I'm human." She said, "I know you
[50:26] are. I changed your diaper."
[50:28] So, you know, and they had a little
[50:30] chuckle with it, but that's the truth.
[50:33] That's the same way with me and you.
[50:35] They'll pick us apart if you'll let
[50:36] them.
[50:38] Just don't get a hold of that thing and
[50:39] don't let it get a hold of you.
[50:43] There's nothing to it. It's all lie and
[50:44] vanity.
[50:46] You can find fault. Listen, why don't
[50:48] they find fault in Billy Graham? I was
[50:49] thinking about this the other day,
[50:50] Brother Bob. Why don't Why have they not
[50:52] found fault with Benny Hinn and Billy
[50:54] Graham and oral Roberts? Oh, sure they
[50:56] found some little things. But man,
[50:58] they're after brother Brandham just cuz
[50:59] he brushed his teeth. I mean, I you
[51:02] know that ain't true, but that's about
[51:04] as silly as a as it is. Amen. So, let me
[51:08] just warn you, just be mature when you
[51:10] look look at something.
[51:13] If you don't understand this
[51:15] message, then don't you don't need to
[51:17] delve into that. Without the Holy Ghost,
[51:20] you better leave it alone. It is a very
[51:23] strong spirit because you know what it
[51:24] is? It's a spirit of iniquity.
[51:27] And Bible tells us iniquity shall abound
[51:29] in the end time. And the love of many
[51:32] will wax cold. And they're so cold till
[51:36] they hate this message. They hate
[51:38] anybody that has anything to do with it.
[51:40] And they sure hate the prophet. Amen.
[51:46] First pull was healing. Second pull was
[51:48] prophesying. Third pull was what? The
[51:49] mysteries revealed. And that's what
[51:51] we're under now. The mysteries can only
[51:53] be revealed by a prophet. Now remember,
[51:57] a prophet can't give you a revelation.
[52:01] He can bring you to a revelation.
[52:05] Everybody with me? You don't get a
[52:07] revelation for brother Brandham. Amen.
[52:10] You get a revelation from God that says
[52:13] that ain't nothing but the truth.
[52:16] My messenger has come and put it
[52:18] together so you can understand it.
[52:20] That's right. That's why John took the
[52:23] book from the mighty angel. He didn't
[52:25] take it from the seventh angel
[52:27] messenger. Sorry.
[52:29] He took it from Christ.
[52:33] Christ told him to eat it up. The
[52:36] seventh angel messenger was the voice to
[52:38] get us to it. In the days of the voice
[52:40] and seventh angel when he been be the
[52:43] mystery of God to be finished. So why
[52:45] didn't that just finish it all up? No,
[52:47] the whole scene was then then then God
[52:50] then Jesus or
[52:52] Christ says here John eat the book. He
[52:55] didn't give it to the angel and the
[52:57] angel gave it to I mean the seventh
[52:59] angel and the no the seventh angel's
[53:02] voice is what gave us the opportunity to
[53:04] get to God.
[53:07] So give me that
[53:10] cuz I'll promise you you you'll find
[53:11] fault with everybody. Anything you can
[53:13] find fault with.
[53:17] But I'd rather let this speak and not
[53:21] this. That's right. Please let it go
[53:23] into your heart, into your soul. Let it
[53:26] go right here.
[53:28] Cuz right here you're going to read.
[53:30] Listen, it's like I said before, how
[53:32] many seen Jesus? How do you know he
[53:34] resurrected?
[53:37] There's three places they say is the
[53:38] tombs in Israel. Three. It only had to
[53:40] be one. It couldn't be three of them.
[53:43] crucifixion might have been here, might
[53:45] have been over there.
[53:48] Do you have to know exactly the stone
[53:50] that the that the that the blood fell
[53:52] on? No, you do not. We're not going to
[53:55] get finished with this
[53:59] message. Now, watch. So, the third pull
[54:02] is what? Here, here we're we're coming
[54:03] to adoption. So, the third pull is the
[54:05] opening of the word. Now, how are you
[54:07] going to open the word if you don't know
[54:08] what it is?
[54:10] All right. You don't you you've had this
[54:11] Bible in your hand for 2,000 years
[54:14] almost. Well, say 1500 years. This has
[54:18] been in print and been where you can
[54:20] read it. Why did it take a prophet in
[54:23] the end time to come and restore this
[54:26] back? It didn't restore. It didn't
[54:28] restore one word in this book.
[54:31] Didn't add didn't take from it. What did
[54:32] it take? It took the man's
[54:36] filter, his carnal knowledge of the word
[54:40] and changed it to the truth of the word
[54:43] of God. That's what this message is.
[54:45] That that's what this message produced.
[54:48] It was exactly what Jesus spoke. It was
[54:51] exactly what Paul spoke. It was exactly
[54:54] what the Old Testament saints spoke.
[54:56] That's right. We were restored back.
[55:02] Now, the Bible says it'll be to totally
[55:04] lost it to be the bride of the church.
[55:06] We know
[55:07] that. But remember when brother Brandham
[55:09] was preaching the seals, and I got been
[55:11] to it many, many times. And
[55:15] uh he's uh he's telling them there on
[55:18] the sixth
[55:19] seal on questions and answers. He said,
[55:21] "It's not for you." All right? They gone
[55:24] from you. Remember, I'm just going to
[55:27] say this by the word of the Lord. They
[55:30] weren't adopted to hear that message.
[55:32] That's right.
[55:34] They were still Pentecostal babies.
[55:36] There were still some people that
[55:37] thought Brother Brandon was it and that
[55:38] was all. Cuz when he died, a lot of them
[55:40] people that was sitting went back to
[55:42] their denomination. That's the truth.
[55:45] There was only a few that started what
[55:47] is now called the message.
[55:50] There was no message churches till way
[55:52] later. Like I mean 1968
[55:56] because brother Mike Canada had and and
[55:58] then Athens in 1969 and here in 1971 I
[56:01] don't know somebody may have been u
[56:03] earlier but I don't know that they were
[56:05] I know this started in 71 that was only
[56:07] 6 years after the prophet left called
[56:10] the message church or a message church.
[56:13] So it was to a different group of
[56:15] people. It was not for the dispensation.
[56:18] Well, remember God brings things. What?
[56:21] God does. It
[56:24] reveals it and then makes it manifest.
[56:27] Amen. He did it through a prophet. Sure,
[56:30] he revealed it. May have just been for
[56:32] him at the time, but he revealed it to
[56:34] us and then he's going to make it
[56:36] manifest. What? Through us.
[56:39] The culmination of our belief is going
[56:40] to be a body change. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[56:45] So adoption is to set, put or place. To
[56:48] set, fix, establish, to set forth, to
[56:51] establish, or to ordain. Now look, Adam
[56:53] had authority. We know that for a fact.
[56:56] He had all authority of all the whole
[56:58] world. And he could travel like a
[57:00] thought. So he could go here and here
[57:02] because he was in spirit. Then what did
[57:03] God do? He planted a garden east of Eden
[57:06] and put Adam in a place because he put
[57:08] him in flesh. He couldn't fly
[57:11] around. But God did that for a purpose.
[57:17] so that everything could head up there
[57:19] and there be a fall. He didn't make it
[57:21] happen. He knew it would happen. All
[57:23] right. So, let's look and see what the
[57:26] Bible tells us just real quick and we'll
[57:27] be we'll be finished in a few minutes.
[57:29] Look in the book of Malachi 4. Now,
[57:31] here's Malachi 4:2 right before Malachi
[57:34] 45 and 6. But unto you that fear my name
[57:37] shall the son of righteousness arise
[57:40] with healing in his wings. And you shall
[57:42] go forth and stay a calf.
[57:48] Grow up as calves of the
[57:52] stall. Ephesians 4:14. That we
[57:55] henceforth be no more children tossed to
[57:59] and fro and carried away with every wind
[58:01] of doctrine. What? By the slight of
[58:04] preachers. Right.
[58:08] And men, the Bible says, of reprobate
[58:10] mind
[58:11] and cunning craftiness. They're smart.
[58:14] The devil's smart. He knows how to
[58:16] approach this message. He knows how to
[58:18] get people out of it. Amen. But he will
[58:21] not ever get a son of God out of this
[58:24] message. Never will he do that. Never
[58:27] will he pry a message believer out of
[58:29] this. Out of this. Never. Amen.
[58:33] cuz we're his.
[58:37] We're his children in line of adoption.
[58:39] Amen.
[58:41] We're sealed,
[58:43] protected till the day of our
[58:45] redemption. Amen. You got to know that
[58:48] though. You can't be tossed to and fro.
[58:51] Well, I don't know if this is right.
[58:52] Well, I don't know if that's right. I
[58:54] don't know what this is, but I don't
[58:55] know what that is, but I do know what
[58:56] that is, but I don't really know what
[58:58] this person's saying. Come
[59:00] on. Paul stood up one day and he said,
[59:03] "If an angel from heaven comes and
[59:06] preach any of," in other words, comes
[59:08] and says
[59:10] anything different than what I'm
[59:12] preaching to you, let that angel be
[59:16] cursed.
[59:17] Wow.
[59:20] Wow. And brother Brandham stood up and
[59:23] basically said the same thing. He said,
[59:24] "If God, if I have preached this
[59:26] message, if I have preached you the
[59:28] truth tonight," he said, "let God come
[59:29] on the scene and we'll see what he'll
[59:31] do."
[59:33] Right?
[59:34] There was not one time, that's what I
[59:36] told that brother. I said, "You tell me,
[59:37] we talking about
[59:39] vindication. You talk, you tell me one
[59:41] time that brother Brown stood and
[59:43] said, "Well, it don't look like he's
[59:46] coming tonight. I think we'll just
[59:49] close. Find me one out of,00 sermons.
[59:53] Find me one where brother Brandham, in
[59:54] other words, as we call it, God left him
[59:56] hanging.
[59:59] Why? Because he was a prophet. God
[1:00:02] respected that prophet because the
[1:00:03] prophet respected his word.
[1:00:07] He might have made mistakes. He called
[1:00:08] himself stupid. He almost killed himself
[1:00:10] twice. Almost was a murderer. Everybody
[1:00:14] with me on that? right? Wanted to kill
[1:00:17] those children.
[1:00:20] But God wouldn't let him cuz he had a
[1:00:22] purpose in his life.
[1:00:25] He wasn't protecting brother Brandham.
[1:00:26] He was protecting the gift.
[1:00:29] He was protecting the gift that was
[1:00:31] going to come through that man cuz he
[1:00:34] knew that he could come to adoption. You
[1:00:36] and I are going to have to come to a
[1:00:37] place to where we know I tell you
[1:00:39] everybody in this room, in this in this
[1:00:42] house, you can come to adoption. You can
[1:00:44] come to a place where you're settled,
[1:00:46] grounded, and when God speaks to you,
[1:00:49] you can put a stamp on it and say,
[1:00:50] "That's it." Amen.
[1:00:55] Cunning craftiness whereby they lie and
[1:00:57] wait. Listen, they're
[1:00:59] there. They lie and wait to deceive. But
[1:01:03] speaking the truth in love, may what?
[1:01:06] Grow up into him and all things which is
[1:01:08] the head, even Christ.
[1:01:11] Mark
[1:01:12] 4:7 talking about the swer of the seed
[1:01:15] and some fell among thorns and the
[1:01:18] thorns grew up.
[1:01:21] Remember the tears are going to grow up
[1:01:23] also
[1:01:26] cuz you remember Satan I don't believe
[1:01:28] Satan knows everything. If he's all
[1:01:30] knowing you'd be God.
[1:01:33] I think he reacts to what God
[1:01:36] does. Brother Bob, I think that I'm I'm
[1:01:39] pretty sure he re because remember he's
[1:01:42] not original. He can't bring He can't
[1:01:44] make something.
[1:01:45] He only perverts what God's already
[1:01:47] made. He cannot create anything. So he's
[1:01:51] a he's a copycat. So the thorns are
[1:01:54] going to grow up along with even
[1:01:56] remember Jesus said, "Let them all grow
[1:01:57] up." And what did he say? Let them all
[1:01:59] mature.
[1:02:00] Cuz once you let them mature, you'll
[1:02:02] know what's a weed and you'll know
[1:02:04] what's wheat or you'll know what's good
[1:02:06] and what's bad. Right. Burn this bunch.
[1:02:08] Gather this into the harvest. That's
[1:02:11] what's happening right now. Amen. Right
[1:02:14] now. That's what's happening right now.
[1:02:17] It's being separated. The thorns. But
[1:02:19] what happened? The thorns grew up,
[1:02:21] choked it. Choked what? Choked the
[1:02:24] plant and it yielded no fruit. Others
[1:02:28] fell on good ground and did yield fruit.
[1:02:30] Now, what is fruit? Fruit's the
[1:02:34] culmination of what was planted.
[1:02:38] Everybody with me? Right? If you planted
[1:02:40] ochre, what's going to come to the end
[1:02:42] of that plant? Ochre.
[1:02:45] All right. You plant an apple, you're
[1:02:47] going to expect an apple to come out to
[1:02:49] the end. When God plants the seed of
[1:02:51] eternal life in you, he expects the
[1:02:53] fruit to come out on the end of the
[1:02:54] vine.
[1:02:56] Everybody with me?
[1:02:59] So did yield fruit that sprang up and
[1:03:03] increased and brought forth 30, 60, and
[1:03:06] 100fold. John 12:4, "Verily, verily, I
[1:03:10] say unto you, except the corn of wheat
[1:03:11] fall into the ground and die, it abideth
[1:03:14] alone. But if it die, it bringeth forth
[1:03:17] much fruit." Let's put the inside of all
[1:03:20] that together. That plant came up
[1:03:24] and grew and produced fruit.
[1:03:28] Because the seed died,
[1:03:30] there was fruit.
[1:03:33] Matthew 5:48, "Be therefore perfect,
[1:03:36] even as your father in heaven is
[1:03:38] perfect." That word perfect doesn't mean
[1:03:40] you're not going to ever do anything
[1:03:42] wrong. It e it means complete or of full
[1:03:45] age, brought to its end.
[1:03:51] Remember what brother Brown told us?
[1:03:53] What was the seventh seal?
[1:03:55] What's the seventh seal? The end of all
[1:04:00] things.
[1:04:04] What is it? He said it's the end of the
[1:04:05] struggling world. End of this. End of
[1:04:08] that. It's the end of your struggling.
[1:04:11] If you'll know where you're at, brought
[1:04:13] to its end, finished, wanting nothing
[1:04:16] necessary to completeness. Now, that's
[1:04:19] an adopted son and daughter of God.
[1:04:22] Perfect. That which is perfect.
[1:04:24] consumate human integrity and virtue of
[1:04:26] men. Look, full
[1:04:29] grown. Be therefore fullrown even as
[1:04:31] your father which in heaven is fullrown.
[1:04:34] That all right?
[1:04:37] 1 Corinthians 13:9. For we know in part
[1:04:40] and we prophesy in part. But when that
[1:04:42] which is perfect,
[1:04:47] complete,
[1:04:49] restore all
[1:04:52] things, then that which is in part shall
[1:04:55] be done
[1:04:56] away. When I was a child, I spake as a
[1:05:00] child. I understood as a child. God
[1:05:03] doesn't mind you being a child. He minds
[1:05:06] you staying one.
[1:05:08] That's right. I thought as a child, but
[1:05:10] when I became a man, I put away childish
[1:05:14] things.
[1:05:16] Well, he didn't shake my hand. We've
[1:05:18] been having this problem. This devil has
[1:05:20] come to church here for the past several
[1:05:21] months. You got my
[1:05:26] seat. Praise the Lord. Anyhow, I think
[1:05:28] I'll bring I'll drink some water while
[1:05:29] y'all talk about that. That was already
[1:05:32] open. One of y'all drink this.
[1:05:40] You got my
[1:05:44] seat. It has been an issue. I'm sorry.
[1:05:46] It just has.
[1:05:49] But this is not only is it Where' Josh
[1:05:52] go? Did he fall
[1:05:55] out? Get here early.
[1:06:00] That will alleviate all your problems.
[1:06:02] You can have your seat if you'll get
[1:06:04] here. I know it's not on, but I was
[1:06:06] leaning up to where maybe I could get
[1:06:08] it. The Come
[1:06:11] on. Watch here. 1 Corinthians 14:20.
[1:06:14] We'll close. Brethren, be not children
[1:06:17] in understanding.
[1:06:22] How be it in malice be ye children.
[1:06:27] I don't like this. I'm afraid I Well,
[1:06:31] that she got my seat. Two Sundays in a
[1:06:33] row. Two.
[1:06:36] Look at them. They spread out like like
[1:06:38] a big old eagle. Well, praise the Lord.
[1:06:40] That's what we are.
[1:06:44] Make their little nest and their kids'
[1:06:45] nest and their grandma's nest and
[1:06:47] grandpa's nest. They take up the whole
[1:06:52] seat. Get here before they do
[1:06:56] cuz maybe you don't have no kids
[1:07:00] and you can get here early, right?
[1:07:07] But the Bible tell Bible tells us, "But
[1:07:09] in understanding, be men."
[1:07:13] In understanding, be men. Be mature. God
[1:07:16] wants you to be mature. Listen, God
[1:07:18] doesn't mind you crying out to him. We
[1:07:20] cry out to God all the time. But he
[1:07:22] don't want us to cry out about every
[1:07:24] little situation.
[1:07:27] That's right. Okay. Every little situ.
[1:07:29] No, he wants you to take this Bible and
[1:07:32] say, I stand on the word of God.
[1:07:37] But in understanding be men. Hebrews
[1:07:41] 5:13. For everyone that uses milk is
[1:07:44] unskillful, can't drive the car.
[1:07:49] Though he have a a brain, though she has
[1:07:51] hands, though they have a heart, though
[1:07:53] they have a little bit of intelligence,
[1:07:56] they're not mature enough to drive a
[1:07:58] car.
[1:07:59] That's why there's limits on, you know,
[1:08:01] the drinking age is 21. Why? Because
[1:08:03] they think you're kind of stupid, but
[1:08:06] they think you're at 21, you know what
[1:08:08] you're doing. At 16, you know how to
[1:08:10] drive. They off a few years,
[1:08:13] but why are those laws in place? Those
[1:08:16] laws are in place because that man looks
[1:08:19] at somebody and says,
[1:08:21] "Yula, you're just not mature enough to
[1:08:23] vote. You just don't have the, you know,
[1:08:26] not yet." And you sure can't drive
[1:08:29] daddy's big old truck.
[1:08:31] But now if you get daddy's age and you
[1:08:33] go through and you take what? Training,
[1:08:35] right? You get your
[1:08:38] license cuz you tell them and show him
[1:08:41] that you can do
[1:08:42] it. Then you can drive your daddy's big
[1:08:44] old
[1:08:45] truck. I saw him today. There was 15
[1:08:48] cars behind him. He drives like an old
[1:08:50] woman.
[1:08:55] An 80,000lb one.
[1:08:58] with about what 20,000 chickens on his
[1:09:00] truck. 5,000 chickens. 5,000. You should
[1:09:03] have went up that hill
[1:09:05] faster. We always meet cuz my male route
[1:09:07] and his chicken routes the same. We
[1:09:09] usually meet twice. He's goes down, I
[1:09:11] come up, and I'm going down. He's coming
[1:09:12] up that big old long hill at 3:23 and he
[1:09:15] just chugging along and them people
[1:09:16] right behind him. They love you,
[1:09:18] brother. They love you. All of them had
[1:09:21] their windshield wipers on and water for
[1:09:22] some reason. There was things hitting
[1:09:24] the windshield. You know, for everyone
[1:09:26] that uses milk is unskillful in the word
[1:09:28] of righteousness, for he is a babe. God
[1:09:30] doesn't mind you being a baby.
[1:09:34] He has he has got patience that will
[1:09:37] quit being babies,
[1:09:39] but strong meat belongth to them that
[1:09:42] are of full age. Even those, now watch,
[1:09:46] even those who by reason of use.
[1:09:52] Practice makes perfect. Amen.
[1:09:57] Ula, you're going to have to take a
[1:09:59] course. You're going to have to learn
[1:10:01] how to how to almost put that truck
[1:10:03] together, take it
[1:10:05] apart. But they'll train you to do that.
[1:10:07] And then they'll take you out on a
[1:10:08] course and they'll watch you, right? And
[1:10:11] if you pass that test and if you don't
[1:10:13] knock all the cones over and run
[1:10:14] yourself off in a ditch somewhere or hit
[1:10:16] the instructor, don't ever do that.
[1:10:18] Don't ever hit the instructor. Then
[1:10:20] what'll happen is they'll give you a
[1:10:23] certificate with a seal on it that says
[1:10:26] you're authorized to drive that big old
[1:10:28] truck your
[1:10:29] daddy's. Let's try small cars first. But
[1:10:32] that's the way God is. God's the same
[1:10:35] way. If a tutor and a go if if teachers
[1:10:38] watch over us, according to Galatians,
[1:10:41] if we're watched over by teachers, the
[1:10:44] Holy Ghost,
[1:10:46] all right, we're watched over by him all
[1:10:48] the time. Brother Ram, we'll read it
[1:10:50] next time we come here where brother Ram
[1:10:52] says the Holy Ghost will go back to the
[1:10:54] father. And this is a dramatization.
[1:10:56] There's not three people,
[1:10:58] okay? But it's a dramatization that the
[1:11:01] Holy Ghost is the what? It's the spirit
[1:11:04] that's around you and in you watching
[1:11:06] your every move that you make. And he
[1:11:08] goes back to the father and says, "Hey,
[1:11:10] this guy is doing everything you told
[1:11:12] him to do."
[1:11:14] He's passing every test every time. Then
[1:11:18] God says,
[1:11:19] "Okay, we got something we're going to
[1:11:22] do.
[1:11:23] We're going to take him up on the
[1:11:25] mountain or we're going to take him out
[1:11:26] in the middle of the square or we're
[1:11:28] going to let something happen in his
[1:11:29] life that I'm going to put my seal
[1:11:31] approval on him and you're going to see
[1:11:33] that that's where you're going to hear
[1:11:34] from me. That's what he did with brother
[1:11:36] Brandham on on the mountain here and the
[1:11:39] other day when I read you about the
[1:11:40] sword fitting the hand that was his
[1:11:43] adopt was his placing.
[1:11:46] I just believe that and I believe all of
[1:11:49] us have to come to a sword in the hand.
[1:11:51] You don't have to be up on a mountain
[1:11:52] and you don't have to be in
[1:11:54] Arizona, Georgia. But anyway, uh you
[1:11:58] don't have to be where a sword fits your
[1:12:00] hand. You got to see the sword is the
[1:12:01] word.
[1:12:03] And this has got to fit your hand. You
[1:12:05] got to make your hand fit this.
[1:12:08] Okay? Not this fit your hand. Your hand
[1:12:11] must fit this. And what it is is because
[1:12:14] this is molding you. It molded brother
[1:12:17] Brandham into a place to where when he
[1:12:18] grabbed that sword, it fit. He said
[1:12:21] perfectly.
[1:12:23] So the word fit perfectly in his hand.
[1:12:26] And what did he do with that? He give it
[1:12:28] to me and you. But strong meat belongs
[1:12:31] to them that are full age, even those
[1:12:32] who by reason of use have their senses
[1:12:37] exercised to discern both good and evil.
[1:12:41] Ephesians 2:20. We'll be done. Come on,
[1:12:44] musicians. Ephesians 2:20. and are built
[1:12:47] upon the foundation of the apostles and
[1:12:49] prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the
[1:12:52] chief cornerstone, in whom all the
[1:12:55] building fitly framed together. What
[1:12:59] groweth? Why would we want to build a
[1:13:02] house and and just build a foundation
[1:13:03] and walk away from it and say, "I got a
[1:13:05] house." No, you're just getting started.
[1:13:08] It's part of the house. It's a very
[1:13:09] important part of the house, but it's
[1:13:11] not the house.
[1:13:13] Same way with you. You're a house.
[1:13:15] You're a tabernacle.
[1:13:19] groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord.
[1:13:23] In whom you also are builded together,
[1:13:25] watch for a habitation of God through
[1:13:30] the spirit. This is my beloved son in
[1:13:32] whom I'm pleased to dwell. And then he
[1:13:35] took Jesus on the mountain and said, "If
[1:13:38] you're going to get it, this is who
[1:13:40] you're going to get it from." He
[1:13:43] adopted him into the family. Let's stand
[1:13:45] our
[1:13:47] feet. So that's what he said. While he
[1:13:49] yet sp. Behold, a bright cloud
[1:13:50] overshadowed them. Behold, a voice out
[1:13:52] of the cloud said, "This is my beloved
[1:13:54] son in whom I'm pleased to dwell. Hear
[1:13:58] ye
[1:14:00] him." We got to come to that where
[1:14:03] brother says one time, he says, "Now
[1:14:05] hear ye them." It's the bride speaking
[1:14:09] now, but it's not going to be the bride.
[1:14:12] is not going to be a babbling baby.
[1:14:14] Right? Because
[1:14:17] remember when you get to Revelations
[1:14:20] 19, you've come from a bride to a wife.
[1:14:23] A wife is the maturity of the bride. And
[1:14:27] his wife hath made
[1:14:29] herself
[1:14:31] ready. You got to put the garment on.
[1:14:34] The Lord will give you the garment. The
[1:14:36] Lord will give you the opportunity. But
[1:14:38] you got to put it on.
[1:14:41] That's right. You got to say, "Be it
[1:14:42] unto me according to thy word." You got
[1:14:45] to believe sometimes things that you
[1:14:46] don't even at the moment believe
[1:14:48] yourself.
[1:14:50] Come on.
[1:14:52] But remember, Abraham against hope
[1:14:55] believed in hope and made that hope into
[1:14:57] faith. And that faith took him to a
[1:15:00] promised son. You and I in the end time
[1:15:03] are going to have to produce the
[1:15:05] promised son. Not a baby, but a full-g
[1:15:08] grown man called the son of man in bride
[1:15:11] form. God bless you. Let's sing a song.
[1:15:14] Amen. Let's sing. Let the worshippers
[1:15:16] arise.
[1:15:18] Let's worship him.
[1:15:21] [Music]
[1:15:23] Father, I see that you are
[1:15:27] drawing a line in the
[1:15:31] sand and I want you to be
[1:15:35] [Music]
[1:15:36] standing holding your hand.
[1:15:41] So let your live in me.
[1:15:45] Yes, let it live in me. This is my
[1:15:50] prayer.
[1:15:52] This is my
[1:15:55] plea. Let the
[1:15:57] worippers
[1:16:03] arise. Let the sons and the daughters
[1:16:07] sing.
[1:16:12] I'm
[1:16:13] surrendering my
[1:16:20] all. I'm surrendering to the
[1:16:25] king. Let the worshippers
[1:16:27] arise. Oh, let the
[1:16:31] worshipers arise.
[1:16:38] Let the sons and the daughters sing.
[1:16:46] I'm
[1:16:47] surrendering my
[1:16:50] [Music]
[1:16:54] all. I'm surrendering to the king.
[1:16:59] [Music]
[1:17:04] Oh father, I hear it growing
[1:17:09] louder. The song of your
[1:17:12] redeemed. As the bride of every
[1:17:17] nation is awakening to
[1:17:21] sing. From our hearts there comes an
[1:17:26] anthem. Oh, hear the praises ring. This
[1:17:30] is our
[1:17:32] song, a song to our king. Why? Cuz we're
[1:17:36] sons and daughters of God.
[1:17:39] Don't let the devil ever tell you that
[1:17:40] you're anything different.
[1:17:44] You're predestinated son and daughter of
[1:17:46] God.
[1:17:48] You're predestinated to adoption.
[1:17:51] You're predestinated to be able to look
[1:17:53] at your children
[1:17:56] and pray for them and the devil back
[1:17:58] off.
[1:18:00] That's your job. That's something for
[1:18:03] you to do.
[1:18:05] You say, "How do you know that?" The
[1:18:07] Bible just told you because of you
[1:18:09] exercising your faith,
[1:18:13] you'll be able to do this. You exercise
[1:18:16] your faith. Let the
[1:18:20] shame.
[1:18:24] Do you tonight? Do you surrender
[1:18:25] everything? I
[1:18:27] surrendering my all.
[1:18:32] Yes,
[1:18:33] Lord. Oh, I surrender to the king.
[1:18:40] [Music]
[1:18:42] Let's say yes now. Oh, we see this. See
[1:18:46] the lamb in Revelations 5, the most
[1:18:50] sublime scripture in the Bible. When
[1:18:53] that lamb takes the book with your name
[1:18:56] in it, redeems you and makes you kings
[1:19:00] and
[1:19:00] [Music]
[1:19:02] priests. He's done it for
[1:19:05] us. Song of
[1:19:07] eternity. Worthy is the
[1:19:11] lamb. Hallelujah. Worthy is our
[1:19:15] king. Let the worshipers.
[1:19:21] Yes Lord. Great father.
[1:19:24] Lord let us see more of you Lord in
[1:19:26] oursel Father and our brothers and
[1:19:27] sisters
[1:19:28] Lord let us be Lord as the one stood
[1:19:31] that day and said look on us. Silver and
[1:19:34] gold have I none but in the name of
[1:19:37] Jesus Christ rise up and walk. Father,
[1:19:40] what a time, Lord. A time that we're
[1:19:43] looking at right now. It's in our face,
[1:19:46] Father. We're looking at you, Lord.
[1:19:50] And you said you'd do it, Father. You
[1:19:53] said you'd be with us. You'd never leave
[1:19:54] us, Lord. In this dark hour, Lord, we
[1:19:57] know that things are coming, Lord. But,
[1:20:00] Father God, we know that you gave us,
[1:20:03] Lord, the right vehicle. You pressurize
[1:20:06] us for this time, Lord, so that we can
[1:20:09] be ejected out of here, Father. Lord,
[1:20:11] give us strength for the things that we
[1:20:13] need. Be with us, Lord, this weekend,
[1:20:15] Father, Bless, Brother Chris, as you
[1:20:17] speak to us, Father, this weekend, Lord.
[1:20:20] I pray that you grant, Lord, the healing
[1:20:22] of the bodies of the ones that are sick,
[1:20:24] Lord, that they'll just reach up now and
[1:20:26] touch you, Father. And Lord, if we need
[1:20:29] salvation, Lord, that they'll reach up
[1:20:30] and touch you for that, Lord. We thank
[1:20:33] you for the blood. We thank you for the
[1:20:34] things you give us, Lord. We thank you
[1:20:36] for the Holy Spirit that's come among
[1:20:38] us, Lord. This in earth and vessels now.
[1:20:42] And Lord, that's absolutely taking over
[1:20:44] our lives. Father, Lord, be our
[1:20:47] headship, our husband. Father, I pray,
[1:20:49] Lord, that you'll be with us now, Lord.
[1:20:53] In Jesus name we pray, Lord.
[1:20:56] Amen. Yes. Sing it to him.
[1:21:00] Oh, and let the sons and the daughters
[1:21:03] sing. Oh, to be a son and daughter of
[1:21:06] God, to be a child.
[1:21:09] I'm
[1:21:09] surrendering my
[1:21:11] [Music]
[1:21:15] own. I surrender to the king.
[1:21:23] I was meditating the other day on the
[1:21:25] book of Esther. You know, we've all been
[1:21:26] through it.
[1:21:28] The word God's not even mentioned in the
[1:21:30] book of Esther. It's a
[1:21:31] story. It's a story about a little
[1:21:33] Jewish
[1:21:35] girl that comes to a place to where the
[1:21:38] king is absolutely captivated by this
[1:21:42] one girl cuz she put on the garment
[1:21:45] right. She walked right. She did things
[1:21:49] right. Thousands of other girls were
[1:21:53] involved in it. He picked one because of
[1:21:56] her
[1:21:58] character. And I like what um I believe
[1:22:01] it was
[1:22:03] Mori. She said, "I'm going in to see the
[1:22:06] king. My people are being are going to
[1:22:09] be destroyed." She found out what was
[1:22:10] going to happen. That Hmon was going to
[1:22:13] grab a group of people and they were
[1:22:14] going to go in and kill the Jews. And
[1:22:16] they were totally defenseless. Didn't
[1:22:18] know anything about it. It was going to
[1:22:19] be a surprise
[1:22:21] attack. All right.
[1:22:24] So she put on a dress that pleased the
[1:22:26] queen the the
[1:22:27] king. And she said, "If I go in, if I
[1:22:31] die, I die." Cuz if you if you went in
[1:22:34] to see the king, even though that was
[1:22:36] his wife, if you went in to see the king
[1:22:38] without him holding out the scepter, you
[1:22:41] died. They took you out and killed you
[1:22:42] right then. That's how reverent the
[1:22:45] kingship
[1:22:47] was. But she put on her best.
[1:22:51] She knew what the king
[1:22:53] liked. She
[1:22:55] knew that he wouldn't turn her down cuz
[1:22:58] she put on everything he liked.
[1:23:01] Everything he wanted, she put it
[1:23:03] on. And before she went in, Mori told
[1:23:07] her said, "You may
[1:23:10] die." In other words though, he said,
[1:23:12] "But you were
[1:23:15] born for this
[1:23:17] moment right here.
[1:23:20] You were born for this moment right here
[1:23:24] to present yourself to the King of
[1:23:28] Kings. And oh God, if you're dressed
[1:23:31] right, act
[1:23:33] right, speak
[1:23:36] right, God is so pleased with us, folks,
[1:23:39] till he's going to automatically, that
[1:23:40] king, I don't think that king even
[1:23:42] hesitated. He hadn't seen her for 30
[1:23:45] days. He hadn't seen her for 2,000
[1:23:48] years.
[1:23:50] He hadn't seen her for 2,000 years. This
[1:23:52] king was wanted to see his bride. But
[1:23:54] his bride was a little apprehensive
[1:23:55] because she knew she was going in
[1:23:59] uninvited. But I believe that brother
[1:24:01] John always in the king's heart, he was
[1:24:03] waiting on that queen to walk through
[1:24:04] that door.
[1:24:06] He was waiting on her to come at the
[1:24:09] right time. And as soon as she walked
[1:24:11] in, the Bible says he took and put out
[1:24:13] his scepter. Amen. And some
[1:24:18] people in the old Jewish tradition, that
[1:24:21] scepter was a
[1:24:23] cross. He had a cross on the end of it.
[1:24:25] Had a bowl and a cross. And what did
[1:24:28] Jesus do? He stuck out the cross. He
[1:24:32] said, "I can't kill you." In other
[1:24:34] words, I've already died for you. Come
[1:24:36] on in. What do you want?
[1:24:40] She said, "Oh, my people, they're going
[1:24:43] to die. Hmon has the devil has given us
[1:24:47] all these problems. The devil is fixing
[1:24:49] to put us in a trap. The devil is fixing
[1:24:53] to destroy my
[1:24:57] people." He said, "I can't change my
[1:24:59] word."
[1:25:04] Cuz remember the the the Mes and
[1:25:06] Persians, that was the law. If whatever
[1:25:08] a king said, you couldn't change
[1:25:10] it. He didn't change this.
[1:25:14] But he said, "I tell you what I'll
[1:25:16] do." He said, "You send
[1:25:19] letters. You send letters out and you
[1:25:23] defend yourself." See, a lot of times
[1:25:25] God is not going to win your battle for
[1:25:27] you,
[1:25:32] but he said, "You do that and you defend
[1:25:35] yourself." Isn't that what God did for
[1:25:38] us? He said, "I'm giving you something
[1:25:42] to defend yourself with. The devil's
[1:25:44] coming. I know he's coming on this day.
[1:25:46] I'm telling you when he's coming at you.
[1:25:48] I'm telling you what his tactic is. But
[1:25:50] I'm going to give you something to fight
[1:25:53] with." Didn't change it. He just showed
[1:25:56] it where it was at. Showed her where it
[1:25:58] was at. It was in his word that he
[1:26:01] spoke. And guess what happened? They're
[1:26:03] still celebrating that now. that now
[1:26:05] it's the day of pureim which means that
[1:26:07] one day when Hmon went out and he was
[1:26:09] going to defeat him and I mean he had
[1:26:10] them all together he was going to squash
[1:26:12] them all he just didn't know that God
[1:26:15] had given the
[1:26:16] bride the plan
[1:26:19] and she wrote
[1:26:20] letters of them
[1:26:24] 66 of
[1:26:26] them and said you can defend yourself
[1:26:29] I've give you I know when he's coming I
[1:26:31] know his tactic I know when he's going
[1:26:33] to show up this is the Well, guess what?
[1:26:35] You know what happened the rest of the
[1:26:36] story? They wiped them out. And then
[1:26:39] they came and hung Hmon on the same
[1:26:42] gallows that Hmon was going to hang
[1:26:44] Morai on. What a mighty God we serve.
[1:26:48] All mind's clear. The the the Old
[1:26:51] Testament, don't ever do away with it,
[1:26:53] man. It's got so many good allegorories
[1:26:55] and types and shadows and and like I
[1:26:58] said, the book of Esther had the word
[1:26:59] God's not even me in it. It's really not
[1:27:01] a religious thing. It's just two, you
[1:27:03] know, three or four people interacting
[1:27:05] with each other, but it's really full of
[1:27:07] good nuggets. But she was born for a
[1:27:11] time like
[1:27:12] this. You and I were born for the time
[1:27:14] like this right here. This is a home
[1:27:16] stretch now, folks. This a home stretch.
[1:27:19] I believe the baton has been handed to
[1:27:21] the last person. I'm not talking about
[1:27:23] person. I'm talking about bride person.
[1:27:25] And we're going to finish this thing.
[1:27:27] Let's bow our heads. Lord, thank you for
[1:27:28] all things. Again, Lord, I pray that
[1:27:30] you'd be with each one. be with us on
[1:27:32] the highways, Lord, home. Be with us
[1:27:33] this weekend as we come together, Lord,
[1:27:35] on Saturday and Sunday and worship you,
[1:27:37] Father, with Brother Chris. Give him the
[1:27:38] words to speak to us, Father. That'll
[1:27:40] help each and every one of us. Just
[1:27:41] bless us now. Be with the ones that are
[1:27:43] sick. Raise them up for your honor and
[1:27:44] glory. Lord, thank you for your word.
[1:27:46] Thank you for your many blessings you've
[1:27:47] given us, Lord. Thank you for the Holy
[1:27:48] Ghost that leads us and guides us into
[1:27:50] all truth. Father, we pray in Jesus
[1:27:52] name. Amen. God bless you. You're
[1:27:53] dismissed.
