[1:48] this is a real interesting interesting
[1:54] day today this is the supposed to be
[1:59] like the most darkest day of the year
[2:01] and you know everybody's supposed to be
[2:04] celebrating the the darkness of the
[2:07] world that we're celebrating the light
[2:11] rejoicing in the light tonight so thank
[2:17] you ready amen so if you have your
[2:19] Bibles tonight let's look in the
[2:22] scripture tonight and kind of want to if
[2:27] I can I want to kind of gear this some
[2:29] of this to the young people tonight and
[2:35] you just
[2:36] you know there's something that that's
[2:38] been on something you know just the Lord
[2:43] shows you things and you know you when
[2:47] you're when you're listening to brother
[2:48] branham there's things that he says it
[2:51] catches your attention and then you hold
[2:54] on to that and for some reason you can't
[2:56] get away from it's just like something
[2:57] you catch that you get that fault and so
[3:00] this one I've been looking at and you
[3:04] know it has to do with tonight you know
[3:09] this is this is Halloween and when you
[3:13] look at the historical part of what
[3:16] Halloween's about and those things you
[3:20] know one of the things that you find out
[3:23] when when you look at Halloween is one
[3:27] of the that one of the definitions or
[3:30] one of the sayings about as it's called
[3:34] the celebration of fear and you know
[3:39] it's all about fear and you know
[3:41] everything has to be haunted and spooky
[3:46] and you know fear and fright and all
[3:49] these different things you know and you
[3:52] know you know there was a there was a
[3:55] time in history when when there was a
[4:00] lot of darkness and a lot of blackness
[4:02] but you know in the midst of that God
[4:05] sent a man to bring forth light and if I
[4:11] don't I don't know if y'all know this
[4:12] but you know today is the day of the
[4:15] beginning of the Protestant Reformation
[4:18] today is the day that Martin Luther
[4:20] nailed the 95 theses to the door he
[4:24] wrote the 95 theses and you know he
[4:26] blasted the Catholic Church for their
[4:28] stance on many different things which
[4:30] was today and you know you know here was
[4:33] a man that living in a world full of
[4:36] darkness and yet God sent him to bring
[4:39] the light and you're less than one of
[4:42] the things that I want to look at
[4:44] tonight my title is called
[4:45] being fearless in a world of fear
[4:49] and that's what I won't look at tonight
[4:51] because you know God called us to be
[4:53] fearless to be faithful to have faith in
[4:57] what he said and not and not cower to
[5:00] the to the things of the world but you
[5:03] know they're out celebrating a lot of a
[5:06] lot of these darkness but you know what
[5:08] God sent light to us amen so tonight as
[5:13] we look to the scripture we just want to
[5:15] speak to the author before we start
[5:18] reading our scripture so let's just all
[5:20] bow our heads our gracious Heavenly
[5:22] Father we thank you for tonight Lord we
[5:24] just thank you for all that you've done
[5:25] for us
[5:26] Lord for it no matter what goes on in
[5:31] the world Lord Lord the the scripture
[5:35] tells us in men's hearts will be failing
[5:38] for fear but Lord Lord you sent us a
[5:41] word Lord you sent a word to us to
[5:45] encourage us Lord to show us the things
[5:47] that were going to take place in order
[5:49] to not be afraid not to listen to what
[5:52] the devil has to say Lord but to look to
[5:55] you and to see what you have for us and
[5:57] we we know that your word is yeah and
[6:00] amen and father we pray tonight you just
[6:03] come and help us Lord take these
[6:04] thoughts Lord I can't I can't do it in
[6:08] myself lord I just pray that you just
[6:10] come and help us Lord speak to the
[6:12] people tonight Lord Jesus and we just
[6:14] pray that you just meet each need that's
[6:17] represented in this building tonight
[6:18] Lord you know what's on each heart and
[6:20] what's in each life Lord we just commit
[6:23] it to you and just pray that you just
[6:24] anoint the speaker and the hearers
[6:27] tonight we ask in the name of Jesus
[6:28] Christ amen amen
[6:31] second Timothy chapter one and verse
[6:36] seven says for God hath not given us the
[6:39] spirit of fear but of power and of love
[6:42] and of a sound mind be not thou
[6:47] therefore ashamed of the testimony of
[6:49] our Lord nor of me his prisoner but be
[6:53] thou partaker of the afflictions of the
[6:54] Gospel according to the power of God who
[6:58] has saved us and called us to an holy
[7:01] calling
[7:04] not according to our works but according
[7:07] to his purpose and grace which was given
[7:13] us in Christ Jesus before the world
[7:16] began but has now made manifest by the
[7:19] appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ who
[7:21] have abolished death and hath brought
[7:23] life and immortality to light through
[7:25] the gospel we're in - I am appointed a
[7:28] preacher an apostle and a teacher of the
[7:30] Gentiles for the which calls also suffer
[7:34] these things nevertheless I am not
[7:36] ashamed for on whom I have believed and
[7:39] I am persuaded that he is able to keep
[7:41] that which I have committed unto him
[7:44] against that day and one other scripture
[7:47] I said first John 4:18 says there is no
[7:53] fear in love but perfect love casteth
[7:56] out fear because fear hath torment he
[7:59] that feareth is not made perfect in love
[8:02] any man you may be seated I was I was
[8:09] looking some time back you know this is
[8:13] a this is a second time I've got to
[8:15] preach on a Halloween here at the church
[8:19] you know them to know what God has done
[8:26] in our day to know what - see what God
[8:31] has done and to know what God has done
[8:34] and what God is doing and why do you
[8:36] what he's going to do to know the whole
[8:38] plan from the beginning to the end and
[8:41] you know one of the things I love about
[8:44] what what Paul's writing to Timothy here
[8:47] because you know he lays it down I think
[8:50] so perfect is that you know he said I'm
[8:54] not ashamed we shouldn't be ashamed of
[8:57] the testimony of the Lord we shouldn't
[8:58] be ashamed of what God has done to know
[9:01] what God has done he said he said they
[9:03] saved us and called us to a holy calling
[9:06] not according to our works and I'm so
[9:10] thankful for that for every day because
[9:12] it's not my works but it's but it's him
[9:15] but according to
[9:16] his own purpose and grace which have
[9:18] given us in Christ Jesus before the
[9:20] world began and I'm so glad that you
[9:24] know it's already been settled before it
[9:26] ever started you know so I mean we we
[9:31] live in a world that is engulfed in fear
[9:34] and you know everything that that this
[9:37] world is about is about fear you know
[9:41] we're in the in the political realm and
[9:45] the political time now and you know
[9:46] everything everybody's so worried about
[9:48] what's going to take place but you know
[9:51] it's one group is you know they're
[9:53] trying to press on people's emotions
[9:57] working on people's emotions about
[10:00] what's going to take place and you know
[10:02] you get these you get these flyers in
[10:05] the mail you get emails you know we got
[10:07] to stop this group from doing this and
[10:09] we got to stop that group from doing
[10:11] that well then when you when you step
[10:12] back and look and the in the great
[10:14] scheme of things you realize you know
[10:17] God has his hand in all of this and we
[10:19] know what's going to take place so it
[10:21] doesn't matter which group gets in it's
[10:23] still going to come out to the same end
[10:25] just like they say it's rearranging the
[10:27] deck furniture on the Titanic we know
[10:30] what the end results going to be it
[10:32] doesn't matter who does what it's still
[10:33] going to come out the same way but you
[10:36] know everybody is dealing on you know
[10:38] there it's just a fear-mongering you
[10:39] know it's just working on everybody's
[10:41] emotions everybody's so fearful of
[10:43] what's going to take place well you know
[10:45] what it doesn't matter what takes place
[10:46] because if you're a child of God you
[10:48] know what's going to take place because
[10:51] you know what we're one aware if we're
[10:53] he is then you know what he knows what's
[10:55] going to take place and he's already got
[10:56] a plan and a purpose for us and it
[10:59] doesn't matter what takes place you know
[11:02] when it just like Joe but he was laying
[11:04] on there on the ash heap and all the
[11:06] things that he went through you know he
[11:08] stood there and said though God slay me
[11:10] yet I'll trusting you know all the
[11:12] things that job had to go through in his
[11:14] life and all the things that he suffered
[11:15] and everything you know what he put his
[11:17] trust in God and you know God came and
[11:20] spoke to him and showed him who he was
[11:22] and you know where were you when when
[11:25] the morning star saying together and the
[11:27] sons of God shouted for joy we're
[11:28] worried
[11:28] you well you know what that's the same
[11:30] question for you and I where were you
[11:32] you know because if we if we come from
[11:35] the mind of God and we're going back to
[11:37] the mind of God then you know what we're
[11:38] in the mind of God today and so the
[11:40] steps every step that you take you the
[11:42] scripture tells us that it's ordered of
[11:44] the Lord even when you mess up you know
[11:46] what if you're a child of God he's
[11:48] coming for you why because you know he
[11:50] don't allow you to sin and an act
[11:53] unbecoming of a Christian without him
[11:55] coming and chastising you he brings you
[11:58] back to where you need to be and you
[12:00] know that's the same thing you know we
[12:01] have to have we have faith and have and
[12:04] have a reassurance that we know who we
[12:07] are and you know the devil won't doesn't
[12:09] want you to to let you know to believe
[12:11] that and see who you are and the the
[12:18] quote that I want to read is from the
[12:19] this is from the seal of the Antichrist
[12:22] in 1955 and brother Branham says so now
[12:27] the day that we're living in is the
[12:28] question mark over the entire world
[12:30] he said I've traveled a great deal of
[12:32] the world for the Lord and in there not
[12:35] only in America but everywhere if
[12:37] there's an unsettled peace everywhere
[12:39] the whole world seems to be shaking it
[12:41] scared like something's fixing to happen
[12:44] well that shows something is fixing to
[12:47] happen he said where don't want to scare
[12:50] you I'm not here to do that I'm here to
[12:53] show you a way to keep from being scared
[12:56] and not to scare you but we must face
[12:58] facts and we might and we must do that
[13:01] we must so we find out that over the
[13:04] world there is great fear sitting upon
[13:07] all peoples in this Atomic Age when it's
[13:10] just ready for everything to happen and
[13:13] me and he says and he skips down he
[13:16] talks about the church's cooling off and
[13:18] and the different things he says men
[13:21] come in anointed of the Holy Ghost they
[13:24] preach with everything that's within
[13:25] them and the people walk walk right out
[13:28] and walk away as if nothing had ever
[13:30] happened just unconcerned he said
[13:32] there's got to be a reason for that and
[13:34] if you'll study this this tells us what
[13:37] the reason it do you know that the
[13:38] scripture says there will be a time in
[13:41] the last days when there
[13:42] be a famine strike the land not for
[13:44] bread or water but for hearing the Word
[13:46] of God and that men would go from east
[13:49] west north or south seeking to hear the
[13:51] word of God and fail to find it just
[13:53] think of the times we're living in and
[13:55] we're living in that time I believe when
[13:58] the prophets spoke that he foresaw the
[13:59] United States of America because it's
[14:02] the only place that I know of would meet
[14:04] that description in this day and so this
[14:09] is this is the day that we're living in
[14:11] that great fear is upon the world but he
[14:16] said I don't want you to be afraid I
[14:17] don't want you to be fair but we got to
[14:19] see the facts but you know it was so
[14:22] interesting that he said you see the day
[14:24] and hour that we live in but he but you
[14:26] know brother Branham goes right to the
[14:27] scripture and he says what's the problem
[14:29] why is there fear in the land why is
[14:31] there such fear on the people because he
[14:34] said there will be a famine in the land
[14:36] he said not for bread or for water but
[14:38] for hearing the Word of God so what is
[14:40] it when you're not in the word then
[14:42] there's fear upon the land because they
[14:44] turned the word down so that's why
[14:45] there's the only place to have hope to
[14:47] have faith is in the word and if it's
[14:50] not in that then we are living in fear
[14:54] we live in fear many people live in fear
[14:58] you know they're so bound by so many
[15:01] things but you know it's for us to hold
[15:05] on and believe what God sent us you know
[15:09] the world is so full of fear everything
[15:12] everything is controlled by fear you
[15:16] know it's it's just even in your
[15:18] subconscious realm when you don't even
[15:20] realize what people are saying to you
[15:23] they're they're sowing seeds in your
[15:25] mind to be fearful what is it what is it
[15:32] today
[15:33] tell me something you know watch if you
[15:37] get on YouTube
[15:38] if you've ever you know you get on
[15:40] something like YouTube and every so
[15:42] often and they run these old commercials
[15:43] about stuff you buy a magazine and they
[15:46] don't matter what kind of magazine it is
[15:48] if you get in a magazine the first thing
[15:50] they won't do is I want to have these
[15:52] full-page advertisements and what is it
[15:57] full-page advertisements they're trying
[15:58] to sell you something but what you you
[16:01] go in there and you start looking at
[16:02] them and what's the first thing they
[16:03] want to do do you have a tree watery
[16:05] eyes
[16:06] do you have heartburn do you have this
[16:08] do you have that do you have this
[16:10] problem that does this bother you no no
[16:14] no but you know what is it doing is
[16:15] someone something into your mind but
[16:19] people but what is it the first thing

[16:22] to give you all these symptoms do you
[16:24] have these symptoms well if you have any
[16:28] of these symptoms talk to your doctor
[16:30] and what do they do well I don't know
[16:38] maybe I do and you know what in the next
[16:41] person yeah and then all of a sudden you
[16:43] know they said well you know what I
[16:44] didn't feel like that last week but you
[16:46] know this week I'm starting to feel like
[16:47] that and you know I read that
[16:48] advertisement you know they said you
[16:50] know if you have these symptoms this
[16:51] could be the problem or the news comes
[16:55] on and they start telling everybody well
[16:57] you know what they have this disease
[16:59] that are that's attacking kids and
[17:01] putting them in the hospital and the CDC
[17:03] can't figure out what's wrong with it
[17:04] and it's flu-like symptoms well you know
[17:08] what there's plenty of hyper contracts
[17:10] in the world that moms are out there and

[17:21] might have that disease at the CDC ain't
[17:22] figured out what it is there's like no
[17:26] Junior just got the sniffles but what is
[17:31] it it's sowing something into your mind
[17:33] that people feed on that and every
[17:38] little thing that happens somebody's
[17:39] like well I don't know I don't know
[17:43] about that and so you know it just
[17:45] continually grows you know there's
[17:48] there's people in the world they say
[17:49] well they say well I'm normal but you
[17:51] know what that stays in the back of your

[19:21] you know the whole world is is so-and-so
[19:25] brother I'm said is such a neurotic
[19:27] state and everybody is so bound by fear
[19:31] and you know all all of these fears and
[19:35] worry and anxiety you know the the world
[19:40] is so in such a turmoil you know brother
[19:46] brems said that psychiatrists or doctor
[19:48] in the psychiatrist which you know to me
[19:54] that makes me feel makes me reassured
[19:58] about going to a psychiatrist you know
[20:04] he's like oh this medicine works real
[20:06] good I thank it myself
[20:10] you know I don't know you know just
[20:12] weird you know it don't build any
[20:14] confidence you know but you know we said
[20:17] we see these sanction and you know what
[20:20] one of the things that brother Brent
[20:21] them talked about and I want to talk
[20:27] about a little bit tonight is you know
[20:29] there's a there's a word called phobia
[20:32] and a lot of people knows word about
[20:35] about phobias and a phobia is an anxiety
[20:40] disorder that a person develops and
[20:46] usually it has an irrational basis to it
[20:51] and sometimes it has an irrational
[20:55] circumstance to it you know you know
[20:58] there's people that worry about things
[21:00] happening that you know you're really
[21:03] not likely for it to happen to you but
[21:08] you know people they get these things in
[21:10] their mind you know a lot of people you
[21:11] know you know very common phobias people
[21:14] have is you know people are you know
[21:16] they're afraid of snakes they're afraid
[21:17] of heights they're afraid of spiders you
[21:20] know there's a lot of different things
[21:22] you know people are afraid of being in
[21:24] and confined spaces and you know all
[21:27] these different things well you know
[21:28] when you start when you start looking at
[21:30] things in people's life you know and you
[21:32] start looking at some of these things
[21:34] yeah I'm convinced that people in the
[21:37] world are scared of everything there are
[21:41] people that have a phobia because you
[21:44] can go online and start reading about
[21:45] phobias and honestly I think people are
[21:49] have a phobia to everything that you can
[21:52] think of there are there are people that
[21:55] just they are absolutely terrified of
[21:59] things that have no rational basis for
[22:02] it to happen but you know they are they
[22:05] get so right I mean there are some
[22:07] people that are so afraid of something
[22:10] taking place that you know they don't
[22:12] want to leave their house and you know
[22:16] there are certain and and you know I
[22:18] just want to read you here's us a few
[22:19] things that that just just reading
[22:22] these links and and you think about
[22:25] these these phobias that people have and
[22:29] you wonder you know it doesn't make any
[22:31] sense you know there was there was a
[22:34] lady that I was reading about a young
[22:36] lady she wanted to be a schoolteacher
[22:37] and she couldn't be a schoolteacher and
[22:41] one of the reasons why she never could
[22:44] be a schoolteacher is because she's a
[22:46] she as she has a phobia to cotton to
[22:51] cotton balls to anything white and
[22:54] fluffy if it's not even if it's
[22:56] polyester or anything like that if it's
[22:59] a cotton ball
[23:00] she can't even pull the cotton ball out
[23:02] of a aspirin bottle she's all bundled up
[23:06] and using forceps or tweezers to pull
[23:09] the cotton ball out of the aspirin
[23:11] bottle because she can't touch it and
[23:18] you know what's so amazing these people
[23:20] realize that this is irrational there's
[23:23] absolutely no basis for this but you
[23:25] know what they still believe that there
[23:29] are people in this world that are afraid
[23:31] of wood there are people in this world
[23:35] there are afraid of synthetic fibers if
[23:38] you put if you've got somebody close to
[23:41] a piece of polyester they would
[23:43] absolutely pass out I mean oh you know
[23:50] and you know what's so amazing is when
[23:52] you look at some of these things and you
[23:53] start reading people are afraid of the
[23:55] color yellow they don't want anything
[24:00] anything to do with the color yellow
[24:02] number the number thirteen people people
[24:07] will actually run the other way from the
[24:09] number thirteen I thought when they were
[24:12] talking about number thirteen that's
[24:13] like if you have any cash if the serial
[24:16] number has 13 in it you want to get rid
[24:17] of it I will leave you of your phobia I
[24:21] will leave you of your stress we are
[24:23] here to help you I will help you out
[24:29] with that people people are people are
[24:31] are they are scared of the number eight
[24:37] they are there everything honestly Pete
[24:40] anything that you honestly anything that
[24:42] you can think of people have a fear of
[24:44] and it's in a SOAM I mean honestly there
[24:48] was there was one there was one person
[24:50] they couldn't they couldn't touch
[24:52] anything anything ahead that was slimy
[24:55] anything slimy that they felt was it was
[24:58] a little bit slimy has a certain feel to
[25:01] it it just freaks them out so they said
[25:04] lotion or hint and sanitize or anything
[25:07] like that just freaks them out you think
[25:11] you think that you think that people I
[25:13] mean there are people in the world that
[25:15] that absolute can't handle these things
[25:18] and you know what's so amazing these
[25:21] people woke up and you know they
[25:23] absolutely know this as irrational but
[25:27] you know what that fear to them is more
[25:30] real than you or sitting in that chair
[25:32] that fear to them is more real you know
[25:35] what if you put something if somebody
[25:37] had a phobia and they were and they
[25:39] hated the color yellow you could have
[25:41] put a cobra in the room with them and
[25:43] something yellow and they would go over
[25:45] there to the cobra that's get away from
[25:46] the yellow it wouldn't matter what I
[25:52] mean people would run out in front of a
[25:53] train to get away from some of these
[25:55] things and they know that it's
[25:59] irrational is there's nothing behind it
[26:03] and you know what I thought what I was
[26:06] thinking about all this you know we can
[26:08] come to the house of God we can hear the
[26:09] word preach and you know what we will
[26:11] sit and listen and live in a world that
[26:13] we are bound by things that the devil is
[26:16] created and put in our minds that are
[26:18] irrational that's contrary to the Word
[26:20] of God and you know what we will still
[26:22] believe in it we will live in a world
[26:26] that this devil has created in our minds
[26:28] and Ren believe it and walk in it when
[26:31] the Word of God said that we are
[26:33] creators we create you know what we
[26:37] can't change the environment in which we
[26:39] live but you know what we create the
[26:41] atmosphere in which we live
[26:44] we create the atmosphere well because
[26:47] you know what we are many creators but
[26:50] you know what those people they live in
[26:51] something that's created in their mind
[26:54] that they believe that that is real yeah
[26:58] just like tonight everybody's out
[27:01] trick-or-treating and all these
[27:02] different things and they're living in a
[27:04] world that don't and they don't even
[27:07] realize that this is nothing but demonic
[27:10] powers in a way that the devil can get
[27:13] to you
[27:15] simple things just like watching video
[27:18] games and playing this and that and not
[27:20] realizing the underlying forces behind
[27:23] it you know years ago I took a class in
[27:29] college that had to do with theatre and
[27:33] movies it was a general ed class and you
[27:36] know one of the things that I thought
[27:38] was so amazing when I started watching
[27:40] all these different movies was people
[27:43] didn't realize the things that Hollywood
[27:48] put in movies as far back as the 30s and
[27:51] the 40s and what's so amazing is when
[27:56] you sit and watch these videos and all
[27:57] of a sudden these people start bringing
[27:59] these seeds out and you start saying
[28:01] here's a little pinch of this and a
[28:02] little piece of that and a little piece
[28:03] of this and you know what he got past
[28:05] the censors and you know it was so
[28:10] amazing if you go back and watch movies
[28:13] from years ago there is no if you and I
[28:19] would just sit down and watch it and had
[28:21] no concept of what was going on you
[28:23] would never ever ever realize there's a
[28:27] homosexual spirit in them you would
[28:31] never you would never pick up on it but
[28:34] as soon as somebody brings that first
[28:35] scene out and shows you something and
[28:37] say this was what year this came out and
[28:39] you catch the spirit behind that and
[28:42] this is a university showing this and
[28:45] all of a sudden you start seeing this
[28:47] and this and this and all of us said
[28:52] people people wonder why brother Bentham
[28:55] talked about he said it wasn't juvenile
[28:56] delinquency he
[28:57] it was parent delinquency but you know
[29:01] what they were certain things that was
[29:02] sewed in the movies years ago this sowed
[29:05] seed into people's minds that
[29:08] automatically people started to believe
[29:11] certain things and it was in your
[29:14] subconscious you didn't even realize it
[29:17] you know red Ram said you don't go on
[29:19] The Devil's ground he's a real slicker
[29:22] he'll get past you you won't catch it
[29:25] and people say well you know it's okay
[29:28] it's okay well the next thing you know
[29:30] you know just like he talked about one
[29:32] generation came along and you know
[29:33] they've done these certain things and
[29:36] then you know it was the girls and then
[29:40] you know he talked about the flappers
[29:41] and you know the different ones as they
[29:43] came along the girls you know this one
[29:45] done this one and this one done that one
[29:47] and all of a sudden you start to see the
[29:49] the moral decay of the women how they
[29:52] started to change all these things that
[29:54] took place and people didn't realize
[29:56] what was taking place in in them in the
[29:58] movies and TV and there were times that
[30:05] even they were showing us in this in
[30:08] this class censors would stand up and
[30:12] say you can't put that on TV and they
[30:14] said sure we can said it's here's your
[30:16] book and we don't break any of your
[30:20] rules but those people could see those
[30:24] sensors could see the spirit behind that
[30:27] stuff he could hate they could see it
[30:29] they said what we didn't break your
[30:30] rules and you know what it was put on TV
[30:34] see people you know sometimes we let
[30:37] things we don't because if we're not
[30:40] vigilant of what we're doing things
[30:42] catch our attention and we get
[30:44] fascinated or fixated on things and not
[30:46] realizing how much they're destructive
[30:50] and we catch sane and you know we think
[30:53] well it's not going to hurt yeah it
[30:55] can't hurt it gets your attention it
[30:59] catches you
[31:03] and we have to we have to be vigilant on
[31:06] what what's going on around us we have
[31:10] to be we have to be always mindful of
[31:13] the word and and keep our eye on him
[31:16] that we know what the devil is trying to
[31:19] do to us but you know many times people
[31:22] have come and they have missed what
[31:26] God's trying to do and I want to try to
[31:35] try to find these right quick but you
[31:42] know brother branham there's a there's a
[31:45] few times that brother Brown was talking
[31:47] about people having just wanted to share
[31:51] these with you but you know there's
[31:53] there's three different times I know
[31:55] brother brown talks about somebody
[31:56] having a phobia and you know one time he
[31:59] talks he calls a lady out and he and he
[32:01] tells about her and he said you have a
[32:04] phobia to wintertime he said he said you
[32:08] know you get depressed and you have all
[32:10] these different things happen to you
[32:12] because of the winter and he said you
[32:14] know you get depressed and all of these
[32:15] things and then another time he talks
[32:18] about a man he said he kept saying his
[32:20] mom's face in front of him and you know
[32:22] he said you have this phobia that's
[32:24] causing this you know he calls these
[32:26] people out in different you know and I
[32:28] just want to share that with you because
[32:29] you know it's amazing how them how many
[32:32] different types of phobias that people
[32:33] have and all these different things that
[32:35] happen to people and how people get
[32:37] bound by things that you know they don't
[32:40] even they don't even really they don't
[32:42] even want but you know what they've
[32:44] allowed the devil to have access in to
[32:49] allow these things to happen in their
[32:50] lives but God will has a way for us to
[32:57] to overcome this is from the message
[33:02] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[33:04] and forever and he said when Jesus was
[33:08] here on earth you know he was a manual
[33:10] we all believed that he wasn't just a
[33:13] prophet he was God manifested in flesh
[33:14] and when he was here
[33:16] on earth all the powers that the father
[33:18] had given him everything that was in him
[33:21] he was Emmanuel God in Christ
[33:23] reconciling the world to himself when he
[33:25] met Satan he never used any of his
[33:27] powers he used the word of God
[33:29] he said Satan said if thou be the Son of
[33:32] God I want you to perform a miracle here
[33:34] so I can see you do it see that's still
[33:39] the attitude of Satan let me see you do
[33:41] something make this man to walk and you
[33:44] perform a miracle and turn these stones
[33:46] to bread he said jesus said it is
[33:48] written that man shall not live by bread
[33:50] alone but by every word that cometh out
[33:52] of the mouth of God I see when he when
[33:55] he took him up on the pinnacle of the
[33:57] mountain and he says the angel is
[34:01] written he'd give you you give the
[34:03] angels charge over you lest any time you
[34:05] dash your foot against a stone
[34:06] they said jump up here he said he took
[34:09] him up on the mount and set him set him
[34:12] down he rebuked him again with the word
[34:13] defeated Satan with the Word of God
[34:15] showing that the weakest of Christians
[34:17] can defeat Satan with us say if the Lord
[34:20] it is written it is written he said
[34:23] remember that my friend he says but you
[34:27] just put your faith in the word and
[34:30] believe that it's God's Word and you can
[34:32] beat Satan anywhere anytime
[34:34] if there isn't a preacher in a thousand
[34:37] miles of you you can still whip Satan
[34:39] around on the Word of God so everything
[34:41] that we try to do we must it must come
[34:44] from the word or it's not right to me
[34:46] see it must come this is the
[34:49] foundational truth of God so we need to
[34:54] stay with the word and hold on to what
[34:57] the word has to say because you know
[35:00] Jesus used the word and that's what the
[35:03] believers are supposed to use the same
[35:05] thing is to use that use the word and
[35:09] from the message expectation brother
[35:11] Branham says he said but goes on he said
[35:15] don't talk take a subject on expectation
[35:17] now before you can have expectation
[35:20] there must be faith to accompany that
[35:22] expectation and there's only two
[35:24] elements in the world that controls the
[35:26] world tonight
[35:27] that's fear and faith
[35:30] he he says now now fear has no valuation
[35:34] in it nothing whatsoever it's perfectly
[35:37] endless it hasn't got one good thing
[35:41] about it if I was to be shot in the
[35:44] morning was going to be shot what good
[35:46] would it do to have fear what good would
[35:50] it do me you say well what good would
[35:53] faith do me faith could deliver me but
[35:55] fear can't help me a bit you just get
[35:58] yourself all worked up and more nervous
[36:01] than ever when it comes time for the gun
[36:03] to fire so let's have faith faith could
[36:06] deliver me but if it doesn't what good
[36:08] with fear do me would do anyhow just
[36:11] stay right with faith and hold on to it
[36:13] take God's promise and remain with God
[36:18] because you know he said what good was
[36:21] faith do you well you know what they
[36:24] were three Hebrew boys that got cast
[36:26] into a into a fiery furnace and you know
[36:29] that's what they said they said you know
[36:31] we're not going to bow our gods more
[36:34] than able to deliver us and if he don't
[36:36] we still ain't gonna bail and you know
[36:38] what God was so moved by and he honored
[36:42] their face so much that he come and
[36:43] stood in the midst of them you know that
[36:45] that the king when he looked in he saw
[36:47] four of them he didn't just see the
[36:49] three and so you know if we don't have
[36:50] faith you know God can't operate you
[36:53] know he's the high priest of our
[36:54] confession well if you don't have a
[36:55] confession there's nothing he can all
[36:57] that he can intercede on but you've got
[37:01] to be a Hopf you know for him to be the
[37:03] high priest you've got to have a
[37:04] confession
[37:05] you've got to have a confession of what
[37:06] he said that you believe what he said
[37:16] because you know many times we hear
[37:20] people and you know you know they want
[37:23] to believe you know they say well I wish
[37:28] that was true or you know I wish I could
[37:31] do something well you know the thing is
[37:33] just like he says well you know what
[37:35] would happen if you did you know what
[37:41] would happen if you did you know it's
[37:45] just like somebody that that's bound
[37:47] with with some sort of that one of these
[37:48] phobias and you know the way they treat
[37:50] this is you know they you have to get in
[37:53] your mind that this is this is
[37:56] irrational and that that you know
[37:59] there's no harm in this but you know
[38:03] there's people they have to get they
[38:05] first have to get that in their mind and
[38:06] they made they make that conscious
[38:08] effort and then the second thing is is
[38:11] you actually have to go in a private to
[38:16] show that it's not harmful you know
[38:20] somebody that doesn't you know that
[38:21] that's afraid of the color yellow you
[38:23] know the first thing they have to do is
[38:24] realize you know and say that's not
[38:27] harmful to me there is no harm in that
[38:30] and then you know what they can go out
[38:34] and touch that and then they can move
[38:37] forward you know over time they get to
[38:41] the place where you know they can
[38:42] overcome that and it's the same thing
[38:44] with you and I we have to come to the
[38:46] place that we have to put our faith in
[38:48] the Word of God and say you know what
[38:49] this is what God said because many times
[38:54] people we let that we let the devil say
[38:56] things to us and beat us up and beat us
[38:59] down and then you know we wonder why we
[39:02] can't have victory we can't have Joel we
[39:04] can't have these different things why
[39:05] because we've allowed the devil to beat
[39:07] us up we've a listen to the devil and
[39:13] you know when we say well what can I do
[39:14] about it well the first thing you can do
[39:18] about it is he's first thing you got to
[39:19] do is believe what the word says you've
[39:22] got to have the right mental attitude
[39:23] you've got to have the right mental
[39:26] thought
[39:28] and if you can get the right mental
[39:30] thought if you can think it and not just
[39:34] thinking but then you got to speak it
[39:35] you've got to say what the word says and
[39:40] it and if we can and then if we can
[39:43] believe what the word says and we can
[39:45] say the word then you know what it's not
[39:47] just saying that I'm healed but you know
[39:48] what it's it's to get up and think you
[39:50] know what I'm gonna move on because you
[39:52] know what the devil's not gonna make me
[39:54] this way people sit in there and think
[39:58] well you know what I'm laying in the bed
[40:01] and I'm sick and you know and then we
[40:03] just lay there and say well bye stripes
[40:05] I'm healed we're going to watch then
[40:06] it's time you can say that mean times
[40:08] sometimes it's time to get or put our
[40:09] feet on the floor and get out of the bed
[40:14] you know the thing is is ways you know
[40:17] when the devils beat you down to
[40:19] whatever it is that you're facing that
[40:20] you're fighting when you get up then you
[40:22] you have to you have to think that
[40:25] whatever it is what the word says
[40:29] whatever whatever whatever you have
[40:32] Neeta first you get up and you have to
[40:33] think what the word says then you have
[40:35] to speak the word then you've got to
[40:37] whack down it you've got to move well
[40:43] because if you never act on it then it
[40:45] won't ever come to pass one because when
[40:50] when you think well I think if you have
[40:53] a you have a financial need and you know
[40:56] you you have you don't know how you can
[41:00] pay your bills well you know what they
[41:05] said my God shall supply all my needs
[41:07] according to his riches in glory well
[41:13] the first thing I got to do I got to get
[41:14] it between my ears and then I got to
[41:17] speak it well then the next thing you
[41:19] know I go to work and you know what I
[41:20] have the right mental attitude about
[41:22] going to work and you know what
[41:24] sometimes the thing is you go and earn
[41:26] the first thing you do is say boss you
[41:28] got any extra work for me yeah well you
[41:32] know what sometimes I buy my job they
[41:34] told us I had a boss that said how much
[41:36] overtime can we work he said as long as
[41:38] you're not here twelve hours a day seven
[41:39] days a week he said it's okay
[41:44] but you know the thing is is some people
[41:46] don't want to don't want to do it well
[41:47] you know I punch you in before tea and I
[41:49] won't help well you know sometimes it's
[41:53] when we go to work and you know all of a
[41:55] sudden we get we can work overtime then
[41:57] we can Matt we have the money it's like
[42:00] well I worked my forty hours I'll punch
[42:01] you out then I go home and wait for the
[42:02] Lord to drop it in my lap well sometimes
[42:06] the Lord blesses us with overtime some
[42:09] people don't want to don't see it that
[42:10] way you know it's so it's so amazing
[42:14] that you know you find these kids and
[42:16] they talk about not being able to find a
[42:18] job and well I want to do this and I'm
[42:24] gonna do that I tell them I said can you
[42:25] hold a screwdriver you know I started I
[42:30] start you know I started working in air
[42:32] conditioning you know I didn't I didn't
[42:33] know the first thing about air
[42:34] conditioning but you know I'd already
[42:35] worked I'd already been to school for
[42:37] electronics so I know how to electronics
[42:39] work so when I went in there's a lot of
[42:41] things that when it comes to the
[42:42] electrical part of air conditioning I
[42:45] had that thing knocked that I didn't
[42:46] they started bringing me stuff like I
[42:48] got all this I got all but I just had to
[42:50] learn how refrigeration worked well I
[42:53] went in you know I didn't I didn't know
[42:54] how that thing work but I started work I
[42:56] started learning about it but you know
[42:57] there's kids they can't tell you the
[42:59] first thing about anything and it you
[43:02] know the thing is is there's people in
[43:03] the world that that's made millions of
[43:05] dollars and you know what they've had
[43:06] and they've had an idea and they acted
[43:08] on it you say what I want to do this I
[43:10] want to do that well you know what
[43:11] you're never gonna do that sitting on
[43:12] your rear end warming up you ain't never
[43:15] gonna get you know we're warming a scene
[43:17] ain't never gonna get you anywhere
[43:18] you know there's people out there
[43:19] looking for help all the time you know
[43:21] what if you show up every day and you
[43:23] got a good attitude you can do anything
[43:24] in the world if you're willing to learn
[43:28] there's people out there willing to
[43:29] teach but you know what there's a lot of
[43:34] people that don't don't do that and you
[43:38] know everything that you have and your
[43:40] and your life that whatever you're
[43:42] facing you know the thing is the devil
[43:46] tells you you're not smart enough you're
[43:47] not good enough you don't look good
[43:48] enough whatever you're never gonna
[43:50] measure up or whatever else the devil
[43:51] tells you're gonna watch your right
[43:53] you're never gonna measure up but you
[43:54] know what the thing is
[43:56] we're not looking at his yardstick we're
[43:57] looking through the blood of Jesus
[43:58] Christ and if we look through the blood
[44:00] of Jesus Christ and you know what we're
[44:02] not sure we're not anything that you
[44:04] know one because if we see we're not
[44:07] brother madam said we're not looking at
[44:08] ourselves
[44:09] he said we're looking at him because if
[44:13] we look through the blood see God's not
[44:15] looking at us he's looking at he's
[44:17] looking at the sacrifice he said he's
[44:19] looking at Christ and if Christ was the
[44:21] perfect one then guess what you're
[44:23] perfect through him but the other thing
[44:25] is is are you do you believe that do you
[44:29] believe what God said do you believe
[44:33] what God has said in his word whatever
[44:35] you have need of if you say not if
[44:38] brother Dale says it or somebody else or
[44:40] mama or daddy says it he said but if you
[44:43] say to this mountain the thing is is
[44:48] people you know kids wonder about how
[44:50] old they have to be if you're old enough
[44:51] to think and old enough to speak then
[44:53] you're old enough to put the devil on
[44:55] the run you don't have to be I have to
[44:58] wait till I'm 13 or 14 or I have to have
[45:01] this or that no if you and if you can
[45:04] speak to God God can speak to you but
[45:08] you know there are kids in the world
[45:09] that think you know they have they can't
[45:11] ever measure up you know and they let
[45:12] the devil beat on and you know what they
[45:14] start out at eight nine ten years old
[45:16] and the devil has beat into them until
[45:18] the time that when they get to be
[45:20] teenagers you know what they don't ever
[45:21] think they'll ever measure up and you
[45:25] know the other thing that happens with
[45:26] kids is when kids come along they have
[45:28] parents who have Saudi seeds in their
[45:31] minds that they just continue to grow
[45:32] that you know what they cultivate a
[45:36] thinking of failure and they wonder
[45:39] whether kids fail they wonder why their
[45:41] kids can't make it one because if you
[45:42] don't tell your kids who they are and if
[45:47] you're not praying over your kids and
[45:48] telling them who they are then you know
[45:50] I don't never come to to where they need
[45:52] to be but it's always what we what we
[45:57] put in our kids but the thing is is is
[45:58] is no matter how young you are if you
[46:01] can believe what God says then it can
[46:04] come to pass
[46:11] if we can believe all things are
[46:15] possible
[46:17] he didn't say all things are possible to
[46:23] certain ones he said all things are
[46:28] possible to them that believed you know
[46:34] if it's in our what's in our minds can
[46:39] we believe that do you believe that can
[46:44] you do you walk in that hey mercy can
[46:54] you come up here for a minute would you
[46:55] come up here for a minute
[47:06] you don't have to be afraid I'm not
[47:08] going bearish you don't come here around

[47:27] those people and what you think you see
[47:30] all those people up there now you're
[47:32] afraid about there but you know what I
[47:35] want you to know one thing that
[47:37] everybody in this room loves you and
[47:42] don't you I want you to look at every
[47:43] face in this room and that's the face of
[47:46] love you know if you think you know
[47:52] these people love me and you know what
[47:54] they'd do anything for me
[47:56] then you know what it gets less scary up
[47:58] here than it that you know all these
[48:02] people they love you and do anything in
[48:06] the world for you and you know what they
[48:08] want you to succeed they want you to be
[48:10] the best that you can be and you know
[48:13] what you can be why because God said you
[48:16] could and you know what I have something
[48:20] for you you believe I'll give you
[48:22] something I want to give you something
[48:24] for coming up here tonight if I can find
[48:28] it look at it but you know what when you
[48:31] do something and you know things take
[48:33] place in your lives and I want you to
[48:36] know one son I got a little something
[48:38] for you but I want you to know when I
[48:40] called your name from back there you
[48:42] didn't even realize it
[48:43] but when you got up out of that chair
[48:44] and you said yeah you come up here and
[48:46] find everybody I want you to know this
[48:48] this was already yours and you didn't
[48:50] even know it was yours I won't give that
[48:54] to you what is it
[49:02] that's a $20 bill but you know what you
[49:06] didn't even realize back there that $20
[49:08] long do you did you but you know what
[49:10] when you look at the Word of God when we
[49:14] see it it says I have not seen nor ears
[49:19] have heard neither has it entered into
[49:22] the heart of man what God has installed
[49:24] and you know what just like this right
[49:28] here he said we have to come to him as a
[49:32] child right and if we can come as a
[49:35] child just like mercy come up here she
[49:37] trusted me enough to come up here she
[49:41] didn't know what she was expecting when
[49:42] she came up here but you know what she
[49:44] trusted me and you know what all of us
[49:47] said you were so scared about what was
[49:49] going to take place but you know what I
[49:51] want to tell you one thing you're
[49:53] fearless
[49:54] you know because you had fear but you
[49:56] know what you overcome that fear to come
[49:57] up here it made you fearless and I want
[50:01] you always remember one thing you're
[50:03] fearless no matter what the devil comes
[50:05] at you with you're fearless
[50:07] why because you're one of us you're
[50:09] fearless
[50:10] thank you if we can come the same way
[50:17] tonight yeah I know the rest of you
[50:22] would come us reason I chose mercy
[50:24] because because she'd know what Mercy
[50:29] Mercy she doesn't like being at fear
[50:31] she's she's kind of scared of being up
[50:33] here and that's the reason I come to
[50:36] pick her why because that's something
[50:39] she had to overcome
[50:40] thanks a lot of people in this building
[50:42] boy they just skipped up here they had
[50:45] jumped up here that's not a problem but
[50:48] you know some people they have to
[50:49] overcome something but you know if we
[50:51] come the same way just like she did how
[50:54] many times his brother Dale told us when
[50:56] we got out of our pews to come up for
[50:58] hair for prayer he said it was settled
[51:00] when you walked out of that people
[51:01] brother branham tells the story of the
[51:03] man that come to him and you know he was
[51:07] selling cars and somebody stuck a note
[51:09] in his pocket said where were you spend
[51:11] eternity
[51:13] and he said he went from that point and
[51:17] he started going from church to church
[51:20] and speaking to different one spoke to
[51:22] Billy Graham and different churches and
[51:25] went different places and you know he
[51:27] said it never was settled it never was
[51:29] settled until he come somebody seen him
[51:31] - brother Branham and he said it's
[51:34] already settled he said what do you mean
[51:36] he said the first time you picked that
[51:39] track up and you read that where would
[51:41] you spend eternity and he said you
[51:43] turned and started walking toward God
[51:45] that's where it was settled and brothers
[51:49] and sisters that's how simple it is and
[51:51] young people that's how simple it is you
[51:55] think the devil wants to make things
[51:57] complicated in your life but you know
[51:58] that's how that's how simple God is if
[52:01] we complete you know people say I want
[52:04] to receive the Holy Ghost well you know
[52:06] what the bow brother Branham says that
[52:08] he said he wants to give it to you more
[52:10] than you want it for yourself if you can
[52:15] believe that whatever you're looking for
[52:16] whatever you have need of whatever it is
[52:21] that you're facing and you know the
[52:25] thing is is we you have a whole church
[52:26] family and many and you know I want all
[52:31] the young people to know that you have a
[52:33] family and it's not it's not who you're
[52:36] sitting on the pew with that is your
[52:39] family all most I guess most of you have
[52:41] the same last name you know makes your
[52:45] mom and dad and everything but I want
[52:46] you know this is your church family and
[52:51] you know the thing is is we all want you
[52:53] to succeed and succeed ain't having
[52:56] money and and it's good to make great
[53:00] grades but you know that ain't that
[53:03] ain't all that there is in the world but
[53:07] don't don't think that brother Aaron
[53:09] says I can be a slacker because I'm not
[53:12] we're not we're not we're not letting
[53:14] anybody be underwater in here if you
[53:17] don't you know what that means it means
[53:18] you're under sea level you know we don't
[53:22] have nobody I can't get a boat do the
[53:26] best you can
[53:27] but let me tell you something I want you
[53:29] to be all that you can be in Jesus
[53:31] Christ be all you can be in God's army
[53:40] being the army of God let's be all that
[53:42] we can be let's do all that we can do we
[53:49] can lo we can allow fear to hold us but
[53:55] you know what God doesn't want us to
[53:57] live like that this is from the message
[54:01] possessing the gates of the enemy I just
[54:03] want to read a couple of quotes here and
[54:05] then I'm gonna dis me the most stop
[54:09] hiraman this is from the message the
[54:12] possessing the gates of the enemy after
[54:15] trial mister from 1964 it's no what you
[54:19] I want you to listen to this he said I
[54:24] wish I had more time to get to more
[54:25] heroes but I got about ten minutes now
[54:28] look at these precious heroes as they
[54:30] were and great worries of faith they all
[54:32] died at the gate of death they all
[54:34] perished right at the gate of death he
[54:40] said then come along the royal seed of
[54:42] Abraham they were all the natural seed
[54:44] of Abraham from Isaac but here come the
[54:46] royal seed of Abraham which was Christ
[54:48] Abraham's seed of faith what we're
[54:52] supposed to be just see how whether we
[54:54] are or not the natural seed only was a
[54:57] type all others was born of natural
[55:00] birth but he come a virgin birth see
[55:04] that wasn't of the seed of Abraham then
[55:07] a Jewett come by the seat of faith of
[55:08] the promise and then we're supposed to
[55:10] be his children through this man I said
[55:13] watch what he did when he was on earth
[55:17] he conquered it possessed every gate the
[55:19] enemy had the royal seat he promised it
[55:21] by the word he conquered it he conquered
[55:23] the gate of sickness for us that's what
[55:25] he come to do he remember sick people
[55:29] he conquered that gate you don't have to
[55:31] conquer it he conquered it
[55:33] the other men had to conquer their own
[55:35] gate but you don't have to conquer it's
[55:37] already conquered he conquered the gates
[55:39] of sickness
[55:40] and what did he do when he conquered the
[55:43] gates of sickness saying that he would
[55:45] whatsoever you ask on earth whatever you
[55:47] bind on earth he would mind it in heaven
[55:49] give us the keys to the gate he
[55:51] conquered the gate of temptation by the
[55:53] word and the keys was resist the enemy
[55:56] and he'll flee from you he conquered it
[55:58] all conquered every sickness he
[56:01] conquered death and he conquered hell
[56:03] and he conquered death and hell he
[56:05] conquered what the others couldn't
[56:06] conquer because there of the natural
[56:08] seed this is the spiritual seed he
[56:10] conquered the great the gate of the
[56:13] grave and rose up on the third day for
[56:15] our justification and now we're more
[56:17] than conquerors we're just to walk right
[56:20] into it as an inheritance more than
[56:22] conquerors I see lost my place now we
[56:32] are dealing with a defeated enemy
[56:34] sicknesses defeated death is defeated
[56:36] hell is defeated everything is defeated
[56:40] oh my wish I was twice my size now maybe
[56:43] I feel twice as good we are disputing
[56:47] with a conquered enemy if you can
[56:54] believe that that you are you are I mean
[56:57] it's he's conquered he's already
[56:59] defeated and you're disputing with
[57:01] somebody that that doesn't even have
[57:03] keys to his own house that's already
[57:05] defeated and he wants to argue with you
[57:08] over what's taking place but he's
[57:11] already been defeated but here come the
[57:14] royal seat of Abraham which was Christ
[57:16] Abraham's seed of faith what we're
[57:18] supposed to be whether we are or not the
[57:22] natural seed was only a type all others
[57:24] were born of natural birth but he come
[57:26] the virgin birth see that wasn't the
[57:29] seed of Abraham than a Jew I think we're
[57:32] reading the same thing I just passed
[57:34] over that anyway he goes and 2,000 years
[57:36] later
[57:37] skip down read the wrong in the wrong
[57:39] spot anyway here he comes among us this
[57:42] afternoon identifying himself the mighty
[57:44] Conqueror amen he is still here alive
[57:47] indicating his promise royal seed of
[57:49] Abraham and then we go to the neck
[57:54] when is god's covenant with Abraham and
[57:56] his seed Jesus never did say did you
[58:00] feel it he said did you believe it a man
[58:03] based solely upon the finished works of
[58:05] Christ of Calvary every redemptive
[58:08] blessing belongs to the believer when
[58:10] you become a Christian God gives you a
[58:12] checkbook in there with God's name
[58:14] signed at the bottom of it for every for
[58:17] anything you got need of while we're in
[58:21] life's journey are you afraid to cash it
[58:24] amen fill it out and send it to the
[58:25] headquarters and see what God will do
[58:27] about it amen
[58:29] he says well if I know there was
[58:32] deposited enough his blood is sufficient
[58:35] for what he was wounded for our
[58:36] transgressions bruised for our
[58:38] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[58:40] was upon him with His stripes we were
[58:41] healed it's already deposited at Calvary
[58:44] and sickness is an attribute of sin and
[58:47] when we when you touch sin you've got to
[58:49] touch sickness amen and he says the same
[58:52] word this speaks of saved as both
[58:55] translated both ways and he continues on
[58:59] down and that so he skips a little bit
[59:03] and we go down to the last last one this
[59:05] and you can read this later but Jesus
[59:09] contantly constantly fear not fear not I
[59:11] am he that was dead in life forevermore
[59:13] fear not fear not I am with thee always
[59:17] back to the end of the world fear not
[59:18] and the Christian keeps sitting back
[59:20] saying oh I just wonder oh my turn loose
[59:24] amen
[59:25] get all get all the things away from you
[59:29] say mister Satan you are defeated Jesus
[59:31] Christ stripped you of every power you
[59:35] had when when he died at Calvary and
[59:38] you're nothing but a bluff and you can't
[59:40] Bluff me amen
[59:42] I'm made of stuff that don't Bluff
[59:44] that's that's come from Calvary
[59:48] hallelujah don't Bluff it go receive it
[59:52] and I believe that this even so let's
[59:56] all stand this evening
[1:00:00] that's what I want y'all to know tonight
[1:00:02] young people I want y'all to say that
[1:00:04] over and over and over let's all say
[1:00:11] that together
[1:00:11] I'm the stuff that don't Bluff say that
[1:00:16] I'm the stuff they don't Bluff
[1:00:19] I'm the stuff that don't Bluff you're
[1:00:27] disputing with a conquered enemy he come
[1:00:32] to Bluff II you know why you know what
[1:00:34] because if he could actually do
[1:00:35] something he wouldn't be a bluff you
[1:00:39] know a bluff is somebody that can do
[1:00:40] anything you know there's a song that
[1:00:45] says nothing can touch me that doesn't
[1:00:48] pass through his hands it doesn't matter
[1:00:52] what you know what we face trials we
[1:00:55] face problems and heartaches and
[1:00:56] everything like it but you know what
[1:00:57] God's the one that knows it comes our
[1:00:59] way
[1:00:59] there's nothing that comes that befall
[1:01:02] you that takes God by surprise and you
[1:01:09] know what we can glory in our problems
[1:01:13] if we know how to do that brother
[1:01:18] Branham said that you know we can we can
[1:01:21] go the right way you know we can conquer
[1:01:23] and do the things if we're pointed in
[1:01:25] the right direction you know the thing
[1:01:28] is that we got to get our mind in the
[1:01:29] right direction and then we can overcome
[1:01:33] so when we say we're going to glory in
[1:01:36] our infirmities well you know what we're
[1:01:37] not going glory and just sit around and
[1:01:39] say well I'm doing this for the honor
[1:01:40] and glory of the Lord no we're going to
[1:01:42] do it because you know what something's
[1:01:43] come our way and God's made us more than
[1:01:46] conquerors to overcome it you know life
[1:01:49] life has brought things in each one of
[1:01:52] our lives that we don't want and we
[1:01:53] don't like but you know what God put
[1:01:55] them in our lives for our perfection we
[1:01:58] inherited things that we have to deal
[1:02:00] with and you know what
[1:02:01] God give them to us to make us who we
[1:02:03] are and you know we can we can overcome
[1:02:08] them or we can make mountains out of
[1:02:10] mole hills and some people that's
[1:02:13] you know that's the way they do they sit
[1:02:15] behind something and so well you know if
[1:02:17] I didn't have this problem if I didn't
[1:02:18] have that problem I wouldn't I wouldn't
[1:02:20] be able to do this I wouldn't be able to
[1:02:21] do that
[1:02:22] you know if if we sit down and we start
[1:02:24] to look in our lives and we see the
[1:02:26] things that happen you know there's
[1:02:27] people that's got them a lot worse than
[1:02:29] we do you know there's though a little
[1:02:33] story about the man says you know it's
[1:02:34] complaining about not having any shoes
[1:02:36] till he met the man didn't have any feet
[1:02:40] and we we see all the things that that
[1:02:42] come our way that that happens to us but
