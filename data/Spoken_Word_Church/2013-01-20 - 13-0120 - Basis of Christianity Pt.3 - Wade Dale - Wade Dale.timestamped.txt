[0:00] let's turn to the Book of
[0:02] Proverbs now what you got in front of
[0:04] you is those quotes that I told yall
[0:06] would get together and then for those of
[0:08] you that were not here Wednesday night
[0:11] there is um that's pretty much the
[0:14] quotes that we read Wednesday night plus
[0:16] something so that's
[0:19] uh if you didn't listen to Wednesday
[0:22] night service you ought to just because
[0:24] I did
[0:27] it but but
[0:33] you didn't
[0:42] list Proverbs well if I get you the
[0:44] Proverbs it'll help
[0:49] six
[0:55] 16 do everybody know what um we not
[0:59] we'll wait for just a minute but
[1:00] everybody knows what brother Brown said
[1:01] about if you're
[1:03] stingy do
[1:05] what have the attitude to start giving
[1:07] stuff away if you're if you're this have
[1:11] the attitude of the opposite right just
[1:14] kind of keep that in you in the back of
[1:16] your
[1:17] mind as we go through all
[1:27] this verse 16
[1:35] these six things does the Lord
[1:37] hate now if the Lord hates them then
[1:39] anything below that should hate them
[1:42] right if the Lord hates them that's the
[1:44] Apex he if he hates them then everything
[1:47] below that there's nowhere down the line
[1:49] that God's going to begin to start
[1:50] liking these
[1:52] things is that good
[1:54] enough are these things in the order of
[1:57] hatred not
[2:01] I don't see that in the book of they
[2:04] just put all six of them in a in a in a
[2:05] person and they're wrong so I got to
[2:09] turn this on hold on but why does he say
[2:11] seven are an Abomination
[2:15] six Proverbs
[2:20] 616 seven are an Abomination unto him we
[2:23] we'll get we'll cover all
[2:25] that cuz you got to read one 2 3
[2:30] 4
[2:32] 5 6 and the last one and he that Seth
[2:35] Discord among Brethren and that kind of
[2:38] takes everything into account of the all
[2:40] six of them cuz these six things does
[2:43] the Lord hate cuz look he doesn't hate
[2:46] it that you don't get
[2:48] Revelation watch these things these are
[2:50] not all let let's let's be careful and
[2:54] not spiritualize this too
[2:56] much leave it natural cuz that's what he
[2:59] he's talking about the Lord hates these
[3:02] things in a person right a proud
[3:07] look a lying
[3:10] tongue hands that shed innocent
[3:13] blood a heart that devises Wicked
[3:19] imaginations feet that be Swift and
[3:21] running to
[3:24] Mischief a false witness that speaketh
[3:28] lies and he that Seth
[3:31] Discord among
[3:33] Brethren
[3:35] now yeah you can spiritualize all that
[3:39] but if that naturally happens in your in
[3:43] your U total being all right the total
[3:47] being of you then you got a
[3:50] problem okay sure we were born Liars
[3:53] sure we we probably shed innocent blood
[3:56] and didn't know it by saying something
[3:58] to hurt somebody that's spiritual let's
[4:01] just keep this natural cuz this is six
[4:03] things that God hates and then when you
[4:06] get to that seventh one because look a
[4:08] proud look that's something you
[4:11] do a lying tongue that's something you
[4:14] do it's not that doesn't say your a
[4:16] Brother's lying tongue that says you're
[4:18] lying tongue all right it doesn't say
[4:21] the other guy's hands that shed innocent
[4:23] blood no it's talking about you a heart
[4:24] that devises Wicked
[4:26] imaginations all right feet that be
[4:28] Swift in right to
[4:30] Mischief other words Busy Bodies you
[4:33] know a false witness that speaketh
[4:37] lies and then the last one is he that
[4:39] sth Discord among Brethren now you're
[4:42] stepping out and he's showing you that
[4:45] what these things
[4:47] are has an effect on your brethren or
[4:52] sisters everybody see that and he that
[4:54] sth Discord among Brethren so he's going
[4:57] out to everybody else then and it's like
[5:01] what we were talking about Wednesday
[5:02] night it's that witness it's the witness
[5:06] that you are to this world because the
[5:08] only God they're going to see is
[5:11] you and and the way we act and react and
[5:14] our reactions proves we are because now
[5:17] read at verse
[5:20] 22 let's read
[5:23] 20 cuz God doesn't leave us hanging cuz
[5:25] every one of us are guilty of this
[5:27] pretty much except for maybe hands that
[5:28] shed inocent blood I hope we that
[5:30] nobody's ever murdered anybody
[5:32] here but we have done these things in
[5:35] our life but we should be that God has
[5:38] taken these things away or has already
[5:41] taken these things away all right my son
[5:44] keep thy father's commandment and
[5:46] forsake not the law of thy mother bind
[5:49] them
[5:49] continually upon thine heart and tie
[5:52] them about thy
[5:54] neck when thou
[5:56] goest it shall lead thee
[6:01] what the father's commandment and the
[6:04] law of the mother all
[6:07] right when thou goest it shall lead thee
[6:11] when thou
[6:12] sleepest it shall keep
[6:15] thee and when thou a
[6:17] wakest it shall talk with thee now what
[6:21] is that
[6:23] it that it's the holy
[6:25] spirit that it is the holy spirit for
[6:28] the Commandment is a lamp and the law is
[6:31] a light and reproofs of
[6:34] instruction instruction are the way of
[6:38] life all
[6:41] right you can keep reading on down a
[6:43] little bit
[6:45] further and see how that it
[6:48] affects your life but let's go
[6:51] to one
[6:54] more let's go over to chapter 7 just
[6:56] look over well you don't have scull
[6:58] field Bible you may have Change chapter
[7:01] 7 verse
[7:07] 1 my son keep my words and lay up my
[7:10] Commandments with thee keep my
[7:13] Commandments and live and my law as the
[7:16] apple of thine eye bind them upon thy
[7:21] fingers write them upon the
[7:24] table of thine
[7:27] heart he's telling you to do that
[7:31] okay see there's things that we have to
[7:34] do and I I see more and
[7:37] more
[7:40] that as
[7:42] people I'm trying to choose my words
[7:45] correctly here as people of the message
[7:48] of the hour we
[7:50] have went away from all this and we've
[7:54] come over to
[7:56] where it's like I was saying Wednesday
[7:58] night and for those of you that weren't
[7:59] here or listen I'm going to say it
[8:03] again I don't want this message to be I
[8:07] know something that you don't
[8:08] know I know more than you know you
[8:12] should hear me because I know more than
[8:15] you do no that's a condescending
[8:18] attitude and I do not I'm like God I
[8:20] don't like the condescending attitude
[8:22] because that's what number one is if
[8:24] you'll look up a proud look if you don't
[8:27] know what a condescending attitude is
[8:29] it's an attitude that you're up here and
[8:30] they're down
[8:33] here cuz I want to read you something
[8:36] right here this knock your socks
[8:40] off chapter
[8:46] 17 verse
[8:51] 5 don't you see how strong this
[8:55] is whosoever who so who so mock the poor
[9:01] reproaches his maker
[9:05] 175 Proverbs
[9:08] 175 man I hadn't been through Proverbs
[9:10] in a long time and I've started I'm
[9:12] almost in the last chapter of
[9:14] proverbs got a lot of good things about
[9:17] life how to live life how to do business
[9:21] how to treat your
[9:22] wife cuz it says here in one of these
[9:25] places that it's better that you live in
[9:27] a corner than to live with a brawling
[9:28] woman in a big
[9:32] house praise the Lord
[9:35] anyhow chapter 17 verse3 the fining pot
[9:39] is for silver and the furnace for gold
[9:42] but the Lord trith the
[9:44] hearts so what's he a w a wicked doer
[9:47] giveth heed to false lips and a liar
[9:51] giveth ear to a naughty tongue who so
[9:54] mock the
[9:55] poor now you can say whatever you want
[9:58] to say
[9:59] make that poor in spirit make that poor
[10:01] in money make that poor
[10:03] in put whatever you
[10:06] want it's not that it's just saying
[10:08] people that don't have
[10:10] money but even the poor in spirit but
[10:12] look what it says though look how it
[10:14] ties in whosoever mock the poor
[10:16] reproaches his
[10:19] maker and that's a capital
[10:22] M right that's God
[10:26] right you know and and sometimes in our
[10:29] culture and our our way of doing things
[10:31] I told you this may be boring to you but
[10:34] if we don't live it then you can forget
[10:35] about all these other things right
[10:38] right but if we condescend on the poor
[10:41] or if we think the poor man there's just
[10:43] all kind of things about and I know poor
[10:45] is a state of
[10:48] mind sometimes poor is a state of mind
[10:51] and there's going to be always poor
[10:52] people but God it looks like God's
[10:54] taking care of the poor
[10:55] people all right so we shouldn't mock
[10:58] poor people
[10:59] whosoever whoo mock the poor reproacheth
[11:02] his maker and he that is glad at
[11:05] calamities shall not be
[11:09] unpunished you know what calamity is
[11:13] confusion he that is glad in confusion
[11:16] shall not be unpunished in other words
[11:18] somewhere down the road God is going to
[11:21] punish the people that cause
[11:24] confusion all right look at verse
[11:27] chapter 19
[11:30] just picked out a few this morning then
[11:32] we're going to read a few quotes chapter
[11:34] 19 chapter
[11:35] 19 in
[11:38] Proverbs Proverbs Chapter 19 better is
[11:41] the poor that walketh in his
[11:44] Integrity than he that is perverse in
[11:46] his lips and is a
[11:50] fool also that the soul be without
[11:53] knowledge it is not good and he that
[11:56] hasteth with his feet
[11:57] sinth the foolishness of man perverteth
[12:01] his
[12:02] ways and his heart frth against the
[12:07] Lord look at verse eight though he that
[12:10] GTH
[12:11] wisdom loveth his own
[12:14] soul and he that keepeth understanding
[12:16] shall find good a false witness shall
[12:20] not be
[12:22] unpunished and he that speaketh
[12:25] lies Shall
[12:27] Perish
[12:29] pretty tough
[12:31] huh verse
[12:36] 16 he that keepeth the Commandment
[12:39] keepeth his own soul but he that
[12:41] despises his ways shall
[12:43] die he that has pity upon the
[12:46] poor lendeth unto the
[12:49] Lord It's like God takes care of poor
[12:51] people
[12:53] huh somebody somebody has to I mean
[12:55] somebody has to and and and that which
[12:59] he hath
[13:02] given and that which he hath given he
[13:04] will pay him
[13:07] again if you have pity upon the poor and
[13:10] you lendeth to the poor now that don't
[13:12] mean cuz it tells you here not to lend
[13:14] money to a brother and charge him
[13:16] interest okay we'll get into that later
[13:18] but just like we're doing this food bank
[13:20] and stuff like that and we're you know
[13:21] doing things to try to help people if
[13:23] you need help somewhere along the line
[13:25] we may need help you know
[13:29] but he that he that hath pity upon the
[13:31] poor lendeth unto the Lord not the
[13:34] person so the Lord is going to take that
[13:37] which he has
[13:39] given and pay him back twice it says
[13:42] again right so that's what he's saying
[13:45] if you know you lend yourself doesn't
[13:47] matter if you lend yourself to to you
[13:50] know like brother Joe does to the
[13:52] nursing home to me that's lending to the
[13:55] poor people they're they're they're not
[13:57] maybe they may have millions of dollars
[13:58] but look at the condition they're
[13:59] sitting in their their their families
[14:02] deserted them maybe their kids never
[14:04] come and see them that's a poor state
[14:07] right though they may be millionaires
[14:09] and have hundreds of thousands of
[14:10] dollars in the bank it does no good
[14:13] that's why that that when brother Joe
[14:17] goes and you that go help you're lending
[14:20] to the poor so the Lord's going to take
[14:21] whatever time that you
[14:23] spent or money or whatever you spent and
[14:26] he's going to give it back to you again
[14:27] not just the part you spent he's going
[14:29] to give it back to you again they
[14:30] promised he do that all right so that's
[14:32] what
[14:33] we that's why I said this is going to be
[14:35] the basis of Christianity the basis of
[14:37] Christianity is what
[14:39] giving God did that for J God did that
[14:42] for
[14:44] us he gave his only begotten son we read
[14:46] it last Sunday he
[14:48] gave right all right so let's keep
[14:52] reading right here he that ha pity upon
[14:53] the poor lendeth unto the Lord and that
[14:56] which he hath given will he pay again
[14:59] then it talks about chasten thy son
[15:01] while there is hope and let not thy Soul
[15:03] spare for his
[15:05] crying look at verse
[15:08] 20 hear counsel and receive
[15:12] instruction that thou mayest be wise in
[15:15] thy latter end
[15:17] right that talks about you and I right
[15:21] in our latter in receiving instruction
[15:24] and that's what we're doing now I I
[15:26] think we've come to the place to where
[15:29] that that we're way up in the pyramid
[15:31] and we don't need instruction we we got
[15:34] all this thing figured out well I don't
[15:36] think our pastor feels that way I don't
[15:39] think I feel that way we need to learn
[15:42] and learn from each other learn from our
[15:46] mistakes yes but look at verse 23 well
[15:50] let's do
[15:51] 22 the desire of a man is his
[15:55] kindness and a poor man is better than a
[15:58] liar
[16:00] a poor man is better than a liar all
[16:03] right the fear of the Lord tendeth to
[16:07] life and he that hath it shall abide
[16:13] satisfied he shall not be
[16:17] visited with
[16:19] evil what
[16:21] promise I underline that one in my Bible
[16:24] I want to go back to that one the fear
[16:26] of the Lord lendeth tend
[16:29] to in other words to your life all
[16:32] right and he that hath it shall abide
[16:36] satisfied he shall not be
[16:40] visited with
[16:42] evil look at verse 28 now let's go to
[16:45] the other side an ungodly witness
[16:49] scornest
[16:51] judgment and the mouth of the
[16:53] wicked devour
[16:57] iniquity h
[17:00] now let's go chapter 20 I'm just going
[17:02] to read a few here and then we'll then
[17:04] we'll make a few more
[17:09] comments verse
[17:13] seven the just man walketh in his
[17:16] integrity that's what I was talking
[17:18] about Wednesday night if we can't walk
[17:20] through
[17:23] life and somebody say there goes at
[17:26] least if they understand you or not
[17:28] there goes someone different there's
[17:31] something different about that person
[17:35] right okay there's something different
[17:38] now you can say there's something
[17:39] different than being in a bad way but
[17:42] there's something different because
[17:45] remember the just man walketh in his
[17:48] Integrity his children are blessed after
[17:54] him see that promise the children are
[17:57] blessed at after
[18:00] him
[18:03] okay let's read this one right here and
[18:05] then we'll stop and make a few comments
[18:07] chapter
[18:12] 22 cuz you know I don't want people
[18:17] to I want you to realize something we
[18:20] are what we are by the grace of
[18:22] God but he gives you five senses to
[18:25] contact this world like brother Brady
[18:27] always told me mean and he said he
[18:29] expects you to use them right all
[18:34] right God can't make you walk
[18:40] Godly he
[18:41] can't he can't make you walk
[18:45] Godly but if you'll get God inside like
[18:48] I said Wednesday night and let him walk
[18:50] then you'll have to walk Godly there's
[18:53] no gray area in there all right sure you
[18:55] got a gray area because of this thing
[18:56] right here there's things we're going to
[18:58] get we're going to get trapped into and
[19:01] and you know we're going to
[19:02] fall but are we going to stay falling no
[19:06] we're going to get up and start over
[19:09] again you know why cuz we know how to do
[19:11] it that's right the world doesn't know
[19:13] how to get up from an adversity and go
[19:15] again that's what I'm uh trying to to
[19:18] get people to understand and I'm talking
[19:20] to you to understand is
[19:24] that what we
[19:26] project this world is looking for
[19:30] God this whole world I don't care if
[19:32] it's a sinner I don't care if it's
[19:33] somebody that's that's uh drunk or or
[19:37] prostitute or they're looking for
[19:41] something to raise them out of what
[19:43] they're in
[19:46] right Romans 8 the whole world groaneth
[19:49] and travail us waiting for the
[19:51] manifestation of God in a group of
[19:53] people now I didn't change the Bible
[19:55] that's exactly what it says it says the
[19:57] manifestation of the sons of God God
[19:58] same thing okay it's waiting on the
[20:01] whole world right so the whole world
[20:04] whether you be in job whether you be in
[20:06] your acquaintances even your
[20:08] family that are not serving the lord
[20:10] even they want they are longing for
[20:13] somebody to be right cuz they see so
[20:17] much wrong they see so much of this that
[20:18] we're talking about they see so much of
[20:20] this backbiting and lying and filing
[20:22] this out in the world they're looking
[20:24] and longing for
[20:26] somebody that's why man when you walk in
[20:28] a
[20:29] room people you'll watch after a little
[20:32] while they'll just start congregating
[20:34] toward
[20:35] you cuz they want to be right they want
[20:38] to know how to do right nobody's told
[20:40] them how to do right I mean you go to a
[20:42] church and they tell you how to feel
[20:44] good and all that stuff in the
[20:45] denominational churches but we have life
[20:49] and we have life inside supposed to
[20:51] inside of us that radiates out because
[20:54] somewhere down the line if it doesn't if
[20:56] you don't have life inside of of you the
[20:58] life of God you're not going to act like
[21:02] him just simple really simple this is
[21:05] just simple Christianity without saying
[21:08] brother brandham said all right and if
[21:11] we don't live that then you can forget
[21:12] what he said that's right CU that's what
[21:14] he preached he preached Christianity all
[21:16] right but he preached it at his highest
[21:18] Apex so we should be at that Apex of
[21:21] height with him all right and that's
[21:23] what we're heading toward cuz I know
[21:26] it's there so somebody can make it all
[21:27] right
[21:28] look at chapter
[21:31] 22 a good name a good
[21:36] name is rather to be chosen than great
[21:41] riches and loving
[21:45] favor rather than silver and gold now
[21:48] let's look at the context of this though
[21:50] who's writing
[21:51] this who wrote the Book of Proverbs
[21:55] Solomon the richest
[21:59] wisest man in the world and he said you
[22:02] can take all my silver billions of
[22:05] dollars all my gold billions of dollars
[22:08] and you can throw it away if I don't
[22:10] have loving
[22:13] favor or you can take all my
[22:16] riches and if I'm if my name doesn't
[22:20] match what I'm supposed to be which was
[22:23] King if and and the wisest man in the
[22:26] world the Bible said I just got through
[22:28] Reading there in Kings myself
[22:30] transposing the Bible over to this new
[22:32] one or the new one at
[22:35] work Solomon wanted to be wise he wanted
[22:39] to lead his people so God said I'll not
[22:41] only let you be wise he said I'll even
[22:42] give you riches to go along with it
[22:44] because you asked that he said you
[22:46] didn't ask wisdom for yourself cuz he
[22:48] could have he he could have asked wisdom
[22:50] to be rich yourself but he didn't want
[22:52] to he wanted Israel remember brother
[22:54] Brown said that was their
[22:55] Millennium that was their years of rain
[22:58] that no war they prospered they built
[23:02] cities they built houses the coffers
[23:05] were full of gold but here a man looks
[23:08] down and he writes one day and he says a
[23:10] good
[23:13] name is rather to be
[23:16] chosen than all of the riches of my
[23:21] kingdom if he lied he lied but this was
[23:24] the Lord writing through him so this was
[23:27] what was imposed on him to write through
[23:30] the
[23:31] Lord for us a good
[23:35] name okay a good name is rather to be
[23:38] chosen than great riches and loving
[23:41] favor rather than silver and
[23:45] gold the rich and poor meet
[23:50] together the Lord is the
[23:52] maker of them
[23:55] all a prudent man
[23:58] forseeth the evil and hideth
[24:02] himself but the simple pass on and are
[24:07] punished by humility listen to this
[24:10] here's two
[24:11] things has nothing to do with money has
[24:14] nothing to do with status has nothing to
[24:16] do with anything but something that you
[24:18] can do yourself by humility and the fear
[24:22] of the Lord are riches and honor in life
[24:25] pretty simple but very
[24:26] profound
[24:30] Ray Croc said one time he said if you go
[24:33] into business to make money you'll fail
[24:37] if you go in business to make someone
[24:39] else Prosper you'll always prosper and
[24:42] that's the way we should look at life
[24:44] same thing we do with with here but see
[24:48] watch how it goes through there and and
[24:51] comes down from verse one now watch
[24:53] verse 5 thorns and snares are in the way
[24:55] of the forward forward he that doth keep
[24:59] his soul shall be far from
[25:01] them in other words sh the appearance of
[25:03] evil that's scripture train up a child
[25:06] see how it goes into it train up a child
[25:07] and way it should go and when he is old
[25:11] he will not depart from
[25:13] it the rich ruleth over the poor and
[25:16] this is one of Dave's favorite
[25:18] scriptures the rich ruleth over the poor
[25:20] and the borrower is
[25:22] servant to the limb lender he that sth
[25:26] iniquity shall reap vanity and the rod
[25:29] of his anger shall
[25:31] fail pretty tough isn't
[25:35] it look at verse
[25:39] 16 we'll end it right there with this
[25:41] one just make a few comments he that
[25:43] oppresseth the poor to increase his
[25:47] riches now you can talk natural and
[25:49] spiritual here if you want to he that
[25:51] oppresseth the poor to increase his
[25:54] riches and he that giveth to the rich
[25:56] shall surely
[25:59] come to
[26:01] want so we see that in our in our own
[26:04] personal life that's why I said it's
[26:07] it's much important that your
[26:10] name be good I saying Wednesday night
[26:13] what kind of a reproach are you if you
[26:16] go out and do things wrong in life and
[26:19] then you come to church
[26:22] here is that the way that this church
[26:25] teaches it are we are
[26:29] we supposed to accept
[26:32] that or are we supposed to say something
[26:35] about
[26:38] it we're supposed to help you become
[26:43] wiser right now not not the wisdom of
[26:47] the
[26:48] world but Godly wisdom to live a life to
[26:52] get up in the morning and not hang your
[26:55] head low and and be defeated right okay
[26:59] not not be not be something that you're
[27:02] ashamed of if you're ashamed then you're
[27:04] not a
[27:06] Christian you know you I'm not ashamed
[27:08] of where I walk cuz I know God's changed
[27:12] I I can see myself changed I know others
[27:14] have seen you know change from back when
[27:16] I used to be but if but if we haven't
[27:18] had a change in our life then the change
[27:20] hasn't
[27:22] begun can I say that one more time yes
[27:25] if we haven't had a change in our life
[27:28] your change will not come right right if
[27:31] you had had a change already you forget
[27:33] about change over here cuz see the
[27:36] change started at the new birth that's
[27:38] right cuz you become a changed person
[27:40] that's right a changed individual that's
[27:43] right and then that's going to culminate
[27:45] that's going to culminate in a Rapture
[27:48] that's the culmination of when you
[27:50] started on your journey to not
[27:54] just not just um what what did Jesus say
[27:58] he said you you you you you clean the
[28:01] The Seer in other words you clean the
[28:03] Seer that that that the prophets are in
[28:06] but you're the ones that put them in the
[28:07] in the ground that's pretty
[28:09] strong in other words he said oh this is
[28:12] where Abraham is buried we're going to
[28:14] keep it all clean and shiny but your
[28:18] actions and your ways is the ones that
[28:20] put that prophet in the ground that's
[28:22] what he was telling them right your
[28:23] Doctrine and your ways of doing things
[28:25] is the one that put them in the ground
[28:28] same way with brother Dale if we act and
[28:30] we act up and we do things out in the
[28:32] world and and it becomes a reflection on
[28:35] him he's the he's the man he's the
[28:39] leader he's the one that puts his life
[28:42] on the line all the time for
[28:44] you now it's time for us to reap the
[28:46] benefits of that and turn around and do
[28:47] the same
[28:49] thing live the
[28:51] life live the life let's let's don't be
[28:53] a reproach to the world that's right
[28:55] let's don't be let's don't be something
[28:57] that we're not when I said Wednesday
[29:00] night I'm like brother Dale I wish that
[29:01] we could all see that we were
[29:04] lost just lost as lost can be and start
[29:08] somewhere and say God I'm
[29:11] lost I'm not doing I'm not changed yet
[29:15] change
[29:16] me what's that
[29:18] song change my heart on God and then
[29:21] what is it's what something something
[29:22] he's changing me from glory to glory
[29:25] he's changing me from glor from Sun to
[29:28] Sunday I don't think you realize and I'm
[29:31] talking about you when I say me that
[29:34] when you walk out of this service today
[29:36] you're going to be better or
[29:40] worse you're going to be better or worse
[29:42] and then it's going to Heap on you the
[29:43] next time you
[29:45] go and it's going to make you
[29:48] worse Better or Worse that's what the
[29:50] prophet said and I can understand that
[29:51] because if we bring a sin in or we bring
[29:53] something in that we know we should get
[29:55] out of our life or do away with with him
[29:57] and then we going to get rid of it and
[29:59] bring it back the next Sunday it just
[30:00] gets
[30:01] bigger you know God even said that he
[30:03] would give you a strong delusion to
[30:05] believe a
[30:08] lie and I'm not going to quote the rest
[30:10] of it because you know what it
[30:12] says it's not good all right let's look
[30:15] at these not the one living me a sermon
[30:17] but let's I think it's got a few of the
[30:19] same quotes in it but just go to the one
[30:21] where it says
[30:23] adoption just read just a few excuse me
[30:31] and I read some of these Wednesday just
[30:33] forgive me if you were here but some of
[30:35] you
[30:37] weren't let's read it
[30:40] here now this is the adoption Series
[30:42] this is where brother random is trying
[30:43] to get people to see that there's more
[30:45] to the New Birth than just being born
[30:48] again right there's more to the New
[30:50] Birth than just being born again there's
[30:52] a walk all right uh the prodal son he
[30:56] acted up but he was a son yes but see to
[31:00] show that he was a son he came back his
[31:02] dad didn't go get him he came back
[31:04] that's what God wants you to do he wants
[31:05] you to come back all right cuz we all
[31:08] backslide every day he wants you to come
[31:09] back brother said the Holy Ghost to go
[31:11] out on the limb and sit there and wait
[31:12] on you to call him back what he's a
[31:14] gentleman you grieve him something you
[31:16] do he goes out there you know what he's
[31:17] going to sit there but you call him back
[31:20] it's not that you lost your salvation
[31:21] you just lost the joy of him being close
[31:23] that's right
[31:25] okay there's where the church is failing
[31:28] this is adoption
[31:29] 1960 on that walk this is where the
[31:32] church is failing if he said it in 1960
[31:36] we ought to be able to say it in
[31:38] 2013 because you know why we're still
[31:40] here that's right that's right we get
[31:43] the walk right the change is going to
[31:45] continue and we're going to be changed
[31:47] and get out of here but until we do
[31:48] until we change the
[31:50] Walk we're still going to be here that's
[31:52] right cuz he said that's where the
[31:53] church is failing now failures don't go
[31:55] into Rapture that's right so we got to
[31:57] change something's got to change to put
[31:59] that positive instead of a failure and
[32:01] there's where the church is failing
[32:02] today on that walk do you know that even
[32:04] your own behavior can knock somebody
[32:07] else out of getting
[32:08] healed and you know he sees that I mean
[32:11] he's a prophet he looks out in the
[32:13] congregation and he sees that black
[32:14] thing raise up cuz he sees Spirits when
[32:17] he's when he's Discerning he sees those
[32:20] things he'll see some black you know
[32:22] he'll say it looks like a black cat one
[32:23] time he say like a black cat would pop
[32:25] up or a black street would go across
[32:27] cross from one to the other he'd say
[32:29] those Spirits are screaming at each
[32:31] other knowing they're fixing to be
[32:32] exposed well see it wasn't those people
[32:35] probably didn't
[32:37] know that there was a black street
[32:39] running from their head over to somebody
[32:41] else's but whatever they held in their
[32:45] heart right whatever they held and that
[32:47] doesn't mean they weren't Christians
[32:49] it's just they had a spirit on them all
[32:50] right cuz watch this next one look lady
[32:53] death knocks at your door faith of the
[32:55] African trip 1952 you believe me to be
[32:58] his Prophet if you'll just turn to God
[32:59] and God will return to
[33:01] you the lady says now I got a question
[33:04] to ask the lady speaks to brother rown
[33:05] that is true lady what I mean is true
[33:08] you listen to what backsliding didn't
[33:10] mean that you're gone somewhere and with
[33:12] a man I'm a little bit of a calvinist
[33:14] see not that radical type but I am
[33:16] calvinist you was born again so he felt
[33:19] that familiar Spirit he felt the holy
[33:22] spirit so it was a familiar Spirit it
[33:24] was the right spirit so he felt that all
[33:26] right
[33:28] right but you back slid away from your
[33:31] calling from
[33:33] God right isn't that right and you
[33:36] should have went and done something but
[33:38] you felt like you wasn't able to do it
[33:41] that was the spirit that was keeping
[33:43] that lady from being healed was just she
[33:45] was just had backslid away from what God
[33:48] had called her to wow something so
[33:52] simple as
[33:54] that it's just that's what he said
[33:56] backsliding running away from your
[33:57] calling from
[33:59] God and you should have went and done
[34:01] something in other words what is that
[34:04] that's iniquity iniquity is knowing to
[34:06] do something and you don't go do it or
[34:08] going and do something knowing that it's
[34:10] wrong so she had iniquity in her heart
[34:13] and brother random is calling this thing
[34:15] out and and I'm sure I didn't get the
[34:17] rest of the quote but and I'll I'll find
[34:19] out the lady was
[34:21] healed cuz she asked for forgiveness
[34:24] that's all you got to do when you
[34:25] approach God ask for for forgiveness you
[34:27] know but I'm prise you one
[34:31] thing like Jesus told that prostitute he
[34:34] said go and said your sins are forgiven
[34:36] he said go and send no more send no
[34:39] more L A worst thing come upon you go
[34:42] and send no more all right if she was
[34:45] wrong and she went back to the calling
[34:47] of God then God healed her and she went
[34:50] on as a Christian lady but she was born
[34:52] again you was born again but you
[34:56] backslid all right God's way that's been
[34:58] made for us
[34:59] 1952 all right I followed up another man
[35:02] here not long ago where they talk about
[35:03] a lot of this said he went one city and
[35:05] had 5,000 conversions we followed right
[35:08] behind not me a group of ministers and
[35:10] took the card and followed him back and
[35:12] in 30 days time you couldn't find 30
[35:14] that claim to be saved you know what I
[35:16] think I think it's conviction instead of
[35:19] conversion when a man is born again the
[35:22] spirit of God what we need today is not
[35:24] a ProTrac of meeting
[35:28] in other words just say God I'm sorry
[35:32] and remember you know people find Jesus
[35:35] in jail you know that's a that's a a
[35:37] quote that a lot of people you know a
[35:39] judge will always tell you that if a guy
[35:41] comes up before him he's always got a
[35:43] Bible and he's got his hair cut well the
[35:44] lawyer tells him to do that why because
[35:47] it's an outward appearance that maybe
[35:49] something has changed right at least it
[35:51] gives an impression right well see
[35:53] that's a
[35:55] conviction not a conver I right because
[35:58] you let the guy go another 2 or three
[36:00] months or let him out and he's going if
[36:01] he's still got the same Devil in him
[36:03] he's going to go do the same thing he
[36:04] was all right same way with you and
[36:06] I there are spirits that control our
[36:09] life evil ones and good ones well I
[36:13] don't care who you are brother brandham
[36:15] said he had them all right what we need
[36:19] to do is just figure out which one
[36:20] controls and brother Bown said the old
[36:22] like the old Indian said which one wins
[36:24] he said the one I feed the most okay
[36:27] what we need today is not a protracted
[36:28] meeting but an oldfashioned God sent
[36:30] Holy Ghost Revival an old time sky blue
[36:32] sin killing blood wash religion amen
[36:34] makes you take them tire tools back and
[36:36] do repentance somebody must have stole
[36:38] some tire
[36:40] tools somebody in that audience I'll
[36:43] guarantee you he picked up on that and
[36:45] I'll bet you whoever that was
[36:49] went they make you I mean why do you
[36:51] pick TI toes somebody stole some tiar
[36:54] toes and needed to take them back
[36:57] and do
[36:59] repentance Joy you still for
[37:01] dark I don't know how to use okay yeah
[37:04] if you're going to steal something you
[37:05] might as well steal something you can
[37:06] use right all right let's go Lord bless
[37:09] you read The Book of Proverbs if you
[37:11] want to if you don't we're still going
[37:13] to stay in Proverbs probably a month or
