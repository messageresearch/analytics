[8:37] need to be anointed to hear it so Lord
[8:40] just open our eyes as we sing of our
[8:43] heart that we may see you we love you
[8:46] and we thank you in Jesus name
[8:48] amen Revelations 1
[8:51] 1-3 this is 81 times we've read it so
[8:55] everybody ought to know a little bit
[8:57] about it by now but uh kind of slow and
[9:00] just try to progress through the Book of
[9:02] Revelation says the revelation of Jesus
[9:04] Christ which God gave unto him to you
[9:06] unto his servant things which must
[9:08] shortly come to pass and he said and
[9:10] signified it by his Angel unto his
[9:12] servant John who by record of the word
[9:15] of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ
[9:18] and of all things that he saw blessed is
[9:20] he that readeth and they that hear the
[9:22] words of this prophecy keep those things
[9:25] which are written to our end for what
[9:27] now the time is that hand what time the
[9:31] time to understand am cuz it's not
[9:33] another time you know this is the time
[9:35] to understand all right Revelations
[9:39] 15 and I saw another sign in heaven
[9:42] great and marvelous seven angels having
[9:45] the seven life's plagues where in them
[9:47] is full in them is filled up the wrath
[9:50] of God I saw as it were a sea of glass
[9:54] mingled with fire and them that had
[9:56] gotten the victory over the Beast and
[9:58] over His Image and over his Mark and
[10:01] over the number of his name stand on the
[10:04] sea of GL having the hearts of God and
[10:08] they sang the song of Moses the servant
[10:11] of God and the song of the lamb saying
[10:13] great and marvelous are thy Works Lord
[10:16] God Almighty just and true are thy ways
[10:20] thy king of saints who shall not fear
[10:24] thee Oh Lord and glorify thy name for
[10:27] thou only art holy for all nations shall
[10:31] come and worship before thee for thy
[10:33] judgments are made manifest you may be
[10:36] seated the Lord at his Blessing to the
[10:39] reading of the word
[10:42] now we have
[10:44] been for as I said this is 81 sermons on
[10:50] on the study on the Book of
[10:51] Revelations and just kind of going
[10:54] through taking what we see and not
[10:57] covering everything but
[10:59] covering kind of up to where you know
[11:02] the day that we're
[11:03] living I've been reading a book that
[11:06] sister Trudy let me read on the it's
[11:10] Abbi e Ean every how you pronounced his
[11:12] name wrote a book back somewhere about
[11:14] 1965 about the children of Israel
[11:18] showing their beginnings and showing the
[11:20] travel the journeys their persecutions
[11:23] the the things all the way down uh up
[11:26] until that time and I really enjoyed
[11:29] that because it went right with what
[11:31] here you know I wanted to get over the
[11:33] end of the book but I still read the
[11:35] first parts of it to understand what the
[11:38] man was saying and uh you know to get
[11:41] that done and and then now get into
[11:43] where we're at right cuz I wanted to see
[11:45] what he was talking about Israel of
[11:46] today and all but it ended about 65 and
[11:50] that was when I think he quit writing
[11:52] but I really enjoyed it because it goes
[11:54] in here because we know that the Book of
[11:57] Revelations from Revel aans 4:1 is the
[12:01] rapture of the bride of Christ amen all
[12:04] right and then being that then we are
[12:06] seen only then in the fifth chapter
[12:10] right as to being taken up to heaven
[12:13] because that's a Heavenly scene you
[12:14] remember the question they asked the
[12:16] prophet and he answered it wrong he said
[12:19] that was not the bride and then uh
[12:21] someone he said there's something wrong
[12:23] you know Etc things went on and finally
[12:25] somebody told him to read his which was
[12:26] brother Ned Aon from s and told him to
[12:29] reread his scripture when he did he said
[12:32] he was wrong he said that was the Bride
[12:34] of Jesus Christ in heaven right all
[12:36] right and that way then we seen that the
[12:40] uh the parts that we understand that
[12:43] Israel the Millennium will be to Israel
[12:46] right and you know we're there on a
[12:49] honeymoon right uh you know to to be
[12:52] there and but that part that we we we're
[12:56] looking at is that from revelation they
[12:59] like 41 up we go up you start actually
[13:02] over in Revelations 5 the opening of the
[13:04] seals and the things glad to have our
[13:07] visitors with us that was a brother I
[13:09] guess that called me good to see you
[13:10] brother that's right God bless you yeah
[13:13] and uh this from Gana is that right
[13:18] Ghana Ghana Ghana I always get the
[13:20] places wrong so don't worry about it all
[13:23] right glad to have you with us welcome
[13:25] we always say when you come one time
[13:26] here you're a visitor two times you're
[13:28] part of us Amen Brother P and them and
[13:30] these others we talked about while ago
[13:32] they're part of us they've been here
[13:33] before we glad to have you with us so we
[13:36] we we're
[13:38] saying the prophet of God said the bride
[13:41] bride goes up in Revelations 4:1 right
[13:44] and it's not seen anymore until 19 he
[13:47] goes actually over to verse 21 on on his
[13:50] doings and uh see then we look at it and
[13:54] we see that the Bible is not what we
[13:57] think it is and it's not out of order
[13:59] right I've had a lot of people try to
[14:01] tell me that the Book of Revelations is
[14:02] not in order well I would like to to
[14:05] talk with you a little bit and see cuz
[14:07] your Prophet said that the end and buts
[14:09] was in order all right it's correct it's
[14:12] perfect if you understand what it's
[14:15] talking about am so then the Book of
[14:17] Revelations from
[14:19] Revelations uh 41 as the bride going up
[14:22] we see her in say in chapter 5 she's in
[14:25] heaven right all right and the scene in
[14:29] you see there is the uh the point of 24
[14:34] Elders which is the 12 apostles and 12
[14:37] Patriarchs you see the Beast you see all
[14:40] of the things in Revelations uh five to
[14:43] show you that Revelations 5 is the bride
[14:47] in glory and she's fixing to go from D
[14:50] because that's the marriage supper right
[14:52] amen and see you got 3 and 1/2 years of
[14:54] tribulation to the Jews after the
[14:57] Rapture of the church right all right
[14:59] and then we come back into Millennium on
[15:01] a
[15:02] honeymoon and all and and and from not
[15:05] from four there over to 19 is to
[15:10] Israel you see a lot of people will say
[15:12] you know what do you mean we're in
[15:13] Revelations
[15:15] 107 well if you go back and get
[15:17] Revelations 10 and bring it in correctly
[15:20] you'll see that brother randam says
[15:21] Revelations 101 is exactly the same as
[15:25] Revelations 11213 and there where that
[15:28] the the the one standing in the midst of
[15:30] the golden candlesticks right like unto
[15:32] the son of man G about the PS it's a
[15:34] feminist description right and
[15:37] Revelation 10 then does we don't have to
[15:39] go over there in the tribulation for
[15:41] that to be fulfilled we're here prior to
[15:44] the tribulation taking place but it's a
[15:47] compound meaning amen see there's
[15:49] compound meaning you remember to the
[15:51] Bible and even compound Revelation now
[15:54] compound meanings and compound
[15:55] Revelation as I try to explain is not
[15:58] that you see a trinity and I see one God
[16:00] right now that's not compound that's
[16:04] confusion all right that's not compound
[16:07] compound is when you take like the
[16:09] prophet said there was Israel coming up
[16:12] out of Egypt I brought my son out of
[16:14] Egypt but it was the main thing you
[16:16] remember when Jesus was born they took
[16:18] him to Egypt to get away from the
[16:21] killings and the things so when Jesus
[16:24] come forth he come out of Egypt right
[16:26] amen so then you got to come meaning
[16:29] that what the children of Israel and
[16:32] Jesus Christ compound meaning all right
[16:35] Revelation 10:7 right is the bride's
[16:38] message that we receive all right four
[16:42] through there the Thunders the opening
[16:44] we get the revelation of the book right
[16:46] we don't have to be there when
[16:47] everything takes place because we go up
[16:51] right and and these things take place so
[16:53] we get the revelation of it but then
[16:55] it's this message see watch the compound
[16:58] we get get the message we're getting it
[17:00] now before the tribulation right we
[17:03] understand the prophet's message we can
[17:04] understand the Book of Revelation we can
[17:06] see those things and thank God for it
[17:09] but we're not going to be over there but
[17:11] you know what it's this message righten
[17:14] yeah this message will go to Israel not
[17:17] a bunch of books but it'll be two
[17:20] prophets amen with the revelation of
[17:23] Jesus Christ and they will tell them
[17:26] about this message amen cu they must
[17:28] tell them about it they must tell them
[17:30] said you missed
[17:32] it but the bride has received it and
[17:35] they done gone into Glory you missed it
[17:37] back there when you crucified Christ you
[17:40] brought all these things on you to the
[17:42] Israelites been scattered to the world
[17:44] and persecuted ever since still are
[17:46] being persecuted amen all right but yet
[17:49] still see the compound meaning right the
[17:53] compound meaning to the scriptures then
[17:56] all right see then we can go through re
[17:58] rations 18:4 said come out of her my
[18:00] people yep that's right all right that
[18:03] tells us to come out of the organized
[18:04] religion amen but it's telling Israel to
[18:07] come away from the Covenant you know the
[18:10] 144,000 will come away from the Covenant
[18:13] that is made with the Antichrist so
[18:15] what's compound meaning it don't mean we
[18:18] have to be over there cuz the bride goes
[18:20] up for one she's in heaven in chapter 5
[18:24] the seals are to Israel we get the
[18:27] revelation the I don't want to see the
[18:30] man of sin sitting in the temple of God
[18:32] showing himself to be as God if we do we
[18:35] miss the
[18:36] Rapture right but around they ask him
[18:39] did that fulfill the first seal he said
[18:41] yes I certainly don't want to be around
[18:43] like we get this afternoon maybe
[18:46] Armageddon I don't want to be here when
[18:48] Armageddon takes place I certainly don't
[18:50] want to be here in the tribulation
[18:52] that's what we're going to try to get to
[18:54] in a second about it of what we
[18:56] miss what we miss
[18:58] yes by being the bride of Christ that's
[19:02] what I want to cover in a minute but I
[19:03] want to get these other things out of
[19:05] the way so then really in the Book of
[19:08] Revelations you go from chapter 5 you go
[19:11] over into chapter 6 you think about it
[19:14] chapter 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 and
[19:20] even going into chapter
[19:22] 16
[19:24] yep is to Israel yeah right all right
[19:28] right we get a compound meaning coming
[19:29] back we can read this and understand it
[19:33] and see what the Bible is speaking to us
[19:36] but the main thing will happen there the
[19:38] literal happening will take and you know
[19:40] that's only a 3 and 1/2 year period
[19:43] right yep what about all of those
[19:47] chapters all of those chapters that we
[19:49] read is only 3 and 1/2 years period of
[19:53] time all right but it's like to me like
[19:56] I've tried to tell you it's like the
[19:57] book of Daniel you read the book of
[20:00] Daniel and you read and he has one dream
[20:03] Vision or whatever you read and he has
[20:05] another one he has another one he has
[20:07] another one that's a continuation that's
[20:09] just like seeing the dream and stop it
[20:11] seeing the dream and stop have you ever
[20:13] done
[20:14] that have you ever been dreaming you
[20:16] wake up you think Lord God what am I
[20:19] dreaming that
[20:20] far you say I'm going to get up go get
[20:22] me some water I'm going to go to the
[20:24] bathroom I'm going to get rid of this
[20:25] thing and even pray and say and go lay
[20:28] back down and the dream starts right
[20:29] over where you left off you ever done
[20:31] that well see that's what I'm trying to
[20:33] explain about the Book of Daniel it's
[20:35] one thing that he's seeing right the
[20:38] Journey of
[20:39] Israel right so Revelation is seeing the
[20:42] Journey of Israel amen it's not a whole
[20:46] bunch of visions and dreams and it's the
[20:49] one thing showing their Journey right
[20:52] see didn't thank God that he sent us a
[20:54] prophet that we can understand the
[20:56] symbols amen righten
[20:59] y see as long as the symbols breaks you
[21:02] can read the book of Revelation read it
[21:04] now and you got in
[21:07] Simplicity right in in very Simplicity
[21:11] right you can see what it means the
[21:14] Beast we look at a
[21:16] beast you know something going across
[21:18] the Earth no it's
[21:21] wrong the red dragon is
[21:24] wrong the old mother horde they admit
[21:26] themselves will get to deceive their own
[21:29] book says that they are
[21:31] Revelations 16 17 you
[21:35] 16 about the harlots and the mother hord
[21:39] they admit it that's they're they're
[21:40] they're doing they're own writings all
[21:43] but you see it we get a revelation of
[21:47] these things right so the title of what
[21:49] I'm trying to get is look what we
[21:51] miss yeah look what we miss amen by
[21:55] being the bride of Christ amen amen
[21:58] right
[21:59] right you realize in the Book of
[22:01] Revelations it covers these thing and
[22:03] I'm not going to read each individual
[22:05] but you read them on through chapter uh
[22:07] 15 or where we were reading going into
[22:09] chapter 16 and read about the
[22:13] plagues that are going to strike the
[22:16] Earth or have been striking the Earth on
[22:17] the way back
[22:19] right the vows which is the plagues
[22:22] right see and you look at it look around
[22:25] the world today I was reading the other
[22:26] day where I forgot how many earthquakes
[22:29] it had in the paper the other day how
[22:30] many earthquakes were taking place in a
[22:32] 24-hour
[22:34] period yeah and the prophet of God said
[22:38] what he said after a
[22:42] series what one after the other after a
[22:45] series of earthquakes he said California
[22:48] will go under
[22:51] right look around the world at the
[22:54] things that are taking place today amen
[22:58] that our Bible being read amen we read
[23:01] in the Book of Revelation where there's
[23:02] a continuation you know he that is and
[23:04] was not and he that is and was not the
[23:06] prophet said a succession of popes way
[23:09] he said it amen well look at this when
[23:12] it just stepped
[23:14] down first time in over 600 years that
[23:17] this man has that somebody has stepped
[23:19] down for being po they always
[23:21] die but see now they're going to vote
[23:23] him in another one R around and sit
[23:25] watch that poke come out of the United
[23:27] States all right
[23:29] but what if this one don't come out of
[23:31] the United States what are you going to
[23:32] say right amen what if they get one out
[23:35] of Germany or somewhere this time what
[23:36] are you going to say it's not whether
[23:39] the pope is who he is that's going to
[23:40] put us in Rapture whether this message
[23:42] is revealed to us or
[23:44] not it's not what we we think of the
[23:48] world out there and what it's doing to
[23:50] put us in the Rapture it's whether the
[23:51] reveal word will bring it or
[23:54] not yeah I'm not looking to say cuz like
[23:56] you say what Brother D don't don't you
[23:58] believe the pope will come out of the
[23:59] United
[24:00] States yeah he said are the Roman
[24:03] Catholic Church would take over cuz you
[24:05] got a little other things to take and
[24:06] they're doing a pretty good job all
[24:09] right but you understand what I'm
[24:10] talking about
[24:12] now we read these
[24:16] things and see what will take place to
[24:20] Israel but by seeing what takes place to
[24:23] Israel we can look back at our own
[24:25] selves and see what's taking place now
[24:28] right right to you and
[24:31] I now you remember there the other day
[24:33] like last Sunday I believe it was where
[24:35] we were covering that Revelations 14
[24:38] where it talks about those three Angels
[24:42] yeah and we gave her brother around said
[24:44] these three Angel he said that's after
[24:46] the seven
[24:47] angels see the seven angels would be the
[24:50] trumpet Angels would be the the seals
[24:52] the Angels the thing he said after
[24:56] these
[24:58] he said come these
[25:01] three and the angel number one chapter
[25:04] 14 there what was it he's the one with
[25:06] the Everlasting gospel right
[25:09] amen well see we looked at that coming
[25:11] down through time trying to figure out
[25:13] what it was and it says that that it's
[25:16] in heaven right
[25:18] right that it's in heaven right but then
[25:22] those on Earth is the one that hear it
[25:23] cuz you read Revelation 14 verse one the
[25:27] people on Earth is the one that receive
[25:29] it right cuz angel don't the the heavens
[25:32] when Satan was kicked
[25:34] out cure he's still up there already
[25:37] getting backward and fussing and
[25:38] everything else but he he he doesn't
[25:40] have the entrance he used to have cuz he
[25:42] was kicked out cuz when we go up the
[25:44] prophet said he then will be totally
[25:45] kicked out all right now quoting him but
[25:49] see those three
[25:52] Angels the Everlasting gospel y they
[25:55] always say forgive me for putting in the
[25:57] cough drop either that or quit cuz Satan
[26:00] has tried his best to stop me for years
[26:02] from being able to preach and I have to
[26:04] I've had to tone down a little bit to
[26:06] keep from being too hollering you know
[26:09] maybe that's pretty good maybe we don't
[26:11] need hollering we
[26:12] need a word but forgive me from having
[26:15] to to do that cuz I've done everything
[26:17] the doctors can't tell me what it is
[26:20] they say it's here they say it's here
[26:21] and they say I don't care where it's at
[26:23] get rid of it but they can't handle that
[26:26] part so all right but forgive me but see
[26:29] those three Angels what about an angel
[26:32] coming to Earth to have an everlasting
[26:35] gospel
[26:38] right now what kind of
[26:40] a what kind of a
[26:43] gospel would be an everlasting gospel
[26:47] right right see now here comes a
[26:51] prophet brother Randon what does this
[26:54] mean that's right of an everlasting
[26:56] gospel for our angel that you said it's
[26:59] not the seven angels
[27:03] right right and he tells us in the mark
[27:07] of the beast 54
[27:11] there that it's the message of
[27:14] justification y That's
[27:18] right all right as I'm trying to get
[27:20] across Wednesday night what is the new
[27:26] birth and those three angels as I said
[27:30] isn't it coincidental and I mean that
[27:33] meaning not that the fact that it is
[27:35] it's it's this gospel amen but isn't it
[27:39] odd that Jesus
[27:42] preached and when he was crucified the
[27:44] prophet said the elements came out of
[27:46] his body water blood and Life to make
[27:50] the new birth that would come on the day
[27:52] of Pentecost all right now then it odd
[27:55] then that Luther would preach the josu
[27:57] live by
[27:58] faith all right and then Wesley would
[28:01] preach
[28:02] sanctification all right and then that
[28:05] the Pentecostals OFA Street 1906 would
[28:09] preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[28:12] brother R says there in the mark of the
[28:13] beast he said the Everlasting gospel is
[28:16] justification
[28:18] right we think it's some kind of a great
[28:21] angel with a great big
[28:23] thing but
[28:25] justification came forth by Martin
[28:27] Luther right to preach a
[28:31] message of the just shall live by faith
[28:33] amen see that message will tie together
[28:36] the entire Bible then
[28:38] righten if you understand what I mean it
[28:40] do we know and you know we've been
[28:42] through it studied it Abraham come
[28:44] through what justification
[28:45] sanctification the baptism the in t
[28:48] right amen he didn't receive those
[28:50] things but he come forth in t right
[28:52] right well see Jesus didn't come forth
[28:54] preaching John preached justification m
[28:57] right to believe on him that was to come
[29:00] Jesus preached sanctification went on
[29:02] into the baptism of the Holy Ghost but
[29:04] then the disciples come forth preaching
[29:06] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and see on
[29:09] the original then they believe the new
[29:11] birth was not just believing right not
[29:16] sanctification but the original
[29:18] Pentecostal Doctrine was what
[29:21] justification sanctification the baptism
[29:24] of the Holy Ghost amen right see then we
[29:27] lost that down Through the
[29:29] Ages and we come out but it's odd that
[29:31] we came out with Luther preaching the
[29:33] justification Wesley preaching
[29:35] sanctification that's not odd that was
[29:38] God's way of doing it and see then the
[29:40] zeusa streets were preaching the baptism
[29:42] of the Holy Ghost right we've been
[29:44] talking a lot on these things in the
[29:46] Bible study really had a good time last
[29:47] night we was about 45 minutes late last
[29:51] night on WE generally quited 8:00 but we
[29:54] got to tied up into adoption amen and I
[29:56] really app appreciate everybody in and
[29:58] you know in putting in their their part
[30:00] I really appreciate that I like to hear
[30:03] what you're saying but you know I I
[30:05] meant to say this last night you ever
[30:07] notice that brother R said he said now
[30:09] Billy Graham he said he has 30,000
[30:12] converts he said he did said he go back
[30:14] in a year I have 30 he said but Paul had
[30:16] one he said go back in a year and said
[30:19] he'd have 30 from that
[30:20] one
[30:22] right but see he said well what's the
[30:24] difference you know but you know what
[30:27] brother Brown said about
[30:30] Paul he said Paul stayed with that
[30:34] man that's why he made tents for a
[30:37] living he didn't have to have somebody
[30:39] supporting him he made tents for a
[30:42] living see he stayed with that man
[30:46] right see we Billy Graham would get him
[30:48] to come to the altar but there was
[30:50] nobody to take them any further I used
[30:53] to question them when I was in the
[30:54] Baptist Church you know I wanted to go
[30:56] further in the gospel but there was
[30:59] nobody there to be able to help me and
[31:01] tell me the the way to go on but see
[31:04] Paul stayed with that man he' go live
[31:08] with him made tense and he'd wind up
[31:12] teaching that man the gospel he would
[31:15] take him through justification
[31:17] sanctification and the baptism of the
[31:19] Holy
[31:21] Ghost Billy Graham might get him to
[31:23] repent that justification not thr off on
[31:26] him way doing he done a great wonderful
[31:29] thing all right if he got 30 out of
[31:32] 30,000 thank God for the 30 right yes
[31:36] sir come on we're not throwing off on
[31:37] nobody all right but those three Angels
[31:41] see of Revelations
[31:43] 14 justification sanctification the
[31:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost y see Paul
[31:48] would just stay with that
[31:50] person you know I mean it's kind of odd
[31:53] but see brother mol I when he introduced
[31:55] me to this message
[31:59] see it was kind of captivated
[32:02] audience because we had an hour and a
[32:04] half riding every day down and an hour
[32:07] and a half
[32:08] back well I didn't want to walk 60 mies
[32:13] you know but we was in a car
[32:16] food and see he would just start
[32:19] talking well he had his unique way he
[32:23] would just start
[32:24] talking well when he got to talking we
[32:27] may be home by then an hour and a half
[32:30] later and he's still talking about
[32:31] something well see that's what he done
[32:33] with me he kept carrying me through
[32:35] right right I've witnessed what Paul
[32:38] would do with his
[32:39] Converse carrying you through and keep
[32:42] on carrying you through brother dick and
[32:43] I brother adderson there we worked
[32:47] together for about over a month the
[32:49] first time and I came to the day Shi
[32:52] where he was at and I was the inspector
[32:54] he was a retiran and and things and and
[32:58] you see I could just talk with him every
[33:00] day well I did I just let him into a
[33:04] trap I didn't jump on to him and scream
[33:06] and holler about organized religions and
[33:09] things I just asked him you know what do
[33:11] you believe and and what's going on and
[33:14] and the main thing I'd seen some signs
[33:16] which I didn't understand but it would
[33:17] say a gothy Atlanta you know going down
[33:20] the road and I said what are these
[33:21] things what does that I knew what the
[33:23] word was but I wanted him to tell me
[33:25] yeah and he yeah he said oh said we're
[33:29] in on that said we do this and we do
[33:30] that I said well praise the Lord he's
[33:32] been in meetings where uh who is it the
[33:34] tamy Fay and then was in meetings and
[33:37] Baker and all of them they've been in
[33:38] all of those Pentecostal style meetings
[33:41] back there and you know witness some
[33:43] things but I just kept on and kept on
[33:47] and you know I let him explain to me
[33:49] what he
[33:50] believe well I believe in God in three
[33:53] persons you know cuz he's like I was he
[33:56] didn't know how to explain
[33:58] it I L him on through until I got him
[34:01] from God in three persons to three
[34:04] manifestations of the same
[34:07] God and we went day after day
[34:11] talking and I said one day I said do you
[34:14] really believe it's three manifestations
[34:15] and not three Gods he said I certainly
[34:18] do I see it now perfectly I said when I
[34:21] going to ask you a
[34:23] question see I didn't know that he had
[34:25] been studying about the water B
[34:27] baptism before then yeah and had it on
[34:30] his mind so I said well tell me about it
[34:34] what about to water
[34:37] baptism he said well I wondered about
[34:39] that too I said well let's talk about it
[34:41] a little so then I got into the water
[34:43] baptism into the name of the Lord Jesus
[34:45] Christ well see then he come right on in
[34:47] today but my point is I was daily with
[34:50] him Paul was daily with this person that
[34:53] he was dealing with and see maybe he
[34:55] might have had three or four of these
[34:56] deal with he's making tense he's talking
[34:59] to him about the Lord Billy Graham could
[35:01] only get him to repent Hall could carry
[35:04] him on through into the baptism of the
[35:07] Holy Ghost everybody don't just jump on
[35:09] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and get
[35:10] the first thing when you believe that's
[35:12] not exactly allog together scripture
[35:14] amen all right but yet when you do come
[35:18] to
[35:19] that see then you can see that you go on
[35:22] into the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen
[35:24] I believe in a definite just
[35:27] justification absolutely amen I believe
[35:29] in a definite time of sanctification
[35:32] amen and a definite time of the baptism
[35:35] of the Holy Ghost am now if you tell me
[35:37] I got it all at once I'm not going to
[35:39] argue with
[35:41] you I'm not I'm going to argue with you
[35:43] if you say you went to the Altar and
[35:44] went through justification satification
[35:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost and come out
[35:47] with new birth I'm not going to argue
[35:48] with you cuz all things are possible
[35:50] with God right all right amen but I I
[35:53] have to admit I'm going to watch to see
[35:54] what you do right cuz you're going to
[35:57] prove whether you got it or not CU we're
[36:00] going to talk about the word a little
[36:02] bit and then you're going to wind up
[36:04] like some people have done that I've
[36:06] talked to with it you know and the
[36:07] word's going to drive you away but what
[36:10] is my
[36:13] point those three Angels is odd that
[36:16] they
[36:17] preach about how that the things of God
[36:21] and we give him glory and honor and and
[36:24] all of these different things in the
[36:25] hour verse
[36:28] uh 7 of chapter 14 and that's perfectly
[36:32] with justification right then the next
[36:35] one I'm quoting brother Brandon for
[36:36] these things the second Angel says
[36:39] Babylon is Fallen is
[36:41] Fallen well see that's sanctification
[36:44] right amen all right and then verse n
[36:47] says and the third Angel followed them
[36:48] saying with a loud voice and he's
[36:50] talking about the mark of the beast
[36:51] right
[36:52] yep well see that was the third Angel's
[36:55] message that struck the Earth
[36:57] Earth was a zeusa
[37:00] street and preaching the baptism of the
[37:03] Holy Ghost sure they were trinit
[37:05] terorist but they begin to talk about
[37:07] the mark of the beast but then here
[37:10] comes the angel in the end times that
[37:12] was toet to correct where it would fall
[37:15] not an extra one but the angel of God
[37:17] which was brother random come and what
[37:19] was his
[37:21] message get rid of the mark of the bigs
[37:24] right right well see when we leave out
[37:28] of here now to show you the
[37:30] compound when we leave out of here
[37:34] what's going to
[37:35] Israel two witnesses what are they going
[37:38] to
[37:41] preach they ain't going to preach these
[37:43] doctrines to send the message that's
[37:44] right you know cuz you you can't take
[37:46] two Lords to Israel this won't work
[37:50] right now I'm not against all that
[37:51] that's their business you believe what
[37:53] you want to you can believe your big
[37:55] toeses God but just don't ask me to kiss
[37:57] it that's up to you but I'm just saying
[38:01] then you you come down to it and when it
[38:02] down I say this won't go to Israel yeah
[38:05] no well what you believe would it go to
[38:08] Israel that's
[38:09] right you take a God in three person
[38:12] Doctrine and go to Israel what you going
[38:13] to get run out of the country right
[38:15] right you take the doctrines of this
[38:17] message they said Jesus wasn't God until
[38:19] K the River Jordan right y when the
[38:22] Bible said he was born Lord the Christ
[38:24] am you think you take to Israel remember
[38:28] whatever we have is what's going to
[38:30] Israel the true gospel is what's going
[38:32] to Israel right am that comes from this
[38:35] message amen well see when we leave out
[38:38] of here those two witnesses are going to
[38:40] preach
[38:41] justification sanctification and the
[38:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[38:48] 120,000 all right 144,000 excuse
[38:53] me cuz they've got to get them converted
[38:56] that's why it's going to take 3 and 1/2
[38:59] years right they're going to preach 3
[39:01] and 1/2 years to those people right
[39:03] that's right amen and get them
[39:06] converted I'm sure they'll get the
[39:08] baptism of the Holy Ghost yes but they
[39:11] will not be born Sons and Daughters of
[39:13] God because they rejected that right
[39:16] amen they won't be the bride she's done
[39:18] gone right amen amen but they'll receive
[39:22] this message amen yes sir cuz you asked
[39:25] they said Brother D would you sum up
[39:27] brother R's
[39:29] message you know you just asked me say
[39:31] could you sum it up you know what a lot
[39:33] of people would say my message you this
[39:36] other no no what would sum up the gospel
[39:40] justification sanctification the baptism
[39:42] of the Holy Ghost amen cuz if you can't
[39:45] put it under the ey where you going to
[39:46] go with it did not run around get into
[39:48] seventh seal and come over the end of it
[39:50] he's done set on the questions and
[39:52] answers he said it's gone from you
[39:53] there's no way for you to know it but
[39:55] said right around the coming of the the
[39:56] Lord will be made known that's in your
[39:58] conduct your questions and ANW when he
[40:00] gets on the seventh seal he said go on
[40:02] with the same simple message he said
[40:04] because if you don't you'll work
[40:06] yourself away from it what is the same
[40:08] simple message justification
[40:10] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[40:13] Ghost and that's what them two prophets
[40:15] will take to do right it'll take them a
[40:18] long time to to hatch that out and bring
[40:22] it all right they're finally killed for
[40:25] what they believe
[40:27] amen right the two witnesses and all are
[40:29] finally killed amen but what about
[40:33] it I believe the new birth is
[40:35] justification sanctification the baptism
[40:37] and the ho we're not in Luther's day in
[40:39] Luther's day it was to believe God that
[40:41] was justification why because the rest
[40:43] of the word was not there far
[40:46] right see that's the one thing that we
[40:48] missed we were talking about last night
[40:49] my wife always made a good point out of
[40:51] it it was not the holy ghost that was
[40:53] eat down in the Ages come on you're
[40:55] Prophet preach the message in your
[40:57] church age book the holy ghost in every
[41:00] age every age has been the age of the
[41:02] Holy
[41:03] Ghost right see it was not the holy
[41:06] ghost that was eat down it was the word
[41:08] that was eaten
[41:09] down then the Holy Ghost can only work
[41:12] according to the amount of words you
[41:14] have so Luther preaching
[41:17] justification that was all that could be
[41:18] preached but that was the Everlasting
[41:21] gospel right Amen to strike the world
[41:24] Amen they said to Martin Luther said
[41:27] don't you know the whole world is
[41:29] against you he said I want them to know
[41:31] I'm against them
[41:33] right amen cuz he believed what he
[41:37] had sure then it started doing up and
[41:41] down we'll get to it this afternoon
[41:42] brother Brown said the first organized
[41:44] religion was the Catholic
[41:48] Church you know what he said the second
[41:50] one
[41:51] was
[41:52] Luther
[41:55] right third one ziggly or what his name
[41:58] is every which one of them all of them
[42:02] come down to the badst and time right
[42:05] they were the organized religion but the
[42:06] first organized religion you heard
[42:08] brother R say the Catholics say they
[42:09] were the original he said they're
[42:11] exactly
[42:12] right he said I'm an original
[42:16] Catholic right from the day of Pentecost
[42:19] amen right cuz the word Catholic means
[42:23] Universal see when you put Roman on it's
[42:25] when you
[42:27] right he's distinguishing where it's
[42:29] from all right but listen then see that
[42:33] Everlasting
[42:34] gospel and then coming even to that
[42:36] third angel that you and I can associate
[42:39] greatly with to preach about the mark of
[42:41] the
[42:42] beast and this Prophet is telling us
[42:45] about the mark of the beast what is the
[42:47] mark of the beast he
[42:49] said I gave you some quotes there of
[42:52] where he
[42:54] said that Mark of the Beast he he said
[42:56] if you're
[42:57] not he said you've either got one or the
[43:00] other let me make sure my quote's
[43:02] correct you've either got one or the
[43:03] other you've either got the mark of the
[43:05] beast or the Seal of God there's no gray
[43:07] area in
[43:09] between but brother Dell I'm repentant
[43:11] I'm doing this fine but you're not born
[43:13] again till you receive the new birth now
[43:15] if it's Wesley's day or Luther's day you
[43:17] might
[43:18] argue because back there it was that
[43:22] that justification was the baptism of
[43:24] the Holy Ghost right amen
[43:26] even John Wesley teaches in his own
[43:28] message you know of the the
[43:31] sanctification at the baptism of the
[43:33] Holy
[43:34] Ghost and brother Brown give you a
[43:36] direct quote he says that Wesley said
[43:39] Methodist had
[43:40] the baptism of the Holy Ghost for their
[43:44] day because that's what it was it wasn't
[43:48] required for their day but then when
[43:51] ausa Street Struck it was
[43:53] required justification sanctification if
[43:56] the baptism of the Holy Ghost to make
[43:57] the new
[43:58] birth you see then that would put it
[44:01] back as the prophet said the last three
[44:03] messages of the last three ages
[44:06] completed to
[44:07] birth then it's got to come with the
[44:10] word and there's where you Prophet come
[44:13] into VI Amen to bring the message unto
[44:15] us to return us back into the word all
[44:18] right see then we can read the book of
[44:20] Revelation understanding the symbols and
[44:22] the
[44:23] thing and say Glory Hallelujah
[44:27] look at
[44:29] that so what was we talking about
[44:31] Wednesday night what is the new
[44:34] birth well brother Dale I got the new
[44:36] birth I believe you got quotes from
[44:37] Brother
[44:39] Brown he said when you believe sure cuz
[44:42] when you believe you
[44:44] started right y right right you know
[44:47] that that Peter and him
[44:50] believed and they started you know they
[44:53] were Sanctified in St John 17 right
[44:55] right
[44:56] I know Jesus hadn't died yet and that
[44:58] was a potential form sure but it was
[45:02] true but what if they said in the upper
[45:04] room let's take it by faith and walk out
[45:07] they would have never got the new birth
[45:08] and the day of Pentecost would have
[45:09] never taken place am right see isn't it
[45:13] odd then that the ages would tap out
[45:15] exactly isn't it odd that the Israel
[45:18] will Top out exactly that they'll get
[45:20] the message of justification
[45:22] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[45:23] Ghost giving them the new birth yeah for
[45:26] their age and their time amen all
[45:29] right that's not a coincidence to me
[45:32] that's a Wonderful Plan of Salvation cuz
[45:35] what is the Plan of
[45:38] Salvation it's not just believe on the
[45:41] Lord Jesus Christ and thou shal be saved
[45:42] that's the beginning right but has the
[45:45] Holy Ghost accepted you amen see at
[45:48] justification you accept
[45:50] him right you repent of your sins you
[45:53] accept him but if he don't accept you
[45:55] right right that's you don't have the
[45:59] new birth righten and the new birth then
[46:02] is the what the prophet said the birth
[46:03] of the word amen he said you can't be
[46:06] born again without a revelation that's
[46:08] right amen see you remember the man
[46:10] telling him he said I can't take
[46:11] something by Revelation you said well
[46:14] God can't deal with you either
[46:16] that's he can't deal with you it's got
[46:19] to be a revelation what ises that said
[46:21] about Paul he took them they repented of
[46:23] their
[46:24] sins but then they carried on and he
[46:28] kept teaching them teaching them
[46:30] teaching them until they come forth with
[46:33] the new bir amen then he could start
[46:35] talking about second Peter add to your
[46:37] faith virture and all his Temperance
[46:39] patience God and His brotherly kindness
[46:42] Exel but see the new birth is a birth of
[46:44] the word amen cuz the Bible said the
[46:46] disciples you Remember The Parables and
[46:49] some took the word and and the the cares
[46:51] of Life took it away and others you know
[46:53] the things just happened well one of
[46:54] them says there said they took the the
[46:55] word he kept it
[46:57] yeah you know that was the ones in the
[46:59] upper room right you said but if I could
[47:02] just see God if I do you mean I'm not
[47:04] saved let me quote the
[47:07] scripture the Bible
[47:10] says that Jesus was seen of over 500
[47:15] Brethren now I'm quoting scripture
[47:17] right after his resurrection he was seen
[47:20] of over 500 Brethren right now where was
[47:23] the 380 when the day of Pentecost come
[47:26] right come on I just ask simple
[47:29] questions everybody said I'm so deep but
[47:32] I think I'm so simple till I'm
[47:34] stupid a simple question where is the
[47:37] under 380 where did they
[47:39] go they never kept the word no even
[47:42] though they'd seen the resurrected Lord
[47:44] Jesus Christ maybe ate with
[47:47] him maybe heard him preach for the 40
[47:49] days or something he was therey but they
[47:52] never kept that word valuable but that
[47:54] 120 and they went to that upper room and
[47:57] they did the Holy Ghost came you know
[47:59] when that Holy Ghost came it didn't get
[48:00] to
[48:02] 380 now they might have been downstairs
[48:05] when they left cuz there was 3,000 guys
[48:07] the next time that's right that 380
[48:09] might have learned by then and run
[48:11] downstairs I'm not leaving them out but
[48:14] I'm just saying they didn't make it on
[48:16] the first one that's
[48:20] right that new birth is the most
[48:23] valuable thing in the world Amen you
[48:25] realize then what I'm talking about you
[48:27] know that we miss these plagues and we
[48:29] miss these tribulation we miss these
[48:32] things that were that they'll be chunks
[48:34] of ice weighing 200
[48:36] lb falling the Earth you see how in the
[48:40] world I can be I've seen them golf ball
[48:43] size Y A lot of people now seeing them
[48:46] almost baseball sizes and going on up
[48:49] right go now I'm not a scientist I just
[48:52] read so if they're wrong I read it okay
[48:56] what happens is water starts coming
[48:59] down and it
[49:01] freezes if that air current carries it
[49:04] back
[49:05] up scientifically speaking it drops back
[49:08] down yeah you know what it does it keeps
[49:10] gaining moisture so as long as it up and
[49:13] down current is going there that thing
[49:15] getting bigger and bigger you know what
[49:16] a 200 lb block of ice wouldn't be no
[49:18] great big thing we used to buy 100 lb
[49:20] block of ice 100 lb block of ice was
[49:22] only this size come on we used to B them
[49:25] you know we had the old chest freezer we
[49:28] didn't we would like y'all we couldn't
[49:30] afford to
[49:32] the
[49:35] electricity I'm about as bad as my
[49:37] brother said when they was in the cotton
[49:39] mill that time and the boss had caught
[49:40] him goofing off and him and his buddy
[49:43] was standing there and they they had to
[49:44] come up with an excuse while they
[49:45] goofing off and he said what are you
[49:47] doing up
[49:49] here said we look at that life said we
[49:53] want to see how long that thing will go
[49:54] before it goes out
[50:00] we had to fill them up you know all
[50:02] right we train TR the Wicks we done
[50:05] everything I'm a country boy I was pring
[50:06] a mu when I 7 years old so you don't
[50:09] talk to me about hard times but now
[50:13] listen those three
[50:16] Angels bring the message right and they
[50:20] have brought the message to us
[50:21] justification sanctification baptism and
[50:24] they take the message to Israel
[50:25] justification sanctification baptism of
[50:27] the Holy Ghost right amen right and see
[50:30] then we miss these things by having the
[50:33] new birth you remember the part the
[50:35] prophet laid out was so beautiful he
[50:38] said the bride don't go through the
[50:40] tribulation that's right amen he said
[50:43] now we may have persecution cuz look
[50:45] down Through the Ages how they was
[50:46] killed and what was done see for their
[50:49] belief but he said the bride does not go
[50:51] through the tribulation right now that's
[50:54] wonderful whether or not you you think
[50:55] it's very important or not well I don't
[50:57] care any important I just want to make
[50:59] sure I go up well how you going to go up
[51:02] if you don't know where the bus is
[51:06] at right
[51:09] now they might not understand my
[51:11] language like that but you see it's not
[51:13] just a he says he's got it but it's not
[51:16] just a bus pulling up that's going to
[51:19] take us up or an airplan we get on right
[51:23] see we're being born again amen that's
[51:26] what Peter
[51:28] said by The Incorruptible word of God
[51:33] Amen this message came to not only give
[51:37] us a new birth yes but to take us
[51:40] through to the change of the body am
[51:44] there's not another message to come to
[51:45] try to change your body the prophet said
[51:48] Rapture of Faith lays in what these
[51:49] books inent right amen where we going to
[51:54] find a Rapture not out in organized
[51:55] religion they don't even know anything
[51:57] about
[51:58] it n we listen the other night to a tape
[52:01] wife said isn't it marvelous what that
[52:03] man could say and he was talking about
[52:06] how Abraham and Sarah was turned back to
[52:07] a young man and a young woman she said
[52:09] look at there H he said nobody ever T
[52:11] that did he I said
[52:13] no but see I heard him that day say
[52:16] things that I hadn't really thought
[52:17] about as
[52:20] much he said Abraham and Sarah went on
[52:23] and we know that they were turned back
[52:24] to young man the Young woman you know
[52:26] and they had two kids so that proved
[52:28] something
[52:31] happened old grandma and
[52:34] granddaddy right yes 90 and
[52:38] 100 had two babies right but that ain't
[52:42] all the
[52:43] story Sarah passes off Abraham gets
[52:47] married again and got seven more kids
[52:49] that's right y surely something happened
[52:53] to him Butz that would have made
[52:55] what over into the 115 or 117 or
[52:59] whatever you count seven
[53:03] kids how old a man was I sat there and I
[53:05] said God that man was a
[53:08] prophet he know what the word said see
[53:11] we missed all of those things y but yeah
[53:14] we read the same book that's right but
[53:16] it was not meant for us to read it and
[53:18] get it it was meant for him to get it
[53:20] and bring it to
[53:22] us in the end time and it's to change
[53:25] these
[53:26] bodies yes nobody's ever had to deal
[53:29] with a change of the body that's right
[53:31] down Through the Ages nobody they just
[53:34] called they went and and confessed their
[53:37] sins and went forth and doing what they
[53:39] could do and a lot of them had to give
[53:40] their life for what they believe amen
[53:42] right that's right they wern't concerned
[53:44] about the change of the body that's why
[53:46] you wound up an organized religion and
[53:48] you noce there's still people believe in
[53:49] it today but in in this message that
[53:51] organized religion said we're going to
[53:53] get a new body yeah
[53:55] cuz you see they couldn't see the change
[53:56] of this
[53:58] body but in the message today there's
[54:00] still preachers that say we're going to
[54:01] get a new body I want to get this body
[54:03] made new amen amen I'm not going to get
[54:07] this I'm not going to get another the
[54:09] word new can refer to another I'm going
[54:11] to get this body redeemed the prophet
[54:14] said it ain't when you drop something
[54:16] you pick up something else no it's this
[54:20] body redeem Jesus raised with nail
[54:23] prints in his hand am he didn't get a
[54:25] new body right right but you see the
[54:28] preachers in this message teach you to
[54:29] get a new body yeah no and you know the
[54:32] one man that taught it boy he takes it
[54:34] all the way over and I listen to it cuz
[54:35] I want to know what he was just saying I
[54:37] never could figure it out but I want to
[54:39] know what he was just saying and I
[54:40] listen to a good many
[54:42] tapes and come to find out he said well
[54:44] we going to walk out on the AES and the
[54:46] Millennium on top of her own bodies oh
[54:49] my wrong well that's I don't see that
[54:53] one no right but then after a while he
[54:55] brought us through and brought us into
[54:57] the future home back into our bodies
[55:00] yeah well at least he got us back in
[55:02] them yeah no but I just don't see it
[55:06] that way no amen you know that's when I
[55:09] say it and I'm sorry I just preach what
[55:10] I believe
[55:12] amen see then if if we believe it look
[55:16] what we miss
[55:18] amen
[55:20] yeah we miss the fact it it's bad enough
[55:23] today until basically looking at a a 60
[55:27] 70
[55:30] people and you know there's not a person
[55:32] in here doesn't have something wrong
[55:33] with
[55:34] you you agree with
[55:36] that even the little kids they have
[55:39] something wrong with them Nanny pulled
[55:41] one of kayle's teeth today that's part
[55:43] of the curse right she wanted Nanny to
[55:46] pull that too cuz she's pulled a lot of
[55:47] these little kids teeth around here and
[55:49] she just reached in there and snatching
[55:51] of course she got a couple of bucks too
[55:53] I here take a few out
[55:58] but see nobody is healthy anymore a baby
[56:02] used to be born and if it nursed its
[56:04] mother it would hardly ever get sick for
[56:06] the first 6 months why is it that you
[56:09] want the baby
[56:10] c yeah Zach is into that you take a baby
[56:14] calf and it's
[56:16] born you go around and buy you some good
[56:19] old fashion
[56:22] milk but they'll die they need that milk
[56:26] that comes from that
[56:27] Mama right and they say within what the
[56:30] first 24 hours or something if they
[56:33] don't get that milk deterioration starts
[56:36] if they don't get that first milk from
[56:38] that mother things start setting up they
[56:41] have two stomachs one of them is not
[56:42] even formed until it's 21 days old you
[56:45] try to feed it all you want to and
[56:46] you'll kill it yeah why because it go
[56:48] into that stomach and not not
[56:52] digest see church God is one wonder he
[56:56] put within the human body yes sir the
[56:58] ability for it to fight off these
[57:01] diseases the age is taking us down
[57:04] deteriation is taking us
[57:07] away but yet we're just one step from
[57:12] eternity one
[57:14] step into leaving out of this
[57:18] worldl thank you Jesus see why because
[57:20] we went through justification
[57:22] sanctification get the new birth yes sir
[57:25] and then we go through the adoption as
[57:27] we were talking about last night right
[57:29] amen and we come out to the headstone
[57:31] where the bride and the prophet of God
[57:32] said one of these days there'll be such
[57:34] a baptism when the Holy Ghost will come
[57:36] that it'll fill every fiber of our being
[57:38] I'm looking forward to that amen it may
[57:41] be he said a short
[57:42] time but he said it's coming amen he
[57:46] said he become visible Among Us and
[57:48] raise the dead and we go into Rapture
[57:50] now visible visible is not Corporal no
[57:54] no cuz his Corporal body don't step here
[57:56] till the millennial Reign we are his
[57:58] body amen he don't need to come here CU
[58:00] it'd be two bodies right he being his we
[58:04] being ours that won't work out until we
[58:07] get into Glory right then we can see him
[58:10] and
[58:11] us but here he don't need a body down
[58:13] here we are his body right the Bride of
[58:17] Jesus Christ aren you following me see
[58:20] then it's so wonderful to realize what
[58:21] we
[58:23] miss we miss these things to where
[58:28] the the animals will eat off the
[58:30] people's bodies while they're
[58:32] alive that's
[58:37] right we miss that amen we miss all
[58:40] these plagues right that's why I read
[58:43] these things in chapter 15 and going
[58:45] into 16 about the vows the plagues that
[58:48] are right read them that's right see
[58:52] what we miss we said I can't figure that
[58:55] out pain
[58:58] sensible without trying to have it a
[59:00] great
[59:01] Revelation think sensible look what it
[59:04] says in chapter 16:2 and the first went
[59:08] first V first plate and poured out his V
[59:11] upon the Earth and there fell a noisome
[59:14] great not noisy loudy right you know not
[59:17] loud noisome and you know and Grievous
[59:21] SAR upon the men which had the mark of
[59:23] the beast and upon them which worshiped
[59:25] this
[59:29] image come on there's hardly anybody in
[59:32] the building it doesn't have some kind
[59:33] of imperfection as I say some kind of a
[59:36] an itch some kind of a a pimple sticking
[59:40] out some kind of a
[59:42] sore just CA sister Peggy got a black
[59:45] eye it wasn't
[59:48] D she won't tell us totally what that is
[59:51] but she's got a black spot on her
[59:55] huh get you to think I don't make jokes
[59:58] for jokes I make thoughts for to think
[1:00:01] of it
[1:00:02] right see sometimes you get serious and
[1:00:04] you die down on something you realize
[1:00:06] folks that there's things happening now
[1:00:10] the prophet back in the ' 50s talking
[1:00:11] about a child he was praying for that
[1:00:14] had what they call a Chalk's disease in
[1:00:16] the
[1:00:18] 50s if they went very long they just
[1:00:20] turn into chalk they just dry up and
[1:00:22] just crack and just finish
[1:00:26] y he said that they come such things
[1:00:29] upon the Earth that cancer would
[1:00:31] toothache that's a direct quote you want
[1:00:33] it cancer would be like a toothache
[1:00:37] compared to what's coming look at it
[1:00:41] today they don't know what to tell you
[1:00:44] that's right right well try is that's
[1:00:47] what it's practic in
[1:00:48] medicine try this try that did that work
[1:00:53] okay I'll write in the book
[1:00:55] yeah right that's right am years ago it
[1:00:59] was a bad thing came around here and
[1:01:00] it's pretty well like it now but the
[1:01:02] kids and all it just got back in the the
[1:01:04] 60s there you just coughing like
[1:01:06] everything

[1:01:10] say
[1:01:11] it said go get you some
[1:01:14] whiskey and some rock
[1:01:16] candy and some lemon juice you know some
[1:01:19] of them had different ideas but they
[1:01:22] give it to the kids said stop for
[1:01:26] cough give my kid no whiskey that cough
[1:01:29] drop I put in my mouth got more alcohol
[1:01:31] in it dried up

[1:01:43] wine go take your a sip of a of a cough
[1:01:48] syrup then read on the bottle and it

[1:01:53] alcohol you just drank more than one cup
[1:01:56] of wine would ever have any cu it's only
[1:01:58] like 12% at the most right but you see
[1:02:02] we think we're
[1:02:05] smart we don't believe in this out of
[1:02:07] dinner I don't believe in drinking
[1:02:09] either age no
[1:02:12] way but I believe in taking
[1:02:14] communion we will do that the Lord
[1:02:16] willing this
[1:02:19] afternoon right and it's like I said to
[1:02:22] you you say well an alcoholic don't need
[1:02:24] take a taste of liquor because if he
[1:02:26] takes another taste he turn back to an
[1:02:27] alcoholic that's true if he ain't born
[1:02:30] again yes sir that's probably true if he
[1:02:33] ain't born again but if he's born again
[1:02:36] ain't going to bother him am why cuz
[1:02:39] God's going to take care of it that's
[1:02:41] right I'm not going to give him grape
[1:02:42] juice and just do without taking
[1:02:45] it grape juice will rotten they talk of
[1:02:48] the blood of Christ we Baptist used to
[1:02:50] order a bread and we used to take
[1:02:51] communion every 3 months so we'd order a
[1:02:53] bag from the publishing house and we
[1:02:55] keep the bag of
[1:02:57] of little crumbs of bread I mean we had
[1:03:00] a little bit wafer looking thing yeah
[1:03:02] what you call them little square things
[1:03:04] and we keep them for a whole year put
[1:03:06] them up in the freezer and just freeze
[1:03:07] them back and keep them for the next 3
[1:03:09] months when the Bible say it's burn the
[1:03:11] bread the next day before the next day
[1:03:13] comes burn the bread see we thought
[1:03:16] we're smart but anyhow
[1:03:19] listen we miss these
[1:03:23] plagues y by having the new birth
[1:03:28] amen God is not going to come upon them
[1:03:30] with a new birth y now let me explain
[1:03:33] that cuz that goes into carnality in
[1:03:35] man's mind
[1:03:36] right just because when you're a
[1:03:39] Christian don't mean that you're not
[1:03:40] subject to diseases and
[1:03:44] things right we're still human we can
[1:03:48] still get sick the prophet of God was
[1:03:51] sick Jehovah Gyra series we just
[1:03:53] listened to him and in gr Valley
[1:03:55] California and there he was praying for
[1:03:57] the sick to be healed the dead raised
[1:03:58] and all kind of things happen you know
[1:03:59] what he's doing he's going to the doctor
[1:04:01] every
[1:04:02] day he says it is
[1:04:05] s see we're not against doctors we just
[1:04:08] don't put doctors as the healers we
[1:04:10] thank God for doctors brother Rand would
[1:04:12] tell a man he told one one time he said
[1:04:14] he come up told him said I got a problem
[1:04:16] my stomach he said yes it there's a
[1:04:17] doctor down here do those operations go
[1:04:19] let him operate on that's right a
[1:04:22] prophet look what he said thus say the
[1:04:24] Lord is
[1:04:26] gone like the brother here W back was
[1:04:28] saying he's praying for a lady one day
[1:04:31] and he said you're just going through
[1:04:32] the change of
[1:04:34] life he said if I asked all the women
[1:04:36] out here to raise your hand he said
[1:04:37] probably 90% of them be going through
[1:04:39] the change of
[1:04:40] life well he went ahead and pray for the
[1:04:42] lady but he was simply explaining that
[1:04:45] we're under the
[1:04:47] curse we don't believe in immortality In
[1:04:50] the Flesh until the change of the body
[1:04:52] amen now that was AI Doctrine right some
[1:04:56] of you don't know about them but he let
[1:04:57] his heart grow out call it out different
[1:04:59] said he wasn't getting older that didn't
[1:05:01] make no difference he
[1:05:02] died but he taught immortality in the F
[1:05:05] flesh they said that now this is a quote
[1:05:07] from somebody else okay they said they
[1:05:10] asked brother Brown about it and said
[1:05:11] brother rown said he gets my
[1:05:14] tapes see brother Brown never taught
[1:05:16] immortality In the Flesh uh you know the
[1:05:19] fact we ain't going to get older but he
[1:05:21] did teach that there's going to be a
[1:05:23] change
[1:05:25] and we're going to have an eternal
[1:05:28] body cuz that'll be the completion of
[1:05:30] our new
[1:05:31] birth see when we walk out of here in
[1:05:33] the Rapture and going up through the
[1:05:34] iron you can look over Brother Gary and
[1:05:36] you say Brother Gary I'm born
[1:05:38] again cuz the new birth is a birth is a
[1:05:40] coming forth into we're going to come
[1:05:42] forth into a glorified
[1:05:45] state to walk with Jesus and be as he
[1:05:50] was but we miss all of these things
[1:05:55] we miss all of these plagues and these
[1:05:57] vows and these horrible
[1:05:59] things that are coming upon the Earth
[1:06:04] yeah but see look at it we're still here
[1:06:07] we're we're still subject to these
[1:06:09] things yeah
[1:06:11] right but we're not tied by them
[1:06:16] amen and I'm going to tell you what I
[1:06:18] believe whether you believe this or not
[1:06:20] but I believe if you're a born again
[1:06:23] Christian
[1:06:26] two bornn again Christians a man and his
[1:06:28] wife and they're truly Christians born
[1:06:33] again that Born Again experience ends
[1:06:36] the chain of the bringing down
[1:06:40] diseases right that you say mama was
[1:06:44] this and Daddy was this and Grandpa was
[1:06:46] this and grandpa had high blood
[1:06:49] pressure you you see you're missing the
[1:06:52] point I I thought we believed in an
[1:06:56] atonement see you say I got high blood
[1:06:58] pressure CA Grandma had it mama had it
[1:07:01] Daddy had you're inviting those things
[1:07:03] to stay with
[1:07:05] you but we believe in healing don't
[1:07:08] we well why can't we believe that we'll
[1:07:10] get born
[1:07:11] again that that can stop that visited
[1:07:16] iniquity
[1:07:19] right if you come along and say well
[1:07:22] I've got high blood pressure
[1:07:25] you invited it to come especially when
[1:07:28] you say it come from Grandma
[1:07:31] Grandpa why not say the blood of Jesus
[1:07:33] Christ atones for all
[1:07:36] things and can end that line of visited
[1:07:40] iniquity because even under visited
[1:07:43] iniquity
[1:07:45] remember that after 400
[1:07:48] years it was
[1:07:51] gone am I in the Bible yes right 10
[1:07:55] Generations 40 years to the generation
[1:07:58] after that 400 years you could come back
[1:07:59] into the
[1:08:01] congregation your your genealogies could
[1:08:04] why because it bled its way out why
[1:08:07] can't we believe in the blood of Jesus
[1:08:08] Christ stoping
[1:08:10] it thank but see that's what we do we go
[1:08:12] down to the doctor and the doctor says
[1:08:14] your blood pressure is going up did your
[1:08:17] daddy had it yep yep he died with
[1:08:21] it he had two strokes I'm talking to my
[1:08:23] daddy had two strokes that killed
[1:08:26] him high blood pressure probably cuz he
[1:08:28] didn't know sure I take blood pressure
[1:08:30] medicine thank God for
[1:08:32] it but I'm not dependent upon that I'm
[1:08:36] dependent upon the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:08:39] heard take the other night me and my
[1:08:40] wife and I said honey I've said that all
[1:08:41] long we were sitting there listening you

[1:08:59] of healings and signs and
[1:09:04] wonders and why can't we believe
[1:09:07] it why can't we believe that he could
[1:09:10] take care of all
[1:09:12] things right amen that he can cover all
[1:09:16] of our problems that's right through the
[1:09:19] blood of Jesus Christ amen he said this

[1:10:10] confidence in the doctor you're doing
[1:10:12] what he's saying let the doctor tell you
[1:10:14] you don't need that
[1:10:15] anymore with brother call his wife
[1:10:18] sister Ruth years ago they took out her
[1:10:21] Peary gland which suppli all of the
[1:10:24] hormones of situations or whatever you

[1:10:38] I me come on I do that in my in what we
[1:10:41] call the medicine cabinet to the house
[1:10:42] there's a pray cloth stuck up
[1:10:45] there I tell you when you get medicine
[1:10:47] from the doctor sanctify what's the
[1:10:50] matter you sanctify your food why don't

[1:10:56] she said what do we do I said let's pray
[1:10:57] over and
[1:11:00] sanctify few months later she kind of
[1:11:03] having problems she went to the doctor
[1:11:06] and the doctor says you got too much
[1:11:09] insulin they didn't have nothing to
[1:11:11] produce
[1:11:13] it that's right you know what they done
[1:11:15] they took her off of it praise the Lord
[1:11:18] you know what she never did take no more
[1:11:20] inst amen right
[1:11:25] and there was no gland to produce the
[1:11:29] insulin oh that was just an accident she
[1:11:32] had two glands well go ahead and do what
[1:11:33] you want to with it I say God healed
[1:11:38] her and if she did have two GL God
[1:11:41] healed her before she started but he
[1:11:44] gave her two gland
