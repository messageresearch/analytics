your hand at this time any any other time lord always want to hear a special but uh if not at this time I'd like to ask sister n to give her testimony the Nicaragua CH God bless you Saints I'm sorry I'm really nervous um first I just want to start by um thanking brother and sister uro for um arranging everything and taking care of all of us and being the best tour guides um I want to thank my parents mom and dad for allowing me to go um I'm sorry so as you know we were supposed to um reach managa um Wednesday but um we only got to Houston and um um after we got out off the plane um we went in this line to see if we can um get another flight basically for that day or if they could schedule another flight and um everyone was just tired and hungry and just exhausted um I know and um the lesson I really learned from that was just putting it into the Lord's hands because we were like you know if it's if it's not your will Lord we won't go um maybe brother Louise and brother Bob can go but everyone else would just you know go home but um I really learned to just you know pray about and just put into the Lord's hands and he just makes a way and um that was that was a that was a real blessing um we so we um we got a flight for Friday and there was exactly you know eight seats and there was eight people so you know that was a real miracle and I just want to thank the Lord for that um in Nicaragua what um my gist of it was you know from washing dishes by hand and um being in Believers homes that didn't you know had um dirt flooring or um using out houses all I could see was just the happiness in their eyes and their hearts and how serious they were about the Lord how content they were and I just wish that we could be more like that you know um to have very little and still put God above everything and um I just love being with them the atmosphere the really sweet people s they're just wonderful brothers and sisters and honestly when Christine and them go back I'm on the next flly back it was just a real blessing and um putting all of these things into perspective has just moved my heart closer to the Lord and I was very humbled by this experience so thank you all for praying with us praying for us it was just a real blessing thank you amen I will now give my testimony of the trip um once again if anyone has a special don't be afraid to raise your hand uh actually I can start off with that that in Nicaragua almost every uh service we went to there was at least like four or five specialist so maybe we could think about that and just feel free to come up but um uh know I want to thank uh uh brother Lis Sister Christine for uh facilitating the whole trip you know allowing us to you know they know people and allowing us to go with them and and for the church and all the donations and everything that really helped out uh with the trip especially once start our flights got uh delayed and canceled and all that you know your money really kept us afloat that we were able to stay at a hotel you know and because God wanted us to go on this trip like in said there was only eight seats and sorry there was only eight seats and uh we were able to all eight of us were able to get on so like like Jala said that was really a miracle and God really wanted us to go so so thank you for your donations uh everyone if your first language is English please raise your hand that's wonderful okay I think we should all thank God that our first language first language is English because this message came in English and we're all able to easily read it read the tapes read the books listen to the message and and in different parts of the country where the the first language isn't English they need interpreters they need translators they need all these different we need they need people from here to go over there who know both languages many people like maybe brother Bob who only knows one language but he can't just go by himself and need someone like brother Louise and there's just so much more that there's so many more barriers that they have to go through to get to this message so we should just all be that grateful that that we happen to speak English and that's happen to be our first Lang we happen to be born in a english- speaking country where the message came English and that's why brother brandham says that America is going to get a a special you know punishment because we speak English the message came in English that we had an American prophet and and we have all this technology and all this all this access information and we just don't use it so we're going to get a special punishment if we don't grasp this word and really take hold of all the blessings that we've just been blessed with there's nothing of our own Merit we've just been born here and that's just it's it's incredible and we need to be thankful for that every day and I also want to talk about just uh something this trip made me really grateful for is the progress that the missionary field has made in in all the years because it's it's just you know when that scripture says that you know spread the gospel to the utmost parts of the earth you know and we go to this this this small little island where I mean there's one message Church on the entire island people have dirt houses you know they're washing clothes by hand they're washing everything by hand they're doing everything by hand there's no you they don't call a plumber they don't call a carpenter unless it's the guy around the around the street that they know that he works with wood but they they have so little and they're just so out of the way but the fact that we're able to get to them and minister to them and and fellowship with them it's it's it's truly a blessing so the the just the progress that the missionary field has made and my sister Nisa was saying they're all very friendly people even through the language area we're trying to understand them but they're very happy smiling up ready to talk to you it's incredible thing and and also the the progress of the missionary field is also my own personal testimony because you know a prophet one time went to Africa to do some some missionary work and that missionary work spread all the way to Zimbabwe where my method as grandfather had a a firstborn daughter who could then meet someone who was in the message and then comes me who I can also be bornn to the message and born you know under under the right atmosphere to receive the message as well so that's just the progress of that and how how much it spread and that's why that's why we're called to spread the gospel we're called to you know whoever we run into we need to need to try and get that word out and that's how we're going to that's how we're going to get out of here is making sure every every child every every person of God gets that new birth gets that experience climb the statue of perfect man comes to Perfection and then we can all leave so that's why we need to continue the missionary field so I'm very grateful for that and also just um just to know that you know we have brothers and sisters everywhere and that we all know each other you know by by the spirit you know even brother brandom said you can talk to someone and you can figure out that whether or not they're a Christian within five minutes so and just to be able to talk to people and even through the language barrier we can understand that they're you know Spirit-filled Christians Spirit fill Believers so it's good to know them so I think that fits well with the song I want to sing which is they will know we are Christians by our love we are one in the spirit we are one in the Lord we are one in the spirit we are one in the Lord and we pray that all Unity will one day be restored and they'll know we we are Christians by our love by our love yes they'll know we are Christians by our love we will walk with each other we will walk hand in hand we will walk with each other we will walk hand in hand and together we'll spread the news that God is is in our land they will know we are Christians by our love by our love they will know we are Christians by our love we will work with each other we will work side by side we will work with each other we will work side by side and we guard each man's dignity and save each man's Pride they will know we are Christians by our love by our love they will know we are Christians by our love all praise to the father from whom all things will come and all praise to Christ Jesus is one and and only son and all praise to the spirit who makes us all as one and they'll know we are Christians by our love by our love they will know we are Christians by our love we are one in the spirit we are one in the Lord we are one in the spirit we are one in the Lord and we pray that all Unity will one day be restored and they'll know we are Christians by our love by our love they will know we are Christians by our love amenit you hang on good job let's give them another hand we appreciate each and every one of you coming we appreciate the time that you've come that you've given to come today and listen to our to our brother Po's heart out uh if you have anybody have anything as special or or anything else they want to want to sing before we get started cuz we're going to let brother Daryl out we're going to cut him loose and let him just preach his heart out yes sir yes ma'am I sure would love for you to come and sing I knew they were somebody yes ma'am you come on we got plenty of time I'll play the base while I'm back there God bless you all amen well the other day um the girls out my husband being gone we had our little bible time together and there's this song that I sing at my old church where I got saved at um many years ago and I saying it to the girls I said this is my testimony and I want to get emotional cu iist um testimony meant a lot to me and I know God's love is real and salvation is real and he really did save me I mean I was a real sinner I'm just being honest I dressed bad I talk bad I cussed I did everything you know I didn't do drugs and stuff like that but I was out there you know dressing bad was dressing good to me you know I didn't know any better I cut all my hair off you know if you saw somebody like well she's unsavable you know one time John his daddy had us to go down to um to make in Georgia to deliver some money for his dad for somebody down there for a job or some pick up some money and we went down there and these Christian folks took us out to eat they were so kind to me I didn't know there were message Believers or anything just took us out got some ribs and everything just treated us so good and I had my pants on I was just you know just worldly but they were so sweet to me I didn't know what was different about them but now they're message Believers maybe they prayed for me so I'm just grateful for their kindness so you never know who you're meeting like how they look or don't judge people how they look don't judge a book by its cover you don't know like what's in their heart you know I know in my heart like I always want to be clean and that's what draw me to this message it's like we went to like some kind of little fake church I just call it that before we end up com to the message he was raising the message and I came to and I just couldn't hear it they're like we need to dress better I was look like what these other girls dressing bad I'm going to continue and how I need to dress but when I heard the true word of the message like I knew that this was a true salvation for a woman to wear a dress like you know like the 100% way like not 60% not 40% not 10% and I want to encourage every sister and brother to keep your Purity if there's one thing I cry out for keep your Purity it's worth so much it's so beautiful for a young man and young woman to keep themselves in the Lord and say bathe and clean in his presence I'm speaking as a mother I'm not speaking as a teen now I'm speaking as an older mother now big children 20 year old almost 17 year old in a few weeks and a 14 year old I beseech you all keep holding on with the go with with the Lord Keep Keep Holding On like it will be hard you know I want to lie to y'all it will be hard but y'all keep holding on y'all are so beautiful and precious in His sight right you guys are gems you guys are diamonds I tell my girls I beg them I only have a path I had so I testified all I'm not ashamed he is the one that cleansed me he is the one that gave me this life he's the one that gave me a family he's the one that gave me a god beli God-fearing husband it's only by his grace there is nothing good in me and so I just want to encourage each sh you and this song is a song I sang I don't know how we're going to get it I don't know how my voice will be but I want to sing it for his glory because it meant a lot to me years ago and it still means a lot to me now can see I would love to tell you what I think of Jesus since I found in him a friend so strong and true I would love to tell you how I changed my life completely he did something that no other friend could [Music] do no one ever cared for me like Jesus there's no other friend so kind as he no one else could take the sin and darkness from me oh how much he car for me all my life was full of sin when Jesus found me that was the truth y'all a misery and W Jesus place his Loving Arms All Around Me Lord help me and he me in the way I ought to [Music] go no one ever cared for me like Jesus there's no other friend so kind as he no one else has take the sin and darkness from [Music] me oh how much he cared for me every day he comes to me with new Assurance more and more I understand his words of Love Yes Lord but I'll never know just why he came to save me till some I see his face Lord this is the truth y'all I want my girls to know him I want my children to know him and who to truth he saved me I don't want them to go through all the trials there's no need there just no need and what they're suffering there no need it will cost you it will cost you you'll pay in some way so I just beseech you all just to press on with him that's no one ever cared for me like Jesus there's no other friend so kind as he no one El could take the sin and darkness from [Music] me oh how much he cared for me but you know it was even better when she stuck her testimony into that when you plug yourself into these songs is what they don't just write them and fill up paper it's got to mean something and when they got the inspiration to write it God was telling that writer to put it on paper so that sister Alicia can sing it today that's the way I see the thing the the inspiration I SW I like specials cuz it comes from your heart not everybody's singing it comes from your heart it's a special God put on your heart to sing to the people well that thought was before the foundation of the world we think all every we always think brother John well the preacher the preaching preaching is number one we know that but thank God for inspired songwriters like we were talking about John and Charles Wesley Charles Wesley you know John Wesley was a messenger to the church age but Charles Wesley wrote 6,000 songs right and they weren't Boogie wogie for those of you that know what Boogie wogie is that's rock music and all that other stuff no he wrote 6,000 songs that you and I can connect to God with amen through song that's why David the psalmist David was a man after God's Own Heart because he sang and those evil spirits just go away from you'll try that sometime have a bad have a bad day start singing don't sing what you heard on the on the Walmart um no not on the Walmart speakers seeing what God gives you in your heart amen well let's let's have a different type of worship now let's let's listen to the word of the Lord as brother Daryl Ward from Johnson City Tennessee it's not Happy Valley Church anymore it's the Word of Life Church so they're changing he said they're going to have their first service next Sunday and um then they're going to have an open house Wednesday in the church service next Sunday and then several months maybe in April they going to have a u a dedication service so I'd like for to go to that and and see the new church it's it's beautiful from the outside I'd like to see it from the inside so just beautiful group of people another set of the bride and brother Dale's been here before so he's he's uh comfortable and and I hope he just takes his Liberty today thank you again for all the young uh people coming and coming from different churches we appreciate that and we thank you so very much and one more time brother Louise and Sister Christine and brother Bob they put their heart's work into almost two weeks of of of grueling uh you know riding in the back of a truck and and I don't forget y'all but them them the adults you got you got y'all okay with the adults you got to you got to kind of Pat them a little bit you know you got to stroke their ego just a little bit is this on I'm sorry but I want to give them one more hand amen what brother Joe Green say if you can't go what send somebody and we appreciate you digging in your pocket and helping these young adults and and them go and and uh we pray that God will give them fruit for their labor and if they don't know it now they surely will see it on the other side and and and never will anybody go preach the message of the hour and it just return void it's going to accomplish and it's going to help somebody if no more than helping these as they come back doesn't it feel when you when you come back you know you you you really just condemn that Bunch just like you did right yeah y'all ought to be singing like these people sing y' 12 specials of service just be careful we're still human beings we're still Americans so you have that Zeal you know went to Jamaica every how many times 11 times and you come back and you're like Bo these people are dead but no they're Christians and it's just different worship so you

get something to drink and I was standing there next to the Tater chips and this guy comes walking in he must have been a local and the lady behind the cash register she she looked at him when she comes in she does a double take goes what John you've changed your mask and when she when she said that I about shouted past the Tater chips CU I just called a revel thought that's exactly right he's

in a time when nobody knows what to believe no more CNN says Fox is wrong fox says CNN's lying and oh my but I'm so glad that we don't have Fox News but we got the good news amen and we can look in the back of the book and we find out we win we win amen we need to fight with that Revelation that we win is that right yes sir you know when I was in the Army many many year ago I was up at Fort Brag with the 18th Airborne Corps up there Airborne artillery and it gave me a a Ste pot they gave me an M16 rifle they gave me a m203 grenade launcher that was mounted under underneath my 16 they gave me combat boots they gave me a backpack they gave me all this stuff to fight with but they never gave me a promise that I would win no they didn't they said go in there you know good luck but in God's Army he gave us the helmet of salvation amen he shot our feet with the preparation of the gospel and he gave us the promise we win yes he did praise the lord well if you have your BBL this even turn with us to the book of Matthews I want to read from Matthews chapter 27 starting at verse 15 we greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus and I was supposed to be in the nicara Nicaragua meetings myself this year but my wife was in an automobile accident and total the car and she suffered a concussion and some some back injury and I I just I just couldn't leave My Little Queen so uh so we uh canceled and didn't go but I heard the meetings was really good and we're just just grateful for those that were able to go and if you've never been there it is a humbling experience uh just precious precious people you know brother said about the Spanish people said they get their healing because they're willing to eat the crumbs and just just a real humble people that that would have been my 15th trip I think there to Nicaragua but I've been there with brother Luis before just really good people there and I'm sorry we couldn't get to go but I've certainly heard some good reports from the meeting so we're thankful for that I want to read now from Matthew chapter 27 starting at vers verse 15 and I know I spit a little bit when I preached but I didn't realize I spit that bad everybody's sitting towards the back so I'll try to watch it y'all move a little bit closer in the morning and I'll try to watch it no just kidding just kidding Matthew 27 starting at 15 do you love him amen the Bible says this now at the feast the governor was want to release unto the people a prisoner whom they would and they had then an mble prisoner called barabus and therefore when they were gathered together pilate said unto them whom will ye that I release unto you barabus or Jesus which is called Christ for he knew that for Envy they had delivered him and when he was sat down on the Judgment seat his wife sent to him saying how thou nothing to do with this just man for I've suffered many things this day in a dream because of him but the chief priests and the elders pursu persuaded the multitude be careful who persuades you the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask barabus and Destroy Jesus and the governor answered and said unto them whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you and they said barabus and pilate said unto them what shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ and they all said unto him let him be crucified and the governor said why what evil hath he done but they cried out the more saying let him be crucified and when pilate saw that he could Prevail nothing but rather a tumet was made and he took water and washed his hands before the multitude saying I am innocent of the blood of this just person but you see the prophet Tau us the only way to get his blood off of your hands is to receive it into your heart I'm innocent of the blood of this just person see ye to it then answered all the people and said his blood be on us and on our children then released he barabus unto them and when he had scourged Jesus he delivered him to be crucified let us bow our heads I want to speak to you for a few minutes this evening on release the prisoner Heavenly Father Lord as we bow our heads before you we are so grateful dear God for your word and Lord that it's not just letter only but there's a life behind the word and Lord that your word can still speak to our hearts Lord and change the amen condition of people's lives and Lord I pray this afternoon as we've gathered here Lord with these young people father may be something be said that would encourage them Lord to look to see Lord that a way of Escape has been provided for David said unto our God belongs the issue from death and that word means the Escape you are the Escape Route Lord the exit door out of here we are so grateful Lord in such a Troublesome time when men's hearts are continually evil yeah Lord your word will prevail and I pray dear Lord may you receive honor and Glory un yourself father God if this whole Gathering to this weekend would be for the sake of one soul may your word touch that Soul this day I pray heal our sick Lord and encourage those that are discouraged set the prisoner free grant it Lord for we ask these things in Jesus name and the bride says amen God bless you you may be seated amen as our scriptures open this afternoon we find ourself in a Roman prison house now come with me for just a few minutes in your mind right let's take this little trip back to this Roman prison and as we make our way down the hall of this pest House of a prison we come to realize that we are making our way down death row that these are the cells of the prisoners of Rome who have been sentenced to death for their crimes against Rome right can you can you imagine the smell the the unsanitary conditions and the the the the rats and no good food and no good water because after all these men are condemned to death so there's no use to try to preserve their life when they've been condemned to die but let me say this afternoon that every person born on this Earth was born under a sentence of death we were if you will we were born on death row for David said behold I was shaped in iniquity and did and in sin did my mother conceive me from the moment that we were conceived we are on our path to death you know many people today they have this idea I don't need nobody I don't need no friends I I I don't need no help I'm doing all right by myself I'm I'm smart and and I I I I've got money and I can figure it out and I I can make my own way but you see the prophet of God said you were born defeated right and that birth can never bring you to life that's right people strive so hard to be famous or to be popular or to be a movie star but nine times out of 10 most of those people end up with their lives destroyed right Katie Spade that people spends thousands of dollars to buy a Katie Spade purse what did Katie Spade do hang herself in a hotel room oh my Robin Williams a comedian that made everybody laugh and everybody what did he do hung your in a hotel room right because we're born defeated and there's nothing that we can ever do within oursel that would ever bring us to life the prophet said you're in a defeated World amongst defeated people amongst defeated Creeds and defeated denomination but you've got to come to Victory somehow and before there can ever be a victory there must be a Victor but you see man was not born that way man was meant to be born free but now we find them that these men here on death row that they have been sentenced to die by crucifixion one of the most horrible forms of death that there were oh friends it's terrible what sin can do to you you know brother R talked about an eagle that was in a cage and they said that eagle had just been captured and it was one of the most pitiful SS that I ever had the privilege of seeing he said that great Heavenly bird had been captured and netted by someone and thrown into a cage and that poor fellow was so out of place that he would jump with all with there was within him against those big bars flopping his wings only to find himself to fall back on his back and he said then that poor Eagle had beat himself against those bars until all his feathers was beat off from his wings and his head and his face was bruised and he said I watched him again proudly walked back and with all that was in him he poured himself against the bars only to find himself knocked backwards again right but he said that eagle he wouldn't quit because he was out of place he didn't belong there right he wanted to be free he was born to be free there was something in him that told him this ain't who you really are oh my SS of God let me say this afternoon I'm not going to quit if I get knocked down I'm going to get back up if I fail I'm going to ask forgiveness but I'm not going to quit because I don't belong here I come from somewhere else amen I come from God I must go back to God Prophet said as he laid there on that floor and those weary eyes soared the skies he said I thought what a pitiful sight made not to be on the earth here he's a Heavenly bird his whole makeup was to live in the blue way above the honks and the cares of this world but to see a bird like that that was made up borned into Earth to soar the skies right yet caged in such a way that he could never soar the skies again oh my a prisoner in a manmade cage a prisoner and the prophet said as he laid there looking at that place where he had been made born the sore he would not give up because something inside of him kept telling him I don't belong here right and maybe you're sitting here this afternoon you're singing the songs and you the song service and you was a part of of it and singing the songs and you're looking at a place and something in your heart is telling you this is where you belong this is where you belong maybe you've never surrendered to God in your life and maybe you've just been but something you keep hearing the songs and the testimonies and the sister she poured out her heart and something keeps telling you this is where I belong this is what I'm missing in my life and that ego you know he thought this this is not where I belong this is not what I was born to be but by the cun of man this Eagle had been CED for life and the prophet said what a pitiful sight it is but I tell you something friends something more pitiful than that is to see men and women who were born and shaped in the image of God to be Sons and Daughters of God to be find them caged by sin and habits and the cares of this world I'm not talking about just the ones out there in the barroom I'm talking about the ones that set Among Us on message fuse and yet they're still caged it's far more pitiful than that eagle man was not made to be bound man is a free man whom the son ha made free is free indeed man doesn't have to be bound like that oh my the different things that cages men and deny them of their god-given privileges manmade manmade in the image of his God he doesn't have to be a he doesn't have to be bound a slave to Satan he wasn't made to be a slave he was made to be a Son of God God made man in his own image amen as we move down this Hall we come to sell number five this cell belongs to the most feared probably the meanest man in the region his name is barabus he actually his name is Jesus barabus right which means barabus means son of the father this man was a murderer he was a thief he was a credible but all of his meanness and his evilness had caught up with him and now he was going to pay the price and let me say young people you may think you're getting away with it you may think that what you're doing that nobody knows that you're doing it but I want you to understand this afternoon there is an allseeing eye watching every every one of us and there is a payday that's coming for be assured if we s it we will also so reap it amen this man barabus who had brought such fear upon the people when you mentioned his name people were scared to death of the name of barabus yes but this man who had brought such fear and such distress now he was feeling it himself all right the the prophet said all night long he walked up and down that jail pulling his hair for the next morning he would go to a cross capital punishment he would die and how the nightmares passed over him that night and how he couldn't rest knowing the agony and the pain that he would soon face death by crucifixion you see where sin had brought him to that's what sin had brought him to oh he thought he's having him a big time when he was doing it yeah yeah reaping the benefits of his evilness but now it had all caught up to him and the one who had brought such fear was now experiencing fear himself you know I was in mam Morris Mexico a sister there had a young boy raised in a message church but he wanted to be a part of this cartel so he left the Message Church to follow this this idea of being a gangster but all this gangster caught up with him yeah because the boy disappeared and his mother sought and S and sought to find out what happened to her son who went to a message Church his grandfather was the pastor of the church and finally she got word from the cartel do not look for your son there is nobody for we B we we put him in a barrel of acid yeah and this there is nobody because she asked him if he would just give me my son's body that I could bury him and finally after all these months of wailing and they sent word do not look for your son

you you send away your day of Grace what is it Satan holding God's children in bondage held down locked up to it seems like there's no way out just like barabus here he is now held in a Roman prison pacing the floor knowing the prophet said that in the next morning no breakfast or nothing knowing that his blood would be strung out like a among the wolves and all that was here's chains rattling the prophet said trampling of the soldiers Here Comes four or five maybe Battalion of Romans soldiers and Spears glit walking up there and that big Jailer turns the key says baratus walk out so you think he felt that morning when you heard the Romans coming with those big Galleries and the Big Iron shoes are stopping alone chains are outling Spears dragging on the street to know he's going to be killed when he opened up the doors barab is trembling and cried ready to run saying this is the end of me and now we see him are you still with me and now you see him we see here Jesus we see pilate Jesus is on the right hand bar RAB is on Pilot's left standing before the people knowing that the Jews would release one right pilate says who do you want on one hand was barabus a thief a murderer a liar evil in his flesh he wasn't accused of this that's who he actually was he wasn't falsely accused he was guilty he knew he was guilty amen and on the other hand was Jesus the son of God the Holy One the Messiah am one who done nothing but evil and one who done nothing but good healed the sick raised the dead there was no comparison and the crowd Cries Out us give us barabus what shall I do what Jesus called the Christ crucify him they were crying for his blood but little did they know that's exactly what they needed they didn't realize it maybe you failed to realize the thing you need the thing you need to make your life complete is in this building right [Applause] now release the prisoner release the prisoner release barabus amen give us barabus and Jesus stood there oh I can see it in my mind Jesus stood there silently for he knew the will of the father he knew the father's will he said father let them have Barabas for Jesus knew oh God as our sister s there is no friend like the lovely Jesus he stood there silent his father give them bar rabus because he knew right the father would have to treat Jesus like barabus so he could treat barabus like Jesus oh God he became me that I might become him by Grace you see Barabas thought it was the people that made him free he thought it was the will of the people that set him free and let me say this nation is built upon liberty and justice for all and in their desire to be free they are more bound than ever listen to me there is no law there is no law made by man that'll ever make us free amen no no BR no it wasn't the people that set you free it was the love of God that set him free for you see Jesus was the very Heart Of God expressed you see when I look at this story as I pondered in and was was was writing something of these notes out and was looking at this I come to realize who barabus son of the father who that really is it's me it's you it's us while we were yet sinners Christ died for [Music] us I should have stood there on that platform in my sins and my guilt in my failures a condemned prisoner Chained and Shackled by Satan caught up in his we Guilty by birth but Jesus said take me take me let Daryl go let Wade go thank you Lord son of the father son of the father let him go let the prisoner go and the Bible says they took him Jesus they took him to Calvary and There They Crucified him and in his dying M minutes his life leaving his body and the pain was so great he cried out Eli my God my God why has Thou forsaken me he pushed up on the cross and he cried with a loud voice it is finished down in hell I could just say oh you got him boss you got him ain't nobody die like that I couldn't have been him I'm telling you with go my you're Victorious you've stopped him you got him boss all it was he heard am sir Satan says to one of the Demons open the door and see who that is and the demon said at your house you open the door that's right he goes to the door come on now he opened the door there stood Jesus amen well I see you finally arrived welcome oh he didn't want him down there right look what a bluff he is well I've been no you don't want no part of him no right Jesus said yes I've arrived I've arrived for one purpose you put fear and chills over the people long enough but I've come down to take over amen I am the Virgin born son of God Satan said I've got a right Adam sinned but Jesus said my blood is still wet on the cross and that paid the price for the sin yes sir and I've come to take over give me the keys to death in heav oh Hallelujah he slapped him threw him back in there get back there where you belong rip the keys off of his side oh my said my blood has been shed for the remission of sins and for their sickness and you can't keep them any longer there will be a people who will believe me and you can't bind them any longer with sickness you can't bind them with fear for they will believe me Hallelujah for I have the keys of death and hell oh my but unto every one of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ for four he sayith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto man at that moment friends let me listen to me every prison door every chain door every prison house begin to burst open every cell block that Satan had to launch and to bind Humanity Christ opened up the prison house and said release the prisoners and I say to you this afternoon if you can receive what he did for you you are pardoned amen and your prison house has been opened I wonder if we could see what Barabas saw someone taking our place he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for iniquity the chastisements of Peace was upon him and with his stripes I was healed amen we the guilty ones who should be sick can you see him as your deliverer you who should go to hell you see him in your freedom your P to Heaven I wonder if you could see what Barabas saw on that day what did he see someone taking his place they say friend if you are in a prison House of Satan I don't care what you've done if you're ready if you'll take the step this evening you are free Christ has liberated the prison house you say I'm lost as a coin and a sandp pal but you don't have to be the prophet said there's someone standing present right now oh my there is someone standing present right now that'll

been through the nstep program three different times she said I cannot stop drinking she said I'll go for a while and then I fall right back into it I've got a young child I don't even know who the father is cuz I was drunk yeah and I said you know what I'd do if I was you sis I would lay that alcohol at the altar and I would take my freedom in Christ you lay it down and accept what he did for you amen and I begin to pray for that young girl I'll never forget it she begin to scream to the top of her lungs I'm free I'm free I'm free Hallelujah and I was up there just the other night not long ago and she came up to me and she said brother Daryl I've been sober for 2 years why because whom the son hath made free is free indeed if he can do that in Alaska he can do that in Lula Georgia this afternoon whatever it is whether it's sickness fear oppression depression you can go free he's open the prison house amen and you this afternoon I don't care if you're eight or 80 you can go free right amen you can go free or you can close the door stay in your cell that pestil and that coldness of fear isolation or you can go free amen yeah the door has been open well if he would only do it he's already done it you just have to receive it yes sir you know I was eating in a restaurant the other day I'm I'm closing I was in a restaurant the other day the waitress come up to me and said with my family said is there anything else you want I said no ma'am that's that's fine I said if you'll just bring the check she said your check has been took care of I said excuse me she said somebody saw you in here and they wanted to buy your meal said I said well let me give you she said the tip they even gave me a tip oh man now I could have done one or two things I could have argued with her are you sure it's me maybe it's that table over there you're talking about her yeah I didn't see nobody in here that that knew me you are you sure it's me are you sure maybe I better go ahead and pay it because I go out that door and you'll you'll say I tried to steal a meal yeah yeah I could have sat there and argued just like some of you argue with him or I could have received what was done for me and walk out with a free meal you can receive what he's done for you and walk out with a free meal amen and that pizza will taste a whole lot better when the chains of your enemy that's right is off of you to be Unshackled I wonder if we can see what Barabas saw someone taking our place yeah thank you Lord think about it can we come this afternoon on the basis of what Christ done for me yeah just do like that young girl give him your shame give him your pain give him your weakness give him your sin give him your habit give him your fear give him your depression just give it to him and walk away free for he said release the prisoner let the son of the father go free thank you Lord he took our place yes he he went from the cross to the Grave from the grave to the sky and he said where I am there shall you be also the prison doors are open friends you can step out this afternoon you see Jesus was the conduit he was the channel that brought the son back to the father right do you love him let us bow his oh heavenly father thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord what a friend we have in Jesus when no one could help me when I couldn't even help myself you done for me what no other could do oh God maybe Satan's been lying to some of these young people maybe they've been coming to this church just sitting on the Pew they feel like they don't fit in they don't belong because Satan has told them it's not for you you're not one of them or maybe they've looked at some of the lies that's been posted on the internet and it's confused their minds Satan trying to lock them up in a prison House of confusion or whatever it would be Lord we spoke of many different things but maybe something here that someone's dealing with that wasn't spoke but Lord may they realize even though it wasn't spoke they can still go free from that Lord For Whom the son is made free is free indeed oh Father may we realize May each of us realize Lord barabus it's me amen son of the father and oh God I pray this afternoon if there be one Lord who could step out free and these meetings have not been in vain Lord God you see the needs of your people the congregation decides Lord no doubt there's many needs some sick Lord some battling different things cancers Lord whatever it would be I I I don't know Lord but you know every person here and I pray in the name of Jesus by the same anoing that raised my Lord from the grave may it move upon each heart and upon each home Lord granted this afternoon I pray father God in Jesus name whatever heads bowed just a moment not to point you out friend I would never do that but if you're here and you believe that God sent this message for you and maybe you're dealing with things your parents don't even know your brothers and sisters don't know your husband your wife nobody knows but you but this message just spoke to you and you believe the report you know I I don't know what Barabas done I I've I've looked at different places I've never really found out what baraba has done with this freedom but I want to ask you this afternoon what are you going to do with your freedom that's already been given to you you will accept it or will you close the prison door and stay because you see anytime you come to a service the prophet said you'll either be better or worse off and I say to you don't leave worse the prison door is open if he done it up there in Alaska for that young girl Lord he can do it here in Lula Georgia for you and if you're here I just wonder if you would just slip up to your feet and say would you remember me brother Daryl ah friend I don't need to know he knows he already knows would you say I going to accept my freedom today I'm Satan's been lying to me but I ain't going to take that lie no more I'm going to stand on the promise of the word would there be one would there be one amen look what he gave you look at the freedom he gave you now why don't you give him your shame why don't you give him your fear would don't you give him that besetting sin and step out free would there be anyone Hallelujah I give myself away I give myself away so you will use me I give myself away I give myself away so you would use me here I am here I stand Lord my life is in your hands Lord I'm longing to see let's stand your desire reveal in me I give myself I give away so you can use

about he wasn't preaching about himself he was preaching about God I was thinking while was ministering you know I read you that quote not too long ago where brother R said sister Alicia was talking about holding yourself that's why that's why your virginity that's why you're that's why it's so important because you take it over to the spiritual part and and listen but there comes one time remember I read the quote brother R said you've held yourself all your life all your life you've held yourself you fought off them Devils called boys you fought off all the things to stay pure but there's one day you got to give up what you've been saving all your life when you give it all to your husband what a special thing so now let's take it over to the spiritual part we've had demons beat on us we've had Devils all over us and we've tried our best to stay the Virgin bride of Jesus Christ but one day folks we got to give it we got to surrender everything we are to our husband he'll never do us wrong he'll never divorce US amen we're the bride we're the reason that he came back on the day of Pentecost was to get a bride ready but have we surrendered all have we went ahead and said Okay God you're my husband I'm giving you everything I got everything I got that's why the song I surrender all that's good but if you're not raising your hand you ain't surrendering that's universal sign of surrender Universal all over the world when you throw both hands up like this you've surrendered now what I tell you if you put one hand behind your back and you surrender like this no you might get shot cuz you can use this hand to get whatever gun knife whatever but when you got both hands up in the air there's nothing you can do amen so that's what we're going to do today we're going to give our all like that sign says back there and that brother Daryl preached that sermon years ago about giving our All to Jesus Christ and that's s on that door back there as you walk in he's talking about the football team you know saying that we give today we give all the Tennessee football he had been down there and looked in the stadium and they hit it they hit the uh door every time they go out have you give your all today if they can do it out in the world and act crazy jump up and down shout and scream for their favorite team I think we ought to do the same thing for our favorite team amen team Jesus amen team Jesus will never he'll never lose yeah you ain't got to look for the score it's already done he won at Calvary but thank God there was a barabus that's right cuz it proved proved who Jesus was right it proved who Jesus was it proved that somebody had to take my place so that I could go free Hey listen the crowd they hated Jesus they going to hate you they wanted barab us they wanted a thief and a liar that's what's the same thing in the world all you young people they love you out there why they love you out there because you just like them but when you make a stand for God when you surrender yourself to him you become real odd to the world because the the world will surrender their s to drugs alcohol all the different things of the world but if you surrender today you surrender all to Jesus Christ you'll never lose and he said I'll never leave you he said I never forsake Him we've had a good time just getting started everything it's

the king amen I was I want to tell you a little something before we before we dismiss it was I was uh watching online somebody wasn't even a message preacher good grief brother Daryl's laughing laughing in there but you know I always wondered why the prodical son's father ran ran to him the Bible tells us when he sees when he sees the when he sees his son he runs to him you know why now that's not in the Bible but Jewish tradition tells us or told that person they had done some study the reason the father had to run to the gates of the city to get the sun before the sun entered into the into the city was that under Jewish tradition if you got an inheritance and you wasted it on Gentile righteous living you know he went out he he got rid of all his money and he bought and sold and got all kind of stuff and got in a bad way but you couldn't come back in the city that stone you so the Father the father knew that and before the devil the people of the cuz see if he to let that guy walk on in he let his son walk on him doesn't matter son or not they could have stoned him they could have killed him but he went out remember put the cat around him he said welcome home in other words I'm going to take your shame and I'm going to bring you back into where you're supposed to be well praise God if that didn't if that didn't help you it sure helped me amen I always wondered why he ran out sure you know you're happy and but why couldn't the guy you know the son come no he had to go get him right he had to go protect him as we were talking as brother Daryl was talking about Jesus looked over and he said in his in his mind he said barabus I got to die for you I'm going to die for you this day I'm going to die I'm going to take your place right and if he would accepted Jesus Christ you know what he would have been a Christian but he didn't we know what happened or we don't know what happened but he never was recorded anymore but we sure appreciate all of you coming
