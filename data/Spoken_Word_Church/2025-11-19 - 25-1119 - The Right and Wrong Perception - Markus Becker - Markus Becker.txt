Honor of God and help families, brothers and sisters and children and people and hearts and souls distressed. Father, may you give up. Amen. I tell you if if if if you were there at the uh funeral service for my sister Sharon, I spoke about getting out of your comfort zone. Do something different. You know, share the experience. And I tell you, it's a blessing. God will work in your life. Um I've seen brother Dell do that many times. And um you know, we're here as a servant's heart and that's what we do. Love one another, love God's people, live for each other. And I tell you, there's a blessing and a gratitude in that. Amen. Let's um let's sing that song. He's the Lord of glory.

He he kills the sick, the lame, the hawk, makes the blind to see. He opens all the prison sets the captive free. Behold what manner of man it is. What manner of man is he? He's the Lord of glory.

Hallelujah. Oh, be it unto me according to your word, according to your promises. I can stand secure and carve upon my heart the truth that sets me free according to your word. Dear Lord, be it. Oh, let it be a prayer for this evening. Go and be it unto me accord unto your word. Accord unto your promises I can stand secure and guard upon my heart. The truth that sets me free accord unto your word. Dear Lord be it. Let's all stand as brother Aaron comes. Oh be it unto me. According to your word, according to your promises, I can sense your word and cover upon my heart the truth that set me free. Lord, enter your word, dear Lord, be it unto me. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many can say that tonight? Be it unto me according to thy word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Good to see each one of you tonight in the house of the Lord. And uh we just pray that Brother Wade and Brother Danny have a good time and the Lord blesses them while they're there. And uh good to have brother Marcus with us tonight. &gt;&gt; And we always appreciate brother Marcus coming and and being with us here. &gt;&gt; And like everybody said, we just love brother Marcus has a real heart and servant's heart. And I get to I don't remember what country it was, but he was there and he was preaching to the young people and then he had questions and answers. And uh he does questions and answers kind of like I do. They ask you questions, then you ask them questions. But it was really, really good and it just really blessed my heart and uh every time we've heard brother Mark his minister, he's always been just a blessing to us and we always appreciate him taking the time to come be with us and uh looking forward to what the Lord has for us tonight. Amen. So as brother Marcus comes tonight, let's sing. Word of God ever true. Changing me, changing words long reserved for our world. They resound with God's own heart. Oh, let the word of God in our words of life. Words of hope. Give us strength. It builds us home. In this word, wherever we roll, the word of God will guide us all. Word of God. True. We have come with heart for your word of God is far in holy words of our faith. Handed down to this day to us through sacrifice. The faithful words of Christ and holy words don't reserve for all in this world. Oh let the word of God. The word of God ever is changing me and changing you. We have come with open heart. Oh, let the word of God. &gt;&gt; Now, while the music is softly playing, let's bow our heads again. Heavenly Father, we thank you for these wonderful songs. May you speak to us this evening. May you especially encourage those who stand in their own way. Father, those who are giving up a little bit, Father, those who blame themsel and blame themselves. May you just encourage them, Father, to understand we have a father. We have a heavenly father and who takes care of us who is nearer when we forget ourself. Our father never forgets us. Father, may you bring it very dear and very close to our hearts this evening. Bless our most noble pastor Wade. Father, protect him on his trip. Father, bring him safe back home. Bless the church back home, Father. Bless the bride in the US, Father. And definitely, Father, may you bless Israel because those who bless Israel, they are blessed already, Father. So, we thank you for this time of fellowship. Ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. God bless you all. And I really thank the musician, Brother Joe. Thank you very much, my precious brothers. And while we're standing, let's open the word of the Lord &gt;&gt; in the book of Matthew. Matthew 25 15 the book of and it's the very known parable of the talents Matthew 25:15 he says and unto one he gave five talents to another two and to another one and please keep that sentence in your mind and to everyone every man according to his several ability and straight away took his journey and in verse 24 we see the reaction of one of those 254 and he which have received one talent came and said Lord I knew thee and that thou art a hard man reaping where thou hast not sown and gathering where thou hast not stra and I was afraid and went and hid thy talent in the earth. Lo, there thou hast that is thine. And let us read in the book of Revelation chapter 3 verse 17. Revelation 3:1 17. Because thou sayest, I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked and so on. May the Lord add his blessing to the reading of his word. We may be seated. And I think it's fine for you if I put off directly my jacket. &gt;&gt; I I Yeah. Now I I really greet you in the house of the Lord. It's a great honor for me to be here and uh I told brother we will be in the area because we have a another project that we are discussing and so he invited me for this evening and um that is always for me a great honor great respect. I still remember the the time of of the father brother Dale we we we we consider him to be a most noble gentleman. You know that is how we really keep the man in our hearts. A really a really of a father you know a really a really a gentleman and we wished we would have more people like this in this message you know that kind of a caliber that kind of behavior of attitude and and the same for our most brother Wade and if he's listening later to the table greet him very warmly in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. I bring greetings from our local church back in home in in in Germany and uh really we we feel really connected with you. It's it's it's a little bit for me feeling at home. In Germany we have a slogan which says feel at home but be don't behave like that. Okay. In other words, don't put the feet on the table and I will not do this. I'm a I'm a traveler myself and uh and if you travel you learn to respect people you know you learn to respect churches and so forth and and uh so that is exactly and and by the way we became a little bit older of really uh choosing our words right and um so I'm I'm really happy to be with you and uh I'm um yeah tomorrow very early I'm I'm leaving already um and so this will be a short time but really I thanks for for for my host, brother Luis, uh where I'm the family. God bless you all, brother Joe Canada, the whole dream team together. We had really a wonderful time and so really a pleasure. Thanks for the nice words of compliments. And if if if you wouldn't mind, I'd enter directly into a subject. Yeah, because I'm I I I I I I'm not a long preacher, but I need I have to my time to really uh uh develop a little subject and I know it's a Wednesday and so I'm directly entering into into the subject and I would like to entire I have no notes but as usually I always have some some pictures and some quotes and that gives me always a certain uh red red line to follow. Okay. And I would love to to now to to deal with that subject according to the understanding of the message. Now, brother Brandon makes a certain quote. He says, "The Bible has become a new book." And I remember that that uh that when I was young, we had in in German classes, we had to do analysis of uh German poetry. Okay? uh you would take for example a a a a a book of Shakespeare for example it's not German but English okay and then the question is what was the intention of the writer and and I want to want to be honest with you I did not understand anything any I have always bad marks yeah and and one time I thought why don't you ask the writer yourself I didn't write that thing you know was got a bit nervous and when my daughter was in school uh one night I couldn't sleep and And I and I and I found a novel exactly the same novel that she went through that I went through when I was a child now 30 years later and when I read that novel it became everything became clear it was it was it was obvious things that I didn't understand and so I understood the book was the same but the reader changed. Do you understand when brother said this Bible has become a new book? It's the same book, but the ones who read it, they read it now different. &gt;&gt; Because this is the time of maturity. &gt;&gt; We are not babies anymore. &gt;&gt; I mean, God will not rapture a a teenager &gt;&gt; or a baby. God will rapture uh people who came into a certain maturity. So therefore I repeat what I always say this the message that we believe does not come from America. &gt;&gt; It comes from the presence of God. &gt;&gt; It's not an American message. &gt;&gt; It's not brother Brandham's message. &gt;&gt; It's God's message. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was just a voice. &gt;&gt; The message that we believe is not a cult. Right. &gt;&gt; Why should I become cultish? &gt;&gt; The message that we believe is not a a sect. Why should I become sectarian? &gt;&gt; The message that we believe is not a denomination. Why should I become denominational? What's the point? &gt;&gt; You said, brother Marcus, what is the message of the hour? It's our father talking to us. &gt;&gt; The message is for the bride, &gt;&gt; for a special class of people. Brother calls them with prophetic insight. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we read the Bible today through the message of the hour and things become clearer and I hope I could clarify uh that that that that that parable according to the message and it helps us a lot. Okay. So I would like to call that sermon for today uh uh the right perception &gt;&gt; and the wrong perception. &gt;&gt; It will determine our actions. So you understand that uh that God speaks to Laudia and general to the church world in Laia and God tells the church world look you have a problem you're sick &gt;&gt; because your self-perception is that you don't need nothing &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; but if you only would know you need a heart &gt;&gt; we need the message of the hour now in my work I changed my work I'm since a couple of years I'm working in the integration integration of refugees I have to integrate them in German courses in uh learning the language and I'm taking care in our community what we call dysfunctional families &gt;&gt; and brother that the sign of a person who is sick, mentally sick, is that she ha he has the wrong perception of himself. &gt;&gt; A person who is mentally sick sick thinks that he is healthy. &gt;&gt; Therefore, you cannot help the person. You only can help a person when he understands I need help. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God tells this to a whole church what he said. You think you have everything &gt;&gt; and you don't know &gt;&gt; that you need the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the self-perception, how we see our yourself and how we see God is so important. It will determine how you read the Bible. I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm dealing with a person uh in that integration and there my colleague, she's an unbeliever and she has in her district she has people that uh come from a Christian church uh mostly Ukrainians, Pentecostals or Baptists but very strong in their church. And she says, "Is Christianity helpful for a healthy uh let me say upbringing of people or upbringing of children or uh socializing people." I said everything depends on the picture of God that that church is painting. If you're painting a God who is always angry with us, who is never satisfied. In other words, whatever you do, you always feel wrong. &gt;&gt; You always feel it was not enough. &gt;&gt; You you and you have a picture of the Lord Jesus that he's standing there and he's hoping that you don't make the rapture. &gt;&gt; Then that religion is nothing else than toxic. Right? &gt;&gt; It is the reason how why people were so hard with and so strict with their children because they had that kind of a of a godly picture. But if you see God as a father, &gt;&gt; a one who loves you, &gt;&gt; the one who cares for you, the one who he he helps you to make the rapture, then you can sing the song, what a friend &gt;&gt; I have in Jesus. &gt;&gt; It depends on the perception of yourself and the perception of God. It can't be toxic &gt;&gt; or we can &gt;&gt; the the the I want to say this in all these years we didn't become more worldly. We kept our standard &gt;&gt; but we now observed what was religion and what was true revelation of God. When we were younger, I remember we want to be more holy than brother Brandham himself and we are not more worldly. But today, the older you get, the more you understand you cannot do anything without God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Salvation even our children is not our business. &gt;&gt; God is the savior. &gt;&gt; No, we can only make a framework. Right? &gt;&gt; So, we talked this evening and it's so dear to my heart because look, if you deal with people, you must have an empathy for them. &gt;&gt; And I have a church of these refugees. They are all Muslims. &gt;&gt; I always call them, it's my church, but none of them has the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; because no Muslim has the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; But remember this, these people have a soul. Amen. &gt;&gt; They have feelings. &gt;&gt; They are not sawdust. &gt;&gt; They're not just animals. They're not robots. &gt;&gt; They have a soul. &gt;&gt; They have a dignity in life. And brother Bam said, "Life is precious in the eyes of God." &gt;&gt; You're never wrong in respecting people. You're never wrong. Never. Bride is bright. &gt;&gt; But the rest is not nothing. They're people. &gt;&gt; That's right. If you see a a bump in the on the street, for us it's just a vagabond. It's just a bump. But never forget. I mean, for for his mama, that's her son. &gt;&gt; And maybe that man is the father of a little daughter. &gt;&gt; Amen. Life is precious in the eyes of God. You're never wrong in respecting people. &gt;&gt; Never wrong in helping, giving a helping hand. &gt;&gt; I remember when we were younger, we were so revelated, we couldn't even shake hands to somebody else. Amen. But the older we get, the more normal we become. &gt;&gt; He said because revelation comes from God. &gt;&gt; It was not our merit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so the second thing that I want to say this is is when we preach the message, we don't talk to colors. &gt;&gt; We talk to theophanes &gt;&gt; to the inner man. &gt;&gt; So, so there's no need to have an inferior complex or a superior complex. &gt;&gt; We don't talk to colors. We talk to the inner man &gt;&gt; and there's a connection between the soul and the theophony. &gt;&gt; Amen. Definitely. So, so, so to make that thing on on on on the right thing. &gt;&gt; Now, please this afternoon uh this evening we make it must make an extinction. There's a difference when a person cannot and when a person will not. So what we heard when brother Brandon spoke about the judgment so forth that's for people who have received truth but they don't want. &gt;&gt; But there's a lot of people they want but they cannot. &gt;&gt; That's a difference. &gt;&gt; There's a difference between do not want or do he cannot. &gt;&gt; There's many people in the message they stand in their own way. &gt;&gt; They're good people. Sometime they leave even the church. Don't throw something behind them. If they are in the hands of God, God doesn't forget them. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you consecrated your children to the Lord, believe your own practice that you did. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because when we gave these children to the Lord, the babies, we told God, "Our hands one day will become too short." But your hands will never become too short. &gt;&gt; Believe your own prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Definitely. So, so we are not talking about people this evening who will not but who cannot. &gt;&gt; There's times in your life where you don't need a doctrine. You need a father. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not sufficient. We have some brother Brandon pictures at our wall. We need a reality. &gt;&gt; Amen. When when when when when when everything goes wrong in my life, I need a friend &gt;&gt; and my friend is my savior &gt;&gt; and my father is my bridegroom and my judge is my attorney. Amen. And my king is my is is my husband. Amen. All in all, therefore, the Bible says in Hebrew, Amen. He was not the one who is sanctified and the one who sanctifies both come from the same. &gt;&gt; Therefore, he's not ashamed to call us brothers. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we come from the same family. Can you say amen so far? &gt;&gt; So let's help let's let's help a weak person. Lord laid it on my heart. Somebody must be weak here this evening or uh a little bit little bit doubting too much. &gt;&gt; Okay. And God says don't doubt. It's not your strength. It will be my strength. &gt;&gt; Amen. Salvation pertains to the Lord not to us. &gt;&gt; Okay. Please make the next one. I thank I think very much the the the the technicians. &gt;&gt; So you understand that brother Brandham says that the whole world will become uh mentally uh will have mental health issues will become crazy only those who have the Holy Ghost will be the only normal people on this earth. &gt;&gt; So let's understand where we come from. He said brother Bram said it's just like a little due drop. I don't know much about chemistry but it must be that the congelling of humidity on the stand or atmosphere and when it gets cold and dark it falls from heaven and drops upon the ground. It fell from somewhere. But the next morning before the sun come up, it lays there. The little fellow shivering. But just let the sun come up. Watch it go. The sun come up. It's laying there shining. It's happy. Why? The sun is going to caught it right back to where it come from. &gt;&gt; And that's the way with a Christian. Hallelujah. We know when we walk in the presence of God, something in us tell us that we come from somewhere. And we are going back again by that power that is pulling us. &gt;&gt; The little dew drop. It glistens and shines and shouts because because he knows he come from there. And the sun is going to draw him right back again. And a man that's an attribute of God born of God knows hallelujah. When he come in contact with the son of God, he's going to be draw up from here someday. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you must understand your destiny is your origin. That's right. &gt;&gt; Nobody can preach you into the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the bride came out of his bosom. &gt;&gt; As Eve was in Adam, &gt;&gt; the bride was in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. I mean, and I always did that kind of of of illustration. I said when when when the bride was in in in in in Christ on Calvary then the bride must have been in Melzdc. &gt;&gt; In what form ever? &gt;&gt; In what form ever? I cannot explain. Amen. And if the bride was in Melzdc and the bride was in the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; And when the bride was in the pillar of fire, the bride was in God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Therefore, brother Brandon was the first messenger. He said, "God is not anymore complete without you." &gt;&gt; Amen. Right? &gt;&gt; Because when you were born, God put part of himself into your soul. And David said in the Psalms, he said God made everything fine in his time. He even placed eternity into our hearts. And there's only one who is eternal. That's God. &gt;&gt; There's a difference between the bride and the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's still time to say, "Whosoever want, let him come." &gt;&gt; Amen. But if you were not in his mind, in his thinking, right? in the beginning. Nobody can join the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Everybody who was in him will be there. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham said, "Before the foundation of the world, God made a picture of us." Quote, "Brother Brandon, &gt;&gt; and I always say it like this." Now, here's the family of God. And here we were. &gt;&gt; I mean, brother, once you understand who you are, there's no need to become arrogant. &gt;&gt; Arrogance is a sign of an unsecured person. And revelation drives all fear out. &gt;&gt; Revelation and loves goes together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, so God took our souls for for and took the family took our soul and throwed it into seven church ages on seven continents. But he put place part of himself he put into us. So when the word came for their age there was a receiver that we could answer. &gt;&gt; When we gave our heart to the Lord Jesus it was not our intellect. It was our attribute answering to that call. Salvation is supernatural. You cannot train your children into it. God has to call them whenever he wants. &gt;&gt; Nobody tells God what to do and when to do and what to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when seven church age over, the whole family will be will be there. &gt;&gt; Nobody is missing. &gt;&gt; Nobody is missing. Therefore, you are not in the message because of William Brandham. &gt;&gt; You were there before. &gt;&gt; You were there before. You were already children of God in the mind of God. And God had to send a messenger because he had to pass by Samaria. &gt;&gt; And as your part of the word was in you, God needed a prophet to to just call you by that voice. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. The great person in our generation is not William Brandon. The great person is the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Please, please make the next one. So we understand. Here's what brother Brandon said. You can say, "Brother Marcus, if psychology is not, God understands life." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God is the engineer of life. &gt;&gt; God understands a human being. &gt;&gt; Please understand, God understands our children better than we understand them. &gt;&gt; Please understand, God knows us better than we know ourselves. Amen. And here brother Ramos he speaks about a shock or or spiritual amnesia and we know when he talked about the people from World War I brother Brham said now amnesia we are told it's caused uh caused to be at a place where you cannot identify yourself. Now it's an unusual thing. It don't happen too often but it's caused from a shock. It's somebody that you don't even know who you are. They find out from war from war. Sometimes soldiers get it. Sometime people get it. Another thing causes is worry. Worry will cause it. Worry has no virtue at all. &gt;&gt; Worry has no virtue at all. The third thing now worry sometime cause it. Another thing that cause it is among the people is getting between two opinions. That will cause amnesia. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Therefore, we tell the young people, you cannot stream everything. &gt;&gt; One preaches that and one preaches that. You have a pastor. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; He has a reason. He's the gate. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. You cannot just stream because one says this and the more you stream, the more confused you become. &gt;&gt; Amen. Exactly. So, amen. Amen. Two opinions and you become you you get an amnesia. But look at this. Amen. Now we came from God and and and please understand that I cannot explain everything uh not the person Marcus Beckov was had a predestination but the word in me let me say it like this okay I mean in that sense okay please understand I have to have a red line and and there's a lot of aspects that I'm not touching it's not that sermon doesn't have all the balance it cannot be okay please understand okay so so we were in the mind of God somehow we were that kind of people where God says to Job, "Where were you men?" &gt;&gt; When the sons of God were shouting for joy, &gt;&gt; where were you? Amen. Amen. We can say, "In you, in you, Christ." &gt;&gt; But we came on earth and we didn't come like Adam. &gt;&gt; Please understand when Adam came on earth, he didn't come as a baby. He was an adult. &gt;&gt; Eve was an adult. &gt;&gt; But we don't come as an adult. &gt;&gt; We wanted to come directly in our theophony. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And we landed in Georgia. &gt;&gt; Nobody when you were born, nobody asked you want to be black or white. &gt;&gt; Nobody asked you. You want to be male or female? Nobody asked you. You You couldn't choose your father. You couldn't choose your mother. &gt;&gt; If we could have chosen where everybody want to be part of Rockefellers, you understand? You couldn't choose your out your outbringing. Okay. But there's but but but God choose you because brother Bam said God pre-planned your birth &gt;&gt; for many generation. The message thinks it out to be &gt;&gt; okay. So you live in a body that you don't like. &gt;&gt; You wake up in the morning. You go before the mirror and said I don't I don't know you but I wash you anyhow. You come in family situate brother. I come from a broken family. And that's what I always preach. I I saw my father beating my mother. She was green and blue. You know, I received the baptism of the Holy Ghost, but these pictures are still in my mind. &gt;&gt; The baptism of the Holy Holy Ghost does not clean up your subconscious. &gt;&gt; Forget it. &gt;&gt; Amen. We were Pentecostals before. We were thinking, "No, no, no." But this message balance us out. &gt;&gt; Amen. That we have a soul, a spirit, a human spirit, a holy spirit, and we have a body &gt;&gt; and we have genes and we have circumstances, we have an upbringing. All these things &gt;&gt; make the man who is sitting right before us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It definitely is. So, &gt;&gt; so we understand. So when we came on earth, Amen. We came through the birth channel. &gt;&gt; I was there at the birth of my daughter. I tell you one thing, my wife needed one midwife. I needed two. Honest. That was for a man that's too much. That that's too much. &gt;&gt; You see? So, so, so the baby comes on earth. The midwife takes a baby. The first thing that you got in life was a spanky. &gt;&gt; The midwife said, "You will get more in life." You will see. You see, but remember, brother Blam said, "A shock &gt;&gt; brings amnesia. Our birth was a shock." &gt;&gt; Was a shock. We didn't come like Adam. We didn't come in our theophony. We didn't come as adults. We came through a shock. And once we were born, we did not know from where we come from. &gt;&gt; That's right. Is that so? &gt;&gt; Amen. But one thing, our father knew us. &gt;&gt; The little eagle did not know it was an eagle. But the mama eagle knew there is some part of me somewhere. &gt;&gt; I remember I mean I I was I was just I was just and I always make the same presentation, but this time I don't talk about Schwatzenegger, but I I I always tell my daughter. I always tell my daughter when I was a young teenager, I could dance like Michael Jackson. I could make the moonwalk. Today if I make it I have to go to the physiootherapist later. &gt;&gt; You understand? We we we we act like the world. &gt;&gt; We talk like the world. We want to be cool like the world. &gt;&gt; I remember I went through Hey chicks, how are you? Because we did not know who we were. &gt;&gt; And and and God was not ashamed of me because he knew one thing. Marcus is in time of ignorance. &gt;&gt; Amen. So never be ashamed of your unbelieving children. Don't be ashamed of them. God allows these things. &gt;&gt; He wants to see how we react on that life situation. These are challenges. &gt;&gt; Amen. Take them. Just give him a hug. I remember my little daughter, she was she was she was in kindergarten. And when the children are small, they like when daddy brings them to to uh to school or to kindergarten. Okay. But the older they get, at a certain moment, they said, "Okay, like a like a hundred yard before school. They said, "Oh, you can stop here, &gt;&gt; but it's raining." No, it's it's it's fine. And the older they get, the distance becomes bigger &gt;&gt; because it's not cool, you know, anymore if if the parents bring you. &gt;&gt; But I remember this and my daughter was with all the children in kindergarten. And I passed by as father and before all the children, she stood up. She said, "Hello, daddy." And I thought by myself, "The little one is not ashamed of me. I will never be ashamed of her." I told my I I told my little one, I said, "Honey, pap daddy and mama is always praying for you. But if you leave the message or if you leave Christianity, you become a Muslim. That's up to you. It's your life. &gt;&gt; But never forget, you will always be daddy's friend." &gt;&gt; You are not ashamed of me. I'm not ashamed of you. I pray that you find the way. &gt;&gt; But that love must be unconditional. &gt;&gt; I mean, it's not if you if you bring honor to the family. I mean God did not deal with me like this. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you understand that? &gt;&gt; So he gave she gave her heart to the law but he took away all the pressure of trying to perform something. &gt;&gt; If you come to church daddy daddy loves you. If you don't come to church daddy must hate you. That's nonsense. &gt;&gt; I'm the lower they fall these children the more they need a friend in life. &gt;&gt; You're not helping people by insulting them. &gt;&gt; Give them a hand. Give him give him give him give him empathy. Give him give him give him give him give him away. &gt;&gt; He said I I don't agree with your lifestyle but one thing is sure. You have a friend and that's your daddy and that's your mother. &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed be the name of it. But that's that that's the way how God was with us. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So please make the next one. So we came on earth and we didn't know who we were. So please understand one thing. That's what the Bible says in second Timothy. For men shall be lovers of themselves, conveters, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient, parents, unthankful, unholy. And look what the Bible says, without natural affections. &gt;&gt; Please understand one thing. When I was younger, I was reading it like this. These people outside are monsters. But they're not monsters. They are victims of a society. &gt;&gt; And this is a sick society. We must understand this. And a sick generation will produce a sicker generation. &gt;&gt; Do you understand this? And the answer for a sick generation is healthy families. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is healthy churches is warmness. Is the Holy Ghost is understanding is a is an anchor that when everything goes wrong, you know one thing, I have a father. &gt;&gt; I have a natural father and I have a spiritual father. Amen. &gt;&gt; Have you ever thought about that that that that that that scripture and I I so much love it. Here is the prodigal son and it was his mistake. I mean there's there there is no no second thought about that. &gt;&gt; It was his mistake. &gt;&gt; It it was his his decision. &gt;&gt; Okay. But at a certain moment the the miracle starts. The Bible says the boy came to himself. &gt;&gt; That was God. &gt;&gt; Amen. It wasn't a deacon. Nobody came by. &gt;&gt; But God spoke to that boy and the boy came to himself. &gt;&gt; People say sometime today, where are the miracles in our church? I tell you one thing, we are the miracles. &gt;&gt; We are the miracle. What God did in our life? That's the greatest miracle that there is. &gt;&gt; We are the miracle. And remember the first revelation that the boy has. I have a father. &gt;&gt; He doesn't say I have a brother Brandon. &gt;&gt; He doesn't say I have a No. No. He says I have a father &gt;&gt; and and my father is a great man &gt;&gt; brother. And if if if if if everything goes wrong in our life and we remember one thing, I made a lot of mistakes and they are all my fault. But I have a father. That's right. &gt;&gt; The message, the coming of William Brandham is not bringing us a doctrine. &gt;&gt; Because for 2,000 years, we tried Pentecostalism and it never worked. &gt;&gt; We tried legalism and legalism is only good to frustrate people. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you frustrate yourself, your children are frustrated, the pastor's frustrated, God is frustrated. Legalism serves to nothing. It's a dead end. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then we tried liberal liberal liberaliz liberalism doesn't work neither. &gt;&gt; Then we tried reformation but reformation never brought us to to to the capstone. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I mean then we tried anti-reformation. Then we tried denominationalism. And God watched all these 2,000 years. He says, "Boys, I tell you one thing. In the days of the voice of the seventh angel, the mystery of God will be revealed. Amen. &gt;&gt; The mystery, not mysteries, &gt;&gt; but the mysteries. And today we read the Bible different because we understand God. &gt;&gt; Brother, we are the first generation who understands the writer of that Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We understand God better than Adam in the Garden of Eden because we know what it means to be lost. &gt;&gt; We know what it means when God picks you up. &gt;&gt; We know what it means when we cannot hold our religion, but our religion is now supporting us. Amen. &gt;&gt; We know what it means when we sing Jesus my redeemer. We know what that is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We know, brother and sister. I tell you one thing. We're the only people on this earth who doesn't have a religion. We have a father. &gt;&gt; Don't make that message to be a religion. This message is way more than long hair and long dress. &gt;&gt; This message is a relationship &gt;&gt; between the almighty God and his children. &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord. So we understand now we have now two good football players Mr. Beckenbar Mr. Folks &gt;&gt; and both were world champions in football both were very successful coaches but both were completely different in their personality but Mr. Beckenbball he when he was losing a match he said look next time we win where's the problem Mr. Folks, he was always trying to explain himself and you must understand the defenders made that problem and the midfield players they were not and the technical part. Next time we will change this. He was always trying to explain himself. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And and and and people tried to find out where's the difference because the they had the same success and they found out the key is in the youth because Mr. Beckenbower comes from a wealthy family. His uncle was already a famous player. His father was a famous person. So he heard at home, "Boy, I tell you one thing, your name is Beckenbower." And you're always the best. You will find out. Okay? I don't talk about narcissism and so forth, but healthy personalities, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, Mr. Folks, he had no father and no mother. He was raised as a foster child. And they found out and they call it in science they call it the bonding &gt;&gt; between the parents and the child &gt;&gt; and how the first three years in a child's life is so important. It is forming the character of that boy. &gt;&gt; Amen. The love between the parents and the child will give that child such a personality that when the when when when the winds of life come they can they can they can survive. Did Jesus say give me a child four years we will form them for the rest of their lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. Therefore amen they need father and they need mother. &gt;&gt; All these kind of patchwork things will never work. God ordained a good father and a good mother. &gt;&gt; They need both. &gt;&gt; I mean to make healthy persons. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I I want to tell deals. I don't want to see my child only in church. I want to see my child happy &gt;&gt; happy serving the Lord. &gt;&gt; Not having a religion. Happy for the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. So I thought by myself look if the bonding in the natural life between the parents and the children IS SO IMPORTANT WHAT ABOUT THE BONDING of father God to his children &gt;&gt; so important the self perception how we see God the beginning of the Welsh revival came in a in a Sunday school &gt;&gt; and the Sunday school it was not brother Evans he was later the prominent person but it started in a Sunday school and the Sunday school teacher asked the class it was 20 30 people he said what does the Lord Jesus mean to you and the first one stands up and he says the Lord Jesus he is the sal he's the savior of the earth he died at Calvary and uh he is he is this and he is this and the Sunday school teacher said I don't want to listen what you learned &gt;&gt; I want to listen what does he mean to you? &gt;&gt; I want to listen what you learned in Sunday school. And then a child, a girl stands up and she says, "I love the Lord Jesus with all my heart." And that is when the spirit fell down. That was the beginning of the Welch revival. &gt;&gt; God was so pleased. God is not searching Muslimic worship. &gt;&gt; God wants heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God wants empathy. Amen. &gt;&gt; God is a loving God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's not only asking obedience. Every Muslim can ask for obedience. &gt;&gt; God wants your heart, &gt;&gt; your soul. &gt;&gt; People say, "I give so much for the church." When God has your heart, he has your money. &gt;&gt; He has your time. &gt;&gt; He has your Amen. Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; So, so the bonding I'm so interested in my own family, my my little girl. You see, she's now married. And for me, it was so important for her not to transmit a doctrine. &gt;&gt; I don't have to place brother Brandham in her heart &gt;&gt; because brother Brandon never died for us. Amen. In all respect, I want to have for her a relationship with the eternal father &gt;&gt; because maybe brother brother, we tried our best as parents. We tried our best &gt;&gt; but our best was not good enough. Be honest with one another. &gt;&gt; Our best was not good enough. &gt;&gt; And maybe we failed as parents. &gt;&gt; But if I make a connection between her and the almighty God, I know she has a father who will never fail. Maybe her earthly father was was was a loser. That might be so. But the heavenly father is a winner. &gt;&gt; I tell you, if you need a friend in life, the Lord Jesus is the best friend that you can have. &gt;&gt; The love of our soul. &gt;&gt; Honest. Honest. Therefore, you you look the church age book, the last page. Brother Brham said, "I never build up a ministry in my own words to have a follow that people follow me, but I want to create a relationship between believers and the and and the living God." &gt;&gt; Here is here is a woman by the name of uh Joyce Meyer. Now, Joyce Meyer is a is a is a female preacher. Uh we had some fans of her and she is uh how she is. I mean bride is bride &gt;&gt; but please understand outside of bride there is something &gt;&gt; outside outside of the bride there is an economy of God &gt;&gt; bride is bride &gt;&gt; there's people who will get eternal life even at the white throne judgment &gt;&gt; they're not bride but they receive something &gt;&gt; amen so why amen so so as as wrong as she is as wrong as she is in her doctrine but do you know her Sorry, brother. She was she was abused by her own father, sexually abused. She understood her own father because her father came from World War II. So, he was traumatized. She he did not know how to handle women and family. He was abusing his own his own daughter. &gt;&gt; So, she ran away from home w living in the streets throwing her away all her life. And then she said this and the Lord Jesus came and found me and and and brought me back to my call it potential sometime I'm missing some words brought me back just in life and I became a a preacher very prominent she's filled stadiums &gt;&gt; amen even it's not in the message let let her be what she is &gt;&gt; she said the Lord Jesus came and and brought me back from the condition where he said she said He healed the scars of my soul. I saw by myself. If the Lord Jesus can do this in a denomination, what can he do in the message? &gt;&gt; If we have the right perspective, if God brings people back in denomination and heals them from scars, from traumatas, what can he do in our midst &gt;&gt; if we understand that God loves so much his children? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So these people in the world, brother, you see the Hollywood stars, you see you see the girls and and and uh with with with all their things. Amen. It's it's it's it's a sign. The more a a woman I mean when we were younger, we were just blasting these jazzy belts and today we're not doing this &gt;&gt; because we're not helping people by just blasting. &gt;&gt; We're not helping them. But you must understand the more a person tries to uh upgrade the outside. &gt;&gt; Let me say it like this. The more she shows something is missing on the inside. &gt;&gt; Once you find your satisfying portion, you have everything to become happy. &gt;&gt; You understand? People are victims today. &gt;&gt; And we are not better than denomination. But God in his grace put part of himself into us &gt;&gt; so that we can say the deep calls to the deep. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; We are the only people who really can sing amazing grace. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We can really say what a friend we have in Jesus. &gt;&gt; We can sing I have a father. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So please make the next one. So we understand. I mean they found out again. I mean there's a sister and her baby. The first two years, three years in their life, they found out the the contact, the eye contact of the mother and her baby is so important. They made tests that they put the baby over over uh let me say a a a glass and down down under the glass there was nothing. So a baby would never crawl to the mother by fear. But they found out just by the eye contact of the mother, the baby loses all fear. &gt;&gt; How is our relationship to the Lord Jesus? Do we see him as a father who is always always angry with us? I mean, oh, do we have a friend, &gt;&gt; brother? Brother, we are in the message today and people are afraid of the of of the rapture. I said something is it seems that you have a problem, brother. &gt;&gt; You didn't understand the opening of the word. That's right. &gt;&gt; You have a problem. And people people think what what is Trump doing? Tremendous. No, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; It's unbelievable. No, no, no. Hey, we're not looking what Trump is doing in all respect. &gt;&gt; We're looking what the Lord Jesus is doing. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that you make the rapture because you have a father who takes care that you makes it? &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that will never be your own strength &gt;&gt; to make it? &gt;&gt; But you have a father who came down. That is Revelation chapter 10. &gt;&gt; Amen. To help you to make it. &gt;&gt; It was not Elijah finding the chariot. It was the chariot finding Elijah. &gt;&gt; You were not searching for your own theophony. Your theophony will find you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Please make the next one. Amen. Make make a stop. Here's here. I know I showed it already, but let me repeat. Let me talk from my heart. Can you say amen so far? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You say it's a little bit shallow this evening. No, no, it's not shallow. This is the opening of the word. &gt;&gt; This is the effect of the opening of what happened on Sunset Mountain. &gt;&gt; Brother Ramy said it will all it will constantly unfold itself. &gt;&gt; It must have an impact on our life. &gt;&gt; It's not a doctrine. It's a lifestyle. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are the first generation understanding God. &gt;&gt; Therefore, you cannot go into a denomination. There's no way because you said, "No, I need the message for this hour." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; So, that man is not grandfather. That man is her father. There are two unbelievers. You see, now that's his daughter. And they made that picture somewhere in Holland because the father has cancer. He would soon pancer of pancreatas. He would soon die. So the father understand his role. He says he says look I will die and nobody will bring my little girl to the altar. So what they did they were playing wedding ceremony and they stopped that ceremony at the point where the father brings the girl to the altar and they stopped there. Amen. So when the girl will marry one day, they will continue exactly at that point. Only that the girl can say my own father brought me to the altar. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother, I saw by myself if an unbelieving father can have that kind of an understanding. What about us with the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do we understand our children need us? &gt;&gt; They need us. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the and the lower they fall, the more they need us. the the the the the greater the nonsense that they is that they're doing in our life in their life, the more they need a good father and a good mother and a good church. &gt;&gt; Therefore, I always say dear when everything went wrong in your life, don't stay home. &gt;&gt; That is the moment to come in the house of the Lord and speak with your father, your heavenly father. Say, "Heavenly Father, here I am." Amen. &gt;&gt; Have you ever seen on a Wednesday that we have a little bit of a flu like and then you hear a voice don't go today. &gt;&gt; You're not a blessing. Have you ever heard that voice? &gt;&gt; In other words, it speaks English and German. I hear it in German. You hear it in English. Brother, I tell you, if the devil tells you to stay home, you tell the devil, you stay home. You stay home. Do do you understand? You will not become more spiritual by staying home. &gt;&gt; When everything goes wrong, that's the moment to come in the house of your father. Heavenly here I am. &gt;&gt; I'm a you you paid a price. You made a way. You called me. You are the alpha and you will be my omega. I don't know have a solution. A person said, "Brother Marcus, I have no way. Jesus is the way. &gt;&gt; If you have Jesus, you have a way. You're never in a dead end. No matter what you did, he has a solution." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Right. &gt;&gt; So blessed. Your children need you. They need your hug. Brother, we come from a generation of the old German people. We couldn't our fathers could not tell us how they love us. &gt;&gt; They did not. We we come we we we we we come from a clinical pure generation. Our father could not show emotions. &gt;&gt; That was our our generation. I always wonder myself how my father and my mother got a child. It must be by a spoken word. But I mean that the father comes and and and grabs the boy and says, "Boy, hey, I want to tell you one thing. I love you, man." We we never knew that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You see, and we brought it to the next generation because we said we were raised that way. &gt;&gt; I I took care of young people in our church since many many years. Now the children of their father they have already children and you can see how traces go through families &gt;&gt; and and and people say and I tell the father I said hey your boy is a sensible boy he needs sometime a little bit of encouragement not only correction a little bit of encouragement and the father said brother Marcus if you know my father he was even stricter or he was more hard I said but did your father had the opening of the word &gt;&gt; I mean we can only become like our father. When we understand who our father is &gt;&gt; and how he acts, &gt;&gt; then we become children of a father. If not, we become just children of a religious system. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen, &gt;&gt; brother? Our sisters, for example, now we took we take things for granted. Don't take it for granted. Here is sister. I mean, this is a Wednesday evening. I mean, here here's the cream of the people sitting here. &gt;&gt; It's a cream. I mean, I know people come from far. Those who are now in the internet, don't misunderstand. I understand. But here's Wednesday evening. Here's many young people. I mean, God bless their hearts. &gt;&gt; That's not that's not that that's not for granted that they should come. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, so Brother Braymond said, "Every woman wants to be pretty." &gt;&gt; I always tell the young sisters, you can be pretty but not sexy. &gt;&gt; That's the difference. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If God made you pretty, where's the problem? &gt;&gt; You're not more spiritual by being not pretty. &gt;&gt; If God made you pretty, you're pretty over. But don't be sexy. That is the difference. Don't make me sexy but pretty. No problem. But who tells the girls that they are looking good with their long skirt? You think school will do it? Nobody will do. But that person needs good words. &gt;&gt; Now who will tell the girl that she is a wonderful young girl and she's looking good? It must be daddy. &gt;&gt; We must all tell our youngsters, hey, daddy is proud of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Daddy sees you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? I know. I know that I'm bringing you into trouble right now, but tomorrow I'm leaving. &gt;&gt; Every every Friday I buy some flowers for my wife. I mean, we are German. I'm not too I'm not I'm not a hugging type of person. But but but I show my wife here. I see what they're doing. Okay. I mean, and and and every just just a little three $4. Not too much. Okay. But but but just just to make a sign. So when my little girl became a woman now, now now she asked me and me and me and and by inspiration that Friday I got one rose for my daughter. Okay. So my daughter was at the at the at the balcony and I she and she said, "Do you have some flowers for mama?" And I put the flowers for mama. Okay. And then she said, "And for me, she was a little smaller." And at that day I brought a rose for her and I showed that rose to her. It was another color. He said, "Mama, you see, you must understand one thing. I did not only buy these roses for my wife. &gt;&gt; I know that our daughter will watch us." Right? &gt;&gt; And I will I want her to teach if you marry one time a man, marry a person who will treat you the same way like I treat mama. &gt;&gt; That's what they learn at home. &gt;&gt; Do you understand these things? &gt;&gt; And can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So So let me let me just finish. Amen. Let me just just go on. Please make the next one. That means we understand that people especially the younger generation they learned God through us &gt;&gt; had to deal with a case in our church the father is a schizophrenia brother brother and and and we didn't see it because we were too naive at that time today I I I I I study a lot human human human spirits today. But at that time they could fool me because we thought the Holy Ghost will come and it would No, no, no. We have different areas. Body, soul, spirit, human spirit, holy spirit, genes, upbringing, social life, everything has has a little part in it. &gt;&gt; Must really understand. Okay. &gt;&gt; So, so but that person was free. He was he was like this in church and it was a complete different man. The boy said, "Brother Marcus, it's not the beating with the fist which hurt which hurts the most. It's the words. &gt;&gt; The word words can be can be more doing more damage." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Than beatings. &gt;&gt; And then it became a disaster and I I went to the family and I asked for forgiveness. The boy was 14 years old. He said, "Brother Marcus, you want to help us, but you cannot because you don't understand the case." And I I mean I was a minister at that time. I said, "Who are you to tell me?" And then I came to him and to the whole family. I said, "Please forgive me." I tried my best honestly, but I didn't understand where the problem lays. &gt;&gt; I'm a problem in the psyche. &gt;&gt; And then the boy said something to me that I never forgot. He said, "Brother Marcus, I do not know God as a father because I don't know what a father is." He said, 'If God is a father like my father was to us, then I have a problem. I said, 'No, you saw a complete perverted picture of what a real father is. A father would die for his children. &gt;&gt; A real father would not eat unless the children have eaten. &gt;&gt; Quote brother Brandham, God loves to do things for his children. God loves to bless. &gt;&gt; God loves to heal. Amen. &gt;&gt; God loves to have fellowship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So here we understand. Amen. That that that that was the picture that that that that that Rebecca one of these kind of pictures Rebecca had at the wall. And she said, "And when we went over to Tucson, my father went back, brother Brenam, and he got that picture and put it into the car and it's just an angel. And I think that is now Marcus. Brother Brandon wanted to show his his little girl. Hey, I want to tell you one thing. Daddy's not very long with you. &gt;&gt; I tell you one thing. If you're standing at the bed of your own child and that child has cancer, what message will you give? &gt;&gt; Will you just say God send a prophet? Hey, you will trying to make a connection &gt;&gt; between the almighty God. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "I don't know if you will be healed, but if your soul is in God's hands, you will wake up on the other side in paradise." &gt;&gt; Okay? You we will not be offended by little things. &gt;&gt; The most important thing for us would be just her soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Find peace with God. Nothing else. The rest is just secondary. &gt;&gt; So, so brother wanted to show his child, look, we are parents. We protect you. But never forget even if papa mama is not around never alone &gt;&gt; because you have an angel. And brother Brandham explains that our own theophony is our angel. &gt;&gt; Two questions to brother Brandham. Two times he said that's your own theophony. Brother Brandham was not the only one. The first one he did not invent theophanies. &gt;&gt; But as brother Brandham was not a reformer he was a prophet. He could see into the other dimension. He says my own theophony called a glorified body. He said is right standing here on that platform charging me like a battery. Quote brother Brandon. &gt;&gt; So what why does he say these things to tell us look when you feel alone there's somebody who goes with you. If you're in hospital and nobody cares for you, nobody knows your number when it becomes difficult in your life, then never forget you have a father. &gt;&gt; And your father is closer to you than you think. &gt;&gt; If you're a true believer, you can never say I'm I'm alone. You know, I'm never alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you're a true believer, you can never say I have no friends in the church because you say God God is my friend. &gt;&gt; He's my husband. He's my redeemer. He's my father. He's my mother. He's my brother. He's my everything. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Please make the next one. Amen. I'm just going through life now. Here's the man, Mike Tyson. Mike Tyson, he was he was he he was our hero when we were younger and and and and he says in that interview that I was reading as an unbelieving boy, he said, "When I see a person, I want to and my enemy, I want to force his nose into his brain." That's what he says and we would say that's a monster. &gt;&gt; But in the same interview he says look I was always and I hope I said the right word I was always a sensible person. You could easily hurt my feelings. I loved animals. I love doves and I and I and I had these kind of doves and these boys came to kill all my doves. And Mike Tyson says this. I trained all these muscles around me to protect my little soul. A person can have a a great uh presence, a great appearing, but in that great man is still a little child &gt;&gt; that can be hurt &gt;&gt; that has a certain feeling that can be touched by the Lord. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that God's calls? When we were evangelists, we thought altar call must be crashing the people down. Amen. That the altar is full and you're breaking these people down. But but God can call with love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Here's the man, the the colored brother, black brother. You understand what I want to say. I'm not politically correct. Okay. The African, whatever you want to call it. Brother calls him Gabe. and Gabe and and and and brother Ramy said the wife came to church and Gabe he just was wasn't interested in religion &gt;&gt; and the pastor he was always trying to convince Gabe to come to church and one evening they were just hunting and the pastor goes and Gabe stands there he starts crying and then the pastor turns around he said Gabe why are you crying he said pastor the sun is going down and I realize the sun of my life is going down too. And he says, "Do you see this, pastor?" Amen. All these animals that God gave me, everybody knows I'm I I I'm not a shooter at all. I will I will not make any kind of pride, you want to call it. Okay. I realized God gave me all these animals because I I knew he knew that I needed. He said, "Pastor, on next Sunday I will be in church because I want to serve a God who cares so much for me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey, that's different. That's another form of altar call. &gt;&gt; If not, if you're not, then God will. It's hey, there's no option. He's such a loving father. &gt;&gt; It's such a pleasure to serve the Lord &gt;&gt; that there is no way to leave the message. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Especially if we want and we cannot. So people asked brother Mike Tyson, he said, "Mr. Tyson, are you able to overcome the frustration of your use?" He says, "We I will never be able to for overcome the frustration of my youth." And I thought by myself, "Yes, by the Holy Ghost, you can overcome all scars in your life, but it's a process. &gt;&gt; It's not a prayer line. It's a operation that the Holy Ghost makes. &gt;&gt; You will be free, brother. I I I have to deal with cases of young people to trying to commit suicide. One case was right before my eyes. I know what I'm talking about. I have to deal with young people in the message. They cut themselves. He said, "Why does people cut themselves?" You know why people cut themselves? Because they say the pain in the flesh is not as terrible as the pain in my own in my own mind. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's a pain relief. Therefore, they cut themselves. &gt;&gt; I had to deal with people sexually abused. I had to deal with people emotionally abused. I had to deal with children neglected by the parents. All kind. And I always find out there's a way. &gt;&gt; There's a way. &gt;&gt; But it takes time. It takes empathy. It's not just a little prayer and think God can do everything in a moment. &gt;&gt; And it starts when people understand I need help. And the first thing that they must understand my father is on my side. &gt;&gt; And now here's the healing process that starts that changes a person. Not just with some little emotions but heals the person from the inside. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen, &gt;&gt; brother? Brother, the best thing that I can tell people to get healed from the scars of this world is the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the message of the hour is the balm of Gilead for a bride. &gt;&gt; It's the answer of God for a dying generation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Please make the next one. Amen. Amen. I'm hearing through. Here's here's Mary in Monroe. Brother Brham said here not long ago I saw in the vision a young a young woman dying they said she committed suicide it's about a year ago I forgot she was some kind of a girl that was very popular was up in the mountains I saw her die and told me and you can say at 4:00 just two seconds and submit they say she committed suicide but she did not it was a heart attack brother said I felt sorry for the girl she always seems to be a kind of a woman weary she needed something wish I could have got to the church. She needed Christ. She might have went to some cold formal church but she needed a real case of salvation with something in her heart to give that assurance. Her father she has never seen him. Her mother was in the insane institution. It was all on the girl's mind. She needed Christ. And then what? That's what we know. Brother, if the angel of the Lord was interested in Marilyn Monro who never came to church visiting the prophet telling when she will die on the second, don't you think that the angel of the Lord knows where our children are? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Please, please believe your own prayers. Yes. &gt;&gt; Please believe in a God who is not not a showmaker. God works great things. &gt;&gt; Without us perceiving it. &gt;&gt; Do you understand when we came on earth that the date of our expire was already on our front? &gt;&gt; Because when when when when when the angel could say when Mary and Mandro will die, God knows already when we will die. or if we make the rapture. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; There's there is a certain movement in Germany which says healthy living. I mean I tell you one thing, you can eat healthy but when your time is up you die healthy. &gt;&gt; Die healthy. &gt;&gt; But I want to tell you this the young people. We don't have much time. If you want to do something for God, don't waste. Brother, I never was in a false doctrine. Never was, never ever. But I have lost too many years of my life with immaturity. &gt;&gt; And today I I feel sorry. I said, Lord, let these these little years that I that lay before me, don't let me waste them with the nonsense. &gt;&gt; I I I I I I I I made I made stories out of nothing. I was always offended by this and offended by that. and he said this and they said this and I mean and today I said Lord let me use my time &gt;&gt; for your glory and for your honor &gt;&gt; somebody is wrong to me Lord forgive me I don't have time now to make a big story out of it let me go forward &gt;&gt; if you want to do something for God do it today &gt;&gt; if you want to tell a person how much you care for them don't wait for the for the deathbed &gt;&gt; tell them now &gt;&gt; tell your children how much you care for them if they serve the Lord or God, God has to call them. &gt;&gt; Salvation is supernatural. It's not we train them into something. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You want to tell your pastor how much you appreciate &gt;&gt; do it. &gt;&gt; I mean, I'm a traveling minister. As a traveling minister, you're always the man of the hour &gt;&gt; or of the minute. Pe people people come and say, "Oh, brother Marcus, we never heard it like this. It was so tremendous one. That's wonderful." But how much do we say to the person that are standing there every week? &gt;&gt; You're never wrong in sharing empathy, &gt;&gt; heart, soul, emotions, respect, &gt;&gt; LOVE. I'M GIVE IT OUT. IT WILL COME BACK TO YOU, MAN. &gt;&gt; Give it out. Our time is too short for for murmuring. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. How beautiful God caring. And here is God understanding life. Amen. At the white throne judgment, brother, God will be just. There's people on this earth, they are completely underprivileged. People in Africa, they are they die as children, starving for death. But God, the Bible says God is just. Those who are underprivileged on this side of the earth, of this side of life, they will be privileged on the other side. God is just. God is love. Sometime people stand they they they cannot follow because of circumcision or circumstances. God at the white throne judgment will understand. &gt;&gt; He will really be a just God. A just judge. Thank you Jesus. Can you say amen? I'm hurrying through. Give me give me just a little bit of time. Not much but Okay. Please make the next one so we understand. Please what I said in the beginning unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing under his wings. &gt;&gt; Amen. That means the opening of the word has a healing power. &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible says. And remember when we came on earth we were just subject in a body that we don't like with circumstances that we don't like not understanding who we were but when God came down into our generation he opened the veil for us that we understand where we come from &gt;&gt; what we're doing here. Amen. He understands. He he he opens our understanding. Therefore, brother Bram says in the seven seal, he says when the supernatural comes in, that's the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. That means God is giving the church now the understanding that we can think the thoughts of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That takes the amnesia away. Amen. &gt;&gt; That takes the frustration of life away because you understand I'm the hand in the hands of almighty God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now here is life and it's so miserable for Job and and and his health is down. Everything is is is is is coming to an end. And God doesn't send a social worker. I mean first the first one who comes to Job is a nice Lutheran. And he says, "Job, you just have to believe." Brother, when people go to difficult situations in their life, they don't need Bible slogans. &gt;&gt; Sometime no word is the best word. &gt;&gt; Instead of ah yes, we have come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then the next person that is now Marcus was a nice Methodist. He said, "Jope, you need that the emotions, you know, that it goes your spine up and down." And we all love that. &gt;&gt; But that is not the answer. &gt;&gt; The third one says, "Job, you need more gifts." And I have a gift. We have gifts. We're preaching for gifts. But a gift is not the answer for the challenge of this day. &gt;&gt; And the first one is God himself in the form of Elihoo. I'm El Shai. &gt;&gt; Elohim. Elhu. Amen. speaking to Job, he said, "Job, I tell you one thing. Don't look these 70 years on this earth because you will die and there's a remedy. Somebody paid the price. You become a young man again." He speaks about the millennium. And Job now he's he understands life is more than just 70 80 years in Georgia. Life is much more than this. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother, brother, if you God can bring God can make your life that you're never sick &gt;&gt; and God can you can can bring you into a life where you are in a wheelchair and it's the same God &gt;&gt; and you are still blessed even in the wheelchair &gt;&gt; because blessing is not outward thing. Blessing is God's love in you. &gt;&gt; So, so Job thought about hey you're right. I mean I die and I will be a young man again. Blessed be the name of the Lord. And then comes a voice and tied this to Sabino Canyon to Sunset Mountain. And he asked him just a question. He said, "Who darkens the counsel of God with words of without understanding?" And Job must have said, "Oh, oh, I think I thought." And God just asked the question, "Job, where were you men?" Amen. &gt;&gt; When the sons of God were shouting for joy and Job was so he he he remembered God brought his understanding. I must have been there when the sons of God were shouting for joy. Brother, the opening of the word is the healing for the bride. &gt;&gt; It's more than just nice feelings. &gt;&gt; It's more than I received the Holy Ghost. That's what we all receive when we were born again. It's more than just we have a nice shirt. God is God makes us to understand our life &gt;&gt; and now we can take the challenge of our life understanding I have a father &gt;&gt; and everything that came my way it was not my because I didn't perform right the time of of blaming myself is over I did my best but God allows it to just see one thing how do I deal with that situation &gt;&gt; God allows that People come into church and they are troublemakers, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He just wants to see how we react with them. &gt;&gt; We all want to have children, you know, they are standing like organ pipes. You know, you make a picture. &gt;&gt; We all love that. But God allows that we get difficult children just to see how we react on that. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I mean just to see is my child now mature enough to handle that situation and into into in his hands. Amen. Blessed be the name of therefore the capstone came. That is the mind of Christ &gt;&gt; to take the curse of our birth away and we now have the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For the first time God can talk to us. Therefore God says to Job, let me say it in my own words. Stop being childish. &gt;&gt; Stand before me like a man. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm a stop I job. I will not baby you around anymore. &gt;&gt; I will not take all your problems away that you feel nice. &gt;&gt; I will give you more problem but I make you to understand that I am the almighty God. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Please make the next one. Amen. Please make the next one. I'm finishing. Amen. Make the next one. Please. hiring them. How many? Three three four quote. Can you say amen so far? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This message did not bring us a religion, &gt;&gt; not a doctrine. &gt;&gt; It brought us a father. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Here's what Brother Brham said. He speaks about he he speaks about uh the prophet Elijah so depressed. Amen. wanted to die, wanted to give up. And the prophet said, I would imagine every all around the place was swarm of angels. God came down. He said, "My poor little tired servant, he's so nervous and tore up. He don't know what to do. I want to pick out the angel standing here that's got the softest hands. Don't you scare him." Walk over and stroke his bro, right? Easy. and I want the best cook among you and got up there and got all the vitamins that you can find and put it into his into his cornmeal. The world turned him down, but I'm going to treat him right. Hallelujah. That means praise our God. Don't get scared of that. Bring forth the best that we got. Cook him a corn cake. Set him down some water. And the soft-handed angels went down, stroked the little servant of God on the bro. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And then brother Bram said then we don't believe in tattoos &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; I mean we have a German minister he had a tattoo of the seven angels somewhere said okay all things are possible in the message but if you want to have a tattoo then you make that tattoo okay put it on your heart quote brother Brandon remember if you have done your best God still got those angels in order he loves you just the He loved Elijah. &gt;&gt; Brother, if you did your best, &gt;&gt; then you count on your father because God knows. Do you do you remember what we was reading in the in the beginning? God gives talents according to their capacity. &gt;&gt; God knew that we were born with deficiencies. &gt;&gt; Therefore, God had to explain the life of William Brandham. He said, "I came from the presence of the Lord to explain your peculiar life." Is that correct? &gt;&gt; And the opening of the word explains our peculiar life that we can go forward. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That nothing stands anymore in our because we know where we come from that our father is with us and he will take us home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So, so, so, brother Marcus, do you make the rapture? I make it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because of what? BECAUSE OF MY FATHER. &gt;&gt; Will you make the rapture? Yes. But brother Marcus, I'm weaker than you. The weaker you are, the stronger is your father. &gt;&gt; God picks you up at the place where you're standing. &gt;&gt; If you can raise yourself, God is coming in your direction. But if you're very low down, God comes even lower down to pick you up. &gt;&gt; Because none of his children is missing. Right? &gt;&gt; God is not standing there at the rapture. Say, "Okay, we we we see who will make it. Okay, maybe the rapture is not your making. God came down in Revelation chapter 10 and Christ came down &gt;&gt; to bring you up." &gt;&gt; Blessed be. That's the difference between a dictator and a father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the difference. God is not a dictator. God is a father. God is not trying to help you to God is not happy if you make the rapture. God makes sure &gt;&gt; that all shouldn't make the rapture because with you, brother said, God is not anymore complete. &gt;&gt; Please make the next one. Brother Mar, brother Marcus, but that means I can drink, I can smoke and so forth. No, you have you have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It will not allow that you drink and smoke. &gt;&gt; Amen. Make the next one, please. I'm hurrying through. I know I'm a little bit over time, but give me that just to round it up. Okay, here's brother Ren. We all know the storm is there. He speaks to the storm. He comes down. Look what it is. And in a few minutes, the sun was shining nice and warm. That's true. God knows the truth. It stood right there. I got numb all over the very God of creation. It's in his hand. What is he telling me? And I picked my gun, wiped off the scope, started walking back, go down the hill. And something said to me, "Why don't you stroll with me through this wilderness? Walk with me." For the first time in thousands of years, God revealed his heart. God does not ask for obedience. God says to the prophet, "Why don't you walk with me?" &gt;&gt; Amen. God loves to have fellowship &gt;&gt; with his children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; For the first time, God is not only showing himself as the consuming fire, but as a loving father. &gt;&gt; And he does not command the prophet, if you don't, then I will. God just asked him, why don't you walk with me? Do you understand God opening his heart? How he loves to walk with his church? &gt;&gt; You say, "I want to have fellowship with Jesus." But I want to say Jesus said, "I want to have fellowship with you." &gt;&gt; If you pray, just wait long enough. He comes &gt;&gt; because he wants to have more fellowship with you than you want to have fellowship with him. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. For the first time, God reveals his heart. I would like to to walk with you. &gt;&gt; And and that's not only for brother Bren. He was just the first fruit. &gt;&gt; God tells his bride, why don't you walk with me? You know, prayer when we were younger, prayer was everything. Lord, do this and do this and do that. And do I mean PRAYER IS TALKING WITH YOUR FATHER. &gt;&gt; I mean, and you tell let him know, HEAVENLY FATHER, I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. &gt;&gt; I mean, we as Germans, we are we are not crying people. &gt;&gt; Only in football when we when when we're losing. But I hope when we are praying there's times &gt;&gt; that we open our heart and so Lord Jesus we love you so much &gt;&gt; I don't find even words to tell you how I love you &gt;&gt; and God looks you back and says I put my name Marcus and I love you so much too. &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Please make the next one Harry through. Amen. Here's the beautiful God being a father. Therefore, I have a good news. You make it &gt;&gt; and I make it. Brother, never forget gospel is good news. &gt;&gt; Even after 30 years in the message is good news. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here's brother Brandon 1960. And I told you last time here there was a new ministry speaks about the third pull. I spoke with some of the brethren today and was telling them about what happened. Just remember that the first time I was here, you remember the Lord had told me something was going to happen. Change in the ministry. It happened. Said another one is going to happen and it happened. Now there is another one greater far greater than all the rest of them put together already confirmed and ready. I hope it happens tonight. I just may say that I don't have time to explain it to you but the brothers who does know about it it's wonderful. It be a such a great thing for the people and I'm grateful to God that the hour is soon at hand when God is going to help his children especially and that's now you and me and you put your name and I put my name in. Especially it will be for those who can't master the faith to raise up and get a hold of God like they should. I believe the Lord is providing a way for us now to take care of them. Also, some run into faith that they can just reach over receive anything. Why that's great faith. Some of them has mustard seed faith and has to wait so long to get through. I believe the Lord is making a way for those people now. &gt;&gt; God helping especially the weak ones among us &gt;&gt; because he's a father. Brother, the opening of the seal is not to make us more arrogant that we know some mysteries. You will if you have amnesia or demands like me, you forget all the mysteries. But we will not forget the person. Can we not forget what this message showed us? A father who comes down to help especially the weak ones among us. &gt;&gt; The weaker you are, the more your father cares for you. &gt;&gt; That's the difference what I told you in the beginning between people who do not want and people people who want but they cannot. &gt;&gt; Amen. people, many people cannot and God comes down. He said, "Look, I paid the price and I come down to help you to achieve what you need." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? If the musicians would come Amen. And I finish. You love the Lord. Now, please please be seated. Then we just have uh if if you play softly, maybe do you have the chorus I have a father? Okay. If you just would play that softly and if I'm over time, please forgive me. But the subject is so beautiful. &gt;&gt; Do you can do you love the Lord Jesus? &gt;&gt; Do you understand? We are not brandites. &gt;&gt; We are not in a cult. We're not in a sect. But we understand that this messenger was &gt;&gt; Eleazar. &gt;&gt; Bringing the bride to Isaac, &gt;&gt; our true bridegroom. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Look, and here is the answer what I was reading. Why did one of these three men fail? He was just putting that little talent into the ground. You You have a father. Okay, then we can sing it together. Why did he make that fatal mistake? because he had a false perception. Look what he says. And he which received one talent said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art the hard man. How how did he know that? That was his own picture that he had, brother. And we had 2,000 years of church history of portraying a God who is always beating his children, especially those who came from from reformation like us. Amen. And and he said this, I was afraid and went and hit that challenge. Brother, that is the case. You remember the vision that brother Brandham had with that three cornet stick and the woman want to stand up and here comes that man and beats her down again. Every sect works with fear. If you don't come, if you don't do this, if you miss the rapture here, you miss the rapture there. I tell you one thing, the bride is the rapture. She is part of the rapture. But this man was so paralyzed to do anything because he so much feared that he said I was afraid to make a mistake. Brother, if I don't see this in the message today in people, Amen. Amen. And the man and and here comes the Lord. He said, "Who told you that I'm a hard man? who painted the picture of a Lord Jesus. Do you know that every song that we sing speaks of a gentleman, speaks of a father, of his mercy who endures forever and ever. We don't talk about worldliness. We nobody's worldly here. Do you see that? That that every song that we sing speaks about a savior who is so beautiful. He's so great. Why shouldn't we preach like this? Why should I preach a hard cause? A person said, "Brother Marcus, are you a strict believer?" I said, "No, I'm a happy believer. &gt;&gt; I'm not a strict believer. I'm a happy believer." We are not worldly. But I put all the slavery of religion. I left it behind me. &gt;&gt; The opening of the words set me free because now I understand my father &gt;&gt; and I'm a happy person. And we are not worldly sins. Not at all because we have the Holy Ghost. But that kind of fearing and missing the rapture. The bride cannot miss the rapture. She is the rapture. &gt;&gt; And you say, "But brother Marcus, I'm not ready." Then your father's waiting. When will be the rapture? When you're ready. But I'll miss it. No. No. You are not missing. You're part of it. &gt;&gt; You cannot miss it. God will wait until all his children. That's a father. Amen. Many times we make warnings. We go to church. We say if you're not ready in 5 minutes we're going. But in honesty, did we ever do that? In reality, then we're waiting. Okay. In five. Okay. And then when the family is there, the door closes and we go to church. God God will not forget one of his children. Cannot. He's a father. He's a father. You're not just a number in the church. You are part of that word. The whole plan of God is not anymore complete without you. That is your dignity, not your color. So there's no place after the opening of the word for minor minority complexes or superiority complexes. We talk to theophanes. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I have a father. God bless you. It's a pleasure to share these things. Amen. Amen. Amen. Do you have the song I have a father? If if not uh create in me a clean heart. Is that fine? You have it. And then we pray. If I was over time, please forgive me. Amen. Yes. I have a father. He knows my name and he never leaves me. No matter where I go. He knows my pain. He knows my every thought. He sees here that falls and he hears me with a call. &gt;&gt; I have a maker. I have a name before my heart. Before even time be my life was in his hand. He knows my name. He knows my every thought. He sees each tear that falls and he hears me when I go. I have a father and he calls me his own. He'll never leave me. No matter where I go, he knows my name. He knows by every thought. He sings a tear that falls. He hears me when I call. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank God for the journey that we were on. Yes. &gt;&gt; You know, lots of times in life we didn't understand the journey that we were on, &gt;&gt; but praise God. You receive the Holy Ghost. The Lord leads you. He calls you. &gt;&gt; On that journey, it's just one step at a time, one battle at a time, one valley at a time. &gt;&gt; But praise God, he never left us. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. And one day he come to reside inside of you. &gt;&gt; Well, that didn't finish the journey. You're still on that journey. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But as brother Marcus was saying, as the word begins to open up, you begin to understand the journey that you've been on. &gt;&gt; Lots of things you didn't understand, things we still don't understand. But praise God, we've been through the opening. By the opening of the word, we begin to see our journey. We begin to see who we are. &gt;&gt; Yes, Father. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Clarity comes in our lives. Yes, Father. &gt;&gt; And as the word begins to open up to you, &gt;&gt; he becomes more precious to you. &gt;&gt; Yes, Father. &gt;&gt; He becomes more dear to you. &gt;&gt; What a difference, Father. Amen. &gt;&gt; I thank God for our father. &gt;&gt; Yes, Father. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; He really spoke to me tonight. Thank God for the word. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, before we dismiss, we want to make sure all hearts and minds are clear tonight before we dismiss. If anybody has a need or anything, the Lord's here to meet your need. You can receive whatever you have need of right now. The word, he said he sent his word and he healed them and he delivered them from their destruction. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word has been preached tonight. He's here to meet your need. &gt;&gt; You just reach up and claim it. &gt;&gt; And if you have a need this evening, &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; our brother's here and we brother Joe was singing. You re come and receive what you have need of. like these. Oh, I sing out a song. Yes, I sing out a love song to Jesus. In moments like these, oh, I lift up my hands. Yes, I lift up my hands to the Lord. Take you sing moment. Yes, I sing a song. I sing my love to Jesus. Oh, can you praise him? I lift up my hands. Yes, I lift up my hands to you. See, I love you. See you. &gt;&gt; Can I take the liberty to ask again if somebody wants to receive the Holy Ghost if you allow? Oh, I see my sing to Jesus in moments like these. Yes, I lift up all my lift up my hands to now while the music is playing. Thank you. While the music is playing, please sit down for a moment and I ask our brother if I can take the the liberty as I'm a guest minister. While the music is softly playing, I want you to all close your eyes and please that we don't make a filming right now. And I want all of you that says, "Lord, I want the Holy Ghost or Lord, I want to come back in that estate that I can grasp things that kind of relationship to you. I want the Holy Ghost maybe for the first time of some of the youngsters see you. I don't want a religion and while all the heads are bow in respect to one another, I want you to stand up and before the presence of the Lord before all his angels and to make sure I need a father. Amen. I want you to stand up, but not that everybody stands up. Only if you know that's your calling for the moment. It's not a general thing. Okay. I'm Heavenly Father, you see the hands and the people standing. You just used a little man from Germany to speak to the hearts of these people. And the deep call to the deep. It was not We were not preaching fear this evening. We were not preaching condemnation this evening. We were not preaching judgment this evening. That has its place but not for this evening. We were just presenting the Lord Jesus Christ to be a father, a provider, a husband, a bridegroom, a friend in life. And Lord, here these people are standing and I know many of them are true believers, but they need another sign from you. Just take your hands, Father, and lead them for all the days of their life. Father, may you be their their joy in all the situations. Father, may you take them and that they can say the Lord is my shepherd in all my situations. So I ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. And I want if somebody is here while we are sitting down please who never gave his life to the Lord Jesus and you're just raising your hands and he says I want to receive &gt;&gt; the Lord Jesus Christ in my life and we don't call you in the front but I want you to raise your hand if you never gave your heart to the Lord Jesus. Amen. He says, "Heavenly Father, I need a friend in life and I want to ask you to become my friend." Amen. You just raise your hands. Hallelujah. God bless you young man right in the back.
