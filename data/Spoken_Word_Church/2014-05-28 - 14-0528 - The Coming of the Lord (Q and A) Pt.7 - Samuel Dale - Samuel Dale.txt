word and healed us so we believe it have your way now and god is in jesus blessed name amen and we're going to have comments and questions so we're just going to review a little bit and then you get ready you get your questions and things and we'll try to get into that tonight if we can and talk about the things we've been been dealing with first john 2 verse 26 these things have i written unto you concerning them that seduce you but the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you and you need not that any man teach you but it's the same anointing teaches you of all things and his truth and there's no lie and even as it have taught you you shall abide in him now little children abide in him that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming you may be seated the lord at his blessing to the reading of the word yeah now when i get down to it we're going to do a lot of reading in just a minute and all because you know i make a lot of statements and i want you to have these so i decided to just run off the the quotes uh you know tonight and they're on the internet part so they will be able to see what we're talking about now we've been for about let's make seven services talking about the coming of the lord and we know that the coming of the lord is not like we think it is we had it figured out as being a shout and a voice of trumpet and the things and all the to do and the horns blowing and everything we found out that wasn't right and we found out about his coming is how did he come first to redeem his bride then he comes to catch away his bride and then he comes with his bride in the millennium all right then we know that the point we've went through the the first advantage the prophet said has three advents to his coming that that's already taken place in the basis that he came to redeem the bride now we're not talking about the coming of the lord just say to israel to this that we're only talking about the coming of the lord to are in involved in the bride of jesus christ because that's our part it's not nothing about israel to do with us you know now i know they receive this same message etc and we we believe that but we're just talking about the coming of the lord to the bride all right and we know that he's already come to redeem paid the price and and it's like i was trying to show you i believe that today you receive the new birth that that starts the part we would call the second coming of jesus christ or the part to where that it would be that he would come to catch us away because he's not going to catch everybody away at this part it's not going to be an end to the world it's not going to be you know a group thing it's going to be a little bride of christ that has made herself ready and you can only do that by first receiving the new birth so actually when you receive the new birth that started his coming right there to you as an individual you know in that new birth all right because that's the part we're concerned with we ought we believe the part where he died for our sins we believe the part where that we're going to come back with him in the millennial reign and all but that those are are not uh to say they're not worthy but they're not present tense i've been thinking about something on that because that's in my my thinking of you know maybe we'll speak on it some uh we're talking about something taking place now not talking about what was or taking or taking you know talking about what will be because wasn't that the way the prophet said it he said that's the way we do he said but we miss what's going on now our part our our doings all right but remember now the reason i connected connected or tie into the new birth is because i believe the new birth is a revelation all right it's a revelation of jesus christ personally to you coming to live in you and in being that then that is a fulfillment of the part that he has come we know for a certainty that he has already come you know to redeem why because we are experiencing the part of that in our own lives in our own redemption all right and see then in doing that we're we're not looking pious not looking future looking to present tense and seeing that what we're talking about must be revealed remember rapture is revelation but then what the prophet say he said the bride would be waiting for the revelation of the rapture all right then there's something about it that you know has to be and the rapture is only for who the royal seed of abraham it's only for those with the new birth because nobody else will be concerned in it and it'll be all the way down through time of all of those who has received the new birth and there are now souls under the altar crying how long you know waiting on you and i to come to a place to understand what's going on all right and see then that's what i've pointed at for 40 something years that i've tried to get you to look at is to see what's going on not what will be not what has been but what's going on now and and in the bible nobody ever amounted to anything until that was made known to them of god right then moses at the burning bush no good about mama he run you know in her revelation that was fine but he didn't have a revelation but one day he got a revelation he heads to egypt a lot of difference all right see then in that it must be revealed to us what we're talking about not just be able to quote it right there's a lot of people today say we know jesus christ died for our sins but does that save them why not because it's not revealed to them but yet they have knowledge of it yet they can quote and say things you know and live a good life and walk and all and do it but yet if it's not a revelation right amen all right see now this message must be revealed to us not just quoting it not just carrying it not just reading it no more than it was when we carried the bible and had a trinity in her hands no we didn't yeah you did you had a bible in your hands that you thought taught a trinity right but you see my point is right now we talked about tying together the coming of the lord and seeing what was already taken place and seeing where we're at in the point of the second advent or point of catching away and then we started talking about the rapture that the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout all right but you know that's not a that's not a shout from god unless it's revealed the voice of the seventh angel spoke the words fine but if it's not revealed what he said what good is it but see people will fight you over well the prophet had the revelation well amen but has it been revealed to you and i it don't have to be revealed to me just reveal to him well then he's the only one going right right i mean if that's the way it is he's the only one going because the only one with the revelation all right and we went through those things over and over and over reading and i've tried to hold that one point to you the shout has already went forth it was the message that we have heard this message that we talk about that was delivered to us by a prophet i believe that was the descendant of god all right because we know that he doesn't set foot on earth in a physical body a corporal body you know but yet he becomes visible among us and raises the dead and we go in the rapture so that that's not a physical part but it's a spiritual revelation amen now the other day then we ended up talking about it what is it what is the coming of the lord whatever stage you put it in stage one to redeem stage two to catch away stage three uh with him coming back whatever it is it's a revealed word what else could it be what are you looking for in the coming of the lord oh we don't believe it now about that hi to the trades you know we don't believe them things anymore but what do you believe you just moved up a step and you just put it all in the prophet and nothing for us come on like one man quoted one time he said the way we say it is all god was he put into christ and all christ was he poured into brother branham he died and took it with him you know and that's the way people i mean there's statements but remember we're talking about the revelation of jesus christ personally to you that starts in that new birth at faith in the growth development up the statue of a perfect man to come out to the headstone and i'm not looking somewhere else for a headstone come on i believe this message amen is a shout out i believe this message when you fully understand it is the headstone to the church but it must be revealed not just talk about it it must be revealed and to be revealed it means it's something personal to you as i illustrate martin luther preached many times about it but one day it come off the pages of that book into that man's heart well when it comes off the pages of this bible and these quotes that we have the prophet's message into our heart have something personal to you and i right then you ain't got to worry about a thing brother dale you preach hard and honest you're afraid you run people off you can't run people off it's got the holy ghost amen that's right well is it true i mean that's right come on i thought there was just one holy ghost i thought there was just one revelation i thought there was just one bible i didn't know it had so many avenues to it that everybody can take their own and run what they want to i thought it was to make one beautiful picture of the revelation of jesus christ personally to you and he's the head of the body the scripture says he who the revealed word the revealed word but now watch see then if he does not become visible i mean physical among us you know in that basis but he will become visible among us and raise the dead and we go in the rapture it must be a secret coming that we talked about that the world will know nothing about this coming yet they can talk about that coming they could prove he walked her on the shores of galilee they could prove he died and they can believe in a millennium to come but what about now amen what about now what about the hour that you and i are living see then i believe if that shout is the message it's revealing his coming are you following me the shout is the message the lord descends from heaven with a shout all right if he descends from heaven and shout that message is his coming amen the part to our day not to the jews not to somewhere else not the end of the world but you and i see then it's the revealing of the word and then we know that the voice of the archangel is the same one that lays raised lazarus right all right if it's the same one raised lazarus he would be here with us to raise the dead and we'll go in the rapture it's putting all the honor and glory on him not on you and i if we're anything whatsoever he made us it's not what we are it's what he is all right see the voice of the archangel then would be here on earth if the shout is here and the lord has come i meant to bring it i don't think i did in my jokes i found that quote we're brought around talking about it's going to be solids in heaven because ain't going to be nobody up there i'll bring it sunday i think i got it in my notes in here but but think about it now jesus does not put on or set foot on earth till the millennium but he'll be visible in the bride and will call the dead out of the ground i believe man all right now i want to read a whole lot because i know that i make a lot of statements and i put a lot of quotes in but i wanted to give you these where did you see why that all of these years why i believe what i've believed that i believe that the coming of the lord is the revealing of his word because we're not dealing with a physical part all right now and in being the coming of the lord then the bride would be the son of man the word made flesh is that who the son of man was is that john 1 14 and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us all right and to see it then that the bride will be because of what god makes her the fullness of the godhead bodily but you see people don't want to talk about that they want something another some hoopla some other form but what about you because remember the only way we can come become up this statue of a perfect man is through the opening of the word all right well no we just we just practice it we just do practice all you want to yeah and you'll get what the prophet said on stature of perfect man or blasphemius 9 1. he said a lot of people have a portion of these virtues and not even born again so just go ahead and practice you just get a portion of the virtues and that makes you a good neighbor but it don't make you a christian it's only when the word is revealed to you or you're a christian all right see then there's not anything to to be considered if the prophet said what we are is there anything wrong with us saying what we are that he said we are now there's a lot of doctrines around the message that a lot of people have said a lot of things about what we are you know what everybody boy they'd joyously run in and scream oh look at it look at it until you just get settled down and talk about the revealed word starting from the new birth going all the way up through the pyramid and comes out to be the headstone to the church and they'll have to be a headstone to the church before she can leave now in doing that then the church has always had a head christ with the head of his church in luther's age wesley's age pentecostal age but then that means there's something different about this age you remember the series right prior to this that we talked about the corner wheat that would die and fall into the ground and now that we talked about it being the bride of jesus christ would return to the original grain not if it wasn't grained down to the ages but to return to the original grain and the original grain we read then was the son of man but brother dale i can just listen to some of these others and i can just enjoy and i and i can see what they're talking about that's what one fellow is telling about said he was preaching or this man was preaching this lady said well i see what he saw he said my lord lady that ain't even in the bible what the man was preaching about but she could see it i can see that when a man told me one time here we're talking about something he said i can see that i said well i certainly can't code it ain't in the bible but see this i can see that i can see how they could be three but yet there's just one but i really don't know maybe there's two or four or six or oh i can see that well i can't i can see one and that's it but what about a prophet telling us what we are but yet it's hard for us to believe but he says we are you know that jesus told the church paraphrasing words putting it with the prophet that by him coming and living in us would make us the bride of christ and would make us just as perfect as he is now i don't ask for a raise of hands but because you might want to bow your head in the next statement but see a lot of people can quote that but has it been revealed to you has it been revealed to you that you're just as perfect as god is by being in jesus christ you see what i'm talking about see then the prophet would tell us a lot of things and about us but do we believe it that's why i just chose to give them to you just give you the the quotes and then if it's time for question and answer if not we'll take it up sunday you don't worry about it let's just read some things the prophet says about you and see if you can believe it very simple things that we've heard him make the statements but i hope you'll follow the reading the best i could lay it down to make it grow grow in growing growing growing go ahead brother anderson pull up number one the good shepherd priest in 1957 308 and look what he says he's talking about jesus christ was the son of god he had the spirit without measure we believe that in him never dwelt just a part of god but all of god was in his son christ jesus he was the fullness of the godhead bodily all god was poured out in christ all that god was was in christ and all that christ is he poured out on the church no but you keep refusing it now what would be why would a prophet make that statement but you keep refusing it to refuse something is to turn it down right to reject it to not agree with it is that right why would he say the things that he said all the years but then put it in there and say that if you refuse it the things if i do not the works of my father believe me not and as the father has sent me how did the father send him the father sent him and went with him and in him so send i you he's sending the church in the same way that god sent him do we believe that the god that went that sent him went with him the christ that sends the church goes into church and the very same works do we believe it look at the next one e48 having conferences okay you can go ahead and read that part because that's part of the quote look what he says go ahead and roll this part up the holy spirit that called him emmanuel god with us announced god in us the same spirit we receive it by portion measure he received it without portion or measure that's easy to understand none of us are god the fullness but just remember around the world put it all together and what have you got you've got his fullness right look he received it without portion of measure in him was the fullness of god all that god was he poured into christ and all christ was poured over the church amen that day you'll know that i'm in the father the father in me and i and you and you and me oh my when it comes that day now we're working on god got orders just keep moving so evidently at that day you'll know so it evidently means that you don't get it right off hand but that you move into it right see all god was how many times did brother brown say oh god was he poured into christ and all christ poured into the church now if he was the fullness of the godhead bodily and then you pour him into the church what does that make her we each want to have it as a portion right but all around the world it makes her the bride of christ the fullness of the goddess bodily is that sensible then we don't have to worry about trying to be something just be the portion that we are but remember the explanations and i'll be glad to get them for you of how he explains that he explains it like a drop of water or a teaspoonful out of the ocean right but remember his definition of that the same identical chemicals of the entire ocean is the same chemicals in the spoonful it's just according how it's measured out but do we believe it in a portion do we actually believe it do we believe the things that he has said about us go ahead to perseverance paragraph 13 31 1962. now god prepared himself a body in the form of the lord jesus which was the christ meaning the anointed one and now all that god was was in christ he was the fullness of the godhead bodily that's what the scripture says now and all that god was he poured out in christ he was emmanuel god with us and all that christ was he poured out into the church what is it anointed one to continue his work that his word might live constantly go ahead be not afraid 1962 e-79 now here is what it is i just got through saying god is in his people all that god was he poured into jesus do you believe that he was the fullness of the godhead bodily and all jesus was he poured into the church the holy ghost is that right so it's god in us god in you it's not it doesn't make you anything it's not the holy mountain or the holy church it's the holy ghost not the holy people the holy ghost it's the holy ghost in the people not holy people holy ghost is that simple go on to the next one a testimony upon the c62 e88 go ahead and roll it all the way so we got all down at the bottom all that god was he poured into christ he was the fullness of the godhead bodily and all that christ was he poured into his church that day you'll know that i'm in the father father and me knowing you it's god it was god above us god with us god in us see what i mean there it is the same god the prophet said outside of the corporal body being here he's here the same as he was when he walked ashore to galilee where's he at in his bride amen just keep reading christ is a mystery god revealed paragraph 1 59 16 to 162 god expressed in jesus who was both father son and holy ghost the fullness of the godhead bodily now the complete fullness of the godhead bodily dwells in his church remember i said a while ago that's the way i put them down put down what you thought get your thought get your thought now lay it on you now the complete fullness of the godhead bodily dwells in his church the preeminences all that god was he poured into christ and all that christ was he poured into the church the believers so now he's saying the complete fullness of the godhead dwells in his church go ahead to the next one take him across the mystery of god reveal you remember it's in a threefold he's talking about the second fold of the threefold manifestation first to express himself in christ then express itself through the church and the same thing christ was the word and the church becomes the word when it lets the word go through them right roll it on up because we're going to go down to paragraph 380. and in there there would be a time come forth when he could express himself in fullness of his godhead deity through his church are you reading and there there would be a time come forth when he could express himself in fullness of his godhead deity through his church how the preeminence is in his church oh my what the anointed man now the anointed people oh my to bring back the anointed bride and the bridegroom what about it do we believe we're the fullness going to the next one the mighty god unveiled before us 1964 629 paragraph 130. it was god in christ god and man the fullness of the godhead bodily in a man god and a man and now it's god in men the fullness of god in the godhead bodily in his entire church manifesting himself fulfilling his word well i guess in a way you could say that remember the mule is the one that says that you know remember that well i just don't see it do you mean it's not true you you say i don't believe it that mean it's not true does it make it not true because you don't believe it you know what he don't even really need nobody to believe it to make it true right because it is true is what he said we want to believe what the prophet said about this that and the other but what about the rest of it what about lean not unto your own understanding 65 120 paragraph 17. the only way you can be a son of god or a daughter of god you had to be a part of god and god isn't complete without you he has to be that's right because there's one only one resource of eternal life and that's god and him alone has eternal life and you never were it and now and you were a part of him in so much you're an attribute or in his thinking in the beginning amen who is this melchizedek 65 221 paragraph 43 read on it god and morphe mask in the pillar of fire god in morphy in a man called jesus god and morphy in his church god above us god with us god in us the condescending of god the coming the condescending the lowering down the coming do you see one that i believe these things because i can read what he says and he said it was there it was god above us god with us now it's god in us the holy spirit not the third person the same person all right how about the next one god's provided place of worship 65 425 verb 91 in him dwells the fullness of the godhead bodily were we in there are sons and daughters of god sons and daughters to god no you out there if you don't hear that i'm reading it the way if the book says it so if they missed it okay but that's what the book says were we in there our sons and daughters of daughters to god in god's godhead yes remember he's not complete without us it's what he chose us to be it's not what we've made ourselves it's what he's chosen us to be okay go ahead to the next one 264. god's only provided place of worship no leaven among you that brings the entire fullness of the godhead bodily among you do we believe it well i kind of hate way i believe it because he said it well the bible never did teach a trinity and you believed it and i did too so we may be believing a lot of things that will look what he says no leaven among you that brings the entire fullness of the godhead bodily among you couldn't do it in luther's age couldn't do it in west ham couldn't do it in pentecostal but in today when the son of man will be manifested and we're going to deal with son of man for a minute reveal brought back the church together with the entire deity of god amongst his people son of man coming into bride and is into our deity amongst his people showing the same visible signs manifesting himself like he did at the beginning when he was manifested on earth in the form of a prophet god all glory promised by malachi 4 promised by the rest of the scripture where you worship at the house of god seated in present tense on to the next modern events made clear by prophecy 65 1206 burger 172 you were here in christ because he was the fullness of the word he was the fullness of the godhead to a bodily god was in christ reconciling the world to himself do you believe that look he was in christ then if you were in god a gene a word attribute from the beginning then you walk with him here on earth you talked with him on earth you suffered with him on earth you died with him at calvary and you rose with him again and now you're seating sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus communing with him the word as it feeds unto your soul that man shall live by every word that proceedeth how much more could a prophet say than what we talk about go ahead to the next one we would see jesus 1962 627 e71 now jesus now said what was that man who was he abraham ought to know abraham called him elohim is that right the self-existing god himself made flesh and showing that god in the light showing that god in the last days he said as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the coming of the son of man that god himself in the form of the holy ghost would be so into his church so filled till he'd be moving and operating in the church god in human fleshy doing the same thing right can we believe that the unveiling of god 1964 614 paragraph 270. notice then we then we become part of him as you are the veil that veils him you're part of him as long as christ is in you as christ was in god was of god because god was in him made him god and as christ is in you the hope of glory you become part of christ he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he also see you become part of christ as long as christ is hidden in you then it's veiled to the unbeliever but you know he's in you you are templing christ that's behind the veil the skin then we be behind because of this veil the veil again in human flesh hides god the word from the unbeliever right so we're ahead there's no way to see it i realized in 1969 when i preached the bride of jesus christ with the son of man there was nobody able to see what i was talking about if it wasn't revealed because how in the world could you talk about a people being the son of man the mighty god unveiled before us 1964 629 paragraph 120. he's talking about moses and jesus and the days no he was a living word to the people today jesus veiled is the living word to the people jesus in the church the holy ghost the son of god and the people revealing the word by the promise of this day makes it just exactly the same right what about it mighty god unveiled paragraph 147. and jesus said as it was in the days of sodom show silvia so shall it be at the coming of the son of man the deity veiled in human flesh now you know there's a lot of people believe that brother branham was deity veiled in human flesh as deity not just a part of the body of christ huh but now i don't believe that don't i believe that that new birth inside of him was deity but i believe the new birth inside of you is deity all right we'll go along with it like that see i believe in deity that way that every born-again believer is god in human flesh deity dwelling in human flesh i believe that so call me a deity that's what i believe but just remember you make brother random deity what did he say you do huh now remember jesus didn't say when the son of god is being revealed in luke the 17th chapter i believe in about the 20th 21st verse which is real 1730 somewhere along there he said and when the son of man is being revealed the son of man back in in in the church again revealed in human beings so it must not have been just brother branham right not son of god but the son of man again back in his church again in the last days we find that he promised that in god's promises all right look at the rapture paragraph 117. maybe i'm just talking another you'll get a lot of questions and we'll get to it now that's the age that we're living in right now the seventh church age that's all to be manifested in the grain of wheat at the end another comeback and once another comeback one for the son of man now if you take luke the 17th chapter and the 30th verse he said as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man when the son of man begins to reveal himself what is revealed make his revelation of what he is in this day are you reading it make his revelation of what he is in this day revealed out to the people the word that's made known for the day revealed to the people by the manifestation of the holy spirit making that jesus living among us all right what's the next one restoration of the bride tree paragraph 541 now you promised to do in the evening time you promised to do it in the last days he said and so shall it be in the coming of the son of man as it was in the days of light so will it be god living in human flesh among us in the form of his church in the only in the holy spirit performing the same sign in the form of this church yeah but i thought it was brother branham okay look at the next one sirs we would see jesus 1964 318 paragraph 161 jesus was god in flesh and if jesus is in you tonight it's still god manifest himself in the last days the son of man revealing himself in his church in the human flesh making himself known you get it see god down here in his church making himself again the word the son of man being revealed in the last days as it was in the days of sodom see we believed that brother randall wrote that but he was not the son of man but the bride of jesus christ is the son of man all right and watch him on the message called the trial priest of 1964 427 jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he's identified himself as he promised much more could we say in this last days as son of man making himself known among his people in the form of his people see not son of god not son of david but son of man the son of god was the supernatural i wrote it on up a little bit because 2 69. he said it was in the days of sodom so shall be in the coming of the son of god coming when the son of man shall be revealed a son of man being revealed not the son of god in the church age he's put out of that now he's son of man revealing himself the word is becoming flesh among us right look at the next one harvest time paragraph two or 354. in that day like luke 17 20 i believe it is jesus said when the son of man is being revealed not man the son of man not an organization the son of man the word living itself again among the people the word itself made flesh in you you are a reflection of this hour the message the re reflection of it see you live again live the life that's in jesus christ you're in the presence of the son all right what is it 3 54. a couple more then we'll and we'll get down to your question majority why did i believe this i believe what he said the anointed ones in the end time paragraph 260. now watch him explain what he's talking about in the very day that the son of man is revealed revelations 10 1-7 and we'll automatically put brother brown in there right read it when you get home the seventh angel's message opening up the seals what is it not the angel is the son of man but the messenger is revealing the son of man can you get it separated now that's where it seems to be so hard for you you see not the son of man himself but the seventh angel the seventh messenger is revealing to the public the son of man because it's left to shuck now what's after the shock the wheat right he can't organize it it's the grain itself all again look at the next one christ revealed in his own word paragraph 141 then he was made actually human flesh and dwelt among us in the person of jesus christ himself born of the virgin mary he come in that form so he could die and went back into heaven now this last days he has promised to manifest himself in the fullness again of his flesh in spirit see for as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man now look at this at sodom how it was set what taken place and jesus being manifested in bodily form of his church today see doing the same thing same work same things that he did all the time never changes eternal one the and upon earth today he has manifested itself in the human bodies our human bodies that he has called and done exactly the same thing he done in sundry times in the times of his flesh upon the earth all right let's see i've got one more let's go to the last one modern events make clear about prophecy paragraph 233 they'll get you questions and things ready comments or whatever jesus when he come he was to be a prophet that's right and today before jesus comes again the full manifestation of manifestation of the person of jesus christ is to be manifested in flesh that was brother branham now you just got through saying he was not the son of man all right think of it jesus said as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be at the coming son of man when the son of man is being revealed what is revealed unfolded made known the secret had been brought forth revealed in the day that the son of man will be revealed the world will be in a sodom condition we've got it haven't we yeah how many believes that it's in a sodom condition and that's exactly right look where it's sitting now so what do you think i conclude and think that by god joining himself to his church that he's made us to be what he's always wanted us to be this last day people are going to manifest him in his fullness not in one person no in the bride around the world she will be the word made flesh she will be the fullness of the godhead bodily upon earth again the grain of wheat that went into the ground is to return again the son of man the lord jesus christ that stood back there come down here through the prophet and on out into his bride and remember the prophet is part of the body of christ he was not the son of man he was a son of man but the bride all put together is the son of man the lord jesus christ deity living in us you see why i believe it you see why after all of these years i still believe it and i believe he's wanting us to realize who we are and what he has done for this age we haven't made ourselves anytime but it's what he's made us you know what he's made us him manifest there's your voice of the archangel to call the dead where he would be visible among us raise the dead and we'll go in the rapture it's all in him it's not in you and i it's what he said what he said he would do and you know what whether or not we believe it or what he's going to do it because he said he was it's our choice to decide whether or not we believe it or keep walking around horeb for 40 more years and too late folks most of us ain't got 40 years if they did they'd have to put us in a wheelchair and roll us around with a ventilator system hooked to us you know for us to live but you know what somebody's going to believe yeah but i thought this was going to happen i thought that was going to happen what about it i thought i assume i guess we think that god is going to change his ways to fit what we think that makes us pretty important don't it but why struggle to be all of that when all we got to do is just believe what he says do you know that your salvation is based totally on believing what god says everything is based upon what god says but do we believe it right as i said want to go do we believe by the new birth that he has given us it in our soul not in the body because we're always going to be a problem but in our soul we're just as eternal as god is do we believe that you know what if we believe that we'll quit looking out there and looking back there we'll start looking at what's right here we start looking at ourselves and saying look what he has done for me look what he has made me well um brother dale i guess i could believe that in a way but that's of course you ask somebody else's opinion and they're going to bring you a lot of quotes but that's why i gave you these when they start quoting you just lay these out and say would you read this and explain why the prophet said we were the fullness of the godhead bodily explain explain why the prophet said that we're deity veiled in human flesh amen that the son of man is god the seed the word living in a people see you're good about questioning me but what about everybody else when i put it out and tell you why i believe what i believe see church time is fastly running out on us well it's supposed to be this supposed to be that that could happen in the next hour we got a president and the vice president and if both of those get killed who is it this who speaker of the house if that gets killed who's the next one you know you could have a woman as president in two minutes from now because you keep coming down that ladder you know if it blowed up about where all them was at you come down the ladder she could be president the pope could die and it would probably take a little longer to vote in a new pope than it would a president but in a few days you could have a new pope coming out of the united states but you see we're waiting on things to happen when my point is trying to get you to see it could have already happened and we didn't know it amen what about some questions what about some thoughts and comments go ahead and get the microphone i've got one and i'll use it while he's getting ready to for you i made this statement a few times and then i'll read the comment or the thought said could you talk more about being in the wrong ranks will not be an excuse at the rapture i used to think this was being somewhere worldly but is this more sitting under or in a message church that is doubting or deluding the message they are not taking all the word now here's the here's the point the prophet said it it's taken from 371 a resume of the ages which coming out of the church age book has a lot to say about the things and they were given the food that come from idol worship bailey babylonian paganism wrapped up in christian terminology that very same spirit and doctrine is right amongst all protestants and it's called denomination nicolaitanism is organization humanizing the leadership of the church and thereby disposing the spirit you know doing away with the spirit human brain all right that's nickelodeonism that's why you got to conquer the laity balaamism is denominationalism which takes the church manual instead of the bible and right to this hour many of god's people are caught in the snare of denominationalism and god is crying to them come out of her my peace will let you be partakers of her sins as you receive not of her plagues you see they are ignorant but if the rapture should take place at this moment ignorance would be no court of appeal from the judgment of god for being in the wrong ranks wrong rights what about wrong ranks i said the military you just one whole step out you're okay cause you just you just move the whole rank but if you have a step out denominationalism being in the wrong ranks what about the people of this message would it not be wrong ranks to be taken what they're saying and the doctrines that they've preached would not not be wrong ranks and you can ignorantly sit there and think you're in the message let's bring it on down a little closer if we're sitting here in lula georgia and sympathizing with the message you need that quote from brother branham he said they sympathize with it to sympathize with something just to kind of go along with it and not fight against it right you sympathize with it you kind of pet the people that's why i always just tell you the way i stand and what i believe you can't say that i don't pity patter around i mean you can't say that i pity patter around to let you believe some great thing i try to tell you what it is but being at the wrong ranks is just flatly refusing to step into the word that is brought for the hour that we're living whether their answer could be then that wrong ranks what do you think about it you see we don't have no rights or thoughts to argue or bicker about things if this message is right then it's all right if not who's going to tell us what part of it is right and what part of it's wrong well that's where these brothers are doing it now they sure didn't do it when the prophet was alive and if the people of this message would just stand up and look them in the face and say that is not what the prophet said the two soul man was sitting down in augusta georgia years ago and the collie was there and brother dardy and my wife and husband my brother he made a statement said brother brown said so and so i said raise my hand said yeah i said red rhino didn't say that yes he did he said what i said brother you said to raise my hand if i had any question i won't know where he said it and this other brother that was there took it up and he said brother dale's right brother branham never said that he said well i'll make it my statement brother calling remember i told i said continue on that was his statement i didn't care but when he said brother brown said it when are we going to start doing that are we like a lot of them well that's his way of seeing it i didn't know they had a lot of ways of seeing things i thought there was one lord one faith one baptism so if that means if you're just got a whole bunch of opinions then father son holy ghost is okay then jesus name is okay and and three times backwards and three times forwards is okay and you see it's very serious this is life or death to me i don't know what you think about it so being in the wrong ranks is just simply walking one half a step out of the word just refusing something that is said at least you ought to have enough sense to be able when somebody says something say well you know read something to you i'll read to you these are fullness of the god everybody you or at least say well i just don't believe that you got hopes that way but when you say he was wrong then what hopes have we got that's what i mean wrong rights well everybody got to believe it your way the way it sounds brother dale i didn't say that we got to believe what the prophet said now you bring me any quote from anywhere in the prophet's message contrary to what i said tonight don't be silly i read all men there purposely we have the holy spirit by measure there is none of us has it by the fullness but put us all together and you got to fullness who be first what's your comments questions talks what do you think nobody has any comments any thoughts sister trudy sister trudy you know the worst thing about having a question won't ask it is having a question won't ask it the worst thing about having a question won't ask it is have a question and won't ask it right go ahead well you were reading where brother branham said why do we always refuse to believe who he says we are i know personally i feel that um to me it's a lack of patience god's patience to wait on him for the results signs and wonders yeah yeah and i know that's not important but that's that's my thoughts on it no problems with wanting signs and wonders because they will follow the word signs and wonders to believe the word that's where we mess up right if we can't believe it without having signs and wonders that's where we mess up i thought was supposed to believe what he's saying but it's constantly said the same the same life that he lived the same things he does exactly but we're expecting it too soon right when we want it no i was expected in 1969 when i preached it you know what i was expecting then i was expecting the church to start honoring glory hallelujah the bride of jesus christ is the son of man you know what i got same thing i'm getting right here tonight couldn't tell a thing in the world about what you believe so i have to not believe in signs and wonders now did you catch that because your signs and wonders is showing me you don't believe it right go ahead and see it there's an anointing that's supposed to come at the end right um is that what will bring the revelation of the rapture i believe in the anointing that comes in the end time will come the revelation of the rapture yes you know the prophet said she'd be waiting for the revelation i believe that there is a revelation that will take place and it'll be when the head unites with the body now what gets me in trouble is being too simple for people to follow what you're saying what was the revelation after the resurrection of the lord jesus that he told him to go tell everybody he's here he's risen he's here why would a prophet say he's here because he believed he was there you know what he was to him we're living under our privilege in the basis that we don't accept what is said i'll look for a time to come and there'll be such an outpouring of the holy spirit that will feel every fiber of our being and we'll go into rapture i'll look for that but if we're not in the right place there's your wrong ranks if we're not in the right place what good would it do for the anointing to fall if you're not pre-programmed and sitting there you know knowing the word of what it's supposed to be how would you know what it is because it's going to be falling on everything right and it's going to be a little while now i'm putting it all together it's going to be a little while that it's poured out on everything but then i do believe that there'll come a time just before that change that god's going to shut her down in everything but the bride i believe that i've always believed it that way that when that bride comes to that place and gets in her place he's going to shut her down and they won't be able to do nothing around the city of shore to the world for just a moment i'm looking forward to a lot of things but just don't miss what's going on because it won't do no good to get there it won't do it better good for us to get there if we don't know what to expect go back in your mind a minute to where you first heard of this message did you believe it right off no you fought it like crazy you know why because he's confused right amen but now somebody can read to you and we can go to the meetings and be somewhere and somebody will get up and say the bride is the fullness of the godhead bodily three-quarters of people going in the lula church in holland hey man why because we know that's true right right anymore brother brother how think about it but sam i reckon what i want to do in a ways testify first i want to tell you thank you for what you've been preaching thank you for all the series that you've preached here lately in that and in my following what you're preaching god has changed me completely i told you a while back i was ashamed of the way i'd lived because i've wasted so much time and hadn't gotten closer to god well i'm still ashamed but i'm a lot closer to god than i was then amen i was looking for miracles and this and that and the other but you know we can be looking for god to be doing one thing and he's trying his best to do something else that's better for us and we're missing and i'm talking from my experience but i have come to a place in the last year and a half two years i i don't know in the last period of time here that my outlook towards god has changed just decidedly i know what you're preaching is the truth and my word to anybody here including me especially to me is you better get every word that's coming across that pulpit because you mess around and miss it you might not make it and you know you're what you're saying we can sit right here and just kind of slough it off instead of taking it in and we're in the wrong ranks right we've got the wrong attitude towards the word of god god forgive me for that and help me to be more sincere and more dedicated than i've been being so just a real i've got a real desire just to pick up and he's he's feeding me i got fed in what you said tonight brother and i go home and go through these notes and listen again i'll get fed again and if i don't i won't and i say that to everybody here the main thing is that i wish you would do with the notes to show you how much i believe it and what he's saying i wish you would start the first one and you'd listen to that message the good shepherd of the sheep and i don't mean you got to do it in a certain order do you understand go down and listen to the next one see if what i've said is in continuity with all that said on that tape you're going to find a whole lot more than what i've said you're going to find it brother i haven't just let him finish one more comment the notes is what changed me i hit a place in the notes and i saw something as quick as i read through it god revealed it so i'll just give you that much testimony back in what you're saying about the notes get on they'll mean something to you amen uh i just wanted to say that this morning uh hank called me and we were talking and he was saying that we're nobody's perfect nobody no man is perfect and i said no i said but and i want you to correct me if i'm wrong that if we're striving for eternal life then we're striving for perfection right so that's what i told him and i just wanted to make sure that that was the right thing to have said to him so that was all i wanted to say and see if you have the new birth that is eternal life but there's a law and it's perfect and there's a lot of growing to be taking place in these old bodies that we are a lot of old self got to get out of the way and die to that that's just a kale this is not a great intelligence but it's not that we don't believe what you're saying it's just that the thought is a new thought it's like one god from trinity you know what i'm saying exactly and you don't just you don't just go into that and understand some people might but i'm not that way and you're the kind of preacher you are because of me i have to have it said to me over more than one time you know and we we have to let god deal with each person at their time right and like with me it's sometimes it's like god living in me how can i be so hateful how can i say this how can i feel this how can i think this god would live in that you know as a matter of fact i think i said that to myself today uh and then i think well it's not this body this flesh he's in my heart and in my soul right if i just let him take over exactly that's the problem that's the problem it's not we don't believe you but we and i know we may not have a lot of time but one thing i know about god his timing is perfect if we're going to be there we'll be there you know what i mean so don't get discouraged that we don't believe you because that's not the case it's just that some of us are slow-minded and i'm one of them okay okay who's next i know one time years ago the lord spoke to me and the only time that i've ever said anything about the statue of a perfect man of where i was or what was talking about it people are saying well brother dale i believe you're up here and somebody say i believe you're here so much that ain't gonna help you anyway but he spoke to me one day and he said if you'll have patience with the people because it'll prove you got patience well you can't argue that point you can't when he tells you you have patience with the people i know sometimes it gets hard and everything because i want you to see it but i know too what you're saying i know the reason that i'm not out on the field preaching i know that i understand that it's no problem i just know that the people don't understand what i'm trying to bring and i'm not talking about out on the field in the difference of that i'm talking about even in the people that closely related it just i just got to losing all and just people oh they're my brothers they love me but they don't understand me and i don't understand myself but i've got one goal in mind lord let me look out of hell and see you sitting in heaven and i'll be happy that's the only desire that i've got is for you to see the word who's that who got it no that's not nothing that's me i've done that 40 something years who's next anybody else like sister gayle's talking about we do things that we're ashamed of well i had my own blood brother hit me this week we were talking about raising children and he was talking about when he would get mad at his children and this and that and the other he said his wife would turn and turn and look at him and say what are you teaching think about it mm-hmm it'll be nice right anybody else you see just think about what god has given you and i the opportunity to hear what the bible says the prophets desire to look into but was not able to see it that's right take this little group of people here and put them out there among the people of the message and i get the comments back or somebody will say you go to church at lula well you know what that's that makes me feel good you're my kids and sometimes i get like a mean old daddy but i want to see you line up and do what's right but you remember one thing i was thinking about it when sister trudy was talking don't ever think that brother dale don't believe in signs and wonders you get that out of your mind i look for it i just don't put them first i never counted a new birth as to a time when i saw god in a church i never counted that a new birth i never counted because i come into this message a new birth i never counted because i've seen an angel in my home three different occasions i don't count none of that as a new birth because all of that can be imitated but the one thing that satan can't do is fight that word when you believe it when you believe it and it's revealed to you you watch that devil turn away from you brother kept saying something one time looking the other way and i just tapped him on the shoulder i said brother and i wouldn't arrogant hateful i said turn around and tell me you didn't say it he wasn't afraid of me he's afraid of what was because he knew that he said it to me and he wouldn't turn and do that so i'm not afraid of no devil nowhere because i know he can't handle the word just keep quoting it to him and he'll just have to back off he can't do nothing else come on musicians think on these things what do you believe brother dale i believe that we must recognize who we are and what we're doing and where we're at and we have the ability to do that because we have a message that has been brought to us to show who we are i believe in signs and wonders more than you do i don't mean that derogatory now i mean it disappointed i know myself you got to believe that you know yourself i never let that stand in my way i build it use it as a building stepping stone because i believe it why could you have so much confidence brother dale to say that your son wade would come back to the lord and that he would be standing in the pulpit beside of you because i believe what he tells me and you know why i believe that because i read in the bible one day a lot of you can remember real good but i can't i'll be glad to find it for you it says you'll be there with your offspring so isaiah awaits us i believe that you'll be there with your offspring i believe that that's greater than an audible voice can't be questioned because it's what god said don't need no signs and wonders to follow that but then they'll always be signs and wonder there'll always be something to prove it as i said i waited and waited until god come on the scene and brought to pass six times the dead raised among us many many different things that has happened among us that we have been there and witnessed and then you tell me i don't believe in signs and wonders i believe in manifestations of the holy spirit i believe the word comes first that way i can know where the manifestation's right or not because i got the scripture to stand on i'm dwelling on the scripture and it's not a question of what this is or what that is what do you say let's stand together can i say something you talk about signing one or whatever like that i hear that a lot a lot you know and people tell them what's happened in their lives and one day you know i come in here how long ago it was years two or three years ago trying to get you to help me find the scripture we found out it says you can speak with tongue of men no excuse me uh they said lord lord yeah he says we cast out demons in your name we've done many many wonderful works in your name now they've done that sure but they've never had a personal relationship right exactly exactly so that's you know who read for signs and wonders it doesn't you don't have to be saved to get here he heals lobster in fact that anybody's that is healed of anything a toothache whatever god here exactly i believe that exactly so science and wonders are great i enjoy seeing them but you can have signs and wonders and not have a personal relationship with the lord jesus christ exactly what was brother harris's faithful statement signs father believers believers don't follow signs right i was down with my eye you remember that i was out of church for a good while well i was laying on the bed and uh brother harrison uh several of them was was coming to give his communion right and when peggy said that uh they're here i was laying in bed i was almost dead i heard so bad and i can't tell you all the places but i went to i i put a repository on my rear end and god it hurt i mean i was in there trying to dig it out and uh i finally i said i can't receive him like this peggy i just can't and i come back in and laid on the bed and i started hyperventilating she thought i was fixing 92. and they came in in my bedroom sister michael was there too brook collie was there and uh they began to pray for me and i stopped hopping hyperventilating just come over and give me the wine i i mean the uh the bread and put it on my tongue and uh i don't know if i did the piggy did or he did i remember i was in that bad shape he gave me the wine and when that wine touched my tongue i can't tell you it was like a fire it was something hug it was something stopped here and all at once it just boom it was gone and i began to speak in tongues you know 15 20 minutes i guess but my point is this i couldn't sit down i was i was sitting on the side of the bed it would give me the the community and i couldn't stay it because i knew who it was talking i didn't ask for this i didn't ask to be able to do this he did it right and i knew that it was him talking i don't you see it i've had people say well did anybody interpret it he did himself he did it but my point is this on gifts in college you know if you're a true born again christian you know the truth of the matter you know who it is i mean it it ain't no i will hope spoke nothing you know who it is and then when i i walked over and my wife was right here and i and i and i blessed to started blessing in the name of lord jesus christ i mean i knew it wasn't me and i took my wife and i and i just kind of pulled up this way it's a blessing in the name of jesus christ and i started walking back to the people there was eight of us killing me and they was in the room and i i began to to walk to him the guys and and i hugged them and shook their hands and blessed him in the name of the lord well there was a brother there that thought that i was going to do that with the sisters i didn't i don't know why but but i i knew it i knew it and and when i come to the sisters i stuck my hand out and said bless you in the name of the lord jesus christ i come back i sat down on the edge of the bill over the foot of the bed and he began to speak again he said fear not you desire i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you and the last thing he said should be not afraid right that wasn't the end i think so when i i mean i was getting better all the time and i and i says brother sisters let's go down to the liver you know where i lived in duluth i said let's go down and i just had my warm-up pants on in a in a t-shirt and i was just weeping and as i started down the steps the sisters it was all around and i started god is my witness i started to take my shirt and wipe my face and i started before i broke to where the skin was at he jerked my hand back since down milk has seen it i don't know who else to see but he would not let me do that so i i'm telling you you know when god's on the scene you ain't got to guess about it right you know it gifts and wonders and colors god god does it himself and he backs it up exactly and you don't have to worry then that's right one comment i'd like to make about when this took place was that when dean started speaking and it was the lord interpreting the tongues it was his voice but it was not his mannerism i knew i knew who it was i knew i knew i mean i knew that it was going on i knew who it was that's why we believe signs and wonders and gifts and miracles we believe it because you know what the word said it'd be here everything just put it back in here you don't have to worry about it you put it back in here it'll be the right answer go ahead brother listen anybody have a need you have a need to alter it over i believe god is desiring to move among us in a mighty way i look forward to it every day if i pray a prayer for anybody and they don't get healed i don't blame them i blame myself and i say god what's wrong i bless your name i just have a prize uh today my friend you're reach out and praise and they will fall in jesus if you pray one more time before we go we bless your name i bless your name i give you honor i bless your name i bless your name some midnight let's just believe everything will be all right father in the name of jesus christ we send this prayer claw it's your presence your love and your manifestation will be there take care of this person in jesus name just sing it to one another as you leave and you're dismissed bless you everybody we'll bless your name
