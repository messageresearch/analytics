[1:14] up with brother Lis is what he was
[1:17] talking about this morning Sunday school
[1:19] is about that correction that we get and
[1:22] I mean when we get it from our father a
[1:24] real father it don't taste too good
[1:26] because it's all flesh but when it comes
[1:27] from our heavenly father that's supposed
[1:29] to reach weigh down and changes and I
[1:32] want to I want to say this just for what
[1:33] it's worth brother Bob preached a
[1:35] wonderful
[1:41] message me Wednesday night and for those

[1:56] night brought me back to Revelations 22
[1:58] and I sat there and I read and read it

[2:03] the
[2:04] Lord but
[2:06] today I'm telling you all of you if you
[2:08] get a chance to go back and listen to it
[2:10] listen to it because it's a wonderful
[2:11] message and we need to not let these
[2:13] messages not be unheard two or three
[2:15] times I know I have to listen to them
[2:17] several times just to get it so any
[2:20] morning anytime right now we're going to
[2:22] go ahead and just read the Bible
[2:24] revelations 12 1-15 and as we go to the
[2:27] Lord and ask his permission to open his
[2:29] word let's let's pray pray Heavenly
[2:31] Father we thank you for this day you've
[2:32] given us to come together around one
[2:34] more time around your word Lord and to
[2:36] be fed by your ministers here brother
[2:38] Aaron and brother Bob this afternoon I I
[2:41] pray Lord that you just open up their
[2:43] hearts and let those
[2:45] words a preparation Lord that you've
[2:47] given them to give to us to feed us that
[2:50] high protein food that we need Lord to
[2:52] stand on your word because we are the
[2:54] only light the little light that you've
[2:56] given us is that new birth and it needs
[2:58] to be Shone out into to the world and I
[3:00] know that people don't really understand
[3:02] us a lot of times Lord but you know what
[3:04] a smile on our face and Lord bless you
[3:06] helps them along their way and I just
[3:08] ask father that if there is any still
[3:11] out there that hadn't come yet I believe
[3:13] there is that we might be one of them to
[3:15] reach them I don't know Lord just have
[3:17] your way with us and use us forgive us
[3:19] of our sins Lord and I ask today that
[3:22] you just come down and bless the service
[3:23] and bless brother Wade and sister Jun
[3:25] and Mama they up there and visiting with
[3:27] those people in Brother Wilson's and I
[3:30] ask you just to bless brother Wade as
[3:31] he's bringing the Mana to them up there
[3:33] today and bless their journey and bring
[3:34] them back home safely and Lord just keep
[3:37] bringing us back lord till you get us
[3:39] right and have your way with us most of
[3:41] all and we ask these things and bless
[3:44] the opening and the reading of the word
[3:45] we ask it in your name Jesus Christ
[3:49] amen bear with me a minute
[3:56] here wherefore seeing we also are
[3:59] compass about was so great a cloud of
[4:02] witness let us lay aside every weight
[4:06] and the sin which do so easily beset us
[4:09] and let us run with a patience the race
[4:12] that is set before
[4:13] us looking unto
[4:16] Jesus
[4:23] ofing the
[4:25] shame down at the right of theone of God
[4:30] for consider him that endured such
[4:33] contradiction of Sinners against himself
[4:36] lest ye be wearied and faint in your own
[4:40] minds you have not resisted unto
[4:46] blood and ye have forgotten the
[4:48] exhortation which speaketh unto you as
[4:51] unto children my son despise not thou
[4:54] thy chastising of the Lord nor faint
[4:57] when thou art rebuked of him
[5:00] For Whom the
[5:03] he every he
[5:07] receive if ye endure chastising god
[5:10] dealth with you as Sons for what son is
[5:14] he whom the father has chastised us
[5:17] not you without
[5:20] Chas
[5:24] All
[5:26] Sons furthermore we have had fathers of
[5:29] our flesh which corrected us and we gave
[5:32] them reverence shall we not much rather
[5:34] be in subjection unto the father of
[5:37] spirits and
[5:40] live
[5:45] days
[5:46] foret we might be
[5:51] of now no chastising for the presence
[5:54] seems to be joyous but Grievous
[5:56] nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the
[5:59] Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto
[6:01] them which are exercised
[6:04] thereby wherefor lift up the hands which
[6:07] hang down and
[6:10] thees and make straight pass for your
[6:13] feet lest that which is lame be turned
[6:16] out of the way but let it rather be
[6:20] healed peace with all men
[6:23] in without no man shall see the Lord
[6:28] looking diligently lest any man fail of
[6:31] the grace of God lest any root of
[6:34] betterness spring up trouble to you and
[6:38] thereby may be defiled thank you for the
[6:41] open the word you may be
[6:52] seated amen thank you
[6:56] Jesus amen thank the Lord for that word

[20:51] to you in the name of Jesus Christ we
[20:54] pray amen amen John chapter 15 and
[20:58] beginning at verse one and it says I am
[21:02] the True Vine and my father is the
[21:05] husbandman every branch in me that
[21:08] beareth not fruit he taketh away and
[21:10] every branch that beareth fruit he
[21:12] purgeth it that it may bring forth more
[21:15] fruit now ye are clean through the word
[21:18] which I have spoken unto you amen abide
[21:21] in me and I in you as the branch cannot
[21:25] bear fruit of itself except it abide in
[21:27] the Vine no more can ye except ye abide
[21:30] in me I am the vine and ye are the
[21:33] branches he that abideth in me and I in
[21:36] him the same bringeth forth much fruit
[21:39] for without me he can do
[21:41] nothing if a man abide not in me he is
[21:44] cast forth as a branch and is withered
[21:47] and Men gather them and cast them into
[21:50] the fire and they are burned if ye abide
[21:53] in me and my words abide in you ye shall
[21:56] ask what ye will and it shall be done
[21:59] unto you herein is my father glorified
[22:02] that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be
[22:05] my disciples amen God bless you this
[22:08] morning you may be
[22:10] seated and uh my titled is energized by
[22:14] the True
[22:16] Vine
[22:18] and I was looking at some things and you
[22:22] know I'm I I get everybody have all
[22:26] ministers have a different way of of
[22:28] studying and and doing different things
[22:30] and I get I get thoughts and ideas and I
[22:32] put them together and I was talking to
[22:35] brother Aon McGary one time and I told
[22:37] him I said the one thing that I have
[22:38] trouble with is trying to come up with a
[22:39] with a title for my
[22:43] sermons sometimes I got a sermon
[22:45] together and I don't know what to call
[22:46] it and he told me so well maybe you just
[22:48] send it to me give me your idea and I'll
[22:50] give you a good title because I always
[22:52] said brother Aon if you ever listen to
[22:54] brother Aaron mcgary's titles it's like
[22:56] I don't know what he's going to preach
[22:57] on but we know it's going be good he
[23:00] just has a way of of labeling and uh but
[23:04] this morning I want to look at this and
[23:06] I was thinking about what
[23:08] brother uh brother Quinn was talking
[23:11] about and he was he was talking about
[23:13] the True Vine and the false Vine and uh
[23:16] I had just been been looking at this and
[23:18] that's the reason I entitled it
[23:20] energized by the True Vine
[23:25] and so here brother randam says in the
[23:28] in the message the Queen of
[23:30] Sheba he said he's the vine John chapter
[23:33] 15 he said where are the branches now he
[23:35] said the vine does not bear fruit the
[23:37] branch bears fruit as it's energized by
[23:40] the vine and if the first Branch out of
[23:44] that vine produced a church that wrote a
[23:46] book of Acts the second Branch would do
[23:48] the same thing every branch that comes
[23:51] out of that vine will be energized by
[23:53] the same life that's in the vine
[23:57] amen so that's what I want to I want to
[23:59] look at this morning and because he said
[24:02] I am the vine and ye are the branches my
[24:05] father is the
[24:07] husbandman and so I I want to look at
[24:09] this word the word energize it means to
[24:13] give vitality and enthusiasm to it means
[24:17] the power or the ability of something to
[24:21] continue to live or to give the power of
[24:24] life to to be or to be
[24:27] successful now now the word Vitality
[24:30] means to the power of giving continuance
[24:34] of
[24:34] life and the word enthusiasm means one
[24:38] of the definitions means belief and
[24:41] special Revelations of the Holy Spirit
[24:44] now some of those that got to listen if
[24:47] you've had the opportunity to listen to
[24:49] uh the Youth Camp from Ohio from uh
[24:53] brother uh Wayne Lawson's Camp um
[24:57] brother Andrew Glover preached a really
[24:59] good message about don't lose your
[25:01] enthusiasm and one of the things that
[25:04] that brother Andrew brought out that I
[25:05] thought was really good that tied in
[25:07] with this is that brother Andrew was
[25:09] talking about if you go back a hundred
[25:11] or more years ago the word en enthusiasm
[25:14] only was tied to the scripture was tied
[25:17] to the revelation of the word enthusiasm
[25:20] did not mean what we think it means
[25:21] today it actually meant and when you go
[25:24] back and look and he brother Andrew
[25:26] brought that out and I was like I
[25:27] actually wouldn't looked up in the
[25:28] dictionary and sure enough that's what
[25:29] it means amen it meant special
[25:32] Revelation it brings power and
[25:35] enthusiasm comes from the scripture amen
[25:38] and we've taken that and brother Bram
[25:39] said that's what he said brother Bram
[25:41] said the church has lost its
[25:43] enthusiasm why because they've got mixed
[25:45] with everything else and they've not
[25:48] went to the scripture but that's where
[25:50] you get your power you get your um
[25:53] energy Your vitality lifegiving the only
[25:57] lifegiving for there is comes from the
[26:01] scripture he said that he is the way the
[26:04] truth and life he is the only way that
[26:06] you can make it he is the light he is he
[26:09] is all that you have need of comes
[26:11] through the scripture comes through him
[26:14] and it says to energize means it's a
[26:18] strong excitement or a
[26:20] feeling and to
[26:22] energize means to get something from
[26:26] energy it has comes from energy energy
[26:29] means a vigorous exertion of power it
[26:32] means power strength Force the ability
[26:35] or capacity to Pro produce an
[26:38] effect so when we talk about having the
[26:41] to be energized by the Holy Spirit to
[26:44] have this energy this Force this power
[26:47] there's only one power in the world and
[26:51] that's Jesus Christ God's the only Power
[26:54] everything else is permitted power we
[26:56] realize that everything else God allows
[26:59] things to happen but he's in control the
[27:01] only one that's leading this and has
[27:03] power over is him is God is the one
[27:06] that's in control he has the force he
[27:08] created all things and everything is
[27:10] under his control and nothing takes
[27:13] place that he doesn't know
[27:15] about so uh I just want to look at this
[27:18] this morning now we know brother Bram
[27:20] was speaking one time and he was
[27:22] speaking about how in the
[27:25] beginning he was speaking of God and he
[27:28] said that in the beginning God was the
[27:31] father he was the vine and he goes on to
[27:34] talk about that Jesus was the
[27:38] branch now if you go back into the book
[27:40] of uh in Jeremiah and U believe in
[27:44] Isaiah in the book of Jeremiah talks
[27:46] about the branch of that he would put
[27:48] forth A A righteous branch and bring
[27:51] forth a king there was a there was a
[27:54] prophecy made and that prophecy was made
[27:57] and the person that was that was the
[27:59] Messiah that was a Prophecy of the
[28:01] Messiah and brother R says see he was
[28:03] the he was the branch to Bear the fruit
[28:06] of God he said now he becomes the vine
[28:10] and we become the
[28:12] branch he said and all that God was he
[28:15] he poured into Christ he said but listen
[28:18] all that was in Christ was poured into
[28:21] the church he said the works that I do
[28:24] shall ye do also more More Than This
[28:28] shall you do for I go to my father you
[28:31] see we are living under our god-given
[28:34] privileges that God has redeemed us to
[28:38] so we know that he started out as the
[28:41] the vine or I'm sorry as the branch
[28:44] because he was the one that came he
[28:46] condescended come in flesh and began to
[28:49] manifest what the word and he said as we
[28:52] read here in a little bit that when
[28:54] Jesus came he said I can do nothing in
[28:57] myself except what the father shows me
[28:59] he said that's the the son likewise so
[29:02] the son was doing Jesus done exactly
[29:05] what the father showed him to do and
[29:07] that's the only thing that he became to
[29:08] manifest because when he began to speak
[29:10] to the disciples and tell them he said
[29:13] they were looking he said let show us
[29:15] the father he said have I been so long
[29:16] with you that have You' not seen the
[29:18] father so that's what his job was to was
[29:21] to manifest the father to show them God
[29:24] that was God before
[29:26] them and so see we have been redeemed to
[29:29] this we've been redeemed to this place
[29:31] that you and I have been placed into
[29:34] this into this bride into the body and
[29:37] so we have become the branch that's come
[29:40] off the vine he said I am the vine
[29:43] you're the branches and he said you
[29:45] bring forth fruit amen and so as he
[29:49] began to do this he said say we we live
[29:50] below our god-given privileges that God
[29:53] has redeemed us to that's right so all
[29:56] all the Redemptive blessing are yours
[29:58] and mine this morning we have we have
[30:00] been sitting set in Heavenly places in
[30:03] Christ Jesus and he said brother Ram
[30:05] said he said what did Christ redeem us
[30:07] for did he ever did you ever think what
[30:11] he redeemed us
[30:13] for why didn't he just make you the
[30:16] atonement say there's no need of giving
[30:19] them deep Powers there's no need in
[30:23] making this man a Son of God there's no
[30:25] need in doing that I would just ask him
[30:28] to believe it and write his name on The
[30:30] Book Of Heaven that'll settle
[30:32] it but he gave these redeem redeemed
[30:36] blessings that we might operate the work
[30:39] of God by the energy of the Holy Spirit
[30:43] he said St John 15 says he said I am the
[30:46] vine and ye are the branches do you know
[30:49] that the vine can't bear fruit although
[30:52] the fruit is in the vine but the fruit
[30:56] cannot be brought forth from from a Vine
[30:59] it has to have the branch to Bear the
[31:01] fruit he said and you are the branches
[31:04] now the Vine with all its energy now
[31:07] listen this the Vine with all its energy
[31:09] cannot produce anything unless the
[31:11] branch is willing to receive the
[31:14] energy he said now God is depending on
[31:17] you as a member of his body to bear
[31:20] fruit of his
[31:22] spirit and now if he's depending on you
[31:26] let's open up our Channel Chels and let
[31:29] the Holy Spirit come in tonight and
[31:31] energize us and free us from all these
[31:34] fears and doubts so we have to realize
[31:37] that God has given us something and you
[31:40] know what the the opportunity has been
[31:42] set before us and we have been made to
[31:46] this position God has opened it up for
[31:48] us and the only thing is is do you allow
[31:51] God to work in your life because he said
[31:54] you know he said we live below our
[31:55] god-given privileges here we are this
[31:57] morning sitting here and God has given
[31:59] us all that we have need of and and
[32:02] blessed us to be here and all these
[32:04] things but you know what we live below
[32:05] what God has given us we walk in such a
[32:08] defeated State come
[32:11] on come on
[32:13] brother but you know I I I you know
[32:16] because if you understand that that when
[32:19] you when you're living in in the in the
[32:21] power that you have what what you have
[32:24] that what you've been given by the new
[32:26] birth yeah if you realize who you are
[32:29] this morning and what you have then you
[32:31] can claim what belongs to you this
[32:33] morning you can you can walk in all
[32:35] these things that God has given you you
[32:37] don't have to worry about you know it's
[32:39] like well I I I I want to know if if if
[32:42] if this if God will allow me to do this
[32:44] or or do that or or can I get healed or
[32:47] any of these things but you know it's
[32:49] just like as brother Bob was preaching
[32:50] Wednesday night see when you come back
[32:52] to realize that you you know because the
[32:54] message has brought a restoration and by
[32:57] the restoration has brought you back to
[32:59] the place that you should have
[33:01] been so if you if you've received that
[33:04] restoration then you say well I'm not
[33:05] where I ought to be well praise God the
[33:07] restoration is in progress and the power
[33:10] is still there to bring you back to the
[33:12] place where you ought to
[33:13] be because just like that sister said
[33:16] that morning he she stood up and said I
[33:18] want to say one thing said I'm not what
[33:20] I ought to be but let me tell you what
[33:22] I'm not what I used to be thank you Lord
[33:26] well because she could see something had
[33:27] Tak place and realize that she's come
[33:30] somewhere right amen see it's the same
[33:34] way with you and
[33:37] I see the devil wants to tell you well
[33:40] you're not you're not anything and
[33:42] you're not going to make anything and
[33:44] and you know all these things the devil
[33:46] likes to tell you and try to put in your
[33:47] in your path and in your mind well you
[33:49] know what if he's talking to you you
[33:51] know it's a
[33:53] lie true brother because the truth's not
[33:56] in him
[33:59] yeah but he
[34:02] says brother man says here he
[34:05] says see he said a little while and the
[34:08] world will see me no
[34:09] more when he came he said the been
[34:12] speaking to the disciples he said a
[34:14] little while and the world will see me
[34:15] no more he said he said the world order
[34:18] he said they will see me no more yet ye
[34:20] shall see me he said that's the elected
[34:23] the church he said for I will be with
[34:26] you even in you to the end of the the
[34:27] world Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[34:30] today and forever The Works that I do
[34:32] shall ye do also he said do you believe
[34:35] that he said the Church of he said the
[34:38] Church of Christ is the branch and it
[34:40] says if you go to the branch and you
[34:42] don't find the fruit of the vine then
[34:44] there's something wrong it isn't the
[34:46] branch Christ Jesus but if it is in the
[34:50] branch Christ Jesus it'll bear the
[34:53] fruits of
[34:55] Christ because he was he was the the
[34:59] branch that was in the vine and what he
[35:03] done was he brought
[35:04] forth exactly what the father had amen
[35:08] because he was because he said he said
[35:10] search the scriptures and them you think
[35:12] you have eternal life and they are they
[35:14] that testify of me so show me where I
[35:17] didn't fulfill the
[35:19] scripture as he began to speak and walk
[35:21] and he said look all the things that had
[35:23] been written of him he said that's
[35:25] exactly what he fulfilled he he walked
[35:27] and as he went forward everything that
[35:29] that was spoken of him was made manifest
[35:32] and he went back and he began to talk
[35:33] about the scripture and he said well how
[35:35] is it that that that when they began to
[35:37] talk about the the uh prophets and and
[35:39] things the prophecies that were made and
[35:41] he went back and he pointed out the
[35:43] scriptures and began to lay them out and
[35:46] show them what the what the Fulfillment
[35:48] of the scripture was right just like
[35:51] when when they asked him about about
[35:54] John the
[35:55] Baptist he said Elias truly shall come
[35:58] and restore all things but I tell you
[36:00] he's already coming you didn't know him
[36:02] right and then oh we that's John the
[36:06] Baptist see they couldn't believe they
[36:08] couldn't believe that that he came is
[36:10] there anything ever come any good thing
[36:12] ever come out of
[36:15] Nazareth well where's that where's that
[36:17] in the Old Testament that a king that a
[36:18] messiah is coming out of
[36:21] Nazareth but but they didn't realize
[36:24] that he was born in Bethlehem according
[36:26] to the scripture right but the scripture
[36:29] said that he would be a
[36:31] Nazarene but see some of those
[36:32] scriptures people didn't actually
[36:34] believe those scriptures ever spoke of
[36:35] the
[36:37] Messiah it's like well I don't you know
[36:40] I don't see that as as the Messiah
[36:41] because but it took it took the prophecy
[36:45] it took the word to reveal that and show
[36:49] that that that was what what was meant
[36:51] by the prophecy amen that's right when
[36:54] he went back and everybody's like we see
[36:56] they that's the reason the Jews doesn't
[36:57] don't always see and we understand that
[37:00] that they're blinded in the day that
[37:01] we're in the hour we live because God
[37:03] blinded their eyes but you know they
[37:05] don't see those things why because the
[37:06] light has never shown on that that the
[37:08] scriptures that are written in the
[37:09] scripture actually speak of the
[37:12] Messiah and that's the reason many times
[37:14] that they stand up and and deny that
[37:16] Jesus Christ is the Fulfillment of the
[37:18] word is because those scriptures don't
[37:21] don't because when what they see in the
[37:23] scripture in the Old Testament does not
[37:25] speak of the Messiah
[37:28] but in the New Testament you go back and
[37:30] read those scriptures and they go back
[37:32] just like he said out of out of Zion out
[37:35] of Egypt I called my
[37:37] son amen see they don't see the duality
[37:40] of the
[37:42] scripture but in the Fulfillment of that
[37:44] then it says that it may be fulfilled of
[37:47] what was
[37:48] written see it takes the opening of the
[37:50] word the Holy Spirit has to Quicken the
[37:53] word and the opening of the word
[37:59] see Jesus said verily verily I say unto
[38:02] you he saidthe son can do nothing in
[38:05] himself but what he sees the father
[38:07] doing he said for whatsoever things the
[38:09] father doeth that doeth the son likewise
[38:13] and he'll show you greater than this
[38:15] that you might Marvel he said the father
[38:18] worketh and I worketh hither
[38:21] too and he's speaking of see the the son
[38:24] began to do the things exactly that was
[38:27] spoken of him that he would do and he
[38:29] began to walk and he walked in a realm
[38:31] of perfect Faith because he saw the
[38:33] things that the father showed him to do
[38:34] and he just he just done exactly what
[38:36] the father showed him to do and he was
[38:38] walking in the realm of perfect faith
[38:40] and he said see he said the things that
[38:42] I do ye shall do
[38:45] also he said and greater than this for I
[38:48] go to my father he said is that true he
[38:50] said if ye abide in me and my word abide
[38:52] in you ask what you may and it'll be
[38:55] given he said that's either right or
[38:58] wrong Hallelujah so it's either
[39:01] correctly what he said because that's
[39:03] what he was saying here in the
[39:05] scripture he said that you're going to
[39:07] bring forth this fruit and you're going
[39:09] to and these are the things that are
[39:11] promised to you that you're going to
[39:13] bring forth much fruit amen but as you
[39:16] bring forth this fruit he said every
[39:18] tree that brings every Branch that's
[39:19] bringing forth fruit he said it's going
[39:21] to be purged that it brings forth more
[39:24] fruit right and he said and he said he
[39:27] said herein is the father glorified that
[39:30] you may bring forth much fruit so
[39:33] there's many things that you have to go
[39:34] through and you know as we were speaking
[39:36] of last time you know when everybody
[39:39] talks about you know wanting to have you
[39:41] know wouldn't it be great if we had them
[39:43] you know the experiences that brother
[39:44] brandham had and we had all these things
[39:46] we could see what brother brandham saw
[39:47] and all these typ things and you know as
[39:49] we were talking you know brother
[39:51] brandham but there's a lots of times
[39:52] that brother bram's experiences when you
[39:54] go back and look there were lots of
[39:55] times brother brandham didn't didn't
[39:56] know anything he's like brother he said
[39:58] God I don't
[40:00] understand and he's stand there he said
[40:02] Lord I'm just walking by
[40:04] faith and everybody thinks well you know
[40:07] the Lord just woke brother brandom up
[40:09] every morning and just showed him
[40:10] everything and he got to see you know
[40:11] the the clouds parted and he just had
[40:13] these great these great Revelations
[40:15] these Visions just broke all the time
[40:16] and he saw everything well he didn't
[40:19] show brother Brandon everything there's
[40:21] a lot of times that brother BR didn't
[40:23] understand things even when people come
[40:25] and asked him you know they would bring
[40:26] him qu uh dreams and and different
[40:29] things they had questions for and
[40:30] brother brown stand there saying I don't
[40:34] know but he had to go through the exact
[40:37] same thing that you and I go through and
[40:39] people it would be wonder you know if we
[40:41] just had brother brandom but you know
[40:42] what the same God that was in brother
[40:44] brandham is here today but you know what
[40:46] you and I have to walk by faith it's the
[40:50] same it's the same thing that brother
[40:51] brandham
[40:53] done so it's the same it's say you go
[40:55] through the same thing that he would
[40:58] do so here as we walk through this
[41:02] way he said and Jesus said brother said
[41:06] he said that Jesus said that he would
[41:08] come back and be with us he resurrected
[41:11] from the dead lives among men tonight
[41:14] working in his church and he said and
[41:15] the real tree believing Church sees
[41:18] Jesus the same yesterday today and
[41:20] forever now if Jesus was here on Earth
[41:23] tonight in a physical body like I am
[41:26] he's in the form of the Holy Spirit God
[41:28] took his body and sat on the right hand
[41:30] and glory on the throne and sent the
[41:32] spirit back as a covenant to the people
[41:36] he said and we're sealed by that Holy
[41:38] Spirit baptism which gives us a touch of
[41:41] God's life in US Zoe the life of God in
[41:45] us he said now we become the sons of God
[41:48] that makes you believe no matter what
[41:51] that's God's word I believe it we
[41:54] believe it so if the same life that was
[41:57] in you and I that was in him it's the
[42:01] same
[42:02] life as we are the
[42:05] branch and we bring forth the life from
[42:07] the vine then he says if we yield
[42:10] ourselves to that then as it brings
[42:12] forth the life that's in there will
[42:14] produce exactly what it's supposed to do
[42:17] because we see it does the exact same
[42:19] thing he said see when he was here he
[42:22] was a branch also so he brought exact he
[42:25] brought forth exactly what he was
[42:26] supposed to manifested exactly what was
[42:29] that was that was spoken of him that he
[42:31] would do that he said God was in him and
[42:34] he said God's in us and he said it's the
[42:36] vine he said what will the vine do he
[42:39] said the vine per furnishes the energy
[42:41] to the branches he said is that right
[42:45] and he said and the branches bears fruit
[42:48] so if he's bringing forth the fruit just
[42:50] like he did previously and we do the
[42:52] exact same thing then he said just as
[42:54] when Jesus was here he said you are his
[42:58] hands you are his mouth right he said he
[43:01] said he has no other hands but your
[43:03] hands he has no other eyes but your eyes
[43:05] he has he has no the life our life is
[43:08] his life he said he puts his life in us
[43:11] he said we live the life that we would
[43:13] live
[43:14] it if he was here on the earth in a
[43:17] physical form so the same life that he
[43:21] would live is in
[43:23] you the same life that he would live if
[43:26] he was here because it was the same life
[43:28] that he lived previously when he was
[43:29] here in a physical form and he said if
[43:31] he was here in a physical form then we
[43:33] would live the same life he said while
[43:36] the body is sitting at the right hand of
[43:38] God making intercessions he said oh
[43:40] isn't that isn't that
[43:42] beautiful so you understand that when
[43:45] he's talking about the life that was in
[43:47] him it's the same life and it'll do
[43:49] exactly what it what it set out to do
[43:52] what it done in the beginning it'll do
[43:54] today so the same life that if Jesus
[43:57] Christ was here in a physical form and
[43:59] he was walking on the on the Earth right
[44:01] now that life what it would do would do
[44:03] the same thing in you and I he said he
[44:06] said oh isn't that beautiful he said
[44:09] that just knocks all the kings out of
[44:11] unbelief to me he said it just makes it
[44:14] so
[44:15] real to understand the same life that
[44:18] was in Jesus Christ 2,000 years ago if
[44:21] it's in you this morning it'll do the
[44:23] exact same thing amen amen and the only
[44:27] thing that you have to do is you have to
[44:29] yield yourself to
[44:32] that how how wonderful to realize who we
[44:35] are that we have the life of the
[44:37] branch he said he said if we understand
[44:39] he said we he said what did the vine
[44:43] what did the vine
[44:44] do when it put forth a
[44:48] branch see when Jesus came and and he
[44:50] walked on the face of the Earth and he
[44:52] began to speak to the disciples and he
[44:54] began to tell them what was going to
[44:55] take place they walked for three three
[44:57] and a half years hearing this message
[44:59] and as as he began to speak to him and
[45:01] he began to tell them what was going to
[45:02] take place and then he told him he said
[45:05] but he said but T in Jerusalem till you
[45:07] be endued with power from on high
[45:09] because you know what he preached them
[45:11] the word he taught them the word he swed
[45:12] the word in them but you know what it
[45:14] come to a time when the Holy Spirit came
[45:16] and it quickened the word that they held
[45:18] and you know what it brought forth
[45:20] exactly what took place on the day of
[45:22] Pentecost is exactly what was the same
[45:24] life that was in Jesus Christ became
[45:27] born in
[45:28] 120 and they began to do exactly the
[45:31] same thing that's it when they walked
[45:33] out there and they thought they were
[45:34] drunk men but you know what they
[45:36] realized that those men had been with
[45:37] Jesus when those women had been with
[45:39] Jesus the exact same thing came forth
[45:42] and was brought was manifested exactly
[45:44] what was said was going to take place
[45:46] when when Peter and the 11 walked out
[45:48] there that morning he said these men
[45:49] aren't drunk as you suppose s it's the
[45:52] third hour of the day but he said this
[45:53] is that that was spoken of by the
[45:55] prophet Joel he said I will pour out my
[45:58] spirit on All Flesh and then they began
[46:00] to prophesy and tell them what would
[46:02] take place and when they began to tell
[46:04] them what would take place then they
[46:06] went back and told him said listen this
[46:08] is what the prophets had said this is
[46:10] what David had said in the Psalms and he
[46:12] began to bring that straight out and
[46:14] began to un to make them understand to
[46:17] understand that the life of Jesus Christ
[46:19] the ministry that Jesus had what y'all
[46:21] had just seen in a man that that y'all
[46:23] thought it was be above and everything
[46:25] but this was the Fulfillment of that
[46:27] scripture and they began to explain to
[46:29] them exactly what took place all the way
[46:31] through the scripture and then when they
[46:33] began to hear that then they were
[46:34] pricked in their hearts and they said
[46:35] men and Brethren what shall we do to be
[46:40] saved would just pick up your your uh
[46:44] your Cloud
[46:46] picture make sure you get a Bell
[46:50] Buckle tow around some message
[46:53] books come on and if you wear your hat
[46:56] make sure you to it on the
[46:58] side and drive a
[47:04] Ford but now what did they
[47:07] say well wear your robe like Jesus done
[47:10] whatever jesus' favorite fruit we're
[47:11] going to eat the same fruit that Jesus
[47:13] did we're going we're going to dress and
[47:15] walk just like
[47:17] Jesus amen
[47:20] hallelujah but it wasn't
[47:22] impersonation right it was a
[47:25] manifestation that's right right they
[47:27] weren't trying to impersonate Jesus it
[47:29] was a manifestation of Jesus why because
[47:32] it was what's on the inside that came
[47:35] out and he said what we must be he said
[47:37] you must repent and be baptized in the
[47:39] name of Jesus Christ for remission of
[47:41] sin and you shall receive the gift of
[47:44] the Holy Spirit not just trying to not
[47:47] trying to put on a an act or anything
[47:49] but it was the manifestation of the same
[47:52] life right right it was a manifestation
[47:54] of what was on the inside that began to
[47:57] be manifested on the outside and brother
[47:59] Bram said see he said when that first
[48:01] Branch put forth he said they put out it
[48:03] would became the Pentecostal
[48:05] Church in the beginning he said in that
[48:08] same Pentecostal church he said now if
[48:09] the second Vine the second Branch does
[48:11] the same thing and he said they wrote a
[48:13] book of Acts behind the first Branch the
[48:16] first Pentecostal church he said if it
[48:18] brings forth the second Branch he said
[48:20] then they'll write another book of Acts
[48:22] behind
[48:24] it he said we don't see but he said the
[48:28] problem is that people don't believe in
[48:30] Pentecostal he said they don't believe
[48:31] in having Pentecostal in the churches
[48:33] anymore he said he said well what is it
[48:35] he said it's a grafted
[48:38] Vine he said they're grafted in but he
[48:40] said they're not living off the original
[48:42] they're living off the original life but
[48:43] it's not the original
[48:45] Branch he said he said because they've
[48:47] grafted in the men's ideas and men's
[48:50] thoughts and everything he said but when
[48:52] that Branch puts when that vine puts
[48:54] forth an a bran original branch he said
[48:57] it'll bring forth the exact same thing
[48:59] he said it'll match just like it did in
[49:01] the
[49:04] beginning see one of the things that
[49:07] people were talking about was when when
[49:08] they talk about oh look look at all the
[49:10] the great things that they done the
[49:12] Miracles the signs and the Wonders but
[49:14] the problem is is one of the things that
[49:16] they miss when they when they talk about
[49:17] that first Branch when it put forth you
[49:19] know what they were rejected they were
[49:22] despised everybody came against them you
[49:25] know what they didn't have it they
[49:26] didn't have it a real easy way of going
[49:29] why because there was there was God God
[49:32] had a way and they said if if they
[49:33] treated Jesus the same way he said then
[49:36] they done them the same way and he said
[49:37] they'll do you the same way they were
[49:40] rejected they they were despised they
[49:42] were
[49:44] hated they done the exact same thing to
[49:47] Jesus and that's exactly the same way if
[49:49] you bring forth the same thing then it's
[49:51] going to be the same
[49:53] way they they don't want the truth they
[49:56] don't want to hear what the truth is the
[49:59] truth is rejected they want they want to
[50:01] just have their own
[50:03] ideas they just want to have something
[50:05] that's you know simil or uh easy but
[50:10] it's not
[50:12] easy it's a hard way to
[50:15] go but he said see but you're energized
[50:18] by the by the Light that's in the vine
[50:20] he said it'll bring forth his spirit
[50:22] will bring forth his Works he said if
[50:24] you're in Christ he said it's got to
[50:28] because it's the vine of
[50:29] God he said he said now watch what kind
[50:32] of nature it brings he said it brings
[50:34] forth the same fruit it did when it was
[50:37] here it's back in the church bringing
[50:40] bearing forth the same fruit making
[50:42] another Pentecostal church just the
[50:44] exactly the same it did the first time
[50:48] he said now that church sealed their
[50:50] testimony with their blood they were
[50:53] godly people they love God they stayed
[50:55] with it right amen and it's the same way
[50:59] it's the same thing that you and I have
[51:01] to go through just like they did they
[51:03] sealed their testimony with their own
[51:04] blood but you know it brought them
[51:07] through and so it's the same way with
[51:09] you and I it's the
[51:11] same
[51:13] battle you're going to be rejected and
[51:16] despised but you know I want to take my
[51:18] way with the Lord's despise
[51:20] few just the same way as they
[51:23] did see when you see that when when God
[51:26] brought you see you come to this place
[51:29] and just as they did you come the same
[51:31] way that they done you come through
[51:34] this justification sanctification the
[51:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost to bring you
[51:39] into the same place that they came to
[51:41] it's the same work of the Holy Spirit
[51:44] God called you wherever you came from
[51:46] brought you out of whatever you were in
[51:48] and he said he brought you and he called
[51:49] you into this and you know you responded
[51:52] to that call there because there was a
[51:55] day that God had that because you were
[51:57] one of his that you know what the word
[51:59] was going to cross your path one of
[52:00] these one day and you know what the
[52:02] light struck your path and you know what
[52:04] you saw who you were amen because you
[52:06] know I I realized one day when I when I
[52:09] was out in the world and I was enjoying
[52:11] myself but you know there come a time
[52:12] you know that didn't that didn't have
[52:13] any enjoyment for me
[52:16] anymore you know what I be I don't know
[52:18] about y'all but I've become
[52:19] miserable there were times in my life
[52:21] where I was just totally miserable with
[52:23] things but you know what God began to
[52:25] deal with me and you know what he began
[52:27] to show me the path that that I needed
[52:29] to take I bring me to a place and you
[52:31] know I had to come to a place and
[52:32] realize you know what I as brother Louis
[52:35] was saying this morning you know you
[52:36] come to a place Lord I don't want to
[52:37] live like this anymore I don't want to
[52:40] live like this anymore I I want to I
[52:42] want to surrender because he began to
[52:44] show you a better way he began to show
[52:47] you a better way and I Lord I want to
[52:48] walk that way amen and you know you
[52:50] began to realize who you are I realize
[52:52] I'm a sinner I realize I'm not where I
[52:54] ought to be but praise God he's made a
[52:57] way that you can come in amen that you
[52:59] can leave you leave your past sins
[53:02] that's right amen you know and you you
[53:04] see that you know he can clean you up
[53:06] and and take care of all these things
[53:08] and yet you know you see that you you
[53:09] begin to walk on this pathway that God
[53:12] is leading you and you as you begin to
[53:14] walk then you realize you know I'm going
[53:16] walk the way God wants me to walk and
[53:18] begin to go forward and you think well
[53:20] I've got all of these things in my life
[53:21] that I I you know I don't know how all
[53:23] these things are going to take place and
[53:25] I I I all you see is all the sin and all
[53:28] the problems that you have and all all
[53:29] these things it's like Lord I don't know
[53:31] how I'm going to get through all
[53:32] this but you know all all you can do is
[53:35] repent and start walking yes and that's
[53:39] and that's all you do Lord I don't know
[53:41] because why because when you get to a
[53:42] place of sanctification you know what it
[53:44] takes the Holy Spirit to clean you up
[53:46] and you realize you can't do it yourself
[53:49] but you know one thing I was listening
[53:50] to brother BR he was talking in the
[53:51] message he said what does it take to
[53:53] make a Christian Life and he begins to
[53:56] talk about he said see he said God sent
[53:58] his big b bulldozer down and cut the
[54:01] thing all to pieces he bulldozed it up
[54:03] and scraped it
[54:05] off and I thought that was so good
[54:07] because we sometimes we look at our
[54:09] lives and think Lord there's so much in
[54:10] our lives how are we going to get rid of
[54:12] all of this how are we going how are we
[54:14] going to take because we all we see is
[54:17] all of the problems that we have and all
[54:19] the all of the things that we've got to
[54:20] overcome and you're like well it's so
[54:22] impossible and sometimes we get
[54:24] overwhelmed with the things that we've
[54:25] had to face and not realizing how am I
[54:27] going to give up because you know
[54:29] sometimes you're so Bound by things
[54:31] because you say well I I was so Bound by
[54:33] smoking or or music or different things
[54:35] like that and sometimes it's a real
[54:37] challenge because you know what you fall
[54:39] and you keep you keep going through the
[54:40] same thing the same rut you just keep
[54:42] going on and on and on but you know what
[54:44] praise God one of these days God sent
[54:46] his bulldozzer in there and he began to
[54:49] scrape out
[54:51] everything I know I know well praise God
[54:54] you know because you know we we see how
[54:56] big the things in our lives are the
[54:58] biger challenge that we have the big
[55:00] structures that are in our lives and we
[55:02] think how are we going to overcome that
[55:04] well you know what the grace of God the
[55:05] power of the holy spirit will come in
[55:07] your life and it'll wipe it all out
[55:09] because greater is he that's in in you
[55:13] because he's greater than any problem
[55:15] that you have whatever is in your life
[55:17] he's greater than that and he will
[55:19] destroy all the strongholds that are in
[55:21] your life you think you can't overcome
[55:23] but you know what he's going to over
[55:25] he'll show you that you overcome he'll
[55:27] overcome through you if you just yield
[55:30] yourself to that thank you Jesus see
[55:33] there's a great big bulos that's gonna
[55:34] come in and just think I don't know how
[55:36] I'm gonna get through this I don't know
[55:37] how I overcome these things but you know
[55:39] what praise God the holy spirit will
[55:41] come and you'll see one of these days
[55:43] you'll rise up and you think well I have
[55:45] fallen a hundred times well guess what
[55:48] you get up 101 times and you keep going
[55:50] and one of these days you're going to
[55:52] find out that the Holy
[55:54] Spirit you're going to overcome that
[55:58] amen so you know you like well I I don't
[56:00] know I'm I'm so Bound by these things
[56:02] I'm so Bound by these things I was
[56:05] listening to brother Josh Bennett when
[56:06] he was up there at the camp you know he
[56:08] talking about you know that's what the
[56:09] devil wants you to do is you know is be
[56:11] down on the young people so much that
[56:13] you know that well I fail this time and
[56:15] I fail this time you know just keep
[56:16] going amen don't give
[56:20] up you know because for every you
[56:22] because I can count probably a half
[56:24] dozen young people that I've SE where
[56:26] you know they just allowed the devil to
[56:28] beat them up and they just fall apart
[56:30] and they never go beyond what they were
[56:32] at why because they gave up too easy
[56:35] because you know what the devil sold
[56:37] them a bill of goods that actually had
[56:39] no belief in it had nothing in it it was
[56:41] just a pack of lies and they believed it
[56:43] and they've allowed the devil to run
[56:45] rough shot over
[56:47] them but you know what there's there's
[56:49] been kids that have been bound by
[56:51] pornography and everything else that you
[56:53] can imagine smoking and drinking and all
[56:55] kinds of other perversions that's in the
[56:57] world but you know what they kept going
[56:59] and had faith in Jesus Christ to clean
[57:02] their lives up to free them from that
[57:04] and you know what when somebody come and
[57:06] told them listen you don't have to live
[57:08] like that you can take this you can take
[57:10] this and he will free you from that why
[57:13] because the the right has been given
[57:16] unto you if you will believe
[57:18] it and all of a sudden there's these
[57:20] young people come up there and they say
[57:21] you know I was bound by this and that
[57:24] and and all these other things when you
[57:27] know you talk about some of these young
[57:29] people when they when they're coming in
[57:30] prayer lines and they're standing there
[57:32] saying if the Lord doesn't do something
[57:34] for me I'm going to commit
[57:39] suicide when you see the the challenge
[57:42] that is placed before them you know what
[57:43] all you got to do is believe the devil's
[57:45] a liar that's it the devil wants you to
[57:49] believe that you can't
[57:50] overcome but let me tell you something
[57:52] there's a church full of people sitting
[57:54] here this morning that you know we
[57:56] overcome so many things in our lives if
[57:58] you go back and look what God has done
[57:59] for us what he brought us out of to
[58:02] where he's brought us this morning
[58:03] there's nothing that our God can't
[58:06] do
[58:08] right all you got to do is believe
[58:11] him that same spirit that same spirit
[58:16] that if he's done it for one he'll do it
[58:17] for another sir that's right he's here
[58:21] this morning to meet your need all you
[58:23] got to do is believe him he doesn't but
[58:25] the devil doesn't want you to believe
[58:31] that see there's so many people
[58:34] that they just devil wants you to look
[58:37] at everything
[58:41] else but take what God
[58:44] Said look what God Said Yes
[58:49] sir brother BR is talking about see the
[58:52] work of the Holy
[58:53] Spirit he said the Holy Spirit turned
[58:56] over the 10 Can Alley dumps you upside
[59:00] down sweeps the devil's stuff out of
[59:02] there and creates a new heart and a new
[59:04] life he said but not only that he moves
[59:07] in to see that everything goes all right
[59:10] he said glory to God he has the
[59:11] caretakers the angels that prunes the
[59:15] trees see you see the things that have
[59:17] went on in your life well guess what God
[59:19] is
[59:21] here and you know we we've all can
[59:23] testify to that that God has come in
[59:25] your lives and whatever you whatever you
[59:27] you think is so so hard that you can't
[59:30] overcome then you know what God has done
[59:32] greater there's people here this morning
[59:35] that has seen God come on the scene and
[59:37] do the
[59:38] miraculous and you know he's the same
[59:40] one why because if he started you on
[59:42] this journey there's no power in hell
[59:44] that's going to stop him he comes in and
[59:47] he said he going clean that up shake all
[59:49] of the devil stuff out sweep it all out
[59:51] bulldo it out and then he's going to
[59:54] come on the scene because if he's the
[59:56] one that started you on your journey to
[59:58] bring you to a place of sanctification
[59:59] and burn all of that stuff out and drive
[1:00:01] the unclean Spirit out then you know
[1:00:03] he's there to bring you to the place
[1:00:05] that you can be filled with the Holy
[1:00:07] Spirit he's there because if he's the
[1:00:09] one that justified you Sanctified you
[1:00:11] then he's one that's obligated if you
[1:00:13] continue on the same Journey the same
[1:00:16] Faith he's obligated to fill you with
[1:00:18] the Holy Ghost amen that's his job
[1:00:21] because he said the caretakers are there
[1:00:23] the angels of God are there to bring
[1:00:24] forth the word
[1:00:29] right see it's the same
[1:00:33] life if we he done the same thing in the
[1:00:36] past then it's the same thing he'll do
[1:00:37] today yes right see God has given us
[1:00:40] these things
[1:00:42] Amen to show you he's here to speak to

[1:00:58] us and it's not and it's not just one
[1:01:02] but you know each one of us has has a
[1:01:04] job to
[1:01:06] do just as you know as as brother uh
[1:01:10] brother Dale always said about you know
[1:01:12] when we dedicate children to the Lord he
[1:01:14] said you know each one of us is to live
[1:01:16] a life before those children that they
[1:01:18] can see Jesus Christ that if they were
[1:01:21] looking for a Godly example then we're
[1:01:23] supposed to live that life in front of
[1:01:24] them see each one one of us is supposed
[1:01:26] to do that each one of us if if
[1:01:28] somebody's looking because they say well
[1:01:30] you know the devil's trying to tell them
[1:01:32] well you you can't overcome and this and
[1:01:34] that and you know what you see people

[1:04:03] what God has done for me what God has
[1:04:05] done in my life it's the grace of God
[1:04:08] not what I done because I didn't do
[1:04:09] anything good there was nothing good in
[1:04:11] me but it's what God done through me God
[1:04:14] done this work through me but he started

[1:04:31] amen see all you got to do is trust
[1:04:34] trust God and and you know you see the
[1:04:37] the condition that the world has gotten
[1:04:38] into but you see but there's God has has
[1:04:42] a provided way he's he's got a provided
[1:04:44] plan and all you got to do is put your
[1:04:46] trust in that and just trust what God
[1:04:49] has done but see the problem is is you
[1:04:53] know we people have gotten so mixed up
[1:04:55] and so many things that you know that if
[1:04:57] you don't just trust God and just put
[1:05:00] your faith in the simple
[1:05:03] gospel and it's see you see how people
[1:05:05] have gotten so confused and so mixed up
[1:05:07] on things it's like well how are you how
[1:05:09] are you ever going to become free if you
[1:05:12] can't just trust
[1:05:13] God Amen and Trust just put your trust
[1:05:16] in the simple gospel
[1:05:19] right you know
[1:05:22] um I was listening you know I was on I
[1:05:26] was on the on the twoof face book and
[1:05:31] uh uh well you know that's that's what
[1:05:34] it is
[1:05:36] but you know it's it's it's it's pitiful
[1:05:39] but you you see the condition that the
[1:05:40] world is in today but you know you know
[1:05:43] there's so many people that have gotten
[1:05:45] to this place now in the world you know
[1:05:47] they don't they don't even try I mean
[1:05:49] they they say they believe this message
[1:05:51] they they say that they have their trust
[1:05:52] in it but the problem is is they don't
[1:05:55] yeah
[1:05:57] true and when you when you see because
[1:05:58] you know the thing
[1:05:59] is you know God works in continuity so
[1:06:02] you know when in the
[1:06:03] beginning God called men and he and he's
[1:06:06] led men all the way through and he's and
[1:06:08] he's had prophets and then later on you
[1:06:11] know he had Church age Messengers from
[1:06:13] you know Paul and you know Paul when
[1:06:15] when he was there in the in the first
[1:06:16] church age you know and he was begin to
[1:06:18] speak you know he wasn't the only one
[1:06:20] that God ever spoke to that he actually
[1:06:23] because he actually had a five-fold
[1:06:24] Ministry that was actually men even when
[1:06:27] Jesus began to preach the gospel it was
[1:06:29] it was the word made flesh and you know
[1:06:31] what he sent he sent disciples out to
[1:06:36] preach and then and then and Paul Paul
[1:06:39] wasn't the only one Paul didn't go out
[1:06:40] there and tell Peter like listen I'm the
[1:06:42] I'm the I'm the prophet of the age I'm
[1:06:44] the I'm the messenger you just need to
[1:06:46] be quiet and I'm G to
[1:06:48] speak but here's here's Paul
[1:06:52] speaking and he said and he gave some
[1:06:55] Apostles prophets evangelist teachers
[1:06:58] and
[1:06:59] pastors for the perfecting of the
[1:07:02] Saints till we all come to Unity of the
[1:07:06] faith so here's the here's this group so
[1:07:09] as it all the way down through time even
[1:07:11] in in in the patmas vision you hear
[1:07:13] brother brandham talk about he said he
[1:07:15] said the the voice of many Waters he
[1:07:17] said what was the voice of many Waters
[1:07:19] he said it was the voice of the
[1:07:21] ministers in every
[1:07:24] age the voice was singular yes go back
[1:07:29] look he said the voice of the ministers
[1:07:31] plural in every age
[1:07:35] singular so then there were multiple
[1:07:38] ministers in every age that were
[1:07:40] speaking according to the voice of their
[1:07:42] age
[1:07:43] amen was speaking according to thus
[1:07:46] sayith the Lord
[1:07:48] right and it was the same life it was
[1:07:50] the same
[1:07:52] Ministry and then all of a sudden we
[1:07:54] come to this into the end time and
[1:07:56] everybody's got to the point well you
[1:07:57] know what if if God works according to
[1:08:00] continuity then how is it that brother
[1:08:02] Bram was speaking and talking of a
[1:08:04] five-fold Ministry when they're in in
[1:08:07] questions and answers on the seals
[1:08:09] brother brandham they asked brother
[1:08:10] brandham they said will the bride have a
[1:08:12] Ministry before the
[1:08:15] Rapture he said yes it's going on right
[1:08:18] now amen and he says it consists of
[1:08:21] Apostles prophets P pastors evangelist
[1:08:24] teachers
[1:08:25] right but you know what he said it'll be
[1:08:27] so
[1:08:29] humble amen you know what hey you you
[1:08:32] you show me where brother Brown I'm done
[1:08:34] away with the fivefold
[1:08:36] ministry and you know what you show you
[1:08:38] show me somebody a true fivefold
[1:08:41] Ministry M uh one of the ministers in
[1:08:44] the five-fold ministry and show me where
[1:08:45] they try to take you away from the
[1:08:47] message that's
[1:08:51] right if if you're God called into the
[1:08:54] five-fold ministry even even if you're
[1:08:56] just a lan member but you know what
[1:08:58] everybody's going to point you right
[1:08:59] back to what the prophet had to say
[1:09:02] that's right that's right because
[1:09:04] rapturing faith lies in those books and
[1:09:06] tapes the rapturing faith lays right
[1:09:09] there that's where God wants you to be
[1:09:11] right in those right in those books and
[1:09:13] tapes but you know what because but the
[1:09:16] same God that pointed you right there
[1:09:19] into those messages where the Prophet is
[1:09:21] speaking is the same scripture that he
[1:09:24] said this is the absolute and tell me
[1:09:26] where he took out Ephesians
[1:09:29] 4 but when people come up there and you
[1:09:32] know they they want they want to act
[1:09:34] like they're so uh put against and and
[1:09:37] cut
[1:09:38] off well how how in the world are people
[1:09:41] that that are supposed to believe this
[1:09:43] message and then all of a sudden it's
[1:09:44] like well you know what we're going to
[1:09:45] take that out we're taking that
[1:09:48] out well let me tell you what the same
[1:09:51] life that was in the beginning it's if
[1:09:53] it's in you and I and we're able to draw
[1:09:55] from the same life that you know what
[1:09:58] it's the same life that spoke through
[1:10:00] Jesus that created all things that set
[1:10:03] everything in divine order and he
[1:10:05] brought and sent a prophet in our day
[1:10:07] all the way down through seven Church
[1:10:09] ages began to speak and fulfilled
[1:10:11] exactly what the scriptures said and he
[1:10:14] came and brother BR began to speak
[1:10:15] exactly what thus sayith the Lord was
[1:10:18] matched according to what the scripture
[1:10:19] had to say then you know what if it's
[1:10:21] the same one that could speak then you
[1:10:22] know what it's the same one that can
[1:10:24] speak to you and I and give us the exact
[1:10:26] same thing to
[1:10:31] say because you know I have I have I
[1:10:34] have full confidence that God sent a
[1:10:36] five-fold Ministry and God speaks to
[1:10:38] them and gives them exactly what has to
[1:10:40] be said and you know what I can put my
[1:10:42] confidence in that because you know I
[1:10:43] can put my confidence in everything that
[1:10:44] brother brandom said and I can sit and I
[1:10:46] can rejoice and listen to those books
[1:10:48] and tapes but you know what I can sit
[1:10:50] and listen to a five-fold Ministry
[1:10:51] preach and I can Rejoice on that too
[1:10:54] amen and I can I can Feast I can Feast
[1:10:56] on a five-fold Ministry and I don't I
[1:10:58] don't have one bit of problem with it I
[1:11:00] thank God for it because you know what
[1:11:02] if it hadn't been for them I wouldn't be
[1:11:04] where I'm at
[1:11:06] today but it t it takes the word but you
[1:11:08] know you see these people that come
[1:11:10] against them and you know when you when
[1:11:12] you begin to question these people about
[1:11:14] well you know we're just going to push
[1:11:15] play and we're not going to have
[1:11:17] anything else well you know what then
[1:11:18] then how is it that you can have
[1:11:20] confidence in God and put your trust in
[1:11:22] everything that he had to say it's like

[1:11:27] that so you're telling me that the same
[1:11:29] God that said all these other things put
[1:11:31] everything else in motion he can't speak
[1:11:33] to another
[1:11:34] human he because you know what we're
[1:11:36] just we're just up here saying what we
[1:11:38] we're just saying our own
[1:11:41] thing well this this is just this is
[1:11:43] just Aaron
[1:11:46] Roberts but you know I can see that God
[1:11:49] can speak through a
[1:11:51] man just like just like he did all
[1:11:54] through out through history hisory it's
[1:11:56] the same thing and you see these people
[1:11:59] and they and they they come against them
[1:12:00] and it's like listen show me where we're
[1:12:02] just supposed to push
[1:12:04] play just show me where we're we're not

[1:12:08] to have a fivefold
[1:12:09] Ministry or we're we're just do we don't
[1:12:12] about all these things just show me
[1:12:14] where it's
[1:12:15] written I and I I was I was talking to a
[1:12:20] brother the other day
[1:12:22] and and you know that's what happened to
[1:12:24] him he was
[1:12:25] brother show me where these things
[1:12:27] are and I and I and I I sent the brother
[1:12:31] a message and I told him I said brother
[1:12:32] I really appreciate what you had to
[1:12:34] say he's a minister and the way he
[1:12:36] handled things and I thought you done a
[1:12:38] really good job trying to show somebody
[1:12:40] Christian love and trying to show them
[1:12:43] you can disagree with
[1:12:45] somebody brother R said what we can dis
[1:12:47] bitterly disagree with one another still
[1:12:50] love one
[1:12:51] another amen but you know the problem
[1:12:54] was is this this brother took took what
[1:12:56] was said and when when when this
[1:12:59] Minister asked him some questions you
[1:13:01] know he got all upset then when when the
[1:13:04] the conversation was done he deleted it
[1:13:07] all and then he wrote well this brother
[1:13:09] you know done this and was trying to
[1:13:11] take us away from the Mana and all this
[1:13:13] kind of stuff and he said well I had to
[1:13:15] block him you know I had to delete all
[1:13:16] this
[1:13:17] stuff and I was like well where where in
[1:13:19] the world is any of that showing the
[1:13:22] love of God right
[1:13:26] and it's like then you you delete
[1:13:28] everything that was said and then you
[1:13:31] write you take it totally out of you
[1:13:32] totally misrepresent what was said you
[1:13:35] take it all out of context and then you
[1:13:36] write what you want and then you like
[1:13:38] well I'm defending the
[1:13:42] faith you know brother Bram said you
[1:13:44] know if you're going to if you're going
[1:13:45] to draw me outside your circle that's
[1:13:48] all right I'm just going to draw my
[1:13:49] circle bigger and draw you right back in
[1:13:51] exactly amen and it's like well you know
[1:13:54] where one of we're one of the Lord's
[1:13:56] despised
[1:13:57] few well you know what if you're pushing
[1:13:59] people out you're not one of the Lord's
[1:14:01] despised
[1:14:04] few because you know what we're going to
[1:14:06] reach out to everybody we're going to do
[1:14:09] all that we can to help everybody we're
[1:14:12] going to do what we can yeah and we're
[1:14:14] going to reach out and we're going to
[1:14:16] try to help but you know what they're
[1:14:17] the ones that walk away just like
[1:14:18] brother Lise was talking about this
[1:14:20] morning your friends you try to show
[1:14:21] them Jesus Christ but they're the ones
[1:14:23] that are going to walk away that's right
[1:14:25] right when Jesus began to speak to there
[1:14:28] in John 6 when he began to speak to them
[1:14:30] they walked away from
[1:14:33] him he didn't he didn't turn his back on
[1:14:35] them right they rejected
[1:14:39] him and it's the same way you and I
[1:14:41] we're trying to reach all that we can
[1:14:42] and try to help all that we can we we
[1:14:45] want them to un we want them to see
[1:14:47] Jesus Christ because that's what because
[1:14:50] that's what is the heart of God to reach
[1:14:53] the lost that's right to reach those
[1:14:56] that don't have those that are confused
[1:14:58] and that's what the brother was telling
[1:14:59] me about when I when I wrote him he's
[1:15:01] said well you know this brother's just
[1:15:02] confused he said all you can do is pray
[1:15:04] for
[1:15:05] them but you know it's it's not that
[1:15:07] we're trying to do what but you know we
[1:15:08] we want them to see the truth
[1:15:12] yes and and it's so sad that people
[1:15:15] they've got their own ideas and you
[1:15:18] can't you can't tell
[1:15:20] them oh it takes the Holy Spirit to to
[1:15:23] do that for them they can
[1:15:27] but God wants us to do what we can to if
[1:15:30] if if we have that life on the inside
[1:15:32] then you know
[1:15:33] what it's if we yield ourselves and
[1:15:35] that's what our job is to do is to
[1:15:37] manifest that life to the world that
[1:15:40] they can see Jesus Christ see energizing
[1:15:43] us to
[1:15:46] this see leading us that
[1:15:49] way see we see these things that God is
[1:15:52] trying to do he wants you to see these
[1:15:54] things see if if the life is on the
[1:15:57] inside if he's if he's making this
