[8:00] kind of fellowship hanging and bringing
[8:02] out some things and parts of the things

[8:57] you change not
[8:58] we thank you lord thank you for the day
[9:01] in the hour thank you for the time that
[9:02] we have thank you for the word that you
[9:05] have been revealed in our day that we
[9:08] could actually follow after and come on
[9:10] to know the god of the word
[9:12] and see in reality they understand the
[9:15] things that you've tried to express to
[9:18] us all the way down through we ask you
[9:20] to just have your way forgive our sins
[9:22] because we want to stand complete in you
[9:25] Lord and just that's your loving grace

[9:42] thing because we know and realize that
[9:46] without that we have no hopes and we
[9:50] rest in you we love you and we thank you
[9:52] bless each one now you said in your word
[9:54] you sent your word and healed us and
[9:56] delivered us from destruction so let
[9:58] that take place among us in Jesus name
[10:02] Amen John one this ought to be becoming
[10:08] a little more clearer of our
[10:11] understanding it says in the beginning
[10:15] was the word and the Word was with God
[10:17] and the Word was God
[10:19] the same was in the beginning with God
[10:21] and I brought around him I thought of
[10:22] that what he said he said hold up you
[10:25] get on something hold up one thing he
[10:27] said the people get it and then move on
[10:29] okay we'll hold this up for a while okay
[10:32] the same was in the beginning with God
[10:34] all things were made by him and without
[10:37] him was not anything made that was made
[10:39] in him was life and the life was a lot
[10:42] of men and the light shine us in
[10:44] darkness and the darkness comprehended
[10:46] it not okay now we won't get all of this
[10:51] off but we're going over to Hebrews five
[10:55] and we'll pick up a few verses in verse
[11:00] in chapter five and then go over to
[11:02] chapter seven
[11:04] alright so five and verse five so
[11:09] also Christ glorified not himself to be
[11:13] made at High Priest and watch the
[11:16] scriptures and listen but he that said
[11:19] unto Him thou art my son as Hebrews 10 5
[11:24] you begotten him today have I begotten
[11:28] thee as he said also in another place
[11:32] dar - priest forever after the order of
[11:35] Melchisedec
[11:37] who in the days of his flesh when he had
[11:40] offered up prayers and supplications
[11:42] with strong strong crying in tears unto
[11:46] him that was able to save him from death
[11:48] was heard in that he feared now that was
[11:53] this Christ the Son of God hanging on
[11:55] the cross all right though he were a son
[11:59] yet learned he obedience by the things
[12:02] that he suffered and being made perfect
[12:06] he became the author of eternal
[12:08] salvation unto all them that obey Him
[12:12] called of God and high priest after the
[12:17] order of melchizedek all right now you
[12:19] know that the argument that the Prophet
[12:22] brought out is in showing us who is this
[12:24] Melchizedek and the things that some
[12:27] says it's a priesthood some says it says
[12:29] some says it's that and trying to make
[12:31] it but putting it together now with this
[12:34] thought in Chapter 7 I remember he's
[12:38] high priest after the order of
[12:39] Melchisedec for this melt shattered it
[12:43] king of Salem priest of the Most High
[12:45] God who made Abraham returning from the
[12:48] slaughter of the Kings and blessed him
[12:50] to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part
[12:53] of all first being by interpretation
[12:56] king of righteousness and after that
[12:59] also king of Salem which is king of
[13:02] peace without father without mother
[13:05] without descent neither having beginning
[13:09] of days nor end of life but made like
[13:13] unto the Son of God about it the priest
[13:17] continually now watch this now consider
[13:20] how great this man
[13:22] and would just a priesthood it's a man
[13:29] that consider how great this man was
[13:32] unto whom even the patriarch Abraham
[13:35] gave the tenth of the Spoils you may be
[13:38] seated
[13:39] Lord that is blessing to the reading of
[13:42] the word now we were discussing this a
[13:44] little last night in the Bible study and
[13:49] see for quite a while now this is 20
[13:51] messages on this series part and my
[13:56] thought has been to try to get you and I
[14:00] to realize how real God is that's why I
[14:04] read that from you know chapter five and
[14:08] then go to chapter 7 because if you
[14:11] stick with chapter five you're staying
[14:13] with even though you would be talking
[14:15] about a son of God you would stay with
[14:18] an order of of a priesthood style but
[14:23] then when you get over in Chapter seven
[14:25] it brings that down from a priesthood
[14:29] style to a man and that's the Christ the
[14:34] Son of the Living God who is what
[14:36] Almighty God condescending down for you
[14:42] and I to be able to understand him now
[14:48] that's the purpose of of what is taking
[14:50] place now alright now the last Sunday we
[14:54] covered talking about that we were going
[14:58] to cover like three things one how God
[15:05] condescended down to you know reveal
[15:09] himself or come into being come into
[15:13] manifestation alright then we're going
[15:17] to talk today more on how that Adam came
[15:21] into being okay and then if we get
[15:26] through this in time we will try to
[15:28] cover today if not we'll cover it next
[15:31] Sunday on how that you and I come in
[15:34] to be alright see that way we can follow
[15:37] it to the scriptures and I was thinking
[15:42] there last night as we were talking you
[15:45] know what are the great opportunity that
[15:49] you and I have had for God to reveal
[15:54] himself to you and I what great thing
[16:00] would you think we could do to merit
[16:04] that what would be anything you and I
[16:07] could even consider has to be merits of
[16:11] the basis that he would do this that he
[16:15] would reveal himself the bringing
[16:21] himself into being what a wonderful
[16:24] opportunity to think about that God
[16:28] condescended to mankind and we know the
[16:31] reason that he came was for the fact
[16:35] that he would have to come and fulfill
[16:36] all of the word alright he would come to
[16:39] the basis that his purpose for coming
[16:42] the way he came all right was to be able
[16:46] to die in the place of mankind to be a
[16:53] savior to fulfill all of his attributes
[16:55] see we went through a lot of the things
[16:58] he created Adam that would have made him
[17:01] father
[17:01] angels worshiped him that would have
[17:04] made him God a lot of those things were
[17:07] attributes that he had but he had other
[17:10] attributes right he wanted to be a
[17:13] savior a healer etc and to do that it
[17:16] would mean that he would have to come
[17:19] into human flesh but remember it's the
[17:25] same God being revealed not a Trinity or
[17:30] a concept or a thought or ideas and
[17:33] that's why to me like brother Branham on
[17:35] who's this Mel Saturday that he was
[17:37] trying his best to lay down how real God
[17:39] was you know and he said people would
[17:43] say you mean to tell me that Melchizedek
[17:45] was God
[17:47] he said that was Almighty God stepped
[17:51] into a human vessel and appeared to
[17:55] Abraham and the things you know and
[17:58] doing those things because that was his
[18:02] purpose in doing all right now to do
[18:07] that then he would have to condescend
[18:10] award mankind and that's the point I've
[18:13] been making and we'll keep making it for
[18:15] you to understand that he kinda sins but
[18:23] he doesn't change
[18:24] melih Khatri said I'm God and I changed
[18:28] not then he changed his forms to reveal
[18:34] himself but he doesn't change himself
[18:39] he's not one person over here and
[18:41] another person over here another person
[18:43] over here there's not three persons me
[18:47] all right
[18:48] it's the same God being revealed or
[18:52] being made manifest you said well why
[18:54] didn't he do it this away all right why
[18:58] don't you tell him how to do it that's
[19:01] what the scripture said who was back
[19:02] there to tell me how to do these things
[19:03] you know there's no way that anybody can
[19:06] tell him how to change things because
[19:09] the way he came was the way the perfect
[19:12] way of coming all right but what about
[19:15] you and I see still trying to follow
[19:19] something on the lines of our original
[19:21] thoughts of you know that well God is
[19:25] just the spirit brother Dale has spent
[19:28] months and months talking about how real
[19:30] God is and he's just a spirit no he's
[19:34] not just the spirit God is a spirit when
[19:39] you put the just on now you're making
[19:41] him something that your limited him to
[19:43] some form are doing well but we've went
[19:47] back to into eternity to come out from
[19:50] there to see how real he was back there
[19:54] and how he had a form
[19:59] and all of the things and it's coming
[20:02] down to revealing to itself now to where
[20:05] we can follow and and follow in the word
[20:08] to be able to realize where you and I
[20:13] stand and what God has done for you and
[20:15] I to reveal himself now we talked about
[20:22] we've been talking for quite a while
[20:23] about how that he would like to say the
[20:26] word in morphe which would be change in
[20:29] form alright but not change in persons
[20:35] now there was a time that I was just a
[20:39] child a son but then time developed own
[20:44] and I became a husband time developed
[20:49] own and I became a father time developed
[20:53] owner became a grandfather time
[20:56] developed to only become a
[20:58] great-grandfather now if your hope it
[21:02] doesn't go on to the great great and
[21:03] great great great great get all them
[21:05] others you know I don't want dad but the
[21:08] thing of my I'm getting out what it it's
[21:10] the same person well I thought so simple
[21:15] why didn't the theologians think of that
[21:19] when they were looking at the wordings
[21:21] annoying and they were even using the
[21:24] words in morphe to change in form and
[21:28] things like that they had those things
[21:31] in there they're doing but yet it was
[21:35] suing to mass confusion till they
[21:37] couldn't follow and like I've always
[21:40] tried to tell you see the scholars knew
[21:42] that that one that came out from God in
[21:45] the beginning would be called a son of
[21:48] God but see we want to make it another
[21:52] person or another concept or thought
[21:56] instead of it being the same person
[21:58] being revealed and that's why I've tried
[22:02] my best to get you to to hang on to the
[22:05] points that when you say all God was he
[22:08] poured into Christ well don't do away
[22:10] with God
[22:11] that's just a statement then all Christ
[22:16] poured into the church that doesn't do
[22:19] away with Christ that's just a statement
[22:20] it's just showing you worries Act and
[22:24] what he's doing like I'm saying to me
[22:27] right now
[22:27] see I can say I'm a child I'm a son well
[22:32] my wife could raise her hand womb he's
[22:36] my husband
[22:37] the kids they can say he's my daddy the
[22:42] grandkids can say he's my grandpa and
[22:47] then finally you know come back to verse
[22:52] Deanna she's here or someone she would
[22:55] be saying that he's my great-grandpa but
[22:59] have it changed maybe got fatter uglier
[23:02] oh yeah
[23:03] but have it changed in the point of what
[23:06] I am while simple that is to think of a
[23:12] Godhead like that no wonder the Bible
[23:17] says even the eternal Godhead can be
[23:18] understood by the things that we see but
[23:21] that's been my purpose in my thought to
[23:24] try to get us to not get tied up in
[23:27] anything but just follow along simply
[23:30] and come down alright we spent quite a
[23:34] while talking about the great eternal
[23:37] God and then that he had these
[23:40] attributes he had all the time and he
[23:43] began to come to sin and he condescended
[23:46] into what the scholars would call him
[23:48] the logos little oh gosh would mean
[23:52] speech so he condescended to her that he
[23:57] could speak it wasn't that he couldn't
[24:01] speak it was the way he chose to come
[24:04] forward I want you to follow that it was
[24:07] the way he chose to do it one goes you
[24:10] know he chose the perfect way see then
[24:15] when he who comes into the form of to be
[24:17] able to speak see now he doesn't just
[24:23] you know say back he comes forth unveils
[24:28] himself and they use the word theophany
[24:34] and in doing that then you're coming to
[24:37] as we were covering life Sunday then
[24:41] you're coming to what he was calling
[24:43] from who is this Melchizedek a word body
[24:46] a word form body remember that see Jesus
[24:53] Christ came that away not Jesus - flesh
[24:57] no that's one in the Hebrews there it
[25:02] talks about it he see this one your son
[25:08] has a beginning but in Jesus Christ it
[25:14] wasn't no son having a beginning as
[25:16] something starting it was the flash man
[25:20] the flash is what you're talking about
[25:24] at a beginning not the Christ not too
[25:28] low cost not to speech not the thing not
[25:31] the eternal God didn't have a beginning
[25:33] it was the flash man that had a
[25:36] beginning right see then in that as he
[25:40] then became the one that the Bible would
[25:42] say that he created all things by Jesus
[25:46] Christ right
[25:50] he became the word or took a form or
[25:53] whatever you want to call it stepped
[25:55] over into condescended into another form
[25:57] to speak or be the word and he's called
[26:02] it the off the body art he came that
[26:04] away all right we'll catch where the
[26:08] Prophet said you and I by Pais that will
[26:13] see he came that away he came into that
[26:17] form and I way I love it is the way the
[26:20] Prophet brought it out he said you say
[26:23] was he in a theophany before he said
[26:26] that's whom else yes it was
[26:29] read who is this melchester dick over
[26:32] and over he said that's where he come in
[26:35] to Melchizedek to prove that he was the
[26:41] word he'd already created he had already
[26:44] brought everything into being to prove
[26:47] that he was the word but yet he stepped
[26:49] into Melchizedek or didn't you know you
[26:54] know what I'm talking about how the
[26:55] prophet described it he said he just
[26:57] said nobody come forth
[27:00] God was in that body that we call
[27:08] Melchizedek who was in that body the
[27:11] same God that created the world then
[27:15] what happened that same God Lorenz said
[27:19] we see no more of Melchizedek
[27:20] in that an odd statement of things and
[27:23] it just looked like something gone you
[27:26] know like it you don't need that no more
[27:28] it's gone no that's not what he's
[27:30] talking about
[27:31] he said we see no more of milk Saturday
[27:33] he said because Jesus Christ milk said
[27:37] it becomes Jesus Christ all right
[27:40] see then they're on the shores of
[27:42] galleries are the baby in the cradle
[27:43] whatever you want to talk about was that
[27:46] very almighty god that created the world
[27:52] was laying in that cradle as a baby is
[27:58] it hard for us to follow
[28:02] he shouldn't be and hard to comprehend
[28:11] the simplicity of the way the Prophet
[28:14] brought it makes it so simple
[28:18] until we can understand see but he
[28:23] became then the he was the word a
[28:26] theophany body a word body that was
[28:31] where he stepped over into a form called
[28:33] the word a word body the Prophet would
[28:36] call him signifying that something was
[28:39] real not just a spirit
[28:42] creating they become more into what we
[28:48] could look at his tangible forms or
[28:50] words or whatever to express and see
[28:55] that's why I said about then he didn't
[28:58] just stay back that's creator the same
[29:00] God came in to flesh and appeared to
[29:05] Abraham the same one that created the
[29:10] world then the same one was a baby in
[29:14] the cradle because there he would
[29:15] almighty god body created by the word
[29:21] soul and spirit being Almighty God
[29:25] himself
[29:26] dwelling in human flesh to your prophet
[29:28] would say your little Jehovah crying in
[29:32] the cradle your little God with no teeth
[29:37] that's wonderful though the man could
[29:40] make the term who was a theologian had
[29:42] never thought of those type of ways to
[29:45] express and see you'll know that it
[29:47] couldn't come to a theologian because we
[29:49] couldn't understand the terms and in the
[29:51] ways that he was talking about but just
[29:55] remember you remember how we kept them
[29:58] from bringing it all out what he was a
[30:03] man he was a man he wasn't just a myth
[30:08] or a thought or a concept or a spirit he
[30:13] was a man the man Christ Jesus the Bible
[30:16] calls it something tangible where you
[30:22] can follow after it see not another
[30:24] person like I said I changed from son to
[30:33] father
[30:34] you know the husband to father the
[30:36] grandfather the great grandfather but I
[30:40] never changed it was just the way that
[30:44] I'm gonna do and listen and still all of
[30:50] those
[30:52] that's the point I want you to see about
[30:54] God I'm still all of those forms right
[30:59] because I've become married didn't do
[31:02] away with me being a son because we
[31:07] become a father doesn't Matt do away
[31:09] with in it like it's I still got those
[31:12] forms well see Father Son and Holy Ghost
[31:17] he didn't move over in another form and
[31:20] do away with the app but I've listened
[31:24] and you have yourself if you just think
[31:25] you've heard sermons on all God was he
[31:29] poured into Christ all means all now all
[31:33] was it all maybe you don't listen in
[31:38] like you don't listen now too but taint
[31:45] all God was he poured into cry did that
[31:48] do away with God he still got that phone
[31:53] to prove it he's got that form Jesus the
[31:56] Christ spoke to the Father from the
[31:58] earth but you see what my point trying
[32:06] to get us to see one true and living God
[32:12] and see how he came into being the word
[32:16] that he could create and do all the
[32:18] things and bring us into being and see
[32:23] then that God he wouldn't be another
[32:25] person brother branham will get it he
[32:30] said you see that he's hung up too low
[32:32] gosta theophany the word look he said
[32:34] like a child playing before the father's
[32:39] door he never done away with the father
[32:44] like I said I heard him that all and and
[32:47] see when they're all oh god why he
[32:50] poured in the cross well now when you
[32:53] say that with that meaning without
[32:55] explaining it
[32:56] what do you ask what are you emphasizing
[32:58] between no God
[33:03] go - oh god why would you pour it in the
[33:06] crash well that don't leave you God at
[33:10] least Christ I don't sound too bad but
[33:15] what about all Christ poured into the
[33:16] church you realize you only got the
[33:19] church Church I'm sorry I'm sorry for
[33:24] this tape and have always made at that
[33:25] point and I wish I could never had the
[33:28] statement to mate but do you realize
[33:31] what you're doing
[33:33] you are right in the devil's trap the
[33:38] people of this message are following the
[33:40] devil of a trap of what is there saying
[33:43] all God was you just do away with God
[33:46] all Christ you just do well cry you
[33:48] leave the church is not that exactly
[33:51] what Satan says I will ascend above is
[33:59] not that the truth now but you don't
[34:02] like that so you say well he's being
[34:04] hateful talking about brother showing so
[34:06] I heard him he didn't say it like that
[34:10] go back and hurt it again you might hurt
[34:15] more the next time but that's just the
[34:21] point see that I've always tried to make
[34:22] see that way you're keeping the one God
[34:25] in line that way you don't have any
[34:30] problems with us praying to a father
[34:34] this in heaven yeah but he's right in
[34:38] here I don't have to pray see that's
[34:40] that's the way we the way we go then we
[34:47] do away with all the scripture talks
[34:48] about prayer pray without ceasing well
[34:51] if you don't it's like what sister who
[34:53] used to play the piano for us years ago
[34:55] she said the way that y'all are teaching
[34:59] the Godhead said who do I pray to he
[35:03] said because I'm that God I said you
[35:07] went too far that ain't what we're
[35:10] teaching
[35:12] you've done away with some things that
[35:15] ain't the way that I'm trying to bring
[35:17] it you see that was her she don't I who
[35:20] drop right if you do away with God put
[35:25] it all in Christ and do what Christ put
[35:26] it in charging in here you just pray to
[35:28] yourself cuz you're the god is he not
[35:33] realizing how Satan's got its you in his
[35:34] traps okay but listen see he never
[35:40] changes my whole point when God moved he
[35:44] didn't move over into enough he just
[35:46] took another form to reveal himself as
[35:50] the word all right as a word body the
[35:55] fullness of God dwelt in that right but
[36:02] see there's no way none of us can be the
[36:04] fullness so then what we got to go from
[36:06] your own is we can't make any of us the
[36:09] fullness we make us together as one in
[36:12] Christ as the fullness yes because the
[36:17] Godhead brother Ennis is not complete
[36:18] without you see we've got to keep that
[36:21] line and that thought keeping it to
[36:25] where we can look at it he's called a
[36:31] word body so remember how he is a word
[36:34] body are you listening
[36:41] see I know a lot of you ain't call don't
[36:43] know what you're doing but listen he was
[36:49] word body theophany word body he came
[36:55] that away but see you and I've got to
[36:59] bypass that to come into flesh to be
[37:02] tempted all right now but think about
[37:07] how he came and think about what we're
[37:13] seeing that is a theophany is a word
[37:18] body that's the hardest thing seemingly
[37:20] for us to keep away from our own
[37:25] of it when you say Piaf knee up in
[37:30] heaven something up dire worse above
[37:32] it's about it's a word body in Jesus
[37:41] Christ Himself was that Almighty God the
[37:48] same one that created the world was
[37:51] standing on earth in the human flesh
[37:54] right and inside of him was that very
[38:00] word that's according to the scripture
[38:04] in the beginning was the word word was
[38:05] gotten word was God then why would verse
[38:07] 14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[38:09] among us she's been thinking about how
[38:14] that he came forth see he didn't have to
[38:19] come from this to this to there that was
[38:22] the way he chose for the revealing
[38:24] himself he didn't listen I'm quoting
[38:31] brother Adam warrior and it's he who
[38:34] claimed right around to be a prophet so
[38:36] we ought to be able to quote him see he
[38:38] said Jesus couldn't be tempted you ever
[38:43] noticed him saying I don't want we need
[38:46] to turn right back around and said Jesus
[38:48] was tempted in the wilderness and he
[38:50] talked about what's he saying is he so
[38:56] much contrary he doesn't understand his
[38:58] own language that he's music it was the
[39:05] point that he never come to the earth to
[39:07] be tempted right he came to earth to
[39:14] live as a mortal being which would mean
[39:17] that he would come in to a point of
[39:19] being tempted because the Bible says no
[39:24] end
[39:25] Tim's God you said what the devil took
[39:31] him up and showed he mr. Jody man that's
[39:33] right but he never yielded to another
[39:35] thing that the devil ever had either
[39:37] right think about it now listen we got
[39:45] into a point and I emphasize a little
[39:47] bit on the last message this is what
[39:53] happens brother Brennan said on who is
[39:55] God he said that he come out of the
[39:59] bosom of the Father well that looked
[40:05] like two people don't that's not two
[40:10] people that's God manifesting himself
[40:13] remember the illustration I'm a son I'm
[40:17] a father I'm a husband somebody else
[40:18] tell me there's no but I'm just one
[40:21] person and one reality trying to be you
[40:24] know standing here you looking at it see
[40:27] then watch what I'm trying to say
[40:31] you realize brother branham when placing
[40:33] it the way he did he would talk about
[40:37] that logos being the son of God now he'd
[40:42] never talked about the logos being the
[40:44] son of God the Son there's no such thing
[40:47] there is the son of God listed in the
[40:50] Bible but not God the Son see that's our
[40:54] ideas all right you said well it's all
[40:57] the same no it's not all the same but
[41:02] see the son was the creator that's why
[41:07] you keep it all tied together that when
[41:09] you come down he was finally standing on
[41:12] earth called the son of God but yet it
[41:16] was the Creator because he came word
[41:26] then flesh how do we come then the one
[41:35] that I love I want to want him to pull
[41:37] this one up cuz I'm skipping over a lot
[41:39] of but don't you pull up number six if
[41:43] you will in the notes
[41:46] the others are things we went over and
[41:49] over and over and over but listen let's
[41:56] move on in to at least Adam for today
[41:59] and look at him now think about what
[42:04] he's saying he's talking about the
[42:07] condescending of God and how that he's
[42:11] in a word body paragraph or two before
[42:14] then and then he says in this in his
[42:17] stage is the stage of his creation later
[42:19] form into flesh Jesus from what from the
[42:22] great beginning spirit then came down to
[42:25] be the word bringing itself out the word
[42:27] doesn't yet make itself it's just spoke
[42:30] out in morphe later he becomes flesh
[42:33] Jesus mortal to taste this for all of us
[42:37] now listen when Abraham met him he was
[42:41] Melchizedek
[42:42] now who's Melchizedek milchester he
[42:47] could Almighty God right that's the
[42:50] whole purpose that was all the whole
[42:52] message last week Melchizedek is
[42:54] Almighty God so now watch what he said
[42:59] in Morpher later Jesus mortal to taste
[43:02] death when Abraham met him huh o mighty
[43:08] God he was Melchizedek he couldn't die
[43:16] for you that's why Paul picks him up and
[43:21] saying that Melchizedek is a priesthood
[43:26] he's the high priest but he said Jesus
[43:31] is more than a high priests Melchizedek
[43:38] was God in a human vessel but that human
[43:41] vessel was just spoke into existence and
[43:43] spoke back out of existence all right
[43:47] but Jesus came in and he never laughs
[43:50] it's not doing it on him so he's a
[43:55] priesthood
[43:57] and that's one mankind and the Prophet
[44:00] read it see they've argued over and over
[44:02] that still one group says he's a
[44:04] priesthood another group says is this
[44:06] you know he said who is it
[44:08] he said he's Almighty God because he was
[44:14] a priest to it but that's how he could
[44:15] have been was a priesthood under the
[44:17] order that was revealed to Abraham but
[44:22] he was the word now listen he met
[44:28] Abraham he was Mel Chesney now look
[44:32] there's an outstanding wonderful
[44:34] statement right there if you just listen
[44:38] he unfolds here what are all the
[44:42] attributes are we the attributes of God
[44:48] so what is the Bride of Christ to do
[44:52] marina what all the attributes we'll do
[44:57] in the final end ever son of Abraham
[45:05] ever son of the faith will absolutely do
[45:09] the same thing what what is every son of
[45:15] Abraham to do the same thing Abraham did
[45:17] is that right I'm a Colin is that
[45:22] sensible ever son of Abraham and we're
[45:25] the seed of Abraham by faith we are the
[45:28] children of Abraham by faith and so
[45:32] connected to do it till you even think
[45:35] about it we were talking about it last
[45:36] night you think about it it's so
[45:39] connected until the old testament
[45:42] paradise was called the bosom of Abraham
[45:46] not the belly of Abraham the bosom of
[45:52] Abraham what the very faith of Abraham
[46:00] to believe God without even having a new
[46:04] birth God said Abraham you got it and
[46:09] said I'm gonna put it all on earth God
[46:10] I'm gonna call it the seed of Abraham
[46:13] right that's why you're the children of
[46:16] Abraham by faith but I'm not you know
[46:20] Jews not a Jesus a Jew either but look
[46:26] what happened Abraham met God melchester
[46:33] do all right
[46:36] the hoos melts edited Almighty God he's
[46:40] the word the Prophet brings in Hood is
[46:43] melt setting it down from self-existing
[46:46] down true to the word and said that word
[46:50] appeared as Melchizedek before he become
[46:57] flesh of Jesus Christ so what's gonna
[47:05] happen to ever seed of Abraham Abraham
[47:10] met Melchizedek which was God in a human
[47:13] vessel the word what's ever seed of
[47:20] Abraham going to do you see now and
[47:25] catch on to it you'll finally realize
[47:27] why I emphasize so much what is the new
[47:31] birth the new birth is the birth of the
[47:37] word right it's not an anointing is not
[47:41] a shouting is not a crying it's not a
[47:45] visions it's not in its the word
[47:48] revealed
[47:53] ever seed of Abraham is to meet the word
[48:02] while we're here
[48:05] now I'm giving it ahead of time brother
[48:08] Brennan says we meet the word here let's
[48:12] see we're not good Baptists or good
[48:14] thoughts of people they said well one of
[48:16] these days we're gonna be this we don't
[48:17] know we'll be that we would either know
[48:20] we're gonna meet the word right here
[48:23] like I was trying my best to get people
[48:26] to see a little bit life's not from it
[48:28] what we step ahead even of the world in
[48:35] our Redemption we're already in ahead of
[48:39] the world because our soul is redeemed
[48:43] and and our body is already claimed
[48:46] right we're even ahead of the world
[48:49] already the souls redeemed future I'm
[48:54] gonna read it he said waiving the
[48:56] redemption of the body yeah but it's
[48:59] already claim there's your plan of
[49:02] salvation the redemption darzee seals
[49:04] ours you think all right pull that back
[49:07] up now world everybody can tell he
[49:09] unfolds here what the attribute what all
[49:12] the attributes will do in the final end
[49:14] ever son of Abraham ever son of the
[49:18] faith will absolutely do the same thing
[49:21] what exactly like Abraham meeting
[49:25] Melchizedek but I want you to watch how
[49:32] we have to come all right but ever seed
[49:37] of the faith is to meet the word you see
[49:41] if you understand the new birth is a
[49:44] birth of the word then in that first
[49:47] church age they met the word the second
[49:50] church age they met the word 3rd 4th 5th
[49:54] 6th 7th 8th you meet the word that is
[50:00] your new birth and then you start a
[50:02] growth development from the new birth of
[50:06] faith of the unveiling of the word until
[50:09] we come out to a change in the body
[50:20] but we meet the word here it's not doing
[50:25] it some words out see that's one of this
[50:27] message folks this message is the Word
[50:31] of God if you'd ever get that in your
[50:34] mind you and how trouble trying to read
[50:35] books or listen to tapes you would
[50:38] realize that that message off of there
[50:40] that a human vessel is being used but
[50:43] God is speaking through that human
[50:45] vessel right straight to you but we read
[50:52] it is speaking to everybody else
[50:54] well if sister so-and-so would get
[50:55] straightened out with her dress codes
[50:57] and you know that's the way we read we
[51:01] don't read it what we are it's me in my
[51:06] house Lord
[51:07] okay what do you understand ever see to
[51:12] the faith is going to meet the word well
[51:17] I just don't know how do you meet you
[51:19] are you born again okay you born again
[51:23] then the born-again experience is what
[51:25] you heard the word you accepted the word
[51:30] and even in the Gospels that says they
[51:33] took the word and held on to it where
[51:36] the others floated away from it right
[51:40] and the Holy Ghost come onto their
[51:42] Pentecost to give birth to the word they
[51:44] had held there's a new birth so watch
[51:49] the statue of a perfect man Nolan it's
[51:52] the birth of the world your new birth
[51:55] started when you believe did you
[51:59] understand that woman that's why they
[52:03] can't understand brother Branham cuz
[52:04] he'll say one time you got the Holy
[52:06] Ghost when you believe then you don't
[52:09] say now you need to go get down here to
[52:10] the altar and get the Holy Ghost cause
[52:12] you already believe in that see because
[52:18] when you believe you started your
[52:21] journey but remember until the Holy
[52:24] Ghost comes on that to make that fully
[52:27] alive you notice the wording for
[52:30] alive in you you don't have the new
[52:34] birth then you come into the scriptures
[52:39] of what being born again you're being
[52:45] born again your new birth is not
[52:47] complete until the change of this body
[52:51] it's not complete adoption brings you to
[52:56] the authorities of sonship son done but
[52:59] he's got to take us on to a change to be
[53:03] the new birth when you when we go out of
[53:05] here in the air we can say our new birth
[53:07] is complete but until then we're being
[53:12] born again so he ought to know that I'm
[53:16] heading toward stature of a perfect man
[53:17] if I ever get to alright but now think
[53:21] about it let's think about cuz we'll at
[53:27] least try to cover Adam alright go ahead
[53:32] to number seven still offer who's this
[53:38] male charity paragraph sixty-seven now
[53:45] we see the attribute sons of his spirit
[53:50] have not entered into the word form body
[53:55] we haven't entered the word form body
[53:57] it's not complete yet come on can I
[54:02] quote brother brown he said your soul is
[54:04] not complete it only has the earnest you
[54:07] know what the earnest to your soul is
[54:09] eternal life you get eternal life your
[54:13] soul not fully complete yet
[54:15] why cause you statue of a perfect man
[54:17] right
[54:19] okay listen put a theophany this body is
[54:22] subject to the word in earnest waiting
[54:25] for the earnest change of the body and
[54:28] once you now the different between him
[54:32] and you as a son now the difference in
[54:38] him and you we're gonna read this part
[54:41] but then will brought over to Adam
[54:42] because we've got a
[54:43] fitted in but we're gonna be talking
[54:46] about you and me because there is a tiny
[54:50] bit differential or what it would call
[54:55] it difference there's a tiny difference
[54:57] between the way Jesus came and the way
[55:01] Adam came all right now there's a tiny
[55:05] bit of difference between the way you
[55:06] and I come that's the way Adam came so
[55:11] that's why I'm covering it in three
[55:13] stages all right there was a tiny bit
[55:17] well I was just born again like Adam
[55:19] that's what he said
[55:20] Adam wasn't born again Adam received
[55:24] eternal life as an impartation Oh see a
[55:30] lot of difference now the difference
[55:34] between him and you as a son he was at
[55:39] the beginning the word Animorph Abadi
[55:43] and wants him he came and lived in that
[55:51] before we come in flesh watching in the
[55:54] person of Mel chassidut then later we
[55:58] never heard no more of Melchisedec
[55:59] because he became Jesus Christ
[56:02] Melchizedek was the priest but he became
[56:06] Jesus Christ
[56:07] now you bypass that now what you bypass
[56:19] you buy pies coming to what he can mean
[56:25] he says you come like Adam like me you
[56:33] become from the attribute to the flesh
[56:37] to be tempted you're reading now but
[56:44] when this life is finished here if this
[56:46] earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have
[56:47] one already waiting that's where we go
[56:50] that is the word now how did Adam come
[57:02] how did Adam come into being now Jesus
[57:12] came now listen to what I'm saying to
[57:15] the way I say it
[57:16] Jesus never came from attribute to word
[57:23] to flesh he was the attribute that's the
[57:31] whole thing of trying to get you see I'm
[57:34] a father I'm a son I'm a human I'm this
[57:36] but I'm still the same person he never
[57:39] came from attribute to word he was the
[57:47] attribute he was the word but Adam came
[57:56] from attribute come on
[58:08] what was his next stage the first stage
[58:11] of atom was what I know I'm gonna get so
[58:15] I'll just bring it up a little part stop
[58:17] okay Adam never come like Jesus in the
[58:26] basis he was the attribute and he was
[58:29] the word and are you listening Adam came
[58:34] from the attribute to flesh he's a
[58:41] winner what are you voting a minute well
[58:42] okay I thought we were had tall and
[58:45] believed it and over and over that
[58:48] Genesis 1:26 and 27
[58:51] now we're only speaking of Adam today
[58:54] we're not talking about the whole thing
[58:56] we'll cover that later but speaking of
[58:58] Adam how did Adam come but arrested he
[59:02] comes from attribute to fit flesh to be
[59:07] tempted you see we'll see I know what
[59:12] your mind is gonna run and we had some
[59:14] of it lies not talking about see you're
[59:16] gonna run to Adam and you're gonna say
[59:18] that Adam couldn't do wrong well I'm
[59:22] gonna remind you he D now you can argue
[59:26] that all you won't even do it all by
[59:33] herself right come on
[59:39] but listen Adam brother instead come
[59:45] from attribute cuz he said you and had
[59:46] them come from attribute to flesh to be
[59:50] tempted okay
[59:53] Adams first beginning of ever what you
[59:56] want to talk about him being would be
[59:58] talking about Genesis 1:26 and 27 when
[1:00:01] he'd say let us make man in our own
[1:00:03] image all right now what kind of a man
[1:00:06] did God make he made a spirit man he
[1:00:11] made man in His image
[1:00:13] now we're only talking about Adam I said
[1:00:15] hold that hold it with me you out there
[1:00:18] anything he's good another message we'll
[1:00:20] cover more in two
[1:00:21] us but hold with me today because you'll
[1:00:24] never get to talk Adam came from
[1:00:31] attribute
[1:00:32] what was it attribute let us make man
[1:00:37] hurt he come from Adam attribute to
[1:00:44] flesh to be tempted didn't let us make
[1:00:48] man huh Adam came as close as could be
[1:00:58] to the right way now I want you to get
[1:01:06] this thought reading said all this back
[1:01:07] up right here on the top you realize the
[1:01:13] way Jesus came was the condescending of
[1:01:15] God okay now listen listen and don't
[1:01:20] quote me wrong the plan and purpose when
[1:01:25] it fell to mankind you got to go to Adam
[1:01:29] to find out what's taking place because
[1:01:33] Jesus Christ condescended down to earth
[1:01:39] all right you realize that Jesus Christ
[1:01:44] now listen Jesus Christ just the point
[1:01:49] away he descended if we had to come that
[1:01:53] way we could have never fallen come on
[1:02:00] Jesus Christ never failed are you with
[1:02:06] me if we become like Jesus we hadn't
[1:02:10] ever fallen even the way Adam come Adam
[1:02:14] come to where it says he was not
[1:02:16] deceived but he fell
[1:02:27] but I said there's got to be a dead
[1:02:29] little difference between the way Jesus
[1:02:31] condescended because even though he
[1:02:33] could be tempted of Satan and all of the
[1:02:35] things when he was put into flesh he
[1:02:37] would not fall right by becomes you
[1:02:46] would Almighty God but when God started
[1:02:52] his attributes to come in to be
[1:02:56] displayed if it is out spring Adam was
[1:03:02] made the most perfect way that could
[1:03:05] have ever been to were that it would
[1:03:11] bring out finally the full attributes of
[1:03:16] God
[1:03:16] now rot that thought down you write a
[1:03:20] lot of other things sometimes I tell you
[1:03:22] to write down your thoughts you don't
[1:03:23] write them if you write what you're
[1:03:24] thinking and missing what I'm saying
[1:03:26] right that thought damn Adam came the
[1:03:33] way God wanted all of his children to
[1:03:36] come are you listening Reed who is this
[1:03:45] Melchizedek had we come as Jesus Christ
[1:03:50] came we would have never been tempted
[1:03:52] and fallen so he had to I don't know
[1:03:59] what's the word for he had to lower down
[1:04:00] he had to drop down a notch he had to
[1:04:05] make a little difference between this
[1:04:06] and this I don't know what words to use
[1:04:10] I don't have no education you take a
[1:04:12] ninth grade education to try to tell
[1:04:14] people about thoughts and things and
[1:04:16] they lies - what if he nobody theophany
[1:04:18] I can read but are you listening Jesus
[1:04:28] came straight down the line through the
[1:04:33] word into Melchizedek and walked out on
[1:04:37] the earth in Jesus Christ
[1:04:39] now come on Adam didn't come this away
[1:04:42] and then drop down in another person and
[1:04:44] appear through this other person who
[1:04:45] didn't finally come on come on Adam came
[1:04:52] from attribute the thoughts of God as to
[1:04:56] what he would be he stepped into a
[1:05:02] wonderful position because when he said
[1:05:08] let us make man what a great position
[1:05:13] that would be talking about that a human
[1:05:17] mortal could comprehend think about even
[1:05:22] of being in the image of Almighty God
[1:05:31] but now watch him see Adam has got to
[1:05:34] come from attribute to flesh to be
[1:05:39] tempted right come on Jesus come
[1:05:48] straight across into flesh showing that
[1:05:52] he was Almighty God the whole time and
[1:05:54] he didn't matter what the temptation
[1:05:55] come he wasn't gonna fall now had even
[1:05:59] Adam been made that way Adam would not
[1:06:07] have fallen
[1:06:15] though Adam comes from attribute what is
[1:06:19] the attribute let us make my animal is
[1:06:25] that the displaying God's attributes is
[1:06:27] that is the attributes of God to be his
[1:06:29] children his offspring see we talk about
[1:06:32] attributes as being healer Savior etc
[1:06:34] well why not think about him as father
[1:06:37] you know father is one of the attributes
[1:06:40] right you know that son is one of the
[1:06:44] attributes of God brother branham said
[1:06:47] it he was to be son that was one of
[1:06:54] these attributes he was to be father
[1:06:57] that was one of the attributes he could
[1:06:59] have created Adam and been father he
[1:07:08] never made him wrong they'll never get
[1:07:13] that in your mind and he made him wrong
[1:07:15] well I can't help it that's what my
[1:07:17] brother said to Methodist preacher about
[1:07:19] twelve years of college he said God
[1:07:21] can't blame me for being wrong called he
[1:07:23] made me wrong I said he didn't make you
[1:07:26] like you are you made yourself like you
[1:07:28] are then you're blaming God for it
[1:07:31] that's not true but listen you come like
[1:07:39] Adam like me you become from the
[1:07:42] attribute to the flesh to be tempted I'm
[1:07:47] coming down to where we're getting to
[1:07:51] Adam see then attribute let us make man
[1:07:58] in our own image he made that man now
[1:08:05] listen that man that he made of Genesis
[1:08:10] 1:26 and 27
[1:08:12] could not fall now don't get you hold
[1:08:20] man we got to go to Genesis 2:7
[1:08:22] two-volume them a body we got to get
[1:08:25] something else involved into this after
[1:08:27] a while if we have time
[1:08:30] that one 26 and 27
[1:08:34] within the image of God and God can't
[1:08:36] fall so there's no way to make that one
[1:08:40] 26 man fall well we've got work the
[1:08:46] Prophet said Adam fail that's right
[1:08:49] we'll get to that
[1:08:50] did Adam fall from eternal life if he
[1:08:53] did he went to hell now what do you got
[1:08:54] you go ahead you don't listen and you
[1:09:01] say well that's your idea well let's
[1:09:03] hear yours I'm open my doors never this
[1:09:07] now stuck about 3/4 closed any time you
[1:09:11] want to come in there and we'll talk
[1:09:12] about it cuz I'm gonna tell you what I
[1:09:17] believe and then you make up your mind
[1:09:19] whether or not that's the truth or not
[1:09:21] but listen jerk Adam came listen if God
[1:09:34] was the word right now come on
[1:09:41] you have to listen with me for a minute
[1:09:44] God was the word his first form from
[1:09:50] taking from eternity you know the
[1:09:52] beginning in the beginning that he was a
[1:09:54] quote right here in the beginning before
[1:09:56] the eternal that's that's in this who is
[1:09:58] this melchester and there he was he
[1:10:02] condescended to word a theophany word to
[1:10:11] create Jesus Christ you know became he
[1:10:16] was the word all right now if Adam was
[1:10:19] in the image of God
[1:10:21] what was that him created brother Brian
[1:10:27] calls him a spirit man can I call him
[1:10:30] this and get by with you on it he was a
[1:10:33] word man he was part of the word
[1:10:38] because he's part of God if he's in the
[1:10:41] image of God didn't why you got trouble
[1:10:43] with him being God in human flesh
[1:10:45] Adam was eternal life in his soul right
[1:10:49] blasphemous names we'll get to it
[1:10:51] eventually
[1:10:54] brother Brown said pre-breathe
[1:10:56] especially into Adam eternal life he
[1:10:58] became an eternal person with God now
[1:11:01] that's blasphemous names I've preached
[1:11:04] it forty years some of you ordered list
[1:11:06] you could holler Amen for forty years
[1:11:07] ago or something listen Adam this is
[1:11:14] what I'm trying to tell you you say well
[1:11:15] you're just saying the same thing over
[1:11:17] and over we just moved up a notch now
[1:11:19] did you move with me we just moved up a
[1:11:25] notch we just stepped up a step higher
[1:11:29] than we've ever preached before that
[1:11:37] Adam that man of one 26 or 27 was a
[1:11:42] spirit man in the image of God it was
[1:11:48] the world that Adam was to be now
[1:11:52] remember what I said Adam was God's
[1:11:57] original plan take away the fall take
[1:12:02] away all the things Adam would have been
[1:12:05] God's original plan for all the children
[1:12:09] of God to come forth which Adam would
[1:12:16] have been the one 26 man he was put over
[1:12:21] the garden to lead the animals he was in
[1:12:25] theophany now come on am i right page 80
[1:12:29] the Hebrew book that's why your soul is
[1:12:32] your theophany but you ain't gonna
[1:12:33] listen to that you're gonna still hang
[1:12:35] to your old days of thinking what if the
[1:12:37] often he is and the soul is and you're
[1:12:40] not gonna listen but I'm gonna keep
[1:12:42] hollering until the day I die or lose my
[1:12:44] voice somebody's gonna get this this is
[1:12:47] 40 almost 50 years that I've been
[1:12:49] preaching this well I ain't worried
[1:12:51] about
[1:12:51] ain't you worried about somebody coming
[1:12:54] and challenge you it's out there on the
[1:12:55] internet come and show me where I'm
[1:12:58] wrong you said that's sarcastic no that
[1:13:02] ain't sarcastic
[1:13:03] that's just plain language code if I'm
[1:13:06] wrong and you tell me I'm wrong and show
[1:13:09] me where I'm wrong that I can be helped
[1:13:11] right so I can't lose see if I'm right
[1:13:18] then you're gonna be proved to be wrong
[1:13:20] but if I'm wrong and you correct me I'm
[1:13:23] gonna be proved to be wrong
[1:13:24] and I can get rid of it so I can't lose
[1:13:32] Thank You silly I agree with you but I
[1:13:35] enjoy it himself
[1:13:37] yeah what are you following me Adam came
[1:13:43] straight from attribute to flesh now
[1:13:47] come on Genesis 1:26 and 27 he was
[1:13:51] created as spiritual being eternal life
[1:13:55] 2:7 I guess it is right before that to
[1:13:58] seven to seven rather rather explained
[1:14:02] it they said what is the difference
[1:14:04] between the man of 1:26 and the man of
[1:14:07] 2:7 you remember that the question
[1:14:09] brethren said to 1:26 man would put in
[1:14:13] to the 2:7 man he breathed into the
[1:14:21] nostrils of a body that was created
[1:14:26] coming to flesh to be tempted he was put
[1:14:35] in that flash the 1:26 man the eternal
[1:14:39] life was put in that flat blasphemous
[1:14:41] nine brethren said it was eternal life
[1:14:43] that was breathed into his nostrils come
[1:14:45] on I've got it here no in the message
[1:14:47] anytime you want these things you just
[1:14:49] holler I'll be their blasphemous names
[1:14:53] take it for 180 for Jehovah Witness
[1:14:58] believe that a talking about a breathing
[1:15:00] that's your you breathe that you're like
[1:15:02] it's not what you breathe
[1:15:04] your soul cuz if that's what they
[1:15:07] believe they believe that you you
[1:15:09] breathe out you breathe in said an
[1:15:10] animal breathes out and breathe in so
[1:15:12] it's just a soul listen to what he says
[1:15:14] but what God did he breathed the breath
[1:15:16] of eternal life then he became a living
[1:15:19] soul a soul that can't die now remember
[1:15:24] that when brother Brown said Adam died
[1:15:29] and you'll see he's not telling you two
[1:15:32] different things could Adam never died
[1:15:35] and so he died in body listen now watch
[1:15:40] we're going to get into honey plum to
[1:15:43] our elbows notice breathe the breath of
[1:15:46] eternal life into the nostrils and he
[1:15:49] became an eternal soul cause God
[1:15:52] breathed not what nature buried but
[1:15:58] around called him in that an eternal
[1:15:59] ocean an eternal person but listen so
[1:16:09] Adam in his first creation as a spirit
[1:16:13] man was also the part of the word that
[1:16:16] he was to be this is for later okay
[1:16:20] this is maybe a dozen message down the
[1:16:23] road see you're part of one 26 and 27 is
[1:16:27] it as part of the scripture that you are
[1:16:29] how many times have I asked you the
[1:16:31] question many times if I said to you is
[1:16:35] there any one certain scripture that
[1:16:37] means more to you than the other
[1:16:41] scriptures and you know it's always odd
[1:16:43] is hardly ever there's hardly ever we
[1:16:46] ask it here one not two went through a
[1:16:48] whole group of people standing up and
[1:16:49] telling they're rich and hardly anybody
[1:16:51] quoted the same scripture because it's
[1:16:54] not to be what is your scripture weight
[1:16:59] says 1:26 and 27 here what's yours
[1:17:01] what's next
[1:17:08] you know mine don't you what let me
[1:17:13] never remember my scripture the thing
[1:17:17] God spoke to me about before I ever
[1:17:19] heard of this message before I ever
[1:17:22] heard of anything about it a good old
[1:17:24] formal bad dish and I went to my wife
[1:17:29] when I read Dawson I said well if I'm a
[1:17:30] Christian I need to be read the Bible
[1:17:33] his word I read the Bible and when I got
[1:17:35] over to Malachi 4 I read 3 and I read 4
[1:17:39] and I went to my wife and I said
[1:17:40] according the way I read that's gonna be
[1:17:42] 2 prophets coming for the end of the
[1:17:44] world ok I couldn't get it straight so
[1:17:50] when brother Moute began to tell me
[1:17:51] about this prophet I said tell me where
[1:17:53] is that in the word he says it's Malachi
[1:17:55] folder well I wanted you know you heard
[1:17:57] me tell I wanted to see where he was
[1:17:59] going to so I said well what about this
[1:18:00] prophet in Malachi 3 because he's Elijah
[1:18:04] mill I got three me and I said you're
[1:18:08] talking about got four were explaining
[1:18:10] this guy he said oh that's John the
[1:18:11] Baptist and he said that's Luke 11730
[1:18:14] that comes over here to the well at
[1:18:17] least I gotta listen to the guy what
[1:18:19] else could argue about what's your
[1:18:22] scripture I said we're talking about
[1:18:26] Adam but we'll get down to each
[1:18:30] individual be cold
[1:18:35] Adam was part of the word let us make
[1:18:39] man now I'll show you the secret before
[1:18:43] we ever get over to it the problem is
[1:18:46] you and I have got to have a new birth
[1:18:49] before we can talk about the one 26 and
[1:18:52] 27
[1:18:53] right I said a little difference between
[1:18:58] this and a little difference between
[1:18:59] that so we're getting the whole plan of
[1:19:02] redemption but listen you come like Adam
[1:19:09] he said Adam came from
[1:19:15] watch now brother branham said Adam and
[1:19:19] Eve was one in theophany you remember
[1:19:22] that and the question is an answer you
[1:19:24] remember the eve was left in theophany
[1:19:26] and Adam was put in flesh and Eve was
[1:19:29] still in theophany questions and answers
[1:19:31] right then he said Adam was lonely he
[1:19:36] said then he took and said Eve was a
[1:19:39] part of Adam and theophany said she's
[1:19:42] part of Adam and now why can't you see
[1:19:46] what he's saying when he says your soul
[1:19:49] is your theophany when you step out of
[1:19:57] this body you don't step into another
[1:20:01] body
[1:20:04] that's transmigration heard of random
[1:20:07] emphatic mistakes in this church age
[1:20:10] book that he doesn't believe in
[1:20:11] transmigration transmigration means
[1:20:13] going from one body to another body he
[1:20:15] doesn't believe in it neither does he
[1:20:19] believe in reincarnation would you say
[1:20:25] what are you talking about I'm talking
[1:20:27] about a man named Adam that appeared on
[1:20:29] earth 6,000 years ago was God's original
[1:20:33] plan forever child that he was to ever
[1:20:36] have would have been that that would
[1:20:41] have been in the way every one of us
[1:20:43] would have come simple to me all he had
[1:20:52] to do was bring Adam and Eve blow the
[1:20:57] devil out of the way keep him off the
[1:20:58] same can't work ain't nothing it's
[1:21:00] brought Adam and Eve in in Adam and Eve
[1:21:03] could have whatever you want to bring
[1:21:05] the wordings you've used your own
[1:21:06] terminologies they would have brought us
[1:21:09] into being by the spoken word and as
[1:21:15] they did God would have put the part of
[1:21:17] the 1:26 man that you wish to be would
[1:21:20] have put that into you as eternal life
[1:21:23] in your soul
[1:21:27] and the Tree of Life was in the garden
[1:21:29] and we'd all went to the Tree of Life
[1:21:31] and our bodies would have been made
[1:21:34] eternal what the problem was it was
[1:21:37] already in two other tree the tree of
[1:21:40] death was put there because that was not
[1:21:43] going to come that away well get my
[1:21:46] point
[1:21:46] God's original plan plan plan for
[1:21:50] mankind was for every one of us to come
[1:21:53] like Adam did Adam could not fall from
[1:21:58] that eternal life in his soul but he was
[1:22:02] put in a body see I know what you're
[1:22:08] thinking you're saying I don't see how
[1:22:10] you can put eternal life in the soul and
[1:22:12] then let her body fall heaven help you
[1:22:20] any of you had a dirty thought today you
[1:22:25] ever had a little bit of heal something
[1:22:26] come up in you today did you lust after
[1:22:28] something today did you do anything like
[1:22:30] that
[1:22:32] come on be natural did you look at your
[1:22:37] wife this is bathing this morning in
[1:22:39] life tight to her come on you got sin
[1:22:44] then now do you understand what I'm
[1:22:47] trying to say a born-again believer is
[1:22:51] not a person set aside from sin when you
[1:22:55] do that you're in the devil's trap and
[1:22:57] he's got you oh I can't saying I'm a
[1:23:00] born-again Christian the devil's done
[1:23:04] got you deceived don't ever think you
[1:23:08] can't sin because that's what I had them
[1:23:12] done and Adam was the word remember Eve
[1:23:18] was deceived Adam wouldn't deceive he
[1:23:21] knew exactly what he's doing exactly
[1:23:27] what he was doing he was to see she
[1:23:29] still thought she's right don't ever
[1:23:34] think that you can't do wrong you're in
[1:23:37] the devil's trap
[1:23:39] well that wouldn't leave that was a
[1:23:41] devil oh wait a minute
[1:23:43] have you ever heard that one that wasn't
[1:23:44] me that was the devil well that means
[1:23:46] the devil's in you if it you've flipped
[1:23:48] it on you now where you got it you gonna
[1:23:51] put the devil in God's than you sold
[1:23:52] together no way folks come on don't ever
[1:24:02] think that you can't do wrong because
[1:24:05] that right there is the worst sin that
[1:24:08] there is is to think you can't do wrong
[1:24:13] as a Christian I don't know if no other
[1:24:19] sin would be greater than that
[1:24:20] that got killed in 58 people after the
[1:24:24] best thing he ever done he was the
[1:24:25] fifty-ninth one he just took his own
[1:24:28] life but a man doing that that ain't
[1:24:33] seeing according to your prophet now
[1:24:37] come on drinking gambling all this out
[1:24:40] in the other so killing people and all
[1:24:42] these other that's not sin the sin is
[1:24:47] sitting in the pews of the church
[1:24:48] thinking that you're not a sinner when
[1:24:52] you're turning down the world
[1:24:53] I thought sin was to disbelieve God's
[1:24:57] Word oh now you're getting technical
[1:25:03] brother Dale you're trying to make me
[1:25:07] afraid honey we lost being afraid a long
[1:25:11] time ago our children are not afraid of
[1:25:15] God because we've lost the point of
[1:25:19] trying to direct them as to be afraid of
[1:25:21] a Living God
[1:25:30] so now we're gonna have to pick up and
[1:25:32] we're gonna bring Adam some more and
[1:25:33] then we'll talk about how you can
[1:25:39] because remember we didn't come 1 26 and
[1:25:44] 27
[1:25:45] mm-hmm let me state again in a hurry
[1:25:49] were to be Jesus Christ became the word
[1:25:54] there's the theophany --the the word
[1:25:58] there's the speech the logos to create
[1:26:01] her he stood there like I said if you've
[1:26:03] seen him standing he was standing
[1:26:05] looking like Hoffman's closed like
[1:26:07] brother branham's bit a man standing
[1:26:09] there saying let there be but see we
[1:26:13] look at him as a spirit or something no
[1:26:15] no no no no that's where you're wrong
[1:26:22] you say yeah but Abraham Abraham
[1:26:25] couldn't see the one that was dark I'm
[1:26:28] glad you thought of that then Abraham
[1:26:30] couldn't see the one that was there
[1:26:31] because he's inside of him I'm glad you
[1:26:34] thought of that
[1:26:35] but did you think that Moses he didn't
[1:26:40] appear to Moses as a man in a body to
[1:26:43] talk to him he talked to him from a
[1:26:45] burning bush or whatever he was talking
[1:26:47] and then moses said lord i wish i could
[1:26:50] see he said go stand in the rock and
[1:26:53] said when to do when i passed you can
[1:26:55] look and he said he saw the back part of
[1:26:57] my hand and he said that was the
[1:26:59] theophany that moses saw and that was
[1:27:02] the same body jesus was in when he
[1:27:04] walked the shores of Galilee see he came
[1:27:13] word first
[1:27:14] are you listening now Adam came the
[1:27:19] 126th man was only the part of the word
[1:27:22] that he was why listen why would brother
[1:27:28] Branham say Eve wasn't in Adam
[1:27:34] I mean Eve Eve was over here and had him
[1:27:36] was down here
[1:27:39] Eve was still up here nut the offing
[1:27:41] this way Adam was down here why because
[1:27:46] she's got her own word - she's part of
[1:27:50] the one 26 to 27 she's got her own word
[1:27:54] you got the word to be revealed and to
[1:27:59] get us off the hook what see you and I
[1:28:03] we had to bypass every bit of that we
[1:28:07] never come like Adam we never came from
[1:28:12] one 26 and 27 to flesh to be tempted
[1:28:15] that way we bypassed all of that we came
[1:28:19] to the world as sinners we got to get
[1:28:25] the new birth here now the 1:26 and 27
[1:28:28] man is a part of you now we're going
[1:28:30] back towards eternal life now why can't
[1:28:33] you see that your soul is your theophany
[1:28:36] because the very time brother Branham is
[1:28:39] explaining Adam and Eve as the theophany
[1:28:42] and being herb here and him here he goes
[1:28:44] right on he says that's the reason he
[1:28:47] made demand he said because he was
[1:28:50] different from the animals and said he
[1:28:52] put a soul in a man he said cause that
[1:28:54] soul is this theophany when they went
[1:29:00] beyond come on musicians when he went
[1:29:01] beyond the curtain of time souls under
[1:29:03] the altar he said that was theophany why
[1:29:09] can't you see that your soul is your
[1:29:11] theophany why can't you see if you die
[1:29:14] you just step right out of that body and
[1:29:17] you going right onto something else
[1:29:21] right why can't we see these things
[1:29:27] because we don't think I'm going to say
[1:29:31] this and you can take what you want to
[1:29:33] we don't think that there's any man
[1:29:35] capable of telling us anything now after
[1:29:39] brother Branham will take that he can
[1:29:44] tell us cold we can argue over the
[1:29:46] quotes are you in me
[1:29:48] we take brother Branham
[1:29:51] and say he had it but that way you can
[1:29:53] argue over the quotes because you can
[1:29:54] say he said this and he said that he
[1:29:56] said isn't he said that but you don't
[1:29:58] think anybody today could speak the Word
[1:30:02] of God and it'd be rocked you say yeah
[1:30:12] but you're using hey I'm not talking
[1:30:14] about one or two people I'm talking
[1:30:15] about everybody in this church okay
[1:30:17] everybody in this church is that enough
[1:30:22] I'm talking about everybody because you
[1:30:25] don't believe that the man can bring you
[1:30:28] the Word of God I kind of think it's
[1:30:33] just what now who give you the right to
[1:30:35] think well that's just your way of
[1:30:42] seeing it we went through that and
[1:30:43] organized religion folks let's tan
[1:30:47] turn the page sorry to be a little you
[1:30:50] know I was I hope you see what I'm
[1:30:53] talking about
[1:30:57] we'll get to the point
[1:31:01] of you and I and our descending
[1:31:06] just remember Oh
