[28:13] all the way back from the beginning

[28:22] i thought i turned that thing on when i

[28:31] thank you it's more for them all y'all
[28:33] up here in the front gets the blessing
[28:34] of my loud voice anyway
[28:36] so the ones in the back maybe are not
[28:39] but uh
[28:40] that's okay yeah i know good to be in
[28:43] the house with lord good to see
[28:44] everybody
[28:45] downstairs was full this morning i don't
[28:47] know about this afternoon but uh
[28:50] good to be back here gonna take
[28:51] communion today and we'll discuss that
[28:53] at the end because if i tell you now
[28:54] you'll forget
[28:56] so we'll talk about it before we get
[28:59] ready to leave if you got your bibles
[29:00] let's turn to first john
[29:02] where we were before the last few times
[29:05] we're still talking about two spirits
[29:08] today we're going to speak on the spoken
[29:10] word
[29:10] seed spoken word
[29:14] seed everything originated
[29:18] from the spoken word everything
[29:22] even lucifer originated from the spoken
[29:26] seed word amen because what
[29:29] is a seed the word of god
[29:33] according to the book of mark sower went
[29:35] out to sow
[29:37] and the word was the seed but we'll get
[29:40] into where god had to split that thing
[29:42] though and bring natural seed in
[29:45] okay because he had to bring natural
[29:46] seed everything was spoken by the
[29:48] original seed
[29:50] didn't need another seed it had to
[29:51] originate somewhere there was first a
[29:53] seed of something
[29:55] that originated from the mouth of god
[29:59] it didn't originate from anywhere else
[30:00] if he's the creator he created every
[30:02] seed that ever was and ever will be
[30:05] on the face of the earth all right so
[30:07] now remember
[30:08] that today after the second service
[30:09] we'll be taking communion
[30:12] and remember brother louise will be
[30:14] speaking wednesday night so good
[30:16] good to be in the house of lord good to
[30:18] see everybody it's just a refreshing
[30:20] time you know i
[30:22] i don't see how you can miss church when
[30:23] the doors are open
[30:25] it's just a fire in your heart that it
[30:27] burns
[30:28] and
[30:33] it's just part of what you are it's that
[30:36] seed
[30:37] the word talking to the word amen
[30:40] first john four verse one
[30:43] talking about two spirits this is part
[30:45] five spoken word
[30:47] seed we'll try to get down into remember
[30:50] we were before
[30:52] we spoke on before the beginning
[30:56] now we're down here to where we see let
[30:58] there be
[31:00] and and i i enjoyed wednesday night if
[31:02] you didn't if you didn't hear wings do
[31:04] not service you ought to hear it
[31:06] ma'am because it really gives you a uh
[31:09] a little more perspective of what light
[31:11] is that we don't need the sun
[31:13] anymore once we get over into the future
[31:15] home we don't need it anymore so it's
[31:18] and it's not temporary it's going to be
[31:20] there
[31:21] but we won't need it we won't need to
[31:24] wait till in the morning till the sun
[31:25] comes up for us to get like no
[31:28] light's always going to be in that city
[31:30] that city will be illuminated for
[31:31] millions and hundreds of thousands of
[31:33] you if you
[31:34] if we go off to another planet brothers
[31:36] act we go off to the milky way and we
[31:38] can look back we'll still see that city
[31:40] hey ma'am if we can travel like a
[31:43] thought we ought to be able to
[31:44] amen we'll be able to observe that what
[31:46] is that light that light
[31:48] comes from me and you jesus told the
[31:50] people said you're the light of the
[31:51] world
[31:53] ye are the light of the world because
[31:55] when we leave this place the only light
[31:57] that's going to be in the world is going
[31:58] to be a little small
[31:59] dot of 144 000. why did brother branham
[32:02] draw the
[32:03] the the angel draw the chart and it
[32:05] showed the white and the black
[32:06] in each church age the white being what
[32:08] light
[32:10] and the darkness being the black all
[32:12] right so the angel was telling brother
[32:14] branham
[32:15] you're right on i mean when an angel
[32:17] comes by and draws the same thing you've
[32:19] been preaching on the wall
[32:22] pretty good confirmation to me but the
[32:25] most confirmation is is you can see it
[32:26] in the word
[32:28] if you can see it in the word you know
[32:30] that that that could be done and it
[32:32] could be imitated
[32:33] but you can't imitate it connecting
[32:36] with the word that's why i believe that
[32:38] light was so great back in the beginning
[32:40] that it's just
[32:40] to me that's illumination that's
[32:42] revelation that's a light that goes on
[32:45] your goes off in your brain or in your
[32:48] soul when when god brings a revelation
[32:50] to you because
[32:51] we love revelation we're revelation
[32:53] people so as we get revelation
[32:56] to me that's more of the spark that we
[32:58] need
[32:59] to get through life amen
[33:02] so let's bow our heads before we get
[33:05] started
[33:06] pray for each other pray for these ones
[33:08] um like i said we
[33:10] spoke to brother jason jackson yesterday
[33:12] or text your brother jason he
[33:14] he has the virus and a good many people
[33:16] in his church
[33:17] so we want to remember them especially
[33:20] sister sheila mccommons now some of you
[33:22] may know brother frank
[33:24] a commons he's from uh out there
[33:27] and um a real good brother his sister i
[33:29] mean his wife has real
[33:31] she's had problems with her lungs before

[35:19] be brother jason jackson sister sheila
[35:20] mccombs different ones
[35:22] lord that we call by name lord all the
[35:25] time in our mind that
[35:26] satan has tried to he's trying to keep
[35:28] the bride apart because he knows if
[35:30] she'll get a true revelation as we're
[35:32] gonna
[35:33] read a quote here in a few minutes lord
[35:35] that we've been reading that if you'll
[35:36] get a true revelation of what's going on
[35:38] lord
[35:38] we know satan loves to divide and
[35:40] conquer but lord
[35:42] we know the greaters he that's in us
[35:43] than he that's in the world
[35:45] greater is he that's here lord as you
[35:47] said through your prophet you said you
[35:49] the word is a seed and every word of
[35:52] promise
[35:53] can be taken whole by the bride for
[35:56] healing for salvation
[35:58] for deliverance for all the things that
[35:59] we need it's laying right there in the
[36:01] word of god
[36:03] but if it just lays there
[36:06] it's no good we must put it in good
[36:09] ground we must water it with good water
[36:11] we must
[36:12] do the things that we need to do to get
[36:13] that seed to produce father
[36:15] i pray that everyone in the building and
[36:17] with the sound of our voice lord that
[36:18] you would help us all to grow up more in
[36:20] you lord
[36:22] to elevate our revelation lord higher
[36:24] and higher lord because you're standing
[36:26] there wanting us to give it the prophet
[36:27] that god said
[36:28] more than we're wanting it lord i pray
[36:31] that our want will be more and more for
[36:32] you father
[36:34] be with each one lord take care of the
[36:36] bride around the world
[36:37] bless this day in jesus name amen first
[36:41] john 4 verse 1
[36:42] beloved believe not every spirit but try
[36:44] the spirits whether they are of god
[36:46] because many false prophets are gone out
[36:48] into the world how do we know that
[36:50] brother brown was a true prophet
[36:51] he was vindicated
[36:55] you can lay it everywhere in the word
[36:57] and right there is everything that he
[36:58] said all the things that he's given us
[37:00] is right there all right we don't have
[37:02] to go guest for something else or guest
[37:04] for somebody else
[37:06] even as some have said you know no no no
[37:09] uh
[37:09] who is who is this malachi 3 and who is
[37:12] this malachi 4 well you know the
[37:14] the words real clear john actually told
[37:16] you who he was
[37:18] i am the voice of one crying in the
[37:19] wilderness i'm not the one that's going
[37:21] to be here before
[37:22] the great and dreadful day of the lord
[37:23] so by the process of elimination
[37:26] malachi 3 is not william branham malachi
[37:29] 4
[37:30] because he is restoring back the faith
[37:33] of the fathers
[37:36] back to the original all right and i
[37:38] believe and i can see that in his work
[37:40] that he did restore us back to the
[37:41] original
[37:42] but then he brought a message that had
[37:45] never been brought before
[37:47] a message that man knew nothing about
[37:49] jesus christ himself was the only person
[37:51] that knew anything about it and when he
[37:53] left
[37:54] he said i'm coming back so he's coming
[37:57] back in this end time
[37:59] and gave us the headstone revelation not
[38:02] the cornerstone revelation you've got to
[38:03] have the cornerstone revelation
[38:05] but it takes us to the headstone
[38:07] revelation but
[38:08] hereby know you the spirit of god every
[38:10] spirit that confesses that jesus christ
[38:12] has come in the flesh is of god
[38:13] and every spirit that confesses not that
[38:15] jesus christ has come in the flesh is
[38:17] not of god pretty simple
[38:18] and this is that spirit of antichrist
[38:20] wherever you have heard that it should
[38:22] come
[38:22] and even now already isn't in the world
[38:24] that's 1896
[38:26] year of god little children and have
[38:28] overcome them because greater is he
[38:30] that's in you than he that's in the
[38:31] world
[38:32] they are of the world therefore speak
[38:35] they
[38:36] of the world and the world heareth them
[38:39] we are of god he that knoweth god
[38:44] heareth us he that is not of god heareth
[38:47] not us hereby know we the spirit of
[38:49] truth
[38:50] and the spirit of aaron you may be
[38:52] seated in the lord as blessing to the
[38:53] reading of the word
[38:55] as we were talking uh sister um
[38:58] and i we're talking downstairs it's
[39:00] cletum talking about um
[39:04] different things about uh illuminati and
[39:06] all the different things you know that
[39:08] where is all that well you know what
[39:11] judas hung around
[39:14] until the day of the crucifixion
[39:17] he was there until jesus christ
[39:21] was almost put on the cross and then
[39:24] judas did what he was supposed to do so
[39:26] it's not
[39:26] yeah what are you saying by the way well
[39:28] it's not i believe there's illuminati in
[39:29] this message i hope you're listening now
[39:31] we know you're here
[39:32] but it's just it's two spirits it's not
[39:34] two people
[39:36] it's a spirit of truth and the spirit of
[39:37] error the spirit of error can hang on
[39:39] so long but right at the very end when
[39:42] you see that jesus christ this is my
[39:43] whole thought
[39:44] the seed word of god jesus christ
[39:46] himself is here today
[39:50] not sitting 2 000 years ago in an upper
[39:52] room he's here today
[39:54] and he's here today to separate the same
[39:57] seed
[39:57] that when he was sitting at the table
[39:59] and and they were all asking
[40:01] is it me is it me is it me he said the
[40:04] one that puts the
[40:05] hand in the bowl well my goodness they
[40:06] were all putting their hands in the bowl
[40:10] but judas knew who he was at that time
[40:13] he was being called out
[40:16] by the word itself and the only reason
[40:17] you and i are going to know the
[40:18] difference is
[40:19] the word is going to call it out amen
[40:22] not some human not some quote
[40:24] not cement you are going we are all
[40:27] are going to manifest what seed is in
[40:31] us in this end time amen
[40:34] we're going to have to because it's what
[40:35] it's harvest time it's not time to plant
[40:38] seed
[40:39] now we know there's new ones coming in
[40:40] and we know there's different things
[40:41] going on that there is a young plant
[40:43] growing
[40:46] but there is a maturity there is a time
[40:48] when you have to go
[40:49] out and harvest all that that you
[40:52] planted
[40:53] all right so god has come to a place
[40:54] he's going to harvest
[40:56] everything that he planted he's going to
[40:59] harvest it
[41:00] that's why we're looking at the spoken
[41:02] word
[41:04] seed because remember
[41:07] adam was a spoken word seed
[41:10] the world was the spoken word seed every
[41:13] seed that was laying in the earth was a
[41:15] spoken word seed
[41:16] all right so we're going to get to that
[41:18] in just a second i really enjoyed
[41:20] zoe that was wonderful did a good job i
[41:23] was as good as i've heard on the radio
[41:27] yeah good job get them young
[41:31] get them young before the devil gets
[41:33] them
[41:35] all right so let's look in ezekiel 28. i
[41:37] still want you to remember one thing we
[41:38] are not dealing
[41:39] with a demonic spirit like the world is
[41:42] talking to us about like some hideous
[41:44] coming up here at halloween he's going
[41:46] to be some gross and grotesque
[41:48] beautiful most deceiving age there ever
[41:54] is it's going to be a beautiful demon
[41:56] that's going to try to take our
[41:58] try to take our joy away from us ezekiel
[42:00] 28 verse 11 moreover the word of the
[42:02] lord came unto me saying son of man
[42:04] take up a lamentation upon the king of
[42:06] taurus and say unto him
[42:08] thus saith the lord god thou see list up
[42:10] to some
[42:11] full of wisdom and perfect
[42:15] in beauty thou hast been in eden the
[42:17] garden of god
[42:18] didn't bother him to walk up down the
[42:20] guard same garden that god walked up and
[42:22] down
[42:23] right didn't bother him he was there
[42:26] now has been in guard eden the garden of
[42:28] god every precious stone was not
[42:30] covering the sardius topaz diamond
[42:32] barrel onyx
[42:33] jasper sapphire emerald carbuncle and
[42:35] gold
[42:36] why that's beautiful stones
[42:40] the workmanship of thy tabrets and of
[42:42] thy pipes were prepared and then the day
[42:44] that thou was created
[42:46] so god created lucifer from a spoken
[42:49] word
[42:51] he spoke him into existence that's right
[42:53] amen
[42:55] everybody got a problem anybody got a
[42:56] problem with that he had to come from
[42:57] somewhere
[42:58] and if grant if god's the only
[42:59] originator and he's the only one that
[43:01] can create
[43:02] he created lucifer but this is how he
[43:04] created him though
[43:06] according to ezekiel and according to
[43:07] the other scriptures we've been reading
[43:08] he created him perfect
[43:10] he created him the anointed cherub he
[43:13] created him
[43:14] to be his right-hand man all right how
[43:17] many times did we read that
[43:18] that was where brother brown was telling
[43:20] us that he was his right-hand man he
[43:21] wasn't
[43:22] he wasn't some uh something created way
[43:25] down
[43:26] no he was right here all right
[43:30] and lucifer means light
[43:34] so you got to be careful this is like i
[43:37] said this is the most deceiving age
[43:39] there is
[43:40] that judah's spirit is here today is
[43:42] here what to turn us away from the word
[43:45] of god
[43:46] to keep us from listening to the word of
[43:47] god to keep us from doing the things
[43:49] that we need to do
[43:51] as far as being a christian because you
[43:53] know what
[43:54] satan is religious satan is deceivingly
[43:58] religious
[43:59] all right because it's a religious
[44:01] spirit that we're dealing with
[44:03] not now listen you say well brother what
[44:05] you're you're discounting or discluding
[44:07] all these
[44:08] other spirits no they fall under two
[44:11] like i said before there's god's holy
[44:14] spirit as brother brown said
[44:16] and then there's satan's unholy spirit
[44:18] so whatever
[44:19] god's holy spirit is it's eternal it's
[44:22] right
[44:22] everything's perfect there is nothing
[44:25] wrong with it it has healing it has
[44:27] salvation it has all these different
[44:29] things
[44:29] satan over here on the other hand has
[44:30] all the other you can put prostitution
[44:32] pornography perversion put all that
[44:35] under that but but it heads up to one
[44:37] spirit which is a religious spirit
[44:40] to begin with amen so that's the two
[44:43] spirits we need to look at so let's look
[44:45] at number one let's read this no let's
[44:47] look genesis 1 26 we're going to
[44:49] we're gonna try to get this to this man
[44:51] and how many times have we spoke on this
[44:53] and brother dale's
[44:54] speaking on it this morning is just you
[44:56] know just overlay what
[44:58] what we're doing this afternoon so
[45:02] he preached it a long time before i did
[45:05] a long time
[45:07] as uh some are realizing they listening
[45:10] back in the 80s
[45:11] brother dale's preaching on the seals
[45:13] that we're just we're just redoing this
[45:15] this we're just going back again
[45:18] all right listen the word of god is just
[45:21] going back over
[45:22] there's no new there's no new rabbit
[45:25] trail we got to go down sure we find
[45:27] different things and we i know brother
[45:29] they'll tell you one thing's for sure
[45:30] he's got more
[45:31] revelation now than he did in 1982 but
[45:34] it's based on
[45:37] what that is what was preached then it's
[45:39] based on
[45:40] what faith this whole pyramid is based
[45:42] on faith brother brown said this whole
[45:44] sermon today is based on one thing
[45:45] that's faith
[45:47] all right so we some of you may have
[45:49] heard this before but
[45:51] we want to give it a little update you
[45:53] know i
[45:54] i like to drive an old car brother
[45:56] donny's got some old
[45:57] old old model a's and multi
[46:01] model a's you didn't have a
[46:05] gps in the model a you got a map
[46:09] physical map so you see what we're
[46:11] talking about now we're updating
[46:12] as man has updated his revelation
[46:16] where we got gps's now in your phone
[46:18] that you got on your on your arm right
[46:20] there you got
[46:20] you got gps my goodness we needed one
[46:24] this big almost when we first got
[46:26] started but
[46:27] not anymore so as as satan
[46:31] satan can pull nothing over on god
[46:34] god's always used the gps
[46:37] god's always been wireless he's always
[46:40] been wi-fi
[46:42] what god ain't never needed a wire to
[46:44] plug anything in to contact you
[46:46] no why he speaks to you what from
[46:49] from him to through the airwaves right
[46:51] into your heart
[46:52] amen but see so does the devil the devil
[46:55] slips right in and does the same thing
[46:57] so we have to be careful with that so
[46:58] let's read genesis 1 26
[47:00] this is the culmination of what we're
[47:02] going to get to maybe today
[47:04] and god said let us make man in our
[47:06] image after our likeness and let them
[47:07] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[47:09] and over the fowl the air and over the
[47:10] cattle
[47:11] and over all the earth and every
[47:12] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[47:14] earth
[47:14] so god created man in his own image as
[47:16] brother dale said this morning
[47:19] this is what the listen to this big word
[47:22] i'm fixing to say
[47:23] this is what the multiplicity of god
[47:25] looks like
[47:28] it's right here we are the very
[47:31] woven genetic being if you're born again
[47:34] today
[47:35] you are woven in the image of this man
[47:37] right here
[47:39] because if he's your father i don't look
[47:42] like brother ray
[47:44] i look like my dad why because i came
[47:46] from that seed
[47:48] of genetic and we'll talk about in a few
[47:51] minutes about the law of reproduction
[47:53] every seed has to bring forth of its
[47:56] kind it can't bring forth anything
[47:57] different
[47:59] so then we must look like our father
[48:01] what adam looked like adam look like god
[48:06] you know like his daddy didn't he what
[48:07] else did he look like he didn't
[48:09] you know uh but i'm sure we're gonna see
[48:11] in just a few minutes when the natural
[48:13] seed split down here on the earth
[48:15] cain didn't look like abel
[48:18] why two different daddies
[48:22] why two different seeds
[48:25] physical now let's get let's stay
[48:27] spiritual now
[48:28] because the spoken word is the original
[48:31] seed the original condition
[48:32] as brother dale's talking about the
[48:34] beginning of the creation of god
[48:36] it happened to be spoken word
[48:39] seed not seed of man not even the seed
[48:43] of
[48:44] eve i mean mary personally
[48:49] she did not give see you see what that
[48:53] is you
[48:53] you you think about that if she would
[48:56] have given the
[48:57] the egg then that wouldn't have been the
[49:00] body of god
[49:01] that would have been a genetic makeup of
[49:04] eve
[49:05] coming from whatever down the line
[49:08] genetically
[49:09] [Music]
[49:11] no god created both egg
[49:14] and sperm put them together and planted
[49:18] them in mary
[49:19] by speaking the word not by a sensation
[49:23] by
[49:23] speaking the word of god and it brought
[49:26] forth exactly
[49:27] where it originated from amen
[49:31] you and i by the new birth yes
[49:34] go back to the original i was thinking
[49:37] that the other day you know
[49:38] me and josh was talking about it takes
[49:40] four thousand four thousand different
[49:42] people
[49:43] you know brother brown said god bred
[49:45] this one to this one
[49:46] listen what came first your humanity
[49:50] your human dna
[49:53] or the dna god saw you back before the
[49:55] foundations of the world
[49:57] listen i'm off my subject here but let's
[49:59] get on this one for a minute
[50:00] when brother rhino said god took a
[50:02] picture of you and put it in an album
[50:05] now
[50:08] you weren't even anything at that time
[50:13] it had to be the theophany
[50:16] hello it had to be the theophany
[50:19] it wasn't your flesh body it came later
[50:25] listen to the great designer let me tell
[50:27] you how good he is
[50:29] he took that image and he took
[50:32] four five six eight ten thousand people
[50:35] had to come together
[50:38] physically physical seed and
[50:42] and and um egg
[50:45] to match that image of me
[50:48] or you or anybody else
[50:52] what a mighty god when he took that
[50:54] picture it had to come that way
[50:56] brother brown said god bread this one to
[50:58] this one this one this one think about
[50:59] all the crazy way you got here and how
[51:01] you grandma you don't even know how your
[51:02] great-great-great-grandma got here
[51:05] why because god listen the master
[51:09] the master scientist knew he didn't have
[51:12] to look in a
[51:13] he didn't have to look at a microscope
[51:15] by the louise to see what your dna was
[51:17] he already put it there it was in his
[51:20] mind
[51:22] he was able to project that image of you
[51:24] 20 years old
[51:26] and then he waited for 6 000 years
[51:31] to get mr mr rego together
[51:34] to produce that image because that's
[51:37] what you're going to look like you're
[51:38] not going to look any different what you
[51:39] are now
[51:43] think about think about
[51:46] listen think about all the trouble god
[51:48] went through which god don't go through
[51:50] trouble
[51:51] but think about all the trouble that god
[51:52] went through just to get you here
[51:56] knowing that you would want it so bad
[51:58] until he would make what
[52:00] that peace match
[52:05] the piece has got a match you got to
[52:08] come in the image of your mom and daddy
[52:10] sure but somewhere in there if you're a
[52:12] son and daughter of god
[52:13] that image has got to match what god put
[52:16] in that book
[52:17] before the foundation of the world
[52:19] before michael and
[52:20] and satan fought before there was a
[52:23] world for you to stand
[52:24] on
[52:28] you know why because you're the very
[52:32] german nation of that person
[52:39] i come from god i'm going back to god
[52:43] okay i came from my mom and daddy though
[52:46] but brother brown said you got to
[52:47] realize
[52:49] that before the foundation of the world
[52:51] if you have new birth tonight that
[52:52] before the foundation of the world
[52:54] that eternal life always was with god
[52:56] well what was it you saw no
[52:58] that picture it's woven in his
[53:02] you couldn't find me in inside of daddy
[53:04] you couldn't find me inside but i was in
[53:06] my great grandpa
[53:07] according to the prophet of god that's
[53:09] right yeah not a little wiggling sperm
[53:12] running around in his body
[53:14] in genetic makeup that's why man broke
[53:17] into god's laboratory with genetics they
[53:19] can do a lot of things now
[53:20] they can tell you now whether you're
[53:22] susceptible to cancer or susceptible to
[53:24] diabetes
[53:25] what your family's history is why
[53:29] by dna
[53:33] why can't we realize that we're the dna
[53:36] of almighty god
[53:38] we had to come here a different dna but
[53:40] that dna has got to match
[53:42] what god saw before the foundation of
[53:44] the world
[53:45] but now look a sinner
[53:49] don't have to happen because he never
[53:50] saw him like that
[53:53] he just came on earth because of the law
[53:54] of reproduction
[53:56] and god gave him a spirit i didn't i
[53:58] don't say have to but he does
[54:01] because satan knew if he could get two
[54:03] people together
[54:05] in the garden he can make something
[54:09] you understand what i'm saying if he
[54:11] could get two people together and
[54:12] inject a natural seed into the god would
[54:15] have to give it life
[54:17] he had to give cain life he had to give
[54:21] able life because of the law of
[54:22] reproduction so let's let's think about
[54:24] that just kind of mull that around in
[54:25] your mind
[54:26] let's go to the exposition of the church
[54:28] ages
[54:33] now remember this christ in the true
[54:35] church is a continuation of the book of
[54:37] acts
[54:38] but the book of revelation shows how
[54:39] that the antichrist spirit would come
[54:40] into the church and defile it
[54:42] make it lukewarm formal and powerless it
[54:45] exposes satan
[54:47] revealing his work attempt the
[54:48] destruction of god's people and
[54:49] discrediting of god's word it's what
[54:51] he's doing discrediting the word of god
[54:53] right down to the time he's cast into
[54:55] the lake of fire remember
[54:57] even after even after he can't touch us
[55:00] for a thousand years
[55:03] thousand years he's bound by a chain of
[55:05] circumstance he's bound he can't work
[55:08] god lets him loose just for a little
[55:10] while he still thinks he can defeat us
[55:14] wrong answer right down to the time he
[55:17] is cast into the lake of fire he fights
[55:19] that he
[55:20] cannot stand it he knows that if the
[55:22] people get the true revelation of the
[55:24] true church
[55:25] and what she is and what she stands for
[55:27] and that she can do the greater works
[55:30] she will be an invincible army if they
[55:32] get a true revelation
[55:34] of the two spirits within the framework
[55:36] of the christian church
[55:39] not the demonic that's going on out
[55:41] there listen the demonic out there is
[55:43] just a manifestation
[55:45] that that second spirit
[55:48] or number two spirit is an unholy spirit
[55:52] amen that's why they act the way they do
[55:56] they have an unholy spirit brother brown
[55:58] says even
[55:59] i've got the quote back there where he's
[56:00] talking about women putting on shorts
[56:02] and
[56:03] in bikinis and going out in the world he
[56:05] said it's a spirit that's on them women
[56:08] it's an unholy spirit that's on those
[56:10] women
[56:11] all right so now look listen
[56:14] everything's got a spirit to it
[56:16] everything everything even on one side
[56:19] or the other
[56:20] because even in the holy spirit you've
[56:21] got different manifestations of the holy
[56:23] spirit
[56:24] that works in your life you've got
[56:25] different anointings that
[56:27] god puts on you so satan has the same
[56:29] thing
[56:30] they're just perverted everything he's
[56:31] got is a perversion of what god has
[56:33] because he can't
[56:34] stand and say let there be that's right
[56:38] and he hates that he can't stand it she
[56:41] will be an invincible army if they get a
[56:42] true revelation of the two spirits
[56:44] within the framework of the christian
[56:45] church
[56:46] and by god's spirit discern and
[56:48] withstand the antichrist spirit satan
[56:50] will be
[56:51] powerless before her now remember that's
[56:54] a religious spirit
[56:57] now let's read number two the greatest
[56:58] battle ever fought i cut out some of
[56:59] these so we could get to what we're
[57:01] talking about here
[57:01] today this great first battle that was
[57:03] ever fought began in heaven
[57:05] when michael and his angels fought
[57:06] against lucifer and his angels so now
[57:08] we realize as brother dale was talking
[57:10] this morning that we were going to bring
[57:12] forth today too that michael was not
[57:14] created
[57:16] he was the creator
[57:20] because why would lucifer the right hand
[57:22] man of god why would he want to fight
[57:23] with a third person or
[57:25] something down the line no satan wants
[57:27] to be like god he don't want to be like
[57:29] that guy he wants to be like god
[57:31] so he fought michael and lucifer fought
[57:34] and obviously satan lost all right
[57:37] and it first started the first battle
[57:38] was in heaven so sin did not originate
[57:40] on earth
[57:41] it originated in heaven and then it was
[57:44] thrown down from heaven
[57:45] cast out of heaven to the earth and fell
[57:48] on human beings now remember i said
[57:49] before
[57:50] not into human beings
[57:53] you can be demon possessed
[57:58] okay but you can't be the demon
[58:01] right everybody got that that's pretty
[58:04] simple
[58:05] you're a human being you have the
[58:06] authority to say no
[58:08] or you have the authority to say
[58:12] what brother brown say brother brown
[58:13] said that woman was healed by the time
[58:15] she got to the end of the platform said
[58:17] but the next day or whatever what she
[58:18] said he
[58:19] she loved that spirit so it just came
[58:21] right back to her
[58:23] she allowed it if she just took what
[58:25] brother ryan said
[58:26] and said don't you allow that spirit to
[58:28] come back fight the thing
[58:31] but some people like it i you know i got
[58:33] a sister-in-law that she just loves to
[58:34] be sick
[58:36] she'd have nothing else to complain
[58:38] about but you see that it's a pattern in
[58:40] people they just they'd rather be sick
[58:42] than be well
[58:44] why was he wowzy woo his brother jewel
[58:47] says
[58:49] i don't want to be that way and then it
[58:52] was thrown down from heaven the battle
[58:53] from angels became human battles
[58:56] and satan came to destroy god's creation
[58:59] and what god had created to be for his
[59:01] self
[59:02] he had satan came to destroy this that's
[59:05] what his purpose was
[59:07] was to destroy it then the battle began
[59:09] on earth
[59:10] and begin where in us
[59:13] and has been raging ever since
[59:18] ever since the beginning of time it has
[59:21] been raging
[59:22] but god being the first
[59:25] the original the creator
[59:28] satan can't get above him he
[59:32] wanted satan to get beside him he did
[59:36] right-hand man you do this i want you to
[59:38] do this i want you to do this
[59:41] but what was found in satan was iniquity
[59:43] satan wanted to do more or what he was
[59:45] doing you know
[59:46] and and you know it's just like
[59:49] i'm sure god looked over lucifer they
[59:52] still talk now okay so i can just be all
[59:54] right by saying this
[59:55] he looked over and he said don't do that
[59:57] you shouldn't be doing that
[59:59] and you know what lucifer's saying i'll
[1:00:02] decide what i want to do
[1:00:04] he's not some he did not take headship
[1:00:09] that's why you and i must stay under
[1:00:12] headship we are sheep
[1:00:14] right we have to be led we have to have
[1:00:17] correction we have to be corrected and
[1:00:19] if we're not we're master children
[1:00:21] all right same way with lucifer lucifer
[1:00:24] the bible says until iniquity was found
[1:00:26] in you in your heart in other words god
[1:00:28] knew that lucifer would do what he did
[1:00:30] but he still gave him a choice
[1:00:33] he just like he did cain he said cain if
[1:00:36] you'll do well lucifer if you'll quit
[1:00:37] doing that
[1:00:38] we'll be fine but he couldn't quit
[1:00:42] he kept on going and going and what he
[1:00:44] do he kept getting further
[1:00:46] and further away from god not not not
[1:00:49] distance wise
[1:00:50] but word wise because he started
[1:00:53] creating his own word he could still
[1:00:54] stand right here beside
[1:00:56] the lord jesus and he still he can still
[1:00:58] bring a word to pass
[1:01:00] but what he has to do though is remember
[1:01:02] he has to take what this one says first
[1:01:06] original he has to take that original
[1:01:07] seed to pervert it he can't make a seed
[1:01:10] never can satan say let there be never
[1:01:12] can satan
[1:01:13] listen satan cannot get
[1:01:16] where god won't let him get
[1:01:20] amen satan will never get anywhere
[1:01:23] unless god allows him to get in
[1:01:26] to you me the garden of eden doesn't
[1:01:28] matter where
[1:01:30] right amen but what are we fighting
[1:01:33] today we're fighting spirits folks we're
[1:01:34] not fighting about i said before
[1:01:36] don't don't think that i'm talking about
[1:01:38] any person
[1:01:39] i'm not i'm talking about there's only
[1:01:41] two people we need to deal with
[1:01:43] that's lucifer and god amen
[1:01:47] or the devil or satan never how you want
[1:01:48] to say his name
[1:01:50] but it's the two spirits but remember as
[1:01:53] we begin now
[1:01:55] satan never can create
[1:02:00] amen he can't he can't
[1:02:03] be an original he can't
[1:02:06] any you say well no no sin originates
[1:02:10] from
[1:02:11] bible says sin started in heaven
[1:02:14] when michael and lucifer fought lucifer
[1:02:17] took his angels and came down here
[1:02:19] and didn't press their self into people
[1:02:22] see that's a doctrine brother brown
[1:02:23] covers that doctrine that
[1:02:25] that now they say you know there's some
[1:02:26] denominations say that those people came
[1:02:28] down remember the sons of god saw the
[1:02:30] daughters of men
[1:02:32] and started getting perverted no that
[1:02:35] was
[1:02:35] sex that was that was that was a seed
[1:02:38] that was given in human beings that
[1:02:40] wasn't the seed word of god
[1:02:42] amen it was the sons of god saw the
[1:02:44] daughters of men
[1:02:46] satan what satan
[1:02:49] perverted the beauty that god created
[1:02:56] god didn't create eve ugly brother brown
[1:03:00] said she's the most beautiful woman
[1:03:02] he said but satan knew he could use that
[1:03:06] and that's what he did so he used
[1:03:08] something that was part of the original
[1:03:10] so let's let's go the spoken word is the
[1:03:12] original seed
[1:03:13] let's go to number three all right
[1:03:20] so you want let me let me ask you a
[1:03:21] question
[1:03:24] where did the fall originate
[1:03:28] we always go back to when i even and
[1:03:31] um the beast did their thing and it was
[1:03:35] before that
[1:03:36] that was a manifestation of what had
[1:03:38] already been spoken
[1:03:40] amen and then what happened was is
[1:03:42] lucifer
[1:03:44] come down here to make that fall happen
[1:03:48] god can't make a fall happen but he
[1:03:51] allowed satan to come down here
[1:03:53] and be careful when you read the quote
[1:03:55] where brother brown
[1:03:56] said satan was the woman's designer you
[1:03:59] go to
[1:04:00] um marriage in divorce
[1:04:03] now listen satan didn't create eve
[1:04:07] god created eve created a perfect
[1:04:09] created or beautiful
[1:04:11] but satan looked at that and said i'll
[1:04:14] promise you
[1:04:15] if that ever gets to a man
[1:04:19] i can play with it i'm just like so i'm
[1:04:23] you know you just got to be like the
[1:04:24] devil sometimes you know you say well
[1:04:26] i can't play with that ugly guy over
[1:04:27] there yeah you understand what i'm
[1:04:29] saying i can't
[1:04:30] ah but that girl she's beautiful
[1:04:34] i can tempt her i can get close to her
[1:04:37] what do you think he did with the beast
[1:04:38] he didn't just walk up and say hey me
[1:04:40] and you no no they may have been years
[1:04:43] and years and years
[1:04:44] because there's an interaction between
[1:04:46] eve and the beast and adam even adam and
[1:04:48] the beast because it was the next
[1:04:50] creation close that's what we're going
[1:04:51] to talk about here in a minute
[1:04:53] that next creation that could talk right
[1:04:58] but now i don't think i i don't maybe
[1:05:00] adam did but i don't think eve knew that
[1:05:01] she could reproduce with him because she
[1:05:02] didn't know anything about reproduction
[1:05:05] remember they were naked and no problem
[1:05:07] everything was pure brother brown said a
[1:05:08] holy ghost veil was over them too
[1:05:11] all right but now remember you got to
[1:05:13] think with me here
[1:05:15] the beast was not the beast didn't have
[1:05:18] a soul the beast wasn't a human being
[1:05:19] the beast came from the seed of a beast
[1:05:23] everybody got that amen
[1:05:27] came from god but god
[1:05:30] in continuity as brother brown said in
[1:05:33] creative evolution
[1:05:34] he couldn't skip over no he had to make
[1:05:38] in creative evolution he had to make a
[1:05:40] beast
[1:05:40] he had to make a monkey and then make a
[1:05:42] beast and then make man
[1:05:44] but what he done with man is he put that
[1:05:47] soul of that genesis 1 26
[1:05:48] man that thing that come from god
[1:05:51] because
[1:05:52] think with me here all life is precious
[1:05:55] to god
[1:05:57] but god told us that we could eat meat
[1:05:59] we ought to kill you know what
[1:06:01] you eat nothing you put nothing in your
[1:06:04] mouth
[1:06:05] that didn't die first that's right
[1:06:08] if you eat a raw goldfish it's going to
[1:06:11] die by the time it gets to your belly
[1:06:14] they still do that louise probably did a
[1:06:16] long time ago
[1:06:18] probably you just don't remember right
[1:06:20] it was those times those foggy times
[1:06:21] that you don't remember yeah
[1:06:23] but something's got to die before you
[1:06:27] can eat it
[1:06:30] so what is that life well we know listen
[1:06:32] we can get all this
[1:06:34] hui dewey about um cabbage and
[1:06:38] vegetables and it's got life
[1:06:41] but it ain't got life like a deer's got
[1:06:43] a life or a cow's got a life okay
[1:06:45] but it's life because god told him
[1:06:47] originally before the fall he said you
[1:06:49] can eat of all the herbs of the ground
[1:06:51] and
[1:06:52] the things of the tree and the nuts and
[1:06:54] the fruits and all that
[1:06:55] but then after the fall happened
[1:06:57] remember he said now you can eat meat
[1:07:00] because i think because i think god's
[1:07:03] setting up what we need
[1:07:04] i mean how we gonna i don't know if i
[1:07:07] could never be a vegetarian
[1:07:08] i just couldn't ever
[1:07:12] be a vegetarian god gave me canines so i
[1:07:15] could tear some meat with
[1:07:18] but god told us he said okay you can eat
[1:07:21] meat now you can eat this you can eat
[1:07:23] these things
[1:07:23] what is it and but it's life but it's
[1:07:26] not precious life don't get me wrong
[1:07:28] every life precious but it's not
[1:07:29] precious life
[1:07:30] that is a part of god like me and you
[1:07:33] are a part of god
[1:07:34] we have a soul we have something that
[1:07:36] listen god is
[1:07:38] obligated to his word right
[1:07:42] so god is obligated when a man and a
[1:07:45] woman comes together he's obligated to
[1:07:47] give you a soul
[1:07:49] because of the law of reproduction now
[1:07:51] remember though
[1:07:53] the beginning of the creation of god
[1:07:54] should have been that's what brother
[1:07:56] dale's talking about
[1:07:57] should have been spoken word creation
[1:08:00] but because of what happened satan what
[1:08:02] he perverted
[1:08:04] the original way of god okay
[1:08:08] so let's get into that real quick right
[1:08:10] here let's go to genesis
[1:08:11] one oh let's read this right here first
[1:08:16] sorry
[1:08:18] i think i missed the page here we go i'm
[1:08:20] sorry let's read this first because i
[1:08:21] want to get these
[1:08:22] the different seeds and then we'll go to
[1:08:24] genesis one
[1:08:26] all right number three exposition seven
[1:08:28] churches and get a little ahead of
[1:08:29] myself for there were certain
[1:08:30] men not saints crypt and unawares these
[1:08:33] have not come before by the means of the
[1:08:35] door and are therefore robbers
[1:08:36] who were there before of old ordained to
[1:08:38] the condemnation ungodly men turning the
[1:08:40] grace of our god into lascivious and
[1:08:42] denied the only lord
[1:08:43] god in our lord jesus christ these are
[1:08:45] spots in your feast
[1:08:47] when they feast with you feeding
[1:08:50] themselves without fear it cannot be
[1:08:51] denied in the face of these scriptures
[1:08:53] that the true church
[1:08:54] and the false church are intertwined
[1:08:58] having been planted together but of
[1:09:00] different seeds
[1:09:02] right now that's a spiritual planting
[1:09:05] that's not a natural planting that's a
[1:09:06] spiritual planting all right
[1:09:08] so now let's go to exposition of the
[1:09:10] church age this is a new one here i
[1:09:12] found it the other day listen to this
[1:09:14] did you get it now there are those twins
[1:09:17] again remember there was a tree of life
[1:09:19] and a tree of knowledge in the garden
[1:09:21] right there are those two trees again
[1:09:24] growing side by side
[1:09:27] in the same earth partaking of the same
[1:09:31] nourishment
[1:09:32] drinking in the same water rain
[1:09:35] and benefiting by the same sun but they
[1:09:38] are
[1:09:39] but they come from different seeds one
[1:09:42] tree is for the word of god
[1:09:43] exactly as god give it and loves and
[1:09:45] obeys it the other tree is from the
[1:09:48] seed that is anti the word of god
[1:09:51] and changes it where it wants to it
[1:09:53] substitutes its own creeds and dogmas
[1:09:55] for the living true word
[1:09:57] exactly as cain did as did cain who
[1:10:00] ended up killing abel but fear not
[1:10:02] little flock
[1:10:03] stay with the word keep that word
[1:10:05] between you and the devil
[1:10:06] eve did not do that and she failed
[1:10:11] and when the church lets down on the
[1:10:12] word she goes into the depths
[1:10:14] of the darkness of satan
[1:10:18] wow that's pretty rough so now let's go
[1:10:21] to genesis 1.
[1:10:24] let's talk about the light just for a
[1:10:25] second in the beginning god created
[1:10:26] heaven and the earth
[1:10:28] the earth without forming void and
[1:10:29] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[1:10:31] the spirit of god moved
[1:10:32] upon the face of the waters and god said
[1:10:34] let there be light and there was light
[1:10:36] we talked about that wings tonight
[1:10:37] i hope you understand that that wasn't
[1:10:39] an artificial light either that
[1:10:41] light emanated from the almighty
[1:10:44] that light didn't have a beginning
[1:10:46] didn't have an end you can't do away
[1:10:48] with it just i said
[1:10:49] like i said before i read you that
[1:10:52] statement it says light is a form of
[1:10:54] energy
[1:10:56] when when when god said let there be
[1:10:58] light there had to something
[1:11:00] connect something had to rub together
[1:11:03] the big bang theory ever what you want
[1:11:05] to say it is
[1:11:07] but remember i'm like what brother dick
[1:11:08] always said he said i don't mind you
[1:11:10] talking about the big bang theory he
[1:11:11] said but somebody had to flip that
[1:11:13] switch
[1:11:15] to get the thing going right so it all
[1:11:18] to me it emanated from the eternal god
[1:11:20] because light is a form of energy
[1:11:22] energy can neither be created nor
[1:11:24] destroyed
[1:11:25] right so the energy of god is eternal
[1:11:30] it can only be changed from one form to
[1:11:33] another and that's what we're talking
[1:11:34] about where god
[1:11:35] that couldn't be understood that now
[1:11:37] he's now he's god because he's created
[1:11:39] angels to worship him he's created
[1:11:41] lucifer
[1:11:42] he's created all these things he's
[1:11:44] created
[1:11:45] uh gabriel all the different ones and
[1:11:47] then all he does is step
[1:11:49] over and says let there be not a
[1:11:52] different person he's changed his form
[1:11:54] he's took his energy
[1:11:57] and used it a little bit over here in
[1:11:59] this way amen
[1:12:01] same energy it emanates from the same
[1:12:03] place
[1:12:06] that all right but god saw the light
[1:12:08] what that it was good
[1:12:11] and god divided the light from the
[1:12:13] darkness and god called the light day in
[1:12:14] the darkness he called night
[1:12:16] and the evening in the morning with the
[1:12:17] first day now let's look at
[1:12:19] number four it is rising of the sun just
[1:12:22] read the
[1:12:23] red the first light that was ever given
[1:12:25] in the earth was god's spoken word
[1:12:27] the first light that ever struck the
[1:12:29] earth was god's spoken word
[1:12:31] he said let there be light and there was
[1:12:33] light that turned darkness into light in
[1:12:35] order to bring forth a creation
[1:12:37] of joy and life upon the earth
[1:12:41] remember that light wasn't created it
[1:12:44] was brought
[1:12:46] to the forefront it's what we were
[1:12:48] looking at here again what's the
[1:12:49] definition of light
[1:12:51] something that makes vision possible
[1:12:56] listen god always was
[1:12:59] and god always was a human now brother
[1:13:01] brown uses different things like forms
[1:13:02] of light and all
[1:13:04] god's always been a human he couldn't
[1:13:05] change from being that
[1:13:08] now he can change his form
[1:13:11] but he can't change who he is
[1:13:15] because if he stands there and says let
[1:13:16] us make man in our own image
[1:13:18] what image you well why it wasn't the
[1:13:21] image before
[1:13:22] there was darkness on the face of the
[1:13:23] earth and there was this and there was
[1:13:25] that and there was the other
[1:13:26] that brother brown says there's a halo
[1:13:27] of light listen
[1:13:30] we never came a halo of light
[1:13:33] adam never whirled around in the garden
[1:13:35] of eden no he was a man
[1:13:37] right right the first light was ever
[1:13:40] getting on earth was god spoken word
[1:13:41] what see spoken word seed the first
[1:13:45] light that ever struck the earth was
[1:13:46] god's spoken word and he said let there
[1:13:47] be light and there was light
[1:13:48] that turned darkness into light in order
[1:13:50] to bring forth the creation of joy and
[1:13:52] life
[1:13:53] upon the earth now like this other
[1:13:54] definition says the sensation aroused by
[1:13:57] stimulation of the visible
[1:13:59] visual receptors when the light comes on
[1:14:01] it stimulates something in your eyes
[1:14:03] remember your pupils dilate
[1:14:07] real hard lights your pupils go down to
[1:14:09] protect your eyes and but when you got
[1:14:10] perfect light man you just oh this is
[1:14:12] great you can see everything
[1:14:14] all these led lights that was put up and
[1:14:16] all the different things you can see
[1:14:17] much better why
[1:14:19] because you ought to be able to see
[1:14:20] god's word better spiritually
[1:14:22] your eyesight should be better than it
[1:14:25] was before
[1:14:26] amen so now let's read
[1:14:30] revelations and let's prove that that
[1:14:32] light wasn't the sun
[1:14:34] because in revelation 21 when this thing
[1:14:36] is all said and done and over with and i
[1:14:38] saw no temple there and for the lord god
[1:14:39] almighty and the lamb with the temple
[1:14:41] thereof
[1:14:42] and the city had no need of the sun
[1:14:44] neither of the moon to shine in it for
[1:14:46] the glory of god did lighten it and the
[1:14:48] lamb
[1:14:49] is the light thereof
[1:14:53] there's so much to god we don't
[1:14:54] understand but i understand one thing's
[1:14:56] for sure
[1:14:58] he is light
[1:15:01] and if he's light standing doing the
[1:15:03] creating brother bob then we were inside
[1:15:05] that light and when we come out and
[1:15:07] become
[1:15:08] little messiahs and we become little
[1:15:10] gods
[1:15:12] we're not darkness if you're born again
[1:15:16] today you got a light inside of you
[1:15:17] brother ramsay you go create a world
[1:15:19] [Applause]
[1:15:20] hello create a world and go live on it
[1:15:23] inside of you
[1:15:24] why because you're part of the creator
[1:15:26] you didn't make him less
[1:15:28] a creator when you came one day and
[1:15:30] received the baptism the holy ghost no
[1:15:32] you made him greater
[1:15:33] we can do the greater works know what
[1:15:38] god decided that
[1:15:41] because god could do it he could just
[1:15:42] say okay i'm gonna you know you don't
[1:15:44] need to preach i'm just gonna
[1:15:46] no that's not what he said his word
[1:15:50] just like i was thinking why brother
[1:15:52] dale was preaching you know brother
[1:15:53] branham said
[1:15:54] that the old testament saints built the
[1:15:56] body of god
[1:15:58] now they didn't like a lego set no
[1:16:01] what was it his body was not created by
[1:16:06] man and woman
[1:16:08] his body was created by the word yes
[1:16:11] that's right
[1:16:12] and he said a virgin shall conceive and
[1:16:14] bring forth a child
[1:16:16] not a man not a human i mean not a man
[1:16:18] like adam not a full-grown
[1:16:20] no baby he had to come the way the word
[1:16:24] said
[1:16:25] that's what built his body when jesus
[1:16:28] walked out he walked out on
[1:16:29] all that old testament word
[1:16:34] in the beginning was the word word was
[1:16:37] with god and the word was god
[1:16:39] and then it came down here and become
[1:16:41] flesh
[1:16:44] it's the law of reproduction so let's go
[1:16:47] to genesis
[1:16:48] one verse six and we're gonna go we're
[1:16:51] gonna
[1:16:52] go through this pretty quick and we'll
[1:16:53] be done i got another little thought i
[1:16:56] want to bring later on
[1:16:57] i got way a bunch of way a bunch of
[1:17:00] quotes back there
[1:17:01] god said let there be a firmament in the
[1:17:03] midst of the water and let it divide the
[1:17:04] waters from the waters
[1:17:06] now this was after that he had done made
[1:17:08] the created the light
[1:17:10] you understand that everybody with me
[1:17:13] all right and god said let the water
[1:17:15] under the heaven be gathered together
[1:17:16] into one place and let the dry land
[1:17:17] appeared it was so
[1:17:19] god called the dry land earth and
[1:17:21] gathered together the water called he
[1:17:22] sees and god saw that it was good now
[1:17:24] look this verse 11 is we're going to
[1:17:25] start right here
[1:17:26] [Music]
[1:17:29] this is the beginning of the law of
[1:17:31] reproduction
[1:17:33] all right so you put in the law of
[1:17:35] reproduction brother brown has several
[1:17:37] quotes on it
[1:17:38] but we'll not read them now to save time
[1:17:40] but now here is the law of reproduction
[1:17:42] and god said now who's standing there
[1:17:44] while god's saying this lucifer is
[1:17:47] standing right there
[1:17:49] he's not off playing somewhere he's in
[1:17:52] church
[1:17:55] so here he is standing next to the
[1:17:57] creator and god said let the earth bring
[1:17:59] forth grass
[1:18:01] the herb yielding seed satan said hmm
[1:18:04] something to begin with and the fruit
[1:18:07] tree yielding fruit what
[1:18:09] after his kind
[1:18:12] i didn't plant corn this year and expect
[1:18:15] potatoes to come up
[1:18:18] because i had corn seed when i planted
[1:18:20] corn seed i expect corn to come up
[1:18:22] god's the spoken seed word
[1:18:25] was perfect and original at the
[1:18:27] beginning when he said let them bring
[1:18:29] forth of their kind that's exactly what
[1:18:32] he meant
[1:18:34] now we've hybrided it
[1:18:37] man has but god don't hybrid
[1:18:42] god is original i've got many many
[1:18:45] quotes that brother brown tells us that
[1:18:46] god
[1:18:46] god's not in high breeding that's what
[1:18:48] got us in trouble to start with
[1:18:51] eve what high breeded with the beast
[1:18:55] didn't keep it original all right the
[1:18:57] herb yielding seed and the fruit tree
[1:18:59] yielding fruit
[1:19:00] after his kind whose seed
[1:19:04] is in itself so when god first spoke it
[1:19:09] he first spoke it when it started
[1:19:10] growing he didn't have to wait till that
[1:19:12] peach grew up
[1:19:13] and threw off a seed and it fell in the
[1:19:15] ground no
[1:19:17] he'd already set that in motion and you
[1:19:19] know guess what
[1:19:21] everybody millions of years ago that was
[1:19:25] it's still happening today i go look out
[1:19:28] in my yard and pour the little squirrels
[1:19:29] they
[1:19:30] they they probably like me and brother
[1:19:32] gary krantz they're absent-minded
[1:19:34] see i almost forgot your name so about
[1:19:37] absent as i could get
[1:19:39] but those squirrels go out there brother
[1:19:40] ray and right now there soon as the
[1:19:42] pecans fall out of the tree buddy they
[1:19:44] grab that pecan and go
[1:19:46] they push that thing down the ground now
[1:19:49] i'll eat you in a little while
[1:19:51] about january or february i they must
[1:19:53] have forgot about that drive-through
[1:19:55] restaurant right there
[1:19:56] because sister kathy what'll happen
[1:19:58] about april
[1:20:01] you'll see a shoot come up out of the
[1:20:02] ground
[1:20:04] i've got low pecan trees all over my
[1:20:06] yard why because it's the law of
[1:20:08] reproduction
[1:20:10] a pecan tree has to come from that seed
[1:20:12] if you put it in the right
[1:20:14] environment and surely
[1:20:17] they're wanting to eat it they're
[1:20:19] putting it up for food
[1:20:21] but if we have a good year and they
[1:20:22] plant so many i've got them growing
[1:20:24] mama all of us we've got we have to pull
[1:20:26] them up out of our out of our
[1:20:27] flower bed because here goes the little
[1:20:29] squirrel you know
[1:20:31] but what did he do he took that seed and
[1:20:33] put it in the right environment
[1:20:34] covered it up it went through the winter
[1:20:37] but when that life started hitting that
[1:20:39] seed it had to reproduce itself
[1:20:41] because it seemed life is in itself
[1:20:45] everybody got that same man whose seed
[1:20:47] is in itself
[1:20:48] after his kind and god saw that it was
[1:20:50] good so satan's going
[1:20:53] okay all right
[1:20:56] and god said let there be light in the
[1:20:58] firm of the heaven to divide the day
[1:20:59] from the night now he goes through and
[1:21:01] makes the two great lights so let's go
[1:21:03] skip some time go down to
[1:21:06] what's this right here verse 21
[1:21:09] god created great whales and every
[1:21:11] living creature that moveth
[1:21:13] which the waters brought forth
[1:21:14] abundantly after their kind
[1:21:17] and ever weaned foul after his kind and
[1:21:20] god saw that it was good
[1:21:22] and god blessed them satan's standing
[1:21:26] right there
[1:21:28] god blessed them and said what be
[1:21:31] fruitful
[1:21:32] and multiply and fill
[1:21:35] the waters and the seas and let fowl
[1:21:38] multiply
[1:21:39] in the earth now we know how they
[1:21:42] reproduce because you know what
[1:21:44] their seed is inside their self
[1:21:47] mama whale and daddy whale gets together
[1:21:48] mama dolphin and daddy dolphin gets
[1:21:50] together
[1:21:51] that the animals were procreating by
[1:21:56] sex everybody got that
[1:22:00] but now he said it in motion he got the
[1:22:03] chickens here
[1:22:04] remember the eggs didn't come first the
[1:22:06] chicken came first
[1:22:08] he created mama chicken and daddy
[1:22:09] chicken but when he created mama chicken
[1:22:11] and daddy chicken
[1:22:12] mom and cheese mama chicken and daddy
[1:22:14] chicken had to fulfill what god said
[1:22:17] be fruitful and multiply
[1:22:20] under life mama and daddy chicken gets
[1:22:24] together
[1:22:25] there's a seed planted and what comes
[1:22:27] forth an egg
[1:22:28] what's in that egg another chicken
[1:22:32] boy this is simple and the evening in
[1:22:35] the morning were the fifth day but you
[1:22:37] know who's watching it though
[1:22:41] lucifer's watching every bit of this
[1:22:43] he's going
[1:22:45] i can't create them to but i see how
[1:22:48] they are doing it
[1:22:49] and i'm standing there when god told
[1:22:51] them multiply
[1:22:53] and fill the earth in the evening and
[1:22:55] morning with the fifth day
[1:22:57] and god said let the earth bring forth
[1:22:59] the living creatures after his kind now
[1:23:01] what's god doing creative evolution he's
[1:23:02] coming up out of the water and he's
[1:23:04] building
[1:23:04] cattle he's got animals on top of the
[1:23:07] earth
[1:23:08] living creatures after his kind cattle
[1:23:10] and creeping things
[1:23:12] and you know what he created the beast
[1:23:20] daddy and mama beast
[1:23:23] and god made the beast of the earth
[1:23:25] after his kind
[1:23:30] remember let's don't have an aha moment
[1:23:34] the beast has called the serpent to hide
[1:23:38] what he was
[1:23:39] before god turned him into a serpent
[1:23:41] everybody got that
[1:23:42] he was a beast he was an upright
[1:23:44] creature he was walking on the earth
[1:23:46] he was between man and monkey in flesh
[1:23:51] and god made the beast of the earth
[1:23:53] after his kind and cattle after their
[1:23:55] kind and everything that creepeth upon
[1:23:57] the earth
[1:23:58] god created them and said go multiply
[1:24:01] all right sexually between a male and a
[1:24:04] female
[1:24:05] nothing wrong with that because he's
[1:24:06] what he told them to do
[1:24:08] to bring life but satan's going
[1:24:15] remember brother brown said satan knew
[1:24:17] the knowledge of the principles of life
[1:24:18] that's the principle the law of
[1:24:20] reproduction is what
[1:24:21] listen satan worked under what god said
[1:24:26] don't you think that's what he's doing
[1:24:28] now yeah so i said about religious not
[1:24:30] all these things he's working under the
[1:24:33] umbrella of the message
[1:24:36] because god made the beast of the earth
[1:24:38] after his kind and the cattle after
[1:24:39] their kind and everything that creepeth
[1:24:41] upon the earth
[1:24:42] he made them god saw that it was good
[1:24:44] and he told them to go and multiply
[1:24:47] the earth everybody got that say amen
[1:24:50] and that was between a mama and a daddy
[1:24:54] animal the the the man and the woman all
[1:24:57] right
[1:24:58] but now remember we'll get into this a
[1:25:00] little bit later
[1:25:01] that is what animal flesh
[1:25:07] now when we come to this right here
[1:25:12] it wasn't in animal flesh yet right
[1:25:16] everybody got that saying man you've
[1:25:18] been through genesis 1 26 in this church
[1:25:20] long enough you ought to know what that
[1:25:21] is
[1:25:24] that's god that's you in a multiple form
[1:25:27] that's adam that's the eternal life
[1:25:32] right there so you can't create an
[1:25:34] eternal life what i tell you many many
[1:25:36] times before
[1:25:37] when we get down to where it says god
[1:25:38] created man in his image
[1:25:40] that word is formed god is forming
[1:25:44] his own family when he said let us make
[1:25:47] man in our image you know what i believe
[1:25:49] i believe brother luis that's when he
[1:25:50] started making that picture
[1:25:53] he didn't need a polaroid no it was
[1:25:56] already in him it was a part of him
[1:25:58] see the look at the difference between
[1:26:00] me and you and god
[1:26:01] god knew how many children he was going
[1:26:03] to have because he's only got so many
[1:26:06] seed
[1:26:06] he knew what they were going to look
[1:26:08] like because he was god
[1:26:10] by foreknowledge but see you and i don't
[1:26:14] we just leave it to god but we know one
[1:26:17] thing's for sure
[1:26:19] sterling doesn't look like
[1:26:23] brother dardy why not the right seed
[1:26:28] amen but if you come to the right seat
[1:26:30] you're going to produce exactly where
[1:26:31] you came from
[1:26:32] amen that was the same way with cain and
[1:26:35] abel they produced exactly where they
[1:26:37] came from
[1:26:38] all right but let's not get to that real
[1:26:40] quick so now look
[1:26:43] and god blessed them verse 26 and god
[1:26:45] said let us make man in our image
[1:26:49] and after our likeness and let them have
[1:26:52] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[1:26:53] over the fowl of the air and over the
[1:26:54] cattle and over all the earth and over
[1:26:56] every creeping thing that creepeth upon
[1:26:57] the earth
[1:26:58] so god created man in his own image or
[1:27:01] formed
[1:27:02] man in his own image because remember as
[1:27:04] brother dale's talking about the
[1:27:06] beginning of the creation of god
[1:27:08] listen god has no beginning
[1:27:12] and god was not created
[1:27:15] so you got to take those words and know
[1:27:17] what god's saying
[1:27:19] i know what he's doing he's hiding it
[1:27:21] he's hiding it from even the devil
[1:27:24] he's hiding in your heart so that you
[1:27:27] get a revelation of what god said
[1:27:31] so god created a man in his own image
[1:27:33] the image of god created to him male and
[1:27:35] female created to them
[1:27:36] what happened was you got god's standing
[1:27:39] there
[1:27:39] you got lucifer standing here he's
[1:27:42] already fought michael so
[1:27:44] he don't have enough revelation to know
[1:27:46] that michael's standing right here
[1:27:49] he fought michael and he's the guy
[1:27:51] standing right here you know
[1:27:52] and then here's this other i'm going to
[1:27:54] say this this other thing
[1:27:57] comes out of god god start god's going
[1:28:01] i'm going to make something created in
[1:28:03] my image and
[1:28:04] i'm going to put it down here on the and
[1:28:07] satan's going
[1:28:08] lucifer's going where are you going to
[1:28:10] get it from
[1:28:13] you ever thought about that satan's
[1:28:14] going where are you because he can't
[1:28:16] create he has no thought of creation
[1:28:19] but there's the creator god's got it
[1:28:21] every bit in his mind he's got it every
[1:28:23] bit a part of him
[1:28:24] he knows what adam's gonna look like he
[1:28:27] knows where he's gonna put him
[1:28:30] satan only knows
[1:28:34] that when adam was put in human flesh
[1:28:36] brother branham said i'll bring the
[1:28:38] quotes later because we'll stop here
[1:28:39] pretty quick
[1:28:41] he said knowing the principles of life
[1:28:43] he knew that if he put adam and eve in
[1:28:46] flesh they'd fall
[1:28:48] so satan is standing there going
[1:28:51] their body looks just like this i can't
[1:28:55] i know that the monkey can't mingle i
[1:28:57] know that the bird can't mingle
[1:28:59] but there's a guy there talking to right
[1:29:00] over here that's probably
[1:29:03] uh if i was gonna be adam i'd need
[1:29:06] somebody to help around the house so i'd
[1:29:08] get the beast because he could talk
[1:29:11] monkeys you have to train but the bees
[1:29:13] could talk
[1:29:15] so i guess mr miss beast probably lived
[1:29:17] the closest i'm just saying you don't
[1:29:19] have to agree with him if you want to
[1:29:20] but i'ma tell you something eve was real
[1:29:22] comfortable with that thing
[1:29:24] around her yeah
[1:29:27] he didn't go running to adam and say oh
[1:29:29] that beast is talking to me
[1:29:31] no he's comfortable she's doing her
[1:29:34] little work and he's doing his little
[1:29:36] work and the beast is out there you know
[1:29:37] maybe sweeping the porch or
[1:29:39] planting the garden you understand what
[1:29:41] i'm saying
[1:29:42] because satan knew he said
[1:29:46] i think that right there's what i'm
[1:29:47] going to use because she's comfortable
[1:29:50] with him
[1:29:52] and all i'm going to do is i'm going to
[1:29:54] just step in there and motivate him
[1:29:57] and help this thing along just a little
[1:29:59] bit
[1:30:00] because you know what god said right
[1:30:02] here look and god blessed them
[1:30:04] and said unto them be fruitful be
[1:30:06] fruitful and multiply
[1:30:08] and replenish the earth and subdue it
[1:30:11] now brother brown said we'll not subdue
[1:30:13] it until the millennium i'll bring all
[1:30:14] those quotes next sunday
[1:30:15] and have dominion over the fish of the
[1:30:18] sea and over the fowl of the air and
[1:30:20] over
[1:30:20] every living thing that creepeth or
[1:30:22] moveth upon the earth
[1:30:23] so satan is standing there and god's
[1:30:25] given whatever this
[1:30:27] being is authority
[1:30:31] over the whole earth now satan said wait
[1:30:34] a minute
[1:30:35] i'm down here now i'm your right-hand
[1:30:38] guy you see that attitude
[1:30:42] i'm your right-hand guy but you know
[1:30:44] satan's over there too he's sitting over
[1:30:46] in the corner and he's going
[1:30:48] i'll get him i'll get him
[1:30:51] when he puts that in human flesh i'll
[1:30:54] get him
[1:30:55] he said cause i can motivate that flesh
[1:30:57] he can't sit and can't get to your soul
[1:30:59] folks if you're born again
[1:31:01] cannot get your soul but he sure can
[1:31:03] play in that spirit realm
[1:31:04] which goes out into your body
[1:31:07] amen that's his playground
[1:31:11] and he knew it as soon as adam and eve
[1:31:13] were put in the flesh in genesis 2 7.
[1:31:16] that's right but god had a purpose for
[1:31:18] putting them in human flesh
[1:31:20] because he wanted to live in human flesh
[1:31:23] and he wanted to prove to satan that we
[1:31:25] could live down here in human flesh
[1:31:27] and not be a child of satan sure we were
[1:31:29] all born between satan and eve we were
[1:31:30] all
[1:31:31] we'll get to that next next week because
[1:31:34] here we are spoken word
[1:31:38] seed he spoke
[1:31:42] this right here and it come to pass
[1:31:46] he takes that and he puts it inside of a
[1:31:49] man named adam
[1:31:50] in a spirit man not a ghost floating
[1:31:52] around i believe when he made adam
[1:31:54] adam was a ruler of the earth now i
[1:31:56] don't believe adam had any limitation i
[1:31:58] believe adam could just move wherever he
[1:31:59] wanted to
[1:32:00] on the earth brother brown said just
[1:32:03] like the holy spirit leaves today so the
[1:32:05] holy spirit's not in one place
[1:32:07] he's everywhere it's all over the world
[1:32:10] so adam had that ability
[1:32:12] to be the god of the earth go around on
[1:32:15] the other side of the earth and move a
[1:32:16] tree somewhere
[1:32:18] that's what he said he said eve he would
[1:32:20] say oh adam
[1:32:22] adam i need this moved he said oh stop
[1:32:25] move whatever
[1:32:27] but remember that was later on because
[1:32:28] remember when that man was created and
[1:32:30] put
[1:32:31] down here we'll read it later on next
[1:32:33] sunday
[1:32:34] we'll stop right here musicians get
[1:32:36] ready to come
[1:32:38] we look at the spoken word seed
[1:32:41] well i tell you what we're gonna have
[1:32:42] musicians because we're gonna have a
[1:32:43] communion we'll just sing a song
[1:32:45] a cappella and then we'll um
[1:32:49] do the communion service but listen just
[1:32:52] for a few minutes
[1:32:54] god's original seed
[1:32:57] was right here look at me for a minute
[1:33:00] god see
[1:33:00] original seed was right here it was
[1:33:03] spoken
[1:33:05] law of reproduction was put into into
[1:33:08] into
[1:33:08] motion for man listen
[1:33:12] and for spirit man
[1:33:18] come on we gotta get you right
[1:33:21] this is it right here
[1:33:24] it's a spirit man he's not putting him
[1:33:26] in flash yet
[1:33:28] he's telling them to multiply and they
[1:33:31] don't even have a body
[1:33:33] like this body
[1:33:36] they got a body theophany
[1:33:41] but remember theophany don't sexually
[1:33:44] reproduce
[1:33:45] never has never will
[1:33:50] why remember it wasn't so
[1:33:53] in the beginning jesus said in the
[1:33:56] beginning we were not supposed to
[1:33:58] procreate
[1:33:58] sexually you say well why are we
[1:34:00] pro-creating sexually because we were
[1:34:02] put in human flesh
[1:34:03] i mean we were put in animal flesh and
[1:34:06] then when the fall happened
[1:34:08] it happened that's what happened
[1:34:11] satan perverted instead of now being a
[1:34:13] spoken word seed
[1:34:16] that had to be completely cut off yeah
[1:34:19] that's right
[1:34:21] god could not bring his children
[1:34:24] from a dirty womb now remember the first
[1:34:27] womb was right here
[1:34:29] this is one we talk about now the
[1:34:31] spiritual womb right here
[1:34:32] eve had to get it right here before she
[1:34:35] did the act the act was just a
[1:34:37] culmination
[1:34:38] of saying okay let's do it right you
[1:34:40] understand what i'm saying
[1:34:42] all right so then satan injected himself
[1:34:45] into the human race
[1:34:46] and god said okay we can't do this right
[1:34:48] now
[1:34:49] but i've already spoken listen god's
[1:34:52] word is eternal
[1:34:53] i've already spoken it will happen
[1:34:56] i got my children i already know who
[1:34:58] they are they're woven
[1:35:00] up inside my body
[1:35:03] the dna of god
[1:35:06] satan you can bring them in a perverted
[1:35:08] way that's all right i'll permit that
[1:35:10] because
[1:35:10] the animals are doing the same thing
[1:35:13] i'll permit that
[1:35:14] but they're going to be under a law now
[1:35:17] not just the law of reproduction because
[1:35:19] a woman
[1:35:20] is under the headship of the man the
[1:35:22] woman will bring
[1:35:24] children in childbirth and sorrow all
[1:35:27] these different things she'll be what
[1:35:28] subject to the man
[1:35:29] because remember before the fall folks
[1:35:32] it wasn't
[1:35:33] adam and eve right hello
[1:35:38] they were co-equal they were the same
[1:35:43] except that the emotional part of eve is
[1:35:46] what got her in trouble
[1:35:51] the central part that adam didn't have
[1:35:56] because when god separated him there
[1:35:57] stood satan
[1:35:59] when he separated him and said hmm i
[1:36:01] know what that is
[1:36:03] i can get to that i can get to her
[1:36:06] feelings
[1:36:08] i'm telling you this is why brother
[1:36:09] brown that's why women don't preach
[1:36:11] that's why all these different things
[1:36:12] that goes on in and now that we
[1:36:14] that women have to be put under but
[1:36:16] listen when we get over there on the
[1:36:17] other side
[1:36:19] when we get a body change
[1:36:22] i look what happened look what happened
[1:36:25] over there in the sixth dimension when
[1:36:26] brother brown went across the dimension
[1:36:28] he said that women were hugging me they
[1:36:30] didn't come up and shake his hand
[1:36:32] they were hugging him my precious
[1:36:34] brother even his wife first wife you
[1:36:36] know my prayer
[1:36:37] girlfriend my precious brother and my
[1:36:39] precious brother why
[1:36:40] all that junk has done away with yes we
[1:36:43] go back to the original
[1:36:45] where adam and eve now listen adam and
[1:36:47] eve stick your finger out adam and eve
[1:36:48] didn't walk around like this
[1:36:50] forever how many years before the fall
[1:36:53] they were husband and wife
[1:36:55] but they did not produce sexually
[1:36:57] children
[1:36:58] before the fall there was a holy ghost
[1:37:00] veil it didn't matter if they walked
[1:37:01] around with her arm around her
[1:37:03] his arm around her and her arm around
[1:37:05] him she could sit on his lap
[1:37:08] nothing right that's what we're going
[1:37:10] back to folks
[1:37:11] that's why brother brown said it ain't
[1:37:12] none of that over there jesus said it
[1:37:14] wasn't so from the beginning you know
[1:37:16] them pharisees bless their heart
[1:37:17] well if this one marries seven times and
[1:37:19] has dies and has ever seven brothers and
[1:37:22] they come in and they
[1:37:24] he said will that be in there jesus said
[1:37:27] carnal carnal carnal
[1:37:31] right right that will not happen in the
[1:37:34] resurrection
[1:37:36] but it's a beautiful thing if we do it
[1:37:38] right right
[1:37:40] because it's honored of god
[1:37:44] on this side right but it wasn't so from
[1:37:47] the beginning
[1:37:49] it was to be spoken word right
[1:37:52] why did it why did why was spoken word
[1:37:55] listen
[1:37:57] one more thing for close listen to this
[1:38:01] aren't you and i the body of christ
[1:38:05] aren't you now the only body that jesus
[1:38:07] christ will have on this earth
[1:38:08] until he comes back and we are his what
[1:38:14] bride
[1:38:17] what does the bride produce
[1:38:21] the egg which is the body
[1:38:25] that's right but it takes life from the
[1:38:28] mail
[1:38:30] that's why he's got a bride on the earth
[1:38:32] folks because brother brown said she'll
[1:38:34] be impregnated
[1:38:35] with the seed word of god
[1:38:39] spoken every sunday every wednesday
[1:38:42] every time you mash play
[1:38:44] every time you get together and talk
[1:38:45] about the word of god
[1:38:47] that is a seed going forth that is a
[1:38:50] seed that will come forth
[1:38:52] and bring exactly what it said it would
[1:38:54] bring forth
[1:38:56] when jesus swing well when jesus said
[1:38:58] multiply and replenish the earth
[1:39:00] sure he had to wait a couple thousand
[1:39:02] years
[1:39:04] but he came anyway it just it didn't do
[1:39:08] anything but just it let the old
[1:39:10] testament come into view
[1:39:11] for 4 000 years it let that old
[1:39:13] testament come in profits come in
[1:39:15] and what built the egg
[1:39:20] they built the egg what brother brown
[1:39:24] said brother brown didn't say that
[1:39:26] that the old testament prophets produced
[1:39:27] the life
[1:39:29] they produced the body that's what you
[1:39:32] and i are to what to be the body of
[1:39:34] christ we're producing the body of
[1:39:35] christ
[1:39:36] because without his life without his
[1:39:39] spoken
[1:39:40] seed word you and i are d-e-a-d
[1:39:44] we are dead oh no i'm alive i can run a
[1:39:47] 20-mile marathon
[1:39:49] you're going to die sometime
[1:39:53] and your soul is going to have to go
[1:39:54] before god
[1:39:56] but if you're born again tonight your
[1:39:57] soul is god
[1:39:59] your soul is god it's god it always was
[1:40:02] god
[1:40:04] in his mind it always was right you and
[1:40:07] i had to come down here what underneath
[1:40:09] the water or underneath the fall
[1:40:12] but you got here anyway yes listen the
[1:40:15] very image that brother ray gabriel was
[1:40:17] supposed to be had there not been a fall
[1:40:18] is sitting here today
[1:40:20] inside of a man that his mom and daddy
[1:40:21] had to bring into being right
[1:40:28] so what are we what we worried about
[1:40:31] if you're born again today what are you
[1:40:33] worried about oh i
[1:40:35] i
[1:40:38] blame the devil he's the one that's
[1:40:41] making you old god never wanted you to
[1:40:42] be old
[1:40:44] he always wanted you to be young let's
[1:40:47] stand to our feet
[1:40:49] he is here hallelujah
[1:40:54] he is here
[1:40:58] amen he
[1:41:01] is here holy
[1:41:05] holy i will bless
[1:41:09] his name again
[1:41:12] amen he is here did he call your name
[1:41:15] today
[1:41:16] closely hear him calling out
[1:41:22] your name he is here
[1:41:27] you can touch him you will never
[1:41:33] be it doesn't matter if you come from a
[1:41:36] prostitute and a
[1:41:37] and a drunk if you got to see the god in
[1:41:41] you it's exactly what it was before the
[1:41:42] foundation the world hasn't changed
[1:41:44] one bit you've been changed into his
[1:41:48] image
[1:41:49] we'll read the scripture next sunday
[1:41:51] where we there was an earthy
[1:41:53] and there was a heavenly there's a
[1:41:55] terrestrial and there's a celestial
[1:41:57] but that's where the two see because
[1:41:59] remember
[1:42:01] if you're a seed of god satan can't
[1:42:02] touch that
[1:42:05] but if you're over here on the other
[1:42:06] side and you and and you become just a
[1:42:08] natural birth and you don't have the
[1:42:09] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:42:11] you're that unholy spirit you're that
[1:42:12] unholy seed and god can't
[1:42:14] protect you amen
[1:42:17] but remember it's not that they're
[1:42:19] separate i keep walking over here and
[1:42:20] over here they're right here
[1:42:23] you're rubbing elbows because it's a
[1:42:26] religious spirit
[1:42:27] right so remember that but everything
[1:42:30] originated from god
[1:42:31] satan just perverted what he needed to
[1:42:34] pervert
[1:42:35] but you know what by foreign knowledge
[1:42:37] god knew what he would pervert
[1:42:39] knew how he would pervert it knew how
[1:42:42] this all thing would come out and it
[1:42:43] would all work to his honor and glory we
[1:42:45] we can realize that we come from god and
[1:42:48] we're going back to god
[1:42:49] amen we were in that dna strain of the
[1:42:51] eternal of the creator
[1:42:53] i was telling louise today listen just
[1:42:55] go sit somewhere and close your eyes and
[1:42:58] forget the whole
[1:42:59] all this junk and just say god
[1:43:04] place me in your mind i know that's
[1:43:07] where i came from
[1:43:09] but to have the mind of christ means
[1:43:11] that he'll be able to show you these
[1:43:13] things
[1:43:14] he'll be able to show you even though
[1:43:15] there's not a verbatim scripture
[1:43:18] because the serpent was more was more
[1:43:20] substantive than any beast of the field
[1:43:22] didn't say the beast was
[1:43:24] but when moses was writing it god had
[1:43:27] him penned that
[1:43:28] to hide it from the wise and prudent

[1:46:38] we'll just get it set back up in here
[1:46:39] and
[1:46:40] we can move about and do things here
[1:46:42] different and do everything okay
[1:46:44] so let's just read our scripture in
[1:46:47] first corinthians
[1:46:49] forever received of the lord that which
[1:46:51] also i delivered unto you that the lord
[1:46:54] jesus the same night in which he was
[1:46:56] was betrayed took bread
[1:46:59] and when he had given thanks he break it
[1:47:01] and said take heat this is my body
[1:47:04] which is broken for you this due in
[1:47:06] remembrance of me
[1:47:07] and after the same manner also he took
[1:47:10] the cup
[1:47:11] when he had stopped saying this cup is
[1:47:14] the new testament
[1:47:15] in my blood this new years offers you
[1:47:17] drink it in remembrance of me
[1:47:19] for as often as you eat this bread and
[1:47:21] drink this cup you do you the lord's
[1:47:23] death till he come
[1:47:25] wherefore whosoever ever shall eat this
[1:47:28] bread and drink this
[1:47:29] cup of the lord unworthily shall be
[1:47:32] guilty of the body and blood
[1:47:34] of the lord but let a man
[1:47:37] examine himself and so let him eat of
[1:47:40] that bread
[1:47:41] and drink of that cup for he that eateth
[1:47:43] and drinketh unworthy then drinketh
[1:47:46] damnation to himself not discerning the
[1:47:48] lord's body
[1:47:49] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:47:52] among
[1:47:52] you and many sleep for we would judge
[1:47:55] ourselves we should not be judged
[1:47:57] but when we are judged we are chastened
[1:48:00] to the lord
[1:48:01] that we should not be condemned with the
[1:48:03] world wherefore my brethren when you
[1:48:05] come together to eat terry one for
[1:48:07] another
[1:48:08] and if any man hunger let him eat at
[1:48:10] home
[1:48:12] that you come not together under
[1:48:14] condemnation the restless set in order
[1:48:17] when i come let's just take a few
[1:48:19] moments of solid prayer praying one for
[1:48:21] another
[1:48:22] and mainly praying for the sick ones
[1:48:24] among us
[1:48:25] that the lord would come among us and
[1:48:27] take away these sicknesses and things
[1:48:30] you know let's pray silently before the
[1:48:44] lord
[1:48:51] others just be with each one reach down
[1:48:53] and touch us all
[1:48:54] these old afflictions of the flesh come
[1:48:57] upon us sometimes lord because of the
[1:49:00] fallen
[1:49:00] condition but it also manifests your
[1:49:03] loving grace unto us
[1:49:04] as a healer and a deliverer so just have
[1:49:07] your way
[1:49:08] forgive our sins and lead us by that
[1:49:10] understanding lord and as we
[1:49:12] partake of this communion may we
[1:49:14] remember what it means to us
[1:49:16] and what what made it come to pass is
[1:49:19] what we need to remember
[1:49:20] we love you and we thank you be with the
[1:49:22] sick ones among us touch each one
[1:49:24] and deliver in jesus name amen
[1:49:33] father we thank you for this bread it's
[1:49:35] been made for this purpose today
[1:49:37] and for this purpose we come to this
[1:49:39] place to be able to try to remember
[1:49:42] lord more about you yes just have your
[1:49:44] way with us
[1:49:45] lord let your loving grace be with us

[1:49:49] and the partakers in jesus name

[1:50:20] taking communion because he said the
[1:50:22] lord has come

[1:50:28] where we're at what's going on if if the
[1:50:30] lord's come we're in bad shape

[1:50:36] people saying oh we're already in the
[1:50:37] millennium

[1:51:26] when i get down there
[1:51:31] brother we're told in that word that we
[1:51:34] are to take this
[1:51:36] what we call communion we really know
[1:51:39] that
[1:51:40] it's just a sign or a symbol
[1:51:43] of what took place long time ago but you
[1:51:46] died on the cross for
[1:51:48] us and you gave your blood that we could
[1:51:50] all live
[1:51:51] father we thank you that we've been told
[1:51:54] these things and the truth of it
[1:51:56] where we don't get it confused with the
[1:51:58] world and all of their doings
[1:52:00] we just ask you to sanctify this wine
[1:52:02] today because a symbol of your blood
[1:52:05] that was for each one of us and
[1:52:07] just reach down into us lord we've seen
[1:52:09] it before
[1:52:11] that you just touched the sick among us
[1:52:13] by taking the communion because that's
[1:52:15] what we're doing we're fulfilling thy
[1:52:17] word
[1:52:18] doing what we can do the best we can do
