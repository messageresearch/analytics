[13:46] only live people there is sometimes we
[13:49] feel sometimes we feel dead but we're
[13:52] not and I love that song that that
[13:55] Louise sang there I like that that
[13:57] worship song I I told him this morning I
[14:00] down at Sunday school class that uh
[14:02] Louise sent us that
[14:04] song uh to practice and and and June
[14:08] helped singing and US helped sing and
[14:10] all that you know Cu uh so June this
[14:12] morning we were all I was humming enter
[14:14] in Into the Heart of Worship and June
[14:16] was singing I enter into the Heart of
[14:18] Worship and everything was good she
[14:21] walked out of the bedroom and we've got
[14:23] two rabbits and they were fighting each
[14:25] other and she was we enter into the
[14:28] heart of worship y'all stop what you
[14:30] doing now stop it we enter into the stop
[14:34] now I mean stop it I said that is a true
[14:38] mama your mama can beat you and sing
[14:41] worship songs at the same
[14:46] time sister Anna come on back there
[14:48] worshiping God and she got that spoon
[14:50] about
[14:56] that oh we're just humans I told them
[14:58] this morning I I said you know as we
[15:01] progress up the statue of a perfect man
[15:02] I think we what we want what we want is
[15:05] everybody to change to the way we want
[15:06] them to change I'm not going to ever get
[15:09] silent
[15:11] sorry it's just not in me it's not part
[15:13] of
[15:14] me God likes me this way whether you do
[15:17] or Not So today we're going to uh
[15:20] continue our thought on on uh the son of
[15:23] man and today we're going to uh try to
[15:26] just go through scripture we're not
[15:27] going to read any quotes we're just
[15:29] going to go through scripture
[15:31] and and um maybe show a little that's
[15:34] why I was saying that the reason I said
[15:35] what I said is that we thought we think
[15:38] that when the son of man came on Earth
[15:40] which is God Almighty in human flesh
[15:42] that he walked that he walked so much
[15:44] like God well he did but it was so
[15:48] different that the the people the people
[15:51] around him he was so
[15:53] normal till remember they didn't
[15:56] even uh in his own found he couldn't do
[15:59] Mighty Works cuz they thought oh that's
[16:01] Joseph's son or that oh he's just that's
[16:03] just Jesus you see what I'm saying so I
[16:06] don't think we're going towards
[16:11] superhuman we're human we proved that
[16:14] last
[16:16] night and y'all need to pray for Gabby
[16:18] and Ryan and I mean I know they got four
[16:21] children but they sure need to talk to
[16:23] each
[16:24] other cuz they uh they didn't get much
[16:27] done last night as far as answering
[16:29] questions about their uh about their s
[16:32] so just be but now Louis and Christine
[16:34] they won last night they won uh they won
[16:37] the gift certificate cuz they they got
[16:39] the most points and we just try to have
[16:41] a good good fun you really do find out
[16:43] who knows who knows about what about
[16:45] your spouse so uh we thank the Lord for
[16:48] for brother Dell and sister Dell for for
[16:50] paying for the thing and letting us
[16:52] come and
[16:55] uh and all the great things that that
[16:58] were that went on and surely I told uh U
[17:02] we went to Loretta's well her name is
[17:04] Loretta and that's how that she's the
[17:05] owner and I said you know I said do you
[17:08] just like being around us I said you're
[17:10] an owner and you're here at 9:00 at
[17:12] night usually you don't see
[17:14] owners there at 9:00 at night she said I
[17:17] just love to be around y'all she said I
[17:19] just love to be around y so that ought
[17:22] to show something that ought to tell you
[17:23] something even though we do act silly
[17:25] and laugh like crazy we do
[17:27] present maybe the Lord to to the world
[17:30] that they really don't get to see cuz a
[17:33] lot of it's fake ours is not but a lot
[17:36] of the world is f they they hate to see
[17:42] fake no they
[17:48] don't sure
[17:51] sure sure well hey they see something
[17:55] different even though like I said if you
[17:56] were to walk in cuz they were say we
[17:58] played the Left Right game out in the
[18:01] parking
[18:03] lot it's just so happened where we were
[18:05] there wasn't a lot of cars so we played
[18:07] the Left Right game and sister Kathy you
[18:09] were alive and well there and you
[18:12] weren't even
[18:14] there you'd start doing the Left Right
[18:17] game and you'd look around and
[18:18] somebody'd be holding four bags you're
[18:21] supposed to only have one and no and
[18:24] three people be going I don't have one
[18:27] so sister Kathy you were there in spirit
[18:29] and in
[18:30] truth so but good to be in the house of
[18:33] the Lord but yeah people around us
[18:34] probably thought we were crazy but you
[18:36] know what Paul said in the way it's
[18:38] called heresy I worship the God and
[18:41] father of our Lord Jesus Christ so let's
[18:43] turn to John 14 and we're going
[18:47] to try to
[18:50] uh you know Jesus he he comes up to a
[18:53] place and I believe this is the whole
[18:56] point of him being on Earth was to show
[18:58] the father
[18:59] amen cuz they didn't understand who the
[19:01] father was so he was here to show who
[19:03] the father is and how he worked on Earth
[19:07] and sometimes it may be a little
[19:09] different we're going to read some
[19:10] things like I said this morning in
[19:11] Sunday school we're going to read some
[19:13] things that seems of opposite but I'm
[19:14] going to let Jesus talk to you okay if
[19:17] you don't believe me believe Jesus he's
[19:18] the one that said it okay all right so
[19:20] let's bow our heads before we before we
[19:22] get started dear Lord we thank you today
[19:25] for this time that we've come Lord that
[19:28] we set aside every week Lord to speak
[19:30] about you father and we pray that you
[19:32] would be the active participant be the
[19:34] speaker Lord be the hearer be the Seer
[19:37] be Lord be the one that that does all
[19:39] the work in this congregation today
[19:41] father that you'll be with the ones that
[19:43] are sick Lord the ones that are sin sick
[19:46] ones that need a touch from you father
[19:49] we pray that you would come now to and
[19:51] minister to each one Lord just be with
[19:53] the ones that are not here that are sick
[19:55] ones that are traveling just bless them
[19:57] and take care of them we thank you Lord
[19:59] for the time we had last night and the
[20:00] fellowship and friendship that we have
[20:02] together we pray Lord that we'll be
[20:05] together now one with you as we sat down
[20:07] and hear what you had to say while you
[20:10] were here on Earth father forgive us of
[20:12] our sins be with us be with the foreign
[20:14] missionaries on the field bless them
[20:16] Lord and take care of them in Jesus name
[20:18] amen St John 141 let not your heart be
[20:22] troubled you believe in God believe also
[20:24] in me in my father's house or many
[20:27] mansions if I if it were not so I would
[20:29] have told you I go to prepare a place
[20:33] for you and if I go and prepare a place
[20:35] for you I will come again and receive
[20:37] you unto myself that where I am there
[20:39] you may be also and whether I go you
[20:42] know and the way you know so he's not
[20:45] going to leave us where we don't know
[20:46] anything Thomas said unto him Lord we
[20:49] know not whether thou goest and how can
[20:52] we know the way Jesus said unto him I am
[20:55] the way the truth and the life no man
[20:57] cometh unto the father
[20:59] but by me so to get to the father we
[21:01] know we have to go by the son of man if
[21:05] you had known me you should have known
[21:06] my father also and from henceforth you
[21:09] know him and have seen him now philli
[21:11] says wait a minute Lord we just see you
[21:15] in other words Lord show us the father
[21:18] and it will satisfy us in other words
[21:20] they had a question among theel it will
[21:22] satisfy Jesus said un him have I been so
[21:25] long time have I been this 50 years with
[21:28] you since the prophet
[21:30] left all right and yet hast thou not
[21:34] known me Phillip he that hath seen me
[21:37] hath seen the father and how sayest thou
[21:40] then showest the father believest thou
[21:44] not that I am in the father and the
[21:46] father in me he's asking a question
[21:48] there's a question mark you see
[21:49] it right the words that I speak unto you
[21:53] I speak not of myself but the father
[21:55] that dwelleth in me he doeth the work
[21:58] believe me that I am in the father and
[22:01] the father in me or else believe me for
[22:04] the very Works sake you may be seated
[22:07] and the Lord add his Blessing to the
[22:09] reading of the word so we see he says
[22:12] believe me even just believe me for the
[22:13] work's sake but now we're also going to
[22:16] watch in the life of Jesus that we're
[22:20] going to see some of them looked at his
[22:21] works and called him B up some of them
[22:24] looked at his works and called him
[22:26] everything but God right amen amen so I
[22:29] want you to I want us to go now to John
[22:36] 149 John
[22:40] 1419 he says yet a little while and the
[22:43] world seeth me no more but ye see me
[22:47] because I live you shall live also at
[22:50] that
[22:51] day which a prophet of God we know it's
[22:53] this
[22:54] day and I believe if Martin Luther was
[22:57] reading it he'd say at this day cuz that
[23:00] was his day when he was here right at
[23:02] that day you shall know that I am in the
[23:05] father and ye in me and I in you now
[23:08] that's a sermon in itself but what we're
[23:09] going to do is we're going to stay with
[23:11] the New Testament stay with what Jesus
[23:13] said he that hath my Commandments and
[23:15] keepeth them he is he that loveth me and
[23:17] he that loveth me shall be loved of my
[23:19] father and I will love him and will
[23:21] manifest myself to him so the only
[23:24] people that God's going to really
[23:26] manifest himself to is the people that
[23:30] know him now as as we see before in
[23:34] Scripture that Jesus said one time he
[23:35] said depart from me I never knew you in
[23:38] other words I never had a personal
[23:39] relationship that's the same thing you
[23:41] must know who he is right know where
[23:44] he's at you sure he's inside of me okay
[23:46] all right that's fine but
[23:49] remember when you look back in the Old
[23:52] Testament because we must set this scene
[23:55] everyone that Jesus was around when when
[23:58] he was
[24:00] here lived by the Old Testament you were
[24:04] either a Publican a sinner or you were
[24:06] what a Pharisee sadducee herodian
[24:08] somebody that knew that Old Testament up
[24:12] one side and down the other in other
[24:13] words they had read all their life the
[24:15] Old Testament so they should have known
[24:18] what was the problem with the people why
[24:20] didn't they know who Jesus was cuz he
[24:22] came exactly there's no way he could be
[24:24] the word made flesh and break the word
[24:27] amen there's no way he could be the word
[24:30] made flesh and break the word he had to
[24:32] be the word made manifest um Hebrews
[24:36] 10:5 a body thou Hast prepared me what
[24:39] from the Old Testament certain on saw
[24:42] him in a certain way certain ones saw
[24:44] him in another way but they all saw him
[24:46] the exact way he
[24:47] came but now wait a minute the religious
[24:51] world and most of the people that were
[24:53] around him did not understand who he
[24:57] was called him everything but what he
[25:01] was now I'm telling you this because
[25:03] that's what's going to happen to me and
[25:05] you you and I are if the son of man
[25:08] Ministry is here and I'm saying that if
[25:11] a question to you not to me but if you
[25:13] believe the son of man Ministries here
[25:15] like I said you got the same Devils to
[25:17] deal with you've got the same spirit of
[25:19] God to deal with amen so we got to look
[25:23] at this and see I was telling them this
[25:25] morning and I don't want to I don't want
[25:27] to sound
[25:30] really sacriligious but I'm going to
[25:32] tell you
[25:33] something if if Jesus walked on this
[25:36] Earth I said if that's for you not me
[25:39] and inside of that man was the Holy
[25:42] Ghost he was the Holy Ghost amen he just
[25:47] said he said the world will see me no
[25:49] more but you will see
[25:51] me because I'll be with you even what in
[25:55] you so look those same eyes you say
[25:58] you're getting too close I'm not close
[26:00] enough yet the same eyes that walk the
[26:03] shores of Galilee should be able when we
[26:06] look in the commentary of the word
[26:07] should be able to open up that vision of
[26:10] what happened and know that it was a
[26:13] reality cuz you were
[26:18] there you were
[26:20] there that's why only by the Holy Ghost
[26:25] can you get true revelation
[26:28] because the Holy Ghost was already there
[26:30] he already done the work now he's in you
[26:33] but what the problem is with us is he's
[26:35] got to work back out through the filter
[26:39] right of the carnal mind right he's got
[26:42] to work back out to the and the only way
[26:44] you can work out through that is this
[26:46] because I wasn't there physically when
[26:49] this
[26:50] happened
[26:52] but if the same spirit that raised up
[26:54] Jesus from the
[26:56] dead same
[26:59] we don't believe he's a third person we
[27:01] don't believe the Holy Ghost is a second
[27:03] person father son Holy Ghost third
[27:05] person right we believe he's the person
[27:08] well if that the person came to you at
[27:10] the new birth then then then he should
[27:13] be able to look back
[27:16] out look into the history that man man
[27:20] wrote this no doubt on
[27:23] paper but God put it together there's no
[27:27] way Mark could tell you or Luke could
[27:28] tell you cuz they weren't there now
[27:30] Matthew you could say Okay Matthew was
[27:33] there and he could write it down John
[27:35] was there and he could write it down but
[27:36] now definitely Mark and Luke was not
[27:39] there when Jesus was there so it had to
[27:42] come just like we've always said about
[27:45] Moses Moses wasn't in the Garden of Eden
[27:47] but I believe God just opened up a
[27:49] vision right of what happened and it was
[27:53] the truth see we sometimes we see
[27:55] Visions maybe in in our man sees a
[27:58] vision and it won't always come to pass
[28:01] but now if God shows you a vision that's
[28:03] why when we I was thinking about that
[28:05] when we were watching or listening to to
[28:08] brother brandham he's got his back
[28:09] turned to the
[28:11] congregation he says I see a man now
[28:14] he's lying if he didn't see him right
[28:17] he's looking right here that man is
[28:20] right back there right but he's looking
[28:23] at the man right here what God has
[28:26] opened up a dimension or opened up a
[28:31] television and he's seeing that man s
[28:34] because remember he said stand up and he
[28:35] said there you are he sees a man stand
[28:37] up you say oh that's for a
[28:40] prophet well okay it's for a
[28:44] prophet but we're supposed to be Kings
[28:46] and Priests we're supposed to be little
[28:49] Messiahs little eaglets little
[28:52] prophets right amen because look when
[28:57] when you come to that eagle anointing
[28:59] that was not just for William brandham
[29:01] he broke that open so that we can see
[29:05] listen you can't get a revelation
[29:07] without somebody already going
[29:10] there and bringing it to you and then
[29:14] when you see it amen God opens a vision
[29:17] for you either that or you have
[29:19] secondhand information
[29:22] amen and you know what secondhand
[29:24] information will do I can tell brother
[29:25] Mark something and by the time it gets
[29:27] to brother colle it ain't nothing I
[29:30] said I mean we've tried that before we
[29:32] played games like that why it's because
[29:34] my interpret his interpretation of what
[29:36] I said not exactly what I said now I
[29:40] said exactly what I meant but he
[29:42] interpreted it to brother dick some
[29:44] other way and then all the way back
[29:46] through here and by the time it gets to
[29:47] brother Kylie he's he just don't have a
[29:50] clue what I said but see that's not
[29:53] God When God says it he wrote it in a
[29:56] book he gave us the Holy Ghost he took
[29:58] the author and didn't send the author
[30:00] away he brought the author right back
[30:02] down here
[30:04] amen that's why on the day of Pentecost
[30:06] that that 120 in the upper room had been
[30:08] tutored what they took that word that
[30:11] that man Jesus had said held it in their
[30:14] heart and I'm going to read it to you in
[30:16] just a few minutes they didn't
[30:17] understand it right they did not
[30:21] understand it cuz you I'm going to read
[30:23] him in just a few minutes the Bible says
[30:25] and they understood him not right right
[30:28] right but now in the day of Pentecost
[30:30] when Peter comes out Peter says this is
[30:35] that right and now he you know you say
[30:38] well that's in Joel I believe Peter was
[30:40] inside of him he was boiling up he said
[30:42] this is that that this man for three and
[30:45] a half years has told us this is what
[30:48] come and now here we go all right and
[30:51] that's the same way we should be we
[30:54] should be when we get the Holy Ghost
[30:57] that that's why there's not much Holy
[30:59] Ghost
[31:00] around there's not much understanding
[31:02] sure you can get you can get
[31:05] knowledge the Pharisees had knowledge
[31:07] they had Moses's quotebook they said we
[31:09] have
[31:10] Moses that's not too bad if you got
[31:13] Moses if you got the god of Moses but if
[31:16] you just got Moses's Ten Commandments
[31:18] they're going to kill you well we have
[31:23] Abraham right Ain that what they
[31:26] said Jesus looked at them and said you
[31:29] don't have the same Father Abraham had
[31:32] and you don't have the same father Moses
[31:34] had and you definitely ain't got the
[31:35] same father I have right he said you
[31:38] have a different what he said you have
[31:40] they say he said you can read to me what
[31:43] you see but you are not understanding
[31:47] seeing they see but don't understand
[31:49] that's the same way with us being here
[31:51] 50 years in the
[31:53] message we've read and read and read
[31:58] and
[31:59] read and that's
[32:02] okay but we must understand right I was
[32:06] telling them
[32:07] downstairs and I I want I want us to
[32:10] really see
[32:11] this brother Brown preached to seals 50
[32:14] some OD years ago right and we have it
[32:17] in book form we can read it and that's
[32:20] the word of God to me that is that is
[32:23] the word of God hold on a minute that's
[32:24] not the word of God but it's the word of
[32:26] God brought
[32:28] the most plain of anyone has ever
[32:31] brought on the face of the earth except
[32:32] Jesus himself he put it in that book and
[32:35] it's plain now why haven't we took a
[32:37] rapture we read it most of you could
[32:41] quote half of the seal why are we still
[32:44] here we not getting what's on the paper
[32:48] right we're not getting it the reason
[32:51] being it's not written on that paper
[32:55] right now I don't want you to misunder
[32:58] understand me ever that we're looking
[33:00] for another word to come no another
[33:03] Prophet to come no no we got everything
[33:07] we need right what we're doing is though
[33:10] is we're doing just like Paul you know
[33:12] what Paul did when Paul said the letter
[33:14] kth you know what he's looking at he was
[33:16] looking at those Old Testament
[33:19] Scrolls the letter kth but the spirit
[33:23] giveth life same thing with the message
[33:26] of the hour the letter will kill you but
[33:29] the spirit behind the letter right is
[33:31] what will give us life amen the
[33:33] unwritten part brother told us many
[33:35] times the love
[33:38] letter will you tell me the seals are
[33:41] open I believe amen why are we still
[33:45] here I thought that was the greatest
[33:46] message ever preached and I was going to
[33:48] change our body why are we still here
[33:51] we're not getting what said right we're
[33:53] not getting we're not getting the full
[33:55] Revelation I was telling them this
[33:57] morning it's that onion peel you know
[33:58] you take you just keep peeling layers of
[34:00] the onion back we're getting part but
[34:02] we're not getting all of it we're not
[34:05] getting every bit of it so now
[34:08] watch let's look in in
[34:11] um let's go to Luke
[34:16] two CU we want to we want to see how
[34:19] this develops and then bring it up now
[34:22] this is when Jesus was 12 or 13 years
[34:25] old all right it came to pass that after
[34:27] after three days they found him in the
[34:29] temple sitting in the midst of the
[34:30] doctors both hearing them and asking
[34:33] them questions and all that heard him
[34:35] were astonished at his understanding and
[34:36] answers and when they saw him they were
[34:38] amazed and his mother said unto him son
[34:41] why hast thou dealt with us Behold thy
[34:43] father I've sought The Sorrowing brother
[34:46] brandham said you know what she done she
[34:47] let down to Bar there she was she lost
[34:50] her testimony he say oh that's bad John
[34:53] lost
[34:54] his John the Baptist lost his testimony
[34:59] right it's not bad to lose it but you
[35:00] got to find it again right and he said
[35:04] unto them how is it that you sought
[35:08] me you see that question how is it that
[35:11] you sought me are you coming looking for
[35:13] me as your son are you coming to look at
[35:16] me as my Father's
[35:20] son what'd he say because he answered
[35:22] he's he's asking wished you not that I
[35:24] must be about my father's business and
[35:27] they understood
[35:29] not the
[35:31] saying now wait a
[35:33] minute this woman knows that she didn't
[35:36] know old
[35:37] man and had this baby that's now 13
[35:40] years old she knows
[35:44] that yet they understood not the saying
[35:48] which he spake unto them right because
[35:51] what would have happened is he should
[35:53] have went back and like brother Ram said
[35:54] and started building cabinets and doors
[35:56] and windows
[35:58] that would have been his Earthly
[35:59] father's business but he said I must be
[36:03] about my father's business now what do
[36:06] we see though at after this 12y old
[36:10] statement he was 12 we don't hear
[36:13] anything from him till he comes back to
[36:16] the River
[36:17] Jordan right all right now is he just
[36:21] sitting under a tree for those years no
[36:23] I think he's developing he is he is um
[36:26] let me put it this way he's learning to
[36:27] live in a human
[36:29] body come on God had never lived in that
[36:32] human body before right so he was
[36:36] learning to live in that human body and
[36:38] then he had to fulfill scripture just
[36:40] like we said he had to be becoming 30
[36:43] because the priest could only handle
[36:45] certain things until he become 30 and
[36:47] then he could go in to the temple and
[36:50] Jesus could not break scripture all
[36:52] right now what was the father's business
[36:55] that's my question today my show us the
[36:58] father okay what's the father's
[37:00] business what is the father's business
[37:04] somebody want to take a stab at
[37:06] it the father's business was to be the
[37:09] son of man right think about it if he
[37:13] never was the son of man you and I never
[37:15] would understand him and the father's
[37:17] business is Jesus said about so many
[37:21] years after that he said repent for the
[37:24] Kingdom of Heaven is at hand right amen
[37:28] so the father's business is is to come
[37:30] as the son of
[37:31] man so that we can understand him right
[37:35] cuz God doesn't want us not to
[37:36] understand him right he's give us all
[37:39] these
[37:40] Avenues cuz the first Doctrine the
[37:42] prophet of God said Matthew 4:17 we're
[37:44] not going to we're not going to read any
[37:46] quotes today but we're going to read
[37:48] scripture Matthew 4:1 17 says from that
[37:53] time Jesus began to preach to say repent
[37:56] for the kingdom of Heaven is at hand
[38:00] right amen so he brought he is
[38:02] bringing through the son of man what the
[38:06] father wants him to say because he said
[38:08] I do what he said I do
[38:10] nothing I do nothing but what the father
[38:13] reveals to me first all right in other
[38:16] words when he would um go to um raise
[38:21] somebody from the dead the Lord I mean
[38:22] the father would already sh him that
[38:25] right the prophet of God told us he said
[38:28] God showed him four days ago that he was
[38:29] going to raise
[38:31] Lazarus right but then he comes to
[38:33] Lazarus and he says for your sake I'm
[38:35] going to
[38:37] pray there's a revelation in that that
[38:41] will not touch on this sermon but maybe
[38:43] another one he said he said I don't need
[38:46] to
[38:48] pray all you all he knew all he was
[38:51] going to raise him because what God
[38:53] already showed it to him what am I
[38:55] saying people listen we've got to be
[38:57] able to see this Revelation in a vision
[39:01] right but that Vision must be a reality
[39:05] amen amen hey Jesus was crucified before
[39:09] the foundation of the world right why do
[39:11] you have to come here and do that right
[39:13] your name was put on L's Book of Life
[39:14] for the foundation of the world why do
[39:16] you have to come here and be a
[39:18] sinner you had to come into this world
[39:20] into this Earth this domain to prove to
[39:24] Satan who God
[39:26] is that's just my whole thing that I see
[39:29] that God is so just he can't just say a
[39:32] there see most of us if we had that much
[39:34] power sister Anna we'd have this big
[39:36] head so I'm
[39:37] God I'm God I do what I want to yeah and
[39:42] he
[39:43] can but he is so
[39:47] much
[39:48] just till I believe he had to look at
[39:51] the Devil and say look I'm going to
[39:52] prove to you who I
[39:54] am but I'm not going to prove to you who
[39:57] who I am the way you think I'm going to
[39:59] prove to you who I am I'm going to do it
[40:02] in a bunch of
[40:03] people I'm going to do it in some people
[40:06] that you made fall in sin I'm going to
[40:09] bring out that that you think you've
[40:11] beat me with and I'm going to turn
[40:13] around and defeat you with the very
[40:16] thing that you think you've defeated me
[40:18] with cuz when he went what he went where
[40:21] he went to the Garden of Eden to stop me
[40:23] and you from coming on this earth
[40:26] right amen
[40:27] Satan came to stop All Sons and
[40:30] Daughters of God from coming to this
[40:32] earth and he did
[40:35] temporarily but God said I'll put enmity
[40:37] just hang on I'm going to put a division
[40:39] but in other words I'm going to bring
[40:41] that division back together how am I
[40:43] going to do it by the father's business
[40:45] right I'm going to come as the son of
[40:47] man and I'm going to bridge that Gap
[40:49] together so that we can sit here today
[40:51] in 2017 and understand a God that lived
[40:54] in flesh 2,000 years ago right
[40:58] you say we can't yes we the people of
[41:02] this hour will understand God in flesh
[41:06] more than anybody right that ever lived
[41:10] on the face of the Earth outside of
[41:12] Jesus Christ
[41:15] himself and we fall
[41:21] asleep makes us nothing but it makes us
[41:23] everything no one no one will understand
[41:27] this God in human flesh but us the way
[41:30] he absolutely wanted it because it's
[41:33] going to so bring everything together
[41:35] till it's going to change our
[41:37] body no one else like brother Dale's
[41:40] been preaching on the on the 77s and the
[41:43] 50 I hope you catch that I hope you
[41:47] catch
[41:48] that that we have to come into that
[41:51] Jubilee we have to make everything go
[41:55] free cuz there's no where else there's
[41:57] not another Jubilee to
[42:00] come
[42:02] amen and I I think about something other
[42:04] day and I just want to add a little bit
[42:06] to what he's saying about
[42:08] 2026 we we're going to pass 2026 we're
[42:12] not this world
[42:14] is do you know if if if everything blew
[42:17] up in 2026 that it's still going to be
[42:21] 30
[42:23] 26 Before Time ends right
[42:31] are we going to live a thousand years of
[42:33] Millennium and it's going to be still in
[42:35] time so we can go to
[42:39] 3026 in calendar time and and not break
[42:42] any Scripture right so you see you you
[42:46] look and you say well this has got to
[42:47] abruptly end no remember the Millennium
[42:49] is still seventh day we're actually in
[42:51] the 6,000 year the 7,000 year is the
[42:55] Millennium why listen
[42:58] I was thinking this last night Jesus I
[43:00] had a hard time last night did anybody
[43:01] have a hard time last night sleeping I
[43:04] had a hard time um Monica said she did I
[43:06] had a hard time sleeping for some reason
[43:08] but anyway Jesus Jesus if if we're the
[43:11] type if he's the
[43:12] type he
[43:15] rested remember on the seventh day the
[43:18] Creator God Worked six days and rested
[43:20] seven
[43:22] right Jesus Worked six days what day was
[43:26] he in the grave
[43:29] what day was he in the grave the seventh
[43:32] day he
[43:34] rested that seventh day and then he came
[43:38] into an eight Hey listen people when he
[43:40] come out of that grave on Monday on
[43:42] Sunday
[43:44] morning that's the new beginning he's
[43:46] wanting that's the one that's the a
[43:48] that's the eternity that were that was
[43:51] the future home walking on the
[43:53] Earth all power in heaven Earth has been
[43:55] given unto me I don't have to eat if I
[43:57] don't want to but I want to I don't have
[43:59] to walk through that wall but I
[44:01] can I've been so Bound for 33 years he
[44:04] said I'm free that was the eighth day he
[44:07] rested the seventh resurrected on the
[44:10] eighth and he was in an eternal
[44:13] body still down here in time you say he
[44:17] that can't happen that's what's going to
[44:19] happen to
[44:21] us cuz remember this world's going to
[44:24] live another Thousand Years
[44:27] in
[44:28] time and we're going to be
[44:30] Eternal we're going to be changed down
[44:32] here I I I I don't want to I don't want
[44:34] to scare you or surprise you but we're
[44:37] going to be changed on this side right
[44:40] here I didn't know if you knew that or
[44:42] not but kind of makes me happy me and
[44:45] Bob was I mean this makes me happy that
[44:46] I'm going to be changed over here I'm
[44:49] not going to have to wait and go
[44:50] somewhere and be changed I'm going to be
[44:51] changed right here even if I go by the
[44:54] grave I'm still going to be changed
[44:56] right here in this Dimension I'm getting
[44:59] off my sermon all right go
[45:02] back let's look at this man we
[45:05] call the son of man let's go to Matthew
[45:07] oh you already got
[45:10] nine now watch here we look at this This
[45:14] Man Called Jesus and we put him in a
[45:17] situation to where he comes up and says
[45:20] behold they brought to him a man sick of
[45:22] the paly lying on a bed and Jesus seeing
[45:24] their faith said unto the sick of the
[45:26] paly son of good cheer thy sins be
[45:30] forgiven now that really stumped them
[45:32] there and behold certain of the scribes
[45:35] said within themsel this man
[45:37] blasphemeth and Jesus knowing their
[45:40] thoughts said wherefore think ye evil in
[45:42] your
[45:43] hearts for whether is easier to say thy
[45:46] sins be forgiven thee or to say rise up
[45:49] and walk but that ye may know
[45:54] right with no question that you may know
[45:58] that the son of man hath power on Earth
[46:00] to forgive sins then saith he sick of
[46:03] the poliy arise take out thy bed and go
[46:07] up to thy house that really stomped him
[46:11] there in
[46:13] 96 because they said why do you how can
[46:16] you do that but he told them plainly the
[46:18] son of man hath power on Earth to
[46:20] forgive sins you know I always wondered
[46:23] the other day you know and we'll read
[46:24] this maybe next Sunday where Jesus said
[46:26] that that if you say anything against
[46:28] the son of man it'll be forgiven you I
[46:29] thought man that's God in human flesh
[46:31] why you say he said you can say
[46:32] something against me in other words but
[46:35] you say something against the Holy Ghost
[46:38] right that stumped me till the other day
[46:40] but not you look at the people that
[46:43] talked about Jesus that even his own
[46:45] mother doubted who he was at one time we
[46:47] just read that even though she knew who
[46:51] what she had done she still doubted
[46:53] right well God didn't hold that against
[46:55] her
[46:57] amen right the son of man was a human
[47:00] mortal man on Earth somebody could say
[47:03] something listen how many times did
[47:06] Jesus heal somebody and tell them say
[47:09] don't you say a
[47:11] word and never did they not say a
[47:15] word so what did they do now if it would
[47:19] be me and you say well that's lying
[47:21] against God no that's the son of man
[47:24] telling him say look don't tell nobody
[47:25] because I don't want all this Fame and
[47:27] Fortune but what was inside of him was
[47:31] saying Go
[47:32] Tell it had to be the Son of God go tell
[47:36] go tell them but the son of man was
[47:38] saying no don't tell anybody now how
[47:39] many times you reading the Bible if
[47:40] you're reading Matthew Martin Luke and
[47:42] John this is about my fourth time
[47:43] through Matthew Mark Luke and John go
[47:45] through Matthew Mark Luke and John and
[47:47] and look and see how many times he tells
[47:49] somebody don't say a word and one of
[47:52] them is is one in one scripture this guy
[47:54] is like screaming he's like running
[47:56] through the temple Temple I'm Healed I'm
[47:58] Healed Jesus said don't say I'm Healed
[48:00] I'm
[48:02] Healed no God was wanting his word
[48:07] out through
[48:09] people if you stay one son of man he
[48:12] resurrect it goes up into heaven and
[48:14] we're we're
[48:16] done that's why he had to come back in
[48:18] the end time folks that's why he has to
[48:21] come back in the end time right to do it
[48:24] through me and you
[48:27] the Son of God the Son of God can save
[48:29] your soul all day long but to get the
[48:32] real understanding of who God was is
[48:34] that man that was walking in human
[48:36] flesh that would tell his
[48:39] disciples the world will see me no more
[48:41] but you'll see
[48:42] me and then Phillip he keeps talking
[48:46] about this father and and philli says
[48:49] well well you keep talking about this
[48:51] man show him to us and and and we'll
[48:53] believe you in other words or or it will
[48:56] say
[48:58] satisfies he said
[49:00] Phillip have I not taught you the
[49:02] message for 50
[49:06] years did I not bring you the message
[49:08] and now it's 50 years after the
[49:10] messenger's gone and we still are
[49:14] here
[49:16] Philip have I been so long with
[49:20] you
[49:23] congregation has God been so long with
[49:25] us right
[49:28] if I'm like brother brandham if I was
[49:31] God I'd say it one time and that'd be it
[49:33] remember he said that he said if I was
[49:35] God I'd say it one time and if you
[49:36] didn't believe it that's it but see that
[49:38] wouldn't be Grace right that wouldn't be
[49:40] grace for us that would not be Grace but
[49:43] we do have Grace now let's go to the
[49:45] next one now continue on down Matthew
[49:47] 9:10 Watch What Happens and it came to
[49:50] pass as Jesus said at meet in the house
[49:53] behold many publicans and sinners came
[49:55] and sat down with him and his disciples
[49:57] and when the Pharisees saw it they said
[49:59] to the disciples why eateth your master
[50:02] with publicans and sinners but when
[50:05] Jesus heard that he said unto them they
[50:06] that be whole need not a physician right
[50:11] but they that are
[50:12] sick but go ye and learn what that
[50:17] meanthe will have mercy and not
[50:20] sacrifice for I am not come to call the
[50:23] righteous but Sinners to repentance he
[50:26] didn't come to tell
[50:28] us he came to show us he showed us the
[50:32] father he didn't just tell us about the
[50:34] father he he showed us the father then
[50:37] came him to the Disciples of John saying
[50:40] why why do we and the phes fast often
[50:44] but thy disciples fast not Jesus said
[50:46] unto them can the children of the Bride
[50:48] chamber mourn as long as the bridegroom
[50:49] is with them right but the day will come
[50:52] when the bridegroom shall be taken from
[50:54] them and then shall they fast in other
[50:56] words what do you tell them it's not
[50:57] going to do any good for them to fast
[50:59] now I'm here with
[51:01] them I'm here with them but when I leave
[51:04] it will be good for us to fast every
[51:07] once in a while to get everything out of
[51:09] the way so that God can speak to us so
[51:12] watch he's bringing it he's bringing it
[51:14] out now go to mark 2 I know we're
[51:16] skipping around a little bit
[51:18] but I like to skip around some now watch
[51:22] here we
[51:23] are here's another scene that the
[51:26] religious people of the world and it
[51:29] came to pass he went through the corn
[51:30] field on the Sabbath day and his
[51:32] disciples began as they went to pluck
[51:34] the ears of corn now does everybody
[51:36] understand what that is
[51:38] yeah it happened during Boaz and ru's
[51:41] time there was a tradition that when you
[51:44] gleaned your field you left the corners
[51:47] you would glean in a circle and if you
[51:49] had a square field you left the corners
[51:52] for the wayfar and stranger or the one
[51:55] that was poor because remember what Boaz
[51:57] say he said leave some handful of
[51:59] purpose leave some around the edges so
[52:02] that the poor people right can pick up
[52:05] food well that's what they were doing
[52:06] they were walking through the corn field
[52:07] eating corn and as the Pharisees said
[52:09] unto him behold why do they on the
[52:12] Sabbath day that which is not
[52:15] lawful now that's not even the law that
[52:18] very verbatim thing that they weren't
[52:20] cooking corn they weren't taking corn
[52:23] back to their house and cooking it and
[52:25] preparing it now that is against the
[52:27] Sabbath because you're not supposed to
[52:28] cook it's what it says in the Old
[52:30] Testament but they weren't doing that
[52:32] they were eating the corn as they were
[52:33] passing through all right but the
[52:35] Pharisees
[52:36] misinterpreted we're going to read here
[52:38] in just a minute this is one of the
[52:40] Traditions that they their
[52:42] interpretation of the word that that
[52:45] Jesus said you have made your
[52:48] traditions in other words the word of
[52:51] God and you've took the word of God and
[52:52] made it of none effect right all right
[52:54] and he said unto them have you never
[52:56] read what David did now he takes him
[52:58] right back to the scripture when he had
[53:00] need and was a hunger and they that ate
[53:03] that were with him how they went into
[53:05] the house of God the days of abath the
[53:07] high priest and did eat the shoe bread
[53:10] now listen he they didn't go in the holy
[53:12] of
[53:13] holies right amen all right they didn't
[53:15] go in the holy of holies God would have
[53:17] killed them but there is shoe bread in
[53:20] that second Court where the manora is in
[53:22] the second Court there's a shoe bread
[53:24] bowl for the priest to eat they went in
[53:27] there and eat the shoe bread which is
[53:29] not lawful to eat but for the priest and
[53:32] gave also to them which were with him
[53:34] and he said unto them the Sabbath was
[53:36] made for man not man for the Sabbath
[53:39] right therefore the son of man is Lord
[53:42] also of the Sabbath what he done he gave
[53:44] them a revelation of what he had said in
[53:47] that Old Testament and they denied it
[53:51] they called him
[53:53] Belo you think about that
[53:56] you think about that nowadays we we were
[53:58] talking about this
[54:00] downstairs all these doctrines and all
[54:03] these things that that and you take
[54:05] let's just take Daniel 70 weeks for
[54:08] example we brought the truth of Daniel
[54:10] 70 weeks I
[54:12] believe 99.9% of the preachers in this
[54:15] message said that we were false now what
[54:18] if we were
[54:22] true you're saying you're the listen we
[54:24] got to be the son of man yes not two
[54:27] people not one person a group but you
[54:29] know what if you believe what we believe
[54:32] and it's right then you're the son of
[54:34] man made manifest hello amen therefore
[54:39] the son of man is Lord of the Sabbath
[54:40] what did he do he put that condition on
[54:42] top of that that the son of man is not
[54:45] here to do away with the law right right
[54:48] but to show you what the law is actually
[54:52] said same way with the doctrines that's
[54:55] why we're still here people is because
[54:58] we don't have I say we I say everybody
[55:01] let's just let's just lump us all
[55:03] together we don't have the 100% true
[55:07] Revelation that son of man had 100%
[55:10] Revelation he wasn't just he didn't just
[55:13] have the Revelation he was the
[55:14] Revelation amen so we got to understand
[55:17] that's why I say whatever he is and
[55:19] whatever he went through and whatever he
[55:20] said has got to happen here Glory it's
[55:24] got to happen here amen there's no way
[55:27] it could we can't bypass it it's got to
[55:30] happen right and you know what if he's
[55:32] here that's my question to you if he's
[55:35] here he's got to do the same thing
[55:37] amen he can't do anything different
[55:40] that's right than what he came to do the
[55:41] first time amen he's forgiven sins he's
[55:45] the lord of the Sabbath in other words
[55:46] he's brought a revelation that they had
[55:48] never seen before right and they turned
[55:51] it down called him bbub told him he was
[55:55] a false prophet
[55:57] right so will they do
[56:00] today Matthew 15
[56:03] ver1 then came Jesus to to the scribes
[56:06] and Pharisees which were of Jerusalem
[56:08] saying why do thy disciples transgress
[56:11] the tradition now look the tradition of
[56:14] the elders it didn't say the word of God
[56:16] said why do you transgress the tradition
[56:19] of the elders they held that tradition
[56:22] of the elders higher than they the pure
[56:24] word of God right
[56:27] hello I don't want you to I hope you see
[56:30] one thing I'm not talking about when
[56:32] this was written 20 when this was I'm
[56:34] talking about now right that same devil
[56:36] the same God is here now amen doing the
[56:39] same thing amen doing the same thing why
[56:42] do thy disciples transgress the
[56:44] tradition of the
[56:46] elders in other words why do you preach
[56:49] that there's seven years left after the
[56:51] Rapture CU that's exactly what the Bible
[56:53] says
[56:56] I said that's what the Bible says right
[56:59] that's the word of God
[57:01] Amen for they wash not their hands when
[57:05] they eat
[57:07] bread I don't either a lot but he
[57:10] answered and said unto them look why he
[57:12] said why do you
[57:14] transgress the Commandment of God by
[57:17] your
[57:18] tradition for God commanded saying what
[57:20] honor thy father and thy mother now
[57:22] what's he doing he's bringing a
[57:23] situation that they come under he took
[57:26] he he's already told him I'm not even
[57:28] worried about this in other words this
[57:30] is foolishness right okay this is
[57:33] foolishness because transgressing the
[57:35] Commandment of God now here's the
[57:36] Commandment of God for God commanded
[57:39] saying honor thy father and thy mother
[57:41] and he that curses father and mother let
[57:43] him die the
[57:45] death but your
[57:49] Revelation but your Revelation says who
[57:53] shall ever shall say to his father or
[57:55] his mother it is a gift by whatsoever
[57:57] thou mightest be profited by me and
[58:00] honor not his father mother other what
[58:02] he done they bringing gift to the priest
[58:04] not even worried about what they're
[58:05] doing to their father and mother they're
[58:07] bringing gifts to the priest priest said
[58:09] oh you're okay now is that not the Roman
[58:12] Catholic s is that not the Roman novenia
[58:15] is that that that not we don't care what
[58:17] the Bible says but if you'll pay us a
[58:19] little money you don't have to honor
[58:20] your father or mother Jesus said uh-uh
[58:23] thus have you made the Commandment of
[58:25] God of no una affect by your tradition
[58:30] amen same way with you and I if it's a
[58:33] tradition right all right for God
[58:37] commanded we already said that all right
[58:39] we got that one all right let's go to
[58:41] Mark 3 verse one he entered into the
[58:45] synagogue and there was a man there
[58:46] which had a withered hand and they
[58:48] watched him whether he would heal him on
[58:49] the Sabbath day that they might accuse
[58:52] him I want you watch these spirits and I
[58:54] want you to be aware of them I think the
[58:57] Lord's trying to tell you you need to be
[58:58] aware of them now we need to be aware of
[59:01] them now it's just a good story to read
[59:04] if it's back then but if the son of man
[59:07] is here that same devil just came right
[59:10] on with
[59:11] him and they watched him whether he
[59:14] would heal on the Sabbath that they
[59:16] might accuse him and he said unto the
[59:18] man which had the withered hand stand
[59:20] forth and he said unto them is it lawful
[59:23] to do good on the Sabbath day or to do
[59:26] evil he asked him a question to save
[59:29] life or to kill but they held their
[59:32] peace and when he looked around about on
[59:34] them with
[59:36] anger being grieved for the hardness of
[59:38] their heart he saith unto the man
[59:40] stretch forth thine hand and he
[59:42] stretched it down and his hand was
[59:43] restored as whole as the other watch
[59:45] look at the question is it lawful to do
[59:48] good on a Sabbath day or to do evil or
[59:51] to save life or to kill but they held
[59:53] their peace they knew they better not
[59:54] answer that because because in the Old
[59:57] Testament several things
[1:00:01] look Sabbath day is on Saturday for them
[1:00:04] the seventh day right right but if you
[1:00:07] had a child and if he had to be
[1:00:09] circumcised he was circumcised on the
[1:00:11] eighth day after his birth if that fell
[1:00:13] on the Sabbath day guess what they did
[1:00:16] they circumcised
[1:00:18] him so they're going we're not doing
[1:00:21] nothing on the Sabbath but Jesus is
[1:00:22] turning around going wait a minute
[1:00:26] I know better than
[1:00:27] that and even the Bible says if you if
[1:00:30] your Ox gets in the ditch you going to
[1:00:33] pull it out if one of your sheep gets
[1:00:35] lost in the woods are you going to just
[1:00:36] leave him there no you're going to go
[1:00:38] find him but what he now look the
[1:00:40] tradition or the Commandment that they
[1:00:42] took was is to do nothing that's why
[1:00:45] they were called Hypocrites by Jesus cuz
[1:00:48] he knew they were doing the very thing
[1:00:50] they were condemning him of
[1:00:52] doing same today
[1:00:57] same
[1:01:01] today the religious people are the ones
[1:01:03] that's going to watch you because the
[1:01:04] sinner don't
[1:01:13] care think about that for a
[1:01:16] minute let that sink in for a
[1:01:20] second all right let's go to Luke
[1:01:23] 7 verse 31
[1:01:28] the Lord said where unto then shall I
[1:01:31] liken the men of this
[1:01:33] generation and what are they like all
[1:01:37] right he's fixing to tell you they are
[1:01:39] likened to children sitting in the
[1:01:41] marketplace and calling one to another
[1:01:43] and saying we have piped unto you and
[1:01:45] you have not danced we have mourned to
[1:01:48] you and you have not went for John the
[1:01:51] Baptist came neither eating bread nor
[1:01:53] drinking wine and you say he at the
[1:01:57] Devil the son of man has come eating and
[1:02:00] drinking and you say Behold a gluttonous
[1:02:03] man and a wine bibber right A friend of
[1:02:06] publicans and sinners but wisdom is
[1:02:08] Justified of all her children what's he
[1:02:12] saying here they are like children
[1:02:14] sitting in the marketplace calling to
[1:02:16] one another saying we have piped unto
[1:02:19] you and you have not danced right we
[1:02:20] have mourned to you and you have not
[1:02:22] wept for John the Baptist came neither
[1:02:24] eating bread or drinking wine you say he
[1:02:26] had a devil in other words what is he
[1:02:27] saying is you're saying he's got a devil
[1:02:29] now what are you talking about me cuz
[1:02:31] I'm I'm he must have ate and he must
[1:02:34] have liked wine this is him talking
[1:02:36] about himself you see what I'm saying
[1:02:39] when when we look at people and and we
[1:02:41] say well he he he can't be growing in
[1:02:44] Grace and knowledge cuz he still Cuts up
[1:02:47] what's that got to do with it that's
[1:02:48] that's being a person right but it's the
[1:02:51] word of God being made manifest right
[1:02:55] the son of man is has come eating and
[1:02:56] drinking but wisdom is Justified of all
[1:03:00] her children in other words what he
[1:03:01] saying you lack wisdom of anything
[1:03:04] you're supposed to be the most wise
[1:03:06] that's what Jesus I believe he got angry
[1:03:09] about let me paraphrase this Jesus is
[1:03:12] talking to the religious world he said
[1:03:14] look I came and gave you everything you
[1:03:19] needed I came I gave you prophets I gave
[1:03:23] you teachers I gave you men of God that
[1:03:26] read the word every day in your temple I
[1:03:30] am the one that come down the bread out
[1:03:32] of heaven and I'm the one that fed you
[1:03:34] when you needed
[1:03:35] feeding I am the one that came and gave
[1:03:38] you everything you needed for your
[1:03:42] journey and now I'm hearing human
[1:03:45] flesh and you're turning me
[1:03:49] down I come exactly the way that I told
[1:03:54] you I was coming
[1:03:57] I come exactly the way that I said 2,000
[1:04:01] years ago I was going to hit this Earth

[1:06:07] James and Joseph and of Judah and of
[1:06:10] Simon and are not his sisters here with
[1:06:13] us and they were offended at him his own
[1:06:17] family but Jesus said unto them a
[1:06:19] prophet is not without honor but in his
[1:06:22] own country and among his own kin the
[1:06:25] Bible is
[1:06:29] Southern hey we ain't done yet and he
[1:06:32] couldn't there do no Mighty work say

[1:07:20] brain around that we didn't mix baath
[1:07:22] and we didn't wear bathing suits and we
[1:07:23] didn't we didn't mix and me mingle with
[1:07:25] the world like that and drink and do he
[1:07:27] it's like who are you
[1:07:31] people well we're not of this world I
[1:07:33] started to tell him I said look we're
[1:07:34] not of here but you know what they're
[1:07:36] going to do they're going to Brand you
[1:07:38] just like they branded him right a
[1:07:41] heretic somebody don't somebody that's
[1:07:45] weird but he couldn't even do any Mighty
[1:07:48] Works he had to
[1:07:50] leave there's another scripture that
[1:07:52] says he had to leave remember what he
[1:07:54] did with one of them he had to take them
[1:07:55] outside right there was so many people
[1:07:58] inside that was unbelievers now you say
[1:08:00] that's God Almighty in human flesh it
[1:08:02] happens here it happens in your job it
[1:08:05] happens everywhere sometimes you have to
[1:08:06] pull somebody away and get alone with
[1:08:09] them to get to talk to to about God or
[1:08:12] talk to God with them because of what
[1:08:15] the unbelief this morning you see how
[1:08:16] hard unbelief is the son of man had to
[1:08:19] had to take somebody outside just so he
[1:08:22] could heal them because there was so
[1:08:24] much unbelief in the building
[1:08:28] I pray that doesn't ever happen here
[1:08:31] that we have so much unbelief that
[1:08:32] somebody can't get healed cuz brother
[1:08:34] random said one person in a
[1:08:36] congregation with unconfessed sin or
[1:08:38] unbelief can stop a person from being
[1:08:42] healed if you see me pray I stand right
[1:08:44] there and I lift my hands when
[1:08:45] somebody's being prayed for I don't pray
[1:08:47] for the
[1:08:48] person that's brother Dale's job when
[1:08:51] he's up here or the preacher I say God
[1:08:55] don't let me stand in the
[1:08:58] way clear my
[1:09:00] heart of anything that I'm thinking
[1:09:03] right any clear my conscience clear my
[1:09:06] heart I don't want to be the one that
[1:09:07] you have to say one day brother Mark
[1:09:09] didn't get healed because you were
[1:09:11] standing there thinking a bad thought
[1:09:12] about him or a bad thought about clear
[1:09:15] your thought get get that out of the way
[1:09:17] you say oh that doesn't work listen
[1:09:19] brother brandham would make people close
[1:09:20] their eyes when they would he would
[1:09:23] drive out certain spirits but now
[1:09:24] certain Spirits he didn't say that
[1:09:27] epilepsy and certain ones he said you
[1:09:29] better close your eyes why cuz those
[1:09:31] Spirits when they leave they go
[1:09:33] somewhere right I think we need to live
[1:09:36] a little bit more or maybe think a
[1:09:38] little more in the Supernatural realm
[1:09:39] because we are Supernatural people me
[1:09:41] and brother Bob was talking in the back
[1:09:43] uh and I'm just going to make this
[1:09:45] statement if we're sitting in Heavenly
[1:09:46] places and we're already resurrected
[1:09:49] sitting in Heavenly places your Soul's
[1:09:51] in another
[1:09:53] dimension it's not of this world
[1:09:56] if you're born again wait hold on Mane
[1:09:58] if you're born again your soul is not of
[1:09:59] this world didn't come from this
[1:10:03] world where'd it come from Genesis 126

[1:10:10] that inside of us why don't we let it
[1:10:13] out sometime Glory let it work you so

[1:10:22] experience I am if you're afraid to let
[1:10:26] it out all right let's go to this one
[1:10:28] because this one is the one we're going
[1:10:29] to end on and let you think about this

[1:10:50] confess also before my Father which is
[1:10:52] in heaven whosoever shall deny me before
[1:10:54] men him will I deny for my Father which
[1:10:56] is in heaven think not that I came to

[1:11:10] he's a prince of peace but he didn't say
[1:11:13] that he said think not that I am come to
[1:11:17] send peace on Earth right I came not to
[1:11:20] send peace but a
[1:11:24] sword I telling you what he
[1:11:27] said now we know he's a prince of peace
[1:11:30] I'm not denying that you know that too
[1:11:32] but what's he saying right
[1:11:34] here think not that I am come to send
[1:11:37] peace on Earth listen from the very time
[1:11:40] that man hit Earth there been Wars just
[1:11:43] over that one man right right right
[1:11:49] hello mohamad's fighting this one
[1:11:52] Judaism this one that one this one
[1:11:56] fighting
[1:11:58] Christianity think not I come to send
[1:12:01] peace now look you know what he's saying
[1:12:03] he's your Prince of
[1:12:05] Peace he's my prince of peace I have a
[1:12:08] world of Peace inside of me because I
[1:12:10] have the Holy Ghost but now this world
[1:12:14] is going to be destroyed that's right by
[1:12:17] that man because he's a righteous judge
[1:12:20] he didn't come to bring peace on Earth
[1:12:22] then when he hit this Earth he brought a
[1:12:24] word that's right he brought a sword I
[1:12:27] was telling him this morning we're on
[1:12:28] the on the uh second seal it says he was
[1:12:31] given a great sword what he was given a
[1:12:33] great word but what is Satan's great
[1:12:36] word that's right
[1:12:38] amen
[1:12:41] 99.9%
[1:12:44] truth we think oh no he's got this
[1:12:47] gruesome no one word
[1:12:50] off the great sword Satan was given is
[1:12:54] 99.9 % the truth and he just adds his
[1:12:58] one word and that's his sword but I came
[1:13:02] not to send peace but a sword for I am
[1:13:04] come to set a man at variance against
[1:13:07] his father a daughter against her mother
[1:13:11] the daughter-in-law against her
[1:13:13] mother-in-law a man's foes shall be they
[1:13:16] of his own
[1:13:18] household how many can verify that see
[1:13:22] there how many can verify that a man's F
[1:13:25] shall be they of his own household but
[1:13:28] now watch he that loveth father and
[1:13:30] mother more than me now he don't say not
[1:13:32] don't love you mother and father he said
[1:13:34] if you love them more than me you're not
[1:13:37] worthy of me and he that loveth son or
[1:13:39] daughter more than me is not worthy of
[1:13:41] me and he that taketh not his cross and
[1:13:44] followeth after me is not worthy of me
[1:13:48] so he did not come to bring peace on
[1:13:51] this earth right he brought peace to
[1:13:53] this earth but he didn't bring peace to
[1:13:56] this Earth because this Earth he will be
[1:13:59] the Prince of Peace of the earth when we
[1:14:01] get to the Future home that's right amen
[1:14:05] king of kings and Lord of
[1:14:08] lords but not right
[1:14:10] now he's king of kings and Lord of lords
[1:14:15] Big K little K Big L little L
[1:14:20] amen so you watch and see why somebody
[1:14:22] says well he's a prince of peace tell
[1:14:24] them say look in Matthew
[1:14:27] Matthew 30 uh verse 34 says he's
[1:14:31] not but
[1:14:33] remember he also talks and we'll cover
[1:14:36] it next Sunday we'll stop right here
[1:14:38] we'll cover it next Sunday he
[1:14:40] says I came in other words the the
[1:14:43] kingdom he he preaches that the Kingdom
[1:14:45] of Heaven is at hand but he said the
[1:14:47] Kingdom of Heaven since John is having
[1:14:49] to be taken by force right so so
[1:14:52] sometime and and the way I look at that
[1:14:54] is is some sometimes brother Dale myself
[1:14:56] some other ministers or deacons even
[1:14:58] have to handle a
[1:14:59] situation let's just say this is common
[1:15:02] everyday life we have to handle a
[1:15:04] situation sometimes that has to be a war
[1:15:08] because if you handle a situation look
[1:15:09] there's truth and there's
[1:15:11] error truth always trumps error truth is
[1:15:14] always truth error can be changed to
[1:15:18] truth amen so you have to take the the
[1:15:21] Waring Hey listen there's a variance
[1:15:24] right now going on in your
[1:15:25] head there's a variance or a war going
[1:15:29] on in your head right now of whether
[1:15:31] this is right or whether this is wrong
[1:15:33] or whether we really need to be here
[1:15:34] today or whether we need to be somewhere
[1:15:36] else
[1:15:37] right
[1:15:40] why because there's two forces right the
[1:15:44] devil and God there's two forces and
[1:15:46] Jesus was not immune to that when he
[1:15:49] came on the earth that's right cuz in
[1:15:52] Luke verse 10:21
[1:15:55] we'll we'll read it and then we'll stop
[1:15:57] there and that's where we'll start next
[1:15:58] Sunday but in Luke 10:21 in that hour
[1:16:02] Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said I
[1:16:03] thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven that
[1:16:05] thou H has hid these things from the
[1:16:07] wise and prudent and Hast revealed them
[1:16:09] unto
[1:16:10] babes even so father for it seemed good
[1:16:14] in thy sight in other words Jesus is
[1:16:17] walking through the world and he's
[1:16:19] saying father thank you that you've hid
[1:16:21] this in
[1:16:23] me cuz he he hadn't hid it in anybody
[1:16:25] else yet he said thank you Father that
[1:16:28] you've hid these things in me and that
[1:16:31] nobody's going to see me except my
[1:16:33] children nobody's going to see me except
[1:16:36] those that are born again of the same
[1:16:38] spirit that I'm walking around
[1:16:42] with all things are delivered to me of
[1:16:44] my father and no man look no man knoweth
[1:16:48] who the son is but the
[1:16:51] father and who the father is but with
[1:16:55] the son right and he to whom the son
[1:16:58] will reveal him amen you can't
[1:17:02] understand the Son of God without having
[1:17:04] a son of man on
[1:17:06] Earth the son of man had to come on
[1:17:08] Earth he had to do the father's business
[1:17:11] is to reveal himself in the Sun so that
[1:17:13] you and I can understand who he is so
[1:17:15] Philip says show us the father you know
[1:17:17] what if we would have been there take us
[1:17:20] back teleport us 2,000 years ago with
[1:17:22] the Holy Ghost we'd say Phillip if
[1:17:25] you've seen me you've seen the
[1:17:28] father whatever I do the works that I do
[1:17:31] though in other words I would tell
[1:17:33] Philip The Works that I do in a few
[1:17:35] short days you're going to do the same
[1:17:36] thing you're going to understand when we
[1:17:38] go to you go to Pentecost you're going
[1:17:40] to understand that is I'm saying if we
[1:17:42] could teleport oursel back past where we
[1:17:45] were standing there with Jesus because
[1:17:47] listen let me tell you something P we
[1:17:51] close even if you could do that if if
[1:17:54] you could take yourself with the baptism
[1:17:56] of the Holy Ghost and the word that we
[1:17:58] know now I believe Brother D you could
[1:18:00] take yourself right back there and put
[1:18:04] yourself in Jesus's shoes that's right
[1:18:08] and be the same thing yes
[1:18:12] sir that's a revelation folks you could
[1:18:15] I believe I could take anybody Born
[1:18:17] Again of the word of God baptized with
[1:18:20] the Holy Ghost in This Church age and
[1:18:22] take them right cuz listen if the son of
[1:18:24] man Ministry has come here where did it
[1:18:27] come
[1:18:31] from I come from
[1:18:33] God I go back to God sir Jesus said I am
[1:18:38] my father one you could stand there and
[1:18:39] I believe you could understand exactly
[1:18:42] what was going on so listen let me give
[1:18:45] you this point I think that we
[1:18:48] are not
[1:18:50] trinitarians but probably more tunist
[1:18:53] than we are anything else
[1:18:55] cuz we haven't really realized that that
[1:18:58] same spirit that is
[1:19:01] here for I tell you well hold on and he
[1:19:05] turned him to his disciples and he said
[1:19:07] privately blessed are the eyes which see
[1:19:10] the things that you see for I tell you
[1:19:13] that many prophets and Kings have desire
[1:19:17] desired to see those things which you
[1:19:19] see glory and have not seen them and to
[1:19:24] hear those things which you hear and
[1:19:26] have not heard them every Prophet amen
[1:19:29] every Prophet if they were sitting here
[1:19:31] today they wouldn't be half asleep like
[1:19:33] most of you
[1:19:34] are y'all must had a long night last
[1:19:38] night you better listen to this message
[1:19:40] again CU you only got a few sentences at
[1:19:42] a
[1:19:43] time
[1:19:45] but hey we all get
[1:19:47] sleepy but this should this should
[1:19:50] that's why I say about Tunis you what
[1:19:52] we're saying is is well that's Jesus and
[1:19:54] well well that's Jesus and well
[1:19:57] that same one thank you that's why I say
[1:20:02] we mostly are tunist we mostly I know it
[1:20:04] is that's why that's why we keep trying
[1:20:06] to preach this that's why we get up
[1:20:09] every Sunday and trying to get you to
[1:20:11] see that we're
[1:20:12] one inal fortitude yes it does it takes
[1:20:15] a lot of intestinal fortitude and some
[1:20:17] of us have a lot of intestine I don't
[1:20:21] know about the fortitude
[1:20:22] part but listen I do I think that we
[1:20:26] separate this thing too much that's
[1:20:28] right right let's be honest and all
[1:20:31] Shake our head and say yes well that was
[1:20:34] Jesus that was what he did that was back
[1:20:39] then that was then now let's come back
[1:20:42] up to 19 in the 50s and 60s well that
[1:20:45] was in brother brandham well that was in
[1:20:47] William brandham well did he take it
[1:20:49] with him did Jesus take it with him
[1:20:52] where'd he put it
[1:20:55] one more time where'd he put
[1:20:59] it so we are mostly
[1:21:02] Tunis be
[1:21:03] honest I just can't see understand that
[1:21:08] I am the same person that was standing
[1:21:11] saying this right here but I'm telling
[1:21:13] you that's the only way we're going to
[1:21:14] get out of here amen is to be that
[1:21:17] person am he said I only do that let's
[1:21:21] stand he said I only do that which the
[1:21:23] father shows me
[1:21:25] that's I only
[1:21:27] do so in other words he didn't go off on
[1:21:30] a false Doctrine so you know one thing
[1:21:32] for sure if somebody goes off on a false
[1:21:34] Doctrine he's not of his father he might
[1:21:37] be of his father but he's not of that
[1:21:39] father
[1:21:42] amen thank you well Jesus says thank you
[1:21:45] Father that you've hid these things from
[1:21:48] the eyes of the wise and prudent and
[1:21:50] revealed
[1:21:52] them to this seventh Church age yeah
[1:21:55] right this message of the hour the
[1:21:57] greatest message ever hit to face of the
[1:21:59] Earth you and I are the greatest people
[1:22:02] that ever hit to face of the Earth you
[1:22:04] say
[1:22:08] I jesus never had a day that he got up
[1:22:12] and said I might be
[1:22:15] God did he he never got up and said
[1:22:19] well I really don't know what I'm doing
[1:22:22] here now listen we as human moral men
[1:22:25] and women we do
[1:22:28] that but who's
[1:22:31] talking put that in the Bible it ain't
[1:22:36] there we really do and I I've always
[1:22:39] wanted to say that and I'm glad you
[1:22:41] agreed at least you did we're mostly
[1:22:43] tunist and we don't have enough
[1:22:45] Revelation to know that that same spirit
[1:22:49] that was in that man is in me looking
[1:22:52] through these same eyes looking at this
[1:22:55] same word and reflecting back off of
[1:22:58] that and we're able and I don't want to
[1:23:01] be sacrilegious again but I'm telling
[1:23:03] you I'm beginning to see
[1:23:05] things I'm beginning to see things I was
[1:23:07] talking to Bob about the dimensions and
[1:23:09] all but we should be able brother
[1:23:12] brandham told us one time he said if you
[1:23:15] if I could take the spirit of John
[1:23:16] Dillinger and put it inside of brother
[1:23:19] dick now what his mindset will be is is
[1:23:21] tomorrow at 9:15 he going to go case out
[1:23:25] of bank he's going to get his
[1:23:27] gun
[1:23:29] right right I'm going to get my getaway
[1:23:31] car and I'm going to go find out how to
[1:23:33] get away ain't that what John Dillinger
[1:23:35] did that was the spirit of John
[1:23:38] Dillinger in brother dick I'm going to
[1:23:41] my whole mindset is is I'm going to rob
[1:23:43] that bank at 9:45 because that's when
[1:23:45] the teller you see what I'm
[1:23:48] saying but if the spirit of him that
[1:23:51] raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
[1:23:54] you you what should you get up in the
[1:23:56] morning and
[1:23:59] do what should you get up in the morning
[1:24:01] and do yeah eat cereal drink coffee
[1:24:04] that's the human part of your body but
[1:24:06] what should you do you should walk forth
[1:24:08] showing Jesus Christ you should walk
[1:24:10] forth knowing that one day you might
[1:24:12] meet somebody that you need to talk to
[1:24:14] or somebody meets you and sees sees that
[1:24:17] you're a little bit different than
[1:24:18] somebody else and they ask that hey
[1:24:19] where do you go to
[1:24:21] church or or what what's you know what
[1:24:25] especially you sisters they go where you
[1:24:27] from I see you your Holiness or or you
[1:24:31] may be this or that well hey that's
[1:24:34] Jesus Christ that's as much Jesus Christ
[1:24:37] as me standing behind the pull pit cuz
[1:24:39] if I can't get nothing to you by that
[1:24:40] way maybe the sisters can get to the
[1:24:42] World by that way by their dress and
[1:24:45] their mannerism and not going out and
[1:24:47] and you know I hope to God that we don't
[1:24:49] are seen in bars and and shooting pool
[1:24:51] and on Sunday and all these other things
[1:24:53] but that that's for what that's another
[1:24:56] spirit that enters into a man to make
[1:24:59] them go do that our spirit that enters
[1:25:01] into US is we need to worship GL we need
[1:25:04] to come to church prayed up we need to
[1:25:07] come to church not just that day and
[1:25:09] that morning think about God because we
[1:25:12] got to come to the
[1:25:16] Tabernacle right because remember Jesus
[1:25:19] said your
[1:25:21] Traditions your traditions
[1:25:24] you pray
[1:25:26] loud you give you know this is way they
[1:25:29] were giving their tithe you know I got

[1:29:58] that's the way it should
[1:30:00] be and I was telling them this morning
[1:30:02] just just to finish up here I you know
[1:30:04] we're in the study of the seals contact
[1:30:08] but fell out we were stud we're studying
[1:30:10] on the seals and I think sometimes we
[1:30:12] we're we're right on the edge of our
[1:30:13] seat waiting for for not me but waiting
[1:30:16] for God to show we're right on the edge
[1:30:18] of our seat Well maybe he'll say
[1:30:20] something so mysterious that we never
[1:30:23] saw
[1:30:25] before that ain't
[1:30:27] it I know we all are just like you said
[1:30:30] about tunist we most of us are most of
[1:30:32] us are waiting for Brother Dale to come
[1:30:34] out with that one
[1:30:35] sermon that we
[1:30:38] go someday that'll happen but you can't
[1:30:41] just sit here brain dead until that
[1:30:44] happens I'm sorry but but you know you
[1:30:48] you start in and brother Brown said this
[1:30:50] he told the people they weren't getting
[1:30:52] it in the seal right he said you're not
[1:30:55] getting it on the questions and answers
[1:30:57] on the seals after the six seal he said
[1:30:58] you're not getting it it's not for you
[1:31:01] well I contend it's for us right he was
[1:31:04] preaching that
[1:31:06] sermon 50 years almost down the
[1:31:10] road to you and me so now what is it is
[1:31:14] it this new book that we're going to
[1:31:15] find is it this new tape we're going to
[1:31:19] hear forget
[1:31:21] that the Bible said that the perfecting
[1:31:25] of the Saints would come by somebody
[1:31:28] breaking the word down for you Apostles
[1:31:32] prophets pastors teachers and
[1:31:33] evangelists a five-fold Ministry to get
[1:31:36] us all
[1:31:37] ready some of you may like like like the
[1:31:40] way I preach some of you may some of you
[1:31:42] may like brother Dale and some of you
[1:31:43] may not that's what the fivefold
[1:31:45] ministry is for he gave some he didn't
[1:31:47] give all he gave some Apostles some
[1:31:50] prophets some pastors teachers but you
[1:31:53] got to have all five
[1:31:56] we got to have all five we can't be so
[1:31:58] narrow-minded because look I'm telling

[1:39:44] to come around and I was telling them
[1:39:46] this morning I want to tell you too that
[1:39:48] that watch and see uh Terence and Lisa
[1:39:51] and I some of us were talking about
[1:39:53] different people that are passing away
[1:39:54] around
[1:39:55] you do he different ones some people's
[1:39:59] been good to me have passed away drop
[1:40:02] dead if they're going to be given
[1:40:04] eternal life why's God God's not going
[1:40:07] to let them go through the tribulation
[1:40:08] he done the best thing in the world for
[1:40:09] him he put them to sleep for a little
[1:40:12] while he hid them in his
[1:40:15] Pavilion Book of Psalms I love that cuz
[1:40:18] he says hiding me in your Pavilion what
[1:40:21] is a pavilion it's a covering it's a
[1:40:22] cover and you run under it and there's
[1:40:24] no rain or anything can get to you
[1:40:26] that's what he's doing there's several
[1:40:27] people in our life terence's life
[1:40:29] different one of us that you look and
[1:40:30] see and you wonder why this person die
[1:40:32] I'm not talking about born again I'm not
[1:40:33] talking about Richard he's born again
[1:40:35] believer I'm talking about people that
[1:40:37] God is that's God going to give eternal
[1:40:39] life for being good to you right I've
[1:40:41] seen that three or four times close
[1:40:43] people that have been just dear friends
[1:40:45] of mine good but not Christian and they
[1:40:47] just die well what the that's we should
[1:40:49] glory in that right you say why are
[1:40:51] these people dying around me
[1:40:54] maybe God's going to give him eternal
[1:40:55] life because of
[1:40:59] you sometimes we think
[1:41:01] different sometimes we think and we
[1:41:04] think why is all these people dying
[1:41:06] around
[1:41:08] me if God's going to give them eternal
[1:41:10] life for being good to you why would he
[1:41:13] let them go through the tribulation he's
[1:41:15] doing the best thing he can ever do for
[1:41:17] him he'll hide them until the Judgment
[1:41:20] right they'll come up and be given
[1:41:21] eternal life right I'm telling you we
[1:41:25] ain't touched the surface of God's love
[1:41:27] we have never even come close but listen
[1:41:31] if the same
[1:41:33] mind that's thinking of these things
[1:41:35] that thought of these things before the
[1:41:37] foundation of the world he's come and
[1:41:39] he's give them to me and you right
[1:41:42] remember we supposed to have the mind of
[1:41:43] Christ if the mind of Christ comes to
[1:41:46] you then you can see things in a
[1:41:47] different light instead of like oh wo
[1:41:49] it's me wow he W he woo why is this
[1:41:50] happening to me and turn it into a
[1:41:53] blessing three people in that real close
[1:41:55] to me that was good to me they all died
[1:41:57] and you think oh he had this one died
[1:41:59] this one died and then the Lord just one
[1:42:00] night he just popped me up one night and
[1:42:02] he
[1:42:03] said I'm doing the best thing I can do
[1:42:05] for him that's right
[1:42:07] Hallelujah I'm hiding them until the
[1:42:10] storm's
[1:42:11] over I'm hiding them Duty he's hiding
[1:42:15] him until the storm's
[1:42:17] over much is given much is required
[1:42:20] that's me and you they wasn't much given
[1:42:21] to duty and much is not requ
[1:42:24] ired I love what brother Brown we had a
[1:42:26] prophet to tell us that those that have
[1:42:29] that are a little slow they
[1:42:31] have a special angel and God takes care
[1:42:33] of them and and what they're never held
[1:42:36] accountable he was never held
[1:42:38] accountable for the things that he did
[1:42:40] you say oh that just that's
[1:42:43] God that's God to me that would be
[1:42:46] something that I would not do as a
[1:42:49] human but the grace of God but the grace
[1:42:53] of God you say no he went to pooh Hogs
[1:42:57] and I watched him drink and he said a
[1:42:58] couple of bad words you know
[1:43:02] what that was not that was not
[1:43:06] so that's the problem with me and you is
[1:43:09] our
[1:43:10] memory that we somebody did me wrong
[1:43:13] somebody you know what if somebody done
[1:43:14] you wrong but he became Born Again
[1:43:16] baptized with a holy ghost you know he
[1:43:18] did it but God don't know he did
[1:43:21] it that's why you better watch you
[1:43:23] better be
[1:43:24] careful if that guy or or girl is born
[1:43:28] again what about that prostitute that
[1:43:30] brother Bram what was her name
[1:43:35] um what was her name the one that was
[1:43:37] The Prostitute and the
[1:43:38] drunk Rosella now listen let's just be
[1:43:42] honest all those men she was with knew
[1:43:44] what she was everybody that was around
[1:43:47] her knew what she was but when she came
[1:43:49] before a prophet and gave her heart to
[1:43:51] God brother said now she's testifying
[1:43:54] what he not he's not holding any of that
[1:43:57] right now I'm going to stand up if I was
[1:44:00] the one that was one of her people I'm
[1:44:03] going to stand up and go hey and God's
[1:44:05] going to
[1:44:08] go she didn't do that I see it that's
[1:44:13] why he said woman where are your
[1:44:15] accusers righten if Jesus would have
[1:44:17] seen her commit adultery he'd have had
[1:44:19] to killed her he didn't see it and he
[1:44:21] got rid of her accusers
[1:44:24] and he said 'woman I don't know what you
[1:44:27] did it's just a rumor right I didn't
[1:44:30] hear it and that's what this is this is
[1:44:32] just a
[1:44:33] rumor the truth is what's inside of us
[1:44:35] let's bow our head dear heavenly father
[1:44:37] we pray Lord that you go with us today
[1:44:39] be with us as we walk in this journey of
[1:44:42] life but as we walk in this journey of
[1:44:44] life may we see why we're here Lord and
[1:44:46] the things that we're doing now
[1:44:49] sometimes may look strange may look
[1:44:50] weird may even look strange or weird to
[1:44:52] ourselves
[1:44:53] but may we see now by the teaching of
[1:44:55] the word that we the son of man Ministry
[1:44:57] if we see what you did and the reaction
[1:44:59] and the action back then we should be
[1:45:01] able to see the same thing here you were
[1:45:03] walking through life saying your sins
[1:45:05] are forgiven go and sin no more well
[1:45:09] Lord what about a person that's good to
[1:45:12] us somewhere their sins are going to be
[1:45:14] have to be wiped out if you're going to
[1:45:16] give them eternal life what a great
[1:45:18] father that we have what a great husband
[1:45:21] that this bride has
[1:45:23] that has covered us and kept us Lord I
