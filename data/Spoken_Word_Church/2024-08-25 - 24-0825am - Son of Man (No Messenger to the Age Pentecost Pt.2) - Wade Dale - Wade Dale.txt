him bless us and lead us yes Vis went to F yesterday of a longtime friend I guess since we stay back in the country and this time of year we were short pants and Barefoot and this that's been so long

of God for our rulers are not a terror to good works but to the evil will thou then not be afraid of the power but to have Praise of the same that which is evil be Afra he for he is the Minister of wherefore ye must need be subject not only for wrath but Al so for the conscious sake for this are God's ministers render therefore to all that do tribute to whom tribute is due custom to whom custom is due Fear To whom fear honor to whom honor anything to love one another he that love another has fulfilled the law for this thou sht not commit adultery thou sht not kill thou sht not steal thou

have Victory amen um you know I I know most of you I'll share this with you for a second cuz it just reminded me of this we've always seen that sign and I've always known it as a peace sign I've known it as back in the 60s and' 70s people would do this but I see that a lot around the world and I started to research it I kind of thought well why is everybody throwing up peace and I realize in other places it doesn't mean the same as we thought it does this is a V for victory yes in a lot of places it's victory it means I'm happy I love you it's and I was thinking about we have the victory in Christ this morning no matter the circumstances no matter what the situation is there's a victory there that we can claim under the blood of Jesus Christ and that controls all things amen let's sing this together oh I heard an oo Story how a savior came from Glory how he gave his life on calary to save a rich like me I heard about his groaning of his Precious Blood of told him then I repented of my sins and one the victory oh Victory in Jesus my Savior forever oh he sought me and he bought me with his redeeming blood he loved me a I knew him and all my love is to him he plunged me to Victory beneath the cleansing FL and I heard about his healing of his cleans and powering how we make the lane to walk again and he calls the blind to see and then I CED dear Jesus come and heal my broken spirit and somehow Jesus came and brought to me the victory oh victory in Jesus my Savior forever oh he sought me and he bought me with his redeeming love and love me a I knew him and all my love oh is to him he plunged me to Victory beneath the cleansing flood and I heard about a mansion He has built for me in glory and I heard about the streets of gold beyond the crystal SE about the Angels

our Soul's good we know our soul is good but let's just pray that the body will come under subjection to that amen so let's bow our heads Lord thank you so much for the day you've give us thank you for the men and women Lord that have gathered together Under One Roof Lord to hear from you father so I pray Lord that they not hear a man today but they hear from you Lord may you do the speaking Lord you do the revela Lord You're the Healer you're the one that we look to Lord for all things Lord we look to you for for salvation different ones Lord our our family members and and people Lord that we're praying for to come in Lord It's Beginning to be a late hour and Lord we're fervently and prayer for the ones that are not with us anymore Lord that have went astray that that we don't see anymore father that we we long to see again father I pray that you'd just send your Holy Spirit to them and and strike their heart Lord and they'll come back to you father Lord bless this day forgive us of our many faults and failures against you we love you Lord for all the things you give us in Jesus name amen you got your Bibles let's turn to Revelations 1 we're going to uh talk a little bit more about the son of man uh Wednesday night um if you didn't uh hear that then Wednesday night tonight um it was something that we're going to continue on with telling about who the son of man is and the Son of God all right because it's the same person it's the same God everybody with me same God same Holy Ghost but different dispensation different manifestation all right the son of man lived among humans in a human body all right the Son of God lives in humans all right is everybody with me we can see the son of man see that's why when we get into this a little bit more you'll see that the son of man remember he said you can speak against the son of man and be forgiven why because he was a human mortal man learned by the things he suffered was made perfect oh yeah he was perfect on the inside but his body he had to eat he had to drink he had to sleep he had to do all the things the functions that you and I do because the Bible said he was tempted in all points as you are so everything you got tempted Jesus got tempted also but without sin see sometimes we we head toward the adamic nature again and and fall back and we do what we fall he never fell he never had to say father forgive me that's right but now that's the son of man that's what we've got to come to amen that's what we're we're required in this age to to be the son of man in a collective body in the end time right all right but the Son of God is to live inside somebody Jesus said he said you can you can say something against me and be forgiven he said but if you say something against the Holy Ghost why because that Holy Ghost is transferred into a human being and that human being is your judge if you've got the Holy Ghost today you're part of as we were talking about Wednesday the righteous judge why you take PE you're not supposed to take people to court brothers are not supposed to take Brothers to court that's wrong that's not even the well it is in the Bible it tells you you're wrong cuz you're supposed to judge here amen supposed to judge here don't worry about it there now listen if somebody hits you and knocks you off the road that ain't your brother unless one of y'all hit each other that don't mean about not taking cuz I had a question about that that it says a brother a brother two brothers sitting in this church okay needs to get together and come to an agreement not having to take somebody to court and sue them and all that stuff Christians should never sue a Christian but now as far as them out there that's the world that's different that's not Brothers out there that's the world so if somebody hits you and Wrongs you get you an attorney if you feel led to cuz they're not see what the problem is is you got the Holy Ghost they don't so they're always going to be contrary all right they're always going to see things different too all right so let's uh let's continue let's read and get into this now remember I had a brother send me a message the other day brother rown says there's no Messenger to this age that we're talking about all right which is the Pentecostal age ausa Street 1906 everybody with me now also we're going to see though that if we're Alpha and Omega in the alpha Al Alpha Church age there was no Messenger to to that Pentecostal age Peter was the spokesperson he wasn't the messenger they were waiting on a messenger named Paul Hallelujah in 1906 the Holy Ghost came himself but they were looking waiting for a messenger to come to straighten out all the Loose Ends so the two are just mere images of each other Revelations 1:10 I was in the spirit on the Lord's day I heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last in other words the first church age and the last Church age have got to be M images we just get a plus cuz we're heading to a body change all right what thou seest write in the book and send it to the seven churches and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and turned I saw seven golden candlesticks what had done God had divided himself when John saw him on Earth there was one Jesus the son of man now he was looking when he turned and looked he saw seven candlesticks spread out over seven Church ages 2,000 years the church ages but he saw Jesus standing in the midst of it so he knew Jesus didn't leave he was just coming into the people clothed with the Garment down to the foot and G about the pouch with a golden girdle so now Acts 2 verse1 and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them clothing tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost what about 120 people that didn't have it when they walked in and had it when they walked out oh what a mighty God we serve and there appeared on them clo tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing we're going to get into the isua street part probably this afternoon and show you that if you've never read about the isua street Revival you need to probably look on YouTube and and and and see what happened those people man the Holy Ghost was so powerful a policeman walked in the door to quiet him down and as soon as he walked in he got slain in the spirit and got the Holy Ghost during that meeting and began and joined them he was as loud as they was then you say that's funny that's the Holy Ghost that's how it's supposed to work but what happens we have all this I don't this and I ain't this and I don't that and you know this and you know that I don't this that's what happened because there was one I was watching it last night there was one older black sister that she was in the isua Street Revival this was a 1976 interview and she said the greatest thing that came out of the isza Street Revival was that everybody loved everybody then by 1915 when the Revival was over they split and you know what she said she said man got involved right oh boy she was she was preaching she knew what she's talking about man got involved and then they got Assembly of God you watch brother brandom he said y'all had it you had it in Aza Street and now you split into this one assemblies one one this one one don't have a uh any instruments and one has instruments then you got Jesus only and they baptizing only in Jesus name and they all just man just split apart but the whole thing was there was 600 million people were impacted by that one Revival in Ona Street one Revival in one mission that used to be a stable and a oneeyed black man preached and I'll read you what he said tonight this afternoon he wanted more of God he prayed five hours a day he said the Lord spoke to him and said pray some more so he started praying seven hours a day and that's when the Holy Ghost came on on isza Street on that day and filled him with the Holy Ghost and then here he started a Revival that went around the world so if you I pray enough we never pray enough amen we never do so if you look and see on the chart I think you can see that you see that started with a Pentecostal age it started with a Pentecostal age no Messenger to that age because Paul was not there amen Peter was a spokesperson that was somebody had to speak this is that all right he had to read the scripture this is that then you come all through the church ages well what happened during that church age all those Church ages man got involved again split split it off it didn't have to say Baptist Methodist that just come up in the our age but they split off into factions and you come up to Wesley and then from Wesley because um daddy they called him daddy Seymour William Seymour the black one eyy black man he had one eye because he had some uh tuberculosis or something when he was younger and it or sugar or something it knocked his eye out put his eye out but when he started preaching he was a Methodist preacher but God impressed in him one thing there's more there's more that's all God told him there's more he didn't tell him what he didn't tell him what scripture to read he said there's more so Daddy see more he come from Louisiana to Indiana to Houston Texas and then out to Los Angeles we'll look at it this afternoon that he actually was the one that spearheaded the whole thing just by telling the people there was one more work of Grace one more work because everybody from the Methodist though remember now sanctification under Methodist did put you into body it gave you the Holy Ghost under that anointing under Wesley's anointing the Holy Ghost fell on the sanctification the Sanctified life that they had but remember there was more God moved on Wesley people stopped I didn't say Wesley Wesley's people stopped so God said there's one more act that I got to get inside of you so that I can work through you cuz it got eroded so much down through time Doctrine is what kills us folks it's not your neighbor Doctrine is what kills us we must say under the correct Doctrine or we die that's right even with the Holy Ghost don't get quiet even with the Holy Ghost you can be sitting under false Doctrine but somewhere truth is presented to you you got to accept it that's why some of the people in Pentecost 1906 accepted brother brandom and saw that there was something even greater than just speaking in tongues was the evidence and they moved with him but the rest of them stayed stayed and said no this is it if you speak in tongues you got it don't matter how you live that's what they said speak in tongues and that's it so now look we were talking about the SE and we're going to get into the seals a little bit later but the first three seals that looses a Ministry in those first three Church ages even into Luther and Wesley and we come now to I was talking to somebody the other day and and they heard me make a statement that that we're living under the fourth seal well we are why the Rapture takes place on the four seale okay don't worry about time elements this is where the Rapture takes place Place brother Brown tells you in the fourth seal he says the Rapture takes place on the fourth seal because the combat Beast are gone in the fifth seal so that must mean that we're out of here the bride's gone all right but we'll get to that a little bit later some confusion to some you say well what about 56 and 7 56 and 7 is to take you to a body change cuz five is the greatest part of Grace and justification amen Wesley had sanctification but there's a great part of sanctification and that's in this right here then there's a greater feeling as we were talking Wednesday night I if you didn't watch look this is the Holy Ghost right here you receive the Holy Ghost in baby form right here amen all right then you grow in Grace and knowledge that's another that's not another Holy Spirit but it's another Act of that same holy spirit cuz remember you can quench the spirit your attitude that's right your way of doing things you can quench the spirit of God and you can hold it a that what the Bible said grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed brother BR said you grieve the holy spirit said he'll walk go out on the limb what does he do he doesn't come out of you come on people it's just an analogy have you ever been where you walked in dry places but you knew you were a Christian you were I mean you know you've had the experience you know you've had had the new birth but you're like Lord where are you where are you you help me in this well yeah you were a baby over here you helped your kids when they were little right righten we still helping them when we're older but let's don't all Shake our head about that but uh we are but we're not supposed to be right we're supposed to grow up Paul said what desire the sinal milk of the word but grow up all right grow up quit being babies it's okay being a baby it's not okay to stay a baby right so the opening of the seals tells us then the opening of the seals tells us that it's not just that as we were talking Wednesday night there's something leaving when that seal open something left when the second seal open something left yes come and see that was a true word lion ox man and Eagle over here saying John John John taed to what the bride John come and see not come and see come and understand what's happening John didn't know everything that was going on but he knew enough to know that when that Thunder went off he was about to write it down and God said no don't write it why cuz it's a revelation contained in the seals that we got in the end time that that John may have not known exactly what that black horse did but he did see it but we know what that black horse does we know what the Pale Horse does we know what the red horse does because remember John can be fooled because he was fooled in Book of Revelations because remember he stood and admired the remember the angel had to say John he admired her why you get caught up in all this pretty let's don't get caught up in all this pretty that is the street Mission they had to sweep the horse poop off of the floor to have a because it was a stable but the Holy Ghost was glad to be in that building with those people loved to be there that's where he wanted it to be same way with me and you but there was a Ministry loose there's always a a true Ministry and a false Ministry always loose together the true Ministry goes out first then there's a false that follows behind it all right and anything contrary to God is false absolutely okay one word off as Brother Richard Wilson said one word off got us over here where that horse was riding I was reading I didn't bring a quote I think I'll bring it this afternoon but it was back in the the 50s brother R was preaching and he said see there he was reading Revelations where the six the fifth seal Jew he said that was the Saints under the altar well he was wrong people hate it when you say that amen he said he was wrong I didn't have to tell you he said he was wrong he said I have made a horrible mistake he said I've been looking at my old notes and it's totally contrary to what I was preaching before but thank God he knew right then to me I'd rather like Dad said I'd rather know that I was WR wrong right then cuz he knew then he was working in a real that it wasn't him it was God it wasn't his ideas filtered through God's mind no it was God's mind filtering through his telling him the truth those were Souls under the altar crying how long to avenge our blood Christians don't do that that's right okay I believe in progressive revelation you progressed as a human didn't you but there was a Ministry loosed in those first church ages there was a Ministry loosed in every Church age am all right so the first three ages the pure word of God and we'll get to this in just a minute I want you to see something because when the Holy Ghost fell under the day of Pentecost ad30 or 33 brother around says to but back there that fell on a different group of people hello then what fell in 1906 that's right not the different for Holy Ghost I said different people these people here were tutored by God himself they had been Justified they had been Sanctified Jesus said sanctify them through thy truth th word there was a pure word of God and when that Holy Ghost Struck it they took off they were what faith of the fathers everybody with me now over here in the zeusa street that was not true they were they were trinitarians they baptized the name of father son Holy Ghost they let women pray pre all those things over here but the Holy Ghost fell and was pleased to fall on them just as pleased as he was to fall in this group over here cuz remember God's not a respected persons and he can't change all right he fa the same way but what they did with it was two different things all right so that's why we need to learn how to grow we can go through dark times we can go through these ups and downs but there's got to come a time to where you know that you know that you know that you're standing in a place you're supposed to be standing in you're not standing back here you're standing in this age right here today and when the word comes to you you go what you just like had it right that ain't nothing but the truth amen hallelujah so the fourth Church age the word went into the ground it died the word didn't die we know that the effects of the word died right but Jesus said except the corn of wheat fall to the ground it's going to abide alone right right so it had to go through the process of justification cuz all that was lost I want y'all to understand something when brother random comes and preaches and he starts preaching on justification and sanctification and baptism of the Holy Ghost that's what param uh and William Seymour had already preached that wasn't something new what was though they said this is it no more brother Brown said this is it plus this is it plus the growth you got to grow you can't speak in tongues and have a like brother Brown said a temper to fight a buz saw you can't do that all right that's Pentecostal so the fifth Church age we see that come the justification it was preached correct but it was not the fullness it was only what restoration it was reforming but it was becoming restoration but they were reforming the people into seeing that the just as we were talking Wednesday night the just will live by faith there's no there's no other requirement to a Believer except believe you see all these other things it all comes down to believing why did you get up this morning why did you put on your clothes why did you come to this church or any other Church why I hope you believe that God was going to see you here meet you here and help you here if not you just came here to to as brother R said sometimes people just come to church just to refute what's going on I you don't have to amen none of that if you don't want to but it's the truth anyhow the devil got here before y'all did oh yeah okay he's still here now amen but we got to come to a place though that we know that our sins are forgiven the just will live by faith and that you're just as just as God is if you have the new birth oh I don't I don't see there take the eye out and put the hym in yes sir I can't no you can't because you just said you can't the Bible says I can't do all things who Christ not what he say he said I can do all things through Christ that strengthens me all things oh I got this struggle I got this F so nobody's went through what Jesus went through they hated him his whole life rejected him and killed him yes so justification now remember it eradicates by faith in what Christ did the sins of your past nature even in the Book of Romans it tells us we were talking about Wednesday night it declares his righteousness for the remission of sins that are passed you can't ask God to for you know you know well as I do tomorrow's Monday and if you work you're going to sin I don't know about you that are retired but if you work you're going to sin yeah boss is going to do something the somebody's going to cut you off on the highway hello well y'all pray for me Monday's the worst day at the post office so this just Monday's a bad day but um you know what that's not supposed to affect you come on I'm looking at every one of you that's not supposed to affect you you're supposed to stand up above that let everybody else around you complain and Rattle and Roll and and and uh I didn't this and I couldn't get out of the bed and I somebody you're supposed to say how you doing wonderful brother Dale says perfect fine I'm good all is well have we heard that message as the Bible as the song says have we heard the message Shalom have we heard that all is well have we heard to me that's the good news that everything's okay don't matter if the world's falling apart they're in political turmoil Iraq Iran hallelujah it's going to happen yes but we've been equipped for it I'll read you this afternoon we're in the astronaut age we' really got way up now that's right but I'll give you a little I give you a little uh a little hint in 19 1906 when the Holy Ghost Fell onusa Street brother brandham said that was the airplane the right Brothers flew their first plane in 1905 by 1907 they had um produced a fixed wi airplane brother BR said whatever man whatever God's doing man duplicates it on Earth so when God came to the countdown brother I'm preaching the countdown that we're an astronaut age guess what they started shooting people up in the sky and now we can fly them up there in the same vehicle and bring them back in the same vehicle all right so let's just do the same way with the word of God because remember there's no limit out there we're limited to gravity here once you hit past gravity There's No Limit don't let Gravity the gravity of sin Hold Us Down the gravity of worrying and wondering and I know it's hard to do as a human but you got to believe that God is in everything you do everything now the garbage no but sometimes we have to go through garbage to get to the truth amen everybody all right so he's going to we're going to ask for our sins to be forgiven which is the sins we've done in the past you can't ask for forgiveness the sins you've done in the future because you don't know that you've done those God's not listen God doesn't just throw a blanket out there you you got to ask him to forgive you what you done Lord just forgive me next day Lord just forgive me forgive you what he wants you to confess cuz he's the high priest of your confession confess to him what you did hallu amen therefore we conclude a man is justified by faith without the Deeds of the law as brother Luis was talking about the law laws want to kill you all right but Justified freely means it doesn't mean that you're forgiven we got to come to the conclusion that we never did it we've actually got to come to the Revelation that we never did it amen and if you're born again today everybody close your eyes every person in this building close your eyes your inner being is all you can see right now all right you don't see in your neighbor you don't see tomorrow yesterday your soul if it's born again is just as Eternal as God is and when you open your eyes you're opening The Eyes Of God now do we believe that amen okay open your eyes then you Open The Eyes Of God if you're born again in your soul you're just as the Eternal as God is look you're just but we got to work on that second man the memory reason conscious affection that's what we're preaching to now brother Dell said remember he always preach of the Soul that's what we're doing but once you get the soul converted you got to head toward the outside guy right that's what this is for yes cuz remember if you're soul is the soul of God is that all right that's right if your soul by the new birth is the soul of God it's already got them but the problem is though we've got a piece around it like this it's called Humanity it's called your old nature it's a cap capsulated that Holy Ghost and won't let it out but just every once in a while that's how I remember it was sealed up that's why brother R had to come he had to come to unseal what the word of God in its Purity to show us we're already redeemed we're already sitting in Heavenly places we're already perfect we just got to walk to it what is sanctification it's a walk justification is one act God for for gives you your sins throws you in the sea of forgetfulness right here God can see your sin no more for they're buried they're buried in the sea of forgetfulness think of a sea of forgetfulness God cannot remember them no more so why do we bring them up why do we keep bringing them up cuz Satan is the one that reminds us of that God's not going to remind you of your sins if he forgives you of them listen you know why he can't you say my God can do everything but there's one thing I I know he can't do he can't remember my sins if a in to see of God's forgetfulness never ever ever will I have to be forgiven for that again now we sin every day so it continues on but you got to come to a place to where if your soul is born again today it never did Sin that peace and part of God will get to the Genesis 126 man when we get into the seals that's where that person come from that's where you hear from your theophany that's where you sitting in Heavenly places listen on Monday morning at work you're not sitting in Heavenly places but your soul is yes sir by the new birth so that's why I keep saying let it out let that joy and peace let it out why get bound down with so much garbage man I mean just let it go and keep going let it go and keep going because they are both dead and buried it cannot be even remembered by God anymore that's right can't be remembered by God yeah that's something he can't do he can't remember my sins but you know what he had to choose that and make a place for it and where it was at under the blood when he died at Calvary that's the Sea of God's forgetfulness that sea is red if you didn't know what that was it's not a blue sea it's a Red Sea why do you think the children of Israel had to go through the Red Sea why was it called the Red Sea why was the Wilderness called the Wilderness of sin not by not by chance no not by chance because remember everything they did was an example for us yes as brother Luis was talking this morning it's all an example but we got to get out from under the law so that Grace can take over but then you know if we were if we were real legalistic we'd be sitting here just like I was and I was listening watching brother Lis and I'm like man it's just Grace everywhere just slather it with with sugar and then brother collie reads that that you got higher powers and you got to listen to them so it looks like two different things but if you mold them together it's the exact same thing exact same thing brother collie read the same thing brother Luis was talking about he just did it brother brother they did both did it with the Holy Ghost but you got brother collie reading it to where we got to be submissive to the higher power we got to have rules and regulations we got to have certain things but we don't have to Louise beat everybody over see so you put the two together it's law and Grace but Grace is what greater than law all right Grace is what put Christ in on the cross right wasn't his wasn't for him it was for us for our Grace so there's the Tabernacle and we see the outer Court was you got all kind of stuff going on in justification you still got all kind of stuff going on on I young people don't get discouraged if you make that move with God and then all hell breaks loose cuz you know what all hell's going to break loose I'll promise you that amen yes sir did with me but what is Satan is trying to upset because remember he's spiritual he can feel a spirit before you can he can actually fill the spirit of God before you can oh yeah he can he's more spiritual than we are he's in that spiritual realm where everything happen boom boom boom boom boom and we're in this realm where it just happens it's so slow that's why brother Brown said you make a move toward God what does he say Satan moves Satan moves in and tries to what cut that off many many times he said in the in prayer lines don't let s don't let Satan cut that off he said get the blessing he is a spiritual creature don't ever forget that Satan's spiritual sir he's not a natural human being he's a spiritual being God made to stay in one place and he didn't all right so let's move on just a minute to sanctification cuz we're going to come to something this afternoon to where when they went to isua Street they were living under a Sanctified life no jewelry no watches long you know just like the old we used to see the old Pentecostal that's what they started under because that's what sanctification was to them that's what the Holy Ghost was to them was trying to put on you hear me people trying to put on a Pure Life right you can put on all you want to but someday somehow someway whatever our weakness is ours is going to pop up before usely you can suppress it you can do this you can even deny it but I'll promise you until that thing dies it'll always always come up but it's got to die and when it dies like brother Brown said I read y'all the other last Wednesday night when that when that sin dies there's no Resurrection for that sin absolutely there's Resurrection to life in Jesus Christ but there's no Resurrection for that if you confess it and put it under the blood it can never come back up you can't be accused we don't even have a statute of limitations in the in the in Christianity when you're s when you're done it's done yes when you're forgiven you're forgiven you don't have to go to court Christ went to court for you he said I'm pleading their case I am their Advocate I'm standing for them yes sir amen right that's why brother Brown said and the Bible said you stand for him he'll stand for you okay you had to make a stand to even get Justified and Sanctified you had to make a move yes you didn't just sit in your seat with your arms folded and slept during church there was something lit inside you called a fire and it was a fire of God it wasn't the holy ghost in your soul but it was the Holy Ghost cleaning you up so he can get in your soul that's what we need the same thing even with this right here we need this Holy Ghost right here give us some more fire amen you know they heat the fire seven times seven Church ages but remember at the very end when they went in that fire it didn't matter if they heated it 10 times 50 times cuz God was on the scene you know the belief was that he saved them in the fire and that would be cool brother Danny you know people tell the story that would be good but when they walked out the Bible even says that their their feathers were burnt to a crisp and their clothes didn't even smell like smoke that's how God cleans you up your clothes don't even smell like smoke what about a mighty God we serve he just cleaned them so much he put them in another dimension he put them in another dimension cuz in this Dimension they burn but then of course Nebuchadnezzar looked down and said hey I see four didn't we throw three yep I see four the Fourth Man In The Fire is one that'll save you amen so now remember the Philadelphian Church age was a great missionary age we'll get get to where we need to go but remember there was lap overs we we understand through the scriptures that each age laps over each other all right everybody with me there's not just an Abrupt end of sanctification and then you start with the Holy Ghost no param and seore and John G Lake and all the different ones back then they knew there was something else but they stayed in the sanctification until they did something come something else come all right and then when they started preaching that they knew that sanctification wasn't in it was just a second work of Grace see there's a revelation God was revealing to them God revealed to a oneeyed black man That Couldn't Write his name that there was another work of Grace called the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen they even said this I was reading or watching one this morning one of the old sisters she was in the zza Street Revival she was really old back in the 70s she said didn't matter it said you didn't ask what color the man was preaching the man just preached he said she said we didn't look at racial barriers we he said we had Chinese Russians there was a big Russian group out there in Los Angeles they had we had Russians but the whole thing was is it struck me because on the this day of Pentecost over here remember they spake with tongues right but remember what was strange was they were heard in their own language abut if Russians got up and spoke in tongue the Russian people heard it but the American people heard it in American language that sister said the same thing she said them Chinese start speaking in tongues and she said it was just like they was talking to me speaking in English so that's a way that God speaks to people not just speaking in tongues and babbling around and not saying nothing come on they heard in their own language the hearing is more than the speaking are you hearing in the language of God today are you hearing in the language that God has for this time today doesn't matter if I'm speaking in Russian or whatever it is are you hearing the voice of God are you hearing what God's got for us it's my question to you so what God had to do before isusa Street he had to clean the people up put them through Wesley where tea was not any good and don't wear any jewelry and do this and don't that they had a method of doing things that's why they're called methodists All right but then God was was ready and waiting though for somebody to catch a revelation so the oneeyed black man said he said God there's got to be more I'll read it to you tonight he said God there's got to be more and that's when God said pray more and he was already praying five hours a day how many of us pray five hours a week I don't want your hand up you never pray five hours a day though unless you pray without ceasing but there's sometimes that prayer is not appropriate to things we do hello yeah well pray for me sanctification is becoming more holy through time like Paul said I Die daily yes the things I used to do I don't do anymore yes sir right that's what we've got to do that's what that old sister said she said she said them old things we used to do she said they was gone said we walked into church and said said you could just one old man was there he was a minister and he said you could just F the Holy Spirit pick you up he said you could walk in a church anywhere in Aza Street or anywhere around there and he said it was like the Holy Ghost would just reach and grab you and pick you up you say that was for them same Holy Ghost we got more word than they did right we don't have we've got the unadulterated word of God that's what I'm going to hammer when we get to brother br's real true Ministry which was in the seals we got to come to a place see it's like a child growing into adulthood Christians become more Sanctified over time this means that Christians should expect to make progress if you've been doing something 20 years you're still doing it the same way you'd been doing it 20 years ago you got a problem we all got a problem so this means that Christians should expect to make progress to grow and become more loving kind humble and self-controlled over their life brother Brown says look said you're begotten of the spirit at sanctification that's why sanctification and the Holy Ghost is so close so close because what God does he cleans you out the unclean Spirit goes out you're trying to you're trying to live a a good life but remember if you exchange that for saying I got it because I feel it you're in the devil's territory right that's right God didn't say you feel it he said did you believe it did you believe it's for you do you believe it's for your children your husband your wife people that are not not saved but remember it's like brother Dale said always if you live like a hound dog and expect your kids to live like a Christian there's a problem there if your pre if your kids are not serving the lord look at your life don't look at theirs oh play God I do I look at mine to see what they're looking at you don't come to church they don't come to church you don't read your Bible they see you doing other things they see you cussing and or not cussing but amen we got to get back to that Sanctified life all of us do we all got to get back to being more Sanctified knowing that God will clean us up up so that our kids will want what we want what we got brother Brown said be salty don't don't I mean pray for them every day but live something in front of them don't compromise if you compromise that's the first thing your kids going to say h well Mom and Dad they don't come to church on Sunday afternoon they just you know we go out we well you won't have to worry about that in two weeks a baby got life in the womb little muscles are quivering it's a life all right see sanctification is a life CU it's an act of the Holy Ghost yes listen no one can clean you up except the Holy Ghost that's right that unclean Spirit cannot leave you without the Holy Ghost doing it cuz you don't want it to leave you pet the thing you like it ain't that what brother R said about that woman they saidwell that Spirit came back on that woman brother R said cuz she liked it the unclean Spirit goes out God had to drive it out but now remember God's a gentleman until you ask him to fill it with the Holy Ghost and seal it Satan can walk right back in and make you feel so religious and put all your signs up on the wall put all your all your uh cloud pictures and all that stuff and be just as dead as a doornail but it's a different life when it breathes the breath of life into its nostrils it's a different then he said my dear Methodist brother Pilgrim Holiness Nazarene these are the people that came out of that move in 1906 of zud Street the baptism of the Holy Ghost is different from sanctification it's a work of but it's different sanctification is the cleansing which is preparation of life but when the Holy Ghost comes it is life preparation is cleaning the vessel the Holy Ghost is filling the vessel yes sanctification means clean and set aside for service the holy spirit is put in service you are the vessel that God has cleaned up all right is everybody with me all right real quick now we know we read about the unclean spirit so let's just keep going right here I want to see something right here now we know what the in court what was the in court the in court you might not be able to see that though but the interc court was what there was as brother Luis was talking about this morning there was the Sho bread there was a Candlestick table and shoe bread now remember those were all man-made manmade the candle man had to fill the candle with oil to keep it going man had to make the shoe bread right now this afternoon when we start talking about the holy of holies what's inside there the Ark of the Covenant that God wrote on the T on the tables of stone God created the Mana that's right that was put in there also and Aaron's old dirty Rod was put in there that was dead and and it budded under what the power of God so man didn't do that man could plant an almond tree sure enough he'd grow up and produce almonds but a stick that was dead that you laid it wasn't connected to the ground nowhere what am I saying man can get involved in sanctification man can get involved in justification but when you go into holy of holies it's God Almighty and and that's it nobody else but you and God alone so the shoe bread was made let's continue on now brother Luis was talking about the Tabernacle Candlestick table shoe bread now the after you go through the next Veil which is the golden sensor Ark of the Covenant and then the pot with Mana in it Aaron's rod and the tablets of the Covenant which are the Ten Commandments that we're inside that Ark now real quick just for a second Luke 24 behold I send the promise of my father upon you but te you in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued or sunk into that means sunk into with power from your brother power from the church no it says power from on high amen all right that power's got to come from somewhere besides Earthly power that's ain't that what the lady said a what the sister at the well said she said we worship in Jerusalem Jesus said there's going a time when you got to Worship in spirit and truth yes Mark 15 says Jesus cried with a loud voice and gave up The Ghost and the veil of the temple was rent from top to the bottom let me tell you something you guys were all temples if you got the new birth you are temples God's going to rip that Veil open so that man can see yes if you let God rip it open from Top to bottom come on somebody from top to bottom rip it open and let the world see what's going on inside that's what God wants now back then it was death to see that but now it's death not to be able to see that and and have a piece of that have a part of that we' read this before when the day of Pentecost was fully come now you know what Penta is Penta is five that's why the Pentagon is made in five sides Pentecost which was the Jubilee the 50th year the Jubilee now remember that hasn't been that hasn't been instituted it was in the Bible but the Jews never did it because remember the 50th Jubilee everything went free yes okay everybody with me there was a jubilee ever seven years but only certain things went free some had to stay something went free something had to stay you were enslaved oh come on somebody you were enslaved until that 50th Jubilee and then it didn't matter it didn't matter what man said it didn't matter what your owner said devil when that son comes up on that 50th Jubilee you're not mine I'm not yours anymore I'm going to be set free I'm God's now well that's what happened when you got born again you had a jubilee you had a Pentecost L you should have had a Revival inside of you cuz you got to go free everything went free you got all the blessings of God you never had to go back you threw those implements down and you went and did your thing God restored everything back to you God restore all of our children restore all of our parents anybody that's not serving the lord claim them it's your Jubilee the sun's up but the sun came up on the day of Pentecost right here they were all with one Accord in one place they weren't fighting and fussing suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as a rushing Mighty Wind that filled the house where they were sitting and there appear on them clothing tongues like a fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance now let me just make a few comments and then we'll close so now look there was no Messenger to the first outpouring of the Holy Spirit every by with me Peter was a spokesperson he stood up but remember Peter was not a prophet not a prophet they were waiting on one all right had to wait for a prophet to come on the scene then what did Paul do Paul took the Old Testament by Revelation he wrote the New Testament that we live by as Christians that's right all right now Peter wrote a couple of verses or a couple of chapters but not like Paul remember he even said Paul says things we can't understand why because Peter was a born- again believer he wrote a piece of the Bible but he wasn't a prophet right he wasn't the spokesperson for that age that was coming he was a spokesperson for the age of Pentecost because remember when the Holy Ghost fell on ad30 or 33 it was like 20 something years before Paul received the Holy Ghost they had already had the Holy Ghost for all that time and then all of a sudden it struck Paul we know that watch so remember if Peter was a spokesman and that age was waiting on a prophet to come if that's the alpha bride the Omega bride has got to come the same way the Holy Ghost fell in 1906 uh Seymour and param were spokesperson but remember they were still reformers they were still trinitarians they were still believing in water baptism name father son Holy Ghost hello but what were they waiting on a prophet to come they had to wait till 1947 and brother randam comes on the scene all right everybody with me so you see each of these ages only took a dip in the Holy Spirit justification is a work sanctification is a work baptism is the Holy Spirit that's the reason it took a prophetic Prophet to come down no Messenger to the age all right so there was no Prophet no messenger there was no revealer of the word of God like God needed in Paul and brother brandham because the Holy Ghost came himself in the fullness of the baptism but at the end of the age as it always ends up so at the end of the Pentecostal age what happens brother brandham comes on the scene starts his message now 1947 all right Peter and them they got the Holy Ghost they have to wait Paul comes over and 20 something years later he gets the message he goes to the back side of the desert takes the Scrolls comes back and him and Peter are saying the same thing but Paul's got A plus Paul's a prophet he can go a little bit higher same way with all these brother R didn't deny the Holy Ghost in any of those people hello he just said you cabbage down on this you haven't went all the way way you haven't got all the fullness yet you say you latter rain people you ain't had a former Reign he was there in 47 to start the former Reign they already thought the Lord was coming in the latter rain that's how confused they were now listen God never is confused God never speaks something that's a lie right so Satan was lying to those people in their Revelation that those latter rain people were saying this is it there's no more right Satan's a lot more religious than you think he is but at the end of the age it always ends up we find the messenger sent now that's him brother brandham and all these Scruples and things are to be placed in their places what not reforming anymore restoring restoration what back to because we'll read in just a minute so now look the Alpha and Omega has to be bookends right everybody with me hey s bless you good to see you Paul was not at Pentecost everybody with me real quick Paul was not at Pentecost amen all right now but in 1 Corinthians 15:5 Paul is telling them who Jesus saw right I cut this short a little bit and that he was seen he was seen of sephus then of the 12 remember he was with the two on the Mass then he was revealed to the 12 right and that he was seen of above 500 Brethren at once I don't know where them other 380 went before Pentecost of them the greater part remain to this present but some are fallen asleep and this is Paul and after that he was seen of James then of all the apostles now watch and last of all he was seen of me also oh my as of one born out of due time or that word due time means an untimely birth what was Paul saying he said look I should have been in that Upper Room when the Holy Ghost fell I should have been there but I had an untimely birth I wasn't supposed to be born there I supposed to be born here all right now look here's your book ends brother random was not in he was born in 1909 he wasn't even born yet 1906 Isa Street brother R was not there everybody with me now watch on the Deep call to the Deep this is the one they have the they have the film of Washington DC and people right out there it's not me Christians I'm just a man chief of Sinners one born out of season he said the same thing Paul said when born out of season to you Full Gospel are Pentecostal people what was he telling them he said by Grace I'm here he said but I should have been in 190 six but no he shouldn't have really cuz he wasn't but he would have been just a reformer he had to come out and be a prophet Paul had to come out and be a prophet amen everybody with me that's right by God's grace he lets me call you brothers and sisters this is deep call to the deep in Columbia South Carolina a different place I was born out of season amongst you Full Gospel people I was a Baptist and you know more about scripture maybe than I do but I know the author real well well and I know that he's here now watch this we promised a messenger in Malachi 4 Everybody understand what Malachi 4 is right we're promised a messenger in last days Malachi 4 that would restore the faith of the children back to the fathers back to the fathers right the Pentecostal children now that's getting away from it will bring them back to the original message of the original Pentecost 8030 everybody with me all right Hallelujah I feel religious I will restore God has a provided way today it's a restored Pentecost not 1906 a restored Pentecost back to the same things the same signs the same message there you are all right let's read Malachi 4 Remember You The Law of Moses all right so don't forget the law my servant which I commanded unto you in Horeb for all Israel with the statutes and judgments behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord now remember this is Elijah Spirit number three and four everybody with me this is Elijah Spirit number three and four in this one scripture you got to have an A a revelation to know which is which everybody with me Hallelujah all right number five's coming which would be Moses and Elijah but number Spirit of Elijah number three and four one was Elijah second was Elisha third was who John the Baptist now what was John the Baptist doing he was standing between the Old Testament and coming up of the New Testament saying behold there's something coming different not a lamb coming to an altar where you kill him no there's a lamb standing here today because right there he is so he's turning the hearts of the Old Testament fathers read it all right to the New Testament children new right now then brother brandham comes and what does he do he turns the heart of that 1906 isusa Street babies they just Babble and do everything you know they had no order they just did everything brother brandham said he that they were Babylon Pentecostal babies his message is to turn those children back to the doctrine of the fathers the truth yes of the fathers all right we'll talk about there be something else there a key to that we'll talk about this afternoon so let's stand but he came to you to turn your heart of the children to their fathers yes it's okay to be a baby but grow up let's take these doctrines what brother random do he took Loose Ends he took the doctrine that was in the first three Church ages that man had tore apart remember God didn't tear it apart man tore it apart put their own ideas in it well brother random had to come and and and he didn't just start preaching a oh come on some he didn't start preaching a TR Doctrine he was sent to restore us back to the Pentecostal fathers that didn't preach that Doctrine he never baptized in the name of father son holy ghost ever he even had to ask the the Baptist preacher to baptize him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ right so he was restoring us back to where even though we can be born again again babies in the end time God can take us back to the faith of the fathers where there was what power read those read the book of Acts that brother Brown said there'll be another book of Acts you are that book of Acts yes that's right you are that time that we're supposed to come to a place to where even another thing one more thing that that brother uh the old brother the old black brother he was a minister and he said I was in the you know like 20 years old in the zoa Street he said we didn't have to come to the altar he said we were taught to receive it in our seats said we did have land on of hands we did have a Terry room which was upstairs he said but I can tell you many many of my friends that received the Holy Ghost sitting out in sitting out congregation and that's that's Bible that's getting back to the Bible where the word was being preached and the Holy Ghost fell on the people and give them the Holy Ghost sure we love emotions sure we love people laying on of hands but you don't have have to have that you don't have to have that be like the Gentile Centurion I'm of authority you're of authority I know you got Authority you ain't got to go pray for my servant just speak to him and ain't no telling how many miles that that prayer went but he said uh your servant's healed let's get back to that let's sing a song God bless you we'll be We'll add a little more to this this afternoon my heart and soul were fed by amen you have a name the abondance chains of sin oh but the great Dem of pain he set me fre free to worship him

got to accept it pardon is not a pardon until it's received as a pardon Abraham Lincoln pardoned all the slaves he wrote the Emancipation Proclamation but you know there's still some slaves that stayed slaves read your read your history not everybody went free but all when God makes an emancipation you just grab a hold of it and you go free Freedom let's don't be bound don't be bound by the world don't be bound by all this junk and stuff that's going around don't worry about what the world's doing you can't brother R said you put Abraham Lincoln and George Washington in every office in the United States and never turn around well if they can't turn it around I'll promise you them folks up there can't amen you know there's one man that can turn it around and that's God but you know what they did they turned him away why do you think Los Angeles is going to sink into the ground into the ocean that's where the outpouring of the Holy Ghost began 1906 isusa Street very short Street there in Los Angeles going toward isusa California in 1906 the Holy Ghost fell and from there started a Revival and by 1915 I'll read it to you this afternoon by 1915 the Revival was over the thing was scattered they didn't even they didn't even worry about isusa no more they were Church of God they were Church of this they were first church of this second Church of this and they just split so much till the historian says you can't tell what the original was except for history that was written down oh my brothers and sisters let's don't let this message we got be that way this is not a history lesson this is truth God sent us a prophet no doubt but we're here today to manifest what he taught read the books listen to the tapes he said in them you'll find Rapture and faith you decide whether you want to be emancipated or not if you want to stay bound that's your choice if you want to be set free God's standing right there close to set you free if you'll just accept that pardon
