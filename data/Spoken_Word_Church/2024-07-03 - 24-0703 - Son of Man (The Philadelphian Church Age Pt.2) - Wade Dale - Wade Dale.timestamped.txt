[1:51] the to the family the other day and I
[1:53] forgot my phone but this brother from
[1:56] Uganda sent brother Keith Reed a
[1:58] message and said I watched the funeral
[2:01] service he said I thought brother Dale
[2:04] was
[2:07] black he'd never seen him he' heard his
[2:10] he'd heard his CDs they got the CDs but
[2:12] they didn't have internet service until
[2:14] they went somewhere to watch it and when
[2:16] they watched it he called brother Keith
[2:17] he said I thought he was
[2:21] black well I didn't even think he talked
[2:24] black but anyway there is something if
[2:26] there is something like that but uh uh
[2:30] they had we had a chuckle because uh I
[2:33] tell you around the country there's
[2:35] there's a lot of people being impacted
[2:37] uh by Brother Dale's Ministry that we'll
[2:39] never know until we get the other side I
[2:40] was talking to talking to brother Dutch
[2:43] Scott or somebody I believe it was in
[2:44] the we'll never know do we get there how
[2:46] much even anybody's
[2:48] Ministry impacts people around the world
[2:51] not just in this little community so um
[2:54] we appreciate all the people ones coming
[2:57] man people coming in from all over we
[2:59] sure appreciate appreciate you guys
[3:00] handling it we fed a lot of people y'all
[3:02] did fed a lot of people and we
[3:04] appreciate that and
[3:06] um we want to uh keep everything moving
[3:11] we're not going to as brother Donnie we
[3:13] were talking a few minutes ago you know
[3:14] we you can't crawl up and you can't curl
[3:17] up in a corner with you with your thumb
[3:19] and your mouth and and say oh wo is
[3:22] me this is a cycle of
[3:25] Life brother Dale's job was finished our
[3:28] God would left him here
[3:30] so when it's time for us to move
[3:32] on um and and do the best we can
[3:36] until somebody's got to preach us out of
[3:39] here if it ain't me I hope I'm around
[3:41] when I hear the guy and I hope I accept
[3:43] his message the message of the hour the
[3:45] way it was preached but we still got a
[3:47] lot to do now so uh we um we're not
[3:52] going to stop we're not going to even
[3:53] pause you can't pause God don't pause he
[3:57] carries on all right and like I said
[3:59] before traged tragedy doesn't destroy a
[4:02] Christian it defines a Christian if
[4:03] you'll realize that it defined everybody
[4:06] in the Bible there's a defining moment
[4:08] in the Bible and sometimes it's not
[4:11] good job
[4:14] Jonah all the different ones look at
[4:18] Samson there's a defining moment in
[4:20] their life that they could have just
[4:21] curled up and said God I'm done but no
[4:24] they persevered enough to where God
[4:26] thought enough of them to write them in
[4:27] the Bible and and give give us an
[4:30] example to carry on so we we uh we're
[4:32] going to carry on do the best we can and
[4:35] uh we pray that you'll uh that you'll
[4:38] support us and we'll all support each
[4:40] other we have a wonderful ministry here

[5:22] here but there's a lot of people that he
[5:24] met on that other side that afternoon
[5:27] that he had preached them into that
[5:30] place of rest and I love what Brother
[5:33] Richard said he said brother Dale knew
[5:35] where to go he wasn't lost at the river
[5:38] he knew exactly where to go so I
[5:40] appreciate Brother Richard and all them

[6:04] want to go even if you don't know if you
[6:07] going yet all if you want to go put your
[6:11] name down so we can start finding some U
[6:14] motels and and stuff we'll have a good
[6:16] time um they probably do much all the
[6:19] work food and all we send them money to
[6:22] buy that cuz they're a small church and
[6:25] then we we're going to bring we're going
[6:26] to bring up there as many as they've got
[6:29] so that'll double the place up but they

[6:35] and don't brother Andre said you want to
[6:36] not do it I said why you plan on going
[6:40] somewhere else or you plan unless we go
[6:41] in a rapture we coming right we ain't
[6:44] stopping nothing I hated to call off
[6:46] service Sunday but I knew we' every one
[6:48] of us their mind our minds would be in a
[6:51] different place on Sunday after the
[6:55] service so we just kind of took off
[6:56] actually me and June took off and went
[6:57] to brother Donnie Reagan's meetings and
[6:59] had a good time up there meeting people
[7:01] we had met in a long time and uh they
[7:04] honored brother
[7:05] Dale give him my hand clap standing
[7:08] everybody was standing up that they
[7:10] announced that he had passed away and uh
[7:12] had the funeral service so we sure
[7:13] appreciate the bride around the world
[7:15] we're going to see him here in a little
[7:16] while in August we're going to have the
[7:18] uh camp meeting anybody like to go I
[7:20] think we're going to go for a day or so
[7:22] so if you'd like to go just uh um it's
[7:25] in Ruth North Carolina Ru from North nor
[7:28] North Carolina it's always second or
[7:30] first week in August full week so we a
[7:32] lot of missionaries brother Keith Reed
[7:34] will be here the week
[7:35] before and brother George uh Quinn will
[7:39] be here the week after so those two
[7:41] Sundays we'll have U ministers come like
[7:44] dad said he in August August he's a
[7:47] scheduler he's not a preacher he just
[7:49] scheduled people coming in and out you
[7:51] know so we'll see how that goes but also
[7:53] pray for brother Lise they're leaving
[7:55] Thursday going to Honduras next next
[7:59] Thursday so they'll be gone for a little
[8:01] while so pray for brother Lise if you
[8:02] got a little something to hand him and
[8:04] give him you know a few dollars here or
[8:06] there it sure would help the church is
[8:07] paying for the uh trip part of that so
[8:10] if you want to give him a little extra
[8:12] I'm sure it will go toward uh brother
[8:16] Lis is one that I can I like him and
[8:18] brother buron I can I can really uh put
[8:21] my faith in what he does with what with
[8:23] what we give him so I have have um a lot
[8:26] of faith in in what he does down there
[8:28] in the Honduras
[8:31] so man said one time if you love a
[8:34] flower don't pick it
[8:36] up because if you pick it up it
[8:39] dies and it ceases to be what you love
[8:42] so if you love a flower Let It Be Love
[8:45] is not about
[8:49] possession love is about
[8:52] appreciation amen let's bow our heads

[9:33] salvation in it cuz they people need to
[9:35] be saved Sanctified and filled with the
[9:37] Holy Ghost Lord I pray that you'd bless
[9:40] us now and keep us in Jesus name amen I
[9:44] told somebody this weekend I said I am
[9:45] expecting something to happen I don't
[9:48] know what it is but I am expecting
[9:50] something to happen brother Brian
[9:52] preached
[9:54] expectations go watch go listen to that
[9:57] if you're expecting to just you know
[9:58] this is when night and I didn't feel
[10:00] good so I ain't coming to church and
[10:02] Sunday well that's just an anniversary
[10:04] meeting and I think I'll just take my
[10:05] kids and go to the mountains you'll get
[10:08] what you expect I promise you if you're
[10:11] a true Christian you'll want to be in
[10:14] church the ones that said amen I believe
[10:17] them one of y'all that didn't I don't
[10:19] know about that so let's that's your
[10:22] confession with the
[10:24] what with your mouth all right let's
[10:27] look at we're going to talk about the
[10:29] Phil phelian Church age tonight if
[10:30] they'll pull it up on the
[10:32] screen we will uh begin to read here in
[10:36] Revelations 1:10 I was in the spirit on
[10:39] the Lord's day and heard behind me a
[10:40] great voice as of trumpet saying I am
[10:42] Alpha and Omega the first and the last
[10:44] and what thou seest write it in a book
[10:46] thank God he put it together so that we
[10:48] can have it today 2,000 years after it
[10:52] was
[10:53] written and it's accurate there's a lot
[10:56] of things been written 2,000 years ago
[10:58] not very accurate this is accurate this
[11:00] is eternal unto Ephesus Smyrna pergamus
[11:03] thara Sardis we're now in the
[11:05] Philadelphian Church age and unto Leota
[11:08] now we live in the lean age and we'll
[11:10] get to that a little bit later on and I
[11:12] turned to see the voice that spake with
[11:13] me and being turned I saw seven golden
[11:16] candlesticks and in the midst of the
[11:17] seven candlesticks one likened to the
[11:19] son of man clothed with the Garment down
[11:21] to the foot and G about the PS with a
[11:23] golden girdle you may be seated and I'll
[11:25] read this I was thinking uh when Brother
[11:27] Richard was speaking there on Saturday
[11:30] brother John there was a lot of
[11:31] different denominations sitting in that
[11:32] room and some of the denomination of
[11:35] their own self so you know so when
[11:38] brother when Brother Richard started
[11:40] talking about Son of God and the son of
[11:41] man I'm sure they probably it just
[11:44] went amen listen but we're
[11:48] required we're
[11:50] required to be under the son of man
[11:52] Ministry if you're in the end time and
[11:54] you're in the message of the hour you
[11:56] got to understand that that word is
[11:57] going to be made flesh in me and you not
[12:00] somebody else not somebody to come but
[12:02] in me and you all right if you don't
[12:04] believe that then we need to get in the
[12:05] Altar and start praying we need to go
[12:07] outside maybe in the uh in the quietness
[12:10] of the of the woods or something and
[12:11] just pray and say God I don't understand
[12:14] this show it to me and you know what if
[12:15] you got the Holy Ghost he is obligated
[12:18] to show you an answer and he's going to
[12:21] put somebody in the pull pit to give you
[12:23] that answer all right so just remember
[12:26] though that God is a dispensationalist
[12:29] and remember I was thinking
[12:31] today we're going through all these
[12:32] Church ages now we we're here in we went
[12:35] through Sardis which was what that was
[12:37] the age of
[12:39] justification all right the just shall
[12:41] live by faith your justification is you
[12:44] got to believe that God did away with
[12:47] all your past
[12:49] sins if you don't believe that you can't
[12:51] move to
[12:53] sanctification you can't believe it you
[12:55] got to be a believer to believe that he
[12:58] don't even
[12:59] he don't even know about him
[13:02] anymore amen putting the Sea of God's
[13:04] forgetfulness never to be remembered
[13:06] again but now remember that same old
[13:08] demon is still
[13:10] there he just got a black eye he's not
[13:14] dead he just got a black eye and you're
[13:17] moving on toward God and that's when
[13:19] Martin Luther said the just shall live
[13:21] by faith not Penance not works not what
[13:24] the Bible says lest any man should boast
[13:26] I did this and I did that no the just
[13:29] shall live by faith it didn't matter I
[13:31] looking at some quotes of brother
[13:33] brandham he said you know God could have
[13:35] give everything to
[13:36] cus but he gave it to a fisherman he
[13:39] couldn't even write his
[13:41] name gave Peter the keys to the kingdom
[13:45] he could have gave it to Kus but he
[13:47] didn't he could have give all these
[13:49] great things to these other great people
[13:50] but he didn't he gave it to the lowly he
[13:52] gave it to the meek he gave it to the
[13:54] ones that are that what that are that
[13:56] are open that open say hey just God give
[13:58] it to tell me whatever you got right all
[14:00] right and remember the things that they
[14:02] needed God already give it to them right
[14:05] am Gideon had that Ox goat around him
[14:08] the whole time cuz he was poking his
[14:10] cattle and whatever else around he just
[14:13] didn't know he was going to whip about
[14:14] 300 Philistines with that or whoever it
[14:16] was he got tired he got sick and tired
[14:19] of being run over are we going to be
[14:21] sick and tired of being run over by the
[14:23] devil or we just going to keep like
[14:24] brother J said Wy Wy wo just keep going
[14:26] over and over living this thing over
[14:28] again
[14:29] somewhere there's got to be a victory
[14:31] there is victory in the message of the
[14:33] hour but there's more Victory in Jesus
[14:36] Christ amen the the victory is in Jesus
[14:39] Christ and then this is just this is the
[14:41] icing on the cake right the cake is
[14:44] Jesus Christ the message is the icing on
[14:46] the cake amen Cake's pretty good but I
[14:50] like some icing on it like a lot like
[14:53] all that stuff y'all fixed this past
[14:55] weekend had to buy some new clothes
[15:00] I was allergic to it it made me
[15:03] swell that's my story or June either put
[15:07] it in the dryer too
[15:09] long but no the food I mean we're still
[15:12] eating it and we sure appreciate all
[15:13] that and it was it was if it was if if
[15:16] it wasn't good we wouldn't tell you but
[15:17] it's it was delicious it was absolutely
[15:20] delicious and we keep eating and I told
[15:22] Josh we were at my house a minute ago
[15:23] and I opened up the we have one in the
[15:25] back a refrigerator in the back with
[15:27] freezer and I it up and I said this like
[15:30] a
[15:30] restaurant we got all kind of stuff in
[15:33] them trays you know stacked on top of
[15:34] each other in the refrigerator so but
[15:37] but thank God that we had all that to
[15:39] eat and and fed all those people and and
[15:42] had some left over and we sure
[15:43] appreciate that Revelations 3:7 now
[15:45] we're going to get into Philadelphia
[15:47] Church age now that church age is
[15:49] getting really close to leosa where we
[15:53] are now this church age is going to bump
[15:55] right up against the lotan church age
[15:58] all right and we'll read when it starts
[16:00] and when it ends tonight and we won't be
[16:02] won't be too long so Revelations 3:7
[16:04] says to the angel of the Church of
[16:06] Philadelphia now who was the angel we
[16:08] know that was John Wesley all right
[16:10] we'll get to that in a second a man that
[16:12] preached
[16:14] eight I ain't going to tell you Ain no8
[16:18] 800 sermons like a month or a year or
[16:20] 800 sermons a year 4800 sermons I think
[16:23] in a stretch of time he got up at 5:00
[16:26] in the morning he slept 6 hours got up
[16:27] at 5:00 in the morning started preaching
[16:30] some of y'all do too but it might not be
[16:32] very well until the angel the church in
[16:34] Phil philadelph who all morning in
[16:37] people around here yeah that's what I
[16:38] thought
[16:39] one these things sayith he that is Holy
[16:42] he that is true he that had the Key of
[16:45] David he that openeth and no man
[16:47] shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth
[16:50] I Know Thy Works behold I have set
[16:52] before thee an open door we're going to
[16:54] see that this is one of the greatest
[16:56] missionary ages it wasn't just remember
[16:59] it was it was mainly Martin
[17:01] Luther but then Martin Luther they start
[17:04] they ma they made a print press so
[17:06] Martin Luther could put his words in on
[17:09] a paper but then what John Wesley did
[17:12] John Wesley started sending people out
[17:14] with that message the Bible was already
[17:17] put together by Luther so the print and
[17:19] presses and all these different things
[17:20] of Transportation was getting better and
[17:22] all these different things so this was
[17:24] brother R said the greatest missionary
[17:26] age it had to get the word out all right
[17:29] and remember this is the age of
[17:31] sanctification cuz if we go through just
[17:33] justification you can die and go to
[17:35] hell come on
[17:37] somebody you can go you can be
[17:39] Sanctified die and go to hell but you
[17:42] can't have the new birth and not die and
[17:43] go to hell but you got to have each one
[17:47] to get the new birth all right I know th
[17:50] works that's why that I'm spending more
[17:52] time on this Three Ages because brother
[17:55] BR said they complete the birth your
[17:56] birth is justification sanctification
[17:59] baptism of the Holy Ghost all right
[18:00] everybody with me all right no man can
[18:03] shut it for thou Hast a little strength
[18:04] now little strength and H has kept my
[18:07] word and not denied my name behold I
[18:09] will make them of the synagogue of Satan
[18:11] which say they are Jews and are not
[18:13] they're Liars but they do lie behold I
[18:15] will make them to come in worship before
[18:17] thy feet and to know that I have loved
[18:19] thee because thou Hast kept the word of
[18:21] my patience also will keep thee from the
[18:24] hour of Temptation we need that now
[18:27] which shall come upon all all the world
[18:29] now the hour of Temptation has come upon
[18:31] all the world to try them that dwell
[18:33] upon the Earth and listen I'm going to
[18:35] tell you something this is the trying
[18:37] time right you better know that you know
[18:40] that you know now remember we don't shut
[18:43] the door God opened it God shut
[18:47] it in in Noah's time Noah didn't shut
[18:50] the door God shut the door all right
[18:54] behold I come quickly and hold that fast
[18:57] which thou Hast that no man take thy
[18:59] Crown to him that overcometh will I make
[19:01] a pillar in the temple of my God and he
[19:03] shall go no more out and I will write
[19:05] upon him the name of my God and the name
[19:07] of the city of my God which is New
[19:08] Jerusalem which cometh down out of
[19:10] Heaven from my God and I will write upon
[19:12] him my new name he that hath an ear let
[19:15] him hear what the spirit says to the
[19:17] churches so we're we're in the we're in
[19:19] the age of 1 2 3 4 five six Church age
[19:23] which is Wesley we've seen Luther Luther
[19:27] is going to carry over into Wesley the
[19:29] porter for that age is Wesley he comes
[19:31] in that overlap time we'll we'll tell
[19:34] you his birth and death in a minute but
[19:35] he was born at like 1701 and died in the
[19:38] middle of that somewhere so he was right
[19:40] in the middle of that church age so some
[19:42] of that carried over brother R will
[19:43] we'll verify that and just a just a
[19:45] little bit but that we're now almost at
[19:47] the last Church age but brother Brown
[19:49] makes a statement I'll read it to you
[19:51] just a little bit later I want you to
[19:52] think in your mind he said the last
[19:53] three ages completes the birth now that
[19:56] doesn't mean they weren't born again
[19:57] back here right all right they were born
[20:00] again back here they had the new birth
[20:02] just like you do it's just it was held
[20:04] down and bound by the word that they
[20:07] held that's right okay everybody with
[20:10] me same way with me and you I mean we
[20:12] can bind it
[20:14] too even with the Holy Ghost you can
[20:17] grieve it yeah brother BR said to go out
[20:19] and go on the limb out and sit out there
[20:21] and say all right I'll come back when
[20:23] you clean up a little bit amen I'm not
[20:26] coming out of your soul because you're
[20:28] born again but you at Spirit realm you
[20:30] have been H doing some things you really
[20:32] shouldn't be doing
[20:34] amen I'm sorry that just happens to me
[20:37] if it doesn't happen to you guys that's
[20:38] okay pray for
[20:41] me one day we're going to have to cut
[20:43] that limb off y keep him from going out
[20:46] there as we keep him in US Body Spirit
[20:49] and soul all right so we got now we're
[20:52] almost in we are in the man anointing
[21:00] this is where this thing always gets
[21:03] stuck
[21:05] Jo guess what we're going to start over
[21:16] again
[21:18] Tada
[21:20] technology if I have my notes this
[21:22] wouldn't
[21:25] happen I'm like Louise you know you get
[21:27] your notes and
[21:30] I want you to watch we've been talking
[21:32] about a dominating female about the
[21:33] church I want you to know that that
[21:36] we're not talking about the female as
[21:38] far as you sisters because you type the
[21:40] bride just like we do all right but if
[21:44] you got your position you're not a
[21:46] dominating female all right you have
[21:49] your place you have your position but if
[21:51] you dominate The Man and that's what's
[21:53] been doing the the church the the female
[21:57] part of the church has been trying
[21:59] doin denominate they did but dominate
[22:01] the male which is Jesus
[22:03] Christ all right so it happened in all
[22:06] the ages but now you see we come down
[22:07] and we when we get to
[22:09] Lea Lea is a woman's age it's a woman's
[22:14] number a woman runs everything in this
[22:17] age why it's come to the
[22:20] Apex of dominating it's a dominating
[22:23] they don't want Jesus Christ listen the
[22:25] Bible tells us in the Old Testament the
[22:27] Bible says uh uh let us take your
[22:31] name seven women seven churches take
[22:34] hold of one man Jesus Christ and said
[22:36] hey let us take your name but we're not
[22:38] going to do what you tell us to do come
[22:40] on we're not going to do what you tell
[22:42] us to do we're going to have our own way
[22:44] I mean me I'll do it my way and you just
[22:46] let us call us miss
[22:49] Jesus well that's what they're doing
[22:53] Nowa but they're wretched blind
[22:55] miserable naked and don't know it
[22:58] and so are we until the Revelation comes
[23:01] of the end time message to open up the
[23:03] full entire Bible or the opening of the
[23:06] seals as we see here so remember the the
[23:08] opening of the seals we're going to get
[23:10] back to it when brother randam preaches
[23:11] them when we get into that church age
[23:15] but remember everything we've been
[23:17] talking about has been talking about a
[23:18] loosing there's something been bound but
[23:20] there's a loosing brother CLA and I were
[23:22] talking the other day you know he talk
[23:24] about those uh 200,000,000
[23:29] demons that were released into the
[23:33] world and then brother Brown said
[23:35] they're released on me and
[23:37] you what to do though not to destroy us
[23:40] but to drive us back to the Homeland cuz
[23:43] that's what happened in ikan and Hitler
[23:44] are different ones but 200,000,000
[23:46] demons that were withheld just for this
[23:49] age just for me and you but we will
[23:52] overcome amen cuz we have the word we
[23:55] have the open book The Devil can't hide
[23:58] behind the true word of God he can hide
[24:00] behind a fable he can hide behind a
[24:02] false religion that's why God hates
[24:04] false
[24:05] Doctrine cuz Satan can hide behind it
[24:07] because he's the author of anything
[24:09] false God's never the author of anything
[24:12] false he's all true everything he says
[24:14] is true he don't have to ever take it
[24:17] back praise God we don't have to make
[24:19] excuses for this message we don't have
[24:22] to make excuses for the way we live in
[24:24] this Bible amen you make excuses you
[24:27] never had an experience right
[24:30] amen
[24:31] right so let's let's not preach let's
[24:34] just go back to teaching a little bit
[24:35] here so the opening of the first three
[24:37] seals we see that there was a Ministry
[24:39] loosed a horse went out but also when
[24:42] that horse went out there was already
[24:44] someone standing there or there was a
[24:47] lion anointing already standing there
[24:50] cuz he said John come and see and then
[24:52] out goes the white horse rider right
[24:56] then we look and see that we keep on
[24:58] going that he bluffed his way through
[25:00] the the church it became a saying then a
[25:02] deed then a
[25:04] Doctrine and I go back to where James
[25:07] says when lust is conceived it brings
[25:10] forth sin when sin's
[25:12] finished it brings forth death it's
[25:15] death to begin with but we're all born
[25:17] in sin we were all we all born Sinners
[25:21] right but there's a way out if you
[25:24] continue in
[25:25] sin Paul said do we continue in sin that
[25:29] Grace May abound where just Grace covers
[25:31] everything no there's no grease in Grace
[25:33] there's no greasy Grace there is Grace
[25:36] but they're not greasy
[25:37] graay but he bluffed his way through the
[25:39] true church then we come to the next
[25:42] seal when it opened the second beast
[25:44] which is the ox it comes out and says
[25:47] hey come and see John because there's
[25:48] something coming a little bit different
[25:51] he's changed his horse or he's changed
[25:53] his power all right so the second beast
[25:56] the ox beast in the fourth Church
[25:58] age all right everybody with me fourth
[26:02] Church age was that Ox anointing of
[26:05] Labor longest Church age there was we
[26:07] just got finished with it they just
[26:09] barely had enough strength to make it
[26:11] through if they called oursel a
[26:13] Christian they died so that's why that
[26:15] horse was red and power was given and
[26:18] what happened God allowed Satan to then
[26:21] have a voice or a sword or something to
[26:23] use or a
[26:26] Doctrine see tonight and all of true
[26:28] ministers they're they're taking that
[26:29] sword and they're trying to cut that bad
[26:32] out of you they're trying to cut that
[26:34] bad out of all of
[26:36] us and then let us heal by the word of
[26:39] God cut that bad thing out that we've
[26:41] been
[26:42] doing but they should kill one another
[26:45] what a great killing 68 million
[26:47] population of California and Texas was
[26:50] obliterated by the Catholic church
[26:52] because you called yourself a
[26:54] Christian so now we are here in the next
[26:57] in the fifth Church age it starts as a
[27:00] man anointing because look the man
[27:02] anointing during that time is
[27:03] intelligence it's up here intelligence
[27:05] all right and when he had opened the
[27:07] third seal I heard the third Beast which
[27:09] was the man anointing tell John come and
[27:11] see and I beheld it was a black horse
[27:14] and he that set on him had a pair of
[27:15] balances and I Heard a Voice in the
[27:17] midst of the four beast and thank God
[27:19] for Jesus
[27:21] Christ because that's Jesus Christ
[27:23] telling us that's not the one of the
[27:25] four beasts that's not John if you'll
[27:27] read your church book brother R said
[27:29] that was Jesus Christ screaming out
[27:31] saying hey don't hurt the oil and wine
[27:35] don't hurt my people and there was
[27:37] enough hurt going
[27:38] on
[27:40] right now the black horse rider was the
[27:42] Antichrist but the one was speaking at
[27:45] that age was represented as man and
[27:47] that's the wisdom smart shrewd man
[27:49] started doing making inventions I read
[27:51] you the whole thing about it so the
[27:53] sardian church age remember it started
[27:55] out I know your works you got a name
[27:57] that you but you're dead
[28:00] right I have not found thy works perfect
[28:02] remember as we talked about
[28:05] Luther this is what brother Bown said as
[28:07] Luther crystallized the doctrine of
[28:08] justification by faith they held Works
[28:11] think about a man though one man he goes
[28:14] against the whole system it's kind of
[28:16] like Moses going against
[28:18] Egypt there's not a chance in the world
[28:21] that you would get any kind of odds in
[28:23] your favor but Moses destroyed a whole
[28:27] nation
[28:28] with a stick right and so did Luther he
[28:33] destroyed a whole Doctrine now he didn't
[28:35] kill it he heard it but he didn't kill
[28:38] it right but he heard it enough to where
[28:40] he pulled out and started reforming or
[28:43] starting the work of
[28:45] restoration in that church age number
[28:48] five and as the freed Christians
[28:51] glorified the son remember Roman
[28:53] Catholics they they just they love Mary
[28:55] if you'll just keep reading about Mary
[28:58] they they just rever Mary and they don't
[29:00] even talk about Jesus Christ how
[29:02] horrible is that now you about a
[29:03] dominating female now Mary herself was
[29:07] not not a dominating female but they've
[29:09] made her one by their
[29:11] doctrin and that's what a Doctrine does
[29:13] it makes something false seem true is
[29:16] that
[29:19] right but it's the doctrine absolutely
[29:22] Babylonians one of the son carrying The
[29:24] Mother We already covered that remember
[29:25] Martin Luther brother R said Martin
[29:27] Luther was one of the Great
[29:29] uh preachers of the time because what
[29:30] did he do he stood up against this whole
[29:33] system he stood up against every Church
[29:35] on every corner he stood up against
[29:37] every Catholicism Doctrine every time a
[29:40] priest would come he would blast
[29:43] them remember they put a head out on him
[29:45] and they would have killed him if God
[29:47] hadn't hadn't saved him they were going
[29:49] to take him out but they couldn't do it
[29:52] listen Satan can't take you out until
[29:54] God's done with you if you're a
[29:56] Christian if Brother Richard said this
[29:59] weekend if's a big
[30:00] word
[30:02] if you're a Christian you never will end
[30:06] your journey until God says I'm done
[30:08] with
[30:09] you because remember I don't know if you
[30:11] know this or not God never makes a
[30:13] mistake somebody ought to preach that
[30:15] every once in a
[30:17] while so Martin Luther stood and said
[30:19] the just shall live by faith not by
[30:23] this not by this doctrine that I'm that
[30:26] I I was a part of
[30:28] it listen if you were in a system you
[30:31] were part of it
[30:33] too you believe there was three gods or
[30:35] or Trinity you were believed in a
[30:37] different baptism I say some of you that
[30:39] went through the through the Baptist
[30:40] Church and Methodist Church and
[30:42] different ones we all had that same
[30:43] thing but we had to stand one day and
[30:45] see that true justification was that
[30:47] just shall live by faith not by that
[30:49] work that they're telling us to do so
[30:51] Martin Luther said this is what I'm
[30:53] preaching and this is what God was
[30:56] perfect listen God's always perfect but
[30:59] he was perfect in what Luther was saying
[31:02] Luther was telling them the truth now he
[31:03] had other things that were different
[31:05] that that he had a false baptism and
[31:08] different things but God winked at that
[31:10] God wasn't looking at that at that time
[31:11] he wasn't expecting Perfection at that
[31:14] time this a now this age he is expecting
[31:17] Perfection cuz we can look back to
[31:19] Luther see the mistakes he made see that
[31:22] his justification is mine and your
[31:24] justification in a baby
[31:26] form right
[31:28] and we got to have that just to get our
[31:30] journey started right not to get Born
[31:32] Again
[31:34] by for there in the righteousness of God
[31:37] is revealed from Faith to Faith that it
[31:38] is written the just shall live by faith
[31:41] for the wrath of God is revealed from
[31:43] Heaven against all ungodliness and
[31:44] unrighteousness of men who hold the
[31:46] truth and unrighteousness that's what
[31:48] Luther Luther was reading this same
[31:50] thing cuz he's the one it took it in
[31:52] Latin and put it into uh German at one
[31:55] time and then they put it into English
[31:58] right right so he was reading this and
[32:00] he said the just shall live by faith
[32:02] Galatians 3 says but that no man is
[32:04] justified by the law in the sight of God
[32:07] it is evident for the just shall live by
[32:11] faith Hebrews 10:38 now the just shall
[32:14] live by faith but if any man draw back
[32:16] my soul shall have no pleasure in him in
[32:19] other words if you draw back into that
[32:20] old thing you've been doing that old
[32:23] doctrine that you've been doing that old
[32:24] thing you've been doing in the past if
[32:26] you go back to that listen God don't go
[32:28] back now he will show you where you
[32:31] started but he's not going to keep you
[32:33] there your Journey's up here
[32:38] right but we are not of them who draw
[32:40] back into predition but of them that
[32:42] believe to the saving of the
[32:46] Soul now they were reformers they were
[32:49] not
[32:52] restorers God promised us that we would
[32:54] be restored but he had to do it with
[32:56] reformers
[32:58] because remember when Luther preached
[33:01] this I praise God every time I I read
[33:03] this brother Aaron I look over here at
[33:05] our prophet in the end time he was not a
[33:07] reformer right he didn't try to make
[33:10] them better by saying
[33:12] something no the power of God was on
[33:15] that man to take and deliver you from
[33:17] what you were up against and he
[33:20] delivered he didn't do it but God
[33:22] through him thousands and hundreds of
[33:24] thousands of people were saved filled
[33:27] with the Holy Ghost
[33:28] and healed through their Natural Body by
[33:31] that man's
[33:32] words God used that
[33:34] man amen that's right so Luther was
[33:39] against works as means of Salvation and
[33:41] baptism as means of regeneration he
[33:43] talked the mediation of Christ apart
[33:45] from man as was the original and
[33:48] Pentecostal concept because what did
[33:50] they do they had already took it and put
[33:52] it in a pope or put it in their Bishops
[33:55] or put it in their you know you do so
[33:57] many noveni and you you go confess and
[34:00] I've always said that's why the that's
[34:01] why the
[34:03] U Mafia loved to be Catholics every one
[34:06] of them's Catholic why they go to
[34:08] Convention and say look man I'm going to
[34:09] take this guy out
[34:11] tomorrow and the priest goes well bless
[34:13] you you know say 25 hell marriage and
[34:15] put about $50,000 under the table and
[34:18] you'll be
[34:19] fine
[34:21] right Le you know what we laugh they
[34:24] believed it right amen they believed it
[34:27] all the way to
[34:29] hell but thank God we've come out of
[34:33] that what stirred his heart by the Holy
[34:35] Ghost which was the little green shoot
[34:37] as we were explaining the other week the
[34:39] two little shoes that is corn it's the
[34:42] life of the Corn but it's not the full
[34:44] grain it's part of it piece of it all
[34:47] right so we're trying to get it back to
[34:49] the church at Pentecost because that
[34:52] Holy Ghost fell on Sons it fell on
[34:54] mature people that was with Jesus for
[34:56] three and A2 years
[34:58] that was a full corn of ear of corn in
[35:02] that church age the first church age but
[35:04] what happened is God had to let it die
[35:06] and go on the ground cuz he'd already
[35:08] said
[35:10] it and then you got Joel Joel would have
[35:13] never Joel would have never been brought
[35:16] into
[35:20] being the Book of Joel where it says
[35:24] what I'll pour out my spirit upon All
[35:26] Flesh but he said what I'm going to
[35:28] restore I'm going to restore everything
[35:31] back that's why brother brandom
[35:35] was restoration not
[35:38] Reformation all
[35:43] right and praise
[35:45] God we're part of
[35:49] that I love being associated with it I
[35:53] don't know about you but I was proud to
[35:56] be a a Believer to time message this
[35:58] past weekend sitting there listening to
[36:00] Brother Richard and different ones
[36:02] speaking and and uh
[36:05] Josh's friend Doug he he got out of the
[36:08] service and he told Josh he said wow I
[36:13] never seen that before well he' been to
[36:16] a funeral to where they just you know
[36:17] they you know speak or say a few words
[36:20] and play a couple of songs and and Ashes
[36:22] the ashes dust the dust and I told them
[36:26] I said you ain't going to see you he was
[36:28] surprised they it was a sermon we got a
[36:31] sermon preached to us on on on Saturday
[36:34] Brother Richard preached a sermon and we
[36:37] responded to it I mean most time you
[36:39] don't get that but you know
[36:41] what get it while you can they were
[36:44] there preach to them they can't say they
[36:47] never heard it now when you start
[36:49] talking about a body change you talk
[36:51] about taking that body and making it
[36:53] Eternal you talk about going into
[36:55] another dimension you talk about all
[36:57] those and it it's just weird to
[36:59] them but to me and you we shouted
[37:04] amen cuz we knew what he was talking
[37:06] about we knew who the scripture was
[37:09] talking about all those things right
[37:11] amen so praise God it's not it shouldn't
[37:14] make your head swell up it shouldn't
[37:15] make you you sat there with your head
[37:17] down going God why me and why not
[37:20] them
[37:26] amen but thank God God for little two
[37:28] little shoots cuz remember when you got
[37:30] born again that's all you had right you
[37:33] had two little
[37:34] shoots you were just struggling to get
[37:36] out of the ground and you had two shoots
[37:39] but you had life in you potentially you
[37:42] had the wheat cor the wheat corn the
[37:43] kernel right remember potentially but
[37:47] remember if you'll read in the Bible
[37:49] Jesus talks about the tears and all
[37:50] these different things putting the seed
[37:51] into this kind of ground that kind of
[37:53] ground you can actually you can't have
[37:55] your salvation taken away from you all
[37:57] right is everybody with me but you can
[37:59] lose the joy of it for one thing and for
[38:02] another thing if you just get Justified
[38:04] and you don't keep going on you're going
[38:06] to hell
[38:07] anyway you won't go to hell for the sins
[38:09] you did before cuz God is just that's
[38:13] why it's called justification just to
[38:15] forgive you for that because you asked
[38:17] him God I didn't mean to do that amen
[38:21] that's right forgive me Lord and he's
[38:23] just to forgive you put it away not ever
[38:26] remember it again but the next day
[38:28] there's another recording turned on
[38:31] right all
[38:34] right that's why Luther's justification
[38:37] in this age will not get you to
[38:39] heaven now if you died you understand
[38:42] deathbed confession and all this some I
[38:44] y'all I don't have to explain all this
[38:46] if you're alive
[38:47] today and you're listening to me or
[38:50] you're listening to somebody else you
[38:52] can't you can't say God I don't know any
[38:55] difference I just was justified but I'll
[38:57] be right back to doing what I was doing
[38:58] no you can't do that cuz God's going to
[39:01] hit play and he's going to play a tape
[39:03] where somebody's going to say you need
[39:05] to be Sanctified you need to be filled
[39:07] with the Holy Ghost
[39:09] amen I thank God for all the baptism
[39:12] we've had and all the different things
[39:14] but I want the Holy Ghost to come on
[39:15] people I want the Holy Ghost to be
[39:17] inside of you doing the work not just
[39:20] sitting here in a church just paying
[39:22] attention
[39:26] sometimes luk will ever forever be known
[39:28] as the instrument in the hand of God who
[39:30] revived this truth he was the fifth
[39:32] messenger and his message was the just
[39:34] shall live by faith it's been called by
[39:37] the historians the period of reformation
[39:39] that is exactly right that is what it is
[39:42] it had to be that for Martin Luther was
[39:44] a reformer not a prophet now what does a
[39:46] prophet
[39:48] do a prophet restores back what was lost
[39:53] right amen that's right amen he restores
[39:56] back what was lost all those years that
[39:58] were lost according to Joel the
[40:00] different canw and BW and all that
[40:02] brother random stood in a time to where
[40:04] he brought every bit of that back
[40:07] right he was a prophet he was not a
[40:11] reformer he was a restorer of the word
[40:13] of God he didn't bring anything
[40:16] different he was stored back what have
[40:19] been lost that's
[40:21] right then there's a a revealing of the
[40:23] Seven Seals that nobody had in till the
[40:26] end time yeah we'll get into
[40:28] that so he was not able to lead the
[40:30] church back to the whole truth as would
[40:32] a man like the Apostle Paul now remember
[40:35] you got your book ends you got
[40:37] Alpha and Omega Paul and brother
[40:41] brandham they had to have the same
[40:44] message but Paul didn't have a
[40:47] message that's what Thrills my soul Paul
[40:50] didn't have a message to turn your body
[40:52] back Paul didn't have a message he
[40:55] preached about Resurrection he preached
[40:57] about the change of the body but he knew
[40:59] he wasn't going to come to it it had to
[41:01] be in the end
[41:06] time so he was able to lead the church
[41:08] back was not able to lead him back to
[41:10] the whole truth as was a man like
[41:13] brother brandham that's why we rever him
[41:15] as a prophet behold I will send you
[41:18] Elijah the
[41:20] prophet right right not Elijah the
[41:24] whoever Elijah the prophet
[41:29] and then Elisha was a prophet
[41:32] also but we'll get into that a little
[41:34] bit later when we start into brother
[41:35] brandom Ministry we'll talk about how
[41:38] that Elisha and Elijah um came
[41:42] about Be watchful and strengthen the
[41:44] things which remain that are ready to
[41:46] die for I have not found thy works
[41:47] perfect before God in other words the
[41:50] word does not call to Restoration but
[41:52] it's called Reformation had it been a
[41:54] restoration that age would have been
[41:55] another Pentecostal age but but it
[41:57] wasn't they held on to a lot of
[41:59] different doctrines even Martin Luther
[42:01] held on to a lot of doctrines that were
[42:03] false the best that could be said of it
[42:05] strengthen that which remains that is
[42:07] ready to die there was something missing
[42:10] yes there was certainly there certainly
[42:12] was this age had justification but it
[42:15] missed sanctification now look if you
[42:18] take that now there's there's people in
[42:20] the message a long time ago not so now
[42:22] around when Dad was coming up different
[42:24] on said that that that you know Luther
[42:27] didn't have anything Wesley didn't cuz
[42:28] brother RH says right here they had
[42:30] justification but they missed
[42:33] sanctification now remember their
[42:35] justification was the new birth for
[42:37] their
[42:38] time that's right right it was time for
[42:41] full res restoration it was time to
[42:44] reform the people to at least get their
[42:46] mindset listen God's
[42:49] perfect he knows how to Lead Me And You
[42:52] from One thing to the next thing to the
[42:55] next thing and to the next thing
[42:58] and if it was different he'd have made
[43:01] it
[43:02] different you see I can understand then
[43:05] you got a
[43:08] problem cuz God wrote this so
[43:12] every every person on the face of the
[43:15] Earth can get Born Again by this right
[43:19] here if you can't you're not born again
[43:24] right but you have a chance to get born
[43:26] again get in the
[43:28] Bible if you can't understand the
[43:30] prophet's message read your
[43:32] Bible then ask God to direct you to
[43:35] where brother random give you the
[43:37] Amplified version of it come on somebody
[43:40] they didn't have this in any other age
[43:42] we've got all kind of information that
[43:44] we can get
[43:46] to on
[43:48] you I don't have one I'm not I'm not
[43:52] this it'd just be something else I'd
[43:54] mess up till I get an Apple watch
[43:57] but I see y'all sometimes you do this
[43:59] and what it is is you watch turned on
[44:00] and you got a message you're reading the
[44:02] message and on your phone on your uh
[44:05] hello somebody am I telling the truth or
[44:06] am I telling the LIE
[44:08] hello thank you you don't have to do
[44:11] this when the phone goes off you do that
[44:12] when your arm goes
[44:14] off and you start reading the text and
[44:16] you're doing this you know anyway but we
[44:19] have this information so why not use the
[44:20] information for God instead of for the
[44:22] devil
[44:24] amen all right
[44:27] that's the reason there's a church it's
[44:29] the temple of God filled with God even
[44:31] the Holy Ghost The Same Spirit that was
[44:33] in Jesus while he was here on Earth
[44:36] causing him to do the mighty Works which
[44:38] he did came back on the church at
[44:40] Pentecost he couldn't be
[44:42] different but what happened at Pentecost
[44:44] after Pentecost man started getting
[44:47] their own ideas in it and just tore the
[44:49] word
[44:50] apart amen so there had to be a start of
[44:54] re Reformation to ease e us
[44:58] out EAS us into
[45:00] sanctification EAS us into the new birth
[45:04] all right everybody with me listen or
[45:06] God would have done it another way we've
[45:09] got to depend from about a month or two
[45:11] ago I said you just got to depend on
[45:13] what God said if you can't depend on
[45:16] what God Said who else you going to
[45:17] depend on let me have his name number
[45:20] and let me have his website and his
[45:22] email address I'd like to talk to that
[45:25] person but nobody but God has all the
[45:34] answers this age did not have those
[45:36] words oh they had the written word but
[45:38] not the revealed word that was the
[45:40] Reformation period but fear not little F
[45:43] flock what he say I'm going to
[45:45] restore and this reform was going to be
[45:48] the start of
[45:50] it he was going to according to his
[45:52] promise take the church back from the
[45:54] depths of Satan in the dark ages to the
[45:57] the depths of God that they had at
[45:58] Pentecost now who you talking about he
[45:59] talking about his age in the first few
[46:02] years of existence of the
[46:04] church so you know you know what the
[46:06] meaning of not perfect is it's
[46:08] unfulfilled this age was an
[46:11] unfulfilled age why they didn't have
[46:13] enough word to do this right
[46:16] here and I heard another voice from
[46:18] Heaven saying come out of her church
[46:21] come out of her my people if you hear
[46:24] his voice you will come out if you're
[46:27] his people not everybody is his
[46:31] people you got to know that you know
[46:33] that you know that you're that
[46:35] person that you be not partakers of her
[46:39] sin at that point in time he's really
[46:41] not worried about
[46:43] yours he's worried about what you coming
[46:45] out
[46:46] of God forgive me for thinking like that
[46:50] forgive me if you ever like Brother D
[46:52] said many times before if you ever thank
[46:53] God for what you
[46:55] got that he's took you out a false
[46:57] doctrine that other people are sitting
[46:58] in it right and they're what they're
[47:01] giving their life for it
[47:03] right for her sin reached into heaven
[47:07] and God hath remembered her iniquity
[47:09] remember God hates yes God hates God
[47:13] hates false
[47:14] Doctrine he's nowhere around it he can't
[47:17] stand it he hates niotis he hates
[47:20] denominations he hates all that
[47:23] stuff but he loves his bride amen
[47:28] he loves the part of the word that we
[47:30] are now the holy spirit's been bound by
[47:33] the denominations all these 2,000 years
[47:35] we find out notice the Sabbath seven
[47:37] sabbaths they couldn't get all the way
[47:39] out now we'll explain this a little bit
[47:41] more when we get into the the part where
[47:43] brother Brian brings a message because
[47:46] as we been as we've been talking we're
[47:48] sitting here today in a loud of CNA is
[47:49] everybody all right with that we're
[47:51] sitting here
[47:53] lazy I don't want to say the word
[47:57] fat
[47:58] but we have need of
[48:01] nothing think about
[48:04] that I pulled up in a car that was worth
[48:07] more than the first two houses I had
[48:09] bought when we and June got me and June
[48:10] got
[48:12] married so we're
[48:14] hurting yeah
[48:16] right but the holy spirit's been bound
[48:19] by the what by the denominations for
[48:21] 2,000 years and we notice the Sabbath
[48:25] now what was seven Sabbath seven
[48:27] sabbaths every seventh Sabbath there was
[48:29] a release right so Paul comes up he is
[48:33] in one part of the church AG there was a
[48:35] release but you couldn't go all the way
[48:38] cuz it was only
[48:39] seven but the Bible according to Luke I
[48:42] me according to Leviticus 258 you got to
[48:45] have seven of those sabbaths seven of
[48:48] those
[48:50] sabbaths seven of those Church
[48:54] ages to have your golden Jubilee that's
[48:58] right cuz if you stay in sevens 7 time 7
[49:01] is 49 so 49 is not the golden
[49:06] jubilee you and I when you got born
[49:08] again you entered into that golden
[49:11] jubilee by the soul that's right but you
[49:14] got to realize that what you got in your
[49:16] soul today is what's going to take you
[49:18] out of here it's what's going to take
[49:20] you either in another dimension if you
[49:22] need to go or it's going to change your
[49:24] body right here amen
[49:27] that's right but they couldn't get all
[49:28] the way out in other words they didn't
[49:29] have enough word to get everything out
[49:31] of that
[49:34] denomination same way with John
[49:37] Wesley I'll read you a quote here in
[49:39] just a
[49:40] minute he was
[49:42] scared that when he died they'd make a
[49:45] denomination out of what he had he was
[49:47] scared now we know brother Ram said
[49:49] every time they died they denominated
[49:51] Martin Luther before he died I mean John
[49:53] Wesley before he died he said I am
[49:55] afraid they're going to make this a
[49:58] denomination scared him to death is what
[50:00] they
[50:01] said so I will restore so the first
[50:04] three ages had the pure word of God all
[50:08] right Satan was still there but the
[50:10] power of the word took over then in the
[50:13] fourth CH Church age it went into the
[50:15] ground it actually died they killed them
[50:17] 68 million of
[50:19] them but according to John 12 if it
[50:22] didn't go in the ground the son of man
[50:25] wouldn't be able to come back in the end
[50:26] time that's
[50:28] right so thank God you this is kind of
[50:31] weird thank God for those Martyrs they
[50:33] had to go in the ground they had to give
[50:35] their life for the gospel they had to do
[50:38] it because me and you are standing right
[50:40] here now right
[50:43] amen cuz when is the son of man
[50:45] glorified in the end
[50:47] time but that son of man before Paul
[50:50] comes on the scene the son of man was
[50:53] standing on the Earth right right he had
[50:57] to go in the ground and die
[50:59] literally come back to life and then he
[51:03] poured himself out in the church ages or
[51:05] poured itself out in the first three
[51:06] ages and then it began began to what the
[51:09] worms the four worms started eating it
[51:11] down right by denominational
[51:15] ideas and then what happened I will
[51:19] restore to you the years that the and
[51:22] let me say this false Doctrine eight in
[51:24] the church ages
[51:27] the false Shepherds the false teaching
[51:30] the false churches they eat away at the
[51:32] word of
[51:34] God my great Army i s among you and you
[51:36] shall eat in plenty and be satisfied
[51:38] look when all this restoration this is
[51:39] what we're getting and praise the name
[51:41] of the Lord your God that have dealt
[51:43] wondrously with you and my people shall
[51:46] never be ashamed if you are listen if
[51:48] you're ashamed of this gospel you need
[51:50] to get born
[51:51] again if you're ashamed to walk in
[51:54] Walmart with your his clothes
[51:58] on brother Chris long I hope he's not
[52:02] watching but he'll be here tomorrow he's
[52:04] coming in early he's said Brother Jules
[52:06] preaching tonight but he told me he said
[52:10] you know he went with us when we went on
[52:11] that um fishing trip and stayed in
[52:14] Helen he said I'm going to take Joanna
[52:17] tomorrow and let her look around in
[52:19] Helen it's going to be
[52:22] 99° some of y'all that's been there I
[52:26] told I told brother Chris I said you
[52:27] better put you on some
[52:30] sunglasses cuz I'll promise you you
[52:33] going to probably see 10,000 people and
[52:36] they ain't going to be clothed as much
[52:38] as sister
[52:40] Joanna about as much material she got on
[52:43] it' be 10,000 that don't have them on
[52:45] but that's the world and they don't mind
[52:47] they just go do whatever they want to do
[52:48] and it doesn't matter to them it doesn't
[52:50] bother
[52:52] them it don't bother you know you know
[52:54] the old man going
[52:57] the river going down the
[52:59] river but he just wanted to show her
[53:02] actually you know why he's going you
[53:03] know the do y'all know the movie have
[53:05] you ever seen the movie I'll climb the
[53:07] highest
[53:08] mountain Google
[53:11] it GE I thought y'all was some man do
[53:15] anybody know what I'm talking
[53:17] about come
[53:20] on it's a good black and white movie
[53:23] ain't got no cussing in it ain't got no
[53:25] fussing in it it's 100 years old but
[53:28] they made it in
[53:29] Helen the church the white church is
[53:32] that one right up there at Robert toown
[53:34] sitting right there where all the um
[53:37] where the zip line and all that is that
[53:39] white church is the church that that guy
[53:41] pastored what it was is I think his son
[53:43] died or something if you go back to nor
[53:45] M the gr mail right there on the side of
[53:47] the road where the water comes down
[53:48] that's where the little boy
[53:50] drowns so
[53:52] anyway praise the Lord
[54:00] some
[54:02] people I'll guarantee you you'll know
[54:04] what superhero was on the movies about a
[54:06] month or two ago but you don't know
[54:08] about to climb the highest
[54:10] mountain but it's about a minister
[54:12] coming and then that's all it's all
[54:13] filmed in Helen and it was filmed
[54:15] probably back in the
[54:17] 50s but anyway he wanted to take Joan
[54:19] and show him show her because they'd
[54:21] watched the movie praise the Lord
[54:23] somebody did
[54:27] I mean it probably wasn't a top 10 but
[54:30] it was a movie made up
[54:32] there and it had some religious
[54:35] connotations it was a minister and his
[54:36] wife and you know going up there to a
[54:38] country church and and just watch it
[54:41] it'll be okay y'all watch something else
[54:43] color ain't got people ain't got no
[54:44] clothes on but you want to watch his in
[54:46] black and
[54:47] white myet said I will make up to you
[54:50] the years God says I'm I God said I've
[54:53] not wasted it You' wasted it right
[54:56] you've wasted those years but I'm going
[54:58] to be gracious and make them up for
[55:01] you I'm going to make them up to
[55:05] you The New American Bible says and I
[55:07] will repay you for the
[55:10] years but he had to wait and stop now
[55:14] God don't stop we know that but the word
[55:16] had to stop him enough to where that
[55:19] could go in the ground and die so it
[55:23] could come back up and what bring forth
[55:25] much fruit so in the end time the son of
[55:27] man's got to come back just like he was
[55:29] over here so it had to come the same way
[55:32] that's
[55:35] right now remember Ezekiel 47 we see
[55:38] that Luther now we see we have enough we
[55:42] have enough of his writings and and
[55:44] Wesley's writings they preached a
[55:46] progressive revelation that's why I
[55:49] thank God and I know all the other
[55:50] ministers like Brother Richard and and
[55:52] brother excuse me brother
[55:54] Harris that's what dad was known
[55:58] for sure he was known for being
[56:00] intellect but and all those other bad
[56:01] things but it's just people didn't
[56:03] understand him you know why they were
[56:08] lazy they preach hair and dress and God
[56:10] sent a prophet that's all there was more
[56:13] to that he read Ezekiel Lord progressive
[56:16] revelation ankles we love ankle deep
[56:18] water but you can't do a lot with
[56:21] it then you got water to the knees then
[56:24] you got water to the loins
[56:26] crustification
[56:27] sanctification loins the baptism of the
[56:29] Holy Ghost that's where the reproduction
[56:32] is everybody with me then The Headstone
[56:35] comes the water was where you can swim
[56:37] in it that's what we need we need so
[56:40] much Revelation till it'll almost drown
[56:43] you if you don't want it then I'm sorry
[56:46] you're in the wrong
[56:48] place but my dad preached the
[56:50] progressive revelation and he preached
[56:52] where Brother Richard could see it and
[56:53] all the different ones that listen to
[56:54] him and all the thousand thousands that
[56:56] he'll never know that hurt him over
[56:59] overseas but it's a progressive
[57:01] revelation that real listen I'm going to
[57:03] say this whether you like it or not real
[57:05] true genuine Born Again end time
[57:08] Believers lives on progressive
[57:10] revelation you can be Sanctified and
[57:13] just have a glory brother brand brother
[57:15] brand brother brandom and die and go to
[57:18] hell but you listen you can't have
[57:21] Progressive true progressive revelation
[57:25] and it not be of God
[57:26] right amen and you not be of God he's
[57:30] not going to waste his Revelation on the
[57:32] devil's
[57:36] kids right well you get quiet if you
[57:37] want
[57:38] to but it's the truth anyhow I stand
[57:42] here today on the foundation that we've
[57:44] got to move that we've got to progress
[57:47] that we've got to do like brother Dale
[57:48] in that in that um Vision that he had
[57:52] helping the people up get them in get
[57:53] them up into the what in the astronaut
[57:55] age
[57:57] get them up where we can get out of here
[57:58] cuz that Spates shift left right and we
[58:01] were in
[58:03] it we're going to get out of here
[58:05] whether you like it or
[58:07] not I like it I'm 64 I like it a lot
[58:11] more than I did when I was
[58:17] 54 but the fifth age all right it went
[58:21] the ground in the fourth age fifth age
[58:24] what happened two little shoots come up
[58:27] it was a true
[58:28] message remember God don't have
[58:31] faults but Luther had only enough to get
[58:34] the the life of those two shoots up out
[58:36] of the ground all right God was happy
[58:38] and pleased with that he loved it CU if
[58:41] you didn't have them two and the
[58:43] photosynthesis and the what the growth
[58:46] if that seed would have stayed in the
[58:49] ground Jesus told us if it stayed in the
[58:51] ground and died it abide
[58:54] alone but if it comes forth it'll bring
[58:56] forth what Luther Wesley Pentecost and
[59:00] then you people that are sitting here
[59:02] today am but they couldn't get all the
[59:04] way out they listen they drug some
[59:06] baggage with
[59:08] them they drug some ideas that were not
[59:11] God's revelation right but God winked at
[59:14] that and said okay that's all right cuz
[59:16] every age I'm going to shed that
[59:19] off I'm going to shed it off right I'm
[59:23] going to get my people HED as brother
[59:25] ROM said
[59:26] the honing age is now the honing age was
[59:30] not Luther's age not Wesley's age not
[59:32] Pentecost age it's this age you say what
[59:36] age you talking about I'm talking about
[59:37] the bride age I'm talking about that 50
[59:40] getting us out of the church
[59:43] ages if you got a church age mentality
[59:46] you're going to
[59:47] die
[59:50] spiritually we got to move
[59:53] up now brother Brown tells us on to
[59:55] stard E in church AG now the three
[59:56] elements that worked in those three
[59:58] Church ages three elements what
[59:59] justification sanctification baptism
[1:00:01] Holy Ghost that's what it takes to
[1:00:03] constitute the full birth that's why me
[1:00:05] and you are standing here today we
[1:00:07] constitute the full
[1:00:09] birth we are the wheat at the end of the
[1:00:15] plant well if I don't excite you then
[1:00:18] you need to find something to excite you
[1:00:20] then get a shot of something
[1:00:28] well you get happy at ball
[1:00:30] game you get happy when you see a friend
[1:00:32] you had seen for a long time well maybe
[1:00:34] not but you do if you like them a
[1:00:36] lot we get excited about a lot of things
[1:00:39] but when you preach the word of God it's
[1:00:40] just they just sit
[1:00:42] there there's something inside of you
[1:00:44] ought to boil
[1:00:46] up and at least go
[1:00:49] amen
[1:00:51] right do you know what amen does Amen
[1:00:54] breaks the airwaves and pushes it back
[1:00:56] toward
[1:00:59] me but if not then you're just sucking
[1:01:02] air back that
[1:01:03] way but when you say Amen you have you
[1:01:05] are you are expand you're pushing out
[1:01:09] some some what some some air with an
[1:01:13] amen behind it an amen means so be it I
[1:01:17] believe what you're
[1:01:19] saying I believe what you're
[1:01:23] saying that's what it takes to
[1:01:25] constitute full birth they were only
[1:01:27] conceived as a little germ in the womb
[1:01:29] of the mother that's right the holy
[1:01:30] ghost coming to
[1:01:33] birth the last three Church ages
[1:01:36] forms the complete birth all right now
[1:01:40] not that they listen not that they
[1:01:42] didn't have the complete birth over
[1:01:44] here but Luther had justification he
[1:01:47] smoked a pipe and drank a beer now some
[1:01:49] things you you think boy that's kind of
[1:01:50] evil it's really it is now but back then
[1:01:53] he was a German Germans even now drank
[1:01:55] beer like we drink
[1:01:56] tea right but he SM he didn't have
[1:01:59] anything to carry him further he just
[1:02:02] honed in on the just shall live by faith
[1:02:04] get out of that
[1:02:06] system and I'm sure if you heard him
[1:02:08] preach he probably preached in
[1:02:10] Revelations come out of her my people
[1:02:13] but pieces of that stayed in him not in
[1:02:15] his
[1:02:17] soul right but in his Spirit realm Satan
[1:02:20] was still
[1:02:21] riding come on Satan was still riding
[1:02:24] that Dark Horse
[1:02:26] sorry that's why it had to be exposed in
[1:02:28] the end time where it was coming from
[1:02:31] who it was and what's going
[1:02:33] on that's right anything contrary to the
[1:02:35] word of God is the devil there's no
[1:02:38] second person or third
[1:02:41] person
[1:02:43] right let's skip some of this so
[1:02:46] justification is the outer court and
[1:02:49] remember what about the outer court now
[1:02:51] look the outer court if you look at it
[1:02:54] when you go out the door and turn to the
[1:02:55] left you'll see the the uh situation of
[1:02:58] the Tabernacle the outer Court was just
[1:03:00] walls up but it was no cover over it if
[1:03:03] it was dark it was dark if it was
[1:03:06] raining it was raining if it was 99
[1:03:08] degrees it was 99 degrees right that's
[1:03:12] the way justification is but you got to
[1:03:14] push your come on people you got to push
[1:03:16] your way into the next realm you got to
[1:03:18] push your way into sanctification you
[1:03:21] got to push yourself into the new birth
[1:03:23] you got to walk from one to the other to
[1:03:25] the other
[1:03:26] when you get in that second realm which
[1:03:28] is the the the realm of sanctification
[1:03:30] you do have a cover over you but
[1:03:33] remember the light is still
[1:03:36] artificial the light is still
[1:03:39] candles it can go
[1:03:42] out but you're closer to
[1:03:46] God right you don't have to worry about
[1:03:49] the sun and the moon and the stars and
[1:03:52] the sky you're inside of a place that
[1:03:54] just you and a few other priest can go
[1:03:56] in and
[1:03:57] out but remember you got to go on back
[1:04:00] to the next one where it's just you and
[1:04:02] God by yourself right you and God alone
[1:04:06] nobody else not your preacher not
[1:04:08] brother
[1:04:09] brandham you got to go back there byy
[1:04:12] yourself that's why I want to caution
[1:04:14] you do not ever put your experience on
[1:04:18] somebody
[1:04:20] else's right well brother D had it
[1:04:23] that's fine I need it
[1:04:27] amen right I don't get it cuz he's got
[1:04:31] it
[1:04:32] am what I said many times I've seen many
[1:04:35] many many times in the message when a
[1:04:37] pastor dies or a pastor moves somewhere
[1:04:39] else a lot of the people leave or they
[1:04:42] get cold why there Holy Ghost left amen
[1:04:46] I'm going to preach anyway I'm standing
[1:04:48] here your Holy Ghost left you put so
[1:04:51] much on that person you know what God
[1:04:52] will do he'll take that person out of
[1:04:53] the way that's right amen
[1:04:56] God does not share his glory with
[1:04:59] nobody I put my trust in Jesus Christ
[1:05:04] through a Ministry that we are sinting
[1:05:06] under that we're going to continue under
[1:05:09] as long as I'm here we're going to
[1:05:11] continue under that but don't you ever
[1:05:13] put your faith in
[1:05:15] me you put your faith in us both
[1:05:18] contacting God
[1:05:20] together everybody with me contacting
[1:05:22] God together yeah put your faith in that
[1:05:27] cuz I'll fail you I promise you I I'm a
[1:05:30] human but God will never fail as long as
[1:05:33] I tell you the truth Chris Long said you
[1:05:34] preach the word of God and they can't
[1:05:36] they can't they can but they can't talk
[1:05:39] about you not preaching the word of God
[1:05:42] CU you know if I'm over here doing
[1:05:45] something
[1:05:46] else not bad but I mean something you
[1:05:48] don't like remember we all got things we
[1:05:51] don't like but right here is where the
[1:05:53] sacred comes right amen that's right I
[1:05:57] stand in the holy of
[1:05:59] holies before you get
[1:06:02] there but don't put your sights on me to
[1:06:05] get you back
[1:06:06] there now through us through the
[1:06:09] ministry we'll get somewhere but don't
[1:06:11] ever put your put your holy ghost on a
[1:06:13] person except Jesus Christ if you'll put
[1:06:17] your it doesn't matter cuz you know what
[1:06:19] God's going to shake this thing and he's
[1:06:21] already shaking it he's going to shake
[1:06:23] us he's going to do as the old man said
[1:06:25] he's going to sh shake you in the liver
[1:06:27] he going to make your liver Shake that's
[1:06:29] right he's going to shake this thing to
[1:06:30] find out who's in and who's
[1:06:34] out
[1:06:36] right but don't put your confidence in
[1:06:38] anybody but Jesus Christ amen you can
[1:06:41] put your confidence in a fivefold
[1:06:42] Ministry but that's fivefolds that's a
[1:06:45] team we're working as a team together
[1:06:47] and you're working as a team together
[1:06:48] you have a Ministry just like I do all
[1:06:51] right I've got to do the first thing
[1:06:52] though I got to take of the first fruits
[1:06:54] and give it out to you but the what do
[1:06:55] you do with it well that's fine that's
[1:06:57] great brother Wayne you got it I know
[1:07:00] you got
[1:07:01] it no you
[1:07:05] don't I can be the biggest deceiver
[1:07:07] standing here today you ever see in your
[1:07:11] life but you better be able to discern
[1:07:14] it you better be able to discern whether
[1:07:16] I am or
[1:07:19] not that's what I put my faith in when I
[1:07:22] sit under brother Dale's Ministry I'm
[1:07:23] looking at me to make sure I'm right and
[1:07:26] that I can receive what God has through
[1:07:29] a person we're only vessels we're only
[1:07:31] somebody God
[1:07:32] uses and when he's finished with us he
[1:07:34] takes us out of the
[1:07:36] way but until that we're still going to
[1:07:39] fight we're going to fight with
[1:07:40] everything we got there's many people
[1:07:43] today that's never went any further than
[1:07:44] the outer
[1:07:46] Court what they depend on something else
[1:07:50] right yet they are Christians oh brother
[1:07:53] brandom be careful I'm telling you what
[1:07:55] he said by the millions what the
[1:08:00] confession Bible says confess with your
[1:08:02] mouth believe in your heart that Jesus
[1:08:03] Christ has come to save you then you'll
[1:08:05] be saved all right believe that John
[1:08:07] 3:16 that's baby baby justification but
[1:08:11] if you continue to walk further you got
[1:08:13] to have another experience called
[1:08:17] sanctification cuz you can't go meet God
[1:08:19] as an unclean vessel
[1:08:23] amen that's why we got to get into John
[1:08:26] Wesley to where he
[1:08:28] preached all the
[1:08:30] time
[1:08:32] sanctification right he was an
[1:08:36] Englishman he come to the fact that hey
[1:08:38] dude y'all can sit there and drink tea
[1:08:40] all day if you want to it has no value
[1:08:42] to it at all you know what he was saying
[1:08:45] you're wasting your time sitting having
[1:08:47] a tea party when you ought to be at
[1:08:48] church listen to the word of God I say
[1:08:51] the same thing my people don't come to
[1:08:54] church half the time they got all all
[1:08:55] the other things they got to do if you
[1:08:57] become a real good Christian I promise
[1:08:58] you you won't have
[1:09:00] to I'm
[1:09:02] sorry why do why do we why do we we
[1:09:07] strive to come to church and others
[1:09:10] don't
[1:09:12] why there's something different amen God
[1:09:16] don't make
[1:09:19] exceptions well you can get quiet if you
[1:09:21] want to right but it's a truth that's
[1:09:24] right they enjy look watch they enjoy
[1:09:28] Christ in an outward
[1:09:30] form
[1:09:32] amen good preaching brother but go home
[1:09:35] and don't live
[1:09:36] it they go to church with a consolation
[1:09:39] of knowing they belong to spoken word
[1:09:43] church but they have never become hid
[1:09:45] away with him in the inner
[1:09:48] Court I'm just reading you the meage
[1:09:50] what the message said brother Ram's
[1:09:52] telling
[1:09:52] us brother Ram said in the hidden life
[1:09:55] he said you got sunlight some days are
[1:09:58] cloudy some days the sun don't shine at
[1:10:00] all some days it's dark now that's in
[1:10:02] the outer court but remember as brother
[1:10:05] Brown always said don't take sunny days
[1:10:08] as God's approval of what you're
[1:10:10] doing but also don't take the dark
[1:10:12] dreary days that God's left you CU he'll
[1:10:15] never leave you you may leave him but
[1:10:18] he'll never leave
[1:10:19] you so we read the Philadelphia and
[1:10:21] church AG watch a couple of points here
[1:10:23] and then we'll get to Martin Luther
[1:10:24] we'll be done
[1:10:26] I'm John Wesley he that hath the Key of
[1:10:29] David now watch he that openeth and no
[1:10:31] man shutteth and shutteth and no man
[1:10:33] openeth I Know Thy Works behold I have
[1:10:35] set before thee an open door now that
[1:10:37] wasn't true in the fifth Church age this
[1:10:39] is the sixth Church ages this is the
[1:10:41] Philadelphian Church age this is going
[1:10:43] to be the age that Livingston David
[1:10:45] Livingston you've you read about Stanley
[1:10:47] and Livingston well David Livingston was
[1:10:49] a really great great great missionary I
[1:10:52] think he got killed over there too
[1:10:53] didn't he a didn't get killed over in
[1:10:55] Africa doing work or wherever it was
[1:10:57] India he got killed somewhere doing work
[1:11:00] but anyway it was a great missionary age
[1:11:01] you see all these other different things
[1:11:02] Calvin swingley you hear these names D
[1:11:05] Moody and all the names that you hear
[1:11:07] they were of
[1:11:09] God but some of them were still in the
[1:11:11] re Reformation though they weren't in
[1:11:13] the restoration they were in the
[1:11:15] Reformation if Moody was a trinitarian
[1:11:18] he wasn't a
[1:11:19] restorer now he might be a great man of
[1:11:21] God for his time do you hear me brother
[1:11:24] R said Moody said Millions to heaven so
[1:11:26] I'll say he'll probably be there
[1:11:28] too but he didn't have a restoring
[1:11:31] message he had a reforming message
[1:11:34] that's why brother R had to come but
[1:11:35] they they were stacked up and brother
[1:11:37] Ram just stood right there on top of
[1:11:39] them he said I I preach what Paul
[1:11:41] preached he said I didn't preach what
[1:11:43] dght Moody preached he kept referring to
[1:11:45] I preach what Paul preached I preach
[1:11:47] what Paul
[1:11:48] preached he gave honor to all those
[1:11:50] other ones but he was a restoring
[1:11:53] Prophet to restore us back to the fa
[1:11:55] faith of the
[1:11:57] fathers for thou Hast a little strength
[1:11:59] and H has kept my word and Hast not
[1:12:01] denied my name behold I will make of
[1:12:03] them the of them the synagogue of Satan
[1:12:06] we'll talk about that maybe a little bit
[1:12:07] later so we'll continue on down I want
[1:12:08] to get to this right here the AG
[1:12:11] starting 1750 to
[1:12:13] 1906 and that Philadelphia actually
[1:12:15] means love of Brethren or brotherly love
[1:12:19] all right Revelations 3:8 I Know Thy
[1:12:22] works now watch behold I have set before
[1:12:24] thee an Open Door so in other words
[1:12:25] there's a door open now
[1:12:28] look that's an open door to the
[1:12:32] missionary that's not an open door to
[1:12:35] the
[1:12:36] seals the seals didn't open under Martin
[1:12:39] Luther I mean John
[1:12:40] Wesley so it was an open door for the
[1:12:43] people to get the Salvation message of
[1:12:46] Jesus Christ to the
[1:12:48] world and no man can shut it for thou
[1:12:50] Hast a little strength and has has kept
[1:12:51] my name it didn't say it was full
[1:12:52] strength had a little strength and
[1:12:54] that's not denied my name a little
[1:12:56] strength listen this was still an
[1:12:58] unfulfilled
[1:13:01] age Martin Luther was John Wesley was an
[1:13:03] unfulfilled age Pentecost was an
[1:13:05] unfulfilled age this age right here is
[1:13:07] the only age if you've called out of it
[1:13:10] there going to be a very
[1:13:12] filled fulfilled age all right now
[1:13:16] listen the first phrase of this verse I
[1:13:18] know that works is analyzed in the rest
[1:13:20] of the verse for The Works had to do
[1:13:22] with the open door little strength word
[1:13:24] in the name
[1:13:25] in order to understand the wealth of the
[1:13:27] meaning involved and behold I set before
[1:13:28] the open door and no man can shut it we
[1:13:31] must now recall what has been said about
[1:13:33] each age running over into another he's
[1:13:36] talking about the lap over we've been
[1:13:37] talking about this for a long time there
[1:13:39] is an overlap a melting are Fading Into
[1:13:42] rather than an Abrupt end and a
[1:13:44] clear-cut start this age particularly
[1:13:47] flows into the next age and not only
[1:13:50] does that age overflow into the last age
[1:13:52] talking about our age you know why it
[1:13:54] had to we need
[1:13:57] sanctification we need John Wesley's
[1:14:02] sanctification the seventh age a very
[1:14:04] short age gathers up into itself for one
[1:14:07] quick work all the evil of every age and
[1:14:10] all the reality though of Pentecost once
[1:14:13] the Philadelphian age has about run its
[1:14:15] course the lot ofan age quickly comes in
[1:14:18] bringing forth both the tears and wheat
[1:14:21] to harvest you can't bring it to harvest
[1:14:23] like this
[1:14:25] right that's Luther you can't bring
[1:14:27] bring it to harvest as as as
[1:14:30] Wesley the shot are coming up you can't
[1:14:34] do it as a
[1:14:36] shuck shuck just covers or or covers
[1:14:39] over the real
[1:14:41] wheat you and I are the real wheat but
[1:14:44] Pentecost was the cover we'll get into
[1:14:46] that a little bit later because there is
[1:14:47] a Pentecost L just like it was in Paul's
[1:14:50] age there's going to be one in this age
[1:14:52] all right real quick remember please
[1:14:53] that the sard Ean age started the
[1:14:55] Reformation that must still go on until
[1:14:58] the grain that was planted at Pentecost
[1:15:00] goes through the full cycle of planting
[1:15:02] watering nourishing until it comes right
[1:15:04] back to an original seed while this is
[1:15:07] going on the tears that were sown will
[1:15:09] have to go through their cycle too
[1:15:11] listen brother ROM come and preached the
[1:15:13] powerfulest message since Jesus Christ
[1:15:15] does everybody agree with
[1:15:16] that the most powerful message ever been
[1:15:19] preached since Jesus Christ he didn't
[1:15:22] destroy one
[1:15:23] denomination that was 900 and something
[1:15:26] when he's preaching there 13,000 now
[1:15:30] amen but he got into a heart of a group
[1:15:33] of people sir that's what he was looking
[1:15:35] for he wasn't looking for a great big
[1:15:37] church on the side of the road a big
[1:15:39] denominational church he was looking for
[1:15:41] individual people
[1:15:43] right I want you to see something here
[1:15:45] God works in threes doesn't he it was in
[1:15:47] the third or pergami and age that the
[1:15:49] church was married to the state now he
[1:15:51] went way back to the third age that the
[1:15:53] church was married to the state
[1:15:55] the Deeds of the nicians had become the
[1:15:57] doctrine of the nicians that age was the
[1:15:59] open door for the false
[1:16:02] fine okay once it was backed up by the
[1:16:05] power of the state it became actually a
[1:16:07] world system even though it bore the
[1:16:09] name Christian thus it spread like
[1:16:12] wildfire but now Three Ages later now
[1:16:15] that was the third age fourth fifth
[1:16:17] sixth everybody with me brother 1 2 3 4
[1:16:19] 5 6 we're going to see an open door for
[1:16:22] the
[1:16:23] truth now listen brother brandom walked
[1:16:26] through that
[1:16:29] door amen remember the Bible says he op
[1:16:33] and nobody can shut
[1:16:35] it so once the true word was open they
[1:16:37] had a little bit of it but brother Ram
[1:16:40] walked that's why he said you got to
[1:16:42] have Luther s justification you got to
[1:16:44] have Wesley sanctification you got to
[1:16:46] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost as
[1:16:48] the Pentecostal had it
[1:16:51] right we can't have furtherance of the
[1:16:54] word without about that that four stage
[1:16:57] has got to be the culmination of those
[1:17:00] three
[1:17:05] plus somebody say Amen you didn't
[1:17:08] understand that I'll explain it to you
[1:17:11] again four bugs eat it right four bugs
[1:17:16] according to Joel I can't remember them
[1:17:18] all but it's the same bug in different
[1:17:20] stages four of them so four life
[1:17:23] Messengers had to bring it back right so
[1:17:26] you had the lion ox man and Eagle all
[1:17:28] right everybody with me then you had
[1:17:31] Luther Wesley Pentecost and then the
[1:17:33] full word restored through brother
[1:17:35] Brown's Ministry so it exactly is in
[1:17:38] those four stages we are now in the the
[1:17:41] not the this not the that not the not
[1:17:44] the shuck full
[1:17:49] grain after a long and hard struggle of
[1:17:52] Faith here comes the open door to the
[1:17:54] truth truth the word of the Lord now has
[1:17:57] its day of course the fifth age had set
[1:17:59] the stage for this Mighty move as that
[1:18:01] age give us exploration colonization
[1:18:04] printing of books
[1:18:06] Etc so now John Wesley was born in 1703
[1:18:09] to 1791 I'll read this just real quick
[1:18:12] and then we'll close the messenger to
[1:18:14] this age was without doubt John Wesley
[1:18:16] John Wesley was born in Epworth in
[1:18:18] England June 17 1703 and was one of 19
[1:18:23] children well praise
[1:18:25] Lord how did he have find time to preach
[1:18:29] his daddy his daddy's name was Samuel
[1:18:31] and Susanna Wesley his father was a
[1:18:34] chaplain in the Church of
[1:18:36] England but it is more than likely that
[1:18:38] the religious turn of John's mind was
[1:18:40] based upon his mother's exemplary life
[1:18:43] than upon his father's
[1:18:45] theology John was a brilliant scholar it
[1:18:48] was while he was at Oxford that he and
[1:18:50] Charles remember Charles is his brother
[1:18:52] all right everybody with me on that
[1:18:54] became part of a group who was
[1:18:55] spiritually exercised to worship on the
[1:18:58] basis of experimentally living the truth
[1:19:01] rather than making Doctrine their
[1:19:02] standard now watch why this is why
[1:19:05] that's why he's he's called the move
[1:19:08] it's called a Methodist move it is a
[1:19:11] method of worship that they didn't have
[1:19:13] in the other age right all right if
[1:19:16] you'll go to Methodist Church don't be
[1:19:19] scared if you go to Methodist Church
[1:19:21] they'll have it in their song book you
[1:19:23] can open their song book up and it'll
[1:19:24] say Say it'll tell you what John Wesley
[1:19:26] told them to do they don't do
[1:19:28] it they drew up a spiritual guide of
[1:19:30] works such as giving to the poor B in
[1:19:32] the sick and the imprison for this they
[1:19:34] were called Methodist in other words
[1:19:36] they had a method to do things and other
[1:19:39] derisive derive titles now John was
[1:19:42] sufficiently U ued by his vision of the
[1:19:44] need of religion now watch this John
[1:19:47] thought he was born
[1:19:51] again it'll prove to you right John
[1:19:53] thought he's born again he was going to
[1:19:55] America he actually colonized
[1:19:58] Savannah he come into Savannah stayed
[1:20:00] several years Charles did too Charles
[1:20:02] got in trouble well that's a whole
[1:20:03] another thing he went to Florida that
[1:20:04] was his first
[1:20:07] trouble nothing against Florida but I'm
[1:20:10] glad it's below
[1:20:13] us where was I so he went he went to
[1:20:17] America as a missionary amongst the
[1:20:19] Indians he was going to go to and and
[1:20:21] and take his new birth his Christianity
[1:20:24] and he was was going to give it to the
[1:20:26] Indians boy did he get Awakening if you
[1:20:29] read his whole story it was one Calamity
[1:20:32] after another they didn't like that man
[1:20:35] um James Edward othor that founded
[1:20:39] Savannah he was a buddy of John Wesley
[1:20:41] or he'd have shipped him back a lot
[1:20:42] sooner than that but he tried to send
[1:20:44] him over here and it wouldn't work tried
[1:20:46] to send him why that wasn't his job at
[1:20:49] that time John Wesley wasn't even born
[1:20:51] again he found
[1:20:53] out all
[1:20:55] right on his way there he found that
[1:20:57] many of the ship's passengers were
[1:21:00] moravians he was deeply impressed by
[1:21:02] their meekness peace and courage in all
[1:21:05] circumstances in other words there was a
[1:21:07] big storm came up and they were all
[1:21:09] having a hisy fit and the moravians were
[1:21:12] downstairs singing and praying John was
[1:21:15] impressed with
[1:21:17] that his labors in Georgia in spite of
[1:21:19] self-denials and hard work was a
[1:21:22] failure he returned to England I went to
[1:21:25] America America to convert the Indians
[1:21:27] but oh who shall convert
[1:21:30] me back in London he again met the
[1:21:33] moravians it was Paul
[1:21:35] boiler who showed him the way of
[1:21:38] Salvation he was truly Born Again much
[1:21:41] to the dis dismay if you'll read the
[1:21:43] book Charles got angry because Charles
[1:21:45] was like he built his listen I'm telling
[1:21:48] you one more time he built his
[1:21:49] experience on
[1:21:51] John's amen he said John you're already
[1:21:53] born again you're already this John
[1:21:56] whon amen but watch
[1:21:59] this he was angry because what he was
[1:22:02] saying was he was saying John you're
[1:22:05] denying this is your Born Again
[1:22:07] experience which he
[1:22:09] was who can not understand how such a
[1:22:12] spiritual man as John should say he was
[1:22:15] not formerly right with God it was
[1:22:17] however not long after that Charles too
[1:22:20] was saved by grace the work soon took on
[1:22:23] such proportions that he he began
[1:22:24] sending out numerous Layman that's the
[1:22:27] open door to preach the word this seemed
[1:22:30] like a parallel to Pentecost where the
[1:22:32] spirit raised up men with power to
[1:22:34] preach and teach the word of God almost
[1:22:38] overnight so here's your missionary age
[1:22:41] that was violent opposition to his work
[1:22:43] but God was with him let's stand our
[1:22:45] feet come on musicians we'll stop right
[1:22:47] there um there was a time when John
[1:22:49] Wesley got kicked out of all the
[1:22:51] churches he even got kicked out of his
[1:22:53] daddies he'll keep reading in the in the
[1:22:56] uh in his history and he couldn't preach
[1:22:58] anywhere they wouldn't even let him in
[1:23:00] the building to
[1:23:01] preach and his poor old Daddy had passed
[1:23:04] away and they made a mle lium of it you
[1:23:06] know put him about that high off the
[1:23:08] ground didn't bury him but put a granite
[1:23:10] thing he walked out there and he told
[1:23:12] Charles he said put my pull pit on my
[1:23:15] daddy's
[1:23:17] grave they put the pull pit on daddy's
[1:23:19] grave Charles did and he started
[1:23:21] preaching somebody came up and said
[1:23:22] something he said uh-uh he said my daddy
[1:23:24] owns this
[1:23:26] land I'm standing on my daddy's land I'm
[1:23:29] not standing on your land I'm standing
[1:23:30] on my daddy's land and while I'm here
[1:23:32] you can't knock me off and he preached I
[1:23:34] mean there would be hundreds and then
[1:23:36] thousands would be you saw the power of
[1:23:38] God working in a man's life but what did
[1:23:40] he do he absolutely one more time he
[1:23:44] preached a year he preached 800 sermons
[1:23:46] a
[1:23:48] year he traveled 4500 miles one year by
[1:23:53] horse
[1:23:57] we can't get to church on
[1:23:59] time horse he had to feed that
[1:24:04] thing he had to wire it he had to bathe
[1:24:07] it he had to pray for it one time it
[1:24:09] broke his leg he had to pray for it to
[1:24:11] get his leg healed back up so but that's
[1:24:13] the power of God in a man that yielded
[1:24:15] himself to the work of god let's yield
[1:24:18] ourself now we're in the open door we're
[1:24:20] now in the open
[1:24:22] book that's right we have no
[1:24:26] excuse to not have the power of God
[1:24:28] working in our life we have no excuse
[1:24:30] whatsoever if they can have it I can
[1:24:32] have it if they can have it you can have
[1:24:35] it let's sing a song God bless you if

[1:27:57] God you think about that old John Newton
[1:27:59] I think it was or one what was his name
[1:28:01] Aaron what was his name the guy that
[1:28:02] wrote John Newton that wrote Amazing
[1:28:05] Grace yeah yeah he sat up on a ship and
[1:28:08] he looked down and he watched the
[1:28:11] slaves they were bound they were going
[1:28:15] away from a home that they didn't even
[1:28:16] know anything about they were going to
[1:28:18] America to be slaves they were Chained
[1:28:19] and Shackled
[1:28:21] up they didn't sing those words
[1:28:24] they sang a song with that tune to it
[1:28:27] that's right John Newton the inspiration
[1:28:30] struck him and he wrote those words and
[1:28:31] there's several other verses there like
[1:28:33] six or seven verses of this of Amazing
[1:28:35] Grace that he wrote Because he saw
[1:28:38] something in those people that were
[1:28:42] enslaved that were being taken from
[1:28:45] their home that were being taken from
[1:28:47] their family very families were torn
[1:28:52] apart but John Newton looked down in
[1:28:54] that in that boat and he could look down
[1:28:56] and see the slaves and they weren't
[1:28:59] grumbling I'm just going to say it they
[1:29:02] weren't grumbling that's right they
[1:29:04] weren't a wowy wowy
[1:29:05] woo they were singing a praise song in
[1:29:08] the b in the bottom of that boat going
[1:29:12] to a place they didn't know anything
[1:29:13] about and going to be who knows where
[1:29:15] they were going to end up Georgia
[1:29:17] Louisiana Florida South Carolina they
[1:29:20] were just going to be dispersed
[1:29:21] everywhere but they didn't let it bother
[1:29:24] them their present situation only made
[1:29:28] them stronger and I thank God for that
