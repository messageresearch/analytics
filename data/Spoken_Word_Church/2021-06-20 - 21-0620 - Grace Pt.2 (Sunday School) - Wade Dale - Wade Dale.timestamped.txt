[0:00] one of you good to have you here today
[0:03] happy father's day again like he said
[0:05] but we have a heavenly father
[0:08] and we need to give thanks for every day
[0:10] i was thinking this morning i see all
[0:12] the father's day wishes are coming have
[0:13] we said our father
[0:15] which art in heaven hallowed be thy name
[0:18] thy kingdom come thy will be done in
[0:21] earth
[0:22] that is as it is in heaven give us this
[0:24] day our daily bread that all comes from
[0:25] our father
[0:27] amen great to have an earthly father but
[0:29] more
[0:30] than to have a heavenly father amen
[0:33] amen so we've been talking about grace
[0:37] if you want to go ahead and pull up
[0:38] there brother anderson
[0:40] uh the hebrew lexicon of grace would be
[0:43] we know what the prophet
[0:44] said but let's look at what the uh the
[0:46] greek lexus
[0:47] lexicon says
[0:50] took this candy out to be spitting
[0:52] everywhere
[0:54] favor now we know that the prophet god
[0:56] told us
[0:57] and we see that grace is unmerited but
[1:00] look at this word favor
[1:03] favor comes from favorite
[1:06] amen favor favorite all right
[1:10] because he does favor us
[1:13] above the world he doesn't want to
[1:18] he wants to favor everybody but see they
[1:21] will only
[1:22] only the ones that are in him will
[1:24] accept the grace that he's given
[1:27] which is charm favor elegance
[1:31] because we were talking about last
[1:32] sunday there is a
[1:34] word called grace fall now see to me the
[1:37] bride of jesus christ is graceful
[1:40] we walk because that you know you say
[1:42] this person walks with a with a
[1:44] a graceful gate well same thing with a
[1:46] christian
[1:48] the world walks with a different one
[1:51] they walk with one you can't watch amen
[1:54] that's their charm and elegance and
[1:56] that's the world but now
[1:58] with god see i like this word right here
[2:01] acceptance amen we are accepted
[2:06] in him or we are chosen in him
[2:09] before the foundation of the world all
[2:12] right let's go to the definition of
[2:13] grace in the
[2:14] in the uh webster's dictionary
[2:17] it tells us it's unmerited divine
[2:20] assistance
[2:22] now as we were talking about last sunday
[2:24] grace was
[2:25] not developed by man
[2:29] grace only comes from god satan has no
[2:32] grace
[2:33] we have a limited amount of grace
[2:37] we have a lot more condemnation because
[2:40] that's just the way we are
[2:42] but god gives us unmerited and shows
[2:45] unmerited
[2:46] divine assistance given to humans
[2:50] for their regeneration or sanctification
[2:54] so you you have to have grace to get the
[2:56] new birth
[2:57] yeah grace has to be extended and then
[3:00] grace has to keep being extended
[3:02] every day of our life all right so we're
[3:05] going to see here in just a little bit
[3:08] how that works so it's a virtue look
[3:11] coming from god
[3:12] not coming from man right
[3:15] a state of sanctification enjoyed
[3:18] through divine you see that word divine
[3:21] only god is divine so it's coming from
[3:24] god it's god's assistance it's unmerited
[3:27] godly assistance given to humans a state
[3:30] of sanctification enjoyed through
[3:32] godly assistance or i like this one
[3:34] right here approval
[3:35] yeah all right that word approval
[3:38] because let's go to genesis 6 verse 8
[3:40] we're just going to read through
[3:41] scripture
[3:42] and not read any quotes at the moment
[3:45] but noah found grace this is the first
[3:47] time you're going to see the word grace
[3:49] as in favor now you're going to see
[3:52] grace as we said before
[3:54] there is one where you say well if i
[3:57] found grace
[3:59] humanly not to god if i found grace
[4:02] in your sight or or give me grace to
[4:05] tell you this story there's plenty of
[4:07] words of grace in there but this one is
[4:09] the only the first one that says
[4:11] the hebrew lexicon 2580 that noah found
[4:14] grace in the eyes no what did he find
[4:16] favor he found
[4:17] acceptance in the eyes of the lord go to
[4:20] exodus 33
[4:22] verse 13 it says therefore i pray that
[4:25] if i have found grace in thy sight now
[4:27] who is this
[4:28] this is moses show now
[4:32] me now thy way that i may know thee that
[4:34] i may moses said
[4:35] because moses knew if the presence of
[4:36] god didn't take them he couldn't take
[4:38] them
[4:40] for within shall it be known here that i
[4:42] and thy people have found
[4:44] grace in thy sight because remember now
[4:46] grace is unmerited divine assistance
[4:50] unmerited he knew those 2 000 or 2
[4:53] million
[4:54] jews were not going to make it to the
[4:56] promised land
[4:57] but he give them grace or a time to
[5:01] repent
[5:02] poured out grace unmerited knowing they
[5:05] would do wrong
[5:07] same way with me and you is it not in
[5:10] that thou go us with us
[5:12] so shall we be separated all right
[5:15] separated i in thy people from
[5:19] all the people that are upon the face of
[5:20] the earth so in other words
[5:22] moses is praying now look at verse 17
[5:25] and the lord said unto moses
[5:27] i will do this thing that thou hast
[5:29] spoken for thou hast found grace in my
[5:31] sight in other words
[5:33] moses moses
[5:37] and hattie wright said the right thing
[5:41] right he's telling moses you've said the
[5:44] right thing
[5:45] hattie wright said the right thing and
[5:46] found grace in the eyes of god
[5:49] by saying the right thing all right and
[5:52] i will do this thing also that thou hast
[5:54] spoken for thou has found grace
[5:57] in my sight and i know thee by name
[6:01] and i said and he said i beseech thee
[6:03] show me thy glory and that's what he
[6:05] asked about was to show
[6:08] me who you are now let's go to ruth 2
[6:11] verse 8.
[6:14] we can have sunday service now tim
[6:16] afternoon
[6:18] sir here
[6:20] then said bull house under ruth here is
[6:23] thou not my daughter
[6:25] go not to glean in another field neither
[6:28] go from hence but abide here fast by my
[6:30] maidens and we talked about this last
[6:32] sunday
[6:33] we're talking about grace this is grace
[6:35] part two
[6:38] because boaz didn't know ruth that well
[6:41] he knew naomi was kinfolk to him but now
[6:43] ruth was not ken she was a moabiter she
[6:45] was a
[6:47] right but boaz type in christ
[6:50] because look what she's what he says let
[6:53] thine eyes be on the field that thou do
[6:55] reap
[6:55] and go thou after them have i not
[6:58] charged the young men that they shall
[7:00] not touch thee now he's never met this
[7:02] this girl before and when thou art the
[7:04] thirst going to the vessels and drink of
[7:06] that which the young men of drum
[7:07] then she fell on her face and bowed
[7:08] herself to the ground and said unto him
[7:11] why have i found
[7:12] grace in thy eyes remember grace is what
[7:15] unmerited favor
[7:16] or favor or approval
[7:20] right then she fell on her face and
[7:22] bowed herself to the ground and said why
[7:24] have i found grace
[7:26] in thy eyes have you ever asked god that
[7:28] i have several times lord why me why in
[7:31] the world
[7:32] because he has given me unmerited favor
[7:35] and he knows the end from the beginning
[7:39] that we will accept god he knew that
[7:41] there was something about this woman
[7:42] look that thou should have taken
[7:43] knowledge of me
[7:45] seeing i am a stranger now watch what
[7:48] boaz said
[7:49] boaz answered and said unto her it had
[7:51] fully been showed me
[7:55] by revelation boaz knew who
[7:59] ruth was now watch
[8:02] that all that thou hast done unto thy
[8:05] mother-in-law
[8:06] since the death of thy husband
[8:10] i was telling you before last sunday
[8:12] listen
[8:13] unmerited favor is what god does not
[8:15] what you do
[8:17] but listen you do have something to do
[8:20] because if you don't and you say well
[8:22] it's just me and i can go do this and i
[8:24] can sin all i want to
[8:25] that's greasy grace right right that's
[8:28] not god's grace
[8:30] grace is unmerited favor and you say
[8:32] well i have the prophet tells us many
[8:34] times there's nothing you have to do it
[8:35] we know that
[8:36] but it is a lot what we have to do right
[8:39] god knows what we'll do with it before
[8:41] we do it by pre-predestination
[8:44] predestined journey by for knowledge
[8:47] not just by a set time and a set place
[8:49] and this is what it's going to be
[8:52] because like i said before god would
[8:53] love to give grace to the whole world
[8:55] but he knows the whole world will not
[8:56] accept that grace
[8:58] a pardon is not a pardon unless it's
[9:00] accepted as a pardon
[9:02] all right and boaz answered and said to
[9:03] her it had fully been
[9:05] showed me all that thou hast done unto
[9:07] thy mother-in-law since the death of
[9:09] thine husband
[9:10] and that thou that thou hast left thy
[9:11] father and thy mother
[9:13] you've left the world right and the land
[9:17] of your nativity in other words your
[9:18] first birth
[9:20] and art coming to a people which thou
[9:22] knowest not heretofore
[9:25] the lord recompense thy work
[9:29] and a full reward be given thee of the
[9:32] lord god of israel under whose wings
[9:34] thou art come
[9:36] to trust all right so now let's go to
[9:39] the
[9:40] next lady in the bible that found grace
[9:43] in esther 2 verse 16.
[9:46] now watch this so esther we know the
[9:48] story of esther that
[9:50] um you know one thing's for sure she was
[9:53] the queen
[9:54] but she had to be called or summoned to
[9:57] be able to go into the court or it was
[9:59] death if
[10:00] if if the king didn't put out the
[10:02] sepulcher
[10:04] all right the scepter then she would be
[10:06] killed it doesn't matter if she's queen
[10:07] or not
[10:08] amen but now remember
[10:12] he loved esther oh yeah
[10:15] he loved esther he loved her from the
[10:18] beginning from the first time he saw her
[10:20] he loved her
[10:21] so esther was taken unto king asaurus
[10:24] into his house royal in the ten tenth
[10:26] month which is the month tibeth
[10:28] in the seventh year of his reign and the
[10:30] king loved esther above all the women
[10:34] after being a type of the bride he loved
[10:37] her above
[10:37] all the women and she obtained grace and
[10:40] favor in his sight more than
[10:44] all the virgins
[10:47] how about that so that he set the royal
[10:50] crown upon her head and made her queen
[10:53] instead of vashti and we know the whole
[10:55] story we've been through it
[10:57] of the book of esther but look what
[11:01] happened later on
[11:06] when she had a dire need to save her
[11:09] people
[11:11] that she said i haven't seen the queen
[11:13] and the king in 30 days he has not
[11:15] called for me in other words
[11:16] the call's not come for me to meet the
[11:19] king
[11:20] but i'm going in anyway and if i die i
[11:22] die if i live i live
[11:24] and what happened when she walked in the
[11:26] king saw her hadn't seen her in 30 days
[11:28] and
[11:29] that was a woman he loved jesus hadn't
[11:32] seen us in 2000 years
[11:35] amen he hasn't physically looked on us
[11:37] in 2000 years but when we enter the
[11:39] court
[11:40] and not put on the world apparel
[11:45] the bible says she shunned all that and
[11:47] they tried to put this on her and tried
[11:49] to
[11:49] kind of like david they tried to put
[11:50] this on him and they tried to put they
[11:52] said no
[11:52] i'm going like i am she said i'm going
[11:55] like i am if i live i live and that's
[11:57] the way we should be
[11:58] not just with the message of the hour
[11:59] but with christianity
[12:01] to find grace in the eyes of god doesn't
[12:03] take this message
[12:08] but it does take you up that statue of a
[12:10] perfect man
[12:12] it takes you it makes you a mature
[12:14] christian
[12:16] that's what we want to be that's the
[12:17] call of this hour is not just to be
[12:19] christians it's to be mature christians
[12:22] know what god wants know what god wants
[12:27] before he even asks it
[12:31] that's what he said psalms 84 verse 11
[12:35] says for the lord god is a sun and
[12:37] shield
[12:38] the lord will give grace and glory
[12:40] there's no one like i said before
[12:42] man cannot develop this word called
[12:45] grace
[12:46] it had to be a divine person
[12:50] right that could see the end from the
[12:52] beginning to give grace
[12:54] to a group of people unmerited favor
[12:59] and glory no good thing will he withhold
[13:02] from them
[13:03] that walk upright
[13:07] like i said before we're we're not a
[13:09] church of do's and don'ts
[13:12] but if you get the new birth a lot of
[13:14] that gets taken care of
[13:16] you can preach here and this and we've
[13:18] heard heron dress for 50 years
[13:21] and the women still do it and the men
[13:22] still do what they do
[13:24] but i'll promise you if you get born
[13:26] again you won't do that
[13:28] okay so i'm just as plain as i can be at
[13:31] women if you're cutting your hair
[13:32] wearing makeup doing the things the
[13:33] prophet should not do you're not born
[13:34] again
[13:36] and you're going to meet god that way
[13:38] same way amen men we do things we're not
[13:40] supposed to do you're going to meet god
[13:41] with that you're not going to meet the
[13:42] prophet you're going to meet god with it
[13:44] right that's right now we know and i'm
[13:48] going to develop this only further
[13:49] because remember we had to come to a
[13:51] place
[13:52] that we needed a grace of marriage and
[13:55] divorce that had to be given to us
[13:57] by an individual man a prophet
[14:02] right amen a prophet had to give us
[14:06] grace but it wasn't his grace
[14:09] he was extending god's grace he was
[14:11] extending
[14:12] he was extending the supper sepulchre
[14:15] when we entered into this
[14:17] last church age to give us a grace of
[14:20] marriage and divorce not just for our
[14:23] fleshly marital problems but for our
[14:25] spiritual
[14:26] marital problems because a lot of people
[14:29] are still married to their own husband
[14:31] or even just divorced him or put him in
[14:33] a closet
[14:34] no the bible says your husband needs to
[14:36] be dead that's what the prophet was
[14:38] trying to tell the people
[14:39] your whole husband needs to be dead
[14:40] right if you're
[14:42] if your old husband is dead you're free
[14:44] to marry
[14:46] only in the lord right everybody got
[14:48] there
[14:50] proverbs 1 verse 7
[14:54] the fear of the lord is the beginning of
[14:55] knowledge
[14:57] but fools despise wisdom and instruction
[15:00] we've seen that haven't we my son hear
[15:03] the instruction that says father's day
[15:05] my son hear the instruction of thy
[15:07] father and forsake not the law of thy
[15:08] mother
[15:09] for they shall be an ornament of grace
[15:13] unto thy head and chains about thy neck
[15:17] many times we look at the the ten
[15:19] commandments which the world has made
[15:21] them ten suggestions
[15:23] not ten commandments all right it's just
[15:26] 10 suggestions
[15:27] same way in the message there's a lot of
[15:29] quotes that they just want to suggest
[15:30] that you listen to or
[15:31] you want to quote so but anyway they
[15:34] shall be an ornament of grace until i
[15:36] head in chains about thy neck
[15:38] you and i are brother brown said we're
[15:40] robed
[15:42] with unmerited grace unmerited favor
[15:46] so like as as um brother ronnie was
[15:50] uh we had a little service there on
[15:51] friday afternoon for the young
[15:54] for all us young kids all those young
[15:56] men
[15:57] and that's what we got to do we got to
[15:59] make sure we do the right thing we're
[16:01] men
[16:02] the men we have to carry the gospel the
[16:05] women can't carry the gospel
[16:07] and if satan can mess us up from the
[16:09] beginning see we go past that grace we
[16:11] come out from under that unmerited
[16:14] favor and it becomes greasy grace and
[16:16] you see people double married triple med
[16:18] trying to preach in the message and
[16:20] it's just not going to happen ain't
[16:22] going to work out god cannot go over
[16:24] his word and make it well
[16:28] you know what well it'll be all right no
[16:30] well it won't be all right
[16:32] a well is a deep subject for
[16:33] shallow-minded people
[16:38] ain't that right louise hey buddy
[16:43] my son hear the instructions of thy
[16:44] father and forsake not the law of thy
[16:46] mother
[16:47] for they shall be an ornament of grace
[16:49] unto thy head and chains about thy neck
[16:52] even in the ten commandments it tells us
[16:54] to honor our father and mother that your
[16:56] days remember that's the only one with
[16:58] the first one with promise in the ten
[17:00] commandments honor your father mother
[17:02] that your days may be long
[17:04] on the face of the earth amen we see a
[17:06] lot of kids
[17:07] out in the world that die very young
[17:11] why you don't know maybe they dishonor
[17:13] their mother and father they're not
[17:14] doing what god said to do
[17:16] exactly and i've seen people that live
[17:18] long lives because they've always
[17:19] honored their father and their mother
[17:21] see that now that's
[17:22] that's in the bible amen that's in the
[17:25] bible so we don't need to we don't
[17:27] need to get rid of that it's not a
[17:28] suggestion kids
[17:31] us all of us for they shall be an
[17:33] ornament of grace in other words what do
[17:34] you do with an ornament you wear it
[17:37] you wear it and show the world now the
[17:40] problem is is we try to show the
[17:43] sometimes try to show the world that
[17:44] we're up here
[17:47] and we're better than them people out
[17:49] there now that's not
[17:50] that's not god that's not god now we're
[17:53] talking about last sunday about the son
[17:55] of man if we're supposed to act like the
[17:56] son of man
[17:57] the son of man the bible says
[18:00] the bible says that the son of man was
[18:03] not and you know
[18:04] jesus told him said well you know they
[18:06] said well that's just the carpenters boy
[18:08] that's
[18:08] joseph's son that he's a wine beverage
[18:11] look we think he drinks a little too
[18:12] much wine we
[18:13] he hangs around with and he hangs
[18:14] around with sinners and
[18:16] and all that and they asked jesus about
[18:18] that and what jesus saying
[18:20] he said a prophet doesn't have honor
[18:23] in his own country they don't honor him
[18:25] because he's just brother bill
[18:28] he's just brother sam he's just brother
[18:29] wade he all these different things
[18:31] and we were talking about that um
[18:34] yesterday afternoon
[18:37] the son of man was humble the son of man
[18:40] didn't carry his bible like brother
[18:41] branham
[18:44] he didn't wear belt buckles and all that
[18:46] stuff
[18:48] i thought that's what we're supposed to
[18:49] be we're supposed to be the son of man
[18:51] in the end time we're not supposed to
[18:54] have to shout we're not supposed to have
[18:55] to scream
[18:56] at demons jesus talked to him
[18:59] and that's what the son of man did
[19:03] that's the son of man folks we got to
[19:05] get out of pentecost
[19:07] we got to get into the son of man
[19:08] ministry and act like him read matthew
[19:10] mark luke and john
[19:12] that's the son of man if that ministry
[19:14] is to come back in the end time
[19:16] there's our grace our grace is that he
[19:18] saw that we would accept that son of man
[19:20] message
[19:21] and not turn it into a pentecostal
[19:22] revival
[19:27] just saying let's read this right here
[19:29] in zechariah and then we'll be done
[19:31] musicians get ready to come zechariah 4
[19:34] verse 6. listen to this
[19:36] then he answered and speaking to me
[19:37] saying this is the word of the lord unto
[19:39] zerubbabel
[19:40] saying not by might nor by power but by
[19:42] my spirit saith the lord of hosts
[19:45] who out there oh great mountain now what
[19:46] are we talking about we're talking about
[19:48] the end time we're talking about a
[19:49] zerubbabel coming in
[19:50] and you know getting the foundation
[19:53] swept off and
[19:54] and be able to build this mountain we
[19:56] call the statue of a perfect man
[19:58] who art thou great mountain before
[20:00] zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain and
[20:02] he shall bring forth the headstone now
[20:04] who is the headstone
[20:06] that's the son of man amen
[20:09] that's what the ages have lost that's
[20:11] what brother branham they couldn't
[20:13] understand why he was preaching
[20:14] the way he was preaching and they turned
[20:16] him down because they turned jesus down
[20:19] in the same way and they'll turn you
[20:21] down
[20:22] and he shall bring forth the headstone
[20:24] thereof with shoutings crying what
[20:26] not just graves thank god he sent us a
[20:31] prophet to say listen
[20:32] if god says something twice you better
[20:35] listen
[20:36] when jesus said verily verily he said
[20:38] you better listen to what he's saying
[20:40] shouting what unmerited favor unmerited
[20:43] favor
[20:44] unto it sister hattie wright didn't have
[20:46] to do anything she just believed what
[20:48] the prophet of god said
[20:51] and he said whatever you ask
[20:54] that's what you'll get right and merit
[20:56] he didn't say now hattie you don't have
[20:58] no money you don't have this and
[20:59] he ain't mentioned all that you've got a
[21:01] sister's in a wheelchair
[21:03] he said she asked the greatest thing
[21:07] and god gave grace to two boys
[21:11] that had not had grace before through
[21:14] their mother
[21:15] right interceding listen to this last
[21:17] one and it will close right here
[21:18] musicians get ready to come
[21:20] zechariah 12 10 and i will pour
[21:23] upon the house of david now what is the
[21:26] house of david
[21:27] jews not gentiles because remember this
[21:31] derubable crying grace grace unto it it
[21:33] was to rebuild the temple
[21:37] rebuild and restore worship to israel
[21:41] but a type is to do the same thing with
[21:43] me and you as elijah did on mount carmel
[21:45] he restored the altar right
[21:49] and turned them back he didn't turn them
[21:52] back but
[21:52] he said lord that i may turn them back
[21:54] but that's what the message of elijah
[21:56] was
[21:57] was to turn the hearts back to the faith
[21:59] of the fathers and that's what happened
[22:01] to us
[22:02] in the first part of his ministry and i
[22:04] will pour upon the house of david upon
[22:06] the inhabitants of jerusalem the spirit
[22:07] of what
[22:08] grace and supplication and they shall
[22:10] look upon me whom they have pierced and
[22:12] they shall mourn from
[22:14] for him as one mourning for his only son
[22:16] and shall be in bitterness for him as
[22:18] one that is
[22:18] bitterness for his firstborn what are
[22:21] you saying brother wade listen
[22:22] our grace that we get the grace that we
[22:24] have is going to take us in a rapture
[22:27] but it's not going to finish it's going
[22:29] to go to jerusalem
[22:31] and under the last week of daniel 70
[22:33] weeks where the six-fold purpose is to
[22:35] happen
[22:36] that six-fold purpose is to extend grace
[22:38] to israel
[22:40] according to zechariah and i will pour
[22:41] out upon the house of david because he
[22:43] can't do it now
[22:45] because he's dealing with gentiles he
[22:47] can't deal with the gentiles and jews at
[22:48] the same time
[22:50] but he's going to pour out upon the
[22:51] inhabitants of jerusalem the spirit of
[22:53] grace
[22:54] and of supplication everybody got that
[22:58] so our the grace that we get is going to
[23:00] be extended
[23:01] right over there to the jews and they're
[23:03] going to get a three and a half year
[23:05] ministry of grace
[23:08] from two prophets after we're gone
[23:13] but grace will be extended to them
[23:15] because right now
[23:17] look what he says he says look they
[23:19] shall look upon me whom they have
[23:20] pierced
[23:21] and they shall mourn for him as one
[23:23] morning for his only son
[23:25] those two prophets come on musicians are
[23:27] going to preach
[23:30] so much grace
[23:34] that they're going to say where did you
[23:35] get those scars he says in the house of
[23:36] my friends
[23:39] and god's not going to destroy him he
[23:40] said he wouldn't destroy him he's not
[23:42] going to destroy israel
[23:44] he's going to redeem her back but not
[23:46] redeem her back his bride because he
[23:47] can't have two brides at the same time
[23:50] amen so god bless you think of that
[23:53] grace is unmerited favor
[23:56] you say well now brother dale's been
[23:58] telling us it's nothing we do yeah
[24:00] it's nothing you've done but it has a
[24:03] lot to do with what you do
[24:05] everybody got there they'll say well now
[24:08] i don't have to go to church i've got
[24:10] the message of the hour i'm about this
[24:11] full with it you know i've got to ever
[24:12] quote and i know every book and
[24:14] i know where brother dale's going to
[24:15] preach next week because he preached it
[24:16] last week so i think i'll just stay home
[24:18] well now that's not grace right that may
[24:21] be greasy grace
[24:22] but that ain't grace grace has unmerited
[24:25] favor from god as he saw what you would
[24:27] do with the word that he gave you
[24:30] when he sees what you do with the word
[24:33] he gave you not bob
[24:35] not brother bob he gave me and he gave
[24:36] you the word
[24:38] individual word that he gives each one
[24:40] of us because listen
[24:41] grace is not for a crowd except hold on
[24:45] israel it's for 144 000 for a group
[24:48] gentiles it's individuals
[24:52] amen unmerited favor for individuals
[24:55] as a gentile bride but now remember he
[24:57] saw who would
[24:58] and he saw who wouldn't before knowledge
[25:01] so therefore then he could predestinate
[25:03] because he predestinated by what he saw
[25:07] you do when you got here amen god bless
[25:12] you
[25:17] [Music]
[25:19] you
