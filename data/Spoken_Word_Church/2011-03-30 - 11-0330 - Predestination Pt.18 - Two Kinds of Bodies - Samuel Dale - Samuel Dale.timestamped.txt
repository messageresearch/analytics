[11:51] little bit better looking out in the
[11:53] parking lot amen any other announcements
[11:56] until May forget something
[11:59] so I know Terrence said they had changed
[12:01] the uh
[12:03] the date there on the uh together and
[12:06] together for the Easter they're down at

[12:15] or whatever it'll be on the 16th so
[12:17] remember that and that
[12:19] Genesis will go to First Corinthians 15
[12:22] first and then we'll go to Genesis 1.
[12:26] how do we thank you we love you and we
[12:28] ask you that you would just bless us
[12:30] with your presence and your
[12:32] understanding Lord that you'd come and
[12:33] be with us and that you've got each and
[12:36] every one of us Lord and and just touch
[12:39] those that are sick and not able to be
[12:40] with us tonight and those that are sin
[12:43] sick Lord we ask you to reach down and
[12:45] touch into their lives also and just let
[12:48] everything be all right we love you and
[12:49] we thank you and as we read your word
[12:52] now you come and and speak to us Lord
[12:54] the word that you'd have for us to say
[12:56] guide us now and keep us in Jesus name
[13:00] amen
[13:02] I'm gonna go to First Corinthians 15 now
[13:05] I'm not trying I'm got a point coming
[13:08] out of here and it's not trying to tie
[13:11] together the resurrection or anything so
[13:13] I just wanting to to bring a point to
[13:16] you and then we will get back to that in
[13:19] about 20 sermons down the road but uh
[13:22] you know I'm just wanting to bring a
[13:24] point so let's go to First Corinthians
[13:26] 15 and we'll begin reading
[13:30] about verse 39.
[13:33] Paul says in all flesh is not the same
[13:36] flesh
[13:37] but there's one kind of a flesh of men
[13:39] Another Kind another flesh of Beast and
[13:43] another of fishes and another Birds now
[13:46] he's just explaining the natural thing
[13:48] right like I said I don't want to get
[13:50] into this this covers the resurrection
[13:52] of what kind of a body and things but
[13:54] I'm not dealing with that now so just
[13:55] stay with me of what we're doing look at
[13:58] verse 40.
[13:59] there there are also celestial bodies
[14:03] which is Heavenly
[14:05] and bodies terrestrial which is Earthly
[14:08] all right now but the glory of the
[14:11] celestial is one and the glory of the
[14:13] terrestrial is another
[14:15] there is one glory of the Sun and
[14:17] another glory of the Moon and another
[14:18] glory of the stars for one star
[14:21] different from different from another in
[14:24] glory so also is the resurrection of the
[14:26] dead it is sown in corruption it is
[14:28] raised in incorruption it is sown in
[14:31] dishonor it is raised in glory it is
[14:33] sown in weakness it is raised in power
[14:36] it is shown a natural body it is raised
[14:38] a spiritual body
[14:40] there is a natural body and that's the
[14:44] point I want you to get now
[14:46] there is a natural body and there is a
[14:50] spiritual body
[14:52] all right now verse 40 says there are
[14:55] celestial bodies heavenly
[14:59] and they are you know spiritually and
[15:02] they are Earthly terrestrial bodies
[15:05] verse 45 tells you then where do we
[15:07] start from and so it is written the
[15:10] first man Adam was made a living soul
[15:13] Elijah Adam was made a quickening spirit
[15:16] all right now the first Adam we know who
[15:19] that is and the last Adam is Jesus
[15:21] Christ okay all right so then we'll
[15:24] we'll get back into that later but look
[15:25] in Genesis 1 26 and 27 and
[15:29] we'll read this and we're not going to
[15:31] get down into the total depth of this
[15:33] tonight we just want it's got something
[15:35] I want to get across to you
[15:37] all right so this be a point I want to
[15:39] make tonight of the message you'll be
[15:41] tying in with Sunday's message
[15:43] verse 26 says and God said let us make
[15:46] man in our image after our likeness and
[15:48] let them have dominion over the fish of
[15:50] the sin over the fowl of the air and
[15:52] over the cattle and over all of the
[15:54] earth and over ever
[15:56] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[15:58] Earth so God created man in his own
[16:00] image in the image of God created he him
[16:03] male and female created he them you may
[16:07] be seated Lord that is blessing to the
[16:10] reading of the word now
[16:13] as I said I'm not gonna I'm not trying
[16:15] to deal with anything of the
[16:17] resurrection and and we'll get into just
[16:20] touching some things of what you know of
[16:23] more into what we're trying to get to
[16:27] but I want you to to think tonight with
[16:30] me
[16:31] into tithe in with Sunday's message I
[16:34] wanted to continue on and this kept
[16:36] coming back so uh maybe we need to cover
[16:40] it more now the point I was trying to
[16:42] get across to us on Sunday afternoon
[16:47] it's trying to find out the real you
[16:52] what you really are
[16:55] now
[16:57] we know that we're Body Spirit soul
[17:02] all right we understand that we can read
[17:05] it but do we understand it
[17:08] do we understand which is the most real
[17:11] which part of you is the most real part
[17:14] of you
[17:15] all right we found out that the bodies
[17:19] now we're not going to get a new one but
[17:21] these bodies will one day be destroyed
[17:23] if we go by the grave and and do not
[17:27] take a change all right you know what
[17:29] I'm saying if we're not changing them
[17:30] old quickly when I were going by the
[17:32] grave so these bodies are going to be
[17:34] destroyed all right so we would want
[17:36] that to be the the part of us that would
[17:39] be uh the most important part
[17:42] not that one is greater than the other
[17:44] but still that way and and we know that
[17:47] it is not the spirit of mankind that
[17:50] would be uh you know the the most
[17:53] important part because uh that way we
[17:56] could get into anointed ones and uh we
[18:00] would be dealing on anointed ones as
[18:03] things and see that it would really give
[18:05] us a lot of trouble
[18:07] but we found out that the real center
[18:10] part of you are the most important poor
[18:14] part important part of us is the soul
[18:17] amen you're being right of what you are
[18:21] you're you're you know your your life
[18:23] you're what you're it's actually you
[18:26] and that's the most important thing that
[18:28] there is about us because we went
[18:31] through the scriptures covering it how
[18:33] it doesn't say the body that sinneth
[18:35] because the body can't sin all right the
[18:37] body only displays sin of what the rest
[18:40] is you hit a man over the head you put
[18:42] him out unconscious he can't sin
[18:45] all right then you you just take a
[18:48] spiritual part away from him and and and
[18:50] you know he he he's he's he's got a
[18:54] problem all right but uh the real you is
[18:57] that Soul all right that inward part of
[19:00] you and it's so important until that's
[19:04] the part that God
[19:06] begins to work on where Satan whereas
[19:10] took the the mind the head
[19:13] but God chose the heart the soul of
[19:16] mankind to be able to do his doings I
[19:21] was thinking there the other day you
[19:22] know it's a little bit said something
[19:23] about it this last Sunday was a I hope
[19:26] that everybody really understood what
[19:28] I'm saying because they say now you can
[19:31] learn a new language by sleeping
[19:33] so I guess this past Sunday I got my
[19:36] point across
[19:38] you get what is those
[19:40] you know
[19:41] you sleep through the service at least
[19:43] you know what I'm talking about so so
[19:46] you know all right but uh I'm just going
[19:50] to say that because that's you know we
[19:52] can learn a new language that way so
[19:53] maybe you got something all right but I
[19:57] understand and I I I'll sympathize with
[20:00] you and that's why I say contrary to
[20:02] everybody other preachers you know
[20:04] they'll say you not to do this not to do
[20:07] that
[20:08] um you know put a cough drop in or do
[20:10] something or you know some kind of a
[20:13] something if you don't do that put them
[20:15] in your mouth but now don't go to
[20:16] chewing gum
[20:18] don't don't get into the chewing gum
[20:21] business you know because that'll mess
[20:22] everything up you know but you know
[20:25] don't rattle the papers and and
[20:27] everything try to be as quiet as you can
[20:30] and this would just be human and do the
[20:33] best you can of trying to stay awake
[20:35] because I know on Sunday afternoon is a
[20:38] hard time for us and I understand that
[20:40] but I still like to have the the
[20:43] services all right but now
[20:46] as I said we were trying to explain
[20:48] something
[20:49] of the real you
[20:52] and no matter if it's even in a fallen
[20:54] estate
[20:56] you know even if if it's in just a
[20:59] fallen estate uh an unregenerated person
[21:04] you just think about how great that
[21:07] person is that they can you know that
[21:10] it's almost the Bible says that nothing
[21:13] would be refrained from them you know if
[21:15] he happened to cast them out they would
[21:17] have just went right on and just
[21:18] sweeping along and and what a man can
[21:21] imagine in his his mind he can pretty
[21:24] well come up with it right you know and
[21:26] make it because that's what's the
[21:28] difference between him and an animal
[21:29] because that animal just builds his nest
[21:32] the same does the same it adapts yes it
[21:35] has to but it has does not have the
[21:38] reasoning factor of the human being that
[21:42] comes with the soul all right now in
[21:45] that then with that behind us
[21:48] and thinking I said even just in the
[21:50] natural so I want you to kind of stay in
[21:53] that with me tonight that you know don't
[21:55] get over into uh the new birth as much
[21:58] as as we will Sunday the Lord willing
[22:02] and and all and even like reading 126
[22:05] and 27 the purpose of reading that is to
[22:09] see that no matter what a man is whether
[22:12] he's lost or not he still is in the
[22:15] image of God
[22:17] and that was the point I was trying to
[22:19] get across you said oh no no he's just
[22:21] in the image of God when he's born again
[22:23] well now that's you know we are little
[22:25] creators uh you know we're we're people
[22:29] and we can can come up with a better way
[22:31] of doing things and and reason out the
[22:34] things that we need to to look at and
[22:36] see how to build something or anything
[22:38] like that you know and and all and but
[22:41] now keep that it'll say now keep that
[22:43] kind of down with me tonight don't don't
[22:45] go into the new birth as much we'll pick
[22:48] that up the Lord willing Sunday and uh
[22:51] continue on with it but I want you to
[22:53] think about what Paul is saying
[22:56] when he was explaining there
[22:59] that in First Corinthians 15
[23:03] that their celestial bodies
[23:06] Heavenly you know
[23:09] and there's terrestrial bodies
[23:12] which is Earthly
[23:14] all right now
[23:16] then he goes on down to it explains the
[23:21] that about these that there's a natural
[23:24] body and there's a spiritual body
[23:27] okay now so then we know about the
[23:32] natural body right
[23:34] that's easy to comprehend the flesh we
[23:36] live in that's the Natural Body all
[23:39] right but there's also a spiritual body
[23:42] right
[23:43] right hey
[23:45] that's you
[23:46] right
[23:52] you know even in the condition of of
[23:55] where that we're unregenerated
[23:58] you still have that part of you that is
[24:02] more real than your body and your spirit
[24:08] because it's in the image of your maker
[24:11] right
[24:13] he's a Creator we're a little creator
[24:16] right all right and in doing that now
[24:19] Paul at least he's explaining that
[24:22] there's two bodies
[24:24] okay
[24:25] now there's heavenly bodies and there's
[24:28] Earthly bodies
[24:29] all right but I don't believe see he's
[24:32] talking about the resurrection and the
[24:34] things and I don't believe he's talking
[24:36] about an Earthly body here and a
[24:39] Heavenly Body up there all right right
[24:42] now I just don't believe that that's
[24:45] fine but what I think he's talking about
[24:48] because it's all right here amen the
[24:51] resurrection and everything is within
[24:52] you you know right so then what he's
[24:55] really explaining is is that there's two
[25:00] you you have two bodies right
[25:03] you so now wait a minute now if you want
[25:05] it here no no no
[25:07] you have a natural body
[25:14] I hear this the 16 elements all right
[25:17] now and then then within dire
[25:22] is a spiritual body right
[25:26] and no matter if you're you're lost now
[25:28] keep it with me on that so you're happy
[25:30] to understand even if you're lost
[25:33] me a lost person has a soul just like a
[25:36] born-again person has a soul amen right
[25:39] all right because that soul is what you
[25:41] are amen right all right and two see it
[25:44] will have to go somewhere
[25:47] when we die
[25:49] that part that is within us is going
[25:52] somewhere now the body goes back to the
[25:55] dust where it come from
[25:57] huh but inside of you is
[26:02] another body if you want to call it
[26:03] right so we have two bodies one is a
[26:08] natural body that we're living up on
[26:10] Earth come from the earth the other one
[26:12] is a spiritual body which is your soul
[26:15] amen which is your being which is what
[26:18] you are
[26:19] man all right now that comes from God as
[26:22] we read there the other day and and was
[26:24] bringing out on Ezekiel 18 4.
[26:27] that
[26:29] the Bible said All Souls are mine
[26:33] now if there's a soul any word God had
[26:36] to create it right because Satan can't
[26:39] create that's why that I I differ
[26:41] totally with people when they want to
[26:43] just say the soul is just the nature of
[26:46] the spirit
[26:47] I mean you're just you're just making it
[26:49] like it's nothing it's not Connection in
[26:52] in any form but I believe the soul is
[26:55] more real than your body amen amen
[26:58] because that's where we're going to live
[27:02] if you die right now before the change
[27:06] all right you're going somewhere
[27:10] work all right see Sarah or saying we
[27:15] have a place made for us
[27:17] amen and it can be called even to the
[27:20] center see it's called a celestial
[27:25] heavenly
[27:29] me being a part of you all right so then
[27:34] to understand who we are
[27:37] then you'll see where salvation takes
[27:40] place
[27:43] salvation don't take place in your body
[27:46] all right
[27:48] it's only this plane right it doesn't
[27:51] take place in your spirit right right
[27:57] that needs to be under control yeah
[28:00] right
[28:01] so if you can control the spirit Spirit
[28:04] and control the body everything will be
[28:05] under but the real control tower is the
[28:08] inside of you
[28:11] leave right now let's even show in the
[28:14] natural or the unregenerated right
[28:18] did that part of you and I
[28:22] and we'll get to it Sunday when the
[28:24] prophet will get more like sold in
[28:25] prison when he said if he can get that
[28:27] sold or stand still long enough
[28:30] right he said it'll die
[28:34] all right see because you that's the
[28:36] only place the new birth can take place
[28:38] in is the soul of the individual amen if
[28:41] it's in a spirit realm then it's
[28:44] it's just anointed ones that's right
[28:47] amen and all anointed ones would be the
[28:49] same because they'd have the Baptist
[28:50] with the Holy Ghost
[28:52] right the prophet said you know how the
[28:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost every day of
[28:56] your life on your spirit be and see and
[28:58] die and go to hell all right the real
[29:00] genuine baptism of the Holy Spirit
[29:04] thank you
[29:05] we'll see then when I'm trying to get us
[29:08] to think about is is how do you know
[29:11] whether you're saved or not come on Amen
[29:13] right how do you know
[29:16] well I want to go to church show this
[29:19] anointing month right
[29:22] I I I love God you love God with your
[29:25] spirit yeah
[29:30] that way we can find out what the New
[29:32] Birth really is amen
[29:35] and where it takes place
[29:38] then you'll see why that God had to come
[29:42] down
[29:43] yep that's right
[29:44] he to release the life that he had right
[29:48] because the anointing could come on him
[29:50] and go off of him right he did in the
[29:53] garden it came on him on the River
[29:54] Jordan went out off of him in the in the
[29:57] garden right but not the spirit part of
[29:59] him of life
[30:01] but that great anointing and that's why
[30:04] I can come back on anointed ones
[30:08] right all right people that are not
[30:10] Christians right amen because it's in
[30:13] that Realm
[30:15] all right but it can also come on you
[30:17] and I all right and we'll get back more
[30:19] of that that's what I'm trying to see uh
[30:21] I didn't I didn't think my point got
[30:23] across maybe to me all right
[30:25] and uh
[30:28] I hope some of you isn't over again
[30:29] where you can get what I was talking
[30:31] about anyhow
[30:34] and listen
[30:36] Paul says
[30:39] in verse 45
[30:41] as it is written
[30:44] the first man Adam
[30:47] was made a living Soul right all right
[30:51] now and the life Adam now that's Jesus
[30:54] Christ amen right
[30:57] amen
[30:58] it was made a quickening spirit right
[31:01] all right now he goes on to be specific
[31:04] and I don't want to get too much into it
[31:06] but he goes on into verse 45 and says
[31:09] how be it it was not the spirit that
[31:12] came first right
[31:14] spiritual
[31:16] it was a natural
[31:18] he said wait no way this way
[31:21] because you know he was see you're
[31:24] you're hooked on
[31:25] connection then as to what we'll get to
[31:29] in a minute that Adam was first the
[31:31] spirit name but that's not what Paul's
[31:33] explaining right Paul's explaining the
[31:36] first Adam and the second Adam
[31:39] all right I want to say that just in
[31:41] case you're going down to their reading
[31:42] and and thinking of the point see who
[31:45] came first right the natural atom
[31:49] came first then the spiritual atom which
[31:53] is Christ
[31:54] come into flesh to be able to die for
[31:57] you and I right see the first Adam was
[31:59] Adam the second Adam was Jesus Christ
[32:02] all right now so then that means that
[32:05] see
[32:07] the human being came first
[32:10] right because that would be where we
[32:11] would kind of into the sin and and have
[32:13] to be born again all right now but watch
[32:16] what I'm what I'm getting at now
[32:18] all is explaining
[32:21] that there is a spiritual body
[32:26] and there's a natural body
[32:28] huh
[32:29] right so now why is that spiritual body
[32:38] it would be the real you
[32:41] right
[32:44] all right and being the real you then
[32:50] it would
[32:52] be more real than the body you're living
[32:55] in
[32:57] right yep and see and that's where the
[33:00] the thing will have to come together
[33:02] I believe
[33:04] that one day this inward man
[33:07] it's hard to stay off from preaching on
[33:09] what you want to go on with but
[33:12] I got a point I want to get across but
[33:14] see the inward man is the one that's
[33:16] supposed to be of the controllers right
[33:17] right amen
[33:19] and that's your soul your being you know
[33:22] what you are that's right
[33:24] all right that's what's supposed to
[33:26] control you
[33:27] not be outwards me right the outward is
[33:30] controlled by just natural things of the
[33:32] world
[33:34] and operates according to that but in
[33:37] that inward being
[33:39] which is the soul of the individual
[33:43] and no matter what
[33:45] whether you're saved or lost
[33:48] that show had a an a connection back to
[33:55] God
[33:56] right amen because God made it right
[33:58] right
[33:59] now he never made
[34:03] he never made every so Eternal We'll get
[34:05] to that Sunday he only done that to Adam
[34:07] and bringing it forward and then Jesus
[34:09] Christ was eternal all right but in the
[34:12] the point of where we're you know the
[34:14] natural looking at it then
[34:18] it wouldn't matter whether you ever
[34:19] heard of God or not right
[34:22] that doesn't have anything to do with it
[34:24] that way
[34:26] it's the fact that by being a creation
[34:32] and being made in the image of our
[34:35] creator
[34:38] and having that god-like ability
[34:44] Creator ability Etc it makes us to where
[34:48] we're conscious of God
[34:50] all right
[34:51] why would he make totem poles it you
[34:54] know why would they make animals images
[34:56] why would they make this image or that
[34:58] image or or whatever you know
[35:01] it's because everybody
[35:04] has
[35:06] you know a person a human
[35:09] a soul amen
[35:11] all right really it doesn't have one
[35:14] that's what you are amen yeah do you
[35:16] just say has a soul and that means this
[35:18] you start trying to tack on this or that
[35:20] or the other or move something about
[35:21] don't it's really what you are right
[35:23] amen see no matter what whether you was
[35:27] raised in a Christian home whether you
[35:29] ever heard of God
[35:32] where you was born as a Hot Tot that
[35:34] never knows you're right or your left
[35:36] hand or whatever
[35:38] they're still of Consciousness part
[35:42] of us that wants the worship God right
[35:46] and I've told you over and over if
[35:49] even when I was a young person
[35:52] I would have never went out and done
[35:54] wrong
[35:55] you know yourself
[35:57] the first drink of liquor you took there
[35:59] was something said don't do it
[36:01] the first cigarette you smoke something
[36:03] said don't do it
[36:06] first time you went out and committed
[36:08] adultery something told you don't do it
[36:12] what was that
[36:14] right
[36:16] what was that
[36:19] that was the real you
[36:22] in a god-like condition
[36:26] I don't know how to say it because see
[36:27] you start talking like that people think
[36:29] you're somebody Eternal I'm not talking
[36:30] about eternal but around me and calls
[36:32] the sinner's Soul immortal
[36:34] Immortal I gave you the quote on them
[36:37] now Immortal to us means what
[36:40] eternal
[36:43] but what did it mean to him when he said
[36:45] that right
[36:47] you didn't mean the sinner's Soul was
[36:49] eternal
[36:51] what's he talking about
[36:52] it's in the image of God
[36:56] there's nothing
[36:58] that man can't do
[37:02] that the only thing he can't do is
[37:04] create
[37:05] yeah
[37:07] but he gets so close to that until he
[37:09] can make a grain of corn it looked just
[37:10] like a grain of corn that's right yeah
[37:14] and it tastes just like it it can have
[37:17] every bit of the same elements that the
[37:19] grain of corn had in it
[37:21] but you just can't plan it and get it to
[37:23] grow that's right
[37:26] but you see my point is I'm trying to
[37:28] get to you
[37:30] even in a fallen estate
[37:32] think back in your life
[37:37] think back in your life when you first
[37:39] done something
[37:40] smoke drink or something first time you
[37:43] started cussing
[37:45] you know cursing excuse me where they'll
[37:48] understand the language
[37:49] we use cut us in the South that's right
[37:55] I always told you I never did use vulgar
[37:58] words
[37:59] you know why I like my teeth
[38:03] I wanted to keep them I've seen a lot of
[38:06] people lose teeth on account of a bad
[38:07] word that's come out of their lips so I
[38:10] figured out one day the best thing to do
[38:12] it just not do that
[38:14] um
[38:16] I tried smoking cigarettes
[38:18] very little nice didn't like it right
[38:22] hot chewing tobacco
[38:25] and I've done pretty good for about a
[38:27] week night
[38:28] and all at once thank God one day I got
[38:32] so sick I couldn't stand it you know I
[38:33] never did chew anymore
[38:36] because I had enough common sense to
[38:39] realize that wasn't doing me no good
[38:42] yeah
[38:42] all people to get liquor come back beer
[38:45] and stuff set them out let them drink it
[38:52] he said we'll run it down you just by
[38:55] the way not
[38:56] ain't no difference the only thing
[38:58] you've done you overrode that first
[38:59] thing I told you not to do it right
[39:01] that's right
[39:02] you want to be honcho mucho big old guy
[39:05] and you want to go out and drink like
[39:06] everybody else and brother rattle had
[39:08] the same problem
[39:09] because when the little girl was handed
[39:12] me the cigarette he liked and smoked it
[39:15] and when they had the liquor out there
[39:17] he was gonna he'd like to a drunket but
[39:19] he didn't do it something spoke to him
[39:21] amen
[39:22] right now
[39:26] he said God dealt with him all of his
[39:29] life but you know he said one day he got
[39:31] born again right amen right yeah
[39:36] he said he can see God in everything
[39:38] that he ever saw
[39:40] you know that was when he was a sinner
[39:43] yep
[39:44] before he got born again
[39:46] and if we just realized it and look
[39:48] around us
[39:50] see the world and what it is today
[39:53] especially the technology as I was
[39:56] trying to save our Sunday
[39:58] to look at it now
[40:00] you can just take a telephone
[40:02] and you can call the other side of the
[40:04] world
[40:09] it's just a Split Second
[40:12] I mean I remember when they used to be
[40:14] that when I would make phone calls to
[40:16] some of these foreign countries and
[40:18] things even Jamaica they'd be a little
[40:20] pause in it you know
[40:22] it wouldn't have been a second or two
[40:24] but now you just they just pick up the
[40:26] phone it's just right there you know
[40:29] how to do that
[40:33] well they got all these wires that runs
[40:36] out across there yeah they got a great
[40:38] big old one they call it monofilament
[40:39] not the word for a great big wire
[40:42] you don't have no wires in it it's the
[40:44] way it's money
[40:45] and you know them phone calls just
[40:47] millions of them is going through them
[40:48] wires
[40:52] and they Crossing each other
[40:54] no
[40:56] how come we just don't get all mixed up
[40:58] and find some guy in China and start
[40:59] talking to him of course you will if you
[41:01] try to call Sears and Roebuck or
[41:03] something
[41:06] is that where they're at
[41:08] right
[41:10] come on you call Sears and robot you
[41:13] call the telephone company that's right
[41:14] right
[41:16] you want to report your telephone
[41:18] you call a power company some guy down
[41:21] in Florida
[41:23] answers the phone
[41:25] or somebody over China
[41:27] I don't know
[41:28] who I got it's just a power company
[41:34] well I thought I was talking to somebody
[41:35] near the states now I'm in China but
[41:37] I'll take care of it and they do
[41:40] now who could ever have thought about
[41:42] something like that being so real right
[41:44] I make a joke out of it because it but
[41:46] it's it's true isn't it it's almost a
[41:49] supernatural world that we're living in
[41:51] amen right I told you brother molting
[41:53] him I was in the end of World War II
[41:56] there in 45 right through there they
[41:59] were even setting in on how to decompose
[42:01] a human being send him to California and
[42:03] put him back together
[42:04] and they could decompose him but they
[42:06] couldn't get him back together that was
[42:08] for trouble
[42:11] the prophet of God said travel like a
[42:13] dollar
[42:14] that's right
[42:17] now what was it that went beyond the
[42:19] curtain of time with him
[42:24] right
[42:27] you look back and seeing his body
[42:28] wiggling laying there on the bed
[42:32] did his soul leave his body has to leave
[42:34] it to where there was no soul or no
[42:37] the supernatural element took place
[42:41] that a man could go beyond the curtain
[42:42] of time
[42:44] the soul
[42:47] but you know I remember
[42:51] when he went to hell and he wasn't born
[42:53] again
[42:54] all right
[42:56] you remember that you seen it's in the
[42:59] quote he said I've been in both places
[43:03] but the one when he went down was before
[43:05] he was born again
[43:09] I'm just saying folks
[43:11] do we really understand what it is to be
[43:15] a human mortal a being
[43:17] that is in the image of God
[43:20] and if it wasn't for God controlling us
[43:25] remote said they had two guys in the
[43:27] school they was in
[43:29] they're just you know we're dealing with
[43:30] the atom bomb and the things and all the
[43:32] different things he said they had to
[43:34] keep close check on those two guys he
[43:35] said God they blow the place up
[43:39] because they were again beginning to be
[43:41] smart about what they were doing what
[43:42] about now right
[43:47] what about to be able to take what's in
[43:49] my hand right here
[43:51] and light the world up
[43:54] because a man is a soul
[44:01] in the image of his God
[44:07] and I gave it to you there
[44:10] I have a few quotes
[44:12] you don't have to read all of them and
[44:13] just scan down and look at them
[44:18] but you see
[44:21] man
[44:24] his soul is a spiritual being
[44:30] it's a being
[44:33] is who you are
[44:37] it's the part of you that God's working
[44:39] on
[44:42] yeah if you look at it you'll see what
[44:44] I'm talking about do you see people that
[44:46] get into a religious Society
[44:49] and you see them start dressing better
[44:51] and doing better and quit doing all
[44:53] these things
[44:54] why
[44:56] but you do every bit of that and still
[44:58] be lost
[45:00] but you can do it because of that Soul
[45:02] that's within you
[45:04] in a contact with its maker begins to
[45:07] cry out
[45:11] that's the real you
[45:15] the only way you can ever get born again
[45:20] is to let that soul of you
[45:23] hear the word
[45:28] you see why it's so important the word
[45:30] be preached correctly
[45:33] how can you bring a new birth from what
[45:35] is not
[45:36] true
[45:40] like a man told me one time he said I
[45:42] took my wife
[45:44] to a Pentecostal Church to get a free in
[45:46] the spirit where she can get the Holy
[45:47] Ghost
[45:49] I'm offended in my own
[45:51] That Could my answer could I give
[45:54] that's your brother you mean to tell me
[45:56] a Pentecostal people which is a whole
[45:57] message behind but knowing more about
[45:59] getting the Holy Ghost to come home to
[46:01] an individual than somebody who is in
[46:04] the message without
[46:07] well you didn't like it
[46:11] but it was true
[46:15] you see you can get all worked up in a
[46:17] spiritual Realm
[46:18] and thank you all you're saved you're
[46:21] just love God and you just so great
[46:27] do you know you can do everybody that
[46:28] still belong right
[46:30] that's what I'm trying to tell you
[46:34] he said well it just sounds like you
[46:35] just don't know what you're talking
[46:37] about because you just jumping I'm
[46:39] trying my best to talk to you and me
[46:44] how do you know you're born again right
[46:46] I believe the prophet will sold us the
[46:48] devil and that way you got on him
[46:55] how many of you seen that was following
[46:57] the prophet
[46:59] and you know now they went by garbage
[47:01] cans around the world on these doctrines
[47:04] right
[47:08] but yet people that maybe even brought
[47:10] you into the message
[47:13] we're a day today
[47:20] do you know you're born again
[47:23] if you don't know what you are how can
[47:24] you know you're born to be
[47:29] if you don't know the difference between
[47:31] your spirit and your soul
[47:34] your problem
[47:41] he said but I love God
[47:43] so does the woman that takes her baby
[47:45] out and features to an alligator
[47:55] but you see what is it
[47:58] what is a soul
[48:02] do we could quote a lot from the prophet
[48:04] but what did you
[48:06] he starts talking all in in a message
[48:09] called question and answers and Genesis
[48:10] number one on your notes 53 729
[48:14] . he's talking about let us make man
[48:15] that who father and son
[48:18] make man their own image people going
[48:20] haywire trying to figure that out
[48:21] because brother Ryan said it was father
[48:23] and son
[48:26] that's not two people
[48:28] the son was the father made manifest in
[48:31] another former
[48:32] but like I tried to preach back younger
[48:35] a long time ago why can't you see that
[48:37] there's a communication gap backwards in
[48:39] between all of these forms
[48:42] you remember that
[48:46] the father and son could talk about how
[48:48] to make a man
[48:50] and that's not two people
[48:55] it was word and spirit
[48:57] is that what your Prophet said
[49:00] word and spirit right
[49:03] coming alive look at it now if a man was
[49:06] made something like that little sacred
[49:08] lot younger or something like that
[49:11] it could not be seen which is a
[49:14] spiritual being
[49:15] he manifested or unfolded himself a
[49:18] little more to make a trinity of himself
[49:20] my father-son only spirit
[49:22] and here was God unfolded himself now
[49:26] down into let us make man which was his
[49:29] son in Offspring from him man in our
[49:32] image he was a supernatural being
[49:35] they don't even have to meet you know
[49:37] the cattles and the field and so forth
[49:41] you said well that Riverdale is only the
[49:45] borned again
[49:47] no it's not
[49:51] every man in the world has created in
[49:53] the image of God right
[49:55] right man or woman agree you're created
[49:57] in the image of God
[50:03] you see why it's so hard to try to
[50:05] preach to you to get it down to you
[50:06] because your mind will run up into
[50:08] something else
[50:09] just stay with me
[50:12] think about your soul and what you are
[50:19] look at the next one this is one we
[50:21] float a lot now I love it and I have for
[50:23] many many years
[50:24] is in the Hebrew Book 1957 8 28.
[50:29] look at the things he calls these this
[50:33] Park
[50:35] now the logos that went out of God which
[50:37] was the the Lord gosh all this began to
[50:39] form into a body shape
[50:44] and this body shape was called in
[50:46] Scholars teaching logos the logos that
[50:48] went out of God in other words a better
[50:50] word for it was a what we call it
[50:52] theophany the acne is a human body
[50:55] that's glorified not exactly with flesh
[50:58] and blood like it will be in this
[50:59] glorified State stage but is it is of a
[51:03] form
[51:05] of a human body that doesn't eat neither
[51:07] does it drink but but it's a body
[51:09] a body that's waiting for us as soon as
[51:12] we leave this one now and there we enter
[51:14] into that body and that's the kind of
[51:17] body that God was for he said let us
[51:19] make manner on image and our likeness
[51:21] and when Mandy came into that body he
[51:24] had control of the fish in the finals of
[51:26] beasts and all going down didn't look
[51:28] down at the department but the
[51:29] difference between explains a man and an
[51:31] animal they're between an animal and a
[51:32] man God put a soul in a man he didn't
[51:35] put an animal because the soul that was
[51:37] in the man is that theophany
[51:41] no
[51:43] there's only one eternal theophany
[51:46] we'll get back to that
[51:49] but a theophany simply means a
[51:52] in other words it's a bodily form
[51:57] all right we're gonna get down into it
[51:58] in a minute and we're going to read
[52:00] where the Prophet is talking about
[52:01] celestials and he's talking about
[52:03] Sinners even having a celestial
[52:07] and he calls the celestial the theophany
[52:09] the Lord gosh
[52:12] the soul
[52:14] so just stay with me down on the point
[52:16] of thinking about us natural
[52:19] see God put something into the man that
[52:22] he didn't put an animal right amen he
[52:25] put us over right
[52:28] I know sin entered the picture yes and
[52:30] it could come down to to where that man
[52:32] was lost yes but just remember it was
[52:35] the soul of God that had to come pay the
[52:37] ransom right
[52:42] the body
[52:44] could pay a price
[52:47] it was a covering
[52:50] because the body couldn't take away sin
[52:52] now come with the Natural Body of the
[52:54] Lord Jesus
[52:56] it was a soul that could pay the price
[53:02] that's when he had to come like he did
[53:06] Hebrews number three on he knows chapter
[53:09] 4.
[53:11] with God a man certainly let us make man
[53:13] their own image what was God a theophany
[53:16] a body
[53:17] and our man was made like that and put
[53:21] Over the Garden but there's no man to
[53:24] tell the soil in the senses then he
[53:27] created man Out of the Dust of the earth
[53:28] like you know an animal
[53:30] I'm glad that theophy come down and was
[53:32] made flesh and dwelt among us to redeem
[53:36] the man
[53:39] listen
[53:42] no matter what you think about
[53:46] you're a person right
[53:51] you're a human
[53:53] you're immoral
[53:57] and that sold us within you
[54:00] is longing for God
[54:05] you put it in the pawn shop you remember
[54:07] that message years ago
[54:10] we blame the devil for putting us in the
[54:12] pawn shop you know we put our own Chef
[54:15] there
[54:16] we sold ourselves to sin you didn't have
[54:19] to do wrong right that's right I didn't
[54:22] drink
[54:23] you didn't have to drink
[54:27] huh
[54:30] why are you just said no just me
[54:33] I couldn't afford it mainly
[54:36] but you can always figure out a way to
[54:37] afford your habit you know afford your
[54:39] habits
[54:42] but you see
[54:45] if we just listen
[54:49] to our shoulder
[54:51] we never went into Rome we went
[54:54] yeah well we can't have it we're I'm
[54:56] going I know
[54:57] I know right we're in Satan's domain
[55:00] sure
[55:02] subject to that
[55:04] but we overrode the Fremont agency that
[55:09] God placed us to where we could make a
[55:11] choice
[55:12] don't blame Adam and Eve that's right
[55:15] well God made me this way now we've done
[55:18] been too much through too many sermons
[55:20] on that right
[55:23] God didn't make you wrong he made you
[55:26] perfect
[55:27] you make Eternal he gave you a perfect
[55:29] soul and a perfect spirit and put it in
[55:32] a body that comes from Mom and Daddy is
[55:34] perfect to that could be made right
[55:39] we
[55:40] reached an age of accountability
[55:44] and we went after that world and it's
[55:47] doing
[55:48] we didn't have to
[55:52] Quincy used to tell me when I come in
[55:53] the message they said well brother Dale
[55:55] what it is the new birth of see I was
[55:57] seeking the new birth
[55:59] they said
[56:00] but when you quit drinking you quit
[56:02] smoking you quit doing those things and
[56:04] I said well that must have been saved
[56:05] all the time
[56:10] because it didn't do it
[56:14] she didn't like that because it
[56:16] destroyed their Doctrine their doctrines
[56:19] was all you got to do is quit smoking
[56:20] drink and chewing that means you're
[56:22] saved
[56:25] I don't mean you're saved right
[56:27] right I mean the alcoholic and almost
[56:29] Anonymous has taken over wow cigarette
[56:32] or non Anonymous has taken over
[56:38] well we just can't see that's what
[56:39] you're saying you're still laying on
[56:41] that old thing that you can't help it
[56:43] right I'm trying to tell you kids you
[56:46] don't have to do wrong
[56:50] those other kids around you are doing
[56:52] wrong you don't have to do it right
[56:54] right well I'll be all right well
[56:57] just beyond amen
[57:01] I never had no trouble with it right
[57:07] they come to me and they talk about
[57:08] their drink I said just get out you
[57:10] leave me alone
[57:12] but they knew I meant it good
[57:16] so just get out of here and leave me
[57:18] alone I don't want to have nothing to do
[57:19] with the junk
[57:21] well if one person could do it another
[57:23] can
[57:25] you see that was not a Christian
[57:28] it was not that I was a Christian no
[57:31] that was before I even joined the
[57:32] Baptist Church
[57:33] I was 18 years old before I even joined
[57:35] a church period you know why because the
[57:38] church is what got in my way
[57:40] the people of the church is what got in
[57:42] my way of them telling me how much they
[57:45] love God and to not watch their lives
[57:48] and you that there was something keeping
[57:50] me from doing those things and they were
[57:52] going out doing it
[57:56] Mike White said they went to that place
[57:57] that time they had to go outside where
[57:59] they could take a smoke break in between
[58:00] the had to have a break in the service
[58:02] to go have a smoke break
[58:06] you see I didn't like it then I told
[58:09] people about it right
[58:11] people came to my house or me and my
[58:13] wife had been married and all they come
[58:15] there and asked me about coming to
[58:15] church I said listen I live a better
[58:17] life than your Deacon board does
[58:19] and but they didn't want me to get
[58:21] started on who was doing what because
[58:24] they knew I could tell them
[58:27] but I said I live a better life than
[58:28] you're a deacon board done and I'm lost
[58:32] you know why that was so because there
[58:35] was a moral obligation of a soul
[58:37] dwelling inside of an individual person
[58:41] when I was 11 years old I saw God in
[58:44] that church
[58:46] that didn't save me I just saw him and I
[58:48] knew he was real
[58:51] and by knowing it was real I wanted
[58:53] somebody to be able to do his jokes and
[58:55] take my hand in the hand of God and
[58:58] bring us together
[59:01] you couldn't do it
[59:05] but you see it was when I lost
[59:08] the things that happens to what most
[59:10] people call Christianity that happened
[59:12] to me when I was lost
[59:14] well you're just an an hour you just you
[59:18] know you like to brag I'm not bragging
[59:21] they don't break into it
[59:24] I'll take you down at home let you get
[59:26] out and walk the streets talk to anybody
[59:28] you want to
[59:30] and you'll find out what I told you is
[59:32] the truth
[59:36] the only time they ever threatened to
[59:37] whoop anybody was three of them at one
[59:38] time because they went off and told I
[59:40] was drunk
[59:41] I said get out here one at the time or
[59:43] all three of you don't make no
[59:44] difference to me because you ain't gonna
[59:45] go tell that because I don't do it
[59:51] was a conscience part of me
[59:55] I've tried to explain something to you
[59:58] I'm not bragging about a person like
[1:00:00] this I wouldn't have shared that's why I
[1:00:02] called myself the chief is the sinners
[1:00:07] why because I want that life of trying
[1:00:10] to be straight
[1:00:12] sure I had my problems
[1:00:18] but I found God
[1:00:22] that's all I've ever tried to get you to
[1:00:24] do
[1:00:26] this is just stop long enough to let God
[1:00:28] catch up with you but you're trying to
[1:00:30] be too spiritual
[1:00:32] right
[1:00:34] you're trying to save yourself and you
[1:00:36] can't do it
[1:00:38] realizing salvation is of God
[1:00:41] amen
[1:00:43] and accepted on that basis and said God
[1:00:45] Take Me As I Am and do something with me
[1:00:49] I don't want to do these other things
[1:00:51] you children you don't have to go out
[1:00:53] there and do those things
[1:00:55] amen in one day you'll find out that
[1:00:58] those Brothers around you that used to
[1:01:00] like and make fun of you they'll come
[1:01:02] and honor you for what you've done
[1:01:05] right when I see you really mean it
[1:01:08] 'll come to you when they need help
[1:01:13] but you understand I'm just trying to
[1:01:15] explain a human mortal
[1:01:21] that that human
[1:01:24] difference between you and an animal
[1:01:26] is that Soul that's within you amen
[1:01:30] amen the center part of you
[1:01:35] but see it was so deceiving in mankind
[1:01:37] until I told you it took the prophet now
[1:01:40] he would interlace it backwards and
[1:01:41] forth in the older parts of the message
[1:01:43] but up until 62 basically he taught it
[1:01:47] body
[1:01:49] Soul spirit
[1:01:55] but then when that word began to open
[1:01:57] unto him he saw it he taught his body
[1:01:59] spirit and soul
[1:02:02] but he had his senses correct
[1:02:05] he didn't have to go back and repreach
[1:02:07] it right he always give the outside the
[1:02:10] body five senses CJ still smelling here
[1:02:13] he always gave the second rim of man
[1:02:15] whether he called it Soul or Spirit
[1:02:18] right
[1:02:21] he gave him
[1:02:23] five senses memory reason conscience Etc
[1:02:28] but he said there's only one
[1:02:31] it's either Faith or doubt he's in the
[1:02:34] soul yep you're either born again or
[1:02:37] you're lost
[1:02:41] but just remember
[1:02:44] those demons that fail the prophet said
[1:02:47] they couldn't be like they caught you
[1:02:49] know in mankind that they press
[1:02:51] themselves into human flesh now I was
[1:02:53] looking at it today he said that can't
[1:02:54] be so
[1:02:56] because that would make him create
[1:02:57] orders
[1:02:59] but he said they can
[1:03:01] press themselves into you and pervert
[1:03:04] your nature
[1:03:08] and that's exactly what we've done we
[1:03:10] allowed it to take place
[1:03:14] I've never talked to a person yet that
[1:03:17] ever drank beer that ever liked the
[1:03:19] first taste of it have you
[1:03:25] none of you have ever told me you like
[1:03:26] beer in your first stages you always
[1:03:28] said you had to learn to taste of stuff
[1:03:32] why did you learn
[1:03:37] oh I want to be like the red
[1:03:40] that's that devil that's in demons
[1:03:43] precious and giving us those nature and
[1:03:45] perverting that soul
[1:03:48] making that Soul follower after his ways
[1:03:54] don't worry about it it's bad enough
[1:03:55] like it is do the best you can you never
[1:03:58] smoke you never drink you never chew you
[1:04:00] know don't worry about you're still lost
[1:04:05] but that's where the trouble is so you
[1:04:07] think you're saved
[1:04:09] you think you're saved because you quit
[1:04:11] doing something
[1:04:13] when I go to church and I love this
[1:04:15] message the devil will beat you here you
[1:04:18] hear a whole lot more than any of us
[1:04:23] he's not out there in that bar fly junk
[1:04:25] along there with a garbage can he don't
[1:04:28] even like it out there that's right
[1:04:30] drunks and vomiting and all the junk he
[1:04:33] don't like it out there
[1:04:34] he wants to come to church why because
[1:04:36] he was young
[1:04:37] the Americans Stood Beside the Lord he
[1:04:39] loves worship right right
[1:04:42] that's right
[1:04:44] he loves to hear good music he loves to
[1:04:46] sing and praise God
[1:04:49] because he was the anointed Church
[1:04:52] we think of him the big old guy with the
[1:04:54] horns you know he got another porch
[1:04:56] pitch for it you know
[1:05:03] if you're listening to the message
[1:05:07] now you watch what I'm saying I'm sorry
[1:05:09] just trying to get a point to you but
[1:05:11] see the devil follows you
[1:05:13] right I told her brother this years ago
[1:05:16] I said you got on one Doctrine and you
[1:05:18] went around and around brother
[1:05:21] and I said had you got off that doctor
[1:05:23] and went to other places and preached
[1:05:24] other things Satan couldn't have caught
[1:05:26] up with you and I said you went around
[1:05:28] and around on one Doctrine unless he got
[1:05:31] on the track with you and he caught up
[1:05:32] when he took you to the bed of adultery
[1:05:34] which he did he took him to the bed with
[1:05:36] a young girl
[1:05:39] his Doctrine took him to a bed with a
[1:05:42] young girl
[1:05:44] because he had a dream that he had a
[1:05:46] seed to plant his wife was already
[1:05:47] through menopause
[1:05:49] and he knew she couldn't plant it her it
[1:05:51] wouldn't do any good he taught I said
[1:05:52] brother can't you understand preaching
[1:05:54] the gospel is planting a seed you God
[1:05:56] was trying to tell you to preach the
[1:05:58] gospel
[1:06:02] he thought he was right
[1:06:07] he never did say he was wrong
[1:06:11] he never did
[1:06:13] I love the old man
[1:06:15] he was my friend
[1:06:18] but listen
[1:06:21] the devil get on that line with you
[1:06:23] you look where it's taken because that's
[1:06:25] what Satan does
[1:06:28] a man starts preaching a doctor and you
[1:06:30] watch him
[1:06:31] he stays on that one Doctrine Two Souls
[1:06:33] except another virtue proves him real
[1:06:35] Jordan whatever he gets on that one
[1:06:36] doctor and he just stays on it stays on
[1:06:38] it and stays on it and that's all you
[1:06:40] ever hear
[1:06:43] you showed me and one of them hadn't
[1:06:44] wound up in adultery yet not a name name
[1:06:46] so you go ahead tell me one it happened
[1:06:50] and all nine names it has
[1:06:52] because every one of them that was the
[1:06:54] founder of those doctrines as far as I
[1:06:57] know almost to the full 100 of every one
[1:06:59] of them wind up in adultery
[1:07:01] you know why
[1:07:03] because Satan got run on with him and
[1:07:06] made them enjoy it and have a good time
[1:07:07] oh wonderful Doctrine everybody was so
[1:07:10] happy it's glorious and going you know
[1:07:15] why because we're a soul of people
[1:07:19] your soul and China you've learned year
[1:07:22] yearns for God you got to convert it to
[1:07:24] the nature of following the devil in his
[1:07:26] ways
[1:07:28] it desires after God
[1:07:30] even in the Fallen estate you still
[1:07:32] don't want to do the things you do
[1:07:36] if you do there's something wrong with
[1:07:38] you
[1:07:40] you know better than to do the things
[1:07:44] but yet we're just going to do them
[1:07:45] anyway
[1:07:48] right
[1:07:52] but you see I'm not gonna get the
[1:07:54] message part so we just get on over you
[1:07:57] can flip over along in the message
[1:07:58] somewhere in there and you'll find out
[1:07:59] that run around and start talking about
[1:08:01] a theophany and he starts to start
[1:08:03] talking about a terrestrial a celestial
[1:08:09] because you have two bodies
[1:08:13] do you understand what I mean two bodies
[1:08:14] one of them is your natural body the
[1:08:17] other one is whatever is controlling you
[1:08:19] the prophet said it's either got an
[1:08:22] upward pull to it or a downward pool and
[1:08:26] he said you're naturally born with it
[1:08:28] going downward
[1:08:30] but it's still called a celestial
[1:08:32] a soul
[1:08:34] a pool
[1:08:38] According to which one we follow
[1:08:43] Jesus celestial
[1:08:47] a Heavenly Body
[1:08:51] look at number 10 there's nothing else
[1:08:52] on your nose
[1:08:56] questions and answers 1954.
[1:09:00] 103.
[1:09:04] an evening service you cannot be here a
[1:09:06] spiritual being a sinner or saint
[1:09:10] or Saint did everybody find it number
[1:09:12] 10.
[1:09:14] you cannot be here a spiritual being
[1:09:18] sinner or Saint without having an
[1:09:21] influence from the underworld or from
[1:09:23] the above world
[1:09:25] if you're influenced from here
[1:09:28] you're from above so evidently let's
[1:09:30] have pointed upward or something
[1:09:32] your Celestial body is waiting up dark
[1:09:36] but if you're Wicked and hypocritical
[1:09:38] and different your Celestial body is
[1:09:40] down here regardless of how much you
[1:09:43] think it's up there because the fruit
[1:09:46] that you buy before people proves where
[1:09:49] you're from
[1:09:53] so Center has a Celestial body right
[1:09:56] right what not an eternal theophany
[1:09:58] glorified condition no
[1:10:01] it's your soul it's your being
[1:10:06] Who You Are
[1:10:12] and it's the one that's controlling us
[1:10:15] one goes upward nothing goes downward
[1:10:21] because look where your Prophet tells it
[1:10:23] that you had to go look at entombment 57
[1:10:27] 420. number 11 on your nose and here he
[1:10:30] goes
[1:10:31] where did he leave when he left the
[1:10:33] Bible said he ascended he went and
[1:10:36] preached to the souls that were in
[1:10:38] prison
[1:10:40] now these are not born again Christians
[1:10:42] right
[1:10:44] I know what the Bible says it's called a
[1:10:46] spirit that was in prison but when your
[1:10:49] Prophet comes in he called it souls in
[1:10:51] prison and the angel of the Lord
[1:10:52] verified it beyond the curtain of time
[1:10:55] see what
[1:10:57] he went and preached to the souls that
[1:10:59] were in prison that repented not into
[1:11:00] long-suffering of days of Noah his soul
[1:11:03] his Spirit his theophany of his own
[1:11:06] being went down let's follow him would
[1:11:09] you like
[1:11:10] would you like tonight to follow him a
[1:11:12] few minutes let's see where he went just
[1:11:15] below the regions of mortal being Blaze
[1:11:17] the realm of demon power below that just
[1:11:21] above that laser shoulder the unjust
[1:11:23] below it lays the very
[1:11:27] domain of Satan hell
[1:11:30] then just above us lays the Holy Spirit
[1:11:34] then under the altar lays The Souls of
[1:11:37] just men the next is God himself one
[1:11:40] going downward one going up where the
[1:11:42] two Spirits are here on Earth today
[1:11:43] influences the people of this Earth
[1:11:46] time
[1:11:48] which is
[1:11:51] which one's doing
[1:11:54] sold in prison 1963 11-10 he's talking
[1:11:58] about both places he said by the grace
[1:11:59] of God I say it not to be sacrilegious
[1:12:02] and if if it's wrong God forgive me I
[1:12:04] believe I've been in both places see in
[1:12:07] both places I've seen the redeemed and
[1:12:09] the blessed and I've seen the lost and
[1:12:10] where they were at and that's why I
[1:12:13] stand as your brother today to warn you
[1:12:15] to flee from that downward path don't
[1:12:17] you never go that road
[1:12:21] downward path
[1:12:23] both places
[1:12:25] what did he see when he went beyond the
[1:12:27] curtain of time
[1:12:28] we'll get to it Sunday the prophet the
[1:12:30] angel Lord referred to it as sold under
[1:12:32] the altar sold he didn't say Spirits so
[1:12:35] much
[1:12:36] amen
[1:12:37] sold under the altar is okay as long as
[1:12:40] you don't say how long how long to
[1:12:41] avenge our blood that's fifth seals you
[1:12:43] don't get it all tied up together
[1:12:46] Souls under the altar is wonderful
[1:12:48] because that's where we're going
[1:12:50] it's the soul
[1:12:53] that's redeemed
[1:12:55] page 49 in the future home he said their
[1:12:58] shoulders redeemed said we're waiting
[1:12:59] the Redemption of the body right
[1:13:01] shows
[1:13:03] he said I've been in both places he's
[1:13:05] talking about it the souls in prison
[1:13:08] did he preach to those Souls that were
[1:13:11] unsavable
[1:13:15] now what did Jesus go preach to when he
[1:13:17] went down Souls that were unsavable
[1:13:21] people that had died and went on
[1:13:25] right amen amen you were worthy they
[1:13:28] were in their soul
[1:13:30] their Celestial beings their soul
[1:13:34] now we're not just Spirits running
[1:13:36] around because they were Souls
[1:13:39] wrote around him even describes it to
[1:13:42] where did he seen the women coming up
[1:13:43] with their painted faces and their their
[1:13:46] new engineer clothes right
[1:13:49] so if there's something motivating you
[1:13:52] to change that and start making in and
[1:13:54] painting your face and things then
[1:13:55] you're going to realize that that's got
[1:13:57] to be a demon that's not the Holy Spirit
[1:14:00] or you've got warpaint on one because
[1:14:02] you're trying to
[1:14:05] okay
[1:14:08] but listen folks just get the point
[1:14:13] of what I'm trying to say
[1:14:17] being a human being
[1:14:20] makes us want to serve God
[1:14:23] don't get that confused with the fact of
[1:14:26] the new birth
[1:14:28] brother Dan what was you any different
[1:14:30] when you received the Holy Ghost not a
[1:14:32] thing in the world out here
[1:14:34] I didn't have to quit anything I'd
[1:14:36] already quit
[1:14:38] I didn't know how to start lying and
[1:14:41] cheating I did not cheat
[1:14:43] I didn't have to quit committing
[1:14:45] adultery because I quit all that junk
[1:14:48] I didn't have to quit drinking I didn't
[1:14:50] have to quit smoking I didn't quit all
[1:14:52] that while I was a sinner
[1:14:57] right but you see I know I would not
[1:15:00] saying because when I heard this Prophet
[1:15:01] talking about my brother Mo started
[1:15:03] talking to me
[1:15:05] I thought I had it yeah
[1:15:07] but when I heard this Prophet began to
[1:15:09] describe
[1:15:10] a human mortal
[1:15:14] and what he was
[1:15:17] how did he even wanted to serve God
[1:15:20] right
[1:15:21] I would long in his heart David crying
[1:15:25] out
[1:15:25] my soul purses after thee oh God
[1:15:33] but there's no Holy Ghost to be able to
[1:15:34] get in right
[1:15:37] but his soul cursed it
[1:15:40] he didn't want to do wrong
[1:15:43] the prophet of God says on his way home
[1:15:46] from the bed with Bathsheba he cried out
[1:15:49] return unto me the joy of thy salvation
[1:15:53] amen
[1:15:57] from God loved David
[1:16:00] because David had a shoulder that he
[1:16:02] could deal with
[1:16:07] David realized God had chose him to be
[1:16:10] king he was right there in that to walk
[1:16:13] as much as he could
[1:16:15] but yet he made a lot of mistakes
[1:16:19] but yet he called his own judgment when
[1:16:21] Nathan come to him and told him you know
[1:16:24] about the story David said and killed a
[1:16:27] man he said David you're the man he said
[1:16:29] but you won't die because God has told
[1:16:32] me you won't
[1:16:34] it was supposed to be in death to David
[1:16:36] it didn't matter for him being king or
[1:16:38] whether he's high priest or who he was
[1:16:41] adultery was adultery
[1:16:44] but he said David
[1:16:46] the son that you bore will not live
[1:16:52] it will be removed from you
[1:16:55] it was
[1:16:59] go back in the Old Testament and read
[1:17:02] those prophets and how they desired God
[1:17:07] do that just just read some go read the
[1:17:10] psalmist
[1:17:11] I love to read the song If you ever get
[1:17:13] down and out read the song
[1:17:15] man
[1:17:19] look at job
[1:17:21] don't worry the Book of Job and see how
[1:17:23] wonderful and he called out to God he
[1:17:26] desired God and he wanted to walk in a
[1:17:28] straight life
[1:17:33] it was never said that job had anything
[1:17:35] wrong with him right right
[1:17:37] they accused him of being a secret
[1:17:39] Center but they couldn't bring out the
[1:17:41] secrets right right right because there
[1:17:44] was no secrets
[1:17:45] he said in other words exposed me and
[1:17:48] show me what I am
[1:17:49] tell me where I've done it I made this
[1:17:52] sacrifice that he said for me to do
[1:17:55] go back there and study Those Old
[1:17:57] Testament prophets and those people and
[1:17:59] how they longed after God that's right
[1:18:05] now they spent their life trying to
[1:18:06] serve a God but yet never had that God
[1:18:09] dwelling within them
[1:18:13] to a man like Moses
[1:18:17] it could have been ruler of Egypt
[1:18:20] and that's all he had to do was remain
[1:18:22] where he was and take over right
[1:18:25] he would have been the ruler of Egypt
[1:18:27] because he already was
[1:18:34] the yeti sacrificed all of that
[1:18:38] to try to find what was dealing with him
[1:18:41] in his heart
[1:18:48] think about man
[1:18:52] can't you think about when he was a
[1:18:54] child and
[1:18:55] how he was doing and how that something
[1:18:57] was trying to guide you and take care of
[1:18:59] you
[1:19:06] because it was that being of you pet
[1:19:09] body
[1:19:13] them people in hell would lend a body
[1:19:19] he said well what did they look like
[1:19:20] brother they'll see that's where we want
[1:19:22] to go to all that junk
[1:19:27] forgive me for calling junk when I call
[1:19:29] it like that
[1:19:30] but you see when you start talking well
[1:19:32] what kind of a body was that in
[1:19:34] was it old or was it Young
[1:19:38] why does it matter
[1:19:44] the only thing I know brother Ryan said
[1:19:46] if Santa will stand and be judged in the
[1:19:48] body he's sinned in
[1:19:49] and I personally tell you I don't
[1:19:51] believe he's going to be raised 18 years
[1:19:53] old
[1:19:54] now that's my personal opinion you can't
[1:19:56] find where the Prophet ever said if
[1:19:58] that's mine
[1:20:00] because why would God raise him in an 18
[1:20:02] year old body and then destroy it
[1:20:04] now they'll come up in the body they see
[1:20:06] and then and they'll be old and
[1:20:07] dilapidated and gone why because they're
[1:20:10] going to the garbage can right
[1:20:17] but you see
[1:20:20] Jesus went to hell
[1:20:25] and preached
[1:20:29] to people
[1:20:33] what God's bodies and people said what
[1:20:38] help
[1:20:40] would it matter what you could find out
[1:20:41] in the 18 elements that are instead of
[1:20:43] 16 here
[1:20:46] you know what I'm talking about forget
[1:20:49] that
[1:20:50] get out of innovation it's true God had
[1:20:53] to go to hell and preach to those Souls
[1:20:55] that was in prison you know what he
[1:20:58] preached to him they had to be able to
[1:20:59] hear
[1:21:00] man
[1:21:03] right they were their in their Celestial
[1:21:07] form their soul their being their body
[1:21:11] their natural bodies decayed upon the
[1:21:14] world and all of that
[1:21:16] yeah they were living dark
[1:21:18] in a torment
[1:21:21] brother round said it was a constant
[1:21:23] falling
[1:21:27] he said there was no burning
[1:21:30] when the fire burning he said that has
[1:21:32] been a pleasure
[1:21:38] you see what I'm talking about
[1:21:42] see inside of you right now is one way
[1:21:45] or the other right there is either a
[1:21:48] body that's taking you upward or there
[1:21:50] is a body that's taking you downward
[1:21:52] that body is your soul
[1:21:56] that's what's going to live after this
[1:21:58] body is destroyed
[1:22:00] somewhere
[1:22:03] if it's lost it'll be in the Realms of
[1:22:06] the Lost
[1:22:10] if it's saved
[1:22:12] it'll be in glory
[1:22:15] that's right
[1:22:16] but what are we
[1:22:18] what if man the Dark Minds will love him
[1:22:21] remember something
[1:22:22] right see we only want to go to the next
[1:22:24] part or the son of man see we want to
[1:22:27] jump over to something else
[1:22:28] we want to try to become spiritual
[1:22:34] how can you find out how you're saved if
[1:22:36] you don't know what you are
[1:22:38] right that's right how can you know
[1:22:41] whether you're saved or not if you don't
[1:22:42] know what you are that's right all right
[1:22:45] it'd be a good thing to just go home and
[1:22:48] sit down and look in the mirror and say
[1:22:49] God what am I
[1:22:54] I faked this thing long enough trying to
[1:22:56] make this that and the other come and
[1:22:59] speak to me right
[1:23:02] tell me where I am right
[1:23:07] but you see that's what people has done
[1:23:09] on a lot of bases and they come out of
[1:23:11] it saying oh I love God so I must be
[1:23:13] right
[1:23:15] you love with your spirit that's right
[1:23:18] that's the second round
[1:23:20] all right
[1:23:21] your soul is either Faith or doubt
[1:23:27] do you understand what I'm getting now
[1:23:32] do we really know what we are
[1:23:36] and do you really know whether you're
[1:23:37] born again or not that's right
[1:23:44] or we like the badges
[1:23:46] bless God you can't tell me and I've
[1:23:48] talked to people who said that you can't
[1:23:50] tell me I ain't saved I believe this
[1:23:53] prophet's message and I love the
[1:23:56] prophet's family and he said everybody
[1:23:58] that loved his family is going to be
[1:23:59] there
[1:24:01] but I'm gonna be there because I love
[1:24:03] his family
[1:24:11] get into a lot of things yeah
[1:24:14] like the people of this message you've
[1:24:17] always got me
[1:24:20] do you know that there was plenty of
[1:24:21] people believe brother random was God
[1:24:24] while he was here
[1:24:26] while he was traveling about the country
[1:24:28] to preach
[1:24:30] and you know they bought the cheapest
[1:24:31] tape recorders and all kind of things
[1:24:33] that could be brought
[1:24:38] don't tell me that junk
[1:24:40] if I to believe brother Branham was God
[1:24:42] if I believe brother dick was God every
[1:24:44] move he made I'd have the best that the
[1:24:46] world could be I had a big bar and steel
[1:24:48] to get everything I could get to make
[1:24:50] him to where that he even whispered and
[1:24:53] wanted something he didn't have it
[1:24:55] and I'd have the best Machinery in the
[1:24:58] world to take pictures of him and keep
[1:25:00] record of him if I believed him to be
[1:25:02] God
[1:25:05] and a brother named Lawrence one
[1:25:07] time had happened to have a
[1:25:09] battery-powered tape recorder
[1:25:11] the old 7 8 reel
[1:25:14] and out of all of their equipment they
[1:25:16] had they couldn't get nothing to work
[1:25:17] and I used to know the message that it
[1:25:20] was on but he was the only one that got
[1:25:23] a copy of that message that day
[1:25:26] do you understand what I mean
[1:25:31] if I believe today that brother Brown
[1:25:33] was almighty God
[1:25:34] what would it matter to me whether I
[1:25:36] said bag barred or stole I'd have a copy
[1:25:39] of brother Brown's message in every
[1:25:41] person's hand in the world
[1:25:46] if I believed he was God
[1:25:51] don't you see
[1:25:52] we make a lot of garbage cans out of our
[1:25:55] mouth don't be bad big words
[1:25:58] right
[1:26:02] of course he winds up like it did with
[1:26:04] that you know a lot of them believed he
[1:26:05] was God
[1:26:07] until he passed away
[1:26:09] when he passed away they got him another
[1:26:11] one so they made jewels of God
[1:26:14] in other words where God passed away so
[1:26:15] I had to give him another God
[1:26:19] oh we love it we just love it
[1:26:25] do you know whether you're saved or no
[1:26:27] that's it on what basis do you put your
[1:26:30] salvation
[1:26:34] I've walked 40 something years in this
[1:26:36] message so don't talk to me about that
[1:26:39] when you just love the people that
[1:26:40] brought us into this message are no
[1:26:42] longer here it's not because they're
[1:26:43] dead a lot of them ain't
[1:26:51] you know that's true
[1:26:58] see what is man the dark mindfulness
[1:27:03] why did God choose you and I as I was
[1:27:05] trying to get across Sunday what do you
[1:27:06] choose us for that's right
[1:27:08] the monkeys would have been better home
[1:27:12] the monkeys would have served him a
[1:27:14] whole lot better
[1:27:20] no he chose us
[1:27:23] he may have seen his life it's his end
[1:27:28] and even in a fallen estate we're
[1:27:30] creators
[1:27:32] amen
[1:27:35] even just as a moral human being we're
[1:27:37] it's there's nothing can be withholden
[1:27:40] from us and what we can actually do
[1:27:41] right amen
[1:27:49] he's reading not too long ago about just
[1:27:51] troops they've got now that can run 24
[1:27:53] hours a day
[1:27:57] they're so trained
[1:28:00] until they're almost totally inhuman
[1:28:07] you see I read also of an old Indian
[1:28:09] years ago
[1:28:10] was eat up with arthritis
[1:28:13] need to run 15 miles a day and they
[1:28:15] could never capture him
[1:28:21] we make fun of these people like that of
[1:28:23] the Indians worshiping a a God or
[1:28:26] something
[1:28:30] and a lot of those old one like a
[1:28:32] Geronimo on them had visions and things
[1:28:36] why they couldn't capture
[1:28:40] Cochise and those men a lot of them was
[1:28:43] more in contact with God than all of
[1:28:45] those the super religious people that we
