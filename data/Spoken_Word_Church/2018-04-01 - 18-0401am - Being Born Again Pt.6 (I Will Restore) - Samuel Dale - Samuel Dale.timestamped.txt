[7:17] to minister your word that you would
[7:19] come on the scene and speak to the
[7:21] hearts of the people Lord you've already
[7:24] spoke to our heart as to what to say but
[7:26] yet still we need to wait to say and to
[7:29] speak what you have given us to bring to
[7:31] the people we pray that you'd bless and

[7:51] we really appreciate more than Easter
[7:53] time because we firmly believe in a
[7:56] resurrection and Lord we thank you that
[7:58] resurrection is in our heart and it's
[8:02] not just a physical part it did happen
[8:04] there but that didn't do all the holds
[8:07] thing if you had not to come back onto
[8:09] that Pentecost
[8:10] then the resurrection would have been
[8:13] useless yet you came back to live in the
[8:16] hearts of the people we love you and we
[8:18] thank you in Jesus name Amen we've been
[8:25] reading in Peter so we'll go with our to
[8:29] the first Peter 1:18 for as much as you
[8:34] know you were not redeemed with
[8:37] corruptible things as silver and gold
[8:40] from your vain conversation received by
[8:43] tradition from your father's with the
[8:46] precious blood of Christ as of a lamb
[8:47] without blemish and without spot who was
[8:50] fairly very very overly was ordained
[8:56] before the foundation of the world but
[8:59] was manifest to us in these last times
[9:01] for you in other words it's this day
[9:03] manifest in this last day who by him do
[9:06] believe in God that raised him up from
[9:09] the dead and gave him glory and your
[9:11] faith and hope might be in God seeing
[9:14] you have purified your souls and obeying
[9:16] the truth through the spirit unto
[9:17] unfeigned
[9:18] love of the Brethren so that you love
[9:21] one another with a pure heart fervently
[9:23] being born again not a corruptible seed
[9:26] but of incorruptible by the Word of God
[9:29] which liveth and abideth for ever now
[9:32] we're going to jaw will go to jaw to but
[9:37] I want to read Joel 1 for I didn't give
[9:39] this to him now but I want to read it to
[9:42] word it'll be on and then you'll see
[9:44] Lane says Joel - Joel one-in-four says
[9:47] that which the pommel worm has left at
[9:50] the locusts a eaten and that which the
[9:54] locusts have hath left half the
[9:56] cankerworm eaten and that which the
[9:59] cankerworm hath left half the
[10:01] caterpillar
[10:02] eaten all right now we go to verse 23 of
[10:06] the second chapter Nevadan rejoice ye
[10:10] children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord
[10:12] your God for yet giving you the former
[10:15] rain moderately and he will cause to
[10:17] come down for you the rain the former
[10:20] rain and the latter rain in the first
[10:22] month and the floor shall be full of
[10:25] wheat and the fats and I thought I can
[10:28] give them this I just left a part off
[10:30] our floor shall be full of wheat and the
[10:32] facts shall overflow with wine and oil
[10:34] and I will restore to you the years that
[10:38] the locust now remember the locusts what
[10:40] one left the other one ate well there's
[10:42] some left that one ate until he was 8
[10:45] down to the stomach now but remember it
[10:48] was not destroyed it was 8 to the stump
[10:53] all right then he said I will restore to
[10:56] you the years that the locusts have
[10:59] eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar
[11:02] and the palma were my great army which I
[11:05] sent among you you may be seated the
[11:08] Lord had his blessing to the reading of
[11:11] the word now don't get confused are
[11:13] where it says in my great army that I
[11:17] sent among you and that looks like that
[11:20] he literally done this and sent this and
[11:25] that no he permitted it to take place he
[11:28] didn't send it of his own that's not his
[11:31] army that came
[11:32] Wurmple Wurm locals caterpillar that's
[11:34] not the army of God it was what he
[11:37] permitted to come into being to be able
[11:42] to talk about the restoration we'll get
[11:44] to that later on in the message if we
[11:46] have time all right
[11:49] but now I'm trying to get to a position
[11:52] and what I'm doing is cutting out about
[11:55] four sermons that I'm going to try to
[11:58] get in this one today and then we'll
[12:00] start some more later but I want to
[12:04] instead of tying tying your thinking up
[12:07] into a lot of messages I want to try to
[12:09] put it all into one and just kind of run
[12:12] through a little bit to begin with and
[12:15] then you know we'll see how it fits and
[12:20] how things goes together all right
[12:22] because we've got up to the day of
[12:24] Pentecost we've got up to the point of
[12:27] the new birth in studying the new birth
[12:30] and we've got there to find out that the
[12:32] new birth the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[12:35] and the being born again is the one in
[12:38] the same it is your experience that you
[12:42] travel through and then you come out to
[12:46] a place to were that we are beginning to
[12:50] get a foundation to speak about the
[12:53] stature of a perfect man all right let's
[12:56] see now you've got to go through
[12:57] justification sanctification the baptism
[13:01] of the Holy Ghost brings you to the new
[13:04] birth all right now once you receive the
[13:06] new birth then you receive the new birth
[13:10] that that we read and talk about it and
[13:12] we'll go back over it again in second
[13:16] Peter worded it talks about to them of
[13:18] like precious faith all right now that
[13:23] person is Peter was addressing it to
[13:26] them that were born again God is not
[13:29] addressed to the world all right and he
[13:31] says those of like precious faith I
[13:33] would that you still would listen to or
[13:36] read the statute of a perfect man to get
[13:40] a better understanding and listen very
[13:42] carefully to his whole we did last night
[13:46] listen very carefully to the plan that
[13:50] he's talking about trying to get us to
[13:53] see out or what God wants for you and I
[13:59] in this day all right and how he wants
[14:03] us to make manifest that which we see
[14:07] okay all right because now what we're
[14:09] going to dealing with here today is I
[14:13] will restore our restoration we talked
[14:17] about revelation brings restoration
[14:22] alright now we know that mankind you
[14:27] know the the the baptism with Holy Ghost
[14:30] came onto their Pentecost okay that was
[14:34] a revelation of Jesus Christ personally
[14:36] to us or to them or whenever we receive
[14:39] it
[14:39] it's to us which is the new birth all
[14:42] right then you're developing into each
[14:45] one now I've always tried to make it a
[14:49] point to you to try to keep you ahead a
[14:54] little now I believe the new birth is is
[15:00] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[15:03] the born-again experience is one of the
[15:04] same all right see then your new birth
[15:07] is brought to you in stages the being
[15:11] born again is brought to you in stages
[15:14] alright and the baptism of the Holy
[15:16] Ghost is being brought to you in stage
[15:18] you see that's that's what you need to
[15:20] listen to the Prophet that what he's
[15:23] wanting us to attain unto is to
[15:27] something that was already dire because
[15:30] you cannot deal with restoration on
[15:34] something that's not been previously
[15:37] brought all right now so then listen to
[15:41] what I'm saying for a minute and then
[15:43] we'll back up on it in another message
[15:45] or to see the seals is not restoration
[15:49] because the seals were never here now
[15:53] sirrah they were written in Matthew 24
[15:54] we'd never preached by mankind never
[15:56] brought into being it was waiting till
[15:59] the last days all right
[16:01] see then that's not restoration because
[16:05] they were not here the revelation of the
[16:08] faith of the fathers is restoration
[16:11] that's why there's so much everything
[16:13] you listened to brother Branham when he
[16:15] gets into it and he keeps hammering back
[16:18] to the faith of the fathers because
[16:22] that's what you're dealing with
[16:25] restoration all right now you're not
[16:28] dealing with the new birth as
[16:32] restoration
[16:35] the new birth is not restoration the new
[16:37] birth is of Earth remember the point
[16:41] restoration means whatever it is has
[16:44] previously been there and you can talk
[16:46] about eternal life bend iron in coming
[16:48] down to you glory we got that but just
[16:50] get the point of what I'm trying to
[16:52] bring me the church started on the day
[16:56] of Pentecost with the new birth that was
[16:59] not restoration me it wasn't restoration
[17:04] you'd say well they felt we fell from
[17:06] all right that's all back in the mind of
[17:08] God and everything but we're on earth
[17:09] we're not dealing back before the
[17:11] foundation of the world stay down here
[17:13] on earth with us and let's talk about it
[17:14] don't be so heavenly minded until you
[17:17] can't be with any earthly sense or vice
[17:19] versa you know keep it all in the right
[17:22] order to understand alright that's what
[17:25] I'm saying now so when we talk about it
[17:27] and I mentioned faith of the fathers and
[17:30] I keep laying on faith of the father's I
[17:32] want you to realize what I'm talking
[17:34] about
[17:35] alright the faith of the father's is the
[17:38] restoration because that was what was in
[17:42] the early church that's why there's
[17:44] probably five messages there that I
[17:46] should bring to try to show what was
[17:49] there and what it is we'll pick that up
[17:51] as we go into our day all right
[17:57] so you talk about what's back dars
[17:59] wonderful and great all right but we
[18:01] want restoration were in our day all
[18:07] right now so that's what I'm saying I'm
[18:09] trying to cut short some messages to get
[18:12] you to think about it but to think about
[18:14] what it is that we're talking about
[18:17] restoration as to be dealing with what
[18:21] was here before lost went away and then
[18:26] has to be restored
[18:28] now what's that in a minute Reformation
[18:32] is not restoration why would why would
[18:37] brother random where long as the wanders
[18:38] the world called Lutheran Wesley now
[18:42] they take with Luther and Wesley brother
[18:43] and take Luther Wesley and he'd even
[18:45] bring it to Pentecost why don't they
[18:47] call reform when was that called reform
[18:57] to the new birth at Luther received was
[19:00] not restoration cuz the new birth was
[19:04] never ate eating away come on it's the
[19:09] word that was eaten away the word is
[19:12] what failed the word is what went down
[19:14] not to baptism with the Holy Ghost
[19:16] you've got to remember one thing I don't
[19:18] care what you think about Luther Wesley
[19:20] Pentecost you can listen to these great
[19:23] guys explain all of these philosophies
[19:25] but remember it's the Holy Ghost in
[19:28] every age now listen now you tell me
[19:32] it's not then I'm going to say one thing
[19:34] to you you said well oh the Holy Ghost
[19:36] wouldn't the new birth wouldn't then
[19:39] that age is lost I'm pausing
[19:47] intentionally for you to think about
[19:49] that if it wasn't the Holy Ghost in each
[19:52] age and you lay me down one age you said
[19:55] well Luther Age wouldn't hold ago like
[19:57] the nine Age is lost they would have to
[20:00] go to the white throne to get anything
[20:03] do you see where you're at you see what
[20:06] people yeah but it sounds so good oh but
[20:08] I've got this quote here was it that
[20:10] Luther was in yeah and I had a brother
[20:12] one time and he was real bad to say say
[20:17] what the Prophet said I said okay you
[20:19] say this and I'll say the rest of what
[20:20] you're saying he saw it I said I gave
[20:24] him a quote where brother Owen said
[20:25] Luther died and went to hell or
[20:27] something like that there's a quote to
[20:28] though the wordings of it you know and I
[20:31] said now you say that Luke the
[20:35] denominator England you say that he
[20:38] wouldn't say it
[20:41] because he knew he's trapping his own
[20:43] self if he said Luther do nominee Luthor
[20:45] never denominated the Lutheran Church
[20:48] Wesley never denominated the Wesleyan
[20:51] Church right
[20:55] they denominated after them see so you
[21:00] can take quotes and make anything as I
[21:02] was saying the other day that you want
[21:03] to try to make out a would take it and
[21:05] line it up before and after and it'll
[21:08] all line up see then you got a teach
[21:12] than the new birth in three stages now
[21:16] not just in some case the baptismal over
[21:19] that reason that's coming to the new
[21:20] mark the new birth is in three stages
[21:22] the born-again experience is in three
[21:25] stages the statute of perfect man is in
[21:28] three stages the Holy Ghost is in three
[21:31] stages if you don't if you don't follow
[21:36] it like that yeah but what is that we'll
[21:38] just go to prove on the future home and
[21:41] just read the message of the future home
[21:43] or listen to it and you hear him
[21:46] explaining what I'm talking about
[21:50] because II you can't explain it without
[21:52] it but now listen see then revelation is
[21:57] what is to bring restoration right now
[22:04] as I said Luther's age they had the
[22:07] baptism of the Holy Ghost for that age
[22:08] Wesley's age had it for that age they
[22:11] had the new birth for that age they had
[22:14] the morning experience for that age but
[22:18] yet they will be called Reformation now
[22:22] there's a reason for that that's very
[22:24] wonderful to open to our eyes to see
[22:27] what God is trying through the Prophet
[22:30] to get us to understand we can follow
[22:35] right through the messaging and be in
[22:37] good shape
[22:38] all right now revelation will bring us
[22:45] to a place that we can talk about
[22:48] restoration all right now listen to the
[22:51] point that's trying to get across the
[22:53] life's message
[22:54] what is the new birth the revelation of
[22:57] Jesus Christ personally to you right so
[23:01] then the new birth is a revelation of
[23:03] Jesus Christ that will bring you the new
[23:07] birth that ever born-again believer down
[23:09] through ever age had that new birth all
[23:15] right see but they they could move up
[23:19] and down a little they could be you know
[23:21] gang ground there was people that had
[23:23] understanding of things and all but yet
[23:26] the statue of a perfect man was not
[23:29] completely restored back through there
[23:31] it has to wait until this life stage all
[23:34] right now there's where the restoration
[23:36] we'll get to it in a minute all right
[23:38] but think about it now I made an
[23:43] outstanding statement for you to keep in
[23:45] line because now watch the point of what
[23:47] I was bringing revelation puts us in
[23:53] stage for Reformation I mean for
[23:54] restoration now we're going to read one
[23:57] in a minute we're brother Branham was
[23:58] talking about Luther any talking about
[24:00] him and being a reformer he said but
[24:04] that reform was the foundation he said
[24:12] that was the foundation all right so
[24:15] keep it might not listen to what we're
[24:17] trying to say trying to bring you to a
[24:19] point of thinking about something you
[24:21] say rest restoration woo it's all things
[24:25] to be restored shields and now listen no
[24:28] it was never here I didn't write the
[24:34] book the Prophet said the headstone did
[24:36] not come I got it in here I'll get to it
[24:42] in a minute
[24:42] the headstone he said to never come yet
[24:46] huh sees in the headstones not
[24:48] restoration he said well I don't
[24:53] understand how in the world you can
[24:54] think about the seals in the fire this
[24:58] goes all the way to the little message
[25:01] called seeds not air with a shot
[25:04] and goes all the way into the point that
[25:06] we're brother branham will say Mary was
[25:10] a carrier of the seed but not the seed
[25:17] okay so we're not lost we're going a
[25:20] long ways but I'm cutting out messages
[25:22] to try to help to get up there instead
[25:24] of trying to you know and maybe I
[25:28] shouldn't do it maybe I should fly
[25:29] straight on and do but I try to help you
[25:31] I try to plant well surely now by now
[25:33] people understand that the new birth is
[25:36] a revelation of Jesus Christ I mean what
[25:39] else you gonna call it surely you're to
[25:42] that stage to think about it that it's
[25:45] not speaking in tongues out in Christ
[25:47] those are the after-effects the new
[25:52] birth is a revelation of Jesus Christ
[25:53] to you revealing God to you in the age
[25:57] you're living in and this is the age of
[25:59] the complete revelation of Jesus Christ
[26:02] right see if we have time we'll get to
[26:08] it work to think about it you take your
[26:10] life I mean you take your thoughts and
[26:12] you see the things of what has been
[26:17] restored because come on the one God was
[26:21] eaten away the water baptism the serpent
[26:24] seed the thing all of that was eaten
[26:27] away
[26:30] it's got to be restored well see think
[26:36] about where you've traveled to surely by
[26:39] now you understand serpent seed surely
[26:42] by now you understand what God surely
[26:44] about now we understand predestination
[26:51] we heart - what are we so blinded until
[26:59] we can't follow the point I'm trying to
[27:03] bring it to a point to show you what we
[27:05] need is this in this bracket we'll call
[27:09] it right here
[27:10] of the stature of a perfect man and why
[27:14] it had to be taught
[27:18] not doing away with watch before and
[27:20] after no way brother branham I've told
[27:25] you over and over go back to her go back
[27:28] to the to the inner veil where he's
[27:30] talking about a living moving
[27:32] instrumentality of Christianity and go
[27:34] to the statue of a perfect man and see
[27:36] if there's not a statement almost
[27:37] identical to the wording that he brought
[27:40] in 1956 and he was looking at it he said
[27:45] on that day that he preached the statue
[27:47] of a perfect man he said I just got
[27:49] these things up in the woods or the
[27:52] faith works or knowledge temperance
[27:53] patient he said oh what I was trying to
[27:56] bring a message on his whole message was
[28:00] coming down from the 40s 50s the coming
[28:06] to try to get us to the Statue of a
[28:08] perfect man or get back to the faith of
[28:11] the fathers do you remember what we we
[28:18] read there one day where Bertrand said
[28:19] if you don't know what the Holy Ghost is
[28:20] he said how do you know whether you got
[28:22] it or not then he turns around and says
[28:26] the Holy Ghost is so missed out by
[28:28] mankind incorrectly Akali sin less
[28:32] famous names what were you doing that
[28:39] day I know all about the baptism yeah
[28:40] yeah that's that's the way things goes
[28:44] but listen now to try to back up just a
[28:50] little bit and cover what we're talking
[28:54] about now we're not going to be talking
[28:57] about the headstone because it never
[29:02] come yet that's what's your profits it
[29:05] is to come in the last day
[29:07] the seals was to come in the last days
[29:10] and not in the early ministry so that's
[29:13] not restoration that's the seed are you
[29:20] with me come on now if you'll go back to
[29:23] the seeds not air with a joker
[29:25] masterpiece you'll hear what I said
[29:27] while ago that Mary was a Carrie
[29:30] the word yeah I need to preach that
[29:36] message Mary carrier the word yeah
[29:39] because the word was in Mary right she
[29:45] gave birth to the word but she was not
[29:48] the word the word is Christ himself
[29:50] right all right so she was a carrier of
[29:54] Christ she gave birth to cry but she was
[29:57] not she was the word of that age yet she
[29:59] was the word to represent the same thing
[30:01] of Azusa Street to represent the book of
[30:05] Acts right she had her place
[30:09] study what I'm asking you to study you
[30:13] come to me like that well what I need
[30:14] well then when I do it do you do you go
[30:16] back and do it do you get the message
[30:18] and listen all right all the way back
[30:26] into the message now for just a second
[30:29] of what we've been trying to bring a
[30:31] very important thing happened on the day
[30:35] of Pentecost then come about back are
[30:38] now the day of Pentecost what took place
[30:43] was a wonderful thing because it
[30:46] explains and I know you get tired of me
[30:50] quoting over and over something but it
[30:53] explains things if we'll listen you just
[30:59] say the day of Pentecost I told you
[31:03] talking with some brothers about it and
[31:04] they said we just don't see how we got
[31:06] the Holy Ghost like they did on that
[31:07] pinnacle I said well I didn't say it
[31:09] brother Branham did it well I don't see
[31:15] how he could say well I said you gonna
[31:17] talk to him about it because I'm just
[31:21] saying he said it but you see I tried to
[31:27] explain what I'm going to explain that
[31:29] I've explained to you a hundred times
[31:31] and I tried to explain it no I said well
[31:36] you explain it you know you explain it
[31:41] one of you says you ain't got nothing
[31:43] the other says you got everytime I said
[31:46] I'm gonna stay in the middle but I don't
[31:50] believe I got everything but I know I
[31:51] got something yeah we've listed in life
[31:57] not worth a lady you know suitable or I
[32:01] was really just warning them said I'm
[32:04] not what he want to be not what I ought
[32:05] to be not what he used to be though at
[32:08] least I come from somewhere all right
[32:10] all right now think about it on the day
[32:16] of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost fail it
[32:21] fell on first 120 in the upper room
[32:26] right now that Holy Ghost gave them a
[32:31] new birth place them into the body of
[32:35] Christ positionally placed them because
[32:38] of the word they had heard are you with
[32:44] me now we're going to read in a minute
[32:46] code on one will read it from brother
[32:47] Branham - were right around this one it
[32:49] says he said those disciples had those
[32:51] virtues they had these qualifications
[32:55] all right but now he didn't save the
[32:58] 3,000 outside see that's what I was
[33:03] trying to explain to those brothers why
[33:05] can't you see where brother Branham said
[33:07] I met people with the Holy Ghost exactly
[33:09] like the day of Pentecost nah I wouldn't
[33:14] want you to look at me and say brother
[33:17] Dale are you are you that guy to wear
[33:20] this I know I may not be there but at
[33:24] least give me the Holy Ghost let me be
[33:26] born again you know give me something to
[33:32] see that that group in the upper room
[33:37] they had been tutored and trained by the
[33:39] Lord Jesus for three and a half year
[33:49] then when the Holy Ghost fell look what
[33:53] it did if brother Branham was right and
[33:55] we read it and then he said he said they
[33:57] had these virtues okay that's in the
[34:02] same message it's in the statute of
[34:03] perfect Lent the hitch don't let him
[34:05] come in just keep listening you'll find
[34:09] it isn't that so they had these virtues
[34:15] why because they had heard the word for
[34:18] three and a half years and it
[34:20] persistently placed them to a place when
[34:23] the Holy Ghost fell they could be the
[34:27] teachers of the Word of God that's why
[34:30] Peter could would say you know add to
[34:34] your faith virtue or not esteem for
[34:36] faith one because he had experienced
[34:38] that Paul could cover it of adoption
[34:44] because he had experienced those
[34:47] positions in his life both of them
[34:52] saying then the same thing because they
[34:59] God doesn't use a novice to write his
[35:03] word he uses someone who is trained in
[35:08] the word an elder or whatever you want
[35:11] to call it to bring his word see because
[35:17] you don't this gladness get a guy off
[35:20] the barstool and bring him in on Sunday
[35:23] morning or Saturday night and Sunday
[35:24] mornings preaching no oh we're so fiery
[35:31] then you say you ain't gonna preach
[35:34] brother Dale he's doing the best he can
[35:37] do don't you think he's got a right to
[35:41] preach no Cody don't know what he's
[35:45] talking about
[35:47] yeah he can get up and say my candle got
[35:50] lit last night on the barstool but what
[35:55] else can he say
[35:59] he can't prove he ain't gonna drink no
[36:01] more you can't prove you ain't gonna be
[36:05] a drunkard or anything like that
[36:07] cuz he had no time you get what I'm
[36:09] saying be sensible about your thinking
[36:11] if your health revolution go to me
[36:14] revelation is the most simple thing that
[36:16] there is it is the simplicity of it that
[36:21] God can reveal something to you in
[36:24] simplicity but we cross it all up well
[36:28] don't you think don't you think he's
[36:30] been around long enough no let him sit
[36:32] down listen you guys wait what I told
[36:35] him when wait--come told me he was this
[36:40] is called operations that's good run run
[36:42] run run son until you run yourself down
[36:48] is that what brother branham said you
[36:51] need that I can find it for you he said
[36:56] I told him I said run until God runs you
[36:58] down because the Prophet said if you
[37:01] volunteer for something he said you're
[37:03] not worth it but he said when God has to
[37:05] break beat you down and bring you to a
[37:08] place then he can use you because you're
[37:12] not a novice with the best way thing
[37:17] that I could tell him of anything to do
[37:18] maybe not in this words to tell him but
[37:20] he knew it study the word study the word
[37:24] and be prepared get prepared then he
[37:28] come to me and they say daddy how come
[37:30] so what's on so-and-so I said because
[37:32] that's what you study the word when you
[37:34] was 12 years old it's coming back to you
[37:36] now do you understand what I'm getting
[37:40] at that group in the upper room it gave
[37:48] them the virtues when the Holy Ghost
[37:50] came because they had been tutored in
[37:53] the word and it placed them positionally
[37:56] and I used it deliberately to where it
[37:59] says Holy Spirit under there because
[38:01] that's the Holy Spirit that seals all of
[38:03] this and then the love is the headstone
[38:05] but it hasn't come yet
[38:08] we'll read that in a minute from the
[38:10] profit all right I've told you what I
[38:15] believe the hitch telling is I always
[38:18] told it
[38:18] I believe the headstone is the open of
[38:21] those seven sealed
[38:22] so the headstone didn't have to be
[38:24] restored because the seal didn't have to
[38:26] be restored
[38:29] they were never preached by nobody the
[38:33] Lord Jesus preached them in in what
[38:37] Matthew 6:24 excuse me but nobody knew
[38:43] what he was talking about so don't deal
[38:45] with restoration this to stay with what
[38:47] we're at and then you'll be able to
[38:50] understand reform so you'll be able to
[38:55] understand why Luther Wesley's called
[38:57] reform or Reformation if you'll get the
[39:01] Holy Ghost right and get it correct to
[39:04] what was eaten away when I say go to the
[39:11] restoration to the bride tree and look
[39:13] at it
[39:15] listen to what he says it eat it away
[39:17] but listen what he says we'll return now
[39:22] listen
[39:23] so that group that were with him and
[39:27] tutored for all of those years the Holy
[39:30] Ghost gave them Burke and placed them
[39:34] that's why I encourage you to study the
[39:39] Word of God whether you have the Holy
[39:42] Ghost or not whether you have the Holy
[39:49] Ghost or not study the word get prepared
[39:52] but if at least put to you know put it
[39:55] in the field at least get to exceed in
[39:58] the ground then the Holy Ghost can
[40:00] quicken it
[40:02] I've told you reading six books a day
[40:05] and listen to two tapes and General
[40:07] Motors riding bikers and forth and all
[40:09] that during the time when I said I did
[40:11] not have the baptism when all together
[40:14] but yet I knew that that word is if I
[40:17] could get it planted then when the Holy
[40:19] Ghost did come it could quicken greater
[40:25] than just oh I'm born again oh I'm in
[40:27] the messy
[40:27] I believe the profit all right so you
[40:35] see what I'm talking about
[40:36] the Holy Ghost positionally placed those
[40:41] early apostles and I use it that away
[40:45] because somebody out there they're all
[40:47] smart addicts listening to you well I
[40:49] think he was only the twelve was with
[40:51] the only one see that's that old Church
[40:53] of Christ you know we got 11 or 12 we
[40:55] got this or that or the other I thought
[40:57] you got that in man's mind is he gonna
[40:59] have it anyway I don't say all that I've
[41:02] told you before I don't say the whole
[41:04] 120 s in the Upper Room went up to the
[41:06] faith of the fathers because if they
[41:11] didn't how the word planted in the field
[41:12] they only went as far as they could go
[41:15] some of those people could have been
[41:17] anywhere up and down through here
[41:18] whatsoever as God quickens a word to but
[41:22] the Apostles went right here where it
[41:26] says Holy Spirit then they would be used
[41:31] to teach the word to teach others how to
[41:34] come to where they were what's the
[41:36] purpose of a teachers are our preachings
[41:39] are our instructors or what is to try to
[41:44] come to one of the position one today
[41:45] you know go brother Tom for boys he told
[41:49] me one day he said you don't learn too
[41:51] well I feel and I'd like to he said then
[41:54] you just meet me over there he set me
[41:59] down and he said this is what you do
[42:04] know there's old stick welder so a lot
[42:08] of you know that hard to do it's hard to
[42:09] get that thing to our talents you can't
[42:12] just go down there you got to get it to
[42:14] arc
[42:15] and that takes a long time now there's
[42:17] nigs and Tigs and Miggs and all of these
[42:20] other things you didn't turn it on with
[42:23] that old stick welders hard to do so he
[42:26] said sit down right tire and he kept on
[42:28] practice and he said you're doing pretty
[42:29] good because he taught me some tricks
[42:33] you can't get it to arc you just turn it
[42:35] higher it's gonna hark it might not be
[42:39] what you want but it's gonna arc so he
[42:43] kept turning me up until they got into
[42:44] arc then he kept turning me back and
[42:46] where I could an arc it all right and
[42:49] then he said wailed I said what he said
[42:53] from that end to this the end of that
[42:55] piece of metal bit rep me a bead hey
[43:00] pretty good what now he said one right
[43:04] side of it what net one right side of
[43:07] that one the point why he was teaching
[43:10] me how to weld see what a lot of people
[43:14] think oh yeah I got that lets go well
[43:17] something I wound up with a stick welder
[43:21] - well fenders on a Volkswagen now you
[43:26] know how thick the metal is on the Volks
[43:28] owner on any car I could weld it
[43:32] probably could right now if I played a
[43:33] little could wail that fender together a
[43:36] Volkswagen why because he taught me how
[43:38] to weld me not pretty but I can do it
[43:45] see that's what those apostles were they
[43:49] were tutored of the Lord he trained him
[43:52] he tutored him he told him remember they
[43:56] were together 24 hours a day seven days
[43:58] of the week I mean there's no vacations
[44:00] in all of this if it was he said come
[44:02] aside and let's rest he was with him all
[44:06] right are you with me then when the Holy
[44:09] Ghost fell on those that had been
[44:11] tutored it positionally placed them and
[44:14] then God could use them to write the
[44:17] word he could use them to write the word
[44:27] because they were capable that's in the
[44:29] statue of a perfect man if you've read
[44:32] it we see in the 3000 outside heard one
[44:39] sermon they don't matter to me though
[44:42] they got the Holy Ghost the Prophet said
[44:45] if you don't know what it is how do you
[44:47] know whether you got it or not
[44:50] now unquote is that what he said you
[44:54] want me to find that one for you you
[44:57] read it enough but listen see then what
[45:02] happened to the group outside hours
[45:06] later they heard one sermon and were
[45:12] quick in their heart
[45:15] what a wonderful sermon everyone these
[45:18] days I'll get around to preaching what I
[45:20] want to but it's hard to do you go back
[45:23] you you go in that book of Acts in acts
[45:25] 1 and you read that situation and you
[45:28] listen to that sermon that Peter brought
[45:32] all the way from the fathers and the
[45:36] wilderness all the way to bring it down
[45:40] to this man it was Jesus Christ
[45:44] oh what a message what a time no wonder
[45:50] they were pricked in their heart and
[45:53] they said me and brother what might we
[45:54] do to be safe said repent everyone every
[45:56] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[45:57] for the remission of sins and you shall
[45:59] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[46:04] they got born again they got the new
[46:08] birth they got the faith at the bottom
[46:11] of the pyramid if you've been over the
[46:13] the message of the statute of a perfect
[46:15] man you've heard him say that that is
[46:19] how faith and be born again how faith in
[46:26] people we again read the Word of God
[46:31] they don't need to read the Word of God
[46:33] to get saved boy you're really a good
[46:35] child why don't you want to know about
[46:38] your Savior let me put it this away
[46:41] you got that attitude you ain't gonna
[46:43] never get saved that's as plain as I can
[46:46] make it you want to argue with me you
[46:48] got that attitude of nonchalant and not
[46:51] caring you never will be saved in a way
[46:53] why don't you going back to the world
[46:54] and forget it
[46:55] brother to hell at all well why not what
[47:00] good is it
[47:03] he'd heap a turn around and get you
[47:05] killed I'm talking about spiritually but
[47:10] listen search see then when it did when
[47:14] the Holy Ghost came on that 3000 they
[47:18] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[47:20] but were not positionally placed with
[47:23] the Apostles they were only placed at
[47:26] what they could receive the new birth
[47:29] and then Peter is writing to them in 2nd
[47:35] Peter to try to tell them how to come to
[47:38] where he was Paul comes in with the
[47:41] adoption 'el parts of the Romans and the
[47:44] Galatians and the thing to try to side
[47:47] along with Peter to help the people to
[47:49] realize what they needed go back and
[47:56] learn reading the statute for a man
[47:58] we're brother branham's constantly
[47:59] talking about the divine nature of God
[48:02] the divine nature God's divine nature
[48:10] there's God's divine nature is the whole
[48:17] revealed Word of God ok let's get
[48:22] started then okay go ahead ever who
[48:27] brother Anderson pull up number one
[48:28] listen let's read a little bit let's see
[48:33] what those disciples had and remember
[48:39] what they had is what they're teaching
[48:41] that we've got to hire there's no such
[48:46] thing as saying well maybe I'll get that
[48:48] I don't know if I get time I'll try it's
[48:51] in the statue of a perfect man
[48:55] you got to have these virtues so look
[49:02] paragraph 14 I can imagine them apostles
[49:06] never acted like us they went around
[49:09] probably being a few words now that fits
[49:12] us all pretty good place Tony right
[49:19] we've got a bunch of blabbermouth they
[49:22] had a man a few words I said us that
[49:28] puts me in there with it and the rest of
[49:29] you okay any problem they went around
[49:35] problem in a few words till they got in
[49:38] the pulpit they walked in and they done
[49:40] what they were supposed to do and walked
[49:43] out now remember these are not to
[49:47] novices these are the Apostles they
[49:52] walked in they done what they were
[49:53] supposed to do and walked out yes sir
[49:55] they had power they had virtue they had
[49:58] no arguments with men they knowed where
[50:01] they stood that's all they knowed who
[50:04] they believed they kept on walking in
[50:08] the spirit doing only just as I said the
[50:12] other night one little nod that's all
[50:15] God had to do nothing's there nothing
[50:20] going to stop them a little nod in other
[50:25] words a little leadership God speaking
[50:27] to him too
[50:28] they didn't question and study will
[50:31] order that's you see we make those jokes
[50:33] we think we're so wonderful you know we
[50:35] talk about the guy hanging up and the
[50:36] Lord says turn loose and trust me and we
[50:38] say let me get a second opinion we think
[50:41] I'll let it so wonderful one of these
[50:44] days we're gonna find out you blaspheme
[50:45] and the Holy Ghost
[50:47] making jokes about God okay we think
[50:55] it's beautiful
[50:56] I didn't get a note I got knocked down
[51:00] we'll get up and tell me what the Lord
[51:02] told you
[51:05] no problem I trust what's within me come
[51:10] on tell me about that's why I'm on the
[51:12] Internet
[51:13] it's open to the world faint right come
[51:18] and show me number one I could be helped
[51:21] number two if I'm right then I ain't
[51:23] worried about it I'm not concerned about
[51:27] it
[51:28] one little nod that's all God had to do
[51:31] then nothing gonna stop them they didn't
[51:34] question and study in whom Hall and
[51:37] worry like we do whether they should do
[51:40] this or not remember brother Branham
[51:43] preach the message called why cry speak
[51:44] okay you know all the soul story they
[51:48] went ahead and done it anyhow just one
[51:50] little nod from God that done it just as
[51:53] soon why how could they know it was a
[51:56] nod from God they had all these virtues
[52:00] in here all these qualifications okay
[52:11] somebody had it know the first little
[52:16] nod of God compared with every bit of
[52:18] this and with this word they knowed it
[52:22] was the Word of God and the way they
[52:25] went didn't have to worry about nothing
[52:27] else when God spoke they went we speak I
[52:33] was thinking the other night about when
[52:35] the brother was preaching one of them
[52:39] they were gonna get in a statue of
[52:41] perfect man and we're gonna find out
[52:42] even if you have these virtues and
[52:44] things are still a human being you
[52:50] remember when Paul come along they were
[52:53] scared to death of him they wouldn't any
[52:58] of them wanted to saddle with him right
[53:01] until God spoke to one of them the rest
[53:07] of was still scared to death had the
[53:10] virtues come on that's where we want to
[53:17] do this see
[53:18] you you got any temper no bless God and
[53:23] I got born again I got rid of my temper
[53:26] well why is your face red now according
[53:30] to the Prophet according to the Bible
[53:33] you can be born again and still have
[53:36] problems with a little temperament now
[53:39] not that uncontrollable cussing temper
[53:42] now that's supposed to be gone before
[53:44] the bird gets tired that's supposed to
[53:46] go with sanctification we'll get to that
[53:49] we talking about John we're talking
[53:51] about normal things of life come on
[53:56] you've got almost patience but I don't
[54:00] have and the only time it I've ever said
[54:04] anything God spoke to me that's what he
[54:07] spoke to me about he said if you'll have
[54:12] patience with the people that approve
[54:13] you've got patience
[54:14] well I haven't had patience with the
[54:17] people so I ain't going arguing about
[54:20] when I get patience I'll tell you I got
[54:23] it oh yeah it works sometimes but it
[54:28] don't work all the time okay even though
[54:33] you're born again but we folks get rid
[54:35] of them come on but listen church is
[54:44] better brendham said how could they know
[54:48] that it was a nod from God he said they
[54:54] had these virtues they had these
[54:57] qualifications all right I brought it to
[55:00] make sure that you wouldn't argue the
[55:02] point it is in the statue of a perfect
[55:04] man at the life of the message he speaks
[55:06] of the headstone that is to come go back
[55:09] and listen or read it let's see Holy
[55:13] Spirit coming down they had the virtues
[55:19] we'll get to it eventually faith is not
[55:25] a virtue
[55:26] so you don't have to worry it is a gift
[55:31] it is God okay but now listen boy to
[55:36] number two quitsies questions and
[55:37] answers 1964 they remember statue
[55:41] program 62 and what does he say about it
[55:44] and just a little like pyrimidine it
[55:46] would we find in that pyramid
[55:47] they never did get the headstone on it
[55:49] why the headstones yet to come okay like
[55:55] I said you go to the statue of perfect
[55:56] man you get right over to the live part
[55:58] of it then you're even talking about the
[55:59] headstone Christ coming God coming down
[56:09] through Christ Holy Spirit welding all
[56:11] these things together to make a pyramids
[56:14] or something to be captain that's that's
[56:15] pretty close what the headstones yet to
[56:18] come look what he said the seven steps
[56:20] in the pyramid so he's talked about the
[56:23] pyramid sixty-four the headstone hadn't
[56:26] come yet he said all right that should
[56:29] settle that enough for no problems I
[56:31] don't care what brother so and so says
[56:33] the headstone is here that's his
[56:36] business I believe it is here by now but
[56:39] when he was to saying that it was from
[56:42] tyre
[56:43] he's the one who said it not me and you
[56:50] listen what about these wonderful
[56:53] virtues go ahead and number three let's
[56:56] pick up a thought while we're on this
[56:57] what about these wonderful virtues now
[57:01] brother branham in the statute of
[57:03] perfect man is also blaspheme is nine
[57:04] he's one of the two for sure he said a
[57:07] lot of people have a portion of these
[57:09] virtues and not even born again you've
[57:14] met people that are really nice and good
[57:16] and honest people and sincere and
[57:19] wonderful friends and time he said they
[57:21] have these were a lot of these virtues
[57:23] you know the the old condo priests had a
[57:26] lot of the virtues he wasn't a mean old
[57:33] devil it was a condo priest that was
[57:37] where the deception comes in
[57:40] well he could have had a lot of them
[57:43] virtuous there doesn't mean a thing
[57:46] brother Branham talks about that Moses
[57:50] had patience well Moses never had born
[57:54] again Holy Ghost feel patience for the
[57:56] stature of a perfect man because it
[57:58] wasn't back there he had patient you can
[58:02] have a lot of these virtues and still
[58:03] not even be a Christian he said but now
[58:07] look what he brings it - on the way back
[58:10] 1962 if you try to act like you've got
[58:14] them before you have listened it's like
[58:17] I said the other day like a black bird
[58:18] trying to put peacock feathers in his
[58:20] wings then you see you see I'm a peacock
[58:24] he is a that's something he's stuck in
[58:26] himself it has to grow from the inside
[58:29] out that's what I like these virtues has
[58:34] to grow from the inside out
[58:36] why because faith puts him on the inside
[58:42] faith puts him on the inside the
[58:45] born-again experience puts him on the
[58:47] inside of you and listen it has to grow
[58:51] from the inside out and that's the way
[58:54] the Holy Ghost is it's not something you
[58:56] some your own or something like that
[58:58] it's a new birth you've got to be born
[59:01] again and these virtues of the Holy
[59:03] Ghost has to come from the inside out
[59:10] so if you didn't get the new birth how
[59:14] can you expect the virtues to come I'd
[59:20] like to give you these because I think
[59:21] brother Brennan was at a pretty good
[59:23] place cuz now listen he said it took him
[59:27] 33 years and he's talking about patience
[59:30] on the statute of perfect man he said 33
[59:33] years now what about preaching for all
[59:38] those years now I didn't write the book
[59:41] you know didn't say what'd he say it
[59:43] he's once said it he said I just got
[59:46] this the other day where this tied into
[59:48] a message ain't saying he had never read
[59:51] that Scripture and preached on that
[59:52] Tereza no it was where he got it to
[59:54] connect in and tie together on what he
[59:57] was preaching though I believe brother
[1:00:01] Branham had those virtues okay let's get
[1:00:03] that point better Brown had those
[1:00:05] virtues and they was on the inside of it
[1:00:08] because you don't want to believe that
[1:00:09] he had the virtues you could say this
[1:00:11] because they said well I got one thing
[1:00:12] to put it on they had to be somebody if
[1:00:16] you and I are ever gonna get these
[1:00:18] virtues there had to be somebody to come
[1:00:26] and teach us the truth so that solves
[1:00:30] the whole problem you're gonna argue
[1:00:33] about this part of that for they had to
[1:00:35] be somebody and what did he come for I
[1:00:40] thought that we believed Malachi for the
[1:00:47] worthy what he'll do
[1:00:48] turn arts of the children to the
[1:00:51] father's fathers his children back
[1:00:54] interval I thought that's what he come
[1:00:59] for I thought he says in the statute of
[1:01:02] perfect man he said Lord fill me up with
[1:01:04] this virtue knowledge to enforce
[1:01:05] patiently to wear that I can teach
[1:01:08] others did you listen to that in the
[1:01:12] message did you read that in the book
[1:01:15] when brother John wanted to bar my my
[1:01:19] statue of a perfect man book and what I
[1:01:21] handed it to him he looked that thing
[1:01:23] over because it's got a lot of writing
[1:01:27] in it and probably be by now he's way if
[1:01:31] he's read three pages he's found a lot
[1:01:33] of quotes from other books besides this
[1:01:36] diet because anything that but I I think
[1:01:40] thought about that I thought when he
[1:01:42] goes on and turned that burger that
[1:01:45] ain't stature a perfect man that's
[1:01:47] blasphemous names player Seung Jo that's
[1:01:50] where it goes back to okay go ahead
[1:01:52] let's go up number four see I believe he
[1:01:57] had to come this Peter
[1:01:59] now listen you'll see the point of what
[1:02:02] I'm driving at the reason they had to
[1:02:05] three
[1:02:06] five years compared to the few hours
[1:02:12] message and one message they had three
[1:02:14] and a half years of the Lord Jesus
[1:02:16] teaching them these things right let's
[1:02:24] see here comes a Paul never the other
[1:02:27] day was trying to explain here comes the
[1:02:29] Apostle Paul he said he got the Holy
[1:02:32] Ghost right his eyes are opened he goes
[1:02:34] but where did it go he said I just
[1:02:36] conferred with them just a little bit
[1:02:37] then I left one time he says I conferred
[1:02:40] with no one but you know what I'm
[1:02:42] talking about
[1:02:42] he runs he went down through sure he
[1:02:44] seems to know them said hi how you do it
[1:02:46] I'm glad you're a Christian I'm a
[1:02:47] Christian too he went on but then he
[1:02:49] went to his self to get the word because
[1:02:52] he was a prophet you'll see why it's
[1:02:57] called Reformation Luther couldn't do it
[1:02:59] he was not a prophet Wesley was not a
[1:03:04] prophet Zeus's tree not a prophet come
[1:03:15] on that's why it was wait until the last
[1:03:17] days of the Prophet to be sent to where
[1:03:19] we could get back to the faith of the
[1:03:20] fathers the faith of the fathers is the
[1:03:22] stature of a perfect man if you put them
[1:03:24] together by now you'll see that it's the
[1:03:27] adoption on Paul goes to itself and
[1:03:30] comes out preaching the same thing Peter
[1:03:32] is Peters preaching statute further then
[1:03:34] get born again and then growth
[1:03:36] development to come out to work that God
[1:03:38] can trust you Paul comes over in college
[1:03:40] and adoption
[1:03:41] he says you're born into a family by the
[1:03:43] birth he said then you take a tutor and
[1:03:46] the tutor tutor trains you until you
[1:03:48] come to the place to your name just as
[1:03:50] good as on a checkbook that's teaching
[1:03:52] the same thing the Paul didn't have to
[1:03:57] have Peter to tell him he was a prophet
[1:04:05] brother Branham didn't have nobody to be
[1:04:08] able to tell him because nobody didn't
[1:04:12] have it
[1:04:14] maybe versions of it or different things
[1:04:16] yes but they didn't that went out to
[1:04:19] teach to him so he goes to the backside
[1:04:22] of the desert and he gets the message
[1:04:25] and when he comes out he preaches the
[1:04:27] stature of a perfect man he preaches the
[1:04:31] faith of the father he preaches Malachi
[1:04:33] 4 he's talking to one brother and one
[1:04:39] brother said do you believe your
[1:04:41] melikhaya for he said yeah he said why
[1:04:42] don't you get on telling it he said
[1:04:44] because you can't do that he told it
[1:04:48] enough like it went but he couldn't just
[1:04:50] walk out there hey I'm Matt I'm Malachi
[1:04:52] forward well but he proved what he had
[1:04:58] that's what I like I like it this way
[1:05:01] brother Branham would say I am a Malachi
[1:05:05] or he wouldn't say I'm the prophet of
[1:05:07] this what he said now when this man
[1:05:09] comes you ever listened to it this way
[1:05:12] he said when this man comes of Malachi 4
[1:05:14] he'll do this and this and this and this
[1:05:17] he'll have the discernment he'll have
[1:05:20] the women he'll beat Nizhny he'll have
[1:05:22] his back turned to the congregation
[1:05:23] calling out people he'll have all kind
[1:05:25] of thing and then he's turning around
[1:05:27] right there doing it right in front
[1:05:32] right he was declaring who he was by the
[1:05:38] signs and the wonders he was telling you
[1:05:44] what the man would do and then he turns
[1:05:45] around and does it then he turns back
[1:05:49] that's what people don't like he said
[1:05:50] you come on you want to show me come on
[1:05:55] right should come show me where I'm
[1:05:58] wrong oh they knew better than that
[1:06:02] let's see he had these virtues he could
[1:06:07] receive the virtues or qualifications
[1:06:10] because he was a prophet to be taught
[1:06:12] the word but they had to come by the
[1:06:14] word right so listen what he says on the
[1:06:19] Statue of a perfect man he's talking
[1:06:21] about an incident happened where
[1:06:23] somebody would had really I guess they
[1:06:25] died because of what he said and dead
[1:06:27] who said Billy you come a little late I
[1:06:29] said never too late he's here I've had a
[1:06:33] battle and you're the other boys some
[1:06:36] more voyage centers was standing there
[1:06:38] are some of his relatives I said you see
[1:06:40] boys make ready cause you'll come to
[1:06:43] this place they said what I like about
[1:06:47] run around is one thing you call him to
[1:06:51] pray for somebody laying on the floor
[1:06:53] dead and he turns around and talks to
[1:06:55] the boys right
[1:07:01] you know what screaming hollering let me
[1:07:03] get that let me get that because he
[1:07:05] knows what to do it he said right here I
[1:07:09] said never too late he's here he turns
[1:07:14] around and talking to the boys and says
[1:07:16] boys get ready because you're gonna come
[1:07:19] to this you got to come right down here
[1:07:22] say maybe not with this this cancer you
[1:07:26] might come with something else out there
[1:07:28] on the highway bleeding to death or
[1:07:29] something you've got to come to it we
[1:07:32] talked to them I was waiting to see what
[1:07:36] the spirit said do waiting first thing
[1:07:40] you know now he done said he's here know
[1:07:46] what to say first thing you know I felt
[1:07:48] that little nod lay your hands on him I
[1:07:52] walked around said all you bow your
[1:07:55] heads they all bowed her head
[1:07:57] - it's really young fellas I doubt the
[1:07:59] end of it it tailed it he was raised up
[1:08:04] next morning he was setting up talking
[1:08:07] to him I wish he would tell you this
[1:08:13] messenger malachi forward this luke 1730
[1:08:15] man he's gonna do this this did he turn
[1:08:18] around and do it you know I don't
[1:08:24] understand why people I don't maybe
[1:08:26] forgive me for saying dumb and stupid
[1:08:29] but he ever thought about when brother
[1:08:32] branham's up there preaching and he says
[1:08:34] what's man's number six and he said
[1:08:37] that's said we've never had a man that
[1:08:40] his name
[1:08:40] ended in a a.m. until this day and said
[1:08:45] we've got a man now Billy Graham said
[1:08:48] that's GRA
[1:08:50] six letters but said now that that's not
[1:08:54] right said we need seven letters and
[1:08:58] we've got this man to the world that has
[1:09:01] the six letters to match that of Abraham
[1:09:03] you know I don't count myself to be
[1:09:14] smart but I'd probably look at the track
[1:09:18] that they give out and who is this guy
[1:09:23] William Marion Branham seven letters see
[1:09:32] snow and it ends at 8:00 a.m. so you
[1:09:37] know this guy must be the one that he's
[1:09:39] talking about the stage with Abraham
[1:09:41] because Abraham representing instance
[1:09:43] other part makes am said now here's this
[1:09:46] staying here like sister Barbara gets
[1:09:50] hurt a Lakota it really comes out to ATM
[1:09:52] because that's where you get the part of
[1:09:54] God's name and come on most of you know
[1:09:58] all of you should know the story letter
[1:09:59] randoms nine last name was not Brando it
[1:10:03] was bray hem his daddy changed it and
[1:10:06] made it brown him added the end that
[1:10:10] right he added one letter to it to make
[1:10:12] it come out eight Rock right he put the
[1:10:17] letter to it now listen he's talking
[1:10:24] about this little nod he's talking about
[1:10:29] that God gave him just a little nod he's
[1:10:34] talking about the coming to the Statue
[1:10:37] of a perfect man
[1:10:42] yeah it's coming to the Statue of a
[1:10:47] perfect man cuz you see now we'll back
[1:10:51] up on this cuz it won't stop right here
[1:10:52] on this point we'll back up on it
[1:10:55] alright so you with me what I'm talking
[1:10:58] about that the three thousand only heard
[1:11:01] one sermon but they got the new birth
[1:11:06] the Upper Room experience of the
[1:11:09] Apostles brought them to be the teachers
[1:11:12] of the others of how to get were they
[1:11:14] were act to bring the virtues the
[1:11:19] disciples had the virtuous like I told
[1:11:22] you Paul he went to his self he come out
[1:11:25] of our teaching the same doctrine that
[1:11:28] Peter talked I may not mean nothing to
[1:11:30] you but I've always wondered why would
[1:11:33] he say it like that because I'm honest
[1:11:35] I'm praying come on I know I'm dumb and
[1:11:38] stupid but I don't put it to the basis
[1:11:41] that Peter said cat
[1:11:43] Paul says cat they said the same thing
[1:11:46] when we get to say the same thing now
[1:11:51] we'll all be right so now everybody come
[1:11:53] on when you enter cat no one have you
[1:11:57] said it yet
[1:11:57] oh okay thank you hey he's with me
[1:12:00] now the rest of y'all get women we got
[1:12:03] it made we got a revelation we all said
[1:12:06] the same thing what does it mean Peter
[1:12:12] and Paul Brenner Brennan said they did
[1:12:16] not have any problem in doctrine he said
[1:12:20] they had a problem with Peter in the way
[1:12:22] that he behaved himself you know what
[1:12:27] there's not another record anywhere that
[1:12:30] Peter ever said one word about that
[1:12:32] except one time he did finalize it one
[1:12:36] day when he said it he said Paul says
[1:12:39] things that are hard to be understood
[1:12:43] that many wrassle wept for their own
[1:12:46] destruction he well remembered that
[1:12:51] going on but you know God didn't
[1:12:57] see they had the same doctrine uh-huh
[1:13:03] Paul priest one God Peter preached one
[1:13:05] god Paul brought serpent seed so you
[1:13:09] know Peter them could bring serpent seed
[1:13:10] it's just according to what they were
[1:13:12] needed you find the Apostle Paul after a
[1:13:16] while if you really keep reading you
[1:13:17] your your Bible you'll find that Paul is
[1:13:20] kind of up graded just to higher above
[1:13:23] and he's really coming to the place that
[1:13:27] Peter now this is personal way I look at
[1:13:30] it and read it Peter finally wound up
[1:13:34] listening to Paul yet Peter opened the
[1:13:39] door
[1:13:40] Peter done all the things what Paul
[1:13:42] wrote it down to explain it right but
[1:13:49] they talked the same time they talked
[1:13:55] because they had what they were teaching
[1:14:00] brother Brown said he wouldn't preach on
[1:14:02] hell until it was revealed right there's
[1:14:08] a lot of things it is marked I marked my
[1:14:12] old I wouldn't give a brother
[1:14:17] John my oh I found him at Daniel seventy
[1:14:22] weeks because my old book is worse or
[1:14:25] mark talking the others because there's
[1:14:26] a lot in that old book that you'd see if
[1:14:29] you want to read it it'll say question
[1:14:30] mark I don't know what he's talking
[1:14:34] about page three question mark
[1:14:41] poor five six ten twenty question but
[1:14:47] then when I'd read it and I'd see what
[1:14:48] he told me then I mark over that but I
[1:14:51] don't never write with a pencil or you
[1:14:53] can erase I put mine in plain bold you
[1:14:57] know ink and I I'll write that and then
[1:15:04] underline it well then I
[1:15:06] mark over that and say okay you know
[1:15:10] what I mean I understand what you
[1:15:11] talking about now I'm not going over and
[1:15:14] I still a question I don't understand
[1:15:15] what he's talking about but when it
[1:15:18] comes and I would not preach that
[1:15:20] message and brother mode I told him
[1:15:22] about he said he told the church he
[1:15:24] announced it he said brother Dale's
[1:15:26] gonna preach on the statue of on Daniel
[1:15:28] seventy weeks and I wouldn't preach it
[1:15:31] until I questioned him to his point I
[1:15:33] said you know that I might say things
[1:15:37] that are contrary to you on this message
[1:15:40] I'm not saying I did I just said I had
[1:15:43] it on his straight talk with him he said
[1:15:46] preach it he said then we'll handle the
[1:15:50] rest of it later because he was the
[1:15:52] pastor but I would not preach it until
[1:15:55] every one of those question marks was
[1:15:56] gone I've made this statement and
[1:16:02] ministers look at you like you're you
[1:16:05] know and I am I don't know what you want
[1:16:07] to call me and I ain't worried about but
[1:16:10] I spend more time trying to tear down my
[1:16:12] sermon than I do in trying to get it
[1:16:20] that's an odd statement in it I get a
[1:16:24] thought I get something from God to
[1:16:26] speak I'm part of this that I've got in
[1:16:29] here it's been two weeks waiting for him
[1:16:33] to give me an okay to move up another
[1:16:35] step I wrote it over yesterday and you
[1:16:38] all receive my notes I wrote over to one
[1:16:40] spot stock got up went in the room with
[1:16:42] nany and we talked and everything was
[1:16:46] going on and all at once in there where
[1:16:51] she was at walking through the house
[1:16:53] here he come just another thought to put
[1:16:59] with that to make it clear all right see
[1:17:05] because I ain't gonna preach it if I
[1:17:07] don't understand it
[1:17:12] and like I said I spend time trying to
[1:17:14] tear down the message before I preach it
[1:17:21] cuz if I can turn it down then there's a
[1:17:25] loophole if all the ministers would do
[1:17:32] that you'd have it a whole lot less
[1:17:33] trouble
[1:17:34] I'm just as honest to say that as I can
[1:17:36] say it if you don't agree with that they
[1:17:39] something wrong with you mentally
[1:17:40] because you ought to know they ought to
[1:17:42] try to study it out first to see whether
[1:17:44] it's right or not like one big brother
[1:17:47] one time I remember he said he said I
[1:17:49] don't worry about I get I just go
[1:17:50] preaches and God fell interested that
[1:17:53] was one he got caught he never doctorate
[1:17:55] there was that come down through that
[1:17:57] and I'm not joking
[1:18:01] but listen church get the last word and
[1:18:04] it won't quit those apostles when they
[1:18:13] came out of that upper room they had
[1:18:16] that same Holy Spirit that the Lord
[1:18:20] Jesus had and he told him he says now
[1:18:25] after I'm gone he said that comforter
[1:18:29] will come to you and said he'll teach
[1:18:31] you things I said not only that said you
[1:18:34] teach you things to come you know
[1:18:36] whatsoever I've said he said he'll teach
[1:18:37] you things to come but the runs that he
[1:18:39] took him further into the revelation and
[1:18:44] they were able then to go out and write
[1:18:47] the word the three thousand down stars
[1:18:51] could take what they said and start
[1:18:53] moving in that RIM as babies because
[1:18:58] that's what the Bible says newborn babes
[1:19:01] desire the sincere milk of the word the
[1:19:04] apostles in the upper room
[1:19:06] come on the Upper Room experience
[1:19:08] wouldn't you warn babies they were the
[1:19:12] one telling that we need the newborn
[1:19:14] baby stuff they told us the weight of
[1:19:20] God
[1:19:28] that's all that the minister's supposed
[1:19:30] to do is to teach you the way to God
[1:19:34] that they've been brought in their own
[1:19:36] life what about it but Stan come on
[1:19:43] brother I go any further I got to go
[1:19:45] into the point but of the next out but
[1:19:54] ending it up while you're thinking
[1:19:58] Luther then was called Reformation it
[1:20:02] was a reformer a reformer I'll give you
[1:20:07] the quotes brother Branham said a
[1:20:10] reformer came for tried to reform the
[1:20:13] former age listen and brought his
[1:20:18] message and said but his message never
[1:20:21] carried on to the original day of
[1:20:24] Pentecost of the signs and wonders he
[1:20:27] said that's where the trouble went he
[1:20:28] said he's reforming and he said then it
[1:20:31] goes down then the next would be Wesley
[1:20:35] coming up and looking at Luther and
[1:20:36] trying to reform the Lutheran Church and
[1:20:41] he starts heading toward the truth and
[1:20:47] goes with it after a while he goes into
[1:20:49] the ground he's a reformer even the
[1:20:53] suits the street you got a key in Azusa
[1:20:56] Street that's real close brother Brandon
[1:20:59] will call Azusa Street the baptism when
[1:21:01] the whole to go Reformation but then I'm
[1:21:09] gonna say something because there's a
[1:21:11] statement I made about a week ago were
[1:21:15] you baptized into the body for the gifts
[1:21:19] brother Branham said if you're not in
[1:21:22] the body you can't have the gifts of God
[1:21:27] yet gifts forever were sinners
[1:21:33] give what's he talking about what gift
[1:21:38] is he referring to why would he call
[1:21:43] Azusa Street the restoration of the
[1:21:48] gifts the gifts was in the book of Acts
[1:21:59] and needed to be restored but that ain't
[1:22:03] all of it just what I said why would he
[1:22:07] call it Reformation when we called it
[1:22:13] restoration why would he say Azusa
[1:22:22] Street is the restoration of the gifts
[1:22:27] then put it in a statute of perfect man
[1:22:30] or blasphemy as night he said that the
[1:22:33] gifts without these virtues is a stumble
[1:22:36] it's not stumbling its stumble as to you
[1:22:39] mble stumble block they don't put
[1:22:42] stumbling you'll never find it trying to
[1:22:44] hunt it stumble its to you mble stumble
[1:22:48] block to the unbeliever real genuine
[1:22:55] gifts could he be talking about these
[1:23:02] gifts
[1:23:09] because you to be in the body I mean you
[1:23:12] can have speaking in tongues without
[1:23:14] being in the body but what about a gift
[1:23:18] in the body of Christ
[1:23:19] oh well we got best thing anybody having
[1:23:25] a distinct time it's lighter than you
[1:23:32] think
