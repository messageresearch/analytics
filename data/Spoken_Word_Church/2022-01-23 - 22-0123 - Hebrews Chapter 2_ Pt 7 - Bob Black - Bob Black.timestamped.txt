[0:00] jesus could be back in the house of the
[0:01] lord
[0:03] we'll keep going through the book of
[0:04] hebrews
[0:06] we just had such a wonderful time
[0:08] yesterday and just come expecting for
[0:10] more more
[0:12] from god this morning
[0:16] so just to recap a little bit like where
[0:18] we left off last time we uh we we
[0:20] stopped at verse 16 and chapter two
[0:23] around about that and paul was saying
[0:26] for verily he took not on him the nature
[0:28] of angels but he took on him the seed of
[0:30] abraham
[0:32] and we know that
[0:33] that god gave all of those promises that
[0:36] in genesis to this to the seed to thy
[0:38] seed and and speaking of of
[0:40] the inheritance of the land and all the
[0:42] spiritual promises that he gave to him
[0:44] and
[0:45] and and paul would say in galatians 3 16
[0:48] not to
[0:50] not he saith not into seeds as of many
[0:52] but as of one and to thy seed which is
[0:54] christ and so we know
[0:56] we know that the promise of that that
[0:58] promise of the seed of abraham is
[1:01] is wrapped up in in everything that
[1:03] jesus christ accomplished
[1:05] but you know there there's a law in the
[1:07] bible that when you when you plant a
[1:08] seed it's going to every seed bringeth
[1:10] forth of its own kind and and maybe if
[1:12] you meditate on that why why does every
[1:14] seed bring forth of its own kind if you
[1:16] plant corn in the ground why does it
[1:17] come up corn if you plant apple or apple
[1:20] seed why is it was it going to come up
[1:22] with apple tree
[1:23] and the reason is because of the life
[1:25] down on the inside of that so with the
[1:28] life the life is really the thing that
[1:30] we're talking about
[1:32] so that uh
[1:34] you if you plant uh if you plant uh the
[1:36] word of god and it begins to spring up
[1:38] within you it's going to bring up bring
[1:40] forth the same life that was in jesus
[1:43] christ and that's how we have access we
[1:46] have access by the new birth by those
[1:48] promises that god gave to us through
[1:49] christ we have access to that same life
[1:52] that was in christ in other words the
[1:54] same life that the same one that called
[1:56] abraham and told him to turn aside and
[1:58] lead him and
[1:59] go through his journey that same one
[2:02] that was was talking to him and dealing
[2:04] with him as the same one that it lives
[2:06] in us now
[2:08] and if we go to the next slide
[2:11] in galatians 3 28
[2:13] and paul says there is neither you nor
[2:15] greek there is neither bond nor free
[2:18] there is neither male nor female for you
[2:20] are all one in christ jesus
[2:22] and if you be christ then are ye
[2:25] abraham's seed and heirs according to
[2:27] the promise
[2:29] so that means if you're in christ then
[2:31] you've got that same life in you and
[2:34] then you've got access to all the
[2:35] promises and that should be an
[2:37] encouragement to every believer that
[2:39] when you get in a rough spot you lay
[2:41] those promises before god and and say
[2:43] with faith the same kind of faith that
[2:46] the the the reason that you can believe
[2:48] like abraham is because you've got that
[2:49] life in you that life is in in you is is
[2:53] is really what does the believe in what
[2:54] paul said the life that i now live i
[2:56] live by the faith of the son of god
[2:59] you're living by his faith
[3:01] because you've got that same life then
[3:02] now you have the ability to believe
[3:04] you've got the ability to believe like
[3:06] abraham and to look to the unseen not to
[3:09] the things that you see
[3:10] but you're looking past the things that
[3:12] are visible to you and you're looking to
[3:14] the promises of god
[3:16] and that's a a promise that we can lay
[3:18] hold to in this hour and when we see see
[3:20] lots of calamities and lots of bad
[3:22] things uh that somebody was telling me
[3:24] the other day it looks like um we're on
[3:26] the brink of of something with rusher
[3:28] and all all sorts of things happening
[3:30] but yet we're not looking to the things
[3:32] that we can see with our visible eye but
[3:34] we're looking to the promises of god and
[3:36] we have a promise that there's going to
[3:38] be a rapture we have a promise for
[3:39] healing and all these things that are
[3:41] laying in god's word that you can lay
[3:43] claim to because we are the seed of
[3:45] abraham
[3:47] we can when we when we pray for one
[3:49] another and when we go praying for our
[3:51] family we can we can lay claim to those
[3:53] promises saying god we we are the seed
[3:55] of abraham
[3:58] now
[3:59] if the evidence of that if we go to the
[4:01] next slide the evidence of that seed of
[4:02] abraham is that if in matthew chapter 23
[4:05] 23 it says but he that received seed
[4:07] into the good ground is he that heareth
[4:09] the word so if you receive that seed
[4:11] into the good ground just like just like
[4:13] any seed you plant the seed and and then
[4:15] down in the inside that seed has got the
[4:17] life so the life has to break through
[4:20] free and like brother branham was just
[4:21] talking about in that sermon if there's
[4:23] got to be a dying out so that crust that
[4:25] that all the all your ideas and
[4:27] everything on the outside of that shell
[4:29] of the of the seed just dies out and
[4:31] then they can the life can come forth
[4:33] so if the life if you've received and
[4:35] then you've died out to your own ideas
[4:37] and and that life springs forth in you
[4:39] then then god begins to open up the word
[4:41] to you which is why it says he that
[4:43] receives seed into the good ground is he
[4:45] that heareth the word
[4:46] and understandeth it
[4:48] the word begins to open up to you how do
[4:50] you understand because that same life
[4:53] that was in the same life that wrote the
[4:55] bible is now in you to reveal the bible
[4:58] which also beareth forth fruit and
[5:00] bringeth forth someone hundredfold some
[5:02] 60 some 30.
[5:04] and in first john 3 9 it says whosoever
[5:07] is born of god does not commit sin
[5:09] for his seed remaineth in him and he
[5:11] cannot sin because he is born of god
[5:14] so if that seed is received if you've
[5:17] received that seed and the life springs
[5:18] up within your soul then in your soul
[5:20] you cannot doubt god's word
[5:22] in your soul you're you're you're
[5:24] believing god you're you're you're a
[5:26] believer i mean you're in your spirit
[5:28] and in in your in your spirit realm
[5:30] there's there's battles and things the
[5:32] greatest battle ever fought but down on
[5:33] the inside his seed remaineth in him
[5:36] that life is there and once that life is
[5:39] there you can't be lost you're you're
[5:41] you're you're sealed away because the
[5:43] seed remaineth in it it's it's in there
[5:46] now on the next slide brother brown said
[5:48] and he swore by himself and down now who
[5:51] is the seed of abraham those who are
[5:53] filled with the holy ghost are seeds of
[5:56] abraham
[5:57] because you've got the life
[5:59] the life is in you
[6:02] now the next verse we're just breaking
[6:04] down the things that paul preached about
[6:06] in the next verse in in verse 17 he said
[6:09] wherefore now what paul is getting into
[6:11] he's talking about how there's a there's
[6:12] a there was a gap between us and god
[6:15] there's there was something between us
[6:17] and now he god came
[6:19] and and and veiled himself in flesh and
[6:21] went through all of the acts and things
[6:23] of dying on the cross so that that gap
[6:25] could be closed so that we could be in
[6:28] oneness with god again
[6:29] and so paul's saying wherefore in all
[6:31] things that behoove them to be made like
[6:33] unto his brethren to come down and veil
[6:35] robe himself in flesh and to be like us
[6:38] and go through the same things that we
[6:40] get a headache and get get you know
[6:42] maybe have a a maybe have a cold and
[6:45] fevers and flus and whatever all the
[6:47] things of life
[6:48] so that he can know how to succour us as
[6:51] paul would say how to how to how to help
[6:52] us
[6:54] and he said that he might be a faith
[6:55] merciful and faithful high priest
[6:58] and things pertaining to god to make
[7:00] reconciliation for the sins of the
[7:02] people
[7:03] reconciliation is closing up that gap
[7:06] but how did he do it so paul's you'll
[7:08] find a lot
[7:10] a lot through he the book of hebrews
[7:11] paul talks about a high priest and and
[7:13] what what was the high priest now high
[7:15] priest was the he was the spiritual
[7:16] leader of israel he was the one that you
[7:19] know everybody would kind of turn to for
[7:20] guidance and now now think about all
[7:22] these types as they're typing christ
[7:25] he's the only one that could wear the
[7:26] urim and thumb the urine thumb which
[7:29] means it's kind of a strange word it
[7:30] means lights and uh
[7:33] um
[7:34] perfections i i drew a blank there for a
[7:37] second
[7:38] lights and perfections
[7:40] uh urum thumb so so on this on his
[7:42] breastplate he had those 12 stones and
[7:44] and if anybody had any question about a
[7:46] dream that they had or or um
[7:49] a prophecy to find out whether it was
[7:51] really true they would go to that high
[7:54] priest
[7:55] now now think about that now to find out
[7:57] whether whether something's true we go
[7:59] to the word which is christ so now we go
[8:02] we go to the word to find out whether
[8:03] things are true or not now back then
[8:05] they would go to the to the priests and
[8:07] they would say that
[8:09] the thing that had happened in front of
[8:10] that urim thumb or flash across there to
[8:13] indicate that it was true
[8:15] now and and then at the death of the
[8:17] high priest that you remember the
[8:19] stories of the this all the cities of
[8:20] refuge that if you had done
[8:22] killed somebody accidentally then you
[8:24] could run to that city of refuge and you
[8:25] had to stay there
[8:27] stay there until the high priest died
[8:29] but once the high priest died you could
[8:30] go free but now see when christ died on
[8:33] the cross we could all go free
[8:36] we we're maybe gonna back then you'd
[8:38] hide in that city of refuge and you
[8:40] you'd uh you'd you know you you couldn't
[8:42] go out of the city and it would be a bad
[8:45] situation for you maybe you'd want to go
[8:47] see your your family and your relatives
[8:49] and you had to wait until christ until
[8:51] the high priest died which was a type of
[8:53] christ
[8:54] and then again another thing that the
[8:56] high priest would do is every year he
[8:57] offered a sacrifice for himself
[9:00] and the people on the day of atonement
[9:03] now that's the major thing the that's
[9:05] the really the major thing that you
[9:06] focus on when you're talking about a
[9:08] high priest and paul would kind of he
[9:09] would reiterate that as he as he goes
[9:11] through hebrews that christ was our high
[9:14] priest
[9:15] and he he's the one that paid the pride
[9:16] now let's let's meditate on what the
[9:18] high priest would do on the day of
[9:20] atonement
[9:21] if we go to the next slide
[9:24] at leviticus chapter 16 it says he shall
[9:26] take of the blood of the bullock and
[9:28] sprinkle it with his finger upon the
[9:29] mercy seat eastward and before the mercy
[9:31] seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with
[9:33] his fingers seven times so and then it
[9:36] says then he shall kill the goat of the
[9:37] sin offering that is for the people and
[9:39] bring his blood within the veil and do
[9:40] with that blood as he did with the blood
[9:42] of the bullock and sprinkle it upon the
[9:43] mercy seat and before the mercy seat
[9:46] so that every year once a year everybody
[9:49] would be in great expectation for uh for
[9:51] the for the sin problem to be taken care
[9:53] of and so the priest the high priest on
[9:55] that on the day of atonement
[9:57] yom kippur once a year he would he would
[9:59] go in and out and that's that's the
[10:01] point that paul keeps making that christ
[10:03] died once for all
[10:04] once he every year the high priest had
[10:06] to do that over and over again but
[10:07] christ died once for all and he paid the
[10:09] paid the price so you don't have to keep
[10:11] doing things over and over you don't
[10:13] have to keep repenting you don't have to
[10:14] keep going back to camp meetings you
[10:16] don't he he prayed the price
[10:18] he did it once
[10:19] uh and and and so on every year the high
[10:22] priest would have to go through this
[10:23] this thing again and and then and then
[10:25] on that day he would go in and out four
[10:27] times in and out
[10:29] first of time he would go in to offer up
[10:31] the the incense which was a type of the
[10:33] prayers of the priests and the prayers
[10:35] of the saints offering up that incense
[10:37] and then he go out
[10:38] then he'd go in and offer the blood of
[10:39] that bullock and he'd sprinkle it seven
[10:41] times and that was a type
[10:43] of of a that was to to to to cover the
[10:46] sins of the of the high priest and the
[10:48] priests
[10:49] and then he would go and they would do
[10:51] remember the scapegoat he would they
[10:52] would they would he would go back out
[10:54] and they would
[10:55] they had their two goats and they would
[10:57] cast a lot and see which which coat
[10:59] would go free and carry your sins away
[11:00] into the wilderness and which goat would
[11:02] die and its blood would be sprinkled on
[11:04] the mercy seat
[11:06] now both times for the bullock the
[11:08] bullock and the goat that they with the
[11:10] blood will be sprinkled he'd go into
[11:11] that mercy seat and sprinkle it seven
[11:14] times
[11:15] ephesus smyrna thyatira on down until
[11:18] you get to lay out a sea and he'd
[11:19] sprinkle it because that blood on the
[11:21] mercy seat the most where's the mercy
[11:23] mercy seat where god is tabernacling
[11:26] himself
[11:27] and so when that blood is on the mercy
[11:28] seat is paying the price for you why
[11:30] what's paul talking about so you can be
[11:32] reconciled
[11:33] so that you cannot not be separate from
[11:35] god
[11:36] so that you can
[11:38] like like what we were just talking
[11:39] about that had the seed of abraham
[11:41] living in you so that christ can come
[11:43] and dwell in you so the price had to be
[11:46] paid and all these things that that the
[11:47] high priest was going through were a
[11:49] type of what christ did for us and
[11:51] that's what paul's laying out he's
[11:53] trying to
[11:54] express to the hebrews that we're not
[11:56] just believing in some fable
[11:58] we're believing in something and you
[12:00] really when you begin to meditate on all
[12:02] these complex intricacies in the old
[12:03] testament the way that the the veil was
[12:06] made and all the things that were in the
[12:07] veil and all the things that were made
[12:09] in the tabernacle
[12:10] all these things were speaking of christ
[12:13] and it just when the when the word
[12:14] begins to be revealed to you all this
[12:16] mystery begins to be unfolded that we're
[12:19] not just believing in some fable
[12:21] we're believing in something true it
[12:24] because it that mystery unfolds into
[12:26] something real that we know because
[12:28] because not just because it's
[12:30] because it's been revealed to us and
[12:32] because everything just ties together so
[12:34] perfectly into just a great big harmony
[12:37] of truths laying there in the scripture
[12:40] about how he sprinkled seven times and
[12:42] about what the the scapegoat means and
[12:45] and
[12:46] you think too
[12:47] christ christ typed he typed not only
[12:50] the sacrifice the sacrifice dying there
[12:53] and his blood being shared and sprinkled
[12:55] on the mercy seat but he also typed the
[12:57] high priest so he's typing he's
[12:59] fulfilling everything the whole picture
[13:02] is christ
[13:05] then shall he
[13:06] kill the go to the sin offering that is
[13:08] for the people and bring his blood
[13:09] within the veil and do with that blood
[13:11] as he did with the blood of the bullock
[13:13] and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat and
[13:15] before the mercy seat
[13:16] now
[13:17] on the in the next if we go to the next
[13:19] slide so to make reconciliation for the
[13:22] sins of the people now what's
[13:24] reconciliation
[13:25] in romans chapter 8 verse 5 to 7 paul
[13:28] said
[13:29] again paul speaking he said for they
[13:32] that are after the flesh do mind the
[13:33] things of the flesh
[13:35] but they that are after the spirit the
[13:36] things of the spirit so there's there's
[13:38] an enmity problem there's a gap between
[13:41] you and god if you're carnally minded
[13:43] you're going to think about the world
[13:44] you're going to think they're so like
[13:46] like we were talking to the to the to
[13:47] the kids last night about the rich young
[13:49] ruler coming to jesus the rich young
[13:51] ruler wanted to be good he was concerned
[13:53] about being good but but if you're
[13:55] carnally minded there's there's no way
[13:57] to be good
[13:58] well if you want to be good the only way
[14:00] to be to truly be good is to have to be
[14:02] spiritually minded to have the the life
[14:05] of christ in you so paul's saying for to
[14:07] be carnally minded as death but to be
[14:10] spiritually minded as life and peace to
[14:13] be spiritually minded to have the mind
[14:15] of christ in you and when you receive
[14:17] the word and it's quicker than you it
[14:19] will transform your mind so that you you
[14:21] don't love the things that you used to
[14:22] do
[14:23] that's why paul said because the carnal
[14:25] mind is enmity against god
[14:27] for it is not subject to the law of god
[14:29] neither can neither indeed can be
[14:32] it's not subject to the law of god but a
[14:35] spiritually minded is what's what is
[14:36] subject to the law of god when you're
[14:38] subject to the law of god you begin to
[14:39] kind of get under under the headship of
[14:42] the word and so if the word says you
[14:43] need to dress a certain way or do a
[14:45] certain way then you start doing that if
[14:47] the word says you need to you need to
[14:48] come to church and be seated around
[14:50] fellowship with other people you begin
[14:51] to get under that and you begin you're
[14:53] under the authority of it because you're
[14:55] subject
[14:56] to the law of god
[14:59] now
[15:00] think about what reconcile means to
[15:02] reconcile somebody if we go to the next
[15:04] slide to reconcile means to restore
[15:06] friendly relations between so like you
[15:08] know if you've got a a man and a woman
[15:10] that they've been married for a long
[15:11] time and they kind of get begin to fall
[15:13] out of relation maybe maybe they get
[15:14] separated maybe they're going through a
[15:16] rough spot but then maybe they begin to
[15:18] think on
[15:19] well we've had we've had the children
[15:21] like brother ram told that story of the
[15:24] the mother and father that were looking
[15:26] at the little baby booties in the attic
[15:27] and they begin to they begin to realize
[15:29] that these children came from us from
[15:31] our union and they started getting
[15:32] reconciled reconcile means to to bring
[15:35] back together to bring back together in
[15:37] harmony he said
[15:40] it means to cause to coexist in harmony
[15:42] to make or show to be compatible so if
[15:44] you're reconciled you can walk together
[15:46] you can walk together in lockstep and
[15:48] really what we're talking about is to be
[15:50] to be able to have the same mind to
[15:52] think the same way that god wants to
[15:53] know
[15:54] what he wants what his purpose for us in
[15:56] our life is
[15:57] is to to to to be able to
[16:00] to to know how how to be born again and
[16:02] how to walk as a christian that god
[16:04] wants you to be adopted he wants you to
[16:05] be mature and all of those things that's
[16:07] being reconciled
[16:10] so brother brown and the lamb and the
[16:11] dove he said when this dove came from
[16:12] the heavens the meekest bird of all he's
[16:14] talking about there on when john the
[16:16] baptist was baptizing jesus
[16:19] he came to the meekest animal on earth
[16:20] on all the earth heaven and earth kissed
[16:22] heaven and earth kissed each other now
[16:24] there's reconciliation
[16:26] when heaven
[16:28] and earth
[16:29] can come together
[16:31] now you think about in matthew chapter 3
[16:33] john when john the baptist began to
[16:34] preach the bible says he started
[16:36] preaching the kingdom of earth is at
[16:37] hand
[16:38] and matthew chapter 4 when jesus started
[16:40] preaching the bible says he started
[16:42] saying the kingdom of earth is at hand
[16:44] now what does that mean it means that
[16:46] heaven
[16:47] and earth
[16:48] are coming together that they're
[16:50] reconciled so in heaven when the life of
[16:53] god is little dwelling inside you well
[16:56] first of all the life of christ the life
[16:57] of christ was dwelling in in that man so
[17:00] so heaven and earth kissed one another
[17:02] because they came together and then god
[17:04] puts that same life in you and it's
[17:06] reconciling he's
[17:07] reconciled so that heaven and earth
[17:09] could come together by the deeds that
[17:12] that high priest did by by his death on
[17:14] the cross that he he died for us
[17:17] now now there on the river jordan uh
[17:19] brother ram said heaven and earth was
[17:21] united together man and god was
[17:23] reconciled in one body the lord jesus
[17:25] christ
[17:26] it was the god of heaven in the form of
[17:28] dove the god of heaven in the form of a
[17:30] dove and the son of god in the form of
[17:32] lamb and there they came together right
[17:34] there on the river jordan
[17:36] type in something reconciliation now
[17:39] reconciliation runs all through the
[17:40] bible and you might remember this from
[17:43] the teaching on the on daniel 70 weeks
[17:45] but we'll go to the next slide what's
[17:46] the what's the third fold of the
[17:48] six-fold purpose to make reconciliation
[17:51] for iniquity so the 144 000 are there
[17:54] they had they had uh
[17:56] you know they began to recognize what
[17:58] what had happened that they killed the
[18:00] messiah
[18:01] and and and you know what iniquity is is
[18:03] when you when you when you come you're
[18:05] faced with what you should do and you
[18:07] walk away from it or what you should not
[18:09] do and you say
[18:10] well i don't i'm not going to do that
[18:12] but there there's and and how many of us
[18:14] have
[18:15] we we've done wrong in our life we've uh
[18:17] you may you know you you've been face to
[18:19] face with what you should do and you
[18:21] didn't do it but there's got to be a
[18:23] reconciliation for that now the
[18:25] reconciliation for the jews is the two
[18:27] two prophets begin to preach and they
[18:28] begin to preach a word that opens up
[18:30] their eyes and they begin to wreck be
[18:32] reconciled and they're full of the holy
[18:34] ghost and it brings them back to harmony
[18:36] with god they recognize what god did for
[18:39] them
[18:40] now brother brahman the sixth full
[18:42] purpose of gabriel's visit to daniel he
[18:44] said to make reconciliation for iniquity
[18:46] iniquity is doing wrong as it did as it
[18:49] did they did at the cross
[18:51] they didn't they they put him on the
[18:52] crowd they put the word on the cross and
[18:54] that that's that's a good definition of
[18:56] iniquity
[18:57] they said he said he made
[18:58] reconciliations but it will not be
[19:00] applied to them it was not applied to
[19:02] them why because they were blinded and
[19:04] could not see it and why did they blind
[19:07] well maybe today because i'm blind
[19:09] you're willfully blind they were blind
[19:10] because of god blinded them but you're
[19:12] blind because you're willfully blind
[19:15] there's no reconciliation for you if you
[19:17] believe not that i am he said jesus
[19:19] you'll die in your sins that's right
[19:22] so reconciliation means to to bring back
[19:25] to to bring back in harmony with god to
[19:28] to join things to to to to to reconcile
[19:31] a relationship it's talking about
[19:32] relationship
[19:34] god wants us to have a relationship with
[19:36] it with himself
[19:38] now if we go to the next slide in
[19:39] colossians chapter 1 verses 19 to 22 it
[19:42] says
[19:43] for it please the father that in him
[19:45] should all fullness do well
[19:47] and having made peace through the blood
[19:49] of his cross
[19:50] by him to reconcile
[19:52] all things unto himself
[19:54] by him i say whether they be things in
[19:57] earth or things in heaven and you that
[19:59] were sometimes alienated and enemies in
[20:02] your mind by wicked works your mind
[20:04] wasn't thinking right
[20:06] yet now have you reconciled he's
[20:09] reconciled you because now you're
[20:11] thinking right and you're doing right
[20:13] and you know what the message is for and
[20:14] you know what your purpose is for and
[20:16] he's but he's put that life in you the
[20:19] same life that god had aided abraham
[20:22] in the body of his flesh through death
[20:24] to present you holy and unblameable and
[20:26] unreprovable in his sight
[20:29] brother brown said you come god's way
[20:30] through reconciliation by the blood
[20:33] and then become a son or daughter and
[20:35] daughter of god
[20:36] then all things are possible then
[20:39] miracles are possible then a revival is
[20:41] possible
[20:42] you believe that this morning
[20:45] then because the price the way back has
[20:48] been it's like it's been it's heaven and
[20:50] earth has come together and you can get
[20:52] back now you can get back to what adam
[20:54] and eve lost
[20:55] a way has been made
[20:57] so now we've got we've got so many great
[21:00] promises and if we go to the next slide
[21:01] we've got confidence that for in that he
[21:03] himself has suffered being tempted he is
[21:05] able to sucker them that are tempted so
[21:08] he came down to be like us to go through
[21:10] the same things and now he's able now
[21:12] sucker means assistance and support in
[21:15] times of hardship and distress and
[21:17] brother brown said sucker means to
[21:18] sympathize in other words god is able to
[21:21] help us out
[21:22] because he knows what we've gone through
[21:25] now i was i was kind of just meditating
[21:27] on this the other night and you know
[21:29] there's a lot of things that people go
[21:31] through that i i can't really sympathize
[21:33] with because you know i can't sympathize
[21:35] with with knee problems because i
[21:37] haven't really had knee pro i've had
[21:39] problems but not knee problems
[21:41] specifically there's a lot of different
[21:42] problems that i can't sympathize with
[21:44] but if you've gone through it if you've
[21:46] gone through somebody's problem if
[21:47] you've got migraines then you can
[21:49] sympathize with somebody that's got
[21:50] migraines now if you've gone through
[21:52] life
[21:53] like like
[21:54] let's talk about jesus he went through
[21:57] the problems he would like the bible
[21:59] says that he the son of man hath not
[22:01] where uh where to lay his head like
[22:03] foxes or bird the birds have nests and
[22:04] the foxes have dens but the son of man i
[22:06] have not where to lay his head he was a
[22:08] homeless person so he went through he
[22:10] went through knowing a lot of griefs and
[22:13] troubles and things now what that means
[22:15] is that when you go through troubles and
[22:17] trials you can you can have confidence
[22:20] that he's not looking at you like a just
[22:22] a uh like some like you know how a lot
[22:24] of people believe that god is
[22:27] it it doesn't want to get involved in
[22:28] your affairs that he's just kind of
[22:30] uncaring but we we believe in a high
[22:32] priest that can be touched by the
[22:34] feelings of our infirmities so what that
[22:36] means is brother brown said he had to
[22:39] become flesh to feel the pain of
[22:41] sickness to feel the temptation of lust
[22:45] to feel the temptation of want to feel
[22:48] the temptation of hunger to feel the
[22:50] power of death so that means young
[22:52] people that god knows what you're going
[22:54] through that means old people god knows
[22:56] what you're going through
[22:57] and you can have confidence when you
[22:59] come in prayer to ask anything of him
[23:01] that he's
[23:02] he's sympathizing with you he's not
[23:04] looking at you just like like at uncare
[23:07] he's not uncaring but he cares about you
[23:10] and and brother ram went on to say that
[23:12] he might take it upon himself to stand
[23:14] in the presence of the great spirit
[23:15] jehovah the spirit not the man the
[23:17] spirit to make intercession
[23:19] to this life you know what intercession
[23:21] means it means to do something about it
[23:24] it means to to get intercession means is
[23:27] is is like uh
[23:29] if if a bus is going to go off cliff
[23:32] let's use it and now forgive me just for
[23:34] a second but let's use a like a comic
[23:36] book analogy superman would jump in
[23:38] front of of a bus that's going off a
[23:40] cliff and get in the way of it now
[23:42] christ interceded for us he he got in
[23:45] the way of us going off the cliff and he
[23:47] he did that for us that's what intercede
[23:49] means that when you're when you've got a
[23:50] problem in your life he he gets involved
[23:53] he's not just a standoff god that that
[23:55] doesn't want to help right and the bible
[23:57] says and brother ram said and jesus took
[23:59] that in order to make intercession for
[24:01] us for he knows how it feels
[24:04] when you get sick he knows how you feel
[24:07] when you're tempted
[24:09] he knows how you feel
[24:11] now the next slide brother ram said he
[24:13] went on to say
[24:15] did you ever notice when we vote for a
[24:17] president every farmer will vote for a
[24:19] president that's been a farmer
[24:21] or he knows the hard part of the
[24:23] farmer's life so somebody a people a
[24:25] farmer wants somebody to represent them
[24:27] in politics that knows what they're
[24:29] going through so that we they can go to
[24:30] bat for them so that they understand the
[24:33] struggles of a farmer so we've we've got
[24:36] somebody that knows what we're going
[24:37] through so he can go to bat for us
[24:40] he can fight our battles for us he knows
[24:42] how to do it see he said he wants some
[24:44] man who understands and before god could
[24:46] ever understand him being that great
[24:48] holiness
[24:49] how could he ever understand after he
[24:51] condemned man
[24:53] by his holiness he condemned man
[24:55] and the only way he will ever know how
[24:57] to justify man
[24:58] is to become man
[25:02] so that's a lot of things packed into
[25:03] the first two chapters of hebrews
[25:06] let's summarize in the last few minutes
[25:08] we got now the book of hebrews was
[25:09] written to the hebrew church and in
[25:11] hebrews 10 we find out that it's written
[25:14] to some people that has suffered a lot
[25:15] of things
[25:16] so paul is really trying to encourage
[25:18] them
[25:19] and and it was written to separate law
[25:21] from grace and why why does law need to
[25:23] be separated from grace to show you that
[25:25] you're not saved by all the things that
[25:26] you do
[25:27] or by trying to be good but you're saved
[25:30] by the grace of god that he's given to
[25:32] you that you just believe on him and
[25:34] then he will transform your life not
[25:36] because you were good to begin with but
[25:38] because you believed on a god that's
[25:40] good and he changed you
[25:43] and so the goals of hebrews
[25:45] are are to elevate jesus to to bring to
[25:47] our mind that jesus is the one that
[25:50] wrote the old testament he's the one
[25:51] he's the author he's the one that wrote
[25:53] about all these promises he's the one
[25:54] that fulfilled the things that were we
[25:57] were just talking about the high priest
[25:58] and the sacrifices and all the all the
[26:01] uh the implements there in the in the
[26:03] tabernacle and it's to challenge the
[26:05] reader to remain faithful despite all
[26:07] the persecution now if we go as we go
[26:10] through the book of hebrews it's divided
[26:11] into four sections now chapters one and
[26:14] two compare jesus with the angels in the
[26:16] bible so as compared is saying he's the
[26:18] one that wrote all these things and he
[26:19] fulfills these things now chapters three
[26:21] and four compare jesus with moses and
[26:23] the promised land so when we start
[26:25] getting into chapter 3
[26:27] paul begins to say
[26:28] look at all the things as they were
[26:30] coming out of egypt
[26:31] they didn't go into the promised land
[26:33] because they failed to believe and he
[26:34] begins to compare christ with all those
[26:37] things that they
[26:38] the all the promises that were laying
[26:40] there and before them and in five and
[26:42] seven
[26:43] is comparing jesus with the priest and
[26:45] melchizedek who is this melchizedek that
[26:47] paul gets into to show that the life of
[26:50] christ the life that was in christ is
[26:52] that same life that talked to abraham
[26:54] and in chapters eight and ten come to
[26:56] compare jesus with the sacrifices and
[26:58] the covenant and all of those things and
[27:00] and when you get into chapter 11
[27:03] he lays out all these great models of
[27:05] faith that we can compare look at look
[27:07] at how all these abraham and moses and
[27:10] and sarah and all the different ones
[27:12] they there they were a model to us to
[27:13] look at to see these conquered and
[27:16] overcame by faith now look at what you
[27:18] can do by faith as they overcame by
[27:20] faith what about you
[27:22] and knowing that despite all the
[27:24] hardship and all the persecutions and
[27:26] musicians can go ahead and come forward
[27:28] and we'll close the despite that despite
[27:30] hardship and persecution
[27:32] god will not abandon his people amen so
[27:34] the whole book of hebrews is encouraging
[27:36] i believe in an encouraging gospel we've
[27:38] got something that should build our
[27:40] faith up
[27:42] god bless you
[27:45] [Applause]
[27:55] you
