scriptures turn to Ephesians 1 Ephesians 1 remember of our way of announcements the the Bible study will be the first Saturday and in November and remember also that will be the children's time the weekend and the things are doing so get everything ready for that and what your ducks will still be having the Bible studies regular 6 o'clock and also you just had every what your part will be in you make sure and get that to do the phone ship meeting - will be at brother Tony's on the third Saturday and just being tired for that alright let's see oh brother Louise is he here today he's must be in the back within the Lord willing if he's gonna be here Wednesday he'll be ministering for us in the word of the Lord so I think that's all of the announcements I'm trying to get them I write them down and a lot of times I can't read my own writing so that's that's not hard for me but I mean just remember these things the other announcement you got that one o'clock Fall Festival next Saturday is the Fall Festival so remember that and get everything in order and all in line okay anything else father we thank you for your grace and your love Lord and to us don't thank you for the opportunity to be able to come together that we can just set down for a little while and fellowship together around your word and be able to feast upon you and that you're a light shine in our hearts enough we pray that you would just got each and every one of us keep us in your love remember those that are not with us today for the different reasons and things we will brother Richard or when traveling back home today and thank you Father for the opportunity to be able to live in a day that we could see a miracle taking place right among us and just see you manifesting yourself in Dale's life we ask you to just continue it on Lord have your way to remember all the others that are sick among us and guide us you said you sent your word and healed us and we believe you forgive our sins will cleanse us and keep us in Jesus name Amen you know brother Branham said one day said you talk about a miracle you know we all want miracles we want something happen instantly miracles but he said when you've got to stay there and hold on and it takes time there to do and the things that could be testified today of what Dale Roberts has went through the word that he knows people's names he knows all kind of things voices he knows all of it he can in do things and talk to him through the little thing they got in this tube guy and it's it's an amazing thing to just consider the things that are happening so that's greater than a miracle you know or the miracles instant we all we want that but when you've got to just gradually take it if God gives it from day to day he just gets better and better and better going now somewhere to 1214 hours without anything connecting to the machine and as far as I understand when they got the machine owner is actually not working it's not doing anything you don't all that's just hooked up during cases needed but to do that and God is with us and we're thinking thank you Lord for your your healing in your deliverance in Jesus name okay seasons one called an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the grace of the glory of hid to the praise of the glory of His grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the blood in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace we're in he hath bounded toward us and all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation now what is the mystery of his will prophet said to adopt us what that in the dispensation we're not nowhere dispensation listen we believe it we're in the life dispensation all right said that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who has trusted in Christ in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory you may be seated the Lord had his blessing to the reading of the word you could take Ephesians 1 and preach till eternity off of this and we may do it a little that's not right but we just finished our series on the statue of a perfect man and through there we kept constantly talking about explaining it you know trying to bring out like faith virtue knowledge temperance patience from Peter and then come over to Paul and pick up you know the adoptions and the things of his wording and bringing forth and where he would talk to the Galatians about you know the the fruits of the spirit is love joy peace all of that time together showing that Paul and Peter were both saying the same thing they were teaching the growth development of the Christian all right now so into that we you know we were thought we'd drop off of it but it just keeps coming back so we'll deal with adoption for a little bit to try to make sure in its I'm saying this with the honor and glory the Bible said in the mouth of two or three witnesses let everything be established well we talked about that Paul priests adoption well that's what Peter was preaching is just different wording you know and then brother Branham comes along to preach so there's your one two three well wait he no he just finished a little bit back to our own own adoption and things and in doing and then brother Bob's been down in the Sunday School class teaching Sunday school and talking about adoption so you know we just we just keep all that relating seemingly right around the connection of the time that where we're at now here's one thing I want you to really listen listen because this is what we're going to be talking about for some time so the random said that our biggest problem was what looking back we're looking forward right and failing to see comprehend understand what is taking place now all right now I'm gonna say this in the right way I hope it'll come out right do you say but I just don't see nothing well if you was back there in the Pais you didn't see anything because if you did you'd be ready to listen now all right so you didn't see anything dire you know what I mean move us back six months and then moves back 30 years move us back 50 years it said well yeah we saw it in the profit but nobody else see you admits it just as much if you go forward well we're looking to this if this don't happen then we're not there see so the profit was right when What did he say this is where we live in we're not living the past we appreciate that thank God for all of the thunder looking forward to the future yes we have things that we look forward to look forward to the great anointing great thing all right I believe in all of it but if we don't stand where we're at then the future will do us no good because when we get to the future would just say we don't believe it no because that's what we're saying now I don't see it if you can't see these things that's what I was just thinking about there the other day been thinking about it all this week there that the Prophet said you know the greatest miracle and to think what Dale Roberts has went through if you'd see pictures and seeing what was dire you know and now he's talking he's doing all kind of funny not wanting a hamburger he keeps requesting that hamburger and I don't think they can get it through the tubes but that's what he wants is a hamburger he can tell him it's too hot you can tell him everything he's talking to him you know her if you'd have been there when I was and see him laying there then you'd have to do is I done to turn to the wall and say Lord we commit it to you cause ain't nothing one of us can do he's so far gone until they said you know yourself and I was dark when the doctor said it it's a date no hope I said this thing no hope it's at this case we've proven that with this form and the doings and the age and the part he said they might live a year you know but he says there's just no no part he wanted to pull the plug as he we call it you know and pull off the life support well you know she says no and now he's doing all of these things I wonder what that doctor is doing right now I'd like to run into him in the hall wife sometimes ask him how he's feeling but you know okay he was doing his medical terminology so I going off on him and he was writing what he wasn't saying but see he didn't know God could move on the scene and start just okay setting up bringing him out letting him set up letting him do all kind of things it's just you know talk to Aaron and there's some of these about the things talked to Anna about it to where you know that you can just it's amazing okay all right because we believe in it that's what I'm saying down these thoughts that I'll be trying to make for quite a while will be based based upon what is taking place not what will take place or what has taken place alright so remember that you know and this think on these things okay now in adoption your profit called it I run series of it years ago and and things and tried to to cover the natural stories of adoption and things like that you know in doing it but just to cover it the way the Prophet brought it that in the Old Testament there was a time called adoption that a child a boy you know now sorry sisters who don't cover sisters this covers boys no it's done to cover that see we're in a different dispensation alright in this one it's for women and men you know it's not just for the men okay so don't try to diss Kurt get discouraged or excuse the fact of saying well we don't have to do this we we're women and you know that don't work it's all in the body because that's why I was reading Ephesians that were brought where Paul covers all of us Jew and Gentile you know into this Ephesians to show you because he really technically the first or the thought of adoption was for Israel the scripture you know pertains to adoption literally is made it related to Israel because it was a natural thing they had the natural story of adoption they went through that in their families they done that before Jesus Christ came into the existence they had the the adoption are the what Bar Mitzvah hey I got clothes on there yeah and I can pronounce that word sometime all right but we were there in Israel and had an opportunity to view this taking place their own one of the accounts of where we were there in Israel when this boy was going through his ceremony and everything standing there on in an area so we happened to be able to walk by and we saw that and it was great you know alright but now to think about it they had something in order of the natural things all right they had a natural situation that they would do that would do the child was born into the family all right he was part of the family but he was not positioned in the position of understanding our authority and whatever and he was given a tutor or a trainer you know and say we cover some of those customs today and do some of those things and put our children under teachers or tutors and things like that you know to help them and that's what they had back there all right then when the child came up to the basis of of age-wise or whatever really really wasn't age it would be maturity as to being used more than anything and if you've got a Scofield Bible I'd like for you to just read or I'll read it right here from it on this word of adoption to where that will love be able to understand this great big old long word means placing as a son now listen to what Scofield says it means it's not so much a word now this big ol long word for the adoption is not so much a word of relationship as of position you got Scofield Bible you can read right down on the left inside the page where you learn in the seasons the believers relationship to God as a child Reserve results from the new birth all right whereas adoption is the act of God whereby one already a child is through Redemption from the law placed in the position of an adult son the indwelling Spirit gives the realization of this in the believers present experience okay because it goes from over into love joy peace but the full manifestation of the believers sonship awaits the resurrection now listen the full manifestation of the believers sonship awaits the resurrection the change the translation of the Saints which is called the redemption of the body all right so then see the word very word itself for therefore adoption shows what that was so I was born a child born into the family raised up awhile been given a tutor you know and that tutor trained that child to try to instill into the child the nature of the father and then they would would come forth as to having their ceremonies and the things you can take it if you're real careful over to Joseph and his coat of many colors and the showing that he was the chosen one among but just remember now in the natural story of the adoption probably each one of the children of Jacob and them was adopted naturally it would have been you know as they become to their maturity point but then you would how Joseph being picked as the the son you know to be the extra and you can use that as an example because it comes forth more into you and I can't remember what it does it doesn't make adoption doesn't make or did not make a child of child of the family they were born to child of the family all right they were born that child of the family it only made them positioned positionally further their maturity and with that went things that they had are enjoyed because we know the profits covered it if they if they and I'll read them to you if they matured all right they received those things but if they didn't mature they remind a child but they remind a child without a position or authority are are the the staff of a CEOs the the things that was given to the son as he came to that position all right but now that's what I want you to look at there's reason I want to approach it as the adoption to the whole point because he in that you have no example after that in other words that son was a son that was it you ended your adoption or taught in the Old Testament okay everybody follow me now in the Old Testament your type was or what happened was the son was born into the family and then the son was positioned of authority into the family but it didn't run on over and deal with what we would want to do with in the natural of trying to make some form of inheritance it's not dealing with that there in the Old Testament cause it only dealt with those two things born into the family positioned maturity alright maturity but now maturity then speaks of doing and that's what I want you to think about see then Paul could pick up the Old Testament the whereas maybe Peter in second Peter with you know he had his great understand he brought what God wanted this to house but he didn't go in through the adoption little stages of things in in his teaching all right because maybe he didn't understand that but Paul knew the Old Testament rules and regulations they don't anything else he knew that the ends and out of the Old Testament he knew about the law and what it means and what it was doing and he tried to bring that over into the New Testament all right see Peter couldn't have went back you get my point Peter couldn't went back and necessarily brought you over from types and shadows he didn't deal with types and shadows he dealt with literal wordings faith perks or knowledge temperance patience got in this thing he that was literal wordings that was bringing forth and showing what was to be able to taking place whereas Paul was dealing with the positional things or the growth development of that child to that position but now remember this this listen and it'll help you later on as we try to say and you say well what I meant was that now see you had your stages of the new birth you can type that with Paul as he'll do in a minute now but there must be something to move on because if we don't catch the story we will wind up and get into a position and be like we was that I said and the warning was what looking back looking forward see we'll come up to a position to where we will freeze on the point of doing instead of seeing that the more of what needs to be seen as you bring from the Old Testament over into the New Testament and how that is amplified magnified glorified into the putting of the word to show us where we're at and watch to take place now all right because see you've got that authority back there that Old Testament child had that authority given to them to place them as sons and daughters of God but now whereas Paul carries it and that's why I read that the Paul carries it on into a greater thing now you get what I'm saying listen in the Old Testament you never come to a resurrection I mean you had a son and you had authority in the examples but isn't it stopped Paul carries it into the resurrection right that's what we were reading here we're pulses that were asked to covering through the resurrection to the change of the body there's things in the New Testament see that are not in the Old Testament all right so as we're dealing with it don't get froze between and so which ones that would the once we cross the stage we cross into the New Testament and in our New Testament thinking will be based upon that and you'll find a lot more interesting story than to just read a story of what a child was back there you might see that act out on the play and like I said we've got to see it they were doing things and had bread and had different things and and best I remember they might have been a young girl or two it was about three or four people because we were standing at a wall and they were doing that all right but now listen to what I'm saying them when you got an example a top a top can only work to a certain position that's my whole point Paul can take that though and see that type back there and bring it into the New Testament dispensation and take you further than to just be birth Authority oh that's wonderful birthing authority and that's great in the body of Christ it's great to see Christ living among us but this is not the end in the New Testament adoption doesn't end in the New Testament with just a maturity I know the world waiting we know all that we'll get to it waiting on the manifestation of the sons of God right but still there is things to happen after then there's a change there's a resurrection there's great things to take place there in the adoption all series all right now so getting the point now let's let's think about it Paul as I said he picks this up now and he's using the top he's making the tops and shadows out of it showing what it means so he's Paul is going we're gonna read these where Paul is going to be relating that this is a birth this is a maturity it'll be in his right so let's go ahead and pick up the talk and get started on it then so let's go to go ahead a number of one a which is galatians 4 excuse-me relations 3 now watch Paul take this example explain the example show the tops ok then he'll take it into a higher form than she just stopped on that if he didn't owe you and how would be the new birth and your your authority see now Paul explains that but then he takes it into the change and the things later on in his writings but we have to cover it to where we can understand what's now but before faith came we were kept under the law in other words that's under the Old Testament shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed okay which would be Jesus Christ coming were for the law and the once was our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ that we might be justified by faith well now Paul is explaining the Old Testament that's that's this schoolmaster was the Old Testament former tutor all right now he's explaining that to bring it into order for us to see honor would you realize that here's where brother branham's he covers things that people they don't want to listen to we talk about the law bringing us to Christ brother branham Center denominations was a schoolmaster to bring us to Christ oh no we don't want not to do it alone you don't want nothing to do with what brought you to Christ so you go blow a nice overthrow you you blow our mind because we're getting settled in what we're thinking and then you flop us with something like that we don't believe any of their emanations being able to anything not to the nominations god of the age and time that was being lived you don't believe that they was a diet a time when the Lutheran's was the Word of God you don't believe that the Methodists that one day was the actual working of God see that's what I'm saying brother Branham will say things and all it takes is a word to collect you know to click it in the right place then he'll save them denomination to the schoolmaster see then we would get all confused the instead of listening to what he's saying are getting the understanding of what he's saying and then watch or for the law and what about the law being your schoolmaster the law was spiritual we are the ones in the corner the law was the Word of God but we don't want nothing to do with law with the will blender of that law stuff the law was what brought you to Christ you had no knowledge of sin without the law come on then we just take something and we we just throw it out and we think we understand instead of listening and thinking about what is being said Paul the law was our schoolmaster you know that actually the law the perfect Word of God now brought Christ into existence don't throw away the law come on church we still believe in the law I still believe I shall not kill thou shalt not steal thou shalt not lie I still believe that don't you you think we're coming to the new testament so it's okay for us to do all these time Paul said the law was spiritual well I don't know I so love it when you don't know what you're talking about the law was the Word of God brother Branham said the ten commandments was God in letter form you need that one God in letter form okay cuz now listen if adoption was not had been taught in the Old Testament you would not have something for the New Testament to top off of right but it was taught perfectly to her that it would come forth are naturally into an example for us but never never do away let her run said that law see what we think law is dirty words you know law we're not under the law we're under grace we weep and then the Prophet say that your denominations was a schoolmaster placing it like the law was a schoolmaster that was the law school master the law was what led you to Jesus Christ Paul said I had not known sin had the law not said thou shalt not covet listen wherefore the law is our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ how did you get to Christ cool how did you get to cross I started getting to it by the law within you didn't get that cuz that's what the scripture says no you're gonna argue in the inside the scripture says plainly right there in front of you that allows our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ something had to bring us to Christ a knowledge of sin a conviction was brought forth by the law but there was nothing back there to be able to take it any further would this become condemnation but Paul picks it up to take it and explain what happened in Jesus Christ truth in the law was our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ I thought brother Brennan says it Leslie how did he place it the I thought he said two prophets brought the word I thought the prophets were the laws and he said they was one that brought the word right not change our thoughts about sometime look but after that faith has come in other words after you gets a new birth now we're no longer under a schoolmaster once you get the new birth you're not under a schoolmaster the schoolmaster is dwelling within you you're not under a book of rules the rules would come into our heart as a revelation of Jesus Christ where we're the children of God by faith in Jesus Christ not a lineage and then what he's explaining it's not a lineage it's not this that any of it it's in Jesus Christ where as many as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ now watch him as I said a moment ago see there is neither then what Jew the Greek neither bond nor free there's neither male nor female for you are all one in Christ if you be Christ's then you're Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise the Paul is going to take the Old Testament adoption of the natural ciao and explaining that that that natural child gets a tutor a schoolmaster the word is interchangeable if from the hour down to the word schoolmaster to be used in the next verse it's an interchangeable word don't worry about I've looked it up don't think well it was a schoolmaster here but it was that over here now it's a tutor it's a schoolmaster the law was our tutor to bring us to Christ it was our schoolmaster to hold us until Christ could come to give us the new birth right so that wasn't a dirty word so Paul what are you doing all right what I'm doing I'm trying to tell you that those things are that Old Testament happening of the adoption that you're wanting to talk about you know it's correct a child is a child when it's born a child and then its maturity comes into its life and until that does it's given a tutor to bring it to the place of raising it and the tutor is the law a school last year now come on words none of us didn't like our school teachers when they got rough right you know we thought this all means but today we finish school we look back and said thank you to the teacher right especially if you wanted to advance further and go on in life you know and do it but get what I'm saying Paul is using an example to explain what happens in the fact that Jesus Christ had to come and die because the law could hold us but it couldn't deliver us it couldn't set us free more we got out of it the more we've done this and done that and didn't do this then do that that didn't save us at all those things spoke of it well now watch what he says go ahead a number to the next one one be there always no one got the 181 B that means is it added later and watch we just finished verse 29 of the third chapter now we go to the fourth now I say that the air as long as he's a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all now he's explaining the son that was born a son the child that's born the son he's not explaining the authority in this he's explaining sonship and explaining the new birth the new birth is what makes us sonship right now listen now I say that the heir in other words there's a man he's got a child he's got every right to the inheritance he's a child of the father he's born into the family he's ready for things correct his papers is correct he's in the ladies he's in everything but now watch him even though he's err he's got a problem as long as he's a child he can't claim that relationship he can't claim Authority as long as he's a child so is it within you we get born again and in the body that's what brother Brennan said that's he said that's what people to do he said they they're born to get on Saturday night and said Sunday morning they're in the pulpit preaching have you heard him say that he said that's not right yeah but you go tell him he can't preach I didn't say that I said I'm gonna tell him that right according to the Bible I knew him just like I do the woman she comes look said well God called me okay that's between you and God Danny between me and you and God that's your problem I'm gonna stay with the word we ain't gonna let the preach no who sat down and listened the main thing alright alright so now watch what he's saying that the air even though he's born into the family now so even though now hold this point if we get to it even though you're born into the family by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that gives you eternal life makes you a child of God that can never be taken from you but that's not all the word is trying to deal with there's more to it than that okay so look so that the air in other words the rightful owner air as long as he's a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all but he's under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the Father he's under schoolmaster the same word appears here back it's the same word he's under a tutor than words we never have been through that to know that much about it but a lot of people you know they they take a tutor they they send her child to a school and they put a tutor over that child to train that child and bring that child up to positions and things and all like that ready they're still doing it around the country raising them giving them a tutor all right and it's a child so he gets the tutor now brother branham said God gave us a tutor at the baptism when the only go he said that's a grace to greatest tutor of all there's a new birth we'll see all that does now just puts us in the body across that's what brother Aaron said you Pentecostals made you a mistake he said thanking you got everything when you were born again he said now you just started well no wonder they didn't want him but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the Father you know what is the time of the father would finally say okay son he's you know the tutor would come in and say to the father now he's raised up it's time for his going through his ceremony and things because he he's writing then the father would check the that's under see if he had the nature well you know what I like about it in the natural I mean that's that's my way of thinking I've always said I don't want my kids to act like the neighbor you know a lot of times kids act like father and in mama you know then walking you ever notice you watch your kids sometimes and you'll see them they'll be walking and they're walking they look at walking just like you walk in they're acting like you're acting well you don't want them acting like the neighbor because you might think they wind up belonging to the neighbor right cuz they're acting like the neighbor well alright so the tutor would not you know the the father wouldn't give a tutor to raise the child to act like the neighbor he'd want him a tutor that would acting like him he wanted his nature how is it with you that have been in through these things and you had it or they put the tutor with you see actually their tutors when it passes of grades you know the class is not you that the tutor cuz that tutor instills into you what you supposed to answer the questions okay it's natural listening what is under tutors and governors now watch him even so we when we were children babies we're in bondage under the elements of the world in other words two parts first off if you just an hour without a birth you're under the elements of the world automatically not automatically under the elements of the world okay but now in the spiritual the tutor is not only to try to train you in the nature he's to try to help you to be able to survive in the world that you're living in right because that's what he's talking about we're in bondage under the elements of the world now to bring that up into a spiritual whether you like this or not that's all right put it in the seat of your britches and sit down on it when you start as a new birth you start as a baby I don't care if you're 80 years old you're a baby you know what you act like a baby right you think like a baby that's where the troubles that we try to take our thoughts like a baby and claim to be a dog and I don't need that old loner nothing I've never been I tell you what I've sanctified in feel the Holy Ghost I don't I don't need no law you might find out for this series it over that if that tutor was not a teacher of the truth of the law that was the nature that was wanted then the farmer wanted instilled into his son so it might be something that you won't listen so we when we were children we're in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to do what to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons if we don't get in the right lineage we can't have the adoption so what's the adoption first there's got to be a child first you've got to be born again then you come into the right of adoption in other words you start your maturity you're born again baby yeah like a baby cry like one you know a baby it's not that what we've taught is that not the way the Prophet is teaching the message of the hour and how that you're born as a child of God yes that gives you the new birth yes that gives you faith then Peter says now come on let's grow up and be adults Paul says let's get into adoption stages with it and see that adoption is the same thing Peter is talking about because you're adding faith works or knowledge temperance patience godliness coming out with love joy peace goodness meekness and all coming out with those virtues and Paul is telling you how to become an adopted son he's using the Old Testament as an example that that child is born into the family Metheny has to come through the maturity stages and have a tutor but if that tutor is not satisfied with the student the student don't pass the test brother Branham says now this is his word so I don't know whether that's I don't know whether that you say well okay that son and you you flunked this one so we'll send you back through again I don't read in the Bible where there's a back seat back in again okay maybe you can but I can't find that okay I can't find if I fail it here maybe I can make it over here alright you with me in other words if I can't follow it and come out as a true Christian I don't think being coming out of foolish virgins gonna help me you understand me there is no point of doing and if we don't make it in and brother branham now their wording is what he said if that child didn't become a child he said it stayed a child was that it had no authority now he doesn't cover there's a second stage that he can run back through that again if it is now you showed me I want you to bring it to me where he says you can start back over know it evident it was pretty strong like that child if he flunked the first one he didn't get a second change we try to make a lot of things in the word that's not in there all right now bank-owned these thing but see when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to do what to bring us to Christ Jesus Christ came to be the fulfillment of law he came to magnify the law uh how is it let's see this three-fourth honey he came to increase it's magnified you know of the law he didn't do away with the law Christ in the new birth that's what the Bible says Christ is the end of the law for righteousness if you're born again with you're not born again it don't work unless they don't think I try to put all these things in I know you said well you just give us such everything I try to give you the information enough to where you can understand if we don't make it in Gardo stage 1 are we gonna try stage 2 ain't gonna be satisfied I don't know what you think if I don't make it as the Bride of Christ I want I don't want to have to appear somewheres else right if I have to that's between God that's his business he can do what he wants to but I it's not up to me to do that I don't want nothing left over just in case this don't work right I remember years ago when we first started coming into the message and a lot of money started floating around well found out a lot of the preachers were sending their money to the foreign fields we're putting them in Western and/or eastern bank accounts what far just in case we don't make it you got any sent over there just in case you don't make it well ain't no we're not to plan just in case we don't like it that's up to God and his doing they left for us we've got one choice make it or not okay come on I won't charge you for that one all right to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption nopal covered it over in Romans we'll get to it later called it's the spirit of adoption see when you were born again you're given the spirit of adoption that doesn't mean your adoption is complete that means that you're given the spirit to carry you through making you a child of God all right now here what are we saying not back not forward the spirit of adoption is here now we're right now being concerned with whether or not we're trying to go up that statue of a perfect man that's what's happening right now that was not yesterday an hour tomorrow it's what's taking place now if we don't see him now in bad shape now listen this is one of one I like because your son's this one was in mass confusion four years ago I remember it because your son's God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your heart crying now by father because you are son well this signs out alone now it's nineteen seventy's well we've always been this well what we doing here now I mean if that be true what are we doing here fifty years later I mean after that point you know but listen we're for the art no more to serve it but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ what about it Paul what are you doing I'm taking the Old Testament of the example of a child born into the family made him a member of the family never can be disowned or taken out there in a member of the family all right then dealing with positionally placing you in adoption all right he said I'm trying to define that now with the scriptures because we've got to bring it up so he brings it up that the new birth makes you a child of God the new birth makes you with eternal life a child of God makes you an heir of all things as he'll cover in the Romans joint heirs with Jesus Christ wonderful thing to make you what God wants you to be which is his child Paul says now that adoption back there only put the son in the line of maturity or our business wise you know the things of given Authority it didn't change that child now come on listen to me for a second so that tutor Dyer had a hard problem because he was dealing with the nature of that child no back before Calvary and then I listened the child is born into the family but the tutor what do you think about that tutor having to try to raise that child without having anything to do with it because there was no new birth in the child there's only a natural birth right the child had a natural birth brought it into a member of the family gave it inheritance right because there were certain things that would be left that's why I love the story of the Bible to work that people don't never listen to what you take Jacob and Esau when he so finds out what's happened right he doesn't give it all the way itself would he find out what happened then he said Lord I suggest something for me you know there was right Jacob turned around to Esau and blessed Esau and made him as to be a great Authority and out of him would come great lineages and out of him would come great but read your Bible he just didn't bless Jacob they're just blessed he blessed he saw he saw got an inheritance he still got it over I right now he's doing a revs and then people it's got all the money that's making you pay three dollars a gallon to get here today huh you think he ain't got control of you go ahead and get you a motel I'm not against people in there I'm just telling it like it is now the Vietnamese went ahead of hitting the meters by the fall the chicken houses I don't know what they want them for but I mean that guy's really got a reason you go down to a motel you're gonna you go to a service station like I've always told you you say oh they can't do anything to us what if they said you would even recognize us or we won't sell you any more fuel you said that can't be done that can be done at any time what are you gonna do right if they own it you think they ain't behind us out there doing it too easy way they trying to fight us they just buying us out might be kind of like Russia since it will destroy you without firing a shot you know what they almost did had they demanded that today when Russia went underneath on the Christ market back under you know in lost their great country had they demanded the United States that day we would have been just as broke as Russia you think they ain't in control come on church I said okay I don't like to get on to that let's get off of that that's government I think I nothing to do with this well but listen Paul is expressing how important it is that you be born in an inheritance or a line and that puts you in a family and then he is expressing the authority that goes with sonship but he cannot express too much back there as two types of them things because it only ends with natural authorities right and the Old Testament it was just natural authorities it had nothing to do with why Scofield even picked it up he said that doesn't deal with resurrection yeah now Paul has happened to take the Old Testament an amplified magnified and deliver it and its way of delivering it was or what we just read in Galatians three and four that he's coming to show you that we have to get borned again to be in Christ for Christ to be in us we have to have the new burrow that makes us a child of God that puts us in right of inheritance with the father makes us right to where we're supposed to be but now he's saying you must have these other things that goes with it the authority is not dealing with this Authority - to have authority to be able to speak this into existence or that into existence so that's what everybody wants an adoption hey I remember I got a plan on the destined there now cuz I remember it and run some of them up I'm Dan you know called nothing girl to say it people were saying back in in the 68 and 69 Oh when we get into millennium we're gonna have manifested sons and daughters well anybody with one-eyed and highest senses brother Don rubber used to say I mean that's plain language that was his way of saying it anybody one-eyed and I said it sort of know that in the millennium you know that's fine the brother branham said we don't need it in the millennium he said we need it now he said we'll be in glorified bodies we'll see they were saying laughter I remember quoting that and they just what they didn't like it you know they we need it now yeah we're gonna have it the millennium we don't we don't need these now with where we got this we got that in the Millennium where I said probably said we didn't we don't need it in the millennium we need it now it's been hard to fight out a lot of truce and if you you wouldn't think about that has been filed out over the years until you're hollered and scream about these things try to get people to believe it but Paul takes then the example into a higher order then he brings it forth of a new birth yes but then he takes it forth more as to showing us the authority that goes with that birth the growth development that goes with it the adoption that comes with it the authority that goes with the tutor to teach us and train us to bring forth the nature of the Father the schoolmaster to bring us to Christ and bringing Christ into manifestation into our hearts and lives you say yeah but we got the new bird let's see yeah I'm months and they're trying to get you to look at that in a point you got the new bird a man you get the new birth you're born again glory but that don't stop that just puts the baby here that just gives the baby life it's not necessarily that we won't thority that's the problem everybody wants Authority or power apart from character was what the probably said it's satanic but he said power with a character it fit through we don't never hear that one everybody wants Authority and they only look at Authority come on not yesterday not tomorrow gotta bring this to a close right here on this and then we'll start over later everybody wants to Turin tea they think that's the way you show things I think well you you show who you are about your authority or your ability to do ain't gonna argue about it cuz I can stand here the rest of the afternoon talk about things that God is doing and I ain't dragging I'm just telling truth about it we can talk about the dead raised the sit healed we've talked about storms spoken in out we talked about many different things that has happened among us we can talk about miracles is right in one way right up there now medellín him coming forth more each day they said well who prayed that there's the problem there's the problem we've got to have the authority what does it matter who prayed the prayer how many times have we taken a prayer cloth for somebody's needs and give it back and pass it among everybody here to let everybody pray even the children pray over the prayer cloth but see we've got what I prayed that Peyer well I'm just gonna say it whether you like it or not if that's the attitude you got you didn't pray the prior now argue all you want to and fuss you didn't pray the prior somebody else did I got one Amen because you see when you start saying that I I me me me that's not an adoption the nature of the father being in there sealed into the Sun is not the nature of the neighbor right are you with me are you thanking but you don't believe in in authorities and then I believe in the greatest authority of one time go ahead click it and do you see I believe in the opening of the word I believe that the greatest example won't put it on and will back up the greatest example of adoption is not your signs and wonders you're going wrong you're in the devil's trap because in this day Satan can produce okay I believe the greatest sign that there is of an adoption is the word that's revealed to you that were in a day when all of this is falling apart until about the people of the message tell me this fall in the park Church is just people leaving just what did you stand there and say that ain't got nothing doing me they all fall away then I'll just praise God keep going what about you you gonna quit cuz everybody else quit I didn't start coda started what about it what would be the greatest what did brother Branham say what if the Bible say it will probably give you a signing to come to pass you better hear the prophet amen that's one scripture what about the second if the prophet gives you a sign and it comes to Pais and he leads you to another God don't hear him because I sent that among you to try you is that Bible give me somebody to stay with the word somebody just stay with the word it don't make no difference what anybody else says then we're not in the garbage can of everything and saying well this brother sewing so it's got this brother down on weenie we ain't none of that we're in one thing if the words are the power of God is automatically there give me that give me the word give me the word let me stay with it I told you of 40 years ago that they'd come a time that the denominations would be raising the dead healing the sick casting out Devils and that it would be in this message that people would be running after those doctrines and ideas I have no problem of saying I said it that's up to you to whether or not it's of God but let me they say it like this it doesn't matter whether some God or not if it worked now you don't like that and right come on you understand what I'm say if what I said is the truth even if I said it if the devil tells the truth he tells the truth you're going to be one of your prophets a tried by the what word see if you don't know whether or not the preachers preaching the truth where have you been studying God's Word come on musicians what about it we're just making a little point because my whole point is one thing I'll back it up to something that we're not gonna be back under then we're not gonna be over there we're gonna talk about what's here now and see if it's of God let's believe it if not then we just throw it away forget it I'll state my the final statement under this the greatest manifestation that they could ever be is a child of God to stay with God's Word in a time of all the troubles and heartaches and problems the times of all of the things following falling right and left and they just do it somebody just say thank God for the word but I love ain't nobody in the building lost feelings any better than this man I've told you I believe in them I believe that a baby that's got it in life is gonna have life about it you know what I'm saying if it's if it's alive it's gonna be alive we're gonna have emotions we're gonna have things amen called we believe in it but where is my emotion as opposed to being when it's compared to the word am I to check the word by my emotions and things and ideas are what's taking place or check it by what the Prophet said I say this with no disrespect I won't say it because I have been so guilty of bringing out things and exposing situations till you know I'll get water I don't believe it listen the greatest thing to know whether a child is the son or daughter of God is to how they deal with the word why did the prophets say he said they gave them the word test now how do you give the word test you know I know how y'all used to tell about giving the Pentecostal looking eyeball I discerned brother you out in ya but what is the greatest discernment that there is I thought the Bible said Hebrews 4 and way over that right that the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart what are we gonna try people by that comes behind preaches things to us what are you try it by but the words you've heard that's simple and then what do we do drama by the word see what to say what the prophet has to say oh but the dad was raised as sick was healed look at all these great miracles that's what the Bible said he said I'll do these things and send it among you to try you what a wonderful day let's time go ahead brother [Music] you [Music] [Music] if I have a name pass sweet [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] thinking [Music] Hey [Music] the throat of murder merci five
