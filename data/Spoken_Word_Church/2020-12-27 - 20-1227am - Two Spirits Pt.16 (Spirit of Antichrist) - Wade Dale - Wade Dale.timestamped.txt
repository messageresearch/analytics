[21:30] since we have a limited amount of space
[21:32] down in the fellowship hall
[21:34] what we're going to do is terrence has
[21:37] talked to a few of you but this is what
[21:39] we're going to try to do instead of
[21:41] packing everybody
[21:42] in and everybody being downstairs and
[21:45] getting ready for second service and
[21:46] some people are sitting downstairs now
[21:48] it's full so what we're going to do is
[21:51] rotate
[21:52] families eating out or eating your car
[21:55] or not eating
[21:56] in the saints in the uh downstairs
[22:00] in the fellowship hall so the first next
[22:03] sunday
[22:05] my family richard roberts family and
[22:07] terence's family are gonna eat out
[22:10] so we're gonna and you don't have to
[22:11] when we say eat out it means don't bring
[22:13] your food downstairs and eat in the
[22:15] fellowship hall you can sit in your car
[22:17] and eat you can sit outside if it's
[22:19] pretty you don't have to go
[22:20] out and eat you just will not be sitting
[22:23] at your normal
[22:25] table that you normally sit at but

[22:49] we were looking at this these are the
[22:52] normal people that stay

[22:55] every service and eat so we're not
[22:57] talking about you
[22:58] but these people can have their meals
[23:01] downstairs sit with your family
[23:03] we're still going to try to keep this
[23:05] thing where we can social distance as
[23:07] much
[23:08] as we can but families are going to be
[23:09] around each other anyway so may as well
[23:11] let the family sit with each other
[23:12] but my family richard's family intensive
[23:14] family will go out and eat next sunday

[23:25] will announce
[23:26] this coming sunday for next sunday the
[23:29] other three that's going to go out and
[23:31] if you want to go out that's fine it
[23:32] doesn't mean you have to stay this is
[23:33] but it means that if you normally stay
[23:35] here and eat which i do
[23:37] richard does and terrence usually does
[23:39] that we're gonna have to go out and eat
[23:40] and give a space for somebody to sit

[24:19] we're here and
[24:20] we're able to lift our hands up and put
[24:21] our feet on the ground and worship god
[24:23] amen and that's what the devil hates
[24:26] you don't hate anything else but you
[24:28] putting your feet on the ground and
[24:29] saying god thank you for another day
[24:31] amen because you know what he can't do
[24:32] anything about that until god's finished
[24:34] with you
[24:34] amen so it makes him mad so that's okay
[24:37] also now remember
[24:39] by way of some more prayer requests
[24:43] brother claude had his gallbladder taken
[24:45] out
[24:46] he has he had to have it drained because

[26:33] for this day you've given us an
[26:35] opportunity to stand before the
[26:37] purchased possession of your blood
[26:39] lord we pray now that you would take
[26:41] that blood and cover us lord you
[26:43] your word lord is what we long for more
[26:46] than anything else because that will
[26:48] destroy and defeat the devil every time
[26:51] if we'll just stay fortified
[26:53] behind that word lord that says by your
[26:56] stripes we're already healed
[26:59] and that you would give us blessings
[27:01] lord that from heaven that we can't even
[27:03] contain
[27:05] lord if we do what you said in the word
[27:07] father just be with us
[27:08] take care of us in the furtherment of
[27:09] the service be the ones that we've
[27:11] talked about here that are sick
[27:13] and the new year coming up lord on
[27:15] thursday the new year's
[27:16] service lord we pray that you'd be with
[27:18] brother william be with each one lord
[27:19] the singers and all the different ones
[27:21] that we'll have a good time in you and
[27:23] then lord will be taking communion there
[27:25] right at midnight father
[27:27] and lord we pray that our communion with
[27:29] you will not be with just wine and bread
[27:31] for the
[27:32] rest of this year until you come lord
[27:34] but it would be a communion of
[27:36] us and you father and as the prophet
[27:38] said in that
[27:39] secret chamber lord where you can speak
[27:41] to us lord sweet words into our ears
[27:44] father
[27:44] we pray that you just be with lord the
[27:47] ones that are
[27:48] sick around the world be the little
[27:50] bride lord keep her safe
[27:53] lord we ask you to bless this service

[27:56] you do the work today lord it will never
[27:59] fail if you do the work
[28:01] in jesus name we ask these things lord
[28:03] amen
[28:04] first john 4 we're going to talk about
[28:05] spirit of antichrist now
[28:08] we're going to bring it from spirit of
[28:09] antichrist up to a person
[28:11] today so just bear with me for a minute
[28:14] first john 4 verse 1 says beloved
[28:16] believe not every spirit but try the
[28:18] spirits whether they are
[28:19] of god because many false prophets are
[28:22] gone out into the world so here we've
[28:24] got a situation we know they're there
[28:26] they were there 2000 years ago when john
[28:28] penned this so they're here more now
[28:31] amen and i'll read to you i was
[28:34] researching some
[28:36] how many denominations in the world so
[28:37] you're going to be really surprised when
[28:39] i give you the number
[28:41] hereby know you the spirit of god every
[28:43] spirit that confesses that jesus christ
[28:45] is coming the flesh is of god and every
[28:47] spirit that confesses not that jesus
[28:49] christ has come in the flesh
[28:50] it's not of god and this is that spirit
[28:53] of antichrist
[28:54] everybody got that this is that spirit
[28:56] of antichrist
[28:58] because it has to start as a spirit
[29:00] right whereof you have heard that it
[29:02] should come
[29:03] and even now already is in the world
[29:07] working silently uh
[29:10] covertly among the people but remember
[29:13] everything we're talking about this
[29:15] antichrist spirit is gonna head up into
[29:17] a person that you're gonna be able to
[29:19] look at we're not the bride's gonna be
[29:21] gone but the world's gonna look at this
[29:23] beast
[29:24] this antichrist is not going to be a
[29:26] system anymore
[29:27] it's going to be a person it heads up in
[29:29] a beast
[29:30] all right it was a beast in the
[29:32] beginning it's going to be a beast in
[29:34] the end
[29:34] all right year of
[29:37] which is already in the world are of god
[29:39] little children have overcome them
[29:40] because greater he that's in you
[29:42] what a promise than he that's in the
[29:44] world they are of the world therefore
[29:46] speak they of the world and the world
[29:47] heareth them
[29:48] we are of god he that knoweth god
[29:51] heareth us
[29:53] he that is not of god hereth not us
[29:55] hereby know we
[29:56] look hereby know we the spirit of truth
[29:59] and the spirit of error you may be
[30:01] seated in the lord as blessing
[30:03] to the reading of the word let's read
[30:04] our uh quote that we've been reading for
[30:06] so many times here this
[30:08] be part 16. you ought to be able to
[30:10] quote it
[30:11] by heart says now remember this christ
[30:13] in the true church now what did we talk
[30:15] about the other day there was there's a
[30:16] true church
[30:18] there is truth but it's not scattered in
[30:21] many different directions there's only
[30:23] one truth
[30:24] there wasn't four jesuses on the earth
[30:26] there wasn't two jesuses on the earth
[30:28] there was one that stood up one day and
[30:29] said
[30:30] i am the way i am the truth and i
[30:33] am the life
[30:36] amen so where is that person there
[30:40] there now by the baptism of the holy
[30:42] ghost he's in me and you
[30:44] amen now we can't say that we're the way
[30:47] but we have the way
[30:49] amen we have the way i was thinking
[30:52] yesterday you know we
[30:54] uh there's so much uncertainty in the
[30:55] world and that's what you know
[30:57] we were talking uh meeting another guy
[30:59] the other day about fear
[31:01] the bible says fear bringeth torment and
[31:04] that's what the world's doing they're
[31:06] tormented by the fear not knowing what's
[31:07] going to happen tomorrow the next day
[31:09] the new administration coming in and all
[31:11] these different things that everybody's
[31:13] fearful of but you know what it struck
[31:15] my heart i said god
[31:17] i said you told me
[31:22] in the bible everything that was going
[31:23] to happen
[31:26] and you wrote it because you saw it
[31:28] already happen
[31:30] and now you're inside of me
[31:34] amen uh he's inside of you
[31:38] so what are we fearing we must look to
[31:40] the bible look to the god that we have
[31:42] called the holy ghost that guides us
[31:46] and you know what he'll tell us what's
[31:48] coming up next year he's already told us
[31:50] in the bible what's coming up
[31:51] right we got everything in place that
[31:53] needs to be
[31:55] and that person that knows everything is
[31:57] going to happen next year is inside of
[31:58] you
[31:59] and brother branham told us that we were
[32:00] prophetic people
[32:02] we look at the prophetic we look at the
[32:05] what's coming and you know what it's not
[32:08] something like i said before all the
[32:09] doctrines and we'll get into this just
[32:11] maybe
[32:11] a little bit and i may have to do one
[32:13] more service on this but you get into
[32:15] many doctrines of the denominations and
[32:17] like i said before you're going to be
[32:18] really
[32:19] uh well i'll just tell you now i wrote
[32:21] myself a note what is truth i looked in
[32:23] the
[32:23] on the internet there's 30 000.
[32:28] worldwide christian organizations
[32:33] 30 000
[32:36] with all different views
[32:41] now is our god that confused there's
[32:45] 1200 in the united states alone
[32:50] 1200 different
[32:53] christian organizations that one says
[32:56] that if you have a
[32:58] church on sunday you're the antichrist
[33:01] seventh-day adventist they read the same
[33:04] bible
[33:05] this one over here says this is the way
[33:06] it is or you or you're out this one over
[33:08] here says this is the way it is or
[33:09] you're out this one over here says you
[33:10] got to baptize
[33:11] this one says you can sprinkle this one
[33:14] says where
[33:15] there's no millennium and this one says
[33:17] there is a millennium this one says
[33:19] there's not this and then there's this
[33:21] is god that confused he can't be
[33:26] he's got to be there's then there's got
[33:28] to be the truth
[33:31] there's got to be the way the truth and
[33:33] the life
[33:34] and it's got to be the true revelation
[33:37] that's what we were talking about here
[33:38] says christ in the true church
[33:40] is a continuation of the book of acts
[33:42] we'll read the quote but the book of
[33:43] revelation shows how that an antichrist
[33:45] spirit
[33:46] would come into the church defile it
[33:48] making it lukewarm formal and powerless
[33:52] by what by their teaching
[33:55] by what they believe like i said before
[33:58] how many of you have have have heard
[34:00] many people in the past
[34:02] you know they say oh well mom's gone on
[34:05] and she's
[34:06] sitting at the feet of jesus or she's
[34:07] walking on the streets or going that's
[34:09] not true
[34:12] there's none of that in the bible they
[34:15] used to call them a wives tales
[34:17] because if it's not true it's gotta be a
[34:19] lie
[34:21] but thank god he sent us a prophet that
[34:24] went across the curtain of time says oh
[34:26] they're in a beautiful place they're in
[34:27] another dimension they're sitting over
[34:28] there in eternity
[34:30] but jesus is not there that's right
[34:35] we see him at his coming we meet him in
[34:38] the air
[34:39] now that's bible that's not fables all
[34:42] these other things are fables
[34:45] they tell you you can do certain things
[34:47] and it's not true in the bible well
[34:48] who's true
[34:52] many of these 1200 denominations have
[34:54] women preachers
[34:56] that ain't even bible
[35:00] sorry nothing against the women but the
[35:02] bible says
[35:04] a woman should keep silent amen
[35:09] and all these other things different
[35:10] things that's why i said before you look
[35:12] at this
[35:13] you think man how in the world did did
[35:15] god get that confused from
[35:17] a.d 30 when the man stood there and said
[35:20] i am the way i am the truth i am the
[35:22] life
[35:24] 120 in the upper room caught that same
[35:27] revelation
[35:29] with the by the baptism of the holy
[35:30] ghost right
[35:32] and took it to the world out of 120 then
[35:36] 3 000 downstairs
[35:38] and then bro zach by the by the second
[35:40] church age in about 8 100 here they
[35:44] start scattering
[35:47] here's sirenthis you know there's
[35:50] doctrines in the message now that jesus
[35:51] wasn't god to the river jordan he became
[35:53] god well that
[35:54] doctrine is not new that doctrine
[35:57] started back in
[35:58] about a.d 50.
[36:01] amen 86 the 80-70 brother bob brought me
[36:05] the
[36:05] the history on it where that cyrenthius
[36:08] was a
[36:09] was a they started preaching that jesus
[36:12] was not the substance of god he was the
[36:14] life substance of god well see that was
[36:16] a saying
[36:17] that's what we're going to get into in a
[36:19] minute that was a saying
[36:21] don't you think don't you think maybe
[36:24] that
[36:24] that just couldn't be gone he cried he
[36:28] died
[36:29] he had to eat that can't be
[36:32] gone but he can be like god he can be a
[36:36] second person
[36:40] see what i mean
[36:44] because we're going to talk about today
[36:45] with sayings deeds
[36:48] doctrine and then incarnate
[36:51] it's going to incarnate a person same
[36:53] way you by the baptism the holy ghost go
[36:55] through justification sanctification the
[36:57] baptism of the holy ghost
[36:58] and then god incarnate amen satan cannot
[37:02] satan cannot make that happen
[37:08] but he can duplicate it remember he's
[37:11] not an originator remember he's not a
[37:12] creator
[37:13] but he can get so close till the end
[37:17] time they're going to believe now
[37:18] in the end time there's going to rise up
[37:20] a man that they're going to think
[37:22] god almighty and human flesh but it's
[37:25] satan
[37:27] i wrote myself a note look it's so close
[37:29] because i was thinking about this the
[37:31] other day
[37:32] you watch that spirit you watch what
[37:35] though the antichrist spirit
[37:37] called the real spirit when jesus was on
[37:39] earth
[37:42] when jesus was on earth
[37:45] let's take it to the end time but let's
[37:47] go back and see what when jesus when the
[37:49] son of man was on earth
[37:52] doing the things he did they called him
[37:55] a devil
[37:57] they didn't call him just the devil they
[37:58] called him the head of the demons
[38:02] they called him beelzebub
[38:06] the very word of god see what i'm saying
[38:11] the very word of god they said belgium
[38:13] called him a wine bible said oh he
[38:15] he hangs around sinners and he's he's
[38:18] this
[38:18] and he's that he's not he can't be the
[38:21] son of god
[38:23] yet he fulfilled all of the old
[38:25] testament
[38:27] he walked up one day and he said
[38:30] what part did i not fulfill
[38:34] what part am i not go read your bible
[38:37] you religious people
[38:40] he said by your traditions
[38:43] denominational ideas you have made the
[38:46] word of god of none effect
[38:48] to the people and there stood the word
[38:52] they called him bielge above they said
[38:55] you are just
[38:55] joseph's boy you're illegitimate
[39:00] but he was the word of god he fooled
[39:04] he fulfilled the word of god to the
[39:05] letter he wasn't off one word
[39:08] and the religious groups come on
[39:10] somebody the religious
[39:12] groups of that day called him a devil
[39:16] why because he was out of the normal
[39:19] yeah
[39:19] that's right he was out of the normal
[39:23] denominational idea
[39:25] when they had a nice seeing council
[39:27] which they had a real one in
[39:28] in 606 and 325 but they had a couple of
[39:31] nice seeing councils when jesus was
[39:33] there and he walked up and
[39:35] he said unless you believe i am he
[39:38] you'll die in your sins
[39:40] and i just throw them over a loop i said
[39:42] what do you mean
[39:44] you're bialzebum jesus just looked at
[39:47] him and said
[39:48] how can satan cast out satan
[39:51] how can the devil how can a the man of
[39:55] the house in other words
[39:57] the strong man of the house come on
[40:00] throw the strong man of the house out
[40:02] how you throw a strong man he's talking
[40:03] about god he's somebody himself really
[40:05] how can you throw the strong man out
[40:07] he's the strong man of the house
[40:10] see what i'm saying though you take that
[40:11] and bring it right here today because
[40:13] the antichrist spirit is going to call
[40:15] the real spirit of god
[40:18] antichrist because that's what they were
[40:21] saying they were saying you're
[40:22] anti-christ
[40:25] but he was the christ that's right you
[40:27] and i are the christ by the baptism of
[40:29] the holy ghost
[40:31] and the world thinks we're crazy
[40:35] we're not normal we're not
[40:39] meeting on saturday we're not baptizing
[40:43] the way the rest of the world you know
[40:44] the whole world baptizes one way
[40:46] except for just a few groups of people
[40:52] jesus said unless you believe that i am
[40:54] he yes you'll die in your sin
[40:57] and they died in their sins and nice all
[41:00] the different high priests
[41:02] they live the word to the letter
[41:06] what their denomination required they
[41:09] lived it
[41:12] but when the one that came that was the
[41:14] truth
[41:16] they called him a denomination they
[41:18] called him bill's above they caught they
[41:20] said we don't want anything to do with
[41:22] you
[41:24] think about it today
[41:29] we're living in this world but remember
[41:31] we're not of the world
[41:33] when when the old saying is when the
[41:34] screws start tightening
[41:36] just a little bit more it's going to
[41:38] start separating folks
[41:41] because we're we're already now in in
[41:44] part of the of the world now where you
[41:46] can't move you can't do things
[41:48] there's already um rumblings going on
[41:52] that
[41:52] that even brother louise were telling me
[41:54] that he's gonna try to go maybe
[41:57] to nicaragua into different places do
[41:58] you know you're gonna have to have a
[42:00] vaccination card before you leave
[42:03] hmm and a vaccination card to get back
[42:08] in
[42:09] so you got to take their vaccine before
[42:11] you can go anywhere
[42:16] maybe before you can move around right
[42:19] maybe before you can get in walmart you
[42:21] got to go
[42:22] scan your card right that you've took
[42:25] that
[42:26] silly vaccine they're trying to give
[42:27] people
[42:29] be careful about that take it if you
[42:31] want to but i'm telling you
[42:34] i wouldn't take it from my life
[42:37] because right now there are already side
[42:38] effects they're even seeing now so i
[42:40] wouldn't take that thing for nothing in
[42:42] the world
[42:43] i'm going to take the gospel and i'm
[42:45] going to believe it
[42:47] that's okay listen there's listen we've
[42:50] had vaccines for
[42:51] measles rubella those were and jonah's
[42:55] salt brother branham said jonah salt god
[42:56] gave him the
[42:58] not the idea but gave him the ability to
[43:00] come up with that polio vaccine
[43:02] amen i believe that but this crazy thing
[43:05] is coming this
[43:05] here now i don't believe nothing they've
[43:08] run it through too quick
[43:10] listen there's something behind all this
[43:11] and you know that as well as i do
[43:13] but let's get on to this this is so
[43:15] close though
[43:16] what you and i were sitting in a church
[43:18] today and we're all comfortable
[43:21] but wait until we are asked the
[43:23] questions
[43:24] of what is your religion what is your
[43:28] normal well
[43:31] well we don't believe the bible even
[43:34] tells us to be baptized in the name
[43:35] father son holy ghost
[43:37] jesus said in the name of the father and
[43:40] of the son of the holy ghost which is
[43:42] the lord jesus christ
[43:43] and we know that but the world doesn't
[43:46] the world
[43:47] will fight you over that one thing
[43:50] no eternal hell do you believe eternal
[43:52] hell no we do not believe in eternal
[43:54] hell we believe in eternal judgment
[43:56] but we do not believe in an eternal
[43:58] burning hell because the bible does not
[43:59] tell you there's a burning eternal hell
[44:01] all right
[44:02] because you'd have to have eternal life
[44:03] to go to hell and you can't do that
[44:06] all right you can't do that because to
[44:08] me hell will be
[44:09] void of eternal life that's why it's
[44:11] going to be a living hell
[44:12] because it'll be void of of christ it'll
[44:15] be void of god
[44:16] right but the world's going to nail us
[44:19] down
[44:20] just like they did jesus and they hung
[44:23] him on a cross
[44:25] because he wasn't of their normal right
[44:27] he was not of their denomination
[44:31] he wasn't even close to their
[44:32] denomination
[44:34] and you know what he stood up one day
[44:36] and he told him about it too
[44:38] and that's what got paul killed that's
[44:40] what got peter killed and that's what
[44:41] got a lot of people killed
[44:43] is because why it's that same spirit
[44:45] that cain killed abel
[44:47] same spirit that got on cane
[44:51] because abel's denominator
[44:54] doctrine was right and cain's
[44:56] denomination that he had set up was
[44:58] wrong
[45:01] so you see what we're heading toward but
[45:03] thank god
[45:04] revelations 3 says we have a faithful
[45:06] and true witness
[45:08] the beginning of the creation of god is
[45:10] brother dale's been speaking now
[45:11] remember
[45:12] you and i are the continuation of that
[45:13] because looking you keep reading this
[45:15] quote it said it exposes satan we were
[45:17] talking about that last sunday
[45:18] it exposes satan
[45:22] because what are we doing everything's
[45:24] good you know we're okay we're walking
[45:26] through the world but all of a sudden
[45:31] they're gonna start like i said before
[45:33] something's gonna come about
[45:34] where you're gonna have to make a choice
[45:38] of whether you stay with the normal
[45:41] or will you get put over here in this
[45:43] group but what are you doing you're not
[45:45] what did jesus christ do when he came on
[45:48] earth he came and exposed
[45:50] satan that's why they hated him because
[45:53] you put satan
[45:55] inside of a human oh yeah
[46:00] that's worse than anything but now
[46:03] murderers and all those different things
[46:05] that's bad
[46:06] but you take a religious demon and put
[46:09] him in a man
[46:10] that's worse that's worse
[46:14] because he'll deceive you see a murderer
[46:17] comes in here and acts murderer or
[46:19] somebody a drug dealer
[46:20] that's not going to deceive me i know
[46:22] what's in that man
[46:24] but when a religious man walks in and
[46:26] he's so close until it's right at the
[46:28] very end there's got to be a separation
[46:30] time
[46:32] but it all started as a spirit of
[46:34] antichrist
[46:35] yes but it's heading up into what
[46:40] if it heads up into god in human flesh
[46:42] it's going to head up in satan in the
[46:43] human flesh
[46:45] amen all right so let's finish this
[46:47] quote it exposes satan revealing his
[46:49] works attempted destruction of god's
[46:50] people
[46:52] and the discrediting of god's word right
[46:54] down to the time he is cast into the
[46:56] lake of fire he fights that he cannot
[46:58] stand it
[46:59] he knows that if the people get the true
[47:00] revelation of the true church and what
[47:02] she is
[47:03] and what she stands for that she can do
[47:05] the greater work she will be an
[47:06] invincible army
[47:07] if they get a true revelation now look
[47:09] how many times he used the word
[47:11] true if they get a true revelation of
[47:13] the two spirits within the framework of
[47:15] the
[47:15] christian church and by god's spirit
[47:18] discerning withstand the antichrist
[47:19] spirit satan will be what
[47:21] powerless before her
[47:24] let's go to revelations 3 and to the
[47:26] angel the church of laodicea
[47:28] which is this age these things saith the
[47:30] amen the faithful and true witness
[47:33] the beginning of the creation of god now
[47:36] remember that word true was
[47:38] not as in it was false at one time
[47:41] but what happened is god's always been
[47:43] true
[47:45] that's a given who's brought the faults
[47:47] in
[47:48] man man and satan through man has added
[47:51] a little bit
[47:52] to make it an untrue witness that which
[47:55] has not only the name and resemblance
[47:57] but the real nature corresponding to the
[47:59] name
[48:00] in every respect corresponding to the
[48:02] idea signified by the name
[48:04] real true and genuine in other words
[48:08] all the trash is going to be done away
[48:10] in the end time
[48:12] there's not going to be a church that
[48:14] sits and says okay we believe in this
[48:16] and it not be of the bible
[48:19] i'm talking about truth true church
[48:21] we're talking about true church
[48:23] all right you say all that never can
[48:25] happen no yeah it can
[48:28] that's why i'm telling you the son of
[48:30] man revelation
[48:31] is back to where jesus was standing on
[48:33] the earth two thousand years ago
[48:36] and what he said that's what you and i
[48:38] are gonna have to say
[48:40] and he can't deviate that's why peter
[48:44] didn't stand up on the day of pentecost
[48:45] and
[48:46] say repent everybody and be baptized in
[48:48] the name of the father and of the son
[48:49] another holy ghost
[48:50] that's not what jesus said by revelation
[48:54] yes peter caught the revelation and said
[48:57] you've got to be baptized by the name of
[49:00] somebody
[49:02] so it's the name of jesus christ
[49:05] for the remission he sins and you shall
[49:07] receive the gift of the holy ghost what
[49:08] a gift
[49:10] let's read number two god's provided
[49:12] place of worship
[49:13] so now at the end time we see the things
[49:15] happening the way they are there's a
[49:17] great warning amongst the elected people
[49:18] of god
[49:19] to find what is right and it behooves us
[49:23] to know that
[49:24] now not somebody's theory but to know
[49:28] what is truth
[49:29] what the bible says is the truth because
[49:31] it'll be too late one of these days for
[49:33] us
[49:34] and this may be the day so let's take
[49:36] real consideration
[49:37] of what god has said let's go to john 17
[49:40] verse 16.
[49:41] jesus is praying he says they are not of
[49:44] this world even as i am not of the world
[49:47] sanctify them through thy truth thy word
[49:49] is true so the only way we're going to
[49:50] get sanctified is through the truth
[49:52] the true word of god as thou has sent
[49:55] men to the world even so have i sent
[49:57] them into the world so whatever
[49:58] jesus christ was equipped with come on
[50:01] somebody
[50:02] whatever jesus christ was equipped with
[50:04] he's sending us in the same
[50:06] in the world with the same equipment
[50:08] right
[50:09] or it's not true right here and for
[50:13] their sake i sanctify myself
[50:15] that they also may be sanctified through
[50:19] the truth glory
[50:24] the spirit of truth the spirit of error
[50:26] all right now let's go to what is truth
[50:28] here's what i found in the internet
[50:30] there's 30 000 worldwide christian
[50:33] organizations
[50:34] 30 000 some of them have different gods
[50:40] but these are christian organizations
[50:43] these are
[50:44] organizations that believe of some form
[50:46] that jesus
[50:48] was the savior of the world this is not
[50:51] including all the radicals
[50:54] and there's 1200 in the united states
[50:56] alone
[50:58] 1200 different ways of looking at this
[51:00] bible
[51:05] let's read first john 4 verse 3 again
[51:07] this was part of the one that we read
[51:09] when we began
[51:11] and every spirit that confesses not that
[51:12] jesus christ has come in the flesh is
[51:14] not of god
[51:15] and this is that spirit of antichrist
[51:18] all right
[51:19] wherever you have heard that it should
[51:21] come and even now already is in the
[51:24] world
[51:24] as a baby listen the only communication
[51:28] you had back in the first
[51:29] probably four church ages which was the
[51:32] first thousand years of existence after
[51:34] jesus
[51:35] left the earth was what it was not
[51:39] in book form the bible only came
[51:42] being there you know about what fifteen
[51:44] hundred sixteen hundreds
[51:47] so a thousand years twelve hundred
[51:49] fifteen 1500 years
[51:50] it was word of mouth oh yeah you had
[51:53] people would scribe things and write it
[51:55] down
[51:55] but i mean if if um irenaeus came out
[51:58] and preached the sermon it wasn't
[52:00] recorded
[52:02] so the people had to take what he said
[52:05] right right and run it through their
[52:08] filter to see if it was right or not
[52:09] they didn't have a
[52:10] look at me and you we've got all this
[52:12] information we've got all this we can go
[52:15] back in the internet and we can go back
[52:16] into this and look at all this
[52:18] information
[52:19] to see if it's true or not but what they
[52:22] had was is they
[52:23] compared it with what what was already
[52:25] inside of them
[52:26] they didn't have a quote book to go back
[52:28] to
[52:29] amen even paul's writings and all were
[52:32] lost for periods of time
[52:35] so what they believe in they run it
[52:39] through their holy ghost filter and
[52:40] something inside of them that they had
[52:42] to depend on
[52:44] said that ain't nothing but the truth or
[52:45] that ain't nothing but the error
[52:47] amen what are you saying brother
[52:50] sometimes we because paul even comes up
[52:53] and he says the letter will kill you
[52:56] the letter will kill you
[52:59] but the spirit on the letter is what
[53:02] gives you life
[53:03] amen so let's look right here
[53:07] pull these next ones up
[53:10] because the way this thing started out
[53:12] we know one thing's for sure
[53:15] was a saying went out oh yeah
[53:18] you know there was a saying that jesus
[53:20] was almighty god and then there was a
[53:22] saying that he was bells above
[53:24] amen there was a saying that went out
[53:27] that said
[53:30] what did philip say thou art
[53:33] the christ thou art the king of israel
[53:37] that he he without the holy ghost
[53:41] philip hadn't had the holy ghost yet or
[53:43] the one that said that nathanael
[53:44] whichever one said that
[53:46] he didn't have the holy ghost he
[53:47] responded by what he saw
[53:51] come see a man the lady said
[53:55] at the pool she said come see a man. but
[53:58] now remember what she said she said
[54:00] we know see they had old testament to
[54:03] read
[54:04] but they didn't have a new testament but
[54:07] she even by revelation
[54:10] saw that he was fulfilling the old
[54:13] testament that's why i said before
[54:15] let me bring this out again all the
[54:17] religious
[54:18] organizations in jesus time called him a
[54:20] devil
[54:22] but every time jesus walked up listen
[54:25] listen when he approached legion which
[54:28] had many
[54:29] demons what did the demons say
[54:33] to jesus thou art the son of god why
[54:37] have you come to what
[54:39] torment us before our time i think
[54:42] that's twice in the gospels jesus would
[54:44] go and
[54:45] talk to somebody with a demon and the
[54:47] demon would talk back and say we know
[54:49] who you are
[54:51] the devils knew he was jesus christ he
[54:53] was almighty god and the religious
[54:55] people
[54:55] thought he was the devil yeah yeah look
[54:58] how backwards it is that's the same
[55:00] thing i'm gonna do to me in you
[55:02] they're gonna say you're not normal
[55:04] that's right you don't accept normal
[55:07] practices
[55:12] that's all right paul said by the way of
[55:14] call heresy i do
[55:16] i serve god you know what they thought
[55:18] paul was crazy
[55:20] but he wrote 80 of the new testament
[55:22] that's to me that's
[55:24] that's okay i'll be crazy like that
[55:28] but it became a saying because people
[55:30] would
[55:31] boy didn't you hear that sermon by
[55:33] brother so-and-so this morning said
[55:36] i think he meant this oh buddy
[55:40] when you come up and say i think right
[55:43] you're in trouble i think i thought
[55:48] that's what the saying was sirenthis
[55:51] probably got him a little congregation
[55:53] and said oh this great here's this great
[55:55] revelation jesus could not be almighty
[55:56] god
[55:58] because he cried he died all these
[56:00] things
[56:02] but now we know he was a good man we
[56:04] know he was a prophet because he would
[56:06] foretell things and all
[56:07] so so so maybe i think maybe then you've
[56:10] got
[56:11] god up here and you got jesus down here
[56:13] and he talked of coming back as a spirit
[56:15] so there's one two
[56:16] three see how simple that looks though
[56:21] who reads the bible and i was reading it
[56:23] the other day in corinthians
[56:25] or ephesians where jesus said the god of
[56:28] our the god and father of our lord jesus
[56:30] christ bless you all well boy the
[56:31] trinitarians are like wow look at that
[56:33] why there's three or four of them
[56:35] standing around up there
[56:36] when no way in paul's teaching
[56:40] was he thinking of that
[56:43] amen it was not trinitarian
[56:47] the first original church had no
[56:49] doctrine except the truth
[56:51] the original first church that's why
[56:53] we're going to read here in a minute
[56:54] where malachi 4
[56:57] had to come back to restore that there
[56:59] had to be a
[57:00] spirit of elijah come to restore
[57:03] us back to when there was no 1200
[57:06] different ways of looking at the bible
[57:08] where there was no 30 000 different ways
[57:10] of looking at the bible amen
[57:16] a saying
[57:19] and what is a deed a deed is something
[57:21] that you do
[57:22] so they started doing it they started
[57:25] preaching
[57:26] and teaching all these different things
[57:30] then we come up to 325 and i see a rome
[57:34] and we see that it solidified a little
[57:38] more the doctrine
[57:40] because i read you the quote before
[57:41] where 1500 people went
[57:44] so many of them were true believers a
[57:47] lot of them were not true believers
[57:50] they wanted what they had constantine
[57:52] sitting there
[57:54] everybody thought constantine was this
[57:55] great christian man because he put
[57:57] crosses on the backs of the
[57:59] of the soldiers and told them to go out
[58:00] but you know what they were doing when
[58:02] they got there
[58:03] they were persecuting the real
[58:06] christians
[58:07] the people that didn't believe because
[58:09] you know what they did they held that
[58:10] sword and they said
[58:11] you believe in the holy roman catholic
[58:13] church and they said
[58:15] antichrist
[58:18] amen 68 million people
[58:22] 68 million christians were killed during
[58:24] the dark ages
[58:26] not during during this time right here
[58:28] not during this time
[58:31] there were just little sayings little
[58:32] deeds but boy when it become a doctrine
[58:35] when they put their seal on it and said
[58:37] this is it
[58:39] you believe it this way
[58:42] or you die that's right amen
[58:47] and then what's going to happen with
[58:48] that it continued on folks
[58:51] not just now it's a doctrine all over
[58:53] the world thirty thousand different in
[58:55] twelve hundred in the united states
[58:57] it's coming into the head of an
[58:58] incarnate antichrist
[59:00] or the bible calls him the beast
[59:03] that rises up in the end time and speaks
[59:06] like god
[59:08] sitting in the temple of god showing
[59:09] himself that he is god not that he wants
[59:11] to be god
[59:12] he's showing himself that he is god so
[59:15] this thing has went from a baby form
[59:17] a spirit of antichrist to incarnate
[59:20] antichrist
[59:21] right same way with you we go through
[59:24] what justification
[59:26] what you don't you just understand one
[59:29] thing
[59:31] jesus christ just forgave you your sins
[59:34] that's all you know
[59:37] because what's justification
[59:39] justification is chopping off your past
[59:41] sin
[59:42] you turn and go that way
[59:45] amen so there you living under state now
[59:48] what's deeds
[59:49] sanctification what is these i quit
[59:51] smoking i quit drinking i quit doing
[59:53] drugs i quit doing
[59:54] that's not saying you got god in your
[59:56] soul
[59:58] that's just god cleaning you up
[59:59] according to the book of luke
[1:00:01] the unclean spirit goes out of a man
[1:00:05] you're you're doing works you're doing
[1:00:07] deeds
[1:00:09] right but you're not filled with the
[1:00:11] holy ghost yet and they did not
[1:00:13] pin this during this part this is where
[1:00:16] it was what
[1:00:18] sealed right where are you sealed you're
[1:00:21] not sealed right here right here
[1:00:22] you're sealed right here you're sealed
[1:00:25] by the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:00:27] they sealed their doctrine at nicea they
[1:00:29] said this is it and you can't change it
[1:00:32] right then look me and you as we grow up
[1:00:35] the statue of a perfect man
[1:00:37] listen we're in baby form right here
[1:00:41] this is not baby form this is our time
[1:00:44] this is adoption time where it's not you
[1:00:48] speaking it's god speaking through you
[1:00:51] and there's not an argument
[1:00:55] you know that was a whole deal when
[1:00:56] jesus was on earth he never argued
[1:00:59] with the spirit that was inside of him
[1:01:02] because they were the same
[1:01:04] he said okay we can't be that way why
[1:01:05] can't we be that way
[1:01:08] why can't we by the spirit of adoption
[1:01:10] and all these different things that the
[1:01:12] spirit
[1:01:13] that lives in you that was in jesus
[1:01:15] dwelt in you you've got to believe
[1:01:18] and and and try our best listen we all
[1:01:21] have come from sin
[1:01:24] but we can live so close to jesus christ
[1:01:27] if we'll let him
[1:01:29] let him take over brother dale said let
[1:01:32] him in that spirit realm
[1:01:35] let him in that memories and conscious
[1:01:37] effects and imagination because you know
[1:01:38] what paul tells us
[1:01:39] paul tells us now we've come up to a
[1:01:41] place where we have the mind of christ
[1:01:43] now did not adam have the mind of christ
[1:01:45] adam had the mind of christ so much so
[1:01:47] he named all the animals and
[1:01:48] god never had to reverse the process
[1:01:51] jesus walked on earth and he never i
[1:01:53] read your quote the other day where
[1:01:54] brother brown said jesus never had to
[1:01:56] back anything
[1:01:57] back off of what he said nothing
[1:02:01] now you and i do it every day every few
[1:02:03] minutes for some of us
[1:02:06] we have to go no i didn't really mean
[1:02:07] that but jesus never
[1:02:09] walked up one day and said look i've
[1:02:11] been telling y'all for a year
[1:02:12] but i really didn't mean what i said no
[1:02:16] he said what he meant and he meant what
[1:02:17] he said why because he didn't
[1:02:19] it wasn't a war between him and the
[1:02:21] spirit that was inside of him you and i
[1:02:23] have a war between us
[1:02:25] but when we become incarnate god as i
[1:02:28] said before
[1:02:29] when death walks up our sleeve and i was
[1:02:32] talking to him
[1:02:33] talking to a baptist girl cuts her hair
[1:02:36] she said what do you think about this
[1:02:38] she asked a lot of questions
[1:02:40] i said look i i she's talking about
[1:02:42] dying
[1:02:44] she said has everybody got to die i said
[1:02:45] no jenny read the bible
[1:02:47] i said her name sorry read the bible
[1:02:51] paul says we which are alive and remain
[1:02:55] to the coming of the lord shall not
[1:02:57] prevent or hinder
[1:02:59] those which are fiction to be
[1:03:00] resurrected
[1:03:02] i said that's bible if you believe one
[1:03:05] you got to believe the rest of it
[1:03:07] i said so we have got to be some we that
[1:03:10] don't die
[1:03:11] that's right
[1:03:16] amen and you can't die with a
[1:03:18] denominational idea because that's
[1:03:19] what's killing us
[1:03:21] our ideas is what's killing us
[1:03:24] amen
[1:03:28] saying deed doctrine incarnate
[1:03:30] antichrist
[1:03:31] justification sanctification baptism in
[1:03:33] the holy ghost makes incarnate god back
[1:03:35] on the earth
[1:03:37] just like it was 2 000 years ago
[1:03:40] whoa that's too much no paul said i pray
[1:03:44] i'm reading bible here i pray that your
[1:03:47] whole body
[1:03:49] spirit and soul
[1:03:53] in other words be preserved or perfected
[1:03:56] until the end your whole body
[1:04:01] spirit and soul he didn't leave anything
[1:04:03] out
[1:04:05] because you know what paul couldn't see
[1:04:07] it like we see it but he saw enough to
[1:04:09] know
[1:04:10] that there was coming a bride in the end
[1:04:12] time that was not going to fall for all
[1:04:14] these denominational ideas it's not
[1:04:16] going to fall for all these untruths
[1:04:18] that we've been all brought up with yes
[1:04:23] just like the four horse riders the four
[1:04:25] horse riders we were talking about the
[1:04:27] other day
[1:04:27] it's four it's not horses it's powers
[1:04:30] in the bible a horse is a power a beast
[1:04:33] is a power it's something that you use
[1:04:35] to get somewhere
[1:04:37] well as satan uses four
[1:04:40] which is what white right red
[1:04:44] black and pale god uses
[1:04:49] four combat beasts to combat these four
[1:04:52] horse riders
[1:04:53] or four horses now same rider but it's
[1:04:55] four horses four different powers
[1:04:57] he uses the lion the ox of man and the
[1:04:59] eagle
[1:05:00] the anointing of the holy ghost in the
[1:05:02] ages to combat that
[1:05:04] that was riding out even in the small
[1:05:07] but look
[1:05:08] satan's smart folks he didn't start out
[1:05:10] riding a red horse
[1:05:12] he didn't start out riding the black
[1:05:14] horse he didn't start out riding the
[1:05:16] pale horse that said death
[1:05:18] he started out as a white church he
[1:05:21] started out as a little white
[1:05:23] oh beautiful but there was one part of
[1:05:27] him
[1:05:29] it was black because he was deaf to
[1:05:32] begin with
[1:05:33] but he was hiding he was hiding under
[1:05:36] the
[1:05:36] the guise of a white righteous church
[1:05:42] sayings deeds
[1:05:45] doctrines right incarnate it has to
[1:05:48] start with
[1:05:48] listen you've either got to start with
[1:05:50] the spirit of antichrist or the spirit
[1:05:52] of christ
[1:05:53] there's no other spirit anywhere else
[1:05:55] that's what i'm trying to get to you now
[1:05:56] we know we all
[1:05:58] we all begin humanly as anti
[1:06:03] we all came anti-words the word says
[1:06:05] we're supposed to come like genesis 1 26
[1:06:07] like brother dale's been preaching we're
[1:06:08] supposed to come by the spoken word of
[1:06:10] god
[1:06:12] right but we came the other way yes but
[1:06:15] you know what he's working right back to
[1:06:17] the spoken word
[1:06:18] of god because when you get the baptism
[1:06:20] of the holy ghost you get born
[1:06:22] again you get birthed like you had
[1:06:25] supposed to been birthed had there not
[1:06:26] been a fall
[1:06:30] you go right back to the spoken word of
[1:06:31] god
[1:06:34] let's read second thessalonians
[1:06:37] verse two everybody all right say amen
[1:06:39] amen all right second thessalonians
[1:06:43] let no man deceive you by any means now
[1:06:45] hold on there this is paul
[1:06:48] in thessalonica which is a city
[1:06:52] thinking greek yeah it's in greek in
[1:06:55] greece
[1:06:58] let no man deceive you by any means for
[1:07:01] that day shall not come except there
[1:07:03] come a falling away first
[1:07:05] so this is going to happen all right
[1:07:09] and that not baby
[1:07:13] not spirit but that man
[1:07:18] it has now grown into a man
[1:07:21] that man of sin be revealed
[1:07:24] the son of perdition who opposes and
[1:07:27] exalted himself oh by the way we see
[1:07:29] that that's them
[1:07:30] that's them satanists out there that
[1:07:32] sacrifice
[1:07:33] him uh remember go
[1:07:37] back to matthew so close
[1:07:40] until it would receive the very last so
[1:07:42] don't throw it out there
[1:07:45] who opposes and exalteth himself
[1:07:49] above all that is called god or that is
[1:07:52] worshipped
[1:07:53] so that he as god not like god
[1:07:57] he wants to be like god but right here
[1:07:59] somebody has put him in a place
[1:08:01] of exaltation they have exalted him so
[1:08:05] he
[1:08:06] that he as god sitteth in the temple of
[1:08:09] god
[1:08:10] showing himself that he is god
[1:08:15] remember you not that when i was yet
[1:08:17] with you i told you these things that's
[1:08:19] been 2 000 years ago
[1:08:21] and now you know what withholdeth that
[1:08:24] he might be revealed in his time
[1:08:26] because remember the mystery of iniquity
[1:08:28] was a spirit back in the first
[1:08:30] two three church ages but it's going to
[1:08:32] head up into a beast
[1:08:35] in our time not their time our time
[1:08:39] for the mystery of iniquity doth already
[1:08:42] work
[1:08:42] all right it's working it's a spirit
[1:08:44] only he who now letteth will let who god
[1:08:47] god's gonna let this thing go seven
[1:08:48] church ages
[1:08:49] until he the bride be taken out of the
[1:08:51] way and then shall that
[1:08:53] wicked be revealed whom the lord shall
[1:08:56] consume with the spirit of his mouth
[1:08:58] and shall destroy with the brightness of
[1:09:00] his coming
[1:09:02] even him whose coming is after the
[1:09:04] working of satan with all power see he's
[1:09:05] going to have
[1:09:06] power signs and wonders the bible says
[1:09:09] the wound the deadly wound he's die he
[1:09:11] dies and he resurrects and all these
[1:09:13] things he's
[1:09:14] he's got the power of the whole world
[1:09:17] what a great setup now to have a guy
[1:09:20] walk out
[1:09:22] and say if you'll come to me i'll get
[1:09:25] rid of this virus for you
[1:09:28] because i'm the head religious guy of
[1:09:30] the world
[1:09:31] okay don't hear much of that right now
[1:09:34] but
[1:09:34] don't worry even him who's coming is
[1:09:37] after the working of satan do you know
[1:09:39] right now
[1:09:41] you know the prophet of god told us 50
[1:09:43] or 60 years ago
[1:09:45] that the catholic church will pay us out
[1:09:46] of debt
[1:09:48] amen and do you know right now we owe 21
[1:09:53] trillion dollars every person in the
[1:09:57] united states of america
[1:09:59] owes 70 000
[1:10:02] a piece out of 360 million people we owe
[1:10:07] 70 000 apiece we're all in debt
[1:10:12] 21 trillion dollars were in debt
[1:10:16] somebody's going to pay that off and
[1:10:18] when they pay
[1:10:19] listen when you pay somebody off like
[1:10:21] that what are you going to do if i come
[1:10:22] home and
[1:10:23] and poor brothers that's got kind of
[1:10:25] cockeyed one day and bought a
[1:10:27] 500 000 home with a 50 a week
[1:10:31] paycheck every how that might happen
[1:10:34] and he's so stressed with debt and all
[1:10:36] that stuff and i walk in and say what's
[1:10:38] that buddy
[1:10:39] wow i got i just had this weak moment
[1:10:42] i owe 400 000 i said hips here he
[1:10:46] pay it off whether he knows it or not
[1:10:51] as a christian as a christian there's no
[1:10:53] strings attached
[1:10:55] but as a non-christian as the devil
[1:10:58] incarnate
[1:10:59] there are strings attached i'm going to
[1:11:02] own this boy
[1:11:04] man for the rest of his life right
[1:11:08] so that's the way it's going to be we're
[1:11:09] going to oh we're not sure they're going
[1:11:11] to pay our debt off but we're going to
[1:11:12] owe
[1:11:13] more than that money to whoever pays our
[1:11:16] debt off
[1:11:17] thank god see we see these things we've
[1:11:19] already read the newspaper
[1:11:22] as brother dale said the prophecy went
[1:11:24] back in 1930 something
[1:11:26] that there would be a woman in the white
[1:11:27] house now nobody's believed that much
[1:11:29] nobody believed all these other things
[1:11:31] but they all came to pass
[1:11:33] so there must got to be some truth
[1:11:34] somewhere
[1:11:37] and even him whose coming is after the
[1:11:39] working of satan with all power
[1:11:41] and signs and lying wonders and with all
[1:11:44] the deceivableness of unrighteousness
[1:11:47] in them that perish look because it
[1:11:50] wasn't because they didn't
[1:11:52] receive the truth they didn't receive
[1:11:55] the love
[1:11:56] of the truth that they might be saved
[1:12:00] and for this cause god shall send them
[1:12:02] strong
[1:12:03] delusion glory what strong what is
[1:12:06] strong delusion strong delusion is
[1:12:08] 30 000 worldwide christian organizations
[1:12:12] 1200 in the united states alone
[1:12:14] different
[1:12:15] ways of seeing the bible
[1:12:20] god can't be that confused
[1:12:25] he didn't stand up and say i'm one of
[1:12:27] the ways
[1:12:29] i'm one of the truths no he said i am
[1:12:32] the way
[1:12:33] i am the truth i am the life
[1:12:36] and i'm going to come back inside of you
[1:12:39] and make you the truth

[1:12:44] we're looking for something folks and we
[1:12:45] already got it looking for some great
[1:12:51] something some bug to fall on us one day

[1:13:33] a strong delusion look
[1:13:34] that they should believe a lie
[1:13:38] believe
[1:13:41] a lie yes now i'm reading bible
[1:13:44] it's not hearsay this is paul say
[1:13:49] they shall believe a lie they receive
[1:13:52] not the
[1:13:53] love of the truth that they might be
[1:13:55] saved
[1:13:57] i don't read that but look for this
[1:13:59] cause
[1:14:00] god will send them strong delusion
[1:14:05] that they'll just believe listen
[1:14:08] go talk to people you talk to real true
[1:14:11] believe that believe their religion
[1:14:13] they'll just about kill

[1:14:22] throne
[1:14:22] well lady sorry or man sorry that's
[1:14:26] that ain't bible
[1:14:30] so you just leave it alone right but
[1:14:33] look right here
[1:14:35] matthew 7 verse 21 i want you to read
[1:14:37] this right here
[1:14:41] because we've got 1200 different ways
[1:14:42] that the of of religious organizations
[1:14:44] in the united states now all 120
[1:14:46] different ways
[1:14:46] not every one that sayeth unto me lord
[1:14:49] lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[1:14:50] heaven
[1:14:52] but he that doeth the will of my father
[1:14:54] which is in heaven
[1:14:56] many will say to me in that day what day
[1:14:59] the day that's coming up lord lord
[1:15:04] have we not prophesied in thy name
[1:15:07] and in thy name have cast out devils
[1:15:11] remember satan can't cast out satan so
[1:15:13] it had to be god doing the work
[1:15:15] they were so anointed but they were
[1:15:17] anointed on their spirit realm they were
[1:15:19] not anointed on this
[1:15:20] in their soul because look
[1:15:24] and in thy name cast out devils and in
[1:15:26] thy name done many
[1:15:27] wonderful works
[1:15:31] right and then will i profess unto them
[1:15:36] i never knew you
[1:15:40] and that word new is the same as a
[1:15:42] relationship between husband and wife
[1:15:44] that's not just
[1:15:45] i know no we never had a personal
[1:15:48] intimate relationship those people never
[1:15:50] had a personal
[1:15:51] intimate relationship with jesus christ
[1:15:53] depart i never knew you depart from me
[1:15:56] you that work iniquity what was talking
[1:15:58] about the mystery of iniquity was
[1:15:59] starting in the first church age
[1:16:03] you know what iniquity is it's reading
[1:16:04] the bible that you're supposed to be
[1:16:05] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[1:16:07] christ and you don't
[1:16:08] that's right that's iniquity that's what
[1:16:11] these 1200 major denominations in the
[1:16:13] united states that's what they're doing
[1:16:14] now
[1:16:17] you say you're talking about me no i'm
[1:16:18] talking about spirit remember not people
[1:16:20] we're talking about spirits
[1:16:23] i would say the pope is a good guy but
[1:16:25] one of these days according to the bible
[1:16:27] there's going to be a man of sin
[1:16:29] there's going to be a head guy a beast
[1:16:32] that's going to what
[1:16:34] rule the world
[1:16:37] that's right but he's going to take him
[1:16:40] to what
[1:16:41] a literal destruction amen
[1:16:46] let's read first john 2 verse 8.
[1:16:53] now we're still in the little john's
[1:16:54] remember we've been reading first john 4
[1:16:56] this is first john 2.
[1:16:58] watch john now remember john's been on
[1:17:00] the alabamas he's seen the antichrist
[1:17:01] he's seen this
[1:17:02] beautiful church he's seen what's going
[1:17:04] on he's come back and he's telling us
[1:17:06] little children
[1:17:07] it is the last time and as ye have heard
[1:17:10] that antichrist shall come
[1:17:12] even now are there many antichrists
[1:17:16] whereby we know that it is the last time
[1:17:20] they went out from us but they were not
[1:17:23] of us
[1:17:24] for if they had been of us they would no
[1:17:27] doubt have continued with us
[1:17:31] but they went out that they might be
[1:17:32] made manifest that they were not
[1:17:34] all of us but ye have an
[1:17:37] unction from the holy one and you know
[1:17:40] all things i have not written unto you
[1:17:44] because you know not the truth
[1:17:48] because you know it and that no lie is
[1:17:50] of the truth
[1:17:51] who is a liar but he that denies that
[1:17:54] jesus is the christ
[1:17:56] he is antichrist that denied the father
[1:17:58] and the son boy trinitarians are going
[1:18:00] like this
[1:18:02] whosoever denied the son the same hath
[1:18:04] not the father
[1:18:05] but see we know and we know that it's
[1:18:07] the same person so it doesn't bother us
[1:18:10] it's not it's not two separate people
[1:18:12] it's the same person
[1:18:13] amen but he that acknowledges the son
[1:18:15] hath the father also let that therefore
[1:18:17] abide in you
[1:18:19] which ye have heard from the beginning
[1:18:21] if that which you have heard from
[1:18:22] beginning shall remain in you
[1:18:25] you shall continue in the son and in the
[1:18:27] father and this is what the promise
[1:18:29] that he has promised us what even
[1:18:33] eternal life all right
[1:18:37] let's go to first corinthians 2.
[1:18:43] he said by the way why are you saying or
[1:18:45] why are you against i'm not against
[1:18:47] these denominations you understand that
[1:18:48] i'm not
[1:18:49] i'm against their teaching because their
[1:18:51] teaching is anti
[1:18:52] right their teaching is anti-words
[1:18:55] somebody has got to have the truth and
[1:18:57] somebody's got to have error
[1:18:58] right okay
[1:19:03] and you got to decide and i brethren
[1:19:07] when i came
[1:19:08] to you this is paul to the corinthians
[1:19:11] came not with excellency of speech or
[1:19:14] wisdom
[1:19:15] declaring unto you the testimony of god
[1:19:17] for i determine not to know anything
[1:19:20] among you save jesus christ and him
[1:19:22] crucified in other words i
[1:19:23] i don't want to hear all this other
[1:19:24] stuff you're talking about
[1:19:26] i i just know jesus christ now remember
[1:19:28] look
[1:19:29] paul was unique in that paul
[1:19:33] almost spoke to us as if he was right
[1:19:35] there with jesus the whole time jesus
[1:19:37] was on earth
[1:19:38] and he never saw him one time right not
[1:19:41] one time did he see jesus
[1:19:43] so what he had to take was the old
[1:19:45] testament by the holy ghost
[1:19:47] filter that he had and bring us into the
[1:19:50] new testament
[1:19:51] and show us jesus christ out of the old
[1:19:53] testament
[1:19:54] right and i was with you in weakness
[1:19:58] for i determined not to know anything
[1:20:00] among you saved jesus christ and him
[1:20:01] crucified and i was with you in weakness
[1:20:03] and in fear and in much trembling
[1:20:05] and my speech and my preaching was not
[1:20:07] with enticing words of
[1:20:09] man's wisdom i wished i could do that to
[1:20:12] keep most of y'all awake
[1:20:16] but in demonstration of the spirit of
[1:20:17] power that your faith look should not
[1:20:20] stand in the wisdom of man
[1:20:22] but in the power of god howbeit we speak
[1:20:26] wisdom among them that are perfect yet
[1:20:28] not the wisdom of this world
[1:20:31] nor of the princes of this world that
[1:20:33] come to naught
[1:20:35] watch this i like this but we speak the
[1:20:38] wisdom
[1:20:39] of god in a mystery
[1:20:44] now listen they asked jesus says
[1:20:48] why in the world are you speaking to us
[1:20:50] in parable
[1:20:53] and jesus answered them he said to hide
[1:20:56] it
[1:20:57] from the wise and prudent the people
[1:21:00] that think they know it all them 1200
[1:21:02] different ones and all the different
[1:21:04] ones that think they know it all
[1:21:07] i'm saying this to hide it from them
[1:21:10] but what did jesus say though but reveal
[1:21:12] it unto babes such as we'll learn
[1:21:16] amen but we speak the wisdom of god
[1:21:19] in a mystery even
[1:21:23] the hidden mis-wisdom which god ordained
[1:21:25] before the world
[1:21:26] unto our glory which none of the princes
[1:21:30] of this world knew
[1:21:34] kind of narrows it down a little bit
[1:21:35] doesn't it for had they known it
[1:21:38] they would not have crucified the lord
[1:21:39] of glory you know he's talking about
[1:21:41] the prince of the world he's talking
[1:21:42] about that organization that was on
[1:21:44] earth when jesus was there
[1:21:46] if they hadn't known who he was they'd
[1:21:47] have never crucified him
[1:21:49] they were standing there looking at
[1:21:51] their messiah
[1:21:53] that's how blind they were but you know
[1:21:54] what god let them believe a lie
[1:21:57] and be down by it
[1:22:00] so look i'm going to sum all this up
[1:22:04] right here
[1:22:05] we've come from a spirit of antichrist
[1:22:06] now we've come to a person we've come to
[1:22:08] the end time where there's 1200
[1:22:10] different denominations in america
[1:22:12] 30 000 across the world and we're
[1:22:14] looking at what we call the message of
[1:22:16] the hour
[1:22:18] which there's probably 1200 different
[1:22:20] ideas in it
[1:22:22] i'll say amen because i know they
[1:22:24] several
[1:22:25] so what is truth god had to send
[1:22:29] god had to do something
[1:22:32] he promised us
[1:22:35] that we would make it amen he promised
[1:22:39] us there'd be a bride
[1:22:40] he promised us there'd be someone that
[1:22:42] makes it he promised us
[1:22:44] on earth in saint john 17 he said lord
[1:22:48] sanctify them through thy truth that
[1:22:50] word is true they're in the world but
[1:22:51] they're
[1:22:52] not of the world they're like me
[1:22:56] and they're going to make it amen glory
[1:22:59] there's a group that's going to make it
[1:23:03] now all the other groups have died
[1:23:06] we're left but what are we going to do
[1:23:10] lord
[1:23:12] right at the end of the old testament
[1:23:13] this is what he tells us malachi 4
[1:23:16] verse 5 says behold i will send you
[1:23:19] elijah the prophet
[1:23:22] even send you
[1:23:26] elijah the prophet before the coming of
[1:23:28] the great and dreadful day of the lord
[1:23:30] you say oh wow that's got to be john the
[1:23:31] baptist no
[1:23:34] because it wasn't the great and dreadful
[1:23:35] day of the lord and it wasn't down here
[1:23:37] unless i smote the earth with a curse
[1:23:39] that's been 2 000 years ago
[1:23:40] and john told us who he was in the bible
[1:23:42] he said i am the voice of one
[1:23:44] crying in the wilderness malcolm 3 and
[1:23:48] the different ones hey so he wasn't
[1:23:49] mount kai four
[1:23:52] he wasn't the fourth coming of elijah he
[1:23:54] was the third
[1:23:55] elijah elisha elijah elijah elisha
[1:24:00] john the baptist they had to be in
[1:24:02] fourth one on malachi 4
[1:24:04] and then one of the two witnesses which
[1:24:05] is moses and elijah that go to the jews
[1:24:09] i've told you many times before just
[1:24:10] look in their tradition the jewish
[1:24:12] tradition they are looking for elijah to
[1:24:14] show up
[1:24:16] why can't we realize elijah had to show
[1:24:18] up
[1:24:19] we had to have a gentile elijah to show
[1:24:22] up
[1:24:23] and then that elijah is going to go as
[1:24:25] spirit of elijah number five is going to
[1:24:27] the jews
[1:24:28] because they're already looking for him
[1:24:31] every year at that set their sedar they
[1:24:34] set
[1:24:34] in front of them a cup
[1:24:38] because they believe elijah's got to
[1:24:39] show up before the messiah shows up
[1:24:42] well he did it was john the baptist they
[1:24:44] missed that one
[1:24:46] they missed the fourth one too because
[1:24:48] he was to the gentiles
[1:24:49] he wasn't to them but who was he too
[1:24:52] behold i will send
[1:24:53] you elijah the prophet before the coming
[1:24:57] of the great
[1:24:58] and dreadful day of the lord
[1:25:02] and look there's many people in the
[1:25:03] world many denominations read this and
[1:25:05] they think that this is the spirit of
[1:25:10] elijah
[1:25:12] a personal pronoun right he
[1:25:16] shall turn the heart not hearts one
[1:25:19] heart
[1:25:20] right he shall turn the heart of what
[1:25:23] of the fathers to the children
[1:25:26] which was john the baptist from the old
[1:25:29] fathers of the old testament
[1:25:31] looking for jehovah right right right
[1:25:35] to where john stands on the shores of
[1:25:38] jordan and says behold the lamb of god
[1:25:41] that takes away the sin of the world he
[1:25:43] br he brings
[1:25:44] children into being to begin the baby
[1:25:47] form of the new testament
[1:25:49] but from that baby form brothers and
[1:25:51] sisters from between that and
[1:25:54] and this right here there's been 30 000
[1:25:56] different ways that they think it's
[1:25:58] going to happen
[1:26:01] right yes we know god's not that
[1:26:03] confused so what's he going to do
[1:26:05] he's going to send us
[1:26:08] elijah the prophet before the great and
[1:26:11] dreadful day of the lord
[1:26:12] and he shall turn the heart of the
[1:26:14] fathers to the children
[1:26:16] and the heart of the children what
[1:26:20] pentecostal babies that had most good
[1:26:23] truths but not all of it
[1:26:25] pentecostal babies to what
[1:26:28] back to the faith of the fathers where
[1:26:30] there was
[1:26:31] zero denomination in these church ages
[1:26:35] amen
[1:26:38] that's what you and i have been brought
[1:26:42] unless i come and smite the earth right
[1:26:46] with the curse this earth is cursed
[1:26:51] but now remember
[1:26:56] there's only one group of people at this
[1:26:58] moment of time looking for elijah to
[1:27:00] show up
[1:27:02] and that's the jews
[1:27:06] this elijah that we had in the end time
[1:27:08] he's already gone off the scene
[1:27:13] but if he did nothing else he brought us
[1:27:15] the hidden mystery
[1:27:17] that had been hid before the foundation
[1:27:19] of the world that man has buried
[1:27:22] man buried it because jesus said by your
[1:27:25] tradition
[1:27:27] you've made the word of god none
[1:27:29] effective now
[1:27:30] i'm sure confidence is that's what he
[1:27:32] hated so bad caiaphas was looking at him
[1:27:34] and went
[1:27:34] what do you mean man i wash the pots
[1:27:37] like i'm supposed to in the old
[1:27:38] testament
[1:27:39] i put four or seven rams on top of the
[1:27:41] altar and i
[1:27:42] i sacrifice seven bullocks and i i do
[1:27:45] everything i'm supposed to do in the old
[1:27:46] testament
[1:27:48] but they were off somewhere because he
[1:27:50] said by your tradition
[1:27:53] by your denominational idea you have
[1:27:56] made the word of god
[1:27:57] of none of facts and that's what's
[1:28:00] happened in this time
[1:28:01] how can god be so confused to have 1200
[1:28:05] different ways of looking at this one
[1:28:07] bible
[1:28:08] just in our borders of 50 states of the
[1:28:10] united states
[1:28:12] god can't be that confused
[1:28:16] so you pray
[1:28:19] you pray that god will send you the
[1:28:21] truth amen
[1:28:23] apart from all the other ideas of the
[1:28:26] world amen
[1:28:28] you pray because you know what we
[1:28:32] probably still do have some ideas of our
[1:28:33] own
[1:28:38] but paul said musicians come paul
[1:28:41] said now we have
[1:28:44] the mind of christ
[1:28:48] and i believe what those seals brought
[1:28:50] us
[1:28:52] was not i mean the mind of christ has
[1:28:53] been is connected to the new birth
[1:28:56] right if you have the new birth you have
[1:28:58] the mind of christ
[1:29:00] but you and i have not let it work
[1:29:04] like it's supposed to work
[1:29:09] by my traditions i've made the word of
[1:29:12] god of none effect
[1:29:14] by my traditions of not believing what
[1:29:17] god's already said
[1:29:18] by my traditions of believing not
[1:29:21] believing that by his stripes i'm healed
[1:29:24] but we got to keep believing and keep
[1:29:26] believing and keep believing it
[1:29:28] he that overcometh
[1:29:32] not he that lay down and just give up he
[1:29:35] that overcometh
[1:29:38] shall inherit all things the bible tells
[1:29:40] us amen
[1:29:41] let's stand to our feet it started as a
[1:29:44] baby folks but we're not dealing with a
[1:29:46] baby
[1:29:49] you know who was it um
[1:29:53] oh what were we talking about the other
[1:29:54] day somebody was teaching somebody how
[1:29:56] to play
[1:29:56] oh lily somebody was teaching literally
[1:29:58] how to play checkers
[1:30:00] well lily's a baby lily's four or five
[1:30:05] and the 21 year old man teaching her kid
[1:30:08] was teaching her how to play checkers
[1:30:11] well now if me and joe played that guy
[1:30:14] he might not have a chance but he was
[1:30:17] playing with a baby the baby didn't know
[1:30:21] didn't know about capturing and making
[1:30:24] kings and how you can move about you
[1:30:26] know what i'm saying you understand what
[1:30:27] i'm saying
[1:30:28] but that guy did because he was 21 years
[1:30:30] old he was an adult
[1:30:33] he was harder to beat satan is harder to
[1:30:37] beat
[1:30:39] because he's got the tactics and
[1:30:41] everything that you and i have for the
[1:30:43] end time he's standing right beside of
[1:30:45] it
[1:30:47] and he's and he's even today i believe
[1:30:49] he's probably laughing and saying huh
[1:30:51] he thinks there's 1200 different
[1:30:52] denominations he said i'm standing right
[1:30:54] there in their church
[1:30:56] whoa oh
[1:31:00] that brings it home doesn't it but
[1:31:03] any doctrine outside
[1:31:06] of the pure word of god is the devil
[1:31:09] it is antichrist amen
[1:31:12] any idea we have is anti-word
[1:31:17] any idea so we that's why the idea
[1:31:21] when paul says we have the mind of
[1:31:23] christ you get ideas in your what in
[1:31:24] your mind
[1:31:26] we need to quit having our why old wives
[1:31:30] fables and get back to the word of god
[1:31:35] there's a song now on the radio that is
[1:31:38] if he said it i believe it
[1:31:39] i doubt it i said i doubt it the bible
[1:31:42] you know the song is if he said it i
[1:31:44] believe it if he said it i believe it
[1:31:46] yeah okay
[1:31:47] let's point to some of these places in
[1:31:48] here and see if they believe it
[1:31:51] but how about you and me that's been
[1:31:53] shown the truth
[1:31:54] that knows what that scripture says and
[1:31:56] somebody says you believe
[1:31:58] that we go yep sure do and i'll tell you
[1:32:00] exactly where that came from
[1:32:04] we're not know-it-alls but we do have
[1:32:06] the mind of christ
[1:32:08] i believe we do i believe we are known
[1:32:10] we
[1:32:11] the secret hidden mysteries of god has
[1:32:13] been made known to the end time bride
[1:32:15] and that's what satan has that's what
[1:32:18] satan has had
[1:32:19] sorry in his corner is that darkness of
[1:32:22] revelation he's had that in his corner
[1:32:26] because god has not revealed it to
[1:32:28] luther wesley
[1:32:30] yeah pentecost but he's revealed it to
[1:32:32] me and you that's why he hates it
[1:32:34] because you know what it exposes him
[1:32:36] shows exactly where he is shows exactly
[1:32:38] what he's doing
[1:32:40] and until we get out of here he's right
[1:32:43] here
[1:32:45] he's dealing in my head right now he's
[1:32:47] dealing in your head right now he's
[1:32:49] dealing with us
[1:32:51] but he can't deal with the heart because
[1:32:52] you know what we got to say look
[1:32:54] whatever you do devil what's down inside
[1:32:58] i know what truth is i know what truth
[1:33:01] is
[1:33:02] i don't have to be swayed by 1200
[1:33:04] different ideas
[1:33:07] this is it or not this is it
[1:33:11] or or brother right we just go home eat
[1:33:13] drink and be married the bible says
[1:33:15] this is it young people there is nothing
[1:33:18] beside this word of god
[1:33:22] nothing oh yeah we have to live our
[1:33:25] human life sure we have to do all the
[1:33:27] different things that we do
[1:33:28] but when you take it back to this and
[1:33:29] it's contrary to this then just be
[1:33:31] careful
[1:33:32] just be careful with it okay just be
[1:33:34] careful with it let's sing a song god
[1:33:35] bless you
[1:33:36] let's sing this remember all these that
[1:33:38] are sick
[1:33:40] satan's on the rampage we're getting a
[1:33:43] revival started and the devil's starting
[1:33:45] one itself

[1:34:38] went to calvary just for you
[1:34:43] just for you
[1:34:51] [Music]
[1:34:55] and it's not the chemistry of the blood
[1:34:57] it's the life that was in that blood
[1:35:02] [Music]
[1:35:12] i just claimed those precious blood
[1:35:16] stains
[1:35:16] sing it one more time oh and i claim the
[1:35:21] blood
[1:35:23] that jesus shared all calvary

[1:36:08] this thing reach out and touch the lord
[1:36:09] just one time that's okay
[1:36:12] reach out and touch the lord as he
[1:36:20] passes
[1:36:22] you will find he's not too busy
[1:36:28] to hear your hearts cry
[1:36:32] oh he is
[1:36:42] [Music]
[1:36:49] they sing it one more time and literally
[1:36:52] reach out
[1:36:54] and touch the lord as he
[1:36:59] passes by
[1:37:02] you will find he's
[1:37:17] do you have a need reach
[1:37:26] as he goes by reach out and touch
[1:37:34] the lord as he
[1:37:38] passes by
[1:37:41] and you will find he's not too busy
[1:37:46] to
[1:37:55] [Music]
[1:37:56] [Applause]
[1:38:00] reach
[1:38:04] [Music]
[1:38:10] [Music]
[1:38:14] she said if i could but touch
[1:38:18] the hem of that man's garment i don't
[1:38:21] need to hug him
[1:38:22] i don't need to grab a hold of his feet
[1:38:25] i just need to touch him as he walks by
[1:38:29] just reach out and jesus turned around
[1:38:32] and said who touched me
[1:38:35] because strength had went from him not
[1:38:36] that people were physically touching him
[1:38:38] hundreds of people were physically
[1:38:40] touching him
[1:38:41] but she touched something that no one
[1:38:43] had touched before
[1:38:45] she touched that virtue that healing
[1:38:47] power
[1:38:48] and she just reached and touched that
[1:38:50] garment
[1:38:51] and bless her heart you know what kind
[1:38:54] of issue she had she couldn't go to
[1:38:56] church
[1:38:58] she had 12 years
[1:39:01] of bleeding
[1:39:02] [Music]
[1:39:04] we think we have problems sometimes 12
[1:39:06] years
[1:39:08] she was unclean the bible said according
[1:39:11] to the old testament she was unclean for
[1:39:13] 12 years couldn't go to church
[1:39:15] because of her issue but what did she
[1:39:19] say
[1:39:21] the bible said in her heart
[1:39:24] she perceived that the issue had stopped
[1:39:28] and jesus said who touched me
[1:39:31] and then i believe the the crowd parted
[1:39:34] back and
[1:39:34] there she stood he said
[1:39:38] sister by your faith
[1:39:43] you have touched the master
[1:39:47] you have touched something
[1:39:49] [Music]
[1:39:50] that no man has touched before
[1:39:54] and that's a healing power and virtue
[1:39:57] you know jesus was real at that time
[1:39:59] this was not a story this was a real
[1:40:00] what happened in the bible he was a real
[1:40:02] man standing there and she was a real
[1:40:03] woman
[1:40:04] you know what he's just as real today as
[1:40:06] he was back then
[1:40:07] he's actually more real because he's
[1:40:09] walking in me and you all over the world
[1:40:11] amen and you don't know who you've
[1:40:13] touched you don't know who you spoke to
[1:40:16] you don't know who you've
[1:40:17] many times just give them a pat on the
[1:40:19] back and say god bless you
[1:40:20] and you're going through an issue in
[1:40:22] your life or a problem in your life and
[1:40:24] somebody walks by and lord how many
[1:40:26] times brother joe if somebody said
[1:40:28] i sure appreciate it i needed that phone
[1:40:30] call why you had an
[1:40:31] unction you had an unction from god
[1:40:36] to call so-and-so don't pass that by
[1:40:41] because as the song says reach out and
[1:40:42] touch the lord you know if she had not
[1:40:44] touched the hem of his garments she
[1:40:46] would have not got healed
[1:40:48] because they said she had been the
[1:40:49] doctors for all that many years and
[1:40:51] spent all of her money
[1:40:53] trying to get healed by a doctor on this
[1:40:55] earth
[1:40:56] but when the great physician walked by
[1:40:59] the only prescription he gave her was is
[1:41:01] by my stripes
[1:41:04] according to isaiah by my stripes you're
[1:41:07] healed
[1:41:08] he hasn't even been to calvary yet but
[1:41:10] he was given a scripture that had
[1:41:12] already been written in the old
[1:41:13] testament
[1:41:14] that she believed oh my
[1:41:20] just reach out and touch him today one
[1:41:22] more time
[1:41:23] reach out and touch the lord as he
[1:41:30] passes
[1:41:32] [Music]
[1:41:37] he didn't just keep walking that day no
[1:41:39] he stopped and turned around and said
[1:41:41] lady
[1:41:42] you're healed
[1:41:51] reach out and touch the lord
[1:41:56] i see
[1:42:01] listen we are getting our day of
[1:42:04] visitation
[1:42:06] god is visiting his people for the last
[1:42:08] time
[1:42:09] because he's going to visit us and then
[1:42:11] he's going to israel and when he goes to
[1:42:13] israel i don't care
[1:42:14] see there's another denominational idea
[1:42:15] that you can be left behind and you can
[1:42:17] be saved
[1:42:18] during the seven years of tribulation
[1:42:20] which there's no such thing see
[1:42:21] all those old tales those are just tales
[1:42:24] they're not true
[1:42:26] they're lies but it's been fabricated
[1:42:28] over the years for us to believe that
[1:42:30] but they ain't gonna be when you're left
[1:42:32] behind you're behind
[1:42:35] we're going in a rapture there'll be no
[1:42:36] more gentiles saved after we leave
[1:42:39] the bible says the door to the gentile
[1:42:40] church will be closed
[1:42:42] they'll be weeping wailing gnashing of
[1:42:44] teeth
[1:42:46] god's going to go to israel and save 144
[1:42:48] 000
[1:42:49] and then we're going to meet him back
[1:42:50] down here after a wonderful wedding
[1:42:53] supper
[1:42:57] amen remember practice if you're going
[1:43:00] to sing
[1:43:01] at what's not service practice here
