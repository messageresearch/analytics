[25:40] haven't exhausted it yet blessed be the
[25:43] God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[25:45] who has blessed us with all spiritual
[25:46] blessings in Heavenly places in Christ
[25:50] according as he has chosen Us in him
[25:52] before the foundation of the world that
[25:53] we should be holy and Without Blame
[25:55] before him in love having predestinated
[25:58] us unto the adoption of children by
[26:00] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[26:03] good pleasure of his will to the praise
[26:05] of the glory of his grace wherein he
[26:07] hath made us accepted in the Beloved all
[26:12] right let's go
[26:14] to Second Peter 3 and these are the
[26:17] scriptures that brother Bram if you
[26:19] remember on the message of the future
[26:23] home was using all right second Peter
[26:28] the third chapter this Second Epistle
[26:31] beloved I now write unto you in both
[26:33] which I stir up your pure Minds by way
[26:35] of remembrance that you may may be
[26:38] mindful of The Words which were spoken
[26:39] before by the holy prophets and the of
[26:42] The Commandments of us the Apostles of
[26:44] the Lord and Savior knowing this that
[26:47] there shall come in the last days
[26:48] scoffers walking after their own lust
[26:51] and saying where is the promise of his
[26:53] coming for since the fathers fell asleep
[26:55] all things continue as they were were
[26:57] before were from the foundation of the
[27:00] creation for this they willingly are
[27:03] ignorant of that by the word of God now
[27:06] listen here's where the scriptures are
[27:08] probably was picking up now for this by
[27:11] for this they willingly are ignorant of
[27:14] that by the word of God the heavens were
[27:16] of old and the Earth standing out of the
[27:19] water and in the water whereby the world
[27:23] that then was being overflowed with
[27:25] water
[27:26] perished but the heavens and the Earth
[27:28] which are now by the same word are kept
[27:31] in store reserved unto fire against the
[27:35] day of judgment and predition of ungodly
[27:38] men but beloved be not ignorant of this
[27:41] one thing that one day is that one day
[27:45] is with the Lord as a thousand years and
[27:47] a thousand years is one day the Lord is
[27:49] not slack concerning his promise as some
[27:52] men count slackness but is longsuffering
[27:55] to us not willing that any should should
[27:57] perish but that all should come to
[27:59] repentance but the day of the Lord will
[28:02] come as a thief in the night into which
[28:04] the heavens shall pass away with a great
[28:07] noise and the elements shall melt with
[28:09] fervent heat the Earth also and the
[28:11] works that are th end shall be burned
[28:14] seeing then that all these things shall
[28:16] be dissolved what manner of person ought
[28:19] we to be in all holy conversation and
[28:22] godliness looking for and hastening to
[28:25] the coming of the day of God where in
[28:28] the heavens being on fire shall be
[28:30] dissolved and the element shall melt
[28:33] with fervent heat nevertheless we
[28:35] according to his promise look for new
[28:37] heavens and a new Earth wherein dwelleth
[28:40] righteousness all right let's go over to
[28:43] Revelations
[28:44] now
[28:52] 21 verse one and I saw a new Heaven and
[28:55] a new Earth for the first heaven and the
[28:57] first Earth First Earth were passed away
[29:01] there was no more sea and I John saw the
[29:03] holy city New Jerusalem coming down from
[29:05] God out of Heaven prepared as a bride
[29:08] Adorn for her husband and I heard a
[29:10] great voice out of Heaven saying behold
[29:13] the Tabernacle of God is with men and he
[29:16] will dwell with them and they shall be
[29:18] his people and God himself shall be with
[29:21] them and be their God and God shall wipe
[29:23] away all tears from their eyes and there
[29:26] shall be no more death neither sorrow
[29:28] nor crying neither shall there be any
[29:31] more pain for the former things are past
[29:35] away you may be seated the Lord add his
[29:37] Blessing to the reading of the word I
[29:40] got a lot of
[29:42] quotes and uh I almost printed the
[29:46] entire book of the future home for you
[29:48] but you know I just pray that you will
[29:53] go read the the book amen and be able to
[29:56] get a whole lot lot more than what I
[30:00] could dare to try to say or impart unto
[30:03] you but
[30:05] now I hope you understood what I was
[30:07] trying to bring this morning of the uh
[30:12] the message of showing
[30:15] that you
[30:17] know that first one I want a Divine
[30:20] Healing
[30:21] campaign all right and then a message
[30:24] followed that he in campaign and the
[30:29] prophet would not let somebody else
[30:30] preach it for him he preached his own
[30:32] message because they wouldn't be
[30:33] bringing it the way that he wanted it
[30:35] brought right so he you know they he he
[30:39] brought his own message because it was
[30:40] the restoration of the word or the faith
[30:45] Revelation faith of the fathers that had
[30:50] to be brought back to the church all
[30:52] right and in that then there would be a
[30:56] healing campaign
[30:57] go out to catch the attention of the
[31:00] people and they could receive the word
[31:02] then you know that would be uh spoken
[31:06] unto them and and it would bring them to
[31:09] a reality of how that God is living
[31:13] among us because that's the purpose of
[31:16] of the uh the healing campaign was to
[31:19] show that and anybody just picking up on
[31:21] these please go back and get the other
[31:23] messages because I can't try to cover
[31:26] everything in one that's right all right
[31:29] and we know that the prophet as we said
[31:32] this morning he continually said you
[31:34] know no Divine Healing no Resurrection
[31:39] that's no Divine Healing No Redemption
[31:42] of the body all right but there was a
[31:45] Divine Healing campaign went out see
[31:49] with a great signs and wonders to get
[31:52] the attention of the people right and
[31:54] then they they would turn away from you
[31:56] know the things and it was exactly like
[31:59] in the ministry of the Lord Jesus when
[32:02] he first began that everybody wanted the
[32:05] you know the young Prophet to come and
[32:08] speak unto them but when he begin to say
[32:10] I and my father are one see then they
[32:13] begin to pull away from him all right
[32:15] and as they did then see uh it showed
[32:18] what they
[32:19] were all right so in the last days God
[32:22] didn't just send a message out that's
[32:26] cuz as I said and emphasized over and
[32:28] over look how hard it would be for
[32:31] brother Brandon to actually have to
[32:33] preach to people about the uh you know
[32:37] the healing of the body and and trying
[32:40] to get them to see it and then to to try
[32:43] to express to them that they wern't
[32:46] going to get a new body because
[32:47] everybody believed they were right you
[32:49] know all right and and like I said then
[32:52] not even in their carnality looked like
[32:54] they would have looked up the word
[32:56] Resurrection yeah because everybody
[32:58] saids oh we believe in the resurrection
[33:00] yeah yes we believe in the resurrection
[33:03] to come but Resurrection does not mean
[33:06] replacement see what what our thoughts
[33:08] of Resurrection was is just raise up you
[33:11] know raise up
[33:14] well you know why if God's going to give
[33:17] a new
[33:19] body all right right now are you
[33:21] listening if God is going to give you a
[33:24] new body right why would it be dealing
[33:27] with Resurrection that's right
[33:29] am is it going to raise up a new body
[33:33] why don't you just speak
[33:35] it see you wouldn't have to use the word
[33:38] Resurrection see and in that way see we
[33:42] we we in our own Super religious way of
[33:46] thinking and listening to Mankind we
[33:49] wound up by denying what the word of God
[33:52] was actually saying and even the words
[33:54] that we were saying ourselves amen and
[33:56] and I said we talk about resurrection
[33:58] and I brought that out from John there
[34:01] of where Mary see our M excuse me she uh
[34:05] oh yes Lazarus will raise in the last
[34:09] days see job in the last days out there
[34:13] see because mankind wanted to believe in
[34:15] the
[34:16] resurrection well but see Jesus then
[34:19] said I am the
[34:21] resurrection see all right now we
[34:24] haven't got to that one yet we haven't
[34:27] got to that point of what he's saying
[34:29] but I wanted you to understand and read
[34:32] that scripture in John because he said
[34:34] he that not only I am the resurrection
[34:37] he one only said he that believeth in me
[34:39] right shall not die right all right he
[34:43] was speaking all the way to a total
[34:47] Redemption that's right right right
[34:49] there in the scriptures see that man
[34:52] shall not die all right see then you
[34:55] know going on to that somebody's going
[34:57] to be alive and be changed as Paul calls
[34:59] it the moment the twinkle of an eye and
[35:01] see the Lord Jesus spoke of it all right
[35:04] and then bringing it out we were talking
[35:07] about how that he had a great ministry
[35:08] in his early years and then you know
[35:10] seemingly when the opening of the of the
[35:13] uh the seals of Matthew 24 to the Lord
[35:16] Jesus then where's he headed to Calvary
[35:19] that's right not a lot said not a lot
[35:21] done he was heading to Calvary but the
[35:23] greatest of all things through the
[35:25] opening of those seeds in Matthew 24
[35:28] that he preached them you know then you
[35:30] see brother Bram and he starts off in a
[35:33] healing campaign and and and a a
[35:35] Ministry following the faith of the
[35:37] fathers and but then he comes to a place
[35:39] that it seems to be just going
[35:42] downward and see then when he does then
[35:45] he comes forth to bring his message amen
[35:48] cuz his message was not a restoration of
[35:51] the faith of the fathers that had to be
[35:53] brought right but he was to bring us the
[35:56] complete plan
[35:57] of Redemption all right now the complete
[36:00] Plan of Redemption see would have to
[36:04] deal with not only the soul of
[36:07] mankind but it would have to deal with
[36:09] the body all right so then we could you
[36:12] know maybe some people begin to listen
[36:14] to brother brandom as he began to talk
[36:16] about you know the Redemption of the
[36:18] body but still they wasn't picking up on
[36:22] it and one day he preached a message
[36:23] called the future home of the Heavenly
[36:26] bridegroom and Earthly bride all right
[36:28] and as he preached that we just term it
[36:30] future home but really it's Heavenly
[36:32] bridegroom and Earthly bride I think
[36:35] what stated all right
[36:37] now when he be to bring that
[36:40] see he went into talking about the
[36:43] Redemption of this
[36:44] world well that really would be a shock
[36:47] to mankind you know religious people
[36:51] couldn't follow that tone because oh as
[36:54] we just read here in Peter and we just
[36:56] read in Revelation that this world and
[36:59] all that we see is going to be just it's
[37:01] going to be we read it it's going to be
[37:04] annihilated everything is going to be
[37:06] Anni well where are we
[37:08] going where are we going to live what
[37:11] are we going to do if you're going to
[37:12] annihilate this world do you realize if
[37:15] you annihilate this
[37:17] world you would interrupt the whole
[37:19] solar system that's right right and what
[37:22] would happen to the entire solar system
[37:25] see and and all like that but we we see
[37:28] we didn't think of those things all
[37:30] right but then he he was bringing it out
[37:32] so we could understand the complete Plan
[37:35] of
[37:36] Redemption see that was his message then
[37:39] was to bring us the complete Plan of
[37:41] Redemption and we read about six or
[37:43] eight quotes there where the Prophet was
[37:45] saying like the Rapture and the
[37:46] different ones where he was saying that
[37:48] not in the years of preparation not in
[37:51] the healing campaign right his message
[37:54] started through the opening of the seals
[37:57] that was for him to bring the other had
[37:59] already been brought the faith of the
[38:02] fathers had already been brought by the
[38:04] apostles right he didn't have to come
[38:06] and bring us the Bible right see but he
[38:10] had to come and pick up where the where
[38:12] the apostles left off that's right that
[38:16] would have to be continued on and the
[38:18] apostles never spoke of the son of
[38:21] man now they wrote Matthew Mark Luke and
[38:24] John yes cuz that's the writing of the
[38:25] Lord Jesus and of what he say it but
[38:27] where did Paul even mention the son of
[38:29] man right it wasn't there he didn't even
[38:33] talk about it right none of those
[38:35] understood here comes a prophet then
[38:37] during his time of restoring the faith
[38:39] he starts talking about son of
[38:42] man Resurrection
[38:44] sign see and God was there performing
[38:48] The Resurrection sign in the prophet's
[38:51] Ministry not the prophet now the man was
[38:53] a man is like you and I right but God
[38:56] begin to use him to bring those things
[38:59] and to show what you and I would have to
[39:02] have in the last days all right we've
[39:04] been over that but see then coming to
[39:07] that position then he would bring his
[39:10] message right brother this message was a
[39:13] message of eternal life I even asked you
[39:15] to do one
[39:16] thing we have some books downstairs if
[39:19] you don't have one I know I've got a
[39:20] couple anyway of the uh the titles of
[39:23] all the sermons most of you probably
[39:26] have that you know the little book it'll
[39:28] show you the titles of all the sermons I
[39:30] would ask you to go after the seals open
[39:32] in 63 to the prophet and just read the
[39:35] titles
[39:37] right just read the titles of the
[39:42] sermon right the old in the old days it
[39:46] was what
[39:48] demonology uh you
[39:50] know some kind of a something dealing in
[39:53] life but after the seals broke look what
[39:55] it was future home Christ the Myster of
[39:58] God revealed things that are to be who
[40:00] is this MDC Mighty God
[40:03] unveiled read them just just read the
[40:05] titles of the
[40:07] sermons and you'll see that it it it's
[40:10] bringing forth eternal life right see
[40:14] cuz that was his message was to bring us
[40:16] the message of eternal life that's what
[40:18] caught me when I when I heard the the
[40:21] prophet
[40:22] talking it it caught me to see that hey
[40:26] you you know we was like this we was oh
[40:28] yes bless God one of these days one of
[40:30] these days we're going up to heaven we
[40:33] don't know what we're going to do we may
[40:35] sit on the clouds and I'll be tickled to
[40:37] play hard you know oh we could really
[40:39] make great emphasis you know and we
[40:41] could really make people just feel good
[40:43] you know I'll be glad to do whatever God
[40:46] wants me to
[40:47] do but here comes a prophet talking
[40:49] about us living here right right amen
[40:52] and bringing out the Bible about us
[40:54] living
[40:55] here
[40:57] y that's hard to
[41:00] understand you think it was hard for him
[41:02] to preach in his early Ministries I said
[41:04] this morning am to try to show people
[41:08] what a resurrection is and Divine
[41:10] Healing what the proof of it how much
[41:11] more would it
[41:12] be to coming after the opening of the
[41:16] seals cuz if you followed me and what
[41:18] the reading we read this
[41:20] morning those quotes were all after the
[41:23] seals broke right and all of them just
[41:25] about it even even mentions the seals in
[41:27] it of not in the years of preparation
[41:29] but when the seals begin to break right
[41:32] see that was the thing that was to be
[41:34] preached in this day was the opening of
[41:37] the seals which would open up the entire
[41:39] word right see then I told you about
[41:42] that the prophet would say first pull
[41:44] Divine
[41:46] Healing second pull
[41:49] prophecy all right and see then that
[41:52] would be there's a difference between
[41:54] the word prophecy and prophesy right
[41:56] right and if I spell it wrong you put it
[41:58] in the right place okay you know but see
[42:02] one of them means what you're
[42:05] saying the other one means the the push
[42:08] from behind you or the the you know you
[42:12] and what you're doing see a prophet
[42:15] would come forth and bringing it and say
[42:18] thus sayith the Lord so and so is going
[42:20] to take place see that was him
[42:23] prophesying or you know the why deal on
[42:28] but whereas the other would be what he
[42:29] sent forth from his lips the
[42:32] prophecy see a prophet would say so and
[42:35] so and so and so is going to happen
[42:37] that's a prophecy that'll take place
[42:38] maybe thousands of years
[42:41] later but his voice was speaking of what
[42:45] God had give him to say all right so
[42:47] then I figured well you know a lot of
[42:49] people they they won't look them up
[42:51] anyway but you know you do it oh beside
[42:53] the way uh some of you need to get your
[42:55] T tapes out out of the rack we've cut
[42:57] down on the amount of spaces for you and
[42:59] please get your tapes out of the racks
[43:01] downstairs and go around in the back
[43:03] back here where the the new place is at
[43:05] where Richard is at and right there on
[43:07] the wall is your text you know of the
[43:09] services and brother Richard and them
[43:11] and all that's on the wall and they're
[43:13] getting a good many in there cuz I'm the
[43:15] one that puts in Brother Richard so
[43:16] evidently some of you not listening it's
[43:19] hard to listen with a tape sticking in
[43:20] that rack down there I found that
[43:24] out okay
[43:27] okay forgive me for being that way but
[43:30] now listen let's just read you got it I
[43:32] gave it to you it's on one that's has
[43:34] got a no back on it all right let's just
[43:37] read see in the Bible you use
[43:41] prophecy and that prophecy p r o p h e c
[43:46] y is dealing with prophesying it's
[43:49] number
[43:51] 4394 prophecy in other words a
[43:55] discourse
[43:56] emitting I guess the way you say it
[43:58] emanating emanating okay from divine
[44:02] inspiration and declaring the purposes
[44:05] of God see that's what this p r o p h e
[44:08] see why I mean right Amen in other words
[44:10] the prophet saying it but when it goes
[44:13] out you've got to wait for some time for
[44:15] it to take place at a later date see
[44:18] whether by reproving or admonishing the
[44:20] wicked or comforting The Afflicted or
[44:23] revealing things hidden especially by
[44:26] foretelling future
[44:28] events see all right used in the New
[44:32] Testament over the utterance of the Old
[44:34] Testament prophets of the prediction of
[44:37] events relating to Christ's Kingdom and
[44:39] is speedly triumph see that's why he
[44:42] said that the word prophecy is a setting
[44:44] in order of scripture p r o p h e c y is
[44:48] a setting of or in order of the
[44:50] scriptures cuz those prophets would
[44:52] bring it the New Testament picks up what
[44:54] they're saying and brings it into
[44:57] order the Old Testament scriptures Paul
[45:00] took the Old Testament and brought into
[45:03] order and and laid those things in order
[45:05] to show you who mzd was and things like
[45:08] that but whereas the p p s Dro down is
[45:15] 4394 Prophet speak p r o p h e s y to to
[45:19] prophecy in other words to be a prophet
[45:22] speak forth by divine inspiration to
[45:24] predict with the idea of foretelling
[45:26] future events pertaining his ESP To The
[45:28] Kingdom looks like almost the same
[45:30] wording right but see one of them is the
[45:33] prophet speaking it the other one is
[45:37] what he
[45:39] says see going out and and telling you
[45:42] of future things all right see then I
[45:45] told you brother Brown said the first
[45:47] pull was prophecy second pull
[45:51] was and I called it sitting in order the
[45:54] word the word so we look at it look on
[45:56] your notes right above there which is
[45:58] paragraph or page 41 souls in prison now
[46:02] 631 1110 the morning service the first
[46:06] three three is perfection that's when
[46:08] the ministry went forth the second pull
[46:11] was the discernment of spirits of
[46:13] Prophecy first was the healing of the
[46:15] sick the second was the prophecy that
[46:18] went forth that no the secret of the
[46:21] thoughts listen when the word itself was
[46:24] made manifest
[46:26] which that's Grace all right now that's
[46:29] Hebrews
[46:31] 4:12 Hebrews 4:12 is the way brother
[46:34] random knew what this disease is worth
[46:35] what I said this morning he could take
[46:37] you by the hand that show up the bubbles
[46:39] the thing but something happened when he
[46:40] say it's in your left lung
[46:43] right see that was going on into the
[46:47] interior all right watch he goes on
[46:52] down page 46 if the first and and second
[46:56] pull is without question is there a
[46:59] question in your mind about the first
[47:00] and second pull did it come to pass just
[47:03] as he said then why question the third
[47:07] see why would you question the first two
[47:09] was identified by the
[47:11] scripture I've proved to you this
[47:13] morning that the third's identified by
[47:15] the scripture too look upon the world
[47:18] and see where she's at look how they
[47:20] have rejected the truth and how it's
[47:23] been properly identified the prophecy
[47:26] part see they've rejected the prophecy
[47:28] the truth see all right going down now
[47:31] to anointed ones at the end time
[47:33] 65725 notice the very day when this
[47:36] messenger not when he starts on the but
[47:39] when he begins to declare his
[47:42] message see the first pull healing
[47:45] second pull prophesying third pull the
[47:48] opening of the word the Mysteries
[47:51] revealed all so now would be enough to
[47:54] bring it to you there one more that I
[47:56] didn't bring but it's page 41 of souls
[47:58] in prison and he says that uh anybody
[48:03] believed him seemed like is that right
[48:05] when he went forth Healing The Sick
[48:07] everybody wanted him in their church but
[48:09] one day he turned around and started
[48:11] prophesying what for he was the word he
[48:15] was the prophet that Moses spoke of now
[48:18] that sound like he just started turning
[48:19] around prophesying now watch what the
[48:22] prophet said he done and when he went to
[48:24] telling them and and how that they were
[48:26] living and the things they were doing he
[48:29] became very unpopular that was his
[48:33] second pull all right so just follow the
[48:36] point of what I'm
[48:38] saying there an arguments you can people
[48:41] say well what is the first what is the
[48:43] what well he said it was the opening of
[48:45] the word so that's that's up to you
[48:46] whatever you want to argue the point I'm
[48:48] not going to argue with you about it I
[48:50] just try to preach the gospel all right
[48:52] but get what I'm saying the prophet's
[48:55] message began through the opening of the
[48:58] word of the seals that had not been
[48:59] brought right his early Ministry was a
[49:02] restoration of about what the original
[49:05] doctrine of the faith of the
[49:06] fathers right cuz that was not there in
[49:10] people we had gotten totally away from
[49:12] the original Faith but he did and when
[49:15] it did now watch the third pull being
[49:19] the opening of the
[49:21] word compare the days of the Prophet as
[49:24] I said this morning morning compare his
[49:26] early Ministry to his last days of his
[49:30] ministry now like here is Brother Gary
[49:32] CR brother Hal sitting back there that
[49:34] the only that's the two in joy and uh
[49:38] we're sitting there uh
[49:40] Charlotte and were sitting there when
[49:44] the prophets you know when brother R was
[49:46] bringing his ministry but in the early
[49:48] days it was just healing after healing
[49:50] after healing after healing but then it
[49:52] got down to slower in the last days
[49:54] didn't it right lot less of it but what
[49:57] more
[49:58] powerful he was begin to speak the word
[50:01] and just say I prayed for a thousand
[50:03] people y said I believe they're healed
[50:06] but he said take that baby to the doctor
[50:08] little girl he said I guarantee you
[50:10] healing see he was coming into the third
[50:12] pull right all right now coming into
[50:15] that third pull of the opening of the
[50:17] word you don't see great things only
[50:19] like five seven times of the third pull
[50:22] that he
[50:23] mentions now I said mention because it
[50:25] happened plenty of times that he didn't
[50:27] tell us about right all right but see
[50:29] then in that there would have to be if
[50:32] that's true though that those things if
[50:34] there was a third pull of the speaking
[50:36] of the word right and healings and and
[50:39] deliverances like the storm the uh
[50:42] sister hat right the uh uh help me with
[50:45] it sister mey with the the growth and
[50:48] and you know all kind of things storm
[50:52] storm and about five times or six times
[50:55] the spoke well then it have to be a
[50:56] message
[50:58] right remember we read this morning if
[51:01] there if there's a message there's
[51:03] healing if there's healing there's a
[51:04] message right you said well what about
[51:06] them out there they're only gleaning off
[51:08] of what that we have
[51:10] amen that's right brother brandom on the
[51:13] said where they would say on that voice
[51:15] of healing magazine you know fast and
[51:17] pray for God to send a prophet he said
[51:19] they felt the pull right
[51:22] right they were only feasting off of the
[51:24] pull it was not for them see it was if
[51:28] they could accept it and believe it I
[51:31] see it was for for you and I all right
[51:35] now so the early
[51:38] Ministry dealt with the
[51:43] resurrection all right Lord Jesus early
[51:46] Ministry debt with Resurrection but then
[51:49] one day he began to say I and my
[51:51] father's one right and then he walked on
[51:54] to prove that his father and him was one
[51:57] because he preached what mankind knew
[51:59] nothing of Y
[52:02] see they may have been looking for a
[52:04] general Resurrection right but he said
[52:08] one day I am the resurrection
[52:12] amen and he went on to prove that he was
[52:15] the resurrection because he raised
[52:18] Lazarus the different ones he raised
[52:20] from the dead well here's the prophet's
[52:22] Ministry repeating in the end time that
[52:25] about seven times people raised from the
[52:29] dead see proving that the ministry of
[52:32] Jesus Christ was back here again
[52:34] standing in a man upon the Earth all
[52:37] right but for us to just keep looking at
[52:39] that I'm not doing that that's what all
[52:41] the preachers do see oh it was great and
[52:43] brother Rand his great back I believe
[52:45] that same God is here now amen that's
[52:48] right I don't back up no statements
[52:51] whatsoever with that I'm saying God's
[52:52] here I've seen him here I've seen him
[52:55] deliver and heal and raise the dead
[52:57] that's right so I don't back
[52:59] up the man's got the goods he ain't
[53:01] scared to put it
[53:03] out I'm not afraid to talk about the
[53:05] resurrection I'm not afraid to talk
[53:07] about these things the only thing I
[53:08] ain't seen now is blinded eyes
[53:10] open bless him that's the only thing I
[53:13] ain't seen cuz I've seen the dead rais I
[53:15] used to have to say I didn't see the
[53:16] dead rais didn't that come to pass so
[53:19] the Lord will send the other too but
[53:21] listen see when the Lord Jesus begin to
[53:24] say though I and my father are one the
[53:28] healing
[53:29] maybe uh what do you call it dropped off
[53:33] right the great things because nobody
[53:35] wouldn't comeing to hear him that's
[53:36] right that's it they didn't want to come
[53:38] and hear him they thought we're afraid
[53:40] to go hear him because all these
[53:42] Pharisees and Sadducees trying their
[53:43] best to kill this guy right so let's get
[53:46] away from him you know and that's the
[53:48] way it was in the last days the prophet
[53:50] used to preach to you know thousands of
[53:52] people in one meeting get down to 25 or
[53:54] 30 in a trailer I
[53:56] turn what is Arizona you know and stuff
[53:59] like that look like his ministry went
[54:02] totally down but it's greater and
[54:04] greater and greater amen but what it
[54:07] done it got rid of the garbage right
[54:09] amen now I don't mean that wrong cuz all
[54:11] of us started out garbage
[54:14] right that's all we are until God gets a
[54:17] hold of us right thank God for being
[54:20] able to believe a word amen like sister
[54:24] Gil talking her this morning and about
[54:26] the seeing this young girl you know she
[54:28] said I might not have been that bad but
[54:30] said ain't no difference right well
[54:32] that's true MH you see this nakedness
[54:35] going on out there and you say well i'
[54:36] never done that well that may be true
[54:38] that's right but what's the difference
[54:40] when you pull it on up a little right
[54:43] you know they don't see that on thing I
[54:44] jerk my pant's legs up you know then
[54:46] dresses starts and I noticed somewhere
[54:48] around year yours gets getting and just
[54:50] climb higher and higher and higher and
[54:51] higher and higher and just you know and
[54:53] then the talk goes lower lower and lower
[54:55] well you're responsible to God that's
[54:58] right cuz you know better right and
[55:00] God's Vindicated so you know better amen
[55:03] so go ahead I can't make you do nothing
[55:06] right anyway but see Jesus went on as I
[55:09] said when he said I am the
[55:13] resurrection I am what always been
[55:16] spoken
[55:17] of I'm the one that raise
[55:21] you and that's what I had in the
[55:23] scripture I used the other night but
[55:24] where if the spirit that within him be
[55:26] in you it'll also what Quicken what your
[55:31] mortal
[55:33] bodies am make alive these mortal bodies
[55:36] so Jesus goes on there in John 11 see 21
[55:41] through 26 to not only say I am the
[55:43] resurrection but he said he that
[55:45] believeth in me amen shall not die right
[55:49] spoke right on down to a chain of the
[55:51] body that somebody going to stand right
[55:53] here and not have to die
[55:56] and why can't we believe we're them come
[55:58] on I believed it for 40 years 40
[56:00] something years now why can't I believe
[56:02] it any further another old Baptist
[56:04] preacher said a you when I left he said
[56:06] ah Sam you'll be back in 6 months that's
[56:08] been the longest 6 months I've ever seen
[56:11] but have been about 40 something years
[56:12] now and and see I'm still looking at the
[56:16] same
[56:18] Resurrection but I'm beginning to see
[56:20] the message is real in reality all right
[56:22] now let's get on to it
[56:28] all right most people had their concept
[56:31] as I said this morning of the
[56:34] Resurrection but yet in that concept was
[56:37] like ma that it would be out there
[56:41] somewhere you know in the latter
[56:44] days and Jesus was trying to pull it
[56:46] down to the point of saying
[56:49] look you
[56:51] said now isn't it not this is this not
[56:54] in the scripture didn't Martha say if
[56:55] you'd have been
[56:57] here she had enough confidence in the
[57:01] man she said if you'd have been here my
[57:03] brother wouldn't have died just like
[57:05] Mary had enough
[57:07] confidence when it come down to the wine
[57:10] at the wedding you know and she said
[57:12] whatever he says do you do it a lot of
[57:15] confidence had gotten into the why
[57:17] because they had seen so much of God
[57:20] living among them well so is it in the
[57:23] last days amen
[57:25] why can't we believe it that
[57:27] way but see when it comes down to do it
[57:30] we must receive not just the The Plan of
[57:32] Redemption for the soul right that has
[57:35] been the days gone by that's why God
[57:38] wented the ignorance of man to believe
[57:40] that he would get a new body right cuz
[57:42] he knew there was no way to explain it
[57:44] to mankind right so he has to go forth
[57:47] with a healing campaign to start to the
[57:50] ability to be able to express it MH and
[57:53] then sends a prophets were bring the
[57:55] word
[57:56] to but then his ministry as we covered
[57:59] this morning would start with the
[58:00] opening of the word the opening of the
[58:03] seals and then he had about 3 years
[58:05] Ministry there which was the same way of
[58:08] the Lord
[58:09] Jesus see you go back and compare it but
[58:12] even in the Lord Jesus he only had you
[58:15] know the last 6 months was the the main
[58:18] part cuz that was where he went from
[58:20] Transfiguration to Calvary amen all
[58:23] right and see then we're dealing with
[58:25] the hear ye him of that point to
[58:27] understand the Redemption of the body
[58:29] right who who was speaking of the
[58:32] Redemption of the body right even today
[58:34] after the prophet has brought it where
[58:36] is it out there that they're speaking of
[58:38] the Redemption that's right oh yeah they
[58:41] may be talking about it oh yeah because
[58:43] if you hear something you can talk about
[58:45] it right right but then you go to them
[58:48] and start asking them about it y like I
[58:51] always said you know somebody come up to
[58:53] you and they'll start saying oh yeah boy
[58:55] it's getting bad ain't it the end of the
[58:57] world
[58:58] Ain well you say okay they're fine
[59:01] they're happy they'll go on we talk
[59:03] about the end of the world but all you
[59:05] got to do is just say yeah that's right
[59:06] said man it is bad I don't believe we
[59:09] can be around here very long the way
[59:11] things are going now nobody knows the
[59:14] day or the
[59:16] hour yeah see they don't believe what
[59:19] they're talking about they're just
[59:21] saying what somebody else saying that's
[59:24] right well nobody knows Gainer down now
[59:26] be careful
[59:27] now what did we read there in the
[59:29] scripture since our fathers went to
[59:31] sleep we heard this you remember the
[59:34] scripture we just got to read that's
[59:36] right Peter we've heard these things Y
[59:40] and since our fathers has gone to sleep
[59:41] we've heard these all of our life that
[59:43] this is going to take place you know
[59:45] what brother R said one day about it he
[59:47] said that was the greatest sign that was
[59:49] fixing to
[59:50] take come to
[59:53] pass that they begin to talk about it
[59:55] was going to come had had not come to
[59:58] pass he said that's the greatest sign
[1:00:00] that it was fixed to come to pass so you
[1:00:02] look at it today oh no no no it may be
[1:00:05] 50 years from now I'm 70 one see well
[1:00:10] how long do you think it be well about
[1:00:11] 25 years
[1:00:14] oh that make me somewhere about
[1:00:18] 96 you know in 96 I probably wouldn't
[1:00:20] give a hoop when the world come
[1:00:22] in right amen I probably wouldn't even
[1:00:25] know it even if I was alive that's what
[1:00:29] brother Carol the other day said and I
[1:00:30] thought you know first and he might not
[1:00:32] like me saying this but he's one that
[1:00:33] said it he said somebody said brother
[1:00:35] Carol said you know I think it's close
[1:00:37] to the coming of the Lord don't you he
[1:00:39] said my age 83 I think he is or 86
[1:00:43] something he's right in there he said my
[1:00:44] age it don't make much difference I fix
[1:00:46] to step over one way or the
[1:00:48] other well death is not too bad after
[1:00:51] all is
[1:00:52] it if it going to be around here 20 more
[1:00:55] years somebody better get ready cuz I'm
[1:00:56] going to step home right you either I'll
[1:01:00] be down in the nursing home Ling and
[1:01:03] looking but anyhow listen
[1:01:08] folks you know yourself at what I'm
[1:01:10] trying to say one
[1:01:12] thing outside of this prophet's message
[1:01:14] where was anybody ever speaking that's
[1:01:17] right of the full Redemption of the soul
[1:01:21] to really have an
[1:01:22] understanding grow development adoption
[1:01:27] Etc now everybody's happy we're saved
[1:01:30] we're going to heaven everything you
[1:01:31] know like my brother said this so long
[1:01:33] as I get there Sam I don't care well I
[1:01:36] hope he got there yeah I do
[1:01:41] but but we just what are we doing
[1:01:47] right what are we
[1:01:49] doing the prophet has brought the
[1:01:52] message amen see I keep clicking back to
[1:01:54] that because that was one of them know
[1:01:56] one two three points you're supposed to
[1:01:57] wrote down see I'm not talking
[1:02:01] about right the change of the
[1:02:05] body I'm trying to preach it amen
[1:02:08] right it's been revealed
[1:02:13] right well when are we going to preach
[1:02:15] it okay drop off that said ain't enough
[1:02:18] for you to hold on to what you're
[1:02:19] talking about and not try to figure it
[1:02:22] out just let it go see right I'm not
[1:02:24] looking for something I'm looking at it
[1:02:27] okay cuz that's the way we got to be all
[1:02:30] right now the prophet would say then
[1:02:32] that we would get the complete Plan of
[1:02:34] Redemption that was finished at Calvary
[1:02:37] but see we looked at Calvary as only for
[1:02:39] the soul right but Calvary see there was
[1:02:43] a body hanging on Calvary we'll get back
[1:02:46] to it in a minute that they beat it and
[1:02:48] his blood dropped on the earth to
[1:02:51] cleanse and claim this Earth that's
[1:02:53] right am amen more was taking place at
[1:02:57] Calvary than just well look at him he
[1:02:59] died in my
[1:03:01] place see that's all people want to
[1:03:04] preach he died in my
[1:03:06] place wonderful but that's like brother
[1:03:08] Brown said about Billy Graham he said
[1:03:10] nobody preach salvation like he did to
[1:03:12] get people to repent right but he said
[1:03:15] now what's going to happen right he said
[1:03:17] they float back in and but just go back
[1:03:18] into them denominations and you don't
[1:03:21] float around and don't do no good come
[1:03:22] on now right
[1:03:24] see all right but you
[1:03:28] see we've got to talk about the
[1:03:31] Redemption of the body right right all
[1:03:34] right and to do
[1:03:36] that the prophet in the future home if
[1:03:39] you
[1:03:40] listen he he done to me kind of like uh
[1:03:44] John you remember on patmas one of them
[1:03:46] we
[1:03:47] read John on patas he looks up and he
[1:03:50] sees the city coming down and he
[1:03:53] describes a bride
[1:03:55] you remember that and then another time
[1:03:57] he sees the bride describes the
[1:04:01] city
[1:04:02] right you couldn't tell the difference
[1:04:05] in it that's right so there wouldn't be
[1:04:07] any difference in the Redemption of the
[1:04:09] body
[1:04:11] right see and the Redemption of the
[1:04:14] world because our bodies come out of
[1:04:15] this earth right amen all amen now if I
[1:04:20] can hold a point I'll get back to it in
[1:04:22] a minute wait now we're talking about
[1:04:23] the other tonight and I may repeat this
[1:04:26] again later you know that that Jesus had
[1:04:28] to go to the spirits that were in prison
[1:04:31] right now why does it mention
[1:04:36] right that he only went and talked to
[1:04:38] those who were disobedient in the
[1:04:40] longsuffering in the days of Noah that's
[1:04:46] right it doesn't say that he went and
[1:04:49] preached to the spirits in prison of all
[1:04:52] mankind had been put in prison
[1:04:57] am come on why did he
[1:05:00] say in the days of
[1:05:06] Noah
[1:05:08] right now we'll get to it a minute we'll
[1:05:10] quote
[1:05:12] it you know it yourself your body was
[1:05:14] laying in this earth right abely amen
[1:05:17] right you come out of this Earth sure
[1:05:21] all
[1:05:22] right but do you realize
[1:05:25] that the bodies of those
[1:05:28] people who lived from Adam to
[1:05:33] Noah those bodies were not justified
[1:05:37] that's
[1:05:44] right got quiet a
[1:05:47] you you see I'm trying to say something
[1:05:49] to you
[1:05:53] folks
[1:05:54] come on you tell me he said to those
[1:05:57] that were disobedient y in the
[1:05:59] longsuffering the days of
[1:06:01] Noah but brother R said your body was
[1:06:05] justified into
[1:06:07] flood
[1:06:09] amen see we're not talking about one of
[1:06:12] these days the last two quotes this
[1:06:14] morning I withheld them because I've
[1:06:16] been using them before where brother
[1:06:18] Brown said it's your body's growing
[1:06:20] on it's in the process now
[1:06:24] you see we've stepped ahead of the world
[1:06:27] right in a lot of respect right but
[1:06:30] we'll get down to it in a minute if you
[1:06:32] read the future home you've heard the
[1:06:33] prophet say that your body was justified
[1:06:37] yep when the world was washed amen y
[1:06:41] absolutely in the days of Noah yep
[1:06:45] that's right see so it doesn't say that
[1:06:48] he went and preached to those as a
[1:06:49] witness that had died from where he was
[1:06:52] back to Noah doesn't say that
[1:06:55] right he said well that's just assumable
[1:06:59] okay I'm just making a point
[1:07:02] too see he had to go talk to them
[1:07:06] people cuz they had no
[1:07:09] connection to a bodily
[1:07:14] Redemption because it started in the
[1:07:16] days of
[1:07:18] Noah I hope you read the future home
[1:07:20] over again that's right and notice the
[1:07:24] things the prophet had to say not just
[1:07:27] read the book to where you can raise
[1:07:28] your hand I read it brother Dale right
[1:07:32] like brother dick says he does kind to
[1:07:34] analyze it you
[1:07:36] know I hope he's still doing that and
[1:07:38] older he gets he probably don't analyze
[1:07:40] as much
[1:07:41] but I hope he's still doing
[1:07:44] that see we got some things to get to
[1:07:47] when we get
[1:07:49] there and that's why you got those
[1:07:51] things to take place but let's get get
[1:07:54] back just back back up with me now just
[1:07:56] a little to get a a straightforward
[1:07:59] moving
[1:08:00] point
[1:08:03] see as I said nobody preached the
[1:08:06] Redemption of the
[1:08:08] body and there was nobody preached the
[1:08:11] Redemption of the world it was an
[1:08:13] Annihilation right that even the
[1:08:16] scriptures
[1:08:18] seemingly speaks of
[1:08:22] that cuz in Revelation you see a new
[1:08:25] Heaven and a new Earth new Heavens
[1:08:28] plural Y and Earth singular right right
[1:08:34] now in Peter it seemingly is speaking of
[1:08:38] a total wiping off of the blasting away
[1:08:41] of nuclear and whatever it's the burning
[1:08:43] over you know and even in Isaiah
[1:08:47] 65 he said I
[1:08:50] create a new Heaven and a new Earth
[1:08:55] we so we took all of that even the
[1:08:58] scholars
[1:09:00] Etc and they took those things and
[1:09:04] taught us that we don't know where we're
[1:09:07] going we don't know what's going to take
[1:09:09] place but one of these days wh
[1:09:10] something's going to bang this thing and
[1:09:12] and we're going to go somewhere don't
[1:09:13] worry about it now we're going somewhere
[1:09:16] but we don't know
[1:09:17] where and and we may all be playing
[1:09:19] Hearts so you need to learn how to play
[1:09:21] one while you're here you know cuz you
[1:09:24] may need it when to get tired well you
[1:09:26] musicians will have it on me cuz I can't
[1:09:28] do nothing you know I tell you I get
[1:09:31] static on the radio you
[1:09:33] know but now
[1:09:36] listen when the prophet's message came
[1:09:39] forth he saw the complete Plan of
[1:09:42] Redemption
[1:09:45] right for Body Spirit Soul Man see and
[1:09:52] the world right
[1:09:56] because now if our if we're not going to
[1:09:58] get a new body y right are you
[1:10:01] listening if we're not going to get a
[1:10:03] new body and our body come out of this
[1:10:06] Earth through the process of mama and
[1:10:08] daddy eating you know Etc and genetics
[1:10:11] came and and all of these things comes
[1:10:13] into view and you you come forth and
[1:10:15] your body comes out of this Earth all
[1:10:17] right it don't spun down out of the sky
[1:10:22] now Jesus was created but we we don't
[1:10:24] have that problem I mean that
[1:10:26] ability so
[1:10:28] then if you're going to have not have a
[1:10:32] new body now look what you got to do you
[1:10:34] got to deal with the world right see why
[1:10:38] you you you think that I drag and I do
[1:10:39] too I think oh God I'm just dragging my
[1:10:42] feet and and I get into something and
[1:10:45] then when I do there comes a spot I need
[1:10:47] to explain that yeah see
[1:10:50] right but if we're going to deal with
[1:10:52] the Redemption of the body we're going
[1:10:54] to have to deal with the Redemption of
[1:10:55] the world right cuz our bodies come out
[1:10:58] of the
[1:11:02] earth so it's not just something I I
[1:11:05] want to do it's what I've got to
[1:11:07] do we've got to deal with it and God has
[1:11:11] dealt with it in his
[1:11:12] word right and put it in there for us to
[1:11:16] understand that's right but yet we
[1:11:18] didn't understand it so we had to send
[1:11:20] us a prophet amen that's right to be
[1:11:22] able to tie again together and like I
[1:11:24] said this morning there's those great
[1:11:26] theologians sitting there with all them
[1:11:28] degrees and and brother R say no
[1:11:31] Resurrection no Divine Healing well we
[1:11:33] don't believe that like he believes it
[1:11:36] he just an illiterate old
[1:11:41] Kian but when he stood out there and
[1:11:43] said if I'm I'm not right you come up
[1:11:45] here and straighten me out right amen
[1:11:49] but they didn't get
[1:11:51] up why didn't some of those big hoopty
[1:11:53] doopy guys you know get up and walk up I
[1:11:56] want to show you a lot of them had done
[1:11:59] heard the story about Dr B right yeah
[1:12:03] right that's right when Dr Bess was
[1:12:06] going to challenge the Divine healer
[1:12:09] yeah and brother random wouldn't even
[1:12:11] talk to him brother boser said please
[1:12:13] let me go cuz if you don't said they're
[1:12:16] going to the people you know they need
[1:12:18] something let me go he said if you want
[1:12:20] to argue with him you can
[1:12:22] go and brother Brandon wouldn't let
[1:12:24] brother Bosworth even argue with him
[1:12:27] brother Bosworth just asked him one
[1:12:28] simple question brother brownon sitting
[1:12:30] there he said I never thought of that
[1:12:32] myself brother bosor said I want to ask
[1:12:34] you one simple question said the seven
[1:12:37] compound names of Jehovah do they apply
[1:12:38] to Jesus
[1:12:41] Christ yes or no brother
[1:12:45] best brother R said he knew better to
[1:12:47] answer cuz if he said he was the
[1:12:51] Savior then he would have to to say that
[1:12:54] he was the Healer right the brother Dr
[1:12:58] beess you know brother best there he had
[1:12:59] him tied up brother R said he' done a
[1:13:02] great camelite sermon of Salvation and
[1:13:04] all of these other things but it didn't
[1:13:06] do no good God come down had his picture
[1:13:08] made that's where it's that one that's
[1:13:10] up in Washington DC you know the only
[1:13:12] Supernatural picture has ever been made
[1:13:15] that they've proven that it's right amen
[1:13:18] and when he did see and I checked on
[1:13:21] that and they say it's in the in in what
[1:13:23] it's Missoni in but it's down in the
[1:13:25] basement that you know naturally ain't
[1:13:27] going to let it out very far but it was
[1:13:29] there all right but now
[1:13:32] listen the Lord Jesus surely
[1:13:36] understood the complete Plan of
[1:13:38] Redemption will you go with that right
[1:13:41] all right the Lord Jesus be in the word
[1:13:45] then the word would go with
[1:13:48] that agree the word would have to show
[1:13:51] us the complete plan of
[1:13:54] Redemption which would include the
[1:13:56] Redemption of the
[1:14:00] world but yet as we read
[1:14:02] it see what do we
[1:14:06] get we read the Bible and got a
[1:14:10] Trinity right we read the Bible and got
[1:14:13] hell is being
[1:14:14] Eternal y right we read the Bible and
[1:14:18] decided we can just about do anything
[1:14:20] we're all going to heaven because long
[1:14:21] as I believe
[1:14:26] right
[1:14:28] see but was that what the Bible
[1:14:31] said so the Bible didn't change and
[1:14:33] brother randam didn't have to get a new
[1:14:34] Bible
[1:14:37] right had he started talking about a new
[1:14:39] Bible that we needed I'd have started
[1:14:41] going back to the Baptist
[1:14:45] Church blessing so would I
[1:14:48] today if I found the prophet talking
[1:14:51] about that we got to get a new Bible and
[1:14:52] got to get a new knew this I just turn
[1:14:54] around and go back somewhere and I just
[1:14:55] assume kiss the Pope's toe if I was
[1:14:57] going to leave the word from where I am
[1:14:58] now i' just assume kiss his ring and bow
[1:15:00] down to him as it do to anybody
[1:15:03] else he said oh you're silly no I'm not
[1:15:05] silly I mean every word I
[1:15:07] say my whole life is St upon whether or
[1:15:10] not this message is right cuz if it
[1:15:13] ain't right we got a
[1:15:15] problem but as long as it's in the Bible
[1:15:18] we don't have a problem we just keep
[1:15:21] feasting upon what's in the Bible
[1:15:24] he didn't come to bring us another Bible
[1:15:25] see all right then truly if the Lord
[1:15:28] Jesus understood
[1:15:30] Redemption he would have to put it in
[1:15:33] the
[1:15:35] word are you listening yes see because
[1:15:38] he would have to bring the plan into the
[1:15:41] word see and he did in Matthew 24 right
[1:15:46] see all right the opening of The Seals
[1:15:50] All
[1:15:51] right you ever notice brother around and
[1:15:53] said serpent seed was revealed and seal
[1:15:55] right you know serpent seed was preached
[1:15:56] in
[1:15:59] 58 right go check your dates it's
[1:16:02] preaching 58 brother Brown said it was
[1:16:04] revealed in the seal he said marriage
[1:16:06] and divorce was revealed in the seal he
[1:16:08] said the Rapture was revealed in the
[1:16:09] seal he said thank God for the opening
[1:16:11] of these seals in the last days to
[1:16:13] understand these
[1:16:15] things they might not have been revealed
[1:16:17] to him the day he preached the seals but
[1:16:19] they was in the
[1:16:21] seal I know I Ed preachers in this
[1:16:24] message I know it but after I preached
[1:16:26] in 1983 on the seals and through that 82
[1:16:29] and 83 I said they one of you guys added
[1:16:32] one word to what I've said
[1:16:34] right people don't like that I didn't
[1:16:37] mean they hadn't preached greater things
[1:16:39] and I did I just meant they hadn't added
[1:16:41] one word right I meant what I said and
[1:16:44] said what I meant they hadn't added one
[1:16:45] word to it because in no seals is the
[1:16:48] complete Plan of Redemption amen right
[1:16:51] that's why I said gold Le read the
[1:16:53] titles of the sermons after the seal
[1:16:55] they all go into eternal life did not
[1:16:59] the prophet
[1:17:00] say after the opening of the seals the
[1:17:02] Bible had become what a brand new book
[1:17:07] right you say a different book
[1:17:11] understand he said a brand new
[1:17:14] book I've heard people would hadn't even
[1:17:16] read the seal book and they said boy
[1:17:17] bless God since I come in this message
[1:17:19] the Bible will come a brand new
[1:17:21] book still TR carry into the
[1:17:25] core
[1:17:27] sorry it just folks it just gets on me
[1:17:30] why that there there's one
[1:17:34] message why there's so much
[1:17:36] split over one
[1:17:42] message one Lord Jesus and they wound up
[1:17:44] being thousands of denominations and but
[1:17:48] anyhow see then if if the Lord Jesus
[1:17:51] said it and put it in the word
[1:17:54] then he couldn't leave us with man's
[1:17:56] ideas right he had to send a
[1:18:00] prophet that's right there was no choice
[1:18:03] it wasn't no problem it was no thoughts
[1:18:06] you remember here a while back when I
[1:18:07] was preaching about there was a word for
[1:18:08] each age the word for this age is God
[1:18:10] sent a prophet amen he would be the only
[1:18:14] one who would have the divine
[1:18:16] revelation all right he's gone by the
[1:18:19] grave waiting on you and I amen but he
[1:18:23] went to the Grave with the full
[1:18:24] revelation of God's
[1:18:27] word right he knew the Plan of
[1:18:29] Redemption why preached it to you and I
[1:18:31] right right CU it's in the message
[1:18:35] amen see then truly as I wrote it this
[1:18:37] way the prophet understanding the
[1:18:39] complete Plan of
[1:18:42] Redemption the prophet understanding the
[1:18:45] complete Plan of Redemption he would
[1:18:47] know how that Paul would be speaking of
[1:18:49] mortal coming to immortality Etc
[1:18:52] changing a m in the twinkle of an eye
[1:18:55] right he would know those
[1:18:59] scriptures you couldn't say well Paul
[1:19:02] Paul told us we change one day we CH PR
[1:19:04] like Paul told us
[1:19:07] amen but he didn't tell us how that's
[1:19:12] right that's right I remember reading in
[1:19:15] the Hebrews there and how that the
[1:19:17] Prophet come along one day and he said
[1:19:19] see there and it sounds just exactly
[1:19:21] like you how did the prophet say it said
[1:19:25] he's trying to get out of our minds that
[1:19:26] the Lord's coming right then he said
[1:19:29] Paul was trying to do that trying to get
[1:19:30] out of people's mind well when I read it
[1:19:32] I thought Paul was saying the Lord's
[1:19:33] coming next day yeah right that's what
[1:19:36] you read that's what you thought but
[1:19:39] brother Brown
[1:19:40] said he was trying to get it out of the
[1:19:42] mind of the people that God was coming
[1:19:44] right then said there got to be a
[1:19:45] falling away right and to be a falling
[1:19:47] way you got to be somewhere before you
[1:19:49] can fall and the people of this message
[1:19:51] are the only people that can do that
[1:19:52] kind of fall right amen that's right
[1:19:54] amen we have to have an opportunity to
[1:19:57] believe it y right amen then we can
[1:20:00] fall all right cuz you see we we believ
[1:20:05] that the world was going to be
[1:20:10] destroyed we believe that that these
[1:20:12] bodies would be made we get us a new
[1:20:14] body cuz these old bodies going to be
[1:20:16] going to be destroyed like I said to
[1:20:17] brother preaching and said we'll just
[1:20:19] walk out one of these days over in the
[1:20:20] Millennium and the glorified body all
[1:20:22] over our own body iies you know just
[1:20:23] stomping around uhoh brother colie I
[1:20:26] didn't mean to stump on
[1:20:27] you I'll move over to where Wade's at
[1:20:31] you say silly no it ain't silly that's
[1:20:33] sill what you
[1:20:37] think you see those are popular
[1:20:41] people
[1:20:44] y cuz people don't want to hear the
[1:20:46] truth right I found that out a long time
[1:20:48] ago people don't want to hear the truth
[1:20:51] that's right you tell them that people
[1:20:52] tell tell me I had two certain Brothers
[1:20:54] I always mention they got up one night
[1:20:56] in The Minister's meeting and both of
[1:20:57] them said I want you to tell me like it
[1:20:59] is I don't want you to soft sopic tell
[1:21:01] me like it is I got up behind him I said
[1:21:03] you don't want me to tell you like it is
[1:21:05] I said cuz you couldn't take it and I
[1:21:08] meant them
[1:21:09] too right they couldn't take the truth
[1:21:13] cuz I tried to get it to them and both
[1:21:16] of them turned against me for trying to
[1:21:19] bring the truth to
[1:21:21] them
[1:21:24] you say tell me the truth brother Dale
[1:21:26] that's a good way to lose
[1:21:28] people
[1:21:30] yeah you know if I ever want to get rid
[1:21:33] of brother K I'll just go tell him the
[1:21:36] truth you know why cuz if he ain't got
[1:21:38] the Holy Ghost you know what he's going
[1:21:39] to do he's going to leave and if he's
[1:21:41] got the Holy Ghost he's going to have
[1:21:43] problems right right cuz I'd be the same
[1:21:46] way
[1:21:47] that's cuz the rest of my life the devil
[1:21:50] would be telling me what's he got
[1:21:51] against me what's he got against me
[1:21:52] what's he got against me I'd have to
[1:21:54] fight the whole thing so the best thing
[1:21:56] to do is preach the gospel amen just
[1:21:59] preach the
[1:22:01] gospel and we all pray that God will
[1:22:04] take care of our
[1:22:07] problems don't raise your hand and say
[1:22:10] brother Dale come tell me the
[1:22:15] truth now you know
[1:22:18] better you so we're Christians we can
[1:22:21] take it
[1:22:25] we
[1:22:28] can he said you sure don't have much
[1:22:31] confidence in the Holy Ghost I got a lot
[1:22:32] of confidence in the Holy Ghost I just
[1:22:33] ain't got no confidence in me and
[1:22:35] you is that plain enough yes that's
[1:22:38] don't have nothing to me and you that's
[1:22:40] right sure if you got the Holy Ghost
[1:22:42] you'll line up but it'll be hard that's
[1:22:45] right amen it'll be hard cuz I tried my
[1:22:47] best to tell you the truth
[1:22:50] right and I've lost friends because I
[1:22:53] tried to tell the truth it's a good way
[1:22:55] to lose friends if you want to just go
[1:22:56] tell them the
[1:22:58] truth but now
[1:23:01] listen so the prophet then would be
[1:23:05] given the Plan of
[1:23:07] Redemption as the Lord Jesus had the
[1:23:10] Plan of Redemption you agree right cuz
[1:23:14] not why don't you depend upon him as a
[1:23:15] prophet W you depend on your ideas cuz
[1:23:18] you know what your ideas was you had
[1:23:20] them all messed up that's right see
[1:23:22] that's the way I depend upon the
[1:23:24] prophet's
[1:23:25] message I look at anything and I said
[1:23:28] Lord I thought I understood that yeah
[1:23:30] but now what is it that I don't
[1:23:33] understand he said well go ask the
[1:23:37] prophet so one day I wondered I said
[1:23:40] Lord what is a new
[1:23:43] birth he said go ask the prophet so I
[1:23:45] running into computer and said brother
[1:23:49] brandham what is the new birth or what
[1:23:51] is the Holy Ghost what I believe what is
[1:23:53] the new birth right I S Christ mystery
[1:23:55] God
[1:23:56] reveal he said the revelation of Jesus
[1:23:59] Christ in a new birth personally to
[1:24:03] you you know what I got the right answer
[1:24:06] we was over in South Carina and at a
[1:24:08] meeting and there was a question asked
[1:24:10] and brother colie may have to help me
[1:24:12] even remember the question but there was
[1:24:13] a question asked yeah what was the mark
[1:24:14] that was put on Kan well these
[1:24:17] two well known in the
[1:24:20] message well well no okay in the message
[1:24:24] it was with the prophet both of them
[1:24:26] said he didn't didn't know what it was
[1:24:29] well we start back down the road and
[1:24:31] we're driving down the road and brother
[1:24:32] colleague looks over me
[1:24:35] too you know what I know what the Mark
[1:24:38] was that was put on
[1:24:41] game I said you
[1:24:43] do he said
[1:24:46] yeah it was
[1:24:50] unbelief that's right he said I just
[1:24:54] heard the prophet say that's what it
[1:24:58] was well you know evidently them other
[1:25:01] two guys must not listened a lot you
[1:25:03] know and I hadn't listened enough to
[1:25:05] know what it was so I'm not throwing off
[1:25:07] on them I he said y I don't know what it
[1:25:11] is the brother R said it was unbelief y
[1:25:14] okay all
[1:25:17] right now get the point right God would
[1:25:20] deliver to the prophet
[1:25:24] only after the
[1:25:26] prophet had reached a position of the
[1:25:29] faith of the fathers himself and had
[1:25:32] brought the message of restoring the
[1:25:34] Bible back to where the apostles
[1:25:36] understood because remember now preach
[1:25:38] this to you right that the Lord Jesus
[1:25:41] didn't tell the apostles everything they
[1:25:43] didn't know about the seals and the
[1:25:44] things right they didn't know about son
[1:25:46] of man now you show it to me in the
[1:25:48] Bible you show it to them in brother
[1:25:49] br's message where they understood right
[1:25:52] M now they didn't understand what the
[1:25:54] Lord Jesus said he only opened their
[1:25:57] understanding as to what they could
[1:25:59] handle on the day of
[1:26:01] Pentecost but knowing that he would come
[1:26:03] in the last days right like I say about
[1:26:07] it when he said there in Matthew what is
[1:26:08] it 13:16 or 1613 who did man say I the
[1:26:11] son of man am Peter said Thou Art the
[1:26:14] Christ the son of the Living God he
[1:26:16] never asked him that he asked who the
[1:26:17] son of man was right he said thou the
[1:26:20] Christ the son of the Living God Jesus
[1:26:22] said flesh and blood is not revealed
[1:26:23] that but my father and on my on that
[1:26:25] Revelation right there I'll build my
[1:26:27] church but see he was going to come in
[1:26:28] the end time to explain who the son of
[1:26:30] man
[1:26:32] is but you
[1:26:34] see then we've got to go to the
[1:26:37] prophet's
[1:26:38] message right see to get our
[1:26:41] understanding it's not what I think
[1:26:43] that's right what I think is what I
[1:26:46] thought
[1:26:48] wrong
[1:26:50] right you agree with that yes we had a
[1:26:53] lot of thinking but our thinking was all
[1:26:55] messed
[1:26:56] up the prophet came and brought the
[1:26:58] message well brother there I can show
[1:27:00] you 100 quotes where he says this and
[1:27:02] 100 quotes where he says that which one
[1:27:04] do you want I want both of them because
[1:27:05] it'll tell me something one day when the
[1:27:07] Holy Ghost can reveal
[1:27:09] it or if you got 500 that says one thing
[1:27:12] and one that says something different to
[1:27:14] it hold on God reveal it to you one day
[1:27:17] if you're sincere of what he's really
[1:27:19] saying right amen and you don't have to
[1:27:21] change neither one
[1:27:22] right y right you just go right on down
[1:27:26] the road right man believing him cuz if
[1:27:30] he was the prophet of God he had to
[1:27:32] be Vindicated that's right that's why
[1:27:35] when he was preaching the white horse
[1:27:36] rider like it was he had to be
[1:27:37] straightened out about and there was
[1:27:39] nobody in the world could straighten him
[1:27:42] out he had the lens and all of the
[1:27:45] doctrines and the things he had him but
[1:27:47] that didn't straighten him
[1:27:50] out right even Clarence Lin Tau that the
[1:27:53] White Horse R was the Antichrist Liv
[1:27:56] Clarence Lin was that one I always quote
[1:27:59] I knew I read it many years ago that's
[1:28:01] right cuz he believed that the white
[1:28:02] horse rider was the Antichrist that's
[1:28:04] way before brother brandham that didn't
[1:28:06] straighten brother brandham out it took
[1:28:07] God to come to that Pro amen and show
[1:28:10] him that's right all right but now
[1:28:14] listen amen so then there would there
[1:28:17] won't be any
[1:28:18] difference now watch there won't be any
[1:28:23] different you you you can't have a
[1:28:26] doctrine of like one thing going this
[1:28:28] way and then you got to get something
[1:28:29] else to go this way and something else
[1:28:31] to go around that way it won't work in
[1:28:34] the Bible that's right so whatever the
[1:28:36] doctrine is or the Redemption of the
[1:28:39] soul will have to be applied to these
[1:28:43] bodies
[1:28:45] amen and whatever Redemption of these
[1:28:48] bodies are of the soul will have to be
[1:28:51] applied to the world right Y and that's
[1:28:54] why I've asked you over and over please
[1:28:55] read the future home cuz that's what he
[1:28:57] explained right he said if I don't get
[1:29:00] nothing to you I want to get you the
[1:29:01] Plan of Redemption that's right see now
[1:29:04] let's read a little bit and we a't going
[1:29:06] to get time to go through all of it
[1:29:07] we'll take this up Wednesday and finish
[1:29:09] it cuz we'll get a few of the notes
[1:29:10] anyway look at number three on your
[1:29:12] notes like I said I started to print the
[1:29:14] whole book from page 14 to about
[1:29:17] 23 even more you know of the future home
[1:29:22] cuz I thought a lot of people maybe
[1:29:23] they'll read if I give it to them but I
[1:29:25] decided not they don't read if I give it
[1:29:27] to them cuz no need wasting the
[1:29:30] paper well I already understood I read
[1:29:33] that book 14 years ago we'll try an
[1:29:36] update version okay and an update
[1:29:40] version Don't Change what the prophet
[1:29:42] said the update version is in your mind
[1:29:44] amen amen amen updating of our minds to
[1:29:48] where we can understand right a growth
[1:29:51] velopment in
[1:29:54] Christ we don't need a no updating of
[1:29:57] the Bible updating of our human
[1:30:00] being so look what he said number three
[1:30:02] on your note which is page 14 of the
[1:30:04] future home preach 1964
[1:30:07] 802 and notice how God makes plain to us
[1:30:11] his Plan of
[1:30:12] Redemption oh this just thrilled my soul
[1:30:15] when I saw
[1:30:19] it brother Brandon
[1:30:24] you've been
[1:30:26] preaching from 33 all right to 63 at
[1:30:30] least that's
[1:30:34] right he said this just been revealed to
[1:30:36] me it thrilled my soul when I saw
[1:30:42] it statue of a perfect
[1:30:44] man he said I had these things but said
[1:30:47] this come to me the other day when I was
[1:30:48] down in the woods and there I had a
[1:30:50] shout and Glory Hallelujah time believe
[1:30:53] that
[1:30:54] oh think a lot of people believe that
[1:30:56] brother R knew everything when he came
[1:30:57] well that's not even Jesus didn't do
[1:30:59] that because the Bible City he grow in
[1:31:00] Grace and
[1:31:03] knowledge but now
[1:31:05] listen notice how God makes plain to us
[1:31:09] his Plan of Redemption oh this just
[1:31:11] thrilled my soul when I saw it how he
[1:31:13] makes plain to us here now his Plan of
[1:31:17] Redemption now compare what we see with
[1:31:20] our own eyes that God has
[1:31:23] done done to redeem his world he's done
[1:31:28] the same plan to redeem his people for
[1:31:31] the unchangeable god changes not any of
[1:31:34] his plans or anything such a glorious
[1:31:38] thing so whatever the plan is for the
[1:31:40] soul the plan is for the body whatever
[1:31:43] the plan is for the body is the plan for
[1:31:44] the world okay everybody understand that
[1:31:48] point that'll hold it to where we can
[1:31:50] can keep it going look
[1:31:53] it goes on down cuz where you got the
[1:31:54] line going down your paper it means a
[1:31:56] continuation of reading okay same page
[1:31:59] 14 how he led us to himself to a
[1:32:01] Tabernacle in Us by three stages of
[1:32:03] Grace just like he's led the world in
[1:32:06] three stages to come through the world
[1:32:09] as God will come to the world after it's
[1:32:11] gone through three these three gone
[1:32:13] through three different stages of
[1:32:16] purification that's exactly how he comes
[1:32:18] to us through the three stages of Grace
[1:32:20] I've Ted that at the beginning I've
[1:32:23] never changed it changed since it's
[1:32:25] God's word you know there's people in
[1:32:27] this message now said brother Brown
[1:32:29] change the new birth
[1:32:32] yeah so now brother around said it's
[1:32:34] just the Holy
[1:32:37] Ghost but now according to him there he
[1:32:41] said that he had
[1:32:43] changed well you know what that I tell
[1:32:45] these other people there must be Liars
[1:32:48] here but now look back in his early
[1:32:51] Ministry 1950 10 110 on a Moses
[1:32:54] commission brother Brown says that's in
[1:32:57] the Plan of Redemption you are redeemed
[1:33:00] and when you get to baptism of the Holy
[1:33:01] Spirit that's the earnest of your
[1:33:02] salvation or is that right in other
[1:33:04] words it's a down payment and if it'll
[1:33:07] make us feel like this on a down payment
[1:33:09] what will it do when we get the full
[1:33:11] benefit of it to be it'll be glorious
[1:33:15] War it well then do you believe that
[1:33:18] you'll raise again and have an immortal
[1:33:20] body this is 1950
[1:33:22] how many believes
[1:33:24] that in the in the resurrection and
[1:33:28] you'll raise and have an immortal
[1:33:31] body Divine Healing is the down payment
[1:33:33] or the earnest money of your Immortal
[1:33:36] body see my see what I mean you got to
[1:33:40] have it's the evidence that you'll have
[1:33:42] an immortal body when you
[1:33:45] see even back in the 50s he would speak
[1:33:48] of an immortal
[1:33:50] body
[1:33:52] but go back into early Ministry and find
[1:33:54] him speaking a lot about the Redemption
[1:33:56] of the
[1:33:59] world he may talk about Redemption for
[1:34:02] the
[1:34:03] body he may talk about no Divine Healing
[1:34:06] no
[1:34:07] Resurrection
[1:34:09] right but when the sealed open to that
[1:34:11] prophet he started talking about the
[1:34:13] Plan of Redemption for the
[1:34:16] world cuz he knew then if we wasn't
[1:34:18] going to get a new one we going to have
[1:34:20] to come out of the world
[1:34:22] that's right it comes out of the world
[1:34:25] then it's not going to be annihilated
[1:34:27] like we
[1:34:28] think see we think it's all going to be
[1:34:30] blowned away the Bible says brother Dale
[1:34:33] that heaven and earth will pass away
[1:34:36] well like I said stuff shirt
[1:34:40] Theologian why didn't he look up pass
[1:34:43] away Peter said
[1:34:47] it John said it on patas y
[1:34:53] look around says Daniel saw the
[1:34:56] same said Paul said the same right if
[1:35:00] you read the future
[1:35:02] on but here's them stuff shirts that
[1:35:05] knows all about what them big words
[1:35:07] mean but a prophet had to get in a
[1:35:10] dictionary and look it up and see how to
[1:35:11] find a word and then learn how to spell
[1:35:14] it right it's on down in you
[1:35:16] notes he had to even spell the big old
[1:35:20] word
[1:35:23] see why pass away me passed
[1:35:27] away well and I'm not meaning this wrong
[1:35:30] I mean it in the right form brother Tom
[1:35:32] here the other day passed away right
[1:35:35] that's right but did that annihilate his
[1:35:37] body no no we can go down and dig it up
[1:35:41] it's in a coffin waiting
[1:35:45] right did he pass away as a person on
[1:35:48] the fact of a soul or anything no right
[1:35:51] because we can show that it's beyond the
[1:35:53] curtain of time
[1:35:56] amen so we need to change our thinking
[1:36:02] amen now cat may be cat in English
[1:36:05] language or human
[1:36:08] terms but when you come to biblical form
[1:36:11] sometimes you got to find out some other
[1:36:13] things to understand right it don't
[1:36:17] always mean what we think y
[1:36:22] they were so smart until we don't
[1:36:23] realize it all right so then we start
[1:36:27] into the future home on page
[1:36:30] 13 and what did he say number five when
[1:36:32] you know it's only the atmospheres
[1:36:35] around it and the sin that's upon the
[1:36:37] Earth that will be destroyed
[1:36:42] right okay
[1:36:45] amen
[1:36:46] amen I'm trying to find the other one
[1:36:48] where I could get on down to it but
[1:36:52] we just slowly go down if you don't
[1:36:53] believe that that's what the prophet
[1:36:55] said then you listen to the next message
[1:36:57] let's see if I can find it where used
[1:36:59] the big old word spelled it out 17 17
[1:37:05] number seven 1 17 okay I'm glad I put
[1:37:09] numbers on there where you keep up with
[1:37:12] it yeah number 17 he covers it and
[1:37:17] that's page 27 of the future home he
[1:37:19] covers the big word and spelled p a r e
[1:37:22] r e c h o m i a which does not mean
[1:37:26] annihilated it means to change from one
[1:37:28] form to
[1:37:31] another all right you know that when you
[1:37:34] receive the new birth according to Paul
[1:37:35] in Corinthians you become a what new
[1:37:39] creature a new creation did you pass
[1:37:46] away you know did you just annihilate it
[1:37:49] you went down to the altar you know you
[1:37:51] got down praying and you just
[1:37:53] disappeared right you re see the Holy
[1:37:56] Ghost just he just gone because that's
[1:37:59] the same word y brother Bram gives it to
[1:38:03] you and after you read it where Jesus
[1:38:04] said loose the cat and tell him to bring
[1:38:06] it he said it's the same word that's
[1:38:09] right he said when Lazarus was dead if
[1:38:11] you read the future home you've heard
[1:38:13] the that when Lazarus was there in the
[1:38:16] grave it said loose him and bring him
[1:38:17] out and take the bra the grave clothes
[1:38:19] off of him loose
[1:38:23] but you see we've all thought that
[1:38:25] everything would be
[1:38:29] annihilated we don't know what kind of
[1:38:31] thing going to take place what's going
[1:38:32] to be but this whole thing just
[1:38:34] annihilated it's
[1:38:38] destroyed the prophet said only the
[1:38:41] atmosphere is around it and the sin
[1:38:44] that's upon the Earth will be
[1:38:48] destroyed all right and you're going to
[1:38:50] have to Wednesday for the read the
[1:38:52] future home so if you hadn't read it
[1:38:55] that'll give you an opportunity to
[1:38:56] either read or listen to the
[1:38:58] tape cuz these these bodies are not
[1:39:01] going to be
[1:39:03] destroyed you can burn me up right but
[1:39:06] I'll turn back to
[1:39:08] gases and gases is where I came from in
[1:39:11] the
[1:39:15] beginning
[1:39:17] that's see we believe in Redemption yes
[1:39:20] sir amen the soul wasn't destroyed by
[1:39:24] the new
[1:39:30] birth it was just washed right
[1:39:34] Justified cleansed
[1:39:36] Sanctified and got to baptism of the
[1:39:39] Holy Ghost and Fire to burn out anything
[1:39:42] that was left in
[1:39:43] us with the Holy Ghost to come and live
[1:39:46] in us right that's the new
[1:39:50] birth
[1:39:51] brother said it wasn't your soul that
[1:39:53] died he said it was the nature of your
[1:39:57] soul not your soul no right the new
[1:40:01] birth
[1:40:03] right the Plan of Redemption same for
[1:40:06] body same for soul same for
[1:40:10] world all
[1:40:12] right see let's read a couple right here
[1:40:15] before we finish this
[1:40:16] get get your H page number six which is
[1:40:21] on page 13 He says and all this exists
[1:40:24] in the heavens or atmospheres in the
[1:40:26] earth which is now this Earth holds
[1:40:28] those things but it wasn't made for that
[1:40:31] purpose you know they've traveled to the
[1:40:33] Moon see as far as man goes he got to be
[1:40:36] cleaned one day as far down as we go and
[1:40:40] there's Wells that are thousands of feet
[1:40:42] deep right and as far as man goes that
[1:40:45] way it's got to be cleansed
[1:40:48] y you said well how can that be
[1:40:51] that mean the world wouldn't be no
[1:40:52] bigger than a
[1:40:56] basketball you just remember when the
[1:40:58] flood took place it sure shifted this
[1:41:01] stuff around right it did that's right
[1:41:04] amen but just remember over in the Book
[1:41:06] of Revelations you don't have to worry
[1:41:08] about it now it's not going to do away
[1:41:10] with the water but it's going to do away
[1:41:12] with the sea because there's no more Sea
[1:41:15] called water is
[1:41:17] H2O two parts hydrogen one part oxygen
[1:41:21] the greatest explosive situation that
[1:41:24] can
[1:41:25] be y that's why they were afraid to set
[1:41:29] off the first or split the first atom
[1:41:32] because they were afraid it would start
[1:41:33] a chain
[1:41:35] reaction and probably if they hit it
[1:41:37] correctly according to science they did
[1:41:39] not split the atom at perfectly dead
[1:41:41] center they missed it just a little
[1:41:43] probably if it hit it dead center it
[1:41:44] would have blow the whole
[1:41:47] world you see they only got what God
[1:41:49] wanted them to have right that's right
[1:41:52] right that's it so what did he
[1:41:55] say and all our bodies that we live in
[1:41:58] now was put on the earth when God
[1:42:00] created it because you're out of the
[1:42:02] Dust of the earth
[1:42:04] am okay the Plan of Redemption let's get
[1:42:08] the next one and we'll
[1:42:09] quit it refers to three stages of the
[1:42:13] earth Peter said
[1:42:16] this it refers to the present world we
[1:42:19] live in now called it a world the old
[1:42:22] world that stood out of the water and
[1:42:25] the world that is to
[1:42:26] come three stages we'll pick up right
[1:42:30] there Weds to the Lord but you go home
[1:42:32] and you think about
[1:42:34] it this
[1:42:36] world it already went
[1:42:39] through
[1:42:41] justification right and sanctification
[1:42:45] right and just
[1:42:49] remember our bodies were in the world
[1:42:52] when Noah right and the
[1:42:56] blood our bodies were in the world when
[1:42:59] Jesus blood dropped on it
[1:43:06] right so we're already in the
[1:43:10] process because when God gave you the
[1:43:13] Holy Ghost and you're not going to get
[1:43:15] you a new body right if you believe that
[1:43:17] by now that it settled you ain't going
[1:43:19] to get a new body take this point when
[1:43:22] God put the baptism of the Holy Ghost in
[1:43:24] you he cleanse and claim that body
[1:43:28] you're living
[1:43:30] in you're not going to get another
[1:43:34] one he laid claim on it right there
[1:43:39] amen you say yeah but look how bad it
[1:43:42] is look what we used to be look what the
[1:43:46] world used to be
[1:43:49] right that's right but what about the
[1:43:52] Plan of
[1:43:55] Redemption that's right you might want
[1:43:58] to consider some things and think about
[1:44:00] it
[1:44:04] see that we need to know the Plan of
[1:44:08] Redemption amen
[1:44:11] right amen we need to know it for the
[1:44:13] body amen we need to know it for the
[1:44:16] world Amen we need to know it for all
[1:44:18] these things the prophet said the ACT
[1:44:20] atmosphere in other words wherever man
[1:44:22] has been to pollute it is going to have
[1:44:25] to be cleansed as deep as he's went in
[1:44:28] it's going to have to be cleansed y
[1:44:32] because he's laid it on there and made a
[1:44:34] mark out of it right and you see if we
[1:44:37] don't believe in a worldly
[1:44:42] Redemption why wouldn't Jesus accept
[1:44:44] what Satan
[1:44:48] said in his temptation
[1:44:51] right he said all of these things and
[1:44:54] brother randam said he showed him all
[1:44:56] Russia and all said he showed him United
[1:44:59] States that's what he said
[1:45:02] yeah Satan showed it to the Lord Jesus
[1:45:06] and said I'll give it to
[1:45:10] you Jesus said won't do it got to pay
[1:45:13] the
[1:45:15] price same thing as Abraham when Abraham
[1:45:18] was coming down through there and his
[1:45:19] wife died
[1:45:22] he said I need a place to bury my
[1:45:24] wife man was real nice to him he said
[1:45:27] I'll give it to
[1:45:28] you he said
[1:45:30] no boy that's a slap in the face a the
[1:45:33] man offers you a burial plot you turn
[1:45:36] around and say I ain't going to do it
[1:45:37] I'm going to pay for her well why you
[1:45:40] want to be so
[1:45:43] stubborn Abraham said I want to pay for
[1:45:47] it see he didn't know what he was doing
[1:45:50] but the Lord Jesus knew what he was
[1:45:52] doing when he said
[1:45:55] Satan I'm going to buy
[1:45:58] it because brother R said he knew that
[1:46:00] Satan would have an ear mark on the
[1:46:03] world
[1:46:05] y that he could still deal with you and
[1:46:10] control you if he had an ear mark on
[1:46:13] you he said well sin has no I thought we
[1:46:16] were supposed to be dead
[1:46:19] right Can't Be Your Mark
[1:46:22] right Jesus Paid the price am Abraham
[1:46:26] bought the burial plot
[1:46:28] y wouldn't let him give it to
[1:46:31] him typ in Christ to come to Calvary to
[1:46:34] die for you and I he didn't have to do
[1:46:37] that and if we're going to get a new
[1:46:39] body why did he have to worry about
[1:46:40] getting beat up and killed in this kind
[1:46:42] of a body come on Amen all he had to do
[1:46:45] was just back up to heaven and say come
[1:46:47] on y'all follow me mhm y right
[1:46:51] mhm he had to go through all that
[1:46:53] horrible thing because there was going
[1:46:54] to be a Redemption of the body let's
[1:46:56] stand come on brother thank on these
[1:47:01] things think on these
[1:47:04] things the same plan for the world is
[1:47:06] the same plan for the body the same plan
[1:47:08] for the body is the same plan for the
[1:47:19] soul The Plan of
[1:47:22] Redemption what do you think about
[1:47:25] it Jesus said I am the
[1:47:29] resurrection he said he that believeth
[1:47:31] in me shall never die believest thou
[1:47:35] this somebody's not going to have to
[1:47:39] die CU Jesus said
[1:47:42] it Paul said
[1:47:46] it Jesus said
[1:47:48] it brother randam said that's enough to
[1:47:51] be three Witnesses right that's right
[1:47:53] think on these things what we got let's
