========================================
All my night [music] was turned [singing] to day and all my burdens away. Now the comforter abides with [music] me. [singing] Oh he abides. He abides. Hallelujah. He abides [singing] with me.

It's uh I remember the first time I heard this song was down [music] at um brother Stan St stands in um Navar, Florida. And it was just a wonderful &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; uh song that spoke with me. And I I've been going through the Holy Ghost series. It's one of my favorite series that Brother Bram preached [music] I think in 59. And he talks about that that spirit of [music] truth, that comforter that is with us, that advocate. And wherever he said, "Wherever I am, you're going to be." That's the promise. [snorts] And wherever you go, just remember, [music] even if you feel alone, you're not alone. He's there. [music] And every time you go up the high and the lows of life, he's there. Amen. Everywhere I go on this road, [singing and music] high and low, where I go, I go, Lord, with you.

I'm so glad we don't have to walk that road alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know, we're walking this journey also with each other cuz we're family and that's what family does. We're [music] there for each other. But it's the spirit that's in us that keeps us. It's the spirit that in us that guides us. &gt;&gt; And if you're family, and I believe you are, can you [music] just turn to your brother and sister and greet him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ? And let's just sing that once more as our brother Donnie comes for responsive reading. Everywhere I go on this road, high and low, where I go, I go with you. And I won't be [music and singing] afraid. This my go. Where I go, I go with you. Where I go, [singing and music] I go with you. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; You love it. All these smiling faces out here this morning. It's good to be here this morning. Well, cold and brisky makes you feel chilly when you go outside. Step a little peppery that cold moist ground. We're going to be reading from John this morning. U John 14 1-15. And let's just thank him before we go to his word this morning. Precious heavenly father, we thank you for this day you've come together around your word one more time, Lord. And we ask you just come down and bless us, Father. And most of all, come down, Father, and reveal your word to us, Lord. We need it more than anything. And we thank you today for just being here and all the ones that can make it through the door. But Lord, bless those that couldn't make it through the door today. Just be with them and you know their needs and touch them and bless them. And Father, we ask that those ones still out there in the desert, Lord, you know who [snorts] they are. Your word says it. And I'll say it again. We'll be there with our offspring and ask you, Lord, to bring them in. Whatever it takes. We ask, Father God, today that you just be with Brother Wade and bless him on his journey, Lord, and bring him home safely. And most of all, let the little people up there in Tennessee be blessed by what he brings today. And we ask you today also bless brother Louu. Bless him Lord. Let him speak those words you placed on his heart and stare his heart. Lord Louis is a precious brother. Lord everywhere he goes. He's talking about you, Lord. And that's what we all need to be doing is preaching your word, Lord, and becoming your word. And ask you just to be with brother Luis now as he's coming today. And ask now, Father, that as the word comes forth, you just come down and be with us and bless the service today, Lord. And we ask these precious things in your name, Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; John 14, [crying] let not your heart be troubled. You believe in God, believe also in me. If it were not soare, [crying] &gt;&gt; and if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself, that where I am, there ye may be also. &gt;&gt; I go, you know, and the way you know. Thomas saith unto him,"Lord, we know not whether thou goest, and how can we know the way?" &gt;&gt; Jesus said unto him, "I am the way, truth, and life. No man cometh unto the Father by me." &gt;&gt; If ye had known me, ye should have known my father also. And from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him. &gt;&gt; Amen. to him, Lord, show us the Father and &gt;&gt; Jesus said unto him, Have I been so long with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philillip? He that has seen me has seen the Father. And how sayest thou then, show us the Father? &gt;&gt; Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me. The words that I speak unto you, I speak not of myself, but the father that dwelleth in meths. &gt;&gt; Believe me that I am in the father and the father in me. Or else believe me for the very work's sake. verily I say unto you that believeth on mess that I do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because I go unto my father &gt;&gt; and whosoever ye shall ask in my name or whatsoever I'm sorry ye shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son &gt;&gt; if you shall ask anything in my name I will do &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; If you love me, keep my commandments. Thank you for the reading of the word. You may be seated. Amen. You know, if there's any verse I would encourage you to remember by what brother Donnie read is verse three. If I go and prepare a place, I'll prepare prepare a place for you and I'll come again to receive you unto myself. &gt;&gt; You know, we have our places, we have our homes here, but when you come to the end of life, you kind of wonder what's on the next side. There's a place he said he prepares for us. There's a lot of believers that have went on. They're at that place waiting on us. [snorts] What a promise. &gt;&gt; Some There's so many people in this world that don't have that assurance, &gt;&gt; but we have that assurance. And I tell you, that makes me happy to know that my Lord has prepared a place for me. &gt;&gt; No matter how rich you are, how poor you are, there's a place there for you. &gt;&gt; And I thank God for that this morning. Amen. Brother, would you come and take up the offering for us? Amen. Yes. Just um also remember that the fellowship meeting is next Saturday um January 17th. Brother Daryl Ward will be with us. Starts at 3:00 in the evening. So come and worship and just be a part of the [snorts] gathering. Um you know there just something about fellowship. Um, just a personal little testimony. When I was younger, I didn't like to be around people. I was an introvert and I just didn't want to be around people. It's just something that was in my personality. But there's just something about the spirit of God that kind of breaks that. And you kind of grow into this. They're not just people. They're a part of a body. They're a family. And um, you know, I'm sure there's some natural family members people don't like to be around. But when you get in the spirit of God, you just don't see each other's faults. you just appreciate people being there &gt;&gt; because we had a prophet that said, "We got a future home we're going to." So, come and fellowship, be a part of something bigger than just your home. Cuz God can use you. He really can if you let him. And uh I've learned that. And so, it's just part of surrendering. Amen. It's part of giving our life away to him. And that's what we're going to sing here &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; uh before our brother comes in [music] a little while. Amen. No earthly price could [singing] be too great. No sacrifice too much [singing and music] to make. No way of measure in the cross next to the blood of [singing] Calary's cross. So if I live, I live for him. [music] or if I die, I count it gain. My life is not my [singing] own, but his from this day on. [music] And now I'm [singing] giving my life away, [music] laying [singing] it down on the altar. Now I'm giving my life away. [music] The very least [singing] I can offer is my [singing] own. [music] So here I [singing] stand today giving my life away. [music] And I've seen [singing] a vision heart since we one who gave all he had for [music and singing] me. I've seen the passion of his death and [music] the forgiveness in his final breath. Now I can never be [singing] the same. My heart has been forever. You [music] changed. And I've got to live and love and [singing] give because he gave. [music] And now I'm giving my life away. [music] I'm &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; laying it down on the altar. Now I'm giving [music and singing] my life away. The very least [singing and music] I can over is my own. [singing] So here I stand today giving my life away. Let's sing that first verse. [music] Oh, no earthly price could be too great. No [music] sacrifice too much [singing] to make. No way of measureing the cost next to the [singing] blood of Calary's cross. So if I live, I live [singing] for him. or if I die, [music] I count [singing] it gain. My life is not my own, but his from Oh, do you just want to surrender to him this morning? Oh, now I'm giving [music] my life. I'm laying it down on [singing] the altar. Now I'm giving my life away. The very [singing] least [music] I can offer is my own. [singing] [music] So here I stand today giving my life. Oh just raise your hands and surrender to him. Oh, now I'm giving my life away. I'm laying it down on [music and singing] the altar. Giving my life away. [singing] [music] The very least I can offer is my [singing] own. So here I stand today, giving my [singing] life away. Oh, now I'm giving [music] my life away. I'm laying it down [singing and music] on the altar. Now I'm giving my life [music] away. The very least [music and singing] I can offer is my all is my all. So [music] here I stand today giving my life away. [music] Hallelujah. Amen. [applause] just sing that and cry out your name. Amen. Praise the Lord. [snorts] It's all about sacrifice. Amen. I hope you come this morning to give up a part of yourself. Lay it on the altar of God. Let's just sing out. We cry out your name before brother Louise comes out this [music] morning.

You excuse me while try to fix get all these things taken care of. All right. All right. Praise the Lord. Hopefully that comes up. Amen. Well, God bless you all. It's good to be in the house of the Lord. I trust that uh everyone has uh had a good week and uh it's good to be back. Hopefully uh everybody's ready to face another year. We don't know what God has in store, but definitely uh we're relying on him. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not up to us to worry about what's going to happen. It's up to us to rely on what he already said in his word. &gt;&gt; Amen.

Amen. &gt;&gt; And you're the one who prepares. The bride is the one who who dressed herself in the word. Amen. So all these things and all these signs and all these different things that we're seeing, it's all just pointing us to keep getting ready. Keep getting ready. Keep putting more of the word on. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. Um we appreciate all your prayers as we were out and uh traveling and it's good to be back where it's a little warmer. Uh, and we're not shoveling snow. Uh, if if you didn't know, when we were in Canada visiting my wife's family there for for the holidays and, uh, when we were going in, it was snowing and snowstorms. We went through two snowstorms coming through and then when we were leaving Canada, it was snowing. But, uh, I tell you what, shoveling snow is a wonderful exercise, man. And I had to shovel snow a couple of times and it it really helps. I felt it felt really good afterwards. I mean, you're you're breathing hard breathing hard. But um I can see why people up there want to come down to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, the Canadians during the winter time. But it was good to be with my wife's family. Haven't spent the holidays with him in in a few years. And it was really good to do that. And so, uh, appreciate the Lord also bringing my my daughter back, Bella, back safely from Europe. Uh, she had a good time there at the meetings that they had and got to travel around in different places that that even my wife and I haven't been to. So, appreciate the Lord bringing her back safely. Before we go to the word, just remind uh and I know these have already been mentioned, but next weekend of course is the is the uh fellowship meeting uh January 17th. So you, as brother Joe said, you're definitely welcome to come be here. It's at 3 p.m. And brother Daryl Ward, he's going to be ministering for us. And usually we always get re get a blessing when brother Daryl Ward comes around. &gt;&gt; So uh I encourage you all to to come and and listen to the word and just fellowship. And uh also today is the last day for the sisters to sign up for the foods that we'll bring for the fellowship meeting uh next Saturday. Okay. So, sisters, please use the signup sheet on the refrigerator downstairs to list your name and the food you will bring. Amen. And of course, also still more than a month away, the church Valentine banquet will be held on Saturday, February 21. So, there will be a signup sheet for that as well down there downstairs. Amen. Praise the Lord. I also want to thank each and every one of you all for praying for my for my uncle Hugo. And I know that some of you all have uh asked about um about his condition and about where he's currently at. I believe God has has been answering prayer. He's slowly waking back up. But uh what what he has is is called chronic destructive pulmonary disease. which is uh it's in the group of lung diseases uh which includes emphyma and chronic bronchitis. His heart has been affected as well for for the past several years. He used to be a heavy smoker and um and usually a form of this is what happens to heavy smokers. He was also a an alcoholic as well. and uh my my mom, she told me to tell you all to personally thank you very much because that's her brother and she really thanks the prayers of the saints and I believe God is answering prayer. I told my mom I said mom the other day I said mom don't worry about it try not to you know because you know my mom she's the oldest of all the siblings and he's the second and of course she's about two years older. I said, "We don't want you to get sick just because you're trying you're wearing, right?" But she I told her, I said, "If anything happens, let the Lord's will be done." I said, "But if whatever happens, you you you don't you don't have to be regretful because about two or three years ago, she was the one who was instrumental to leading him to the Lord. Even while she was here, she's always in communication with them. and she led him to the Lord and he got baptized last year as well. And ever since that he's been he's been a just a man of faith, a man of faith. And he keeps con confiding and and and confessing that he the [snorts] Lord is going to heal him. The Lord is going to heal him. &gt;&gt; And and he's had several times already he goes to the he goes to the hospital for it seems like he's going and then he gets better, comes back. He has a an infection in his stomach, goes to the hospital, and just different things, multiple things that have happened to him in the last several years. But he just keeps confessing the word, confessing the word, confessing his healing, confessing his healing. And I tell you what, it's an encouragement to me because um you know, he's only he's only a baby in Christ. And then sometimes some of us who've been in the Christian walk a long time, we have a hard time confessing God's promised. And he encourages me. He encourages my mom. He encourages. So it's amazing what God through trials and things and problems, the way he turns things around to use those people to speak to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I encourage you all to just please continue to pray for my uncle Hugo that the Lord would just um raise him up if it be his perfect will and that the medicines that they're having to give him right now won't affect his kidneys because that that's what they're they're they're they're concerned about. Uh, of course, if that affects his kidneys, then he'll have to have dialysis and things like that and we don't want that. So, but so we just appreciate your prayers. Also, just continue to pray for brother Wade this morning as he's ministering there in Tennessee. All right, let's just go. How many are ready for the word? &gt;&gt; Amen. So, let's uh read this scripture here and I'll have you be seated in Psalms chapter 51:12. This morning, I I I want to give a New Year's uh message. And uh even though we're already 11 days in, but it's still New Year's. Amen. It's still It's still, you know, time just goes by so fast, but but here we are in 2026. I know a lot of us never imagined that we'd be here in 2026, but here we are. Amen. The Lord says here in Psalms 51, it says, "Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit." Of course, this is David speaking when he was repenting. In Lamentations 5:21, this is the New Living Translation. It says, "Restore us, O Lord, and bring us back to you again, man. Give us back the joys we once had." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Isaiah 40:31 says, "But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. They shall mount up with wings as eagles. They shall run and not be weary, and they shall walk and not faint." &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. I want to talk this morning. It's not mysteries and it's not thunders and and and and seals, but I believe this is just as foundational and as as as as as deep and some of we have different people with different walks of life, &gt;&gt; but I believe we serve a God of new beginnings. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believe that this morning? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. Let's just bow our heads this morning. Heavenly Father, we come before you once again, Lord, knowing that you are the God of new beginnings. Father, you, heavenly father, are such a graceful, gracious God, full of mercy, Lord God, and slow to anger. And Lord, we just appreciate, Lord, the grace and the mercy that you have bestowed upon us, Lord, throughout our lives, Lord God. We wouldn't be where we are now, Father God, if it wasn't for you, Lord, bringing us through. And we pray now that you would just forgive us for our sins. Place anything that would hinder the service, Lord, under the blood of Jesus Christ this morning. May heavenly father just have your way. Use my lips to say something that would benefit your people, Lord God, and that would bring you glory, Lord Jesus. And Father God, hinder me from saying anything that I shouldn't, Lord God, that would not bring you glory and that would hinder your people, Lord Jesus. Grant it, Lord God. We just commit ourselves now to you. Continue to be with brother Wade, Sister June, as they travel. Protect them. Bring them back home safely, Lord God Almighty. And Lord, we we just commit the service into your hands and all the needs, Father God, that are represented here, Lord Jesus, into your hands now. We ask, we pray and ask these things in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. Praise the Lord. Amen. This morning, we just want to kind of do it in a form of a in a form of a Sunday school, but we'll see how the Lord leads. Amen. And uh um I just pray that you'd be blessed. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I want to start with this slide right here. I know this has success, but I found this and I thought it was very interesting. Sometimes our our Christian walk is kind of like we think that it's it's the it's the straight line that when we start serving God that it's going to be just fine and dandy, the straight line and then and then what people think it really is looks like it's it's the second one, the middle one. It's all curvy and it's all it's all but in reality it's the last one. [laughter] How many can say that? It's it's sometimes you're up, you're sometimes you're down. Sometimes it's it's you're you're you're happy and you're and you're and you're moving. Oh, I'm moving forward. This is the year where I'm and but then something happens and you're back again and then oh and then and and this is how it is. &gt;&gt; I mean, I hope that I'm not the only one. &gt;&gt; Just because I'm a preacher, you know that that you know, doesn't mean that it doesn't happen to to us. It happens to us a lot. Espec As a matter of fact, The devil attacks preachers more than anybody else. And so, um, uh, that's the reality. But I'm so glad that in the middle of all that, Amen. God knows the way. God knows the way. And now I have this this little like a five six second clip and it's in it the the the the meme it's a little meme but but but it it says it says it in Spanish and I'll just I'll pause it here for you and translate it for you. Hopefully it plays. Now it says here this is when God when I show God my plans. The man on the right is you. the the the man the older man on the left is is is is is God, right? And then the man on the right, which is you, he's holding and wielding a sword in front of the man in front of front of the old man. And this is what happens. This is me, God, showing God my plans. And then look what God does. He don't care about your plans. &gt;&gt; It's nothing to him. So whatever plans you had for this year, you [laughter] hey, you better make sure it's with the word, &gt;&gt; whether it's business related or whether what school, whatever your friends, how whatever you're going to do. Amen. Make sure it's guided by the word. &gt;&gt; Because to God, he'll allow you to come through whatever you want to do. He'll he'll allow permissive will into your life, but eventually it will come to his perfect will. &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Joe and I, we were talking back there how how when when the Lord uh when brother with brother Brandham back in the 50s and and brother Brandham was when he was supposed to go to uh Durban, South Africa, I believe, and he he he didn't he didn't go or or or something on the lines where he wasn't supposed to go or but he wasn't there and he took a a a a detour and went through Portugal and you can go back in the message and read that and how God even though he was out of the will of God. I told brother Joe that I don't think that brother Brandham would have even had visited Portugal if if he had not if he had not if he had disobey if he had not disobeyed God at that moment. And so it's amazing. And in Portugal the the you can read there in the message how God used he said brother Ram said he had some of the best meetings that he has ever had in Portugal. And there's people there in the message right now serving the Lord. So God can take whatever plan you have, anything in your life, Amen. And use it for his perfect will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. Now, so we're talking about a God, the God of new beginnings. Amen. How many believe that God is gives is is is a God of many chances? &gt;&gt; I I hope we serve a God of many chances &gt;&gt; because if not, Amen. we're we're we're condemned. We're doomed. Amen. But many Christians uh especially younger Christians, they live their life as follows. They feel an urgency, amen, to serve God. I I got to write, I got to make my life right. So what they do is they repent. They know they have to repent. Then they do well for a while. Then they start drifting again. And then they feel guilty again. And then that urgency comes back again. And then and so on and so on. And and and it's a cycle. It's a it's a roller coaster. Right. &gt;&gt; It's a roller coaster ride and God does not want us to have a roller coaster Christian life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I mean, we know that that that that not because of something that you've done. We know that God allows tri trials, tribulations, and problems that will cause our lives to go up and down, up and down, but we're we're staying intact in the cart. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. But sometimes we allow roller coaster life in our life because of because of us. We're the ones who who who who make the Christian life difficult for ourselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. God doesn't make it difficult. If you stay hidden behind his word, Amen. It's He said, "My my burdens are easy and my my burden is light." Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you've placed everything upon him, Amen. It should be simple. The problem is is that we like to pick up the burdens again and think that we can do it again on our own. That there's something that you got to do. But in reality, amen, God has already ba did the work for you. Praise God. All you got to do is place put put his uh uh uh put his trust put your trust in his word. So this constant cycle, it makes you feel like you're a fake and not a true Christian. &gt;&gt; Amen. I've been there, done that, man. Makes you feel make makes you feel like like you're not even worthy. So why would why would God if I've failed him once, why would God accept me again? But you'd be surprised. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. You'd be surprised because we serve a God that that is more gracious than what we think he is. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I want you to understand that this this morning that the spirit spiritual struggle does not mean that the Holy Spirit is not working in your life. All right, let me repeat that again. Spiritual struggle does not mean that the Holy Spirit is not working in your life. If the Holy Spirit was measured by how much of a flawless life you have, then no one would have him. But it's not about how much flawlessness you have or how little you you you make mistakes. Amen. It's about what he has already done for you to make sure that he's taken care of your mistakes. Amen. When you confess to him. Praise God. &gt;&gt; And the problem is is that we don't h we're not we are not humble enough and and and it really it comes down to unbelief in his word. Yeah. &gt;&gt; We don't believe enough that his power, Amen, to restore us is sufficient for our lives. &gt;&gt; And so what happens is we get caught up in these cycles up and down, up and down. I do wrong and then I repent. I do wrong again. I repent up and down. I'm not sure if he's going to take me in. He is ready and willing. Amen. With a merciful hand to take anybody in who who who repents from their heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not repenting because your parents are watching you. Not repenting because the pastor might say something about you. But repenting because you know that you have failed him. But you want to come back to his fold and he has his o arms ready open for you. &gt;&gt; I mean his arms were open for you. Amen. On the cross of Calvary. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He wasn't like this. He wasn't crucified like this. He was crucified like this. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. So Paul says in Romans chapter 7 and verse 19, he says, "For the good that I would, I do not, but the evil which I would not, that I do." And this is this this wasn't an unbeliever speaking this. And it it was an apostle, a prophet a and the Ephesus church age messenger who was who was saying this. E even Paul was struggling with the law of sin that dwelt in him. Amen. Even Paul was tempted. Amen. Even Jesus was tempted. Praise God. But without sin. Amen. We make mistakes. We may fail him. Amen. But if if we didn't, then Jesus then Jesus what Jesus did for us, Amen. would have been in vain. &gt;&gt; Right. He He knew that he was going to come and die for imperfect people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if you're perfect, then there was no purpose for him to come and die for you. But because you're not perfect, Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then he had a reason to come and for you. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; So if you if you go back and read in in Romans chapter 7, and I encourage you to go back and just read that whole chapter, read chapter 6, 7, and then 8. And Paul is explaining here the inner conflict inside someone who knows God's law but still struggles in their Christian walk. And he he explains that the problem is not God's law, which is good and holy, but the sinful nature that remains in you. Amen. God. It's not the problem is not with the word. The problem is with you &gt;&gt; because you don't believe the word enough. Amen. To think that God can take care of your sin. That God can take care of your problem. You know saints or as the more you live this life, the more you realize how dependent you are on God. &gt;&gt; Amen. the more you you the more you realize that that that when God has truly done something in your life, you're going to have that black dog and that white dog fighting inside of you. &gt;&gt; Remember that brother Brandham talked about that. All right? And if you don't have that fight within you, if you don't have that struggle within you, then I'm afraid God has not done something in you. But as long as you have that fight, amen, inside of you, when even if you fail, but you know, amen, beyond the shadow of doubt, that God's word is true, and you know that even if you fail, you can go back to the word and the word restores you. Amen. Praise God. Then that gives you strength. Amen. To continue fighting in that fight. Remember, brother Brandon preached that message, the battle is in the mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is Satan's battleground, but this is all God's al battleground as well. See, it's like a tugofwar, saints. Amen. A tugof-war where where where Satan, he's pulling and God is also pulling and you're in the middle. Amen. But we know at the end is God is the victor. Amen. And and if you know in a in a game of tugof-war, Amen. only one side can win. &gt;&gt; There can be no two winners in a tugof war. only one side can win. And and and whoever wins is takes the whole rope [laughter] &gt;&gt; and you're in the middle. And we know at the end of the book, Amen. God ends up winning. And if you're tied to him, Amen. You're a winner with God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; So, you're caught in a tug of war. Amen. Satan is after your soul, but so is God. &gt;&gt; But God is the one who created you. Satan did not create you &gt;&gt; because Satan is not a creator. &gt;&gt; And I'm so thankful for that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Praise the Lord Jesus. Amen. So, so is Paul saying here, since sin lives in me, I might as well give into give into it every time. Is that what Paul says in in in in in in Romans chapter 7? And of course, the answer is no. He is only explaining why sin happens, not excusing it or saying it's all right to surrender to it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he clearly he he makes this uh clear in the previous chapter in Romans chapter 6 verse 1-2 where he says, "Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? God forbid." &gt;&gt; Amen. In the in the New Living Translation, it says it like this. Well then, should we keep on sinning so that God can show us more and more of his wonderful grace? Of course not. He says, since we have died to sin, how can we continue to live in it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, if we don't use we don't use Amen. the the grace of God, Amen. to make it a disgrace or to make it greasy grace. Amen. &gt;&gt; We use it, Amen. Praise God. When there's truly been, Amen. a a a genuine mistakes that we make because we're human. We are going to fail and make mistakes. &gt;&gt; But I'm so glad that God, Amen, has a way out for you and I. Amen. How many believe that? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. Amen. So, and so Paul in in in in in Romans 7, he's identifying the source of the problem and he's not shifting the plane. Paul is not saying, "I'm not responsible." You know, there's people that that that that that that you know, they're they're caught in a trap. They're caught in sin and they want to blame someone else for their problems, but it's they're the ones who did it. &gt;&gt; You're the one at fault. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not your mom's fault. It's not your dad's fault. It's not the pastor's fault. It's you. The problem is with you. Amen. So, you have to look deep within. Amen. Where the problem is lying. And so the real enemy is deeper than behavior. It's a power or law within your flesh or spirit. Amen. Because we're we have that law in there that we're con until we get the body change, saints, we're going to have a law, amen, in there wrestling with us, &gt;&gt; wrestling us. Just because you have the Holy Ghost, Amen. does not mean that you don't get tempted to look at a a woman that's half-dressed out here in the street. All right. &gt;&gt; Just because you have the Holy Ghost doesn't mean that another man can catch your attention, sisters. Amen. Just because you have the Holy Ghost doesn't mean I'm going to that you won't get tempted to cheat on your taxes. Tax season coming around now. Just because you have a go Holy Ghost doesn't mean you're not going to get tempted with the music that you used to listen to. Right? &gt;&gt; When you go out to the stores and you go out and listen to in the restaurants and you're there with your family trying to enjoy time and all of a sudden that song from the '9s starts coming. Oh, Backstreet Boy. [laughter] And then and then all of a sudden the the lyrics come and you're not you were not even thinking of that song. Why? Because all that's built into your subconscious in that sinful nature. Amen. And that's where your where your soul what what God has done in you. Amen. Comes and has to rise up. When the when the enemy comes, the spirit of God raises up a standard. The Bible says, amen. &gt;&gt; That's when you have to fight. &gt;&gt; Amen. And say, I'll squash this &gt;&gt; because I know where this will lead me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So knowing this, knowing this, it will help you to depend on God for strength and victory and not yourself. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; So this helps you to know that it's God that's going to do this for me, not you yourself. Not nothing that you can do. You can't repent too much. You can't you can't cry too much. You can't come and get your hands laid upon here uh too much and and think that I'm gonna fix it somehow or the pastor's going to fix it somehow. No, it's got to be God and God only. Amen. &gt;&gt; You've had to depend on him. Amen. That he will take care of it. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Because he ultimately he's the one who gets the glory. &gt;&gt; If it was something that you could do, then you would get the glory. &gt;&gt; But there's nothing that you and I can do. when you have fallen into and and and made a mistake or you've done something wrong. Amen. That's the time for you to come back to him. &gt;&gt; Not to get away from him further. No, come back. &gt;&gt; Because if you want restoration, if God has already started a work in you, you'll desire restoration. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. So God's going to make sure God's going to make sure to get the glory through your struggle. You know, let me just talk to your parents. I put there raising children for a moment because you know sometimes as as uses that that we've raised children and we were talking to to some couples there in in in in Canada how they're going through stages right now where they're raising starting to raise teenage children and their children now are coming to a point where they're they're they're they're they're getting uh their own their own opinions about things now about how I should How about about even political things, even societal things and their own opin and then it almost leaves the the parent flabbergasted now. Wow, they have their own opinion about things now. Yeah, you did too. You did too. They start forming their own opinion about life, right? Because they're in the middle of trying to search out God for themselves. See, you can only take them to a certain point. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then God has to start dealing with them. But that is the time for you to just go ahead. The Lord, when I came and I brought him here to be dedicated to you when they were a little babies, it wasn't for me to hold him by the hand the rest of my life. &gt;&gt; No, it was for me to hold them until a certain point and then give them over to you. Amen. So that you can let them go. So that they can you can lead them the rest of the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so I told the brother, I said, because you know, the the the he's he's having to go through that and it's very it's very uh it's daunting to them because the parents were raised in the message and and now these kids, Amen. That's that's all they've known is the message and they don't know anything else. &gt;&gt; And because they don't know anything else, that's why the world is so much attractive to them. &gt;&gt; You see, cuz they haven't kissed a boy. They haven't kissed a girl. They haven't done no things like that like you did when you were out in the world. If you g if if if you if you were out in the world, I was one of them. &gt;&gt; I didn't grow up in the message, &gt;&gt; right? So then you wonder, well, why is it that they're not do they're not doing it the way I I I came up? Amen. But do you have to understand that they have to have their own experience with God? You see, and you can't stop that. You can't hinder that because everything is going to work together for the good. Amen. You can only be a light. You can guide them. Be there for them. Be a friend to them. Share. Share. You live the gospel before them &gt;&gt; so that they can be thirsty. Be salty before them. Amen. Praise God. And I told her the brother, I said, 'Listen, if if you raised them up, let's say you raised your kids up and and they did everything right, and I don't know what parent wouldn't want that. [laughter] We would love for our kids to do everything right, serve the Lord, get up, get up uh get up from bed on time, go to school, do all their homework, and do everything. Amen. Us not have to say nothing to them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It would be so wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. But let's say they did everything right. Amen. Because they listened to you every time you told them, "Do it this way. Do it this way. Okay, mommy, I'll do it that way." And they do it. That's wonderful. But at the end, you're the one who's going to end up getting the glory and not God. Right. &gt;&gt; But when it's God, when it's them messing up their lives and them and them and them falling into the deepest pits where you can't really do anything, amen, to take them out yourself, but it's got to be God. &gt;&gt; Then God will get the glory then because God's the only one who can take him out. &gt;&gt; Amen. I told that to a brother there in Canada and he it kind of he didn't he it shocked him. He didn't really see it that way before. I hope that helped him. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we have to see our children. Amen. The way we raise them, it it has to take God. Amen. Have confidence that God is doing the work in them. They might be the rebellious kids right now, but have confidence that God is taking that rebellion and turning it into something good. &gt;&gt; Amen. They're listening to the word. So the seed's coming in there and that seed's going to produce life someday. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. I'm so glad for that. So think of it like this there and we still in Romans 7 that if if if recognizing the disease is what drives you to seek the cure, right? If you're not if you don't feel sick or if you're not if you're not uh know that you're sick, then you won't recognize that you need a cure, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we we we instead of us maintaining like brother Aaron was talking about on Wednesday, maintaining with supplements, vitamins, uh things like that because we are so deficient in in in in our soil is not the way it used to be anymore. Our food is totally hybridized. Uh and if you want to buy good food, you better you're gonna pay a a pretty penny for it. When at some at one point in life, it was just it was just free. It was just uh that's how food was always. Now a McDonald's burger I is cheap, but it's not probably not good for you. [laughter] Not like a a a chicken sandwich made from a a a bread that was traditionally made and and and chicken that was pasture-raised. &gt;&gt; That's probably much better, right? or beef that was grass-fed or something like that, right? But but you see, so if you're not So we're got we're having to to supplement now. And and because sometimes we don't supplement or sometimes we don't maintain, amen, our health, then we go running for the the medicine cabinet when we get sick. Right? &gt;&gt; But it's too late then because now your body is telling you uh out outwardly there's something wrong inwardly. So that's why you're dripping and you're you're sneezing now and and your eyes are all puffy and and your skin itches now. It's because the body is trying to tell you it's trying to fight something that has invaded your body. Right. &gt;&gt; But if we if we help maintain Amen. And so going back to the spiritual, Amen. Recognizing the disease is what drives you to to seek the cure. Recognize that you have a spiritual disease. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then you can recognize that you can go to the healer. Amen. For that spiritual disease. &gt;&gt; Then you know who is who is your healer. Praise God. So, I'm so glad that there in in in that scripture in Romans 7, Paul says, "Oh, what a miserable person I am. Who will free me from this life that is dominated by sin and death?" But he says, here's the answer he gives. But thank God, the answer is in Jesus Christ our Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus. Now, I want us to get here to something real quick. And I'm trying to go quickly cuz I have several slides and I apologize for for going too quick but I don't want to keep you keep you all here uh for forever. All right. So your question may be, have I sinned too far in 2025? Have I gone too far? Have I done so much? Amen. That that that that God won't restore me. God won't. And this is a question that a lady asked brother Brandham in the message uh question and answers in 1962. And he says here she the question is I lived many years in sin until I found the Lord. Please brother Brandham I have sinned again and I am not worthy not worthy to come before you in this holy place. Please tell me if I can be restored holy again. Please help me brother Brandham. I have a devil in me. Help me. Will you lay your hands upon me and restore me again? It was a sincere question. And most of us, what we'd do, we'd probably throw this woman out by our legalistic ways. &gt;&gt; We thought you you did it again. You ain't coming back in here anymore. You You You're putting that on again. You ain't coming You ain't coming back in here anymore. you you have your hair like that again, you ain't coming back in here anymore. But you see this woman, Amen, she recognized that she was in the wrong and all she wants is grace and help. And so she's asking a person who who had the vindication of God during that time, the prophet of God, brother Brandham, help me, lay hands on me. I have a devil in me. She recognized that she had a disease. &gt;&gt; Right? And that's the first step for you to be right. You're already right when you recognize that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you don't recognize it at all, then you're not you're not right at all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But when you recognize, I have a problem. I need help. You're on your road to recovery. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And look what Brother Brandham says with a resounding no. No, that's not what he says. He says yes. Yes, you have not sinned, my friend, so far in God, but what you could be restored. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you had sinned so far that you could not be restored, I want you to listen to this. If you had sinned so far that you could not be restored, you'd never want to be restored. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? The fact that she was asking brother Brandham, "Brother Brandom, I want to be restored. I want help. I need help. That's because there was restoration there for her. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, see, but as long as there is something dealing in your heart, you're still in line of restoration. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. As long as God God doesn't leave you alone. Amen. &gt;&gt; No matter how deep you might have gotten in the world, no matter how how deep you've gotten in sin, Amen. If you're a son and daughter of God, God's not going to lose you. Amen. He said, "I will not lose not one." &gt;&gt; Amen. When I was out in the world, Amen. I knew better. I didn't grow up in this message, but I was a Baptist at the time. And when I was out there drinking and smoking and carrying on with girls and things like that, amen. Deep down inside my heart, something kept tugging me, kept tugging at me. You're you're you're wrong. You're wrong. You're wrong. And I could not just live a happy worldly life. &gt;&gt; I just couldn't. &gt;&gt; And so I had to just give in to God's one day and say, "Lord, I can't I'm miserable even in the world. &gt;&gt; Trying to live like a worldly person." &gt;&gt; And then that's when God gave me peace. &gt;&gt; When I gave it all over to him. You're not going to have true peace until you really give over to give your life over to him, saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham keeps saying, he says, "If you had sinned so far that you could not be restored, you never want to be restored." See, but as long as there is something dealing with your heart, you're still in line of restoration. Guilty of the least is guilty of the whole. I have sinned many times. Look, Brother Brandham said, "I have sinned many times." Wow. Some of us live life like brother Brandham didn't make a mistake. But he says right here, I have sinned many times. &gt;&gt; I have sinned many times. Every day. Every every day. Every one of us do things that we don't want to do. &gt;&gt; The prophet saying that. &gt;&gt; Oh no. The prophet was holy. He did not make a mistake. I beg your pardon. He was a sinner saved by grace &gt;&gt; just like you and I. He needed just as much grace as you and I did. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, it's in our heart. And that's what we were talking about there from Romans 7. You don't want to be that way. &gt;&gt; He's he's he's answering this woman's question. You don't want to be that way or you wouldn't ask this question &gt;&gt; because a person who does doesn't does doesn't want to change wouldn't care any anything about &gt;&gt; and writing a question down like that right taking their time that's itself a proof that God is still dealing with you &gt;&gt; oh my this ain't this ain't deep but it's deep [laughter] &gt;&gt; you've probably gotten nervous probably Satan telling you that you can't be restored Lord, he's lying. Certainly, he is. See? Amen. Because look, if there is a deep calling, there's got to be a deep to respond to the call. &gt;&gt; I'll just let brother Brandham say it. If there's a hunger for something, that something's got to be somewhere or you would you would have no hunger for it. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the res that means [snorts] that the restoration or God who restores had to be there first before she could hunger for that. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So there. So in order you want to be right, you want to come back to God, but what are you coming to? It's because something's drawing you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And in John 6:65 it says, "Therefore said Jesus is saying because Jesus didn't save you to lose you." &gt;&gt; He said, "Therefore said I unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father." &gt;&gt; Amen. It's God that draws. It's God that does the drawing. Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus. He also said in John 10:28, he said, "And I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never, never." Everybody say, "Never." &gt;&gt; All right, you're awake. They shall never perish. Neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. &gt;&gt; Jesus said that. So, if you've come to God and you've received the Holy Ghost and you've been born again, but you've fallen fallen, you know, you've backslid or you or you or you or you kind of got cold on God. Amen. And and and Amen. God said he won't lose you. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Now, we'll read here just a moment something that Brother Brandham said, but Jesus keeps going. He says, "My father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to plug them out of my father's hand." &gt;&gt; Oh, the grace of God. See, when Jesus was saying this, he wasn't saying that they will never make mistakes ever again. He knows because of your humanity and the law that's within you, right, of sin. But he said, "I'll they'll never perish." Why? Because they're going to keep repenting. They're going to keep they're going to keep needing my grace. They're going to keep desiring my blood. Amen. Praise God. Now, that's not a sin. That's not a license for you to just keep doing doing things, bad things, and and keep sinning. No. Amen. As we just talked about, shall we make grace, Amen, disgrace, as Paul said. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Now, brother Bram says here and speaking about that Jesus didn't save you to lose you. Amen. How could he save something that that later on he's going to lose? &gt;&gt; Then he he's not God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because he can't lose anything that he knows. [laughter] &gt;&gt; And he's known you. Amen. Before the foundation of the world. Praise God. So he can't lose anything that belongs to him. Amen. When when when you know where you've put something. Amen. Some of us who have uh you know kids who who where is my where is my shoe? Well, it's where you last put it. I don't know. I had them here and and Oh, they were they were in the basement. I didn't put them there. But you see, it's not with God that way. &gt;&gt; God cannot lose what he already knows. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not that way with God. Even though you may get all tangled up like that, like that visual we just saw. Amen. He knows exactly where you're at. &gt;&gt; See, when Adam sinned, Amen. He It wasn't that he was asking Adam, Adam, Adam, where are you? I don't know where you are. Where are you? Are you behind here? Are you behind this bush? God knew exactly where Adam was. &gt;&gt; He just wanted Adam to recognize where he was at. &gt;&gt; When you recognize where you're at, then you're you're in line for help. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. [applause] You're in line for help. Amen. God knows exactly your heart. &gt;&gt; God knows why you're here this morning. &gt;&gt; God knows, Amen. exactly where your heart is right now. If it's on the Georgia Bulldog game right now, or if it's on God, &gt;&gt; if it's on the pot of beans that you have at home, or if it's on God, or if it's on your children, amen, who are not living worthy, or if it's on God. Amen. Praise God. God knows exactly where where you where where where where your heart is. &gt;&gt; Because where your heart is, there there your treasures will be also. Now before brother Brandon keeps saying here brother now before there can be a creation there has to be a creator to create the creation. See what I mean? Now as long as you are wanting and hungering to get back to God remember this is a new year. There's a God somewhere calling to you. See or you wouldn't be hungering. &gt;&gt; There's a creator. Brother Brandham says now if you there is a place that you can cross where you can't get back. But when that is your when when that is you're down there again in the same shape you was in other words it's a it's a cycle. Amen. It goes to show that you only fell from grace. You can get back into that grace &gt;&gt; because that grace is still calling out. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's crying out grace. grace. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, look what brother Brandham says here. He says, "Backsliding is not lost." &gt;&gt; Oh, that brother backslid. I tell you what, he just doesn't come to church anymore. Or that sister doesn't come to she and him or she or him are backslid. Amen. Brother Brandon says backsliding is not lost. &gt;&gt; He said it. Do we believe he's a prophet? See, because us and our nature, we just want to throw everybody out. &gt;&gt; Oh, they just don't do it the way I think they should do it. They don't come the way they don't come to church every single service the way I do it. I'm They're not [snorts] [sighs and gasps] They're not in my in my circle. You'd be surprised who's going to be in heaven that day &gt;&gt; and who won't be in heaven. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says backsliding is not lost. I want somebody to tell me where backsliding is lost and prove it to me by the Bible. Brother Brandham says backslider is not lost. He says he's just out of fellowship. &gt;&gt; Right? We can go deeper into that, but maybe at another time. Israel backslid, but they never lost their covenant. &gt;&gt; Right? When brother Brand when when the Lord told Israel that I've given you a land flowing with milk and honey, that never that promise never was taken away from them. No matter how many times they got down to worship Baal, &gt;&gt; right? No matter how many times they laid with prostitute women and and married other people and and and and that promise was still that promise was still there &gt;&gt; and they could come back to back to that promise and align themselves back to that. Amen. &gt;&gt; They lost their their praises and joy. And we'll talk about joy here in a moment. David lost the joy of his salvation. See, when he took Bethshea, Uriah's wife, but he never lost his salvation. This is your prophet speaking. This is not me. I didn't write this down. This is your prophet saying this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. And and for us to for us to to to not show the grace that our own prophet showed in this hour. Amen. That's a disgrace within itself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If the prophet was so gracious, Amen. Amen. How how much more should we be in this hour when the copstone is crying grace, grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. He never said, David never said, "Restore to me," this is still brother Brandham speaking, "Restore to me my salvation." David never said that when we were in the scripture we just read. He said, "Restore to me the joy of my salvation." &gt;&gt; All right? And we'll talk about that here in a moment. Oh, there's so much of this legalism today. Hey, brother Brandham says, "Oh my, we find it." And let me tell you, in Latin America, you find it a lot. I'm I'm a Latin I'm a Latino and we just we're just macho and and and and we're legalists. &gt;&gt; We don't say we are, but our actions show that we are. &gt;&gt; And I I you see it there in in the countries and you know, the man doesn't go in the kitchen at all. Doesn't do anything in the kitchen. That's the woman's job. You're supposed to, you know, what, you know, sweetheart, and and you know, they'll say, "Sweetheart, you know, I'm hungry." And and and she's over there, you know, she's she's she's dealing with the with the babies that you help bring into this world, by the way. &gt;&gt; She's over there dealing, oh, okay, honey, I'm coming. I'm coming. You know how to go into in the fridge and make yourself a sandwich. or you didn't learn that &gt;&gt; then that was your mom's fault then. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; we're not too big. A man is not too big to not go in and wash dishes. Brother Brandham went in and put on an apron and wash dishes. &gt;&gt; Oh, this ain't the seals, but it's deep. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, because some of us, we don't like that. We're we're too Latino. We're too we're too macho. You know, we're too, you know, we like legalism. See, and Brother Brandham says there's so much of this legalism today. The touch not, taste not. You don't do things legally. Brother Brandham says, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; I want you to get that because let me tell you, this legalism is rising back up again. &gt;&gt; And you see it in the political world and you also see it in the spiritual world. All right. It's what it's what you can do, but it's not what you can do. It's what he's done. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, David says uh in Psalms 51:12, it says, uh, "Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, and uphold me with thy free spirit." Amen. Now, we often times we confuse losing our joy with losing our salvation. when we do wrong. &gt;&gt; But you see as that brother Brandham just said, you you have not lost your salvation. &gt;&gt; How can God lose something when he has already saved it that he didn't really lose, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Okay. The prod now watch this. The prodigal son, this is this is my notes. The prodigal son only lost his joy. He did not lose his identity. He still had a father to come back to &gt;&gt; when he was out and and and and and drinking and and and and took the the the the everything the the the money from his father and and and went out and and and spended it all and on righteous living on righteous living and and lived with women and done and then all and then he's back in with pigs eating what they were eating. Amen. He within himself he was out of he was out of line. Amen. But within himself he knew that he could go back to the father. &gt;&gt; He knew that he had a father that he can come back to. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just like that song, I have a father. &gt;&gt; He knows my name. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus. So he he just lost his joy because see when you lose your joy Amen. your joy. And we'll talk about this here in a moment. We we'll get to it. When you lose your joy, Amen. you're losing it. Amen. That zeal that you have for God, and you're putting it into something else. Amen. &gt;&gt; And in the case of the of the of the of the of the uh the prodigal son, he lost his joy in serving God or he lost his joy in what he was doing growing up under the supervision and the guidance of his father and putting it into something else. And when you do that, Amen. then that's when you begin to lose your joy. And that's when you begin to backslide. And that's when you begin. When you put something else before God, &gt;&gt; that's you putting everything, your zeal, your passion, your focus, your joy into that instead of God. And then you wonder, where am I, Lord? What has happened a year, a year later? It's because you lost your focus. You lost your joy. Amen. And so what we want to do is we want to say we want to say um oh I I need to get saved again. I need to get rebaptized again. I need to I need to repent. I I you do need to repent but I I need to do everything over again. And and and in reality you don't. All you need to do is see what robbed you of your joy and work from there. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And start from there. What is captivating you more than God? &gt;&gt; Right now, we live in this life. We're going to have our jobs. We're going to do things. We're going to we're going to go out. We're going to travel. We're going to We have to live life. But what is priority before everything is God. &gt;&gt; I always have God in the forefront, right? Everything else is secondary. And God is not telling you you can't you can't do this. You can't go out. you can't you can't have this membership. You can't do this. No, no, no. God is not saying that. But God is saying, "Put everything. Put me first &gt;&gt; and then all these other things, they will be added unto you." &gt;&gt; And they and even sometimes in abundance. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; So let's look at the difference between joy and happiness for a moment. Happiness is usually I want you to pay attention to this because sometimes we confuse happiness and joy. Happiness is usually tied to circumstances. &gt;&gt; See the word itself is related to happen. &gt;&gt; Happiness happen right and it comes from what happens. It changes quickly. It depends on comfort, success, health or outcomes, right? It depends on, you know, if if if I got a if I got a bonus at the end of the year, I'm happy &gt;&gt; at my job. Oh, I didn't get a bonus this year. I don't know if I'm going to serve God this coming year. &gt;&gt; See, that that's happiness. It it changes. It fluctuates back and forth. &gt;&gt; Right. It's not constant, right? And it can disappear when life gets hard. &gt;&gt; That's that's happiness. &gt;&gt; Now, we all like to be happy, right? &gt;&gt; I like to see you all happy when I come to church, &gt;&gt; but I know that can change. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because sometimes you might come in grumpy, but I'm not going to I'm not going to look at you and say, "He's just a grumpy old man all the time." No. Something may have caused to change that happiness. &gt;&gt; Something back home or your children or or something happened at your job or or or something, right? But I know within yourself, you're not that way, right? And that's where joy comes in, right? Joy is deeper and more stable, right? It comes from who you trust, &gt;&gt; not what happens around you. &gt;&gt; All right? So the externals don't change the joy. Right? It exists alongside pain, sorrow, or struggle. In other words, you can have hard times, but joy is still there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe happiness won't be, but joy is still there. &gt;&gt; Right? It's rooted in hope, meaning, and relationship with God. Amen. And it endures even when circumstances are difficult. &gt;&gt; Right? So joy is something stable. So you can think of it like this. Happiness is like the weather. It changes. And my we live in Georgia and that happens all the time. &gt;&gt; At least in Canada, you know what you're going to get. in Georgia. You just don't know. My goodness. I feel like I have long hair that I keep doing this. I don't know if I like this. My my But joy joy is like the climate. It's like climate. It shapes the environment long term. &gt;&gt; Right. It shapes your environment long term. So that's the difference between joy and happiness. And hey, if you if you if you want these these uh these slides, I'll be more than glad to share them with you. Anybody can have our notes are not proprietary to us. Amen. You can have all these notes yourself. Amen. Because that's it's God's word. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you can go if you want to go back and read read through them. Now in Nehemiah 8:10, the Bible says, "Then he said unto them, go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto them, for whom nothing is prepared, for this day is holy unto our Lord, neither be ye sorry, for the joy of the Lord is what? &gt;&gt; Your strength." &gt;&gt; And that's where we get, amen, the song, the joy of the Lord is my strength. But this is where the verse comes from. For the joy of the Lord is your strength. Now remember, joy is something constant. &gt;&gt; All right? And that is one of that is what that is what's going to give you strength to move forward. To conquer this year like you've never conquered any other years before, &gt;&gt; right? To grow spiritually like you've never grown spiritually before. &gt;&gt; To overcome that habit like you've never overcome that before. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is to maintain joy. And what is joy? being focused and being happy about serving God. &gt;&gt; Cuz when you lose that and you put it all on Netflix, Amen. you've lost joy. &gt;&gt; Now Netflix has got your joy or YouTube's got your joy or something else, Instagram or Deepop or whatever. Everything that's out there now, it's gotten your joy. Now, God wants you to be joyous &gt;&gt; so that you can could so that you can have strength. And if you don't know whatop is, it's a selling platform where people are getting on there selling things now. Kind of like am Amazon a little bit. How do we lose our joy then? that if you take the joy of the Lord and put it in something else, as we've been talking, put in your joy and focus on other things instead of God and his word, your job, friends, family. See, all these things, they're not bad, &gt;&gt; but your focus is on that. &gt;&gt; Your family is more important to come to church. You've lost your joy. &gt;&gt; It's hard to say. your career. Well, I have to work on Sundays, but you know that there's an option for you not to have to &gt;&gt; but you don't take it. You've lost your joy. &gt;&gt; Your house. Oh, some of us are concerned about our house. Our house and our house can become a focus. All right. That can make you lose your joy. Your pet. Oh my I saw the other day, you know, the other day it it was the most pitiful sight and I just couldn't help to think what brother Brandham said that in this day that even in that day, you know, that women would prefer to just have a pet, have a dog instead of getting married and have babies and things like that. and and and and it was it was a it was a I mean they they they they put like diapers on their pets and stuff now and they put them in strollers and and going around in the mall and the and the dog the poor dog's in there. [laughter] You got the poor dog's in there, you know, like wondering what in the world they got him in strollers now. you, you know, uh, and so we can we can consume ourselves with our pets so much that we don't come to church because they're sick. You lost your joy then. Or we can consume oursel with our investments. &gt;&gt; All right? Don't put anything before God. Brother Brandham says here, he says, listen to this quote. I know I'm reading a lot. Amen. It's deep though &gt;&gt; and we all need this. &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, that's just for the young people. I thought you were a young person too &gt;&gt; at heart." &gt;&gt; No, this is for all of us. &gt;&gt; Why do you hunger, church? Why do you thirst? This is brother Brandon. Christ is the mystery of God revealed after he preached the seals. He says, "It's the father trying to reveal this hidden secret to you." But watch what he says. But you let so many things get it out of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You let your job, you let your wife, you let your husband, you let your children, you let the cares of the world, you let some pastor, you let somebody else get that out of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you know that way down in your heart you're thirsting and you're hungry and you're using those things to replace that thirst and that hunger that God's placed in you for him. &gt;&gt; It's God trying to reveal it to you. &gt;&gt; See the revelation instead of and and so that that's where the quote that's where the quote ends. And see so we let these things Amen. get the joy of the Lord out of our lives and we replace them with these other things. And they may not be bad. God's given you a family. God's given you children. God's given you a wife. And God's given you a a husband. Amen. Those things are not bad. Amen. But it's when your focus is on that to please them instead of pleasing the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, the Lord will always be there. I'll come back to him. No. Then you'll then then what will happen is that you will you will you will you will see yourself less and less. Amen. Not wanting to because I can't I've been away from him so long. How can I come back to him? And it's just a trap of the enemy &gt;&gt; to keep you further and further away. See what happened to David. Amen. When he had to repent that instead of fighting and staying on the firing line, Amen. as a king, he stayed home, right? He stayed home instead of doing what he was supposed to do, right? Enjoying the pleasures of life, which of course led to sin and the loss of his joy, right? He had it all. He He could He had multiple wives. I don't know how he did it, but he had multiple wives and concubines. And so this is and so this is what happened to Satan. This is what Satan's trick is to make us look to legalism to fix the problem instead of returning back to our joy. So what happens is instead of instead of you addressing what stole your joy, &gt;&gt; right? Let's just say it let's just say it's your job. Instead of you addressing that, what you do is say 2026 is coming and we're going to I'm going to make sure I start doing devotionals more well with my family and I'm going to make sure that I start praying more and I'm I just start doing and I'm reading my Bible more. Instead of reading one one verse, I'm going to read three verses every day. And I'm going to make sure that I that that I keep up with this. And you and and what you try to do is you try to make your family as well try to obey that. Try to follow that as well. And when they don't want to do it, Amen. You you start getting upset and you start getting frustrated because don't you understand? I'm trying to get back. Why aren't you all in in line? The problem is is that they didn't lose their joy. You did. &gt;&gt; And so you want to mold them to what you want. And you get frustrated and then again and then you start reading the word and you start reading the message and you start seeing there how brother Brandham starts condemning your life and then he's like this is worse than than than I should have just not even started and now back and then you go back to what was bringing you the joy &gt;&gt; back to your job again working 80 hours instead of 40 missing in church, missing time with your family, doing what you're supposed and we're always in this cycle and you because you tried to fix it through legalism and legalism never works. &gt;&gt; Your legalism will never will will never appease God. Amen. So David, that's what he thought when he when uh that he could return back to his joy through legalism. Because when Nathan came to him, the prophet, and told him about the about the uh uh uh the the the the uh the story of the man who had many sheep and many things and and then there was only one who had one and and that man came and took that one sheep from him. And what did David do? Because this is what what this is what we do. Amen. We do something about it. Kill that man. Capture and take him. David knew what he had done wrong. And so he was trying to appease. Maybe this will appease God. Amen. Through my legalism. Amen. Do something about that man. Get in him. And Nathan the prophet had to tell him, but you're that man. &gt;&gt; In other words, came down to the point, you're the problem. It's not your family and it's not the pastor and it's not the church. You are the problem. &gt;&gt; You are the problem. &gt;&gt; It's not, oh, it's the president or it's it's the economy. No, you the president can't make you pray less or pray more. It's you who wants to or not. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you can't fix it with legalism, but you can by faith. faith in God's word. Amen. Stay with me. Now, we're we're we're coming down to to to the wire. Now, Brother Brandham says, "Will you lay hands upon me and free?" This is the same lady that was asking the question we just read earlier. And so, Brother Brandham gives the answer uh gives adds to that to that answer. She says, Brother Brandham's rereading the question, "Now, will you lay hands upon me? I'm free from that. Sister dear or brother dear. Sure I'd lay hands on you, but that wouldn't free you. &gt;&gt; It's not about you coming up here and say, "Brother Wade, I know Brother Wade or if the or Brother Daryl Ward comes or if any evangelist who who's had miracles in their life or does great things, if they could just lay their hands on my child, I know everything will be all right." Amen. No, it's your faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. And see, brother Brennham himself with the ministry that he had, he said, "Sister dear, I could lay hands on you, but that wouldn't free you." &gt;&gt; See, what would free you? What would restore your joy? You you you're is to understand that you're already free. &gt;&gt; You're already free. Amen. You're already untied. You don't have to worry about being free. You're already free. Brother Brandham says, &gt;&gt; "Amen. Jesus made you free." &gt;&gt; This is still the prophet. &gt;&gt; Be not again entangled in the yoke of bondage. You're free as you can be. &gt;&gt; You don't have to be tangled up. Laying my hands on you is just a tradition. &gt;&gt; We might We might do that. that that why I could do that. But that still wouldn't set you free until you accept what he done for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's just me saying, "Lord, I believe it and I'm getting up from this place that I'm at and moving forward." &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you said it already in your word. That's you. Amen. Believing his word and taking it. Amen. And moving forward with it. &gt;&gt; Praise God. That's why brother Bram said that sin is unbelief. Unbelief in what? Unbelief in what he already said about you. &gt;&gt; And trying to add your own ideas to it or your own thoughts about it or your own legalism about it. Amen. God already said accept what God said. Amen. &gt;&gt; And let him already he's you're free. So that you might have started this year and we're 11 days in. Amen. And you still don't feel free. You're free today. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're free. you right now. &gt;&gt; I don't have to lay hands on you. Brother Aaron doesn't have to lay hands on you. No deacon here has to lay hands on you. Go out there and accept what God has already done for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Take God at his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. You know, I just to add to this, you know, when we go out in in in in in the mission field and and it's just it makes me so so sad sometimes to see, you know, people, young people especially, who have who want to make their life right and you've preached a sermon or I've interpreted for a brother there who's who's who has preached and and they come through and you see the same people coming through the line constantly. or coming up front and it's the same problem, the same issue, the year after year, month after month, and whenever you go, it's the same person. &gt;&gt; And I'm like, they just haven't gotten they they haven't gotten a revelation of what joy really is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to have a revelation. Listen, I can't I I can't I can't change your life. Brother Wade can't change your life. It's got to be you to do it. See, until until until David realized that he was the one who sinned, then he went and did something about it. &gt;&gt; You've got to do something about it. Your own self. Brother Wade can't fix it for you. Brother Dell certainly couldn't fix it for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm sure he would wanted to, but he couldn't. &gt;&gt; You've got to do it on your own &gt;&gt; because it's a walk. What is it? When we were been discussing, Amen. last year. Amen. And it's between you and God in that secret place. &gt;&gt; And that's what it's coming down to now. It's not a group think anymore. It's a it's a it's a it's in the inner veil is just you and God. &gt;&gt; Amen. On the outer court, it was it's everybody. Everybody's getting preached to. Amen. And then in the inner court, Amen. In the in the holy place, it's only a few people that will go in there. But in the Holy of Holies, it's got to be you and God only. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because only the priest would go in there. &gt;&gt; And I'm so glad that Lord Jesus Christ, our high priest, went in there already once and for all. And then all he wants us to do is come to him and say, "Lord, I am the I am the problem." &gt;&gt; And Lord, change me from the inside out. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. &gt;&gt; See, and brother Brandon says that why I could do that. I could lay hands on you, but that still wouldn't set you free until you accept what he done for you. Amen. That's just me saying, "Lord, I believe it." All right. So, we're talking about new beginnings. Amen. And I'm coming down to to the close now. Nature, we know it expresses new beginnings. How many like new beginnings? &gt;&gt; How many like multiple chances? Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, I I I you know, those of us who play video games, I used to be a very big video game guy and I just I I still like them, but I don't have time to play them anymore. I like to play Mario every now and then. You know, I'm a still a kid at heart. [laughter] But when you played Mario, when you played Tetris, or you played any of those games, Amen. You liked when you had multiple lives [laughter] and you put in that code in there. Amen. To get you to have unlimited lives, [laughter] right? Some of you remember that. Amen. Back in the 80s and 90s, you'd put the code. Amen. To get unlimited lives. There's no way I can die now. I'm going to beat this game. Amen. God has already put the code in for you. Amen. On the cross of Calvary. Amen. 2,000 years ago. Amen. You have unlimited chances. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you've predestinated, he said, "I'll I'll I'll not lose one." &gt;&gt; Contrary to what any brother might say, contrary to what you might have done in the past, Amen. God has given you unlimited lives. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord if we can put it that way. Amen. So, so if if if it's like that and we like it. Amen. Nature also expresses new beginnings. Amen. Spring after winter. Amen. We see when as dur we're now in winter time. We're looking forward to the springtime. Amen. When warmer weather comes in, right? You think, "Oh, when when winter comes in, everything's dying. The leaves are dying and everything's falling and oh no, it's everything is just falling apart. It's going to stay like this." Nope. In March, amen, everything will start coming back up again. Oh, there's a new beginning. Amen. for each one of us. Amen. They may seem dark and it may seem it may seem weary. It may seem like it nothing will change in your life. Amen. But spring's just around the corner. The lamb has been slain before the foundation of the world. Just come to him. Amen. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Sunrise after night. &gt;&gt; You think that it's night time. Amen. And that it's oh, it's going to be dark forever. No. The next day the sun rises again. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Enjoyed that Sunday school s uh message this morning from brother Emanuel and and um he said uh talked about the seeds. Amen. Seeds when seeds planted in the ground. Amen. &gt;&gt; In order for them to grow, they have to die. &gt;&gt; Right. And they might you might think, "Oh my, it's dead. It's dying." But in order for it to live, it's got to die. &gt;&gt; So there's a renewal. Amen. There's a new beginning. Amen. It might it went in a certain way, but then it's coming out a different way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're coming out stronger than what you think. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. You might came in, Amen. crying and booing. Amen. Or or or low in faith, but you had some faith. Amen. But you'll come out, Amen. stronger than ever. &gt;&gt; If you stay in his word. Praise the Lord. A metamorphosis. Amen. Which which means it's the caterpillar turn into a butterfly. Amen. Who would think that a caterpillar or a a nasty fuzzy worm, amen, would ever be something beautiful flying in the springtime, &gt;&gt; in the summertime. &gt;&gt; Amen. And those those are beautiful. Nobody would ever think that. Only God could do something like that. &gt;&gt; And if God can do it for the that little worm, how much more for you? Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And then of course, a rain after a drought. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So nature constantly teaches us that endings are hidden beginnings. &gt;&gt; Amen. When something seems like it's ended, my life is ended here. I spiritual life, I can't go on with God. That's just the beginning for God. &gt;&gt; That's where God could use you more. That's where God could get his glory into more. Not when you're really strong and I'm going to make it. No. God can't use that. Yeah. Dormcy is not death. Renewal can be gradual or sudden. New life often follows hardships. Amen. We know that the number eight, the eighth day, it means a fresh start. It means a new beginning. Circumcision was commanded on the eighth day, right? A new beginning for that boy, for that for the for the baby. You read that in Genesis 17:12. Jesus rose on the first day of the week which is also the eighth day if you count exclusively. Amen. [clears throat] Praise God. So the number eight uh the number uh so seven we know it means completion. Eight is what comes next and eight also is renewal, resurrection, a fresh start. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many believe that God's given you a fresh start? Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe I'll raise my hands, too. Amen. God is a God of many chances. Praise God. Look what Lamentations 3:22 says. It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed. They are new every morning. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They are new. His mercies are new. It didn't say just just few mornings. No, every morning. Psalms 103:8 says, "The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger compared to some of us, slow to anger and plenteous in mercy." &gt;&gt; Amen. And in second Peter, Amen. God is not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. Right? That's his desire. And that should be our desire, too. If we have God in us, don't you know? Oh, that's got to be a serpent seed. I mean, look at all the tattoos they got. Look at the way they talk. Look at that foul mouth. That's serpent seed. You'd be surprised. &gt;&gt; You would be surprised. God probably has something great. I mean, look at look at my uncle. Foulmouth. I saw him when I was younger growing up, you know, drinking and I saw him drunk all the time and he had women and things and look at him now. Raises my faith now. &gt;&gt; You'd be surprised what God can do. &gt;&gt; Amen. There is no there is no secret of what God can do. Amen. It is no secret what God can do. &gt;&gt; What he's done for others, he'll do for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Brandham says here and I believe this is the last two or three slides in in the message everlasting life and how to receive it. Brother Brandham says and I believe it's appropriate. Amen. For the new year it's obedience is better than sacrifice. Do what the Holy Spirit says do. What we need tonight is to let loose of all of our little old squeezy ideas. He says I don't know why he meant about squeezy but but our own little ideas. Let let loose of them. Right? Let go what you thought was was the way you were supposed to worship God back in the denomination or let go of that. The problem is sometimes we bring from our denominations, we bring it into the message and try to put it on other people &gt;&gt; and that means you haven't been restored to the full word. You still bringing nominal things into the into into the message. Amen. And let the Holy Spirit, you are taught here, you know what's right and wrong. Brother Brown says, "You know what's right and wrong, but what you need tonight is a great big bundle full of the love of God poured out in your heart. All differences washed away." Amen. Differences with yourself, with your wife, with your pastor, with with with everybody in the church, all washed away. Amen. Bury it with the old year. Brother Brandon says, "Bury it with the old year as it passes out. Let it go. He says, &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, let it go. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's start a new life, a new beginning. Right? &gt;&gt; You can't, if you're already born in the kingdom of God, you've already got the Holy Spirit in you. The only thing you have to do is cut loose from these things of the world that's holding you down, that's that's tying you down, that's making you lose your joy. Cut loose from them. said, "Let us lay aside every weight and the sin does so easily beset us that we might run with patience the life, the race that's set before us." In Hebrews, Hebrews the 12th chapter, lay aside the weights, Brother Brandham says. Praise God. And that's the way, Amen, to get back your joy. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I believe we serve the God of new beginnings. Let this year be the best year that you've ever had, saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let this be the year where you're more into the word. Or or you might say, "Oh, I I I have to feel something. I I got to if I don't feel something." Amen. God is not asking you to feel anything. God is asking you to believe his word. &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm going to take you to for your word. It's in simplicity. &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't have to run up and down the aisles. You don't have to speak in tongues. You don't have to do anything. And although it's good and it's encouraged and we need it. &gt;&gt; Amen. But but but but that's not Amen. that's not going to restore your joy back. Amen. To restore your joy back is to believe his word. &gt;&gt; Brother I love that quote brother Brandham says. He said brother Jesus never said asked the people did you feel it? &gt;&gt; He said did you believe it? &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe his word this morning? &gt;&gt; How many believe that God can completely Amen. How many are ready to let go of the old? Amen. and and and and receive the new. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, but we're already 11 days in, brother Luis. It's too late. It's not too late for God because God don't live in time. &gt;&gt; God lives in eternity. Amen. And what he's done in you, Amen. It's an eternal work. Praise the Lord. And so, if he's already started the work in you, he will finish it until the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. God bless you. Amen. Let's stand to our feet. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's have the musicians come. I'm sorry I kept you all. I apologize. But hey, I don't get to preach often on Sunday mornings, so I took advantage. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] Let's just bow our heads, Lord Jesus. And and before we bow our heads, how how many just have a need on their heart that they just want to make known to God? Lifted lifted up your hands. I I have my eyes closed. Everybody with their eyes closed. I I don't know what your need is, but God certainly does. Amen. And you just want to go ahead and just put that burden upon the Lord. Place that need before him and confide and leave it there. And you just watch and see what God is going to do about that this year. You watch and see that God is going to restore it back just as he he restores. Amen. the day from the night and he restores back the the springtime from a winter time and he makes everything new and he makes the flowers grow and he makes something come out of something that of nothing. Amen. You watch and see if God doesn't do it. But what you have to do is put your focus, your joy back in what matters. He said, "Seek ye first first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these other things, even the need that your hand is being represented by, all those other things will be added unto you." Amen. Let's just bow our heads. Lord Jesus, we thank you, heavenly father, for your word, Lord. And we appreciate, Lord Jesus, what you have done, Father God, for us, Lord God. Lord, we're the ones who make our life difficult and you've come to simplify it for us. And we thank you, Father God, that you said, Father God, my burden is easy and my my yoke is light, Lord Jesus. And oh Lord, if we could just let you give these things over to you, Father God, you would do more abundantly, exceedingly of what we could ask, God. Lord. Oh Lord God Almighty bless my brothers and my sisters as they're facing Father another year with with uncertainty things uncertainties Father and and things Lord may they may not know the answers to everything but oh Lord you we serve a God who has all the answers of life and I pray Lord that you would help us to confide in you Lord. Bless your people Lord. Bless them Father God. Let them have strength, Father God, to raise up and believe your word, Lord, and to not disbelieve it anymore, and to not try to make it on their own, Father, but to abide and confide in what you've already done for them. Grant, Lord Jesus, I include myself in that, Lord. I find myself in a trap sometimes where I think, if I could just do more of this or if I could just listen to more of this or read more of this. But Lord God, if when I just rest in you, Father God, then then all things are well. I I can I can start [music] thinking clearly then. And Lord, that's what we want to do in this hour. Granted, Lord Jesus, bless your people now. Meet every need amongst us, Father. And we commit the rest of the service into your hands in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
