[12:35] sins keep us Lord in Jesus name
[12:39] we love you and we thank you amen and
[12:41] amen
[12:45] Romans 8.
[12:48] and we know that all things work
[12:50] together for good to them that love God
[12:52] to them who are the called according to
[12:54] his purpose for whom he did for no he
[12:57] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[12:59] the image of his son that he might be
[13:02] the firstborn among many Brethren
[13:05] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[13:07] he also called
[13:09] in whom he called to me also justified
[13:12] in whom he justified them he also
[13:13] glorified what shall we then say to
[13:17] these things if God be for us who can be
[13:20] against us I love that part don't you
[13:22] now let's turn to Genesis
[13:26] one
[13:30] 26. and God said let us make man in our
[13:33] image after our likeness and let them
[13:35] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[13:37] and over the fall of the iron over the
[13:39] cattle and over all the Earth and over
[13:42] ever creeping things that creepeth upon
[13:44] the Earth
[13:45] so God created man in his own image in
[13:47] the image of God created he him male and
[13:51] female created he them and God blessed
[13:54] them and God said unto them be fruitful
[13:57] and multiply and replace the Earth and
[14:00] subdue it and have dominion over the
[14:02] fish of the sea and over the fowl of the
[14:04] air and over every living thing that
[14:06] moveth upon the Earth amen and you may
[14:09] be seated the Lord had his Blessing to
[14:12] the reading of the word
[14:17] really enjoyed that song sister Monique
[14:20] that was
[14:22] sitting back there thinking I guess when
[14:24] we first met them was about 19 and
[14:27] 93 I guess I know we did in 95 but I
[14:31] believe it was 93 and she was just a
[14:34] little little bitty thing and and uh I
[14:37] don't know at that time where Danielle
[14:38] was even born or not but I know it
[14:41] wasn't long after the end we got to meet
[14:42] the girls there and we've always enjoyed
[14:45] being with them they're just like our
[14:46] kids
[14:48] go there they were part of our family
[14:50] I got introduced when I was over there
[14:52] one time in the school and they wanted
[14:54] them to meet their their white
[14:56] granddaddy
[14:58] yeah so what you know I've been there
[15:01] when they
[15:02] graduated and things like that and they
[15:05] they introduced me around to everybody
[15:06] to you know who I was and I appreciate
[15:10] that amen now
[15:13] uh as we've done the other day
[15:16] we uh
[15:17] you know we've had company come in and
[15:19] I'm not the kind of a person that just
[15:22] goes right straight on when company
[15:24] comes I want to drop back and try to
[15:26] help them as much as possible and so we
[15:29] did there the other day we had company
[15:30] in
[15:31] so I preached my message and then I read
[15:34] my message the next service so I guess
[15:36] that's what we're going to do this
[15:37] afternoon is we preached this morning uh
[15:41] kind of the message and this afternoon
[15:42] we're going to read it and let brother
[15:43] random say it and that'll uh that'll
[15:46] help us all but I hope we're following a
[15:49] line or a thought
[15:52] and the thought even though it seems
[15:54] like we have moved over into other
[15:57] things but remember the thought is still
[16:00] how does God predestinate
[16:04] he predestinates by foreknowledge
[16:07] all right and then by foreknowledge he
[16:10] knew that you and I would want to be
[16:13] saved
[16:14] Joey would have it for us so he really
[16:17] predestinates according to the desires
[16:20] that you and I have that we desire
[16:23] salvation so he would have it ready for
[16:25] us
[16:26] but we've also gotten into the point now
[16:28] of not just
[16:31] um I want to caution you on this thought
[16:34] that our thoughts are not just running
[16:36] as a haphazard point of coming down
[16:40] um I don't know how to get that point in
[16:43] there but I'm trying to get you and I to
[16:45] look at something
[16:47] from the revealing of the Eternal God
[16:51] in his condescending
[16:53] and not to just see the see God coming
[16:57] down
[16:58] in his condescending and remember we've
[17:01] been over and over it to talk about
[17:04] him revealing himself
[17:07] and by him revealing himself then he
[17:10] would reveal us and what we are so keep
[17:14] the thought in your mind that remember
[17:16] that uh you know sure back before the
[17:20] foundation of world he foresaw
[17:22] all of these things
[17:25] and you know could predestinate by that
[17:28] foreknowledge
[17:29] and know that Jacob have I love but Esau
[17:33] have I hated
[17:34] but
[17:35] he would do that because he would know
[17:37] what they would desire
[17:39] but then now in dealing with the uh
[17:43] offspring of God
[17:45] the children of God because that's what
[17:47] we've been talking about
[17:49] is is the children of God and that way
[17:52] don't just put that as a Jacob and an
[17:55] Esau thought in your mind to hold a
[17:58] point you know that that well he just
[18:00] foresaw it
[18:02] and you know that's the way it's going
[18:04] to be or something you know get it in
[18:07] your mind the thoughts that we've been
[18:09] trying to bring is related to now in the
[18:12] basis of
[18:15] us being a part of God
[18:18] must be in The Offspring of God us being
[18:20] the children of God
[18:22] and we have to receive eternal life to
[18:25] be that we're we don't believe in this
[18:27] these doctrines in the message now that
[18:29] you come in the world with eternal life
[18:31] I believe you come into the World by
[18:33] representation of predestination yeah
[18:36] that God would know who would want
[18:38] eternal life and who wouldn't
[18:39] but just remember we're talking about
[18:42] eternal life
[18:43] in eternal life if we are the children
[18:45] of God we have eternal life
[18:48] all right now not that we would just be
[18:51] born naturally of it
[18:53] because we'll get to it after a while
[18:55] where the Prophet said that he breathed
[18:57] into the nostrils of Adam and he became
[18:59] a living Soul he said especially Adam
[19:03] eternal life he said now not what nature
[19:05] done
[19:06] see then the prophet is covering nature
[19:09] as being the life that you and I receive
[19:12] when we were born as children into the
[19:15] world we by Nature receive the life you
[19:19] know from God God's the only creator of
[19:22] life and bringing it but it's more or
[19:24] less by a nature well it's not just the
[19:27] nature of that nature of a nature no
[19:29] it's the nature that the fact that we
[19:32] would come into the world with Mortal
[19:34] life
[19:36] all right and then we'd have to be made
[19:38] Eternal because that way you wouldn't be
[19:40] coming into coming into the world with
[19:42] eternal life because we don't believe in
[19:44] eternal sonship
[19:47] see then that should annihilate the fact
[19:49] of people thinking that they come in the
[19:51] world with eternal life and I'm sorry
[19:54] the only thing that I'm saying to you is
[19:57] I don't believe that
[19:58] I believe you must be born again
[20:01] and that means you receive eternal life
[20:03] here but that eternal life you receive
[20:06] always was eternal and always was a part
[20:09] of God it's God's own life
[20:12] all right and that would bring it in
[20:14] because Jesus Christ wouldn't have to
[20:16] die if you believe in eternal sonship
[20:20] did you get that
[20:22] if you believe in Eternal sonship Jesus
[20:24] Christ don't have to die
[20:26] because you'd just be an eternal son
[20:29] and I don't believe that I believe you
[20:31] have to come through the stages and we
[20:33] will get to that later when we cover the
[20:35] on down through the message of the fall
[20:37] and and the things and seeing just what
[20:41] happened but just watch the point now
[20:44] that we're talking about
[20:48] not just God creating a family
[20:54] see that's what we we've had that
[20:56] thought in our mind that God just
[20:58] created a people and from that people he
[21:01] picked a family
[21:02] yeah well I don't believe it that way
[21:05] I believe God's family
[21:07] is his children and his children
[21:11] the eternal life that we have now always
[21:14] was eternal that's the children of God
[21:17] the children of God are not me and you
[21:19] right
[21:20] we we are the children of our parents
[21:23] brought into the World by Nature
[21:26] you know from natural act Etc and God's
[21:29] supplying a life to live in that human
[21:31] being until we would come to the basis
[21:34] of where we could receive eternal life
[21:36] and make a choice all right now there's
[21:39] another way we keep it to running into
[21:40] straight order so just don't lose me now
[21:43] in the thought if I don't keep referring
[21:46] to it sometimes the mind will drift off
[21:48] of what I'm trying to bring
[21:51] I'm still trying to bring because you'll
[21:53] see that this point this afternoon that
[21:56] we're talking about
[21:58] of let us make God in our own image
[22:01] that that one that was made there
[22:05] was not made like a creation
[22:09] you know just making something
[22:12] god making something
[22:15] no it's God himself unveiling how he
[22:20] comes into being amen all right
[22:23] see not just god making if God makes you
[22:26] a child
[22:27] then you you see foolish virgins will
[22:31] receive eternal life one day but that
[22:34] will not even make them the children of
[22:36] God that will make them with people with
[22:40] eternal life
[22:41] you could call them to Children Of God
[22:43] yeah because of them receiving it but
[22:45] they're not the bride of Christ
[22:48] the bride of Christ is part of God
[22:52] that's why to me it's so wonderful that
[22:54] we'll get to it later where that even in
[22:56] the message today don't lose the point
[22:59] that
[23:02] Adam and Eve
[23:04] Adam was made male and female
[23:07] all right
[23:08] but he was made that in the spiritual
[23:15] as well as the natural
[23:17] right okay
[23:19] now what it means you lost me well
[23:21] no no no I'm reading Bible
[23:25] the one that we read about
[23:28] is male and female created he them right
[23:31] right so then Eve has to be an atom
[23:35] and that's that's word that we have to
[23:36] hold it why because the bride is in
[23:39] Christ
[23:40] right
[23:41] remember
[23:44] we never come here within him and us he
[23:46] came here with us in him
[23:49] that's what I'm concerned about
[23:51] he he didn't come here in this little
[23:53] filthy garbage
[23:55] and he has to do a lot of work before he
[23:56] can use that okay
[24:00] now to try to pick up the thought then
[24:03] so we use this morning to lay down a
[24:06] reference back to our referring to what
[24:10] we've been talking about
[24:12] of God condescending
[24:15] down until he could be revealed
[24:19] and doing that he would do it in a way
[24:23] that would be marvelous you know and it
[24:27] could bring into being you say well I
[24:29] don't know about all this theophany
[24:31] logos it is that the other well we'll
[24:34] just let brother around him say it and
[24:36] then you'll be talking about him first
[24:38] but
[24:41] and see what I'm trying to get you to
[24:43] follow is a lineup of coming of God
[24:45] coming in to where he can be
[24:46] comprehended and this is the revealing
[24:49] of God this is not the god coming down
[24:52] he goes down here then he goes down here
[24:55] and he goes down here no see you got to
[25:00] express it
[25:02] but it's the condescending or revealing
[25:05] of himself as he comes downward to us
[25:10] for you and I to be able to understand
[25:12] him because how would we understand him
[25:15] as it used to be
[25:17] it's not been for the prophet of God and
[25:19] and God using him to express these
[25:21] things
[25:22] we had what the scholar said
[25:25] they had what they said
[25:28] they knew the wordings
[25:31] but it's just like Scofield he gets all
[25:33] of the things but then he turns out with
[25:34] an eternal sonship
[25:36] and he said he don't believe in and he
[25:38] turned himself you know but he brings it
[25:40] down as to being that
[25:43] see they couldn't get it together
[25:46] it took a profit for God to reveal his
[25:49] word to
[25:50] all right then following his line we can
[25:53] see where we're at
[25:55] and remember
[25:57] my point is it's not you and I coming
[26:00] into being
[26:04] that's only the part that goes with it
[26:08] it's God revealing himself
[26:12] as he comes into
[26:15] um eyesight spiritually speaking
[26:19] then we can comprehend him
[26:21] this is the revealing of God
[26:25] man all right then once you see it
[26:27] then you can see his offspring
[26:30] is a part of him
[26:32] so in this day if God is being revealed
[26:34] he's also going to be revealed in his
[26:37] bride
[26:40] and the prophet said she's the fullness
[26:42] of the godhead bodily
[26:44] like Masterpiece and like what is it the
[26:47] Mighty God unveiled
[26:50] that the bride will be the fullness of
[26:51] the godhead bodily
[26:54] all right
[26:56] but see we want it as trying to say the
[26:58] other night we want it at a point
[27:00] as to we try to make it we can draw out
[27:03] things
[27:05] there's no way
[27:07] to draw out
[27:10] because I told you nothing I'm not
[27:11] against anybody but I told you about the
[27:13] brother that had this drawing and had
[27:15] this thing made and he had lights and
[27:17] fixed and he had gone back here
[27:19] self-existing and then he just moved all
[27:22] of that over into here
[27:25] and he said there was the logos the
[27:27] theophany
[27:28] ETC the Creator and all and then he
[27:30] moved all of that over into Christ and
[27:33] then moved it into the bride well he
[27:35] just erased everything back there
[27:38] I don't see it that way
[27:41] if I'm wrong I'm wrong I'll tell you I
[27:43] just don't see it I see them that God
[27:46] moving over into another form enhances
[27:48] the form that he came from
[27:51] never how you want to say it
[27:53] it just makes that greater
[27:56] one because it's bringing into being
[27:59] this great one
[28:01] that's manifesting himself
[28:04] because like I said if you say oh
[28:06] brother Dale oh God
[28:09] was in Christ I've heard lengthy sermons
[28:12] don't have you
[28:14] and they say see that ain't none left of
[28:17] God because all God's in Christ
[28:20] what are you trying to do
[28:23] you say that sounds real good but now
[28:25] what about the next one when you say oh
[28:27] Christ in the church
[28:28] he doesn't done away with Christ with
[28:31] God and now you only got to church
[28:35] now that ain't what they're doing
[28:45] why you want to race out things
[28:51] have you ever heard him where it would
[28:52] keep increasing
[28:54] no it's always decreasing
[28:59] no I'm going the other way
[29:02] I want to go that way don't you
[29:05] you know how I go that away
[29:07] is for him to come this way
[29:10] if he don't come here we don't go there
[29:12] Rapture is not an automatic process of
[29:14] just
[29:15] we fly through the sky
[29:17] it's a group of people on Earth who
[29:20] realize who they are and what they're
[29:22] doing here
[29:25] and that God himself condescends
[29:29] but see when I make statements people
[29:31] say oh you're just doing it
[29:34] when it says all
[29:38] all of God put into Christ
[29:43] he's just done away with God then
[29:47] well the prophet said all
[29:50] and all means all
[29:53] well
[29:57] I just don't believe that one
[30:00] I believe all that God is going to
[30:04] reveal
[30:06] upon this Earth
[30:08] was in Jesus Christ
[30:12] but I don't believe that was all of God
[30:18] well can I quote the prophet
[30:23] he said he would give us a message of
[30:25] cheer down to the endless ages after
[30:28] this world was over with
[30:31] so evidently all of God is Not revealed
[30:33] down here
[30:37] I'd think about that
[30:40] but you see the all God is going to make
[30:42] known says together is made known
[30:44] Through the Bible to you and I but that
[30:47] doesn't finish God
[30:49] that only puts you and I into a position
[30:51] that we can understand God
[30:54] the veil will be lifted from her eyes
[30:57] and we'll see him as he is but what does
[30:59] the Bible say
[31:01] because we'll be like him
[31:04] that's what the scripture said
[31:08] but you see that's what I'm trying to
[31:09] get us to follow so don't lose that
[31:11] thought
[31:14] so as I said we preached this morning
[31:15] this afternoon let's read a little
[31:18] so the prophet of God brought it through
[31:20] and he told us that
[31:23] out of God
[31:25] he said came the logos
[31:30] the speech
[31:33] he calls it the Holy Spirit
[31:35] he calls it as theophany
[31:40] and he begins to say Let There Be
[31:42] in the world and all of the things are
[31:44] created and all of them are created as
[31:47] we said this morning by Jesus Christ
[31:52] so that must have been the form of God
[31:53] back there amen
[31:58] right
[31:59] was Jesus Christ not Jesus the flesh
[32:04] the Christ
[32:05] that's why when he asked Peter Peter
[32:08] never said you're you're Jesus
[32:11] he said who the man say hi to son of man
[32:13] now he said Thou Art the Christ
[32:15] he didn't say Jesus
[32:17] Thou Art the Christ
[32:21] it's because he knew different from that
[32:24] he knew to look at that flesh he's
[32:25] Nebuchadnezzar did and would say the son
[32:28] of God
[32:31] that would be fine
[32:32] but he wouldn't be looking at him as to
[32:34] see it in him as
[32:36] almighty God in the you know the form
[32:38] that's reflect it was another form
[32:40] so keep that in mind when the prophet of
[32:42] God said it's just God in another form
[32:45] he said it's part of God he said not
[32:47] like an arm going off
[32:50] you know or something like that he said
[32:52] it's a part of God
[32:54] the logos that came out from God was a
[32:57] part of God not a part like well brother
[33:00] Dale uh how much of that part came out
[33:03] was it two-thirds or was it a third or
[33:06] was it three quarters or was it
[33:12] just remember the way your Prophet
[33:14] expresses it
[33:15] he said one Speck of eternal life
[33:21] is just as much God as all as God
[33:25] he said like a spoonful of water out of
[33:30] the ocean
[33:31] is the same as the ocean he said it's
[33:34] just not the volume right
[33:38] all right
[33:41] so we're talking about Jesus Christ
[33:44] Colossians 1 John 1 Hebrews 1.
[33:48] and I say Ephesians 3 and 9 I see the
[33:50] letter James 3 and 9. we're talking
[33:52] about all
[33:54] that was created by Jesus Christ
[33:57] all right
[33:58] so who was that creator that stepped out
[34:00] and said let there be Jesus Christ
[34:06] why would you use Jesus Christ don't run
[34:08] around them dead
[34:10] and the main reason I do is because
[34:12] Jesus is the only name God ever had
[34:15] that is his name
[34:18] so is it any problem
[34:21] will say in his full name Jesus Christ
[34:26] because that's the only name God ever
[34:27] had the only name he has now is Jesus
[34:31] that's why you are not our Miss Jesus
[34:33] well I just don't know his name's god
[34:36] well now you're right back where we
[34:38] started at
[34:39] God is an object of worship right
[34:41] so now you've you went all the way
[34:43] around flocked back to where you was
[34:46] get it down and get it into right order
[34:48] and sometimes God will reveal itself
[34:50] from that
[34:51] because that's the only thing I can do
[34:54] all right
[34:55] now
[34:57] so we see the Halo of the light coming
[34:59] out and seeing to let there be
[35:01] we'll take that as being the Christ
[35:04] we'll take that as be in the Holy Spirit
[35:07] because the prophet will use it in a
[35:09] little bit
[35:09] and we'll talk about it as the theophany
[35:11] we'll talk about it as a logos
[35:14] we'll talk about that as God amorphy
[35:18] changing his form not another God
[35:23] the same God in another form
[35:28] all right you think about it
[35:31] the same God in another form and watch
[35:33] why the prophet will use these
[35:35] and you'll see why it'll come down to us
[35:38] the word theophany means the body of God
[35:40] is a springing this morning
[35:43] well wouldn't that be what came out
[35:49] the body of God
[35:51] step forth from God
[35:54] the logos would be the speech that would
[35:56] be in that body
[35:58] and it would all be the Holy Spirit
[36:03] but but you're just making him too real
[36:05] oh I'm going I wish I could make him so
[36:08] real until you'd scream at seeing how
[36:10] real he is
[36:13] you mean he created us
[36:16] and we think we're something real
[36:21] we're a product of him
[36:23] where did he get as the prophet said the
[36:25] sand and the dust and the stuff to make
[36:27] the world from
[36:30] right we can't make dust or sand we
[36:32] could take a rock and grind it up but
[36:34] you know what I'm talking about we can't
[36:35] create it but he could create
[36:42] he could bring it into being
[36:44] one of these days I might get brave
[36:45] enough to preach a little bit further on
[36:47] some of the things my brother Reynolds
[36:49] said the seed was laying in his Earth
[36:53] from another civilization or something
[36:56] you ever heard that quote
[37:01] and let's don't go into all them
[37:02] pre-existent worlds
[37:07] all right because that's in the
[37:09] doctrines of the land that other worlds
[37:11] was created more than just this and
[37:13] other people were created and all these
[37:15] planets out there has got the same thing
[37:17] going that's going on this one
[37:19] I don't believe it I believe this is the
[37:21] core
[37:22] this is it
[37:24] but just think about it now
[37:27] think about God condescending he comes
[37:30] down see to be the speech the logos
[37:35] and then he's at dire and bringing forth
[37:39] and he can speak
[37:43] he could speak and say Let There Be
[37:45] all right now
[37:48] as he would be coming down
[37:51] you realize that
[37:53] this is what I'm hoping you don't never
[37:54] lose since we got into it
[37:56] see that when he changed his form
[38:01] you started coming toward
[38:07] it was not just bringing itself forward
[38:09] he was bringing you forth amen but just
[38:12] remember the parties bringing you
[38:13] forward now it's not the body spirit so
[38:15] you're looking at it it's the eternal
[38:18] life
[38:19] that's within him
[38:22] that's why John says the seed remaineth
[38:24] in us and he cannot sin the prophet says
[38:26] we sin every day
[38:27] what is it it can't sin the seed
[38:31] that remaineth in us the god that lives
[38:35] within us is the one that cannot sin
[38:37] all right
[38:40] let's see watch it now as it he come
[38:42] down then you'll see we come down
[38:46] but not we as peoples
[38:48] or identities we're in him amen
[38:53] that's what I said did the prophet say
[38:54] that when Jesus Christ walked the shores
[38:56] of Galilee he said within him
[39:00] he said I was here when Moses crossed
[39:02] the Red Sea he said I was with Abraham
[39:08] well
[39:10] did it mean the dirt was off the ground
[39:13] not exactly
[39:15] so Jesus didn't come off of dirt come
[39:18] off the ground
[39:20] you come from the original where God
[39:22] said let there be in the world come into
[39:24] being he said let there be and a baby
[39:26] came into being in the womb of a mother
[39:29] not putting potassium calciums and stuff
[39:31] together a creation
[39:35] yep
[39:37] so then watching him
[39:39] condescending
[39:42] then we can see easily why he would say
[39:45] in Genesis
[39:48] that
[39:51] after it created the world after he
[39:53] created the the uh the things now I'm
[39:57] going to the one it's going to fall this
[39:59] way in this way so follow with me and
[40:01] listen
[40:03] it's odd that it comes over in the sixth
[40:06] day
[40:07] and then he speaks of let us make man
[40:12] but that was the natural man that we'll
[40:14] get to later of Adam
[40:18] this man that's being created here in
[40:21] Genesis 1 26 and 27 is not Adam
[40:25] it's Christ
[40:29] is Christ
[40:31] coming into big
[40:33] it's not Adam
[40:39] had a beginning
[40:43] Adam was a standing the prophet said
[40:44] with his feet tongue into the dirt
[40:47] standing there he said didn't God
[40:50] breathe into his nostril's eternal life
[40:54] into Adam
[40:56] but you remember one thing
[40:59] when you and I come into the world as
[41:00] babies there wasn't no breathing of
[41:03] eternal life the key to that is to
[41:05] understand what I've tried to say God
[41:08] never begins any creation as a baby
[41:16] Adam was a full-grown man
[41:19] the church started on the day of
[41:21] Pentecost as a full-grown Church
[41:26] Jesus Christ came as a baby to show what
[41:28] we were going to come as babies
[41:32] when he come to a full-grown man
[41:34] all right
[41:36] but see now as it comes to Genesis then
[41:39] think about it that the prophet of God
[41:41] said
[41:42] on the who's this Melchizedek will read
[41:45] the minute or maybe
[41:46] and there's about three quotes four
[41:49] that man was created on the sixth day
[41:52] that shouldn't be no argument
[41:54] even though you read it in Genesis and
[41:57] then you jump one and then you jump over
[41:59] to two and chapter two if you'll notice
[42:03] it says in verse 4 of chapter 2 these
[42:07] are the generations of the heavens and
[42:09] the earth when they were created in the
[42:12] day that the Lord God made the earth and
[42:15] the heavens the generations in other
[42:17] words repeating
[42:20] what he had done
[42:22] it took chapter 1 to bring chapter 2
[42:25] into being
[42:27] so now keep in mind what you're looking
[42:29] at the physical Man was created on the
[42:32] sixth day
[42:33] God rested the Sabbath that's what the
[42:36] Bible says
[42:37] all right but this man that we're
[42:39] talking about
[42:42] of let us make man in our own image
[42:47] that man had no beginning
[42:51] that man was created before the world
[42:53] ever was created
[42:55] we've been through all of that proving
[42:57] it coming down the Morning Star saying
[42:59] together and the sons of God shouted for
[43:01] joy
[43:06] then
[43:07] this man that we're talking about today
[43:10] in the image of God was not created on
[43:13] the sixth day
[43:14] amen the physical man
[43:18] of Genesis 2 was created on the sixth
[43:21] day Genesis 2 is a recap of what
[43:25] happened in the Genesis 1. all right
[43:30] now so we're going back still before the
[43:33] foundation of the world
[43:36] right we're still back tires you want to
[43:37] call it in the mind of God
[43:40] no we haven't been through that right to
[43:42] be in the mind of God means to be part
[43:44] of God Amen
[43:47] not something God thought of
[43:50] says what we think we think God's
[43:52] sitting there well I think maybe I might
[43:53] have kids
[43:54] no
[43:56] from any time of any thoughts you could
[43:58] have a concept in your mind of a God he
[44:01] had the attributes within him that's
[44:03] what your Prophet said
[44:05] he said he had the attributes of Savior
[44:07] healer
[44:09] before there was anything
[44:11] he never gained attributes coming this
[44:14] way he just displayed those attributes
[44:18] and it would come forth into a being as
[44:21] we call it
[44:24] and we dwelt on creation and being
[44:28] because we we knew that that's a concept
[44:31] in our mind when we see the word being
[44:34] or beginning
[44:37] that we think of nothing and then
[44:39] something
[44:41] in creation we think of whatever is
[44:44] creating it
[44:47] remember that's for the world
[44:49] and all the other things
[44:52] but this man I'm talking about in
[44:54] Genesis 1 26 and 27 they will try to
[44:57] prove from the prophet
[44:59] and no beginning
[45:02] he had no ending
[45:07] it's God himself
[45:10] and we'll get to it worth it we think
[45:11] well he just created Adam
[45:14] he didn't just create Adam in 126. he
[45:16] created Adam into
[45:19] over the second chapter
[45:21] all right that's the physical atom the
[45:24] first man Adam
[45:28] and Eve
[45:30] at no beginning
[45:35] no starting point
[45:39] because we're still talking about
[45:41] eternal life
[45:45] eternal life has no beginning In The
[45:47] Wind into it it can't it can't start
[45:50] so when you come to Christ
[45:52] you can understand
[45:55] we'll get to it it's in the notes here
[45:58] he said he didn't make man hey man if
[46:02] you'll notice in there he's actually
[46:03] really spelling it out
[46:07] that wasn't what he made in Genesis 1.
[46:09] he didn't make amen just like One
[46:12] Singular
[46:13] he made man
[46:16] and to show you that even our
[46:17] terminologies of life is when you say
[46:21] manned or mankind what does it refer to
[46:26] you don't have to say women right
[46:29] man or mankind refers to male and female
[46:33] right so God is right in his
[46:35] understanding
[46:37] he's going to make man
[46:39] not just a man singular
[46:43] he's going to make man
[46:46] all right
[46:47] then as he does then you can see that we
[46:51] we are coming into being
[46:54] at the same time he's coming in to be
[46:56] but the we that's coming in to be into
[46:58] eternal life you know us
[47:00] not us as people get that away from your
[47:02] mind
[47:05] no it's a spiritual creation so we'll
[47:07] let him do it let's go ahead and start
[47:09] now
[47:12] we're going to start
[47:14] about
[47:16] the middle of our notes these brothers
[47:19] had these notes for quite a while and
[47:20] you see what I've done with them
[47:23] but on the message guilty of sin
[47:26] and the penalty that caused to read Sin
[47:28] from our lives
[47:30] 53 403
[47:32] we start in paragraph 51.
[47:35] all right 50 48 up to there is talking
[47:38] about the little Halo
[47:40] and the things you know and God coming
[47:42] forth we read them the other day and how
[47:46] the icebergs formed and caused Mexico
[47:48] caused the Great Cuts in the earth and
[47:51] the things coming down
[47:52] and how he's creating the world
[47:56] and then he covers it like this right at
[47:58] the lights then he created all creation
[48:01] and after he had made it all the trees
[48:03] come up the plants and so forth what a
[48:06] beautiful setting he had he loved it it
[48:09] was beautiful he thought it was fine all
[48:12] right now he's talking about the natural
[48:14] creation
[48:16] okay so we're starting here with another
[48:19] creation right
[48:22] so he couldn't just leave it in that
[48:24] state
[48:25] he had to leave something with it so he
[48:27] said let us plural make man plural
[48:30] in our own image
[48:32] let us make man in our own image so then
[48:35] God made his first man
[48:38] he was a spirit man
[48:41] what
[48:42] this is before the world now this is not
[48:44] Adam physical right
[48:47] right now not Adam physical
[48:50] not the flesh man this is a spirit man
[48:54] it was something on the order of God
[48:57] or the son of God
[49:00] the logos
[49:01] that was the first man
[49:03] and he gave the man dear jurisdiction
[49:06] over
[49:07] the to lead all the animal life
[49:09] just like the Holy Spirit leads a
[49:11] Believer today go here and do this and
[49:13] only if we could be perfect how much we
[49:16] could do all right now we go over to
[49:17] number six
[49:19] bypassing some of the notes that we used
[49:21] this is a message George the father and
[49:24] it'll satisfy us 53 16 e 65.
[49:29] and when he made everything that looked
[49:31] nice and good to him now he said let us
[49:34] rural make man plural in her own image
[49:37] what was he
[49:38] there is is a supernatural being
[49:42] now what's he doing
[49:44] there's the one that could not be seen
[49:48] come on now
[49:50] describing God describing us
[49:53] I know the same paragraph
[49:55] there's one that could not be seen God
[49:57] the father never was seen never will be
[49:59] seen
[50:01] you're not going to see that spirit
[50:03] you're going to see him like he is right
[50:06] he's all nature and there he is and now
[50:08] here's the son
[50:11] which is the logos that went out of him
[50:13] Made In His Image a supernatural being
[50:17] that went out in the beginning
[50:21] let us make manner our own image after
[50:24] after he'd made a man in his own image
[50:26] he made a supernatural being
[50:29] yes indeed Genesis 1 28.
[50:32] because there's where it comes over
[50:34] they're telling you to multiply
[50:37] and I told you now if you keep that
[50:39] correctly we're right
[50:41] you sisters have a right to carry the
[50:45] gospel
[50:48] the the word seed comes through the body
[50:50] right
[50:51] but you sisters even have a right to
[50:53] carry the gospel talk to your neighbors
[50:55] testify to them you know what you're
[50:57] doing
[50:58] we come into the World by spiritual
[51:00] multiplication
[51:03] right
[51:04] into the body of Christ
[51:06] by spiritual multiplication
[51:09] all right so that's why it goes into
[51:11] Genesis 1 20 8 because 128 goes from a
[51:14] natural from spiritual to a natural
[51:16] all right
[51:18] read it and see if that isn't right
[51:21] and then when he made man in his own
[51:23] image he had rule over the Beast he led
[51:25] the Beast around then like the Holy
[51:27] Spirit supposed to lead to church today
[51:29] that's right he led to church around him
[51:31] and then he said there's no man to till
[51:33] the soil you know he's getting to the
[51:35] next man it's two men
[51:36] so he created man Out of the Dust of the
[51:39] Earth
[51:40] you might give him a hand like a monkey
[51:42] and a foot like a Byron I don't know
[51:44] what he did but he put him into five
[51:46] senses
[51:48] now watch he put this supernatural being
[51:52] which was called man
[51:58] oh
[51:59] the third person of the trinity
[52:03] now we know he went no trinitarian
[52:07] what is it holy spirit
[52:13] into mankind
[52:19] what did he put into his Genesis 2 man
[52:23] what he created in Genesis 1 Man
[52:26] the supernatural being
[52:28] the Holy Spirit the Son of God the Lord
[52:32] gosh
[52:33] the one that was to lead the animals he
[52:35] put that finally into flesh right
[52:39] that's exactly right
[52:41] that man and he made him in his own
[52:43] image
[52:44] all right
[52:46] now he made him
[52:51] we talk about a trinity
[52:56] there might be a reason for him saying
[52:58] that in the third
[53:00] third person of the Trinity might be
[53:01] running to you and I but that's all
[53:03] right go ahead to the next one 6A
[53:07] who is God priest in 1950 815 the
[53:12] paragraph 8 20.
[53:15] and then we're going to make this second
[53:17] man
[53:19] now watch him
[53:23] the first man you can't see him
[53:26] God
[53:28] now I remember the other day when we
[53:30] were using it off of the message of
[53:32] Genesis question answers on Genesis
[53:34] paragraph 21
[53:35] where he said God was his first creation
[53:41] and see that's kind of froze some of you
[53:43] on God was his first creation well he's
[53:45] not talking about creating something
[53:48] Iran's not talking about creating
[53:50] somebody's talking about something
[53:51] coming into being
[53:54] not a beginning not a doing it some God
[53:57] always was
[54:00] but his first creation
[54:03] was to look at him and see him as God
[54:05] see him at Elohim whatever we call him
[54:09] then he steps forth to become the logos
[54:13] speech
[54:15] speaking to us so now here he's back on
[54:18] it again
[54:19] now we're going to make this second man
[54:21] the first man you can't see him God
[54:24] second man was a Halo
[54:27] that's your logos theophany right going
[54:30] out of God the Holy Spirit
[54:32] and now he takes a third man
[54:36] and makes him like a little white cloud
[54:42] coming over we can see him Holy Spirit
[54:45] coming down
[54:47] right
[54:48] and he's all man that's the soul of man
[54:53] Eternal then
[55:01] first man is God can't be seen second
[55:04] man is the logos theophany
[55:06] Etc of the things we've read about it
[55:10] the third party's bringing man let us
[55:12] make man
[55:14] in our own image
[55:16] or on likeness let them have dominion
[55:18] over the Earth bring it down to what to
[55:21] that's that's the soul of man he says
[55:26] Eternal then
[55:30] that man that came out from God as the
[55:32] Genesis 123 whatever you want to do or
[55:35] argue or fuss about
[55:37] remember it was a spiritual man it was
[55:41] not a physical man it was a spiritual
[55:43] being it was the theophany the logos
[55:48] the Holy Spirit
[55:56] so the first man
[55:58] of the Genesis 1 26 man
[56:01] that man
[56:04] is the Christ amen
[56:07] amen
[56:10] there's only one Christ
[56:14] there's only one logos
[56:18] there's only one theophany
[56:21] he's going to wait just a minute now
[56:22] there's a theophany to the center that's
[56:24] what I'm talking about that's the body
[56:26] of a god he's going his way
[56:30] there's only one eternal
[56:33] there's only one eternal theophany
[56:36] there's only one Genesis 126 man
[56:39] and that's Christ
[56:43] amen there's how he was in God
[56:47] right
[56:49] that's how he was in God then we get
[56:52] marred we won't go through it we'll
[56:53] cover that in the next message
[56:56] but let's go on for just a little
[57:01] let's just think about this man
[57:03] listen to the things the prophet calls
[57:05] him in doing
[57:07] go ahead to the questions and answers on
[57:09] Genesis
[57:13] 53 729 paragraph 13.
[57:16] and they asked him a question what does
[57:18] this Genesis 1 26 have to do with
[57:21] Genesis 2 7.
[57:23] all right
[57:25] God created two men that's their
[57:27] question their thought and that's true
[57:30] and which was the man and which what
[57:32] connection does that have what how does
[57:35] it connect up in the scripture well if
[57:37] you'll notice close now in Genesis 1 26
[57:39] let's get to first part first God said
[57:42] let us and let us us in is a let us make
[57:47] manner on image of course we realize
[57:49] he's talking to someone
[57:54] he's speaking to another being
[57:58] oh that's Trinity
[58:03] um
[58:04] I can show you where brother random said
[58:06] he's talking to the animals
[58:09] if you want that that's natural
[58:13] well
[58:15] would you ever think about maybe we were
[58:17] wondering how we were going to come
[58:22] it's up to you
[58:23] let us make man in our own image after
[58:25] our likeness and let them have dominion
[58:28] over the cattle to the field
[58:30] if you notice in creation the first
[58:32] thing that was created of course was
[58:33] light you come on down through the
[58:35] creation the last thing was created was
[58:37] what a man
[58:39] and the woman was made after the man
[58:42] all right the first last thing that was
[58:45] created of God's creation is mankind but
[58:48] when God made his first man if you
[58:51] notice he made him in the likeness of
[58:53] himself
[58:54] he was made in the image of God and
[58:57] that's what God is now
[58:59] and what God is now excuse me if you can
[59:02] find out what God is
[59:05] we can find out what kind of a man he
[59:08] made
[59:09] right right
[59:12] because you made a news image image
[59:14] means likeness
[59:15] and likeness there doesn't mean just as
[59:18] I said you take two identical twins
[59:21] June used to take care of two little
[59:24] girls
[59:25] I couldn't tell them apart
[59:28] they said after a while you can find a
[59:29] little bitty thing but I know regardless
[59:32] of the best could be there would be
[59:33] something somewhere
[59:35] that would not be totally identical
[59:38] because they are two different people
[59:40] you know all right but see image
[59:46] doesn't mean the words in your image
[59:49] that's fine but no we don't look exactly
[59:53] alike
[59:55] we're different heights we're different
[59:57] things
[59:58] that's not that word image
[1:00:01] and then Colossians you'll find out that
[1:00:03] he's the image of the invisible God
[1:00:09] all right God changed his form it says
[1:00:11] they're in Colossians we used the other
[1:00:13] day
[1:00:14] in the form of God
[1:00:18] see Jesus taught it not robbery
[1:00:21] to be equal to God you know why
[1:00:24] because he was God that's that's why I
[1:00:27] never thought robbery to be equal he was
[1:00:30] God he was in God's image he was in
[1:00:32] God's likeness you want to know what God
[1:00:34] looks like look at Jesus
[1:00:36] all right
[1:00:38] now
[1:00:40] so when you're getting down to that what
[1:00:41] are you doing
[1:00:45] you're going to come and bring man into
[1:00:47] being let's go on with this questions
[1:00:50] and answers
[1:00:51] on Genesis
[1:00:54] I got 43.
[1:00:56] you got all those things together and
[1:00:58] made all the other things all the animal
[1:01:00] life the birds the bees the monkeys and
[1:01:03] whatever it was put them all here on
[1:01:04] Earth
[1:01:05] and then he asked this question
[1:01:07] let us who father and son
[1:01:10] now that's who he's talking to while ago
[1:01:14] when he said speaking to another being
[1:01:20] father and son
[1:01:25] are you with me
[1:01:29] father was the great eternal
[1:01:33] could not be seen we read the quote
[1:01:41] another form comes forth
[1:01:43] called a son
[1:01:47] right oh gosh they offney Holy Spirit
[1:01:50] God in another form same God
[1:01:56] it's another form
[1:01:58] to reveal himself now he's coming to
[1:02:00] reveal himself in mankind
[1:02:03] in another form
[1:02:05] all right
[1:02:07] let us who Father and Son you want to
[1:02:10] call it word and spirit
[1:02:14] that's okay
[1:02:17] word can be here and spirit over here
[1:02:20] and they're not one
[1:02:22] right but when the word is revealed the
[1:02:26] word in spirit of one
[1:02:28] right
[1:02:30] so there's no problem with it there's no
[1:02:32] Trinity
[1:02:34] no secret coding
[1:02:37] so let us who Father and Son make manner
[1:02:40] their own image
[1:02:42] if a man was made something like that
[1:02:44] little sacred light Yonder
[1:02:46] or something like that
[1:02:49] it could not be seen all right which is
[1:02:52] a spiritual being
[1:02:54] he manifested or unfolded himself a
[1:02:58] little more to make a trinity of himself
[1:03:00] a father Son and Holy Spirit
[1:03:04] and here was God unfolding himself now
[1:03:08] down into
[1:03:11] now you probably thought of a long while
[1:03:14] ago when I was saying I'm talking about
[1:03:16] the coming forth to God so listen
[1:03:21] and I was God unfolding himself down
[1:03:24] into
[1:03:27] so the unfolding and this man coming
[1:03:29] forth is God himself
[1:03:34] no that was man
[1:03:37] God himself in another form
[1:03:42] called a man
[1:03:44] okay
[1:03:46] unfolding himself down into let us make
[1:03:48] man
[1:03:49] which was his son an offspring of him
[1:03:52] man in our own image he was a
[1:03:55] supernatural being and let him have
[1:03:56] dominion over the cattle of the field
[1:03:58] and so forth now the man LED that
[1:04:01] let the man led the cattle and
[1:04:04] everything just like the Holy Spirit
[1:04:06] leads a True Believer today the voice of
[1:04:09] God out of there
[1:04:13] whose voice was leading the animals
[1:04:16] Adam's voice
[1:04:19] as the
[1:04:22] logos theophany speech
[1:04:25] who spoke to the bull in this day
[1:04:31] God's voice to a man because the man
[1:04:33] that said it was brother Branham but the
[1:04:36] man that said it said if I'd have had my
[1:04:38] gun I would have shot that bull
[1:04:42] and went and paid for him
[1:04:44] you don't read them
[1:04:47] see the man that was standing there was
[1:04:49] a scared
[1:04:50] he'd have shocked above but he left his
[1:04:52] gun remember laying in the truck
[1:04:55] but something took over from inside of
[1:04:57] him and the bull obeyed that from inside
[1:05:02] right
[1:05:03] come on now
[1:05:06] the voice of God I was there the voice
[1:05:07] of man read it with speaking say call
[1:05:11] the cattle this way or call the Sheep
[1:05:12] over this faster call the Fish to this
[1:05:14] water see he had Dominion everything
[1:05:16] obeyed him noticed then there was no man
[1:05:19] to tell the soil Genesis 2 no man to
[1:05:22] till the soil and then God formed man
[1:05:24] Genesis 2 7 out of the Earth to the
[1:05:26] earth now we follow it he formed Man Out
[1:05:29] of the Dust of the earth and put this
[1:05:31] Supernatural spirit
[1:05:35] he formed a man and then put that in him
[1:05:37] which if we have time we'll get down to
[1:05:39] that
[1:05:41] and he was laying there
[1:05:43] he said I got some pictures I can see
[1:05:44] Adam standing let's take this see him
[1:05:46] standing like a tree God had made him
[1:05:49] now he's talking about a physical body
[1:05:50] right he was dead as he could be he's
[1:05:53] told like the roots sticking in the
[1:05:55] ground and God said let there be or
[1:05:58] breathe the breath of life into him any
[1:06:02] jump came to life see him came to
[1:06:05] himself
[1:06:07] see he was a breather Breath of Life
[1:06:09] into him he became a living soul
[1:06:14] now he begins to move
[1:06:16] now you got the man in the garden
[1:06:20] that was in glory
[1:06:23] in the first creation
[1:06:25] you got him in physical creation
[1:06:29] and it's the soul of man
[1:06:33] shoulders a lot more to us than just
[1:06:35] well brother Dale I remember yeah I
[1:06:37] don't know what you remember you
[1:06:38] remember the two Soul Doctrine
[1:06:41] and I've told you before they couldn't
[1:06:43] even read
[1:06:46] I've heard it preached sermon after
[1:06:48] sermon the soul is just the nature of
[1:06:50] the spirit I want one quote from Brother
[1:06:52] random where it said the soul is just
[1:06:54] the nature of the spirit
[1:06:59] but around said the soul is the Nature's
[1:07:01] pure when they put the word just in
[1:07:03] there they're interpreted it as being
[1:07:05] something that it wasn't or just making
[1:07:06] the shoulders well it's just nothing
[1:07:08] it's just a soldiers to Nature it's just
[1:07:11] a flopping around it's just a nature
[1:07:13] soul is what you are amen
[1:07:18] thank God for Hebrews
[1:07:20] to divide between Soul and Spirit
[1:07:23] thank God for a prophet
[1:07:27] and a man that would even in his early
[1:07:28] Ministry
[1:07:30] sometimes interchange Soul and Spirit
[1:07:35] but when he would come into the life of
[1:07:37] his ministry
[1:07:38] he would deal with the soul as the
[1:07:40] inward part of man
[1:07:43] he didn't have to correct anything
[1:07:45] because he wasn't wrong
[1:07:48] I've been through that with you he
[1:07:50] always gave what three parts of man
[1:07:53] right he always gave the outside she
[1:07:56] takes feel smelling here no matter what
[1:07:58] he called it he gave the second Rim
[1:08:00] memory reason conscience Etc
[1:08:02] he called that Spirit he'd call that
[1:08:04] soul
[1:08:05] because that's the interchangeable word
[1:08:07] even of the Hebrew and Greek
[1:08:09] understanding of the word Soul and
[1:08:12] Spirit
[1:08:14] moved
[1:08:17] you got to see whether it's talking
[1:08:18] about the spirit of God or the spirit of
[1:08:21] man
[1:08:23] well see he always gave the center part
[1:08:25] of man one sense
[1:08:27] Faith or doubt
[1:08:29] so he was always correct he just had his
[1:08:31] wording
[1:08:32] in a different place but yet he was
[1:08:34] right in what he would be saying a lot
[1:08:36] of times
[1:08:38] one because he'd be referring to the
[1:08:39] real you
[1:08:42] your soul is more real than your body
[1:08:44] and your spirit
[1:08:46] you want scripture it's the soul that
[1:08:48] sinneth that shall die not the spirit of
[1:08:51] body
[1:08:53] the soul that sent us the scripture says
[1:08:55] shall die
[1:08:56] soul is what's going to be judged
[1:08:59] because that's the real you
[1:09:02] all right
[1:09:06] deep breath into him he began to move
[1:09:09] all right
[1:09:14] put this Supernatural in him
[1:09:17] all right you don't have to give the
[1:09:18] next one it's
[1:09:20] um
[1:09:22] paragraph 158 who is this Melchizedek
[1:09:25] Man was created on the sixth day
[1:09:28] just to where you won't have the the
[1:09:30] understanding and get lost in it
[1:09:32] that too is this male Chestnut
[1:09:35] Zoom down
[1:09:36] Man was created on the sixth day
[1:09:39] seven is God's number all right now
[1:09:42] let's think about something
[1:09:46] let's think about something he called
[1:09:48] this
[1:09:49] man
[1:09:52] we've read he called him the Holy Spirit
[1:09:56] he called him the logos
[1:10:00] he called in the spirit of God
[1:10:02] call him a son of God
[1:10:06] all right
[1:10:08] yep now
[1:10:11] look at the point of what he's talking
[1:10:12] about from
[1:10:14] Hebrews chapter 3 going to number nine
[1:10:20] somebody stop that clock
[1:10:23] paragraph 278.
[1:10:26] now the logos that went out of God
[1:10:30] which was the logos all this being
[1:10:32] deformed into a body shape and this body
[1:10:34] of shape was called in the scholars
[1:10:36] teaching logos the logos that went out
[1:10:39] of God
[1:10:40] in other words a better word for it
[1:10:43] was what we call it theophany
[1:10:47] the often is a human body that's
[1:10:49] glorified not as black or Flesh and
[1:10:51] Blood like it will be in the glorified
[1:10:52] state
[1:10:54] but it's in the form of a human body
[1:10:55] that doesn't eat neither does it drink
[1:10:59] but it's it's a body a body that's
[1:11:01] waiting for us as soon as we leave this
[1:11:03] one all right now in in Corinthians
[1:11:06] second Corinthians 5 I think it is
[1:11:10] we're talking of the
[1:11:13] theophany
[1:11:15] it says we have one waiting in Heavens
[1:11:18] eternal
[1:11:22] now do we have an eternal
[1:11:24] theophany
[1:11:26] up in heaven
[1:11:29] waiting on us to get there
[1:11:31] that's what everybody preaches
[1:11:34] everybody preaches I'm going one day to
[1:11:37] my theophany
[1:11:39] and they sing in songs you know
[1:11:42] not throwing off them sounds beautiful
[1:11:45] don't off on our understanding
[1:11:48] do we have an eternal theophany in
[1:11:50] heaven
[1:11:53] and we have eternal life in our soul
[1:12:02] what is the soul of man
[1:12:06] now if we can prove the soul of man is a
[1:12:08] theophany
[1:12:10] you go out of time together
[1:12:14] and remember I wouldn't have went and
[1:12:15] said it and brother Brandon wouldn't
[1:12:17] even know what said it
[1:12:19] the angel of the Lord speaking to him
[1:12:21] when he was beyond the curtain of time
[1:12:22] when the people were coming up
[1:12:24] he said this is what is written in the
[1:12:27] scripture sold under the altar
[1:12:31] the angel of the Lord could call them
[1:12:33] Souls it was there brother Bradham was
[1:12:35] there not in their physical body he was
[1:12:37] there in his soul
[1:12:39] Jesus Christ will read in a minute went
[1:12:42] to hell in his soul his theophany
[1:12:45] his logos he's person of his being
[1:12:52] well come back on the death Pentecost
[1:12:55] well the Holy Ghost came down
[1:12:58] amen
[1:12:59] what was that Holy Ghost
[1:13:02] we just read some quotes where the Holy
[1:13:05] Spirit the logos
[1:13:07] and the Son of God Was the Same
[1:13:12] so what came onto that Pentecost
[1:13:17] just remember the anointing came on
[1:13:19] Jesus on the River Jordan
[1:13:22] make it in the fullness of the godhead
[1:13:24] model him okay
[1:13:25] but remember that anointing left him in
[1:13:27] the Garden of Gethsemane
[1:13:30] that's what your Prophet said
[1:13:35] that was an anointing for his ministry
[1:13:38] but he still had to die to give up the
[1:13:40] holy ghost that was inside of him or his
[1:13:42] soul
[1:13:44] had to come out of his body to be able
[1:13:46] to come to you and I am
[1:13:47] en that's why anointed once can be
[1:13:49] anointed all right
[1:13:51] so let's think about it
[1:13:57] the logos that went out of God
[1:14:00] a bodily shape we'll call it the logos
[1:14:02] in other words a better word for it is
[1:14:04] we call it a theophany
[1:14:08] which is a human body that's glorified
[1:14:14] now
[1:14:16] he has no problem with Son of God logos
[1:14:18] theophany Holy Spirit
[1:14:22] do we
[1:14:26] do we know what the Plan of Salvation
[1:14:28] really is go ahead with the next one
[1:14:33] all right
[1:14:42] remember what he was saying about
[1:14:44] paragraph 70 at 278 this is 279 that
[1:14:48] followers to where we're just on 278.
[1:14:52] now when Man became into that body
[1:14:57] roll that down brother let's make sure
[1:14:59] you understand the connection between
[1:15:01] the two roll it back down just a little
[1:15:03] bit
[1:15:04] all right
[1:15:08] do you have needs a human body that's
[1:15:10] glorified not exactly reflection blood
[1:15:11] like we'll be in the glorified state but
[1:15:13] it is a form of a human body that
[1:15:15] doesn't eat neither does it drink
[1:15:17] beyond the curtain of time they did not
[1:15:19] eat and drink but they were their in
[1:15:22] bodies he could feel them
[1:15:24] they could talk to him that was the soul
[1:15:27] but it's a body a body that's waiting
[1:15:29] for us as soon as we leave this one now
[1:15:31] and there we enter into that body that's
[1:15:33] the kind of body that God was
[1:15:36] for he said let us make man in our own
[1:15:37] image and our own likeness and when Man
[1:15:39] became into that body
[1:15:42] theophany
[1:15:47] he had control of the fishes the fowls
[1:15:50] the beasts of the field
[1:15:53] and there was no man to till the soil
[1:15:58] Genesis 2. he done made the male and
[1:16:01] female
[1:16:03] but there's no man to fill the soil
[1:16:06] don't forget that
[1:16:09] he had done made male and female
[1:16:12] all right
[1:16:13] it made God made man out of the dusted
[1:16:16] the Earth
[1:16:17] he gave him a hand like a chimpanzee
[1:16:19] give him foot like a bar he gave him
[1:16:21] made him on the image
[1:16:23] and this Earthly body is in the image of
[1:16:26] animal life
[1:16:30] and it's made out of the same kind of
[1:16:31] material
[1:16:33] okay
[1:16:35] now
[1:16:40] look at what he's coming to
[1:16:46] made out of the same kind of material
[1:16:50] I'm trying to find it here
[1:16:52] it's made out of calcium potassium thing
[1:16:55] how the dusted Earth where it come from
[1:16:57] now look what he says
[1:16:59] but the difference between an animal and
[1:17:02] a man
[1:17:05] God put a soul in a man
[1:17:09] you remember this morning we were
[1:17:11] talking about the animal life couldn't
[1:17:12] atone for sin
[1:17:14] it could cover
[1:17:15] until Christ came but it couldn't
[1:17:18] eradicate sin
[1:17:20] when Jesus Christ gave me eradicated
[1:17:22] never between a man and an animal God
[1:17:25] put a soul in a man he didn't put it in
[1:17:27] the animal because the soul that was in
[1:17:29] the man is that theophany
[1:17:35] the soul of man is your theophany
[1:17:38] he said but if it's up in heaven
[1:17:41] now
[1:17:43] the day I got born again I was right
[1:17:45] here wouldn't you
[1:17:50] but as far as God is concerned I was up
[1:17:52] here
[1:17:53] right yep
[1:17:56] as far as I was concerned not down here
[1:18:02] fooling me
[1:18:06] what is pulling me
[1:18:08] you get the new birth
[1:18:10] what is pulling you
[1:18:12] the positive of God's mind for you
[1:18:19] so if we have a soul that is eternal
[1:18:25] that soul is our theophany
[1:18:28] right
[1:18:31] right positive in God's mind is what's
[1:18:33] pulling us
[1:18:34] because we need Eternal out here and
[1:18:36] eternal life to Earth
[1:18:39] is pulling us
[1:18:42] he said well brother damn why not the
[1:18:44] Bible says if
[1:18:46] question number one
[1:18:48] were
[1:18:53] meaning something's got to happen to it
[1:18:55] dissolved meaning it's got to be
[1:18:57] destroyed
[1:18:59] if this Earthly Tabernacle
[1:19:02] be our word is off right death you did
[1:19:07] right
[1:19:09] you go right straight into the sixth
[1:19:13] Dimension right
[1:19:16] sold under the altar
[1:19:18] and how do you look
[1:19:20] amen right don't look 71. I'm glad of
[1:19:25] that hobbling around
[1:19:28] when he saw them they were in the prime
[1:19:30] of life
[1:19:31] but he calls it Souls on the altar the
[1:19:34] angel called it sold under the altar why
[1:19:36] would we have any trouble calling it
[1:19:38] Souls why would we have any trouble of
[1:19:40] finding and knowing that the word
[1:19:43] theophany means a body of God of a God
[1:19:46] or a deity and until we were born again
[1:19:48] you and I were serving the devil
[1:19:51] and we were on our way down he was our
[1:19:54] God Amen whether you like it or not
[1:19:58] but then the day he was born again
[1:20:00] you start an upward
[1:20:03] into Eternal theophany that theophany of
[1:20:07] that man
[1:20:09] is going down it's not eternal
[1:20:14] you can't make him an eternal sinner
[1:20:15] come on
[1:20:17] he's going down you and I were going
[1:20:20] down until we got born again are born
[1:20:23] from above in atonement this morning
[1:20:26] all right
[1:20:27] but the difference between a man and an
[1:20:29] animal God put a soul in a man
[1:20:32] he didn't put it in the animal because
[1:20:34] the soul that was in the man is that
[1:20:36] theophany
[1:20:39] all right
[1:20:44] now let's think a minute about let's see
[1:20:46] if we can get this part
[1:20:48] I don't know where to go this way or the
[1:20:51] other way
[1:20:52] we'll go this way look at the next one
[1:20:55] look at Blasphemous names
[1:20:57] 1962 1104 the morning service
[1:21:03] now but here Jehovah Witnesses in their
[1:21:05] book it says that the breath that you
[1:21:07] breathe is the soul
[1:21:08] and that cannot be right the breath that
[1:21:10] you breathe is not soul
[1:21:12] if it is you're one time you're one kind
[1:21:15] of Soul next time you're somebody else
[1:21:17] has breathed that soul look where you'd
[1:21:20] be now the breath is the wind and the
[1:21:22] wind is what you breathe into your
[1:21:24] nostrils
[1:21:25] now they take the scripture from God
[1:21:28] breathes breath into the nostrils and he
[1:21:31] became a living Soul see they take the
[1:21:32] scriptures to try to prove their point
[1:21:34] right
[1:21:35] now I want to ask you something if he
[1:21:37] was a man what kind of a breath was he
[1:21:39] breathing before God breathed and he
[1:21:41] breathed his breath of life into him see
[1:21:44] what kind of a breath
[1:21:47] he was a breathing living man well then
[1:21:49] if that be so then every animal is a
[1:21:52] living Soul cause they breathe a human
[1:21:55] soul see they breathe in and out in and
[1:21:57] out so it all be so
[1:21:58] in our soul and and all together then
[1:22:01] Jesus wouldn't have to had wooden have
[1:22:05] to die have had to die
[1:22:09] me the animal sacrifice would have been
[1:22:12] sufficient
[1:22:13] if you were just breathing in and out if
[1:22:15] that's all it is to it but what God did
[1:22:18] he breathed the breath of eternal life
[1:22:21] now we're coming to Adam for just a
[1:22:23] moment
[1:22:24] because we've got to tell that soul in
[1:22:26] with Adam
[1:22:27] and think about him
[1:22:29] he breathed the breath of eternal life
[1:22:31] amen then he became a living Soul a soul
[1:22:34] that cannot die and watch now we're
[1:22:36] going to get into honey Plum up to
[1:22:38] around the elbows notice breathe the
[1:22:40] breath of eternal life into his nostrils
[1:22:43] he breathed eternal life into Adam
[1:22:48] but not another child after then one of
[1:22:50] course the fall came
[1:22:53] and remember when he breathed the breath
[1:22:55] of eternal life into Adam Eve was still
[1:22:58] in Adam
[1:23:01] right
[1:23:03] okay
[1:23:05] watch what happened to him
[1:23:07] breathe the breath of eternal life into
[1:23:09] his nostrils and he became an eternal
[1:23:11] son or any kind of Soul excuse me
[1:23:14] because God breathes not what nature
[1:23:17] done what God did breathe into the
[1:23:19] breath of life into his nostril and he
[1:23:22] became a living soul
[1:23:23] and you say to me Adam died brother
[1:23:25] Branham
[1:23:26] no no
[1:23:28] but remember before Adam died he had a
[1:23:31] lamb that redeemed him Hallelujah those
[1:23:33] who before knew he has called he got a
[1:23:36] lamb to redeem that he was a top Adam
[1:23:38] fell then the lamb was provided for Adam
[1:23:40] because already in his nostrils had
[1:23:43] become the breadth of the Eternal God
[1:23:46] so there was no way to let him die
[1:23:48] you know what I mean annihilated there
[1:23:51] was no way to annihilate Adam
[1:23:53] he already had eternal life in his soul
[1:23:55] and when brother random gets in the seal
[1:23:57] book and he says you fell from eternal
[1:23:59] life
[1:24:00] well
[1:24:02] and just remember he's just explaining
[1:24:04] here you can't die
[1:24:07] if you have eternal life that Soul can't
[1:24:09] die physically we can die so what
[1:24:11] happened to Adam
[1:24:14] he died naturally
[1:24:18] because the prophet said
[1:24:20] his youth
[1:24:21] was being renewed in the garden
[1:24:24] he wasn't Eternal in body he was only
[1:24:26] Eternal and soul
[1:24:28] so when the prophet said he fell from
[1:24:30] eternal life he fell from eternal life
[1:24:32] eternal life was right there
[1:24:34] the tree of life I've got the notes
[1:24:37] written already
[1:24:38] the Tree of Life
[1:24:40] was in the garden
[1:24:43] and Adam and Eve could have ate that
[1:24:45] tree
[1:24:46] but instead the head of the tree of
[1:24:47] knowledge all right now watch
[1:24:51] an allowance provided for Adam because
[1:24:53] already in Austin he'd become the
[1:24:55] breadth of Eternal of the Eternal God
[1:24:57] and he became a living Soul he was the
[1:24:59] son of God
[1:25:01] now his breath is the African word I
[1:25:03] don't know what the Greek word is for it
[1:25:05] right now but the African word they
[1:25:07] called it a Moya which means the wind
[1:25:11] an unseen Force animal Breeze Memorial
[1:25:13] Sinners breathe the more you
[1:25:17] then why would we struggle for eternal
[1:25:20] life if that's the Eternal Soul breathe
[1:25:24] into us by breath
[1:25:27] why would we seek after eternal life if
[1:25:30] we come into the world with eternal life
[1:25:32] let me put that there amen
[1:25:34] if we're like the people in the message
[1:25:36] teach we come in the world with it
[1:25:38] eternal life why are we seeking eternal
[1:25:40] life
[1:25:42] that only makes sense
[1:25:46] you see
[1:25:49] see he said it backfire why would we
[1:25:51] struggle for eternal life get back for
[1:25:53] his brother it it just can't do it but
[1:25:55] God especially upon Adam where the
[1:25:57] breath of eternal life and he become an
[1:26:00] eternal person with God he had power
[1:26:02] with God he was an amateur God he was
[1:26:05] God of the earth not God Of Heaven now
[1:26:07] God of the Earth
[1:26:09] and someday the sons of God will begin
[1:26:11] become Gods Jesus said so is it is not
[1:26:15] it written in your law your gods and if
[1:26:18] you can call these who he called God God
[1:26:22] visited how can you condemn me saying
[1:26:25] when I say I'm the son of God
[1:26:27] how can you condemn Jesus for doing that
[1:26:29] but into Adam
[1:26:32] he breathed
[1:26:34] the breath of eternal life
[1:26:40] why would we struggle for life
[1:26:44] if we have it
[1:26:47] let's read one more then we'll quit I'll
[1:26:49] pick these up Wednesday
[1:26:51] go ahead with
[1:26:52] number 11. I'll get the rest of them
[1:26:54] Wednesday
[1:26:57] this is Hebrews chapter 4 57 901
[1:27:00] paragraph 229.
[1:27:04] just think of it as our two eternal life
[1:27:10] he's asking the question is there two
[1:27:11] Eternal lives
[1:27:13] you couldn't answer that could you
[1:27:16] there is one eternal life
[1:27:19] so if you have eternal life here and you
[1:27:21] have eternal life that are be careful
[1:27:26] if you come into the world with eternal
[1:27:28] life and you're seeking eternal life be
[1:27:30] careful
[1:27:33] you come in the world lost and re seek
[1:27:36] and eternal life we gotta hope
[1:27:38] right
[1:27:40] then Jesus Christ didn't have to die in
[1:27:42] vain
[1:27:44] if it's something you breathe in breathe
[1:27:46] out
[1:27:47] if that's all a soul is
[1:27:51] then why struggle for eternal life
[1:27:55] think on these things
[1:27:58] you couldn't answer that
[1:28:00] could you
[1:28:01] there's one eternal life and that's the
[1:28:02] life of God
[1:28:05] this other kind of life no matter what
[1:28:06] it is it's got an end to it anything had
[1:28:09] a beginning had an end with anything
[1:28:10] that had no beginning has no end and God
[1:28:13] said he would give us eternal life
[1:28:16] without beginning
[1:28:18] we were just made a part of him
[1:28:22] how much have I been on that right
[1:28:24] and actually the life that in US
[1:28:27] wasn't brought here by human nature
[1:28:31] nature gave us a spirit
[1:28:33] but that Spirit died and we got the
[1:28:35] spirit of God glory to God
[1:28:37] was God a man certainly let us make man
[1:28:40] in our own image what was God a
[1:28:42] theophany a body
[1:28:44] and our man was made like that and put
[1:28:47] over the garden
[1:28:49] but there was no man to tell the soil in
[1:28:52] the senses then he created man Out of
[1:28:54] the Dust of the Earth in the animal and
[1:28:56] that man till the soil
[1:28:59] the man fell by transgression correctly
[1:29:01] and God the theophany come down and was
[1:29:05] made flesh and dwelt among us to redeem
[1:29:08] the man
[1:29:11] all right
[1:29:13] what about it then
[1:29:17] what image
[1:29:20] was the first man that have made
[1:29:23] an image of God
[1:29:25] when was he created
[1:29:27] created
[1:29:29] there was no creation
[1:29:31] it was when God began to bring into view
[1:29:35] his plan
[1:29:37] of redemption
[1:29:40] and before he even started
[1:29:44] the plan on Earth which deals with
[1:29:46] foreknowledge
[1:29:50] he already shows what he's going to do
[1:29:54] just as he already said all names were
[1:29:57] written in the last book of life
[1:30:01] before the foundation of the world
[1:30:04] just as he'd already covered
[1:30:08] the morning Stars sang together
[1:30:10] sons of God shouted for joy
[1:30:14] here's a quote we'll get to
[1:30:18] I got a little note on it
[1:30:20] I already have some quotes laying
[1:30:23] the first thing God created was what
[1:30:27] angels
[1:30:30] the first thing
[1:30:33] human beings Are Not Angels
[1:30:36] he never created us
[1:30:40] as we use the word creation see
[1:30:44] he never created us
[1:30:46] eternal life is not a creation
[1:30:51] it can't begin and it came in
[1:30:54] see where we get tied up in creation and
[1:30:56] beginnings and things and we lose the
[1:30:59] whole concept
[1:31:02] of eternal life
[1:31:05] man was made in the image of God
[1:31:09] before the world ever begun
[1:31:11] then in Genesis 2
[1:31:14] he was put that man was put into that
[1:31:17] human flesh
[1:31:20] and when he did he breed
[1:31:22] into Adam's nostrils because it wasn't
[1:31:25] anybody else there
[1:31:29] is a doctrine that God created more
[1:31:31] people than Adam and Eve I don't agree
[1:31:33] with it
[1:31:36] but there wasn't nobody there but Adam
[1:31:40] so now are you going to deal with Eve
[1:31:43] we've got to bring her into being
[1:31:47] she's a special being
[1:31:49] yes amen
[1:31:51] how are you going to bring her in to be
[1:31:55] well just make her some kind of slop jar
[1:31:57] where she can get us all into sin
[1:32:03] I would hold that quote if I was you
[1:32:05] until we read a few things brother
[1:32:08] Branham says
[1:32:09] about how that Eve came in to be
[1:32:15] and how that she was like
[1:32:19] the church the bride
[1:32:27] all right
[1:32:29] I wouldn't throw off on Eve too much he
[1:32:31] finds everybody we know what happened
[1:32:35] we know what took place
[1:32:39] but he didn't make her a slop jar
[1:32:42] to be able to bring this thing of
[1:32:44] redemption into being
[1:32:48] if he had
[1:32:50] he would have made her from a separate
[1:32:51] piece of soil
[1:32:54] when he made her from the same piece of
[1:32:56] soil of Adam
[1:32:58] and then we'll read where brother random
[1:33:00] said
[1:33:01] Eve was in Adam
[1:33:04] in theophany
[1:33:13] there's no
[1:33:15] written record
[1:33:19] as we would say it in the Bible
[1:33:22] that God breathed into Eve nostrils
[1:33:26] she become living soul
[1:33:31] what had already been said about her
[1:33:33] while she was in Adam
[1:33:35] so you know what's going to happen to
[1:33:36] Eve
[1:33:37] you know how brother Dale believes it
[1:33:40] at least
[1:33:42] that he believes that when Eve come from
[1:33:45] Adam God just took part of that 126 man
[1:33:49] and put it right over into Eve
[1:33:53] in a beautiful creation
[1:34:02] what do you think about it
[1:34:07] God created us in His image
[1:34:13] listening I'm staying closing out with
[1:34:15] it just like it says in Colossians that
[1:34:18] Jesus was in the very image of God
[1:34:22] now what does that mean
[1:34:27] thought it not robbery to be equal to
[1:34:29] God
[1:34:33] he was the image of God what does that
[1:34:35] mean
[1:34:36] well he was just like him over here when
[1:34:37] he was over here just like him with you
[1:34:39] no it was the same God
[1:34:44] or your trinitarian
[1:34:48] and it were the children of God
[1:34:52] then we're the same God made manifest
[1:34:54] are you a trinitarian steel and you're
[1:34:57] hooked up on a doctrine that the
[1:34:59] denominations got called eternal sonship
[1:35:05] we don't believe that
[1:35:08] but we believe in eternal godship
[1:35:11] but now brother Dale you're just making
[1:35:13] us too much
[1:35:19] the prophet of God said when the bride
[1:35:21] realizes who she is
[1:35:24] and what she's here for
[1:35:27] come on brothers
[1:35:30] so she'll be gone
[1:35:33] well while we've been around here so
