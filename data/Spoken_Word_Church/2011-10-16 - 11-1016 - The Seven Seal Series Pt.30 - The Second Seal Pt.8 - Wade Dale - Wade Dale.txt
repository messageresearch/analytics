TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you know okay Susan is let me let me um interpret that she was 57 yesterday oh yeah right actually I was 35. 57 good 3. hi Mom hi Mom hi Mom at least somebody's finally older than me that's correct well good to have everybody here for the game thanks again for all the ones that uh could help help while we've been gone we had a good time with brother Richards and um always feel good to be back home again let's turn the Book of Revelations unless we're going to finish the second seal today the question was raised at the end of the last time was was what does the second Seal have to do with our Redemption all right so we're going to cover that today all right we're going to read revelation 6. we're going to cover one and two today so we're going to put block one and two first first he'll take a seal and then next Sunday Lord willing next Sunday we'll be here yeah okay next weekend we will start on the third field so read start reading in your book the third film all right and everybody clear now what was happening in the natural part of the second seal it's pretty much written down here and you can pretty much go over it that it was during the Dark Ages that physically Christians were being killed but spiritually Untold Millions were being killed by the brown said billions because what had happened to this Antichrist Spirit it had now become a person a false prophet and had become I don't like to say incarnate because Satan is not going to be incarnate in a man until we leave because he doesn't know how to totally be incarnate in a person until he watches God being totally incarnate in his end time right all right because remember Satan's a copycat so this Antichrist with the spirit a little saying didn't it become a deed Doctrine and then all that but the false prophet was part of the second seal and it was during the Dark Ages it was the ox combat Beast Powell was given what a Doctrine they started preaching a Doctrine and the main Doctrine was kind of strange how that Doctrine gets back again like we were talking about the River Jordan Doctrine and and uh if you'll if some of you don't have that then I pulled off the internet from that man named corinthius most of you do any shaking your head if you don't then ask me and brother Joe will run it off the internet but if you look up man cyrinthia he's teaching the same thing that people are messing to teach them now what has happened that has come back in the end time because it's got to Incarnate a pope right got incarnate a pope in the end time so all these doctrines that started back in after Jesus was gone and after the apostles were killed off that same Spirit though those people are surrendous and those people are dead that same Spirit or that same Doctrine or that's that same devil is any end time see they had to deal in the in the first days they had to deal with the Antichrist Spirit a saying among the people when you got into this second age they actually physically put a man up there and put a crown on his head and said he is the biker of God he's the one that's going to take over he is going to be to us instead of God until then man started looking at a pope all right then you come over here and you look they got you got you got uh sayings Deeds Doctrine Doctrine then you're going to have incarnate false prophet a little bit later on because what Satan is going to do is he's going to totally take over a person now he's among the people just like God is but God's Gonna God's going to Incarnate a group of people if you're born again today you are God incarnate that's right but not to its fullness like I was preaching the other Sunday by partial to perfect you have a partial understanding you have a down payment you have the earnest of your inheritance which is what get this guy changed all right but let's go back to the second seal we see that it was a red horse so now the first horse was what white right a white righteous Church wrote out under the under the false pretense that they were correct which they weren't but there was a white righteous Church come out right right A.D 33 when the Holy Ghost fell that was a righteous group of people still have problems Peter and Paul still have problems in in doctrinal issues but they never want to kill each other like some people in a message do now they'd rather zap you out of him but that was then what was that doing that was bringing a group of people in the body because God rides first then this comes to combat it Satan's Satan's the one that comes after so God sent out a white righteous church God sent out a Blood Washed group of people God sent out of people that have been washed by the blood right but now watch this in the end time see they had to fight this in the first three ages they had to fight that in the first four ages look what we got to fight down here we got to fight the old guy we gotta fight the old guy that's got all that he's a little more he's kind of like the guy that's that's trained in the box or training to fight or or whatever you know or a rookie what we call a rookie I call him a rookie right here but now down here he's a pro he knows what he's doing the Bible said it would deceive the very elect if possible and it's not possible but brother Brown said it's going to be so close see so we got to be on our toes we got to be watching because it's not just the spirit it's not just a false prophet it's not just you know a system it's now in the highest form is the wrong in this message the message is not wrong right right message is perfect the message has been perfect since the first age I don't have the first stage up there the since the first days the message has been perfect God can't bring anything in her so so the message is perfect all right but what Satan does he he gets and puts a little this in this one's mine a little this and this one's mine and you know God Winks at the ignorance even even during this time here of Luther and Wesley were they still baptized under this same false teaching father son Holy Ghost never has been a right teaching okay everybody understand that God winked at their ignorance but it never was a right teaching the Trinity never was right right but Luther taught it and God filled him with the Holy Ghost because of Luther's ignorance of the word of God right right yeah Wesley's ignorance of the word of God even the Pentecostals with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gift coming back into the church God still winked at that because why because why did God wink at that brother Brandon said if you'll read marriage and divorce he said because a misinterpreted theology we've got in this mess well marriage in divorce we know that was a natural happening and we've all been you know part of it uh we all were born married to somebody else whether we've ever physically married somebody else or not okay so we were married to the devil because of what happened a long time ago but still you and I have come to a place to where that's got to be struck out of us and the first and the and the most the the the best thing to strike it out of you is the boy the best thing to strike all that out of you is the blood Jesus sent the blood Jesus or Jesus came in flesh to shed his blood for Martin Luther even though he knew Martin Luther now Jesus the flesh man probably didn't sit there and say well Martin Luther but God had already spoken Jesus was the word of God all right all right when he went up and came back he had full uh understanding because he was God yet he was still man but he was what he was uh glorified I guess you want to say I want to say something out there he's glorified he's in the glorified condition so he knew all things and he knew Martin Luther was going to come he knew that Martin Luther was going to preach a a false Doctrine but yet there was truth to Luther God said okay I'm gonna wink at that because of it misinterpreted theology got these two started right misinterpreted theology got these two started don't think I talked to somebody one time before and just for a minute and he was kind of going I went through the co series down in Florida with them with brother Keith Brown and he happened to be there and he pulled me aside afterwards and he said you know he said and he's been the message wow and he said I never looked at he said I always looked at the seals as being all bad everything bad because it is you why horseriders you're destruction it you're a Jews being killed in the fifth if you took the literal and just read this down through here that's a it's a horrible happening there's not a lot good about it doesn't say like in the church ages it didn't kind of give you a little loudness as those who believe in other words I'll give them you know I'll write their name in the book and all that stuff but in this right here it says and when he had opened the second seal I heard the start second BC come and see and they went out another horse that was red and power's gun on him to what take peace from the earth kill one another and then we'll get on and him sword there was no way out bad he said I've always looked at the seals opening as being a bad happening well see I was teaching the seals as being justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost the opening of the word fifth seal Grace justification higher form six seal sanctification higher form where God burns your Earth off and then the seventh seal which is the Capstone which takes us out of him he said I've never seen it that way before so maybe that would help but see our mentality has been that man these are just horrible happening sure there is part this all part here sounds bad but remember the good part was there first that's right The Good the word of God was there first the people of God were there first the dolphins that were right were there first because you can't have like brother Brown said it's a very small statement but profound fish wouldn't need a gill if it didn't have water or a fan he said but God had to water there so the fish needed a fan what the water was already there so the word of God is already there these seals are for the Redemption of this guy right here not not these people in the Dark Ages not these people in age one two and three not five not six not even seven we come out of remember the seventh Church age this is still seven Church eight but we're going to be called out we're going to be in the eighth Eighth Day all right called up called out and after these things see in Revelations 4 1 you say well that's the rapture um you got to start here right you got to start here remember remember the Bible says after these things John looks up sees an Open Door see the open doors in the end time all this right here is what closed the door and the church agent this Antichrist spirit this man that comes up called the pope this incarnate false prophet all these things doctrines Deeds all that stuff that comes from the Devil but it is in opposition to what God's already doing to a group of people so these seals are not uh yes it's going to be a bad happening if you're in if you're in that group but if you come out of that it's a glorious thing the first seals you see what was a white righteous Church the devil was just he was in there deceiving yeah the white righteous church that turned the word down but the white righteous church that was born on the day of Pentecost by the blood of Jesus Christ that was a glorious group of people that truly was a white righteous group of people they had all these gifts working in their life do we are we are we so far back till we're not even the first church age but we're so far back that we're not even just like the 3 000 downstairs the Babbling babies at Pentecost they said men and brother what must we do to be saved or do we have these gifts working in our life that's the question you need to ask yourself because I can't answer that right okay but that's what happened God did send a white righteous church out and what did that do that justified a group of people you said well that's just not listen the Bible says those who is Justified he's already glorified because true listen true justification Nation will take you to the baptism of the Holy Ghost I said true justification now I believe this is just my this is my belief I believe that you can be justified in a in a a Baptist Church because you can say God it says in the Bible if you believe on Jesus Christ I know you can't believe on him like we believe on him because you got to have a holy ghost but the Bible says if you'll confess your sins God will save you remember brother Brown said they didn't have enough to go on to the next step they just get you and and what is justification it's just chopping off your past sins man Tempo was talking about yesterday or day before that's just chopping off your past sin that has nothing to do the smoking the drinking the the Corrals and that's still there right that's right but God has wiped your slate clean this is wide as this board right here from their back from there back and you say well that's true that's justification but if they don't go on any further brother Brown said you sin the next day you gotta you gotta ask forgiven that you got of course we have to keep asking forgiveness but those sins start heaping up why did the Bible say the unclean Spirit goes out at sanctification walketh and dry places findeth none coming back finds the place what swept and garnish now that's sanctification that's what we're talking about today because justification I'm not belittling the first three ages they were a powerful age but to me that was that white righteous church that made me and you white and righteous because I believe if that person dies and and truly repents and he dies a week later and he's in his walk and I see you got to look at the Providence of God Providence of God is that that man would never go any further but he truly did repent that's right now he's not Bride come on I want everybody to realize he is not bride only Holy Ghost filled people are bride so he's not bribe but if he dies he comes off that white Throne judgment he'd be given eternal life right because he had all that past forgiven but see that in the Bible then you say well those who he truly Justified he's also glorified that's not about true justification that because if you're if God see God's only one knows that we don't we don't know that we're going to go on God does right but he gives it to you and has it there for you why do you think we've come from all different places and I'm gonna come with this church and I'm talking about all different walks of life that's right and we walk up and go man I never heard that before Justified see that's as if you've never done it you know you did it I know I did what I did but God can't see that but see I went on to the baptism of Holy Ghost so now I can truly say I was truly Justified going on to the baptism of the Holy Ghost this is important he said well this ain't going to do with the seal yeah it does the first four seal that we're going to talk about here the first four seals gets us out of him right everybody understand that because Rapture happens in for sale right justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then us becoming the word and leaving here but now let me throw one more thing in you got to take five six and seven and put them right back in here everybody see what I'm doing that's right you gotta take five six and seven put them right back in here to change the body that's right sure it takes off seven all right if we were just gonna die and go by the grave we could do it before right right now does everybody understand that kind of that may be a little deep for something a little complicated okay but the first four seals gets you in the body of Christ if you're looking on the way we're gonna look at it okay not not that all this bad's gonna happen we got to go through the bad to show you the good that's right gotta go through the bad and show you the good brother Brown said to have a virtuous woman there had to be a prostitute to show that a virtuous woman could make it same way with the thief and Alive they had to be all that to show God all right so the same thing in your justification if you're truly Justified this morning your sins are gone now it's up to you to continue on continue on but if you make it to justification you can die and could be given eternal life I don't like that word could could be given because if you get to this stage of having the baptism of the Holy Ghost you have eternal life you don't have to go get it that's right you don't have to worry about it ever ever that's why those who he has Justified he is already glorified if you're Justified Sanctified field the Holy Ghost this morning you're glorified what else are you going to need you say well what if I die you'll just get glorified before I do if I take the change without nothing you're just going to get glorified before I do because the dead and Christ shall rise first and then we which are alive and remain so she is not ashamed to pass on it's really not but you're just going to come up first but you yeah but you're going to come up because of somebody standing here that's alive that's right right somebody's got to be alive the resurrection message was not preached by a bunch of dead people no he has risen was by a bunch of alive people that said he's written Bill Martin what happens to that person that's Justified that doesn't receive only 59. yeah now see that's where I believe there's Dimensions inside of Dimension you say well how do you know that I'm using a quote by Brother Brown brother Brown wanted to know if Paul made it now he was in the sixth dimension right Paul was a born-again Believer and he was also in a sixth Dimension but brother Brown couldn't see him because if not he would have walked up and said hey I saw Paul Irene is my no I believe each age is put in a section there's sections inside and yes I don't they will not go to sixth Dimension because the only people kind of loud today I'm preaching kind of loud today sorry but those only that are born again are going to be in the sixth Dimension that's proven a fact right brother random went to the sixth Dimension that was Holy Ghost Philippines only Fifth Dimension I believe bro Martin made the place that they go in The Fifth Dimension I don't I don't know whether God sets them aside or or the maintenance out of Dimension but I don't think they're tormented like the ones in the Fifth Dimension that just went you know centers went to the dimension would there still be a paradise side of hell like there was before you could you could say that you could say that before you understand what you're saying you know though with the paradise because the blood didn't come with blood Jesus had not come to cover them yet so the blood of bulls and goats covered them they were putting them I just believe there's not just seven dimensions like Daddy was preaching you know you got eight Dimensions you got you you know you got you got different things but his Dimensions inside a dimension because remember what do we live in we live in three dimensions life life matter right so we conduct our business in three dimensions the fourth dimension is television radio cell phones anything with weight you know brother Graham called him either ways I don't think they use ether tubes anymore but we can say it's a chip Dimension now so a microchip dimensions but if you're born again we don't have to worry about that but but we can't assume that everybody's born again but we can't assume that we can all say God forgive me of my sins forgive me of my past and then walk on you decide whether you make it the sanctification and then it's sanctification just like we're at now that's where that bloody red horse rode through these dark ages but that's that sanctification I'm trying to work this right that sanctification was their Holy Ghost just like Luther's justification Was His Holy Ghost never understand that God winked at Luther's ignorance because what man had taught see the miss the grace of God these seals are the grace of God every seal is Grace you say on the fifth silver brother said the fifth seal was showing the grace of God right to a group of people that didn't want him well guess what you and I were a group of people in the morning right we're going to get into that in the Fairfield we didn't want to be saved I didn't right I didn't want to be saved oh yeah you did you come why did I come something inside of me grooming called me all right that's right like I said before I told the mountain in Kansas you know you've got to hear the word of God before you are convicted you can't just you say well my Grandmama talked what'd she tell you about rocks and trees no she told you about the word of God you need to go to church you need to get saved you need not to do this you need to not do that what was she doing she wasn't reading you a scripture that's right she was the word telling you if you didn't have to read it we're written epistle I mean really if you got to quote people scripture if you got to quote quotes all the time I know we're supposed to but aren't we supposed to be the Living Word of God to where we say hey this happened in my life right I mean we can read where Paul and we were going to read today but we won't Man Gordon wants to go this way where Paul says I Die daily well that's a higher form of sanctification surprise all right clear you clear your computers hit delete no don't hit delete hit save saved hit save You're Gonna Save that over because we're going to talk about now let's go back to this the first seal with the white righteous church if you're truly Justified you're just as righteous brother Brown said that you've never done that in God's eyes in the devil's eyes he still riding through all this he's still on these horses people just because you're not the Holy Ghost don't mean you killed that horse no right because what's happened now his Doctrine is being put in force that's right it's Doctrine Satan's Doctrine he's got a Doctrine it's being put in for us but remember God's doctrines first then he said there's no weapon formed let them stand against you because God gave Satan he didn't give him the sword or he'd had to give him the word he gave him an opportunity to pervert it okay and that's what he done Satan did but as he did that God also give us a sword and what does the sword usually do hurts Cuts draws blood right never seen many nice knife fights if you if you don't see any nice night fights where they go I'm gonna cut you no they go for whatever they can go for go throw whatever right yeah so that's what the word of God's doing in justification you're just kind of uh in my experience I was just kind of I was I felt empty I felt you know I felt like all the burdens of my sin had been gone but they don't desire to do first one thing in another name it you you're related to your life it was still there except for one thing and I don't know why God took that away from me instantly and that was using tobacco chewing tobacco snuff and all that because the very day that I came to church and give my heart to God the next day I didn't want him anymore it just went away uh and that don't happen you people that smoke you people that's just you know used stuff it just don't go away they just don't but mine did I mean I had cans of that stuff laying everywhere and Jim companion I had it all over the house kept one in my pocket one in my briefcase going to work got some at work it was just like it had never happened before and that's not normal but see God did that for me because he knew it probably would be hard and would hinder me if if I kept on but even in my Justified condition I believe God took that away from me we said well that's sanctification look people yeah people rather than sisters this is not just and that's just in case that came back to him and Holy Ghost it's not justification you're done with that yeah sanctification you're done with that it's just like those those uh virtues that line is there just in a picture if you were to draw that you'd have to put Faith all over that pyramid you'd have to put virtue all over that pyramid you'd have to put knowledge Temperance patients all over the pyramid not just you get one and then no now listen there is a finality to that there is a time when God says okay you've done that right you've got virtue but he don't quit adding virtue right no no but you've reached a position okay same thing with justification you reach a place to where you know that God's forgive you your sins and you know how you know that you trust in what he said right he said I am just to forgive you and he said that just to fire him and the Justified I'm quoting scripture are one the justifier and the Justified are one that's right don't be truly Justified you're already glorified because God knows you're going to go on to receive the baptismal but you've got to do it in stages yes now if Christians have sins then you can't do away with justification you have to steal that God forgive me of what I did forgive me of this forgive me of that you know I want to give you a little testimony um brother Tim he'd come we're riding you know work we talked a little bit and he looked at me one day and he said I'm saved thank you and I believe I'm safe I said well that's what you got to do you got to First believe that you're safe don't don't worry about the devil and what you know you say oh well uh smoking and drinking and looking at naked women and you know all that stuff so yeah you're human that's right it still bothers me I mean they're smoking and drinking part but pretty woman I'm sorry I just always bothers you you quit looking at one you look over here and you see them that's less much worse than the one you turned from so you just you can't always look up or you have a wreck so you just have to believe though that you say Lord forgive me any thought that comes through my mind God forgive me now see the difference is if you sit there and dwell on that thought like you used to right same way with you women that's right you want to dress the man or the man undressed woman with your eyes you got a problem you're committing adultery is what God Said right but you can't help from that thought to come across but you can help kicking it out not let it build a case that's right see that's the difference in a Justified condition you say God my sins are forgiven the devil says I'll drive by places and he'll say you did this here and you did this here and you did this thing yeah and I just say no not this guy did it that's right the one that's riding today didn't do that we were trapped into it the prophet said but we got to start so in justification in that first church age that was a white righteous Church they had the Holy Ghost they had the gift working but it's a form of justification because we've got to go to the higher form of justification to where we know there's got to come a place to where you know that you're not even going to worry about that past God's already put in to see it forgetfulness like brother Keith reset and put a no fishing sign up so nobody needs to go fishing right yeah if God pushing them to see it forgetfulness don't go fishing it out okay which is a good point but now sanctification is what we were going to talk on today we got about two minutes so sanctification is what the blood the blood sanctifies you that's the only thing it does now that cleans you and sets you a sign for service in other words the smoking ought to go out see everybody said well what's your experience well boy when I got born again everything went out that may be true let me not be so dogmatic because I believe you can be justified Sanctified filled with a holy ghost in One sermon in one sermon because the 3 000 downstairs and at the day of Pentecost they heard one sermon and they went through justification sanctification and received a holy ghost in One sermon but now for some that's bullheaded and hardheaded like me it took a while so let's just say we're all bullheaded and it takes us a while all right so we're Justified all right white righteous if you're truly Justified God looks at you as righteous because he can't hold anything against you or your Center in his eyes does everybody understand that in his eyes so he's clean your slave but then you start sinning again because the unclean Spirit has not left yet all right throw my spirits now but now in sanctification though you start walking through life and it may take you a year two years you know what it may take you 20 years you may fall back Joe what you're here you're alive you can do something about it now if you died and went on you've done you've done your judgment but you're still alive you're still here and you're still able to say God forgive me of that all right cut out the drinking one day you're going to realize hey that thing's gone and I don't even want it anymore or the or the are the commitment adultery or whatever just name I mean you know let's just sin is unbelief it's just not believing that you're Sanctified right right you just don't believe you're Sanctified that's the whole thing it ain't that I quit doing this and quit doing that it's just you didn't believe you say I'm believing but you know what you're doing and sanctification to me in justification you're just like a fish out of water you really don't know how to handle things but when you come to sanctification and this is not do's and don'ts we got one minute this is not do's and don'ts all right but you do start going to church can't get it anywhere else right you do start having different friends because your separation of what they've been doing and what you're doing you see that now as condemnation and you draw away from it start getting around believers because you got what you got to find somebody with some virtue before you can draw it from you gotta so you gotta start doing the things to me sanctification is the do's and don'ts not the holy ghost that would say well I got the Holy Ghost because I quit drinking no no that should have went out at sanctification brother random teaches that he never teaches that the Holy Ghost is getting rid of the smoking the drinking and adultery and all that stuff he said that's a sanctification because even the Bible says we may do it next Sunday but we got to go the unclean Spirit goes out at sanctification walks and driving places find seek a fresh mind of none but he's going to come back right that's right he's going to come back and he's going to do this right here he's going to give you an antichrist Spirit if you don't watch what you're doing yeah and tell you one dude first for for uh I don't hardly ever give you a lesson Look up the word justification and sanctification it's the dictionary and bring them with me I want to see them dictionary thesaurus whatever you want to do justification and sanctification or Sanctified or Justified either one doesn't matter
