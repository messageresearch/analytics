[25:28] your grace and to us thank you for all
[25:30] things
[25:32] and we know you said you give them to us
[25:33] freely so we stand here believing that
[25:35] this afternoon that you'll come on the
[25:37] scene and given to us the things we have
[25:40] need of
[25:41] because we pray as the scripture says
[25:44] that give us this day our daily bread so
[25:47] we grow day by day by faith in thy word
[25:50] and lord we know that we're to be as the
[25:53] prophet said this morning that the
[25:55] people couldn't wait
[25:57] so help us to wait upon you to make
[26:00] manifest your word and to walk in the
[26:02] light of the hour that we're living
[26:04] forgive our sins and lead us
[26:06] lord by thy grace and love and just have
[26:09] your way down and teach us in jesus name
[26:12] amen
[26:14] ephesians 1.
[26:20] we'll go like i've been to verse 3
[26:21] through probably verse 7 i think it is
[26:23] six or seven
[26:25] blessed be the god and father of our
[26:26] lord jesus christ who has blessed
[26:29] us with all spiritual blessings in
[26:31] heavenly places in christ
[26:34] according as he had chosen us in him
[26:36] before the foundation of the world
[26:38] that we should be holding without blame
[26:40] before him in love
[26:41] having predestinated us unto the
[26:43] adoption of children by jesus christ
[26:46] to himself according to the good
[26:48] pleasure of his will
[26:50] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[26:52] wherein he hath made us accepted
[26:55] in the beloved okay
[26:58] let's go to galatians
[27:02] you know i said romans but it's a
[27:03] galatians forgive me i'm thinking on
[27:06] romans 8 so
[27:08] but i want to use this one and then
[27:09] we'll get it in the way go to galatians
[27:12] 4.
[27:17] now i say that the air as long as he is
[27:19] a child differs nothing from a servant
[27:21] though he'd be lord of all
[27:24] but he's under tutors and governors
[27:26] until the time appointed of the father
[27:28] even so we when we were children were in
[27:31] bondage under the elements of the world
[27:33] but when the fullness of the time was
[27:35] come god sent forth his son made of a
[27:37] woman made under the law
[27:40] to redeem them that were under the law
[27:42] that we might receive the adoption of
[27:44] sons
[27:45] and because he our sons god has sent
[27:48] forth the spirit of his son into your
[27:50] hearts
[27:51] crying
[27:52] out by father wherefore dart no more a
[27:55] servant but a son and a son than an hour
[27:57] of god true christ you may be seated the
[28:00] lord
[28:01] blessing to the reading of the word
[28:05] now
[28:06] we were trying to
[28:09] express this morning and
[28:11] it was so i got real fast so
[28:14] i was trying to bring out a lot of
[28:15] things but you understand and i was
[28:18] doing it you know just to make sure we
[28:19] didn't i didn't want you to
[28:21] misunderstand what i was talking about
[28:24] how that jesus never
[28:26] never
[28:27] you know
[28:28] give us an inheritance
[28:31] he was the one that stood between god
[28:33] and man
[28:35] to transmit that inheritance
[28:38] down
[28:40] to us and him being almighty god the
[28:43] inheritance was fully in him
[28:46] but how could it be brought out
[28:48] see
[28:50] and while he was here in that flesh
[28:53] he could not transmit that life
[28:56] you know the eternal life our
[28:58] inheritance which was our name written
[28:59] on the lamb's book of life before the
[29:01] foundation of the world and there was no
[29:03] way that he could could do that while he
[29:06] was alive so it meant he had to die
[29:09] see to be able to
[29:11] bring us to our bring the inheritance to
[29:14] the position
[29:15] that you and i could receive it and as i
[29:18] said
[29:19] god could not then just say well i'll
[29:21] just sprinkle eternal life down through
[29:24] time and so many people will grab it and
[29:27] you know and they'll become eternal and
[29:29] that would be what you would be saying
[29:31] if you were believing the doctrine that
[29:33] you always was eternal you don't need
[29:36] the new birth and things like that you
[29:38] just always was eternal well i i don't
[29:42] agree with that
[29:43] i agree with what the prophet is saying
[29:46] that you always was eternal because he's
[29:48] talking about if you have eternal life
[29:51] if you received eternal life that
[29:52] eternal life always was eternal but
[29:55] there was a time i didn't possess it as
[29:58] a person and even i hope you were
[30:00] catching it on the point that i was
[30:02] making that see then brother branham
[30:05] said that in doing what he done
[30:08] jesus inherited eternal life
[30:11] not that he had to have eternal life and
[30:13] soul because he was almighty god but the
[30:16] body
[30:17] was a human element that had to
[30:20] be made eternal see it was it was an
[30:23] element had a beginning so in doing the
[30:25] way he done he inherited eternal life in
[30:28] body
[30:30] and by that then you could go to the
[30:32] future home and say you know by this
[30:35] part of the earth which was on the river
[30:36] jordan he said you know this is my
[30:38] beloved son in whom i'm pleased to dwell
[30:40] and
[30:41] the prophet interpreting what that was
[30:43] saying was this is the part of the earth
[30:45] that i have redeemed and from this part
[30:48] of the earth i'll redeem the rest of it
[30:50] so that our bodies are in the process of
[30:52] being redeemed right
[30:54] and and it's working from the inside out
[30:57] and we stand like he did
[30:59] in a human mortal body
[31:02] that needed redemption not because he
[31:04] was a sinner but because his body had a
[31:07] beginning
[31:08] and he inherited that by doing the way
[31:11] he did so he gets something so we get
[31:13] something and we're heirs with him
[31:15] whatever he gets we're joined afterwards
[31:18] and i hope he was listening to to the
[31:20] point of trying to bring it to you at
[31:22] least thinking spiritual to that place
[31:25] of what
[31:26] we're talking about
[31:27] but now we're going to go into it if you
[31:30] will that's reason i say in romans uh
[31:32] you know we're going to go into romans 8
[31:35] all right so if you will read romans 8
[31:38] and study it especially from about verse
[31:41] 14 i think it is
[31:43] of romans 8 on what through 22-23 and
[31:47] just study that over
[31:48] and think about it and we'll be covering
[31:51] adoption
[31:53] and it will be in uh three stages
[31:57] you know and it covers it there in three
[32:00] stages but i want to get onto that just
[32:01] in one message
[32:03] but what i want you to do is to think on
[32:06] those things and you know
[32:08] think of adoption
[32:11] now
[32:13] in our natural day of d adoption is like
[32:17] you adopt somebody else's children
[32:19] all right uh you know
[32:21] that is our form of adoption but in
[32:24] biblical terms
[32:25] the uh one that's like we read in in uh
[32:28] galatians that
[32:30] see when a baby's born into the family
[32:34] that that
[32:35] became a point that where that baby was
[32:38] a baby it was a child it was an heir
[32:41] but it was not to the point of being
[32:44] able to
[32:45] uh handle
[32:47] or do or or talk about even you know the
[32:51] the inheritance that it was entitled to
[32:54] and was not
[32:56] it wasn't
[32:58] to the point of what would be called
[32:59] sonship
[33:01] and sonship deals with
[33:03] the basis of you're growing up you know
[33:07] all right and see we'll be covering that
[33:11] and you think on those things
[33:13] and uh you know we'll get to a point at
[33:15] the end of the message to make sure you
[33:17] understand
[33:18] how that we're tying it together but
[33:20] there's a little talk that i want to
[33:21] bring this afternoon
[33:23] and uh
[33:25] i don't know i meant to be short this
[33:26] morning and longer this evening but you
[33:29] know we'll get through by five o'clock
[33:31] anyway
[33:32] but but
[33:33] just uh
[33:34] bear with me
[33:36] because i want to make a point
[33:39] now
[33:40] as i said in the natural days
[33:42] of adoption
[33:44] we adopt
[33:46] other people's children
[33:48] you know into our families and then make
[33:50] them inheritance with us and as far as
[33:52] the law is concerned if you adopt a
[33:54] child
[33:55] and it's true adoption then that child
[33:58] is as much air as any
[34:00] child born into your natural family
[34:03] because that's the the law of adoption
[34:06] all right and uh see then doing that
[34:09] uh i know brother picash they have a lot
[34:11] of children there in the orphanage but
[34:13] at certain ones that they adopt
[34:15] when it does that means that that comes
[34:17] into their their lineage part with them
[34:20] seeing and
[34:21] you know making them i've talked with
[34:23] him before on it but
[34:25] um
[34:28] see we think about adoption and a lot
[34:31] has been said about it that you know
[34:34] of what it is and
[34:36] uh i'm just going to give you the
[34:39] definition from strong's concordance
[34:41] it says adoption of children 5206 and
[34:44] it's the same one for all six times
[34:46] adoption is used in the bible
[34:48] and
[34:50] said adoptionist sons
[34:52] says that relationship which god was
[34:55] pleased to establish between himself and
[34:57] the israelites
[34:59] in preference to all of the nations
[35:03] it means the nature and condition of the
[35:05] true disciples in christ
[35:07] who by receiving the spirit of god into
[35:10] their souls become sons of god
[35:13] it also includes the blessed state
[35:15] look for in the future life after the
[35:18] visible return of christ from heaven in
[35:22] other words goes all the way through all
[35:23] right now
[35:25] the point i want to make with you now i
[35:26] know brother branham i'll make the
[35:28] statement now then i'll re-read it your
[35:30] adoption is not your birth
[35:34] all right
[35:35] now and i'll re-read that to you in a
[35:37] minute to where you'll keep that but the
[35:39] point i want you to get in mind is one
[35:41] thing
[35:44] you and i the adoption uh i forgot to
[35:47] write that down
[35:48] but
[35:49] adoption was it really pertained to
[35:51] israel
[35:53] all right because it was an israelite
[35:55] custom
[35:56] and you know coming down but it paul
[36:00] says adoption pertained to israel and
[36:02] the covenants the receiving of the
[36:04] commandments etc etc belonged to israel
[36:08] because they were god's chosen people
[36:11] all right you and i were gentiles
[36:14] no lineage right whatsoever to be
[36:17] connected to
[36:19] god and adoption
[36:21] all right now
[36:23] but the only way that i can really get
[36:25] in to the right understanding
[36:28] for me to see it now is this way
[36:31] being that we were alienated from in
[36:34] this that's in the scripture ephesians i
[36:36] think alienated from the commonwealth of
[36:38] god right all right see we had no rights
[36:41] no lineages right there's not anything
[36:44] we can go to
[36:46] we can't go look how good i was look who
[36:48] i was born from my mom and my daddy were
[36:51] jews and i'm a jew you know paul said
[36:54] it's not not a jesus that would have it
[36:56] to do this inwardly and what's he
[36:57] talking about the new birth
[37:00] all right now
[37:02] we came kin folks to the devil
[37:05] of course the israelites did too and
[37:07] everything but they were setting up a
[37:09] stage
[37:10] right for god to be later used and and
[37:12] i've done a little uh research one time
[37:15] on
[37:16] the adoption of ways and and i don't
[37:18] mean it's not in the bible i mean
[37:20] they but they picked up a custom from
[37:23] other nations
[37:24] and israel began doing that right
[37:28] and and god didn't say amen i'll just
[37:30] put that in the word and i was already
[37:32] in the word but he
[37:34] it came on fourth because you won't find
[37:36] a lot in the old testament except uh
[37:38] you'll find um joseph and the code of
[37:41] many colors
[37:42] and and but the word adoption is not
[37:45] used right but that was what was taking
[37:47] place
[37:48] the one who was tutored and trained and
[37:51] each child as we'll cover later i
[37:53] believe each child and the children of
[37:55] israel
[37:56] i don't believe it's just joseph that
[37:58] receive the uh adoption i believe all of
[38:02] the others when they reached a certain
[38:04] age and were proven to be children of
[38:07] the family then they received their
[38:09] adoption
[38:11] you know
[38:12] into the family and all like that but
[38:15] joseph got a special blessing and got
[38:18] because he was the chosen of god i mean
[38:21] joseph his father
[38:22] and born late age you know like that
[38:25] and he received the coat of many colors
[38:28] we will review these things later but
[38:31] i'm trying to make a point to you see so
[38:34] the first thing is we've got to get into
[38:36] the family of god
[38:38] that's the point of adoption adoption
[38:40] will be to the point that god only
[38:43] adopts his own children
[38:45] he doesn't adopt the devil's children so
[38:48] we were born kin folks to the devil
[38:50] right
[38:51] according to the book of ruth we had one
[38:53] year again
[38:55] and we had the things had to be done to
[38:58] bring us to the place that was there and
[39:01] you know and in doing that then
[39:04] if we receive the new birth it brings us
[39:06] into the family
[39:08] all right now i want to use it like this
[39:11] and if you differ with me or somebody
[39:13] hears me say it i'm making this
[39:15] statement of my own for clarification
[39:18] all right
[39:19] that
[39:21] if we go to romans and find that you
[39:23] receive the spirit of adoption
[39:25] and we will cover that all right then
[39:27] the spirit of adoption can be your new
[39:30] birth right amen
[39:32] right
[39:32] the spirit of adoption you didn't have
[39:34] the spirit of adoption
[39:36] amen until you received the new birth
[39:39] that is your spirit of adoption all
[39:41] right everybody understand me
[39:43] so then we had to be brought into the
[39:45] family of god so why can't we say that
[39:48] by the new birth we receive the spirit
[39:51] of adoption
[39:54] so if god adopts us amen into the
[39:58] israelite
[40:00] promise not the israelite conditions
[40:02] nations etc no but he makes us a jew at
[40:06] heart
[40:07] an israelite
[40:09] life which is children of god he makes
[40:11] us that in heart
[40:13] not in natural lineage
[40:16] all right so now does everybody
[40:17] understand what i'm saying
[40:19] your new birth to me
[40:21] being the spirit of adoption
[40:23] brings you into the family
[40:26] and that way you're adopted into
[40:29] the family of god
[40:31] because you had no right of being in the
[40:32] family we have no lineage no no
[40:34] connections there's no we can't say that
[40:37] we're abraham's our father
[40:40] no abraham the father of israelites not
[40:43] father of gentiles
[40:46] now i know that a lot of them came out
[40:47] of that
[40:48] sure all right
[40:50] i understand that you know of ishmael
[40:53] and the isaacs and all of that i
[40:55] understand the story
[40:57] but still they had no promise
[41:00] the dismal side never had no promise
[41:03] it was only to the israelites which the
[41:05] promise made which would be the children
[41:07] of ishmael i mean
[41:09] of isaac right and israel had no
[41:11] connection
[41:12] whatsoever to it but now
[41:15] the thing on what i'm saying is you must
[41:17] receive the new birth right
[41:20] all right i don't want you to come up
[41:22] later and say but yet now this don't
[41:24] sound exactly the way you were bringing
[41:26] it
[41:27] sunday see i want this in your mind
[41:30] that we must be brought into the family
[41:32] of god all right
[41:35] so we could use the word adoption in the
[41:38] terms of bringing us into the family
[41:44] because if you don't do it that way
[41:46] then you would be making the sons of god
[41:48] in
[41:49] not even no lineage
[41:52] no lineage form
[41:54] then you you gentile has no lineage
[41:57] formed
[41:58] does anybody understand what i mean by
[41:59] that really the jews had a lens that was
[42:01] god's chosen he said out of all the
[42:03] world i chose you as a nation
[42:07] but he didn't choose nobody else he gave
[42:09] them circumcision he gave them signs he
[42:12] done everything
[42:13] all right but see then the only place
[42:15] that we can come in
[42:17] is uh talking about the book of ruth
[42:21] see but see boaz
[42:24] he didn't
[42:26] he couldn't
[42:27] pay the price for for ruth
[42:31] i mean
[42:32] because she had no lineage right right
[42:35] all right
[42:36] see her husband she went over and
[42:37] married her oh man you don't think they
[42:40] had no no life no everything was gone
[42:42] all right but yet see she was a
[42:45] he was a gentile in other words
[42:47] all right so then what happened he had
[42:50] to purchase naomi
[42:53] all right in purchase in naomi which was
[42:56] an israelite right
[42:58] then
[42:59] if if naomi was going to give
[43:02] ruth anything
[43:04] the
[43:05] then boaz would be buying that portion
[43:08] right and see i don't know what the name
[43:10] of the other one was but or peterson or
[43:13] see she went back
[43:15] she went back to her people she was
[43:17] gentile she went back to her people she
[43:19] had no uh
[43:21] it's not even discussed anymore her
[43:23] position is not in no types and shadows
[43:25] or or anything it's just it's left that
[43:28] way all right
[43:30] but see
[43:31] when boaz paid the price he paid the
[43:33] price for naomi
[43:36] all right
[43:37] but she paying the price for naomi then
[43:39] naomi could
[43:42] bring in ruth
[43:47] because of being her
[43:49] daughter-in-law
[43:51] she could bring her in
[43:53] and then boaz could take naomi and then
[43:57] he would automatically get ruth
[43:59] because that was in the family ruth had
[44:02] no
[44:02] property lineage
[44:05] you could say well he did it to her
[44:06] husband you know
[44:08] but still she was a gentile
[44:11] so you you have trouble connecting her
[44:13] to the israelites because it's all for
[44:15] tangent right and see that's what i love
[44:17] about the bible and every so often down
[44:18] through there you gotta wrap the harlot
[44:21] you got a ruth and you've got the things
[44:23] that the gentiles are just you know
[44:26] hearing under you've got all of the
[44:27] mighty men of david and them being
[44:30] gentiles and you you got them being
[44:32] shown here in yonder you know
[44:34] and i love that because it meant it's
[44:35] coming down right but get the point now
[44:38] then we'll start into the message
[44:40] so when i come back to it
[44:43] then you won't misunderstand it
[44:45] see the spirit of adoption
[44:47] brings us into the family
[44:50] it is not your adoption right
[44:54] it is the spirit of adoption
[44:57] all right
[44:58] that would bring us into the family
[45:01] so you can say we're adopted into the
[45:03] family
[45:04] see
[45:06] because that's what we are
[45:08] we had no way of getting into the family
[45:11] jesus christ paid the price
[45:13] to bring us into the family that's right
[45:16] all right so now if everybody will
[45:18] follow with me it won't be confusing
[45:20] when i get back to the other and really
[45:22] start laying it down hard and i will at
[45:24] the end of the message to make sure you
[45:25] don't misunderstand me
[45:28] but the point i want to make to you is
[45:30] one thing
[45:31] i want us to talk about
[45:33] uh
[45:35] something present tense
[45:37] you know it's good to talk about his
[45:39] weight said about abraham and all that
[45:41] but that's all a good story
[45:43] but i want to talk about something
[45:45] present tense and that's why i love the
[45:47] scripture like it is
[45:49] we read there in ephesians
[45:52] that we were predestinated
[45:54] unto
[45:56] adoption
[45:58] all right now brother branham
[46:01] says
[46:03] and it's right above one of the quotes
[46:05] we'll give it a minute
[46:07] he said unto
[46:09] what does that mean
[46:11] he said unto means something
[46:14] we are coming
[46:15] unto
[46:17] you
[46:19] i go unto
[46:20] the water fountain
[46:23] or something like that
[46:24] it's a word meaning that you're not
[46:27] fully fire
[46:29] but yet you're in the travel part of it
[46:33] you know
[46:34] and you're moving toward it
[46:36] something we're coming unto
[46:39] all right
[46:40] now
[46:42] this day
[46:45] this is the hour that the whole world
[46:47] has been waiting on
[46:48] all right right
[46:50] for someone to come unto
[46:53] full sonship
[46:55] we've had sonship
[46:57] we've had a new birth
[47:00] right
[47:01] every ages had the new birth
[47:05] but yet
[47:06] it's something that's not right yet
[47:08] that's right and and here we are at the
[47:11] end time
[47:12] and and you know
[47:14] i like to do this and once why like
[47:16] the series i've done on the book of
[47:18] revelations where you know that if you
[47:20] want to find your book
[47:22] and read the book of revelations because
[47:24] that's the bride's book i love that you
[47:26] know the bride's book is the book of
[47:28] revelations because you just all you got
[47:30] to do is just get in there and
[47:31] understand what it's talking about
[47:33] you've never find jesus in the book of
[47:35] revelation by himself
[47:38] you always find him in somebody with
[47:40] somebody
[47:42] because at that time he's already joined
[47:44] up
[47:45] now
[47:46] but notice it says we're predestinated
[47:48] on two
[47:49] right
[47:51] all right now that scripture
[47:55] to me now
[47:56] is pointing to the day and you and i
[48:00] are living in right
[48:02] all right
[48:04] now
[48:05] uh israel was predestinated
[48:09] to a point
[48:11] of what they were and how they done
[48:14] i mean
[48:20] the prophets
[48:22] were predestinated
[48:24] i haven't got that message yet remember
[48:26] the fifo ministry and the prophets
[48:27] because they're predestinated
[48:30] unto that place
[48:32] and you know
[48:33] uh the the gifts are pretty estimated
[48:36] the fifo ministries predestinated
[48:38] word of god all right amen
[48:42] now
[48:43] listen
[48:45] see this scripture is pointing to now
[48:47] right
[48:49] because
[48:51] look what the prophet says now
[48:54] off the message adoption now
[48:57] i'm using this and i will try to get
[49:00] back to the other because me and brother
[49:02] joe we
[49:03] we you know i wish we could transfer
[49:05] over
[49:06] but
[49:07] it's not that i love the other printing
[49:09] up of the way the the
[49:11] different
[49:13] things of the message is but this one is
[49:17] taken from the latest version from voice
[49:19] of god recordings
[49:21] and that's fine but the difference is in
[49:23] paragraphs and titles sometimes
[49:26] in a minute we'll get down to one that's
[49:27] called adoption
[49:29] and really in the old references that i
[49:32] use or the other
[49:33] uh form or whatever you call the the
[49:35] message
[49:36] it uses it manifested sons so sometimes
[49:39] it's confusing and brother joe is having
[49:42] to transfer it over to word that people
[49:44] will pick it up you know
[49:46] because there's two different it's not
[49:48] two different versions now and
[49:50] everything's basically the same some
[49:52] paragraphs are a tad bit different
[49:55] because it's a new revised version
[49:58] coming straight from voice of god
[49:59] recordings and i like it but let's say
[50:02] that it just changes the titles
[50:04] sometimes and if it don't wind up the
[50:06] same paragraph for you and on the
[50:08] internet
[50:09] you know you hear something and it don't
[50:10] wind up with the same message look at
[50:12] the date always give the date the date
[50:15] will be the same where it calls it
[50:17] adoption three or something like that or
[50:19] it calls it manifested sons look at the
[50:22] date i think it's 4 18.
[50:24] look at the date on it
[50:26] and if you miss a paragraph a half or so
[50:29] you know what we've had to do with the
[50:31] old seal book
[50:32] the old seal book when they put out the
[50:34] new seal book it's got the same words in
[50:37] it but it's got different paragraphs
[50:40] and you say page 40 and it might be page
[50:43] 42 in the new one you know
[50:46] so you know bear with us we do the best
[50:48] we can because
[50:49] if you leave everything on the old style
[50:52] the new style is off if you go to all
[50:54] new style the old style is off so we
[50:56] have troubles i i can't help it
[50:59] they decided to do those things i just
[51:01] try to tell you what's taking place so
[51:03] if i give you a paragraph number and
[51:05] it's not the same please look around
[51:08] until you find it don't say well that
[51:10] was wrong mine says this
[51:12] well i'm reading from a different thing
[51:14] or something
[51:16] but this message is
[51:18] number one on your notes it's adoption
[51:20] number four see it won't be called that
[51:22] a lot of times in the other style he'll
[51:25] give you a title
[51:26] but here's the
[51:28] today
[51:30] it's 5 22 the evening service 1960.
[51:34] now listen to what brother ryan says
[51:36] tell me my brother
[51:37] tell me my sister
[51:39] when was the time that the sons of god
[51:41] was ever to be manifested
[51:43] outside of this time now
[51:48] now you could stop right there
[51:50] and you could say brother branham
[51:53] we've had sons of godhold since calvary
[51:56] you taught us that
[51:59] that's right
[52:00] but he's telling us
[52:02] of what this age is right right all
[52:06] right
[52:07] everything in the bible's point to this
[52:08] age
[52:11] so now he's telling you about this age
[52:14] so that's what i'm saying this is this
[52:16] is a message to try to bring us update
[52:19] present tense time
[52:20] and you'll see why i'll make a few
[52:22] statements in a moment
[52:24] outside of this time where was there
[52:26] ever a time in the history
[52:29] this
[52:31] manifest that
[52:31] time to deliver all nature so now you
[52:34] see what he's pointing to
[52:36] this is pointing to the end time
[52:39] to deliver all nature
[52:42] all right
[52:44] nature the nature itself is groaning
[52:45] waiting for the time of the
[52:46] manifestation why
[52:48] before the atonement was made before the
[52:50] holy ghost was ever poured out
[52:52] before all the old testament on down
[52:55] there
[52:56] there couldn't have been manifestation
[52:59] it had to wait till this time
[53:03] now what's he talking about
[53:05] you don't find the word adoption written
[53:07] in here in this quote
[53:11] you find him dealing with the end time
[53:16] the manifestation of the sons and
[53:18] daughters of god
[53:20] all right which is here now the end time
[53:24] all right
[53:25] he's not dealing in this message talking
[53:28] about
[53:29] who's born again who ain't born again
[53:31] what's doing he's telling you what the
[53:33] world's waiting on he's telling you what
[53:35] we're all waiting on what the
[53:37] manifestation of the sons and daughters
[53:39] of god
[53:40] all right
[53:41] now what
[53:43] a time to deliver
[53:46] right
[53:47] a time to deliver
[53:49] all right
[53:50] see there couldn't have been
[53:51] manifestation
[53:52] he hadn't waited this time
[53:54] all the things have been brought
[53:56] coming shaping up to a headstone
[54:00] to the manifestation of sons of god
[54:03] coming back
[54:04] and the spirit of god coming into these
[54:06] men so perfectly until their ministry
[54:09] will be so close like christ
[54:11] they'll it'll join him and his church
[54:14] together
[54:15] all right
[54:17] now
[54:18] pointing to our day
[54:20] so don't get tied up in what is this and
[54:23] what is that
[54:24] okay
[54:26] stay with me of what i'm trying to bring
[54:30] all right
[54:31] don't say well i thought this or i
[54:33] thought that just just stay with me and
[54:34] listen we'll get back to those things
[54:37] and cover them in detail
[54:40] i'm talking about predestinated
[54:43] unto
[54:45] adoption
[54:48] a pacific a
[54:50] specific place
[54:53] time event
[54:55] that the world has been waiting on
[54:58] if everything's waiting on
[55:01] i mean
[55:03] kind to this age
[55:05] we'll get to the scripture in a minute
[55:07] on a lot of things right
[55:10] now
[55:12] the word of god is i'm saying
[55:15] those prophets as they walked out there
[55:18] with that word of god
[55:20] they really were the word for their age
[55:27] and the people took that word
[55:31] and they became the word of that age
[55:36] and you could say well our david was he
[55:38] he killed goliath that's right he didn't
[55:40] kill all the rest of the philistines
[55:44] see the people caught on to the message
[55:47] and they became the word of the age they
[55:49] were living
[55:51] all right
[55:52] moses went up into the mountain come
[55:54] back
[55:56] all right
[55:57] he had the message
[55:59] but you know what
[56:02] a lot of times that people didn't want
[56:03] to follow that message so they died in
[56:05] the wilderness right but those who
[56:07] wanted to follow it went into the
[56:09] promised land right all right
[56:11] so now get the point no matter what we
[56:14] claim a message to the hour
[56:17] thank god
[56:18] but if you and i don't become that
[56:20] message
[56:22] amen right then
[56:24] god has done his part everything's done
[56:27] it's our responsibility
[56:30] okay
[56:31] see and we must recognize our day in
[56:34] this message
[56:36] this is not the age of martin luther
[56:39] right right
[56:41] this is not the age of john wesley
[56:43] pentecost himself
[56:45] this is the age to work that were
[56:47] promised to come
[56:49] to a total deliverance
[56:51] of even nature
[56:54] we've seen it in a manifestation drew
[56:57] the prophet
[56:59] in the basis of speaking things into
[57:01] existence of a
[57:05] bull running at him and god conquered
[57:07] the book through love and the bees
[57:11] nature etc
[57:11] its master for a moment but he said
[57:14] these things that you've seen when
[57:15] they'll be seen in its fullness
[57:18] you know right
[57:20] all right
[57:21] so being predestinated on two
[57:26] we are still in the tribal stages
[57:30] but somewhere somebody one day has got
[57:32] to come to the place to say this is that
[57:35] that's right
[57:37] i like the way brother said it he said
[57:39] you know he'd be saying that of the
[57:40] scripture where they said this is that
[57:42] you know
[57:43] learn the book of acts i think it isn't
[57:45] he said if this ain't that
[57:47] let me keep this until that gets here
[57:50] all right but i i think he believed that
[57:53] was that don't you right all right
[57:56] see we've got to be positive
[57:59] i'm trying to get us to a point just
[58:01] today to be positive this is on the mind
[58:04] all right so this is what i want to try
[58:05] to bring out
[58:09] that
[58:10] this is the hour right
[58:12] this is the time right
[58:14] no matter how bad we look
[58:18] no matter about what you think
[58:20] see people are saying you ain't got
[58:22] nothing i ain't got nothing
[58:24] well there's one thing about it we're
[58:26] still here
[58:29] we're not doing like a lot of churches
[58:30] and cutting down on their services and
[58:32] having less and less
[58:33] if it's possible we'd have more and more
[58:36] and we'll have more services this year
[58:38] because we haven't had it right good
[58:40] friday and saturday the sunday services
[58:42] and then we're gonna have a
[58:44] fellowship meetings and then we're gonna
[58:45] have a fourth of july time and hey man
[58:48] hey we're going to have a saturday and a
[58:51] sunday for that
[58:52] we're putting in more services
[58:55] and it wouldn't bother me if we had
[58:56] church every night
[58:59] i know that'd be rough on the body
[59:01] but
[59:02] i thought we believed that we had to go
[59:04] to church and do more
[59:07] as we sing the time approaching
[59:09] not do like the world that drops off and
[59:12] do but that's that's all right that's
[59:13] that's your business
[59:16] see what i'm going to try to do now is
[59:18] speak of the word
[59:20] or what is to be predestinated
[59:23] for this time
[59:26] now remember
[59:27] if it's predestinated
[59:30] that means there's nothing satan can do
[59:35] to stop that from taking place
[59:39] he can do a lot of trying but he can't
[59:41] stop it
[59:42] might cause his predestination all right
[59:44] remember it's not the person
[59:48] that comes predestinated eternally
[59:51] that's what 152 i think or something in
[59:53] the church's book
[59:55] but the word or seed
[59:58] all right
[59:58] and then being a word or seed
[1:00:01] then
[1:00:02] someone has to make that word
[1:00:04] manifest
[1:00:07] so what part of the word is for us
[1:00:10] okay
[1:00:12] you've heard right around and say that
[1:00:15] moses didn't build an ark
[1:00:17] and float the children of israel out of
[1:00:19] egypt right
[1:00:21] he said that was noah's day
[1:00:25] all right
[1:00:27] but they had a word to be fulfilled
[1:00:30] of going to the promised land
[1:00:32] now
[1:00:35] martin luther brought a message to the
[1:00:37] just to live by faith
[1:00:40] john wesley come along standing on that
[1:00:43] part of the word now not rejecting it
[1:00:45] that he rejected it he would have moses
[1:00:48] rejected the god that brought the
[1:00:50] children and brought him over in the ark
[1:00:53] right then he would reject the word like
[1:00:55] me it was all apart
[1:00:57] so
[1:00:58] john wesley believed in justification
[1:01:00] preaching justification
[1:01:04] but then he received the message of
[1:01:06] sanctification
[1:01:08] all right
[1:01:09] now
[1:01:10] pentecostal possessive street baptism of
[1:01:13] the holy ghost etc
[1:01:16] then you had the prophet coming in in
[1:01:18] his day and time
[1:01:20] thing
[1:01:22] and all of that is part of the word of
[1:01:23] god right
[1:01:24] and each one was predestinated
[1:01:28] the just shall live by faith was the
[1:01:30] predestinated word of god which meant
[1:01:33] there was no way
[1:01:34] that that wasn't going to happen right
[1:01:36] amen i don't care what anybody thinks
[1:01:39] it was going to happen why because god
[1:01:41] predestinated
[1:01:43] me and martin luther was the man that by
[1:01:45] foreknowledge he would fall into
[1:01:49] so he and his message become one
[1:01:53] right
[1:01:54] then the people in the message become
[1:01:55] one right
[1:01:57] all right right see so is it whatever
[1:01:59] age no that's right
[1:02:01] all right then in doing that
[1:02:05] we must find where we're at that's right
[1:02:09] we have a word to be fulfilled
[1:02:12] all right
[1:02:13] so now i gave you some quotes
[1:02:16] we're brought around and said he talks
[1:02:17] about
[1:02:20] like there's a man here that can turn on
[1:02:21] the lights 1963
[1:02:23] 12 29 paragraph 105
[1:02:26] now in all ages
[1:02:28] god has set for some
[1:02:30] so set forth so much of his word for
[1:02:34] each age
[1:02:36] god always sends somebody
[1:02:38] that that word can get into
[1:02:40] and show the light of it
[1:02:42] that every age it does the same thing
[1:02:45] always does that so there's a word for
[1:02:48] every age
[1:02:50] you say well we're just sitting here
[1:02:52] waiting
[1:02:53] for a bus to pull up you know
[1:02:56] well now that was what martin luther
[1:02:58] said that's right he set the world on
[1:03:00] fire with justification
[1:03:03] because we just go to church if we want
[1:03:05] to
[1:03:06] if we don't want to we don't need to
[1:03:08] we can always listen to the days we can
[1:03:11] you know okay
[1:03:14] that's your choice
[1:03:17] because we're going to prove what we are
[1:03:19] see
[1:03:20] all right
[1:03:23] when god spoke through the prophets
[1:03:26] they were the word that's underlined in
[1:03:28] that same quote and they made that
[1:03:31] manifest for the day that they were
[1:03:33] living in okay
[1:03:36] turn on the lies preached in 1964 125
[1:03:39] paragraph 33.
[1:03:42] we want to talk about this morning is
[1:03:43] rejecting this light
[1:03:45] by them it's sent to reject see it
[1:03:49] and it's just like it was then
[1:03:52] they reject a lot all right but we take
[1:03:54] the light
[1:03:56] he was the light of the world but he was
[1:03:58] rejected all right
[1:04:00] and it meets that condition every time
[1:04:03] that god maintains his light
[1:04:06] the light that the world itself rejects
[1:04:08] that light
[1:04:10] why it's written right in the bible
[1:04:13] each age god has allotted so much of his
[1:04:16] word for each age and he always sends
[1:04:18] somebody to make that word manifest
[1:04:22] all right
[1:04:23] now
[1:04:25] read all the rest of them down to there
[1:04:26] like christ
[1:04:28] is identified the same
[1:04:30] 64 418 paragraph 95.
[1:04:34] god unlocks his word for the age when
[1:04:36] that word is ready to be manifested
[1:04:39] now search the scriptures
[1:04:41] don't just take my word
[1:04:42] when that word is ready to be manifested
[1:04:45] then god sends down a prophet and
[1:04:47] reveals the word to the prophet
[1:04:50] so we've had the prophet
[1:04:56] we're not in the word of the age of
[1:04:59] the prophet
[1:05:00] now there are people that are just
[1:05:02] receiving the message
[1:05:04] remember unto means you're traveling
[1:05:06] that's right there are people that are
[1:05:08] just hearing about the prophet
[1:05:11] we've got to have that right amen all
[1:05:14] right
[1:05:15] but for everybody it's not god sent a
[1:05:17] prophet what's your message god sent a
[1:05:19] prophet
[1:05:21] no i like the way they said it in in
[1:05:24] india to the brothers and them said
[1:05:25] you've told us that god sent a prophet
[1:05:27] and i've sent somebody over here to tell
[1:05:29] us what that prophet taught in china i
[1:05:31] think what china yeah right right
[1:05:34] but now think about it
[1:05:38] the word of each age there's a bunch
[1:05:40] more quotes down through there
[1:05:42] two more about the word of the age
[1:05:45] all right now
[1:05:47] the word of the age
[1:05:49] would be made manifest by somebody
[1:05:53] all right so we're not in martin
[1:05:55] luther's age
[1:05:56] we're not in john wesley's age we
[1:05:58] believe it right we're not in azusa
[1:06:01] street pentecostal age
[1:06:05] we're not in the age of god sent a
[1:06:07] prophet
[1:06:09] i've explained that so you cut yourself
[1:06:11] off do what you want to
[1:06:13] i've explained that so people will just
[1:06:16] click and on the brain you don't believe
[1:06:18] it not
[1:06:19] we should be through that that's for you
[1:06:21] to do if that's what you're doing
[1:06:23] explain to the world that god sent a
[1:06:25] prophet
[1:06:26] but somebody's got to move on
[1:06:30] to what the prophet taught
[1:06:32] all right now because in this age then
[1:06:35] there would be a word for this age right
[1:06:39] all right
[1:06:40] now
[1:06:42] i lost my notes so forget that
[1:06:44] in this age
[1:06:46] we're to the age of work
[1:06:48] what
[1:06:49] didn't love this one what is it
[1:06:52] hebrews 11 40.
[1:06:55] they without us could not be made
[1:06:57] perfect that's
[1:06:58] right they could not be brought to
[1:07:01] completion without us right
[1:07:03] the fifo ministry according to ephesians
[1:07:07] is for the perfecting of the saints
[1:07:10] all right
[1:07:11] so there has to be a predestinated
[1:07:13] firefighter ministry right now not
[1:07:15] everybody i told you
[1:07:19] there were probably a lot of people in
[1:07:20] the days of martin luther protested the
[1:07:22] catholic church had little uprisings and
[1:07:24] like that sure
[1:07:26] and we're not against it
[1:07:28] but there was nobody with the message
[1:07:30] that was predestinated
[1:07:32] right
[1:07:33] for that hour
[1:07:34] but martin luther
[1:07:38] he got that message probably by
[1:07:40] listening to somebody else
[1:07:42] but then god spoke and
[1:07:45] you know they wasn't just sitting back
[1:07:47] there well we do we have no no no they
[1:07:49] were studying the bible
[1:07:51] right
[1:07:52] and and and all of the people and things
[1:07:55] but see when god quickened that that was
[1:07:57] the light of that age
[1:08:00] that was the salvation of that age
[1:08:03] all right
[1:08:04] now when it comes into wesley's time
[1:08:06] you've got overflows
[1:08:08] you know not just grew up dropped in you
[1:08:10] got overflows
[1:08:12] but in the days of john wesley john
[1:08:15] wesley taught justification
[1:08:20] his message was not just well folks we
[1:08:22] don't need luther no more we're
[1:08:24] sanctified now
[1:08:27] looser said you sitting up looser
[1:08:30] sitting in the pub drinking beer
[1:08:32] smoking a pie going beyond that days
[1:08:34] he's lost and gone
[1:08:36] no
[1:08:37] no
[1:08:39] john wesley believed luther's message
[1:08:42] but god was ready to move on the scene
[1:08:45] to advance the word
[1:08:48] the word was going to open
[1:08:50] and it did so it was just the street so
[1:08:52] was it with brother brown
[1:08:55] but now we're in what is called the
[1:08:56] bride age
[1:08:58] at every age had a bright age
[1:09:02] there was a bright age at every age with
[1:09:04] a bride birth into that message of the
[1:09:06] age which birthed them out of the age
[1:09:10] there was no bride ever in an age
[1:09:13] well they lived yeah we're still living
[1:09:15] here right here
[1:09:17] my brother said i'm not from mexico the
[1:09:20] lady will see him
[1:09:23] he was bringing the message to the bride
[1:09:25] this is the bright ages on the sill book
[1:09:27] he said i call your bride
[1:09:32] now
[1:09:32] see then
[1:09:34] the scripture is pointing down here to
[1:09:36] something's got to take place
[1:09:39] well we're just i said we're just
[1:09:40] sitting here waiting on the bus
[1:09:42] they got all kind of definitions
[1:09:45] of what that is
[1:09:48] i mean
[1:09:50] this has got to happen that's going to
[1:09:51] happen this got to be done that's got to
[1:09:52] be well what if it don't happen
[1:09:59] right
[1:10:01] we could be sitting waiting on the bus
[1:10:02] that don't pull up
[1:10:06] i mean
[1:10:07] i just always try to be honest with you
[1:10:09] with everybody
[1:10:13] i believe what the prophet said
[1:10:17] but i want that word revealed into my
[1:10:19] heart
[1:10:20] to see who i am
[1:10:22] because knowing who brother branham was
[1:10:24] won't save me
[1:10:27] to knowing who jesus christ was won't
[1:10:30] save me
[1:10:31] all right
[1:10:33] to be able to make a a uh
[1:10:35] discourse speech and bring him all the
[1:10:38] way down and bring him right down into a
[1:10:40] cradle and write out and up over the
[1:10:42] words that and won't save nobody
[1:10:45] it's got to be a personal experience in
[1:10:47] your heart of the baptism of the holy
[1:10:49] ghost to bring salvation to you benign
[1:10:53] in other words your words got to be made
[1:10:54] alive
[1:10:56] all right and that's part of the word to
[1:10:58] be made alive here at this time
[1:11:01] you and i are not to make those others
[1:11:03] manifest we believe all of the others
[1:11:07] i was in the funeral brother maloney i
[1:11:09] think her sister maloney one and the
[1:11:10] undertaker said by the way what are you
[1:11:14] i said i'm a method baptized pestering
[1:11:16] pentecostal
[1:11:19] he said i'm sure i hate to write that on
[1:11:21] your death certificate i said i don't
[1:11:23] intend for you
[1:11:26] i intend to be changed
[1:11:29] because that's
[1:11:30] that's what my my hopes are
[1:11:33] it's based on it
[1:11:34] if i'm not don't let me hinder those
[1:11:36] again
[1:11:37] but there's a word for every age to be
[1:11:40] made alive and there's a word for this
[1:11:42] age
[1:11:43] if it wasn't for one scripture day
[1:11:45] without us
[1:11:46] cannot be made perfect that's right
[1:11:48] that places somebody
[1:11:50] into a place
[1:11:52] a position of what we read
[1:11:55] that were would it be brother rather
[1:11:57] said
[1:11:58] outside of this age
[1:12:02] of the manifestation of the sons and
[1:12:04] daughters of god coming to the headstone
[1:12:06] he said
[1:12:08] they would bring it to a position to
[1:12:10] work that would fulfill all the
[1:12:12] scriptures
[1:12:17] but in doing that
[1:12:21] can we see the age we're living that's
[1:12:23] right
[1:12:24] that's it we are predestinated on two
[1:12:30] a place must be reached in this age
[1:12:34] that adoption comes to full sunshine
[1:12:39] that they can control nature right
[1:12:42] here's where we're going to get into it
[1:12:44] a minute but that's
[1:12:46] all right
[1:12:48] where they can do this that or the other
[1:12:50] right well brother brown wouldn't have
[1:12:51] done it
[1:12:54] well if that would be true
[1:12:56] that would still be enough to make sure
[1:12:58] the word was made manifest for the age
[1:13:00] right
[1:13:02] no problem
[1:13:05] but we could stand here all afternoon
[1:13:09] and talk about the things that god has
[1:13:10] done among us
[1:13:13] but do you ever put it together to think
[1:13:15] about that maybe god is with us
[1:13:20] right
[1:13:22] i mean we've seen everything in the book
[1:13:24] in this little building
[1:13:27] we've had the word of the lord
[1:13:30] it says it won't rain until i called for
[1:13:32] it
[1:13:34] and then i stood right here and told you
[1:13:35] i said you better roll your windows up
[1:13:37] because i can't fart and it's coming
[1:13:40] but see what well brother you think
[1:13:42] you're probably oh i told you not one
[1:13:44] i'm a child of god
[1:13:48] why do you want to go to all junk like
[1:13:49] that i thought it was for all of them
[1:13:55] where you trying to make something out
[1:13:56] yourself i don't have to make nothing
[1:13:58] out of myself
[1:14:01] no fella said one time he said ain't no
[1:14:03] brag it's just facts
[1:14:05] if i stand here and tell you facts and
[1:14:07] you've been live with me and can't deny
[1:14:10] there's one sitting right there that i
[1:14:12] said he'll come to god
[1:14:16] i told him i said he'll be a preacher in
[1:14:18] the pulpit with me
[1:14:21] see we don't want to look at that
[1:14:24] well that just lucky guess well i told
[1:14:26] joyce that danny's coming so that's all
[1:14:27] about two of them
[1:14:30] what does he do to everybody because god
[1:14:32] ain't told me
[1:14:33] i tell it when he tells me
[1:14:36] and sometimes i don't even tell you
[1:14:37] everything he does tell me why because
[1:14:40] you get built on well brother dale's got
[1:14:42] it i'm not trying to tell you i got it
[1:14:44] i'm trying to tell you god's got it
[1:14:48] but i'm trying to tell you to get out of
[1:14:49] the thing and then you're you're
[1:14:51] thinking in your mind well brother
[1:14:52] branham's only one could do this right
[1:14:54] around
[1:15:04] i'm just trying to tell you the truth
[1:15:06] i'm trying to get you to see the god
[1:15:07] that's in your life
[1:15:11] what was it sister brenda you standing
[1:15:13] there the lord spoke to you about
[1:15:14] something
[1:15:15] why can't we play that right
[1:15:18] you mean he'd do that
[1:15:20] he only spoke to the prophet
[1:15:26] what
[1:15:28] you know the only reason they don't
[1:15:29] speak to people because they don't
[1:15:30] believe that's right
[1:15:33] amen you blame god
[1:15:36] for not speaking to you maybe you ain't
[1:15:38] got out of your carnality enough to get
[1:15:40] where god can speak to you
[1:15:43] i've never tried to get you to come here
[1:15:45] on because of signs and wonders that's
[1:15:47] right i told you about it we had a
[1:15:48] brother come here from years
[1:15:50] and i begged god not to do nothing while
[1:15:51] he's here because all he do is go out
[1:15:53] and run his mouth and he causes a lot of
[1:15:55] trouble because sign seekers come
[1:15:56] running in
[1:15:59] and then they get pictures want to take
[1:16:01] cameras they want that you don't try to
[1:16:02] find a pill or a fire with a drought
[1:16:14] you're exactly right i don't want you
[1:16:16] here unless it's a word
[1:16:19] if it ain't the words you come here for
[1:16:20] you're going to hinder me and i'm going
[1:16:22] to hinder you
[1:16:24] you need money to go somewhere left let
[1:16:25] me know ahead
[1:16:27] that's as plain as i can be
[1:16:30] that means i ain't building up nothing
[1:16:33] i'm just me
[1:16:34] and i'm sorry
[1:16:37] i know i'm not what you think about a
[1:16:38] pastor i'm the first one to say that
[1:16:42] but i've done the best i could try to do
[1:16:44] to show you god amen but i'm trying
[1:16:46] today to show you this is the time
[1:16:49] when are we going to believe it's the
[1:16:50] time
[1:16:51] why we've been here 40 years
[1:16:54] after the prophet's gone 40 something
[1:16:56] years now
[1:16:57] because we're not ready
[1:17:00] because we're not believing what god
[1:17:01] says
[1:17:03] oh if i could just see
[1:17:08] you'll never see it
[1:17:09] right
[1:17:11] god draws millions of gallons of water
[1:17:13] out of the ocean every day never makes
[1:17:14] one sound
[1:17:20] you didn't go around broadcasting this
[1:17:21] stuff
[1:17:23] i mean
[1:17:26] but there's a word for the age lighted
[1:17:28] for the age on the earth
[1:17:31] and somebody
[1:17:33] has to be here to make that live that's
[1:17:35] what he says in
[1:17:37] the feast of the trumpets let's read
[1:17:38] that in 64 719 in the morning service
[1:17:41] paragraph 57 sits on your note
[1:17:44] you remember god is the word and each
[1:17:46] age has plotted the word for each a he
[1:17:50] has lotted the word free change
[1:17:52] that would be on the earth he lighted it
[1:17:54] in the church ages and the seven seals
[1:17:57] revealed every bit of it that's right
[1:18:01] that's what the seals was about right
[1:18:04] the seals is to reveal and show us the
[1:18:06] age
[1:18:09] the time that we're
[1:18:10] living the position that we're expected
[1:18:14] to be in
[1:18:15] right yep
[1:18:19] you don't have to do anything
[1:18:22] let god do it amen
[1:18:25] why i was reading her this morning said
[1:18:27] i'd like to spend a lot of time she's
[1:18:29] pentecostals and only pentecost
[1:18:34] they're always looking for signs and
[1:18:35] wonders and things
[1:18:38] get the word first to sign the ones will
[1:18:40] follow it you don't know what to judge
[1:18:42] it by if you don't have the word first
[1:18:45] ain't nobody in the world that don't
[1:18:46] believe in signs and wonders any more
[1:18:48] than this man you're looking at because
[1:18:50] i've told you
[1:18:53] of the things that god has told me to
[1:18:55] come to pass amen
[1:18:57] i've got to believe in him being real
[1:19:01] i told my wife one day i said i'll quit
[1:19:02] preaching if something don't happen she
[1:19:04] said you preached your life certainly
[1:19:06] i said it'll take place or i'll quit
[1:19:10] well she had to admit one day it took
[1:19:12] place
[1:19:13] right
[1:19:16] but you see church when are we going to
[1:19:18] get to the place to believe in where
[1:19:20] we're standing now
[1:19:22] and what we're doing well i just don't
[1:19:25] see it
[1:19:26] look like we have everybody healed in
[1:19:27] the building
[1:19:28] what kind of an idea did you where did
[1:19:30] you get that from
[1:19:33] the closer jesus christ got to calvary
[1:19:36] the worst conditions he lived in
[1:19:40] the older we're getting the worst
[1:19:42] conditions is growing in us right right
[1:19:48] we're expecting to be 100 years old and
[1:19:50] running around with my 21 glory
[1:19:52] hallelujah
[1:19:54] no you know
[1:19:55] glory hallelujah
[1:19:57] i'm still alive
[1:20:00] but that man said that day at work but
[1:20:03] he's talking something about the candle
[1:20:04] he said how many catholics are there i
[1:20:05] said about that time is 500 million he
[1:20:07] said you mean you're all wrong and
[1:20:09] you're right i said
[1:20:10] well i didn't say that
[1:20:13] the word does
[1:20:15] he say well how come you're sick
[1:20:17] i thought for a minute god give me an
[1:20:18] answer i don't think this ain't dead
[1:20:22] he was nice enough man he said i'm sorry
[1:20:24] i shouldn't have said that to you
[1:20:26] i said well it's just the truth
[1:20:28] i'm still alive
[1:20:31] why can't we believe what god is doing
[1:20:33] among us instead of well i'd like to see
[1:20:36] the ears we all have to be healed right
[1:20:39] but the bible says many are the
[1:20:41] afflictions of the righteous
[1:20:43] that don't
[1:20:45] the lord leadeth out of them all
[1:20:49] the reason we're not healed is because
[1:20:50] we're not taking it and getting serious
[1:20:56] all right
[1:20:58] but you see we get sick and we just
[1:21:00] oh i was i wonder what happened
[1:21:04] what have i done wrong
[1:21:06] you're getting older
[1:21:12] and your body is deteriorating if you're
[1:21:15] young
[1:21:18] right
[1:21:20] but you see church we're not looking at
[1:21:22] things as present tense my whole point
[1:21:26] adoption is your placing into the body
[1:21:28] of christ
[1:21:30] right right
[1:21:32] positionally placing
[1:21:34] but yet
[1:21:35] the new birth puts us in the body
[1:21:38] because we were born kin folks to the
[1:21:40] devil he had to bring us into the body
[1:21:43] before you can even speak to us about
[1:21:44] adoption
[1:21:48] the natural israelite was born into the
[1:21:50] family
[1:21:52] they had proselytes i don't know of any
[1:21:54] record they adopted proselytes
[1:21:58] they had proselytes to the religion
[1:22:02] but yet we're not proselytes
[1:22:06] we're the sons and daughters of almighty
[1:22:07] god with a word for the age that we're
[1:22:09] living
[1:22:14] the bible is pointing to you and i
[1:22:17] you want to know what we're here for
[1:22:19] it's pointing to you and i
[1:22:23] having predestinated hush
[1:22:27] us right yes right
[1:22:30] don't worry about luther's age it's done
[1:22:34] wesley's age
[1:22:35] just a street
[1:22:37] around his message
[1:22:39] they've got their message and gone off
[1:22:41] the scene
[1:22:43] but there's a message for you and i to
[1:22:45] be living
[1:22:46] that will not die
[1:22:49] what about in thessalonians
[1:22:53] excuse me what about corinthians right
[1:22:57] the word that you promised not to die
[1:23:02] now why can't we believe that
[1:23:05] what is it first corinthians 15 52.
[1:23:08] we're promised not to die
[1:23:10] amen well that's when you go out you
[1:23:13] talk to people
[1:23:14] and you find out what they believe right
[1:23:17] you get to talk to somebody and they say
[1:23:18] yeah the end of the world's here into
[1:23:20] the world here right yep end of the
[1:23:21] world we're living in the last day you
[1:23:24] start talking to them about the real
[1:23:25] signs
[1:23:27] well
[1:23:28] nobody knows a day or an hour maybe 50
[1:23:30] years from now
[1:23:32] maybe 50 years from now let's take place
[1:23:34] in other words 80 years old and 50 years
[1:23:36] later they're bound to know they're
[1:23:37] going to be here
[1:23:39] nobody wants to think about something
[1:23:40] living present right
[1:23:45] the lord's coming well yeah
[1:23:47] nobody knows today or now
[1:23:51] maybe 20 years from now
[1:23:55] maybe maybe
[1:23:57] no
[1:24:00] see somebody's going to be changed
[1:24:04] in a moment
[1:24:05] in a twinkling of an eye
[1:24:09] now why can't we believe that right
[1:24:13] we do mentally
[1:24:15] right right anyway that's been quoted
[1:24:17] for 2 000 years right
[1:24:24] even the man that quoted it never
[1:24:25] attained unto it
[1:24:27] right
[1:24:28] the one that said it but now i believe
[1:24:31] when he said it
[1:24:33] it was present tense to him
[1:24:37] i believe that
[1:24:39] when he prophesied when a man prophesied
[1:24:41] in the spirit you know and tells you
[1:24:44] what god said that don't matter about
[1:24:47] time elements ages nothing
[1:24:51] to him that is real
[1:24:55] as real as it will ever be that's some
[1:24:58] present tense when god reveals the word
[1:25:01] to you
[1:25:03] that is present tense
[1:25:09] all right you see what i'm talking about
[1:25:15] another brother said to tell you brother
[1:25:18] sister
[1:25:18] outside of this age
[1:25:22] you know
[1:25:23] so he must've been talking about us
[1:25:29] you talking about somebody yeah
[1:25:32] why can't we believe we're that people
[1:25:36] and i've always said with him if i can't
[1:25:38] make it benefit i don't want to stand in
[1:25:40] the way somebody can't right right
[1:25:44] i wouldn't believe it
[1:25:46] if this old boy goes to the grave you
[1:25:48] can better say one thing about the devil
[1:25:50] had a battle yeah
[1:25:53] all right so the boy didn't lay down and
[1:25:54] said well i'm saying you defeated me and
[1:25:56] where that man said i want to fight him
[1:25:58] or something i don't want to bite him on
[1:26:00] my teeth until
[1:26:01] he wears out and then i want to gun him
[1:26:02] to death
[1:26:04] you just ain't going to give up
[1:26:07] zachary he's
[1:26:08] pretty tough now in his age not only big
[1:26:11] but
[1:26:11] when the fellow was little
[1:26:14] you got a hold of him but you better be
[1:26:16] careful
[1:26:18] because he didn't believe in giving up
[1:26:22] and you think you had him
[1:26:23] he gonna hurt you
[1:26:26] because he didn't believe in giving up
[1:26:30] i don't either
[1:26:32] i don't believe in giving up
[1:26:34] that's right i give out i don't believe
[1:26:35] in giving up
[1:26:38] i want to fight him and do everything
[1:26:40] because i believe
[1:26:41] that we're living in the age
[1:26:44] the word time
[1:26:46] and eternity is going to meet all right
[1:26:50] now you're talking about for the world i
[1:26:52] ain't talking about i'm talking about
[1:26:53] for the bride of jesus christ
[1:26:58] time and eternity's got to come together
[1:27:00] heaven and earth is going to kiss again
[1:27:04] because it dead back there in a man
[1:27:06] he said what happened back there is
[1:27:08] going to happen again
[1:27:13] but do we believe it all right
[1:27:16] brother says we're sympathetic with it
[1:27:19] right there
[1:27:20] right when i believe the prophet's
[1:27:22] message but what about this well i don't
[1:27:24] know about that what do you mean you
[1:27:25] don't know about it
[1:27:29] the prophet said
[1:27:31] show me one thing i've ever denied about
[1:27:33] what he said
[1:27:34] that's on the internet that's anywhere
[1:27:37] well brother dale you don't believe it i
[1:27:39] didn't say believe it like you do
[1:27:42] i said you show me where i won't say
[1:27:43] what the prophet said
[1:27:47] but you better make sure you know how to
[1:27:48] say what the prophet said
[1:27:51] because i'm going to remind you what he
[1:27:53] did say
[1:27:56] but listen brothers and sisters
[1:28:01] there is a time
[1:28:05] to
[1:28:07] all things
[1:28:09] that's ecclesiastes
[1:28:11] not a time for all things that's
[1:28:13] yeah
[1:28:14] no that's not even scriptural
[1:28:16] there's a time to all things
[1:28:20] if there's a time to cry there's a time
[1:28:22] to sleep there's a time to eat there's
[1:28:23] no
[1:28:24] there's not a time far because of time
[1:28:26] for would mean you could eat it anytime
[1:28:27] you wanted to
[1:28:29] there's a time too
[1:28:31] right all right
[1:28:33] i think this is the time for us to start
[1:28:34] confessing who we are
[1:28:39] well i don't want to say it because if
[1:28:42] i'm not here i'm lying you're lying
[1:28:44] already
[1:28:47] amen
[1:28:48] what's the difference in one lie or the
[1:28:50] other lie
[1:28:53] they said the brother brown said run
[1:28:55] around you told them people as healed he
[1:28:56] said what did you want me to tell them
[1:28:58] that's what the bible says
[1:29:01] he said it's up to them whether they
[1:29:02] believe it or not amen
[1:29:05] he said i told him what the bible says
[1:29:08] amen right
[1:29:11] but you see
[1:29:15] we want some kind of a
[1:29:17] rabbit hat trick that's right
[1:29:20] we want to look for
[1:29:22] something and if it don't happen that
[1:29:25] way
[1:29:28] one of the kids one time i remember
[1:29:30] which one might have been a grandchild
[1:29:31] one of them made a good point out or
[1:29:32] something sometime
[1:29:34] it's funny in a way but wouldn't find it
[1:29:36] but they said papa said you always
[1:29:37] talking about the lord could come any
[1:29:39] time he said then you turn around and
[1:29:40] say this certain thing got to take place
[1:29:44] well what's your answer
[1:29:47] i was told i said well anything to take
[1:29:50] place in hurry
[1:29:52] things that i said need to take place
[1:29:53] take place in a hurry
[1:29:56] because you can't hinder god
[1:30:00] but you understand
[1:30:02] my point is this
[1:30:05] the word comes predestinated
[1:30:08] eternally
[1:30:12] when martin luther caught that message
[1:30:16] for that day
[1:30:18] of the judge shall live by faith time
[1:30:20] and eternity met
[1:30:24] because there was a man
[1:30:26] standing there that the world was
[1:30:29] against and satan and everything in the
[1:30:32] world was against but they couldn't
[1:30:34] conquer him
[1:30:35] until he brought his message
[1:30:40] he said one of the men down through time
[1:30:42] you know they said don't you know that
[1:30:44] might have been luther said don't you
[1:30:45] know the words against thee said i want
[1:30:46] them to know i'm against them
[1:30:52] he protested the catholic church which
[1:30:54] meant
[1:30:55] excommunication and death
[1:30:58] that's how much he believed what he does
[1:31:01] done what about you and i
[1:31:04] we can't even get to church and live the
[1:31:06] message
[1:31:08] and then we want to blame god and then
[1:31:09] we want to look around i never i've
[1:31:11] never had any trouble
[1:31:14] with laity people talking about the
[1:31:16] message of god
[1:31:18] always preachers that i have trouble
[1:31:19] with right
[1:31:24] my preachers are just dumb enough excuse
[1:31:26] me
[1:31:27] to tell you that they don't agree with
[1:31:29] you
[1:31:30] but they won't tell you why right
[1:31:33] or they'll come up with some idea you
[1:31:35] know
[1:31:36] we were talking about certain brother
[1:31:38] yesterday
[1:31:40] and this brother he boy he was really
[1:31:42] laying it on up here one time and he
[1:31:43] said
[1:31:44] man should see that when joseph was sold
[1:31:46] in slavery
[1:31:48] he said
[1:31:51] first thing it happened said he
[1:31:52] automatically castrated him because he
[1:31:53] wasn't going to have servants around the
[1:31:55] women
[1:31:58] of you heard that
[1:32:00] but you didn't pay no attention
[1:32:03] i said well sure was an odd situation
[1:32:05] when i got a chance to speak i thought
[1:32:07] joseph had two or three kids later
[1:32:10] they must have had some miracle surgery
[1:32:15] what's up everybody oh look at that look
[1:32:17] at that that brother brought me up i've
[1:32:18] never seen that i had neither right
[1:32:21] cause he wasn't true
[1:32:24] same one said
[1:32:26] paul
[1:32:28] that he was married
[1:32:30] the apartment said he'd record he had to
[1:32:31] be married i said i don't give a hoot
[1:32:33] about the sanhedrin because it's wrong
[1:32:35] run around said paul was not
[1:32:38] married took me a while but i found it
[1:32:43] but is that my answer back to him was i
[1:32:45] said i guess what we need to do to go
[1:32:46] home and kill our wives
[1:32:49] because if we can't preach we get if
[1:32:51] we're mad we just go kill our wives
[1:32:55] because paul said be as i am
[1:32:58] you say that's carnal talking plain no
[1:33:00] it's plain language
[1:33:04] because i don't play with the word of
[1:33:06] god
[1:33:07] i don't like jokes and things made out
[1:33:09] of the word of god
[1:33:12] same man said one time they talked about
[1:33:14] them deacons and elders said they have
[1:33:15] to teach he said yeah you got to watch
[1:33:17] them or have to teach that's playing
[1:33:18] with the word of god
[1:33:21] i don't like that
[1:33:22] the word of god to me is serious
[1:33:26] i believe what god said he said there
[1:33:28] was a people and the prophet of god said
[1:33:30] there's a people predestinated
[1:33:33] that means god eternally determined that
[1:33:36] to take pledge
[1:33:39] that there'd be a group of people
[1:33:40] standing on the earth they would face
[1:33:42] death and life at it
[1:33:46] they'd be changed in a moment in a quick
[1:33:48] level
[1:33:51] now we'll get into the adoption and find
[1:33:52] out the reason we're not to that place
[1:33:54] is why because the child's behavior
[1:33:57] is the one that hinders them from coming
[1:33:59] to adoption
[1:34:01] amen
[1:34:04] is that true
[1:34:07] see then it's probably our misbehavior
[1:34:09] brother says misbehavior of unconfessed
[1:34:11] sin
[1:34:12] and you know his definition of sin
[1:34:15] i ain't smoking and gambling
[1:34:18] it's unbelief in god's word
[1:34:21] see i want to say to you today i believe
[1:34:24] this day this scripture is here to be
[1:34:26] fulfilled
[1:34:31] what that we are facing the depth of
[1:34:33] natural things
[1:34:38] and why can't we look at it and see that
[1:34:40] that all of that means that look at all
[1:34:42] these storms around look at all these
[1:34:44] conditions that are happening if you
[1:34:46] can't see we're in a pre-tribulation you
[1:34:48] better open your eyes
[1:34:51] that's right the bible speaks of seven
[1:34:53] thousand people dying in one thing and
[1:34:55] that was a great thing
[1:34:57] two hundred something thousand
[1:35:00] died in that one great earthquake thing
[1:35:02] over there
[1:35:04] look how it's mounting everywhere
[1:35:08] when they say about japan move 13 or 16
[1:35:10] feet toward the united states
[1:35:15] because of that earthquake
[1:35:17] what did it do to us
[1:35:21] everything in the natural you can see me
[1:35:23] oh look at this the paper says this the
[1:35:25] paper
[1:35:26] the bibles well i don't know about that
[1:35:30] i believe what
[1:35:32] garner ken armstrong would say
[1:35:35] i believe what some give a given
[1:35:37] newscaster some non-wonderful courage
[1:35:40] paul harvey
[1:35:41] he ain't working now but
[1:35:43] you know paul irv he said it
[1:35:47] you said what the bible said i don't
[1:35:49] know about that
[1:35:54] right if i could just see
[1:35:58] i'd believe it
[1:36:02] bible didn't say that
[1:36:05] bible says i believe
[1:36:07] to see
[1:36:09] and say i seek to believe that i believe
[1:36:11] to see
[1:36:17] listen folks
[1:36:19] somebody's got to make alive the
[1:36:21] scriptures for this day
[1:36:29] well why can't we believe it
[1:36:32] why can't we say we're the people right
[1:36:34] right
[1:36:36] why can't we say the scriptures that
[1:36:37] we're the people at the end of the world
[1:36:38] just come upon
[1:36:41] somebody's got to say it right
[1:36:46] but we're sitting in our unbelief i'm
[1:36:48] saying well i don't believe you because
[1:36:50] i can't see it
[1:36:53] well you know what you never will see it
[1:37:00] listen folks
[1:37:01] if you ever get the new birth
[1:37:04] as i said it's not a sprinkle of
[1:37:05] goddesses
[1:37:06] if you fall down
[1:37:08] there's ways of going through to get it
[1:37:11] you're going to have to believe
[1:37:13] and you're going to have to confess
[1:37:16] you have to believe you got it confess
[1:37:17] you got it don't got it
[1:37:19] right
[1:37:21] you have to wait till god gives it to
[1:37:23] you
[1:37:28] well then that's the way it is in the
[1:37:29] end time
[1:37:31] i believe there's a group of people
[1:37:33] standing here and i'm going to say this
[1:37:34] and i'll quit because this is the
[1:37:36] message i've got to wait in the notes
[1:37:37] forget them anyway
[1:37:39] see somebody's got to be standing here
[1:37:41] in the end time
[1:37:43] and time and eternity is not together
[1:37:45] together
[1:37:46] it's gonna have to be the word first
[1:37:48] that says it
[1:37:50] because the word don't say it
[1:37:53] forget it
[1:37:55] they're having revivals all over the
[1:37:57] country they're doing all kind of things
[1:37:58] the prophet of god said ain't no
[1:38:00] worldwide revival that's right now
[1:38:02] what's he talking about
[1:38:05] he's talking about the bride
[1:38:09] but listen somebody's gonna stand here
[1:38:11] and say it
[1:38:13] why can't we start saying time and
[1:38:15] eternity's got to me that's right
[1:38:18] all right
[1:38:20] now if i die and go by the grave i'm not
[1:38:22] in this scripture i'm fixing to tell you
[1:38:25] if you're dying going by the grave
[1:38:29] you're not a part of what i'm fixing to
[1:38:30] bring
[1:38:33] okay
[1:38:34] anybody understand
[1:38:38] because you can't believe that you can
[1:38:40] be changed in a moment in 2011.
[1:38:45] dude you got to go by the grave
[1:38:47] no disrespects to nobody if i die
[1:38:50] standing here today don't put over my
[1:38:51] tombstone he died at disgrace no i was
[1:38:54] screaming trying to get you to see it
[1:38:56] if nothing else say he was trying to get
[1:38:59] me to see it
[1:39:01] but somebody
[1:39:03] he's got to look death in the face and
[1:39:05] say
[1:39:07] we're done oh boy
[1:39:10] god's done a reveal to me that i've
[1:39:11] changed
[1:39:15] what if it don't take place
[1:39:20] well what if it does where are you going
[1:39:23] to be
[1:39:25] right
[1:39:26] could i make a big frown or whatever to
[1:39:28] make you understand what i'm saying
[1:39:31] you go out there this evening and then
[1:39:33] you sit down after you say son don't you
[1:39:35] go down i challenge you son don't you go
[1:39:37] down
[1:39:40] you better have your hat to put on dark
[1:39:42] guns cause it's coming
[1:39:44] but if god reveals to you that the sun
[1:39:47] won't go down go out there and say it
[1:39:49] and it won't go down
[1:39:52] right right now but if it's our own
[1:39:55] quotes
[1:39:56] what is it that's right see that's what
[1:39:58] everybody bases it on
[1:40:00] but you see
[1:40:03] if i'm going to make the change now you
[1:40:05] don't want to tell your change
[1:40:10] then you realize and brother gary shake
[1:40:13] yourself on this one okay
[1:40:16] you realize
[1:40:18] i'm standing in the body
[1:40:21] and in one split second i can be
[1:40:24] made eternal
[1:40:26] i don't know how much the twinkling of
[1:40:28] an eye is and everybody's trying to make
[1:40:29] it a blink and what the prophet did what
[1:40:31] who's concerned about how long that is
[1:40:35] it just simply means in a short period
[1:40:42] the best one i heard about it was a
[1:40:43] twinkle in the eye was if you're pro if
[1:40:45] you're staying with a prophet's message
[1:40:47] he's your eye
[1:40:49] that's a good point
[1:40:51] because you know what he believed in it
[1:40:54] he believed any second god could come
[1:40:57] you know what right there was a
[1:40:59] predestinated group of people that had
[1:41:01] to come
[1:41:02] to believe his message
[1:41:05] that would bring him out of the ground
[1:41:06] right here
[1:41:11] but you realize that if
[1:41:12] if you can just see what i'm talking
[1:41:14] about
[1:41:15] if i die i go back to the gases brother
[1:41:18] brown said not necessarily the same
[1:41:21] gases
[1:41:24] but the same 16 elements
[1:41:28] now what's he saying
[1:41:29] you know what i'm fixing to say
[1:41:31] right
[1:41:34] a line in africa jumps on you bites your
[1:41:37] head off and chews it up
[1:41:40] and they throw a dead over him and they
[1:41:42] throw him on an airplane and they fly
[1:41:44] into california
[1:41:48] half your body's in california your head
[1:41:50] and everything else when he uses the
[1:41:52] bathroom is in life us in africa the
[1:41:55] body and the head's in california now
[1:41:56] what are you talking about that to me is
[1:41:58] what rudolph was saying not necessarily
[1:42:00] the same gases but the same elements
[1:42:04] you return back to the gases
[1:42:09] but he'll speak and out of the earth to
[1:42:11] come that body
[1:42:12] but somebody ain't gonna have to do that
[1:42:15] somebody's gonna stand here and say
[1:42:18] i'm changed
[1:42:19] and it'll take place
[1:42:21] there's where time and eternity will
[1:42:23] come together
[1:42:25] but that's a message in the end time
[1:42:27] because you're predestinated unto that
[1:42:29] light in this day
[1:42:35] because there's more to adoption than
[1:42:36] just the manifested sons and daughters
[1:42:38] of god there is a two witness redemption
[1:42:40] in the body we'll get to that
[1:42:43] that's right
[1:42:45] why can't we believe every time an
[1:42:46] eternity meets
[1:42:48] you realize if you're not going to go by
[1:42:50] the grave you're living in the body it's
[1:42:51] going to be changed
[1:42:54] come on that's right
[1:42:58] you're living in the body that's going
[1:42:59] to be changed
[1:43:01] and if you go by the grave you're coming
[1:43:03] back up in the body that you live in
[1:43:09] the only difference is somebody's gonna
[1:43:10] stand here not have to die
[1:43:13] why can't we believe that we're them
[1:43:15] that's right
[1:43:18] why can't we say this is what is
[1:43:20] predestinated unto this age
[1:43:23] lord let me fulfill that amen that's
[1:43:26] right that's right
[1:43:29] let me be what you predestinated me to
[1:43:32] be
[1:43:34] and i'm talking about
[1:43:36] what it's not the person that comes
[1:43:38] predestinated eternally
[1:43:40] with the word receipt but what about
[1:43:42] when the word is eating a person comes
[1:43:44] together
[1:43:46] don't you believe
[1:43:48] that jesus
[1:43:50] was the word
[1:43:52] holding up one hand to show you what i'm
[1:43:53] talking about body at all
[1:43:56] getting that eternity one day
[1:43:59] right
[1:44:01] right
[1:44:02] and he turned around and he said you
[1:44:04] destroy this body
[1:44:06] in three days i'll bring it up
[1:44:09] right
[1:44:13] but somebody don't have to say that
[1:44:16] somebody said i'm changing
[1:44:22] somebody's predestinated
[1:44:24] unto adoption
[1:44:27] now we'll get back to it because he
[1:44:29] predestinated on the sonship
[1:44:31] predestinated unto
[1:44:33] resurrection
[1:44:35] but why can't you say you're
[1:44:37] predestinated
[1:44:41] see this this is the scripture
[1:44:44] where time and ages must meet
[1:44:49] it has to always be this way
[1:44:54] someone will have to confess
[1:44:56] i am the person
[1:44:58] that will not
[1:44:59] go by the grace
[1:45:02] that's right now jesus said you
[1:45:03] destroyed this body three days i'll
[1:45:05] bring it up and he did right right
[1:45:09] well i can't want somebody to be saying
[1:45:11] you can't destroy this fight
[1:45:17] now come on
[1:45:18] i don't care how many bombs they got
[1:45:20] headed this way
[1:45:22] your prophet's done said you're going
[1:45:23] out here in the rapture for one bald
[1:45:25] fall
[1:45:26] he didn't say they come over here and
[1:45:27] make dirty bombs and sneaky bombs blow
[1:45:29] height from new york off the map
[1:45:33] he said before one bomb falls
[1:45:38] right
[1:45:41] we're going out of here
[1:45:43] announced right now seeing people
[1:45:44] disappeared today
[1:45:47] here comes these bombs
[1:45:50] somebody just stand there this is cool
[1:45:51] and says
[1:45:53] that you're scared i don't got here yet
[1:45:58] let's go run word
[1:46:00] amen
[1:46:05] mommy run
[1:46:07] either going to be here in a split
[1:46:08] second get me out of here
[1:46:18] you see what i'm talking about
[1:46:20] in the bible times we talk about people
[1:46:23] who had this great supernatural faith
[1:46:26] that they had beliefs
[1:46:28] they challenged this david killed the
[1:46:29] buyer of the line the giant etc
[1:46:32] we can talk about that a lot
[1:46:38] well why can't we see that they simply
[1:46:41] was believing something present tense
[1:46:47] instead of prophesying right
[1:46:55] like your sister was it said
[1:46:58] no
[1:47:00] don't you understand in 30 minutes we're
[1:47:02] going to be at the bottom of the sea
[1:47:04] or we'll either be in the harbor she was
[1:47:06] rejoicing saying glory hallelujah
[1:47:10] they said why
[1:47:12] she said i got a daughter over in the
[1:47:13] harbor waiting on me said i got a
[1:47:15] daughter in glory
[1:47:17] in 30 minutes i'll be with one of them
[1:47:22] what can you do with a person like that
[1:47:24] that's right
[1:47:27] you might just sleep alone
[1:47:29] oh they're fanatic
[1:47:32] well
[1:47:33] amen what are
[1:47:34] you i like the one where brother brown
[1:47:37] saw the man that thing who had the signs
[1:47:38] and i'm a fool for christ
[1:47:41] he said everybody was turning around and
[1:47:42] looking as a man walked by he said i
[1:47:44] turned around and looked too and he said
[1:47:45] on his back said who's full are you
[1:47:53] now here's my last statement
[1:47:55] all of those in the bible whoever
[1:47:57] amounted to anything or anything ever
[1:47:59] took place either way you want to make
[1:48:01] it brother branham or
[1:48:03] lutheran wesleyan or messengers whatever
[1:48:05] you make it
[1:48:06] there were people
[1:48:08] like you and i
[1:48:10] the people that god had spoke to
[1:48:14] and him speaking to them i mean it was a
[1:48:16] predestinated
[1:48:18] word
[1:48:20] and they believed it
[1:48:24] and that brought eternity
[1:48:27] to them
[1:48:29] what about it
[1:48:35] what about it
[1:48:37] when are we going to start saying who we
[1:48:38] are
[1:48:39] instead of saying what the devil says we
[1:48:41] are
[1:48:43] the devil says you're sick sam whale
[1:48:46] what does the bible say let you redeem
[1:48:48] say so or something like that
[1:48:51] when are we going to start saying what
[1:48:53] the bible says
[1:49:00] well
[1:49:03] somebody will
[1:49:07] why can't i sing a part of it
[1:49:10] i hope you caught what i said a moment
[1:49:12] ago
[1:49:13] if you go by the grave don't
[1:49:15] misunderstand me
[1:49:17] you're not gonna go by the grave being
[1:49:19] five foot tall
[1:49:20] and come up nine foot tall
[1:49:23] you're gonna come back that body
[1:49:25] but it can turn back to ashes and gases
[1:49:28] and things like that
[1:49:31] but god will speak it right out of the
[1:49:32] dust of the earth
[1:49:34] but somebody will be standing there in a
[1:49:37] body
[1:49:39] that will be changed
[1:49:42] that's the message
[1:49:45] to wit the redemption of our body to
[1:49:48] understand
[1:49:50] the redemption of our body
[1:49:54] when we think we're going to get good
[1:49:55] enough
[1:49:58] we think we're going to
[1:49:59] do some magic thing
[1:50:04] you know as i told you in the baptist
[1:50:05] when you paved the parking lot or
[1:50:07] painted the church you automatically got
[1:50:09] a trip to heaven
[1:50:11] they never preached anybody to hell they
[1:50:13] needed a
[1:50:14] pervert of all forms but he never went
[1:50:16] to hell when he died if he painted the
[1:50:18] church or paid the parking lot
[1:50:22] yeah
[1:50:24] but then why can't we
[1:50:26] say who we are by the word
[1:50:28] let's stand
[1:50:31] come into the communion time
[1:50:34] why can't we believe
[1:50:37] he said well brother dale if we had what
[1:50:39] we talk about what we have and people
[1:50:40] said that
[1:50:43] if we have what we think we have why
[1:50:45] ain't things happening
[1:50:48] open your eyes
[1:50:51] how long do you want to stay for me to
[1:50:53] tell you what god has
[1:50:54] done
[1:50:55] through this one person that you see
[1:50:58] that you can't deny it
[1:51:00] that my blood type was totally changed
[1:51:02] from
[1:51:03] a negative to a positive
[1:51:08] that the lord healed my eyesight
[1:51:10] went from where i couldn't even shoot a
[1:51:12] gun with an iron sight because wavy
[1:51:14] outside and for eight years i wore no
[1:51:17] glasses
[1:51:18] and beside that um
[1:51:22] little zach
[1:51:23] little black zach's been wearing glasses
[1:51:26] get him to tell you about it
[1:51:29] and daddy said zach where's he glasses
[1:51:31] he said don't need them no more he said
[1:51:34] i put my glasses on it's all fuzzy
[1:51:41] he's healed
[1:51:43] yeah we don't count down
[1:51:51] what do you need to believe right
[1:51:54] well i ain't for it happened to me we
[1:51:56] didn't believe
[1:52:00] accept it for you
[1:52:03] it's not just for me
[1:52:08] right
[1:52:10] the prophet of god come to speak of a
[1:52:13] bride right
[1:52:14] with somebody
[1:52:17] can be that bride that's right
[1:52:22] but we look at our own
[1:52:25] ignorant ideas and try to figure it out
[1:52:33] there stood a man one day
[1:52:36] and said
[1:52:38] the bible promises this the bible
[1:52:40] promises that
[1:52:42] he said now i want to tell you this day
[1:52:44] this scripture is fulfilled
[1:52:46] right now how many believed
[1:52:50] there's really not a record anybody
[1:52:51] believed in that day that's right
[1:52:55] right right but did that matter to him
[1:52:59] well nobody didn't believe me lord trump
[1:53:01] i guess i said it wrong i need to make
[1:53:03] sure to check up on what to say the next
[1:53:05] time
[1:53:08] he said unless you believe that i am he
[1:53:11] you will die in your sins and i don't
[1:53:14] believe he is smiling when he says
[1:53:21] you see we can talk a lot about what's
[1:53:22] being
[1:53:26] i'm talking about what's here
[1:53:34] i didn't do this 40 years ago
[1:53:39] and i don't do it because 40 years is
[1:53:41] passed on
[1:53:44] somebody start got to start saying it
[1:53:46] we're here
[1:53:49] and if this is the time
[1:53:53] to inherit all nature
[1:53:59] but what's hindering us
[1:54:02] our childhood training
[1:54:05] we're not following the training that
[1:54:07] god wants to give us right
[1:54:11] think on these things let's read the
[1:54:13] scriptures with the community
[1:54:17] and aaron and wade if you would
[1:54:21] forever received with the lord that
[1:54:22] which also i delivered unto you that the
[1:54:24] lord jesus the same night in which he
[1:54:26] was betrayed took bread
[1:54:28] when he had given thanks he break it and
[1:54:30] said take eat this is my body which is
[1:54:32] broken for you this due in remembrance
[1:54:34] of me
[1:54:35] after the same manner also he took the
[1:54:37] cup when he had stopped saying this cup
[1:54:39] is the new testament in my blood this
[1:54:41] dewey is often you drink it in
[1:54:42] remembrance of me
[1:54:44] for as often as that as you eat this
[1:54:46] bread and drink this cup you do shoot
[1:54:47] the lord's death till he come or for
[1:54:50] whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
[1:54:52] this cup of the lord
[1:54:54] unworthily she'll be guilty of the body
[1:54:56] and blood of the lord but let a man
[1:54:58] examine himself and show letting me to
[1:54:59] that bread and drink of that cup for he
[1:55:01] that eateth and drinketh unworthy eateth
[1:55:03] and drink of damnation to himself not
[1:55:05] discerning the lord's body
[1:55:07] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:55:09] among you in many sleep
[1:55:11] for we would judge ourselves we should
[1:55:12] not be judged but when we are judged we
[1:55:15] are chastened to the world that we
[1:55:16] should not be condemned with the world
[1:55:19] where for my brethren when you come
[1:55:21] together to eat tarry one for another
[1:55:23] and if any man hunger let him meet at
[1:55:24] home did you come not together in the
[1:55:26] condemnation and the rest will sit in
[1:55:29] order when i come
[1:55:30] let's just have a few moments of solid
[1:55:32] prayer praying one for the other
[1:55:34] remember
[1:55:35] the sick among us the things
[1:55:37] so remember that god wants us delivered
[1:55:56] we thank you for all things father
[1:55:59] forgive our sins and lead us
[1:56:01] by your grace
[1:56:02] in jesus name
[1:56:08] now i've had a cold
[1:56:10] so i don't wanna be afraid i'm gonna let
[1:56:12] weight break the bread
[1:56:15] but i know what the human that way
[1:56:17] sanctify and break
[1:56:19] family father we pray lord jesus take
[1:56:21] this bread my lord
[1:56:22] signifies your body
[1:56:24] lord it was broken for us lord account
[1:56:27] father we pray now that you just as we
[1:56:28] take it lord be a part of our body and
[1:56:31] lord just take it heal us and help us
[1:56:33] and make us well forgiveness of our sins
[1:56:35] bless us in jesus
[1:56:45] uh
[1:57:09] i just don't want to deal with hindering
[1:57:11] nobody
[1:57:18] father we thank you for this wine that's
[1:57:19] went through the process
[1:57:21] lord is to the place now that it gets
[1:57:23] better each day
[1:57:24] because it's the top of your
[1:57:26] blood
[1:57:27] that we shed for each and every one of
[1:57:29] us
[1:57:30] lord as we eat the little piece of bread
[1:57:32] and we drink the wine it becomes
[1:57:35] actually blood cells in our body and
[1:57:37] that way we can live by it lord
[1:57:39] if we ate enough of it and drank enough
[1:57:41] of the wine we could we could live
[1:57:44] but yet we just take this little portion
[1:57:46] as an example
[1:57:47] to see these things but you sanctify the
[1:57:50] wine and the partakers that we may all
[1:57:52] be one together in you in jesus name
[1:57:55] amen
[1:58:04] good morning
[1:58:07] i'll walk
[1:58:09] by the river
[1:58:12] i'll
[1:58:13] rest me
[1:58:15] the evergreen
[1:58:20] i'll
[1:58:21] carry
[1:58:23] my cross
[1:58:25] through the midnight
[1:58:28] good morning
[1:58:30] there's glory
[1:58:36] sometimes i'm
[1:58:38] despised
[1:58:40] and rejected
[1:58:43] and i question
[1:58:46] oh father
[1:58:51] then i take one
[1:58:54] more look
[1:58:56] at
[1:58:56] mount calvary
[1:58:59] and it gives me the strength to
[1:59:04] go on say them to him and think about it
[1:59:07] come on
[1:59:08] sometime between six and nine o'clock
[1:59:10] the prophet of god said
[1:59:14] that's the fourth watch of the night
[1:59:18] that's when jesus appeared on the water
[1:59:23] the prophet said there's only three
[1:59:25] watches in the night that's right
[1:59:26] because six and nine is in the morning
[1:59:30] it's called fourth watch of the night
[1:59:31] because it was still dark when sick
[1:59:33] starts
[1:59:36] for me
[1:59:38] come morning
[1:59:54] just think
[1:59:55] this is what we'll do at the marriage
[1:59:57] supper
[1:59:59] we'll take the communion
[2:00:03] be a wonderful time morning
[2:00:06] he said well how long would it take for
[2:00:08] the lord jesus to pass out bread for
[2:00:12] billions of trillions of born-again
[2:00:14] christians sitting down on the table
[2:00:17] i don't know i don't care
[2:00:19] because there's gonna be no time oh my
[2:00:22] god
[2:00:23] everything's gonna be present tense
[2:00:26] that's what i'm trying to get you to see
[2:00:29] there's a present tense gospel
[2:00:33] there's a believing that's real
[2:00:36] the day you receive the baptism of the
[2:00:38] holy ghost was rejoicing period right
[2:00:43] it was eternity for a split second there
[2:00:46] and then all at once the devil when he
[2:00:47] jumps on and says he didn't get it
[2:00:50] but what does that matter
[2:00:52] tell him he's alive
[2:00:57] my wife i didn't get it well if you
[2:00:59] didn't get it just keep believing until
[2:01:00] you get it just keep telling the devil
[2:01:02] he's a liar
[2:01:05] i don't wanna lie you're born one
[2:01:09] i don't solve nothing
[2:01:12] you're not making no great speech to me
[2:01:14] to say i don't want to lie
[2:01:17] the bible says by stripes i'm healed
[2:01:22] it doesn't say if i do this or do that
[2:01:24] it says buy stripes i'm healed
[2:01:28] why can't we believe it
[2:01:32] but why can't we believe
[2:01:34] that there'll be a change
[2:01:36] right right why can't we believe that
[2:01:40] because it will be
[2:01:42] why can't we believe that we're being
[2:01:44] changed that's right
[2:01:45] but i thought the bible said
[2:01:47] that we were being born again
[2:01:51] that's right
[2:01:52] sometimes a process has taken place
[2:01:56] why can't we believe it
[2:01:59] when are we going to start believing
[2:02:01] what god says instead of believing what
[2:02:02] the devil said
[2:02:08] you say i
[2:02:09] i'm healed i'm delivered
[2:02:14] and you'll go home a whole lot happier
[2:02:18] why is it when you get sick that you got
[2:02:20] expected to feel
[2:02:22] dirty and down and and got to lay around
[2:02:24] and say i don't know if you're good
[2:02:26] you'll get over it a whole lot quicker
[2:02:28] by getting
[2:02:30] up thursday i was
[2:02:34] coughing and so congested my wife knew
[2:02:36] it
[2:02:37] made me call the doctor to get something
[2:02:40] all right that's fine we believe in it
[2:02:44] but yesterday i was
[2:02:46] working out in the yard
[2:02:50] with the tractor
[2:02:53] i could have been laying up in the bed
[2:02:55] oh i feel so bad
[2:02:58] and you know what my wife would have
[2:02:59] waited on me
[2:03:03] but instead of that she was out there
[2:03:04] fussing at me
[2:03:07] there you're sick and out in the yard
[2:03:09] working
[2:03:12] cause i ain't gonna lay down
[2:03:16] you do it you won't get up
[2:03:18] forgive me let's take
[2:03:30] he said one of these days brother
[2:03:31] they'll hit you and you'll lay down well
[2:03:34] i'll be laying there saying buy stripes
[2:03:36] i'm healed that's right
[2:03:39] i miss
[2:03:40] going to work one day
[2:03:45] no go ahead
[2:03:47] my brother wants to testify
[2:03:50] come on up here don't
[2:03:57] you don't never know where to tell
[2:03:58] things from
[2:04:02] but uh
[2:04:04] you know i've been looking after her
[2:04:06] grandson
[2:04:08] who went over their house one day and
[2:04:09] then we brought him over to our house
[2:04:11] two days
[2:04:12] the last day we were over there
[2:04:16] and
[2:04:18] she and i'm not saying this to make
[2:04:19] nothing out of me or anybody else i'm
[2:04:21] just i'm just saying it happened
[2:04:25] and
[2:04:27] anyhow she said i'm gonna take daniel
[2:04:30] fever and they got this little thing
[2:04:32] that's sticking here you sing like at
[2:04:34] you
[2:04:35] she got back in the car and opened up
[2:04:37] she going around through the bag
[2:04:40] and she says
[2:04:42] i left that thing at home
[2:04:45] and the car and the thought went through
[2:04:47] my mind was
[2:04:48] now i got to go home and get that thing
[2:04:51] and take it all the way back over to
[2:04:53] nickelsville
[2:04:54] and the thought come to me brother
[2:04:56] brother said
[2:04:57] if my pocket knife
[2:05:00] was laying on the dress right
[2:05:02] he said and i just called for it in my
[2:05:05] pocket right
[2:05:06] all of this happened
[2:05:08] and then she said
[2:05:10] here it is
[2:05:14] and that
[2:05:15] that bothered me
[2:05:18] to whether or not it really happened
[2:05:23] then ain't nobody nowhere
[2:05:26] knows whether or not that happens or not
[2:05:29] because it happened
[2:05:31] and i believe
[2:05:33] i believe that's happening
[2:05:37] amen
[2:05:39] i believe
[2:05:43] well never happened to me never will
[2:05:47] you don't believe it
[2:05:49] wouldn't for you
[2:05:51] right
[2:05:52] wouldn't for you that's just easy i'm
[2:05:55] sorry
[2:05:57] but it's the truth
[2:05:59] when are we gonna
[2:06:00] believe are we going to say what god
[2:06:03] says
[2:06:06] and talk about what he does
[2:06:11] see we can stand here all afternoon and
[2:06:13] let the rest of you testify the things
[2:06:15] that god has done
[2:06:17] right
[2:06:21] but that's just
[2:06:24] you know
[2:06:25] i had that thirty or six that time go
[2:06:27] off within a barrel of less than six
[2:06:29] inches of my head and my head pointed
[2:06:31] towards the tree and the gun leaning
[2:06:34] against it and i was just that close to
[2:06:35] it
[2:06:36] and it went off and bark went come back
[2:06:38] into pieces and pieces of lead come back
[2:06:40] in my forehead
[2:06:42] and i didn't feel a thing
[2:06:45] i was actually hunting to see if i still
[2:06:47] together
[2:06:48] i had enough conscious in my mind
[2:06:51] i couldn't hear or couldn't feel and i
[2:06:53] got enough conscious in my mind if the
[2:06:55] top of my head was gone my hand would
[2:06:57] fall in
[2:06:59] and i was expecting it
[2:07:01] i rubbed across
[2:07:03] and i looked at it and there was blood
[2:07:04] little spots
[2:07:06] i said well that ain't gone let me see
[2:07:07] if i got the rest of it
[2:07:11] he said well what'd you do
[2:07:15] what was it going to do
[2:07:19] terence was over on a tree over there
[2:07:20] waiting one and she wanted to sound off
[2:07:23] today didn't even know that i'd
[2:07:25] been my gun
[2:07:27] what was it going to do
[2:07:29] well i'd been screaming and running to
[2:07:31] the doctor
[2:07:32] for what
[2:07:37] i went on up the tree and hunt
[2:07:40] i just didn't load my gun until i got up
[2:07:42] on the tree the next time
[2:07:45] and i've been more cautious of that
[2:07:48] and i try not to do it
[2:07:50] see
[2:07:52] we
[2:07:52] see
[2:07:54] why can't we believe that god is like i
[2:07:56] told you sitting up on that tree
[2:07:58] feels like my heart's hurting dying my
[2:08:00] arms aching all over just like a heart
[2:08:02] attack
[2:08:04] satan says i got you
[2:08:08] i said well lord
[2:08:10] i just eased back down to the old stands
[2:08:13] you know she had the hand hook to crawl
[2:08:14] up and
[2:08:15] i just slid back down and sit down kind
[2:08:17] of propped on the stand
[2:08:20] i said well lord if i go here i'm about
[2:08:23] 18 feet off the ground i don't have to
[2:08:25] feel that ground
[2:08:28] i don't have to worry about it i'm
[2:08:29] closer to you and i wouldn't be fight
[2:08:30] down there what does it matter to me
[2:08:32] what they find
[2:08:35] and i just sat down
[2:08:38] pain just started to ease it away
[2:08:41] i sat there an underdressed leg
[2:08:47] i'm just a scared brother that scared of
[2:08:49] what
[2:08:51] you must not be saved
[2:08:54] i ain't stupid i ain't walking out here
[2:08:56] from the train that come down the track
[2:08:59] nobody's talking about junk
[2:09:02] i'm just talking about what good would
[2:09:03] have done me that to run that day and
[2:09:05] jump down and by by hugging that tree
[2:09:08] i'd have probably had a heart attack
[2:09:10] because i had to belly hug it the old
[2:09:12] days were the stands we had i'd had the
[2:09:14] belly hugs and rashford to get down 18
[2:09:16] feet i'd have probably had one
[2:09:19] because i'd have been so nervous but
[2:09:21] instead of that i just said thank you
[2:09:23] lord
[2:09:24] you know
[2:09:27] what are you afraid of
[2:09:34] the ain't no devil in the world can get
[2:09:36] you to a goddess through with you
[2:09:39] do you think he could have stopped
[2:09:40] martin luther

[2:09:48] you can't stop this end time bride
[2:09:53] just say it let's walk into it
[2:10:01] you don't never say it you can't walk
[2:10:02] into
[2:10:09] let's get into the scriptures on the
[2:10:10] foot wash
[2:10:13] first john or john 13 verse 2
[2:10:16] the sufferer being the end of the devil
[2:10:17] having now put into the heart of judas
[2:10:19] it's carrick simon's son to betray him
[2:10:21] jesus knowing that the father had given
[2:10:23] all things into his hands that he come
[2:10:24] from god and went to god he risen from
[2:10:27] suffering laid aside his garments and
[2:10:28] took a towel and dirted himself after
[2:10:30] that he poured water into a base and
[2:10:32] began to wash the disciples feet and to
[2:10:34] wipe them with a towel where with he was
[2:10:36] girded then cometh he to simon peter and
[2:10:38] peter said unto him lord thus thou wast
[2:10:40] my feet jesus answered and said unto him
[2:10:43] what i do that i know it's not now but
[2:10:45] thou shalt know hereafter peter said
[2:10:47] unto him thou shalt never wash my feet
[2:10:49] jesus answered him if i was thee not
[2:10:51] thou has no part with me simon peter
[2:10:54] saith unto him lord not my feet only but
[2:10:56] also my hands and my head jesus said
[2:10:58] unto him he is worse than it is not
[2:11:01] saved to wash his feet but is clean ever
[2:11:03] wit and you are clean but not all for he
[2:11:06] knew who should betray him
[2:11:07] therefore said he you are not all clean
[2:11:10] so after he had washed their feet and
[2:11:12] had taken his garments and was set down
[2:11:14] again he said unto them know you what
[2:11:16] i've done to you you call me master and
[2:11:18] lord and you say well
[2:11:19] for so i am
[2:11:21] if i then your lord and master have
[2:11:23] washed your feet you also ought to wash
[2:11:26] one another's feet for i have given you
[2:11:27] an example that you should do as i have
[2:11:29] done to you verily verily i say unto you
[2:11:31] the servant is not greater than his lord
[2:11:34] neither he that is sent greater than he
[2:11:35] that sent him if you know these things
[2:11:39] happier ye
[2:11:40] if you do them
[2:11:42] let's just pray and let your sisters go
[2:11:44] downstairs for the foot washing we're
[2:11:46] praying the dismissal and all remember
[2:11:48] the services when steve white will be
[2:11:50] preaching wednesday so just remember
[2:11:52] that and just pray that the lord would

[2:12:03] is what you wanted to be brought and
[2:12:06] we've tried to do it with the right
[2:12:07] attitude lord and sometimes we get
[2:12:09] ourselves in the way and we're sorry
[2:12:12] but yet lord what we've said is true
[2:12:15] we believe that you're trying to do best
[2:12:16] to get us to step out on what we believe
[2:12:19] to confess what we believe to say that
