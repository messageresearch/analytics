be with us this morning Lord God and Quicken these words to us Lord Jesus we thank you Lord for your presence Lord God I'm so glad that we that Lord you're not still in the grave Lord but you're alive with us this morning Lord Jesus to prove that you're still the same yesterday today and forever that's what this message was was sent for we've got a quote where brother B said that I come to prove that Jesus is still the same today and we believe that this morning Lord that you're still the same you're still with us I pray God that you'll guide us through your words this morning and be with us this morning we pray amen thank you we want to turn this morning to Luke 18: [Music] 22 sure appreciate the presence of the Lord this morning and the worship amen it's it's good to have Liberty in the Lord in amen I want to I want to take a little topic this morning that you you can't stay here am pressing toward God's purpose amen you you can't stay here so let's read in uh this is the the story of the uh the Rich Young Ruler and we'll just read this one verse and then when Jesus had heard all these things that the little Rich Young Ruler had told him all the things that he had kept from his birth and all those things he said he he said unto him yet thou lackest one thing right seal all that thou Hast and distribute unto the poor and thou shall have treasure in heaven and come follow me God bless the reading of his word you can have your seats amen and I I I just uh I I began meditating on the on this kind of thought because um you know you hear sometimes preachers say a little line in in a sermon and they're just kind of kind of stick with you but I I think one of the one of the worst things that happens is happening in today in the this layout of spirit Creeps in and it gets a hold of people and they just begin to get comfortable with where they are right absolutely and you can see this really uh playing out in the story of the Rich Young Ruler he had maybe maybe he could be a type of of somebody living in this age that he was rich he had he was a ruler he had everything that he needed and he was fine just uh just stay in right where he was and and and of course Jesus laid out that challenge for him you know it really really what he's asking is where's where's your treasure what's the most valuable thing you got is it all all of that laid up uh in your barn and your all the property and things that you got or or are you willing to just uh forget all the uh wealth and everything you've got right and and and follow me amen and and really that this this kind of thought can apply to anybody that's here that's sitting here alive no matter where you are in your journey if you get comfortable with where you are then you're not doing what God you're not fulfilling God's purpose that we've got to continually press on towards God's purpose for so that it would be fulfilled in our life and you you even reminded of you know that story of Abraham where he was uh down there in that in the Fertile Crescent in the land of us and and God come and and spoke to him and told him to get it what a what a strange thing that it seemed like he'd have everything that he needed just situated real good and God told him get up and leave all of your uh families Idols all of that just get up and get going Y and there there in Hebrews 11: 13 it talks about all of those that uh that uh that died in faith not having received the promises but it says that they say they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country yeah in other words they were minded that I I ain't staying here you know you can look you can look around and see all of the things that are happening in the earth and and it seems like everybody kind of gets in a in a tizzy every time election season comes around everybody gets frightful and Afraid and and you you know the hurricanes come and disasters happen and we begin to wonder what's what's happening but you know really really it all comes down to this this this is not my home of course you know we know that that God's going to clean the world off and we're going to we're going to eventually after it's been purged and purified and going through the process that we're going to live here forever and ever but not not like this this world is not my home and brother Ram said in taking sides with Jesus he said now what my thoughts is if it could be possible that when I start going somewhere I don't know where I'm going but I can't sit still I ain't going to stay here here right come on that's right amen I just can't do it I got to move somewhere that's right now now see doesn't that play out exactly the same spirit that was in Abraham the same thing the same motives that were moving all of these old Saints of old that they got to go somewhere that's that's why as they were journeying through the Wilderness that there was the prophet said it looked like there was a wheel in the middle of the wheel cuz they were rolling on they can't they can't you can't sit still you got to keep going somewhere amen and he said I got to move somewhere and I probably won't stay there but a few days be moving somewhere else I got to go somewhere I don't know where I'm going neither did Abraham know where he was going he just crossed the river and started off and you know sometimes we're we're on the road it seems like we travel a lot lately but we you know we always joke well this is how this is how the spirit of an eagle an eagle's got to get to moveing that eagle that's why you find believers they got to go to youth camps they got to get up and they're going to do something because there there's something in them that longs for Revival and a Revival is not something to just get started a Revival is something that where you it refreshes what you already got and and it gets to kindling something and and what what is it it's something within you that's longing and seeking for a seeking for another country seeking for something that's not here so now when you look when you maybe maybe if you got a TV in your home or whatever your situation is if you're listening to the news and you see all of these all of the stuff going on about the election just remember this world is not my home now I I I I I I I really just want to frame up your mindset I think sometimes we we start looking at this candidate over here and this candidate over here and we think which candidate is going to save us now now come on now let's let's be real Christian about it which candidate is going to save us and and if I want to mind you let's take it back to what brother random said he said if I and and we all we almost laugh at this it seems like the reaction you get is people almost laugh when you make statements like this but he's the one that said if you put a George Washington and an Abraham Lincoln in every office all the way down to your local County government your Mayors all the way down this nation is still going down so there ain't going to be somebody to come set it up so you're going to be a real happy Christian and be real well situated and not going to have any problems it's not going to be set up like that I'm sorry to tell you on the one side and I'm not preaching politics but on the one side you're going to have uniting of church and state and the other other side you're going to have a woman Spirit ruling so whichever way it goes it's going to fulfill the plan and purpose of God that ain't up to me but I know one thing that this world is not my home and neither one of these candidates are going to make it so so that so that it's going to so that so that I'm going to want to stay here let's put it like that we see we see people they they you frame up even people they're looking for something so horrible that well I got to store up all these baked goods I got to store up all these things and we get to frame it up in our mind well I'm going to be here I'm going to be here and and I'm I'm almost to the point where it seems like people well I'm going to be here through the tribulation no no now when when the six seal opened up it revealed that the the foolish virgin and the 144,000 and all them have to go through those kind of rough times but now the bride is purified by the word so now we've already got everything that we need to be changed we and I ain't looking for nothing else but the secret calling and catching away for one day the bride is going to come come turned up missing and the rest of the church world is going to be what happened but but another words I'm not looking to store up all this stuff so that I can go through a tribulation period I'm not looking to store up all these things so I can plan out what's going to happen what I'm doing as I think brother brandom gave us a storehouse didn't he he stored up all of this food so you could have everything you need and you don't need a bunch of baked goods and things but what you need is a revealed word for the hour that you can anchor your soul to and anchor your whole journey and everything that's the thing that'll carry you across the river I'm not making plans to stay we can't stay you know whether are you not whether or not you believe in global warming or things like the Earth the Bible says that the Earth will burn with a fervent heat in other words that the Earth is getting to a place where you can't stay somebody we're going to have to get out of here and we and there's there's got to be something within our hearts that's laboring and pressing to get out of here and get out of here now you know we're talking about moving but I'm not really talking about moving naturally it seems like sometimes you you look at people the way that they live and they feel like they just got to hustle and bustle and go around every doing everything but you can be moving and sitting still now that's what I'm talking about you can go out and sit at the coast and you can see watch and the water will be evaporating and turning into clouds and raining maybe a thousand miles away and looks like nothing's happening and that's that's a different kind of moving than when you're hustling and bustling and trying to to work something up but that that's what I'm talking about this morning that that if God can if we can yield ourselves to God to where we're moving spiritually that you can't stay where you are spiritually I don't want to stay we got to move now what gets us to moving it it's the life that gets us to move you know even when you when you're out in the world you come to you get around church people and you start seeing something real I I've saw that work out in I've seen it in my own life I've seen it work out in my children's lives that time Zach was at the at one of the camp meetings and he was wondering is the message true or not is it real and he looked up on the prayer line and and there was a pillar of fire actually there like I'm I'm talking about not something you could just look at on the picture but the pillar of fire there in the camp meeting what what was it it's a life the life and you see brother brother Ram would say that's why the devil gets so upset when people begin to receive their healing and signs and wonders begin to happen in the meeting CU it's the life actually demonstrating vindicating that the word is not something that we're just learning about it but it's something real and you get you get sit on on the old rock and chair porch with with an old timer and where you can actually listen to the real life Echo forth from their lips and tell you about their experience and then something begins to draw you because that's what happens to maybe an unbeliever they get around a Believer and and and the life is what you begin to see it's the attraction on the mount God's word is being fulfilled in that person's life and it begins to attract you it begins to draw you it's not just it's not just a desire to to learn things so that we can hold it in front of somebody else and say well look how much I know but it's the life oh it goes it all goes back to that like John in the Book of Revelation he saw one set on the throne and round about that one on the throne was a rainbow that went around and it was green why Emerald why cuz it symbolized life the whole story is about life brother said why did it have to be Shepherds cuz Shepherds know about life life when when the when the bride tree was eaten down it was eaten down all the way down to the roots but there's life in the root what kind of Life have predestinated seed germ life that's going to come up and and it's life life is the thing that drives the church that's the spirit that quickeneth life and and this is a living gospel not something that's dead not something that's buried in the ground up there in Jeffersonville or something but it's a living gospel and what's this gets us to move is the Life of Christ that actually is actually drawing us now now the thing though if you want to if you want to get to the life there here's the thing if you want to get to the life then you got to get you got to come through the word am you got to come through the word amen you know one of the one one of the most compelling reasons to move is the Life of Christ amen what's the life I want to be changed you you start coming it's like coming into the outer Court you come to the outer Court I I see them offering their sacrifice I see the blood driven down from that lamb I want and you begin to realize I I want to be changed I want to get into that into that holy of holies I want my guilt to be taken away I I want to be free I want to be righteous and that's what the life does it the life begins to work on you and it begins to change you to be like Jesus it's the Life of Christ that's what like like brother Michael was saying this morning it's not the message is not a bunch of rules a bunch of things that we've got to follow a a list of doctrines but it's actually the Life of Christ living himself out in you to make your life match up with the word and it's God's life fulfilling his word in you now in the queen of the South brother Brown was say he said if you went to a pumpkin vine you'd expect to find pumpkins if you went to a watermelon vine you'd expect to find watermelons you went to a grape vine you'd go to grapes and if you come to the church you don't expect Theology and arguing and fussing y right what you expect to see you expect to see the Life of Christ the vine moving in the branches amen bringing forth The Same Spirit yes that lived in the Lord Jesus absolutely amen for he lives amen he's alive today if he is he will do the same Works Jesus said if I do not the works of my father that sent me then believe me not amen I think that again Echoes what brother Michael was speaking on this morning that if you got faith it's going to manifest oh and we know all we know the pattern we've been taught that faith is Faith is something inward that only really only God can see it's something between you and God me your works is for others why is it for others because it's an attraction it's your salt it's the salty Savor that makes somebody else thirsty that makes somebody else want it they're they're not looking at or your mean attitude or whatever but they're looking at the Life of Christ The Life of Christ is what draws calls them and the message conferences he said we could scream and shout and do whatever we want to it'll never influence man until they see the Life of Christ being projected in you someone who's I I I like reading these things because he lays out kind of what I I almost like the measuring stick of what we're trying to trying to get at someone who's tender and merciful and forgiving you know to get to a place where you're tender sometime it's like meat sometimes you have to be wonked a little bit through life to get to get tenderized a little bit you got to go through some experiences and challenges in life some you lose some things that are valuable one and and go through some rough some rough battles get tenderized to a place where you can really he said and ready to turn the other side of the cheek or give the second coat or go the Second Mile Christianity and action not just taught from the pulpit but acted among the members among the pastors that's when you see Christ Living in this church decisions but but if you want if you want that life you got to come by the word it's the life that attracts us I I sure remember when I was a young man growing up and I I'd look at different Believers and I think my I'd see their reaction to situations just real genuine Believers that I held in high regard and I'd see their the way that they reacted to things and i' my there's no way that you could be patient like that except it would be God working in you there's no way that you you could react and it begins to it all you get around somebody like that and it'll begin to convict you you begin to get around the real life well that's that's actually why people in the world you go to Walmart and it seems like they hate you because you sisters because you're wearing a dress because the life is on display the life gets it begins to confront your your sinful nature and the way that you are and you begin to you get pricked and you're like I but but to get that life to get that Deliverance that you you'' got to come by the word because the word what is the word the word is actually maybe it's it's like maybe this would be a carnal illustration but if you could take the spirit and dehydrate it put it into a form another form and read it on the page there's it's the word it's the spirit in letter form and then you Quicken it and you rehydrate it again and it's just the spirit so the word actually is the spirit it's the the word is when you're reading the word it is the spirit all you got to do is believe it and then it will produce what it will Express the God's thought it will Express the spirit in your life and that's why Jesus would say in Matthew 4:4 he said he answered it is it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God that word is what we're living by because the word actually will produce the life of God in you and John 6:63 he said it's the spirit that quickeneth the flesh Pro of nothing my the carnal outside that you see the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life the word that falls into the good ground of your heart actually produces the life and brother R would say this he said and I I think this is the foreal he said the word itself is spirit it's spirit in word form and then you see when it is quickened or brought to life the spirit of the word goes to work and acts absolutely so the point I'm trying to make here is we're trying what are we pressing forward we're pressing toward the life actually lived out in us and we've got to no matter where you are you're pressing forward and you're you you can't stay where you're at if you're in a state of justification this morning you can't stay there if you're in a state of sanctification this morning you can't stay there and if you're in if you're born again you can't stay there you got to keep moving you got to keep pressing on don't ever get satisfied with where you are amen amen and and and you know uh you know sometimes when when you go out preaching and things you'll hear people Express express what they believe and little quick statements and things right and one of the things you know I've heard people say I as long as we can get somebody to the baptismal pool we've got them to Salvation now what now let's think about these things this morning cuz I you know teaching really places and it helps us to understand where we're at and whatnot sure you get somebody to believe in in Jesus Christ Christ and and they're they're they're they're at a spot yeah where they're saved amen but then IR like irenius he compared baptism baptism to uh to justification if we can and you you'll see so so many people come to a state of justification just like they come to the baptismal pool and they come and they they start off real good and they're they're they're real excited about it and but then they don't they don't linger they don't wait until but they don't hang on to the word and then they go right back out from right back out into the world right back out into the condition so that that my point this morning is I'm not satisfied getting somebody just to a place of conception it's just it works just like a natural birth there's different stages first there's a conception and then the little muscles begin to Twitch and there's a form of life down in that b in that mother's womb and there's a a form of life working and moving but the baby ain't there yet life doesn't come until you're born and you can't hold that baby in your arms until it's born there there might be a miscarriage and so we don't want we don't want spiritual miscarriages we don't want to get somebody to the baptismal pool and then Wonder like sometimes happens in the natural what happened you know brother I'm I'm I'm steered away from something like we want we don't want to get somebody to just to a conception but we want to get them to a birth amen and and brother will say in the second coming of the Lord he said listen you're not saved until you're born again that's right you just turned your face toward something now that's what justification it's like coming into the outer court and there's the Altar and there's the labor the labor where you can come and get baptized the altar where your sacrifice is and you're believing well the sacrifice is going to make me righteous because I'm looking at the sacrifice I'm looking at the shed blood but you're not in the holy of holies yet you're not saved until you're born again you just turn your face toward it you just turn your face toward something but when you accept Christ you're born again in 1 Corinthians 12:3 it says wherefore I give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of God calleth Jesus a cursed and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost now many people say he's the Lord but you can't actually say it by Revelation until you've gone into the holy of holies you can't say he's Lord of your life that you can't say that he's living on the throne of your heart until you're born again so he said he said you're complete in Christ and you're not saved because that you pack a crucifix now that's a good Justified person maybe you you got a crucifix in your car and and you're saying well this is it I I've come I've I've been baptized and this is it no you are just getting started you're not saved because you go to church you're not saved because you know your catechism or your textbook you're not even saved because you know the Bible you you are saved because you know the person Jesus Christ and what does he say to know him is life now there's the thing we're getting to is life life when the when deity is expressed in your members and you're not just you're just not memorizing things and going through an act and trying to make something work but Christ is actually living in you not even to know his word is life but to know him the person is life there's only one way to know him that's to be born again of the spirit of God Amen something begins to work at justification oh yeah amen but but you're not born again yet you still got the same habits amen right brother amen you still got the same see that as those those habits are the things I'm I'm trying to get away from those habits are those things I remember years ago that you you don't have you'd have when I was coming to the Lord you'd have these bad habits you're like well how can I get rid of these things how I I I want to get rid of these thoughts in my mind I want to get rid of all the the my incl it's your inclination to do wrong how can I get rid of that so that there's something in me that magnetizes me to the word and magnetizes me to the right instead of magnetizes me to the wrong there you got to have something on the inside that changes you so that you're not leaning toward the wrong but you're leaning toward the right and then even if you mess up even if you fall down in the mud you get back up again cuz you're leaning to the right you want to be right that's what the Holy Ghost life inside of a believer does and and an unbeliever you or a person still in a state of justification they got the same habits the same old thoughts the same old desires the old man is still there that unclean spirit is happily living in your soul what's the unan spirit it's that thing that gives you that inclination it's leaning you toward the wrong now listen I know we've got people sitting here this morning in different stages of their journey and if you're at a stage of maybe a a more stage of maturity or something where maybe you feel that this doesn't quite apply to you draw don't draw up on me but pull on it because you want somebody else to get a blessing don't go to sleep on me because you don't think it applies to you or your situation don't don't draw up on me because maybe you've heard it so much before but this is a time for you to pull and say preach it brother because if I've already got it somebody else can get it too in John 3:5 he said Jesus answered verily very this is what Jesus telling Nicodemus verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit the washing of the water of the word the word and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God in other words he's saying you might be living a good clean life you might be good living a good Pharisee life you might know all about the scriptures because you've been going to synagogue and you've been taught and everything but that ain't good enough you got to be born of water and of the spirit in other words there is no sh at justification there's no shity at sanctification you got to be born of the water in the spirit you might have a measure of life in your spiritual journey you might have like a a little baby beating the muscles twitching in this Mother's Mo womb but you don't have life yet life has not come into you I I was sharing this little video with Esther of this doctor that this little baby was born and the little baby was uh laying there and that doctor was just so calm that baby was born still born and he would just got to working on that baby and he had just work for minutes and minutes and that baby wasn't breathing but all of a sudden what he was doing began to take effect he you know massaged the muscles and and he he knew how to do it and all of a sudden that little baby took a break of Life Breath of Life now that same thing will happen to you in the Supernatural in the natural that happens when you you take that breath of natural life and and the life enters into you but there's something else has got to happen to bring you to a state that what it brings you back to what we lost in the Garden of Eden that eternal life brings you back to where we we we come where we're supposed to be at it brings you back to the place where God where because of our Disobedience and because of our sin we were severed from relationship and fellowship with God and restores us back to that and there'll come a time in your Supernatural Journey when you'll take a breath just like that and it's it let me PE people try to explain way something happening when you're born again but something Supernatural happens in the same way that something happens when that natural baby takes a breath of life and life comes in now now this is what I'm getting to you might not run or shout you might not leap about you might not do many things but I tell you what you will believe God's word and your life will begin to change you will begin to be regenerated because the express you are the express of the attributes of God and the same characteristics that were in Jesus Christ are expressed in you and you might not always run around and Shout like everybody does and you might not do all the things that maybe the religious world says that you should do but nevertheless you are an expression of deity God living in you and that's why you can't stop at justification you got to keep going on don't be satisfied with a state of sanctification you got to keep going on never be satisfied you got you do you realize that's what the fivefold ministry is to do is to continually push and encourage you don't stay where you are don't get to a place where you think this is good enough you got to keep pressing on he said and you must be born again he said no matter how much that we think we try to think we are right and saying a Creed or joining a church you're still what you were right until you're actually born again of the spirit of God hallelujah amen you're still what you were until you actually born again in the spirit of God Amen saying a Creed joining a church I you well we're not a denomination we can't just say a Creed and join a church come on now my friends he said it doesn't change you right your Creed joining church or changing your ideas or your good intentions look look let's really examine this changing your ideas that's not good enough no good intentions that's not good enough although as good as it might seem it's still not right there's something got to happen amen the new birth is an experience something that takes place amen and we've always heard the you know pre Preachers preached on it for years that when when you're born again it naturally birth you know when that baby starts crying and the spiritual birth the baby's going to come forth crying out ABA father it's going to come forth with a desire for his daddy amen what what kind of experience are we talking about a personal encounter with Christ where you've read about it and you you learned about it but then now then you meet him you meet him it's a revelatory experience that transforms you deep within because Christ has become personally known you know him it's not it's not that you're just reading about it but now you know him I tell you what when you know him then you can fall in love with him when you begin to know him in those dark moments you praying beside your bed at night like David tossed around to deep call to the deep as what he would say then you begin to know him it's not just something that you've heard about but you know him it is a deep internal change a complete shift of your nature now now reg the the new birth let's not get this wrong the new birth is a start of your regeneration you're going to begin to grow in a stature of a perfect man but I tell you what when you're born again it starts something it's going to start a change something begins to change and it makes you different deep internal change a complete shift of nature desires and your thinking you know you're not Desiring the things of the world but what you want is you want more of God because you know the way to the life is the is through the word if you're going to get more life you got to come to the word you tell me a born again Christian don't want some some more word you tell me a born again Christian don't want to be in the house of God there something that changes when you're born again and you want more of the word because it brings you to the life not just a change in Behavior but a transformation of identity amen right there might be physical and emotional reactions there probably are going to be little spots and spits and Spurs here and there crying in the shower crying in the car praising God on the way to work something's going to happen when when life comes in and I don't believe in a go cold dead formal religion where you just come to church and sit on the Pew and say well I got it I believe that when life comes something begins to happen something begins to transform your being it's the death of the old self and when your old self begins to die out you tell me that something can happen with with when you're dying you got to die to your old self before you can be born again the old has got to die you're moving away from all those worldly desires and sins and when you're filled with the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost will Empower you to be to live a Christian Life of service right it empowers you to live a life for others amen and brother R will say a new birth can be without sensation why because he's saying that the new birth does not necessarily rely on outward signs and Sensations and emotions when you're born again you might not necessarily see all of those things that the religious World typically likes to label you know the Pentecostals used to wonder well they used to say well if unless you speak in tongues unless you do this we're always trying to find a thing that we can label unless you do this thing unless you cry unless You Weep unless you shout unless you run the a but he's saying the new birth will be without sensation you might see all those different things but what you will see is a faith and a regenerated life amen faith and a regenerated life in Christ are at the core of the new birth amen even if you don't see emotional displays it's about being filled with God's spirit and transformed in obedience to his word which might not always come with outward actions or immediate signs that other people can look at and it all starts with justification MH right justification starts when a man realizes he is justly under God's condemnation and wrath and there might be some of you sitting here this morning that are realizing God's got a right to judge me to send me to hell right God's got a right to send me to hell now that's when justification actually starts something begins to click and you begin to realize I I ain't the way that I should and if I were to die right now I would not go to heaven y I would not I something needs to take place and what what begins to take place is when that really begins to click you become consumed with a desire to return to God's Divine favor you realize that if God would have judge you right now that you would go if if the floor were to open up you'd go right down to Hell and and there wouldn't be nothing to stop that and I tell you what that that'll get the wheels turning you begin consumed like like David crying out on his bed the Deep calleth unto the Deep at the noise of thy water sprouts what is it is something within you crying out there's something wrong with me there's something wrong and it can only be satisfied by the sacrifice of a holy God a holy God making an atonement for me amen you know and and Jesus said I think that's why he said in Matthew Chapter 5 blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they should be filled if you just got a hunger down in your soul to be made right then there's a promise that God will fill you that he will feel that appetite and in John chapter 6 he said Jesus answer answered them and said unto them murmur not among yourselves no man can come to me except the Father which has sent me draw him and I will raise him up at the last day it is written in the prophets and they shall be all taught of God how does God draw us he draws Us by demonstrating his power and his life so that we can see that life and then he begins to preach the word to bring us into condemnation and it's is actually God this morning drawing at you and pulling at you pulling you into that holy of holies to draw you and to compel you to come in F the hedges and the byways to come in and to not stay where you are there's a promise in Ezekiel 36 of justification that God can take that heart that Stony heart and begin to soften it up he said a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit I'll take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you an heart of Flesh and that's what justification begins to do to to a to to to just a little worldly person it begins to soften up their heart to where God can and brother Ram compared it like like like a apple that gets all bruised up over time it gets bruised and becomes mellow so mellow that a little baby could sit down and eat it now this morning aren't you glad that God's working on us that he don't lead us leave us all Hard Hearted sitting out there in the world coming home from work drinking your alcohol and going to sleep getting up the next morning with a hangover and think this is all there is to life but you come and get around Believers or somebody begins to testify to you at work and you begin to realize that there's a purpose in your life that you ain't supposed to go through life like that that there's a purpose and a calling for your life and it begins to soften up your heart and God begins to draw you soften up your heart it's like a little bruised Apple the little baby could eat a baby don't that doesn't have teeth could just so soft and tender now that's that's somebody dealing with somebody in justification what does a justifi Justified person look like it looks like somebody that puts their faith in the sacrifice of Jesus Christ that's job on his Ash sheep he had confidence in those ashes of the ashes of his sacrifice no matter what came in his life he was going to he he wasn't looking at what he had done but he was looking at his sacrifice and a Justified person will turn around it's going to have a strong desire to repent and live differently a Justified person is going to start Desiring to come to church and what does a Justified person do they've had their guilt of sin removed offering peace with God Amen although the person is yet not yet fully Sanctified they can now approach god without the burden of guilt that once weighed them down what does justification do it's legal and we're talking about life this morning justification don't have nothing to do with your character that's right that's why you can't stay at justification you go into the courtroom and because you're Justified the the judge can't swing as gavel and send you to the prison cuz you've been Justified and Justified is more than just a a pardon of all of your sins but it's actually it affects how God looks at you it's how God looks at you that you are righteous in God's sight because he's paid the price for you oh this morning aren't you glad that you've got a lamb that's over there in Revelation when when we preach on that we've got a lamb to make us worthy to read the seals and it wasn't by our own doing it wasn't by our own works but we've got a lamb they had a lamb in the Garden of Eden to pay the price God come down and killed a lamb and the whole scripture testifies that God would come down a holy God that required that a god of Integrity that required Justice that satisfied Justice through a lamb that he offered on the on the cross what is it justification changes your legal status but not your character that's right justification is an acquittal from guilt y as though your innocence has been proven y right it was as though somebody come running in there and said he's not he's actually not guilty because God looks not at you but at your sacrifice at what Jesus did for you on the cross justification is solely an objective change in your standing in relation to the law and it's immediate it's an immediate legal Declaration of righteousness it don't take long workup but you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you are Justified amen it's the opposite of to condemn it is a legal change from a state of guilt and condemnation to a state of forgiveness and acceptance but it has nothing to do with your nature that's right it has nothing to do with your character amen it only has to do with the way that God is looking to you from a legal perspective legal righteousness is not a habit infused into your heart but a gift transferred to your account it's not a habit transferred into your in your heart and that's why you got to come to it but you can't stay you can't stay at justification it it's what we're talking about is where is your anchor hooked on if you're at justification your anchor is not clipped on to the Rock of Ages yet it's not clipped on to something and that's why so many people their ship drifts back out into the world after a while because they're trying to live by their little faith they puny little faith they're they're looking to the Cross oh but when God gives you his faith that's an anchor that will hold you forever the anchor of his faith at the new birth will anchor you to the Rock of Ages justification is perfect for deathbed confessions it's it's great for that that that last little moment where you say well I you confess your sin there and a soldier on the battlefield that's been shot in the stomach and just there in that moment he begins to confess all his wrongs and say I'm looking to Jesus Christ and and and they're just like the thief on the cross this day you'll be with me in Paradise oh what a great but see in this hour in this hour where that we're living in you got to keep mve this treacherous hour where there's there's foolish foolish virgins and and and fakes and and and all these things you got to keep moving you can't stay at a con stage state of conception and questions and answers La law having a Shad brother Ram said you're born again when you receive the Holy Ghost that's when you're converted you might be in process of conversion but you're not converted until it's completed amen and you're sealed into the kingdom of God plenty of Fallen away from justification plenty of turned around and then turned back turned back around plenty of started and and stayed put but we can't stay where we are no and the basis of Fellowship he said I want to ask you something if justification is all God requires I'd like to ask you this when the man was separated By the Waters of Separation sprinkled then he could not yet enter into the worship of the glory of the Lord he could not do it because he was only sprinkled from his sin right it separated from his sins but did not put him in Fellowship that's right it only separated from his sins now Ephesians said we are Washed by the Water of the word now hearing the word and being just as religious as you want to be and your pastor a scholar and your doctor of divinity a scholar still that don't put us in Fellowship no sir it will not do it now I got 10 more minutes so I'm going to try to Leap Frog let's let's see it's like it's like the children of Israel going through the Wilderness of the Wilderness of sin when they when they come across that uh across the Red Sea it they were in a state of justification look back and see all of your sins passed away and Mariam got her tambourine and she began to dance and praise God all those things that used to plague me all that all my past is going away but what if they had have stopped there they they had eaten the lamb they had the blood over the lentil of their door but what if they had stopped and not keep going on they would would never have reached that promised land they were in a place like real justification let makes you look back and you can say well what sin you can really have have have a h h have true confidence that come to God and all of your sin has been washed away when the Devil comes with all his accusations what sin are you talking about but you got got to keep going on because your character has not been changed and a hidden life in Christ brother R said there's many people today that's never went any farther than the outer Court the veil yet they are Christians they by the millions they enjoy Christ in an outward form coming to church Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ in a Justified State they go to church with a consolation of knowing they belong belong to church but they have never become hid away with him in the inner court but out there they eat Mana see it matters it matters where you're eating you can eat the same word in the outer court and it won't have the same impact that it does in the in in the holy of holies that's right you can be sitting here in the same word but it matters where you are when you eat it amen you eat it and the holy place and it'll have a different impact than it does in the outer Court sir but it still won't have the same impact that it would if you're in the holy of holies right you got to go on to where the Mana keeps where it keeps and it doesn't grow stale and it doesn't have to keep being replenished we have to keep relighting the candlesticks and and massaging your experience going to a little Revival meeting to have a quick pickme up but you go on into the holy of holies and the Mana will keep justification is a change of legal state status but sanctification begins to produce a moral transformation of character and this is that little spot that is so dangerous and this is really the Crux of what I'm getting at that you can't stay you you sure can't stay at just you can't stay at justification but you definitely can't stay at sanctification sanctification is that spot that you got to go but you can't stay there you can't stay there what salv sanctification salvation from sin requires both a clearing justification and a cleansing amen and why are you being cleaned up M cuz the whole house is getting swept and and cleaned out because the king is coming you got to get everything PR prepared before the king can come first you got to get your name cleared first you got to be justified you got to have your name cleared and then then let's get this place cleaned up so you have a good a good moral life you're trying to do things you're trying to trying to clean things up because God is Not going to come in a filthy place and something's moving at at sanctification something's moving but it ain't yet alive right now that's that that's that whole debate about abortion in the world it's moving it's moving in Mama's womb but it's not yet alive it hadn't toen that taken that breath yet it's moving it's alive but it's not yet alive it's not that life that we're getting to now that's the same thing in the spiritual birth it's moving but it ain't alive yet am in sanctification something is actually imparted to us but in justification it is only imputed sanctification imparts a love for God a capacity to worship Him acceptably and a meekness for heaven justification is by a righteousness without us sanctification is by a Holiness wrought in US justification removes the obligation to punishment and sanctification cleanses you from pollution amen cuz you got to be made holy for the king aren't you glad that the king wants to come and sit down on the throne of your heart come down and make your heart his seat his Mercy Seat where he can set himself down and begin to transform you from the inside but before he can come you got to be cleaned out you got to be and what does the clean and it's the word it's the word that made you want to be justified it's the word that began to mold your life in a state of sanctification it's the word that made you want to be a Christian it's the word that made you want to worship and of sanctification because God is cleaning up the place so that he can come and take his Abode in you you got to get rid of that unclean Spirit though in the power of God brother R said there was a young lady came out of a store that was immorally dressed little bitty old clothes like you wear here and everywhere else you know just indecently he said what makes somebody what makes the world dress the way that do they do what makes people act in the way it's an unclean Spirit right it's a spirit Spirit a little devil down in their heart that's making them act the way that they do and he said the unclean Spirit what does it do he goes over and gets into this person and begins to tell him this and you know what he does it's just like what Jesus said you can pass the Seas to make one price of light and what easy when you get through with him he's talking about that unclean Spirit goes out comes and returns back with all of his buddies and now you got just a a more two-fold child of hell than he is to start with but now let's meditate on that this morning don't get tired on me hold on just a minute goad you got an unclean Spirit when you're when you're out in the world sir and you ain't living for God there is a spirit in your brother will say there's a spirit that keeps you from responding to the word and that Spirit when you come into a real Holy Ghost filled meeting you come up for prayer and a and a real Holy Ghost anointed preacher can lay hands on you and we're we're called to cast that Spirit out and then when that spirit is cast out then you can really begin to respond the way that God always wanted you to you can respond and you can begin to believe and you can be you can come and sit in church in a real Sanctified condition yes sir Sanctified because that Spirit has been cleaned out but the danger of sanctification sir is that you start off in a good clean moral condition but if you stay there too long yes sir come on the danger is that unclean spirit will go out and get all his buddies and bring them back and find the place all nice and clean it's been cleaned out for the king but you stopped you stopped and you stayed where you were you because you thought that you had the new birth you stopped you were going to church and you were worshiping you were crying in church and all those things and you stopped and what the devil does he'll go and he he'll leave you in a nice clean moral State oh yeah but what he'll do is he'll bring all of his buddies back and he'll make you worse and you become like a like a horrible old Pharisee right and that's why brother Brandon would preach those sermons about the meanest man I know that Pharisee sitting there mocking Jesus over in the corner he was a religious person a religious hypocrite you couldn't put one finger on his life and that's why you know the the longer I live as a Christian the less I care about all the dos and don'ts it's about your character it's about your life we come and we we try to compare things that we're doing and what everybody else is doing but that that's what a old Pharisee will do I don't want to be like that Pharisee sitting over there you caused the blind man to be healed on the Sabbath you went down to the bull of Bethesda and you raised him up on the Sabbath day and and all the you all these accusation we we we pay ties of all these things but we yeah we don't pay ties of mint and cumin but we're doing all these other things that we're supposed to be doing and it that mean those mean what is it pride and enity and jealousy and all those things sat down in your heart and you begin to look with a crooked finger at other people and say well I'm doing things that you're not and it turns you into that now that's that's a worst state that's what the first seal is about a genuine Holy Ghost filled believer and a fake that go reding out and how you to tell the difference in until you come to a place of maturity and you can look and see well there goes there's the lion and there's the white horse rider a faker that's sitting there in the house of God and faking all this time all these years and as fake as anything fake brother would say that white white horse rider is what it is it's a it's a foolish virgin that sits and acts like a real believer but the whole time it's just feel it's a house of Devils whitewashed on the outside but all of those Devils have come and incarnated thems in that person and made them made them what a mean person amen Matthew 12: 43 he said when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through Dry places seeketh rest and findeth none right then he saith I will return unto my house from whence I came out and when he has come he findeth it empty swept and garnished then go goeth he and taketh with himself seven other Spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man is worse than the first now if you could just picture in your mind if you could look at my notes I've got a picture here of this spook going out of a house the unclean Spirit leaves out of the house but if you stop and you don't keep going on here comes that spook back with seven of his friends m what is mere moral Improvement without true spiritual transformation am can leave a person vulnerable to worse demonic influence cuz why you got to get the you got to get Faith there to stand at the door and keep that devil out because if if faith if the Holy Ghost is not in your house that it's been prepared for then the devil will bring all of his buddies back and you will still be in a state of moral a good moral Christian and you'll be sitting there like like I'll use this as an example Ron Spencer with all he's going through all this cancer trouble and yet preaching the gospel and and suffering through it an example of faith and S people will sit there writing their letters the reason you got cancer is because you ain't living for the Lord or because you got secret sin or whatever that is it's it's meanness and mean mean that's why all these times that brother Ram would hammer on how that the devil l loves church just as much as you do the devil will come and sit down and make a a lot of critical that critical spirit criticizing the movement of the Holy Ghost criticizing a good Holy Ghost camp meeting criticizing the real baptism of the Holy Ghost Pride imity a bunch of jealous preachers pointing fingers at one another and it's actually it's what is it the same battle that's been going on from the Garden of Eden Cain and Abel Jacob and Esau Judas and Jesus all the way down God camped out in his church and the devil camped out right there with him right alongside of him what is it Pharisees I'm I'm going to keep going just a little bit longer Pharisees seated themselves in positions of authority this is what the Pharisee does all their deeds were done for show seeking praise greetings in Marcus and the title Rabbi they they wanted that title Rabbi and you'll see the the mark of the devil the devil always wants he's got these characteristics he always wants power he wants praise and he wants recognition the devil ain't going to take the backseat he wants people to be telling him how good he's do it and telling him this and setting him up on a pedestal because that's the characteristics of the devil and you watch it compare that the characteristics of Christ is he's fine with a Manger he's fine he's fine with a little manger but the devil got to have the first place that was what started out in the in in heaven the devil come out and he wanted all the angels to come to him because he wanted to usurp Authority he wanted to be the big shot and that same characteristics oh brother that's why brother R would say God is always identified by his characteristics because when you look at a real Born Again cre Christian you can see the same characteristics of Christ in that person and the same way you can see the devil moving and and and working in the church he said that's right the devil loves to come to church amen you can't stay where you're at if you remain in a state of sanctification you become susceptible to self-righteousness always seeking honor and titles and status while neglecting real sincerity and Faith amen if you stay in a state of sanctification too long you become susceptible to a neglect of inner Purity you're focusing on all these outward things let's make sure the outside is is painted white the outside looks real good but inside you're lacking real inner Holiness and commitment to God brother outside outside you're you're always placing judgment on others while you're failing to examine your own sins and your own faults all the you look at all there's a reason why all these things that the FES were laid out plainly for us in scripture you healed a blind man on the Sabbath day you didn't wash your hands you didn't wash your hand you refused they refused to enter Pilot's residence to avoid ritual defilement while they were putting a man to death this hypocrisy despite witnessing all these Miracles they continue to demand signs from Jesus as proof of his authority worse than being clean is being clean and mean yeah right amen and if you stay in sanctification you are susceptible to being clean and brother R would say there is Devils but Jesus cast them out and he gave his church authority to do so cast out devils in my name he cast Seven Devils out of a pretty woman one day and he said when the unclean Spirit has gone out of a man he walks in dry places returning back then bringing seven other Devils with him now that goes to show that if the man was cleaned of devils there was something in him had gone out yes right a devil had gone out now when the devil moved out God gives an opportunity to move in amen right and when he goes out let the Holy Spirit come in amen it it's all he's he's operated by our will right right we sit there and we're like well I'm fine and listen I've I've observed a minister can't help but observe you go through life and you look and you you just see you you can't stay you you can't stay where you are we can't stay on this Earth I got to get out of here you can't stay at justification you got to keep moving on you sure can't stay at sanctification because sanctification just opens up your whole psyche to all of this danger amen when he goes out let the holy spirit in don't just leave it there yes if you do just repent of your sins and go on then you're going to be worse off than ever but get that place where Satan once lived and occupied get it filled with the holy spirit of God and then you'll have the strength of God's word in you manifest it and cast out Devils C contest is on the evening lights are shining God's holy spirit is present how how do you get born again first you got to want it like those people out there on the day of Pentecost men and Brethren what what are we supposed to do you and and what makes you want it is you see the life if you heard the word preached to bring you to a state of condition and you begin to look at Jesus Christ not at you begin to look at his life and what he did for you and not not anybody else and not your own works and then you begin to press in and that's what I'm encouraging you this morning to press in never stop pressing in I remember my own spiritual battle I would pray through the night I would I would lay there until 2 or 3:00 in the morning because I wanted something from God and listen you don't have to pray it's not that we're laying out all these instructions you all you got to do is believe but there's something going to be in you something pulling you and drawing you that you'll press in you'll take the kingdom by force according to what the Bible said the Bible says you got to take the kingdom of Force if you want it like John took the little book then come on and take it if you want it you might as well take it why don't we stand to our feet as the musicians come there's a promise here laying for you and it's a promise of not just to act like a Christian but to be the real expression of deity what is the real Holy Ghost Field believer going to be like they're going to be the expression of every attri every characteristic of God expressing himself in your life expressing himself in the way that you talk and the way that you think and the way that you move in the way that you function to believe God's word and to regenerate your life that's what I'm looking for this morning is for the life you got to keep moving you can't stay in the same place amen you can't stay it's a life this morning as the musicians play thank you everything that brother Brown taught us was about the life David said that he'll be like a tree planted by the rivers of water why you got to be planed you can't be stuck out like in a greenhouse maybe in justification you're like in a little pot still being moved about but when you're born again you are planted by the rivers of water and you get your nourishment from that water you ain't going to fall away if you're born again we sing that song something keeps holding me it's not that you're you're holding on but it's Christ is holding on to you cuz your roots have been planted way down in the earth and are soaking up the moisture from that River of Life it's a River of Life That's flowing through [Music] us it's the River of Life I wonder if we if we'll turn our heads to the Earth if we'll just bow our heads this morning maybe there'll be somebody here this morning that felt that pricked in their heart by the word that was preached maybe you're realizing that you've been staying too long where you were at you've been staying too long now that could really go for all of us yes amen won't you just respond in the way that God is calling you to yes Lord if you've been staying too long it's time to put that foot out and get the [Music] walking maybe it's time to drop those knees to the floor and get to praying and get to pressing yeah don't get to stay in we got to keep moving on yeah oh God you see every hand raised this morning Lord Jesus my hands raised up right with them Lord God something within my heart is Echo and I I want to be changed Lord I I I I got to get out of here Lord Jesus Jesus we've got to get out of here we can see the T signs of the times Lord creeping through the world hurricanes and things disasters all around the land and causing many people's hearts to fail with fear Lord Jesus we're looking to your promises Lord Jesus and you gave a promise Lord God that you would come down yourself and give us a shout and a voice and a trump Lord God to get us out of here Lord God I pray Lord that you'll change our hearts Lord God my hand is lifted up Lord because I want every bit of meanness every bit of enity all of the things all the carnality to be dropped away from my life I want more of you Lord God I want to be changed until there's nothing left but you living in me Lord Lord God lord I know that's all of our desires this morning Lord Jesus Lord you give us a promise Lord Jesus a promise to be like you Lord that's see what our purpose is you'll regenerate our life that's the promise of the Holy Ghost a regenerated life a life lived by the word where you can actually express your word in US Lord God and I pray this morning Lord if there's anybody here that's lacking anybody that's here that's falling short I pray God that you'll keep drawing at their heart till they just can't get away from it Lord you pricked it Paul's heart Saul when he was running from you till he couldn't he just ran and until he caught he couldn't run anymore Saul Saul Why th why do thou kick us against the Pricks and maybe there's some this morning that have been kicking against the [Music] Pricks and now is the time to stop running yeah if you've been running won't you just stop won't you come on home like the prodical son I believe I believe even prodical Sons returning can't you hear him calling this morning can't you hear the voice of God stirring your soul stirring the water he's drawing you why don't we sing something to [Music] himay and I begin to cry [Music] in my mind just fa to know exactly why you ever feel like that something stir in your soul I can explain why don't you just give up to this morning the it's time to start running away and start running to him it must be God here in my soul cuz I feel oh it ain't the ministry P it's a deep call to the deep and if there's something drawing you you know there's something out there it's Christ
