[2:28] also in the massage why Christ speak
[2:30] brother said uh Moses was born a proper
[2:33] child no one else could take his place
[2:36] he was ordained for the
[2:38] job uh brother says like pre
[2:42] predestination he was
[2:47] predestined uh let's go to let's go to
[2:50] Exodus uh
[2:58] 23
[3:15] 232 to
[3:22] 24 Moses was given an angel and brother
[3:24] Brandon was given an
[3:26] angel so Exodus 23
[3:34] 20 to
[3:37] 24 behold I sent an angel before thee to
[3:41] keep thee in the way and to bring thee
[3:43] into the place which I have prepared
[3:46] beware of him and obey his voice provoke
[3:49] him not for he will not pardon your
[3:53] transgressions for my name is in him but
[3:56] Thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do
[3:59] all that I speak then I will bring I
[4:02] will be an enemy unto the enemies and
[4:05] adversary unto the adversaries for the
[4:08] Angels shall go before thee and bring
[4:12] the into the all the Hittites canites
[4:15] all good and I will cut them off so he
[4:19] promised that he will take care of all
[4:21] their enemies already thou shall not bow
[4:23] down to their gods nor serve them nor do
[4:26] after their works but thou shal utterly
[4:30] overthrow
[4:31] them and quite break down their
[4:37] images when the angel came to brother he
[4:39] told
[4:41] him he told him if you get the people to
[4:45] believe nothing will stand in your way
[4:48] when you pray even cancer
[4:55] right and your little thing right here
[4:57] in the
[4:58] numbers right at the top it says numb
[5:01] 14:22 because all those all those men
[5:05] which have seen my glory and my Miracles
[5:08] which I did in Egypt in the wilderness
[5:10] and have tempted me now these 10 times
[5:13] have had not hearkened to my
[5:16] voice actually I I was reading all over
[5:18] and I found more than 10 complaint but
[5:22] uh we're going to go with this because
[5:25] we probably won even have time to cover
[5:26] all of
[5:28] that
[5:30] let's go to
[5:35] uh let's start with the first complaint
[5:37] is Exodus
[5:41] 14:10 1410 to
[5:58] 14
[6:01] Exodus
[6:14] 14 10 to
[6:17] 15 and when Pharaoh Drew nigh the
[6:21] children of Israel lifted up their eyes
[6:23] and behold the Egyptians marched after
[6:25] them and they were so afraid and the
[6:28] children of Israel cried out un to the
[6:29] Lord and they said unto Moses because
[6:32] there were no graves in Egypt that have
[6:35] has taken us away to die in the
[6:37] wilderness wherefore H has thou dealt
[6:39] thus with us to carry us forth out of
[6:42] Egypt is not this the word that we had
[6:46] be tell thee in Egypt saying let us
[6:50] alone that we may serve the Egyptians
[6:52] for it had been better for us to serve
[6:54] the Egyptian than that we should die in
[6:57] the wilderness and Moses said un to
[6:59] their people fear ye not stand still and
[7:02] see their salvation of the Lord which he
[7:05] will show to you today for the Egyptians
[7:09] you ye have seen today you shall see
[7:12] them again no
[7:14] more long
[7:17] forever the Lord shall fight for you and
[7:20] and you shall hold your peace and the
[7:23] Lord said unto
[7:25] Moses wherefore thou C th unto me speak
[7:29] speak unto the children of Israel that
[7:31] they may go
[7:43] forward and uh lifting him out of a
[7:46] history brother said uh Moses when he
[7:50] had who led the children of Israel Into
[7:52] the Wilderness and he came to the Red
[7:54] Sea and the mountains on the one side
[7:55] and the desert on the other and
[7:57] Pharaoh's Army this way and the Red Sea
[8:00] in ahead of them and they were trapped
[8:03] in a little net seemed like that even NE
[8:06] C out what's going to happen they're
[8:09] finished Pharaoh's Army by the tens of
[8:12] thousand to write them down and what did
[8:14] the people begin to do murmur and
[8:18] complain okay be be better off we stay
[8:22] back in our place where we were at but
[8:25] there was one among
[8:26] them those people who had the flame of
[8:29] God's faith burning in his heart who
[8:32] believed that a historical God could
[8:34] raise on the scene in any kind of
[8:36] difficult Moses stood with his hands up
[8:39] to God and prayed until the god of
[8:41] History rose on the scene to be a God in
[8:44] the present day and he opened the way
[8:48] and Israel went through the waters on
[8:50] dry
[8:54] land and the message uh while Christ
[8:57] speake said now you remember remember he
[9:00] already prophesied here for he said the
[9:04] the Egyptians that you see today you
[9:05] shall see them no more
[9:08] forever you'll see them no more and
[9:10] immediately began to cry out God what
[9:13] can we do see after he had done a pretty
[9:17] good job and in prophesying that you see
[9:19] he done he done told them what would
[9:22] happen if if the word of God was in him
[9:26] it was in him and and he when he was
[9:29] telling that actually come to pass what
[9:32] he said was already going to come to
[9:34] pass and here he was crying out what am
[9:37] I going to
[9:40] do so Moses did cry too like everybody
[9:43] else
[9:52] did uh number
[9:55] two Exodus 15
[10:01] 23-
[10:16] 26 and when they came to Maria they
[10:19] could not drink of the water of Maria
[10:21] for they were bitter therefore the name
[10:24] of it was called
[10:27] Mara and the people murmur against Moses
[10:31] saying what shall we drink and he cried
[10:34] unto the Lord and the Lord showed him a
[10:36] tree which he had cast into the
[10:40] waters the waters were made sweet there
[10:43] he made for them a statue and an ordance
[10:46] and there he proved to them and he said
[10:50] thou will delinquently harden to the
[10:52] voice of the Lord thy God and will do
[10:55] that which is right in his sight and
[10:58] will give you here to his Commandments
[11:00] and gave all his statutes I will put n
[11:04] these diseases upon thee which I have
[11:07] had brought upon the Egyptians for I am
[11:10] the Lord that Health thee
[11:15] Amen on the bottom of my Scorpio Bible
[11:17] it says uh this uh bitter Waters were in
[11:21] the very path of the Lord's leading and
[11:24] stand for the trials of God's people
[11:27] which are Ed ucat and not putative the
[11:31] tree is a cross which became sweet to
[11:35] the to Christ as the expression of the
[11:37] father's will when our Mars are so taken
[11:42] we cast the tree into the
[11:57] waters let's go to Exodus
[12:01] 16 1 to
[12:11] 3 and they took their Journey from Ila
[12:14] and all the congregation of children of
[12:15] Israel came into the Wilderness of s
[12:17] which is between Elam and Si on the 15th
[12:22] day of the second month after their
[12:24] departing out of the land of Egypt and
[12:27] the whole Congregation of children
[12:28] Israel murmur against Moses and Aaron in
[12:31] the wilderness and the children of
[12:34] Israel said unto them W to God we had
[12:37] died by the hand of the Lord in the land
[12:40] of Egypt when we said by the flesh pots
[12:43] and when we did eat bread to the F for
[12:46] ye have brought us forth into this
[12:48] Wilderness to kill this whole assembly
[12:51] with Hunger then said the Lord unto
[12:53] Moses behold I will rain bread from
[12:56] heaven for you and the people shall go
[12:58] go out and gather a certain rate every
[13:02] day that I may prove to them whether
[13:04] they will walk in my law or no and it
[13:07] shall come to pass that on the sixth day
[13:10] they shall prepare that which they bring
[13:12] in and it shall be twice as much as they
[13:15] gather daily and Moses and Aaron said
[13:18] unto all the children of Israel at even
[13:21] then you shall know that the Lord had
[13:23] brought you out from the land of Egypt
[13:26] and in the morning then you shall see
[13:27] the glory of the Lord for that he heard
[13:31] heard your murmurings against the Lord
[13:34] and what are we that you should murmur
[13:37] against us and Moses said this shall be
[13:41] when the Lord shall give you in the
[13:44] evening flesh to eat and in
[13:46] the morning bread to the full for the
[13:50] Lord had heard your murmurings which you
[13:52] murmur against him and what are we you
[13:55] murmurings are not against us but
[13:57] against the Lord
[14:04] and Moses spake unto Aaron saying say
[14:08] onto all the congregation the children
[14:09] of Israel come near before the Lord for
[14:12] he had heard your murmurs and it came to
[14:14] pass as Aaron spake unto the whole
[14:16] Congregation of children of Israel that
[14:19] they look toward the Wilderness and
[14:20] behold the glory of the Lord appeared in
[14:23] the cloud and the Lord spake unto Moses
[14:26] saying I heard the murmurings of the
[14:28] children of Israel be come to them
[14:30] saying at even you shall eat flesh in
[14:33] the morning you shall be filled with
[14:35] bread and you shall know that I'm the
[14:37] Lord your God and it came to pass at the
[14:40] evening the quills came up and covered
[14:43] the camp and in the morning the D lay
[14:46] around but about the
[14:57] host
[15:03] number four is uh Exodus 19:21 it talks
[15:07] about uh when they're Gathering the Mana
[15:10] they uh they disobey Moses
[15:14] to to leave leave leave none until
[15:18] morning and Moses was was was Wrath and
[15:22] so and and the Mana Brew worms and and
[15:27] snuck
[15:55] let's go to number seven which is uh
[15:58] says
[16:27] 32
[16:33] and when the people saw that Moses
[16:35] delayed to come down out of the mouth
[16:37] the people gather themselves together
[16:39] unto Aaron and said unto him make us
[16:42] Gods we shall go before us for as for
[16:46] this Moses the man that brought us out
[16:49] of the land of Egypt we will not what it
[16:52] become of him and Aaron said unto them
[16:55] break off the Golden Earrings which are
[16:57] in the ears of your wives of your sons
[17:00] and of your daughters and bring them
[17:01] unto me and the people broke off
[17:06] the earrings which were in their ears
[17:09] and brought them unto Aaron and he
[17:11] received them at their hand and fasten
[17:14] with a grave to after he made it a
[17:17] molded a calf and they said these be thy
[17:20] Gods oh Israel which brought the up out
[17:23] of the land of Egypt and when Aaron saw
[17:26] it he built an altar for an Aaron made
[17:30] Proclaim and said to tomorrow is a feast
[17:32] to the Lord and they rose up early in
[17:35] the morning Morrow and offer burnt
[17:39] offerings and brought peace offerings
[17:41] and the people sat down to eat to drink
[17:43] and Rose up to play right and the Lord
[17:47] said unto Moses go get the down for thy
[17:50] people which thou has brought out of the
[17:51] land of Egypt have corrupted themselves
[17:54] they have turned aside quickly out of
[17:56] the way which commanded them that they
[17:59] have made the mo calf and have worshiped
[18:01] it and have sacrificed there unto and
[18:04] said the these be thy gods of Israel
[18:07] which have brought thee out of the land
[18:09] of Egypt and the Lord said unto Moses I
[18:12] have seen these people and behold as a
[18:15] stiff neck people now therefore let me
[18:18] alone that my WRA May wax heart against
[18:22] them and that I may consume them and I
[18:24] will make thee of every
[18:27] nation
[18:51] let's go
[18:52] to
[18:54] numbers uh 12 1 to 3
[19:17] 15 now Moses didn't have enough problems
[19:20] with two million people complaining his
[19:22] brother and a sister complain
[19:26] too and miror and AR SP against Moses
[19:30] because of the Ethiopian woman whom he
[19:32] had married for he had married an
[19:34] Ethiopian woman and they said had the
[19:36] Lord indeed spoke only by Moses had he
[19:41] not spoken also by us and the Lord heard
[19:43] it and now the man Moses was very Meek
[19:47] above all the men which were upon the
[19:49] face of the earth and the Lord spake s
[19:52] suddenly unto Moses and Aaron and unto
[19:55] Mir Come Ye the three unto to the
[19:58] Tabernacle of the congregation and they
[20:01] three came out and the L and the Lord
[20:04] came and uh came down in the pillar of
[20:08] the cloud and stood in the door of the
[20:09] Tabernacle and
[20:12] called Aaron and mirin and they both
[20:15] came forth and he said hear now my words
[20:18] if there be a prophet among you I the
[20:21] Lord will make myself known unto him in
[20:24] a vision and I will speak unto him in a
[20:27] dream my servant Moses is not so who is
[20:30] faithful in all my house with him will I
[20:33] speak mouth to
[20:35] mouth even apparently not in dark
[20:38] speeches and in similitude of the Lord
[20:42] shall he behold where or then
[20:46] we then were ye not afraid to speak
[20:50] against my servant Moses and the anger
[20:52] of the Lord was kindled against them and
[20:54] he departed and the cloud departed from
[20:58] off the Tabernacle and behold mirian
[21:00] became lepos white as snow and Aaron
[21:03] looked upon Miran and behold she Le and
[21:08] Aaron said unto Moses all my Lord I
[21:11] beseech thee lay not the sin upon us
[21:14] where we have done foolishly and when we
[21:17] have sinned let her not be one as dead
[21:21] of whom the Flesh and is half consumed
[21:25] when he come out of his mother's womb
[21:28] and Moses Cried unto the
[21:32] Lord cry cry cry
[21:36] cry and Moses Cried unto the Lord saying
[21:39] heal her now oh Lord I beseech thee and
[21:42] the Lord said unto Moses if her father
[21:46] has spit it in her face should she not
[21:49] be ashamed seven days let her not be
[21:52] shut out let her be shut out from the
[21:56] camp 7even days and after that let her
[21:59] be received in the C again and Mary was
[22:03] shut out of the from the camp 7even days
[22:07] and the
[22:08] people Journey not till Maran was
[22:11] brought in again so they they stopped
[22:14] for seven days because of
[22:16] Maran oh yeah seven
[22:20] days
[22:21] all all those people because of one lady
[22:25] no wonder it took them 40 years
[22:39] didn't say just the women
[22:42] M no B brother in the in the message I
[22:46] think is
[22:48] the children of
[22:51] Israel even bam got in there he said uh
[22:55] look at here the children of Israel did
[22:56] this and that children surely a holy God
[22:58] would have to curse that people like
[23:00] that but he failed to see that SM
[23:04] smitten Rock the Brazen serpent the
[23:06] atonement that forgave their sins he
[23:09] also said uh today no matter what the
[23:11] church does has done the atonement the
[23:14] blood of Jesus Christ still atones for
[23:16] our
[23:20] sins he also says that talking to Moses
[23:25] he said God gave you the promise that
[23:26] the healing your healing your health the
[23:29] Holy Spirit but you have to fight for it
[23:32] he said you might have to cut through
[23:33] the Methodist Baptist pres and so on he
[23:37] said don't bow down to their gods it's
[23:39] yours take
[23:43] it I get this right
[23:49] here you guys will probably like this
[23:52] uni in time and and uni in time and sign
[23:55] brother
[23:56] said
[23:58] because I think one of the horribl thing
[24:00] is to see a woman man or woman that's
[24:02] constantly complaining I was thought God
[24:05] keep me from it see that that we that we
[24:09] can State all the time you know but I
[24:11] think one of the most horrible things is
[24:13] for Satan to Crown some person's life a
[24:16] crab old man or an old
[24:19] woman I want my life crown with a glory
[24:22] of God his longsuffering gentleness
[24:25] peace sness and filled with the Holy
[24:27] Spirit
[24:28] he said I'm know I'm I'm in the F
[24:31] fleshing red light of his coming of his
[24:33] sign of his coming he said I'm getting
[24:36] old I know that each day I get a new
[24:38] ache and new pain right brother yes we
[24:42] get a new ache and new pain every one of
[24:44] us you might as well tell the truth I
[24:47] thought God don't let
[24:51] me one of the most miserable things is
[24:53] to see a man or woman who has never
[24:56] accepted Christ and just live as an old
[25:00] MOS B MOS B I don't know that's country
[25:03] talk I
[25:04] guess MOS back church member meaner than
[25:08] Satan himself oh God I know give me
[25:11] Grace to never complain I want my life
[25:13] to Lord I want my life my people's life
[25:17] God grant that our life could be crowned
[25:19] no matter if we suffer whatever takes
[25:23] place how me how many
[25:25] turns against me I hope get I hope that
[25:29] God never let Satan Crown me as an old
[25:32] crab indiffer man and my wife and all
[25:35] nagging
[25:36] woman or
[25:39] you I you
[25:42] guys wife or are you that that way I
[25:46] pray brother that our lives will be
[25:48] crowned with the fruits of the spirit
[25:50] love joy long suffering gentleness
[25:53] patience truth faith and the Holy
[25:56] Spirit
[26:04] and the spoken words is the orig SE said
[26:06] I remember one time a man named Moses
[26:09] those people constantly we call it in
[26:11] our Southern expression aggravated him
[26:15] just constantly kept him on the move
[26:17] everything with a murmur or a complaint
[26:19] and so forth but Moses when he come to
[26:22] The Showdown when God said separate
[26:24] yourself from them because I'm going to
[26:27] take you and start a new nation Moses
[26:29] threw himself on the path of God's bre
[26:32] said take me and not the
[26:34] people that he called Rebels rebellions
[26:39] against God and against him yet he loved
[26:42] them so much till he said take me and
[26:45] save them that was Christ and Moses amen
[26:49] thank you call
[26:54] for looking at me like it wasn't me
[27:04] first
[27:06] out
