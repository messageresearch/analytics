five as a matter of fact anybody else had more than five it's not fun a lot of pain very painful but I've learned how to El uh raise my pain level so that it I can tolerate pain but uh around uh September 18th I uh had a pain hit me in my uh back a little higher than what would have been a kidney stone but I thought it was a kidney stone so carried it around for a week or two and then I decided I'd go to the doctor and get checked out and we did a urine test and everything we normally do when we he checks me and he calls me uh that was around the 18th on the 21st he called me and said uh there's no evidence of a stone and uh I said where's the pain coming from he said I don't know he said I'm going to order you an MR so well I got a call about the MRI and they said you need to come in so here's what they found your body's full of cysts your the right flank pain you have could be caused by a cancer the kidney you have cyst scattered on your liver your cold spleen your pancreas has a 7 mm SS with lesions 3 mm in length both kidneys have CED 2.4 by 2.3 CM 8x7 mm leion Li noes 8 mm s both so we can only imagine from September to now what I've been walking it it's affected my breathing at some point I told wait I said I may have to give up saying it because my lung capacity didn't feel like it's right I'd stop you see me stop in the middle of a verse or so so they said I have five G Stones okay on top of that like I needed something else so he said the right pain the flank pain and Amy's looked at my charts and talked about the you I said what caused that pain how long what about the pain and he says well this is what happens in that that sister Bur first and it's like a releasing stuff in your body so so we're going to watch it so I come back the pain gets a little sharper and and because when I had a m i in 2007 brother Dale remembers they talk they thought that was cancer at one time and we got through that the Lord healed me before I was supposed to finish my 45-day treatment well anyway so he comes back and says I'm going to do another MRI I came up here New Year's Eve and the brother preaching I laid hands on me and prayed wday

Open the Eyes of My Heart Is brother Daryl Ward from Johnson City Tennessee comes and brings a word to US Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you you want to see him today you're going to see him I want to see you opening the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you amen oh Jesus I want to see you to see you high and lift it up shining in the light of your [Music] glory pour out your power and love as we sing Holy Holy Holy high and LIF it up shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing Holy Hy holy oh holy holy holy You Are Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy I want to see you hallelujah hallelujah it would be something if you had a desire to see him and yet there was no way that that could possibly be how miserable we would be but there's a deep that calls unto the deep and if there's something in US longing to see him that's the evidence there's a himm for us to see he's the same yesterday today and forever if you have your Bibles turn with us to the book of Acts want to read from Acts chapter 28 starting at verse one and I know you've done been here for a while so we'll be just as quick as we can and we pray the Lord to just bless you in a great way today and we appreciate the testimonies and I was thinking he was talking about the prayer Clause while you're turning there I remember I think it was 2012 or 13 it it was the year that Haiti had the earthquake when we was in Nicaragua for the Youth Camp that year at a place called Skylark and we had a huge prayer line that evening and so we was tearing off pieces of our handker and giv it to the young people and said now when the Lord meets your need you send this back to us as a testimony of what the Lord did for you and before the prayer line was over those that was in front of the line was coming back around and giving us pieces of the C call back the Lord amen it was wonderful I remember one year there's a a brother came through the prayer line he was almost been over at a 90 degree angle I don't know if brother Louise was there that that year or not but he was been over almost at he a brick layer had blowed out his back laying brick and he came through the prayer line and and before he got out the end of it the Lord had healed killed the man and he was standing straight up and he shouted that place to the ground it's just wonderful what God can do amen but he's the same right here in Lula Georgia amen acts chap 28 verse1 we appreciate the opportunity to be here this morning appreciate brother Samuel and brother Wade acts 281 do you love him amen and when they were escaped and they knew that the was called milita I guess is how you say it I'm not the sharpest knife in the drawer and the barbarus people showed us no little kindness for they kindled a fire and received us everyone because of the present rain and because of the cold and when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire there came a viper out of the Heat and fastened on his hand and when The Barbarians saw that the venomous Beast hang on his hand they said among themselves no doubt this man is a murderer whom though he has escaped the sea yet Vengeance suffereth not to live and Paul shook off the Beast Into the Fire and felt no harm and how be it that they looked and when he should have swollen up or fallen down dead suddenly but after they looked a great while and saw no harm come to him they changed their minds and said that he was a God how F oh my how fast their opinion of Paul changed from being a murderer to a god when the snake venom met faith and that's what we want to speak on this morning when Faith was met Amen Let Us bow our heads God Heavenly Father Thy word is true I commit this congregation and myself into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus name God bless you Saints you may be seated now brother brandom's taught us in the message perfect Faith he says perfect faith is the master of all circumstances amen perfect Faith Masters all circumstances no matter what it is right it Masters it now just watch when you believe anything or do anything you've got to have faith in what you're doing we live in such a wishy-washy age when people are up and down and one day they're on fire and the next day they're cold and one day they're going but that's not what faith is when we come through those doors we need to come through those doors with a realization I am here for a purpose God could have put me in any age he wanted to put me in but he put me in this age amen and he never put me here to fail but he put me here to overcome Hallelujah I am a Son of God whether I'm on the Mountaintop shouting the victory or whether I'm in the greatest battle of my life it does not determine who I am amen and when we come through those doors we need to come with the realization I am a son and a daughter of God and I have come to Rack havoc on Satan's kingdom Hallelujah Faith Masters that circumstance regardless of what it is you see faith is not a Hocus Pocus it's not a magic wand that you just wave over someone faith is not even what you feel Faith is what you believe amen and faith has to have a resting place and the Bible teaches us that the word of God is the foundation that Faith rest upon the Bible says in Romans 3:4 said let God be true and every man a liar heavens and earth will pass away but not one word of God will fail us then we can sit here this morning with this confidence that God's word does not lie Nations will lie to us governments will lie to us politicians they'll lie to us and sometimes even people who are close to us will lie to us our feelings will lie to us our emotions will lie to us our Sensations will lie to us but the word of God Amen will never lie to us and every word of God is just as true as every word of God it's either all true or none of it's true the same God that said let there be light is there light did God keep his word that same God said behold I send you Elijah did he send him did he keep his word that same God said I am the Lord thy God who Health all thy diseases Hallelujah and how does God prove his word to us God proves his word to us by bringing it to pass oh my the prophet said how I love him God always keeps his word God will keep his word every time not 99 times out of a 100 those are pretty good odds I bet Vegas would like to have some odds like that that may be good for Vegas but it ain't good for God not 99 times out of 100 but 100 times out of a 100 God will keep his word faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word of God when you hear what the word is saying to you you see it's a personal revelation you're not going to go because you're setting in a message Church the devil goes to a message Church come on somebody but what is the new birth it's not signing your name on a row it's not shaking a preacher's hand it's not packing a spoken word book but what is the new birth it's Christ revealed to you personally Hallelujah you have met this person amen oh my it's a personal revelation you and the word personally Hallelujah then no matter what the circumstance is it don't got one thing to do with it well the doctor says it's bad the situation is impossible circumstances has nothing to do with it when God says it'll be a certain way it will will be that way I remember when my daughter was struck by train and two of my family was killed and and they gave us no hope and the doctors that I worked with I worked in surgery I could read MRIs and CT scans and I knew all the medical terminology and they were coming to me and putting her arm around me and telling me we're sorry Daryl your daughter's hurt too bad she can't live her brain is damaged but God spoke to me Hallelujah sitting there in the waiting area at about 2:00 in the afternoon and he said you're daughter shall live then it don't matter what the doctor says it don't matter what the CT SC God's word is true amen hallelu hallelujah will you just imagine that you can say what you will all I know is she's 30 year old today amen hallelujah Faith Masters that circumstance amen Faith believes that God will work work it out I don't know how he's going to do it but he's going to do it but he'll do it anyhow Faith Masters that circumstance and many times God don't ask us to understand on right sometimes God says can you just trust me can you trust me that whatever you're going through right now it's for your good according to Romans 8:28 all things work to the good well I don't understand that sometimes he don't ask us to understand but say can you trust me that whatever I'm doing in your life is bringing you to Perfection hallelujah hallelujah Faith believes God will work it out I know how he's going to do it but he'll do it anyhow it Masters all circumstance you see faith and love is a relation you can't have faith unless you've got love because your faith is in a God Who is the very essence of love Faith and love works together amen you see if he loved me enough to die for me is that true if he loved us enough to die for us then don't he love us enough to heal us don't he love us enough to save me to deliver me to forgive me to Rapture me you have faith in the God who loves you and faith in what the word is saying about you Faith Masters every circumstance because it's not what you feel it's not what you see we don't see with the eyes of our head God gave us another set of eyes the eyes of our heart we see the Unseen we see what the eyes of the head cannot declare amen that's right hallelujah it's not what you see it's not what you understand or what you reason out it's what you believe when you hear what the word is saying about you then that word takes preeminence over every circumstance when you see yourself in the scriptures right like Mary the prophet of God said that that that Sunday before that wash day on Monday when they were sitting on the porch of Joseph's house and they was talking about the rabbi and about the sermon and Mary said you know I think it'd be good if we just read some scriptures and Joseph said that's an excellent ideal and the prophet of God said she went in there and pulled out the scroll of Isaiah a virgin shall conceive and he said Mary said to Joseph Joseph dear what would the prophet Isaiah mean a virgin shall conceive and he gave the most famous profound statement that was ever spoke he looked at Mary and said I don't know I don't know but there's one thing I do know if God said it God will bring it to pass and well Hallelujah and the next day on the way down on a blue Monday wash day she ran into an angel who said hell Mary thou has found favor with God and it was at that moment that Mary realized howah was speaking of her it's me the word is speaking about me hallelujah hallelujah when you see yourself in the scriptures like Paul that we read about in Acts 2310 it says there arose a great distinction and the chief Captain fearing least Paul should be pulled to pieces of them commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them and bring him into the castle he said my God they're going to kill the man go get him yeah right and that night followeth while he was in the castle the Lord stood by him and said be of good cheer Paul for thou H has testified of me in Jerusalem so must thou bow witness also at Rome so where is Paul headed to Rome why God said so how's he going to get there the circumstances doesn't matter he will get there because God said so and on his way there there arose a great storm y 14 days and nights no man ate anything that's some kind of a storm the way we love to eat that was some kind of storm right 14 days and nights and nobody took one bite of nothing but after a long absences Paul stood forth in the midst of them and said sir you should have hearkened unto me and not have loosed from crate to have gained this harm and this loss and now I exhort you to be of good cheer for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you but of the ship for there stood by me this night the angel of God who I am and whom I serve saying fear not Paul oh let us hear those words today in such a neuronic age fear not little bride it's the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom fear not Paul thou must be brought before Caesar and L God hath given thee all them that sell with thee why why did the angel come and tell that to Paul how could he say such a thing he was saying what God had already said yeah right am amen you know people come up for prayer and they say well the devil said this and the devil said that and the devil said this and I think sometimes they can't quote twoo good quotes but they can tell you everything the devil said and sometimes I wonder why do we listen to him why do you even listen to him amen stay with the word if you're going to quote something say what the word says I am an overcomer I am a son of God by his stripes I'm Healed well I don't feel healed that's got nothing to do with it we're not healed because we feel like it we're healed because the word says [Music] though amen how could the angel say such things he was saying what has already been said you must be a witness of me at Rome wherefore sir be of good cheer for I believe God anybody here believe God then be happy be in good cheer well brother Dar the economy and this and that and listen to me Trump ain't going to fix it B ain't going to fix it I'm not looking to them I'm looking to a higher order amen he told us these things would come to pass he said when you see these things begin to happen lift up your head your Redemption draws now we're not going down we're going up Hallelujah well brother darl they said one of our generals said by 2025 will'll be in a war with China and they got all these nuclear weapons and they all they got to do is push a button but let me tell you something the prophet of God said if they push that button before the bomb ever hits the United States this bride will be in glory then what are we we're just one button push away Hallelujah now the Bible says that they sounded out in heard land and some of the people on the ship started letting down these little boats acting like they were letting down anchors if I remember right the Bible says they were doing it under color yeah but Paul said listen to me yeah you better stay off those websites you better you better not get off this ship get on some of these other ships listen to me the prophet of God said there's all kind of boats in Noah's day but there's only one boat that floated well I'm going to leave the message cuz I just want to get closer to Christ yeah and then you look at Facebook and they're wearing shorts and drinking beer they're really getting close come on somebody listen young people stay away from that nonsense stay with the word what did Paul tell them listen to me Brothers you better abide with this ship you better cut them boats loose and let them go and I say cut loose of the world Cut Loose of the things of the world don't you see what this nation's trying to do they're trying to divide us the prophet of God said that the Native Americans lost this country why y because they were divided among theirselves and the prophet said in the seals he said now remember America you solded it now you're going to reap it and what are they doing right now they're trying to divide Us by skin color come on somebody you might well say Amen they're trying to divide Us by skin color they're trying to divide Us by political affiliation they're even trying to divide Us by vaccinations but that's Satan's tactic that's always been his tactic is to divide and to conquer but I say to you little bride we are united Hallelujah by the blood of the Lamb of God we are Brothers and Sisters in Christ God made us the way he wanted us to be amen amen well I don't know where that come from but that's all right the ship finally broke up from the storm but no notice what they did they took pieces of the ship and floated into the shore and building a fire to get dry and toward Paul goes and gathers klin now what a great lesson that is now Paul could have said listen boys I'm the church age messenger I'm the man of the hour I'm the prophet so I'm going to sit here and you boys go out there and get the wood no he led by example you see people's got it so wrong the bride is not a servant to the ministry but the ministry is a servant to the bride the gift that's in brother Samuel's life in brother L's life and and brother Way's life and these other brothers life brother brother black and different one that that gift that's in their life is not for them it's for you God gave you that gift here then use the gifts that's among you amen Paul he didn't set backers and you boys I'm you know he got any grapes I'm just going to no he went out there and was gathering up wood amen and bringing it in unbeknown to Paul there was a Viper that was in the wood and as he Stone it in the fire it struck him on the hand yes and the Bible said that these these these heathens if I cuz I can't say the other word if you excuse me they sat down to watch die and they said this man must be some kind of evil to escape the storm and now be bit by a deadly snake right now the Venom attacks the nervous system of this particular snake and it shuts down the breathing and they swell up and they die suddenly ain't no need to call 911 you're dead before you get the one dog they didn't even offer him any help they didn't even offer him any first step they just sat down to watching die right and that Venom coming up through Paul's body all at once that Venom met faith faith in the word that says you've got to go to Rome and appear to Caesar and when the Venom met Faith there was oh god there was no more poison in the Venom that's right Paul took the word of God over the fear of a deadly snake bot he just pitched it into the fire and gathered up more wood and the people of the island said he ain't a murderer he's a God my Lord think about that those heathens recognized that a man manifesting the word for his hour is deity in [Music] flesh they said Paul didn't say Paul didn't I didn't die cuz I he didn't say they said that God will make your enemy testify of who you are a son of God manifesting the word for his day his deity in flesh abely you got a quote for that yeah I do I'm glad you asked the prophet said when a Son of God by faith takes the word of God into his heart and speaks it back upon his lips it's just the same as deity speaking when he sat down and he didn't die they changed their mind he said this man's a god when snake vitim met Faith the three Hebrew children stay true to God's word that they would not bow their knee to the king's commandment and he heated up the furnace seven times hotter than it ever been heated so hot that it killed the men who threw them in there you talking about Insanity yeah they was trying they was trying to hurt the three Hebrew children and they killed their own men well let me say this the devil will destroy his own kingdom trying to stop this bride but I want the devil to know this morning he will never stop this bride amen they threw those boys in the fire and they testified how God is able to Deliver Us from this fiery furnace Shadrach mesach abedo they were the Seed of Abraham and they had a promise of God that his seed would possess the enemy's Gates so knew the king and his kingdom was not the gate possessors they were the gate possessors why because they were the Seed of Abraham and they stayed all God not on emotion not on sensation but based on the word of God I am the Seed of Abraham and I am the gate possessor right listen to me sints of God the devil does not control the gate you do we are the Royal Seed of Abraham through Christ did the natural seed Poss possess the gate yes they did Samson ripped up the gates backed them up on the hill threw them down said you want your Gates boys come up and get them amen thank the Lord and they stayed with God's word they had a promise that when when the king's fiery furnace met faith faith took the Heat and the smoke yes out of the fire you see the fire was still there it cuz when the king looked in if the fire had been gone he said hey it went out relighted but when he looked in he still saw the Flames oh God it's about this time we get happy at my church I'm going to try to behave but think about that he took the Heat and the smoke the fire was still there amen amen but when the King's fire met the face of the Hebrew children God took the Heat and the smoke out of the fire that's the God we serve he turns water into wine how many times does he have to do it before we'll believe him oh glory to God what about Daniel throwing in the lion did them lines knew they had an easy meal that's a Happy Meal there's nowhere for the man to go and no doubt they had ate several men in their lifetime they had an appetite for human flesh and when they saw Daniel there they said yum yum here he comes damn it think about it I thought oh my an easy this is an easy meal nowhere for him to go but when the the hungry Lions met faith faith locked their jaws the prophet said the pillar of fire stood between Daniel and the Lions and the Lions went off and meowed like kittens it went from a roar to meow oh I'm having a good time a a woman with a blood issue 12 years the bleeding would not stop can you imagine how nervous that would make you you imagine how timid afraid to go out in public to be called unclean 12 years the bleeding would not stop spent all of her money the prop said she sold the farm and everything but she saw Jesus and pressing through the crowd she believed that Jesus was the Christ anybody here believe that and she said if I can only touch the hym of His Garment she believed if she touched him she would get what she asked for and she slipped through the crowd and reached over no doubt she was small as Statue and all the people pressing in trying to touch him she couldn't get over their shoulders but was because of her statue and her timid she was got down and was reaching through their legs he said how could you say that because she touched the Hy of His Garment she didn't touch his shoulder she didn't touch his back she was all the way down probably reaching between their legs and as soon as she touched him he stopped and if her faith can stop Jesus your faith can stop him this morning amen she slipped through the crowd she reached over and she touched him believing that she said would what happen that it would happen yes notice Jesus never said listen listen sis if you touch my garment you'll get well Jesus never said it Peter never said listen listen listen I'm one of his right-hand men let me tell you you want to get a hold of him here's how you get a hold of him you just touch Peter never said that Jesus never said that who said if I could touch his touch His Garment she said it and she believed what she said oh God and her words became the very word of God oh Hallelujah her words become we read her words today and her old words brought it into manifestation amen can I say to you speak to that storm speak to that habit speak to that fear Jesus never said it Peter never said it she said it and her words became his words her faith that he was the Christ brought her own words into manifestation and when a blood issue that eluded the doctors for 12 years met Faith the bleeding stopped why Faith Masters every circumstance I was in France a few years ago as a sister came to she was a Catholic came to someone invited to the service she's sitting right here with her brother sitting with the c she speaks French I barely speak English somebody asked me one time I said you speak a foreign language I said yeah English Hu I couldn't understand her she couldn't understand me but at the end of the service I felt sorry for the woman and I just reached down and she was standing there with her hand on the cane and I just laid my hand over on her cane on her on her hand that was on the cane and I said father this poor woman's probably had a rough life probably don't understand anything that was spoken today but God in their old age just have mercy on her take her off that cane let her spend the rest of her life without the cane and I just went on and the next morning she was back in service and she said I want to testify on amise Lord and she stood up and she said I got up this morning and I didn't need my cane and I was there in 2020 right before the pandemic broke and I was there and I saw the sister since that time she's repented of her sins been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ received the Holy Ghost she had long hair she was wearing dresses and guess what she was vacuuming the church oh God I said sis you're getting younger every time I see you you're getting younger oh listen to me little bride we're not getting older we're getting [Applause] younger oh Hallelujah I think of Joshua God told him Joshua how would you to March around the walls of Jericho and they'll fall before you now these walls they say that they can run chariot races on the top of these walls if I remember right rahab's House was built on top of the wall some historians say they were 46 foot high and 80 foot thick wow and God said Joshua I want you to go up there March around so many times sound the trumpet let out a shout and the walls are going to fall down so should I should I bring a Wrecking Bar nope back hole nope bulldozer case of dynamite just go up there March around blow a trumpet and shout and the walls are going to fall down just obey my word that's that's so silly to the carnal mind yes it is people even get quiet when you talk about it and it's in the Bible 46 foot high 80 foot thick and I found this I thought it was so good the prophet said Joshua knowing how thick those walls was because he built plenty of them down in Egypt he knew the cement that was in them how tight they were to hold them together chariot races on top of them even built houses on top of them and just Jos knew all of this from an intellectual understanding but Joshua did not lead to his own understanding he believed what God Said was the truth and he obeyed his word and the walls fell down leaning not to his own understanding Joshua looked at the Unseen and he walked around the walls believing it would happen you see it all depends on what you're looking at but we don't look with the eyes of our head we look with the eyes of our heart with 46 high 46t high walls met Faith the walls came down gyus his daughter laid dead the mourners gathered to mourn and they said trouble not the master anymore your little girl is dead HL oh that's such a that's such a solid word when you hear that word dead just yep but you see Jesus gave gyrus the remedy Jesus gave gyus the remedy to every bad report he touched gyrus on the on the shoulder and he said two words y only believe amen that's all he ever asked us to do not to figure it out not to reason it out not to work it out just believe only believe Jesus standing at the grave of Lazarus a man that had been dead four days corruption had done set in even his sister said Lord he stinks but when a dead man oh God met a man who had faith in what the word said he was the prophet of God said Jesus had perfect Faith because he believed in what the word said that he was can you believe this morning in what the word says you are we are not a denomination we are not an organization we are not just a church member body but we are the body of Jesus Christ manifested on the earth bone of his bone flesh of his flesh Spirit of his Spirit yes sir the prophet said she is him Hallelujah when a dead man met a man who had faith in what the word said he was and Jesus cried out Lazarus come forth man that had been dead four days stood on his feet [Music] yeah when death met Faith the maniac of gadera let me hurry the maniac of gadera the Demons had him bound the Bible said he lived among the tombs and he cut himself with stones still having the Cutters sir but God is the remedy for Cutters I was in a meeting a few years ago down to byc camp in Louisiana there's a sister down there that was a cutter she had all these scars up and down her arms where she'd cut herself and in this particular I believe it was the sunrise service if I remember right but in this particular service the people was praising the Lord and the sisters said Lord I Want To Praise you so much I want to raise my hands to you so much but I've got these scars and I'm ashamed of them and she said a voice spoke to her and said raise your arms and give me praise and when that sister raised her arms the scars disappeared off of her arms oh Hallelujah your back's against the wall praise His name when you feel you can't go out just lift your hands and say greater is he that is in me than he that's in the world and you can praise your heart away Hallelujah thank you Lord cut himself with stones they tried to chain him and tame him but he'd break the chains and feathers and no man could tame him they tried to make him a good message believer giving him a few books in a picture of the pillar of fire but you see our young people need a birth the token must be applied I don't care if you're eight or 80 come on somebody we're not going because we believe God sent a prophet the devil believes that we're going because the token has been applied and he said when I see the blood I will pass over you you think you don't need this you need this young man Satan's just waiting to cut your throat out there you better listen to me you better hide beneath the blood America's seen its Better Days Prophet said it's going to get gradually no he said not gradually but quickly get worse and worse and worse right amen you know I read a study the other day they said that Darkness you place somebody in darkness and isolation it leads to Total Insanity and you take the darkness of Leia bu and the isolation of the pandemic and that's why they're killing each other on the streets right now and did not our prophet of God say it will come to pass that they will go totally insane amen hallelujah right that's right yes that's it it's crazy yes sir when a man thinks he's a woman and wins a swim meat yeah and they give him a trophy they should give him shock treatments come on somebody that's insane that's right when a man wins what Miss Universe cuz he's just like a woman and they go along with it it reminds me when I was a little boy and reread what was that book The Emperor's New Clothes anybody remember remember that he was going down the street naked and everybody oh the clothes are beautiful and somebody said are you crazy he ain't got no clothes [Music] on they have lost their minds and if you go along with it you need help I'm sorry amen well that's not politically correct I a't interested in being politically correct honey that's the least of my worries come on somebody well they'll shut you up they'll never shut us up the prophet said God will take us up amen what did Jesus say you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free anyway this man let me hurry this man he was demon possessed living among the tombs cutting himself day and night and no man could tame him though they tried to Tain him they tried to chain him they tried to make him a part of society that he would do good for a while and then that would come back up on him and he'd rip off the chains and rip off his clothes and go back and live among the dead but what man could not do Faith could do what brought Jesus to the galileans it wasn't the mayor the mayor never asked him to come it wasn't the organization that invited him it wasn't the pig Farmers that asked him to come they asked him to leave what brought him to the what brought him to the garans it was the maniac who was living among the tombs cutting his flesh ripping off his clothes but he wanted help and the needy Soul was crying out for deliverance and Jesus on the other side of the sea heard his invite of faith and Jesus crossed the stormy sea to get to that one Soul crying out for help and he's the same Jesus this morning he'll come from glory for one needy sold in this building I believe he'll come every time where he's wanted he'll come every every time where he's wanted you need to put that on your refrigerator he'll come every time where he's wanted but he'll never come to where he's doubted well I don't know if he can help me don't worry that doubt will keep him away if you're doubting him just remember if you're doubting him just remember he will never be at your door so don't doubt just believe well the doctor said mine's the worst case you ever saw it's just a greater Miracle Hallelujah but if you love him and you want him he'll come any time that you call for him to come he's ready to come then that tells me right now in Lula Georgia he is ready to meet every need that's in this building this morning he don't want our money come on somebody he never asked for our money but he did ask us to believe him if thou can believe all things are possible he heard his Cry of faith and if you heard his Cry of Faith he'll hear your cry of Faith you see that great storm could not stop Jesus from coming it could not drown out that cry of faith and let me say there is nothing that Satan has that can stop Faith from touching Jesus touching Jesus is all that really matters you know you feel sorry for some people they built so many walls around their life and they won't let him in oh won't you tear the walls down friends touching Jesus is all that really matters then your life will never be the same right there's only one way that you can touch him you You Must Believe when you call on his name listen I'll H When Faith Cometh From an honest heart When Faith from an honest heart meets God them cogs just comes together like that and something has to take place I challenge this audience in the name of Jesus Christ let your faith connect with God like that and in a few minutes we'll have another Pentecost there'll be such a Revival breakout in this town that there won't be enough cops in the country to keep them down that's right there will be a real Revival when your faith meets him Hallelujah listen you young people listen to this right here you don't go to hell because you're a sinner no right amen you go to hell because you refuse to accept the way away from Hell hallu there's a bypass and that's Christ there's a bypass from your sickness from a quick death from a premature grave and that's through Christ now you sined to be in the beginning you sinned in the beginning and Christ died for your sins therefore he saved you when he died he saved you and he healed you when he died for he took your place now all you have to do is accept it by faith and receive it because there's nothing more to be done your healing is already paid for that's oh can I tell it again I was in a restaurant here the other day and the waitress come she said now y'all want anything else I said no ma'am we're we're fine we could just have the check and she said well somebody saw you in here and they paid for your meal it's already paid for I said well let me leave a tip no they left the tip too it's all took care of now I had one or two things I could have sat there and argued with her said no I I don't see nobody here that I know you sure you've got the right table I don't want to walk out of here and that here come the cops I could have argued with her y yeah I could have not no no there ain't no way no I want to pay for it I want to make sure it's paid for or I could have accepted it yes and so you know what I said I said I received that thank you who ever done that thank you to this day I still don't know who done it but in your case you know who done it Jesus Christ did it for you and if you was the only person in Lula Georgia the only young person he would have went to Calvary for you if he was the only person ever sick he would have took every stripe on his back for your healing that's how much he loves you sometimes it's so hard for us to accept love right brother but I want you to understand man's love may be conditional you do this I'll do that but that's not the way God works his love is unconditional while we were yet sinners God loved us and died for us amen thank you Lord if you can accept it if you can receive it this afternoon it's yours there's nothing more to be done your healing is already paid for you can have it there right this afternoon you can have it right now amen the very minute you believe it when your faith meets God's requirements absolutely am but you know oh I got to quit do you know we live we live in such a impatient age before the preaching even starts people's looking at their watch it's truth you know years ago a man living in the East and his family out west he would write a letter John how you do it he give it to a guy on a horse he'd ride that horse to death give it to another guy ride the horse death another guy ride the horse about a month or so later John would get the letter and he'd answer it and they'd ride a horse to death and ride a horse to death and ride a horse to death and you get the answer to his letter and John say doing pretty good but now we live in an age when we send the text if it don't go through you're smacking your phone that's right I'm not going to ask who's guilty but I can see it on your face but you see God don't always work that way Congressman Upshaw fell and broke his back as an 18yearold boy 62 years later Hall he come out of a wheelchair that's right how many years did he pray for his

a prayer and then when he said that I I said Lord that's just like it was it's a tabernacle I could hear brother brandham say you know today just reach over and take somebody by the hand or reach over and touch said we're going to see something great today you know what God spoke to me and he said I'm the same here as I was there yes he's the same here we love to Revel in the days of brother Brandon and listen to the prayer lines what about today what about right now same God same atmosphere same people yes sir the bride they were bride back there the bride here amen God bless you good to have each and every one of you here good to be in the house of the Lord see what you miss when you don't come to church this is good I like this you know you miss a lot but you know what you miss you miss fellowshipping with God right cuz he just dropped down after we did after we laid hands on each other he just he just it just dropped and you could see the virtue go out of that man you see him that's right he poured his heart out he ain't got nothing left and that's okay you know my football coach he said we might get beat 60 to nothing he said but if I have to drag you off the field and you look up at me and say I did my best he said that's all I want to here that's right so today brother Daryl did his best and you did your best by pulling on the yeah and I believe we're going to see a lot that's why we bring ministers in that's why we have special meetings it's not for brother Daryl or myself it's for you it's for you to get something for you to get something fresh from God Amen and if you'll be seated just for a few minutes what sister Bella wants to give her testimony just for a little bit and uh before we dismiss and everybody's got something to something to give so we our sisters going to give us a this one this one okay all right okay I'll just make it quick but um pretty much when we came back from Nicaragua it felt like really any other trip that I've gone to cuz you know I grew up with with missionary parents and and so it's nothing whenever you go usually you just expect the same mundane thing my dad goes and preaches it's super hot and then it's just a lot of rice and beans it's just a very mundane thing for me cuz I've just been doing it for so long right and um you know I was able to take Nyla Michael and Jordan with me and that was super great loved it but the entire Camp nothing really happened in terms of me being able to bring something back and in my mind that wasn't that big of a deal cuz I wasn't expecting to say anything anyway but um then brother Wade asked me to say something and then I I was like I don't know what I'm going to say cuz nothing happened this time and so when we got back home you know I I made some new friends so you know they all found me on Instagram they all wanted my number so you know we were texting back and forth I was texting one of my friends and we were just talking and she started telling me about what had happened to her a year ago and she said that she had had this 10 plus year relationship with these two girls girls and she said that jealousy and envy got in between their relationship and it completely broke everything off and so pretty much what happened was she got super backstabbed a bunch of times and she ended up falling into depression and anxiety she got diagnosed she was taking meds for it and during that entire time she was having to take medication for it and um she lost a bunch of weight because of it it and I had seen her at the camps but I didn't really talk to her but she found me and so we were just we were just texting back in forth and she said um yeah I just lost a bunch of weight and I feel terrible because I can't gain that weight back and as soon as she said that it clicked to me that reminded me exactly of my mom because my mom all of her life has been super skinny and all of you know that she's just she's that's just her makeup and she when she was growing up she would cry about it because it was something so sensitive to her that she couldn't control and so I started telling her about my mom and then she was telling me but your mom's so beautiful your mom's so talented and in my head my I've always seen my mom as normal looking but I know that she's skinny I know she's not like she's not exactly the skinny that everyone else sees but I've always seen her as very normal cuz I grew up with her and so this sister her name is ISA she was telling me but your mom's so beautiful she walks around with so much confidence and she's so tall and the sisters in Nicaragua are super short okay so she's like she's so tall she's so light skinned she's so pretty I'm all dark I'm super short um my hair is not that thick I'm super skinny I'm skin and bone I don't play any instruments I don't sing and I just started telling her about my mom and she I could feel that her face was building up from the other side of the screen amen and thank you Lord she I haven't talked to her in a few days but her mother has told me that she's been singing her heart out and that she hasn't stopped smiling and I didn't expect anything to happen after after Nicaragua yeah I really just thought that I'm just a Minister's daughter that's it and so that's just all I had to say and I didn't even think I was going to cry but she's such a close friend to me I don't have an older sister she's 20 and so my relationship with her has just grown so close and I'm just so proud of her and what she's able to do now it's only been a couple of days since I told her that but she she's apparently improving so much in her self-confidence and everything else so I just want you guys to keep her in prayer CU she deserves the absolute best okay her name is Sister Isa she's 20 years old she lives in Chinandega so just keep her in your prayers [Music] okay you don't think anything's happening don't worry something's happening let's stand to our feet anybody have anything else we've we've we've had a good day we've had a real good day Lord good to see each and every one of you here good to have you all with us thank you for serving the lord in the way that you feel like serving the lord just Rebecca did you have your hand up uh yeah come on everybody sit back down thank amen um I actually I was I was going to give this testimony earlier but um I didn't have time and I was asking um brother um brother thank you brother Terry but um it was too late so I figured I said well Lord if you want me to give this testimony let at the end of the service let him let somebody speak up and say does anybody else got something to say so that that's right there thank you um this is um I know we know the story of the prodical son and I have a testimony of I want it's similar but it's the prodical daughter and it got to do with me and my mother um we grew up in the message so growing up in the message we would go to tape services and we would visit other churches and it was just normal to me it was normal it was the norm it wasn't nothing um unusual so um as I was growing up though it wasn't like I was exactly knowing what was going on it was just kind of like it just something you do you get up and go to church and that's it we knew about my mom testimonies and stuff and U my dad also was a Believer so it was normal so um as I got older I I drifted away so I wasn't um as I see some of you young people you sticking in church you doing good I was I drifted away my family broke up and everything so we was already in a broken situation so when your family's not together you are you you kind of just you kind of just you know you just kind of like hey okay I'm I'm free I didn't have nobody kind of um supervising me too much when we got out there we just was free we lived in a neighborhood full of kids so we would just go hang out and have fun but anyway as I turned into a teenager um like I said I took some path that I'm not too proud of and I was stand my mom at the time um I was 14 I was staying with my mother and I started being really rebellious really rebellious skipping school I didn't like the situation I was in living with her and um she was a good mom but at the time my stepdad I wasn't used to him he was really strict and my my biological father wasn't so when this my stepdad is around now he's telling me what to do and you need to watch her at school go check on her to school I was like man what is this this is just my life is ruin you know cuz my dad never was like that my real dad so anyway that started changing my mother attitude because he's getting on her to get on me and um I start getting rebellious to her cuz now she's becoming a new person so um I started getting really out of hand skipping school and everything so finally they came to me one day and was like look we're going to give you a decision to make either you abide by the rules or you go move with dad my dad so to me that sound like the golden like thank you this is exactly what I wanted to hear this is like the golden voice I wanted to hear so I I jumped on that I was like I want to go stay with Dad CU I knew my dad wasn't going to be monitoring me and at that age you feel like man I'm this is the beginning of Life you know and uh I went to go live with my dad but that was the beginning of Hell Gates opening up for me as well and uh I end up stealing my older sister's ID she was 6 years older than me I stole her ID end up getting a a permit with her age on it but my face on the picture so I'm I'm 20 so I can go anywhere in Atlanta and that's exactly what I did went ran all over Atlanta different clubs and doing all these things and one day I got caught up really it started getting darker and darker like when when you start entering into sin it take you further than you thought you was going to go cuz it's enticing at first and it's like wow I can do all these things and Satan is just telling you exactly what to do how to do it how to sneak around and do it but he don't tell you how deep he about to take you and he took me really really deep really deep where I'm not going to say a lot of things but use your imagination so I started working at an adult Club um at 14 okay and uh like I said it got really deep and dark I started uh isolating myself for my parents my brothers and sisters they was already in college and kind of on their own so it was just me I didn't have nobody to answer to nobody was monitoring over me so um I just started isolating myself I didn't keep in touch with my family at this time my dad was going through his own thing so I was on my own I moved out from him was living in a place by myself like a rooming house so we had like different roommates and stuff so my mom had no idea where I was at this was over a period of two years so um I was 16 now so one day um I'll let her tell this part oh one day um when I was getting ready to go to work that day at this the place I was working at a club I that night I'm sorry I left my key inside of the club so when I when I took a cab home I realized I didn't have my house key I couldn't get in so I went back to the spot I was working at but it was already closed so I had to make a decision to go stay at the hotel that was close by and I just figured okay I'll just get up in the morning and go to work I don't usually work in the morning I usually work at night so uh that morning I woke up woke up went to the um went back to the club went back there and got sat down and ate and everything somebody came back there and said um somebody here to see you a lady and uh I'm like a lady you know in that lifestyle you used to a man coming to see you so when I hear a lady here to see you I'm like what so I come out and from where I'm at I look down probably like the same distance of the double doors I look down I see like a small image of a lady that's shaped like my mother and Lord hes know that my mom is at the spot where I'm at and I'm super shocked because she didn't know where I was at and I'll let her tell the part that yeah how she got there well when I couldn't find Rebecca I was just praying all the time all every day I didn't know where to find her I don't know what happened to her and I know one day I was walking home from the bus and someone pull over a person a young man want to give me a ride oh I knew the man so I said yeah and he said you know Rebecca you know where break her at I said no he said I'm going to tell you something I don't want to let her know I told you I'm going tell you exactly where she at she working at a club at such and such a place he said don't never ever tell her I was so happy he told me now I know to go where to find her now so I didn't go to those places I don't want nobody see me that know me see me stepping in a place like that so when I went to the door now I asking you know I see some young lady was going inside I asked if they know Rebecca they said no we don't know who Rebecca I said well that's my daughter you know they said well that's a real name I said yeah they said no in this place here we don't use their real name and she said she was she going to find who she is cuz he a young girl working here now I bet that's her she's going to find her so she went back there yeah so they came back there and got me and like I said I look and see an image of a lady that's shaped like my mother and I'm super shocked but something in me was also happy like it was like I needed it and didn't know I needed to see her I didn't know I I needed to see her so bad because I I was sick I was sick you guys and I didn't know how sick I was but I know I didn't know how to get out of it I didn't know how to get out of that grip and I was I was I was so gone and so wasted away with the alcohol and the drugs and and just everything you know so when I saw her it was like I I needed it so bad and um the the best part is she didn't judge me she didn't come and say what you doing here get out of here it was like she had she was so happy to see me I left that club I left out of there and we went back to the place I was staying at and she just loved on me and I needed it so much I didn't need nobody telling me how wrong I was I was already I knew I was messed up so sometime you don't even need somebody to tell you how messed up you were you just need that genuine unconditional love and that's what God put on her and um little by little we started hanging out more and more and um I started us my sister oldest sister told me about um signing up for school cuz I was still young she was like w you just go back to school you know go to this place called Jore so um I went ahead and signed up and I was you still kind of playing tug of war cuz you like you so caught up in this lifestyle but yet you know you got to get out you know you know you want to get out and uh they called me in three days and like look pack your stuff we got a ticket you getting out of here in 3 days and I signed up to go to Kentucky uh School in Kentucky that was my exit out of there and I never went back I end up getting married later not too long after that and everything that's another story but anyway my point is God used my mom like the prodical son and she didn't judge me man I tell her up to this day just thank you so much for just having that genuine love that I needed that unconditional love sometime that's all it take to kind of just break somebody because if she would have fussed and handle any kind of way I would have just rolled out and probably went somewhere else and got lost further deeper but um I just want to share that to you young people if you got a parent and a father that's together and they work on you guys trust me it's for your best best interest because sin will take you further than you want to go and cost you way more than you was willing to pay I promise you that amen what a wonderful what a wonderful testimony appreciate you sharing that sister rea appreciate Mama being there cuzz she's the reca wouldn't be here today if Mama wouldn't there she didn't act the way she did that day come on zo I learning that more and more every day that I that I go just you know just let God do the work you you can't be their Holy Spirit God's got to be their Holy Spirit and when God does the work he'll do it right come here yeah they can see you or you can stand right here in Nicaragua there was a city called Lon and basically basically over there um in Hispanic culture they like support like Gales ISM so there was a really big church and it was a Catholic church and um there were like so many statues there it was so big and then I asked my dad because he used to be a castol like what all those statues meant he explained to me them and then I'm and I'm like all of those statues they don't make sense it's like it's kind of like cutting off pieces of a puzzle just to force it to fit it in the like Masterpiece and I didn't understand no like what their like uh rituals were people were sitting there for hours praying I didn't know what they were saying it's like why are you doing doing this why yeah so then I keep walking around I keep looking at all these things and it was just so confusing but as soon as I walked out of that Catholic Church I felt a little more safe with my family and I'm actually happy to be here cuz I'm not being forced to Pray by the amount of time a candle will like light up and then melt down I feel Fe I feel really free to Pray by myself or with people praying praying were in praying in the right religion is a lot better than just being a Catholic now that I realize that religions are not just religions they they're just basically Babylon they just filled with confusion yeah yeah amen and there was um there was also another time in the island that we went to there was a church and I it was a really small church I was sitting there well I wasn't really exactly sitting in the church I was outside because it was really hot in the church so I was sitting over there and then there was a drunk man who walked like into the entrance of the church and then he was just sitting there putting his shoulder on the wall and I was really like I didn't know if I was angry or confused or annoyed why that he was there he he just like suddenly made me feel angry that he was just there so then my sister um told us to get back get back in um the what's it called Sanctuary Sanctuary yeah so then we went back to the sanctuary and then he so then we were just we were just done praying and then he walks in and he says in Spanish he says in Spanish hey you're mentioning mentioning about God and everything how Jesus the celestial father but then you're not mentioning about Holy Mary and I was I everyone there was confused and then the pastor was like oh it's because you're a Catholic right and then he was like no I'm not a Catholic I'm right so they kind of had to take him out of the church and I realized well Catholicism isn't really right and it's really confusing as well and it as confused as that he couldn't it add on to that he was drunk um it confused that drunk man to thinking that he was right so I'm really thankful to be in this church and to know that that everyone here believes on the right thing that's all I have to say well that's a miracle I the most I've ever heard her say anything since the time she was born let me just say this sometimes we get scared they're like oh we don't want our our kids to visit that church or Catholic church or go see let them go see let them go get an experience and then they'll come and appreciate what they have what they've grew up so I we didn't that's not what we were our plans but that's what she came out of that so amen keep that all right let's stand to our feet all M's clear let's sing Amazing Grace let's sing Amazing Grace before we go home and really mean it do
