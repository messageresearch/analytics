[13:49] in the Lord
[13:55] we're going to go ahead and go directly
[13:57] to the word
[14:01] you already know me my name is
[14:07] we're going to go directly to the word
[14:13] but before we do that let's let's have a
[14:15] word of prayer
[14:18] they would be the one to guide us this
[14:21] afternoon
[14:22] he would speak to our hearts
[14:25] let's pray
[14:30] Heavenly Father we're once again before
[14:32] your presence
[14:37] we ask you father
[14:39] Tom is to take control of us father
[14:45] take take every nervousness
[14:51] anything that would hinder
[14:56] Lord in your hands we commit ourselves
[15:00] come Lord Jesus
[15:02] to our hearts
[15:05] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[15:07] ask amen amen
[15:11] your Bibles this afternoon
[15:15] through the book of Hebrews
[15:19] El capitulo says Uno chapter 6 verse
[15:24] 1-6
[15:28] and this afternoon
[15:30] uh
[15:32] continue we're going to continue
[15:37] but our thought
[15:39] is
[15:41] seeking after after Perfection or
[15:44] seeking perfection
[15:50] the scripture in the name of the Lord
[15:52] Jesus
[15:53] Christo
[15:59] Perfection
[16:08] therefore leaving the principles of the
[16:10] doctrine of Christ let us go unto
[16:12] Perfection not laying again the
[16:15] foundation of repentance from that works
[16:18] and of Faith toward God
[16:20] foreign
[16:29] of the doctrine of baptisms and of
[16:32] laying on hand of hands and of
[16:34] resurrection of the dead end of Eternal
[16:36] judgment yes
[16:41] and this we will do if God permit
[16:43] celestial
[16:53] for it's impossible for those who were
[16:56] once enlightened and have tasted of the
[16:58] Heavenly gift and were made partakers of
[17:01] the Holy Ghost
[17:02] s
[17:08] and have tasted the good word of God and
[17:11] the powers of the world to come
[17:13] is
[17:23] if they shall fall away to renew them
[17:26] again unto repentance seeing They
[17:28] Crucified to themselves the Son of God
[17:30] afresh and put him to an open shame
[17:33] foreign
[17:38] Matthew chapter 5 verse 48.
[17:44] said was
[17:50] Perfecto be perfect as your father in
[17:53] Heaven which is in heaven is perfect
[17:59] you may be seated
[18:07] remember we're seeking after perfection
[18:14] as we seek perfection
[18:19] our father he's perfect
[18:24] our heavenly father is perfect
[18:28] and if we're seeking after Perfection or
[18:31] if we're seeing the perfection
[18:35] and we are going to be perfect
[18:40] because nothing of this Earth
[18:44] will come into the kingdom of God
[18:48] sin without
[18:50] said a perfect being perfect
[18:54] Oria so our trajectory here on Earth is
[19:00] our journey here on Earth is
[19:04] towards perfection
[19:08] I'm not perfect and you're not perfect
[19:13] but brother Brandon says that this body
[19:17] is sin
[19:23] how can that be yeah
[19:27] this is flesh
[19:30] and this flesh is
[19:34] rotten
[19:39] it's a little tough to think about
[19:45] because we we bathe
[19:48] we change our clothes
[19:52] maybe we put a little bit of a lotion a
[19:54] little bit of a cologne to smell a
[19:56] little better but even then yes
[20:00] you're still rotting
[20:05] because sin is something ugly
[20:10] something that we really don't want
[20:14] because we don't really want it
[20:19] you get angry and audio you you get
[20:23] upset
[20:26] because you keep walking
[20:29] you're not perfect
[20:32] but when all the things of this Earth
[20:34] this life
[20:37] leave this body
[20:41] Perfection then you will come to
[20:43] Perfection
[20:47] you're walking us you have problems you
[20:52] have struggles you have sicknesses
[20:56] anything will try to trot us down
[21:01] but we're going to a place
[21:05] and that place is perfection
[21:09] we are citizens
[21:14] and I was talking to brother Louise okay
[21:20] I don't worry about the citizenship of
[21:24] this Earth
[21:28] that's not really a big concern to me
[21:32] because the city that I'm going to
[21:36] man
[21:51] that's where I'll find perfection then
[21:54] amen amen
[21:59] says
[22:01] Hebrews chapter 6 part 2.
[22:05] this is
[22:12] okay
[22:17] now we got that this morning how that we
[22:21] are perfected Perfection
[22:24] perfected absolutely
[22:26] spotless
[22:28] and blameless
[22:32] not one sin on us
[22:37] and he asks a question is
[22:42] are you above temptation
[22:46] says never
[22:49] do you sin every day
[22:53] says yes sir
[22:59] but yet we are perfected because we are
[23:03] in him
[23:05] and God could not no more
[23:08] than nothing
[23:11] couldn't be righteous
[23:14] he's already judged Us in him
[23:18] when he judged Christ
[23:21] he judged me
[23:24] he judged you you know he can't judge me
[23:29] again
[23:30] because he took my judgment
[23:34] if I've been redeemed do you notice
[23:38] that's the key right there
[23:40] if you've been reading
[23:47] because you're in him
[23:49] but if you're not in here
[23:52] then who is going to judge you
[23:56] who is going to judge you
[24:01] it's tremendous thing to think about
[24:06] so if we have received the knowledge of
[24:10] the truth who is the truth Jesus Jesus
[24:13] is the truth the Lord amen amen
[24:18] when we have received the knowledge of
[24:21] the truth
[24:21] you can have it
[24:24] as we said this morning
[24:26] had the knowledge of the truth
[24:29] he knew the truth
[24:35] the word was made flesh
[24:38] so he had knowledge
[24:41] he knew who Jesus was
[24:43] he knew that he could raise the dead
[24:47] he knew that he could raise the the
[24:49] world
[24:51] he had knowledge
[24:53] but he didn't have it is
[24:58] one thing to know
[25:35] to look
[25:42] but he doesn't have it
[25:45] when you really have it
[25:47] you will realize that you've been
[25:50] redeemed
[25:54] because he already judged him you in him
[25:58] amen
[25:59] previously
[26:07] Dem Pena
[26:09] he says here uh
[26:13] and I got a ticket to show that I've
[26:16] redeemed my watch from the pawn shop
[26:21] let somebody try to take it back in the
[26:24] pawn shops
[26:27] I've got a ticket
[26:30] I have redeemed it
[26:33] is
[26:38] and if the devil would try to put
[26:41] punishment on me
[26:42] I've got a ticket
[26:46] that shows I have been redeemed yes sir
[26:52] no more judgment
[26:56] s
[26:59] Hearth my words and believeth on him
[27:02] that sent me
[27:04] Eterna has eternal life
[27:06] you shall never come to the judge but
[27:10] has passed
[27:15] that's my ticket he gave the promise
[27:20] la
[27:22] Perfection so following or seeking
[27:25] Perfection
[27:29] as my father is perfect
[27:33] so if the father is perfect
[27:35] the children are perfect when
[27:41] are they perfected
[27:46] there's a lovely thing right there
[27:50] when is something perfect
[27:54] emotional commodes
[27:58] we were in the in the pawn shop and amen
[28:05] who takes you out of the pawn shop
[28:08] the one that has money
[28:11] who has the money
[28:17] some of us we fell backers
[28:22] if no one can take us out of the pawn
[28:24] shop
[28:34] gonna die there
[28:36] is
[28:38] just like a saying that I know
[28:42] where are there any Catholics here or
[28:44] were there any Catholics here okay
[28:50] I wasn't a Catholic but
[28:54] my parents were Seventh-Day Adventists
[29:01] and they say that whatever their parents
[29:04] said that's what that's how it is
[29:06] the Catholics believe the same thing
[29:10] if their parents were catholic
[29:13] I'm gonna die okay
[29:15] they're in the pawn shop then
[29:20] we don't have it so easy
[29:24] the scripture teaches
[29:28] he said many are called
[29:31] a few are chosen foreign
[29:54] I believe in jumping
[29:57] but none of that will benefit
[30:00] what will benefit us
[30:06] is that we have been born again
[30:10] and so there is
[30:19] no more judgment for you
[30:23] that's a good thing to think about
[30:29] it
[30:32] so this morning we were talking about
[30:35] this Young Rich ruler is
[30:38] and brother Branham says
[30:41] okay
[30:49] he's the one that died alongside Lazarus
[30:55] now when this young man
[31:00] rejected eternal life
[31:05] I asked you a question this afternoon
[31:09] did he have a good rest of his life or
[31:12] or his life just went to ruins after
[31:14] that
[31:17] he had his granaries
[31:22] he he he set him up
[31:24] and he made him bigger
[31:30] he got richer see yeah and Don says
[31:35] so we're here mirando uh
[31:38] looking all around us
[31:42] how people around us progress in life
[31:47] and there's nothing against that is the
[31:50] problem
[31:50] nothing against rich people know
[31:55] the Bible tells us clearly that how
[31:58] tough is for a rich person to get into
[32:00] the kingdom
[32:33] you don't want to have it and just keep
[32:36] it all to yourself
[32:46] he was self-centered
[32:50] he was he was self-centered uh
[32:58] there was a high category that he was in
[33:05] that he didn't want to get around the
[33:08] ones that wanted to be around Jesus
[33:12] because the followers of Jesus
[33:15] were the were the ones of the low class
[33:19] not even middle class ones
[34:01] over there
[35:00] tell him
[35:14] that's what happened on the day of
[35:16] Pentecost
[35:18] the days that they were there together
[35:21] foreign
[35:28] when they went in
[35:54] within those days that they were in
[35:56] there
[35:59] some of them had to fix their
[36:01] differences
[36:04] and God will not take us
[36:08] if we start fixing our own differences
[36:11] with each other yes sir
[36:14] that is the truth
[36:20] I have to go to him
[36:24] with my heart
[36:28] forgive me I spoke bad about you I
[36:32] expressed myself in a wrong way I ask
[36:36] you to to help me I want to go in
[36:39] to go to the kingdom of God I don't want
[36:43] to stay here
[36:46] clean yes
[36:51] nothing there will be there unless
[36:53] there's Divine love
[36:55] God help us
[37:00] each and every one of us need that
[37:03] little part yes
[37:05] and that little part that we need is
[37:07] humility
[37:09] we need humility
[37:12] in our hearts yes amen
[37:17] Lord Jesus Christ
[37:21] these words will help you this afternoon
[37:24] you're helping me
[37:27] amen
[37:28] there you go
[37:34] bendito is the name of our Lord Jesus
[37:38] Christ
[37:46] and the message that we were reading
[37:51] follow me
[37:53] come follow me
[38:03] paragraph 47
[38:09] Lombre
[38:10] and what we were talking about man is
[38:16] also for the ghost for the woman Ben see
[38:23] because we are talking about human life
[38:28] human Souls just as for men and women
[38:36] and after all these opportunities that
[38:38] the young man had amen see
[38:41] [Applause]
[38:45] he says here that see he become on Easy
[38:48] Street
[38:52] how much money he had
[38:57] explained this he probably partied with
[39:00] splendor
[39:02] explain this
[39:06] do you understand the word splendor
[39:10] yeah
[39:14] it's not he wasn't walking like the way
[39:17] we Hispanics say he wasn't walking with
[39:19] just any any sort of thing
[39:21] he knew how to he knew he had an answer
[39:24] for things
[39:27] he could do it he had a way
[39:32] he could he could he could uh he could
[39:34] uh he could he had a way to make it
[39:39] he wasn't poor
[39:42] mucho right
[39:51] we call it on a place where he didn't
[39:53] have to worry about too much
[39:56] again
[40:01] he came to be a governor a ruler La
[40:05] Biblia the Bible
[40:11] refers to here of the as the Young Rich
[40:14] Young Ruler evemos
[40:17] El
[40:19] Prana and we see at a young age
[40:23] maybe in his teenage
[40:28] just out of school
[40:31] just out of graduation
[40:35] maybe a few weeks before
[40:46] he had all that Hearts could desire
[40:51] what a tremendous thing
[40:53] is
[40:56] no modern Ricky
[40:58] yeah
[40:59] he's a fine kid
[41:01] cuando Lucas
[41:04] I believe when Luke wrote about it
[41:08] Jesus I believe it was Jesus
[41:11] at him inside
[41:13] because he loved him
[41:18] and I was I was looking through the
[41:20] scriptures
[41:23] and it's only in Matthew Marcos and in
[41:26] Mark Lucas and then Luke
[41:28] where they wrote about this
[41:32] and I was looking
[41:34] there is only three places where he
[41:37] talks about this
[41:40] and the Bible says that where there's
[41:42] two or three in minumbre gathered
[41:44] together that's where I'll be
[41:51] and the word of God tells us that in the
[41:54] mouth of two or three Witnesses
[41:57] let every word be established amen amen
[42:02] Mateo Matthew uh
[42:07] he he he he came to know those
[42:10] scriptures
[42:12] and when he went to the mountain he
[42:15] might have taken he took he took
[42:18] see when Jesus went up to the mountain
[42:21] he took Peter he took John yeah
[42:26] James
[42:28] why didn't he take the rest of them he
[42:30] only took three
[42:34] have you ever asked why yeah
[42:38] because faith is
[42:42] there was love there is
[42:44] there was hope there as well
[42:51] let every word be established
[42:53] every business dealing
[42:59] God had his three Witnesses up above you
[43:03] know that
[43:06] you probably know better than I do
[43:09] ahora now figures
[43:16] Jesus
[43:18] and so he says that Jesus looked at him
[43:21] and said and loved him Ben
[43:26] there's something about the kid
[43:31] there was a nice personality hooked with
[43:34] this kid
[43:36] who worked with this kid
[43:46] who had taught him the Commandments of
[43:48] God
[43:51] and seeing that he kept him and he did
[43:55] it from his youth up
[43:58] and
[44:01] the boy had an ambition
[44:08] as young as young people
[44:11] as young people
[44:14] as young
[44:17] esposa we want to have a good wife
[44:21] you know what the Bible says
[44:24] a good wife
[44:27] will edify his her house

[47:52] oh no oh
[47:56] it don't always have to be wealth
[48:01] it could be popularity
[48:04] some pretty girl yes
[48:09] she's got her beauty that she can think
[48:12] of
[48:15] maybe she's very popular in school
[48:21] maybe the boy can get any girl he wants
[48:25] he feels that he's kind of secured
[48:29] that's not security
[48:32] that'll fade just like the flowers
[48:43] just a few turns of sun
[48:46] that's gone
[48:48] then you've got a soul
[48:52] that has to live eternally
[49:23] what was the last plague that they had
[49:25] there death
[49:38] then die
[49:41] physically he didn't die but
[49:45] spiritually
[49:47] and so everything starts with the
[49:50] beginning amen amen
[49:52] he started at the beginning spiritually
[49:55] physical physically yes spiritual and
[49:58] then spiritual
[50:00] three things brothers
[50:02] so what are we gonna do
[50:05] to follow the Perfection seek after
[50:09] Perfection

[50:19] sure
[50:21] God's gonna have to do something with
[50:24] you
[50:26] have you ever have you ever thought
[50:28] about
[50:29] many people
[50:32] leave this earth
[50:35] and and we we're we're sad about it
[50:39] and you ask yourself why why did they
[50:42] have to leave
[50:44] if you know what the plan of God is or
[50:47] if you know about God's plan
[50:50] here on this Earth
[50:52] in the natural life
[50:55] we have a destiny bien Mercado a very
[50:58] marked Destiny
[51:00] When God Says up to here and that's it
[51:25] let's read
[51:31] encontra
[51:32] and we're gonna see
[51:36] foreign
[51:41] where he found himself
[51:47] Lucas Lucas Luke 16.
[51:57] Lucas yes he says Luke 16 verse 19.
[52:05] we're going to see where this young man
[52:08] ended up after rejecting the Lord Jesus
[52:15] there was a certain rich man which was
[52:17] clothed in purple and fine linen yes
[52:23] and fared sumptuously every day so vegan
[52:27] you see Khan explained this sumptuously
[52:32] um
[52:38] and there was a certain beggar named
[52:41] Lazarus which was laid at the his gate
[52:43] full of sores
[52:51] to be fed with the crumbs which fell
[52:54] from the rich man's table Yeah
[52:58] moreover the dogs came and licked source
[53:05] Los Angeles
[53:07] and he came to pass that the beggar died
[53:10] and was carried by the Angels into
[53:12] Abraham's
[53:15] bosomes also died and was buried
[53:28] Abraham afar off
[53:31] Anton says and Lazarus in his bosom
[53:33] es
[53:37] and he cried and said Father Abraham
[53:40] have mercy on me
[53:45] and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip
[53:48] of his finger in water
[53:50] and cool my tongue
[53:54] I am tormented in this Flame
[54:01] this is real yes
[54:07] now you paint this picture
[54:11] and I believe as brothers says we all
[54:14] fail
[54:15] but when you fail
[54:18] you make it right
[54:20] that's why we have this message
[54:24] [Applause]
[54:27] to to find out about where we're wrong
[54:30] in our lives
[54:32] now many times
[54:36] he makes us to fear yes
[54:42] and he's the one who uh who who puts it
[54:45] in us to to to to follow
[54:48] many times I've said
[54:53] the devil puts someone in jail come on
[54:58] he puts them in jail
[55:01] but he's not the one who's going to take
[55:04] you out he can't take you out
[55:07] he can't take you out all right
[55:09] now I I tell you
[55:13] if the devil puts you in jail
[55:18] will the devil take you out no El Diablo
[55:23] the devil wants you to just get deeper
[55:25] in that cell
[55:31] that we look like this young man
[55:36] that rejected the truth rejected
[55:41] eternal life
[55:43] he found himself
[55:47] found himself screaming yes
[55:52] now you make an example
[55:55] you take a a glass full of water
[56:02] just put your just barely dip your
[56:04] finger
[56:06] conformist and as you dip it and you
[56:10] take it out you see how the water will
[56:14] drip yeah
[56:16] he didn't have water yes
[56:20] but that's what he desired okay
[56:24] would go there and to refresh his tongue
[56:37] the child of God isn't isn't conformed
[56:40] or isn't satisfied with just get it the
[56:44] Son of God wants more okay
[56:47] he wants more of God this young man he
[56:52] wanted more money more riches the Son of
[56:56] God once more of God
[57:00] so that he can be perfect convinced
[57:14] it's kind of difficult to convince
[57:16] ourselves
[57:18] and uh speaking about our young people
[57:24] how is a young man going to convince the
[57:27] one that he likes
[57:30] giving her the rules from the beginning
[57:32] of what he that wants in his home
[57:35] is
[57:36] that the way he's gonna make her fall in
[57:38] love with him no no but no she's going
[57:44] to say that no forget it I don't want
[57:45] none of this
[57:48] but if the young man he's tender yes
[57:51] chocolates
[58:04] with that that might help
[58:09] let me give you a a word of advice and I
[58:13] was talking to the brother
[58:15] brother Zach okay okay no no no no no
[58:18] papa oh brother Bob okay okay
[58:21] and I was telling the brother and I said
[58:24] look brother
[58:25] el hombre
[58:27] the man and the woman
[58:31] they always listen
[58:33] through here
[58:35] but you know what
[58:38] the serpent is
[58:41] where he went to go talk to Eve
[58:45] but the Son and Daughter of God
[58:48] they have to see
[58:51] with the eye of their heart
[58:54] they have to here
[58:59] with the ear of their heart this is
[59:05] my heart have an ear or see yes
[59:12] does my heart have an eye see yes
[59:18] because you as a Christian
[59:23] I tell you you don't have a bad name no
[59:26] no
[59:26] um oh you don't have a bad man
[59:32] you don't want a bad man in your life or
[59:34] a bad husband
[59:37] but you want a good husband
[59:41] that helps you that takes care of you
[59:46] that does good things for you
[59:51] because what what is it worth it you're
[59:53] in the house yes
[59:56] you play your role as mother as as as as
[1:00:00] wife
[1:00:03] and many make the mistake
[1:00:07] they say well if I get married
[1:00:10] I'm not going to have to do so much work
[1:00:13] and they get a man that puts them to
[1:00:16] work yes
[1:00:23] because that man he's lazy he doesn't
[1:00:27] want to work
[1:00:29] he wants to live in misery
[1:00:32] because he says he says that the poor
[1:00:36] shall inherit the kingdom of God
[1:00:38] but it doesn't work that way no no
[1:00:43] thank you
[1:00:45] [Laughter]
