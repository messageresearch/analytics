[43:45] just part of the worship lord it's a
[43:47] continuation now god i pray that you'd
[43:49] come and take your word lord and may it
[43:52] divide us under both body soul and

[43:57] emotions beyond our intellectual realm
[43:59] where we can reason and understand and
[44:01] rationalize lord let your word this
[44:03] morning move beyond that realm
[44:06] may it contact that realm lord where
[44:08] there's real faith
[44:09] lord to accept it so that it can produce
[44:12] what you've intended for it to produce
[44:14] in our life
[44:15] lord we ask for each need that's been
[44:17] raised before you i raise both my hands
[44:19] up lord with everyone here this morning
[44:22] asking god for your grace and your mercy
[44:23] lord to be a need meter lord i pray
[44:26] bless this church father as they
[44:28] continue to be a lighthouse lord in this
[44:30] part of your country lord in this nation
[44:33] lord we need churches that are alive

[44:38] you can come and dwell and tabernacle

[44:56] as we've just gathered here to hear from
[44:58] you now i pray god you'd come and speak
[45:00] to us lord we pray in jesus name
[45:03] amen you can be seated
[45:06] it's amazing when you read brother
[45:08] branham's sermons the series that he
[45:10] takes on just once more lord and he uses
[45:13] samson and the story of samson that we
[45:15] spoke on last night and we talked a lot
[45:18] about his life and the the condition of
[45:20] the choices that he had made for those
[45:22] of you that weren't here we went through
[45:24] some parts of his story there that we
[45:27] find in the book of judges and we showed
[45:29] how that his decisions and choices had
[45:32] led him to a condition where he's blind
[45:35] and he can't see and his eyes are put
[45:37] out and he's bound with fetters of brass
[45:39] and and he's being led by a child and
[45:42] now he's the scorn in the mockery of the
[45:45] philistines
[45:46] and it's incredible because the very
[45:48] thing that god anointed him and ordained
[45:50] him to destroy was now
[45:53] now he was held captive to and he had
[45:55] been
[45:56] completely destroyed by
[45:59] it's incredible though when you sort of
[46:01] take that and you put the lens of
[46:03] of the message on it and brother brandon
[46:05] preaches that from the perspective of
[46:07] samson being a type of the modern church
[46:10] and he speaks about how that blindness
[46:12] that had came upon samson had came upon
[46:15] the church world
[46:17] and how that we said last night that
[46:19] samson was blind long before they put
[46:21] his eyes out uh his decisions that he
[46:24] had made you could tell that he had no
[46:26] spiritual he'd lost all spiritual
[46:28] discernment he not only forgot who god
[46:30] was but he forgot who he was he forgot
[46:33] his place in the word and what his
[46:35] purpose was to serve
[46:37] and the prophet of god begins to say
[46:39] that these just like the modern church
[46:41] today
[46:42] uh that that once stood in its glory and
[46:45] was commissioned to be a lighthouse and
[46:48] it was commissioned to uh to to destroy
[46:50] the kingdom of the enemy but now brother
[46:53] branham says now that church is laying
[46:55] the lap of delilah has flirted with with
[46:58] sin and and and she stands there blind
[47:01] and she's lost her eyesight and we know
[47:04] that eyesight is a type of a prophet an
[47:06] eyesight is that the
[47:08] seven eyes of god in the book of
[47:09] revelations that go to and fro uh in the
[47:12] entire earth uh is a is a is a as an
[47:16] exact meaning of what a prophet
[47:19] messenger brings it brings eyesight so
[47:21] that you can look at the same things
[47:23] that churches have looked at for uh
[47:25] hundreds of years and you you you look
[47:28] at the same book and the same words and
[47:30] the same bible that they look at but you
[47:32] have prophetic vision and you can look
[47:35] beyond what the paper what the ink on
[47:37] the paper says and you understand the
[47:39] mind of the writer and you understand
[47:41] the spirit of the author uh that's why
[47:44] this message is not just letter it's not
[47:46] intellect and it's not just
[47:48] it didn't come just to give us greater
[47:50] understanding or theology than the
[47:52] baptist church it didn't come to give us
[47:54] greater understanding of the mysteries
[47:56] we know the mysteries we understand the
[47:57] mysteries thank god
[48:00] thank the lord for eyesight in this
[48:02] generation thank god i know what the who
[48:04] the beast is thank god i know who the
[48:06] false prophet is thank the lord i'm not
[48:08] deceived and i'm not going to be a
[48:10] deceived church by the world thank god i
[48:12] know what happened in the in the
[48:14] beginning that it wasn't an apple that
[48:16] evade thank god i know who the white
[48:18] horse writer that it wasn't christ
[48:20] thank the lord for the mysteries that
[48:22] god has revealed but let me just stop
[48:23] and say for a minute the the the
[48:26] understanding of the mysteries was not
[48:28] the purpose or the intent of god sending
[48:30] a message
[48:31] but brother burnham says that it would
[48:33] be those divinely revealed truths that
[48:36] would literally turn the hearts of the
[48:38] children
[48:40] back to the faith of the pentecostal
[48:42] fathers not welch and not daddy seymour
[48:45] not azusa street
[48:46] not 1907 but 1906 but uh but but the
[48:50] first church
[48:52] after the bible says as peter gave the
[48:54] inaugural message repent and be baptized
[48:56] in the name of the lord jesus christ and
[48:58] you shall receive the gift of the holy
[49:00] ghost the prophet says that's the
[49:02] original message that's what we're
[49:04] fighting for
[49:06] but samson had had had lost his eyesight
[49:09] and the prophet says very much like that
[49:11] the church is now on the lap of delilah
[49:14] and he says she's lost her vision she's
[49:16] bound by fetters of brass
[49:20] isaiah chapter 52 just hold your place
[49:23] there it's incredible because very much
[49:25] like this daughter of zionist speaking
[49:27] of literal a literal israel and
[49:30] and literally it speaks of israel not
[49:32] just past but present and future
[49:35] and what god's going to do
[49:37] but it also zion speaks of also not just
[49:40] natural but spiritual israel the church
[49:44] and we believe that we are
[49:45] that spiritual church
[49:48] you believe that this morning
[49:51] i want you to notice some of the words
[49:52] here and just read it with me in isaiah
[49:54] chapter 52 as a minister and on the
[49:56] captive daughter of zion
[49:58] let's just read here in isaiah 52 and
[50:00] let's start at verse 1
[50:02] awake
[50:03] awake
[50:05] he repeats this here
[50:07] put on thy strength o zion
[50:10] put on your beautiful garments o
[50:13] jerusalem the holy city
[50:15] father you're uncircumcised and unclean
[50:16] shall no longer come to you shake
[50:18] yourself
[50:20] so here's what isaiah begins to say is
[50:22] this
[50:23] is this this this sad condition
[50:26] that she finds herself in of what the
[50:28] church had become and you can type this
[50:30] to the life of a believer you can type
[50:33] it to an individual you could type it to
[50:35] the nation of israel
[50:37] but notice here that it's the daughter
[50:39] of zion who was
[50:41] once
[50:42] a pure
[50:44] beautiful
[50:45] woman
[50:47] she wasn't defiled she wasn't she wasn't
[50:50] uh polluted but she was
[50:53] she she was a pure
[50:55] daughter of zion who gave birth to sons
[50:58] and and now she's laying like a slave
[51:02] she's laying like a slave
[51:04] bound
[51:07] you know that you can become a slave
[51:08] after you can become bound
[51:12] after christ sets you free
[51:14] what did paul say and i think it's in
[51:16] galatians 5 when he says stand fast in
[51:19] the liberty wherewith christ has made
[51:21] you free
[51:22] and be not entangled again
[51:25] with the yoke of bondage
[51:28] you see it's never the lord that rebinds
[51:30] you and puts change but we are quick to
[51:32] find the change that god has set us free
[51:34] from in our life
[51:36] and just like that this daughter that
[51:38] was once free and once clean and once
[51:40] beautiful and now she's laying in the
[51:42] dust
[51:43] she's groveling in the dirt like a slave
[51:46] and she's she's filthy her garment is
[51:50] not a beautiful garment now it's torn
[51:52] and she's she's she's laying there in
[51:54] the dust and and and she's she's
[51:56] clutching and howling and
[51:58] and and she's praying for for
[52:00] deliverance she's praying for freedom
[52:02] she's praying that god would come and
[52:05] change her circumstances
[52:10] and the bible says she's got a chain
[52:12] around her neck
[52:14] and she's clutching at this chain that's
[52:16] choking her and she wants free and she
[52:19] doesn't want to die like this in a
[52:20] sleigh as a slave and and and bound and
[52:24] and she's she's in isaiah 51 18 the
[52:27] bible speaks of this that she wants to
[52:29] be free she doesn't want to die that way
[52:32] and now even worse her enemies the
[52:34] philistines are mocking her and laughing
[52:38] at her and blaspheming
[52:40] jehovah
[52:42] taunting her that god had no power to
[52:44] set her free
[52:47] and so now now what happens for her is
[52:50] that now she's the bible says she's
[52:52] fainted she's
[52:53] she's collapsed she's laying there and
[52:56] and she's in this terrible condition
[52:58] let's just pick it up here in isaiah 52
[53:01] and let's read it here in verse
[53:03] 2 shake thyself from the dust
[53:06] arise and sit down o jerusalem
[53:09] loose thyself from the bands of thy neck
[53:12] o captive daughter of zion for thus
[53:15] saith the lord you have
[53:18] sold
[53:19] yourself
[53:22] you cannot sell god cannot sell what he
[53:25] has purchased but you can sell
[53:27] self
[53:29] and some people sell themselves to a
[53:31] career and that's all that inundates
[53:33] them and that intoxicates them like a
[53:35] drug
[53:36] alcohol does the same thing but i'm
[53:38] going to tell you money has the same
[53:39] power that alcohol does and they become
[53:42] chasing a dream chasing a a trace
[53:45] chasing a story chasing the hype
[53:49] but as we spoke on last night you have a
[53:51] vision that you have an ambitions that
[53:53] you have in dreams that you have but
[53:55] then there's the blueprints that god has
[53:56] already drawn before you ever step foot
[53:58] on the earth
[54:00] and your life will be made up of the
[54:02] struggle
[54:04] between self-will
[54:07] of wanting what you want and chasing
[54:09] what you want and then surrendering to
[54:12] what the lord really wants
[54:14] and some people have given up that
[54:16] struggle a long time ago
[54:18] others are still fighting that same
[54:20] battle and that same struggle
[54:22] and it's incredible because you see here
[54:24] this condition she's in
[54:26] but i want you to notice here as the
[54:28] bible says you've sown yourself
[54:31] you've sown yourself for nothing no no
[54:34] no this didn't just happen to you in
[54:36] other words this isn't this isn't like
[54:38] joseph where he's tricked by his
[54:40] brothers and he's sold into slavery
[54:44] this isn't this isn't like uh you know a
[54:46] man who's been entrapped by the devil
[54:48] and and he's just fallen into bad
[54:50] circumstances but
[54:52] the but the the isaiah makes it clear he
[54:54] says no this is you've done this
[54:56] yourself you've given yourself to this
[55:00] you've given yourself you've became a
[55:02] slave
[55:03] uh you've now you now you're now you're
[55:05] laying there and you're you're groveling
[55:07] in the dirt
[55:08] you've sold yourself for not verse three
[55:11] says which means nothing you've sown
[55:13] yourself for nothing
[55:15] and so you see here what is what is
[55:16] isaiah really speaking about here and i
[55:18] want you to notice this because
[55:20] to me it's so powerful what the lord uh
[55:23] says to her as as we go through some of
[55:26] this i just want you to
[55:27] listen as i'm as i'm gonna quote you
[55:29] some scriptures you could turn there in
[55:31] isaiah 49 actually let's let's turn
[55:33] there as isaiah 49 and we'll just read a
[55:36] very familiar verse in chapter 49
[55:40] verse 14
[55:41] of isaiah
[55:43] notice he says awake awake put on your
[55:45] strength now
[55:47] these are the loving words of a heavenly
[55:50] father i want you to remember something
[55:52] as you read this
[55:53] this is not the daughter of jezebel
[55:58] this is the daughter of zion
[56:02] and now you have not this not you don't
[56:04] now you have here the kind words
[56:07] of how the father speaks to his daughter
[56:10] and he says awake put on your strength
[56:14] awake
[56:15] awake she's laying there she's in the
[56:18] dust she's groveling she doesn't know
[56:20] she's there and the and the bible says
[56:22] she's laying there clutching this chain
[56:24] and here's the words of the lord awake
[56:27] in other words wake up
[56:29] wake up child wake up wake up i i gotta
[56:33] get you to wake up right now
[56:35] you gotta you gotta wake up
[56:37] awake shake yourself this is what the
[56:39] lord does through the preaching of the
[56:40] word because god knows whether you know
[56:43] what's inside of you god knows what he
[56:45] put there and you may feel like you're a
[56:47] million miles from the lord this morning
[56:49] but god knows the seed he put inside of
[56:51] there and so what does he do he doesn't
[56:53] speak to your failures and your faults
[56:55] and your mistakes he speaks to the seed
[56:57] that's laying down inside of you because
[56:59] the potential is inside of the seed and
[57:02] so the word the preaching of the word
[57:03] comes and it starts to say wake up wake
[57:06] up you're not a child of the devil
[57:08] you're a child of god wake up don't be a
[57:10] slave you god has set you free and so
[57:13] god comes with encouragement he's
[57:15] speaking to the potential down inside of
[57:17] that girl
[57:19] and he says wake up put on your strength
[57:22] there's no rebuke
[57:24] now she sold herself she's enslaved she
[57:27] sold herself to this but you notice
[57:29] there's no rebuke from the lord
[57:32] i love this so much because it tells you
[57:34] so much about your heavenly
[57:38] father awake put on your strength
[57:42] no rebuke
[57:44] and there's also no retraction of
[57:47] promises there's no well the object is
[57:49] going to give up on you and you've just
[57:51] you've sinned it away and i'm just going
[57:52] to find someone else there's no no the
[57:53] lord's still there
[57:55] his mercy is still there
[57:58] he's not forgotten you know one thing
[58:00] people might abandon you but the lord
[58:02] will never abandon you
[58:06] never abandon you
[58:10] i want to take that thought just here
[58:11] for a moment notice isaiah chapter 49
[58:13] verse 14 very familiar let's read it can
[58:15] a woman
[58:16] forget her suckling child
[58:19] isaiah 49 verse 14 that she should not
[58:22] have compassion on the son of her womb
[58:25] yay yes
[58:27] can a woman
[58:28] you say my goodness can a woman forget
[58:33] yeah mother can forget thank god for
[58:36] good mothers thank god for loving
[58:38] mothers
[58:39] but a mother a human mother in bad
[58:41] circumstance wrong circumstance gibbs
[58:43] could give up that child
[58:46] can a woman forget this is jehovah
[58:48] speaking and he says yeah
[58:51] they may forget
[58:52] yet
[58:53] will i not forget thee
[58:57] behold
[58:59] i have graven thee
[59:00] upon the palms of my hands
[59:04] and he says thy walls are continually
[59:08] before me
[59:09] this is the lord speaking here they may
[59:11] forget i'll never forget and he says
[59:13] behold i've graven you on the palm of my
[59:15] hands
[59:16] thy walls are continually
[59:20] before me
[59:22] it's amazing how quickly we isolate
[59:24] ourselves through besetting sins or sins
[59:26] in our life and we isolate ourselves
[59:28] from the family of god from the house of
[59:30] god from the lord himself
[59:33] and god god says they're so amazing
[59:35] because he says he says he says thy
[59:38] walls are continually
[59:41] before me thy walls this word in the
[59:43] hebrew is
[59:45] the word shoma and i wish i had it for
[59:47] the screen to show you the meaning
[59:49] of what this word
[59:51] it literally means when he says thy
[59:53] walls
[59:54] are continually before me it means to be
[59:58] joined
[59:59] to a wall to be joined
[1:00:02] to a wall
[1:00:04] like a brick mason would lay a wall
[1:00:06] a block mason would lay a wall and he
[1:00:08] takes one block and then he lays it on
[1:00:10] another and puts grout over that and
[1:00:12] then he lays that and puts grout over
[1:00:14] then he lays another and it's the blocks
[1:00:15] are interlocking one block on the other
[1:00:18] upon the other upon the other upon the
[1:00:20] other and god is saying this is how this
[1:00:23] is how this is how joined how
[1:00:25] intricately intricately woven i am into
[1:00:29] the fabric of your heart
[1:00:32] thy walls are continually before me like
[1:00:35] being joined to a wall
[1:00:37] what wall is he speaking of a prison
[1:00:40] wall
[1:00:41] you see you see that when the lord of
[1:00:43] what the lord is saying is that when
[1:00:44] you're bound i'm bound
[1:00:46] when you're hurt i'm hurt when you're
[1:00:48] sick i'm sick let me give you the words
[1:00:50] of new testament language he's a high
[1:00:53] priest who can be touched by the
[1:00:56] feelings
[1:00:57] of your infirmities
[1:01:02] thy walls are continually god is telling
[1:01:05] this is what this is what the lord said
[1:01:06] it's going to become so important in a
[1:01:08] minute
[1:01:08] when you realize
[1:01:10] the covenant or the promise that god
[1:01:12] gives his children
[1:01:14] he can be touched by the feelings of
[1:01:17] your infirmities
[1:01:21] i want you to look at the life of this
[1:01:22] man as we turn a corner here in genesis
[1:01:24] 28
[1:01:25] turn quickly there to genesis 28 look at
[1:01:28] this man
[1:01:29] jacob you love him
[1:01:31] don't you love his word
[1:01:35] it's real it's real to me
[1:01:38] my goodness
[1:01:42] genesis chapter 28 and i just want you
[1:01:44] to look and i'm going to just be
[1:01:46] choosing what i read and what i skip
[1:01:48] just to save time
[1:01:49] but i want you to notice here the life
[1:01:51] of this man as we just read here in
[1:01:52] isaiah god is saying i can't forget you
[1:01:55] and and your walls are continually
[1:01:57] before me and
[1:01:58] and and and and we we realize that means

[1:02:06] woven in your walls are always before me
[1:02:09] i can't forget that's why god says i
[1:02:11] can't forget you i'll never forget you
[1:02:15] and notice this man jacob here as we
[1:02:18] look at his life just for a moment we
[1:02:20] spoke about samson now let's look at
[1:02:22] another character here and i want you
[1:02:23] just to begin reading at verse 15.
[1:02:26] he says here in verse 15 actually let's
[1:02:29] back up from there let me just make sure
[1:02:30] i find my make sure i'm catching the
[1:02:32] right thing here
[1:02:34] as the bible says here and god gives him
[1:02:36] a promise let's read this promise
[1:02:38] uh first let's start with verse 11. and
[1:02:41] he lighted upon a certain place and
[1:02:43] teared there all night because the sun
[1:02:45] was set and he took off the st took off
[1:02:47] of the stones of that place and put them
[1:02:49] for his pillows and laid down in his
[1:02:51] place to sleep in that place to sleep
[1:02:54] and he dreamed
[1:02:55] and behold a ladder set upon the earth
[1:02:58] and the top of it reached to heaven and
[1:03:00] behold the angels of god ascending and
[1:03:02] descending
[1:03:03] on it and behold the lord stood above it
[1:03:08] and said
[1:03:09] i am the lord god of abraham thy father
[1:03:13] and the god of isaac
[1:03:15] the land wherein thou liest notice this
[1:03:17] here to thee will i give it
[1:03:20] and to thy seed and thy seed shall be as
[1:03:23] the dust of the earth and shall spread
[1:03:24] abroad to the west let's move on down to
[1:03:26] verse 15.
[1:03:28] and behold i
[1:03:31] am with
[1:03:33] thee
[1:03:35] that's a powerful thing when you read
[1:03:36] that
[1:03:38] it's a powerful thing when god joins
[1:03:41] himself to a life
[1:03:44] and i want you to understand how
[1:03:46] powerful because this is going to be
[1:03:47] something that's going to mean something
[1:03:48] to you this morning i want you to
[1:03:49] understand how powerful of a word that
[1:03:52] god a promise that god dismay joke jacob
[1:03:54] behold i am with thee
[1:03:59] and will keep thee
[1:04:01] in all

[1:04:08] all the wrong ways

[1:04:22] you're going to take a lot of turns i
[1:04:23] never told you to take
[1:04:25] you're going to make a lot of wrong
[1:04:26] choices but jacob i want you to know how
[1:04:28] sure my promise is when i say go left

[1:04:43] whether thou goest and will bring thee
[1:04:46] again into this land for i will not

[1:04:53] spoken to thee
[1:04:55] of

[1:04:59] that he gives him i'll be with thee no
[1:05:01] matter where you go jacob wherever thou
[1:05:04] goest i'm gonna go i'll not leave thee
[1:05:08] until i have done that which i have
[1:05:10] spoken
[1:05:14] so what was god doing i want you to
[1:05:16] catch this god was joining himself
[1:05:20] he was attaching himself
[1:05:22] to this son
[1:05:24] god was joining himself and he makes he
[1:05:26] makes a pledge and says he says i'm
[1:05:29] going to make a promise to you jacob i'm
[1:05:31] never going to leave you i'm never going
[1:05:32] to forsake you i'm going to stay right
[1:05:34] beside you
[1:05:37] and the bible says jacob woke up out of
[1:05:39] his sleep and he says oh the lord
[1:05:42] how how how awesome let's read it here
[1:05:44] the bible says and he woke out of his
[1:05:46] sleep and said surely the lord verse 16
[1:05:48] is in this place and i knew it not
[1:05:51] and he was afraid and said how dreadful
[1:05:52] that word dreadful actually means
[1:05:54] awesome in our english word
[1:05:56] how dreadful is this place this is none
[1:05:58] other but the house of god and this is
[1:06:01] the gate of heaven and jacob rose up
[1:06:03] early in the morning and he takes the
[1:06:05] stone that he had put for his pillows
[1:06:07] and he set it up for a pillar and he
[1:06:09] pours oil over the top of it jacob just
[1:06:11] doesn't know what to do he's beside
[1:06:12] himself
[1:06:14] he wakes up out of this dream and here's
[1:06:16] the lord and there's a ladder going up
[1:06:17] and down that man there's angels
[1:06:20] descending and ascending and god is over
[1:06:22] the top of it and what's god showing
[1:06:24] jacob i'm always busy at work jacob
[1:06:26] whether you see me or you feel me or you
[1:06:29] hear me or you feel that i'm moving just
[1:06:31] know this jacob in your life i've made a
[1:06:34] promise and there's angels that are
[1:06:36] descending and ascending on your behalf
[1:06:38] when you're struggling and you're
[1:06:40] praying and you're thinking did god just
[1:06:41] forgive me and what about my children
[1:06:43] and i'm continuing to pray let me give
[1:06:46] you let me break your eyes open to a
[1:06:48] vision if you're discouraged there's
[1:06:49] angels that are ascending and descending
[1:06:52] over your life and god is always busy
[1:06:55] at work in your life whether you feel
[1:06:57] him or see him
[1:07:02] he never stops
[1:07:06] it's a promise
[1:07:08] and jacob wakes up and he's he's beside
[1:07:11] himself and he's he's just trying to do
[1:07:12] anything he doesn't know what to do and
[1:07:14] surely the lord was in this place and i
[1:07:16] knew it not and and so he takes the
[1:07:18] stone and he's laid on the stone and he
[1:07:20] takes the stone and he picks it up and
[1:07:22] he's he's
[1:07:23] putting stone over stone he says okay
[1:07:24] this is this is where my head was this
[1:07:26] is where i was sleeping him and i want
[1:07:28] and i'm going to take the stone and then
[1:07:29] jacob says i got i got to consecrate
[1:07:31] this place this is a special place the
[1:07:33] lord met me and so he takes the oil and
[1:07:36] he doesn't know he's not being told to
[1:07:38] do this by the lord he's not been given
[1:07:40] and kind of the lord didn't say this in
[1:07:41] the dream but jacob is trying to do
[1:07:43] something in a human way to represent
[1:07:45] what happened in a spiritual way and
[1:07:47] oftentimes friends we do things
[1:07:50] physically and we wonder why because a
[1:07:52] lot of times what you do physically
[1:07:54] naturally god recognizes and notices
[1:07:58] in another dimension somewhere
[1:08:00] because little does jacob know when he's
[1:08:02] taking those stones and he's building
[1:08:04] that altar and he's pouring oil over the
[1:08:06] top of it
[1:08:09] god is watching
[1:08:11] and we're going to find out in a minute
[1:08:12] god notices what jacob does right there
[1:08:16] and jacob's pouring oil and he's saying
[1:08:18] oh the lord was in this place and i
[1:08:20] didn't even know it and oh my i just
[1:08:23] gotta i gotta make a memorial out of
[1:08:25] this and and the lord is watching and
[1:08:26] jacob takes the stone and he pours the
[1:08:28] oil and and he says this is he was
[1:08:30] afraid and said how dreadful and and
[1:08:33] verse 19 and he called the name of the
[1:08:35] place bethel
[1:08:37] he called the name of the place so he
[1:08:39] names it he gives it oil he he marks
[1:08:42] that spot
[1:08:45] he marks that spot and says the lord had
[1:08:47] done something for me right here
[1:08:51] how awesome is this place
[1:08:53] this is none other than the house of god
[1:08:56] and he names it bethel
[1:09:02] you think my what a powerful experience
[1:09:04] now my the lord is just with him he's
[1:09:07] made this powerful promise and he's got
[1:09:09] this consecration and what a miraculous
[1:09:12] thing do you know what happens
[1:09:14] directly you know you know you say what
[1:09:16] happens after that brother matt
[1:09:18] what have what what is his life story
[1:09:20] surely it starts taking a course towards
[1:09:22] the lord
[1:09:24] no
[1:09:26] no somehow some way
[1:09:29] 20
[1:09:30] long
[1:09:32] years the bible calls it 20 years you
[1:09:34] know it's amazing the bible speaks in
[1:09:36] time because we relate to things
[1:09:38] literally like in a time line
[1:09:41] and we understand our life by where we
[1:09:43] were yesterday where we're going to be
[1:09:45] in 10 years and where we were look at
[1:09:47] pictures and you look at your family
[1:09:49] when their children were small and it
[1:09:51] brings an emotion upon you then you
[1:09:53] think of where life and you look at the
[1:09:55] you look at your parents and they're
[1:09:56] getting older and you understand all of
[1:09:58] this because we're creatures of time and
[1:10:00] that's how we relate to everything
[1:10:02] you know the lord relates to time also
[1:10:05] he looks at time completely different
[1:10:07] than the way that you look at time
[1:10:11] but 20 long years passing jacob's life
[1:10:14] after this experience and he creates
[1:10:17] this altar and he calls it bethel and
[1:10:19] he's lo he's pouring anointing oil on it
[1:10:23] 20 long years
[1:10:26] years of
[1:10:28] a lot of sorrow
[1:10:30] years of a lot of
[1:10:32] trial
[1:10:34] years of a lot of turbulence
[1:10:38] years of a lot of disobedience
[1:10:42] but you know what the lord was with him
[1:10:46] every year
[1:10:47] every month
[1:10:48] every hour
[1:10:50] every moment
[1:10:52] because he made a promise
[1:10:55] i'm joining myself to you
[1:10:58] jacob
[1:10:59] after bethel after that experience he
[1:11:02] leaves and he settles down
[1:11:04] and and he's and he's a quickly it's
[1:11:07] amazing how quickly he forgets the glory
[1:11:09] and the all and the wonder as the
[1:11:11] prophet says about the ephesian age he
[1:11:13] says eventually the glory left the
[1:11:14] wonder of their message left
[1:11:17] and they had forgotten that's why god
[1:11:18] brother branham says remember and recall
[1:11:21] you remember that in ephesian church age
[1:11:23] remember and recall your former your
[1:11:25] former experience
[1:11:28] and how quickly we go from one
[1:11:30] mountaintop and one glorified glory
[1:11:33] filled experience and how quickly we
[1:11:35] move from that then we descend down and
[1:11:37] back into our own carnal ways and carnal
[1:11:39] nature
[1:11:42] and jacob goes from there and he settles
[1:11:44] down and and he and he leaves bethel and
[1:11:47] he forgets about all that he becomes
[1:11:49] lustful and cold and backslidden and
[1:11:51] carnal and he's away from the lord and
[1:11:54] and so god speaks to him again i want
[1:11:56] you to notice after 20 years the lord
[1:11:58] speaks in verse chapter 31 let's look at
[1:12:01] chapter 31 here just just quickly turn
[1:12:04] there
[1:12:05] god speaks to jacob again
[1:12:07] and he comes back to him after all of
[1:12:09] these years of of backsliding notice
[1:12:12] what god says to jacob chapter 31 verse
[1:12:15] 13 i
[1:12:17] am the god
[1:12:20] of bethel
[1:12:23] where thou anointest
[1:12:26] the pillar
[1:12:28] aha
[1:12:30] so what jacob thought he was just doing
[1:12:31] and everybody might have said oh he was
[1:12:33] just being emotional
[1:12:35] oh he just got worked up and he got all
[1:12:37] emotional well you know sometimes when
[1:12:40] you get all worked up and you get
[1:12:41] emotional you might get criticized but
[1:12:43] god takes notice and he watches
[1:12:47] and he says you know jacob remember
[1:12:49] where you anointed the pillar and where
[1:12:51] you poured oil over top of it i'm that
[1:12:54] god i'm the god of that experience i'm
[1:12:56] not the god of all of this carnality i'm
[1:12:58] not the god of this coldness in this
[1:13:00] lukewarmness i'm the god of bethel jacob
[1:13:03] where you vow to vow now here's the
[1:13:05] message of the lord now
[1:13:07] arise like he said to that daughter of
[1:13:09] zion awake arise put on your strength
[1:13:12] what are you doing
[1:13:16] arise get thee out from this land
[1:13:20] and return unto the land of thy kindred
[1:13:25] this is my promise to you jacob he's in
[1:13:27] the apathy he's completely settled and
[1:13:29] he's backslidden and the lord appears
[1:13:31] and says i'm the god of bethel jacob
[1:13:33] come back to bethel you've got to go
[1:13:36] back to where you were
[1:13:37] i you vowed a vow you anointed a pillar
[1:13:40] it was a powerful experience jacob
[1:13:44] and god had made a promise this is what
[1:13:46] god was saying remember how i touched
[1:13:48] you remember how i spoke to you i came
[1:13:50] to you in a dream and i gave you a
[1:13:52] vision remember jacob
[1:13:55] go back to bethel
[1:13:58] the word of the lord hadn't changed in
[1:14:00] jacob's life
[1:14:02] god was saying i'm going to be with you
[1:14:04] no matter where you go jacob
[1:14:07] no matter where you go
[1:14:08] i'm going to be right beside you all the
[1:14:11] time
[1:14:12] jacob i'm never going to depart my
[1:14:15] promise is still going to be the same
[1:14:17] i'm not going to change it jacob i'm
[1:14:19] going to still tell you the same exact
[1:14:21] thing i'm going to keep repeating it
[1:14:23] jacob because i've made a promise to you

[1:14:35] turn somewhere you may have made a
[1:14:36] u-turn and god didn't tell you to make
[1:14:38] that u-turn and you made choices and you
[1:14:40] made decisions and now you're looking
[1:14:42] around going oh i got myself into a mess

[1:14:49] same i'll never leave you i never i want

[1:15:26] taken so many wrong turns my promise
[1:15:28] i'll never leave you i'll never forsake

[1:15:49] upon you to say wake up awake shake
[1:15:52] yourself from the dust
[1:15:55] because i know what i put inside of you
[1:15:57] jacob
[1:15:59] and i'm going to keep preaching to that
[1:16:02] life that i put down
[1:16:03] and it may have been covered over by all
[1:16:05] kinds of years of complexes that may
[1:16:07] have been covered over and it may be
[1:16:09] built over with layers upon layers upon
[1:16:11] layers of of sorrow and layers of trials
[1:16:14] and layers of reasons
[1:16:16] but i'm just going to keep on
[1:16:19] and i'm gonna keep on
[1:16:21] you know that's one thing about the lord
[1:16:22] he's steady he never stops
[1:16:24] he's consistent he just keeps on and he
[1:16:27] keeps on and he keeps on jacob come back
[1:16:30] to bethel
[1:16:33] you think lord finally you got a hold of
[1:16:35] jacob finally he got his attention
[1:16:37] surely jacob's going to shake himself
[1:16:40] no
[1:16:42] what happens after genesis 31 13 when
[1:16:44] god says come back to bethel god says go
[1:16:46] left jacob says yes lord yeah not yet
[1:16:49] lord
[1:16:52] and the bible says he goes instead
[1:16:55] to a land
[1:16:57] of shechem
[1:16:59] genesis 33 turn there if you could
[1:17:03] he goes instead to sheck him and the
[1:17:05] bible says
[1:17:09] i want you just to follow along with me
[1:17:11] i'll wait for you to get to it here he
[1:17:13] settles down in a place called shechem
[1:17:16] in hebrew
[1:17:17] the city has a meaning the name meaning
[1:17:20] the meaning of shechem means
[1:17:22] going back
[1:17:24] not going back to bethel
[1:17:26] backsliding
[1:17:29] it also means a place of burden
[1:17:33] a place
[1:17:34] of burden
[1:17:36] do you know that any time
[1:17:38] you disobey what the lord tells you
[1:17:42] i can tell you where you're headed
[1:17:43] you're headed to a place of burdens
[1:17:49] heavy burdens
[1:17:51] and jacob you're going to find out
[1:17:54] shechem is not the
[1:17:56] checkup is not the the the the
[1:17:59] hollywood picture that you think it is
[1:18:01] the hollywood painting and it's so
[1:18:03] pleasurable and so wonderful and there's
[1:18:05] just so much joy there no you're gonna
[1:18:07] find out when you get there jacob
[1:18:09] the world has nothing to offer you
[1:18:14] its temporary pleasures
[1:18:17] will leave you busted
[1:18:19] broke
[1:18:20] depressed
[1:18:22] complexed
[1:18:26] empty
[1:18:29] and full of burdens
[1:18:31] why didn't you go back to bethel jacob
[1:18:33] where are you going jacob the lord told
[1:18:35] you to go back he's revealed he's
[1:18:36] appeared to you he hears his word go
[1:18:38] back to bethel jacob and some something
[1:18:41] inside of him you know the problem is is
[1:18:43] that jacob is being jacob
[1:18:45] and until jacob receives a name change
[1:18:48] and stops being jacob he's going to
[1:18:50] continue to be jacob
[1:18:52] he's going to continue to be jacob he's
[1:18:54] going to continue to fill out to fulfill
[1:18:56] out what jacob wants
[1:18:59] it's incredible because you notice
[1:19:00] people so often want free of problems
[1:19:03] that sin causes
[1:19:05] speaking and counseling to a man here
[1:19:07] just the other day and his wife was
[1:19:08] ready to leave him and he was he was he
[1:19:11] was caught in a sin that he just
[1:19:14] continually goes back to and his wife is
[1:19:16] ready he's not not even a believer of
[1:19:18] the message and i'm counseling him he's

[1:19:38] tried a psychologist i i looked i i've
[1:19:40] tried i've tried every kind of thing
[1:19:41] that i can and i just can't be free of

[1:19:53] christian woman and here this man's been
[1:19:55] in church his entire life heard the word
[1:19:58] heard his dad preach his entire life
[1:19:59] heard the pastor preach his entire life
[1:20:01] and and he knows the bible and he's
[1:20:03] saying i've tried everything i've i've
[1:20:06] i've i've tried he said here you're the
[1:20:07] last resort his mother had contacted us
[1:20:10] because i prayed for the man the
[1:20:12] associate pastor at stage four hopkins
[1:20:14] lymphoma and we prayed we prayed for
[1:20:17] that man laid it laid our hands upon him
[1:20:19] and prayed for that and spent time two
[1:20:21] or three hours in his living room just
[1:20:22] witnessing to him and talking to him and
[1:20:24] speaking to him and testifying about
[1:20:26] cancer and sister elena butts in mind in
[1:20:28] louisiana
[1:20:30] showed the pet scan of sister elena as
[1:20:33] just they had just showed me his pet
[1:20:34] scan and he's full of cancer and the
[1:20:36] doctors have given up on him and given
[1:20:38] him any hope and and pretty much told
[1:20:40] him you know it's there's really nothing
[1:20:42] we can do
[1:20:43] and he shows the ped skin his wife shows
[1:20:45] me the pet scan i said let me show you a
[1:20:47] pet scam i showed him sister elena's
[1:20:49] pet's gonna look just like he's full of
[1:20:50] cancer i said you know what but what
[1:20:52] what the lord did to that sister i said
[1:20:54] there's a woman that i family that i
[1:20:56] know in louisiana and i said and and and
[1:20:59] you know she was diagnosed with stage
[1:21:00] four hopkins lymphoma just like you were
[1:21:04] beginning to tetanus testified a human
[1:21:06] witness to him and you could just feel
[1:21:07] the atmosphere in his living room change
[1:21:09] and i began to speak to him about what
[1:21:12] cancer is really i was just going
[1:21:13] through what brother branham taught us
[1:21:15] and what is cancer and healing if you
[1:21:17] have that book and i started to tell him
[1:21:20] you know doctors treat the that tumor
[1:21:22] that's on your neck is just a body what
[1:21:24] you have to understand is that there's a
[1:21:26] life that's living behind that tumor
[1:21:29] it's a spirit of cancer diseases that
[1:21:31] names cancer is just a name that science
[1:21:34] has given to a spirit but there's a life
[1:21:37] behind that cancer
[1:21:40] and the prophet says there's a life
[1:21:42] living off your life sucking the life
[1:21:44] sucking like a bloodsucker sucking the
[1:21:46] life out of you
[1:21:47] and the prophet says now when i pray for
[1:21:49] you and i told this man i said when i
[1:21:51] pray for you i said i'm not gonna speak
[1:21:53] to the physical cancer that we see
[1:21:55] visibly that's what the doctor's for
[1:21:57] thank god for doctors thank god for
[1:22:00] surgeons thank god thank god for
[1:22:01] medicine
[1:22:02] i said that's what the doctor does the
[1:22:04] doctor has a bag and inside that bag are
[1:22:07] tools that he uses and if he brother
[1:22:09] brandon said if he could take that knife
[1:22:10] and scrape out all that cancer then good
[1:22:13] i said but i've got a different tool bag
[1:22:14] i've got a bag but there's different
[1:22:16] tools inside of it
[1:22:18] and and i said when i pray for you i'm
[1:22:20] not going to speak to the physical i
[1:22:22] said but i'm going to speak as jesus
[1:22:24] spoke in mark chapter 9 a deaf man came
[1:22:27] to and dumb man came to jesus and the
[1:22:29] bible says that jesus spoke to the foul
[1:22:31] spirit and jesus said thou deaf and dumb
[1:22:36] spirit he didn't say deaf and dumb
[1:22:39] disease he said deaf and dumb spirit
[1:22:42] he spoke to the life that was hiding
[1:22:45] behind the name
[1:22:49] and then brother adam says what is he
[1:22:51] going to do so i said when i pray for
[1:22:52] you i'm going to speak to the spirit
[1:22:53] that's living there
[1:22:56] i just testified we witnessed had a
[1:22:58] wonderful time
[1:22:59] had a wonderful time in prayer believing
[1:23:01] the lord's touched this man
[1:23:03] and they were so moved by the things
[1:23:05] that that we said there his mom the the
[1:23:08] the wife contacted and said i've got a
[1:23:10] son is at the end of his marriage and
[1:23:12] he's got a spirit they actually got on
[1:23:14] sunday morning and i was preaching on
[1:23:16] demon demonic spirits and the and the
[1:23:19] how that we're commissioned and with the
[1:23:20] churches ordained to cast out demon
[1:23:23] spirits
[1:23:24] and i was preaching on that and they
[1:23:25] actually streamed our entire service
[1:23:29] and said i've got a son can he come to
[1:23:30] you i want you to pray so here i am
[1:23:31] sitting with this man
[1:23:33] and he's he's at the end and he's saying
[1:23:35] i can't i've tried everything i've i've
[1:23:37] tried self-help i've tried i've tried
[1:23:39] tried to get rid of it and i just keep
[1:23:41] coming back to this and he said and i
[1:23:43] heard a voice speak to me and say oh you
[1:23:45] thought you had me but i've got you
[1:23:50] and he said and so i begin to just to
[1:23:52] deal with this man and i said you know i
[1:23:54] said it's repentance is so amazing
[1:23:56] because
[1:23:58] true repentance is not a prayer that you
[1:24:00] can pray right now
[1:24:01] true repentance is not oh i'm sorry
[1:24:04] true repentance is not i got called i'm
[1:24:07] sorry true repentance is not i'm sick of
[1:24:09] this what sin is causing that's not
[1:24:12] repentance
[1:24:13] and i said you have to be so careful
[1:24:15] because
[1:24:16] as jesus came to the man at the pull of
[1:24:18] bethesda and the bible says he's an
[1:24:20] invalid for 38 years he's laying there
[1:24:23] in his mat and jesus walks right up to
[1:24:25] him and you notice i said it was sin
[1:24:27] that had put him there how do you know
[1:24:29] because after jesus prays he says go in
[1:24:31] sin no more
[1:24:33] so sin
[1:24:34] had created bad circumstances in his
[1:24:37] life
[1:24:38] sin had created back pain sin had
[1:24:42] created neck pain joint pain
[1:24:46] sin had created a life that was laying
[1:24:48] on a mat at a bed on a bed in front of a
[1:24:51] pool
[1:24:52] and here this man is groveling in his
[1:24:54] pain and groveling in his torment and
[1:24:56] jesus comes right up to him and i said
[1:24:58] you notice jesus doesn't kneel down and
[1:25:00] say
[1:25:01] man buddy wow oh
[1:25:04] oh you got to be in so much pain
[1:25:07] oh my goodness it's got to hurt you so
[1:25:09] bad
[1:25:10] maybe i can help that you won't you want
[1:25:11] help does that hurt you as your back
[1:25:13] hurt you i said jesus never did any of
[1:25:15] that he never came to the man and said
[1:25:16] oh man your life man it's just it just i
[1:25:19] know it's got to be painful your wife's
[1:25:21] leaving you and your home's a wreck and
[1:25:24] and you've lost your job and you know he
[1:25:26] never comes the alcoholic i said i said
[1:25:28] listen josh i said the alcoholic he
[1:25:31] hates he hates what alcohol does to his
[1:25:34] life
[1:25:36] he hates that it destroys his marriage
[1:25:39] he hates that it destroys his job he
[1:25:41] loses his license he's driving a moped
[1:25:45] he hates it
[1:25:47] he hates it
[1:25:49] and i said this man hated what sin had
[1:25:52] caused but there's a very big difference
[1:25:54] between hating what sin causes
[1:25:58] and hating sin
[1:26:01] and true repentance is not when you say
[1:26:04] i just want free of all that sin has
[1:26:06] caused me no true repentance is when you
[1:26:08] say i hate the sin and i want holiness
[1:26:11] and i want righteousness and i want the
[1:26:14] spirit and the life of god to take the
[1:26:16] place of this carnal nature
[1:26:20] and i said here you are at the end of
[1:26:22] your rope and your house is on fire of
[1:26:24] course you want help
[1:26:26] i said but really where's your real
[1:26:28] repentance are you sick and tired do you
[1:26:30] hate the sin
[1:26:31] or you just hate the results of what sin
[1:26:33] is bringing
[1:26:35] because sin will wreck your life
[1:26:39] disobedience will wreck and ruin your
[1:26:41] children and your family and your
[1:26:43] atmosphere and your relationships
[1:26:45] it'll lead you to places of great
[1:26:47] burdens
[1:26:50] jesus is here to set you free
[1:26:52] if you want to be free of those burdens
[1:26:56] i said he said to the man he did he says
[1:26:59] will you be made whole
[1:27:04] the man starts all well every year you
[1:27:06] know the angel comes and i try to have
[1:27:08] no man to pick me up and to carry me in
[1:27:10] and to put me into the water and every
[1:27:12] single year and and jesus just listens
[1:27:14] and you know what it's amazing is after
[1:27:16] the man repeat tells his entire sob
[1:27:18] story jesus just ignores what he said
[1:27:20] and then he just repeats himself will
[1:27:22] you be made whole
[1:27:27] in other words i want to know you got to
[1:27:29] be you could never be honest with the
[1:27:31] lord until you're honest with yourself
[1:27:35] will you be made whole
[1:27:39] do you want to be free not of problems
[1:27:41] because problems aren't going to go away
[1:27:43] in fact your trouble begins when you
[1:27:45] come to serve the lord that's when real
[1:27:47] trials start that's when the real
[1:27:49] struggle begins
[1:27:52] but i want to know do you hate the sin
[1:27:54] will you be made whole
[1:27:59] and jacob learns through all this
[1:28:00] disobedience he comes to a place of
[1:28:02] burdens
[1:28:05] because he's jacob
[1:28:08] and shechem he's going to get into all
[1:28:10] kinds of trouble
[1:28:13] you notice he settles down and check him
[1:28:15] and
[1:28:16] and it's just a place of
[1:28:18] burden
[1:28:21] come back to bethel he hears the word of
[1:28:23] the lord
[1:28:24] come back to bethel jacob go back to
[1:28:27] your
[1:28:28] your altar where you anointed
[1:28:31] the stones
[1:28:33] go back jacob
[1:28:35] jacob decides i'm just going to settle
[1:28:37] over here
[1:28:39] and you know what happens his entire
[1:28:40] house is defiled
[1:28:44] his daughter's raped
[1:28:47] his son commits murder to save his
[1:28:49] sister
[1:28:51] you say my goodness that's horrible yeah
[1:28:55] a lot of collateral damage you know what
[1:28:58] carnage
[1:28:59] carnage
[1:29:00] is what the devil wants for your life
[1:29:07] carnage just complete utter destruction
[1:29:11] and he'll sell it in the most prettiest
[1:29:13] package

[1:29:18] but he wants to destroy you say well i'm
[1:29:20] all right i'm i'm still okay i'm not a
[1:29:22] drug addict and i'm not i'm i don't do
[1:29:24] drugs and i don't you know i don't i
[1:29:26] don't even drink alcohol and i don't
[1:29:27] smoke i'm a healthy person i run every
[1:29:29] day and you know what you know what the
[1:29:31] devil if can't get you there the devil
[1:29:33] will destroy your mind
[1:29:35] he'll give you such a perverted spirit
[1:29:37] and a perverted mind to where you don't
[1:29:39] even desire the things of god you have
[1:29:42] no desire for it
[1:29:45] but the lord says i come
[1:29:47] that you might have life
[1:29:50] and that you might have it more
[1:29:51] abundantly
[1:29:53] i desire that you prosper and be in
[1:29:55] health
[1:29:56] even as your
[1:29:58] soul
[1:29:59] prospereth
[1:30:03] what a horrible story
[1:30:06] jacob
[1:30:08] all because
[1:30:10] of disobedience to the lord
[1:30:13] you know what's so amazing
[1:30:15] to me about the story is that if i was
[1:30:17] the father and this was my son and i'm
[1:30:20] looking at this from a natural
[1:30:21] perspective how quickly each one of us
[1:30:24] how quickly if we were to play the role
[1:30:26] of god if we were to sit jacob down and
[1:30:28] we read his story we read now his
[1:30:30] daughter's raped and his son's a
[1:30:32] murderer and there's this carnage you
[1:30:34] know what we would do we would say oh my
[1:30:36] goodness jacob you sorry rascal
[1:30:39] my goodness look at what you've caused
[1:30:42] god should have given up on you a long
[1:30:43] time ago how he ever even seen anything
[1:30:45] in you i have no idea you've made a mess
[1:30:49] you've made a mess it's so amazing how
[1:30:51] different the lord treats
[1:30:53] people and how god's children treat each
[1:30:56] other
[1:30:59] oh man it's the truth anyways
[1:31:02] so incredible how quickly we are to
[1:31:04] judge and to cast judgment and cast
[1:31:06] stones and destroy people who are
[1:31:08] already struggling and we think our
[1:31:10] christian duty is just to stomp them
[1:31:12] down when they're already down
[1:31:15] it's so amazing how differently the lord
[1:31:17] handles disobedient children and how we
[1:31:20] handle
[1:31:21] disobedient
[1:31:27] help us lord
[1:31:29] so amazing if you could say to jacob
[1:31:31] jacob what are you doing
[1:31:36] you've had chance after chance after
[1:31:38] chance

[1:40:35] notice here in genesis 35 if you could
[1:40:37] put it on the screen brother verse 1
[1:40:40] god said unto jacob arise

[1:40:45] go back to the first
[1:40:47] place
[1:40:51] and dwell

[1:40:56] there
[1:40:57] settle
[1:40:59] there

[1:41:06] because i'm the god of bethel
[1:41:10] i'll never leave you jacob
[1:41:13] i'll never
[1:41:15] i'll never depart from you
[1:41:17] i've joined myself
[1:41:19] to you
[1:41:22] and just like god joined himself to
[1:41:24] sampson and he said i'm going to make
[1:41:25] him a promise it's going to last from
[1:41:27] his birth
[1:41:28] all the way to his death
[1:41:31] all the way till he breathes his last
[1:41:34] breath my promise is still right beside
[1:41:37] you
[1:41:40] my promise is how far away is it it's
[1:41:42] right beside you
[1:41:45] sampson all you ever had to do was
[1:41:47] surrender to what god wanted to do in
[1:41:49] your life
[1:41:51] but what if samson did make the wrong
[1:41:52] choice the bad decision wrong choice bad
[1:41:54] decision wrong choice bad decision
[1:41:57] heard the voice of the lord kept going
[1:41:59] the other way heard the voice of god you
[1:42:01] say brother man did god ever finally one
[1:42:03] day just give up on him say you know
[1:42:04] what
[1:42:05] you know what sampson i'm just you know
[1:42:08] i'm just i'm retracting everything just
[1:42:10] forget it
[1:42:11] forget i even ask you samson
[1:42:15] he said that to jacob oh just you know
[1:42:17] what jacob i'm i've given you so many
[1:42:19] opportunities i've given you so many
[1:42:22] chances here you are again
[1:42:26] you know what jacob just man just never
[1:42:28] mind
[1:42:30] sorry i even asked you jacob sorry i
[1:42:33] even asked you just i've told you time
[1:42:35] and time again but you know what if
[1:42:36] that's how you're gonna if that if
[1:42:38] that's what you're gonna oh no the lord
[1:42:39] never says that to him
[1:42:42] you see the lord will never give up i
[1:42:44] know i've said it i'm going to say it
[1:42:45] again he'll never quit
[1:42:47] he'll never stop he'll never give up
[1:42:49] he'll keep chasing you you might keep
[1:42:51] running but he'll keep following he'll
[1:42:53] stay right beside you just like you did
[1:42:55] think of thomas here thomas was down and
[1:42:57] here there's the risen lord and then
[1:42:59] there's all the disciples and they're
[1:43:01] rejoicing and they're shouting thomas
[1:43:03] says no
[1:43:09] unless i touch his hands
[1:43:12] what did thomas need any physical proof
[1:43:16] unless i touch his hands
[1:43:19] i won't even believe
[1:43:21] and in walks the lord jesus
[1:43:27] and you know what
[1:43:28] jesus is hugging peter and hugging all
[1:43:30] of his brothers hugging all his brethren
[1:43:32] all oh lord oh lord you know the bible
[1:43:35] doesn't say that as he's hugging you
[1:43:36] know peter he he sort of peers over
[1:43:39] thomas
[1:43:42] thomas
[1:43:45] i couldn't believe
[1:43:48] you couldn't believe unless you seen me
[1:43:49] huh you know the lord never does that to
[1:43:51] doubting thomas and the lord never does
[1:43:54] that to doubting people
[1:43:56] he never gives up you know what jesus
[1:43:58] does jesus walks over to thomas
[1:44:02] and he reaches out his hand
[1:44:04] and he says here you go thomas
[1:44:07] you want to touch my hands
[1:44:09] you want to feel that they're real you
[1:44:11] know why because brother branham said it
[1:44:12] this way
[1:44:14] when the woman asked he said brother
[1:44:15] brother branham the book of james says
[1:44:16] if they lay their hand upon the sick
[1:44:17] they will recover but you know the real
[1:44:19] genuine real gentile faith is just to
[1:44:21] accept it and believe it brother branham
[1:44:23] says but now remember remember he says
[1:44:25] yes that's true sister he says but
[1:44:27] remember i love this god will meet you
[1:44:30] at whatever level of faith you give him
[1:44:35] he'll come no matter how low he's got to
[1:44:37] go
[1:44:38] hallelujah he'll meet you at whatever
[1:44:41] little bit of faith that you can give
[1:44:43] him he didn't give up on thomas he
[1:44:45] didn't push thomas to the side he said
[1:44:46] you down thomas that's okay you know why
[1:44:48] it's okay because you're still my son
[1:44:51] and i made you that way thomas and so
[1:44:54] i'm going to give you physical literal
[1:44:56] proof because you need it for yourself
[1:44:59] people might have gave up on you thomas
[1:45:01] everyone else might have just pushed you
[1:45:03] to the side but here's my hands thomas
[1:45:05] reach out and touch them
[1:45:10] you know you say brother matt why
[1:45:11] because god is a kind loving heavenly
[1:45:15] father
[1:45:18] no matter how he's been portrayed and
[1:45:20] pictured to you maybe through a false
[1:45:23] understanding or maybe through a dad who
[1:45:25] didn't love you or a mother who didn't
[1:45:26] love you and you know sometimes children
[1:45:28] understand god's love by their parents
[1:45:31] love and sometimes that's a good thing
[1:45:33] other times it's not a good thing but
[1:45:35] let me just say he's a father to the
[1:45:36] fatherless he's a mother to the
[1:45:38] motherless he'll love you and never walk
[1:45:40] out on you he'll never abandon you he'll
[1:45:43] never stop chasing you he'll steep still
[1:45:46] coming out keep coming after you he says
[1:45:48] jacob until i've brought you into the
[1:45:50] place
[1:45:53] that i have seen
[1:45:55] before the foundation of the world jacob
[1:45:57] i'm going to keep working in your life
[1:46:00] say brother matt well i feel i may have
[1:46:02] just send my day grace away but the
[1:46:03] prophet of god answers that question too
[1:46:05] and says just the fact that you have a
[1:46:06] desire to ask that question
[1:46:10] proves that god still has mercy for you
[1:46:15] wake up
[1:46:16] child
[1:46:17] put on
[1:46:19] your strength
[1:46:22] put on your beautiful garment
[1:46:26] that's not who you are
[1:46:30] world might have told you you're
[1:46:31] enslaved and imprisoned that's not who
[1:46:33] you are
[1:46:35] that doesn't change anything
[1:46:37] you're still my child
[1:46:39] you're still my daughter
[1:46:41] what do i got to do lord
[1:46:44] wake up
[1:46:46] wake up
[1:46:47] you know that's what the preaching of
[1:46:48] the word does
[1:46:51] sometimes it has to wake people up
[1:46:53] physically
[1:46:57] other times it has to wake him up
[1:46:59] spiritually
[1:47:00] say wake him up it has to wake that gene
[1:47:03] seed of god that gene seed that he put
[1:47:05] down inside of you before the world
[1:47:09] and brother adam says when the word
[1:47:10] comes and it flashes across that seed
[1:47:13] you know but it's up to you
[1:47:15] it's your choice samson
[1:47:17] it's your choice
[1:47:20] it's your decision
[1:47:22] are you gonna live jacob continue to
[1:47:24] live like jacob
[1:47:26] you're gonna continue to live and go
[1:47:28] down and be in the same exact ditch
[1:47:29] you've been in and go down the same
[1:47:30] patterns and the same trails you've
[1:47:32] always been to that'll lead you to the
[1:47:34] same exact things they've been leading
[1:47:35] you to
[1:47:38] you're going to keep going that way are
[1:47:40] you going to surrender
[1:47:44] you're going to surrender to the path
[1:47:46] and the blueprint that god has laid for
[1:47:50] your life
[1:47:51] stand
[1:47:52] stand to your feet
[1:48:10] genesis 35 verse 2.
[1:48:14] then jacob
[1:48:16] said unto his
[1:48:18] household
[1:48:20] as we spoke last night it starts
[1:48:23] with
[1:48:24] the man
[1:48:27] it starts with
[1:48:29] the man
[1:48:32] jacob said notice read it with me verse
[1:48:34] 2 jacob said unto his household
[1:48:38] and to all that were with him
[1:48:42] put away the strange gods
[1:48:44] that are among you
[1:48:52] just going to take a moment get settled
[1:48:57] jacob said unto his household and to all
[1:48:59] that were with him
[1:49:01] this is where
[1:49:02] deliverance begins
[1:49:05] this is where change
[1:49:07] begins how do i start brother matt i've
[1:49:10] won it so bad i know i know that i need
[1:49:12] it so bad but where do i even begin it
[1:49:14] begins
[1:49:15] right
[1:49:16] here you start where you're standing at
[1:49:19] right now
[1:49:21] and jacob said put away the strange gods
[1:49:23] from among you and be
[1:49:26] clean and change your garments
[1:49:31] and here's a father who finally gets a
[1:49:33] revelation of what true restoration how
[1:49:35] does true healing begin with my family
[1:49:39] let us verse 3 arise and go
[1:49:43] up to bethel
[1:49:46] and i will make there an altar unto god
[1:49:49] who answered me in the day of my
[1:49:50] distress and was with me
[1:49:53] in the way which i went
[1:49:58] and they gave unto jacob
[1:50:00] all their strange gods
[1:50:02] that's what i said last night
[1:50:04] a family will fall in order
[1:50:07] when a father falls in line
[1:50:11] you say they just need to follow they
[1:50:12] just need to they just need to they just
[1:50:14] need to leave you they just need to
[1:50:16] listen that if i could just change my
[1:50:17] situation if i could just change this
[1:50:19] about my children if i could just change
[1:50:20] this about this stop stop looking at
[1:50:22] everybody everything and everybody
[1:50:23] around you if i could just change the
[1:50:25] church i could just change this and
[1:50:26] change that the change has to start
[1:50:28] right here if you'll change everything
[1:50:31] else around you will change
[1:50:33] he says take he says take away put away
[1:50:36] your strange garments put put away your
[1:50:38] strange gods and the bible says they
[1:50:40] gave unto jacob verse 4 the strange gods
[1:50:43] which were in their hand and all their
[1:50:45] earrings which were in their ears and
[1:50:46] jacob hid them under the oak which was
[1:50:48] by shechem and they journeyed and the
[1:50:50] terror of god was upon the cities that
[1:50:52] were round about them and they did not
[1:50:53] pursue the sons of jacob what happens
[1:50:56] when the family when the son of god
[1:50:58] comes back and realigns himself
[1:51:01] with the purpose of god god
[1:51:04] fights for that son
[1:51:06] and god surrounds that family with a
[1:51:09] promise

[1:51:12] to be sheltered i want the protection of
[1:51:14] god stay in tune and in line with the
[1:51:17] voice of god for your life
