[1:08] strengthen them and help them Lord and
[1:10] we just we just ask this blessing upon
[1:12] these knees in your name amen you can be
[1:15] seated
[1:18] um
[1:31] I sure appreciate the brothers and
[1:33] sisters in the back for getting
[1:34] oh
[1:35] all this in working order
[1:41] I think I think it helps to have it on
[1:43] the screen a little bit
[1:44] so
[1:46] so we made it uh we we made it through
[1:48] Hebrews chapter seven and we're on
[1:51] Hebrews chapter 8 which just kind of
[1:53] continues that same thought but we'll
[1:55] want to kind of Jump Ahead like what
[1:57] we've been doing to kind of set the
[1:59] theme of what we're talking about that
[2:00] that where Paul says the law having a
[2:03] shadow of good things to come the law
[2:05] and that Old Testament law all those
[2:06] things that you see you read about in
[2:08] the Old Testament were a shadow of
[2:11] the coming of the eternal life that God
[2:14] could put his life into the heart of the
[2:16] believer and not the very image of the
[2:19] things can never with those sacrifices
[2:20] which they offered year by year
[2:21] continually make the comers there unto
[2:23] perfect but now we've got something that
[2:25] can make us perfect that can change our
[2:27] life change our way of thinking change
[2:30] everything about us
[2:32] so just to kind of summarize some of
[2:34] those things that we talked about last
[2:35] time that a shadow many things that were
[2:37] shattered in the Old Testament Joni and
[2:39] the Jonah and the belly of the well
[2:41] the bronze serpent the Mana that fell in
[2:44] the wilderness the rock of the
[2:45] Israelites drank from the Tabernacle in
[2:47] the wilderness all all these things were
[2:49] a shadow of Christ coming and dying for
[2:52] us that a shadow of Jesus Christ the
[2:55] first Adam compared to the second Adam
[2:57] the Passover Lamb the Cities of Refuge
[2:59] the temple veil torn compared to Jesus's
[3:02] body Isaac the promised son and on and
[3:05] on I mean you could list out uh probably
[3:07] take take a whole day to just list out
[3:10] all the the types and shadows in the Old
[3:13] Testament that were that were speaking
[3:15] of the coming of Christ
[3:18] so it's a shadow of good things to come
[3:20] the law the law shows what God demanded
[3:22] and Calvary shows what God provided to
[3:26] meet that demand so you know we kind of
[3:29] set set the in your thinking the last
[3:31] time we were speaking of it what if you
[3:33] could just take all of those take those
[3:34] Ten Commandments that Moses brought down
[3:36] from the from the uh from the mountain
[3:39] and and if you could put those into the
[3:42] believer's heart so now it wasn't
[3:43] something that you can read off a page
[3:45] and and say well I got to do this and I
[3:47] got to do that but put it into a
[3:49] believer's heart whether it could just
[3:50] be lived
[3:52] um if you know the the Torah is is a the
[3:56] Jews call it the Taurus it's a list of
[3:58] all the 613 Commandments if you go
[4:00] reading those I got to reading those the
[4:02] other day and it's um
[4:04] it's really good to just kind of
[4:06] meditate on all of the things that God
[4:08] wants us to do about how to conduct
[4:10] ourselves with one another and how to
[4:12] make good judgments and be uh make good
[4:15] uh decisions about uh you know when
[4:18] something somebody comes to court what's
[4:19] right and wrong and you put all of that
[4:21] put all of those things into a
[4:23] believer's heart so that it just becomes
[4:26] natural that you treat one another right
[4:28] and so that's that's what I'm gonna
[4:30] maybe we'll we'll take a brief uh aside
[4:33] or go on a rabbit Trail this morning and
[4:35] kind of look at what how the law is
[4:36] fulfilled in you oh
[4:39] so in Hebrews chapter 8 Paul begins to
[4:42] speak about he said now the things we
[4:43] have spoken this is the song now see
[4:45] he's going to some sum everything up
[4:47] we've got in high priest who is said on
[4:50] the right hand of the throne in the mat
[4:51] of the Majesty in the heavens a minister
[4:54] of the sanctuary and of the true
[4:55] Tabernacle which the Lord pitched and
[4:57] not man so what's he what's he setting
[4:59] in our mind he's sitting in the Old
[5:01] Testament you can see that Tabernacle
[5:03] that you could walk through that only
[5:04] the high priest could go into the holy
[5:05] of holies and all of the different
[5:07] Furnitures and things that went into it
[5:10] but that was a shadow of something
[5:11] that's real so now we've got access to
[5:14] the real what what is the real that God
[5:16] could come and dwell Into the Heart of
[5:18] the believer
[5:19] in Hebrews 9 chapter 9 he said for
[5:21] Christ has not entered into the holy
[5:23] places made with hands so we're not
[5:25] talking about something that just you
[5:27] can touch anymore but now God has
[5:28] entered into the heart of the believer
[5:30] which are the figures of the true but
[5:31] into heaven itself now to appear in the
[5:34] presence of God for us and doesn't
[5:36] doesn't the bible say that you're seated
[5:38] in Heavenly places with Christ if you're
[5:40] filled with the Holy Ghost you're seated
[5:42] in Heavenly places because now you're
[5:44] United with that eternal life
[5:46] so in Exodus chapter 25 it says and the
[5:49] tongue and the tongues that are speaking
[5:51] of the how the temple was made because
[5:52] Paul's he's about to start talking about
[5:54] the pattern in the mountain he said in
[5:57] the tongs thereof and the snuff dishes
[5:58] thereof shall be of pure gold of a
[6:00] talent of pure gold see how he make it
[6:02] with all these vessels and look that
[6:04] thou
[6:05] uh God's instructions to Moses look that
[6:08] thou make them after their pattern which
[6:10] will show thee in the mount what's the
[6:12] pattern that God doesn't want to just
[6:14] dwell in in a a building made with hands
[6:18] or a building Made of Stone but God
[6:20] wants to dwell in your heart he wants to
[6:22] dwell in you
[6:25] so in Hebrews chapter 8 verse 3 says for
[6:28] every high priest is ordained to offer
[6:30] gifts and sacrifices aware of it is of
[6:32] necessity that this man have somewhat
[6:34] also to offer
[6:36] for if he were on Earth he should not be
[6:38] a priest seeing that there are priests
[6:40] that offer gifts according to the law
[6:42] who serve unto the example and Shadow of
[6:44] heavenly things as Moses was admonished
[6:47] of God when he was about to make the
[6:48] Tabernacle foresee saith he that thou
[6:51] make all things according to the pattern
[6:53] show to thee in the mount so he's he's
[6:55] comparing that the natural things that
[6:57] the Old Testament priest did where they
[6:59] would they would kill animals and and
[7:01] they would offer gifts for the people
[7:02] but now he's taking it over to a
[7:04] spiritual form that this this is Spirit
[7:06] something spiritual is happening what's
[7:09] the spiritual gift is the gift of the
[7:11] Holy Ghost the gift of the Holy Ghost in
[7:13] your life and now this is something
[7:15] spiritual happening
[7:17] in verse 6 he says but now hath he
[7:19] obtained a more excellent Ministry by
[7:21] how much also he is the mediator of a
[7:23] better Covenant which was established
[7:26] upon better promises for that first
[7:28] Covenant had been followless there then
[7:31] no place had been sought for the second
[7:33] if that first Covenant was fine then you
[7:35] wouldn't need a you wouldn't need a
[7:37] second Covenant you wouldn't need a a
[7:39] different kind of priesthood an eternal
[7:41] priesthood you wouldn't need you
[7:43] wouldn't need the gift of the Holy Ghost
[7:44] you wouldn't need eternal life if that
[7:46] first Covenant was not lacking for
[7:50] finding fault with him he saith behold
[7:52] the days come saith the Lord when I will
[7:54] make a New Covenant with the house of
[7:55] Israel and with the house of Judah
[7:58] what's that New Covenant that Jeremiah
[8:01] talked about that that God's life that
[8:03] he would he would break just like
[8:05] Melchizedek did he broke bread and and
[8:08] and and and served wine and Jesus was
[8:10] which was a type of Jesus his flesh
[8:13] being torn and his life being poured out
[8:16] so that life could come back into the
[8:17] believer for this is the my blood of the
[8:20] new testament which is shared for many
[8:22] of the remission of sins is what Jesus
[8:23] said there in the upper room
[8:25] so in Jeremiah if we if we go back and
[8:28] read what that that prophecy of that new
[8:30] covenant is
[8:31] he said in Jeremiah verse 31 of chapter
[8:35] 31 behold the days comes that the Lord
[8:38] that I will make a New Covenant with the
[8:40] house of Israel and with the house of
[8:42] Judah
[8:43] not according to the Covenant that I
[8:45] made with their fathers in the day that
[8:46] I took them by the hand to bring them
[8:48] out of the land of Egypt which my
[8:50] Covenant they break although I wasn't
[8:52] husband unto them saith the Lord but
[8:54] this shall be the Covenant that I will
[8:55] make with a house of Israel after those
[8:58] days saith the Lord I will put my law in
[9:00] their inward parts and ride it in their
[9:02] hearts and will be their God and they
[9:05] shall be my people now that's a covenant
[9:08] now when God can take all of those 613
[9:10] Commandments all those law all that
[9:12] Torah all the things that God came down
[9:14] off the mountain with and put it into
[9:16] your heart so that you can love your
[9:18] neighbor so now you've got power to
[9:21] forgive somebody when they do something
[9:22] wrong to you because you've got the love
[9:25] of God in your heart that now you're
[9:27] actually fulfilling the essence of what
[9:29] the law is because the law Giver is in
[9:32] your heart and it's not a book of rules
[9:34] but God is living it out in your life
[9:36] when they shall teach no more every man
[9:38] is neighbor and every man is brother
[9:40] saying know the Lord for they shall all
[9:42] know me from the least of them under the
[9:44] greatest of them saith the Lord for I
[9:46] will forgive their iniquity and I will
[9:48] remember their sin no more you think
[9:50] about what a blessing it is that you can
[9:51] turn to your neighbor in church and when
[9:53] you walk out the doors that every holy
[9:56] ghost filled Believers got those
[9:57] Commandments in their heart and got the
[10:00] ability the power of God in their life
[10:02] to live those live those things out to
[10:04] to where the rest of the world can't
[10:06] love their neighbor but you can love
[10:08] your neighbor you can love somebody that
[10:10] smites you on your cheek and spits in
[10:12] your face because that's what the life
[10:14] of God gives you the power of God and
[10:16] the Heart of the believer to fulfill the
[10:19] essence of the Commandment
[10:22] so in verse 8 and of of Hebrews 8 he
[10:25] says for finding fault with him he saith
[10:27] behold the days come saith the Lord when
[10:29] I will make a New Covenant when the
[10:31] house of Israel and and with the house
[10:32] of Judah not according to the Covenant
[10:35] that I made with their fathers in the
[10:36] day when I took them
[10:38] uh
[10:39] I I I put this slide in here because I
[10:41] want to compare how Paul Paul what's he
[10:44] doing he's actually quoting what we just
[10:46] read in Jeremiah but I I wanted to kind
[10:49] of call out
[10:50] because you know sometimes people get a
[10:52] little bit critical to say well we're
[10:53] not quoting exactly but look how look
[10:55] how uh Paul he adds so he interpolates a
[10:58] little bit he adds his own little
[10:59] thought into his reading of Jeremiah and
[11:02] this is what I was talking about I was
[11:03] listening to it to a rabbi and he really
[11:06] blasted Paul for doing this and saying
[11:08] he he said all kinds of but you know
[11:11] what Paul's doing is he's bringing forth
[11:13] the essence of what Jeremiah is saying
[11:15] he's he's he's a he's he's elaborate
[11:18] he's putting his own words and things
[11:19] but the essence is the same as he quotes
[11:22] and he says not according to that so and
[11:24] right there in yellows is some of the
[11:26] things that Paul kind of he throws in
[11:28] there as he's quoting Jeremiah not
[11:31] according to the Covenant that I made
[11:32] with their fathers in the day when I
[11:33] took them by the hand to lead them out
[11:35] of the land of Egypt because they
[11:37] continue not in my Covenant and I
[11:39] regarded them not saith the Lord
[11:41] for this is the Covenant that I will
[11:43] make with the house of Israel after
[11:45] those days saith the Lord I will put my
[11:46] laws into their mind and write them in
[11:48] their hearts and I'll be to them a God
[11:49] and they should be to be a people and
[11:51] they shall not teach every man his
[11:52] neighbor and every man his brother is
[11:54] saying know the Lord For All Shall know
[11:55] me from the least to the greatest for I
[11:58] will be merciful to their
[11:59] unrighteousness and their sins and their
[12:01] iniquities well I'll remember no more
[12:04] now if you really study out the way that
[12:06] that the New Testament preachers quote
[12:09] of the Old Testament they do this a lot
[12:11] when they're when they're preaching
[12:12] they'll take a scripture over here in
[12:14] scripture over there and they'll put it
[12:15] together and they'll add they'll add and
[12:17] they'll because what are they doing
[12:18] they're preaching for now they're
[12:20] preaching from a revelation that it's
[12:22] not just something that just like uh
[12:24] they they're understanding the meaning
[12:26] of what is it needs to be communicated
[12:30] so brother Ram said you can't no matter
[12:33] what you do you quit drinking quit
[12:35] smoking quit telling lies go to church
[12:38] and try to do this and try to do that
[12:39] you're still carnal that's just law the
[12:42] law makes nothing perfect but what makes
[12:45] perfect Christ I might quit stealing
[12:48] quit quit lying quit stealing quit
[12:50] committing adultery quit chewing quit
[12:51] all the things and I'm still carnal God
[12:54] don't receive it because I have nothing
[12:56] to offer him in propitiation but the
[12:58] minute that I lay my hands upon the
[13:00] Blessed head of the Lord Jesus and say
[13:01] Lord I'm no good will you take me as
[13:04] your servant and God kisses away my sin
[13:06] I stand perfect and the sign of God
[13:10] that's right I'm not standing on my own
[13:13] Merit I'm standing on his and he has
[13:16] perfected us through his suffering and
[13:18] his blood you think about now I've got
[13:20] this picture of the cross the shadow of
[13:22] the Cross Laying across the scripture
[13:24] all of that that this that the Old
[13:26] Testament required all of that was
[13:28] fulfilled in Christ that when he died on
[13:30] the cross if you're in Christ then then
[13:32] the requirement has been met that the
[13:35] requirement has been satisfied because
[13:37] his blood paid the price for that
[13:40] but now I want to kind of get into
[13:42] something that's a little bit difficult
[13:43] to express is that is that you there is
[13:46] no requirement to come to the Cross but
[13:48] after you come to the cross and you're
[13:49] in him then it changes your life there's
[13:52] a before and after before there's no
[13:54] requirement to come to the Cross but
[13:56] after you come to the cross and get it
[13:57] in it will change your life
[13:59] thank you
[14:01] so Paul in verse 13 He says in this he
[14:04] saith a New Covenant he hath made the
[14:06] first old now that which decadeth and
[14:08] waxeth old is ready to vanish away
[14:11] so I got these bullet points here Christ
[14:14] sacrifice met every requirement of the
[14:17] law if you are in Christ every
[14:21] requirement has already been met there's
[14:24] no requirement for you to do anything
[14:26] it's not how much you pray or how much
[14:29] you push a penny with your nose or all
[14:31] you have to do is believe on the Lord
[14:33] Jesus Christ to receive your salvation
[14:36] but the Life of Christ and the believer
[14:39] will become a living manifestation of
[14:43] the essence of the law and it begins to
[14:46] express outward in you so there's no way
[14:48] there's no requirement for you to come
[14:50] to Christ but when you come to Christ
[14:52] you become the the word manifest on two
[14:55] feet
[14:56] now now so so Jesus said in chapter Mark
[14:59] chapter 12 he said and Jesus answered in
[15:01] the first of all the Commandments says
[15:02] Hear o Israel the Lord our God is one
[15:05] Lord he's he's kind of summing
[15:06] everything up all the Ten Commandments
[15:08] all the law everything the Lord hear our
[15:10] Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and
[15:13] thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
[15:14] all thy heart and with all thy soul and
[15:16] with all thy mind and with all thy
[15:18] strength this is the first commandment
[15:19] you put the you put the life of God into
[15:21] a Believer and now they can fulfill that
[15:23] because they love God in the way that
[15:27] they should the way that the Old
[15:29] Testament was was laid out and now it's
[15:31] not a commandment anymore now you love
[15:33] God and the second is like namely this
[15:36] Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[15:38] there is none other commandment greater
[15:40] than these now after after you're born
[15:42] again now you can love you're fulfilling
[15:46] that that law the law becomes manifest
[15:49] in you so that's why Romans chapter 8
[15:51] says what for what the law could not do
[15:53] and that it was weak through the flesh
[15:55] God sending his own son in the likeness
[15:58] of sinful flesh and for sin condemn sin
[16:01] in the flesh
[16:02] that the righteousness of the law might
[16:05] be fulfilled in us who walk not after
[16:08] the flesh but after the spirit you're
[16:10] not walking after the do's and don'ts
[16:12] anymore but you're walking after after a
[16:15] new law a law of love for they that are
[16:18] after The Flesh do mind the things of
[16:20] the flesh but they that are after the
[16:22] spirit the things of the spirit for to
[16:24] be carnally minded is death but to be
[16:26] spiritually minded is life and peace
[16:28] because the carnal mind is enmity
[16:31] against God for it is not subject to the
[16:34] law of God
[16:36] so
[16:37] if you're spiritually minded it becomes
[16:39] subject to the law of God neither in D
[16:42] can be so then they that are in the
[16:44] flesh cannot please God but you are not
[16:46] in the flesh but in the spirit if so be
[16:48] that the spirit of God dwell in you now
[16:50] if any man have not the spirit of Christ
[16:52] he is none of his
[16:54] now also in Romans chapter 13 it says oh
[16:57] no man anything but what to love one
[17:01] another
[17:02] for he that loveth another
[17:05] hath fulfilled the law
[17:08] you get the eternal life that life of
[17:11] God in you and you're able to express
[17:13] the love of God
[17:15] then you actually are fulfilling the law
[17:18] that's what the Bible says
[17:20] for this Thou shalt not commit adultery
[17:22] Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not steal
[17:24] Thou shalt not bear false witness Thou
[17:26] shalt not covet and if there be any
[17:28] other commandment it is briefly
[17:29] comprehended in this saying it's all
[17:31] summed up in this Thou shalt love thy
[17:35] neighbor as thyself see the reason
[17:37] people commit adultery is because they
[17:39] don't love they don't love the the
[17:40] person that they're that they're they're
[17:42] talking to they don't love that girl
[17:44] that they're lusting after they don't I
[17:45] mean I'm I don't mean like love like you
[17:47] want to get married to them but they
[17:48] don't they don't love them and as as
[17:50] part of like wanting to see them saved
[17:52] wanting to want to see their soul want
[17:54] them to see salvation the reason people
[17:57] kill is because they don't love the
[17:59] reason people steal is because they
[18:01] don't love the reason you know you talk
[18:03] about the sometimes the kids will go to
[18:05] camps and stuff and that somebody will
[18:06] steal their iPhone or steal something
[18:08] that was in their pocketbook the reason
[18:09] somebody does that is because they don't
[18:10] love they don't as a person as a
[18:13] Humanity they don't want to see them say
[18:14] they don't want the good for them they
[18:16] they they don't uh you know they don't
[18:19] value them as in their Humanity
[18:21] Thou shalt not bear false witness that's
[18:24] the reason people lies because they
[18:25] don't love thou shalt not covet they can
[18:28] covet to compare you know people say
[18:31] there's that saying that uh comparison
[18:33] is the is the thief of Joy when you
[18:35] covet something somebody else's God then
[18:37] your your joy is actually robbed and the
[18:40] reason that people covet the reason you
[18:42] want the car that the neighbors driving
[18:44] or something that somebody else has is
[18:46] because you don't love that's what I'm
[18:48] talking about that's what the the new
[18:50] birth gives you is love love to be able
[18:53] to love somebody else and when you love
[18:55] the the way that that that Paul is
[18:57] talking about here in Romans you are
[18:59] fulfilling the essence of the law love
[19:02] worketh no ill to his neighbor
[19:04] therefore love is the fulfilling of the
[19:09] law
[19:10] so in Galatians he says for Brethren you
[19:12] have been called unto Liberty only use
[19:14] not Liberty for an occasion to the flesh
[19:16] but by love serve one another
[19:19] for all the law
[19:21] all the law
[19:23] all the essence of the Old Testament law
[19:26] is fulfilled in this new covenant when
[19:29] Christ's life is put into the heart of
[19:31] the believer and you can love the way
[19:33] that God wanted you to from the
[19:35] beginning
[19:36] all the law was fulfilled in one word
[19:38] even in this Thou shalt love thy
[19:41] neighbor as thyself
[19:44] you know you know when you really think
[19:45] if you meditate on what that means that
[19:48] when somebody's going through a trial
[19:50] and maybe they slip up and fall you look
[19:52] at them with different eyes because you
[19:54] know I'm a human too and I'm going
[19:55] through stuff and I want somebody to
[19:57] give me Grace
[19:58] and you look at somebody and you because
[20:00] you love them you give them you give
[20:03] them a little more grace you give them
[20:05] you treat them a little bit differently
[20:07] because you realize we're we're all
[20:09] humans we're all trying to get to the
[20:11] same goal
[20:12] if you fulfill the Royal law James said
[20:15] according to the scripture Thou shalt if
[20:17] you fulfill the Royal law
[20:19] Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[20:23] ye do well
[20:26] you see you see how see how that's
[20:28] difficult to express there's no
[20:30] requirement to come to Christ there's
[20:32] nothing you have to do to work yourself
[20:34] up or something to come to Christ but
[20:35] after you come to Christ after you get
[20:38] in him it's going there's going to be
[20:40] something worked out from your members
[20:42] it's going what's what's put on display
[20:45] love the love of God
[20:48] and first John said hereby perceive we
[20:50] the love of God because he laid down his
[20:52] life for us and we ought to lay down our
[20:54] lives for the Brethren but whoso hath
[20:57] this world's good and see if his brother
[20:58] have need and shutteth up his bowels of
[21:01] compassion from him how dwelleth the
[21:03] love of God in him
[21:06] my little children let us not love and
[21:09] word neither in tongue but in deed and
[21:11] Truth
[21:12] in first John again John so many so much
[21:17] of what he talked about was about based
[21:18] on love because he loved Jesus Christ
[21:22] whosoever believeth that Jesus is the
[21:24] Christ is born of God and everyone that
[21:26] loveth him
[21:27] that began loveth him also that has
[21:32] begotten so if you love The Giver you're
[21:36] going to love those that received
[21:37] eternal life so if you love Jesus Christ
[21:40] you can't help but love me
[21:44] and you can't help but love one another
[21:46] because if you love Jesus you can't help
[21:49] but love those that have received him Oh
[21:52] by that should change our our attitudes
[21:54] this morning
[21:56] when you think about you know everybody
[21:58] in this building and maybe streaming it
[22:01] online
[22:02] loves God loves Jesus Christ and if
[22:05] you've received him you can't help but
[22:07] love one another
[22:08] by this we know
[22:12] that we love the children of God
[22:15] when we love God and keep his
[22:16] Commandments
[22:18] for this is the love of God that we keep
[22:21] his Commandments and his Commandments
[22:23] are not Grievous what what Commandments
[22:26] the 613 Commandments in the Old
[22:29] Testament that if you go back and read
[22:31] They're talking about how to be just to
[22:33] one another how to make good decisions
[22:35] they're not Grievous they're they're
[22:36] things that that you know just naturally
[22:40] we should just do to one another and
[22:42] when you've got the eternal life of God
[22:44] living in you it will become natural
[22:45] because as you eat the word you become
[22:48] the word and you you're actually
[22:49] becoming what God wanted you to be
[22:53] love is the fulfilling of the law
[22:55] brother Brown said in the brass serpent
[22:57] he said God has a law
[22:59] and that law is love God can't work
[23:02] against himself then if I love God
[23:04] correctly then I'm going to testify the
[23:06] truth about God if I'm in in love with
[23:08] him I've got a wife here's in the
[23:09] building God knows I love her well you
[23:11] know everything good and everything is
[23:12] going to be for my wife you know that
[23:14] sure just like your husband would be to
[23:16] you well now if we love God then my
[23:19] confidence becomes perfect in him as I
[23:22] love him now he can't break that law of
[23:25] Love see because it's in my heart now
[23:29] you think about on the left there I got
[23:31] what what is Love In First Corinthians
[23:34] 13 will tell you so you know right there
[23:36] at the top of the list of course we know
[23:38] brother Ryan said love is corrective
[23:39] love is corrective because when you're
[23:41] doing wrong level what love will
[23:43] straighten you out but love suffers
[23:45] alone it's a long suffering
[23:47] maybe sometimes you got children out in
[23:49] the world and and you realize what long
[23:51] suffering is because you but you're
[23:53] patient love love love will wait a while
[23:56] because it's love love is kind love is
[23:59] not always putting somebody down and
[24:01] saying well you ain't worth nothing and
[24:03] see I don't I don't like bullying and
[24:05] putting down because love love will lift
[24:08] you up love envious not want us not
[24:12] itself it's not puffed up
[24:15] because look what's love trying to do
[24:17] prefer your brother
[24:19] does not behave itself unseemly seeketh
[24:22] not her own is not easily provoked
[24:26] you can poke somebody with love but they
[24:29] won't slap you back
[24:31] because they love you
[24:33] think of no evil Rejoice at the nodded
[24:36] iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth
[24:39] beareth all things believeth all things
[24:42] hope is all things endureth all things
[24:45] and never fails love
[24:49] will never fail
[24:51] and that little brother said what love
[24:53] cast out Devils love why because love is
[24:57] the light I'm talking about real love
[24:59] agape love love is the life of God
[25:03] that's Zoe life that life will cast out
[25:06] Devils will you come in come home and
[25:08] your your kids are all running around
[25:11] you know your wife's in a tizzy and
[25:15] and everything that brother Brown said
[25:16] you just come home and you just start
[25:18] straightening things up and and showing
[25:21] a little bit love and and that's I think
[25:23] that's a lesson for all of us
[25:26] uh myself included because love
[25:30] uh a hand slapped up against the face or
[25:34] strong words many times fail but love
[25:36] will always win the day
[25:42] so Paul said in Hebrews chapter 9
[25:45] . what are we talking about we're
[25:46] talking about the law take that Old
[25:48] Testament law
[25:50] and putting it into the heart of the
[25:51] believer
[25:52] in a New Covenant that that law can be
[25:56] lived out in you
[25:58] then verily the first Covenant had also
[26:00] ordinances of divine service in a
[26:02] worldly Sanctuary for there was a
[26:04] tabernacle made the first wherein was
[26:06] the Candlestick and the table and the
[26:08] showbread which is called the sanctuary
[26:10] he's he's making a point you could see
[26:13] all these things in the natural
[26:15] but now we're talking about something
[26:17] spiritual
[26:19] and after the second Veil The Tabernacle
[26:21] which is called the holiest of all which
[26:23] had the golden sensor and the Ark of the
[26:25] Covenant overlaid around about what gold
[26:27] wearing was the golden pot that had
[26:29] Manna and Aaron's raw that bud it in the
[26:31] tables of the Covenant and over at the
[26:33] cherubimes of gold shout on The Mercy
[26:35] Seat of which we cannot now speak
[26:36] particularly
[26:38] all of those things represented
[26:40] something well what do they represent
[26:42] like like brother Louise and brother
[26:44] Wade have been breaking down the rod
[26:46] that budded that all all these things
[26:47] are speaking of the life of God and the
[26:50] believer that now you can eat of that
[26:52] manna that they that they that only the
[26:54] high priest could eat of now now you can
[26:56] you can enter in and eat of that now now
[26:59] you can have that eternal life with that
[27:01] rod budded and and you now those tables
[27:04] of stone are in the believer's heart now
[27:07] all of those things that were just
[27:08] Shadows of now we've got the reality of
[27:11] it in our lives
[27:13] in Hebrews chapter 9.
[27:15] now when these things were thus ordained
[27:18] in verse 6 he said no the priest went
[27:20] always into the first Tabernacle
[27:21] accomplishing the service of God but
[27:24] into the second went the high priest
[27:25] alone once every year not without blood
[27:27] which he offered for himself and for The
[27:30] Heirs of the people
[27:31] the Holy Ghost is signified
[27:34] it's about the Holy Ghost
[27:36] that the way into the holiest of all was
[27:39] not yet made manifest while is the first
[27:41] Tabernacle was yet standing
[27:44] which was a figure for the time then
[27:45] present in which we were offered both
[27:47] gifts and sacrifices that could not make
[27:50] him that did the service perfect as
[27:52] pertaining to the conscience if the
[27:55] musicians would go ahead and come
[27:56] forward
[27:57] which stood only in meats and drinks and
[28:00] diverse Washings
[28:01] and carnal ordinances imposed on them
[28:04] until the time of reformation we've got
[28:07] something that can change our conscience
[28:09] change our thinking but Christ being
[28:12] coming high priest of good things to
[28:13] come by greater and more perfect
[28:15] Tabernacle not made with hands that is
[28:18] to say not of this building neither by
[28:20] the blood of goats and cows calves but
[28:23] by his own blood he entered in once into
[28:26] the holy place
[28:28] having obtained Eternal Redemption for
[28:31] us
[28:32] what holy Place into your heart and
[28:35] we'll stop right there God bless you
[28:38] let's meditate on these things as we
[28:40] prepare for the service
[28:42] [Applause]
