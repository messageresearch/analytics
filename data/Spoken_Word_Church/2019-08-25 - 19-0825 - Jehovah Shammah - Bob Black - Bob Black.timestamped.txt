[0:04] now just a reminder to remember these
[0:09] this morning three superhero my little
[0:12] Burley is minister in Africa
[0:24] [Music]
[0:32] so everybody's so let's uh we're gonna
[0:41] tell obviously about it what was Sean
[0:43] mother's food but before we get into
[0:45] that let's just go a little different
[0:47] you'll regard we think you've got for
[0:49] your grace and mercy to us today Lord
[0:51] and I pray God to anise be with us all
[0:53] and open the word to us lord help us a
[0:56] little bit of home life journey afraid
[0:57] up to a little bit away sister Jude
[1:00] weather releases pristine but a fairly
[1:02] overhead ministry and all these the ones
[1:04] working for you for Jesus
[1:06] remember us to label of God pray that
[1:09] today we just don't know but not just
[1:10] any other suddenly but a special day for
[1:12] us for the workers because more more
[1:14] like Jesus
[1:18] brainania Jesus Christ Amy
[1:27] no Joe jehova shamma did one of the one
[1:31] of the compound dangers at home right it
[1:33] means like like a lot of the other
[1:35] compound names of Jehovah
[1:37] it's kind of hidden in scripture where
[1:38] it's not you know you think it might be
[1:40] spelled out where you could to see
[1:42] general was Shama but it's the the
[1:44] Hebrew of a scriptural reference to one
[1:50] of these attributes from done and this
[1:52] history of our secures in Ezekiel
[1:55] chapter 48 the very last last important
[1:59] of Ezekiel last chapter where Ezekiel
[2:01] kind of takes you 30 of you kind of read
[2:03] in Ezekiel 36 I'm talking about getting
[2:06] the new birth um and I think this is
[2:09] equal 37 that talks about the
[2:10] restoration the drive off with bones
[2:13] coming into being restored the
[2:17] restoration of vegetables the son of man
[2:19] Ezekiel 38 maybe the arm again and you
[2:22] can just keep following old up till we
[2:23] get to the last chapter in this book
[2:25] talks about well the last few chapters
[2:27] talks about this city that that Isaiah
[2:30] talked about the spoken over in
[2:31] Revelation the city that will be and it
[2:34] says here this last verse and the name
[2:37] of the city from that day shall be
[2:40] that's kind of
[2:42] see you gotta stop cheating they change
[2:52] something on you
[2:58] that's the mind of a second
[3:10] [Applause]
[3:46] No
[3:51] you could say you've been blessing the
[3:53] bed alright so so as Ethan was
[3:58] describing this city here in the last
[3:59] chapter and these are the ones out of
[4:01] the city and how the gates all are and
[4:03] all the different things and and kind of
[4:05] describing that he says it was around
[4:07] about eighteen eighteen thousand majors
[4:09] in the name of the city from that day
[4:10] shall be the Lord is there and that and
[4:14] if you look in the original Hebrew it's
[4:15] translated the original Hebrew is jehova
[4:18] shamma which means the Lord is there so
[4:21] what what what what I'm really getting
[4:23] at this morning is that the Lord has
[4:26] taken us through a process where the end
[4:28] of this process you can say the Lord is
[4:31] there and it really that's a almost you
[4:35] could say the difference between the
[4:36] revelation of that they had in the Old
[4:38] Testament and the Old Testament they
[4:40] could point at the tabernacle and say
[4:41] the Lord is there they could fall in a
[4:43] particular place and the Garden of Eden
[4:45] they could point say well the Lord is
[4:46] there they think and but now in the New
[4:49] Testament you you're looking at at a
[4:52] different abiding place I guess that we
[4:55] can say the Lord the Lord is the
[4:57] question is where is the Lord not the
[4:59] Lord as it is people exactly come on so
[5:08] the creatures that talk about the
[5:10] presence of the Lord that in some
[5:13] chapter forty states to the chief
[5:15] musician for the sons of korah says for
[5:16] God is our refuge and strength a very
[5:19] present help in trouble see all these
[5:22] things are kinda you can look at
[5:23] that's kind of under the umbrella of
[5:26] jehova shamma that he said he's there
[5:28] he's a president help just like he was
[5:30] there when Abraham off went went to
[5:32] offer his son Isaac he was there to
[5:34] provide a sacrifice he was there in his
[5:37] present and in Matthew 20 teaching them
[5:39] to observe all things whatsoever I have
[5:41] commanded you and lo I am with you
[5:43] always even unto the end of the world
[5:46] when he gives you the new birth ease
[5:47] they're constantly residing with you
[5:49] present with you always
[5:51] and he would just he's there to fight
[5:55] your battles he's there to take care of
[5:56] you then in Hebrews chapter 13 he says
[6:00] let your conversation be without
[6:01] covetousness and be content with such
[6:04] things as you have for he has said I
[6:06] will never leave thee nor forsake me so
[6:10] that we may boldly say the Lord is my
[6:12] helper now I will not fear what man
[6:15] shall do unto me do you think about what
[6:18] a comfort it is to know that God is
[6:21] there that he's with you that he's never
[6:23] gonna leave you easy
[6:24] he's abiding with you continually that
[6:27] no matter what obstacles and things that
[6:29] you go through he's there to help you
[6:31] and to see that you that you overcome to
[6:34] see you through this process
[6:38] but you know the just kind of adding a
[6:41] little contact before I get what I
[6:43] really want to do this morning it's kind
[6:45] of go through the tabernacle and the
[6:48] wilderness and go through the journey
[6:50] that it takes to get you into that into
[6:52] where you can say that that God is there
[6:54] he's abiding within me and look at all
[6:57] the different the different pieces of
[6:58] furniture just a high level overview
[7:01] there's so many things that you dive in
[7:03] the dependency in this journey of a
[7:06] believer but really the journey started
[7:09] when when our relationship with God was
[7:12] separable severed in the
[7:13] in the the relationship the way that it
[7:15] should be was severed in the Garden of
[7:17] Eden when Eve disbelieve one Word of God
[7:19] and the Bible says in Genesis chapter
[7:22] three so he drove out the man and he
[7:24] placed at the east of the Garden of Eden
[7:25] cherubims and a flaming sword which
[7:27] turned every way to keep the way of the
[7:29] Tree of Life in other words to keep man
[7:32] from from being able to fellowship with
[7:34] God in that way who was there was a
[7:36] barrier put up so that to prevent you
[7:39] the man from being able to eat because
[7:41] if he did if you really that you would
[7:43] live forever because the tree of life
[7:45] the Tree of Life is where we get our
[7:47] system is from and and so you know even
[7:53] even in the tabernacle you can see those
[7:55] terrible men the world leading to the
[7:57] veil opening to the curtain because now
[7:59] the thing that was driving the the thing
[8:02] that we're driving us away from the tree
[8:04] of life now is driving us back to the
[8:06] victory of life back to fellowship with
[8:08] God back to the true Fellowship so
[8:11] looking at the Garden of Eden
[8:13] I just kind of imagined for it where
[8:15] Adam and when he got driven driven out
[8:17] Adam and Eve got driven out of there out
[8:19] of the Garden of Eden just kind of an it
[8:21] tight maybe he look back and and
[8:22] remember that fellowship that he got to
[8:25] experience when you know the Bible talks
[8:27] about God coming down and the cool of
[8:28] the evening and fellowship when and
[8:30] sharing with him knowledge of himself
[8:32] and opening up the mysteries and talking
[8:35] to him about things and maybe Adam would
[8:37] look back and remember that fellowship
[8:40] that he couldn't get back to and so you
[8:43] say well maybe just kind of imagine
[8:46] wearing one of those God where is he now
[8:49] we get back to that fellowship so that's
[8:51] the question that that has been answered
[8:54] apps down through the ages and where is
[8:56] God and just to kind of put back in your
[8:59] mind what we're talking about is jehova
[9:00] shamma
[9:01] God is there the Lord is there so that's
[9:04] the answer to the question where is it
[9:06] who ever said
[9:07] show us the father it will suffice as he
[9:09] said and I would like to take four ways
[9:11] that we can see God and prove the
[9:13] gunner's right here in this building
[9:15] because that's you know that's the
[9:16] that's the role of the ministry it's to
[9:20] open the eyes of the people to the
[9:22] presence of a living God the reality
[9:24] that he is he is among us just open our
[9:28] eyes so that we could see him just like
[9:30] Elijah told to his servant he prayed to
[9:32] God that God would open up his eyes so
[9:35] that he could see the presence of God
[9:36] all around him that he was there ready
[9:39] to fight their battles and I believe
[9:42] that one of the reasons why we come to
[9:43] church is so that so that we can kind of
[9:46] be quickened with it will be stirred up
[9:48] a little bit to see that God is with us
[9:50] God is able to fight our battles in that
[9:53] God and his universe and God his word
[9:56] God in his son and God in his people so
[9:59] if want to know where God is God is in
[10:02] his people and don't wake Jesus forever
[10:07] said today that's what happens to the
[10:11] churches we talk about it we have so
[10:14] much intellectual Atilla men are so
[10:16] trained to the scripture so they can
[10:18] bring a message that will be can't lay a
[10:20] finger on it
[10:21] but where is God that's what I want to
[10:25] know where is that manifestation see
[10:28] that in other words in other words we're
[10:31] going through a process going through
[10:33] this what I'm going to get into talking
[10:34] about the tabernacle we're going through
[10:36] a process and the process
[10:39] to have a a supernatural understanding
[10:43] of God we want to be able to seek our
[10:45] who he is and now I'm talking about it
[10:47] it's good and and you know a lot of
[10:50] explanations good oratory all that's
[10:53] good but we're all I think everybody
[10:55] from the bottom to the top the young
[10:57] people that old people everybody is is
[11:00] hungry and thirsty to see God make
[11:02] manifest in their life right so the
[11:08] question where is God and brother my
[11:10] brother man
[11:12] man you in Matthew chapter 24 it says
[11:14] this this very premise scripture that
[11:16] brother Wayne and all the different
[11:18] ministers have been speaking all the
[11:20] different times then defeating Beata
[11:22] sayin that you lo here is Christ or
[11:24] there believe it not for there shall
[11:27] arise false Christ's and false prophets
[11:30] that shall show great signs and wonders
[11:31] it's so much that if it were possible
[11:33] they shall deceive the very elect the
[11:35] whole life told you before wherefore if
[11:38] they shall say unto you behold he is in
[11:40] the desert go not for behold he is in
[11:43] the secret chambers believe it not
[11:45] because why because you've got a
[11:47] revelation of
[11:49] jehova shamma you know where he is and
[11:52] where is he and that's this where I'm
[11:55] going you're gonna do the same way into
[11:57] the secret chain because he's saying if
[12:00] somebody says there's a secret chamber
[12:02] where you go find God for a particular
[12:05] church or a particular place that you
[12:07] can go don't believe it because you
[12:09] should have an understanding that God is
[12:11] living inside that that is where he is
[12:14] that's where Java Shama the Lord is
[12:17] there in that place
[12:18] so in the Old Testament the residing
[12:23] place of God was in that secret chamber
[12:25] of the Holy of Holies and at court
[12:27] corsican PO we know that he can manifest
[12:30] himself to Joshua with a man with a
[12:33] sword drawn in his hand and all those
[12:35] kind of things coming someone you know
[12:37] no I don't get
[12:37] he was constrained by like that little
[12:41] box that he was only I only living in
[12:43] that place but that was where the
[12:45] Israelites that was where Jonah in the
[12:47] belly of the whale and look to that holy
[12:49] polling says the the type of where God
[12:52] was making himself manifested so when
[12:55] they were following that that pillar of
[12:57] fire through the wilderness a pillar of
[12:59] fire wasn't manifested over that holy of
[13:01] holies that over that part of the
[13:03] Covenant where the word was but in the
[13:05] New Testament you he's he's not residing
[13:09] in that little place anymore he's
[13:10] residing and inside of your heart and
[13:13] not in that secret chamber of the Old
[13:15] Testament but in the secret chamber of
[13:18] your heart is where he's residing where
[13:21] he's seated on that mercy seat on the
[13:22] seat of your heart you see and and so
[13:25] but but looking back to the Old
[13:27] Testament you can get an understanding
[13:28] of where you are positionally by looking
[13:32] at the journey of the high priest as he
[13:34] went through the tabernacle so that's
[13:37] what we're going to do
[13:38] secret chamber means it up in the Greek
[13:41] lexicon Amin's a storage chamber or an
[13:45] inner chamber a secret room and and you
[13:48] can see that the presence of the
[13:50] nullifier this picture this hanging
[13:52] upstairs outside of the sanctuary that
[13:55] you know just imagine the Torah visually
[13:59] looking at that knowing that God was in
[14:02] their presence jehova shamma that the
[14:05] Lord is there and I believe in the New
[14:09] Testament that's got to be the
[14:11] revelation that the revelation of Jesus
[14:13] Christ personally to you that God is
[14:15] residing in your heart that he is there
[14:18] that you have a confidence that he is
[14:20] there because of the Old Testament
[14:22] donto losses he said let them make me a
[14:25] sanctuary that I'll make dwell
[14:28] according to all that I shall show thee
[14:30] after the pattern of the tabernacle and
[14:32] pattern of all the instruments they're
[14:33] looking so sexy making such how you make
[14:35] it big God wanted to dwell among them
[14:38] but now in the New Testament swelling in
[14:41] us and so you can see let's look at this
[14:45] picture of the tower I just want to show
[14:47] because of some different views of it so
[14:49] you can see that is its root actually
[14:51] really simple
[14:52] it's really plain in this construction
[14:55] but it's it showed this this is the
[14:58] pattern the pattern of how a believer
[15:01] would come into fellowship with God and
[15:03] in the Old Testament they really didn't
[15:06] know that even understand all of the
[15:08] hidden meaning of the things that all of
[15:10] the different the worship that they were
[15:13] going through as a you know Bart was
[15:15] sacrificing and went into the high
[15:17] priest went into the Holy of Holies
[15:19] but now the New Testament we can look
[15:21] back at whether it be much deeper
[15:23] understanding and really see what all
[15:26] these things mean so just kind of a
[15:31] layout of the tabernacle you really you
[15:34] could make it by the time you leave this
[15:36] morning you could have memorized all the
[15:38] different vessels that were in the
[15:40] tabernacle because you're coming maybe
[15:42] sometimes in your hand you think well
[15:43] there was so much going on but there was
[15:46] really only five or six vessels to and
[15:49] outside three of them in
[15:51] placing and and just one one piece of
[15:55] furniture and the Holy of Holies so
[15:58] you've got two pieces that offer the
[16:00] labor and then in the holy place the
[16:02] lampstand the table of shewbread and the
[16:04] altar of incense and then once you go
[16:06] past that veil you're into the Holy of
[16:10] Holies with the the cherubim the Ark of
[16:13] the Covenant and the mercy seat that
[16:16] table of stone and all of those things
[16:18] say you see the believer is taking the
[16:20] journey dark the tabernacle was facing
[16:23] eastward so you would be taking a
[16:25] journey westward just like the the
[16:29] revelation of Jesus Christ has gone from
[16:32] the east to the west you're taking a
[16:35] journey and westward into the kids of
[16:37] fellowship with God and what I think
[16:40] brother a moment hey he really opened to
[16:43] us our understanding that these three
[16:45] these three components are speaking of
[16:48] justification sanctification and the
[16:51] Baptist with all the goods and that's
[16:54] really the foundation of what we believe
[16:57] even so much that in we're gonna round
[17:01] preach the future home when he talked
[17:03] about how the earth is going through
[17:05] that same journey of justification
[17:07] sanctification the defenses with all the
[17:10] girls
[17:10] hey and you know many times we can kind
[17:13] of get in our head well this is very
[17:14] simple teaching but this is this is
[17:16] actually how we how we journey up the
[17:19] statue of a perfect man this is how we
[17:21] actually become close to the guys it's
[17:24] more than just the new birth just
[17:26] there's more to this than just when you
[17:29] just go through justification your sins
[17:30] we chopped off you go to the saint
[17:32] feature a little hole a lot and then you
[17:33] get
[17:34] there's more for this than just the new
[17:37] person that I but I believe that when we
[17:39] kind of get into this a little bit there
[17:41] that's one of the purposes of the
[17:43] fivefold ministry to identify the people
[17:45] to by the preaching of the gospel that
[17:47] there's more there's more to this than
[17:49] just being born again and there's more
[17:52] of this and then just the simplicity of
[17:55] say there's more to it there's a
[17:58] mysterious part of going through this
[18:01] process that unfolds as you grow and the
[18:04] knowledge of the word so justification
[18:10] of sanctification baptismal goes and we
[18:12] get that from Ezekiel 36 that says I
[18:14] will take you through a moment either
[18:16] the nowhere that's a my coming up
[18:17] they don't even he doesn't even know
[18:20] anything about the gospel they come up
[18:21] they hear about the word they come up
[18:23] with the that that like the first door
[18:26] to the tabernacle and and they come in
[18:29] and the priests are offering sacrifices
[18:31] and they're wondering about what's going
[18:33] on and and they begin to go through this
[18:35] journey and he says then I will sprinkle
[18:37] clean water upon you and you shall be
[18:39] clean from all your filthiness and
[18:41] here's the three stages a new heart walk
[18:43] along give you and a new spirit while I
[18:45] put within you and I will take away the
[18:47] stony heart out of your flesh and I will
[18:49] give you an
[18:50] which and I will put my spirit within
[18:52] you and cause you to walk in my statutes
[18:54] and you shall keep my judgments and duty
[18:57] and so you can take each one of those
[18:59] steps and apply it to a different part
[19:02] of going through that Tabernacle does
[19:04] that make sense
[19:05] you see in the Old Testament the
[19:16] tabernacle was where God abided but in
[19:19] the New Testament God is dwelling in you
[19:22] which that we could see in 2nd
[19:23] Corinthians chapter 6 be not unequally
[19:26] yoked together with unbelievers for what
[19:28] fellowship hath wrought righteousness
[19:30] with unrighteousness and what communion
[19:32] hath light with darkness and what
[19:35] Concord hath Christ with Belial or what
[19:38] part hath he that believeth with an
[19:39] infidel and what agreement hath the
[19:41] temple of God with idols for ye are the
[19:44] Temple of the Living God as God hath
[19:46] said I will dwell in them and walk in
[19:48] them and I will be their God and they
[19:50] shall be my people see I think I think
[19:52] that kind of informs the way that we
[19:54] live our life if you realize that God is
[19:56] Tabernacle inside of you it will change
[19:58] the way that you approach other people
[19:59] the way that you deal with problems the
[20:02] way that you you know even talking about
[20:07] the younger one
[20:08] you get some money to realize that God
[20:11] wants to tabernacle itself himself
[20:14] inside of you and literally let your
[20:16] hands and use your eyes to talk to other
[20:18] people to help help their other burdens
[20:21] and and it puts you into service that
[20:23] kind of changes our approach a little
[20:25] bit 1st Corinthians chapter 16 and
[20:28] talking to the Corinthians that were
[20:29] that we're not really you know they were
[20:32] maybe maybe a really good example of
[20:35] people who did not realize maybe the
[20:37] extent that God wanted to live inside
[20:38] them he said no you're not they you're
[20:40] the temple of God the Spirit of God
[20:42] dwelleth in you If any man to follow the
[20:45] temple of God him shall God destroy for
[20:47] the temple of God is holy which temple
[20:49] you are and so if we are the temple then
[20:56] the temples gotta be filled right so
[20:59] that's what all scripture talks about
[21:01] building its employees go back in and
[21:03] look read about suitable building the
[21:06] temple after they came out of the
[21:07] Babylonian destruction in Ephesians
[21:13] chapter 2
[21:15] that's what Paul was talking about we
[21:17] are built upon the foundation of the
[21:19] apostles and prophets Jesus Christ
[21:21] Himself being the chief Cornerstone and
[21:23] whom all the building fitly framed
[21:25] together groweth unto an holy temple in
[21:27] the Lord and he also are builded
[21:30] together for an habitation of God
[21:31] through the spirit another skip through
[21:35] that is to not save time to let me
[21:39] that plus creeping Hill me but all of
[21:44] this is tempted to kind of give the
[21:46] church to to get the believer to a place
[21:48] to to realize that God is a body so
[21:55] brother Rama and Christ the mystery God
[21:57] reveal said what is the new birth in you
[22:00] say well brother Branham what is the
[22:01] Negro it is the revelation of Jesus
[22:04] Christ personally to you I believe that
[22:06] revelation is the revelation of Jehovah
[22:08] Shalom that he is there living inside of
[22:11] unity because when he reveals himself to
[22:13] you begins to open up the word and
[22:15] transforms your life giving gives you
[22:17] overcoming power the power of the devil
[22:21] in 1955 over I'm said except the more
[22:23] man be born again you cannot understand
[22:25] the kingdom of heaven there's no way of
[22:27] understanding it until you're born again
[22:29] and then God reveals himself to you and
[22:32] then you know that you've passed from
[22:34] death unto life because no man can call
[22:36] Jesus to Christ only by the whole
[22:39] experience so looking at this this this
[22:43] picture of the tabernacle again we got
[22:46] one three four five six six pieces of
[22:51] furniture in this that described the
[22:54] believers journey through the tabernacle
[22:57] now what one reason not only kind of
[22:59] stressed the importance of this is you
[23:00] know as the word begins open up when we
[23:03] preach a lot of times about how we're
[23:04] you know we're we're almost like
[23:06] everybody is in the Holy of Holies and
[23:08] we preached it or look at it another way
[23:11] everybody is in maybe not just a new
[23:14] growth experience but everybody it
[23:16] always come up to the capstone but
[23:18] that's not necessarily that's not the
[23:20] case I'm not gonna say necessarily the
[23:22] case I think we we can be convinced that
[23:25] everybody is at different levels so when
[23:29] you have the minister and whatever
[23:30] appreciate from whatever
[23:31] position they are when we preach it the
[23:35] son of man is being revealed today God
[23:38] is in flesh and those kind of things but
[23:39] but that might not be the truth for you
[23:42] yet if you're still going through this
[23:45] process and so a lot of times people can
[23:48] get they get all stirred up and say well
[23:49] I'm already at an adoption or where I'm
[23:52] already had this placement but to know
[23:54] that you're at the wherever you are you
[23:56] have to identify yourself with these
[23:59] different markers with these different
[24:01] places that identify the place that you
[24:04] have gone through the journey that
[24:05] you've known through like life went up
[24:08] when ruthless was talking to Oster our
[24:11] mother lost tour marked the place where
[24:14] boa has lives and marked the place
[24:16] because when you mark the place where it
[24:19] could come from then you can kind of you
[24:21] can have an idea where you are and your
[24:23] spiritual growth moves on you could have
[24:26] you can have an understanding where you
[24:28] are the stench your perfect man or if
[24:30] you're 48 or if you're not more you know
[24:31] kind of where you are in this journey
[24:33] because at each of these places
[24:36] something is happening in the life of a
[24:38] believer so you know you've got three
[24:43] stages of your experience this your
[24:46] experience because a lot of times we're
[24:49] going to looking at somebody else's
[24:50] experience they try to place where they
[24:52] are but you know when the high priest
[24:53] went into the Holy of Holies he can only
[24:55] go behind himself and with God has made
[24:58] us kings and priests and when you make
[25:00] this dirty as a priest you you're making
[25:03] it alone you're going through the outer
[25:06] corner for Holy of Holies by yourself
[25:09] and the only the only way that you can
[25:11] measure where you are in this journey is
[25:13] by looking into the world from the outer
[25:15] form to the holy place until the Holy of
[25:18] Holies
[25:21] so I know maybe this sometimes this Gila
[25:25] can be a little bit mysterious and
[25:27] everything but I just kind of want to
[25:28] some like one scripture a little bit and
[25:31] look more at maybe some some strange
[25:34] ways that Paul talked about some of
[25:37] these things because in Romans chapter 8
[25:39] 29 he says moreover whom he did
[25:41] predestinate them he also called and
[25:43] whom he called them he also justified
[25:45] and whom he justified them he also
[25:47] glorified you see there's a mysterious
[25:50] part of justification there's a
[25:52] mysterious part of sanctification that
[25:54] we can seep in and begin to understand
[25:56] by looking at this at this tabernacle
[25:58] picture and the third seal brother n
[26:01] said just take this like ticket on the
[26:04] other side that was people come in who
[26:05] has that power as kings there was a
[26:07] king's you have to notice the Bible turn
[26:08] the terminology of anything now watch
[26:11] but the reason all the strain ian's of
[26:13] the mysterious part of our justification
[26:15] the mysterious part of sanctification
[26:17] the mysterious part of the baptism it
[26:20] only goes oh all of these come and he's
[26:22] talking about this mysterious part
[26:24] what's the mysterious part and the power
[26:27] of transformation Bertram said now that
[26:30] we have been saved as we are and that we
[26:35] have been filled with the Holy Spirit as
[26:37] we have now we want the mind that was in
[26:41] Christ to be in us that we might be
[26:45] transformed from the natural things of
[26:47] life and we brought in to do the perfect
[26:50] will of God by transformation of God's
[26:54] Spirit by His Word in other words after
[26:57] you go through justification
[27:00] sanctification of the Baptist in the
[27:01] Holy Ghost and your soul is residing in
[27:03] harmony with God your soul has been made
[27:06] eternal that's not the end of the story
[27:09] there's more to it and the mysterious
[27:12] part is that now you've got power to
[27:15] overcome now keep rolling growing and
[27:18] paint let the Word of God transform your
[27:21] mind so there's a lot more to this than
[27:24] just the simplicity of justification
[27:27] sanctification back to the Holy Ghost so
[27:37] we start off at this broth at this
[27:39] brazen altar because we're justified by
[27:43] faith in in the work that Jesus already
[27:46] did for us and that's why this is the
[27:49] very first thing the very first thing is
[27:52] you coming in a sacrifice had to be made
[27:54] when you come in to the tabernacle when
[27:57] you come into that brazen office the
[27:59] very first thing you see and you've got
[28:01] to get that taken care of first because
[28:06] our report is justification so you're
[28:09] repeating exactly if you you're looking
[28:17] at the sacrifice that Jesus made for you
[28:19] and and believing that and identifying
[28:24] yourself with it like like for example
[28:26] rogram set a table not only you know
[28:29] tae-hee offered up that Lana Manette
[28:31] altar and he crawled up there with it
[28:34] this kind of is his story for him to
[28:36] identify himself whether he laid his own
[28:39] life on that altar so see this altar
[28:42] represents more maybe than just Jesus
[28:44] offering up this sacrifice but the
[28:47] Israelites they would continue the green
[28:49] that would bring in their wheat offering
[28:51] and we constantly offering up things
[28:53] offering up themselves it's pretty like
[28:55] that they were constantly as part of
[28:58] their worship when you come to church
[29:00] your sacrifice into the Lord when you
[29:03] want any kind of when you get up in the
[29:05] morning and you don't feel like I'm in a
[29:06] church or coming to Bible study or going
[29:08] to the fellowship meetings or fellowship
[29:09] when your brothers or sisters you're
[29:10] making a sacrifice because the whole
[29:13] Christian journey is based upon
[29:14] sacrifice name it's based upon you God
[29:18] died for you and now you become a
[29:20] prisoner of Christ you've died to
[29:22] yourself so that God can live inside you
[29:24] assume the first part of your eternity
[29:28] is to recognize that Jesus died for you
[29:30] and have confidence in that and see
[29:33] every other part of this of the
[29:36] tabernacle is based upon upon that when
[29:39] you when you go into the golden offer in
[29:42] the hole the only place to burn incense
[29:44] you got to take fire from this altar to
[29:47] burn incense on that offer so everything
[29:50] starts with this offer everything is
[29:52] based upon your faith in what Jesus has
[29:55] done for you that course you know
[29:57] program if you come back to listen to
[29:58] the sermon into the Intervale and he
[30:01] talks about how you cannot you don't
[30:03] come to God based upon like it's crying
[30:05] and screaming and all this thing that's
[30:07] based upon of the your faith in what
[30:09] Jesus has already done free so the
[30:12] brazen offer is the first of many
[30:15] vessels every vessel had its role just
[30:18] like every believer in the church has a
[30:20] roll they have to fulfill every vessel
[30:23] in this sanctuary had a different hats
[30:26] like like waypoints through the journey
[30:28] of a believer it was lit by the fire of
[30:31] God to show that the sacrifice was
[30:33] accepted and and everything everything
[30:36] was based upon that it's virus collected
[30:38] the varnish that's only golden offer in
[30:40] the blood of the sacrifice you sprinkled
[30:42] on the mercy seat and so then you come
[30:48] to this to this this labor or the
[30:53] washing place where the word is it
[30:56] begins to wash you and cleanse you
[30:58] because you've got to be washed before
[31:00] you can go into the holy place now
[31:02] there's a labor this labor signifies a
[31:04] lot of different things that signifies
[31:06] the washing of the word that signifies
[31:07] that you don't you baptize of course
[31:09] you're not you're not saved because you
[31:11] were baptized but a believer is good be
[31:13] identified with Jesus Christ in those so
[31:16] you're going to go down in the water
[31:18] because you want to go be identified in
[31:20] the death of the death burial and
[31:23] resurrection of Jesus Christ because the
[31:25] scripture say this repent and be
[31:27] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[31:28] Christ and it's kind
[31:34] [Music]
[31:35] let's dig some of it see after the offer
[31:42] before the door is delayed and after
[31:46] watching for the priest after washing
[31:48] their hands of the feet did the priest
[31:50] can minister at the altar of the holy
[31:52] place or the holy place so you got you
[31:55] better have faith in the sacrifice that
[31:57] Jesus died for you first then get
[32:00] cleansed and then you can go into
[32:02] service and they have to watch every
[32:04] time they entered it was a continual
[32:07] washing just like the word is
[32:09] continually cleansing the believer the
[32:10] the Bible says in John 15:3 now you are
[32:13] clean to the word without spoken to any
[32:16] Titus 3 5 6 is not by works of
[32:18] righteousness which we have done but
[32:20] according to His mercy he saved us by
[32:22] the washing of regeneration and renewing
[32:24] of the Holy Ghost in Hebrews 10:22 says
[32:26] let us draw near with a true heart in
[32:29] full assurance of faith having our
[32:31] hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience
[32:32] and our bodies washed with pure water
[32:34] and we know of course and that's also
[32:36] speaking of that the ashes of the red
[32:38] heifer that will sprinkle on the
[32:40] believer to purify them which which also
[32:44] types the word the red heifer being a
[32:46] perfect sacrifice being sprayed on the
[32:49] believer so there's there's so many
[32:50] different times but but also speaking
[32:53] that labor speaking of being baptized
[32:55] because as priests unto God we must be
[32:57] first baptized confess our sins and be
[33:00] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[33:01] watching you our sins and then you shall
[33:04] receive you
[33:05] the gift of the Holy Ghost lost first
[33:07] and then anointed for the service but
[33:10] then you have a right to enter into the
[33:12] holy place where you you're entering
[33:14] into a sanctified condition and this is
[33:16] where you know it can kind of get a lot
[33:20] of times people stagnate in this in this
[33:22] place because there's a lot going home
[33:26] in the holy place there's more furniture
[33:28] here than there is any other in any
[33:30] other part of the tabernacle and you're
[33:33] living a holy life you're living a play
[33:35] a life where you're looking into the
[33:36] Bible come on now that's a blessing into
[33:41] some deep understanding the Bible says
[33:53] in John 17:17 is sanctify them through
[33:56] thy truth thy Word is truth
[33:57] in Ephesians 5:25 says husband's love
[34:00] your wives even as Christ also loved the
[34:02] church and gave himself for it
[34:03] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[34:06] with the washing of water by the word
[34:08] and so you're clear that when you're in
[34:10] there in that holy place you're eating
[34:12] the work because you've got there's the
[34:13] table of shewbread on the right when
[34:15] you're either in the table of showbread
[34:16] setup and what is the table of showbread
[34:18] as you study in the Bible it's the word
[34:21] laying out on the table and we gather
[34:23] around at that table we fellowship over
[34:25] the word and we ask questions like a
[34:27] Bible study we come to Bible study where
[34:29] we're sitting over this we're feasting
[34:31] on that on that table of showbread
[34:33] because the showbread was reserved only
[34:35] for the priests but we have been made
[34:39] kings and priests so we know a right to
[34:42] iterate like David who ate the showbread
[34:44] which was not lawful for just anybody to
[34:46] eat except the priests why was David
[34:48] allowed to lead the celebrating because
[34:50] it's a type of you and I going in there
[34:53] maybe you're not a minister or anything
[34:55] but still you have a right to eat that
[34:56] word of God you have a right to eat of
[34:59] this because God has made by the
[35:00] sacrifice of Jesus Christ he's made a
[35:02] way
[35:03] be able to enter in and partake of these
[35:05] things that in the Old Testament worship
[35:07] reserved only for the priests the table
[35:10] display the Twitter loaves of bread that
[35:12] were prepared every Sabbath the type of
[35:14] Christ killing eaten by the priests and
[35:16] John chapter 6 35 Jesus said I am the
[35:19] bread of life
[35:20] he that cometh to me shall never hunger
[35:21] and he that believeth on me shall never
[35:23] thirst I am The Living bread which came
[35:26] down from God out of heaven If any man
[35:27] any of this bread he shall live forever
[35:29] and the bread that I will give is my
[35:31] flesh which I will give for the life of
[35:33] the world and so and then you've got on
[35:36] the left-hand side you've got the
[35:38] candlesticks the seven golden
[35:39] candlesticks which we're sitting there
[35:41] and brother Adam talked about in the
[35:42] interval and other messages how and the
[35:44] outer core the light of the Sun or the
[35:46] moon depending whether it's day or night
[35:48] will give you light it can get dark at
[35:51] night and out of court and so there's
[35:53] not it's changing same thing in the only
[35:56] place you've got a different you've got
[35:58] like a there's a is it a ire form of
[36:02] life but still it's not a permanent life
[36:05] like you get in the holy people in the
[36:07] Holy of Holies that's a light that has
[36:09] to be continuously maintained sometimes
[36:11] they can go out and get smoke and you
[36:13] got to trim those lamps but see that's
[36:15] what and the only place sometimes we get
[36:18] really excited when we go for a bomb or
[36:20] something we get out we go to special
[36:22] meetings and we get all pumped up and
[36:23] everything in the light it's really
[36:25] burning bright but then when we come
[36:26] back in the world it gets all smoky and
[36:28] everything and we're like that what well
[36:30] I feel down everything you got going
[36:32] there and trim the lamp and everything
[36:34] and kind of keep everything maintained
[36:35] but that light is different than the
[36:38] light that is in the Holy of Holies
[36:39] which is the Shekinah glory a permanent
[36:42] light that's always shining so you see
[36:44] in the golden lampstand one it's shown
[36:46] on that table of shewbread so there's a
[36:48] light shining on that
[36:49] you're eating in that holy place it
[36:51] gives light to the word now what it is
[36:53] this your light and your testimony is
[36:55] are going through that sanctified
[36:57] condition which like you said could be
[36:59] could be you're not moving it in but it
[37:01] could be you have been going in and
[37:04] you're going up the Statue of a perfect
[37:06] magnet
[37:06] you're going up to that of the second
[37:09] the second pole but it must be kept
[37:11] trimmed and maintaining the Psalm 27 the
[37:14] Lord is my light and my salvation whom
[37:16] shall I fear the Lord is the strength of
[37:18] my life of whom shall I be afraid and
[37:20] Ephesians chapter 5 says for he were
[37:22] sometimes darkness but now are ye light
[37:24] in the world walk as children of light
[37:27] and brother said best to the man who
[37:30] quits his drinking twist his smoker
[37:33] twist line quit stealing treats his
[37:36] neighbor right good to his wife are good
[37:38] to her hooking the same way men and
[37:39] woman the believer he's come into a
[37:41] place where he split out of his meanness
[37:43] which is through the blood of
[37:45] sanctification he's called to a new life
[37:47] and he's walked and he walks in there
[37:50] but you're not hid away if you're not
[37:53] behind the veil depending where you are
[37:56] that could mean different than that
[37:59] means different things because there's a
[38:02] mysterious part of justification there's
[38:04] a mysterious part of sanctification and
[38:06] maybe that's something to ponder on what
[38:09] does that mean see before you're born
[38:15] again you you you quit your smoking and
[38:19] there's a light this shining out from
[38:21] that holy place of the life there's a a
[38:24] light a light of a good sanctified life
[38:26] shining out but yet you have not yet
[38:29] entered into the
[38:30] holy place and then he talks about how
[38:35] you got you got to keep it real and you
[38:37] can't get all smoky and everything and
[38:39] then we come to the golden altar it's a
[38:43] very interesting piece of furniture the
[38:46] golden officers when you burn the
[38:47] incense on the bottle always types with
[38:50] prayer because when you pray you're
[38:54] confessing was hard to happen on that
[38:55] altar that brazen altar outside a lot of
[38:58] people think that prayer is like begging
[39:00] and everything that prayer is your
[39:01] confession of your faith before God will
[39:03] read the second samuel where the way
[39:05] that they would prayed was he said do
[39:07] according to your promises he didn't
[39:10] come into the bed is screaming and clean
[39:12] like a little child he came in with
[39:14] authority no one that he who he believed
[39:16] because he need to look back to that
[39:18] brazen altar and he knew that god that
[39:21] there was a sacrifice laying on that
[39:23] altar that's why you cannot maybe have a
[39:26] nabob who came into there and owned that
[39:28] gold and off they tried to burn a
[39:30] strange fire instead of taking from the
[39:32] fire off of the brazen altar they tried
[39:34] to burn a fire that they had done from
[39:36] somewhere else but if you think if you
[39:39] take the revelation of the faith that
[39:41] you know that Jesus Christ has died for
[39:43] you and put it on that altar and let
[39:46] that go up as a sweet savour before the
[39:49] Lord and then he'll hear your prayer it
[39:52] was offered after the morning at eat
[39:54] these sacrifices the incense on that
[39:55] golden offer and and they mixed up that
[39:58] incident I did I put a note here though
[39:59] don't hurry when you offer it when
[40:01] you're offering up your ago you're
[40:02] innocent you take time to mix it up real
[40:05] good
[40:05] take time to you come before that own
[40:09] offering favorite but you like you know
[40:10] a lot of people say well I don't need I
[40:12] don't need to spend any time in prayer
[40:13] they think it they get that it's like
[40:16] almost like saying that they have
[40:18] nothing to be thankful for they have
[40:20] nothing to praise God for that they have
[40:23] don't have time to
[40:25] to confess to the Lord what they believe
[40:28] that he has done for them so when you
[40:30] get alone with God and you begin to
[40:32] speak back to him the things that he's
[40:34] already said then that gives an
[40:35] opportunity for him to speak back to you
[40:37] so don't don't worry mix-up that is take
[40:39] time the big study in cents up your
[40:41] Thanksgiving and your praise and your
[40:43] prayer which is your product confession
[40:45] before God let my prayer in subchapter

[41:17] certainly that server establish it
[41:20] forever and do as thou has seen that's
[41:23] how we pray and in Revelation chapter 8
[41:26] and the smoke of the incense which came
[41:27] with the prayers of the Saints ascended
[41:29] up before God out of the Angels hand and
