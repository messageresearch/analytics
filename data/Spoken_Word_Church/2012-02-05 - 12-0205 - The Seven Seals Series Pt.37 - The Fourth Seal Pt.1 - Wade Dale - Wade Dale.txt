========================================

all right we're going to start on the fourth seal one two and three is finished we're gonna start on number four turn into revelation chapter six thank brother bob for carrying on the last two just do classic and probably we'll hear some more from the group a little bit later on because after the uh i don't like that rib after the uh valentine's i'm getting my thoughts together here after the valentine's banquet i'm going to be doing several sunday services so you'll be hearing them down here um later on starting on february the probably the 25th bob i'll let you know on the 24th okay actually i'll let you know on the 24th that gives you to the 26th okay but i think we'll let uh joe and brother donny we'll do a week there and then then bob we'll just kind of rotate them out because i'll probably be taking most of march because we're going to brother ron spencer's on the 23rd 24th 25th and 26th for a little vacation and preaching for him up there so visiting the people need more help yeah ryan's in there i don't know we're just we're saving him he's a rookie silver you know he's picking on bob right now we red shirted him we red shirted him be the freshman and uh i gotta still pick on bob i can't start picking on ryan yet so but we're going to try to take this for seal and go through it pretty quick and not spend a lot of time on it maybe a couple of two or three time so revelation chapter 6 when opened the fourth seal i heard the voice of the fourth beast say come and see look and behold a pale horse and his name that set on him was death and hell followed with it and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword and with hunger and with death and with the beast of the earth now let's turn to matthew and catch the uh where jesus was talking on the speaking on the seals itself matthew 24. we know that verse four and five is the first seal six is the second seventh verse is the third seal and here we are in the fourth seal which will be verse nine matthew 24 9. then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake all right there's the fourth seal now let's get our symbols real quick the fourth steal of course we got matthew 24 9 powell was given to him to white to take to kill with a sword and hunger death and the beast symbol was a pale horse which is what white red and black mixed together all right he had a name his name was death he was not named now remember he was death back here in the first seal he was death in the second death in the third right but in the fourth steal he gets a name all right the combat beast is the eagle and the eagle anointing is the only way that this person can be brought to light or be exposed in the end time because no other wesley luther they never could they couldn't preach the seals and know that the cells were the very antichrist that was working in their own in their own system all right but god had a true he had a true bride through all those church ages but in this age which is the seventh age is the parallel the fourth seal because why what was the combat beast eagle after the eagle is there any other combat thing no no more combat beats so brother branham knew then he see he was on that fourth seal when he gets to the fifth seal he looks back on the fourth steal showing that the rapture takes place on the fourth seal all right now people go bonkers and cuckoo over there but just let's keep it in line four combat beats four writers white black white red black and pale they ate the word down so much right go back to joel joel says i will restore what the cankerworm palm worm caterpillar locust which was the four beasts or horse riders that rode out in opposition to the four that was going to bring it back all right which was the lion the ox the man and the eagle all right everybody got that so i mean it ought to be we ought to know these things but that's okay we got a lot of new ones so so we need to go slow we'll we'll go a little bit slower but you don't see any more combat beasts because we're going to maybe next sunday we're going to go into the book of ezekiel and watch what they did and watch what happened those those combat beasts went up and you see a man son of man all right he said well how do you get four if if four he did it down four had to restore it he said well what's the four you know brother that was hitting on it he's making quotes because he's headed towards him he's making comments justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost and the word the word had to be restored the holy ghost was restored to a degree it was a down payment remember the earnest of our inheritance in ephesians the baptism of the holy ghost is your earnest but that's not the full possession the full possession is when we all get nothing when the fourth or the eagle comes on the same reveals god to the people like never before and shows that we can take a body change the other ones couldn't do that but it shows the eagle had to go higher to see things to show us what all these names are and how they all fit together so the rapture takes place in the fourth seal but it takes all seven to go in the rapture right with the change of the body takes all seven one two three four the rapture justification baptism holy ghost and the word that's full restoration back to power all right but then there's five six and seven which we'll get into and that's why i want to get to four and then i'll have this gap where i'll be you know teaching some on sundays upstairs on a different subject but i want five six and seven is very important seal very important seal so we may take and just take a little time and let's coast a little bit and let these other brothers come in and they're all doing a wonderful job as far as i'm concerned teaching you sunday school that's what this is sunday school not preaching this teaching sunday school class and they're doing a very good job but then we'll start when i get a little more time maybe in april when i'm not going anywhere we'll take three four five maybe months and go through five six and seven but if you get one two three and four let's get those down because that takes us interactive the thing of it is the holy ghost was not yeah the holy ghost was not eat down it was the word right then you don't eat the holy ghost it was just covered up because there wasn't much word there but it wasn't eat it was the effect the word had on the people the word has never been less powerful but satan can infiltrate and water it down through all these white red what deception that's what satan does he deceives eve like we were talking about last night in the bible study you know he deceived he deceives that's what he does he does have some truth the tree of knowledge of good and evil satan come tell you some things that are true that's right he told eve everything that was true it said one word not he quoted the very thing god told eve he just put that word not because god said you shall surely die you watch in the bible say it says you shall not surely die same word that god spoke added one word to it one word caused the whole follow this whole thing we ought to know that the word not you shall not surely die and then she took that in and it became part over so that was where the fall happened that's where all the satan started injecting himself in the human race and then you see down through the ages after jesus came along jesus jesus was the seals so he was walking on the earth with the seals but then he had to allotted out to each church age he had a seven groups he had to talk to remember revelations two and three and to the church of and to the church of and to the church he was giving a part of himself out to that church age but it wasn't the fullness because satan was riding started riding in that first church age right along with the holy ghost in opposition so he was he was keeping the people it's like it's like mama said it's not that the word became less powerful satan just sugar coated it you know that and in in plant life just for an example you take a you take a plant and we do with our food plots we have to uh there's a ph balance in the soil fertilizer is good for plants and good to grow stuff right fertilizer everybody knows fertilizer is good to grow things but you know if you throw that fertilizer out and your alkaline your ph level is high actually that alkaline takes that takes that little ball of fertilizer you see didn't hit me it took that little ball of fertilizer that you see and it actually encapsulates it with alkaline fertilizer does no good none whatsoever you can put 2 000 pounds per acre of fertilizer and no lime to drop your ph and you've wasted see that's what it is about the word of god the word of god has been put out there and it's it's for our soul but if you let satan take in and just put that little put that little alkaline on it put that little acid that's what he does right he fills us with acid the prophet said he'll come in they'll fill you with acid put you in a congregation and fill you with acid and then you know what you've got a dysfunctional church so that's the same way you can see in what we do in a natural but if you throw the lime out there drop the ph of the soil once you put that fertilizer down it automatically starts breaking down into nutrients but if you don't same way with the word you can throw the word out but if you haven't got something to water if you if you ain't got that ph level down you know if you haven't got if you haven't got some spirit to go along with that word you're just casting your you know you can't you know that's why i said don't cast your pearls before it's that's why you don't do that you know but that's the same way with with the seals the seals have always been here brother they'll prove the seals were in genesis we preached it many times where the seals was right there in abel and kane showing exactly how that the the four horse riders were right there in in genesis chapter four right so the seals have been here since genesis it's just been what satan has made it of known effect you know what the scripture says you have made it the pharisees you've got the they had the very word handled the very word of god but they made it of non-effect by what their traditions their their traditions just went and encapsulated that word and would not let it out so that's the way it is with you and i but somewhere down the line everything's got to balance out we come up here to this eagle age and everything's going to balance out simply because there's no more ages to go there's no more people to come why haven't you been a problem that's why that eagle had to fly higher and be and be able to see all the way to genesis i see luther could have preached genesis but he could not have preached it and broke the seals down in the book of genesis sorry the revelation was there it's just satan had a hit right satan had it here in a white righteous church that everybody thought was good and everything was going great but no satan was sitting right there and he was eating same way with you and i that's why these seals have got to release us when you come down to here when you come down to finish up with a pale horse which is nothing but what we've talked mixed together that's the highest form right what we've taught about the first three white righteous church red killing the people and death killing the people killing people physically in the red the second seal then killing people spiritually in the third seal and then we've come up to here to where now is going to be a beast which is satan incarnate in a human being but we've also come to the to the place to where god can be manifest or incarnate in a human being that's what god always wanted he just couldn't do it down through the ages because they just they just had little bitty little bitty holes they could see through you remember the story brother around home about the boy looking through the knothole he just see a little bit of the circus but what happened when that other boy got on his shoulders and looked over the fence my saw the whole circus this little boy was just watching one in the light well that's what luther was doing he was looking through glass a little bitty glass wesley was looking through a little bitty glass pentecost was looking through a little bitty glass but when brother brown came the holy ghost came himself at pentecost but they stopped the holy ghost didn't they stopped the holy ghost kept riding into into brother branham just say that i don't don't mind saying that the holy ghost kept riding got off you know he rode on and he got on brother brown took the message of the water baptism and one god what happened in the garden of eden and all that they believed that some of them back in the in the early 80s but he took it on to something else something more he opened that um he whipped that top off of that pyramid remember and opened it up and looked down in there and he said there was writings that man had never seen well see luke had never seen it wesley's never seen him pentecost had never seen it in that fullness why he was an eagle he could fly up here look down at the things where man had to be a certain distance and if he saw a big old mountain he can't look over it so he his revelation stopped lying can just barely see over the grass as powerful as he is though he can't see over the grass ox is a little bit higher he can see a little bit he can see over the grass but he can't see as far as man can and man can artificially climb up things but an eagle can go way up higher than that go completely outside you know so here here we see a title that god showed us through animals how he's bringing the church back through the line the boldness of the line the the labor of the odds how we all labor with each other you know we've been around a long time we've still labored the man we gotta have intelligence for the word of god and then the eagle which is the one that sees everything and that's the anointing that we have now we're under the equal age anointing and for that to happen there had to become a prophet that's why brother brown had to come as that kind of prophet to see above everything and come back and show it to us he didn't just see it for himself and leave he saw it for himself and then brought it to the people that were still back on the earth per se in our revelation we were still earthbound he was heaven-bound but he was what he wasn't he didn't say well this is what it is and then he flew off no he called us eaglets he called us little messiahs little prophets little priests told us to come up that's what john said there and saw in revelations 4 come up higher come up hither in other words after the church ages so the church age ends on the seventh i mean on the fourth seal of the church agents because this is parallel with the church age the wicked one how much have we seen death and hell on the earth nobody's ever seen it this bad before nobody there was there was things in back you know in the ages that were you always had prostitutes but they were always under the table you may have already always had gay people but they were always under the table but look at it now that's right it's actually hell on earth i mean this is what hell's going to be in a perverted form not where we're at now it's going away it's going somewhere else because we're going we're going to reside on this earth but look at death and hell on earth and that's exactly what it is but if we don't take a body change the death is right here you ain't got to worry about looking at a naked woman or or somebody that's that's uh you know doing things wrong like sodom and gomorrah you better worry about this guy right here because we're all if we're all born again we're all going into rapture that's right that's a given right we're born again we're all going to go on a rapture that's why i got that those uh names back there i want those people to go on a rapture i want those people to be born again christians not just say i hope i'm going to go right not just say i hope i got a chance to go that's why you know dad told and i'll tell you tell them up front too if you're embarrassed because your kids are on there then you've got a problem yourself that's right i say you're not born again yourself why i want my kids saved whether god saves me or not i want my kids say and some of some other people that put their name on the list that i would say is born again but they want to make sure your wife gary atkins but they want to make sure make sure that they're born again whether you whether you understand the seals or understand this or understand that people were born again and didn't understand harley water baptism all right peter preached a sermon he said repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ and the bible said the holy ghost fell on the people i'm sure they went and got baptized but they went got baptized but they weren't baptized you know we think the water baptism sometimes i think we think that cure is a cure-all it's not you'll be baptized and go to hell in the name of jesus christ every day of your life that's right we baptize a lot that we baptize the name of jesus christ that we never see again so guess what their fruits prove who they were that did not change that's what i was telling a a girl it worked there i said if i baptize you the bible says you're supposed to change walk in newness of life you read listen to the scripture daddy reads when he baptizes somebody the scripture is you go down you lay everything out you're dead that's why that third seal was death you lay that thing out first you got to die first and when you come up you come up in newness of life you're not supposed to do the things you did before they put you under that water because that person's supposed to be dead completely empty not just baptize somebody and then you don't see them ever again you know me be a waste of time want to talk to somebody i baptize anybody wants to be baptized but i sure would like to sit down for about an hour and just really talk to him and then say do you really still want to do this because you're we're supposed to see more of you once we baptize you not less right isn't that the truth policy yeah it's not an insurance policy you're not guaranteed to go to heaven if you baptize the name of jesus christ it's not a guarantee that's right the bible says repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ repent means to what around going another direction right i was baptized when i was a little kid but you know when i come back to the lord that's the first thing i want to do is be baptized again you know why my conscience wasn't clear then i didn't come up a good boy when i was baptized at 12 years old when i was when i was baptized at 38 years old i came up in newness of life because everything around me changed i didn't have the same of course sure we were babies and we still made mistakes and all that but you got that's that's a good conscious but it actually supposed to push you towards something that's right same way with these seals i'm making a point i'm not really off my point that's what these seals are for they're pushing you to a point of a body change we've never had that before but these seals are pushing us toward if we don't have justification forget about seal two through seven forget about it get justified if you're not sanctified forget about seal three through seven i'm just that way i'm just i i just see some people that talk about the lord all the time and then they like brother claude said they live a hound no wife don't talk to me about the lord if you live a hound all life get your life straight i'll help you get your life straight then we'll talk about the lord but you talk about the lord and level and live a life contrary to what you're talking about i guess that's just something i just ain't been able to take it right you're supposed to have brotherly kindness and you're supposed to hang with people but maybe i'm right at that point to where i'm maybe i should i know dad's got a lot more grace than i do with uh with the people but but live the life first if that apple tree i can go outside today and i got five trees planted down in the yard and i know whatever one of them produced why because in the spring when they blossom they look the pear tree looks just like the apple tree but give it about another month it will start the apple tree will not have pears on it my three apple trees by their fruit i know that they're an apple tree because an apple starts growing on the end of that vine and then my other two pear trees i know they're pear trees because pears start growing on the other on the end of their vine why by the fruits you should be known and that's the same over the seals we got to get the life right first get justified get sanctified get full the holy ghost get into the word because that's the first four that gets you into glory but that's not the requirement of this age right that got people into glory from from the first church age to the seventh church age without knowing a thing about the seal without knowing a thing about a lot of things a lot of them went in being baptized in the name of father son holy ghost because that's all they knew but god winked at that and said hey this is a sincere heart i know because see he couldn't go over the book of joel joel saw the vision of that tree being eaten down right read restoration of the bribery sometimes really good book to read and then he saw the restoration of that tree so so jesus couldn't come and preach anything different than what he saw in joel because he's when he wrote what was in john through joel he was one that wrote it so he couldn't say anything different he said you must be born again actually it's born again b-o-r-n is not born you're born again because what you bear something that means it's born from you he said you must be born from above millions of people were born the other way billions of people have been born the other way you understand about this other day a couple days ago seven billion people in this world and there was probably 100 of us here i couldn't figure the percentage what percentage of that is of what's out there in this world doing the things of the world even being just living good lives and then coming closer and living a good um what we call a nominal christian life and then coming down to us how little of a group compared to the billions of people in this world that will never hear the word jesus christ never hear the of the revelation that we have kind of makes you humble doesn't it if you got a little part of it hold on to it that's right hold on to it you got just a little spark hold on to that spark but see if you don't get the spark first there can't be a fire that's right you can't build a fire without spark you got to have a spark first i don't care if you got this great big blower this big there's something there goes what and when it does what happens one little spark shoots out and if you got 25 000 btus behind it all of a sudden you got that flowing out of that chamber just from one little spark so get the spark that's why i said about those kids back there i don't want them just in church i don't want to fill a few we'll have to build a new church well then 80 people come back but i want i want us to be functional christians right i'm gonna be speaking on that some functional christians not just christians functional christians god speaks of us as being his body right sometimes i believe some of his bodies a little on the dead side paralyzed maybe not dead but paralyzed you know it would be good to get maybe just a hallelujah every once in a while you know praise the lord move a little we don't have to be fanatical but you know what god's body is a moving body remember brother brown said when man stood still god kept moving right because man would would be in the work of god in the in the in the baptist and the presbyterian and all that god had to work in all those but what happened when they stopped he just moved on off and kept on going because god's a moving god we'll read it in ezekiel those four combat beasts never stop they're always moving always moving always going all those those angels in heaven they're not sitting on on their seats going no they're praising god and just moving all over the place and then we got them all down here with us to help us so you got movement god's in move god you know god's in movement he's not in he's not in dead letter this is a living word this word is alive why all this was about people and why do we come up to the end time and think we're anything different we are a special group of people but we're not different in that we got to do something extraordinary no let's just start doing what the bible says first get the holy ghost get the baptism of the holy ghost then you birth start becoming a functional christian somebody read your bible and pray do things right in life don't say oops so much we gotta quit you know i was telling i told him at brother doug scott's and i i believe in a hundred percent you know the quota brother realm says we're living below our privileges that's been 45 years ago he made that quote we're still quoting it quotes will kill you we have no excuse bro bob why do we keep saying we will we living below a privilege no one day we gotta come up to that privilege and start living that privilege you hear preachers i do too and i say it sometimes myself we are living below our privileges but one day we gotta meet that privilege somewhere if we keep living below our privileges we're going to let this thing right here take a hold of us and it's not spiritual death if you're born again but it's natural death looking at every one of us i got older rebecca's got older older joyce got older who else had a birthday in january mr kathy much older and you know every birthday coming up we get one year older so thank god thank the lord and that's the good option you know somebody said something to me the other day about that i said well the other option let's talk to a believer somebody over in dutch's church i guess it was talking about birthdays and they and i said well you know the other options not that good you know before being you know being dead and they look to me and said well no that'd be good for us to get out of here and i thought for a second and i said no you're looking at it wrong the bible says there's going to be a group here that says we which are alive and remain i'm not going to confess that i'm just going to take that other option i still have birthdays for god changes me that's right abraham just continued having birthdays till he got changed he wasn't looking at death when it come to that you know i'm sure he died naturally but we're not going to do that that's not promise to us so the other option is not the greatest option if you think you're going to be here for the change because if you're dead you ain't gonna be here for the live and remain i'll promise you that but on this four seal let's put everything everything's gotta come together everything that we talked about everything that we have looked into white because if you take white red and black put it in a paint can and swirl it around you're going to get do it sometime just take food coloring and swirl it around you're going to get the palest awfulest dullest kind of a gray like you see these zombies that they have on tv and all that stuff you see this dead look well that's what it is if you still got all three of them working in your life you're gonna be a pretty pale horse you know i like puzzles i don't get to do them but i do like puzzles when i collect them and there's one that i noticed in a book i'm debating about it's the apocalypse and the way they drew it is a pure white horse and they're really running like a gallop a pure white horse and then a red horse and a true black and then this gray it looks like a an appaloosa is that what they're called yeah it's a gray horse like an apple gray it's pretty but when you know what it means yeah yeah well hey all this is pretty to the world he's got them food they're in the beauty of the world but that pale horse means death to us we know that's what i mean you know even looking at the picture because brother brown said hey john looked at that church and had my and admired her as a beautiful church but she was dead hiding behind all that so read some more on the fourth seal read your book read the fourth seal that brother brown talks about we'll make a few comments next sunday lord bless you thank you
