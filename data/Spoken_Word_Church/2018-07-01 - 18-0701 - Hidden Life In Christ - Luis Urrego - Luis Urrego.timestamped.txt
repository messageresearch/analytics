[0:08] okay thank you
[0:12] I trust that everybody's had a good week
[0:15] and and I trusted you all have been
[0:19] enjoying what brother wait they're
[0:21] bringing out of our romance yeah I think
[0:24] it's very good and you know yeah you
[0:26] might say well we're doing a lot of
[0:27] reading well that's what we're here for
[0:30] right well it's the word that takes
[0:32] preeminence right but but I like I've
[0:37] always liked that going verse by verse
[0:39] and taking even brother Brennan did that
[0:41] he did that all the time that was the
[0:44] way he talked which is going verse by
[0:46] verse and just staying on the verse even
[0:49] to services but then you keep going keep
[0:51] going
[0:52] well if you say even kept brother I mean
[0:54] you kept up yeah brother job when that
[0:57] actually for for a while you know until
[1:01] somebody got tired anyways well we're
[1:06] gonna go ahead and uh I've just been
[1:08] thinking about this little thought here
[1:12] I've been thinking about the thought of
[1:14] a hidden life in Christ or the hidden
[1:18] life of Christ in the believer and and
[1:23] the reason why I was thinking about this
[1:24] was something that something that I
[1:27] heard a couple of months ago brother
[1:28] wait on him brother Dale brought out and
[1:32] he was talking about and he's talking
[1:34] about how in the ages the cankerworm the
[1:38] caterpillar the locust all the different
[1:41] worms the bugs had eaten down the world
[1:45] right throughout the ages and but what
[1:50] they could not eat down was was the root
[1:55] correct and I thought and that really
[1:58] stood out to me because I never ever saw
[2:01] it that way before and I believe in
[2:03] brother Branham teaches taught the same
[2:05] thing because what the devil and the
[2:10] religious systems the outside systems
[2:13] the outside forces can do they can kill
[2:16] the influence of the word in your life
[2:19] right they can kill just like just like
[2:25] Satan and religious systems of Jesus of
[2:30] when Jesus was here on earth of that day
[2:32] they were able to kill the flesh body of
[2:38] Jesus Christ right but they could not
[2:40] kill that life right that life was
[2:43] hidden I mean none of that that they
[2:45] couldn't even understand that life right
[2:47] right so therefore with the religious
[2:49] systems of that of our day and different
[2:53] nominal ideas throughout different ages
[2:56] were killing the influence of the word
[2:58] in the room in the bullet and the
[3:00] believers life because of the way they
[3:03] were hiding the word more and more from
[3:05] the people we know that the Catholic
[3:07] Church they they did that you know the
[3:09] only ones that could have a Bible even
[3:10] open it to read it were just the priests
[3:13] and they would read it to them in Latin
[3:14] and so and people wouldn't even really
[3:17] understand so that influence was being
[3:19] killed but still did not mean that new
[3:22] births were not taking place there was
[3:25] still new births taking place for the
[3:27] word that they have for their death
[3:28] right there were birthing and the word
[3:31] that they had for their day so the life
[3:34] of the word was not killed that's the
[3:36] reason why Jesus Christ I mean he
[3:39] resurrected because that life that life
[3:41] was there right and that's why he said I
[3:43] will restore the set the Lord so that
[3:47] life was coming back up because they
[3:48] could not take out the root that's where
[3:50] that's where
[3:51] like this because that root is ain't and
[3:53] you know you look down at her tree and
[3:54] the roots especially when they're
[3:56] extended I mean there's no way
[3:58] especially if it's hooked in and to us
[4:01] or river source right and and I believe
[4:04] was David that talked about with a
[4:05] pleated tree this planted by the waters
[4:08] you know it's always got the source of
[4:10] life right there
[4:11] and so so that got me to thinking you
[4:15] know and I I preached a message a couple
[4:17] of months ago about when God saw the
[4:20] light we when we looked at Genesis
[4:23] chapter one and we want to look let's
[4:25] just look that real quick minute in
[4:28] Genesis chapter one
[4:47] that's so different here
[5:01] that's this one
[5:09] about once a month early Genesis from
[5:12] the birth birth death anniversary in the
[5:16] beginning God created the heaven the
[5:18] earth and the earth was without form and
[5:20] void and darkness was upon the face of
[5:22] the deep and the Spirit of God moved
[5:24] upon the face of the water haploid
[5:27] moment ago just keep and God said let
[5:31] there be light and there was light right
[5:33] there so God said let there be light and
[5:38] there was life right when we look up
[5:41] that word light amen
[5:43] I like this meaning right there it says
[5:49] the light of life right so that was
[5:53] God's life amen
[5:55] that light that it was talking about we
[5:56] know it's not the Sun you know it's not
[5:58] the moon because later down in several
[6:00] verses later we see where God created
[6:02] the moon the stars in the Sun right so
[6:07] that is the life that I wanted to
[6:09] discuss this morning amen
[6:12] and and I guess if I could give this a
[6:15] little title the hidden life of Christ
[6:18] in the believer and so let's look at
[6:26] these these scriptures here I don't have
[6:28] anything here organized so you all
[6:30] forgive me he's been looking through
[6:32] some things kind of preparing a full
[6:35] message so I don't have a slot
[6:38] PowerPoint presentation or anything so
[6:41] just bear with me but let's read here
[6:44] enough the Colossians chapter 3 it says
[6:47] if you then be risen with Christ seek
[6:49] those things which are above where
[6:58] where Christ sitteth on the right hand
[7:01] of God set your affections on things
[7:04] above not on things on the earth for ye
[7:08] are dead and your life is hid with
[7:13] Christ in God amended us when when
[7:22] Christ who is our life shall appear when
[7:27] Christ who is our life shall appear then
[7:30] shall ye observe up here now I like what
[7:33] it says there when Christ who is our
[7:35] life right shall appear then shall ye
[7:40] also appear with him in glory amen
[7:44] so we not we for the believer we is not
[7:48] that we just have amen when we have
[7:52] Christ we have the true life of God
[7:54] right here and the same thing when we
[7:56] just saw in Genesis chapter 1 that life
[7:59] amen
[8:00] was the life of God it's what it's what
[8:04] makes up the believer when it when when
[8:06] when you're born into the kingdom of God
[8:09] amen you have the life of Christ amen
[8:13] and it's no longer you live in but is
[8:14] Christ living through you amen and you
[8:16] right is right all right so so let's
[8:23] read this let's read here in Ephesians
[8:25] chapter 3
[8:29] says for this cause i paul the prisoner
[8:32] jesus christ for you gentiles if you
[8:37] have heard of the dispensation of the
[8:40] grace of god which has given me to you
[8:44] word how that by revelation he made
[8:47] known unto me the mystery as i wrote
[8:50] afore in few words whereby when you read
[8:52] you may understand my knowledge in the
[8:55] mystery of christ right which in other
[9:00] ages was not made known unto the sons of
[9:03] men as it is now revealed unto his holy
[9:08] apostles and prophets by the spirit amen
[9:13] that the gentiles should be fellow heirs
[9:17] and of the same body and partakers of
[9:21] his promise in Christ by the gospel so
[9:27] either with this life was a mystery
[9:30] throughout ages right we're off I was
[9:34] made a minister according to the gift of
[9:36] of the grace of God given unto me by the
[9:41] effectual working of his power unto me
[9:43] who am less than the least of All Saints
[9:46] is this grace given that I should preach
[9:48] among the Gentiles the unsearchable
[9:51] riches of Christ and to make all men and
[9:58] to make all men see what is the
[10:04] Fellowship of the mystery which from the
[10:06] beginning art and to make our men to see
[10:09] what is the Fellowship of the mystery
[10:10] which from the beginning of the world
[10:12] have been hid in God who created all
[10:21] things by Jesus Jesus Christ
[10:24] so this mystery has been hidden God from
[10:27] the beginning and now it's been revealed
[10:32] unto us right so since you and I are
[10:37] privileged people in this our right to
[10:42] have this mystery have been revealed
[10:44] not just to you and me but through you
[10:47] in me because it's hid it's attached to
[10:52] the life of Christ right to the intent
[10:57] I see where we are to the intent
[11:01] brothers personally to make all men see
[11:04] what is fellowship of the mystery which
[11:06] from the beginning of the world hath
[11:08] been hid in God who created all things
[11:11] by Jesus Christ to the intent that now
[11:13] unto the principalities and powers and
[11:15] heavenly places might be known by the
[11:17] church the manifold wisdom of God
[11:20] according to the eternal purpose which
[11:22] he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord in
[11:25] whom we have boldness and access with
[11:29] confidence by the faith of him yes we
[11:35] didn't have boldness and confidence
[11:36] before we were scared when I was young
[11:40] and I would hear about if I did
[11:42] something wrong I thought Christ or God
[11:44] was going to send down the lightning
[11:46] bolt any moment and but now we don't
[11:49] seek God that way right right
[11:52] at least you shouldn't you shouldn't if
[11:56] you still see God that way you know then
[11:58] you need to you need to grow in God you
[12:02] know you need to get closer you know
[12:04] have a personal relationship than God
[12:06] because it wants you just like as Paul
[12:09] says here in verse 12 in whom we have
[12:11] boldness and access with confidence by
[12:17] the faith of him and in Hebrews in
[12:20] Hebrews it talks about us entering in to
[12:23] the into into the UH into his sanctuary
[12:27] with boldness and
[12:29] confidence right because that's how we
[12:32] need to approach God God you said it in
[12:35] your word I believe it that settles it
[12:36] that's right that's why he wants you and
[12:39] me to do but sometimes the way we
[12:43] approach God is be approaching
[12:47] God if he want to run but that's not the
[12:52] way we approach God reproach him with
[12:55] bonus taking his word what God loves for
[12:58] us to take his word back to him because
[13:01] that's the only good thing he reads
[13:02] that's the only thing he will he will
[13:05] back up as his own word not your
[13:08] thoughts not your own not your own
[13:10] thinking but his own word and so if you
[13:13] if that word has given you confidence
[13:15] and boldness and you approach God with
[13:17] that boldness that you've received
[13:18] through the word to tell him he has to
[13:21] do nothing but but answer whatever
[13:24] whatever you have me of amen so in whom
[13:29] we have boldness and access with
[13:31] confidence through faith of me and
[13:33] wherefore I desire that you ain't not at
[13:35] my tribulations for witches your glory
[13:38] amen
[13:38] praise God now so um I was thinking
[13:45] about the UH and I will read another
[13:48] scripture here in just a moment but and
[13:51] see if I could bring
[13:52] this quote that brother Brennan you know
[13:56] what since I actually read a whole
[13:58] message last night started at the
[14:02] beginning and ended at the same the same
[14:04] night and I usually I usually don't do
[14:07] that it takes me several days but last
[14:10] night I was just looking at this hidden
[14:11] life in Christ medicine like wow this
[14:13] thing's really good but brother Brennan
[14:16] says here it says my burdens are like
[14:18] yoke up with him the yoke is all padded
[14:21] with hallelujahs when you're once inside
[14:24] the veil with him he becomes your life
[14:28] the prophet said that in the people of
[14:30] the old day said he would write his laws
[14:32] of new he would put them in their heart
[14:37] now Mount Sinai was a place of duty but
[14:41] Mount Calvary was a place of grace
[14:44] people are still trying to live on Mount
[14:47] Sinai you know with the do's and dont's
[14:49] the law thank you but they don't they
[14:53] don't see about the grace of Christ that
[14:56] has come down we're living in a
[14:57] dispensation of grace right where that
[15:02] and that's why brother Brown was talking
[15:03] about Mount Calvary right people are
[15:07] still trying to live on Mount Sinai if
[15:09] I'll go to church if I'll pay my dues if
[15:11] I'll do this or death I'll quit this and
[15:13] stop that that's still on Mount Sinai
[15:17] when you come to a place where you are
[15:19] dead and your life is hid in God through
[15:23] Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost the
[15:26] whole Christian life becomes a great
[15:28] glorious shout and hallelujah to you and
[15:31] your head away daily that's key not
[15:37] every now and then but you're hid away
[15:39] daily on a daily basis now we notice
[15:43] that once in there he was isolated from
[15:46] though once the believer was in there
[15:48] the person was in there the priest and
[15:51] that
[15:51] time he was isolated from the world
[15:53] their curtains the curtains dropped
[15:56] around him and he was hit away with God
[15:59] everything become real even though he
[16:03] knew that he had to do these things he
[16:06] knew the law he knew though the the but
[16:10] it wasn't really a real thing until he
[16:12] was behind the behind that veil or the
[16:17] holy of holes alright now I'll get to
[16:21] that just more glory a glory in this
[16:23] place where we once get hit away with
[16:25] Christ everything becomes a new thing to
[16:27] us then that's the reason why I don't
[16:31] see why people get bored with the word
[16:35] you know I can understand nominal people
[16:39] they don't know what to preach and they
[16:41] don't know what what else to look at so
[16:43] they'll just kind of rehash it's kind of
[16:44] like the world you know they don't know
[16:46] what other movie to come out with so
[16:48] they'll just rehash something that came
[16:49] out in the 70s and just add new effects
[16:51] to it computer effects and and and and
[16:55] unfortunately to some people I say even
[16:59] even people who know that God sent a
[17:02] prophet in this day they've gotten to a
[17:05] stagnant place in their life where the
[17:07] word doesn't even do anything
[17:09] fortunately it's not a new thing to us
[17:13] anymore and the reason why is because
[17:16] we're don't go in behind the
[17:19] see it's okay that we are out in the
[17:23] outer court right and and I have a
[17:26] picture here the tabernacle right it's
[17:30] all right that we have we have the out
[17:32] of court and you know what when the
[17:34] manna would fall the manna fell on the
[17:37] outer court manna fell outside of the
[17:40] tabernacle right
[17:41] because the people were living outside
[17:43] of the tabernacle was right so the word
[17:45] I mean I know that manna would represent
[17:47] the word but they would get nourished
[17:52] and they would get that manna every
[17:54] single morning afresh and remember that
[17:57] God told him not to take not to eat that
[18:00] manna that same thing don't let it go
[18:02] throughout the don't let it get old
[18:04] don't let it go throughout the day
[18:06] because by nighttime evening time it was
[18:08] old it was already getting worms and
[18:10] everything like that that's the reason
[18:12] why the but the the the the manna that
[18:15] we eat the Word of God is not to be
[18:18] stored head knowledge right it's to be
[18:21] eaten right that's what God wants us to
[18:24] do is eat the word not to just to have
[18:27] it as head knowledge because as head
[18:29] knowledge it's not gonna do you any good
[18:31] after a while it's gonna get gonna get
[18:34] old it's gonna get stinky it's gonna get
[18:36] it's gonna get wiggle wiggle tails it's
[18:39] not going to produce the life of Christ
[18:41] right but when the when the Israelites
[18:45] doing that manner would fall fresh they
[18:47] go out and gather it every morning
[18:49] meaning that every day every morning you
[18:53] should be seeking God every day it's all
[18:57] it should be it should be you and God
[18:59] afresh every single day right yes and
[19:03] every morning they would come out and
[19:05] get that manna and they would have to
[19:07] eat it right away
[19:08] in order for to strengthen them for the
[19:11] day right
[19:12] same thing with us amen every time you
[19:16] get that word and you receive it and you
[19:18] need it amen it's for the strength of
[19:20] the strength that God has for youth for
[19:23] the time that you are sitting at right
[19:25] that's right don't give me that
[19:27] I believe God gives us food in due
[19:30] season because that's what the Bible
[19:32] says for the round table table that he
[19:34] gives us food in due season he gives us
[19:36] food exactly the exact food that we need
[19:39] for the time that we need it for
[19:42] you know my wife she talks about
[19:52] [Music]
[20:03] now my wife she would she's mentioned to
[20:06] me before that during the time that we
[20:11] started out I'm in the hut I've known
[20:12] you all you know it's like early
[20:15] two-thousands but then we didn't really
[20:17] start coming here to church go round
[20:19] towards the end latter part of 2014 and
[20:23] of course God knew that we needed this
[20:25] type of preaching we needed this type of
[20:26] work right and it was a couple of months
[20:34] down the road after we started visiting
[20:36] here that we started seeing that my
[20:38] mother-in-law she was getting sick right
[20:41] she was she was getting sick and things
[20:44] were getting bad with her you know and
[20:47] eventually you know she went off to be
[20:48] with the Lord but during this time
[20:51] Christine my wife she tells me that
[20:53] brother Dale and the minister here would
[20:57] bring out preachings about about what it
[21:02] is about to be on the other side you
[21:05] know the going pass beyond the curtain
[21:08] of time and and all those things to
[21:11] bring an extra an understanding a
[21:13] further understanding than what she had
[21:15] at that time which helped her when it
[21:18] came time because God knew that her mom
[21:21] was going to go away and so it gave her
[21:24] more confident more more comfort when
[21:27] mom when my mother-in-law passed away
[21:29] that she knew that everything was ok you
[21:32] know everything
[21:34] you know she had I mean we know we all
[21:36] know we've read the the the testimony
[21:39] that brother Baron talked about going
[21:41] beyond the curtain of time but sometimes
[21:43] it's just here no but then when you
[21:45] actually look at things and in a more
[21:48] deeper way and looking at in the Bible
[21:50] studies and things like that looking at
[21:52] those things it really solidifies your
[21:55] thinking about those things and really
[21:56] builds confidence in right that's the
[22:00] reason why when you have confidence in
[22:02] the word and when you have confidence in
[22:04] your in your where you know where you're
[22:05] standing in Jesus Christ that's why you
[22:08] can approach him with boldness and
[22:09] confidence right because that word has
[22:12] given you it's been revealed to you
[22:13] right and when something is revealed to
[22:16] you and that no devil in Hell can take
[22:19] that away from all right no no the Satan
[22:23] can take that away from it because it
[22:25] sits there and it won't move it won't
[22:27] shake yes it's true
[22:36] to preach in this captured
[22:40] right
[22:42] [Music]
[22:46] that's the one that's gonna make make me
[22:50] go who has made Christ their head he's
[22:55] the perfect man
[22:55] right and when that perfect man that
[22:59] life of that perfect man is in you
[23:03] because it's not it's not since it's not
[23:06] that we all have these virtues already
[23:10] in us the only thing that's going to
[23:14] they have to manifest on the outside
[23:16] right but the only way they can manifest
[23:19] on the outside is if you keep feeding on
[23:21] that body when that life all right
[23:25] they just won't manifest on the outside
[23:27] just on their own right you have to keep
[23:30] eat so I always look at the statue of a
[23:33] perfect man and I was going to get into
[23:34] that appreciated because you know just
[23:39] as a new Tabernacle you know you were
[23:41] walking towards the Holies of Holies
[23:44] that's the head right there right that's
[23:48] that's the glory of God right there
[23:49] you're also walking into that that's the
[23:52] head right there right Christ is our Hey
[23:56] that's that's that's all in all right
[24:00] there and and so going back to the to
[24:06] the manna so in that mana
[24:09] it was told by molded to Moses to take
[24:12] some of that men on that original manner
[24:14] and to put it in in that holy of holies
[24:19] right now if that man on the outside it
[24:22] would get old it would get stinky would
[24:26] get worms but the manna which represents
[24:29] the word it was placed in a golden top
[24:32] the Bible says we know that Christ is
[24:36] always typed with gold you know
[24:40] so it was placed in a golden vessel and
[24:43] every time the priest would go back in
[24:46] there he could take some of that manner
[24:48] and it would always taste the same and
[24:53] actually it would always be needed right
[24:58] here on the outside it would give wiggle
[25:01] tails that would get old alright so and
[25:06] so a lot of people a lot of people you
[25:09] know the way I see it nominal people
[25:13] even people who have even gotten to know
[25:17] this message know that God sent a
[25:19] prophet there's still sometimes stuff
[25:22] that justification and sanctification
[25:23] right and then some have come further a
[25:29] bit more right gotten into the word more
[25:33] and of course we know that they're that
[25:36] good that they're here they're they're
[25:38] all about the mysteries and all about
[25:41] their giving in the word a bit more amen
[25:45] but there's something a men that that
[25:48] they haven't gotten to where that life
[25:51] of Christ because this here can just be
[25:54] all head knowledge you see you can see
[25:58] the lampstand you can know what the
[26:00] lampstands about you can know what the
[26:03] church ages is about right the sinner
[26:08] out here could probably know what the
[26:09] church take is about right they can even
[26:13] know about baptism the navel or Jesus
[26:16] Christ by head knowledge but the thing
[26:19] the thing is is that if you go and do it
[26:22] that's when you know that you're there's
[26:25] been
[26:25] to you right away they can know about
[26:29] the table of showbread they see they
[26:30] pray the golden incense altar is a type
[26:34] of the prayers they pray but they just
[26:38] can't seem to get in
[26:40] that Chicano glory of God why because
[26:44] they haven't come in there's something
[26:47] that that that's hindering them from
[26:50] further get further further in
[26:52] themselves in the word I'm happy where I
[26:54] am I'm happy out here I'm happy with God
[26:58] sent a prophet I'm happy with
[27:00] justification sanctification amen
[27:04] the God has only got to reveal himself
[27:06] to you the further that you go with
[27:09] Frank he never pulls us by the hand and
[27:13] said you're coming here no he's he's a
[27:16] gentleman that's what I like about God
[27:20] right
[27:25] so that that goat that mana so the
[27:27] priest could always partake of that mana
[27:30] every time you do a another thing is
[27:32] Aaron's rod was in there you know that
[27:36] humanity or would and the Bible types
[27:39] humanity right that rod under Aaron's
[27:45] hand it did all that get it was dry it
[27:49] was but when once it was placed in the
[27:53] Shekinah glory of God in that work in
[27:56] that in that and the Holy of Holies
[27:58] it started liven it up again it even
[28:02] buddy because do you say well that rod
[28:08] or that stick wasn't attached to no tree
[28:11] but yet it was it was a text to a life a
[28:17] life that which is the root right
[28:19] remember we talked about the Genesis one
[28:22] amen that life that light right so it
[28:25] was attached to the life the source even
[28:28] though there was a no physical tree that
[28:30] it was a test and it was growing almonds
[28:32] and things you see
[28:34] so everything out here is everything
[28:38] that you can do to approach God right so
[28:42] what you have to do to approach God in
[28:44] that in itself that's religion religion
[28:48] is what man duster to try to get close
[28:50] to God
[28:52] Christianity or the life of the believer
[28:55] is what God does to try to grow closer
[28:57] to man right but then when you come in
[29:01] here behind this veil is everything is
[29:03] about God then nothing that you can do
[29:06] why because you didn't make that rod bud
[29:10] you didn't make that you didn't make
[29:12] that that mana stay fresh in a new no
[29:17] it's it stays like that and all you have
[29:19] to do is pour take over its partake of
[29:23] it and admire and
[29:25] and in and we know that also between the
[29:30] gold the chair of the growth of the
[29:33] cherubs that were there of the the
[29:35] tabernacle or the ark we know that there
[29:41] was even a glow light that would come
[29:43] down right so it was all about
[29:46] represented life and light and so when
[29:50] you go in behind there everything is a
[29:54] neat to me then so whenever week with
[29:57] whenever you're whenever you're when you
[30:01] when the were the believer receives the
[30:03] new birth in his life and in their soul
[30:07] that's as if you're in there right
[30:11] this is the view in there that's the
[30:14] that's the eternal nest that's that's
[30:16] God Himself right there in the belief
[30:20] and of course we know that that the
[30:23] priest couldn't stay there forever
[30:25] they have to eventually come back out
[30:28] the process that you keep repeating
[30:30] right process that you keep going in and
[30:33] out
[30:33] well eventually remember I was talking
[30:36] about the the other day eventually one
[30:38] day will always be in there
[30:42] amen and you know coming out right
[30:48] perfection that is finest right face
[30:52] done so
[30:58] you mean I wanted to read this real
[30:59] quick and then we'll turn down Colossus
[31:03] scepter teeth
[31:08] all right
[31:12] and start at verse five here says for
[31:14] for though I be absent and the flesh yet
[31:17] I am with you in the spirit of joining
[31:18] and beholding your order and the
[31:22] steadfastness of your faith in Christ as
[31:26] you have therefore received Christ Jesus
[31:28] the Lord so mean so walk ye in him
[31:32] rooted and built up in him and
[31:35] established in the faith as he have been
[31:38] taught abounding therein with
[31:41] Thanksgiving talked about the
[31:50] uncircumcision and the circumcision of
[31:53] the Spirit and all that and the other
[31:59] night I was I was reading with this with
[32:01] the girls I was reading with the girls
[32:05] in here in proverbs chapter 27 we came
[32:09] up this this verse right here it says
[32:12] verse 7 right here it says the full soul
[32:17] loketh and honeycomb that means a person
[32:21] that's full doesn't want to eat anymore
[32:22] right you know and I looked at the
[32:26] history on that as as travelers were
[32:28] traveling they would be maybe eating
[32:31] some things on their way and they've
[32:35] come to like a honeycomb on there under
[32:38] on their travels they wouldn't want any
[32:40] of that because they were already full
[32:42] right just like if you keep snacking all
[32:45] day long no
[32:46] dinner at night you know but to the
[32:50] hungry soul every better thing is sweet
[32:55] but to the hungry soul every bitter
[32:58] thing every bitter thing is sweet now
[33:02] you remember the the you remember that
[33:04] in the Old Testament when this children
[33:06] of Israel were caring to cry leave Egypt
[33:08] they have to eat the lamb bitter herbs
[33:11] were added into it it's the same thing
[33:15] when we when we're walking in this way
[33:19] bitter herbs are gonna bitter things are
[33:23] gonna happen amen in our lives right but
[33:26] to the hungry soul that should be the
[33:28] believer amen
[33:29] right every bitter thing is sweet no
[33:35] matter what's going on in your life no
[33:38] matter what's happening no matter the
[33:39] chaos everything it can be falling all
[33:41] around you but when I'm in Christ when
[33:44] I'm hidden behind that veil everything
[33:45] is sweet no matter that priest was in
[33:48] there behind the inner veil it doesn't
[33:50] matter what was happening on the outside
[33:51] there were slain Lambs and killing blood
[33:54] and things going or splattering
[33:56] everywhere that the world was taking
[33:58] place all kinds of things was taking
[34:00] place but while you will that well while
[34:03] you're in there in that interval none of
[34:06] that was affecting because you were in
[34:10] the presence of God right and the reason
[34:13] why I say that is because the world is
[34:15] going into course right there's lots of
[34:18] killing there's lots of chaos there's
[34:21] lots of things taking place in our day
[34:25] but when your life is hitting Christ
[34:26] when you have that life of Christ and
[34:28] you're in that glory none of that none
[34:32] of that is poverty so to the hungry soul
[34:35] every bitter thing is sweet that's why
[34:38] when and we'll finish with this that's
[34:39] the reason why in Revelation Jesus the
[34:43] angel told the angel told John Lee was
[34:47] the angel told John said eat the book
[34:50] right when when when you eat it it's
[34:55] gonna be sweet and then but then it'll
[34:58] be better to put it to your belly right
[35:00] that's the life of a Christian you got
[35:03] sweet moments and you have bitter
[35:05] moments but you know how to balance it
[35:07] you know how to balance it when you're
[35:09] in Christ
[35:10] hey so I guess we can go up now so thank
[35:14] you for listening
[35:15] [Music]
