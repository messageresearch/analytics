[0:00] will guide us, Lord, like you your
[0:02] promise said that your spirit would
[0:04] guide us, guide us into all truth. I
[0:06] pray, God, that you'll give us give feed
[0:09] our expecting hearts. We pray in your
[0:10] name.
[0:12] Amen. Um so, uh we we're just going to
[0:17] take this a little thought from 1
[0:19] Corinthians 7, trouble in the flesh. And
[0:21] I I do have slides today, so we'll we
[0:23] got some things to look at.
[0:25] Um 1 Corinthians 7:33 says, "He that is
[0:28] married carried carth for the things
[0:31] that are of the world, how he may please
[0:33] his wife." And you know, Paul's kind of
[0:36] talking about how that um like in Paul's
[0:39] situation, he had uh you know, they
[0:43] lowered him over a basket over the wall
[0:45] and uh put him in all kinds of
[0:47] situations that would have been way more
[0:49] difficult than if he were u married. So
[0:52] what he's trying to caution is is if you
[0:54] get married, uh you you know in Paul's
[0:58] situation, you know, he's he would not
[1:00] he would not be able to maybe do the
[1:02] things that he would um or uh be devoted
[1:05] in the way that he he could if if in his
[1:08] in his singleness, I guess. So what what
[1:10] Paul's trying to say is in in 1
[1:12] Corinthians 7 is if you desire to be
[1:15] single, there's nothing wrong with that.
[1:18] If you desire to be married, there's
[1:20] nothing wrong with that. Just make sure
[1:21] that you're putting all of your priority
[1:23] to God. Make sure that you're giving
[1:26] everything to Christ. And and he's we'll
[1:30] see in a moment when we get into this
[1:31] scripture that he's he's he's framing it
[1:33] up that, you know, when you get married,
[1:36] I I I'm I'm trying to give you a little
[1:37] bit of warning that there's, you know,
[1:39] trouble in the flesh. You there's things
[1:41] that um uh you know, that Well, we'll
[1:45] get into in a second. Here we go. And so
[1:48] one of the things that Paul uh the early
[1:50] church kind of battled was this thought
[1:52] of um that if I if I punish myself in
[1:56] the flesh and that's going to make me
[1:58] holier and and that's called
[2:00] aeticism. Aseticism it's it's like a
[2:03] stronger form of of legalism where you
[2:05] think if I if I punish myself then that
[2:07] makes me makes me better somehow. Paul
[2:09] kind of addressed that in 1 Timothy
[2:11] chapter 4 where he said speaking lies
[2:12] and hypocrisy having their conscience
[2:14] seared with a hot iron, forbidding to
[2:16] marry. Uh if if you if you get married
[2:19] or if you have and you can see how this
[2:22] moves on into the Roman Catholic idea
[2:24] that a priest should not get married,
[2:26] those kind of things. If you don't get
[2:28] married, you're holier, you're somehow
[2:30] better, you're more righteous.
[2:32] forbidding to marry and commanding to
[2:34] abstain from meats which God hath
[2:36] created to be received with thanksgiving
[2:38] of them which believe and know the
[2:40] truth. So in other words, I I got to
[2:42] deny myself physically to grow
[2:44] spiritually or become holy. Now you you
[2:47] can see how that kind of creeps into our
[2:49] own ideas sometimes. We we think that if
[2:51] we can afflict punishment on ourselves
[2:53] or something that maybe somehow will
[2:55] make us make us more righteous. But to
[2:57] grow cro closer to God, it takes the
[2:59] word, the word to claim our to claim our
[3:02] lives. And it it it takes unity with
[3:04] Christ. Without without unity with
[3:06] Christ, you can beat yourself all day
[3:08] long and and you're not going to get
[3:09] closer to God. Uh like Martin Luther
[3:13] said, "I tortured myself with prayers,
[3:15] fasting, vigils, and freezing. The frost
[3:18] alone might have killed me." And and
[3:20] then Martin Luther he actually needed
[3:22] something from God. that it wasn't
[3:24] enough just to uh Y'all laughing at my
[3:30] animations. Listen, I I found how neat
[3:32] AI is and it's just I I had to spice
[3:36] these up a little bit. So, give wake you
[3:40] up a little bit maybe.
[3:42] So, you know, skipping meals to impress
[3:44] God, living in isolation like like a
[3:47] hermit or or beating your body to
[3:49] control sin or or avoiding marriage
[3:52] because it feels more spiritual. So,
[3:54] that's one of the things Paul's trying
[3:56] to address here that you in the people
[3:59] in that day maybe they thought that if
[4:00] you avoided marriage or avoided the
[4:03] things that go into
[4:04] marriage to kind of talk around that
[4:08] that somehow you're more you're more
[4:10] spiritual. No, it that that doesn't make
[4:12] you make you any closer to God. Now, to
[4:15] get closer to God, Paul would frame it
[4:16] up in Galatians 5 chapter 5. Walk in the
[4:18] spirit and you shall not fulfill the
[4:20] lust of the flesh. It's the spirit that
[4:23] quickens the word. In Colossians 2:20,
[4:25] he said, "Wherefore, if you be dead with
[4:27] Christ from the rudiments of the world,
[4:28] why as though living in the world are
[4:31] you subject to
[4:32] ordinances? Touch not, taste not, handle
[4:35] not, which all are to perish with the
[4:37] using after the commandments and
[4:39] doctrines of men." all all these all
[4:41] these weighty burdens that people put on
[4:43] one another to make to to bring a
[4:46] semblance of holiness, a semblance of
[4:48] being closer to God, which really
[4:50] accomplishes nothing, which is what Paul
[4:53] or Martin Luther found out. He beat
[4:55] himself all day long and and go without
[4:57] eating, you know, for for days or and
[5:02] and that ultimately accomplishes
[5:03] nothing. But it's it's it's Christ that
[5:06] can change the heart.
[5:08] So in in in uh verse 25, if we get into
[5:12] our lesson here, he said, 'Now
[5:13] concerning virgins, I have no
[5:16] commandment of the Lord, yet I give my
[5:18] judgment, as one that hath obtained
[5:20] mercy of the Lord to be faithful. I
[5:23] suppose, therefore, that this is good
[5:25] for the present distress, I say that it
[5:28] is good for a man so to be. Now if if
[5:32] you think historically about the time
[5:34] that they were living in uh he he was in
[5:37] Ephesus writing to the Corinthians. He
[5:39] had just met Aquilla and Priscilla in
[5:41] Corinth. They they had just got expelled
[5:44] from Rome by the emperor Claudius. And
[5:47] so Claudius said everybody all the
[5:49] Christians you got to get out. And and
[5:52] so he met Aquilla and Priscilla and they
[5:54] followed him back to Ephesus where he
[5:56] wrote his letter back to Corenth. And so
[5:58] they were all living in this time uh
[6:00] just before the the days of Emperor Nero
[6:02] where Nero really just poured out
[6:04] everything on them and started, you
[6:05] know, lighting people on fire in the
[6:08] streets and and uh putting people in the
[6:11] coliseums. It it was a it was a time uh
[6:14] maybe where people were kind of afraid
[6:17] to to really be public about what they
[6:19] believed. And and so so Paul's saying,
[6:22] you know, it's it's if if you get
[6:24] married, it's going to introduce
[6:26] additional complications. It's it's
[6:28] going to cause some additional things
[6:30] that you'll have to be concerned with.
[6:32] You know, if there uh I if if there's a
[6:34] chance that they might drag you or your
[6:37] wife or your children out in the street
[6:39] and beat your children to death in the
[6:41] street or throw them into a lion, then
[6:43] you have to, you know, take those things
[6:45] into account. uh you know because
[6:47] there's there's some some risk there. So
[6:50] are it's saying art thou bound unto a
[6:52] wife? Seek not to be loosed. Art thou
[6:54] loose from a wife. Seek not a wife.
[6:56] Maybe in your present condition. It it
[6:58] it just just
[7:00] just make wise decisions. Follow the
[7:03] leading of the Holy Spirit so that you
[7:05] in your present situation make make good
[7:08] choices. But if thou marry, thou hast
[7:11] not sinned. And if a virgin Mary, she
[7:13] hath not sinned. Nevertheless, such
[7:16] shall have trouble in the flesh, but I
[7:19] spare you. Now, now trouble in the
[7:21] flesh. If you He say, I'm I'm spare. I'm
[7:24] trying to give you a little heads up
[7:25] that if you get married, uh you know,
[7:28] sometimes young people think that it's
[7:29] just going to be all a bed of roses and
[7:31] you get married and there there's you're
[7:33] never going to argue. You're never going
[7:34] to have any trouble. That all of your
[7:35] problems will get solved as soon as you
[7:37] get married. But Paul's trying to frame
[7:39] it up like like you, in other words,
[7:41] would say it like this. You better pray
[7:43] before you get married. You you better
[7:46] enter into it with a leading of the Holy
[7:48] Ghost because if you don't and we'll see
[7:51] there's a quote where brother Random
[7:52] said uh being being married can be one
[7:55] of the best things in the world and it
[7:58] can also be one of the worst things in
[8:00] the world. And that's a statement that
[8:02] brother Brandon made. I'm I'm
[8:03] paraphrasing a little bit, but trouble
[8:06] in the flesh means that that even if
[8:08] you're a born again Christian, you you
[8:10] can run into situations and things uh
[8:13] because of
[8:15] of in other words, we'll frame it like
[8:17] this. Marriage brings earthly
[8:18] obligations that can compete with
[8:21] undivided devotion to the
[8:24] Lord. So Paul isn't trying to uh he he's
[8:27] not trashing marriage. He's warning
[8:30] about the reality of life under the
[8:32] curse. That trouble in the flesh means
[8:35] marriage will stretch you. It'll expose
[8:37] your weaknesses. It'll cost you comfort.
[8:39] It'll break your plans. It'll expose
[8:42] idols. So, in other words, if you think
[8:43] that you got to be the one that's that
[8:45] that is is the best and the highest and
[8:48] all that, that it sure will it sure will
[8:50] break all of those notions down and it
[8:53] will it will it will maybe make you
[8:55] force you to confront things and
[8:58] problems in your life because you're
[9:00] you're now you're you're you're living
[9:02] with somebody else and you got to
[9:03] reconcile your disagreements. You got to
[9:06] you got to work out what your weaknesses
[9:07] are. you got to work out. Um, you know,
[9:10] maybe maybe there's some nights I mean,
[9:12] let's be honest, look, some nights you
[9:15] might have to sleep on the couch or
[9:19] whatever because look, as you as your
[9:22] marriage grows, it's just like anything
[9:24] else. You you find your groove, right?
[9:26] We'll say it like that. You find your
[9:28] groove. You get into your slot. You you
[9:29] figure out how things work. But, you
[9:31] know, when you get started out, there's
[9:32] maybe you hit some rough patches and and
[9:35] and there's there's uh, you know, some
[9:38] some times where uh you you might, you
[9:41] know, argue over the money or have argue
[9:43] over the uh how you're where you're
[9:45] going to homeschool, whether you're
[9:46] going to homeschool your kids or put
[9:48] them in public school and and you got to
[9:50] work out differences and things. So, and
[9:52] that's what Paul means by trouble in the
[9:54] flesh. There's trouble that you can be
[9:56] you can be born again, but you still got
[9:58] those things that you got to work
[10:01] out. Every marital relationship will
[10:04] bring with it inevitable worldly
[10:06] difficulties and challenges. They're
[10:09] they're just simply part of the package.
[10:11] They're they're simply part of the
[10:12] package. Arguments, resentment,
[10:15] miscommunication, financial situations.
[10:19] uh that third bullet that you can read,
[10:21] parenting, stress, grief, health
[10:25] issues, you know, you uh you have all
[10:28] these situations in life that that
[10:30] divide your attention some many times
[10:32] away from God's work, emotional wear and
[10:35] tear tear from unresolved conflict. And
[10:38] so you know all these things kind of
[10:41] frame up that really to have a
[10:43] successful
[10:44] marriage you must have God at its
[10:48] center. Right. If if you don't have God
[10:51] at his center, then then
[10:55] uh you know, ministers since the the
[10:58] dawn of time have framed it up that if
[11:01] you're not born again when you get
[11:03] married, you're not really equipped to
[11:06] enter in to deal with all these
[11:09] situations. You know, like uh Wednesday
[11:11] night we were preaching on agapeo love
[11:13] that if you don't have that kind of
[11:14] sacrificial life that roots your life
[11:16] experience, how are you going to deal
[11:19] with with uh situations that require you
[11:21] to sacrifice yourself? How are you going
[11:24] to deal with situations that require you
[11:26] to to to maybe lay down your own
[11:30] will? How are you going to deal with a
[11:32] situation that requires you to sacrifice
[11:34] yourself for somebody else instead of
[11:36] putting yourself always first? Because
[11:38] that's that's what a real successful
[11:41] marriage requires is there's got to be
[11:42] give and take. You can't always be the
[11:45] one that that wins. You can't always be
[11:47] the one that, you know, puts the other
[11:49] person down and always gets your way.
[11:51] But sometimes you have to sacrifice for
[11:53] the other. The the whole thing the whole
[11:56] thing is based on sacrifice. A husband
[11:57] is sacrificing his time to go to work
[12:00] and labor for the family. And when he
[12:02] comes home, if if he's a real true
[12:05] father and man of God, he's going to
[12:07] sacrifice his time to get his little
[12:08] children around his knees and teach them
[12:10] the word of God. And the same thing with
[12:13] a mother. She's sacrificing her time and
[12:15] her will to to to do the things for her
[12:18] family and for her husband. And it's all
[12:21] wound up in the sacrifice that Christ
[12:23] made for us. So, you got to have Christ
[12:25] at the center of the home. And that that
[12:28] makes the trouble the trouble a whole
[12:30] lot less easier. When you got financial
[12:33] issues and you got money problems and
[12:35] school problems and you can just throw
[12:37] it all on Christ when you get on your
[12:39] knees in the middle of the night, then
[12:41] that makes the trouble a whole lot
[12:42] easier to bear. And you know, look, look
[12:45] at all that list of all the troubles.
[12:48] How could
[12:49] anybody makes you wonder how could
[12:51] people in the world deal with all these
[12:53] troubles? I I I see people even in my
[12:55] workplace almost breaking under the
[12:57] strain of just normal life situations
[13:00] that people people in their family have
[13:02] sickness or whatever and they're just
[13:04] just almost to break under it because
[13:05] they don't have what you and I have that
[13:08] that rock that we can we can throw all
[13:11] our burdens on that we can have
[13:12] confidence that that God is going to
[13:14] take if he can take care of a lily if he
[13:16] can take care of a barrier he's going to
[13:18] take care of you and I. Amen.
[13:21] So now, Brother Brown said in in uh
[13:23] marriage and divorce, he said, "Women
[13:26] struggle to be that. Come into Christ,
[13:29] then you'll not be in that filthy mess
[13:31] mess out there. But as long as you're
[13:33] just a church member trying to live
[13:35] moral and good yourself, you'll never
[13:37] make it. Neither can a man make it
[13:41] outside of
[13:42] Christ. You You can't make it outside of
[13:45] Christ." And and look, this is as soon
[13:47] as as soon as the trouble comes in a in
[13:49] a marriage that that and the devil wants
[13:52] there to be trouble because he can't
[13:54] marriage is everything. It it's the
[13:57] framework that God instituted in the
[13:59] Garden of Eden to to bring up uh to
[14:02] bring up children in the admonition of
[14:04] the Lord to to uh to continue to
[14:06] continue the gospel. And so the devil's
[14:09] just going to pour everything out on it.
[14:11] And what people do is they'll they'll
[14:13] they'll start thinking, well, I got
[14:14] trouble, so I'm just going to give up.
[14:16] Now, of course, in the world, everybody
[14:18] gives up and by getting divorced and
[14:19] everything, but uh many times, you know,
[14:21] you can be in a marriage where you're
[14:23] just you're just giving up and and
[14:25] staying together. And and to me, that's
[14:27] horrible. get you in instead of just
[14:30] going to God and and and and remembering
[14:33] that it takes a three-fold cord to have
[14:35] a happy a happy successful marriage. You
[14:38] can't do it on yourself by yourself with
[14:40] your own intellectuals. It takes God. So
[14:43] people give up. Now look what brother
[14:45] Ram said. He said, "Now watch this
[14:46] subject and questions and answers." You
[14:49] read on down and before this on through
[14:50] the chapter, you find that they thought
[14:52] if we married a wife and she was I got
[14:53] married and I become a believer and my
[14:55] wife wasn't a believer, let me put her
[14:57] away. Oh, no. That isn't it. You can't
[15:00] do that. So, in other words, don't give
[15:02] up. Don't don't give up. There's there's
[15:05] a God that that that made a promise. So
[15:08] many promises that we can take advantage
[15:10] of. Don't give up. And Martin Luther
[15:12] said, "There is no more lovely,
[15:14] friendly, and charming relationship,
[15:17] communion, or company than a good
[15:19] marriage." And he also said, "Satan
[15:22] always hates the joy of the godly and
[15:25] seeks to destroy it. And if there's one
[15:28] thing that the devil's got his target
[15:30] on, it's a happy, successful home where,
[15:34] you know, the peace of God reigns and
[15:36] the the children can come and feel feel
[15:39] loved and welcome. That's the one thing
[15:41] that the devil wants to he's going wants
[15:43] to put all his guns on destroying a
[15:46] happy successful marriage, a happy
[15:48] successful home. He wants to make
[15:50] everything chaos and discord when
[15:52] everybody's yelling at one another and
[15:53] screaming and and and has no
[15:55] relationship with God and and not
[15:57] reading their Bible. That that's that's
[15:59] what he he's he's about because it
[16:02] marriage was created by God. It reflects
[16:05] Christ in the church. It produces
[16:07] spiritual fruit. It restrains sin. It
[16:10] hands down the truth. So he he's going
[16:13] to go after it with temptation,
[16:14] resentment, infidelity, apathy, or
[16:17] spiritual division. everything that he
[16:18] can pour out on
[16:20] it. I'm going skip that slide, but you
[16:24] know, that's maybe a lot of pessimistic
[16:25] things, but I want to I want to say some
[16:27] optimistic things that two out of three
[16:31] unhappy couples who just stick it out.
[16:33] These are are scientifically proven
[16:36] facts. Two out of three unhappy couples
[16:39] who just stick it out report being
[16:40] happier five years later. Just don't
[16:43] give up. Just just keep keep at it.
[16:47] Married people are more likely to report
[16:49] being very happy than singles or
[16:52] cohabitors. Church attending couples
[16:54] divorce less and report higher
[16:57] satisfaction. Forgiveness in marriage
[17:00] dramatically improves long-term
[17:03] outcomes. And that's why we need Christ
[17:05] in our life. Amen. Because if you really
[17:08] have a heart of forgiveness, it's going
[17:10] to come from relationship with Christ.
[17:14] Oh, that well that's that's one of the
[17:16] things that'll really help your marriage
[17:17] if you can just throw throw that list to
[17:19] the side where you're keeping that tally
[17:22] sheet. Throw it to the side. And you
[17:23] know the best way to throw it to the
[17:25] side is where you just get along with
[17:26] God. Amen. And tell him all about it. If
[17:30] you need somebody to to to tell all
[17:32] about your troubles, don't get on the
[17:33] phone and gossip, but go tell it to God.
[17:36] He he's he's the best one to just owe
[17:38] and load on.
[17:40] Husbands who pray with their wives
[17:43] regularly have higher marital
[17:46] satisfaction. That is an article that I
[17:49] found on the web that is is just a
[17:52] scientifically pro proven fact that
[17:54] people just say that they pray with
[17:56] their wives have a more successful
[18:00] marriage. And ain't that
[18:02] something? And Jehovah Gyra, brother Ram
[18:05] said, I hope that every young man here
[18:07] when he gets married, he'll get a wife.
[18:09] and you'll live as happy together as
[18:11] wife and I have these 22 years that
[18:14] we've been
[18:15] married. He who has found a wife has
[18:18] found a good thing. As Solomon said, "A
[18:22] good woman is a jewel in a man's crown.
[18:25] An unrighteous one is water in his
[18:28] blood, and his bloodstream is his life.
[18:32] So an unrighteous one is the worst thing
[18:34] he can get a hold of and a righteous one
[18:38] is the best thing he can get a hold of
[18:41] outside of salvation. If God could have
[18:44] give a man a better thing than a wife,
[18:47] he would have give it to him cuz God
[18:50] just gives his children the good things
[18:53] and he gave him a wife and I'm thankful
[18:56] for it. I think that's one of the best
[18:58] quotes about marriage. you you know you
[19:01] you brothers now that that you got a
[19:03] real good wife that I'll tell you I'll
[19:05] tell you something that to really get on
[19:07] get her on your side if you tell her
[19:10] like like I tell my wife all the time I
[19:12] know that God loves me cuz he gave me
[19:14] you and you know it's it's one of the
[19:18] best things that God can give to
[19:20] somebody is a good wife cuz when you
[19:23] come home after a a hard day at work
[19:26] like I've said so many times and you've
[19:28] got that you know nice plate of food
[19:30] cooked for you and she greets you at the
[19:32] door with a kiss. And these things are
[19:35] not just parables. These are that I'm
[19:36] saying. These are these are real things
[19:38] that real godly wives do every day that
[19:41] they they're they're doing what the
[19:43] scripture says. They're doing what the
[19:45] the book of Proverbs says. And and and
[19:47] brother Brandham said, there ain't
[19:49] nothing outside of salvation that God
[19:52] can give you better than that. There
[19:53] ain't no cars, mansions, uh homes, uh
[19:57] streets of gold, anything better than a
[19:59] a good godly wife.
[20:03] So pray, pray hard before you get
[20:06] married. Any young people, pray. Don't
[20:09] don't just go into it half-hazard. Oh
[20:11] well, a lot of people have made
[20:12] decisions that didn't match up with
[20:15] scripture, so I'm just going to do it,
[20:16] too. No, you do what the scripture says,
[20:18] right? You do what the word of God says,
[20:20] cuz it matters. Look, what brother
[20:22] Bram's saying is that it can be the
[20:24] worst thing or it can be the best thing.
[20:29] And and honestly, it's hard to find a
[20:31] good in between, but we'll leave that
[20:33] over to the side. And the scripture
[20:35] says, "But if thou if thou marry, thou
[20:37] hast not sinned, and if a virgin
[20:39] marries, she hath not sinned.
[20:41] Nevertheless, such shall have trouble in
[20:44] the flesh, but I spare you." So, he's
[20:46] not discouraging marriage. He's
[20:48] demystifying it. Don't expect comfort
[20:51] without cost. You You're going to have
[20:52] to sacrifice something. If you want to
[20:55] be successful in anything, you got to
[20:57] sacrifice. Sacrifice that that pride.
[20:59] Sacrifice all that where I I bless God,
[21:02] I'm going to get my way. I don't care.
[21:04] You I I'll tell you what, marriage
[21:07] marriage will will teach you that you've
[21:09] got to lay some things down. Don't
[21:11] pretend that it's easier than it is. It
[21:14] It's not easy because you've got to
[21:16] you've got to sacrifice. Amen. But don't
[21:18] despise it either because it's all part
[21:21] of God's
[21:23] design. So, here's some wisdom from Paul
[21:25] for how a marriage how how to have a
[21:28] marriage that endures to to kind of do
[21:31] away with all that trouble in the flesh.
[21:34] Put Christ first always, not your
[21:38] spouse. And this is what Paul said in 1
[21:40] Corinthians 7 that we were just reading.
[21:43] I would have you without carefulness
[21:45] that ye may attend upon the Lord without
[21:48] distraction. Now, that's the main thing
[21:50] that Paul's trying to say. I want to set
[21:52] you up so that no matter whether you're
[21:54] married or single, whatever your state
[21:56] is, whatever your job is, that you're
[21:58] putting God first above everything. I I
[22:01] if you're single and you're able to
[22:03] spend hours in prayer and hours alone
[22:05] with God, and then you get married and
[22:06] all that stops, then that's that's not
[22:08] right. Make sure that you're putting
[22:11] putting God first no matter what. Put
[22:14] God first above everything
[22:17] else. Now, here's some more wisdom. Men,
[22:20] you you got to die. You die first. You
[22:23] serve first. And And to be strong, no
[22:25] wine and no ego. You just take up that
[22:27] cross and you carry it for your family.
[22:30] Like Paul said in Ephesians chapter 5,
[22:32] "Husbands, love your wives even as
[22:35] Christ also loved the church and gave
[22:37] himself for it." And and the way Christ
[22:40] loved the church was he took up that
[22:41] cross and and gave everything. He gave
[22:44] everything. And to frame it up like
[22:46] that, that's how a godly husband has got
[22:48] to be to their wife and to their family.
[22:51] They got to give everything.
[22:53] Everything every no no sacrifice for
[22:57] your family. You know what? What an
[23:00] infidel you would be if your family was
[23:02] starving and you would not get up and go
[23:04] to work. What an infidel you would be if
[23:07] you did not prepare for tomorrow. If if
[23:09] you did not prepare to provide for your
[23:12] family so that they had what they had
[23:13] need of. You you've got to do it's it's
[23:16] an obligation of every man to do
[23:18] whatever it takes to provide to do to do
[23:22] to give them spiritually and
[23:25] naturally. And to the wife, respect is
[23:28] not optional. In Ephesians chapter 5,
[23:31] Paul said, "Let the wife see that she
[23:33] reverence her
[23:34] husband." And think eternally, not
[23:37] emotionally. This chapter we've been
[23:39] reading from, you could almost say 1
[23:41] Corinthians chapter 7 is the it's it's
[23:43] the marriage and divorce
[23:45] chapter. The time is short, it remainth,
[23:48] that both they that have wives be as
[23:51] though they had
[23:52] none. So, in other words, he's saying
[23:55] again, don't don't think about the
[23:57] problems and the stress. Don't dwell on
[23:59] those things so much, but think think
[24:01] beyond that. Don't let it get to a place
[24:04] where you're building up resentment
[24:05] toward one another and you you just, you
[24:08] know, I I I can't stand to be in the
[24:10] same room with her. But but think
[24:12] eternally. Think think to a place where,
[24:14] you know, you you just you're you're
[24:17] you're thinking about your relationship
[24:19] with God and and all of those things.
[24:23] Sanctify. Don't sabotage.
[24:26] 1 Corinthians ch 7 again Paul said the
[24:28] unbelieving husband is sanctified by the
[24:31] wife. The unbelieving spouse is
[24:34] sanctified by the other. And always be
[24:37] quick to forgive. Be ye kind one to
[24:40] another, tenderhearted, forgiving one
[24:43] another, even as God for Christ's sake
[24:45] hath forgiven you. Amen.
[24:49] Now to sum it all up, Paul says in
[24:51] Ephesians 5:33, he said, "Nevertheless,
[24:53] let every one of you in particular, so
[24:55] love his wife, even as himself, and the
[24:59] wife see that she reverence her
[25:01] husband." What is it? What is it women
[25:04] want? They want love. They want They
[25:06] want to be told how much their cooking
[25:08] is good. They want to be told how pretty
[25:10] they are. They want to be told how
[25:12] valuable they are to you. And what is it
[25:15] women want? Men want respect. It's the
[25:19] worst thing in the world for a man to
[25:20] come home from working hard all day and
[25:22] get no respect. To to try to take a nap
[25:25] in the afternoon and you know that
[25:27] nobody's
[25:31] well, you know what? Well, that's that
[25:33] that's what that's what men want is
[25:35] respect and women want love. Men don't
[25:37] men don't want love so much. They just
[25:39] want to be respected. They want to be
[25:41] regarded as their head of the house.
[25:44] Even if they make a goofy decision, you
[25:46] still got to respect them. That's what
[25:48] they want. Even if they do something
[25:49] boneheaded, they they they you know, uh
[25:52] work it out. Come to a place where you
[25:54] can still respect them. Cuz that's
[25:56] that's the difference between men and
[25:58] women. Women men want respect and women
[26:01] won't
[26:02] love. Isn't that something that the
[26:04] Bible actually answers the question,
[26:06] well, what do women
[26:08] want? They they want love. and and
[26:13] uh we'll just keep
[26:17] reading. Verse 29. But this I say,
[26:20] brethren, the time is short. It remainth
[26:23] that both they that have wives be as
[26:25] though they had none, and they that weep
[26:28] as though they wept not, and they that
[26:30] rejoice as though they rejoice not, and
[26:33] they that buy as though they possess
[26:35] not. And they that use this world is not
[26:38] abusing it. for the fashion of this
[26:40] world passeth away. But I would have you
[26:43] without carefulness. He that is
[26:45] unmarried carth for the things that
[26:47] belong to the world to the Lord to the
[26:50] Lord how he may please the Lord. But he
[26:52] that is married carth for the things
[26:55] that are of the world how he may please
[26:58] his
[27:01] wife. Now what what's he saying as we've
[27:04] kind of belabored the point? Just no
[27:06] matter what your state is, no matter
[27:08] what your situation is, just make sure
[27:10] that you care about God. Make sure that
[27:13] you're not leaving the main thing to the
[27:15] side, but you always put God first. And
[27:18] there might be trouble in the flesh.
[27:20] There might be problems. There might
[27:21] you're going to have trouble. You're
[27:23] you're you unavoidable because life is
[27:25] just full of troubles. Life is full of
[27:27] situations. Life is full of problems.
[27:30] But if you put God before everything,
[27:33] that will make the troubles, if they
[27:36] don't completely go away, it sure will
[27:38] help a lot. And and I'll say before as
[27:41] we close, as the musicians come, you
[27:43] cannot navigate these troubles without
[27:45] God in your life. It's impossible to
[27:48] navigate all these troubles because
[27:49] you've got to have God to sacrifice, to
[27:52] yield yourself, and to truly love to
[27:55] take you beyond just filio love to real
[27:58] agapo love. that love that can sacrifice
[28:01] everything for the other person. God
[28:04] bless you saints. Amen.
[28:08] [Applause]
