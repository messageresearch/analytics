[0:00] yeah
[0:02] okay good to see you everybody today
[0:07] Gary's face
[0:09] Revelations five we're gonna read it and
[0:11] hope you rocks your book because we're
[0:12] going to read out of the book today
[0:14] sir
[0:16] okay
[0:20] Revelation chapter five
[0:23] that's all in the right hand of him that
[0:24] sat on the throne of book written within
[0:26] and on the backside seal was seven
[0:28] sealed
[0:30] I saw a strong Angel Proclaim with the
[0:32] loud voice who is worthy to open the
[0:34] book and to loose the seal if they're up
[0:36] and no man this is man no man was Worthy
[0:41] no man in Heaven Nor in Earth
[0:43] neither under the Earth was able to open
[0:45] the book needed to look their own
[0:48] and I went much because no man was found
[0:50] worthy to open and read the book needed
[0:52] to look their own
[0:54] one of the older Senator to me we've not
[0:56] behold the line of the tribe of Judah
[0:58] and the root of David
[1:00] has prevailed to open the book and at
[1:02] least the Seven Seals thereof
[1:04] I'll be held in law in the midst of the
[1:06] Throne of the four beasts in the midst
[1:07] of the elders through the lamb as they
[1:09] had been slain having seven horns seven
[1:11] eyes which of the seventh Pierce from
[1:13] God sent forth into all the Earth and he
[1:15] came and took the book out of the right
[1:17] hand of him to settle on the throne
[1:19] we'll stop right there now let's go to
[1:21] our books
[1:23] and let's all just remember Brother Dean
[1:26] this morning you just came on my heart
[1:27] just now and he's really having a
[1:30] struggle with and your pastor Daddy's
[1:33] got something strong yeah
[1:35] eyes are all red and he's talking like
[1:37] book Edition
[1:40] the Brother Dean they think he has
[1:42] aneurysm and that's what's making his
[1:45] eyes and now his head's hurting so same
[1:48] God that broke all of us through what we
[1:50] had time
[1:54] that's what we're trying to see here you
[1:56] know I read
[1:57] you read this the book was
[2:02] book was written where Within
[2:06] and on the back side
[2:09] all right Within
[2:12] books written within and on the back
[2:14] side inside and out right this is for
[2:17] the Redemption of the whole man not just
[2:19] for the soul all right so keep that in
[2:21] mind
[2:22] yeah
[2:24] let's go to paragraph let's see if we
[2:27] can hold that paragraph together
[2:28] paragraph 11.
[2:32] brother Ryan was talking about the
[2:34] vision of the Angel and then he's going
[2:37] to make that commentary and then we're
[2:39] going to read the same thing
[2:42] you got to get the breach
[2:46] we are in the bridge
[2:49] yeah paragraph 11. says and I was
[2:52] standing there in prayer
[2:55] everybody say amen amen okay all right
[2:59] the reason I'm setting this as a basis
[3:01] is because I know we know brother
[3:03] randomly prophet of the end time but he
[3:06] come to a place to where God trusted him
[3:09] with something and that's the same place
[3:12] you and I have to come in
[3:14] God's got to trust us with something he
[3:16] said they're fine
[3:20] Simplicity and then the brief 60 if you
[3:23] got a book like mine yes yes
[3:36] I really thought he'd get off but I
[3:39] think maybe the black one in this one is
[3:40] the same yeah but the hardbound one that
[3:43] I've got the older one it's not they're
[3:45] all about it
[3:47] yeah okay all right
[3:50] page 60 of the breach paragraph 11. I
[3:54] will stand in there in prayer and
[3:55] something happened now something fell in
[3:57] my hand and I know if you don't
[3:58] understand spiritual things it may seem
[4:00] very strange something struck in my hand
[4:02] and when I looked it was a short
[4:05] it's described what it is and I looked
[4:07] down a little bit further word he said
[4:09] it was the prettiest thing I ever seen
[4:11] it fit my hand exactly
[4:14] okay see that I underlined that that
[4:16] that's the word
[4:18] what he said
[4:20] fit his hand exactly that sword was a
[4:23] type of the word right
[4:25] and it fit his hand it wasn't made for
[4:27] somebody else it was made for him but
[4:29] now when he took that sword
[4:32] read on over a little further 61 because
[4:34] this is something you and I got to see
[4:35] this is redemption this is not talking
[4:37] about what a prophet brought
[4:41] let me finish my statement
[4:43] people can't believe brother Brown and
[4:45] brought the revelation of the seals and
[4:46] die and go to hell
[4:50] you know emphatically state
[4:53] he opened the seal
[4:55] and if you're not born again and if you
[4:58] don't have this same experience not an
[4:59] experience with a literal sword coming
[5:01] down he had to do that because he was a
[5:03] prophet right prophets do things by
[5:06] types right symbols so when that sword
[5:10] came down and it fit his hand perfect
[5:13] he said it fit my hand perfect
[5:15] but
[5:17] 14.
[5:19] all right go to 14. paragraph 14. in
[5:24] dueling you see I don't understand I
[5:25] don't understand one word of it but one
[5:27] principle of dueling but the best of my
[5:29] understanding the knife striking across
[5:31] and finally the storage if they lock the
[5:34] enemy you lock the sword like this then
[5:36] it takes the strength of the man doing
[5:38] the dueling
[5:40] so in other words you're doing somebody
[5:42] and you got the best sword in the world
[5:44] if you ain't got the strength to hold on
[5:46] to it
[5:48] right because you'll watch those fencing
[5:50] when they when they fence you know they
[5:51] fence like this and then well when that
[5:53] store when they lock those swords like
[5:55] this they come up real close to each
[5:56] other
[5:58] you got to be strong enough to push that
[5:59] guy away and then do this you know all
[6:01] right that's what he's talking about
[6:02] then it takes the strength of the man
[6:05] Dooley
[6:06] because see his sword will be pointed at
[6:08] my heart
[6:10] and mine to his
[6:14] but they're locked as are not
[6:16] obstructing each other and then they
[6:17] strike and then the storage come
[6:19] together
[6:20] the one that can shove the other one
[6:21] down the sword is straight to the heart
[6:23] so it takes even though the sword be the
[6:26] word
[6:28] right even though the stored be the word
[6:32] it takes the hand of strong faith to
[6:35] hold it there to bring it to the heart
[6:37] of the enemy now that's exactly what he
[6:39] did
[6:40] when he was God had to bring him to that
[6:42] place to where he could have that strong
[6:45] hand of faith and that's what you and I
[6:47] are going to have to have a strong hand
[6:48] of faith
[6:49] because no man is Worthy
[6:54] let's go back to Revelation 5. no man is
[6:56] worthy to do this
[6:58] but yeah that's good William Branham the
[7:00] man
[7:01] but it was a strong hand of Faith
[7:03] remember he was in a vision basically
[7:05] but it was a reality to him right but
[7:08] that's going to happen to you and I
[7:09] we've got to take a strong hand of faith
[7:11] and do the same thing
[7:13] all right
[7:14] and that's what happened to him
[7:17] Revelations 5 he comes in and says Okay
[7:20] God says this is the sword of the king
[7:25] not only do you have to have to fit your
[7:28] hand
[7:29] but you also got to have enough strong
[7:31] faith to put it to the heart of the
[7:33] enemy all right
[7:34] so in other words we've had the word for
[7:36] a long time
[7:37] right in our possession in our hands
[7:41] but now you we're gonna have to do
[7:43] something that has never been done
[7:44] before the enemies always struck to our
[7:48] uh flesh heart
[7:50] physical heart because we're dying right
[7:54] that's everywhere
[7:57] well that's Satan he's took that sword
[7:59] and he's had a stronger hand because of
[8:01] what happened in the garden he's been a
[8:03] squatter
[8:05] but he's not the mighty conqueror that's
[8:07] right
[8:09] you can't get to your spiritual heart
[8:11] but he can take that natural heart down
[8:13] right right man's hearts are failing for
[8:16] fear you know the Bible says in the end
[8:17] time and you see people fall right and
[8:19] left even young people now that are
[8:22] dying heart attacks and things like that
[8:24] that's right
[8:29] but it takes a strong hand of faith
[8:32] to bring it to the heart of the enemy so
[8:34] what we're doing we're getting it back
[8:36] we're getting our full Authority back
[8:39] right and that's what he's to me what
[8:42] brother random does now it's not brother
[8:43] random it's really God
[8:45] it's the Holy Ghost talking to me and
[8:48] you right right because remember these
[8:50] people sitting here listening to this
[8:52] message right here did not understand
[8:54] anything this man was talking about
[8:55] right now that's not my opinion we're
[8:59] going to read over here in questions and
[9:01] answers
[9:01] where he said you're not getting it
[9:04] not supposed to and it's already left
[9:06] you right
[9:08] it's already left you
[9:13] right and the questions and answers when
[9:15] he first started talking he said in
[9:17] paragraph 13 all of your conscious and
[9:19] know that there is something mysterious
[9:21] happening and it is happening and I know
[9:23] what it is now I'm just not saying that
[9:25] it's the grace of God that lets me know
[9:27] what it is
[9:28] it's something that's tremendous and
[9:30] it's gone right now
[9:32] and there's no way in the world for you
[9:34] to see it right so this was written to
[9:37] me and you specifically
[9:41] right
[9:43] all the people that are dead can't read
[9:44] that of course the people 1965 till now
[9:47] has read it
[9:49] that died
[9:51] not ashamed we're in disgrace
[9:54] but there's somebody gonna have to take
[9:55] this once this Prophet said that's right
[9:57] and not mimic it but be it all right
[10:01] because you're going to read we're going
[10:03] to read in the questions and answers
[10:04] maybe we'll do that next Sunday
[10:06] the questions and answers before he gets
[10:08] started
[10:09] he made some very outstanding statements
[10:12] but what he was doing he what brother
[10:14] Brown would do what God would do through
[10:15] this Prophet was he'd build a foundation
[10:18] remember reservable supposed to build a
[10:20] foundation right now you don't just
[10:22] leave the foundation where it is
[10:25] they didn't go Enoch didn't go take that
[10:27] pyramid and just build a foundation and
[10:29] then leave he built a building on top of
[10:32] it right all right that's what God's
[10:34] going to do he's going to build a
[10:35] building on top of it the statue of a
[10:37] perfect man but that building can't be
[10:39] complete without the cop sitting on it
[10:41] and that's what's been gone and left
[10:43] after all all the years but what God
[10:46] does in this book more than any that I
[10:48] see
[10:49] all right and God is Simplicity God is
[10:53] planting a seed amen it's going to be
[10:55] simple
[10:57] all right in the breach he's showing you
[11:00] that it's Redemption
[11:03] then he begins to open the seals and
[11:05] then he opens one comes back and tells
[11:08] you about one on number two and then he
[11:10] opens two comes back and tells you what
[11:11] he's doing he's coming back on that
[11:13] Foundation again laying it he's not
[11:15] laying it again
[11:16] he's just building on top of it right
[11:18] that's right remember Paul said not
[11:20] laying again the foundation of water
[11:22] baptism and all that when brother Brown
[11:24] gets to this he's past that
[11:27] that's why he's saying questions and
[11:28] answers he said I'm sure you're not
[11:29] getting it coach one of the questions
[11:30] we're still on water baptism should I
[11:32] wear a pajamas to bed
[11:35] you know the greatest time in the face
[11:36] of history since Jesus Christ has been
[11:38] on Earth that one week was the greatest
[11:40] time in history and they're asking about
[11:42] wearing pajamas to bed
[11:44] so it probably gave him a very very
[11:49] um humbling and uh to me I'd have
[11:52] probably threw up my hands and left but
[11:54] the thing that hurt me was he
[11:56] specifically asked he said ask questions
[11:59] right about what we're talking about
[12:01] this week and he got one or two out of
[12:04] 25. maybe the pajama
[12:07] right
[12:10] the pajama lady wasn't there
[12:12] but you know brother Brown will listen
[12:14] to The Prophet though he says
[12:17] this is serious he said there he said
[12:20] every question is important and he
[12:21] answered every one of them at length he
[12:25] didn't just say all that so Steely y'all
[12:26] wear what you know he covered it in
[12:28] length you know about you know this and
[12:31] that you know today whatever you wear in
[12:33] your bedroom
[12:35] that's your business you just don't do
[12:36] it outside don't think I know you're not
[12:38] supposed to wear a garment thing to a
[12:39] man all right so that's all he said all
[12:42] right so but watch what he's doing here
[12:45] in this Revelation chapter five he's
[12:47] building a foundation
[12:49] and God is building it through this
[12:51] Prophet by putting a sword in his hand
[12:54] telling us what it's going to taste he's
[12:56] gone in God in Simplicity is telling us
[13:00] how to defeat the Devil wherein back in
[13:03] the old times where there wasn't enough
[13:04] word to do that you didn't have a
[13:06] prophet on the scene
[13:08] man was doing just what brother Adam
[13:11] said they were floundering around they
[13:12] were presuming well maybe this is right
[13:15] well maybe that's right well we're going
[13:17] to baptize this way we're going to
[13:19] baptize this way we're going to believe
[13:21] that three God three Gods one God but
[13:23] when you come down to this man right
[13:25] here
[13:25] during that week that breach is
[13:28] important because that breach is part of
[13:30] the foundation right If You Don't See
[13:33] Redemption in the seal you have missed
[13:35] every bit of it and they didn't see that
[13:37] in here they just saw that he realized
[13:41] and now we know that the white horse
[13:43] rider is not the Holy Ghost it's the
[13:45] devil
[13:47] it's a lot deeper than that because you
[13:49] can read that
[13:50] with your brain
[13:52] but remember he told us this was a love
[13:54] book read between the lines
[13:56] okay love letter okay and this was a
[13:59] love letter that that
[14:01] God brought which was the Bible but then
[14:03] he gave us Grace and brought us a
[14:05] prophet
[14:07] to where he could literally read between
[14:08] the lines
[14:10] now we got to read between his lines
[14:13] but it's got to be the same on top the
[14:14] same on the bottom it can't be a
[14:16] different Revelation that's right okay
[14:19] this book The Sound of silk did not
[14:20] bring something called polygamy and all
[14:22] that other junk that they're talking
[14:23] about in the message
[14:25] it brought Redemption to this
[14:29] by from this Bible to me and you and
[14:31] made it alive that's what it's supposed
[14:33] to do right so that's why he did this
[14:35] with brother Brown and put that strong
[14:37] hand of faith strong sword then he
[14:40] begins and says in in number 19 he says
[14:44] because I do not know what the first
[14:46] runner is I don't know the second third
[14:48] fourth fifth sixth or seventh seal all
[14:51] right
[14:57] and now if you'll catch something else
[15:00] look at look at paragraph 20 should be
[15:03] on page 62 right at the top of the page
[15:05] he says you know in Visions you cannot
[15:08] reveal things until they are permitted
[15:09] to reveal
[15:10] now remember he'd have a vision of
[15:12] somebody in a room and there'd be two
[15:14] people in the room
[15:15] and they would be a hat laying on the
[15:17] couch
[15:18] well he'd walk into that room naturally
[15:21] and he see the two people but he didn't
[15:23] see the hat right
[15:24] so he just sat down and started talking
[15:26] to the people maybe he said the baby was
[15:28] crying and all that stuff and just
[15:30] barely breathing and all that stuff but
[15:31] he could not do anything until that
[15:33] vision
[15:34] go ahead Vision was complete
[15:38] in other words until what God saw
[15:41] because what what is a vision is
[15:43] foretelling something it's going to take
[15:45] place well where'd that come from that
[15:46] had to come from the mind of God if it
[15:48] was from God Visions are not always from
[15:50] God
[15:51] but this Vision was right because it was
[15:53] in the word
[15:54] so he said you know he waited about 10
[15:56] minutes 15 minutes and finally somebody
[15:59] walks in
[16:00] takes his hat off lays it on account he
[16:04] says okay the vision's complete and he
[16:06] said now I can pray for the baby
[16:08] say West same thing with this right here
[16:10] every part's got to be in its place
[16:13] for these seals to have opened and that
[16:15] why do you think he starts talking about
[16:17] stuff like that
[16:18] because he's telling us something
[16:21] because look keep reading you know
[16:22] invisions you cannot reveal things until
[16:24] they are permitted to reveal how many
[16:26] times have you all heard me say go into
[16:28] a house perhaps a hat laying here and
[16:29] this certain child so forth will not be
[16:31] healed until that's late over here I
[16:33] cannot tell them or neither can I move
[16:36] it there
[16:37] it's got to be moving some other way
[16:40] somebody else
[16:43] he's telling us he can't do it
[16:47] he's telling us right here he cannot
[16:49] physically go move that hat someone else
[16:51] has to do it he physically cannot reveal
[16:54] this to you you got to get it right you
[16:57] got to put the hat in the right place
[16:59] and you know what unconsciously the man
[17:02] moved the Hat it wasn't cause
[17:04] it wasn't because he was part of the
[17:07] vision and he knew if he didn't move I
[17:08] have no the guy that walked in or the
[17:10] lady or whoever was they picked that hat
[17:12] up and moved it they were just doing it
[17:14] by night they were just being natural
[17:16] I said God is simplicity
[17:22] exactly yeah exactly because what is the
[17:25] vision it's showing something that was
[17:27] in God's mind before the foundational
[17:28] world if it's of God
[17:31] because God's already saw it happen
[17:33] right you and I cannot look in the
[17:34] future and see something that hasn't
[17:35] happened we're not capable as human
[17:37] beings to do that right
[17:39] all right but God's already seen it so
[17:42] he just brought the prophet brought him
[17:43] up a little higher than everybody else
[17:45] so he could see out and dropped him down
[17:48] and said hey
[17:49] this has got to happen before this is
[17:51] gonna this baby can't be healed it's not
[17:53] that the baby's healing was based on the
[17:55] hat but it was the situation
[17:59] the atmosphere that was created the the
[18:01] the play that the act of the play so all
[18:05] these people had to be in the right
[18:06] place right see you know what was wrong
[18:09] with this right here
[18:11] the people weren't in the right place
[18:13] I said the people weren't in the right
[18:15] place
[18:16] you and I weren't sitting there most of
[18:19] us were not born
[18:20] I was but most of y'all weren't born
[18:23] okay 1965 63 I mean
[18:26] but that was the problem
[18:29] that's what he's telling the people he
[18:32] said if you're spiritual all during the
[18:33] whole week he said you were he said if
[18:35] you're watching you'll know what I'm
[18:36] doing what was he doing
[18:38] he was telling them
[18:40] listen somebody else has to take it and
[18:43] move it and everything in order then it
[18:47] can be revealed
[18:50] all right so now be in prayer
[18:53] so he starts praying okay now 23
[18:59] now now we're going to turn to the fifth
[19:01] chapter now this is not the seven seal
[19:03] just to breach between the church ages
[19:04] and the seventh seal
[19:06] we're talking about Tom yesterday and
[19:08] it's true it's a very true statement the
[19:10] seals and the ages compare to each other
[19:13] they don't parallel
[19:15] one's not one twos not two threes not
[19:17] three
[19:18] right you understand yes seal one
[19:20] parallels really one two and three right
[19:24] okay seal number two parallel when the
[19:27] in the Dark Ages seal three parallels in
[19:30] Lutheran Wesley seal four in this age
[19:32] because Rapture takes place on the
[19:34] fourth seal so we're getting way ahead
[19:36] of ourselves so just erase that out of
[19:37] your mind jury
[19:39] thank you
[19:42] those lawyers are smart how are you
[19:44] going to raise that at your memory
[19:46] you'll remember it now so we get
[19:48] finished in December of 2012. right now
[19:53] keep that in your mind
[19:56] because that's what it's coming to all
[19:58] right
[20:00] it's not the seven seal just a breach
[20:01] between the church ages and the seventh
[20:03] seal so the seals were shown down
[20:06] Through the Ages
[20:07] so brother Brown had to bring the breach
[20:09] because debris what happened during the
[20:11] ages there was one common factor in all
[20:13] the ages
[20:15] the word was revealed to a group of
[20:17] people and they were born again
[20:19] to me that you can just ask your that's
[20:21] your foundation for us to talk about
[20:24] but their body was not redeemed
[20:27] but the seals open and the ages showing
[20:29] that white horse rider riding out
[20:32] making everybody religious
[20:35] the Red Horse Road out killing the ones
[20:37] that that were you know that were
[20:39] against the Catholic Church
[20:41] number three coming out with death which
[20:43] was during Lutheran Wesley's time it was
[20:45] spiritual death more than natural death
[20:47] all right and then in the end time here
[20:51] we are with all of them mixed together
[20:54] and we had a prophet tell us his name
[20:56] his name's death which is what anti-word
[20:59] Antichrist
[21:01] anti against the word of God right so
[21:03] that's what he's trying to that's what
[21:05] I'm telling you now so you can set a
[21:07] foundation
[21:09] excuse me to where when we go start into
[21:11] the breach which is now you'll see that
[21:14] this is all the foundation for the seal
[21:15] that doesn't have anything to do with
[21:17] co123 but without this breach you can't
[21:20] get into the seal
[21:22] you got to be born again to understand
[21:24] right okay so you gotta have Redemption
[21:27] right
[21:28] and that's the common factor in all the
[21:30] church ages
[21:32] um this one had a word for the day this
[21:34] one this other one had a word different
[21:35] not a different word but a different
[21:37] part of the word you understand what I'm
[21:38] saying when I say a different word it's
[21:40] not a different word it's just more of
[21:41] it and then it got to eat down to less
[21:43] of it right okay it wasn't that they
[21:46] they throw the Bibles away no what
[21:48] happened was people began to preach
[21:50] their own Doctrine
[21:51] and that eroded the word of God to where
[21:54] people couldn't it just made it just it
[21:56] made a uh a crust around people so you
[21:59] got in uh Columbus age
[22:02] that it almost went completely out why
[22:04] Catholic church trying to kill all 68
[22:06] million Protestant all right
[22:08] um
[22:09] and then it started back in Lutheran
[22:11] Westland all right so in this breach
[22:14] brother Branham had to breach the church
[22:17] ages to the seals
[22:20] all right when he brought that in then
[22:22] he brought it together then he could
[22:23] start on the first seal the angel could
[22:25] come down on on that date and give him
[22:29] the Revelation all right now let's go to
[22:35] let's do 24 because he's he's getting
[22:38] these things out of the way watch him he
[22:40] he's he's wiping that Foundation off
[22:42] but somebody some people in the message
[22:44] use this Foundation very wrong
[22:47] and there was a fourth chapter rather of
[22:49] Revelations
[22:51] and in that it kind of revealed
[22:52] something that would take place after
[22:54] the church going up
[22:56] the church goes up in the third chapter
[22:58] of Revelations and does not return to
[22:59] the 19th Chapter of Revelation therefore
[23:02] the church misses the tribulation right
[23:04] so the literal happenings from from
[23:07] chapter four
[23:09] actually it starts from chapter six
[23:11] because remember four and five is the
[23:13] scene in heaven it's already finished
[23:15] John's caught up through the open door
[23:17] right right
[23:19] shown the bride shown the four at four
[23:22] 20 Elders the Beast all that the the the
[23:25] four combat beasts shows all that in
[23:27] four like I've always said I'll say it
[23:29] again chapter at the end of chapter
[23:31] three when you start chapter four that
[23:33] tells of the rapture
[23:35] chapter 4 shows us in heaven chapter
[23:39] five shows us how we got there
[23:43] you say how chapter 4 shows us around
[23:45] the throne praising God throwing our
[23:48] crowns down doing all that it's done
[23:50] it's finished it's over
[23:52] then God goes and says hey this is the
[23:55] reason you were here he goes back to
[23:58] Revelation 5 and goes back to John where
[24:00] there's no man Worthy
[24:02] in other words he's saying the reason
[24:04] you got here
[24:06] you aren't worthy that was one man
[24:09] Worthy
[24:10] Jesus Christ and that's the one that
[24:12] we're seeing going around the throne in
[24:14] chapter four raising and throwing our
[24:16] crowns and screaming and hollering but
[24:19] John had to see total redemption in
[24:21] chapter five
[24:23] because remember John was a born-again
[24:25] believer
[24:27] John was a born-again Believer from 80
[24:29] 33 to 1890 that was 60 some odd years
[24:33] remember he was a little young boy when
[24:34] Jesus picked him probably 17 18 years
[24:38] old in 1833 or 80 30 when Jesus was
[24:41] crucified all right
[24:43] so 60 years later
[24:45] he's probably 78 or 80 years old out
[24:47] there on this island going through all
[24:48] this
[24:50] so he had been born again for 60 years
[24:54] yet he's weeping
[24:56] he's born again
[24:58] he's in heaven
[25:00] he's being caught up to the greatest
[25:01] event in history
[25:05] but he's caught crying
[25:07] weak not John
[25:10] your body's gonna make it
[25:14] see that's a lot in Revelation 5 that
[25:16] you can you can body change is in there
[25:19] all those things that's in Revelation 5.
[25:21] that's why brother Brown said we had to
[25:22] get to this it's breach
[25:25] to get our mind really now listen to me
[25:28] to the end to get our mind out of the
[25:31] ages
[25:32] because remember if you're a bride today
[25:34] we're caught up out of the age right
[25:36] we're not in this age we're in this age
[25:38] physically but we're going to be caught
[25:39] up out of the age
[25:41] to understand that it's not just
[25:44] getting born again and living a good
[25:46] Christian life anymore that's what he
[25:48] told them to do in 1963. remember he
[25:50] said go on live a good simple Christian
[25:53] Life
[25:55] pay your time go to church that's good
[25:57] we do that but we are required a little
[26:00] bit more amen
[26:02] that's to see that where John was
[26:04] weeping he was weeping because no man
[26:06] was worthy there was no flesh
[26:10] flesh
[26:12] Worthy
[26:13] that's why when he turned to see a lion
[26:15] he saw what Jesus Christ the son of man
[26:19] he was the bloody lamb the son of man
[26:21] right and when he saw him take that book
[26:26] he knew it was back in the hands of the
[26:29] rifle owner right remember God took it
[26:32] away from Adam
[26:34] the ability to produce us
[26:36] in flesh bodies to become Eternal
[26:39] correct
[26:40] God held on to that book
[26:42] until this passage of scripture
[26:46] that was God setting on that throne
[26:48] right Son of God Spirit God down Through
[26:51] the Ages
[26:53] then the lamb comes out from behind the
[26:55] throne the prophet said back in his
[26:58] mediatorial work what being a mediator
[27:00] between what God and man
[27:04] scripture says it's a man Christ Jesus
[27:06] what would Prophet said he was down
[27:08] through the church ages bringing out a
[27:10] bride but when he comes around and takes
[27:12] that book see that's a little different
[27:15] because when he takes the book he's in
[27:17] full possession of it then that's right
[27:18] all power
[27:21] in Heaven and Earth has been given unto
[27:24] me
[27:25] Jesus was prophesying of what was
[27:28] happening to himself
[27:31] and then also a group of people because
[27:33] after that they had a Pentecostal
[27:35] Revival right because John saw that if
[27:39] one man was Worthy
[27:41] then everybody that believed on that man
[27:43] God wrote part of the scripture remember
[27:45] John wrote the Book of John and little
[27:48] John so he knew something about what
[27:49] Jesus was about but when he saw that man
[27:52] take that book he knew the hand the book
[27:54] was back in the hand of the rifle owner
[27:57] now he took ages to get there that was
[28:00] 80 60 something or 80 90. and now we're
[28:03] in 2011.
[28:06] but it took a long time
[28:09] to get a group of people on the Earth
[28:12] that would believe it
[28:15] a group of people that would believe
[28:17] that in Revelations 5 it's not just four
[28:20] in your soul because remember blinded
[28:22] John that's important why did John weep
[28:26] why we wouldn't you know today we
[28:28] Rejoice because we're born again right
[28:30] right but when John was in a vision
[28:32] seeing that that if somebody didn't get
[28:35] that book back
[28:37] see John live way back in the Book of
[28:39] Genesis he was way back there in the
[28:41] book right
[28:42] way back there in God's mind remember he
[28:44] was caught up John was caught up right
[28:46] to see what was
[28:49] what is and what is to come right so he
[28:53] saw what was
[28:55] he saw what happened in the garden he
[28:57] knew what happened in the garden he read
[28:58] the scroll
[29:00] he was a born-again believer
[29:04] but he saw people still dying
[29:09] see John was still a human being right
[29:12] and though he was caught up in heaven he
[29:13] was still human
[29:15] he knew people were dying he knew he was
[29:18] on his Road
[29:19] out being close to 80 years old
[29:22] right that's why he was weeping
[29:25] everybody said well he didn't see his
[29:27] name or did see a week ago he wept
[29:29] because he was a human being knew that
[29:31] there was something had to happen
[29:33] different right
[29:35] not a different New Birth but something
[29:37] had to happen to that old man that was
[29:40] born of a man and a woman
[29:42] or they were going to continue to just
[29:45] keep dying and dying and dying but why
[29:48] John shouted he saw somebody physically
[29:51] taped that book
[29:54] and then John could look down through
[29:55] time I believe and he'd see a bride
[29:57] because remember he he typed us right
[30:00] The Whole World's groaning and waiting
[30:02] right waiting for the manifestation of
[30:04] the sons of God right that was what Paul
[30:07] wrote
[30:08] and I'm sure John read a lot of Paul's
[30:10] writings because when John left the Isle
[30:12] of Palms where'd he go he went to
[30:13] Ephesus and he pastored the church he
[30:15] pastored Paul's church after Paul was
[30:17] killed in 80 60 something
[30:19] um John comes back and pastors the
[30:22] church in Ephesus after Paul that week
[30:23] you don't think he sat there and read
[30:25] Paul's writings I believe he did sure
[30:27] and I believe the people that were there
[30:29] knew what Paul said because they were
[30:31] sitting there the same you know Ephesus
[30:33] was a mighty mighty group of people they
[30:35] were they were strong in faith but let's
[30:37] get back to this but so what brother
[30:39] Brown showed us
[30:41] was that John
[30:44] had to see something
[30:46] let me go back the bride
[30:49] John when I say John you think of the
[30:51] Bride right right from now on when I say
[30:53] John we've not gone we've not bride
[30:57] the land of the propaganda now he has
[31:00] prevailed
[31:03] but when the lamb took the book
[31:05] he's the one that sat down on the throne
[31:08] the reason he sat down on the throne
[31:11] it's because he overcome that's right
[31:13] Revelation 3
[31:15] 14-23 he said he that over cometh shall
[31:19] do what sit down with me in my Throne as
[31:23] I have
[31:25] let me let me interpolate took the book
[31:28] I sat down on my father's time
[31:31] because see he sat down through he was
[31:33] Son of God down through the church ages
[31:34] it wasn't son of man
[31:35] the Son of God Revelation remember the
[31:37] spirit of God
[31:38] flesh kept dying that's what happened
[31:40] John was looking he sees this right here
[31:42] now we know it's still happening today
[31:44] so John was looking way out in the
[31:46] prophetic
[31:48] come on brother random gets here we
[31:49] ain't got far enough yet
[31:52] so look at number 25.
[31:58] those things we just are presuming
[32:01] in other words if somebody doesn't take
[32:03] the book open the sales or just presume
[32:06] it because what he's going to tell us a
[32:08] little bit later he said we're going to
[32:09] come right back here to this scripture
[32:10] next Sunday night
[32:13] and
[32:15] next Sunday night was what when the
[32:18] seventh seal broke
[32:20] he's in here somewhere because I wrapped
[32:22] those things down
[32:24] but uh we'll find it next week this is
[32:26] kind of way on over
[32:28] but he reads the scripture and this is
[32:29] what he says in number
[32:31] in paragraph 29
[32:35] .
[32:35] excuse me this seven seal book is
[32:38] revealed at the time of the seven
[32:40] thunders of Revelations 10. now if
[32:42] you're marking it down let's turn to
[32:43] Revelations 10 just a moment so you'll
[32:45] get an understanding before we get into
[32:46] it
[32:48] all right so another Mighty Angel which
[32:50] is Christ come down from heaven clothed
[32:52] with a cloud of rainbow upon his head if
[32:53] you notice that's Christ see because he
[32:55] in the Old Testament was called the
[32:57] angel of the Covenant and he is directly
[32:59] coming to the Jews now for the church is
[33:01] finished all right now that throws
[33:02] people loot let me talk to you for about
[33:04] two minutes
[33:05] brother Brown says the church goes up in
[33:06] Revelations three not seen the
[33:08] Revelation 19 the bride
[33:10] that's physically true
[33:12] because we physically go on a Rapture at
[33:14] the timeline of Revelation 4.
[33:17] then he goes to the Jews correct so
[33:20] these seals are for the Jews
[33:23] right
[33:25] Revelation Revelation 6 through 19 or
[33:28] through 18 is for the Jews
[33:31] okay he's praying the Lord okay okay
[33:35] my cheerleader
[33:38] great job right now
[33:44] but uh
[33:46] that book
[33:48] had to be in her hand of the original
[33:50] owner before the seal could be broken
[33:51] right had to be in the hand of the
[33:54] region alone now brother Brandon wants
[33:55] him and you notice that's Christ because
[33:58] he in the Old Testament was called the
[33:59] angel Covenant and he's directly coming
[34:01] to the Jews now for the church is
[34:03] finished
[34:03] so everybody's like well brother Brown's
[34:05] got to come back this is where they get
[34:07] the return management
[34:08] brother Brian's got to come back because
[34:09] Revelations 10 everybody's gone
[34:12] but he's got to come back and reveal the
[34:15] Mysteries before
[34:17] he goes with the Jews but he's done
[34:19] doing that
[34:21] see as they listen as they miss Jesus's
[34:24] first coming
[34:27] so they're going to miss your second
[34:28] camp
[34:30] and his second coming his first coming
[34:32] was introduced by John the Baptist
[34:35] his second coming was introduced by
[34:37] Elijah or William Brown they missed them
[34:39] all remember they're going to miss them
[34:40] all right
[34:42] who is this John guy
[34:44] we thought he was the last or one of the
[34:46] prophets or something no he was one
[34:48] crying in the wilderness
[34:50] Jesus put him in the scripture
[34:52] brother Branham Malachi four that's why
[34:54] we go to Malachi four to see that God
[34:57] sent you Elijah the prophet
[34:59] all right so this is to the Jews
[35:01] physically this will happen when we
[35:04] leave here when I say this I mean the
[35:07] seal right but I hold this book up I'm
[35:09] in the seal all right and this book is
[35:12] totally physically open we will not be
[35:16] here
[35:17] but if we don't get the spiritual
[35:20] opening of these
[35:21] we will be here
[35:24] if you're not born again now if you're
[35:25] born again and you miss this that's okay
[35:27] that's all right you can come to a
[35:29] certain level and and
[35:30] dangle by the grain I'm talking about
[35:32] the people it's going to stand and there
[35:34] will be no death
[35:35] right none at all
[35:38] we were talking yesterday coming just
[35:40] for example yesterday
[35:42] um
[35:43] about um
[35:46] certain things when we see the Dead Come
[35:48] among us and we see the dead because
[35:50] remember the dead in Christ shall rise
[35:53] first they'll get their glorified body
[35:55] first so what comes what comes out of
[35:59] mind your mouth
[36:00] it's going to bring them out of that
[36:02] ground but we're still going to be in
[36:04] Mom and Daddy's old body
[36:06] when I say Mom and Daddy's the one that
[36:07] brought you here we're still going to be
[36:10] in a sinful
[36:11] condition of a flesh body that's going
[36:14] to hurt that's going to but once we see
[36:16] those dead Saints what more confidence
[36:19] how is death going to have a hold on you
[36:22] when you call somebody right and they're
[36:25] in a glorified body not somebody like
[36:27] Lazarus is going to die again or
[36:28] somebody that somebody drops dead and we
[36:30] pray for him it's just a cat and she
[36:31] comes back to life well you know what
[36:33] 40 years from now she's going to be dead
[36:37] when they when they come Among Us in
[36:39] that way and they're in their glorified
[36:42] body I promise you one thing if you can
[36:45] see them
[36:46] if you can see them
[36:48] and you're still alive
[36:50] you better believe one thing
[36:52] death has been destroyed that's right
[36:55] and you're part of it that's right and
[36:57] it won't be just a few days or whatever
[36:59] hours it doesn't matter but you'll be
[37:00] changed because Paul said we which are
[37:02] alive and remains shall be changed
[37:05] so brother Danny what comes out of our
[37:07] mouth
[37:08] has got to bring them out of the ground
[37:10] give them the glorified body and then
[37:12] change our body
[37:14] if you see it in that process there's
[37:16] nothing going to stop you that's right
[37:17] that's when that death will crawl up
[37:19] your sleeve and you'll just brush it off
[37:21] because if what you said brought that
[37:26] there's no way you can be stopped Satan
[37:29] can throw everything he can against you
[37:31] and there's no way to stop no way
[37:34] Lord
[37:37] from where I stopped with the breeze
[37:40] read about maybe four or five pages
[37:44] that way it'll keep it fresh and you
[37:46] must treat him up for my face last time
[37:48] I mean we'll cover and everything
