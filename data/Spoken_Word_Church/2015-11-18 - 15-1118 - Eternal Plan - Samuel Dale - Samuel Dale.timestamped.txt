[7:30] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who
[7:32] has blessed us with all spiritual
[7:33] blessings were in Heavenly places in
[7:36] Christ according as he had chosen Us in
[7:39] him when before the foundation of the
[7:42] world that we should be holy and Without
[7:45] Blame before him in love watch having
[7:49] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[7:52] children by Jesus Christ to himself what
[7:56] according to the good pleasure of his
[7:58] will
[8:00] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[8:02] wherein he hath made us accepted in the
[8:05] Beloved in whom we have Redemption
[8:07] through his blood the Forgiveness of
[8:10] sins according to the riches of his
[8:12] grace wherein Heath abounded toward us
[8:15] in all wisdom and Prudence having made
[8:18] known unto us what now the mystery of
[8:21] his will according to his good pleasure
[8:25] which he has purposed in
[8:27] himself his plan and purpose we'll get
[8:30] to it in a little while that in the
[8:32] dispensation of the fullness of times he
[8:34] might gather together and one all things
[8:37] in Christ both which are in heaven and
[8:39] which are on earth even in him in whom
[8:42] also we have obtained an inheritance
[8:45] being predestinated according to the
[8:47] purpose of him who worketh all things
[8:50] after the counsel of his own will notice
[8:53] all the way down his will his will his
[8:55] will his will his will all right that we
[8:58] should be to the Praise of his glory
[9:00] which first trusted in Christ in whom
[9:03] you also trusted after that you heard
[9:06] the word of Truth The Gospel of your
[9:09] salvation in whom also after you
[9:11] believed you were sealed with that Holy
[9:13] Spirit of Promise which is the earnest
[9:16] of our inheritance what until the
[9:19] Redemption of the purchased possession
[9:22] in other words bodily
[9:24] Redemption coming forth unto the praise
[9:27] of his glory now we'll go over to
[9:30] Philippians
[9:35] 2 verse five says let this mind be in
[9:39] you which was also in Christ Jesus now
[9:43] that's not his natural mind
[9:45] right all right who being in the form of
[9:49] God cuz see if he' had been his natural
[9:51] mind he couldn't have had that thought
[9:53] who being in the form of God thought it
[9:55] not robbery to be equal with God but
[9:58] made himself of no reputation and took
[10:00] upon him the form of a servant and was
[10:02] made in the likeness of men and being
[10:05] formed in the fashion as a man he
[10:07] humbled himself and became obedient unto
[10:10] death even the death of the Cross you
[10:13] may be seated the Lord add his Blessing
[10:16] to the reading of the word uh we've got
[10:20] one of the ones buzzing up here
[10:23] somewhere
[10:24] Josh so uh there you
[10:28] go
[10:30] I just wanted to get that out of the way
[10:32] cuz it does cause a little problem all
[10:35] right now we're trying to continue our
[10:37] thought from um the last messages when
[10:42] we were speaking on talking about the
[10:46] mind of
[10:48] God all right and uh I hope you're
[10:52] following me what I'm talking about on
[10:54] it
[10:56] because there is a point that we know
[10:59] for certainty that God fornew all things
[11:04] amen or else he wouldn't be God so all
[11:06] right and he knew everything that would
[11:09] ever be and ever would be and and all
[11:11] like that and just because that we have
[11:15] been thought of in the mind of God
[11:17] doesn't make us that's right to the
[11:19] right place cuz he thought of Judas he
[11:21] thought of Jacob have I loved and Esau
[11:23] have I hated uh you know he thought of
[11:27] that he knew that by his for
[11:29] knowledge of what's doing now we're
[11:32] going to uh drop down a little bit
[11:35] towards the Earthly form tonight and
[11:38] then pick up the Lord willing Sunday to
[11:41] continue on our thought but what is it
[11:44] we're talking about in in his mind not
[11:47] just something that he thought of
[11:50] because he thought of everybody right
[11:53] all right so then it doesn't make you
[11:56] Eternal just because he thought of you
[11:58] in his mind
[11:59] right all right it doesn't put it to
[12:03] where that we can say well if I was just
[12:06] in the mind of God that's all I want to
[12:08] be and well Judas his car was there too
[12:10] so now what are you talking
[12:13] about all right so then we're talking
[12:16] about the part of being in his mind as
[12:19] being part of the
[12:21] mind not just what God would be thinking
[12:24] of right you know right man but part of
[12:29] the very one that was doing the thinking
[12:32] we spent the whole Services all of these
[12:35] week after week and this is not number
[12:37] 13 trying to drive that part home about
[12:41] Genesis 1 126 and 27 the creation of man
[12:46] and that that man was part of God Amen
[12:50] not just a human element brought into
[12:53] existence that's Genesis uh 1:26 and 27
[12:58] which was
[13:00] not just in the mind of God but part of
[13:04] God all right CU he said let us make man
[13:07] in our own image and let them have
[13:09] dominion all right that's right and he
[13:12] called then later he called their name
[13:14] Adam amen all right which means the
[13:17] beginning and the doing all right so it
[13:20] wasn't just one person he was thinking
[13:22] of there of Adam and Eve because we've
[13:26] proved that part by trying to come
[13:28] through in the message and I hope you
[13:30] followed it that we don't think too much
[13:33] about Eve but Eve had to be in the
[13:36] original creation as much as Adam all
[13:39] right because she was a part of him and
[13:43] she was there even after Adam was placed
[13:45] in the Genesis 2 man you know the the
[13:49] flesh man that the one 26 and 27 was put
[13:53] over into that Eve was still in
[13:55] theophany right all right see then she
[13:57] had to come forth from there into human
[14:00] flesh you know like Adam and she came
[14:03] from Adam in literal human flesh and she
[14:07] came from God by the original
[14:09] impartation of Life all right
[14:14] now so then in thinking about
[14:18] it we we were talking about it like
[14:22] this that it's not God like
[14:25] 154 149 excuse me Church H book it's not
[14:29] like God God's not like a man with a
[14:33] blueprint that he draws up what he's
[14:35] going to do he doesn't have to do that
[14:39] all right I gave it to you in the
[14:41] message and we'll reread it after a
[14:43] while where brother Brandon said it was
[14:46] talking
[14:47] about the a
[14:49] vision of what he wanted in his mind you
[14:52] say well now and I thought about this
[14:54] the other day you say do you mean God
[14:56] has
[14:57] Visions well
[14:59] I will remind you that Jesus said
[15:04] what I do nothing until I see a vision
[15:11] you say oh you missed that word no
[15:13] that's that's what brother brandham
[15:16] said he said I do nothing unless there's
[15:19] a vision he had a vision to do he had a
[15:22] vision of of going on and then coming
[15:25] back and raising Lazarus there was a
[15:26] vision part to that well then is no
[15:29] problem to think about the vision of God
[15:32] all right now we know that our thoughts
[15:35] Isaiah 55 and 8 and N our thoughts are
[15:38] not like God's thoughts his thoughts are
[15:40] so much higher than our thoughts until
[15:43] our thoughts are not even in the picture
[15:46] all right then we got down to bringing
[15:48] one of the last quotes that we brought
[15:51] and brother Bram was talking about it so
[15:54] I put it back into the the message to
[15:57] use it tonight but uh that's a
[16:00] masterpiece where he's talking about the
[16:02] vision where he said the reality what
[16:05] was a vision in him was in his thinking
[16:08] and what was that talking he had in his
[16:10] mind what he wanted and he wanted to
[16:13] make man in his own image he wanted to
[16:16] make something in in reality of what was
[16:19] a vision to him and what was in his
[16:22] thinking all right then in doing that
[16:26] see we know for a certainty
[16:29] that it's not just God setting up
[16:32] thinking about
[16:33] something and it's not to just say in
[16:36] his
[16:36] mind because everybody's in his mind all
[16:40] right but being a part of the Mind
[16:44] itself like I've always told you I don't
[16:47] want to be just what God thinks of I
[16:49] want to be a part of the Thinker there's
[16:52] a whole lot of difference in that I want
[16:54] to be a part of the one that's doing
[16:56] that because that to me is the scripture
[16:59] we read in Philippians is that let this
[17:01] mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus
[17:04] and that's not his human
[17:06] brain that is eternal life or the
[17:09] baptism of the Holy Ghost bringing it
[17:11] down to you and I of being that part and
[17:14] then when it says that see because he
[17:17] had that
[17:19] mind you know right he thought it not
[17:23] robbery to be equal with
[17:26] God why because he was God so he had no
[17:31] problem of of any of his thoughts right
[17:33] so then that mind that's in you and I is
[17:36] the baptism with the Holy
[17:38] Ghost the new birth eternal life into
[17:41] our soul bringing us into that position
[17:44] all right now we want to pick up our
[17:47] thought tonight and try to take it on
[17:49] because we're talking about the thoughts
[17:51] of God
[17:53] remember the thoughts of God are Eternal
[17:57] MH
[17:59] all right now that doesn't I said make
[18:03] everything Eternal that he thought of
[18:05] but he can't change that
[18:08] thought once he said Jacob have I loved
[18:12] Esau have I hated no matter what Jacob
[18:16] done couldn't have turned him away and
[18:18] no matter what Esau tried to do would
[18:21] not change his mind amen why because
[18:24] he'd already thought it and remember we
[18:26] were given that that once he thinks it
[18:29] and speaks
[18:30] it there's no way I gave you a bunch of
[18:33] quotes the other day there there's no
[18:35] way that the devil in all of his demons
[18:39] can stop the plan of
[18:44] God right there's no way it can change
[18:46] it the devil can't do it right it don't
[18:49] matter what we think of this that or the
[18:51] other there's no way to for that Satan
[18:55] can change God's
[18:57] plan because because he's going to have
[18:59] it all right now that's what we want to
[19:01] deal that's the reason I put that
[19:02] message there of the positive thoughts
[19:05] of God in his mind as to not being like
[19:09] our thoughts that we could change them
[19:12] you know and do a situation and doing
[19:14] what he thought of in the beginning
[19:16] that's right was real and that's it you
[19:18] say well then brother Dale if he thought
[19:21] of me being lost will I be lost if he
[19:24] thought of you being lost you will be
[19:27] lost well then there's no need of me
[19:32] trying well you know what you just prove
[19:35] the point cuz if you're not willing to
[19:39] try he gave you a free moral
[19:44] agency so then who's making the point of
[19:47] us being lost right we are right am you
[19:53] know and it's it's like I tried to
[19:55] preach a message I remember years ago
[19:57] about something that I know what brother
[20:00] Brown says about Satan put us in the
[20:02] pawn shop I know the quotes Okay but I
[20:04] was trying to make a point out of it
[20:07] that you know really we put ourselves in
[20:09] the pawn
[20:11] shop when we reach the age of
[20:14] accountability that's right you said
[20:17] well the devil made me do it well I
[20:19] don't blame him for everything you may
[20:21] do it you may try to cough out you know
[20:24] and and blame it all on him and I don't
[20:26] do it I thought think you and I have the
[20:29] biggest portion of it I don't I think
[20:31] he's gone on vacation that he doesn't
[20:34] even have to fool with us because he's
[20:37] let us be so intellectually brained in
[20:40] our mind until he doesn't have to do
[20:43] anything
[20:44] anymore but we put our own selves in the
[20:47] pawn shop right because we made the
[20:52] choice to be lost amen so don't blame
[20:55] Adam and Eve for it and don't blame God
[20:58] all right now but what I want us to
[21:01] think
[21:02] on I want us to think about something
[21:05] that is very valuable to
[21:09] me in in thinking about the word of God
[21:12] and how great it is and how wonderful it
[21:14] is how perfect it is and the things of
[21:18] his word and how that he can't change
[21:21] it it's got to be true right but we just
[21:26] got to find it to make sure we got it
[21:28] lined up the way he says it cuz now we
[21:31] get our own
[21:33] ideas we say well the Bible says it yeah
[21:37] the Bible said Judas went and hung
[21:40] himself now I take another scripture and
[21:43] say you go do likewise now what are you
[21:45] going to
[21:48] do that's
[21:50] see it it's silly in our mind that we
[21:53] allow it to
[21:56] uh work work so
[21:59] much I guess is the best way to say it
[22:01] because you know we allow it to be done
[22:04] but I want you to think about now to
[22:06] keep your thought into the mind or
[22:08] thinking about in God's
[22:12] mind as being not
[22:15] just him sitting down thinking about
[22:18] it but it being his very thoughts we've
[22:22] been through message after message of
[22:24] the thoughts and the attributes of God
[22:28] and you know tying it together that
[22:31] those thoughts are his attributes and
[22:34] his attributes is part of him and he
[22:36] never gained any attributes coming down
[22:39] he always had those
[22:42] attributes all right see then we all we
[22:46] got to do is just line up that was kind
[22:48] of the last thought I put on my notes is
[22:51] we just got to find the plan and purpose
[22:54] that God has and then let's fall in line
[22:56] right right you know well we know what
[22:59] the plan and purpose
[23:01] is so let's just try to fall in line
[23:04] with it so let's let's pick up some
[23:05] thoughts and I want you to it may be
[23:07] surprising in a minute when we if we can
[23:10] get that far okay but bear with me go
[23:13] ahead and pull up number one uh brothers
[23:15] and let's just read what brother brownon
[23:17] said on the message called I know my
[23:19] redeemer liveth
[23:23] 1958 e13 look God's purpose can never be
[23:30] defeated there's nothing can defeat
[23:34] it so how happy ought we to be resting
[23:39] upon that beautiful revelation of the
[23:42] word of the Living God that there is
[23:44] neither things
[23:46] present nor things that can come there
[23:50] is no sickness no sorrow death no pearls
[23:53] no nothing can separate us from the
[23:55] purpose of the Living God that's right
[23:58] now you can't be
[24:02] done we we if there's anything way to do
[24:04] it we're going to be separating
[24:05] ourselves is the only way it can be done
[24:08] it's our our problems exactly is not
[24:12] just taking what he says now look what
[24:14] he said what God has imagined in his
[24:18] mind what God has purposed in his
[24:21] heart to bring to P there's no demon
[24:25] there's no power there's nothing can
[24:27] ever separate God's Great Immortal and
[24:31] watching me eternal plan it must be as
[24:35] God has said now that's the thought for
[24:38] tonight the thought for tonight is the
[24:41] Eternal
[24:43] plan yes but brother Dale the way you're
[24:46] sounding you're bringing it out and and
[24:49] coming down hard and strong about
[24:52] predestination and you're making it like
[24:55] that nobody's got a choice we haven't
[24:58] even got to Earth yet where we can make
[25:00] one that's
[25:01] right I'm still up in heaven amen I was
[25:06] listening the other day to brother brand
[25:07] and he was bringing he was and he was
[25:09] bringing about about the old black man
[25:11] you know the first one he ran into and
[25:14] said he started off on the up in heaven
[25:16] and said brought him down the horizontal
[25:18] rainbow and he said where were you when
[25:21] the morning Stars sang together and the
[25:22] sons of God shouted for
[25:25] Joy you know what brother Ram in enjoyed
[25:28] that he refers to that a lot that's
[25:31] right why because the man had something
[25:34] that's right all right so let's think
[25:37] about it think about an eternal
[25:42] plan
[25:44] now the best way we can talk about an
[25:48] eternal plan it just means it's Eternal
[25:50] and that's
[25:51] it it it's not something can be added to
[25:55] if it's Eternal all right so he had an
[25:58] eternal
[26:00] plan well then if he had an eternal plan
[26:03] I just don't I don't know I just I don't
[26:05] know whether I'm to be saved or not well
[26:07] you're the one making the choice right
[26:10] that's right it's not God
[26:15] am he gives us the choice amen so you
[26:20] got to make your own choice of your own
[26:23] thinking all right now an eternal plan
[26:29] that can something Eternal cannot be
[26:31] added to or taken from right so if he
[26:35] had an eternal
[26:38] plan see then it's going to come
[26:40] forth
[26:42] amen yeah but you're leaning too much on
[26:45] that old predestination Doctrine
[26:49] well we ain't got down to the four
[26:52] knowledges and talking yet so just bear
[26:55] with me you know and and think about
[26:57] about the things that we're talking
[26:59] about have I brought any Doctrine yet
[27:03] that seems to be uh anti message or
[27:06] antis
[27:08] scriptural if it is come and tell me
[27:10] about
[27:11] it because all I've been doing is
[27:14] dealing with the fact of what was in God
[27:16] before the foundation of the world
[27:19] Amen that he had all of those attributes
[27:22] within him right when he was
[27:25] self-existing that's right
[27:28] amen right see then he was already a
[27:31] father he was already a Healer he was
[27:33] already a savior no he couldn't be a
[27:35] savior cuz it was nothing
[27:38] lost you're making him become a savior
[27:43] right you're making it like well
[27:45] something happened I got to change the
[27:49] course you're not talking about the God
[27:51] I'm talking about that's
[27:54] right that could never change his mind
[27:56] about his word
[27:58] amen you're changing his mind well well
[28:01] it could no but I got now i' got to do
[28:03] something you know yeah that's the way
[28:05] we think but it won't work am right why
[28:08] don't you get in your mind sometimes of
[28:10] about a great Eternal God and think
[28:13] about how great he
[28:19] is all right see then let's talk about
[28:22] is that we read in Paul here that he
[28:25] speaks
[28:26] of a
[28:29] mystery and he said there was a mystery
[28:32] there that we read there in
[28:34] Ephesians all right now mystery is
[28:38] something that has not been made known
[28:41] right all right and even after it's made
[28:45] known because you Time Mystery to the
[28:47] word revelation the same
[28:49] thing that it's even though it's made
[28:53] known a supernatural element will remain
[28:56] despite the mystery
[28:58] the fact spite the fact that it's
[29:00] revealed to you there'll be things that
[29:02] are left don't worry about
[29:05] it I thought we believ the prophet said
[29:09] that we'd even get a message of cheer
[29:11] down to the endless ages after this
[29:13] world was over with do you think our
[29:16] little peanut brain understanding of
[29:18] what we have now is all there is of
[29:22] god this is just enough to get us
[29:25] started right MH we wouldn't be able
[29:28] it's just like it is with what no man
[29:30] can call Jesus the Christ what except it
[29:33] be by the baptism of the Holy
[29:35] Ghost all right right and see are we
[29:38] trying to limit him that way or what are
[29:41] we but let's think about
[29:43] it that this great Eternal
[29:51] God he wanted
[29:54] to let himself be expressed
[29:58] right now let's read that and just pick
[30:01] up a few little thoughts go ahead to
[30:02] number two which is Christ is a Myst of
[30:04] God
[30:05] reveal and watch what he
[30:09] says now
[30:11] God's secret
[30:14] mystery he had before the world
[30:17] began now back in the back part of God's
[30:21] mind now that's beyond anything we can
[30:23] comprehend right right so it would take
[30:26] a prophet to have to go back into the
[30:28] mind of God and bring it out right okay
[30:33] now back in the back part of God's mind
[30:35] there was something that he was trying
[30:37] and was going to
[30:39] achieve what now he was trying that's
[30:43] looks like well he he didn't but said
[30:45] and was going to
[30:47] achieve that's not a choice then and he
[30:51] had a motive in doing
[30:53] it in order to let himself be expressed
[31:00] because first there wasn't even a Moon
[31:02] Star atom molecule or anything he was
[31:04] God but he actually wasn't God at the
[31:07] time because God is an object of worship
[31:09] that's just our wording and there wasn't
[31:10] nothing to worship him so what did he do
[31:12] he made angels and they worshiped him
[31:14] all right now so think about
[31:19] it so in his great mind he wanted these
[31:24] attributes to be
[31:26] expressed
[31:27] now what did he say back up above there
[31:30] in order to let himself be
[31:35] expressed
[31:38] now look at all the
[31:41] attributes that God has and look at
[31:44] we'll just take a few right
[31:46] here and in him was love that would be
[31:50] one to cover the whole vast coverage of
[31:53] all things
[31:55] right in him him was to be
[31:59] father in him was to be
[32:03] son in him was to be a savior and him
[32:07] was to be a Healer and all these great
[32:10] attributes that we see already
[32:12] expressed they were in him they were in
[32:16] God all right
[32:21] now whatever attribute you could think
[32:23] of place it within that paragraph
[32:28] and your
[32:30] thinking that whatever you would think
[32:32] about him as to
[32:34] be
[32:36] remember he had a motive in order a
[32:40] motive in doing it in order to let
[32:43] himself be
[32:46] expressed now so whatever you want to
[32:49] put there father healer son uh savior
[32:52] whatever these attributes
[32:55] were we see already ready expressed they
[32:58] were in God to begin with all right now
[33:04] those attributes being in
[33:07] him now as I said the reason I'm putting
[33:10] that because when we get on over just in
[33:13] a few minutes the Lord willing we're
[33:15] going to pick up something that will
[33:18] seemingly shock the point but I want you
[33:23] to think about it that no matter what
[33:26] after you can think
[33:28] of put it in the Eternal God as already
[33:33] being
[33:34] there but not made manifest right amen
[33:39] right y amen see just not being made
[33:44] manifest all right
[33:48] now go on down to where we got what we
[33:50] got number five
[33:52] 105 now God had a
[33:55] purpose and a hidden
[33:58] mystery I love that now you know what
[34:01] goes on down below here and I'm not
[34:02] going to try to express anything just
[34:04] plainly say you know what goes on down
[34:06] below there where brother Brown talks
[34:08] about under our seventh mystery and the
[34:10] reason I love that is because when you
[34:12] do read over there in Revelation 10 and
[34:15] it comes down to verse 7 I believe it is
[34:17] what does it say in the days of the
[34:19] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[34:22] begin to sound the
[34:25] mystery it does not say Mysteries
[34:29] right come on it says mystery right
[34:33] because there is one
[34:36] mystery that will tie up every mystery
[34:39] together into a
[34:43] bundle right Yen amen that's the great
[34:46] mystery that we're talking about all
[34:49] right now
[34:52] what now God had a purpose in a hidden
[34:54] Mystery and that's what I won't speak on
[34:56] the churches morning the hidden Mystery
[34:58] that God that he had in his mind before
[35:00] the world ever began and how that watch
[35:02] I love this one and how that it's
[35:04] unfolded itself right down to this
[35:08] present hour that we're
[35:11] living how
[35:14] wonderful a man could
[35:18] speak under the anointing of the Holy
[35:21] Spirit he didn't say we see how it's
[35:23] unfolded it all the way down to the
[35:26] millennium the future home the
[35:30] things that's why I enjoyed brother Joe
[35:32] Green last amen
[35:35] Wednesday when he was speaking
[35:39] about you
[35:41] know positive attitude
[35:44] faith I love people with positive
[35:47] attitude amen I hate somebody that well
[35:50] I don't know I'll try to do that you
[35:53] [Music]
[35:55] know everybody want wonders well how in
[35:57] the world brother Dale did you ever
[35:58] learn to do all kind of carpenter work
[36:01] wiring and plumbing and stuff like that
[36:03] when you never went to in school you
[36:05] know how I learned I learned because
[36:07] that the fact I used to pay people to do
[36:09] it and they goofed up so much till I
[36:11] just decided I'd start trying to do it
[36:12] myself and you know what I wound up to
[36:15] doing a pretty decent job of it even
[36:17] bragging on my own s but it'll work
[36:20] Richard thought I was going to burn his
[36:22] house down one time because I was trying
[36:23] to back feed some power into his house
[36:27] he was screaming I was going to burn his
[36:28] house down I said just calm down you
[36:31] know I know what I'm doing but
[36:35] listen down to this present
[36:38] hour there is no
[36:41] tomorrow you enjoy that with brother Joe
[36:44] there is no tomorrow when we get darus
[36:47] today No Tomorrow there's no yesterday
[36:50] it's done
[36:52] past let's live in a present tense time
[36:55] am let's live where the Bible said he
[36:58] that believeth that God
[37:00] is present
[37:02] tense all right see it's unfolded down
[37:05] to where we are right now
[37:08] amen all right where we're living right
[37:11] now
[37:12] right it's unfolded down to that part if
[37:14] you're listening to what he's saying and
[37:16] he saids we'll understand clearly on I
[37:18] believe what is being
[37:20] done all right
[37:22] listen God had a plan had a purpose and
[37:26] a hidden
[37:27] history it was eternal because we read
[37:29] that from I know my redeemer
[37:32] liveth and what a wonderful thing it
[37:35] would turn out to
[37:37] be and to see it if we would look at it
[37:40] correctly cuz what does the Bible
[37:43] say the Bible says the people without a
[37:46] what
[37:48] Vision what happens
[37:53] perish people without a vision perish
[37:57] now if you can't follow
[37:59] that uh go on your website and look up
[38:02] these guys that's turning against
[38:03] brother brandham and calling him wrong
[38:05] and doing all the thing if you can't
[38:07] read that with common sense and to see
[38:10] that they've lost their Vision they had
[38:12] a vision to begin with they had their
[38:14] thoughts and they were running good and
[38:16] great Brothers but now they have no
[38:18] vision so they
[38:20] perish
[38:22] Y without a vision what is your vision
[38:29] now I don't mean openly to see it unfold
[38:33] and
[38:35] no what is your vision what is your
[38:41] thoughts why are we here 50 years since
[38:45] the prophet
[38:46] left
[38:49] right and people thinking then they
[38:51] wouldn't go make it till the next
[38:53] week and they done some outlandish
[38:55] things to showing they didn't believe it
[38:59] right and then we laugh at Jim Jones and
[39:02] the situations that took place in
[39:04] life but listen what about it let's read
[39:07] that one where he talks of Masterpiece
[39:09] go ahead with number three where he
[39:10] talks about
[39:13] this and he's talking about said now
[39:15] let's turn the page of Michelangelo and
[39:17] close the book and let's open another
[39:20] book and read of the great sculpture of
[39:22] the almighty who before there was a
[39:25] world and before before the foundations
[39:27] was laid now watch it where's he
[39:31] at before there was a world and before
[39:33] the foundations was laid he had in his
[39:37] mind what he
[39:42] wanted he just didn't have a
[39:46] thought he had in his mind what he
[39:48] wanted look what he
[39:50] wanted and he wanted to make man in his
[39:53] own
[39:54] image watch he wanted
[39:58] to make something in
[40:01] reality of what was a vision to him what
[40:05] was in his
[40:09] thinking you see he wanted to make man
[40:12] when did he make man when is he talking
[40:13] about making that
[40:15] man when did he make the Genesis 1: 126
[40:18] and 27
[40:19] man he created the Flesh of the the
[40:22] human element that we call Adam on the
[40:25] sixth day right
[40:28] right and even in the writing out of the
[40:32] scriptures you got six days of creation
[40:35] and then you drop to when you do you hit
[40:37] to 126 and
[40:42] 27 and that's in the rest of God right
[40:46] and that goes back that when did he
[40:47] create this spiritual
[40:49] man before the foundation of the world
[40:52] right not as a
[40:55] creation but as an
[40:57] impartation of his own
[41:00] life are you following me see then you
[41:03] can't accuse me of saying well you're
[41:04] you're taking sides of this you're doing
[41:06] this that on predestin we ain't even got
[41:07] down to the Earth
[41:09] yet we're we're still like the old black
[41:12] man we're running around up in heaven
[41:14] we're coming down the horizontal
[41:16] rainbow I've been enjoying it I don't
[41:18] know where you have or
[41:19] not you some of you think it's just
[41:22] dried up and dead and all like that but
[41:23] that's that's your business I'm just
[41:26] having me a good
[41:28] time because I think about the word of
[41:31] God now what about this man we've given
[41:35] these but what about this
[41:38] man and look what brother randam calls
[41:42] him go ahead with number
[41:44] four and you'll see all these Mark out
[41:47] if you could see my notes and and you'll
[41:49] see Joe and him having to jump backwards
[41:51] and
[41:52] forwards because I try my best to cut
[41:54] down as much as I can to keep from it
[41:56] being boring and giving you too many
[41:59] quotes cuz if you're not going to
[42:00] believe one quote with the fact of
[42:02] knowing that brother Dale's laying got
[42:04] it laid on his desk if you want some
[42:05] more I got plenty of them laying there
[42:08] if you're not going to believe it that
[42:09] well that's just one place he said that
[42:12] well you're the one that's slowing this
[42:14] whole thing
[42:16] down
[42:17] right you're the one that's slowing it
[42:20] down not me I'm W to just give you the
[42:23] quote and say there's where the Prophet
[42:24] said it let's move amen
[42:26] you know let's go look what he says
[42:29] questions and answers in
[42:32] 1953 he's asked a question now let us
[42:34] who Father and Son make man in our own
[42:36] image now if a man was made something
[42:38] like that little
[42:40] sacred light Yonder or something like
[42:43] that it could not be seen which is a
[42:47] spiritual being he manifested or
[42:50] unfolded himself a little more in more
[42:54] to make a trenity of himself by father
[42:57] Son and Holy Spirit and here was God
[43:00] unfolding himself now down
[43:03] into let us make man which was his
[43:09] son an
[43:11] offspring from
[43:16] him he desired to make a
[43:19] man
[43:21] right but how did he desire to make the
[43:23] man just make the man we just have a man
[43:25] we make a man we just
[43:27] do the man was to be an offspring right
[43:33] M all
[43:35] right man in her own image he was a
[43:37] supernatural
[43:39] being and let him have dominion know the
[43:41] cattles of the fielding and so forth
[43:44] that's now a supernatural
[43:50] being what he wanted to do to bring the
[43:54] vision forth
[43:57] and the vision and what was his plan and
[44:00] purpose what was he trying to
[44:04] achieve we look at it as being uh healer
[44:10] savior Redeemer uh things like that we
[44:13] we don't like that sun that brother
[44:16] Brandon puts in there you know we we we
[44:19] get a little messed up in there when
[44:21] when brother randam like he said there
[44:22] would make a man make father make a son
[44:26] something like the beginning that he was
[44:30] something like the theophany man that he
[44:33] was a supernatural
[44:36] being we don't like to deal with the sun
[44:38] because that throws us to a point of
[44:40] having to
[44:42] think how could it be a
[44:45] son well I want to ask you a
[44:48] question how can it be that that being
[44:52] that was brought into existence of 126
[44:55] and 27
[44:56] could be anything other than a
[44:58] son that's
[45:02] right may I ask you that question how
[45:04] could it be anything other than a son
[45:06] yes but sons has beginnings and sons has
[45:09] and they'll have endings
[45:14] and we don't believe in Eternal
[45:18] sunship but we believe in Eternal
[45:21] godship may I quote you that one that's
[45:23] a direct quote from the prophet we don't
[45:26] believe in Eternal sunship but we
[45:27] believe in Eternal godship who was the
[45:30] son that created all
[45:32] things according to Colossians 1 Hebrews
[45:35] 1 John 1 Ephesians I believe it's right
[45:38] 3 and N Jesus Christ created all
[45:42] things and there was not anything made
[45:44] that was made that he didn't make is
[45:47] that summing up all of that and you know
[45:49] what he was called a Son of
[45:53] God but he wasn't a son like a second
[45:57] person
[45:59] right he was God made
[46:03] manifest in another
[46:06] form when the logos it came out from
[46:10] God as the prophet would call it the Son
[46:13] of God what did he say it was he said
[46:16] it's just God in another form that's
[46:17] right
[46:19] right it's just God in another
[46:22] form but he's an
[46:24] offspring from
[46:27] God an
[46:30] offspring go ahead to number
[46:33] five the identified Masterpiece of
[46:38] God heern our thoughts from Michelangelo
[46:42] God Almighty who in the beginning before
[46:43] there was a day or a dawn or of a day
[46:46] before there was an atom or a molecule
[46:49] God in his mind had
[46:51] man what a man should look
[46:54] like
[46:58] I know you don't like for me to stop
[47:00] because when I stop it's always
[47:01] something to try to help you but it
[47:03] generally hinders you so if man was made
[47:06] a man what was
[47:14] God I leave that for you to think about
[47:18] if God was M if man was made in the
[47:19] image of God even if he just made to
[47:22] look like him y right what is
[47:28] God yeah but but God is not real until
[47:31] he come in
[47:34] flesh
[47:38] sorry I thought Moses saw him right and
[47:42] saw the back part of a
[47:44] man I thought in Hebrews about seven
[47:47] it's is it 74 where it's talking about
[47:51] mzd and it says the man right right
[47:55] right the man
[47:59] in but see is your god real that's my
[48:02] problem with people is trying to get
[48:03] them to see how real God is that's right
[48:06] all right but look God in it had God in
[48:09] his mind had man what a man should look
[48:12] like what he should be and what he
[48:14] should act like and he wanted that man
[48:17] what to be part of
[48:21] him so he made man in his own image in
[48:26] the likeness of God created he
[48:28] man oh when God in the beginning made
[48:32] this
[48:33] masterpiece something that reflected his
[48:37] thoughts it's all
[48:40] right this man was an offspring of
[48:44] God this man was part of
[48:49] God this man he had back
[48:51] there go ahead to
[48:54] number six
[48:56] questions and answers on
[49:00] Hebrews what do we do well my deared
[49:03] brother my dear sainted sister before
[49:05] the foundation of the world when God
[49:07] created You In His Image or created The
[49:10] Man In His Image and created the woman
[49:13] in the image of the man for the glory of
[49:15] the man he made you at theophany just
[49:18] like himself when he said let us to the
[49:21] creatures that he had made let us make
[49:23] man in our own image and our likeness a
[49:26] theophany God had never become flesh yet
[49:29] he was in a theophany so now what did he
[49:32] make a theophany
[49:35] man
[49:39] right did he ever mention
[49:43] that while he was here go ahead to
[49:46] number
[49:51] seven Divine Healing
[49:54] 1954 Jesus told his disciples I knew you
[49:58] before the foundation of the world
[50:00] before the world began he knew it all
[50:03] things was made and ordained there we're
[50:06] just working according to the scales the
[50:09] schedule
[50:11] rather Jeremiah Jeremiah 1:4 I believe
[50:14] it is or 4:1 I forgot now I think it's
[50:16] 1:4 God told Jeremiah said before you
[50:19] was even formed in your mother's wound I
[50:22] knew you and Sanctified you and ordained
[50:24] you a prophet to the Nations is that
[50:27] right how did he have anything to do
[50:30] with it it isn't you're born that
[50:34] way now you agreed with me a few weeks
[50:39] ago when I mentioned a few things that I
[50:42] would get to on
[50:43] speaking about how the
[50:46] prophets were
[50:51] predestinated not just in God's
[50:54] mind
[50:56] the prophets were
[50:58] predestinated
[51:00] amen well now if the prophets were
[51:04] predestinated just
[51:06] remember those prophets in the Old
[51:09] Testament were not in the body of
[51:12] Christ and if they were predestinated
[51:15] from God eternally to bring the word of
[51:17] the age what about a people to live that
[51:21] word is it that's right okay
[51:28] go ahead with the next one number
[51:31] eight don't question and answerers on
[51:33] Hebrews but it's a different
[51:37] 8:48 now there you are that's the way we
[51:39] are here we come from a higher
[51:43] being in the beginning we were in the
[51:46] image of God the veil in the darkness
[51:48] keeps us from knowing it now knowing it
[51:50] now but Jesus told his disciples he was
[51:53] with them before the foundation of the
[51:55] world
[51:55] see we were we can't know it now but you
[51:59] was in the beginning and if this Earthly
[52:02] Tabernacle be dissolved we have one
[52:04] already waiting Hallelujah and then we
[52:07] move into that this theophany that we
[52:09] once
[52:10] lived so we can eat and shake hands and
[52:15] the souls under the altar crying how
[52:17] long now if you're reading what he just
[52:20] said you move into this theophany what
[52:23] we were once live all right remember
[52:28] we're still talking about eternal
[52:33] life all
[52:37] right who is this male chesd he
[52:42] said not your being
[52:44] here so we're not dealing with any
[52:46] fleshly things we haven't even come into
[52:48] the natural creation yet that will begin
[52:52] in the Sunday service is one of the two
[52:55] we will talk about the natural creation
[52:57] of
[52:58] mankind and bring it into this that we
[53:01] can
[53:02] see but we're staying here as a plan and
[53:05] a purpose of God that he had before the
[53:08] world that he was going to have amen
[53:12] Offspring now if he was a
[53:17] father you remember I clipped that a
[53:19] little bit a couple about four weeks
[53:23] ago there was talking about that before
[53:25] the world ever begun he was already God
[53:28] because the Angels worshiped him and
[53:30] that made him
[53:32] God in
[53:35] manifestation I clipped it a little bit
[53:37] and didn't say much about it because I
[53:38] love to do that and then one day just
[53:41] lay it on you and let you think about it
[53:43] hoping that you'll remember
[53:45] it now we read many times that he was a
[53:52] father well he didn't have to wait until
[53:55] mankind come into the world to be a
[54:00] father the Genesis 1 126 and 27 man made
[54:05] him the
[54:06] father before the foundation of the
[54:08] world
[54:10] Amen are you with me that's right he
[54:13] didn't have to wait until he created
[54:15] something natural in flesh that's right
[54:18] because the natural in flesh is not the
[54:20] exact image of God is
[54:23] it may look like and be that but it's
[54:25] not that what's the exact image of God
[54:27] and
[54:28] likeness a supernatural
[54:32] being the
[54:34] word
[54:36] right and see before the foundation of
[54:38] the world
[54:40] then if we wouldn't back there if our
[54:42] names may I quote it where you'll at
[54:44] least agree with this the prophet said
[54:47] if our names were not written in the L's
[54:49] book of life before the foundation of
[54:50] the world it'll never be written there
[54:52] you agree with what he
[54:53] said well if you agree what he said then
[54:55] there's got to be one thing about it
[54:57] there had to be a
[54:59] record
[55:01] right there had to be something took
[55:03] place back
[55:06] there and see when he brought this
[55:10] Offspring this 126 and 27 man into being
[55:13] that made him father right he doesn't
[55:16] have to do anything else that made him
[55:19] father in
[55:21] manifestation because that's the image
[55:24] he wants
[55:26] it don't matter about this a big fat
[55:28] ugly pretty round skinny this ain't what
[55:32] he's talking
[55:33] about
[55:35] amen this is not the image and likeness
[55:38] of almighty God
[55:41] Amen yet I do
[55:43] believe that he was a man amen
[55:47] absolutely yes all right amen but if you
[55:51] get in the point what I'm talking about
[55:53] the 126 and 27 man was was made in exact
[55:55] image because it's exactly him made
[55:57] manifest in another form now if you
[56:00] agreed while ago that the father that
[56:04] brother brile emphasize it where he said
[56:07] he said there he was he said the father
[56:09] was sitting there just paraphrasing it
[56:11] he said then out from him goes the logos
[56:13] the speech go back to questions and
[56:16] answers on Genesis and
[56:19] listen and he said out from that went
[56:21] the logos the speech the Son of God yep
[56:25] that's right he said now that was not
[56:27] another
[56:28] person that was God in another form
[56:32] right yes called a son right well why
[56:36] can't you believe then the eternal life
[56:38] that you have within you
[56:40] today
[56:43] right we're
[56:46] not I thought if we believe that we were
[56:49] HS of God and join HS with
[56:53] Christ
[56:55] and I thought that if he said over there
[56:57] where we read in Philippians that he
[57:00] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[57:02] God now here's where you're going to
[57:05] jump and forget why can't we believe
[57:07] that by the baptism of the Holy Ghost in
[57:10] our soul the eternal life we have is
[57:14] equal with God because it is God right
[57:18] amen is it another person no
[57:23] no it's God made manifest in another
[57:26] form that's right amen
[57:29] sir you see the that's why the Oneness
[57:32] people they say that Jesus was the life
[57:35] form of God if you take a Oneness he's
[57:38] like your finger brother BR I'm going
[57:39] say he's one like your finger if you
[57:41] really talk to them and I have they'll
[57:43] tell you that Jesus was the life form of
[57:46] God I differ with them totally amen
[57:50] right I believe I'm looking at the Bride
[57:52] of Jesus Christ amen
[57:56] and by looking at the Bride of Jesus
[57:57] Christ I'm seeing God in another form
[57:59] the life form for the Gentile
[58:01] dispensation is the Bride of Jesus
[58:03] Christ I said Gentile dispensation then
[58:05] he goes to the Jews through two
[58:07] witnesses and they do and they become
[58:09] the life form but we are the last form I
[58:13] thought that we believe that the Bride
[58:16] of Jesus
[58:19] Christ were the children of God Amen I
[58:24] thought even the in the book of Acts
[58:25] understood that when he says Paul he
[58:29] says and we are his offspring y
[58:36] amen come
[58:40] on I thought the bride would be the
[58:44] what the final voice to the final age
[58:49] quoting the rest of it under her
[58:51] messenger that's right amen without her
[58:54] Messengers we bride forget it junk
[58:56] garbage run on that's why that folks
[58:59] I've got to put everything I got into
[59:01] this message absolutely I can't do like
[59:03] these other guys is do and and got
[59:05] something left over that they can just
[59:07] run off to it you know that's right
[59:09] where they corrected this and they've
[59:11] corrected that and they're wrong here
[59:12] and so and so is one that corrected so
[59:14] we need to follow so and
[59:15] so yeah I thought she was the final
[59:19] voice to the final age under her
[59:21] messenger which means she is to bring
[59:23] only the word he problem right amen
[59:26] that's right all right so that's the
[59:28] final voice is the word of God through
[59:30] the prophet's message delivered to the
[59:32] Saints
[59:33] right all
[59:35] right now I don't ask you to raise a
[59:37] hand to agree with me I just ask you to
[59:40] consider the thoughts for tonight cuz
[59:43] that was what I was aiming at the other
[59:45] day to consider the thoughts
[59:50] that the man that God wanted before the
[59:54] found foundation of the
[59:55] world would be his offspring
[59:59] right not just a human being a
[1:00:05] people he was made a father when the 126
[1:00:10] man 27 man come into being in him as
[1:00:14] what he brought
[1:00:17] forth he become a
[1:00:22] father right
[1:00:28] he didn't have to wait until he created
[1:00:29] us in flesh to be father that's right
[1:00:33] no he was already a father
[1:00:37] am now when you deal with healer savior
[1:00:40] you got to wait until the fall comes how
[1:00:43] many remembers that message about five
[1:00:45] or six weeks ago that I tried my best to
[1:00:48] explain that I said they these things
[1:00:49] here will take place they were taking
[1:00:51] place in heaven they don't have to have
[1:00:53] no earthly being to make these manifest
[1:00:55] that he was God cu the Angels worshiped
[1:00:57] him he was father because he brought his
[1:00:59] being his children his offspring that's
[1:01:02] right amen right into
[1:01:05] being we'll call her by another
[1:01:11] name let's call her by another name when
[1:01:14] we get a couple of
[1:01:15] quotes let's call that man or that being
[1:01:19] go ahead one number
[1:01:22] eight oh excuse me that's the one we
[1:01:24] just read go ahead with number nine we
[1:01:27] just read number
[1:01:29] eight cuz we're changing courses now
[1:01:32] just for a little
[1:01:36] bit so I would
[1:01:38] listen very
[1:01:43] closely because we're going to bring out
[1:01:45] something that maybe you had not
[1:01:48] considered to fit within this
[1:01:51] category of where we're at
[1:01:56] we were in Christ The Mystery of God
[1:01:58] revealed a while ago when we were trying
[1:02:00] to bring out that he had a plan and a
[1:02:02] purpose and
[1:02:03] Etc that he was going to see it achieved
[1:02:06] he was going to have these things we
[1:02:09] went through that there's no way to
[1:02:10] change the fact that he's going to do
[1:02:15] this now look what he
[1:02:19] says this is paragraph
[1:02:21] 107 he has showed or revealed thas about
[1:02:24] the mystery the plan the purpose the
[1:02:27] goal that he
[1:02:29] had he has showed or revealed it in
[1:02:31] every TP that's in the
[1:02:33] Bible the mystery y the
[1:02:38] mystery he showed her revealed in every
[1:02:41] type that's in the
[1:02:44] Bible watch him therefore the entire
[1:02:47] Bible is a revelation of God's mystery
[1:02:51] in
[1:02:52] Christ h
[1:02:54] the entire Bible is an expression of one
[1:02:57] goal that God
[1:02:59] had one purpose he wanted to achieve in
[1:03:03] the entire
[1:03:05] Bible and all the acts of the of the
[1:03:08] Believers in the Bible has been in top
[1:03:12] and expressing what God's Great goal is
[1:03:16] and now in this last day he has revealed
[1:03:20] it and shows it but God's help he said
[1:03:23] we'll see it right here this morning
[1:03:25] what the Lord has had in his mind all
[1:03:29] along and has expressed it y right now
[1:03:35] are you with
[1:03:37] me now he's picking up the Believers in
[1:03:40] the
[1:03:44] Bible
[1:03:47] right and would not the Believers in the
[1:03:50] Bible be his
[1:03:53] offspring
[1:04:03] is that right that's right the Believers
[1:04:06] in the
[1:04:08] Bible take the names of the the
[1:04:10] Believers out and what have you got
[1:04:16] nothing they had to be a Paul they had
[1:04:19] to be a Peter they had to be a James
[1:04:20] they had to be a John they had to be a
[1:04:22] Moses they had to be a phoh I mean uh it
[1:04:25] had to be Pharaoh for the other
[1:04:29] side but what about it
[1:04:33] now do we believe that before the
[1:04:35] foundation of the world that he had all
[1:04:38] of this in that being that he was and
[1:04:41] that his offspring was already there
[1:04:43] with
[1:04:49] him may I quote the
[1:04:53] scripture
[1:04:54] where were you when I laid the
[1:04:55] foundation of the world the morning
[1:04:58] Stars sang together and the sons of God
[1:05:00] shouted for Joy
[1:05:02] amen I thought brother brandham
[1:05:05] explained that as being when they saw
[1:05:10] the Plan of
[1:05:12] Redemption or the Plan of Salvation
[1:05:15] coming into view was the reason they
[1:05:17] were
[1:05:18] shouting before the
[1:05:23] world
[1:05:24] so you know what there just no way for
[1:05:27] us to remember
[1:05:30] it but those with eternal life today now
[1:05:33] come on get me in the right place those
[1:05:35] with eternal life today not everybody in
[1:05:36] the world those with eternal life in
[1:05:38] their soul today that eternal life was
[1:05:41] before the foundation of the world
[1:05:42] that's right now if not then you're the
[1:05:44] one that's messed up that's right
[1:05:49] amen when the morning Stars sang
[1:05:51] together and the sons of God shouted for
[1:05:52] Joy when they seen the Plan of
[1:05:57] Redemption yeah but that's too close to
[1:05:59] Mormon
[1:06:01] Doctrine I know the doctrine so don't
[1:06:04] worry about it I know what they believe
[1:06:06] they believe that we was all up in
[1:06:08] heaven and we all decided we wanted to
[1:06:10] come to Earth where we could make our
[1:06:12] father be a great father and and a
[1:06:14] Healer and a savior and things and
[1:06:20] all but if it wouldn't but for one thing
[1:06:24] to show you where they're wrong
[1:06:26] at and I'm not picking on Doctrine
[1:06:28] that's none of my
[1:06:30] business but you know in their Doctrine
[1:06:32] they believe that the
[1:06:34] devil had the plan to save everybody I
[1:06:37] talked with a man that knew what he's
[1:06:39] talking
[1:06:40] about that the devil had a plan to save
[1:06:44] everybody and Jesus had a plan to just
[1:06:47] save so many and father took Jesus's
[1:06:50] plan over the devil's plan that would be
[1:06:54] enough to reject any thoughts of
[1:06:57] Mormonism and their thoughts I'm not go
[1:07:02] find somebody and talk to
[1:07:04] him I spent eight hours on the line with
[1:07:06] a man one day I knew him he knew me he
[1:07:10] knew about me and this mind I knew him
[1:07:12] he said what are we going to talk about
[1:07:13] I said explain the Mormon Doctrine to
[1:07:16] me I said we got 8 hours think you can
[1:07:19] get it done he said we'll try I said now
[1:07:23] I'm not going to argue with you but at
[1:07:25] once in a while I'm going to say wait a
[1:07:26] minute now is this what you're saying
[1:07:29] you know I want to make sure that I
[1:07:31] understand 8 hours later I could have
[1:07:35] took the doctrine of the two Soul people
[1:07:37] of this
[1:07:38] message and laid it identically in the
[1:07:41] Mormon doctrine of
[1:07:45] pre-existence all
[1:07:48] right not trying to be nasty trying to
[1:07:50] be right cuz you see I got to know what
[1:07:52] I'm talking about that's right right but
[1:07:55] what about this great
[1:07:59] mystery what about this point that a
[1:08:03] prophet would make that we come from a
[1:08:06] higher being that we were there as the
[1:08:08] eternal life that's within us not
[1:08:10] peoples now not bodies not Spirits not
[1:08:13] Souls of anything we're looking at but
[1:08:16] not just in God's mind but to be part of
[1:08:19] the very God
[1:08:20] itself there's his
[1:08:22] offspring
[1:08:25] if it would call you his offspring on
[1:08:27] Earth how much more would it be there
[1:08:30] when the morning Stars s together in the
[1:08:32] sons of God shouted for Joy
[1:08:36] right the prophet saying Jesus told his
[1:08:40] disciples that I was with you before the
[1:08:42] foundation of the world Amen that you
[1:08:45] was in the
[1:08:46] beginning you can't know what he
[1:08:50] said but you was in the
[1:08:52] beginning
[1:08:56] all right then we went
[1:09:00] into the acts of the Believers down
[1:09:02] Through the
[1:09:04] Ages would you not agree at least with
[1:09:07] the New Testament form of the baptism of
[1:09:09] the Holy Ghost coming into our hearts
[1:09:11] and souls that would make us The
[1:09:13] Offspring of
[1:09:15] God if you don't agree with that then my
[1:09:18] Lord what are you agreeing
[1:09:21] with I mean
[1:09:25] well I never all I want to do is just
[1:09:27] get my kid saved that's what a man told
[1:09:30] me one
[1:09:31] day I backed
[1:09:34] off because I wanted to tell him if he'd
[1:09:37] have lived right and done right before
[1:09:39] him it might have helped what I was
[1:09:41] trying to
[1:09:43] do but I'm not that
[1:09:47] dirty I'm not that mean there's a heart
[1:09:49] down in this man that beats that cries
[1:09:52] at night
[1:09:54] to try to find a way to express what God
[1:09:57] has made known by way of a prophet to
[1:10:01] you and I
[1:10:04] amen what is this great mystery brother
[1:10:10] Brandon simplify it to us we can talk
[1:10:14] about back there we can talk about down
[1:10:16] Through the Ages as being The Offspring
[1:10:18] of God
[1:10:21] simplified all right go ahead with
[1:10:22] number nine excuse yeah number nine no
[1:10:25] no number 10 you do got number nine
[1:10:29] paragraph
[1:10:31] 184 Christ a mystery look what he says
[1:10:35] this is going on the way over into the
[1:10:37] book look what he comes to he says
[1:10:42] predestinated he said there's the
[1:10:47] mystery what is the
[1:10:50] mystery of Revelations
[1:10:52] 10:7
[1:10:54] when the days of the voice of the
[1:10:55] seventh angel begin to sound the mystery
[1:10:58] singular it does not say Mysteries there
[1:11:01] read your
[1:11:03] Bible it's summed up all with this
[1:11:06] message in the end time that's why I
[1:11:08] believe this message is a headstone to
[1:11:10] the church I believe that I always have
[1:11:12] taught it I don't mind telling you what
[1:11:14] I
[1:11:15] believe look predestinated THS the
[1:11:17] mystery he before Christ or anything
[1:11:21] else was ever on earth you see his great
[1:11:25] mystery that he chose the
[1:11:31] bride now there is an eternal purpose
[1:11:33] and plan there's predestinated which
[1:11:37] means Destiny determined
[1:11:42] beforehand I didn't write
[1:11:46] this that he chose the bride now watch
[1:11:49] he knows so much of the truth he has to
[1:11:51] put it together for us to understand
[1:11:53] look knowing Eve would
[1:11:56] fall not just choosing a
[1:12:01] bride not just there's many women down
[1:12:04] here and I'll choose a
[1:12:11] bride knowing Eve would fall from
[1:12:14] disbelieving the word knowing that she
[1:12:16] would fall but he would choose a bride
[1:12:19] that would not
[1:12:20] fall that would hold to that word
[1:12:23] regardless of what all the rest of the
[1:12:25] world had to say about
[1:12:27] it they would hold to that word they are
[1:12:30] predestinated to stand there the
[1:12:33] adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[1:12:38] predestinated the church to that great
[1:12:40] glorious
[1:12:46] stand he predestinated a
[1:12:49] bride he predestinated
[1:12:52] offspring
[1:12:54] he predestinated his own
[1:12:56] children amen cuz there's you seed
[1:13:00] y there's your
[1:13:03] seed it's not the not the person that
[1:13:06] comes predestinated eternally right 154
[1:13:09] Church a book he said but it's the seed
[1:13:10] of
[1:13:11] word all
[1:13:13] right so it's not me and you looking
[1:13:15] what you're looking at it's not this
[1:13:16] that you're looking at is predestinated
[1:13:18] eternal we're going to get to it this is
[1:13:20] for knowledge right amen but God before
[1:13:24] the world knew what we'd look like we
[1:13:25] read that to start with didn't
[1:13:27] we did he knew what we'd look
[1:13:31] like
[1:13:33] listen look what he says on go ahead
[1:13:36] number
[1:13:37] 11 identification 64 216 paragraph 58
[1:13:42] but see all that is is displaying
[1:13:45] showing by type like the whole Bible God
[1:13:49] coming together with a redeemed Bri wife
[1:13:52] of Bride that God had in his mind before
[1:13:56] the foundation of the world now we read
[1:13:58] to start with that he had in his mind to
[1:14:00] make Man In His
[1:14:03] Image are you beginning to catch on to
[1:14:05] that that he he had in his mind to make
[1:14:07] man in his own image he had in his mind
[1:14:10] to make his offspring to bring his
[1:14:11] children into being now look what he
[1:14:14] calls
[1:14:20] him he calls him a wife cuz remember it
[1:14:23] is brother dick likes this he's on the
[1:14:25] internet he'll
[1:14:26] Scout over in Revelations uh what is it
[1:14:29] 19 or 13 which one where it said and his
[1:14:33] wife hath made herself ready it don't
[1:14:36] say and his
[1:14:41] bride says his
[1:14:43] wife has made herself ready a bride that
[1:14:47] God had in his mind for the foundation
[1:14:48] world look that was the attributes of
[1:14:52] God being
[1:14:54] displayed and now to make a character
[1:14:58] that could redeem this woman it had to
[1:15:00] be something greater than her to redeem
[1:15:03] her and you ever notice so now you know
[1:15:06] who he's talking about who he had to
[1:15:07] make okay one
[1:15:10] more what about
[1:15:15] it we read in
[1:15:18] Ephesians bring up 13 first to
[1:15:22] 12
[1:15:23] one we read in Ephesians having made
[1:15:26] known unto us the mystery of his will
[1:15:29] according to his good pleasure which he
[1:15:32] had purposed in
[1:15:35] himself remember he swore by
[1:15:37] himself abut right that it what that in
[1:15:41] the dispensation of the fullness of
[1:15:43] times you might gather together in one
[1:15:46] all things in Christ both which are in
[1:15:49] heaven and which are on earth even in
[1:15:52] him what that in the dispensation of the
[1:15:54] fullness remember the quote we just read
[1:15:57] he would choose a bride knowing she
[1:15:59] would
[1:16:03] fall are you with me but knowing that he
[1:16:07] would
[1:16:08] predestinate a people that would not
[1:16:13] fall that's why they without us cannot
[1:16:15] be made perfect that's what he's talking
[1:16:17] about that in the dispensation of the
[1:16:19] fullness of time in other words the end
[1:16:20] of
[1:16:21] times somebody's going realize what's
[1:16:23] going on in whom also we have obtained
[1:16:26] what an inheritance remember Jesus never
[1:16:30] gave us an
[1:16:33] inheritance he only come to deliver the
[1:16:35] inheritance to us he never gave us an
[1:16:38] inheritance that's brother random come
[1:16:42] on our inheritance was eternal life
[1:16:46] before the foundation of the world Amen
[1:16:49] I'm quoting brother
[1:16:52] brandham
[1:16:54] all
[1:16:56] right in whom also we have obtained an
[1:16:59] inheritance what being
[1:17:03] predestinated determined before the
[1:17:05] world ever
[1:17:06] begun that there'd be a group of people
[1:17:09] in the end time that would not may I
[1:17:10] quote it
[1:17:12] from looking at the book I can't get the
[1:17:14] name
[1:17:16] uh where he said that she won't fall
[1:17:20] like Eve fell
[1:17:24] God of this evil age I guess no no it's
[1:17:27] not it it's a green book okay forget it
[1:17:29] I'll get the quote according to the
[1:17:31] purpose of him who worketh all things
[1:17:34] after the counsel of his own will go
[1:17:36] back and read will will will how much I
[1:17:39] told you when I
[1:17:41] started that we would not read anywhere
[1:17:43] else but Ephesians 1
[1:17:46] 3-14 how mean you remember that why
[1:17:49] because within that is the fall the the
[1:17:53] the before the world the coming into the
[1:17:55] world the fall of mankind and the
[1:17:57] Regeneration of mankind is in Ephesians
[1:18:00] 1 3
[1:18:02] through
[1:18:05] 14 I don't you have to go anywhere else
[1:18:07] in the
[1:18:08] Bible but think about
[1:18:11] it now watch this last
[1:18:14] part go ahead with number
[1:18:16] 12 this is from Christ of mystery God
[1:18:20] reveal paragraph one
[1:18:25] 54-6 he is the first fruits of the
[1:18:28] Resurrection is that right congregation
[1:18:30] says amen watch then what is he he is
[1:18:34] the head of the body which is his church
[1:18:38] bride uh-huh then the bride body must
[1:18:42] follow the
[1:18:44] head for it is part of his
[1:18:49] resurrection
[1:18:51] and might have a little a little bit to
[1:18:53] do with his mystery some way in there
[1:18:55] you know could maybe
[1:18:56] something what did he
[1:19:00] say she's part of his resurrection and
[1:19:03] she's part of his
[1:19:08] mystery it's impossible for it not to go
[1:19:11] oh my it's part of God's
[1:19:13] mystery how God revealed himself here
[1:19:16] and raised it up by the word so he
[1:19:18] Reveals His church and raises it up by
[1:19:20] the same word it is a part part of his
[1:19:23] threefold
[1:19:25] mystery you mean to say that you and I
[1:19:28] are a part of God's
[1:19:32] mystery part of a three-fold
[1:19:35] mystery I thought according to Christ
[1:19:37] the mystery God revealed that the
[1:19:39] three-fold mystery was
[1:19:43] what all God was he poured into Christ
[1:19:46] that's right on Christ he pours into the
[1:19:51] church I thought brother ROM said do you
[1:19:53] want these that the bride would be the
[1:19:56] fullness of the godhead bodily in the
[1:19:58] last days amen of course that was quoted
[1:20:01] to a big man in this message you know
[1:20:02] what he said hog
[1:20:04] wash well he can hog all his was he
[1:20:06] wants to I don't care I didn't say it
[1:20:09] brother brandham did
[1:20:11] am in other words he was bling making
[1:20:14] fun of brother brandham that's his own
[1:20:15] business cuz that's what he done he said
[1:20:20] Hogwart of course the same man said said
[1:20:22] it this way he said the third pull was
[1:20:25] for brother brandom and Jesus Christ and
[1:20:28] not for nobody
[1:20:31] else now may I quote brother
[1:20:34] brandom I thought brother brandom said
[1:20:37] the third pool was far the bride and the
[1:20:43] church and to the totally
[1:20:47] lost he even said the third pull is to
[1:20:49] the
[1:20:51] church
[1:20:53] y now you know he ain't talking about
[1:20:55] bride there come
[1:20:57] on would you see what I'm talking
[1:21:03] about see unveiling of God is
[1:21:09] great you ever notice brother Brandon
[1:21:11] preached that and read the message and
[1:21:14] listen to it very
[1:21:16] carefully the unveiling of
[1:21:19] God and he brought him down and unveiled
[1:21:22] him
[1:21:24] on
[1:21:27] Earth but go to a message called The
[1:21:30] Mighty God
[1:21:33] unveiled and listen to that
[1:21:36] one he brings it right down to the
[1:21:42] church she's part of the
[1:21:45] mystery and got to be reveal that's
[1:21:47] right what am I trying to do brother
[1:21:49] what are you trying to do brother there
[1:21:50] I'm trying to reveal you
[1:21:53] y now get upset with me and all and just
[1:21:56] get all he fatter in your minds and
[1:21:58] things and well boy he's just so deep he
[1:22:01] can't understand we can't follow what's
[1:22:03] more simple than for me talking about
[1:22:08] you you see that's why I don't make L of
[1:22:12] nobody I don't make no fun of nobody
[1:22:14] that ever turns against
[1:22:18] me I don't do
[1:22:20] nobody I don't say will they or not he
[1:22:23] boy BL God he when he was meeting on
[1:22:29] uhuh because see I want to see everybody
[1:22:34] there
[1:22:37] right I know when realize it won't
[1:22:39] happen but that's right still what's the
[1:22:42] problem why can't somebody differ with
[1:22:44] you a little bit and you not get so
[1:22:46] upset and
[1:22:48] mad that's
[1:22:51] right like I told you about a man
[1:22:53] leaving a church because they asked him
[1:22:56] to take up an
[1:22:58] offering and he was a preacher in that
[1:23:02] church and he said a preacher is not
[1:23:03] supposed to take up an offering and he
[1:23:06] left the
[1:23:08] church you go around and check all these
[1:23:10] little doctrines that people leave
[1:23:11] churches
[1:23:20] about you didn't ever hear Brother
[1:23:22] random talk like that
[1:23:27] that's he always had open arms for
[1:23:32] everybody cuz he said that's between you
[1:23:34] and
[1:23:37] God he never throw off on
[1:23:43] nobody he always spoke well of his
[1:23:45] enemies like they said Billy Paul I
[1:23:47] believe was the one that said it one of
[1:23:48] them did said you couldn't tell the
[1:23:50] difference in brother Brown's enemies
[1:23:51] and his friends
[1:23:56] that's right well it's like I've said
[1:23:59] how would it be that I'm over here
[1:24:01] throwing off on brother collie and I'm
[1:24:03] really lambasting him and I'm just
[1:24:05] calling his name and I'm rubbing him
[1:24:07] over the and he's wouldn't be here
[1:24:09] tonight but he'd be at home on his knees
[1:24:12] praying and saying God help that man he
[1:24:15] don't he don't mean it just help him now
[1:24:19] which one's God going to
[1:24:21] hear
[1:24:26] he put your little feelings in the city

[1:25:38] towards the earth
[1:25:40] now but before we leave it can you see
[1:25:42] his plan and
