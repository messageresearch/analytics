[4:57] Genesis chapter 1 Genesis chapter 1
[5:02] praise the Lord then after that we'll
[5:09] read Genesis John chapter 1 the reason
[5:13] why I say we don't know when it would
[5:14] get the priest because now we have all
[5:16] these brothers there again ready to
[5:17] start coming through and and so just no
[5:21] telling but but we'll just do the best
[5:26] we can amen praise the Lord I want to
[5:31] title this tonight I want to call this
[5:34] when God saw the light when God saw the
[5:37] light amen
[5:38] and this light that we're just going to
[5:41] discuss about talked about this light
[5:42] that's like here isn't what you think it
[5:46] is and yet it is what you think it is
[5:49] praise the Lord let's read it in Genesis
[5:52] 1 in the beginning God created the
[5:54] heaven and the earth and the earth was
[5:57] without form and void and darkness was
[6:00] upon the face of the deep and the Spirit
[6:03] of God moved upon the face of the waters
[6:06] and God said let there be light and
[6:10] there was light
[6:12] and God saw the light that's where I got
[6:15] my little title from and God saw the
[6:17] light that it was good and God divided
[6:21] the light
[6:22] the darkness they immediately God takes
[6:24] and divides that light from darkness
[6:26] praise God and God called the light day
[6:29] and the darkness he called night and the
[6:33] evening and the morning were the first
[6:35] days
[6:36] now let's look at John chapter 1 very
[6:39] familiar scripture to all of us but a
[6:42] very powerful scripture amen John
[6:46] chapter 1 verse 1 in the beginning was
[6:49] the word and the Word was with God and
[6:52] the Word was God the same was in the
[6:57] beginning with God all things were made
[7:01] by him and without him was not anything
[7:05] made that was made
[7:07] in him was life and the life was the
[7:11] light of men and the light shyness in
[7:15] darkness and the darkness comprehended
[7:17] it not praise the Lord Jesus let's just
[7:20] go to the Lord in prayer before you're
[7:21] seated our Heavenly Father we thank you
[7:24] Lord for the opportunity to open back
[7:26] the pages of your word Lord Jesus as a
[7:29] human father God we're we're limited to
[7:32] what we can do father God but we know
[7:35] that there's no limited father it by you
[7:36] through your Holy Spirit Lord Jesus so
[7:39] father we would ask that you would just
[7:41] be the the one that speak tonight Lord
[7:43] God we invite your presence in our midst
[7:45] Lord and father God just stopped me from
[7:48] saying anything that I should not say
[7:50] Lord and open our ears of our
[7:53] understanding that we would hear what
[7:55] you would have want us to hear Lord God
[7:57] that we may grow to be more like you
[8:00] Lord for that's our desire Lord and I
[8:02] believe that's my brother and sisters
[8:03] desire Lord Jesus Lord Lord God Almighty
[8:06] we've done what we can father a studying
[8:09] and and labored father in your word now
[8:11] father God we just ask that you take the
[8:13] preeminence Lord Jesus you do the rest
[8:15] now in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus
[8:18] Christ we commit this service into your
[8:19] hands now amen amen praise the Lord
[8:23] brother Terrence or Terrence sorry I let
[8:27] the I left a cup of water in the office
[8:32] that
[8:34] oh yeah yeah you can sit down oh sorry
[8:36] [Laughter]
[8:38] are you already seated down for work if
[8:41] you work a man phrase guy amen so
[8:49] tonight we want to we want to talk about
[8:52] this light now now reading here again in
[8:57] John chapter one thank you brother
[9:01] how we get a double portion oh wow thank
[9:06] you for the Bob appreciate it in in John
[9:12] chapter 1 here we see here that in the
[9:14] beginning was the word now when we read
[9:16] in Genesis chapter 1 it said in the
[9:18] beginning God created the heaven and the
[9:20] earth amen
[9:21] so who was there at the beginning of
[9:23] course we know that was Jesus Christ
[9:25] Jesus Christ all along
[9:27] amen praise God and the Bible says and
[9:30] the word was and the Word was with God
[9:32] and the Word was God and the same was in
[9:36] the beginning with God all things were
[9:39] made by him all things were made by him
[9:42] and without him was not anything made
[9:45] that was made
[9:46] amen and I like verse 4 in him was life
[9:49] and the life was the light of men so we
[9:53] see here that in this scripture that
[9:55] light and life are tied together when
[9:59] the scripture talks about light here in
[10:01] Genesis chapter 1 it's speaking about
[10:03] life as well amen
[10:05] because that's what God is they men God
[10:07] is life God is life amen praise God and
[10:10] we're going to just do a lot of reading
[10:12] and I just hope you all bear with me
[10:14] amen but we'll just do the best we can
[10:17] praise God you pray for me tonight amen
[10:19] and unto revelations chapter 3 verse 14
[10:23] says and those I've gave I've given them
[10:26] some of these scriptures so they can
[10:28] bring them up so I want you all to read
[10:29] along as well I believe this is one of
[10:32] the ones that I gave them it says and
[10:34] unto the Angel of the Church of the
[10:36] Laodiceans write these things saith the
[10:39] Amen the faithful and true witness the
[10:42] beginning of the creation of God so who
[10:45] is that beginning of the creation of God
[10:48] who was at the beginning Amen which it
[10:50] was the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[10:52] praise God and in Colossians chapter 1
[10:55] verse 12 it says given thanks unto the
[10:59] Father which hath made us meet to be
[11:01] partakers of the inheritance of the
[11:04] Saints in life
[11:05] verse 13 who hath delivered us from the
[11:08] power of darkness amen because in
[11:12] Genesis chapter 1 as soon as the last
[11:14] unas God said let there be light
[11:15] darkness had to give way amen praise the
[11:19] Lord and has translated us into the
[11:21] kingdom of his dear son in whom we have
[11:25] redemption through his blood even the
[11:28] forgiveness of sins aren't you thankful
[11:30] for that amen verse 15 I like this who
[11:34] is the image of the invisible God the
[11:37] firstborn of every creature now remember
[11:41] this is Jesus Christ the whole time for
[11:43] by him we were all things created they
[11:47] are in heaven and that are in earth
[11:49] visible and invisible now we're going to
[11:54] look at something just a little bit in
[11:56] just a little bit about that visible and
[11:58] invisible it's amazing how science has
[12:02] proven they're trying to disprove God
[12:05] but yet they're proving God amen I mean
[12:09] that that's just in it and it's all you
[12:11] know it's just like brother Branham said
[12:12] Satan is just a tool in the hands of God
[12:15] amen and so that's because man when they
[12:19] come face-to-face with God they just
[12:20] won't have an excuse they won't have an
[12:23] excuse and so for verse 16 for by him
[12:26] we're all things created are in heaven
[12:28] and on earth visible and invisible
[12:29] whether they be Thrones or dominions or
[12:33] principalities or powers all things were
[12:37] created by him and for him now remember
[12:42] remember he is light praise God
[12:45] remember we're talking about light here
[12:47] not not now how to fish a life not just
[12:51] the light of the Sun we're talking about
[12:53] like equals life amen like equals life
[12:56] or powers all things were created by him
[12:59] and for him and he is before all thing
[13:01] and by him all things consist they men
[13:05] praise God so light in life we know
[13:09] there's connected and we know that both
[13:11] Jesus Christ is both that light and life
[13:13] now because Jesus is life the creation
[13:18] could not come about until if that light
[13:23] was not manifested first amen
[13:26] so in other words if God had not said
[13:28] let there be light remember that light
[13:32] is life nothing else could have come
[13:35] about after that there would have been
[13:37] no plants there would have been no no no
[13:39] dirt no trees no animals no nothing else
[13:41] and as where the d'void was bringing out
[13:43] all these things that were they were
[13:46] placed and on earth for example this
[13:49] pulpit comes from wood from elements
[13:52] that were already placed back when God
[13:54] said let there be light and all these
[13:57] all these different things when he said
[13:59] let there be trees and all these this
[14:01] was already there and there and so
[14:05] because Jesus Christ is the crew is the
[14:08] beginning of the creation of God if he
[14:10] didn't come out of God first then there
[14:12] could not have been anything else they
[14:14] meant praise the Lord Jesus
[14:16] now Genesis 1:3 it says and God said let
[14:19] there be light and there was light let
[14:23] there be light and there was light
[14:24] I mean because whatever he says has to
[14:28] come to pass right amen
[14:30] praise God so when God said let there be
[14:32] light there was like two things took
[14:34] place they meant the thought of God was
[14:37] expressed in Word form Amen Jesus Christ
[14:41] came out of God which is we know he's
[14:43] the logo amen and the other thing the
[14:46] second thing that came out was that
[14:47] light was manifested Jesus Christ which
[14:51] is he his life which produces life came
[14:55] out into manifestation amen praise God
[14:58] so it wasn't just let there be light and
[15:03] the Sun came out no because when you
[15:07] keep reading later on in that same
[15:08] chapter the Sun and Moon come out to
[15:11] come to come later on amen praise God I
[15:14] will get to that dear
[15:15] the moment and out brother branham said
[15:17] here in the smyrna church age i want to
[15:21] bring this you can bring that quote up
[15:23] he says down through these centuries we
[15:26] could go we find a Moses a Jeremiah a
[15:29] John the Baptist and each one of these
[15:31] where God's eternal thoughts expressed
[15:33] in its season you are expressed in your
[15:36] season as well amen
[15:38] don't think that you're here just to be
[15:40] here in this age or that you're here
[15:42] because Oh somebody something you might
[15:44] say oh I wish I was living in Luther's
[15:45] age or I wish I was living no you're
[15:47] here because God needed you here you're
[15:50] to express Jesus Christ to this world to
[15:53] this generation amen nobody else could
[15:55] take your place then we come to Jesus
[15:58] the logos he was the perfect and
[16:01] complete thought expressed and he became
[16:05] expressed and he became known as the
[16:08] word just as John 1 declares he meant
[16:11] that is what he is and forever will be
[16:15] remember he is light now it says that he
[16:19] has chosen us in him in Jesus before the
[16:23] foundation of the world that means that
[16:26] we were right there with him in the mind
[16:29] and thoughts of God before the
[16:33] foundation of the world so you were
[16:36] right there with him amen before God
[16:39] said let there be light and his thoughts
[16:42] amen
[16:43] I like this it says that gives an
[16:46] eternal quality to the elect
[16:48] Amen you can't get away from that praise
[16:52] God you can't get away a true child and
[16:55] son and daughter of God can't get away
[16:57] from the fact that they come from God
[17:00] and when that is revealed to you now see
[17:03] we're talking about your position to now
[17:05] we're talking about the bride amen
[17:07] right because that's what it boils down
[17:09] to amen
[17:10] recognizing your position recognizing
[17:12] who you are and what power that is
[17:15] bestowed in in you amen
[17:18] before the foundation of the world they
[17:20] met praise God let's bring up the
[17:22] Ephesians chapter 1
[17:28] I was I was God I preached this message
[17:33] a few years ago and but you know as you
[17:37] grow and you see a little bit more you
[17:41] know you kind of start you kind of start
[17:43] seeing so and brother Wade was bringing
[17:45] out some things on Sunday that just kind
[17:49] of sparked sparked some of this a little
[17:51] bit better so thank God amen Ephesians
[17:54] one three five says blessed be the God
[17:57] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who
[17:59] has blessed us with all spiritual
[18:01] blessings in heavenly places in Christ
[18:04] according as he hath chosen us in him
[18:07] before the foundation of the world amen
[18:10] the scripture says that about us the
[18:13] problem is is we have a hard time
[18:15] believing those things and because we
[18:17] don't believe that we can't act upon the
[18:20] authority that Christ has given us amen
[18:23] now I'm not just not to say that you
[18:25] don't believe it because you believe his
[18:27] word right but it's hard to think that's
[18:29] me
[18:29] it's hard to put yourself in that in
[18:31] that scripture that that's me that
[18:33] that's who Christ is talking about the
[18:35] crisis talking about you Amen that we
[18:39] should be holy and without blame before
[18:41] him in love you believe that you're
[18:43] without blame Amen
[18:47] no matter what I have done throughout
[18:49] the week no matter what has happened if
[18:50] it's under the blood I'm without blamed
[18:52] right amen now it's up to you if you're
[18:55] going to have it under the blood or not
[18:56] right that's between you and God
[18:58] but if it's under the blood I'm without
[19:02] blame before him amen having
[19:04] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[19:07] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[19:08] according to the good pleasure of his
[19:11] will
[19:11] amen praise the Lord Jesus so you're you
[19:15] are part of that logos amen you are part
[19:20] of that part that came out of God amen
[19:21] when God you're just as much that that
[19:25] part of that logos as Jesus Christ was
[19:28] part of God amen now we know Jesus
[19:30] Christ that's not a second second person
[19:32] but that was just the son expressed Amen
[19:35] it's the same God amen
[19:37] praise the Lord Jesus and that's what
[19:39] God wants us to realize
[19:41] amen so there you being his child you
[19:47] being his child connected to Jesus
[19:50] Christ who is liked and who is life you
[19:53] can only manifest that as well a choose
[19:58] daughter and son of God can only
[20:00] manifest light in life amen
[20:02] because he is light in life if you come
[20:05] out of him that's the only thing that
[20:07] you can manifest amen is light in life
[20:09] now I'm going to read here let's bring
[20:13] up the next quote I believe I believe
[20:16] brother Wade read this one Sunday we're
[20:23] going to talk about Genesis 1:26 men
[20:25] here for just a moment now now if God
[20:27] created man in his own image and in his
[20:30] own likeness what kind of man did he
[20:32] create a spirit man now if you notice
[20:35] after he had made all the creation and
[20:37] created a spirit man the close reading
[20:39] of this now to the one to ask the
[20:41] question all right let's just scroll
[20:43] down see he was in other words Adam the
[20:46] first man in the lower creations of God
[20:48] the first creation was God himself then
[20:51] out of God came to logos all right I pay
[20:56] attention to this out of God came to
[20:57] logos that that was that low cost Jesus
[21:00] Christ which was the son of God
[21:02] then out of the logos which was the word
[21:05] in the beginning was the word in the
[21:07] Word was with God and the Word was God
[21:09] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[21:10] among us out of the logos came forth the
[21:13] man now this man that he's speaking
[21:15] about is that Genesis 1:26 man a man
[21:18] that spirit man that who is that man I
[21:25] can't be nothing more but this but God
[21:28] himself and we'll read here in just a
[21:30] moment where brother Branham says that
[21:32] amen
[21:34] praise God because it's just as he has
[21:38] note that he has no limits no boundaries
[21:40] no nose no nothing this Genesis 1:26 men
[21:45] and we will read that here in just a
[21:47] moment I got some goodies man I was
[21:51] looking up some stuff and you know you
[21:54] you're getting weird and you
[21:55] tired of you know studying and then all
[21:59] of a sudden God just gives you something
[22:01] man and just gives you like my goodness
[22:03] issue right then just wakes you back up
[22:06] I didn't even need coffee I just I
[22:10] coulda leave that that that was just
[22:13] lame
[22:13] that was laying in there hey man praise
[22:15] God I hope it may maybe it was just for
[22:18] me may not bless you as much as it
[22:19] blessed me amen but I hope you get a
[22:21] blessing out everything man
[22:22] now there's a difference between this
[22:24] light of God that from Genesis 1 and in
[22:28] the light of the Sun Genesis 1 says that
[22:32] we were just read in the beginning God
[22:33] created the heaven and the earth and the
[22:35] earth was without form and void and
[22:37] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[22:39] and the Spirit of God moved upon the
[22:40] face of the water and God said let there
[22:43] be light and there was light
[22:44] amen so this is not this light here is
[22:47] not that light from Genesis 1:14 and
[22:51] through 18
[22:52] it's totally separate light which is
[22:55] life amen
[22:56] now that light if you look up in the
[22:58] hebrew lexicon it they can bring that up
[23:01] that light in genesis 1 of 3 that word
[23:07] light it's the same word that was used
[23:09] for the other lights as well for
[23:11] describing the sun the moon the stars
[23:14] but I like this amen is that it is the
[23:18] light of day light of heavenly
[23:19] luminaries the Sun but if you go down it
[23:22] says light of life amen
[23:25] and then I like where it says Jehovah is
[23:27] Israel's life so Jehovah being that in
[23:33] other words a person if he meant he is
[23:35] that light Amen so that light was
[23:38] totally different from the from the Sun
[23:40] Moon and stars amen
[23:41] and then and we'll just read it here
[23:44] just a moment we'll read it now to bring
[23:47] up Genesis 1:14 says then God said let
[23:51] there be lights in the firmament of the
[23:53] heaven to divide the day from the night
[23:55] and let them be for signs and for
[23:57] seasons and for days and years and let
[24:00] them be for lights in the firmament of
[24:02] heaven to give light or what upon the
[24:05] earth
[24:06] right they didn't say that in Jenna
[24:09] is one verse three but these lights
[24:11] right here are to give light upon the
[24:14] earth de mettre and it was so God's word
[24:18] amen and God made two great lights the
[24:21] greater light to rule the day and the
[24:23] lesser light to rule the night he made
[24:27] the stars also amen
[24:29] and God set them in the firmament of the
[24:31] heaven to give light where upon the
[24:34] earth so these were the heavenly
[24:38] celestial bodies they meant the sun the
[24:40] moon the stars amen
[24:41] totally different from that light from
[24:43] the beginning amen into rulers a and
[24:45] over the night and to divide the light
[24:47] from the darkness and God saw that it
[24:49] was good you see how important God he
[24:51] loves to divide in the beginning he
[24:55] divided the light from darkness and when
[24:57] he created the Sun the moon amen he made
[25:00] a division there as well
[25:02] one to rule the night one to rule the
[25:04] day amen but now the Sun the moon came
[25:07] from King can't produce its own light it
[25:10] gets the light from the Sun amen praise
[25:13] God amen so we're not going to beat that
[25:17] point there too we see that clearly Amen
[25:21] there in Genesis now just as the Sun and
[25:28] Moon there are further extensions of God
[25:31] right there are further extensions of
[25:34] when God said let there be light
[25:36] right amen further further extensions of
[25:39] his word of the manifestations of his
[25:42] word amen
[25:43] just as they are further extensions of
[25:46] God's Word the son of God and the bride
[25:49] or further extensions of God amen praise
[25:52] the Lord Jesus they're both the same you
[25:57] can't separate one from the other amen
[26:00] remember brother Branham he would he
[26:02] would talk about the Sun represent the
[26:07] represented by the Sun Esso and Jesus
[26:09] Christ amen and the bride is being
[26:12] represented by the moon amen praise God
[26:15] and so as the moon can't reflect her own
[26:18] light - amen its own life neither can
[26:20] the bride reflect her own light amen
[26:22] unless it's the light the light that she
[26:24] got from her begotten Amen that's the
[26:27] light that reflects now I don't know
[26:28] about you Amen but I don't want to
[26:30] reflect my own light amen
[26:32] I don't want to reflect my own word I
[26:34] don't want to I don't want to shine
[26:35] something that I came up on my own
[26:37] that's not what God is interested in
[26:39] amen I want to reflect what he has in
[26:41] mind amen I reflect the way he has
[26:44] placed me here to reflect which is his
[26:46] word amen that's what I want to reflect
[26:49] so this dying generation because the
[26:51] giant generation can't that they're not
[26:54] going to nothing's going to come about
[26:57] if I'm trying to show them my own thing
[26:59] amen
[27:00] but if I show them something that
[27:01] reflects from the mind of God amen from
[27:03] his light amen something can come out of
[27:05] that praise God I can't make a plant
[27:08] grow I neither can you and it's sort of
[27:14] tough to make a plant grow with
[27:15] artificial light and stuff but you put
[27:17] out a plant in there in the regular
[27:18] sunlight amen it just naturally it just
[27:22] grabs it gravitates to that light amen
[27:25] praise God same thing with the people
[27:27] out here in the world do you know that
[27:29] the people here in the world they want
[27:31] to see a true living Jesus Christ that's
[27:35] why they're looking at the young people
[27:38] they look at superheroes and Captain
[27:41] America and spider-man and all these
[27:43] different things because they want to be
[27:46] and they want to feel like superheroes
[27:49] they're looking for a superhero and the
[27:52] superhero is in their midst is trying to
[27:56] talk to them through you and me praise
[27:58] God that's that we're the true
[28:03] superheroes I don't go around carrying
[28:06] the shield and I don't go around care
[28:08] the things out of my wrist or anything
[28:10] like that
[28:11] amen I just have the word amen the word
[28:14] and if you manifest your word to the
[28:16] people amen you grab somebody amen amen
[28:22] you grab somebody with the word leave oh
[28:24] you grab somebody with a word you don't
[28:26] need spider webs or anything like that
[28:28] amen manifest the word don't be ashamed
[28:32] young people
[28:34] don't be ashamed I tell I told my
[28:36] daughter's I said I tell them I said
[28:38] don't be ashamed of Jesus Christ in
[28:41] school don't be ashamed of bowing your
[28:44] head to pray for your food because other
[28:48] people may wonder what he or he or she
[28:50] doing and then because they asked they
[28:53] may not have even seen that before and
[28:55] that's an opportunity for you to tell
[28:57] them and they're like hey I want to know
[28:58] more about that but a lot of us have in
[29:01] our minds that we think that they're
[29:02] just going to reject us and they're
[29:03] gonna think we're you know we don't want
[29:05] to be with them we don't want to hang
[29:07] out with it he prays before he eats
[29:10] that's your opportunity to show the
[29:12] world amen praise the Lord Amen now
[29:19] let's bring up let's talk about Adam and
[29:20] Eve and for just a moment praise the
[29:24] Lord
[29:25] how many are following Amen praise God
[29:30] let's bring up that the next quote which
[29:33] is the cruelty of sin and the penalty
[29:35] that it costs to rid sin from our lives
[29:37] brother Branham says here and then he
[29:40] created all his creations then after he
[29:43] made it all the trees come up and the
[29:45] plants and so forth what a beautiful
[29:47] setup he had he loved it it was
[29:50] beautiful and he thought that was fine
[29:52] now watch this so he couldn't just leave
[29:56] it in that state he had to leave
[29:58] something with it so he said let us
[30:00] plural make man plural in our own image
[30:04] let us make man in our own image so then
[30:08] when God made his first man he was a
[30:10] spirit man right he was something on the
[30:14] order of God or the Son of God the logos
[30:18] that was the first man then he gave the
[30:25] man jurisdiction over to lead all the
[30:26] animal life just like the Holy Spirit
[30:28] leads the believer today amen praise God
[30:33] my brother Wade said decide this uh this
[30:36] Sunday that he read a quote from 53 that
[30:40] was in 1953 amen next next next next
[30:45] quote
[30:47] I think brother Wade read this one on
[30:49] Sunday now the worlds without form and
[30:51] void and water was upon the deep we're
[30:53] in Genesis one now see then he made all
[30:55] the plant life then after a while he
[30:57] made man in his own image and if he made
[30:59] man in his own image he had to make him
[31:01] something of an order of that
[31:03] supernatural being a man this man this
[31:07] Genesis 1:26 men amen
[31:09] whoo-hoo you and me I meant if we're
[31:12] born again also came out of him just
[31:14] like that is a man we're destined to go
[31:17] back to that amen praise the Lord but
[31:20] this time with our bodies redeemed as
[31:22] well praise God now I think I think this
[31:28] one was the one that brother Wade rode
[31:30] the next the next one that's why the
[31:33] Bible says I'm sorry that's what about
[31:35] says the earth is groaning crying
[31:37] waiting for the manifestation of the
[31:38] sons of God the world is waiting for the
[31:40] man to come back into his riders state
[31:42] amen now he is made in the image and
[31:46] likeness of God that makes his when God
[31:48] made him God gave him some of his spirit
[31:50] part of his life amen
[31:53] and he's in in the likeness of the image
[31:55] of God amen
[31:56] so that man was just as much light as
[31:59] God his light amen
[32:01] praise the Lord so when Adam he came on
[32:03] the scene in spirit form he was we know
[32:06] that he was both male and female praise
[32:08] God and Eve was in him although she was
[32:12] not expressed but she was just as
[32:15] eternal as Adam was they meant they
[32:17] praise God amen now we're going to get
[32:21] to something here just a moment Genesis
[32:23] chapter 2 let's read Genesis chapter 2
[32:25] verse 18 and the Lord God said it is not
[32:30] good that the man should be alone I will
[32:33] make him an help meet for him I like
[32:35] that that that that brought that that
[32:38] the Lord mentions this and watch what he
[32:41] does in the next scripture and out of
[32:43] the ground the Lord God formed every
[32:44] beast of the field and every fowl of the
[32:46] air and brought them unto Adam to see
[32:50] what he would call him amen so instead
[32:53] of God given him his bride already he
[32:55] just puts Adam to work instead
[32:59] and I said revoir I preached a message a
[33:03] couple of years ago I think and said you
[33:08] know you young man you know you want a
[33:11] bride and you're looking for a wife you
[33:14] need to work first make sure you make
[33:18] sure you have a job you make sure you're
[33:20] seeking a wife make sure you have a task
[33:23] in hand because even God put Adam to put
[33:26] a task in hand before Eve was expressed
[33:30] amen then Eve came but Adam had to work
[33:34] first now it wasn't the sweat of his
[33:37] brow or anything but God gave him a task
[33:39] just as Jesus Christ and in John chapter
[33:42] 16 we'll read that later John 16 I
[33:44] believe or 17 when Jesus was praying he
[33:47] said Lord I've completed my work here
[33:49] amen and then it was after that amen
[33:53] after during his death that the bride
[33:55] and spirit spiritually came out of from
[33:57] his side amen praise God and out of the
[34:01] ground the Lord God formed every beast
[34:02] of the field and every fowl of the air
[34:04] and brought them unto Adam to see what
[34:06] he would call them not not what God
[34:08] would call them but to see what what
[34:10] Adam was call them amen because he knew
[34:13] that Adam and him Adam was not going to
[34:16] say anything outside of what he was
[34:18] thinking amen everything exactly that he
[34:21] was thinking God would just say amen
[34:23] praise the Lord and Adam called every
[34:27] living creature that was the name
[34:29] thereof period Genesis 220 and the Adam
[34:33] gave names to all cattle into the fowl
[34:35] of the air and to every beast of the
[34:36] field but for Adam there was not found
[34:38] and help meet for him so Adams is deer
[34:41] dealing with all the animals he sees
[34:43] that there's a male elephant and a
[34:45] female elephant a male dog and a female
[34:48] dog a male cat and a female cat a male
[34:51] duck and a female duck but he sees that
[34:55] his help meat is not dairy men praise
[34:58] God and and so in Genesis 2:21 it says
[35:04] and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to
[35:06] fall upon Adam and he slept and he took
[35:09] one of his ribs and closed up the flesh
[35:11] and
[35:12] so this is exactly what the Lord did for
[35:14] what the Lord did to our Lord Jesus
[35:16] Christ he put him to sleep as well
[35:19] because Jesus he died right well we know
[35:24] he slept and he died he was coming right
[35:27] back up amen
[35:29] it was only gone for a season Amen yet
[35:32] they had a ministry of work to do amen
[35:34] to release those Souls from prison amen
[35:36] praise God and the rib Genesis to 22 and
[35:40] the rib which the Lord God had taken
[35:41] from man made he a woman and I like I
[35:44] like the way the scripture presented and
[35:46] he brought her unto the man thank God
[35:49] just as God brought to Adam in the
[35:52] previous verses the animals to him to
[35:55] name God takes the rib God takes the
[35:58] bride or Eve out of his side and brings
[36:01] her to Adam and and it kind of reminds
[36:04] me of life went up when a when a groom
[36:06] is standing here waiting for his bride
[36:09] to come down the aisle you know he's all
[36:11] giddy she's so beautiful you know and
[36:15] the father is bringing her to him you
[36:17] know and they just thinking my that's my
[36:20] bride you know I can't imagine that's
[36:23] what god that's what Adam was thinking
[36:25] that's that's why God had for me amen
[36:28] but remember she was the whole time
[36:30] dwelling within him a man she was in him
[36:32] because Adam was male and female praise
[36:36] God the whole time was in but now she's
[36:39] been expressed amen praise God and Adam
[36:42] said this now bone of my bones and flesh
[36:45] of my flesh don't you think that she was
[36:47] more born of a bone flesh of his flesh
[36:49] when she was in him but now he says now
[36:52] this is now bone of my bone flesh of my
[36:54] flesh after this after that she was
[36:57] expressed this is now bone of my bone
[36:59] and flesh of my flesh praise God and she
[37:02] shall be called woman because she was
[37:04] taken out of man therefore saw a man
[37:08] leave his father and his mother and
[37:09] shall cleave unto his wife cleave unto
[37:12] his wife and they shall be one flesh
[37:16] Amen so do you believe you're one with
[37:19] Jesus Christ amen
[37:20] praise God brother Branham says in the
[37:23] message God's provided way
[37:26] I appreciate them bringing all these
[37:28] scriptures all these quotes and things
[37:30] now there's no need of praying for it to
[37:33] be changed it can't be changed for God's
[37:35] done said it wouldn't be changed the
[37:36] only thing to do is save yourself from
[37:39] this generation by looking to Jesus
[37:40] Christ
[37:41] xx in him and be borned into God's
[37:43] provided way the baptism of the Holy
[37:45] Spirit amen
[37:46] listen he died on the cross and there he
[37:49] bled he was took upon himself the form
[37:51] of sinful flesh he died in my stead he
[37:53] was just God took out of the side of
[37:56] Adam a rib and made a bride to him
[37:58] God opened up the side of Christ and
[38:00] taken out water blood and spirit for a
[38:03] bride further himself for Christ how
[38:06] beautiful amen and by one spirit not by
[38:08] one church membership by one spirit are
[38:10] we all baptized amen
[38:12] are we all baptized into one body and
[38:15] become members of that body amen praise
[38:17] God let's read the next one I know you
[38:21] might know these but good to refresh
[38:25] amen
[38:26] when Jesus suffered in that body he
[38:28] suffered because a man and woman are one
[38:30] person amen Eve was taken out of Adam
[38:33] and the church what happened God opened
[38:35] up the side of Adam and took out there a
[38:37] helpmate the bride and God opened up the
[38:41] side of Jesus at Calvary and took out
[38:44] the bride seat amen now now what's
[38:49] decided this is what I thought was
[38:51] interesting on I love this Jesus died at
[38:55] Calvary remember the bride was not taken
[38:56] from the body until the body was dead he
[39:00] had already died and they was going to
[39:02] break his legs and the Prophet said
[39:05] there will be not one bone broken so
[39:08] they done draw back the hammer to break
[39:10] a leg and a man run up with a spear and
[39:12] pushed it through his heart and water
[39:14] and blood came forth he was already dead
[39:17] she was already redeemed in the body by
[39:20] his death so there's no more suffering
[39:23] tribulation period for the bride
[39:26] CGT goes in praise god so that's that's
[39:29] one thing that types amen
[39:31] just as Jesus Christ was not going to
[39:34] suffer any Marmont he was already dead
[39:36] for a job but that but they was to
[39:38] fulfill the scripture that none of his
[39:40] bones were broken that bride was already
[39:42] coming out typing they meant that she
[39:44] was not going to suffer Amen before a
[39:47] bomb comes out and comes down Saints
[39:49] we're supposed to leave out of here amen
[39:50] praise God that's why I'm not afraid of
[39:52] what Russia will do that's why I'm not
[39:54] afraid of all these politics and all
[39:56] these things they men you know you all
[39:58] want to share things on Facebook and all
[40:00] these things up this is what I want to
[40:02] share tonight amen
[40:04] this is what I'm worried about amen
[40:07] I want to be like his look like him amen
[40:09] praise God because nothing of this world
[40:15] is going to deliver me it's going to
[40:16] give me a body change amen
[40:19] now let's talk about this uh have you
[40:22] heard of quantum mechanics before amen
[40:25] very interesting and it's something that
[40:29] Einstein delved into and as he was
[40:33] studying and he was looking and probing
[40:36] and he was you know he was nearing
[40:39] something but he just couldn't he
[40:43] couldn't get the spiritual aspect of it
[40:45] now Colossians chapter 1 and we read
[40:47] this earlier but let's look at it again
[40:49] Colossians chapter 1 verse 12 says given
[40:51] thanks unto the Father which hath made
[40:53] us meet to be partakers of the
[40:55] inheritance of the Saints in light who
[40:58] hath delivered us from the power of
[41:00] darkness amen and hath translated us
[41:03] into the kingdom of his dear son in whom
[41:06] we have redemption through his blood
[41:08] even the forgiveness of sins who is the
[41:12] image of the invisible God right this
[41:16] invisible God weak it cannot be seen but
[41:19] what was expressed through Jesus Christ
[41:21] amen and now we are expressing that
[41:26] invisible God amen praise the Lord the
[41:29] firstborn of every creature for by him
[41:31] we're all things created that are in
[41:33] heaven and on earth visible and
[41:35] invisible whether they be Thrones and
[41:37] dominions or principalities or powers
[41:39] things were created by him and for him
[41:41] and he is before all things and by all
[41:43] by all things by him all things consist
[41:45] now the the the basic rules of quantum
[41:51] mechanics is that everything is made up
[41:53] of little microscopic particles right
[41:56] there are these these things called
[41:58] quanta in quanta is the small fragments
[42:03] of atoms in other words Quantum's are
[42:07] made up of quanta and then atoms and
[42:11] then molecules are made up of atoms and
[42:14] then of course molecules is what makes
[42:16] up all matter whether it's living or
[42:19] nonliving and then everything that you
[42:20] touch is made up of molecules right and
[42:23] everything and all those molecules are
[42:24] made up of atoms and then all those
[42:26] atoms are made up of quanta amen praise
[42:29] God now okay every one of these uh of
[42:33] these quantum particles they are
[42:36] invisible they cannot be seen amen but
[42:41] yet they are making something visible
[42:43] and this is what scientists have have
[42:46] discovered there they're so small that
[42:50] they can they can they cannot be seen
[42:53] but yet they are making tangible things
[42:56] praise God now now I want you to listen
[43:01] to this it says that therefore all
[43:05] material objects are made up of
[43:07] invisible particles we do not fully
[43:09] understand how they operate but we now
[43:12] know this that everything we can see is
[43:14] made up of things that cannot be seen
[43:16] now what does the scripture say in
[43:18] Hebrews chapter 11 verse 3 it says
[43:20] through faith we understand that the
[43:22] worlds were framed by the Word of God by
[43:26] the Word of God so that things which are
[43:30] seen were not made of things which do
[43:33] appear praise God
[43:35] so God has God has all this heat he
[43:38] showed this this to us before they even
[43:41] discovered quantum mechanics amen this
[43:44] was already laying in the word praise
[43:45] God amen now one of the things that that
[43:49] that that holds all these all these
[43:52] things together
[43:53] quante the the atoms the molecules in
[43:57] the matter is all held by light in other
[44:03] words light is what is what ties all
[44:05] these things or meshes all these things
[44:07] together praise God
[44:09] so pretty much you and I these this
[44:12] pulpit everything around us all pretty
[44:14] much is what it is what is it solidified
[44:16] light it's pretty what it is they meant
[44:19] so think about it things think about
[44:21] when God said let there be light and
[44:24] there was light you Jesus Christ was
[44:27] there you and I was there everything was
[44:29] there and God God had already everything
[44:32] was already there Amen when when I was
[44:34] when this life everything dwelt in him
[44:36] all the expression all the things that
[44:38] he had already thought of was already in
[44:41] that gut when God said let there be
[44:43] light and there was light amen because
[44:45] remember light is what life that light
[44:48] amen praise God amen so and I kind of
[44:54] look at it like this this light that
[44:57] light or that solidified like that light
[44:59] is God
[45:01] we know that amen Adams is Jesus Christ
[45:05] right Jesus Christ in the Bride of
[45:09] Christ already there praise God the
[45:11] molecules we can tie that with the
[45:14] spirit man amen they can come out after
[45:16] the logos amen
[45:19] which was Jesus Christ and that spirit
[45:22] man were also in there as well that
[45:24] Bride of Christ amen because we're all
[45:27] attributes in the mind of God as well
[45:28] praise the Lord even though it was just
[45:30] Adam in the spirit man that was
[45:32] expressed at that time we were there as
[45:34] well praise God
[45:35] objects and then after that the objects
[45:38] the matter atom which is atom the flesh
[45:41] man which is the Bride of Christ as well
[45:43] amen
[45:44] the things that we can touch amen which
[45:46] is our flesh amen praise the Lord Jesus
[45:48] it's all tied up all tied up by light
[45:52] amen all these things are all tied by
[45:54] light and scientists have discovered
[45:57] that and they cages can't seem to get
[46:00] any further they get to a certain point
[46:04] and if they could just read the Bible
[46:07] and find Christ and and how and how
[46:12] simple Amen Christ is praise job I tell
[46:18] you what we'd be the world would be in a
[46:21] different condition Amen praise the Lord
[46:23] and so you know although we were
[46:28] invisible we were in God amen
[46:32] just as Eve was an Adam Amen now she
[46:37] wasn't visible she was not she was not
[46:39] visible but she was an Adam a man praise
[46:42] God that's why all these things they
[46:44] meant this quanta and these atoms and
[46:46] all these things there are they're
[46:48] invisible but they're all there because
[46:50] without these things science has proven
[46:53] you can't have this pulpit you can't
[46:56] have these physical things all these
[46:58] parts are not there amen praise God so
[47:01] light was created first nothing can be
[47:05] made without light right and everything
[47:09] is made up of unseen particles that's
[47:12] kind of strange that things are made up
[47:16] of things that are not seen amen but
[47:19] it's science
[47:19] amen and God had already declared that
[47:22] as we read there in Hebrews and science
[47:25] has proven that amen so the Bible was
[47:29] right before science was if you man
[47:33] praise the Lord now let's read let's
[47:36] read here at the right time
[47:45] tom is no more brother
[47:47] [Laughter]
[47:49] praise God now let's read the next quote
[47:52] bride in Christ that questions and
[47:55] answers how will it take place and and
[48:02] when is where is where is the where is
[48:06] it the bride goes this is the question a
[48:09] question that was given to brother
[48:11] Branham he says it goes to glory heaven
[48:14] for the wedding supper Justin type like
[48:17] Isaac and Rebekah when Rebecca went to
[48:19] meet Isaac
[48:21] remember alleles are represented now the
[48:23] message that went forth from Abraham
[48:25] Eliezer went forth to find a bride for
[48:27] Isaac he found a beautiful Rebekah in
[48:29] the cool of the evening a little
[48:32] dark-skinned girl coming out with a
[48:34] water pot on and Eliezer prayed said
[48:37] Lord give me good journey now and
[48:39] success for my master Abraham and he
[48:41] said go
[48:42] don't take him amongst his people now I
[48:45] like this showing that the Bride of
[48:47] Christ and Christ is blood relationship
[48:49] amen because Rebekah and Isaac were
[48:52] cousins amen praise the Lord Jesus amen
[48:57] so we're just we we have his blood amen
[49:00] we have his DNA we have all that he is
[49:05] we are praise God amen
[49:08] if you can of brother gene brother gene
[49:11] in Anderson South Carolina he would say
[49:12] if you can just phantom that if you can
[49:17] just fathom that amen if you could just
[49:19] if you could just think about that amen
[49:23] we wouldn't be so so sleepy of who you
[49:29] are
[49:29] amen of who you really are amen I was
[49:33] telling the brothers Sunday I think it
[49:35] was brother Don I was saying you know
[49:36] the same blood that flowing through my
[49:38] head right now is the same blood that's
[49:40] flowing down in my feet right now the
[49:42] same blood that's flowing through my
[49:44] legs is the same blood that's flowing
[49:45] through my arms amen
[49:47] it's all the same blood and it's the
[49:50] same blood amen that's flowing through
[49:51] the body of Christ amen
[49:53] the same DNA the same makeup the same
[49:55] everything amen that's why we can say he
[49:59] has confidence in us to say what he says
[50:02] amen and not speak outside of what he
[50:05] said amen
[50:07] because the Bride of Christ will only
[50:09] speak his word amen
[50:11] praise God now Genesis chapter 1 verse 4
[50:16] says thing and God saw the light that it
[50:20] was good and God divided the light from
[50:23] the darkness amen so God said let there
[50:28] be light in verse 3 and he saw that
[50:31] light and he said this is good
[50:35] said this is this is great this is what
[50:38] this is wonderful this is
[50:39] this is Who I am amen praise God God
[50:43] thought that it was good after Jesus the
[50:46] logos was revealed they men came came
[50:49] into manifestation Amen we know brother
[50:52] Browns preached that message Christ at
[50:54] the mystery of God revealed so let's
[50:57] look at it this way when God saw the
[50:59] light you could say and God saw God that
[51:02] it was good right brother Fidel I want
[51:07] to be corrected if I'm wrong amen if any
[51:09] of this doesn't sound right I want to be
[51:11] corrected amen and God saw God that it
[51:14] was good
[51:15] now first John 1:5 says God is light and
[51:18] in him is no darkness at all right but
[51:22] now let's bring it a little further it
[51:23] said and God saw Jesus Christ that it
[51:25] was good amen remember that that light
[51:30] is life amen
[51:31] john 8:12 says i am the light of the
[51:34] world jesus jesus speaking he that
[51:37] followeth me shall not walk in darkness
[51:39] but shall have the light of Life amen
[51:42] praise God well let's bring it down a
[51:45] little bit further and God saw the bride
[51:48] that it was good
[51:50] amen and Ephesians 5:8 says for ye were
[51:56] sometimes darkness remember there was
[51:59] all this darkness a man before God said
[52:02] let there be light amen
[52:03] but you were sometimes darkness but now
[52:06] are ye light in the Lord not that you
[52:09] have the light but now are ye light in
[52:12] the Lord so walk as children of light
[52:14] praise God amen
[52:17] I don't know about you but I you know
[52:20] the script that's what I see in that
[52:21] scripture amen
[52:22] praise God amen hallelujah I just thank
[52:26] God that's why that's why didn't need
[52:28] any coffee amen praise God now 1st
[52:33] Thessalonians 5 5 says ye are all the
[52:36] children of light and the children of
[52:39] the day amen we are not of the night nor
[52:44] of the darkness amen
[52:46] so God after he said
[52:48] there be light and there was light and
[52:50] God saw that the light was good and then
[52:52] in the next verse he says and he's in
[52:54] the first day and then the day and the
[52:57] night was the first day it really is
[52:59] something like that yeah something
[53:01] something like I think we'll read it
[53:03] here in just a moment so you are
[53:05] children of the day you're not children
[53:08] of the night that's all we don't hang
[53:10] around nightclubs cockroaches hang
[53:13] around nightclubs you know now you know
[53:17] the people they are they are blinded you
[53:20] know that they're Satan has had a
[53:22] grassland you know I was in that I was
[53:24] in that position at one point in time
[53:25] you know I was a I was a although I was
[53:29] in the mind of God I was I was I was I
[53:31] was predestinated to come to this but I
[53:34] was expressing darkness at some point in
[53:37] time I used to love the nightlife sneak
[53:40] out of the house and go do things I
[53:42] shouldn't be doing amen
[53:43] but see God changed me Amen from that
[53:46] and God has done the same thing for you
[53:48] and I a man changes from looking at
[53:50] darkness to looking now at day at day
[53:52] time a man I'd liked praise the Lord
[53:54] Jesus so now we're going to talk about
[53:57] God bringing the separation between
[53:59] light and darkness real quick because
[54:01] after God brought that light into
[54:03] manifestation what does he do
[54:06] immediately in verse four he says and
[54:08] God divided the light from darkness amen
[54:12] and that the Hebrew the Hebrew word
[54:15] there in the Hebrew lexicon is four
[54:18] divided is Badal which means to divide
[54:21] separate to divide separate sever sever
[54:25] to separate set apart there's a lot of
[54:28] different to be separated to withdraw
[54:30] from two separate oneself on two to be
[54:32] excluded and then so this a little
[54:35] darkness was to be excluded from the
[54:37] life amen you take kena can this door be
[54:40] open for the way yeah I don't know if
[54:44] I'll come back
[54:46] now let's just say it was dark in here
[54:49] right I saw all right now you see it's
[54:57] dark in here right we just have a little
[54:59] bit of glimmer of light now if I open
[55:03] this door
[55:04] what takes over the light takes over the
[55:08] darkness does not go outside it's the
[55:11] light that takes over amen praise God
[55:14] there for good sorry Billy
[55:21] we don't want y'all to go into REM mode
[55:25] you know where we you know you're sleepy
[55:28] now you know start dreaming if I leave
[55:30] those lights off praise God
[55:34] but light has to darkness has to give
[55:37] way when light comes in amen darkness
[55:39] cannot stand in the presence of light
[55:41] therefore when you as a Christian Amen
[55:44] you as a son and daughter of God you're
[55:46] standing out here in this middle of this
[55:47] darkness out here in this world amen
[55:50] darkness has to give way when the Son of
[55:52] God comes on the scene they men praise
[55:55] God when a son of God a man goes and
[55:57] shows towards the light who is Jesus
[55:59] Christ working through him darkness must
[56:01] give way amen praise God sickness must
[56:05] give way amen all these things must give
[56:08] way that have to do with darkness praise
[56:10] God
[56:11] now John we're going to read here a few
[56:15] scriptures just to kind of solidify this
[56:17] amen in 2nd Corinthians chapter 6 verse
[56:23] 14 because light and darkness cannot
[56:27] dwell together says be ye not unequally
[56:30] yoked together with unbelievers for what
[56:33] fellowship hath righteousness with
[56:35] unrighteousness and what communion hath
[56:37] light with darkness
[56:39] there's no communion with light in
[56:41] darkness John 1:5 says in the light
[56:44] shyness in darkness and the darkness
[56:47] comprehended it not Amen we read that
[56:50] scripture earlier in Ephesians 5:11 it
[56:53] says and have no fellowship with the
[56:55] unfruitful works of darkness but rather
[56:58] reprove them
[56:59] hey man praise God amen
[57:02] see because you're a light bear amen
[57:05] you're the one that's holding the torch
[57:07] Amen though the Lord Jesus Christ
[57:09] remember that that that that that story
[57:13] that brother Branham tells when they
[57:14] were in in a in a cave or something like
[57:17] that and and the little boy was scared
[57:19] because the light went out amen and they
[57:23] demand the man says don't worry or the
[57:25] person says don't worry there's a man
[57:26] here they can turn on the light
[57:28] amen he's on the scene st. you have
[57:30] nothing to worry about praise God
[57:32] hallelujah amen hmm light has to be
[57:37] separate from darkness first John one
[57:40] five and seven says this then is the
[57:43] message which we have heard of him and
[57:45] declare unto you that God is light and
[57:49] in him is no darkness at all if we say
[57:54] that we have fellowship with him and
[57:56] walk in darkness we lie and do not the
[57:59] truth in other words if you're a
[58:02] hypocrite I was bring it down straight
[58:06] but if we walk in the light as he is in
[58:08] the light we have fellowship one with
[58:11] another and the blood of Jesus Christ
[58:14] His Son cleanses us from all sin now
[58:16] because he is like and that light is
[58:18] dwelling of you in you and me that's the
[58:21] reason why we have fellowship one with
[58:22] another remember as the Adams and a a a
[58:26] and all these things are tied together
[58:28] by light we are also tied together by
[58:30] this light as well
[58:31] praise God amen Genesis 1:5 and now we
[58:36] just read the oh yes and God called the
[58:39] light day in the darkness he called
[58:40] night in the evening in the morning were
[58:42] the first day right
[58:45] first Thessalonians five five you're all
[58:48] children of light in the children of the
[58:51] day we are not of the night nor of
[58:53] darkness in last scripture here first
[58:56] Peter 2:9 but ye are a chosen generation
[58:58] a royal priesthood those are powerful
[59:03] words amen and holy nation you are the
[59:09] nation
[59:10] praise God a peculiar people
[59:13] so I the world doesn't understand you
[59:15] can't understand me
[59:16] you know this afternoon I was there's a
[59:20] cleaning lady that that cleans in our
[59:23] offices and she's a Christian she's from
[59:25] Cuba very interesting lady to talk to
[59:28] because she loves the Lord she's a
[59:30] Christian and she tells her testimony
[59:32] and she talks about how she came out of
[59:34] the communist mindset that they have
[59:37] down there in Cuba we're pretty much a
[59:38] lot of people are just atheists but now
[59:41] there's Christianity that that is there
[59:43] and so she said how God was dealing with
[59:46] her and just telling me all these things
[59:48] and she loves the Lord and I was kind of
[59:51] she saw she saw I was telling her
[59:54] because she knows that I'm a minister
[59:55] and I was telling her yeah I had to
[59:57] minister tonight and I was sort of
[59:59] sharing these things with her you know
[1:00:00] just a little bit you know and of course
[1:00:03] you know coming from a nominal
[1:00:05] background you know she just can't grasp
[1:00:08] everything Amen but she has a certain
[1:00:11] point of understanding she doesn't
[1:00:12] reject it though you know but she has a
[1:00:14] certain point of understanding amen and
[1:00:17] and so I'm just thankful that God just
[1:00:21] takes us amen and we've all started all
[1:00:24] at that point as well you know that's
[1:00:27] why I don't I don't look down on people
[1:00:29] who think II can't understand you know
[1:00:31] the things that you God has given you
[1:00:33] amen and given me to understand in this
[1:00:36] hour amen in the word the world doesn't
[1:00:39] talk about body changes much and in
[1:00:41] about Resurrection much and about they
[1:00:44] don't they don't know a lot about all
[1:00:46] these things that you and I know amen
[1:00:47] but that's what we don't look down on
[1:00:49] people that way for as God so what was I
[1:00:53] going on with that but you're a chosen
[1:00:54] generation a royal priesthood an holy
[1:00:56] nation a peculiar people that you should
[1:00:59] show forth the praises of him who hath
[1:01:01] called you out of darkness into the
[1:01:02] marvelous light hallelujah amen now
[1:01:06] listen to this this quote brother
[1:01:09] Branham brother Branham says here in the
[1:01:12] message do you now believe he this isn't
[1:01:16] a prayer line I believe it is and all of
[1:01:18] you even in there being prayer now I
[1:01:20] mean in silent prayer you can watch
[1:01:21] until I ask you to about our let's go
[1:01:23] down he says now but if there's any
[1:01:26] sickness may
[1:01:27] maybe you got something I don't know
[1:01:28] maybe you got cancer maybe you got some
[1:01:31] kind of female trouble I don't know what
[1:01:32] it is but whatever it is that's a
[1:01:35] disease which is the devil of the
[1:01:37] darkness amen that's right it's of
[1:01:40] darkness it's not of light
[1:01:43] sickness is of darkness to kill you God
[1:01:46] is like who brings life already man
[1:01:48] praise God amen
[1:01:51] so you don't have to accept the the
[1:01:53] works of the devil amen
[1:01:56] you don't have to accept sickness in
[1:01:57] your life you don't have to accept
[1:01:59] anything that the devil puts on you you
[1:02:01] don't have to accept that your children
[1:02:03] are not saved you don't have to accept
[1:02:05] that none of these things that come from
[1:02:07] darkness praise God because you are
[1:02:10] children of light and the Bible commands
[1:02:13] us to walk that way amen claim what's
[1:02:16] rightfully yours claim what's rightfully
[1:02:19] yours sings Amen Colossians 1 verse 12
[1:02:26] says given thanks unto the Father which
[1:02:28] hath made us meet to be partakers of the
[1:02:31] inheritance of the Saints in light who
[1:02:34] has delivered us from the power of
[1:02:36] darkness he has already bring we have
[1:02:40] already been delivered from the power of
[1:02:41] darkness and hath translated us into the
[1:02:44] kingdom of his dear son hallelujah it's
[1:02:47] already a work done work in the eyes of
[1:02:50] God thanks amen he's just wanting for
[1:02:53] you to catch up to that it's already
[1:02:57] he's already translated us they met a
[1:03:00] man he just wants you to believe that
[1:03:02] praise God and there's a kingdom of his
[1:03:04] dear son they meant see God wants you to
[1:03:07] see yourself the way he sees you amen he
[1:03:10] wants us to look at ourselves perfect
[1:03:13] the way he saw us before the foundation
[1:03:15] of the world
[1:03:16] hallelujah man if he could just look at
[1:03:20] the mirror of God's Word amen when you
[1:03:24] read this Bible I preached that message
[1:03:26] a while back about the mirror right when
[1:03:29] you read this Bible this Bible should be
[1:03:31] a mirror to you
[1:03:33] it shouldn't be something foggy it
[1:03:36] should be something that you cannot see
[1:03:38] clearly it should be a mirror you're
[1:03:40] joking at yourself right there
[1:03:42] everything that it's saying you're
[1:03:44] seeing you
[1:03:45] that is me from Genesis to Revelation no
[1:03:49] matter how you turn that mirror you're
[1:03:51] looking at yourself amen
[1:03:53] because this is you amen praise God
[1:03:55] hallelujah and if you can look at
[1:04:00] yourself in that manner Saints say in
[1:04:02] this powerless and what brother ways
[1:04:06] been bringing out lately if you can come
[1:04:09] to that to that but those we're bringing
[1:04:12] out that revival if you can just if you
[1:04:16] can if you can if you can realize that
[1:04:17] amen
[1:04:18] then then when death starts creeping up
[1:04:20] your arm you know you can shake it right
[1:04:23] off amen right just it right off a mint
[1:04:26] because it has no power over you if we
[1:04:30] could just have that reveal to us Saints
[1:04:33] it's in the word it's in the mirror all
[1:04:38] we just needed the revelation of it
[1:04:40] praise God and you know what brother
[1:04:43] does been bringing out late about about
[1:04:45] revival Amen I odd I was just having a
[1:04:49] revival in the car today
[1:04:50] a little revival that the world has
[1:04:53] knows nothing about but I'm there in the
[1:04:56] car and they probably thinking there's a
[1:04:59] man there with sunglasses on and he's
[1:05:01] just driving and he's just you know but
[1:05:04] I'm having a revival in my heart it's a
[1:05:07] quiet thing that the world knows nothing
[1:05:09] about that's what God is doing in his
[1:05:11] bride right now amen praise the Lord
[1:05:14] amen
[1:05:16] let's continue here real quick in the
[1:05:18] message three kinds of believers and we
[1:05:22] all know this story so the little boy
[1:05:24] one time down here in Kentucky raised
[1:05:25] way up in the mountains he had never
[1:05:27] been around where there was a
[1:05:29] lookingglass he had a little piece
[1:05:31] tacked up on a tree but he had never
[1:05:33] seen himself he come here to Louisville
[1:05:36] it was told and stay with his mother's
[1:05:39] sister and she lived in one of the nice
[1:05:40] homes an old-fashioned home when they
[1:05:42] went up into one of the bedrooms that
[1:05:44] had a door that had a mirror
[1:05:47] all up it all way up down the door so
[1:05:50] there was one of those long mirrors that
[1:05:52] you can place on the door and when the
[1:05:54] little fellow started to running through
[1:05:57] the house he stopped he said he's
[1:06:00] running and all of a sudden and that
[1:06:09] little image was moving right and then
[1:06:11] he would do that and the image was
[1:06:13] moving too and then he would do that
[1:06:15] yeah
[1:06:16] acting like spider-man yeah and the
[1:06:20] image was moving to everything that he
[1:06:22] was doing he'd stick his tongue out and
[1:06:25] it stick his tongue out at you so
[1:06:27] everything that he was doing that mirror
[1:06:30] what image was moving and all of a
[1:06:32] sudden he goes in screams mom that's me
[1:06:37] that's in the mirror that was exactly
[1:06:40] what he was seeing he was seeing himself
[1:06:41] in the name I wish the word of god was
[1:06:44] excited us that way all right well we
[1:06:49] come we come to church and weird weird
[1:06:51] you know we're tired and we're sleepy
[1:06:53] and understand we have life because I
[1:06:55] get tired I get sleepy too but God is
[1:06:58] trying to tell us something amen there's
[1:07:00] last day Saints right amen and I believe
[1:07:03] you we were not placed here for for just
[1:07:06] to be here all right man you and I have
[1:07:09] a specific purpose to be in this church
[1:07:11] to be in this community to be in this
[1:07:14] state be in this country for me to be
[1:07:21] married to my wife
[1:07:22] and me from one part of the world and
[1:07:26] and and she came from the other side of
[1:07:28] the world and and yet God brings a
[1:07:31] Filipino and a Colombian together to
[1:07:33] make filling bein children I never
[1:07:41] thought of that neither did my mom and
[1:07:43] dad neither did is my wife's mom and dad
[1:07:45] ever think of that that was God that did
[1:07:47] that now God has all these things they
[1:07:50] meant for you to receive his word amen
[1:07:54] it all boils down to you know it boils
[1:07:57] down to this that's why it doesn't
[1:07:59] matter what's going on in the pool
[1:08:01] because the only thing that God cares is
[1:08:03] to fulfill his word and his bride that's
[1:08:06] how he cares about let it happen
[1:08:09] whatever happened takes place I don't
[1:08:11] care it's all to fulfill this word it's
[1:08:16] all to fulfill this for amen
[1:08:18] praise God so little Johnny saw little
[1:08:20] Johnny that's what brother Brown says
[1:08:23] see and he scratched his head and little
[1:08:25] Johnny in the mirror scratched his head
[1:08:26] he laughed a little Johnny and the
[1:08:28] mirror laughed he jumped up then down
[1:08:30] amen praise God so we know so and this
[1:08:34] is like when when God when when Adam
[1:08:36] said this is now bone of my bone flesh
[1:08:39] of my flesh Eve was Adam manifested in
[1:08:44] broad form everything that Adam was a
[1:08:48] believe was right there and God remember
[1:08:52] God brought it to him God brought her
[1:08:54] Adam I mean brought her Eve God brought
[1:08:57] him right there careful I say that
[1:09:01] especially nowadays yeah oh my and he
[1:09:11] the father brought in brought Eve to
[1:09:14] Adam and she looked exactly just what he
[1:09:17] was what he was amen just exactly praise
[1:09:21] God just expressed in the female version
[1:09:23] but remember that female version was
[1:09:25] already dwelling within him amen praise
[1:09:28] the Lord John 16 says and in that day ye
[1:09:33] shall ask me nothing verily verily I say
[1:09:36] unto you whatsoever ye shall ask the
[1:09:39] Father in my name he will give it you
[1:09:41] praise God
[1:09:42] so whatever Eve wanted Adam was willing
[1:09:49] to do for her Amen or whatever whatever
[1:09:54] Eve desired her desire was his command
[1:09:57] Amen praise God hitherto have ye asked
[1:10:02] nothing in my name ask and ye shall
[1:10:04] receive that your joy may be full
[1:10:07] these things have I spoken unto you in
[1:10:10] Proverbs but the time cometh when I
[1:10:11] shall no more speak unto you in Proverbs
[1:10:14] but I shall show you plainly of the
[1:10:16] father I love this scripture because it
[1:10:20] says at that day ye shall ask in my name
[1:10:22] and I say not unto you that I will pray
[1:10:26] the Father for you in other words what
[1:10:28] is whatever you say he's not going to
[1:10:31] stand in the way of what you wanted was
[1:10:33] whatever you say or whatever you say
[1:10:37] amen for the father himself loveth you
[1:10:40] because ye have loved me and he believed
[1:10:45] and have believed that I came from God
[1:10:49] praise God so it's it's whatever you say
[1:10:52] Saints but again remember you're not
[1:10:55] going to say anything outside of his
[1:10:57] word therefore he could say that and he
[1:11:01] has that full confidence in you praise
[1:11:03] God now let's read this quote I thought
[1:11:11] it was really good other BAM says here
[1:11:14] and I saw new heavens and a new earth
[1:11:16] for the first heaven and the first earth
[1:11:18] was passed away and there was no more
[1:11:20] sea this is from Revelation revelation
[1:11:23] 21 I believe I John saw the holy city
[1:11:26] descending from God out of heaven as a
[1:11:28] bride adorned for her husband remember
[1:11:32] in this bride behold the tabernacle of
[1:11:35] God is with man and God shall dwell with
[1:11:37] them upon this pyramid-shaped City 1,500
[1:11:40] square miles and in the top of the city
[1:11:42] there will be a light amen oh that
[1:11:44] there'll be a light
[1:11:45] amen amen oh that City on mountains down
[1:11:48] he starts singing that song amen now
[1:11:51] let's keep let's keep reading the next
[1:11:52] part of it on top of Mount Zion will set
[1:11:57] the lamb and the city will need no light
[1:12:01] for the lamb is the light thereof the
[1:12:07] lamb is the life thereof amen pretty
[1:12:09] good and and above the lamb will be the
[1:12:12] father which is the logos but I thought
[1:12:15] Jesus Christ was the logos
[1:12:19] [Laughter]
[1:12:21] this both the same God the Great God the
[1:12:26] great light amen the eternal light that
[1:12:29] will shine just above the throne right
[1:12:32] and Jesus and Jesus will not be on his
[1:12:36] Father's throne he'll be on his throne
[1:12:39] amen and the father will hover over the
[1:12:42] son which the father and son will be one
[1:12:46] they are one and while they are listen
[1:12:50] to what brother Branham says here I
[1:12:51] thought this was ending and while they
[1:12:52] are yet speaking all answer before they
[1:12:56] can think I'm thinking for them that's
[1:13:00] right even I don't know it comes brother
[1:13:05] bread but that's the truth
[1:13:07] amen we have the same mindset I came out
[1:13:11] of the Father amen I came out of the
[1:13:13] logos you came out of the logos and
[1:13:15] whatever he says whatever he's thinking
[1:13:17] remember when Adam was naming the
[1:13:19] animals that's exactly lordose thinking
[1:13:22] Adam I can't I can't I can't deny that
[1:13:25] praise God amen the question is are you
[1:13:31] ready to see yourself the way God sees
[1:13:32] you amen let's not make this a routine
[1:13:37] let's not make Church reading the word
[1:13:40] studying as a routine amen because it's
[1:13:44] so easy for us to get into a routine and
[1:13:46] we get stuck in that routine and we
[1:13:49] think that that if that's that's just it
[1:13:51] that is the routine and that someday
[1:13:53] like brother Dale says the you know
[1:13:56] waiting for the bus to pull up the bus
[1:13:59] might come and you and you you stay
[1:14:01] you'll miss it we don't want to miss it
[1:14:04] since we don't want to miss it
[1:14:05] now now let's talk real quick I think
[1:14:08] let's talk about cook about this New
[1:14:10] Jerusalem Amen coming down from God as a
[1:14:12] bride the brother brother branham
[1:14:15] mentioned that here revelation 21:1
[1:14:19] says and I saw a new heaven we just read
[1:14:22] it but we worry and I saw a new heaven
[1:14:24] and new earth for the first heaven and
[1:14:25] the first Earth were passed away and
[1:14:27] there were no more see and I John saw
[1:14:31] the holy city New Jerusalem
[1:14:34] down from God out of heaven prepared as
[1:14:37] a bride adorned for her husband amen
[1:14:40] so as Eve came out of Adam Amen as a
[1:14:47] bride right as we the bride spiritually
[1:14:50] came out of Jesus Christ amen and here
[1:14:53] comes the bride again coming out of God
[1:14:55] again coming out of this eternal city
[1:14:58] praise God because it says in I John saw
[1:15:00] the holy city New Jerusalem coming down
[1:15:02] from God out of heaven prepared as a
[1:15:05] bride adorned for her husband
[1:15:08] amen amen
[1:15:11] you know Jesus said I come from God and
[1:15:13] I go back to God amen see the the bride
[1:15:18] it comes out of God goes back to God but
[1:15:21] then comes back down again with Jesus to
[1:15:23] reign eternally in the future home amen
[1:15:27] praise God now let's keep reading in
[1:15:29] revelation 21:3 and I heard a great
[1:15:31] voice out of heaven saying behold the
[1:15:34] tabernacle of God is with men and he
[1:15:37] will dwell with them and they shall be
[1:15:38] his people and God himself shall be with
[1:15:41] them and be their God praise the Lord
[1:15:44] Amen hallelujah so that bride a man that
[1:15:52] life as Jesus Christ is the light
[1:15:56] thereof amen will be the light with him
[1:15:58] just as much
[1:15:59] amen in that eternal city praise God now
[1:16:02] let's read this next quote amen I think
[1:16:05] I'm making good time we're almost done
[1:16:08] but he's got to be a good one to end
[1:16:15] with brother Branham says hear questions
[1:16:17] and answers and John said I saw a new
[1:16:20] heaven and a new earth for the first
[1:16:21] heaven and the first Earth were passed
[1:16:23] away and there was no more sea and I
[1:16:26] John saw the holy city the New Jerusalem
[1:16:28] descending from God out of heaven
[1:16:29] prepared as a bride adorned for her
[1:16:31] husband there you are there he said the
[1:16:34] wife the Lamb and the bride will be
[1:16:36] there forever there'll be a new earth
[1:16:39] millions of millions of square miles of
[1:16:41] Mother City and he keeps talking he's
[1:16:43] talking about the city the details of
[1:16:44] the city let's go and says
[1:16:46] there's the 20 and for elders there's
[1:16:49] the bride
[1:16:50] there's the forty and four thousand the
[1:16:53] temple eunuchs
[1:16:54] oh brother were going somewhere things
[1:16:57] lay ahead for us amen
[1:17:00] the for the twenty and for elders the
[1:17:03] 144,000 eunuchs the bride setting with
[1:17:07] Christ my you talk my home sweet home
[1:17:09] amen visca it's not just you're sitting
[1:17:13] on the throne with him amen you're
[1:17:15] sitting in his domain with him amen to
[1:17:18] think that I have the privilege of going
[1:17:20] there and you have the privilege of
[1:17:23] going there and why would you choose to
[1:17:25] walk in this darkness and see no life
[1:17:27] and die and go into chaos and become
[1:17:30] nothing why would you want that right
[1:17:34] for when light takes a supreme authority
[1:17:37] there's no place for darkness go find
[1:17:41] where the darkness went when light comes
[1:17:44] amen what happened to the darkness amen
[1:17:47] when we open that door they had to give
[1:17:49] way right for when light takes the
[1:17:53] supreme authority there's no place for
[1:17:54] Darkness go find where the darkness went
[1:17:56] when the light comes that's the way it
[1:17:57] is when all things are turned back to
[1:17:59] God that had darkness had a beginning so
[1:18:04] even though darkness was there with a
[1:18:06] Bible in Genesis 1 it says there was
[1:18:07] darkness but it had a beginning right in
[1:18:11] the beginning right darkness had to
[1:18:14] begin and darkness has an end
[1:18:16] praise God light never had a beginning
[1:18:19] because God like God is like amen
[1:18:22] light never had a beginning or it never
[1:18:25] has an end therefore you have no
[1:18:27] beginning and you have no end amen
[1:18:30] God never had a beginning or never has
[1:18:32] an end amen so someday the whole d-bots
[1:18:36] world with all of its sin and its beauty
[1:18:39] so called and all of its fantasticks
[1:18:42] and sensations and all of its glamour
[1:18:44] and everything will fade out into
[1:18:46] nothing and it will be no more because
[1:18:48] remember God is going to burn all this
[1:18:50] sin sin off of this earth everything
[1:18:53] that we see here on this earth all these
[1:18:55] all these uh all these things that there
[1:18:58] is Satan's domain
[1:19:00] and this is Satan's Kingdom all these
[1:19:03] are civilizations and all these things
[1:19:06] amen that's not what God had in his mind
[1:19:08] amen
[1:19:09] but we know that God had a plan they
[1:19:12] meant it'll be no more no more thought
[1:19:14] of it said even it won't even come into
[1:19:17] the remembrance anymore
[1:19:19] praise God hallelujah so so who is the
[1:19:23] bride it's God Himself is the light
[1:19:29] right God Himself manifested you are his
[1:19:34] bride sing you are his light you are the
[1:19:40] light of the world Jesus saying you're
[1:19:43] more than what you think that what Satan
[1:19:45] would want you to think that you are
[1:19:47] you're not just a Christian lowly barely
[1:19:51] making it day-to-day yes
[1:19:54] if I could just get out of bed oh my
[1:20:00] brother dick you brother dicks that's
[1:20:03] you're not destined for that for
[1:20:05] eternity your ears that's not a disease
[1:20:11] because I get it too and I'm 30 I'm only
[1:20:16] 36
[1:20:24] and now ma'am I don't want to make some
[1:20:26] of you jealous no no that but Saint but
[1:20:33] see I'm not in the age that I'm supposed
[1:20:35] to be when we get young again we're
[1:20:37] young again
[1:20:38] so I'm passed you know I think we were
[1:20:41] talking about the Jo the other day I was

[1:21:09] all these things that we see now they're
[1:21:11] not here to stay
[1:21:13] God's gonna destroy it but make it all
[1:21:17] new again him and everything that he
[1:21:19] thought of from the beginning amen it's
[1:21:21] going to be restored amen and it has
[1:21:24] started with you and I Amen that's why
[1:21:27] the Bible says that the creation is
[1:21:30] groaning and travailing for the
[1:21:31] manifestation of the sons of God amen so
[1:21:34] when God saw the light he saw himself he
[1:21:38] got excited when God saw Jesus Christ he
[1:21:41] got excited when he saw you he got
[1:21:43] excited
[1:21:44] amen excites him I hope you just excited
[1:21:47] about it as he is he's thrilled to death
[1:21:50] that he had the privilege to reveal his
[1:21:53] word to a people that come out of him
[1:21:56] amen that they will think exactly like
