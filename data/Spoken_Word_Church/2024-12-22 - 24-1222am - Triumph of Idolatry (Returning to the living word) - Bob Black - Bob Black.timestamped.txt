[25:35] and for the King has left his

[25:42] tonight
[25:44] [Music]
[26:00] now the birth of Jesus Christ was on
[26:02] this wise when his mother Mary was
[26:04] espoused to Joseph before they came
[26:06] together she was found with child of the
[26:07] Holy
[26:08] Ghost then Joseph her husband being a
[26:12] just man and not willing to make her a
[26:13] public example was minded to put her
[26:16] away privy but while he thought on these
[26:18] things behold the angel of the Lord
[26:20] appeared unto him in a dream saying
[26:22] Joseph thou son of David fear not to
[26:24] take unto thee Mary thy wife for that
[26:26] which is conceived in her is of the the
[26:28] Holy Ghost and she shall bring forth a
[26:31] son and thou shalt call his name Jesus
[26:33] and he shall deliver his people from
[26:35] their sins now all this was done that it
[26:37] might be fulfilled which was spoken of
[26:39] the Lord by the prophet saying Behold a
[26:42] virgin shall be with child and shall
[26:44] bring forth the son and they shall call
[26:46] his name Emanuel which being interpreted
[26:48] is god with us then Joseph being raised
[26:51] from sleep did as the angel of the Lord
[26:52] had bided him and took unto him his wife
[26:56] and he knew her not until she brought
[26:57] forth with her firstborn son and he
[26:59] called his name
[27:03] Jesus Oh Bethlehem would you have missed

[27:40] sleeping and the Word was made flesh and
[27:43] dwelt among us and we beheld his glory
[27:45] the glory as of the only begotten of the
[27:47] father full of grace and
[27:51] truth Mary Shivers in the cold trying to
[27:56] keep the savior
[28:03] born born among the
[28:07] animals wrapped in dirty rags but there
[28:11] was no room for him and the world he
[28:15] came to
[28:17] save oh Bethlehem what you have missed
[28:22] While You Were
[28:23] Sleeping for God became a man and
[28:27] stepped into your world
[28:31] today oh Bethlehem you will go down in
[28:36] history as a city with no room for its
[28:42] king while you were
[28:49] sleeping while you were
[28:54] sleeping now when Jesus was born in
[28:57] Judea of in in the days of Herod the
[28:59] king behold there came wise men from the
[29:01] East to Jerusalem saying where is he
[29:03] that is born King of the Jews for we
[29:05] have seen his star in the east and are
[29:07] come to worship
[29:11] him oh little town of

[30:47] sleeping and it came to pass in those
[30:49] days that there went out a decree from
[30:52] Caesar Augustus that all the world
[30:53] should be taxed and this taxing was
[30:56] first made when serenius was governor of
[30:58] Syria and all went to be taxed everyone
[31:01] into his own City and Joseph also went
[31:04] up From Galilee out of the city of
[31:06] Nazareth into Judea under the city of
[31:09] David which is called Bethlehem because
[31:11] he was of the house and lineage of David
[31:14] to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife
[31:16] being great with
[31:18] child and so it was that while they were
[31:20] there the days were accomplished that
[31:22] she should be delivered and she brought
[31:24] forth her firstborn son wrapped him in
[31:26] swaddling clothes and laid him in a
[31:29] Manger because there was no room for
[31:31] them in the
[31:33] end and there were in the same country
[31:36] shepherds abiding in the field keeping
[31:38] watch over their flock by night and lo
[31:41] the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and
[31:43] the glory of the Lord Shone around them
[31:45] and they were sore afraid and the angel
[31:48] said unto them fear not for behold I
[31:50] bring you good tidings of great joy

[32:12] multitude of the Heavenly Host praising
[32:14] God and saying glory to God in the
[32:16] highest and on Earth Good Will toward
[32:18] men and it came to pass as the Angels
[32:21] were gone away from them into heaven the
[32:24] Shepherds said one to another let us go
[32:27] even unto Beth lehem and see these
[32:28] things which are come to pass which the
[32:31] Lord hath made known unto us and they
[32:34] came with haste and found Mary and
[32:35] Joseph and the Babe lying in a
[32:38] manger and when they had seen it they
[32:40] made known abroad the saying which was
[32:42] told them concerning this child and all
[32:45] that heard it wondered at those things
[32:47] which were told by the Shepherds but
[32:50] Mary kept all these things and pondered
[32:52] them in her heart and the Shepherds
[32:55] returned glorifying and praising God for
[32:57] all the things things that they had
[32:58] heard and seen as it was told unto

[49:02] enough to put on a play like that and
[49:04] inspired to present things in that way
[49:07] Lord Jesus I thank you Lord Jesus that
[49:10] we come together today not not to
[49:12] celebrate some kind of a man-made thing

[49:43] that you can come and live in us and
[49:45] change
[49:46] us that's what this time and this season
[49:48] is really about I pray God that you'll
[49:50] bless this service today we ask in your
[49:53] name and the word as we read it amen
[49:57] I want to read um from Jeremiah chapter
[49:59] 7 this morning and Acts chapter
[50:03] 7 and I sure I sure enjoyed
[50:07] that thank
[50:12] you and take a little title uh it's kind
[50:15] of a long title triumph over idolity
[50:18] return to the Living
[50:20] Word now first we'll read from Jeremiah
[50:22] chapter 7 verses 10-1 17
[50:27] and uh kind of a long reading this
[50:28] morning U but we'll read from there and
[50:31] then we'll go to Acts chapter
[50:33] 7 so jeriah chapter 7 and maybe just to
[50:36] to think about what Jeremiah he's he's
[50:39] he's rebuking the people who have uh
[50:42] well well in the verse in verse 10 here
[50:45] he says and come and stand before me in
[50:47] this house which is called by my name
[50:49] and say we are delivered to do all these
[50:51] Abominations so right away you can see
[50:53] he's rebuking Israel for you know they
[50:55] they come to to the Tabernacle of the
[50:57] Lord they'll come to the house and and
[51:00] and they think well we we're delivered
[51:02] of uh you know that we're standing in
[51:04] the house of God and we're delivered but
[51:07] yet see Jeremiah he's scolding them
[51:10] because they're actually looking at the
[51:12] wrong thing despite the fact that
[51:13] they're in the house of God and they're
[51:15] they're you know worshiping and things
[51:17] but he he said is this house which is
[51:19] called by my name become a den of
[51:20] robbers in your eyes and this is a
[51:22] scripture that Jesus quoted when he went
[51:23] into the temple and and platted the
[51:26] ropes and begin to uh because he saw
[51:29] that they had made made the house of God
[51:31] something that it shouldn't be and he
[51:32] said behold even I have seen it sayith
[51:35] the Lord but go ye now unto my place
[51:38] which was in Shiloh where I set my name
[51:40] at the first Shiloh is where they when
[51:42] they when they come out of Egypt into
[51:43] the prom into the promised land through
[51:45] the through the Wilderness into the
[51:46] promised land they came to Shiloh and
[51:48] they put the T they started worshiping
[51:49] in Shiloh but after a while they got
[51:52] away from God and God allowed the
[51:53] Philistines to come in and just destroy
[51:55] direct the place so he's saying come now
[51:58] come you now into my place which was in
[51:59] Shiloh where I set my name at the first
[52:02] and see what I did to it for the
[52:03] wickedness of My People Israel and now
[52:06] because you have done all these works
[52:07] sayith the Lord and I spake unto you
[52:09] rising up early and speaking but ye
[52:11] heard not and I called you but ye answer
[52:13] not therefore will I do under this house
[52:15] which is called by my name wherein you
[52:17] trust and under the place which I gave
[52:19] to you and to your fathers as I have
[52:21] done to Shiloh and I will cast you out
[52:23] of my sight as I have cast out all your
[52:25] brethren even the whole sea seed of
[52:26] Ephraim therefore pray not thou for this
[52:29] people neither lift up cry nor prayer
[52:31] for them neither make intercession to me
[52:33] for I will not hear thee see us thou not
[52:35] what they do in the cities of Judah and
[52:37] in the streets of Jerusalem the children
[52:40] the people the people of Israel they
[52:42] were worshiping in the Tabernacle he
[52:44] said they they're Gathering wood the
[52:46] fathers Kindle Fire the women need their
[52:48] dough to make cakes to the Queen of
[52:51] Heaven and to pour out drink offerings
[52:54] unto other gods that they may provoke me
[52:56] to anger now now you know what brother
[52:59] random is getting at when he's preaching
[53:00] this and that what Jeremiah is is he's
[53:02] trying to to expose how sometimes you
[53:05] can you can go to church and you can be
[53:07] doing things or you know like look at
[53:09] the today the the way the society is
[53:11] today going going to church and doing
[53:14] going through the motions and everything
[53:15] but actually looking at the wrong thing
[53:18] this is a strange Christmas message
[53:21] maybe hang on in Acts chapter 7 if we'll
[53:25] go over there in Acts chap 7 verse
[53:28] 44 uh uh this this is actually uh Steven
[53:32] he's defending himself because they're
[53:34] accusing him of blasphemy they're saying
[53:36] that when they that the the Jews of that
[53:38] day began to accuse Stephen of of um of
[53:42] of speaking against the Tabernacle and
[53:44] so Stevens begins to tell them you know
[53:46] you're looking at that Tabernacle at
[53:48] that place where you worship when
[53:49] actually God is now he's actually
[53:51] dwelling in in people so you're looking
[53:54] at a building for your identification
[53:56] you're looking at something something
[53:58] other and so he's said our fathers had
[53:59] the Tabernacle of w witness in the
[54:01] wilderness as he had appointed speaking
[54:03] unto Moses that he should make it
[54:05] according to the fashion that he had
[54:06] seen which also our fathers that came
[54:09] after brought in with Jesus into the
[54:11] possession of the Gentiles whom God dve
[54:12] out before the face of our fathers unto
[54:14] the days of of David who found favor
[54:18] before God and desired to find a
[54:20] tabernacle for the god of Jacob but
[54:23] Solomon built him in house how be it the
[54:25] most high dwelt not in temples made with
[54:27] hands as sayith the prophet Heaven is my
[54:30] throne and Earth is my foot stol what
[54:33] house will you be build me sayith the
[54:34] Lord or what is the place of my rest
[54:37] hath not my hand made all these things
[54:39] you may be seated the Lord at his
[54:41] Blessing to the reading of the
[54:44] word now this was this was taken from a
[54:47] Christmas message that brother brandham
[54:48] preached uh back in I think it was 1961
[54:52] Christianity versus idolatry uh
[54:55] comparing Christian and idolatry and and
[54:58] and you know really Christmas Christmas
[55:00] is a is a strange time that it's like
[55:03] every every time people wrestle with
[55:05] with Christmas because it's got all you
[55:07] know you gather around with your family
[55:09] and you know we're about to be
[55:10] grandparents and we we we sure are ready
[55:14] to give some gifts and have have a good
[55:16] old time with our with with our first
[55:18] grandbaby and and as many as to come and
[55:21] and so boy as far as that goes I really
[55:24] enjoy I really enjoy Christmas you know
[55:26] we talk about having a a little a little
[55:28] train go around and and and and all the
[55:31] the little presents and things and don't
[55:33] you just love when you give a gift to
[55:35] somebody whether it's a birthday present
[55:37] or an anniversary present or just
[55:39] something you got for your wife or your
[55:40] husband uh and and maybe uh even at
[55:43] Christmas and and you see them open up
[55:45] that gift and they they you know it
[55:47] makes them happy and you know but on the
[55:49] other side of the coin though is that
[55:51] all these elements of Christmas are
[55:53] actually rooted in Pagan mythology and
[55:56] things and they've got all these things
[55:57] that you know Santa Claus Santa Claus is
[56:00] is is a lie now so you know you go back
[56:03] and really when brother randam would
[56:04] preach these things he say he say we're
[56:07] concerned about the children on
[56:09] Christmas he said I thought I had a
[56:11] Christmas message for the church but I
[56:13] had such a feeling for them little now
[56:14] look how he's framing Christmas he's he
[56:17] want he loves little kids you know you
[56:19] you want little kids are going to go to
[56:21] school and everybody else is getting a
[56:22] present and and and uh you know talking
[56:25] about things and then they're wondering
[56:26] why they don't get a present you know if
[56:28] you're looking at if you're framing up
[56:30] the the holiday like that so he's
[56:32] thinking about the kids he said I must
[56:34] say if I'd be here then the little
[56:36] fellas would probably many of them far
[56:38] away would miss their Christmas and
[56:40] things so it would be kind of hard on
[56:42] those little fellas and he said we
[56:44] people now now so he's he he wants to do
[56:47] for the little children now aren't you
[56:49] glad that we've got we've got the the
[56:51] the message framed up like that so with
[56:54] balance so that we're not too much on
[56:56] this this side too much on that side but
[56:57] we can look you know get around with
[57:00] your family at Christmas time and drink
[57:02] some hot chocolate with some a little
[57:04] peppermint stick in it but and and you
[57:06] can you don't have to worship Santa
[57:08] Claus or or have all that Santa Claus
[57:10] nonsense that lie but you can still get
[57:12] around with your family next to the
[57:13] crackling fire and think about what God
[57:16] has done for you and what Christmas is
[57:18] really about is it's not it's not uh the
[57:21] pagan holiday all the the the the the
[57:23] the time of the sun god of December 25th
[57:26] and all that stuff but it's really you
[57:28] know our Focus the meaning of it is that
[57:31] it's all about Jesus Christ now now
[57:34] that's that's why you know we we we
[57:36] don't teach our children that when you
[57:39] come to church we're preaching the truth
[57:41] it's all about the truth the Bible says
[57:44] that we've got to Worship in spirit and
[57:45] truth so that's why we don't tell our
[57:47] children lies about Santa Claus CU you
[57:50] imagine I I went to school with so many
[57:52] people growing up and you know they they
[57:54] come home and their parents would play
[57:55] this prank on them where they they
[57:57] actually get up on the roof with a
[57:59] clippity clop noises and they I heard it
[58:03] I heard the reindeer and and and do all
[58:06] these elaborate things and then and then
[58:08] later on you'd want you know all the
[58:10] other other kids there ain't no Santa
[58:12] Claus and and then they become a
[58:14] laughing stop and then then as time goes
[58:17] on that it it it come time for them to
[58:19] realize that it all was a lie and then
[58:22] now they got to wrestle with well why
[58:25] did my mama and daddy make me look like
[58:27] a fool why did my mama and daddy and
[58:30] then see you got that dilemma you got
[58:31] that thing you got to overcome now now
[58:34] they're going to tell you about Jesus
[58:35] Christ and now you got that big old
[58:38] Blocker in your head now well well if if
[58:41] you lied to me about this then what
[58:44] about that now now that's not just a
[58:47] lesson for Santa Claus though that's a
[58:49] lesson for everything see we'll put that
[58:51] over in a little special box and we then
[58:53] we'll we like well I can feel about this
[58:55] over here and I and FIB about that but
[58:57] you know God wants Christians to be to
[59:00] be truthful in every aspect of Our Lives
[59:04] he don't want a husband to hide stuff
[59:06] from his wife from looking on her his
[59:08] phone or hide that secret bank account
[59:11] or hide this or that but you be truthful
[59:13] be truthful at everything that you do
[59:16] cuz you know Christians Christians don't
[59:18] tell lies and Lyon let me just drop this
[59:22] over here Lyon stems from from and leads
[59:26] to broken relationships and mistrust and
[59:29] further sin and that's why Proverbs 12
[59:31] says the Lord detests lying lips but he
[59:34] Delights in people who are
[59:36] trustworthy so you know you start
[59:39] talking about lying if you were to go to
[59:40] get in a Bible study you you get into
[59:42] all that territory of moral dilemas and
[59:44] things is it would it be all right to
[59:46] tell a little phib if you're if you're
[59:48] like Rahab on the roof and she's lying
[59:50] and she's told the well told the people
[59:52] looking for the spies well I don't know
[59:54] where they are and all those kind of
[59:55] things but but this but the the the
[59:57] sense of the thing the ESS the the the
[59:59] really the bottom line is is God is a
[1:00:02] god of Truth and if you're going to deal
[1:00:04] with one another in relationships and
[1:00:06] deal with one another in things always
[1:00:08] seek to tell the truth tell the truth no
[1:00:11] matter what because God is a god of
[1:00:13] Truth Now now see because Santa Claus
[1:00:16] Santa Claus Is A
[1:00:17] Lie brother Brown would say you can give
[1:00:20] gifts sing songs Fellowship around the
[1:00:22] real meaning without involving Santa
[1:00:25] Claus the meaning is we were given the
[1:00:27] greatest gift the meaning of Christmas
[1:00:29] is we were given the greatest gift that
[1:00:31] could ever be given and Christmas has
[1:00:33] lost its
[1:00:35] meaning what's the meaning Christmas is
[1:00:38] no more a
[1:00:39] worship we we went up to uh like brother
[1:00:42] William was preaching on a few weeks ago
[1:00:44] we went up to Dela and they got their
[1:00:46] big Christmas thing going on and and
[1:00:48] everybody's out there drinking and and
[1:00:51] doing you know doing the worldly things
[1:00:53] and it's like you you you all the
[1:00:55] commercial ISM and everything and it
[1:00:57] seems like just the world has just
[1:00:58] forgotten about what the real meaning is
[1:01:00] they're hustling and bustling trying to
[1:01:02] find gifts and things at this time of
[1:01:04] year trying to get gifts trying to get
[1:01:06] that poker game trying to get that uh
[1:01:08] that whiskey that they're going to give
[1:01:09] for a gift all those things but they
[1:01:11] they've lost the real meaning of what
[1:01:12] Christmas is and to them it's just
[1:01:14] become a big celebration drinking
[1:01:16] gambling carousing just pegging to the
[1:01:19] Limit but now on the other side the
[1:01:22] little children just don't understand
[1:01:23] that he said they see little fellas on
[1:01:26] Christmas night getting Christmas
[1:01:27] presents and things like that they don't
[1:01:29] understand it they're too little and
[1:01:31] we've got to remember them that they
[1:01:33] have things in common we got to bring
[1:01:36] oursel down to remember them them little
[1:01:40] fellas oh if we could if we could humble
[1:01:43] oursel down to remember that they're
[1:01:45] little they're just little kids and they
[1:01:46] don't know little kids he said you have
[1:01:49] to let them have something but always be
[1:01:52] sure of this tell them there is no such
[1:01:55] a thing as Santa Claus cuz one of these
[1:01:58] days they'll walk up and say what about
[1:02:00] Jesus then see so tell them the truth
[1:02:03] amen be honest with
[1:02:06] everybody and Christmas itself Christmas
[1:02:09] itself is a myth it it's nothing real
[1:02:12] about Christmas Christmas wasn't even
[1:02:15] mentioned in the Bible they never
[1:02:16] worshiped the birthday of Christ it
[1:02:18] wasn't no such a thing that's a Roman
[1:02:20] Catholic dogma and not a Christian
[1:02:22] teaching no scripture for it nowhere in
[1:02:24] the Bible and for the first UND years
[1:02:27] after the Bible nothing of it it's just
[1:02:29] a myth Santa Claus commercial everything
[1:02:32] the whole thing is wound up into a big
[1:02:35] conglomeration now that's why that's why
[1:02:37] Christmas this time has become such a
[1:02:38] confusion because on the one side it's
[1:02:40] just a me everything about it is fake
[1:02:42] everything everything the whole history
[1:02:44] of Christmas is not tied to Christianity
[1:02:46] at all but on the other side remember
[1:02:49] the little children remember them and
[1:02:51] and treat them right and and think about
[1:02:53] how they're going to react you know that
[1:02:55] what they they want a little something
[1:02:57] and and so forth and so on and that's
[1:02:59] why brother Brandon when he's preaching
[1:03:00] this sermon he said maybe I better he
[1:03:02] said don't even just don't even send the
[1:03:04] tape out because it's going to confuse
[1:03:06] everybody he said maybe I better censor
[1:03:09] this whole thing just not send it out
[1:03:10] May because it's pretty rude these tapes
[1:03:12] are not for sale they can be passed
[1:03:14] around through the church or so forth
[1:03:16] because it'll cause confusion as sure as
[1:03:18] the world ceas to just hold it till we
[1:03:21] get it fixed different see there's a
[1:03:23] truth there's a truth to Christ's birth
[1:03:26] but a whole lot of elements of Christmas
[1:03:27] are a blend of paganism and mythology
[1:03:30] and
[1:03:31] idolatry idolatry that attracts from
[1:03:33] True Christian faith idolatry idolatry
[1:03:37] is when you start elevating something
[1:03:39] above the word of God and you start
[1:03:41] looking at that instead of what the real
[1:03:43] meaning Isen you take this Santa Claus
[1:03:45] figure that that uh that you know the
[1:03:47] story of the St Nick where they he gave
[1:03:49] the eggs to the to the girls that didn't
[1:03:51] have a DIY and and and that blossomed on
[1:03:54] down through time into the story of of
[1:03:56] of a man that lives at the North Pole
[1:03:58] and he's got a little a little a little
[1:04:00] pole with a peppermint stripe around it
[1:04:02] and all these all these thing reindeer
[1:04:04] that come on top of your house and
[1:04:06] people will tell that to their children
[1:04:08] for truth and and and the same thing on
[1:04:11] the flip side what we're really getting
[1:04:13] to is that that things that are not true
[1:04:15] are preached to people and and they look
[1:04:18] at that and and expect to get something
[1:04:20] from God when it it's the same thing
[1:04:22] idolatry being lifted up above the word
[1:04:24] of God and they look to that instead of
[1:04:27] the word of God expecting to get
[1:04:28] something Christmas ain't about Santa
[1:04:30] Claus or money or stuff but it's about
[1:04:32] Jesus Christ what does December 25th got
[1:04:36] to do with Jesus's birthday what does
[1:04:38] Santa Claus got to do with Christianity
[1:04:40] and the North Pole and Rain deer and all
[1:04:42] giving all them things if
[1:04:45] Christmas Christmas has just become a
[1:04:48] brother like brother R said drinking
[1:04:49] gambling carousing just Pagan Pagan to
[1:04:53] the Limit
[1:04:56] I hope I hope y'all like that kind of
[1:04:57] preaching this
[1:04:59] morning that's a little bit different
[1:05:01] maybe for a Christmas message but again
[1:05:04] it goes back to truth we want we want
[1:05:06] the truth I want to know about things
[1:05:09] and you know you can have you look at
[1:05:10] this thing and and and and and while
[1:05:12] we've got the little train going around
[1:05:14] the tree and and all those things we can
[1:05:17] look at it with true understanding that
[1:05:18] we ain't we ain't worshiping Santa Claus
[1:05:20] and we ain't telling our kids about
[1:05:22] Santa Claus and we're not buying all
[1:05:24] these all these fake gift it's not just
[1:05:27] about commercialism where we're sit
[1:05:29] around with our family expecting to get
[1:05:32] a gift how many gifts am I going to get
[1:05:35] you know we we joke about how when we
[1:05:36] were kids we would sit around looking
[1:05:38] over at that Christmas tree and we would
[1:05:40] think oh Lord please don't let the
[1:05:42] Rapture come before I get
[1:05:44] my and now and and and now as we get
[1:05:49] older have we grown out of that are we
[1:05:50] still expecting to get all this all this
[1:05:53] pile of loot at Christmas or is it
[1:05:55] really is our heart really turn back to
[1:05:57] what it really is about about Jesus
[1:06:00] Christ and because now really any
[1:06:02] devotion any devotion or worship or
[1:06:05] priority that's placed above God is
[1:06:09] idolatry anything that you put above God
[1:06:13] is
[1:06:14] idolatry and brother Brandon would say
[1:06:16] there's a little wrote about idolatry
[1:06:18] there's not many books to explain
[1:06:20] idolatry what is idolatry and yet the
[1:06:23] world's full of it see when we think
[1:06:25] about idolatry we think of something
[1:06:27] over there over in India over there back
[1:06:29] in the historical days where they would
[1:06:31] have an idol but to think now that
[1:06:34] idolatry can actually be right here
[1:06:36] where where you've you've forgotten so
[1:06:38] much about God until you you've actually
[1:06:40] replaced god with with scrolling on your
[1:06:42] phone all day or or or or or or or just
[1:06:46] tapping into movies and things where
[1:06:48] instead of letting the word of God
[1:06:49] change your thinking you're letting the
[1:06:51] movies change your thinking to where the
[1:06:53] movies today have changed Society
[1:06:55] thinking until they're they actually
[1:06:57] don't know whether they're a boy or a
[1:06:58] girl or whether they're this or that and
[1:07:00] it's actually changed their thinking cuz
[1:07:02] they tapped into that instead of the
[1:07:04] word of God and they elevated that up to
[1:07:06] where it's it's it's a it's an idolatry
[1:07:09] what's what's the definition of idolatry
[1:07:11] he said some some worship movie stars
[1:07:13] for Idols some worship money for idols
[1:07:15] and some worship television stars as
[1:07:17] Idols but all that you put before God is
[1:07:20] an idol let it be whatever it be I think
[1:07:24] about when Moses when Moses went up into
[1:07:27] the mountain to bring down what the
[1:07:29] essentially the Seven Seals the The Ten
[1:07:31] Commandments back down to the children
[1:07:33] of Israel but it took too long and they
[1:07:35] got to wait and where's Moses at and
[1:07:37] instead of waiting for the word of God
[1:07:39] to come down then they Aaron and
[1:07:41] everybody got busy collecting all the
[1:07:43] gold and they made a golden idol how how
[1:07:46] how do they know to make it to look like
[1:07:48] a calf that's a good question to think
[1:07:50] about why do they make it look like a
[1:07:52] cat why do they fashion it that way but
[1:07:54] they instead instead of waiting for the
[1:07:56] word of God they elevated their own
[1:07:58] ideas and their own thoughts about what
[1:08:00] God would really be and they begin to
[1:08:02] worship that Idol that they created and
[1:08:05] any Act of idolatry brings the
[1:08:07] individual into spiritual alignment with
[1:08:09] forces opposed to God now now you think
[1:08:12] but you think about that that idolatry
[1:08:14] sitting there and watching your TV
[1:08:16] watching your love shows your romance
[1:08:18] movies it actually will begin to change
[1:08:21] your mind it change you because it
[1:08:23] begins to align you with something that
[1:08:25] different from what the word of God says
[1:08:27] and you start thinking well they're
[1:08:28] doing it on that TV show so it must be
[1:08:31] all right for me and my family and you
[1:08:33] you same thing with comic books you and
[1:08:36] anything you know you you start aligning
[1:08:38] yourself with that thing that anime that
[1:08:41] that so many people get caught up with
[1:08:42] when you start watching those people
[1:08:44] doing uh little girls having girlfriends
[1:08:48] and all that stuff and all that anime
[1:08:49] nonsense and you start aligning yourself
[1:08:52] with with that message and it begins to
[1:08:55] have an effect on your life so anything
[1:08:58] that replaces or detracts from our
[1:09:00] devotion to God can become an idol and
[1:09:03] open the door up to demonic influence
[1:09:06] now to think though that brother Brandon
[1:09:07] would say that idolatry is the same
[1:09:09] today as it has always been and studying
[1:09:13] idolatry mythology Greek mythology and
[1:09:15] Roman mythology it brings me back to see
[1:09:17] whether if idolatry remains as it was at
[1:09:19] the beginning today in travel seeing
[1:09:21] idolatry and then seeing the way it
[1:09:23] began I see that it hasn't chain now
[1:09:25] that's something to think about now now
[1:09:28] now we we're not just sitting around
[1:09:29] with a stick you know next to a fire and
[1:09:31] and and and and you know conking one
[1:09:33] another over the head and worshiping
[1:09:35] idols and but but but actually idolatry
[1:09:38] is so sneaky that it can sneak in right
[1:09:40] there in modern society and and what a
[1:09:43] Christmas message what a Christmas
[1:09:46] message to where the world I I I I was
[1:09:48] watching on uh you know you see those
[1:09:51] ads they'll pop up about what what local
[1:09:53] area churches are doing and things and I
[1:09:55] saw one where they they had somebody
[1:09:57] come down from the ceiling dressed in a
[1:09:59] looked like lights all over this woman's
[1:10:02] dress and they had a bunch of screens up
[1:10:05] behind her and all these this huge
[1:10:07] Coliseum looking place and and they they
[1:10:10] they they believe that they're sitting
[1:10:11] there getting something from God when
[1:10:14] the word of God is not being preached
[1:10:15] and they come out there dress like a
[1:10:17] bunch of pagans bobbed hair and and and
[1:10:20] dressed like the world and and and there
[1:10:22] with their coffee and all those kind of
[1:10:24] things coming to church just for coffee
[1:10:26] and not for the word of God but all
[1:10:28] those thing and and it becomes idolatry
[1:10:31] they're there for a Christmas show but a
[1:10:33] Christmas show has replaced the word of
[1:10:35] God it's repl and you know brother Brown
[1:10:38] want to go back and he began to talk
[1:10:39] about the Indian firew Walkers firew
[1:10:42] walkers in India and Farmers confessing
[1:10:45] sins to priest and Greek and Roman Idol
[1:10:48] worshippers and how they they really
[1:10:50] were sincere in what they were trying to
[1:10:52] do in the same way that many today are
[1:10:55] sincere about what they're trying to do
[1:10:57] they sit sincerely in churches all
[1:10:59] around the world and they're sincerely
[1:11:01] believing that they're coming to worship
[1:11:04] a God but they don't know the god of the
[1:11:06] Bible because they come and they've
[1:11:08] elevated man's ideas and man's thoughts
[1:11:11] above the word of God just in the same
[1:11:14] way that those Greek and Roman Idol
[1:11:15] worshippers they believed in some
[1:11:17] mythical god like Jupiter and Apollo
[1:11:20] they believed in prostrating themselves
[1:11:22] before those idols and offering candles
[1:11:24] and food and having communion with the
[1:11:26] idols and that communion actually turned
[1:11:28] down through time and where in the Roman
[1:11:30] Catholic church today they take that
[1:11:32] that round wafer that that was taken
[1:11:34] from the son God worship and and and
[1:11:36] Idol speaking back to worshippers and
[1:11:38] the Pueblo Indians in the US and all of
[1:11:41] them were were real real sincere
[1:11:44] worshippers not Hypocrites they are
[1:11:47] sincere people brother R will say just
[1:11:50] as sincere as you and I and sometimes
[1:11:52] more than we are here in America they
[1:11:55] are not Hypocrites they truly believe
[1:11:57] that and practice it with all that's in
[1:12:01] them many times they stick their tongue
[1:12:03] out and have a lance with a fork on it
[1:12:04] go through their tongue or if they if
[1:12:07] they told a lie they'll sew their mouth
[1:12:09] shut to to kind of as as Penance for
[1:12:11] saying something wrong they're very
[1:12:15] sincere but it ain't your sincerity that
[1:12:18] matters all your sincerity doesn't mean
[1:12:21] it God has only promised one way you
[1:12:23] think about down through time how many
[1:12:25] how sincere Cain was and how sincere uh
[1:12:28] Esau was come come very sincerely but
[1:12:30] without a real revelation of
[1:12:33] God God rejected Cain because he didn't
[1:12:36] have the spiritual Revelation but he
[1:12:38] come with a sincerity of
[1:12:41] heart I I many of us have seen those
[1:12:43] videos over there in the Philippines
[1:12:45] where they sincerely worship and they
[1:12:47] they they nail themselves to a cross
[1:12:48] sincerely worshiping but but what are
[1:12:51] they worshiping they're sincere about it
[1:12:54] and many today across the land sit in
[1:12:56] churches and they're very sincere about
[1:12:58] it that's why idolatry is a strange
[1:13:02] thing down Through the Ages we've had it
[1:13:05] ever since the beginning of time the
[1:13:06] order of this idol worship is the man
[1:13:09] sets up the idol he fixes the idol then
[1:13:13] he goes in and he prepares himself for
[1:13:15] this great
[1:13:16] worship now he believes that this Idol
[1:13:19] is made in the image of some God that he
[1:13:22] never has has never seen he's without a
[1:13:25] form so he believes he's in the image of
[1:13:29] this Idol that he makes to this God now
[1:13:33] don't let that leave you the image is in
[1:13:36] the image of the mythical god that he
[1:13:40] believes that he is in other words
[1:13:43] they're they're projecting the
[1:13:44] characteristics Authority and worship
[1:13:47] onto that image it's their what they
[1:13:50] believe what they believe they will get
[1:13:53] something from it's from their
[1:13:55] imagination or from their myths rather
[1:13:57] than the true God and then he goes and
[1:14:01] he before this Idol and he prostrates
[1:14:03] himself and he believes that the god
[1:14:06] that's an unseen person comes down into
[1:14:09] this Idol and he believes that he talks
[1:14:11] to God through this Idol that God brings
[1:14:14] himself into this Idol and answers him
[1:14:17] back he believes that God is actually
[1:14:20] speaking to him he believes that he's
[1:14:23] worshiping he believes something really
[1:14:25] true is happening oh you think today all
[1:14:28] across the land people are sitting in
[1:14:30] churches everywhere and listening to to
[1:14:32] false Theology and Creeds they're
[1:14:35] listening to like like so Simon the
[1:14:37] Sorcerer there in Acts and they believe
[1:14:39] that they're getting something but it's
[1:14:40] it's something fake in other words the
[1:14:42] god actually hypnotizes himself from his
[1:14:45] Supernatural standing into this Idol and
[1:14:48] speaks back to the worshipper through
[1:14:50] this Idol and the worshipper in some
[1:14:53] kind of a built up emotional sense
[1:14:56] believes that the idol speaks to him to
[1:14:58] his heart and he's forgiven of his sins
[1:15:00] and what more through this Idol which
[1:15:03] plainly shows it's the
[1:15:05] devil it's the devil that does it they
[1:15:09] don't just do things hurly some of them
[1:15:11] does but there's some real true
[1:15:12] worshippers of those things so he says I
[1:15:15] could tell you stories of how those
[1:15:17] devils and those Idols performing all
[1:15:19] kinds of things make blood come out of
[1:15:22] things and everything else they are
[1:15:25] devils what what is it when you begin to
[1:15:28] elevate something above the word of God
[1:15:30] and allow it to take root in your life
[1:15:33] the devil you you provide an opportunity
[1:15:35] for the devil to begin working in your
[1:15:37] mind it's the it's the devil working in
[1:15:40] your mind like in 2 Corinthians chapter
[1:15:43] 11 he said but I fear lest by any means
[1:15:46] as the serpent begal Eve through his
[1:15:48] subtility subtility to reason in
[1:15:51] someone's mind and begin to make them
[1:15:53] think a little bit differently than the
[1:15:54] word of God yeah but but but it are you
[1:15:57] sure are you really going to die is what
[1:15:59] the serpent told
[1:16:00] Eve but in 2 Corinthians chapter 10 it
[1:16:03] says for the weapons of our Warfare are
[1:16:05] not carnal But Mighty through God to the
[1:16:07] pulling down of strongholds casting down
[1:16:10] imaginations casting down imaginations
[1:16:13] that the devil will put in your mind to
[1:16:14] make you think something different than
[1:16:16] what the word of God says and every High
[1:16:18] thing that exalted itself against the
[1:16:21] knowledge of God and bringing into
[1:16:23] captivity every thought thought to The
[1:16:25] Obedience of Christ it's not just
[1:16:27] thoughts it's something spiritual at
[1:16:30] work now you think when the word of God
[1:16:33] goes to grabbing a hold of your heart
[1:16:34] you begin to meditate on the word of God
[1:16:36] it's it becomes not just thoughts it's
[1:16:39] the person of Jesus Christ that's
[1:16:40] speaking to you and dealing with you
[1:16:43] amen so think this morning that God can
[1:16:45] actually deal with your heart as you sit
[1:16:46] there and listen to the word of God that
[1:16:48] God can actually woo over you and and
[1:16:51] actually be birthed in you like he was
[1:16:54] laid there in that manger be birthed in
[1:16:56] your heart by by you hearing the word of
[1:16:58] God and you'll go away maybe and think
[1:17:00] well it's just a thought but it's not a
[1:17:02] thought it's a person now the same way
[1:17:05] you sit there and you open up your mind
[1:17:07] to the the thing the idolatrous things
[1:17:09] of the world and begin to listen to the
[1:17:11] things of the listen to movies and
[1:17:14] television shows and and fake things of
[1:17:16] this world and open up a channel to the
[1:17:18] devil and and it's not a thought it's
[1:17:20] not just a thought it's the devil it's
[1:17:22] actually a person a person speaking to
[1:17:24] you you and brother Brandon would say
[1:17:26] now there's teaching goes on that says
[1:17:28] the devil is just an evil thought you
[1:17:30] get no it ain't the Devil is a person
[1:17:34] the same people believes that the Holy
[1:17:35] Ghost is just a good thought you get but
[1:17:38] don't believe that the Holy Ghost is a
[1:17:40] person it's the person of Christ in
[1:17:42] spirit form you ought to think this
[1:17:44] morning that your thinking is actually
[1:17:46] influenced by a person that there are
[1:17:49] demonic forces at work and there are
[1:17:51] spiritual forces at work there's forces
[1:17:53] from both sides
[1:17:55] and whatever you want to have
[1:17:56] preeminence in your life is whatever you
[1:17:58] yield yourself to oh if you could like
[1:18:00] brother Aaron was saying this morning if
[1:18:02] you want to get closer to God then read
[1:18:04] the Bible and pray when you read the
[1:18:06] Bible and pray and begin to meditate
[1:18:08] upon God's word it begins to allow a
[1:18:10] channel for God's spirit to move in your
[1:18:12] life and the same thing when you begin
[1:18:14] to meditate on the things of this world
[1:18:16] and think about the lust of the Flesh
[1:18:17] and the pride of life and all those
[1:18:19] things that begins to allow the de devil
[1:18:21] to move in your life Satan began there's
[1:18:25] a quote where he said Satan began at the
[1:18:27] principal part to cause the spirit of
[1:18:28] man your mind to doubt God's word god
[1:18:31] began at the principle part to lay his
[1:18:34] word in that spirit and your mind
[1:18:36] accepts it and grasp it what is your
[1:18:38] mind controlled by your spirit and your
[1:18:41] spirit catches the word of God and
[1:18:43] that's the thing that's got life in it
[1:18:46] it brings life into you oh to think if
[1:18:49] we just really recognize what this word
[1:18:51] is it's not just knowledge it's not just
[1:18:53] intellect but it's actually
[1:18:55] something that will birth Christ into
[1:18:57] your life that will actually change you
[1:18:59] and now the same thing with the devil's
[1:19:01] got a message too and he's got a message
[1:19:03] to bring death to you and his message is
[1:19:06] that your life is purposeless that
[1:19:08] there's no meaning to your life that
[1:19:10] there's no nothing but heartache and
[1:19:12] depression I thank God that God has
[1:19:14] given us the the weapon to defeat our
[1:19:16] adversary the weapon if we'll take a
[1:19:18] hold of God's word like brother Aaron
[1:19:20] was saying this morning you don't have
[1:19:22] to deal with depression and anxiety but
[1:19:24] you you've got the weapon to put him
[1:19:26] under your feet put him under your feet
[1:19:28] just like Christ did there on the cross
[1:19:30] where he put He died on the cross so
[1:19:32] that we you don't have to you don't have
[1:19:34] to deal with any of the stuff that the
[1:19:36] devil throws at you you can if you take
[1:19:38] a hold of God's word and let it begin to
[1:19:40] change you it will change your thinking
[1:19:42] it will take away that depression it
[1:19:44] will take away those depressive thoughts
[1:19:46] it will take away those thoughts where
[1:19:48] you think it's you're beyond hope and
[1:19:50] you're beyond salvation and you're
[1:19:51] beyond this and that why because it's
[1:19:54] the word of God that's changing you amen
[1:19:58] now now listen on both sides neither one
[1:20:01] is a hypocrite he said have you got that
[1:20:03] that worshipper that idolatry is not a
[1:20:06] hypocrite he actually is getting a hold
[1:20:08] of something that's in that Idol because
[1:20:11] it comes back on him he does something
[1:20:14] gets it from that Idol which is a myth
[1:20:17] God not a real one worshippers genuinely
[1:20:21] believe the idol brings them something
[1:20:24] in turn Amen in other words there's an
[1:20:26] emotional and spiritual interaction but
[1:20:29] rooted in
[1:20:30] deception now now I I think why it's
[1:20:33] important to kind of belabor these
[1:20:34] things is aren't you glad when you know
[1:20:37] that you've got the real that you're not
[1:20:39] looking at something fake you're not
[1:20:40] looking at something that the world has
[1:20:42] lifted up and and made some kind of a
[1:20:44] fake God a fake something that you could
[1:20:46] look at but you know what the word of
[1:20:48] God says and you know what the your
[1:20:50] purpose in life is and you know what God
[1:20:52] has done for you and you you can look
[1:20:54] both boldly it's like it's almost like
[1:20:57] it's like Christmas again where where
[1:20:59] the world looks at Santa Claus and all
[1:21:01] those other things but you can look at
[1:21:03] it differently you can look at it
[1:21:05] knowing that God has birthed his life in
[1:21:07] your heart and God has changed you and
[1:21:09] it's something different because you
[1:21:11] know the real meaning of it many times
[1:21:14] the devil gets into those things and the
[1:21:16] devil gets into meeting sometimes and
[1:21:18] impersonates himself as
[1:21:21] God I find people brother R say coming
[1:21:23] to the Altar and when blind sayings of
[1:21:25] blind teachers they'll say just open up
[1:21:27] forget everything make your mind a blank
[1:21:30] you'll become an Elijah you'll become
[1:21:32] this or that what a lie that's to open
[1:21:35] up your soul to all kinds of devil
[1:21:38] Spirits do you realize what he's saying
[1:21:41] when we come to church when we read our
[1:21:42] Bible we're not blanking out our mind
[1:21:45] but we're looking soberly steadfastly
[1:21:48] into the word of God and that is what
[1:21:50] your faith that is what your
[1:21:52] Christianity that's what everything is
[1:21:54] based upon on the word of God not just
[1:21:55] blanking your mind out not just oh
[1:21:58] that's that's that's where the the the
[1:22:00] challenge with really framing up what
[1:22:02] prayer is because if you go in prayer
[1:22:05] like a Buddhist or a seik or Jane or
[1:22:07] whatever and just pray with your mind
[1:22:09] blanked out or meditate or whatever then
[1:22:11] you're not going to get anywhere and you
[1:22:12] might open up yourself to some wrong
[1:22:15] thing but if you meditate and pray based
[1:22:18] upon the word of God then God can begin
[1:22:20] to move in your heart and in your
[1:22:22] life he said I've seen good people and
[1:22:25] Pentecostal people pastors who didn't
[1:22:28] understand people get into hysterics and
[1:22:30] fall into transes and everything like
[1:22:32] that and do things and finally run them
[1:22:34] into the in insane institution but it
[1:22:37] was opening up their heart innocent
[1:22:39] people and Devils came in and taking
[1:22:41] place there is a real devil oh what is
[1:22:45] it devils in
[1:22:47] Disguise so many people today opening
[1:22:50] opening their hearts to the wrong
[1:22:52] thing you get a spirit all right but
[1:22:55] many times it contradicts the word
[1:22:57] saying the days of Miracles has passed
[1:22:59] there's no such a thing as this or that
[1:23:02] remember that's a devil under the
[1:23:05] disguising of
[1:23:06] Christianity now you see what he's
[1:23:08] really saying you go and sit in a
[1:23:10] meeting and and and all they're
[1:23:12] preaching about is money and trying to
[1:23:14] get your money that that ain't the word
[1:23:16] of God you said you sit in a meeting and
[1:23:19] they begin to tell you well the days of
[1:23:20] Miracles have passed if you want healing
[1:23:22] it's it's too late they had healing in
[1:23:24] the early church but it's too late for
[1:23:26] you to get healed now that that ain't
[1:23:28] the word of God if you sit in a church
[1:23:30] and they're telling you to to be
[1:23:31] baptized in the name of of of of the
[1:23:34] Father Son and Holy Ghost when nobody in
[1:23:36] the Bible was ever baptized that way
[1:23:38] other than the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:23:40] Christ then that's contrary to the word
[1:23:42] of God when they're when you sit in a
[1:23:44] church and they're telling you things
[1:23:46] contrary to the word of God they're
[1:23:47] lifting up something else higher than
[1:23:49] the word of God and it's not the spirit
[1:23:51] of Christ because the spirit of Christ
[1:23:53] comes to the word every time and the
[1:23:55] spirit of Christ cannot deny his
[1:23:57] word in 1 Timothy 4:1 it says now the
[1:24:00] spirit speaketh expressly that in the
[1:24:03] latter times some shall depart from the
[1:24:05] faith giving heed to seducing spirits
[1:24:08] and doctrines of devils oh you better
[1:24:11] believe the devil's got some Doctrine
[1:24:12] and their seducing Spirits sneaky
[1:24:14] Spirits sneaky spirits that will make
[1:24:17] themselves look like something that's
[1:24:18] correct there something that's good but
[1:24:20] but behind it it's a lie a lie just just
[1:24:23] a lie just is wrong as Santa Claus is
[1:24:25] wrong it's it's if Santa Claus is it it
[1:24:29] matters whether it's true or not then
[1:24:31] the word of God matters whether it's
[1:24:32] true or not and 2 Corinthians chapter 11
[1:24:35] and no Marvel for Satan himself is TR
[1:24:38] transformed into an angel of Light right
[1:24:41] and brother R would say he'd said how
[1:24:43] how did a pagan come to
[1:24:45] worship and I I'm going to close in just
[1:24:48] a moment I'm not I don't plan to keep
[1:24:49] you long but we'll just look at some of
[1:24:51] these thoughts and then we'll close in a
[1:24:53] minute here
[1:24:55] how did a pagan come to
[1:24:57] worship he'd go to the temple and find
[1:25:00] the priest then he'd given him an
[1:25:02] offering for so much
[1:25:04] money and then there' be maybe in one
[1:25:07] Temple there might might be more than
[1:25:09] many many different kinds of gods you go
[1:25:11] to Rome and they had that seven mile W
[1:25:13] wall around the city of Rome and right
[1:25:16] there in the inside of the wall they had
[1:25:18] 400 temples to pretty much every kind of
[1:25:21] God that you could ever want uh you know
[1:25:23] and and you go over to India today and
[1:25:25] they've got Gods with eight arms and
[1:25:28] gods with elephant heads and gods of all
[1:25:31] different kind of permutations and every
[1:25:32] every kind of thing that you could look
[1:25:34] for so the Pagan priest he would go to
[1:25:36] him and he'd give him some kind of money
[1:25:38] and the Pagan priest would give him back
[1:25:40] a candle just a regular tow of candle
[1:25:42] and then the worshipper take that candle
[1:25:45] and then he'd go over to that certain
[1:25:47] altar of this God that he wanted to talk
[1:25:48] to and on this altar was fire where the
[1:25:51] sacrifice would be burned at the Statue
[1:25:54] the big bronze Temple or Idol and he
[1:25:56] took this candle and lit it from the
[1:25:58] fire Altar and he lit the candle he went
[1:26:01] over and you know maybe maybe he he he
[1:26:04] put that candle lit the at the foot of
[1:26:06] the altar where the God was so that
[1:26:09] maybe the the God would know which which
[1:26:11] Idol to go into is what what the point
[1:26:14] he's trying to make and then he would go
[1:26:16] back out on the floor of the Tabernacle
[1:26:19] and there he would prostrate himself on
[1:26:21] the floor and then they made an offering
[1:26:24] and he said that was the kind of the
[1:26:26] first church that was what the the the
[1:26:29] RO the the first pilgrims of the Gospel
[1:26:31] when they came to wrong found was these
[1:26:34] people in this kind of a worship where
[1:26:37] they would and he said now in my travel
[1:26:38] I've noticed that idolatry hasn't
[1:26:40] changed and neither has true
[1:26:43] Christianity changed that that that
[1:26:45] idolatry has still carried over where
[1:26:47] Jeremiah talking about how the women
[1:26:49] made cakes under Baal the son God and
[1:26:52] that same idolatry carried right over
[1:26:54] into the Roman Catholic church today
[1:26:55] where they take the that circular thing
[1:26:57] that cake and now they're taking
[1:26:59] communion with it as a symbol of going
[1:27:02] you could trace it all the way back to
[1:27:03] Baal where in the bible Jesus said that
[1:27:06] when they took communion the bread was
[1:27:08] broken it was broken not a little round
[1:27:10] cake to symbolize the Sun or something
[1:27:13] but it was broken like his body there on
[1:27:15] the cross and he said the Roman priest
[1:27:19] adopted this by taking and making the
[1:27:21] communion instead of a broken parcel
[1:27:23] like the body of Christ they would make
[1:27:24] it round like the Sun or the
[1:27:28] moon
[1:27:30] now it we've got to stay right with the
[1:27:33] word because anything contrary to the
[1:27:36] word is wrong he' say any teaching of
[1:27:39] any church Let It Be Baptist me
[1:27:41] Presbyterian Methodist Pentecostal or
[1:27:44] whatever it may be that don't stay
[1:27:46] letter by letter with this Bible is
[1:27:49] wrong so how you going to add these
[1:27:51] Pagan idol worship symbols making three
[1:27:53] gods out of one and all these other
[1:27:56] Pagan Affairs which the early church
[1:27:58] never taught it and was against it stay
[1:28:01] right with the word and you're always
[1:28:03] right but when you get off that word
[1:28:05] you'll go anywhere now you can see how
[1:28:08] you look at these these videos of things
[1:28:10] of different churches I we went we went
[1:28:12] to a church recently where they had you
[1:28:13] know the pride flag on the wall now tell
[1:28:16] me where that is in the Bible and see
[1:28:18] how you begin to be get lifted up with
[1:28:20] your own understanding and and begin to
[1:28:23] that that's that's true Modern Age
[1:28:25] idolatry where people are sitting there
[1:28:27] in church and they're listening to
[1:28:29] something contrary to the word but
[1:28:31] they're accepting it as though they're
[1:28:33] getting something from God and just as
[1:28:35] they made a golden calf there under that
[1:28:37] mountain where they were waiting for
[1:28:39] Moses made it out of the imagination of
[1:28:41] their mind now they're framing up what
[1:28:43] they expect God to be from the
[1:28:45] imagination of their mind and they made
[1:28:46] of an idol that matches what they think
[1:28:49] it should be well I think God is a God
[1:28:51] where he just loves anybody whatever
[1:28:54] you know and God God does love us he
[1:28:57] wants us to come to church in whatever
[1:28:59] our condition is but you're not going to
[1:29:01] stay that way you're going to be changed
[1:29:03] to be conformed to the image of the word
[1:29:05] of God and that's what your purpose is
[1:29:07] you were predestinated to be conformed
[1:29:09] to the image of the Son of God you are
[1:29:12] predestinated to match up and line up
[1:29:14] your life with the word of God and the
[1:29:15] word of God is our Baseline standard so
[1:29:18] if the word of God says that it's
[1:29:20] unseemly for men to lie with men or
[1:29:22] whatever then you go to a church and you
[1:29:24] got a pride flag you're off the word if
[1:29:26] it's if if Santa Claus is a lie it's a
[1:29:28] lie if if all these doctrines of the
[1:29:30] world is a lie it's a lie see I'm so
[1:29:34] glad today that we've got the truth we
[1:29:36] can look steadfastly into the word of
[1:29:38] God and have a present tense revelation
[1:29:41] of what God is doing in this age and
[1:29:43] know now that's real Christianity to
[1:29:46] know that God that we're not looking at
[1:29:47] some fake Idol and expecting to get
[1:29:50] something back and we're not being
[1:29:51] changed at all but we think we're
[1:29:53] hearing the truth but we're looking
[1:29:55] steadfastly into the word of God and
[1:29:57] we're hearing back the truth God is
[1:29:59] speaking to us and it's actually
[1:30:01] changing our lives and changing our
[1:30:04] thinking it's changing it's not leaving
[1:30:06] us in the condition where we were but
[1:30:08] it's changing us and bringing us
[1:30:10] out now now brother around he' tell this
[1:30:14] story about how he was in a meeting at a
[1:30:16] big Pentecostal
[1:30:18] church and he was preaching the word and
[1:30:22] this lady jumped up one night and and he
[1:30:25] said I I knew she was going to jump up
[1:30:27] the next night the first night she
[1:30:28] jumped up he said I saw her she had she
[1:30:30] she's not even living a life that
[1:30:32] conforms to the word her life you can
[1:30:34] tell you can take one look at her and he
[1:30:36] said she had a skin tight suit on she
[1:30:39] had bobbed hair and she's going to get
[1:30:41] up jump up and tell him where he's wrong
[1:30:44] behind the
[1:30:45] pulpit he said that night he said a
[1:30:48] woman jumped up speaking in tongues and
[1:30:50] interrupted the alra call and that night
[1:30:52] when I come back in Billy met me out
[1:30:54] there and said you know what that woman
[1:30:55] said she had another message tonight she
[1:30:57] was going to
[1:30:58] give and I looked at the woman Bob tear
[1:31:01] a dress on so tight looked like she was
[1:31:02] poured into it sitting up there fixing
[1:31:04] her hair pulling up her stockings I
[1:31:07] knowed she was going to jump up and she
[1:31:08] jumped up and I said sit
[1:31:11] down she just kept on I said do you hear
[1:31:14] me sit down oh
[1:31:16] my and when I went out that night now
[1:31:19] now this is the Modern Age the modern
[1:31:21] perception of things people get real UPS
[1:31:24] set when the word of God is preached in
[1:31:25] truth and power there was four or five
[1:31:28] of them guys she had some people to back
[1:31:31] her up back up her false
[1:31:34] Doctrine met me out there said you
[1:31:36] grieve the spirit I said any spirit that
[1:31:39] I grieve with the word of God ought to
[1:31:41] be grieved I said don't the bible say
[1:31:44] that the spirit of the prophets is
[1:31:45] subject to the prophet he said but but
[1:31:48] you're now this is how this is how the
[1:31:50] modern age is so twisted up in our
[1:31:53] thinking in the in the thinking he said
[1:31:55] but you're teaching the word now ain't
[1:31:58] that the most important thing and see
[1:32:01] the world has gotten away from the word
[1:32:03] until to the point where you preach
[1:32:04] longer than 15 minutes and it's like
[1:32:06] this is not what I come to church for
[1:32:08] you come to church for entertainment and
[1:32:10] all other kind of coffee and everything
[1:32:12] El that's what the world comes to church
[1:32:14] for but a real boring and Christian
[1:32:16] wants the word of God because that's
[1:32:18] where they get their strength
[1:32:19] from that's what Clos closed them in the
[1:32:22] arm of a real believer the the helmet of
[1:32:25] salvation and the breastplate of
[1:32:27] righteousness and your feet Shaw with
[1:32:29] the preparation of the gospel of peace
[1:32:30] and all those things it's the word of
[1:32:32] God that's clothing you now you're but
[1:32:35] you're teaching the word and he I said
[1:32:37] that's what I'm standing by he said she
[1:32:39] had something fresh and new from heaven
[1:32:42] now that's the definition of idolatry
[1:32:44] somebody coming along it ain't got
[1:32:46] nothing to do with the word it ain't got
[1:32:48] nothing to do at all but she got
[1:32:51] something fresh and new from heaven and
[1:32:52] that's what the world rather have
[1:32:54] something different from that if that
[1:32:56] isn't he said if that isn't back to
[1:32:58] Roman
[1:33:00] Catholicism I don't know what is let
[1:33:03] every man's word be a lie and every
[1:33:05] Spirit be a lie and God's word be the
[1:33:08] truth God's word first oh you see what
[1:33:12] Roman Catholicism becomes it's a lot of
[1:33:14] man-made ideas people pray into dead
[1:33:17] Saint to their dead relatives and you're
[1:33:19] not a saint until you die and all all
[1:33:22] kinds of things that are just man made
[1:33:24] ideas that don't even come from
[1:33:25] scripture Peter was never in Rome but
[1:33:27] the churches buil on him and Priests
[1:33:29] can't get married but Peter had a wife
[1:33:31] and all it's all made up and Ma just
[1:33:34] just out of man's ideas and then that
[1:33:37] Harlot that the Bible talks about had a
[1:33:39] lot of daughters and it spread out into
[1:33:42] all this denominational system do you
[1:33:43] know what a denomination is it's putting
[1:33:45] structure around the word of God to bind
[1:33:48] it so that you can't keep moving on and
[1:33:51] it creates a a band a bond around it
[1:33:54] well we we've got it figured out we've
[1:33:57] got it figured out and you can't keep
[1:33:59] moving on if God reveals something else
[1:34:02] to you later on you're stuck because
[1:34:04] that denomination will pull you back to
[1:34:06] what they say is right and you'll never
[1:34:09] be able to move on past the structure of
[1:34:12] that denominational system which is the
[1:34:14] daughter of the mother Harlot the Roman
[1:34:16] Catholic system so they formed that
[1:34:18] first church the first Roman Catholic
[1:34:20] Church oh the reason why this is
[1:34:22] important is because in Revelation
[1:34:23] chapter 10 a mighty Angel come down from
[1:34:26] God out of Heaven A Mighty Angel come
[1:34:28] down with an open book a mighty Angel
[1:34:31] come down and he put one foot on the
[1:34:33] land and one foot on the sea amen one
[1:34:36] foot on the land Hallelujah you take one
[1:34:38] of those feet and lift it up and and
[1:34:40] you'd be looking at all these
[1:34:41] denominational systems that Roman
[1:34:44] Catholic system now aren't you glad that
[1:34:46] because you've looked into the word of
[1:34:47] God in this age your foot was put on all
[1:34:51] of those ble wow maybe maybe you didn't
[1:34:53] come out of it but you now you can look
[1:34:56] back and you're you're in a different
[1:34:58] state of your thinking where you know
[1:35:00] how to be baptized and your foot is now
[1:35:03] on all that wrong Doctrine your foot is
[1:35:06] on on those wrong doctrines of how to be
[1:35:09] baptized and how to be born again and
[1:35:11] how to do this and how to do that and
[1:35:13] your foot is on it because Christ come
[1:35:16] down with an open book and put his foot
[1:35:18] on the land and the Sea he put his foot
[1:35:19] on the sea where that that creature come
[1:35:21] up out of the O up out of the sea in
[1:35:24] Revelations 13 he put his foot on all of
[1:35:26] those things all those wrong things so
[1:35:29] that you could have dominion
[1:35:31] [Music]
[1:35:34] too let me skip over some of
[1:35:37] this arenus said the word of God is like
[1:35:40] a fine bunch of nice big jewels that was
[1:35:43] placed out to make a statue of a great
[1:35:44] mighty king it said Creeds dogmas
[1:35:47] denominations take those beautiful
[1:35:49] jewels and make the form of a dog out of
[1:35:52] it and deceive the ignorant of the the
[1:35:53] word this they do to corrupt the words
[1:35:56] of God and to bring a reproach upon
[1:35:58] it oh to think what a picture that
[1:36:02] paints that the word of God is like a a
[1:36:05] a bunch of jewels in the shape of a
[1:36:07] king and that denominational structure
[1:36:10] will take those jewels and make it look
[1:36:13] like a dog to deceive the ignorant of
[1:36:16] the word you try to make the word of God
[1:36:19] say something to fit your organization
[1:36:21] you're taking the jewels out of the
[1:36:23] Great King's body and making an image of
[1:36:25] a dog or a fox or a hog or something out
[1:36:28] of it oh that's why this this gospel
[1:36:31] message that we've heard was given to
[1:36:32] give Liberty to so that we can know what
[1:36:35] we believe and and carry us away from
[1:36:37] all the structures and all the
[1:36:39] limitations all the nianis and all to to
[1:36:43] to actually turn loose the spirit of God
[1:36:45] back in the church
[1:36:46] again it matters what you believe
[1:36:52] amen you know where you got
[1:36:54] Christmas he would say as we about to
[1:36:58] close Christ is born in
[1:37:00] April but what did they do the solar
[1:37:03] system is slowing up now as it gets away
[1:37:05] each day getting a little longer a
[1:37:07] little shorter and a little shorter and
[1:37:09] from the 20th until the 25th is when the
[1:37:10] Sun God had his
[1:37:12] birthday there's about five days there
[1:37:15] that's when the Roman circus in that
[1:37:16] time the celebration of the son God's
[1:37:18] birthday at that time and now you see
[1:37:20] what you got now they said make it the
[1:37:22] son God they take it Son of God and the
[1:37:24] whole thing is Pagan to begin with and
[1:37:27] the people on the streets with their
[1:37:28] high heeled shoes and they're twisting
[1:37:30] up and down the streets and running into
[1:37:32] stores and here the other day my wife
[1:37:34] was telling me someone said I don't know
[1:37:35] what to get Daddy said brother's going
[1:37:38] to get him a cord of whiskey and the
[1:37:40] other one said he was going to get him
[1:37:42] some champagne and one said well I'm
[1:37:44] going to get him a poker set celebration
[1:37:47] of Christmas Pagan devil worship
[1:37:51] Hallelujah now that's where the
[1:37:52] celebration of Christmas becomes wrong
[1:37:55] when you get away from the word of God
[1:37:57] Amen oh what we need to do is get away
[1:38:00] from the word of
[1:38:02] God Assemblies of God Four Square
[1:38:04] Pentecostal Oneness come back to the
[1:38:07] word of God he said quit some of these
[1:38:08] here denominational Idols denominational
[1:38:12] Sphinx they Bewitched themselves the
[1:38:14] spirit of the devil into these
[1:38:16] denominational Idols do you know that
[1:38:19] denomination is an idol yes why is it an
[1:38:22] idol cuz you say are you you a Christian
[1:38:24] well I'm a
[1:38:25] presbyterian but that ain't the question
[1:38:29] are you a Christian I'm a Methodist are
[1:38:31] you a Christian I'm Pentecostal and
[1:38:34] you're elevating something up you're
[1:38:36] looking at something else than than what
[1:38:38] the word says a Christian is that's not
[1:38:40] the answer to the question that don't
[1:38:42] mean no more than what you're a hog or a
[1:38:45] dog or a skunk has no more to do with it
[1:38:48] you know what idolatry is it's a Dead
[1:38:50] image a Dead image of a mythical god
[1:38:53] it's something that you can look at and
[1:38:55] it has no life in it and and today you
[1:38:58] look around at the churches of the day
[1:38:59] and you just can't hardly find one
[1:39:01] that's got real life in it life where
[1:39:04] people are being changed not not leaving
[1:39:06] the doors and walking right back out in
[1:39:08] the world and looking like the world
[1:39:09] again but but changed when you come into
[1:39:13] a church where the spirit of God is
[1:39:14] moving people are walking out the doors
[1:39:17] and they don't look like the world and
[1:39:18] they don't talk like the world and
[1:39:20] they're acting different because they've
[1:39:21] been changed all that drinking and
[1:39:24] smoking and carry on has dropped away
[1:39:26] because the word of God got a hold of
[1:39:28] their life now that's what real
[1:39:29] Christianity is Christianity is living
[1:39:32] images of a living God not not a Dead
[1:39:36] image of a mythical god but a living
[1:39:38] image of a living God and now we've been
[1:39:41] made partakers of his Holiness we In His
[1:39:43] Image we are living images of a living
[1:39:47] God why by humbling oursel to his death
[1:39:50] and Reckoning ourself nothing then the
[1:39:52] Holy Ghost comes in and lifts it lifts
[1:39:55] us up what what is the Living God it's
[1:39:58] the word in you making itself real now
[1:40:02] that's what Christianity is really about
[1:40:04] and that's what Christmas is really
[1:40:06] about that God would come down and and
[1:40:08] live in that little manger that God
[1:40:10] himself would be tabernacled in that
[1:40:13] little baby laying in there in that
[1:40:14] manger and that's what Christmas T this
[1:40:16] morning is really about that God can
[1:40:18] come and Tabernacle himself in you and
[1:40:21] make you a living representation of
[1:40:23] himself that is God himself tabernacling
[1:40:26] himself and you walking your feet using
[1:40:29] your hands and using your eyes and using
[1:40:31] your mouth to speak Liberty and help to
[1:40:33] somebody else now that means that if
[1:40:36] you're part of the body of
[1:40:38] Christ that you got a purpose that
[1:40:41] you've got a reason for being here this
[1:40:43] morning you've got a reason for being
[1:40:45] here on this Earth no matter how little
[1:40:48] you are how small you are now now see he
[1:40:51] said look Christ is the head of the body
[1:40:53] and wherever the head is the body's with
[1:40:56] it where my body where my head goes it
[1:40:59] takes my body with it and now we have
[1:41:01] got that picture of the cloud that we
[1:41:03] look at the cloud over Arizona that come
[1:41:05] years ago you know that's a sign if if
[1:41:07] you can see the sign of the head that's
[1:41:09] a sign that the body is here too and you
[1:41:12] are part of that body and it don't
[1:41:14] matter whether you're a big part of the
[1:41:16] body a notable part or a little small
[1:41:19] part of that body no matter where you
[1:41:21] are in that body you have you can have
[1:41:24] dominion over the devil brother R would
[1:41:26] say look you say but brother random I'm
[1:41:28] the least one the least part of the body
[1:41:31] would be the bottom of Jesus's feet but
[1:41:34] if you're the least part of the body
[1:41:36] that means you still got your foot on
[1:41:38] the devil's neck oh I was thinking I was
[1:41:41] sitting back there in the study reading
[1:41:42] that story of how Joshua Fought the the
[1:41:45] five amalaki Kings and when he defeated
[1:41:49] all those kings they went and hid in the
[1:41:50] cave and they drug them out and he he
[1:41:53] brought brought all those kings before
[1:41:54] his people and he told his people go
[1:41:57] take your foot and put it on the neck of
[1:41:59] those kings and you know that's what
[1:42:01] this gospel has giv you power to do you
[1:42:03] don't have to take nothing from the
[1:42:04] devil anymore if you're the least part
[1:42:07] of the body then you still got your foot
[1:42:10] on the devil's neck that means you don't
[1:42:12] have to put up with depression you don't
[1:42:14] have to put up with that anxiety you
[1:42:16] don't have to put up with wondering what
[1:42:17] you're doing here that's what the gospel
[1:42:20] is for to give you purpose and meaning
[1:42:22] in your life to know that you were
[1:42:24] predestinated to be a living a living
[1:42:26] Idol a living God using your human flesh
[1:42:30] that's why in First Corinthians it said
[1:42:32] for Heath put all things under his feet
[1:42:34] but when he saith all things are put
[1:42:36] under him it is manifested that he is
[1:42:38] accepted which did put all things under
[1:42:40] him so he said brother Bram I got no
[1:42:42] power neither do I I don't have any
[1:42:45] power well brother brandham I'm a weakly
[1:42:48] so am I but I'm not depending in my
[1:42:50] strength it ain't my strength now now
[1:42:53] aren't you glad that he framed it up
[1:42:55] this that way amen so many times we come
[1:42:57] to a church service and we feel like we
[1:42:59] got something to prove we we struggle in
[1:43:02] our mind well I got to have faith I got
[1:43:04] to I got to prove to everybody that I
[1:43:06] I'm a real Christian but when you look
[1:43:08] at it this way you don't have to prove
[1:43:10] nothing it's God that does the prove and
[1:43:12] all you got to do is believe him if you
[1:43:14] got Affliction in your body if you've
[1:43:16] got cancer or a migraine or a backache
[1:43:19] like I had the other day just believe
[1:43:21] God and God will come on the and take it
[1:43:23] from you take it away why because you
[1:43:25] ain't got to prove nothing it's all him
[1:43:28] God is the one that's doing The
[1:43:30] Proven he said it's like a traffic cop
[1:43:33] the the CRA traffic cop many times I've
[1:43:35] walked down the streets of Atlanta and
[1:43:37] you see a little cop out there with the
[1:43:39] cars whizzing by and he just steps out
[1:43:41] in the road and everybody all the cars
[1:43:43] stop but but that car a big old Mac
[1:43:46] Truck could just run him right over but
[1:43:49] that cop will step right out why cuz
[1:43:51] he's got his uniform on and that uniform
[1:43:54] is respected and you know the Bible says
[1:43:56] put on the whole armor of God and that's
[1:43:58] our uniform put on the whole armor of
[1:44:00] God that you may be able to stand
[1:44:02] against the Ws of the devil what is that
[1:44:04] armor the the helmet of salvation and so
[1:44:07] forth all those things it's your armor
[1:44:09] is Jesus Christ your armor is the Holy
[1:44:12] Ghost now that's a real Christmas story
[1:44:15] that God would fill you with his holy
[1:44:17] ghost so he could use you he said not
[1:44:20] that you're strong you're nothing as the
[1:44:22] musicians come forward but it's what's
[1:44:24] behind you why you are dead you join the
[1:44:27] Army you join the police force you're
[1:44:31] going to keep law and control of these
[1:44:33] Devils that's right you're on the police
[1:44:35] force the whole thing's behind you see
[1:44:37] you're reckoned dead you're nothing you
[1:44:38] couldn't stop nothing but your Authority
[1:44:41] that's been given you because you are
[1:44:44] raised and setting in Heavenly places in
[1:44:46] Christ Jesus the devil recognizes that
[1:44:50] amen you believe that this morning yes
[1:44:52] amen
[1:44:53] that the devil recognizes real Holy
[1:44:56] Ghost
[1:44:58] Authority you know I I'm so glad that we
[1:45:01] can real have real Holy Ghost fill
[1:45:02] meetings where the devil don't feel
[1:45:05] welcome that's what I when I come to
[1:45:07] church I want to make the devil so
[1:45:09] uncomfortable that if I'm that battling
[1:45:11] with a mind battle the devil got to
[1:45:13] leave I to make the battle devil so
[1:45:16] uncomfortable he don't know what to do
[1:45:18] oh and brother Brandon want to say now
[1:45:20] as we just kind of finish up here and
[1:45:22] just clinch it he say the badge of your
[1:45:24] Authority is not a name of a
[1:45:27] denomination but it's the power the
[1:45:30] power of the resurrection of Christ in
[1:45:33] each individual Life As We Stand to our
[1:45:35] feet that's your power your power is not
[1:45:38] well I'm a presbyterian or a Methodist
[1:45:40] or even a message believer or whatever
[1:45:42] but your power is that I'm a Christian
[1:45:44] I'm a born again Christian and the word
[1:45:46] of God has been received in my heart and
[1:45:48] I know God for him myself I know him
[1:45:51] because I met him I met him like Moses
[1:45:54] did met him in the burning bush I met
[1:45:56] him like Paul on the road there I met
[1:45:58] him like so many others before I know
[1:46:00] him for myself and I'm not seeking my
[1:46:03] identification from a label or a church
[1:46:05] or identification like that but I know
[1:46:08] him for
[1:46:10] myself that's where you get your power
[1:46:13] from amen amen let's bow our heads in
[1:46:16] our
[1:46:17] hearts Lord Jesus I'm so glad that
[1:46:21] you've given us something that we can
[1:46:22] have confidence in Lord we've been
[1:46:25] clothed like L Zoe coming out Lord
[1:46:28] depicting the bride of Christ in this
[1:46:30] day clothed with the word and your word
[1:46:33] is clothed us clothe us Lord Lord like
[1:46:36] where Paul described it's the AR our
[1:46:38] armor Lord when we're clothed with with
[1:46:41] your righteousness not anything that we
[1:46:43] do not something that we've made up or
[1:46:47] concocted some kind of a myth but we're
[1:46:49] clothed with a genuine unfailing word of
[1:46:53] God it gives us power over the enemy
[1:46:57] Lord Jesus I want to declare this
[1:46:59] morning that the enemy is defeated the
[1:47:01] devil is
[1:47:03] defeated and whatever needs your people
[1:47:05] have Lord I iure them Lord to to claim
[1:47:08] it now Lord God because you already paid
[1:47:11] the price and now it's just up to us to
