TRANSCRIPT
========================================
me ready used to tell people i learned that song when i was in the third grade you don't learn them that way no more queen bee [Music] open the eyes of my heart [Music] holy holy holy man oh oh ryan's coming into his little girls come in the door with their fingers good to see you by the house of the lord you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn back where we've been reading from revelations 1 and revelations 8. enjoyed this morning's message and just try to tie it right on the end and keep on going and i wanted to move on over but felt necessary to speak a little bit about what we were doing this morning so let's just move on over remember now the minister's meeting will be this coming saturday what time 11 11. 10. 10 o'clock this coming saturday so the ministers come and be with us and just have a good time and then we will have to be going to the fellowship meeting at brother longori's in alabama on the third saturday and if you want to go with us let's make sure you let us know you know where we can get everything arranged amen i guess that's all the announcements came across brother tim cross will be preaching for us the lord willing next weekend so remember that this coming weekend the minister's meeting weekend all right so remember that amen amen father we thank you lord for your loving your grace and to us thank you for today thank you that you are god and you change not that way we can depend upon you we can read your word we can study it we can depend on the fact of what you say that we can lay our life upon it and not have to worry we pray this afternoon that you would just come and speak to us and give us some understanding years that we may hear what you're trying to say because lord we know that it's got to be revealed to us we need that more than anything head knowledge is wonderful must be there in preparation getting ready but we need a revelation lord just have your way and guide us now as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts forgive our sins cleanse us of all unrighteousness and keep us in your love in jesus name amen revelations 1 the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel and to his servant john to our record of the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein what for the time is at hand the time to understand is at hand revelations 8 1 and when he had opened the seventh seal there was solace in heaven about the space of hyphen hour so that's just what we've got you may be seated so we deal with that as to understand right it may be a little hot now you may have to turn the fans on this afternoon to keep it because we still don't have the ending working until we can get everything fixed up but we'll do the best we can so that way you you know you just this morning getting set close quick stay warm to see you have to move over to a little family or something i want this to change in the service a minute now what was the main thought we were trying to bring this morning is the thought that we have been bringing down through all of the seals that we had to have a profit to be able to tell these things now i say that really we had to have a prophet to tell us the whole bible right now there was been maybe some things we had lined up and things like that because of of the bible and the ability to to read and the the understanding and all but the our whole dependence upon is upon where whether god sent a prophet all right and we believe he did to bring us the word of god and to reveal that word unto us and then coming down through the seals we know that we saw this morning and we've studied it over and over that there is no combat beast after you come to the fourth seal because that fourth combat beast is an eagle which is a prophet promised of god to come and as it comes in that way we have the ability to receive uh from things that even are not in in symbols right all right because the fifth c06 seal was not a symbol it was a reality or people so we needed someone to be able to tell us who that was or what it is and things coming down and then coming to the seventh seal we would use the same uh layout or thought you know that we must put our total dependence upon god to keep his word and bring us the revelation you know of that seventh seal because it says silence in heaven with a space of half an hour right as i said and i do it for others out there on the internet there's a lot of people trying to figure out what time it was how much time uh 21 days or 21 years or just out of the other but why don't you just turn it around like it's supposed to be it's silence in heaven it didn't say anything about earth you know so how long would silence in heaven be silence in heaven could be 5 000 years in order to be a moon not a thing because they're not dealing with like you and i wearing out because we're standing right it's a totally different situation so then why worry about the time element of it the getting ready now we uh brought that this morning and i kind of changed the title just a little bit and then bringing it in you know of things being revealed and uh now we want to talk about the things that are revealed on the seventh seal it's all is not his name revealed well it says silence in heaven what if we had a prophet to tell us what that was see my point of what i was bringing this morning the reason i got into that i didn't think i'd spend that long i was just going to try to emphasize a little because you see church there were silence under the first seal because we didn't know what that was right the second seal as far as reaping silence to you and i until we know what it is you know i mean you can read it while it's writer but what's the difference if you don't know what that is it's a sealed up mystery it's a silence but see when the prophet come and told us what those symbols were then we could understand at least the symbols of it but we still must have it revealed to us that's right what do you mean that is that's a relevancy that's what people think well you could read it before the prophet came that's right why wouldn't it revelation then right right but see then coming down to the seventh seal then we have to have the dependence upon the fact that god sent a prophet amen and there were some things revealed under this seventh seal as we'll get to it a minute where the prophet said this is my revelation that's the same thing he said about the first seal second seal third fourth fifth sixth this is my revelation he certainly wasn't dependent upon an organized religion revelation or anybody else he said he had to stand along on what he believed well you know if you're a true christian you will really walk alone that's right there's a lot of other people walking along too you know it's not just one thing but still in god it's you and god as a person together right it's not you and god in triple person two three or four more persons he's revealing himself to you and you only that's the way you have to take the word then the other person has to say he's revealing himself to me and to me only because revelation is personal that's right thank god for revelation then that we can be able to say this is mine you know but i'm saying this is my eye he said god gave it to me amen all right so this is my revelation that i'm trying to preach to you because this is what god gave to me but then you have to say that's right you'll hear me emphasize this much more as we go along what is your revelation has god spoken to you are you just taking some person's word you know right that's it are you just taking a five-fold ministry person's word are you just taking brother ronald's word it must be revealed it can't be anything else all right so we look at the seal and see that by way of the prophet we can see what's there [Music] of what the world could not see and we'll never be able to see but now i emphasize again as i was this morning over and over what we cover from under this seventh seal at the prophet said that's what it was remember that cannot cannot be an addition to the word no matter what you can't add to the word right that's right because you add the plagues that are written in the book that's right so it's got to be in the book we read in a minute where the prophet said this seventh seal is spoken from genesis so if it spoke up from genesis he said the word that's right but light had not shined upon it to bring it out into the open that's right to where we could see right now when we were back in the baptist we would preach certain things and and it was true i mean you know what we talked about because we would cover like an old testament scripture bring it down to a new testament and see that this is fulfilled you know i remember when even being dire especially i was myself dealing with it like the coming into the gentiles that paul said that was a mystery it was mystery that was sealed back there in the old testament because the jews wasn't going to have no way in the world gentile would come into their lineage they would they would accept a cross of light they were what the word was for it but they would never accept it to come into the truth all right then back there we'd remember that hey wait a minute rahab was a harlot we didn't know she married a israeli general to come down but you had enough sense to read the bible and tell delineated to come down right you know to a lot of things but still we had to understand it all right that was wonderful and that way it's what we've got to have now is an understanding of god's word so let's follow these things that the prophet spoke of and let him be the one not us but he'll be the one to tell us what is under this seal well if we can stay with that there shouldn't be any problem with believing it you know and then try to see as we try to do with each seal is try to get us to see what is made known to us all right now this seal itself should be very very uh valuable into that doings because it is the end because we'll get to it in a minute so we are in the end time it should be more real to you and i than anywhere because we're in the end time of all kinds all right in doing that then we should be able to follow along and say hey that's speaking to me we will the lord willing maybe in another service or to try to cover some things that brother branham said that seventh seal was to him he said it was the tent he said it was the third pool he said it was the sword in the hand of those things personal to him all right well what about me and you it's got to be something personal to you and i that's right because according to my understanding with all that he had he's in the ground waiting on you and i bring him out now that's the way i believe it because it doesn't say the dependence upon him it says dependence upon you and i right right all right now with that thought let's go into what we were trying to do this morning and we'll drop over to number five of the notes because while i'm getting that up there i'll just go over a little bit of what we were doing brother said on paragraph 249 he said it was a secret any activity in heaven might give away that secret but said it's it is so great it must be included no that's not the quote up there that you read see if i give away a secret that the secret there is must be included right because it's got to happen well now that's establishing something that's real right all right then coming on down we're only presuming until this seal breaks the seventh one remember that this morning that's progress 48 and then down to paragraph 68 and 70. until this 7th seal is broken we're only presuming now to try to explain that is a hard thing yes but the best illustration i can give for something that you are presuming until it takes place but yet you've got to thus saith the lord because he had that as i said this morning throughout the seals he would say this is thus that the lord right then turn and say we're only presuming all right let me try to express it in a way to give us a better understanding there was a man named john who went to the isle of patmos and that's about 1895-96 and he had received the holy ghost somewhere about either way you want to figure it 30 or 33 somewhere you know right or whatever but yet he's crying for a lamb to come right and he knows if the lamb don't come and take the book all is lost now what about a man that's walk with the lord jesus you know three and a half years of his ministry going to pentecost receiving the baptism of the holy ghost placing him at the point we would look at the pyramid behind earth right under the headstone just as close as you could get to the coming of the headstone and yet he's crying for a deliverer right now you understand what i'm using that point for and if he was trying for a deliverer when he already knew within him and all those years he had studied god's word and he's chosen to go to patmos right but yet he's still there's something there that he's it's not finished you know it's not complete all right now that to me is the way i look at it when it when the prophet says if this seventh seal don't broke we're presuming you know right we're standing with thus saith the lord about the seals and the things but waiting for something to take place right now i hope when we get into it we've got enough time this afternoon we will get to the point that you'll see that it it there is something to take place that you and i are still even today longing for right all right i'll just go ahead and put it in here i'm longing for a change of this body amen and that involves one of the things we'll cover in a moment of the coming of the lord that would be involving be involved around that or you say you know all right so then that would be what we're looking at but see we're only presuming until god comes on the scene but we got to promise that he would come on the scene and break this seventh seal because the bible says it's open and the prophet 241 where we gave it this morning he says the lamb breaks it the the seal is broke well no matter what we would think about it not being revealed or whatever we think we should never in any form even have any concept of it not being broke that's right you know that shouldn't be a thought in her mind because the bible says it's broke the prophet says bro right didn't you go over here to this other quote what are you fighting quote i've always told you if you wait long enough yeah man they'll come together right right that's right but until it's revealed it won't come together all right i've had things that i wasn't preaching over 20 30 years why because i had quotes it was contrary so i must wait see you until it's to be made known all right then we got down this morning and we're right now he said i'm going to tell you my revelation of it he said that revelation is in a three-fold man he said i had the revelation that revealed all right and it's in a threefold manner he said i'll speak to you overfolding we're not worried about second third folk we're concerned with a fold of it all right and he said what it was it was those seven thunders that he hurt thunder now that's jumping from revelation 8 1 revelations 10 about two or three there which one spilled for the thunder before he says those thunders that he hurt under right let me say something we'll get to it on the message part but let me say something if it's true that the prophet of god was the voice of god for the age that we're living amen and we believe that right and if it's true that he and he only had the revelation that would reveal the word do you realize what we've been doing for 40 something years reading the word of god in a different perspective than we've ever read or thought about right right now didn't this message begin to open the word to us you know the things coming forth yes and in doing that you realize you could be hearing the thunders but if you're going to say that the prophet brought to revelation you realize when you're reading those messages hearing those tapes of the prophet you're actually hearing the voice of god right right which is the thunder hey man no no no no no thunder i know it well we'll get around to it maybe next week or something but you know where i'll be going to where that jesus there was a voice spoke and he said glorify me with the glory that i had to leave before the world and he said i've glorified thee and i'll glorify you again and the bible said that it thundered well you know a lot of people they heard boom boom boom boom that jesus heard a voice the voice said i'm glorified you're not glorify you again the disciples come along later on and maybe even after his death or whatever and it domes on them we know what was said on that day you know right that everybody else thought it was just a cloud of going over all right right right but we know the void everybody we know what we're saying well another time in the bible there's a man named moses standing at mount sinai and it thundered and they were scared to death but all they heard was the blue and you know why you're scared when it goes bloom bloom thunder don't kill nobody right but we always know that's what causes thunder you know lightning rod and lightning can kill that's right so the thunder ain't the problem right it really shouldn't be a problem anyway because when you hear the thunder lightning it doesn't struck you right or not you know because that's what's causing it but do you understand what i'm getting at but you know that moses heard a voice right moses dirty voice would it be any problem then for daniel right to have heard the thunder spread around himself i think that's the daniel said you wouldn't i'm pretty sure would it be any problem for john the revelator to be on patmos and hear the thunders and know what they said now you better check out something because it run around didn't say that john basically heard what the symbols were wasn't dealing with symbols he was writing down what the symbol was but then he heard the thunders and was forbidden to write could it be that we could have been hearing the thunders for ever since the prophet left or even back into this opening of the seals in 63 and still don't know what it was that's a later message about three months down the road but just getting the point because of what he says here he said it's no seven thunders they heard thunder but john heard him the thunder but he's forbidden to write now you may have your thoughts or whatever uh i'm just honest i try to say it the best way i can because when john came back to write what he saw you know he could only write the symbols and everybody all right but even in his writings of john little john 1 2 3 uh he speaks of the antichrist because he saw that he's the only one in the bible that spoke of the antichrist right because he comes back from patmos one two and three john the little john's we called it was written after coming back from patmos all right now so he he could tell about the antichrist and he could tell a lot of things and he tried to tell a lot of things but you know what i believe i believe what was said in those thunders was removed from his mind when you come back to earth would be like the apostle paul if nothing else because the apostle paul went up to the third heaven and he said same things i can't talk about when you see things you can't talk about that means you ain't got language to bring it in that's right is that just plain you used to get right like ezekiel saying fire falling out of heaven right i mean seeing nuclear destruction but we'll get down to those things a little later and see if god has spoken to you right have you heard the thunder right ma'am not the seven men if they figured out this one this one that wasn't all of that i never did jury snapping right because that's cardinality oh brother you are a guest of my four minutes no i'm against stupidity that's just the best way to say it all right let's go on to number six where we're at this morning then we'll try to get a thought gets going okay now this is the questions and answers before the seventh seal breaks right so look what he said we find out the corruption that he did in the seventh church eight but the seventh seal doesn't reveal anything what's going to happen to it why where's god going to leave us dangling without a way because at the end of that church age has become a prophetic gift to reveal these things he said are you following all right prophetic gift that fourth combat beast that was the eagle to express and tell us what these things are so then he can tell us what the fifth seal is he can tell us what the six seal is and he can tell us what the seventh seal is no problem all right make a quick jump through in two or three quotes to make sure we stay with it go ahead and number seven and how great is god's grace to reveal his secrets to us in this day amen now we all believe that we're living in the last day we believe that and remember the secret was to be revealed in the last days now god how how does he reveal his word his secrets in secret the bible would you like to read where he says it let's just turn over him see i reveal his secrets now i want you to read amos all right so what does amos 3 7 still trumpets blown in the city and the people not be afraid it's got to be evil in the city and the lord has not done it that's odd language for the next statement is simply meaning can a trumpet sound unless it's the gospel trumpet that would come from the prophet and god you know there's evil in the city and it says and the lord has not done it now he didn't do evil he just knows about the evil surely the lord will do nothing but he really reveals his secrets to his servants the prophets now how many times have you heard right around emphasize that how many times have you listened to those words three and seven yep let me just quote a couple and then we'll start reading from the message paradox you don't have to pull these up but again if you want to i'll be going through he said the word always come to the prophet he said in that prophet god said then disproves it then a prophet means not only to speak the word but also to foretell and a divine interpreter of the word divine written word right i like the way he emphasizes the word came to the prophet it's a complete revelation of jesus christ all right the word always comes to the prophet message when their eyes were opened there stood john out in the river and jesus come walking word always come to the prophet amen walked out into the water and came out right word always came to the prophet let's read this one number nine paragraph 101 of the mighty god unveiled and look what he's saying did you notice the one that had give the promise to he brought him forth with the word he had the commandments and after how this this commandment he had the commandment was the word of god now listen the word had never come to the people yet he's about the ten commandments right right the word did not come to the people well the word always goes to the prophet and he was the prophet for the hour it's like jesus was the word john was a prophet and jesus came to him in the water when the word always comes to the prophet look what he said even though moses had the commandments they haven't come to the people yet moses has come down to their carrying them and all right they could read them could they ask you a simple question what language was that ten commandments right i always wondered about this what is hebrew what is greek what's that's just something to fonder over some of you like little points to plunder over so i'll give you one once in a while look at the next one program 172 of the unveiling of god 9 8. the word had to come from moses first see moses had the word they were written by god nobody could interpret them it was in hebrew or greek or any language or you know look like somebody could have told you a little bit about it might have been a heavenly language why because moses had to interpret them first that's the reason he bailed his face because he you see it congratulations amen about what do you say moses had to interpret them god wrote moses interpreted click the next one god hiding in simplicity albuquerque new mexico paragraph 261. he had the word of god and he spoke that word and when he did it become from god's thought the word is a thought expressed and so then when god thought it and put it in moses mind and he spoke it it become a word amen you got the order that's in the seal book i'll find it for you where brett around first it was god's thought then it was moses thought he said it ain't the word yet he said then moses speaks it it becomes a word so look at it but in in his mind he spoke to the kind of word moses turned around and went back maybe to defy something where the word of god spoke by the lips listen the creative word of god that was spoke by the lips of a mortal man that's a wonderful thing god gave it to moses look at the next one progress 67 of the fourth seal the word itself is spirit is spirit and word form and then you see when it's quickened or brought to life the spirit of the word goes to work and acts because that now look here a thought has to be a thought before it can be a word and then when a thought is presented it's a word now this is that god's thought he has placed in the word and what and when we receive it from him it becomes a word this is god's thought right evidently he's pointing towards the bible or doing something this is god's dog oh brother dallas to work oh wonderful jeremiah had to speak it before right now you know what i mean the prophets when they got it look what he said god revealed to moses what to do moses spoke it and it happened that's really when it comes from god and we find out that it stimulates it gives you because it's god's word reigned out beyond nature but what he said he said this is god's thought he's placed in the word and when we receive it from him it becomes worked amen you know all the word that we really have is what's revealed right yeah i got a lot of book holding my hand but only what's revealed is the word right well the rest of us no good now don't be carnal we see it's the word of god god spoke it moses received it as a thought within him and moses went out and spoke it right and there come flies and fleas and frogs and things because the word had always come to the prophet all right now with that thought in mind let's see what is revealed in this seventh seal this recent things the prophet says it is and then maybe we can see that well that's what it is you know because he tells us going to number 10 verse 77 of the seventh seal now the eighth chapter only reveals the scene of the scene of the seventh seal where nothing else is revealed and nothing is not revealed in the seventh seal that has nothing to do with the seventh chapter it's the revealing of the seventh seal it's perfectly mute it's wonderful if only that time i'll try a few places to show you all the way back from genesis this seventh chapter this seventh seal is spoke off from the very beginning in genesis the seventh seal moved right right up all right now number one what do we see under the seventh seal a scene a scene all right so we got something to go on but we need to know what that scene is whatever that scene is called all of the people in heaven to create a scene because they stopped right stood at all see they created a scene because the scene is like an act of a play you know scene one scene two but you know all right so we see that the eighth chapter only reveals a scene one silence in heaven great space half power but that's something to start on yep what we need to know is just what caused that what kind of a scene would take place it would cause all of those cherubims and seraphims that were flying through the sky right worshiping singing holy holy holy and they all hushed we can go back to thoughts and ideas but let's just continue on to see what the prophet had to say okay now another thought is what the seventh seal has to be in the book because it spoke up from genesis you know the corporal body of jesus wasn't in the old testament do you agree who spoke of yes amen isaiah said he'd be beaten to where he couldn't be recognizable yes who was spoke of as i was saying a moment ago the coming in of the gentiles was spoke of throughout the old testament who were not brought into a situation other than proselytes until they're coming into the new testament grace but we've got a scene we've got the seal spoke off so we're not looking for something to be added to the book it's got to be in the book the back of it being spoken put it in the book that's right are you with me or else the prophet said this ain't spoke of nowhere but he didn't he said it spoke of right all right now the lamb breaks the seal we won't go over number 11 jump to number 12. the lamb breaks the seal and they stand in hall because the lamb broke the ceiling yes whatever opened up caused a reaction from the people so now let's find out something else that it is it's paragraph 229 of the seventh seal you remember this seventh seal is the end of all things now the end of all things is an odd situation it doesn't always mean that it's annihilated wiped out worn out or whatever because according to the bible christ was the end of the law but he never come to do away with the law he never come to destroy it he come to magnify so the end doesn't mean always you know you fall off a cliff well that ain't the end there's a bottom down there somewhere it may be a mild deep but there's a bottom well that's not all the end of all things that's right the things written in the seal book sealed up with the plan of redemption from before the foundation of the world right it never been ends it is the end now this is the seventh seal this is where he said this is my revelation right it is in it's the end of the struggling world it's indestructible nature it's the end of everything and there is the end of the trumpets into the vile into the earth it's it's even the end of time time runs out the bible says so matthew which goes to revelation 10 but it's the end when that in the days of this great thing to happen remember when we read it happen everything runs out in this time the end of the at the end of this seventh season then even the ends of the seven seals the end but it even ends the seven seals notice it's the end of the church ages it's the end of the seven seals it's the end of the trumpets into the violence even industry in the millennium that's only seven seals do anywhere in the bible give the time to this time of that in the bible when you find something come to an end you realize that you're speaking on the seventh seal when the old testament came to an end which was calvary and then the resurrection bringing forth it was the ending of that old testament so end can be a beautiful word if you go home and look it up because the word end can mean even be reproduced when something is reproduced it comes to an end well then you can call it reproduction all right but the end now so we found that it's a scene we found that it's in the end of all things getting good getting some material to show us some things he says what happened is those don't pull up 13 is okay they don't hurt it let's go over here to revelation to begin what happened is those seven thunders that he earth under and was forbidden to write that's what the mystery is laying behind those seven consecutive thunders rolling out go ahead at number 14. very out 255. seven god's perfect number run around knock six times on the pulpit you'll probably find on the other versions he'll say seven just right down the road seven thunders uttered straight together like they were spelling they're spelling out something notice at that time john started to write and he hears it he knows what it is right that's right he said don't write it jesus never spoke of it john couldn't write it angels know nothing about it what is it it's the thing that jesus said even the angels of heaven didn't know nothing about it all right you can make that in a situation and say they don't know this or they don't know that but look at your next word he didn't know it himself jesus didn't know it what is the thing that jesus didn't know that only god would know it and he told us when we began to see these signs coming up what is it jesus don't know what's going up 14 80. well that day in an hour noah no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only now pull up the next one that was matthew this is mark 13 32 but of that day and that hour knoweth no man no not the angels which are in heaven neither the son but the father what is it that jesus didn't know one thing he didn't know was his part in the kingdom all right the blood runs after he comes to patmos and begins to write he's beginning to see what's taking place all right but what are those two scriptures talking about they're talking about the coming of the lord see jesus didn't know when he's coming he didn't know the actual date or time of this coming what he said son don't know well now wait a minute brother tell you the ears got us all confused because father's gone holy ghost you won you fought it all together how can one no and does not know that's a revelation that's right it's a revelation so go pray that's not for me to try to interpret or figure out it's for me to have common sense to read you'd say well that was just his flesh okay i'm gonna argue with him but he didn't know when he was coming all right brother said he also didn't know his part in the kingdom until after he come to batman he said god withheld that from him you got to talk to your prophet not me well now look what he goes to on the seventh seal paragraph 394 number 15. now there was some reason that god let the seventh voices be thundered because it must come for we find that christ the lamb took the the book in his hand and he opened the seventh open that seventh seal which is a hidden mystery no one knows it but it's right along with what he said no one would know his coming they would also they also would not know about this seventh under mystery he said it's connected he said he seen it unfold to the seven thunders so now we're talking about the coming of the lord we've already got a scene we've got the end of all things now we got to come into the lord and we've gotten seven thunders because he said they're connected so now he's putting the seven thunders under revelation 8 1. they're in revelations 10 4. right but he's bringing them under revelations 8 1. the thunders the scene the coming of the lord he said they're all connected together he said he seen it unfold if you're looking down here the seven thunders what is the coming of the lord to you well one of these days the skies are going to split and boy we're going to see him descend that's what we used to think right i used to tell you somebody told me i was a kid and i looked around they told me that it'd be a great big cloud look like a number of them i never didn't understand why they told me that but i was still a kid and every time a cloud would come up i'd run out and look and see ain't coming this one he's that stupid well i believed it right right man i mean i was at least looking for something right but you see the coming of the lord now i'm putting this in mind so you'll think then we'll go back to what he's saying i believe and i've always taught you that the second coming of jesus christ started on dead pentecost i believe that right i believe that but that way he can make it something personal to you and i think amen amen because he comes in us in the new birth right right that's right then he could put us like john that's crying out for a deliverer amen wanting these bodies to be delivered explain the situation but one day there will be a completion of those things that's right now remember the seventh seal be in the end of all things so the coming of the lord can be personal and then one day he will come to israel through two prophets that'll be his coming one then in the millennium we'll meet him and that's his coming right yes a lot of things get involved with the coming of the lord a lot of scripture that's why i say that that seven seals broke up from genesis what else could a man say how greater could he have made the statement that he spoke of from genesis all of the scriptures i'm yet to get this money to think about it right around said jesus spoke more of his second coming than he did of his first coming right remember the kingdom the mothers wanting to sit one on one side on the other all of the scripture is unveiling the coming of the lord spoke of but he started his second coming on the dead in the new birth let's just read a few things and then we'll quit go ahead number 16. let me read pretty fast god's great mystery christ mr god revealed program 106. god's great mystery how it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody knows nothing about me and the angels didn't understand he didn't reveal it that's the reason on earth seventh mystery when the seventh seal was open there was silence jesus when he was here on earth they wanted to know when he would come he said it's not even the son himself don't know when it's going to happen see god has this all to himself it's a secret and that's the reason there were silence in heaven perspective half hour and seven thunders under their voices and john was even forbidden to write it see the coming of the lord that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he will come and when he will come it's a good thing that he doesn't look at 17. program 155 of the souls that are in prison now the lamb has redeemed it but he could not come forth until every name was revealed and that was taking place was taking place under the sixth seal before the seventh room then the spotless lamp came for what he had redeemed as you read that read that line over and you see what the seventh seal is that's right that's why it's not revealing some rejective form right if all names are reeled under sixth seal that's redemptive what's he doing then the lamb came for what he had redeemed that's what he's coming in this end time for yes for what he redeemed at calvary which is body spirit soul of mankind right come to claim what he had redeemed you when he gave me the new birth that only made the soul and lay claim on the body listen he's already got it right here in the book taking it from his hands now he's coming to receive what he has redeemed that's his work he's done he's going to receive it oh what a time that's proven in the seventh seal proved it come back and took the book of redemption amen what took the book of redemption brother after the lamb number seven seal right what do you say right so the seventh seal must be the lamb right right the lamb must be the seventh seal let's put it that way that's why jesus preached six seals and never said a thing about the settlement why because that's who he was or either where you want to put it what he was or any way you want to bring that terminology he was the seventh seal he still is that soon that's right but he's coming to redeem now this is what everybody likes go to number eight uh 19. everybody likes this statement you know to use which is the feast of the trumpets burger 175. 176 says that the seventh seal hasn't broke yet you know that's just coming well see that ain't broke but he done told you the seal was broken it's coming they make manufacturing right it's begun in the new birth and it'll never be revealed to the public that's right so we'll read that number 20. now we have in the completion here now by the grace of god all the mysteries are the six seals that's been sealed and we understand and know here that that seventh seal is not to be known to the public now it's coming and the hour is coming when the destruction of the world only it's out of the end it's not to be known to the public but now have you caught on to one thing the reason seven is the end of all things because the number seven is completion right that's right number seven is completion right but it can't be anything other than that part of an article look at this next from the seventh seal number 21. see israel's gathering in our own homeland but you noticed he omitted the set revealing this seven minute omitted the revelation of the seventh seal and year when the seventh seal when it opened he also admitted omitted it again so we see that it is a complete mystery therefore the hour is not yet for these these mystery to be known all right therefore we know that we're we're look therefore we're this far and the rest of it will be known right around about the time that jesus appears on earth again for his bride or whatever takes place at that time all right see don't try to figure it out just go and pray go to the license 22 feast of the trumpets program 147. because the seventh seal there was silence no one knew that was a minute or hour that christ would come as he revealed to us the seventh seal then there's a lot of things the same as the end of all times it's the thunders it's the coming of the see lord now let me end it with these words [Music] we are not just to be talking about the second coming thank you now forgive me for being plain but just i'm throwing off them no church or not but you know how we used to believe we used to preach about the coming of the holy ghost of the day of pentecost but we never related ourselves back to very much and if you ask a good baptist to express to you about the new birth and he'll tell you that i've got the holy ghost because they come on their pentecost go talk with people just just leave them up to a little mount for you when it comes to their pentagon well i don't mean you now i'm gonna be in there and i'm a trainer because we owe more than that you get my point i'm a millionaire could have gotten a bite it's just not my name my bible said that my god owned the cattle on a thousand heels that's right right and i said it young's the taters too [Music] you know it's all mine i just don't have the ability to receive it right the day you receive the new birth god laid plain on these bodies well you're not going to get a new one it's going to be this body redeemed now we're coming to the position that we should be saying i'm redeemed meaning the body the word that god can bring it into reality amen but you see i'm not looking for the coming of the lord i've been watching that for a long time right because the coming of the lord according to my understanding is not a corporal physical coming back here to take us out so the seventh seal wouldn't be dealing with a corporal body of jesus christ to stand on earth he would be dealing as the things the prophet would say that he becomes so visible among us that he'll raise the dead and we'll go in the rapture not a physical corporal type of thing but a revelation of god's word now the life statement then when the word is revealed now not letters we've been through all today about the letter of it the oral roberts university could have everything of brother brown and could make you a speech you'll never see but they know nothing about the coming of the lord right other than the easter sky split the thing happens coming down you know and we know that's not going to happen that way see then they could they missed his first coming because they had it figured out how it had to be could we miss his second coming that's right by trying to figure out something see people are saying to me about you bro brother dale don't you think we're gonna have more signs and wonders if we're talking about these things i told you a long time ago you don't believe it i can start on a series tomorrow and preach week after week on divine healing and bring in the manifestation i didn't say to me manifestation of healings will come into being and even if we could get this body totally made new right there's no rapture amen well you want to type come on abraham and sarah were made young but they weren't raptured that's right that's why it said we'd be changed in the moment the twinkling of an eye yes the prophet of god said if it was just his body made young he said that won't work it's got to be made eternal the revealed word is the only thing i know that could change you and i wouldn't it be wonderful to drop back and be 18 years old but now just as i was talking about it i could preach divine healing and it will come into manifestation i know you don't like the way i talk i'm sorry i'd rather stay 72 years old then you'll be 18. i don't want to go back there that's right right here man if it takes all age and sickness to bring on the coming of the lord because i don't mean that is what causes it that's right i didn't say that right but if we went back there i'd have to get 72 again that's right and i don't want it i don't think so wouldn't it be great to have no more hurt i tried to explain that sister regina caught onto something about it began to express it you didn't have a temperature in your body you'd die right you didn't have a temperature to develop in your body to show you that there's something wrong you would die right man the temperature then we want to fight the temperature right and i'm come on honestly anybody wants to get rid of it come on we're sensible but the temperature is telling you something wrong somewhere else you're treating the symptom that's right you're treating the temperature by a chemical reaction upon the body by an aspirin or something and ain't doing a bit of good to what you got is that right right i want to deal with what's causing me to have a temperature you know look at that straight now temperature automatically go money you see church the opening of the word is the coming of the lord the word being revealed to you and i is the coming of the lord that's right he said yeah but i want to see the physical well that's wonderful so do i but somebody's got to get the revelation what's going on why can't it be us amen that's right and say i'm redeemed amen come on brother my love did mine glory glory christ is mine you see church the great men that i've been speaking of in the bible the greatest writer of them all the apostle paul in summing up his revelation and things in the book of corinthians he said we see not all things under his feet remember that yes oh what do you mean he put out everything daddy paul said we don't see everything under his feet but he said we see jesus go back over in the writings and he said the last enemy to be destroyed he's dead brother says we're still dying so that effect is still here all i want is for him to come in me and do what he's doing back in he raised that body up from the grave amen that's right he made that body eternal and went sailing through this guy until that happens we're gonna die i see jesus i see him with the word the angels out there for brother brown when they're looking down he said that was jesus christ looking down from heaven they didn't tell him those seagulls out there in arizona he says he didn't they told him to go home he would be made known right he comes into the breach and then god in simplicity and he says i don't know what that first deal is now you just made him a liar if you think he did he got into the first hill he said i don't know what that second seal is do we believe him or is our dependence upon something we can concoct of our own selves well i think it's this well good that means your brain's working the worst revelation he destroyed death amen but you and i are gonna have to destroy it that's right that's right i can't destroy death i agree with you we can't but we can destroy the effects that it has we can quit dropping and complaining about what situations we're in of sicknesses and things that's right but around says satan's got a hand they gotta push at you you gotta find out what that is and cover it that's right great man that god bragged over said he was perfect satan you can handle you just can't take his life what is the seventh seal to you and i a lot of things about silence in heaven so the prophet has already told us some things now we got another message to get on in this and then we'll get into some things that he says that it was to him now what do you say it is to you mustang what do you say it is to you i might not see it all but i see jesus amen let me preach what i see until something comes forth i see jesus made a little lower than the angels for suffering for you and i was withholding it he didn't even know when he was coming but the prophet said after he went to patents didn't he you you wouldn't withhold it from jesus on batman it was withholding john jesus knew exactly what do we need to worry about the time or the hour right that's figuring out the 30 minutes of cybertron what good would it do it's like i told you you can say what you want to argue what you want to i ain't worried about it you'll say it's true if we know he was coming tomorrow at two o'clock we'd be goofing off in the morning now don't tell me that you'd know he's coming at the end of the week and then all week long just i ain't eating i ain't taking him out i'm gonna sit right here no that's why god done it that way to keep us looking that's why i always say to your sisters that's why i don't preach clothes and dress and hair like everybody else that i preach in your birth but sisters if you look in that mirror and are not condemned over what you wear but if you see something in there that don't look too good you got a problem let me preach about it screaming holler just tell you like it is right you can't fake that mirror it's only reflecting what it's looking in what's your point why shouldn't we live to where that any second we could turn around then jesus would be standing there not a corporal body but him be standing there would we be ashamed human mortals yes but not ashamed because he's standing there because he'd have to remember one thing if he's standing there you ain't lost right right everything can be taken care of what do we got we will try 288 in the red folks ladies anybody have a need oh [Music] is huh oh me oh is is foreign oh oh [Music] one day he said it like this he said i'm not saying he's coming he said i'm saying he's here now that means a whole lot of difference you're gonna go home sometimes they just get a dictionary and just look up the words c-o-m-a are coming look it up my first surprise have no reference to someone out there coming up here [Music] no reference it's not travel you think well you tell me so brother once you come down to the house that's human terminology but that's not the word come the word khan literally means standing here you ain't got a thing in the world to do with how long it takes me to get to your house you're not concerned about what car i drove if i walked or rode a bicycle run you're concerned with me standing in your presence that's what the word come mean it means it's literal presence that's not a parousia presence his presence in here [Music] oh oh [Music] a little baby oh he's not coming he's here because he's not traveling a distance see that's what our mind and mentality is still like i thought he went up maybe you don't believe the second coming starting the day of pentecost but i thought he went up and come back you know did i miss it he went up he came back on the day of pentecost but i just always looked at it as a change of these bodies and things we gotta get to a place [Music] everything is dependent on whether or not you and i can quit plugging around and get out of seriousness paraphrasing this word [Music] see it's going to be our witnesses we'll make sure we got the opportunity thank you for your word thank you for you we know and realize we're looking at the eternal god fulfilling his word walking among us to manifest himself among us and lord just one split second we could be there and no problem so why is the problem of our life so much just happens to walk in you forgive our sins cleanse us and guide us let your love be their father we thank you in jesus name amen you just blessed prayer foreign
