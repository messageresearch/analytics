sometimes they're wandering out in the path of sin and they might be there's somebody looking out for amen I love that quote where brother Branham said what I'm sorry yes sir hope realizes who to ride with him yes Hallelujah one thing I love about brother Brown said one time he said you know what he said some old grandma a long time ago got on her knees and touched God right and he said save my children my grandchild and my great grandchildren amen you know what we'll be able to thank that person because you'll be able to know that over there you'll be connected with how you got here and you will absolutely see that God had his hand in everything that we do right where do we we're serving him at the moment or not he was right there with us because he said he'll never leave us our forsaken Gloria so if you got your Bibles let's turn to the book of second Corinthians just from real kind of a short thought tonight but something that's been bearing on my heart and we're we're starting in the Sunday school class on a study on Christianity what a subject yeah Christianity without saying brother Branham said yeah come on come on I'm gonna tell you something there's gonna be more people in heaven that don't know brother Brown then do oh my there's going to be born again Christians now I'm not be christianizing him at all or saying that we don't need him I'm just telling you if we don't live a christ-like life forget about what William Brown said right amen just be plain all right second Corinthians 3 verse 1. let's bow our head before we get started Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for this evening it's time that we come out and set aside for you Lord we truly thank you and we're just joking there about the aspartame but we we know that there's a God that healed all of our diseases Even in our stupidity the things that we do wrong in life you're there with us Lord you said you'd never leave us you'd never forsake us and I depend on that whether I can feel you or whether I can see you or whether I know you're even there father I have to believe that you're there with him and I pray that each one tonight will will feel that that you are there with them and and truly be satisfied that they come to the house of the Lord to hear from you Lord and not from a man and not from a person but from the person the man Christ Jesus good Lord you're the one that went to the cross and died for our sins you're the one that took all of our shame and took all of our stripes and took all of our worries and Lord if we just lay them on you father what a better life would have probably after to be with each one lord it's not here tonight the ones that are sick to be with him Lord thank you for healing the ones that have been out for a while Lord we we thank you for raising them up we pray Lord that you would just keep back all the enemy all the sickness all this stuff is hey they say it's airborne and they say it's touching or yeah that doesn't mean a thing to you Lord you can clean us off and make us whole and I pray that you do that father to the ones that are not here and the ones that are here tonight Lord be with each one take care of the missionaries on a foreign field be running Noel Johnson Lord send an email join us telling us where he was and brother George Quinn those two come to mind Lord because they sent us a report and Lord it's a it's a good report that these brothers can get out and and go to these foreign countries and just be with them and give them fruit for their labor father forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes and our ideas that are against you Lord bless this day and keep us safe we ask these things in Jesus name amen I know I think Terrence announced it but the fellowship meeting we're leaving Saturday at my house at 10 30. I'm probably not going to get to go but June's going to go but uh 10 30 Saturday and I need your daddy's house or my house one of the two so and remember me next Friday I'll be flying to Kansas for a week I'll be there for Sunday and Wednesday service at brother pinkson so I'll be gone for a few days just keep us in your prayers and uh probably go see brother Claude I talked to him last night he said tell everyone hello and he's feeling a lot better himself amen he's back to his old self he's grumpy so Second Corinthians 3 verse 1. Dewey began again to commend ourselves or need we as some other Epistles of commendation to you are letters of accommodation from you you are our epistle now that word epistle means what letter you are our letter written in our hearts not our own piece of paper known and read of all men that doesn't say just all saints that Center in Saint all right for as much as you are manifestly declared to be that's my manifestation manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US Written not within but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in flexially tables of the heart and such trust we through Christ to godward not that we are sufficient of ourselves that's our problem right we think we got something to do with it okay we not that we are sufficient of ourselves do you think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God Amen who also hath made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life you may be seated in the Lord and his Blessing to the reading of the word I don't know brother Jason Jackson call me today and or sent me a taxes and asked me was I preaching to a piece list and then I got it down now in my computer so I'm okay I can handle it they've been trying to get me to bring my computer up here and do it on do the uh sermon on a computer like the big name Preachers did but I'm not a big name preacher so I'll just leave mine on paper and I still believe in bringing the old book up here too now I still believe in that book I I uh they saw me at work today in the last few days that Mom and Dad gave me this book in 1998 and right it's about wore out so I'm transferring like Daddy used to do with his so I'm only in numbers no Deuteronomy so it's going to take probably about two or three months to get down to the end of the 66 books of the Bible of all the things that I've got written that I'm going to transfer over to my new Bible but I'm going to use the one that brother Jeff's tremel gave me in 2007 so I'm gonna switch over to that that Bible so but that Bible is uh it's precious to me I'll always keep it right now the in the Greek Lexicon we're going to see if you'll put him up Joe will brother Joe will start that the word if Strong's that epistle is a letter all right so Paul's saying ye are our letter written in our hearts now listen to the first quote brother Brown said hit the hidden life with Christ now we're gonna we're gonna probably not be very long but that's okay I'm gonna I'm gonna hit some points but I want you to realize that that Sunday school we're going to start it's it's Christianity and I don't want people to get the wrong impression especially out on the internet that that we believe in Christianity outside of the message of the hour but I believe that you can get born again right right Ram said you put an egg under a dog right and it'll hatch but once that thing hatches it knows it's an eagle it's going to go to Mama right right the dog's not the mama anymore it's going to go to Mama Eagle so I I believe that I believe that we have come to a place and and if if I walk up and down your toes and you just move them or leave them out there but I'm talking to every one of you everybody asks me a lot of times bro Martin didn't answer well what are you preaching on tonight I said you yeah who else you're preaching to right preaching to you so listen get in life with Christ Minneapolis Minnesota oh and the the theme downstairs in our Sunday school class is going to be leaving me a sermon yeah big man sir man right Don't Preach me one lend me one man and that's where all we're all fail but you know what we got to get to that right God didn't put you here to work in a factory just alone he puts you here as a testimony a written epistle right of all men to live an honorable and decent life and a hid consecrated life with God so that men would know that Jesus Christ still lives and Reigns amen amen that's a little Pinchy but it's good now look up that word Pinchy you won't find it but the prophet used is good enough for me it'll help your digesting order orders you know to take the food right amen it'll fit you into a place where that you can receive healing for both soul and body amen now see I've been doing it now I I don't use yellow highlighter and I like that blue so it kind of brings it out a little bit but now look the god intend for the Bible to be written Adam did not need a guidebook right Adam didn't go looking for the Book of Genesis it wasn't written it actually wasn't written because Moses wrote it way over all right now what God want God wanted to live life right Adam was the example he was the example human he didn't need a reference guide to have the mind of Christ no when the Holy Ghost came and indwelled that man he had the mind of Christ now we know that he fell and we know that he fell from from continuing on to be the one to bring you and me and you into being but still he still had the mind of God he didn't lose that I don't believe at the time of the Fall I don't believe he went from a saying to a sinner and thought like a sinner after the fall no he continued to have the mind of Christ he just couldn't do any he couldn't get those Clues got stopped up the blues got stopped up and he couldn't operate because what happened enmity division right in his brain he couldn't do the things that he used to do because remember he was now afraid that's right that fear had not come upon him until the fall came and he didn't he didn't he didn't disobey his wife he disobeyed what God Said right all right and then of course he tried to pass the buck we know that but having the mind of Christ he could do things that you and I he lived a life that was exemplary he was uh he was the example son before the fall when he could say Let There Be move this here put this over here name all the animals now if we fell from that that's what we fell from the national position we got to go back to amen right not a lower position to where that can't happen no it's got to be the same position through the second Adam got to bring that back and restore it to Fellowship where you and I can talk to God faith to Faith amen that's right face to face right I don't even have a problem walking up to the Almighty said hey Daddy how are you today that's right brother Brown would say son how was it today oh Dad we walked through the garden and you know me and my wife we walked through the garden had a wonderful time we don't want that's what's going to happen to you and I right when we get all this sin curse out of the way and get all that stuff going but you know what I read them a quote in The Minister's meeting that brother Brown said God will become so visible Among Us right yeah that's right that he would raise the damn and going to Rapture amen amen become so visible among us alone that's it now we're not going to see the physical man like Adam did come on but where are we gonna see him come on each other then where are we that's right how far up the road are we blessing people in the in the New Testament just with the faith of the fathers just with the faith of the fathers you know man would walk by in the shadow of that man will heal from right amen that's right exactly the shadow of that man now that you don't have to get that out of a quote book all right you can't go try to find that somewhere Peter that Peter didn't say silver and gold have my number let me look in first Corinthians no because it wasn't written right or let me go look in the Old Testament I mean my word I was thinking today when when you went to that what was one I can't remember his name that was in the book of Acts that was preaching that Jesus was the Christ out of the Old Testament was it that's the Cornelius who was it I forgot his name but anyway remember he says have you Paul comes and have you a fever Holy Ghost since you believe Paul comes and tell him a Polish now look Apollos without the new birth right without the quickening of the word right to the degree of a holy ghost-filled person he did not have the Holy Ghost just in a Sanctified condition he was taking the Old Testament and proving that Jesus was God Amen right without the Holy Ghost exactly preach but then Paul comes along he says have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe this right and you know what they said we didn't know whether there be a holy ghost in other words they was preaching all this right they never heard of that right right come on brother blessing I know this is hard but it's gonna beat every one of us how are we gonna get up here when we don't have it down here right that's right the simple things right the Ten Commandments when Moses came on Earth Moses did not have the Ten Commandments he did not know one thing about the Ten Commandments right he delivered two million people two million people right out of the land of Egypt without the Sith the Lord in prayer yeah right amen he just walked up and said God said God said to me I'm telling you right and he did say that saith the Lord but it wasn't something written down that he could hand pharaoh and say look God told me to tell you this no he walked up there and even God told him said you be God that's right Aaron's going to be your Prophet I'm going to tell you and you tell Aaron right because if you're reading the Bible Moses is not the one that used the rod Moses told Aaron what to do and Aaron went and done it a type of what we're supposed to do we're supposed to believe our prophet and we're supposed to take what the prophet said take that staff and take it to the people or take it to the devil right but now watch those Ten Commandments you know anybody think of God 1964 614 we've quoted this many times before but I want you to see something here I'm just going to kind of take it a little slower I know they they accuse me of preaching too fast when I was in a Minister's meeting so I'm going to slow down a little bit remember before the true message came forth before the true message came forward right Moses preached and he led them out of Egypt but there before the real Commandments was laid down he said the sales was brought in so the sales are part of the Redemptive plan right the Ten Commandments all right but now they weren't written until God gave them to Moses all right God came down before the people and proved that Moses was sent from him that's right in a pillar of fire that Moses said he'd seen that bush he talked to him now look before that God did not want to give them the Ten Commandments on two sheets of right of stone he told Moses he said Moses because see he was in Horeb when he saw the burning bush backs out of the desert he was with um Jeff Roman and doing all that and then he went to Egypt and God said bring them back to this mountain and I will talk to them not write it down all right I will talk to them just like I'm talking to you Moses I will talk to them right right but now what happened when Moses went up there they said Moses you go we'll stay down here whatever God tells you that's what we'll do well they lied there oh yeah but that's what brother Brown said they didn't know what they got but they got God in letter form right called The Ten Commandments right all right which was their Redemption that was their Redemption right oh sure it was the bullets in The Oxen The Killing but that was all in that Ten Commandments Thou shalt not Thou shalt not look at all hey I've been going through um Genesis Exodus Leviticus and been around me the past three days pretty much reading everything that I used to underline a long time ago so I've been reading it over again do this don't do this do this don't do this I gotta do the vow do the vow this do the vow that Feast of Pentecost and do this and that and the other but that was gone in letter form but Redemption doesn't come from words on a page right right Redemption does not come from words on page amen amen it comes from the fleshly tables of your heart my heart all of our heart Redemption is you becoming the word amen right not the word becoming you right we want the word to fit us we want the word to fit this yeah but no no we got to be conformed to the word that's right right we got to be conformed to His Image amen be conformed to the person because you know what it's like um brother Tim was saying you know it's a person right it's a person that we're looking for not words it's a person that we're looking for right Redemption is not Pages or or books or forms or quotes right redemptions of Revelation amen amen he doesn't mind if I wrote a revelation I had down and give it to brother Donnie or give it to any one of you all right half of you wouldn't understand it and that doesn't make the Revelation wrong exactly right right right because like brother Tim Calhoun did he did a good job of it when we were having a ministers meeting he took a piece of paper that had the words of Silent Night on it but he tore them up in a different place and he gave them out to the pastors and told them said each one of us has our own piece of paper right but when they come together they got to make the words of Silent Night not Away in a Manger right so we each have our part to do you've got your part you may not I couldn't understand what was on mine I can read the part of it but somebody else could right that was a good analogy all right because there are levels of understanding but we need to find those levels and we need to get in them we don't need to be well we'll talk about in just a minute but let's go to Ephesians 1 7. because here is redemption in whom we have Redemption through his blood right not through words on a paper right the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace I love what brother Jason said if y'all didn't get listen to it um the watch not service he talks about repentance you say we're bro now we're past that are we he said repent means to quit doing what you're doing right that's right and turn and go in the other direction right right repent it's not to say I'm sorry all right well that's right amen not to say I'm sorry right think about it the Bible says Godly sorrow right you got to be sorry for what you did right and that leads you to repentance amen right that's the problem in the Old Testament they weren't sorry yeah they were just sorry yeah and that's the thing that we are we're not just sorry we're sorry yeah we're sorry a bunch of people but we have Redemption to its highest degree amen right that's it we're at the Apex of redemption right but to let her killeth every time you read that it's going to change you one way or the other right Better or Worse right every time you walk in here and every time you leave every time you hear the word preach you're either going to be better right are you going to be a worker right amen right and what's worse worse may not mean it's you think less of the Lord you have the Lord on your mind all the time I think somebody I you know this is just me I don't listen to a lot of tapes because I don't like listening I'd rather read so I read a lot of books so I don't listen to a lot but you know sometimes I I accuse brother Timbo and I know he doesn't mind me telling my cute Brother Timbo we we were traveling together when we worked with parents and get sticked up headphones in his ears and he'd listen to a tape over and over and over all day all day all day and I said Tim you need less than something else every once in a while because that could be repetition yeah right that's not going to drive the devil away that's right if you're doing that just not just the devil the way that ain't gonna drive the devil away right right no you got to realize that you gotta listen to what's being said right and Let It Drop from here to here because the letter kills from here right but the spirit gives life that's what he said right the letter kill it you're supposed to listen to what the spirit says to the churches yeah not the letter what the spirit says to the churches let's go to Hebrews chapter 5. a quote here in 1957. and I'm just going to read you a few things only got about 10 quotes We're Not Gonna Be We're not gonna be low and it was the same in the Old Testament but Paul being well trained and knew the scriptures by the word but you see the scriptures no matter how well you know them if the spirit doesn't Quicken them then the letter Kelly that's what the Ten Commandments did in the Old Testament it killed those people right right the letter killed them it condemned them every single day because there was no Spirit to get in those people to where they could live what they were reading that's right right all right but that's not so now unless you don't have the spirit right and then the letter will kill you the spirit giveth life see it must be quickened or Made Alive by the spirit if the spirit doesn't live in the word and make it a reality to you then the letter is just intellectual right that's right and it's not but well let me let me read the rest of the quote that's where we have so many confessed Christians today our professed Christian is that intellectual conception of Christ right but now look what we were talking about a few minutes ago in the book of Acts that man had an intellectual conception of the Old Testament and could preach Christ to the people right exactly right but if he would have continued on that way that letter would have killed him and not the Spirit come because of them you should receive Holy Ghost since you believe and man when they were filled with the Holy Ghost man they went out signs and wonders and doing things and doing things of God so we can hear all the word we want to and that's what I want to caution each and every let's go to this next quote and they don't want to make a statement believe it or not is what God put on my heart there's a man here that can turn on the light so life is only by the word of God made manifest life comes only by the word of God made manifest right as long as it's just in the book like this it still can be questioned exactly but when it's made manifest and you see the product of what it spoke of right the Old Testament couldn't produce the product right Christ had to come produce the product and then had to come back in me and you to practice it right but when it's made manifest and you see the product of what it spoke of being manifested then that is light on the word see that's what brings the word said so and then when it comes to pass that is life and light light bringing Life Light brings life amen right right so that's what we got to do I told myself here I said stop and I want to caution each and every one of us because my goal this year is to get closer to God Amen right and it's getting closer to God I hope I can draw you closer to God right that's what I was telling the ministers the other day I don't I I don't come to see brother Gerald Hughes or I don't come to see brother so and so when we have ministers meeting I have you on my mind you the Bible says Hebrews then I tell them Hebrews 13 11 says we watch for your soul we're a Watchman that watches over your soul brother you know why can't watch over your own yeah exactly wow I got some old memes but no amens on that one your sheep we're sheep when I say weed but I mean all of us we're sheep we have to be led amen amen that's just the way we are that's why there is do's and don'ts to this yeah but it's the tender hand of Jehovah it brings it and tells it to where it's supposed to be called but stop trying to figure this thing out right I'm telling every one of you stop trying to know something that somebody else don't know right I told you on Sunday's good class stop it right that's intellectual that's not the devil don't try to be a preacher right okay right don't try to be a preacher huh don't try to figure it out right right stop it I'm saying it again stop it you'll get ahead of God that's right yeah you'll get ahead of this program exactly sure the prophet said he said I've seen scrap heaps of ministers what going out above God's program right ahead of God can you get ahead of God treat him yeah that means you're out of the world God right right that's right so let's stop it stop trying to figure this thing out right because you're only going to get an intellectual conception of it and you're going to do just like the preachers do when we have ministers meeting we have ministers meetings and I'm sorry preachers we're just like that somebody brings a quote and we go off in that direction trying to either prove it right or prove it wrong yeah oh yeah sorry you do the same thing yeah you don't get a call oh here you'll get something over here you'll get this over here right quit this just folks will be the time of rest amen this is Ruth resting right this is the resting time while our Boaz does the right of redemption right which is the Holy Ghost right amen let him do the work in your life let him quit cry no human being ever is going to figure this thing out Friday man that's why the letter kill it you can write it down and you can bring dissertation after dissertation After books this thick all you want to never going to figure out what God's plan is exactly but you got to be a part of God's plan amen all right Matthew 6 verse 31. I know we read these sometimes when we come up to the day then where we're the squeezing and we don't have you know no what about now take no thought right take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink you ain't got in trouble doing that you kept asking by the time Ernest what do you all doing what are y'all drink whatever drink want to drink he emailed back he said Bud Light that stopped her he told you all that while he was here the other day so he don't mind me telling it but what shall we eat what should we drink or or whether All Shall we be clothed this is Bible right Matthew 10 verse 19 but when they deliver you up take no thought how We're not gonna have time to get our quotes together amen that's right but when they deliver you up take no thought how or what you shall say or speak for it shall be given you in that same hour that you shall speak right amen now how many really believe that amen better believe it here's Kate go back to Matthew 6 verse 33. this is our problem but seek ye first the kingdom of God right and all these things shall be added unto you all these things what keep my Commandments do all those things seek the kingdom of God first and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you John 14 15. see if you love me right three plane in it if you love me keep my Commandments that's right he said if you love me figure me out right he said if you love me keep what I've already said right amen per sample right resist the devil and he'll flee from you that's pretty powerful but pretty simple all right God put the provision in this word Glory we've got to believe what that word says right we've got to become believers John 14 16. and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever right even the spirit of Truth he said oh I'm worried about get the Holy Ghost right yeah the Holy Ghost and he'll lead you into truth amen my dad said you may have got the holy ghost in the Pentecostal Church Presbyterian church but where you at now right you're at the word you're going to come to the word you're not going to say once you hear the word a message exactly it's gonna click and it's gonna draw you to that right because the word cannot say something the spirit doesn't say all right all right so let's not be scared let's not let's let's not be so because remember nine times out of ten in the prayer line if you will listen to what rotherham's saying he uses the word nervous thousands of times you're just nervous right you're nervous about something and it's got your heart fluttering it's got your body you get nervous and I promise you one thing ain't no drug going to help you right right man call this nerve is she it's where is it coming from though thoughts in your mind right right you can't do that you're the only one who can change those thoughts in your mind right man God can change for us all right I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive so yes we do have something the world cannot receive right right but it's because they don't have the Holy Ghost and we do whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not right it understandeth him not but it doesn't see him either the only way it's going to see is through who me and you right neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you amen let's skip on down to John 14 25 these things have I spoken unto you being yet present with you but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost and the father will send in my name he shall teach you so he's trusting intellect of a hold of you know that God hold up he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance said how many times have you been talking to somebody and they walk off and you go I should have said how many times have we done it before I had the quote brother around me I didn't bring it with me but he said how many times have you done that and he said God didn't want you to say it right right exactly and you're going like but brother dick bro dick it would help them it would help them if we'd have just said that that's right amen then why don't we trust what he said come all right that's right Ruth's resting read that we always love the light of redemption but Boyce told you she'll well you know where where Ruth is at she's sitting resting right waiting on him to finish because you know what she couldn't help him one bit right Ruth could not help Boaz do anything right she just waited until he did it right then when he did it he took her and said I receive you unto myself right and I'll marry you and we'll have children and then it went to do there like a bride in Christ but the comforter which is the only ocean the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things yeah that's right all things right amen life marriage business pleasure where we left him out yeah probably about all four no but teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I've said unto you right because what I've said unto you brother it may not be the same thing I said in the sister Gail because she's not required to know what you know right but it's what I said unto you right you read that he didn't say what I said I hope everybody answer what I said unto you personal revelation is you and God Amen as one right right it's between you and God glory and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you let's just say I don't understand better than I don't believe right because remember and here's what I want you to listen to what I'm saying because we are blessed and I'm not putting myself above nobody else but we are blessed to have some good teachers right and the Bible said a brother around said teaching places you in the body now so from now on it's easy now but in a few minutes I'm gonna get right where he's sitting well I'm gonna let the prophet do it because he does a lot better than I do but where are we going to come to the place to where God I know this is where you want me right here amen and I'm going to have the manifestation around me right that's what placing you in the body is all right amen if you're the finger don't try to be the tone right if you're the finger say God I know where you put me I'm right here I'm right here this is what I'm supposed to do I believe this is what I'm supposed to do so I just told him the other day I'd love to do this every day I can do this right here every day of my life but the pay is not very good yeah so but I'd love to do it but I do it without getting paid but something about a mortgage you have to worry about yeah every once in a while so but you know what I like to see people's lives changed I like to see people grow I like to see the the maturity and the sparkling eye instead of looking at people you know you can and everybody has their place in the 504 minutes let me kind of walk on eggshells here everybody's got their place in a fightful Ministry but in evangelist he can come in he can get the will of God which he does get the will of God and I mean if he's a true holy ghost film my brother 40 and some of the other ones he can come in and he can Bam Bam Bam and either he can make you feel so good right and that's good right because he is telling you the truth sure and you're supposed to take that right but you know what I'm going to read your quote in a few minutes brother Robson it doesn't matter how much you dance how much you shout how much you sing in the spirit how much you run the aisles he said the devil don't care about that right he said but when he sees that life right reflect out through you he can't handle that right right so that's okay to have all the bubble dances and it's okay to have all that but you know it comes down to where God I know where I am when the bride realizes who she is and what she's doing here her position exactly that's when we're going to be an invincible Army not that we know all this up here nobody knows this down here exactly that's our problem people I hear it from a lot of you and I don't like it you try to be way up him forget about being way up here if God puts you up here that's cool amen but if you put yourself up here you're just going off let them out I mean you just but remember brother Ryan said don't jump so high let's read quote now we're going to get into the closet once more Lord because I'm not here for just the clap hands and shout and run up and down the aisle oh I believe in that sure but there's more than that to it it's got to have a foundation for this you see I believe that when you jump when you come back down live hot live then live as high as you jump right right and if you don't don't jump right see so then just always jump as high as you live man now that's what we should do because after all your life speaks louder than your testimony right you know the people know what you are by the way you live and the things you do right amen all right let's go to the next one foreign series and he's trying to bring a group of people into adoption right right but what's he having to cover in the very first one number one paragraph 54 right at the beginning of all the adoption series he said and there's where the church is failing today on that walk yeah do you know that even your own behavior can knock somebody else out of getting healed right exactly your misbehavior of unconfessed Sins Of You believers much less to unbelievers than the make-believers right can cause this church to bitterly fail right and at the day of judgment you'll be responsible for every bit of it oh you shall now wait a minute brother around well that's the truth right think of it yeah all right let's go to the next one Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever 1961. and then as we are Sons and Daughters of God and join ours with him in the Kingdom then we express him in our lives sometimes if many of us would just live our sermons instead of preaching it yeah I think it'd be better if we just go ahead and live the sermon you know it's a lot better to live me one than it is to preach me one I I believe because I can see your life Our Lives are and people know us no matter our actions is so loud it drowns Our Testimony right right depends on what we say right that's right if we are Christians and don't live it then people know better right but we are Christians and say we're Christians and live like Christians Our Lives will do it if we never said nothing else right you never said a word that word right wow Our Lives we are written Epistles read of all men I want to emphasize that it doesn't say just random Christians yeah he said read them all men so they watch how you walk and I was thinking the other day about being sealed by the Holy Spirit a seal is Mark listen what he explains this remember the seal on the front side and the back side right right which way he brings us out a seal is marked on both sides they see you coming and they see you going right look like a Christian coming you look like a Christian going so when you're so going so when you're sealed by the holy spirit amen all right let's go to the next one well it's getting quiet now I don't hear many amens you know it's the truth people that's right right the only God this World's Gonna See Is You and Me bro exactly if we have God at all yeah and now you know many people won't go to church they say well they've got a wrong impression of church yeah the men are black Rogue demons and they just got the wrong idea about it but I'll tell you what they do do they'll watch your life to see what you do right bro that's right I believe it was policy we were renting Epistles of God read them all men when you're on the street when you're at your work wherever you are somebody is watching you right and especially after you said and made your confession that you're a Christian right buddy I just witnessed they're really going to watch that's right they'll watch you much closer then and that gives an influence to the people that surround you and we should watch what we do because if we produce the wrong influence then we'd bring reproach not so much upon ourselves but upon what we claim to be right right Christians we bring it upon amen Christ right right that's the man that's it right and no one remember what brother Brown saw the invasion of of you know Jesus's head you know when something hit his head in the blood and fly this way remember he saw the vision he was going to condemn that woman and then the angel said that's what your sins are doing to him right we bring it upon Christ and and no one if we would think you would never want to bring our coach upon Christ but the wrong act at the wrong time will certainly call the wrong reflection toward the person that's watching you and everybody is watched when you profess to be a Christian amen right everybody watches your room let's go the next one you know what you know what the world is depending on you to be a Christian right amen whether they express it whether they ever say it because in Revel in Romans 8 it says the whole world is groaning and waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God the whole world the whole creation we will see Jesus that's the reason Christians I think it's so real tonight that we should live the right kind of a life because you see there's many people won't take time to read the Bible but they'll read you you're right see you're a written Epistle of God a real true born-again Christian is the word expressed again that's what Paul was saying you're writing Epistles you're expressing what I am preaching right all right because you're written Epistles of God red of all men what type of person should we be we can be if we know that our lives is an open Living Bible to the unbeliever to express God in our own life I told you many times I told you many times the thing that struck me more than anything is I wanted to live a life like that man right there false fails whatever don't worry about that I saw Christ and I know you guys at General Motors did too he was working his everyday life sure they might have been times when we all kind of you know get our props knocked out from under speed you know what it's the everyday life the everyday living sure you're going to have your ups and downs it's kind of like Investments you're going to have real good days and real bad days just pray that the good days are more than the bad day right right all right same way with anything you you got to be somewhere is what I'm saying somewhere you got to see that this is where you're at right your position and that's my goal this year to at least find my position I can't find yours right but we can try our best to preach you to your position right try to give you and you know help let God be available where he can work because remember it's a one-on-one between you and him amen all right yeah you can come here and you can listen but remember what brother Brown said we're the the only thing we do is we bring to your remembrance what God Said right try to break the scales back the spell that Satan's put on your eyes all through the week that's why I'm in it every church service I need scales took off mines I don't like missing them right I like being here because it takes a scales off the eye so you can see what God's already said about you this is not some new function right right that's right number 10. Mighty God unveiled before it's 1964 Moses Bale he was the Living Word to the people and today the people that are veiled are the same thing they are written Epistles realm all men not a new epistle that's what our problem is we don't want to become something new something better than somebody else I know more than this guy knows that's the devil folk that's the devil because he wanted a bigger Kingdom right he wanted a better Kingdom than God gave him if he would have stayed in his position he'd have been all right right he wanted a better Kingdom he wanted more knowledge all right forget that business get down get down with God and say God this is not something new but let me be the epistle that's already been written amen see but the epistle that's been written made manifest right God I want you to manifest nothing that's not in the Bible amen right he don't require that that's right he requires though that you do what is in the description it's those who believe the word and the promise of this day that God is pouring out his Spirit upon All Flesh and that is written a pencil and when a person tries to carmally impersonate that right fires your life's going to show what you are right number 11. just a few more and I think that I think that's a very fine example of we parents today to set an example before our children now you'll live your best and your worst at home yeah right all right that's right the man knew what he's talking about he was the parent he said you'll live your best and you're worst at home right and I think that our lives though the children might not just exactly act like they're noticing it but they are notice right don't you never think they are not because they're watching right not only the children are watching but the neighbors are watching not only the neighbors are watching but all that you are associated with right sure watch you right the people at your church watches you the people that you did the business with in the markets they're watching you right after your confession we should always try to reflect Christ in everything that we do well it's easy to do it here you got the atmosphere and you got the singing and you got this is the place where God's going to meet us and everything's these wonderful you're at your best and your worst at home number 12. this is the last one excuse me I like this all right here was voices this is Revelation chapter four oh how we need in Lula Georgia yeah thousands of live voices amen you want to hear the thunder of God everybody wants to know what the Thunders are amen exactly it's you right right praise the Lord the father of God thundering out in sweetness and Holiness Purity undefiled Life walking around in the Earth today without a blemish right oh I'm sorry that was preached before the sale though yeah so we're supposed to live it then before the sealed open see he he didn't have as much Revelation as he did after the seal doesn't open them all that's all enough I need right there right thousands of live voices the Thunder of God thundering out in sweetness and Holiness Purity undefined life walking around in the Earth today without a blemish right yes sir real Christians that son that's thunder against the enemy amen the devil don't count how loud you can haul it the devil don't care how much you can jump or how much you can this or that or Shout but What Hurts The Devil is to see that Sanctified holy life consecrated to God right say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as it can be and move right on oh my that throws him away that's the Thunder that shakes the Delray just like well you say if we could preach like Billy Graham or an Oral Roberts or somebody a great influential speaker he'd he'd be oh no right oh no he said on him sometimes the devil just laughs at that exactly I'm glad Billy Graham and Oral Roberts probably wouldn't listen to that but he's making a point because y'all we're great men but they're great men for their time sometimes the devil just laughs at that he don't pay no more attention to and all the Seminary training and the devil just sits back and laughs at it but when he sees that life amen he does not know how to handle you living I've said many times before when when I became a Christian the devil lost a good fighter he lost a good guy he lost a good person and and that probably throwed him into convulsions more than anything was that when he would come and and try to get me to do what I used to do in the same you should all know it was all different it was all the way up here and it was flowers and I saw fireworks no I was I still had to go to work every day yeah I still had to go home every day I still had to live life yeah right I just lived it different because things were coming I would right I would take them and I would not do I remember what I used to do I told you many times I you know I could without saying without shooting you between eyes I could put you down pretty good with just my voice my my the way I said things the condescending attitude that I had that that everybody was down here and I was up here you know but that was the devil because that's his attitude he's up here and everybody else is down here right so that's the attitude so the best thing to do is do like brother Brown said do the vice versa right just try to say oh I'm sorry and go on you know it doesn't matter if you're right or wrong we got to live that life let's go go back to number 11 Brother Joseph just for a second number 11. when you live your best and worst at home now I know there's some things and both my kids are here today praise the Lord but there are some things I told them the other not too long ago could have been a year or two ago that there's some things they're doing that I didn't do so they didn't get that from me some of you kids are going to get stuff just from the devil right so don't blame yourself and don't knock yourself all over the place for some of the things but let me tell you something I killed that child against the holy ghost or gets out one of the two you are their Holy Ghost right exactly you are their Holy Ghost right so if they're not doing this right you need to say something about it right if they're doing this wrong you need to say something about it what I don't care how old they are don't have another day she stays at home with us she's still gonna live under daddies what daddy says right daddy says because you're living under my roof daddy said I don't care if you're 35 one day so don't care if you're 35 years old if you put your feet under my table and I have to buy you groceries and buy you clothes you're gonna do what I tell you to do now if we would use that attitude but it was in an attitude where I knew he was telling the truth I mean that was the truth it wasn't just something to come out of my mouth quit being friends to kids yeah stop it stop being friends I can be a friend of your gift but you don't be a friend right now brother Brown said he said be a friend to him but now that remember Rebecca was 18 years old now that's when they need a friend when they're 18 19 20 17 somewhere in there they need a friend but you still are you still are responsible for that person right got it amen you're responsible for them I don't care what you who you think you are you are connected to them DNA wise right and God expects you I didn't bring a quote a few minutes ago I read it and I didn't put it in this but you know brother Brown said that I'm going to go back to my um part that I did about the uh husband and wife brother Brown said if your wife if your wife is not under the headship of you she's out of the will of God right and we'll never get right until she does right I'll bring that quote next time but I didn't bring it I wanted to keep it to about 12 quotes to about 8 30 when we get out of here it was about 25 after but all these things I didn't do those 12 sermons on how to live your life and how to treat your wife and how to treat your husband and how to treat your kids and I just went off in the Netherworld I guess somewhere but it's like I was telling them at the Master's meeting we we have to watch out for your soul right yes we are responsible right for you exactly we're responsible all right so what you do out there reflects here right everything you do out there reflects here right and we fail but my gosh people we're gonna have to come to a place right there we should always try to reflect Christ in everything right that we do amen everything exactly that we love right if we don't then we're wrong let's just admit we're wrong I told him downstairs in the same suit class let's just do like brother Jackson said the Bible says repent yeah and repent is not your saying I'm sorry Lord I'm sorry Lord I'm sorry Lord I'm sorry Lord why don't you just run it off on a sheet of paper and just hand it to them every time you do something when are we going to come to the place to where we don't do that no more right it's not part of us anymore I'm done with that that's being buried when you bury something it ain't gonna come back to life unless it's born again yeah man if you're born again it ain't dead right right right but if it's not born again it's dead right right dead means not bring it back up again that's what's been burning on my heart that that we as people we can't preach to the world thank God that we can get out to some that listen and that's great and we appreciate that but I like what brother Tim cross said that's kind of what struck me the other day was he said you know I dress like I do because I dress for where I'm going yeah remember that Sunday I dress for where I'm going right he said you don't see somebody in the airport just fixing to go to Alaska he's got on a pair of shorts short sleeves and a flowery top now you look at that guy and go I bet he's going to Florida yeah what he dresses for where he's going yeah that's pretty profound and I told him you know I was telling June the other day she was talking about um we were talking about her family and all you know thinking things and I thought about that when we thought about it when he said that I said you know that's what you can tell your family I dress different because I dressed from where I'm going right right if you dress like the world that's where you're going right well be dressed like Christians that's where you're heading for right right that's why you say well it's all do's and don'ts no it's all connected right it's all connected together sure it is on a paper do not do this and do this and don't do this the light brother Brown said he said I'm only going to spell woman won't put on a pair of pants right holy ghost woman one cutter half right that's pretty plain right all right get them born again and then start growing up the statue of a perfect man our problem is is we're wanting to get there without repentance right without a life live without somebody coming and say hey man I know you're a Christian because you act different you talk different you walk different you do different things than what you used to do right man I told you the story remember when I come back to the Lord we had our uh geez 20-year class reunion because I got born again there in 1998 and then June of 1998 we had our 20th class reunion and I was voted the most changed guy there Hallelujah I've got the certificate for it they saw I was different now they were saying I changed physically yeah but when I sat down in that car Jim was gone on a cruise with you some of your sisters that went on that cruise she was she wasn't there and I sat down in a car and just started crying I said Thank You Lord amen yeah I said whether they see they only saw me for like of course I was part of the class um I was classifieds president so I had to meet with several of the seven or eight of the other girls and guys I had to meet with him and we had to get all the food ready and all that stuff so they saw me but the other 60 that I graduated with hadn't seen me before you know before the 20 years or 10 years and then when he come up and they wanted to know who's this guy who's this guy who's this guy you know what I didn't even dress like them my hair was fine I dress conservative so they could at least see that part of me was changed but when I got in the car I said God so much as you you've identified that that I've changed you've let that whole class see me as a changed person and that's always stuck with me but I want to ask you something can your family can your classmates can your business associate can the people you work with every day know that you are not the same person that they knew 20 years ago or not the same person that you knew 10 years ago or not the same person you knew two years ago there's no life and you walk through the when you walk through Walmart when you walk through anywhere you walk through you're a written epistle your God in letter form right right but you have moved off of that letter and become flesh right that's why in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God Amen all when Jesus was the word was made if you're the word who was it made flesh Among Us right right brother Nick make it personal and the word was made flesh amen Among Us right yeah all that's talking about Jesus I thought the scriptures that spoke of him spoke of us right see how we miss it we miss it in the walk right we miss it and every day ABC's right how many times did Brother Brown understand how many times did Brother Brown say how can I teach my people algebra and they don't even know their ABCs the Bible says Satan not the sending of yourself together and it says something about the mores that they approach it right we let ever a little absolute I want to tell you something people June's family and my other extended family that doesn't that they're not Christians they know one thing's for sure I ain't gonna be home on Sunday you know and I ain't gonna be home on Wednesday night right so what kind of testimony are you showing by Mission church right and being with them or being with a loved one by being with this one no make a stand right I'm going to church when you're going on right I want church when the game goes or not right that's what days always said that's that's been you want to be successful in life pick somebody that's successful in life and imitate that right at least try to fit yourself to it uh you know I you don't wanna be a recovering alcoholic and have 14 alcoholic friends around you the whole time that's what repent means repent me get out of that change Gloria get away from that do something different telling you people we are a powerful church but I promise you our fluser stops done right our everyday walk in life should be that that man is a Christian that woman is a Christian right every day of our life not your Sunday and Wednesday that's right the devil has loves on Sunday and Wednesday amen did you come to church where he's at let's sing a song 272. the treasures you're happy before we Hallelujah I found a land of promise got into Canaan it was a Happy Land but they still had to fight right for every inch of ground that they possessed they had to get all them ice out right right that's the same thing with you and I we got to get all those ice out we got to get rid of the people that are squatters which is the devil on our property because we do have a land of promise Glory we do have a place that we can be happy we can be Christians and not be sad we can be Christians and not be uh tore up and broke down all the time all right that's right um my Lord Ruth would just she was so happy right she was resting Glory brother boy if it was something it would tear us to pieces if we knew we had to do it all ourselves yeah but Ruth just said Boaz amen you're the only one who can do it right and when we lay this thing down one day we're going to realize that sure it's not we it's not being Gibby they get it but remember one thing brother Brandon made a very profound statement he said this is my eye right God gave it to me but it came from God Amen and it's going back to God right all right that's right this is my eye this is my Holy Ghost didn't give his parents gave him what I'm looking at but the parent I can't see is the one that gave something I can't see unless he lives and out right once he lives it out then I see what's inside right amen that's why it's a work from the inside to justification sanctification you know I want to ask you a question how many of you have just sat down and went back through your life just sit down just go back through your life and you know that God and sure God does things for you know yourself he does things for you but it do you really it's what really made me think about it coming up to the end of the year there and and what brother Jason was preaching on repentance you know I want us to be not that we just come into this church and sit down right and become a message believe right um I I don't know a lot of you were here before I got here so I can't say this for everybody but but do we understand that brother Brown said talk about dry eye confession and that's what brother Jason was talking about he it was so laborious because Godly sorrow leads to repentance when we fall down on our knees and say God I've done something wrong am I your child is it something because when I told you many times before only in my experience when I came up out of the water I just felt so clean and so empty it's like it's like I had scales on Me Brother Gary and then those scales just just when I come out of the water they just weren't there anymore yeah man June and I just hugged and cried for for 10 minutes you know but but I gave my heart to the Lord right here right and I didn't just say God I'm sorry for what it didn't turn around walked out all right I labored for months right oh yeah trying to get rid of some of the things Brother Gary man I labored from I wished it would have been just a one one moment deal yeah but I labored for months trying to get rid of some of the things right and here I've labored for years now trying to get rid of some things but there's some things that are dead and when it's dead don't dig it up right amen it's buried right one other thought Christianity was before brother random got here right Christianity started on the day of Pentecost when God failed 120 people with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and they went out doing signs and wonders and miracles and they started going out into the places and they knew that that was God in those people right see the people around them knew that that was God in the people right people around them knew that Mighty group of people in the book of Ephesus they have a huge church for the boy they had 12 people amen but you know what give me 12 Holy Ghost fail people versus 500 people in a sanctuary I'll take the 12 every time man right right because you got unbelievers or maybe I don't know what kind of I don't know what you do with the quote for brother Brown said in every congregation there's a make-believers unbelievers and True Believers if if the Church of Baptist was all full of the Holy Ghost and there was only 12 of them maybe they had some ministers a few days but what I'm saying is is like Saint Martin Saint Martin was not satisfied until every person in his church was filled with a holy ghost amen wasn't satisfied maybe that's the urge that I have is that if we can get everybody full of the Holy Ghost sure it's not going to take care of all of our human problems but maybe it will help our spiritual problem right it will help our ups and downs and driving read intervale's Precinct that's a long time ago but really Intervale it used to be Intervale but they put an interval but read that it's a really good book you preached it like 1956. look what brother Brown was doing back in the in back in 47 to 63 watching he's he's getting the people born again he's getting the people trying to look toward God look toward what God's fixing to do and then because remember and then the healing service was debate on the hook right but they kept nibbling at the bait and didn't get the hook the hook was a revealed word of God that he was stepping into a new part of his ministry well same way with you and I we've got to be born again first then we got to have a walk through God and bring us and give us the hook right right you don't want us to stay on the bed he wants us to take the hook because when did we take the hook we go out of here we leave up we get taken out of this water called the world you love the Lord amen let's consecrate ourselves let's make ourselves more aware of you so I don't care what anybody thinks about me you're a liar right that's right you're a liar right that's right you do care what people think about right I do I can brother Branch it off that guy was lying when he said I don't I don't care if anybody says it's a good sermon he says that man was not telling the truth right he said I like for somebody to Pat me on the back he was human he didn't want to tell no story he didn't want to lie he said I appreciate somebody telling me good sermon to Pat me on the back you know electrics to all be Christians amen but let's reflect it so that they can see us Glory it's easy to be Christians right here because we know not to say bad words we don't have to lie or do these little things but when we're out there around a bunch of liars and a bunch of drugs and a bunch of Thieves and a bunch of this a bunch of that the other how do we live right that's right how do we live that's good that's right because they're going to watch you and when you profess to be a Christian you better live it to the T amen because they're gonna be picking Every Little Feather they can find they're going to be picking on right but you know what beloved Christian Life doesn't matter you pick all I want to man oh sure they're gonna say oh you didn't do this well so what but what do they think about you when you walk away I told somebody the other day I don't know who it was I believe it was day on it it worked we were talking about something I said you know even when I was a sinner when I own my own business I could go back today to every Banker I could go back to everybody that I dealt with I could go back to every customer that I ever had even when I was a sinner even when I was a sinner I could go back and face every one of those people in my life yeah that's right now I tell them I lived a bad life and they knew I said bad words and did bad things but as far as my dealings of my personal life and my business to me that was important so I could go back to anybody in my past life now sure there's a lot about after a bit David but in my past life though it would not follow me it wouldn't follow me right because when you get born again it cuts that thing off right man he cuts that thing off and then then you might have to go repent not having to go repent for things I've done but like Daddy's always said those bankers and all those people they know how many parents were why because that was just a common thing for us to do but that reflects too on our Christian Life right being Christians in everything that we do every Walk of Life you go to Walmart and somebody's speech across to you or jumps in line so what big deal leave him in line right they don't know where they're going right they don't have a clue where they're going right why are you mad at people I had to really work on people cutting me off driving car yeah but it's gone I don't do that no more don't bother me but again I'm like God Save The Soul right forget about me being mad at them don't be mad I don't feel sorry for him right say God I'd be just that if it wasn't for you right I'd be just that I would act just like that if it wasn't for you no then you can say God thank you for what you've done in my life right what a difference he's made in my life this power the heavenly father we pray Lord tonight we've said something new we'll be pleasing to you and Lord it will help your people father because it's not me it's not brother Dale it's not P it's not the preachers it it's you speaking through US Warren it's you doing the work through all of our lives that we can see a reflection of you Lord and not a reflection of a human being Lord will she Christ and everything that we do that is our work on Earth Here Lord when it's done we can lay down all these things or that you're feeding and say father we've done the best we can do and he's you will say that Dave welcome in you've done a good job you fought a good fight you've kept the faith enter into the joy of the Lord has been waiting on you

well Lord you send that to all of your children you're pleased to dwell now Lord let us reflect that back out to you Lord let that be our desire in our heart today is to to live a sermon not so much as trying to tell people what we know but Lord don't let our lives drown that out let our lives live exemplary to you Lord let us take up as it would take a checklist or a checkup and and see what our problems might be and Lord let it reflect through the word let it reflect through our pastor Lord and let it not be a reproach on him that we go out and do something wrong or or do something to someone else and then get back to him Lord that that we've done we're his children and Lord he has to answer for the things that we do and and God forbid that we'll do anything that would harm our actions in our in our ways and our doings that would be contrary to the to the ministry of this church Lord we're a family here we have family members and this is the greatest family that ever lived on the face of the Earth you can have Rockefellers and you can have all those different ones but they can have all those names but if they're not born again they're nothing I don't care how much money then how much power and Prestige they have doesn't matter how many presidents of the United States you took hands with Lord but have we shook the tender hand of Jehovah and we ask you Lord Purge our life and we ask you to just take full control and and Lord if we be one with you father Lord let that be our desire that is my desire Lord that would be more like you Lord then we'll act more like you father and the things that we do will be pleasing in your sight Lord forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes the false and fails that we have towards you Lord give us this day our daily bread and let it not be Lord cast out into the water and and not return void you said it would you said it would absolutely accomplish what it said it would accomplish for it and I pray that you do that in our lives Lord consecrator sanctifies for this journey that we're on Lord that it's getting closer to the end time and we should be the more where we draw together the more where we want to come together

standing there realizing in in his in his human mind he was afraid and and maybe had doubts and and fears but Lord when he saw you a long time ago that came up and said peace be still the piece that passes all understanding and then he could go to his daughter and she know that you were there with her yeah you were the one there's no human being could have been in that car and not been hurt but Lord when you put a human being and an angel Lord that's the thing that we want we want that angel leading our life yes protecting us from the things that the devil sure would love to destroy every one of us but Lord we have a purpose in life we have we're part of your plan and we're you are going to see it achieved and Lord is our Boaz as Our Redeemer we lay at your feet as Ruth did and she
