TRANSCRIPT
========================================
go ye into all the world we're reading we just started the recording we're reading Mark 16:15 go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature it's interesting how you know I'm not sure maybe how other other Sunday school teachers men would not come up with things to teach on but um you know just you're reading things and and things kind of stand out you know when you're reading the message and just a little scripture will will pop out and this week I I was reading and and this something brother BR said about this scripture just really popped out and um so I I have some quotes I wanted to read and just some things to look at give it a second but um so we we kind of read the background of getting up to this scripture uh that uh Jesus was presented before the uh the government the people that were in in power and they didn't understand what what he was about what um you know pilot said show me what is truth and and we know all the all the stories about the Pharisees and Sadducees that when they when when they were presented with Christ they didn't understand who he was and what it was and maybe um I I think maybe sometimes we don't realize what we have and um so when we when we come up to this scripture Christ is he paid the price for us and he rose from the dead and when uh he was presented to the discip the story was told to the disciples about he's risen from the dead he's not he's not still in the Tomb and they had trouble believe in him and then he he when he finally appeared before him he uh upgraded him and and said um you know told him you know the thing that you have been looking for the thing that have been Pro throughout the whole Old Testament is now before you and you don't understand and he gave them this commission before uh he you know he he left this this last the last message to the disciples and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature so I I kind of want to take this little scripture and and uh as as my good friend brother Matthew BR and M likes to say that'll preach and uh I I think this this scripture right here will preach you can take this I want to take this scripture up and break it into two three different parts and look at preach the gospel to Every Creature because I I think there's some really powerful things in this little scripture what what this means go you into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature so the first thing I want to look at and you know a lot of these little lessons I I kind of um as just the Lord will put something in my in my heart and but then also you know you hear the little questions and things people have and so maybe the first part and um you know I was talking to some of y'all yesterday and and this was already on my heart to speak on but maybe there's a little question about what what is preaching what's the difference between you know when uh maybe there's a question about um well let's let's get into it what what is what is pre is is preaching getting up and and just going through a list of bullet points is is uh you know when brother Dale gets up there is he preaching or is he you know is there a difference between a teacher and a preacher now now the the the last message that Jesus sent that Jesus told to the church to the to the ministry and brother R said this scripture was to the fivefold ministry preach the gospel go you into all the world and preach the gospel not just to like part of the fful ministry not just to you know uh the the ones that sweat a lot and not to the ones that can really put the scripture into place but preaching the gospel is is uh a a gift where you you can get yourself out of the way and let God speak through you so I want to just read some some of these uh some of these things that brother brand said about it and in 1953 whatever he says to you do it now on the platform when the Holy Spirit are speaking thank you that that might be about all I can do now on the platform when the Holy Spirit is speaking and he's speaking through mortal lips he always does I believe these are ministers behind me and Brethren you never preached a sermon in your life the Holy Spirit you never preached a sermon in your life now uh I mean just to be blunt many men do get up and and I remember there was a uh I heard about this this little brother years ago that when a man would get up behind the pit and he'd say something like do you believe that was of the Lord of a man and he' say he just jump right out say that was 100% of man you and uh you know sometimes you uh well that's all I'll say about that he always brother you never preached a sermon in your life real preaching is not not you getting up and saying your own ideas it's God God speaking through you the Holy Spirit preach to You Preach through you a sermon that's right see see that see we don't preach the holy Spirit does the speaking oh we might write out something and read it but that isn't preaching preaching is when inspiration comes and see and it's preached by inspiration and the holy spirit gives the unction now now we a lot of times we get in our minds that that really real preaching is when you get all worked up and and you sweat a lot and that's what I was talking about my last sermon a real Revival doesn't come just because somebody sweating a lot or that's not really anointing the real anointing maybe a lot of times you can't really tell you know I I was watching brother wake down here one time when he was talking about comparing uh downloading an update from the internet and you know the Holy Spirit can speak through him and explain that better than I can well that's my job my day job is is working with the internet but the Holy Spirit by inspiration can speak through him and he can he can tie that together with the word and explain that better than than I could with just technology and brother brother brother Dale would get up uh you know and and break down the word and and just uh put things together in a way that you know maybe not sweating a lot but it's still just as much inspiration as somebody that gets up there rapid fire uh you know folks just F flying off the lip one after another because it's the the Holy Spirit speaking through him uh now we can read something that just doesn't matter but when the Holy Spirit gets a hold of it and it takes it out to the people then something takes a hold of see and that's the Holy Spirit that's not your pastor preaching that's the Holy Spirit preaching in your pastor out to you giving the message and that's when you you know you you like I heard somebody recently saying you you uh you'll think about things during the week and and you'll maybe have a question in your mind and then the Holy Spirit the the minister had even thought wasn't even meditating on that maybe but then the holy spirit will just speak that answer out to you and and that's real Ministry amen and and you know maybe sometimes I'm a poor excuse for one but at least I know what Reon is blam barus 1952 now tonight I'm very Fort a minister with just assume preach about once a day did you know that preaching is harder on you than most any kind of am labor you can do I've seen that estimated and broken down I believe it as compared I think that 20 minutes of preaching under inspiration takes more from your physical body than 8 hours of a sledgehammer because is you get getting out of the way and the Holy Spirit getting speaking through you and you know you can you can do the same thing with some some people have gifts where you can get up in front of people and speak but there's also people you know Andrew in the Bible brother said he can get up and pray all night now that's a different kind of gift where God can speak through you in prayer where you get you get uh you you get somebody on your heart and you just go to labor for them and God begins to speak to you like that time brother BR was praying and he heard heard somebody in German speaking he didn't know who it was and it turns out it was the Lord speaking through him in another language calling out for somebody that he didn't even know nothing about it turned out that uh the Lord was speaking to him in prayer and Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I am not a preacher so I just kind of always said I was a spare tire in the spare tire use it when you get a PL I just threw this in there because you know there's a lot of quotes brother say brother says I am not a preacher or you say well okay he you know get something in your head you know but I I was reading where uh you know brother Neville in the church uh some they gave him like a little painting that a little brother in in the church painted and and uh the the little brother had wrote a poem about how he he he's so he's such an humble man he says he says he's not a preacher but when he put him behind the pit and you find out I forget how it goes you'll find out you know the point of it was find out he he can preach better than than a lot of people that say they are and and this next quote kind of confirm this is what we're talking about now the gospel and you know I'm not a preacher I have no education I can't preach I don't claim to be but my preaching is by a gift confirmation of what preachers preach about now he's got uh uh you know many many preachers will just uh he said a minister don't have a right to get behind the poop until he have an experience he knows what he's talking about and I I believe this is kind of what along the lines of what he's saying here I I know when he got over there in India and they were challenging him you know he said bring your worst case I I don't care what it is bring your worst case up and we'll see he's got the confirmation of what preachers just preached about many preachers just get up and just talk about it but he's got the confirmation and and maybe we'll find out when we get into what the gospel is that that's really what the gospel is about so speak to the Rock what what is the gospel let me let me go back a second and talk more about the ministry cuz you know we and and you know really I would never have talked about this unless maybe there was a little question about uh you know you just kind of well you know in in First Corinthians Paul was speaking to the Corinthians and he they they kind of got in their head that this this ministry was better than that Ministry but and Paul told him you know this uh you know I planted a poish water but but who is it that gives the increase it's God that gives the increase and and and I think of it is like the um the the first four books of the Bible ma Matthew Mark Luke and John they they wrote different perspectives of Jesus get the fivefold looks an evangelist come in and say well I I see they're looking at like maybe Matthew looking at from this side I see it this way and another one come in oh but have you seen it this way kind of turn around and look at it from this direction and you once you get all the different five folds then you can see a better picture of what you really um you really what Christ is all about so what is the gospel go you into into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature and and you know you can break down look at it from a technical perspective the go goel it it comes from this Greek word yalon that the literal if if you took if you took that it broke it up into two parts in the Old English they they made this this name they call it Goat spell which literally means uh good news so that's where you know you hear the gospel is the good news the good news of of uh you know Jesus died and and rose from the dead and paid for our sins and paid the price and you know I I I was thinking about the five4 ministry is kind of like salesman and I think a lot a lot of times you know when you're talking to people at work or whatever you you maybe get in your head a lot of times that this is hard to sell but it shouldn't be it sells itself you don't have to work anything up to uh convince somebody or um just just lay it in front of them because uh you know as easy as it is to sell some people just don't want it it doesn't take a slicked up S somebody that can can you know lay everything down just uh it's as easy to sell as he he's risen from the dead you know Christ said lo I with you always those things should should just cause us all to be burning in our heart to have a stronger desire you know when the first time you heard the word think about maybe U you know this this there's a prophet you know something it didn't take maybe uh well maybe some of us did take beat us upside the head but uh you know it it it sells itself and and the traditional explanation of the Gospel is it's it's just the teaching of Jesus Christ that just and whenever you put the word just in there that uh that should be a red flag cuz it's not just the teaching out the you know the word had to be sewn first and then it comes to life that's right it's not just the teaching and so let's look at some quotes uh speak to the Rock 1953 now the gospel is not allog together the word this is the word of God and all things must be based upon this word if it isn't it isn't true this is but Jesus said go you in all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature now he did not say teach the word he said preach the gospel because teaching the word is part of preaching the gospel preaching the gospel includes teaching the word he's not saying the gospel doesn't include teaching the word teaching the word is part of it so the gospel consists more than teaching the word for Paul confirming said the gospel came to us not in word only but through Power demonstrations of the holy spirit will come and demonstrate the gospel bring the word to a living reality and earnestly contending for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints he said um we've had plenty of passing out tracks and theology around the world but the gospel is not the Bible all together the Bible said Paul said the gospel came to us not in word only but through Power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost then when Jesus said go into all the world and preach the gospel Every Creature then he meant go into all the world and demonstrate the power of God to every creature and you know uh you as I was studying on this you know I was telling some of you yesterday morning we got a call that Monica's mama had been put in the hospital with uh they told her she had uh the cancer came back and and uh and of course later on the day uh we found out the doctors would be in presumptions they had run no test or anything were just saying that she had cancer when they had done done any test or anything but you know when you when you come upon situations in life where you know somebody's sick or um uh and I really got thinking brother me and brother Aaron and brother Joe all just went up to brother Tim hes for the the the meetings and and uh me and brother Aaron went up to stand in the prayer line and and you know there's people coming through that will really have evil spirits on them and you can't go into the prayer line brother Tim he was to all Minister for the prayer line if any of you ministers doubt that you have the Holy Ghost you know go sit down because you can't come up there and say well I I I'm going to I know what brother Dale said about the Seven Seals I know what uh brother brand I I read the church a book you can't come up there with just a letter but it's got to be a living gospel and that's what the gospel is not just the letter of the law on the page but a living reality in your life something living in you that something uh something alive and it's is not something it's not myself but it's the power of God in your life and uh Paul I was reading in Colossians 1:23 this is well you know brother Dell says that uh he when I started preaching he said every Minister needs their own scripture to preach from him and brother Wade's got one mine is Colossians 1: 12627 and Colossians 1:23 says if you continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel which he have heard the hope of the Gospel which is not just a letter of the law but a living reality and which was preached to every creature which is under Heaven whereof I Paul and made a Ministry now I like this because he's he's saying the the commission from Christ was to go and preach the gospel to every creature and Paul say and I've done that I have not just preached it I I'm not just not just taught it but I have lived it out it's it living reality I you lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and if you read on further further down it's it's uh the power of God in your life and when you uh because signs and wond there's a promise that signs and wonders shall follow them that believe and I'm not say these things to issue a challenge or anything but I'm saying it to maybe build your faith up that that this is supposed to be in the Christian Life and I I really believe that a Christian cannot help but have signs and W wonders fall in because you know just through your daily life when you forget your keys uh you ask God to show you your keys to find things for just little things like that when you're uh like I was talking about walking from the subway and the spirit of God just comes down and and uh you know somebody beside me starts shouting and glorifying God just little things throughout the day because it's not just teaching it's not just the letter of the law but it's something a li in you and and just continue on that last quote I was reading so it's not just a ritualistic affair but it's absolutely a real living reality of the resurrection of Jesus Christ living among men the angel of the Lord 1951 paragraph E11 our ministry has changed it over and said oh there's a real believer I tell you he loves the Lord and he goes to church every Sunday and he pays is DED to the church and he treats his neighbor right that's just moral act the holy spirit in the man demonstrates the power of the supernatural what makes him a Believer it's God vindicating that he is a Believer Jesus said these not them the these shines shall follow them that believe and you know this is a real simple message but it tie it does tie together with it ties together with brother Wan teaching the statute of perfect man because a statute of a perfect man is the gospel it's the gospel that has been by the way will lay it down and explain it and put uh put it all out teach it by inspiration and then let the Holy Spirit Come and Quicken it and bring it to life because God said brother R said that the word is like an electric wire that it provides a conduit for the spirit to come behind it and Quicken it and bring it to life he said first the word went out in the beginning the word went out and then the Spirit came behind it to bring it to life and you can you can Bank on it if you when when the ministry gets up behind the pullit and preaches the word if it's the true where the spirit will come behind it and bring to life that's why you can you you uh after the after the you know we were talking about many churches don't have alter calls or uh or they don't lay hands on the Seck anymore but but that I'm thankful that we go to a church that allows the opportunity for the spirit to come behind that word and you can come up and and if you have a need in your life or something something is not right you come up and get the elders to lay hands on you and that word that has been preached becomes quickened and the go that becomes the gospel being preached not just being taught but the gospel being live and Made Alive good now this this quote I I believe it's difficult to understand this quote without going to Isaiah chapter 66 y y'all turn with me to Isaiah chapter 66 and and I think this kind of Falls in line with what brother brother Dale has been teaching on about the serpent seed and the what happened in the garden the the gospel is uh is it's not just letters on the page and and many times we we'll uh you know we try to figure things out and um if you try to figure it out then uh if if the if the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the birth of the word and you seow a corruptible seed that has been hybrid with your own ideas and how how can that come to life and produce the Original Seed first the the true the uh unhate seed has to be sow you know that's why uh when when God was trying to speak to balam and balum didn't understand it so he had to speak to him so through an H is pure bread and that's the only way he get to Baum so he had to speak to him through through something that wasn't hybrid now in Isaiah chapter 66 oh let's see yeah let's start about verse 15 you know brother talked about how Isaiah is like a mirrors the Bible there's 66 books in the Bible in 66 chapters in Isaiah and this last chapter gets gets into talking about how the restoration of Israel and and how God's going to purge it by fire and Purge all the things that shouldn't be shouldn't be there just like in your life how he's by the holy baptism the holy ghost that that his that consuming fire comes into your life and cleanses out everything that's not supposed to be there so let's start about Isaiah chapter 66 verse1 15 for behold the Lord will come with fire how about that and with his chariots like a whirlwind to render his anger with Fury and his rebuke with flames of fire for by fire and by his sword will the Lord plead with with All Flesh and the slain of the Lord shall be many they that sanctify themselves and purify themselves where in the garden behind one tree in the midst eating swine's flesh and the Abomination and the mouth shall be consumed together sayeth the Lord because now this is uh this is talking about the people that that wrap their say it like this wrap their arms around the tree of knowledge I'm going to figure it out I'm going to prove that I'm right by doing things that God's word does not allow I'm going to prove that uh wrap their arms around the tree of knowledge and prove by their own mental conception that they're okay with you know cutting their hair and or just just an example do doing things that God's word clearly if you have a uh a spiritual mind clearly disallows and that's what uh yeah this is that's what this this this quote is talking about 1963 the token Believers should be separating the things from the things of the world the cares of the world that's the reason I hammer at women and so forth the way I have and then separate yourselves from these TV programs separate yourselves from this Hollywood evangelism come back to deepness and sincerity we stand in the pullit and jump up and down and laugh and holler and carry on women dance over the floors clothes on them real skin tight and all kinds of jewelry and stuff hanging on with Bob here that some of them will make up on and they got an intellectual Pastor there a preacher that can put the word together so perfect that isn't it we don't come to the altar of God laughing carrying on and cutting up we come to the altar with sincerity and deepness because there we are dying now you read this quote and talk about an intellectual Pastor there preacher that can put the word together so perfect that's not talking about our pastor that's talking about somebody that will put their arms around the tree of knowledge and try to put it together in a way that by their own mental intellect by their own knowledge and try to try to uh prove things that aren't there and that's what the denominations do today is they'll uh uh form up get in their own form form denominations around their own ideas and get away from God's word and say we're right because we've got a little building we' got a little organization or whatever but when Paul heard the word he separated himself and Paul put the word together not like in Isaiah 66 but he put together the word together like a real preacher with an anointing of the holy spirit that could put together the word together and say well uh here's what really happened with Abraham and s and here's you know like Abel where where does it say that Abel uh how his sacrifice was consumed but the Bible does say it it says it all through the scripture where does the bible say what the seventh seal is but it does say it it does say it all all through the scripture and it it it Paul never said spoke things that weren't written in the scripture but he was able by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit to put it all together and and and and say things that only God uh Only God Can reveal no man can do like Isaiah that's that's what Isaiah 66:17 is talking about trying to put it together by your own ideas led by the Holy Spirit it never come to us through word only the word got to be quickened and made alive in the demonstration of the power of the Holy Ghost then if you call that the greater things surely you can do the lesser things go heal the sick I'm just kind of trying to scam through some of these quotes that we got about three more minutes uh the the gospel is the sign of the Living God moving among the people and then just to finish up here every creature now this this is just so beautiful because a lot of people say you know like brother Dale has been saying about how many people say you shouldn't preach to uh to people that you know are predestinated according to their understanding of what predestination is and I remember hearing uh years ago about people that would say I'm afraid my children are serpent seed and you get all the these ideas in your head that you know that uh but you know by my maybe my kids there's no way for them to be saved but we know that uh the God's word doesn't teach that if if you have a a spiritual you know see things the way that God wants us to see but um so the the gospel is not just preach to just a special group of people it's supposed to be preached to every creature and you say okay well we're going to preach to the Lost and to the saved but the go the Bible says the preaches to Every Creature every creature on Earth because remember if you go all the way back to the beginning Adam if if the gospel is the word being made manifest in the power and demonstration of the spirit Adam uh now I don't have a quote for this so y'all you you know you take it or leave it but Adam moved the the trees and the rivers and the Animals by the power of the spirit and and I believe that's that's preaching to go gospel the word came from forth from Adam's mouth and that's preaching the gospel right there every creature you believe that means that brother R said in in five definite identifications of the True Church of the Living God 1960 I seen God baffle a bull one day right I seen him call horn that's not distinct I've seen him raised up an apostle and that been laying dead all night every creature the gospel will take effect upon anything that you asked now that's that's good right there I remember one one time I I we had a little this is the before the dog we had now but it ran out we had a little dog that ran out in the road got hit by a car and all the little kitties uh came just laid hands on the little dog it got smacked by that car and it they they um the neighbor ended up taking it to the vet but there was nothing wrong with that little dog because the gospel had been preached to that little dog now you think about a little a little animal like a little fishy that's raised from the dead now what will the gospel do to if it'll do that to a little animal what will the gospel do to you the gospel will take effect upon anything that you ask you say that's wrong brother Brown it isn't wrong so we'll stop right there amen that's the gospel
