TRANSCRIPT
========================================
open the eyes of my heart I want to see I want to see you open the eyes of my heart in the eyes of my heart I want to see amen I want to see you to see you hi and let your desire shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and amen [Music] shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love yes Lord oh oh holy hope [Music] amen and amen and I want to see him don't you good to see everybody the house the Lord if you'd like to following your scriptures turn what we've been reading in 1st Peter 1 and second Peter 1 is everyone for another remember all the announcements that's been made and the different things that we were praying for I prayed the Lord would lesson and guide each one and the healings and virtues cause he said he promised it said he sent his word and healed and delivered us from destruction so I believe that don't you and I look forward to all of the things that he does for us to show the manifestation of his love for each one of us and we would just thank the Lord amen hmm I know he's already sung it but today's Terrance's birthday so he's he's got to be you know somewhere in in age because that makes us older so we won't he's getting social closer to Social Security he's following Wade but they're they're getting on up there you know so when they get to be in Social Security will be in unsocial so that's somewhere close another way I got so remember that all right first Peter and then the second Peter Lord Jesus we thank you for this day and your grace on to us and we thank you for your loving understanding of us thank you for you Lord and we ask you now to just bless us and keep us in the Lord to show your love and understanding into our hearts and our lives and to come down and open our eyes to understanding of thy word that we may see you and father we ask you to just reach down and touch each one remember the sick among us and remember your promises so we thank you for all of these things we love you and we just cherish your presence with us keep us in Jesus name and we have a little announcement to make we did it looks like we're going to be able to pick up some property over here beside of us and we thank the Lord for that that they're there sitting up and getting everything where we can get a little more into our we've been allowed to use for parking but now we're going to be able to get the property and the way it looks it's not going to cost us any time so that would be great we'll have to divide it between the two churches but that's good we can take care of no problem so we we thank the Lord that he's done this with prayed and wanted these things for yours and he's making his way all right we thank you verse 22 seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever now how are you born you were born by the word what is the new birth it's the birth of the word that you have heard in that that has always been the new birth no matter what age or what it is it's the birth of the word so then we thank God for that ok now second Peter yes Simon Peter a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and though Jesus our Lord according at his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us now war to - glory to a glorified body - always Anglo in to his virtue - glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature escape the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue to virtue knowledge to and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity amen you might be seated the Lord Aires and his blessing to the reading of the word now what have we been doing for quite some time speaking on the stature of a perfect man that you see back here behind us and and all in trying to get us to a position to understand you know to walk in the light of his love all right now as I've said to you the day of Pentecost the disciples came forth after being tutored for the three and a half years of their time with the Lord Jesus and when the Holy Ghost fell it placed them positionally in the body of Christ giving them what we would be calling the faith of the fathers you know the revelation the the thing of the Father has given it unto us and Peter's see actually he he's over here as I was emphasizing the other day that you take acts 1 and 2 especially acts 2 you get in to Peter and his expressing of Jesus Christ coming up and what's happening and and the bringing forth you know other things and then the Holy Ghost falls on the 3,000 outside but I've tried to emphasize that point to you that 120 they were in the upper room and when God gave them the new birth the he gave it to them right here where it says holy spirit that's why people can't understand brother Branham they get him all confused and an understanding but then what happened was that the 3000 outside they could not be borned are they were born babies right here and had to grow so Peter names telling us and that's what Peter was doing Peter was expounding the Word of God to those people that were gathered outside and explaining about the Holy Ghost and this is that which was spoken of by the prophets and then things you know and as it come forth then they received the new birth with that new birth put them at faith or the new birth is booting you born babes desiring the sincere of milk of the word it didn't put him where the disciples were because it would put all that and and my point I've tried to I try to make illustrations or no one maybe I'll lose you in the illustrations but just like that God didn't use somebody even when the Holy Ghost fell he didn't use some of the others that were maybe capable he used Peter to explain about the baptism of the holy ghost that had happened you know when the Holy Ghost had fallen there and all in bringing through acts 1 and then he gets into and he explains of things because God doesn't use a novice to write the word he doesn't use a just a child a baby to write his word he uses someone that's seasoned in the gospel will see then Peter goes right on and he writes this message and he said I'm sending this to those that are of like precious faith those that had the new bird like him had eternal life in their soul by receiving Jesus Christ as their Savior and he said now I'm sending as to that group of people to where they can be able to come to where we are all right then he brings it forth and and shows them just add to your faith virtue to virtue knowledge knowledge temperance and patience and by bringing those things to bring the people to where they were all right that's why the Prophet then when he came he preached the message on the Statue of a perfect man explaining these things you know that you can't just say well well I'm born again I got everything no that won't work they ought to be sensible to know it won't work but yet being sensible enough then someone I have to tell you it's not enough you you've got to grow as a natural child you eat to grow all right so in the spiritual children you got to eat the Word of God study the Word of God you know pray and and see God and ask him to reveal these things to you instead of just saying oh I believe that let it be a part of you and if you have the new birth you will desire right isn't it what we read you'll desire said we'll desire the sincere milk of the word that we may grow thereby because he that would be part of your life why wouldn't you want to grow in Christ why would that not be your desire to want to know more about God well I know enough about what do you what do you mean you know enough about him you know you when we get out of here we won't even know enough about him because we'll be able to go down through the endless ages of time with receiving Christ's word alright but see that's what we've been trying to express to show why that people don't understand brother Browns message is because they try to take their understanding and by taking their understanding it will go in the wrong way even though they can bring the word to the letter you know but it still doesn't bring it in the right order and that's the one thing I've emphasized lately to you that we just read the statue of a perfect man with faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godless brother they come but what about each one of those things that we've studied we found out that we must depend and I've always believed this like I said God don't use a novice throughout his work so I've depended upon all of my life I hope you have to the fact that the Bible says that we're built on the foundation apostles prophets Jesus Christ being the chief Cornerstone you know and build on what those apostles tout of the Lord Jesus Christ because they had a personal experience and you and I must have that experience and and walk in those things and not be satisfied to just be well okay you know okay and then especially not get confused when we get into the Bible enough to try to study the statue of a perfect man we found some very interesting spots there that looks confusing but they're perfectly right if we wait upon the message of the hour all right now remember sister Shepherd I believe it was the dream that she had that the messenger was pouring the message into the church which was the water he was pouring into the pyramid top of it and it was washing out all of the trash and everything well see that's what the message is supposed to do it's supposed to wash out all of our clean out a lot of our trash and get us settled in the word all right and in doing it we found some very art to me it's been very interesting because I like to look at things as to what the Prophet says all right and then walk with what he's talking about and then I can study the scriptures and see what it's talking about and see that he's bringing us the Word of God all right but he's bringing it according to understanding for the time all right so then we we've taken each one of the virtues you know faith works or knowledge temperance patience it's not a virtue actually faith is a birth we've been over that enough but still we can just talk about virtues you know in time but it's actually faith is actually a birth all right but what about the examples now that has been given in what we've done let me run through them real quick and maybe it won't lose people from months of services that I've tried to bring let me just run through this I wrote it down exam of this this and just think about these things for a minute and consider it alright now we must understand the message by way of the Holy Spirit revealing what the messenger has brought to us right I mean the Bible didn't change I mean did you have certain Bible back to iron and then in doing so you say well y'all have a funny Bible well I've just plain-old Scofield I mean I have this one and everybody says they got a King James Schofield they don't they have a I have right off from the King James because you don't have King James versions anymore it's 1611 then you don't have those you can hardly even find them to order them all right but we've tried to take some of the words and be able to discover words because we're human beings we do things by words right we talk my words we're we're very funny though because you know we would say to people over you all in y'all and stuff like that and we were all messed up in our different language statements a lot of times but we at least can understand that's why I've always said that you go up north and you say I want some tomatoes and potatoes well we really say it matters and taters well they just live like everything that's it because they pronounced it to make toes and potatoes but you know what I've never failed yet to get what I ordered now they may be sniggering as they walk away how long but they always bring me what I'm asking because they understand when I say mater's and taters because if you're educated and got more knowledge than I've got you you ought to be able to understand what I say you know because that's just language but that's just illustrating but not totally the point I want you to see is because I believe the understanding of each one of the virtues in the actual points that's being brought is very very vital to understanding all right and see if we don't take what he says and lay it in order then we're going to get the wrong understanding of wordings what is Philadelphia named brotherly love would you mind looking behind me on the pyramid and finding brotherly love go brotherly love is a six church age on one shot of the frame that you're trying to brain but on the other it's the seventh church AIDS now which one's right both well how can both be right because it's what you're taking what you understand it all right see we talked about faith brother branham brings out in the stature of a perfect man that you're born again by faith faith in God and he said then what is a what is faith it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you so it's not natural wording is it it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personal to you alright now quick run through what we get to night we went to virtue it's odd isn't it that brother branham will if you read brother branham and try to read the Bible without reading it with understanding you're confused because brother Branham says rather than the kindness vii church age takes the rapture and I remember this happened years ago so not doing off on the man but 1971 - brother mote was preaching on the statue of perfect man and a man came by here and he said Don what are you in prison he told him a little bit he so that sounds real good we said let me study it out little mote said well I preached about 65 sermons on if you're welcome to them you know to save you time studying out a lot of things if you want to take it just listen oh let me figure it out myself he said I'll come back and preach it well he came back in about three or four months and he preached the rapture was gonna take place in the sixth church age because he had a quote from brother Branham that the rapture comes into brotherly kindness I'm serious this happened this Minister preached that the rapture was gonna come in the sixth church age because of the understanding of the word brotherly kindness as to Philadelphia which means brotherly love well I it's a very much understanding to that no brother they'll I can't even understand what you're talking about that's crazy to be thinking like that well that's true but that's what people think we take our own idea and then we try to mold the message into our frame or our ideas or methods or points to try to make it what we want it to be No and so I told you what the Prophet said what do we find out about virtue virtue in the natural means to be a virgin the Prophet said now that's not applied in this age like this this we're like that it does virtue doesn't mean to just be a virgin so you could be a virgin be as mean as rattlesnake you know what I mean you could be a natural virgin and be a Bonnie and Clyde situation you know you could be a murderer or whatever he said it's not that see it's really a virtuous life lived by Jesus Christ not just a virgin point being a virgin is wonderful honorable you know all that but it's not what if talking about in the statue of a perfect man so you could be a natural virgin say well well I'm a virgin I bet I I've got that one that's it I got that virtue no the probably said that's not what it is well then we must take his understanding if that's not what it is right so we go from virtue we go into knowledge now we know knowledge is not natural terminology of the word knowledge this is Holy Ghost knowledge you can have one person standing there to be able to quote the entire Bible by memory and the other one maybe like me couldn't quote John 3:16 hardly from memory and I'm not joking I have trouble with scriptures that away because I don't depend on trying to memorize it I depend on trying to see what it's talking about we see this person's got it totally down he's got knowledge but what is it by his ownself interpretation we had knowledge that we've heard before we heard of this message right but we've Trinitarians Whitman who's baptizes and Father Son Holy Ghost come on till you get what I mean you say I've got knowledge I memorized the Bible that's not what knowledge is that's Holy Ghost knowledge that's knowledge to know what did we cover it the prophets say the knowledge to know that Matthew 28:19 does not contradict acts 2:38 see that's the kind of knowledge he was bringing holy ghost knowledge all right then we went from knowledge or nothing to to the next was temperance and he said now temperance here and this is not talking about not drinking alcohol we'll see that's our natural word of understanding it would relate to to not drink it out he said now that's not so he said in this case here it's done so all right in that case he's not talking about not drinking alcohol he's talking about your temper he's talking about your long tongue right did we read them did we go through the Prophet talking about those things how to control your tongue we'll see if we took the natural meaning of the words where would we be take the natural meanings of the word brother then I've got faith I believe in them and I live a good life you know I've always been a virgin and everything I was a little good and I got a good knowledge of the word and that you know and and I don't mind my temper I control my temper and everything well you could do every bit of that and still be lost is that what brother brother says blasphemous name statue a perfect man he said people have a portion of these virtues without even being born again you got good neighbors around you right somebody you can depend on you need help that come and help you they do anything in the world for you right but that don't make them a Christian right so you can't put them in heaven because of what you do or don't do all right but you understand what I'm getting at see I'm getting at the point that we must take what he says to be able to understand what the Bible is saying so that it wouldn't be temperance is not drinking alcohol that wouldn't be the definition all right it may not mean a thing in the world to you but it means everything to me to look at the Word of God like that did I see what he's saying I'm not looking at the words he says yet that's the only way we can hear come on but I'm really trying to get the point of what he's saying see most people are only listening to your wordings to be able to refute what you're saying so they're listening to what you say you said so-and-so but I didn't mean that well you said it I meant this and no meaning of like that you ever been that away I said no yeah I know I'm the only confused nut in the building that's all right I believe God loves the nut anyway you got a house nuts I hold a boat sometime all right I'll just go along with that all right because this is the way I've always been I try to look at what rudder on him is saying instead of the words he's saying now that does that sound confusing you know I go exactly about what he says well that's all right but sometimes you're gonna get massively confused what did he say Judas went hung his sail and you go do likewise now I just said two scriptures are you gonna do it no cause that ain't what the Scriptures talking about right see we're quoting the word let me use the word run around use one day we're coating the word really coating it instead of quoting it because we're coating it over to try to make it say what we want it to say right all right see then we got into patience and patience was what he said having patience even with God to wait on God and realizing God is working out things and all that one fits pretty good in all the natural and the spiritual is the word patience because it's just a natural word to be used of that form alright but then we got to godliness and brother Branham looked and he said five dictionaries trying to find a meaning for the word godliness well he probably looked at five of them that told the definition of godliness as to be in pious are being ever how you pronounce those big word godly or deities or whatever but that wasn't what he was looking for you remember that one what was he looking for he was looking for an understanding of godliness that was what he knew Peter was saying you know he was getting what Peter was saying not what the words they spelled on the page but getting the point remembered had to come from the Greeks and the things down to the English so you lose a lot of meaning on things you know and that's why people get confused on it but that West we were going through gardening as we talk about what it was to be like God then he turns around and hardly takes the scriptures and says now this is the way your godly he takes you the acts tasty - Matthew 28:19 to be therefore perfect right read for statue a perfect man come on we need and he goes immediately to Matthew 5:5 48b is therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect what do you realize then if we have these virtues in us we're just as perfect as God is right let's see we looking at the meaning of the word godliness to just see some pious state or some great holiness or some something we could do none of these virtues has to do with what we can do remember I didn't speak on it that much but remember the peacock to have peacock feathers right not to have a buzzard putting peacock feathers in and saying I'm a peacock no don't worry about it just get born again that's what I've always tried to express to thee we went through the the message part because you remember me in the background of it as saying it I wondered how in the world could we get these virtues you know how could we get them when I knew there was demanded of us to have until one day God spoke to them and said by the opening of the word they will be brought to you well what is oh my what is my goal to open the word to speak by the open word to try to bring the things that God is prompt and where did we break 327 Church age book right this messenger Malachi 4 do 2001 turn the hearts of fit children back to the faith of fathers and he said it would be they kneeled to via reveal the thunders which is revelation contained in the seven seals and said to me these divinely revealed mystery truths now I'm quoting over brighter that will literally turn us back with why would we not want to know all about the seals and the things of the message I thought we believed sister Shepherd the part of her dream that we'll get to in a minute that the that was water flowing down and coming in a natural looking but when the acid what about this he said that's that's that's not water he said that's the Holy Spirit he said the Holy Spirit is boiling out all of these things says you can't hold the Holy Spirit in anything said it won't stay in no organization it won't do this for that of the other right it won't won't be done you can't do that with the Holy Spirit but then what did this takes it was was running over boiling out the trash then what happened somebody took honey and poured it in well I believe that somebody was the church age messenger well you want to believe it enough I kind of believe that's the way it is but it doesn't say that way he just says that then the whole brotherly kind of the honey was poured in and said that represents brotherly kindness now that's going to be very valuable in a few minutes if we have time to get to it to understand something about the honey because honey is the most wonderful thing there is as far as natural purities and things and as far as all over the world it's the same you get no out no vitamins no things no trees no watermelons no this that all over the world's gonna be this I but honey all over the world is the same made the same comes out to same taste this night wonderful for the Prophet to use it isn't that okay why did he get it why does he the one that calls brotherly kindness to honey and he said it will hold but it don't look like it right but it will hope all right now you following me so then we went from we're up on brotherly kindness now all right now to look at brotherly kindness you can read the statue of a perfect man and and follow through out there what the Prophet is saying about it and how the what it is and what it represents and the things but I want you to think with me for a minute in the natural wording of the word Philadelphia it means brotherly love the city of brotherly love that's what it's called what now the Prophet then took it now listen he took it in the studying of the church ages and the laying in order of the ages and he takes Philadelphia as the sixth church age because that's what the scripture brings it you know were you coming through you know is you're you're coming forth now looking for what I'm talking about so you got Paul then you got Iranians Martin and then you got Philadelphia through Wesley and it's called brotherly kindness and that was called the brotherly kindness age the age of Wesley because of the missionary endeavors now I'm quoting brother Branham I got him laying here in front of all right that's the missionary endeavors called it to be then the age of brotherly kindness but one would Peter put his six thing is to be godliness and then he would bring his seven thing to be brotherly kindness anybody got the answer I'm not being sarcastic I'm being serious what is the answer why is it there like that I've tried to illustrate on all the others if you listened virtue doesn't mean a virgin life it had a deeper meaning than a virgin life you know just to be a virgin it had a deeper meaning because it went into the spiritual aspect of a virtuous life lived in Christ and to live that life so that others can see and receive strength you remember that from strength from us are you or whatever you know as you're living before them huh well see there's an i it would it not be no I thing to continue the same pattern yeah I just expressed it to our second ago enough to where did you come down to what do you get then you get to knowledge you get to temperance you get the patience then you get to godliness well I now to take the natural definitions of each of those words does not give you the spiritual revelation do you understand what I'm doing I mean you understand what I'm trying to do I'm trying to get you to use that thing called the brain right no I want the Holy Ghost you can't get it nowhere except through the brain I don't mean you don't receive I don't mean you see the whole ago I mean faith comes by hearing and hearing comes by hearing the word is got to come through the brain to get to the rest it can't be it's not quick until you out in your hand and then you eat it it's only quickened when it can come within you and be made alive within you will see the natural wordings in the natural wordings won't get it that to me now listen that's to me it's why the people don't understand well brother branham would preach the statue of perfectly and yet right in the midst of all of trying to express it to you remember the thoughts we brought out that Paul and Peter is preaching the same thing letter Brendan said they never met they did for just a little bit and then Paul and Peter separated you know and they come back years later Paul and Peter were preaching at same time well what was Paul preaching that was the statue of a perfect man or what was Peter preaching that was Paul's adoption you see they were expressing in different ways what God was trying to reveal Paul was telling about the adoption and using the natural form of it of adopting and then adopting your own children into the family etc until you come out with the nature of the Father and come to the point where you can be trusted all that speaking on adoption he was speaking on the statute of perfect man that's what Peter was saying Peter's told me add to your faith virtue knowledge templates places caught in brotherly kindness when got to it yet brother own calls it the true baptism of the Holy Spirit see people go haywire I've heard doctrines on it now come on not throwing off on nobody but I've heard dr. and say if you got the Holy Ghost you got turned up down upside down you know you're gonna have to go out to put that and turn it upside down and the statement I read to you the other week and preach to you we're right around the edge you come all this way to godliness and said you were coming up to patience since it you ain't got to hold a ghost yet well I've had people to throw that in my face brother Brennan said we got to Holy Ghost yet we know what I agree with him that most people don't have the Holy Spirit that's what's wrong if they had the Holy Spirit there wouldn't be so much confusion with its natural people with natural terminologies or words trying to understand a spiritual word to me the entire Bible is written that away like a told you Paul would say the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ God and Father there's got to be two of them then we get all confused and it's thoughts like that with a simple illustration you just translate the word and to even and that's perfectly right in the scripture so it is God even father of our Lord Jesus Christ now you're not confused and just like brother branham will bring out he said to understand the Godhead to what I'm a father I'm a son I'm a human being I'm a General Motors employee or formerly pastor a church I got many many titles but I got one name I got one personality trying to be displayed right there's you understanding garbed in because that's what he does see to understand the Godhead is simple because the Bible said it that could be understood by the things that we see but I'm trying to get you to do I told you I said no we're gonna have problems when we get a little further along you remember a few weeks ago I said you think maybe this is confusing about virtue and virgin and that don't mean this way and and in temperance and things don't mean this it means this and I said we get a little farther we get on the brother countenance we're really gonna get confusing because you simply look at the pyramid behind you look at it it's totally off as far as natural concerns Philadelphia is supposed to be brother kindness if we take the natural words on here but if we take God's revealed word in Logan to us the sorts a beautiful picture of a marvelous thing that a prophet is the one who brings the message see no theologian can figure that out a theologian would want to say okay the best thing for us to do is we need to swap these two guys in in these two ages and kind of put them around in a different place and you know and give it a little understanding but now that wouldn't want Peter say it and that's why brother ran him to see like I said when he'd come he said you got all the way up here to to godliness the six-lane godliness and he said you ain't got the Holy Ghost yet people just go haywire well no we said watch the Prophet see it no you didn't now that's what's so hard to try to convince people to show them that they're standing there lying through their teeth to you the sound say it want the prophets it will not any 42nd because he said you had to hold a ghost when he was born again at the bottom of the pyramid the same Holy Ghost they come on the day of Pentecost but you see that's where people take their own ideas and they say you got to change this you got you you can't make this go to that no but what are you gonna do with it well I don't need to understand that you goofed by thinking that because you're saying that brotherly kindness is a six church age and the Prophet said this brotherly kindness was the age of the rapture and you're saying the rapture is gonna come into six church age and six church age Pais a long time ago right my right you don't have to agree with me I'm just asking them you explained it some other way it's got to be something the Bible and the the Prophet has got to be saying the same thing and they've got to be saying what Peter said you know in the correct order of the way Peter was saying it so Peter is the one that said add to your faith virtue knowledge temperance patient godliness brotherly kindness and then headstone which is Christ the only thing brought around him ever done he just took it from faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and he said true baptism with the holy God they were going to get to the statements they let on my - don't worry about it don't get confused we're brother Branham says is God coming down through Christ Holy Spirit God coming down through Christ Holy Spirit welding all of this together and that's it perfectly exactly right because you see that's where we need to understand instead of just taking something well I can understand brother so enjoy even yeah oh yeah and we knew you're 40 years old to hold your hand up just night with me can you say ABCs [Music] like anonym says about it you know people come in to scoop and they bring their little kid to the first grade or kindergarten you know well my little boy he knows is a B's rolling my visas abcdefgh I think and then the teacher says would you go over on the board and point out a No well you don't know what a B yes what to see you only done is memorized it that's what people's done with this message is memorized it and that's wonderful but I don't try to memorize it I don't try to read that to memorize er I'm not joking you for you to tell me to quote the Lord's Prayer I would miss it I guess because I've never tried to memorize God's Word I've tried to study it leave it lay and let him pick it up when he needs it and see that way then you just go down the road don't worry about it okay but you remember what I said Sunday I said well my party right or maybe it was life's nothing the wonderful greenie huh if there's anything I've ever enjoyed doing he's taking things that looks contrary one to the other one and let God show the truth about it it'll bring a great revelation to your heart and peace and joy within you to realize that God has spoken to you in all of the mass confusion that is around us in the message the mass confusion of mankind studying this Bible of the theologians the people that writers are doing the comparing the memories inside and how that they missed God with a little seventh grade education man walk out to her and God could speak to it you know he could tell you what Peter was talking about you know why am i right he had experienced it you can only tell what you've experienced [Music] what did the thing with a warming up unit the Statue of Liberty I've been by it and looked at it out the window of a bush but I so tired from riding twelve hours from Israel the light II didn't get the camera up to take a picture you know but you know there's been people been all up in that I said I've been out in the front of it but I never been up in it what are you saying I'm saying if we haven't experienced anything how can we explain it how can you explain something you've not experienced well this is what I thought see very important that's what he said this is what I find all right what are you winning now to think about it isn't it odd and I got these laying out here in front of them if you want it word that Philadelphia is the age of Brotherly are the the Philadelphia is the word used for the city of Philadelphia that means brotherly love not brotherly kindness and the Prophet says that this is the age of brotherly kindness well what age are we in are we in the 6-2 age of the seventh age you see what I'm talking about I'm trying to get you to look at something from a natural point of words and letters and things that to show you that words and letters will kill you Paul said the letter killeth with the spirit giveth life the revealed word brings life you know what I'm talking about you remember the day you saw water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it opened your eyes didn't it and it opened the Bible I remember when first seeing it called name you know when when somebody said to me who brought them all talking about the name or whatever I remember then everywhere I read in the Old Testament even every time I'd read scripture I'd run across the word name you know I said that's a great word name need to look it up one of these days and find out what all that means name because it just what you're about in you car go buy you a new car and you get you a a purple something Lamborghini or something some kind of fancy looking car you know and you get one of one certain color and nobody's got one like that right I've never seen this color before it is beautiful I'll go buy it because I'm only one's got it you get in the car and you drive about three blocks and you see two of them same color right that's the way we do spiritually we think just because things fits together for us that it's right I've took them old Ruby screws and my knife and cut that thing in two because I never could get them together you know taking a hand it over to one of the kids and they go your daddy same thing with a computer Richard come fix the computer is left out I'm just a little bit above Dagwood cuz he had that little buddy of his next door you know a little boy but them little boys they can figure that hang out but come on now listen to what I'm saying why would it be that brother branham wouldn't know and say it how many of them do you need of statements from brother branham where he talks about how that the Philadelphia Church age was the age of brotherly love now how many of them do you need there's one that's all for the Ephesian Church age - the church age is called the Philadelphia church age because he's referring to back to the - who it was about west linda.thank Philadelphia Church age likes it from 1750 to about 1906 this age due to the meaning of the name of the city has been called the age of brotherly love as Philadelphia means brother love of the Brethren and that's the Wesleyan six church age but why would it come up see then to come up into brotherly kindness to your virtues and things and how you come out to garden and this he said then to brotherly love brotherly brotherly kindness and then love on would he be making these things why would he go into the next on blaspheme his name and he talks about a brotherly kindness the age that we live in now okay which age do we live in which age are we living in here if we're in Philadelphia under the natural world we're still in the sixth church age but now here the Prophet says the seventh church age the age we're living in right now it's brotherly kindness is he so confused what about it he said no we live in the lady of sia huh now let's take that for a minute what does lady will see a man who knows people's rights is that the only definition in God subjects opens that the only definition you got since the named Lady of SIA means the people's rights our justice of the people the people's right lady of see you trying to get you to look at Lego see it for a second then we drop backwards okay go ahead number nine number eight brother they're pulling him 1:42 just one more one more time Lord it's exactly right what you said is exactly right and he come to me he was telling me the lady of sin means woman in Greek this is a woman's world it's a woman's church it's a woman's age there's a little more to it than just to be lady you'll see of being people's rights because we know that the woman's this in a lot of it right but you know also there is a group of people in the lady of seeing age that is a woman that is beautiful and perfect and described in the Word of God as to being in Revelations one Girt about the paps with a golden girdle talking about a bride he said we don't look at it on those foreigners do it lady your CEO means women woman this is a woman's world okay investments we find out now that we're becoming in our age and then you Bible teacher knows that the life stage of Pentecost is Lady of seal lady OC a means woman in the Greek the town like the woman takes over all right but he said anybody can see that that life stage is a Pentecostal age the Pentecostal age is the Lady of seeing age are you in the reading what he's saying okay we're gonna get back on the board in a second so hold on to it look at identifications the next one you talk about Pentecostals now because we're going over here to represent something Pentecost isn't it a strange thing that the Pentecostals listen is this modern age that the Bible predicts will be the lady of seeing so not that Pentecostal is not bride right come on are you following the point that is the Pentecostal age I'll tell my two bride come about the Pentecostal age is the lady of seeing age now we're gonna read in a minute that this age is the brotherly kindness age mmm well I don't understand what okay hold on the rapture number four number eleven Enoch was raptured 2/7 showing that it's the seventh church age that takes the rapture that's just in case somebody's out there wondering if brotherly love means six and we're going up in the rapture in a six church a just to give you that from brother Branham it's gonna be the seventh Church age we're living in the seventh church age we're not living in the sixth you'd be surprised how people are sealed from narrow-minded it's a that's church age it takes the rapture all right what is it what about it what about it well what are you trying to get at what are you trying to say I'm trying to say what the Prophet said when he told a sister's dream and he told it in blasphemous names and she dreamed and she wondered if she had she saw all this and saw the pouring of the water in and it boiling out and saw the man take the hunting pour it in and it holds and he gave her the interpretation she had to dream he preached the message a few months after her dream she comes back to him and tells him her comes to him and said you know I had that dream he goes back it was in that period of time she was shown the church the pyramid and she saw the water running down and she wondered if she had to hold a ghost or not you remember where we got started on this all right there how do you know you got the baptism when the holy God give me your evidence of the Holy Ghost I believe the message so does the devil I've shouted I've cried I've spoken in tongues I've done all these things I've seen visions I've seen angels I've seen all kinds of thing does that mean you're born again there's only one evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's whether or not the spirit in you agrees with the word right now looking at Philadelphia as been brotherly kindness and putting it down here and then remember we've got to bring brotherly kindness up to the seventh church age for this this age is doing in this the age of the brotherly kindness what's that it may get confusing in your mind so you may ask how to ask the Holy Spirit to keep it straight what you see this is the age the message was being poured into the church all right but the body itself in all together like it's not no words not that way but what man who was pouring the water the messenger to the church poured the message into the church but what was the water doing it was boiling out all of the trash and that's what the Holy Ghost does it balls it up like the Holy Ghost do we have the Holy Spirit the rent of the new birth I've asked you that over and over because it's the most serious matter you could ever think of in your life it's not what Trump's gonna do tomorrow it's not nothing like that ain't got nothing to do with it it's whether you're born again or not you say well what's brought being born again got to do with the with what you're telling my stature ferment thought if you're not born again what the prophets say he said you gotta have this this this this and he said you can't even start unto you how this which is the new birth you can't start the statue of perfect man without the new birth well do we have those virtues do we have the new birth do how the virtues I just spent my time trying to get away from the the point of it being so hard to understand what virtues mean virtues means a life of Christ it's his virtues it's not mine head to your faith it's given unto you you're born again he gives you the faith you are born again within his head whose virtue as God's virtue has to be added it's God's knowledge it has to be added he has to add these things to you and I and you remember what we brought out we brought out into prophets showed it statue a perfect man that a man with these virtues would be able to qualify for the rapture with what if we don't have them come on what if we don't have these virtues well brother there you mean we're lost no I didn't say is lost I didn't say you lost if you don't have a new birth you're lost that's sensible that's plain but the virtues is a growth development in the statute of a perfect man just like the growth development of a child growing up or a person growing up just like adoption and the child growing up to the to the father being able to trust them [Music] and then you say well we're brother Dale then what is it cause brother branham you know I read them enough to where you could see it I read enough to her that you can see that Philadelphia means brotherly kindness we get brotherly kindness is up above Philadelphia can you get that together what is your thought [Music] see to the natural world Philadelphia literally means brotherly love [Music] but now listen to this statement [Music] what about brother branham talking of amazing kind of how that between the 6th and 7th church age there's an amazing thing you remember how he taught throughout the church ages and overlap from one to the other it always overlaps like a star step walking up it overlaps right each age overlaps each other you start off Paul as a foundation seeing you keep coming up not to the natural world of Philadelphia does mean and to the church age itself it was the age of brotherly kindness the six church age the six church age was the age of brotherly love missionary endeavor sand all over the world but then that was true and false fine brother Brennan said in the Philadelphia Church age page 298 he said really that lady Oh seal the life stage in many respects is simply carry on of the sixth age what about that see if you listen you'll see why it is to the world it's Philadelphia brotherly kindness that means six but to the bride it's brotherly kindness which means the honey that was poured in after the Holy Ghost boiled out all the tribes right go look but the life stage is in many respects simpler carry over on over six the seventh age a very short age gathers up into itself one quick work all the evil of every age and yet all the reality of Pentecost I'm just leaving it wrong say all of the world and the evilness but all of the reality of Pentecost how did you mean that once the Philadelphian age has about run it of course the lady of CNAs will quickly comes in brings both the tires and the wheat to the harvest so now there's no problem see to the bride in Wesley's age [Music] they was in brotherly kindness you know because that was the time of the age I was doing for missionaries brotherly kindness shown to the world and gone you know but it just simply carries where I don't over into lady of SIA lady you'll see a doesn't become Philadelphia lady osya becomes the seventh Church age that the messenger can pour the honey into messenger pours remember the sisters dreamed up go back to blast name is names and read the water be important he said that was the messenger pouring the message this message has been boiling out that's why we're here fifty years after the going of the Prophet to try to give us time to get ready to understand the message I see then when it falls over into this age this is the age of brotherly kindness you know the definition brother Brennan gave he said you love your brothers and things but said you differ a little bit and said you part you pull apart in time he said but let something happen to that brother said you just said you hurt at your heart because there were your brother he's explaining explaining brotherly kindness to be greater than to just be a missionary even we're bringing it down to individuals and brotherly kindness the honey of brotherly kindness will hold all right now hold on for a second you can't draw it out on this drawing because it's not there but brother Branham says there's a little flange right here it made perfectly to fit I've drawed it many times and draw it to pyramid come down bring it across and make the part to where they'll fit together a little flange there's that true baptism of the Holy Spirit the honey that boils out all the trace gets pulled out by the Holy Ghost but the honey is this message quickened into our hearts and lives well there's honey in the rock my brother that's what we need we need the baptism of the Holy Ghost yes we get that at faith that is the new birth but we still got one little time to go where brother Brennan says that the headstone comes down and seals it all together we won't deal with that tonight we'll deal with that later but he says it's a statue of perfect land I've encouraged you to read that message over and over and over in brotherly kindness what would that be would it not be this message poured in to its total purity to not just boil out the trash now are you listening Little Rock box water poured in it it was running out going down the side of the pyramid and even brother Ron says blaspheme his name so he said God accepted her foundation because she was worried whether she had to hold his period or not and he showed her by the dream that she had the Holy Spirit II said God accepted her foundation what is her foundation faith is the foundation of the statue of a perfect man he showed her she was born again God accepted her faith the Holy Ghost poor come in with a messenger East messenger pouring in the message it would boil out to trash Paul's day Iranians Martin Columbo Luther Wesley Wright ball in the trash out but there was one messenger left that would be yourself that seventh one wouldn't be just porting the message in the ball out to trash he'd be pouring the love of God the honey the brotherly kindness is the honey that's what your prophet says it's the honey that's poured in that honey will hold you know what that honey does you get that Rock box it pours in it sets up tight well what happens when you pull the top down on it it's gonna squeeze out what it's not needed where's that going we'll get to it next we're not going it goes outside and it seals ever aged together the honey is what's doing the sealing the prophets message your sealing you in and sealing others out that's why it's brotherly condition ballin I mean Peter wouldn't wrong brother Brendan wouldn't wrong but Ren wouldn't wrong when he says brotherly kindness is the sixth church age Philadelphia then he turns and says brotherly kindness is the seventh church age he wasn't wrong he just carried over from the 6th over into the seventh just let that come down on the end sit on you squeezy with it then you got the thing but I run him said he said then there is the true baptism of the holy spirit that's a direct quote out of statute of perfectly true baptism what is a true baptism it doesn't mean salt like in comparison of true and false it's perfect realization what is the honey of this message two seals you in to the word that's been revealed to you the whole pyramid is sealed in by the honey as it goes down and sealed everything then it is God coming down through Christ Holy Spirit that's not trinitarianism that's exactly what has taken place the whole world is waiting on you and I adoption time when God can pour in and my quotient Road around him and God can pour in his fullness be there's a honey there that we need sure it's love for the Brethren it's love for one another it's brotherly kindness it's love but really it's this message going into the total maturity it's what sealing us we're sealed by the word that God has delivered this prophet brought the message listen I'm asking you listen to what weight is bringing on shut up man that was the first message I preached in 1969 that the bride would be the son of man that's quoting brother Branham then as much as I could how much now listen to it well son of man son of man is resurrection I come on charge I don't mean this sarcastic we we Baptists studied about the son of man being the resurrection why because jesus said I am the resurrection and the life so we didn't understand nothing of what we're talking about but we did at least we're able to read some of the word and believe it the son of man is the resurrection that's why brother Branham would stand there and he'd say bring me twenty four of your worst cases and I'll guarantee you healing for everyone who said that a man said it that was believing where he stood and that did not make him God but it made him the closest thing to God that there was I don't mind saying that just make sure you don't say that I said he was God because there's a lot of difference between the two he said you don't understand the Son of Man that's what I've always said it jerk the Apostle Paul never talked about the Son of Man none of those apostles preached anything about the Son of Man right no no come on give me scripts and talk about Matthew Mark Luke and John wrote I'm talking about the writers in the Bible show me where they said one word about son of man but what about a little old prophet walking out there about somewhere around I think the first time it's somewhere close to 50 or 51 it's not right in 47 don't fight I believe it's about 50 or 51 but still think about a little old man walking out to our priests knowing son of pain what was brother branham's whole message based on something he understood now it's son of God mm-hmm so God makes way for son of man listen to what you're hearing but listen to it like I'm trying to tell you listen to try to understand what somebody's saying don't listen to the words they say that they say things and it comes out wrong you know you've been through that and listened and heard it do it what do they do radda radda Merced 700 Center 7,000 or 7,000 to the 700 they never heard another thing he said they were right they never heard what he said the rest of the message is only when this guy's confused it's supposed to be 700 I straightened him out on there I'm gonna go see him when the service is over and boy he blowed the bubble didn't he cuz you got a little bit over he said 900 which is right I just said it wrong but that's what I'm trying to illustrate that's what we do with this message we try to find something to argue with the other person instead of trying to understand what the person is saying you listening to a preacher in the pulpit you're setting out here boy you missed Outland we missed an appointment we just missed the whole message Jordan estate oh now my ride he said well I straighten him I services over I'm gonna tell him where he missed all these things here ain't no preacher I don't know I'm sure I'm humble I was no preacher listen but the Lord showed me what he didn't show him boy you're real good you say you're silly I agree we but he gets the point across this message revealed is the honey that you and I need because it will bind us together and seal us into one another that we want to argue doctrinal points we'll talk about Jesus and what he means to each one of us instead of a doctrinal issue that goes from the pulpit to the janitor so we'll take it for that this message was not made to argue it was made to be lived instead of arguing with I've never tried to study the message of the Bible in any way - just to try to find something - contrary to somebody else but I have found out by reading it that there was a lot of things was contrary hadn't you but I didn't do it to try to find it what about the co musicians what about it why would the prophets a lady ousia is brotherly kindness but he needs to say Wesley's age of Philadelphia its brother in the kindness you know he's right both places because it's what he's explaining one of them is explaining the natural wording of Philadelphia just like one of them was explaining the natural wordings of virtue or knowledge or temperance or patience or whatever and he was explaining natural things but then you take the spiritual and then open up the word unto you I hope you'll think about what I'm saying and go home and just consider that messenger was pouring the message in to the church to boil out the trash when he got the trash boiled out he didn't leave it in tea he went and got a bucket of honey and he poured that in there and it sealed up all the cracks sealed up everything that was left and there was nothing left for just love itself because once it poured in there of that the head has something to sit on the head has a body to unite with we'll get to that next I hope you followed me and what I brought down to little random what do you mean the true baptism to bring all of these virtues he said into the individual he said will bring you to the true baptism of the Holy Spirit so what do we need we need faith virtue knowledge temperance patience darling simply we need these virtues and if it's necessary for us to have them why would we not be concerned with it and want them let's tan Oh 119 River let's just think on these things brotherly kindness she's looking at it show that ain't gonna hold that ain't go home you said it'll hold Oh that honey was holding on to that true baptism not just anointed ones anything like that you even consider that on true Baptists you're talking about some something happening of positions in Christ to where he can come down and unite with mankind you gotta have that Holy Spirit as representing brotherly kindness in this age to work the unite in this age go tonight we got to go to another age well what do you think we need we need to read pray and study we need to study and pray [Music] we have the message to tell us what to do my brother Dave I might get confused like I've always said honey don't worry about it if you're afraid you already confused I have to stand here ever Services put on the line what I believe and why I believe it right I tell you what I believe and why I believe it what would be your problem with telling them come and telling me this is what I believe and why I believe it look if anybody ever need little random said that brotherly kindness he says hard in other words like an individual can do things but he says hard to do in a group [Music] some of you leave out of here ever service go out and won't even shake hands with nobody it's like your snubbing the whole thing what's the matter that ain't brotherly kindness you know what I do you see me I go to every one of yesterday I'll run you down to get you to shake my hand if I miss you it's your fault you ain't give me time I went to a church one time and preached for a brother and he was very well known for leaving the pulpit and walking out the back door I've never seen nobody when I finished I walked down off the platform walked out to the front of the church and started shaking hands it took him about 30 minutes that he finally found me if I had 500 people I'd shake 500 hands because I want you to know this is one brother that loves you I'm no worthy of anything but there's one thing about it within my heart is a love for people that I've give my heart to try to teach people the truth try to get people to see what brother branham's talking about that's my desire as it gets you to see Jesus Christ [Music] this is my story this is my song [Music] praising my say Oh bless you sure [Music] father we give this back off to her brother a contact the day and their sons going on a little trip so you be with them you take care of them give them a safe journey everything bring them back in Jesus [Music] anybody else this is my store this is smiles just remember what I've tried to say if you missed it brotherly kindness is the greatest seal you could ever consider the Prophet put it above the Holy Ghost seal he called it to true baptism to worthiness join everything together [Music] father we thank you we just asked you to go with us now as we go our separate ways take care of everybody give everybody a safe journey we love you and we thank you in Jesus name you dismiss [Music] watch [Music] whispers you
