[19:55] can't kill it all in one day he did it
[19:58] all in one day
[19:59] some phrase guys I'm gonna read from two
[20:02] places in the scripture this morning
[20:07] Genesis 1 and also Colossians 1 this
[20:11] morning ever started in Genesis Genesis
[20:16] 1 and our started verse I probably use
[20:19] the net to write down because I got
[20:22] caught a few scriptures Genesis 1 verse
[20:27] 26 to 28 Genesis 1 yes
[20:37] praise God just one verse 26 through 28
[20:44] and it reads like this and God said let
[20:49] us make man in our image itravel
[20:52] lightness and let them have dominion
[20:54] over the fish of the sea and over the
[20:57] fowl of the air and over the cattle and
[21:01] over all the creeping things that creep
[21:03] up on the earth so God created man in
[21:07] his own image in the image of God he
[21:10] created he him male female created he
[21:13] them and God blessed them and God said
[21:17] unto them be fruitful and multiply and
[21:19] replenish the earth and subdue it and
[21:21] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[21:25] and over the fowl of the air and over
[21:27] every living thing that moveth on the
[21:30] earth Colossians 1 first Colossians read
[21:39] from verse 15 and 16 and it says who is
[21:56] the image of the invisible God the
[21:58] firstborn of every creature for by him
[22:02] we're all things created that were in
[22:05] heaven and that are in the earth visible
[22:08] and invisible whether they be diminished
[22:11] or dominions or principalities or power
[22:15] all things were created by him and for
[22:18] his grace let us pray
[22:21] my gracious father helped me to heal my
[22:24] body one more time
[22:26] help me - you're my mind my spirit my
[22:29] soul Lord Lord just get out of the way
[22:32] Lord I thought I'd give you all my scrip
[22:34] for this service in the name our Lord
[22:37] Jesus Christ we pray amen god bless you
[22:41] you may be seated in one moment thank
[22:44] the Lord for the reading of the word of
[22:46] God this morning
[22:48] I like the way the Scriptures under God
[22:50] gave man Dominion created everything
[22:53] that were created was created by him and
[22:56] for him so by God's grace I'm taking my
[22:59] call up your game fighting work with a
[23:00] coat on so thank you love it yes and we
[23:09] find here in the book of Genesis here we
[23:11] find God who created man the held
[23:15] dominion ship how do that what man that
[23:18] was a perfect Verbier that we could
[23:20] become God of the ruler God put us in a
[23:25] position now what we've done with it as
[23:28] a good but God it was God will for man
[23:31] to have dominion over the earth how do
[23:35] you not have them complete complete
[23:38] rulership of the earth in other words so
[23:41] when God did this in man with their God
[23:44] put man in a body of flesh so make a
[23:47] rule hello in other word the legal way
[23:50] for man a ruler he had everbody hello so
[23:54] God put God stepped in a body in and
[23:57] gave at him when he took this body and
[23:59] stepped in this body and breathing Adam
[24:02] Adam II had dominion over the earth
[24:04] Holly we we look here we find here that
[24:07] in the scripture here that when God
[24:09] first created man how the man had he the
[24:12] rule over the fish of the sea over the
[24:15] fowls earlier and every living thing
[24:17] that move up on the face of the earth
[24:20] everything they had everything that was
[24:23] up on the earth everything that had life
[24:25] in it good
[24:25] God say Adam I want you to get dominion
[24:28] over this and anything that I want you
[24:31] to subdue to Earth if anything get out
[24:34] of order put it back in order how do you
[24:37] know what Adam I'm giving you this
[24:38] authority that keep everything in order
[24:40] how would that go do it you would speak
[24:43] the word and it would obey you
[24:45] haloo you double does that was a job you
[24:47] know they have dominion and and then and
[24:51] speak the word and and everything they
[24:53] move in everything that's up on your but
[24:56] we understand here that and I looked at
[24:59] the scripture that
[25:01] when God the first created man was
[25:03] trading God created man in his own image
[25:06] man didn't have all man did was to live
[25:10] it shouldn't be in always in here honey
[25:13] shouldn't be nobody shouldn't be getting
[25:15] older other God in creator's to get old
[25:18] now what we have a problem we get no we
[25:21] trying to make a self thing well I'm
[25:22] going to stay young fail but you show me
[25:24] your solution I'm tell you what Jarrett
[25:28] I won't hold you that is how that stuff
[25:31] is all with you does I do hit a certain
[25:33] point in life into you just get oh you
[25:35] know I mean you think you'd be thinking
[25:37] in your mind I'm gonna I feel just as
[25:40] good as I did when I was 16 you think
[25:41] that that's in your mind every oh this
[25:46] is just that point is just that good but
[25:49] there is something in man he want to
[25:51] stay young he want to feel youthful like
[25:54] he did when he was like 16 or 17 years
[25:56] old and everything but but we all get
[25:58] know her but we were not created to be
[26:00] that way you know when the God created
[26:03] man in I'm gonna do to cover it maybe
[26:05] read a couple of scriptures and I want
[26:07] you to know he never gave man time man
[26:10] never would when God created man his own
[26:13] him it man was created in the image of
[26:15] God created he him male female critic
[26:18] either God never did it man was never in
[26:21] time ha looser than what you find in
[26:23] Genesis 1 and verse 15 here we find her
[26:26] and the Bible said and the Lord God took
[26:29] the I took the man the Lord God took the
[26:32] man and put him in the Garden of Eden
[26:34] and to dress it and to keep it so he was
[26:38] a keeper and Genesis 1:16 we found her
[26:42] and then he came out of meat were and
[26:44] the Lord God a command gave him a
[26:46] commandment and sanity and and said unto
[26:50] the man of erage a tree under God and I
[26:54] may eat freely if you notice here he
[26:57] never put time in this I want you to eat
[27:02] and I want you to live and I want you to
[27:04] enjoy the blessings of God he never put
[27:07] time in his
[27:09] but if you notice in genesis of 17
[27:12] chapter of in a 17 verse he said but of
[27:16] the tree of knowledge of good and evil -
[27:19] you're not eat of it for in the day if
[27:23] you notice he put time in this heap let
[27:27] him know in that day in the time you do
[27:30] this that time you started to dive in
[27:32] the day that idea that day - it surely
[27:36] died so he put time in the day time in
[27:40] the pub where Genesis the the 6 he burn
[27:44] able to see freely but now Genesis 17 is
[27:49] day honey in the deluge of hunger that
[27:53] day should surely die in the word so
[27:55] Adam what he was sand Adam Adam you wash
[27:58] you do this you would never live a day
[28:01] in God terminology of the day was as a
[28:05] thousand years that was a thousand years
[28:07] was the other day and Adam today that
[28:10] you do it it will no man live up
[28:12] thousand years on earth so once Adam did
[28:16] I have never lived a thousand you do
[28:19] them little 969 Europe he died before
[28:22] the thousand year ago so we go back and
[28:25] pick up the millennia and live out a
[28:27] thousand your honeymoon and reread
[28:30] Christ
[28:31] cut the scripture can be broken so we
[28:34] begin to go ahead we find her and I look
[28:38] at these things right here in that we v
[28:39] we're going in Genesis here and run you
[28:42] see what my title is the power of
[28:45] Dominion and then were so adamant is
[28:48] dementia so we binder does he remember
[28:52] we always says Holly the devil took the
[28:55] UH the devil took the Adam diminisher
[28:58] that devil did not take Adam diminisher
[29:01] Adam gave it to him
[29:03] I don't want all the way to devil could
[29:05] do it
[29:06] devil could not get to Adam he had to
[29:09] come out to him either what a devil made
[29:12] me do it
[29:13] Holly the devil cannot make you do it
[29:15] you got the Holy Ghost the only way to
[29:17] definitely get to you you you gotta lay
[29:20] go to him here we go he did not come to
[29:23] you except going through the blood and
[29:25] he go through the bloody you'll be a
[29:27] brother that you saw hit him one do that
[29:30] so we begin to let go nothing's right
[29:32] there so but we begin to realize it and
[29:35] then we find here in Genesis so to Devil
[29:38] start talking we know discover here and
[29:40] in this relationship start between him
[29:43] and a heaven Eve then you know you
[29:47] started he start talking to her he
[29:49] didn't never come NAT him he would I
[29:52] knew but the point of it is here and I
[29:54] was studying a scripture here and I
[29:57] noticed here in the scripture you know
[29:58] the Bible says he was guilty of the
[30:02] transgression in the beginning right and
[30:05] you know you know you know but here it
[30:07] is Eve Hickel Satan he came to eat and
[30:09] then beginning to start his relationship
[30:12] with Tommy and in front here she was on
[30:14] Facebook it shouldn't be talking to him
[30:16] no way this intimate having this
[30:20] conversation no way know what she should
[30:22] be talking to her husband and it was
[30:24] somebody anyway but here they were that
[30:27] was in his little devils in his Laura
[30:29] romance going on here between the
[30:32] Serpent and Eve how do but deported me
[30:34] what we say that he was in the
[30:36] transgression she was guilty of the
[30:39] transgression I mean she was but the
[30:42] point of it was if you look at the story
[30:44] right he should had never been in this
[30:47] position you said my brother Joe how
[30:49] would you get there if Adam who had did
[30:53] what God told him to do he would Nellie
[30:56] wouldn't have never been gift is a
[30:57] transmission cloudiness anyway
[31:00] he woulda did did it if he was a ruler
[31:03] the way that God told him to if anything
[31:05] that move upon her
[31:07] you deal with it Adam why didn't he deal
[31:09] with this beast he should have deal with
[31:12] this be striker so evening you should
[31:15] not if his heart would have been order
[31:17] Adam Devine nation I've been in there
[31:20] maybe you said well she was guilty but
[31:22] when you go back to you read in Romans
[31:24] it says they had about one man
[31:27] follow God's it was seeing came into the
[31:30] world about one man rid of one man
[31:33] righteousness into him we come back to
[31:34] that but Adam should deal with this
[31:37] problem
[31:37] he should walked up to the sermon so
[31:40] what you talking to my wife honey oh
[31:42] yeah I don't tell you what I want to
[31:45] speak you out of existence and if he
[31:47] would have had done it Satan would have
[31:49] never been her everybody wouldn't be no
[31:52] ball hitting me as in her if he were to
[31:57] did his job the right way but you
[32:00] shouldn't he shouldn't have never been
[32:01] this away and because I did it
[32:04] Adam didn't rule he didn't take his
[32:06] lordship he didn't take his rulership
[32:08] over to Satan so now I don't have begin
[32:11] I had to deal with a different job he
[32:14] still had to deal rule of beasts he
[32:17] still had to have dominion over the
[32:19] beasts but to be said he dealing with
[32:22] now is different the Beast that he was
[32:25] to deal with the fishes to see a fishing
[32:28] of the cedar for a lady uh things that
[32:30] move on her he's still dealing with that
[32:32] beast he had to had to deal with the
[32:34] Beast that he deal with now is with
[32:36] venom now he still he's still dealing
[32:40] with and we still got to deal with this
[32:41] thing called the Beast
[32:43] how do you say brother joy you said I
[32:46] work what my be stuck I did when you
[32:48] look at it every morning huh every
[32:51] morning you look at this piece every
[32:53] morning you got to deal with so that's
[32:55] so now he
[32:55] it ain't that he it ain't that he didn't
[32:58] had he still had to deal with this beast
[33:00] my hero
[33:00] so now we find her and I'm gonna deal
[33:03] with a few scripture sir how do I get
[33:05] rid of my head you know what let me look
[33:06] at this thing that he got to deal with
[33:08] he's still got a rule the same write him
[33:11] because God put me her to rule the earth
[33:15] and the ruler I will be done in earth as
[33:19] it is in heaven
[33:20] how do you we are if you think God
[33:22] talking about how do you got to deal
[33:25] with this earth right here so then you
[33:28] begin to look at these things right here
[33:29] dad
[33:30] now I want you to notice that like you
[33:32] don't say you're not older people say oh
[33:35] yes I believe them in size I believe
[33:37] that the people that get too bad
[33:38] holy go it's preaching this message to
[33:41] prophet insight and we're done with the
[33:44] messenger prophet comfort so we can
[33:46] catch the mind of Jesus Christ and
[33:49] preach the word on the prophet in
[33:51] science I would man understand the mind
[33:54] of God without a your Norton of God
[33:56] coming up on you by the Holy Ghost
[33:58] how do you be will be impossible for you
[34:01] to sit down and take the Bible and
[34:03] understand about without the baptism the
[34:05] Holy Ghost
[34:06] so now what a probably come to us to
[34:08] take the word and make the word live for
[34:11] your day honey so we all need the
[34:14] anointed a prophet it in sight so we can

[41:59] way to show you we just use the
[42:01] scriptures there that we a proper got

[43:01] Ghost and let me show you how powerful
[43:04] this beast is let us go to James three
[43:07] James three and I'm gonna begin starting
[43:11] at verse 6 Jane the third chapter of
[43:15] James and verse 6 down to verse 8 so I
[43:21] want you to notice here in James they
[43:25] look at this thing right here it ain't
[43:27] bit a little why are your power
[43:30] well Adam power Wars right here Adam had
[43:34] the power to speak the word what was
[43:36] Jesus power man
[43:38] should not live by bread alone but I
[43:39] have a word command above God
[43:42] so the poverty Jesus said it was at the
[43:44] power to speak the word the power Yoda
[43:47] man what man power where today what
[43:49] politics ow
[43:50] even though they do lie it's by the word
[43:54] Shakespeare and you don't you trumping
[43:57] up you're doing sign language he's
[43:59] speaking I mean here's someone saying is
[44:02] all I ain't in the politics I I don't
[44:06] think it at the back part it really
[44:07] because hey how can you probably you put
[44:10] a good man in they come out of bad man
[44:12] anyway so I hope you come on man in City
[44:14] you don't only they never gonna work for
[44:15] people's is the Baptist is another Holy
[44:17] Ghost you know who you know you're dead
[44:20] tears and everybody they got it they got
[44:22] everybody looking at everybody fighting
[44:24] there but in there and they're the
[44:25] problem i hain't taking your money and
[44:27] ain't about that to you but anyone
[44:28] taking your money but here we are
[44:30] hey it just sent way you know whatever
[44:34] but still it's like this so we won't
[44:36] look at this the very thing that we deal
[44:38] with every day and this day right heard
[44:40] that they right here it's just a little
[44:42] bitty thing it really all that bad but
[44:47] they look nothing right during a broke
[44:49] up marriages homes and broke up churches
[44:51] done broke a friendship number up I
[44:54] never injured friend you never probably
[44:56] friendship by looking at a person and
[44:59] there were shows that we here it says
[45:01] him the tongue is a fire a world of
[45:06] iniquity so is the tongue come on Zia
[45:09] members the it defiles how much of the
[45:13] body the whole body in other words if
[45:18] you don't control it it won't wash it
[45:20] right it won't wash you've done it hey
[45:22] hey just bite you got to speak to your
[45:25] body how do you got to speak to your
[45:27] body you got to tell your body this is
[45:29] what I'm gonna do cuz there's a war
[45:31] going on all the time so in other words
[45:33] in that's really it goes it says it
[45:35] defies the whole body and it is set on
[45:37] fire it's set it is set on fire the
[45:41] court course of nature it is set on fire
[45:43] from work
[45:47] this little teeny-weeny thing right here
[45:51] then cause a lot of problems and they
[45:54] don't still cause problems and it was so
[45:57] and then he said for every kind of
[46:00] beasts and birds and of the serpent and
[46:03] things that's in the sea is Tay and then
[46:06] has been tainted mankind but your tongue
[46:11] it says what can no man I mean what you
[46:17] is no me cannot tame this fellow right
[46:21] here so that means is not a job that man
[46:24] can do it take the Holy Ghost that's why
[46:27] you get my hair the whole ego or you
[46:29] would never be able to make this tongue
[46:32] come subjection to the Word of God an it
[46:35] would never want to speak it it would
[46:37] never want to use it Holly but if you
[46:39] ever get the Baptists not only go your
[46:42] tongue will obey the word historian said
[46:45] no man contain the time it is a unruly
[46:48] and full of deadly poison how your
[46:51] tongue and tennis portray and then and
[46:54] then the word in other words the Bibles
[46:56] are wild because they up but the power
[46:59] of life and death he says we really
[47:05] church for my church here to give God
[47:06] praise a miniature I could be churchy to
[47:10] worship God to make my tongue say
[47:12] hallelujah make my tongues I'll I Love
[47:15] You Lord make my tongue praise God
[47:17] made my tongue except a word I'm healed
[47:19] God I live here in the way he gave us
[47:22] his word that we must speak the word and
[47:24] tell our body this is what I'm going to
[47:26] do now you said brother what this thanks
[47:29] I'm from Delaware is a Adele Webber
[47:32] we brought there will bless we got even
[47:36] the father and where will curse we we
[47:41] miss which are may after the love of God
[47:48] so none so we we live in here and we
[47:50] looking at these words and we look at
[47:52] here it's cursing life and death is in
[47:56] the power of the tongue so now you say
[47:59] brother do what do their tongue
[48:01] said we do this thing come from wood the
[48:03] headquarters that control this name
[48:05] now I'm gonna deal with headquarters and
[48:08] then let's deal with the headquarters
[48:10] what is staying coming from what we
[48:11] speaking for me to go and speak from
[48:13] faith are we gonna speak from death
[48:15] okay so we've had him Paul goes in
[48:18] second corinthians verse i i've second
[48:21] corinthians chapter 10 verse four he
[48:23] says paul speaking here what we dealing
[48:26] with what we speak from what we get out
[48:30] work what we get our inspiration from
[48:31] happens at st. corinthians 10 chapter
[48:35] starting at verse four and five
[48:36] paul dealing with the same right here
[48:39] and he says paul saying these words take
[48:43] a trip to ten first denis go to verse
[48:46] four he says for for the weapons of our
[48:49] warfare are not carnal but mighty
[48:52] through god to pull it down us i'm
[48:57] unbundle something here
[49:00] Tim Paul says casting down imaginations
[49:04] funny because we can make people sir get
[49:09] imagine that regard in their mind
[49:11] imagine every idea in their mind well
[49:14] you you
[49:15] why do you come to Ike lose you she
[49:17] don't like me or he don't like me at the
[49:19] church its start from that plane then
[49:21] and the tongue go tell somebody else
[49:24] the stance on speaking them thing that's
[49:26] coming from this program right from an
[49:28] imagination which is no reality to it
[49:32] it's something you command it you could
[49:34] go by yourself you just get on the
[49:35] island by yourself
[49:36] highly inappropriate Allen and all of a
[49:38] sudden your imagination seola yeah you
[49:42] thought about that you can get the
[49:43] perfect place and you still got to deal
[49:45] with this you can be there by yourself
[49:48] and nobody that you're not nothing
[49:49] nothing to tip you at all and all of a
[49:51] sudden just thought coming so what did
[49:52] that come from
[49:53] how they come from that realm now how do
[49:55] you don't really come from that room
[49:56] right there it is a you cast down
[49:59] imaginations every high thing that is
[50:01] all this up against the knowledge of God
[50:02] and bringing into captivity every
[50:04] thought to the obedience of Christ
[50:07] how do you so we begin to live here
[50:09] we realize here that we've fired him
[50:11] that we got a beast that we gotta deal
[50:13] with now use that brother Joe why didn't
[50:16] you preach all that I preach don't let
[50:18] to say this without the Holy Ghost you
[50:20] can't do it honey is not it without the
[50:23] Holy Ghost you cannot do it now you say
[50:25] brother Joe what would Jesus Christ
[50:26] comfort Jesus Christ come to express the
[50:30] mystery of God revealed Jesus was
[50:34] manifested to live the holy go-behind
[50:37] skin he was he came to the earth not
[50:43] just a short he copped it up to show you
[50:45] what man can do with the Holy Ghost
[50:48] but you think either human lives
[50:51] manifested just to be manifested Holly
[50:53] didn't come as a spirit he dropped his
[50:55] eternal glory he kept not even eternal
[50:59] throne and come down to earth
[51:00] little Lord and he he stepped out on
[51:04] earth
[51:04] so I'm gonna show you what the man can
[51:06] do what the Holy Ghost he wanted to
[51:11] reveal Christ behind skiing man hasn't
[51:15] power about death he said I want to show
[51:18] them they can live it sorry what was he
[51:19] doing that why he had to speak prophecy
[51:21] in Genesis if you notice in Jesus he had
[51:24] just three prophecy because he had to
[51:26] come and fulfill he said now I'm gonna
[51:29] speak prophecy the woman see shall
[51:32] bruise the head of the serpent spoken
[51:35] words the woman's sea shall bruise the
[51:38] head of the serpent so that was a
[51:40] prophecy for because the woman ain't
[51:42] gonna see but she had to have a seat so
[51:47] we are okay so here to start working on
[51:50] this prophecy he said the woman see she
[51:52] bruised the head of the service did he
[51:54] turns around and says I'm gonna curse
[51:56] the earth so what would he do he was

[52:27] prophecy and make it come to pass
[52:30] what did he knew he turns around and he
[52:32] said either the woman sees a bruise the
[52:34] head of the sir sir-sir ridden and all
[52:37] of a sudden he bring it probably the
[52:39] path Abraham brought a type of it how
[52:43] they received a body change I did with
[52:46] you all have a baby and several to
[52:49] leverage our but then all of a sudden
[52:51] anybody was chained by young but you
[52:54] said that was the made promises no that
[52:56] was not the main prophecy that will just
[52:58] show you God change our bodies but how
[53:00] do God come down to manifest himself in
[53:02] human skin I'll lose stepped into a
[53:05] stepped into a body quote nine and three
[53:08] means did reveal Christ to Abraham I'll
[53:11] do it anyway sandwich and drunk the
[53:15] glass umbrella and then turn back to

[59:58] get some breakfast
[59:59] and I thought uncle I thought I was
[1:00:02] gonna pull over Popeye and get some
[1:00:03] chickens but here we are so we we go
[1:00:07] through this all damn attitude from but
[1:00:11] Jesus is that what Jesus was Jesus
[1:00:13] himself he goes right into his Satan
[1:00:16] goes right into his mind
[1:00:17] and begin to deal with his and he done
[1:00:20] fasted 40 days and 40 nights his stomach
[1:00:23] is growling like you're he thinking
[1:00:25] about boo and saying say
[1:00:27] if you be the Son of God turn these
[1:00:32] stones into bread and they're worse
[1:00:36] use your mighty power but Jesus won't
[1:00:40] lay Express he was not come to use that
[1:00:43] in that room he come to use the
[1:00:46] authority that Adams had the authority
[1:00:49] of the word that makes Satan obey the
[1:00:52] word anyways what did Jesus say Jesus
[1:00:55] say Satan don't you even mention not
[1:00:59] live by bread alone but by every word
[1:01:03] that was sitting at him I forgot so what
[1:01:05] was he doing here we read thorn he
[1:01:07] restored the authority of his lost year
[1:01:10] how do I take my word and I made Satan
[1:01:14] get off setting bad that didn't say
[1:01:16] Cassius I don't you tip the LORD thy God
[1:01:18] Satan so he taking the words of
[1:01:21] authority he's not doing no power he's
[1:01:23] not he's not turning her nothing he not
[1:01:25] create he's speaking the word sayings
[1:01:28] that I give you the keynote no no Seder
[1:01:30] Thalia I I'm not the second person in
[1:01:33] the Godhead I hit him to God so he
[1:01:37] reboots Satan who never grows surely
[1:01:39] sader that I have no word and I want you
[1:01:43] to notice this you say that was Jesus
[1:01:46] greatest battle that was not Jesus
[1:01:50] greatest battle that was a battle
[1:01:53] but Jesus greatest battle was he must
[1:01:58] restore the power of his Dominion ship
[1:02:02] battle power to control his own tongue
[1:02:06] did power to show the authority so you
[1:02:09] said what was his great as the battle
[1:02:11] Cheetahs greatest battle was gas cemani
[1:02:15] Jesus greatest battle was gas cemani a
[1:02:18] desert stone he whooped the devil real
[1:02:20] quick but this time is dealing between
[1:02:23] his flesh his mental condition and
[1:02:26] everything and Jesus himself to flush
[1:02:30] the main part of Jesus did not want had
[1:02:33] to bear this
[1:02:35] what you think you'd ask God to see if
[1:02:37] it be possible let this cup pass for the
[1:02:42] workers but not the body of a man we're
[1:02:45] speaking Calibra lie with deaf ears he
[1:02:48] will I were paying us and he speaking
[1:02:51] her Oh God
[1:02:53] he wants to look a father this say did
[1:02:55] is happen one time he said to say two or
[1:02:58] three times he did fellow did phases a
[1:03:00] God if it be possible let this cup pass
[1:03:04] from me that body did not want to go
[1:03:09] through this because he knew what it was
[1:03:11] but he had the order for him to be take
[1:03:16] this Dominion to Adam lost the power to
[1:03:19] control astern he gotta give it all to
[1:03:22] God early at the end of the day he
[1:03:25] submitted himself and it in submission
[1:03:29] to his self he said father not as I will
[1:03:34] but as thou willest
[1:03:36] he made his body obeyed his confession
[1:03:40] only made his body when he left gets it
[1:03:44] but he did not down a crawl he died in
[1:03:46] Gethsemane he died he Gethsemane well it
[1:03:50] was he said his word he was surrendered
[1:03:53] it was over which my body is going to
[1:03:57] die
[1:03:58] my body's gonna pay the price oh my God
[1:04:01] my God why divert second me hallelujah
[1:04:04] it were his body as a man God left him
[1:04:08] against him he left him on the cross he
[1:04:10] died as a man he died as a sin offering
[1:04:13] how did God separate himself from that
[1:04:16] scene Hollywood straight to hell for you
[1:04:19] and me honey but that same power that
[1:04:22] same God came back I near nor the Holy
[1:04:25] Spirit quicker than earth again the back
[1:04:28] to love God the other was standing in
[1:04:31] the garden again
[1:04:32] in a glorified body
[1:04:38] but let me just no say this here that
[1:04:41] could be all day
[1:04:42] would you think about this how did Jesus
[1:04:46] did all this
[1:04:47] he said God not as I will now will it
[1:04:53] then we go here they cares him to pallet
[1:04:56] Hall and all the things to be judged and
[1:05:00] I want you to notice this you ever
[1:05:03] thought about this he was being judged
[1:05:05] and he'll go to the law was that when
[1:05:11] pallet judged him he says let me say
[1:05:14] something to you Jesus
[1:05:15] do you realize I have power to release
[1:05:22] you academia and what he was saying to
[1:05:26] Jesus Jesus looking at him says you
[1:05:30] ain't got no power
[1:05:33] he was the IDI claiming in dominion ship
[1:05:37] over the word oh yeah but Jesus saying
[1:05:40] nobody you have no power power it will
[1:05:46] you would either have nothing if I
[1:05:47] didn't give it to you you think you
[1:05:49] somebody great you ain't got no power
[1:05:52] without the Holy Spirit
[1:05:54] Allu you know whenever so he said they
[1:05:56] is up it was Satan telling that same you
[1:05:59] them pilot they tell him I got power
[1:06:01] over you
[1:06:01] Jesus said no you don't you are the mind
[1:06:04] abandon ship I'm not into yours I'm
[1:06:07] gonna control the situation right here
[1:06:10] you thought about that Jesus was in
[1:06:13] control of the situation
[1:06:15] compile it was real if he knows her so
[1:06:20] what was the law they had in law was did
[1:06:23] they were gonna have to warn them is
[1:06:25] gonna be released palette that will
[1:06:30] release Barabbas or Jesus one of them
[1:06:34] had to be released that was their own
[1:06:36] law so they had a law so they tried take
[1:06:39] up with a law here and what it was
[1:06:42] palate judges Jesus and his judgment was
[1:06:46] I find no fault in this man which should
[1:06:51] have influenced the people's to say
[1:06:53] whatever the government done that he
[1:06:56] found no far we might well to let him go
[1:06:58] but wonder why that they still did not
[1:07:03] want Jesus they said give us Barabbas
[1:07:06] higher because we remember her the world
[1:07:09] of his own that same nature that they
[1:07:12] had that same beastly nature was owned
[1:07:15] in the same way even though they were
[1:07:17] religious under it so they were to have
[1:07:19] a Myrtle didn't have a word they'd
[1:07:23] rather have a murder they'd have a man
[1:07:24] in here to see a man that raised the day
[1:07:27] a man that cast out Devils they'd rather
[1:07:30] have a murder than that but the point of
[1:07:34] it was they didn't do that Jesus chain
[1:07:38] demise because Palin did not come I mean
[1:07:43] but robbers were not born the death for
[1:07:46] the sins of the world he was not the
[1:07:49] atonement for the world if PAP Gina
[1:07:51] would have been set free
[1:07:53] how do it would have broke ever time
[1:07:57] Tony
[1:07:58] Edwin subpath Barabbas was not dead
[1:08:02] adopted Jesus Gina would never die for
[1:08:05] Barabbas did Gina was the escape goat he
[1:08:09] had to go to hell so he put it in the
[1:08:14] horse
[1:08:15] this ain't give us Barabbas I got power
[1:08:19] to control this
[1:08:20] anyway everything of your I got poverty
[1:08:24] control in Syria so he took control of
[1:08:26] the beasts he took control of the earth
[1:08:29] right near Holly needs a given parabola
[1:08:32] crucified Jesus that won't fold the
[1:08:34] happy that was a very dangerous
[1:08:37] they said the right were didn't know who
[1:08:40] the volume well it's alright
[1:08:45] God got it all in control just sometimes
[1:08:49] we don't thank me sometime we look
[1:08:51] anything or man this is bad look what's
[1:08:53] happening here but GOG I didn't control
[1:08:55] do that why Paul could say everything
[1:08:57] work together for the good to dim to
[1:08:59] love God a collar cord their purpose how
[1:09:01] did God got in control if we could only
[1:09:03] acknowledge that sometimes we go through
[1:09:04] trials and tribulation we think Oh God
[1:09:06] why me
[1:09:07] but God got in control he knew what you
[1:09:09] were doing this services right here how
[1:09:11] can you be overcome and you never become
[1:09:13] none so he did they say give us so Jesus
[1:09:20] had to be that he had to be that
[1:09:22] sacrifice and he never now much it knows
[1:09:28] Jesus only could claim so much of his
[1:09:34] dominion ship but is he never claimed
[1:09:38] all his Dominion ship to after he had
[1:09:41] conquered death gray hail and
[1:09:44] resurrected you think about that he
[1:09:46] never de claim all the Dominion shifty
[1:09:48] them went to all third those those days
[1:09:49] and once he went through those stages
[1:09:51] right there how you say Brett Julia cuz
[1:09:54] he never claimed this board in the
[1:09:55] scripture so out he conquered death
[1:09:57] graven hail he rose up and he come out
[1:10:00] of the gray and then once you come out
[1:10:02] of the gray he steps up he said oh he
[1:10:06] then took the minute i abducted me in
[1:10:09] order I attend dominion over the heavens
[1:10:11] all power is given unto me and heaven in
[1:10:14] her
[1:10:15] ever names that call gonna call on me
[1:10:17] now I do this narrator I have paid the
[1:10:20] price of redemption and I have paid your
[1:10:23] price
[1:10:23] hey will you breathe the name of Jesus
[1:10:25] Christ ever Devon Hale gotta buy now all
[1:10:28] power is given unto me what you can do
[1:10:32] if you ever get the baptism in the Holy
[1:10:34] Spirit I leave that out there devil
[1:10:37] Oh God you said brother Drew that was
[1:10:39] Jesus no that was Jesus had it now you
[1:10:42] got it
[1:10:43] and now you don't have to be Robin it's
[1:10:46] not robbery to come to the same level
[1:10:48] favorite Jesus had how do you say
[1:10:50] brother Joe would he have a vagina
[1:10:52] David the same level how did Jesus seen
[1:10:55] you before man even had the whole ego he
[1:10:57] met a certain soldier he had the same
[1:11:01] things that he had me the man had the
[1:11:05] same faith in Jesus area he said another
[1:11:08] man I'm a man of authority out of all
[1:11:13] the people that Jesus met in that day he
[1:11:16] was a jet how a man with the same level
[1:11:20] of faith that Jesus had explaining to
[1:11:23] Jesus I understand the law of faith he
[1:11:27] says I understand what authority is I
[1:11:31] understand what Dominion CBS so he
[1:11:34] explained into Jesus the revelation that
[1:11:38] he had in and he says I say to this man
[1:11:41] come he come I say to just men go he
[1:11:44] says no use for you to go to my house
[1:11:46] I'm not even that but I know if you say
[1:11:48] the word I know the power behind the
[1:11:51] word so he understood the power of
[1:11:54] authority and we speak the name of Jesus
