[3:55] Jonah 2 verse 9 but I will sacrifice
[4:04] unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving
[4:06] I will pay that that I have vowed
[4:11] salvation is of the Lord and the Lord
[4:14] spake unto the fish and it vomited out
[4:17] Jonah upon the dry ground all right
[4:20] let's go to John to Romans 2 I wish you
[4:23] would read the entire chapter we won't
[4:27] this read with just part of it but read
[4:29] the entire second chapter especially and
[4:33] watch what we when we get into the
[4:35] message of what I'm talking about and
[4:38] you'll see that we very valuable to
[4:40] follow in that line let's just go to
[4:43] verse 10 and then we'll pick up about
[4:46] five verses and go from there but glory
[4:49] honor and peace to every man that work
[4:52] is good to the Jew first and also to the
[4:55] Gentile so that's everybody
[4:57] okay everybody for there is no respect
[5:02] of persons with God for as many as I've
[5:05] sinned without law shall also perish
[5:08] without law and as many as have sinned
[5:11] in the law shall be judged by the law
[5:14] for not the hearers of the law are just
[5:17] before God but the doers of the law
[5:19] shall be justified for when the Gentiles
[5:23] which have not the law do by nature the
[5:26] things contained in the law these having
[5:29] not the law once are law unto themselves
[5:34] which show the work of the law written
[5:37] in their hearts their conscience also
[5:40] bearing witness
[5:42] and their thoughts the mean while
[5:46] accusing or else excusing one another he
[5:51] goes on to talk about in the day other
[5:52] judgments in the thing you may be seated
[5:54] the Lord had his blessing to the reading
[5:56] of the word now I want to try to finish
[5:59] the part that we're talking about
[6:03] salvation I'm not finishing the
[6:06] salvation where I'm from about the basis
[6:08] of what we've trying to to think about
[6:12] things and then try to move in to some
[6:15] thoughts that would be and now we will
[6:19] continue on because really what we'll do
[6:21] in a lot of respects we'll pick up a lot
[6:24] of types and shadows you know from the
[6:28] Old Testament to see about the New
[6:31] Testament remember the one thing that
[6:33] we've been talking about now remember
[6:36] salvation can't be one way in the Old
[6:38] Testament and another way in the new the
[6:42] Old Testament was by faith and grace and
[6:46] thing the new testament of the same
[6:47] thing the only difference is one of them
[6:51] is the promise now keep emphasizing that
[6:54] the Old Testament all you see in the old
[6:56] doesn't is a promise
[6:58] looking forward going forward going
[7:01] forward all right the New Testament
[7:03] settled into the product that the Old
[7:07] Testament was promising all right now so
[7:11] write that down and think on it see that
[7:14] what we're going to be doing is thinking
[7:16] of how the Old Testament will bring that
[7:19] promise into light that you can see it
[7:22] but it's not a full reality to be a
[7:27] finished product all right and that's
[7:30] why that it had to be the way it would
[7:32] be then Jesus Christ would have to come
[7:34] and die to bring the product in the view
[7:37] of the New Testament of salvation but
[7:40] remember whether it's old our new you
[7:43] can't make your salvation in one place
[7:46] one thing something they could do or
[7:48] didn't do or whatever it is and then
[7:50] make it over here some kind of a grace
[7:52] and make it unconditional
[7:55] because that's what we're going to
[7:57] strike home when we finally get to it
[7:59] about an unconditional covenant all
[8:02] right now what's this is the thought
[8:05] what do you think of as an unconditional
[8:08] covenant well it's the covenant with no
[8:11] conditions that's man's mentality is
[8:18] we'll get to a word in a minute or
[8:20] brother profit is bringing compassion in
[8:24] what he's describing in his being he
[8:27] brings one side of it as the world and
[8:29] the thoughts he brings the other side of
[8:32] it as what God thinks of alright so then
[8:35] that's the way we're gonna have to do
[8:36] with the unconditional covenant you mean
[8:39] you can go out live like the devil and
[8:41] Beyond under under an unconditional
[8:44] covenant there's more conditions to the
[8:46] to an unconditional covenant that sounds
[8:50] crazy don't there's more conditions to
[8:53] be met under the New Testament then all
[8:58] the Old Testament put together you know
[9:01] and realize that basically you live a
[9:03] decent life according to the law right I
[9:09] mean you're talking is with all of us
[9:11] see because you don't do this you do
[9:13] that you know you don't yeah we don't
[9:15] still when allowing us heat we don't
[9:17] then you say oh no you don't understand
[9:22] unconditional that's what you don't
[9:25] understand
[9:27] you're banking it one way God's making
[9:30] it another way
[9:31] you ain't whether you can live like the
[9:33] devil and get by with it yeah no way
[9:38] okay we'll get to that eventually all
[9:40] right now remember what we've been
[9:43] talking about salvation the word
[9:48] deliverance the salvation to the Old
[9:53] Testament and what it would be based
[9:56] upon is the Word of God right the Bible
[10:00] all right the Word of God in other words
[10:04] if you don't follow that line up you're
[10:08] not according to
[10:09] taking of the word alright then we
[10:12] talked about it being based upon the
[10:14] blood remember then all the Old
[10:18] Testament no further of the blood would
[10:21] be in the New Testament under the
[10:24] reality of Jesus Christ that was once
[10:27] offered all right now we see salvation
[10:31] was and will always be based upon the
[10:37] same thing you can't change it then
[10:41] we're gonna get down to something maybe
[10:43] the Lord will in the life of the message
[10:44] if we have time we will get down to
[10:48] something the real touchy and I'll tell
[10:52] you that what I've been doing and you
[10:55] can believe this or not it's alright
[10:57] with me
[10:58] I've been studying on this thought for
[11:02] over 40 years I've tried to preach it
[11:07] I've tried to express it I tried to
[11:10] bring it out into wording and I wonder
[11:15] has it accomplished I see 40 years
[11:20] thinking on something studying on
[11:23] something pondering on a thought you
[11:29] ought to know then if it's been that
[11:30] much and I admit it
[11:31] then you were to know for certain that I
[11:33] didn't have the answer what if I had if
[11:36] I'd had the answer I wouldn't been
[11:38] studied only 40 years I'm not a been
[11:41] studied on how but it turns out to be
[11:42] but I certainly wouldn't have been
[11:44] thinking on it all right now so the Lord
[11:47] is clearly opening up the word to
[11:52] express it and I knew this when I was
[11:56] told you that I would speak on salvation
[12:00] No I knew that and I knew we'd have to
[12:03] come to this so if we get a little
[12:05] lengthy tonight forgive me I'll try not
[12:06] to but I'll just do the best that I can
[12:10] do you know the only difference in the
[12:14] Old Testament and the New Testament the
[12:18] Old Testament was a promise right what
[12:23] else could you use wording there and the
[12:26] other one is the product of that now
[12:30] salvation in the Old Testament was a
[12:33] deliverance right okay it brought in the
[12:41] tone that came because of that to apply
[12:45] to the individual all right so then what
[12:49] would be the difference in the older in
[12:50] the New Testament in that basis see it
[12:55] would bring it to show you that we're
[12:57] missing what they had where do you think
[13:00] those people are today that has died and
[13:04] went on you don't never think what I
[13:10] think about what it really hurts me you
[13:13] know what brother Adam said one day he
[13:15] said you and I will be held responsible
[13:19] for not carrying the gospel to the
[13:23] heathen I'm not just not that that's why
[13:30] we send as much money as we can we do
[13:33] the best we can to try to help to do a
[13:36] lot of things all right now so now the
[13:39] difference would only be in the basics
[13:42] of what you have the Old Testament it
[13:47] was so wonderful what it had now
[13:49] remember the point that I brought out
[13:52] the Old Testament salvation was the
[13:56] deliverance to mankind whether it being
[14:00] used for the children of Israel coming
[14:01] out or whether it being used for
[14:03] salvation of the soul of an individual
[14:06] or the life of an individual all right
[14:10] and in that then we can look back and
[14:16] see it and it's the perfect example of
[14:19] where we are see that's why people don't
[14:24] understand brother Branham you don't
[14:26] listen what he say it and inconsiderate
[14:28] you know that red around said the ten
[14:30] commandments was the seals well feels
[14:39] over here or what it is he said before
[14:44] the commandments came to seals come down
[14:48] he said the Old Testament the seals I
[14:52] mean the commandments was God in letter
[14:59] form well we make it's a book of rules
[15:09] now follow that talent as we go along we
[15:13] know salvation is based upon God's Word
[15:16] and what is said it's based upon the
[15:19] blood that would speak back dire and the
[15:21] blood would be offered and transmitted
[15:24] everything forward to what it would come
[15:26] to the blood of Jesus Christ that would
[15:30] pay the price for the old and the new
[15:32] and bringing it into reality
[15:34] all right now we know that it was based
[15:38] upon the blood they were shed back down
[15:43] he took blood Fernet own it would have
[15:47] to be blood over here
[15:48] the only difference you and how the
[15:51] blood of an animal the blood of Almighty
[15:54] God when it's the promise the other one
[15:59] is the product so write that down
[16:02] promise
[16:03] Oh Jasmine product new because he they
[16:06] had a promise they remember also what we
[16:10] talked about that salvation must produce
[16:18] you a place to go to when you die is
[16:26] that not the purpose of salvation I mean
[16:29] is it not a purpose in the fact of
[16:31] thinking of salvation that there has to
[16:33] be some form of happy hunting ground or
[16:36] you know or whatever so then it's based
[16:43] upon that point and we know for a
[16:45] certain that the soul of that individual
[16:50] in the Old Testament by his faith in
[16:54] believing God provided him a place to
[17:00] work when he passed away there his soul
[17:03] would go we know in the New Testament by
[17:07] faith in Almighty God and in the
[17:10] atonement in the things in the blood of
[17:11] Jesus Christ that our faith by believing
[17:17] brings forth the product and places a
[17:21] person into a place that the Prophet
[17:24] went there and saw souls under the altar
[17:27] and how beautiful it was it truly
[17:32] provided a place but the old testament
[17:35] provided it okay now you maybe get
[17:40] surprised at a while when we get down
[17:43] into this Old Testament all right now
[17:47] I'm going to make the statement and then
[17:48] it'll take me a while maybe Sunday or a
[17:52] munde another week or two or a month or
[17:54] two to get to the main point but you
[17:56] know salvation is based not upon a God
[18:01] of sympathy now you're gonna listen
[18:05] you're gonna hold on a minute with me so
[18:07] listen now salvation is not based upon a
[18:11] god of sympathy cuz of it words why
[18:15] didn't he save everybody come on why
[18:23] didn't he say their play well see when
[18:26] he went in if they believe now that in a
[18:28] year you see you're jumping around on me
[18:30] stay with me and listen
[18:34] LeBron said there's a lot of difference
[18:37] between compassion and sympathy the
[18:43] title of the message tonight is number
[18:46] four on salvation but it's called a
[18:48] compassionate God we read in the
[18:53] scripture there about the compassion
[18:58] then we know for a certainty before we
[19:01] get dark I'll give you these thoughts
[19:02] then we'll back up sympathy is to you
[19:07] know to put up with something or you
[19:09] know think about somebody or something
[19:11] you know and and different things happen
[19:14] under sympathy but compassion now
[19:19] compassion is interchangeable so go look
[19:21] it up and all but we got to listen to
[19:23] the Prophet now we get what he says I
[19:27] don't care what Webster has to say about
[19:29] it because the word compassion is the
[19:33] same word of sympathy even in the
[19:36] Strong's Concordance as a matter of fact
[19:39] the Old Testament form of compassion is
[19:42] a better word than the New Testament
[19:44] form because in the New Testament form
[19:46] is just like compassion is like we know
[19:49] I'm sorry for them and I'll go down now
[19:52] brother Adam said he said God didn't say
[19:56] you know my brother told you he come up
[19:59] one day and said that to me he said God
[20:01] just said well and people down there
[20:04] won't listen to it so I'll they send my
[20:05] son remember he's turning to Terry said
[20:08] I'll just send my son down and he'll die
[20:10] and they'll believe it then the run said
[20:13] that ain't right
[20:15] compassion is to do the will in his will
[20:22] is this word compassion is to follow the
[20:26] world
[20:30] to follow it to the letter and walk out
[20:33] upon that very word so he's a
[20:35] compassionate God he's not a God of
[20:36] sympathy
[20:38] don't try to appease him in any way you
[20:43] don't do that with God you simply say
[20:46] I'm sorry
[20:48] don't try to appease Emer or play around
[20:51] without Lord you know me you know have a
[20:55] little compassion on me Lord he says I
[20:58] am I'm giving you the will of God for
[21:02] your life now you take the will of God
[21:07] and we can call it salvation
[21:09] you take sympathy and no salvation and
[21:13] sympathy yeah but God is a sympathizing
[21:17] God no gods a compassionate God we'll
[21:21] get to that later in the talk all right
[21:23] so now it's based upon whether God is a
[21:26] compassionate God or he is a God of
[21:28] sympathy all right now here was where we
[21:33] ended up on the message you know a
[21:37] couple of weeks ago nice winds here when
[21:40] it was couple weeks ago we were talking
[21:44] about grace being the oldest religion
[21:49] that there is and how it came to Pais
[21:53] and I brought forth the things and how
[21:58] that grace was before the sin yeah no
[22:08] brother that sets up here his brother
[22:09] was with us other day in here he come
[22:13] out and he said Joe I thought well I
[22:16] wonder how many yet in the church we
[22:17] listen to that he said sir he said I
[22:20] enjoyed your message as well thank you
[22:23] he said you know I never thought of the
[22:27] fact that the Savior came before the sin
[22:36] they say he got that out of the message
[22:38] that I tried to preach that the Savior
[22:41] came first and then the sin came later
[22:46] did you catch that did you understand it
[22:49] that way then you wouldn't follow them
[22:53] if you don't because what happened in
[22:55] the garden seen it in the picture God
[23:01] stepped out of heaven cleaned down to
[23:04] earth and made the atonement for their
[23:09] sins so that they could be counted as
[23:12] being saved by grace through faith that
[23:16] he had already done that in his mine
[23:19] before the world ever begun is it right
[23:23] he had already paid the price so grace
[23:28] supplied the atonement it wouldn't have
[23:31] told me coming in in grace coming no
[23:34] grace came first then it supplied the
[23:39] atonement that way that would make God
[23:42] in the right order okay so then we were
[23:46] saved by grace through faith and don't
[23:49] matter where there's Old Testament or
[23:51] new you're saved by grace through faith
[23:56] so now that would make it right or what
[23:58] we were trying to bring out the one of
[24:02] the conditions of salvation would it be
[24:05] old or new it's whether or not you can
[24:09] believe that is for you come on and you
[24:20] never thought about why did it says it
[24:22] abraham believed god and what does it
[24:26] say and it was imputed or counted or
[24:29] reckoned unto him in salvation right so
[24:39] then salvation is based solely upon
[24:41] faith
[24:45] your faith that you can believe that
[24:48] it's for you now it doesn't matter where
[24:51] it's older new yeah but it's fun all
[24:58] right we'll get that in a minute let me
[25:00] ask you a question before we get to that
[25:01] thought and you never wondered why God
[25:04] put Adam and Eve on a conditional
[25:06] covenant I didn't say that you read your
[25:17] prophets message your tile yorda studied
[25:20] it enough to know he said it why would
[25:28] they put on the conditional covenant
[25:33] those are drastic immoral I mean a
[25:36] wonderful purpose we'll get to it in a
[25:38] minute to listen the atonement is what
[25:47] keeps you saved now you listening the
[25:53] atonement older noona is what keeps you
[25:57] saved
[25:59] why did Brett around say he says your
[26:03] kept saved by what by the blood had all
[26:12] this and that all that Gudrun said
[26:17] you're kept saved he said you're not
[26:18] saved by the blood he said you were
[26:20] saved by grace through faith but he said
[26:23] you're cut saved by the blood I'm saved
[26:28] I thought it's unconditional I thought
[26:34] it was an unconditional that's when we
[26:40] get in their mind at all
[26:42] we don't realize it it comes down from
[26:45] organized religions right on down into
[26:47] the message and then we settled in to
[26:49] that point and it don't matter what it's
[26:52] saying I believe it this way okay that's
[26:58] with me because ain't gonna change you
[27:00] know alright now what are we doing it on
[27:04] hold it right it's based upon the word
[27:07] and what it says it's based upon the
[27:10] blood would it be older new it's based
[27:13] upon faith in the blood it's based upon
[27:16] whether God is a compassionate God or a
[27:19] God of sympathy boyer does he see we
[27:29] make it say what we want it to say all
[27:36] right grace was given to Adam and Eve in
[27:40] the garden
[27:42] grace was older than their sin because
[27:46] he knew what they would do it was
[27:50] already for part all he done was stepped
[27:55] out and I tell you want I don't know how
[28:01] many of you been listening but about
[28:03] three months ago I said we're gonna get
[28:07] down to earth one of these days we
[28:09] stayed before the foundation in the
[28:10] world for about three months and I said
[28:14] one of these days we're gonna get down
[28:15] to earth well you know what we just now
[28:18] got tire you know what the other day
[28:21] when I screamed that out I said grace
[28:23] step from glory to earth brought us
[28:27] right down to earth and where we are to
[28:29] the human race grace is a person Grace
[28:37] restore took the mantle rip them apart
[28:39] and brother Brandon said don't the skins
[28:42] into behind the bushes
[28:44] they had him and even told him to put
[28:45] them on then you know what he said just
[28:49] doing notes he he said there's in the
[28:51] bushes having church that's what your
[28:56] prophet said see he still thought she's
[28:59] right all right but now get to the point
[29:06] brother branham makes an outstanding
[29:08] statement and i emphasize a little bit
[29:10] upon him he says in the message of
[29:17] message of grace 61 the grace was shown
[29:22] first it's also in the message paragraph
[29:27] 82/63 he calls what happened in Genesis
[29:34] the Word of God he calls it the law you
[29:38] remember that last week we're going last
[29:41] they were in a priestly you remember me
[29:43] talking about that did it he says it's
[29:46] the law well see we think Ten
[29:48] Commandments is the law Ten Commandments
[29:51] was added 3,000 years almost later from
[29:54] the beginning in Genesis he's not
[29:57] talking about the Ten Commandments back
[29:59] there that's what I tried to emphasize
[30:01] to get you to see what was the 10 what
[30:03] was the Commandments to Adam and Eve
[30:06] don't steal don't drank don't cheat
[30:09] don't run around with women don't smoke
[30:11] don't do well they've never done any of
[30:19] that what was the law that he's talking
[30:25] about the loss on that is the Word of
[30:27] God the Word of God told Adam and Eve do
[30:31] not pur take of that tree of knowledge
[30:37] that was all they had to do or not do
[30:42] you hear brethren say Adam and Eve had
[30:45] one word and couldn't keep it so we got
[30:48] the whole Bible see they never had a
[30:55] book of rules that's why when you get to
[30:57] it the laws not a book Ruth it's a
[31:03] revelation of Jesus Christ you know my
[31:08] love I've heard it as rules and
[31:10] regulations that's what you've heard all
[31:11] your life does that make it right
[31:17] see then that was a life point we were
[31:20] talking about little random called
[31:24] what he gave to them in the garden the
[31:28] law which was his word that said do not
[31:33] partake of that tree of knowledge that
[31:38] was the only thing they had to do or
[31:41] don't do right
[31:45] he didn't sit down and tell us that now
[31:47] no you don't steal you don't cheat you
[31:49] don't lie you don't do you know I said
[31:52] just don't protect well when you come to
[31:57] the natural law you were to realize if
[31:58] God gave that back there started to
[32:00] doubt away where did he come into the
[32:01] Ten Commandments we see that's where
[32:04] people don't believe it that way
[32:06] they take the Ten Commandments is law
[32:08] you ain't never been in a Baptist Church
[32:11] they never heard people in the Baptist
[32:14] Church were in your church where you
[32:15] come from
[32:15] we ain't under law weeds under grace
[32:20] Jesus Christ was was under grace did he
[32:25] done away with that law my Bible said he
[32:27] magnified the law my Bible said he made
[32:30] it honorable it said that he enhanced it
[32:32] in other words that's what the Bible
[32:36] says I knew then scriptures when I was
[32:38] in a bad this church then I didn't agree
[32:42] with that salt the Ewing the Word of God
[32:49] is just a a book of rules I thought this
[32:54] entire Bible was a revelation in Jesus
[32:56] Christ and my quoting brother Branham he
[33:00] said if you can't see what Christ in
[33:02] every verse you should go back to read
[33:03] again he's because he missed it
[33:05] thou shalt not kill I like the way
[33:08] brother Gary Atkins was about it he said
[33:12] the way we take it is you know God looks
[33:13] over he said thou shalt not kill I feel
[33:18] not still I shall not lie
[33:21] Ameen God you know
[33:25] and he said but why don't we read it the
[33:28] way God said God said that's your lunch
[33:32] deal a compassionate God says thou shalt
[33:39] not steal thou shalt not kill it changes
[33:45] the whole story you've heard the man
[33:46] that his wife kept writing him a letter
[33:48] sent earn it and he got this other guy
[33:50] to read the letter every guy was reading
[33:52] that letter to him and read it with you
[33:54] I said here she made reminding he's
[33:56] penned it to her he said well when she
[33:58] changed her mind off yes straight well
[34:00] he got another guy to read it yeah
[34:01] got rid of said honey I need some money
[34:04] could you see he said she changed her
[34:06] mind I'll send it to her now that's
[34:09] about the way we are in the Word of God
[34:11] only a whole lot worse all right grace
[34:17] came to earth to take the skins off did
[34:25] he already had him covered never asked
[34:27] the question I said what kept Adam and
[34:30] Eve from being killed from the time they
[34:32] sinned
[34:32] until God made the atonement when one
[34:36] second of rent in the presence of God he
[34:39] would have killed Adam and Eve Grace had
[34:42] already made way cause grace before the
[34:46] world the morning stars sang together
[34:49] sons of God shouted for Jonah yeah that
[34:52] was in God's mind
[34:53] now we're getting from God's mind into a
[34:55] reality that we step to earth and in the
[34:58] Garden of Eden and God they understand
[35:01] what they're doing you know what brother
[35:08] Adam said the tree of life was in the
[35:09] garden to remind Adam and Eve that her
[35:12] youth was being renewed you know what
[35:14] he's talking about you know their flesh
[35:16] was what was needed to being renewed not
[35:19] her soul because it was eternal
[35:21] according to blaspheme it's nothing now
[35:24] I didn't write the book grounds when it
[35:25] said he breathed into his nostrils
[35:27] eternal life see we don't believe that
[35:30] especially saying in to eat I don't
[35:32] believe in hat now I believe it could be
[35:34] maybe for Adam but I don't think it
[35:36] could be for Eve
[35:38] see why not she was part of him
[35:42] we're not brought around when brother
[35:44] Brennan said they were in theophany
[35:46] together as one but we don't believe it
[35:54] but now listen all they had to do was
[35:59] not protect of the Tree of Life I mean
[36:03] it's really knowledge that's all I had
[36:06] to do you know what that eternal life in
[36:09] their soul their spirit wasn't eternal
[36:12] but there was nothing out of you know
[36:14] Satan had not got into that road he
[36:16] began to get into it along about sin
[36:18] problem but their body is what needed
[36:21] the real atonement like that they
[36:26] started off a wonderful situation don't
[36:29] you realize that today Adam and Eve died
[36:33] know that they went to paradise which
[36:39] was the Old Testament
[36:41] moves him of Abraham it was called a
[36:45] place for the soul to go when they died
[36:50] you realize they had eternal life well
[36:54] we don't we can't fathom that and see
[36:56] you said this way present Ella I don't
[36:58] know you bring out these sign I just
[36:59] can't believe it can't believe what
[37:03] would you mind telling me what you can't
[37:06] believe about the statement that brother
[37:07] Brennan said Adam had eternal life in
[37:09] his soul
[37:11] it was his body that didn't have it and
[37:14] his spirit was the problem is there
[37:17] something wrong with expressing that
[37:22] something wrong with our head all right
[37:26] but now remember this thought as we try
[37:30] to pick up now Adam and Eve in the
[37:34] garden according to the message God's
[37:40] only provided place of worship we'll
[37:41] jump over to number 4 brothers you can
[37:44] pull that out while I'm getting to a
[37:45] point and you'll see
[37:49] that brother Branham says there was also
[37:53] two covenants given one covenant was
[37:56] given to Adam which was on condition
[37:58] like law if we will not touch this you
[38:03] know live but if you touch it you'll die
[38:06] no the other law was given or another
[38:09] then another covenant was given to
[38:11] Abraham all right that's coming away on
[38:14] over right so let's just stick with Adam
[38:17] and Eve
[38:18] Adams covenant was unconditional Adam
[38:22] and Eve's Covenant was conditional well
[38:29] why would God started off on condition
[38:42] what
[38:44] what would I start off on condition
[38:49] could you see that was the only way he
[38:51] could do it now listen for a second and
[38:58] he given Adam and Eve listen had he
[39:02] given Adam and Eve an unconditional
[39:05] covenant handed to them he could have
[39:10] never condemned them for being wrong
[39:17] they wouldn't have been wrong because it
[39:20] would unconditional because that's the
[39:21] way you're thinking of unconditional are
[39:25] you listening
[39:27] have you given Adam and Eve an
[39:30] unconditional covenant then how could he
[39:33] condemn them now let's take another word
[39:38] I've told you that the people of this
[39:39] message don't believe in it they don't
[39:41] believe in free moral agency you get out
[39:46] and find out ask questions you'll find
[39:48] out they don't believe in free moral
[39:49] agency they believe the bride is a
[39:52] special group that was brought all the
[39:54] way from glory down and placed over here
[39:57] and there's no nothing to them all the
[40:00] rest of the world is under free moral
[40:03] agency well we gave a whole message on
[40:07] free moral agency where I could say you
[40:10] ought to believe the Prophet that talked
[40:12] about free moral agency right if not go
[40:17] back a few weeks and get the title you
[40:19] hear it the only way God could bring man
[40:24] to the position that he could fall was
[40:28] to give him free moral agency do you
[40:31] agree that's exactly what he done he
[40:39] gave them a choice they could have
[40:44] stayed away from that tree
[40:49] and they would have had no trouble
[40:51] that's quoting her or starting to want
[40:54] to go Lauren said that Adams youth was
[40:57] being renewed while he was are in the
[40:59] garden by free moral agency God knowing
[41:06] if he made him with an unconditional
[41:08] covenant he could not condemn him but he
[41:17] knew he might have with condition I
[41:25] didn't say it's your prophet saying come
[41:28] on let's see what is it another one yeah
[41:31] go ahead to number five this own
[41:35] condition he had a covenant with Adam
[41:39] the first man on earth and that covenant
[41:41] was on conditions if you do so-and-so
[41:45] I'll do so-and-so Adam would have
[41:48] something to do in order to keep this
[41:51] covenant alive before God okay he had to
[42:00] walk in God's Way keeping all of his
[42:02] word not breaking the word that's what
[42:06] Adam had to do if he'd had done that
[42:10] everything would have stayed the way it
[42:12] was right because there was a condition
[42:16] out there don't touch of that tree but
[42:23] if you do you're gonna prove you're not
[42:24] believing me well why did he even go to
[42:28] that tree she was a free moral agent
[42:33] which meant she made her own choice so
[42:37] when he gave man his choice he knew what
[42:41] the choice would be right he knew he
[42:45] would fall for the devil's lie too had
[42:50] to put him on a condition
[42:56] or they wouldn't have been a fall I need
[43:02] to repeat that about 10 times maybe put
[43:06] them on an unconditional covenant the
[43:08] way we think about unconditioned as
[43:09] being no conditions how could you have
[43:11] condemned her for what you've done
[43:15] my free moral agency he gave them a
[43:20] choice that choice would be a condition
[43:24] that's exactly what's your profit and
[43:27] that's not the only two he said God put
[43:32] Adam and Eve on a conditional covenant
[43:42] no one by doing what he would do that
[43:45] they would sin but knowing he already
[43:49] had the atonement ready I put it this
[43:54] way before the Eve ever started her act
[43:57] grace was on its way right grace was on
[44:03] its way out of glory before Eve ever
[44:06] done what she done because he knew
[44:08] exactly what he was gonna go but are you
[44:13] listening I'm trying to give you
[44:14] something where you can think and you
[44:16] never considered what was the condition
[44:20] Adam was put on when your prophet is one
[44:24] it said it the Bible don't say it you
[44:28] know what I mean you can't find anybody
[44:29] what Adam would put on conditional coda
[44:31] you can't find over an Abraham we put on
[44:34] unconditional cousin cuz it's not
[44:36] written that way what are you listening
[44:42] man was given a choice the god of glory
[44:47] knowing the choice he would make now
[44:55] don't be too hard on me but y'all need
[44:58] to quit no word
[45:02] okay wait said he gets the Sunday ones
[45:05] would just think think about what I'm
[45:11] saying Adam and Eve was placed on the
[45:16] conditional covenant so they would fall
[45:21] did god megamen oh he made them with a
[45:23] free moral agency choice right
[45:27] he didn't make him do it now come on he
[45:30] gave them the choice and they done it
[45:32] and when he did he had to come to that
[45:34] and condemn it there's nothing to
[45:40] condemn under an unconditional covenant
[45:42] we'll get to that later but it's
[45:45] condemned by felt I read in the
[45:47] scripture to you that we'll be reading
[45:49] over and over for a while that I'm sure
[45:52] something that I've studied on 40 almost
[45:55] 50 years when I first heard that prophet
[45:58] and the way he began to say thank God if
[46:02] we could never understand that we could
[46:06] never understand what he say it
[46:07] it'll sure help us would listen free
[46:12] moral agency is a right to choose grace
[46:16] came before the atonement right it
[46:23] existed before the atonement but didn't
[46:25] need to be applied until the sin then
[46:31] grave provided the atonement same thing
[46:36] with Jesus cry me come on we're still a
[46:44] free moral agency no o your own free
[46:50] moral agency to accept the word and
[46:52] reject the word same thing all right
[46:58] see once sin entered the picture grace
[47:02] produced the product of the atonement
[47:05] God stepped from heaven to earth in the
[47:10] person of grace
[47:13] to take the skin from the animals and
[47:16] place it on Adam and Eve and make an
[47:22] atonement make an atonement so truly if
[47:31] we are then saved by grace see here's
[47:35] something I wrote a long time ago so you
[47:38] just think about it as we get to later
[47:41] that we will be considering the point of
[47:45] what is an unconditional covenant can we
[47:48] live like the devil and still say it's
[47:50] unconditional now write this down your
[48:02] very conscience won't allow you to do
[48:06] that come on
[48:12] but just remember be careful and got
[48:17] them here in the scripture you can sear
[48:19] your conscience yeah okay now think with
[48:28] me for a second to where we can get to
[48:30] point
[48:32] soin Adam and Eve sinned where did they
[48:35] see in you remember we went back under
[48:36] where did this in it they didn't sin in
[48:39] their soul because that soul was eternal
[48:42] bless me miss nice what their body would
[48:47] not be capable of sin because he cannot
[48:49] sin so where would the sin enter the
[48:53] picture in the garden into her five
[48:59] senses of the second rim now I say that
[49:03] because you know there's a difference in
[49:05] the way the Prophet told it here and
[49:07] told it here when it all comes out to be
[49:09] the same way so I use it the way I mean
[49:11] for it to be you
[49:12] the second rim
[49:15] which the first room is CJ's filled
[49:17] smelling here
[49:19] second room is memory reason conscience
[49:21] affections the third room is only one
[49:24] sense that's either faith or doubt all
[49:28] right so God so the devil attack Eve in
[49:32] her conscious her spirit realm now watch
[49:37] that in a minute so you better stay
[49:38] awake like a angel you're gonna need it
[49:41] see they already had eternal life in
[49:45] their soul so the only place Satan could
[49:49] attack was the second realm of mankind
[49:53] the memory reason conscious affections
[49:56] he couldn't attack nothing else he could
[50:01] not get that soul to sin he couldn't do
[50:07] that he had to go into the point to her
[50:10] there's this realm that we call and try
[50:14] to hold to it be into what the spirit
[50:16] realm of mankind goes bringing all the
[50:20] prophets is of the things we come down
[50:22] to see you have five senses or outer
[50:25] five senses per second one sense for the
[50:28] sinner and you call it spirit or soul or
[50:30] whatever you want to just remember
[50:32] you're dealing with that second dream
[50:34] all right because they could not sin in
[50:39] their soul so Satan could not work on
[50:46] Eve so now father it you remember we
[50:52] brought it out that's why Paul said he
[50:56] wasn't scared that Satan through his
[50:58] subtilty would deceive he's talking to
[51:02] the church right would deceive the
[51:07] church Oh bless God I can't be deceived
[51:11] honey you already are you need to be
[51:15] trying to get rid of it I don't like
[51:19] your attitude I don't either
[51:23] but is it the truth okay forget it
[51:28] alright where do you see in over brother
[51:32] Dale I don't see in the Bible and the
[51:35] Prophet says that only a Christian can
[51:39] sin a sinner is condemned on a higher
[51:42] level
[51:49] well I'll tell you what that's joining
[51:51] us Baptist doctor I'll agree with hear
[51:56] the word is it that you sin by
[52:00] disbelieving God's Word in the spirit
[52:02] realm our second room which is your
[52:05] memory reasonable conscience affection
[52:08] sometimes and there's work troubles
[52:11] because in that room is where we try to
[52:14] analyze everything we try to figure it
[52:17] all out
[52:18] that Center realm you ever heard the
[52:20] Prophet say he said if that Center in
[52:21] speech he said all else shut up why
[52:25] because that Center realm knows what's
[52:27] doing but Satan is trying to attack to
[52:31] us he can't attacked in our soul if
[52:33] you're born again now do you agree with
[52:37] that now let's back up now to see if you
[52:40] agree with this ball no we got to go
[52:42] here than everybody you wait after Adam
[52:47] and Eve they were the only two that had
[52:50] eternal life in their soul Old Testament
[52:55] people there's only two it had it right
[52:59] okay if that be true then Cain Abel came
[53:10] with not an eternal soul they became
[53:15] with the body spirit and soul into
[53:17] Satan's domain we don't get down in some
[53:23] little tiki-tiki things in a minute so
[53:25] listen so once it came to Cain and Abel
[53:29] even there all the way down except for
[53:31] Jesus Christ
[53:33] all mankind is born to the basis
[53:36] the body the spirit the soul or whatever
[53:39] you wanna call it first room second room
[53:41] third room is totally black and lost
[53:45] over brother Dale I believe I got this
[53:48] seat in here well now my Bible says you
[53:50] do what you want to my Bible says God
[53:54] won't dwelling unclean vessels so now
[53:56] you do what you won't do it you put all
[53:58] this seed here and see there we know
[54:00] what for profit is covered but you see
[54:02] that's were that people aren't gonna
[54:04] listen to the real truth okay now listen
[54:11] so ever man everybody since then now are
[54:15] you listening get the board's right Adam
[54:20] and Eve had a soul it was eternal a
[54:23] spirit second room that was not eternal
[54:27] and a body that were not eternal okay
[54:30] but everybody acted in had no eternal
[54:32] life in the soul so now listen to what
[54:35] I'm saying now Satan attacks every
[54:39] individual every individual in their
[54:44] soul in their spirit because he's got
[54:47] access to it now here's where we're
[54:50] gonna get it we're gonna prove a point
[54:54] after a while let's see if you can
[54:55] believe it
[54:58] Satan now and has been since that room
[55:01] and started he has the ability to enter
[55:07] ever individual I have never believed
[55:12] and never taught that the devil was born
[55:15] in you like I teach it the message you
[55:17] know I can't have the deviled over here
[55:18] no no you're born in Satan's domain well
[55:23] I can't have a devil made me do it we're
[55:26] gonna get down to some childish thinking
[55:28] after a while what is the age of
[55:29] accountability
[55:34] you know the child dies before the age
[55:37] of accountability it automatically goes
[55:40] to heaven that's what your prophet said
[55:46] so what is the age of accountability
[55:52] then what if that child does not come to
[55:55] the age of accountability in about 40
[55:57] years old or if it dies for then age of
[56:01] accountability
[56:02] age of accountability age of
[56:04] accountability is when you realize
[56:05] you're a sinner now I'm quoting brother
[56:07] Branham when you find out you're a
[56:10] sinner that's the age of accountability
[56:12] that is accountable then from then on
[56:15] it's accountable because you know you
[56:20] take a little girl little boy 2 years
[56:22] old put him in the bathtub come on we
[56:25] raise kids okay lady in India she wrote
[56:28] me a letter one time say what's her name
[56:30] Cynthia she wrote me a letter one time
[56:32] she said brother Dale I'm trying to
[56:33] raise my kids like you said you raised
[56:35] your you take a little boy and a little
[56:37] girl two year to open them in about two
[56:39] of you ain't got no problem right would
[56:42] you take a little boy in a little girl
[56:44] about five years old put them in the
[56:45] bathtub they'll start looking at each
[56:46] other about seven years old they're
[56:49] gonna start doing other things so you
[56:50] don't put them in the bathtub not kids
[56:54] are different Oh glory my kids don't sin
[56:59] you forget it don't put them in the
[57:04] bathtub together well because they find
[57:10] out what's going on
[57:12] so what is the age of accountability
[57:14] it's when you become accountable and
[57:18] realize what's going on now that'll be
[57:22] valuable in a minute now here's the
[57:29] point that I've said a total I studied
[57:31] 40 years
[57:35] in the realm that we're living in which
[57:42] is Satan's domain there's I've got
[57:43] enough do you need that from the Prophet
[57:45] we're living in Satan's domain Satan
[57:48] ain't our daddy
[57:53] Satan ain't our daddy Satan can't give
[57:56] you a soul he perverts the nature of the
[58:01] soul but he can't give you a soul God
[58:04] can only give you a soul so every baby's
[58:09] baby is born and it don't matter whether
[58:15] mama and daddy are right or wrong I
[58:17] won't be glad to show you these things
[58:21] your prophet said there's denominations
[58:24] that believe your mom and daddy was good
[58:25] the baby goes to heaven if it dies you
[58:27] know little but said if they're wrong
[58:29] they'll go to hell he said I differ with
[58:32] that that's wrong he could called the
[58:34] blood of Jesus Christ atones for that
[58:37] child until it reaches the age of
[58:40] accountability you think about them
[58:44] little babies then when they die under
[58:47] the age of accountability they're going
[58:50] to heaven there's a compassion in God
[58:58] there's not a God of sympathy he's not
[59:03] sympathizing with the little kids he's a
[59:07] compassionate God he's doing what he
[59:10] said in the garden he's doing what he
[59:13] brought all the way through the Old
[59:14] Testament what salvation is based on
[59:16] whether or not you can believe salvation
[59:21] is based on whether or not you can
[59:23] believe and what does the Bible say
[59:28] about believing must believe that God is
[59:33] not he was or somewheres else
[59:36] these are Garda present tense
[59:42] trying to finish up our thoughts on the
[59:45] Old Testament ain't said I said I'm not
[59:47] finishing it now because we're taking
[59:49] the tops and the shadows and come true
[59:51] to still show salvation and in dealing
[59:54] with no side but gives them to point
[59:58] once Adam and Eve had done wrong then
[1:00:04] everybody born from that day on was born
[1:00:08] in sin according to the psalmist shapen
[1:00:11] in iniquity the spouse from your
[1:00:13] mother's wound and go forth alive now
[1:00:16] you won't find all em scriptures the way
[1:00:18] I quoted but you'll find it the way the
[1:00:21] prophet quoted it and you'll find its
[1:00:23] way the bible quotes but it's right
[1:00:26] right so Cain and Abel which Abel was
[1:00:30] just as perverted as Cain no no if I
[1:00:34] come from if I come from Adam I can be
[1:00:36] saved if I come from the Beast I can't
[1:00:38] be saved that's the doctrine in the
[1:00:41] people of this message they literally
[1:00:46] believe if you're born from Cain you
[1:00:49] know through that lineage you don't have
[1:00:50] a change but if you're born true Abel
[1:00:54] and coming where you wouldn't have much
[1:00:56] change with a people cuz he got killed
[1:00:59] so you better get it over to worse after
[1:01:01] that at least right would you understand
[1:01:09] everybody born died away when they reach
[1:01:16] the age of accountability and you
[1:01:20] determine what that is I've checked the
[1:01:23] prophets message for 40 years never
[1:01:25] heard him making a date see I've heard a
[1:01:30] lot about what he says is when you know
[1:01:32] the difference and right and wrong when
[1:01:36] you're when you come to a knowledge of
[1:01:38] something like I said about the little
[1:01:41] kids put them in the tub you know but
[1:01:43] then when they become to a knowledge of
[1:01:45] each other you better get them out of
[1:01:47] there like I said but my children are so
[1:01:52] wonderful they wouldn't do that
[1:01:55] you got a belly full of guts to come one
[1:01:58] day because you're gonna have a problem
[1:02:00] and when you do you're gonna come back
[1:02:03] and say what brother tell you and I've
[1:02:06] had people to do this they come and said
[1:02:08] what did I do wrong now I don't mean
[1:02:11] just I'm just using an example brother
[1:02:14] Dave I don't know what I done wrong but
[1:02:16] I'll let my kids play in the bathtub 15
[1:02:18] years old you dummy
[1:02:22] you know what's he doing wrong I don't
[1:02:25] have to tell you cuz you know what
[1:02:28] you're going now argue with me come on
[1:02:33] I'm open tell me you and how beautiful
[1:02:38] you were
[1:02:39] and you say you're picking on me brother
[1:02:41] I'm picking on everybody in here not
[1:02:45] just one everybody in here
[1:02:47] but you want to have enough sense to
[1:02:48] know I said well he came but it did to
[1:02:54] me I know but it was everything 5050
[1:02:58] see Satan used in the Old Testament the
[1:03:04] rim of memory reason conscience and
[1:03:07] things to get to the people to make them
[1:03:11] partake of the wrong things all right
[1:03:14] he not only done that through the memory
[1:03:17] reason conscious he done it through the
[1:03:20] soul of mankind because remember the
[1:03:26] Bible says zekiel 18 for all souls are
[1:03:33] mine so they ain't no show coming from
[1:03:38] the devil he said all souls are mine now
[1:03:45] what goes wrong with that soul how does
[1:03:52] it become sinful when it is created as
[1:03:56] perfect that's perfect it can be there's
[1:03:58] a lot different perfect in eternal so
[1:04:00] don't translate me in there ever person
[1:04:04] in the world they don't matter who the
[1:04:05] mom and daddy is that baby when it comes
[1:04:08] in the world that soul is this perfect
[1:04:12] as God could make it I don't care who it
[1:04:15] belongs to
[1:04:18] now you ain't going like this then who
[1:04:22] is it that allows the soul of that baby
[1:04:26] to wind up and get perverted oh now you
[1:04:37] you've got a wife preaching brother Dale
[1:04:39] you just Madeline now come on we're
[1:04:42] gonna meddle a whole lot more you tell
[1:04:44] me the truth you tell me the truth is
[1:04:50] that baby a sinner can't be a center
[1:04:54] until it reaches the age of
[1:04:55] accountability it's a product of seeing
[1:04:58] through Mama and Daddy but it is not a
[1:05:00] sinner until it reaches the age of
[1:05:03] accountability to know right and wrong
[1:05:05] did it become the sinner
[1:05:08] what is it until that time come on I got
[1:05:13] him play in here your prophet they asked
[1:05:15] him said what about baby sometimes he
[1:05:23] said even said you mean you got to have
[1:05:24] the Holy Ghost said you thought we got
[1:05:26] our home ghost ago in the rapture he
[1:05:27] said would you explain the babies to me
[1:05:32] he said all babies it don't matter what
[1:05:36] under the age of accountability through
[1:05:39] the blood of Jesus cry all babies go to
[1:05:41] heaven I used to think about it that God
[1:05:46] would tell those people David or some of
[1:05:48] them said go out to her and in Mirat
[1:05:51] senescence hid types or whatever he say
[1:05:52] just kill him everyone he said men and
[1:05:56] women and children kill him every one
[1:06:04] you think work hard I thought you was
[1:06:07] let's got a sympathy how can you allow
[1:06:12] them to kill them babies I can
[1:06:15] understand how you allow them to kill
[1:06:17] the grown-ups
[1:06:18] cuz that's sand and milled and don't
[1:06:21] what
[1:06:21] baby you realize all of them babies it
[1:06:29] was under the age of accountability he
[1:06:31] done him a favor he took their life and
[1:06:35] they'll go to heaven one day oh we
[1:06:40] didn't know that well it's time to wake
[1:06:43] up
[1:06:47] all babies go to heaven
[1:06:50] that's what Iran said will will will the
[1:06:52] illegitimate baby going to rapture he
[1:06:55] said now I can't hardly I don't
[1:06:57] understand that part but he said just
[1:06:59] remember all babies go to heaven now
[1:07:04] I'll give you a quote where he says now
[1:07:06] listen he says now the Bible doesn't say
[1:07:10] that you mean read it he said I say it
[1:07:21] he said on the basis of want to see well
[1:07:26] I've answered the question to a lot of
[1:07:27] people how many in your angle national
[1:07:31] raise of hands and please don't come
[1:07:32] ones turn around about do you realize
[1:07:35] that everybody in here could be
[1:07:37] illegitimate my mom and daddy was
[1:07:44] married you thought of old my mama no
[1:07:52] I'm telling the truth
[1:07:54] I love my mother I've told you over and
[1:07:59] over I respected her because she raised
[1:08:02] me but I also know that my mother was a
[1:08:06] woman
[1:08:10] mother you better not run it back you
[1:08:14] might find out a few things in the way
[1:08:19] you run it back down the line you might
[1:08:21] find and I'm not throwing slangs and
[1:08:23] nobody telling the truth you might find
[1:08:25] somebody a little bit darker colored in
[1:08:28] your race
[1:08:29] if you swore that there's no black race
[1:08:32] in my family
[1:08:35] see that's why you're wrong Church you
[1:08:38] take me and beat me down because I tell
[1:08:40] you the truth I'm just trying to tell
[1:08:42] you the truth I'm trying to tell it like
[1:08:47] he told it I don't care
[1:08:50] I don't care if I'm a legitimate ten
[1:08:53] generations I don't care the blood of
[1:08:58] Jesus Christ takes care of every bit of
[1:09:01] that right so it's not where mama and
[1:09:07] daddy was right it's whether or not
[1:09:09] we're right with Jesus Christ and then I
[1:09:13] throw it off on nobody I know you say he
[1:09:18] was shedding talk like that in front of
[1:09:19] people it sold off of my mama then they
[1:09:26] call brother Branham your mama paid you
[1:09:28] price between her and God she lived with
[1:09:31] her God you got to live to another
[1:09:34] things I ain't told nobody this your
[1:09:38] mama and daddy was this or that or the
[1:09:39] other I'm just trying to make a point I
[1:09:42] don't care if Mama and Daddy Bo was the
[1:09:45] illegitimate for 10 generations in my
[1:09:47] family it's the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:09:50] that I depend upon to make me appointed
[1:09:54] to to a place that I can believe in
[1:09:56] salvation then I made the statement from
[1:10:06] it at random do you believe that an
[1:10:12] illegitimate child going after he said
[1:10:14] now I don't know about that rapture he
[1:10:17] said but all babies go to heaven but
[1:10:22] just remember if that baby grows to the
[1:10:26] age of accountability and accepts Jesus
[1:10:29] Christ
[1:10:29] it ain't illegitimate no more ain't no
[1:10:35] cause if if the Bible would be writing
[1:10:37] the Old Testament to say 10 generations
[1:10:39] could bleed it out then why can't we
[1:10:42] believe in the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:10:43] bleeding and all the were we can thank
[1:10:47] God
[1:10:48] for the truth salvation is of the Lord
[1:10:53] any what mean you thinks about what
[1:10:55] we're doing but I've answered that
[1:10:58] question when they say well what do you
[1:11:00] think now let me give an illustration I
[1:11:03] won't call them name but it said family
[1:11:08] do you believe in a compassionate God or
[1:11:12] God or sympathy a God of sympathy you
[1:11:15] look like would take everybody but a God
[1:11:17] of compassion is where he can't break
[1:11:19] his word but you realize that until
[1:11:25] those babies reach the age of
[1:11:27] accountability I just ask you a simple
[1:11:29] question
[1:11:31] you mean you and your wife is gonna go
[1:11:34] in the rapture but you got a 2 year old
[1:11:36] baby is it going in the tribulation now
[1:11:46] come on I don't believe in that kind of
[1:11:47] a God I'd be a god of sympathy no I
[1:11:50] believe in a God of compassion do you
[1:11:54] understand what I'm getting at is he
[1:11:57] going to take the mom and daddy in the
[1:11:58] rapture but leave the babies here I
[1:12:03] don't agree with it so that I mean
[1:12:05] that's that's for me I'm playing all
[1:12:09] right I'm running out of time
[1:12:15] listen what was going on back there it's
[1:12:21] still going on now - mankind is in the
[1:12:25] same shape he's lost her he's lost now
[1:12:31] so God has to start dealing with mankind
[1:12:34] to bring us to salvation and as he
[1:12:41] starts dealing with us he's naturally
[1:12:44] going to have to start dealing with us
[1:12:45] in our sin our second dream which is
[1:12:48] memory reason conscience affections
[1:12:50] because that's his only in road to get
[1:12:53] to your soul brother Browns anything and
[1:12:57] soldiers and prison of leaders right
[1:12:58] says he can get that soldier stand still
[1:13:00] long enough
[1:13:05] the income to salvation but now here is
[1:13:14] where we're connected for what is man
[1:13:22] judged upon what is man judged we'll see
[1:13:33] we automatically think that a judgment
[1:13:34] is upon the basis of something we do or
[1:13:36] don't do right I mean it was a judgment
[1:13:42] a judgment is on the basis of something
[1:13:45] you do or don't do right I mean it for
[1:13:47] some reason you've done something you
[1:13:48] got to be judged right now think about
[1:13:56] it how is the heathen to be judged
[1:14:05] now you look up the word he's earnest
[1:14:08] Gentile it's all kind of it just simply
[1:14:11] means the best enough definition you
[1:14:13] come up for heathen is not this race of
[1:14:16] people or that race of people or that
[1:14:19] race of people it is simply a person who
[1:14:23] does not believe in Jesus Christ as his
[1:14:32] Savior if you know a better definition
[1:14:35] than a heathen we think of a heathen
[1:14:41] being those in Africa that never heard
[1:14:43] in brother Adam says before that girl
[1:14:47] can marry in that heathen tribe she has
[1:14:50] to go take a virgin C test and he said
[1:14:53] if it's something wrong said they'd kill
[1:14:55] her and him both what was his word and
[1:15:00] he said boy what would it be in America
[1:15:02] right
[1:15:09] how can a heathen be judged that knows
[1:15:15] nothing about your God now use it that
[1:15:19] way because see every even has a God of
[1:15:21] his own right India they got how many -
[1:15:25] brother Prakash 30,000 or 30 million 3
[1:15:29] million yeah 3 million gods and
[1:15:31] goddesses so now this get the word God
[1:15:35] out of your mind that way a heathen is
[1:15:39] not a Jew or a Gentile see the Jew says
[1:15:45] the healing is the Gentile cuz he don't
[1:15:50] believe in God he believes in a God at
[1:15:53] some form some way some thoughts but he
[1:15:59] doesn't believe in the Jehovah
[1:16:01] so then the Jews would call everything
[1:16:03] around him either
[1:16:07] not signifying a different or you know
[1:16:11] mohammedans and this heaven isn't this
[1:16:13] and happened to Jeff's eyes and his
[1:16:15] sight no no it's anything that was
[1:16:18] contrary to believe in in Jehovah his
[1:16:23] Almighty God would be called a heathen
[1:16:30] now how is God gonna judge that heathen
[1:16:32] when he never hears the gospel he's
[1:16:40] taking what you want - when I heard the
[1:16:43] Prophet say the things that I just read
[1:16:44] for 40 years I've studied it I said Lord
[1:16:52] how can that be
[1:16:58] what would be the basis how will God
[1:17:04] judge someone who never hears of him I
[1:17:13] get to hater you don't believe um and
[1:17:21] ask you a question are you Jews or you
[1:17:24] Gentiles well well we're Gentiles with
[1:17:29] in the way we believe in one God the
[1:17:32] Jews don't believe in it
[1:17:33] so are they he then-- oh right
[1:17:41] you're not as you are you your believer
[1:17:45] in the Lord Jesus Christ and the Jews
[1:17:47] don't believe in that is he either what
[1:17:51] is it Eden he's an unbeliever what is he
[1:18:00] gonna like it
[1:18:04] how is a honest now listen let's get the
[1:18:08] word right
[1:18:10] LaRon says I got him laying here to be
[1:18:13] glad to read him we get to he says that
[1:18:17] God said a lot of people get the word
[1:18:19] sympathy and compassion messed up he
[1:18:23] said sympathy is like mankind he said
[1:18:26] compassion is to do the will of the
[1:18:29] Father he said like the Lord Jesus went
[1:18:32] into the pool and walked in there with
[1:18:35] all them people and said he healed one
[1:18:38] person and turned and walked out and
[1:18:43] watching he said then God is a God of
[1:18:46] compassion because he's doing the will
[1:18:49] of the Father
[1:18:49] a God of sympathy would have to heal
[1:18:53] every one of them now wait a minute I
[1:18:56] got said come on this stuff quote it to
[1:18:58] you I know he died for everybody I know
[1:19:01] that come on he wants everybody to be
[1:19:03] safe we know that we'll get the point
[1:19:06] God is not a God of sympathy
[1:19:10] is a God of compassion he stays with his
[1:19:14] word he'll keep his word and as I said
[1:19:24] when the prophet made these statements
[1:19:26] going over brothers to number eight over
[1:19:37] the message the handwriting on the wall
[1:19:41] in the book of Acts the 10th chapter in
[1:19:44] the 35th verse the Prophet said I
[1:19:47] perceive that God is no respect of
[1:19:49] nation or person but will accept such as
[1:19:53] will serve Him in righteousness no
[1:19:57] matter what church you belong to God
[1:20:00] expects you to what respect him God
[1:20:11] expects you to respect him and he wants
[1:20:15] you to serve Him in righteousness than
[1:20:20] what you if we fail to take them the
[1:20:24] gospel he's changing his style right
[1:20:27] they should have made another paragraph
[1:20:28] and brought it out but all right he said
[1:20:32] he wants you to serve him in Russia if
[1:20:34] we fail to take them the gospel who the
[1:20:39] heathen right then God will judge them
[1:20:44] according to the knowledge that they had
[1:20:48] and how respectable they were to it even
[1:21:03] if we don't take the gospel God is going
[1:21:07] to judge them according to the knowledge
[1:21:10] they had and how respectable they was to
[1:21:18] it
[1:21:23] mio canale you're talking about some
[1:21:26] kind of heater and can't go to heaven we
[1:21:29] ain't gonna take them to heaven taking
[1:21:31] the millennium for to go to heaven
[1:21:34] okay can we solve the problem go ahead
[1:21:40] to the next questions and answers 1962
[1:21:47] they're talking about sowing the seed
[1:21:49] where's reaping of the seed Elisha and
[1:21:52] then it's return of the church and the
[1:21:55] bride the bride of Christ shall walk out
[1:21:58] upon their ashes in the Millennium when
[1:22:00] the earth is purified by fire and dire
[1:22:04] they shall reign remember the Bible
[1:22:07] speaks it's gonna rule and reign with
[1:22:09] him for a thousand years
[1:22:10] then watch you he said you got out
[1:22:11] something ruling right over come on and
[1:22:16] are they shall reign and the he turned
[1:22:19] that's never heard the gospel
[1:22:21] she'll be raised in that time this is
[1:22:29] the Millennium he just said it and the
[1:22:35] sons of God will be manifested if he's
[1:22:39] the rain he's got a house something rain
[1:22:41] over he's got a domain and they ruled
[1:22:44] and reigned with Christ and Christ
[1:22:45] ruling with a rod of iron the nations
[1:22:47] then the then the manifested sons of God
[1:22:50] with the authority just like he had when
[1:22:53] he was here see I will come the
[1:22:55] Millennium in that rain the ether is
[1:23:01] going to be in the Millennium to hear
[1:23:07] the gospel alright there you are you
[1:23:11] sure ain't no Baptist call.we Baptist
[1:23:14] believe you got to be born again to go
[1:23:18] to heaven anybody wants to pull up it
[1:23:25] the Prophet says there'll be a gospel to
[1:23:29] the heathen in the Millenium he said if
[1:23:33] we don't get it to him they'll be judged
[1:23:37] how by how they kept their own laws you
[1:23:47] mean see then he's not a goddess empathy
[1:23:54] sympathy would require him to save all
[1:23:57] kind no we've got a point now we're on a
[1:24:07] road running with it right
[1:24:10] forty-something yours now Lord would you
[1:24:15] please that tell me how you gonna get
[1:24:16] that he turned into the Millennium he
[1:24:22] said I'm gonna get them there because
[1:24:23] they keep their own laws they don't hear
[1:24:27] the gospel they don't hear nobody preach
[1:24:29] so they can't be judged on what they
[1:24:31] hear right
[1:24:33] so they're judged on what they do with
[1:24:35] their own laws but but that's a
[1:24:40] compassionate God they would take his
[1:24:43] own wheel in his own word and say listen
[1:24:46] if you won't take the gospel to them
[1:24:48] I'll just make a secondary way is that
[1:24:50] the quote we just read he said if we
[1:24:53] don't do it God will do it girl in the
[1:25:03] Millennium I didn't say that your
[1:25:07] prophet did I've never heard so nonsense
[1:25:13] and all of that you've got to do it some
[1:25:15] way through the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:25:19] well I would remind you that under the
[1:25:23] Old Testament they didn't have the blood
[1:25:25] of Jesus Christ all they had was
[1:25:31] speaking of it what about a
[1:25:36] compassionate God Church and wacked out
[1:25:40] a lot of thoughts but what about a
[1:25:42] compassionate God one who will do the
[1:25:46] will of the Father
[1:25:49] and the Father's will is that if you
[1:25:52] don't we don't take the gospel to the
[1:25:55] heathen he will bypass always and bring
[1:26:03] them up you say give me the scripture
[1:26:07] glad you thought of that back up to
[1:26:10] number seven glad you said give me the
[1:26:13] scripture I read it to you when we
[1:26:17] started did you listen me back on number
[1:26:22] seven where there is no respect of
[1:26:26] persons with God Romans 2 11 through 15
[1:26:31] whereas many is that sin without the law
[1:26:36] she'll perish without the law in other
[1:26:39] words if you / if you die without having
[1:26:42] any law there is a benefits of following
[1:26:46] the law because he was with the tribes
[1:26:49] he was with the children of Israel you
[1:26:50] had a lot of benefits following the law
[1:26:54] well got people you could be with
[1:26:57] another so now what's he saying for as
[1:26:59] many as have sinned without the law in
[1:27:03] other words law ain't and effects are
[1:27:04] they seeing what's gonna happen
[1:27:06] she'll also purchase without the law cuz
[1:27:08] they ain't got nothing to represent them
[1:27:10] and as many as I've sinned in the law
[1:27:13] she'll be judged by the law so there's a
[1:27:19] group of people it's never heard the law
[1:27:21] they're not judged by the law they're
[1:27:26] judged by their own conscience we're
[1:27:27] gonna read that and what for as many as
[1:27:34] have sinned and his has been seen in the
[1:27:37] law she'll be judged by the law for not
[1:27:40] the hearers of the law or just before
[1:27:43] God but the doers of the law
[1:27:46] she'll be justified as that settled not
[1:27:51] to hear but to do her right now watch
[1:27:56] the Gentile be a doer of the law
[1:27:58] now what you gonna do with him
[1:28:01] even condemn him when he follows the law
[1:28:05] and you don't know what you're gonna do
[1:28:07] it said forty years folks I've studied
[1:28:13] it and pondered it we're not two hearers
[1:28:19] of the law just before God but the doers
[1:28:21] of the law shall be justified for when
[1:28:24] the Gentiles misused the word heathen
[1:28:27] they're okay when the Gentiles which
[1:28:30] have not the law do by nature the things
[1:28:39] contained in the law in other words by
[1:28:43] nature by some nature something within
[1:28:46] them is motivating them to follow a
[1:28:50] right channel are you with me for when
[1:28:56] the Gentiles which have not the law do
[1:29:00] by nature you go to the some of you come
[1:29:04] from some of the tribes are different
[1:29:06] this use it as an example you know there
[1:29:08] was good people in those tribes right
[1:29:12] we'll get to that in a second cause I
[1:29:14] got some more questions asking they do
[1:29:17] by nature the things contained in the
[1:29:18] law these having not the law or law into
[1:29:22] themselves they follow the law by nature
[1:29:28] not by the fact that they have to and
[1:29:32] what it does it gives them the effect of
[1:29:35] the law salvation right how they going
[1:29:41] to be in the Millennium salvation now
[1:29:46] what these Gentile these either which
[1:29:52] show the work of the law written in
[1:29:55] their hearts come on
[1:30:02] their currency
[1:30:03] it's also bearing witness and their
[1:30:08] thoughts the mean while accusing or else
[1:30:12] excusing one another think about it
[1:30:26] think about how great God is he's not
[1:30:34] the God of sympathy is the God of
[1:30:39] compassion the word is rolled over and
[1:30:42] over so don't go haywire do on it get to
[1:30:45] pulling listen to what the Prophet says
[1:30:47] I'll be glad to give you those where he
[1:30:49] says compassion is to do the will of the
[1:30:51] Father
[1:30:51] alright let's read that where nobody
[1:30:53] won't get on the bandwagon and start
[1:30:56] screaming and hollering where's that
[1:31:02] okay go to number 12 which is taken from
[1:31:06] the earnestly contending for the faith
[1:31:07] that was once delivered to the Saints
[1:31:09] now what hold that in your mind
[1:31:11] sometimes you don't know what compassion
[1:31:15] means friend the people are so bound
[1:31:20] listen he says they're bound they don't
[1:31:22] understand heavenly things you remember
[1:31:26] what I said well ago we can talk about
[1:31:28] sympathy we can talk about compassion
[1:31:30] but let's talk about it the way God
[1:31:32] talks about it right we don't see
[1:31:39] compassion is to do the will of God not
[1:31:42] sympathy there's a lot of difference
[1:31:44] between sympathy and compassion dropping
[1:31:48] down to earth that's the way with human
[1:31:51] compassion and God's compassion
[1:31:55] compassion in the rims of spirit means
[1:31:59] to do the will of him that sent you
[1:32:03] human compassion is sympathy that's all
[1:32:08] there is sympathy moon dancers we would
[1:32:12] see Jesus there's two different types of
[1:32:15] compassion
[1:32:17] one of them is human sympathy the other
[1:32:21] one is godly compassion godly compassion
[1:32:25] is to do the will of God human sympathy
[1:32:28] droves everything in a puddle because
[1:32:34] the next one be not afraid
[1:32:37] it's verily verily I say unto you I can
[1:32:40] the son does nothing in himself with
[1:32:43] what he sees the father doing that doeth
[1:32:46] the son likewise that's compassion now
[1:32:54] am i quoting brother Branham through
[1:32:55] what he said he said when it when he was
[1:32:58] speaking like that in other words he's
[1:32:59] seen it he's seen the man that he walked
[1:33:03] in the pool and healed before he got
[1:33:06] there because he said I do nothing till
[1:33:11] my father shows me he knew it
[1:33:14] so the compassion was to do the will of
[1:33:16] the Father go in and heal the man he saw
[1:33:18] that would be healed and walk out
[1:33:22] sympathy would be try to heal everybody
[1:33:26] compassion is followed the will of God
[1:33:30] human sympathy not compassion oh it's
[1:33:34] two different types altogether sympathy
[1:33:37] and compassion are you listening so now
[1:33:48] let's take that heathen for a minute
[1:33:52] that he learned by his own laws in his
[1:33:55] tribes he lives the best again he's not
[1:34:01] a born again believer so don't even
[1:34:03] argue no something at me these straight
[1:34:07] listen he can only be judged of God by
[1:34:14] how much he follows the laws and the
[1:34:17] things that are surrounding him that's
[1:34:19] what Paul said he said that girl has to
[1:34:26] be taken out and check to see
[1:34:29] now that's pretty good laws on it now
[1:34:34] what are those laws to a heathen
[1:34:39] what are those laws make a book of rules
[1:34:44] what what are those laws the Bible talks
[1:34:52] about being an answer of a good
[1:34:54] conscience you realize the heathen then
[1:34:58] is gonna be judged on this conscience
[1:35:03] you'll be judged whether he's born again
[1:35:06] or not and I'm gonna do it he's gonna be
[1:35:09] judged by his conscience the Bible says
[1:35:15] you sear your conscience now I want to
[1:35:19] ask you two questions one is a baby born
[1:35:24] mean I'm asking you to answer your own
[1:35:32] question is a baby born mean you're
[1:35:44] mighty quiet cause you know for sure
[1:35:45] that I know what I'm talking about a
[1:35:47] baby ain't born mean it learns to be
[1:35:52] mean it sees and does as others it
[1:36:01] learns to be mean so he's in a sinner no
[1:36:13] he said well what are you talking about
[1:36:15] I'm talking about a baby till it reaches
[1:36:17] the age of accountability it is born
[1:36:21] perfectly thoughts and everything but as
[1:36:24] it becomes in time it learns to be mean
[1:36:35] in other words you take what you want to
[1:36:38] from this you and me trained our own
[1:36:41] children to be what they are now argue
[1:36:45] with me come on somebody get up come up
[1:36:50] here and tell me I'm wrong
[1:36:51] but you're going to be facing 40 years
[1:36:54] of studied of the Word of God to be one
[1:36:56] thing that's why I'm not afraid to say
[1:36:58] it
[1:36:59] you and me taught our children to be
[1:37:02] wrong like I've always said when the
[1:37:05] baby is born in a in a cradle born in a
[1:37:08] hospital what does it do it wakes up and
[1:37:14] the first thing that hears is a nurse is
[1:37:17] cussing and snorting by talking and
[1:37:19] hollering and screaming at each other
[1:37:20] calling each other names the baby is
[1:37:26] trained to do wrong you say brother Dale
[1:37:35] are you pointing to me I'm pointing at
[1:37:37] everybody in here we trained our
[1:37:41] children to be wrong I've always told
[1:37:47] you don't you dare slap that child in
[1:37:49] the face you'll answer to me if you do
[1:37:52] it's got a bottom in the place you can
[1:37:55] work on go you slap it in the face
[1:37:59] what's it gonna grow up to do it's gonna
[1:38:01] slap it come on am i right why is it the
[1:38:06] children they were molested my parents
[1:38:09] biggest portion of the time wind up
[1:38:12] molesting their own children am i right
[1:38:21] 40 years Lord give me an answer take a
[1:38:30] line and allow them and put it in the
[1:38:35] cage together as a baby all right
[1:38:42] they grow up to be great companions
[1:38:46] right and we're right they don't kill
[1:38:53] each other even when they get old enough
[1:38:56] they don't kill each other
[1:38:59] something has to create that atmosphere
[1:39:02] to make that animal kill that other one
[1:39:06] something has to try it and say let's go
[1:39:09] I find match Golden Rock not knowing how
[1:39:14] long we've all failed to raise our
[1:39:18] children in the right order we remember
[1:39:25] how you raise that child is what that
[1:39:27] child is going to be when it reaches the
[1:39:29] age of accountability it's gonna do what
[1:39:32] you walking out there how many of your
[1:39:35] father's know you walking alone not so
[1:39:40] brother Lewis words yeah he's hiding
[1:39:41] somewhere and he's got that walk well
[1:39:46] you want some kids they don't have that
[1:39:48] walk falling in my daddy's footsteps
[1:39:54] right that is telling Walt like that
[1:39:59] they learned if we what they're looking
[1:40:01] you raise your children in the
[1:40:05] admonition of the Lord
[1:40:07] don't you raise your children this away
[1:40:09] though don't you raise your children and
[1:40:11] tell them that God hates you cause
[1:40:14] you're mean you ain't got enough
[1:40:17] gumption to use a spanking spoon the law
[1:40:21] even now says you than you the belt you
[1:40:27] can't use planking spoons or hickories
[1:40:29] but it bypasses the belt do you
[1:40:34] understand what I'm getting at
[1:40:37] you said I've done the best I could do
[1:40:40] with my children I failed I failed
[1:40:47] because a lot of
[1:40:51] see we want them raised our way tell
[1:40:58] your story that happened
[1:41:02] Terrence one time we were going to
[1:41:06] brother would mr. priests Darren said
[1:41:08] daddy I don't want to go I said son
[1:41:11] you're going he's a dead head I want to
[1:41:17] go home they'll have to he's 16 years
[1:41:20] old I said you're going son well you
[1:41:24] know what he done he sneaked out and got
[1:41:26] gone for the time that we was going to
[1:41:28] leave and when he come back we didn't go
[1:41:36] we didn't go he said are you just stupid
[1:41:40] no I wanted to prove one point when he
[1:41:46] came in he said daddy why didn't you go
[1:41:47] I said because of what you've done and I
[1:41:55] didn't go preach for the weekend he said
[1:41:58] daddy he turned around he said wilt me
[1:42:07] that's a no sir he knows what I say it I
[1:42:12] says you've got your own whip it your
[1:42:16] own whip and had done been given to you
[1:42:18] and he ain't forgot that till this day
[1:42:21] he got his whipping and I never had to
[1:42:24] touch him see we think that we've got to
[1:42:28] do this and do that
[1:42:31] why did brother Brown say he said never
[1:42:33] whipped that child until you first want
[1:42:36] talk to him or consider what they're
[1:42:38] doing how many of us done that yeah we
[1:42:44] expect our children to be right we go
[1:42:50] out and do wrong and our children do
[1:42:51] wrong then we whip them for doing wrong
[1:42:53] that's that's good innit
[1:42:58] you said what are you getting at
[1:43:02] I'm getting at one time after 40 years
[1:43:06] the Lord speaking to me I've come to one
[1:43:12] conclusion man would be judged by his
[1:43:24] own conscious you say yeah but I'm born
[1:43:29] again
[1:43:33] your conscience still bothers you if it
[1:43:37] don't something wrong
[1:43:39] remember your conscious is in your
[1:43:41] second rim you don't look at your
[1:43:49] children sometimes and say Lord I wish
[1:43:51] I'd have done different you ever
[1:43:59] apologize to your children you know we
[1:44:07] come up through the rules and
[1:44:08] regulations of the message you know you
[1:44:12] can talk to these kids and find out some
[1:44:15] of you that didn't come up that way we
[1:44:16] come up rules and regulations that our
[1:44:18] children had to do this and they had to
[1:44:20] do that they take them out of school in
[1:44:22] Georgia and send them to Alabama and
[1:44:24] take the ones out of Alabama and send
[1:44:26] them to Georgia where they could bypass
[1:44:27] the laws who calls brother Brown said
[1:44:34] him and then schools is of the devil
[1:44:37] ain't letting my chances go screw the
[1:44:40] devil take him out of school put him to
[1:44:43] work
[1:44:43] the public job put him to work the
[1:44:50] public job that's not worse if the devil
[1:44:55] oh but we raised our children right you
[1:45:02] ask the people this magic I don't see
[1:45:04] why my children like they are I raised
[1:45:06] them right
[1:45:09] I've apologized to the kids the same I
[1:45:18] didn't do it right but if you don't get
[1:45:22] the point I'll give it to you in one
[1:45:23] other point I said it while ago now
[1:45:25] let's think about it what is the age of
[1:45:31] accountability we've concluded that it
[1:45:39] is the point of in the life of a person
[1:45:41] that they reach that they become
[1:45:44] knowledgeable of right and wrong but
[1:45:52] what if you lived in some country where
[1:45:53] there's countries overseas they still
[1:45:56] have polygamy well that's God that
[1:46:02] they're gonna be condemned for being
[1:46:03] polygamous no cuz that's their tribes
[1:46:09] and their laws but they're gonna be
[1:46:12] judged how they handle the polygamy I
[1:46:14] like brother Theo Erasmus I got I loved
[1:46:18] a brother he said they went and found a
[1:46:20] group of people over there living in the
[1:46:22] ground
[1:46:23] and he said they was just wasn't married
[1:46:25] or nothing they just lived with each
[1:46:27] other and slept in this had babies over
[1:46:29] and they wanted to become Christians you
[1:46:34] know he said does have a meeting he said
[1:46:40] we're gonna solve this problem
[1:46:43] took them out lined them up said all
[1:46:46] right there you are
[1:46:50] who's your wife well I got eight pick
[1:46:56] out one cause that's gonna be your wife
[1:47:00] from now
[1:47:05] now what could you done under his
[1:47:08] situation he said yeah but that would've
[1:47:11] left 7up and it didn't have a husband if
[1:47:15] brother Theo was any man at all you know
[1:47:16] what he said
[1:47:18] you got one wife you live with one not
[1:47:21] one wife and husband wife but you don't
[1:47:24] support the mother seven now you tell me
[1:47:29] that ain't a Christian attitude see
[1:47:34] we're not dealing with things as
[1:47:36] Christian attitude a lot we're dealing
[1:47:38] with things of what we want the way we
[1:47:41] want to do and what we want to do that's
[1:47:43] what I've said for 40 years I prayed God
[1:47:46] show me some way to understand that
[1:47:51] either and why you would allow him he
[1:47:57] said he's keeping the laws of his land
[1:48:00] and said I'm honoring him for keeping
[1:48:04] them laws because what happens to a guy
[1:48:07] that don't keep the laws it turned out
[1:48:08] to be me oh we're not through with the
[1:48:14] story what happens to a man in the tribe
[1:48:16] that's mean out of the tribe or off the
[1:48:18] head right I'm not throwing off on none
[1:48:22] of you black people now you get this me
[1:48:24] and you own if you don't run this thing
[1:48:26] straight it's your problem and I ain't
[1:48:29] never had no racism I didn't have it for
[1:48:31] coming this message not sure you got it
[1:48:33] now I'm just using the illustration what
[1:48:38] about those heathen be in the Millennium
[1:48:41] and you know what if they're in the
[1:48:43] Millennium now you tell me they're gonna
[1:48:45] be cast into hell I'm gonna tell you I
[1:48:47] don't believe that I don't believe
[1:48:49] they're gonna be judged in the
[1:48:50] millennium and say all right so you go
[1:48:52] you can go to heaven but you going to
[1:48:53] hell you gonna have them you're gonna
[1:48:54] help now I forget it don't bring that to
[1:48:58] me cuz he done got him to the Millennium
[1:49:05] they're gonna go in and remember there's
[1:49:08] gonna be people around that city there's
[1:49:12] going to be either a
[1:49:16] to see he and the bride is going to be
[1:49:19] in the city and it matches her without
[1:49:22] side of either kings of the earth
[1:49:24] they bring their honor and glory into
[1:49:26] that city and you just think about that
[1:49:30] little old brother he said I don't
[1:49:35] understand why he'd choose me you know
[1:49:42] what now here's where we're going where
[1:49:44] we're going differ for opinion cards
[1:49:48] gonna look at him and say you done by
[1:49:50] nature the inside of a person that knows
[1:49:55] nothing about me but yet you followed my
[1:49:58] word by your own inward nature that's
[1:50:01] what Paul said you don't read it again
[1:50:05] and sitting there by you've been allowed
[1:50:08] to enter in God is a compassionate God
[1:50:15] you got a guard a sympathy
[1:50:17] let's tan sorry for being a little late
[1:50:21] wanting to get it out in the heart we
[1:50:25] ain't finished we just started you see I
[1:50:28] believe in compassion not sympathy but
[1:50:34] that we sympathize with everything right
[1:50:37] well come on I sympathize with somebody
[1:50:39] see I see these children I do especially
[1:50:42] the children or something and so those
[1:50:44] children come over here to be prayed for
[1:50:45] and I see them not receive right then
[1:50:48] what they're asking for I just inside
[1:50:50] upset God where did I do wrong
[1:50:54] then not afraid God where did I do wrong
[1:50:58] why didn't that child get healed
[1:51:01] I don't blame anything else I'd blame
[1:51:04] myself you see a God of compassion is
[1:51:11] different than the God of sympathy and
[1:51:16] when we get the nature of that God come
[1:51:20] on the heathen by his own laws
[1:51:25] and the way he lives by is where he's
[1:51:31] gonna be able to go hello but I've never
[1:51:39] heard anything like you teach brother
[1:51:40] day I never I thought we had to do this
[1:51:42] and I thought we had to do that I
[1:51:43] thought it had to be if you don't
[1:51:45] understand may I say it one more time
[1:51:50] what did God look at in you to save you
[1:51:56] you answer me a question was there any
[1:52:00] good thing within us that he could look
[1:52:02] at to save us I wouldn't be anything
[1:52:05] that would cause him to even deal with
[1:52:07] us come on I'm saying something that
[1:52:11] you're gonna probably argue with me
[1:52:12] about it but remember he's looking at
[1:52:16] that nature that's within you you know
[1:52:22] what I'm talking about there's people
[1:52:24] who have good natures but there's a lot
[1:52:27] of people in hide that nature being
[1:52:28] beans the devil okay but they are
[1:52:31] peaceful that just have a good nature
[1:52:33] about him what does God look at to bring
[1:52:36] him towards you your nature your ability
[1:52:42] to believe he's the ability to believe
[1:52:49] yeah because a lot of people can't
[1:52:52] believe see some of you in some one
[1:52:55] Internet you've already sealed it off
[1:52:57] and said I don't believe what that man
[1:52:59] talking about I've told you if I'm wrong
[1:53:05] I've had 40 years to study and pray and
[1:53:11] that's God why God would you choose me
[1:53:16] why would you choose anybody and he
[1:53:22] looks down and he says because you
[1:53:24] accepted me then I could come and
[1:53:29] fulfill whether I had already accepted
[1:53:31] you before the foundation in the world I
[1:53:33] could transmit it down to you
[1:53:38] like I said what is an unconditional
[1:53:41] covenant you mean you think you're
[1:53:44] living under unconditional codn't you
[1:53:45] can live like the devil you are the
[1:53:47] devil that's the best way to say it an
[1:53:50] unconditional covenant don't give you
[1:53:52] the right sin do wrong and halt and
[1:53:54] cover all of it remember the Bible we're
[1:53:58] going to give an account for the deeds
[1:54:00] done in the body whether good or bad
[1:54:03] that's Christians that's not sinners
[1:54:06] that's Christians so it's not just an
[1:54:11] unconditional they don't matter what I
[1:54:13] do that's worse than a Baptist I'll come
[1:54:18] out of the Baptist Church so don't argue
[1:54:19] with me about it
[1:54:20] that's worse than they did there's
[1:54:22] things they wouldn't do that some of you
[1:54:24] do they wouldn't do it for nothing in
[1:54:29] the world the worst sin of all is to
[1:54:36] doubt go ahead what do we got sorry 20
[1:54:39] after nine I'm sorry they had to take a
[1:54:42] little bit to get it out I know see I
[1:54:53] believe in a compassionate God
[1:54:56] but do the will of the Father might have
[1:55:02] water here seaweeds still got a lot of
[1:55:05] Scripture
[1:55:07] working the thing form say why did you
[1:55:10] form me this is what right when he did
[1:55:17] inform us out of what we might access
[1:55:24] sinners that's why the age of
[1:55:26] accountability I can't be no one certain
[1:55:29] age
[1:55:37] is when you realize
[1:55:41] if you're doing wrong you've become
[1:55:44] accountable and a compassionate God not
[1:55:53] to sympathize with us but to tell us
[1:55:58] that this is the windiest I'll do what I
[1:56:03] want to do yes because I'll do according
[1:56:06] to my word remember he can't break his
[1:56:10] word so when he judges the healer at the
[1:56:14] Millennium
[1:56:14] it's his word that's sadly to be done
[1:56:17] you can't condemn him for that cause
[1:56:20] he's done done it in form can't say why
[1:56:25] did you form me such have a name
[1:56:34] [Music]
[1:56:53] father we thank you for tonight we pray
[1:56:58] that what we said would be acceptable to
[1:57:01] your people that they would believe it
[1:57:04] Lord to just realize that those four oh
[1:57:09] he's earned that never heard of honey
[1:57:10] but yet you gonna give them a change but
[1:57:14] yet you're not gonna leave us out of it
[1:57:17] because they're gonna be our be there
[1:57:20] for us to speak to them about you what a
[1:57:26] wonderful God no wonder you're the God
[1:57:28] of compassion not the God of sympathy
[1:57:32] you know what your word says and you'll
[1:57:35] do what your word says no wonder the
[1:57:39] little virgin standing there said be it
[1:57:41] unto me according to thy word because
[1:57:45] she called it you be it under this
[1:57:48] church according to that word whatever
[1:57:49] it takes to drive us to a place to get
[1:57:53] us to the right understanding
[1:57:57] the directress into your love
[1:58:07] lord
[1:58:11] we've tried to say the best we could
[1:58:14] will be misunderstood about the way we
[1:58:17] approach him but nice I can't help that
[1:58:20] Lord I've just said it because Lord
[1:58:24] you're gonna judge us by your word and
[1:58:26] what we do with it and maybe that he's
[1:58:31] earned that's never heard maybe he's
[1:58:33] never reached the age of accountability
[1:58:36] because he has nothing but his own rule
[1:58:38] of law what do we have Lord just forgive
[1:58:46] us go with us on the way home take care
[1:58:49] of everybody in Jesus name you dismiss
[1:58:54] remember Bible study Saturday
[1:58:56] [Music]
[1:59:05] Oh
[1:59:10] freez Calvary's tree
[1:59:15] I love you yes I love him
[1:59:31] [Music]
