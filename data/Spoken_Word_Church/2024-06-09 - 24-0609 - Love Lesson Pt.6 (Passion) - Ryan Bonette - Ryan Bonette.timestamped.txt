[0:00] pray for me also teaching the Sunday
[0:01] school class here this
[0:15] morning so I'm continue on my love
[0:18] lesson series All About Love especially
[0:21] love of God but just love in general um
[0:24] and this one is going to be a lesson on
[0:27] passion and um so um I want to uh stress
[0:31] the point right off the bat that there's
[0:33] a lot of things uh that passion can mean
[0:35] and a lot of things I'm talking about
[0:36] and some I'm not I'm not really talking
[0:38] about lustful beastly passion I'm
[0:40] talking about our passion and our love
[0:41] for Christ primarily and then love for
[0:44] spouse love for children love for one
[0:45] another to be passionate about it means
[0:48] to be sincere you know to really put
[0:49] your heart into it and uh so let's uh
[0:53] let's keep that in mind and I'm also
[0:54] going to have to back up and review last
[0:56] lesson so um so I'll be short on time
[0:59] but I'll just try to get all I can in
[1:01] there and let's pray over this lesson
[1:03] Heavenly Father we pray just help me
[1:04] Lord in teaching this lesson and let it
[1:06] be a blessing to your people here Lord
[1:07] and those that hear uh later on on the
[1:09] internet and uh just give me the the
[1:11] right things to say Lord that uh be an
[1:13] encouragement to everybody and help us
[1:15] Lord to be more passionate in our
[1:16] service to you and in our love for you
[1:19] and for one another and um as we live in
[1:22] an age Lord where love is grown so cold
[1:25] among so many father help us to just
[1:27] burn with passion and love for you and
[1:29] for one another and for our families and
[1:32] everything else in Jesus name
[1:35] amen so uh first of all just few
[1:38] definitions as I said there's a lot of
[1:40] things passion can mean but just just to
[1:42] name a few definitions here of course we
[1:44] know it means the suffering of Christ
[1:46] between the night of the last supper and
[1:47] his death so has to do with suffering
[1:50] also there is a level of emotion
[1:52] involved with passion um it also means
[1:56] an intense driving or overmastering
[1:58] feeling or conviction
[2:00] Ardent affection or love a strong uh
[2:04] liking or desire for or Devotion to some
[2:08] activity object or concept so that
[2:10] includes you know we all have passions
[2:12] and loves for hobbies and things in life
[2:15] um you know that we can think of and
[2:17] there's nothing wrong with that as long
[2:18] as you don't put that before the Lord I
[2:21] might I might refer to that for an
[2:22] example here in a little bit if I get
[2:24] time and then also an object or desire
[2:28] or uh or deep
[2:31] interest and to lack passion is to be
[2:35] cold formal or indifferent so that's
[2:38] kind of like the opposite of passion
[2:39] just to kind of stress what I'm talking
[2:42] about here and what I'm what the
[2:44] opposite of that would be in
[2:45] Christianity a lack of passion is
[2:47] powerless religion having a form of
[2:49] godliness but denying the power thereof
[2:52] second Timothy 2 um in Revelation 3:16 I
[2:55] believe that's to the L to seene ages I
[2:57] recall so then because Thou Art lukew
[2:59] warm and neither cold nor hot I will
[3:01] spew the out of my mouth in our day
[3:04] people are kind of just indifferent
[3:06] about everything they just don't care
[3:07] one way or another you know serve Christ
[3:09] or not you know it's just an age of
[3:11] indifference indifference toward one
[3:13] another indifference toward God and so
[3:17] let me stay on that slide just for a
[3:18] minute before I review my last
[3:22] lesson so um this is kind of a
[3:24] self-reflection well really all these
[3:26] lessons I'm teaching about love are a
[3:28] self-reflection so think about as I
[3:30] teach this and whether you are
[3:32] passionate or not whether you have this
[3:33] passion I'm talking about this Burning
[3:35] passionate love for God and for your
[3:38] fellow
[3:39] men um as uh I think of passion this
[3:43] last Sunday I was standing up here and
[3:45] thinking of this whole cloud of very
[3:47] passionate men that were up here of all
[3:50] these ministers brother Dale was up here
[3:52] brother Wilson brother Harris and all of
[3:54] our other ministers and to thank of all
[3:58] these men who are so overcome with
[4:00] passion in their lives for Christ for
[4:02] his bride for the word of God and it was
[4:06] uh it was a very inspiring moment to me
[4:08] to be up here and be a part of that but
[4:10] those are examples of some men that I
[4:11] can name but then there are many in the
[4:13] congregation it's not just not just
[4:15] ministers that can be passionate as
[4:17] leoty too now one example that always
[4:20] stands out in my mind is these widows
[4:21] and widowers that even though the Lord
[4:24] took their spouse home they came right
[4:25] back to church the next service kept
[4:26] right on serving God to me that's an
[4:28] inspiration and example of passion so in
[4:31] love with the Lord that you just won't
[4:33] stop that's
[4:35] passion it comes from a sincere heart a
[4:38] genuine love that produces passion so I
[4:41] go back to reiterating the point of
[4:43] first fall in love with Christ and then
[4:44] the passion will come you don't really
[4:46] have to make it happen per se you just
[4:48] fall in love with the Lord It's a real
[4:49] simple process and you'll be
[4:52] passionate if passion is what drives you
[4:54] through your prayer closet it's what
[4:55] drives you to fast and pray and to trust
[4:58] in God in times of Temptation and trials
[5:01] it's if I could sum it up I would say
[5:03] passion is love and action let's just
[5:06] sum it up that way the best definition I
[5:08] can think of passion is love and
[5:10] action so reviewing my last lesson I
[5:13] talked about how a beautiful picture I
[5:15] think it would be as I was on the
[5:17] subject of putting Christ in marriage
[5:19] how if let's just suppose this is a boy
[5:21] and a girl here in the lap of the Lord
[5:23] and they come to the Lord at an early
[5:25] age in life and they give their heart to
[5:28] him and serve him in their youth then
[5:31] they come to the age of marriage and
[5:33] they get married and they put Christ in
[5:34] their marriage walking forward with the
[5:36] Lord so then they're kind of
[5:37] reestablishing what was in the Garden of
[5:39] Eden in the original marriage was not
[5:42] just man and woman it was man and woman
[5:44] and the Lord and he was the head so
[5:48] Christ should be in marriage Beyond just
[5:49] the wedding day and that was the point I
[5:51] was stressing last time walk close with
[5:53] the Lord individually and with your
[5:56] spouse remove self from Marriage it's
[5:59] very important key in marriage and 1
[6:02] Corinthians 7 just uh a brief overview
[6:05] Paul here is talking about once you
[6:08] marry of course you're distracted from
[6:09] serving the lord you can't fully devote
[6:11] yourself to him like you could when you
[6:12] were single because now you have your
[6:14] spouse but you do need to tend to your
[6:16] spouse you do need to be in other words
[6:19] passionate about loving your spouse and
[6:22] um as well as loving the Lord but God
[6:26] above all else as I reiterated point
[6:28] last time many many many times through
[6:30] this series I'm I'm trying to make sure
[6:32] put a difference between love for spouse
[6:34] and for family versus our love for God
[6:35] it should be infinitely more than love
[6:38] for anything else okay God first and our
[6:41] love for him is first and foremost
[6:43] brother brandham and uh God keeps his
[6:46] word don't tangle with the world or
[6:48] anything stat of this modern world stat
[6:49] of these modern theologies just look to
[6:51] the Lamb of God read your Bible and pray
[6:52] all the time that's so important and
[6:55] fall in love with
[6:57] Christ just skip on down to the
[6:59] highlighted point to save time this is
[7:00] again reviewing last the last lesson I
[7:03] have hid this Bible from the wise and PR
[7:05] and will reveal it to babes such as will
[7:07] believe if you want to get anything from
[7:09] God just be a baby open up the Bible
[7:12] fall in love with Jesus all these other
[7:14] things really come along in the journey
[7:16] but first and foremost fall in love with
[7:18] the
[7:21] Lord so uh identification brother B here
[7:24] talking about having the mind of Christ
[7:26] then uh we let his character be in us we
[7:29] have become Sons by having the mind of
[7:32] Christ mind which is his character your
[7:35] mind makes your character let the Mind
[7:38] Paul said of Christ this mind that was
[7:40] in Christ be in you let the mind of
[7:41] Christ be in you it molds the character
[7:43] of a Son of
[7:45] God all right so I'm going to skip this
[7:48] one I think I read this one last time
[7:49] gabrian I Reading This Love Dare
[7:51] book very very rich very good and I
[7:54] highly recommend getting that if y'all
[7:56] those of you who are married okay um
[7:57] it's a good good devotional for made
[7:59] couples to go through it's one for each
[8:01] day of the year um this one is titled
[8:04] love believes the best Bears all things
[8:08] believes all things hopes all things
[8:09] endures all things 1 Corinthians 13 this
[8:13] is keep in mind about your spouse but
[8:16] also about your love for the Lord this
[8:18] applies both ways deep in your heart is
[8:21] a room it's called the appreciation room
[8:24] it's where positive and encouraging
[8:26] thoughts about your spouse are kept or
[8:28] you could say about the Lord every so
[8:31] often you enjoy visiting this special
[8:33] place inside are wonderful things you've
[8:35] discovered about your mate and that
[8:37] cause your appreciation for them to
[8:39] increase down another Corridor of your
[8:42] heart lies the depreciation room and
[8:46] unfortunately you visit there as well
[8:47] inside are things that bother and
[8:49] irritate you about your spouse placed
[8:51] there out of frustration and
[8:52] disappointment but know this the more
[8:54] time you spend in this place the more
[8:57] your heart devalues your spouse in fact
[8:59] divorces are plotted here so stay out of
[9:03] that depreciation room kind of playing
[9:05] off brother John's series about finances
[9:07] you know Dave Ramsey teaches about debt
[9:10] scream and run don't play with debt when
[9:13] it comes knocking at your door and you
[9:14] get that credit card offer in the mail
[9:16] shred it throw it away don't sit there
[9:18] and put on the shelf and say I'll think
[9:19] about that I need a boat I need a car
[9:21] need this need that shred it throw it
[9:23] away scream from debt like avoid it like
[9:26] the plague he's very adamant about
[9:27] staying away from debt now take that
[9:30] into this depreciation room about your
[9:32] spouse or about the Lord scream and run
[9:35] when you have bad thoughts toward your
[9:37] spouse put him down just say you know
[9:40] what I love him her so much that I'm
[9:43] going to just apply Grace there I'm
[9:45] going to cover it over I'm going to say
[9:48] he or she is human you know and I'm
[9:50] going to just uh overcome that with love
[9:52] just overwhelming just layers and layers
[9:54] of love stay out of that depreciation
[9:56] room stay in the appreciation room
[10:00] and with God that means praise and
[10:02] worship that means thinking about all
[10:04] the good things he's given you and don't
[10:05] sit there and mle over you know well he
[10:08] let me go through this temptation or
[10:09] well he took this from me or that you
[10:11] know for at certain periods of our life
[10:13] we may Wonder just why Lord why' you let
[10:15] this happen but no he's got it in in his
[10:17] mind he knows what he's doing
[10:20] amen so skip on down where it says Love
[10:22] Knows about the depreciation room you
[10:25] know about it it's there you're you're
[10:27] aware that that it's that exists but it
[10:31] chooses not to live there love chooses
[10:33] to believe the best about people now
[10:36] we're including other people beside
[10:37] spouse now we're talking about one
[10:40] another love uh you know our brother and
[10:42] sisters in Christ and people we
[10:43] encounter even at on the job and so
[10:46] forth about people and when our worst
[10:48] hopes are proven to be true love makes
[10:51] every effort to deal with them and move
[10:53] forward as much as possible love focuses
[10:55] on the positive so pray to God to commit
[10:58] give him uh
[11:00] whatever issues you are worried about
[11:02] admit that you have no control over the
[11:04] issues and ask God for forgiveness for
[11:05] not trusting him resolve to turn any
[11:07] future worries into
[11:09] prayers and then uh Philippians 2 if
[11:13] there be therefore any consolation in
[11:15] Christ any comfort of love any
[11:16] Fellowship of the spirit any bowels and
[11:18] mercies fulfill you my fulfill you my
[11:20] joy that you may be like-minded having
[11:23] the same love being of one Accord of one
[11:25] mind let nothing be done through strive
[11:27] or vain Glory but in lowliness of mind
[11:29] let each esteem other better than than
[11:31] themselves that's that selfless uh
[11:34] aspect of Love look not every man on his
[11:36] own things but on every man also on the
[11:39] things of
[11:41] others so I'd say like this passion is
[11:44] blinding love is blinding love covers a
[11:47] multitude of sins so it really makes you
[11:49] blind to that depreciation room you're
[11:52] aware that it's there but you just
[11:54] Overlook
[11:55] it all those negative thoughts about God
[11:58] and about your situation or about your
[12:00] spouse um I read this kind of in depth
[12:04] last time I I'm still on review so I'm
[12:06] trying to just skip over some of this
[12:07] but let's keep on down Song of Solomon
[12:09] is a book about the romantic and
[12:10] sensuous love husband and wife should
[12:13] have for each other true sensuous love
[12:15] is a giving love not a taking love an
[12:17] offering of self rather than a claim to
[12:20] The spouse's self Ephesians 5 as the
[12:23] church submits to Christ so you wives
[12:25] should submit to your husbands and
[12:27] everything for the husbands this means
[12:28] to love your wives just as Christ loved
[12:31] the church he gave himself for her after
[12:34] our love for God nothing should take
[12:35] greater priority than giving the giving
[12:38] sacrificial love we have for our spouse
[12:40] this love helps us learn more about how
[12:42] we are to love God and in it's an
[12:45] example to those who are learning about
[12:47] love Hebrews
[12:49] 13 skip on down there to the Highlight
[12:52] part it's essential that you make a
[12:53] lifetime irrevocable commitment to stay
[12:56] married then when problems come you
[12:58] won't be looking for way out instead
[12:59] you'll be looking for a way
[13:02] through passion really in marriage will
[13:05] fix problems even if your spouse is not
[13:07] very passionate in return we'll say you
[13:10] just keep um that passionate love for
[13:13] them and you know and I guess you can
[13:15] say especially if you have like an
[13:16] unbelieving spouse that's the most
[13:18] difficult situation I can think of and
[13:20] that would be you know you just the the
[13:23] unbelieving wife is Sanctified by the
[13:25] husband or vice versa you know um just
[13:27] keep believing keep that that Sanctified
[13:29] life before them and keep being
[13:31] passionate in your love for them now
[13:33] this uh lesson is mostly inspired from
[13:36] this passage of scripture where the two
[13:38] are on the road to EMAs uh the disciples
[13:41] there and I don't need to read it all
[13:44] but as they drew not to AAS uh you know
[13:46] Jesus showed up as he often does when
[13:49] you think about him when you talk about
[13:51] him when you worship him he comes around
[13:53] that's his nature okay he loves to be
[13:55] worshiped thought about talked about you
[13:58] read word he comes around okay and
[14:02] here's where this heartburn condition
[14:04] comes in not natural heartburn I started
[14:06] to call this lesson heartburn and I was
[14:07] like no that don't seem quite right I'll
[14:09] call it passion so we're talking about
[14:11] passion the reason the disci the reason
[14:13] the Lord came to these disciples because
[14:15] was because of their passion for him
[14:16] because they cared they were not
[14:18] indifferent toward him they cared and
[14:21] they were thinking about him and really
[14:22] saddened by the fact that he was
[14:24] crucified and thought maybe he wasn't
[14:26] what he what they thought he was and
[14:28] then he came around and started to prove
[14:30] to them and and prove his life and
[14:32] Ministry and the uh Prophecies of the
[14:34] Old Testament and their heart began to
[14:36] burn and how many times has a minister
[14:38] stood up here and talked about things
[14:40] that you can um cope with that you've
[14:43] experienced that you've seen in the word
[14:45] and then your heart begins to burn and
[14:46] you have this passionate love that
[14:49] starts to starts to rise up in you and
[14:50] you say I believe that I know that I've
[14:52] seen that I've witnessed that I I can
[14:54] relate to that and that's what was
[14:57] happening here these disciples their
[14:58] heart Hearts begin to burn within them
[15:01] and that's what I'm basically talking
[15:03] about is this passion why wouldn't Jesus
[15:05] just come to two random people walk
[15:07] along the street who didn't care at all
[15:08] about about him or about religion at all
[15:12] why would he even appear to them and and
[15:14] start talking to them they wouldn't care
[15:15] you know they they might they might
[15:17] entertain him with just by listening for
[15:19] a moment and say I suppose that was
[15:21] pretty good and keep on going about
[15:23] whatever they were talking about but no
[15:25] he comes to those who are passionate
[15:27] about
[15:27] him for our God is a consuming fire read
[15:31] that down there in the red I'm not to
[15:32] read the whole passage here but my focus
[15:34] here on this scripture is God is a
[15:35] consuming fire when you really get into
[15:37] him he consumes you the the he
[15:40] sanctifies you he he burns out the
[15:42] sinful nature as you come to Christ as a
[15:45] sinner you give your heart to him you
[15:47] still have all that root of evil he
[15:49] comes and he burns that out through
[15:50] sanctifying you through the washing of
[15:52] Water by the word and he just be begins
[15:54] to consume your whole being everything
[15:56] about you begins to be consumed with him
[15:59] that's that
[16:01] passion signs of passion just to name a
[16:04] few this is not at all all inclusive
[16:07] it's just just a few of them that come
[16:08] to mind you will have an intense desire
[16:11] for more you will not let anything
[16:13] prevent you from obtaining more you will
[16:16] be blind to the negatives and you will
[16:19] be fully resolved Relentless Unstoppable
[16:22] this is something that from my own
[16:24] testimony when I was 12 I gave my heart
[16:25] to the Lord because I realized I was a
[16:27] sinner something happened frankly just
[16:29] to be blunt neighbor boy showed me
[16:31] pornography magazine until that time I
[16:33] thought I was pretty good A lot of my
[16:35] friends would say Ryan you're good you
[16:36] don't you don't go to the principal's
[16:37] office except for something good which
[16:39] was true at the time and I started
[16:41] thinking well I guess I'm all right
[16:43] started to believe him until that
[16:44] happened and then I began to realize I
[16:46] was a sinner like everybody else and I
[16:47] need salvation I came to Christ for
[16:49] salvation I repented my sins and I meant
[16:51] it and then this Burning passions like a
[16:54] little flame began burning in me that
[16:56] said I'm not going to stop serving
[16:58] Christ if I live to be 80 100 years old
[17:00] I will not stop it's there to this day
[17:03] and it's stronger than ever that's
[17:06] passion that's what I'm talking about
[17:07] being passionate let that start in you
[17:09] and burn like a fire passion shows in
[17:12] our actions you can't hide it I want to
[17:14] go to the Natural examples for a minute
[17:15] I'm passionate about flying and if you
[17:17] get around me and talk with me long
[17:19] enough you'll know that Aviation is my
[17:20] passion it's one of my passion so is
[17:23] learning instruments Gabby's is these
[17:26] crafts and baking cakes and art and
[17:29] those type of things so many of you have
[17:31] hobbies and things you do and if I get
[17:33] around you long enough your passion will
[17:35] kind of begin to come out and I and I'll
[17:36] begin to know what you're passionate
[17:38] about nothing wrong with those things
[17:40] just saying you can't hide your passion
[17:42] and if you're passionate about the Lord
[17:43] it'll show up sooner or later somewhere
[17:46] it'll come
[17:47] out
[17:51] so obviously the most the greatest
[17:54] example I can think of of passion is the
[17:57] example of Christ and and his passionate
[17:59] love for his bride uh and dying for us
[18:02] while we were yet sinners Christ died
[18:03] for us while we didn't even care at all
[18:05] about him cuz at some point in our lives
[18:07] each of us did not care about serving
[18:09] him at some point if you go back far
[18:11] enough another great example of passion
[18:14] is brother Dell he stands out in my mind
[18:16] as one of the greatest men that I know
[18:18] of being an example of passionate love
[18:20] for Christ for his bride for the word
[18:23] and as uh here on the left this is a
[18:25] picture of General Motors uh I just
[18:27] Googled you know from General Motors
[18:29] back in the 80s but this is an assembly
[18:32] line there and um you thank of brother
[18:34] Dell all those all those years that he
[18:36] commuted that long commute to work
[18:39] making a living for his family
[18:40] passionately serving his family while
[18:42] pastoring a church and and having all
[18:44] that passion for for uh pastoring of
[18:47] church and trying to get a sermon always
[18:49] fighting praying seeking God for his
[18:52] next sermon and listen to those two
[18:54] tapes a day and reading those six books
[18:55] a day sitting with brother collie I
[18:57] think in that office I think in part of
[18:59] that time reading those books studying
[19:01] there was no smartphones but I mean he
[19:04] could have busied himself with magazines
[19:06] or books or you know newspapers all kind
[19:09] of other things he could have kept his
[19:10] mind on but he stayed focused
[19:12] passionately on the word of God because
[19:14] he is passionate about it um and about
[19:17] serving his family and and raising them
[19:19] and everything he did was with passion I
[19:22] think I remember him saying this
[19:23] multiple times he said it's like a fire
[19:25] shut up in my bones you know it's this
[19:27] the message of the hour the word of God
[19:29] when you really get it it's like a fire
[19:31] shut up in you and it's just burning to
[19:33] get out it's burning to for you to
[19:35] understand more of it and to express it
[19:36] other people Jeremiah said there but his
[19:38] word was in my heart as a burning fire
[19:41] shut up in my bones and I was weary with
[19:43] forbearing I could not
[19:45] stay go back and read that whole passage
[19:47] you want to know but that's just what I
[19:49] was talking about burning a burning
[19:54] passion and then uh Matthew 5 blessed
[19:57] are they which hunger and thirst for
[19:58] righteousness for they shall be filled I
[20:00] believe brother Benham said you're even
[20:01] blessed even to have a hunger for it
[20:03] you're blessed if you even want more of
[20:05] God you're blessed so just stay right
[20:07] there just keep Desiring more of God
[20:09] it'll come and you'll keep seeking it
[20:10] because of it being a passion in you
[20:12] what drives you to seek more truth is
[20:14] that passion why do others H have the
[20:17] same opportunity but don't desire it why
[20:19] is that you know why don't some people
[20:21] have the passion like you have just
[20:24] think about that there's something
[20:25] burning in you for more of him examples
[20:28] of passion as I said we all go widows
[20:30] and widowers in our congregation
[20:31] ministers teachers musicians all have
[20:33] this passion for worshiping serving the
[20:35] lord and his bride um examples of
[20:39] passion also your alone time with the
[20:41] Lord okay what do you do for him in
[20:43] secret you know the things you do in
[20:45] secret for him are out of passion you
[20:48] know if you um do things up here like
[20:50] I'm doing you know teacher Sunday school
[20:51] right now you might say well you're just
[20:53] doing it cuz you're you know asked to
[20:55] teach Sunday school well what about when
[20:57] I go home and I go when nobody's looking
[21:00] and nobody sees and I do these little
[21:02] secret things of Love out of love for
[21:04] the Lord and y'all know what I'm talking
[21:05] about y'all do these things when you
[21:07] read your Bible and you enter in your
[21:08] prayer closet when no one sees you and
[21:10] you just cry and pray and seek God for
[21:12] Revelation or cry out for someone who's
[21:15] sick or or in need of Salvation that's
[21:18] passion um but thou when thou prayest
[21:21] enter thy closet and when thou has has
[21:22] shut thy door pray to thy father which
[21:24] is in secret and thy father which seeth
[21:26] in secret reward thee openly this is
[21:28] Brother Dell a quote from him from 2009
[21:32] uh 18 September 2018 on being born again
[21:35] message on brotherly kindness it says so
[21:38] in the spiritual children you've got to
[21:40] eat the word of God study the word of
[21:42] God you know pray and seek God ask him
[21:44] to reveal these things to you instead of
[21:46] just saying oh I believe that let it be
[21:48] a part of you and if you have that new
[21:50] birth you will desire right is that what
[21:52] we read you'll desire the sincere milk
[21:54] of the word that we may grow thereby
[21:56] because see that will be a part of your
[21:58] life
[22:00] passion why wouldn't you want to grow in
[22:03] Christ why would that not be your desire
[22:05] to want to know more about
[22:08] God really fall in love with the Lord
[22:10] first don't just say I believe this is
[22:12] just me saying this I'm not quoting
[22:13] anybody don't just say I believe but
[22:16] live I believe actions speak louder than
[22:18] words you can say you believe but
[22:20] missing Church neglecting Bible reading
[22:21] and prayer proves you don't really
[22:22] believe we prove What We Believe by our
[22:26] actions remember brother Bob's lesson on
[22:30] conscience and in other words if you
[22:33] don't read the Bible and the message you
[22:35] prove you don't believe it's necessary
[22:36] perhaps you believe you're all right
[22:38] just being in the message or in Spoken
[22:39] Word Church take heed to brother Dell's
[22:41] statement I'd rather seek the Holy Ghost
[22:43] every day of my life and find out that I
[22:45] had it all along and to not seek it and
[22:48] die lost more or less that I'm
[22:50] paraphrasing what he
[22:52] said
[22:54] so because thou sayest this is a message
[22:57] uh to the lat agent Revelation 3 because
[22:59] thou sayest I'm rich and increased in
[23:01] goods and have need of nothing and
[23:02] knowest not that thou retro miserable
[23:04] poor and blind and naked okay I'm not
[23:07] going to read all the scripture but the
[23:08] point is that that's the condition of
[23:10] our age to be miserable wretched blind
[23:12] and naked and think that we are you know
[23:15] rich and increase with goods and
[23:16] everything some people spend their life
[23:18] trying to figure out what love is other
[23:20] people spend their life trying to
[23:21] express their love humans are created to
[23:23] love driven by Love by the god of love
[23:26] when you possess it you want to express
[23:28] it
[23:30] um let's see I want to skip on down here
[23:33] to as the musicians will go ahead and
[23:35] come at this time and just got another
[23:36] minute or so
[23:39] here I think I quoted that before this
[23:42] is from Brother
[23:43] Wade let me go to yeah I think this one
[23:46] was first now look this is from um 2023
[23:50] last year September last year um now
[23:53] look it gave us the promises it didn't
[23:55] say we were going to automatically get
[23:58] them come on somebody come on somebody
[24:00] okay anyway they're there they're there
[24:02] to get but you got to want them You' got
[24:05] to get them make yourself ready whereby
[24:07] are giving unto us exceeding great and
[24:09] precious promises that by these brother
[24:11] B said these promises you might be
[24:13] Protectors of the divine nature
[24:15] wherefore the rather Breen give
[24:16] diligence to make your calling not your
[24:18] pastor not your brother not your sister
[24:19] or your neighbor your calling find out
[24:22] who you are and what you're doing here
[24:24] calling an election sure for if you do
[24:26] these things you'll never fall what
[24:28] promise if you do these things this
[24:29] formula brother B said this prescription
[24:32] you'll never
[24:33] fall and um I'm just going to skip to
[24:37] this as my last quote here Exposition
[24:38] from Seven Church ages brother bam on
[24:40] the Ephesian age the fervent desire to
[24:43] please God the passion to know his word
[24:45] the cry for reaching out in the spirit
[24:47] all begins to fade instead of that
[24:49] church being on fire with the fire of
[24:51] God it has cooled off and become a bit
[24:53] formal so bear those things in mind and
[24:56] pray God give me more passion help me
[24:58] more passionate about my service to you
[25:01] that's all thank you all God bless you
[25:04] [Applause]
