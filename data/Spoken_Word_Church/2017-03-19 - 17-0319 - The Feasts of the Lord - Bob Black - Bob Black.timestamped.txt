[0:02] All right, now we're
[0:06] live. So, we just read, for those
[0:09] watching in, we just read Leviticus
[0:11] chapter
[0:16] 23, which goes over the feast of the
[0:19] Lord that we'll talk about just briefly.
[0:21] I just want to kind of give an overview
[0:23] of of the feasts and why they're
[0:24] important. and and you know also point
[0:27] out that when you when you look at that
[0:29] chapter something like that then it it
[0:32] becomes apparent that that we need some
[0:34] help to understand the things that are
[0:36] written in the Bible. Yes. And a lot of
[0:39] times uh people people get in their
[0:41] minds that they kind of have a a simple
[0:44] conception of what the message is about
[0:46] and what the Bible's about and they
[0:47] begin to get in their minds that they
[0:49] can just figure it out on their own
[0:50] without any kind of help. Well, when you
[0:53] read something like that and when you
[0:55] begin to go deeper into God's word, it
[0:57] becomes apparent that you needed
[0:59] somebody to guide you along. That's
[1:00] right. And I believe that's uh you know
[1:03] uh Wednesday night we I I kind of read
[1:05] that or or quoted that scripture where
[1:06] it talks about Jesus passing out the
[1:09] loaves and the fishes to the disciples
[1:11] and then they pass it out to the the the
[1:13] food out to the people sitting there
[1:15] hungry. Because what the five-fold
[1:17] ministry, I believe, is is set to do is
[1:19] to take the great big old nuggets of the
[1:22] message. That's kind of hard to sink
[1:24] your teeth into. You bite down on it and
[1:26] it's like, you know, it's it's kind of
[1:28] hard unless you spend a whole lot of
[1:30] time studying and and praying and which,
[1:33] you know, sometimes, you know, going to
[1:36] jobs and things you just don't have time
[1:38] to do. So somebody that can can spend
[1:41] all that time doing the research for you
[1:44] so that you can get the benefit of it
[1:46] and and it helps break down the big
[1:48] chunk the big nugget of the message into
[1:51] easily digestible chunks. That's right.
[1:53] And so I hope that everybody and I'm I'm
[1:55] I'm pretty sure everybody here is in
[1:58] sync with that. But, you know, maybe if
[1:59] you're listening online that and you
[2:01] don't fully grasp the benefit of having
[2:04] somebody to teach you the
[2:06] word, God God uh sent people to as a
[2:10] help. It's it's helpful to have somebody
[2:12] to kind of walk you along. That's right.
[2:14] And um and and so you don't have to do
[2:16] it yourself. Because when you look at
[2:19] Leviticus 23 and and a lot of these a
[2:21] lot of these scriptures, it it is it
[2:23] seems like there's a lot of little
[2:25] things to all the different sacrifices,
[2:28] the different things that they're
[2:29] offering up and all of these things are
[2:31] speaking something that's really
[2:33] fantastic. If you can get a hold of it,
[2:36] if you can get if you can grab a hold of
[2:37] what it's speaking of, then it will
[2:39] build our faith.
[2:42] Now, that's the problem, right?
[2:43] Sometimes it's it seems like it's hard
[2:45] for us to just dive in and get a hold of
[2:47] what God is saying to us in this last
[2:49] day. And of course now people get in
[2:51] their minds that it's not important.
[2:53] It's too deep. It's too it's too
[2:56] complicated. Daniel 70 weeks, the feast
[2:59] of the trumpets, all the different
[3:00] feasts, all the different things that as
[3:02] you go up higher and higher, it becomes
[3:04] it seems like it's almost so hard. And
[3:07] and honestly, sometimes ministers do
[3:10] make it more complicated. Sometimes you
[3:12] maybe ministers are preaching from the
[3:14] book of Ephesians which is a little bit
[3:16] higher when when the people need maybe
[3:18] something out of the out of Corinthians
[3:20] something a little bit lower to try to
[3:22] go down because you know God came down
[3:25] he he came down to make it simple for us
[3:28] when when we were at that ministers
[3:29] meeting there was a brother from Africa
[3:30] speaking there really blessed me. He was
[3:32] talking about how over when you go
[3:34] overseas, the people in these little
[3:35] villages and stuff sometimes need it so
[3:38] simple that they just you can't go over
[3:40] there and and speak to them about um you
[3:42] know the thunders and everything just
[3:44] right off the bat. You got to go down
[3:46] and get way down to their level cuz they
[3:48] can't even they don't understand your
[3:50] language. They don't understand hardly.
[3:52] It's it's got to be real basic. And
[3:54] that's the way God did for us. Kate the
[3:56] great high almost unknowable
[3:59] unfathomable God came down to reveal to
[4:02] us the secrets of the word and
[4:04] simplicity in in stories like you know
[4:07] you you plant a seed in the ground a
[4:09] little mustard seed and it grows up and
[4:11] after a while you see the fruits little
[4:13] story little simple things that that
[4:15] tell great profound stories concepts
[4:19] about God but he did it in simplicity
[4:22] and that's the way the gospel should be
[4:23] preached
[4:25] So, so when you look at all these feast
[4:27] days, what they're really showing, and
[4:29] I'm I'm kind of going to take some time
[4:30] to just look at some quotes and just
[4:32] from a real high level, what's happening
[4:34] is is he's telling the story of what
[4:37] this first slide shows, the former and
[4:40] latter rain. First, there's got to be a
[4:42] planning, and then there's got to be a
[4:43] harvesting. Okay? That's why if you look
[4:45] at all these feasts, there's four of
[4:47] them in the in the in the springtime,
[4:50] the planning time, and three of them in
[4:52] the in the fall, the harvest time. And
[4:56] of course, you know, some say, well,
[4:58] there's also that eighth feast. Because
[5:00] if you look in Leviticus 23 at the very
[5:03] beginning, it it talks about as it
[5:05] begins to run through the seven feasts.
[5:07] Well, there's another one that it
[5:08] mentions that we just we celebrate every
[5:11] week or the Jews did and that was the
[5:13] Sabbath day, the day of rest, right? And
[5:15] of course, now we don't have a
[5:17] particular day. It that is is rest in
[5:20] Christ Jesus. Rest all the time. But but
[5:23] let's let's get our mind on that. The
[5:25] planning and the harvest because that
[5:27] planting and the harvest is a very
[5:29] simple thing that's repeated all through
[5:32] the feast and it's repeated in your
[5:34] life. First you got to hear the word.
[5:37] It's got to be planted that little
[5:38] mustard seed of faith and nothing mixes
[5:40] with and you hang on to it and after a
[5:44] while it bears fruit and and it grows up
[5:47] into a great big tree like like Jesus
[5:49] said. So, let's look at some of these
[5:51] scriptures and we'll just kind of take
[5:52] our time and not try to rush. So,
[5:56] Jeremiah 5:23-24 says, "But this
[5:59] people," I'm just kind of reading some
[6:00] some scriptures in the Old Testament
[6:02] where this thought of the former latter
[6:05] rain was mentioned. But this people hath
[6:08] a revoling and rebellious heart. They
[6:09] were revolted and going. Neither say
[6:12] they in their heart, "Let us now fear
[6:14] the Lord our God that giveth rain, both
[6:16] the former and the latter, in his
[6:18] season." He reserveth unto us the
[6:20] appointed weeks of the harvest. Of the
[6:23] harvest. That's what all these feasts
[6:24] are talking about. God's great harvest
[6:27] where he's trying to get a bride of
[6:29] people that that match the thought in
[6:33] heaven. Now, Jeremiah ain't talking
[6:36] about growing crops. He's comparing.
[6:39] He's trying to get people to see through
[6:40] the simplicity of the gospel that the
[6:42] gospel is just like something simple
[6:46] planting and growing the things that
[6:48] they're used to that the going out in
[6:50] the field and planting seeds and and
[6:52] going through all the all the different
[6:53] things you
[6:55] see in Hosea 6:13 and and this is the
[6:59] scripture that brother Dell's been
[7:00] quoting. Come and let us return unto the
[7:03] Lord for he hath sworn and he will heal
[7:05] us. He hath smitten and he will bind us
[7:07] up. Doesn't that sound like that
[7:08] scripture that Jesus read from in the
[7:09] book of Isaiah? Uh that he's come to
[7:12] declare that the the the day of the
[7:14] acceptable day of the Lord to bind up
[7:16] all those things. After two days will he
[7:19] revive us. In the third day he will
[7:21] raise us up and we shall live in his
[7:24] sight. Then shall we know if we fall on
[7:27] to know the Lord is going forth as
[7:28] prepared as the morning. And she he
[7:30] shall come unto us as the rain as the
[7:32] latter and former rain unto the earth
[7:35] because that's how he comes. He plants
[7:37] and then he harvests. You put the seed
[7:39] in the ground and then the latter rain
[7:42] comes to show you what you got. You got
[7:44] a planting and then well there's what
[7:46] was planted. And that's so important
[7:49] because what's planted is what's going
[7:50] to come up. If if you plant false
[7:53] doctrine, then you're not going to have
[7:54] a a a true birth. That's right. That's
[7:57] why hearing the word is so important,
[7:59] right? And and we're, you know, we're
[8:01] born by the word. We're not born by by
[8:03] dos and don'ts and things. We're not
[8:05] born so many times. You know, I think
[8:06] ministers will almost stand in the door
[8:09] and and put so many rules and
[8:10] regulations that you have to follow and
[8:12] they'll stand in the door not even
[8:14] keeping those own rules and regulations
[8:16] making put heaping burdens upon people.
[8:18] That's right. When when the gospel
[8:20] should be uh that it's not dos and
[8:22] don'ts, but it's a life of Christ lived
[8:24] in you. Amen. To to perform the word.
[8:27] So, you heap you heap all these burdens
[8:29] upon people and that's that's not the
[8:31] goal. That's not the objective. That's
[8:33] not the mystery that was revealed to the
[8:35] Gentiles that was hidden and all those
[8:37] things that Colossians 1:26-27 talks
[8:39] about. It's not just just uh wearing the
[8:42] right clothes and doing the right thing,
[8:44] but it's the word of word of God being
[8:46] born in you and being man manifested in
[8:48] your life.
[8:51] In a resume of the ages, brother said
[8:54] this age started just after the turn of
[8:56] the 20th century and it was to be the
[8:58] age in which the true church would
[8:59] return to being the bride she was at
[9:01] Pentecost. We know that there must of
[9:04] necessity be a return of dynamic power.
[9:07] Now, why what does this have to do with
[9:09] the former and latter reign? In the
[9:11] latter reign, there's there's got to be
[9:13] a planting and there's got to be a
[9:14] harvest where at the end times, you see
[9:17] the return back to the original seed.
[9:20] The believer sensed this in their
[9:21] spirits and began crying to God for a
[9:23] new outpouring such as was in the first
[9:25] century. What seemed to be the answer
[9:27] came as many began to speak in tongues
[9:29] and manifest gifts of the spirit. It was
[9:31] then believed that this was indeed the
[9:33] long awaited restoration. It was not for
[9:36] the latter rain can come only after the
[9:38] former rain which is the spring or
[9:40] teaching rain. The latter rain then is
[9:42] the harvest
[9:44] rain. That sounds very
[9:46] technical. Wonder why we have to know
[9:48] all this kind of stuff because it's the
[9:51] simplicity of the gospel that it's the
[9:53] simplicity of the gospel by which you're
[9:55] born again by hearing the word. and and
[9:58] you know that that goes over so many
[10:00] people's hands cuz you're not born again
[10:03] by by sensations and things. You're not
[10:05] born again by uh screaming and crying
[10:07] and everything. You're born again by a
[10:09] revelation of God's word. You're not
[10:11] even born again because of of of of
[10:14] doing the right thing or whatever by by
[10:16] having the right clothes and the right
[10:18] dress and everything. But it's the word
[10:20] of God being made manifest in you. Amen.
[10:27] He said in Jehovah Gyro we've had a
[10:30] revival. We fuss so much about latter
[10:33] rain. Had movements called latter rain,
[10:35] latter rain, former rain, inner rain,
[10:37] outer rain. I was reading the other day.
[10:39] Do you know what former rain means in
[10:41] the Hebrew word? I can't call it right
[10:42] now. I never wrote it down and skipped
[10:44] my mind. But former former rain, the
[10:46] first rain means a rain of teaching. The
[10:48] second rain is the spirit that comes
[10:50] upon what's been taught and produces the
[10:52] crop.
[10:54] to skip on down. While the church ought
[10:56] to be on fire for God right now, if
[10:59] there had been a word seed swed back
[11:01] there and there would be signs, wonders,
[11:04] miracles, and that church will be
[11:05] together, one heart, one accord, and
[11:07] marching toward Zion for the rapture.
[11:09] What did we
[11:10] do? We had intellectual speeches instead
[11:13] of the word. We had reasoning against
[11:16] the word and everything else.
[11:19] And I know these are things that that
[11:21] many of us know and we're familiar with,
[11:23] but it's good sometimes to just get a
[11:25] little refreshing or reminder what the
[11:27] focus is and what and and what these
[11:29] feasts are all about. The focus of it is
[11:32] is is there's something that had to go
[11:34] down in the ground, right? Something had
[11:36] to in your life, you had to die to your
[11:38] own self. That's right. So that so that
[11:40] the word of God could be born, right?
[11:42] And so these first four these first four
[11:44] uh feasts are talking about something
[11:47] going down something planning something
[11:49] something being planned and then the
[11:51] last three something's raised up and
[11:53] it's time for the combine to come and
[11:55] get that harvest harvest the the word
[11:57] that has be coming to
[12:04] fruition in in uh in 1955 said in the
[12:09] beginning when Pentecost fell it fell on
[12:11] the Jews
[12:12] and the Jewish church died out and the
[12:14] gentile church come in and then all
[12:16] signs and wonders ceased. Now notice
[12:18] that was the former reign. Then the
[12:20] church the Jewish church is returning
[12:22] just in the latter rain when the Holy
[12:24] Spirit is just being poured out
[12:27] again. See how there's so many ways that
[12:30] you can look at a former and latter rain
[12:32] because even in those first four feasts
[12:34] there's a there's a planting. Christ was
[12:36] planted and then the on the day of
[12:38] Pentecost there was the harvest and
[12:40] everything just kind of boom boom boom
[12:42] like that. The first four feasts of the
[12:44] planting of where the church and Christ
[12:46] were planted and then the last three the
[12:47] harvest and everything just kind of
[12:49] moves like that planning the harvest.
[12:52] The spoken word is the original seed. He
[12:53] said someone asked me to repeat that
[12:55] word again in Joel the second chapter
[12:57] Joel 2:28 where he's speaking of the
[12:59] coming of the former and latter rain.
[13:01] The word former is the Hebrew word m o u
[13:04] r e h mo which means teaching. In other
[13:09] words, it'll be a teaching rain and a
[13:11] harvest rain. Now, we've had the
[13:12] teaching rain and we're ready now for
[13:14] the harvest train. You know, the first
[13:16] strain is when you plant the seed that
[13:18] starts your crop growing. Then, just
[13:20] before it matures, there comes another
[13:23] crop. That's what they call a harvest
[13:25] drain. We know what it is. The spring
[13:26] rains and then the rains about June. It
[13:29] makes your crop. Now the rain we find
[13:32] out was the
[13:33] spirit and the rain falls on the just
[13:36] and the unjust. And what's going to come
[13:38] up is what was planted. So if what goes
[13:41] if what was planted was false was
[13:43] corruptible then what's going to come up
[13:45] is not going to be what it should be.
[13:48] That's right.
[13:51] In the believer's position in Christ, he
[13:53] said God's got a time for all things.
[13:55] He's got a time that he has we plant
[13:56] corn. We got a time that we plow corn
[13:58] and at the time we harvest corn. The
[14:00] spring rains come, the drought through
[14:03] the summer, the fall rains, the snows.
[14:06] You just can't say, I'll plant my wheat
[14:07] today and tomorrow and go out and
[14:09] harvest it. Now, let's look at that
[14:10] quote right there because he said the
[14:12] spring rain comes and then there's a
[14:14] drought, some some dry period through
[14:16] the summer and then the fall rains. And
[14:19] that's just the way that the feast days
[14:20] are arranged. I don't know if you can
[14:22] see that, but you got the first four
[14:24] feasts. And then you got uh I believe
[14:26] it's about 3 months right in between
[14:28] there. And then four months after after
[14:31] the uh the the month that the Pentecost
[14:34] occurs in, you've got everything kind of
[14:36] kicking back up again. So you got spring
[14:39] and then a little a little period in the
[14:41] middle there and then
[14:46] fall. You got it.
[14:52] Let me go on to the next one. My slides
[14:55] not
[14:57] working. There we
[14:59] go. Former and latter rain or I mean a
[15:03] resume of the ages. Brother said he is
[15:05] doing as stated in verse 23 by the
[15:07] teaching or former reign. Next will come
[15:09] the harvest rain or rapturing
[15:13] faith. And the spoken word is original
[15:15] seed. He said now what seeds was
[15:17] planted? You cannot get nothing else
[15:18] from it but what seeds that was planted.
[15:21] Can you understand now? It'll be the
[15:22] seeds that's planted. Now the spirit
[15:25] will fall but it'll bring a harvest of
[15:27] the seed that it falls on. Mhm.
[15:32] That and then Paul talking about
[15:34] planting and watering the polished
[15:35] water. Neither is he that planteth
[15:36] anything neither he that waterth but God
[15:38] that giveth an increase.
[15:43] and the signs of his coming. Brother
[15:44] said that's how we have eternal life
[15:46] because we have we was spoken into
[15:48] existence by God not joined into a
[15:50] church but born by the word the original
[15:52] seed that God said let there be and
[15:54] there was that's the way God borns his
[15:57] children today in the womb of their
[15:58] heart with his word and his word takes
[16:01] root and grows right
[16:06] and then there's I put in that quote
[16:08] where brother Ram he was preaching away
[16:10] the first summer he ever preached and
[16:11] his and his pastor came out and told him
[16:13] that was was the rottenest sermon I ever
[16:15] heard. And he said, "Brother Davis,
[16:17] everybody's crying and everything." And
[16:19] he said, "Sure, they cry at funerals and
[16:20] and and births and everything else, but
[16:22] it but it's the word that makes alive.
[16:24] The word quicken, not experiences the
[16:26] word." That's right.
[16:31] So, that's what we're trying to do as
[16:32] ministers is sew the word, plant the
[16:34] word in the ground so that it can it can
[16:36] come forth.
[16:38] That's really I I believe my my personal
[16:40] revelation is the vindication of any
[16:42] minister's ministry is that is that the
[16:44] word is the word's going to be planted
[16:46] and come forth, right? If nothing or in
[16:48] other words, something's going to happen
[16:49] if it's if if you preach away and nobody
[16:52] gets born again, nobody has a change in
[16:54] their life. Well, that's maybe something
[16:56] to be concerned about. But as people get
[16:59] inspired and everything, that's the
[17:00] vindication that the word's going forth
[17:01] and something's happening. That's true.
[17:04] John 12:23-24 he said and Jesus answered
[17:07] them saying the hour has come that the
[17:09] Son of man should be glorified verily
[17:11] verily I say unto you except a corn of
[17:13] wheat fall into the ground and die it
[17:15] abideth alone but if it die it bringeth
[17:18] forth much fruit so here we're getting
[17:20] into the those first four feasts because
[17:22] a corn of wheat that's what a corn wheat
[17:25] looks like it had to go down in the
[17:26] ground and be planted it's got to it's
[17:28] got to die and we know that that also
[17:30] types the new birth experience all that
[17:32] outside shell has die and rot away so
[17:34] that life can come forth in the corn in
[17:36] the in from the from the seed. But of
[17:39] course, this plan we're talking about is
[17:40] that that Jesus Christ had to die and be
[17:42] planted in the ground. He was planted
[17:44] down in the ground. And as we were
[17:46] talking about Wednesday night, he broke
[17:47] free from the dust and came up and broke
[17:49] free from the from the shackles of the
[17:51] earth as that stone was rolled
[17:55] away. and and then to to kind of fulfill
[18:00] this whole week of all the uh or this
[18:03] whole first part of all the different
[18:04] feasts which kind of happened all all
[18:06] together there. And I put a chart it
[18:08] helps me to kind of see things visually.
[18:10] So that's I spent a lot of time putting
[18:12] these little charts together so I can
[18:13] get everything kind of arranged in my
[18:14] mind. But look, you got on Nissan 10. If
[18:18] you go back to Leviticus 23 and Exodus
[18:20] 12, I believe it's Jesus came into the
[18:22] into Jerusalem on Nissan 10 wrote in uh
[18:26] because on Nissan 10 it says it says
[18:28] begin preparing the lamb. Get take the
[18:30] lamb and start preparing it. Make sure
[18:33] that it's blemish free. Make sure it's
[18:35] all good. And then and and all these
[18:38] feasts, the first four feasts coincide
[18:40] exactly with what happened with Jesus's
[18:42] the planting of of Jesus Christ, the
[18:45] planting of the church, the harvesting
[18:48] of the church, showing up the first
[18:49] fruits on the on the day of Pentecost,
[18:51] rising from the ground or rising from
[18:53] from death to life on the on the on the
[18:55] day of Pentecost after Jesus had been
[18:57] had been buried. and and we'll go
[18:59] through one of the these one at a time
[19:00] and we got 10 minutes left. But um so
[19:04] you can see everything just kind of fits
[19:06] together and and u I hadn't quite got
[19:10] this. I got a few little extra
[19:11] information in here like how brother
[19:13] Rand talked about that the feast of
[19:14] unleven breads coincides with the seven
[19:16] church ages and different
[19:18] things. So there's a lot of information
[19:20] there. And then going on into the feast
[19:22] of Pentecost where they offer the two
[19:24] load wave loads of two tenth deals. Uh
[19:28] put them on fire, burn them on the day
[19:30] of Pentecost. And you got the 50 and the
[19:32] eight coming
[19:34] together. So the harvest thing is the
[19:36] day of Pentecost.
[19:39] So Joel 2:23:29 says, "Be glad then you
[19:43] children of Israel and rejoice in the
[19:44] Lord your God, for he hath given you the
[19:46] former rain moderately, and he will
[19:47] cause to come down to you the rain and
[19:49] the former rain and the latter rain and
[19:51] the first month." And that's when we we
[19:53] know these this these these first four
[19:55] feasts are in the first month. In in the
[19:58] book of Exodus, it says, "Let this be
[20:00] the first month to you." When they when
[20:01] they uh take the Passover, the first
[20:04] month is when that barley harvest
[20:05] begins. it begins to ripen that that in
[20:08] Nissan they they actually started the
[20:10] month of Nissan on the on the day of the
[20:12] when the barley harvest uh was was
[20:15] coming to ripen and it says and the
[20:18] floor shall be full of wheat and the fat
[20:20] shall overflow with wine and oil that
[20:23] it's all these things speaking of what
[20:25] happened in that first month the the the
[20:28] word that life has been given to the
[20:30] church so that the they're just
[20:32] overflowing with wine and oil and I will
[20:35] restore to you when you read these
[20:37] scriptures, it's it's almost
[20:38] interesting. It can be a little
[20:40] confusing how it's speaking of different
[20:41] things at the same time. Now, we almost
[20:44] jump over to I will res to the end
[20:46] times. I will restore to you the years
[20:48] that the locust hath eaten, the
[20:50] cankerorm and the caterer and the
[20:52] pommeorm and so on. Then jump down to
[20:54] verse 28. And it shall come to pass
[20:56] afterward that I will pour out my spirit
[20:57] upon all flesh. And that's the scripture
[21:00] that Peter quoted on the day of
[21:01] Pentecost. They will pour out my spirit
[21:04] on all flesh. But this is speaking of
[21:06] the of the of the former and latter of
[21:08] the harvest days of the feast days that
[21:10] we're looking
[21:12] at. In Romans 6:45, it says, "For if we
[21:15] have been planted together in the
[21:16] likeness of his death, we shall also be
[21:19] be in the likeness of his resurrection."
[21:23] So the feast of Pentecost, let's look at
[21:25] that real quick. These are the feasts of
[21:27] the Lord. Leviticus 23:4-5 says, "Even
[21:29] even holy convocations which he shall
[21:32] proclaim in their seasons and the 14th
[21:34] day of the first month that even is the
[21:37] Lord's Passover." And we looked at that
[21:39] chart how they they they had to get that
[21:41] u that lamb prepared on Nissan 10, get
[21:44] it ready all the way down to Nissan
[21:46] 14th. They would sacrifice that lamb on
[21:48] Nissan 14th. And remember in the in the
[21:50] Old Testament, the the Bible times the
[21:53] the evening from evening to evening is a
[21:56] day. So in the evening he sacrifice the
[21:58] lamb and it goes right on to the next
[22:00] day which is the beginning of the feast
[22:01] of unleven bread. So it goes right on in
[22:05] which why a lot of times in the Bible
[22:06] they would refer to the Passover as as
[22:08] as the feast of unleven bread because it
[22:10] just moves right on in. There's not
[22:13] there's not like a break between the
[22:15] feast of unleven bread and the Passover.
[22:21] So, the feast of Pentecost in Exodus
[22:23] 12:3 involves all these things that
[22:25] speak of what Christ did and their
[22:27] liberation from Egypt. I'm sorry y'all
[22:31] can't see that. I'm just y'all just have
[22:33] to listen.
[22:35] [Music]
[22:36] The first thing was that uh they they
[22:38] took every house had their own lamb. So,
[22:41] Exodus 12:3 it says speak and you can if
[22:44] you have a Bible you can read along with
[22:45] me. Exodus 12:3 says, "Speak ye unto all
[22:48] the congregation of Israel, saying, in
[22:50] the 10th day of this month, they shall
[22:51] take to them every man a lamb." There's
[22:54] the 10th day. Get it ready. Just as
[22:56] Jesus wrote into
[22:57] Jerusalem, decided according to the
[22:59] house of their fathers, a lamb for an
[23:01] house. Every house had to have a lamb.
[23:03] This kind of corresponds to Joshua over
[23:05] there in the Old Testament saying, "As
[23:07] for me, and my house, we will serve the
[23:08] Lord." Get that token applied to your
[23:11] own house. Now, now there's something
[23:13] interesting because, you know, we we we
[23:15] don't preach dos and don'ts so much, but
[23:17] as when it comes to your own house, as
[23:19] for me, in my house, we're going to
[23:20] serve the Lord. You know, I expect my my
[23:22] daughters and my kids to d to dress and
[23:24] and and do the right thing because you
[23:26] you apply the token to your own home.
[23:28] You apply the faith to your own home.
[23:30] And as long as you're in my house,
[23:32] abiding in in my house under my rules
[23:33] and everything, then you have a set of
[23:35] rules and things that you have to live
[23:36] by. Even if you don't have the new
[23:38] birth, right? Because the token is
[23:40] applied to my home. and and there's some
[23:42] expectations that go along with that. Uh
[23:45] remember Billy Paul started going out
[23:46] and gambling everything and brother Ren
[23:48] said, "I'm sorry. You can't live under
[23:50] my roof no more." Because he had uh he
[23:53] had a special calling in his life. You
[23:55] uh and and it that just wouldn't work
[23:56] out right. You're applying the token to
[23:59] your home. In Exodus 12:5, it says,
[24:02] "Your lamb shall be without blemish, a
[24:04] male of the first year, just like Jesus
[24:06] was without blemish. And he had to be
[24:08] inspected. He had to be tried by the
[24:10] devil. all those different things just
[24:11] like a true believer has to be has to go
[24:13] through the inspection time and trial by
[24:15] fire. Let me see if there's anything
[24:16] wrong with you. Like the right after the
[24:18] river Jordan, uh the the de he went into
[24:21] the wilderness and the devil was tempted
[24:22] him and everything and all along the
[24:24] like Pilate said, "I find no fault in
[24:26] you." That's right. Inspect inspection
[24:29] time. He had to be inspected. He was
[24:30] found to be without blemish. And I got
[24:33] Oh, oh goodness. I'm trying to hurry.
[24:36] Exodus 12:6. and he shall keep it up
[24:38] until the 14th day of the same month.
[24:41] And the whole assembly of the
[24:42] congregation of Israel shall kill it in
[24:44] the evening. The whole assembly,
[24:46] everybody. And that's that's what
[24:47] happened to all the Israelites, they
[24:49] they killed Jesus. They because their
[24:51] eyes were blind and they didn't see who
[24:53] he really was. And the whole assembly
[24:55] put him up on the cross. The whole
[24:57] assembly of the congregation of Israel
[24:59] shall kill it in the evening. And they
[25:01] shall take of the blood and strike it on
[25:02] the two side post on the upper door post
[25:04] of the houses wherein they shall eat it.
[25:07] Put that blood over the lint of your
[25:09] door. And if the blood ain't there, if
[25:11] the blood can't be seen, in other words,
[25:13] the life of Christ is visible inside of
[25:16] you because you can you can talk a lot.
[25:19] You can you can say a lot of things, but
[25:21] if the if the life is not visible,
[25:23] right? And we know that the revelation
[25:26] produces a life, right? uh you you can
[25:28] have a lot of intellectual understanding
[25:29] or whatever but if it if the life the
[25:31] blood is the life of Christ the life in
[25:34] you visible made manifest right and if
[25:38] the life is not visible then you have no
[25:40] confidence that the death angels will
[25:42] pass. Exodus 12:8 says, "And they shall
[25:44] eat the flesh in that night," which we
[25:46] know is a type of that that communion
[25:48] bread we eat, the he said, "I am the
[25:50] bread of life that came down from
[25:52] heaven." And they had to eat every
[25:53] little bit. And whatever they didn't
[25:55] eat, they burned before the before the
[25:57] next morning. Right? They shall eat the
[25:59] flesh in that night roast with fire and
[26:02] unleaven bread carry right on into the
[26:04] feast of unleaven bread and with bitter
[26:07] herbs they shall eat it eat not of it
[26:09] raw nor soden at all with water but
[26:12] roast with fire his head with his legs
[26:15] and with the pertinence thereof the all
[26:17] the insides every roast it all and eat
[26:19] it all up and anything that's left over
[26:21] you got to burn before the morning and
[26:22] that's a type of how we're supposed to
[26:24] be eating a whole Bible we're not
[26:26] supposed to be picking and choosing
[26:27] right we're supposed to eat all of the
[26:29] word that's been given to us, every last
[26:31] bit. Exodus 12:10, "And ye shall let
[26:34] nothing of it remain until the morning."
[26:36] And Exodus 12:11 says, "And thus shall
[26:38] ye eat it with your loins girded, your
[26:40] shoes on your feet, and your staff in
[26:42] your hand." Because in the Exodus, they
[26:45] were getting ready to be delivered from
[26:46] slavery. They were getting ready to be
[26:48] delivered from bondage. They were going
[26:49] to be liberated. And just in this day,
[26:52] you you're you're moving. Don't stop.
[26:55] Don't don't eat it. eat a little bit and
[26:57] then then get all tired and everything
[26:59] and just and and and cabbage down, but
[27:02] just keep moving on cuz like brother
[27:04] Wayade's been bringing out, the end of
[27:06] the journey is the evidence that
[27:08] everything was all right from beginning
[27:09] with just keep moving on. Exodus 12:12,
[27:13] for I will pass through the land of
[27:15] Egypt this night, and will smite all the
[27:18] firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man
[27:20] and beast, and against all the gods of
[27:22] Egypt, I will execute judgment. So he
[27:24] was our sacrifice to deliver us from
[27:26] bondage. And Exodus 12:13 says, "And the
[27:28] blood shall be to you for a token upon
[27:30] the houses where you are. And when I see
[27:32] the blood, I will pass over you and the
[27:34] plague shall not be upon you." Now
[27:37] remember sometimes we get our in our
[27:39] head and I'll stop right here that the
[27:41] token is just about the new birth. But
[27:43] the token also in this last day is
[27:46] something visible that God can see so
[27:48] that you can take a body change. the
[27:50] token. He said, "How could how could you
[27:51] have full obedience to the word?" When
[27:53] he preached the token after the seals
[27:54] were open, how could you have full
[27:56] obedience to the word, full obedience to
[27:58] all the word entitles you to the token?
[28:00] And in this last day, we've had all of
[28:03] the word open so that the full life of
[28:05] Christ could be made manifest in the
[28:07] church. The son of man revealed again in
[28:09] flesh. And then when he sees that death
[28:12] of the flesh, you won't face death
[28:15] because you don't go in the rapture.
[28:17] Right. All right. Amen. Thank you very
[28:20] much.
[28:25] [Music]
