[2:03] amen good afternoon Sister Mary you got
[2:06] it says I have something to say in a
[2:08] short video
[2:27] like this
[2:36] I'm sorry
[2:39] if that's what you
[2:43] um praise God for some reason I had
[2:45] forgotten about this I'm so sorry
[2:47] um there's a video I wanted you all to
[2:49] see
[2:50] um yesterday
[2:52] for some reason I was just sitting at
[2:54] home and
[2:55] um I'm trying to
[2:58] train myself like literally every day
[3:01] read the Bible pray learn something
[3:05] about brother Branham or one of his
[3:07] sermons because somebody like me we grew
[3:09] up in the message but we didn't know
[3:11] what was going on or I remember the
[3:13] first time I found out about Adam and
[3:15] Eve my older sister is the one who was
[3:17] like we were in Kenya she's like oh they
[3:19] you know they didn't really eat an apple
[3:21] and I'm like okay so
[3:25] um for me I'm having to play catch up on
[3:27] some things but as a young person I
[3:30] always tell people
[3:32] um I always want to I want to be an
[3:35] example but not a bad example because
[3:37] I'm not perfect but at the same time I
[3:39] know what it is to have children and
[3:41] raise them in this world
[3:44] um so
[3:46] I started watching this YouTube video
[3:50] uh while I was
[3:53] um in my room and um
[3:56] some I I wish I can play the video maybe
[3:59] next time but somehow
[4:01] brother Brown I'm just blurted out he
[4:03] was praying and he said and there's a
[4:06] sister laying down who has issues with
[4:10] the surgery didn't go well
[4:12] something about the doctors they're not
[4:16] really good at what they do I mean he
[4:19] and I'm just sitting there froze and I
[4:22] had to keep replaying it just to make
[4:24] sure I'm hearing the right thing
[4:25] and he didn't stop there he kept going
[4:28] and saying she's very frustrated and she
[4:31] has mental issues or something like that
[4:34] because of the military I'm like what
[4:38] I didn't know how to explain that I
[4:40] don't know what it is
[4:42] um
[4:43] so I sent the video to my mom and my
[4:45] family and stuff like that and they were
[4:47] like yeah so apparently he's my older
[4:49] sister told me he's healed people like
[4:51] that before I didn't know
[4:53] but um
[4:55] I've just never done anything like that
[4:57] like on us you know Saturday evening
[5:00] like I'm watching so to me he spoke to
[5:04] me somehow I don't know how because I'm
[5:08] the kind of person I want to see I guess
[5:10] maybe because of being in the military I
[5:11] want to see like right there
[5:13] you know and if I'm going to do
[5:15] something I'm not going to do it halfway
[5:18] I don't know how to do two things at the
[5:20] same time it has to be one way so for a
[5:22] very long time I've always said
[5:25] um
[5:26] if I was to ever die before let's hope
[5:28] now God will somehow consider me but I
[5:31] always used to tell my family look I
[5:33] already know where I'm going if I died
[5:35] right now because I'm doing the opposite
[5:37] of what that man said
[5:39] and even if I was today and go to hell I
[5:41] will tell him the same thing there's
[5:43] nobody else here
[5:45] so because the devil is really bad and
[5:48] I used to have really bad nightmares
[5:50] like he would come to my room and I
[5:51] would see this man right there you know
[5:54] so he's he's tormented me so much to the
[5:58] point where somehow it worked to my
[6:00] favor because
[6:01] it got to a point where um when he would
[6:04] come to my room I just kick him off the
[6:06] bed and I'm like yo wait how why are you
[6:07] waking me up at three o'clock in the
[6:09] morning you know like that's how that's
[6:11] how it got but most people think like
[6:13] the devil is just oh he's a tale no he's
[6:17] literally a normal human being
[6:20] very good looking at everything so I
[6:22] have seen it experienced all that so
[6:24] going through all that gave me the
[6:27] assurance that Mary you've gone through
[6:29] all this and you still want to live in
[6:31] the you know you know what the truth you
[6:34] still want to live in the you know you
[6:36] know what the truth is these people like
[6:38] you who are going to and I was okay with
[6:41] it
[6:43] so once I started saying that he stopped
[6:46] coming
[6:48] but guess what he's back now
[6:51] like now that I'm trying to do
[6:53] everything right
[6:55] I can literally feel him to the point
[6:57] where some of my caregivers tell me I'm
[7:00] seeing something moving around I don't
[7:02] know what it is I'm like just pray I
[7:04] don't know how else to help you because
[7:06] for me he won't um come at me during the
[7:09] day he's a coward he'll only do it when
[7:11] I'm sleeping
[7:13] you know because he knows my mind is not
[7:15] there or something like that so
[7:18] um but I'm not scared of that puppet um
[7:20] but other than that that's what I wanted
[7:23] to say I think y'all
[7:29] oh man we got a few requests remember
[7:32] the one from this morning A lot of
[7:33] people are traveling we mentioned them

[7:41] those two so Charlotte gave me one says

[7:46] having trouble with her high blood
[7:48] pressure so our member says to Gail
[7:49] still remember me and all the other ones
[7:51] that are going through that situation

[9:23] good afternoon
[9:24] I just wanted to share with you guys
[9:27] um what Wade was preaching on this
[9:29] morning
[9:31] about the pawn shop
[9:33] share with you my pawn shop
[9:36] testimony in my journey
[9:39] you all know that when you can pick up
[9:41] bits and pieces from my life I was
[9:42] straight up laodicea
[9:44] this particular time straight up
[9:47] laodicea good job I live right across
[9:50] the street from the job I was able to
[9:51] walk there and that was the one that it
[9:54] was called The Institute of living in
[9:55] Hartford Connecticut
[9:57] a little history on that place it used
[9:59] to be called the Harford Retreat where
[10:02] all the movie stars would go to dry out
[10:05] but when I got there it was only two
[10:08] that I knew of Sammy Davis Jr had
[10:10] someone there and Phil Donahue
[10:13] I worked as the Director of social
[10:16] activities that's the rehabilitation
[10:19] department and we would have meetings
[10:21] every morning
[10:22] and after we took care of matters at
[10:25] hand during coffee and donut time all of
[10:27] a sudden I just blurted out
[10:29] I'm moving to Atlanta
[10:32] now y'all know prior to that I didn't
[10:34] know the Lord my mother honored the Lord
[10:36] by Sunday Sabbath we couldn't do
[10:39] anything that's all I knew I didn't pray
[10:41] I didn't pay no ties nowhere I wasn't
[10:44] going to church I would go to a Baptist
[10:46] Church to please my grandmother just to
[10:48] make a smile on her face but that's all
[10:50] I knew and then I blurt that out at the
[10:53] meeting
[10:54] and then within a few months I was down

[34:14] Kinsmen Redeemer as we were talking
[34:16] about this morning the pawn shop
[34:17] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[34:19] Among Us we behold his glory the glory
[34:22] the only begotten of the father
[34:24] full of grace and truth let's go to
[34:25] first second Peter 1.
[34:27] verse 5.
[34:29] and excuse me if I continue reading on
[34:32] some of you want to read in your Bible
[34:33] I'll hesitate a moment
[34:36] I think we're kind of lazy a lot of sins
[34:37] we just read what's on the screen so and
[34:39] I do the same thing and besides this
[34:42] besides what besides all that we talked
[34:45] about this morning besides all that pawn
[34:47] shop where we come in and come out in in
[34:49] Redemption and and paying the ransom and
[34:52] and you know doing the right thing and
[34:54] and getting the new birth besides that
[34:58] without that you're out of the pawn shop
[35:00] now what are you gonna do you gonna just
[35:02] lay there
[35:03] nope and besides this giving all
[35:05] diligence wow diligence
[35:08] add to your faith version the virtual
[35:10] knowledge
[35:11] to knowledge temperance
[35:13] we'll get to that today to Temperance
[35:16] patience and patience godliness
[35:18] Luke 21 verse 19 says in your patience
[35:21] in your patience
[35:23] possess ye
[35:25] you're very Saul
[35:28] in your patience
[35:30] possess ye
[35:31] very Soul you may be seated Lord has
[35:34] blessing that's the problem we have in
[35:36] the end time
[35:37] we are not patient people
[35:41] will
[35:42] absolutely run you off the road just to
[35:45] get the next be the next person in line
[35:46] to stop at the traffic light
[35:49] I love traffic lights it's a great
[35:51] equalizer
[35:53] our stop signs
[35:55] right somebody fly by you and they'll
[35:58] pass you and and you know half a mile
[35:59] down the road they're sitting in front
[36:01] of a red light and you just pull right
[36:02] up behind them and you
[36:05] you wasted Gas Buddy
[36:09] but patience
[36:10] in your patience
[36:13] possess ye
[36:14] your soul
[36:16] wow that's pretty tough
[36:18] but let's talk about knowledge and
[36:20] Temperance first before we get to
[36:21] patience
[36:23] because there's a lot of temperance
[36:24] going on when somebody passes you and
[36:26] you don't like it right you give them
[36:27] the old you know left or right hand of
[36:29] Fellowship
[36:31] yeah
[36:32] so let's go back to the chart
[36:35] excuse me I got a little tick on my
[36:37] throat
[36:38] I might have been hollering too much
[36:40] this morning
[36:41] also I was hollering too much this
[36:43] morning you said amen
[36:45] okay
[36:46] stop you have to be careful what you
[36:47] amen
[36:49] you say old me can somebody say Oh Me Oh
[36:52] Me
[36:53] okay
[36:55] but we were in that pawn shop listen buy
[36:57] our Birth by our first birth we got put
[37:00] in that pawn shop
[37:02] we were not supposed to be born that way
[37:04] but we were born in sin shaping and
[37:06] iniquity a spouse from my mother's womb
[37:08] a liar doomed and on our way to Hell our
[37:12] soul is what's going to go to hell
[37:15] your body's not going to hell per se
[37:17] your body's gonna follow
[37:19] but
[37:21] Jesus told him he said don't worry about
[37:23] the guy that can kill your body don't
[37:25] worry about the guy in other words it
[37:27] can can cut your head off he said you
[37:29] barely worry about the one that can kill
[37:31] your soul there's only one person that
[37:32] can kill us all and that's the Lord
[37:34] Jesus our God Almighty and he's the only
[37:37] one that can kill us all he made it so
[37:39] he can kill it all right you and I can't
[37:41] do away with one we can you know Satan
[37:43] can do what he wants to he can take us
[37:45] out of this dimension
[37:47] fleshly but we step right over into
[37:49] another dimension and there we are just
[37:52] as Eternal as God is in another
[37:54] dimension hidden away from Satan Satan
[37:56] can't find us he I don't think Satan
[37:58] even knows where that sixth Dimension is
[38:00] god holds that for up for the people
[38:02] that are passed on Lord so that they can
[38:04] be what happy and so that they can say
[38:06] hey
[38:07] I made it
[38:09] but then remember they're not complete
[38:10] though they got to come back here and
[38:12] get their human body they know they're
[38:13] not humans you were human here you're
[38:15] going to be a human there all right
[38:18] Supernatural human but you're going to
[38:20] be a human so your soul is what the
[38:22] whole deal is so if you want if you want
[38:25] the Lord Jesus to save your soul then
[38:27] there's where that the pawn shop you got
[38:30] put in you got to believe that somebody
[38:33] went to that pawn shop paid the price
[38:35] took you out and remember what I said
[38:37] this morning never have to pay that
[38:40] again
[38:41] you never have to go back and say well I
[38:44] think I'll pay you no it was paid once
[38:46] for all
[38:48] simple salvation is he paid the price
[38:51] once for all that's our problem which
[38:52] like I said before he everything gets
[38:54] thrown into seeing God's forgetfulness
[38:56] and we just pull it right back out
[38:58] it's gone out of his mind he doesn't
[39:00] remember it no more listen if God
[39:02] remembers your sin you're in trouble
[39:05] if God remembers your sin you're a
[39:07] sinner
[39:07] if you're not
[39:10] if you're born again Christian
[39:12] he cannot listen that's where the
[39:14] Judgment party is that's why if you'll
[39:16] get this Simple Plan of Salvation it's
[39:18] just so neat how that God can do that
[39:20] that he can take and clean your soul out
[39:23] your soul be just as Eternal as God is
[39:25] but the rest of you be completely dying
[39:29] like this this thing dying and your
[39:31] spirit realm that's where Satan is going
[39:33] to be digging at you from the time from
[39:34] here to the time you get out of here one
[39:36] way or the other right
[39:38] because it can't bother your soul he
[39:39] can't get in there unclean spirit's gone
[39:42] out of that thing and it will not get
[39:43] back in if it's full of the Holy Ghost
[39:45] all right like I said today this morning
[39:47] that there's that pawn shop that's
[39:49] taking you the person what is the person
[39:51] is this your person no brother Brown
[39:53] said you don't see the real William
[39:54] Brenner
[39:57] you don't see the real Donnie far bush
[39:59] the real 95 bush is inside that
[40:01] now what he displays or he
[40:06] um manifest what's inside of him he's
[40:09] only four Bush he was born to
[40:11] um
[40:12] Hazel and Tom fabush all right all right
[40:16] Had a Brain burp there for a minute yeah
[40:19] but that that's where the natural part
[40:21] you can see came from
[40:23] but the soul come from God
[40:25] so come from God whether he's born again
[40:27] or not
[40:29] so the soul comes from God that's the
[40:31] real person it came from God now what
[40:34] happens is you come down here the
[40:35] prophet even tells us you come down here
[40:37] to make your choice to make your
[40:39] decision is right here
[40:42] now he saw you make it before the
[40:44] foundation of the world and he
[40:46] predestinated because he predetermined
[40:49] what he saw he didn't predetermine what
[40:51] he wanted
[40:53] come on he didn't predetermine what he
[40:55] wanted because he wanted all to be saved
[40:58] and everybody's not going to be saved
[41:00] but he saw who would and who wouldn't he
[41:02] saw who would say God get me out of this
[41:04] pawn shop
[41:05] and I don't want to ever go back to that
[41:07] place again and there are places you've
[41:09] been in your life that you never
[41:11] for a million dollars you wouldn't go
[41:13] back to that same spot again I've got
[41:16] about 10 or 12 of it might be a
[41:17] multi-millionaire if I did that
[41:19] a man I never go back to that place
[41:22] because I know what happened right right
[41:24] you know what happened you're the only
[41:26] one that knows what happened but God
[41:28] doesn't even know it now
[41:30] if you're born again forget about it you
[41:33] can't forget about it but you can soften
[41:35] it a lot
[41:36] by saying God you told me
[41:38] in your Bible that if I believe on you
[41:41] you'll put every bit of my sin in the
[41:44] sea of God's forgetfulness never to be
[41:46] remembered again
[41:49] that's why Jesus stood up to those
[41:51] Pharisees and he said
[41:53] you used to have a way out
[41:56] you had a cloak for your problems and
[41:58] your issues and your sin but now you
[42:02] don't
[42:02] the word has been presented to you the
[42:05] way it's supposed to be in the Old
[42:06] Testament in flesh I'm here now I'm the
[42:10] most the Messiah
[42:11] I am the son of God
[42:14] son of man
[42:16] whatever title you want to give him back
[42:18] and forth but they knew when he started
[42:20] speaking that if you'll watch that
[42:22] um series called chosen
[42:25] when he talks about the son of man you
[42:27] watch them two Pharisees
[42:30] why they always wear black
[42:32] always got on black like there's some
[42:34] dark they are dark Spirits coming in
[42:38] he called himself the son of man they
[42:40] knew what he was talking about like
[42:42] brother Bob was talking about they knew
[42:44] what happened in the garden
[42:47] it's by fornication that they were well
[42:49] look at them they knew they came wrong
[42:53] so they'd have to teach them about an
[42:55] apple
[42:56] that's why they stood one day I said
[42:57] we'd be not born a fornication like you
[42:59] are
[43:00] but he wasn't born a foreign occasion he
[43:02] was born born by God
[43:04] amen
[43:06] he knew who his daddy was do we do we
[43:10] know who our father our progener is not
[43:14] your dad sitting there in you know seven
[43:16] rows from here
[43:17] your heavenly father
[43:19] that's why we have to deny you can't put
[43:22] away your first bird but you can deny
[43:24] that that's what's going to shape you
[43:28] come on deny that oh I'm this way
[43:31] because my daddy was this way
[43:34] well you know what I'm this way because
[43:36] what my daddy is too
[43:38] hey man
[43:40] I'm just waiting because my daddy made
[43:43] me this way my real dad made me this way
[43:46] I got good characters for my daddy but I
[43:49] got some bad ones
[43:51] Paul everybody gets quiet
[43:55] what was that question we asked at the
[43:57] banquet
[43:58] that brought a lot of contention because
[44:00] I asked him sister and I said does your
[44:02] husband act more like his mama or his
[44:04] daddy Oh Lord You're the same name looks
[44:07] at each other especially when one would
[44:08] say Mom another one would say Daddy
[44:13] and I am so glad that I was the
[44:14] moderator
[44:17] you see it's being the moderator I don't
[44:19] have to I don't have to you know list
[44:20] all this
[44:24] you've never seen looks like you see
[44:26] when you see them people look at each
[44:27] other like they know this is his they
[44:30] know my wife's gonna say this and
[44:31] they'll stay blue and she'll say pink
[44:35] especially those new ones I don't need
[44:37] people we kind of know each other I
[44:39] could answer every one of them questions
[44:40] for most of y'all but some of the new
[44:42] people you know you kind of they kind of
[44:43] look at each other that one couple they
[44:46] needed a lot of work
[44:49] all the way back to Dallas they should
[44:51] have been talking about some stuff
[44:55] yeah
[44:56] but listen do you know of your heavenly
[44:58] father that way
[45:05] I know who my daddy is
[45:07] yes
[45:10] I hope we act like our daddy
[45:14] you say well we have sure we have
[45:15] problems well we listen we got that one
[45:18] spot of humanity
[45:20] because we were born
[45:21] through a womb
[45:23] all right this is that one spot you're
[45:25] not gonna get rid of
[45:27] everybody with me about that size right
[45:28] there
[45:29] brother mom said this thing will be
[45:31] sticky to those chains you've got that
[45:32] one Sticky Thing
[45:34] which you know in your mind how you got
[45:37] here
[45:41] if y'all didn't you need to go talk to
[45:43] you
[45:44] find out what happened but you know how
[45:47] you got here and there's no denying that
[45:50] from what I see standing here or sitting
[45:52] here
[45:53] but inside of us it's not another person
[45:56] oh sure it's the person of Jesus Christ
[45:58] but you are a unit so that unit when the
[46:01] soul is changed then it starts working
[46:04] to the spirit realm and then we display
[46:06] it with this this is still gonna look
[46:08] like Samuel and Peggy Dale
[46:10] but inside of me you gotta realize
[46:13] there's an 18 year old person
[46:16] it looks just like you did when he was
[46:18] 18 years old but that's the way God did
[46:21] he put this one to this one and this one
[46:23] to this one to get you here
[46:25] he put a genetic brother Aaron he's all
[46:28] into this genetic stuff one day he's
[46:30] gonna find out he come from somewhere he
[46:31] maybe didn't want to
[46:33] Elvis Presley maybe I don't know
[46:36] but yeah okay all right I shouldn't have
[46:39] said that I apologize
[46:40] but you know genealogies are good but
[46:44] what can you do about it number one
[46:47] and what are you gonna do about it
[46:49] number two
[46:52] I don't care who I came from I came from
[46:55] God and I'm going back to God
[46:58] if you've got
[47:01] you literally you came from God
[47:04] to God
[47:08] he took a picture you brother Ron said
[47:10] before the foundation of the world
[47:12] what a photographer
[47:14] I bet it was an HD too I bet it wasn't
[47:16] no camera roll
[47:18] I wasn't you know that flash stuff no it
[47:21] was high definition because he knows
[47:23] exactly your character you know why
[47:24] because he did he took this one and this
[47:26] one this one to this one this one to
[47:28] this one this one or this one to get you
[47:29] here
[47:30] in the personality you're supposed to be
[47:33] and the features you're supposed to be
[47:34] What a Mighty God that has you control
[47:38] this whole thing
[47:41] we have a party and sure by our choices
[47:43] but he's he's going to have somebody
[47:46] that's gonna look like him
[47:50] praise the Lord
[47:52] to our soul
[47:55] there's the foundation there's the whole
[47:57] thing if we get that right to begin with
[47:59] then we can start on the building we can
[48:01] get the foundation right we can get
[48:04] started to do this next part in add
[48:08] to your New Birth
[48:11] add to the real you
[48:17] what does that mean to minister just
[48:20] what we're doing now
[48:22] listen
[48:24] if you've not grown
[48:26] if you're a Christian and you haven't
[48:27] grown I'd go back and figure out whether
[48:30] I was a Christian or not
[48:35] listen things are going to bother us
[48:37] always
[48:39] you need to cover the weak part that you
[48:42] were before you got born again
[48:45] and know what brother Brown said he said
[48:46] Satan knows your weakness and he said
[48:48] you better throw that fly that you
[48:49] better throw that Shield up well you
[48:51] keep it there
[48:53] keep it up there and just keep doing
[48:55] keep putting the shield of what faith
[48:57] believing that God's going to take care
[49:00] of you but you got to get behind it
[49:01] remember what Eve's problem was brother
[49:03] Brown said eve came around
[49:06] and got in front
[49:08] and that's what our problem is we want
[49:09] to help God
[49:12] not have a lot of patience definitely
[49:14] not have a lot of temperance
[49:16] but your soul
[49:18] it's the real you so that's the real
[49:20] person that we've been trying to deal
[49:22] with for six months and still get I'm
[49:25] still coming back to it because we got
[49:27] to know that we're born again before we
[49:29] can add
[49:31] Paul Peter knew he was born again he
[49:34] knew on the day of Pentecost he stood up
[49:36] and said this is that
[49:38] this is that Joy says I pour out my
[49:41] spirit upon All Flesh I was thinking
[49:43] about that just a few minutes ago
[49:45] brother border somebody sent me the clip
[49:47] for the Ashbury that Revival they're
[49:50] having
[49:51] that could be the outpouring of the Holy
[49:53] Ghost
[49:55] but that could just be anointing ones
[49:56] too
[49:58] right because they don't know what
[49:59] they're shouting about and did Brother
[50:00] Brown say they shout but they don't know
[50:01] what they're shouting about they can say
[50:03] Jesus Jesus and not get anything they
[50:05] get an outpouring of the Holy Ghost you
[50:07] know why I call this outpouring I
[50:08] believe on us
[50:10] and with us it's going on down it's
[50:12] digging a deeper well it's going to our
[50:14] soul
[50:15] because we have the right teaching we
[50:18] know what the right word is we know what
[50:20] God does to our soul it's not just a
[50:22] well you know I'm I'm a Christian today
[50:24] and I'm not tomorrow and I'm up here and
[50:25] I'm down here
[50:28] hey somewhere folks you're gonna have to
[50:30] put a nail down or a big old State and
[50:31] say this is it
[50:33] this is it
[50:38] Minister nourishment
[50:40] I never will get finished with this to
[50:43] supply
[50:44] to be supplied so add
[50:47] what's an adjective in a in a if you get
[50:50] gasoline Donnie's already told us that
[50:53] that there's really only a couple of
[50:55] types of oil they may be castor oil
[50:58] Valvoline and all those different brands
[51:01] but there's only just a few because what
[51:02] they do is they put a different label on
[51:04] it and send it out
[51:05] right brother
[51:08] valvoline's about the most cleanest and
[51:10] the best one he knows because he's in
[51:12] the industry same way with microwave
[51:15] they put LG on about five or six of them
[51:18] they put GE on the five or six of them
[51:19] they slap this on it's the same
[51:21] identical thing
[51:23] that's the devil
[51:27] God will let us know
[51:29] what we need we just got to know where
[51:32] to get it at right which would be in the
[51:34] fivefold Ministries which is I believe
[51:36] the only way for us to get out of here
[51:38] but I will
[51:48] Rich our own ideas is what eats the word
[51:50] of God down
[51:51] all right
[51:52] then brother Brian give us the the
[51:55] vision
[51:56] and and I like what somebody said the
[51:58] other day
[51:59] we were talking about something and we
[52:01] can talk about this Visions are great
[52:04] our invasion is great it's great to hear
[52:06] brother I'm talking about a vision
[52:08] I was looking and I saw
[52:10] a bride
[52:12] or I was looking and I saw the red the
[52:15] green check his shirt
[52:17] right my brother best school was that he
[52:19] was going hunting he was going to kill
[52:20] this caribou and this grizzly bear he
[52:23] said that was a young man his young hand
[52:26] he saw him in division
[52:28] but he saw a green check his shirt right
[52:30] that's just to me to me it's just
[52:32] wonderful to listen to those
[52:34] but it don't mean deadly squat to me
[52:38] if I'm not in division
[52:41] it's wonderful to tell the story of
[52:45] it but I gotta be in it
[52:47] if not I'm left out
[52:51] but I am in division he saw
[52:53] and I don't care if I'm that bride that
[52:55] got out of Step he said she got back in
[52:57] line
[52:59] she'll get out of step with that word if
[53:01] I don't watch
[53:03] when she's passing by she gets by
[53:05] maybe it'll be my time when I'm over see
[53:08] when I'm finished or whatever
[53:09] and we're getting back trying their best
[53:12] wait a minute what
[53:16] they were trying their best to get back
[53:19] in line
[53:22] try your best to get back in line
[53:27] just get in line
[53:29] they were looking what were they looking
[53:31] at they wasn't looking at the Garden
[53:33] right here they were looking what's
[53:35] going on out gender what's going on out
[53:37] in the political world what's going on
[53:38] over here in this place and what's going
[53:40] on in this church and what's going on
[53:43] not watching where you walk in yourself
[53:46] what they were looking somewhere else
[53:48] watching about that church listen you
[53:52] start looking at that church out there
[53:54] you are going to get out of step in this
[53:56] line of the Bride
[54:00] but two the front one's never the back
[54:03] ones
[54:04] two or three of them
[54:06] was kind of step out a little bit to the
[54:08] right hand side
[54:09] looked like I was trying to get back in
[54:10] line as they went by they just passed me
[54:13] old fires here to there to the wall
[54:15] remember what he said at the at the end
[54:18] of the real Vision he was telling he
[54:19] said he said he woke up saying get back
[54:22] in line or get back in Step well that's
[54:25] the message
[54:26] that's the message we got now get back
[54:29] in line get back in step with God
[54:32] but this Bride Comes in view twice God
[54:34] loves us so much he there's a bride show
[54:36] in here and then he's going to show up
[54:38] right in the end time even though she
[54:39] might be a little bit out of Step she's
[54:42] going to get back in line because she is
[54:44] b-r-i-d-e she is bride
[54:47] she is not Church she's bright she's the
[54:50] wife of Jesus Christ
[54:53] she will get back in line
[54:58] seed fell on the ground and I see it
[55:00] that was the original sea
[55:01] she came to the what the process
[55:04] of these denominations which only comes
[55:06] in existence once but the bride returns
[55:08] back again in the last day I will
[55:09] restore
[55:10] that's the reason she was in view
[55:12] reviewed the second time
[55:14] she was reviewed the first time through
[55:16] the first three Church ages
[55:18] she was perfectly second time like she
[55:20] was the first time oh God have mercy
[55:22] hurry hurry life get in the grain white
[55:24] brother Brown say that
[55:26] because his message was grain message
[55:29] his message was coming up through
[55:31] justifications thank you baptism the
[55:33] Holy Ghost but he said it was the four
[55:34] life Messengers last one was the word
[55:36] the last one it's not a stalk
[55:39] it's not a tassel
[55:41] it's not a shock
[55:43] it's the very seed that went in the
[55:44] ground
[55:46] and that's why we're feeding on now
[55:48] we're feeding on the grain we're not
[55:50] feeding on the stalk
[55:53] amen the spot won't grow itself back the
[55:55] seed will
[55:57] the same word of God we listen to every
[55:59] Wednesday night every Sunday every time
[56:01] we press play every time we talk about
[56:03] the word of God there's got to be
[56:05] something a reaction
[56:07] don't fall behind
[56:13] this is a living word this is not oh
[56:15] yeah
[56:16] sometimes it looks like dry bones
[56:21] sometimes you're really low like Dropbox
[56:24] but it looks like dry bones
[56:27] but remember that Army came to life
[56:29] right
[56:30] l-i-f-e that Army came to life
[56:35] by what by the word by the fourth
[56:37] message that came today this living
[56:41] message this word of God this we're
[56:43] looking at today you're sitting in the
[56:46] right place today
[56:50] not the seat you're sitting in you're
[56:53] sitting in the right place in the word
[56:54] of God
[56:57] listen Luther got a part no doubt he's
[57:01] well known all over the world
[57:04] Wesley all over the world Methodist
[57:08] there's a method of religion there's a
[57:10] method of worship and God said I'll take
[57:12] that right now
[57:14] but let's move on
[57:15] then you got the Pentecostals which come
[57:17] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost they
[57:19] got gifts in the church
[57:21] they had Happy Times They had wonderful
[57:23] time speaking in tongues God prophesying
[57:25] talking to to people through people
[57:30] but the last of it remember brother
[57:31] round talks about being you know the
[57:33] water coming up to here and the Bible
[57:35] tells us the water keeps coming up and
[57:37] then he tells us he goes on and tells us
[57:38] he talks about the neck he said but once
[57:41] you get in the intelligence there are no
[57:43] more moving parts
[57:47] from here up there's no moving Parts but
[57:49] now what's going on now some of you may
[57:51] have an issue with this
[57:54] there's something going on about my eyes
[57:57] I told you
[57:59] easy
[58:01] from here up there's something going on
[58:03] right now
[58:04] I'm assessing so are you
[58:06] well some of you are not
[58:08] but you're processing listen
[58:11] milliseconds you're processing thousands
[58:13] and hundreds of thousands of memories
[58:16] because when I make a quote what do you
[58:18] do you say I heard that Sunday I heard
[58:20] that last week I heard that on a tape I
[58:22] know what he's talking about it's just
[58:24] like this
[58:25] so there you know what this is what I'm
[58:27] telling you there's no moving Parts look
[58:29] this is moving Parts this is the
[58:31] Pentecost but when it comes to the
[58:33] intelligence the knowledge of God you
[58:36] can't see me I can be standing just like
[58:38] this
[58:39] and have a revelation is just that's why
[58:42] you've got your temperature is 98.6
[58:45] well something may be a little lower
[58:47] because of volume but not you buddy
[58:54] but that's why your your temperature
[58:56] kits that's why you have a temperature
[58:58] your body's firing
[59:01] it's a fire mechanism it's working it's
[59:03] going it's that's why I'm sweating right
[59:04] now because it's going but I'm doing
[59:06] this but from here up
[59:08] nobody sees it working but you
[59:11] and nobody sees it working but God
[59:14] sees that you're thinking about him
[59:16] instead of having to work on how to work
[59:18] on a tractor or what Walmart's got on
[59:20] sale tomorrow
[59:21] 's Monday all they all be healed so
[59:23] you'll be fine
[59:30] all you sisters are going to that play
[59:32] tomorrow
[59:35] you've sat there three hours and watch
[59:37] that show
[59:41] never bad an eye
[59:43] I'm going somewhere with this
[59:45] never bad an eye you're gonna be there
[59:47] 30 minutes early and you're gonna stay
[59:49] there the whole time
[59:50] are you gonna watch that show because
[59:52] that's what you like
[59:54] why can't you do that sitting here
[59:58] oh I know you don't like me that's okay
[1:00:00] but I'm trying to save your soul I don't
[1:00:01] care about your feelings I really do not
[1:00:03] I care about your soul I want your soul
[1:00:06] saved
[1:00:07] but I want you to realize
[1:00:09] it is you God's watching you not
[1:00:16] it's strange how they you can't come to
[1:00:18] church on Sunday but I look on Facebook
[1:00:20] on Monday and you you've got an airplane
[1:00:23] and flew four four hours to for a trip
[1:00:25] that week
[1:00:27] I'm preaching now
[1:00:40] but in the last day of Malachi 4 I'm
[1:00:43] telling you the truth I'm not trying to
[1:00:44] tell you I'm not trying to upset you but
[1:00:46] I hope it does
[1:00:49] how you gonna get listen some of us get
[1:00:51] it no I don't say us
[1:00:53] some of y'all get it just I mean like
[1:00:58] some of us is like
[1:01:00] ah
[1:01:01] I don't want that
[1:01:03] but then the Lord said yeah you need
[1:01:05] that
[1:01:06] then you want you go
[1:01:10] swallow that
[1:01:14] and say Lord I know he hates me and I
[1:01:17] mean he loves me
[1:01:19] but he hates sin brother they'll look
[1:01:21] brother you know brother I love y'all he
[1:01:23] still does I don't say love but when he
[1:01:24] was up here just firing away but he'd
[1:01:26] say some things that that sometimes you
[1:01:28] go wow
[1:01:31] it's like he thought brother Claude said
[1:01:32] he said I was listening to your watch
[1:01:34] your daddy the other day and said I just
[1:01:35] know I heard heads hitting the ground
[1:01:38] I know they were rolling down that
[1:01:40] center aisle
[1:01:42] but it was done with love he's trying to
[1:01:44] save your soul not worrying about the
[1:01:46] rest of you
[1:01:49] because look if he can save that thing
[1:01:52] right there
[1:01:53] and brodell can't save you you know that
[1:01:55] but he can get you to a point to where
[1:01:57] he can put you in contact with that guy
[1:02:01] nothing between my soul and my savior
[1:02:04] there's no excuse
[1:02:06] that we'll ever have
[1:02:08] basically in this church
[1:02:11] that you can't get your soul saved We're
[1:02:13] not gonna sit here and tell you that
[1:02:15] that Soul was fine it was good when you
[1:02:17] was a baby God was already in there
[1:02:19] don't worry about it you were saved for
[1:02:22] the foundation World well yeah you are
[1:02:23] the mind to God but not in that same
[1:02:25] thing you're sitting in
[1:02:28] I'm gonna say something else
[1:02:30] a sorry thing you're sitting in but we
[1:02:32] all special sorry people we come from a
[1:02:35] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil okay
[1:02:39] four Killers took it look they weren't
[1:02:41] nice
[1:02:43] they ate that tree down they had a
[1:02:45] purpose
[1:02:46] to eat the word of God down so that it
[1:02:49] would have no effect
[1:02:51] but thank God
[1:02:53] prophesy son of man
[1:02:56] can't these bones live
[1:02:58] yes they can
[1:03:00] because there's creative power in the
[1:03:02] word of God there's creative power and
[1:03:04] speaking the word of God
[1:03:07] can these bones live once the four
[1:03:09] stages come forth of the church watch
[1:03:10] the four stages of Ezekiel dry bones but
[1:03:12] the life only come not when the sinew
[1:03:15] skin was on them but when the wind
[1:03:17] blowed upon them that's when come back
[1:03:19] that fourth message of Life Jesus stood
[1:03:21] one day and told the disciples he said
[1:03:23] receive ye the Holy Ghost now they
[1:03:25] didn't receive it then that was a
[1:03:27] potential that was a that was saying
[1:03:29] you're going to receive it on the day of
[1:03:30] Pentecost he didn't get he couldn't give
[1:03:32] him the new birth he couldn't give them
[1:03:33] the Holy Ghost before he died
[1:03:34] the man is everybody with me on that
[1:03:36] brother Brown said potentially
[1:03:39] they had the opportunity to receive that
[1:03:42] Breath of Life
[1:03:44] listen Jesus's natural breath can't save
[1:03:47] you
[1:03:50] it's just breath
[1:03:52] he wasn't talking about that
[1:03:54] he's talking about that part that was
[1:03:55] inside of him
[1:03:57] he said I'm going to make your dry bones
[1:03:58] I'm gonna make them breathe
[1:04:00] and it's going to be the breath of
[1:04:02] eternal life not the Breath of Life
[1:04:07] all right the four states was a word
[1:04:08] let's keep on going we got to get we got
[1:04:10] to get somewhere
[1:04:13] program talks about what's the time when
[1:04:15] the sons of gods ever do manifest today
[1:04:21] listen and we can't manifest if you're
[1:04:22] manifesting you're not get any joy in
[1:04:25] your life and you're not getting any
[1:04:26] anything going on with God as far as
[1:04:28] reading and studying getting Revelation
[1:04:30] and and really loving to do what God
[1:04:33] Said
[1:04:34] go back to the bottom
[1:04:37] and let's start over again
[1:04:42] nature is waiting on us as we are
[1:04:44] praying
[1:04:46] Lord there's what 30 000 people died
[1:04:49] in that one earthquake
[1:04:51] was it that turkey
[1:04:54] thousand people one earthquake
[1:04:56] seven point something
[1:04:58] that's going to be a pimple to what's
[1:05:01] going to happen in California
[1:05:03] millions are going to die in just a few
[1:05:06] seconds
[1:05:07] much less more as the day keeps going on
[1:05:09] and they can't get to them
[1:05:11] and they're in their buildings and
[1:05:12] they're under the ocean drowning why
[1:05:14] because they turned the word of God down
[1:05:16] there won't be a bride in that part
[1:05:21] was there a bride in Jerusalem
[1:05:25] not when Titus and you know why they did
[1:05:29] what the word said
[1:05:31] Jesus told them get out of here when you
[1:05:33] see that get out of this city there
[1:05:35] wasn't a Believer inside that city right
[1:05:38] you get caught in the city worry about
[1:05:40] your belief
[1:05:44] spirit of God coming into these men so
[1:05:46] perfectly until their ministry will be
[1:05:48] so close like constantly join him and
[1:05:50] his church together
[1:05:52] listen you could be hated if you tell
[1:05:54] the truth
[1:05:55] you're gonna be hated
[1:05:57] people gonna hate you the Bible says
[1:05:59] have I become your enemy why
[1:06:01] because I've told you the truth
[1:06:03] because people Satan hates truth he does
[1:06:05] not like it he hates truth
[1:06:10] all right besides just giving all
[1:06:12] diligence add to your faith virtue and
[1:06:14] to Virtue knowledge now here with
[1:06:15] knowledge we've been talking about
[1:06:16] knowledge but I want you to understand
[1:06:18] something about knowledge this knowledge
[1:06:20] is not knowledge to get you through
[1:06:22] school
[1:06:23] okay high school college
[1:06:26] all right now you can put that two
[1:06:28] together and use Holy Ghost knowledge if
[1:06:30] you'll put him first
[1:06:32] then your knowledge you know brother
[1:06:34] Brown said he said he said take the
[1:06:36] kitties and and get around the table and
[1:06:39] if it says one of them said Dad I'm
[1:06:41] having a test today

[1:07:37] to use that because you're a human
[1:07:40] let me put it this way God's not going
[1:07:41] to take the test for you
[1:07:43] but he's going to give you the knowledge
[1:07:45] to remember what you
[1:07:47] learned in school or learned that that
[1:07:49] was the whole thing with me I listened
[1:07:51] to the teachers a lot of people they
[1:07:53] just sit there and you know shots pit
[1:07:54] wads and throw paper airplanes after one
[1:07:56] didn't you know talk about their
[1:07:58] girlfriend or was worried about what
[1:08:00] they was going to do after school I
[1:08:01] listen and I didn't have to take a book
[1:08:02] home I didn't make a beetle I got to
[1:08:04] college that's a fact
[1:08:07] I can't say that about the other two in
[1:08:08] this family but
[1:08:10] happened to me
[1:08:13] but what did I do though it brought my
[1:08:15] brain brought back what I had learned
[1:08:19] same thing with the gospel
[1:08:21] Holy Ghost knowledge will do what it'll
[1:08:24] bring things to what the Bible says to
[1:08:26] your remembrance whatsoever in other
[1:08:29] words whatsoever you heard not something
[1:08:30] you didn't hear
[1:08:35] you can't get a revelation
[1:08:37] of something you don't know just a
[1:08:39] little bit about
[1:08:40] you got to know a little bit about it
[1:08:42] before you get a revelation and you
[1:08:44] might have with the wrong interpretation
[1:08:46] but God will turn that thing and say no
[1:08:48] this is it remember brother Bradham
[1:08:50] brother Branham he all thought that the
[1:08:53] new birth was just love
[1:08:55] remember it's what he said he taught
[1:08:57] that the new birth was just love love
[1:08:58] everybody he said the angel corrected me
[1:09:01] on that
[1:09:03] see we may not have an angel come in our
[1:09:05] bedroom but we got preachers coming on
[1:09:06] Sundays and Wednesdays with an Angel
[1:09:09] that's going to tell you that your
[1:09:11] Revelation is a little bit off
[1:09:13] Brother Brad was going to preach that
[1:09:14] the white horse rider what's the holy
[1:09:16] ghost ever he said that right
[1:09:18] he said if the angel hadn't come in the
[1:09:19] room and correct me that's a prophet
[1:09:21] that's somebody that you think man he's
[1:09:22] just got a connection with God and
[1:09:24] everything God says he just said no he's
[1:09:26] human
[1:09:27] we're human beings
[1:09:30] so he said no prophet he said you need
[1:09:32] to go back and read that again
[1:09:35] I think you missed it
[1:09:37] that guy's a bluff
[1:09:39] and he said my God's Not a bluff
[1:09:43] Satan may be a bluff but I'm not so
[1:09:45] important here then see the
[1:09:47] brother around said oh I was going to
[1:09:49] make a horrible mistake
[1:09:51] I was going to teach that that man that
[1:09:53] was the awful devil was God
[1:09:58] a prophet don't get quiet on me
[1:10:02] that's what he said or it's on tape
[1:10:04] but knowledge signifies general
[1:10:07] intelligence understanding knowledge of
[1:10:09] what Christian religion the deeper and
[1:10:11] more perfect and enlarged knowledge of
[1:10:13] this religion such as belongs to the
[1:10:15] more advanced so we are we don't have
[1:10:18] just knowledge now we had our knowledge
[1:10:20] that we were born again
[1:10:22] now we must have Holy Ghost knowledge to
[1:10:24] teach us more
[1:10:27] because listen there's John 3 16 is in
[1:10:30] the Bible it takes up about that much of
[1:10:32] that whole Bible
[1:10:34] you can't just hone in on that
[1:10:36] right
[1:10:38] right you got 66 other books and all
[1:10:40] them chapters and all them verses that's
[1:10:42] what that's yours
[1:10:43] if you plug into John 3 16 you'll learn
[1:10:46] all those other things
[1:10:49] churches belong to the more advanced
[1:10:52] especially if things lawful and unlawful
[1:10:54] for Christians moral wisdom such as in
[1:10:57] seeing and right
[1:10:58] living see we have a knowledge now when
[1:11:01] brother Branham he comes and he's
[1:11:02] teaching the word of God and the words
[1:11:04] opening up to each one of us
[1:11:07] am I boring you
[1:11:09] okay well you got quiet a little bit
[1:11:11] brother Branham comes and he teaches and
[1:11:13] he's standing there and he says
[1:11:18] that father son Holy Ghost baptism is
[1:11:19] not right
[1:11:23] thousands of people hung their soul on
[1:11:26] that that it was right
[1:11:28] think about it think with me a minute
[1:11:30] here's brother Brown now I'm teaching it
[1:11:32] y'all and y'all are going oh yeah that's
[1:11:33] right okay yeah yeah let's move on yeah
[1:11:35] I know about the water baptism I know
[1:11:39] I'm not right but what about a group of
[1:11:40] people that built their whole soul their
[1:11:42] whole religion was based on that and
[1:11:45] he's trying to change their mind
[1:11:48] and they're resenting one right after
[1:11:50] the other
[1:11:51] and you know he could feel it
[1:11:54] you know he could feel it you know where
[1:11:56] it was coming from because a lot of time
[1:11:58] he stopped he said I wouldn't think that
[1:11:59] if I were you I mean it's like whoa what
[1:12:03] happened here
[1:12:05] yeah you know what that person they had
[1:12:08] an old moment they're like oh
[1:12:12] but think about that see it's easy for
[1:12:14] us to see when I preach it or anybody
[1:12:16] preaching it just flows
[1:12:18] even like the brother the other day said
[1:12:20] he liked preaching here why because it
[1:12:22] flows
[1:12:23] there's no resistance he just flows
[1:12:26] because we all have an understanding of
[1:12:28] the message of the hour
[1:12:29] but it's really tough to preach
[1:12:32] um to it would be if you went to a
[1:12:34] Baptist Church what would you preach
[1:12:36] Holy Ghost is not baptism
[1:12:39] uh the Trinity is not even in the Bible
[1:12:41] I mean here we go what are we going to
[1:12:43] do then all that's coming back those
[1:12:45] Spirits are coming back towards you and
[1:12:48] it hinders the move of God and that's
[1:12:50] what brother Brown was seeing it
[1:12:51] hindered the move of God to move on
[1:12:53] through those denominations out into not
[1:12:56] his message but the truth
[1:12:58] so it was hindering so he had to have
[1:13:01] listen he had to have every one of those
[1:13:03] virtues or he would have just I well if
[1:13:06] it'd been me
[1:13:08] I'd have got mad at him and said I'm
[1:13:10] done with you I'm going back somewhere
[1:13:11] and I'm gonna you know he even said that
[1:13:13] one time
[1:13:14] right he said I wish that I could do
[1:13:16] like Elijah and just step out and and
[1:13:19] give a prophecy and go back to the
[1:13:21] mountains and never see another person
[1:13:24] that's right he said why he got tired of
[1:13:28] fooling with them spirits
[1:13:30] every time he preached
[1:13:33] he coming he tell the Pentecostals he
[1:13:35] said I preach on cutting hair he said
[1:13:37] every year you get worse
[1:13:41] get worse I come back every year and you
[1:13:43] get worse
[1:13:44] what about a man preaching the truth and
[1:13:46] he doesn't see the results
[1:13:51] it tests your temperance
[1:13:54] it tests your patience
[1:13:57] I promise you one thing
[1:13:59] Elisha when he
[1:14:01] when he called out those she bears see
[1:14:03] if he had the Holy Ghost in his soul he
[1:14:06] wouldn't have done that
[1:14:08] he wouldn't have done that
[1:14:10] something would have stopped him
[1:14:13] brother Adam
[1:14:14] let's take the same case
[1:14:16] not the exact same case but let's take a
[1:14:19] case just like that brother random looks
[1:14:21] up in an audience and here's a man a boy
[1:14:23] and a girl making love up in up in the
[1:14:25] balcony
[1:14:27] he said stop don't do that
[1:14:29] keeps on going power of God's in the
[1:14:31] whole building he's Discerning he looks
[1:14:33] up and he says I told you to stop that
[1:14:37] then he said something spoke to him and
[1:14:39] said whatever you say
[1:14:41] that's what will happen
[1:14:43] whatever you say now if we would have
[1:14:46] been full of a lot of temperance that
[1:14:48] wasn't good
[1:14:50] they're disturbing the service this
[1:14:53] service has got to go away can't be up
[1:14:54] here doing that you know what he said he
[1:14:56] looked at him he said from right here he
[1:14:58] said he said I forgive you
[1:15:02] I forgive you
[1:15:04] remember God told him said if whatever
[1:15:06] you say they can pack them out dead
[1:15:07] right
[1:15:10] he could have said that he said both of
[1:15:13] you fall down and they'd have both fell
[1:15:14] dead
[1:15:15] that would have been the Elijah and
[1:15:17] Elisha of the Old Testament
[1:15:19] but not the Elijah of the New Testament
[1:15:21] Paul prayed
[1:15:24] praise the temperance he had patience
[1:15:28] he knew they were sinners
[1:15:30] he knew they were doing what they were
[1:15:32] taught to do by their daddy the devil
[1:15:38] he said I forgive you
[1:15:40] how many of us would do that
[1:15:43] don't answer
[1:15:44] me either me either because I mean you
[1:15:46] you get aggravated about certain things
[1:15:49] you're disturbing the service
[1:15:52] well
[1:15:54] just think about that how controlled he
[1:15:57] was you watched brother around
[1:15:58] everything was under control
[1:16:00] even with Jesus everything was under
[1:16:01] control that's when I and and I'm
[1:16:04] getting off a little bit on the over
[1:16:06] here on the metal inside but you know
[1:16:09] you take people in the message and they
[1:16:10] always want a certain kind of of service
[1:16:16] right right
[1:16:17] they have their five favorite preachers
[1:16:19] I'm just going to say it and they have
[1:16:22] their they want their five they want
[1:16:23] their results
[1:16:25] and that's what they get they get their
[1:16:26] results anything out of that enormous
[1:16:28] like nothing happened we didn't get
[1:16:30] anything today
[1:16:32] the spirit of the Lord just didn't move
[1:16:33] in here
[1:16:35] I thought the Bible said where the
[1:16:37] spirit of the Lord is there is wisdom
[1:16:40] wisdom to discern that yeah something is
[1:16:43] going on from right here to here
[1:16:45] from right here to here there's a lot
[1:16:47] going on
[1:16:49] I want you to think
[1:16:52] you can react later now this right here
[1:16:54] is not a good reaction
[1:16:56] but somewhere in between that
[1:17:00] somewhere in between that like brother
[1:17:02] George Smith he puts that puts that big
[1:17:04] old level up there and he says there's
[1:17:06] no balance
[1:17:08] we gotta have a balance
[1:17:11] and it is a balance we do have to have
[1:17:13] that
[1:17:14] but do not expect
[1:17:16] God
[1:17:18] to go by your results
[1:17:20] he'll go by his own
[1:17:22] he knows who needs it he knows who don't
[1:17:25] need it he's got his own timing we just
[1:17:28] got to be what brother I'm saying he
[1:17:30] said it's not he said I just make myself
[1:17:31] available
[1:17:32] you know what he said I'm waiting on him
[1:17:34] I'm making myself available for God to
[1:17:37] step in here and talk to you
[1:17:40] well praise the Lord that's the way it
[1:17:42] happens
[1:17:43] and the Lord God commanded a man stand
[1:17:45] of every tree now we can eat we're
[1:17:46] talking about eating the tree tree of
[1:17:48] knowledge of Good and Evil that's what
[1:17:49] we're eating on now but we are eating
[1:17:52] now off of the Tree of Life
[1:17:55] we are eating
[1:17:58] from that all the way up we are building
[1:18:00] what is that that's a building we are
[1:18:02] building something back zerubba was
[1:18:05] given a foundation he said and the Lord
[1:18:07] said build that Temple
[1:18:09] he built it back
[1:18:12] and who built it back let me ask you a
[1:18:13] question did this Ruben will just look
[1:18:15] at that and he went
[1:18:17] uh there's a pile of stones there's some
[1:18:19] wood
[1:18:20] brother Gary's built many houses like
[1:18:22] this he orders the wood he orders the
[1:18:23] bricks and he just stands there and goes
[1:18:24] all right build a house
[1:18:27] uh no he ain't done that
[1:18:29] no
[1:18:30] use people
[1:18:32] that were willing to work
[1:18:35] people that will put a trial in this
[1:18:37] hand and a sword in this hand build the
[1:18:40] thing build the wall build the same
[1:18:42] exception out for the enemy and that's
[1:18:43] the way we look
[1:18:45] and that's the way it is for us we're
[1:18:46] building something but we got to watch
[1:18:48] out for the enemy
[1:18:53] in the early church watch what happened
[1:18:54] the false Vine got intertwined with the
[1:18:57] True Vine it's not like we think it's
[1:19:00] way over here and you can tell the
[1:19:01] difference in this one and this one
[1:19:02] they're intertwined the only thing is is
[1:19:05] what we talked about this morning it's
[1:19:07] the maturity
[1:19:09] didn't Jesus say he said leave them
[1:19:11] alone in other words leave them alone
[1:19:13] through all these Church ages they're
[1:19:16] going to prove in the end whether
[1:19:17] they're seed or not seed
[1:19:20] is Pentecost the shark is now dead the
[1:19:24] shark had a purpose it protected the
[1:19:28] seed
[1:19:29] but once the shot pulled away or burst
[1:19:32] open what come out the seed that's where
[1:19:35] the life was the life wasn't in the
[1:19:36] shook
[1:19:37] it come through the shuck into the sea
[1:19:40] that's what we're feeding on today we're
[1:19:42] feeding on the seed word of God not the
[1:19:45] shut word of God
[1:19:47] everybody with me we're not feeding on
[1:19:49] the stock word of God now we might be in
[1:19:51] that stage in your journey but we're not
[1:19:53] feeding off of that we're feeding off
[1:19:55] the
[1:19:56] flesh of the son of man
[1:19:59] who is the Flesh of the son of man at
[1:20:01] the end time
[1:20:03] you are
[1:20:05] but it intertwined itself around the
[1:20:07] True Vine and we find these Deeds of the
[1:20:08] Nicolaitans and that spirit is going to
[1:20:10] be found look fighting the True Vine
[1:20:12] until it's destroyed
[1:20:14] by God
[1:20:16] that's why brother around them and we
[1:20:18] need to read it again
[1:20:19] the word of the church
[1:20:21] brother bam said bind together
[1:20:23] that's why the Bible says and I'm just
[1:20:25] going to read it again where the Bible
[1:20:26] says the more as a day approaches you're
[1:20:28] supposed to come together more
[1:20:30] not less
[1:20:32] come together more why because you need
[1:20:34] to intertwine ourselves together put our
[1:20:37] faith together put our faith muscles
[1:20:39] together what happens when a wolf is
[1:20:42] looking for you watch some of those
[1:20:44] shows and you see a leopard or you see
[1:20:45] Lions they run through that pack and
[1:20:48] that Pack's all packed up and all of a
[1:20:50] sudden one will jump out
[1:20:53] or either they'll take off if one's got
[1:20:55] a limp
[1:20:56] well you know what they don't go after
[1:20:58] that guy that's running 300 miles an
[1:20:59] hour
[1:21:00] they go after that guy's running 30
[1:21:02] miles an hour that's the same way the
[1:21:04] devil is he sees the one that's weak but
[1:21:06] you know what happens to praise God even
[1:21:08] in nature if it's a calf guess what's
[1:21:10] going to happen mama's gonna turn around
[1:21:13] and she's gonna oh
[1:21:16] she's gonna run back and say that's my
[1:21:19] baby
[1:21:20] take me if you need to but leave my kid
[1:21:22] alone that's what we ought to say about
[1:21:24] our kids leave our kids alone devil I
[1:21:27] know they've got out of the past I know
[1:21:29] they got out somewhere in the wilderness
[1:21:30] I know they're out there fighting but
[1:21:32] God don't do don't let them die
[1:21:35] go find them
[1:21:41] thirdly add knowledge no that don't mean
[1:21:44] worldly knowledge because that's
[1:21:45] foolishness to God
[1:21:47] what is knowledge done in this end time
[1:21:49] it's killed more people than it's helped
[1:21:54] gunpowder cars hey cars kill more people
[1:21:56] than anything in the world
[1:21:59] Wars and everything more people die in
[1:22:01] auto accidents than anything
[1:22:03] yet guess what we're gonna go get in
[1:22:06] that missile and drive to the house
[1:22:10] and we're gonna have some that's got
[1:22:12] Electric
[1:22:16] and it's got Bluetooth and Wi-Fi and we
[1:22:19] can let go of the steering wheel and it
[1:22:21] drives itself
[1:22:26] yeah
[1:22:27] do like that Google card did that time
[1:22:29] it didn't stop
[1:22:33] I think humans still ought to be driving
[1:22:34] a car
[1:22:35] we make enough mistake
[1:22:38] but knowledge that don't mean world in
[1:22:41] all this because that's foolishness to
[1:22:42] God but knowledge to what to judge
[1:22:46] knowledge to judge
[1:22:48] you got to look at that Bible and judge
[1:22:50] whether you can do it or not
[1:22:53] you got to look at the message of the
[1:22:55] hour you got to look at what I'm saying
[1:22:57] brother Dale all the different ones are
[1:22:58] saying you got to look at that and you
[1:22:59] got to judge whether that's right or
[1:23:00] wrong right
[1:23:02] that's for you to do that's why this
[1:23:04] that's why it's a two-way street like
[1:23:06] the old saying is
[1:23:08] how do you judge it then if you got you
[1:23:10] got Christian not
[1:23:11] with your
[1:23:16] you judge whether the word is right or
[1:23:18] wrong
[1:23:19] but when you see that the scripture is
[1:23:22] not contradictory that you can say that
[1:23:24] and can see that look by the Revelation
[1:23:27] in other words by the unveiling of God
[1:23:29] you see the whole word is wrote in
[1:23:32] Mysteries and only the knowledge of God
[1:23:35] can reveal him that's why brother Brown
[1:23:38] did not use a Billy Graham or Oral
[1:23:42] Roberts or all these great people that
[1:23:44] went to college went to Bible College to
[1:23:46] learn how to form your form your message
[1:23:51] get them right here you know and and Bam
[1:23:54] in the middle and then soften it up at
[1:23:56] the bottom I've seen people told me that
[1:23:58] that's what they do they tell you how to
[1:24:00] preach
[1:24:03] think about that one
[1:24:06] so who's preaching the denomination is
[1:24:08] preaching
[1:24:10] says you're preaching what they tell you
[1:24:12] to you know
[1:24:14] but not us that's why brother random
[1:24:16] seventh grade education can't hardly
[1:24:18] understand what he's talking about
[1:24:19] sometimes we did
[1:24:21] that's why we got an excuse maybe then
[1:24:23] people in the foreign countries or even
[1:24:24] people up north going to excuse you and
[1:24:26] I don't have an excuse we don't want
[1:24:27] Mater's Invaders is we know what a mule
[1:24:29] is we know what we know what a corn bed
[1:24:32] is we know what this is when we know
[1:24:34] that
[1:24:35] some of them don't even know what that
[1:24:36] is but we do
[1:24:39] the only knowledge of God can reveal it
[1:24:41] then when you get in say punctuate every
[1:24:43] word of God with an amen then add that
[1:24:46] to your faith
[1:24:48] anybody with me
[1:24:50] and I keep coming back to this because I
[1:24:52] believe this there's a spirit of wisdom
[1:24:53] that's going to come into this church
[1:24:55] I'm talking about this church and any
[1:24:56] other message Church's preaching the
[1:24:57] word of God the spirit of wisdom
[1:25:01] knowing how to handle things like I said
[1:25:03] before a word to church brother Brown
[1:25:04] said buying closer together he said
[1:25:06] don't let Satan get in between you don't
[1:25:08] let him shoot you with a dart don't let
[1:25:10] him divide you bring everything together
[1:25:14] because you know what then then then
[1:25:15] what's going to happen the flow is going
[1:25:17] to be much better when it flows like the
[1:25:20] brother said he likes to preach here why
[1:25:21] does he like to preach here he don't
[1:25:23] have to sit in background for 30 minutes
[1:25:26] or he doesn't feel see you're gonna I'm
[1:25:28] up here now and even the minister then
[1:25:30] you can feel a certain way you're going
[1:25:31] and you can feel it it's like it's like
[1:25:33] it's pushing
[1:25:35] right brother Bob write different ones
[1:25:36] brother well other brothers are not
[1:25:38] built down you it feels like this and
[1:25:41] guess what you do brother that's he's
[1:25:42] explained it many times you go this way
[1:25:45] and see that might be God dealing with
[1:25:48] this one or that may be the devil trying
[1:25:50] to get you to not go down this way
[1:25:52] so you're sitting here I mean who needs
[1:25:55] to discernment this day and time
[1:25:57] just look at faces
[1:26:00] I got it
[1:26:02] anyway
[1:26:03] but the spirit of wisdom there are a
[1:26:05] group of people
[1:26:06] I contend this is a group of people that
[1:26:09] has the spirit of wisdom
[1:26:12] it will come into the church to what to
[1:26:14] make known to the church by the
[1:26:17] revelation of the Holy Spirit
[1:26:19] so see that's kind of a threefold thing
[1:26:21] it's not just we're just going to have
[1:26:23] wisdom
[1:26:25] no
[1:26:27] bye revelation of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:32] bringing the church in and revealing
[1:26:34] what day we're living you said bro wait
[1:26:36] we know what day we're living we're
[1:26:37] living in the United States now do you
[1:26:39] really know what day you living in
[1:26:40] you're living in a bride day you're
[1:26:42] living in a day where you got to get up
[1:26:44] that statue of perfect man
[1:26:47] well you can say man if you want to but
[1:26:49] I'll say it man that's exactly where
[1:26:50] we're at
[1:26:51] foreign
[1:26:53] time of play is over with
[1:26:56] the foolish version played
[1:26:59] that's why they didn't have no oil
[1:27:01] they played around the wise virgins took
[1:27:05] oil they knew something was coming they
[1:27:07] knew because remember they both went to
[1:27:09] sleep at the same time
[1:27:11] but they did go to sleep with one full
[1:27:14] and one empty
[1:27:16] they were prepared these were not
[1:27:20] we got to be prepared
[1:27:28] let's skip on a little bit more 3 30.
[1:27:31] there's nothing such prevailing power
[1:27:33] and I to me I like to read this again
[1:27:35] look prevailing power not just listen we
[1:27:37] have a service and the power of God just
[1:27:41] like we had not too long ago
[1:27:43] power guard just swept in the building
[1:27:45] he just felt when I was standing up here
[1:27:47] when brother Daryl was here it was like
[1:27:49] raindrops
[1:27:50] it was like a tingle
[1:27:52] and just standing there and just feeling
[1:27:54] it
[1:27:55] knowing that y'all were feeling it too
[1:27:56] now see that's a that's a a
[1:28:02] that says prevailing power
[1:28:05] prevailing power is this your graph
[1:28:07] don't look like this
[1:28:09] like your bank account
[1:28:15] no it's prevailing power it's power that
[1:28:18] does this right here all the way through
[1:28:20] doesn't matter doesn't matter if Satan
[1:28:22] comes out
[1:28:24] the mouth the Devil comes at you gives
[1:28:25] you a headache gives you what
[1:28:27] doesn't matter if somebody comes along
[1:28:29] says oh you're not preaching you're not
[1:28:30] that word that brother Brown he's just
[1:28:34] prevailing power it prevails over every
[1:28:37] bit of that
[1:28:40] we do have ups and downs
[1:28:42] the prevailing
[1:28:45] in the middle
[1:28:47] there's nothing such prevailing powers
[1:28:49] of revelation of the word
[1:28:51] so in this verse 3 is a blessing
[1:28:53] pronounced on those who give attention
[1:28:55] to this book come with the Bible
[1:28:58] now that word revelation we were talking
[1:29:00] about this morning jump to it real quick
[1:29:01] let's read it just for a second
[1:29:03] Revelation is the act or Pro look all is
[1:29:06] emotions
[1:29:09] still a revelation is not sitting still
[1:29:14] a revelation is that brother Ernie said
[1:29:16] it's dunamis it's power there's no such
[1:29:20] prevailing power as a revelation you
[1:29:22] want something to sustain you get a
[1:29:25] revelation
[1:29:26] man man it will sustain you from this
[1:29:28] and this and this and this and this is
[1:29:32] prevailing
[1:29:39] the active process of what disclosing
[1:29:42] something previously Secret
[1:29:44] how many times you come into a service
[1:29:46] and I have to
[1:29:48] like Roselle said one time he's as smart
[1:29:49] as I am I didn't think of that
[1:29:51] but how many of you have come into a
[1:29:53] place and you and somebody brings
[1:29:54] something out and you go wow
[1:29:57] I never seen that before well I didn't
[1:30:00] mean that a brand new book came out
[1:30:02] that didn't mean that a 67th book of the
[1:30:06] Bible came out you were reading it the
[1:30:08] whole time but something was veiled
[1:30:12] right and whose fault was it
[1:30:17] and mine but it's our fault
[1:30:20] no it was the devil not just me
[1:30:23] so the act act action
[1:30:26] or process plan
[1:30:29] of disclosing something previously
[1:30:31] secret or obscure especially something
[1:30:33] true a fact disclosed or revealed
[1:30:36] especially in a dramatic or a surprising
[1:30:40] way
[1:30:41] that aha moment Ah that's what that
[1:30:44] means
[1:30:45] Christianity and Christianity it's God's
[1:30:47] disclosure look of his own nature and
[1:30:49] now what we're talking about now
[1:30:51] well and I come from Webster I'm sorry
[1:30:54] that came from the internet
[1:30:56] Google I just did it back there a few
[1:30:58] minutes ago
[1:31:00] devil went nowhere around that was me
[1:31:03] God's disclosure of his own nature
[1:31:07] and look his purpose
[1:31:09] for mankind his plan
[1:31:11] for mankind especially through the words
[1:31:13] of human intermediaries oh sorry guys
[1:31:16] gotta hear it through us
[1:31:19] something in which such a Divine
[1:31:21] disclosure is contained such as the
[1:31:24] Bible
[1:31:27] said that prevailing overcoming now look
[1:31:29] Church
[1:31:30] is built on Revelation so we can expect
[1:31:33] God
[1:31:36] somebody say that with me expect God
[1:31:39] to reveal it to us
[1:31:42] take on his word sit down and say God I
[1:31:44] don't know what they're talking about I
[1:31:47] don't know about this adoption but you
[1:31:48] know what you do you say I don't know
[1:31:50] about this adoption and then you go
[1:31:52] watch YouTube for three hours
[1:31:53] hmm
[1:31:55] come on
[1:31:56] all right if if if
[1:31:58] Luis was here Netflix
[1:32:01] sends you a notification that there's a
[1:32:05] new something on
[1:32:08] guilty
[1:32:13] but why don't we get things
[1:32:15] we don't make ourselves available
[1:32:17] oh we make ourselves available to other
[1:32:19] things but to prevailing overcoming
[1:32:21] church is what built on Revelation so we
[1:32:23] can expect God to reveal it to us but we
[1:32:26] can't expect him to reveal it to us like
[1:32:27] I said reading as brothers always said
[1:32:29] gears Almanac if you know what that is
[1:32:31] so maybe we don't know what that is it's
[1:32:33] a farmer's calendar to tell you what to
[1:32:35] grow and what not to grow what sign to
[1:32:38] plan under and what you know if it's
[1:32:39] going to be a bad win or yeah anyway
[1:32:42] so that's an almanac they put it
[1:32:44] together a bunch of old people put it
[1:32:45] together
[1:32:47] so we can expect God to reveal his truth
[1:32:49] to us look however
[1:32:51] you don't need a revelation on water
[1:32:53] baptism
[1:32:54] he's staring you right in the face now
[1:32:56] wait a minute hold on brother Brown Hold
[1:32:59] On yeah
[1:33:00] if 500 people were sitting in this
[1:33:03] congregation well thousand people
[1:33:06] 950 of them
[1:33:08] would have said that ain't right
[1:33:12] because they're trinitarians they were
[1:33:14] baptized all in the name of father son
[1:33:15] Holy Ghost and he just told him he said
[1:33:17] it's staring you right in the face
[1:33:21] that's why they didn't like him
[1:33:24] Hebrews 5 13 will get well I'm gonna get
[1:33:27] somewhere here I'm gonna get to
[1:33:29] temper temperance
[1:33:32] for everyone that uses milk is
[1:33:35] unskillful in the word of racism for his
[1:33:37] debate now listen milk will sustain you
[1:33:40] milk will you know it'll help you live
[1:33:41] but it won't help you grow
[1:33:44] but strong meat belonged to them that
[1:33:46] are what a full age even those who by
[1:33:48] reason of use have their senses exercise
[1:33:50] to what you deserve Good and Evil
[1:33:53] discern means to what separate make a
[1:33:55] distinction
[1:33:57] discriminate
[1:33:59] I'm sorry
[1:34:00] God's a discriminator he does not want
[1:34:02] us to deal with the world he does not
[1:34:04] want us to go with certain people he
[1:34:05] wants us to discriminate everybody with
[1:34:07] me all right that kind of discrimination
[1:34:09] I'll go with you all right to prefer
[1:34:17] this is a familiar quote let's read it
[1:34:18] Christ in the true church now I like
[1:34:20] what brother Brown talks about the true
[1:34:22] church
[1:34:23] there's a false Church
[1:34:25] the Bible tells you there's a false
[1:34:27] Church
[1:34:28] Christ in the true church is a what
[1:34:30] continuation of the book of Acts but the
[1:34:33] Book of Revelation shows how that the
[1:34:34] Antichrist Spirit would come into the
[1:34:36] church
[1:34:37] and defile it make it lukewarm
[1:34:41] formal
[1:34:42] and Powerless
[1:34:45] it exposes Satan revealing his Works
[1:34:47] attempted destruction of God's people
[1:34:49] discrediting in the word we know that we
[1:34:51] see that
[1:34:52] I mean when people are like I said
[1:34:54] before you take you take the ministry of
[1:34:56] William Branham
[1:34:57] and you look and you go for 30 something
[1:34:59] years and and it goes and progresses
[1:35:02] like it does through the word of God and
[1:35:04] through the healing campaign but it then
[1:35:06] into the opening of the word how can you
[1:35:07] call that false
[1:35:10] listen Satan can't hold that together
[1:35:12] God can
[1:35:13] God held that together with that man he
[1:35:15] held that together with brother Brown
[1:35:16] all through till the day he passed away
[1:35:19] oh and that's another thing what that
[1:35:21] little
[1:35:23] he's a brother
[1:35:25] what that little brother saying about
[1:35:27] brother Branham not being a good Bible
[1:35:30] uh teacher
[1:35:32] basically what he was saying was is that
[1:35:34] brother random was fine until he was
[1:35:36] preaching Doctrine and then God
[1:35:39] let him die
[1:35:41] and I've heard that before dad's heard
[1:35:43] it too
[1:35:44] that that that uh brother Brown got to
[1:35:47] messing around and things he shouldn't
[1:35:48] got messing around in you know like the
[1:35:50] truth of the scripture and and God took
[1:35:52] him off the scene why would God take
[1:35:53] somebody out saying if it was the truth
[1:35:56] he was just done he was finished with
[1:35:57] brother Branham
[1:35:59] he knew brother Brown stayed around here
[1:36:00] longer and longer that everybody would
[1:36:02] just totally look to the man
[1:36:06] he knows that if the people get the true
[1:36:08] Revelation so there is a true revelation
[1:36:10] of the true church true true true and
[1:36:12] what she is and what she stands for and
[1:36:14] she can do the Greater Works she will be
[1:36:16] an invincible Army if they get a true
[1:36:19] Revelation what of the two spirits the
[1:36:22] two intertwined
[1:36:25] to intertwine knowledge of Good and Evil
[1:36:27] Tree of Life
[1:36:29] or then the framework of the Christian
[1:36:30] church and by God's spirit look discern
[1:36:33] in other words have knowledge
[1:36:35] and withstand the Antichrist Christ's
[1:36:37] Spirit Satan will be powerless
[1:36:41] that's enough for me
[1:36:44] because we think he's this great
[1:36:45] powerful person
[1:36:47] he's not
[1:36:49] resist the devil
[1:36:52] he'll flee from you resist
[1:36:57] like going shopping at Walmart when they
[1:36:59] got up where's Richard at
[1:37:02] go shopping at hamricks
[1:37:06] you can resist that thing oh devil
[1:37:10] we didn't last night we just had a bad
[1:37:12] problem last night
[1:37:13] Walmart had all their hunting gear on
[1:37:15] sale
[1:37:19] I got off of that I don't know he will
[1:37:21] beer is definitely thwarted today is
[1:37:23] when Christ
[1:37:23] with his every effort to gain power over
[1:37:25] and in the desert what did Jesus use in
[1:37:27] the desert
[1:37:29] no he spoke to him
[1:37:32] he said Satan is written
[1:37:34] do not tempt the Lord thy God
[1:37:38] it is written it is written it was Satan
[1:37:40] knew he finally had to leave him I want
[1:37:42] Satan to be so aggravated with me that
[1:37:43] he'll leave me
[1:37:45] hello somebody
[1:37:47] I wanted to be so aggravated
[1:37:50] I try over here and he's got it blocked
[1:37:53] I try over here and he's got it blocked
[1:37:57] I'm talking about he the holy spirit's
[1:37:58] got him the devil blocked can't get in
[1:38:01] what that right there
[1:38:03] hook block right here
[1:38:05] block right here he's already got this
[1:38:08] block block right here block here block
[1:38:11] here guess what then devil just plays
[1:38:13] with your body but let me tell you
[1:38:15] something
[1:38:17] remember when God
[1:38:19] said if you consider my servant job
[1:38:22] said you got a hedge built around him
[1:38:24] and I can't get to him
[1:38:27] he said if you'll take that hedge down
[1:38:28] he said I'll make him curse you to your
[1:38:31] face
[1:38:33] try so he tried a little bit and he come
[1:38:37] back and he said hey you got a hedge
[1:38:39] belt around him where was the Hedge the
[1:38:41] Hedge now was right here
[1:38:44] because he said now you go ahead and
[1:38:46] touch his body and even in his Spirit
[1:38:48] realm job's like
[1:38:50] I don't know what is going on and he's
[1:38:53] got three friends that are supposed to
[1:38:54] be his friends I hope you all don't have
[1:38:56] friends like them three friends were
[1:38:58] but remember it was three friends that
[1:39:00] were white they were accusing him of
[1:39:02] everything
[1:39:04] but my whenever you come on the same
[1:39:06] when number four
[1:39:08] whenever you walked up being a young man
[1:39:10] not not being some great something and
[1:39:12] not even being a friend of Joe
[1:39:15] he said Joe get up stand on your feet
[1:39:18] I'm gonna tell you something
[1:39:20] that was Jesus Christ in that man
[1:39:23] telling job
[1:39:25] that look job
[1:39:26] quit looking for all these things
[1:39:29] I know you're a righteous man
[1:39:32] I know these things and job got so much
[1:39:35] of Revelation he said oh I know my
[1:39:36] redeemer liveth
[1:39:38] in other words I know there's a chance
[1:39:40] with these other three friends I got I
[1:39:42] ain't got a chance in the world
[1:39:44] they called him a secret Center they
[1:39:45] called him everything in the world
[1:39:47] but Yahoo said stand on your feet you'll
[1:39:49] be a man
[1:39:51] you got it inside of you because God's
[1:39:53] got a hedge around it
[1:39:55] let it out
[1:39:57] and job started speaking and them three
[1:39:59] friends just went off into the road off
[1:40:00] into the distance
[1:40:02] and what did job do he was restored or
[1:40:05] redeemed back everybody with me on them
[1:40:07] so virtue knowledge we just talked about
[1:40:09] knowledge so it's Holy Ghost knowledge
[1:40:11] you got to discern you're sitting here
[1:40:12] today like I said before you're
[1:40:13] discerning
[1:40:16] you go home tonight you're still
[1:40:18] discerning
[1:40:19] you get up in the morning go to work
[1:40:20] you're still discerning
[1:40:24] so let's go under knowledge let's go
[1:40:26] into Temperance just for a minute
[1:40:30] just for about five minutes
[1:40:33] ten princes white self-control
[1:40:37] the virtue of one who Masters his
[1:40:39] desires and Passions
[1:40:43] especially his sensual appetites
[1:40:45] self-control
[1:40:47] because remember the the meaning in the
[1:40:51] dictionary is over here on this side
[1:40:53] that says Temperance is being able to
[1:40:56] control yourself from drinking alcohol
[1:40:59] right
[1:41:00] brother Brown told us that but he said
[1:41:02] it's not that kind of temperance
[1:41:03] he said it's controlling your
[1:41:05] uncontrollable temper over here on this
[1:41:07] side
[1:41:08] so self-control it's strong it's robust
[1:41:12] it has power over
[1:41:17] don't raise your hand
[1:41:19] how many of you have mastered that power
[1:41:21] yet
[1:41:23] didn't think so
[1:41:25] me either
[1:41:27] but we're working on it
[1:41:29] we're working on it he's still working
[1:41:32] on me
[1:41:34] mastering or controlling or curbing
[1:41:38] straining
[1:41:40] control oneself because when you get a
[1:41:43] temper you're what out of what control
[1:41:48] you're out of control you can't control
[1:41:50] yourself
[1:41:51] but brother I was talking about having
[1:41:52] that kind of temperance to control
[1:41:54] yourself control that temper
[1:41:58] that's in the spirit realm not in your
[1:42:00] soul
[1:42:01] it's in your spirit with all my spirit
[1:42:03] now we're talking about the spirit realm
[1:42:04] we're not talking about the soul
[1:42:07] the soul that's inside of you stood one
[1:42:10] day in the temple
[1:42:12] come on somebody
[1:42:14] and he saw him doing something that God
[1:42:16] that was that was not right
[1:42:20] and he sat there and he platted the Rope
[1:42:23] but you know what I believe he done
[1:42:24] while he was planting a rope he says
[1:42:25] Lord
[1:42:26] if they only knew
[1:42:28] who I was
[1:42:30] the reason they turned me down is why
[1:42:32] they're doing that and he planted that
[1:42:33] rope and guess what he done he didn't
[1:42:34] walk over there and tap him on the
[1:42:36] shoulder and ask him to leave
[1:42:38] the Bible said he drove him out of the
[1:42:40] temple turned over the tables
[1:42:49] but he asked us
[1:42:51] to curb that
[1:42:52] he asked us to control that
[1:42:55] and restrain from doing that
[1:42:59] listen what are you saying you're gonna
[1:43:01] get upset
[1:43:03] you're gonna get upset now when we got
[1:43:05] upset before the upset came from here
[1:43:07] and we upset it like he's we upsetted
[1:43:10] the uh we turned over the trash can we
[1:43:12] kicked uh
[1:43:15] whatever brother whatever whatever was
[1:43:18] there and usually when we kicked it it
[1:43:20] really hurt
[1:43:21] afterwards if you ever heard yourself
[1:43:23] being mad come on you raise your hand
[1:43:24] now have you ever heard yourself be a
[1:43:25] mad day and raise your head then thank
[1:43:27] you bro
[1:43:29] wasn't that kind of dumb
[1:43:31] you wasn't hurting to begin with
[1:43:33] your foot wasn't throbbing
[1:43:36] but you got mad at somebody else and you
[1:43:38] hurt yourself
[1:43:40] that came from God yep that came for the
[1:43:44] devil actually that came from you right
[1:43:47] right all right look I had Temperance
[1:43:48] real quick and then we'll close them
[1:43:49] we've come to Temperance now you've had
[1:43:52] Faith first
[1:43:53] have to have that look he has to have
[1:43:55] that he never gets away from that Faith
[1:43:57] you've got to have faith
[1:43:59] you got to have faith
[1:44:01] first have to have that to begin with
[1:44:04] then you add virtue or power to your
[1:44:07] faith if it's the right kind of virtue
[1:44:09] then you add knowledge if it's the right
[1:44:11] kind of knowledge which what I it's Holy
[1:44:12] Ghost knowledge
[1:44:14] now you're going to add Temperance
[1:44:16] Temperance doesn't mean stop drinking
[1:44:18] alcohol you should have started that
[1:44:20] it's the new birth
[1:44:25] you're not stop drinking why are you
[1:44:27] going up such a perfect man
[1:44:30] if not you need to go back down and
[1:44:32] start over again because you ain't born
[1:44:33] again
[1:44:34] okay no no Temperance doesn't mean
[1:44:37] alcoholic cure not in this case this is
[1:44:40] Bible Temperance Holy Spirit Temperance
[1:44:43] that's just one of the lusts of the
[1:44:44] flesh what the drinking of the alcohol
[1:44:46] but we're talking about Holy Spirit
[1:44:48] Temperance that means how to control
[1:44:49] your tongue
[1:44:52] not be a tadler how to control your
[1:44:55] temper not fly off every time somebody
[1:44:56] speaks across to your mind
[1:44:59] boy a lot of this is going to fall off
[1:45:00] before we get started aren't we
[1:45:03] see then we wonder why God is not in his
[1:45:06] church
[1:45:09] Read that read it to yourself
[1:45:13] then we wonder
[1:45:15] in Lula Church why God's not moving well
[1:45:17] we're just flat there's nothing going on
[1:45:22] then we wonder why God is not in this
[1:45:25] church doing Miracles and things that
[1:45:27] they used to do
[1:45:28] yes sir
[1:45:31] brother Brown said add these things add
[1:45:33] Temperance oh Temperance how to
[1:45:35] answering kindness
[1:45:37] when wrath is spoke to you
[1:45:41] somebody says you bunch of Holy Rollers
[1:45:43] down there don't jump up and roll up
[1:45:44] your sleeve not that
[1:45:47] but taught with Godly love Temple all
[1:45:49] y'all quiet
[1:45:51] oh y'all all quiet
[1:45:54] I'd be clocked too but I gotta talk
[1:45:57] with Godly love Temperance kindness
[1:46:01] is that the way you want to be
[1:46:03] congregation says
[1:46:05] those of you that didn't say man you can
[1:46:07] either you need to find you another
[1:46:08] church
[1:46:09] this one's not this one's not perfect
[1:46:11] enough for you when you're riled upon
[1:46:13] look round up back
[1:46:16] let him be your example when they said
[1:46:18] if thou be the Son of God turn these
[1:46:20] stones into bread he could have done it
[1:46:22] and showed he was God
[1:46:25] but he had Temperance when they called
[1:46:27] him belzebub he said I'll forgive you
[1:46:29] for that
[1:46:30] they pulled hands full of beard out of
[1:46:32] his face and spit in his face and said
[1:46:34] come down off the cross he said father
[1:46:35] forgive them they don't even know what
[1:46:38] they're doing
[1:46:40] when he had a gift he knowed all things
[1:46:43] for in him was the fullness of the
[1:46:44] godhead bodily they had seen him perform
[1:46:46] Miracles by telling people what was
[1:46:48] wrong with him and so forth they put a
[1:46:50] rag on his head and around his eyes and
[1:46:51] hit him on the head and said Prophet saw
[1:46:53] tell us who hit you we'll believe you
[1:46:55] see he had temperance
[1:46:59] now if you got it like that
[1:47:02] add it to your faith
[1:47:04] if you still blow up and Sass and fuss
[1:47:07] and stew
[1:47:09] and carry on
[1:47:12] uh-huh
[1:47:14] you can't add that
[1:47:17] because it won't add
[1:47:19] this is what I want to get to right here
[1:47:21] remember we talk about Vulcanizing I
[1:47:23] tried to explain it
[1:47:25] I'm gonna let Google explain it for you
[1:47:27] because they some real good nuggets in
[1:47:29] this if you'll be a little spiritual in
[1:47:30] just a few minutes turn off the natural
[1:47:32] turn on the spiritual all right it won't
[1:47:34] vulcanize why did Brother Brown use that
[1:47:36] word vulcanized he only uses it one time
[1:47:38] in in the Statue of perfect man never
[1:47:40] uses it again
[1:47:43] because he's wanting these things to be
[1:47:44] vulcanized in you
[1:47:47] it won't vulcanize
[1:47:49] you couldn't take a piece of rubber you
[1:47:51] know and vulcanize it to a piece of iron
[1:47:53] before we get started I want to tell you
[1:47:54] where that word come from that word
[1:47:55] comes from the god Vulcan
[1:47:58] he's the god of fire and something else
[1:48:01] so they called it Vulcanizing guess who
[1:48:03] started that Mr Goodyear the one that
[1:48:05] makes a Goodyear tires
[1:48:08] in 1919 or something when they started
[1:48:10] making tires he went the they went to a
[1:48:13] vulcanization process which put the the
[1:48:16] rubber together and he called it
[1:48:18] Vulcanizing because it took heat and so
[1:48:20] heat and fire I think is the god Vulcan
[1:48:22] is the god so they called it
[1:48:23] vulcanization why don't you learn
[1:48:25] something if you didn't learn anything
[1:48:26] else but those would be the worst their
[1:48:28] sleep you didn't learn anything he
[1:48:30] couldn't take a piece of rubber you know
[1:48:31] and vulcanized it to a piece of iron it
[1:48:33] just won't work
[1:48:34] no it's got
[1:48:38] yeah so that one
[1:48:41] flexible just like the rubber is
[1:48:44] and when your faith and your Temperance
[1:48:46] becomes the same kind of Holy Ghost
[1:48:49] Temperance that he had then it will
[1:48:52] vulcanize with him
[1:48:54] you're added to it
[1:48:57] it's real quick and then we'll close I
[1:48:59] know it's a little bit long but
[1:49:01] y'all stand outside for 45 minutes to an
[1:49:04] hour and talk so let's talk about God
[1:49:06] while we're in here okay when your
[1:49:09] knowledge is like his knowledge I came
[1:49:11] to do thy will o God see with the
[1:49:13] father's word he defeated every devil
[1:49:15] Heaven and Earth will pass away but the
[1:49:17] word will not pass away when you got
[1:49:19] that kind of knowledge it'll vulcanize
[1:49:21] with your faith when you've got that
[1:49:23] right kind of temperance like he had
[1:49:25] it'll vulcanize if you haven't just a
[1:49:28] man-made halfway South stuff they might
[1:49:30] know what that means
[1:49:34] a Southerners do
[1:49:37] I'll explain it later for another day
[1:49:40] we'll explain that for another day
[1:49:42] if you got a halfway south-step belief
[1:49:45] or Temperance oh
[1:49:47] shown but I better not cause
[1:49:49] brother so and so see me and I'll get my
[1:49:52] name put in the paper
[1:49:54] wait a minute or I have my name on
[1:49:57] Facebook or Tick Tock or Instagram
[1:50:01] if Luis is here you could explain what
[1:50:02] those are
[1:50:08] paper about it that ain't the kind of
[1:50:09] temperance he's talking about don't try
[1:50:11] to add that it won't work but when you
[1:50:14] can I don't y'all read them ahead of me
[1:50:16] I don't want you to read ahead of me but
[1:50:17] when you can really look with the
[1:50:19] sweetness from your heart forgive every
[1:50:20] man
[1:50:22] you know what Billy Paul said about
[1:50:23] brother Brown he never could tell who
[1:50:25] was brother Brown's enemy or who's his
[1:50:26] friend now you and I are not to that
[1:50:28] point yet
[1:50:34] because everything we do is conditional
[1:50:36] in the in the state we're in right now
[1:50:40] Regina says something bad about me
[1:50:44] you turned every light in my house on
[1:50:45] three four years ago
[1:50:48] and I'm still paying the power bill
[1:50:53] I'm sorry Regina
[1:50:55] I apologize
[1:50:57] I really am I apologize Hey listen I'm
[1:50:59] trying to get I've got this Hey listen I
[1:51:01] got this pretty cat this thing is so
[1:51:03] cute
[1:51:05] I'll show you a picture
[1:51:08] but I had to overcome that because I
[1:51:09] hated cats I'm telling y'all I hated
[1:51:11] cats it was one good kind of cat and
[1:51:12] that was a dead one
[1:51:14] they come to my house they died of lead
[1:51:15] poisoning
[1:51:17] I'm sorry that's just the way I was I
[1:51:19] didn't like cats but I love them now
[1:51:20] because God told me he said that's my
[1:51:22] that's my nature too that's my animals
[1:51:24] you leave them alone now he told me that
[1:51:27] and I've never heard much spoken in my
[1:51:28] brain but that was spoke in my brain
[1:51:30] that I needed to what work on my
[1:51:32] temperance
[1:51:34] and my patience
[1:51:37] listen I'll tell you what I'm thinking
[1:51:39] what are y'all gonna do
[1:51:44] all right thank you I believe it will
[1:51:45] but when you can really with the
[1:51:47] sweetness from your heart forgive every
[1:51:49] man hold your peace let it be gone see
[1:51:53] then it'll vulcanize
[1:51:56] you can add that to your faith now look
[1:51:58] Faith now watch this this is why brother
[1:52:00] Brown used this word vulcanized now
[1:52:02] listen there was a Webster's Dictionary
[1:52:03] back then but you had to do this
[1:52:06] all I got to do is put it in Google and
[1:52:08] it pops right up
[1:52:10] science direct explains I want you to
[1:52:12] think about this why did he use that
[1:52:14] word vulcanized right here at Temperance
[1:52:17] look we're already three virtues up
[1:52:19] because remember face another verse it's
[1:52:21] not an ad you add two
[1:52:23] Temperance he's got up to Temperance and
[1:52:25] he's wanting us to see something because
[1:52:26] he never mentions it again
[1:52:28] all right
[1:52:33] don't you be reading that
[1:52:39] Mary
[1:52:42] get back to vulcanization or rubber now
[1:52:44] this is rubber watch science direct is
[1:52:47] wake up just a minute and I'll teach you
[1:52:48] something science direct explains that
[1:52:50] vulcanization changes the physical
[1:52:54] read this spiritually
[1:52:57] why did Brother Branham say vulcanized
[1:53:00] he could have said glued
[1:53:03] he could have said patched put together
[1:53:05] a song He said vulcanize
[1:53:09] it changes the physical properties
[1:53:13] of the rubber by forcing it to retract
[1:53:19] me
[1:53:22] of course there are mechanical y'all
[1:53:25] quit reading down that far
[1:53:28] cheaters
[1:53:30] you need patience
[1:53:33] we'll get to that next Sunday
[1:53:34] of course there are look mechanical
[1:53:36] methods that can force rubber to retract
[1:53:39] as well the difference with
[1:53:41] vulcanization
[1:53:42] is that it come on somebody you all need
[1:53:45] to look at this it retains the original
[1:53:47] shape
[1:53:50] of the rubber
[1:53:52] when vulcanization is performed on
[1:53:54] rubber the rubber shrinks while
[1:53:56] retaining oh straight Me Lord
[1:54:00] treat me where there's nothing left of
[1:54:02] me sure my physical being is going to be
[1:54:05] here sure my outside is going to stay
[1:54:07] here I hope he gets a little skinnier
[1:54:09] when we get on Weight Watchers but
[1:54:11] anyway that has nothing to do with our
[1:54:13] Salvation when vulcanization is
[1:54:15] performed on the rubber the rubber
[1:54:17] shrinks while retaining its original
[1:54:19] shape
[1:54:20] vulcanization essentially scales down
[1:54:23] rubber to a smaller size
[1:54:25] all without deforming
[1:54:30] are altering its shape
[1:54:33] in addition to altering its size while
[1:54:35] retaining its shape vulcanization also
[1:54:38] protects rubber
[1:54:40] [Music]
[1:54:41] from future deformation
[1:54:44] praise God
[1:54:47] as it shrinks rubber hardens and becomes
[1:54:50] less vulnerable to deformation
[1:54:53] it may still deform when exposed to
[1:54:57] another enough stress
[1:54:59] vulcanized rubber won't deform as easily
[1:55:01] as conventional non-vulcanized rubber
[1:55:03] that's why Brothers used that word
[1:55:07] we were non-vulcanized rubber now we are
[1:55:10] vulcanized rubber rubber also becomes
[1:55:13] harder when vulcanized which
[1:55:15] subsequently increases its strength
[1:55:19] and reduces the risk of physical damage
[1:55:24] well I thought y'all might shout about
[1:55:26] that but that's all right y'all don't
[1:55:27] shout out at all okay now I want you to
[1:55:29] read this right here
[1:55:32] unlike with thermoplastic that old junk
[1:55:34] plastic chemical processes the effects
[1:55:37] of vulcanization are permanent
[1:55:41] after a rubber eye praise God after a
[1:55:44] rubber object or material has been
[1:55:46] vulcanized it can't be reversed
[1:55:49] you vulcanized you put these things
[1:55:51] inside of you it can't be reversed
[1:55:56] become so one
[1:55:57] two Satan can't pull you apart
[1:56:00] don't you want to be that way stand to
[1:56:02] your feet God bless don't you want to be
[1:56:04] that way I'm tired of the devil beating
[1:56:07] on me deforming my Revelation deforming
[1:56:10] men in my walk with God
[1:56:14] amen but you know what vulcanization is
[1:56:17] it's not an easy process
[1:56:20] you gotta heat it to almost 300 degrees
[1:56:24] and pretty much almost melt come on
[1:56:27] somebody
[1:56:28] and pretty much melt the material
[1:56:32] you put it together
[1:56:34] and then you cool it off
[1:56:37] and you can't tell one from the other
[1:56:40] but brother Brown said now you can't
[1:56:42] take rubber
[1:56:43] and wood
[1:56:45] are rubber and metal
[1:56:48] why because they're not of the same
[1:56:49] chemical substance
[1:56:53] but if you're a child of God
[1:56:55] come on somebody if you're a child of
[1:56:57] God
[1:56:59] and you got God
[1:57:01] and he Heats you up a little bit
[1:57:03] he vulcanizes these
[1:57:06] uh virtues in you
[1:57:09] sister Regina There's No Going Back
[1:57:12] there's no reverse in God there's no
[1:57:13] reverse in vulcanization you can't
[1:57:16] unvalkonize that rubber
[1:57:19] it becomes one piece and it becomes look
[1:57:21] it becomes harder and stronger
[1:57:25] harder and stronger that's why brother
[1:57:27] Brown used that word vulcanization
[1:57:30] it's because he knew what he was talking
[1:57:31] about because back when we did have to
[1:57:34] balkanize we had to take patches and put
[1:57:36] patches on rubber patches on a hole in a
[1:57:39] tire right
[1:57:41] for a lot of you that are that are older
[1:57:44] and what did you do you hated it
[1:57:47] right and it just melted into each other
[1:57:49] and it was so much that it was stronger
[1:57:50] than what was before
[1:57:53] let's be stronger
[1:57:55] than what we were before
[1:57:57] let's be I work listen we're all rubber
[1:57:59] come on we're all rubber
[1:58:02] we're all human
[1:58:04] but God's God
[1:58:06] and if you got the baptism the holy
[1:58:08] ghost in your soul
[1:58:09] if God's remember your rubber
[1:58:12] he is kind of rubber
[1:58:16] so let him bring the heat
[1:58:19] let him bring the heat
[1:58:22] and melt me into him
[1:58:25] I don't want to be me no more
[1:58:29] melt me into him to where when you see
[1:58:32] rubber if that's God you see me if you
[1:58:35] see me you see the god you see that
[1:58:38] rubber there's not a differentiation
[1:58:40] there's not a twoness it all becomes one
[1:58:44] and you can't tell the difference
[1:58:46] let's bow our heads just for a second
[1:58:50] or know we've been long a little bit
[1:58:53] but I believe we brought out some pretty
[1:58:55] good points today
[1:58:56] and I sure appreciate you
[1:58:59] sitting and listening but I want to with
[1:59:01] your heads bowing your eyes closed
[1:59:04] if anybody here
[1:59:07] wants to be vulcanized
[1:59:10] ever head bowed every eye closed
[1:59:15] if you want to be vulcanized just lift
[1:59:17] your hand up and say God please
[1:59:19] vulcanize me
[1:59:21] from this day forward Lord make me
[1:59:22] different
[1:59:25] but make me you
[1:59:28] Lord that's just a analogy that man has
[1:59:32] of vulcanization but
[1:59:34] I believe you put it on a prophet's mind
[1:59:37] to tell the people
[1:59:39] that we don't need to just be like you
[1:59:42] we need to be you
[1:59:44] we don't need to be be like rubber we
[1:59:46] need to be that rubber by vulcanization

[2:02:25] and Lord it will be what you want us to
[2:02:28] be and you not be
[2:02:30] sad with us and Lord you'll be glad

[2:04:42] bring it with the sweetness of God down
[2:04:45] to a low voice and be able to talk as
[2:04:47] human beings and get things done I know

[2:04:59] have changed in that office Lord you

[2:05:59] get that thing out of you okay the
[2:06:02] heavenly father Lord our sister stands
[2:06:04] here today Lord
[2:06:05] I believe with a sincerity Lord that she
[2:06:09] wants to get rid of all this junk that
[2:06:10] she has
[2:06:12] her life now I'm praying the name of the
[2:06:13] Lord Jesus that you would touch our
[2:06:15] sister Lord with the fire the cold that
[2:06:17] came off of the altar Lord
[2:06:18] that the Angels brought to Isaiah and
[2:06:20] the different ones Lord and placed those
[2:06:22] coals on her lips
[2:06:26] but Lord you touched him before I pray
[2:06:28] Lord that you touch our sister Lord and
[2:06:31] as you touch her Lord and in her life
[2:06:32] and then the only things even the
[2:06:34] thoughts in the Bible will be turned
[2:06:36] towards you Lord and those things that
[2:06:38] are bothering her will not bother her
[2:06:40] anymore Lord burn her with fire lord for
[2:06:42] the Holy Ghost Lord just give her a
[2:06:44] refilling father just bless her now Lord
[2:06:46] take care of Lord in our life father we
[2:06:49] pray Lord in the name of Jesus Amen okay
[2:06:53] [Music]
[2:06:58] let's sing out again
[2:07:00] [Music]
[2:07:14] oh no no no no
[2:07:18] time
[2:07:23] [Music]
[2:07:38] the Prince of Peace
[2:07:40] the Mighty God
[2:07:42] the Everlasting father
[2:07:45] your father
[2:07:46] my father
[2:07:49] rubber to rubber
[2:07:51] let's vulcanize with him
[2:07:53] because you know what when you vulcanize
[2:07:54] there's nothing in between
[2:07:57] because it all becomes woman our problem
[2:07:59] is is we let that little
[2:08:02] air of Doubt or a little bit of you know
[2:08:06] when we had to vulcanize if you'll
[2:08:08] remember we have to clean that Pat you
[2:08:10] have to clean that piece of rubber off
[2:08:12] if it was any little piece Speck of dirt
[2:08:13] it would vulcanize because you got a
[2:08:16] different substance between
[2:08:18] but I love that song nothing between my
[2:08:21] soul and my savior nothing when you get
[2:08:25] that thing cleaned off like today we got
[2:08:27] it cleaned off
[2:08:29] now let God 300 degrees 3000 degrees let
[2:08:34] him burn that out of us and then
[2:08:36] vulcanize us right together
[2:08:38] and let us be the people that we're
[2:08:41] supposed to be walk with God don't walk
[2:08:44] with the devil walk with God in your
[2:08:46] life
[2:08:47] give him first preeminence and I'll
[2:08:50] promise you I'll promise you he'll have
[2:08:53] to come on the scene because you have to
[2:08:55] do what the word his word says he can't
[2:08:57] do something different than what he
[2:08:59] promised
[2:09:00] and
[2:09:01] you just gotta hold on when we get to
[2:09:03] Temperance then we get to patience that
[2:09:04] you gotta hold on
[2:09:05] hold on
[2:09:07] patience with God first huh
[2:09:11] [Music]
[2:09:16] no
[2:09:17] no
[2:09:18] no anything between those two pieces of
[2:09:21] rubber wouldn't work
[2:09:24] see you couldn't you couldn't put like
[2:09:25] you couldn't feel the tube full of
[2:09:28] air
[2:09:30] number one it had a hole in it but
[2:09:32] number two it was deformed and you
[2:09:34] couldn't you had to get all the air out
[2:09:38] somebody say Amen you got to get
[2:09:42] Sanctified you got to get cleaned and
[2:09:44] set aside for service then vulcanize and
[2:09:47] put you in service then there's nothing
[2:09:49] man I did he used to take that he'd take
[2:09:51] sandpaper and all kind of stuff and he'd
[2:09:53] he'd do that and he'd rub it off and
[2:09:55] he'd take that passion he'd he'd take um
[2:09:57] the uh the glue then back then you can't
[2:10:00] buy that now because well they were
[2:10:02] sniffing it but the glue sorry they were
[2:10:05] they the chemical in that glue would
[2:10:07] catch on fire
[2:10:09] so you'd rub that glue right don't you
[2:10:11] you put that glue on there and then you
[2:10:13] take them you take a match and you hit
[2:10:15] that but he goes and it burns just a
[2:10:17] pretty blue flame it just burned burn
[2:10:19] until it got hot then you took the patch
[2:10:21] and you did the same thing and then you
[2:10:22] went
[2:10:24] and you just held it there for a little
[2:10:26] while you didn't go ahead and you didn't
[2:10:30] you waited till it ever bit got
[2:10:32] vulcanized
[2:10:33] to where no air could get out
[2:10:37] to where Satan can't get in
[2:10:40] and God can't get out
[2:10:43] and that patch was Stronger
[2:10:45] because you really would never have a
[2:10:47] hole there ever again you might have a
[2:10:48] hole in them in the original rubber tire
[2:10:50] somewhere else but that that's double
[2:10:54] that's two pieces of of rubber together
[2:10:56] right bro
[2:10:59] so you and I
[2:11:01] may get a hole every once in a while
[2:11:03] somewhere else but guess what go back
[2:11:06] through that vulcanization process
[2:11:08] and let the fire god burn that thing out
[2:11:10] of you you love the Lord man I love God
[2:11:14] more and more every day because I look
[2:11:16] in you and and you see more of him
[2:11:17] somewhere
[2:11:18] in what you do and we have faults and
[2:11:21] failures we have junk that we that we've
[2:11:24] uh fall off the wagon every once in a
[2:11:26] while you might say but not like the
[2:11:27] world does but we just kind of get
[2:11:29] dilatory and we kind of get to where we
[2:11:31] don't think about things in God I think
[2:11:33] the same here
[2:11:35] foreign
[2:11:36] but let's always make sure we come back
[2:11:38] to the place we were
[2:11:40] come back to the place we were brother
[2:11:42] Brown said brother Brown said uh told
[2:11:44] the story about the about the soldier
[2:11:48] he was dying
[2:11:50] older man he was dying
[2:11:53] and the priest run to him and said I
[2:11:55] said what can I do what can I do and
[2:11:57] somebody said well uh the thought came
[2:11:59] to the to the priest's mind to the
[2:12:01] preacher's mind he said he said hurry
[2:12:03] son go back to where you left God
[2:12:07] you know what the soldier said now I lay
[2:12:09] me down to sleep
[2:12:11] I pray the Lord my soul to keep if I
[2:12:14] should die before I wake
[2:12:16] I pray the Lord my soul to take he had
[2:12:18] left him as a young kid but you know
[2:12:20] what he found him
[2:12:22] he went back to the spot come by every
[2:12:24] one of us come back to the spot where
[2:12:26] where we left him
[2:12:28] he'll leave us we left him remember
[2:12:30] remember his mama and daddy left him
[2:12:37] for three days
[2:12:40] but where was he he was in the temple
[2:12:43] doing what he's supposed to do they the
[2:12:45] ones that lost him brother Brown said
[2:12:46] they lost him at Pentecost so that's
[2:12:49] what they locked him man they lost him
[2:12:50] in Pentecost it was the Feast of
[2:12:51] Pentecost that's why they were in
[2:12:53] Jerusalem and Jesus was there in the
[2:12:54] temple at 13 years old confounded in the
[2:12:57] scholars why because he had knowledge
[2:12:59] he had knowledge
[2:13:00] and that's the same knowledge listen let
[2:13:02] this mind be in you
[2:13:06] can we believe that
[2:13:07] let this mind be in you which is also in
[2:13:10] Christ Jesus
[2:13:14] let this mind
[2:13:15] be in you
[2:13:17] just like the mind of Christ that means
[2:13:18] you got to think like him yeah that's
[2:13:20] what it says
[2:13:22] Paul says we have the mind of Christ
[2:13:25] the good
[2:13:27] the bad
[2:13:30] the human part's going to be the bad
[2:13:32] but God's never going to be bad to you
[2:13:34] he's going to give you the desire of
[2:13:36] your heart if you'll ask him as mom said
[2:13:38] today she was looking for some stuff and
[2:13:41] found it just like that we were looking
[2:13:43] for some tables last night or they were
[2:13:45] for to put in office to put a new
[2:13:47] printer on and and they didn't have
[2:13:50] nothing and all of a sudden two seconds
[2:13:51] later Mama said Mama said you know ask
[2:13:53] for big things so she said Lord we need
[2:13:55] table well God just rolled about six of
[2:13:58] them out on a
[2:13:59] from Goodwill they rolled them out from
[2:14:01] the back right there
[2:14:04] Richard jumped on them
[2:14:06] kept anybody else from buying them he
[2:14:08] just laid across them said Don't Touch
[2:14:10] This leave it a little Temperance no
[2:14:13] patience put a little tempers so we got
[2:14:15] them for like 30 bucks so I mean we
[2:14:17] asked not I mean we have not because
[2:14:18] what
[2:14:19] we asked not you say ask for tables
[2:14:23] why not
[2:14:25] why not
[2:14:27] ask for those things
[2:14:29] I don't know if I well guess what
[2:14:34] brother Brown said he said why ask for
[2:14:36] little things he said ask for big things
[2:14:41] [Music]
[2:14:42] yes oh yeah they got the time and the
[2:14:45] tables are here they're not here but
[2:14:46] they're home but got what they asked for
[2:14:50] so he's a prayer answering God if we'll
[2:14:52] just ask him
[2:14:54] and not ask him a mess not ask him
[2:14:56] because of our own
[2:15:00] our own for our own self gain
[2:15:03] but to help somebody else you just ask
[2:15:05] God
[2:15:07] ask God just keep asking him
[2:15:10] just keep asking him keep asking him
[2:15:14] somewhere that somewhere it's going to
[2:15:17] match
[2:15:19] when we get all these things out of our
[2:15:20] life
