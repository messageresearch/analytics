[2:05] anything to join any parts of doing that
[2:07] way we're just part of the body of
[2:09] Christ amen if you'd like turn in your
[2:11] scriptures where we've been reading from
[2:13] Hebrews
[2:15] 11 and we'll try to get right into our
[2:18] thoughts and remember the sick ones and
[2:20] all remember brother Gary's been having
[2:22] a lot of trouble so just pray that the
[2:24] Lord would would reach down and touch
[2:26] him and take care of those things that's
[2:28] bothering him and all
[2:30] he sounds good but yet he's still having
[2:32] a lot of troubles and all with the the
[2:35] different things and uh let's see
[2:38] remember also this coming Saturday will
[2:41] be the Bible study so remember 6 o' this
[2:44] coming Saturday all right Hebrews 11
[2:47] Heavenly Father we thank you for all the
[2:50] things that you've given unto us and
[2:51] your love and your grace that you've
[2:53] bestowed upon us in the days that you
[2:56] would save our souls that you'd fill us
[2:59] with your love and an understanding that
[3:01] you would guide us into the opening of
[3:03] Thy word that we could be able to see
[3:06] the day and the hour that we're living
[3:08] the time that we are here and Lord to Le
[3:12] look at that then that's the joy of of
[3:14] it all is to find who we are and what
[3:16] we're doing we love you and we thank you
[3:18] now we commit everything to you touch
[3:21] each one remember Brother Gary there
[3:22] Lord and touch him and take care of the
[3:24] problems and all Let Your Grace be
[3:26] sufficient in Jesus name amen
[3:30] now we've been reading this for quite a
[3:32] while
[3:33] so maybe you ought to be able to
[3:35] memorize this scripture Hebrews 11 we'll
[3:38] read 1 through two and then we'll jump
[3:40] over to five in verse 6 for the thought
[3:43] tonight now Faith is the substance of
[3:45] things hope for the evidence of Things
[3:47] Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a
[3:51] good report now that's what we're doing
[3:53] right taking the elders to see their
[3:55] report through faith we understand that
[3:57] the worlds were framed by the word of
[3:59] God so that things which are seen were
[4:02] not made of things which do appear all
[4:05] right by faith Noah we on verse five was
[4:09] translated that he should not see death
[4:12] and was not found because God had
[4:14] translated him for before his
[4:17] translation he had this testimony that
[4:20] he pleased God all right I hope we get
[4:22] over to this but to make sure we get the
[4:25] insert that Paul makes relating to us
[4:28] but without faith it is is impossible to
[4:30] please him for he that cometh to God
[4:33] must believe that he is and that he is a
[4:36] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[4:39] Him you may be seated Lord at his
[4:41] Blessing to the reading of the word
[4:45] now you know our brother uh brother Hunt
[4:49] he's done a an extended uh documentary
[4:53] on brother brandham so it's not a new
[4:56] thing to him but what we say brother
[4:57] brandham this or whatever and uh so he
[5:00] studied that and uh you know and I'm
[5:04] sure he's seen all of the fallacies that
[5:07] has been written about him I'm sure he
[5:09] could probably tell you all of the
[5:11] things were that is written that a lot
[5:13] of people believe he was God you know
[5:16] and then all kind of infallibility and
[5:19] things that they tried to attack on to
[5:22] doings and all of the fanaticism that
[5:25] goes with it but the only thing that I
[5:27] would ask him to do is to think about if
[5:30] he read a documentary or made a
[5:32] documentary point on Martin Luther he
[5:35] would find a lot of those things in the
[5:37] days of Martin Luther the days of John
[5:40] Wesley uh if you wrote a documentary on
[5:43] him you would find a lot of fanaticism
[5:45] and things and all but the main thing is
[5:48] is to um go through all of that and come
[5:52] out of it with the understanding that we
[5:55] do not believe that he was God no way
[5:58] because that would be getting into the
[6:00] wrong Point all right we believe that
[6:03] God used the man just as I believe God
[6:06] used Martin Luther I firmly believe in
[6:09] the just shall live by faith all right a
[6:12] firm believer in the the Methodist
[6:15] Doctrine now not the fanaticisms that
[6:17] goes around but the doctrine of
[6:19] sanctification because I believe in that
[6:21] I believe you you need to have a daily
[6:23] sanctification even after you're born
[6:26] again Paul said I Die daily see all
[6:29] right then the Baptist would come along
[6:31] with the bringing some of the Eternal
[6:33] Securities and the predestination and
[6:35] the things back and I believe that it's
[6:38] like I've told you John Smith the former
[6:41] the founder of the Baptist he prayed so
[6:43] much for the sins of the people his wife
[6:45] would have to lead him to The Breakfast
[6:46] Table to feed him you know because he
[6:48] was a great sinere man we're not against
[6:50] any church system not against the
[6:53] Catholics not against anything I'm
[6:56] against the system of it yeah because
[6:58] the system is what leads you away not
[7:00] the people all right they have made
[7:03] their doctrines and ideas and that's L I
[7:05] said and I don't whatsoever don't hold
[7:08] no problems with saying that the biggest
[7:10] portion of the people who follow the end
[7:12] time as we call it message have already
[7:15] denominated and and doing the same thing
[7:17] all the others has done all right and
[7:20] and that's you know that's always been
[7:23] that way but I just ask him to think
[7:26] about you know the things he heard the
[7:29] man had taught and then if he has any
[7:32] problems with that to come and ask us
[7:34] and we'll try our best to express it you
[7:37] know into human terminologies and all
[7:40] but the main thing that to me that has
[7:43] always caught me is was that he could
[7:46] bring us the word into the simple form
[7:49] that we
[7:51] could believe it it was for
[7:54] us you know I mean I always tried to
[7:58] believe in a real God you know as a kid
[8:00] and coming down but I I just from what
[8:04] people taught in the churches and the
[8:06] things we you couldn't find that God but
[8:09] you know when I begin to hear this man
[8:11] in the end time expressing the word of
[8:13] God then I said but hey and that's one
[8:16] of the one that I want to listen to and
[8:19] and we thank God for the truth in all in
[8:22] the hour that we're living all right but
[8:26] now remember our point of what we've
[8:28] been talking about
[8:31] about nobody in the Bible ever amounted
[8:34] to anything nobody all the way through
[8:37] unless they had a very positive attitude
[8:41] and that's the point that I've been
[8:42] trying to get us to have for a long time
[8:46] is a positive attitude about things all
[8:48] right and something real nobody has ever
[8:51] amounted to anything unless they had
[8:53] something personal with
[8:56] God see as I've always said about Martin
[8:59] Luther there's no telling how many times
[9:01] that he preached that J shall live by
[9:03] faith no telling how many documentaries
[9:05] he made on he was a great Theologian you
[9:07] know he probably make great uh speeches
[9:10] about it but one day God dropped down
[9:13] into his
[9:15] heart and see the Catholic Church wasn't
[9:17] afraid of
[9:19] him until it dropped into his heart then
[9:22] when it dropped into his heart they
[9:23] still wouldn't afraid of him because he
[9:25] was only one man but when he began to
[9:28] get to people to see what he was talking
[9:32] about they became excited about this man
[9:35] that was turning the world upside down
[9:37] and that's more down see in our time let
[9:39] alone back in the others but see I
[9:43] believe in having a personal experience
[9:46] with God I believe every person must
[9:48] have that you know no matter what mama
[9:51] daddy is brother sister whatever is we
[9:54] must have a personal experience of our
[9:56] own and something we can stand on right
[10:00] and in the hour of trouble it'll hold us
[10:03] whereas if it won't until that point but
[10:05] that's that's what I'm trying to get us
[10:07] to see is to look in the
[10:10] Bible see those that Paul would use and
[10:15] say that in verse two there that the
[10:17] elders obtained a good
[10:20] report you know uh they became a great
[10:23] witness they had a great testimony it
[10:26] was something that an experience they
[10:28] had cuz all of those are what the word
[10:30] report means see it's something you live
[10:33] through all right and an experience
[10:37] of finding the same God that Paul
[10:42] knew all right the same one that walked
[10:46] the shores of Galilee that we call the
[10:48] Lord Jesus
[10:50] Christ to have a personal experience of
[10:53] that and the then be as uh what we spoke
[10:57] of a second ago then you know Paul said
[10:59] one day he said follow me as I follow
[11:02] Christ well that's the way we follow
[11:04] brother brandom but you know I also
[11:07] Follow by believing it I follow Martin
[11:09] Luther's doctrine of the just you live
[11:11] by faith right I follow that because I
[11:15] believe that I'm a firm believer in
[11:17] anchoring into these and each Church
[11:19] system if you've done a documentary on
[11:22] to each one you would find their their
[11:25] beginners at a very uh profound effect
[11:29] upon mankind with what God had spoke to
[11:33] them about and I believe that you know
[11:36] all right I just believe that we've got
[11:38] to go on now and it's got to continue
[11:41] and and take you and I off the Earth one
[11:43] day somebody's going to walk off the
[11:46] earth in a Rapture all right now the
[11:48] Enoch we're going to speak of tonight
[11:50] see he was not because God took him all
[11:54] right see then there's something
[11:56] happened to him that brought him to a
[11:59] place that he could just walk off the
[12:01] earth all right then you know we'll take
[12:05] that point of looking at him as he made
[12:09] a
[12:10] report now I I want to know the report
[12:12] he
[12:15] made all right that that's that's my
[12:18] point I want to know the report he made
[12:20] because we went through Abel that di
[12:24] because it speaks of him in the fourth
[12:25] verse that Abel made a report one day
[12:28] that God was
[12:31] real because he offered the right
[12:36] sacrifice all right he believed in a
[12:39] real God not just a god of of uh trees
[12:43] and flowers and fruits and things he saw
[12:47] that it was
[12:50] blood he saw that God had when when his
[12:54] mama and daddy had sinned he saw that
[12:58] God didn't go out and get flowers they
[12:59] tried it with fig leaves you
[13:02] remember and what would be the
[13:04] difference in fig leaves or oak trees or
[13:06] pomegranates or apples or whatever it
[13:09] wouldn't work on anything if it'd work
[13:10] on one thing it' work on anything else
[13:12] all right but see Abel Knew by
[13:17] revelation God had spoken to him in his
[13:20] heart by Revelation but why didn't Cain
[13:24] see that it's my
[13:26] point I mean even after he had uh argued
[13:30] with his brother God comes down and
[13:33] talks to him talks to Cain this is not a
[13:38] an outlandish thing that you know that
[13:40] so sinful to no he was a he's a very
[13:44] sincere person he come and offered his
[13:46] sacrifice he done all the things but yet
[13:48] he was confused but why couldn't he look
[13:51] back and see as I brought out Sunday
[13:53] that you know there abble was he could
[13:57] look back and he could say mama
[13:59] and Daddy what happened back there and
[14:02] theyd say well when we sinned uh God
[14:05] made skins for
[14:07] us well then he knew it was blood would
[14:11] be the only atonement because if blood
[14:13] was the atonement there not a bunch of
[14:15] flowers or fruit or whatever you want to
[14:17] call it you know but to believe it see
[14:20] and doing it all right now in getting
[14:22] that straight we see that that Abel had
[14:25] a
[14:27] revelation had faith faith is a
[14:30] revelation all right and we've just read
[14:32] here and we keep reading it in verse one
[14:34] for the purpose because it says faith is
[14:37] the
[14:38] substance back up in verse 38 of the
[14:41] chapter above you'll find that that's a
[14:43] discussion that Paul is making and he
[14:46] says that the just shall live by
[14:49] faith then he precedes in the 11th
[14:52] chapter to explain what faith is it's
[14:56] the substance of things hopeful
[14:59] are all right it's the evidence of
[15:02] Things Not Seen so whatever would ever
[15:05] come into being would have to be brought
[15:07] into being We Believe by the creative
[15:10] act of almighty God right all right and
[15:14] where would God bring that
[15:18] from remember he created it it was the
[15:21] word that created it so then faith is a
[15:24] revelation of the word of God all right
[15:27] so then Luther caught the just shall
[15:28] live by faith when it was revealed into
[15:31] his heart see then he didn't care what
[15:34] went on You
[15:37] Realize by him going out to do that they
[15:40] was going to excommunicate him and by
[15:43] excommunicating him and then it that
[15:45] mean he's
[15:46] lost that was what it meant back there
[15:49] if you didn't stay with that you lost
[15:51] they excommunicated you all right but
[15:53] see he knew
[15:55] then Luther knew that there was
[15:58] something real that's what I'm trying to
[16:01] get you and I to talk about a real
[16:05] God not mythologies or thoughts or
[16:08] imaginations or or forms is God real to
[16:15] you or is it just what mama told you
[16:17] daddy told you somebody told
[16:20] you remember the Bible says no man can
[16:23] call Jesus the Christ except what except
[16:26] it be by the Holy Ghost by the new birth
[16:29] right all right something personal to
[16:32] you outside of that you're saying what
[16:34] somebody else
[16:36] says you're only talking about the God
[16:39] of somebody else but when it drops into
[16:41] your heart you got something
[16:45] real and see that real thing will always
[16:49] tie to the word of
[16:52] God see so Abel by
[16:57] Revelation he saw
[17:00] the very coming
[17:02] Messiah because that's what he was
[17:04] speaking of in his
[17:07] sacrifice right his sacrifice was
[17:10] speaking of the coming Messiah all right
[17:13] now as we go on over into doing it then
[17:17] my point has been to what take these
[17:19] elders and their report and see what it
[17:23] means to you and I all right but to see
[17:27] that Abel see spoke of the coming
[17:31] Messiah all
[17:33] right you know it's not mentioned about
[17:37] Enoch offering sacrifices and I believe
[17:40] he did okay don't don't go wrong on me
[17:43] now but I mean it's not emphasized about
[17:46] the
[17:46] sacrifices in Enoch and his doing it
[17:51] emphasized that he pleased God that's it
[17:55] all right now so then I want to know I
[17:59] believe I know how Abel had a personal
[18:03] revelation that it was blood and
[18:05] speaking of the coming Messiah right
[18:07] good all right but now remember
[18:12] Enoch by not
[18:15] dying and walking off the Earth he was
[18:19] the type of the Rapture of the Bride to
[18:21] come in the end time all right now Noah
[18:25] we'll get to it later when we're
[18:26] studying it Noah raises up rides over
[18:29] comes back down he's a type of the
[18:31] tribulation Saints and the people of
[18:33] doing those things it each one has a
[18:36] place and an order of what's doing but
[18:39] the main point to Enoch is
[18:42] what he pleased
[18:46] God now see we say within our own hearts
[18:49] and lives well that's my
[18:54] desire is to please
[18:56] God but you know that Paul is a good to
[18:59] it in a little while Paul in Romans 8
[19:01] and8 I believe it
[19:03] is he said no flesh can please
[19:11] God see now then what is the point that
[19:14] we want to
[19:18] take I believe
[19:22] now that Enoch could look
[19:27] back and see
[19:29] see what Abel had and believed
[19:34] it he believed Abel had a revelation of
[19:36] God you know a real to spoke of the
[19:40] coming Messiah so then Enoch is not
[19:42] going to speak of the coming
[19:44] Messiah so it doesn't speak about an
[19:47] offering tied in with him it speaks of
[19:51] the pleasing
[19:53] God all right now as I said don't
[19:55] misunderstand me I believe Enoch offered
[19:58] sacrifices those all of them did they
[20:01] were commanded to do all right but the
[20:04] emphasis I'm trying to make is that you
[20:07] look at something and you see the
[20:09] revealed word that shows you the
[20:11] Messiah all right then you look at the
[20:15] next one that it speaks
[20:17] of and the next one that Paul chooses to
[20:21] use is
[20:26] eno and it says that he please
[20:30] God all right then he makes an insert
[20:33] which is not speaking of necessarily
[20:37] Enoch or anything else it's speaking of
[20:38] you and I he makes an insert there with
[20:41] the sixth verse and he says but without
[20:44] faith it's impossible to believe God
[20:46] because he that cometh to God must
[20:48] believe that he is he not was you
[20:53] know not the god of Grandma Grandpa
[20:56] Daddy's God the preacher's God
[20:59] right must believe that he
[21:01] is and a rewarder of them that
[21:04] diligently seek him all right so he
[21:07] makes that
[21:08] insert to show us what faith really
[21:12] is all
[21:13] right see it is the
[21:17] substance of what anything consists of
[21:21] as I say I can hold within my hand
[21:24] enough atoms to blow the world
[21:26] up but there's no way that I can do
[21:29] anything with that but through the
[21:31] process of science they've been able to
[21:34] take that and bringing it from the
[21:36] original substance that it existed as to
[21:39] looking like nothing bringing it out and
[21:42] make an atom
[21:44] bomb from something that you can't
[21:47] see all right I like the way the prophet
[21:51] said one day he said let's get God's
[21:52] Adam Bomb Faith because that's a great
[21:54] thing is Faith because faith will
[21:57] conquer all things don't worry about it
[21:59] that's right who was it wasn't it Martin
[22:02] Luther or one of the men said they said
[22:04] I believe it's Luther they said they we
[22:06] want you to know that the world's
[22:07] against you he said I want the world to
[22:08] know I'm against them that's
[22:11] right he had something real and and that
[22:14] way he didn't he wasn't
[22:17] afraid if you're afraid of what you
[22:20] believe then you don't believe very much
[22:23] all
[22:26] right if you're afraid about it but see
[22:30] Enoch then could
[22:33] look and look and see Abel in what
[22:39] happened all right and then he could
[22:42] stand there upon that but see that was
[22:45] not the thing that Enoch was to do was
[22:49] to believe in the god of
[22:52] Abel
[22:54] right the experience of Abel that's good
[22:56] to talk about other people's experience
[22:58] and tell about them wonderful you
[23:02] know I mean the people of this message
[23:05] are wonderful of talking about how that
[23:07] brother Brandon went around the world
[23:08] seven times there was so many dead
[23:10] raised and all like that I believe it
[23:13] all right you know why I believe it
[23:14] because I've seen the dead rais I ain't
[23:16] been around the world but I've been a
[23:18] little bit all but you see I believe
[23:22] it but Enoch had something to stand on
[23:25] to look back at Abel
[23:29] that's the whole point I want you to
[23:30] follow me throughout the line as we use
[23:33] it coming through these Warriors of
[23:36] faith is to see each one of them could
[23:39] look back and see the other and line up
[23:42] and then here today we can take it as I
[23:44] was trying to show Sunday see I can take
[23:47] what I believe about one true and living
[23:49] God and take it all the way back through
[23:51] the Bible through all of the Patriarchs
[23:54] who met that God through all of the
[23:56] writers through all of the prophets who
[23:58] spoke of that God and go right back to
[24:00] the Garden of Eden and see the very God
[24:03] that killed those animals but I can't
[24:05] take can
[24:08] fruit whatever you want to make
[24:11] it I just get the belly ache out of
[24:14] apples and that's not a joke it's
[24:20] truth you see people before us have
[24:23] already walked on these
[24:26] things as we'll read in a minute where
[24:28] says that and we've already read but
[24:31] we'll emphasize a little Enoch walk with
[24:36] god well have you ever read a little bit
[24:39] about
[24:41] Noah you know that Noah walked with
[24:44] God but now brother Dale he only
[24:46] represents this but he had to represent
[24:51] that but is the god of Enoch greater
[24:54] than the god of
[24:56] Noah oh now you're getting in the wrong
[24:58] way it's examples and things that are
[25:01] said in the Bible to preed to show
[25:04] us all
[25:06] right he not trying to make a little God
[25:09] here and a big God there all right but
[25:12] are you listening to
[25:14] me see when Enoch looked at the
[25:20] report of
[25:23] Abel and he knew what he had tried to
[25:27] make a report of
[25:29] or was doing in his
[25:30] life was
[25:33] real and see if you can't look back and
[25:36] see the ones prior to you in their
[25:40] Revelation and see that it lines up
[25:42] there's only one revelation of God see
[25:44] that's why you can't go back into church
[25:47] allies and get this Doctrine and get
[25:49] that Doctrine are brandom doctrines
[25:52] romit as we call them today that's got
[25:55] this Doctrine and that Doctrine and all
[25:56] kind of flying doctrines
[25:59] all right but we can look in the word of
[26:01] God and see whether it fits or not all
[26:04] right now and to do that then think
[26:07] about what I'm
[26:09] saying because see we're going to we're
[26:11] going to get into something in some uh
[26:13] take out some thoughts that are in
[26:15] people's mind as we go along you know
[26:18] that brother brandham would say uh that
[26:26] uh Noah
[26:30] dra
[26:36] Enoch and seen him leave and he started
[26:39] building an
[26:42] ark well you said well that can't be
[26:46] true cuz it's too much time wise but see
[26:49] you're not listening to what the man
[26:50] says you're only trying to make
[26:53] everything fit together amen
[26:59] brother Ren will say
[27:01] Noah walk with God for f uh Enoch walked
[27:04] with God for 500 years he was only 365
[27:07] years
[27:13] old but see if you know what you're
[27:15] talking
[27:22] about you don't worry about it do
[27:24] you well he was wrong here and he was
[27:27] wrong there he was a human being but you
[27:29] know sometimes the wrongs might you to
[27:32] think about him it might be saying
[27:34] something uh I'm 74 years old but you
[27:37] know I walk with God before the
[27:38] foundation of the
[27:40] world according to the
[27:46] scripture remember when the morning
[27:48] Stars Sayang together and the sons of
[27:49] God shouted for Joy if you have the new
[27:51] birth in your heart tonight that new
[27:53] birth was back there not you as people
[27:56] come on so was brother Rand
[27:59] off or was he saying things that maybe
[28:03] for us that we need to
[28:05] listen and
[28:08] see so what would be the difference in
[28:10] Noah's walk and Enoch's
[28:16] walk in the typologies you're typing one
[28:19] is the bride and the other is a foolish
[28:21] virgin in wordings you're saying that
[28:24] Noah rose up went over and come back
[28:26] down Enoch went off
[28:29] but you remember Elijah went off in a
[28:33] chariot you
[28:35] know all right that's what I'm saying in
[28:39] we take the word but the main thing I'm
[28:41] wanting us to do is to see what is
[28:44] relation to you and
[28:46] I that's it all right amen see then if I
[28:51] can find out how Enoch walked with God
[28:54] and pleased him if I walked that way
[29:00] are you
[29:02] listening if I can find that walk
[29:05] Brother Ray and just walk that
[29:09] way I wish old brother fory was here got
[29:12] this black brother he's really good at
[29:14] that black man's walk you know that's a
[29:16] strut you know the way they and you
[29:20] you'd get a good life cuz that's the way
[29:21] he'd say we just got to walk out way
[29:25] but I'm just want to know how
[29:28] Enoch
[29:33] walked because if I can find out how he
[29:36] walked I might be able to find out how I
[29:37] need to
[29:39] walk right if he gave a report and his
[29:43] report
[29:45] was that he please
[29:48] God all right now think about it first
[29:51] off let's get a few things out of the
[29:53] way in the
[29:54] natural Enoch's name in the first I told
[29:57] you other day that you were to go read
[29:59] the Bible if you'd read the Bible you'd
[30:01] find out a few things see because you a
[30:03] lot of people read the Bible and they
[30:04] grab up the Bible you tell them
[30:05] something they grab up the Bible they
[30:06] read it and they read
[30:09] Enoch the first Enoch was direct
[30:12] descended from
[30:17] Cain his first son was named
[30:22] Enoch all
[30:24] right
[30:25] now then you come along later
[30:31] and find out
[30:32] that Enoch comes from Adam down through
[30:36] Jared or how you pronounce it and that's
[30:39] the one who walked with God their names
[30:43] are identically the
[30:46] same which I think it means
[30:49] rest but think about
[30:52] it Paul was telling
[30:56] us that any
[31:00] Walk With
[31:01] God all
[31:06] right in Genesis 5 and 24 it says Enoch
[31:11] walked with God and was not for God took
[31:13] him in Hebrews 11:5 it says he was
[31:16] translated because he pleased God so
[31:20] there's no recording in the genus's
[31:23] account of how he walked or whatever it
[31:26] just says he walked
[31:28] and it was not for God took him all
[31:31] right Paul gets it by Revelation looking
[31:34] back and sees him and he knows the walk
[31:37] he
[31:40] made all right he knows the walk the man
[31:44] made and he knows how that it done
[31:47] because it pleased
[31:51] God but then he gives the secret in the
[31:53] next verse when he says it's impossible
[31:58] us to please God without having the same
[32:00] paraphrasing it without having the same
[32:04] Faith Enoch had
[32:07] right so now what's he
[32:11] saying the prophet says on the first
[32:13] seal message paragraph
[32:16] 122 he said Enoch had raptured Faith
[32:20] we're always quoting and I use it a lot
[32:21] of times I say rapturing faith but the
[32:23] technical word is raptured Faith all
[32:25] right he pleased god with raptured
[32:29] Faith all right
[32:32] now he was translated because he pleased
[32:38] God
[32:43] now I'm not making it carnal as to show
[32:46] the kind of walk you make cuz you know
[32:48] better than that whether he limped or
[32:51] whether he done you know you can go back
[32:53] in the Bible and do it you know you do
[32:54] have a Jacob there but when he became an
[32:57] Israel he walk different I mean you can
[33:00] go back into those things that's fine
[33:02] but Enoch pleased
[33:05] god with raptured
[33:09] faith
[33:16] now
[33:18] Jude
[33:20] 114 speaks of
[33:23] Enoch in a way that is not mentioned in
[33:28] Genesis are mentioned in
[33:30] Hebrews it mentions there and it says
[33:35] uh Enoch
[33:38] prophesied that the Lord was coming with
[33:41] 10,000 of his
[33:44] Saints no Enoch was a
[33:48] preacher all right you know Enoch built
[33:51] the Pyramid right everybody follow that
[33:55] he credited as the building of the one
[33:57] called chops with no Capstone on it it
[34:00] was built in the time there and they
[34:02] Creed Enoch as to building that and the
[34:04] pyramids was what a Bible in stone the
[34:07] first one was written in the heavens
[34:09] second one was written in the pyramid
[34:11] the third was written on into paper or
[34:14] you know what we call the Bible all
[34:16] right so Enoch wrote a
[34:22] Bible in building a pyramid so he had a
[34:25] good revelation
[34:30] right are you
[34:33] listening he had a good
[34:36] Revelation he had a
[34:38] great understanding of
[34:43] God what does I say it
[34:51] then do you walk by go with
[34:54] God uh
[34:58] naturally or do you walk spiritually
[34:59] with God which way is
[35:04] it you see our walk should be in faith
[35:08] or in the word of
[35:11] God not that our natural lives are not
[35:15] important but they are
[35:18] secondary right it's Faith first then
[35:22] Works see that's where Cain thought it
[35:24] was fully works so he went with his
[35:27] thought
[35:28] of it was Works he would have been all
[35:30] right had he offered the lamb first and
[35:34] then tried to appease God you remember
[35:37] how we brought that out
[35:39] Abel he offered a
[35:42] sacrifice Cain tried to
[35:45] appease all right what are we
[35:49] doing what is our Revelation right is it
[35:53] our
[35:56] goodness well according in to the Bible
[35:58] that says that our goodness is what
[36:01] filthy
[36:02] rags
[36:04] now it doesn't not mean I keep saying
[36:07] that where people won't get me wrong it
[36:09] does not mean that you're not supposed
[36:11] to live right that you just go live like
[36:14] the devil and God will take care of it
[36:16] now that's garbage can that's come down
[36:18] through organized religion and ideas of
[36:21] people all
[36:23] right but like I told you many times I'm
[36:26] not trying to get you to be good
[36:30] I'm trying to get you to be born
[36:32] again all right then if the goodness
[36:34] doesn't follow us you know if the life
[36:37] doesn't follow us walking in the word of
[36:41] God then we prove that we were not saved
[36:44] to start with that's plain language all
[36:47] right but see people that hear me talk
[36:49] and they say oh he don't believe in
[36:51] living right he believe just living like
[36:52] the devil and then God us some way
[36:54] through Grace now I didn't say that you
[36:57] get the
[36:58] idea CU I've never taught nothing like
[37:03] that remember every who's your
[37:07] master is that
[37:10] scripture you are the slave to one
[37:12] master or the
[37:14] other you're either a slave to God or
[37:16] you're either a slave to the devil the
[37:18] biggest hypocrite is one claiming to be
[37:20] slave to God and is really still a slave
[37:22] to the devil all right get that out of
[37:25] the way to where people want how the
[37:27] wrong idea about what you're saying all
[37:29] right see it's not your
[37:33] goodness that pleases
[37:37] God all
[37:40] right then it must be by
[37:47] faith it must be by the revealed
[37:53] word the word Made Alive into our hearts
[37:55] is a revealed word what I'm talking
[37:57] about
[37:59] now as I said then if it's you say it's
[38:01] revealed to you and then you go out and
[38:03] live like the devil you're a
[38:07] hypocrite you're lost the best way to
[38:10] say it if that ain't you know strong
[38:13] enough for understanding the people all
[38:15] right see Enoch walked with God because
[38:19] he believed
[38:22] God remember the emphasis Paul put when
[38:25] he inserted go he that does this must
[38:29] believe that God is and a rewarder of
[38:32] them that diligently seek him so he must
[38:35] believe
[38:36] that dooch was not one of these that was
[38:40] just halfhazard
[38:42] Le he was a good
[38:45] man right but you know what probably in
[38:48] that day there was probably a lot of
[38:50] good
[38:52] people just like
[38:55] today there's a lot of good people in
[38:57] this world
[38:59] today they go to church they serve God
[39:01] they do different thing no there's a lot
[39:05] of good people give you anything in the
[39:07] world take care of you help you do it
[39:13] whatever but we can't depend upon that
[39:15] because see works is supposed to be
[39:18] Faith
[39:22] expressed it's supposed to be an outward
[39:25] manifestation of an inward work
[39:28] what we're doing is trying to polish up
[39:30] the
[39:31] outside to make it look good and say oh
[39:34] I'm good you remember the illustration
[39:36] we gave Sunday a man standing there you
[39:38] know in prayer with the Lord Jesus
[39:40] talking about he says I fast every day I
[39:42] do this I give this I do that and Lord I
[39:45] thank you I'm not like
[39:48] him well you know he had every right to
[39:50] say what he said but he done
[39:53] it right remember he's talking to God
[39:58] God could have easily said hold it you
[40:00] didn't do that one hold it you didn't do
[40:02] that one so he didn't do it he he meant
[40:04] it and God knew that he meant it the
[40:07] other one just said father forgive
[40:10] me now which one went home the Bible
[40:12] said
[40:13] Justified all
[40:15] right so then Enoch walked upon on the
[40:21] revelation of the God that he knew was
[40:24] real
[40:27] you said but Brother D wouldn't even
[40:29] know Bible back there how could he walk
[40:31] they wouldn't know Bible back there in
[40:32] the beginning how did they will know how
[40:34] to offer
[40:36] blood it's the writing of the
[40:38] Bible
[40:40] right Enoch wrote the whole Bible in the
[40:44] pyramid so if he did then he wrote the
[40:46] whole entire book of books everything in
[40:48] the Bible was
[40:49] our and you get into pyramidology and it
[40:52] runs crazy but you get in there and
[40:54] study those things of The Upside Down
[40:56] Chambers the three blocks that block you
[40:58] from upwards to the to the Queen's
[41:00] chamber then get into the king's
[41:04] chamber there's a lot of good things in
[41:06] there but yet there's a lot of
[41:09] pyramidology that's
[41:11] crazy they claim you build a a u a milk
[41:15] carton in the form of a pyramid and the
[41:17] milk lies
[41:19] longer you know there's all kind of
[41:22] garbage cans all right they claim it was
[41:26] a space stationed to contact the aliens
[41:30] from the other countries World they got
[41:32] all kind of doctrines but now
[41:35] look as I said to start with
[41:38] Enoch he saw
[41:41] Abel as to what he was speaking
[41:45] of maybe not understanding everything or
[41:48] every form that we talk about it but yet
[41:51] he understood that
[41:53] Abel saw God as being real
[42:02] he didn't sit out then and saywell what
[42:04] I need to do now I need to make sure
[42:07] that I live right that's
[42:10] good
[42:12] wonderful praise the Lord you make a
[42:15] good
[42:17] neighbor
[42:20] right get born again and then let that
[42:23] take place and you make a Christian with
[42:25] outward manifestations of an inward work
[42:29] right
[42:35] okay so it wasn't how good he
[42:38] walked that's the emphasis I want you to
[42:40] get because it says that he pleased God
[42:48] right now I only know of one way to
[42:50] please
[42:51] God and that's to take him at his word
[42:59] and you think about that you consider
[43:00] that thought you take him at his
[43:06] word you believe his word you hold on to
[43:09] his word you walk in his
[43:13] word but see you can't take your other
[43:15] side and run it because man tries to do
[43:18] that but what are you going to do with
[43:19] David I don't have time to get into it
[43:21] we will as we get over to
[43:25] him but David was listen Ed as a man
[43:27] after God's Own
[43:29] Heart right yet he was a whoremonger an
[43:33] adulterous he was all kind of
[43:35] things man he would you wouldn't want
[43:37] him as your
[43:41] neighbor
[43:43] right you wouldn't want to live in a
[43:45] neighborhood with all the Davids in
[43:47] it as bad as they were but yet the Bible
[43:50] say he was going B after God's Own
[43:54] Heart but God said that he didn't look
[43:57] he said your sacrifice and offerings he
[43:58] said they become a stink in my nostrils
[44:00] right he said but what I Look to is an
[44:03] honest and a contrite heart so that's
[44:06] what he saw in
[44:10] David you see that's what pleased God
[44:14] was Enoch to walk now
[44:19] listen in the
[44:21] word and
[44:23] preach the gospel for his day
[44:31] because he was a preacher that's what he
[44:32] was
[44:33] doing if he prophesied of the Lord
[44:36] coming with 10,000 of his Saints that's
[44:38] just one of I said it's not listed in
[44:40] Genesis and Hebrews about that Jude
[44:42] picks it
[44:45] up and looks back and sees that Enoch
[44:49] was a
[44:52] preacher he went around trying to get
[44:55] people to see the God that he believed
[44:56] in
[44:59] don't you believe Abel spent the rest of
[45:00] his life I mean Seth picking up after
[45:03] Abel don't you think Seth picked it up
[45:06] of the same point and tried to convert
[45:08] the people to the belief that Abel had
[45:11] had and brought down to them don't you
[45:15] think Adam probably felt pretty
[45:17] bad did he produced two kids one of them
[45:20] thinking it was blood and one of them
[45:21] thinking it was
[45:23] fruit and then one of them kills the
[45:25] other one
[45:27] because of his belief in the
[45:32] blood don't you think Adam probably got
[45:34] converted as we'd call
[45:37] it to thinking about well I should have
[45:40] listened to
[45:41] Abel but I know what
[45:46] happened but my point is
[45:50] what Abel had to report or made to
[45:53] report was about him because this is
[45:55] Paul writing about these different ones
[45:58] so the report is being made is by Paul
[46:00] but he's looking back into their lives
[46:03] and expressing it to you and I right all
[46:05] right and his report
[46:09] is that he pleased
[46:15] God and I'm honest
[46:18] now I don't think Enoch was walking out
[46:21] through there with everything so much
[46:23] and thinking you know if I walk good and
[46:25] straight and I do things right God will
[46:27] just take me off the
[46:30] earth I think it was a
[46:33] surprise when he took an evening stroll
[46:37] and you know I illustrate it you
[46:39] remember how he built the Pyramid so he
[46:42] was out there walking up and maybe
[46:44] walked upside you know it pretty rough
[46:45] to start with it blocks and then they
[46:47] just made it straight but Enoch could
[46:50] have just walked up through there one
[46:51] day and got up to the top before they
[46:53] sealed it off it would have been
[46:55] possible and uh
[46:58] he just took one more
[47:03] step and he said well I don't know
[47:06] what's holding me up I'll just take one
[47:09] more you
[47:13] know see God was putting under his
[47:17] feet the substance that he
[47:20] needed to be able to
[47:23] walk now I don't think he walked up as
[47:26] we want to call it up to the universe
[47:29] because he would run out of a God would
[47:30] have had to made him a spacit you know
[47:32] going out into the outer space so it's
[47:35] really not that much anyway of trying to
[47:36] find out you know I love the way the
[47:38] prophet said he said he said those
[47:41] people sold are under the altar he said
[47:42] they're only 20 ft over there at a
[47:46] slant now Einstein would have took that
[47:49] and he said that guys knows what he's
[47:51] talking
[47:53] about heaven is not millions of miles
[47:57] off it's just another
[47:59] dimension Enoch just stepped off walked
[48:02] off went into another dimension was
[48:04] not you didn't have to walk through
[48:06] space so
[48:07] far Elijah took a chariot one day and he
[48:10] rode up
[48:12] there it's not something that we got to
[48:14] go 14 million like the the Russians said
[48:17] they went all the way to the moon and
[48:18] back said we didn't see no
[48:23] God but it didn't F to listen to the
[48:27] things it was written about some of
[48:28] those people that did go there was a
[48:30] flying object went with them you read
[48:33] the story and come
[48:35] back they just looked out the window
[48:37] they didn't know where he was at but
[48:38] it's all right listen
[48:42] folks Enoch had a positive
[48:46] attitude and he walked with God and
[48:51] preached all he knew about that
[48:55] God right
[48:58] living a good life
[49:02] yes but God was not looking at his good
[49:05] life he was
[49:08] living he doesn't look at your good
[49:12] life he looks at your
[49:16] Revelation that you have of
[49:21] him because he knows he said it there is
[49:26] none good good know not one that's the
[49:29] Lord Jesus's
[49:30] statement so humanly
[49:34] speaking what do we think Enoch walked
[49:37] so perfect oh he just Pro perfect 365
[49:42] years he never had a dirty thought he
[49:45] never said nothing wrong he never done
[49:47] nothing he just walked he just kept
[49:51] walking I don't think he'll get anywhere
[49:53] like that except tired
[50:01] and once you try to walk in the word of
[50:04] God the devil's going to be after
[50:08] you and you're going to be he's going to
[50:10] be stirred up we could get into Noah
[50:13] about that right I mean job about that
[50:16] we'll get over there eventually now that
[50:18] job you know because of him being the
[50:20] Bible says righteous
[50:23] perfect have you considered my servant
[50:25] job he's perfect
[50:30] and here comes his buddies along want to
[50:32] condemn him for being
[50:35] perfect
[50:38] right do you understand what I'm trying
[50:40] to
[50:44] say that God is not looking at our
[50:49] lives he's hearing our voice to the
[50:53] blood right you remember how we brought
[50:55] out the other day
[50:57] Abel's blood would
[51:00] speak you know Abel's blood cried out to
[51:03] God what was it it was Abel's revelation
[51:06] of
[51:07] God not his voice he was hearing out of
[51:10] there but we took him all the way down
[51:11] into paradise and brought him out of
[51:13] paradise
[51:15] right then the Bible says that the blood
[51:17] of Jesus Christ speaketh better things
[51:19] than
[51:23] this because Abel's blood could only
[51:25] speak of death and judgment and things
[51:28] but the blood of Jesus Christ speaks of
[51:29] righteousness and peace and
[51:33] salvation so I still want to hear the
[51:35] voice speaking because he's speaking by
[51:39] Revelation what are you trying to say
[51:42] what about your
[51:48] Revelation
[51:49] Enoch had the
[51:51] revelation of
[51:54] God and you know what he bypassed
[51:58] death
[52:01] right now he was there as an example but
[52:05] remember that's what all of those were
[52:07] there
[52:09] far for the hours of Salvation you and I
[52:13] to be able to come and see what it's
[52:16] speaking of he was just speaking of
[52:22] us Enoch didn't have the new birth
[52:27] that's hard to explain to people but why
[52:29] can't you see it Jesus Christ hadn't
[52:31] died at that time so there was no inward
[52:33] experience of the new birth until after
[52:39] Calvary but yet it says Enoch was not
[52:42] because God took him he said because he
[52:45] pleased
[52:48] him now how do we please
[52:51] God by walking in the word amen
[52:57] and you tell me it's anything else
[52:58] besides that where you going with
[53:00] it I've expressed it over about three
[53:03] times that if you don't walk according
[53:06] to the New Birth the soul the individual
[53:10] if we go out and live like the devil we
[53:13] still belong to the devil don't claim to
[53:15] be
[53:16] saved it it settled one time orever but
[53:19] just remember you will be tempted every
[53:23] moment every day of your life
[53:27] and don't worry about it God can take
[53:29] care of it if we walk in the
[53:33] word you remember the scripture we walk
[53:36] in the light as he is in the light we
[53:38] have Fellowship one with another and
[53:40] what and the blood of Jesus Christ
[53:43] atones for all
[53:45] sin all
[53:49] right see Enoch was preaching
[53:58] right he was preaching we're going to
[54:00] get to Noah where Noah was a preacher of
[54:07] righteousness yet he winds up when he
[54:09] gets out of the Ark and puts a Vineyard
[54:12] grow some grapes and gets
[54:16] drunk
[54:18] right dies of
[54:22] drunk but just remember
[54:27] Enoch by Revelation without even having
[54:30] the new
[54:34] birth but yet having the soul of an
[54:36] individual being is what we
[54:39] are that God could speak to
[54:42] him and he believed
[54:45] it and he went around telling people
[54:48] about the God
[54:50] that he believed
[54:54] in 300 years or so may be
[55:03] preaching and he Walking with God the
[55:05] whole
[55:09] time yet we don't believe it like that
[55:13] see we want to try to make it some
[55:15] goodness what's going to bring the
[55:17] Rapture as we call it among our ranks
[55:20] Rapture what's going to bring the
[55:22] Rapture to pass well some of these days
[55:25] somebody's going to get good enough
[55:28] well let's get our whips out we will
[55:30] start whooping each other until we all
[55:32] get to the place that we ain't going to
[55:33] do nothing dirty no
[55:34] more you think that's the way it's going
[55:36] to
[55:38] be that's your thoughts and your
[55:48] doctrines you see you can't walk with
[55:50] God on Grandma's Revelation
[55:54] right all right
[56:01] be
[56:04] Enoch no doubt lived a very good
[56:09] life
[56:12] right but his good life was not what
[56:14] pleased
[56:16] God but it was
[56:19] what he could believe God to
[56:23] be you remember the insert Paul said he
[56:25] puts in
[56:27] or it's impossible to please
[56:31] God unless you get it by
[56:36] faith you got to believe that he is not
[56:39] was see trinities won't work then
[56:43] because you got your father son Holy
[56:44] Ghost you getting all messed up so you
[56:46] got to believe that he is to believe
[56:47] that he is you believe in the one true
[56:49] and living
[56:50] God and if Eve messed up in the garden
[56:52] on Hebrews 138 what do you think Enoch
[56:54] was trying to do he was trying to to
[56:56] believe that he was the same yesterday
[56:58] today and
[56:59] forever that's what pleased
[57:04] God you know it's a pleasing thing to a
[57:07] human being I was raised in the country
[57:10] many of you told it and you know the
[57:11] stories yourself used to be a store
[57:14] right where Wade lives and a man sold
[57:18] groceries and stuff and and he worked on
[57:21] another job and raised cattle and farmed
[57:24] and done different things and and you
[57:26] you got ready to go out to the store you
[57:28] just went to the store and there wasn't
[57:29] nobody there and you just walked in and
[57:32] you got what you wanted and you just
[57:33] laid the money down on the
[57:37] counter or either you wrote it down on a
[57:39] piece of papers I Samuel Dale today got
[57:42] two cocas pay you
[57:45] later there was no locks on the homes
[57:48] there was
[57:49] nothing a man's word was his bird word
[57:53] you've heard me tell that when I sold my
[57:54] home that my
[57:56] brother offered me $5,000 profit the
[57:59] very minute I done told my nephew he
[58:01] could have a home for a set price I said
[58:04] you go talk to him you can buy it from
[58:05] him you ain't going to buy it from
[58:07] me if my word wouldn't worth $5,000 and
[58:10] $5,000
[58:12] 1972 was a lot of money still
[58:17] is what's the
[58:19] point I think we should be honest and
[58:22] straight and
[58:24] correct all right
[58:27] we should be people that want to live
[58:30] and do
[58:32] right but we order at the same time
[58:35] realize
[58:37] that Paul is inserting here it's
[58:40] impossible to please God without you
[58:43] having
[58:46] faith without you having a revelation of
[58:50] God and has he ever revealed himself to
[58:52] you are you still wondering whether
[58:54] there's three or whether there's one or
[58:56] what is the point you know well who was
[58:59] he talking to down on the River Jordan
[59:01] when the dove comes down and all are you
[59:04] still in those
[59:05] days and there's nothing pleasing to God
[59:09] about those
[59:13] ideas you see that's why we believe
[59:15] that's the way I do I believe that God
[59:17] sent us a prophet yes that brought us
[59:20] the word I believe
[59:22] that but I know he was a human and made
[59:25] human mistakes in his speech and the
[59:27] different things right but I know that
[59:31] he brought me to a deeper depth of God
[59:35] than anything I had ever studied about
[59:38] before so I follow
[59:48] that Enoch was a preacher
[59:57] you know that brother Brown said it's
[59:59] not even mentioned about Noah but yet he
[1:00:00] was a preacher but it's not mentioned
[1:00:02] about him much as preaching you know how
[1:00:04] it's mentioned he said what he built was
[1:00:07] his
[1:00:10] Revelation what Noah built was his
[1:00:16] Revelation you know what Enoch built was
[1:00:19] his Revelation he buil a
[1:00:22] pyramid placed in her all of the things
[1:00:25] that are needed
[1:00:30] a Bible in
[1:00:32] stone he preached the entire
[1:00:35] Bible how could he walk off the earth
[1:00:37] without it being the entire
[1:00:43] Bible right you said wait a minute I got
[1:00:46] you now because said The Headstone
[1:00:47] wouldn't put on no that's what caused
[1:00:49] him walk off the earth
[1:00:58] Enoch never got to put it on but he's
[1:01:00] seen
[1:01:02] it come on Jude
[1:01:06] 1:14 he said he'll come with 10,
[1:01:09] thousands of his
[1:01:11] Saints he seen what it would
[1:01:15] take to be able to make the rest of that
[1:01:20] pyramid right come on chopsy with no top
[1:01:23] put on it
[1:01:28] why did he leave the top off because
[1:01:30] there's a stone of stumbling in a rock
[1:01:31] of a fence and it had to be left off and
[1:01:33] had to come but it would have to come in
[1:01:34] the last days and what is the coming of
[1:01:37] The Headstone in the last days are they
[1:01:39] going to dig up some secret uh
[1:01:41] compartment over there somewhere and
[1:01:43] find all of these things or do something
[1:01:44] or is it to reveal word of
[1:01:49] God see I want to walk in the word
[1:01:56] and walk by what he reveals to
[1:01:59] me all
[1:02:01] right see one day I
[1:02:06] looked and a man started talking to me
[1:02:11] about the word of
[1:02:14] God and he said how many gods do you
[1:02:16] believe in I said one because that is
[1:02:19] Baptist Doctrine one true and living God
[1:02:25] that is Baptist Doctrine I was a deacon
[1:02:28] I was in the higher ranks of it and was
[1:02:30] in the well thought
[1:02:32] of at 23 years old made a
[1:02:38] deacon but he said explain your Gods I
[1:02:43] said well he's God in three persons
[1:02:44] Blessed Trinity you know cuz that's all
[1:02:47] I knew he said you're as much Trinity as
[1:02:49] anybody else I said what do you mean sir
[1:02:53] he said because of father son and and
[1:02:55] Holy Ghost is three Gods when you say a
[1:02:59] person a person is a personality
[1:03:01] personality is an individual individual
[1:03:02] is a person so you're as Trinity as
[1:03:05] anybody else and I look back at him I
[1:03:06] said I don't believe that
[1:03:08] anymore I didn't have to be fault and
[1:03:11] beat over the head and tried to convince
[1:03:13] me I knew the man had me standing
[1:03:15] against the wall as we call it in our
[1:03:16] human terminologies and I had nowhere to
[1:03:18] go cuz he planted the word of God
[1:03:29] what is your
[1:03:31] Revelation can you walk on it if there's
[1:03:34] nobody to walk with you can you walk on
[1:03:41] it or if you leave here today like some
[1:03:44] people said we I left there and said
[1:03:46] went down the church next preaching
[1:03:47] exactly what brother de
[1:03:50] preached I hope
[1:03:52] so but are you so blind you don't know
[1:03:55] what's being preached
[1:03:57] here cuz I'm not talking
[1:04:01] about the God of William Brandon come on
[1:04:07] Amen I'm talking about the Lord Jesus
[1:04:10] Christ being almighty God who lives in
[1:04:14] my heart and my life that I'm trying to
[1:04:16] tell you about and I've had a positive
[1:04:19] attitude ever since I've been in this
[1:04:23] message well now I'll tell you I I've
[1:04:25] had my downs and outs anybody want to
[1:04:28] check my record and see sure I've been
[1:04:30] through problems and heartaches and
[1:04:32] troubles and partings over doctrines and
[1:04:34] all kind of things but I have never been
[1:04:37] down about the word of
[1:04:45] God that's just
[1:04:47] personal it's impossible to believe God
[1:04:50] without having
[1:04:52] faith cuz if not you're going to try to
[1:04:54] satisfy him with your lives and that's
[1:04:56] what Cain was trying to do Cain was
[1:04:58] trying to appease
[1:05:02] him instead of believing in the
[1:05:04] atonement he was trying to appease the
[1:05:07] God but Enoch looked there and he
[1:05:13] saw
[1:05:16] God as
[1:05:19] real and so real until he could walk
[1:05:22] with him
[1:05:26] you have
[1:05:27] never
[1:05:29] experienced a time that you could walk
[1:05:32] and know that somebody was with
[1:05:39] you you got a great experience coming
[1:05:41] sometimes when it'll happen that you
[1:05:43] know that there's somebody with
[1:05:49] you and to know that he's
[1:05:52] real that he's not just the thoughts of
[1:05:54] your imagination
[1:05:56] that you can hear things and
[1:06:00] no but is he real to
[1:06:03] you or is it just what somebody else
[1:06:07] said is it what William brandham taught
[1:06:09] is it what the Lord Jesus taught is it
[1:06:11] what Paul
[1:06:15] taught or is it what's been revealed to
[1:06:17] you in your heart
[1:06:19] amen that you know is
[1:06:22] real see then you don't have to worry
[1:06:24] about it because like I started off then
[1:06:27] I can take what I believe back down to
[1:06:30] the Pentecostals of the baptism of the
[1:06:32] Holy Ghost the gifts and the back into
[1:06:34] the Baptist to the Methodist to to the
[1:06:37] Presbyterian to the Lutheran and pick up
[1:06:40] the true things they had and walk right
[1:06:44] on back to the book of
[1:06:46] Acts and stand with the Apostle
[1:06:50] Paul on the word of
[1:06:53] God can you do that
[1:06:58] well I I I didn't know it had to be that
[1:07:00] way I just thought it was just us
[1:07:01] becoming good well when are you going to
[1:07:03] become
[1:07:06] good come on you're going at it in the
[1:07:09] wrong
[1:07:10] direction you're actually going at it
[1:07:12] towards death that's what's keeping us
[1:07:21] here you know we need things a lot of
[1:07:24] times but we don't get what we need
[1:07:26] let's go one let me read one thing let's
[1:07:28] go to number nine brother Joe I want to
[1:07:32] just read this
[1:07:34] one the things that we think we need and
[1:07:37] what God gives
[1:07:39] us it's taken from there is only one way
[1:07:44] provided by God for
[1:07:48] anything listen what he
[1:07:52] says Enoch needed a ladder when day he
[1:07:56] had walked 500 years with
[1:08:00] God now had he walked 500 years or
[1:08:03] 365 he walked 365 in Earth and was
[1:08:07] before the foundation of the
[1:08:10] world if it anything Eternal it'll ever
[1:08:12] be about him don't brother R's not
[1:08:15] wrong it's just statements as a human
[1:08:18] being Mortals making it but
[1:08:21] look and it pleased God he needed a
[1:08:25] ladder
[1:08:26] God provided him a
[1:08:28] highway walked right up home Elijah
[1:08:31] needed a robe one day you remember he
[1:08:33] gave it away one time and God give him a
[1:08:35] chariot with horses to it Samson needed
[1:08:38] a spear and God gave him the Jawbone of
[1:08:41] a m mule and he beat a thousand
[1:08:44] Philistines God provides your needs God
[1:08:47] has a
[1:08:49] way that's all you need is to take What
[1:08:52] God Says and go to beaten with it just
[1:08:54] as hard as as you can and get yourself
[1:08:57] free after a while yes sir Joshua needed
[1:09:00] a bridge God provided a power a
[1:09:04] Floodgate spiritual
[1:09:06] Floodgate that held back Jordan remember
[1:09:09] stop the waters Daniel needed a fence to
[1:09:12] keep the lons off of him God gave him an
[1:09:15] angel and that's what God's provided way
[1:09:18] you know
[1:09:21] why because they please God
[1:09:27] each one of those that you read about
[1:09:29] they pleased
[1:09:33] God they walked with
[1:09:35] God they pleased
[1:09:38] him God just needed something in the
[1:09:42] Bible as an
[1:09:44] example to were you and I could have an
[1:09:47] example so he uses Noah as an example to
[1:09:51] ride up and go over and come back down
[1:09:52] to be the foolish virgins and things you
[1:09:54] know
[1:09:56] he used Enoch to be a top of the
[1:10:00] Rapture
[1:10:02] right well then we don't have
[1:10:05] to try to figure out how to do it we
[1:10:07] just
[1:10:10] walk and then whatever is
[1:10:13] needed he'll provide
[1:10:17] it just take one step at a time and
[1:10:20] don't worry about
[1:10:23] it you take a lad and stand up against
[1:10:25] the wall brother Mo used to say it years
[1:10:27] ago he said you don't run and jump up a
[1:10:29] ladder said you going to break your neck
[1:10:31] he said thing do just start on the first
[1:10:33] wrong and walk up one at a
[1:10:38] time I thought we believ that the
[1:10:41] stature of a perfect man add to your
[1:10:44] face virt are in
[1:10:46] Peter would be because of the opening of
[1:10:49] the word of
[1:10:50] God the revealing of God's word to you
[1:10:53] and I
[1:10:55] I thought that's what we
[1:10:58] believed then that way what does it take
[1:11:00] to please God believe his
[1:11:03] word as I was illustrating a while ago
[1:11:06] about the neighbors and the things where
[1:11:08] you didn't have to fence stuff you
[1:11:09] didn't have to do you had a man's
[1:11:14] word I remember a man out in Arkansas he
[1:11:18] needed about $3,000 on a church and a
[1:11:21] menite neighbor up above there said what
[1:11:23] do you need he said told him he said he
[1:11:25] just ched it out he said okay we'll sign
[1:11:26] papers he said you're shaking my
[1:11:29] hand that's
[1:11:34] enough I was raised to
[1:11:38] believe I was raised to be straight and
[1:11:40] told to be straight guy in my day told
[1:11:43] you he was going to whip you he didn't
[1:11:45] tell you he was going to whip
[1:11:47] you he just went at
[1:11:50] it you got told later you got whooped
[1:11:55] if you woke
[1:11:58] up see we was raised to be honest and
[1:12:01] true to believe what a man said the
[1:12:03] greatest honor that there is in the
[1:12:05] world and I want you to consider this as
[1:12:07] I'm closing the greatest honor even in
[1:12:09] the world is for somebody to believe
[1:12:13] what you
[1:12:15] say and you consider that for somebody
[1:12:18] to really believe that he said it and he
[1:12:22] meant it and that's it
[1:12:26] told you about a brother up here in
[1:12:27] North
[1:12:28] Carolina real good Minister brother he
[1:12:30] heard two men men talking and one of
[1:12:32] them said brother Dale said so and so he
[1:12:34] told me he said he didn't say that said
[1:12:36] I know
[1:12:37] him that was the greatest honor the man
[1:12:39] could have given me in the world a brand
[1:12:41] new Cadillac wouldn't have been
[1:12:43] significant to even think about for him
[1:12:46] to say I know the man and he didn't say
[1:12:50] it believe in God's word you know that
[1:12:54] those two serve God you really have to
[1:12:57] believe impossible
[1:13:00] things you cannot explain
[1:13:05] God you can't explain something that's
[1:13:07] revealed to you and why you are like you
[1:13:13] are you can't explain that Martin Luther
[1:13:17] don't you
[1:13:19] realize that the world's going to be
[1:13:21] against you for what you believe he said
[1:13:24] I want the the world to know I'm against
[1:13:30] them when are we going to start
[1:13:32] believing what God
[1:13:37] says when he says there's one Lord one
[1:13:40] Lord what it say one one Lord One Faith
[1:13:42] one
[1:13:44] baptism why are we going to worry about
[1:13:46] Father Son and Holy Ghost compared to
[1:13:47] Lord Jesus
[1:13:50] Christ word of God's right or wrong
[1:13:52] that's what you're going to be worried
[1:13:53] about
[1:13:58] what are you going to say about it one
[1:13:59] true and living
[1:14:01] God when in today they believe in this
[1:14:03] message that Jesus wasn't a god until
[1:14:06] the River Jordan he became God and then
[1:14:07] all one God left him left him as a man
[1:14:10] to die
[1:14:11] and that's worse than the Baptist
[1:14:13] Doctrine I've been against that you know
[1:14:20] it to believe a man's word is a great
[1:14:24] thing
[1:14:28] my wife a lot of times she doesn't know
[1:14:29] she does it but a lot of times she hurts
[1:14:31] me real bad because of one thing she'll
[1:14:33] say honey do you really mean
[1:14:35] that if I didn't say it if I didn't mean
[1:14:39] it I don't say
[1:14:44] it come on you've been with me long
[1:14:46] enough you ought to know that I walk in
[1:14:49] that real because I don't say something
[1:14:52] that I don't mean
[1:14:58] if I come and told you there's a pink
[1:15:00] elephant standing out in the yard you
[1:15:01] better believe there's a pink elephant
[1:15:03] out there but I'm not going to tell you
[1:15:05] till I see the Pink Elephant so then
[1:15:07] don't worry about it ain't no Pink
[1:15:08] Elephant out
[1:15:09] there you get what I mean God wants us
[1:15:13] to believe his word and then just walk
[1:15:15] day by day one day at a time and walk in
[1:15:18] the things that he's revealed to us and
[1:15:20] walk right up that pyramid right there
[1:15:24] and walk right on out
[1:15:26] into a change of these bodies Enoch's
[1:15:29] already proved it can be
[1:15:32] done and he done it without the new
[1:15:37] birth why would we stumble at the fact
[1:15:40] of a new birth and think that God is not
[1:15:43] with us to lead
[1:15:48] us remember he that cometh to God must
[1:15:51] believe that he
[1:15:52] is not was or going to
[1:15:57] be and he's a rewarder of them that
[1:15:59] diligently seek
[1:16:01] Him Do you see Enoch walk into your own
[1:16:04] life come on musician can you see it in
[1:16:07] your own
[1:16:09] life and say well you know what I've
[1:16:11] followed some of these things that way
[1:16:13] because that's the way I've done well
[1:16:15] you know what that's going to be
[1:16:19] true I'm just trying to get you to see
[1:16:21] the god that's in you
[1:16:27] right we believe God sent the prophets
[1:16:29] and the things all the way through
[1:16:31] time but we know one thing there's only
[1:16:34] one way to know whether a man's a
[1:16:35] prophet or not that's why we don't worry
[1:16:37] about brother brandham there's only one
[1:16:39] way of knowing where a man's a prophet
[1:16:40] or
[1:16:43] not if he stays with
[1:16:46] this the
[1:16:48] word but if he gets out of this then we
[1:16:51] get away from it because remember in the
[1:16:53] Bible say says if a Prophet come and he
[1:16:56] gives you a sign and the sign comes to
[1:17:02] pass but said he takes you to another
[1:17:05] God you don't believe that
[1:17:08] man but you see we wouldn't raised to do
[1:17:10] and what we should have been you know
[1:17:12] that in the Bible that if Wade in the
[1:17:15] Bible times if Wade got up and
[1:17:16] prophesied something wrong I'm just
[1:17:18] supposed to kill him that's just all it
[1:17:19] is
[1:17:22] to that's what I supposed to do and
[1:17:25] that's what a lot of them done just take
[1:17:27] out and kill
[1:17:28] him why because he's a
[1:17:31] liar but see we don't live in them
[1:17:34] days so we don't go out and kill them we
[1:17:38] just maybe beat them over the head you
[1:17:40] know a little but don't kill
[1:17:43] them but see Could You Walk Off the
[1:17:46] Earth right now on what you believe
[1:17:58] that's the
[1:18:00] question I hope you know what it means
[1:18:02] not to walk with God is to walk in his
[1:18:05] word as he reveals it to you so then
[1:18:08] let's just take it one day at the
[1:18:12] time Brother D ain't you worried about
[1:18:14] the days and the times
[1:18:17] no CU I know he's right on
[1:18:23] time somebody's going to walk off this
[1:18:25] Earth one day in a
[1:18:30] Rapture they're going to be caught up
[1:18:33] because the word rapture is not even in
[1:18:34] the scriptures it's caught
[1:18:36] up see Enoch was caught
[1:18:39] up in what he
[1:18:43] believed the God that he saw became
[1:18:50] real and he just took a stroll
[1:18:58] and we walk with god what about it let's
[1:19:04] stand 87 in the red book anybody have a
[1:19:16] need anybody have a
[1:19:20] need giving cheer everywhere to the
[1:19:45] S he go all the while what about
[1:19:50] it do you see God is real
[1:19:56] or is he just a thought or imagination
[1:20:30] we just ask you to go our sister has a
[1:20:32] friend who has a need we send his prayer
[1:20:35] call in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:20:38] amen anybody

[1:21:35] believe if not you better start crawling
[1:21:39] Anyway come on folks it's time
[1:21:57] Lord Jesus you know what our brother has
[1:21:59] need
[1:22:00] of he's asking you to help him so we
[1:22:03] believe the help is on the way we commit
[1:22:06] it all to you we know the story so we
[1:22:09] just ask you to come on the scene now
[1:22:12] you work it all out in Jesus

[1:22:24] keep up with a footman what about when
[1:22:26] the horsemen get

[1:22:32] meaning if you can't keep up with
[1:22:34] something slow how you going to do when
[1:22:35] it gets real
[1:22:37] fights if you can't walk day by
[1:22:40] day loving God and serving
[1:22:43] him with all your
[1:22:46] heart then don't worry about a
[1:22:49] change it's not coming for you you're
[1:22:53] going by the grave
[1:22:56] why because you can't stand there that

[1:23:01] be well why can't we believe we're part
[1:23:04] of
[1:23:09] it come on why can't we believe we're
[1:23:11] part of
[1:23:13] it why can't we say that's me that it's

[1:23:28] did that add to the word no that made it
[1:23:31] personal to
