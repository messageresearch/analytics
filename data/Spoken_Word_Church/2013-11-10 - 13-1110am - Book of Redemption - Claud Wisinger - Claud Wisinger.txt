========================================

amen let's all stand at this time my last brother carly if you come with a responsive reading hey man good morning everyone good morning thank you lord to be here again we're going to read from hebrews 12th chapter verses 1 through 15. thank you so we went home the other day so i killed deer for the first time in two or three decades by the way uh just thank the lord for it you know i said well no matter what size turtle brother demon season started i said if i see the first one i see there's two ounces bigger than bambi i'm shooting but anyway i just thank the lord for for the blessing i mean um then one thing i'll say i want to kind of testify about two or three weeks ago we had been hunting and we're leaving the woods and as i got almost back to the expressway this guy an 18 wheeler just turned right across in front of me and all i could do was just stop that time i said well you know after i stopped and took off it really didn't upset me scared after death but didn't upset me i said well you know i thank the lord that he was safe and i will say and so i forgot about it pretty quickly you know if you go into a rage it takes a long time to shake that rage off but if you thank the lord for what happened you know the safe part of it you're so much better off for it that's right amen that's right and what else i want to ask y'all i'm gonna keep it too long uh i just read the message spiritual food in due season it's a great message it's a short message you ought to read it when you get time amen let's pray heavenly father we are grateful and we're thankful for this day but we thank for all the blessings god that you have restored upon us lord for their many failures lord and errors that we make in life love you will forgive us from all lords we will come to you lord and ask you for your blessings lord we ask you each one that is present this morning god that you would touch their hearts and soul lord grant unto him lord that which they have need of lord you said if we would believe that you were granted unto us god and we ask you to be your way bless the services bless this reading and bless the oncoming services in jesus christ and we pray amen to read hebrews 12 hebrews 12 1 through 15. okay wherefore seeing we all saw our compassion about was so great a cloud of witness let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before at the right us of the throne of god for considering him that endureth much contradiction of sinners against himself lest ye be weary and faint in your minds and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chesting of the lord not faint when thou art rebuked of him if you endure chasing god deals with you as with son for what son is he whom the father chastens not furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall not we much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and life now no chastening for the presence seems to be joyous but grievous nevertheless afterwards it yieldeth the peaceful fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby and make straight paths for your feet lest that which is lame be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed looking deadly lest any man feel of the grace of god lest any root or business spring of trouble for you and thereby men and be defiled amen god bless you be seated thank you let's turn over to number 252 in the spiral book that's 252 single

of my heart open the eyes open the eyes he'll make a way shining in the light of your me good morning good to see each and every one of you again been a while it's been kind of a rough year for me physically i've had a couple of bouts in the hospital and just the devil's mad at us that's all i can say you know brother ham said every gun every devil in hell their guns are aimed at this bride and so uh me and brother wade i thought it was kind of comical we went by this baptist church up here on the way here and uh i told brother wade i said man they got it made you know they really do because every devil in hell is aimed at us right i'm trying to no matter what you try to do the devil's there to try to to cut your wheels off your wagon like brother branham said so i look at them and sometimes i say boy they got it easy but you know it's it's just our reasonable services all it is when you look and see what he's done for us it's just this is just small what we do as part of this but uh like i said last time i've been kind on a series but i've kind of been a series but a sub series and i started out with cod i really believe that you know brother roy borders put the c.o.d book together and the first thing that we understand is called cod conduct order and doctrine and i believe if you're going to be the bride of jesus christ i think you're going to have all those things i believe your conduct is going to be correct i believe your order you know the opposite of order is chaos and so i believe we're going to be orderly as the bride and i believe we're going to have the right doctrine i really believe that i believe our doctrine is going to line up with the bible and i think if you've got all those things lined up i think your bride right but if i think you get any one of those out of order i don't think you're right i really don't you may call yourself bride but i don't believe your bride unless you get everything put together and so i went through the church and i discussed the conduct sometimes you you know i've heard preachers say well we don't need the clothesline preaching around here i've looked around our congregation and yes they do it's part of it you know in the old testament uh under moses is a part of you know the book of redemption exodus joshua that high priest had to be addressed a certain way to go into the holy of holies you know we're kings and priests and we've got to be dressed a certain way to go in there and so you got to be careful how you approach god you really do god's got an order to it conduct to it and we have a doctrine in this hour and if those things please god i believe you're bright i really do but i uh since i've been here last time i kind of uh went and i preached on the book of life i preached i don't know how many parts on that and really broke it down for the people and i'm kind of like brother uh brother samuel i it's hard for me to get everything in one service i'm kind of like brother branham he said he was numb he was numb-minded you know your prophet said that brother brown was numb-minded he wasn't educated he had a seventh grade education of course i got more in that education but i'm still numb-minded i will tell you that and so it takes us a while to get these things out and i tell the church it's kind of like my wife's here is real long and i always like to watch her braid it and all that you know comb it out in the morning and she doesn't just comb it out once she'll comb the outside of it she combs the inside of it and she comes back through all of it and so i said that's kind of what i am as a pastor i kind of comb through this thing this message and i'm going to get all the tangles out what i don't understand until this thing gets real nice and that's kind of what the ministry is doing now we're going back through kind of going through it and trying to get everything you know lined up with the word is really what it is but preached on the book of life and i i feel like this is just me i don't think you can really understand the book of redemption without understanding the book of life you know brother brahman one statement under the when brother branham was preaching on the seals he said now we understand the truth on serpent seed he preached serpenty in 1959 but you know what i really think started clearing up the book of life to him that's really what i think and by that then then serpency could be cleared up when you understand book of life if you don't understand the book of life you'll never get uh serpent seed and the different segments of uh you know there's the church there's the bride there's 144 thousand right so you know we need to understand all these things and we live in an hour where we do understand these things it's a wonderful hour it really is so uh anyway so after that i got to thinking i thought well what really is the book of redemption you know we say it and we know brother brown said it so i said i'm going to go back i want to look i want to explain to the people exactly what the book of redemption is and so that's what i did so um i want to read some scriptures here i don't know if he's got it on there yet but i want to go to hebrews 11 and 1. sorry to leave you standing i don't mean to do that i'm not like jewel brother jewel forney he's the helicopter preacher he goes straight up makes his trip and comes down i go real slow to get there then i'll hit it then i'll come down okay so that's just kind of the way i am but i want to read hebrews 11 and 1 here in 1 and 2. it says now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders take obtained a good report right i almost get down to hebrews 11 6 but without sin is impossible to please him it's absolutely impossible to please god without faith for he that cometh to god must believe that he is is the i am today he is his present tense is that right you have to believe he is okay and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him is that right let's bow our heads if you would dear heavenly father we thank you for the reading of the word we pray that you'll give the church here this morning here to hear what the spirit saith oh father and lord just be with me let me get myself out of the way may you minister this great subject to the book of redemption oh father and we ask these things in jesus christ's name amen you may be seated i want to go back what i did was at our church i thought well i went through literally and i looked at every quote where brother ram talked about the book of redemption and then i thought okay what books in the bible did brother branham refer to as the book of redemption and if you go out on the internet and you do a retrieval all the people all the preachers before our prophet william branham when they talked about the book of redemption they'll point to exodus they'll say exodus the book of redemption okay always that's what they point to but brother branham through the message i looked at i said okay what books did he refer to as the book of redemption okay the first one of course is exodus in excellence you look anywhere it says the book of redemption everybody understands that redemption has two parts redemption is out of and into so if you've came out of the world and the things the world but you haven't got all the way through your trip then you're just not finished yet okay and quite honestly our trip in this hour is a new body so this thing is not finished until you get a glorified body i'm going to be honest with you you think well i got the baptism of the holy ghost that's it well you're sealed in but you need to get a new body and one thing i've understood about the baptism in the holy ghost there's a lot of people say well you got the baptism holy ghost you're just you won't make any more mistakes that's not what your prophet said he said you'll be sticky all the way through as long as you've got this body you're subject to mistakes brother branham said in the message he said moses was a failure sure do you know brother ham said that i'm gonna really shock you brother branham was a failure he was a man we all failed i'm a failure your pastor's a failure your assistant pastor you are a failure at best your best day you're a failure because remember what he said to abraham abraham it's not what you've done it's what i've done for you and that's the revelation we need to have in this hour it's not what you do it's what god's done for you now that's the real truth of it okay so in the in exodus it's a it's a book of redemption and brother adam also referred to joshua as a book of redemption did you know that and and of course joshua means jehovah savior and in joshua what they were doing was positionally placing the jews exactly where they would go in the promised land is that right so a part of your redemption is to positionally place you where you need to be right so you get into the promised land but there's a positioning once you get there we know that's adoption we all understand that right then brother branham talked about ruth he said ruth was an absolute perfect type of redemption is what brother branham said of course we understand brother branham preached the four parts in ruth first part was deciding does anybody know that deciding or a decision is justification your justification is you have decided to take a certain route does everybody understand that do you know they're out there there's churches 969 churches in 1960 there's ways right do you know the highway that you picked for me to come here was it a decision i made does everybody understand that you understand the the servant in the bible talks about servant you remember first pool second full third pool it said go into the highways and the hedges do you know what he went into brother brandon went into the denominations and sucked the life out of them that's what the high that what is a highway it's a decision you make to get from point a to point b to get to atlanta there's more than one highway is there not and that's the way it is we look at the christian world they say well there's more than one way right but we understand it's a highway to heaven is that right one lord one faith one baptism jesus said i am the way the truth and the life so the way that you take is a decision that you make you have to you made a decision this morning to come to this church god will never take that away from you your free moral agency so justification is deciding and then serving is sanctification is that right that you're going to serve him and the third part is resting is that right remember ruth she just was sitting in the house resting while while boaz did the work of the kinsmen redeemer she was resting is that right he was it was he was the one doing it all she just had to rest at that point and then after that she was rewarded is that right so ruth is a wonderful type of redemption perfect time then we've got ephesians does everybody understand ephesians parallels joshua so the book of ephesians if you want to understand redemption read that book okay now i'm going to stop here and say something your pastor's been in that book how many parts have you been preaching predestination can you preach predestination and not preach how to you've got to have ephesians to do it right so ephesians the predestination the perfect church in ephesians right we understand brother brahm said the corinthian church was a messed up church god had to constantly correct that church i preached a message at our church one time i said gathered here you know there's three types of believers here today unbeliever make believer believer and you know i said i'm going to divide the church right down the middle i'm going to pretend corinthians over here ephesians over here the corinthians ones you've got to correct all the time the ephesians ones are that perfect predestinated bunch that you don't have to constantly tell them the do's and don'ts but you can get into the mysteries you can bring them to perfection you see what i'm saying so ephesians is really what it is it's bringing you to perfection is what it is so it's a type of redemption and the other book is revelations does everybody understand the entire book of revelations is nothing more than redemption and i'll explain that all the way from chapter brother branham really isolates chapter five when he talks about redemption right he says the book that was opened there was a book of redemption now i'm going to tell you where can you prove that in the bible you can't can you there's nowhere you can prove it now i'm going to make a real startling statement to you the term the book of redemption is not even in the bible you go out to the bible and you look at retrieving book of redemption you won't find one head right if you go out the message you'll find 63. yeah does everybody agree so when we talk about the book of redemption i wanted to understand what is the book of redemption right right so i said i've got to go to the bible face final resting place is in the word come on isn't it so i got to find it in there but you won't find the phrase book of redemption anywhere in the bible in the message you'll find it but you will not find it there so i got to thinking what and i'm kind of getting ahead of myself here but i want to let you know so you can kind of see where i'm going to go there so what is the book of redemption it's a mysterious book it's a mystery that's what the book of redemption is it's a and i can read a quote where brother ram said it and i in a minute i'll read it just to back up i'm not just saying it myself but brother ma'am said the book of redemption is a mysterious book is that right the term book of redemption is not even mentioned in the bible the term book of redemption is a theologian that read exodus and said well this is redemption and they're right they have they're right exodus is a book of redemption and all those five books that i listed brother random referred to them throughout the message as book of redemption so when i when this is what i want to get today what i'm going to talk about this morning and tonight i want to talk about the book of redemption that's really what i want to talk about because i told my church i said you know i want to understand it i really want to understand the book of redemption so i know it's a mysterious book so for us to understand the book of redemption we're going to have to get into the mysteries of the message is that is that fair is that fair now do you need to have a revelation of the book of redemption yes you do the mysteries are the important part that's been passed down through this day so i'm going to talk about that you know and so when i refer to book of redemption right away your brain ought to say these are the mysteries he's going to talk about right that's what you've been preaching on for how many parts you've been on predestination it's a mystery to them out there i mean they got parts of it you go to a baptist church they'll preach predestination won't they right they will but man it's once saved always say once you're a baptist you dress like the world you do anything you want to do we don't believe it that way we believe priya's destination by four knowledge is that right we believe that if you're predestinated to it then you'll confirm conform to the word is that right and that's the way we believe here we believe in predestination we just don't believe it like they do we believe it's free moral agency i don't think god will take your free moral agency away even when you have the baptism holy ghost i told the church after i get preaching today if i want to go smoke a cigarette i could do it but i don't have the want to does everybody understand so god's never going to take away your free moral agency but some people think oh boy man when you get the holy ghost you'll never make a mistake wow they live in a different world than i live in i mean you know i'd like to get like to that point but as long as i got this boy with me this cannot be perfected does everybody understand that you can try your hardest and this boy is going to let you down every day so that's why i was saying before what i've understood looking at the book of redemption i am a failure at best that's right amen i believe that i really do so i want to read a scripture now and i want to go to you know what i did was i went through the book of redemption and and preached in it i went to uh revelations and preached revelation chapter five and then when in preaching starting through redemption it actually uncovers the whole book of revelation that's right did you know that we refer to well you know brother brahm said and you go look at i'd like to kind of sum up revelation revelation chapter 1 is telling you about jesus christ about the deity of jesus christ is that right so that's an important step in redemption then the second the third chapter tells you about the church ages right chapter four says come up hither brother said it's the rapture how many do you see on the throne in chapter three four one there's one that's set up on the throne you've been caught up hither you've been caught up higher than the church ages the churches out there believing the trinitarian doctrine i don't believe that i've come up hither i see one throne is what i see is that right there's a doorman open to me and that door is jesus christ i know who my redeemer is see redemption is you've got to know who the redeemer is but you got to know who you are too does everybody agree with that so chapter four you come up you're in a rapture okay the rapture is caught up what how are we caught up in a revelation we have a much higher revelation than what they had through the church ages that's chapter four chapter five brother baby said chapter five was a book of redemption is that what he said amen and you know i i looked at it and you know and i hear preachers they say well the reason that john the revelator stopped crying because he's seen who jesus was right that he was the lamb of god the flesh of god i tell our church when you see lamb of god you put this in their fleshy god because lamb is talking about flesh so jesus christ was the flesh of god does everybody understand that so we in chapter 5 we understand that jesus christ is the flesh of god they say well that's why he quit crying true but that's only half the picture there's two things that made him quit crying not only did he see the flesh of god the redeemer he also seen he was the redeemed so not only did he see who jesus was he seen who he was he sent his name on the book right the book of life now that's what he sees so the reason john the revelator quit crying it was two parts to it not just one exactly right you gotta identify it's not enough jesus's identifying the word you have to be identified the word too so a part of redemption you're a part of it he's the redeemer you're the redeemed so john the revelator seen that in chapter five does everybody agree that's what he's seen and i'm going to stop there because that's as far as i'm going to book a redemption today anyway so i want to read a scripture to you so now i'm in the book of exodus i've been on there for 20 parts i think you're 20 parts on predestination and that's wonderful there's nothing wrong with that and you know i told the church when you're past there's one quality about a pastor i've learned a pastor doesn't mind repeating himself has anybody ever watched evangelists they hate to come to your church and preach the same message over again i've had one particular preacher and just i laugh at it because i'm a pastor see i don't he he preaches a message he'll come to me when he preaches you know because he's an older gentleman and say if i ever preach that at your church if i say yeah he won't preach it again i thought you're definitely not a pastor i can tell that because you don't have the quality of a pastor when you're a pastor you'll preach that thing a hundred times until they get it and i told the church i'll tell you how i am as a pastor i'm like a pit bull with a bone try to get it from me the only way i'm going to give up that bone is when i know you got it i can look at your faces there's some god gives in a pastor a gift to know when you got it and it's time to move on do you agree and you'll stay with predestination you're on 20 if it takes 120 you're going to stay right there until they get it and i'm going to tell you something predestination is a part of the book of redemption it's a part of your redemption and i i might read it here in a minute but as i was going through and i've been going through the book of exodus i said the book of exodus to me shows the characteristics of redemption that's why they say it's the book of redemption either coming out going into but it shows you a lot of the the the the characteristics of how you're going to get all the way does everybody understand that and so i want to stop now and i want to read exodus 6 for a minute and it's kind of what i said earlier i'm going to take a drink my allergies have been killing me since i got off the plane i don't know what's growing here but wow i got to brother wade's what was it friday afternoon i was so sick i didn't think i'd be able to preach today he had he's going to have teeth work done so he put him on some amoxicillin well he had enough for me too so hey it all worked out so i mean me and him been sharing a matter of fact i got the bottle now so we've been sharing his bottle let me tell you that so we're real brothers we can take the same pills we can chew the same gum dude you know that right brother way so i appreciate it but god knew what i need he had it right here for me so i'm going to just keep moving on today so i want to turn if you would with you got your bibles let's turn to exodus 6 6. and this is a part of redemption and the reason the reason i read hebrews 11 is look there is no such prevailing power as a revelation from god the most important thing that this church each and every one of you here will have is a revelation all right there's that does your meal that you eat your job that you have your wife your daddy your husband what there's nothing more important than a revelation from god it's impossible to even please god without it and god has put that in in the bible for a real reason and god put it on display in exodus 6. now let me read it let me read what it says i i when i've read this it's been one of my favorite scriptures now when i go to the next subject i do that'll be my favorite scripture i don't know if you're that way that's kind of the way i am so exodus 6 6 wherefore say to the children of israel i am the lord first thing you're going to know what happened in revelation chapter 4 when you come up here you're going to know i am the lord right right what did israel have to know i am the lord thy god right they didn't bring those heathen gods with them on the journey when they come out as part of the redemption they knew who god was okay can i say it that way and listen this is what i'll listen to after this what it says and i will bring you out from the burdens of the egyptians god's going to do it and i will rid you out of their bondage and i will redeem you with a stretched out arm who's that stretch forward out on moses right what was the vessel he used moses and with great judgments and i will take you to me for a people and i will be to you a god and this is the only thing that you're going to have something to do with and you shall know that i am the lord glory amen remember the last time i was here i preached i know and i said anytime you see the word i know in the bible it means faith it means a revelation is that right the woman and i don't know if you know this the woman who touched the heart the garment of jesus robin was healed the the priests and the scribes in that hour were preaching doctrine in the in the synagogues that this is what they said it's something they said okay they said when a messiah comes you can you know he'll walk through the city you can touch the hill and his garment and you'll be healed so what when that sister who had that issue for what 12 years or however long a long time when she's seen him walking through she said in her mind she had a revelation that was the messiah does everybody understand that she said i know if i can touch the hem of this garment i'll be saved why because the scribes and pharisees said when a messiah comes you touch the hem of his garment you'll be saved what she put on display was her revelation amen god honored her revelation jesus was walking along and stopped all of a sudden said who touched me peter said are you kidding me the people are pressing you and you want to know who touched you he said i feel virtue has left me what was it god had to honor that little woman's faith because that woman openly was testifying now you heard what the scribes and pharisees said i believe this man's the messiah i've got an issue of blood that nothing will take care of it but i know if i touches him i'll be healed did she get it god honored her revelation does everybody understand that so there's one thing in coming out of egypt there's only one thing you got to do you got to know you got to have a revelation that's why it's part of redemption there's nothing more important than a revelation of god that's the most important thing you can have in this hour is a revelation right now everybody understand a revelation is something that's been made known to you it's something that god has personally revealed to you and he says ye shall know right he made it personal to israel you're gonna know i did all that you had nothing to do with it israel but one thing you better under you better have a revelation it's me doing it right it's not you doing it i'm doing it for you that's right that's right it's not what abraham did it's what god did for him so a big part of redemption is you need to understand he's the one doing it right sure he is and i went and i read a couple and i got a couple quotes here if you want to put it on the right where it says exodus there's a couple of quotes i read what i do is i don't know brother i'm sure brother's saying the same this guy i call him say where can you find this quote i've heard preachers say it and they paraphrase it you know i paraphrase scripture you know i paraphrase quotes there's nothing wrong with that but i've heard people paraphrase i say where is it and he'll say well i think it's and sure enough it'll be there man i wish i had this guy's brain i like to say i am numb minded so i call him someone and say you know yeah i do and he'll tell me and sure enough it's there amazes me but let's look at this first quote he says now we've been speaking in the book of exodus and this was in 1955 which is the book of the calling out the book of redemption of the old testament i love it because it's a beautiful book and i believe that it's very profitable for us to study it now amen now does everybody understand that that's what he said because i believe the church is in another exodus everybody's read or heard the tape third exodus right everybody understands we're in a third exodus okay the church is in another exodus calling out the exodus means called out called out means the church and now god is calling his people out of every walk of life to come and receive him and to believe on him and he's showing great signs and wonders in these last days and he's calling people ministers from all walks of life call them into the ministry right next quote pop it up here on this one on the exodus this is in 1954 and i really i really love this listen i'm going to show you how important brother man thought the book of exodus was listen to what he said when i read this it kind of i thought why why is he telling us this is so important there's got to be a reason behind him saying so he says we're taking israel now in their journey coming do you know brother branham preached a year on exodus you've read the quote where brother adam said we too he took a year on exodus so exodus is a very important book in the bible now it's all important i'm going to eat the whole book is that right i'm not some of these guys are going to tear certain books out because they say it don't apply to us look the whole book's the book of redemption what do you mean it don't apply to me you're a jew inwardly right i'm gonna i'm gonna say something ahead of time daniel's 70 weeks is redemption to israel glory you agree with that we i know he does so you're going to tear redemption out of the book you need all the book if god ever set up a a way to redeem israel he's going to redeem us the same way exactly six-fold purpose of daniel was to redeem israel right do you agree six seals we redeemed us the seventh seal was the coming of the lord right amen that's what it so god's way he redeemed israel is exactly the same way he redeemed us is exactly the same way he'll redeem the earth so if god ever sets a plan or redemption up he can't set it up for the jews one way and us another if he did then god found a better way to do it see god's not like us he don't build a house and step back and say man i wish i wouldn't put them steps there no is that what we do see we're a failure at best you see what i'm getting but god don't do it that way once god puts something in the scripture it's going to be that way and what you need to do is understand what it is because what people what they do now is they take away the how many knows the the church organizations if you start talking about a woman you know 22 5 says does it not in deuteronomy says a woman is not supposed to wear that to pertain it to a man when i was a kid i don't know about you when i was in a schoolyard we would tease other kids and say who wears the pants in your family right a pants was a very masculine thing not feminine i remember getting kicked in the shin by a little girl one time wearing this black and white oxfords did you wear them sister you might have your grin those leather stuck out that far that girl kicked me i thought i got kicked by a mule and what i told her was your mama wears the pants in your family boy that got her attention you know we used to know how we were wired in them days here down today i'm not sure how some people were wired out there does deuteronomy 25 still work today it does for me all right it really does we're talking israel now in their journey coming out of egypt type of the world on their way to palestine the promised land i think it's a beautiful thing i just love it listen to what your prophet said pretty near every week right i sat down and read through the book of exodus if i can or as much of it as i can i love it because it's a perfect type of the church today does everybody understand that that was a shadow of things to come the condition and how god is moving amen right move then what he did it in the natural then he's doing in a spiritual now see you're a jew inwardly is that what paul said so for us it's a spiritual thing for the jews it was a natural land a physical land but what our land is is the is the new body we're coming to it don't end with the holy ghost people does everybody it's not it doesn't end you've got to get a glorified body like his body that's how you're going to make a rapture right flesh and blood will not inherit the kingdom of god you're going to have a body like that's why you're going to meet him in the air he's going to be there with a glorified body and you're going to meet him there you're not going to meet him with this ugly thing you see preaching today i'm going to be about a 20 year old man won't be prettier i'll be what i am here i like i told brother wade i wasn't in the pretty line i must have missed that line i was in the ugly line but you know god has big mountains little mountains did you know that right now whatever you are here whatever you were at 20 is what you're going to be there like it or not a perfect type of the church today the condition in how god is moving so don't be you know if you're fat who cares i'm not worried about it right but sure you'll be perfectly fat how's that i don't know how to say it god's a god of variety did you know that right he didn't make us all beautiful move the yeah i know move then what did he what he did in the natural then he's doing his spiritual see it now there he led it natural israel natural where they seen look move them out of a certain land into another natural land now we're moved by the holy spirit in going now into the promised land you believe we're on a road to a promised land in my father's house is many mansions if it wasn't so i would have told you i'll go and prepare a place for you is that right now we have a promised land that we're going to and each day marks a milestone has anybody ever done any project work knows what a milestone is you're grinning you've done it you know what the word means when i worked in i.t work like when we got 25 percent through a project we had a party we had cake we had punch we meet we meet we reached a milestone is that what we did if anybody's ever done a project that's what we did hey you were part of the team and boy we reached a milestone we're going to celebrate every day ought to be a milestone every day ought to be a celebration to you every day when you get home at night and you still believe the message you still are pressing on toward the mark of the eye calling like paul said it's a milestone to you before you lay down and go to bed tonight you ought to thank god you ought to have a celebration that he kept you it's not what you did it's what he did on the journey so every day is a milestone another day another milestone see we're on a journey like it or not we're on a journey a spiritual journey right so that's what we're on so i wanted to bring in two quotes to you i thought that when brother brahm said he read the book of exodus once a week i thought wow and then i started thinking about it i said why you know you do that don't you preachers are weird they're always why when they read something in the bible they go why and god starts dealing with him we start looking at close we start looking at the scripture and try to tie it all together why and i got to thinking well of course do you understand that we've had three exodus prophets and i preached the sermon exodus prophet so i'm gonna have touch on it today does everybody understand moses was an exodus prophet does everybody understand that jesus was an exodus prophet does everybody understand william branham was an exodus prophet and the way god dealt with moses is exactly the way he dealt with his son even moses said there will be a prophet likened unto me is that what he said in deuteronomy he said the lord thy god is going to send you a prophet likened unto me amen is that right so william branham was likened unto moses he was likened unto jesus does everybody understand he was no different did did god give moses two signs he did he gave him the rod that he could throw down now those rods those signs had a voice to him do you agree so that rod that god gave moses when he threw it down and then janice and jamborees could do the same trick or a trick not god doing but the trick they threw it down and his rod ate their rod you know what that rod was telling you no matter what pharaoh on his musicians you're going to throw at you your rod's going to overcome their world that was the type of the rod that mo so moses no matter what pharaoh throws down in front of you boy you're going to overcome it right do you know we're more than overcomers in this hour no matter what the devil pharaoh throws down in front of you my rod's going to eat theirs up there is nothing going to stop us there's nothing to stop jesus christ there's nothing that stopped william branham either so that's what the rod in the healing he would take his hand stick in his coat pull it out and i'm going to tell you i don't know about you but when you pull that thing out he said it was white with leprosy does anybody understand when it turns white right after that the whole thing falls off right i tell you what if i bet moses jumped back 10 yards it would have scared the fire out of me pull that thing in and stick it out and that thing was white leprosy that's the final stage is leprosy right that that thing their fingers fall off man he jumped back and he looked at him so can i stick it back in he stuck it back in it was restored right so what it's showing you is moses was a restoration prophet that was the voice that spoke by the sign these these things that god gave brother man were not frivolous they spoke to us they told us what it is the sign has a voice right sure everybody got that so each one of the prophets got two signs three pools can i say it that way are you okay and the third one was the voice of the sign exactly right he had a thunder to it it really did in jesus hour and what was he going to what did moses what was moses purpose to restore the people back to a natural promised land and to get them positionally placed in that land is that right do you know the names of those children of israel was their names meant if you look up what they're meaning that's how they were placed in the land joshua right amen right you know how you're placed in the land by your name that was put on a book before the foundation of the world when you see your name on the book that name on that book is what positionally places you down here is everybody okay with that amen so then jesus come he had two signs right jesus had healing what did it prove jesus was a restoration prophet amen any time you see a prophet with healing in their ministry it's showing you there's a restoration in the earth right brother man said the healing is a restoration of your body right right so jesus came and he they when he healed and lay hand over the seat they loved him there wasn't a church out there that wouldn't have jesus in them that's right the second pool was prophecy come on everybody agree with that so jesus had a sign where he could discern the thought and intent of the heart right everybody agree with that amen the woman at the well he discerned her thought in the title of her heart right he said yep you sure do you've got six husbands and one you're living with now ain't yours right so he deserved the thought the woman didn't speak that he discerned that i'm going to tell you something about that discernment gift the first time we ever seen it was with melchizedek i'm going to tell you something when you get you see discernment in the land like that it's doom right right it's impending doom right because when god sent that sign with melchizedek when melchizedek was standing standing there and deserve the thought intent of sarah's heart behind the tent it wasn't a day or two later sodom was destroyed with fire right so the every sign that god gave those prophets it was a voice to that sign and the voice for that sign of discernment was there was impending doom coming in melchizedek sodom gomorrah was burned in the hour of jesus 40 years after he prophesied in 70 a.d titus surrounded jerusalem and destroyed her she became desolate exactly does everybody understand that in this hour we've had another prophet william branham he's had discernment and it's impending doom for america he even said i see america burning i see craters i see america burning is that right so what is it it's it's that sign of that was a end-time sign it showed the gentile people were at the end of our road it's a serious hour we live in america right so we understand jesus the first one was his healing the second one was the discernment so and if the people would have picked up they could have went to the old testament figured out when they seen that sign with melchizedek it was a short while later sodom was destroyed right they should have picked up on what the sign was so the sign had a voice so in our hour we've had another exodus prophet in william marion branham that's why he could sit there and preach the third exodus we are right now on the journey of the third exodus or moving toward our new body a house not made with hands is that right so brother madam what was his first pull hand he would grab somebody and bumps would come up he could say well you got this or you got that by what came up on his hand but brother brandon when he prayed for him he'd grab their hand and he'd be his hand wouldn't do that right so what was it healing campaigns what was it there was a restoration prophet in the land again the voice of the sign is we have had a restoration prophet that's going to restore us back to something is that fair to say in moses day he restored him to a natural land right in jesus hour he restored the word to him right right in this hour what what have we had restored back to us what have we got back the book of redemption can i say it this way the book of life now the book of redemption is different in the book of life i'm gonna be honest with you it is and i'm gonna explain to you how it is okay but if you look well let me i'll get there i'm gonna get there this afternoon i'm not gonna get ahead of myself if i can keep from it so we understand william mary and brian do we believe he's a prophet i do i'm not ashamed to say it at all the reason i'm not ashamed to say it because it's in the scriptures moses was vindicated because in the days of abraham he said god's going to take you out of out of bondage with a strong hand right he said 400 years from now it's going to happen right you know how many anybody understand how many years it happened 440. did god lie about his word the people of israel the israelites weren't ready to come out yet it was the readiness of israel that held them up do you agree we got in this hour where most people that pick on this message will say brother and prophesy or predicted brother brahma never said prophesy brother brahman said i predict now did the lord allow him to he said the lord allowed him to say that did you know that yeah but he said i predict 1977 by the seven visions that he had and the last one was america laying in ruins is that right he said i predict by the way things are going so fast science and everything that in 1977 that all seven of the visions would come would be fulfilled right but you know what you know this is my humble opinion i'll say it that way to me we weren't ready to go out in 1970 some of you weren't even in the church then what held it up the readiness of the bride do i have a problem with brother brown say in 1977 no not a bit but i'm going to tell you something after the seals world and brother bram never said it again go ahead see if there's a quote i've looked at it and you have to there's no quote after the seals why because that mighty angel come down and said time will be no more right it's no calendar it's no time on what we got does everybody understand that i'm going to be honest with there's no more revelation after that the mystery of god was finished when that prophet exactly preached those seals all we can do is say what's said on tape exactly and try to break it down so you everybody here can get it in your gray matter and it'll drop down into your heart brother ram talk about intellectual revelation right and then a true revelation is down on the third pull the inside of the inside you know your intellect will run out oh yeah you know that's what we're seeing in the message we see people have been in the message thirty and four some of you might have been how many of you have been here how many has been in this message 30 years can you imagine dropping out there's been guys in the message 30 years and dropping out you know what they had an intellectual conception of the message but they never had a revelation because if you've got a revelation that revelation is a foundation it's established a foundation once you pour it you don't change that exactly all right it's done is that right so when you've got a revelation it is it's a foundation it's established and you can put the house on it does everybody got that right so what happens to these guys they say well i was in the message then they blasted if brother brown was a prophet they never seen it in the scriptures they it was never revealed to him or made known to him they seen the works that he did they seen the healing campaign they seen the discernment but they never got to the third pull they never got a revelation of the message because everybody understand they never got to the mystery part of it i'm going to be honest with you guys if a preacher don't preach the mysteries the book of redemption can i say it that way it's a mysterious book if the preachers do not preach the mysteries that was contained under the seals they're not preaching rapturing faith exactly amen exactly amen brother ben said this ain't my thinking right it was beyond brother branham's intellect do you understand amen brother and brethren after 63 look at how many quotes where brother am said you ain't got a thought coming right that's after 63 you started making that see your thought your intellect ain't got nothing it's just gray matter your thoughts are as good as my thoughts your opinion's as good as my opinion i don't have opinion i have thus saith the i want lord to know when i say william branham was a prophet i got scripture to back me up now if you can't see it then you better ask for a revelation more than right your necessary meat that's what we need to be praying for this church right here needs to be paying praying for a revelation absolutely that's what you need to do and that's why the book of redemption it's a mysterious book amen it's a book of mysteries right and if a preacher in this message is not preaching the mysteries they're not preaching the book of redemption i don't know how else to put it that's what i put to our church that's why i think do we need to understand the book of redemption you better you better don't you think we need to understand it amen let's start going through and i'm gonna go real quick and see what time you usually get out here in the morning what funny well there's time no more so don't worry about it i already preached that so i'm not gonna back off that okay i'm not gonna hold you too much longer i just wanted to lay this out and go to the go to exodus and we're gonna cruise through it real quick i preached 20 sermons and i've got to chapter 12 in exodus am i ever going to get done with it i can see why brother man it took a year to preach in it i told the church it took me seven messages to preach on the third pool finally the last day i was there i got through it in an hour i stood there in the pulpit and i went i've tried seven services to get this out and i finally got it out and you know not and i'm not trying to build me up don't get me wrong i'm not but a sister that's been in a message 40 years put a note on my desk before that night service that sunday morning she said brother claude i've never understood the first pool the second pool or third pool like you have ministered it she said i now got the revelation of what it was i'm not building me up it makes me feel good that somebody got the mysteries of these things is that right okay now the first look and you've been preaching on predestination right so i'm going to show you the very first thing that it says in exodus is predestination look at what it says now these are the names of the children of israel which came into egypt every man in his household came with jacob the first thing as part of redemption is predestination this man has been preaching predestination he's trying to show you that predestination is a part of redemption that is that okay if i say it that way so you may say man this guy 28 times he repeats himself most of you ain't here two services in a row it took me seven services to preach third pool because i had two or three visitors and the people that are there ain't there half the time i told the people at our church you know what some of you are got a 33 chance of making the rapture because all you come to church is one out of three services amen brother baby said every every service could determine your final destiny exactly every service could determine your final destiny god's trying to get you this revelation of the book of redemption and you won't even show up to hear it amen amen if if i announced that in this afternoon service jesus christ would be here how many of you would be here i'm announcing he is going to be here he's here now and he's going to yeah he's going to be here this afternoon too so why are you missing scripture says to gather gather even more as you see the day appearing amen see it's these little things are going to get you that's right little foxes spoil the line okay i'm probably i don't know how much i'm going but i want to show you right at the beginning of a predestination it just blew me away then chapter six it rolls back into it again it says these are the names that went down into israel now in chapter six these are the names we were born down in israel i thought wow predestination so as a part of the book of redemption exodus predestination is clearly stated right okay and one thing i really i told him and you need to understand the book of life you really do but it comes down in pharaoh when moses came down to the people in egypt their burdens got greater sure you know what most people think when they come to the message they're coming it's going to be a flowery bed of ease and brother branham said if you packed for a picnic you packed wrong he said you better pack for a battle because when you come to this message pharaoh the devil is going to be after your hide as a matter of fact when moses come down there to egypt do you know they used to give them the straw and after that they said you go fetch your own straw the burdens when brother random come on into my life the battle got fiercer that's why i said it earlier that every devil in hell every gun's aimed at the bride so when you come to redemption when you're sitting here and you're going through the journey of redemption it is a harder battle than if you're not in it right does everybody understand that so in the book of exodus it'll show you the conditions that brother ram said of the re of redemption you understand and we're in a time of redemption now we're fixing to get out of here in a rapture that's an axis we understand that so the conditions that were back there the conditions that were in jesus day are the conditions that's in this hour the one quote i read you know who gave moses the most trouble 70 preachers who gave jesus the most trouble in that exodus describes the pharisees the religious order come on in this hour i read a quote the other day brother evan said i have not found one minister yet that agreed with me on serpent seed right exactly brother what did brother say the ones who give me in trouble are the preachers you know who'll get you in trouble preachers that's why you better check it look faith final resting place is in this if you're going to start taking a look at brother man's natural life he failed he was a man but if you start taking a look at thus saith the lord you'll see how god sent this prophet to take us out on an exodus if you start looking at this man's failures you're going to miss it but you better listen to what he says because god sent you a fivefold ministry to preach you the word to feed you the word a shepherd feeds you the word he don't rule over you he feeds you the word that's how this man is your shepherd right i'm not a dictator i don't have a nickelodeon spirit right i have never said in our church you've got to come here come on brother i don't have a nicolae in spirit but you got to come to the truth wherever the truth is you better come there because the truth is what's going to set you free now i'm going to go back to third exits just i know some new ones here so you i won't lose you the first exodus took israel out of natural egypt to a natural israel the second one brother brahm said the second exodus was with jesus christ so you've got to identify what was happening in the time of jesus moses wrote five books in the bible the pentateuch does everybody understand that and i don't remember which i get them confused i don't i can't for some reason i can't keep that straight there's a talmud and a torah does everybody understand that one of them's the five books of moses the other is 316 do's and don'ts that the scribes and pharisees come up it was burdens that the priest put on the people does everybody understand that and so what happened in jesus day he was taking them out of judaism judaism is the spirit where they took the five books and started putting grievous things on the people the do's and don'ts and all those things you understand that's what it was about so what god was taking israel out at the time of jesus he was taking them out of judaism right into a church is that what brother and said because why he's starting to church ages it's a dispensational change he's bringing them to a church now brother branham came in this hour to take us out of a church into a bride now i'm going to say it anything that's got an ism on the end of it it's a spirit right brother said communism is a spirit nazism is a spirit right catholicism is a spirit right denominationalism is a spirit right so brother said another quote he took us out of denominationalism into the bride is that right amen so we were we were plainly by the identifying the messenger by identifying what his message was we're thoroughly identified that we have entered into that third exodus and it's in the scriptures we don't just brother ram didn't hatch that up neither did we exactly everything we do daniel's 70 weeks is based off the scriptures everything we do faith final resting place revelation faith is the same word as revelation right revelations final resting place is in the word you know brother jess my old pastor used to tell him he said you got a revelation read it to me right yeah is that fair right if the mysteries were finished i told the church this in the days of the voice the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god if i say the mystery of the word are you bugged out about it god here's the word in the beginning was the word where's with god the word was god the mystery of the word's finished i tell our church if some preacher comes here and preaches you a mystery run for your life if they preach you a revelation of the mystery okay amen well what we got in the message is preachers that come and preach another you know they preach a mystery exactly look the mysteries are what's binding up the revelation is what's going to set you free they're not going to take me back to egypt i'm going to tell you that right now they're not going to take me back to denominationalism amen the denominationalism had us all bound down in this hour brother said denominationalism had this holy spirit bound through the church that's why we had to experience revelation 4 a rapture does everybody understand that which is a catchy way pulling out of the church into the bride now we've entered into what the bright age i wonder brother brahm said we're in the bright age why because if you experience revelation four you're in the bride because what does this say after this after the church age come up hither that's where if your bride you're sitting you're come up hither you've got a revelation that so supersedes the church denominationalism and i'm not trying to say we're know-it-alls we're not that but look as part of the exodus would of israel come out of egypt if they wouldn't have accepted moses no so a part of redemption for israel a part of the uh redemption for them to come out of judea it was accepting jesus their prophet the god prophet exactly so the conditions are the same in this hour you got to understand predestination you've got to understand that god if god does anything amos 3 7 he first declareth his secret things his mysteries to his servants the prophets so god has sent a prophet in this hour and i'm not ashamed to say his name i'm not right because i see it in the word amen it wasn't just the the first pull and second boy it was a sign but it had a voice to it that told me god has a restoration going on now and i want to be a part of it and not only that if you don't get this prophet you're doomed right brother said there's people walking the earth now that are cannon fodder well you know abraham could have said that in his hour so brother ram says it's gonna bug you out when he had the same sign right and the sign will had a voice to it that we're in a time of doom here you better get them out you better start you know in revelation 10 it's brother and said you're a little redeemer brother redeemer did he say that that's why in chapter 10 it tells us you're supposed to you've got an open book what's open the mysteries the book of redemptions open to you what are you supposed to do you ate the book and you're supposed to go give them the book now that's what's going to take a rapture that's what's going to get every nation kindred tongue just telling them god sent a prophet ain't good enough you've got to tell them what the prophet said what are these mysteries we're talking about we got preachers in a message afraid to preach the mysteries it just irritates me they keep the people from the raptures what they're doing that's what's going to get you out of here the revelation of these things no wonder he told israel you're going to know it that's the important part i'm going to do it the lord but you're going to know what i've done that's what you got to know in this hour god's doing the work and you've got to know what he's doing and if your name's on the book you will know what he's doing it'll be revealed to you because he said father all that thou hast given me all the ones that are on the name of book of life right father all thou hast given me shall come to me is that right and i'll not lose a one exactly amen now see predestination what he's meant god could look for it in foreknowledge and know who would accept it and who wouldn't when the gospel the mysteries the word the revelation of the hour come before you god knew who would accept and who would reject it if you reject it your name's not on the book i don't know how else to say it but if you accept it and you go all the way then your name's on the lamb's book of life is that right glory well we're in a serious hour this is what we're doing now is life and death for the gentile people we're at the end of the road by that melchizedek sign that was given to brother adam of discerning the thought and intent of the heart it's showing you the gentile kingdom has come to an end we're at the very end of time we're there i'm not looking for another mystery to be revealed they were all revealed through this prophet now do i catch your revelation every time i read a book yep there's revelation scripture says god's pathfinder now right you know i'm going to be in eternity god's eternal right if he's eternal he's constantly revealing himself amen on the other side do you realize god's going to be constantly revealing himself to us what you've got here is just a small part of what you're going to get over there and i don't know about you but when i get revelation i'm a happy man have you ever had a preacher preach something you don't understand it you get mad some of you may get mad at me today but you know he'll preach it again don't get too mad keep coming he'll break it down for you i took 20 parts to do this at our church i'm trying to do it in two here so i told brother it made me a nervous wreck i told him i've been more nervous with this than i've ever preached here because you hate to leave people lie hanging do you understand what i'm saying because as ministers we don't want to do that we want to absolutely show them these mysteries that's been given in this hour right that's what we want to do we want to preach the mysteries don't you exactly but boy if you preach the mysteries the message preachers get mad at you now they think you know it all i had one guy say i'm going to say who said oh brother samuel cabbage down on daniel 70 weeks i said really you think that yeah i said have you went out to his internet site and seen what he's preaching yeah he looked at me kind of funny i said go look at it i did the other day i said he's been preaching on revelation the book of symbols he's been preaching on predestination he preached a half year on another series he did i said when has he been preached on daniel 70 weeks right if he's cabbage down on it why wouldn't he just name him okay daniel 70 weeks that was the dumbest statement i've ever heard i looked at him i said do you really believe that i said you need to go look at his internet site and the guy's eyes change i can see him change because i told him the truth that's what they heard somebody say right exactly and i'll be honest with you i've had preachers come to me and talk about preachers say well this preacher i said can you get the cd yeah i said would you send it to me you know what one of them sent me a cd yet i will not take a word against a preacher from another person i gotta i gotta grind it up my own grinders i want to hear it for myself right if somebody says he said something then you let me hear it i always say i look them i said can you give me the cd they say yeah i said would you send it to me three of them i've done that dude i haven't walked out one yet i'm not interested in their opinion you see what i'm saying well there's some that's do i got till 12 okay boy you got me messed up now i knew the pressure to come i didn't know it'd be today but it talks about you know pharaoh put an edict forth that all the children israel the men child that were born were to be killed is that right right everybody agree with that sure and they did and brother am typed to this today in chicago he said one month 25 000 abortions are done do you know what they were really doing back then they were aborting children in that exodus do you agree they they would take the children they'd smack their head against wall and throw them to the gators this is the hour of abortions does everybody it's it's showing you in the scripture we're at a time of an exodus now you've got to admit it's true abortion's everywhere is that right then we go on and read we see where pharaoh's daughter do you know in chapter one at the end of it i think it is he says that all the male children they were born to the israelites because the midwives wouldn't kill them right they wouldn't do it they said we're doing that but what they did they said all the children all the israelites or all the egyptians if they got a male child is born kill them right so pharaoh's daughter's out bathing in the nile river a baby comes up there right they heard a cry she sent one of the maidens out there one of her servants to go get it she brought it back and that is that pharaoh's daughter looked at that baby and said this is one of the hebrew children and pharaoh had already commissioned every one of them to kill them but it said pharaoh's daughter had compassion on that baby and raised the baby as her own do you know she if pharaoh would have known darrell would have killed her does everybody understand that she said oh this is one of those hebrew children you know what i believe her name's on the book of life i said that here when i preached the other day the preacher said well that's your opinion i thought it is my opinion you know what you say where do i get it brother and said those who are good to the bride their name won't come off the book of life is that right amen that little girl favor you mean god had somebody on a book of life stuck right under pharaoh's nose i believe it she loved that little she said she had compassion do you think she won't get a reward for that she raised and looked over that little baby for how many years i in my and i might when i seen that i something spoke to my heart and said that's the book of life right so who you know you better be careful with your badmouth one thing i've learned about the book of life there's people out there in the church world justified and sanctified some of them you better be careful who you put your mouth on brother brandon said at the white throne judgment multitudes of them will come up there am i saying if you belong to a dominance church you're just no i'm saying there's brother bram said there's christians everywhere he said there's christians don't even go to church let's quote isn't it so i'm not here to judge that all i'm telling you is there's a group of people that's going on in exodus who got all they got to profit they got predestination they got the book of life figured out does everybody understand that and it goes on to chapter four there's twice where you know what he said to moses he said you know what moses i'll put words in your mouth does that sound like the third pool to you you speak it i'll perform it it ain't you speaking it's him speaking amen you really started understanding the third pool it ain't i'm gonna give you something before this morning think about chew on i had a guy that came to my church or it wasn't my church then it was a deacon then we went out to wendy's to eat one day and i got a chicken i like that spicy hot chicken you know number six so i had that and this guy stood up and said you know one day brother claude we'll speak a chicken sandwich into existence there's something inside of me and it didn't come from here or my spirit realm this came from way down and this voice said to me he's yet carnal see we talk about that in third pool it's gonna be different what you think right exactly exactly right ain't some hatched-up idea you got right god's gonna speak it through you is what it's gonna be that's what the third bull is all about amen in chapter 4 you go look at it it says moses i want you to teach them but i'm going to speak through you is what i'm going to do does everybody understand that right brother god performed the opening word with brother bran and brett brown was just a microphone god spoke through him brother bannon was so consecrated where the third pool could work in his life i'm going to ask you guys something are you concentrating enough where it's going to work in your life because there's come in an hour soon that you're going to need it it soon appoints people it's going to happen quicker than you think and you better be ready for this thing you better understand the mysteries you better understand them right because it's going to come in real handy when the pressure comes down it really is i'm just warning you and i'm going to talk about seven to really bear it down for you but so teaching's a big part of the redemption of the exodus does everybody agree with that right and there were plagues involved in it do you understand the children of israel there were ten plagues three of plagues fell while israel was in egypt did you know in 1918 brother braham said influenza was one of the plagues in the scripture in revelation it says the seven last plagues is that what it says in the in the exodus then there were ten flags three of them fell while they were there you understand the seven of them fell when they were in the ocean when they were separated right right so you need to understand what scripture says plagues are falling now people i'm going to tell you the plagues are falling now we're going to see some of them but we ain't going to see those those bad ones that are coming down those two prophets that go to israel going to call them down on the gentile people i understand what those plagues are they're going to call them down does everybody agree brother bam said it those two prophets said go to israel what what did moses do he called the plagues down on egypt god's going to send moses and elijah to the jews and moses is going to call the plagues down on the gentile people while god's trying to steal 144 000 is that right that's what he says in daniel 70 weeks don't he say it exactly what do these guys do with those quotes i haven't figured it out yet do you what i really wanted what i wanted to get to today i want you guys to go to the those five books start reading them and you're gonna you if you get it right the mystery of them you're gonna understand we're in that hour of redemption right we're on a journey we're well to the end of it now can i say it that way exactly we're well to the end of it i really didn't talk about third pool much that's what i want to talk about this afternoon we were at the ministers meeting yesterday and they said okay what do you guys want to talk about and the guy said well they said well one that i man i thought why do they want to know about that one did you understand that first one they had it's like wow i don't know what that's got to do but anyway and they had another one and brother raised and said well i want to talk about the third pull the plan and purpose that's what i'm going to talk about this afternoon somebody said something yesterday that really startled me they said today remember it was 50 years ago right i believe it's right i don't know somebody said it so i have a very his souls were in prison was preached i think it's time for the third pool to start working amongst this the preacher said it's the season of the third pool i believe it it's already been working in us you go look at the quotes brother brahm said it it really is right i'm gonna stop there i got 10 minutes but i'm going to leave you but i just want to let you know that a big part of redemption let me not let you go yet let me read let's go to malachi 4. would you do that please you know what upsets me so bad is a man could be in the message for 40 or 30 or 40 years and deny that brother branham was a prophet okay i just don't get it i can't even go there i can't even can you if i try to put myself in another guy's moccasins like brother brahm said i can't go there folks i'm sorry i just can't let's read malachi 4. for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yea and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and that that in the day that cometh shall burn them up saith the lord of hosts and it shall leave them neither root or branch remember what i said about that pool of discernment what it was sodom burn up right so this messenger of malachi 4 this elijah i'm going to tell you who he is william marion branham after he ministers this thing's going to be burnt up and we have a sign that was given that has a voice that that melchizedek sign was given in this hour right but unto you that fear my name now if you go to chapter six and i don't know if you know this i gotta hurry i'm gonna finish it 12. if you go look at the the exodus out of israel in six before 6 6 about 6 3 it says i'm going to give you a name and it's going to be jehovah is that what he said now that name jehovah was only mentioned once in the scripture before and that was in abraham's time and he was known in part under abraham who abraham was a type of justification is that what brother anderson he knew him as jehovah jireh the provider right right but he never knew jehovah is fullest of redemption when you go out there and you look it's capital j e h o v a h jehovah was known in the fullness of redemption and moses preached it did he not did they have healing sure he said i am the lord thy god that healeth all thy disease was he their banner yes he was the so in that first exodus what was god showing the fullness of redemption does everybody understand that right by the very name jehovah alone he's showing the full seven redemptive names of jehovah whereas he never displayed that in the old testament before then right but during the time of the exodus god absolutely reveals himself as jehovah to him he even said my name's jehovah does anybody know jehovah there's no i'm going to say this it's going to blow your mind a little bit there's no such word as jehovah the vows were added so you could say it you know that exactly you click on the word in jehovah in the bible they say you couldn't say jehovah he would take the vows out j what is it j h v h v did anybody say that i challenged everybody in my church they couldn't say it either right right the name wasn't really fully they knew the redemptive part of it does everybody understand that it is in the redemptive plan he displayed himself as healer as as jira when they needed quail did he provide quail so as that exodus there was a fullness of redemption that was revealed to these people and i think people come and say well it's jehovah witness it's got to be jehovah not jesus jehovah's not even a name it's a name but they couldn't say it right exactly right but this hour in in 117 and matthew when he was born in his name she was going to be called capital j e s-u-s now we know well we know the name that's why brother branham could tell us in this hour we have the fullness of redemption with a name no other names higher in heaven whatsoever you ask in my name it shall be given unto you there's no doubt in that that's faith buddy in that name right so we have been delivered in this hour they had jehovah we got jesus jehovah the old testament is jesus the name it's showing you we're going out on an exodus the very revealing of that name in its fullness shows you we're right in a rapture state in an exodus right okay let's read on with malachi here front you that fear my name shall the son of righteous arrive with healing in his wings right so when healing strikes the earth what does it mean restoration this prophet will be a restoration prophet amen okay excuse me and you shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall and you shall tread down the wicked i like that right says ye that's you guys shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in a day that i shall do this saith the lord of hosts and i like this 4 4 remember ye the law of moses you know there's two parts that this messenger are supposed to do return your faith back to the apostolic fathers exactly do you know what the faith the apostolics and fathers were the law right you ever think of that that's all they had was law right jesus said i didn't come to do away with the law i came to fulfill the law jesus christ that body manifested in the flesh was the fulfillment of all that the prophets he spoke isaiah 946 isaiah 7 14 was he he was the fullness as i said of the godhead bodily amen so you see every time there's an exodus there's a fullness that comes forth amen jehovah was known in the fullness under that right if you go read that it said now they didn't know me before is jehovah right they knew me as god almighty which was what elohim self-existing one jehovah now he was with his family he was existing where he was their healer he performed the seven redemptive names on israel you take through the exodus and prove that he performed every one of the seven redemptive names of job right right and now who do we have in our midst now jesus as this the fullness of g the fullness of the word resist exists among the bride you're not going to take redemption without fullness i'm just going to be honest with you you're not going to get back you're not going to get a body change without fullness and that's why you go to exodus and you look at it it shows you the conditions of where we're at it spells it out brother now this one says remember ye the law of moses two things brother bran is supposed to do return our heart back to the apostolic fathers the law all right go to any nominal church huh and i read to you and i told that this morning from deuteronomy 22 5 1 8 was supposed to wear that pertaining to a man and a pants were entertained to a man i don't care what you say they'll say make girls pants well go go to the bathrooms in walmart does it show a woman with a dress on her pants there's a reason for that that's not an accident right that's right right i don't believe in unisex i'm sorry i don't me and my wife are quite different trust me i told the church the other day i figured out what 50 50 was 50 of the time you're happy and fifty percent of time you're mad in a marriage they all laughed they said i don't think you got it yet i said well i thought i might have it but the 50 that's good is real good sister when you get 50 that's good it's way good it makes up for the 50 bad so you got to remember the law of moses is that right right that's what he did that's what brother amy he took us back to the what the faith of the apostolic the law see we didn't this church does anybody here do away with any of the law of the old testament no we fulfill it right we fulfill the is what we do that's what jesus did the second thing he was supposed to do right is what to reveal the thunders that were contained under the seal and this is what literally returned your hearts back to him what is the thunders the mysteries what is the mysteries the book of redemption amen exactly what's the what's the job of this prophet in this hour will you america to reveal the mysteries right amen the book of redemption to a group of people that's right amen and those that get that the fullness of the word they're going to take a rapture but without that no rapture right we'll get in more detail this afternoon lord bless you go back and read those five books though okay i'll be honest with you i'm going to go back he's he's doing predestination and i've i've done ruth i've done part of revelations and i'm going to do ephesians but how do you do officials and not preach predestination so what this guy's doing he's preaching this guy is preaching the mysteries to you this guy right here is preaching the book of redemption to you when he preaches mysteries he's preaching the book of redemption amen right remember that it's a mysterious book the book of redemption amen and i thank god when you get a preacher like this that preaches the mysteries you ought to pray for this man every day you ought to thank god that he's gave you a ministry in this church like this that'll preach the mysteries to you amen let's stand together can you say amen to the message amen yes sir so let's just say i love him we will take the music with this thing i love him anybody has a need you ought to be open because we don't want to leave it without giving you an opportunity all right i love him i love him because he first loved me and per just my salvation of wreath now if you need healing saying it this way he heals me he heals me because he first loved me and what and by his stride i'm healed completely let's pray one for another remember to brother this afternoon remember the services you're dismissed take the name of jesus it
