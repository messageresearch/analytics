[0:00] for this morning.
[0:02] Good to see everybody. Good to have my
[0:04] mom and my sister Nicole with us this
[0:07] morning. Good to see each
[0:09] one. So, uh let's just speak to the
[0:12] author before we get started this
[0:14] morning. Heavenly Father, we thank you
[0:16] for this time, Lord, that we're able to
[0:18] gather in your house, Lord. We thank you
[0:19] for be able to gather with our brothers
[0:22] and sisters like precious faith this
[0:24] morning, Lord Jesus. We just pray that
[0:25] you bless us this morning as we look
[0:28] into your word this morning, this little
[0:29] study. We just pray that you give us the
[0:31] words to be said. Lord, just anoint us
[0:35] this morning. Bless our brother Bob as
[0:37] he comes to bring the word to us today.
[0:39] And Lord, bless each part of this
[0:41] service. Lord, bless the ones that
[0:43] couldn't be here this morning. Be with
[0:45] them. Touch those that are sick and need
[0:48] a touch from you. We ask all these
[0:51] things in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[0:53] Amen.
[0:55] Amen. This morning we'll start with
[0:57] Matthew chapter
[1:00] 13. Begin at verse
[1:03] three. And it says, "And he spake many
[1:06] things unto them in parables, saying,
[1:08] Behold, a sewer went forth to sew. And
[1:10] when he had sowed, some seeds fell by
[1:13] the wayside, and the fowls came and
[1:15] devoured them up. Some fell upon stony
[1:18] places where they had not much earth
[1:20] wherewith they sprang up because they
[1:22] had no deepness of earth. And when the
[1:25] sun was up, they were scorched, and
[1:28] because they had had no root, they
[1:30] withered away. And some fell among
[1:33] thorns, and the thorns sprung up and
[1:34] choked them. But other fell into good
[1:37] ground and brought forth fruit, some
[1:39] 100fold, some 60fold, and some 30fold.
[1:43] Who hath ears to hear, let him
[1:46] hear. This morning I want to talk about
[1:49] having good
[1:51] ground for the seed or the word to fall
[1:54] into.
[1:57] You know, when you when you look at
[1:58] this, and there's many different
[2:01] scriptures I want to look at this
[2:02] morning, but um one of the first ones
[2:05] that I thought about when you look at
[2:07] this, I was thinking about where Jesus
[2:10] there in in Luke 9 where there was a a
[2:15] man that came to Jesus and the scripture
[2:17] tells us that he came and he said,
[2:19] "Lord, I'll follow thee wherever you
[2:20] wherever you goest."
[2:23] And Jesus told him, he said, "Foxes have
[2:25] holes. Birds have have nests, have birds
[2:30] of the air have nests." But he said,
[2:31] "The Son of man hath no place to lay his
[2:33] head."
[2:35] And he said unto another, "Follow me."
[2:37] But he said, "Lord, suffer me first to
[2:39] go and bury my
[2:40] father." Jesus said unto him, "Let the
[2:43] dead bury the dead, but go thou and
[2:45] preach the kingdom of God." But another
[2:47] one also said,"Lord, I will follow thee,
[2:50] but let me first go bid them
[2:53] farewell, which are at my home, at my
[2:56] house." And Jesus said unto him, "No man
[3:00] having put his hand to the plow, looking
[3:02] back is fit for the kingdom of God."
[3:05] Amen. And you know when you when you
[3:07] look at preparing the ground and and
[3:11] doing the work of the kingdom of God,
[3:13] you know, the first thing that naturally
[3:16] we have to do is, you know, you got to
[3:18] you got to break the ground. You got to
[3:20] plow the ground this time of of year. I
[3:22] guess most people have already started
[3:24] planting and getting all that, but you
[3:26] know, the first thing you got to do is
[3:27] you got to get in there and break the
[3:28] ground up. It's hard. It's difficult.
[3:30] And that's a lot of work that you got to
[3:32] break it up. And you got to turn that
[3:34] turn that disc and break all that ground
[3:37] up, get it all turned over. But, you
[3:39] know, after you get that thing broke,
[3:41] that's not the end of it. You know, the
[3:43] next thing you know, you come through
[3:44] with a harrow and, you know, you start
[3:46] breaking all the larger clumps up.
[3:48] You're just trying to break it down into
[3:49] a fine, better soil where it's easier,
[3:52] not all those big clumps, but you want
[3:54] it broke down where it's actually able
[3:56] to plant something where it actually
[3:58] receives the water, it receives
[4:00] nutrients, the fertilizer, all those
[4:02] type things. So you want it to be at a
[4:04] place where it'll actually able to put
[4:07] seed in the ground because you know
[4:09] brother Brown talks about the story
[4:11] there in in Finland. you know, those
[4:13] people that, you know, because the storm
[4:15] and uh the weather getting close to snow
[4:19] time, you know, the winter, you know, he
[4:21] said they were just out there just
[4:22] trying to put plant that seed in the
[4:24] ground. And, you know, they were out
[4:25] there and they were just scraping the
[4:27] ground just a little bit, trying to put
[4:29] seed in the ground, just trying because,
[4:30] you know, they were in desperate need.
[4:32] And, you know, he said they were out
[4:34] there, the children were out there with
[4:35] lanterns going before their parents.
[4:37] They're just out there trying to scrape
[4:38] the ground, trying to get seed in the
[4:40] ground.
[4:41] you know, because they saw that the need
[4:43] was to get the seed planted and and they
[4:46] didn't have the time. But, you know,
[4:49] while we have time, it it's it's it
[4:51] behooves us to take the time to plant to
[4:54] get everything properly set for the word
[4:57] of God. And, you know, he said, you
[4:59] know, you you tear tear all that up. You
[5:01] break up the ground. You get it all
[5:02] ready for the for the planting. But you
[5:05] know, brother Bram says, you know, as
[5:08] the scripture says here, you know, Jesus
[5:10] telling him, he said, you know, if you
[5:12] put your hand to the plow, he said,
[5:15] don't look back. That's right. Don't
[5:16] look back. He said, you you don't have
[5:19] um if you're if you look back, he said,
[5:22] you're not worthy of of the work. You're
[5:24] not worthy of the kingdom. And you know,
[5:27] Brother Brown talks about many times,
[5:28] you know, talking about just staying
[5:30] focused. One time he said, you know, we
[5:32] got to keep our hearts and our minds
[5:33] single. We got to keep straight on what
[5:35] we're doing. And you know, when you when
[5:37] you look at that, if anybody's ever
[5:38] tried to plow, and the only thing I've
[5:41] ever I've run a tiller, I ain't never
[5:42] really tried to plow. I've seen people
[5:44] I've seen people work with a mule and
[5:47] and plow the ground. And I tell you
[5:49] what, I just watched them and and that
[5:51] that's that's difficult just to watch. I
[5:53] mean, that's that's work, right? I mean,
[5:55] you know, make you want to sweat just
[5:57] watching them, right? I mean, that's
[5:58] that's work. And you know, u you know,
[6:02] like some people say, I like work. I can
[6:03] sit and watch it all day. Well, that's
[6:05] not the kind of work I want to sit and
[6:07] watch all day. That that's that's that's
[6:09] work. And you know, Brother Brown
[6:11] talking about, you know, having the
[6:12] strap and plowing in the field. And he
[6:15] said that strap would cut into your neck
[6:18] and you know, out there in the hot sun,
[6:19] you're busting all that up, but you
[6:21] know, you know, you've got to get in
[6:22] there and do that work. And he said it's
[6:24] got to be thoroughly prepared. And they
[6:26] said, you know, the one thing is is if
[6:28] you're out plowing, you got to keep your
[6:30] eye on what you're doing. You can't be
[6:32] off and because, you know, if you're
[6:33] looking back and paying attention to
[6:35] other things, you know, you're not
[6:36] plowing the ground because you're all
[6:38] over the map. You know, you're not in
[6:39] the field, you're going this way and
[6:41] that way, and then you got to go back
[6:42] and try to start over and because, but
[6:44] if you're keeping your eye on what
[6:46] you're doing, then the ground gets
[6:48] thoroughly busted. It gets thoroughly
[6:50] turned over and you see how it goes. And
[6:52] you know, Brother Ram said one time, he
[6:53] said, you know, said, "Circumcise the
[6:56] heart of the people." And he said, "Let
[6:58] it fall on good fertile grounds on
[7:01] penitent hearts." Amen. And so when we
[7:04] see how we in the in the natural how you
[7:07] have to bust the ground up and get it
[7:08] all prepared. Well, it's the same way in
[7:10] the spiritual that you have to get these
[7:12] things ready to go and you know prepare
[7:14] ourselves and you know there there's you
[7:16] know we do many things that brother
[7:18] Brown talked about but uh you know he
[7:21] said keep your eye on the task at hand.
[7:23] and said, "And and looking unto Jesus,
[7:26] the author and the finish of our faith,
[7:28] looking to the future." Amen. And so we
[7:31] we look to the future to see the things
[7:33] that has to be done now because we don't
[7:35] know as we see the the time and hour
[7:38] that we live in today. We don't know how
[7:39] much longer we have, but now's the time
[7:41] that if if we start to see these things
[7:44] because as I was speaking to somebody
[7:46] the other day, you know, we we've held
[7:48] on to these things for so long and
[7:50] people's like, well, you know, as as
[7:52] just like Peter was talking about, you
[7:54] know, things have continued on as they
[7:56] were and you know, people where's
[7:57] where's the sign of his coming and all
[7:59] these type things. Hey, we're seeing the
[8:01] signs of his coming every day. We we're
[8:03] starting to see these things. But, you
[8:05] know, just because you see the things
[8:07] taking place that Brother Brandham spoke
[8:09] about. You know, that doesn't make us
[8:11] right. Doesn't because you know what it
[8:13] takes it it's something just because you
[8:15] see the signs of the time and the things
[8:17] that are happening. You know, that's not
[8:18] going to put you in the rapture. That's
[8:20] not going to give you the new birth.
[8:21] It's something that takes place. You've
[8:23] got to have your own individual
[8:24] experience with God to get to the place
[8:26] where you've got to get the things that
[8:28] you see that's not right in your life to
[8:30] get those things out. And you've got to
[8:33] you've got to because you know we we
[8:35] like to think sometimes that um we're
[8:39] okay. We think everything's going to be
[8:42] okay. We're okay. But you know sometimes
[8:44] when things happen, it begins to show
[8:46] things in our lives. the things that
[8:48] we've got to get taken care of because
[8:50] we realize, you know, as the word goes
[8:53] forth sometimes it shows, you know,
[8:55] we're not where we think we are or what
[8:57] where we need to be. But you
[9:00] know, reading here in the scripture, I
[9:02] was reading this commentary and and it
[9:04] says reading reading the scripture here
[9:07] and and this passage on Jesus plowing
[9:11] the field and he said, you know, if you
[9:13] put your hand to the plow and look back
[9:16] said, you're not worthy of the kingdom.
[9:17] And he says the passage emphasizes the
[9:19] need of unwavering commitment and focus
[9:22] when following Jesus and serving in his
[9:24] kingdom as looking back at past
[9:27] commitments or concerns can hinder
[9:29] progress. Because you know if we keep
[9:31] looking back and you know that's one
[9:33] thing that even the apostle Paul talked
[9:35] about. He said not looking back we're
[9:36] not looking back at things. He said I'm
[9:38] pressing toward the mark of the high
[9:39] calling. I said I'm pressing toward the
[9:41] prize. See I'm looking toward what's in
[9:44] front of me. not looking back at the
[9:46] things because if you see the things
[9:47] because we we get wrapped up in things
[9:49] that have happened in the past or we
[9:51] worry about things here or there if
[9:53] we're not focused on what God has and
[9:57] one of the things that brother Brown was
[9:58] talking about about sewing seed and you
[10:00] know he's like you know our our job is
[10:02] to seow seed he said but God it's God's
[10:06] job to do the rest of it you know so we
[10:08] just sew the seed but you know if you
[10:10] see this when you see the the seed going
[10:12] forward we have to prepare ourselves for
[10:14] this and you know later in in Matthew
[10:17] chapter 13 he Jesus is telling when he
[10:20] when the disciples ask him about the
[10:22] story about the ser and he tells him he
[10:25] says you know that the sto the
[10:28] swer he says you
[10:30] know he said therefore the parable of
[10:33] the swer here therefore the parable of
[10:35] swer he said when anyone heareth the
[10:38] word of the kingdom and understandeth it
[10:40] not then cometh the wicked woman and
[10:42] catch away catch away that which was
[10:45] sown in his heart. This is he which
[10:47] receives seed by the
[10:49] wayside. And when that received when he
[10:53] that received the seed in the stony
[10:54] places, the same as he that heareth the
[10:56] word, and a non with joy receiveth it,
[10:59] yet hath not he not any root in himself,
[11:02] but dareth for a while. For when
[11:05] tribulation or persecution arises
[11:07] because of the word, by and by he is
[11:09] offended. He also that receiveth seed
[11:12] among the thorns is he that heareth the
[11:14] word and the care of this world. And the
[11:17] deceitfulness of riches choke the word,
[11:20] and he becometh unfruitful. But he that
[11:23] receiveth seed into the good ground is
[11:26] he that heareth the word and
[11:28] understandeth it, which also beareth
[11:31] fruit and bringeth forth, some hundfold,
[11:34] some 60, and some 30.
[11:38] And so you you see that as the word goes
[11:40] forth, there are some that hear the word
[11:43] but it doesn't fall in the right ground
[11:46] because you know they hear the word and
[11:48] they rejoice in the word but because of
[11:51] the things that come in and like many
[11:55] times he said you know because they
[11:58] don't understand it. Well, sometimes the
[12:02] problem is is you know my experience is
[12:05] I've held on to held on to things that
[12:07] the prophet said, things I've read in
[12:09] the scripture I didn't understand for a
[12:10] long time. Amen. But you know I didn't
[12:12] but you know I realized that one day I
[12:14] just I just put it in the hands of God
[12:16] and realize you know one day God will
[12:17] reveal it to me. Amen. And you know many
[12:20] times people you know if they don't
[12:22] understand it they try to figure it out
[12:23] on their own.
[12:25] And the problem is is see then that's
[12:27] the way that Satan can get into things
[12:29] because people are not relying on God
[12:32] and say just like you know I appreciate
[12:34] brother Brown standing up when people
[12:36] ask him questions and the first thing
[12:37] out of his mouth is I don't know
[12:40] appreciate the you know and then brother
[12:42] Dale used to say you I I told him I I
[12:44] still tell the story about the first
[12:46] time I talked to brother Dale and asked
[12:48] him a question and he told me he said I
[12:50] don't know I said well that's a red
[12:51] letter day on the calendar we need to
[12:53] write that down somebody asked asked
[12:54] brother Dale a question and and he said
[12:56] I don't know. It's like really because
[12:59] you know everybody thought well brother
[13:00] Dell had all the answers. Well, you
[13:01] know, he didn't have all the answers,
[13:03] but we do have one that has all the
[13:05] answers. And you know, in time, he does.
[13:07] But you know, the thing is realize I
[13:09] know what God has revealed to me, but I
[13:12] don't know these things. But you know
[13:13] what? We held on because the Bible says,
[13:15] the scripture tells us, the prophet told
[13:17] us that a real true eagle will
[13:19] understand. In time, God will reveal his
[13:22] word to us because that is that is what
[13:25] he has called us to do is receive this
[13:27] word and you just hold on. But the
[13:30] problem is it's like I don't know. But
[13:32] you know what? I'm holding on because I
[13:33] know what the prophet said. I know what
[13:35] the scriptures say. And just because I
[13:37] don't understand it don't mean I don't
[13:39] believe it. And you know what? I can
[13:41] trust trust in God. And if it takes if
[13:44] it takes two weeks, if it takes two
[13:46] years, if it takes 20 years, I don't
[13:48] care because I put my confidence in God.
[13:51] And I'm just waiting on him to reveal it
[13:53] to me because it'll come one of these
[13:55] days and I don't have to worry about it.
[13:57] And you know, if the Satan will try to
[14:00] attack you in that, but you know what? I
[14:02] got I got my confidence in the word of
[14:04] God because you know what? He's brought
[14:05] me this far and I've seen the things
[14:07] that God has revealed to me from the
[14:09] word and and and that I've seen that
[14:11] I've held on to and you because you sit
[14:14] there and I've heard things preached and
[14:16] it didn't make any sense to me. And I
[14:17] told the Lord, I said, "Lord, if this is
[14:19] the truth, you're going to have to
[14:20] reveal it to me because it don't make
[14:21] any sense." And then you know what? you
[14:24] just hold on and praise God when God
[14:25] begins to open the word to you and show
[14:27] you these things and show you what the
[14:29] truth is that you know what you don't
[14:30] have to because you know I can drive a
[14:33] stake down right there and you know what
[14:34] I will stand on that forever because I
[14:36] know what God done for me one time and
[14:38] you know what if he's done it once in my
[14:40] life then he will always do the same
[14:42] thing because if I still meet the same
[14:43] condition I did that first time he will
[14:45] continue to do that because you know
[14:47] what he desires for you to understand
[14:49] the word for you to have a revelation of
[14:51] the word that's the desire of his heart
[14:53] and he wants to give you more revelation
[14:55] more than you want it for yourself. And
[14:57] when when you stop to think about that
[14:59] that God wants to give you it more, he
[15:01] wants to give you the new birth more
[15:03] than you want it for yourself. He wants
[15:06] he wants to heal you more than you want
[15:07] to be healed yourself. When you when you
[15:10] start to think about that just in our in
[15:12] our finite minds that God wants to give
[15:14] this because all of the pleasure all the
[15:17] blessings of the scripture of the word
[15:20] of God belong to you and he's given it
[15:22] to you and all you have to do is claim
[15:24] it and accept it. Right. And it I mean
[15:26] it it's it's so amazing because you know
[15:29] sometimes we
[15:31] we as as brother Brown said you know
[15:34] sight and time is our is our biggest
[15:36] enemies is God's biggest enemy because
[15:37] you know we have to deal in sight and
[15:40] time but we realize you know in in the
[15:42] mind of God it's already done. Amen.
[15:44] Right. Like brother Bram said you know
[15:46] if he was standing here this morning and
[15:48] you come up here to get healed he
[15:51] couldn't he couldn't do more for you
[15:52] than what he's already done. That's
[15:54] right. That's right. It's a finished
[15:56] work at Calvary. Amen. So if whatever
[15:59] you have need of, he's here. Amen. All
[16:02] you've got to do is receive it. Right.
[16:05] And sometimes the problem is is, you
[16:06] know, as the word goes forth, do we have
[16:09] the proper heart? Do we do we have a
[16:11] heart to receive the word this morning?
[16:14] And you know, sometimes when we hear
[16:15] things that we don't like to hear
[16:17] because, you know, sometimes it it goes
[16:18] against our our human nature. It goes
[16:21] against our our feelings. you know, it
[16:24] it you know, but you know, is it the
[16:27] truth? Is it is it is it really the
[16:30] truth of God that that's we're being
[16:32] being taught? We're are we hearing? And
[16:34] it's like sometimes, you know, it's
[16:35] like, Lord, change my attitude because
[16:37] sometimes our attitudes are not right.
[16:39] And it's and because it's like, well,
[16:41] you know, they're just they're just
[16:43] picking on me or they just point fingers
[16:45] at me. No, sometimes it's the it's God's
[16:49] love to you that you hear these things
[16:52] and God's moving in your life to show
[16:54] you these things that you're not right
[16:55] where you where you need to be and and
[16:57] you know, it's like, "Well, Lord, I want
[16:59] to be changed." Yeah. And some sometimes
[17:02] it's hard to to hear those things. It's
[17:05] it's hard sometimes to receive
[17:06] correction.
[17:09] It's you know, it's it's not always fun,
[17:12] but you know, it's it's for our good.
[17:15] Amen.
[17:17] And verse 23 there in Matthew 13 says,
[17:20] "And he that he hearth seed, he that
[17:23] receiveth seed into good ground is he
[17:25] that heareth the word and understandeth
[17:27] it, which also beareth fruit and
[17:29] bringeth forth some 100fold and some 60
[17:33] and some 30." So when you have to
[17:36] receive that word, but the first thing
[17:38] has to be done is you've got to put is
[17:40] the the field's got to be plowed. It's
[17:42] got to be it's got to be broke up. And
[17:44] you know when you when you're looking
[17:46] forward brother talking about in time-t
[17:47] tested memorials of God he was talking
[17:49] about plowing plowing the field putting
[17:51] your hand to the field the plowing and
[17:53] plowing said you not look back don't
[17:55] look back to the things and you know the
[17:57] first person that I think brother Ram
[17:59] talks about in in that story was Lot's
[18:02] wife looking back because her heart was
[18:06] in Sodom.
[18:08] Her heart was there with her children
[18:09] and all the things that she was leaving
[18:11] behind. But you know, God told him,
[18:13] said, "Listen, it's a message of
[18:16] deliverance to you to come out from
[18:18] underneath all of that, the death and
[18:20] destruction that lays there." And the
[18:23] word had went forth and sent the angels
[18:25] down there to tell Lot, it's time to go
[18:27] out. And and so when the when the word
[18:30] and they came and said, "Listen, now's
[18:32] the time to get out. You can't stay."
[18:35] And so now's the time. And I believe
[18:37] that's it's it behooves us to see the
[18:40] day and hour which we live. And that's
[18:41] exactly what we need to be doing. You
[18:44] know, we need to be redeeming the time
[18:46] because the days are evil to see the the
[18:47] hour in which we live and put our hands
[18:49] to the plow and and do the work that God
[18:51] has called us to do. But you know, have
[18:54] if you don't have a heart for that just
[18:57] like Lot, she Lot's wife, she's looking
[18:59] back. Well, you know what? She's always
[19:02] looking back. Brother Ram said there's a
[19:04] time-t tested memorial there, that
[19:06] statue, and said she's stand there
[19:08] looking over her shoulder. She's still a
[19:09] pillar of salt there even today showing
[19:12] that there's a testimony to that that
[19:14] you know because that's where her heart
[19:15] was. Her heart wasn't in the word that
[19:17] had been given to her because you know
[19:18] the rest you know Lot walked out of that
[19:21] place
[19:23] you know and and
[19:24] so thank God that that we have a message
[19:27] of deliverance. We have a message to to
[19:29] carry us out of here. You don't have to
[19:31] stay here because if you if you take
[19:33] this word and you
[19:35] know I you know people always talk about
[19:38] you know well Abraham never was in Sodom
[19:40] but Lot was and God sent a word. Well
[19:42] you know it doesn't matter where you
[19:43] start at if you receive the
[19:45] word you know it's it's not you know
[19:48] people you know people are ashamed
[19:51] because of where they end up. Well you
[19:52] know what Satan will get a hold of your
[19:54] life no matter where you're at and where
[19:56] God you know where but God can go where
[19:58] you are. Amen. and deliver you from
[20:01] whatever. Yes. And you know, there's a
[20:04] lots of people, you know, when you go to
[20:05] these uh youth camps and stuff. You
[20:08] know, that's one of the things that the
[20:09] devil likes to deal with young people on
[20:11] is, you know, that they're wrapped up in
[20:13] certain things. They're bound by certain
[20:14] things and it's like, well, they don't
[20:16] want they don't want to be, you know,
[20:17] they don't want to anybody to know. And
[20:20] it's a and it's like the devil shames
[20:22] them into this into this place where you
[20:25] know they don't want to come out from
[20:26] underneath that because they don't want
[20:28] anybody to know that I'm bound by this
[20:29] or I'm bound by that. But you know the
[20:31] greatest thing is is expose the devil or
[20:34] whatever he's trying to bind you with.
[20:37] Whatever you're bound by wherever you're
[20:38] at, whatever is binding you, then you
[20:40] need to go and expose the devil and not
[20:43] not let him have a a foothold on in on
[20:46] that. And then you go up there and
[20:47] whatever the whatever the issue is, you
[20:49] know, you see these kids, they're, you
[20:51] know, they're dealing with pornography
[20:52] or, you know, they're cutting themselves
[20:54] or what any number of things that they
[20:56] face. Well, you know what? God is there
[20:59] because when the word goes forth, the
[21:01] word is going forth to deliver you from
[21:03] that, right? you know, and and and so,
[21:05] you know, sometimes uh sometimes our
[21:07] biggest issue and you know, we think we
[21:10] think we're okay and and you know,
[21:12] sometimes we might get a little
[21:14] self-righteousness, you know, and uh
[21:17] maybe maybe the rest of you don't deal
[21:19] with that. Sometimes I do because the
[21:21] word comes forth and you know sometimes
[21:22] you realize you you know you think
[21:24] you're a little better than where you
[21:25] know than somebody else or whatever and
[21:28] you think you're a little further up the
[21:29] road than you are and then you realize
[21:31] you know I'm not where I ought to be and
[21:33] you know and you know sometimes the Lord
[21:34] sends the word and all of a sudden it
[21:36] comes to you and you you realize you
[21:38] know what I need to be more humble
[21:41] and you know but you know if the word
[21:42] goes forth then it it brings you to the
[21:44] place where you can come to that you
[21:47] know and brother Ram says see he He that
[21:49] puts his hand to the plow, even turns to
[21:51] look back, is not worthy of the plowing.
[21:54] That's true. He said, "What type of
[21:55] people should we be?" He that puts his
[21:58] hand to the plow and even, he said,
[22:00] "Don't turn back, but just but just turn
[22:04] to look back is not even worthy of
[22:06] plowing." Oh, we should keep our heart
[22:09] eyes and hearts single. He said, "No
[22:11] matter what other people do, what the
[22:13] church does, what the neighbor does,
[22:15] what anyone else does, keep your heart
[22:17] centered on Calvary. Don't ever stop to
[22:20] look back. We've got no time to look
[22:23] back.
[22:26] See, we got to get out there and get to
[22:30] the place where we need to be to get our
[22:31] hearts right with God so that when the
[22:33] word goes forth, it can find a
[22:35] place. See,
[22:38] brother, here in uh God's provided
[22:43] way, he's talking about getting getting
[22:45] the people ready. He said, "But I
[22:47] believe that what I believe that we have
[22:50] failed to get the thing that Jesus gave
[22:53] us to to the church to give to the
[22:56] people." Gave to us to give to the
[22:58] church to give to the
[22:59] people. And he said he said it's it's
[23:02] getting ready. He said, "We should know
[23:04] how to tell the people to prepare for
[23:07] this great event that's coming. If the
[23:09] coming of the Lord is so great, it's the
[23:11] most essential thing that we can do is
[23:14] to get the people prepared for it.
[23:17] Become because if he comes and we're not
[23:19] prepared, then we'll be left out. But he
[23:22] said we must prepare the way of the Lord
[23:24] with us, our message from him. Because
[23:28] there is a way, the scripture speaks of
[23:30] that seemth right unto a man. There is a
[23:33] way that seems all right, but the end
[23:36] thereof is the ways of death. Amen. And
[23:39] he says, "So what what if people are
[23:42] prepared in the wrong way? They're not
[23:45] prepared for the day and the hour in
[23:48] which we live." Because you know some
[23:51] people because the Satan wants to get
[23:52] you to a place where you're just in this
[23:55] leodysian spirit where you're just kind
[23:57] of rocked to sleep and you think
[23:59] everything's okay. But you know now's
[24:01] the time that if we can do anything is
[24:03] prepare our hearts and get ready. And
[24:05] Lord, when the word goes forth, we need
[24:07] we need to have a checkup today, a
[24:09] greater checkup than we've ever had in
[24:11] in any time of our life because today is
[24:13] the day of salvation. Today is the day
[24:15] that the word's going forth. And you
[24:17] know, you know, today is a day of
[24:19] checkup, but you know, tomorrow is going
[24:20] to be another day because we're going to
[24:23] be one day closer to the coming of the
[24:25] Lord. We're going to be one day closer.
[24:26] So, we need to be prepared today for
[24:29] what God has for us in store. but you
[24:31] know also tomorrow and not just wait
[24:33] till well I'm just coming to church on
[24:35] on Sundays or Wednesdays or I'm waiting
[24:37] on brother Wade to bring the word or
[24:40] anything like that if you're not
[24:41] preparing yourselves and if it's not
[24:43] something that you're doing an
[24:45] individual uh walk or having a Bible
[24:47] study for yourself or you're not praying
[24:50] you're not reading the scripture you're
[24:51] not getting it into yourself then you
[24:53] know what you're going to get left
[24:54] behind that's right because you know
[24:57] it's it's not that brother Brother Wade
[25:01] can get you in or I can get you in or
[25:03] Brother Bob can get you in. There's
[25:04] nobody can get you in. But it takes it
[25:07] takes God to do that. And you've got to
[25:09] have experience for yourself. But you've
[25:11] got to know what you've got to do to get
[25:13] yourself ready because you know if this
[25:16] morning if we don't come prayed up then
[25:20] how are we going to hear from heaven
[25:21] this morning? Because you know that's
[25:23] what brother Bram said you know he said
[25:25] if we're talking about sitting in
[25:26] heavenly places. Well, he said, you
[25:28] know, if you if I'm prayed up and you're
[25:30] prayed up, and you know, he said, then
[25:33] we can hear from heaven. Amen. But if
[25:35] we're not prepared for this morning,
[25:37] then the word can go forth and it can
[25:39] and it can speak to your neighbor. It
[25:41] can speak to your wife. It can speak to
[25:42] your husband. And you sit there and miss
[25:44] everything that God had for you this
[25:46] morning. And you won't receive anything
[25:48] this morning. And it's like, well, you
[25:49] know, that was the dest sermon I ever
[25:50] heard. Well, you know, it it might have
[25:52] been the dry sermon to you, but somebody
[25:54] else might have got their cup
[25:55] overflowing this morning, right? Amen.
[25:58] And so, are we are we have we prepared
[26:00] our hearts this morning to receive what
[26:03] God has for us this morning? I want you
[26:05] I want because that's what I I come this
[26:07] morning because you know, I realize I
[26:10] fall short.
[26:12] For all have sinned. You come short of
[26:15] the glory of the Lord. Exactly. But I'm
[26:17] here this morning. Amen.
[26:21] I want God to move this morning. Amen.
[26:23] Move on with me.
[26:26] Cuz I want to be the right kind of
[26:28] person.
[26:30] I don't want to be the same person.
[26:34] Because just like he said, you you leave
[26:35] this place better or worse, you came in
[26:37] this morning.
[26:40] And so if you if you're carrying a
[26:42] burden this morning, you're he said if
[26:46] you're sick, you know, he's by his
[26:49] stripes, you're healed. Amen. He said he
[26:52] already sent that word to
[26:56] you. This is from the his message called
[26:59] the the
[27:00] the church of the living God.
[27:03] He said he said now the seed you believe
[27:06] here who here here who are farmers every
[27:08] seed will produce if if it's in the
[27:11] right kind of ground and every promise
[27:16] every divine promise of God in the Bible
[27:18] produce if it's met in the right kind of
[27:20] heart it'll produce the promise he said
[27:23] if you need if you have a need of
[27:25] salvation believe that he saves you and
[27:27] accept his sacrificial death and you
[27:30] shall receive what you've asked For he
[27:34] said, "If you're weary and gloomy and
[27:36] feel like that everyone's against you,"
[27:39] he said, "Come unto me all ye that labor
[27:41] and are heavy laden, and I will give you
[27:43] rest." He said, "That's a seed. Accept
[27:46] it." And if you're sick, he was wounded
[27:49] for our transgressions. With his
[27:51] stripes, we're healed. Accepted. It's a
[27:53] seed. It'll produce. Amen. So whatever
[27:57] you have need of, all you got to do is
[27:58] be here this morning and send Lord send
[28:01] the Holy Spirit prepare our hearts this
[28:02] morning for the word. Lord, get our our
[28:04] hearts right, our minds right this
[28:07] morning. So when the word goes forth
[28:09] then you know then brother Bob when he
[28:11] comes this morning to preach, you know,
[28:12] then he don't have to labor to preach
[28:14] this morning. The Holy Spirit will have
[28:16] freedom this morning to move and to
[28:17] speak to your heart. And you pull on the
[28:19] gift this morning. And then whatever you
[28:21] have need of, then he'll come and
[28:22] whether it's in his notes or not, that
[28:24] doesn't matter. It'll come forth and
[28:26] it'll speak to your heart. It'll deliver
[28:28] to you whatever you have need. It'll
[28:30] give you the answers. It'll give you
[28:31] revelation because you know what? We're
[28:33] here this morning to sit in heavenly
[28:35] places. And I that's what I'm here for
[28:37] this morning because I believe we've
[28:38] gathered. He said, "Whether two or three
[28:40] are gathered in my name, that's right."
[28:42] He said, "I'm there in the midst." Amen.
[28:44] And he's come to work this morning. He's
[28:46] come to minister and do what we've asked
[28:48] for him. Well, this morning is for us to
[28:52] be prepared this morning to receive what
[28:54] God has for us. Whatever you have need
[28:56] of, he's here this morning. I want I
[28:58] want to have my fields plowed. I want
[29:00] all the rocks and the brother talked
[29:03] about all the stink weed and everything
[29:04] else that's in the field. He get all
[29:06] that stuff racks, everything that. And I
[29:09] just want fertile ground this morning. I
[29:10] want I want it fertilized. I want
[29:12] prepared. I want to receive that good
[29:13] seed that goes forth this morning and
[29:15] have a good place where it lands where
[29:17] it'll go six 100 60 or 30fold. Amen. God
[29:23] bless you this morning.
[29:27] [Applause]
