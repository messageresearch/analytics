========================================

you know most the time people the you know they won't speak up well they got all this senority stuff going on in the message and I've got I've been in the message long than you have I know more than you do you know what Peter was in the message a lot longer than Paul was yeah Paul comes up one day and Peter says Paul says things hard to be understood Peter was walking with the man Paul never saw the man but there was a level of understanding that Paul had come to and you know what nobody taught Paul the Holy Ghost he took the scroll the Old Testament what we just read in Proverbs and all that he took that Old Testament and he brought 80% of the New Testament in writing to us so so there are levels of understanding that we have to come to so now we're recording so let's go to statute of perfect man and uh thank the Lord for the reading of the word this morning amen they're in the Book of Proverbs so now to the statute of a perfect man we're going to read some quotes this morning I want to try to read them all make comments cuz I've never got finished with all my quotes so but you see brother Bob made it like this so we can read it like a book we can go through Page by Page all right so can you read can you see that yes okay sister Anna yes I okay zel perfect man 1962 I know you can't see on the video but U but you can uh you can listen this is paragraph 59 now these people are Peter is saying here how that we must be takers partakers of his divine nature now each one of us are trying to grow into the stature of God that's our that's our goal that's our promise and like we've said many times before that's our requirement and I'm spending a lot of time on the foundation because if you don't get the found Foundation right why build a building right now after we get through with the Seven Seals then at that time of the sounding of the seventh seal are the loosening of course we know what a seal is is to loose the ministry to loose Seven Seals and we'll see that right on the chart is loosing a message something that's sealed up all right let's go to same we statue of perfect man paragraph 61 last Sunday night I preached on the key and the key is faith faith holds the key key and the key is the scripture but where do we get our faith if faith is the key where do we get our faith like sister Anna Canard says she's been reading more and it's become more inspired to her the words become more well brother BR said if you want to get closer to God read your Bible and study if you're not hearing anything from God you're not studying or reading enough that's right too simple and the key is Faith the the faith holds the key the key is the scripture and Christ is the door so Faith takes the little hinges of the scripture and unlocks the glories and good of God out to his people see so it's Faith holds the key that unlocks Christ to the people unlocks it reveals it so today we're going to take that same key to unlock the way to become a virtuous Christian in the stature of God that that and be a living Tabernacle for the Living God to dwell in paragraph 63 keep reading remember God reveals himself in three ways first time he revealed himself in a pillar of fire it was called the fatherhood that was in the Old Testament all right then that same God made manifest in Jesus Christ which he built a body made this body thirdly through the death of that body he Sanctified a church that he can dwell in it was God above us God With Us God in us the same God all right paragraph 74 through that blood we are cleansed and now our blood blood our life which came by living through sexual desire brought our life into the world the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us changes our Nature by sending upon us the Holy Spirit then we become in the divine nature of God everybody got that then we become a dwelling place for God Jesus said at that day you'll know that I am in the father and the father in me I in you and you in me paragraph 87 now I want to say this that there are some people who have a portion of this virtue knowledge wisdom patience and so forth that don't even profess to be Christians now we just were teaching Sunday school and that's true there are some people have a portion of this that don't even pretend to be Christian but that doesn't that won't do it it's like a black bird trying to put peacock feathers in his wings to make him a peacock he only disgraces himself be better to stay a blackbird see when he tries to exercise these things without being a Christian he just simply out of place well now paragraph 94 well now that's the way it is trying to manufacture that's what we don't want to do we don't want to try to manufacture these these virtues that's right okay no let's don't try to manufacture them what we're going to do is we're going to start in the faith maybe next Sunday after we get through this and and give some examples cuz see you should be born again that's the faith all right then we're going to give some examples of virtue well now that's the way it is trying to manufacture Christianity you can't do it the first thing you got to do is be born again you've got to be changed and when you're changed you become a new creation and now you're getting right now see now you don't have to worry about the feathers it'll take care of itself in other words you're a blackbird when God kills that old man burns that old nature out you don't have the nature of the black Bird anymore you got the nature of peacock well guess what if you were to film this thing you'd see a black bird but he would morph or in morphe God imorph into man you would imorph into a peacock and you would start pushing out you see the black bird feathers fall off and the peacock feathers start coming out cuz that's the nature that's in the bird now it wasn't before but it is now all right now you're getting right now now you don't have to worry about the feathers it'll take care of itself when you're born again yes sir notice paragraph 102 you must be born again look how many times he says You must be born again you got to have that nature change when you're born again you can't be born again without having faith so see on my chart here I got the very Foundation faith is the foundation of all of it for without faith it is impossible to please God so you can't please God with these virtues if you don't have faith right and we're talking baby form faith we're talking about the faith that was delivered to the Saints we're talking about faith just starting in your journey all right and that's what gets me about people 30 years into the journey and they're still on hair and dress and clothes and can't take the people any further where you been I mean you're you're either a black bird sticking peacock feathers in you all this time are you so the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is not you are right you the Holy Ghost so much right that's right because you can you can grieve the Holy Spirit like we read Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the Holy Spirit which you can you can grieve him he'll go out here and he'll just let you sit here and Ro and still be a Son of God Adam was a Son of God right he was a fallen Son of God he did a horrible thing but he was still a Son of God okay right and he didn't move any further because of what he did right he was God of the earth and then he lost that godship when he went with Eve and sold she didn't sell us out he sold us out that's right a Son of God that could speak the word and it would happen Son of God that could speak the word and it would happen he fell he fell in flesh see that's why we can fall in flesh that's why we can say no I don't want to open that door God I don't want you in there and he'll say okay my brother R said the Holy Ghost is very timid he's a gentleman he's not going to force his way in a door right you let him in and he'll do what he's supposed to do but if you don't let him in he'll say okay I'm not going to force my way into that door if you don't Pride whatever you want to say you you know put them all together but watch this you can't be boarding in without having faith that's right so you see them my chart here I got the very Foundation faith is the foundation of all of it for without faith is impossible to please God CU remember when you're born again he is pleased to dwell just like we were preaching the other day about Jesus on the River Jordan you on your River Jordan right you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost God says I am pleased to dwell in that vessel there's something about you that God likes okay he accepts you that Brother D has been preaching he accepts you and says this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell but he stops right there then you got to walk that you got to walk right faith is the foundation of all of it for without faith is impossible to please God so God can't say he's pleased with you if you don't have the new birth that's right right okay he that cometh to God must believe that he is what that he's God you got to believe that he's God and that he will do for you it's hard to explain and I'm I'm trying to find that quote where brother Brown says somehow God comes down through all that flesh Spirit goes in there and burns that old man out and puts himself in there and the prophet didn't know how to explain it he said there's some way that God does that and it is unexplainable it really is but you know what faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things you can't see there's a day when that absolute Pillar of Fire came down through like brother Brown said come through all that junk and gave you the new birth now you didn't see that right you saw the manifestation of it but that's exactly what happened like on the day of Pentecost when those clothing tongue of fire sit on their head that's what happened to you at the new birth or they got it different than you did but when you receive the new birth that's exactly what happen God comes in Satan goes out and you you don't open nothing in your body it's not something to whole that's got to go through right God works on your desire that's right where does the desire come from your spirit real Satan Soul it comes from it comes from you brother Brown said you hear from you heard from your theophany or I like to say you heard like I said my little quote that I got that you responded to the part of the word that God knew you'd respond to he had it in the Bible before the foundation of the world and when that responded to you or when you responded to it right when you responded to the word there's the connection there's the Searing out of Satan s e a r like you sear something on a grill the Searing out of Satan and the putting in of God right all right so there you have representation of predestination we got a discussion of this yesterday uh and that doesn't make you always was eternal but that part of you always was was eternal it's kind of hard to explain but I can explain it to y'all but into an unlearned crowd you can't really explain it because it is a representation there is a place in this word that you are going to come to if not God didn't know what he's doing cuz you were predestinated for the foundation of the world Jesus come to show you that you had an inheritance not give you one he he come to show you you had one and to be the door of the way back in cuz remember if you're to be redeemed it means you were here you went to here and now you're going back to here not over here you're going right back to here Redemption is not replacement Redemption is not dropping this and picking up this redemption's not even dropping this and it was right here and it fell and I lay it over there that's not Redemption Redemption is putting it back in its position and our rightful position got sold out by Adam in through adultery that he committed adultery and he accepted that God accepted our adultery cuz we committed adultery remember we were born to Satan and he was he was our husband it's not the old man don't have to die then that's what I was talking to the brother you can't you've only got faith or doubt in your soul either God's there or the devil's there one of the two there's not both of them there at the same time that's right right so in your soul you were not Eternal but there was an eternal part everybody understand what I'm saying listen to me there was an eternal part of you that was hidden in this word right because remember it's a thought God had the thought then it had to be spoken by somebody in the Bible then it had to be spoken by a preacher while you were standing here alive cuz remember brother R says it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally go from God but the seed or word everybody talking about the seed seed seed simply the seed is a word there is no germ see we go back to the sperm and eggs and all this stuff and we get all wrapped up into this human stuff remember none of that was supposed to be let's just be honest there was to be no sex there was to be no male sperm meeting female sperm that's the original that's right that's the original it was supposed to be spoken and then Eve would surely have something to do with it but it was spoken word not a sensation not a not an arousal come on let's be honest here but remember that's what we fell to cuz Adam accepted what Eve thought she was doing right so to be spoken word children we got to come back to not a seed male female germ sperm no the seed is the word of God that's what the Bible says so the seed's laying in here not in here but God knew one day though that the seed that was laying in here was going to go in here in other words brother brand he wouldn't have said um that God somehow come down through all that but see brother brandom in his Revelation he comes up to a higher point of Revelation he said you wasn't born on any certain day sons of God were always sons of God and he starts talking about that well that's right if that eternal life that you have come from God which it did had to that was eternal God did write your name in a book and you know what God did have something with you getting here God did have something with you getting here it was your mom and daddy that committed the app but look at all the germs and sperms and all that they had to go through to get you here MH millions and billions back from your great great great great great great great grandfather so it is predestinated that's right but you can't in a small in a group that's just coming up in the Lord you can't just say you always was eternal you never was born any a certain day you got this seed laying in you because people would just relax and go well I always had it I'm always this I'm always that I'm I'm in the message no you can't take salvation out of this brother brand there's no way he could take the blood of Jesus Christ dying on the cross out of his message but we do have to come to a realization that the real you didn't do it cuz if the real you did it you're still lost right if the real you did it cuz remember that Genesis 1 126 and 27 never cursed Never Smoke never committed adultery never had one mark of sin if it has one mark of sin then it's not part of that Genesis 12627 but you were a part of that and to me the Genesis 126 and 27 is the word right cuz it's a word body that we're looking at not a body that Mom and Daddy brought but because of the Fall to go back to Redemption to go back to Redemption you got to go back through the blood of Jesus Christ right if not if we didn't need the blood of Jesus Christ he could have just said Nicodemus me and you were always Eternal no he said Nicodemus you should need something new because what you got is old simple is that you read my mind remember the oh God the that's corre the word of God that's right and that's what's Eternal and that portion sure of God's word that pertains to me for my age that's what strikes in me and that's what was eternal I mean listen listen everybody did did you not react one day you reacted to somebody preaching the word of God not reading the newspaper not reading a good story somewhere not reading about this one or that you were convicted by what a man was preaching from the word of God there's the seed now you can say it laid dormant in you you can say whatever you want to it laid dormant in your understanding cuz the word's not dormant right but now you see brother around he say the word laid dormant it was dead it laid in the Tomb well that was the word of God laying there that's right right but when the life come to it it quickened that life and brought it back to life same way with you and I it quickened the word that you held can ever be born again without listening to the word first right and the life has to come through the body now why in the world would brother R say the seed life hasn't come through the body if you already had the seed I about to ask you CE Simplicity well they're trying to make this and and look I'll tell there when it's not the thing's not on but there is a truth to that if you'll really understand you were always Eternal you are always in the mind of God you always were going to be a Son of God if not God had a new thought right but you got to realize you were lost first right then you got to realize you got to get these virtues working in your life that's right when brother randam got a revelation of the seals did it reveal to him that the real you didn't do it and it's not that you come to a place where the real you didn't do it no the real you never done it but remember this you is the one you got to deal with first if you deal with this you first the one that Mom and Daddy brought that brought all the memory reason conscious faction imagination and all these things if you deal with that first then you can see that God did predestinate you and you did have a part in the word and you were always a Son of God can is that okay I me but but you were lost the Bible say you were lost Paul say such were some of you children of Wrath he said that's right he didn't say you were set over here aside but in God's mind you were set over here aside there is a separation CU that Genesis 126 and 27 is only the people that receive the new birth in this world that is not the Old Testament saints that is not um Nicodemus that is not the foolish virgin that is not the 144,000 that is the people that God knew would want to be his children more than any person on the face of the Earth amen exactly I was thinking the Jews are part of God's family true but he married a gentile you don't marry within your family even today you pick somebody outside that's right that's good but remember too Abraham was never called a Son of God Abraham was called a friend of God that's right now he'll be given eternal life right he'll be given eternal life because of what was covered under the blood of bulls and goats God honored that but now Abraham sure he's going to have a place in the city because he's the father of our faith but he's not going to have a place in the city to live I don't believe that only the people that live in there are going to be the bride and the 144,000 now they may be see because the Bible says that that the foundation of the Apostles well they're not going to be Abraham's not going to be on one corner of the of the of the city that's carinal but he's not going to be in one corner of the city holding this holding it up no it's what it's the foundation of their faith right it's the foundation of what they brought I'm preaching we're not in Sunday school so hey let's get back to that when you're a skeptic of the Bible when you're skeptic of the word being right you just might as well stay back until first you believe it hold back what is sin unbelief there's only two elements that control the human being right here it is there only two elements that control the human being that's either doubt or faith and before you were a doubter right right so was God in there no but God was in here and you were in here right you were here right this is the seed this is where we should have been born from preaching again all right one of the other you're possessed of one that dominates your life now tell me when you were out in the world of sin there was not a part of God in you anywhere right there was a representation that you was going to come to it but when you did what you did the Bible say I told the brother I said said I got one scripture that says God will not dwell in an unclean vessel so where is that seed when I'm out there in a bed of adultery or out there committing a crime or out there cursing the name of God right where is God in any of that now God had it laying waiting waiting on you to come to a place then brother Brown said somehow God comes down through all that and give you a new birth now to me that I agree that that always was eternal God knew you'd always you'd be that he knew the day you'd come to it but you didn't right you're possess of one that dominates your life just depends on how much Faith you have is how high you can rise that's right all right and now Faith does the rest of it Faith does the rest so you got to have faith first to get virtue all right all Christianity all you are all you'll ever be is based on faith in the word that's the reason I believe the word all right all right then he says first you must be born again then when you're born again you have faith you believe the word until you're born again you'll argue against it if you're just religiously inclined you got a little human knowledge that you should do right you'll never be able to agree on the word of God you'll never do it got to be born again and born again it produces Faith all right then after you get Faith that's right here f a i he's got it on the pyramid then you're just in position of growing now there's where the thing comes in this morning we're going to talk about now talking about a house Foundation what is the foundation of Christianity faith in the word of God not faith in a man faith in the word of God all right that's your foundation then you begin to grow then you start you begin to add to this Foundation all right now here's what we do what's the first thing have faith and be born again that's laying the foundation then after we lay the foundation secondly you add to your foundation add to your faith first you have faith then you add virtue to your faith that's the next column first pour your foundation then to your faith add virtue now right there knocks a lot of us down yes sir add virtue to your faith that doesn't just mean Liv in a Virg in life you know like the woman or a man and so forth that doesn't have nothing to do with it all right so we see that that's it yeah that's the last one okay but you got to have faith now right there knocks a lot of us off so add to your faith virtue so you got have you got to have faith to believe that God's going to give you virtue you don't have faith that God's going to give you virtue then you need to stop right there pack it in a little bit more you know what take a little bit the foundation may be a little wobbly but it's a foundation but you got to go over there and pack that corner or pack that side over there and get it real firm that you're part of God you're his you're his child and once being child and being in the family you can have all these other attributes all right called virtue knowledge Temperance patience so think on faith and we'll read some about faith next Sunday all right but add to your faith add to what you believe virtue bless you bud thank you
