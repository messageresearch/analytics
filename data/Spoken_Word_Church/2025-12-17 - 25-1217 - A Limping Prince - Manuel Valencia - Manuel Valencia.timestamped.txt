[18:38] Oh tell me.
[18:51] Praise the Lord. God bless you all.
[18:53] Thank you. Thank you so much, brothers.
[18:55] If you have your Bibles, you can go to
[18:56] Genesis 32. Praise the Lord. We'll be in
[19:00] uh verses 24 and 25 to start off with.
[19:04] Thank you, brother. God bless you all
[19:06] musicians.
[19:10] My what an atmosphere, brothers. Thank
[19:12] you so much for coming in and bringing
[19:14] your liquor fire and helping create an
[19:17] atmosphere for God's word to be
[19:19] imparting at us. Amen. Today title we
[19:22] have a a limping prince. A limping
[19:25] prince. And in Genesis
[19:29] Genesis um 32 24 and 25. And we have a
[19:34] subtitle wrestling with the angel of the
[19:36] Lord.
[19:38] Amen. So here's Genesis 32.
[19:41] Let me go back to
[19:46] my scripture. Here's
[19:52] a minute here. Let me pull that up from
[19:54] here.
[19:59] All right. So, in Genesis 32, we have,
[20:02] "And Jacob was left alone,
[20:06] and there wrestled a man with him
[20:10] until the breaking of the day."
[20:14] And when he saw the angel that he
[20:17] prevailed not against him Jacob, he
[20:21] touched the hollow of his thigh.
[20:25] And the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out
[20:28] of joint
[20:30] as he wrestled with him. Amen. You may
[20:33] uh have your seats. Heavenly Father, we
[20:35] ask that you bless this service, that
[20:37] you would continue to bless the word
[20:38] that would unfold to us. I pray so much,
[20:40] Father, that these special uh words of
[20:43] life will will bring uh exactly what you
[20:47] call them out to bring, Father, to bring
[20:48] forth life. We thank you for it. And I
[20:50] just ask, Father, that our eyes will be
[20:53] clearly open and our ears clearly uh
[20:56] father receive the the distinct message
[20:59] that you have for us in this age. I pray
[21:01] in the precious and the mighty name of
[21:03] our Lord and our Savior Jesus Christ.
[21:06] Amen. So going back to Genesis 32 and:es
[21:09] 22- 23 we have here this is Jacob now
[21:14] and he rose up that night
[21:18] and took his two wives and his two woman
[21:22] servants. Now note this and his 11 sons.
[21:27] So ask yourselves who was there? If I do
[21:30] my math right I believe there was a
[21:33] Joseph there. If you look back in
[21:35] Genesis 30, we find out that Joseph was
[21:37] born. Joseph was already born at this
[21:39] time. So, think about it. Put that into
[21:42] perspective.
[21:45] The lineage was already there,
[21:48] but there still had to be a a wrestle
[21:51] that had to happen before
[21:54] um he wrestled. Joseph was already on
[21:56] the scene, not through Esau. Isn't that
[22:00] amazing? and passed over the Fort
[22:03] Habock, which is an area around Jordan
[22:06] as I studied it. And he took them and
[22:09] sent them over the brook. We'll find out
[22:11] that it's Jordan, and sent them over
[22:13] that sent and sent over that he had.
[22:17] We'll find out later that he sent over
[22:19] all that he had with them.
[22:21] And Jacob was left, excuse me, this is
[22:23] that verse went in there. And yeah, and
[22:27] Jacob was left alone. So that was the
[22:29] prefix of what happened. And there
[22:33] in that position when we're all by
[22:35] ourselves when uh we'll find out what
[22:36] had happened before
[22:41] there wrestled the man. Notice how it
[22:43] starts that the man wrestled with Jacob
[22:45] first with him until the breaking of the
[22:49] day. And when he saw that he prevailed
[22:52] not against him, against Jacob, he
[22:54] touched the hollow of his thigh,
[22:57] and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out
[22:59] of joint as he wrestled with him.
[23:03] Notice this. And he said, Let me go, for
[23:06] the day breakth. And he said, I will not
[23:09] let thee go except thou bless me.
[23:14] And he sent unto him and excuse me, he
[23:17] said unto him, What is thy name? The
[23:19] angel asked him, "What is thy name?" And
[23:22] he said, "Deceiver,
[23:24] Jacob." His old identity, right? Sir
[23:27] Planter.
[23:29] Jacob is my name.
[23:32] So notice this is a fight about a name.
[23:35] This is a fight about a blessing. This
[23:37] is a fight about a birthwight,
[23:39] birthright.
[23:41] And notice what the meaning here is be
[23:44] about names. What is thy name? And he
[23:46] said, "Jacob." And he said, "Thy name,"
[23:49] he couldn't find that name in the book.
[23:52] He said, "Thy name shall be called no
[23:54] more Jacob,
[23:57] but Israel.
[23:59] For as a prince has thou power
[24:03] with God and with man,
[24:08] and has prevailed," past tense, a man,
[24:11] all that came with Israel.
[24:15] And Jacob asked him and said, "Tell me,
[24:19] I pray thee, thy name. Reveal to me thy
[24:25] name,
[24:26] oh angel of the Lord. Wherefore is it
[24:29] that thou dost ask after my name?"
[24:34] And there's silence. There's quiet. It's
[24:36] a personal revelation to to you
[24:38] personally of Jesus Christ.
[24:42] and he blessed him there under that
[24:45] situation, under that circumstance,
[24:46] under that visitation, under that night,
[24:48] under that break of day. Amen. All these
[24:51] things have a symbol, brother. And this
[24:53] is what we're going to hone in. So, have
[24:55] your Bibles there on Genesis 32. We
[24:58] won't be jumping all over the place. It
[24:59] will be talking about what happened
[25:02] before that, what happened after that,
[25:06] and all that it means.
[25:09] I remember the first time I read this
[25:11] concept of a man wrestling.
[25:14] And now here it starts by saying a man
[25:17] wrestled with the Jacob and then we find
[25:20] out later that it it was more than a
[25:21] man, right?
[25:24] And in verse 30 and Jacob called the
[25:28] name of the place Pineel,
[25:31] he had a name change. This is all about
[25:32] names here. For I have seen God face to
[25:36] face and my life is preserved.
[25:40] Th this is something really significant
[25:42] that happened to Jacob.
[25:46] And as he passed over Penuel, different
[25:49] pronunciation there know that the sun
[25:51] rose
[25:53] the s rises over you upon him
[26:00] and he halted upon his thigh.
[26:03] started um
[26:06] walking different. Therefore, the
[26:09] children of Israel eat not the senu
[26:12] which shrank which is upon the hollow of
[26:15] the thigh
[26:17] unto this day because he the angel
[26:21] touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh
[26:25] in the s in the senu that shrank.
[26:29] So not note this.
[26:32] Jacob deceived Esau.
[26:35] Then look at the progression. Then we
[26:36] have he is then deceived by Laban his
[26:40] father-in-law 10 times. He's changed his
[26:42] wages. He had to work seven years for
[26:45] one. Gave him the wrong one. He worked
[26:48] another seven years. Work another six
[26:50] years for his cattle. So 20 years 20
[26:54] years he he
[26:57] took 20 years to be deceived himself so
[27:01] that he can uh think on his ways.
[27:05] Then he flees from deceit. He turns away
[27:09] from deceit from Laban. Now Laban comes
[27:12] after him and they make a deal. They
[27:15] they raise a a place and they say okay
[27:17] you stay over here. I stay over here.
[27:21] Then something interesting happened is
[27:23] Esau, excuse me, Jacob, he calls on on
[27:26] God. And we'll see it here in in the
[27:28] scriptures. He repents from deceiving
[27:31] Esau. So then he seeks forgiveness
[27:35] for for deceiving.
[27:37] He he asks for forgiveness.
[27:39] And um notice here uh going this is
[27:41] going back to the same chapter in verse
[27:43] six.
[27:45] And the messengers that Jacob had sent
[27:48] out returned to Jacob, saying, "We came
[27:50] to thy brother Esau." You know what it
[27:53] represents. And he also cometh to meet
[27:56] thee. Your past is after you, your your
[27:59] sin, your deceit, the effects of the
[28:02] deceit, and whom you deceit come after
[28:04] thee. And 400 men with him.
[28:08] His path was attacking him. He his whole
[28:12] life was before him.
[28:14] his name. That's who he was. So then
[28:19] Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed.
[28:26] And I believe that's the position that
[28:28] that we have to go through to be able to
[28:32] not want our life anymore. And he
[28:34] divided the people that was with him. So
[28:38] his people he look at this what
[28:39] happened. and the flocks and the herds
[28:41] and the camels into two bands.
[28:47] Look at all that is going on behind the
[28:49] scenes. So, and and said verse eight,
[28:53] and said if Esau, this is him, right? If
[28:55] Esau come to me the one company and
[28:59] smite it, then the other company which
[29:01] is left shall escape. So, this was
[29:03] serious business. This is not just like
[29:05] I'm having a little trouble, you know,
[29:06] here here and there. This is his life's
[29:10] struggle. This is his past coming to
[29:13] haunt him.
[29:14] So then and Jacob in verse 9 said, "Oh
[29:18] God of my father Abraham and God of my
[29:24] father Isaac,
[29:26] the Lord which saith unto me," he
[29:29] started meditating on his ways, "Return
[29:35] unto thy country and to thy kindred, and
[29:38] I will deal with well with thee.
[29:42] I am not worthy." See, he's still
[29:43] talking to him, right? He's still
[29:44] calling on God. I am not worthy of the
[29:46] least of all thy mercies
[29:49] and of all the truth.
[29:52] No longer deceit,
[29:55] which thou hast showed me assured unto
[29:59] thy servant. For with my staff I passed
[30:03] over this Jordan. Isn't that an
[30:06] interesting illustration there? And now
[30:08] I am become become two bands.
[30:13] But look what he prays. Deliver me I
[30:16] pray thee from the hand of my
[30:20] path, my brother, my my old nature, from
[30:24] the hand of Esau. For I fear him lest he
[30:29] will come and smite me and my and the
[30:33] mother of with the children.
[30:36] So notice the background here of what
[30:37] had happened before
[30:40] he goes in into that night.
[30:43] As I thought of my ways, brother Bandom
[30:44] says, "There might be many in here
[30:47] tonight is thinking about going home.
[30:51] Old age is catching up with you.
[30:53] Sickness has caught you in a grip.
[30:57] Better think on your ways before you get
[30:59] there." And as Jacob on his way on his
[31:04] way with his wife and his children and
[31:08] heard, excuse me, and heard
[31:12] he heard a message coming that Esau with
[31:16] a great army. There was 400 men was
[31:20] coming to meet him and he began to think
[31:22] on his ways the way he had done Esau.
[31:27] cheated him and it drove him to prayer
[31:32] all night long. He wrestled with that
[31:34] angel of the Lord. And I trust tonight
[31:37] that man and woman, boys and girls,
[31:42] boys and girls who has neglected the
[31:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost. So see what
[31:46] we're after here.
[31:49] You don't know how near you are to home.
[31:52] I trust you'll put purpose in your heart
[31:56] that you will wrestle with the angel of
[31:58] the Lord and not let go until you're
[32:02] blessed, until it happens, until what
[32:06] Jacob needed, what we need happens. And
[32:08] it's relating here to not neglecting the
[32:10] baptism of the Holy Ghost. Amen. So keep
[32:13] that in mind. So talk about a name
[32:15] change here just briefly. So in
[32:17] Revelations uh 21:17
[32:20] uh we have uh we'll come back to this
[32:22] here in a minute. So we have Adam,
[32:23] right? He called his name Eve because it
[32:26] was the woman, the woman, the woman. But
[32:28] he calls his name Eve because she was
[32:29] the mother of all living. Just what
[32:31] comes along with names. We see Abraham
[32:33] in the Old Testament, Abraham being
[32:35] Abraham, Sarai being Sarah, Jacob being
[32:38] Israel, prince with God. Just a few
[32:41] examples. In the New Testament, we see
[32:43] Saul, Paul, Simon becoming, you know, a
[32:47] rock, Peter or Sephus. But look at this
[32:50] in Revelations 21:17. White stone with a
[32:54] new name in it given to the overcomer.
[32:57] And now it reads says, "He that hath an
[33:00] ear, let him hear what the spirit saith
[33:02] unto the churches. To him that
[33:04] overcomemeth will I give
[33:07] to eat of the hidden mana and will give
[33:11] him a white stone of revelation. Right?
[33:14] And in that stone a new name
[33:18] written which no man knoweth except or
[33:22] saving he that receiveth it. It's a
[33:25] personal revelation of Jesus Christ to
[33:27] you to me personally. Amen.
[33:30] So the birthright I I had a question
[33:32] about the birth right and this is was
[33:35] just burning on my heart and I said so
[33:38] when did it happen?
[33:41] We know what happened with Esau and and
[33:43] and the red pes and the lentils and and
[33:46] so forth when when the transaction
[33:49] happened. But is that really when he
[33:52] received it?
[33:55] In other words, I have a question for
[33:56] you. Did Jacob receive the birthright by
[33:58] deceit?
[34:02] which is uh that's that's the flesh,
[34:04] right? That's a fruit of the flesh. So,
[34:06] I was really meditating on that. It was
[34:08] just really pondering about it because,
[34:10] you know, we know that they sold the
[34:12] they did the transaction. They did a
[34:13] deal. It's like, "Oh, you're about to
[34:15] die. So, what do you need it for?" You
[34:16] know, I got some red pottage and here we
[34:19] go. Did he really
[34:22] Did he Was he really changed then? Or
[34:24] did it You see the question there?
[34:27] Something did happen. He he went after
[34:28] it. It showed a desire that he had in
[34:30] his heart since he was a baby, right? He
[34:32] was after the heal.
[34:35] And it's we got to be careful not to uh
[34:38] look for good things in the wrong way,
[34:39] in the wrong approach. It's good to be
[34:42] blessed. It's good to be a saved, be
[34:45] walking sanctification, receive the
[34:47] baptism of Holy Ghost, but it's got to
[34:49] come God's provided way. Or did the
[34:52] birthright come by repenting, believing,
[34:56] wrestling, receiving a new name,
[34:58] receiving the consequence in himself,
[35:02] the touch, you know, um the
[35:06] the consequence that now is affecting
[35:08] his life forever. How he walks, thinks
[35:11] and goes about
[35:15] the the real change, right? that night,
[35:17] that breaking of the day.
[35:23] In Genesis 25, we see, "And Esau said to
[35:26] Jacob, feed me, I pray thee, with that
[35:30] same bread pottage, for I am faint."
[35:33] Now, he had a name changed, too.
[35:35] Therefore, was his name called Edom.
[35:38] Faint is pretty near like a death word.
[35:41] You'll find out that he himself said it.
[35:43] And Jacob said, "Sell me this day thy
[35:46] birthright."
[35:47] And Esau said, "Behold, I am at the
[35:50] point to die."
[35:53] And what did um and it says, "And what
[35:56] profit shall this birthright do to me?"
[36:00] So he said, "I'm Edom. I'm about to die.
[36:03] I'm faint." Apparently, every time they
[36:04] say a name, they usually when they say
[36:06] because of this, there therefore was his
[36:08] name called Edom because he said, "I'm
[36:10] I'm faint." It describes the name. Now
[36:14] notice here there's three events really
[36:17] I just came to it just came to me
[36:20] actually the one I was missing because
[36:23] because I I knew that um the wrestling
[36:25] had a lot more to do with this blessing.
[36:28] Right. But in here
[36:32] in here
[36:34] it's not a whole lot of deceit that
[36:36] happened here. He's basically one's
[36:38] despising it the other one's just taking
[36:40] advantage of it. But of course when the
[36:41] deceit happened was when the mother got
[36:45] together and he wanted to get the
[36:47] blessing from the father in the in the
[36:50] carnal way. Now that was the seed right
[36:53] there. So see the order of events here.
[36:58] And Jacob says sell me this day thy
[37:01] birthright. And Esau said behold I am at
[37:03] the point of to die. I'm Edom, right?
[37:06] I'm faint. And what what prophet shall
[37:09] this birthight birthright do to me? See,
[37:11] no faith, no hope, no aspiration. That's
[37:14] when Abraham, he had hope against hope.
[37:17] I've been there before. I remember um I
[37:20] remember being to the point where I was
[37:22] physically dying, but I was building a
[37:25] house.
[37:27] I was building for the future. I was I
[37:30] was studying for whenever the Lord will
[37:32] help me teach.
[37:34] But I was dying.
[37:36] See, you had to have that. You had to
[37:38] have that little pilot light burning in
[37:40] you at least if you don't have the full
[37:41] fire going on.
[37:43] And and Jacob said that. And then in 33,
[37:47] and Jacob said, "Swear to me this day."
[37:49] And he swear unto him. And he sold his
[37:52] birthright unto Jacob. Then Jacob gave
[37:55] Esau bread and pottage of lentils, and
[37:58] he did eat and drank, and he rose up,
[38:01] and he went his way. He went his own
[38:04] way. Thus, Esau despised
[38:07] his birthright.
[38:11] So, you know, what we find here when
[38:13] when uh
[38:17] when Jacob wrestled with uh the angel of
[38:20] the Lord, so after the blessing came
[38:23] that courage, that purpose. Look at the
[38:26] the definition that he was given for his
[38:27] name. He said because as a prince, you
[38:29] have power with God and man. and had
[38:33] have not noticed that in man. So when
[38:37] when he he basically became someone who
[38:39] was a prince as a prince that who has
[38:42] power with God and man. So he was
[38:46] empowered he he received the power the
[38:49] dunamis right to face your past with
[38:51] divine resolution. It's a thought that
[38:54] came to me that it wasn't when he sold
[38:57] it and it wasn't when he asked the
[38:58] father to bless him, you know, in a
[39:00] deceitful way. He really still had to
[39:03] pay the consequences of that deceit for
[39:06] 20 years. I I wrote it in the Bible. I
[39:09] think it's a verse the chapter before 31
[39:11] of Genesis. It describes how that went
[39:13] on went on that um he he numbered them.
[39:18] He said 20 years. He said seven plus
[39:20] another seven plus six and and then
[39:23] there was still no letting go and he saw
[39:25] that Laban's uh Laban was coming after
[39:28] him even even more he said that his um
[39:31] his countenance was not the same as it
[39:33] had been before and then here is Esau
[39:35] coming after him all adding up to him
[39:38] all catching up to him. So, Jacob going
[39:41] from a deceiver,
[39:44] sllerter, just carnal, right, to being a
[39:48] prince with God. But it didn't come
[39:51] easy. We're going to walk through this.
[39:52] It didn't come easy. It it it it left a
[39:55] scar on him. It left a mark on him. And
[39:57] we all can identify with that.
[40:01] I remember thinking how
[40:03] supernatural it seems for a man to
[40:05] wrestle with the angel of the Lord. And
[40:08] in the scriptures we found later we find
[40:10] what he says that um that he he when he
[40:14] says give me a minute
[40:22] when he said for I have seen God for I
[40:24] have seen God. So it went saying a man
[40:26] and then for I have seen God and I know
[40:28] brother Random and all the message
[40:29] quotes he he calls it out the angel of
[40:32] the Lord. the angel of the Lord. And
[40:35] here my redeemth leave liveth. He says,
[40:38] "And when and then when Isaac begot
[40:41] Jacob and Jacob died way down in Egypt,
[40:44] way away from his land. He was a
[40:47] crippled man. He walked different what
[40:50] he used to walk because one night now
[40:54] we're going to read about that one night
[40:55] a lot. He come in contact with the angel
[40:58] of God and the Lord touched his hip and
[41:01] made him walk different. He had an
[41:04] evidence. I have an evidence, brothers
[41:06] and sisters. I actually have because God
[41:09] does something and when he uh when he
[41:12] changes your name when he gives you the
[41:13] baptism of the Holy Ghost as we saw and
[41:16] that he had been a hold of God and God
[41:20] had been a hold of him and that's the
[41:23] way you really think about it they
[41:25] exchange names right they talk about
[41:27] Jacob no you're not Jacob you are Israel
[41:29] and let me tell you who I am
[41:33] when I was studying that that kind of
[41:34] opened up to me that he said and he
[41:36] blessed him there. Um when he says,
[41:38] "What's your name? I pray thee." And he
[41:41] just says, "And he blessed him there."
[41:44] He was asking for his name. What do you
[41:45] bless him with?
[41:47] And it says, "And he had an evidence."
[41:49] Uh and that's the way when he's got that
[41:53] evidence, that old hip that he
[41:57] walked on there making him walk
[41:59] straight. Isn't that a paradox?
[42:02] a old cripppid hip that walk on there in
[42:05] the natural but making him walk straight
[42:07] supernaturally
[42:09] with the things of the Lord is a paradox
[42:11] brothers and you know and and that's
[42:13] where it's fitting where brother Vanam
[42:14] said you know that the bride is u is the
[42:18] ones that battle the sick you know the
[42:20] sickness the most the sickest you know
[42:22] body in earth because in one way we're
[42:25] very healthy brothers but in another way
[42:27] you know we we struggle a lot right and
[42:29] that's we we battle a I should say with
[42:33] um with with the consequences, but
[42:35] that's what drove us to to have the
[42:37] courage to to wrestle and and and repent
[42:42] really from our old name and get the new
[42:44] name.
[42:46] That's how it happened. So one side a
[42:48] great boaster a great well what he was
[42:52] really called he was a deceiver.
[42:55] It was called a deceiver. The very word
[42:58] Jacob means deceiver. And when he was on
[43:02] this side, a deceiver. Look at this. A
[43:05] great healthy strong deceiver.
[43:09] How many can remember how, you know, I
[43:12] remember what it was like to be a great
[43:14] healthy strong, you know, sinner, a
[43:17] deceiver. And a lot of times I question
[43:20] myself, it's like, well, how come I was
[43:22] healthier back then? You know, in in in
[43:24] the natural, in the humanity.
[43:26] And it's humbling, brother. It's
[43:29] humbling because at least that's how it
[43:31] came to me is
[43:34] this birthright didn't come cheap to me.
[43:37] It come with a lot of suffering and on
[43:39] the other side a limping prince the
[43:42] title of the sermon that had been with
[43:45] God touched
[43:48] different
[43:49] had that blessing that blessed hope with
[43:52] him within him. He walked different he
[43:56] acted different. He lived different. Now
[43:59] that carnal believer today in this other
[44:01] message, oh, as long as I go to church
[44:04] and do what it's right, and what
[44:07] difference does it make? That's the Esau
[44:10] group. He still makes fun and despises
[44:12] the birthright.
[44:14] He doesn't care for it, but Jacob loved
[44:18] it. Loved it. Loved that birthright. And
[44:21] the spiritual man today, the spiritual
[44:23] woman
[44:25] that's elected, predestinated of God to
[44:27] come to eternal life, if they have to
[44:31] sell everything they got,
[44:34] that's your path, too. Don't you think
[44:36] moneywise? If they had to forsake
[44:39] everything, right? If they had to take
[44:40] their name, listen to this, off of every
[44:43] church book in the nation,
[44:47] they still want that birthright. Hey,
[44:49] I'll take my old name out of anywhere. I
[44:51] don't want my own name,
[44:54] my own deceiver name. It's the only
[44:56] thing that matters to them. Just get
[44:59] that birthright.
[45:01] Get that name change. Get that baptism
[45:03] of the Holy Ghost. That brother Random
[45:05] said, woman, man, boy, girl, do not
[45:09] neglect to receive the baptism of the
[45:11] Holy Ghost.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; He does. And then where we left off?
[45:18] Get the birthright. That's all.
[45:22] Hearing, recognizing, acting on the word
[45:23] of God, the title of the message.
[45:26] No matter how what level they have to
[45:30] come on, if they have to get down at the
[45:34] altar and cry, boohoo, if they have to
[45:37] run through the places and go back, now
[45:40] this one hurts. And go back and make
[45:43] things right. What did Jacob do?
[45:48] He had to go back and and make make
[45:50] things right.
[45:53] You know, after he got sick of being
[45:54] deceived for 20 years, he said, "You
[45:56] know what? This really does affect, you
[45:58] know, on the other end.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; I'm so sorry. I I think I think he had
[46:02] it for 20 years. Now, he said, you know,
[46:04] Esau, I'm sorry I deceived you."
[46:08] And he had to go make things right. And
[46:10] see, but this that group, the Jacob will
[46:13] do this. and sell what they got or give
[46:17] it away everything they have and become
[46:20] a pilgrim and a stranger. It doesn't
[46:23] matter. They want the birthight. That's
[46:27] all they're interested in, the
[46:28] birthight. Now, don't blame them people.
[46:31] They can't help it. They were
[46:33] predestinated to that, elected to it
[46:36] from night to day. So you know I
[46:39] remember actually one physical night
[46:42] when I actually had to do this where I
[46:45] had to work out my own salvation with
[46:47] fear and trembling. I had to make my own
[46:49] calling and election. Sure. I was saved.
[46:52] I had been going through the process of
[46:53] sanctification
[46:55] which is the work of the Holy Ghost too.
[46:59] But I do remember pleading the lower
[47:02] right for the birthright because faith
[47:05] comes by hearing. Hear the word of God.
[47:06] And I was hearing his open book, his
[47:09] message for this day. And it was calling
[47:12] me. It was drawing me as as a magnet. It
[47:14] was a deep calling to a deep
[47:17] &gt;&gt; and and you know, it's coming about you.
[47:19] It's coming to do. And and there's
[47:21] always a there's always uh extremes
[47:23] where people say, you know, you don't
[47:24] have to do anything. All you have to do
[47:26] is surrender. Or some people that say,
[47:27] you know, um you you got to do
[47:30] everything. That's also wrong. But what
[47:31] we we did see here, Jacob had activity
[47:33] going on. Jacob just didn't go and say,
[47:36] "Hey, hey, hey, look, let's go. Let's go
[47:39] duke it out or let's go have a fight
[47:40] with with the angel of the Lord and
[47:42] just, you know, let's go get a
[47:44] blessing." He already had tried it all
[47:46] different ways. So, he had to go through
[47:47] all these things that we saw when he had
[47:49] to go through BDC for 20 years and and
[47:52] all that. He had to have a journey
[47:55] to come to this place where where he was
[47:57] ready for it. But that one night I I
[48:00] remember it myself like physically
[48:02] literally praying through and breaking
[48:04] through all night and and and just not
[48:06] letting go into the break of day and
[48:09] asking the Lord asking the Lord for that
[48:12] blessing. But you know what that night
[48:14] represents too because it's not just one
[48:16] physical literal day too. It it just
[48:18] means your night. It means it means all
[48:22] that you have to go through those 20
[48:25] years
[48:27] and and and having to be I mean to the
[48:30] point where you had to like leave and
[48:31] flee. But look what he did. He fle I
[48:35] just realized that he fleed
[48:38] him being deceived
[48:41] but he went straight.
[48:44] He went straight to try to make things
[48:46] right in in his past.
[48:49] So you know that the Lord had been
[48:51] orchestrating all that and working
[48:52] through it. Just like Moses, you know,
[48:54] he had to have all those years to take
[48:56] Egypt out. In this case,
[48:58] Jacob had to have those 20 years to get,
[49:02] you know, his own name reflected in the
[49:05] mirror towards him
[49:08] from night to day. Jacob one night,
[49:12] brother Bam speaking in convinced then
[49:14] concerned you know he had left Laban and
[49:19] he had he was on his road over the
[49:22] desire
[49:25] come in his heart to visit his homeland
[49:28] and now we find out that he was afraid
[49:31] he wasn't uh he was afraid to meet his
[49:34] brother.
[49:36] So you see how it happened right quick
[49:38] and he me his brother. So he went down
[49:42] to business before he crossed Jordan and
[49:46] prayed all night and he wrestled with
[49:49] the Lord. Wrestled all night. Oh, he
[49:52] said I will not let you go like that.
[49:56] Hold on to him. Right. Stay all night
[50:00] with him. the 20 years plus whatever it
[50:04] took for him.
[50:06] Stay all night. It could be a literal
[50:08] night too where you have to or day where
[50:10] you have to just go on with the Lord and
[50:12] and make work out your own salvation
[50:14] with fear and trembling and go through
[50:16] what you got to make right and clean
[50:17] your path. And he wrestled with the Lord
[50:20] all night. And the angel said, "It's
[50:22] coming daylight. I must leave."
[50:25] He said, "I'll just not let you go. I
[50:29] want something in me
[50:32] that's different. Look at the desire.
[50:34] Look, he I didn't realize how much Jacob
[50:37] had changed after 20 years of of his own
[50:40] mirror in front of him. I want something
[50:43] in me that'll change me. In me that'll
[50:46] change me. What a picture. And you
[50:49] notice as soon as the Lord blessed him,
[50:53] the blessing that he asked for, he was
[50:56] ready then to cross the river and go see
[51:00] his brother. That's what I was saying is
[51:01] that once you go through this, now you
[51:04] can go face with a divine resolution.
[51:07] your past,
[51:10] &gt;&gt; your old life, your deceitful ways, your
[51:13] everything that I mean, sometimes we
[51:15] we're out there and been in sin so long
[51:17] that you you don't realize how how are
[51:19] you going to how is it all going to work
[51:21] out together for good. It's just too
[51:22] much. You've done too bad, too much for
[51:25] too long, 20 years.
[51:29] Jacob uh he said, "I want something in
[51:32] me that'll change me." And you notice as
[51:35] soon as the Lord blessed him. The
[51:36] blessing that he asked for, he was ready
[51:38] then to cross the river and go see his
[51:41] brother. See why? He wrestled all night.
[51:43] He stayed with He stayed with with God
[51:47] all night long and wrestled with God.
[51:50] Now if he just said, "Hey, leave me
[51:53] alone now. I'm tired." See, now Esau
[51:58] said, "I'm faint.
[52:00] I'm eat. Uh why would I need this? I'm
[52:03] about to die. Remember hope against
[52:05] hope. The blessing would have never
[52:08] come. See, he'd never never been there.
[52:11] See, but he stayed all night. See, he
[52:16] wrestled with him all night, then was
[52:20] ready to go meet his brother the next
[52:23] morning.
[52:25] What a what what a transformation,
[52:27] brother. What a conversion.
[52:30] Uh in Spanish, I like this verse. is
[52:32] Isaiah 8:20 it says to the law and to
[52:35] the testimony and they speak not
[52:37] according to this word
[52:40] it is because there's no light in them
[52:42] now that word no light in them means uh
[52:44] it's because the breaking of day has not
[52:46] dawn upon them you see this happened to
[52:49] Jacob this happened to many of you this
[52:52] happened to me where yeah it was night
[52:55] yeah it was for Jacob 20 years of being
[52:59] deceived so that he could finally come
[53:02] to the place of repentance and genuinely
[53:05] for the same thing. He was being
[53:07] deceived. It wasn't like uh somebody was
[53:10] out there battling or something. No, see
[53:12] how the Lord deals with us. Those things
[53:15] we did, we we got to see the fruits on
[53:17] from the other side.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; And that hurts, brother. I don't know
[53:20] about you, when the Lord deals with you
[53:23] precisely with what you need so that you
[53:25] you can come and be brought genuinely to
[53:27] a place of repentance. Then you don't
[53:29] need mama, daddy, uncle,
[53:31] pastor. Then then then you are ready
[53:33] yourself.
[53:35] When uh that breaker day comes,
[53:39] they were fighting. They're saying, "No,
[53:40] I got to go because it's the break of
[53:41] days. I'm not going to let you go. Give
[53:43] me my blessing to the law and to the
[53:45] testimony." If they speak not according
[53:48] to this word, it is because there's no
[53:50] light in them. It speaks about it as a
[53:52] as a dawn morning light. It's because
[53:54] there's been no break daybreak in in us.
[53:57] In second Peter 1:10 here, we're going
[53:59] to wrap it up here shortly. It says,
[54:01] "Wherefore the rather, brethren, give
[54:05] diligence." I I saw Jacob giving
[54:07] diligence. Uh the Lord and he said
[54:10] suddenly a desire came upon him.
[54:13] You know, he really repented to make
[54:17] your calling and election sure. For if
[54:21] you do these things, you shall never
[54:22] fall. I think you got to give diligence
[54:26] and you got to make your neighbors
[54:28] calling in election sure. It says your
[54:31] calling
[54:32] and election.
[54:35] Sure.
[54:36] Firm. Philippians we find
[54:40] in that very tongue, excuse me, and that
[54:43] every tongue shall confess that Jesus
[54:44] Christ is Lord
[54:47] to the glory of God the Father.
[54:49] Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always
[54:52] obeyed,
[54:54] not in my presence only, but now much
[54:56] more in my absence, worked out your
[54:59] salvation with fear and trembling.
[55:02] That's pretty good fitting to
[55:03] illustration we saw. He took the steps,
[55:06] brother. I mean, of course, it's the
[55:07] Lord that saves us not by works, but by
[55:09] grace and that we're saved by fa faith
[55:11] through Jesus Christ. And but but he did
[55:15] have to go through it. He had to go
[55:17] through repentance. It cannot be a fake
[55:18] repentance.
[55:20] Uh but simply put that you would have
[55:23] not even had an audience with the angel
[55:25] of the Lord for a whole night so that he
[55:29] can tell you who you were and your name
[55:31] and tell you that's not your name
[55:32] anymore. This is your name. Oh, by the
[55:35] way, this is my name. This is my
[55:37] blessing to you.
[55:39] Hallelujah, man. So
[55:42] it says for verse 13, it is God which
[55:46] workketh in you. See this is what
[55:47] happened to Jacob. It is God whose work
[55:49] is in you two things both to will to
[55:53] remember that desire that came upon him
[55:55] and then to do of his good pleasure.
[55:58] That was not at the work of Jacob. That
[56:00] was not a work of a deceiver going out
[56:01] there and asking for forgiveness.
[56:03] That desire he he worked two things. He
[56:06] he he he put a desire on it and then he
[56:09] actually helped them to do his good
[56:12] pleasure.
[56:14] the the faith that was one delivered to
[56:16] the saints. Just the some of these
[56:18] titles, right? Some just the titles
[56:20] alone. But what was the difference with
[56:23] Jacob? Jacob had the recompense to God.
[56:26] Had recompense to God. That birthright.
[56:28] Is that right? A perfect type.
[56:32] Somebody say, "Well, no. Here's a good
[56:35] man. He goes to church. He goes every
[56:38] Sunday. He's a good pay. He He's a good
[56:42] prayer in the church. He belongs to the
[56:44] best church in the city. He educates his
[56:47] children. He does all that's very fine.
[56:51] That's a good citizen. But brother, that
[56:54] has nothing to do with Christianity. Not
[56:57] a thing. You go to church, have your
[57:00] name on every book, every church book
[57:03] there is in Palm Beach or Florida.
[57:06] That's if you're having the wrong name,
[57:07] right? If you're having Jacob in there,
[57:09] it'll never do you one bit of good.
[57:13] Although the preacher can half mass the
[57:16] flag and say you went to heaven, but
[57:20] except you're born again, you're lost.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; The Lamb's Book of Life. Look at that
[57:28] title.
[57:31] Look at Esau and Jacob. Why? Esau was
[57:34] twice as good a good guy as Jacob.
[57:39] Look at that. Esau was twice as good a
[57:42] guy as Jacob. Sure he was. But Jacob had
[57:46] one thing. He had recompense to the
[57:49] reward. He seen that birthight.
[57:54] He counted it.
[57:57] The greatest thing on earth. I was
[58:00] wonder where did he see it?
[58:02] All right. Now, go back a little bit.
[58:05] This is Jacob who is his father.
[58:10] It was not Ismael.
[58:14] So, he's he's seen that battle. He's
[58:17] seen Heard stories. He He knew his dad.
[58:21] He had an example of his father. He had
[58:24] an Isaac.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; He's seen the birthright in action.
[58:31] It came to me earlier this night when I
[58:33] was reading. I was like, "A great thing
[58:34] on earth." He's seen that birthight.
[58:38] Where did he see it? I questioned that.
[58:40] And then Holy Spirit just taught me it's
[58:44] he who is his father
[58:46] Isaac. And then there was Abraham to.
[58:49] So he's seen the struggles. He's seen
[58:52] he's he's heard the testimonies. Now I
[58:54] share a testimony here about
[58:58] someone else actually
[59:00] But it was related to me.
[59:04] And Jacob was mama's boy. Little old
[59:07] testified storyteller. That's what he
[59:09] was. You have to admit it. I mean, the
[59:11] Bible admits, "Bring it. Brings it. Run
[59:15] around doing everything and mama hanging
[59:18] around with mama. But yet Jacob with all
[59:22] his ups and downs, his sisified ways, he
[59:25] still had respect to that birthright.
[59:29] That's the key note. Amen. Esau was
[59:34] twice the gentleman of Jacob. If we had
[59:38] to judge him today
[59:40] to be a member of our church, you would
[59:42] take Esau a thousand to one if you
[59:46] didn't know him. But God took Jacob.
[59:50] What would you do? Excuse me. He says,
[59:54] "What would you do with St. Paul
[59:57] if he wanted to be a minister?" It says
[1:00:00] here, "A little old hooked nose Jew and
[1:00:04] his mouth setting sideways
[1:00:07] going along just fuzzing. And now he's
[1:00:10] going to tear out the church. He's going
[1:00:13] to do everything. You thought he had
[1:00:17] committed the unpardonable sin.
[1:00:21] But God said he's my servant.
[1:00:25] What a mystery, brothers. Amen. I mean,
[1:00:28] these are those things that we just
[1:00:29] depend as like a get out of jail free
[1:00:31] card because yet he had to deal
[1:00:34] treacherously with u with Paul to be
[1:00:37] able to go through his conversion. He
[1:00:39] had to have his time where he had to go
[1:00:42] in shave his head and he had to go
[1:00:44] through it too. And
[1:00:46] he went in there and he u separated
[1:00:48] himself for all that time to to come to
[1:00:52] terms. I mean he was blinded right for
[1:00:54] once and the different things that
[1:00:57] happened to him and then later beaten
[1:00:59] and all all that. So I mean yeah
[1:01:04] I mean this the unbeliever is the
[1:01:07] unbeliever right? the part of you the
[1:01:09] sin the deceiver part of you we know
[1:01:12] that you know some of us outwardly have
[1:01:14] more scars than others
[1:01:16] but my look at look at the picture here
[1:01:18] of St. Paul said, "What would you do
[1:01:20] with him?" But God said, "He's my
[1:01:22] servant." You would thought he had
[1:01:24] committed the unpardonable sin.
[1:01:28] Help us, Lord. As I thought on my ways,
[1:01:31] when the angel of the Lord touched
[1:01:32] Jacob, he walked different from there on
[1:01:35] out. He was a big fine running coward on
[1:01:38] one side, but a limping prince on the
[1:01:41] other side of the brook.
[1:01:44] You walk different,
[1:01:46] you think different.
[1:01:48] He wasn't afraid to meet Esau then
[1:01:51] because he had wrestled with the angel.
[1:01:53] Think on your ways.
[1:01:55] What an advice. So we'll summarize here
[1:01:58] um what we've been teaching. So Jacob
[1:02:01] deceives
[1:02:03] and we saw that he well he made the deal
[1:02:06] and then later on he deceives his
[1:02:08] father. He said I mean he can you
[1:02:11] imagine how much thought had to go into
[1:02:12] that? It's like deliberate. It's like in
[1:02:14] law, right? they have like when there's
[1:02:16] an accident or somebody ends up like
[1:02:17] shooting or or or killing somebody by
[1:02:19] defense or so they always want to say
[1:02:21] what the intent was if there was
[1:02:23] possible intent and there's a big
[1:02:25] difference if you were just walking
[1:02:26] around and somebody comes at you and you
[1:02:27] just shoot at them because you know you
[1:02:29] felt threatened then when they can prove
[1:02:31] that you went out to go do that it was
[1:02:34] an intentional act.
[1:02:37] He intentionally put on those uh you
[1:02:40] know fixings to make himself be hairy
[1:02:42] and smell a certain way and deceive uh
[1:02:45] his fathers to his face, his father. I
[1:02:48] mean everyone around his mother and his
[1:02:50] brother. I mean he deceived he deceived
[1:02:52] everyone. He is then deceived by Laban.
[1:02:56] He flees from deceit from Laban after 20
[1:03:00] years. Then he calls on God and he
[1:03:01] repents for deceiving Esau and he seeks
[1:03:04] for forgiveness for deceiving. But look
[1:03:06] what happens then. Then he wrestles with
[1:03:08] the angel of the Lord.
[1:03:10] He prevails
[1:03:12] because it says that he prevailed not
[1:03:14] against him. The angel did not prevail
[1:03:17] against Jacob. He receives the touch in
[1:03:19] his thigh. I mean how many how many can
[1:03:22] remember having a a consequence in your
[1:03:24] own life? Sometimes in your spiritual in
[1:03:28] your spirit there's a scar or sometimes
[1:03:30] physically there's a scar or in your
[1:03:32] mind there's a scar. And it reminds me
[1:03:34] of
[1:03:36] essentially being governed. Like you
[1:03:38] know the old cars you used to step on
[1:03:39] the gas and they would just only go to a
[1:03:41] certain certain amount but they they're
[1:03:43] governed, right? That's how it feels
[1:03:44] sometimes. You you you have that still
[1:03:46] in you if you wrestle the Lord because
[1:03:48] you had a touch. I don't know
[1:03:50] everybody's testimony, but I know I'll
[1:03:52] speak for me and for Jacob here that I
[1:03:55] remember that and uh I had
[1:03:59] I have I've had consequences. I have the
[1:04:03] recompense
[1:04:05] and it's a general reminder.
[1:04:09] It's a general reminder. Sometimes it's
[1:04:10] not general,
[1:04:12] brother. Come on. Sometimes I mean just
[1:04:16] have you ever thought about Jacob? Here
[1:04:18] he comes Jacob and then um the next so
[1:04:21] he's meeting Esau but this how he's
[1:04:23] walking
[1:04:25] you know because maybe it was the next
[1:04:27] morning and we hadn't talk thought about
[1:04:29] the fact that
[1:04:31] he he had he had the touch in in his hip
[1:04:36] and in his tendon and has shrunk and
[1:04:40] just think about how it all happened a
[1:04:42] repented man he's my servant he said
[1:04:44] about Saul about and that so he prevails
[1:04:47] he receives receives the touch in his
[1:04:49] thigh. He then receives his name change
[1:04:52] which was as a prince. You have power
[1:04:55] with God and with man. And then he
[1:04:58] receives the blessing. He says, "You're
[1:05:00] not Jacob. You're not deceiver.
[1:05:03] Now you've repented. Now this is your
[1:05:05] name." And he says, "I pray tell me your
[1:05:07] name." And he blessed them there. Jesus
[1:05:11] Christ. Personal revelation to you.
[1:05:13] Amen. Then he was reconciled. Right? So
[1:05:16] think about it from a from a staff that
[1:05:18] he used with Laban in the years of his
[1:05:20] deceit.
[1:05:21] Figuratively speaking, he had a staff
[1:05:23] that he had to go work with, right? And
[1:05:25] then he said, "By this staff, I cross
[1:05:27] the river Jordan."
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; But then that staff became his walking
[1:05:31] sticks, brother.
[1:05:33] Now you have a prince with a cane.
[1:05:37] It's kind of doing this
[1:05:39] and and like I love how brother Bandham
[1:05:40] said it's it's a paradox because
[1:05:43] he physically he was walking crooked but
[1:05:45] he said that that old man hip
[1:05:48] made him walk straight.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; So don't tell me that that that general
[1:05:52] pain reminder you got or sometimes like
[1:05:54] I said more than gentle it's a reminder
[1:05:56] that boy let's keep in line let's keep
[1:05:59] straight right and I want to share a
[1:06:01] testimony. I was with um my wife and
[1:06:04] children. We were at a restaurant and uh
[1:06:07] in in downtown our town and we were
[1:06:10] eating breakfast. Everything was fine.
[1:06:12] It was just a beautiful Saturday
[1:06:13] morning. We were enjoying our time. All
[1:06:15] was well. And then at the very end just
[1:06:18] comes somebody from the back. I hadn't
[1:06:20] seen him. He just comes back to me, just
[1:06:22] taps my back and says, "Hey, you have a
[1:06:24] beautiful family." And then this man
[1:06:27] looked like in the natural he would have
[1:06:29] nothing to do with me because he looked
[1:06:31] like a pretty he looked like a like uh
[1:06:34] not like me in status of where he's
[1:06:37] alive and just u he looked like he could
[1:06:39] have been a a sheriff or just looked
[1:06:42] completely different than me. And at
[1:06:45] first I didn't get to see him because he
[1:06:47] just said, "Hey man, you know, you have
[1:06:49] a beautiful family." He complimented
[1:06:51] with such a, you know, with such a love.
[1:06:54] It wasn't one of those like I'm jealous
[1:06:56] of you or or he didn't say it with any
[1:06:58] external motives and he just said you
[1:07:00] have a beautiful family.
[1:07:02] And then I felt blessed and he walked
[1:07:05] around and I started talking to my wife
[1:07:08] and and I said, "Did you hear? Did you
[1:07:10] see that guy?" But I could only see very
[1:07:12] little cuz he just tapped me and goes
[1:07:13] right along. And then I said, "There's
[1:07:16] something different about that guy." I
[1:07:17] told him, "There's something different
[1:07:19] about that guy." And then he pays, you
[1:07:21] know, you can the table is right here,
[1:07:23] so he couldn't see a whole lot of
[1:07:24] action. And he starts walking over here.
[1:07:26] And as soon as he comes to my site where
[1:07:28] he can I can see him walking,
[1:07:30] he was doing this. And it seemed like a
[1:07:33] old veteran or old sheriff, old
[1:07:35] policeman who's walking like that. And
[1:07:38] he had a a very clear-cut in in
[1:07:42] in his walk. And I told my it brought me
[1:07:45] to tears because I told my wife, I knew
[1:07:48] it. I knew it. you know, character just
[1:07:51] doesn't come by like that.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; You see, this is a man that was able to
[1:07:55] recognize a blessing and and and that's
[1:07:58] because like Jacob, right? He went
[1:07:59] through those 20 years of being
[1:08:01] deceived.
[1:08:03] So then he can be able to say, "Ah, this
[1:08:05] is what I did to my brother, flee the
[1:08:07] seed, fled Laban, and went straight."
[1:08:12] And that night it said when he just
[1:08:15] heard that now Esau's coming.
[1:08:18] That night is when he made it right with
[1:08:19] the Lord. And again, it wasn't when he
[1:08:22] gave him the red pottage that he
[1:08:24] received the birthright. That's when he
[1:08:26] made that transaction, right? And Jake,
[1:08:28] that's when Jacob uh that's when Esau
[1:08:29] despised it. And he said his own he had
[1:08:31] another name. He said, "I'm Edom. You
[1:08:32] I'm faint. That's my name. Uh why would
[1:08:35] I need it? I'm about to die. No hope
[1:08:37] against hope." And and it went from
[1:08:40] there to then he outrightly deceived his
[1:08:43] dad, his father, you know, asking for
[1:08:45] the blessing, but that didn't give him a
[1:08:47] birthight either. He went straight to go
[1:08:49] work for 20 years and be deceived. Then
[1:08:52] he was in a position to ask for
[1:08:54] forgiveness. Then he called on the Lord
[1:08:56] that night. Then he was blessed of the
[1:09:00] Lord um with Israel.
[1:09:04] Remember he had his 11 children. They
[1:09:06] said it. So Joseph was already on the
[1:09:08] scene. That that to me struck me when he
[1:09:10] says he took his two wives, his two
[1:09:12] woman servants and 11 sons.
[1:09:16] Sons. Amen. So he was already working in
[1:09:20] the background.
[1:09:21] And and I just wanted to really say,
[1:09:23] brothers, that I believe that we're left
[1:09:26] with the remark. We're left with a scar.
[1:09:28] We're left with something. Um when we I
[1:09:31] think the Lord very precisely dealt with
[1:09:34] Jacob cuz he he gave him really out of
[1:09:37] his own medicine, right? He said, "Oh,
[1:09:39] you're deceived." So
[1:09:41] feel what it's like to be deceived for
[1:09:42] 20 years. And like I said, he didn't try
[1:09:45] him with something else. He didn't try
[1:09:46] him with with um things that were
[1:09:48] outside of whatever he did. He he said,
[1:09:50] "This is what you did. See see the
[1:09:53] effect of it." And and that's how he had
[1:09:55] his testimony. That how that's how he
[1:09:57] had his conversion. He really um he
[1:10:00] really uh cried out. He went through the
[1:10:02] process as we saw of getting that name
[1:10:04] changed of getting that blessing working
[1:10:06] for that birthright. And brother Brandon
[1:10:07] typified it. That birthright is being
[1:10:10] born again. It is the baptism of the
[1:10:11] Holy Ghost. It is it says don't neglect
[1:10:14] it. Boy, woman, uh children, men,
[1:10:18] receive um receive the blessing the Lord
[1:10:20] has for you. Musicians, if you can come
[1:10:22] up, I wanted to sing a song that's very
[1:10:23] fitting to what we heard here.
[1:10:27] Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you,
[1:10:29] brothers.
[1:10:41] Brothers in the back, if you could put
[1:10:42] this the lyrics to I would not be
[1:10:45] denied,
[1:10:47] sister. Was it C? Yeah.
[1:11:07] When pains of death seized on my soul,
[1:11:13] unto the Lord I cried,
[1:11:18] till Jesus came and made behold.
[1:11:24] I would not be denied.
[1:11:30] I would not be deny.
[1:11:35] Oh, I would not be denied.
[1:11:41] Till Jesus came and made me whole. I
[1:11:47] would not feed.

[1:11:57] home, I wrestle
[1:12:00] with the Lord. Amen. And instant and
[1:12:04] instant with faker
[1:12:09] I stood upon
[1:12:12] his word
[1:12:14] for I would not be denied.
[1:12:20] Oh no I would not be deny. He had a name
[1:12:25] change until Jesus came and made me
[1:12:31] whole. I would not be denied. Now look
[1:12:36] what happened now.
[1:12:38] Oh, Satan said my Lord was done. He's a
[1:12:43] liar and would not hear my prayer.
[1:12:49] The praise the Lord, the work is done
[1:12:54] and Christ the Lord is here.
[1:12:59] He said I would not be no denied.
[1:13:05] No, I would not be
[1:13:11] until Jesus blessed me. Until he gave me
[1:13:14] that name change and he gave me his
[1:13:16] birthight, his revelation of his name.
[1:13:18] He changed my name. Hallelujah. I'll say
[1:13:21] that again one more time. I'll Jesus be.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; You won't be denied.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; I will not be deny
[1:13:34] till Jesus came and made me whole. I
[1:13:40] would not be now.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; I want to say it again.
[1:13:45] As Jacob in the days alone,
[1:13:51] I wrestled with the Lord. I say and in
[1:13:57] stand with a courage boy. I stood upon
[1:14:04] his word.
[1:14:07] I would not be denied.
[1:14:13] I would not be enough
[1:14:18] till Jesus came
[1:14:23] home. I would not be

[1:15:01] the soul this evening as we get prepared
[1:15:03] to leave. Amen.
[1:15:08] The world will try to satisfy
[1:15:15] that longing
[1:15:17] in your soul.
[1:15:20] You may search the world,
[1:15:27] but you will be just as before.
[1:15:32] You'll never find
[1:15:35] true satisfaction
[1:15:38] until you have found the Lord.
[1:15:44] For only Jesus
[1:15:47] can satisfy

[1:17:57] Only Jesus
[1:18:01] can satisfy
[1:18:04] your soul. Brother Louise, you come up
[1:18:06] and dismiss this for
[1:18:19] Praise the Lord. Let's just bow our
[1:18:20] heads. Lord Jesus, we thank you, Father,
[1:18:22] for the opportunity to have come,
[1:18:24] Father, to hear your word, Lord. And I
[1:18:27] pray, Lord God Almighty, that
[1:18:30] these words, Father God, that were
[1:18:32] spoken, Lord, that they may be heavenly
[1:18:35] father, more than just words to us, Lord
[1:18:38] God, but they may be a life, Lord Jesus.
[1:18:41] Because, Father God, your word, Lord,
[1:18:43] can make us sometimes walk, Father God,
[1:18:47] and humble us, Lord Jesus, like you
[1:18:50] humbled Jacob, Lord. And I pray, Father,
[1:18:52] that
[1:18:54] every word, Father God, that was spoken
[1:18:57] today, Lord, in the life of Jacob, Lord
[1:19:00] Jesus. May it be a reflection, Father
[1:19:03] God, unto our lives, Lord Jesus, that we
[1:19:06] need more and more of you, Lord. No
[1:19:08] matter how old we are, no matter how
[1:19:10] young we are, Lord God, we need that
[1:19:12] true experience that can only come from
[1:19:15] you. Father, I pray Lord that you give
[1:19:18] strength to brother Emanuel. We
[1:19:19] appreciate Lord God him giving himself
[1:19:22] over to you, Lord God, so that you could
[1:19:25] so that you could use his lips, Lord.
[1:19:28] And Lord, bless your people now on the
[1:19:29] way back home. Just thank you, Father
[1:19:32] God, for uh giving us another
[1:19:34] opportunity to be here, Lord. It was
[1:19:36] good to say that it was good to be in
[1:19:38] the house of the Lord. Bring us back
[1:19:41] safely, Father God, on Sunday to worship
[1:19:44] you in spirit and in truth and to feast
[1:19:46] upon your word. We love you and we thank
[1:19:48] you, Father. We ask these things now in
[1:19:50] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:19:54] Make you
[1:19:59] give you peace
[1:20:02] you knew. Sweet love and joy.
