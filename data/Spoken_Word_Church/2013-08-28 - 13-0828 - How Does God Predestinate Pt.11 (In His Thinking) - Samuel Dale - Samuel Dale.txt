hello shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we see holy holy holy amen shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing Holy Holy Holy holy holy holy holy I want to see you amen and amen you want to see him and look into his word so that's the way we see him today right good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like turning your scripture turn where we've been reading in Romans 8 and then we'll go to Isaiah 55. Romans 8 Isaiah 55. now this much kind of an odd month falling over so remember the Bible study will be the seventh of next month not falling this one because this coming Saturday's the 31st so I'm just caution you that away sometimes you miss the times you say well it's got to be this week but it's it falled on a different one all right good to be in the house of the Lord glad have waited him back with us pray that the Lord would blessed remember uh brother claude's wife Ginger there her father passed away this week so remember that and just keep them in your prayers she's was doing real good today I've talked to her for a moment she was doing okay so you know just remember the family okay Romans 8 in Isaiah 55. the heavenly father we thank you Lord Jesus for your grace and your love unto us thank you for all things that you've given unto us and Lord we realized that we didn't do anything to get it and even the Revelation itself is Sovereign but we thank you we Praise Your Great Name and just bless you Lord and we ask that you would come Among Us and bless us with your presence in your your grace and guidance open our eyes that we may see and Lord just hold our hands unless we fail you and help us to walk in your word we love you and we thank you bless all of these thank you for being with a little baby there in New Mexico now she's at home and everything so you just make everything work out lord it's all into your hands because we believe you anyway and father we've asked you to guide and and bless each thought tonight in your word in Jesus name amen Romans 8. 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called him he also justified in whom he justified them he also glorified you know just past tense already done set up everything all right what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us amen let's go over to Isaiah and just read a word to our from where we've been quoting a lot about it and things and let's just read it in uh Isaiah 55 verse 6. says seek ye the Lord while he may be found call you upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake their way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let them return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him and to our and to our God for the he will abundantly pardon for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts amen you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now we're stop we're still on the point of dealing with how does God predestinate and we've been dealing with that for quite a while now and we see that he predestinates by foreknowledge and we know then that for knowledge becomes before predestination I keep saying that over and over and it's uh you know I say a lot of things over and over and over you know why because most people's brains don't run correctly and mine is one of them and if I'm not repetitive then you know you won't get my point I don't want any thought to be whatsoever of us being any form or whatsoever or maybe take away the word form um persons or personalities or or people or anything like that uh in heaven before the world ever begun and and I keep putting that there before you because I know that that a lot of doctrines are out there about the the predestinations and the things you know but I I want to hold that before you to where no matter what I would be saying you remember that this is what he's saying and then you come along say yeah but what he what he's doing he's trying to trick us you know he's he's about no no I don't try to trick anything I've never been that way I just don't have any ability to trick I just have what I am and that is to just study the word and believe what it says all right and in doing that then we know that the prophet of God is the the one that brings us the message and he's told us over and over that foreknowledge comes before predestination all right and that's the only way that God can predestinate without him being choosing whatsoever now when we get on into it now if you're noticing we're over past the line going in back into God's mind all right and in doing that then just remember that his mind cannot be anything different from what happens in reality because the I kept saying that there are Sunday the fact of foreknowledge means the knowledge before that's simple to me it's just you have knowledge before and God's the only one who can have those things but in doing it see looking back then we see that God had a plan and a purpose or a motive you know there's another quote over a plan and a purpose we'll get back to that in another message because it's in the middle of it and I didn't want to read part of it that he had a plan and a purpose Sovereign plan right right across the mystery of God reveals he's got a motive in doing in order to let himself be expressed so then whatever we tie together we must put it together in the order of thinking about and lining it up to be able to come back to where we would look at his uh plan and purpose or motive you know see it would have to tie together to where it would not be contradictory to other thoughts and all of it would line up together and and we would see a beautiful picture in the word of God because if it's not by foreknowledge then what are you going to go by see if it's not foreknowledge first you're predetermining right right and if you're predetermining then you know we just forget it because well if we happen to fall on the lucky side and I don't mean that sarcastically I just mean it true because that's just the way people are we happen to be a certain seed you know if it's in Adam that's the way they used to preach it you could be saved but if you come from the Beast you couldn't be saved well time you got to the flood you had a problem and then when you get over to Jacob and Esau coming from the same holy Mom and Daddy you see I keep bringing those things up because that I know what people teach and what they're trying to plant into the people's minds but I want you and I to keep it in the correct line so if I repeat anything just remember maybe it's for me all right so you just forgive me and pass on to the next message and lay out a couple of services and catch back up somewhere down the line because everybody thinks I repeat myself so much so you've missed three or four services and then you just come back and then you can catch up and just go right on and and don't listen to what's in between but that's all right that's your business if you don't listen we have made ever effort a possible of the internet systems to work in the tape recorders and the things or the the doings that the word that you have no excuse of saying well I wasn't there that service so I'm not going to take the time hey we got a good run coming in we got a Dale coming in yeah good to see you really yeah that's he's dead on the front end I'm the back end Dale okay all right but good to see you brother Dave for the robbers yeah but now think about it for knowledge is the most wonderful thought that you could ever have because by thinking about it and you're looking at it and you're seeing that by foreknowledge then you do have something to do with your life and your beings now sure we know salvations of the Lord and I know the quotes come on the prophet will say you had nothing to do with your salvation amen that's exactly right because you couldn't save yourself but if you didn't accept it you must accept it because he will not override your free moral agency all right now then as we we've read over and over and quoted many times brother random says on on this God change his mind uh see God couldn't purposely lose anything and then redeem it couldn't do it that way he says he couldn't now why would we want to think of those things with that order but see he put man on free Mortal agency but be in God he goes into marriage and divorce and says to take and to lose it just in order to save it would be disconplementary to his own doings but see we're so uh relevated until we we think nothing about those things but if we approach everything by foreknowledge then we can see and we can back up because we've been I haven't denied any quote yet have I if I have bring me one you know of any quote that he's brought I've tried to to bring them all in until you know not everyone because you'd uh I've I've told you if you just start in 1963 and go through 65 you're going to hear of the things that I'm trying my best to express to you but see then in doing that then keeping our thoughts to the bases that God then could actually dwell alone with his thoughts and that not be people man so you don't realize those things are Mormon doctrines and things like that are coming down from organized religion the prophet of God said ever a denomination Doctrine and things come out of Genesis so you can go back in Genesis with it you know and find out but just trying to get you to look at it that he doesn't predestinate by his desires because he desired that everybody be saved all right so now what kind of a God are you making him to be if you're coming up with all of these predetermined factors and situations yet I've told you over and over we're going back into the very back part of God's Mind by way of the prophet and by way of that and thinking about it and seeing him and seeing what he has looked down through time and saw that would be but that's not all of his doings because he had attributes in him as a savior A Healer Etc before anybody was ever lost those were in him at the beginning when he dwelt alone and by being that then you and I are a display and what a wonderful thought that we could think about I know you don't think the way I do I'm I'm glad of that mostly because it'd be a messed up world but sometimes I think I do get a little good thought you know every once in a while but to just think about that God came down here to share eternal life with you and I but yet we want some kind of a doings to her that if you go into the predetermining doctrines and the ideas and thoughts of man you'll get to the point that you don't need God right I mean you don't need him and he's nothing personal to you he's just sitting over the end of this thing waiting when it's all to finish but thinking about foreknowledge the prophet said he knew who would want to be saved and who wouldn't he said Darby he could have it for them he came and died for everybody in the world right but everybody in the world is not going to accept it right all right now if he could could uh set back before the world and think about it and plan it out look what you would have our thinking as reading I read that scripture that our thoughts are not his thoughts his thoughts are so much brother Colony spoke on that probably what 40 years ago his thoughts are so great our thoughts are not even in the picture the best thoughts we could have and look what it took it took a profit 30 something years to bring a message to get you and I to a place that we could look without having to bypass everything and say he was wrong here and wrong here and should have said this there in order done this year and yeah but yet people just Joyce about that you know yeah that's right he should have done it that way well just remember his thoughts is greater than yours so that thought you got is stupid any other language you need to use dumb that's as best as you can say it even a good thought the best we could do with it what's it going to be God cannot have a new thought the prophet said now what are you going to do what kind of thoughts do we have we can change them every 30 seconds probably less than that but he can never and then when he said it he took from his thoughts you know and he put into word form those thoughts and once putting it into word form that's why we can depend upon what he's saying because he can't change then we just got to find our own selves and see where we're at sure we're going to get to I believe all the prophet has taught us I've been over and over and we keep going over and over he said if you have eternal life tonight you always was eternal right I can say Amen to that but then he says You must be born again I say Amen to that now you can't say Amen to both of them if you've got a dog a Doctrine or idea of pre-existences and things see you can't Amen to all the whole word I can so I opened it up to the public then you know if I'm off come and show me I want to be right but don't come up with silly ideas well we'll give you quotes we got 200 quotes here go ahead you keep studying long enough you might find something you know what I mean by that you might get caught by the truth by searching out to try to prove somebody wrong so go ahead but listen see if we have eternal life today that life that he's talking about is what it is right it's not me and you there was a time we didn't have eternal life we haven't always was eternal I just feel it I just I just well it never was on feeling it's not what God says he says You must be born again the Nicodemus now Nicodemus had a pretty good understanding of the word you agree but when he said you must be born again he said boy you blowed me you know I don't understand what you're talking about he said well there's no need me talking to you about it because see there's really no need of talking to anybody about God unless they've got the same God living within them because the Bible says no man can call Jesus the Christ what except it be by the Christ that's within you but see we we make statements and talks in in all but not thinking about we're dealing with an eternal God I said something there Sunday that I wanted to make sure you understood and uh you know you'd be surprised how people are and I made a simple statement I wonder how many of you had ever really thought about charging with this is it just a little I thought of today I thought well I need to clear that up real good I said God's name is Jesus now is that really ever dawned on you have you ever really thought about it or what kind of a name are you trying to find Jehovah's not a name Yahweh is not a name elohim's not a name what is the name of God well if we could just find his name his name is Jesus Christ his name is Jesus and the prophet of God said everything is named Jesus for it's the only name that God ever had that's why they couldn't pronounce it as jvhv see they just couldn't get it there was no vowels or what you say to pronounce it but his name was Jesus what a simple thought but do you really know what that means we're quick to say well ask anything in my name so we ask in Jesus name we're asking Jesus name but you know what's the worst thing about it is is people not being honest enough to admit where we've been tied up at I told you about it when the man came to the church there wasn't a Baptist Church and increased all you do and word indeed do all in the name of Jesus Christ that church would never pray in the name of Jesus Christ they prayed for the for God's sake or in his name whole church preachers and all they wouldn't say in the name of Jesus they started praying in the name of Jesus well that was good but you know what I've seen and I had to go get baptized that's what I saw because if his name was Jesus I couldn't hang on to father son Holy Ghost any longer I had to find something because father son Holy Ghost not a name but the Simplicity of it I mean do we really even think about it that God's never had but one name right and his name is Jesus see everybody in the message now want to find some kind of a new name since they've got a little bit of a thought but my thought is have we exhausted the name of Jesus yet do my understanding the name of Jesus must remain until the Redemptive plan is done I mean if I'm wrong there somebody show me that's all I know because it's the name of Jesus means Redeemer then the prophet would make a statement and people don't want to read that he said maybe no one we get tired fine with a new name if he wants God wants to give it right but what is it going to be related to his name has never been nothing but Jesus but yet brother random will say you can call him Jesus Jesus and not get nothing why why did you say Jesus Jesus is together and not get nothing somebody else come along and just say Jesus and they just get what they're asking for you know God knows whether or not we know what that name is you remember the little woman there in the Bible that said thou son of David have mercy on me he wouldn't even listen to her why she wasn't a Jewish he was a gentile she had no reason or thoughts to connect to him but when she said my Lord that stopped him and he came and gave her what she asked for amen you see the name of Jesus when a prophet would come along and would say God chosen place of worship in God's name is given to him he's God's place of worship and God's name is given to him the name of Jesus do we really think about that when he come and say like this God's provided place of worship His Name Was God how many titles God is a title itself was a call Jehovah Gyra Jehovah jovik Manasseh he was called a Rose of Sharon and Lily of the Valley Morning Star father son Holy Ghost but his name God's name is Jesus Christ God's name The Only Name that God ever had but everybody wants to know what his name is his name is Jesus many titles but his name is Jesus and in his son he placed his name that's on God's provided place of worship paragraph 136. God has only provided way it isn't Methodist Presbyterian but it's Jesus Christ by the new birth believe in that Bible that's God's provided way and the only way that he has is in Jesus Christ his son and his son he placed his name his God's name is Jesus because he came in his father's name and so that would be God's name because he was God how much more simple can we be what I got to thinking about reason I said I believe need to cover it is we think well if if Jesus if the name of Jesus if the name of God is Jesus why didn't brother Branham emphasize that over and over and over why don't you go turn a telephone when you get home tonight and listen to it no matter what it is from 47 to 65. and see if he's not explaining the name of God you might say he's the chosen place of worship Jesus said I come in my father's name every son comes in in father's name what's the name of the father how many times have you heard him say that he's okay now let's let's go through what he said it's you know it says in the name of the father son holy said what's the name of the father he says Jesus he said what's the name of the son Jesus what's the name of the Holy Ghost Jesus now we don't baptize Jesus Jesus Jesus do we no we baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because that way it covers every title talk or anything time together with that one name that's the only name that God ever had why are we looking for some name well I'm sure you where the Prophet was looking for a name amen but what is it did he ever tell what it was but how many people admit and to be honest about themselves and thinking but they no they won't do that to hide it first time you've heard me tell you first time we went to Jeffersonville I was sitting there looking around you know and I thought and my thoughts was about the name of the Lord and different things and I looked up there and right onto that cross under there was INRI I wrote that down I run around our brother molt in the service is over I said brother mode what does it mean i n r i he said that was Latin or Greek or what it was written in so it means Jesus Christ King of the Jews I said okay see you later I didn't tell him what I was thinking I thought I'd found his new name but will you just be honest enough to think about it if we're going to be Miss Jesus when we get over there and I want to hold on to that name don't you because that is the name of almighty God and that almighty God is eternal self-existing I am all the title of whatsoever in his name is Jesus could we approach my point okay my point are you listening what's your point about the name what was your point Sunday about tonight if we approach predestinations and foreknowledges and things like that with our own thinking we're going to wind up being no different than trying to find some certain name when he's already told us his name looking for something that we're trying to find looking for some way but but brother Dale I know but when brother so-and-so preaches about I always was eternal I just feel so I just it just Thrills me but when you say it I just well you know you know the why because you know what I'm talking about you know that I'm not talking about coming into the world with eternal life dwelling inside of you and just waiting for somebody to click the light bulb where it could turn on and I didn't need nothing I always was eternal but see you know that other person is talking about something else and remember Sunday what is the big guy we face ego ego ego stirs this man revelation you can walk on you understand the reason of bringing it up are we approaching these things just by thoughts if you notice I'm laying in about one God I'm talking about you know he's thinking and you and I and our relationship and we'll get to it because I don't believe in eternal sonship see we only place that is to being about Jesus are we a child of God that has eternal life being part of the father are we a child by impartation from something else which one is it the way that I'm headed now I'm warning you ahead of time I don't believe in eternal sonship I don't believe anymore I don't believe in it for Jesus and I don't believe in it for me and you I'm not a son of Jesus that was the son of God no I same life for the one that was walking on the Earth to live within me and I must receive that right but yet why can't we think then by that way in keeping our line and our thought in correct order of of God dealing with it and knowing what he's going to do and what we'll do when we get down here and why can't we look to God and say thank you Lord for revealing yourself unto us helping us to see you and who you are I thought the prophet if God said when the bride realizes who she is and what she's here for she'll be an invincible Army that's my understanding well well brother so and so he he really makes it like that that I can see who I am that I was back before the world now what are you talking about all right what are you talking about your body your spirit your soul or what are you talking about what was back before the world the only one that I know was back before the world was eternal God that's the only way I don't know I could understand I mean if I'm wrong forgive me and that's just the way I believe it I believe there's only one Elohim self-existing God and his name is Jesus but it took 4 000 years for that one name to come into existence right and that one name was used after he was conceived in the womb in the name of Jesus but yet you can go all the way through the Old Testament and find it and speaking of him to come then when the prophet will say you always was eternal what's he talking about I mean hey we definitely know that we're not he wasn't talking about these bodies right they're getting older and our spirit within us reasons for the world and the things he said well it's got to be in that Soul then and if I was just in God's thinking well remember Judas was in his thinking his name was written in the Book of Life but where it was removed when he rejected Jesus Christ well your Prophet explains it Rejoice not that the devils are subject unto you but but your name is written in heaven the prophet of God is looking at all of these today he said Jesus told those disciples said I knew you before the foundation of the world now you won't find a scripture exactly stating it that way but you're getting what the prophet says it's stating Paul sums it up by saying we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world but now what part of us was back there that's that's the point I wanted to get to what part of us what part of you and I was before the world was there any part of these human elements that we live in back there well no brother Dale we was in his thinking well good then but you know Judas was too Lucifer was in his thinking Lucifer was in his thinking before Judas was ever in his thinking right the anointed cherub because the Angels were created first well then anything now so here's the point and then we'll get into something we want to keep lining up with any thought of anything whatsoever as to being back there outside of the Eternal God you see where we're going the Mormon doctrine that we were up in heaven running around at little peoples and yeah they got a lot of other doctrines too what was it brother dick that Jesus and Satan was or Lucifer was Brothers no a lot of things come on out you'd be surprised how many they are in the message you know when you've got two souls and two Lords and all kind of things but I asked a question over and over how does God predestinate then he has to have the foreknowledge before he predestinates you remember I've kept on saying to you I said be careful you can predestinate yourself out of existence no see then if predestination followers after foreknowledge and all you can deal with is predestinating you've done predestinated yourself out of existence because I've done backed up to foreknowledge which is further back than you're predetermining so you've done you've done push your stuff out of existence do you understand well that may be this carnal thoughts but that's it's true if all you can do is say I'm a predestinated seed and I believe in that I got the quotes laying on the desk but if you're a predestinated seed is that as far back as you can go asking you a simple question how far back can you go by revelation and we've already covered in two services so don't get excited about it that which is it wasn't for the prophet of God you and I could not in no way go back into the back part of God's mind and I covered it about three times in each service that you think you're so great revelated you say brother Dale you don't think I can get it without the prophet I know you can't ain't no thoughts no problem oh like I told you about the man says we're going to be out Beyond brother Brandon I said okay he's preached us to the Future home now tell me if it's the future home you're going to tell me tell me past well he packed his Dutch and left did he realized real quick that I didn't have much use for his Doctrine because come on if you're going to tell me more about you see you know you can't do it but it ain't going to convert nobody you're not going to convert nobody God is the only one that can convert anybody salvation is of the Lord Minds can be converted thoughts can be can be converted house changing can IC place we can move around and jump about and scream and holler all we want to about what we believe but a revelation changes things and only those who have the new birth can understand predestination and foreknowledge in mind if I put it a little blunt if you don't put it in the correct order what good is it so if all you deal with predestination I'm predestinated now quote brother Branham say the little woman as well she's a predestinated seat amen he said it come alive now did she get eternal life that day the only question I'm asking you Jesus hadn't died yet so what's he get she got a revelation of what was taking place or who was standing there before her she never got eternal life because Jesus spoke to her even when he breathed on them disciples and said receive ye the Holy Ghost the prophet said that was not the new birth he said that was a promise well but what were we back there so there's a time you're going to have to to get away from your predestinated form predetermining form or factor and it leads back up to foreknowledge because the prophet said in the Bible said those who he foreknew we just read he did predestinate it doesn't say those he predestinated he finally wound up knowing them you're converting the Bible to your own thoughts you see then that way I can sit here tonight and think you know you had a choice whether you wanted to come to church tonight or not you know God was looking down at that it's your choice well you don't think brother Dale I'd like to stay at home God reveal it to me nope don't think so is that blunt enough playing enough old Georgia ain't English I don't believe you can stay at home and eat it on your own or else why would it say there's a FireFold Ministry and I still haven't got to that doctor yet have I the nine spiritual gifts don't come predestinated eternally those are gifts and callings in the body of Christ that even a sinner can have them but the five-fold ministry comes predestinated eternally from God now thou didn't say ever preacher to hollers and says he's a preacher and all the women and all of that too you know that says they're a preacher that ain't what I'm talking about I'm talking about a true faithful Ministry that comes predestinated eternally amen amen you believe Jesus come predestinated eternally I do you see there's a lot to be said yet so just don't think we've run out we're just now getting over far enough to be able to talk about it to where we can really understand what is it to think about in God's thinking in God's thinking that's the title of the message what does it mean in God's thinking when Judas was in God's thinking at the same time he thought of you coming into the world and yeah he thought of Judas coming into the world what does it mean in his thinking what does that really mean I know I laid a lot on for knowledge all right and kept emphasizing for knowledge his knowledge before all right I've kept on saying that over and over until I hope that it's dawned on you that what that is foreknowledge is first well now in his thinking so there must be a dividing line in understanding what it means to be in his thinking are the thoughts of God the prophet of God said the thoughts of God are eternal now come on when he thought of judas's carrot he thought of what he would do when he thought of Jacob and Esau he thought of what they would do and that thought could never be changed there's your predestinations his thought was eternal about Judas is carrot but yet he couldn't make Judas be wrong so his thought would be of What Judas would wind up being himself and what he would desire and the thoughts he would go same as Jacob and Esau the thoughts of God are eternal if I'm never to be saved then God knew why I would never be saved and his thoughts let it be that obey and I can't change that well why me try brother Dale because I don't know that I'm not able to be saved what about you well I I believe Brother David I'm able to be saved because I believe the word all right that gives us a connecting line but it doesn't make us eternal but what does it mean in his thinking right around him used that phrase a lot in his thinking so if he was never in his thinking you will never be in his thinking what is he meaning when Judas was in his thinking so now maybe it'll don't own you about what 30 years that I've been saying this I don't want to be in God's thinking I want to be a part of his thinking well that's all of a sudden no it's not because Judas was in his thinking but Judas wasn't a part of God right amen so to say in his thinking you remember we drawed a thing and we covered the mind and we covered the thoughts of God and we said we got to back up now back up into a higher form or thinking by well the prophet back into the back part of God's mind and get back there and say what is it to think about in his thinking so there's a lot of difference in what he thought of and something that's a part of him see that way I believe the eternal life that you have tonight by the new birth is a part of almighty God not just him thinking not just to say that I'm in his mind Paul didn't say that Paul said let the mind that's in Christ be in you it'll make you a new creature his mind or he's thinking but to think about his thinking is so much beyond our thinking until we don't even there's no way to comprehend it but yet if we can just get away from our carnality in our doctrines that we've believed well brother Dale I just believe I always was eternal well now what are you talking about that's the only question I have well I really don't know but I believe it was something in me well why don't you believe it's a new birth because that's the only thing in you that can be eternal why not believe that God gave you eternal life he had to die to release that life that could come back in you amen and live in you Paul to say now it's not I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me and the life that I now live and be flesh I live by the Faith Of Thee Son of God Amen amen but if I was just in his thinking I don't want to be that in the last couple of messages now I've been dealing with this point of being a part of God now that's going a little bit too far now brother Dale I think we can be Sons and Daughters of God by the new birth but I don't think we can be part of God I don't think your cranium cap is working your brain see you're trying to be a son of somebody else instead of being God made manifest in human flesh now it's not just too much now that's too much now that's now I don't like that because you're saying it's your God no I'm saying What God Says Paul said on Mars Hill where his offspring well now are you a son of somebody that's a son of God and remember Jesus Christ never come to what is the quote from the prophet I'm trying to get into mine he come to bring us to eternal life he never came to bring your inheritance your inheritance is eternal life before the world but he come to make a way to receive that inheritance he never died to just say give you eternal life he died that everybody could receive eternal life but yet God knowing who would and who wouldn't what is it what does it mean then to be in the mind of God or in his thinking or to be a thought of God there's a vast difference in what you think of and your real thoughts I tried to explain that the other day so come on will you get it you can sit there right now and thank all kind of dirty thoughts you want to is that a part of you come on Satan put some in your mind you put them in the mind of Jesus but see I want to be a part of that one that was doing the thinking you went too far now because you're you're trying to say that we're God what are you what I want an answer from you what I oh we're the sons of God sons of God I'm not going too far in that because I got the message the notes are laying back there do you believe in eternal sonship I believe in eternal godship what do you believe in other words what do you mean what Jesus Christ come and saved you he died for you have to admit that right man I mean you got to say we got eternal life by Jesus Christ come and paying the price and then the Holy Ghost could come to give us eternal life okay does that make you the terminologies and form of the words we call son when a son has a beginning right John's our beginning I thought Eternal had no beginning do we really understand the godhead you know that random said he believed an eternal godhead do we believe in eternal sonship no no no no we don't believe in that now well then if you don't believe in Eternal sonship then Jesus must have been God made manifest in flesh call the son right right but there's no scripture where it calls him God the Father God the son and God the Holy Ghost that's that's one of our favorites ain't it there's no scripture for that save you time going home and looking it up it'll say son of God but not God the son because there's no such words see if you have eternal life dwelling in you who are you yeah but that's just a little bit too far now because you're just putting us out there a little bit too far now brother tell you be careful oh yeah I've been 40 something years being careful because I believe just 40 something years ago and preached it 40 something years ago and I still believe it I believe a child of God is God made manifest in the human vessel the only difference was that he came into the world Body Spirit and soul the body of creation of God the spirit Eternal God himself and the soul of almighty God living in that body that you and I come into the world lost and doomed and on our way to Hell Body Spirit and soul lost amen amen and received eternal life by the new birth now we are The Offspring of God dwelling in a body but still have a spirit and a body that's messed up right right but yet in that Soul we have eternal life that eternal life has always been eternal life eternal life doesn't have a beginning so what are we just get a couple of quotes because I know England but far but we'll continue this Sunday because I'm just trying to get one point to our mind one thing that's why I keep going over it and over and I'll keep on if you get bored over me repeating myself and doing it you just lay out a few weeks and come every once in a while you'll catch back up I'm not sarcastic I'm just telling you that's if that's the way you think but you see Church the only way you can go back any further than a predestinated form is to back up into God's Mind by way of a prophet's message and let God speak to you and I and tell us the secrets just like we know and believe what happened into Genesis because Moses went back into the back part of God's mind and got from God what happened in the garden I don't think Moses sitting with you well I'm going to write this down but I don't know they ate an apple well of course we know he didn't write it that way but that's what we think he didn't know what's going on when I first heard that Prophet it wouldn't long after beginning the message I believe one thing about serpency I believe them all Pharisees they knew what happened in the guard because they told Jesus we wasn't born like you we weren't born that way we have a pure lineage and we have circumcision to prove it they believe circumcision done away with a the sex part of the garden that's what I believe whether that's right or not that's all right that's just what I believe so it ain't costing you nothing but listen to back up into his thinking as to not be just something he thought of now we'll get to it Lord when probably Sunday we're in job where the Morning Star saying together the Son of God shouted for Joy see that's got to be placed in the correct place because if not then you you've got a problem all right we're Spirits back to our brother random questions and answers in 59. paragraph 167. no we were not even nothing then we were only figurative in his mind how many times we read that over and over and over only figurative in his mind were we Spirits no we wasn't nothing but in God's mind we were and he spoke it and it materialized and Jesus was slain how many knows that Jesus was slain for the foundation word right but were we spirits no were we people back there no in his thinking do you get the difference of what that you can sit there and think about something that is not even a part of you and will never transpire right right but there's no way God could think of anything that it's not transpiring come on is that what the prophet said it he said he can't have a new thought you see in his mind so I don't want to be just what he thought of the only way that you can have eternal life is to not just be what God thought of but to be a part of the god that done the thinking do you understand me how could you get eternal life without Jesus Christ giving it unto us well it always was eternal brother you just don't understand now you went too far yeah it will let me brother Dale better you better be careful called Satan wants to be God yeah and that's what he's giving the people the idea to try to be God in the wrong way but aren't you careful because you might be Satan might be dealing with you don't worry about it he's dealing with me all the time that's no problem to tell you that he deals with me all the time and I'm going to tell you that you're just a liar when you say don't deal with you no problem because I know what he does to the human being but if I can follow the channel of God what is it to one thing brought around said Satan can't do I know he can't be the Holy Ghost that's but what is the one thing run around said Satan can't do it okay we can't create that's another what's the other the main thing he says Satan can't do he can't put the word together but he'll stop somewhere every time make these stones in the bread he cannot put the word together well how do we find a predestinated gift one of these days I'll have to get into that anyway so don't worry about it what is a predestinated gift that's predestinated eternally how do you keep up with a prophet to decide whether he's a prophet or not all right how do you keep up with a true fault Ministry right but what they can do with the word they can keep that word together you better listen well I don't like you do that because you get into your own self listen don't you worry about yourself you just worry about whether I'm telling you the truth or not because a dumb donkey can tell you the truth I can die and go to hell but you know the way I feel now I can be so happy because I've been able to preach 40 something years about God and his ways and his doings and showing how that he's the Eternal God and bringing it down through and showing it to the correct order they don't have to deny any quote the prophet bro or any Scripture over that 40 something years I've probably put every scripture ever quote together somewhere I didn't mean that as me it's not me we better get away from these things that we think we are remember it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves if we are anything whatsoever God made us that amen it's not my choosing you want to swap places sometimes with me get into a place that I can't even pray you ain't never been that away that you really couldn't even pray all you can do is just say Lord I just give it all to you you'll take care of it because I can't do it anyway but we wouldn't spirits we were just in his thinking in his thinking to really be in his thinking in the correct way then we have to be a part of him now we know then the only thing that's a part of him is eternal life now what we what we got to decide is one thing you say decide well that's come on that's where I'm laying it down that hard to make it where you got to decide one thing you got to decide that the prophet and the Bible is right mm-hmm okay amen r people with their own ideas about what they're doing is right so it's left up to you whether you got the holy ghost or not right how are you going to check me come on I've been at this 40 years I ain't worried about it you got to check me by the word you can't check me by how good feelings I am or how nice a guy I am Jesus didn't seem too good when that lady sure was pleading on him and he said well you're nothing but a dog we don't give the children's bread to dogs I mean was he smiling you don't you don't understand sweetheart no he spoke plain straight because that's the best way to do it but in his thinking and to think about that he never had a new thought so if he never had a new thought the thoughts of God are eternal right is that somewhere in church age that we gave to you about three or four times so then we have to be the only way we can be in this thinking correctly is to be a part of him why wouldn't we want it that away why would we not want to depend upon him for everything and realize the breath we breathe the food we eat who is it um Jackson which one was it Stonewall Jackson said that he never even took a drink of water without thanking God for it we ought to do that every breath we take everything we get he's given us and then we don't want to depend on him to be what he wants to be as our savior Our Father our healer what about it God is the only thing that's eternal pull that one up number four five identifications of the true church 1960 9 11 evening service God is the only thing that's Eternal therefore we are part of God by receiving his life Jesus said I give unto them eternal life the Greek word there is Zoe means God's own life the only way that you can ever live again is to have eternal life which is God's life because your life will perish but his life will be raised up again because God is eternal you and you've got eternal life and can no more die than God can die oh he that believeth on me have eternal life and I'll raise him up eternal life number five water baptism 1961. 119 a that's the reason we can't die right down at the bottom because we're a part of God offsprings of his sons and daughters we got eternal life God's life it never did begin never will end right paradox 64. God in the beginning is the word now if you listen to this quote you'll realize one scripture and that's one back over in the name that I wanted to bring out but you remember when he comes riding back on a white horse he has a name written and what does it say which is the word of God he has a name written God in the beginning is the word he always was the word and the word is a thought that's expressed see now in his thinking what he had the whole plan knowing to end from the beginning he has just expressed it in words and those words are manifested what about it sir as we would see Jesus 64. paragraph 13 14. now if you were in his thinking at the beginning if you got eternal life there is only one form of eternal life eternal life had no beginning and it has no ending so if you have eternal life you were an attribute of God's thinking before there was anything but him attribute of his thinking Judas is carrot was a natural thought of his thinking but he was not an attribute of God we've been through that a lot now I hope you you might have to go back and listen a little attributes of his thinking now I'm not talking about attributes of his thinking like Judas is just a thought I'm talking about attributes of being a part of the Thinker right you were an attribute of God's thinking before there was anything but him your form your shape and what you're in now is just a negative when you come up to around 20 22 years old you were a negative and death develops a picture to the positive yeah all right look how he places it as he's thinking of what would take place here and watch the seed then is this thought is this quote has been read you say a seed remember Gene come on you were not a seed in your great in your great granddaddy you had to be only from your daddy but in your great-granddaddy you could not be a seed you were a gene and even in your daddy when he was born you were just a gene and then somewhere in his 20s when he got married and you understand now you can talk about a germ or a gene or a seed we were a gene in God we had that this past Sunday it wasn't a germ or a word or a seed or whatever as being literal things we were a gene in his thinking look what he says here because this covers time I love this when their eyes were opened they knew him 64. as I said last evening God has lauded that his scripture from the beginning before there was any time when he was eternal he all he is the Eternal one and these things that's happening now are only the attributes of God's thinking at first it has to be a thought and then a word and a word when a thought expressed is a word and then it's spoken it has to happen and the whole thing is God unfolding himself in his attributes then God being made manifest tangible tangible that we can talk to speak with his whole church body and everything Therefore your name was in his thinking that's how you have eternal life you can't have it no other way now you're reading off the screen you can't have it no other way only to be what your name was in his thinking what you can't have it no other way if you've got eternal life you always was what about what always would and if you otherwise you can't say well say well what about it there's a vast difference in being what he thought of into being a part of him if you want to deal with predestination I still don't want to just be a point that would think about predetermining I'd still rather be part of the one that done the predetermining you know because that way I don't I can't fail because he could predestinate me to fall but if I'm a part of him sister Gayle how can I fall now then we know it's not Body Spirit and soul of a human being the only part that always was eternal in his own life amen and having that life coming in you and I you always was Eugene is thinking let's just quit Tara cousin got a bunch more quotes but let me just talk a minute eternal life to me means more than anything in the world because it means whether or not I live because we don't believe in eternal hell right so if you don't believe in eternal hell uh there is no other eternal life beside the life of almighty God and why wouldn't we want to believe and teach our children what if your children sets in a church that's all they hear is we always was eternal you don't need to be saved you always was eternal you always was eternal everything you always was eternal well they're not going to seek God right you see why I apologize to a man one time for what I've taught in his church that he didn't believe I told him I said I will not apologize for what I was saying I apologize for the fact that you don't believe it and I said in your church I said I want to be right see and I just I said I'm sorry and I said something I caught you I thought you believed in eternal life and I said I'll never apologize for getting your people to seek God yes but no man sought the Lord he'll run me down one of these days well he might run you over too what do we think about in his thinking didn't even get into the quote parts of it but in his thinking then if there's any part of me whatsoever that tries to think about how great I am I realized that I was lost I realized that I was doomed and on the way to hell God crossed my path when I was about 11 years old I told you about that 'd give most people a joyous thought so that eternal life found you right back there I never did believe that gave me eternal life and even when I heard the prophet and him explaining it he was explaining to God I saw but he didn't tell me that to just believe that I was eternal and for two years I sought God for the baptism of the Holy Ghost until I had a satisfaction of knowing what eternal life is I never thought that I always was eternal never have had no thoughts there's only one part of this man that you're looking at that's Eternal and that's the soul that God has given eternal life to him but that eternal life is a part of God and that didn't make it we'll get on it Sunday that didn't make me an eternal son there is no such thing as an eternal son a Son of God is eternal by the new birth but there's no such thing as a Son of God as an eternal Son of God you see why I try my best to hold salvation before you to get you to seek God until you come through with an experience that you can be assured of where you're standing believe in Jesus Christ come to live into your heart and your life by the new birth then that eternal life always was eternal amen there was a day that you and I never existed as people if you're following what I say and what I've talked to you so far in a couple of likes a couple of messages that we've got back up into the mind of God the only thing that can be in the mind of God is a part of God that's eternal life a part of God manifested in a human being a child of God a son and daughter of a living God just like you are The Offspring of your mom and dad you are them on display in another form we as the Bride of Jesus Christ we're God on display in another form called a bride no Eternal sonships to it but an eternal godship you said brother Dale do you really believe that we are God made manifest in human flesh will you explain what you are Sunday morning you got to service men women children who you want you can explain what you are but see I can't explain anything but what this word says this word says I was lost Paul said such were some of you we were lost God crossed our faith made contact with us brother moat used to call it a little tug on your heart it was a good talk God just reaches down and touches you amen can you have eternal life brother Dale and doubt it may I quote right around him his daughter-in-law Lois received the Holy Ghost one night to read the message you'll find it the next night or two she was doubting whether she was saved or not Satan can come in and make you think a lot of things but just keep quoting the word to him Stan come on brothers in God's thinking or in the mind of God or whatever just to be a part of God displayed in the human vessel but one day you say well what are we going to be in heaven I'm glad you thought of that what are we going to be in heaven is it going to do away with God and it's just the people running around not quite not quite because you see I'd love today to have my father sitting here listening to me preach because he's my father like I told a man at work one time he was talking about how bad his daddy was I said yeah but just remember one thing he brought you into the world no matter what you think about him brother Donnie knows this is true we were talking one day and he's talking about his dad and how sometimes he was pretty tough you know boxing with him and you know I said but brother Donnie he brought you into the world and he made you a man to not be pushed around he made you straight and firm might not have been a good daddy as we think but if nothing else he brought you into the world you know it's what I think about kids now they say you brought me into the world you're responsible well let's just take them out no no not that far now they only want you to raise them in responsibility and give them everything as you see folks I never knew my daddy never got to see a medium as far as human beings I can remember vague things but you know as I told you Sunday about what would you do if somebody offered you a million dollars to change your birth certificate over and come somebody else I'll never change from being a Dale I don't care what because my daddy was a Dale he said well how do you know well even if I wouldn't that was the guy that was put forth as being my daddy and I loved him for that your daddy and they've been in mean as a rattlesnake but he brought you into the world because you see I'm talking about my heavenly father my father that give me part of his own life that I could be his child now I'm going to stay at this way and then we'll stop on it see I don't believe in eternal sonship but I believe a child of God that has eternal life is just as Eternal as his father so you can say I'm an eternal child that's good that gives ring to a lot of things to be an eternal child what we got brother 6 12 in spiral book as a dear parents foreign you you were like that you haven't eaten he's coming let's see two words oh my friend and you are my brother even though you are my king I want you more than any other so much more than anything else baby not eating good so let's just believe in everything will be all right

desire alone they might not have been a good mom and a dad but I have a father you say well what about a mother yeah my mother is the word all I need is my father to connect with my mother and make
