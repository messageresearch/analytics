TRANSCRIPT
========================================
good we had a good time this facility to have it at all right second Peter chapter one you missed the chicken up well you can go back and sit down and play with the Flies and we'll go out there to the Guilford park or they it's not anything that was nice yeah that was good yeah not cotton flies if I mean it would have been nice if you brought the vehicle to have the hayride oh well yeah that's true we'll do that more in the um oh yeah this thing won't stay on but a couple of seconds get him John praise the Lord okay second Peter chapter one like what we were talking about last night in the Bible study which was a wonderful setting outside around the campfire that was good II Peter chapter one there had to be somebody come to a position that they could tell us how to have faith how to have virtue how to have knowledge how to have Temperance and what better person than Peter who had a problem with all that right when Jesus was here but then what about a great where uh Peter says I was on the mountain with the Lord I Saw the Transfiguration I saw this I walked with the Lord I walked here I did this but now I have a more sure word of Prophecy because it wasn't just Jesus talking to him anymore it was Jesus inside of him talking out but we believe the Holy Ghost is inside of us speaking out right not just Jesus somewhere we know there's a physical Jesus somewhere but he said I'll send back the comforter right in my father's name that's right this is the god this is the god this could be a god India there's three million Gods all right g-o-d-s that's just a title that's just a an object of worship so what was the father's name Jesus there was no other name God ever had said Jesus Christ all right or you got two Gods that's right so we see that Peter came up and said now I have a more sure word of Prophecy in other words it wasn't second-hand information that's what we're dealing with now we're not dealing with second-hand information sure we have to get it from a minister we have to get it from from each other but it's gone doing this feeling if Paul says we must have the mind of Christ and he was lying if we didn't that's right and we know he wasn't lying because it's in the holy word and it's Eternal so we are in the positive Mind Of God Paul says we have the mind of Christ you say we're going to have he said we have the mind of God all right so to have the minds of Christ is to have Christ speaking out right remind me of that I postponed that for a minute but now we're looking at the Statue of a perfect man and our title is lend me a sermon because that's what that is so now Peter with the Holy Ghost he didn't take out a physical sword like he did and cut the ear off of the man he's taking a spiritual sword and doing the work right right he says now we're going to take the the sword of the word and I'm going to teach you how to become because what all the things Peter went through all the adversity Peter went through but on the day of Pentecost who was the first man that walked out the door and said hey this is that that one 30-minute sermon converted 3 000 people and filled them with a Holy Ghost now I didn't fill them with a holy ghost like Peter had it because Peter had walked with God himself for three and a half years and God had was sitting there teaching them these virtues they were watching what Jesus was doing right because he was the he's the very stature of a perfect man the only perfect man there ever was that's great but you know what he didn't stay the only perfect man because remember he wants Stones just like him what would a father a father wants a son to be just like him all right so he wants us to be like him so he gave us the ability through the Holy Ghost not an anointing not something that just comes by an anoints you every once in a while but a feeling so where when you walk down the road that's God walking down the road we got to get to that point like Daddy said last night we got to get to the point to where God's not over under somewhere even Moses said that Moses said God's Not Over the state God's not over here where you gotta no he's neither even in thy mouth the word of faith we preach right all right so that's what we're doing now is yeah you got to hear it from a preacher because the Bible says in Ephesians right the Apostle prophets passive teachers in evangelists to perfect the Saints so you got to hear it through a five-fold Ministry a Ministry of five different officers some in teaching some in preaching some in evangelism missionary work through those five offices God speaks to us but you know what we have to do we have to take that what's inside of us and agree with it or disagree okay so it works both ways it doesn't work just God's Gonna Get No it works both ways because remember Pete uh Paul and James are not fighting each other as far as works and faith your works is your faith expressed that's right okay so you got to have faith gotta have faith down here at the bottom you gotta have faith big wide Foundation Faith covers a lot of things and that's what we're going to read today we're going to read in a second Peter and then we're going to turn over to Hebrews 11. so let's read second Peter and just get a basis of what's going on here and then we'll read a few quotes from The Prophet second Peter chapter one Simon Peter a servant an impossible Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious faith all right so he's not talking to the center he's not talking to the world he's not talking to the president of the United States he's talking to you if you're born again if you have obtained this same faith that he has he's talking to you okay all right excuse me light precious Faith with us through the righteousness not Peter's righteousness not yours but through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ all right Grace and peace be multiplied unto you look at all these multiplied and abound Peter's telling him said hey man if you get what I got you're just going to overflow because remember what I said about Peter Peter goes to the gate beautiful he does not have enough money to pay for that lame man to go to the doctor I was telling him last weekend and brother brother brothers he went he went after the guy and got he went I'm poor fisherman I ain't got no money I ain't got a dollar to give you watch what he said Peter said Silver and Gold Have I know in other words I don't have the ability to pay for you to go to the doctor but such as I have he didn't have to go get it he didn't have to go pray for it he didn't have to go ask the priest for it he had it such as I have give out of Thee Well what is that that's virtue that strength that man Drew strength from what Peter was saying and Peter had it already he had faith in what he spoke would happen now that's the way you and I are gonna have to be that's right not like popping popcorn we're not going to go out and like say every time you walk by somebody they're gonna get healed but you know what these people that were in that time the Bible says they would walk down the street in the lane that was sitting beside the road when the shadow passed them right that wasn't the shadow it wasn't the shadow that healed them it was the faith they had in the people walking by because they saw virtue they saw knowledge they saw temperatures in other words they were able to draw off of what those people already had not what they were going to get what they already had all right so Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and Jesus our lord according as his divine power I like that word divine there's not a lot of things Divine on this Earth they may call it Divine this and divine that there's nothing Divine on this earth right except me and you if we're born again we get the divine nature of God then your makes hmm well I don't think we're close enough yet according as his divine power hath given unto us a gift given unto us all things that pertaineth unto life and godliness so this is life lessons and how to be like God okay through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue so he's called us to something all right whereby are given now given that's a gift he like in other words he said in the book of Acts it says repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the mission of your sin and ye shall receive the what gift of the Holy Ghost called the promises to you and your children them to the far off mean which means we want our guys are called but you got to remember it says repent and then be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ all right for the remission you're sin and then you shall receive the gift so there's a process there but watch watch Peter saying whereby are given unto us exceeding see there's another adjective this the same God's going to give you this stuff and he's not just going to give it to you in a little bitty teacup measure we got to come to the stature of the fullness of Christ the man walking with all the virtues in their life he's a statue of God walking on the earth whereby have given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers all right uh for taking something we're going to be partakers of the divine nature of God all right having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this see you got to have all that before you get this and besides this in other words I've told you what to get get born again get the new birth be born again have the faith of God for what you need at your level of understanding have the faith of God and then besides that add to your faith see see this is this is not one two three four five six seven eight ads in the Bible there's only seven add to your faith well this is your faith go and give me the Holy Ghost just mine brother Roger it's not it's not his anymore it's mine you give it to me so it's mine he's on any Giver he don't want it back he wants to give it more than you want it actually so have faith and add to your faith one two three four five six seven answer your faith all right are you seeing this word says holy spirit that's not the new birth right there you say oh wow oh wait a minute Paul says I Die daily right this man we call Peter says being born again look that word being up ongoing process that's right sure you have one major birth that cleans you out gets rid of the old nature but then God wants to completely fill you and he just keeps filling we can't stand it as humans so he does he knows that so he's not going to give it all to us at one time right we get it in stages just like that baby we talk about the baby that baby over there she's got every faculty she needs little Jonas has got every faculty he needs to drive a car he's not gonna gain any new parts to be able to drive a car but now you're going to let him drive a car no one he hasn't come to the knowledge of being able or mature enough but he's got everything he needs he's a human he's got a body of spirit and soul he's got everything he needs he can go out there and get in the car and sit down hold on to the standpoint but he's not fully developed that's the same way with you and I we're not a fully developed Christian you just begin your journey when you're born again that's just when God starts really dealing with you and really wanting to use you remember the Bible says God won't dwell in an unclean vessel so at least I'm going to use something that's not clean but once it's clean he can start filling the jar up and turning it on reminding me I'm keep posting on that I know you said too so thank you I saw you raise your hand all right so does anybody have any questions with that we've got to start besides this Peter says besides all this besides all verse 1 through 4. you escape the corruption of the world through us should we sure we still have problems we still have everyday life that we got to deal with but besides this or five and besides this giving all diligence that means it's not going to just be given to you just because you wake up in the morning in your life no you gotta let me see if I can remember the scripture the scripture says the kingdom of God is taken by force when Joshua went into the Promised Land the malachites and all those ice didn't just move back and say oh Joshua no he fought for every inch of ground so even typing the new birth going over into the promised land as Joshua took the promised land there was still ice in there television Heights and all these hikes that we got now all these things that we put in front of God you put every ice you want to hunting knives fishing nights late ice at least we have an example okay but you see what I'm talking about Joshua when he went into Promised Land that's what he had to do he had to fight for that ground and then when he got into the land and fought the ground pushed the people back then he took his people and what'd he do he positionally placed them where they needed to go speaking of another layer or another work of the Holy Ghost which is adoption adoption is placing you where you need to go he was able to put down an Ephraim and all the ones where they needed to go all right but there was still in the land he had to fight for it so you and I he that overcometh they don't say he just shows up all right this is not a it's not just he that shows up right he didn't overcome it all the things we need in the Bible to to defeat Satan it's not something you take to a picnic you take forks and spoons and knives to a picnic we're going to a battle swords word Shield helmet of righteousness all these things all right so it's a battle and that's what this is this is my brother Keith read always says these are life lessons these are things that we learn in life and that's why that Peter came to this position and he said besides this giving all diligence add to your faith see you made it personal he said don't add it God's faith God already got faith God is Faith that's right he's just wanting you to have faith in him right all right but when he gives you something it's a gift add to your faith in other words listen add to what you believe virtue that's right add to what you believe knowledge Right add to what you believe Temperance all right you got it what you believe if you don't believe you got it you can't ever have it how you gonna get something you can't believe him you gotta believe he that believeth unto right believe it that th has got a lot of meaning to it because it's an ongoing process that's right all right add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge into knowledge temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and the godliness brother with kindness and brotherly kindness charity not like this verse 8 for if these things be on you oh what they say in you not on you there's a difference that's right the devil can anoint you yes come on the devil can anoint you because he was the anointed cherub yeah that anointing didn't come off of him he still got that anointing he's going to be destroyed one day but he's not one of these he's not a drunk and a thief and a I don't know let's just be playing right he's sitting in this building today that's right he came with you amen but hopefully not in you but he came around you he's right here he's here you just think just think in your human mind for a few minutes he's here that's right but you got to remember this rightly divides the Bible says the word of Truth so you know what's truth and what's error okay and this Faith virtue and all these different patience is drawing you closer to God and further away from him that's right amen because there's people that you want to be around in the world really honestly there's people like businessmen that I like to draw virtue from that may not even be born again but I draw strength of being able to handle finances or do things right or do you know do the right thing but now as far as my salvation I know where to separate that that man's not giving me salvation just because he's helping me with my finances that's right no that's just life lesson that's right but I know where to come on Sunday and on Wednesday to get the real life lesson then I can put the ones together that's right right that's right I mean you know we don't just we don't just haphazardly go through life there's a there's a way to do this because it says right here he says according his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertains into life and godliness he's given to us but now remember somebody gives you a gift you gotta take it or you can reject it that's right I mean somebody gives you a gift you can say no I don't know right but if you receive it like this tree said then you open these yours so whatever's in there is yours so God's give us a gift he said here if you want this gift is here open it if you want to because remember God is not going to go over your free moral agency that's right Now look for if these things be in you and abound not just be in you but abound I mean heaping abound means that you when you get a bountiful crop that don't mean you get four potatoes you get four thousand potatoes that's a bountiful crop if these things being you and abound they make you now I like that word make because you know what it's just like me making my kids do something if they've done all this it'll make you do this it'll make you be this kind of a person it'll make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ so there as we go through life take these life lessons and all the things that we're doing in life if you take that you take that with you you will neither be Barren or in fruitful not only just in finances not only just in being a good person but oh we're talking about a like I've always come out last night we have come to a place to where we can be the full stature of God has not been anywhere other any other time the full stature of God it's a requirement in this age to do that my Bible says for Darren that it's a big yes absolutely right because what is a what is a what is a Barren tree it's an idle tree it's a tree that that designs it's just not do anything right so that's the barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these things is blind now if you look that word up blind it's gross Darkness that's not just blind physically you can be blind physically and and be enlightened spiritually but if you're blind spiritually I don't care if you got 20 20 Vision or 10 10 vision sorry and cannot see afar off in other words Revelation far off and have forgotten have we forgotten now this is written to Christians people this is not written to the world remember this is right the Christians because I wrote my Bible still talking to Christian because Peter hadn't forgot his thought he kept his thought going all the way through it's the one that had light pressure faith and the ones that are in the body of Christ don't fall into gross Darkness you say can I yeah you can do that you can blind yourself from the rest of the word you can right if you're idle or Idol either one or idle but if your idle you've got an idol serious okay everybody understand that if you're on dle you got an idol if you're I know you've got an idol that you're worth something you're worshiping besides God right that was good I had forgotten yeah sometimes we forget where we come from yeah come on people yeah we forgot where God brought us too yeah it is right our friend yes all right yeah and that forgotten that he has that he was purged from his old sin sometimes we forget that we gotta that's why it says being born again wow pulses I Die daily well Paul didn't die going to great no he meant the old nature man had to die now he was a prophet a guy that wrote the word of God that God wrote the word through right and he still had to die how much more you enough okay Bob leaving said Jesus learned about the things he suffered and being made perfect being made perfect all right verse 10 we're about wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence there's that word again look how much Peter is pressing he's pressing you've got to do this give diligence to make your calling and elections sure and I wrote a promise in my Bible right here for if you do these things you shall never fall if you do these things want the prescription of the doctors give you you do these things Dr Peter said if you do all these and I tell you to do you'll never fall that's what the Bible says you'll never fall if you'll do these things but don't start complaining if God don't fulfill this and we haven't got those the virtues because Peter says after all this if you'll do this prescription make it just like I said take this pill every day like this certain virtue every day knowledge every day Temperance every day learn from God every day then you shall never fall but our problem is is we don't do the total prescription and somewhere in the line will be fall but that's okay that's why this thing called Grace my grace is sufficient Jesus is gracious and efficient but now if we keep doing the same thing over and over and over again and five years later we're still doing the same thing you ain't got that's not dead yet you're just putting it over in a closet until you need it again then you open the door and pull it back out but if it's dead it's gone we don't believe in the resurrection of old junk we believe in Resurrection and units of Life That's What scripture says we plant them in corruption we raise them in incorruption all right so we're gonna plant this all these dead Nature's Natures that we got right that's what we got to do we got to plant we got to bury them not to be brought back again that's why I love when God told Moses said Moses tell these people this that if you walk out in that water you put the stick down Red Sea Park when you get across there you tell them that those Egyptians that they saw today they will never see no more now that makes me feel good that's good but now what did the people do they did exactly what Moses told them so when Moses got on the other side and the water come together and killed all those Egyptians which is the type of the things that we need to get rid of coming out of Egypt come out over my people Revelations 19. come out of her what the old system her church same thing with Moses he was bringing his people God's people out of the world into the Promised Land and he said those Egyptians you see this day that you saw this day you'll never see them again their dad we've had people go and pass on we're not going to see them again until the resurrection but that's just that's just an example but you know you don't go put somebody in the ground in two days later you see them again no it's almost dead it's dead that's right same thing with our own nature when it's dead it's dead and you'll know it's dead you know why because you don't see it no more oh he may come and and try to bring it to you remember the devil he's a master at this so if he can't get you this way he's just going to take and go right around the mountain and come in from the back side so be careful just keep that Shield up and make sure that when he does come powerful scripture says resist the devil and he'll flee from you that's pretty powerful but it's a very small scripture and we sometimes don't use it now let's go to Hebrews 11 we're going to start now talk on faith I'm going to read this quote here though we read it again from the statue of a perfect man in 1962 while you're turning Hebrews 11 1. brother Brian said that's the way it is with Christ you've got to be so in love with him because when we ask for something and he doesn't give it to us that doesn't shake us a bit remember I've always said God's nose are the best yeses you'll ever get because if he says yes he knows you the end from the beginning right so if he says yes then you're pretty much okay if he says no Then you know to forget going down that path if your son and daughter of God if he says no it's for your good all right and the only way we can do that the only way look the only thing is because a baby will go what why why why why why why why why why daddy why mama why why why why why why why why why why why you hear it remember and I said so means a lot but that's what God said he said I said so last one that's why we always say we said so but if you really sat down and broke it down and explained it to the kid which is not going to understand at that point but later on they will sit down and explain to him why I've always wanted somebody to explain to me the why if I'm doing something wrong don't just say you're wrong but now I want somebody to explain to me why I'm doing it wrong because you know what I may do it again but if you explain to me that it's wrong I don't know what the wrong is and I'll quit doing it now that's what he done that's what God's done every Sunday every Wednesday that's what he's doing that's right he's telling us you're wrong and this is where you're wrong and this is how to correct it that's right what a loving father that's what he's doing because we've got the wrong nature aren't we we got the wrong thinking the wrong we were born wrong remember born anti-word we weren't supposed to come this way all right we're supposed to be smoking seed children with God not not coming from the laundry of a man and the only way we can do that is to become partakers of this divine nature then you'll understand the reason he can't give it to you see you'll understand in other words he'll explain he's already explained what you doing wrong this is why and then he brings a preacher or teacher or a or or a brother or sister in the Lord to kind of just get beside of you and say hey this is kind of why that this is my experience and and this is what the Lord showed me because that's what a preacher's doing you're pulling on this gift and she has so many and I'm going to say this and I'm going to say I say after the till the day we get out of here preachers should be servants some leaders should be servants not I I mean me no we're there to serve you and if you want something out of a service have a need that's right you have a need and a want that's fine but you bring that knee before God and I'll guarantee you he'll put a preacher In a Pulpit how many times have we done something down here and me not finish it and daddy finish it upstairs and me and Dad don't talk about Services together because I don't want to pull him away from this and he don't want to pull me away from there so we don't talk about what we're going to create but many times and that's that's that's to me the virtues being shown working in Yemen because you did it I didn't do it I'm not saying I did it no no no no you did it you had that thought in your mind here heading upstairs and then when you got up there and sat down daddy may not have been gonna say that 10 minutes of what we talked about down here but God brings him right over because you do that you do it he doesn't do it and I don't do it same thing happens in the Bible study oh absolutely no doubt yeah and Bible stays the same way so that's why we that's why Peter says we can be partakers of this divine nature because you know what if you're born again and I'm born again good degree we have the same nature should be a Godly nature now we all I like hunting and fishing and don't care a thing about cars and Donnie here's caught by cars don't care anything about fishing that don't mean that's just human nature Human Nature but see we agree on the word and we and we're not conflicting when it comes to the word so see we can we can we can he can pull from in I can pull from him same way with hearing and I'm I'm going to say it again we're serving there's no great ones Among Us I love bird quality always mention that and that's true there's no great preachers great congregations make great preachers right it's true great congregations make great preachers you know brother Brown you know what he said he said if the will of the people was that the preacher preached a Trinity right then that's what the preacher preaches right right well I believe I'm not preaching the Trinity no such thing tomorrow but that's the will of the people that's true so we're nothing but just that we're just we're just a conduit to where I can spark something God says hey Brother Ray needs something but I'm not going to speak directly to Brother Ray because he may not know it's me now I'm I'm just being Carnival with this he may not know it's me okay but if you put a preacher up there let's preached what's on your mind all week and you haven't talked to the preacher now you got to believe that the preacher caught the spirit from God that's right right amen and then that's what was brought so he's just a conduit God's wanting to bring you something and he says okay I'm going to bring it right through here and how much more do you rejoice same way here when we Rejoice here when we go upstairs and I don't finish a statement or somebody has a question in your mind and you don't even ask me the question you you said why would you cover that better I have a question about that go right upstairs and daddy covers the whole thing that's up to me this morning through his sister the problem I had last night about believing about that and she said Okay figure that you know the day of the Rapture so we're all standing in line and that my name is called and I said oh but I can't go because I'm not you yeah sure hey this is not just for the men now for what happened in the Garden of Eden will not go back to all that but we know that Eve fell from the word of God by believing Satan's life right so a woman cannot preach but now before that man and woman was equal but the double Covenant was the second Covenant that came in God said no from now on you'll be under headship you'll be under your husband and because of what you did and listened to the serpent because what you did you can't preach anymore now you say brother that ain't in the Bible no it's all the way through the Bible that's right that's good woman yeah and let me just be playing with this I want to explain something that was somebody asked brother Jim Pinkston said well well why can't a woman pray and he said well the Bible full from being a man being subject to the wife because of what happened in the garden she can teach and she can teach the Sunday school class and she can be a help just like the sister was there but not a conduit from God because of the double Covenant the man's here the woman's here that's just the way it is now we're going to be restored back when we get over there all right okay but but if you want to go to the levitical priesthood when you take the Levites when you take a female in the Old Testament they couldn't enter the temple for the seven day period of their uncleanness that you women understand what I'm talking about the seven year period that you have every month you couldn't go in a congregation because you were unclean now that's a Time and that's what that's what brother Payson said well what is your what is your preacher do so what does she do you know brother Jim he just big mouth like me he said what is your Pastor Dave when she has that time of the Mind said the Bible says she ain't supposed to be in church yeah he's a lawyer but I don't know how we got on that but but look it's headship though Christ is our head that's right and then we're supposed to be in the body we're supposed to hear from him but then God give us a Ministry to give it to you and then you have a part in this where like I said we're not the great one we're servants we serve song leader you're supposed to serve you're supposed to serve what the people won't know what you want right you're supposed to feel the leading of the Lord and do what the Lord leads and we'll do that we'll have a better time with it let's read Hebrews 11 and then we're going to give you this point and then we'll go chapter 11 Hebrews 11 verse 1. now Faith is the substance that word substance means actual existence all right so now Faith is the actual existence of things hoped for the fish can't have fins and swim in the water unless there's water it's got to be water there right you can't have a desire for a steak if there's no such thing as a steak same thing as far as far as our desires there's got to be a substance there so the substance is the Holy Ghost to me that's the most important thing is the Holy Ghost get the Holy Ghost and you'll you'll either it says it is the earnest of your inheritance like I said with the ocean Ocean's full of 90 different elements if you take one little speck one drop of water from the ocean and put it on this table you've got the same 90 elements as the water in the ocean if that is the water in the ocean that's not a substitute that is the substance right but there's a whole ocean of water out there but to have a substance of the ocean then you have the ocean right you have the ocean if you've got those 90 elements so if you've got the Holy Ghost you've got everything God wants to give you but what happens our flus get stopped up that's right we stop God you say stop God yes sir you will yes ma'am you will you will stop God how many have ever stopped God oh 100 okay all right just want to make sure I was on the right track here now Faith is the substance of things hold for the evidence of things how many have you seen Jesus in flesh literally in his Corporal body hold your shin out there just a little bit further literally in flesh how many of you seen Jesus how many have you seen Donald Trump so what we got to do we gotta have faith that's right that there was a Jesus yes and then you did die on a cross we never saw it physically that's right so faith is the substance but we know what happened because the substance is there we can believe that that's right he did it he died in the mind of God before the foundation of the world the Bible said but he had to literally bring that to pass on the earth so we could believe things that we don't see but is it a substance absolutely absolutely if he didn't die on that cross and if he wasn't here 2000 years ago we're just yakking our lips off for no reason at all but we got to believe that that's who he was and that he said what he's going to do Were You There When I wrote this nope but we're living it right now and we do see God in human flesh now but he's in our flesh all right let's go Faith remember talk about faith next Sunday
