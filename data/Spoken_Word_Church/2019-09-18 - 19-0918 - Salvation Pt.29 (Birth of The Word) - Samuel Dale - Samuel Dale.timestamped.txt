[4:47] then 1st Peter because we've been on
[4:51] this for quite a while 1st Peter 1:22
[4:57] seeing you have purified your souls in
[5:00] obeying the truth through the spirit
[5:01] under unfailing love of the Brethren see
[5:04] that you love one another with a pure
[5:06] heart fervently being born again not of
[5:09] corruptible seed but of incorruptible by
[5:11] the Word of God which liveth and abideth
[5:14] forever now how are you born
[5:17] you're born by the incorruptible or the
[5:22] word that is made alive is that a better
[5:26] way of saying it the word that is made
[5:29] alive is your new word now let's go to
[5:32] 2nd Peter all right Simon Peter servant
[5:37] and apostle of Jesus Christ to them that
[5:39] have obtained like precious faith with
[5:40] us through the righteousness of God and
[5:43] our Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace
[5:45] be multiplied unto you through the
[5:47] knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord
[5:50] according to his divine power has given
[5:52] unto us all things that pertain unto
[5:55] life and godliness through the knowledge
[5:58] of him that have called us to glory
[6:00] inversor now we're all called to that
[6:02] what we will reimburse you right
[6:05] strength and eternity of all the things
[6:09] okay
[6:10] we're by giving it to us exceeding great
[6:12] and precious promises by these you might
[6:14] be partakers of the divine nature having
[6:17] escaped the corruption that is in the
[6:19] world through lust and beside this
[6:21] giving all diligence add to your faith
[6:23] virtue and to virtue or knowledge and
[6:26] the knowledge temperance and to
[6:28] temperance patience and to patience
[6:30] godliness and to godliness brotherly
[6:32] kindness and to brotherly kindness
[6:35] charity for if these things be in you
[6:38] and abound they make you that you shall
[6:39] neither be barren nor unfruitful in the
[6:42] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ you
[6:46] may be seated the Lord that is blessing
[6:48] to the reading of the word yeah keeping
[6:53] your thoughts in mind of what we've been
[6:55] trying to bring out I wanted to kind of
[6:59] take each virtue tonight ahead that
[7:01] planned but it never did work out so you
[7:06] know you're looking at things and you
[7:09] say well I'll bring this out well
[7:11] sometimes you don't get to bring out
[7:13] what you want to bring out so I hope
[7:15] it's God doing it and not me changing to
[7:18] myself but I wanted to and we'll try the
[7:21] Lord willing to do that maybe you know
[7:24] this coming Sunday and get everything in
[7:27] order for Ken but I want to talk to you
[7:31] about something that I want you to
[7:33] notice I'll try to make little points
[7:35] then they're valuable to me now they may
[7:38] not be valuable to you you may not think
[7:40] about the things that you know that a
[7:43] minister will think of or whatever just
[7:46] like there in first Peter where it says
[7:48] being born again then he tells you how
[7:52] by the incorruptible word well right now
[7:57] the war is there any thoughts of any way
[8:01] of the new birth being anything besides
[8:04] the birth of the word you know what
[8:08] would be anything could be in relation
[8:12] to the birth of the word is just what
[8:15] the scripture says it is it's God meant
[8:17] alive in you Christ in you the hope of
[8:19] glory
[8:19] alright now keep that in mind because we
[8:23] kept hammering a little bit to our
[8:25] Sunday onto one point for you to get and
[8:28] to think about we were talking about
[8:32] that it's it talks you know it says
[8:35] there add to your faith virtue now say
[8:40] this and then repeat it and get in a
[8:42] minute
[8:42] it does not say add faith that may not
[8:49] mean a thing to you see you said well
[8:51] that's just you know it may not mean
[8:53] anything to you but see that makes me
[8:55] stop and think it says that virtue had
[8:59] temperance that patients had godliness
[9:01] right but it does not say to add faith
[9:09] why not why would it not say add faith
[9:16] see that that's you know maybe maybe
[9:20] it's just my abilities or forms you call
[9:23] it human intelligence when I look at
[9:25] something I try to look at it as to the
[9:28] point of what is being said you know to
[9:34] us and it says there in first Peter for
[9:38] us being born again well you know what
[9:42] being is being there's a process of
[9:44] something going on being born again
[9:47] alright the new birth the process of the
[9:51] new birth starts from your beginning you
[9:54] know at justification goes all the way
[9:56] through your journey to the
[9:58] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[10:00] and then the you know coming forth and
[10:03] then the pyramid coming up through and
[10:05] adoptions and all of the things and
[10:07] you're still one scripture being born
[10:11] again because that's what's taking place
[10:14] something is going on in your life
[10:18] something is going on each day in our
[10:22] lives we are being mourned again by what
[10:26] by the incorruptible word
[10:30] alright then why would we not want the
[10:33] word you know why would we not be more
[10:37] concerned that's where people have said
[10:39] it about Lula they say all they are up
[10:42] there just word word word word word will
[10:44] thank God for that
[10:46] I mean I'll say that whether you will or
[10:49] not I say thank God for the word the
[10:51] word because they Lance the word all the
[10:53] way through it was the word that started
[10:56] the world it was word before the world
[10:58] ever started it'll be the word after the
[11:02] world has ended all the things are
[11:04] through it'll still be the word well why
[11:07] wouldn't we want to think about when
[11:09] he's the word and His Christ in you Bert
[11:14] into you
[11:17] need to give you his own life okay now
[11:20] think of that thought now for just a
[11:22] little bit and we'll get back to it
[11:24] think of it why does it not say see it
[11:28] doesn't say add faith it doesn't say
[11:34] that it says add to your faith virtue
[11:41] add to your virtue knowledge now
[11:45] remember you can't jump up the ladder
[11:47] remember it's got to be vulcanized
[11:49] together right so it's all got to be the
[11:52] same material you remember that in the
[11:55] Service's previous it's all the same
[11:57] material it's all the word being
[12:00] revealed the new birth is the word being
[12:03] revealed adoption is the word being
[12:06] revealed the fields being revealed the
[12:09] the the seventy weeks are Daniel the
[12:11] things that that we have in the message
[12:13] being revealed to us
[12:18] and it's going to bring somebody to a
[12:20] change of the body alright and I want to
[12:23] be one of them don't you
[12:24] I mean that's that's the point I want to
[12:27] want us to get alright but now let see
[12:31] it says add not it don't say add faith
[12:41] put it back up where everybody can read
[12:43] if you want me to pull that back up
[12:45] brothers or the of the theater and let's
[12:47] just read verse five because I want you
[12:50] to keep that in mind that's gonna be
[12:53] valuable as we go along now watch when
[12:56] it gets to verse five and beside this
[12:58] giving all diligence add to your faith
[13:01] virtue and diverse your knowledge and a
[13:07] knowledge temperance and tell faces huh
[13:09] but it doesn't say Edie faith
[13:17] faith is not a virtue faith is a birth
[13:24] see the prophets if you remember all of
[13:27] what we talk he says you can't be born
[13:30] again without having faith that's statue
[13:33] of perfect man sitting when you're born
[13:36] again you have faith you just starting
[13:41] to a place to grow what when you get
[13:43] faith all right so then it doesn't say
[13:48] add faith they're saying what it wants
[13:54] to say because of the point that it's to
[13:57] me that God's trying to get across to us
[14:00] it starts in your new birth and you burn
[14:04] new birth this faith so you don't add
[14:08] faith
[14:10] how would you add faith what would you
[14:13] add it to well see then all the virtues
[14:16] are added to the faith right see they
[14:21] can be put on the faith and all called
[14:23] faith the Prophet said is the foundation
[14:27] of all Christianity is based upon the
[14:30] faith of God revealed to you and I all
[14:34] right but see it doesn't say where to
[14:37] add faith and it probably said have
[14:42] faith and be born again then these are
[14:47] the things that God expects us to add
[14:49] right the virtues can be added to your
[14:55] foundation but your foundations got to
[14:57] be the thing that holds you up and the
[14:58] foundation of all Christianity is faith
[15:00] in the Word of God right faith in the
[15:07] Word of God is the foundation for all
[15:09] things see then having doing that then
[15:15] see you start out at faith and you have
[15:20] faith and be born again the Prophet said
[15:26] all right so the new birth is faith now
[15:34] watch what we're getting to what was we
[15:36] talking about Sunday it's your faith
[15:46] now that is not your faithfulness that's
[15:49] the human intelligence of mankind trying
[15:52] to interpret the Word of God your
[15:55] faithfulness is not what it is that's
[15:57] just your faithfulness to believe God
[15:58] and do what God did that's not God's
[16:01] faith but see the new birth is God's
[16:07] faith revelation were revealed to you
[16:12] alright now take that as being his faith
[16:17] given to you and what did the prophets
[16:20] say that we read from Chrysler myths I
[16:22] mean from the statute of perfect man he
[16:24] said this is my eye he said God gave it
[16:29] to me he said this is my arm God gave it
[16:33] to me he said like it was with Mary
[16:39] right God gave Mary the promise that
[16:44] come all the way from genesis 3:15 that
[16:48] i'll put enmity between thy seed and the
[16:51] seed of the woman woman I'll have the
[16:53] seed so she had to be given a seed she
[16:57] was given a seed now Seth was not that
[17:01] seed he was just what would you call it
[17:04] a hundred prophets in and there was like
[17:06] a replacement but he was not that seed
[17:11] Jesus Christ is that seed when he was
[17:14] the one that was given to Mary and it
[17:18] became Mary seed
[17:21] right it became her seed because God
[17:24] give it to you the gods not an Indian
[17:28] giver so we don't count it that what he
[17:30] done that he give me you give me this
[17:32] and see don't try to add all of the
[17:34] other things as we'll get to it later
[17:36] you say well I've been in the message
[17:39] and study this message 40 years I think
[17:40] I got knowledge that's not the knowledge
[17:45] brother Brett I was talking about right
[17:50] yes well I wanted to get into each one
[17:52] of those virtues and we'll try to pick
[17:54] it up Sunday where he says now virtuous
[17:57] virtue he said now that's not trying to
[17:59] live a virgin lawful he said not in this
[18:01] case and it comes out to be an odd thing
[18:05] to wear he said and virtue is what
[18:07] strength he said and said you've got to
[18:14] have a pice to let it out we'll get to
[18:18] those things Lord with it Sunday but I
[18:21] want you to think about it
[18:23] because see it does not say add faith it
[18:33] says add to your faith see God has given
[18:39] us the new birth that is your faith
[18:43] that's not your faithfulness to do
[18:46] believe him and accept him and do this
[18:48] edit don't know all that's well and good
[18:50] with that's not the new birth the new
[18:52] birth is God coming down to giving to
[18:55] you his own very life
[19:00] placing within you his own very life but
[19:06] was he does it it becomes yours
[19:08] he's not gonna take it back that's what
[19:10] I love about it God is not going to take
[19:17] back what he gives you because he gives
[19:24] you his own life and he says add to your
[19:31] faith all right so he says how faith and
[19:39] be born again he said now that's your
[19:43] foundation but he says now this is my
[19:47] paragraph 92 of oneness this is my
[19:52] number five I want to pull it up this is
[19:56] my eye he gave me this I we don't what
[20:03] it becomes mine he's illustrating it to
[20:08] show you how much stronger it is to just
[20:10] say give me this and this is my eye
[20:12] see he takes it to Mary I'm showing Mary
[20:18] is given the seed of the woman now Eve
[20:24] wouldn't give that so don't get your
[20:26] mind into jangling no woman now what
[20:28] Mary got to do with is we're talking
[20:29] about Eva we're now that's back tire
[20:32] don't they just listen because you'll
[20:35] get your mind all jumbled up and trying
[20:37] to well how come and he using Mary the
[20:40] lorenz using Mary coat it wound it to be
[20:42] the seed of the woman which was Jesus
[20:45] Christ that was given to Mary it became
[20:49] her seed and like brother Larry comes to
[20:54] the office Sunday he said and God give
[20:56] me a seed we better get serious about
[20:59] thinking about it if he give me a seed
[21:02] it's mine
[21:06] and like I always say you know it's kind
[21:08] of carnal but this is my Bible they
[21:14] don't belong to you
[21:17] this is my Bible you may have one like
[21:21] it but it's not this Bible
[21:24] this is my Bible that God gave to me I
[21:27] thank brother Colley give it to him
[21:29] that's hurt but see it become mine so
[21:35] it's the seed of the woman the seed of
[21:38] the woman is Jesus Christ he came
[21:44] through the virgin wound to bring forth
[21:48] the product to pay for our debts and
[21:50] things like that cuz he come to Pais
[21:52] down that under you and I all right now
[21:57] watch what I'm getting at then the first
[22:01] thing is to be born again because in
[22:05] that then if you're born again don't
[22:08] worry about the virtues until you get
[22:10] born again you say well I've studied
[22:13] stats with Prairie man I think all this
[22:15] all this work on faith I work on virtue
[22:18] I work on knowledge I know you worry
[22:23] yourself to death won't get nowhere go
[22:27] the way God says it how faith and be
[22:33] born again then you can talk about
[22:38] virtue knowledge temperance patience and
[22:41] time
[22:43] but first how faith and be born again
[22:48] huh and see then when you do not watch
[22:52] what I'm talking about see he says it's
[22:59] my God gave it to me the new birth is
[23:07] yours it becomes you and God together as
[23:11] one in the new birth huh see then Paul
[23:17] said it's not I that liveth but Christ
[23:19] liveth in me and the life that I now
[23:21] live in the flesh I live by the faith of
[23:24] the Son of God God had put him his own
[23:29] life into the Apostle Paul it became
[23:34] Paul's faith
[23:41] then the ever born-again believer not
[23:47] just Mary now Mary was just a part of
[23:50] the the what you would call it the
[23:53] transmitter or the point of being used
[23:56] for the time she was just into that area
[24:00] what you see she now here's brother
[24:04] Branham we'll get back to this if you
[24:06] don't read masterpiece and see down
[24:09] there with her show you know run around
[24:11] sitting Mary's not to seat
[24:13] read the Masters didn't see what he said
[24:16] but Mary was the same he read what
[24:19] brother around him say it he said Mary
[24:24] was not the seed the seed was in Mary
[24:30] the seed was Jesus Christ now physically
[24:37] speaking Jesus Christ was in Mary right
[24:43] but spiritually speaking that never gave
[24:46] her the new birth she still had to be
[24:50] born again she was not say just because
[24:55] she could say she had within her so now
[24:58] you see one of the property said he said
[24:59] Mary is not to seed
[25:03] he said she represented Azusa Street of
[25:06] Pentecost he said they were not the seed
[25:11] they were a carrier and that's what Mary
[25:15] was she was a carrier of the natural
[25:19] life Jesus Christ was that seed see so
[25:23] she was she couldn't say I have the new
[25:27] birth but I have God within me
[25:31] that's what we say in that you know I
[25:34] mean you ask the kids and what do you
[25:36] say say words got out he's right in here
[25:38] rah see we climbed the new birth is God
[25:42] living and that's perfectly right we
[25:45] just remember Mary had to go to
[25:49] Pentecost to get the new birth the seed
[25:56] of the woman then was Jesus Christ
[26:01] do you realize then on the day of
[26:04] Pentecost
[26:05] I believe Mary was in the upper room
[26:09] right under there Pentecost there was
[26:14] not just one person there was 120 you
[26:20] know what that hundred and twenty had
[26:24] they were not just Mary carrying the
[26:28] seed see Mary then become born-again
[26:35] right but you know what 119 had the same
[26:43] thing she had right because the each one
[26:50] had the new birth come on then then each
[26:57] one could say this is my faith this is
[27:05] well as he could say it in other words
[27:07] Mary would say what I had within me was
[27:13] wonderful and great and all which they
[27:15] they even had troubles with it myself
[27:17] you remember she did she denied it and
[27:20] everything else I said I had trouble but
[27:23] said now I'm not just a carrier of the
[27:29] word
[27:31] I am now the seed itself but you know
[27:36] what
[27:36] Peter setting out to our hey sign time
[27:39] James John although same time Paul on
[27:45] the road to Damascus wooden hundred and
[27:46] twenty on the road to Damascus running
[27:48] by self when he got through what the
[27:53] hell Christ in you the hope of glory
[27:56] he had the new birth which was a
[28:00] revelation of Jesus Christ
[28:02] personally to him what did brother Adam
[28:10] say the new birth was cross the mystery
[28:13] of God revealed what'd he say he said
[28:15] the new birth is a revelation of Jesus
[28:16] Christ
[28:17] personally to you see that becomes
[28:23] something that Mary had this that could
[28:26] be brought forth from her which would be
[28:29] for everybody else but then would be for
[28:31] her to by her accepting it and I'm not
[28:34] the savior the the Christ but until she
[28:39] received that she did not have eternal
[28:42] life
[28:44] yet she had within her she had within
[28:51] her the one that would bring eternal
[28:53] loss she now know he turned a lot that's
[28:59] why this if people don't get that they
[29:01] don't listen to read around him they
[29:02] don't pay attention to the Bible I knew
[29:06] when I was in the Baptist Church that
[29:07] the Old Testament people didn't have the
[29:08] new birth then you can say well that's
[29:11] just young guys brothers they well okay
[29:13] forget it
[29:14] is it true well why does it matter who
[29:18] routed like what the lady said that
[29:23] times did you know she was hungry Nick
[29:26] some boys coming brought some food and
[29:29] set it on the porch and she come out of
[29:31] hollering and screaming praise God
[29:32] praise God for the food to praise God
[29:34] for the food
[29:35] little boys woke up and said ma'am then
[29:38] we brought that food us boys brought
[29:43] that food she said thank you Lord for
[29:45] the food and the ones that fought stick
[29:48] you know the ones that brought it thank
[29:51] you for them huh but see do you
[29:55] understand what I'm saying see they did
[29:59] not have that new birth back there
[30:01] Nicole Jesus Christ had not died see the
[30:06] seed of the woman had not been
[30:07] transmitted as well saying don't get
[30:10] tied up well will the seed of the woman
[30:12] back there in Genesis 3:16 that's that I
[30:14] see no no what I need you better get out
[30:17] of there in a hurry
[30:21] now these want to mess the whole thing
[30:24] up would you come over to Mary Mary had
[30:28] within her the seat of the woman with
[30:32] that never gave her a new birth she had
[30:36] to go to the upper room and receive
[30:39] eternal life then the seed of the woman
[30:43] was dwelling within her instead of just
[30:48] dwelling within her flesh it was in her
[30:51] soul and her being but so was it in
[30:54] every born-again believer right every
[31:02] born-again believer has that eternal
[31:05] life living in your soul which is the
[31:07] seed of the woman so why don't you say
[31:10] well Who am I I have within me the seed
[31:14] of the woman well you two thing with
[31:17] each other no no no I'm not I'm just
[31:19] being honest to tell you the truth
[31:21] that's what the Bible says that's what
[31:25] the Prophet brought to us what you see
[31:28] you don't pay attention maybe it's not
[31:31] meant to be that's all right let's see
[31:34] it means a lot when I read something and
[31:37] I read dirt as I said in the scripture
[31:39] where it says in Peter you know being
[31:41] born again by the incorruptible Word of
[31:43] God that means something to me that
[31:49] tells me how it took place that shows me
[31:53] how it would come into being and how the
[31:57] new birth would be the birth of the word
[32:00] the word that I heard
[32:04] now here's what I tried for the Sunday
[32:06] afternoon to get across
[32:09] see when you say that the Prophet says
[32:13] that the new birth is revelation of
[32:16] Jesus Christ personally you see in your
[32:19] mind will automatically transmit and
[32:21] thoughts and try to figure out things
[32:23] and you'll try to figure out what
[32:26] revelation is it that I'm supposed to
[32:32] get is it two seals it's a 70 weeks as
[32:37] it is now I'm gonna throw a rock hard
[32:41] and watch them every born-again believer
[32:46] that's the same new birth
[32:51] now you shook your head the other day
[32:54] agreeing with that for two or three
[32:55] Sundays in a row you've agreed that
[32:57] that's the birth the birth of the word
[33:01] and that everybody had the same new
[33:03] birth no matter what age there was then
[33:07] they had to sign new birth all right now
[33:11] you kind of picked up a little bit
[33:13] talking about the seed of the woman that
[33:15] believed in that ever born-again
[33:17] believer today every born-again
[33:18] believers ever been had within them that
[33:21] seed of the woman which with Jesus
[33:25] Christ the new birth right now let's see
[33:34] if you can swallow so Peter
[33:40] and Paul at the same revelation now you
[33:51] you go back and listen to Sunday
[33:53] afternoons message over again you'll see
[33:55] what I was saying Peter and Paul had the
[34:00] same revelation
[34:09] oh you say but but but Paul had a
[34:11] greater revelation the Peter saw him
[34:13] personally now I'm quoting brother
[34:16] anonymously in here okay
[34:18] Paul had more knowledge you call it Holy
[34:24] Ghost you know knowledge of the things
[34:26] because of his abilities and the points
[34:30] where he was being a prophet but Peter
[34:33] had the same revelation the Paul had so
[34:39] it's not trying to figure out well wave
[34:41] got a revelation of this and brother
[34:43] Donnie got a revelation of that
[34:44] scripture and sister got a revelation of
[34:47] this one and he's got a revelation of
[34:49] that one what is the revelation of Jesus
[34:53] Christ
[34:58] I'm asking you seriously think on it
[35:02] what is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[35:07] well he was Almighty God aren't you
[35:11] getting in good one then he was God made
[35:14] manifest inflation okay you're doing
[35:16] good keep following it don't lose that
[35:18] what I'm asking you what is the
[35:22] revelation you said well well God didn't
[35:26] reveal nothing to me the day I got born
[35:29] again
[35:36] no you mean the day you got born again
[35:39] that you never realized that you was a
[35:41] sinner and that God had come down and
[35:45] saved you come on
[35:49] no I shouted I cried figure you're still
[35:52] on that hookup I'm trying to get you off
[35:54] that hookup to get you on the straight
[35:56] line what happened when you were born
[36:01] again well I I was one person saw this
[36:05] one person see your own that you're not
[36:07] listening the new birth is the
[36:12] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[36:14] you don't you realize then that what
[36:18] happened the Bible said the goodness of
[36:20] God is what leadeth thee to repentance
[36:24] right so what would bring you to
[36:27] justification it would bring you to a
[36:35] repentance right did you not repent did
[36:41] you not cry out to God and asking him
[36:44] for to save you come on did you cuz if
[36:50] you didn't you didn't get it remember
[36:58] well the Prophet touted first you accept
[37:01] him but then if he don't accept you
[37:06] you're not saved now you need to go back
[37:10] three or four months and listen to some
[37:12] tapes you think I just drag things out
[37:15] listen you want to go back there for
[37:18] months and listen to some Tyson here
[37:22] would you do one thing favor for me
[37:27] would you go ask brother Curtin what I
[37:32] preached four or five eight ten years
[37:34] ago
[37:44] he'll tell you just what he told me this
[37:51] is the same thing you talk 10 20 years
[37:54] ago cuz he's back in our listening to
[38:00] he's had enough concern his heart to go
[38:03] back and listen then you know what his
[38:04] statement was now he don't like for me
[38:06] saying it I guess I'll just say it
[38:08] anyway he gets him in trouble I'm all
[38:11] raised in Kerrville it don't matter
[38:13] you know what he said he said why are
[38:16] some of the questions that are asked in
[38:19] the questions and answers forum steal
[38:22] the things brother they'll talk 20 years
[38:24] ago this is what he taught 20 years ago
[38:30] while you're not listening
[38:37] okay sorry brother curtain gets you in
[38:42] trouble at least I won't be by myself
[38:46] I'll have some help
[38:50] coalition Church I've been preaching the
[38:53] baptism with the Holy Ghost the new
[38:55] birth whatever revelation of Jesus
[38:57] Christ for 50 years
[38:59] you think it's war out on me to word it
[39:02] up still don't want to preach them I
[39:03] still like to preach it on a new burner
[39:05] and I don't see why anybody that would
[39:07] have the nuber wouldn't want to hear
[39:08] about the new birth I like to hear
[39:10] people talk about their their
[39:12] experiences I like to hear them tell
[39:14] about what happened but see you wouldn't
[39:17] think about it the way I think about it
[39:19] Peter is over here following the Lord
[39:23] Jesus for three and a half years goes to
[39:26] the Upper Room and the Holy Ghost Falls
[39:29] Paul meets him on the road to Damascus
[39:33] goes to the backside of the desert and
[39:36] stay just for a little piece
[39:40] and they come out with the same baptism
[39:42] when the holy go
[39:50] they both came out with a sign faith
[39:53] God's aim for one faith one Lord one
[39:55] baptism but listen you don't listen did
[40:03] you ever have an experience of where you
[40:07] realized he was a sinner and you needed
[40:11] to be saved
[40:12] have you ever had that well you know
[40:16] what that was that was God talking to
[40:19] you now if he was talking to you why
[40:25] can't you believe that what he was
[40:27] saying was the revelation of Jesus
[40:29] Christ personally to you
[40:40] when I decided I just cried I don't know
[40:42] anything about these other things
[40:43] brother they'll talk about cuz I just
[40:44] done this not just doing that and I know
[40:46] I'm saved
[40:48] do you understand what I just say it
[40:51] what is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[40:56] well he was introduced into their seat
[40:58] are you going back up sit down and
[41:01] listen what is the revelation of Jesus
[41:05] Christ
[41:05] when God began to speak to your heart to
[41:08] bringing you to salvation there is his
[41:11] revelation because he's coming to tell
[41:14] you what he's going to do he's going to
[41:17] save you that's what he's come far
[41:24] it ain't a river or less forever life
[41:26] and it over here I was looking in the
[41:28] book the other day you know I found it I
[41:30] found it right there know what is
[41:37] sanctification well you don't do this
[41:40] you quit just quit that with it
[41:42] well you know a lot about sanctification
[41:47] that's good old Baptist had a better
[41:49] understanding that it's a what is
[41:54] sanctification sanctification is an
[41:57] inward work to try to cleanse that man
[42:03] it's not an outward I quit this and I
[42:06] quit that that is not sanctification
[42:08] sanctification is not I quit drinking I
[42:10] quit you quit sanctification is the
[42:13] change of you thinking the change of
[42:16] your nature your ways your desires are
[42:19] changing you become closer to God
[42:22] through sanctification now you tell me
[42:25] that in Revelation because you don't
[42:29] know what a revelation is
[42:31] a revelation is God speaking to your
[42:33] heart to not tell you something over
[42:36] here this that will drive home with you
[42:38] no they don't you know he's telling you
[42:40] what you are
[42:42] he's dealing with your nature
[42:56] do you understand
[43:04] see when Jesus Christ calls you to
[43:07] himself that was a revelation to you of
[43:11] him revealing himself to you now simple
[43:19] do we think it's some great example
[43:24] listen then when Jesus Christ calls you
[43:29] to come to himself now is that Bible the
[43:35] Bible says no man can come unless I call
[43:39] him right now that Bible you can't come
[43:44] because you want to come you come
[43:47] because he calls you why don't you take
[43:49] what he done when he was calling you and
[43:51] to be a revelation because he was
[44:00] revealing himself to you see when God
[44:06] gives you something then that what is
[44:10] given is the word being revealed to you
[44:19] this injury God is speaking to you
[44:24] calling you to himself
[44:30] yeah but I remember when Paul saw him on
[44:33] the road to Damascus I want to be like
[44:37] Paul no you don't want to be like Paul
[44:40] what I've always told you the only said
[44:44] Paul would be this Paul to be that if
[44:45] he's here and I said Paul to be in jail
[44:47] for for midnight tonight because he'd be
[44:51] screaming out and hollering about sin
[44:53] and it wouldn't be the law to be putting
[44:55] him in jail would be the Christians the
[44:58] religious people will be the ones who
[45:00] putting it in jail court he didn't
[45:02] understand what he's talking about
[45:07] when God calls you to sanctification
[45:11] he's calling you to a closer walk with
[45:13] him
[45:20] I quit this and I quit that that's
[45:25] sanctification brother Dale I quit this
[45:26] when will I never did drink there's some
[45:34] things I didn't do that you claimed
[45:35] salvation about taking away from you and
[45:38] I never done it oh trying to be a holier
[45:47] than thou ain't worried about wholly of
[45:50] what I'm trying to preach God's Word
[45:58] sanctification is not you quitting
[46:00] smoking and chewing tobacco you know
[46:02] like that sanctification is a cleansing
[46:04] and setting aside inside of your soul to
[46:07] drive that enemy out of you right take
[46:14] that as a revelation
[46:17] if you can't see that I haven't had a
[46:20] revelation brother Dale what take what
[46:22] I'm talking about on it to the new birth
[46:30] is God revealing his word to you telling
[46:35] you what he is doing in you right
[46:45] telling you what he's doing in you so
[46:49] would that not be a personal revelation
[46:52] code it don't save you to say I saw
[46:56] brother Branham
[47:00] come on it don't save you to say bread
[47:03] around and put his hands only no now
[47:06] come on I'm not against it you say
[47:09] brother Dale you're nothing why not I'm
[47:12] not throwing no stones if it is you quit
[47:15] throw them I'll quit go we're all living
[47:18] in the Glass House right you know the
[47:22] story you don't you don't start throw
[47:24] stones if you live in the Glass House
[47:27] you don't work too good
[47:30] listen Church the new birth personally
[47:37] to you now the day he started talking to
[47:42] you about salvation no you remember that
[47:49] you remember when you first come in
[47:52] contact with God you first
[47:54] you know God begin to deal with you and
[47:57] begin to to bring you remember that
[48:00] well you know what maybe your mama your
[48:03] daddy was sitting outside early maybe
[48:07] the pastor was sitting outside of you
[48:09] and you know how he wasn't getting the
[48:11] fine
[48:12] right it was something personal to you
[48:22] right
[48:24] fountain personal to you
[48:29] something made alive to you what you see
[48:36] when I look at things I look at little
[48:38] bitty things you listen Lord you've been
[48:46] doing this for a long time you've been
[48:50] revealing yourself for a long time it's
[48:54] the people getting it but what it really
[48:58] is it's because you can make it so big
[49:01] you can't attain them to it right you
[49:06] make it so small until it you belittle
[49:08] it to make it know you go this way and
[49:10] say well well I never done like Paul I
[49:13] never sold no angel I didn't see this or
[49:16] nothing I can't even talk about things
[49:18] that brother Dale talked about seeing
[49:19] angels I can't talk about cuz I've never
[49:21] done it well what's that got to do with
[49:23] it
[49:31] you see I could see those things and
[49:33] dine this and go to hell and you could
[49:38] see the truth out of it and go to heaven
[49:44] because gifts and callings is not what
[49:46] it's built on it's not whether or not
[49:51] you've seen angels whether or not you've
[49:53] done this dreams or whatever it's
[49:55] whether or not God has revealed himself
[49:56] to you
[49:57] you said reveal yourself to me you back
[50:00] to that now get what I'm saying about
[50:01] revealing itself to you when he speaks
[50:05] to your heart and calls you to salvation
[50:08] is he not revealing himself to you
[50:16] that's how simple to new birth then the
[50:18] children can understand the children can
[50:22] know that God has been dealing with them
[50:24] right and then they come back to your
[50:26] mamas and daddies and say well I need to
[50:28] be baptized I need to do this I need
[50:30] somebody you know because they're
[50:32] beginning to see things God is speaking
[50:34] to their heart he's revealing himself I
[50:41] never thought about it like that
[50:44] what are you thinking about I mean this
[50:47] is a serious matter it's either life or
[50:49] death for you and me but I brought it
[50:56] out I just never had nothing it's a
[50:58] great revelation do you believe in one
[51:01] true and living God what greater
[51:04] revelation could be you know that the
[51:07] world is against that you know that all
[51:09] Christendom is against the revelation of
[51:12] one true and living God you mean all of
[51:14] the millions of millions of Christians
[51:17] that are out there they're against the
[51:19] thought of one true and living God
[51:22] should you not be happy about what you
[51:25] see
[51:34] I better not say it I guess in the wrong
[51:37] way but remember I didn't say it's your
[51:40] prophet said it okay he said uh Neagle
[51:45] struts you remember that you remember
[51:51] that for the Prophet saying that an
[51:53] eagle struts well you know why can't we
[51:58] strut why can't we be happy about what
[52:04] God's done why can we not be joyous
[52:08] instead of Paul well I know I'm sick oh
[52:12] I'm not having problems you don't like
[52:19] for me to preach do you because I can
[52:21] remember where the Prophet said maybe
[52:24] that's put on to you to bring you to the
[52:28] Lord we don't like that one do we we
[52:33] don't like the point that we could be
[52:35] sick not as rough don't you say that
[52:37] people who say you know that we're sick
[52:39] for the glory of the Lord he said now if
[52:41] you're going that away said let's you
[52:43] got a lag all for the glory of the Lord
[52:44] let's just cut both legs off for the
[52:46] glory of the Lord now that ain't what
[52:47] I'm talking about I'm talking about God
[52:52] is trying her faith to see whether or
[52:55] not we'll hold out and he allows trials
[52:59] and troubles and heartaches to come our
[53:00] way to see what we'll do but you know
[53:06] what it's not for him to see what we'll
[53:08] do
[53:08] he knows what we'll do it's for us to
[53:12] find out what we'll do we're gonna fold
[53:16] up go home I don't like my brother down
[53:19] if he says that no I'll just quit and go
[53:21] somewhere that's goodbye I didn't run
[53:25] you off
[53:25] I didn't say a word to run you off I
[53:29] tried to preach the gospel but if you
[53:33] think it's better somewhere that's go go
[53:36] time's running out
[53:38] but do you understand what I'm saying do
[53:41] you understand even the little point I'm
[53:43] making in the whole message yet Sunday
[53:46] this is my if I have any of these things
[53:52] a virtual knowledge temperance patience
[53:55] godliness if I have any of those God
[53:58] gave it to me to put on my new birth
[54:03] I've never tried to make anything out of
[54:06] trying to say well I'm their sound
[54:08] editor
[54:08] what I did tell you one thing this is
[54:11] the only thing God ever spoke to me
[54:12] about on it he spoke to me one day about
[54:16] patience he said if you'll have patience
[54:21] with the people he said it'll prove you
[54:26] have patience well very good point
[54:31] I wish you'd speak about the rest of
[54:33] them because I ain't doing too good on
[54:36] placements but at least I can get off of
[54:37] that and say well Lord look over here
[54:39] this is working this way anyway you
[54:40] don't move it alright listen each one of
[54:48] these virtues is given unto us to add to
[54:50] our faith the virtue is given to add it
[54:54] to your faith knowledge temperance
[54:57] patience we'll get back to those points
[54:59] of how it comes into manifestation and
[55:02] want you to do it but I want you to
[55:04] think about something I don't do things
[55:10] to be smart ethically to show how much I
[55:12] can do or whatever I can you know know I
[55:15] try to get it to where you can see how
[55:17] great God is now he said add-ins they
[55:29] had faith faith is not a virtue faith is
[55:34] a birth faith is the new birth it's not
[55:39] you can't add the new birth to anything
[55:42] cuz it has to be the product itself
[55:47] justification and sanctification just
[55:49] taking care of the vessel God comes and
[55:52] Leos that is not him going through that
[55:55] justification sanctification
[55:57] it's him coming as a new birth to live
[55:59] inside of us and then we have an
[56:02] opportunity to study the message and to
[56:07] hear these virtues explained by the
[56:10] Prophet because that's what I've always
[56:12] said see the Apostle Peter you remember
[56:17] how we've been through this over and
[56:18] over Peter and Paul couldn't teach two
[56:20] different things now Peters teaching the
[56:23] natural perfect lands with Peter Paul is
[56:25] going through the adoptions and the
[56:27] thing and if you'll read blasphemous
[56:29] names you'll hear him dealing more with
[56:31] Paul basically than he does with Peter
[56:33] but he's still teaching the statue of a
[56:35] perfect man from the lady's dream that
[56:38] she had on it says add to your faith
[56:47] all right we've established the new
[56:50] birth is that faith and then as you
[56:54] progress in your studies then things can
[56:57] be added
[57:00] well the brother Dale I think I've got
[57:02] brotherly kindness but I don't believe
[57:04] I've got patience or virtue Allah now
[57:08] that that won't work now I'm just
[57:10] telling you up front now that don't work
[57:12] don't go that route don't think you're
[57:15] gonna jump up the ladder and get the
[57:17] Holy Ghost up the top when you ain't
[57:21] even got virtue down at the bottom
[57:24] because each one has got to be laid upon
[57:27] the other one and vulcanize together and
[57:30] seal together am i quoting the prophets
[57:34] you're supposed to be leading reading
[57:35] the message
[57:38] now then
[57:45] how many church age messengers are they
[57:55] I mean so change mesengeros and
[57:59] miniature choji's are they the seven the
[58:06] many messengers are they seven
[58:13] okay
[58:17] I mean virtues are they
[58:23] and when the ads are they when you're
[58:27] just getting this off
[58:28] kind of yeah I'm just trying to get it
[58:31] sensible to be truthful
[58:37] you see if you don't understand the ages
[58:40] how are you gonna understand all of it
[58:41] and it's fitting okay how many
[58:48] manifestations of God are V in the
[58:52] church ages okay
[59:00] one two three four six seven eight
[59:04] because this is the Holy Ghost that
[59:05] seals in so don't try to make that and
[59:08] make nine out of it see you're going too
[59:10] far
[59:10] thinking you're so smart that's nine how
[59:15] many manifestations of God are there in
[59:20] church age well there's only seven
[59:23] Church ages then you're still hooked in
[59:26] time because you're in lady asiye
[59:34] mmm-hmm I mean the manifestations of God
[59:37] are they each one of these is a
[59:40] manifestation of God faith virtue
[59:43] knowledge temperance patience godliness
[59:44] brotherly kindness in love that's eight
[59:51] well I don't know where it's important
[59:53] for me to know that faith is not a bird
[59:55] or not a thing it's a birth and all that
[59:57] we've been through that way okay let's
[59:59] count again let me find it
[1:00:02] Oh number eight if they can get it
[1:00:07] pulled it up with his paragraph 217 of
[1:00:09] God's only provided place of worship but
[1:00:12] I run said there's seven a heads
[1:00:21] 7ix lucky you've got a here in seven
[1:00:27] years he's exactly right seven heads
[1:00:36] yeah I'm completely seven Church ages at
[1:00:40] Grace at this and this then there's
[1:00:42] seven ads and the last one is Christ was
[1:00:49] that and this is your charity which is
[1:00:54] what's your headstone now we go one two
[1:01:03] three four five six seven eight nine but
[1:01:07] we're really getting all in there we
[1:01:08] could have done with all that stuff
[1:01:09] tonight
[1:01:11] there's had many ads you mean listening
[1:01:16] don't add faith faith is not an ad it's
[1:01:23] a birth okay now then faith is a birth
[1:01:29] add virtue
[1:01:36] you got seven ads with eight
[1:01:41] manifestations
[1:01:49] same as you got seven church ages with
[1:01:52] eight manifestations because brother
[1:01:55] Branham was not the lady Ossian
[1:01:59] messenger
[1:02:06] brother branham was in the time of the
[1:02:08] Lady of seeing but he said don't do that
[1:02:10] he said you would make me a lady you'll
[1:02:13] see in okay
[1:02:20] take your church ages
[1:02:25] Paul Iranians Martin Colombo but random
[1:02:30] said that there was no messenger to the
[1:02:33] age of Lady of Syria he said because the
[1:02:36] holy ghost came himself for 64 seal book
[1:02:43] that there is no messenger to the lady
[1:02:47] of C&H he said because the Holy Ghost
[1:02:49] came himself in the fullness of the
[1:02:52] baptism which says as all the other ages
[1:02:56] and things are at the end of the age
[1:02:58] then the messenger comes word brother
[1:03:01] branham come did brother Branham come
[1:03:04] here and bring a message to that or did
[1:03:05] he come right here come on
[1:03:18] but you see you say well it don't matter
[1:03:20] B you don't know what age you're in you
[1:03:25] don't know what to expect you don't know
[1:03:28] what has happened we get it don't matter
[1:03:32] to you all I need just be born again all
[1:03:38] that won't do it be safe that's what my
[1:03:39] brother said years ago he said what does
[1:03:41] it matter where this that or the other
[1:03:42] about things I was talking to him one
[1:03:44] day method this is nice discussing some
[1:03:46] things with it he said what does it
[1:03:48] matter he said all I want to do is get
[1:03:49] to heaven
[1:03:52] that's all he said all I want to do is
[1:03:55] get to him well we've had fifty years to
[1:04:00] play with that little toy then all we
[1:04:03] want to do is get in the rapture all
[1:04:05] right how did we wind up Sunday I ain't
[1:04:10] looking for the rapture
[1:04:11] I quit looking for the rapture when I
[1:04:14] heard the prophets say your resurrection
[1:04:16] it inside of you read your Bible it says
[1:04:19] what it don't say rapture is not even in
[1:04:27] there they said the Lord shall descend
[1:04:30] from heaven with a shout force of
[1:04:31] Arcanine no trumpet girl when we got
[1:04:32] that right well what does they say
[1:04:35] what's the next thing for you and I the
[1:04:37] resurrection because the Bible says the
[1:04:41] dead in Christ shall rise first and we
[1:04:42] which are alive and remain shall be
[1:04:45] changed so don't worry about the rapture
[1:04:47] worry about the resurrection all right
[1:04:50] the probably said your resurrection is
[1:04:53] inside of you that's your new birth when
[1:05:04] I saw that I began to shout glory
[1:05:05] hallelujah
[1:05:06] I quit looking for some kind of a
[1:05:08] something to be a rapture
[1:05:13] we started looking to see what the
[1:05:15] resurrection had for me the Prophet said
[1:05:21] no divine healing no resurrection right
[1:05:27] think about it
[1:05:29] little simple point
[1:05:35] it's my eye God gave it to me he gave me
[1:05:41] the new birth it's mine
[1:05:43] he can't take it away because they can't
[1:05:46] he promised you so he gave me eternal
[1:05:49] life in the new birth then these are the
[1:05:52] things he expects us to add and like
[1:05:55] I've always said people think that I try
[1:05:56] to belittle this try to belittle you
[1:05:58] realize what would happen and God not
[1:06:01] sent a prophet
[1:06:03] where would we know anything about the
[1:06:06] ages in the rapture the change or the
[1:06:08] resurrection or anything come on glory
[1:06:13] hallelujah for a rapture yeah but what
[1:06:16] if we're not die what if we don't know
[1:06:19] what bus to get home well the
[1:06:21] denomination teaching rapture go down to
[1:06:29] Masonic Lodge and they'll lay it right
[1:06:30] out down in the on the floor with you
[1:06:32] and take you for faith virtue knowledge
[1:06:34] temperance patience godliness brotherly
[1:06:35] kindness I call the staircase next a lot
[1:06:41] of people teach you a lot of things that
[1:06:43] the people of this magic don't even know
[1:06:45] anything about cuz they don't want it
[1:06:49] they'd have to think
[1:06:52] I was thought I was doing pretty good do
[1:06:55] you start preaching okay it's my eye on
[1:07:02] God gave it to me he gave me the new
[1:07:05] birth the new birth is faith have faith
[1:07:10] and be born again then add virtue
[1:07:13] knowledge it all the faith and you've
[1:07:17] got one two three four five six seven
[1:07:19] adds now you got the hit stone on the
[1:07:22] church

[1:07:30] ad okay one two three four five six
[1:07:33] seven eight

[1:07:42] ages but the Holy Ghost came on a zoo
[1:07:45] sir Street I'm quoting brother branham
[1:07:49] Holy Ghost came on the zoo sir Street in
[1:07:53] the fullness of the baptism you know
[1:07:55] that a lot of people in this message
[1:07:56] still think that a zoo so street people

[1:08:43] truth is the truth it's about time to
[1:08:45] wake up

[1:08:59] new birth God gave me the new bar when
[1:09:02] that listen come on God gave you the new
[1:09:06] birth but he expects you and what's the
[1:09:10] closing point he expects you to add the
[1:09:14] virtues that's what your prophet said in
[1:09:21] the message statue of a perfect man he
[1:09:23] said these are the things he expects you
[1:09:25] to add well how can I add them you can
