[31:39] the Erwin Full Gospel Tabernacle which
[31:42] is brother Andre heads Church
[31:44] uh here is the address now after the
[31:47] service those of y'all that's going to
[31:48] the farmer's daughter listen to me
[31:50] carefully they do not take credit cards
[31:53] they do not take debit cards
[31:56] it is cash or check only
[32:00] all right the meal is the meal is twenty
[32:03] dollars each plus tax plus tip all right
[32:08] so it's going to be right about thirty
[32:10] dollars because you're all going to tip
[32:12] twenty percent all right that's what I
[32:14] thought so anyway so that'd be twenty
[32:17] four dollars and then four more dollars
[32:18] for tax so figure up about thirty
[32:20] dollars for the meal so the meal is
[32:22] going to be 30 bucks a piece and
[32:26] you'll be required to you know you're
[32:27] paying that so uh
[32:30] just keep that in mind we've got a place
[32:32] for 50 people and they're going to feed
[32:34] us there it's a buffet kind of style

[36:12] Dad brother would be were good friends
[36:13] and then him and brother Richard Wilson
[36:14] good friends and they've learned a lot
[36:16] from each other and and we glean that as
[36:19] as the congregation we glean from that
[36:22] when brother down ministers that that
[36:25] they had all that support and all they
[36:27] they could talk and fellowship back in
[36:29] the late 70s early 80s and into the 90s
[36:33] brother calling them used to go brother
[36:34] dardy used to go to ministers meetings

[37:50] we're gonna get together we'll be there
[37:52] and then everybody will be there on
[37:53] Sunday and we should have a good time in
[37:55] the Lord amen I love Fellowship
[37:58] I'm a sheep I need her I'm a herd animal
[38:01] I need people around me I ain't no loner
[38:04] I like people and uh and uh we pray that
[38:09] after I get finished with this what I'm
[38:10] fixing to say today I hope you like me
[38:12] too because we're going to talk about
[38:13] brotherly kindness but we're going to
[38:14] get into some
[38:16] eye openers all right but that's what we
[38:19] need now listen before we go we're not
[38:20] going any further without brotherly
[38:22] kindness
[38:24] we're not going any further we're not
[38:25] going we can talk headstone you can talk
[38:27] Seven Seals you can talk bringing Christ
[38:29] back to the Earth you can talk about
[38:31] Rapture you can talk about Resurrection
[38:33] but if you don't have brotherly kindness
[38:38] ain't gonna happen are you going to go
[38:39] by the grave one of the two all right so
[38:41] let's go to the Lord in prayer Lord
[38:43] thank you for all these things you've
[38:45] given us you give us an opportunity to
[38:47] have a a congregation that's that's big
[38:50] enough Lord so that we can go do things
[38:51] and help other small churches and
[38:54] fellowship with them where maybe they
[38:55] can't fellowship with anyone else that
[38:59] we can come in and fellowship with them
[39:01] and and fellowship around you there'll
[39:04] be a lot of of um a fellowship of
[39:07] getting back together of of back when
[39:09] and all that but Lord I pray that you be
[39:12] the center of everything that we do
[39:14] you be the one and that's the only
[39:16] reason we're Gathering because we're
[39:17] gathering around this message
[39:18] and we're gathering around another group
[39:20] of people another group of family
[39:22] members brothers and sisters in the Lord
[39:25] Jesus now we pray that you be with them
[39:27] up there be with those sisters and
[39:28] brothers brother Andre too as they
[39:31] prepare and get the food ready and and
[39:33] get all the things together we know what
[39:34] a task that is Lord from doing things

[39:39] Lord that helped last weekend and the
[39:41] different ones that help all the time
[39:44] um doing things getting stuff ready
[39:45] because we want to be servants we want
[39:48] to serve the people we want the people
[39:49] to feel comfortable the only person we
[39:51] want uncomfortable today is the devil
[39:54] and Lord I pray that through the
[39:56] preaching of your word that we'll hear
[39:58] from you Lord give us the eye salve Lord
[40:00] to put on our eyes and Lord give us ears
[40:02] to hear father I pray this should bless
[40:05] us be with the ones that are sick be
[40:07] brother Dale sister Dale different ones
[40:09] lord it's not here today that so desires
[40:11] to be set in this congregation again
[40:13] Lord I pray in the name of the Lord
[40:15] Jesus that your healing power will go to
[40:17] each one and give them strength to get
[40:19] back in Church Father we pray that you
[40:22] should be with us Lord further in this
[40:24] service in Jesus name
[40:25] amen
[40:27] in the beginning was the word where it
[40:29] was with God and the Word was God and
[40:31] that word was made flesh and dwelt among
[40:34] us and we beheld his glory glory the
[40:35] only begotten of the father
[40:37] full of grace
[40:39] and Truth Philippians 2 verse 3 says let
[40:42] nothing be done through Strife or vain
[40:44] Glory
[40:45] but in lowliness of Mind Let each esteem
[40:49] other
[40:50] that's hard to do
[40:53] I'm just going to tell you up front hard
[40:55] to do because of all the selfishness
[40:57] that we have but in the lowliness of
[41:00] Mind Let each esteem other better
[41:04] than themselves you may be seated in the
[41:06] Lord has blessing because remember what
[41:08] did Abraham do even without the without
[41:10] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[41:12] Abraham had an
[41:13] ending from the Old Testament and even
[41:15] under
[41:16] Ting he said okay lot we're standing
[41:19] here together we're looking at the
[41:20] planes of mammary which is green as as
[41:23] all get out and there's Sodom and
[41:24] Gomorrah you've already got two cities
[41:26] over there and then over here is the
[41:29] desert
[41:31] Abraham bless God
[41:34] I'm in the message
[41:36] I know the prophet
[41:38] that's mine
[41:40] you can take what's left over know what
[41:42] Abram what Abram Abraham do he said
[41:45] light whichever one you want
[41:48] lot took that one Abraham Abraham said
[41:50] not a problem I'll take this one but now
[41:53] who did God bless
[41:55] blessed Abraham all right he'll take
[41:57] he'll take something that we think
[41:59] sometimes is a curse and make a blessing
[42:02] out of it all right
[42:04] good to have brother George back with us
[42:06] her his sister passed away last week
[42:08] suddenly and we sure were praying for
[42:09] you and appreciate the phone call
[42:11] anything we can do you know you let us
[42:13] know but good to have him back with us
[42:15] today
[42:17] second Peter 1 says besides this giving
[42:20] all diligence add to your faith virtue
[42:22] and diverse your knowledge and knowledge
[42:23] Temperance Temperance patience
[42:25] to patience godliness and the godliness
[42:27] brotherly kindness and brotherly
[42:28] kindness
[42:29] charity so all these are ads we're
[42:31] adding these to our Christian experience
[42:35] it says
[42:37] what after in other words besides this
[42:40] what besides your new birth
[42:42] we're going to get into this when we get
[42:44] to the to the part where it says holy
[42:47] spirit because when it seals you in like
[42:49] that you come under an anointing called
[42:52] adoption or this is where your adoption
[42:54] or your placing is that is not your new
[42:57] birth
[42:58] you can be born again and not be adopted
[43:01] but you can't get be adopted and not be
[43:03] born again all right just like we were
[43:05] talking about being saved you can be
[43:07] saved and not be born again all right
[43:09] but you can't be born again and not have
[43:11] come to Salvation thereby with me on
[43:13] that all right
[43:15] so we are looking at now an ad to we're
[43:18] looking at an addition to your Christian
[43:21] Journey this is what we need to do to
[43:25] become what brother ramps calls us a
[43:27] Powerhouse
[43:28] we want to be a Powerhouse we don't want
[43:30] to come to just church today I didn't
[43:31] just come to church today to get a to
[43:33] get a firecracker
[43:35] I come for TNT I come for dunamis which
[43:40] is where you get the word Dynamite from
[43:42] I want to come with that today and get
[43:44] that and take it with me and blow the
[43:47] devil up with it all right we get so
[43:49] happy sometimes with the Devil
[43:53] well I'm going to preach anyway
[43:55] all right
[43:56] well if y'all don't just pray for me all
[43:59] right Colossians 1 verse 26 says though
[44:02] there's a mystery that mystery in the
[44:04] end time is what Christ in you the hope
[44:07] of glory and the fullness of the son of
[44:10] man and a group of people not in one in
[44:14] a group of people that takes this
[44:16] message and makes it come alive as
[44:20] Christ was alive back in 2000 years ago
[44:23] that's my goal is to see every one of us
[44:26] you me included be something that God
[44:30] can use we have been used by the devil
[44:32] long enough amen I'm sick and tired of
[44:35] being sick and tired I'm sick and tired
[44:37] of the devil taking over and having his
[44:39] way yeah all right
[44:42] but what do we do we need to get in the
[44:43] word
[44:45] you don't have to go you don't have to
[44:46] go do Hail Mary's and you know don't
[44:48] know just get back in the word of God
[44:51] which is Christ in you the hope of glory
[44:53] whom we preach
[44:55] warning every man teaching every man all
[44:57] wisdom that we may present every man
[44:59] perfect our complete in Christ that's
[45:03] what we're heading for amen
[45:04] and then we talked about the I'm trying
[45:07] to background for some that weren't here
[45:09] last week
[45:10] there was a holy spirit Veil put on Adam
[45:13] and Eve all right they had a holy ghost
[45:15] Veil on their eyes that they were naked
[45:18] and didn't know it all right but they
[45:20] were not perverted
[45:23] am I just preaching to myself today
[45:26] can somebody either nod a little louder
[45:28] or say Amen
[45:30] okay
[45:31] there was a holy spirit Veil over them
[45:34] for their nakedness now the Holy Spirit
[45:36] brother rounds was over their eyes they
[45:38] seen nothing but their brother and
[45:41] sister see
[45:42] all right the laws they didn't know they
[45:45] were naked they had the Holy Spirit Veil
[45:47] they didn't they didn't um
[45:49] uh they didn't worry about
[45:51] that what we have to worry about putting
[45:54] on clothes all right they didn't have to
[45:56] worry about that but now brother Brown
[45:58] said the spirit of unholeness
[45:59] uncleanness and lust has veiled this
[46:02] scientific age and Revelation 3 tells us
[46:05] that they're naked and don't know it
[46:07] amen but in a lustful way not in the way
[46:10] God wants it to be because even now
[46:13] we're we've come to a place to where
[46:15] we're going to have white robes we're
[46:17] not going to walk naked in the in the
[46:19] future home we're going to have white
[46:20] robes on all right brother around salmon
[46:23] white robes right right so brother uh
[46:26] this is my quote we we're putting the
[46:28] veil back on by the reveal word God has
[46:32] given us a veil to where we don't we
[46:34] don't do this I mean sometimes we
[46:36] shockingly do that for what they don't
[46:38] have on
[46:39] or whatever more but it's not it's not a
[46:42] lust Bale that we're under I hope I hope
[46:45] we kind of got away from that a little
[46:47] bit all right it's always but veil was
[46:49] being put back on by the word of God and
[46:52] by these virtues the word of God Is
[46:54] veiling Us from the outside but
[46:57] unveiling God inside of us amen all
[47:00] right brother Brown preach the unveiling
[47:02] of God now where was he unveiling God at
[47:05] thing and people that's right that's
[47:07] right not in a church not in a message
[47:09] not in a a car or or whatever you want
[47:13] to say or a tape recorder it was in the
[47:15] people he knew there'd be a people and
[47:18] the days of the voice of the seventh
[47:20] angel when he begins to sound now if the
[47:22] mystery is going to be finished or the
[47:24] mystery is going to be known it's got to
[47:26] be known to you yes it's got to be known
[47:29] to a human being all right it can't be
[47:31] known to the animals they didn't fall
[47:33] right
[47:36] they felt because we fell now we're
[47:39] trying to get us back so that they can
[47:42] come back and they won't be eating each
[47:44] other and they won't be a food chain in
[47:46] the in the uh in the out in the woods
[47:49] where one eats the other one and this
[47:51] one eats that one
[47:54] but you know what we're going to do
[47:55] we're going to do the same thing because
[47:57] you know what
[47:58] I'm gonna read you here in just a minute
[48:00] all that Spirit of selfishness and
[48:02] critical spirit
[48:04] it makes you eat people
[48:06] and you could eat up with it
[48:08] yeah brother Branham gotta eat up with
[48:10] it that ought to wake you up I'm gonna
[48:13] read you a quote he even said he had a
[48:14] critical spirit I've been reading the
[48:15] one where he said he had a selfish
[48:17] Spirit brother Branham well what are you
[48:19] trying to say he was human
[48:22] and he made human mistakes but when God
[48:26] anointed his lips to talk to me and you
[48:28] that was God Almighty talking to us amen
[48:30] Genesis 1 26 says let us make man in our
[48:34] image and after our likeness so what did
[48:36] God do he took this as brother Ryan is
[48:38] talking about love he took this agape
[48:41] love because that's what God is he's
[48:43] agape love he is not filial love he
[48:46] allowed feel your love to come into
[48:48] being because of me and you because of
[48:50] the Fall he said okay husband you'll
[48:53] love your wife
[48:55] before all that it was Agape it was
[48:58] perfect love all right that's Genesis 1
[49:00] 26 man is agape love not filio love you
[49:04] didn't come here yeah you came here with
[49:06] filial love or the other ones on down a
[49:08] little bit further but by the new birth
[49:10] it put the agape love back inside of you
[49:14] are inside of you by the new birth you
[49:17] became born in another image amen
[49:20] amen everybody with me all right if
[49:22] you're not been born in another image
[49:24] you need to look at yourself if you look
[49:26] at yourself and see yourself different
[49:28] you have been born in another image but
[49:30] if you look at yourself and say I still
[49:32] do the same things I used to do you need
[49:34] to get born again you need the new birth
[49:40] let us make man in our image so if we
[49:43] were made in the image of God God's
[49:44] agape love all right so we were made in
[49:47] agape love God brought a family into
[49:50] being to Agape Love All right we have to
[49:52] bring family in being by feel your love
[49:55] are all the other ones down through the
[49:57] line lust and all that other stuff but
[49:59] God doesn't do that he allows that to
[50:01] happen to get you here because in
[50:03] Genesis 3 he said I'll put enmity in
[50:05] other words I got to divide this up I
[50:07] can't stand to see sin anymore I got to
[50:10] have a blood covering and that blood
[50:13] covering covered Adam and Eve and then
[50:16] it covered all the way down through all
[50:18] right
[50:19] even would have covered Cain
[50:22] today
[50:23] all right so God created a man his own
[50:25] image so
[50:27] God
[50:30] is there in stone it can't be changed
[50:33] now we can come down here on the other
[50:35] side of the fall and this brother around
[50:37] him talks in the Masterpiece and we'll
[50:40] read it just a second but in the image
[50:42] of God creating him male and female
[50:44] created to them so he set up brothers
[50:46] and sisters us brothers and sisters all
[50:48] right but children of God is what come
[50:51] forth from God agape love remember
[50:54] brother Ryan went across the curtain of
[50:56] time what do you tell what do people
[50:57] they said he said what is this
[51:00] he said the angel said oh this is
[51:02] perfect what
[51:03] perfect love
[51:05] that's agape love that over there is not
[51:08] filial love he can hook the sisters they
[51:10] could say my precious brother and put
[51:12] their arm around him and nobody be no
[51:13] feeling he said all right so that was
[51:16] what we came from praise the Lord and
[51:18] that's what we're going back to amen but
[51:20] we gotta have part of it right here
[51:22] because if you've got that Genesis 1 26
[51:25] man inside of you you have Agape Love
[51:27] Inside that's the war the war if you
[51:30] break the war down it's the two loves
[51:34] agape love which is the love of Jesus
[51:36] Christ which is your new birth it is
[51:39] perfect
[51:41] and then you got you
[51:43] right that was born in the other one
[51:46] that's the two ones that are fighting
[51:48] each other all right and listen if you
[51:50] don't have the new birth there's no
[51:51] fight you just you just feel your love
[51:53] that's it
[51:54] I love this I love that you know I love
[51:56] this now the love of God
[51:59] as I said before the love of God
[52:01] sometimes is strange it feels strange to
[52:04] us because
[52:05] the world wants to see that Jesus was
[52:08] the prince of peace right he said I'm
[52:10] the Prince of Peace
[52:12] he had a pretty tumultuous life
[52:17] he got mad
[52:19] angry
[52:21] uh he called the religious world the
[52:25] devil
[52:26] snakes vipers father the devil right
[52:30] and I don't think he said it real calmly
[52:33] under his breath
[52:35] why he got a little frustrated
[52:38] because he was a human man
[52:40] but inside of him though was the agape
[52:42] love because that's what took him to
[52:43] Calvary feeling your love will not take
[52:46] you to Calvary
[52:47] agape love is the only thing that will
[52:49] take you to your Calvary because we all
[52:50] got to be right crucified with Christ is
[52:52] what Paul said all right so he created
[52:55] him in his own image but when that image
[52:57] came it became marred
[53:00] but now brother random we look at it as
[53:02] as oh man it's ruined it's marred not in
[53:06] God that's right because brother random
[53:08] I'm gonna read here in just a few
[53:09] minutes brother Brown said that stroke
[53:11] that marred the statue
[53:17] it brought out the bride
[53:21] as a masterpiece family
[53:24] the mark on the knee of the Moses statue
[53:28] made it special
[53:32] it was the stroke that cut the side of
[53:34] his master this his Masterpiece that
[53:36] brought out the bride and now we see
[53:38] them as a masterpiece family in the
[53:40] Garden of Eden how beautiful it pleased
[53:42] him he took a rest he said I'll rest
[53:46] but while he was resting and trusting
[53:48] his Masterpiece his enemy came in and
[53:50] found this Great Masterpiece and by
[53:52] deceit he crawls under the Garden of
[53:54] Eden and marred this beautiful
[53:56] Masterpiece he martyred it so it fell
[53:59] but now in the fall
[54:01] all hope was not lost in the fall what
[54:04] was the whole deal God was able to now
[54:08] get into man more now remember we talked
[54:12] about Moses David Sampson all of them
[54:14] had power but they didn't have character
[54:16] all right if Moses have been born again
[54:19] like brother Donnie sitting here he
[54:21] would have not killed in an Egyptian he
[54:23] would have not done the things he did
[54:25] all right but he had power from God
[54:27] because he was chosen to do with the
[54:31] anointing and we're going to get into
[54:33] that maybe in a couple of sermons and
[54:34] probably do it at brother Andres is talk
[54:37] about anointed for the time there's an
[54:39] anointing for the time now listen a new
[54:41] birth is not an anointing
[54:43] right the new birth is your birth it's a
[54:46] person it's something that sticks to you
[54:48] praise God and it's Eternal but now you
[54:52] can have an anointing that's not eternal
[54:55] knowing it was a ten times
[54:58] you can people can be anointed to write
[55:00] songs
[55:02] people in this message anointed to write
[55:04] songs and be laying in the bed of
[55:06] adultery during what time they're doing
[55:07] it yeah that's power without character
[55:09] because they yield their self to what an
[55:12] anointing they yield their self the
[55:14] world Listen today you're Anointed with
[55:16] something yes
[55:17] you're either anointed to preach you're
[55:19] anointing to listen you're anointed to
[55:20] be a deacon you're anointed to be a
[55:22] wonderful wife or a husband that's an
[55:24] anointing that see that comes uh
[55:28] regardless of your new birth brother
[55:29] John didn't become a husband now it
[55:31] might become a good one when he got born
[55:33] again but sister Alicia's no don't don't
[55:35] shake your head neither neither way just
[55:38] leave it at that no he was a good
[55:40] husband I'm sure but but now that he's
[55:42] born again he's a wonderful husband see
[55:44] what I'm talking about so you always
[55:45] have that anointing of what you were
[55:47] remember brother Ryan said remember
[55:49] you're born a prophet but now remember
[55:51] that you got to be careful because
[55:53] brother Branham remember he had to be
[55:56] born again he wasn't he didn't say that
[55:59] that anointing Birch you
[56:02] yeah
[56:02] it just anointed you right
[56:06] brother Branham had the new birth now we
[56:08] can agree everybody in this building
[56:10] brother Brandon was born again
[56:12] amen right but why did he stand in the
[56:15] pulpit and he said I'm waiting on him
[56:16] waiting on who
[56:18] I thought he had the who inside of him
[56:20] yeah
[56:21] he was waiting on a special anointing he
[56:24] was waiting on his Malachi 4 Revelations
[56:27] 10 7. he was waiting on that anointing
[56:30] to come behold I'll send you Elijah the
[56:32] prophet will God sent him but he had to
[56:35] anoint him to do the things he did all
[56:37] right because you and I have the same
[56:38] New Birth that that brother Brown had or
[56:41] God's different amen he's not different
[56:42] but he comes with different anointings
[56:44] at different levels Jesus stood one day
[56:47] opened the book and he said in other
[56:49] words I've been anointed
[56:51] look on the River Jordan I'm preaching
[56:54] my sermon for next Sunday
[56:55] luck on the River Jordan now he didn't
[56:57] need the Holy Ghost
[56:59] everybody with me he didn't need the
[57:01] Holy Ghost he was God
[57:03] he was the Holy Ghost whatever that
[57:05] spirit inside of him was not the spirit
[57:07] of immortal man that's right or a normal
[57:10] human being amen so what came on him at
[57:13] the River Jordan he didn't get the Holy
[57:15] Ghost like me and you get it
[57:17] he got an anointing to send him forward
[57:20] into his ministry all right because you
[57:23] proved that in the Book of Luke he said
[57:25] I've been anointed to preach the gospel
[57:26] to bring good tidy and remember he
[57:29] stopped
[57:30] why'd he stop that wasn't time for that
[57:33] anointing the time for the anointing is
[57:35] over here now when he's going to destroy
[57:37] the world and he wasn't going to judge
[57:39] the world Amen
[57:41] so anyway so that's kind of where if you
[57:43] look at that anointing you can see even
[57:45] even these are anointing
[57:48] because it's not your birth
[57:50] your birth is down here then you add to
[57:54] you're anointed to these different
[57:56] things and I'll prove to you a little
[57:57] bit because I want to read a couple of
[57:59] quotes
[58:00] I know we got started late I won't do
[58:02] very much this morning but we'll get to
[58:04] it this afternoon but Moses had power
[58:06] without character David look at David a
[58:08] man after God's Own heart listen a man
[58:11] that that God
[58:13] said my heart beats with David's heart
[58:17] that's what he said yeah
[58:19] a man after my own heart
[58:23] now we're going to look at David and
[58:25] call him a murderer
[58:27] a liar an adulterer
[58:30] premeditated murder he would have got a
[58:32] life sentence or either he'd got
[58:34] electrocuted if he'd been in this and
[58:35] have been in the end time because he
[58:37] premeditated that it wasn't just he got
[58:39] mad and struck him no he mapped the
[58:42] whole thing out and brought his best
[58:45] General besides Uriah and said uh
[58:49] withdraw him
[58:50] you know withdrawal leave him out there
[58:52] well that man knew too but he wasn't
[58:54] going to go against the king
[58:57] that wasn't a new birth
[58:59] no
[59:01] Samson Abraham Jacob Noah Saul Elisha
[59:04] all these different ones they had flaws
[59:07] but now we we all right now they had
[59:09] flaws right
[59:11] we're not putting them down because
[59:12] watch this the first Corinthians 10
[59:14] verse once is moreover president I would
[59:16] not that you should be ignorant how that
[59:18] all our fathers were under the cloud now
[59:20] this is Paul talking about the Jews in
[59:23] the wilderness everybody with me all
[59:25] right I feel like I'm preaching to
[59:26] nobody today all right so somebody
[59:28] either say man or amen amen I'm gonna
[59:31] preach it anyway I'm gonna preach till
[59:32] 11 45 so y'all just sit there and pay
[59:35] attention or just sit there
[59:41] was in the cloud in the sea and he'd all
[59:44] eats the same spiritual meat in other
[59:45] words they weren't Gentiles they weren't
[59:48] worldly people right they were in the
[59:51] message of the hour let's say Amen
[59:54] they were following the message of the
[59:57] hour they were following the prophet of
[1:00:01] the hour they were following the
[1:00:03] anointing of the hours
[1:00:08] and did all drink the same spiritual
[1:00:10] drink for the drink of the rock
[1:00:12] that followed him and that rock was
[1:00:15] Christ kind of a strange rock you know
[1:00:16] you get up in the morning the Rocks
[1:00:17] there
[1:00:18] you go two or three miles you get up the
[1:00:20] next morning The Rock's there flowing
[1:00:22] with water uh watering two million
[1:00:24] people yeah and horses and camels and
[1:00:27] all that other stuff all right but with
[1:00:29] many of them God God is not well pleased
[1:00:32] how about that today for they were
[1:00:34] overthrown in the wilderness now these
[1:00:37] things were our examples
[1:00:39] so Moses is our example Abraham
[1:00:42] how many sermons
[1:00:45] have you heard Moses name mentioned
[1:00:49] how many sermons have you heard Abraham
[1:00:51] boy now Abraham
[1:00:53] what if you took all them out of the
[1:00:55] Bible
[1:00:56] took them all out Noah oh that was a
[1:00:59] flood
[1:01:00] I don't know how anybody got across yeah
[1:01:02] we do no it did because God anointing
[1:01:04] Noah to build an ark so these things are
[1:01:08] our example to the intent we should not
[1:01:10] lust after those evil things they lusted
[1:01:14] after in other words I don't want to
[1:01:15] paraphrase but that's kind of what he
[1:01:16] was saying as they also lusted all right
[1:01:19] neither be ye idolaters as were some of
[1:01:23] them matters written the people sat down
[1:01:24] to eat and drink and Rose up to play
[1:01:26] neither let us commit fornication as
[1:01:28] some of them committed and fell in one
[1:01:30] day 23
[1:01:32] 000 people got killed in one day out of
[1:01:35] the children of Israel because they
[1:01:38] committed fornication neither let us
[1:01:42] tempt Christ as some of them also
[1:01:44] tempted and were destroyed by serpents
[1:01:46] neither murmur you amen
[1:01:49] murmur
[1:01:51] try that sometime
[1:01:52] quit murmuring
[1:01:54] as some of them also murmured and were
[1:01:57] destroyed of the Destroyer now all these
[1:02:00] things happened unto them for in Sample
[1:02:03] are examples and they were written for
[1:02:06] our admonition in other words so we can
[1:02:08] preach brother John we can teach about
[1:02:11] these people and say look we know David
[1:02:13] was a man after God's Own Heart he wrote
[1:02:15] the Psalms and he wrote these different
[1:02:16] things and and God loved him
[1:02:19] but he had a flaw
[1:02:23] but to flaw to me made the masterpiece
[1:02:26] that's what me and somebody else were
[1:02:27] talking the other day now David great
[1:02:29] David right everybody with me David
[1:02:31] great David David God thought so much to
[1:02:34] David he said your throne is going to be
[1:02:36] forever
[1:02:37] somebody is going to sit on your throne
[1:02:39] he said I'm gonna sit on your throne as
[1:02:41] the son of David through the Millennium
[1:02:43] that's how much I think of you David
[1:02:46] right right now what was David's daddy's
[1:02:49] name
[1:02:52] Jesse right
[1:02:56] he comes and he tells Samuel here's all
[1:02:58] my kids you know this and and got you
[1:03:01] know got them lined up
[1:03:03] Samuel says None of these
[1:03:06] what
[1:03:08] I can't get the anointing to fall on
[1:03:09] none of these
[1:03:11] right
[1:03:14] he walks up to one not sure but he walks
[1:03:17] up to the eldest
[1:03:19] Samuel's standing there with the
[1:03:21] anointing on him to anoint a king
[1:03:25] all right nothing happens
[1:03:27] come on what some of y'all doing now
[1:03:28] nothing's happening
[1:03:30] so you go to number two go to number
[1:03:32] three
[1:03:34] nothing four five six
[1:03:39] wow
[1:03:41] something's going on God sent me here
[1:03:43] right here I'm a prophet of God God sent
[1:03:46] me here
[1:03:47] he said going on a king go to Jesse's
[1:03:50] house and anoint a king
[1:03:53] so he takes the oil
[1:03:55] doesn't ring out doesn't ring a bell
[1:04:00] he says is there something going on
[1:04:03] what's my whole point we talk about
[1:04:06] David we talk about his brothers we talk
[1:04:08] about his daddy Jesse but David had a
[1:04:11] mama
[1:04:14] David had a mama that you'll never know
[1:04:16] until we get on the other side who she
[1:04:18] is but she was very intrical
[1:04:22] because David remember was the baby
[1:04:26] he was mama's boy
[1:04:28] and his mama
[1:04:30] taught him well
[1:04:31] he said oh no no no well wait a minute
[1:04:33] let's go with Jacob look at all the
[1:04:35] mothers in the Bible
[1:04:37] that have helped their kids but you
[1:04:39] never heard of David's Mama what are you
[1:04:40] trying to say you your man your name may
[1:04:42] never be called from the pulpit your
[1:04:44] name may never be called in the Bible or
[1:04:47] in a sermon but I promise you you are
[1:04:50] worth something
[1:04:52] you all have an anointing for a job that
[1:04:55] you do whether you just raise kids
[1:04:57] whether you teach Sunday school whether
[1:04:59] you whether you go and work and and
[1:05:02] Shine Your Light somewhere amen amen
[1:05:11] but you never heard of her but she had
[1:05:13] to be an integral part she kept those
[1:05:15] kids together
[1:05:18] and she made a house good enough to
[1:05:21] where God sent Samuel the prophet to
[1:05:23] that house to anoint a king
[1:05:26] he just didn't know it was David he
[1:05:28] thought you know the big tall one the
[1:05:31] eldest no it was a little boy that was
[1:05:33] out in the field
[1:05:35] watching sheep but they were given for
[1:05:37] example so now that's that's an example
[1:05:39] for us that we as Christians and we talk
[1:05:42] about brotherly kindness listen
[1:05:44] brotherly slash sisterly kindness
[1:05:49] they ain't just on the brothers
[1:05:51] we sisters we sisters I'm talking about
[1:05:53] we sisters need to do it too well that
[1:05:56] wasn't funny
[1:05:57] at least you laughed
[1:05:59] amen and laugh let's see if we can get
[1:06:01] those two together so example or example
[1:06:05] means a pattern look watch this
[1:06:08] what did we just talk about the stroke
[1:06:10] that marred the Masterpiece right
[1:06:13] that word example means a stroke or a
[1:06:16] blow
[1:06:18] to all these were struck
[1:06:21] somehow in their life for me and you
[1:06:25] listen we will always have these great
[1:06:28] ones in the Old Testament we will always
[1:06:30] have their name called because they're
[1:06:32] going to be the pillars over there of
[1:06:34] that new city remember 12 Patriarchs 12
[1:06:37] Apostles right not gonna forget them
[1:06:39] they're gonna be there the tribes all
[1:06:42] the 12 tribes you know what they're
[1:06:43] named after people
[1:06:47] right
[1:06:48] right that's right
[1:06:50] a figure formed by a blow or an
[1:06:53] impression in other words Abraham made
[1:06:55] an impression on us
[1:06:57] because we talk about him giving his
[1:06:59] life his wife away
[1:07:00] twice laughing at God
[1:07:05] David
[1:07:07] killing his best friend
[1:07:10] Jacob Jacob just he if he went to to Las
[1:07:15] Vegas he'd be the biggest gamble there
[1:07:17] was
[1:07:18] because he deceived everything and
[1:07:21] everybody that he touched or came into
[1:07:23] contact with all right until he came in
[1:07:26] contact with God he spent one night with
[1:07:29] God and he wrestled with him maybe we
[1:07:31] ought to do that sometime and wrestle
[1:07:33] with God and walk different because
[1:07:35] remember God struck him on the fire and
[1:07:37] he became a limping Prince well now his
[1:07:39] name's changed to Israel and everybody
[1:07:42] knew that there was something different
[1:07:44] about Jacob well that's the same way
[1:07:46] about your new birth do you walk
[1:07:48] different than what you did before
[1:07:50] right the teaching which embodies the
[1:07:53] sum and substance of religion and
[1:07:55] represents it to the Mind manner of
[1:07:57] writing and content form of letter in
[1:07:59] other words we look back at the Old
[1:08:00] Testament
[1:08:01] to see these examples all right which is
[1:08:05] I'm getting to something here because
[1:08:07] Jesus stood one day and he said I give
[1:08:09] you a new commandment
[1:08:11] right I I you know don't do away with
[1:08:14] that remember he he became the law
[1:08:16] he came under the law he made it
[1:08:19] Honorable in other words he made it
[1:08:21] where we could live it
[1:08:23] that's right because they couldn't live
[1:08:24] it in the Old Testament they didn't they
[1:08:26] didn't have anything to leave it with
[1:08:28] because they would have an anointing
[1:08:30] that would anoint Moses to where you
[1:08:31] couldn't even look at him his face
[1:08:33] shines so much with God God's presence
[1:08:37] and then he could go kill an Egyptian
[1:08:39] and and strike the rock instead of
[1:08:41] speaking to it disobeying God
[1:08:44] right
[1:08:46] it's a pattern of warning of ruinous
[1:08:48] events which serve as admonitions or
[1:08:50] warning to others that's what we look
[1:08:51] back to
[1:08:53] but Jesus stood and he or things
[1:08:55] prefigured the future of Messianic
[1:08:57] person which is Jesus Christ he's
[1:09:00] standing there saying a new commandment
[1:09:01] he said you're living the best you can
[1:09:03] what did he tell the Rich Young Ruler
[1:09:05] the Rich Young Ruler said I've lived all
[1:09:07] 10.
[1:09:09] did you not say that I've lived all Ten
[1:09:12] Commandments from my youth
[1:09:14] you can't condemn me of not living the
[1:09:17] Ten Commandments
[1:09:18] Jesus said okay you gotta do one more
[1:09:22] thing
[1:09:23] so that's right
[1:09:25] you gotta sell all
[1:09:29] and become me
[1:09:35] he didn't say enough shall all and
[1:09:37] become your neighbor
[1:09:38] come up somebody sell all and go back to
[1:09:41] your daddy now he had a daddy Mama too
[1:09:44] he said sell all take up your cross and
[1:09:47] follow me what cross did that come from
[1:09:50] it come from that yes that was a
[1:09:52] cross-ship that Jesus bought
[1:09:55] anybody with me on that think about that
[1:09:57] he was telling the Rich Young Ruler hey
[1:10:00] you got to be me yes you've done all
[1:10:03] this that law is good that's letter
[1:10:06] you passed the letter test but if you
[1:10:09] pass the spiritual test have you passed
[1:10:12] the virtue test
[1:10:15] remember he didn't
[1:10:18] uh he knew the message in about every
[1:10:20] quote
[1:10:22] come on the Commandments right
[1:10:26] right don't do this do that
[1:10:28] wear your dress is long don't cut your
[1:10:30] hair
[1:10:31] come to church
[1:10:36] but he never became
[1:10:39] he couldn't go that far
[1:10:42] he was selfish
[1:10:44] that's what we're gonna get into because
[1:10:46] brotherly kindness you have to do away
[1:10:48] with selfishness
[1:10:50] all right so let's read this real quick
[1:10:52] besides just giving all diligence add to
[1:10:54] your faith virtue diverse your knowledge
[1:10:56] and all his Temperance Temperance
[1:10:57] patience patience godliness godliness
[1:10:59] brotherly kindness and your brother
[1:11:01] kindless charity now remember brotherly
[1:11:03] kindness or let's say brotherly sisterly
[1:11:06] charity or or kindness comes from the
[1:11:09] word Philadelphia which is two words and
[1:11:11] we'll read it in a minute but it
[1:11:13] literally means to love your brother
[1:11:15] all right love with the brothers or
[1:11:17] sisters in the New Testament look he
[1:11:20] didn't say any old
[1:11:22] there was no love there was no agape
[1:11:24] love now listen God would come down as
[1:11:26] Jehovah and would anoint people because
[1:11:29] of agape love
[1:11:31] but he couldn't put that agape love
[1:11:33] inside of the people in the Old
[1:11:35] Testament
[1:11:36] because he hadn't come and released a
[1:11:38] life yet
[1:11:39] all right
[1:11:40] which Christians cherish for each other
[1:11:43] as brethren
[1:11:44] now remember that we were talking about
[1:11:46] this last Sunday there's an inward work
[1:11:48] of virtue knowledge Temperance and
[1:11:50] patience that's something you got to do
[1:11:51] an upward of being more like God and
[1:11:54] then your outward appearance is your
[1:11:56] brotherly kindness and love you can hide
[1:11:58] a lot of things but I'll promise you I'm
[1:12:00] fixing to read something here in just a
[1:12:02] minute and I hope I want the cameras
[1:12:04] turned on your face
[1:12:08] I'm warning you oh now y'all gonna be
[1:12:11] good
[1:12:16] but what about inside
[1:12:18] don't be like Jesus said Dead Man's bone
[1:12:26] I'll be hitting I
[1:12:30] your anger
[1:12:32] your faith face
[1:12:35] will betray you
[1:12:38] right all right all right so this is the
[1:12:40] compound word involving philio which is
[1:12:42] love and Adolphus which his brother
[1:12:45] literally means the love of the brother
[1:12:46] now listen to brother Bradham
[1:12:49] it comes from agape love to feel your
[1:12:51] love to lust down this way now what
[1:12:53] happened was Jesus came and plopped
[1:12:54] himself down here in this earth and
[1:12:57] worked his way back the other way with
[1:12:58] us with it that's right right
[1:13:01] he came here with us and him
[1:13:05] amen
[1:13:07] and he went back to heaven with us and
[1:13:10] him
[1:13:11] but he didn't keep it he came back onto
[1:13:13] that Pentecost
[1:13:15] set it back down the love of God he sent
[1:13:17] it back to 120 and put it in them and
[1:13:20] that's what he's been doing since 2000
[1:13:23] years ago all right he's been putting
[1:13:25] agape love back into his children and as
[1:13:29] we said before remember
[1:13:32] when you say God bless you brother you
[1:13:35] are denoting that that person is in your
[1:13:38] family
[1:13:40] you're connected
[1:13:42] by family that's my brother that's my
[1:13:45] sister
[1:13:46] all right
[1:13:47] do we really mean that
[1:13:51] um
[1:13:53] all right brother I'm talking about
[1:13:54] putting yourself in this place I gotta
[1:13:55] hurry around here to get to this have
[1:13:57] patience with him now watch this right

[1:18:09] was drunk
[1:18:10] they heard her in there kind of snubbing
[1:18:13] to herself singing real low
[1:18:16] must Jesus bath
[1:18:19] the cross

[1:18:36] one drunk looked at the other one said
[1:18:39] she's a Christian she's got it
[1:18:42] and that little woman led her husband
[1:18:45] plus these others to Christ that night
[1:18:49] say why see just be real
[1:18:53] sweet
[1:18:57] you believe that story I mean brother
[1:18:58] around me is a liar if that's not a
[1:19:00] story that he told that he knew somebody
[1:19:02] had told him about right he may not have
[1:19:04] been part of it but he sure he's a
[1:19:06] wonderful Storyteller and he weaves it
[1:19:07] into his sermon
[1:19:09] she's a Christian and that little woman
[1:19:11] led her husband plus these others to
[1:19:14] Christ
[1:19:15] that night
[1:19:18] she didn't have to cut
[1:19:21] but she didn't have to call Pastor
[1:19:26] she didn't have to call the preacher
[1:19:29] should not put on tape
[1:19:36] and they saw it in her amen
[1:19:39] how many of us could have passed that
[1:19:41] test don't raise your hand because I
[1:19:43] know none of us
[1:19:45] maybe one or two
[1:19:52] John 13 34. listen that's an example of
[1:19:56] a Christian
[1:19:57] you can say well that's far-faction
[1:19:59] you're using a telling you what the
[1:20:01] prophet said if he put it in here
[1:20:04] and weaved it into a sermon guess who
[1:20:06] it's for amen what for the world
[1:20:10] hey for you yes sir
[1:20:13] I'll clap myself
[1:20:15] [Applause]
[1:20:18] enough of us to help us get out of that
[1:20:21] yes by telling us that story and saying
[1:20:24] man I have really messed up
[1:20:29] John 13 34 says a new commandment now
[1:20:32] here's Jesus standing he's he's giving
[1:20:34] him a new commandment
[1:20:36] that you love one another as I have
[1:20:38] loved you that you also
[1:20:40] love one another look by this shall all
[1:20:43] men know that that woman was a Christian
[1:20:46] right if you have love
[1:20:49] one for the other
[1:20:52] but this shall all men know that you are
[1:20:55] my disciples
[1:20:56] in other words an outward display
[1:20:59] if you have love
[1:21:00] one to the other remember disciples
[1:21:03] means discipline those disciples were
[1:21:06] disciplined to what Jesus said all right
[1:21:08] but it is an outward display Proverbs 25
[1:21:10] 21 it says it's not any enemy be hungry
[1:21:14] bless God he can make it for herself
[1:21:18] he's the one that made the mistake
[1:21:21] it's not what the Bible says
[1:21:23] if he be thirsty give him water to drink
[1:21:27] for Thou shalt he calls of fire on his
[1:21:30] head and the Lord shall reward you
[1:21:34] when I tell y'all last Sunday or Sunday
[1:21:36] before last
[1:21:37] you know how to stop an argument
[1:21:40] don't respond
[1:21:43] you know what creates an argument you
[1:21:45] responded
[1:21:50] listen now I have I have argued with
[1:21:53] myself a few times
[1:21:55] but I didn't get anywhere with it but
[1:21:57] now I've argued with other people and
[1:22:00] really messed up bad how many of y'all
[1:22:02] have argued when someone
[1:22:07] uh-huh and and felt better about it when
[1:22:11] you argue
[1:22:14] you always feel worse
[1:22:17] always
[1:22:21] see I told you
[1:22:23] glad we brought supper I mean lunch
[1:22:25] today
[1:22:26] y'all not gonna give me anything to eat
[1:22:29] can I have some cookies
[1:22:31] oh thank you Michael
[1:22:34] gives cookies to his people to come to
[1:22:36] his Sunday Hill class
[1:22:38] Ryan and Bob don't
[1:22:42] just saying the Lord is well pleased but
[1:22:45] give you to laugh a little bit because
[1:22:46] there's a there's a black fog in here he
[1:22:49] he will magnify the lawmaker honorable
[1:22:52] so God God in flesh took stood and said
[1:22:54] hey hey I am the Commandments
[1:22:57] but I'm gonna give you this new one
[1:22:59] living
[1:23:02] like I live it
[1:23:05] because remember the Pharisees even live
[1:23:08] the Ten Commandments
[1:23:11] but they had in their heart
[1:23:14] Mischief they had in their heart that
[1:23:17] they didn't like what was going on
[1:23:20] so God come to magnify the lawmaker
[1:23:22] honorable he did not come to do away
[1:23:24] with it because he kept telling him a
[1:23:25] new commandment I give you now remember
[1:23:27] the old commandment was and we'll close
[1:23:28] right here the old commandment was if
[1:23:31] Michael killed Terence I went after
[1:23:34] Michael and I was I was totally under
[1:23:36] the law of the levitical law to kill him
[1:23:40] I mean murder him take him out and cut
[1:23:42] his head off and God did not hold that
[1:23:45] against me in the Old Testament
[1:23:48] all right eye for an eye two for a tooth
[1:23:51] life for a life
[1:23:53] and now right all right if you caught
[1:23:55] with caught in the active adulterer you
[1:23:57] were putting you were you were killed
[1:23:58] the person you and the person uh there
[1:24:00] was one instance where that they brought
[1:24:02] an idol in and remember God brought the
[1:24:04] man and the woman in a tent and whoever
[1:24:06] it was Phineas or one of them took a
[1:24:08] sword and stuck it through both of them
[1:24:10] and killed them both they were honorable
[1:24:12] to do that
[1:24:13] that's right
[1:24:16] but Jesus
[1:24:18] if he come to magnify the law
[1:24:21] now he's telling us we can kill people
[1:24:24] without touching them
[1:24:29] let your communication be yay nay nay
[1:24:32] for whatsoever is more than these
[1:24:33] comments of evil you have heard that
[1:24:35] it's been said an eye for an eye or
[1:24:37] tooth for a tooth but I say unto you I'm
[1:24:39] not doing away with that I'm just
[1:24:41] telling you why agape love will do if
[1:24:43] you put it in this law
[1:24:45] amen there was nothing that was it was
[1:24:48] filial love down here because it was
[1:24:50] down here for the people God always was
[1:24:52] agape love but there was no way he could
[1:24:54] connect them sin was so bad I was
[1:24:56] thinking yesterday even being Christians
[1:24:58] and being as much godliness as we are
[1:25:01] we're dying
[1:25:03] as much holy as much as you know we come
[1:25:06] to church and and you see people like
[1:25:08] that in different ones in the 80s and
[1:25:10] that's just a sin curse
[1:25:13] there's nothing you can do about it
[1:25:16] there is but I'm telling you when
[1:25:19] brother Brown told Bill Dahl he said
[1:25:21] I'll see you again I'll shake your hand
[1:25:22] at the Tabernacle or wherever it was now
[1:25:24] whatever was hot wrong with Brother Bill
[1:25:26] now cancer or whatever it was yeah God
[1:25:28] took that away but it didn't make him
[1:25:29] 18.
[1:25:32] he still had a hard time probably
[1:25:34] getting out of the car yeah yeah and he
[1:25:36] shook brother around his hand like this
[1:25:39] because he was 92 right right that's how
[1:25:43] bad the sin curse is but God has given
[1:25:46] us a message that it will live it amen
[1:25:50] come on somebody that's our anointing
[1:25:58] destroy the works of Satan destroy the
[1:26:00] works of death because where did Death
[1:26:02] start in the garden
[1:26:05] but I say unto you that you resist not
[1:26:07] evil whosoever shall smite thee on the
[1:26:09] cheek give him the other one
[1:26:11] oh yeah I'll give him another one all
[1:26:14] right
[1:26:15] give him another five
[1:26:18] ain't that what we'd do
[1:26:20] if a man shall Sue thee it's a law
[1:26:23] hey if he wants your car give him a
[1:26:25] house
[1:26:27] I already failed all right all right
[1:26:29] every one of you I'll try because a lot
[1:26:32] of y'all in your heart you said I ain't
[1:26:33] gonna do that
[1:26:34] amen amen amen that's what I thought
[1:26:37] ever shall compel me to go a mile go too
[1:26:41] give him that ass from me that would
[1:26:43] borrow and turn right away
[1:26:45] you've heard it said that thou shalt
[1:26:47] Love Thy Neighbor
[1:26:48] and hate thine enemy now that's what
[1:26:50] they've heard from the priest with the
[1:26:53] Torah in the Old Testament that's what
[1:26:55] God Said to the people
[1:26:57] the Torah was the word of God to the
[1:26:59] people that's what they preached from

[1:34:40] lot of people go through life that don't
[1:34:42] realize they got burdens on them and

[1:34:46] obligated to tell them yeah oh he's
[1:34:48] obligated tell them you're lost
[1:34:51] but I'm like brother Branham
[1:34:53] brother Brown said one time he said if I
[1:34:55] was God
[1:34:56] he said I tell you one time
[1:34:58] he said I wouldn't dare you again but
[1:35:00] thank God for grace and thank God that
[1:35:03] we're not God
[1:35:04] amen
[1:35:06] we'll get into it this afternoon we're
[1:35:08] running around talks about having a
[1:35:10] critical spirit we're criticize
[1:35:11] everything he said Lord take that away
[1:35:13] from me
[1:35:15] take that selfish spirit away from me
[1:35:17] take that critical spirit away from me
[1:35:19] and I'll read it to you but it's real
[1:35:21] profound because his critical spirit was
[1:35:24] now now

[1:35:29] hair is too long
[1:35:31] and you know he ain't been Church what

[1:35:35] Brian didn't say that I'm gonna read it
[1:35:37] to you brother Brown said I was just
[1:35:39] critical in my heart
[1:35:42] that's right nobody else knew what he
[1:35:44] said but me
[1:35:45] he said but God condemned me because it
[1:35:48] was in my heart I was critical he said
[1:35:50] I'd see a woman walk by and he'd say oh
[1:35:52] God you're the Destroyer remember he did
[1:35:54] that when he was in the restaurant
[1:35:56] a woman sitting there with his arms
[1:35:58] around and he had just a mess
[1:36:00] and brother Brian was like God just wipe
[1:36:03] this whole thing off
[1:36:06] God said
[1:36:11] let me take you behind the door here for
[1:36:13] a minute uh you and I have talked
[1:36:15] together we're fixing to have a
[1:36:17] conversation it's going to be just one
[1:36:19] way
[1:36:20] right
[1:36:22] he didn't go back there and argue with
[1:36:23] God God said um let me show you your
[1:36:27] sins

[1:36:31] and the man's and the police officer and
[1:36:32] all that I'm gonna show you yours right

[1:36:39] the Lord's head and said blood and
[1:36:41] splatter everywhere
[1:36:44] and God said those are your sins hitting
[1:36:47] him in the head a prophet
[1:36:50] but he was being critical he was
[1:36:52] condemning
[1:36:54] oh yeah sure we condemn things
[1:36:58] right
[1:36:59] but we shouldn't do it with a critical
[1:37:00] spirit

[1:37:06] what does he mean let him criticize
[1:37:08] through his word because he God is going
[1:37:10] to tell you what's true he's not gonna
[1:37:12] he's not gonna stop so but he's gonna
[1:37:14] tell you what's true and if you don't do
