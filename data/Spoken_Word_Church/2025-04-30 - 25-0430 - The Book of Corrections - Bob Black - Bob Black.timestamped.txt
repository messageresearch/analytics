[0:00] We need something. Lord, you give us the
[0:01] way the way out. Lord, you give us the
[0:05] remedy. Lord, everything that we are
[0:07] tonight, everything from our the bottoms
[0:10] of our feet to the head tip of our heads
[0:12] is yours Lord because you said that you
[0:14] bought us with a price. We ask Lord that
[0:17] you'll just come Lord and tonight and
[0:19] just be feel welcome to be with us. Help
[0:21] us, L Lord, tonight Lord, as you'll take
[0:23] these words off the page, Lord, and that
[0:26] your spirit will give them meaning and
[0:28] make them come alive to us. We pray in
[0:30] your name. Amen.
[0:33] Amen. We're going to read tonight from
[0:35] uh 1 Corinthians chapter 10. And um just
[0:39] uh take for a little title, the book of
[0:42] correction. And uh so we'll start at 1
[0:45] Corinthians 10 um chapter verse one.
[0:51] which
[0:53] says, "Moreover,
[0:55] brethren, I would not that you should be
[0:58] ignorant how that all our fathers were
[1:00] under the cloud, and all passed through
[1:03] the sea, and were all baptized unto
[1:05] Moses in the cloud and in the sea, and
[1:08] did all eat the same spiritual meat, and
[1:11] did all drink the same spiritual drink.
[1:14] For they drank of that spiritual rock
[1:16] that followed them, and that rock was
[1:19] Christ.
[1:20] But with many of them, God was not well
[1:23] pleased, for they were overthrown in the
[1:26] wilderness. God bless you. You can take
[1:28] your
[1:31] seats. And
[1:33] uh you know, we've kind of been
[1:35] meditating on Corinthians and in our
[1:37] Sunday school lessons and things. And um
[1:40] just wanted to take a topic tonight to
[1:42] kind of dive into this and um and maybe
[1:45] maybe preach from it a little bit that
[1:47] um you know, brother Ram said that that
[1:49] Corinthians was uh it's it's a book of
[1:53] correction and um it's you know he
[1:56] talked he framed up how that Corinthian
[1:58] church was that they had a lot of a lot
[2:01] of problems and and he said that they
[2:03] were always in trouble and you know uh I
[2:07] I've got a friend that uh that said
[2:09] that, you know, sometimes you'll see
[2:10] people and that you're acquainted with
[2:12] or or you know, just, you know, in
[2:15] Walmart or whatever and you look at them
[2:16] in the way that they're acting and you
[2:18] think, well, nobody told them how
[2:20] they're supposed to do and and that's
[2:23] why we need correction. You look at, you
[2:26] know, children that are kind of running
[2:28] rampant at the at the playground and and
[2:30] and it's like their parent, where's
[2:32] their parents at? Nobody told them,
[2:34] nobody trained them how to act. And then
[2:36] that as you get older and older, if
[2:38] nobody tells you how to act and and and
[2:40] kind of gives you a little bit
[2:41] straightening out, then then you end up
[2:44] being a problem for society. And and so
[2:46] we we uh it's correction is good. And
[2:50] and you know that thank God that that
[2:51] God in the in the scripture he does just
[2:54] doesn't give us a just a a paddling for
[2:57] paddling's sake you know but he'll he
[2:58] actually frames it up so that we start
[3:02] we something you know when God gives us
[3:04] correction something within our heart
[3:06] starts yearning for God. It it it what
[3:09] it does is it frames up the way that we
[3:11] look at things so that we're we we know
[3:13] that there's something lacking in our
[3:15] lives and we know that there's there's
[3:17] we we we start looking toward the
[3:19] antidote. A you know like like a a
[3:21] parent sometimes when they they give
[3:23] their child a little spanking and and
[3:25] and what do they do that the little kid
[3:28] the little kid may be in diapers or
[3:29] whatever it'll it'll just turn right
[3:31] around and run right back to mom and
[3:33] daddy and run right back to mom and
[3:35] daddy's arms. And that's what God wants
[3:37] us to do when he when he gives us
[3:39] correction. Now, you'll see uh Paul's
[3:42] laying it out here in in in 1
[3:44] Corinthians 10, and we're going to read
[3:46] 1 Corinthians 13 a little bit as well,
[3:49] that he's framing it up to them so that
[3:51] they can understand that that there's a
[3:53] lot of things that you're you're you're
[3:54] putting your focus on that it's great,
[3:57] but but the real thing is, are you are
[4:00] you really born again? Now that's that's
[4:03] the question that Paul's trying to frame
[4:04] up to to the Corinthians here is are you
[4:07] putting all your focus on on on uh great
[4:11] many things a long list of things that
[4:13] are all good and everything but but are
[4:15] you are you really born again and uh he
[4:18] would say if we notice he couldn't teach
[4:20] the Corinthians deep things they were
[4:22] just a baby fashion they wasn't able to
[4:24] take it you know I I think one of the
[4:27] one of the most important spots on this
[4:29] chart that we have back here on the wall
[4:31] because, you know, we put so much
[4:33] emphasis maybe on on the headstone and
[4:36] and and and all the different things
[4:38] that go in with that, but you know,
[4:39] really, if you get right down to it, the
[4:41] most important thing, the most important
[4:43] part of it is right down at the bottom,
[4:45] right? Is just be born again. Be born
[4:48] again first because that will solve a
[4:50] whole lot of problems. If you're not
[4:52] born again, then you won't be able to
[4:54] hear the the gospel correctly. You won't
[4:56] be able to hear what the preacher's
[4:57] preaching correctly. It won't it won't
[4:59] mean what it will to you if you enter
[5:01] into the Holy of Holies and and are able
[5:04] to and and and and God changes your life
[5:07] and makes you opens up your eyes of
[5:10] understanding and opens up your ears so
[5:12] that you can comprehend and you know
[5:14] sometimes so so that's really you know
[5:16] one of the maybe the problems that some
[5:18] of the Corinthians had is is they were
[5:20] either a baby or they just wasn't born
[5:22] again yet and so they weren't able to
[5:25] take it. You know, sometimes God has to
[5:27] wait on us until we grow to a place
[5:29] where we can receive his blessings. Look
[5:32] at what the Corinthians were doing. They
[5:33] they you look at the situation that they
[5:35] were in that they were all they they had
[5:37] all this jealousy and comparison and
[5:40] envy and strife and division and and all
[5:43] those things all those problems laid out
[5:46] and and and then they started depending
[5:47] on little sensations and little things
[5:49] like that or maybe they somebody would
[5:51] say I had a I had a revelation come to
[5:53] me. Now, that's that's one of the maybe
[5:55] confusing things that Brother Brandon
[5:57] will say is he'll say even revelation
[5:59] because what we'll do is we'll say,
[6:00] "Well, I got a revelation that I'm
[6:02] supposed to do something or whatever.
[6:03] I've got a revelation about somebody.
[6:05] I've got some kind of a special
[6:06] revelation." But you can't use that as
[6:08] an evidence that that that that you are
[6:11] have a genuine experience with God. So
[6:13] the the Corinthians would they would
[6:15] say, "Well, I maybe one of them well I
[6:16] I've got some kind of a special
[6:18] revelation where God pulled me over to
[6:20] the side and told me something special
[6:21] about you or my situation or whatever
[6:24] and they were using that as an evidence
[6:27] or I've got a psalm or I've got a
[6:29] prophecy." But Paul said, now now here's
[6:31] the kicker. Paul said all these things
[6:35] will fail.
[6:37] All these things will fail. See, every
[6:40] one of them, Brother Brown would frame
[6:42] it up like he'd say they're just not to
[6:45] be trusted too much. Now, one of my
[6:48] favorite scriptures in the Bible is in
[6:50] second Peter chapter 1 where Peter says
[6:54] the same thing but in a different way.
[6:57] He said, he said, "This voice which came
[7:00] from heaven, we heard." In other words,
[7:01] I was on the Mount Transfiguration. I
[7:04] heard the voice from heaven speak out
[7:07] and say, "This is my beloved son. Hear
[7:10] ye him." I heard I was there. I saw
[7:13] Elijah and I saw Moses. I was I was up
[7:16] there when when we were with him in the
[7:19] Holy mount. But he said we now we you
[7:22] you can't use that as an evidence.
[7:25] That's what he's saying. You I can't use
[7:27] that as an evidence that I was there and
[7:29] I saw all these things. I can't use that
[7:32] as an evidence. But we have also a more
[7:35] sure word of prophecy where unto ye do
[7:38] well that ye take heed as unto a light
[7:41] that shineth in a dark place unto the
[7:44] day dawn and the day star arise in your
[7:47] hearts. Now now see there's scripture
[7:49] script the word of God made alive trumps
[7:52] any kind of an experience like that any
[7:55] goosebumps prophetic dreams private
[7:58] revelations that contradict scripture
[8:00] all that's got to be laid to the side. I
[8:03] and and and if it if it's at all
[8:07] contrary to the word of God,
[8:10] scripture trumps experience. But now
[8:12] there's the there's the balance. That
[8:14] don't mean you don't need an experience.
[8:16] Now, there's the thing. You can't base
[8:19] it on an experience, but we need an
[8:22] experience. Right? Now, tell me that's
[8:24] not confusing to preach. Oh, you can't
[8:26] base it on an experience, but you need
[8:28] an experience. You can't base it on your
[8:31] little a little one maybe a little one
[8:32] time think something happened. Well,
[8:34] even even maybe healing, you get healed
[8:36] of cancer or something and or healed of
[8:38] something amazing as many people did in
[8:41] brother Brandham's prayer lines and come
[8:42] out. I know that that man is is real
[8:45] that he's he's really led of God and God
[8:48] touched me and healed me. But yet down
[8:50] in your soul, something could still be
[8:53] lacking. Yeah. You can't base it on an
[8:56] experience, but you got to have an
[8:57] experience. And brother Ram said that's
[9:00] actually what the world is looking for
[9:02] is somebody with a real experience.
[9:04] Somebody that's real genuine. He said
[9:06] they don't care how good we educate our
[9:07] preachers. They're wanting to see
[9:09] reality. Reality is a real a real nature
[9:13] change where somebody that's walking out
[9:15] in the world that they don't have to
[9:16] tell lies to get by. They don't have to
[9:19] go steal a stapler out of the out of the
[9:21] workroom or something to get by. They
[9:22] don't have to go finagle their way. I
[9:24] was actually talking to my wife today
[9:26] about a situation where, you know, the
[9:28] world the world probably could get by
[9:30] with telling a lie and get some more
[9:33] money in their bank account, but not me.
[9:36] Not me even if I can't get by can get by
[9:38] with it. I because what the world needs
[9:40] to see something genuine, something
[9:43] real, right? And he said then then
[9:46] they've got an experience if there is a
[9:48] reality.
[9:50] That's what we need, an experience. Now,
[9:53] the experience that I'm I'm trying to
[9:54] explain here is an experience like what
[9:57] we've got here on the on the on the wall
[9:59] back here, an experience where you're
[10:01] born again, experience where you begin
[10:04] to see God changing you and he takes you
[10:06] from point A to point B and it might
[10:09] might be, you know, 10, 15, 20 years
[10:12] along and along you look back and and
[10:14] before long you're identifying yourself
[10:17] with the same journey that Abraham went
[10:20] on. Abraham hanging on in faith, not
[10:23] knowing when that baby was going to get
[10:25] here, but yet he's moving on, watching
[10:27] God slowly transform his life to where
[10:30] the little bitty things that he used to
[10:32] not be able to hang on to. Now, now he's
[10:35] got more that that little bit of
[10:36] snowball faith has snowballed up into a
[10:39] great mountainiz faith and he's able to
[10:41] believe for the impossible. Amen. Now,
[10:43] now what's an experience? An experience
[10:45] is a personal lived event or encounter
[10:49] that leaves a distinct impression on
[10:51] your mind, emotions or memor memory. It
[10:54] involves direct participation or
[10:56] observation, not just knowledge or
[10:59] theory. It's something that you live
[11:02] through. Something that you live
[11:04] through. You you were there. And that's
[11:07] why it's hard to convey to somebody else
[11:09] your experience. I've had this this
[11:11] problem myself. You you tell somebody an
[11:14] experience that you live through where
[11:15] God did something for you and it just
[11:17] doesn't resonate to them because they
[11:19] were there. I I went through it. I saw
[11:22] God get me out of this situation. But
[11:24] you tell somebody about it and well it
[11:26] just you know it seems like they just
[11:29] don't they just don't understand and
[11:31] they don't understand cuz it's my
[11:34] experience and it's your experience. If
[11:36] you've had an experience, I it it's
[11:39] something that you directly went
[11:41] through, something you yourself went
[11:43] through where where you know that God
[11:46] came on the scene and did something for
[11:48] you. And and nobody can take that away
[11:51] from you. The devil can't take it away.
[11:54] Your friends, your parents, any your
[11:56] your buddy sitting on the pew next to
[11:57] you, nobody can take that away from you
[11:59] because you know that you were there
[12:02] when it happened. Amen. But right
[12:05] salvation is not based on experience
[12:08] right because people can have any kind
[12:10] of an experience. Brother Brown said the
[12:12] Mohamadas have experiences the Buddhists
[12:15] have an experience and every different
[12:18] religion has experiences and neither can
[12:20] salvation be based upon fasting, prayer
[12:23] experiences, sensations or sincerity.
[12:26] Salvation cannot be based upon any
[12:28] church or any creed. Nothing but the
[12:31] word of God. for it's God's word. Now
[12:36] listen, you can have an experience and
[12:38] your heart not be right. But when you
[12:41] when your heart receives the word of
[12:43] God, it will affect an experience in
[12:46] your life. So you got to have an
[12:48] experience. The word will produce an
[12:51] experience. But experience itself is not
[12:53] the proof. What is it? The proof is a
[12:56] life that is lived by the word. It's a
[12:59] life that it matches up with the word.
[13:01] your life matches up. It agrees with the
[13:03] word cuz the word is grabbing a hold of
[13:05] you and it starts changing you to live
[13:08] out what is there on the page. That's
[13:11] why the new birth is not knowledge or
[13:13] it's not theory. It's not just something
[13:15] that you learn about. But it's the
[13:17] person of Jesus Christ manifested in
[13:19] your life. And brother Ram was saying
[13:22] you must be born again. He said the true
[13:23] word comes to the true prophet and he
[13:26] tells you the true word. You follow that
[13:28] true word and you get a true experience
[13:30] of the word because the word is made
[13:33] flesh in you and you become God's son
[13:36] and the word of God is revolving right
[13:39] out of God into you because you are of
[13:44] his nature. His spirit is in you and
[13:49] you'll do the works of
[13:51] God. Hallelujah. The Bible said so. Oh
[13:55] my. Now there there we've got what
[13:57] Christianity really is. It's not
[14:00] legalism where we're coming to church
[14:01] and we're judging one another and if you
[14:03] don't tally up to my list of rules then
[14:06] then you're out and all of those things.
[14:08] But what it is is the word of God sewn
[14:11] into a repented heart. Good old tealed
[14:14] up ground where the word of God can
[14:15] spring forth and it starts moving up
[14:18] like a lily through the mud to change
[14:20] you to make you to make you different.
[14:22] And then that's what proves. He said
[14:24] your faith does it and then your life
[14:27] proves whether you received it or
[14:32] not. So something happening is not an
[14:35] evidence. But when your life is
[14:37] scripturally identified with the word
[14:39] and you've experienced a journey of
[14:41] faith that identifies with the word that
[14:44] is the evidence.
[14:47] Brother Rand would say, he said, "I
[14:49] think it's great when you got a people
[14:51] that you can teach deep things." Now,
[14:54] that's great when you got somebody that
[14:57] they've heard the word and it and and
[15:00] maybe not all the word. You know, that
[15:02] that's the question that comes up to, do
[15:04] I have to know everything in the Bible
[15:06] to be born again? No. No. Just take just
[15:10] take one little scripture. Just take
[15:12] that promise there in Acts chapter 2.
[15:14] Repent and be baptized in the name of
[15:16] the Lord Jesus a and and the promises to
[15:19] you and you start just meditating on
[15:22] that. Well, okay, what's the name of
[15:23] Jesus? What does this mean to go down in
[15:26] the water? You start meditating on that
[15:27] and it will start to have an effect on
[15:29] your life and you'll start moving in
[15:31] that direction. How do you get born
[15:33] again? You just you just put your foot
[15:35] out like Peter stepping out of that
[15:36] boat. Put your feet out on the water and
[15:38] just start walking to the promise and
[15:40] watch God to work in your life. Amen.
[15:44] I think it's great, brother said, when
[15:45] you got a people that you can teach deep
[15:47] things and the Holy Spirit can wind
[15:49] these great truths and anchor it into
[15:52] the into the people's hearts so they
[15:55] know where they are standing. Sensation
[15:59] or no sensation, prophecy or no
[16:03] prophecy, and whatever it might be. Now,
[16:07] there's something
[16:08] great when you can sit on Job's ashy and
[16:11] all your friends are gone and
[16:14] everybody's gone away from you and
[16:16] there's no sensation. There's no great
[16:18] prayer meeting or anything go, you know,
[16:20] any great supernatural outpouring, no
[16:23] clouds or angels, but yet you
[16:26] know, you know where you're standing,
[16:29] right? Right. You have an anchor.
[16:32] Now, that's what we're talking about
[16:34] tonight.
[16:36] down in your soul. Your spirit can be
[16:38] all tore up with things of life and and
[16:40] worry and wondering all these different
[16:42] things. Your spirit, that's what we're
[16:44] trying to as we grow up, the stature of
[16:46] a perfect man. We're trying to get our
[16:47] spirit lined up. But down in your soul,
[16:50] faith rest in the soul. And my soul
[16:54] feeds only on the word of God. And
[16:57] that's why I got to have the word of God
[16:58] because that's what gives me strength.
[17:00] Amen. Amen. My soul feeds on the word of
[17:03] God. And that's where that's where my
[17:05] nature is. My soul my soul is the nature
[17:08] of the spirit. So that's that's why
[17:10] that's why a born again believer acts
[17:13] the way they do because they've had a
[17:15] nature change. Their nature is the
[17:17] nature of Christ because your soul has
[17:20] been changed to be like Christ. Amen.
[17:22] Now that's why that's why over in 1
[17:24] Corinthians 13:8 in chapter 13 of 1
[17:28] Corinthians we start reading as Paul
[17:31] explains he says charity charity never
[17:35] faileth charity don't never it will
[17:38] never fail
[17:40] charity love down in your soul love
[17:44] that's not just something that you read
[17:45] about but something the real essence of
[17:47] love agapo love charity never faileth
[17:51] but whether there be prophecies, they'll
[17:53] fail. Now, think about how profound that
[17:56] is. Somebody stood up in church and
[17:59] could could prophesy about something
[18:01] that will happen to you on the way home
[18:03] tonight and yet there might be something
[18:06] wrong in their soul. That's not the
[18:07] evidence just because of something
[18:09] supernatural happened. But whether there
[18:11] be prophecies, they shall fail. Whether
[18:13] there be tongues, they shall cease.
[18:14] Whether there be knowledge, it shall
[18:16] vanish away. See, it's not just about
[18:18] accumulating knowledge.
[18:22] It's not just about accumulating
[18:25] knowledge. Brother Rama said all these
[18:27] sensations that those Corinthians had,
[18:29] not one of them was a evidence that they
[18:32] were
[18:33] saved. Not one of them was was an
[18:35] evidence that they were saved. Not if
[18:38] you could shout, if you could prophesy,
[18:40] if you could heal the sick, if you could
[18:41] speak with tongues, if you could
[18:43] interpret tongues, if you had wisdom, if
[18:45] you had knowledge, none of those mean
[18:47] you're saved. Not a one of them. Now,
[18:48] how many things could we add to the
[18:50] list? Because I do this, because this
[18:52] happens, because this happened, because
[18:54] but it it's not an evidence. He said,
[18:56] you could have every one of them, Paul
[18:58] said, and be lost. I am nothing.
[19:04] Now, there's that question, you know,
[19:06] that that people are going to ask at the
[19:07] white throne judgment that that Jesus
[19:09] framed up in Matthew chapter 7 when he
[19:11] said, "Many will say to me in that day,
[19:13] Lord, Lord, have have we not prophesied
[19:15] in thy name? I I preached in your name.
[19:18] I cast out devils and in thy name cast
[19:22] out devils and in thy name done many
[19:23] wonderful works. And then will I profess
[19:25] unto them, I never knew you. Depart from
[19:29] me, ye that work
[19:33] iniquity. But when you got love, the
[19:37] person that's an anchor. Now this love
[19:40] that Paul's talking about, charity,
[19:42] charity, charity never never faileth.
[19:44] Love is, you know, in in the Greek
[19:46] there's there's different tenses of that
[19:48] word agapo. Agapo is the
[19:52] uh agapo is the is the verb. It means
[19:55] like to love
[19:57] sacrificially. Jesus loved till he laid
[19:59] everything down on the cross. He just to
[20:01] love sacrificially. But the word
[20:04] agape is the noun, the essence of the
[20:07] thing. And that's what Paul is talking
[20:09] about. And what agape is that it's going
[20:12] to be patient and kind. It's going to
[20:15] always behave
[20:17] decently, seek other people's gain, stay
[20:20] stay, you know, cool in a situation.
[20:23] It's going to delight in truth. It will
[20:26] be able to bear all things. It'll always
[20:29] believe the best, hope the best, endure
[20:31] the worst. And that's that's something.
[20:35] Believe the best and endure the worst.
[20:38] And that kind of love will never fail.
[20:41] It'll outlast any kind of a gift,
[20:44] miracle, knowledge. It will it will
[20:46] outlast all of those things. But what it
[20:49] won't do is it's not
[20:52] envious. It's not boastful. It's not
[20:54] proud. It's never rude. It's not
[20:58] self-absorbed. It's not easily provoked.
[21:01] It It doesn't keep a scorecard of
[21:03] wrongs. Agapo love doesn't have a list.
[21:06] It's not a list keeper. and and it never
[21:09] celebrates
[21:11] injustice. a love love and and and
[21:15] brother Brown will say thought maybe if
[21:17] we could get this warning to the people
[21:18] as war Paul was warning these
[21:20] Corinthians if we can get this warning
[21:22] to the people knowing that we're facing
[21:24] a revival now an examinating time when
[21:28] we must be
[21:30] examined you know sometimes it's good to
[21:32] examine oursel I was thinking uh tonight
[21:35] just riding up the road that you know
[21:38] I'm I'm getting older you know you look
[21:40] back and now I'm a grandparent I got to
[21:43] throw that in there. Y'all know that. I
[21:44] got to throw that. I'm a grandparent.
[21:47] But where did the time go? Just just
[21:50] just yesterday I was graduating high
[21:52] school. Just yesterday I was getting
[21:54] married. And and life is such a short
[21:56] little span, right? And you only have
[21:59] just one chance to give your heart for
[22:03] Christ. Yeah. You only got one chance.
[22:06] And brother Brandham when he was
[22:08] preaching, he would narrow it down even
[22:10] further that you don't you don't know
[22:11] what's going to happen tonight when you
[22:13] go home. You might get an accident on
[22:16] the way home. You might hit a chicken
[22:19] truck or something. We don't know. God
[22:21] forbid. But you don't know how much time
[22:24] you have left on this earth. And so
[22:26] every little moment counts. If you
[22:29] haven't given your heart to God, then
[22:32] don't wait. Don't waste time. Amen.
[22:36] Amen. Because every little moment
[22:38] counts. And you'll look back and I heard
[22:42] I heard somebody say, this is kind of a
[22:45] a bad thing to say that some people look
[22:47] back on their life at the end of their
[22:48] journey and they realize that it didn't
[22:50] ever amount to nothing. But well, you
[22:52] know, that would be true if if your
[22:55] whole life was wasted and you never gave
[22:57] your heart to God after a whole life.
[23:00] Your whole life goes by and you never
[23:03] surrendered your heart to God.
[23:05] What a waste. What a waste. And that's
[23:08] why Brother Brandon would make those
[23:10] statements that seem harsh to people
[23:12] that, you know, they're a an ill-famed
[23:14] woman or whatever is not worth a bullet
[23:16] to shoot her with. But why? Because your
[23:18] your life is a waste. If you don't give
[23:21] your heart to God, then your life ends
[23:23] up being like just just sand blowing on
[23:25] on the desert just blowing by.
[23:29] And and Paul would say in 1 Corinthians
[23:31] chapter 10, he'd say, "Moreover,
[23:33] brethren," if we continue reading,
[23:35] "Moreover, brethren, I would not that
[23:37] you should be ignorant. How that all our
[23:40] fathers were under the
[23:42] cloud." All our fathers were under the
[23:45] cloud, and all passed through the sea,
[23:47] and were baptized unto Moses and the
[23:49] cloud and in the sea. And brother Ram
[23:52] would say, we find on down a little
[23:53] farther in our lesson that many of those
[23:55] were overthrowed because they could do
[23:57] all the rituals and all the orders and
[24:00] everything that God required and still
[24:03] their hearts wasn't right with God. Now,
[24:06] what's Paul trying to express to the
[24:09] Corinthians? You're going to church and
[24:11] and you're doing you're you have the
[24:13] same maybe testimony as the people that
[24:15] followed Moses, but are you born again?
[24:19] Are you born again? Now, I know I know a
[24:22] lot of preachers kind of shy away from
[24:24] preaching like this, but I'mma do it.
[24:26] I'm I'm going to go ahead and say you've
[24:28] been here at Lula for for decades, maybe
[24:31] for years and years, and no matter where
[24:33] you are, whether you're a child or an
[24:35] adult or
[24:36] whatever, what however you regard the
[24:39] message or whatever, are you born again?
[24:43] Are are you sure that you're born again?
[24:46] because he's saying that, you know, the
[24:48] hardest thing to get somebody to see is
[24:50] that there's something wrong with with
[24:53] their life, with their position. And
[24:55] that's why we've got the mirror of God's
[24:57] word, that we can look in the mirror of
[24:59] God's word and compare our life and
[25:01] compare our nature and compare our walk
[25:03] and see if the way that we are agrees
[25:07] with what the word says we should be.
[25:10] Because if we're not, if we don't match
[25:13] up with it, then it's shaken up time.
[25:15] It's examination time. As brother
[25:18] Brandham said, it's time to examine
[25:20] ourselves and see, do we really compare
[25:23] where the word the word says we should
[25:25] be? And he said, now we can do many
[25:28] things. We can take communion. We could
[25:30] be baptized. We can come to church, have
[25:32] our names on the book, or be just as
[25:34] respect and reverent as we can be, and
[25:38] still be
[25:39] lost. That's a solemn warning.
[25:43] We could be just rejoice when the spirit
[25:45] would fall and in a meeting where the
[25:47] word was being preached and our souls
[25:49] would just rejoice with the
[25:51] word and still be
[25:54] lost. My goodness, that ought to make
[25:58] anybody's head almost explode that you
[26:01] can sit in a meeting where the word is
[26:03] being preached and rejoice at the word
[26:06] being preached. Rejoice at a good
[26:08] oldfashioned camp meeting. rejoice at a
[26:11] special meeting and still be lost
[26:14] because the rain falls on the just and
[26:16] the unjust. The same rain that makes the
[26:18] wheat grow makes the weed grow. Now,
[26:21] here's the thing.
[26:24] It's the nature of the product.
[26:28] See, he asked that question.
[26:30] See, it's the nature of it that tells
[26:35] what we are. Therefore, it's the nature
[26:38] in us that tells what we are. You ever
[26:43] wonder maybe if if you know Abel's
[26:45] watching Cain and and and and you know
[26:48] along and along God begins to speak to
[26:50] him that it's blood. Why is it blood?
[26:52] Because blood is the life and in the
[26:55] blood is the nature and the life is the
[26:57] nature. the life whether you know if
[26:59] it's a it's if it's a a a pine tree is
[27:02] going to look like the life of the pine
[27:04] tree is going to make pine pine needles
[27:06] and so forth. If it's the life of an oak
[27:08] tree, it's going to look like an oak
[27:10] tree. It's going to be the nature of an
[27:11] oak tree. It's going to whatever the
[27:13] life is. Maybe maybe Abel's looking at
[27:16] Cain and wondering why do you act like
[27:19] that? It's the nature. It goes all the
[27:21] way back to the nature. Brother Brham
[27:22] would actually say this. He said, "First
[27:24] you were mean and evil and hatred and
[27:26] malice and strife. Now though you're
[27:30] loving, you're sweet and you're kind."
[27:32] And see the difference. It's your
[27:34] nature. We could I I'll call it that.
[27:37] It's your soul that's been changed.
[27:40] Amen. The old soul died and the new
[27:43] soul, which is the new nature, was born
[27:45] into you. Now, he's not talking about
[27:47] the person of your being dying, but he's
[27:50] talking about that old nature. Your
[27:52] nature changed and now that nature is
[27:54] gone. A person will have a nature like
[27:57] all those lists that Paul has of of
[27:59] malice and gile and hypocrisies and
[28:01] envys and evil speakings, debates and
[28:04] envings and wraths and strifes and
[28:06] backbitings and whisperings and
[28:08] swellings and tumults and all those
[28:10] things that Paul lays out. But then God
[28:12] can take those those two tables of stone
[28:15] like he wrote out with Moses and put
[28:17] them in your heart. And then those two
[28:20] tables of stone, what was written out on
[28:22] stone, now it's lived out in you. And it
[28:25] changes you. Changes you to honor your
[28:28] father and mother, changes you to put
[28:30] God before everything else. Changes you
[28:32] so you don't lie and steal and hate.
[28:35] Changes you. And Revelation chapter 4,
[28:37] he said, "If you'll get the word soul
[28:38] and look it
[28:40] up, it'll tell you in the Bible
[28:42] dictionary or Webster, any any of them,
[28:44] it is the nature of the spirit.
[28:49] Now here's a man we say here's John Doe.
[28:52] Now John Doe is a man body. He's a
[28:54] brother to James Doe to Sam Do. Now John
[28:58] is a spirit soul body. And Samo is the
[29:02] same thing. Now this man is evil, mean,
[29:06] cheat, steal, lie, commit adultery, any
[29:08] evil thing that he can do. But this man
[29:12] is full of love, peace, joy. They're
[29:16] both got soul, body, and spirit. Well,
[29:20] what's the
[29:21] difference? This man can go back and
[29:24] say, "I remember my mama. I remember
[29:26] things that we done when we was boys."
[29:29] Both of them can. Just like Cain and
[29:31] Abel, just like Jacob and Esau, just all
[29:35] the way down. They both got experiences
[29:38] where they were raised up the same way.
[29:40] They both got spirits. They both got
[29:42] souls. They both got body. But the
[29:45] nature of this man's spirit is evil. The
[29:49] nature of this man's spirit is good.
[29:53] See? So the nature of the spirit is the
[29:56] soul of man. See? So now God is trying
[29:59] in to get into the what? The spirit and
[30:02] the heart of man. Where the spirit lays
[30:05] is in the
[30:08] heart down in your heart. down deep
[30:11] within your inner
[30:13] essence is is where all where the way
[30:16] you act comes from. The way you are
[30:19] comes from your soul. Your soul that way
[30:22] down under the surface that you can't
[30:24] you can't you know it's it's just buried
[30:27] but that's what's controlling the way
[30:28] that you are and that God can change
[30:30] that. You know, brother would tell that
[30:33] story about how that I think it was
[30:35] Matson and Bose's daughter came in with
[30:37] an article that that said that science
[30:40] had discovered that there was a a
[30:43] chamber in the heart of a man that was
[30:46] like a little reservation spot. You
[30:49] know, if you go uh get a hotel when
[30:52] you're traveling somewhere, you make a
[30:54] reservation. Well, you know, it's like
[30:56] God making a reservation. to think to
[30:59] think that there's a spot in your heart
[31:01] for God to come and
[31:03] dwell. Now, you can argue all day long
[31:06] about whether science can actually prove
[31:08] that or not. All I'm saying is that
[31:10] brother Ram said that there was an
[31:12] article that said that there was a a
[31:14] spot in your in your heart. Now, there's
[31:16] a heart there sure is a spot in your in
[31:19] your heart for God to come and dwell in
[31:21] you and to change you and to make you
[31:23] like him. He said, "Now, we might be so
[31:26] religious till we wouldn't turn our
[31:28] hands on Sunday to do a thing. We might
[31:32] not even take a stitch in our clothes on
[31:34] Sunday. We might not even feel justified
[31:37] to buy food on Sunday. We might be so
[31:39] religious and so pious, but yet if we
[31:42] are not literally born again of the
[31:45] spirit of God, we're just worshiping in
[31:48] vain." Yes. You know, he told that story
[31:51] of those two men that he tell he told
[31:53] that story so many times of the two men
[31:55] at that Pentecostal camp meeting where
[31:57] they were both prophesying and
[31:59] interpreting, but yet one of them had
[32:01] something wrong in his soul. He said,
[32:03] "When I got a chance on the outside to
[32:05] talk to one of them and could tell what
[32:06] he was made from, there was one as evil
[32:10] as could be. Something was wrong with
[32:13] his nature.
[32:15] But yet in his spirit and externals, he
[32:20] was prophesying, interpreting, and it
[32:22] was the genuine spirit of God.
[32:26] You know, to think that somebody could
[32:28] taste the grapes of the promised land
[32:30] like they the Israelites there at Kadesh
[32:32] Barnea and and see the evidence that the
[32:35] message of the hour is true, that the
[32:37] gospel is true, and then then turn back
[32:39] out of fear and or or or maybe just
[32:41] afraid to to go on and and afraid that
[32:44] God will actually do what he says he
[32:46] does. The Bible says for somebody to do
[32:49] that, to taste like they did at Kadesh
[32:52] Barnea, to taste, to see that the
[32:55] supernatural God is actually working
[32:58] through this prophet's message, to see
[33:00] that God is actually he he's actually
[33:03] fulfilling his signs and wonders that he
[33:05] spoke of in the scripture to to taste of
[33:08] it and then turn back. It's impossible.
[33:11] Like Paul said, it's impossible for
[33:13] those who were once enlightened and have
[33:15] t tasted of the heavenly gift and were
[33:18] made partakers of the Holy Ghost and
[33:20] have tasted the good word of God and the
[33:22] powers of the world to come, if they
[33:23] shall fall away to renew them again
[33:25] under repentance, seeing they crucify to
[33:28] themselves the son of God aresh and put
[33:31] him to an open shame. It's impossible
[33:33] for you to taste to to come and and
[33:37] fellowship with believers and see the
[33:39] spirit of God moving and see that God is
[33:41] real. To see that he's true and that he
[33:43] keeps his word. He keeps it to others to
[33:46] taste that and then to turn around and
[33:48] go back and say, "I I don't believe it."
[33:52] To to make that decision like they did
[33:54] there at Kadesh Barnea, God is not able
[33:57] to deliver us of the giants.
[34:00] You might have giants tonight, but to
[34:02] turn around and say, "Well, I I don't
[34:04] believe that he's able to do it in the
[34:06] way that they did there at Kadesh
[34:08] Barnea." In other words, say it like
[34:10] this. If you've been enlightened and
[34:12] then turn away from your enlightenment,
[34:14] if you can see God moving and then turn
[34:16] away, it is impossible for you to ever
[34:19] regain your place again.
[34:22] Don't linger on the edge and turn away
[34:25] because you'll only get true security by
[34:27] coming all the way in. Right. Right. But
[34:30] you know on the flip side, it is
[34:33] absolutely impossible, Brother Brandham
[34:35] said, for a man that has received the
[34:38] Holy Spirit to ever fall away. Right
[34:42] now, what about that? It's impossible if
[34:45] you have received the Holy Ghost. It's
[34:47] impossible for you to fall away. You
[34:51] cannot fall away if you have received a
[34:54] genuine experience of the new birth.
[34:57] Why? because his life has come in you.
[34:59] His life has taken hold. It's taken root
[35:02] and and he's claimed you for himself.
[35:04] And so it's impossible. It's impossible
[35:07] for you to ever be lost. Amen. Amen.
[35:11] Brother Brown was he saw that that that
[35:13] vision of the of the earth turning and
[35:15] and and one, you know, dressed in white
[35:18] going and sewing seas and that one dark,
[35:21] you know, clothed in darkness coming
[35:23] behind him sewing seeds. And he always
[35:25] he wondered he you know what what's
[35:27] going on here and he said then I
[35:30] understood when God revealed it to him
[35:32] the Holy Spirit will fall but by their
[35:34] fruits they are known said the Lord
[35:36] Jesus not by the reaction of the spirit
[35:40] whether they heal the sick or whether
[35:42] they speak in tongues or whether they
[35:43] sang in the spirit or whether they
[35:45] rejoice this way or that they can do all
[35:48] that and still be lost. It's your life
[35:51] within you. A born again experience.
[35:55] Amen. What What do we What's the
[35:57] takeaway from that vision is that one
[35:59] swed good seed and it grew and grew and
[36:02] grew until finally the fruit was
[36:04] manifested. And there it is. The fruit
[36:07] tells what it is. And then on the other
[36:10] side that the the the the weeds the the
[36:13] the seeds of weeds were planted until
[36:15] they grew and grew and grew and grew and
[36:18] and you open it up, crack open looking
[36:20] for that little pit bit of wheat.
[36:22] Where's it at? It it's not there. And so
[36:24] that shows that it ain't the real
[36:27] genuine. It's the life that bears forth.
[36:29] Now, now see, you'll think maybe this is
[36:31] maybe a little bit not too deep, but
[36:34] this has something to do with the seals
[36:36] because I tell you what's going to give
[36:38] you rapturing faith. What's going to
[36:40] give you faith to step out of this
[36:41] mortal realm is when you see your life
[36:44] bearing forth exactly the same thing
[36:46] that the word says it would bear forth
[36:49] in this day. It's the life in the bride.
[36:52] It's the same token life. Well, that's
[36:54] why brother Ram preached that sermon,
[36:56] the token. The token's got to come in
[36:58] the evening time. Now, at the at the end
[37:00] of the journey, at the this kind of
[37:02] token, there's a token that that comes
[37:04] when you're born again to really show
[37:06] that you're a real born again child of
[37:08] God. But there's an end time token that
[37:11] shows that the same life that was in the
[37:13] son of man is now in his bride. It's the
[37:16] same life being restored back.
[37:19] Now that's why in 1 Corinthians chapter
[37:21] 10, Paul would say, "Moreover, brethren,
[37:24] I would not that ye should be
[37:26] ignorant. How that all our fathers were
[37:29] under the cloud and all passed through
[37:32] the seat." You know, there was a time
[37:33] for ignorance. There was a time when
[37:36] when Christ was there on the mercy seat
[37:39] at our ignorance, atoning for all the
[37:42] little dots and and little little gaps
[37:45] in our understanding that well, why do
[37:47] you believe in a trinity? Well, I I'm
[37:49] just ignorant. You know, Martin Luther,
[37:51] John Wesley, they just didn't know. And
[37:53] so, God is atoning for their ignorance.
[37:55] But then here at the end time when he
[37:57] comes forth with the book in his hand,
[37:59] well, there ain't nobody ignorant
[38:01] anymore. You can look around the world
[38:03] and see that nobody's ignorant. What has
[38:05] turned into now? They're blind. Nobody's
[38:08] ignorant anymore. They're just blind.
[38:10] There it has been changed. Something's
[38:13] been changed spiritually to ignorance
[38:15] for to blindness. people willfully blind
[38:18] because they can see. You tell me
[38:19] somebody's not blind where you can see
[38:21] the evidence of the Holy Ghost moving
[38:24] and lies changing people and they're
[38:26] they're blind because they can't see it.
[38:28] Blindness.
[38:31] We're all baptized into Moses and the
[38:33] cloud and then the sea and all eat the
[38:35] same spiritual meat and all drink the
[38:38] same spiritual drink for they drank of
[38:41] that spiritual rock that followed them.
[38:43] And that rock was Christ. And brother
[38:46] Brandon would say, "This is not just
[38:48] little kid stuff. This is
[38:51] deep. Christianity is not just to be a
[38:53] little like, well, I'll go over to
[38:55] church and I know it's my duty to go."
[38:58] That's not Christianity.
[39:01] Christianity is something that God has
[39:05] done.
[39:06] Christianity is something that God has
[39:08] done.
[39:10] What's he speaking of? All these eating
[39:12] the same spiritual meat and drinking the
[39:14] same spiritual drink. He's speaking of
[39:16] the rituals of the church like like Paul
[39:19] was talking about in Hebrews chapter
[39:20] nine when he said, "How much more shall
[39:22] the blood of Christ who through the
[39:23] eternal spirit offered himself without
[39:25] spot to God purge your conscience from
[39:28] dead works to serve the living God."
[39:33] That God can take you from dead works
[39:35] just going through the rituals and the
[39:37] motions to serve a living God. A living
[39:41] God. They come in and was baptized into
[39:43] Christ. Brother say took on Christ
[39:45] outwardly professionally had taken him
[39:48] on intellectually had accepted him. But
[39:52] brother it's a lot more than
[39:54] intellectuals. It goes beyond that. He
[39:58] said they all took communion. They all
[40:00] follow that same spirit being the cloud
[40:02] and the pillar of fire. They all were
[40:04] led by the same angel. They all come out
[40:07] by the same pastor. They all was
[40:09] baptized in into the sea. But it isn't
[40:13] something to be played with. It isn't
[40:16] just going to church.
[40:19] He said, "Oh, you know, I I know I'm
[40:21] saved. Hallelujah. I shout in the
[40:23] spirit. I feel this." That doesn't have
[40:25] one thing to do with it. And he asked
[40:28] this question. You see how we base our
[40:30] eternal destination upon a sensation?
[40:34] That's why Paul in 1 Corinthians chapter
[40:37] 13 that we're we're trying to get to in
[40:40] our Sunday school lesson said this.
[40:43] Though I speak with the tongues of men
[40:46] and of angels and have not charity, I am
[40:50] become as sounding brass or a tinkling
[40:54] symbol.
[40:57] And though I have the gift of prophecy
[40:59] and understand all mysteries and all
[41:02] knowledge and though I have all faith so
[41:05] that I could remove mountains and have
[41:08] not charity, I am nothing. What's he
[41:11] saying? Though though I understand every
[41:13] m and I'm I'm quoting from brother Dale
[41:16] when he used to talk about when he
[41:17] preached on the seven seals. I can
[41:19] understand all technically all the seven
[41:21] seals but it if it's not lived right and
[41:25] that's why there's a different a
[41:27] difference between the seals and the
[41:29] thunders. The thunders are the
[41:30] revelation of the seals.
[41:34] I'm going stop right there. I have the
[41:37] gift of prophecy and understand all
[41:39] mysteries and all knowledge. All
[41:41] knowledge. You could have all knowledge.
[41:43] You could understand every technical
[41:45] thing but without charity without it
[41:48] alive in you without it alive
[41:53] I am
[41:54] nothing. In verse three he said though I
[41:56] bestow all my goods to feed the poor and
[41:58] though I give my body to be burned and
[42:00] have not charity it profitth me nothing.
[42:05] Brother Brandham will say, "All your
[42:06] good works, all your good deeds, all the
[42:08] spiritual things you have, all the gifts
[42:10] you have, all the sensations you have,
[42:12] all the joy you have, all the peace you
[42:14] have, has nothing to do at all to do
[42:17] with it to begin with." In verse four, 1
[42:21] Corinthians 13, he said, "Charity
[42:22] suffereth long and is kind. Charity
[42:25] envieth not. Charity voneth not itself.
[42:28] Is not puffed up. doth not behave itself
[42:32] unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not
[42:36] easily provoked, thinkketh no evil. Why?
[42:39] Because charity is agile love. And agile
[42:42] love is sacrificial. And that only comes
[42:45] from a nature change. That's the nature
[42:48] of Christ. That's the same nature of
[42:50] Christ there on the cross when he when
[42:52] he gave everything everything for you
[42:54] and I.
[42:58] Paul said, "And date all d drank the
[43:00] same spiritual drink. They drank of that
[43:03] spiritual rock that followed them and
[43:06] that rock was
[43:07] Christ. He said the man of the food
[43:10] which is the word that come from God out
[43:12] of heaven. Christ is the word and we eat
[43:14] the word. We set like in the message
[43:15] this morning. We listen our souls
[43:17] reaching grab that word. We live by the
[43:20] word. But if your life doesn't tally up
[43:23] to God's word, then it's time for a get
[43:26] right with God. Amen.
[43:30] It's time for a get right with
[43:33] God. And we'll stop on this scripture.
[43:36] With many of them, God was not well
[43:39] pleased. For they were overthrown in the
[43:44] wilderness. What happened? Brother Ram
[43:46] said, "It's because people are unstable
[43:48] on the word of God." Don't the Bible
[43:50] said they go from the east, from the
[43:52] west, from the north, and the south.
[43:53] There'd be a famine not for bread and
[43:55] water alone, but for the hearing of the
[43:57] word of God. What a day that we're
[44:00] living in. Well, it's a day when people
[44:02] have gone from ignorance to blindness. A
[44:06] a a day when people have gone to where
[44:08] they the gospel is preached, but yet
[44:11] they cannot hear in their ear. They've
[44:13] got an all in their ear that prevents
[44:15] them from hearing because they've
[44:16] rejected it. to to think what a sad
[44:19] situation that is where where most of
[44:21] the world can can hear the gospel
[44:24] preached on street corners and in
[44:26] different places and churches and it's
[44:27] all over the internet now and they just
[44:29] cannot hear it because there's a famine
[44:32] in the land for the hearing of the word.
[44:34] But thank God if we can hear it. Amen.
[44:37] If you can hear the gospel preached and
[44:38] and you recognize what what it is and
[44:41] what it's done to you and you can see
[44:42] that God has brought you through an
[44:44] experience and you look back and see the
[44:46] seals open to reveal the experience of
[44:48] your life. Oh, that's what Amos chapter
[44:52] 8 verse 11 says. Behold the days come,
[44:54] sayaeth the Lord God, that I will send a
[44:56] famine in the land, not a famine of
[44:58] bread, nor a thirst for water, but of
[45:01] hearing the words of the Lord. But the
[45:03] word will produce a new life. It'll
[45:06] produce life that bears the fruit of the
[45:08] Holy Spirit, love, joy, peace,
[45:11] longsuffering, kindness, faith, all
[45:14] those things. And it always agrees with
[45:17] and acts on all the word of God. Amen.
[45:20] Now, there's you an evidence that a
[45:22] nature change will make your life agree
[45:25] with the word. Amen. It'll make your
[45:27] your your motives and objectives line up
[45:30] with the word, and it will it will begin
[45:32] to change even the way that you think.
[45:35] Because charity charity is a person.
[45:38] It's the nature of Christ. As you as the
[45:40] musicians come forward, I I just want to
[45:42] ask this question. Have you received his
[45:44] life? I I I mean genuinely really really
[45:48] received it and not just to hope so or
[45:50] maybe but have you really come to a
[45:53] place where you know that you are
[45:54] anchored that you know that you know
[45:57] that you know because if you haven't
[45:59] don't don't leave this building
[46:02] until don't don't leave this building
[46:05] until you're
[46:07] sure. If you really if you really don't
[46:10] know it's time to get serious with God.
[46:13] You know, it's almost like, you know, we
[46:15] we can see all the all the things of the
[46:17] economy happening and the presidential
[46:19] changes and it gets every everybody when
[46:21] when when the when the pope passes and
[46:23] they're choosing a new pope, it gets
[46:24] everybody kind of in antsy a little bit.
[46:27] Well, maybe it should. Maybe it should.
[46:29] It's check it up time to make sure that
[46:31] as as as things begin to change and
[46:35] things begin to unfold, are we really
[46:37] where we ought to be, right? Or do we
[46:40] really have a real genuine experience
[46:43] with God or is it just based on
[46:46] experiences, just little sensations,
[46:49] just little things in life or well I I
[46:51] know God spoke to I know God healed me
[46:53] of this thing that I had. I know God
[46:55] came on the scene and he healed me and
[46:57] he helped me. He helped me with my money
[46:59] problem. He helped me with this. Well,
[47:00] that's wonderful. That's wonderful. But
[47:02] what about a real genuine experience of
[47:05] the Holy Ghost? Do you know God for
[47:08] yourself? Do you know him in the same
[47:10] way that Peter did when when you know
[47:12] Jesus come and he asked that question?
[47:13] Well, he who am I? And there was nobody
[47:16] that could answer that question except
[47:18] for one that had a revelation. Oh, when
[47:21] God comes and speaks to you himself and
[47:24] reveals to you himself, he'll take this
[47:26] word and and and begin to unfold things
[47:28] that written between the lines that the
[47:31] world has no idea, no way to understand
[47:35] because you can only understand by the
[47:37] Holy Ghost. Amen.
[47:39] How do I get in? By one spirit. We are
[47:42] all baptized into one body. You got to
[47:44] have his nature. You got to have his
[47:46] life by one spirit. We are all baptized
[47:49] into one body. Whether we be Jews or
[47:51] Gentiles, whether we be bond or free and
[47:54] have been all made to drink into one
[47:57] spirit. How do I get in? Jesus said,
[48:00] "Except you eat the flesh of the son of
[48:02] man and drink his blood, you have no
[48:05] life in you." You got to eat his flesh.
[48:08] You got to eat his word. You got to
[48:10] drink his blood. It takes the spirit,
[48:13] the life, the life to make the word
[48:16] live. Amen. God bless you, saints. Let's
[48:19] stand to our feet. I thank God we've got
[48:21] that
[48:24] promise. Whoever eats my flesh and
[48:26] drinks my blood hath eternal life and
[48:28] I'll raise him up at the last day.
[48:35] If you need prayer, come forth and we'll
[48:37] pray with you. He touched me.
[48:43] Oh, he touched me.
[48:49] and
[48:51] all the joy that floods my soul.
[48:58] [Music]
[49:02] Something
[49:04] happened and
[49:06] now I
[49:10] know he touched
[49:13] me and
[49:15] made me whole. Verse one, shackled by
[49:19] heavy burden, he touched me. Oh,
[49:23] shackled by a
[49:27] heavy
[49:28] [Music]
[49:32] burden. Need the Lord of
[49:37] g and shame.
[49:42] [Music]
[49:44] Then the hand of
[49:48] Jesus touched
[49:52] me and now I am no
[49:58] longer the
[50:01] [Music]
[50:03] same. Oh, he touched
[50:07] me.
[50:09] Oh, he touched me.
[50:15] And
[50:16] all the joy that floods my
[50:25] soul.
[50:28] Something happened.
[50:31] And
[50:32] now I
[50:35] know he touched me and
[50:41] made me whole. Since I met this blessed
[50:44] savior.
[50:47] Oh,
[50:48] since I met this
[50:51] blessed, said
[50:57] Savior. And since he cleansed and
[51:02] made me
[51:07] whole, for I shall never
[51:12] cease to praise him.
[51:18] I'll shout a while
[51:23] eternity
[51:28] rose. He touched
[51:31] me.
[51:33] Oh, he touched me.
[51:39] and
[51:40] know the joy that floods my
[51:45] [Music]
[51:49] soul.
[51:51] Something
[51:53] happened. And
[51:55] now I
[51:59] know he touched me and
[52:04] made me whole.
[52:08] Amen. Let's bow our heads and our
[52:10] hearts. Lord God, we're so grateful to
[52:12] you, Lord, for that touch, Lord. It's
[52:15] one thing when you touch us in our body
[52:17] and you make us whole in our in our
[52:19] flesh. It's one thing when you you give
[52:21] us encouraging words and help us in our
[52:23] spirit. Oh, when we when your word
[52:26] touches our soul and gives us like Peter
[52:29] said that a day star springing up, a
[52:31] light like a day star springing up
[52:33] within our heart. Now, that's an anchor,
[52:35] Lord, that that
[52:37] surpasses any kind of sensation,
[52:41] emotion,
[52:43] feeling, oneoff experiences. Yes. Oh,
[52:47] God. When you touch us, Lord Jesus. Yes.
[52:49] Lord, we're so grateful for your touch,
[52:51] for your word that you've given to us to
[52:53] strengthen us, Lord Jesus. And I pray,
[52:55] God, that your people are strengthened,
[52:57] that they're help, Lord. I pray, God,
[52:59] that you'll keep them on their way home,
[53:00] Lord, and watch them and guide them,
[53:03] Lord Jesus. Let your word just keep
[53:05] watch over their lives, Lord Jesus, and
[53:07] help them, Lord. And I pray, God, a
[53:09] special prayer of conviction over any
[53:12] hearts that are not right with you,
[53:13] Lord. I pray, God, that you'll not let
[53:16] them ever get rest until they come to
[53:18] you, Lord. Shake them in their bed at
[53:21] night, Lord. Let their tears drip like
[53:24] rain on their pillow, Lord, like David
[53:26] said. Lord Jesus, until they come to
[53:28] you, Lord God, I pray, Lord, that you'll
[53:30] draw and pull. If any lords sitting here
[53:33] or maybe on the internet realize that
[53:35] there's something lacking in their
[53:37] heart, I pray that you'll not let them
[53:39] rest until they find soloulless in your
[53:43] bosom. Grant it now, Lord, that you'll
[53:45] bless us as we go our different ways,
[53:46] Lord. Be with your people, we pray.
[53:49] Amen. God bless
[53:51] you. Sing it to him as you leave.
[53:56] [Music]
[54:00] Something has
[54:03] happened and now
