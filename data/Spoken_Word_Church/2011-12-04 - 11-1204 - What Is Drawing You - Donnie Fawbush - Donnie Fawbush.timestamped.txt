[2:43] at The Breakfast Table and the Lord just
[2:46] said okay let's go here let me show you
[2:48] this y'all ever had that happen sit
[2:50] there reading the Bible he just says I
[2:52] know you have he just said
[2:54] let's go here let's read this and let me
[2:57] tell you what what I'm what I'm trying
[2:58] to tell you here and let's just go on
[3:01] with it I'm going to first
[3:03] song of Solomon's chapter 1 verse 4.
[3:12] I've been excited about this ever since
[3:15] he's uh just brought it to me that
[3:17] morning
[3:30] y'all sort of kind of there
[3:38] Psalm Solomon 1 verse 4.
[3:43] it's gonna be a real short verse
[3:48] to my whole point this morning yeah
[3:53] everybody ready
[3:56] draw me
[3:58] now
[4:01] I'm saying Lord draw me
[4:04] okay
[4:05] that's what this is draw me we will run
[4:08] after thee the king hath brought me unto
[4:13] his Chambers we will be glad and rejoice
[4:16] indeed we will remember thy love more
[4:19] than one the upright love
[4:22] thee
[4:25] I wanted to speak on that this morning
[4:28] who's growing who's drawing me
[4:31] and uh of course if I asked anybody in
[4:35] here that y'all would say Well it better
[4:37] be word better be the Lord
[4:39] but that's what I'm going to talk about
[4:40] this morning
[4:42] I would like to say that a lot of people
[4:45] and we're talking about people in the in
[4:48] the world out there because I'm not sent
[4:51] to preach I know that
[4:53] I enjoy being here I enjoy being with my
[4:57] family fellowshipping with each and
[5:00] every one of y'all
[5:01] if I could
[5:03] I'd surround myself with you every day
[5:06] seven days a week well all of you
[5:08] good or bad
[5:10] would all work it out he'd work it out
[5:12] and uh I would do that if I could
[5:15] because I had heard a man the other day
[5:18] was talking about a gentleman at oding
[5:20] some money a little old trailer and he's
[5:23] always running him down trying to get
[5:25] his money
[5:26] and this Baptist comes in there and said
[5:28] well what can you say it's just Cannon
[5:30] father that's all it is
[5:32] so now
[5:33] the word he struck the Earth brother
[5:35] Branham the Lord
[5:38] come through that profit
[5:40] and when he struck the errors with it it
[5:42] wasn't a secret no more to those people
[5:45] that can hear and understand
[5:48] some of these take it and understand it
[5:50] by intellectual Concepts
[5:52] it's very very dangerous because taking
[5:54] the word like that will take you
[5:56] straight to death it will kill you
[5:59] or if you take it by the grace
[6:02] it's going to take you to eternal life
[6:04] and that's what I want uh I would like
[6:08] to go and use
[6:10] there's a lot of times
[6:13] during the day and and I've had these
[6:15] situations here lately for some reason
[6:17] brother Dale been preaching on perfect
[6:19] Perfection uh
[6:21] really kind of want to make me do a
[6:23] backflip when he when he read what
[6:24] brother Brown said about who's doing all
[6:26] this the Perfecter
[6:30] see and I mean all of that's there so
[6:32] but we still have something to do with
[6:34] it y'all don't think we we just got to
[6:36] step in this little red wagon he's going
[6:37] to pull us on through this thing it
[6:39] ain't gonna happen we got to get out and
[6:41] push that wagon fill it up with his
[6:44] water we got to put on a whole armor
[6:46] of God's word okay and so
[6:50] I want to go to uh Hebrews the Hebrew
[6:54] Book I don't know brother now that said
[6:56] read Hebrews what five six and seven
[7:01] five and six okay well I got into that
[7:03] last night again I tell you what I
[7:05] enjoyed it uh I'm gonna go to Hebrews
[7:07] book y'all I don't know if any of you
[7:09] got Hebrews but here but this is the
[7:12] Hebrews book y'all won't have that much
[7:14] got the book but I just want to read a
[7:16] couple of a couple of things in here
[7:18] um I'm gonna go to chapter five page
[7:21] 190.
[7:23] and what the prophet had to say about
[7:25] this
[7:30] come on
[7:32] here we go
[7:33] uh chapter 5 190 and I'm gonna read uh
[7:38] verse 41 47 through verse 150. you say
[7:42] well I saw God I saw God no you never
[7:45] saw God
[7:46] that's the way it was in the beginning
[7:48] it wasn't Adam saying no father oh
[7:50] Father I've sinned where are you it was
[7:53] father saying oh Abraham oh Adam oh Adam
[7:57] I'm sorry oh Adamo Adam where are you
[7:59] that's the nature of man that's the
[8:02] strain of man that's what he's made of
[8:06] and no man can come to me except the
[8:09] father draws him
[8:10] and all that the father gives me
[8:12] Hallelujah all that come I'll give them
[8:16] eternal life I'll raise them up at the
[8:19] last day what a blast what a blast
[8:21] promise of God Of Heaven
[8:24] where we get tonight
[8:27] uh where he swore by himself that none
[8:31] greater
[8:32] you take an oath by someone greater than
[8:34] you there's no one greater so God took
[8:38] an oath to himself
[8:40] we're getting into it now
[8:43] how he did it and when he did it
[8:46] and took an oath to himself and he
[8:50] would raise up us to make us his own
[8:53] Heritage his own children in other words
[8:57] anyway I'm gonna go to uh
[9:01] page 193
[9:03] the same book it's kind of kind of give
[9:05] you
[9:06] an idea of how strongly he felt and
[9:10] about what he's doing
[9:12] because he's coming
[9:14] he's here
[9:15] as a brother Dallas said and the prophet
[9:18] he said to come means this is present
[9:21] he's here
[9:22] uh
[9:25] Heavenly Father seeing that we are
[9:27] compassed about such a great cloud of
[9:29] witness let us lay aside every word
[9:32] everything every wrong evil word every
[9:35] bad spoken word every thought and let us
[9:39] run with patience the race that set
[9:42] before us looking to the author and the
[9:44] finisher of Faith the Lord Jesus Christ
[9:47] oh blessed
[9:49] be his most matchless and holy name now
[9:53] that he came to Earth to redeem Fallen
[9:55] man and to bring them back into the
[9:58] Fellowship of the Lord God and we thank
[10:02] could be for this and now by his grace
[10:05] it's his grace we never chose him but he
[10:09] chose us he said you have not chosen me
[10:12] and I chose you when before the
[10:15] foundation of the world
[10:17] kind of answers all of that don't it
[10:21] um I wanted to to go on to that because
[10:23] once you see where you're at as a
[10:26] Christian and in your journey I think
[10:27] all of us kind of look back and I know I
[10:29] have doubts y'all I'm sorry I do but I
[10:31] do I have one riding down the road Satan
[10:34] to jump in the truck women say hey Tom
[10:35] where you going what are you doing
[10:37] I remember what you done back there
[10:39] today
[10:40] is talking to this person they got it
[10:42] all tangled up had a little girl was
[10:44] talking to about work and brother Mark
[10:46] had talked to her about no eternal hell
[10:49] and he had spoke to her and spoke to her
[10:51] and spoke to her now this is a child
[10:52] that don't know any better really
[10:54] um she's trying to get by in the world
[10:56] just like all of us do this is a this is
[11:00] a place where you gotta fight stay alive
[11:03] um her brother sometime Baptist preacher
[11:05] her daddy was a Baptist preacher so you
[11:07] start talking to him about eternal hell
[11:09] and they had two one long and brother
[11:11] Mark said brother Diane you talk to her
[11:13] so I was talking to her and she was
[11:14] standing there puffing cigarette talking
[11:15] to me and uh I said let me ask you a
[11:19] question sister just to show you where
[11:20] sincerity really lies and I don't want
[11:22] to hurt your feelings you're talking to
[11:24] a person that was an ex-smoker
[11:26] I heard this message
[11:29] a long time and was condemned by it
[11:33] but you get to a place where
[11:35] condemnation really wears you out and it
[11:39] almost a lot of times would hinder me
[11:42] but on the other hand it made me seek
[11:45] him stronger
[11:46] to battle that because every time I
[11:49] tried to quit I couldn't right couldn't
[11:52] do it
[11:54] I'm telling you out a lot rather jumped
[11:55] off a cliff than give up a cigarette
[11:58] it was that strong on me
[12:01] and you know I grew up with that as kids
[12:04] babies imagine riding down the road with
[12:06] your babies puffing them cigarettes well
[12:08] the winners rolled up in the winter time
[12:11] guess what's going to get in their lungs
[12:13] the next thing is going to go to the
[12:15] little brain and tranquilize that little
[12:17] thing up there
[12:18] I'm not saying it's my mom and dad's
[12:20] fault I did it I remember the night he
[12:22] said put it down it don't taste good
[12:24] the last one I smoked put it down it
[12:26] don't taste good same thing
[12:29] but we go down the road with this and I
[12:31] was talking to this little girl about it
[12:32] and I said well let me ask you a
[12:34] question I saw I wasn't getting no word
[12:35] with this Everlasting she didn't
[12:37] understand what Everlasting was she said
[12:39] show me in the Bible show me the Bible I
[12:41] said well I'll find the exact scripture
[12:43] for you the LED out there Lord willing
[12:45] well she was talking to me I said now
[12:48] take your smoking for example I smoke
[12:51] and I tell you that's just a sign of
[12:54] where you're at you would not though sat
[12:57] in your daddy's Church on the front Pew
[12:59] and smoke cigarette right she said well
[13:01] right I said well then why wouldn't you
[13:07] I mean if you you don't believe no more
[13:09] than that why wouldn't you
[13:11] what's telling you so don't don't claim
[13:13] that I'm stupid here you know it's wrong
[13:17] so I'm inside you is telling me is wrong
[13:19] but you can't handle it that's the
[13:22] problem the only one that can take away
[13:24] that stuff truly takes away is the Lord
[13:26] he's got to he's the only one this is
[13:28] his body his his restoration his vehicle
[13:32] he's restoring
[13:34] and all we got to do is carry him
[13:36] something to work with his word we have
[13:39] to put that word on it's our Shield it's
[13:41] our armor it's all in all it's our only
[13:43] way out of here it's our ticket it's our
[13:45] token
[13:46] and
[13:48] well that message that came and struck
[13:50] this Earth y'all all know that this out
[13:53] there for anybody yes and a lot of them
[13:56] get it confused I've never seen anything
[13:59] as confusing in my life
[14:01] thank God did I God knew when to bring
[14:04] me into it because if I'd have got into
[14:06] some of the things I heard y'all talking
[14:07] about in in past history days I said
[14:10] them people right there they need to go
[14:12] fishing and just leave this thing alone
[14:15] to understanding comes because that
[14:17] ain't the same God I know the God I know
[14:19] is love he starts out with love
[14:21] everything he does with love and he
[14:22] makes it right
[14:28] um
[14:31] he forgets he forgets anyway uh let me
[14:36] see here
[14:38] I wanted to go to a point where this
[14:41] girl once I told her that she went in
[14:43] and later on how their little spirits
[14:46] will do to kind of reinvent themselves
[14:48] to re-establish to prop it up with the
[14:51] crutches you know the Tiny Tim thing I
[14:53] can't get by she tells brother Mark that
[14:56] I told her she was going to hell love
[15:00] you know him brought it out I said
[15:02] little sister I never told you that I
[15:06] smoke I ain't going to hell he's already
[15:08] climbed on that cross and died for me he
[15:11] died so that I might be standing here
[15:14] telling you this
[15:15] and you're standing here they don't lie
[15:18] about it come on and go read Matthew 25
[15:21] 46 it will tell you the difference if it
[15:25] don't lay it out there for you
[15:27] I mean it's just plain and simple
[15:30] the Everlasting go one place those with
[15:33] eternal life go to another place they
[15:35] are two different words
[15:37] and the mouse went
[15:39] and she left but at least you'll
[15:42] understand
[15:44] you're going to talk about God we got to
[15:47] get his word
[15:48] that's the whole thing
[15:50] never understood it took me a long time
[15:52] you hear word word at this church from
[15:54] Brother Dale and all the other people
[15:55] here words well you know what
[16:00] that's him Gotta Have It All that's
[16:02] right uh and so and moving on down the
[16:05] road when Satan jumps in my truck tells
[16:07] me I ain't got nothing I ain't got this
[16:09] and I ain't got that and I'm gonna tell
[16:10] you I don't know if he does y'all that
[16:12] way but he does me that way there's a
[16:14] lot of things that won't life there's a
[16:15] lot of pressures that that Satan he kind
[16:17] of ties you down over here and he
[16:19] tightens you down over here and he gets
[16:21] you here and he gets you there and uh
[16:23] you know I'm just sitting there going
[16:24] okay
[16:26] what do I do
[16:27] he's calling me a hot dog here
[16:31] and you know he's going to roast me
[16:34] and I'm going to know you ain't
[16:36] because there is one thing between me
[16:38] and you old son and it's his word okay
[16:40] so just happen to have a little book
[16:43] laying around the house it was
[16:45] collecting dust y'all everybody ought to
[16:48] get one of these because it's a good
[16:49] little reader I love having it it's
[16:52] questions and answers volume one
[16:55] and I want to go in here just to show
[16:57] you
[16:58] and it's really inspirational to me to
[17:00] read it because
[17:02] if you ever have any doubts you can ask
[17:04] God and go back and just pick up his
[17:06] Bible and say Lord put me where you want
[17:08] me right here
[17:10] because this listen this is all him
[17:13] front to back okay everybody agrees with
[17:16] that right yes it's him right so
[17:19] anyway you go back to his word
[17:22] and if you don't turn that flame back up
[17:24] in you just stay there a little while he
[17:26] will because once you set the atmosphere
[17:28] and you ask for his help
[17:31] he's not just going to come in there and
[17:33] push you over sister Glenn and say
[17:34] listen I want to tell you something
[17:36] you got to ask him we know that I'm
[17:40] gonna go to a questions and answer uh
[17:42] this is volume one page 157.
[17:46] uh he said right here now we take the
[17:50] wrong in the word of conversation today
[17:53] we say that a man that's converted is a
[17:56] man that's stopped drinking and
[17:59] everything and goes to church or joins
[18:01] the church he might join the church but
[18:04] that's no sign he's converted oh no bad
[18:07] I don't that just means you believe in
[18:09] unto
[18:11] he isn't converted until his old life is
[18:14] dead and he is buried in Christ and
[18:17] risen
[18:19] with him in the resurrection of newness
[18:21] of life when the Holy Spirit has created
[18:24] now the Holy Spirit
[18:27] here's the dog
[18:28] in him a Living Hope of eternal life
[18:32] which comes through the Holy Ghost see
[18:36] to me that just lights me up
[18:40] because you get down to the little tiny
[18:42] morsel of our vocabulary of
[18:45] understanding that little four-letter
[18:48] word
[18:50] Nations have been saved because of that
[18:53] little word hope
[18:55] it's the Hope from the right one
[18:58] the hope of eternal life
[19:00] all of you I for me that's it's what I
[19:04] hang on to and I want that little friend
[19:06] to be a big rope and have a bucket in
[19:08] the bottom of where I can stand in it as
[19:10] he's growing
[19:13] I want to go to uh
[19:16] First Corinthians y'all can turn that if
[19:19] you want to if you don't it's okay uh
[19:23] because I got to reading in the Bible
[19:24] last night and I just got the
[19:27] I don't know sometimes I just kind of
[19:29] get to go a little bit everywhere I get
[19:31] a little scattered uh uh about God's
[19:34] word and I just I tell you what it's
[19:37] such a wonderful thing that we have
[19:40] what's really wonderful is that God sent
[19:42] a prophet to tell Don faulbush
[19:46] you wasn't wrong
[19:48] This Thing Called Life
[19:50] and that one that you know is believe as
[19:53] the Jews do is one God
[19:56] it is the completion of the circle of
[19:58] life
[19:59] and him coming and bringing this word
[20:02] right down to the perfect end
[20:05] that there'll be a human being standing
[20:07] on this Earth one day
[20:09] so fail with the Holy Ghost
[20:12] that God will come down and say I'm
[20:13] going to draw him right up and put the
[20:15] anointing and the dead in Christ arise
[20:18] then we'll start talking to people
[20:21] that's the main is that's what this
[20:25] whole thing is about
[20:28] is getting to that place
[20:30] I'm gonna go to First Corinthians 12
[20:34] . y'all all should know it
[20:36] 13 and 14.
[20:38] he said for by one Spirit now remember
[20:41] he said he had seen his holy spirit
[20:45] for the hope
[20:48] of eternal life
[20:49] okay so now four by one Spirit we're all
[20:54] baptized into one body whether we be
[20:56] Jews or Gentiles whether we
[21:00] whether we be Bond or free and have all
[21:03] made to drink into one spirit for the
[21:07] body is not one
[21:09] member but many
[21:11] that kind of takes out respecter of
[21:13] persons down the creek don't it
[21:17] you're just as important this Papa Dale
[21:20] in this message
[21:22] I don't understand that
[21:27] when when when you when you're when
[21:29] you're talking to the Lord and and
[21:31] you're wanting to to get his help and
[21:33] things sometimes you know I'll be
[21:35] talking to him and I know all of us have
[21:38] the same dispensions you have to have
[21:40] because he's the person he's an
[21:43] individual he's got one way works
[21:46] and when you're calling on him and that
[21:48] that Spirit comes that anointing comes
[21:50] to you it's like he reaches inside your
[21:53] heart and he starts pulling these words
[21:54] and they start coming out of your mouth
[21:55] and you just start talking
[21:57] and a hundred thousand times I wish that
[21:59] I had a tight recorder where I could get
[22:01] this but it's not for that it's for me
[22:05] to strengthen me see
[22:09] it's a personal thing that's what's
[22:11] personal thank you I just got that
[22:15] and so you know if you're ever getting
[22:17] downtrodden and feel like you know
[22:19] though Devil's gonna beat you up and win
[22:21] all that and unless we're human we make
[22:23] mistakes I do
[22:25] uh there's times that I first come in
[22:28] this message I'm talking to people and I
[22:30] just got flocked by these Baptist
[22:32] preachers and they could literally eat
[22:35] me alive with scripture but when he come
[22:37] on the scene I'd stand there A lot of
[22:39] times I'd listen to them listen to them
[22:40] listen to them listen to them and they'd
[22:42] be rambling on with all these quotes and
[22:44] stuff and I'd start a word and then
[22:46] finish it I'd start something over here
[22:48] they'd finish it the scripture you know
[22:51] but when the Lord come on the scene no
[22:55] did that to him and I said two or three
[22:58] things to them and they back up like
[23:00] this and stand there and look at me
[23:03] some of them one of them really it
[23:05] brought something very special to me so
[23:07] my wife has cancer would you please pray
[23:09] for her right here he brought her that
[23:12] shot
[23:12] that's Lord he's drawing me that's right
[23:15] he's drawing all of us
[23:19] he's got the same pressure on you and
[23:21] you and you and you and all of us
[23:22] because we're all his children he's
[23:26] collecting
[23:27] okay
[23:29] it's not collecting antiques that's
[23:31] right we're gonna be better than we ever
[23:34] was
[23:35] foreign
[23:37] I kind of got off my word here a little
[23:39] bit but I wanted to to go on in some
[23:41] things that that we can see God in his
[23:44] word and to see him in his word so we'll
[23:47] recognize and understand who he is and
[23:50] uh not get fooled by that old silver
[23:52] tongue impersonator
[23:54] we have to back everything up by his
[23:56] word and uh
[23:59] so
[24:01] the only way we'll ever know him is
[24:03] through his word and seeing his word
[24:06] come from Sister June Sister Lisa sister
[24:10] tree my wife
[24:12] oh yes I said my wife
[24:15] she's my conscience most of the time if
[24:18] I could not lied on something trust me
[24:20] she don't have no problem telling me
[24:22] about it
[24:25] and that's a good thing because you know
[24:28] you have a atmosphere last night I want
[24:31] to say this because we're getting kind
[24:32] of close and uh and I probably I wanted
[24:35] to read some of the Ephesians but I want
[24:37] to get to my point
[24:38] um I'm gonna go ahead and turn over to
[24:40] Ephesians 5 right quick
[24:43] um
[24:51] why do I do this oh here we go
[24:54] I I could not uh I'm gonna go to uh
[24:58] Ephesians 4 29
[25:01] through five
[25:04] two y'all ready
[25:06] uh 429 let no corrupt communication
[25:10] proceed out of your mouth but that which
[25:12] is good to use of edifying that it may
[25:17] Minister grace to the years now for me
[25:21] this makes a big thing because uh like I
[25:23] said I'm not called a preach so I know
[25:25] that my place and my Pulpit is out in
[25:28] the world dealing with people he said go
[25:30] out there call them turn the Rocks over
[25:33] see what's under them I ain't afraid of
[25:35] no serpents
[25:37] tell me I'm not
[25:39] there's nothing there except the boo
[25:45] and grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby
[25:48] we are sealed unto the day of redemption
[25:50] let all bitterness and wrath and anger
[25:53] and clamor and evil speaking be put away
[25:56] from you with all malice
[25:59] and be ye kind I love this
[26:02] be kind to one another tenderhearted
[26:07] forgiving one another even as God
[26:09] forgave Christ's sake hath forgiven us
[26:14] be therefore followers of God as dear
[26:17] children and walk into love as Christ
[26:20] also have loved us and have given
[26:23] himself for us an offering and a
[26:26] sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling
[26:29] savior
[26:31] folks if you don't feel special reading
[26:33] that I don't know what to tell you
[26:36] I really don't
[26:39] take that
[26:40] take this take the part take take one
[26:43] part of it and hold on to it
[26:46] mine is by Stripes I'm Healed I want the
[26:49] whole thing healed
[26:51] I want to be walking again in that 20
[26:53] year old body I remembered I could just
[26:55] knock out five miles real quick
[26:58] didn't worry about no cars I could get
[27:01] there just about as fast without a car
[27:02] no insurance no gas I enjoyed it uh and
[27:08] I wanted to stand up to one more thing
[27:09] here in order to talk to you and then
[27:11] we're going to go uh
[27:14] I want to ask y'all a question
[27:17] you don't hear a lot about it but we
[27:18] hear it when the only one we preach
[27:20] ourselves but do you realize that all of
[27:22] us here
[27:24] where have got to be the manifestation
[27:27] of those those combat beasts
[27:29] understand
[27:30] we got to be the lion of the private
[27:32] Judah that says there is one God
[27:35] one true and living God his name is
[27:37] Jesus Christ
[27:39] and then we got to be like that Ox that
[27:41] says yes
[27:43] I'm a sinner
[27:45] saved by the blood of grace through
[27:47] faith
[27:49] and then we got to have that
[27:52] of the man
[27:55] that says be as wise
[27:58] as a serpent and as harmless as a dove
[28:00] when we deal with other people
[28:03] but yet we have to have a knowledge of
[28:05] our environment before we live
[28:07] and what day we're in the prophet has
[28:10] already said it uh brother Mark and I
[28:12] was talking and I want to Lord willing
[28:14] if he don't do it I am but he had nine
[28:17] things
[28:18] that he said what happened I want to try
[28:21] to touch into those sometimes
[28:24] because I've got a little pamphlet up
[28:26] there's an old pamphlet that I got from
[28:27] daddy's stuff that shows the prophecies
[28:30] from 1933 and they're always good to go
[28:33] back and read them because you can see
[28:35] listen what's going to happen
[28:38] all right we're close folks that's right
[28:41] very close
[28:42] you know why I know we're close
[28:44] because I'm getting close I feel close
[28:47] to God
[28:48] I want to get closer right I ain't near
[28:51] as close as I should be okay
[28:56] just like that lady said
[28:59] I ain't where I used to be right and I
[29:02] ain't where I want to be but I'm glad
[29:04] I'm where I'm at that's right
[29:06] but then
[29:07] when we speak to others about him we
[29:10] must remember that if we're talking to
[29:12] people outside
[29:13] it's good to talk to them
[29:15] brother Brown was very specific about
[29:17] certain things that he talked about
[29:19] walking into that that bar that morning
[29:23] well that scene that was going on there
[29:25] and it just said he was saying the Lord
[29:27] last this wipe them all out of course
[29:29] y'all know the story a little spear
[29:31] coming in front of him started throwing
[29:34] that blood around and covering
[29:35] everything that he done and he wound up
[29:37] praying for that little lady that sister
[29:40] right there in that flow got down on his
[29:43] knees and had a prayer session he said
[29:45] and that's what we got to be that's what
[29:47] a combat base would be
[29:50] and also number four
[29:53] it's part I love
[29:55] is a
[29:57] the prophecy fulfilling the prophecy
[30:00] that we all got to walk into
[30:02] we cannot just reach out there and say
[30:04] we're in the message it's too far gone
[30:07] for this church
[30:09] too many things have been preached and
[30:11] said reality
[30:14] is knowing who you are
[30:16] that you have
[30:19] you know what perfect is
[30:22] you know what it is to go through that
[30:24] process of perfection
[30:26] and now we know
[30:29] who draws us
[30:36] and for me
[30:38] I say Amen
[30:40] because they don't get any better than
[30:42] that let's just keep walking in the word
[30:46] y'all already go up and have dinner
[30:50] I hope you all enjoyed it thank you I
[30:53] enjoyed doing it thank you Lord
[30:56] amen amen
