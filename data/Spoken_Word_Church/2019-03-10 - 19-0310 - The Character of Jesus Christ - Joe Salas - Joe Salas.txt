TRANSCRIPT
========================================
good morning brother sectors today I don't want to talk on character character means as distinctive quality one of the attributes or features they make up and distinguish the individual brother came up here he did a good job I mean he didn't sugarcoat the word he told you what he felt so that's kind of like I want to do so you're firing me see well won't need it what it what he said but you know keep talking I brought the spirit and the message the the Shepherd of the sheep oh brother Barrett said there's three things and Minister has to watch for this women popularity and money so Sampson fell because of Delilah Saul fell because of his pride and Balaam fella because money and then all those things are written for our sample and the message got in and revealing simplicity for the room said a man was made to rely completely upon God that's the reason that's the reason we would like unto him at the Lambs of sheep as she cannot lead himself he has to leader and the Holy Spirit is supposed to be so man is made that way and God made all of it works so simple that the simple to understand it and God makes himself simple the simple in order to be understood by the simple simple simple [Music] so God in the beginning that could have made the son preach the gospel or wind preach the gospel an angel preach the gospel but he owed a man for that purpose and he never changes it he never again individuals he never ordained denominators he never ordained groups of men he ordained meant to preach the gospel not machinery mechanical devices or any I'm jellybeans he was man said God can give a man a start to do something and give him a ministry the first thing you know we'll go to Karen what others say and the first thing you know you'll be all wrapped up and a bunch of stuff and then God just takes his hat off and let him alone and the absolute program said God doesn't deal with groups of man God deals with individuals because man has different ideas he was built up and different in nature and God has to take that man and mess him Iran and for him Iran out of his own self - he gets nature and damn God deals with that person let's go to Galatians 6 okay the Latian six that just read two to five alleged six chapter six verse 2 there you one another's burdens and so fulfill the law across for the man thinking himself to be something when he is nothing he deceived himself but then let every man prove his veto let every man prove his own work and then shall he have rejoicing himself among and not in another man for every man shall bear his own burden I'm I'm not that God makes me something just like Moses most of them do all that miracles God did God and Moses so but the burning truck talks about people that just love themselves you know about neighbors ourself but they don't mean it that way me me me me so this time I get in trouble I say I have a I have a broken spirit we have some friends that go to a different church and they got two daughters they went to another Church and they left the church and went to a denomination because the preacher every Sunday would just preach I know everything you gotta do anything if you don't listen to me you gonna help so there and say you preach it on staying with the word you can leave and right I know I know we are sheep we have to be led by the great Shepherd and that fivefold ministry is like the little dog but sometimes he thinks God is not watching and he trusts to the scatter of the Sheep you know that little dogs supposed to have that help the shepherd hit that sheep into the bowl brother Brad said you cannot preach them as you've been with God in the back of the desert I'm not getting trouble here to some preacher need to go up to the back of that desert we are the body of Christ when one of us gets hurt will that's my main thing they wanna say well Martha thought he could do it on his own but God said I can't use you now so he sent him to the desert for 40 years with his father-in-law Jethro which she was a he was a shepherd but I think most of what happened to could support let's go to Exodus for 25 to 26 for 25 to 26 and it came to pass by the way in in the end that the Lord met him and sought to kill him then support took a sharp stone and cut off the foreskin of it our son and tested at his feet and said surely a blooded husband are thou to me so I guess his wife kept them and kept them in line you said if you don't do this I'm gonna give you cry the message lead from the heart mother grandma said a man is known but his character is nobody's but his character is known by his works no matter who he is the works proof this character if you take the man no matter how good he tries to be if it's works are evil and all his goodness more amount to nothing a man's work is his character ecstasy a man that his word is no good then you'll never have a confidence in that man because it works no yes so therefore God our Father his character and his works prove what he is a man works the purse is curved for price was God's work in Christ the pure gossip character his feeling for the sake is longing for the same in his soul till even he gave his own life God the character was it was declared in Christ brother way it is in the Philippines so we need to pray for him but brother weight is one of the best preachers we got in the message so we won't send him to the back of the desert and we will send him to the Philippines but the burner said that the worst centre is the one that thinks he knows it all self-centered he said they don't need correction they know everything he said they they know it all he said you said their head is bigger than their stomach that's what he said but the devil doesn't need our help he's doing a good job brother and says we're helping and we're just fighting and shooting each other and Hebrews chapter 7 for to adversity it's a few people they saw blade temper there's always spotted off at the mouth at somebody can't put up and things like that be careful you killed me if you speak a word against your brother that's not right no just right go around there tear down tear down it you don't have to stick the knife in the mess back to kill him you say you can break this character and kill him kill his influence to peace speak against your pastor here say something bad about him you just might as well as shut him told us something it wasn't right about him well it'll kill his inference with the people and things like that and your guilty of it what Jesus said that brother Dale says I'll never say that big deal if you don't listen to me you're going not everybody and the message is LinkedIn there's so many in every basket there's a lot I say wait he one that's Bridget we got the message here you him back in the Old Testament on my father owned a big Kingdom and a child was born unto the king now he was a son as soon as he was born but yet that son didn't he would be here of all the father had his character was right but first his character had to be proved now you Minister know what I'm going to it's the placing of a son now this character didn't show up right he didn't inherit anything he was just a son so then the father in order to get this great stunt of his who he loved he had business to be doing so he got the tutor trainer or his children a stop to the places until he found the best man he could find because his son's education and the future of his son depended on what kind of training that shall God and that's the way it is today in the kingdom of God that we were born the kingdom of God God sought the best tool that he could find for the church and there was a holy spirit life is what controls us we are known by the life that we live and has been said that your life speak so loud that I can't hear you you're testing on testamental so therefore to live a sermon would be much better than to preach one life you live shows what character you are because your life always builds your character and Jesus said by the truth you shall know them so no matter what we would say or how much we always tested by if our life doesn't concern concededly that testimony we're doing the kingdom of God and then dead men by giving that testimony because people know what we are and I often thought that a funeral service to hear men preached the funeral of a some person that had live ungodly and had never done anything right and yet preachers though they were a great person they had done that gone right into heaven and the end time Angela's brother and said Jesus comes characters not members you know that becomes character God always tries to get one man and he's had that that's all you need is one man and he will do his work through the you know just think you can only find one righteous man in the time I know in the time my motives he only found one righteous man he said God looking for character not membership character early years old when he went to get the product for Isaac he sweated it out until he found character Abraham put him responsible as God puts us responsible right we ministers taught my bride god bless your heart I'm looking for members I'm looking for the pure in heart see somebody they'll believe in the world no question no comment identification now but we find that there as we've gone through life that our character multi-image that we are each one knows that as you live your character wants you to what you are now you have seen people that you just love to be around yet they might not be accepting your bracket of society and again there might be a different race color or the brown of the yellow but there there's just something about that character you just have to be in their presence because it's person is the diamond on the line that their own and you put out an atmosphere let's go to Roman's 14 there's 240 11 to 13 we're almost 40 level 13 positive rhythm as I live saith the LORD every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to God so then every one of us shall give account of himself to God that is there now therefore just just one another anymore by judgment rather that no man put a stumbling-block or an occasion to Paul and his brothers way let's go to Hebrews six here for six first one that's it they're for the living therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ less let us go on to perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works in a faith toward God I heard a news and confirmed that they had had some robust stocking up shelves you know and one of them had a short and he caught a bit he caught out of it I mean he started a bit farther so when the firemen came in then a lot of time because the robots kept working and the CEO so no matter what what the devil throws at us we got to stand our ground a brother gonna say we've got to stand their ground like the robots did so it often let go if only one out of George's it's going that you say you you not save me so let's be like the world no matter what that okay let's go to Luke chapter sit and this was not the I need all the help of a responsive reading sixth look six we're going to start with 20 all the way to 46 and why have the attitude 6:28 and he lifted up his eyes on his disciple and said let's be poor for yours is the kingdom of God let us are you when men shall hate you and wish they shall separate you from their company and you shall we shall reproach you and cast out your name as evil for the son of man's sake you have received your constant constellation all unto you and all men shall speak well of you for so did your fathers to the false prophets but them that curse you and pray for them which despitefully the spicy after every man that asks of me and of him and take it away thank good dying good ask them not again my eyes for if you know that we love you what thank have ye for sinners sinners also love those who love them and if you lend to them of whom you hope to receive what they gave you for sinners also lend to sinners to receive as much again therefore merciful as your father also is merciful for heaven given it shall be given unto you good measure pressure down and shaken together and running over shall men give unto you men give unto your bosom for with the same measure that we eat meat we all it shall be measured to you again and then why made that one the disciple is not above his master but everyone there is per feet shall be as his master you hope tennis thou say to thy brother brother they pull up in remote that is then the high when not thyself of the oldest not that beam that is in thine own eye hypocrite test up that first beam out of thine own eye and then shalt thou see clearly to pull up them Moulton is in thy brother's eye boy [Music] precisely and the message why Christ speak brother said God goes to church every day just yes just lives in church even if the church he lives and just you you're his church you're his truth you are the tabernacle that God dwells in your the Church of the Living God yourself and then living God lives in his living being then your actions is of God if it isn't that God isn't there he won't make you act like that when he says and his work here his blueprint don't don't do it and you go do it see that's wrong when you deny it it showed that the life isn't even in you the water of separation program said products had to die to make us all alive freaking us is that right so it's only through no matter what church do you belong to how many times you shook hand with a preacher how many how many names you got in the book or how many churches you belong to it doesn't mean that you've got to absolutely accept the death of the Lord Jesus Christ and not only that but you got to die to yourself you got to die to every thought of the fish that you can receive their mind of Christ and walk from henceforth not of your own but of his mind the mind of Christ in you that's the only way you can stay alive that's the only way I can stay alive that's all a little part is by the Holy Spirit and the influence brother I'm said remember the Bible said you're living written officials made of old man now many people won't read the Bible but God has made you live in the representative you're a walking letter should you be a walking Bible of Christ in you you should be the walking one of God and if you profess to be a Christian and not that you're influenced what your infant sent will make you have to answer for many stones that you turn aside away from the crowd from Christ in that Judgment Day whatever whatever happens in your life you can change her you can change your attitude what Joseph's brothers did dip to him there were that was pretty bad so but Joseph chose the right attitude they say God did this to preserve life so when his brothers finally recognized what he said we're toast Joseph Joseph changes attitude there's three steps to join first one is Jesus others and you last so he must increase we must decrease but everybody says they put upside down big brother jeepers we have a guy at my work oh yeah I'm a team player yeah right [Laughter] [Music] they don't want us to find our place no more they don't once they made I guess crazy you're talking about our character and that's what you started out with and power character is molded and I may be silly but I think of a jello mold everybody seen your jello mold yeah what if you put in Cool Whip jello and nuts and maybe help me fruit there we go and you leave it on the counter yeah what happened okay nothing but you have to put it in the right atmosphere right to change what all right inside there now you can take those thing and then you have a different outcome depending on if you put it in the freezer or the refrigerator or anything yeah so it's it's where you are did your attitude where you go but you can take the same mold and put pure water in it and put it in the same you have you have your choice again we have the water of the word you have your choice again you can leave it in the Sun you can leave it on the counter or you can put it in the refrigerator the freezer and it changes one of these but it's still a cycle anymore it's still the same ingredients but it changes the character right of what you take out of that mold you can dump it out liquid or you can leave it in there and turn it into something else it was alright the atmosphere there so it's kind of silly yeah I was in the kitchen too long I guess but oh yeah [Music]
