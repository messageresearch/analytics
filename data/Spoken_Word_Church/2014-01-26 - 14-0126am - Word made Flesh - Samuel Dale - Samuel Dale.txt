announcements but the heavenly father we thank you Lord for this day in the time that we have we thank you for grace and Calvary thank you for the love that you've given unto us and extended into our hearts and our lives that we may Lord have an opportunity to be able to serve you we love you and we thank you Father for All Things We Praise Your Great Name bless those that are not here today remember Wade there at Blue Ridge at the church and remember to the dean there preaching for his brother remember all of these remember the ones that are sick among us because we know that there's a lot of them a lot of people that are sick and all of the doing their wife's still having problems and it's just the Old Devil with all of his things that's doing Lord and he's trying to hinder in every way and remember Bob's kids and and all of them being sick our Lord and just touch each one we ask you to remember the one brother Richard was talking about this morning that had a kidney stone we pray that you would just let that pass away and be completely made whole we love you and we thank you father in Jesus name amen John 1. checking to make sure I got all of my announcements John 1 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him without anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness in the darkness comprehended it not there was a man sent from God whose name was John the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe now my point I want you to see is and we won't we'll get into some of it but see right in the middle from where it's beginning the word and then the word becomes flesh you've got to have John the Baptist to come to introduce Jesus Christ all right so then in the end time when you would come down through see then you would have to have uh as we get over into the first John you've got to have another Messenger to come in the end time to to to be the point right all right so to show you what we're trying to fit together verse six there was a man sent from God who's whose name was John the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the light that all men through him might be believed he was not that light that was sent to Bear witness of that light that was the True Light which lighteth every man man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came into his own in his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power or authority you know the right to to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of God now see you're coming right into the bride part right okay now and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we believe beheld his glory as the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth now I like little John because the same authors writing this writes in the little Johns after he's coming over you know and bringing his message as he comes back from Patmos John 1 1. first John 1 1 that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon in our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we've seen it in by our witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifest unto us actually not just manifest or may know but come alive in them because this is John riding after the Holy Ghost right that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that you also may have fellowship with us until our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ and these things right we unto you that your joy may be full this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk into light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin amen you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word and as I said I hope you take the point because you know reading the two different scriptures is covering the same thing is covering in the beginning was the word word was with God the Word was God and then covering him coming down to you and I and in the middle of it there's got to be a witness to come forth see to bring the message that you and I could comprehend it and then coming out to be in you and I in the end of it now also I'm going to try for a little while now and see how it works um I'm going to be reading a lot but I will not be putting it on the screen for you to read and a lot of it I maybe just be quoting it as we go through because I want to try that to see how it works uh sometimes reading I realized that the human mind looks and sees words and words appear and and sometimes your thought will be distracted from what I'm saying unto you because you'll be reading on down below or above and you're into a totally entirely different thought so I'm going to try that and see how it works and all when and uh so you just pray for me glad to have sister milkers brother they're with us good to see him now we've covered in the message on predestination a lot of the things and I did not bring it to a total conclusion of doing but I'm hoping this will make us to understand my point you know of of preaching the way that I have and coming down to seeing the end of all things now I was kind of thinking the other day about something and it was kind of funny the way it came out and my thoughts but you'd have to be in mind or you probably would think it's funny but you know the Bible is we talk about it being the word of God we talk about it being you know God revealed to us all right now that's exactly true because we believe it all right now but it's also revealing people you know down through the Bible is revealing now listen to what I'm talking about see then I thought well you know we have to give all the honor and glory to him because it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves you know whatever we are he has made us that all right if we're part of the word then he made us part of the word all right that's that should be sensible but I'm thinking about it and I thought well what percentage would be the Bible in relation to God in relation to his people or mankind and I thought well surely we don't want to give ourselves too much credit because uh you know that would would run out into the wrong area and uh you know that's what I see in some people the way they do they have totally forgotten God in the word and they just went into themselves you know and building themselves up all right and and that's to me that's not the point that I've always tried to do so I come up with this thought that the Bible then consists of in a I'll express it to her and the people will understand it uh to me the Bible is the revelation of almighty God all right one true and living God all right it's the revelation of that all right be in the revelation of one true and living God then you know it all the way through the words you're talking about God being made manifest no matter what age time or whatever throughout the Old Testament as well as the new you're talking about the manifestation of God or God made manifest that's the reason I read that in in John where it's in the beginning was the word and words with God and coming down the internet and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us well see I believe that in the end time the word has to be made flesh again in The Bride of Jesus Christ all right now in believing that because I believe that's the way the prophet taught it see then I came up with a conclusion that the Bible is now you life at my doings but remember wait till I get through all right uh the Bible is 75 revealing God now you said when I saw one hold on to your point and get my get my thought and then all right we'll come back to it all be in God don't worry about it because that's what you know I'm doing but it's 75 percent of revealing God and 25 of revealing mankind are people the children of God all right now as we'll read in a little while the prophet says that that God is not complete without you and I all right because that's the way he chose to do it it's not something that we are it's what he chose to do so the entire Bible is the revelation of Jesus Christ right but to do that then there's going to have to be somebody on the earth that will make manifest that part of God that they are and that's what your prophet's done see for the day and the hour they were leaving they were the word made manifest for the time but only in a portion for their time none of them were the fullness but it says in Colossians 2 there that they're talking about Jesus Christ that he's the fullness of the god hit bodily all right when he stepped up on Earth he was God made manifest in his fullness River Jordan coming down Etc going all the way through it turns out to be almighty God all right and we believe that all right but see then if it was just the writing of or how can I say it if the Bible you say it's a revelation of Jesus Christ and I agree with you 100 now to listen but you know there's got to be somebody make manifest the parts where he could be the fullness so the Old Testament gave birth through those prophets right the word they brought gave birth to Jesus Christ but now each one of them had their part to where he could be the fullness because in him all things according to the Bible all right now so then the New Testament would be the same way as the old in the Old Testament they gave birth to Christ the lies to the Old Testament was who John the Baptist he the third coming of Elijah to introduce the Messiah all right now so then the end time if it would end up in the same way and I believe it does according to John 1 and first John 1 showing identically the same that the fullness of the word is going to be brought forth in the end time all right now in doing that then it had to be an Elijah come right because of Malachi 3 was John the Baptist right see he was the one of Isaiah 42 or what I believe it is in there where you know what's in my messenger he was the fulfilling of that well who's the fulfilling of Malachi 4. well there's a group down in Florida claims they are there's a group of but worries any of them now I'm just asking a simple question because I'm just simple everybody says you're so deep now I'm so simple until it's I'm an idiot I have a nice great education so you know that all right but there's got to be an individual bring it not a group of people because the the coming of Elijah was what you got Elijah right you've got five times in the Bible of the coming of Elijah all right you got Elijah Elisha had a double portion of the spirit of Elijah right Elijah done four Miracles check your Bible Elisha done eight Miracles all right see showing the double portion then you've got John the Baptist the spirit and the power of Elias that Jesus said all right see identifying him all right then who's Malachi 4. see we know that through the two witnesses to Israel to wind it all up that that will be Moses and Elijah all right there's arguing over whether Moses or whatever they want to make it Enoch or whatever but everybody even the scholars teach that it will be Elijah it will come to the Jews not the person of Elijah because John the Baptist was not the person of Elijah that's why when they asked him they asked him was he Elijah you remember he says no see because if he said he was all of it first off he would have been lying for the fact that he would have been saying I'm Elijah well that's reincarnation we don't believe in it but second off he would have been the fulfilling of all of the things of Elijah so it couldn't be all right so then looking at it see then there's got to be that fourth one to come forth to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers according to Malachi 4. all right Jesus referred to here it's refers there in Matthew I believe it is about John being you know the Elijah that was to introduce the Messiah all right then there's got to be one in the end time to introduce the end time of all things right that's what's going to bring to pass the end of all thing is the the word of God to be revealed to the people all right just getting the point now because I'm talking about the Bible being 75 God 25 man all right see because I'm not going to make the Bible 50 man and 50 God that would not even fit where it would come into him being the fullness but if you're looking at it and seeing that somebody's got to make him manifest all right then he does use mankind amen he uses mankind to manifest himself so then the Bible is fully 100 God but mankind is used to bring the word for that age Moses was the word of the hour that he was living right Jeremiah Ezekiel Malachi all of those they were the word of their hour that's why that the enemy could not stop them you agree there was no way that they could stop them or they may wind up killing them but even the greatest of all you know of the killing of anybody who maybe you think about was Samson and those were just judges that were to come forth you know to judge of children of Israel and even in him in his death he killed more than he killed in all of his life so it's not belittling of anything but it's God made manifest all right now that's the point of what I'm talking about word made flesh because that's what it says in John 1 14 and the Word was made flesh all right we know that's talking of Jesus Christ let's see the people then was to make manifest what they were so you can see Christ in Moses right you can see Moses Evan nearly even trying to show God a better way of doing something God he said if you killed him you got to kill me first you remember that the prophet of God said even himself he said I wondered about that until one day I seen it was Christ in Moses so what were all of those prophets Christ anointed ones all right now what is the bride of Christ that's right come on he's not she to be the Messiahs the little Messiahs are we not God made manifest in human flesh again we'll get back to it at the end of the message in the bride of Christ all right now but to do that then what I want us to do is look at it so does everybody understand now the reason I said 75 25. I don't want you to misunderstand that and say who thinks there's 25 of it to us no it's God in us it's been God in man it's never been man it's been God in man all right the brother Randall said it on Christ The Mystery of God's reveal paragraph 233 look Christ in you makes him the center of the life of the revelation Christ in you makes him the sinner of the life of the Revelation all right Christ life in you makes him the center of the revelation all right did you get it Christ in you makes him the center of the Revelation Christ's life in you makes him the center of the Revelation Christ the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ Christ in you makes the complete revelation of the whole thing you see what God is trying to do then he goes on to talk about what what is the new birth brother random it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you or in you all right now then taking that we're talking about the word the word is being going to be made flesh all right my point is listen there has to be a word then for each age all right there's always been a word for each age but there's always been to someone to make manifest that word for each age all right going back to our predestination what we believe in predestination we believe the Bible Romans 8 surely you ought to remember that by now those who before knew he did predestinate it doesn't say those he predestinated he might have known them it doesn't say that it says those who he foreknew all right how does God predestinate by for knowledge for knowledge is first then predestination our destiny is to be determined after he had the foreknowledge so if we were in his thinking right and if we're not in his thinking we sure missed it all because according to this book of Revelations the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and our names were written in that book if not never will be written there well my name was written there when I joined the church well that's a good Baptist Doctrine it's not the Bible all right see then just getting to the points driving down some little thoughts that we brought along the way but not to try to stay on it that much all right see then God for ordains things to take place how he predestinates it to take place right how by his foreknowledge he doesn't desire that anybody be lost he desires that everybody be saved and see to you here then you you understand a lot but just remember um brother Joe and these are on the internet the quotes that I'm using so then if I you should know where they're at but others out there it is on the internet to where that they can read it and see what it is okay all right so we're not leaving a loophole for somebody else trying to get down to a place to talk to you and I because I am one to believe in one thing I believe we're in the end time but if we go 15 more years what's the matter 20 more years 30 more years 50 more years we're going to be old and like I told them in the fellowship meeting I said if we don't get out of here we're going to have Fellowship meetings in the nursing home because we're going to be there and some of you that are young are going to be there and maybe before we get there uh-huh Terence Sims already picked out ours we don't they won't tell us where it's at that's the secret you know maybe you're wearing a chicken house you know with a cow today all right but there's a word for every age all right now you remember the story The Prophet told he said that it wouldn't have been no good for Moses to come along and said okay now what we're going to do he said we're going to leave Egypt you know the words right there on the Nile you know right there I said what we'll do is we'll just build an ark and we'll float out of here been pretty good art for about two and a half million people in all their cattle and all the things but God could still do it I don't worry about that if they'd have been all those people would have been saved in the days of Noah you know Noah would have been 240 years instead of 120 because he would have built an ark big enough to take all the people if if it was God's plan but we know that it didn't work out that way all right but see Moses couldn't say I'll do like Noah why because Moses had the word of the hour for the time that he was living all right in comparison to the Noah having the word for the hour that he was living all right but see as you come down then you come from there to Abraham and and to David and and and Solomon and and and on down you know Joshua and all the different ones each one of those people and the people of the hour that they were living right there was only seven more in the days of Noah that received the message of Noah now the other was probably hung around they probably sympathize with it or said as the prophet said they probably went up there and hung around the door and said come on out Noah but said just in case I'll hang around the ark a while they probably had good camp meetings and sit around there waiting but when the rain started they got the beaten on the ark but there was no way to get in all right but that's no matter what it is if it's only seven remember Enoch was the only one that represented the Rapture all right so there was only one really walked off the Earth in that day in the true word of God all right now then see there's been somebody everything you read we read in John well John witnessed this and wrote about it see that was the word of the age or the time are you following me so they never aged down through the Old Testament coming through the New Testament there has been somebody to make that word alive for the age that mankind was Dire and that word was the seed that we talked about that the prophet of God says on the the 154 Church age book that what it is not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God it is this word or seed all right see the person comes predestinated by foreknowledge because God knew who would want to be saved and who wouldn't all right so he could predestinate okay we say well I was born with this seed in me well we went through the whole series part of trying to express that that does God have to put something in you for you to be able to say you had deceived because be careful if you put eternal life in you and you still lost because Jesus Christ had to die before anybody could receive eternal life all right the Old Testament people had to go to paradise they could not go into heaven so that shows that there was no uh New Birth there was no eternal life for the person in the Old Testament because Jesus Christ was that life amen you agree see then then him throughout the fullness of the godhead bodily see then he paid the price for the old he went and even preached to those that were disobedient even into hell and preached to them but he picked up the Old Testament Saints and took them up why because they were not able to go up that should let anybody know that that the Bible says that Jesus Christ had not been crucified the Holy Ghost had not been given that scripture because he had not been crucified well brother Dale I think they had eternal life all the way down well good for you I don't I believe they had to wait on Jesus Christ if they had eternal life in the Old Testament why was they waiting on him that's right always just to get a body back he can speak all he wants to but we know he won't because we don't believe in we believe in Redemption of these bodies all right now so it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally the person comes predestinated by foreknowledge he knows what we'll do he knew what Esau would do he knew what Jacob would do so he could say Jacob have I loved Jacob shyster that was his name shyster you can always tricking everybody Esau was a good guy all he ever done tried to take care of his daddy but the Bible said Jacob have I loved Esau have I hate it why because he knew what they was going to do God doesn't predestinate my desires he desires it all be saved all right but we know everybody won't be so that it's our choice and he can look down and see what our choice is so then he could go ahead and predestinate but now watch he would predestinate where that seed would fall what does that say in a moment ago now you've got to draw out something and put a spot that's where everybody wants to do it they want these fancy drawings everybody's got drawings what I'd like for you to draw me one I'd like for you to draw me a drawing that Jesus Christ is the Lamb of God slain from the foundation of the world then draw me a drawing overlaid that all in one drawing to show me that he's the lion of the tribe of Judah and that he's the dove that comes down oh people's trying to draw that out but how can you put it in there the only way you can get the lamb and the lion together is what changed the nature of the line you certainly don't want to change the nature of the Lamb now if you understand what I'm driving at so Jesus Christ had to die to release that life that was in him to where anyone that could be would believe then could have eternal life all right so then he would look down through time and see even the little woman you know with the five husbands into things you could say there was a seed in her well does God have to put a spot for it to be some why not his foreknowledge representation what did we cover future home representation from predestination so the little woman was represented in heaven right by who by Christ and when the Lamb's Book of Life were just correctly to say the book of the Lamb that was slain before the foundation order to do that then he saw she would accept him but as I was saying then we want to make it to where it looks like she came here with something extra in her the prophet of God I didn't cover this through the series but I thought you ought to know it I spoke of it the prophet of God says everybody in the world is born with that faith you need to quote call me everybody everybody was born with a desire to serve God no matter what if that's not true why does the hot and tots for the Indians the eskimos or whatever why do they worship totem poles because they know there's a Creator because they are a creation and anybody's dumb enough to believe in evolution I want you to tell me where the pollywog comes from that's all I want to know they say well let's probably walk it done this and it doesn't have well just tell me where the pollywog come from that's all I want to know I'm not no problem no argument for anybody I just want to know where it come from if it didn't come from if it come from a germ and then a pollywalk where'd the germ come from we just keep going backwards and you can do all you want to but think about it now God predestinates by his foreknowledge and he could look down through and see everybody that would either be saved or lost now if you can't do that then what kind of a god are we talking about all right but in doing that then he would be watching that seed but does God have to put a spot somewhere does he have to put a word in you or does he know that you will receive it then all I've asked just a simple question to me simple everybody says we're born with this seed in us I believe what the prophet said I just got through expressing that the gods foreknowledge is all he needs all right but you say no no we got to have this thing in us well then if you had the thing in you why did you have to receive it and all I've ever asked is the new birth is it the birth and once you come into the world with or is it the birth of what you receive after you got here of course most people believe that you don't need to do birth you always was eternal well that ain't I don't know of a denomination that even teaches that so now you can see how far I believe it and what I'm standing on if do you know one denomination now you got your your wrong Mormons that believe in pre-existence but they still got to have an Earthly Journey they've got to have a being here what's wrong with us what's our problem but there's a word or seed predestinated for each age Noah was that Moses with that Joshua was that David Solomon Amen in all the Old Testament prophets and people but now I know I probably won't get to it this afternoon but if I do if not just remember I'll give you the quote for it you know that brother random call those Prophets he said the prophets are carrier he said the denominations are carriers brother Dale I don't like you good let you tell me those Prophets were the word no the word came to the prophet the word is Jesus Christ all right now we get down to where we solve the problem Mary was not God she was not even the seed s about all you want to she was a carrier of the seed the seed was in Mary that's what I'm concerned with I'm not concerned with Mary all right that's a long ways on down the road that's all right we've been through some of this but listen do you see what I'm talking about then what happens is on proving his word he's got to predestinate it to that age he does everything by the same method he says so he predestinates for that age in order words to have Believers to meet the word he's got to predestinate it to that age see Church listen I'm not preaching about what the method is worth the Baptist where the Presbyterian the thing like Wade was talking one day I believe you're talking about uh you know Abraham you know we're not Abraham we we read about him we're the Seed of Abraham yeah we read about him but who wants to go back to Abraham I mean you want to go home we want to go to tents and and living in the deserts oh no no no no no no no no no you're silly well not no you're silly our preaching has been done about a lot of people have done it about other people that's why I come up with a 75-25 because other people are 75-25 and I explained that didn't I that it's 100 God but mankind is used but the bride in the end time is not 75-25 she will be 100 percent or there will be no rapture you see why that I've spent 40 something years screaming and hollering at you about the word of God instead of playing around with little sugar tits and all the words you dress you hire your clothes you get borned again it'll take care of your dress and you hire in your clothes if you don't take care of it you ain't born again any problems you still have trouble whether or not to cut your hair paint your face then get born again well I believe on okay I believe will you let me get the Holy Ghost in there and you can't get a holy ghost woman to wear pants or or could her higher her painter he said that's Bible that's not brother Dale or brother Branham that's Bible go back and read what they've done and how they were and then bring it down not throwing off on nobody is trying to be right so he predestinates the seed when he predestined Malachi 4 it's got to happen when he predestinated Malachi 4 it's got to happen why because that's a predestinated seed see that's the way I believe in the seed being in you he knew that brother Branham wood want the word oh but he was born with the word in him were show me that in the message even Jesus the Bible says grew in Grace and knowledge why because he was a human element the outside was a human element inside was the god of Glory he didn't know everything wait a minute now he's gone well you argue with the Bible because Jesus said he didn't know when he's coming so you argue with the Bible you argue with the prophet don't argue with me there's no need of it I'm probably on Redemption for most people's ideas that's all right I just keep going because I didn't get here on account of you I got here on account of the word of God 40 something years I've been trying to preach the word of God to you and stand to this day to show me where I've been wrong if that's exalted Do What You Won't Do with it but I want you to show me where I've been wrong of course you talk among yourselves where I'm wrong come in my office and tell me I'll be glad to come out here and say I was wrong brother Donnie fabush showed me the truth I'll give you all the honor and Glory well I just don't well it's okay what about the word that's all I'm concerned with I ain't concerned with your feelings my feelings my family's feelings my wife my kids grandkids and great-grandkids I'm concerned with one thing trying to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ for you and I to be saved and when we get on the other side we laugh about all this other stuff and we will I don't think we're going up to heaven I think we're gonna have a good time this is just a starting ground all right come on now we know for a certainty that according to the Bible and according to the prophet bringing the message to you and I that Jesus Christ was the fullness of the godhead bodily it was all resting in the son of God not God the son now because it's different get out of it he was the full manifestation of God you believe that that's what the Bible says about it so you know what he was he was the fullness of the word right all right see the prophets only pointed to him and listen they even pointed to the fullness in themselves now that you don't have to listen a little bit right and there wasn't no other word in the days of Moses Moses had it no he's pointing to the word in himself that's why he said and went down there who's going to free he said I am he said well that's just being carnal huh you go Carnival you want to God told Moses to go down there he said I'll be with you amen amen so who was it brought him out of Egypt Moses no no no it was Christ right but Moses was still used there had to be somebody to make that word alive for that day and that was all of God for that day now if you miss it when we get on through the message in the days of Martin Luther the judge shall live by faith that struck Martin Luther was the fullness of God for that hour there was no more to be brought in that day that's how I believe it that's why you can't leave them out of it even though you can call them carriers but just remember the end time bride that will eventually be the fullness starts as a carrier because you get the same Holy Ghost that fell on the day of Azusa Street no no no no no brother I got the Holy Ghost to come to well I ask you to read about four messages or listen one of them is called a masterpiece the other one is called the identified masterpiece the other one is called season not out with a shock and check those out because see you've got them in California you got them in in Jeffersonville you've got them in different places so this and I'd ask you to read the unveiling of God I'd ask you to read the Mighty God unveiled and even look at the titles read Christ is right now the mystery of God revealed who is this Mount has a deck not who was mankind didn't even know who he was that gives you a lot to read but why not I thought we believed the word I mean you you got a little time oh you're riding down the road just put Masterpiece in and listen to it you know I mean you got a little time at home what's wrong we're sitting down and listen to tape might wind up be like my neighbor there he said he said we'd always be a bird little boy in our neighbor's boy because he ain't a boy now you know the kids and always waiting him he said we'd be up at the house playing with Wade and him and said that man being there preaching all the time he wasn't making no light of it you know he just said that man being there preaching all the time well that's pretty good testimony but if you would just listen to masterpiece listen to see not out with a shock the identified masterpiece just listen to those and you'll hear everything that I'm talking about but look the prophets being the word for the hour they were living right go see God spoke it let me put it this way Moses interpreted it well then you turn back around and see that no man can interpret so it must have been Christ in Moses because Moses couldn't understood the Ten Commandments even though he was giving them the right but it was Christ in him to interpret to mankind had they listened to what Moses was saying they were not wound up with so many Book of Rules that they had to live by because it was never meant to be a book of rude it was meant to be a revelation of Jesus Christ all right We Believe or to believe these things without any problem that he was the fullness of the word Jesus Christ was the fullness of the word that in him would dwell all the fullness of the godhead bodily so then words or any second person third person and then when he comes on over there in the scriptures after his resurrection and what does he say he said all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth well where's the power of the father where's the power of the Holy Ghost that's why we believe in one truth Living God if he was the fullness of the godhead bodily that means all of God would dwell in him all right now we won't get to it this morning but remember all that God was he poured into Christ right and all that Christ was where's he poured into the bride the church all right what you see he was then wisdom versus faith he was the predestinated word he was the predestinated word all right all of those pointed towards him he was the person of God that was to stand in that day to be the sacrifice for sin to fulfill the scripture and then he could say Philip said or which one was it one of them said show us the father he said have I been so long with you said if you've seen me you're saying the father well maybe in a what see that's where we reasoned it come up with a trinity and see it won't work or a garden tree person's Trinity all right but now if we believe that he was the person of God you remember the statement he's not the first he's not just third person second person he's not even the first person he is the person because if he's the first person that could be two or three more or a hundred more but if he is the person then they can't be no more than that because if you look in the Bible because I remember I knew that in the Baptist Church I I I wouldn't educate it but I could read sensibly you know they called him John the Baptist this is right that's what it says John the Baptist well I told the Baptist the Deacon is the preacher of the people you know well we're Baptist called John was a Baptist well first off I'd put you under the law because that's where he was at right Jesus Christ hadn't come he introduced you I said second off the word v means singular because it can't be no more Baptists you know what I'm saying John be Baptist means there's just one of them singular all right he was the fullness he was the person of God all right he's the spiritual Kingdom over the spirits that's in US future home because we were in him at the beginning God in the beginning when he thought of you and thought of others like that thought of himself of being tangible that was his thoughts so he expressed his thoughts by word he said let there be let there be and there was we were a part of him in the beginning what part of us was there are we Mormons that believe in pre-existence of Souls do we believe in transmigration or souls or reincarnation or so go 154 Church 152 I think it's in the church a book he said I don't believe in that more yes 154. I don't believe in that Mormon doctrine of pre-existence well that didn't mean he didn't and like a brother said one day he said he didn't say he didn't believe in some form I said amen he believed in some form of pre-existence I do too I believe Jesus Christ pre-existed because he was on my Almighty not the human flesh the one that was in the flesh pre-existed because he's the only one that could pre-exist and if his name is Elohim which is what it was meaning self-existing then we would not be back there as people we were only in his thoughts we were attributes a part of him why because when he died I died with him right when he went to hell I went to hell with him right because I was in him now it's out of that you you got a problem right but now listen God knew what he would do the prophet said it on Christ is revealing his own word that we were in him in germ form you remember that through the series the prophet deals with genes he deals with germs he deals with seed a gene is not a germ a germ is not a seed a seed takes egg and sperm to be a seed right the words got to be germinated all right when he was crucified we was crucified in his body when he rose from the dead we rose with him and now since we have recognized it now we sit together with him in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Christ revealing his own word then we were in him from the beginning and when Jesus became the word then we were part of him then there you are when that's in there there is no devil no powers no nothing can ever move it that's the post of the Soul and when it comes to that top host it's tied to the word why is it the people of this message are so flip-floppy somebody come along with a new doctor and everybody runs to it come on 40 something years I was thinking the other day about it you know us it's been around a while we'd be good historians right you know what a historian does a historian can tell you about history well you know most of his history is not experienced it's reading what somebody else say it so he becomes a historian but we're historians by being historians we lived it Danny we've been here brother collie we've seen all the doctrines come and go we've seen the people be led astray to even people that brother random call their names Go off into false doctrines or like it is now trying to prove them wrong in every which way you know if you're back there the same old people is down here trying to prove him wrong if you're back there with Jesus you know which side you'd be on why that Jesus he got mad he got planted them ropes and he went in that Temple and he beat them out of there like I had one brother to tell me he said well he said I don't believe he beat the people he said he beat the animals I said you're worse than ever what the animal got to do with the people put him in there right I'm sorry but ain't that sensible he's beating the people when he turned around and died on the cross for him now you explain that one you do it that way you start out to beat the people and you know you ain't gonna beat them right and listen brother said lean not to your own understanding 65. and God listen and the only way you can be a Son of God or a daughter of God you had to be a part of God and what and God isn't complete without you if you have a part of God in you by the new birth and that's what it's supposed to be right it's supposed to be Christ in you the hope of glory amen supposed to be the person of Jesus Christ Living in you that Paul said it's not I that liveth what but I live by the one that's inside of me all right he said but that's just making it too much what get that Catholic Doctrine out of your mind get with the word remember they said that to Jesus he said well you know the prophets were God and said they spoke of the sons of God and if I say I'm a son of God now who gives you the right say I'm not now if I go out and live like the devil you got a right to say that period right come on but God isn't complete without you you know why because there's only one resource of eternal life and that is God and God alone has eternal life now you were a part of him and so much that you're an attribute or in his thinking in the beginning that because he thought of you in the beginning it gives that little tug towards him can I say tug can I say seed get a safe spot and it be saying the same thing a little tug to him what a representation from predestination if I have eternal life today if you have eternal life I put it back in your pocket if you have eternal life that eternal life always was eternal you can't have a beginning of eternal life come on get out of Catholicism okay gives a little tug toward him that's what has to be quickened some of them will never be quickened they just don't have it some will never be quick and why because they reject for some reason and the biggest reason is the preachers why did the prophet say the little woman there one of them was prostitute or one to them he said she's seen so much religion until she turned to prostitution religious in the preachers you know what you get Tales of these preachers you know in their polygamist ideas you know what they're still welcomed when a man with a word ain't welcome to come in the churches and preach but those who are polygamists in everything in the world bigamist higamus and what Commission or anything else they're welcomed they're Brothers or somebody standing true with the word of God is not even welcomed one of these days I'll get back to preach about the faithful Ministry and what they are because I believe if the prophet taught the five-fold ministry is predestinated now that don't mean everybody that says they're a preacher is a preacher it's the ones that's predestinated they're the preachers all right listen God of this evil age I died with him for I was him in him then the whole godhead bodily shaped up in the person of Jesus Christ and when Jesus Christ died at the cross I died with him for I was in him then for he is the fullness of the word manifested knowing that we would be manifested later you hold on to that one God of this evil age paragraph 67-68 knowing that we would be may be manifested later and we was at Calvary with him we went into grave with him and we raised with him and his resurrection and now we're ascended by his holy spirit to the throne of grace sitting together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus now we know we was not there physically so what's he talking about if he was the fullness of the word you agreed that while ago now come on so now let's see if you agree with it he was the fullness of the word that meant all the word was in him that means if we got anything to be made enough visited it was in him if David had anything to be made manifested Moses Noah it was in him right all we got to do is just get out I really love that scripture I wonder how many people even know what it said he says I in you right that's easy to understand right I in you that's the new birth right he comes down to Elton unit but what about the next part of that scripture I in you and you in me now that's what Jesus said so you argue with him about it so I was in him on the shores of Galilee but you know what I was there when Moses crossed the Red Sea but you know where I was at too I was with George Washington when he crossed to Delaware in the same quote come on because he was the fullness of the word spoken words original seat back at 420. notice what Harmony Jesus never did anything until sin of the father or the father showed him first now is that scripture did Jesus say that he said I do nothing until the father shows me now is that Bible okay now listen notice what Harmony Jesus never did anything until scene of the father or the father showed him first Harmony between God and Christ see John 5 19. so will the bride and he shows her his Word of Life he shows her and she receives it she never doubts it nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again amen then I got a great big Hallelujah here is the secret well listen the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ come on what is the mind of Christ baptism when the Holy Ghost right to know what he wants done with a word and she does it in his name she has thus saith the Lord and it's germatized so the Holy Spirit watches Waters in until it's grown and serves its purpose they do only his will no one can persuade them different they have thus saith the Lord or they keep still well I'm going to do this brother Dale I'm going to do that what do you think about it now what have I always told you about that you come tell me I'm going to do this I'm going to do that sister Gail I ain't gonna say a word because you just told me what you're going to do you didn't ask me what you want to do what I wanted to be done you didn't ask me what the word said I'm not I'm just brother collie okay I'll argue with him you see the point of what I'm trying to get at all right think about it we have thus saith the Lord or we keep still I feel like going down to so and so what do you think about it goodbye you just told me you felt like it but when you felt like it you walked out when you felt like it your body's just hanging around right and you're in the way if nothing else we need the seats for the devil to sit on come on I know I'm arrogant hey fellow dude but is it the truth have I become your enemy because I tell you the truth I feel like I'm just going to go over here to this church amen so long I ain't never told nobody not to go nowhere and ain't never told nobody that's lost cause it went show me on the tapes they're here from 82 up to now anyway and I got the notes from their back the that's your choice to where you go to church it's not my choice but when you tell me you're planning on doing why you're going to tell me that why don't you just wave goodbye and say brother Dale I'm leaving okay listen there is a word according to the unveiling of God paragraph 129. there is a word for each age and Moses come forth his face shined the word was in him ready to be manifested give out to the people do you see it wherever the word is it's veiled the word has always been veiled it's veiled right now do you think the world can see the word now come on Jared I can read it every day you and I read it but we got a trinity out of it right but see there's a word for each age and there's got there's it's veiled Moses walked out there he had to put a veil over his face it was so spiritually as we'd call it in the presence of almighty God his face glowed and they couldn't stand to look at him but you know what one day that was no longer on his face anymore right oh they were scared while it's on his face oh we wouldn't dare do anything Moses we went there too but today that light was off of his face did Moses change and here come ahold of preachers around right about 250 of them I remember one time no dathan and core I believe was the ones that said it though in one situation Moses you take too much upon yourself we're all spiritual they wouldn't adire said that when that Halo was over his face they wouldn't have died say what they're saying today brother random while he was alive right 300 preachers one time when he preached on water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ when they challenged him on it in 300 preachers names that we could call we want the tapes we're going to send it everywhere why because it was right there in his presence but after then he said not one of them come back you see that's the way it is and I know even for my own personal experience I want to see somebody stand in front of my face and call me a liar about something because I'm going to look you dead in the eye and I'm going to say I can prove you're wrong brother Dale you said so and so the other day you will get the tape and we'll listen to it then if I didn't say it you're the liar then what are you going to do about it if I said it then I can show you in there that I made of a human mistake what you see people won't stand in front of the word why is it what's wrong with it today but the prophet said I'll be glad when the church comes to the place that she'll say Paul didn't say that but brother Dale that's their that's their opinion you're just against everybody no I'm not I'm against sin in you and me and the sin I'm against is unbelief if you're committing adultery if you're out running around gambling smoking and doing all of these things you better believe one thing for sure you're not getting by with it God's got a record I don't have to preach on it for you to see that it's wrong go to write them on Daniel 70 weeks says we know polygamy is wrong you don't need somebody to tell you he said right well yet they're Brothers Hey Brother so-and-so he's completely but did you hear what he's saying yeah dumb donkey talked a lot of times too let me hurry Feast of the trumpets and each age has allotted the word for each age that would be on the Earth he loted it in the church ages and the Seven Seals revealed every bit of it look where he's tying it to let me get one more then we'll pick these up his season because I got too many more left man here they are just turn on the lights reaching 64. each age God has lauded so much of his word for each age and he always sends somebody to manifest that word we'll take it right there this afternoon they won't have to use the 30-something quotes I got for the next message we'll still be on this but do you understand what I'm talking about church just trying to preach instead of maybe me read some but not you look at it because I realize the human mind you're going up and down the screen and you're seeing it and you're down here reading at the bottom because it's highlighted and you're not listening to what I'm saying I know you're not because I talk to you well I didn't know you said that I'm sorry but I'm not sorry for the word that I've tried to preach and that way that I've tried to bring it may be a problem but that dumb donkey tell you the truth you've got to listen to the Donkey see I've just tried to be honest and straight as I can to talk to you about it because I believe in predestination yes I believe in a predestinated seed that comes predestinated eternally from God and I believe that it lands in certain people and they make that seed manifest but do you have to put spots and spats and this and that those are terminologies to express not trying to show a better way that he should have said it this way I didn't say that he said it the only way that the Holy Spirit won't it say it you know I brought around and said a lot of things the way he said it because the holy spirit said say it you know why because that way people could twist it any way they wanted to I've asked you to do one thing go to the questions and answers from conduct order and Doctrine and read the questions that were asked to profit some of those things it was asked when he finished you knew no more about what was said than you did to start with let's get to go do it because the whole it was said one time about him said you told this group of people this and you told that that he said I told them what they wanted to hear he didn't say thus saith the Lord he said I just told him what they wanted to hear as a matter of fact I think it was tied to to childbearing you see one coming up and said the doctor told my wife for not to have no more kids okay and that's what they told us we would have never had but one child period there was a doctors that was their proof there was nothing back there in in those days when weighed 54 years old today I called and told him happy birthday 54 years ago they didn't have all these fields and drugs that they got today my wife had the Rh factor in her blood and I my blood was a positive and it wouldn't match Wade and Terence both had the yellow John to effect which come from that they told us never to have but one child that it could be anything from now on any deformity whatsoever we had a exact right by the prophet to say we're not going to have any more Terence bye you didn't get here Anna but see we believe God and we prayed that's why there's five years between Wade and Terence there's nine years between Terence and Anna you ever take a little bit as close to those ages when the second one come along they said don't have no more that it could be anything in the world when I've told you what happened Layton Terrence both was born before we come in the message and it was born after we come in the message we begin to see what it was to believe by faith so when Anna become I mean when Nanny become expecting she went to the doctor and you've heard the story the doctor says get your husband to go and see exactly where the blood count is at it's you're a negative with a r error negative with an RH on it and said he's positive so I go over they run the test go back to the doctor she does got a new doctor happened to be in that day you know assistant he said oh how wonderful said you're a negative said your husband is that is negative RH hers with rhs9 was negative she said you better go back and check your records because my husband was tested twice by you and it's positive he went in there and he come back he said they made a mistake said go over there and do it again I went back and they done it again come back and they said we don't know what happened but now you are a negative I gave gallon pins at General Motors under a positive but now my blood is A negative why because God changed the same because Anna was to come right can I quote a little bit without being up hateful in my wife taking it the wrong way you know what rode around and said he said if there's a seed to come through you and your wife won't have it that's paraphrasing the quote but it's close enough it don't mean you can go out and adultery and bring it that might be why a lot of women passed off the scene too quick Do What You Won't Do I'm quoting your prophet but you see Anna wound up to be healthy she was the only one out of the three that didn't have the other effect come on musician she didn't have the other fact why because the blood was a total match you tell me that's medically impossible I say Amen your blood can't change and a nurse come walking down right there ask her is it medically possible to go from a positive to a negative what you see I just happen to believe and you know what we was praying see we didn't get in all this where you could find out what the kids are going to be you know Dad got up that far yet of course we couldn't afford it to run the test but so when it wound up had a little girl she weighed 10 pounds my wife had done had one ten pound boy that was Terence two ounces weight was nine pound 13 ounces and when I went in there and told her she said we got another boy I said honey and the boy's a girl she said I don't know of course she was in and out you know how he had a little shot day I don't believe it you know what I done I said nurse go get the baby I said pull the clothes off the baby well yeah what you see he'd already told me saw a little boy about that size they would have Brew the most saw a little girl about that size a long black hair this is way before this ever come to pie well you know what brother Moulton him had a little boy and his name's Forest and him and Anna's pretty close at the same age I don't know exactly but and we had the little girl see we couldn't have had no boys we could have had too many boys in between maybe but it meant for that little girl to come I'm a firm believer in predestination but he showed me before they overcome what they'd be why do we worry about it when God didn't command let's stand for let's just say one verse or something anybody have a need it's 12 o'clock I'm sorry I also swore I wasn't going to preach so long anybody have a knee before we go oh Lord I believe we give our sister a prayer claw cause she's worried about the girl Lord we just ask you that come on the same in touch and deliver that person from that problem with internets and the things where they're on their Facebooks and things we ask you father in the name of Jesus Christ to take care of you amen anybody else will there Ernie Miller asked me to announce to the church and tell them to please pray for a kind of a personal thing in his life about somebody in his family so you just pray about it okay the Lord would take care of him oh father we reach down and we touch our little sister and condemn this fixed on one problem ask you to take it away we send this prayer called food okay what you're asking foreign believer so now be it unto her according to what she believes in Jesus anybody else you dismissed members of service this afternoon
