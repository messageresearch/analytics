[31:07] I told sister Brenda downstairs I said
[31:09] and uh somebody else was standing there
[31:11] brother Donnie I think it was um
[31:13] you know Jesus I could make this sermon
[31:17] the the title verily verily
[31:21] our brother random said if God said
[31:23] something twice you better listen to him
[31:25] well Daddy asked me to preach a couple
[31:29] days ago you know so I got to thinking
[31:31] and and he was we were talking about
[31:33] what I was going to preach in Saint
[31:34] Augustine so I want you to preach on the
[31:36] appearing in the coming well something
[31:37] struck me at work Friday morning so
[31:39] you're going to hear this morning's
[31:40] sermon all over again
[31:42] he didn't know that but that's okay God
[31:44] did so maybe somebody didn't get it this
[31:47] morning maybe you'll get it in a simpler
[31:50] way maybe this afternoon okay so if I
[31:53] say some of the same things just forgive
[31:55] me
[31:56] um it's what I had wrote down and I'm
[31:58] not going to change it because God
[31:59] didn't change it all right first John 2
[32:03] let's pray

[32:49] whatever you asked if Simon was asking
[32:51] him to come to the to the party there

[33:46] and now little children abide in him
[33:48] that when he shall appear we may have
[33:51] confidence and not be ashamed before him
[33:55] at his coming all right second Timothy
[34:01] one
[34:03] just turn back just a little bit
[34:06] second Timothy one
[34:10] excuse me verse 10.
[34:14] verse 9.
[34:18] who have saved us and called us with a
[34:21] holy calling
[34:24] everybody got it second Timothy one
[34:26] who has saved us and called us with a
[34:28] holy calling not according to our works
[34:30] thank the Lord but according to his own
[34:33] purpose and Grace which has given us in
[34:35] Christ Jesus before the world began
[34:38] but it but
[34:40] that's nice to know
[34:43] Paul's saying that's nice to know that
[34:44] we were thought of before the foundation
[34:46] of the world but it's now made manifest
[34:49] in other words he's brought it down to
[34:51] present by the appearing
[34:54] all right of Our Savior Jesus Christ who
[34:57] has abolished death and has brought life
[34:59] and immortality to light through the
[35:02] gospel you may be seated in the Lord and
[35:03] his Blessing to the reading of the word
[35:08] thank you each one for being here good
[35:11] to see sister Regina
[35:14] if we had all these half timers and
[35:16] part-timers if y'all all come to church
[35:18] services we'd have enough people to have
[35:19] church
[35:21] and I'm not talking to Regina like that
[35:23] I'm talking to everybody right I just
[35:26] like to see everybody back somebody said
[35:27] something the other day and I said if
[35:29] the people that were just backsled and
[35:31] didn't come to church would all come
[35:32] here we'd have a crowd
[35:34] and the one that had left and and I know
[35:36] you know pray for brother Robbie he's
[35:38] trying to come back I prayed that boy
[35:41] for a long time
[35:43] that the Lord's gonna have to get him
[35:44] out get it just like he did me got to
[35:46] get him in a way to where he can't get
[35:48] out
[35:49] he did me sister and he got me in a way
[35:51] where I couldn't get out and I couldn't
[35:53] depend on my natural family to get me
[35:55] out I had to depend on my heavenly
[35:57] family when you depend on your heavenly
[35:59] family then that's the whole that's the
[36:01] whole deal you call for the heavenly
[36:04] father you're a natural father can help
[36:05] you so far but he can't help you in the
[36:09] way that your heavenly father can help
[36:10] you so we thank the Lord for uh
[36:13] everybody being him we love to see
[36:15] people here but today we're going to
[36:17] speak on his appearing
[36:19] Reveals His coming
[36:22] his appearing Reveals His coming all
[36:27] right because now brother Dale's been
[36:29] preaching on how the appearing and the
[36:30] coming is two different things and
[36:32] that's exactly the truth
[36:34] but also we see that if we take that
[36:36] same appearing
[36:38] it has something to do with his coming
[36:40] because without the appearing
[36:43] he's not going to come right
[36:46] without the appearing
[36:48] because remember appearing is what
[36:50] something you can see is something
[36:51] visible without his appearing we're not
[36:55] going to understand his coming right
[36:57] because you and I are just humans we
[36:59] have a we have a
[37:01] um a brain that we don't use most of the
[37:03] time
[37:05] and what part we do use is most the time
[37:07] wrong
[37:08] right or mine is anyway
[37:10] but that word appears there in in first
[37:14] John I love the little John's he was
[37:16] real
[37:18] um
[37:19] um
[37:19] real adamant about seeing God
[37:23] because he just got back from the Isle
[37:24] of Patmos and and he was being a pastor
[37:28] to the church there at Ephesus and he's
[37:31] saying just love everyone and and
[37:32] looking for the appearing and and just
[37:35] watch John as his attitude is is he just
[37:39] wants everybody to be saved but that
[37:41] part of appearing
[37:44] we saw that and you still probably got
[37:46] the quotes that brother Dale gave me I
[37:47] didn't bring any with me like that for
[37:49] that I just brought some little tidbits
[37:52] and you're gonna find out this sermon
[37:54] came from a most peculiar place in the
[37:57] Bible
[37:58] um I was uh
[38:01] yesterday I guess it was the day before
[38:02] I was sitting reading
[38:04] um
[38:05] brother Branham was preaching in 1956 he
[38:08] was preaching about the the
[38:12] um meanest man
[38:14] in the city
[38:16] and it was Simon
[38:18] that had invited Jesus to a feast and we
[38:22] know what happened with Mary and
[38:24] alibabaster box and all that well that
[38:26] just to me that shows the appearing
[38:29] and the coming and two groups of people
[38:31] there the woman that was a real Fame and
[38:34] the Pharisees that were supposed to be
[38:36] this religious group they saw him he
[38:39] appeared at the home
[38:41] but they missed his coming all right
[38:43] but now that woman
[38:45] type of the church that woman that was
[38:48] so deep and dark in sin
[38:51] she got the appearing and the coming
[38:54] because she typed us and we'll get to it
[38:56] in just a minute but that word there
[38:58] appear means to make known and if you
[39:00] look in some of those
[39:02] um things that that gave you the the
[39:05] quotes if you'll look up the one that
[39:07] says apocalypso which means Revelation
[39:10] right
[39:11] right and that is actually the Book of
[39:14] Revelations is actually in the original
[39:17] it is called the Apocalypse
[39:20] it's actually apocalypse the revelation
[39:22] of Jesus Christ are the apocalypse so
[39:25] the appearing means the revealing are to
[39:27] become visible visible to show be
[39:29] manifested to be this is what I like to
[39:32] be plainly recognized
[39:35] see now he could be recognized in many
[39:38] ways but to be plainly recognized and
[39:41] this end time is the only time I believe
[39:42] he was plainly recognized right right
[39:45] plainly Vindicated
[39:48] and then the one of them is up to nomia
[39:52] where you get the word Optometry which
[39:55] is what you go see the optometrist the
[39:57] eye doctor
[39:58] our vision when when Elijah and Moses
[40:02] appeared on the mount Transfiguration in
[40:04] the Bible that word appeared is
[40:09] which is vision
[40:11] what you see
[40:13] now
[40:15] keep these two words in mind keep this
[40:17] phrase in mind during the whole the
[40:19] whole sermon
[40:21] we must have revelation
[40:24] before manifestation right
[40:27] that's right we must have revelation
[40:31] before manifestation or we must have
[40:34] appearing before coming right right all
[40:37] right now
[40:39] brother Branham said in the Bible it
[40:42] spoke of Jesus's coming since the Book
[40:45] of Genesis right you say how do you get
[40:47] that all right look it's the way the way
[40:50] God appeared
[40:53] in the Old Testament was revealing part
[40:56] of his coming right
[40:58] because remember he comes three times
[41:01] he came first time to redeem us right
[41:04] right then to get us right and then come
[41:07] back with us right all right now
[41:10] he came in the Book of Genesis he was
[41:14] trying to reveal himself right if Eve
[41:17] would have waited for the program of God
[41:19] to take effect
[41:21] God would have come right there to those
[41:24] people in the way he wanted to in people
[41:29] right not in animals
[41:31] not indoors or or you know things of the
[41:35] world he wanted to come in people
[41:38] but when he did what she did
[41:41] that didn't stop the plan of God that
[41:43] actually made the plan of God more
[41:44] manifest right right and actually to me
[41:47] it made it more simple
[41:49] it made it more simple to see that how
[41:51] God wanted us all saved we had a choice
[41:55] and he is predestinating because of that
[41:58] choice and he sees the end from the
[42:00] beginning right so he's going to make
[42:02] the end be the same as the beginning
[42:04] like we read this morning in Bible study
[42:07] and Sunday school class that the word
[42:09] God the word God in the beginning is the
[42:12] same word as God in Revelations 22 that
[42:15] same God is spelled the same
[42:17] capitalization and everything that has
[42:20] come from the beginning he says I'm
[42:22] Alpha and Omega the beginning and the
[42:25] end well when it said in the beginning
[42:26] God made Heaven and the Earth is the
[42:28] same God but what's he done
[42:32] he's brought it right together but in
[42:34] between that is a journey
[42:37] that's one of it we can take the
[42:39] appearing and let it reveal is coming
[42:41] because it can be a Journey Through Time
[42:44] to show you and I who us no God right
[42:50] amen all right now
[42:54] but he appeared to many remember the
[42:56] Bible says after his resurrection they
[42:58] saw him
[43:00] but did they get the Revelation I don't
[43:02] think so I don't think so
[43:05] but now
[43:07] let's keep this in the back of your mind
[43:10] Satan can impersonate
[43:12] the appearing right yeah amen but he
[43:15] cannot impersonate
[43:17] the coming right when it's to you the
[43:21] reason I said that is we're going to
[43:22] read in Thessalonians where he said he's
[43:24] going to come down as an angel of Light
[43:26] and deceive he's coming same c-o-m-i-n-g
[43:30] is the same one that talks about Jesus
[43:31] talks about the Antichrist coming
[43:34] all right so be careful let's just don't
[43:37] say this Parsi is just God's presence
[43:39] you take that and run it all the way
[43:40] through the Bible and it does it says
[43:42] the same thing about the Antichrist he's
[43:44] coming
[43:45] as an angel of life right to deceive you
[43:48] right and if you hadn't caught the
[43:51] coming of Jesus Christ you're going to
[43:53] get that coming that's right
[43:55] okay everybody understand that that's
[43:57] okay but Satan can impersonate the
[44:00] period appearing because what is that
[44:01] that's a sense
[44:04] we see to our eyes
[44:08] but now let's look in the Old Testament
[44:10] let's start with Cain you know you know
[44:12] me and the way I do things I try to
[44:14] start in Genesis and try to end up in
[44:16] Revelation
[44:17] so in the Book of Genesis you see Cain
[44:20] what did Cain what did he put all of his
[44:24] emphasis on
[44:26] revelation
[44:29] appearance
[44:32] appearance
[44:35] what did Satan want more than Michael
[44:39] he wanted a kingdom that appeared better
[44:41] yeah than Michaels
[44:44] so there started in heaven dropped right
[44:45] down on Earth what did King do
[44:48] King started building an altar just like
[44:52] Abel
[44:53] but what he wanted to put on it was
[44:55] something that looked good to the eye
[44:58] that was beautiful it was enticing
[45:02] that he thought he could draw God to him
[45:07] look at Abel
[45:10] Abel got a revelation of something and
[45:14] it's very important what that Revelation
[45:16] is right because it's going to hold from
[45:18] the beginning to the end right and
[45:20] that's blood right amen glory that's the
[45:24] blood
[45:26] Cain did not get a revelation of the
[45:28] blood right he saw the appearance oh
[45:32] this is going to look good mom and dad
[45:34] are really going to enjoy this
[45:37] God you you're gonna have to accept my
[45:40] sacrifice because I have put all the
[45:43] potatoes in the right place I've got the
[45:45] right color he was a Master Gardener I'm
[45:47] sure
[45:48] he had all the flowers arranged over
[45:50] here the blue ones over here the red
[45:52] ones over here the pink one's over here
[45:53] I bet it looked beautiful
[45:55] walk in the Roman Catholic Church
[45:58] you'll see that same
[46:01] thing that Cain did
[46:03] the same things the same devil Same
[46:05] Spirit that was in Cain just came down
[46:07] in the Catholic church and they put the
[46:09] brightest the most beautiful colors and
[46:11] they have everything what appearance
[46:13] they want that Pope to appear right they
[46:16] want him to appear with the Rings and
[46:17] all the signals and all those things but
[46:20] what did Abel get
[46:22] he got a revelation of the coming of
[46:25] Jesus Christ right
[46:27] because he did it through the blood
[46:29] it had to be a lamb sacrifice
[46:33] it had to be something dirty not dirty
[46:36] as far as what we know but you
[46:37] understand it doesn't look clean
[46:39] it did not look good so it wasn't the
[46:42] appearing
[46:44] you got it
[46:46] right it wasn't appearing
[46:49] it was a revelation of what had happened
[46:51] right and what was going to bring them
[46:53] back into the garden right with a blood
[46:57] right now we know that was the
[46:59] substitutionary blood right let's go and
[47:01] get that mixed up but it spoke of
[47:03] something right that it would be blood
[47:05] all the way down and blood was what was
[47:07] going to put us back into the Garden of
[47:09] Eden right all right non-appearance
[47:13] that's what the Catholic Church things
[47:14] they think they're going to get back
[47:15] into heaven because everything looks so
[47:17] good everything's so beautiful
[47:18] everything's in order everything's so
[47:20] nice all the colors are all you know
[47:22] they're just beautiful
[47:25] Stephen John on the Isle of Patmos had
[47:27] to stop and admire it he was a boarding
[47:29] in Christian
[47:31] he stopped and admired that that
[47:35] now
[47:37] so we see that Abel saw
[47:40] he saw past
[47:44] the appearing right
[47:47] to the coming amen
[47:49] amen all right
[47:50] because the first comment has to be
[47:51] blood
[47:52] this last coming's gonna have to be
[47:54] blessed or this coming not the last but
[47:57] to this coming
[47:58] right right and then read Revelations 19
[48:01] he comes back riding with us in the
[48:05] Millennium on a white horse with white
[48:07] on his
[48:08] thank you
[48:10] blood right on his vesture all right
[48:15] Joyce the blood we'll never you and I
[48:17] will never forget the blood right we may
[48:19] forget all the appearances and all the
[48:20] things like that but you'll never forget
[48:22] the blood of Jesus Christ is what's
[48:24] going to put us into Glory all right
[48:26] now
[48:29] God appeared to Abraham
[48:32] in a form
[48:34] that he could see
[48:37] but now remember God became visible to
[48:41] Abraham right
[48:43] but that's not the same visible God that
[48:46] you and I see right man
[48:48] he said now you're talking about two
[48:50] guards no you're remember let's look at
[48:52] this the eye thing look at look look
[48:55] Abraham saw Melchizedek
[48:57] all right Glory
[48:59] we don't worship Melchizedek
[49:01] we worship what Melchizedek become right
[49:04] right we know but what was that that was
[49:06] a journey of Jesus Christ coming down so
[49:09] that he could walk in human flesh and it
[49:11] not Shock us
[49:13] folks I believe the whole if you just if
[49:16] you just asked me to sum up the message
[49:19] of the hour the whole Bible the whole
[49:21] Plan of Redemption is God
[49:25] did this whole thing to make it so
[49:28] simple
[49:29] that an illiterate person that can't
[49:32] even read or write
[49:34] that will believe in him he'll put them
[49:37] in the Kingdom of Glory come on
[49:39] you can talk about seals and clings and
[49:41] vials and trumpets and Dana 70 weeks
[49:43] that's okay and that's needed right but
[49:46] when it comes down to where the rubber
[49:47] meets the road is is you have to believe
[49:50] in that blood
[49:51] and an illiterate person you can tell
[49:54] him about Jesus Christ and what he did
[49:55] for him and he God can birth him in the
[49:57] Kingdom
[49:59] all right so let's don't make this thing
[50:02] too high well we can't see it
[50:04] are too low but we don't have to see it
[50:07] but he appeared
[50:10] spoke of his
[50:12] company right right amen Abraham meeting
[50:15] God in human flesh
[50:18] spoke of what would happen when God
[50:20] would come literally in his first coming
[50:22] and his second coming right right and
[50:25] his third coming is going to be God in
[50:27] human flesh with what a bunch of little
[50:29] gods in human flesh
[50:31] all right but it's one true Living God
[50:33] right all right everybody okay
[50:38] Shake Yourself and wake up a little bit
[50:41] but in all the Old Testament the reason
[50:43] that God was above us in the Old
[50:46] Testament is he couldn't come down into
[50:48] the individual because of that
[50:50] substitutionary blood right was just
[50:53] pushing
[50:54] send back to when he would come the
[50:57] first time right
[50:59] but it all was in part
[51:02] we know in part we prophesy in part but
[51:04] that which is what perfect has come all
[51:07] right that which is in part will be done
[51:09] away well that's what happened in it
[51:10] from the Old Testament to the New
[51:11] Testament and now that happened you and
[51:13] I in this end time
[51:15] that which is perfect to come that which
[51:17] is in part you don't do away with a
[51:19] seven Church ages you don't do away with
[51:21] all the Old Testament but it's done away
[51:23] because why you don't see that anymore
[51:25] you see you and I right
[51:27] that's what I want you to see his
[51:29] appearing he appeared like brother down
[51:31] said he can appear to the Baptist the
[51:33] Methodist the Pentecostals and without a
[51:36] new birth they will miss his coming
[51:38] right that's right he's only going to
[51:41] come and get one special group of people
[51:43] that's right
[51:45] that's who he's coming for amen all
[51:47] right
[51:50] and I just want to lay something in here
[51:51] just for a little I want you to think
[51:53] about this and I don't we're in a mixed
[51:55] crowd but the world has picked up on a
[51:57] lot of these things about the coming
[52:01] as far as God coming and and like Dad
[52:04] said it's a uniting
[52:07] come on and send it like brother Gerald
[52:09] is an invisible Union right it's God
[52:12] coming to his bride right right okay now
[52:14] I know we're in a mixed audience but
[52:16] there's a lot of things you can say
[52:17] about that that the world that which is
[52:19] worldly junk but it does mean something
[52:21] that God is coming to a group of people
[52:23] right he's coming to be intimate with a
[52:26] group of people hey amen not just to
[52:28] appear come on
[52:30] the appearing is nice come on but the
[52:34] coming
[52:35] see appearing is like brother Gerald
[52:37] said you can appear at my front door and
[52:39] come in but you're not going in the
[52:40] bedroom with me all right
[52:42] only my wife goes into that park right
[52:44] all right so he's trying to become
[52:46] intimate to get us out of the the the
[52:48] the kitchen and the and the living room
[52:50] hey living room is a wonderful place to
[52:52] sit and talk me and brother Donnie we
[52:54] can talk for hours and hours and hours
[52:55] about God and about uh guns and about
[52:58] hunting and whatever you know but when
[53:00] it comes about 10 o'clock at my house
[53:02] you need to go home that's right amen
[53:07] I told a group of people I'm not a group
[53:09] but a husband and wife one time when I
[53:10] was getting up real early going to work
[53:12] I told a group of people I said that was
[53:15] at the house I said look I said y'all
[53:16] sit up and talk to each other all night
[53:18] I said just lock the door when you leave
[53:20] but I'm going to bed
[53:23] and I think they left shortly thereafter
[53:25] but
[53:27] but you understand what I'm saying amen
[53:30] and entertain plenty of people in your
[53:32] in your living room right but you better
[53:34] not entertain but one person in that
[53:35] bedroom
[53:37] all right understand Jesus Christ has
[53:39] come to do one thing and that's to take
[53:41] a bride for himself right
[53:44] not another
[53:46] but for himself
[53:48] but he appeared to Abraham let me get
[53:50] finished I wasn't going to be I'm just
[53:51] going to be a little short today
[53:53] but in the Old Testament it was God
[53:55] above us
[53:56] even to sit down and Moses said he
[53:59] talked lit to ear
[54:01] face to face with God
[54:04] Moses never saw God like you and I are
[54:06] going to see God Amen right right
[54:08] because Moses wasn't a born-again
[54:10] Christian I don't understand why these
[54:12] people in the in the message well I do I
[54:14] do
[54:15] it's then they don't have a background
[54:17] they're not taught right okay all right
[54:21] that's the true Brother Gary I I'm sorry
[54:23] it's the truth uh I believe Dad tried to
[54:26] tell him that and The Minister's meeting
[54:27] kind of trying to do it kind of subtly
[54:29] instead of just coming right out and
[54:30] telling them he was trying to suddenly
[54:33] telling them said look if we don't get
[54:35] these virtues
[54:37] right how are you going to get them
[54:39] right we got to bring these virtues into
[54:42] US make them manifest before we can
[54:44] bring them to you right amen so that you
[54:47] can make it manifest right some of the
[54:49] brothers were saying hey why are people
[54:50] or you know why aren't our people still
[54:52] are stuck
[54:54] what Daddy was saying he'd said well
[54:57] you're stuck
[55:00] foreign
[55:01] thank God for a pastor right it's not
[55:04] stuck all right
[55:10] and you know what
[55:12] there's got to be somebody to pull off
[55:13] that gift that's right so don't think
[55:15] yourself yourself no lower you had to
[55:18] pull to get it out that's right okay so
[55:21] we may be the we may be the out scour of
[55:23] the message but who cares
[55:26] blessing all right
[55:29] but in Moses Moses saw him
[55:31] he appeared the Bible says and many
[55:33] times the Bible says God appeared
[55:36] remember God appeared to the people in
[55:38] The Burning to Moses in the burning bush
[55:40] but now did Moses see God he saw him for
[55:43] his time but he did not see the fullness
[55:46] of God he did not see God manifest in
[55:49] blood
[55:50] we're talking about blood here we got to
[55:52] get blood on the scene all right
[55:55] even melchizedek's blood
[56:02] even the blood that was going through
[56:05] melchizedek's veins was not the blood
[56:08] that saved me and you
[56:12] only the blood of that virgin born son
[56:16] of God Amen the one that was born and he
[56:20] was a son of
[56:21] can die for your sins if he wasn't a
[56:25] Kinsman he cannot take your place
[56:28] Melchizedek was not our Kinsmen now
[56:31] president was showing God and his
[56:33] journey down to man
[56:36] but he spoke that body in spoke that
[56:39] body out and that body is not my
[56:41] sacrifice today laying on the altar
[56:43] that's right all right not taking
[56:46] anything away from Melchizedek because
[56:48] there's a wonderful thing that
[56:49] Melchizedek did coming to the believer
[56:51] of that day right
[56:53] but a greater than Melchizedek is here
[56:55] amen
[56:57] whatever Melchizedek did a greater than
[57:00] he is here today right amen because we
[57:03] had a man come that had the blood of
[57:05] almighty God sinless took on our sin so
[57:09] that we can be sinless right
[57:11] and now it's in you and I right amen
[57:13] right
[57:16] he appeared to Daniel as the angel
[57:20] ain't showing that he
[57:22] that he judged
[57:24] but showing that he would appear to
[57:26] someone in the Old Testament but not be
[57:29] a coming
[57:33] hang on remember
[57:36] the first coming we got to get blood
[57:39] here there was no blood of God in the
[57:42] Old Testament right right that's why
[57:44] there was no Born Again believer in the
[57:45] Old Testament the Old Testament except
[57:47] Adam
[57:48] was imparted eternal life God created
[57:52] him right gave him eternal life the
[57:54] prophet said blasphemus name
[57:58] but in the Old Testament that's why the
[58:00] substitutionary blood couldn't save
[58:02] people because it was a blood of an
[58:05] animal right not the blood of a Kinsmen
[58:07] right once that Beast line was done away
[58:10] with there's no connection with man and
[58:12] an animal again right see while that
[58:15] Beast was there you could come all the
[58:16] way up through Creative Evolution right
[58:18] catch a beast and then catch a person he
[58:20] could either he could either uh
[58:22] procreate with the with a human or
[58:24] procreate with the animal but when God
[58:26] did away with that and put that division
[58:29] in there no more animal blood was going
[58:32] to take away sin it could push it back
[58:35] right but it couldn't take it away right
[58:37] all right but still though Abel had that
[58:40] revelation of the coming of God that God
[58:42] was going to have to come in blood
[58:45] right right
[58:47] to give his blood
[58:49] right to come back and bleed on you and
[58:51] I
[58:53] which is the bleeding word of God
[58:55] but now look
[58:57] all the prophets of the Old Testament
[58:59] spoke of his coming first coming
[59:03] but they only got the appearing
[59:07] the vision the sign
[59:09] the seeing
[59:11] everybody understand that
[59:13] it was the first coming he came in human
[59:15] flesh
[59:17] it had to be the blood of God
[59:19] all Prophet spoke of this that's why God
[59:22] was above us that's why Brother Gary God
[59:24] couldn't get in US
[59:26] he was above us in the Old Testament but
[59:28] when he came and gave his blood gave his
[59:31] life
[59:31] he could dwell in US right right and
[59:34] then come back and get us
[59:36] because of what he did right when he
[59:38] came here to redeem us that's right
[59:40] right
[59:41] I hope you see that because I want that
[59:43] dwell in your mind because it's going to
[59:45] help you know more and more as as we go
[59:47] forth I was just going to ride a couple
[59:48] of pages and I had to stop
[59:50] almost three pages of notes that that I
[59:54] got especially like off the sermon this
[59:56] morning
[59:58] but now listen
[1:00:00] think about this
[1:00:02] his first coming
[1:00:04] when he came as a baby when he came as
[1:00:06] Jesus Christ
[1:00:08] his first coming Vindicated
[1:00:10] that he did appear to all those Old
[1:00:13] Testament Saints
[1:00:16] do you understand that
[1:00:17] if he had not come like they said
[1:00:21] they would have all been Liars yeah and
[1:00:23] they would have missed his appearance
[1:00:24] right but they came down and as he
[1:00:27] appeared to each one Isaiah Ezekiel all
[1:00:31] those down through there
[1:00:33] Daniel Moses
[1:00:35] he was appearing to him
[1:00:37] showing a part of his self but he
[1:00:40] couldn't come into the person right
[1:00:41] because of that substitutionary blood
[1:00:43] was keeping with a buffer
[1:00:45] all right but when he came in human
[1:00:48] flesh that Vindicated
[1:00:51] the Old Testament right that Vindicated
[1:00:54] when he come on the scene that
[1:00:56] Vindicated right you're going to see
[1:00:57] that because then whatever made him
[1:00:59] vindicate with the prophets said in the
[1:01:02] Old Testament guess what in his second
[1:01:04] coming if he don't come the way that
[1:01:06] he's supposed to in the Bible
[1:01:08] that we missed the appearing in the
[1:01:10] coming both right
[1:01:12] right
[1:01:13] everybody understand that it is
[1:01:16] as the Old Testament prophesied and he
[1:01:19] comes down and he appeared Hebrews 10
[1:01:21] and 5.
[1:01:22] in the volume of the book is written of
[1:01:25] me what the Torah all the things that
[1:01:26] were written in the Old Testament right
[1:01:27] and the volume of that book was written
[1:01:29] that they were preparing a body right
[1:01:31] for God to dwell in amen amen and then
[1:01:35] God said hey I'm going to vindicate that
[1:01:36] because I'm going to do exactly what
[1:01:38] they said because that's me that said it
[1:01:39] right right right
[1:01:42] right this Bible cannot be fallible
[1:01:46] it must be infallible right now the
[1:01:50] person that that that's trying to reveal
[1:01:52] itself wrote it right so it's got to be
[1:01:55] perfect amen
[1:01:58] if this ain't perfect I'm gonna hold on
[1:01:59] to this
[1:02:01] right well this is going to get us
[1:02:03] somewhere amen
[1:02:05] but he hid in all those many forms
[1:02:09] but there was no Union in the Old
[1:02:12] Testament between God and man right
[1:02:15] he would anoint
[1:02:17] that's right and then it would come off
[1:02:19] right he would anoint Moses and and they
[1:02:22] would have to Veil his face he was so
[1:02:25] close amen
[1:02:26] so close to God
[1:02:29] to what Moses spoke was what God was
[1:02:32] thinking right Moses just spoke
[1:02:35] but yet
[1:02:37] when that anointing came off Moses
[1:02:40] he could kill an Egyptian he could Smite
[1:02:43] a rock see what the Holy Ghost he
[1:02:45] wouldn't have Smith The Rock that's
[1:02:46] right he would have done what God said
[1:02:47] he spoke to the rocks say but he didn't
[1:02:50] do that
[1:02:52] there had to be a denomination set up
[1:02:54] you say boy denomination well that's
[1:02:57] what Cain did yeah right
[1:03:01] denominations they get his appearing
[1:03:04] people yeah and let me let me get a
[1:03:06] little closer
[1:03:08] if you're not born again this morning
[1:03:09] afternoon that's right you just see the
[1:03:12] appearance that's right you just the
[1:03:14] carnival amen
[1:03:15] the bright lights and you know what's
[1:03:18] wrong everybody going around the ferris
[1:03:20] wheel having a good time right but until
[1:03:23] you get in that Ferris wheel
[1:03:25] you're just an onlooker come on brother
[1:03:27] you're not a participant come on Amen so
[1:03:31] you're just looking from afar off that's
[1:03:33] right
[1:03:34] and you're gonna miss his coming just
[1:03:36] like the rest of the people
[1:03:38] you said oh I'm right in the coming of
[1:03:40] the Lord this is the coming of the Lord
[1:03:41] I'm right in it but I don't want to ride
[1:03:43] that ride come on
[1:03:45] I don't think I'm gonna go in there and
[1:03:47] get a ticket for that
[1:03:48] that'd be too hard
[1:03:50] no oh my you gotta take it off people
[1:03:53] that's right
[1:03:58] but now God is with us now
[1:04:00] he was above us
[1:04:02] he was with us when he appeared in
[1:04:05] coming forth from a virgin
[1:04:10] the appearing
[1:04:12] all those appearances down through the
[1:04:14] Old Testament
[1:04:15] remember what the word appearing means
[1:04:17] reveal make known make manifest
[1:04:21] all right
[1:04:22] and now you can see too even in the New
[1:04:24] Testament
[1:04:25] and don't get me wrong I I followed the
[1:04:28] line and I may take another line on that
[1:04:30] later on but
[1:04:33] I think it was Jude or one of them said
[1:04:34] at the appearing
[1:04:36] well see the appearing in the coming is
[1:04:38] now to come together
[1:04:40] there used to be an appearing all right
[1:04:43] and a comment all right and a journey in
[1:04:45] between
[1:04:46] I'm just what I'm going through now but
[1:04:48] in the end time now the appearing and
[1:04:50] the coming is together right
[1:04:52] because when he appears we appear with
[1:04:55] him right see so let's just don't stay
[1:04:57] with a peer that appears bad
[1:05:00] and coming is good
[1:05:02] in the end time the appearing in the
[1:05:04] coming comes together all right
[1:05:06] you see God
[1:05:08] and he is God Amen I'm pointing to
[1:05:11] brother Danny
[1:05:13] I have no problem with that right
[1:05:16] I know it's hard for you to believe
[1:05:18] I'm talking to Joyce
[1:05:26] best therapist Danny ever had
[1:05:30] absolutely
[1:05:33] but even when God himself appeared on
[1:05:36] Earth
[1:05:37] it was hid
[1:05:40] even his first coming right
[1:05:42] everything that the Old Testament spoke
[1:05:44] of
[1:05:47] he walked right out and said here I am
[1:05:50] and they did not believe it that's right
[1:05:52] because they missed the appearing part
[1:05:56] right all right
[1:05:57] now
[1:05:59] see if you can swallow this
[1:06:02] the first coming was in a process
[1:06:06] and he'd come up to the River Jordan
[1:06:10] and he'd come up to a place to where God
[1:06:12] said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[1:06:14] pleased to dwell all right all right
[1:06:18] and now after that
[1:06:20] he began preaching right right but what
[1:06:24] did he preach on
[1:06:26] did he preach on his
[1:06:28] coming
[1:06:30] first
[1:06:31] here
[1:06:33] are the one coming the second coming
[1:06:37] remember brother Adam said he preached
[1:06:40] 90 of his sermon
[1:06:42] was when the son of man when the son of
[1:06:44] well the son of man was standing there
[1:06:46] right but they weren't getting it right
[1:06:48] they weren't getting it that's right so
[1:06:51] he was prophesying
[1:06:53] of a group coming
[1:06:55] right oh I was thinking about this the
[1:06:57] other day
[1:06:58] people don't understand the little
[1:06:59] stories that brother Branham tells he
[1:07:01] comes up to the questions and answers on
[1:07:03] the seals and remember he starts talking
[1:07:05] about God and simplicity again he starts
[1:07:08] talking about he said through this
[1:07:09] building
[1:07:11] is people
[1:07:13] right he said angels
[1:07:17] he said but it's like a radio
[1:07:20] and in a radio especially back then not
[1:07:23] now back then your radio had a little
[1:07:26] crystal in it a diamond
[1:07:29] I'll give you a little story true story
[1:07:31] I don't know what it is now it may be
[1:07:33] electronically fixed but in your
[1:07:37] dial when you come across to a place
[1:07:40] Aaron can probably tell you about it
[1:07:41] there was a crystal
[1:07:43] diamond and it was cut a certain way and
[1:07:46] that picked up that megahertz or that
[1:07:48] sound wave and it transferred it into
[1:07:51] your speakers and that's that's why you
[1:07:52] got 55 am 55 you got am 750 you got 680
[1:07:57] you got 1280 you got 1100 on the FM side
[1:08:00] what that's the megahertz that that that
[1:08:02] that that dial is set up to to receive
[1:08:07] now that's what brother Brown was
[1:08:08] explaining
[1:08:10] but right before that he said
[1:08:12] he said from you
[1:08:14] and you're not going to get it right
[1:08:17] right remember he started telling him he
[1:08:19] starts home he said it's not for you he
[1:08:20] said he said just go on live a good
[1:08:22] simple Christian life then he goes right
[1:08:24] into the to the dial and I thought well
[1:08:26] praise God
[1:08:28] what brother Brandon was saying is he
[1:08:30] said there's nobody sitting there that
[1:08:32] day that was in tune
[1:08:34] with what he was saying
[1:08:36] but there was a group of people coming
[1:08:39] and I'm one of that group
[1:08:42] amen that God could dial it in yes and
[1:08:45] he cut me the right way
[1:08:47] 40 years later it may have been sister
[1:08:49] Brenda but he dialed that dial
[1:08:52] and each one of us
[1:08:55] picked up amen amen the receptor
[1:08:58] right right that's what he was telling
[1:09:00] him people he wasn't just talking about
[1:09:02] a radio station right
[1:09:04] he was talking about that God was a was
[1:09:06] appearing through that building and
[1:09:08] through that little Prophet but they
[1:09:10] were missing it because they didn't have
[1:09:12] the right crystal
[1:09:13] he didn't say anyone born again
[1:09:16] he said they didn't have the right
[1:09:17] receptor
[1:09:19] to pick it up
[1:09:20] but you know what if you and I get it in
[1:09:22] the end time he was talking about me and
[1:09:24] you sorry we had the right we have the
[1:09:27] right receptor to pick it up now but his
[1:09:30] ministry spoke of his second coming more
[1:09:32] than his first coming why
[1:09:34] because the prophets had already told
[1:09:36] about it first coming right he didn't
[1:09:38] have to dwell sure he would say
[1:09:40] something about Moses but who who was he
[1:09:42] talking to Pharisees right he said Moses
[1:09:45] in your law says right yearbook go read
[1:09:48] what Moses said about me yeah man yeah
[1:09:51] but he also spoke of the second coming
[1:09:54] but this is where I got this this part
[1:09:57] that I was
[1:09:59] you know looking at the other day at
[1:10:01] work and
[1:10:03] because God appeared to the Pharisees
[1:10:07] now here's the coming of first coming of
[1:10:09] Jesus Christ God in human flesh he's on
[1:10:12] Earth
[1:10:13] and he's doing a job
[1:10:16] he's sowing the seed of the of the
[1:10:18] Kingdom right he was the son of man who
[1:10:19] saw the seed so in the seed sowing the
[1:10:21] word sowing you and I aren't showing the
[1:10:24] word so that you and I can grow and
[1:10:26] nurture but he walks up to a group of
[1:10:28] Pharisees one day
[1:10:32] and Simon one of the Pharisees was
[1:10:34] having a gathering
[1:10:35] and he asked Jesus to come
[1:10:39] but the reason he asked Jesus to come
[1:10:42] was was to ridicule him
[1:10:45] not to make him known
[1:10:48] right
[1:10:50] now the greatest religious group
[1:10:54] Simon was a well read uh I got the book
[1:10:57] back in the back I can't remember the
[1:10:59] name of it but it was uh the unwelcome
[1:11:01] Christ
[1:11:03] I believe it was 1956 is where I'm
[1:11:05] reading from but just read that because
[1:11:06] brother Brown he's a greater Storyteller
[1:11:08] than I am he's the greatest Storyteller
[1:11:10] that ever lived he can make you think
[1:11:12] like you were sitting right there with
[1:11:13] him
[1:11:14] and he was telling the story he said
[1:11:15] Simon come up he was having a gathering
[1:11:17] and asked Jesus to come and he said if
[1:11:19] you invite Jesus he'll come
[1:11:22] he'll appear right but what you do with
[1:11:25] him
[1:11:26] when he gets there that's it that makes
[1:11:29] the difference amen so it's what you do
[1:11:32] because Simon could have invited invited
[1:11:35] him in Brother Richard and he could have
[1:11:37] invited him in and they would have put
[1:11:38] that oil on his face
[1:11:40] they would have put they would have put
[1:11:42] the uh they would have set him down and
[1:11:43] washed his dirty feet brother Brown goes
[1:11:46] through all that and talks about the the
[1:11:47] dung of the cows and the horses being on
[1:11:50] his feet and how that it was a soothing
[1:11:53] thing for them to take and wash your
[1:11:54] feet and put the oil you know the the
[1:11:57] the
[1:11:58] um olive oil all over you you know and
[1:12:00] get you to smell good and then invite
[1:12:02] you in with a kiss and a hug and you
[1:12:04] were welcome he said then he said man if
[1:12:06] you did that to me in so many words he
[1:12:07] said if you did that to me and sister
[1:12:08] Trudy said make yourself at home she
[1:12:11] better not mean it if she I mean she
[1:12:13] better not say it she doesn't mean it
[1:12:14] all right
[1:12:15] because I'm gonna go kick my shoes off
[1:12:17] and I'm gonna go sit on her chair and I
[1:12:20] might put my feet on the coffee table
[1:12:24] if you tell me to make myself at home
[1:12:26] I'm going to the last one they said that
[1:12:28] you know that's what brother Brown was
[1:12:30] explaining said well Simon should have
[1:12:32] welcomed Jesus and said just make your
[1:12:33] sense at home
[1:12:35] but yet he didn't do any of that
[1:12:38] here's the key he wanted to see Jesus at
[1:12:41] his house
[1:12:44] appearance right
[1:12:47] a draw
[1:12:49] he thought he could get a bunch of
[1:12:50] people there to ridicule and to make fun
[1:12:52] of Jesus
[1:12:53] and there was Jesus with dirty feet
[1:12:55] remember said he'd come in through the
[1:12:56] back and one of the foot washed flunkies
[1:12:58] thought he was a foot wash funky and
[1:12:59] nobody watched Jesus's feet nobody done
[1:13:02] the things that they were supposed to do
[1:13:04] for him you know and take the dirt off
[1:13:05] of his neck but here was a woman
[1:13:09] and thank God
[1:13:12] that woman had many problems that woman
[1:13:15] had many husbands
[1:13:16] she had many denominational ideas
[1:13:19] but when she saw Jesus saying now the
[1:13:22] appearing to her was different than the
[1:13:24] appearing to Simon and it was in the
[1:13:26] same setting in the same house right
[1:13:28] wasn't anything different
[1:13:30] it was apparent to the eye
[1:13:33] so what did she do
[1:13:35] she saw a man she said brother Brown
[1:13:37] said she she thought back in her mind
[1:13:39] back
[1:13:41] two weeks ago three weeks ago a month
[1:13:43] ago she said I was going through
[1:13:44] Jerusalem
[1:13:46] and said he was there and Healing The
[1:13:48] Sick raising the Dead
[1:13:50] blind eyes could see and said he was so
[1:13:54] compassionate and said come unto me all
[1:13:55] ye that labored heavy ladies and she
[1:13:57] said oh I couldn't come to him said I
[1:13:58] was way back in the crowd said I was
[1:14:00] scared to come to him said but something
[1:14:02] now has drawn me to him Glory
[1:14:05] the Deep call to the Deep
[1:14:08] there was something in that woman
[1:14:11] she didn't see the appearing like the
[1:14:13] Pharisees saw the appearing same way
[1:14:16] with the world today people you can sit
[1:14:18] right here today
[1:14:19] and God can appear to you and you can
[1:14:21] say Amen to everything I say
[1:14:24] but unless his second coming is here
[1:14:29] you'll be just like those Pharisees
[1:14:32] it'll be Jesus with dirty feet all over
[1:14:34] again
[1:14:35] but she goes and she does
[1:14:39] something real strange
[1:14:43] she's used to the trade that she's in
[1:14:45] she's used to the men giving her gifts
[1:14:49] she was a prostitute right she was used
[1:14:52] to the men giving her gifts right
[1:14:54] right she was used to taking money from
[1:14:56] the men
[1:14:57] them you know giving over to her and and
[1:14:59] the draw was from the man to her
[1:15:04] but this man never drew like any other
[1:15:06] man Drew before
[1:15:09] the whole situation was turned around
[1:15:13] she goes and gets her money
[1:15:15] and she says oh I know he'll know
[1:15:19] where I got this money from
[1:15:21] see people that your life to God doesn't
[1:15:24] matter
[1:15:26] if you'll do like she did right
[1:15:29] take everything he said she took
[1:15:31] everything she had
[1:15:33] and she went to that man and she bought
[1:15:36] that alabaster box of ointment
[1:15:38] she didn't just keep it and go put it
[1:15:40] back up and use it during a good time
[1:15:42] right
[1:15:43] said she took it to Jesus right and got
[1:15:46] down on her hands and knees and washed
[1:15:49] the feet of the creator
[1:15:52] and Simon was standing right there
[1:15:54] beside of her and he missed the whole
[1:15:57] thing
[1:15:59] but see that was the bride
[1:16:01] coming to the bridegroom right because
[1:16:04] he looked at her and he said all your
[1:16:05] sins which me
[1:16:08] have now been forgiven
[1:16:10] that's all of us people that's all of us
[1:16:13] right she got the coming right
[1:16:16] Pharisees got the appearing
[1:16:19] and they're gonna have to appear one
[1:16:20] more time in front of it right
[1:16:22] you and I that's why I say our the
[1:16:25] appearing and the coming to you and I
[1:16:26] are going to have to come together all
[1:16:27] right because we don't go to a white
[1:16:30] Throne judgment and have to appear
[1:16:31] before God again right
[1:16:33] but everybody that missed his coming
[1:16:35] they just saw us appearing are going to
[1:16:38] have to appear before him one more time
[1:16:41] and they're gonna have to give an
[1:16:42] account
[1:16:43] of what they did when they saw him the
[1:16:45] first time
[1:16:46] but you and I that are born again
[1:16:48] that overlaps
[1:16:50] because he's got to reveal
[1:16:52] before he makes Manchester manifest
[1:16:53] right does it reveals it makes it
[1:16:56] manifest all right now carry on just for
[1:16:59] a few minutes
[1:17:01] but here we see
[1:17:03] her washing his feet her giving
[1:17:06] everything she had
[1:17:08] she was submitting herself
[1:17:10] right she was doing something totally
[1:17:13] out of character and that's the same way
[1:17:14] with you and I Our Lives we do something
[1:17:16] totally out of character
[1:17:18] when God comes to us and calls us
[1:17:21] her washing showed
[1:17:24] that there was more than just the
[1:17:25] appearing of a man right sitting on a
[1:17:28] bench
[1:17:30] because there was none of those
[1:17:31] Pharisees even though if she would have
[1:17:34] went up and confessed her sins to those
[1:17:35] Pharisees neither one of them could have
[1:17:37] looked at her brother Colin said your
[1:17:40] sins which are many are now forgiven
[1:17:44] right so she met the very one that she
[1:17:47] needed to me
[1:17:48] and then he had come in a type he had
[1:17:51] come to get her
[1:17:53] don't you think Jesus knew why he was in
[1:17:56] that spot
[1:17:57] he come to get that bride that woman he
[1:18:00] come to get her
[1:18:02] he knew Simon would would turn him down
[1:18:04] but he went and sat down in that seat
[1:18:07] knowing
[1:18:08] that she was coming
[1:18:10] same way you know we looked at the the
[1:18:12] armor Meat Packing Story
[1:18:14] now that young nice looking guy from
[1:18:18] Chicago he didn't just appear to the
[1:18:21] watch Girl
[1:18:23] he appeared to the three sisters right
[1:18:29] then he revealed himself to the wash
[1:18:31] woman
[1:18:32] and there was something about her
[1:18:35] that he liked
[1:18:37] right
[1:18:38] the other three thought well he surely
[1:18:40] he's going to come and get me
[1:18:42] but the only reason that that man came
[1:18:45] back
[1:18:46] was to get her Gloria
[1:18:49] she got to coming
[1:18:51] the other three sisters got the
[1:18:53] appearance right in the same house
[1:18:55] let's don't let that happen to us people
[1:18:57] let's do not let that happen to us
[1:19:03] but listen to this here's a little
[1:19:04] something to remember
[1:19:07] your attitude toward his appearing
[1:19:11] brings his coming amen
[1:19:14] your attitude toward his appearing
[1:19:17] brings his coming
[1:19:20] because you got to bring him on the same
[1:19:21] he's got to come here right for us to go
[1:19:24] there right right
[1:19:25] that's what's happened
[1:19:28] he appears just like after the
[1:19:31] resurrection he appeared to 500 Bible
[1:19:33] says he appeared to over 500 brethren
[1:19:36] now why didn't those 500 go to the upper
[1:19:39] room
[1:19:41] I'm gonna tell you something
[1:19:43] sister Trudy if you were dead
[1:19:47] and I knew you were dead
[1:19:49] and three days later you come and peered
[1:19:51] back
[1:19:52] I'd go to your house he couldn't get me
[1:19:55] out right
[1:19:57] but the Bible said he appeared to over
[1:20:00] 500 people brethren so I went Sinners
[1:20:03] right Brethren right right they got his
[1:20:06] appearing
[1:20:08] Believers that's what he said 500
[1:20:10] Believers Brethren people that believe
[1:20:12] right
[1:20:14] but they got caught up in the appearing
[1:20:16] amen and they didn't go to the upper
[1:20:18] room and get his contact amen okay
[1:20:22] that's the way you and I people that
[1:20:24] same way people from a mess those two
[1:20:26] brothers that's right walking down that
[1:20:28] road right they said the Bible said he
[1:20:30] appeared in a different form right well
[1:20:32] the only different form he could be was
[1:20:34] he was younger than they knew him yeah
[1:20:37] exactly he was just younger that's right
[1:20:41] he died looking like this yeah but he
[1:20:45] rose and there's not a picture of him of
[1:20:46] what he looks like when he rose because
[1:20:48] he's just a young kid young boy
[1:20:50] but that's what happened the the two
[1:20:52] from a mass but what happened they got
[1:20:55] to a place and they walked in and they
[1:20:57] sat down with him
[1:21:01] he appeared to him
[1:21:03] but when he got down there he done
[1:21:06] something
[1:21:07] that he had done in his first coming
[1:21:10] I believe he broke the bread and another
[1:21:12] piece popped back on it
[1:21:15] and they said there's God again the
[1:21:17] Creator and he vanished
[1:21:20] her lips don't miss
[1:21:22] the coming of the Lord
[1:21:24] now
[1:21:27] first Peter 1. let's read and then we'll
[1:21:29] finish up here and and I may just stop
[1:21:32] it
[1:21:34] and pick it up a little bit later
[1:21:38] sometimes you know you try to come to
[1:21:39] everybody wants to come to a climax or
[1:21:43] what they call in the Opera Crescendo or
[1:21:45] the you know the high note but sometimes
[1:21:47] you can't but sometimes I just want you
[1:21:50] to chew over this and then we'll talk
[1:21:51] about a little bit later that's just the
[1:21:53] way I am I don't you know and
[1:21:54] evangelists are good at that they're
[1:21:56] real good at bringing you you know like
[1:21:57] brother Jewell said you up and out down
[1:22:00] you know but I I'm just not built that
[1:22:03] way
[1:22:06] First Peter 1 verse 7.
[1:22:13] that's the trial of your faith being
[1:22:15] much more precious than a goal that
[1:22:16] perishes
[1:22:18] they'll be trying with fire now this is
[1:22:19] this is the 120. this is this is uh
[1:22:23] after after Calvary after the 120 after
[1:22:26] the upper room this is the in Us Part
[1:22:28] remember above us with us and now we're
[1:22:31] going to talk a few minutes about in us
[1:22:33] all right First Peter 1 verse 7 that the
[1:22:35] trial of your faith being much more
[1:22:36] precious than a goal that perisheth
[1:22:38] though it be tried with fire might be
[1:22:40] found unto praise and honor and Glory at
[1:22:42] the appearing
[1:22:44] and even the even the uh Schofield if
[1:22:47] you had a Schofield Bible it says
[1:22:48] Revelation that word appearing is
[1:22:50] translated into the word revealing our
[1:22:54] revelation
[1:22:55] at the revealing of Jesus Christ
[1:22:57] everybody see that's why that's why I
[1:23:00] said you have to watch these things
[1:23:01] they're deceiving Satan can slip in and
[1:23:04] he can he can show the world that oh
[1:23:06] when Jesus appears
[1:23:09] we're going and Jesus appears in the
[1:23:11] cloud brother Brown said you missed it
[1:23:15] come on people
[1:23:17] the Bible says he'll appear in the
[1:23:19] clouds the Eastern Sky how many people
[1:23:20] have you heard tell you that especially
[1:23:22] denominational people I'll be glad when
[1:23:24] that Eastern Sky parks and he walks down
[1:23:27] through there and I'm gonna go
[1:23:30] Amazing Grace how sweet to sound the
[1:23:33] same grits like me because I want to
[1:23:35] tell them yes
[1:23:37] that's not the coming you want to say
[1:23:39] that's right amen that's not the one you
[1:23:41] want to be in because this one is a
[1:23:44] secret coming at the appearing but what
[1:23:47] the sadness is people read that right
[1:23:49] there and they read a bunch of these
[1:23:51] verses that I have in scripture they
[1:23:53] might have and they're like oh man when
[1:23:54] Jesus appears well see they miss it they
[1:23:57] missed that appearing here so they're
[1:23:59] going to miss this coming like I said if
[1:24:01] you disappearing right you're going to
[1:24:04] see us coming
[1:24:05] all right now
[1:24:08] who was it
[1:24:09] whom having not seen
[1:24:13] you love
[1:24:15] and whom though now you see him not yet
[1:24:18] believing you rejoice with joy
[1:24:21] unspeakable and full of Glory receiving
[1:24:24] the end of your faith even the salvation
[1:24:26] of your soul now what is Peter telling
[1:24:30] us Peter is saying he's gone from us in
[1:24:33] a visible form where I walked with him
[1:24:36] on the shores of Galilee because if he's
[1:24:39] not saying that then let's go to John
[1:24:42] 14. John 14 then either John 14 is wrong
[1:24:46] or Peter is wrong if that's the way we
[1:24:48] take it yeah
[1:24:50] because Peter just said you don't you
[1:24:52] know you're not don't see him anymore
[1:24:55] but what Saint John 14 say
[1:24:58] which is the believer's promised land
[1:25:00] right
[1:25:02] John 14 16 says and I will pray the
[1:25:05] father and he shall give you another
[1:25:07] comforter that he may abide with you
[1:25:08] forever even the spirit of Truth whom
[1:25:11] the world cannot receive because it
[1:25:14] seeth
[1:25:15] and that's ongoing seeth him not
[1:25:18] they're not going to see him
[1:25:20] neither knoweth him but ye know him for
[1:25:23] he dwelleth with you and shall be in you
[1:25:25] I will not leave you comfortless I will
[1:25:28] come to you yet a little while and the
[1:25:31] world see if me no more right visible
[1:25:36] visible
[1:25:38] they're not going to visibly see that
[1:25:41] Jesus that walked the shores of Galilee
[1:25:45] that's what Peter was talking about but
[1:25:48] Peter goes on and says I have a more
[1:25:50] sure word of Prophecy because now he's
[1:25:51] inside of me the one that talked to me
[1:25:54] is now in me that's what he's Jesus is
[1:25:55] saying here r one of the two is wrong
[1:25:58] because watch he had a little while in
[1:26:00] the world says me no more but ye see me
[1:26:05] I will appear to you
[1:26:10] Vision sight words whatever but I'm
[1:26:14] going to appear to you
[1:26:17] because why
[1:26:19] because I live you shall live also at
[1:26:21] that day the prophet said this day ye
[1:26:23] shall know that I am in my father
[1:26:27] I wish I had three cuts
[1:26:34] I am in my father
[1:26:39] he and me
[1:26:41] can't get that down in there and I and
[1:26:44] you
[1:26:47] ask how you're gonna see me right
[1:26:49] you're not going to see me separated
[1:26:52] until we get
[1:26:54] home amen
[1:26:57] now
[1:26:59] he was hidden
[1:27:00] Church ages buy this right here
[1:27:03] but ye see me
[1:27:06] now how many of us have literally seen
[1:27:08] that man and that ain't gonna be that
[1:27:10] man that's gonna be a younger man if you
[1:27:12] literally see that person you're not
[1:27:15] going to because you're his body right
[1:27:18] if he comes to this Earth with his body
[1:27:21] he breaks the word you and I are his
[1:27:24] body right he would have two bodies come
[1:27:27] on
[1:27:29] but when we come back with him we'll
[1:27:32] have a body like his glorious body we'll
[1:27:34] all be just like this right here right
[1:27:36] but yet you're going to see this
[1:27:38] right
[1:27:39] blessing
[1:27:44] it's a revelation
[1:27:49] let's turn the second Thessalonians
[1:27:52] mm-hmm
[1:28:02] two
[1:28:07] I'm sorry
[1:28:09] first Thessalonians
[1:28:12] let's read it first let's start with
[1:28:14] that
[1:28:20] I'll tell you what go to Second
[1:28:22] Thessalonians we got a minute
[1:28:25] let's read that we got time to read it
[1:28:28] because down through the church ages
[1:28:30] what happened there was a lot of loose
[1:28:31] ends the prophet said and God was hidden
[1:28:34] inside of his people
[1:28:36] but yet Satan was right there as Dad
[1:28:39] said this morning he was right there
[1:28:40] with him
[1:28:43] weaving his own weaving a web of
[1:28:45] deception
[1:28:47] to where that you couldn't tell God from
[1:28:49] the Devil
[1:28:51] right because they just he deceived them
[1:28:54] right right
[1:28:56] but now look in Thessalonians for the
[1:28:58] ministry of iniquity that's already work
[1:29:01] only he who now letteth
[1:29:03] will let until he be taken out of the
[1:29:06] way
[1:29:07] and then shall that Wicked be revealed
[1:29:11] whom the Lord shall consume with the
[1:29:13] spirit of his mouth
[1:29:15] what the word and shall destroy with the
[1:29:18] brightness
[1:29:19] of his coming right even him who's
[1:29:22] coming now this is the devil's coming
[1:29:25] even him who's coming is after the
[1:29:27] workings of Satan with all power and
[1:29:30] signs and lying wonders and with all
[1:29:31] deceivable deceivableness of
[1:29:33] unrighteousness in them that perish
[1:29:36] because they receive not the love of the
[1:29:40] truth
[1:29:41] that they might be saved and for this
[1:29:44] cause God shall send them strong
[1:29:45] delusion that they should believe
[1:29:48] a lie right them who's them the church
[1:29:51] body
[1:29:52] the church out there not the bride the
[1:29:54] church
[1:29:56] right
[1:29:57] now let's go to first Thessalonians
[1:29:59] because he comes down
[1:30:05] and everybody people from the from from
[1:30:07] the time Jesus left everybody's been
[1:30:10] looking for it
[1:30:13] they look for him in here in this
[1:30:15] they look for him in this and then they
[1:30:18] read the Bible just like I told you
[1:30:20] it says oh when he appears in them
[1:30:22] clouds
[1:30:23] we'll see him that's what the Bible says
[1:30:27] but if you get that appearing wrong
[1:30:30] you're going to get the coming wrong
[1:30:31] right
[1:30:32] because the devil wants you to believe
[1:30:34] that that's just coming
[1:30:36] oh did he get you off just one word
[1:30:38] remember
[1:30:39] amen he can be just as truthful as he
[1:30:41] can be
[1:30:43] but twist it one word right
[1:30:45] oh yeah let's look for his appearing
[1:30:49] like in the denominations that you know
[1:30:51] even in some of the Baptists they they
[1:30:53] show that uh and I think everybody seen
[1:30:56] the movie left behind
[1:31:00] then the movie left behind
[1:31:02] at the beginning of the movie the Raptor
[1:31:05] takes place
[1:31:06] and then there's a group of people on in
[1:31:08] the movie that get saved yeah and then
[1:31:11] the Antichrist showed up
[1:31:13] right
[1:31:15] and I told somebody I said oh man said
[1:31:17] you see that Antichrist show up in the
[1:31:18] end of the movie I said no I saw him in
[1:31:20] the first of the Moon
[1:31:24] amen
[1:31:25] because if he can get you deceived to
[1:31:28] where you say well if I don't make the
[1:31:30] rapture
[1:31:31] I can get saved in the tribulation too
[1:31:33] now that's what they think
[1:31:36] that's right so he's got him
[1:31:38] he's got him yeah
[1:31:41] he's got him whooped
[1:31:43] they see another appearing they don't
[1:31:46] see the appearing in the coming together
[1:31:47] right right
[1:31:50] to us
[1:31:52] but right here
[1:31:54] we had a prophet read this scripture
[1:31:57] I just baptized my time
[1:32:01] or sprinkled it verse 13 but I would not
[1:32:04] have you to be ignorant Brethren
[1:32:05] concerning them which are asleep that
[1:32:07] you saw not even as others which have no
[1:32:10] hope for if we believe that Jesus died
[1:32:12] and rose again
[1:32:14] even so them also went sleeping Jesus
[1:32:16] will God bring with him for this we say
[1:32:19] unto you by the word of the Lord
[1:32:22] so where did Paul get it from
[1:32:24] from the word of the Lord amen that we
[1:32:28] which are alive and remain unto the
[1:32:30] coming
[1:32:33] and coming of the Lord
[1:32:35] shall not prevent or hinder them which
[1:32:38] are asleep glory for the Lord himself
[1:32:41] the day I know I'm getting in your
[1:32:42] sermon a few weeks from now but I'm
[1:32:44] sorry for the Lord himself
[1:32:47] shall descend right right from heaven
[1:32:51] now all these years the denominations
[1:32:54] have said we're going somewhere to get
[1:32:56] God
[1:32:57] we're going to heaven
[1:32:59] we're going here we're going to see him
[1:33:02] in the clouds
[1:33:04] right three which one of the three
[1:33:09] amen but to me if you get a revelation
[1:33:12] his appearing shows where he is amen if
[1:33:15] you get a revelation
[1:33:16] his appearing will show exactly where he
[1:33:19] is and is and he'll he'll show you where
[1:33:21] you are
[1:33:22] now
[1:33:23] listen to this this is something I
[1:33:25] picked up right here listen to this for
[1:33:27] the Lord himself shall descend from
[1:33:29] heaven with a shout voice of the
[1:33:30] Archangel Trump of God and the dead
[1:33:32] Christ shall rise first and that's going
[1:33:34] to happen well we under
[1:33:36] yeah
[1:33:37] it's all going to happen at one time
[1:33:39] that's when the Eastern sky is going to
[1:33:40] break and that's when we're going to see
[1:33:42] the appearing of Jesus Christ
[1:33:44] that's what the devil wants you to
[1:33:45] believe
[1:33:47] the people this has already happened
[1:33:48] right
[1:33:51] this is already been fulfilled right
[1:33:52] here
[1:33:54] man it's not coming
[1:33:56] right it's here amen
[1:33:58] he's coming is here all right
[1:34:01] because when
[1:34:03] you know if you shouted
[1:34:05] and nobody heard it
[1:34:09] wouldn't do any good
[1:34:11] right
[1:34:14] and if someone vote with a voice
[1:34:17] and nobody heard it
[1:34:19] it wouldn't do any good right
[1:34:22] and somebody blew a trumpet
[1:34:26] ain't nobody heard it
[1:34:27] wouldn't do you any good right right
[1:34:33] so here's my whole point
[1:34:37] somebody must have been here to hear the
[1:34:40] shout
[1:34:42] Glory somebody must have been here
[1:34:46] to hear the voice
[1:34:48] somebody must have been here to hear the
[1:34:51] trumpet
[1:34:53] because it's not see that's the
[1:34:55] revelation of this whole scripture
[1:34:57] because you got to have somebody here
[1:35:00] to hear these things
[1:35:02] not in heaven right here right because
[1:35:05] that's where brother Brown said Jesus
[1:35:07] does all three of these as at his
[1:35:09] descending descending where
[1:35:12] right in the woods
[1:35:15] to a building
[1:35:16] to a car
[1:35:18] to the Moon where there's nobody
[1:35:24] and me and you amen
[1:35:27] you had to hear it
[1:35:29] and let it become a part of you amen the
[1:35:32] appearing
[1:35:34] God appeared to you one day
[1:35:36] in a form of a little prophet
[1:35:41] and he spoke
[1:35:43] and you heard it
[1:35:45] and you received it
[1:35:47] now a lot of people miss it because they
[1:35:51] look at brother Brown being the
[1:35:53] appearing right
[1:35:55] right that's the truth
[1:35:56] but a true Prophet I love brother Jess
[1:35:58] at his uh in Oklahoma where he said at
[1:36:01] his desk he's got a picture right here
[1:36:03] what he done was he took the the picture
[1:36:06] of brother Brown I'm indicting that you
[1:36:08] know you know when he says I ain't diet
[1:36:09] this generation he's pointing like this
[1:36:12] brother Jeff's took that picture and put
[1:36:15] that picture of him pointing but then
[1:36:17] he's got the the cloud
[1:36:19] and he said a true prophet
[1:36:21] of Christ I'm in and he's got the profit
[1:36:25] pointing not the Jesus Christ and that's
[1:36:27] a wonderful out every time I sit there I
[1:36:29] almost cry but then we which are alive
[1:36:33] and remain she'll be caught up together
[1:36:34] with them in the clouds to meet the Lord
[1:36:36] in the air and so she only ever be with
[1:36:38] the Lord
[1:36:39] wherefore this word right here got to me
[1:36:42] the other day so I looked it up
[1:36:44] wherefore Comfort one another
[1:36:47] with these words
[1:36:49] Now look up the word comfort
[1:36:51] in the Greek
[1:36:53] and it translates
[1:36:55] to
[1:36:58] allowed
[1:36:59] call
[1:37:02] allowed call amen we think well for
[1:37:06] Comfort Comfort to us is Comfort Pro
[1:37:09] sister truly she's getting so old
[1:37:15] you just set up front Okay
[1:37:18] no the translation of that word Comfort
[1:37:22] is
[1:37:24] to call aloud
[1:37:27] so wherefore call aloud to one another
[1:37:31] with these words
[1:37:33] you gotta confess it before you can
[1:37:36] possess it let's stay
[1:37:38] he's now appear Ed parasito
[1:37:40] are they so much
[1:37:46] people
[1:37:49] amen you and I are his last appearing on
[1:37:53] this Earth that's why I said the
[1:37:55] appearing reveals the coming
[1:37:57] the appearing of you on Earth to get
[1:38:00] born again see this message and let God
[1:38:03] take you up through that statue of
[1:38:04] perfect man that is the coming of the
[1:38:07] Lord the way he wanted it amen amen he
[1:38:11] didn't want it in the prophets he didn't
[1:38:13] want it and the people in the Old
[1:38:15] Testament
[1:38:16] he wanted it in you
[1:38:20] and I
[1:38:24] he didn't want it just in a trumpet he
[1:38:26] wanted somebody to hear that trumpet
[1:38:28] he wanted somebody to hear that voice
[1:38:30] brother Danny he wanted somebody to see
[1:38:33] that shout to hear and then what do you
[1:38:36] want to do he wants you to shout it
[1:38:38] you know sometimes brother dick I know
[1:38:40] you look up words sometimes words is
[1:38:42] kind of and I looked at that word and I
[1:38:45] thought wherefore Comfort one another
[1:38:46] with these words
[1:38:49] and only in this day we can do that
[1:38:51] right
[1:38:52] but to call aloud to one another
[1:38:55] glory in other words don't keep it
[1:38:57] silent
[1:39:00] confess it
[1:39:01] and then possess it
[1:39:05] appearing
[1:39:06] Reveals His coming Glory
[1:39:09] I see God
[1:39:11] and this is this coming this is the
[1:39:14] coming of Lord Brothers again
[1:39:15] it's not nowhere else I'm not I'm not
[1:39:18] saying geographically to people on the
[1:39:20] table wherever I'm not saying Lula is
[1:39:22] the only place I'm saying in this
[1:39:23] message reveal amen this message made
[1:39:27] known and lived and made Manifest this
[1:39:29] is the coming of the Lord
[1:39:31] this is the shout and the voice and the
[1:39:35] trumpet this is all three together
[1:39:41] and when you see it
[1:39:44] he can appear in all kinds of forms
[1:39:48] and if he appears in the form that's not
[1:39:50] right
[1:39:50] you'll see the Antichrist amen that's
[1:39:53] what we had to do in the end time right
[1:39:54] we had to identify that Antichrist
[1:39:58] see what his work was
[1:40:00] and see how he was deceiving the people
[1:40:02] with a trinity and the father-son Holy
[1:40:04] Ghost and all these other things he was
[1:40:07] deceiving the people
[1:40:09] Born Again people
[1:40:11] he was deceiving them to believe that
[1:40:13] lie right
[1:40:15] but in the end time
[1:40:17] a little Prophet caught the appearing of
[1:40:19] God
[1:40:21] brought it to you and I and showed that
[1:40:23] it was this coming amen the appearing
[1:40:25] and the coming in this day is the same
[1:40:31] he's going to come
[1:40:32] and he's going to take us out of here
[1:40:35] and you and I when he appears once
[1:40:38] you're born again
[1:40:40] I wish you could believe this once
[1:40:42] you're born again he can't appear
[1:40:44] anywhere else
[1:40:47] show me somewhere you can appear
[1:40:49] if he's not appearing in you
[1:40:51] thank you I mean from the birth from
[1:40:53] from the New Birth he's appearing and
[1:40:55] coming and that is it
[1:40:58] I mean if you and your wife were one
[1:41:02] are you and your husband or one
[1:41:04] there's no separating right
[1:41:07] you see me
[1:41:10] thank God you see the characteristics
[1:41:11] and my wife's a lot of times are not
[1:41:13] mine
[1:41:14] but in a perfect world where Jesus
[1:41:16] Christ is perfect he takes on our sins
[1:41:18] and he says you're perfect too
[1:41:20] we don't see the little fallacies and
[1:41:22] all things that go on when we're when we
[1:41:24] get uh when we get older and can't see
[1:41:26] good I'm here good
[1:41:27] yeah
[1:41:29] but you know what though that's that's
[1:41:31] that's the type
[1:41:32] of God and us
[1:41:34] he don't see if he saw our fallacies
[1:41:36] he'd have to kill us
[1:41:37] but he don't that's why the appearing in
[1:41:40] the coming has to be together
[1:41:41] in this end time the appearing in the
[1:41:43] coming has to be together the appearing
[1:41:45] reveals is coming right let's bow ahead

[1:48:00] called me and said that he was coming
[1:48:01] and that some of his church members may
[1:48:04] be coming with him because they're
[1:48:05] calling off service because it's a big
[1:48:07] work to to for that camp for 125 kids
[1:48:11] plus they'll probably be about 50 adults
[1:48:13] there counselors and you know people
[1:48:15] that bring the children and all and and
[1:48:17] US there'll be you know several of us
[1:48:19] will be there but um remember that keep
[1:48:22] us in your prayers
[1:48:23] um I got to stay on them downstairs just
[1:48:25] for a second a testimony week
[1:48:27] um
[1:48:29] um Thursday morning we uh one of the
[1:48:32] owners or a couple of the owners came in
[1:48:34] and said that we were going to have a
[1:48:37] meeting with one of our customers that
[1:48:40] we get some product from and they were
[1:48:43] in so many words they were telling us
[1:48:45] that they they were their perception was
[1:48:48] that the customer was coming to to get
[1:48:51] rid of The Safaris you know and we're
[1:48:53] not doing any more product for them
[1:48:54] anymore
[1:48:56] because they had went down we went from
[1:48:57] like
[1:48:59] 400 000 pounds of product down to 100
[1:49:01] 000 pounds of product but anyway that's
[1:49:02] neither here nor there but the story is
[1:49:04] that that's what we were preparing for
[1:49:08] but we had picked up another few
[1:49:10] accounts from another place that was
[1:49:12] going to up our volume about 500 000
[1:49:14] pounds a week and so we weren't worried
[1:49:17] about that seven loads leaving and that
[1:49:20] customer leaving
[1:49:21] because we were going to make it up
[1:49:22] double you know and so but
[1:49:27] you know I told the Lord Thursday before
[1:49:29] I went to sleep I said I just I don't
[1:49:31] like this roller coaster ride
[1:49:34] I just don't like this we are when
[1:49:40] we don't have none of this we're about
[1:49:42] to go bankrupt we're about to hire 300
[1:49:44] people you know
[1:49:46] and I said Lauren I said you know and I
[1:49:49] never said Lord just do anything I just
[1:49:51] said Lord I'm just tired of this and I
[1:49:53] went off to sleep well about three
[1:49:54] o'clock Thursday morning
[1:49:56] popped right up out of the bed
[1:49:58] and I got thinking about that
[1:50:00] and I just said Lord I said at 99 day I
[1:50:04] said it's in your hands and he said go
[1:50:06] to sleep
[1:50:08] that's all he said go to sleep so I went
[1:50:10] to sleep next morning when I walked in
[1:50:12] the door
[1:50:13] this guy walks in and I could look at
[1:50:15] his face
[1:50:16] and I knew that he wasn't here to fire
[1:50:18] us
[1:50:21] they were there to give us 15 more loads
[1:50:24] which is
[1:50:26] 600 000 pounds of product more
[1:50:34] 150 people to hire tomorrow all right
[1:50:38] it's not we got to work seven days a
[1:50:40] week probably 60 or 70 hours huh
[1:50:42] a week there or maybe longer but that's
[1:50:45] okay but just you know I just didn't
[1:50:47] like that up and down stuff you know and
[1:50:49] Terrence knows in the chicken business
[1:50:51] it's like that it's up and down up and
[1:50:52] down but I said Lord I don't wanna I
[1:50:55] don't feel that way
[1:50:56] and they just like this piece Came Upon
[1:50:59] me you know just go sleep and as soon as
[1:51:00] that man walked through the door I could
[1:51:01] see in his face then he wasn't there to
[1:51:03] fire us he was there to give us more and
[1:51:05] he sure did and we're opening the second
[1:51:06] plant back up so uh just pray for us
[1:51:09] because this is the worst week it could
[1:51:10] have ever happened in the whole year
[1:51:12] this week
[1:51:15] was the worst week for it to happen
[1:51:18] because I'm going to have to leave
[1:51:19] Thursday Friday Saturday and Sunday to
[1:51:20] go over to the youth camp and
[1:51:23] one of the owners said I couldn't go but
[1:51:26] I'm I'm not taking that I'm gonna
[1:51:28] believe that I can go because I I want
[1:51:30] to go
[1:51:32] um and I told one of the one of the guys
[1:51:34] I said look this is just like me
[1:51:35] preaching this is a Ministry for me I
[1:51:37] said and it is it's a Ministry I
[1:51:39] minister to the kids because I can't get
[1:51:40] up in front of the kids and minister to
[1:51:42] them but I can Minister what I know
[1:51:44] through you know feeding the kids and
[1:51:46] and you know talking to them and all
[1:51:48] that so just pray that that everything
[1:51:50] will go okay I mean you know God's in
[1:51:52] control but I want to read you this
[1:51:54] right here just for a second before we
[1:51:55] go and this is nothing to me but I want
[1:51:57] to try to do this maybe if Daddy will
[1:51:59] allow me
[1:52:00] see God bless you brother this is from
[1:52:02] um a sister in India said I'm keeping a
[1:52:05] watch on the side of spoken word I've
[1:52:07] enjoyed all the videos including 70
[1:52:08] weeks you know the 70 weeks that we did
[1:52:10] here future home versus a millennium
[1:52:12] which is what we're doing down in the
[1:52:14] same school class I had to re-watch the
[1:52:16] Justified to glorify to keep Pace with
[1:52:18] what you were riding on the board as it
[1:52:20] was not very visible but I couldn't make
[1:52:22] it out I saw Pastor Dale's video as well
[1:52:24] the student the studies and sermons are
[1:52:27] such a blessing this is one Ministry
[1:52:29] that I can rely on
[1:52:32] taught me a lot and made Christ very
[1:52:35] simple
[1:52:36] Amen to justify the glorified was first
[1:52:39] preached somewhere else and daddy asked
[1:52:41] me to do it here she wants to part of
[1:52:44] the sermon that I did before
[1:52:46] so what I may do is as I was telling
[1:52:48] brother
[1:52:49] um Joe that uh if y'all bear with me and
[1:52:53] we may do it again and video it with
[1:52:55] that instead of when we videoed it over
[1:52:57] here it had a glare and you couldn't see
[1:52:59] anything on the board and that's nothing
[1:53:01] you know to me and I just like I tell
[1:53:03] you many times before I always tell the
[1:53:05] Lord I said just Lord forget me just
[1:53:08] that one person just have one person in
[1:53:10] this building or on the Internet
[1:53:11] sometimes we forget about the internet
[1:53:13] but he'll just have one person yeah you
[1:53:16] know I I don't want to go you know be
[1:53:17] some
[1:53:19] um worldwide nobody I like being right
[1:53:21] here with you guys but something like
[1:53:24] that just keeps you it makes you makes
[1:53:25] you want to get up and go to work
[1:53:27] tomorrow you know sometimes but I think
[1:53:29] we may do it again if the Lord if the
[1:53:30] Lord is uh good to us and
[1:53:33] and the pastor will give us time maybe
[1:53:35] we'll do it again and we'll do it with
[1:53:36] that camera which gets her a lot better
[1:53:38] reception and that way some of you as
[1:53:41] sister Johnny give me a big old poster
[1:53:43] board and said would you draw that I
[1:53:45] said I couldn't draw it save my life now
[1:53:48] and then Joe said well why don't you
[1:53:50] just get up here and draw it and I'll
[1:53:51] kind of impose it over the sermon that
[1:53:54] you preached I said that ain't gonna
[1:53:56] work either so I may just do it over
[1:53:58] again and may if that's okay with you
[1:54:00] guys we'll go over it again and and uh
[1:54:02] and I I just want to help people I don't
[1:54:05] care a thing about any getting anything
