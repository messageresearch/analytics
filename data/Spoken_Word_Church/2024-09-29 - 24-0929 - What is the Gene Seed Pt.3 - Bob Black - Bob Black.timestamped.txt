[4:21] terrible um a lot of work to be done so
[4:26] this morning we're studying just
[4:27] continuing our study on what what is
[4:29] that gen seed and just kind of
[4:30] meditating on this um weighty subject
[4:32] let's go to the Lord in prayer Lord God
[4:34] we're so grateful to be able to gather
[4:36] around your word and come together with
[4:37] these precious Believers of this light
[4:39] precious faith and I pray God that
[4:42] you'll be with us today Lord encourage
[4:43] us Lord Jesus we're so coming with
[4:45] expectation of what we're you're going
[4:47] to bring to us today I pray God as
[4:49] you'll help us that you'll settle our
[4:51] minds and prepare our hearts Lord to
[4:53] receive the word be with us today we
[4:55] pray in your name
[4:57] amen so uh we've been meditating on
[5:00] Romans 9:13 it says as as it is written
[5:04] Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated
[5:07] which is taken from uh Paul's quoting
[5:10] from Malachi that says I I have loved
[5:12] you sayith the Lord yet ye say wherein
[5:14] hast thou loved us was not Esau Jacob's
[5:17] brother sayith the Lord yet I love Jacob
[5:19] and I hated Esau and laid his mountains
[5:22] and his Heritage waste for the dragons
[5:24] of the
[5:25] Wilderness and uh as we meditate on
[5:27] these things we're thinking about how
[5:29] that even before Jacob and Esau were
[5:31] born that God had them uh had Jacob in
[5:34] his eternal thoughts so much to the
[5:36] point that it was an attribute of God
[5:38] waiting to be expressed and if you lay
[5:41] that out in time the word that's when
[5:44] we're hearing the word is actually
[5:46] expressing the thought that God had
[5:48] before the foundation of the world so we
[5:49] know the seed is the word that's
[5:52] expressing the genetics of God as you
[5:55] hear the word you're actually expressing
[5:57] the genetics but so but even even let's
[6:00] as we're meditating on this let's let's
[6:01] get in our mind that even before you
[6:04] hear your first sermon even before you
[6:07] you hear the first thing about God but
[6:09] you are already in God's mind now that's
[6:12] that's the that's the maybe the the the
[6:14] kicker there is but even before you ever
[6:17] knew anything about God that that you
[6:20] were already in God's mind and so the
[6:23] god predestines based on his forn
[6:25] knowledge so he knew that when you heard
[6:27] it you would want it and so he he can
[6:29] begin to lay things out in place and
[6:31] like brother R would say breed this one
[6:33] to this one breed that one to that one
[6:35] and work things out so that even before
[6:38] you heard your first sermon that things
[6:40] are already working out because God
[6:43] knows that you would believe it and and
[6:45] and uh you can kind of see that it's
[6:48] it's honestly difficult to kind of Artic
[6:52] you that's why I keep stressing you've
[6:54] got to you got to sit under the old
[6:57] apple tree and meditate on these things
[6:59] because we can preach it and teach it
[7:01] and those kind of things but there's
[7:03] this aspect that uh we'll never be able
[7:05] to relay with words over the pulpit that
[7:08] you just got to God God has to speak to
[7:11] you and reveal these things to you and
[7:13] that will give you a real understanding
[7:15] that you can just hang on to something
[7:16] when you you've got to have a personal
[7:18] relationship with God it's got it's got
[7:21] to be God to reveal these things to you
[7:23] and brother R would like in the message
[7:24] communion he would say things that are
[7:26] that are really honestly hard to
[7:28] understand about how he would talk talk
[7:29] about how when he was a little child and
[7:32] I'm going to go to this next slide and
[7:34] let's just think about this when when he
[7:36] was a little child his mother and his
[7:38] father were you know alcoholics they
[7:40] were not they they were not he was not
[7:42] raised in a Christian home at all but
[7:45] and and they would have their parties
[7:46] that would last all night he you you
[7:48] think about how he would say that
[7:50] they're they're having their drunken
[7:52] parties way into the early hours in the
[7:54] morning and him not knowing anything
[7:56] about Christianity but he just couldn't
[7:58] stand it he' he'd go and he'd sit by the
[8:01] river and he' he'd look down at the
[8:03] flowers coming up out of the after the
[8:06] cold winter he'd look at the frost he'd
[8:07] looked down at the flowers coming up and
[8:09] he'd begin to think flower where where
[8:11] are you coming from like I I why was was
[8:16] after the cold Frost has has gone over
[8:18] the Earth and and we just had a ter hard
[8:21] cold winter and and where is this flower
[8:23] coming from and you think about these
[8:25] Stars reflecting from eternity into the
[8:28] river that he's sitting next to
[8:30] and and and he would frame it up like
[8:31] this there was another William brandom
[8:35] another now what does that mean I've got
[8:37] hear this picture it's not like another
[8:39] person standing over to the side but
[8:41] it's him in time that the person that
[8:44] you are in time as a sinner is just a
[8:47] temporal a temporary thing who you're
[8:50] really supposed to be is is is a
[8:52] reflection the expression of God's
[8:54] thought from eternity that's that that
[8:57] that little that little moment in time
[8:59] where you were a sinner is just a blink
[9:01] and and down here in time where it's
[9:03] it's not who you're really supposed to
[9:05] be you're really that little boy sitting
[9:07] there running away from his mom and
[9:09] daddy having their drunken parties all
[9:11] night where he'd say sometimes I'd go
[9:13] home and I'd lay on top of the roof just
[9:14] waiting for the sun to come up because
[9:16] he was trying to get away from all that
[9:18] stuff that wasn't really who he was
[9:21] supposed to be really who he was
[9:23] supposed to be was that evangelist that
[9:25] would go around the world seven times
[9:27] and preach the gospel that when he heard
[9:29] the word it Quicken what did it Quicken
[9:31] it quickened the thought about him that
[9:34] God had before the foundation of the
[9:36] world so now that's that's where we get
[9:38] we get kind of uh confused in our mind
[9:42] there's these two things that are
[9:43] happening one is the seed is the word
[9:46] that you hear but the other is that God
[9:50] thought about you before the foundation
[9:52] of the world and when you hear the word
[9:54] it's quickening that thought so we
[9:57] there's a balance there right down
[9:59] between those two things you and we'll
[10:01] we'll we that's where I'm going in this
[10:03] little lesson we there's a tendency for
[10:05] us to gravitate toward one or the other
[10:08] well and and and we'll look at that in
[10:10] just a moment but let's in in God's mind
[10:13] in his thought his thought it's already
[10:16] finished you think in his thought he
[10:19] already saw all the way down to the end
[10:22] and he knew that brother brandham was
[10:24] not just going to be a little a child of
[10:26] some some some little catholic or
[10:28] whatever you know know that uh didn't
[10:30] know anything just somebody sitting next
[10:33] to the river not not having any purpose
[10:35] in his life but he was going to be
[10:37] called to preach the gospel and he was
[10:39] going to express that thought that God
[10:41] had before the foundation of the world
[10:42] and it was already finished just like in
[10:45] Revelation where it says all that dwell
[10:46] upon the Earth shall worship Him whose
[10:48] names are not written in the Book of
[10:49] Life of the lamb slain before the found
[10:51] from the foundation of the world so he
[10:53] God already saw that Jesus would die for
[10:55] our sins he already saw that in him were
[10:58] attributes that were going to be
[11:00] expressed he already saw and it was
[11:01] already finished the whole plan was
[11:04] already
[11:06] finished now that's a that's a weighty
[11:08] thing to think that God already knew
[11:11] where you would end up where you'd go to
[11:14] church what you would be in life he
[11:17] already knew you know we're stressing
[11:19] and worrying about things and and uh
[11:23] landslides in Tennessee and and all he
[11:25] already knew it all and he already had
[11:27] it prepared he already had everything
[11:29] situated for you and he already had the
[11:32] word ready for you that knowing that as
[11:35] soon as you heard it you would want
[11:37] it so the view from eternity is that a
[11:39] Christian doesn't become God's child
[11:41] only at the moment of their rebirth but
[11:43] rather the new birth manifest in time
[11:45] what was always true it's it's always
[11:48] true that's why Paul would say Galati in
[11:50] Galatians 4:9 because ye are Sons God
[11:53] hath sent forth the spirit of his son
[11:55] into your hearts crying ABA
[11:57] father and John chapter 10 he said my
[12:00] sheep hear my voice and I know them and
[12:03] they follow me and I give unto them
[12:04] eternal life and they shall never perish
[12:06] neither shall any man pluck them out of
[12:08] my hand my Father which gave them me is
[12:11] greater than all and no man is able to
[12:13] pluck them out of my father's hand which
[12:15] is why Jesus could go around with
[12:17] knowledge and call each one all of his
[12:21] disciples by name having known them
[12:22] before the foundation of the world not
[12:24] going to to to Matthew the little tax
[12:26] collector by chance well I hope he's
[12:28] going to follow me I hope he's going to
[12:30] want me more than all that money he's
[12:31] getting by being a tax collector and
[12:33] working for the Roman Empire no he he
[12:36] knew that when he as soon as he
[12:38] presented him with the word he was going
[12:40] to want
[12:41] it and so you're brother Brown was
[12:44] saying the invisible Union of the bride
[12:45] of Christ he said before there even was
[12:47] a moon stars or a
[12:49] molecule you are already Sons and
[12:52] Daughters of God for you are only the
[12:55] physical manifestation of the attributes
[12:58] that was in God at the beginning and
[13:01] then Christ is revealed in his own word
[13:02] he said if we are Sons and Daughters of
[13:04] God then we are attributes of God then
[13:07] we got eternal life and God is the only
[13:10] eternal life there is then we were in
[13:13] him from the beginning and when Jesus
[13:16] became all that word then we were a part
[13:19] of him then there you are when that's in
[13:23] there there is no devil no powers no
[13:27] nothing can ever remove it
[13:29] that's the tie poost of the Soul now you
[13:32] begin to realize that that's that's the
[13:34] reason why sometimes at these at at camp
[13:36] meetings and and and youth meetings the
[13:39] these quotes are are are preached even
[13:42] though maybe the young people don't
[13:44] really fully understand all the
[13:45] technicalities and things there's
[13:47] there's a power and understanding that
[13:49] that that God thought about you before
[13:51] the foundation of the world and and when
[13:53] you really catch even begin not fully
[13:56] catch it but just even partly you it
[13:59] begins to open up to you it will bring
[14:01] Liberty in somebody's life to think that
[14:03] there's a plan there's a purpose in your
[14:05] life and that you're that your little
[14:07] sin journey and all the things that you
[14:08] go through you know it it it it it
[14:12] there's something beyond that like
[14:14] brother brandom sitting there next to
[14:16] the river there's there's more there's a
[14:18] greater purpose than just running away
[14:20] from uh you or you start thinking about
[14:23] you know when I was a kid I I didn't
[14:25] like going to the skate we go to the
[14:26] skating ring and and and they'd be
[14:28] playing that rock music and you're just
[14:30] like I I don't like it and and
[14:33] uh there there's but there's something
[14:36] more there's something working there's
[14:37] something working there and that because
[14:40] there's a greater purpose for your life
[14:42] than just that kind of
[14:45] stuff and this morning in church age
[14:47] brother R will say it's not the person
[14:49] that comes predestinated eternally from
[14:51] God it is the word or seed that is it
[14:53] way back there too far back for the
[14:55] human mind to grasp the Eternal god with
[14:58] eternal thought false thought and decree
[15:00] Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated
[15:03] in other words it's not it's we're
[15:06] nothing without the word when he he sent
[15:08] his word so that it would catch us up
[15:10] into the plan and purpose of our life
[15:13] and you're not going to be there's no
[15:14] purpose in your life if you not if you
[15:16] don't hear the word and respond to it so
[15:18] it's not that that sinful perp person
[15:20] that's predestinated but it's the word
[15:23] that is predestinated eternally so when
[15:26] you hear the word and you respond to it
[15:27] you're caught up into the plan and
[15:29] purpose of God that he thought of before
[15:31] the foundation of the world but he knew
[15:33] he always knew that you would want it so
[15:36] he knew you were going to respond to it
[15:38] so he he was able to predestinate that
[15:40] way he said see it was the thought now
[15:44] that's really the key of the whole thing
[15:46] it was the thought and then that thought
[15:49] became expressed and God bought back
[15:52] Jacob because Jacob alone was seed Jacob
[15:55] alone had the seed that is why he had
[15:58] respect to the birthright and Covenant
[16:00] of God if you are true seed you will
[16:02] hear that word the spirit will baptize
[16:05] you into the body of Christ filling you
[16:07] and empowering you and you will receive
[16:09] the word for your day and age see how
[16:12] clear the true evidence becomes when the
[16:14] word is revealed to you so God's Eternal
[16:17] purpose and decree predestines the word
[16:21] within specific individuals for certain
[16:24] plans not just a person in isolation the
[16:27] focus that is not on predes ining
[16:29] individuals arbitrarily but on predestin
[16:32] the word that they will ultimately
[16:35] receive and live by so that means that
[16:39] the life that we're living right now is
[16:42] the thought that God had before the
[16:44] foundation of the world Amen and how how
[16:47] is the thought expressed well a word is
[16:50] a thought expressed so the word that
[16:53] we're preaching and the word that you
[16:54] hear when you play a tape just like we
[16:56] were listening to that tape a moment
[16:57] moment ago the thought expressed is the
[17:00] word so the word is expressing the
[17:03] thought so you're the thought now there
[17:06] we're where we're getting to is that
[17:08] that thought is expressed in Matthew 13
[17:11] we're getting to in a moment that you
[17:13] are part of God you're an attribute of
[17:15] God and that thought of God had to be
[17:18] expressed and on the other side of the
[17:20] equation is the word that you hear which
[17:21] is the seed the seed preached expresses
[17:24] the
[17:27] thought I need to slow down I know this
[17:29] is this is uh this is weighty the voice
[17:33] of the sign brother R said there was a
[17:35] little woman a prostitute up here was
[17:38] black as it could be she was Ill Fame
[17:41] but down in her heart she was
[17:43] predestinated to
[17:45] life and then when Jesus the word came
[17:48] on the scene those Pharisees said this
[17:49] man is be elub what did it do it
[17:51] blackened out what little light they
[17:53] had Jesus said you are of your father
[17:56] the devil and his works you do but when
[17:58] this little foul woman come and she seen
[18:00] the word of God she know it she didn't
[18:04] live it but she knowed it and as soon as
[18:05] it spoke to her she said I perceive your
[18:08] prophet and he she said I know the
[18:11] Messiah will do this and he said I am he
[18:13] what did it do it cleaned out the
[18:14] Blackness and made it all white why
[18:18] there was a seed laying there a
[18:19] predestinated seed that was he he he
[18:22] said he he clearly says what that
[18:24] predestinated seed is it was God's
[18:26] thought before the foundation of the
[18:28] world right if you really start
[18:30] meditating on it's it's almost like a
[18:32] circle that God knew God knew before the
[18:35] foundation of the world what your
[18:36] reaction would be so he could he you
[18:38] were part and an an eternal attribute in
[18:41] his thoughts and then now looking down
[18:44] you you can say where brother R frames
[18:45] it like with the reason she believed
[18:47] because she was a thought why was she a
[18:48] thought cuz he knew she would have want
[18:50] it he's looking at her reaction before
[18:53] the foundational World she's going to
[18:55] want it so he can predestinate her or
[18:57] why'd she want it cuz she's a thought
[18:58] and God's
[19:00] M that's just amazing to me doesn't that
[19:03] get y'all
[19:05] excited that I I love this that this
[19:08] this this is something this I'm telling
[19:10] you this is why it's preached in youth
[19:11] meetings and things because you see this
[19:14] and you start recognizing that you
[19:16] you're part of God before the foundation
[19:18] of the
[19:19] world oh it's it's it's rich now he said
[19:23] and knoweth it not he said I was in
[19:25] Christ you were in Christ before the
[19:27] foundation of the world he came to
[19:28] redeem his own his own that was in him
[19:30] his children that was in him he came the
[19:35] word came to express himself and preach
[19:38] the word so that the word would Express
[19:41] you now now here we got the two extremes
[19:44] let's meditate on this for a few minutes
[19:46] before we close here's the two extremes
[19:49] some people on the one side and I've set
[19:51] across the table from people that that
[19:52] believe this well I come to the world
[19:54] with eternal life already in me this is
[19:56] the left box I I came with eternal life
[20:00] and when I was born again was just like
[20:02] the veil was yanked off of me and I
[20:04] realized oh I already had it to begin
[20:06] with and like there was a speck of life
[20:09] that would put on a PowerPoint slide or
[20:11] something or or you know they want to
[20:12] look under a microscope and say well you
[20:14] already had eternal life in your soul
[20:16] when you come and when you were born
[20:18] again we're they're redefining what it
[20:20] means to be born again to say well you
[20:22] you already had it to begin with and
[20:23] when you were born again you just
[20:25] realized that you already had it there's
[20:28] a truth to that though there's a truth
[20:30] to that but but you can't make it that
[20:32] you already had the life of God like
[20:35] that there's a quote in the message
[20:36] identification that says when you were
[20:38] born in sin shapen in iniquity you come
[20:40] to the world speaking lies and there was
[20:42] nothing in there there was nothing but
[20:45] then you look at the quote in a thinking
[20:46] man's filter and he said down in there
[20:48] down in your soul was eternal life it
[20:50] was always in there hold on now you got
[20:53] to reconcile reconcile those two things
[20:56] so that's what we're trying to do
[20:57] there's there's nothing in there there
[20:59] but there's something there and what
[21:01] that something is it's a Concrete
[21:04] thought of the Living God that that is
[21:06] so concrete that those attributes could
[21:09] shout for Joy before the foundation of
[21:10] the world so it's something but it's
[21:13] nothing now that's why it's difficult to
[21:15] articulate it's something but it's
[21:17] nothing so you on the left hand side you
[21:19] go to the extreme well I come to the
[21:21] world already with eternal life well
[21:23] hold on
[21:24] now what are you talking about then on
[21:27] the other s side there there was nothing
[21:29] there there was nothing there until you
[21:31] heard your first sermon the seed is the
[21:33] word and so uh because the seed is the
[21:36] word I nothing nothing happened at all
[21:39] and there was no nothing going on before
[21:42] I heard my first sermon now hold on then
[21:45] then you wipe away all the
[21:47] predestination you're wiping away all
[21:49] the for knowledge you're wiping away
[21:51] that God could breathe this one to this
[21:53] one and this one to this one that that
[21:55] God was that you had an angel watching
[21:57] over you from your birth because God
[21:59] knew that you would be you would receive
[22:01] it you're wiping away all that because
[22:03] you're looking at it so dogmatically the
[22:05] other side so that's those two extreme
[22:09] there's a balance right there in the
[22:11] middle that is addressed by Matthew 13
[22:14] so if you look at Matthew 13 it's the
[22:17] parable of the two of the soers and and
[22:20] one when one Parable the parable is the
[22:23] seed is the word and the other Parable
[22:27] the seed is is the children of the
[22:29] Kingdom so in one Parable you've got the
[22:32] attributes of God waiting to be
[22:34] expressed and the other Parable you've
[22:37] got the word that is the seed that's
[22:39] going to express those attributes now
[22:42] these two parables are extremely
[22:44] important to understand this principle
[22:46] and you won't find you won't find these
[22:48] two parables in any other gospel Luke
[22:51] Mark any other all the other ones it's
[22:54] just the parable of the so went forth
[22:56] the soul and all the different the four
[22:59] the parable of the four soils the good
[23:01] ground the seed on the Wayside and so
[23:03] forth and where the good ground is where
[23:06] the seed Falls that's where it's going
[23:08] to come up but only Matthew Matthew 13
[23:11] is the parable where the seed is the
[23:13] children of the kingdom and so that puts
[23:16] these two extremes together that there's
[23:18] you are a thought you were a thought in
[23:21] God's mind before the foundation of the
[23:23] world and brother Brandon would Express
[23:25] that thought in his sermons as down in
[23:27] your soul there's like another you where
[23:30] where is it what what is it something
[23:32] that you could put under a
[23:34] microscope something some somebody
[23:36] that's like standing like another body
[23:38] or something no it but but that's that's
[23:41] the way that brother brandom expressed
[23:42] it is that there's something else what
[23:45] is it it's something that God knew that
[23:47] you would come to a Target in your life
[23:50] that he was that that that's why this
[23:53] message had to come to bring us to the
[23:56] place that God thought of us before the
[23:58] foundation of the world and see the
[24:01] thought is not just you being born again
[24:03] it's but you coming to an adopted son
[24:05] and and all those things that the word
[24:07] would be so fully expressed in the
[24:09] brides in in in this last day that you
[24:12] would be the living and B the full
[24:14] expression of the son of man revealed in
[24:17] this day would be the expression of the
[24:19] thought the attribute of
[24:22] God
[24:24] so he would say now now now we're going
[24:26] to get into some quotes now if you don't
[24:28] really understand these things then you
[24:30] hear somebody preach it over the pull
[24:32] pit and you'll shy back from it and
[24:34] you're like I think he's saying
[24:36] something that he's not so let's read
[24:39] some of these more difficult quotes The
[24:41] God Who is rich in Mercy he said many of
[24:42] you can fellowship with me on this
[24:44] thought when you was a little boy or a
[24:47] little girl you would walk around and
[24:49] there would be certain things that would
[24:51] just where it wouldn't bother the other
[24:53] kids now he's talking about before you
[24:56] ever heard anything about the gospel
[24:59] that's now this is what stumbles us here
[25:02] before you you didn't know nothing about
[25:04] the gospel like brother brandham sitting
[25:06] beside that River he didn't know nothing
[25:10] when you was a little boy or a little
[25:11] girl you would walk around and there
[25:12] would be certain things that would just
[25:13] where it wouldn't bother the other kids
[25:16] it seemed like there was something in
[25:18] you that cried
[25:19] out there was God somewhere yet you were
[25:22] a sinner you remember that now I I think
[25:26] it's wonderful we were fellowshipping
[25:28] the other other day with some of the
[25:29] some of y'all in here and you get around
[25:31] the the supper table or you start
[25:33] talking about these things and we all
[25:36] had this testimony you start testifying
[25:39] yes I experienced that and the other
[25:42] across the table I did and you go around
[25:44] and and these Believers that are born
[25:47] again I think it's amazing and
[25:49] astounding how you start getting around
[25:52] with Believers and they've all got this
[25:55] testimony and and I can't help it if
[25:57] somebody does
[25:58] all I know is I got this
[26:02] testimony it seemed like there was
[26:05] something in you that cried out there
[26:07] was God somewhere yet you were a sinner
[26:10] you remember that certainly now what was
[26:11] that that was that little form of life
[26:14] in you then now there hold on a second
[26:16] life in
[26:18] me what kind of
[26:22] life not not eternal life like already
[26:26] expressed but that's why brother preach
[26:28] that sermon the Deep calleth for the
[26:30] Deep it's it's like the story of the
[26:32] duck in the in the barnyard you know you
[26:35] want water but you don't know what water
[26:37] is and one day you sniff the water and
[26:41] you get a sense of the water that's what
[26:43] I've been wanting all my life there's
[26:45] the water you were the duck in the
[26:48] barnyard and then after a while you
[26:50] heard the gospel maybe you went to a
[26:52] church you picked out this and that and
[26:54] went from denomination to denomination
[26:56] but one day you be being part of God you
[26:59] had to be part of the word and when you
[27:01] heard the word you know where you come
[27:04] from like the duck the duck in the
[27:05] barnyard you know where you come from
[27:07] you know what was the truth you were
[27:10] always the seed was in you
[27:16] always start don't start choking now now
[27:19] you hadn't heard the word but yet there
[27:21] was a representation the th and youth it
[27:25] was like another William Brandon was
[27:27] waiting to come up there was another Bob
[27:29] black this wasn't the Bob black when I
[27:31] was a sinner it wasn't the Bob black
[27:33] That was supposed to be expressed uh it
[27:35] was but it was in me it was it was in me
[27:38] not in me that I could look like under a
[27:40] microscope or something or put as a
[27:42] little dot on a PowerPoint slide but it
[27:44] was in me something there waiting to be
[27:47] expressed laying there in the thought of
[27:49] God and it was going to be expressed by
[27:52] the word which is the seed because the
[27:54] seed expresses the word the word that
[27:58] was a thought of God before the
[28:00] foundation of the world the word seeing
[28:03] the word that was in you that was before
[28:05] the foundation of the world saw the word
[28:07] and you come to it now there's those two
[28:09] parables in Matthew 13 the word that you
[28:12] heard saw the word and expressed it
[28:16] that's right and now like that quote
[28:17] where brother R said God thought it he
[28:19] spoke it and now here you are now here
[28:22] you are Christian sitting on the Pew the
[28:25] expressed word for your day so hear in
[28:28] the word is the realization it expresses
[28:32] a spiritual truth that existed all along
[28:35] from God's Eternal
[28:37] perspective and God from from God's
[28:40] Eternal view looking over the banister
[28:42] of Heaven you always were Eternal you
[28:45] always were a Son of God you always were
[28:48] part of him but it had to be expressed
[28:50] here in
[28:51] time so even before now here's Here's
[28:53] the Clincher that we really want to get
[28:57] even before before someone consciously
[29:00] chooses to accept and follow God there's
[29:03] a Divine component already at work life
[29:06] though not realized at that time is
[29:09] waiting to be expressed s through
[29:12] receiving the word by faith and the
[29:14] message communion and I'll I'll stop
[29:17] right I guess the musicians can go ahead
[29:19] and come forward and we'll start winding
[29:20] down with this quote he said I used to
[29:22] remember as a little boy I hope I'm not
[29:24] holding you too long but no one's
[29:25] sitting out in the on the creek Bank and
[29:28] this is the quote that I Illustrated
[29:30] earlier with that picture of brother R
[29:33] sitting next to the creek I'd sit there
[29:35] and look around at night time pop and
[29:37] Mom they're gone on now to their rest
[29:39] and them days they were Sinners there
[29:40] was no Christianity in our homes at all
[29:42] no Christianity in our homes at
[29:47] all I keep stressing that point so we'll
[29:50] get some and all my drinking and parties
[29:54] and carrying on it made me sick I tell
[29:58] take my Lantern and my dog and go to the
[30:00] woods to stay all night in the winter
[30:02] time I'd hunt till the party was over
[30:04] maybe daylight in the morning come home
[30:05] wouldn't be over i' laid on top of a
[30:07] shed and sleep waiting for daylight to
[30:09] break then I think of how that times
[30:11] then being out there in the summertime
[30:13] get my sticks and put them down for a
[30:15] little Windbreak where if it rained lay
[30:17] there and have the poles sticking in the
[30:18] water fishing now think about him
[30:21] fishing trying to get away from all that
[30:23] partying that his family was doing all
[30:24] night long couldn't hardly get any peace
[30:26] of mind all that racket and everybody
[30:28] shouting and hollering and
[30:29] laughing and and he's he can't stand it
[30:33] my old dog laying there I'd say
[30:35] look at here you know last winter I
[30:36] camped right here one night I built a
[30:38] fire right here when I was waiting for
[30:40] my old dog here to tree and I had a fire
[30:42] here it was froze five inches deep in
[30:44] the ground but Little Flower where did
[30:47] you come from
[30:49] see well and where did you come from Who
[30:51] come out here and planted you and what
[30:54] hot house did they bring you out of but
[30:57] what about it where did you come from
[30:58] see that little flower I'd say why it
[31:00] was froze and everything and I built a
[31:02] fire on top here besides the freezing
[31:05] element there was a heat element laying
[31:06] here on a big old log where I burned you
[31:10] and yeah here you are and you're
[31:13] alive where did you come from that
[31:16] flower was the expression of something
[31:17] that looked like there wasn't nothing
[31:19] there he burned a fire on top of where
[31:21] that flower come from and now the same
[31:24] thing as you and I where did you come
[31:26] from well what was it there was another
[31:30] William brandom see a little spot of
[31:32] eternal life down there from the genes
[31:34] of God the word of God that was placed
[31:37] in there each one of you can think of
[31:40] similar things see it was
[31:43] working God bless you Saints
[31:47] [Applause]
