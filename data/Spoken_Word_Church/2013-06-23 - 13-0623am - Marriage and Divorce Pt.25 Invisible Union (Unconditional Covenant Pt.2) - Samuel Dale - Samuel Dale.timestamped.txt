[5:18] little surprise amen so we appreciate it
[5:21] amen
[5:21] amen you love the Lord
[5:23] let's turn in our scripture to Romans 7
[5:26] where we've been
[5:27] and then we will go to Exodus 19. Romans
[5:31] 7.
[5:33] in Exodus 19. I believe that all
[5:35] announcements we're supposed to make
[5:40] and to have Matthew and
[5:42] Brittany and baby Ace with us today too
[5:45] they're up with us glad to have them
[5:48] you know
[5:52] let's see there's something else that
[5:55] I'm trying to remember that uh
[5:58] brother came by the office a while ago
[5:59] and I said hey wait a minute I got to
[6:00] tell you something but I don't forgot
[6:01] what it is I'm 73. you know I remember
[6:05] it after a while okay Romans 7 and
[6:07] exodus 19. Lord Jesus we thank you
[6:10] Father for your grace and your love into
[6:12] it thank you for all the things that
[6:15] you've given unto us
[6:17] thank you for giving our brother and
[6:19] sister an opportunity to bring children
[6:23] forward because we know that they were
[6:24] told that they couldn't have them
[6:26] but yet we believe you and you've taken
[6:30] care of all things because you show
[6:32] yourself unto us and you make known the
[6:34] things that are impossible to man
[6:37] but all things are possible to you and
[6:40] then you turn right around and said all
[6:42] things are possible to them that believe
[6:44] so we thank you we Praise Your Great
[6:46] Name come now and speak to us as we read
[6:49] your word and then come and give us lord
[6:51] of the understanding forgive our sins
[6:54] and may your grace and love be with each
[6:56] one of us in Jesus name
[6:58] amen
[7:00] Romans 7 we've been on this for quite a
[7:03] while now
[7:04] and we're we're still speaking on
[7:08] marriage and divorce and you say well
[7:10] you've you're on this and you're on the
[7:12] law and you're on the things and
[7:15] yeah
[7:17] and that's why we're still on marriage
[7:19] and divorce
[7:20] because marriage and divorce tires ties
[7:22] into our Bible together
[7:24] from Genesis to Revelation is marriage
[7:26] and divorce
[7:28] to see what God has extended the grace
[7:31] unto us of all the things okay Romans 7
[7:35] know you're not brethren for I speak to
[7:37] them that know the law
[7:39] how does the law had dominion over a man
[7:41] as long as he lived remember over
[7:43] mankind as long as he lives
[7:45] he's under the law you said no the law
[7:47] ended at Calvary I got a quote from the
[7:49] prophet amen just keep on reading you'll
[7:52] find him
[7:53] saying some things to you because if
[7:57] Christ is the end of the law for
[7:59] righteousness to them that believe if
[8:01] we're not a Believer the law is still in
[8:02] existence
[8:04] that's where the problem is mankind
[8:06] wants to do away with things you'll see
[8:08] that as we keep going along in it that
[8:11] we you know wanting something to do we
[8:13] want to change it off or something and
[8:15] God
[8:17] has already got it set knows what it's
[8:19] going to be all right
[8:22] now watch he illustrates
[8:25] around said this is not necessarily he
[8:27] said well sure this is wrong marriage
[8:29] and divorce invisible Union he's
[8:30] speaking of it but he said really this
[8:32] is a prophecy of sitting in order of
[8:34] scriptures
[8:36] all right so what you're going to
[8:37] illustrate it for the woman which hasn't
[8:39] heard when it's bound by the law to her
[8:41] husband as long as he live it but if the
[8:43] husband be dead she is loose from the
[8:45] law of her husband so then if while her
[8:48] husband lives she'd be married to
[8:49] another man she shall be called an
[8:51] adulteress but if her husband be dead
[8:53] she is free from that law so that she
[8:56] has no adulteress though she be married
[8:58] to another man
[8:59] now watch wherefore my brethren ye also
[9:02] are become dead to the law how by the
[9:05] body of Christ so he's speaking of the
[9:07] body of Christ he's not speaking of just
[9:09] the woman part you know all right he's
[9:12] illustrating
[9:13] that you should be married to another
[9:15] even to him who is raised from the dead
[9:18] that we should bring forth fruit unto
[9:22] God for when we were in the flesh the
[9:24] Motions of sin which were by the law did
[9:26] work in our members to bring forth fruit
[9:29] unto death but now we are to now we are
[9:32] delivered from the law how because of
[9:35] the body of Jesus Christ because of
[9:37] being saved what that being dead we're
[9:39] in we were held
[9:41] that we should serve in newness of
[9:43] spirit and not in the oldness of the
[9:46] letter
[9:47] all right let's go back and we pick up
[9:50] from Exodus
[9:52] 19.
[9:54] we all well know what this party is it's
[9:57] a prophet told us that Israel made their
[9:59] fatal mistake here
[10:01] so let's go back and read it and just
[10:03] pick up a thought and try to continue on
[10:06] with what we're on so we're going to
[10:09] Exodus 19 verse 3.
[10:13] and Moses went up unto God and the Lord
[10:16] called unto him out of the mountain
[10:19] saying Thou shalt thou say to the house
[10:21] of Jacob and tell the children of Israel
[10:24] now listen he telling them who they are
[10:30] how great of people they are what All
[10:33] Things Are
[10:35] what you have seen what I did unto the
[10:39] Egyptians and I'll bear You On Eagle's
[10:41] Wings and brought you unto myself
[10:44] now therefore if you will obey my voice
[10:47] indeed and keep my Covenant
[10:50] and you shall be up to you remember
[10:52] that's an unconditional Covenant we'll
[10:53] get to that in a second
[10:55] all right
[10:57] you'll be a peculiar treasure unto me
[11:00] above all people
[11:02] for all the Earth is mine
[11:04] and you shall be unto me a kingdom of
[11:06] priests
[11:07] and holy nation these are the words
[11:10] which Thou shalt speak unto the children
[11:12] of Israel
[11:13] and Moses came and called for the Elders
[11:16] of the people and laid before their
[11:18] faces all these words which the Lord
[11:21] commanded him
[11:22] and all the people answered together and
[11:26] said all that the Lord has spoken we
[11:30] will do and Moses returned the words of
[11:32] the people unto the Lord you may be
[11:35] seated the Lord had his Blessing to the
[11:37] reading of the word
[11:39] now
[11:40] we've been in this for quite a while
[11:44] and trying to
[11:46] express some thoughts and ideas
[11:50] and uh
[11:53] but I want you to think about something
[11:58] I didn't finish up the message
[12:00] Wednesday night
[12:02] as you know I never do I generally get
[12:04] up to a point and have to stop because
[12:06] time runs out but
[12:10] we were talking Wednesday night about
[12:12] an unconditional Covenant
[12:16] now
[12:17] what is this an unconditional covenant
[12:20] mean to you
[12:25] well brother Dale it means
[12:27] that God gave me a covenant
[12:30] and it's unconditional
[12:34] okay
[12:37] now precede with that thought and
[12:39] express what you're saying
[12:42] unto me of what I asked the question
[12:48] well it means there's no
[12:51] regulations there's no rules there's no
[12:53] thoughts there's no nothing's
[12:56] well you know
[13:00] not going off on the Baptist but they
[13:02] had a Doctrine
[13:04] of call once saved always saved
[13:08] and in that Doctrine it was that if he
[13:10] was ever once born again
[13:12] you would always be born again well I'd
[13:14] agree with him if you know when I did
[13:16] back there and argued with him over some
[13:18] things even before I was
[13:20] you know if I heard of this message
[13:21] really
[13:24] because I never did accept that point
[13:27] because I'd always seen there where the
[13:30] scripture said he that believeth amen
[13:32] and that's what I asked the Baptist
[13:33] preacher one day about it and he
[13:35] couldn't answer it I said why does the
[13:37] Bible say believeth and you keep saying
[13:39] believe
[13:41] I mean you just say all I got to do is
[13:42] believe
[13:44] you know and I said how come it is it's
[13:47] talk to us
[13:48] like that when the Bible says believeth
[13:51] right and it's baptized shall be saved
[13:54] and he honestly admitted he said I don't
[13:57] understand of course he didn't change
[13:59] anything because that would have changed
[14:01] his status you know as a pastor but
[14:07] what do we think about an unconditional
[14:09] Covenant this is not the message this
[14:11] morning I hope may just be the message I
[14:13] may take this thought because it's there
[14:16] uh what do you think an unconditional
[14:19] Covenant is
[14:24] well he just gave it to Abraham
[14:27] and and he gave adam a covenant
[14:31] and Adam broke it you know we quote
[14:34] brother random coming down
[14:37] and said he seen that every time he made
[14:39] a covenant said he gave it on over and
[14:41] come through Noah and the things you
[14:43] know
[14:43] the Covenants
[14:46] and said always man would break the
[14:48] Covenant
[14:51] you know and do wrong
[14:53] that's true man
[14:55] so he comes to Abraham and he said
[14:57] Abraham I've already done it
[15:01] it's a finished product
[15:06] and right around called it an
[15:07] unconditional Covenant
[15:10] right
[15:11] he said Abraham that's not what you do
[15:13] or have done
[15:15] I've already done it
[15:18] now
[15:20] does that give us a license to go out
[15:24] and do wrong
[15:26] it was what I was trying to express
[15:27] Wednesday night
[15:30] does he give us a right to just
[15:33] well it don't matter what I do or what
[15:35] you know it's unconditional
[15:40] well
[15:41] I know I'm a strange old bird
[15:43] sorry I've been this way a long time and
[15:46] I imagine I'll stay this way
[15:49] and I have an odd way of expressing
[15:51] things but like sister Gail says brother
[15:53] they'll make you think
[15:55] well all right that's my purpose
[15:58] that's what I'm for
[16:00] to make you think we have two three
[16:02] three School teachers here I know
[16:05] and uh
[16:07] they want their children to think
[16:11] because in engaging their minds are
[16:14] getting a thought in together with it
[16:16] you know you can you can get to the mind
[16:18] of the children and be able to help them
[16:23] but what do you think about an
[16:25] unconditional Covenant
[16:30] there would be no way that it could make
[16:32] it that we could just go live like we
[16:34] want to live
[16:36] now the prophet said if you live like
[16:37] you want to live it proves you're lost
[16:40] so do we do we need those quotes do we
[16:42] need those thoughts or do you believe it
[16:44] like it truth of what it is
[16:47] the Bible says here if you live like the
[16:49] devil you are the devil perforations in
[16:51] the Lord's Prayer
[16:54] you can't serve God and man them you
[16:57] know the world
[16:59] all right but yeah we live in the world
[17:02] but we're not bound for the world
[17:05] all right that's where I try to
[17:08] maybe I shouldn't
[17:10] uh
[17:11] like that you know we're in the world
[17:16] we're we're on every line of what would
[17:19] be called the world ma'am you know the
[17:21] the things
[17:22] but the Bible says we're not of the
[17:24] world
[17:26] all right
[17:27] now without an understanding of that
[17:29] where we left
[17:32] but see that's what I try to do
[17:35] is get you to think things over
[17:38] you see this afternoon the Lord willing
[17:40] when we get down to it
[17:43] you'll see maybe why we've been around
[17:45] here about 40 years 40 something years
[17:47] after the profit's gone
[17:51] it's our fault it's certainly not God
[17:54] was ready to deliver Israel
[17:57] with Moses
[17:59] right
[18:02] but yet things got all messed up 40
[18:05] years later
[18:06] before Moses came back
[18:08] all right
[18:11] but just think now
[18:15] as I said now I keep stating that to
[18:17] where it stays in your mind we don't
[18:19] believe in just living like the devil
[18:21] and calling ourselves Christians
[18:24] we believe in living the best we can in
[18:28] life
[18:29] but yet realizing that we're going to
[18:31] make mistakes
[18:33] and we cry out for forgiveness
[18:37] not like people would say well what I
[18:40] need to be as forgiveness for God is
[18:41] unconditional
[18:45] you see then you're teaching the
[18:46] children they can just live like the
[18:48] devil and
[18:52] you're saved anyway because they go to
[18:54] church
[18:56] they're named on the book
[18:59] well see that's organized religion and
[19:02] we'll see that's death
[19:04] as the prophet would call it
[19:07] but what about an unconditional Covenant
[19:14] see this is what I was holding off and I
[19:15] knew it'd take a long time to try to
[19:18] express it and it may take this morning
[19:20] but
[19:22] an unconditional Covenant well that
[19:25] means there's no conditions whatsoever
[19:30] a condition was required
[19:33] now listen
[19:35] a condition was required and met
[19:39] before you could have an unconditional
[19:42] Covenant
[19:45] right
[19:49] it was required that God come
[19:52] and deal with Abraham or Abram as we
[19:56] call him and there's word
[20:02] what I want you to look at is something
[20:04] to look at things instead of this well
[20:06] it's just unconditional I just believe
[20:09] the Bible
[20:10] well amen
[20:14] I believe right around especially well
[20:16] amen
[20:17] but has it been revealed to you
[20:20] a lot of difference in the two thoughts
[20:23] right
[20:25] Prophet expressing it if I don't get to
[20:27] it he said
[20:29] there's two classes of people he said
[20:31] one class of people says I go to church
[20:33] I do this I do that I do these things
[20:37] and watch it he said the other class
[20:42] just because within me there's something
[20:46] different
[20:49] I go to church and I do this and I don't
[20:51] do that
[20:52] now what's the difference in the two
[20:54] people
[20:57] can you look at the two people and see
[20:59] the difference no
[21:02] because they're setting in the pews
[21:05] but one of them because of a book of
[21:08] rules
[21:09] is sitting there a law
[21:16] the other one is sitting there because
[21:17] of Grace
[21:20] that has been extended into their heart
[21:23] and from the heart they want to go to
[21:25] church
[21:28] but you know it's hard to read people's
[21:29] faces
[21:31] if I spoke a lot of times here and
[21:34] you know and I look back at you and I'd
[21:37] say well brother College sure ain't
[21:38] agreeing with me because he's frowning
[21:40] it might be hurting
[21:43] might not have a thing in the world to
[21:45] do with
[21:46] expression on his face I can't read them
[21:50] I can't read who comes in the door and
[21:52] stays and who goes out but I've always
[21:54] expressed to you and I wonder why it is
[21:57] but seemingly those who are just at a
[22:00] state of sanctification
[22:03] they want to go to church more than
[22:04] those that
[22:09] claim to be born again
[22:12] right
[22:14] because that's the religious side
[22:20] but truly what does it mean an
[22:22] unconditional Covenant
[22:29] and they had that
[22:31] and wanted something else
[22:38] right
[22:41] that's why I said you read in Exodus
[22:44] without brother Branham I don't know of
[22:46] any author
[22:49] that I've ever tried to read of any
[22:50] footnotes of things or Scofield or some
[22:52] of these other few that I have
[22:56] none of them picked it up
[23:00] that Israel made the greatest mistake of
[23:03] their life
[23:04] that's right he said before Calvary
[23:06] because that's when they turned him down
[23:08] but they made the greatest mistake of
[23:10] their life by choosing law
[23:15] but can you read the Bible and show me
[23:17] that
[23:19] no I got to take what brother Brown says
[23:23] and then I go from what he said I can go
[23:27] back to the Bible then and see
[23:31] because if you read it if you read with
[23:33] me there God is explaining how beautiful
[23:37] perfect
[23:39] Israel are a kingdom of priests
[23:42] a royal priesthood as you take other
[23:45] scriptures
[23:47] explaining how beautiful they look to
[23:51] him
[23:54] and they said
[23:56] but we want something to do right
[24:03] it looks like they're wanting to
[24:06] he wanted them to
[24:08] them because he had said if you keep my
[24:10] Covenant
[24:12] that's what he said
[24:14] now what Covenant is he speaking of
[24:18] he's not speaking of the Covenant with
[24:19] April without him
[24:22] because that and done been broke
[24:28] he was speaking of the unconditional
[24:30] Covenant
[24:32] that he gave the children of Israel
[24:41] then
[24:43] it looks like they wanted to do what he
[24:45] wanted him to do
[24:48] right
[24:51] that's just why I expressed that see you
[24:54] got one group that goes to church and
[24:55] everything
[24:57] but you got another group that goes to
[24:58] church one of them does it by Grace the
[25:00] other one does it by law or works or
[25:03] have to
[25:04] you know what they're both doing they're
[25:06] both trying to serve God
[25:13] true
[25:14] that's right
[25:17] but now here's my thought
[25:21] I laid it down a little bit Wednesday
[25:23] night
[25:25] and I really didn't see the full
[25:27] understanding myself
[25:29] to finish it but I knew there would be I
[25:31] have to be a finish to that message
[25:33] Wednesday so we'll just take it this
[25:35] morning
[25:36] call it part two brother Joe of the
[25:39] unconditional Covenant again because
[25:41] I'll never get on my other notes
[25:46] but you talk about an unconditional
[25:48] Covenant
[25:52] yet it required
[26:00] a savior
[26:05] now that's not on your part
[26:09] all right now still unconditional right
[26:12] it's on God's part
[26:14] right because the only way that he could
[26:15] make an unconditional Covenant was to
[26:19] make an atonement
[26:23] are you following me
[26:27] then you realize
[26:31] that to Abram
[26:34] I say that because a lot of people you
[26:35] know they'll say oh you don't even know
[26:36] who you're talking about Abraham
[26:38] you notice right around him a lot of
[26:40] times he called in Abraham when he's
[26:41] ready to talk about Abram
[26:43] or vice versa that's all right
[26:45] but I say it that way purposely to keep
[26:48] you to hang on to it the code that was
[26:49] made with Abram
[26:51] in his name was changed Abraham
[26:54] because it started a long time before
[26:58] that you read in about Genesis there
[27:04] when he comes down and divides the birds
[27:06] and makes the Covenant
[27:11] you see Church
[27:15] if we think that in unconditional
[27:17] Covenant allows us to just be able to do
[27:21] anything we want to and still be saved
[27:24] then we're totally missing
[27:27] amen the entire thoughts
[27:30] of redemption salvation
[27:35] what God done
[27:38] go to his unconditional
[27:41] then why did he have to come down and
[27:43] finally be sacrificed for you and I
[27:50] so you probably thought of
[27:53] what's he talking about a minute ago
[27:55] when I said an unconditional Covenant
[27:57] was based upon a condition
[28:00] the condition was that God had to do it
[28:04] you agree with that now aren't you
[28:06] following me God done it
[28:11] now
[28:17] then before Exodus 19 where they chose
[28:20] law
[28:23] and after Exodus 19.
[28:28] and today
[28:31] it is still an unconditional Covenant
[28:35] go Jonah 2 and 9 says salvation is of
[28:39] the Lord
[28:45] it's unconditional
[28:50] but it costs the life of almighty God
[28:54] to bring that into being
[29:02] now
[29:04] which came first Grace or law
[29:12] well see if you can't back up any
[29:14] further than Genesis you'll find out
[29:16] that God made a sacrifice so that was
[29:18] Grace
[29:19] but if you can back up enough into God's
[29:21] mind and you know about Revelation 13 8
[29:24] and you'll find it I believe that's
[29:25] right
[29:26] where it says our names were written in
[29:28] the land book of life that was slain
[29:30] before the foundation of the world Amen
[29:32] and then go back and listen to the
[29:34] prophet and you'll hear him talking
[29:35] especially about the old black brother
[29:37] the first one he heard you know and said
[29:39] he took his text of up in heaven
[29:44] he said he spoke of the oldest religion
[29:46] there is in the world
[29:49] he said salvation
[29:51] Christianity
[29:55] because see before the world was over
[29:57] God knew in his mind the world ever
[29:58] started got you in his mind what he was
[30:00] going to do and wasn't going to do
[30:06] now
[30:08] then an unconditional Covenant wouldn't
[30:10] be based upon what we look at it as our
[30:13] human terminologies right
[30:18] right or we'd be totally out of the
[30:19] scripture
[30:21] now the prophet's message
[30:25] see then somebody thought well I got the
[30:27] scripture and I got all the quotes that
[30:28] says
[30:29] it don't matter what I do or don't do
[30:35] that's right
[30:40] and what you do or don't do
[30:44] it matters what God done
[30:48] then I must accept what God done yes
[30:52] right right
[30:54] you remember Wednesday if a pardon is
[30:57] not a pardon until received is a pardon
[31:03] then go set in the jail of the world
[31:07] as I said about the man
[31:10] if the man would have simply walked out
[31:12] and cooked the paperwork
[31:17] he would have never been killed
[31:20] right but he wouldn't do it
[31:25] he would not accept a pardon that's
[31:27] right right
[31:30] see God gave us a pardon but if we don't
[31:33] accept it it's not his fault
[31:35] that's right
[31:36] but now here's what point I was trying
[31:38] to drive that Wednesday we accept God
[31:40] yes
[31:44] but why is it that that a lot of the
[31:47] churches the world the religious Realms
[31:49] and Etc
[31:51] as Billy Graham says 30 000 converts in
[31:54] one meeting
[31:56] and come back and can't find dirty
[31:59] why
[32:01] Yep they're going off and they're all
[32:03] going to heaven
[32:05] because nobody goes to hell no more
[32:07] they're gonna have to do away with it
[32:09] did you heard that brother they'll start
[32:11] a new doctrine they're going to do away
[32:12] with hell everybody else says hell's
[32:14] already here we're living in it you know
[32:17] now that's the doctrine in the message
[32:19] my reason to say this because there
[32:21] ain't gonna be nobody's foot there all
[32:22] right
[32:24] you ain't been to a church in a long
[32:26] time been to a funeral you ever heard of
[32:28] a person preached into hell this
[32:31] person's going to hell no
[32:34] they paid the parking lot they painted
[32:36] the church they done something they gave
[32:38] two dollars an offer and play they
[32:40] believed
[32:43] right
[32:46] the prophet of God made an outstanding
[32:48] or two outstanding statements it really
[32:49] caught with me when I first started
[32:51] studying the message first he said you
[32:54] never saw God
[32:55] right that's right I remember crying and
[32:59] praying and all other things don't you
[33:02] said you never saw God right
[33:05] right he said God sought you
[33:07] then one day I realized it and read the
[33:10] scripture where it says the goodness of
[33:11] God is what leadeth us to repentance
[33:14] it's not the goodness of man it's the
[33:16] goodness of God that leads us to
[33:17] repentance all right now
[33:21] then the other one was and when he said
[33:23] you accept God
[33:27] but he says has God accepted you
[33:34] know as I told you and I still got
[33:35] around looking up the scripture I
[33:36] figured somebody tell me that scripture
[33:38] they're in the book of Acts one time
[33:39] they were praying for the Holy Ghost to
[33:41] come on in people these were born again
[33:43] Christians they were the people of God
[33:46] acts 10 acts 10 acts 10. all right the
[33:50] whole chapter they were actually praying
[33:52] for these people to get the Holy Ghost
[33:53] they were born again filled with the
[33:55] Holy Ghost Christians
[33:58] well yes you couldn't get the Holy Ghost
[33:59] come on
[34:02] you remember that
[34:03] they call for John and who was it
[34:06] when the other Peter Peter and John or
[34:09] Peter called for Peter
[34:12] and they came down
[34:14] and
[34:17] now they got the Holy Ghost
[34:21] who was it in Peter's hands
[34:24] no come on
[34:27] let me open the door to the first that
[34:30] still ain't it yet
[34:33] Peter probably preached him a sermon
[34:37] because nobody gets the Holy Ghost
[34:38] without hearing the word first then you
[34:40] show me that in the Bible or brother
[34:42] runs message either
[34:46] and when they said a few words and laid
[34:48] hands on the Holy Ghost came on
[34:52] not be christianizing the others it was
[34:54] praying
[34:55] it was just something wrong
[34:58] and I come along here I am a resort on
[35:00] with the people but I had people to pray
[35:03] for me for two years everywhere I went I
[35:05] had to come in this message and not as a
[35:07] Baptist deacon at 23 years of age and
[35:09] talked to adults Sunday School classes
[35:11] and everything else when I come in this
[35:12] message I realized I wasn't born again
[35:17] I realized I'd come through
[35:19] justification and sanctification when
[35:20] brother started talking about the new
[35:22] birth I realized I didn't have it where
[35:24] everybody else said they had it cause it
[35:25] come into Mass speech
[35:30] I had to pray for me everywhere brought
[35:32] him out one day he said
[35:33] brother Dale
[35:36] the Holy Ghost is a person
[35:39] he's a person of Jesus Christ which is
[35:42] the word that God reveals into your
[35:45] heart
[35:48] there it was my wife and I both received
[35:50] at the same time
[35:53] why because it's just something wrong
[35:55] with what had been said to me we'll get
[35:58] to that later about organized religion
[35:59] and how they blind us
[36:03] this book The Prophet says they drive us
[36:04] away from the truth
[36:08] but yet we think they're trying to save
[36:10] us and they're doing the best they can
[36:11] we're not against that
[36:15] yeah what is an unconditional Covenant
[36:18] whatever I mean there are no conditions
[36:20] to it
[36:21] well I just brought your condition
[36:24] it meant God
[36:32] we see that wasn't on me and you that's
[36:34] on him
[36:37] so it's unconditional
[36:40] it means you got to check it right
[36:45] pardon another pardon let's receive this
[36:46] one you got to accept it
[36:49] that's right okay looks like a pretty
[36:51] good condition don't
[36:53] see where we mess up is is is the fact
[36:56] that he must accept us then that made my
[36:58] conditions out of non-existence all I'd
[37:00] done was accepted him for what he done
[37:02] for me but when he accepted me
[37:07] he gave me the new birth
[37:09] he gave you the new birth
[37:14] and doing that
[37:15] then now in the New Testament I want
[37:18] this I want to find it in the prophet I
[37:19] want to find it in the Bible that after
[37:21] you're born again
[37:23] I want you to talk to me about an
[37:25] unconditional Covenant
[37:28] after you're born again
[37:32] after you're born again
[37:35] you're only Born Again In Your Soul
[37:38] you're not born again in your body in
[37:39] your spirit right that's right not my
[37:42] body is born again not my spirit it's in
[37:44] my soul
[37:45] then my soul starts working back
[37:46] outwardly right
[37:50] it I automatically receive all of these
[37:52] virtues just because I got born again
[37:55] if I did why did Peter talk about it why
[37:57] did bread around him preached a message
[37:59] and said we didn't
[38:03] all right
[38:08] after you're born again
[38:10] it's not conditions
[38:13] I know that's hard to follow sometimes
[38:18] I don't serve God out of conditions do
[38:21] you
[38:22] know I don't go to church out of
[38:24] conditions you know what I mean well you
[38:27] know I need to go I want to go maybe
[38:29] ought to do this I want to live right
[38:31] see you're making it things that it's
[38:33] not
[38:34] involved in it
[38:37] but from the inward part of me something
[38:39] says there it is and when I was in the
[38:42] Baptist I didn't lay out a church
[38:45] my wife and I were talking the other day
[38:47] about something and even today if we
[38:50] take a vacation there's always a
[38:51] relationship to a church somewhere to go
[38:54] and come back even the kids the other
[38:55] day we said we're going to take off for
[38:56] a week or two
[38:57] you're going to leave while we're having
[38:59] service
[39:03] because they know it's never happened
[39:04] but if we do we'd be sitting listening
[39:06] to you
[39:07] are in a church somewhere
[39:10] because I've never had to do somebody
[39:11] tell me you need to go to church
[39:15] right
[39:17] you don't have to tell me to pay my time
[39:21] I didn't come in the message to learn
[39:23] these things
[39:25] you know
[39:28] you didn't have to tell me that if you
[39:30] tear down the man's fence
[39:32] I've heard sermons on that you know you
[39:35] need to go put it back up you didn't
[39:36] have to tell me that when I was a kid
[39:39] if I tore down a neighbor's fence you
[39:41] better believe I put it back up if I
[39:43] didn't I had to go get his cow put it
[39:45] back in the pasture go apologize to him
[39:47] and then I got a whooping when I got
[39:49] home
[39:51] so you didn't have to tell me no I
[39:53] wasn't supposed to do this or do that
[39:56] we had already started since during our
[39:58] TV
[40:00] before we ever heard of the prophet
[40:04] wouldn't let them watch certain things
[40:09] you see because I always believe that's
[40:10] a Christian Life to Live Like a
[40:11] Christian
[40:14] all right
[40:16] what you see once you get born again
[40:18] it's not a condition I don't serve God
[40:21] to try to appease him
[40:23] you know maybe that's a bad word to use
[40:26] you know or satisfying or or whatever
[40:28] you want to use the word
[40:32] I do it because I love him
[40:35] I don't try to live good because I'm
[40:37] trying to appease some God
[40:40] you'll find out when we get in the
[40:41] message this afternoon maybe that that's
[40:44] what the children of Israel wanted
[40:47] you know what they really wanted I put
[40:48] this in and then get to it this evening
[40:53] give us something to do you know what
[40:55] they wanted
[40:57] they wanted to be like the neighbors
[41:00] around them
[41:04] that built the idols and made their gods
[41:06] and bowed before them and
[41:11] come on second stage was what give us a
[41:15] king
[41:17] right that's right
[41:20] see you'll see a long time together and
[41:22] we'll find out we're just a bunch of
[41:23] organized religion is what we are
[41:25] ain't nothing wrong with organism
[41:27] there's a lot wrong with organization
[41:32] all right let's get back on the talk
[41:38] he realized it when we become a
[41:41] Christian then
[41:44] we serve God from the heart
[41:47] then if I make a mistake
[41:51] come on if you make a mistake what do we
[41:53] do
[41:55] well they don't make no difference I'm
[41:56] safe anyway I just made a mistake okay I
[41:59] can read the prophet he said it wasn't
[42:01] better than what I do or don't do
[42:05] no that proves there's something wrong
[42:07] with the inward man
[42:10] because immediately when you do
[42:12] something wrong you repent right if you
[42:15] don't there's something wrong with that
[42:16] inside
[42:19] well you're making it on conditions
[42:25] relevant
[42:29] God gave it to me
[42:31] the word that he gave me the way to live
[42:34] it
[42:38] come on your Prophet said if you want it
[42:40] no man could keep the law
[42:46] the law is a policeman to put you in
[42:49] jail and nobody could keep it that's
[42:52] right
[42:54] Paul the greatest of all of them said
[42:56] what I thought to be life keeping the
[42:58] law he said I found to be death
[43:01] read the Bible a little
[43:06] so then when we get over into the new
[43:08] birth
[43:09] is it conditions no no it's not
[43:12] conditions
[43:15] it's like the prophet said he said if I
[43:17] go overseas it's gonna take my wife sit
[43:19] down we pray
[43:22] he said I don't say now if you do
[43:23] something around me don't I'll divorce
[43:25] you she grabbed me you do something
[43:26] wrong with it no he said no it's not the
[43:28] way right
[43:30] he said if I go over there and do
[43:32] something wrong
[43:34] and come home and explain it to my wife
[43:37] he said I believe she'd forgive me
[43:40] but he said how could I do it knowing
[43:43] she would
[43:45] now the Earth's where the catch is
[43:47] right he said well don't matter what
[43:48] I've done I know I I know I I don't know
[43:52] something wrong there but I'm saved well
[43:54] anybody said he was lost
[44:01] but just remember my story goes behind
[44:04] always in that
[44:06] that today
[44:09] I do something to brother colleague
[44:13] you know
[44:15] I want to go tell him I'm sorry
[44:19] well
[44:22] about two days later might take two
[44:25] maybe one
[44:26] you know I didn't come up with a thought
[44:28] well it was his problem to start with
[44:30] I don't need to apologize to him
[44:33] he's going to cause me to do it he would
[44:35] have looked at me like that
[44:38] after a while I don't know him an
[44:40] apology he owes me one right right
[44:42] that's right because that's human nature
[44:46] to try to justify our ways and her
[44:48] thoughts that's right
[44:52] so do you understand my point yes
[44:56] yes but that ain't all the point
[45:03] you see it costs a savior to bring us to
[45:05] an unconditional Covenant
[45:14] now under the time of an unconditional
[45:16] Covenant
[45:19] do you realize
[45:22] and we read it
[45:26] and we fail to listen to the prophet
[45:32] he said Israel had Grace
[45:35] watch it
[45:37] he said Grace had given a prophet
[45:41] are you with me
[45:47] he said Grace had give them a pillar of
[45:49] Fire
[45:56] he said Grace
[46:00] gave him a sacrifice
[46:06] and we look at Grace as well it doesn't
[46:07] make no difference from Saved By Grace
[46:11] then we don't listen to The Prophet when
[46:13] he was talking like he remembers
[46:15] condemning the lady that was in the
[46:17] restaurant and and he was going to get
[46:19] up and go over a tour and tell her off
[46:21] you know because she was doing wrong the
[46:23] Lord said come on behind the door I need
[46:24] to talk to you
[46:27] he walked over behind the door and got
[46:29] in the quietness and God showed him a
[46:31] vision and showed him all the things in
[46:33] his life
[46:34] right that he had done
[46:38] and said he showed him then that taking
[46:40] the sight of Jesus the blood and
[46:42] covering for all of his sins
[46:46] it says now you want to be forgiven
[46:49] but said you want me to condemn them
[46:53] right
[46:54] see grace is a little different than
[46:57] what we think of the words because we've
[46:59] been taught by mankind what it means
[47:05] that's why we were on
[47:07] Paul and James Wednesday night and
[47:10] showing they brought around and said it
[47:11] twice there he said they said the same
[47:13] thing
[47:16] well Paul looked like he said was saved
[47:18] by grace
[47:19] James would like to save my words
[47:23] that's got to be saying the same thing
[47:25] or your Prophet was wrong and Paul and
[47:28] James was wrong
[47:32] but it's saying the same thing James
[47:34] brother Rand said was looking at what
[47:36] man saw
[47:37] he said Paul was looking at what God saw
[47:40] all right
[47:46] James was just telling you his works it
[47:48] didn't been displaying his faith
[47:51] Paul was not saying I'm saved by faith
[47:54] what did he say saved by grace what
[47:58] a little word there we want to leave out
[48:00] don't it
[48:01] Say by grace through faith
[48:06] I'll save my grace no that's not the
[48:09] Bible
[48:12] it says by grace through faith
[48:18] but now think about it
[48:20] after he gave Abraham the
[48:23] unconditional Covenant
[48:28] now here's what we're thinking about it
[48:29] so that's reason I'm saying
[48:33] we said well then it'll make no
[48:34] difference what we do
[48:38] he gave Abraham the unconditional
[48:40] Covenant
[48:42] to him and his seat after him right
[48:48] why did they go on making offerings
[48:57] you realize where you're standing folks
[48:59] listen to what I'm saying
[49:02] why were they making offerings of
[49:05] sacrifices why did God command them to
[49:08] make offerings or sacrifices
[49:10] if it was unconditional like we want to
[49:12] make it
[49:18] president don't understand you you talk
[49:20] about unconditional we believe right
[49:21] around unconditional now you're telling
[49:23] us
[49:25] I'm just telling you what the Bible says
[49:30] go back and read from Abraham and
[49:32] Genesis
[49:34] the rest of the chapter
[49:36] and get over into Exodus and go back to
[49:39] about Exodus
[49:41] 10 11 12.
[49:44] we talked to the token
[49:51] where they had to make
[49:53] yearly sacrifices
[49:55] amen
[49:59] the difference between
[50:02] is basically one thing Moses was not the
[50:05] first that made the sacrifice it
[50:07] God made it before the foundation the
[50:09] world is number one
[50:11] two Cain and Abel made it
[50:16] and all of them had to make it
[50:18] until Abraham was even told to take his
[50:21] son up and sacrifice him
[50:25] the sacrifice is not making it on
[50:28] conditions
[50:32] boy
[50:33] you blowed my mind
[50:35] because you just said it was
[50:36] unconditional then you said it was
[50:38] conditioned then you said it's
[50:39] unconditional
[50:46] come on am I right in the Bible they
[50:48] made their sacrifices before you come to
[50:52] Exodus 19. right right before Moses
[50:56] brought the law the law never brought
[50:58] the sacrifice show it to me
[51:03] the long proud condemnation
[51:09] made you to realize you needed to
[51:11] sacrifice
[51:15] it never brought a sacrifice
[51:17] show me in the Bible
[51:23] you see Church
[51:25] we want to play around with little sugar
[51:27] tips or the message I think it's about
[51:29] time we quit playing around horrible
[51:31] we'll read that this afternoon I guess
[51:36] remember they're playing around horrible
[51:40] we've been around horrible long enough
[51:44] we've had 40 something years
[51:47] it's about time to get settled down
[51:51] but I I never thought about an
[51:53] unconditional Covenant the way you
[51:55] preaching it
[51:58] but I thought I had it figured out until
[51:59] you said it
[52:01] now I'm confused well I didn't confuse
[52:03] you
[52:05] no you was already confused
[52:08] don't tell me that well you was I
[52:12] owed it
[52:14] this is why people don't like me and I
[52:16] don't like myself
[52:17] because I before I preach it to you I
[52:19] expose my own self
[52:23] I realize who's standing here talking
[52:28] but everyone said my whole makeup is
[52:30] Grace
[52:33] well why did he ask for forgiveness when
[52:34] he done wrong
[52:36] if that's your terminologies of Grace
[52:39] and unconditionals and whatever
[52:46] day
[52:49] come on
[52:56] unconditional Covenant
[53:00] he gave that Covenant to Abraham and by
[53:03] Abraham receiving it
[53:06] he never stopped
[53:10] making the atonement
[53:13] why didn't he stop
[53:17] because every one of those sacrifices
[53:22] spoke
[53:25] of the time that would come
[53:28] when the god of Glory would stand on
[53:31] Earth
[53:33] he was covering their sins
[53:37] you remember Balaam
[53:39] trying to curse him trying to God says I
[53:42] don't see any wrong but Ron said he
[53:45] couldn't see it because he was looking
[53:46] at what
[53:48] and they say he's looking at an
[53:49] unconditional Covenant come on what did
[53:52] he say he was looking at
[53:54] he said he was looking at the sacrifice
[53:55] they made in the shout of the king in
[53:57] the camp
[54:04] you say are you trying to make it some
[54:05] condition brother Dale there was a
[54:07] condition
[54:09] that required God to die
[54:12] and when man received the unconditional
[54:14] Covenant when Abraham received it he
[54:16] turned right around immediately made
[54:17] offerings from then on why
[54:24] that he was wrong
[54:29] now here's the condition of the
[54:30] existence between
[54:32] I want to express this before get
[54:33] through the difference our condition of
[54:35] existence between the atonements of of
[54:38] the
[54:39] after the Ten Commandments in Moses and
[54:42] his Commandments and those with Abraham
[54:46] Abraham didn't necessarily have to make
[54:48] a yearly that was put in by Moses
[54:50] because God ordained it to be for all
[54:52] the people right one atonement
[54:54] before Moses before that everybody made
[54:58] their own atonement
[55:01] are you with me
[55:03] everybody made their own atonement
[55:06] the head of the household
[55:09] made the sacrifice
[55:12] before Abraham I mean for Moses
[55:16] but then when you come to Moses surely
[55:18] everybody then still had to sacrifice to
[55:20] make they didn't have that one major one
[55:23] that one major one covered for all
[55:25] Israel
[55:26] of a yearly thing
[55:29] Abraham when he go do wrong he'd go out
[55:31] for a sacrifice
[55:33] that was the way that God wanted it to
[55:35] be
[55:41] come on
[55:46] what are we
[55:50] well we'll go to church once a year
[55:53] and make an atonement
[55:56] right
[56:00] now I'm not supposed to repent for what
[56:03] brother
[56:05] Addison does
[56:07] right
[56:09] he's supposed to repent for that
[56:12] I'm supposed to repent for what I do
[56:15] right
[56:17] all right then as a whole atonement
[56:20] that was made at Calvary
[56:26] and if I do wrong he does wrong you do
[56:29] wrong
[56:30] we're not lost
[56:34] if we were truly born again to start
[56:36] with right
[56:38] we're not lost
[56:40] so it's still unconditional
[56:44] he made it
[56:46] but you see he gave me within my heart
[56:49] that's what he wanted with the children
[56:51] of Israel and the people
[56:53] he didn't want to give him law
[56:56] wrote a random says on the message
[57:00] paragraph 90 6 pull up number two we'll
[57:03] just get that known there were to be on
[57:04] the internet
[57:08] number one give me number one first
[57:11] make sure they're on the internet where
[57:12] people won't think this is some idea of
[57:13] mine
[57:19] they wanted a place that they could do
[57:21] something
[57:22] listen what he said here
[57:25] Katie's coming down
[57:27] I wish you would listen we did last
[57:29] night
[57:29] to this message
[57:31] I ask you to Listen to Invisible Union
[57:33] this is not in book form that may be in
[57:36] the brother mammales book form okay
[57:39] all right but it's not in book form for
[57:40] spoken word as far as I know as far as
[57:42] what I've got okay it's in brother
[57:44] mammalists but listen to this tape
[57:47] it's really called Church choose
[57:49] involved for Grace
[57:51] but I want you to listen to that message
[57:54] if you listen to it over and over and
[57:56] when I keep on preaching on it a little
[57:57] while you'll say that's exactly what
[57:59] brother Branham was saying sister told
[58:01] me the other day come to him and handed
[58:03] the Bible said here's exactly what she
[58:05] was talking about
[58:07] I see yeah
[58:09] see she found it in the scripture
[58:10] herself that's what I want you to do
[58:12] it all right
[58:14] look
[58:15] remember case there was only 11 days in
[58:18] the crossing day couldn't believe it
[58:19] because they had already seen so many
[58:21] great things done what
[58:24] they were sure that they were in the
[58:26] will of God
[58:31] what about you and I
[58:34] are we sure
[58:35] just as our fathers was a few years ago
[58:41] look the greatest mistake that Israel
[58:43] ever made was when they renounced Grace
[58:46] and accepted law
[58:50] it made its greatest mistake in Exodus
[58:53] one of the Fatal mistakes that Israel
[58:55] made the Covenant that God made unto
[58:57] Abraham was completely Grace but Grace
[59:00] had provided for them a deliverer a
[59:03] prophet a sacrificial lamb
[59:06] so now you can see that it wasn't just
[59:08] my ideas that they were offering
[59:10] sacrifices before the law came into
[59:12] existence the law never brought
[59:14] sacrifices
[59:15] it is the greatest Revival and all but
[59:19] they wasn't satisfied with it they
[59:21] wanted something they could have
[59:22] something to do into get that decision
[59:24] get to number two because I just want
[59:25] these these two of them
[59:28] go ahead to number two which is God's
[59:30] does God ever change his mind about his
[59:32] word preaching 65 4 18.
[59:36] God permitted Israel to take a law in
[59:39] Exodus the 19th Chapter when Grace had
[59:41] already provided them a prophet Pillar
[59:43] of Fire sacrificial lamb of delivering
[59:45] power
[59:46] and they cried out for a law
[59:48] and we'll get to that this evening
[59:52] it wasn't God's will
[59:57] that's going to be a tough one to try to
[59:58] get your mind in the right order to
[1:00:00] understand it wasn't God's will to bring
[1:00:02] the law what do you mean
[1:00:13] they wanted it
[1:00:16] look what it done
[1:00:18] but it was injected because man wanted
[1:00:21] it
[1:00:23] and he was cursed by the very law that
[1:00:27] he wanted
[1:00:35] next one is a message called well number
[1:00:37] three Abraham's Grace Covenant pre-61
[1:00:40] 317 therefore it's not nothing that we
[1:00:44] could do to Merit it's God's grace that
[1:00:46] gives it to us by faith Abraham believed
[1:00:48] God and it was imputed to him for
[1:00:49] righteousness the law is what man wanted
[1:00:52] not what God wanted
[1:01:03] you poor old hypocrite
[1:01:07] sorry
[1:01:10] but it's time to call nothing Hypocrites
[1:01:13] at least I don't I try to refrain from
[1:01:15] calling names anymore but Hypocrites are
[1:01:18] pretty good word it can cover a lot of
[1:01:19] people
[1:01:21] do you understand
[1:01:22] if what we think of an unconditional
[1:01:24] Covenant if what you thought of an
[1:01:26] unconditional Covenant had no conditions
[1:01:28] in it I hope you listened
[1:01:34] because why did Abraham offer sacrifices
[1:01:37] after he got an unconditional Covenant
[1:01:41] amen
[1:01:43] you got it many deer so go ahead
[1:01:47] at least you got part of it right
[1:01:49] and you gotta admit come God come down
[1:01:52] through an exodus in the beginning and
[1:01:54] begin to give them ordinances or
[1:01:56] whatever whatever you call it the the uh
[1:01:58] you know
[1:02:00] laying in order of the things to be done
[1:02:01] on this day and that to be done on this
[1:02:03] day and that to be done on this day in
[1:02:04] so many days than an offer was to be
[1:02:06] made and this will be made read your
[1:02:07] Bible
[1:02:10] if it's unconditional like we think
[1:02:15] then why did Abraham offer sacrifices
[1:02:17] why did the people offer sacrifices
[1:02:19] until Moses came in existence
[1:02:24] they made it because they knew they was
[1:02:25] wrong
[1:02:29] the Bible says it was after the
[1:02:31] similitude of Adam's transgression
[1:02:34] is the reason they done those things
[1:02:37] they knew they were sinners
[1:02:46] do we realize we're sinners
[1:02:49] saved by grace well Brothers don't make
[1:02:52] no difference what I do
[1:02:54] they don't save
[1:02:57] yeah if you truly saved
[1:02:59] if you truly saved it makes a lot of
[1:03:01] difference
[1:03:03] the difference is after you're born
[1:03:04] again you start seeking after God for
[1:03:07] more things like statue of a perfect man
[1:03:09] striving to climb this pyramid
[1:03:12] trying to serve God trying to be in his
[1:03:15] will and repenting when we do wrong
[1:03:19] but that's been forgotten in the message
[1:03:22] right
[1:03:24] people are so perfect no more we don't
[1:03:25] need to repent
[1:03:28] we don't
[1:03:30] I got a few scriptures and a whole lot
[1:03:32] of the prophets need to be tore out of
[1:03:34] the Bible and that of his message
[1:03:37] you know what I mean by that
[1:03:42] he said he prayed every day for God to
[1:03:44] forgive him
[1:03:46] to lead him
[1:03:48] direct him
[1:03:52] what about you and I
[1:03:54] an unconditional Covenant
[1:03:59] I never heard it like that
[1:04:01] well
[1:04:03] maybe you haven't
[1:04:07] but now you've heard it
[1:04:09] what are you going to do with it
[1:04:11] coach come and show me it's wrong
[1:04:16] that's on the internet that's on
[1:04:17] anywhere else come and show me I'm wrong
[1:04:21] show me one thing that I've been outside
[1:04:23] the Bible today to talk to you about
[1:04:25] well I don't like your attitude that
[1:04:27] ain't in the Bible about my attitude
[1:04:28] that's your attitude too
[1:04:33] God I'll deal with me about my attitude
[1:04:38] you don't have to deal with me about it
[1:04:44] but yet the prophet of God said it and I
[1:04:46] keep quoting it he said if you say it
[1:04:47] soft people don't they think you're
[1:04:49] trying to pull some over on them
[1:04:51] he said say it hard and then you can't
[1:04:53] at least accuse me of being soft soft
[1:04:56] you know
[1:04:57] and you can't say I've changed either
[1:05:01] because when I started right here in
[1:05:03] 1971 the brother mode is a pastor and I
[1:05:06] was a sister I was preaching this hard
[1:05:08] then
[1:05:09] and I haven't changed since then
[1:05:13] as a matter of fact I guess I've got
[1:05:14] harder as far as the way I preach
[1:05:17] I'm sorry
[1:05:19] but is it the truth
[1:05:26] do you understand
[1:05:28] Abraham got an unconditional Covenant
[1:05:30] brother Dale it don't matter what he
[1:05:32] does what he ever does and he's seat
[1:05:33] after him the saved
[1:05:39] now I'd like to see that in the Bible
[1:05:40] and I'd like to see it in the prophet's
[1:05:41] message
[1:05:46] I believe in Salvation being of the Lord
[1:05:48] and I believe in an unconditional
[1:05:50] Covenant that he gave you I've done
[1:05:51] preach that you can't sin enough to be
[1:05:54] lost
[1:05:56] but if you try to sin and it's Sin from
[1:05:58] the inside of your soul you're already
[1:06:00] lost
[1:06:01] so don't try to deal with me about it
[1:06:08] you see then the prophet would say it
[1:06:10] don't matter how high you climb
[1:06:13] make sure you can walk straight when you
[1:06:15] come back down
[1:06:20] see grace
[1:06:24] is unmerited
[1:06:26] you didn't do anything to get it
[1:06:31] but after you get it why wouldn't you
[1:06:33] want to follow what God Said
[1:06:37] you see God didn't want them with a set
[1:06:39] of rules
[1:06:40] he had already given to him
[1:06:44] the ordinances the things to do the
[1:06:48] atonement to be made and to follow the
[1:06:50] prophet right
[1:06:55] I hope you listen didn't want to go when
[1:06:57] I said it differs Moses
[1:06:59] Moses when he said make that one
[1:07:00] atonement that cover for the whole
[1:07:02] Israel
[1:07:04] sure we still have to repent this one
[1:07:07] the true Grace of understanding of
[1:07:09] marriage and divorce is a whole blanket
[1:07:11] covered over the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:07:13] but we still got to repent
[1:07:17] but before then everybody
[1:07:21] made the atonement when they repented
[1:07:23] they made that atonement Abraham would
[1:07:24] do wrong he'd go make an atonement
[1:07:27] any of the others that was our
[1:07:30] they do wrong they would go make an
[1:07:32] appointment for themselves they wasn't
[1:07:34] trying to figure out the neighbor and
[1:07:36] get the neighbor right
[1:07:39] they were concerned with their own lives
[1:07:45] you see that's why there's so much
[1:07:47] falsehood has been put forth before the
[1:07:49] children of this message until they
[1:07:50] don't want the message
[1:07:55] probably because it's been this way it's
[1:07:57] been that way been this way been that
[1:07:59] way you'll see them when we get to it
[1:08:00] won't be this evening probably but when
[1:08:02] we do get to it you'll see that's what
[1:08:04] organized religion has done
[1:08:11] there's a quote something to paraphrase
[1:08:13] that brother run says you can't
[1:08:14] denominate this message
[1:08:15] would say he said they'll organize it
[1:08:17] into lady osia
[1:08:24] nothing wrong with an organism
[1:08:28] a lot wrong with an organization
[1:08:33] but are we so carnal like the brother
[1:08:35] that left a certain Church in this
[1:08:36] message because when they've got their
[1:08:38] internet website run up it says
[1:08:40] something something to org
[1:08:44] you know on your computer you know I
[1:08:47] mean you look at it every day right look
[1:08:49] out there and said orgy you know
[1:08:51] he said that's an organization I ain't
[1:08:53] having nothing to do with it
[1:08:57] all right
[1:09:01] but I will tell you this much it takes
[1:09:03] more than one person to be an
[1:09:04] organization
[1:09:06] takes at least two
[1:09:08] according to Webster
[1:09:12] yeah
[1:09:14] what do you think about an unconditional
[1:09:16] Covenant come on musicians let's stand
[1:09:18] what do you think about an unconditional
[1:09:20] Covenant
[1:09:27] to give your right just live like the
[1:09:29] devil and you're still going to heaven
[1:09:30] anyway
[1:09:32] or does it put you in a situation
[1:09:35] that people don't like to use the word
[1:09:36] condition
[1:09:37] it puts us into a situation
[1:09:41] that we want to serve God
[1:09:48] we don't just go to church then because
[1:09:49] we're good people are supposed to go and
[1:09:51] for don't the preacher is going to say
[1:09:53] something about it
[1:09:57] like I told you I got tired of calling
[1:09:59] people I know I'm not a good pastor I
[1:10:01] agree with you 100 percent
[1:10:04] I got tired of calling people
[1:10:07] I used to call people and say where was
[1:10:08] you at Sunday well I decided to go to
[1:10:10] so-and-so's
[1:10:12] all right I'll just tell you to put that
[1:10:14] go where you want to I ain't gonna call
[1:10:16] you no more if I don't have something
