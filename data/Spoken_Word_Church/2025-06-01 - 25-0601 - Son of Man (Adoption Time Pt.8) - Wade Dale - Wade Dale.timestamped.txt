[27:28] different ones. Father, I pray that
[27:29] you'd be with him. Just bless us now in
[27:31] Jesus name. Amen. All right, we're going
[27:34] to continue on. Uh let's go to Romans
[27:40] 8:15. For ye have not received the
[27:42] spirit of bondage again to
[27:45] fear, but you have received the spirit
[27:47] of adoption, whereby we cry ab. There
[27:51] was one time when you were a child, you
[27:53] cried as a baby. you needed something
[27:56] and God was so gracious he gave it to
[27:58] you. But now he wants us to be grown up.
[28:01] He wants us to be mature enough to be
[28:04] able to handle what he's already gi us.
[28:06] All right. So verse 16, the spirit
[28:08] itself bearing witness with our spirit
[28:11] that we are the children of God. And if
[28:14] children then hes of God, joints with
[28:17] Christ, whatever Christ gets, we get. If
[28:20] so be that we suffer with him. So
[28:22] there's got to be a little bit of
[28:22] suffering going on. And what was I
[28:24] telling you the other day? The suffering
[28:26] is not so much see the Catholic church
[28:28] is, you know, they want to do penance,
[28:30] they're going to beat theirel or they're
[28:31] going to, you know, do something or or
[28:33] or, you know, during Lent time they're
[28:36] going to give up something. That's not
[28:37] what God wants us to do. Our suffering
[28:40] is is that we're not like the world and
[28:43] the world persecutes us because we're
[28:45] not like them. In other words, they shun
[28:47] us. We've lost friends because we've
[28:49] come into this message. Anybody? We've
[28:51] lost friends. Even when we became a
[28:53] Christian, we lost friends. Well, that's
[28:56] the persecution. It's not so much and I
[28:58] we may have to go through some kind of
[28:59] persecution. But the suffering that we
[29:01] have is is not having the the the
[29:05] pleasures of this world. We don't want
[29:08] them as Christians. But now your
[29:11] flesh, come on, somebody. Your flesh
[29:13] still yields.
[29:16] Amen. Without the Holy Ghost, you did
[29:18] those things.
[29:20] So your so your outside man, your your
[29:23] spirit realm is still connected to that
[29:25] old Adamic nature which is drawing you
[29:27] back into the world. But we have the
[29:29] Holy Ghost that called us out of
[29:33] redeemed us, put us into the body of
[29:35] Christ, children, but we must suffer
[29:38] with him that we may be also glorified
[29:41] together. For I reckon that the
[29:42] sufferings and look in re of this
[29:44] present
[29:45] time, they had them back then. The dark
[29:48] ages had them. Every age had the
[29:50] different ones of types of suffering,
[29:53] but our suffering is is we have got to
[29:56] study to show oursel approved. We can't
[29:58] just go to church and let the preacher
[30:00] preach and give you everything you need.
[30:02] That's Catholicism.
[30:05] Amen. Somebody asked me at work about
[30:07] the Catholic religion. I said, "They're
[30:08] just lazy people.
[30:12] We'll go do our mass. We'll be there at
[30:14] 10:00.
[30:16] We don't understand nothing you're
[30:17] saying, priest, but you pray for us. You
[30:20] intercede for us. You be the one that
[30:22] does the work. I'm going to go have fun
[30:24] on Saturday night, but on Sunday, I'm
[30:25] going to come in here with a big bad
[30:26] headache, but you're going to take care
[30:28] of that cuz you're my pope and priest
[30:30] and whatever. We don't believe that. You
[30:31] got to have your own experience with
[30:33] God. You got to have your own catching
[30:35] up. You got to have your own suffering.
[30:37] Yes, sir. Of this present time are not
[30:39] worthy to be compared with the glory
[30:41] which shall be revealed in us. You may
[30:43] be seated and the Lord add his blessing
[30:45] to the reading of the
[30:47] word. Let's continue in the book of
[30:49] Ephesians. Ephesians
[30:51] 1:3 says, "Blessed be the God and father
[30:53] of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed
[30:55] us with all spiritual blessings in
[30:58] heavenly places in Christ." Now, what
[31:00] did brother tell us? The heavenly places
[31:02] was our position.
[31:07] H. Oh, okay.
[31:11] according as he hath chosen us in him.
[31:14] Now we were we were chosen in him. There
[31:18] were others that were chosen of him.
[31:22] The rest of the world, listen, every
[31:24] soul that's ever been in this world was
[31:27] given to them by God.
[31:29] Adolf Hitler, Judas, every soul. God
[31:33] said, "All souls are mine." But when he
[31:36] gives it and imparts it to you, it makes
[31:38] you an individual and gives you a free
[31:40] moral agency to do with what God give
[31:44] you either good or bad. All right? So
[31:47] did God didn't make you evil. God didn't
[31:50] make you good either.
[31:53] It's the goodness of God that leads us
[31:55] to repentance and then we become good.
[31:58] But we were born with a nature totally
[32:02] contrary to God. Yes, sir.
[32:05] I mean, did you not I mean, when you
[32:07] were when you were 8, nine, 10 years
[32:09] old, I mean, you knew that God you you
[32:12] didn't know anything about God. You're
[32:13] just trying to get through
[32:15] life. Amen. Come on. Am I the only one
[32:17] that did
[32:20] this? The teacher was too hard. Your
[32:23] parents were too hard. This was too
[32:24] hard. I had pimples all over my face. I
[32:27] had all this stuff I had to worry about.
[32:30] But God told us that he chose us in him.
[32:34] not of him, in him
[32:38] before the foundation of the world,
[32:41] that we should be holy and without blame
[32:43] before him in love. He saw us already
[32:45] holy. Even though we were born in sin,
[32:48] shaping in iniquity, even though we came
[32:50] to the world contrary to God, he saw us
[32:53] by his fornowledge. We'll get into that
[32:55] in just a minute. By his fornowledge, he
[32:57] saw us perfect. That's right.
[32:59] Now, are we going to Now, the contrary
[33:02] part of that is is we don't believe
[33:03] that.
[33:06] Well, I'm going to say amen myself.
[33:07] Amen.
[33:09] We're contrary to that. We sin and
[33:12] wonder how in the world God puts up with
[33:14] us.
[33:18] Okay, we come to hear from the Lord.
[33:20] Well, then we're going to hear from the
[33:21] Lord today. He's going to tell us that
[33:23] he said we were holy and without blame
[33:28] before him in
[33:30] love.
[33:33] How? Having predestinated us unto the
[33:36] adoption of children by Jesus Christ.
[33:39] What? To himself.
[33:41] So the connection goes back to himself.
[33:44] He's going to have his perfect will. You
[33:48] and I may work in permissive will. You
[33:49] and I may do certain things, but he saw
[33:52] us get into the right will of God before
[33:55] the foundation of the world, before
[33:56] there was a star, before there was an
[33:58] Adam, anywhere. And we'll get to that in
[34:01] just a minute. I want to cover
[34:03] fornowledge today just for a few minutes
[34:05] because we've got to understand, we were
[34:07] looking at Wednesday night. There was a
[34:09] group of people that went across in the
[34:11] promised land and came back. We'll cover
[34:13] that again because I think that's very
[34:15] re revelated and relevant to the age
[34:18] that we're living in. All right? Because
[34:20] there's some that's going to go over
[34:22] into the promised land, get the new
[34:24] birth.
[34:26] Amen. Okay?
[34:29] But they're not going to go on any
[34:30] further. They're going to say, "We're
[34:31] fine right here." Amen. And it didn't
[34:34] knock them out of
[34:36] being the 12 tribes of Israel now. God
[34:40] didn't say, "I'm going to do away with
[34:41] you now." No. God said, Moses said,
[34:42] "That's good. If that's what you want,
[34:45] we'll leave you there." But now, you
[34:48] remember you got brothers on the other
[34:49] side over there, and you got to go help
[34:51] them fight. We'll look at just a minute.
[34:54] So, it's the predestination of God
[34:56] knowing there'd be two groups of people.
[34:57] Knowing there would be a uh actually
[34:59] three groups of people. There would be
[35:01] the mate believers, unbelievers, and
[35:02] true believers. There would be there
[35:04] would be the u a foolish virgin, virgin,
[35:06] and one that don't care. There'd be that
[35:09] same group of people. They're sitting
[35:10] here today. Brother Ram said, "In every
[35:12] service is three kinds of believers." I
[35:16] looked around up there. We were up at
[35:18] the U pastor's convention. Well,
[35:20] pastor's retreat. It wasn't a
[35:21] convention, pastor's retreat. There was
[35:23] about 40 of us in that room. And I
[35:24] looked around and uh I thought, I'm
[35:28] going to say something. You know,
[35:30] Brother Brandham said in
[35:31] every every congregation there was,
[35:35] well, praise the Lord.
[35:39] So, so we were just having we weren't in
[35:42] a congregation. I guess you could say
[35:44] that, but um I kind of did look around
[35:47] and I thought, "Brother Ram did say
[35:53] that. Think about it. Not all Israel is
[35:57] Israel."
[35:58] And I'm not saying anything about them.
[35:59] I love that. That was a wonderful
[36:01] atmosphere. We had a wonderful worship
[36:03] time. And it was that way because I
[36:05] believe that everybody in that
[36:06] congregation was born again and were the
[36:10] seed of God and were people that wanted
[36:11] to further the gospel to the other
[36:13] people. The the worship service and even
[36:15] the worship service here in different
[36:18] places. You can
[36:19] tell you can tell when things are going
[36:22] well. When the when the worship service
[36:23] begins and it all goes good, that means
[36:25] somebody prayed up more than they did
[36:27] before last time. Maybe that means that
[36:30] we got an attitude different than the
[36:31] attitude we had last time we were in
[36:33] this building. Hello, somebody. Okay.
[36:35] Well, anyway, we're human beings. Amen.
[36:39] I told you, put it at the door back
[36:40] there. Nail it up and come on in.
[36:43] And don't pick it up on the way out.
[36:46] Give it to God. Let him destroy it.
[36:48] Having predestinated us into the
[36:50] adoption of children. So he foresaw
[36:53] there was a group of people that was
[36:55] going to be mature in the word of God.
[36:59] He saw a group of people that would
[37:00] mimic Adam before the
[37:03] fall. Adam had full control. He had full
[37:06] control of the weather. He had full
[37:08] control of this whole world. Think about
[37:11] that. And he said, "Now I'm going to
[37:14] have another a group over here now
[37:16] that's going to be by my second Adam
[37:18] that won't
[37:19] fall. the second Eve that won't fall.
[37:23] But I'm not going to have the second Eve
[37:25] as a baby and the second Adam as a baby.
[37:29] Sure, Jesus was a baby in flesh.
[37:33] But he grew up.
[37:36] He grew
[37:37] up and became perfect by his suffering
[37:40] and all those different things because
[37:42] he was a human being, but he was
[37:44] almighty God. All right. So, let's
[37:46] continue on. according to the good
[37:48] pleasure of his will. And what is his
[37:50] will? His will is his word. Today I have
[37:53] opened up and unsealed your will.
[37:57] Someone died so that I could read this
[38:01] today and give you what God gave you
[38:04] when he died. You say, "Oh, God can't
[38:07] die." Jesus died. The flesh man died.
[38:10] Okay? He had to pay a price. He had to
[38:12] be a a a new there had to be a new
[38:15] testament. Right. So the testator had to
[38:19] die. In other words, the one that give
[38:20] it had to pass away. There's no way that
[38:24] that that June's sister died a couple of
[38:26] days ago. There's then now that now they
[38:29] can read the will. Before then, they
[38:30] couldn't read the will. It it wasn't in
[38:32] force. A will is only in force when
[38:35] someone dies. Amen.
[38:38] Well, somebody died to give us this will
[38:43] and I've opened it up. And when you open
[38:45] it up, you're reading what your father,
[38:47] Come on, somebody. You're reading what
[38:49] your father has given you already.
[38:52] He knew you would need it and he already
[38:55] put it in the will.
[39:00] All things.
[39:02] All things he give us. We can overcome
[39:05] all things
[39:07] through Christ who strengthened us. Why?
[39:09] He died to give us the will. Amen. So
[39:12] that we can read this will. It's an
[39:14] open. It's unsealed.
[39:16] The seals have been open. And we can see
[39:19] more than we've ever been able to see
[39:21] before.
[39:22] We can actually see into the mind of God
[39:24] and know exactly what he was thinking
[39:26] about before the world began.
[39:28] Some people had to wait till he wrote it
[39:30] down on a piece of paper to understand
[39:32] what come on. But we did not.
[39:37] You say, "Well, you're doing away with
[39:38] the Bible." No. I'm trying to get us to
[39:40] become the Bible. Amen. Become that
[39:43] written part. That's right. Jesus Christ
[39:45] stepped right out of the Old Testament
[39:47] and lived what the Old Testament said.
[39:49] You and I step out of the New Testament
[39:51] and live what the New Testament tells us
[39:53] to do and the Old Testament. All right,
[39:56] everybody with
[39:57] me? To the praise of the glory of his
[39:59] grace. Not ours. We have none. We have
[40:03] zero grace except from
[40:05] him. wherein he hath made us
[40:09] accepted in the beloved. He's accepted
[40:13] us. He said, "I'm pleased to dwell in
[40:16] you at the new birth." Now, he didn't
[40:19] say, "Here ye him." He said, "I'm
[40:20] pleased to dwell in you. I want you now
[40:24] to be where I can say that. This is my
[40:28] beloved son in whom I'm pleased to
[40:29] dwell. Hear ye him." In other words, if
[40:31] you're going to get it, this is who
[40:32] you're going to get it from. And listen,
[40:34] it's not a one-man show. After Brother
[40:36] Ram left the scene, the prophet of God
[40:38] left the scene. It quit being a one-man
[40:40] show. And even during his time, he
[40:43] didn't make everybody quit preaching.
[40:44] Come on, somebody.
[40:46] Amen.
[40:48] No, everybody preached. Brother Brown
[40:51] said, "Go listen to this one. Go listen
[40:53] to that one. Go listen to this one." He
[40:56] wasn't saying, "Oh, don't listen." He
[40:57] said, "Listen, don't listen to the false
[40:58] teachers."
[41:00] Amen.
[41:01] Now they're trying to do away with the
[41:03] five-fold ministry. I was listening to
[41:05] brother Donnie Reagan yesterday and he
[41:07] said, "You know, I've looked in the
[41:08] message all in the message and William,
[41:11] Mary, and Brandham never said press
[41:13] play." He said, "But now there's a brand
[41:16] that says press play." Think about that.
[41:19] So, Revelations 13:8, I'm telling you,
[41:22] pressing play will not get you adopted
[41:26] and get you to where God can use you
[41:28] like it will. I'm sorry. This is the way
[41:30] you chose it. I don't say you, but your
[41:33] an our ancestors chose this. Remember,
[41:36] children of Israel, God said, "Bring
[41:38] them back to this mountain. I'll speak
[41:39] to them."
[41:41] When they got back to the mountain, what
[41:43] happened? The people said, "No, we don't
[41:44] want God to speak to us. You,
[41:48] Moses, Moses, you go up there and get it
[41:51] all for us
[41:53] and bring it back and we'll believe
[41:54] everything he says." Well, they lied.
[41:58] I wish we could get people to believe
[42:00] and see that this is the way God wanted
[42:02] it done. If this is the way God wanted
[42:05] it done, let's get into it. That's our
[42:07] position. That's our place. That's our
[42:09] placing.
[42:11] All right. We'll get to that in just a
[42:12] second. Revelations
[42:15] 13:8. All that dwell upon the earth
[42:17] shall worship him whose names, who we
[42:19] talking about, the beast. whose names
[42:21] are not written in the book of life of
[42:23] the lamb when slain from the foundation
[42:27] of the world. If man man any man have an
[42:30] ear let him hear. So to begin this thing
[42:32] we got to see that the fornowledge of
[42:34] God is going to give him the
[42:38] opportunity listen to me give him the
[42:41] opportunity to know a group of people
[42:45] before they even come on the face of the
[42:46] earth. Now since you and I are are
[42:50] finite. All right, that means now what
[42:52] does finite mean? Finite means that you
[42:55] cannot know what's going to happen five
[42:56] minutes from now. You can guess. You can
[42:59] try to get
[43:01] close. But God knew what was going to
[43:03] happen before this ever even existed.
[43:07] Omnipotent, omnipresent, omnisient. He's
[43:10] all those things. He's all knowing. He's
[43:12] infinite.
[43:13] So being infinite, he knew exactly how
[43:16] many children was going to accept him.
[43:19] And therefore he could take them, take
[43:20] their picture, put them in a
[43:23] place. Come on. Put them in a place
[43:26] which was not over here somewhere. It
[43:27] was in him.
[43:30] In him was where we were. We weren't in
[43:32] an album sitting somewhere in heaven.
[43:34] Now remember, brother R said there is an
[43:36] album. Well, that album is what? It's
[43:38] inside of him and now it's being
[43:40] developed right here. But remember, if
[43:43] you could see by spiritual eye, every
[43:45] one of your names are right here. Isn't
[43:47] this the lamb's book of life? Now, we're
[43:50] looking at the eternal section. Now,
[43:51] there's this is the lamb's book of life.
[43:53] It talks about
[43:54] Judas. It talks about all the sinners
[43:57] and different ones. But in here, in the
[44:00] part that you see that's eternal, that's
[44:03] where your name is.
[44:05] That's the name that I want in this
[44:07] book. I don't care to have it in man's
[44:08] book. I don't want to have it in just
[44:10] the book of life. The book of life is
[44:13] you're going to be judged. If I'm in the
[44:15] lamb's book of life, hallelujah, I've
[44:17] already been judged. I don't have to go
[44:19] to the white throne judgment. Why would
[44:21] we have to go twice?
[44:23] You say, "Well, I can't do that." You
[44:25] just stopped yourself right there.
[44:27] You just stop. You become an unbeliever
[44:30] when you say that.
[44:33] Don't ever say, "I can't."
[44:37] Don't ever. Because if you're a child of
[44:39] God, everything is laying at your feet.
[44:43] Everything. I'm not going to read it
[44:45] today, but later on, Brother R said,
[44:47] everything you needed for your journey,
[44:49] you got when you were born again.
[44:52] Now, remember each and every one of you
[44:54] by type as a human being, all of you
[44:57] brothers and sisters that's grown up and
[44:59] had kids, you understand what I'm
[45:01] saying? You had no new parts when you
[45:02] were born.
[45:04] You didn't grow a new part. You just
[45:06] grew.
[45:08] You developed here and here, but you had
[45:11] every part you needed when you started
[45:12] your journey. Amen. You might need you
[45:15] might have not had teeth, but they were
[45:17] inside your head somewhere.
[45:19] They didn't have to give you false ones
[45:21] like we like they do us now. So, it grew
[45:24] right inside of you. Why? So, everything
[45:25] you've got in type then by your new
[45:28] birth, everything you got, you may not
[45:29] be able to see it because if you desire
[45:32] the sensial, I just caught that. If you
[45:34] desire the sincere milk of the word,
[45:36] you've got teeth. They just hadn't shown
[45:39] up yet. Amen. You got hair. It just
[45:42] hadn't shown up yet. Now, some of us,
[45:44] Brother Joe and myself, is heading in
[45:46] the back the other direction. But that's
[45:48] okay. God knew wherever one of them was.
[45:50] Yes, sir. He marked them and you're
[45:52] going to get them right back.
[45:56] But it just hadn't fully developed yet.
[45:58] You haven't fully developed
[46:01] as a Christian. We He's coming back for
[46:04] a fully developed group of people
[46:08] and he gave us provisions to make it.
[46:11] How in the world would God that knew
[46:14] everything would get you in a part of
[46:16] your journey and then
[46:18] say, "I don't think he's going to make
[46:20] it." He knows whether you make it or
[46:22] not. And he put everything you needed,
[46:25] all of your vitamins and nutrition, he
[46:28] gave it to you at the new birth. Now,
[46:30] does that mean you're adopted? No. Cuz
[46:33] when you were born a baby, you weren't a
[46:34] full- grown child. You had to develop
[46:37] over the years. We've had what, brother
[46:39] Brown's been gone almost 70 years. We've
[46:41] had to develop from children that was
[46:44] dos and don'ts and you know, you dress
[46:46] this long and don't cut your hair and
[46:48] this happened. That happened, this
[46:49] happened. Don't wear sleeves, wear
[46:51] sleeves. Don't wear wedding band. Wear
[46:54] wedding.
[46:58] But it was a journey we had to go
[46:59] through. Right? We had to go through
[47:01] that journey. But we're here now where
[47:03] what God commands all of us to grow up.
[47:07] And being being that he forneew a group
[47:11] of people, we're going to read it here.
[47:13] He knew somebody would do it.
[47:16] You've just got to look in your mirror
[47:18] and say, "He's talking about me. He saw
[47:22] me come to this place."
[47:26] Oh, no. I'm waiting
[47:28] for God's waiting on you. He's not
[47:31] waiting on your husband or your sons or
[47:33] your daughters or your
[47:35] pastor. God's waiting on you to come to
[47:37] a place. He's waiting on you to get your
[47:40] what? Your full allotment of what God
[47:42] saw you. God saw some that wouldn't
[47:44] didn't want it. It was just like the
[47:45] ones that went over fall into the
[47:46] promised land come right back over here.
[47:48] We'll read in just a second. And that's
[47:50] a wonderful type of what's going on now.
[47:54] Romans
[47:55] 8:29, for whom he did forno. Now, that
[47:58] word forno in the Bible means awareness
[48:02] of something before it happens or even
[48:07] exists. Now, we can't do that. So, it
[48:10] has to be God.
[48:12] Everybody with me? So, who's that? He
[48:15] that he is God. for whom he did
[48:20] forno or have fornowledge of or have an
[48:23] awareness. And it wasn't that God just
[48:26] had a thought. His thoughts are eternal.
[48:28] Remember, every time he has a thought,
[48:29] it's eternal. And it has to be made
[48:30] known. It can't be changed.
[48:35] For whom he did forno, he also did
[48:37] predestinate. What does predestinate
[48:39] mean? Predetermined destiny. Now, if you
[48:42] look at that one word, just as
[48:45] predetermined or predestination, because
[48:48] it says right here, we're
[48:50] predestinated to be conformed to the
[48:52] image of his son. Predestinated when?
[48:54] Before the foundation of the world. And
[48:56] that word does mean
[49:00] predestination or
[49:02] pre-determined destiny. All right. But
[49:05] now it's not like God said, "All right,
[49:08] I'm going to make Sister Emma do XYZ,
[49:11] and she can't do nothing else.
[49:14] Sister Emma
[49:15] Senior, I'm sorry, not
[49:18] Junior. He's not going to take you and
[49:21] say, "All right, this is the way I'm
[49:22] going to do you, and I'm going to," like
[49:23] Brother Ram said, he's not going to put
[49:24] you in a tube and pull you through and
[49:26] say, "This is the way I want you."
[49:30] No, he's not going to say, "Well, now
[49:32] Brother Collie, I'm going to pick him,
[49:33] but I'm not going to pick Sister
[49:35] Charlotte." No, there ain't no picking
[49:36] to that. He already knows. You're the
[49:38] one that's going to have to talk about
[49:39] it. You're the one that's going to have
[49:40] to talk to God and say, "Hey, God,
[49:41] please. Hey, me. This is me. This is me.
[49:45] You forneew me." You know how I know you
[49:48] forneew me? Because you're in me. I feel
[49:51] that part in me. I know that I'm
[49:54] predetermined.
[49:56] But my predetermined destiny is because
[49:59] God saw what you would do because you're
[50:01] a free moral agent. You can accept or
[50:04] reject anything.
[50:06] Amen. He's looking back, you know, he's
[50:08] talking about the popes, you know,
[50:09] brother Bam even tells us that uh Pope
[50:12] Augustine of Hippo that the Holy Ghost
[50:14] tried to come upon him and he and he
[50:16] rejected it. Now, how many people do you
[50:18] think in the world that's happened
[50:21] to? I hope it's happened to none of us
[50:24] because when you turn the word down like
[50:25] that, there's nothing else for you.
[50:27] Amen. But if you didn't turn it down,
[50:30] praise God. If you didn't turn it down,
[50:33] you're a son and daughter of God and you
[50:35] get all the things that he had and has
[50:39] and will
[50:40] have for whom he did for know. So by for
[50:43] knowledge, so knowledge beforehand. So
[50:46] before So before
[50:49] predestination, everybody with me here
[50:52] before predestination. Because if you
[50:54] look at predestination, that does mean
[50:56] God pulled you through a tube and said
[50:58] this, you're going to be a
[51:00] preacher or you're going to be a or
[51:03] you're going to be a
[51:05] No, he
[51:07] forneew and saw your
[51:11] He saw your whole life
[51:14] from beginning to end.
[51:17] He saw you,
[51:19] your life, and what you would do. Hey,
[51:22] I'm going to present the will right
[51:24] here. What are you going to do about it?
[51:25] Oh, I'll take it. It's mine.
[51:29] He's gonna He's going to see a little
[51:30] lady called Hattie It Right. Didn't have
[51:31] any money. Had a sister that was all
[51:34] messed up physically.
[51:38] He saw her down in time. He saw her say,
[51:43] "That ain't nothing but the truth."
[51:45] Well, listen. God can't change his mind.
[51:48] Amen. So there's no way if he ever loved
[51:51] you, he'll never unlove you. If he saw
[51:54] you accept him, he'll never say, "No, I
[51:56] don't want them."
[51:58] No, I don't want them. I don't want
[51:59] them. No. If he saw you give everything
[52:02] you had,
[52:04] God forgive me of all my sins. I'm
[52:07] laying them right here. I'm laying them
[52:09] on the altar. I'm just exposing myself.
[52:12] He said, "That's my child. I saw you do
[52:15] that before the foundation of the world.
[52:17] Amen. I saw a quote not too long ago.
[52:20] When we get to heaven, God's not going
[52:22] to look at us and say, "Why'd it take
[52:23] you so long?"
[52:27] He
[52:28] knew. He knew how long. You know what
[52:32] he's going to say? Enter into the joy of
[52:34] the Lord.
[52:37] That was prepared for you before the
[52:38] foundation of the world.
[52:42] Oh, what a mighty God we serve.
[52:45] We make God so limited
[52:48] in our finite mind. We make him so
[52:51] limited that he just can't think that.
[52:53] Yeah, he thought that. You know why? Cuz
[52:56] right here. For whom? Whom? Whom?
[53:03] He
[53:04] God did
[53:07] forno. He also did predestinate to be
[53:10] conformed what? To the will. Yes.
[53:14] Conformed to the will of
[53:17] God, conformed to the image of his son,
[53:20] that he might be the firstborn among
[53:21] many brethren. Talking about Jesus
[53:23] Christ. Now watch. Moreover, whom he did
[53:26] predestinate. All right. Now look, watch
[53:29] because remember, we'll read it in a
[53:31] minute. Brother Ram said predestination
[53:33] looks back to fornowledge.
[53:36] If it don't look back to fornowledge,
[53:38] then he did predetermine everything. And
[53:39] there's no other way it can go but this
[53:41] way.
[53:43] But by
[53:44] fornowledge, he can predestinate. The
[53:47] footsteps of the righteous are what?
[53:50] Ordered of the Lord. He already put his
[53:52] order in before the foundation of the
[53:54] world. Before you even got here, he put
[53:56] your order in. Cuz he saw what you do
[53:58] when you came here. He saw you would
[54:00] respond or not respond. He saw you would
[54:03] change and ask God to change your life
[54:05] or be so hardcrusted that there's no
[54:08] way. I believe God gave Adolf Hitler a
[54:12] chance to be saved. If he listen folks,
[54:16] if he gave Cain an opportunity
[54:19] and listen, it wasn't through a preacher
[54:21] either or a prophet. God went down and
[54:23] said, "Cain, if you'll do like your
[54:25] brother, you'll be accepted." But if
[54:28] not, sin lies at your door. We were
[54:30] Sister Julie and I were talking about
[54:32] Cain. Why did God put a mark on Cain?
[54:36] Why'd he put a mark on Cain, which is
[54:38] the mark of the thief? You know why he
[54:39] put a mark on Cain? Not what Cain
[54:44] did even to kill his brother or to bring
[54:48] fruit. The Bible
[54:51] said, he left the presence of God. Amen.
[54:56] That's right. When you leave the
[54:58] presence of God, that is the mark of the
[55:00] beast.
[55:02] Amen. Amen. Right. Mark of the beast is
[55:05] not anything else but you leaving God.
[55:10] Amen. You've left him. And listen, Cain
[55:13] didn't go back either. Amen. Kane
[55:16] purposed to leave. He didn't want to be
[55:18] around that man that was telling him
[55:19] what to do. God. Amen. Amen.
[55:23] And then the reason, as we were talking
[55:25] yesterday, the reason, you know,
[55:27] remember God said, I'm going to put a
[55:28] mark on Cain. Don't kill nobody. Kill
[55:30] him. Why? because his purpose had to be
[55:33] made. He had there had to be a lineage
[55:36] of Cain that was artificers that made
[55:38] wood and and that made stone and all
[55:40] those different things. But remember,
[55:41] they were contrary to God all the way
[55:43] through. Now remember, it's not a
[55:45] natural lineage. But that lineage
[55:47] started somewhere because the mind of
[55:49] Cain was the mind of the devil.
[55:53] Amen. And when he left, that's exactly
[55:55] what the mark of the beast is. It's you
[55:58] having the mind of Satan and not letting
[56:00] the mind of God in and saying, "I don't
[56:02] want that." That's exactly what Cain
[56:05] did. That's right. He went out from the
[56:08] presence of the Lord. Don't ever leave
[56:11] the presence of the Lord.
[56:14] Always try to be around. Be
[56:16] aware. Moreover, whom he did
[56:19] predestinate them, he called. Now, why
[56:22] would he call you if he already knew
[56:24] what he was going to do?
[56:27] Everybody with me? It's a little bit off
[56:29] adoption, but it's okay. We got new
[56:31] people here. Okay, everybody with me?
[56:35] Okay, we got to get to adoption. But
[56:36] until we understand where we came from
[56:40] and what we're doing here,
[56:43] well, I just one day just I just God
[56:46] surprised me out in a closet one day and
[56:48] just No. Remember, you don't call on
[56:52] God. God calls on you. That's right
[56:57] because you have to respond according to
[56:59] the fornowledge that he saw what you
[57:01] would do. So he predetermined that right
[57:03] here is where I'm going to meet you.
[57:05] He's going to Adolf Hitler is going to
[57:06] go to the white throne judgment. God is
[57:07] going to say, "This day right here is a
[57:10] day I came to
[57:11] you to give you eternal life and you
[57:14] rejected it."
[57:18] If he don't, he's a respector of
[57:20] persons, folks. Amen. Because somebody
[57:23] at the day of judgment, if they make if
[57:26] if if God said, "Now, I'm going to make
[57:28] Aaron Roberts. He's going he's going I'm
[57:30] going to make him be my
[57:33] child. I'm going to put something
[57:35] special in him from his baby birth."
[57:39] Everybody with
[57:40] me? And and and then I'm going to just
[57:43] take care of him. I'm just going to put
[57:45] a like Job. I'm going to put a hedge
[57:48] around him and I'm going to let nothing
[57:50] touch him. and he's just going to fly
[57:53] off into
[57:56] eternity. And then Joe then John Jones
[57:59] from the street, he comes walking
[58:01] up and God says, "Get out of here. I
[58:05] didn't even think of you. This is my
[58:08] child right here." See, that's a
[58:10] respector of persons.
[58:13] But when everybody is put on the same
[58:15] level,
[58:17] that's right. If you ever reject God,
[58:19] he's going to have to show you being a
[58:22] righteous judge. Every person in the
[58:24] world, he's going to have to say, "Right
[58:26] here, this day, you rejected me." St.
[58:30] Augustine a hippo, you could have been a
[58:31] born again believer, but right here, you
[58:33] turn me
[58:34] down. That's the fornowledge of God
[58:37] knowing that you would turn it down or
[58:40] that you would accept it. Amen. And when
[58:42] you accept it, you are predetermined
[58:44] then, but you were pred predetermined in
[58:47] the mind of God before the foundation of
[58:49] the world. Everybody with me? Have I
[58:51] lost anybody yet? Are we good?
[58:55] Because what is fornowledge? Remember,
[58:56] it's the awareness of something before
[58:58] it happens.
[59:00] I wish we could h and listen, we do get
[59:02] a little bit of that
[59:04] insight. Come on. Don't you get that
[59:06] little tug or something says don't go
[59:07] down that road or this tug that says
[59:09] don't do this or this tug that says do
[59:11] this or this tug that says get out of
[59:12] the way.
[59:17] Those that are of God are led by the
[59:19] what? Spirit of God. Listen every once
[59:22] in a while.
[59:25] Moreover, whom he did predestinate them,
[59:27] he also called. So look, he called. Now
[59:30] remember when he did he didn't say them
[59:32] he also
[59:38] picked. Picking is not
[59:41] fornowledge. That's predetermined that
[59:43] you're going to be this or that or the
[59:44] other. No. Them he also called. He made
[59:49] the call. You responded one way or the
[59:52] other. Amen. And whom he called. Now
[59:55] watch. whom he called them. He also
[59:58] justified group of people
[1:00:01] and whom he justified, not you. There's
[1:00:04] a lot of people going to stand at the
[1:00:05] white throne judgment and going to try
[1:00:07] to justify what you did.
[1:00:12] Remember book of Revelations, what was
[1:00:14] the book open? The book of life was
[1:00:16] open. And what did it say? They were
[1:00:18] judged by the things that they done,
[1:00:21] their works.
[1:00:23] God don't ever let me be judged by my
[1:00:25] works.
[1:00:27] The reason I'm in the eternal section is
[1:00:30] I took his works.
[1:00:33] He took me to Calvary inside of him. I
[1:00:37] don't have to go there anymore. He went
[1:00:39] to hell with me. I don't have to go
[1:00:40] there anymore either. Amen. He said,
[1:00:43] "Where'd he do that?" Well, remember
[1:00:44] when he died, he went to preach to the
[1:00:47] souls in prison.
[1:00:50] He went to hell. got the keys. Well,
[1:00:53] where were you? You were in that
[1:00:55] theophony. You were his children. You
[1:00:56] were his progyny. You were inside of
[1:00:58] him.
[1:00:59] All right. Is everybody with me? Now
[1:01:03] watch those he justified. He's going to
[1:01:06] glorify you. If you justify yourself,
[1:01:09] you'll never be glorified.
[1:01:12] Adoption series. Brother Adamson.
[1:01:18] Watch. What was the salvation he was
[1:01:21] trying to tell them? Predestinated
[1:01:23] before the foundation of the earth. Is
[1:01:25] that right? To the adoption of sons. We
[1:01:27] just read that he predestinated us to
[1:01:30] adoption. Not everybody's going to get
[1:01:31] there. He predetermined a group that is
[1:01:34] going to get there because he saw them
[1:01:35] by fornowledge. Is everybody okay with
[1:01:37] that? God didn't decide this all by
[1:01:41] himself.
[1:01:44] No, he saw what you do. Then he made a
[1:01:47] decision for knowledge to know what you
[1:01:50] did. Then down here predetermine what
[1:01:53] you did because of what he saw you
[1:01:55] already do. We can't fathom that because
[1:01:58] we don't even know what's going to
[1:01:59] happen five minutes from now. One minute
[1:02:02] from now, but he had this thing all the
[1:02:05] way
[1:02:07] out. Now after you come into eternal
[1:02:09] life, that means you didn't have it at
[1:02:11] one time. Now you got it. Now, after you
[1:02:14] come into eternal
[1:02:15] life, after you've been saved,
[1:02:18] sanctified, filled with the Holy Spirit,
[1:02:20] you're sons and daughters of God. Is
[1:02:21] everybody with me?
[1:02:24] Now, God wanting to place you
[1:02:28] positionally, place you. See, he doesn't
[1:02:30] want to just He's going to save you,
[1:02:31] sanctify you, fill you with the Holy
[1:02:32] Ghost. And then,
[1:02:35] see, this church believes in and then.
[1:02:37] Amen. We believe in going on further
[1:02:40] with God. We don't want to just go in
[1:02:41] the promised land and come back out and
[1:02:42] we're satisfied where we at.
[1:02:45] We want to keep going on. We want to
[1:02:46] keep fighting. We want to be that group
[1:02:48] that keeps taking over the land. Amen.
[1:02:52] Your sons now God wanting to place you
[1:02:55] positionally. Oh, that now watch so that
[1:02:59] you can work for the kingdom and his
[1:03:03] glory. That's
[1:03:05] why he wants to position. He
[1:03:08] positionally place you. He wants you to
[1:03:11] work for the kingdom of God. Remember
[1:03:13] power apart from character satanic.
[1:03:16] And I read that quote where brother said
[1:03:18] we become a stumble block or a stumbling
[1:03:19] block to a to a new Christian. If you're
[1:03:22] if you've been sitting here for 30
[1:03:24] years, I'm sorry. If you've been sitting
[1:03:25] here for 30 years and then a new
[1:03:27] Christian comes in and you start acting
[1:03:29] like one that was just act like that guy
[1:03:32] that just came in, there's an issue
[1:03:34] there.
[1:03:36] Your growth's been stunted. You have
[1:03:38] been eating the wrong food. You've been
[1:03:40] eating on the garbage of the world.
[1:03:42] You've been watching all the movies out
[1:03:44] there and the YouTube. I guarantee you,
[1:03:46] some of y'all sitting here sleep, you
[1:03:47] wouldn't fall asleep if you had a good
[1:03:48] movie
[1:03:55] on Right. Would you? I mean, a good one,
[1:04:00] Daniel. A good Yeah. No, you were
[1:04:02] misleading. A good movie.
[1:04:06] Good to have brother Dan Star Trek. Oh,
[1:04:09] I'm
[1:04:10] sorry. Which one? Three, four. I'm
[1:04:14] just all human. But it's what your
[1:04:17] desire is and where your desire comes
[1:04:18] from. It's inside here. Okay. We know
[1:04:22] Satan's playing with your head. He's
[1:04:23] trying to get you to go to sleep. He's
[1:04:24] trying to make you comfortable. But
[1:04:26] fight it. At least try to fight it.
[1:04:29] I mean, really try to fight it. If you
[1:04:31] want to whack yourself upside the head,
[1:04:32] that's fine. If you don't, I'll get the
[1:04:34] deacons to do it for you and somebody
[1:04:36] will do
[1:04:38] it. I'll get a sister to do it. That way
[1:04:40] you can't get mad at
[1:04:42] her. Praise the
[1:04:46] Lord. Listen to this.
[1:04:49] Predestination looks back to
[1:04:52] fornowledge. Now watch what he's saying.
[1:04:53] Now watch. He brings election in. Now
[1:04:56] remember what is election? Election is
[1:05:00] there's votes being cast. Amen. That's
[1:05:03] why it's called an election. All right.
[1:05:06] If if I run for an office and and
[1:05:09] brother Ryan runs for the same office,
[1:05:11] whoever gets the most votes wins the
[1:05:14] election. All right? So, you got two
[1:05:17] forces. You got God and you got the
[1:05:19] devil. Amen. God always voted for you.
[1:05:23] Satan always votes against you. So, how
[1:05:26] you going to get a two to one vote to
[1:05:29] win the election? It's left up to you.
[1:05:33] Your vote counts. I don't care about out
[1:05:36] there. I'm talking about in here. Your
[1:05:38] vote counts out there, but it also
[1:05:39] counts in here.
[1:05:42] Election, now watch. Election though
[1:05:45] looks
[1:05:47] back. Election has to look back.
[1:05:51] Everything had to start from
[1:05:53] fornowledge.
[1:05:56] He knew you'd vote for God or he knew
[1:05:58] you'd vote for the devil. Therefore, he
[1:06:00] predetermined what your destiny would
[1:06:02] be. Just as simple as it ever. I mean,
[1:06:06] predestination can can look bad, but if
[1:06:08] you'll just look at it by fornowledge.
[1:06:12] Those he forneew he did predestinate.
[1:06:17] Now watch. So election looks back to
[1:06:20] fornowledge. And
[1:06:21] predestination looks to your
[1:06:24] destiny. You're living your destiny
[1:06:26] right now. Amen. But by for for
[1:06:29] knowledge, God knew what it would be.
[1:06:31] Listen, this is what I believe. I'm not
[1:06:34] saying anything about this church or or
[1:06:36] the people here. I'm just saying God
[1:06:38] give you an opportunity to come to a
[1:06:39] good church. Amen. God give you an
[1:06:42] opportunity to listen to the true word
[1:06:45] of God.
[1:06:47] Amen. He gave you opportunity. What are
[1:06:49] you going to do? Are we going to sleep
[1:06:51] through it? Are we going to go to
[1:06:52] Walmart instead of go to church? What
[1:06:54] are we going to do? Right.
[1:06:56] That's nothing to me, folks. I'm telling
[1:06:58] you. It ain't me. It's the word that
[1:07:02] comes forth out of my mouth is what you
[1:07:04] got to listen to. I hope I'm living up
[1:07:07] to I live up to it. I'm praying I live
[1:07:09] up to it. But you don't put everything
[1:07:11] on your pastor. Even the deacons, we'll
[1:07:14] fail you. Brother Ram even said that. He
[1:07:16] said, "Don't look at me. I'll fail you."
[1:07:19] But God will never fail you. And let me
[1:07:22] tell you something else. The word of God
[1:07:24] will never change. It's supposed to
[1:07:27] change you.
[1:07:30] The word never changes, but the word
[1:07:32] will change you. It has changing power,
[1:07:35] not to change itself, but to change you.
[1:07:38] Amen. Listen, something there's a fire
[1:07:40] has to go inside your soul that wants
[1:07:43] the word so bad.
[1:07:46] That you can't wait, as brother Ram
[1:07:47] said, for those doors to open. You can't
[1:07:49] wait to get in here to say, "What do you
[1:07:51] got for me today, Dad? What do you got
[1:07:54] for me today, Father?"
[1:07:57] Yes, sir.
[1:08:00] Ain't there just places though that you
[1:08:02] like to be and then there's places you
[1:08:03] don't like to be, right? Why? Because it
[1:08:07] either fits your fancy or you can watch
[1:08:09] Star
[1:08:11] Trek. That was that was one of my
[1:08:14] favorite. But anyway, we're all human
[1:08:16] beings.
[1:08:18] But now watch, let's continue on. We'll
[1:08:21] get done here in a
[1:08:22] minute. Don't forget that that election
[1:08:25] looks back here. Here it is. Now watch
[1:08:28] what he's going to say. Now, brother
[1:08:31] Brandham, what were you
[1:08:34] born? William Brandham, the prophet of
[1:08:37] God. God sent in the end time. According
[1:08:40] to Malachi 4, he sent us a vindicated
[1:08:43] prophet.
[1:08:46] That's why we're sitting here today.
[1:08:53] Now, Brother Adam, you were just
[1:08:54] perfect.
[1:08:57] You were not born in
[1:08:59] sin. You were a wheat to be
[1:09:02] born. You did everything right. Your
[1:09:05] parents never whipped you. Oh my
[1:09:09] word. Right. Oh, he brother Brandham, he
[1:09:13] always went to church. No, he did not.
[1:09:18] He told
[1:09:21] lies. Hold on to your
[1:09:23] seat. He tried to commit suicide twice.
[1:09:30] He would have been a murderer if God
[1:09:32] would have let those bullets go off. He
[1:09:33] was going to kill. He had an Irish
[1:09:37] temper. Praise the Lord.
[1:09:43] father and mother and all my whole
[1:09:45] family
[1:09:49] sinners. I was a cuckle
[1:09:52] bear. But all of a sudden, if you'll
[1:09:54] read his testimony out there, wherever
[1:09:56] it was, in the pig pen or on the rail
[1:09:58] tracks or somewhere, God met him and
[1:10:00] changed him into a what? A wheat germ or
[1:10:04] a wheat grain. But all of a sudden, I
[1:10:06] became a wheat grain. How did it happen?
[1:10:09] What is that
[1:10:11] election? God before the foundation of
[1:10:14] the world elected. Hold on a
[1:10:17] minute. Elected. There there was going
[1:10:21] to be a transformation.
[1:10:27] A
[1:10:29] transformation. There's a big difference
[1:10:31] in a cocoa bar and a wheat. You can eat
[1:10:34] wheat. Try to eat a cocoa bar.
[1:10:38] A cocka bar will stick you and if you if
[1:10:41] you can't find it, it'll keep sticking
[1:10:42] you. When you do find it, one of them
[1:10:44] legs will fall off and it'll keep
[1:10:45] sticking you.
[1:10:47] That's our nature. That's our
[1:10:50] stickiness. But a wheat plant just does
[1:10:52] what? A wheat plant just grows and it
[1:10:55] just what, brother Bam said, it just
[1:10:57] waves in the wind. And what happens is
[1:11:00] they take it and crush it and grind it
[1:11:03] and make food, make bread.
[1:11:07] What is it? Election. God before the
[1:11:09] foundation of the world elected that the
[1:11:11] cuckabar was to become a grain of wheat.
[1:11:15] Now I know I'm a grain of wheat. Because
[1:11:17] what? Because I'm saved.
[1:11:20] How did I do it? Look back and see that
[1:11:23] he predestinated it long time ago. By
[1:11:27] fornowledge. He seen that I would love
[1:11:29] him by fornowledge. Not by
[1:11:31] predestination. By forn knowledge he saw
[1:11:35] he
[1:11:36] God seeing that I William Brandham I way
[1:11:39] Dale put your name in there would love
[1:11:41] him.
[1:11:43] So he made a perpetuation through his
[1:11:45] own son that through him I might become
[1:11:49] from a cuckabar to a grain of wheat.
[1:11:51] That's the transforming power of God to
[1:11:53] me. That's redemption. Redemption is
[1:11:55] what? Not replacement.
[1:11:58] He didn't say he replaced me. He said he
[1:12:00] transformed me.
[1:12:03] transformed by the renewing of my mind.
[1:12:05] What? Look at Paul.
[1:12:08] Paul was a church age messenger. Paul
[1:12:10] was a prophet. Paul wrote 80% of the New
[1:12:12] Testament. He spent almost half his life
[1:12:17] persecuting Christians.
[1:12:20] Half his life, not a season, half his
[1:12:23] life. He said, "Give me the papers. I'll
[1:12:26] put him in jail."
[1:12:28] He was so bad till the guy that God
[1:12:31] showed to pray for him and nice said now
[1:12:34] Lord are you sure
[1:12:36] I
[1:12:37] mean that brother Aaron now he's pretty
[1:12:40] rough you sure you want me to go lay
[1:12:43] hands on him he's been persecuting us
[1:12:45] for 30
[1:12:46] years you know what God said he said go
[1:12:49] on down there he said you'll find a
[1:12:51] changed
[1:12:52] man you'll find a man that's blind can't
[1:12:55] see where he's going. He's probably been
[1:12:57] praying for three days cuz he was
[1:13:01] a praying person.
[1:13:04] He was a Pharisee of the Pharisees.
[1:13:07] Amen. He did all those things. He wasn't
[1:13:10] a ranked sinner. Sure. Sure, he was a
[1:13:11] sinner, but he wasn't a ranked sinner as
[1:13:13] far as, you know, a drunk or something.
[1:13:14] No, he was. He thought he was doing the
[1:13:16] work of God. That's right.
[1:13:20] You and I can't even give that. I knew I
[1:13:22] wasn't doing the work of God.
[1:13:25] Amen. Now maybe the children of wrath
[1:13:28] but not the work of God when I was a
[1:13:30] when I was not a Christian
[1:13:32] when I was a cucker. You know what? I
[1:13:34] acted like one cuz I look like one. I
[1:13:37] had the nature of a cucker inside of me.
[1:13:39] Hello somebody.
[1:13:41] So now that you have the nature of a
[1:13:43] wheat germ, you have changed.
[1:13:48] I'm saved. I'm walking in the grace of
[1:13:49] God. What does predestination look to
[1:13:54] destiny?
[1:13:55] All right. Now, watch. Where will he
[1:13:57] take me to? And where am I going? That's
[1:14:02] got you. There you are. God saw. And you
[1:14:06] know what? Now, by predestination that
[1:14:08] you and I can read this right here, and
[1:14:10] we know where we're going
[1:14:12] now. I don't know every little intricate
[1:14:15] detail of my future,
[1:14:20] but I know I got one and it's not of
[1:14:23] this world.
[1:14:25] You got one. It's not of this world. We
[1:14:27] don't know what's going to happen
[1:14:28] tomorrow, the next day. But we know, as
[1:14:31] we said
[1:14:32] before, everybody's wanting to preach on
[1:14:34] the pope, you know, coming out of the
[1:14:35] United States and want to all that's a
[1:14:38] sign. That's a signpost on the side of
[1:14:41] the road telling you, "Beware. Be
[1:14:43] careful. Watch the turns. Watch the
[1:14:45] four-way stop. Watch this." But it's not
[1:14:48] the car.
[1:14:50] It's not the car.
[1:14:53] This is the car.
[1:14:55] You're in the right car on the right
[1:14:57] road. There's just warning signs to tell
[1:14:59] you be careful.
[1:15:02] That sign's not going to get you to
[1:15:03] heaven. That sign's not going to get you
[1:15:06] to your destination. It will help you
[1:15:09] cuz signs follow believers. We
[1:15:11] understand that. But don't depend on all
[1:15:14] the I'm just going to say it. People
[1:15:17] have depended on for years. the things
[1:15:20] that Brother Brandham in the 50s and
[1:15:21] 60s, the things he prophesied, they're
[1:15:23] waiting on it to come to pass and then
[1:15:25] maybe they'll start
[1:15:27] believing. Come on, you know as well as
[1:15:29] I do. People are sign
[1:15:33] seekers. A wicked and a Jesus said this.
[1:15:36] He's the greatest preacher that ever
[1:15:37] was, right? Jesus said, "A
[1:15:41] wicked and perverse generation seeks
[1:15:44] after a sign."
[1:15:48] All we got to do is believe it. I
[1:15:50] believe when brother Brown said it in
[1:15:51] the 50s that there was going to pop come
[1:15:52] out of the United States. I didn't have
[1:15:54] to physically see it. But now that it's
[1:15:57] here, I know that's a sign that I'm
[1:15:59] getting closer to my destination.
[1:16:03] But I'm on the right road.
[1:16:06] That sign is not down a denominational
[1:16:08] road.
[1:16:12] It's not down a Presbyterian, Baptist,
[1:16:14] Methodist. It's not down there road cuz
[1:16:17] that road's not going to lead where this
[1:16:18] road leads. Oh, come on, somebody. We're
[1:16:21] on the right road. We got the right
[1:16:22] vehicle. We got the signs. We know where
[1:16:24] we're going. We don't have to
[1:16:26] absolutely. We don't have to say, "Oh,
[1:16:28] what's going to happen next?" We know
[1:16:30] what's going to happen next. Yes, sir.
[1:16:32] Amen. We know church and state's coming
[1:16:34] together.
[1:16:36] We know religion and and and politics
[1:16:38] are coming together. We know that. Yeah,
[1:16:42] we didn't know it had names on it
[1:16:46] of Leo and Trump and all the different
[1:16:47] ones.
[1:16:49] What about Pope Leo? Brother Bram said,
[1:16:52] "What? Comes in like a
[1:16:55] lamb, goes out like a lion, Leo." Now,
[1:16:59] see, we see those signs. So, we
[1:17:01] know by the
[1:17:03] sign that that's the right one.
[1:17:07] But just knowing that is not going to
[1:17:09] get us anywhere.
[1:17:12] Cuz remember, do you do you pull up to
[1:17:14] Come on. We're going to be heading out
[1:17:16] in just a little while. We're going to
[1:17:18] be running down a road and speed limit
[1:17:19] 70. We going to be running 70 miles an
[1:17:21] hour and all of a sudden it's going to
[1:17:22] say, "Here's an
[1:17:26] exit." No, I don't know. That's not my
[1:17:29] exit.
[1:17:32] I know I'm on the right road. I know
[1:17:35] what my exit is. I know how far I got to
[1:17:38] go. Yes, sir. Because of God's GPS,
[1:17:42] God's positioning system.
[1:17:46] God's predestinated seed
[1:17:49] knows where we're going to end up at.
[1:17:52] Amen. So, he
[1:17:54] punched he punched it in the GPS before
[1:17:56] the foundation of the world.
[1:17:59] Cuz he knew that's what we would choose.
[1:18:01] That road right there.
[1:18:04] The world says, "Okay, we got a pope
[1:18:05] from the United States. Big deal. So
[1:18:07] what? It means nothing to them, but
[1:18:09] thank God we had a prophet 60 years ago,
[1:18:13] 70 years ago tell us there was going to
[1:18:15] be a pope out of the United States."
[1:18:18] Did y'all realize, like I said before,
[1:18:19] listen, they bet on everything, right?
[1:18:24] I mean, they bet on everything out in
[1:18:26] Vegas.
[1:18:28] He only had a one point. Boy, if we
[1:18:30] could have bet. Oh, if we could have put
[1:18:32] a hundred. Some of y'all are
[1:18:38] smiling. How do y'all know what that
[1:18:42] is? If we could have put a 100 on that
[1:18:45] line, he had a 1.3% chance of becoming
[1:18:48] the pope according to Las Vegas.
[1:18:52] 1.3. And if you'd have won betting $100,
[1:18:55] you'd have been a
[1:18:57] multi-millionaire. Oh, you're right. But
[1:18:59] we knew that was what was going to
[1:19:02] happen.
[1:19:05] But folks, let me ask you a
[1:19:07] question. Did it make you study more or
[1:19:11] become a better Christian just because
[1:19:13] the Pope came out of the United States?
[1:19:16] If it did, then you're a sign seeker.
[1:19:22] I wasn't waiting on a pope to come out
[1:19:24] of the United States.
[1:19:26] I'm waiting on the coming of the Lord.
[1:19:28] Amen. That's right. But that is a sign
[1:19:31] that says, "Hey, beware. You're getting
[1:19:33] close to your destination.
[1:19:36] You're getting close. We're there. We
[1:19:38] see prophecy not just being prophesied.
[1:19:41] We see it walking on the street."
[1:19:44] Okay. So, that gives us the opportunity
[1:19:46] to dig a little more.
[1:19:49] To push a little more.
[1:19:52] Don't do this, but go a little faster
[1:19:55] on this highway we're on. Not the
[1:19:57] highway out
[1:20:00] there. But praise
[1:20:03] God, the church positionally before the
[1:20:07] foundation of the world. Before the
[1:20:09] foundation of the world, sorry. When God
[1:20:11] in his labor, now watch. When God in his
[1:20:14] labor pain was bringing
[1:20:17] forth bringing forth you.
[1:20:24] When he flung the stars off, he was
[1:20:26] thinking about you. Listen, when he
[1:20:28] flung the moon off, brother Danny, if we
[1:20:30] didn't have the moon, we wouldn't have
[1:20:31] tides. We wouldn't have seasons. We
[1:20:33] would have all He did that for us.
[1:20:36] He even saw the conveniences that we
[1:20:38] would have that he would give us. Come
[1:20:42] on. If he can see everything, he knew it
[1:20:44] all.
[1:20:46] So the church positionally before the
[1:20:48] foundation of the world when God in his
[1:20:50] labor pain was bringing forth bringing
[1:20:52] forth you watch knowing what you would
[1:20:56] do all right for knowledge
[1:21:00] cuz you weren't here when he thought it
[1:21:06] physically. There was an actual time
[1:21:08] when you had a birthday. Some of these
[1:21:09] people had birthdays you know when you
[1:21:10] was born.
[1:21:13] Okay. Knowing what you would
[1:21:19] do, he positionally placed
[1:21:22] you into his own body to be a housewife,
[1:21:27] to be a farmer, to be a preacher, to be
[1:21:30] a prophet, to be this or to be that. He
[1:21:33] placed you
[1:21:36] positionally. Then when we have come out
[1:21:38] of the garlands of Egypt. Now what is
[1:21:40] Egypt? Egypt types the world. Well,
[1:21:42] we've come out of the garlic lands of
[1:21:44] Egypt through sanctification. What?
[1:21:46] Through the wilderness journey, baptized
[1:21:48] into the promised
[1:21:50] land. For the promise of God is the Holy
[1:21:52] Ghost. We talked about that the other
[1:21:54] day. Ephesians 4:30. Grieve not the Holy
[1:21:56] Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed
[1:21:59] until the day of your redemption. When
[1:22:01] God having predestinated the church, now
[1:22:05] watch. He said, "And all the people,
[1:22:06] there will be millions times millions
[1:22:08] that'll walk very religious and be
[1:22:10] deceived." Amen. The only ones that will
[1:22:13] not be deceived will be those that have
[1:22:16] come over into the promised land. What?
[1:22:19] Baptism of the Holy
[1:22:21] Ghost. who before the foundation of the
[1:22:23] world had their names put on the lamb's
[1:22:25] book of life and has come over into the
[1:22:27] promised land and enjoying
[1:22:30] it. All right, everybody with
[1:22:34] me. Though many are called but few are
[1:22:37] chosen, the chosen was chosen at the
[1:22:40] beginning. Now, but we are predestinated
[1:22:42] to the adoption of the children of God
[1:22:46] by Jesus Christ. He's talking about
[1:22:48] placing a son today. The church has gone
[1:22:51] on for year after year after year. When
[1:22:54] we see God call a man out, one of his
[1:22:56] sons, and positionally places him and
[1:22:58] makes him his son and recognizes it
[1:23:00] before the public, we turn him
[1:23:03] down. Come on. He He put He put Jesus up
[1:23:07] on the Mount of Transfiguration. Right.
[1:23:09] Right.
[1:23:11] Here ye him. That was his adoption. Here
[1:23:13] ye him. Six months later, they hung him
[1:23:15] on a cross.
[1:23:20] Every time there's a God- called man
[1:23:21] comes on the scene, the devil gets
[1:23:24] involved and says, "Oh, he ain't nothing
[1:23:25] but this. He ain't that. He's got he's
[1:23:27] got these issues. He this he said this.
[1:23:29] It didn't come to pass. He did this.
[1:23:30] This when we going to not believe that
[1:23:33] anymore,
[1:23:36] believe God sent us somebody
[1:23:39] positionally places him, makes him his
[1:23:41] son, and recognizes it before the
[1:23:42] public. Then we turn that son down and
[1:23:45] say he's a divine healer or a holy
[1:23:46] ruler." Don't you see where the church?
[1:23:49] Oh, I don't know what the remedy is. I
[1:23:51] don't know how it'll ever get back to
[1:23:52] its place, but that's the way our
[1:23:54] attitudes are toward that person. If the
[1:23:57] if the ministry is of God, God will
[1:24:00] vindicate that ministry.
[1:24:04] If it isn't of God, then God will have
[1:24:06] nothing to do with it. That's what I put
[1:24:10] my confidence in.
[1:24:14] Read this and a couple more quotes.
[1:24:16] probably won't get to what we want to
[1:24:17] get to, but that's okay. How can you
[1:24:20] preach pred
[1:24:21] predestination for ordaining and setting
[1:24:24] or placing unless there's a sin
[1:24:26] atonement somewhere? See, all this to
[1:24:28] what we're talking about today, it all
[1:24:29] hinges on Calvary. It all hinges on
[1:24:32] somebody paying a price to bring us back
[1:24:34] to zero.
[1:24:36] Bring us back to where a clear slate.
[1:24:39] Everybody with me? It had to take a sin
[1:24:42] atonement to not just cover my sin, take
[1:24:44] them away.
[1:24:46] Amen. But if you're born again, man or
[1:24:48] woman, as soon as you make that mistake,
[1:24:51] God knows you're sorry for it.
[1:24:54] You can stand in the presence of
[1:24:56] President Roosevelt or anybody else, and
[1:24:58] say, "I'm wrong. God, forgive me for
[1:25:00] this thing." Why? That's where the blood
[1:25:02] atonement. You notice that sins, a
[1:25:04] sinner is a sinner. He does not commit
[1:25:08] sins. See, that's hard for some people
[1:25:11] to believe.
[1:25:13] A sinner only commits one
[1:25:16] sin, unbelief.
[1:25:19] Then he what? Manifest that unbelief by
[1:25:22] doing contrary to
[1:25:24] God. You and I are born again
[1:25:27] Christians. But we have sins in our
[1:25:30] spirit realm because we are still
[1:25:32] attached to that cuckar nature.
[1:25:36] Come on. The wheat just changed your
[1:25:38] soul. It didn't change your spirit
[1:25:40] realm. Amen. Greatest battle ever
[1:25:43] fought, not in your soul.
[1:25:46] Brother Ram said it was in your mind.
[1:25:48] Well, who's got access? Satan's got
[1:25:50] access. God's got
[1:25:52] access. Now watch though. But the church
[1:25:55] commits sin, does wrong, gets a wrong
[1:25:58] thought, wrong impression, makes
[1:26:00] scruples, wobbles like a little child
[1:26:02] walking, trying to learn how to walk. He
[1:26:05] just don't know how to walk good yet cuz
[1:26:07] he's a little boy.
[1:26:09] But we have a hand that reaches down.
[1:26:11] Praise God. Gets us and steadies us and
[1:26:14] says, "Make this step. Hold. Look at me.
[1:26:18] Make this step this way, son.
[1:26:21] Make this step this way, son."
[1:26:26] He doesn't pick us up and spank us
[1:26:28] because we make a mistake.
[1:26:31] He doesn't beat us to death because
[1:26:33] we're trying to walk.
[1:26:35] He loves us like we love our children. A
[1:26:38] real real daddy wouldn't whip his child
[1:26:41] when he's trying to walk. If he falls
[1:26:42] down on the floor, reach right down with
[1:26:44] a big strong hand and pick him up. Take
[1:26:47] both hands a hold of him. I can I can
[1:26:49] see God do that to
[1:26:51] us. Take those hands of
[1:26:53] grace and stand us up. Now, hold on a
[1:26:56] minute, though.
[1:26:58] If he's still standing you up and you're
[1:27:00] about 30 years in the
[1:27:02] gospel, he's fixing to turn you over his
[1:27:05] knee and do what he said he was going to
[1:27:07] do. That he was going to correct you.
[1:27:11] Amen. Amen.
[1:27:14] So there's stages. We all go through the
[1:27:16] stages. Reach right down with a big
[1:27:18] strong hand, pick him up, take both
[1:27:20] hands a hold of him, said, "This is the
[1:27:22] way you do it,
[1:27:23] son. Walk like this."
[1:27:26] That's the way God does his church. He
[1:27:28] reaches down and gets him in his arm,
[1:27:30] picks him up and says, "Walk like this,
[1:27:33] son. Here, don't don't say it like
[1:27:36] that. Talk it like this." Now, I don't
[1:27:39] care what the church says, what this
[1:27:41] says, what that says. You say it like
[1:27:43] this. Like this. Well, he's pointing to
[1:27:45] the Bible, I believe. Like this. Say it
[1:27:46] like
[1:27:47] this. My word preaches it. You stay
[1:27:50] right with it. Walk with it. All right.
[1:27:53] Walk with it.
[1:27:57] Stay right with it. Don't care what
[1:27:59] everybody else says.
[1:28:02] Stay right with it. Walk like this. This
[1:28:04] is the way you make your steps. This is
[1:28:07] the way you make your
[1:28:10] steps. Now,
[1:28:12] God, he was our savior. And we was
[1:28:15] talking about this the other day. I'm
[1:28:16] going to cover this just for a second.
[1:28:18] We accept him as our personal savior.
[1:28:20] Right?
[1:28:21] All right. Is everybody with me?
[1:28:25] And he nurtures us like little
[1:28:27] children. But now remember, he wants us
[1:28:30] to be a bride.
[1:28:33] He wants us to be a wife actually.
[1:28:36] And the wife knows exactly what the
[1:28:38] husband
[1:28:40] does. Now, praise God. It's not like all
[1:28:43] of us. Our spouses know what we are and
[1:28:45] how we act. Sister Alicia and like
[1:28:48] brother John, well, you might have to be
[1:28:49] with him for a couple months.
[1:28:52] So anyway, close together. You'll enjoy
[1:28:55] it. I know you
[1:28:56] will. But we've got to become a bride.
[1:29:00] Sure, he's our savior. Sure, he saved
[1:29:01] our soul. But we can't keep saying God
[1:29:04] saved our soul and sit down in a chair
[1:29:05] and just put a big lock around you and
[1:29:07] say, "I'm
[1:29:09] saved." If you got something inside of
[1:29:11] you, it's to it's to grow. It's
[1:29:14] something to grow.
[1:29:18] You may start that way. That's okay.
[1:29:20] Pick the child. Pick the child up. Sit
[1:29:21] it right here. Walk down through the
[1:29:22] aisle. Fall over. Pick him up. Walk down
[1:29:24] through the aisle. Fall over. But now
[1:29:25] when that kid's 30 years old, you ain't
[1:29:27] going to be over going here, son. It's
[1:29:30] been 30 years. I got some patience here.
[1:29:33] But you know, and he walks up to him,
[1:29:34] falls
[1:29:35] over. You laugh, but that's that's the
[1:29:38] same way with God. He don't want you to
[1:29:39] stay a baby. And you know what? He's not
[1:29:42] going to help you up
[1:29:45] at 30 years old.
[1:29:48] Oh, brother. No, he's going to let you
[1:29:51] suffer a little bit.
[1:29:55] But the tender hand of Jehovah knows
[1:29:57] exactly what to do with every one of us.
[1:30:00] All of our decisions we make, everything
[1:30:03] should be seasoned with God first
[1:30:07] because he's our bridegroom. Think of
[1:30:09] it. it. I think of
[1:30:12] God. Everything I think of
[1:30:15] God folds
[1:30:17] around how my personal experience is.
[1:30:21] Let me explain that. I once was a child.
[1:30:25] I was birthed by
[1:30:27] mom. All right? I needed help. I needed
[1:30:32] diapers. I needed somebody to feed me.
[1:30:36] Okay? So when you're a newborn babe in
[1:30:40] Christ, that's the same thing.
[1:30:44] The tender hand of God says, "I know
[1:30:46] you're a baby. I don't expect any more
[1:30:49] from you at this point." Amen.
[1:30:54] But get on up to 10 years old, 12 years
[1:30:57] old, 14 years
[1:31:01] old. Not anymore, son. What
[1:31:06] changed your
[1:31:09] position? You're not a baby
[1:31:12] anymore. Have you ever done something
[1:31:15] and and you know you your dad's helped
[1:31:18] you do this or your mama's helped you do
[1:31:20] this and then all of a sudden when you
[1:31:21] get to a certain age they're
[1:31:23] like I ain't helping you no more.
[1:31:28] Or or as my dad always say, "This one's
[1:31:30] on
[1:31:31] you. This one's on you." you know, we've
[1:31:34] come to I've helped you this far, but
[1:31:35] this one's on you, okay? You've you've
[1:31:38] used your you've used your last um pass
[1:31:41] card. Well, that's the way God is.
[1:31:45] Him being a perfect father, you come up
[1:31:47] to a certain place and you start acting
[1:31:49] this way. He knows you're going to start
[1:31:50] acting that way. So, he's standing right
[1:31:52] there
[1:31:53] and he gives you the formula of how to
[1:31:56] get through it and buy it.
[1:32:00] But we still go bye.
[1:32:07] As brother Brown said, there's something
[1:32:08] mentally wrong with you
[1:32:10] then. That's the same way in the
[1:32:12] gospel. There's people that decide to
[1:32:15] stay babies. Even though being born in
[1:32:18] the family, they decide to stay
[1:32:21] babies. I want to know my
[1:32:26] savior as my bridegroom.
[1:32:30] As a savior, you get something, but as a
[1:32:33] bridegroom, you get something else.
[1:32:38] As a fully mature
[1:32:40] wife, you get something else.
[1:32:44] That's where I want to be. I want
[1:32:46] something else from God.
[1:32:50] I'm not
[1:32:51] satisfied where I'm at. You shouldn't be
[1:32:54] satisfied with where you're at.
[1:32:57] It's wonderful to have a savior. It's
[1:32:59] wonderful to be young and and come to
[1:33:02] church and man, everything is good and
[1:33:05] and then, you know, 10 years later, you
[1:33:08] know, you've been through the hardships
[1:33:09] of life and and you wonder where God
[1:33:13] went. He's child training
[1:33:16] you. He's training you to be an adult.
[1:33:22] Amen.
[1:33:24] And when God trains you to be an adult,
[1:33:26] he knows exactly what to say in every
[1:33:27] situation you're in.
[1:33:30] I can miss it. Brother Donnie can miss
[1:33:32] all of us parents. We do try to do the
[1:33:33] best we can, but we're human beings.
[1:33:36] We want something to turn out this way
[1:33:38] and this way and this way and this way.
[1:33:40] But kid may have a different
[1:33:44] attitude. Well, see, we do too. But God
[1:33:47] knows though that he'll take you through
[1:33:48] when he when he when he finds you over
[1:33:50] here on the other end of that problem
[1:33:52] you're in. He's standing there waiting
[1:33:54] on you. Sometimes we want to just, you
[1:33:55] know, keep kicking on him. But I want to
[1:33:58] be I want to know my savior as my
[1:34:02] bridegroom
[1:34:06] cuz let me just be plain. As my
[1:34:09] savior, he gives me everything I need.
[1:34:12] All right? But when he comes over here,
[1:34:15] it's an intimate relationship.
[1:34:18] A bride and a bridegroom is an intimate
[1:34:20] relationship that you enter into that
[1:34:23] you only know each other. You start
[1:34:25] knowing each other's desires and wants
[1:34:28] and all those. That's what I
[1:34:30] want. I don't want him to treat me like
[1:34:32] a kid. I want him to treat me like a an
[1:34:35] adult, a bride. Bridegroom, bride,
[1:34:37] bride, groom. Everybody with me? That's
[1:34:40] what I want and that's what you should
[1:34:42] want.
[1:34:44] Thank God he saved our soul.
[1:34:46] Amen. But remember one thing, Christ is
[1:34:50] never going to get back on the cross to
[1:34:52] save you again.
[1:34:55] Amen. The Bible tells us, see, let's go
[1:34:57] to scripture now. The Bible tells us he
[1:35:00] died once for all. Amen. Once for all.
[1:35:08] So you don't have to go back to the foot
[1:35:09] of Calvary and look and see a man on
[1:35:12] Calvary. Come on, somebody. We see an
[1:35:15] empty cross just like we see an empty
[1:35:18] tomb
[1:35:20] as a lot of people, you know, a lot of
[1:35:22] um I think brother Ram even said it that
[1:35:24] they can't get Christ off the off the
[1:35:26] cross. Oh yeah, he died for me and he's
[1:35:28] my
[1:35:29] savior. But I want that man to get
[1:35:32] inside of me.
[1:35:35] I want to get to know him more. You know
[1:35:38] why? You know, all right, let's be plain
[1:35:40] just for a second, then we'll close.
[1:35:42] Sister Jun and I have been married 46
[1:35:44] years coming up in
[1:35:46] October. Now, when we first got
[1:35:49] married, it was a love
[1:35:53] affair, but it had its
[1:35:56] problems cuz I didn't fully know, you
[1:35:59] know, when you met him on Saturday night
[1:36:01] or or Friday or spent a little time with
[1:36:04] him, Brother John, you went back home.
[1:36:11] Now you're stuck with
[1:36:15] them. Maybe it'll wake us up a little
[1:36:17] bit, but now you're stuck with
[1:36:20] them. And like I said before, you know,
[1:36:23] when little John, that's what I'd look
[1:36:26] like going on a
[1:36:29] date. The man's got
[1:36:33] some
[1:36:34] pizzazz. Okay. But you know what though?
[1:36:38] You you get married and I hope God gives
[1:36:40] you a wonderful wife, but you ain't
[1:36:43] going to look like that all
[1:36:49] time. Sorry, dude. And your wife's not
[1:36:54] either. You going to wake up one day and
[1:36:56] you're going to
[1:37:00] go. Why? Because you become more
[1:37:02] intimate. What I'm trying to say is
[1:37:04] that's human beings. That's two lives
[1:37:07] being brought together.
[1:37:10] But remember, they're both imperfect.
[1:37:14] Amen.
[1:37:17] But when we enter into a relationship
[1:37:19] with Jesus Christ,
[1:37:22] he's perfect.
[1:37:25] We're
[1:37:26] not. But he looks at us like we are.
[1:37:33] Even though we have messy hair. Oh,
[1:37:35] morning breath.
[1:37:37] Oh, not it's okay, baby. I'm leaving
[1:37:41] soon as it's over with and I'm going to
[1:37:43] Kentucky.
[1:37:45] So, but do you understand what I'm
[1:37:48] saying? Because uh when you try to just
[1:37:50] get try to know somebody, it's two
[1:37:52] imperfect people trying to get to know
[1:37:55] each other. And that mean you live with
[1:37:57] them when they smell good and bad. their
[1:38:00] hair's fixed and
[1:38:02] not the clothes are all man. You don't
[1:38:05] go out on a date looking like you just
[1:38:06] got
[1:38:07] up. But when your wife wants you to do
[1:38:10] something in the morning, you get up
[1:38:11] like you just woke up.
[1:38:15] But you know what? She loves me anyway.
[1:38:18] Praise
[1:38:20] God. God loves me anyway.
[1:38:24] Cuz what does he look at? He's looking
[1:38:26] at your heart. He's looking at your
[1:38:29] heart. He's not worried about your
[1:38:31] flesh. Come on, somebody. He's worried
[1:38:34] about your heart. He wants your heart.
[1:38:37] And heart is where the love is. And
[1:38:39] that's why we've been married 46 years.
[1:38:41] We've been through some rough times.
[1:38:43] Good times, bad
[1:38:50] times. Her sister died the other day.
[1:38:52] And when people die, you always get out
[1:38:55] the old pictures.
[1:38:57] So, we got out the
[1:39:00] easy. They're
[1:39:04] they're not as old as her mother
[1:39:07] pictures. Some of them pictures
[1:39:10] are dark colored, you know, black and
[1:39:13] white, you know, didn't have no color.
[1:39:15] They were in the 40s and the 30s, 20s of
[1:39:18] her mother when she was a young
[1:39:20] lady. But then she started pulling out
[1:39:22] the pictures of her
[1:39:27] When I
[1:39:28] remember when we first started
[1:39:31] dating, I got
[1:39:33] excited all over
[1:39:36] again. You know why? Cuz I love
[1:39:40] her. I love
[1:39:45] her. I don't care if her if her if her
[1:39:48] eyes are baggy now.
[1:39:52] We can fix that. If not,
[1:39:59] I'm
[1:40:01] trying. I'm trying. I'm trying to do
[1:40:04] this so I can get out that
[1:40:07] way. But come on. Is that the way with
[1:40:10] God? He He's just He wants to have an
[1:40:12] intimate relationship with you, but he's
[1:40:13] not going to pick you apart.
[1:40:16] I hope you see that. He's not going to
[1:40:18] pick you
[1:40:18] apart. He's going to say, "Hey, I love
[1:40:21] you.
[1:40:23] I give you something to look at. I don't
[1:40:27] care. I don't care that the inadequacies
[1:40:30] that we have. He does not care. If
[1:40:34] you're born again of the spirit of God
[1:40:35] and you have God inside your soul,
[1:40:38] you're just as eternal as God is. You're
[1:40:40] that 18-year-old girl that we were
[1:40:42] looking at the pictures of. And I'm
[1:40:43] like, "Oh man,
[1:40:46] wow." Well, you know what? If I can do
[1:40:50] that in my finite
[1:40:52] mind, I'm closed. Come on, musicians. If
[1:40:55] I can do that in my finite
[1:40:59] mind, what can God
[1:41:01] do with an infinite
[1:41:04] mind? Yeah, we're going to sing a song
[1:41:06] though before we take communion. Come
[1:41:08] on, let's I think we need to we need to
[1:41:10] sing a song before we then we'll take
[1:41:12] communion. Not just rush right
[1:41:16] in. But what about a God that knows
[1:41:23] everything? Does not look at our
[1:41:27] inadequacies. He says, "You're my
[1:41:30] bride. I will have no
[1:41:32] other. There's no one else I'm looking
[1:41:35] at. There's no one else I
[1:41:39] want. There's people going to be given
[1:41:41] eternal life."
[1:41:43] Absolutely. Okay.
[1:41:45] There's going to be a foolish virgin.
[1:41:47] There's going to be people that give
[1:41:49] eternal life for being good to you. But
[1:41:51] you know
[1:41:52] what? You're his bride. So, you're
[1:41:55] connected to him. They're not connected
[1:41:58] to him. They don't go home with him. Oh,
[1:42:02] come on,
[1:42:03] somebody. They don't go to the future
[1:42:05] home with Jesus Christ. They'll have to
[1:42:08] live. Sure, they'll get eternal life.
[1:42:10] Sure, they may live outside the city.
[1:42:12] But you are the one God's looking for.
[1:42:14] You are the one God's looking at. You're
[1:42:17] the one that he's building a city by
[1:42:19] your
[1:42:21] desire. He wrote this by your
[1:42:24] desire because this is his will and we
[1:42:27] can we know, listen, we need
[1:42:30] healing. God knew we need healing. He
[1:42:34] put it in the
[1:42:35] atonement. God knew we need salvation.
[1:42:37] He put in the atonement. But he also
[1:42:40] knew that we would come to a place to
[1:42:42] where, and I was trying to get to today,
[1:42:44] but maybe next week or so, where now he
[1:42:47] gives us a
[1:42:49] checkbook that doesn't have his name on
[1:42:54] it. Now, here we go again. When June and
[1:42:59] I first got
[1:43:00] married, I did all the checkbook. I did
[1:43:02] all that cuz I was the, you know, the I
[1:43:06] was the entrepreneur.
[1:43:08] I knew the three boxes in, out, and
[1:43:10] what's left over, you know. Well, June
[1:43:12] missed one of those one time. I let her
[1:43:14] try to do the And she still does them
[1:43:17] now. And let me just give you a word of
[1:43:19] advice. You don't know what's going to
[1:43:21] happen tomorrow. Don't keep secrets from
[1:43:24] your wife. Don't keep secrets from your
[1:43:27] husband. I know some of you think you
[1:43:29] got your money and she's got hers, but I
[1:43:31] think that's absolutely pathetic.
[1:43:35] pathetic that you have to do that. This
[1:43:38] is mine. You can't have mine. This is
[1:43:39] mine. I I I worked for this. You two are
[1:43:42] one is what the Bible
[1:43:44] says. The Bible says you two are one,
[1:43:49] not my
[1:43:50] opinion. Well, this is my money. I'll
[1:43:52] spend any way I want to. That's garbage.
[1:43:55] I hope you never say that in front of
[1:43:57] me cuz I got an issue with that. But
[1:44:00] there was a time though. I let her
[1:44:02] handle the checkbook. Well, she forgot
[1:44:04] one of them three boxes and we had some
[1:44:09] overdrafts and there's fees included in
[1:44:12] that. I didn't divorce
[1:44:16] her. Some might
[1:44:20] have. That's probably the only two bad
[1:44:23] checks we ever had in our life. Ain't
[1:44:25] that right during that
[1:44:27] season? Okay. She may know more. I'm
[1:44:30] trying to make this a little bit easier
[1:44:31] here.
[1:44:34] But remember, this is my this is my
[1:44:37] whole point. I didn't say, "Well, bless
[1:44:38] God, you can't do this no more. I'm
[1:44:40] going to sign all the checks. You just
[1:44:42] write it to who it needs to go
[1:44:44] to." No, she still has the check. I I
[1:44:48] probably hadn't written a check in
[1:44:49] forever. Of course, we don't now in this
[1:44:52] day and age, but we do try to do some.
[1:44:54] But her name now is as good on the
[1:44:57] checkbook as mine.
[1:45:00] I don't have to sign Wade Dale and hand
[1:45:01] her all the check, you know, sign. Well,
[1:45:03] bless God here. You got to this is, you
[1:45:05] know, no, I give her a blank checkbook.
[1:45:08] Checks need to be written. She writes a
[1:45:09] check. That's the same way God is. Let's
[1:45:10] stand to our feet. That's the same way
[1:45:12] God is. He comes to trust
[1:45:14] you. Listen, with his economy,
[1:45:19] with his econ, God has an economy.
[1:45:24] You know, you know God has governments.
[1:45:27] The Bible says the government will be on
[1:45:29] his shoulder. There's going to be
[1:45:30] governance in the even in the
[1:45:32] millennium, even in the new home,
[1:45:33] there's going to be kings. Well, if
[1:45:34] there's a king, got to have something to
[1:45:35] rule over. Everybody with
[1:45:38] me? So, he set up his kingdom though
[1:45:41] perfect. We just got
[1:45:43] to mesh into that. But he knows though
[1:45:47] that we weren't born as a baby and we
[1:45:51] automatically got a checkbook. No, he
[1:45:53] gives us a check. He says, "I'm signing
[1:45:56] this. You write it. You write whatever
[1:45:58] you need. Healing, salvation, every you
[1:46:00] write. I've signed it. You fill it out
[1:46:03] and hand it to God. But there's going to
[1:46:06] be a time in the end time. I'm talking
[1:46:08] about close now where you're going to
[1:46:10] probably need, come on, a physical check
[1:46:13] that ain't got no money in the
[1:46:16] bank." And you have a
[1:46:19] need. How many of us have seen God work
[1:46:21] in our even in our finances? Oh, look.
[1:46:24] all over. I mean, worked in our
[1:46:26] finances. He is so Listen, he cares
[1:46:30] about
[1:46:31] you. He cares about you. So, he cares
[1:46:34] about every little aspect in your life.
[1:46:37] But there's a time though when we come
[1:46:38] into that spiritual realm to where he's
[1:46:40] going to give us the checkbook and he's
[1:46:42] going to say, "Whatever you want, you
[1:46:46] sign it when you need it." If you say to
[1:46:49] this mountain, he didn't say if you ask
[1:46:51] your pastor, he didn't say if you ask
[1:46:53] this. He said, if you say to this
[1:46:55] mountain, be moved and doubt not in your
[1:46:58] heart, what you signed a check. Move the
[1:47:03] mountain and a
[1:47:07] maringa. And you know what? God, brother
[1:47:10] said, God will take it. He said, can't
[1:47:13] bankrupt heaven. We got plenty of money
[1:47:14] for
[1:47:16] that. So don't worry about it. Doesn't
[1:47:18] matter how many you write. But listen,
[1:47:20] if you were a baby though and you
[1:47:21] started writing checks, you'd have some
[1:47:24] overdraft. But when you're a fully
[1:47:26] matured bride, you know what he wants.
[1:47:30] You know what he wants done with the
[1:47:31] word and you know what he wants even in
[1:47:33] your home personal life. Put God first.
[1:47:38] And we're going to come to this adoption
[1:47:39] to where our name is as good on a check
[1:47:42] as who? Jesus
[1:47:44] Christ. Let's sing a song. God bless
[1:47:46] you.
[1:47:54] Oh, count the
[1:47:56] cost. Take up your
[1:47:59] cross. Follow him. Sing it to him one
[1:48:02] more
[1:48:03] time. Oh, just take up your
[1:48:09] cross and follow Jesus.
[1:48:13] [Music]
[1:48:15] Take up your
[1:48:16] [Music]
[1:48:20] cross every day.
[1:48:26] What? Don't be
[1:48:28] ashamed of your
[1:48:31] bridegroom. You know
[1:48:34] him. We'll count the
[1:48:38] cost. Take up your cross and follow him.
[1:48:43] If you'll get ready for the communion,
[1:48:44] we'll start right here. Oh, just take up
[1:48:47] your
[1:48:50] cross and follow
[1:48:55] Jesus. Oh, take up your
[1:49:00] cross. Do it every day.
[1:49:04] Oh, it's a continual walk with God.
[1:49:07] Oh, don't be ashamed
[1:49:12] to say that you know
[1:49:16] him. Oh, count the cross. Take up your
[1:49:21] cross and follow him.
[1:49:25] Amen. Take up your cross and follow
[1:49:28] Jesus. You can be seated. We'll we'll go
[1:49:31] right into the communion.
[1:49:33] I just love that uh that we're
[1:49:37] all in a place that we can take
[1:49:40] communion.
[1:49:44] Yes. Yes. We'll do that right before we
[1:49:46] do um footwashing when we separate.
[1:49:49] Yeah. We'll pray over Brother John.
[1:49:50] We'll we'll pray when when we take
[1:49:53] footashing here before they go
[1:49:55] downstairs. We'll pray over the family
[1:49:57] and and give you a couple prayer cloths.
[1:49:59] Yes. But let's do this. Let's get the
[1:50:01] communion part
[1:50:03] going. Communion 1 Corinthians
[1:50:06] 11:23 or 34. Thank you so much for for
[1:50:10] being uh patient today. I didn't even
[1:50:12] get to what I wanted to get to, but
[1:50:13] that's okay. I think we did enough. We
[1:50:17] we just we
[1:50:18] just Paul told a group of people, he
[1:50:21] said, "Don't be babies
[1:50:24] anymore." He said, "I know you desire
[1:50:26] the sincere milk of the word. I know you
[1:50:28] were a baby." He said, "But now strong
[1:50:30] meat belongs to those who are of full
[1:50:35] age." So let's take communion. For I've
[1:50:37] received of the Lord that which also I
[1:50:38] delivered unto you. That the Lord Jesus
[1:50:40] the same night in which he was betrayed
[1:50:42] took bread. And when he had given
[1:50:44] thanks, he broke it and said, "Take,
[1:50:45] eat. This is my body which is broken for
[1:50:47] you. This do in remembrance of me."
[1:50:50] After the same manner also he took the
[1:50:52] cup, and when he had sucked, saying,
[1:50:53] "This cup is the New
[1:50:55] Testament." New Testament. Amen. He's
[1:50:58] going to die to release that life to
[1:51:01] create a new testament. Amen. New
[1:51:03] testament in my blood. This do you as
[1:51:05] often as you drink it in remembrance of
[1:51:06] me. For as often as you eat this bread
[1:51:08] and drink this cup, you do show the
[1:51:10] Lord's death till he comes. Wherefore
[1:51:13] whosoever shall eat of this bread and
[1:51:14] drink this cup of the Lord unworthily
[1:51:17] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[1:51:19] the Lord. But let a man examine
[1:51:21] himself, examine yourself, and so let
[1:51:24] him eat of that bread and drink of that
[1:51:26] cup. For he that eateth and drinkkeeth
[1:51:28] unworthily eateth and drinkketh
[1:51:29] damnation to himself, not discerning the
[1:51:32] Lord's body. For this cause many are
[1:51:34] weak and sickly among you, many sleep.
[1:51:36] For if we would judge ourselves, we
[1:51:38] should not be judged. But when we are
[1:51:40] judged, we are chasened to the Lord that
[1:51:41] we should not be condemned with the
[1:51:44] world. Wherefore, my brethren, when you
[1:51:46] come together to eat, tar one for
[1:51:48] another, and if any man hunger, let him
[1:51:49] eat at home, that you come not together
[1:51:51] into condemnation. And Paul said, the
[1:51:53] rest I'll set in order when I come.
[1:51:56] Let's take a few moments or seconds of
[1:51:59] of silent prayer. Clean the slate.
[1:52:02] Listen, you're never going to in your
[1:52:04] mind, you're never going to be worthy to
[1:52:07] take communion in your mind because your
[1:52:10] mind is going to say you did this.
[1:52:12] Brother Brown said, "Clean it
[1:52:16] up." Everybody with me? Clean it up. And
[1:52:20] if you can't clean it up right now, tell
[1:52:23] God, "I'm gonna take communion, but you
[1:52:25] better go make it
[1:52:26] right." We've got to quit. Listen, if
[1:52:29] you're a Christian, you'll you'll want
[1:52:30] to take
[1:52:31] communion. There's not a time that I
[1:52:34] have not. Now, there's times that if I
[1:52:36] judged
[1:52:38] myself, I judge myself
[1:52:41] unworthy, but I look at the body and
[1:52:44] blood of the Lord and sincerely ask him
[1:52:47] to forgive
[1:52:48] me. And the Bible says he's he's he's a
[1:52:51] good steward. He's willing to do that.
[1:52:52] But you got to ask him. And he knows
[1:52:54] your heart. He knows whether you do or
[1:52:56] not. So let's take a moment of of silent
[1:52:58] prayer and just ask God to clean your
[1:53:01] slate. Let's check up. Today is a
[1:53:03] checkup day where everything comes back
[1:53:04] to zero. Everything comes back to slate
[1:53:06] is clean. Everything's white.
[1:53:08] Everything's pure. Right now, let's bow
[1:53:11] our heads.
[1:53:21] Lord, may your blessings fall upon each
[1:53:23] person in this building. In Jesus name
[1:53:25] we pray. Amen. Bible said he took bread
[1:53:29] and blessed it. Dear heavenly father,
[1:53:30] Lord, thank you for this bread. It's
[1:53:32] been made with holy hands the way it
[1:53:34] should be prepared. Lord, I pray that
[1:53:35] you would Lord sanctify it. Lord, it'll
[1:53:38] nourish our bodies and Lord be with us
[1:53:39] as the body of Christ comes together and
[1:53:41] partakes us in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:53:51] You know, the Bible there says not be
[1:53:53] condemned with the world. Do you know if
[1:53:55] you're if you're in Christ, you can't be
[1:53:56] condemned with the
[1:53:58] world. You've been called out. And when
[1:54:01] you've been called out, this world is
[1:54:03] going to, you know, we like I said
[1:54:05] before, we're some people I
[1:54:10] hope because I had the same thought.
[1:54:12] Listen, I had the same thought when I
[1:54:14] was growing up. I said, "When California
[1:54:16] sinks, I'll start going to church."
[1:54:18] Hello,
[1:54:19] somebody. H Well, when this happens, you
[1:54:23] know, I believe that Brother Brandon was
[1:54:25] a prophet and I believe his prophecy,
[1:54:27] but I ain't going to church. Well,
[1:54:29] that's just
[1:54:33] stupid. I don't know how any other way
[1:54:35] to say that because I was one that did
[1:54:36] it. And I can call myself stupid if I
[1:54:38] want to.
[1:54:42] Not
[1:54:43] y'all. God can. But that was I mean, if
[1:54:46] we're waiting on
[1:54:47] that, it's like the people hanging
[1:54:49] around the ark. Let's don't hang around
[1:54:51] the ark. Let's get in the ark. There's
[1:54:55] time to get in and sit down. Then God's
[1:54:57] going to shut the door. Dear heavenly
[1:55:00] father, Lord, I pray that you'd sanctify
[1:55:02] this wine, Lord, and the partakers.
[1:55:04] Father, let us remember as we hold this
[1:55:05] cup and Lord, we hold the bread in our
[1:55:08] hands, Father, that one day, Hallelujah,
[1:55:11] one day you did die at Calvary, that
[1:55:13] literal body of yours achd and pained
[1:55:15] for hours hanging on that cross just so
[1:55:18] that we can have freedom. That we can
[1:55:20] have joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[1:55:23] Let us remember just for this one
[1:55:24] moment, Lord, that that happened for me
[1:55:27] and each person says it happened for me.
[1:55:31] Father, just sanctify us now in Jesus
[1:55:33] name.
[1:55:36] Amen. You know, sometimes we have to do
[1:55:38] that. We have to we have to
[1:55:42] reset. We're human
[1:55:47] beings. I
[1:55:49] mean, what about a
[1:55:52] relationship? Think about this. As I was
[1:55:55] talking about me and June, we had a
[1:55:56] relationship where we had to say I'm
[1:55:58] sorry a
[1:55:59] lot, each of us, back and forth. But
[1:56:02] when you're in a relationship with Jesus
[1:56:04] Christ, there ain't but one person
[1:56:05] that's got to say, "I'm sorry."
[1:56:10] Cuz I realize my husband is perfect.
[1:56:15] Hello.
[1:56:16] I realize I realize I in my humanity am
[1:56:20] not,
[1:56:22] but Christ is. And if he's our
[1:56:26] bridegroom, brother Dy, he never has to
[1:56:29] say, "Oh, honey, I'm sorry I treated you
[1:56:31] that way." See, what a consolation we
[1:56:34] have. We have fights and troubles here
[1:56:35] because it's two. But when we rest in
[1:56:38] one, he's perfect. And we're trying our
[1:56:40] best to get attached to
[1:56:43] that, man. That makes the load a lot
[1:56:46] lighter. That's why he said, "Put
[1:56:47] everything on me. I'll take
[1:56:50] it. husband, I can't do this. He said,
[1:56:53] "Don't worry. I took care of it before
[1:56:55] the foundation of the world. It's all
[1:56:58] it's already over. I just wanted you to
[1:56:59] I just want you to realize
[1:57:01] it." See, that's a relationship. That's,
[1:57:04] as Brother Ryan says, that's a
[1:57:06] revelation. When you get a revelation of
[1:57:08] that, that's a
[1:57:11] revelation. Because you know what? Satan
[1:57:14] can't get a
[1:57:15] revelation. So, he can't have a
[1:57:18] revelation with Christ. But you and I
[1:57:21] can. You say, "Oh, the devil does this
[1:57:23] and the devil does that." There's one
[1:57:25] thing he can't
[1:57:27] do. He cannot get a revelation
[1:57:31] like I can.
[1:57:34] I can get a revelation and he has
[1:57:36] nothing nothing to do with it. He can
[1:57:40] beat you because remember what he say to
[1:57:42] Job.
[1:57:44] God said, "Have you considered my
[1:57:45] servant Job?" And first thing, so Satan
[1:57:48] was there sometime around Job because he
[1:57:50] said, "Uh, you got a hedge around him.
[1:57:52] Every time I try to do something, he's
[1:57:53] like, you know, you've got Michael the
[1:57:55] Archangel standing there, you know, and
[1:57:56] I can't do
[1:57:57] anything."
[1:58:00] Right? I said, "Well, that's okay. I'm
[1:58:02] going to show you that it ain't always
[1:58:03] the archangel that's got all the that's
[1:58:05] got all the power." I said, "Um, come
[1:58:06] over here, Michael, and stand here now.
[1:58:08] Go for it.
[1:58:10] you're going to see that that's my
[1:58:12] man. Job went through all the problems,
[1:58:15] but that was God's man. Or he would not
[1:58:17] have said, "Have you
[1:58:19] considered my servant, Job?" Amen. Have
[1:58:24] you
[1:58:25] considered my servant? He didn't say he
[1:58:29] didn't say I'm considering your servant,
[1:58:31] devil. He served you. No, he said, "Have
[1:58:33] you considered my servant Job?" Oh,
[1:58:35] yeah. You got a hedge around him. you
[1:58:37] you've you've uh you you got all kind of
[1:58:39] stuff, you know. You got a big tall
[1:58:41] tower and all kind of thick rock and all
[1:58:44] that stuff. I can't get to him. He said,
[1:58:48] "Okay, I'm going to I'm going to get rid
[1:58:50] of that and I'm going to show you that
[1:58:52] that's what's not
[1:58:53] keeping Job
[1:58:58] righteous. That's protecting Job. The
[1:59:01] righteousness comes from you and me. We
[1:59:04] are the righteous ones.
[1:59:07] by
[1:59:09] Christ, not ourselves, but by
[1:59:13] Christ. Because remember, Paul said,
[1:59:16] "It's not my own righteousness, but it's
[1:59:18] the righteousness of Jesus Christ." But
[1:59:21] now, who does he give it
[1:59:22] to? Who does he give that righteousness
[1:59:25] to? Me, you. He gives that to me and
[1:59:32] you. And I believe it's been said many
[1:59:35] times before, we are living below our
[1:59:37] privileges. Our husband wants to treat
[1:59:40] us perfect. We just got to let him do
[1:59:43] it. Let's
[1:59:46] take Thank you,
[1:59:54] Lord. as they're taking this up. Brother
[1:59:57] John, sister Alicia,
[2:00:00] kids, I'm sorry, young adults.
[2:00:24] All
[2:00:35] right. You leave him here with him.
[2:00:41] Yeah. All right. We're about finished
[2:00:43] here. We We're going to pray uh you pray
[2:00:47] uh with us that Brother John. Now, he's
[2:00:48] going to be in Australia, but he's found
[2:00:50] a church there that he can go to. I like
[2:00:52] that.
[2:00:54] I like that. You know, we do the same
[2:00:56] thing. We try our best to find a church
[2:00:57] close by. We just don't want to not go
[2:00:59] to church and he doesn't either. So,
[2:01:01] he's found him a place in Australia
[2:01:02] that's a good message believer. And
[2:01:04] then, of course, he'll be with brother
[2:01:06] Vernon in the Philippines. So, be in
[2:01:09] comfortable territory. And uh you girls
[2:01:12] enjoy yourself. You're very privileged
[2:01:14] to be able to travel like you travel. A
[2:01:17] lot of people not be able to travel like
[2:01:18] that. And u and there you are going to
[2:01:21] be right there with him.
[2:01:24] I tell you what, man. You You try to go
[2:01:26] I went two three weeks to Jamaica I mean
[2:01:28] to Philippines without June and I went
[2:01:29] back crazy. So, but I got over
[2:01:34] it. I said I got over being back
[2:01:37] crazy. Not over her. But let's pray that
[2:01:40] they have a safe trip, wonderful trip.
[2:01:42] They'll meet somebody they never met
[2:01:43] before. They'll get a revelation.
[2:01:46] They'll be able to what? they'll be able
[2:01:48] to give a light in that other country
[2:01:51] that may be somewhere restaurant or or
[2:01:53] somewhere like that. Meet somebody you
[2:01:55] never met before and that you'll be able
[2:01:58] to shine a light and they'll go, "Hey,
[2:01:59] where you from? Hey, what I build
[2:02:02] something a little different, a little
[2:02:03] special. So, let's bind together." Come
[2:02:06] on to heavenly father. Lord, our brother
[2:02:10] for his job, Lord, he has to go across
[2:02:12] the water, Lord, and go into a country
[2:02:14] that's not not his birth country,
[2:02:17] Father. Lord, it'll be a strange land,
[2:02:19] Father, there. We pray that you'll just
[2:02:22] be with him, Lord, and his family,
[2:02:23] Father. Just bind them close together,
[2:02:26] that nothing will happen to them, Lord,
[2:02:27] as they travel. All the baggage will get
[2:02:30] there on time and everything will come
[2:02:31] together, Lord. No, no accidents or or
[2:02:34] not even any sickness because we know
[2:02:36] when you go to a foreign country, as
[2:02:39] much as we try to be safe, there's
[2:02:41] always that chance of of getting sick.
[2:02:43] So, we we sure don't want them to get
[2:02:45] sick at all about anything. Father, just
[2:02:48] be with them. May the word of God wrap
[2:02:50] their arms around them and they wrap
[2:02:53] their arms around you, Lord. And I pray
[2:02:55] that you'd be with them, Lord. Give them
[2:02:57] safe journey, Lord, and be back here in
[2:02:58] a few months. I pray that you'd just
[2:03:00] give him strength, Lord. Maybe give them
[2:03:01] all a testimony that they can tell.
[2:03:03] Lord, when they get back, Father, I
[2:03:05] pray, Lord, that you'd just fill this
[2:03:06] void though that we have here, Lord.
[2:03:08] They're such a intricral part of the
[2:03:10] church, Father. I pray that you'd be
[2:03:11] with them, Lord. And Lord, just fill
[2:03:13] that void for a little while, Lord. And
[2:03:15] as they return, Father, back to their
[2:03:17] homeland, Father. And I pray, Lord, it
[2:03:19] will we'll give you all the honor and
[2:03:21] praise and the glory for everything,
[2:03:23] Lord. Jesus name we pray. Amen. God
[2:03:26] bless you. Amen. Love you, buddy.
[2:03:29] Appreciate you. gonna miss you. Get out
[2:03:31] of
[2:03:33] here. Separation
[2:03:36] anxiety. All right, let's read our uh
[2:03:39] footwashing. Uh John 13 27
[2:03:44] through17 supper being ended, the devil
[2:03:47] having now put into the heart of Judas
[2:03:49] this cararat Simon's son to betray him.
[2:03:51] Jesus knowing that the father had given
[2:03:52] all things into his hands and he was
[2:03:54] come from God and he went to God. He
[2:03:56] rises from supper and laid aside his
[2:03:58] garment and took a towel and girded
[2:03:59] himself. After that he poured water into
[2:04:02] a basin and began to wash the disciples
[2:04:03] feet and to wipe them with a p towel
[2:04:06] wherewith he was girded. Then cometh he
[2:04:08] to Simon Peter and Peter said unto him,
[2:04:10] Lord, does thou wash my feet? No doubt
[2:04:12] in Peter's mind he's like, man, this guy
[2:04:14] walked on water. This guy's raised the
[2:04:18] dead. This guy's healed the sick by the
[2:04:20] thousands. He's multiplied fish and fed
[2:04:24] 5,000 at one time and several thousand
[2:04:25] at another
[2:04:27] time and he's getting in front of me one
[2:04:29] way. I don't want that to happen. That's
[2:04:31] that's not what I want to happen. That
[2:04:33] he just shouldn't have to do that.
[2:04:35] That's what Peter's saying. Do you wash
[2:04:37] my feet? Jesus answered and said, "What
[2:04:40] I do, thou knowest not now, but thou
[2:04:43] shalt know hereafter."
[2:04:45] Peter said unto him, "Thou shalt never,
[2:04:46] don't ever say never to Jesus,
[2:04:49] cuz he'll uh he'll make you pay for it.
[2:04:51] Thou shalt never wash my feet." Jesus
[2:04:53] answered and said, "Hey, look, if I wash
[2:04:56] thee not, you will have no part with
[2:05:01] me." How strong is that?
[2:05:04] Simon Peter said, "Lord, not my feet
[2:05:06] only, but also my hands and my head."
[2:05:10] Jesus said unto him, "He that is
[2:05:12] washed," now he's talking about the
[2:05:13] natural part. "He that is washed,
[2:05:14] neither not saved to wash his feet, but
[2:05:16] is clean ever with, and you're clean,
[2:05:17] but not all." For he knew he should
[2:05:19] betray him, therefore he said, "You are
[2:05:21] not all clean." So after he had washed
[2:05:24] their feet, taken his garments, and sat
[2:05:25] down, he said unto them, "Know you what
[2:05:27] I've done to you?" Asked him a question.
[2:05:29] You call me Master and Lord, and you
[2:05:30] say, "Well, for so I am. If I then, your
[2:05:33] Lord and Master. If I, then, the head of
[2:05:35] the
[2:05:37] universe, the creator of all
[2:05:40] things, have washed your feet, you also
[2:05:43] ought to wash one another's feet. For I
[2:05:45] have given you an example that you
[2:05:47] should do as I have done to you. Verily,
[2:05:49] verily, I say unto you, the servant is
[2:05:51] not greater than his Lord, neither he
[2:05:52] that is sent, greater than he that sent
[2:05:55] him. If you know these things, what?
[2:05:58] Let's all say it together. Happy are ye
[2:06:02] if you do them. Let's bow our heads.
[2:06:04] Dear heavenly father, Lord, we're
[2:06:06] heading into the second part of the
[2:06:07] service. I pray, Lord, that we've said
[2:06:09] something to help the people, Father,
[2:06:11] because it's all centered around the
[2:06:13] body of Christ now, Lord. It's not the
[2:06:16] signs and the different things. It's
[2:06:17] it's here. The intimate relationship
[2:06:19] that we have with you, Lord. Lord, just
[2:06:21] may it be more and more closer and
[2:06:23] closer, Lord. Be with us all. take care
[2:06:25] of us as we continue, Lord, and and
[2:06:27] leave and go our separate ways and come
[2:06:29] back, Brother Aaron, on Wednesday night,
[2:06:30] Lord. I pray that you'd be with him, be
[2:06:32] with our travels, Lord, as we continue
[2:06:34] on, Lord, and go take a few days off,
[2:06:36] Father. I pray that you'd bless us,
[2:06:38] Lord. Be with the ones that are sick. Be
[2:06:40] with the ones that are sin sick, Father,
[2:06:42] more than ever, Father, go to their
[2:06:44] heart and tug on their heartstring,
[2:06:46] Lord, and bring them back into the fold.
[2:06:49] Father, just bless us. Forgive us of our
[2:06:50] sins in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you.
[2:06:53] You're dismissed. Sisters, go
[2:06:54] downstairs. Be reverent.
