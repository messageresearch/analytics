[19:30] first john the third chapter
[19:34] well let's pray first heavenly father we
[19:36] thank you for these words that we are
[19:38] going to read
[19:39] but we pray that everyone that read and
[19:41] hears these words lord that they become
[19:43] a part of their life lord and that we
[19:45] just
[19:46] always remember you love for whatsoever
[19:48] that we have need of because you're
[19:50] always with us you always care for us
[19:52] and you always love us and we thank you
[19:54] for it and ask you to bless
[19:56] this service this morning in jesus name
[19:58] we pray
[19:59] amen amen
[20:02] first verse behold what man of love the
[20:05] father has bestowed upon us that we
[20:07] should call the sons of god
[20:10] that we should be called the sons of god
[20:12] therefore the world knows us not because
[20:15] it knew him not
[20:28] we shall be like him for we shall see
[20:31] him as he is
[20:33] and everyone that has his hope in
[20:36] him purify himself even as he is pure
[20:40] who is whatever
[20:45] for sin is the transgression of the law
[20:49] and we know
[20:50] that he was manifested to take away our
[20:53] sin and in him is no sin
[20:57] who shall
[20:59] not
[21:00] whosoever
[21:05] little children let no man deceive you
[21:08] he that doeth righteous
[21:11] who says that doeth rashness is
[21:13] righteous and even
[21:16] as he is righteousness
[21:31] whosoever is born of god doeth not
[21:33] commit sin
[21:35] for his seed remains in him and he
[21:38] cannot sin because he is born of
[21:43] the children of god are manifest
[21:45] in the children of the devil
[21:47] whosoever does not righteousness is not
[21:50] god
[21:51] neither him the love not his brother
[21:55] for this is the message that ye heard
[21:58] from the beginning that we should love
[22:00] one another
[22:02] god is that a wicked one
[22:07] and wherefore
[22:17] if the world hate you
[22:20] we know that we have to
[22:22] have life
[22:24] because
[22:30] whosoever hates his brother
[22:34] is a murderer
[22:35] and you know that no murderer has
[22:38] eternal life abiding in him
[22:41] here with god receive we the love of god
[22:44] because he raised my father for us
[22:50] forever
[22:51] but whosoever
[22:54] has this world's good and saith his
[22:56] brother have need and shed up his vows
[23:00] of compassion from him
[23:02] how dwelleth the love of god in
[23:07] let us him love the word
[23:13] and hereby we know that we
[23:17] are of the truth
[23:18] and shall assure
[23:20] our hearts before him
[23:23] forever
[23:26] greater than our heart and knoweth all
[23:29] things
[23:30] beloved if our heart condemn us not
[23:34] then we
[23:35] have confidence toward god
[23:48] and this is the commandment
[23:50] that we should believe on the name of
[23:53] the son of jesus christ
[23:56] and love one another as he gave us a
[24:03] world commandment him and in him
[24:06] and hereby will know that he abides in
[24:09] us
[24:10] by the spirit
[24:24] let's turn over to 172.
[24:28] 172 in this final one

[28:08] visitors back there there may be some
[28:10] that have never been here and you have

[33:28] uh brother terrance says i can't preach
[33:30] over 45 minutes so
[33:32] or the check bounces
[33:41] man if you have your bibles this morning
[33:43] turn with me to isaiah chapter 61.
[33:50] and we'll read with verse one through
[33:51] three
[33:56] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[33:58] because the lord hath anointed me to
[34:00] preach good tidings and to the meek he
[34:03] sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to
[34:05] proclaim liberty to the captives
[34:07] and the opening of the prison to them
[34:09] that are bound to proclaim the
[34:11] acceptable year of the lord and the day
[34:13] of vengeance of our god to comfort all
[34:15] that mourn to appoint unto them that
[34:18] mourn in zion to give unto them beauty
[34:20] for ashes the oil of joy for mourning
[34:23] the garment of praise for the spirit of
[34:24] heaviness that they might be called
[34:26] trees of righteousness the planting of
[34:28] the lord that he might be glorified may
[34:32] god had his blessing you may be seated
[34:35] i'm going to read a few more scriptures
[34:36] but
[34:38] i want to speak this morning on being
[34:40] anointed for the rapture
[34:43] and i want to look at that word anointed
[34:45] there in isaiah 61
[34:48] and verse 1 it actually means to
[34:51] to smear or to anoint or to spread and
[34:56] in first john 2 and 20 he says but you
[34:59] have an unction from the holy one and
[35:02] you know all things and that word
[35:04] unction
[35:05] actually means anointing right
[35:09] and so it means to smear and first john
[35:11] i'm just going to go through these
[35:12] scriptures quickly so i can lay this
[35:14] foundation move on but first john 2 and
[35:17] 27 says but the anointing which you have
[35:19] received of him abideth in you and you
[35:23] need not that any man teach you
[35:25] but as the same anointing teaches you
[35:27] all things and his truth and is no lie
[35:31] even as it had taught you you shall
[35:33] abide in him
[35:35] and then first thessalonians chapter 4
[35:37] and verse
[35:39] 15 which we know is the the rapture
[35:42] scripture
[35:43] for this we say unto you by the word of
[35:45] the lord that we which are alive and
[35:47] remain unto the coming of the lord shall
[35:48] not prevent them which are asleep or
[35:51] brother adam said hinder them right for
[35:53] the lord himself shall descend from
[35:55] heaven with a shout and with the voice
[35:56] of the archangel and with the trump of
[35:59] god and the dead in christ shall rise
[36:01] first then which we are alive and remain
[36:03] shall be caught up together
[36:05] with them in the clouds to meet the lord
[36:08] in the air and so shall we ever be with
[36:09] the lord now paul is speaking
[36:12] about two different dimensions there
[36:14] he's speaking about a dimension that is
[36:15] asleep right and he's speaking about one
[36:17] that is alive all right and now we know
[36:20] it's the order of the rapture but
[36:22] actually the word rapture is never used
[36:24] in the bible
[36:25] so the word rapture actually means to be
[36:27] snatched up or to be caught up
[36:30] and in second corinthians 12 and 2
[36:33] paul says
[36:35] i knew a man in christ about 14 years
[36:37] ago whether in the body i cannot tell or
[36:39] whether out of the body i cannot kill
[36:41] god knoweth
[36:42] such and one caught up to the third
[36:45] heaven amen and i knew such a man
[36:47] whether in the body or out of the body i
[36:49] cannot tell god knoweth how that he was
[36:52] caught up in the paradise and heard
[36:54] unspeakable words which is not lawful
[36:57] from and to others right so the word
[36:59] that paul uses is to be caught up right
[37:03] and that's what we're all here for this
[37:05] morning is to catch the word of god that
[37:08] would so transform our bodies and place
[37:11] us in the rapture amen
[37:14] amen so the word there
[37:16] there's still a people
[37:18] as we'll turn to first corinthians 15
[37:20] and 25 but there's still a people who
[37:23] will defy death who will not taste death
[37:27] and our last enemy death will be put
[37:30] under our feet and destroyed
[37:34] where's that water at does this sit
[37:35] right here
[37:36] i drink a lot of water man
[37:39] especially when i'm nervous
[37:44] but he says first corinthians 15 25 says
[37:46] for he must reign till he had put all
[37:49] enemies under his feet and the last
[37:53] enemy that shall be destroyed is death
[37:57] now that word destroyed there actually
[38:00] means to do away with
[38:02] to abolish
[38:04] to lose
[38:06] to deliver
[38:07] i like this this definition to render
[38:10] idle
[38:11] unemployed
[38:13] inactivate right inoperative to cause a
[38:17] person or a thing to have no further
[38:19] efficiency to deprive a force
[38:22] to cause to cease
[38:24] and to put it into right to do away with
[38:28] all right there's a lot of things you
[38:30] there a lot of definitions of that word
[38:32] but one thing is for sure when he puts
[38:35] death under his feet that we will be
[38:38] victorious forevermore
[38:41] i say what a day of what a time an hour
[38:44] that it is going to be right brother
[38:46] branham says this some glorious day the
[38:48] last enemy i have which is death will be
[38:51] trampled right under the feet as the
[38:53] conqueror we shall march through the
[38:57] city right man
[38:59] listen we don't welcome death right
[39:02] because then this is life that's glory
[39:04] we don't believe there's very few people
[39:06] you'll ever meet that want to die
[39:09] but that's our last enemy
[39:12] death
[39:13] and will be destroyed
[39:15] and listen we know sicknesses and
[39:18] diseases and infirmities that's part of
[39:20] satan's kingdom but the scripture tells
[39:23] us it'll be destroyed it'll be rendered
[39:25] idle it'll be useless it'll be abolished
[39:29] it'll be done away with the pain you
[39:31] build this morning will be done away
[39:33] with there'll be a time when there'll be
[39:35] no more pain there'll be no more sorrow
[39:38] there'll be no more heartaches all will
[39:40] be peace forevermore
[39:43] that's why that's why we're here this
[39:44] morning
[39:46] i have to take this off jesus
[39:51] so we believe in the supernatural
[39:54] we believe in healing we do we believe
[39:56] in miracles the brother testified this
[39:58] morning of the healing he received in
[40:00] his body wednesday night right
[40:02] tonight if we open the testimony service
[40:05] we'd be here all night long
[40:08] and it's not just here god's working
[40:10] everywhere in the body of christ
[40:13] so we have we have
[40:14] so many things that's happened recently
[40:16] at home we've had
[40:17] two sisters killed with cancer glory we
[40:20] had a sister who had cancer on her on
[40:22] her kidney about the size of a nickel or
[40:24] corner doctor gets in there and starts
[40:26] performing the surgery and it was gone
[40:28] amen
[40:29] all right
[40:30] so well those things listen when she
[40:32] come up for prayer that wednesday night
[40:34] i believe it was
[40:36] when inspiration hits you you just have
[40:38] to speak what he places right amen
[40:41] and just the thought come to my mind
[40:43] when brother branham was there and the
[40:44] angel of the lord said you say how to be
[40:48] and it'll be that way right and he said
[40:51] before the doctor's hands can touch her
[40:54] may the tumor be gone right and i just
[40:57] repeated what he said
[40:59] listen there's still power in the spoken
[41:02] word
[41:03] and i repeat it when it's had already
[41:06] said and believed it and when the doctor
[41:09] got there there's no more cancer
[41:12] and they told us that you also have a
[41:13] female cancer
[41:15] we need to do a complete surgery
[41:17] i told i told brother french i said if
[41:19] god healed one
[41:21] amen i believe he healed the other right
[41:23] and there was no cancer there either
[41:26] there was a sister just a couple of
[41:27] months ago she went to the hospital and
[41:29] said oh you've got a tumor
[41:31] on your right lung she had the tumor on
[41:33] her left bone you have a tumor on your
[41:35] right lung
[41:36] and she said well jason what am i going
[41:38] to do i know the lord's in my heart
[41:39] we're just going to pray
[41:42] there's power in prayer
[41:44] so we prayed for two days later the
[41:47] doctor comes in runs the exam again runs
[41:49] another cat scan he says well i don't
[41:51] have to do a third cat scan because the
[41:53] first cat scan showed a tumor the second
[41:56] one didn't show one but i know i saw one
[41:58] and when he examined her again there
[42:00] still wasn't a tube listen when god does
[42:03] something he don't do it halfway he does
[42:06] a perfect job
[42:10] i'll try to move on with testifying but
[42:12] sometimes those things build our faith
[42:14] that's what they're there for
[42:17] i i got to give this one another and
[42:18] then i'll move on there
[42:21] these things help you get into the mode
[42:23] for rapture right
[42:25] these things give you rapturing faith
[42:28] it's the word exactly and when a sister
[42:31] come up for prayer she was born with one
[42:33] leg shorter than the other
[42:35] and she comes up for prayer and she was
[42:36] a young lady probably
[42:38] i don't know 23
[42:40] 22 somewhere in there
[42:42] and she says i want you to pray that my
[42:44] leg grew out right
[42:46] well
[42:47] bless her heart she had a lot of faith
[42:49] right
[42:51] so i prayed
[42:52] a week later she comes back she goes i
[42:54] want you to pray
[42:56] that i'll have more faith come on that's
[42:58] it to believe right i'm on what i've
[43:01] asked for hey right and in one month's
[43:04] time her leg was the same length as the
[43:07] other mom well i don't believe you've
[43:09] done too late to tell me god don't heal
[43:12] god don't perform miracles god don't
[43:15] move in a supernatural realm he sent his
[43:18] word and it healed them right glory
[43:21] right
[43:24] so satan he listen he don't have a claim
[43:27] upon you
[43:28] you've been abducted sons and daughters
[43:31] of jesus christ you've been bought with
[43:34] the price he has give you the ceremony
[43:36] has been said over you he's placed you
[43:38] into the body professionally right
[43:42] right
[43:43] rims is a 1960 kinsman redeemer
[43:51] he said let's get down to the end of it
[43:52] now
[43:54] let's skip down the paragraph here he
[43:56] said first you belong to him
[43:59] because you you were his property for
[44:00] you were born in sin shaped in iniquity
[44:03] you come to the world speaking lies and
[44:05] he could not redeem it he could not read
[44:08] him so christ come
[44:10] and made man to take away every
[44:14] all of our sins to redeem us do you see
[44:17] it and the other man couldn't do it the
[44:20] devil couldn't die for sins because he
[44:22] was the very provider who made sick
[44:26] hallelujah see
[44:27] he could not he he marred his
[44:30] inheritance the other fellow and satan
[44:33] would mark his because he is the devil
[44:35] right he could not become another devil
[44:38] to take away the first devil right
[44:40] he could not become sin because he
[44:42] already was sin but christ being sinless
[44:46] become a center that he could redeem us
[44:50] hallelujah we are redeemed which means
[44:53] to be brought back right exactly amen
[44:56] glory the devil did not bring you this
[44:59] message
[45:00] he did not want you to see the end time
[45:02] message but he listen this message came
[45:05] to you on the wings of healing and
[45:08] restoration and listen there i will
[45:12] abide in amen
[45:17] those that are alive and remain will
[45:18] defy the laws of man
[45:21] listen we're going to be the happiest
[45:23] people on planet earth this morning just
[45:26] to know brother samuel we are a part of
[45:28] this group there's going to be somebody
[45:31] that no case there somebody will
[45:34] experience a body treatment somebody's
[45:36] gonna be there all right
[45:38] might as well claim it as you
[45:44] right
[45:46] now the anointing
[45:49] among some people i know you're you're
[45:52] very well taught here but among some
[45:53] people
[45:54] the anointing is not
[45:56] very well understood
[45:58] right people get a lot of misconceptions
[46:01] of what the anointing is
[46:04] and a lot of people
[46:06] say well boy they was anointed when they
[46:08] sing that song
[46:09] yeah really
[46:12] how did you know
[46:14] how can you tell right
[46:16] well
[46:17] you probably have a hard time telling me
[46:19] exactly how you knew yeah well well they
[46:22] moved the people so does a good auction
[46:26] here have a gift to get in your pocket
[46:29] right
[46:31] so does a good salesman yeah he can get
[46:34] up here a good motivational speaker and
[46:36] that i ain't but some of them can get up
[46:37] here and move the people and cause great
[46:40] big offerings that come in or whatever
[46:41] they're doing their great big seminars
[46:43] and cause everybody to sign up under a
[46:45] pyramid and everything else you know
[46:47] i didn't mean to go there but then
[46:52] yeah
[46:54] but oh man hey that guy was anointed
[46:58] but what was he anointed of right come
[47:00] on
[47:01] see oh well the preacher he was
[47:03] certainly anointed this morning he
[47:05] screamed and hollered and ran and
[47:07] sweated and oh man did you just see how
[47:10] much he was just that sweating and
[47:12] everybody just ooh and on and yeah well
[47:14] he stinks now
[47:19] that don't make him anointed
[47:22] listen wrestlers do the same thing
[47:26] they holler and they boast and they
[47:28] scream and they fight and and you know
[47:30] they sweat and they stink and that
[47:32] didn't make them anointed of the holy
[47:34] ghost
[47:35] so most people really don't know what
[47:37] the anointing is oh lord anoint me well
[47:39] what are you asking for
[47:42] what are we wanting to happen
[47:45] now the word anointing actually came
[47:48] from the eastern world and
[47:50] they would take an object when it was
[47:52] first mentioned back in history and they
[47:54] would anoint this object this scope or
[47:57] or some kind of a stone and they would
[47:59] set it aside
[48:02] and consecrate it
[48:05] set aside for a purpose
[48:08] the first time the word anointing is
[48:09] used is in exodus
[48:11] chapter 25 and verse six
[48:14] oil for light spices for anointing all
[48:17] for the sweet incense so the people were
[48:19] familiar
[48:21] with
[48:22] an anointing but now god is giving this
[48:25] a more meaningful purpose right it's not
[48:28] just to come out here and anoint a stone
[48:31] with or to anoint some stump with but
[48:33] he's moving this thing now in exodus 28
[48:36] and 41 and thou shalt put up them upon
[48:40] aaron
[48:41] and thy brother and his sons and shall
[48:44] anoint them and consecrate them and
[48:47] sanctify them that they may minister
[48:50] unto me in the priest's office now it's
[48:53] more than a stone or a place or
[48:54] something like that god's telling moses
[48:57] to take that anointing or and anoint the
[49:00] ministry and sanctify them and
[49:03] consecrate them
[49:06] this is a little greater than a stone
[49:08] right
[49:09] it's a little greater than a stump
[49:11] somewhere
[49:12] anoint the priest that his sons and
[49:15] anoint the altar with oil right
[49:18] and through there the whole journey they
[49:21] kept that anointing oil they never get
[49:23] away with the anointing
[49:25] amen and when the prophet left god
[49:28] didn't do away with the anointing
[49:31] but he left the anointing for his people
[49:37] so now it had a real meaning to him
[49:40] right now they could look and they could
[49:41] see the sons of aaron and they could see
[49:43] aaron see how they were anointed and see
[49:46] all the things there
[49:49] god's wanting to choose a king one day
[49:51] you know
[49:52] for israel you know so he goes to this
[49:54] prophet samuel
[49:56] the people that showed you know the
[49:58] people wanted to saw
[50:01] saw backslides
[50:03] watch now
[50:04] you're still anointed
[50:06] you're not sure
[50:08] backslidden king still annoying right
[50:10] man just because that didn't take the
[50:12] anointing right exactly
[50:14] he was still anointed by the prophet
[50:17] right but god is changing helen says i i
[50:21] need another king i need somebody else
[50:23] to be anointed i need somebody that'll
[50:26] consecrate yourself somebody that'll
[50:28] sanctify themselves somebody that'll
[50:31] keep the word true
[50:33] so now he tells samuel go down to the
[50:36] house of jesse
[50:38] and take the horn
[50:40] which is a power
[50:42] and take the anointing oh which is the
[50:44] spirit yeah
[50:46] with you down there you're going down to
[50:48] anoint a new king now it didn't just
[50:50] fall away samuel thought it would
[50:53] well i'll go down here and
[50:55] i'll pour it up on the first sun that
[50:56] comes out cause he's the best looking
[50:57] and he's the tallest and he's the
[50:59] toughest and
[51:00] he's got big muscles like brother zach
[51:06] god didn't choose him
[51:08] not talking about brother zach but god
[51:09] didn't choose the person
[51:12] second son comes up because that didn't
[51:14] heal me
[51:16] well you have to realize what's
[51:17] happening here
[51:19] there is a transfer
[51:20] taking place right
[51:22] now the prophet starts
[51:24] pouring at all when he finally gets down
[51:26] to david and he says well do you have
[51:28] another one here we got a little boy
[51:30] he's out here in the field he's a little
[51:31] he ain't very tough he has curly
[51:34] hair and all these different things the
[51:35] prophet describes of him and he says
[51:37] well go get it and when he comes into
[51:39] the presence of the prophet the lord
[51:42] says that's him anoint him glory so now
[51:45] he's beginning to there's things
[51:47] happening here he's now god has chosen a
[51:50] person a specific person from a specific
[51:53] household and i want you to anoint him
[51:55] saying it was all god's predestinated
[51:57] plan to begin with right right you
[52:00] anoint him you pour the hole upon him
[52:02] right listen god's not going to send his
[52:05] messenger
[52:07] and anoint the wrong people right
[52:09] glory
[52:11] god wasn't going to send samuel he was
[52:12] going to choose the first one right god
[52:15] wasn't going to send you a messenger in
[52:16] this day and he anointed the the
[52:19] pentecostals with it only he wasn't
[52:21] going to send you a messenger and go
[52:22] anoint the catholics with it but he
[52:24] called out a people out of every walk of
[52:27] life and every faith that there was and
[52:29] he anointed them with this anointed word
[52:33] amen
[52:36] so now
[52:38] david is taking on a different
[52:41] fulfillment in life
[52:43] now he's anointed king
[52:45] right yet he's not placed as king right
[52:48] but he's anointed king right and in the
[52:51] eyes of god he's already done it right
[52:54] because god cannot take back what he
[52:56] says
[52:58] and if god chose him god will keep him
[53:01] right right you know that's where i
[53:03] think david he must have kind of lost
[53:05] sight sometimes during his life of what
[53:08] he was really anointed for um
[53:10] or he'd never been scared of saul right
[53:15] you know you can throw your javelin at
[53:16] me all you want i'm the anointed
[53:19] right i can't be killed right hey how
[53:22] many times do we go through life
[53:25] and hey you are the anointed bride right
[53:27] exactly and you go through life and the
[53:29] devil begins throwing things in your way
[53:31] through sickness action he throws cancer
[53:34] at you and he throws all these obstacles
[53:36] marriage problems and whatever else at
[53:38] you and you wonder what am i going to do
[53:41] but you have forgotten little bride that
[53:44] you have been anointed for the hour
[53:46] you're annoyed for this time and there
[53:49] ain't no devil can take your life
[53:52] there ain't no devil can put anything
[53:54] upon you that god doesn't alive
[53:58] amen
[54:03] so he picks a specific child
[54:08] he didn't look on him for his
[54:09] countenance
[54:12] saul
[54:13] was anointed he's chosen other people
[54:15] sure
[54:17] now
[54:19] up to this point we've moved along we
[54:21] come from a
[54:23] a stump
[54:25] up to a
[54:26] priesthood
[54:28] now up to a kingly position
[54:31] and the hebrews believed that
[54:34] the deity that the prophet represented
[54:38] when poured that all about on yeah upon
[54:42] that king
[54:43] there was a transfer that took place
[54:46] from the deity to the king right exactly
[54:49] and when the king poured out his oil
[54:52] upon you
[54:53] right there was a transfer took place
[54:56] and he took a part of himself and he
[54:59] poured part of that deity upon you that
[55:02] when you speak the word of god it's the
[55:05] same as deity speaking the prophet said
[55:08] amen amen so you have a right to believe
[55:10] that everything you speak under his word
[55:14] has to come to pass amen
[55:17] you have to recognize who you are right
[55:20] you have been anointed
[55:28] minister brother
[55:31] back toward home he said
[55:33] 25 years ago he's preaching in phoenix
[55:36] and he's preaching at a big meeting
[55:37] there's about 1500 people there
[55:40] he's preaching on
[55:41] pretty much knowing your authority and
[55:43] knowing who you were
[55:45] and how to speak to the enemy
[55:47] he said at the end of the service woman
[55:49] stood up back over in the back corner
[55:51] and started screaming
[55:53] and she was
[55:55] screaming just the hideous screaming
[55:57] you know just going down and just making
[56:00] grunting noises and growling noises and
[56:03] he said 25 pictures behind me thought
[56:05] she was in the spirit yeah
[56:08] and she come down the middle island he
[56:10] thought you know what
[56:12] what am i going to do
[56:13] right
[56:14] he said but i didn't want these other
[56:16] guys
[56:17] to know that i didn't know what i was
[56:18] going to do
[56:21] i just got through preaching on
[56:23] knowing who you was
[56:25] ignoring your authority
[56:27] and that you have the power to bind the
[56:29] devil right
[56:31] so he said i just stepped down there in
[56:32] the front matter
[56:33] he said one of these preachers just
[56:35] staring
[56:36] he said later asking what was he doing
[56:37] so i've never seen a devil cast out like
[56:39] that so i want to watch yeah
[56:41] and he said i looked at her she comes up
[56:43] she's bowing down just
[56:46] you know just going through her little
[56:48] rant and he said
[56:49] that's a catholic spirit yeah oh my
[56:52] he said i didn't know she was a member
[56:54] of one of these brothers congregations
[56:55] yeah oh my
[56:57] it really didn't matter
[56:59] because that's a catholic spirit and
[57:01] because you have defied the spirit of
[57:04] the living god
[57:05] come out of her and he said when he said
[57:07] that he said a wind come down through
[57:09] that building and her eyes that were
[57:11] wild went back to being normal and
[57:13] healings began happening all over the
[57:15] whole building
[57:16] listen those things are real spirits are
[57:19] real but so is the anointed word of god
[57:22] really when it comes to anoint the pride
[57:24] in this last night there will be a
[57:27] people who will be an invincible army
[57:31] glory
[57:37] so
[57:38] now the transferal of holiness
[57:42] and righteousness
[57:44] and virtue
[57:45] and a special endowment by the holy
[57:47] spirit and if you have the right
[57:50] representation
[57:51] representative anoint you
[57:54] and that representative come to the
[57:56] right people
[57:58] because samuel didn't come to their own
[58:00] person come to the right person exactly
[58:02] and it all begins to fall in line right
[58:05] you begin to see life changed you'll
[58:08] begin to see the holy ghost take a hold
[58:10] of people and begin to cut off the
[58:12] things of the world and begin to shake
[58:14] off every unclean thing and people
[58:16] become dedicated to the word of god they
[58:19] fall in love with jesus christ i like
[58:22] how one brother says you don't need all
[58:23] your marriage seminars that the world
[58:26] has given out here what you need is the
[58:28] holy ghost and the holy ghost can take
[58:30] care of most anything you'd ever need
[58:33] amen
[58:35] exactly
[58:38] you know when the anointing came
[58:42] it didn't mean a whole lot to the
[58:45] miracle seekers all right
[58:47] didn't have an effect upon them but when
[58:50] it comes to the chosen
[58:53] one
[58:54] right and the prophet was sent
[58:56] to a certain house
[58:58] to a certain person of the house
[59:00] and now this anointing had been
[59:02] entrusted to a certain individual come
[59:05] on
[59:06] listen it was greater now than it had
[59:08] been but it wasn't just going to stay
[59:11] there there was going to come one
[59:13] greater than what david was that was
[59:16] going to have a greater anointing than
[59:18] david ever had
[59:21] so yeah now it's moving to a greater
[59:23] time and i was preaching on some things
[59:25] back home recently and we went through
[59:27] the
[59:28] five comings of elijah and down through
[59:30] some other things during the scripture
[59:32] and the death and or the the birth and
[59:35] the
[59:35] burial and the crucifixion and the
[59:37] resurrection and the taking of the book
[59:41] because i began to look at that each
[59:42] time he came
[59:44] he got greater right
[59:47] amen
[59:49] every time this anointing it was just
[59:50] gonna get a little greater
[59:52] and a little greater hey first coming of
[59:55] elijah was great but when he lies you
[59:56] came he did twice the miracles right
[59:58] when john the baptist came look at his
[1:00:00] men and he introduced the messiah right
[1:00:02] and then during this last the sport
[1:00:04] elijah ministry came look at the
[1:00:06] miracles it done right man look at the
[1:00:08] things and watch what happens when it
[1:00:10] goes back to israel and 144 thousand are
[1:00:13] born in one day right amen you talk
[1:00:16] about a powerful word look at the blood
[1:00:18] it gets stronger and stronger and
[1:00:21] stronger and it will never lose its
[1:00:23] power
[1:00:26] so the anointing gets stronger
[1:00:29] and now
[1:00:30] the anointed one was coming like the
[1:00:32] people had never seen before
[1:00:35] and they they misunderstood it before
[1:00:36] they were certain to misunderstand this
[1:00:39] one
[1:00:41] nominations of that day misunderstood
[1:00:43] him
[1:00:44] he's born
[1:00:46] the guy's born illegitimate yeah
[1:00:49] everything else
[1:00:50] and you know jesus
[1:00:53] brother says the greatest anointing
[1:00:54] there ever was
[1:00:56] was upon jesus
[1:01:00] why people are so tossed about brother
[1:01:02] brown says this
[1:01:05] some people get the wrong impression of
[1:01:08] what the anointing is right do you ever
[1:01:10] think of that he said
[1:01:12] when was the greatest anointing ever
[1:01:13] given to anyone and what did they do
[1:01:16] when they had the anointing right the
[1:01:18] greatest anointing was ever given to
[1:01:20] anyone was jesus christ we have the
[1:01:22] spirit by measure he had it without
[1:01:24] mention
[1:01:25] one day he entered the temple and he
[1:01:27] picked up the scroll and he read part of
[1:01:29] the same scripture that we read to begin
[1:01:31] with the spirit of the lord god is upon
[1:01:33] me for he hath anointed me to preach the
[1:01:35] acceptable year to bind up the broken
[1:01:37] heart is the heal the sick give sight to
[1:01:39] the blind now we would think if such an
[1:01:42] anointing was on him that he'd been
[1:01:44] prophesied 800 years before that it
[1:01:46] would come
[1:01:47] there he was with that type of anointing
[1:01:49] the full blessing the anointing of the
[1:01:50] lord upon him we would want to run all
[1:01:52] over the building
[1:01:54] scream and holler
[1:01:56] the bible said he laid down the scroll
[1:01:58] right and sat down amen and precious
[1:02:01] words proceeded from his mouth that's
[1:02:04] what he'd done under
[1:02:06] the anointing right the anointing is not
[1:02:09] emotions
[1:02:13] that people get emotional there's
[1:02:14] nothing wrong with it amen but that's
[1:02:17] not the anointing the anointing is
[1:02:19] supreme
[1:02:20] power
[1:02:21] in control like knowing exactly what and
[1:02:25] how and that's what's here
[1:02:29] listen if it was there then he still
[1:02:32] hebrews 13 8 and that anointing that
[1:02:36] supreme power in control is now here
[1:02:40] it's what's with the bride
[1:02:46] today glory
[1:02:49] amen
[1:02:50] if you took the anointing on jesus to
[1:02:52] preach
[1:02:53] and surely it takes the anointing on us
[1:02:55] to preach within the faith
[1:02:58] right
[1:02:58] no minister one time's in
[1:03:00] i
[1:03:04] yeah
[1:03:05] and he's backslidden
[1:03:07] yeah
[1:03:08] whatever else
[1:03:10] has nothing to do with your talent of
[1:03:11] being able to deliver words
[1:03:15] has nothing to do with that right it has
[1:03:17] to do with consecrating and sanctifying
[1:03:21] and dedicating yourself to the word of
[1:03:23] god and being in prayer with god and
[1:03:26] letting the power of the holy ghost come
[1:03:28] upon you and give you the thing that the
[1:03:32] people has needed
[1:03:34] listen it would be easy to get through
[1:03:36] well today i'm gonna teach on first john
[1:03:38] and i just go through all that i just
[1:03:39] break it down and break it down and
[1:03:41] break it down but if it didn't come to
[1:03:42] me by inspiration how's it ever going to
[1:03:44] inspire you right right
[1:03:47] right
[1:03:49] amen
[1:03:50] but i just pick up a
[1:03:52] church age book and i just start well
[1:03:54] working today
[1:03:55] because i've worked so hard this week
[1:03:57] we're just gonna go through the church
[1:03:58] age book
[1:04:00] and that didn't come inspired to me to
[1:04:01] go through the church milk
[1:04:03] what good is it gonna do you right
[1:04:06] so it takes the anointing
[1:04:08] every time
[1:04:11] regardless what we think if you're not
[1:04:13] of europe here and you're not anointed
[1:04:16] what good is it going to do the people
[1:04:18] right so we now have the messiah which
[1:04:22] means the anointed one
[1:04:24] and at the day that john baptized him
[1:04:26] jesus at the river one of the greatest
[1:04:28] events that had ever taken place the
[1:04:30] land would have been said the meekest of
[1:04:32] the hall
[1:04:33] and the creator creatures of the earth
[1:04:36] and the dove the meekest of all the
[1:04:37] fowls of heaven and when the dove came
[1:04:40] down and john saw jesus and said behold
[1:04:43] the lamb of god that takes away the sins
[1:04:46] of the world amen
[1:04:50] oh brother jason he had to
[1:04:52] grow into being god
[1:05:00] he was the word
[1:05:02] born amen and made flesh amen
[1:05:14] amen
[1:05:15] behold the lamb of god that takes away
[1:05:17] the sins of the world and john said i
[1:05:20] bear record seeing the spirit of god
[1:05:22] like a dove coming down out of heaven
[1:05:24] and abiding on him and the dove and the
[1:05:27] lamb uniting together
[1:05:32] listen
[1:05:33] he was the messiah the anointed
[1:05:37] one the kingly one
[1:05:40] he was born emanuel right
[1:05:44] well brother brown had to mature
[1:05:47] into being a prophet
[1:05:51] well
[1:05:53] i'll agree god showed him more things as
[1:05:55] he went on time okay but he was born
[1:06:00] prophets are born prophets
[1:06:03] you
[1:06:13] gift in his life it was there before the
[1:06:15] foundation of the world and the very
[1:06:18] second he was born he was a prophet
[1:06:25] so messiah was the anointed one right
[1:06:29] brother brown talks about the messiah
[1:06:31] sign
[1:06:33] some 500 and something times
[1:06:36] so i'm not going to read all the quotes
[1:06:39] or i won't get done 45 minutes
[1:06:46] i told him i'd get him back from last
[1:06:47] night
[1:06:49] so while jesus was sitting there alone
[1:06:51] in jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:06:53] and forever
[1:06:54] he says nobody around there was a lady
[1:06:56] come out of the city went to draw some
[1:06:58] water she was a samaritan yeah and the
[1:07:00] samaritans have do you have gentile kind
[1:07:02] of a crossbreed and there was there was
[1:07:05] very much what at one another throats at
[1:07:07] that day so while jesus was sitting
[1:07:09] there the woman she come to him and he
[1:07:11] says woman give me a drink and she says
[1:07:13] it's not customary that i give you a
[1:07:15] drink
[1:07:16] jesus tells her but if you knew who you
[1:07:18] was talking to
[1:07:20] you would ask me for a drink and i'd
[1:07:23] bring you water that you didn't know
[1:07:26] where it even come from you come to draw
[1:07:28] here of natural water but the water i'm
[1:07:30] going to give you is water of eternal
[1:07:33] life
[1:07:35] now after a while he said
[1:07:37] she sits there and well the well's deep
[1:07:39] i've got nothing to draw with and he
[1:07:42] says
[1:07:44] she says when when do you get this water
[1:07:46] but our father's worshipped in this
[1:07:48] mountain
[1:07:49] and you say that jerusalem meant up to
[1:07:50] worship god and he said their time is
[1:07:52] coming and now is right
[1:07:55] when men need a worship hero or at
[1:07:57] jerusalem and the conversation went on
[1:08:01] and after a while
[1:08:02] program 44 after a while i explained to
[1:08:05] you
[1:08:06] what he was talking talk to her and i
[1:08:08] will now he was trying to catch her
[1:08:10] spirit
[1:08:11] and as soon as he found out where her
[1:08:13] trouble was taking to her a long enough
[1:08:16] time to catch her spirit and see where
[1:08:18] the trouble was the father had told him
[1:08:19] to go up there but he didn't know what
[1:08:21] was going to happen when he got there
[1:08:24] the only thing he knew just go there and
[1:08:26] talk to a woman
[1:08:28] that's what the vision has showed him
[1:08:30] yeah but when he got to go and talk to
[1:08:32] this woman he found out where her
[1:08:33] trouble was and he said go get your
[1:08:36] husband yeah yeah
[1:08:39] i don't i don't have a husband
[1:08:42] well
[1:08:44] we probably would have said she lied
[1:08:46] yeah the first one was her husband yeah
[1:08:50] jesus says you've told the truth
[1:08:53] you had five
[1:08:55] and the one you're living with now
[1:08:57] is not even yours
[1:08:59] and she said listen now she knew what
[1:09:02] the anointing would do she had been
[1:09:04] taught something she knew what the
[1:09:06] anointing would do when it come upon a
[1:09:08] person because they were looking for
[1:09:10] this kind of person to come
[1:09:12] and she says sir i perceive that you are
[1:09:15] a prophet amen
[1:09:19] brother brethren says are you ready yeah
[1:09:22] this might shock you real hard
[1:09:26] sir i perceive you're a prophet
[1:09:28] we know that when messiah
[1:09:30] cometh
[1:09:31] the anointed one cometh he will tell us
[1:09:34] these things right but she didn't know
[1:09:36] who he was and what is the sign of
[1:09:38] messiah then those words
[1:09:41] see she said you must be a prophet and i
[1:09:44] know when messiah cometh we know we
[1:09:46] samaritans we've been taught to watch
[1:09:48] the messiah because these signs would be
[1:09:49] on the messiah and when messiah cometh
[1:09:52] he will do these things but she couldn't
[1:09:54] understand who he was and he said i
[1:09:56] am he that speaks to you
[1:10:02] so here's the anointing standing in
[1:10:04] front of her right
[1:10:06] and she dropped her water pot right
[1:10:09] i found this part i find this really
[1:10:11] fascinating and she runs into the city
[1:10:14] and she didn't tell nobody
[1:10:28] prophet come on this man just told me
[1:10:31] listen she goes he told me all
[1:10:34] that i ever done right
[1:10:37] and he told her one thing
[1:10:40] according to the scripture it's only a
[1:10:41] record of exactly right
[1:10:45] you're living with another man it's not
[1:10:46] your husband
[1:10:48] her life became
[1:10:50] an open book man listen she knew that if
[1:10:53] he could tell her how many husbands she
[1:10:55] had he knew everything else about her
[1:10:58] life
[1:10:59] she listen she knew she was in the
[1:11:01] presence of the anointed one
[1:11:04] and when you ever get in his presence
[1:11:07] you will never be the same again he
[1:11:10] changes you from the old man to a new
[1:11:13] man and places his spirit in you glory
[1:11:23] abraham experienced it
[1:11:27] he was given that sign
[1:11:29] there he is sitting one day
[1:11:33] sitting in the door of the tent and he
[1:11:34] looks up and he sees three men walking
[1:11:38] and he says my lord right yeah brother
[1:11:42] said he had a revelation
[1:11:43] right right my lord
[1:11:47] and the lord sits down elohim sits down
[1:11:50] with him and begins talking abraham i
[1:11:52] gave you a promise i've come to visit
[1:11:54] you yeah
[1:11:56] you and sarah
[1:11:58] are fixing to have a baby
[1:12:00] sarah done tried to fulfill this through
[1:12:04] through the bonds woman right
[1:12:06] but now she has been identified right no
[1:12:10] it's not anybody else it's not your
[1:12:12] bonds woman it's sarah your wife right
[1:12:16] she's the one that's gonna bring forth
[1:12:18] the child
[1:12:19] and sarah's sitting in a tip behind him
[1:12:22] she laughs
[1:12:24] and that will come says
[1:12:26] why did she laugh
[1:12:28] that's it
[1:12:29] she laughed at her heart yeah
[1:12:32] but the anointed one was there amen to
[1:12:35] know the very secrets
[1:12:37] of the heart
[1:12:40] and he discerned what was behind him
[1:12:45] listen church
[1:12:47] we have the greatest message that's ever
[1:12:49] came to planet earth
[1:12:51] right and we let the book set on the
[1:12:53] shelves and we let 1206 tapes up there
[1:12:56] and we don't listen to them like we
[1:12:58] ought to listen to and we let them
[1:13:00] collect dust we're going to be held
[1:13:02] accountable for not digging in the word
[1:13:04] exactly
[1:13:06] right all the people at home i said you
[1:13:07] know what some of you just stare at me
[1:13:09] like i've come up with something from

[1:13:32] the scripture says that's thus said the
[1:13:34] lord and you can put everything behind
[1:13:37] that but too many times we lay it all
[1:13:39] upon the preacher

[1:13:56] the anointed word when it comes out it's

[1:16:58] and the king falls in love with her and
[1:17:01] abraham lies
[1:17:04] and says he's going to come after you
[1:17:06] you tell him you're my sister well she

[1:17:16] that was a lie right exactly
[1:17:19] he gets out here and and the king now

[1:17:33] on your own right had not a messenger
[1:17:36] came and told you that they had a body
[1:17:39] change and that's what you are going to
[1:17:42] experience you're going to get the same
[1:17:45] anointed word that came the anointed
[1:17:47] word came to abraham changed his body
[1:17:51] but the only words come to you and it
[1:17:53] will change your body right
[1:17:56] and the king's land in his bed chamber

[1:18:21] you
[1:18:22] or you're going to lose your kingdom
[1:18:33] and when it comes to the cross at
[1:18:35] calvary and got over into the book of
[1:18:37] hebrews that lie was not held in his
[1:18:41] name

[1:19:06] this word will give you what you have
[1:19:08] now listen messiah didn't come to the to
[1:19:11] the pharisees and the sadducees of that
[1:19:13] day and he didn't come to all the great
[1:19:15] big denominations they rejected the word
[1:19:18] made flesh and soul day to today reject
[1:19:22] the word that's been made flesh
[1:19:28] i know there's people that believe
[1:19:29] brother ryden was god
[1:19:31] oh yeah
[1:19:32] we don't believe that
[1:19:35] we do believe
[1:19:37] that it was the same in every detail
[1:19:40] except the corporate body
[1:19:42] that gift came down that anointing came
[1:19:45] down listen and it chose a specific
[1:19:48] individual from a specific family right
[1:19:52] to be the forthcoming of elijah
[1:19:56] why didn't god choose somebody that was
[1:19:58] highly intellectual and highly educated
[1:20:02] yeah cause he needed somebody that could
[1:20:05] speak like us right that's right
[1:20:08] he'll be late right
[1:20:11] of course from the south brother and
[1:20:12] goes to new york he needs an interpreter
[1:20:14] almost yeah
[1:20:17] right and here we are down here with his
[1:20:19] and hanks and canks and tanks and
[1:20:22] and feather tick bands or feather straw
[1:20:24] whatever the beds were and all these
[1:20:26] different sayings you can relate to
[1:20:28] those things and god sent him in your
[1:20:31] own language and you didn't need an
[1:20:33] interpreter to understand it but god
[1:20:36] chose you
[1:20:37] right now out of seven billion people
[1:20:40] this morning he chose a little group
[1:20:42] here in georgia to be part of his wife
[1:20:45] that i could turn down with these people
[1:20:48] the anointed word of god set them on
[1:20:50] fire and get them ready for a rapture
[1:20:52] all right amen
[1:20:54] through the revealing of the word
[1:20:57] i will let them see that the son of man
[1:21:01] has come in this hour and i have
[1:21:03] revealed myself through him amen
[1:21:08] and i've come down
[1:21:10] and yes there's another ones
[1:21:12] and false anointed ones
[1:21:14] yes
[1:21:17] brother preaches the message of northern
[1:21:18] ones at the end time
[1:21:23] and when you listen to that message you
[1:21:24] might be a buzzard
[1:21:27] or you might be an eagle right
[1:21:30] but you'll know which one you are when
[1:21:31] you get through listening
[1:21:33] exactly
[1:21:36] see we look at things sometimes in a
[1:21:38] time element
[1:21:40] and a prophet looks at things
[1:21:42] not in time like we look at him right
[1:21:46] two years before brother brown ever
[1:21:47] preached that message
[1:21:49] he asked brother bischo one time he said
[1:21:51] do you ever get my tape on a normal
[1:21:52] one's at the end that was in 1963 yeah
[1:21:55] and preach it to 65 right
[1:21:58] but let me tell you when god begins
[1:22:00] delivering exactly an anointing word
[1:22:02] brother said i was out there in that
[1:22:04] desert and those mysteries the
[1:22:05] revelations were coming so fast i
[1:22:08] couldn't even keep up with all right
[1:22:14] well i think projection we gotta have
[1:22:16] we're gonna have our systematic rules
[1:22:18] and
[1:22:19] and we gotta have
[1:22:20] everything just perfect
[1:22:23] we have to have two songs
[1:22:26] one special
[1:22:29] and everything's gotta be
[1:22:31] just got the eyes
[1:22:33] yeah listen we i believe in church order
[1:22:37] but brother branham also said
[1:22:39] that sometimes we need to get out of
[1:22:41] church order long enough to get saved
[1:22:46] oh you can church order a church to
[1:22:48] death to where there is no life there is
[1:22:50] no movement and that's not what the
[1:22:52] prophet intended it to be to touch the
[1:22:54] movement of the spirit no he put it in
[1:22:56] order so the spirit couldn't believe
[1:23:00] amen
[1:23:01] bless him because one would want a
[1:23:03] testimony and testify and before you
[1:23:05] know it there's no room for the word
[1:23:07] well the main attraction is the word
[1:23:10] amen
[1:23:12] have one brother tell me he said well we
[1:23:14] normally have more than one special
[1:23:16] sometimes they say more than two songs
[1:23:22] yeah but he said in about 30 minutes or
[1:23:24] a half hour right
[1:23:26] so if you can sing ten songs in a half
[1:23:28] an hour
[1:23:29] you can do it
[1:23:38] listen it's got to be this kind of music
[1:23:39] before church
[1:23:41] well read all the quote
[1:23:43] or something
[1:23:45] like that yeah
[1:23:48] yeah i know you don't have those
[1:23:50] problems here
[1:23:54] what we do in arkansas because
[1:23:56] we're pretty human back there
[1:23:59] and we're known
[1:24:01] i've been told since i've been here our
[1:24:02] heart is known
[1:24:04] as the legal estate
[1:24:08] you've heard that before
[1:24:10] where i go you're from fort hardy
[1:24:13] oh the homer long board said i don't
[1:24:15] pull two runs at fort hardy and i ain't
[1:24:17] going back
[1:24:21] it ain't that way there anymore so man
[1:24:23] you come visit us
[1:24:25] but we do believe there's been a message
[1:24:26] sitting there
[1:24:28] and we do believe that he alone had the
[1:24:31] infallibility of the word
[1:24:34] and we do believe that that message that
[1:24:36] has been preached and been given a life
[1:24:38] for will put us in a rapture and that
[1:24:42] anointed word will prepare
[1:24:44] our lives our thinking our ways for the
[1:24:47] body change and that's what we're here
[1:24:50] for this morning lord shuts my heart
[1:24:53] if there's anything in there that's not
[1:24:55] like your word circumcise that out of me
[1:24:58] that's foreign put your word down in
[1:25:00] there god give me what i have needle to
[1:25:03] make this rapture right right amen
[1:25:06] listen i felt like i was anointed before
[1:25:08] that's not what it's about is there
[1:25:10] supreme power
[1:25:12] in control in your life
[1:25:18] does he have the supreme power yeah
[1:25:21] is he your fault
[1:25:23] is he your breath
[1:25:27] is he your understanding
[1:25:30] is he the word
[1:25:32] made flesh
[1:25:34] to you
[1:25:36] amen
[1:25:38] that's where it has to come to
[1:25:40] the anointing is to confirm
[1:25:43] the word
[1:25:45] and when he came
[1:25:47] listen
[1:25:48] he didn't take his picture with me yeah
[1:25:54] but he chose a set aside
[1:25:56] vessel
[1:25:58] i told one one brother said well
[1:26:00] everything's covered under the atonement
[1:26:01] i said all right
[1:26:03] why did brother brown
[1:26:06] i believe the atonement covers our sins
[1:26:09] but why did brother branham have to keep
[1:26:11] his gift pure yeah
[1:26:13] why couldn't he smoke right
[1:26:16] right
[1:26:16] why couldn't he drink right why couldn't
[1:26:18] he run with wood
[1:26:20] because i have a work right a set aside
[1:26:24] service
[1:26:25] a place that has to be consecrated a
[1:26:28] place that has to be sanctified
[1:26:30] listen that the word can come through
[1:26:33] listen and he's not battling all these
[1:26:34] thoughts that he had in his life well
[1:26:36] that was a broken house and i was that
[1:26:38] no he had enough demon powers to battle
[1:26:40] right he'd battle those demons when he
[1:26:42] went home at night and he would
[1:26:44] constantly in his mind the demons would
[1:26:46] never torment me but yet there that
[1:26:48] anointing would still yet be upon him
[1:26:50] and many nights he would walk down the
[1:26:51] street down through jeffersonville
[1:26:53] swinging his coat over his head walking
[1:26:54] down the street speaking in tongues
[1:27:00] they haven't forbid if that happened
