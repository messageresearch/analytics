[9:49] now to you and have your way now in
[9:51] Jesus name amen
[9:56] amen Ephesians 1:3 where we're
[10:00] using blessed be the God and father of
[10:03] our Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed
[10:05] us with all spiritual blessings in
[10:07] Heavenly places in Christ according as
[10:10] he has chosen Us in him before the
[10:13] foundation of the world that we should
[10:15] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[10:18] love let's stop there now and then we
[10:21] will uh jump over into John because
[10:24] we're you remember what we're doing now
[10:26] to those on the to the those listening
[10:29] in tonight or on the Internet systems
[10:32] and listening to the tapes or whatever
[10:35] at a later
[10:36] time now if you will please stay with me
[10:40] where I'm
[10:42] at because it will take this message and
[10:45] maybe one or two more to be able to uh
[10:49] get down out of Heaven okay amen now
[10:53] that's what we're supposed to be doing
[10:55] and I have to bring out things on you
[10:57] know of doing but try your best to stay
[11:01] down or stay with me and don't try to
[11:04] run it over to the end of the world and
[11:06] and where we are and the new birth and
[11:08] the things uh just stay with me where
[11:10] we're at cuz we're trying to stay back
[11:13] before the foundation of the world right
[11:15] all right and we're trying to find out
[11:18] how that we were
[11:20] chosen and that we were chosen in him
[11:23] all right and then in the choosing part
[11:26] then we can come to that place of you
[11:28] know of seeing uh what's going on then
[11:31] when we come to
[11:33] Earth see then we will I kept emphasized
[11:37] and I will again in just a moment cuz I
[11:39] want this in your
[11:40] mind you can't see what I'm talking
[11:43] about if you think it's your chosen by
[11:45] him or you were chosen of him that's
[11:48] right those are already in the those are
[11:51] things happening in the Earthly Journey
[11:54] that's right cuz if you go back too far
[11:57] with of him or by him and things like
[11:59] that you're going to get into the wrong
[12:02] form of Doctrine or thought and see my
[12:06] thought is to try to get us to see how
[12:08] that we were chosen in him then when we
[12:10] come to the Earth I'll tell you all
[12:12] right now we've come down here and now
[12:14] we can talk about chosen of him or by
[12:16] him and the choosing will be here and
[12:19] our journey of life will have things to
[12:21] do with it but I told you the other week
[12:23] that I gave you one quick run through of
[12:26] how we were going and then you know to
[12:29] able to drop back down and then we will
[12:31] just give quotes and and try to bring it
[12:34] so all right go into
[12:35] John 15 verse
[12:39] 15 henceforth I call you not servants
[12:43] for the servant knoweth not what his
[12:44] Lord doth now I love that scripture
[12:47] right there I could preach all night on
[12:49] the fact that he changed from calling
[12:51] them servants cuz the Old Testament
[12:53] people were called servants right right
[12:56] and then coming over to friends right
[12:58] and you remember even Judas when he
[13:00] came amen he looked at him and he said
[13:03] friend
[13:06] right because you could stay all night
[13:09] right there but okay let's go on
[13:10] henceforth I call you not servants for
[13:12] the servant knoweth not what his Lord
[13:14] doth but I have called you friends for
[13:17] all things that I have heard of my
[13:19] father I have made known unto you listen
[13:23] to
[13:24] it you have not chosen me but I have
[13:28] chosen you and ordained you that you
[13:30] should go forth and bring go and bring
[13:34] forth fruit and that your fruit should
[13:36] remain that whatsoever you shall ask of
[13:39] the father in my name he may give it you
[13:43] amen you may be seated the Lord add his
[13:46] Blessing to the reading of the word now
[13:48] they're trying to get that up and if I
[13:50] can get it up good enough then we'll be
[13:52] going through the quotes and you won't
[13:53] have to do this but if you want these
[13:56] you know uh after service to be able
[13:59] bble to keep I will uh fix them where
[14:02] that we can just you can come by and
[14:04] pick them up right cuz we're going if we
[14:07] can we're going to start using this form
[14:09] of system to where I won't have to make
[14:12] off 60 copies of quotes and we'll let
[14:15] you read here and and Timbo will have to
[14:18] zoom it in to where that they can read
[14:21] it on the uh the thing and now Sister
[14:24] Gail it it all set up now you can holler
[14:26] amen all you want to because the sounds
[14:29] not coming from that anymore it's going
[14:31] back to the machine and back I come no I
[14:35] was you saying you
[14:38] could get brother com no yeah we won't
[14:42] get none been doing all right but now
[14:44] listen like I
[14:46] said if you will stay with me of what
[14:49] I'm trying to say I'll tell you when we
[14:52] drop down to the Earthly Journey which
[14:54] will be many many messages uh probably
[14:58] on down the road road so we're trying to
[15:01] talk about you remember that brother
[15:03] brandom and I ran a bunch of that today
[15:05] looking at it and you remember when
[15:07] brother randam first met the uh what was
[15:09] the Jesus name people or which one it
[15:11] was the Oneness that he ran into and you
[15:14] remember the old black brother and he
[15:16] said all the other preachers had been
[15:18] preaching about what was on Earth and
[15:20] bringing Jesus out of the scriptures and
[15:22] he said man I was really enjoying him
[15:24] and said here come this old man up with
[15:26] a little ring around his of high left
[15:29] and old and had to he him up there you
[15:30] know and an old big old coat on and and
[15:33] said he thought my Lord what are they
[15:36] letting that man up there preach for you
[15:39] know with all these young guys and after
[15:41] a while said he started off said these
[15:43] others are down on Earth said he started
[15:45] off up in heaven MH amen and said he's
[15:48] telling us what's going on in heaven
[15:50] right he said then he brought him down
[15:52] to horizontal rainbow and said you know
[15:54] you know well now I'll tell you when we
[15:57] start down the rainbow okay in the
[15:59] message and you that are listening in
[16:01] please if you'll do that you'll
[16:03] understand what I'm trying to bring CU
[16:05] we read here at Paul said we were chosen
[16:08] in him that's right chosen us to be
[16:12] technical where you will know the
[16:14] scripture part there chosen Us in him
[16:18] all right now as I said if you say we're
[16:22] chosen of
[16:25] him you you know it's getting down to a
[16:29] technical term but you'll see those will
[16:32] relate after we get
[16:33] here and to say chosen by him see you
[16:39] you got to let that come on over to the
[16:41] Earthly
[16:42] Journey cuz if not then you make him a
[16:45] respector of persons and he cannot say
[16:48] that you
[16:51] know that I that I'm not that that I you
[16:54] know you got to wait till you get here
[16:56] to start predestination you got to way
[16:59] do you get here to start the for
[17:00] knowledge into life see now he can sit
[17:05] back there and have it but yet see when
[17:08] you come down here remember what I kept
[17:10] trying to bring out if it's for
[17:13] knowledge then that means knowledge
[17:15] before but that means knowledge of what
[17:17] will
[17:20] be all right now but there never was a
[17:24] time of forn knowledge now listen cuz
[17:28] this this is on my mind so you know if
[17:31] if you get discontent with me for the
[17:33] next 10 or 15 messages then I'll just
[17:35] tell you right up front you don't have
[17:37] the Holy Ghost and and because you're if
[17:39] you get discontent then you don't have
[17:42] what I've got in my heart to try to
[17:43] bring to you so I'll just put it that
[17:45] way and then you get mad at me all right
[17:47] but I'm just honest to say it because
[17:51] you know if you say for knowledge
[17:54] remember for knowledge is God seeing
[17:57] what will happen here right but there is
[18:00] no for
[18:01] knowledge to
[18:04] attributes that's
[18:06] right all right I'm
[18:09] pausing when you're talking about
[18:11] attributes healer savior deliverer etc
[18:14] etc there was never a time that he
[18:16] didn't have that
[18:18] right so it wasn't a forn knowledge that
[18:20] he would have
[18:23] that oh man amen come on Amen come on
[18:27] see you're you're you're getting messed
[18:30] up in your point of for knowledge there
[18:33] was never a time that he didn't have
[18:34] them attributes his attributes is
[18:37] eternal and part of him well then there
[18:40] was not a time that he had a forn
[18:42] knowledge of having attributes right
[18:45] because that would mean he had a for
[18:46] knowledge of having something in a later
[18:48] event right he never had
[18:51] that he always had
[18:54] that for knowledge deals with when
[18:57] you're getting on down to the Earth ly
[18:59] journey and existence all right and see
[19:03] then let's let's just stay where we're
[19:07] at see then that point then we we've
[19:10] kept trying to bring
[19:12] out that we were not chosen of him or by
[19:16] him back before the
[19:19] world that would have to come over to
[19:21] the existence of
[19:23] time and this is not talking about
[19:26] people
[19:28] as little people running around up in
[19:32] heaven
[19:34] see see you you can't put us back there
[19:37] like
[19:40] that the only thing that can be back
[19:42] there is the attributes of God right
[19:45] that's right all right now if you put us
[19:47] back there that's pre-existence right
[19:51] and see that's what the Mormon Doctrine
[19:53] is that we were all up in
[19:55] heaven and decided to come to Earth
[19:58] right and see that won't uh that won't
[20:01] pan out you can't have pre-existence of
[20:05] souls reincarnation or or anything like
[20:10] that then you say but I've got a quote
[20:12] where brother R said All Souls before
[20:14] the world Amen that was in his mind
[20:18] amen
[20:21] amen see now that way we can cover the
[20:24] whole thing see and and and I've kept
[20:28] trying to make a point to
[20:33] you was Jesus chosen of
[20:39] God or was he God Amen that's right no
[20:43] sir right you see well he chose to do
[20:46] see all right that's coming on over here
[20:48] see you're not staying back up there
[20:50] with where I'm at in my my thought or
[20:54] idea did God choose for Jesus a son to
[20:57] come down and die die for us or did he
[21:00] choose to come himself
[21:06] amen see then if he chose to come
[21:08] himself the choice was not God choosing
[21:11] Jesus remember I I I kept emphasizing
[21:14] that where it said we were chosen in him
[21:17] in
[21:20] who who were we chosen in
[21:23] right we had to be chosen into Christ
[21:26] amen right right all right now and who
[21:30] are we chosen
[21:32] by is this a father choosing a
[21:38] family come on is this a father choosing
[21:41] a family you don't even do yours that
[21:44] way no right your natural existence
[21:48] never even come that way you didn't
[21:50] choose to have your
[21:53] children God's the one that's for
[21:55] ordained it toward be redheaded
[21:56] blackheaded green whatever it is
[22:01] know all right but you see amen he
[22:05] didn't
[22:07] choose a son to come and die he became
[22:10] that son that was his
[22:13] choice that was his choice to do that
[22:17] all right see then keep that in mind his
[22:20] choice is what ordained everything to be
[22:25] right okay see then we were chosen in in
[22:28] him into
[22:31] Christ all
[22:33] right and that the
[22:36] attributes all right now the only part
[22:39] of us that could ever exist before the
[22:42] world would only be the eternal life
[22:46] that we have right all
[22:49] right now that's sensual that that
[22:51] doesn't need a a bang Wing over the head
[22:53] to make you get a revelation that's
[22:55] sensible
[22:58] if you try to make anything existence
[23:00] how you going to make him
[23:02] Elohim self existing amen amen or
[23:07] existing
[23:10] alone you're going to start putting
[23:12] little something there and that's what
[23:15] all the people the message like the two
[23:16] Soul peoples and the thing they want to
[23:18] draw out these things put dots in and
[23:20] you're this you're that you're this
[23:21] you're that you know oh it makes a
[23:23] beautiful
[23:24] picture yeah but what good is a picture
[23:27] if it don't fit the
[23:29] right a cow up in a a beautiful you know
[23:34] cow up in a tree eating leaves off the
[23:37] tree that's oh that's a beautiful
[23:40] picture you got the cow you got the
[23:42] leaves you got the grass oh that's
[23:44] wonderful no right the cow's up in the
[23:48] tree see something's out of order amen
[23:51] all right that's what we've done with
[23:52] the word of God our thoughts has put it
[23:55] together to make a
[23:57] picture and when it comes out it doesn't
[23:59] exist in the right order all right right
[24:03] now we were chosen in him and he is the
[24:10] word that's why I I'd like to spend a
[24:13] while on that scripture because it
[24:15] really just opened up the other day to
[24:17] me and and see then there's been so much
[24:19] argument even the people of the message
[24:20] don't like it where in John one your
[24:23] Scholars are scholar type of people in
[24:25] the message they don't like John one
[24:27] where it said you know in the beginning
[24:29] was a word and word was with
[24:32] God they don't like that word with I
[24:34] love it amen cuz the only way to explain
[24:37] it amen amen amen the word was with God
[24:42] but the next verse ISS what and the Word
[24:44] was God Amen that's right so it's not a
[24:47] width of two people
[24:48] standing but it's a width of the bases
[24:51] that see you and I were with
[24:54] him but in him right
[24:59] we wasn't with him as people standing
[25:03] there Jesus wasn't with him as another
[25:06] person standing there or even the forms
[25:08] and never was used in existence until it
[25:11] was
[25:13] needed of the word the theop etc etc
[25:16] sort of God you know coming down see and
[25:20] see we were with
[25:22] him but we were ining that's right amen
[25:26] now if you don't get nothing out of the
[25:28] me message tonight you get one point I'm
[25:30] not not talking about choosing now we'll
[25:31] pick that up more um probably the Lord
[25:34] willing Sunday but I want your thoughts
[25:36] to stay
[25:37] on
[25:40] that if we have eternal
[25:44] life then that eternal life is the only
[25:49] thing and I hate to call it a thing CU
[25:51] it's a person right there the only thing
[25:54] that is eternal amen right is God's life
[25:59] that's right and see if we have God's
[26:01] own life in
[26:04] us then the life we have in
[26:09] us always was eternal now there's the
[26:12] argument of the people of the message a
[26:14] lot of them believe that oh we come here
[26:16] with eternal
[26:18] life well then how could we have eternal
[26:22] life and us
[26:24] sinners
[26:25] amen they make an eternal sinner that's
[26:28] not even sensible Amen brother Dale
[26:31] you're not supposed to be sensible it's
[26:33] Revelation well if Revelation won't fit
[26:35] the word of God Amen it's not a
[26:38] revelation
[26:40] amen what I said if you don't like it
[26:42] for me to keep repeating over then you
[26:45] don't know what I'm talking about go
[26:48] pray right and ask God to reveal to you
[26:50] what's brother de trying to say amen he
[26:53] been on it long enough but here's the
[26:55] what the thing that we'll hold if we can
[26:57] tonight
[27:00] if you wouldn't part of
[27:03] him before the
[27:05] world you'll never be part of
[27:10] him if we wasn't part of that eternal
[27:15] life we will never be part of him
[27:19] amen how can you make
[27:22] it Adam was
[27:24] impartation amen that's it he received
[27:27] eternal life impartation that's right he
[27:29] never went through to make him a a
[27:32] member of the body of Christ
[27:35] right do we call him a Son of God
[27:38] yes but not to bring him to be a member
[27:41] of the body of Christ cuz that could
[27:44] only come on the day of Pentecost
[27:48] amen and see then those that are given
[27:51] eternal life at the white throne and
[27:53] things like that they will not be a
[27:55] member of the body of Christ that's
[27:57] right they'll not be his
[28:01] wife so then going be by impartation
[28:05] amen so there's a lot of difference in
[28:07] impartation and actually going through
[28:10] an
[28:12] experience that's why the disciples
[28:14] couldn't receive the they could go
[28:16] through justification sanctification
[28:19] that's
[28:19] right I can even show you where that was
[28:21] only potential because it couldn't be a
[28:24] a full point until Pentecost was was was
[28:29] made possible Right even your Prophet
[28:32] said it was just potential
[28:35] right but you see they couldn't get
[28:38] eternal life right until Jesus Christ
[28:42] died because the eternal life was in
[28:46] them right now by
[28:50] predestination
[28:51] sure Jesus was walking in
[28:55] them that's where our trouble is see we
[28:58] want to make Adam coming in
[29:03] Eve that's not the way it is it was Eve
[29:05] was in
[29:07] Adam our the teaching of most people
[29:11] makes Jesus coming in us as he would
[29:13] come into the world cuz if you came into
[29:15] the world with eternal life then Jesus
[29:17] would have to be in you cuz he's your
[29:18] only s of eternal life
[29:22] amen but see if you believe it correctly
[29:25] and see he could come here with me and
[29:27] him
[29:30] now that's the only part I'm talking
[29:31] about is what was in him of me and what
[29:35] is that that's that eternal
[29:41] life or else you're dealing by
[29:43] impartation
[29:45] see and it won't work you're you're
[29:48] going into the wrong way
[29:50] see so now
[29:55] listen we know the first thing that went
[29:57] out of God God was an
[30:02] attribute what else you going to call it
[30:05] and You' call it the
[30:07] word the
[30:09] seed all right now your Prophet says
[30:13] Church age book what is it one what 154
[30:18] Church age book it's not the person that
[30:20] comes predestinated eternally from God
[30:23] amen amen it's the seed our word right
[30:27] all right so let's don't deal with a
[30:29] person of this what you're looking at
[30:32] none of the things that you can see and
[30:35] none of the actions or reactions that
[30:37] you could see by this individual could
[30:40] be back there before the world
[30:43] right because you can't see eternal
[30:47] life you agree
[30:49] right you you can't see it you can see
[30:53] manifestations yeah but you can't see
[30:55] eternal life you can't even see my
[30:57] spirit cuz I can deceive you right in my
[31:00] spirit tonight I can be as as hard as
[31:02] can be and deceive you into thinking
[31:04] that I know what I'm talking about and
[31:07] see that's why you got to have the Holy
[31:08] Spirit if you don't have eternal life
[31:10] you don't know what I'm talking about am
[31:13] you never will know what I'm talking
[31:14] about until you get eternal life right
[31:17] so eternal life is the most important
[31:18] thing in the world
[31:21] Amen a lot of head knowledge is fine but
[31:24] we need a lot of Holy Ghost knowledge
[31:28] okay first quote what do we got now I
[31:31] don't think Joe put the the things that
[31:34] we got it identified and we're going to
[31:36] have to figure out a way to be able to
[31:38] to uh and I know they can do it so we'll
[31:40] have to figure out how the way cuz
[31:42] you'll know that I just jump in and well
[31:44] maybe it starts down here okay now he's
[31:46] got it where we all right there above me
[31:49] can everybody read
[31:51] it you don't when I give my
[31:54] glasses you know but look what he said
[31:58] now on a message called uh
[32:00] identification preached in not
[32:02] identified Christ of all ages preached
[32:04] in
[32:05] 1964 uh
[32:07] 401 this is the first paragraph now look
[32:09] what it
[32:10] says he is now in
[32:14] you you are his
[32:17] attributes if you've got eternal
[32:20] life your life always was amen and you
[32:26] was God's thinking yep the color of your
[32:29] heart whatever you are you was God's
[32:33] thinking and what and you're just
[32:37] materialized amen now you're not talking
[32:39] about just coming in the world cuz watch
[32:41] the rest of
[32:42] it and that's what God was when he was
[32:45] materialized in
[32:47] Christ so they not just talking about us
[32:50] coming into the
[32:51] world
[32:53] right he's talking about what we are in
[32:57] eternal etal
[33:00] life where're the Christ amen cuz it's
[33:03] the only way to have eternal life amen
[33:05] see so then as he is just he was
[33:08] materialized see you're just
[33:10] materialized what happened the new birth
[33:12] brought us into a position to where that
[33:14] we're
[33:16] materialized he said just like Jesus
[33:20] was that's what was Jesus the alive word
[33:23] amen
[33:24] right eternal life in human flesh all
[33:27] right so then we that's just a point see
[33:31] all right so then what are
[33:35] we
[33:37] now what are
[33:41] we we're his
[33:43] offspring
[33:45] right but let's get to the number
[33:48] two which is believest thou this
[33:51] preached in 1950 716 paragraph
[33:55] E15 right and what does it
[33:59] say
[34:01] remember Jesus had all the qualities of
[34:04] the father in
[34:06] him do you believe that sure he did all
[34:11] the fine gifts of God was in Christ his
[34:13] son for he was The
[34:16] Offspring of God
[34:19] right now Jesus was The Offspring of
[34:24] God what is an offspring
[34:29] now this the only thing I I have to ask
[34:31] you to do is is when I get through with
[34:33] the quote and I stop you look this way
[34:35] you get looking over there you're not
[34:36] listening to me you're reading that's
[34:39] why I underline it okay so you keep on
[34:42] reading you're trying to if you need it
[34:43] we'll be glad to give you the quotes you
[34:45] know but we're doing our best cuz see
[34:48] all we could do is we could do like most
[34:49] people do most people you know what they
[34:51] do they give you the title they give you
[34:52] this quote yeah you would have nothing
[34:55] to read I don't choose to do those
[34:57] things like that because I want you to
[35:00] see before and be after but I want you
[35:02] to get back this way when we get the
[35:05] quote made all right so then listen he
[35:10] was The Offspring of
[35:13] God now how was Jesus a Son of
[35:21] God how was Jesus a Son of God and
[35:26] remember now we're still back before the
[35:29] world
[35:30] right so we know the flesh Jesus wasn't
[35:33] standing there so bring that then come
[35:37] down to where he comes to the
[35:39] earth now how was he The Offspring of
[35:46] God because he was God
[35:50] Amen an offspring of
[35:53] God is God in another form right amen
[35:57] amen
[35:59] right are you following me
[36:01] amen you are The Offspring of your
[36:05] mother and
[36:06] father now you're not an
[36:09] offspring of your mother and father and
[36:11] a
[36:13] neighbor you understand it right there's
[36:16] not four or five people involved in this
[36:18] situation got you
[36:20] here so then a word
[36:24] Offspring it doesn't mean someone
[36:27] adopted into the
[36:31] family it doesn't mean any of those
[36:33] terms it means a direct
[36:39] descendant and the basis that that
[36:41] person is now increasing his own uh uh
[36:47] he he's dividing
[36:51] himself
[36:52] right and then you're an
[36:56] offspring h
[36:58] so then Jesus was not a second
[37:02] person amen he was almighty God Amen
[37:05] that's right see he was not as I said
[37:08] when we started that that God would say
[37:10] I'll send my son down no we don't
[37:14] believe that do we how many of you
[37:15] quotes you needed that where brother R
[37:17] said he came
[37:19] himself well you're just
[37:22] Oneness well you just come up here and
[37:24] explain it
[37:27] that's all I've asked of
[37:30] anybody I'm not trying to be sarcastic
[37:33] or hate I just ask you to explain it
[37:35] some other
[37:38] way either Jesus was almighty
[37:42] God or he was a second person y if he's
[37:46] a second person one of them's got to be
[37:48] the devil cuz you the only way you go in
[37:50] the Bible and have two people one of
[37:51] them got to be the
[37:53] devil cuz it God can't be
[37:56] two around said that even that Jesus was
[37:59] not the second person listen he said
[38:02] he's not even the first
[38:05] person you need that quote he said he is
[38:09] the
[38:12] person well you're just an old Oneness
[38:15] that's old Oneness Doctrine well I wish
[38:17] you would come and show me
[38:20] then because there's not a Oneness
[38:23] person in the country can handle the way
[38:25] the prophet brought it amen that's right
[38:28] because he could move that almighty God
[38:31] over into another form called the word
[38:34] theophany L God speech Etc amen and let
[38:39] that be the
[38:40] Creator and let it it let it communicate
[38:46] back with almighty
[38:50] God if you think that's
[38:52] Oneness I'd like to hear you cuz see a
[38:56] true Oneness would say oh God poured
[38:59] into Jesus ain't no God right
[39:02] y That's why I'm against that quote that
[39:05] what people uses it not to quote brother
[39:06] around he made exactly right amen but
[39:10] see we say all God was he poured into
[39:11] Christ you're just doing away with all
[39:13] of
[39:14] God then you say all Christ pour in the
[39:16] church you just don't away with Christ
[39:17] ain't nothing but me and you and that's
[39:19] the devil's tactics to try to make us
[39:22] believe we're God right right in the
[39:25] wrong way right I'm not trying to make
[39:28] you believe you're
[39:30] God now get that out of your head that
[39:33] brother Dale is trying to convince you
[39:35] that you're
[39:36] God no I'm trying to show you you're God
[39:40] right amen that's right if you have a
[39:44] new birth tonight your God made manifest
[39:46] in flesh that's right yes sir it's not
[39:49] something that you're trying to make
[39:50] somebody
[39:52] something God is the only one that can
[39:55] make you anything amen
[39:59] we're it's God expanding himself amen
[40:02] that's
[40:05] right and he'll never go back is what I
[40:08] love about
[40:10] him God started there before the world
[40:13] to expand himself out into the word form
[40:16] and the thing and as that come forth we
[40:19] begin to see ourselves there and as we
[40:21] do then he finally comes down here and
[40:23] then we become his offspring here and
[40:26] you know what he never goes back to
[40:27] being self-existing
[40:30] oh what a wonderful
[40:32] God he never does away with any them
[40:34] attributes amen he just come right back
[40:36] to where he's at and and he'll stand
[40:38] there and look at his attributes and see
[40:40] them that's right
[40:42] amen I'm not trying to get you to
[40:44] believe your God I'm trying to get you
[40:46] to believe what God says about you
[40:53] right are you listening right see
[40:58] he was The Offspring of
[41:01] God look at the next
[41:03] one they identified Masterpiece of God
[41:06] 1964
[41:10] 1205 so we got basically the whole
[41:12] paragraph
[41:15] see now we notice that God began to make
[41:18] him a a bride for Christ so and the
[41:22] bride must be identified with
[41:24] him and in him
[41:27] now watch's your
[41:29] Prophet identified with
[41:31] him and in
[41:33] him see we we're you know we're real
[41:37] good to uh want to say we can take the
[41:40] Bible and and dissect it to the m that
[41:44] we make sure we get all of the little
[41:45] wording right but get brother brandham
[41:48] and watch his
[41:49] wording and you'll realize that somebody
[41:54] else was doing the wording because a
[41:58] seventh grade education man couldn't do
[42:03] it he wouldn't have that thought right
[42:07] there so you're identified with him and
[42:10] in him why because he is a part because
[42:15] it is a part of
[42:17] him you're talking about the bride okay
[42:21] now the bride is part of him she is part
[42:24] of him the word for that day that's
[42:27] right that's it's not the person that
[42:29] comes predestinated Eternal Word of seed
[42:33] okay the bride becomes part of that word
[42:36] for it's
[42:39] Christ that's why brother R said if you
[42:41] read in the Bible and don't see Christ
[42:42] and never verse he didn't say if you
[42:44] don't see Jesus in never verse he said
[42:45] if you don't see Christ in never verse
[42:46] go back and read it again amen see we're
[42:49] the
[42:50] Christ all
[42:52] right the Bible he calls it the Christ
[42:54] of God for him now and you believe that
[42:57] congregation says amen we have to be in
[43:01] Christ and watch him I read these before
[43:03] you know in Christ we have to be of
[43:08] Christ in Christ part of Christ
[43:13] right that's wonderful isn't it amen
[43:16] what does a woman when she takes a man
[43:17] or a man takes a woman that woman has to
[43:19] be part of him there are no longer two
[43:22] they're one that's where the trouble is
[43:23] is when they're two yeah right
[43:27] I bless God I'll be the I'm going to be
[43:29] the boss well you going to go wrong on
[43:32] either side so what does he
[43:36] say and when God in Christ became
[43:40] one they were
[43:44] one because God was the word and the
[43:48] Word was made
[43:50] flesh the Flesh and the word became one
[43:53] and when the church becomes Christ's
[43:56] bride
[43:58] she and the gospels are the same amen
[44:02] how can you say then the days of
[44:04] Miracles is
[44:07] pass see part of
[44:11] him I'm not talking about anything that
[44:13] I'm talking about part of him I'm
[44:15] talking about eternal life not talking
[44:18] about me and you as Body Spirit
[44:24] Soul I'm not talking about any Earthly
[44:26] part of us in our
[44:29] journey I'm talking about eternal life
[44:33] amen there is only one form of eternal
[44:37] life that is God's own life
[44:40] amen all right now I've told you over
[44:43] and over I don't believe we come in the
[44:44] world with eternal life I believe you
[44:46] must receive eternal life after you get
[44:48] here amen all right now we get to that
[44:51] way on down the road but to those that's
[44:52] listening to make sure you don't go me
[44:54] in the wrong
[44:55] way I don't believe you you come into
[44:57] the world with eternal life make an
[44:58] eternal sinner right and I won't even
[45:01] fit nowhere in the Bible except the
[45:03] devil and his ideas amen all right but
[45:07] you
[45:08] see a part of
[45:11] God the Eternal life that you have has
[45:15] to be a part of God's life right you
[45:19] agree
[45:21] amen all right so it cannot be Body
[45:24] Spirit and soul of a human being
[45:31] right CU if it was part of body spirit
[45:35] and soul then that put whatever it would
[45:37] be back
[45:41] there that's what I asked a man one time
[45:43] he was talking about it we were coming
[45:45] back down the road some of the brothers
[45:46] remember we were com back down the
[45:48] highway and this brother he he he he he
[45:50] was a two Soul kind of and going into
[45:53] those doings and and he is talking about
[45:55] us with eternal life I asked him one
[45:57] simple question I said where was the
[45:58] eternal life was it in your body was it
[46:00] in your spirit or was it in your
[46:04] soul he said I'm not going to answer
[46:07] that he knew better do you know what I
[46:11] done I shut up but you know what they
[46:14] have two or three brothers in that car
[46:16] they got on to him and you know what
[46:18] when we got down to where he lived at he
[46:20] wanted out of the car he was willing to
[46:23] walk a little piece if necessary amen
[46:26] cuz I didn't say no more to it that I
[46:27] just ask him one simple
[46:33] question CU it just won't work out all
[46:36] right let's go on
[46:39] now so brother randomman what God's
[46:41] provided place of worship 19 65
[46:44] 4:25 now you read all up and down while
[46:46] you looking at it but look at what he's
[46:48] saying now we are seated together in
[46:51] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus all
[46:54] right
[46:57] okay are we on the same one okay now
[46:59] wait a minute 65 425
[47:03] paragraph 137 yeah it's got to be in
[47:06] there somewhere now we're already
[47:07] resurrected Dynamics mechanics I'm going
[47:09] down into the to the quote I'm going
[47:12] down to where that I got what's
[47:13] underline now we are seated together in
[47:16] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus in
[47:19] Christ Jesus sitting in there that great
[47:23] seat that's already fired up been raised
[47:27] from the dead we're a part of it and if
[47:31] you're a part of the
[47:32] Bride you are because the bride is part
[47:37] of the groom you
[47:39] know she's part of the
[47:42] groom see now we we
[47:47] humanly we don't look at that that in
[47:50] that form do
[47:52] we I mean even as the the oldest ones in
[47:55] here are being married the longest I I
[47:56] guess is Dick and Gil UH 60 what I mean
[48:00] 5 56 that's just 53 see you're still two
[48:07] people the best you can talk about it's
[48:10] you're two
[48:11] people right and and the best you can do
[48:14] you have two people with two
[48:16] ideas right but that's not so in the
[48:20] body of Christ that's right see that's a
[48:24] natural to top to spiritual
[48:29] so then it it's not so that we have
[48:32] become one so much until we don't have
[48:35] no different
[48:37] thoughts that's only an example right
[48:41] but see in the body of Christ the bride
[48:45] and the groom is the
[48:48] same that's what I said we've got to
[48:50] cover and it's hard to cover things
[48:52] because we are a
[48:55] body right we're the body of
[48:59] Christ parts and difference and
[49:01] everything we're the body of Christ
[49:03] we're the bride of Christ that's
[49:07] another form of using right we're his
[49:13] wife we've got many things to look at
[49:17] but yet look at it what the scriptures
[49:24] say in this situation
[49:27] it's not a
[49:29] groom you know in the scriptural
[49:32] situation of Christ in his church it's
[49:34] not a groom and a bride as two different
[49:40] people so you you got the wrong concept
[49:48] right it it it it can't exist as groom
[49:51] and bride is two different people not in
[49:53] scriptural terminologies of the body of
[49:55] Christ cuz we are the body of Christ
[49:58] right members in particular where that
[50:00] body amen he's the head right but yet
[50:04] he's in every member of that
[50:08] body the only thing that you can think
[50:11] of or in any form to bring it out is
[50:13] this human
[50:17] terminologies he's the groom we're the
[50:21] bride all right so it means when we get
[50:24] there
[50:27] all right now watch if you don't get it
[50:29] all together what have you got when we
[50:32] get there if he's the the the the groom
[50:35] and we're the
[50:36] rde when we get there they just be two
[50:39] people standing
[50:42] there come
[50:45] on he's the groom we're the
[50:48] bride there'd only be two
[50:51] people but that's not true
[50:57] and neither is it a head hanging over
[50:59] here and a body hanging over
[51:02] here it's just a way of expressing
[51:08] something when we get
[51:10] there we'll be like him the Bible
[51:14] says we'll be as him you know what it'll
[51:17] be when we get there he'll be standing
[51:19] there you know what he'll have a many
[51:21] membered bride y amen many people will
[51:25] be standing there
[51:27] right and it's typed better by saying
[51:30] that David was a man one man and he had
[51:34] a thousand
[51:36] wives right
[51:39] right but you know what none of them
[51:42] wives could have another husband right
[51:45] right right but now what did David have
[51:49] see our human Minds David didn't have a
[51:51] th wives
[51:56] come
[51:58] on every one of them was his wife right
[52:01] right
[52:04] wife he was only typing
[52:07] right give you an
[52:09] example each one of them women was his
[52:12] wife
[52:14] right right and how you going to TP the
[52:17] body of Christ if you don't do these
[52:19] things right but you see we just go oh
[52:21] boy that's right well he's the ride
[52:23] we're the groom oh we're the ride he's
[52:25] the when we get there there'll be
[52:26] millions of us running around over here
[52:29] now how you going to bring that if it's
[52:31] just bride and gr I'm sorry I don't mean
[52:34] to be you know just Tire up little
[52:36] bubbles I just mean to try to preach the
[52:39] gospel to where it can be understood
[52:41] that's
[52:43] right when we get there he'll be
[52:45] standing there and there'll be a many
[52:47] membered bride standing there with him
[52:49] right you know what eternal life will be
[52:52] in him eternal life will be in every one
[52:54] of them am that's right they'll be just
[52:57] as Eternal as he is brother R said you
[52:59] receive the new birth he said as far as
[53:01] your soul is concerned you're just as
[53:03] Eternal you're just as perfect as God is
[53:08] amen you agree amen because that's what
[53:12] he's made
[53:13] you so didn't get that away they we're
[53:16] just Grooms and brides and parts and see
[53:18] now watch the next one what is
[53:21] it God's provided place of worship 1965
[53:25] 425 getting down what we got underline
[53:27] he's talking coming down said that's in
[53:30] Christ Jesus and today oh how today that
[53:35] I would that everybody would see that
[53:39] see how to get in being
[53:42] baptized the bride is part of her
[53:46] husband the church is a part of the
[53:50] word right the manifestation
[53:54] mhm so now you got a part of the
[53:57] husband the quote before you had part of
[54:00] the groom and the bride now you've got a
[54:04] husband that's literally
[54:09] in his
[54:12] bride you see where we got to keep it in
[54:14] the right order to understand that's
[54:16] right if you talk about eternal life
[54:18] where we going to go oh but brother Dale
[54:19] I don't care about what you're stand
[54:20] there with you oh I just I just BR
[54:23] preaching I just feel so good well amen
[54:29] but
[54:30] remember the prophet said it doesn't
[54:32] matter how high you
[54:35] shout make sure you walk straight and
[54:37] you come down
[54:39] amen make sure you know what you're
[54:41] talking about you know when you get back
[54:43] down you know and walk in it so I gave
[54:46] you the scripture there in Acts 17:29
[54:48] where it says for as much Paul was
[54:49] talking to them at uh you know they're
[54:52] on Mars Hill for as much then as we are
[54:54] The Offspring of God mhm we ought not to
[54:59] think that the godhead is lik UN the
[55:01] gold or silver or stone Graven by Art
[55:06] and man's devices why is it that you
[55:08] ought not to
[55:10] think read it why is it you ought not to
[55:13] think about the godhead being anything
[55:17] right you know gold silver Etc et why is
[55:20] it you not think that
[55:26] he gave you to
[55:28] keep he said we're The
[55:31] Offspring we're not gold
[55:34] silver right whatever he is we are
[55:38] right so you see what he's saying see
[55:41] the
[55:42] scripture
[55:44] see then if we are The Offspring of God
[55:46] we are not even think about the godhead
[55:48] being any other thing amen right let the
[55:53] word that's right righten
[55:56] wasn't the one that said it go to uh
[55:59] unveiling of God Mighty God unveiled and
[56:01] listen to the prophet say that the bride
[56:03] is the fullness of the godhead bodily
[56:05] amen I didn't make those statements he
[56:10] did you
[56:13] see I'm just trying to get you to look
[56:15] at
[56:17] something look what he says now on the
[56:19] next one 1963 God God hiding himself in
[56:22] Simplicity which is and then revealing
[56:24] himself in the same there you know words
[56:26] God Simplicity 1963
[56:29] 317 on that
[56:32] side he's talking about the CM then then
[56:35] we failed Etc and come down he said on
[56:37] that side he's the son of
[56:39] God he's an offspring of God I now don't
[56:44] count discount the fact that when he
[56:45] comes over here what we
[56:47] are he's an
[56:49] inheritance of the earth that's right
[56:52] see now he's bringing us over here he
[56:54] can control nature he can speak into
[56:57] existence why he's a Creator
[57:01] himself he's an offspring of
[57:06] God what is an offspring of
[57:10] God was Jesus another
[57:13] God was he a Son of
[57:16] God God being another person him being
[57:20] another person or two or whatever who
[57:22] was he God made manifest in the form
[57:25] called a son who are we God make
[57:28] manifest in a form called a bride that's
[57:30] right
[57:31] amen amen the children The Offspring of
[57:34] God so I want you to get this that's
[57:37] what I'm going to take these things it's
[57:38] like Offspring then we'll go into to to
[57:41] another one on Tuesday then we'll go
[57:42] into another one on on uh uh Joel I mean
[57:46] uh job and and where were you when the
[57:48] Morning Star saying together I said we
[57:50] have the answer now that job couldn't
[57:51] even have the answer to right
[57:56] I know where we
[58:00] were all right so what is
[58:05] he he's an offspring from
[58:10] God now remember what we've been in the
[58:13] scriptures in Romans
[58:16] 8 that we've been talking about that by
[58:21] the new
[58:22] birth that we become the children of God
[58:27] right and by doing it the scripture then
[58:29] says that we're
[58:31] ours join
[58:35] ours with Jesus Christ
[58:39] amen so if you want to go along with the
[58:41] big old brother up north up there that
[58:43] says that Jesus was just one half of God
[58:47] go right
[58:48] ahead but I still love it because that
[58:51] make me a half of
[58:53] God that's a whole lot better than what
[58:55] I used to
[59:00] right that's right I'd be happy about
[59:03] being high wouldn't
[59:05] you but want be a half when we can have
[59:08] the
[59:09] whole how can you explain it how can you
[59:13] explain that
[59:15] Jesus that we could be joint
[59:18] HS how can you explain that that's right
[59:21] amen the only way you can explain that
[59:23] is what God was in Jesus Christ that's
[59:26] right and God is in you amen how else
[59:30] can you explain that's right
[59:32] amen what else can you
[59:39] say where we
[59:43] at look what he says about 1954 1212 he
[59:48] swore by himself PRI in
[59:52] Jeffersonville he's talking about coming
[59:54] down and and Jesus and the signs and the
[59:56] followings and what he say why he became
[59:58] a part of him yes sir God's on the
[1:00:02] instance of deliver in deliver
[1:00:06] anything he'll make a way when there's
[1:00:09] no way he makes a way in any man that
[1:00:13] believes in him because the same
[1:00:17] thing he has to he's a part of God he's
[1:00:22] an offspring of God he's a Son of God or
[1:00:25] a daughter of God and he can do nothing
[1:00:29] else because he's God because he's God's
[1:00:33] right with him he's just a
[1:00:36] portion of
[1:00:39] God now if I misread some of this you
[1:00:41] put it in the place it's supposed to be
[1:00:43] I just do the best I can my education I
[1:00:45] try to read the way brother around and
[1:00:47] saying right he's a part of let
[1:00:50] something make sure I read it and any
[1:00:52] man that believes in Him believes the
[1:00:54] same thing he has to
[1:00:56] he's a part of God he's an offspring of
[1:00:59] God he's a Son of God or a daughter of
[1:01:01] God and he can't do nothing else because
[1:01:04] he's God's right with him because God's
[1:01:07] right with him he's just a portion of
[1:01:11] God what is it amen a portion of God I'd
[1:01:16] be
[1:01:17] happy wouldn't
[1:01:19] you if I come through all of this world
[1:01:23] and I got down the end of it
[1:01:26] and I found out that all I was going to
[1:01:27] do was get eternal life I'd be happy
[1:01:30] wouldn't
[1:01:32] you but you see that's not so with the
[1:01:34] bride amen she already has eternal
[1:01:38] life if you're born again tonight you
[1:01:40] already have cuz what will you do you'll
[1:01:42] do just like what he said now look at
[1:01:44] the next
[1:01:45] 1955 uh 610 I guess it is I had to cut
[1:01:48] the top off of that and then say do you
[1:01:50] now
[1:01:53] believe he believed in his own
[1:02:00] word and if a man's born of the spirit
[1:02:03] of
[1:02:04] God he's an offspring of
[1:02:08] God and that part of God is in him and
[1:02:12] he believes every word that God says
[1:02:15] will
[1:02:16] materialize and so that makes him part
[1:02:20] of God the holy spirit in the man makes
[1:02:24] him a part of God
[1:02:28] a part of
[1:02:31] God are these just idle quotes to
[1:02:36] you or is it a prophet telling you who
[1:02:39] you are
[1:02:41] amen that's why I said if it's not
[1:02:43] important to you it's idle
[1:02:45] quotes but if it's God telling you who
[1:02:48] you are it's worth a lot right amen
[1:02:53] 1962 118 convinced in concerned and
[1:02:57] remember when you die and that Soul
[1:03:01] leaves you it never changes no sir death
[1:03:06] doesn't change the soul it changes its
[1:03:09] dwelling place but it's still the same
[1:03:13] Soul so if that Soul isn't born
[1:03:18] again and a part and a part of the
[1:03:22] eternal spirit of God it had a begin
[1:03:28] anything with a beginning has an end
[1:03:31] that's the reason God is the only thing
[1:03:34] is eternal unless you're born again and
[1:03:37] have eternal life the Greek word Zoe
[1:03:39] there means God's own life in you you'll
[1:03:44] perish but where God's life is in you
[1:03:48] you can no more perish then God can
[1:03:50] perish that's right because you are a
[1:03:54] son and offs of God and have eternal
[1:03:57] life oh that's the thing the church
[1:03:59] needs then when God is in you then he
[1:04:02] lives his own life through you so are
[1:04:05] you seeing what I'm talking about an
[1:04:08] offspring a part of
[1:04:12] God now if we're a part of God now we
[1:04:15] had to be a part of God back there
[1:04:17] right all right that's why I'm not
[1:04:20] talking about Body Spirit and soul of
[1:04:22] human
[1:04:23] moraly we'll get over to that bring it
[1:04:25] down to a new birth and the things you
[1:04:27] got to bring it all right we got to
[1:04:29] receive eternal life but I'm talking
[1:04:31] about back there if we wouldn't a part
[1:04:33] of God back there we're not going to be
[1:04:35] a part of God here that's
[1:04:37] right if we was not an offspring we
[1:04:39] won't be an offspring here we don't
[1:04:40] become an offspring we're are an
[1:04:42] offspring
[1:04:45] right that's why the scripture said it
[1:04:47] didn't make us that
[1:04:53] right the prophet of God should the you
[1:04:55] birth didn't make you a child of God
[1:04:57] right you said but what all right we'll
[1:04:59] get to that one later we had to receive
[1:05:01] the new birth
[1:05:03] right but it didn't make you Eternal
[1:05:06] because the eternal life is that new
[1:05:08] birth amen that's
[1:05:13] right come
[1:05:15] on Matthew 62 12:30 the evening service
[1:05:19] is this the sign of the end
[1:05:21] sir he gets on down and explaining it
[1:05:24] but there can't be an eternal hell
[1:05:26] because the Bible said hell was created
[1:05:29] how can it be created and be Eternal if
[1:05:32] there ever was the Bible said hell was
[1:05:34] created for the devil and his angels and
[1:05:36] then if it was created it can't be
[1:05:39] Eternal CU Eternal anything Eternal
[1:05:42] never had a beginning or an end now if
[1:05:47] you was
[1:05:51] created we're going to have to get to
[1:05:53] that one later I get okay better hold it
[1:05:56] watching that's how we can never die
[1:06:00] that's right because we was
[1:06:03] always now what's he talking
[1:06:10] about are we
[1:06:14] like and I'm sorry to even bring it up
[1:06:16] in a
[1:06:17] situation but are we like the
[1:06:22] uh latterday Saints man it just got
[1:06:25] through
[1:06:27] and they've tried him and give him life
[1:06:29] in
[1:06:30] prison you know
[1:06:32] what he believes he's a
[1:06:35] prophet they believe 10,000 followers
[1:06:38] they believe he's a prophet he's a split
[1:06:40] off cuz he's not of the main part of the
[1:06:43] the thing cuz there's many millions of
[1:06:45] those this is a little Spur off but it
[1:06:47] kind of has it but you know the the the
[1:06:51] Mormons Church of the latterday Saints
[1:06:54] they believe that they have prop
[1:06:56] coming down through time right and that
[1:07:00] Prophet is to come and tell them of the
[1:07:02] things that God wants man to know and if
[1:07:05] there's any changes whatsoever he can
[1:07:07] change the
[1:07:08] situation right all right and you see
[1:07:11] this guy he he had a bunch of young
[1:07:13] girls for his new little wed
[1:07:17] Brides because he believed and see he
[1:07:20] taught them right but that's the only
[1:07:22] way to have eternal life is for them to
[1:07:25] to do what he
[1:07:27] said y you see we believe in a prophet
[1:07:31] coming
[1:07:35] amen I can take brother br's message and
[1:07:38] prove to you anything you want me to
[1:07:40] prove in the way you want me to prove it
[1:07:42] right
[1:07:45] sure anything you tell me brother Brown
[1:07:48] told I can tell take you to brother
[1:07:49] brandham and show you where that he T
[1:07:52] seemingly contrary right
[1:08:00] amen are we just another latterday
[1:08:04] Saints
[1:08:07] on or are we the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:08:10] amen that is we set up above there he
[1:08:13] believes his own
[1:08:16] word Y and any child of God will take
[1:08:20] God's word above what any man tells him
[1:08:33] just listening last night to a
[1:08:36] tape and one just a few days
[1:08:38] before you remember the income tax case
[1:08:41] with brother brandom where that they he
[1:08:43] finally had to make a deal with them for
[1:08:45] $440,000 counting the lawyers fee and
[1:08:47] Etc and
[1:08:50] all and you know what he says and one
[1:08:52] time he says he went to one brother I
[1:08:55] won't call his name because it's on the
[1:08:57] tape but you can do and told the man
[1:09:00] that he needed to borrow the money and
[1:09:01] the man said I'll give it to
[1:09:04] you the man paid the
[1:09:07] $40,000 what he says we listening to him
[1:09:10] last night he said that a bunch of the
[1:09:13] brothers got together from the church
[1:09:15] and went down to the bank and
[1:09:17] borrowed the
[1:09:22] $4,000 anything you want brother Brandon
[1:09:24] I show you quote
[1:09:28] contrary they're arguing now whether he
[1:09:30] was out there
[1:09:31] hunting at a certain time and what was
[1:09:35] going
[1:09:37] on it's been argued all over the country
[1:09:40] where he was born again at was it in the
[1:09:42] Woodshed or was it here or was it there
[1:09:44] or where was it because it sounds like
[1:09:45] he's talking about about three or four
[1:09:47] different
[1:09:49] places but you
[1:09:51] see are we concerned with that or what
[1:09:54] he taught us in Bible that's right of
[1:09:57] what the word says that's right well he
[1:10:00] wasn't don't want to it was all
[1:10:03] right that's what it's in there for for
[1:10:06] you to fall off right
[1:10:10] amen he never taught but one true and
[1:10:12] living God never taught a trinity he
[1:10:14] said I'll show you a quot quote where he
[1:10:16] said let's stand and address the third
[1:10:18] person of the
[1:10:22] Trinity that's right
[1:10:28] anything but you
[1:10:30] see what has he done for you amen like
[1:10:34] brother dick says if he proved he had 40
[1:10:36] wives they wouldn't change what he's
[1:10:38] done to help him to understand God right
[1:10:41] right right he might not have said 40
[1:10:44] but he used a
[1:10:48] number see because you can always find
[1:10:52] what you want to find
[1:10:57] but what about eternal life amen see if
[1:11:00] we got eternal life who's going to worry
[1:11:02] about all of
[1:11:04] that this message has brought eternal
[1:11:07] life to
[1:11:08] me
[1:11:13] amen what about you this has brought a
[1:11:16] revelation of God to me amen what about
[1:11:20] you
[1:11:21] right well that's what a brother done
[1:11:24] just recently said brother BR was wrong
[1:11:26] said he said if he was wrong to get away
[1:11:28] and that's what I'm going to
[1:11:30] do
[1:11:34] okay listening to him the other day
[1:11:36] where he says those angels come down to
[1:11:38] him out there and he said not no more
[1:11:40] than
[1:11:45] five then he said no no no brother Dale
[1:11:48] he said but on this day he said not no
[1:11:50] more than five
[1:11:52] right on the others he said there was
[1:11:54] seven
[1:11:56] and you're going to go with just
[1:11:57] something like that and just die away
[1:12:00] because that that little something is
[1:12:05] not compatible in your mind or whatever
[1:12:08] You' want to call
[1:12:10] it sorry about
[1:12:12] that see if you have eternal
[1:12:20] life that's how we can we can never die
[1:12:24] because was
[1:12:26] always we're part of God The Offspring
[1:12:29] of God and he's the only Eternal thing
[1:12:32] that there is brother Brown knocks on
[1:12:34] the platform pullit three times amen you
[1:12:38] can no more die than God can die because
[1:12:41] you're Eternal with
[1:12:45] him what is
[1:12:48] it what about
[1:12:53] it all you need some kind of something
[1:12:56] to kill your influence
[1:13:00] right brother Dale you shouldn't bring
[1:13:02] out things or to kill people in it's not
[1:13:04] going to kill nobody that's born again
[1:13:06] that's right amen amen that's right and
[1:13:10] I don't mean to hurt nobody
[1:13:12] else and if you had it all put together
[1:13:15] so perfectly until that everything would
[1:13:18] be and it would never be a misquote
[1:13:22] anywhere ain't going to save nobody
[1:13:24] right
[1:13:27] Jesus Christ is only the Salvation there
[1:13:29] is right it's not the letter of the word
[1:13:33] right it's the Revelation to the heart
[1:13:41] right cuz when you get that Jorgenson
[1:13:44] book you'll read it you'll find out that
[1:13:45] his brother does a good job cuz brother
[1:13:48] Brandon was out there when he was
[1:13:49] hunting and it's been I've known that
[1:13:51] ever since I've been in the message that
[1:13:52] there was an argument about that thing
[1:13:56] and you'll get in ear brother does a
[1:13:57] good job expressing it and brother
[1:13:59] random was the the Angels the the
[1:14:02] picture that was taken of the cloud
[1:14:05] that's in the magazine was almost 1
[1:14:08] month prior to where brother Randon was
[1:14:10] out
[1:14:14] there but yet he sounds like it the
[1:14:17] angels went up and made the
[1:14:19] cloud no just the same Angels amen was
[1:14:24] no problem
[1:14:26] just the same
[1:14:28] Angels see but yet we can arue see right
[1:14:33] over those things and reject the
[1:14:38] word all right see this proves we don't
[1:14:41] have the Holy Ghost because God believes
[1:14:44] his word amen and if he's in you he'll
[1:14:46] believe his word that's right if he's
[1:14:48] given an opportunity let's continue
[1:14:51] on
[1:14:53] 1953 5
[1:14:56] 11 we have found him come and
[1:15:00] see he's talking about the the features
[1:15:03] about about your father and you look
[1:15:05] like your father and this that and the
[1:15:06] other and he's about the same size of
[1:15:08] his father and a whole lot of features
[1:15:09] and
[1:15:10] all because I'm an offspring of
[1:15:13] his and if I become an offspring of God
[1:15:16] In My Soul then my soul is liking
[1:15:19] something on the order of God it
[1:15:22] believes the supernatural it believes
[1:15:24] for everything see what I
[1:15:30] mean there's another story on there that
[1:15:32] people are on to things the doubting
[1:15:34] brother Brandon they said he got to come
[1:15:35] back and kill a brown
[1:15:41] bar said he said he kill
[1:15:44] it
[1:15:49] well the only thing I'll say is one
[1:15:52] thing are we going to bring a man back
[1:15:54] in the resurrection like they're saying
[1:15:56] he'll come back in the resurrection go
[1:15:58] across the country and preach and that
[1:16:00] Eternal man coming from the resurrection
[1:16:03] Eternal man will take a natural gun and
[1:16:05] go shoot a brown
[1:16:07] fire now that's all I'm saying right
[1:16:11] that you got an eternal man killing a
[1:16:13] brown bar see that's that's what people
[1:16:15] are they're based on all of that he's
[1:16:17] got to come back and do this well what
[1:16:19] if he comes back and do is is he going
[1:16:21] to be Eternal in body right amen
[1:16:25] and then you'll take a gun and why don't
[1:16:28] we do like this brother down here done
[1:16:30] when all that fell through that he
[1:16:31] passed on but he's supposed to kill that
[1:16:33] big old deer well they just started
[1:16:34] preaching he's going to get it in the
[1:16:36] Millennium well is he going to kill it
[1:16:37] in the Millennium no no no it's going to
[1:16:40] be with him well that wasn't what he
[1:16:42] said he said I'm going to kill a world
[1:16:45] record dear kill a world record there
[1:16:49] amen that's
[1:16:52] correct why not just go on and forgive
[1:16:55] it let everybody have what they want to
[1:16:57] okay 1954 1203 the law having a
[1:17:02] shadow a man must be born again by the
[1:17:04] spirit of God and then the the black
[1:17:07] spot on the tape Spirit of the Creator
[1:17:09] himself comes into the individual and
[1:17:11] claims relationship is sunship you see
[1:17:14] it then that person is an offspring of
[1:17:16] God and God who spoke the world's into
[1:17:20] existence and this man's an offspring of
[1:17:23] him he can believe anything
[1:17:25] all things are possible unto him for he
[1:17:28] believes he's a part of God he's a son
[1:17:31] or a daughter of God you believe in
[1:17:33] Divine yes sir go on down 64 1212 the
[1:17:36] Harvest time if you have eternal life
[1:17:39] there is only one form of eternal life
[1:17:43] and that's God's that's God so if we
[1:17:47] have eternal life we were with him right
[1:17:50] then a part of God we were his attribute
[1:17:55] we are now his attribute because in the
[1:17:58] beginning was the word
[1:18:01] right 1965
[1:18:04] 1119 God The God Who is rich in
[1:18:08] Mercy now if you got eternal life
[1:18:10] tonight if we have eternal life then we
[1:18:13] always were because there's only one
[1:18:15] form of eternal life we always were and
[1:18:19] the reason we were because we are a part
[1:18:23] of God and God is only only thing that's
[1:18:26] Eternal so now brother random is talking
[1:18:28] about eternal life he's not talking
[1:18:31] about you and I being before the world
[1:18:34] with God in some kind of a form or a
[1:18:37] person or whatever a soul or a spot or a
[1:18:40] DOT or whatever right if you if you Ain
[1:18:44] put a dot back there you've added to God
[1:18:47] come on how can you be self-existing if
[1:18:50] you can put a dot right
[1:18:57] come on drop on down the same message
[1:19:01] cuz we're still in that was paragraph 42
[1:19:03] this paragraph 44 now we are part of God
[1:19:06] you always was you don't remember it
[1:19:08] because you were only an attribute in
[1:19:10] God you were only in his thinking your
[1:19:14] very name if it ever was on the book of
[1:19:18] life was put there before the foundation
[1:19:20] of the world he knew what you were right
[1:19:24] keep on reading God's power to trans
[1:19:27] transform 65
[1:19:30] 911 Sons and Daughters were in God at
[1:19:33] the begin was in God at the beginning
[1:19:36] now look you've got eternal life you say
[1:19:40] well we believe it that we got eternal
[1:19:42] life well there's only one form of
[1:19:44] eternal life and that's God Amen that's
[1:19:47] the only thing that is eternal as God
[1:19:50] then if you got eternal life that life
[1:19:53] that's in you always was and you were in
[1:19:57] the loins of God before there ever was a
[1:20:00] world right and when the world itself
[1:20:02] Jesus himself is called the word and the
[1:20:04] St John 1 said in the beginning was the
[1:20:07] word and the Word was with God and the
[1:20:08] Word was God and the Word was made flesh
[1:20:11] and dwelt among us then we were in the
[1:20:13] loins of Jesus and when he went to
[1:20:16] Calvary and went to Calvary with him
[1:20:19] amen you died with him and you raised
[1:20:22] with him and today we're sitting in
[1:20:24] Heavenly places in him fill with his
[1:20:27] Spirit Sons and Daughters of God die
[1:20:29] with him raise with him sure go right on
[1:20:32] down reading same it's just a continual
[1:20:35] reading down below just another
[1:20:38] paragraph below now then now now you can
[1:20:41] fellowship with him you couldn't back
[1:20:44] there because you were just a word in
[1:20:47] him a seed but now he has manifested you
[1:20:52] and now he wants you to fellowship with
[1:20:54] him him then he came down and was made
[1:20:57] flesh so he could perfectly fellowship
[1:21:00] with you see the perfect Fellowship Oh
[1:21:02] my he talking about them deep Mysteries
[1:21:04] next paragraph Jesus Christ was God
[1:21:09] himself manifested because he was a son
[1:21:12] because he was
[1:21:13] begotten but it was just a tabernacle
[1:21:16] for him to live in now I got the quotes
[1:21:18] on
[1:21:19] that he's the only begotten
[1:21:24] the Bible says yep so we better be able
[1:21:27] to believe we was in him we'll get to
[1:21:29] that in another message CU he was the
[1:21:31] only begotten amen all right mod EV this
[1:21:35] made clear by prophecy 65
[1:21:37] 1206 now you're a gene of your father
[1:21:41] and you were in your father yet your
[1:21:43] father had no fellowship with you
[1:21:44] because he you was in there but you knew
[1:21:49] it not and he knew it not but you was
[1:21:53] manifested that you might that he might
[1:21:56] fellowship with
[1:21:58] you and you being born again you're born
[1:22:02] of eternal
[1:22:04] life and that's the only one form of
[1:22:07] eternal life and that's God's life Zoe
[1:22:10] the Greek word Zoe only one form of
[1:22:13] eternal life then if you are a son of
[1:22:16] God or a daughter of God you were in God
[1:22:19] all the
[1:22:21] time but he knew what bed and time that
[1:22:24] you'd be planted so now you made you're
[1:22:27] made a creature a Son of God manifested
[1:22:31] son or daughter of God to meet the
[1:22:32] challenge of this hour to vindicate the
[1:22:35] true and living God of this hour the
[1:22:37] message that's coming forth in this time
[1:22:40] that's right you was done there before
[1:22:44] the foundation of the world if it wasn't
[1:22:47] if you wasn't chose that way no matter
[1:22:49] how much you try to impersonate it
[1:22:52] you'll never make it
[1:22:54] all you believe him right no matter how
[1:22:57] much you try to
[1:23:00] impersonate leadership 1965 12 1207
[1:23:04] there's only one form of eternal life
[1:23:06] and that's that comes from God and he
[1:23:09] ordained every creature that would ever
[1:23:11] have it just as you were the gene in
[1:23:14] your father you was a gene in God one of
[1:23:18] his attributes to begin with are you'll
[1:23:21] never be there you come forth into
[1:23:24] betting ground of your mother your
[1:23:25] father didn't know you you were in his
[1:23:27] loins and when you come forth in the
[1:23:29] beding ground of the mother then you
[1:23:31] become a human being and are made in the
[1:23:33] image your of your father now you can
[1:23:35] fellowship with him the same thing by
[1:23:37] God if you got eternal life the life
[1:23:40] that you that you come in the Natural
[1:23:44] Life physical life that was by your
[1:23:46] father and the only way you can come can
[1:23:49] come born again is the only way now what
[1:23:52] the and the only way you can come born
[1:23:55] again is the only way it is it is it has
[1:23:59] to be your heavenly father his
[1:24:02] attributes all the father has given me
[1:24:04] will come to me you are here because
[1:24:07] your name was placed on the Lamb's Book
[1:24:09] of Life before there was even a
[1:24:11] foundation of the world that's exactly
[1:24:13] right you're a gene a spiritual Gene out
[1:24:17] of your heavenly father a part of God's
[1:24:20] word that be so as I said then you was
[1:24:25] with Jesus when he was here because he
[1:24:27] was the word you suffered with him died
[1:24:31] with him buried with him rose with him
[1:24:34] now sitting in Heavenly places in him
[1:24:38] right 65 11 11:25 the invisible unit of
[1:24:43] the bride of
[1:24:45] Christ if you're married to Christ
[1:24:48] Christ is the word of God in St John the
[1:24:50] first chapter in the beginning was the
[1:24:51] word and the word with God and the Word
[1:24:53] was God the same was made flesh and
[1:24:55] dwelt Among Us Christ was the Living
[1:24:58] Word he always was the word he is still
[1:25:02] the word he always will be the word he
[1:25:05] was only the manifestation of the
[1:25:07] attributes of God for he was the son of
[1:25:11] God and any son is the attributes of his
[1:25:14] father and just as you were in the genes
[1:25:17] of your father in the body of your
[1:25:20] father when you was young boy you were
[1:25:22] in him yet he could not have fellowship
[1:25:24] with with you because he didn't know you
[1:25:27] but then through the bedding grounds of
[1:25:29] a mother you were brought forth into the
[1:25:32] Earth and become in the image of your
[1:25:34] father then he could fellowship with you
[1:25:38] so and so were you sons of God and
[1:25:41] Daughters of God before there was a was
[1:25:45] a Moon Star or molecule you were Sons
[1:25:48] and Daughters of God for you you are
[1:25:51] only the physical manifestation
[1:25:54] of the attributes that was in God at the
[1:25:57] beginning right for there's only one
[1:25:59] form of eternal life and that was you
[1:26:02] before you don't know nothing about it
[1:26:05] neither did you know when you was in
[1:26:07] your Earthly father but you are
[1:26:09] manifested to In His Image in the image
[1:26:12] of God you are made and you were
[1:26:13] manifested for the glory and fellowship
[1:26:15] of God and therefore as sure as your
[1:26:18] Gene had to be in your father before
[1:26:21] your natural birth your spiritual Gene
[1:26:23] had to be in God because you're an
[1:26:25] expression of the attributes of his
[1:26:27] thoughts before the foundation of the
[1:26:29] world right now way around no way around
[1:26:33] it that's right that we'll notice then
[1:26:36] that life being in you God's life being
[1:26:39] in you from the foundation of the world
[1:26:42] let's get a couple more we got a little
[1:26:44] time 65 1205 things that are to
[1:26:48] be now the only way that you can be a
[1:26:52] son a daughter of God because because
[1:26:54] you have to be have to have eternal life
[1:26:57] now is that simple enough the only way
[1:26:59] you can be a child of God is to have
[1:27:00] eternal life simple language all
[1:27:04] right there's and there's only one form

[1:27:09] only one form of eternal life that was
[1:27:12] God there to be a Son of God you had to
[1:27:16] be in him always now watch what he said

[1:27:25] before there was even a molecu see you
[1:27:27] are nothing but the
[1:27:30] manifestation of the gene of life that
[1:27:32] was in God as the Son of
[1:27:35] God now you're expressed after his word
[1:27:38] has come in you to light up this age you
[1:27:41] are expressing God's life in you because
[1:27:44] you are a son or a daughter of God

[1:28:04] right wherever you are God knew that you
[1:28:07] would be here because you have to be one
[1:28:10] of his genes or his attributes you had
[1:28:14] to be if you ever if you got eternal
[1:28:16] life then it always was eternal life and
[1:28:20] God before there was a foundation World
[1:28:23] knew that you would be here and when the
[1:28:26] word or the water the washing of the
[1:28:28] water fell upon you you it was expressed

[1:29:09] Us the three stages it was an at was an
[1:29:12] attribute first was in God that he
[1:29:15] thought of himself as being human and
[1:29:17] that transmitted him down to be Jesus
[1:29:20] and now if you'll ever be there you was
[1:29:24] with him then for there's only one form
[1:29:27] of eternal life that's God and you had

[1:29:52] about how we chose to be a Christian
[1:29:58] and God honored that and saw you would
[1:30:01] want
[1:30:03] that we not doing away with anything the
[1:30:05] prophet taught already covered the
[1:30:07] message straight across now you need to
[1:30:10] go back go back and listen to that
[1:30:11] message again the other Wednesday night

[1:30:19] that same way all right on the message
[1:30:21] which would be page 284 of the church
[1:30:23] Church age book or sardian church
[1:30:28] age we have the same right today in the
[1:30:31] church names are going to be blotted out
[1:30:33] of the book of life no names will be
[1:30:35] blotted out of the book of eternal life
[1:30:37] for that is another record though
[1:30:39] contained in the book of life this is
[1:30:42] the record God hath given us eternal
[1:30:45] life amen and this life is in his son
[1:30:47] that's in the scripture what first John
[1:30:49] over in the the writing
[1:30:54] he that hath the son hath life eternal
[1:30:57] he that hath not the son hath not life
[1:31:00] eternal and those who have that life
[1:31:03] were in him before the foundation of the
[1:31:06] world they were chosen in him before the
[1:31:10] foundation of the world the great Royal
[1:31:12] seed Jesus Christ was planted he died
[1:31:15] and that life that was in him came up
[1:31:17] through the wheat plant and is re
[1:31:19] reproducing itself in M multitudes of
[1:31:22] wheat seeds having the same life in them
[1:31:25] and being like the original because
[1:31:28] right by Spirit they are
[1:31:31] original all right lot of f
[1:31:36] reading but go back and think about
[1:31:40] it if you have eternal
[1:31:44] life that eternal life always was
[1:31:47] eternal
[1:31:49] amen but did we come into the world with
[1:31:52] that eternal life in US
[1:31:57] if we did I'll just ask one question
[1:31:59] that's all I've ever asked if you think
[1:32:01] you come into the world anybody listen
[1:32:03] to this and you say I come into the
[1:32:04] world with eternal life I want to ask
[1:32:05] you one simple
[1:32:07] question what did Jesus Christ die far
[1:32:10] amen that's right yes
[1:32:16] sir what was his purpose
[1:32:19] Amen brother I got where the Prophet
[1:32:21] said that Jesus didn't give me eternal
[1:32:23] life
[1:32:26] glad you can
[1:32:30] read but you better read a whole lot
[1:32:38] more eternal life was in God before the
[1:32:41] world ever
[1:32:42] begun but that eternal life was in Jesus
[1:32:46] Christ that's right that's iten that was
[1:32:48] the only way to get it here to you and I
[1:32:51] right amen was for him that die to
[1:32:53] release it that's why in the Old
[1:32:55] Testament they could not have eternal
[1:32:58] life you say prove it Jesus Christ died
[1:33:03] for once for all amen that's right solve
[1:33:08] the case amen he died one time for all
[1:33:11] all of those back there look forward to
[1:33:14] Calvary we look back to Calvary right to
[1:33:18] see what took place amen eternal life is
[1:33:21] a person it's not a thought a concept an
[1:33:24] idea it's not joining a church it's not
[1:33:26] reading a prophet's message right it's
[1:33:29] not saying oh I I believe everything
[1:33:31] brother Brown says there's people that
[1:33:33] saying that that today ain't been in the
[1:33:36] church in 10 years probably they believe
[1:33:39] everything
[1:33:40] sure people are doing that that are
[1:33:42] married three or four times you know I'm
[1:33:44] talking about polygamy deals
[1:33:47] right do they believe everything brother
[1:33:50] around said
[1:33:54] what about
[1:33:57] it see I
[1:33:59] believe that back before the world the
[1:34:02] eternal life I
[1:34:04] have was a part of God
[1:34:07] right and it was just transmitted
[1:34:11] down through the fact of Jesus Christ
[1:34:14] dying to release it to where I could
[1:34:16] receive
[1:34:18] it and give me the new
[1:34:20] birth then I can squ with the Prophet I
[1:34:24] always was
[1:34:27] eternal why because the eternal life I
[1:34:31] have always was I'm a part of
[1:34:35] God now I'm going to try to end this Mak
[1:34:38] it as strong as I can make it let's
[1:34:41] still don't get the
[1:34:44] idea that predestination for knowledges
[1:34:48] and all of that doesn't have something
[1:34:49] to do with it
[1:34:50] sure let's still don't get the idea of
[1:34:54] that you know we don't have anything to
[1:34:58] do with
[1:34:59] anything we must receive eternal life
[1:35:02] that's right God will not override your
[1:35:05] freeo agency amen and make you take it
[1:35:08] that's right he will offer it unto you
[1:35:11] and you have a choice to receive right
[1:35:13] if your choice is that you receive it
[1:35:15] then it prove that he saw you before the
[1:35:18] world but remember we're back before the
[1:35:21] world talking about it amen I'm still
[1:35:24] back there talking about part of God I'm
[1:35:26] talking about chosen in
[1:35:29] him as being not a choosing like we
[1:35:33] decided something right or that he
[1:35:35] decided something M he didn't decide to
[1:35:39] have a family and then let all the rest
[1:35:42] of this come down here to just do some
[1:35:44] works out and do
[1:35:47] things his family was a part of it right
[1:35:55] prophet of God said where were you when
[1:35:57] the morning start saying together sons
[1:35:58] of God shout of Joy he said when they
[1:36:00] saw the Plan of Redemption come into
[1:36:01] view before the
[1:36:04] world well we had to be back car then
[1:36:08] amen but not as little people running R
[1:36:11] amen that's right yes sir not as Spirits
[1:36:14] he said was we Spirits he said no you
[1:36:16] would nothing you was in God's
[1:36:21] mind see
[1:36:26] we have a great message but what are we
[1:36:27] doing with
[1:36:29] it that's right eternal life is a person
[1:36:34] do you know that
[1:36:35] person right of eternal
[1:36:39] life that's the only one that can hold
[1:36:42] us in any time or whatsoever or keep us
[1:36:44] from falling into any false Doctrine is
[1:36:46] that person of eternal
[1:36:50] life cuz we're human Mortals dwelling in
[1:36:53] in a time of mortal life am subject to
[1:36:57] all kind of spirits and thoughts and
[1:37:02] ideas but what does the word
[1:37:09] say did he choose us before the world
[1:37:12] and say well I'll choose Wade but I
[1:37:14] won't choose
[1:37:16] Samuel said right no
[1:37:19] amen but that's what it looks like
[1:37:21] doesn't it m
[1:37:24] come on you human you mortal that's what
[1:37:27] it looks like don't
[1:37:30] it but it can't be cuz it make him a
[1:37:32] respector person
[1:37:37] right but see then we think it's the
[1:37:39] great idea that he chose Wade because he
[1:37:42] knew Wade would want to have salvation
[1:37:45] that's true got something to do with it
[1:37:49] but if you go that
[1:37:50] route then Wade's got something to do
[1:37:53] with it right MH he chose y God didn't
[1:37:57] choose us in
[1:37:59] him but we're chosen in him we chosen in
[1:38:02] whoever was back there and we better
[1:38:05] look back there and see who was back
[1:38:08] there and if was only one God we better
[1:38:11] keep it in the right
[1:38:13] order and like I said when we stepped
[1:38:16] over in word form in him we were not
[1:38:18] there in theophany bodies he was but we
[1:38:21] were in him the word right all right
[1:38:30] amen a lot of difference when we
[1:38:32] consider
[1:38:34] it makes us go home and think don't
[1:38:39] it I thought I had that figured out
[1:38:41] until you preached
[1:38:43] it all
[1:38:46] right if you thought you had it out
[1:38:48] until I figured out until I preached it
[1:38:50] then you didn't have it figured out
[1:38:51] that's just as blank language as can be
[1:38:53] you and me or anybody else we didn't
[1:38:55] have it figured out if somebody else can
[1:38:57] take it away from
[1:38:58] you if somebody can take away from you
[1:39:02] the new birth you've got you don't have
[1:39:04] the new birth you've only got a
[1:39:07] concept cuz the new birth can never be
[1:39:09] taken from you'd be the same way taking
[1:39:11] it from Jesus amen they may kill the
[1:39:14] body the sin but they can't take away
[1:39:16] come on brother that's right take on
[1:39:19] these
[1:39:21] things we're going to be the messenger
[1:39:23] too still up in heaven but I hope he was
[1:39:26] listening to what I was saying part of
[1:39:31] God eternal
[1:39:33] life a part of
[1:39:37] God not a second
[1:39:40] person Jesus wasn't a second person you
[1:39:44] and I are not a second
[1:39:48] person we are that person amen living on
[1:39:52] Earth in a form called a
