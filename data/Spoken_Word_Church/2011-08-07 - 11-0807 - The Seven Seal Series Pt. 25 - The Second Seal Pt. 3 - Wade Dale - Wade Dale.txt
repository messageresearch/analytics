========================================

that's life but this is more than life my brother Brian said about assurance that the insurance agent told him said well if you don't have insurance that won't get you in the in the graveyard for brother Roundtable but if I have usherence it'll get me out not worried about getting in I'm worried about getting out all right after this life is over we don't have to worry about it if we make our preparation right here maybe this is the wake up call for all of us to be a little more sober and a little more humble a little more aware that life is fragile that's right very frightening and you never know what's in the mind of a person that's right that's exactly right we have to do with it and go on that's you know what we're talking about now about the uh the Dark Ages those people died by the Millions and they just kept right on going brother Brown said it was at Ox spirit that us that labor that sacrificial they just give their life for the gospel that was just part of the age and part of the thing and you know what it's given to us in this age to do the same thing be a sacrifice be sacrificial not so much literally now but with our time and you know support that we support each other uh we're still human we have feelings we need to let them out talk to somebody life friends with people I mean even though you're a born-again Believer look at all these people that was in this fourth age they were born again Christian yet they died by the millions daily they were dying in hundreds but what did they do I don't think they sat around and said oh we better quit doing this we better not be let's go let's go you know no you don't want it done it's separated than Believers from the make believe and I promise you that because when you get ready to go in that lines then you know you're not coming out you better know that like I said about that Assurance the Assurance is going to get them out of the out of the Grave all right it doesn't matter about the insurance going in it's about the Assurance going out but let's read uh starting with the second seal now we we finished with the first seal get started with the second and I hope you all enjoyed another mom last week those of you that we're here yeah that would be the lesson on the internet we are going to get to hear him again next Sunday we're going to give him another chance to pass out he didn't finish his fault and I'm going to be in Oklahoma so I just pray for me I'm leaving Friday morning and I'll be back Monday but just remember Bob he uh trial by fire right bro tonight around my fire that somebody told me that he didn't get finished with all his notes and he said what am I going to do I only got a week I said just read the notes that you didn't read last Sunday that's a preacher's secrets you don't use a lot of notes you Circle them and you use them in the next service all right he said it was good because he made him study I said now he knows what we have to go do we have to study you know that's why that's why we're and we're serving this yeah you take brother they don't have them to get three services a week retired or not retired I used to do it when he wasn't retired he used to get three services every week now you don't just sit down in your study and lean back in your chair and God forged it in the Bible says study to show yourself approved not I'll pour it in he said I'll pour out the windows of Heaven he'd be inside I was gonna pour it in your brain so so you pray for these people that labor the laborers the five-fold ministry you pray for them and you know me being a part of you we all need prayer right you need to practice and I need to pray all right chapter six of Revelation more as the day approaches the Bible says we need to bind together right let's don't separate people bind together that's right the more we bind together the more what does what does Satan want to do he wants to divide and conquer that's what he did right here he divided the people and he conquered them by what by giving them a false Doctrine took peace and killed by story we'll talk about the doctrine all right let's go to verse three and when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see and there went out another horse that was red lost another horse but it's the same person riding on that horse all right same devil riding on the horse but the horse now is red instead of white white he got him remember we talked about white he deceived them with white but now this red you can't deceive with red so he's raised up a little bit higher in that red horse is going to be brother Brandon said blood that's what we'll we'll point to this in just a second let's finish there without another horse that was red and power was given there's that other power was given brother Arthur Satan has no powers in chapter six if you'll underline every time the word given is used you'll see that God gave him permitted power Satan has zero power unless you give it to him okay unless you get like we said if he had a bowl with no arrows we bundle up a big box of arrows every day and we hand it to Satan and say here shoot me that's right we give him the errands right the straightest the best the sharpest why don't we give God our bath take the short of the word that's all of it that's it me include I'm I'm part of this whole thing all right power was given to him that sat there on to take peace from the Earth and that they should kill one another not just him doing the killing now he has moved up listen pay attention to this kill one another so it's not just Satan doing the killing he has now instilled his Doctrine into somebody else and now somebody else is doing the killing yeah Satan's a coward he heard me say that Zayn's account you know why because you get somebody else to do his Dirty Work you get somebody else to do his dirty work okay you understand that so he's a coward he has no power so he gets the power from you that's right divide and conquer he brings you in right he says hey why don't you do this and then what did they do kill one another brother Brown says kill the influence of a man you've killed the man so who how do you kill an influence of a man oh did you know you see that brother that boy he killed his influence because I start with this brother this brother starts with this brother this brother tell this brother this brother we can't keep our mouths yet James said the tongue's the hardest thing to tame so smallest muscle and the hardest one to tame so but you know what if we cut it off they're like them resistance it'll sure help to resist the devil he'll flee from you power was given to him that sat in their own to take peace from the earth and that they should kill one another let me emphasize again now it's not just Satan riding in a white righteous church he has now took that white righteous Church to another level and he's using that white righteous Church to do what go out and do his dirty work now remember one thing that is in opposition to that real white righteous church that went out that was led by God led by the Holy Spirit God does the same thing actually Satan is copying of God right because God's doing the same thing God's wanting to work through you he God's not God don't want all the glory he's going to get all the glory because he's God but he wants you to work through you okay he wants to work through human being so see Satan wants to do the same thing so you got copycats say this copycat but God wants to reveal God wants to give you peace everything that's that's on here is vice versa is what God wants to do Satan wants to take away peace God wants to give peace all right right here remember I said Peace I give unto thee what the piece of knowing that you got God in your heart right all right to take peace from the earth and they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword what was it a great sword not just a sword a great sword it's a Doctrine right remember it started with a saying among the people Deeds of the Nicolaitans and 606 now it's become a Doctrine so what does the doctrine do Doctrine I tell this one the doctrine that one goes and tells that doctor to somebody else see what happened Satan got in that in the church the real Church Satan got in a real Church the brother Adam said the real bride went to nicaea to try to stop this and brother Ryan said they got trapped in itself what happened they were we Christians not fully mature Christians not not the palms and the peters and and the ones that if they would have went to nice if they'd had to put them in jail they had to throw the place up but a lot of weak Christians went there and they got caught in the Trap all right divide and conquer Keel all right because remember the first deal we looked at was justification that was the Seal of God in a white righteous Church Satan's then it was God in a white righteous Church the real righteous church and if you're righteous the Bible says you're just as righteous as God is so you're just you're Justified Justified means you didn't do it in the first place all right so now we're at the second seal which is red blood which is sanctification I want you to remember that keep that we'll go back to all these we're going to come back to them later but right now we're getting the symbols we're getting what happened we're putting the ages together with them and then when we come back we're going to see justification sanctifications of baptism the Holy Ghost and then the pure word of God which is that your first sale second sale third sale for sale all right second seal which is red red signifies what blood and blood the blood of Jesus Christ does what cleanses and sanctifies that's the only thing that's sanctifies remember brother Ryan said the world you can think these seals and time right into the world because the world was justified under Noah there was a judge group of people under Noah's age no one and his family were saying all right that's God washing the Earth off justifying it then he Sanctified it by what Jesus Christ coming and brother Ryan said he shed his blood his blood drops on the earth to cleanse and claim everybody that's why I want you to understand that this this glorified body thing that brother Dale's preaching about it is is a lot deeper than what we're catching I believe because when he's when that blood dripped on the Earth your body your natural moral the one I'm looking at now your body was in the earth he cleansed do you hear what I said he cleansed and claimed it that's right at Calvary right your body now your soul was redeemed before the foundation of the world because your name was put in the lounge Book of Life and I'll let you understand that but when you come down in human flesh your body was already her name I'm sorry Mama eating out of the syrup that's correct mother ate beans and potatoes and the beans and potatoes went and got down in the soil of the earth and pulled all those nutrients up nutrients were in the beans mama ate the beans daddy eat the beans blood cells were produced and what is um we're all adults everybody's sperm and and it's highly congealed blood it's it's DNA uh same thing with the female with the egg what is it it's 16 elements so your body was physically not just this is not something that just well listen to a good thought I think a lot of us would just say well this is just a good thought well praise the Lord my body was in the earth no your literal body you're standing in right now within the Earth that's right that's right as elements and when Jesus died and that blood dripped on the earth it cleansed and claimed the body you're in right now if you're born again that's right if you're not born again then you just got a downward pull and you're just here root Beast made for Destruction sorry that's just the way it goes that's right um and I want to make mention if somebody hears this but I've had some people make comments about what we're saying down here I want you to understand one thing there's a difference in being justified Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost and die and Libya or live your life out as a good Christian and pass on and then come up in the resurrection that's one I think the comment was made that I was pretty strong on on smoking and drinking and stuff like that and you know somebody come to me and said well you know what about the man that drank the beer he was a Christian but he drank beer but what happened to him God shortened his life I want y'all to understand one thing that's not what we're talking about down here you smoke and drink and defile your body right now you're not going to take a change we're talking about a change this is talking about changing the body right and I don't I don't know how to separate this I've been wanting to preach on this but it'll hurt feelings there's Christians that's going to be good Christians and have eternal life and they're going to die and go by the Grave gonna have to people now it's not a it's not a something we bypass but when we're talking about these seals we're talking about the purest form and you say Well it you're talking about works faith without worse and then Works without faith by my words I'll show you my faith that's right what faith for now what a body change see brother Arthur um job had a he had a saying he said in my flesh I shall see God that's what he said right in my flesh right here in my flesh but now in the end time without dying in my flesh I shall see God without dying somebody's gonna make that change and smoke is not going to be a part of it drinking's not gonna be I did not say that I don't be christianized somebody what I'm saying is down here when we're talking about this we're talking about the fullness we're talking about going to the change of my body you might be a Christian I don't see how but you might be a Christian and smoke and still I don't see how you can do that because God won't go on an unclean vessel but now you can get trapped just like the just like the preacher did you can get trapped all of us can get trapped we're humans that's right adulteries and stuff like that that's not going to knock you out of heaven but now you keep on doing that right you never had it to start with right but brother Brown said Satan has one shot wherever you're the weakest you better cover it because he's got he's due one shot because see he's a squatter for this thing right here I know Jesus Christ cleansed and claimed it but remember Gone In the Garden of Eden he cursed the Earth and he cursed Adam didn't curse he cursed the Earth so the Earth has a curse on it and Satan now has a hold on that because that's all he uses the curse that's right Satan is cursed so he's got to hold on this human body a little tie to it that's right but I was reading last night in in Rising of the sun need to read that over and over again with the new birth though you have an abstract title deed that clears everything back everything see but now we're not talking about greasy grains we're not talking about where you can go out and do whatever you want to do no you can't do that but you can slip and fall you can do things wrong you can you know if you had a problem with with alcohol and and you know you like that preacher did but I promise you one thing you're not going to make a body change that's what I want you to understand when I say that you're dying and going to hell I don't mean you're dying and going to hell just because you smoke but if you're a Christian you won't do it but if you do get caught and do do it you'll either quit real quick or God's going to cut your life shorts you wonder why these people's lives are being cut short God's not gonna put up with junk right right that's all of us any of us God's number put up with John that's true that's right that's the word here that's right keep a balance I want y'all to listen to me and I'll leave it listen on the internet listen to me you have got to separate these two things that we're talking about and everybody understand that this means yes and this means no right yeah I see some loud amens and I see some really good but you can be a Christian and have problems that's right but when we're talking about this right here what we're talking about in this Sunday school class about the seals that is the the the Apex of anything that's ever been on the earth because you know what Jesus Christ even had to give he gave his life right for you and I right but he was without sin he took on your sin amen so that you can be sinless okay so let's go back to the seal now that we got off of that sorry but I want to clarify that because I don't want people to have a question say well you say you're condemning uh you know and I'm sure the person's gonna hear this but uh they said well I'm glad you're not going to be my judge well let me tell you one thing God put me in this place right here my words are going to condemn you whether you like it or not exactly if it's from God now if it's not if it's just way down and getting in the flesh then then it's just me getting in the flesh forgive me but if it's God speaking to you and it's the truth and it comes out of this word yeah what I say will judge you right you know you say well I'm glad you're not my judge you come to church and listen I'm not your judge but the word that comes out is the judge and if I tell you the truth that's right then I'm just a mouthpiece just like this this thing I got right here amen you know I'm just this right here God's speaking to you through that that's right and I hope that that's what you know you sometimes we do get in the flesh sometimes we do have our own comments and our own ideas but when we're talking about this these seals we're talking about a specific group of people not just all Christians and I don't need christianized people that didn't you know brother Ryan didn't say about that old preacher everybody don't remember the story and do I need to tell the story remember that there was a minister brother Brown said a child of God right childhood of God said a child of God y'all gotta remember one thing look what Adam did right amen he was a Son of God he come straight from God didn't have to be born he wasn't born with sin and look what he done look at all those people through the Old Testament we know they didn't have the new birth but look at all the people in Utah a lot of things happened a lot of things went on you got to be careful but this minister brother Brown said he came to a point that he said I'm done I'm finished I'm not preaching anymore he said the devil got a hold of his mind and that's where he plays right here in your mind got a hold of his mind and he told them everybody told the black guy said hey Moe's gonna buy me a a six-pack I'm just I'm done with it he throwed it toward his part up throw it in the trash mode had enough sense he said I'm not going to get you none so he went got it himself and started drinking and brother random said shortly thereafter he died like a month he died he said God took that servant see so he was identifying God took that servant home that's right so he was a Christian he went to heaven God if God took somebody home it's not the hell right if God took his servant home it's to Heaven said God took his servant home so he wasn't Mario's name now I'm not talking about Martin the man's name he wasn't marked my name because you can't do that you can't you can't see me down at the brothel ever Saturday night and didn't see me you know here on Sunday and something had something got happened okay so we got to be careful about what we do careful about our life and I apologize for some of the things that I say that may be too strong but it's the truth if you smoke drink and cursing do the things you used to do and you're still doing them now you're not born again period amen if you're sitting right here if you've been listening this long in this church and you're still doing it you're not born again best thing to do go to the altar all right you're committing adultery you're doing the thing you need to go the office you're not even part of this that's right and I'm not trying to separate what we're talking about last night remember brother Ryan was talking about going through segregation this is the segregationalist part not black and white right right but sin and righteousness that's right cannot come together they have to be separated that's right so I don't want you to I want you to understand one thing I'm not de-christianizing people I'm just telling you what the word says we can fall we can stumble but brother Brian said the true Mark of a Christian is to get back up that's right and go quit what you're doing get up and take off and say God don't ever let me do that again all right and and you know what you think well that's too simple let's don't get into Catholicism where we think we got to beat ourselves by with a whip or go on a 40-day faster or drag or you know do like Luther thought he could you know he could lay out on a rock you know and and let somebody beat him and you can't beat it out of you I promise you that right God's got to take it out of it and you ask God you know I was thinking this morning brother Brandon said if you got a problem with x do the vice versa that's profound but yet simple if you're stingy give money away right that's what he said did he not say that dude the vice versa all right just do the vice versa and he didn't give scripture for that you gave five scriptures for doing the vice versa but there's one scripture says flee the devil or resist the devil and he'll flee from them powerful scripture yes but but remember when we're talking about these seals when I'm talking about the the change in the body you're not going to have those kind of problems now we're going to have human life problems don't think we're gonna be superhuman that's right well we are Supernatural That's right like we talked about last night we are Supernatural group of people even even a sinner is Supernatural right A Sinner's Supernatural The Sinner dies where does his body go and you don't have to open the door for it to get out that's right so it's supernatural it's not natural natural is the body can go out the door did you separate the body and the soul my soul just goes down it's in another dimension so it's supernatural like they said it's supernatural don't get that mixed up with eternal there's terrestrial and celestial bodies terrestrial down here Celestial is is where you got what you got here it's kind of interesting how your body works and then all of a sudden when you take whatever's inside of you out it quits working I mean what's making all this you ever thought about you ever sat down and thought about it if you ever sit down and thought that that how your body is one whole unit but if you start separating those units yeah something happened yeah that's right so the body is really just like this microphone it only does what the inside tells it to do listen unless you have a a muscle problem my hand won't just automatically do this I gotta make it to it you know automatically it just hangs like this but I'll make it do what I want it to do you know I was thinking um the medical professional s so that's where the greatest battle is sure in your mind the greatest battle is not in your flesh I promise you that your flesh only does what you're inside tell them to do right so don't say my flesh made me do it right no the devil inside you made you do it and your flesh just responding and just responds it's just like a it's just like a covering you just pull over a covering that's all this is it's just like a rubber covering but it's made out of Flash so I don't know how the world we got into this but maybe we needed it today but in the second seagull let's remember one thing before we before we get done um let's look at our symbol gotta tell him you want to put it on a swing of samples get the symbols and then Brothers uh Bob will be with you next weekend and then Mom are y'all going to Mama are y'all going to Johnson Richard nope no but the next basically the one Wednesday or Sunday anyway if I have to preach Sunday then somebody else can do that brother you all need to get one ready whoever turn it is okay all right second seal power was given to him who the devil all right it was a what a great story which was brother Brown said it was a Doctrine so all right the symbols was to take peace and to kill that's naturally and spiritually because remember during this time of this fourth Church age in the dark at ages 68 million Christians were put to death all right the red horse is a symbol of blood the combat Beast is the Ops which we were just talking about the sacrificial part uh that were a burden barrier that labored this was the longest Church age it went from like 606 A.D to 1500 it was one of the long it was the longest turkey but God was with these people just as much as he's with us now all right they just didn't have the depth of the word there their their their whole point was I believe in Jesus Christ he died for my sins and now I give my life for the gospel see that was the life that they left okay but we have to be a little bit I don't like to say different but maybe a little bit um and I don't like to say better or higher up but but more word has come to us than than they had the word they have well the word Luther had was the just shall live by faith he didn't care about sanctification he could drink a beer and smoke a pot and it didn't bother him but see that was God for the time he believed come out of that Catholic church and said that just shall live by faith not by what the Catholic Church says or Not by pennants or by novenas or but live by faith what faith in the word of God he didn't just read that one scripture and die and only priests out of the Bible that he could show there that the Justified people live by faith the Bible was being written in Martin Luther's time so he had the Bible he had this Bible that we're looking at now he had the word of God so he had a little more understanding because these people in this Dark Age didn't have a Bible they'd have a Bible sure they might have had some appalls or writings or something or Peter but they didn't have a compound Bible until right there at the end in 1500 A.D they started putting the Bible together maybe somewhere in the latter part but most of these people only had think about it think about this they went to church underground most of the time they didn't have a great big Sanctuary for the air conditioning and a great big sign that told us who told him who he was and all they met in houses and and underneath houses and stuff like that they were hiding because it meant give your you're going to give your life but they didn't have a Bible they didn't have a quote book that's right they had what that preacher told them only sure they might have the Old Testament the Torah and some of those things but what I'm talking about they didn't come to church with any kind of book the income church with a book in their hand with a quote book well Paul said well they might have had but you know what they've done they believed in those pastors and teachers and evangelists they had them back then no this is not just for the end time this this was this started in Peterstown all right so they had those people and and but you know what the difference was they had the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost told them whether that man was talking the truth or not in any road or down s paper sure I'm sure people maybe took notes but think about coming to church now and no no computer none of broke around the book all you had was what the preacher told you we're getting back to it we're going to get back to it you're going to get back to where you're going to be the quote you're going to be the living Bible you're not gonna have to carry around a computer not heaven for sure but when we get closer to the end time we ever get separated again it's going to be almost like this right here right you're going to have what you've got in here right it's got to come here first but it's got to drop down here right right all right so Church age for the fourth Age The Wicked one was physically killed the people and spiritually killed more than was physically killed brother Reynolds said 68 million were physically killed and he's an Untold billion were killed by the doctrine not just of the Catholic church we think Catholic church but brother round does call that the Catholic age okay which was the age that the Catholics put all these people who do you think put these people to death we went to robbers and the thieves and the whoremongers it was the Christian so-called so-called Christian what was he doing he was riding a red horse getting his power from the people saying it's better to kill them than to let them go on the way they are better to kill them and bring your steelbook make sure you bring the steel books don't we come together
