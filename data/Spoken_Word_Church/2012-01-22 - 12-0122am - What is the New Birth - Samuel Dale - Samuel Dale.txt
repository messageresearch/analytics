========================================

turn to 146. it's 146 in his final book me my now i am happy all the days degrees i my is oh i service open the eyes of my heart open the eyes of my heart open open the eyes of my heart and foreign holy holy holy a good time sitting around and every one of us came back with sore bottoms yeah we sit four hours in the morning four hours needing four days and a half don't worry yeah but it was a good time amen just remember now the lord willing wait we'll be preaching the evening service to be much in prayer for him lord to be with us got a lot of requests to be given and uh sister is it jeannette of it brother richard wilson's her husband passed away um yesterday i think it was so remember the family there you know and then remember to keep praying for brother holbert arnold we have him on the prayer list but remember to keep praying for him about his eyesight they're going to start putting some shots into his eye to see and get that if it'll happen so just remember that and also brother richard wilson now will be having some work done on his apostate having it shaved on i guess of what you call it shaving it on friday so remember that keep him in your prayers the lord will bless all right brother hal thomas uh had to have some stents placed in his heart and some other worked on it but he's doing fine so you know just keep praying for him i think that's about all of the the ones that we remember but just let the lord have his way all right john 3 be very familiar scripture with everybody and we will be speaking on this for two or three services i don't know exactly how much that we'll go but um we're going to try to just do more preaching if we can on a lot of it than to do as much as we call it teaching and try to to get a point across because um you know it was laid a burden on weight heart to get a a list of prayers you know people put on the prayer list for salvation and uh you know there's a lot placed on there and then you know the families if you want your family put on there you want your children husband wife etc whatever father mother uh placed on that list then do it and he will have a list and then that way you can just you don't have to have the list you can always use the way i do i just say lord you remember the list well he can't forget the list so we don't have to worry about calling all the names but you know just pray that the lord would do that so i thought would it just be a good time to i had announced maybe that i would be speaking on some like doctrinal issues of the message uh why i don't agree with them on what i do believe etc and but we'll get to that but we'll take two or three services maybe a couple on this about what is the new birth amen you know some of you are concerned whether or not you have the new birth and that's wonderful i can think that's a great thing is to be because those that hunger and thirst after righteousness shall be filled so i believe that so you just listen and if you're doing and i know what satan generally does by the time i announce something ahead that's going to be helpful here then a lot of you go somewhere else to church for services or whatever you do and you generally miss it but please listen to the tape right and we're going to take this opportunity to speak on what is the new birth okay john 3 father we thank you we love you and we ask you to just bless us with your presence now that this day forgive our sins because we want to be covered by the blood and just keep us and bless each and every one all of these that the nines were called the ones that were requested the prayer that you'll be with each one this one that's lost her husband just be a comfort unto her lord be with brother arnold everybody's high lord and restore it back unto it and these all the requests that were given thank you for being with brother how lord he didn't have to have the major surgery that they were wondering about but yet we know you come on the scene and take care of all times we love you and we thank you and we ask you to just come down speak to our hearts as we talk about you in jesus name amen john 3 very familiar scripture with all of us right there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the jews the same came to jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that that thou art a teacher that really is the teacher he was the king teacher he was the great of all right we know that thou art a teacher come from god for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except god be with him what a testimony jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto you except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god nicodemus says unto him count can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born jesus answered verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit marvel not that i said unto thee you must be born again you may be seated the lord have his blessing to the reading of the word now i emphasize and always do because brother brown said that actually nicodemus and i believe it's schamelia and he said would be given eternal life because of their stand right well you know this nicodemus here he said that we know we we not just die and he was called and if you look in the original there you'll see that it says the teacher now in verse 10 where he repeats it thy art a teacher the original says the teacher in other words he was the top man everybody wanted to go to him he would be the top college uh professor today or whatever you would want to call it and uh but everybody wanted to listen to it and he said we we know that no man can do the things that you're doing except god be with him amen so we're just concerned about it i'd like to sit down and talk with you in other words amen all right first thing he said though to him he said nick of about his ranking and told him all the things but he said you must be born again amen well to a man that was highly educated and i'm talking about bible educated i'm talking about uh worldly knowledge of everything uh he knew what the scroll said he knew what the things were said he must have been an honest man in his heart because he wasn't like the other uh you know pharisees sadducees that was wanting to kill jesus because of of who he was and what he was doing he was he gave him a great honor all right in doing that but jesus turned to him he said nicodemus you must be born again all right we good badness you know that's where it came from so the reason i say that we should pour on nicodemus all he had to do is believe well that's a good point but he must have been a pretty good believer to jesus and talk to him all right but still you know i used to try to discuss it with him right with him right before i left the bad just you really about the time i began to hear about the message i could read the scriptures that don't say he that believes he said he didn't believe it and i've questioned that point with him well why does it say believe it right so that means continue on amen you don't have the bad disbelief if you just believe it that's it you're you're going to be there well why is it that a lot are not going to be there right but you know that's derby is that's not ours but what i want to do is just talk jesus i said about salvation and do you that you know that are not really set in the basis of your salvation of maybe believing you're born again then i ask you to please just listen and then write down comments questions etc something that i need to emphasize a little more and you know we'll try to to do that and you know most everybody says well what do you mean brother dale i'm born again i'm in the message well nicodemus was in the message right he was in the message of the day that's right and he saw new light and he stepped up into the light right you know enough to talk about it right so he must have been a pretty good believer but still that when it was said to him his natural man could not comprehend right right of all his uh education and his abilities and god working with him and doing with him and you know like that he said you you mean i've got to go back to my mother's womb he just couldn't comprehend and jesus tried to explain it to him but yet how could he explain entering the thing that he had come to make a way to do and to make manifest when they believed that staying in that letter of the law that that was what saved them the great apostle paul you know we emphasized that a lot he said you know concerning the law blameless but he said i found what i thought was life he said i found it to be dead and to him see it was keeping the law to the letter and that's what nicodemus that's all he could comprehend was keeping the letter of the law doing what god says being good now i've always emphasized to you but i like to do that that you know these are not just common ordinary people you're talking about that just well i go to church every once in a while when i walk to and and i believe in god oh yeah great jehovah these were people that almost born raised and that's right and spent their entire life into the tabernacle that's right living for god but yet how can you understand the new birth come on right so mankind has spent thousands of years now too almost or a little over trying to explain what jesus was talking about and you find in the message of the hour moving on up to where we're at that you find the good old baptist and they say well i believe the message you know i believe everything the prophet said and you find good old methodists you know that say well i was sanctified my my life changed and things are different now you know then you find good pentecostals that you know when i spoke in tongues i've shouted i've done all the things and i know i'm saved well i wonder what would happen if the lord jesus sat down and talked with you and i personally and brought us to a consciousness now get the situation a consciousness of our own lives and our own being and our own doings and bring us to that position like he did nicodemus that was sitting there that understood all of the scriptures right him say you must be born again i wonder what we would quote back to him as i said i shouted i believe i spoke in tongues i believe the message what would be our answers back to the lord jesus in that situation and then we come up to the super duper faith type of people that you run into that they'll actually even say it to you you can't tell me i ain't saved and then they'll give you some reason for that you know i've done this didn't do that i do that whatever they bring a reasoning into it to try to prove that they are born again well i don't believe you have to prove you're born again that's right right i never have tried to to preach or believe that you had to prove your salvation i believe your salvation will prove you you know i i think it'll make manifest in our lives and and and will prove us to be what we are unto to that point but now just think about it what is the new birth all right now we're up in this age where that we supposed to be climbing the prophet's message you know i believe what he says and we're in the age now that there was a time that like the prophet would say that in the days of luther to just believe god you were saved he said then it moved on to deeper depths to where that it would come through the mess of this period of sanctification and he's called that the new birth of the rages and times which he was all right and then he come to the pentecostals and he'd say now that was good but he'd say it like this he said a lot of people believed and had the holy ghost he said a lot of people believed and didn't have it right that's right he said a lot of people shouted and had the holy ghost he said a lot of people shouted and didn't have it he said a lot of people spoke in tongues and gifts and had the holy ghost and a lot of them didn't have it all right now my point has always been to say why why didn't they believe it when even the bible says that jesus was seen of as many as 500 brethren after his resurrection seen after he raised witnessed him as to be the messiah that rushed amen right but yet when it came to the upper room experience there was only 120. that's right what happened to the 380 right see my point is to try to get across something that you know to get us away from what we're looking at is our salvation to see if what we're looking at is our salvation is word oriented or based upon the bible amen all right you say well i've seen visions i've done this i've done that it's all wonderful but gifts and callings are without repentance that's right amen you don't have to be a christian to have gifts in your life that's right just don't save you all right going to church don't save you right right being good don't save you all right that is supposed to be an outward manifestation of what has happened on the inside of us right amen all right and i just finished the series there will be therefore perfect and um this kind of just ties in with it but we found in that that that you're not born again in your body you're not born again in your spirit part of you remember to reason conscious affection etc you're born again in the center part of you which is called the soul all right where brother branham would say that sense that that has only one sense it's either faith or doubt right it's not faith and doubt it's either faith or doubt because you're either born again or not now i don't want to get into the born-again experience as much on this message i want to just talk about justification because the prophet of god says in this day this reading is bringing it down see it's not and i'll emphasize that in a minute we believe in three stages of grace not three works we'll read that in a minute now it is not works so it's not three works of grace now you'll get right around even call it three words of christ but then you'll hear him explain it that it's not three works because none of it's works so it's three stages are manifestations amen of the same holy ghost he said the same holy ghost that justified the lutheran sanctified the methodists baptized the pentecostal that's 464 pretty sure in the steel book it's now settings either letter 251 he said it's now sitting in order the coming of the lord it's the same holy ghost justification is a work of the holy spirit sanctification is a work of the holy spirit that's right but the baptism is the holy spirit amen so now we want to stay with that point see we'll read these in a minute all right but get my whole whole point of trying to get us to see how many of you remember when you first repented of your sins right amen now you can remember that you were going wrong and something happened and the bible says that the goodness of god is what leads us to repentance amen all right now we'll get back to this scripture in a minute but remember jesus said you can't come to me unless my father draws you all right now but make sure you understand if you're concerned about your salvation you know you're concerned about it you're not certain about it you don't know but you're wanting god to to reveal something to you remember then that god must be calling you right all right man all right see something working on you right right you remember when you know i've heard a lot of your testimonies you know that you know you just you have really no idea a lot of times that brother dean's there he's he he went to church with his sister or somebody had no thoughts about going for salvation he's probably going to show off his suit or his car and uh you know no point of of trying to be saved but then just something happens all right but i want to emphasize to you see you say but how do i know if god is calling me if there's something dealing with you it certainly is not the deal that's right all right so god is calling you now many are called but a few are chosen all right but see many are called in other words take that that's pulling up on you so i told you i wanted to preach instead of maybe teach so much on it is take that that's pulling up on your heart and count that to be god called again that's right count that to be the calling you know that god is calling you he's speaking to you all right and then you can move from that because the emphasis i want to make through the whole thing is one thing the prophet of god said everything we get from god must come by faith right right amen all right now let's don't make faith a great super duper whether that on up into the new birth a little okay just stay with me where i'm at we say well now of faith what sometimes faith is just simply believing right that's right because the bible said i believe it's in hebrews that works if he that cometh to god must believe that he is all right now that's what i've been you know kind of doing while i was sitting on the deer stands and taking my ipod and just two in the morning two in the evening just listening to tapes and just having a good time doing that because you're sitting in a box and doesn't matter how much racket hardly you make you know so uh but then i just stopped sometimes and just think you know that little statement that he that cometh to god must believe that he is right all right now let me show you and i'm trying to get you to a mental thought you know that history you know what i mean by history is records and things like that you know what i'm saying by history you know that history can prove that jesus christ existed they could prove that he lived they can prove that he was crucified that's right fine i mean you know history can prove it all right now does that save history you know because he that cometh to god must believe that he is not that he was right science can prove or our history can prove that he did exist prove that he died and even the records would go by to whether they probably wouldn't believe it a lot but they still got to admit something happened to him that he raised and then they got some more proof records that you know if that something happened to their disciples because they all claimed they believed him and claimed they seen him after his resurrections and different things you know and then the proof of it was to coming on the day of pentecost with the baptism with the holy ghost but get what i'm saying now see to believe that he was is is one thing that's good amen it's a background amen all right we can depend upon that but it's that won't save you amen that's right you got to believe that he is amen to be saved right now he is his present tense not past tense not two seconds ago he is his very present tense for eternity now in that then keep the thought it doesn't say he was it's always he is right man nicodemus didn't go up and talk to some of the disciples after the death of the lord jesus and and you know discuss things with them he was talking with the one that was there present right see now to be saved then you're going to have to believe it that way yes and all we get comes by faith said don't get that faith right now up into a super duper revelation right see get it to the point of just simply what it starts out a bit my feminist names the prophet said when your mental faith becomes a spiritual revelation all right see faith then starts off by believing right we got to believe and the main thing to believe is one thing now we say well i believe he died and i believe he died for mankind but i just don't know whether he died for me or not right well what are you concerned about yeah there you go what are you thinking about well i'm thinking about it because something's dealing with it that's right all right amen keep the message in mind what i'm trying to bring across right so then you say well something has been dealing with me well would not not be god calling you all right so believe he's calling you and i believe he's calling other people won't save you you got to believe he's calling you well if you're concerned then something's happening right a work of the holy spirit is within your life to worry that you're being concerned about your life that's why that brother branham was against um he wasn't against alder causing giving them he was against mankind's form of alder calls that they had developed and i was a personal experience of that being uh 18 years old before it's even converted into baptism and my sister i've told you she came to me in church you know trying to get me to come to the altar and otherwise told me embarrass me and everybody in the world trying to get me to come to alder and what she said to me i've told you blunt about it she said her husband got killed in a car wreck and she said jc didn't have an opportunity to repent but you do oh my well i thought more of my brother-in-law's experience with a with god maybe not a salvation but a man then i thought of her super-duper spiritual doings and she told me and i believe her that she had actually been praying and reach out and feel god hold his legs and things and i believe her i wouldn't argue with her about it but see i knew what the man was that she was talking about well she was trying to get me to do something the brother brother says don't do that that's right he said don't go to him and say you know mama was saved daddy was saying you want to go to heaven you got to go the way you need to come to the altar he said you make him a twofold child he said because if they don't get saved that day he says a whole lot harder to get him to come back to the office right so that's why i don't believe in doing things like that you know i have seen it in times when i stood here and spoke the word that people would be saying well i don't have no problem with that i mean that that one that proves out i don't have no problem with that but you don't hear me telling it about everybody right it's just when the lord tells me that that will take place but now get it what is justification then we must believe in justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost today makes the new birth right right amen now you do not have in this day now we're here this day we're not back there i explained luther wesley pentecost that was the message of the hour that was the day of god dealing and that was the new birth and that was eternal life right amen but here today is required that we come through water blood spirit justification sanctification the baptism in the holy ghost now you do not have eternal life when you repent of your sins right that's right i know the message so just hold on you don't have eternal life when you're sanctified that's right right and proven it the disciples did not have it right they believed they lived with the lord jesus and saw all of it they were sanctified in saint john 17. but they did not have eternal life all right now you say but i've got a quote okay hold on to that quote it all fits together if you can if you repent of your sins that only chops off your pie sins that's justification that's right run around and explain it like you go out in the yard and you see a glass or something you know you reach down and you pick it up you've got a purpose for it but it's still nasty dirty right you see that's where you justified it cause you picked it no justification being a work of the holy spirit to call us the goodness of god doing it right then at that stage so you repent of your sins and you get baptized no you know when you do the things because you're you're claiming well i'm not a worldly person anymore i'm a christian and i need to live like a christian and uh you know that's what i've done the reason i say i can preach on it and it's odd that an old baptist has to preach justification case the people of this message because they're supposed to be pentecostals right and you can't get one of them hardly to preach on it now you you go listen to tell if you can whether they ever preach anything about justification saying that it's all this great stuff you know somewhere that's up in the mind-boggling situations and no simplicity of salvation you know all right that certainly isn't it's not mine but now justification see it chops off your past sins brother brown said it and i'll give it to you if i don't get it i'll run it off and give them to you this evening or after a while brother brown said that has nothing to do with the future he said you just chopped off your sins right all right you repented you got condemned of what you were doing right and you said i'm sorry you ask god to forgive you if he just wipes that slight clean and there was that we were talking about being perfect and when god wipes anything off the stone right you'll never have to to uh repent again for something you've repented of if it's genuine now we do it because we're human right it's all right but give what i'm saying it's already wiped off there is no sin there if god forgives you so you get under conviction you go to the altar and you say well lord forgive me or some words out sitting out in the woods or or doing something you know people tell about god speaking to them in many different ways you don't have to be in church but the point of it is sometimes you've been in church to learn about god or somebody told you about god you know mom or daddy whatever somebody talk to you about god because we don't believe in just being that see god don't just drop down over in a hot tub of africa and give him the new birth because he hasn't heard the word that's right all right so then truly we understand that jesus had to preach three and a half years before mankind could receive the new birth right all right brother said it was hard for him birth pains to get those pharisees to realize that they were sinners and lost to where he could die for their sins okay that's right without true repentance it's just to simply say i'm sorry lord i'm sorry for the way i've been forgive me all right now there is a quote that i always love to put it right in here because it doesn't cross anything it's perfectly right brother brown said if you die right there sure you're saved now do you need that quote i can be sure to give it for you he said if you died right there when you repented he said surely you're saying that's right that's what people don't understand what brother brown would say saved right and then he'll say born again and then he'll say holy ghost baptism and he was doing just simply what i'm trying to do he was starting off in and you know down here where we're at just talking about the new birth all right and uh see then if you die in that stage where you're truly repented but that don't make you bride now hold on to that because you do not have eternal life you are confessing unto salvation that's right it's not eternal life to repent of your sins it only cleanses out the this gets rid of what the person done you know right in the the soul of being and it does nothing to your future as a matter of fact justification doesn't even work a whole lot in your soul because that one clean spirit is still in there he's just taking right from here back into racing putting it in this seal forgetfulness all right and then see we must move on from that stage and believing it and you start going to church you start acting different and all that's good right because y'all do right now god has done a wonderful thing he has forgiven your sins see that's where a lot of people stop and they say well you know i'm going to church and i like that i'll do it what else you want me to do i just want you to keep on going all right and how many of you heard me make this statement over to 40 something years of your pastor i had rather go down to the end of all this thing and god speak to me at that day and say you had the baptism of the holy ghost 40 years ago i said well okay i've been seeking you and i'm glad i keep trying to do that than to go 40 years thinking i was saved because of something i've done or didn't do or or whatever or believing the message or are doing it i hope what i've said to you is prove that point nicodemus believed the message nicodemus believed this was god he gave witness to it but none of that saved him but i i he'd rather go through life seeking after god and find out i've already had it had to go through life and refusing to seek it and come up one day and find out i don't have the prophet of god explaining that one day about a person he said when that person's dying he said it came to a place said her real soul came up and she had been to church taught sunday school done all kinds of things basically all her life but said her real soul come up before and said she realized she was lost see now she had suppressed that point and that old preacher was standing there and you know what he said give her another hypo well she would turn around to the preacher said you told me a lie you told me like i said and i lost give her another hypo now you know the doc the preacher didn't say that that was his point the doctors was doing it i'm just making my point but do you truly know that's right that you're born again and upon what basis do you place it i saw god when i was 11 years old that didn't save me and take you today put an x where was standing not as a human being person but as a form that i saw amen from that day on i wanted to find that god right but that didn't save me i searched for him but i couldn't find him joined the church when i was 18 years old went to church dating my wife because there was no way i could go to church and get to go with her on sunday afternoon was to go to church you know admit i didn't hear much the preacher said but that's right just honest you'll be that way to help you too but you know but one day see it come to reality you know you've heard me say this that the deacons came to me one or two of them one day won't talk to me about salvation i said listen i live a better life than your deacon lord does and then you better ask me what i meant because i knew what they was doing see because that was what got in my way it was church people right for heaven help don't let anybody right anyway that's right i had to come to realize one day that one thing about it brother modi used to tell me about it my life it was down here in lula and the policeman came up and this little boy was there he was sitting behind the post you know two before and the policeman shined his light out there and said what are you doing son he said i'm hiding there was more of him sticking out than he was behind the boat and that always dwelt with me is to to not want to be anything like that right i've always wanted to be right and sincere right you know i don't have to put on anything we go hunting we do we we just go on in we do our thing right and if anybody wants to talk about the lord we talk about it if they don't we just talk among ourselves and go on you know and don't worry about it because i don't want to be something that i'm not i don't want to be labeled as a hypocrite you know i want to be what i am all the time but i'm just talking to you the about salvation well see i come to realize one day that i couldn't hide behind something it didn't matter whether it was a whole lot bigger than i was or a whole lot smaller that i had to face myself at 18 years old then i faced myself and i said lord i'm sorry forgive me well of course nevada's all you had to do is get up and confess i kind of like what they told the story about the little boys three or four of them up there you know each one of them was up and they said what's the lord done for you and he said let me save my soul and got down to the end when there's a little boy what's the lord done for you he said ain't done nothing yet well at least he's honest i mean he was riding it he stole it like it was right well you know they thought a lot of me and the time i had been there from 58 to 63 i was an ordained deacon so you know they must have thought a lot of me and everything i was teaching adult sunday school classes the company elders and the things when i left but i'm not telling that i'm just telling you they saw something because i always wanted to know about god i like what brother brown says and if when you know i don't mean just one place i love it but he said if you ever have one little touch of god he said you will never be the son right you can't get away from it that's right i tried you know and i just i i don't like i do now i'm still seeking god right right and i every day i say lord save me just fill me with your love you know to the point that i can just be what you want me to be right he said well i thought you said you're saying a long time ago i don't know but i believe in salvation that continually goes on i believe in what peter says being born again right by the incorruptible word i believe that's what this prophet's message come to do was to bring us from a to a place to where we could see salvation as it really was and to be able to accept what god would give us and continually seek god amen you know and just walk on but see we get all tied up in our theologies forgive me we get tied up in what we've been taught yeah and every church teaches something you know right wherever you come from you say well i didn't i don't know much about you you heard something because they taught it to you and uh you know we think about them saying those little songs when this kid you know father son and holy ghost blessed trinity you know let's see we were taught that right and all that dwells within our mentality well remember justification works through your mentality that's where it's working now true mentality of an individual right and then you you come to that place see that you can finally say well i believe you read the i love to read matthew martin luther john you remember one time our disciple said something to the lord jesus and you know it's probably about three years after he'd been talking to him i guess it was a shock he probably do you now believe you know see it took on all that time to come to that place that they really believed in the way he knew because he could look inside and see they were really believing all right let's see now let's get one thing straight and then we'll just do a little bit on and i want to just talk to you but get see we don't believe in works we believe in works following our salvation amen works is what i do for him salvation is what he done for me so we believe in doing work we're living the living right and and doing right and acting right and being condemned to the things y'all remember that that and like i said when i come into the message a lot of you can't say the points i can because you know i mean hey i didn't care nothing about drinking i didn't care nothing about smoking you know the lord didn't have to deliver me from them things and thank god he does deliver people you know but i mean i i said well you know what would chris what would jesus do in this situation and always try to to think about it like that now i know i made a lot of failures don't think you're looking at a goody two-shoes never have that old saying no you're looking at a human being that's honest right and just telling you like it is all right and uh you know i thank god for all those people who tried to help me down through there right doesn't matter what's the matter this baptist or whatever it is thank god for the people who try to help you thank you and try to do something for you right all right you know maybe god will give them you ever thought about it sure maybe god might give them eternal life one day for what they were doing to try to help you and there maybe you as the loss just could be but yet god knows all about it man it was a great thing might be surprising we get there you know and things can happen but now go on we believe in works following our salvation but we don't believe in works as our salvation right no you get saved and then works follow me you know you got to get the baby here amen right that's right right you get the baby here then the baby starts crying speaking in tongues and doing all kinds of things but get that to the point see because we we we believe in three stages of grace go ahead brothers and pull that first one up let's read a little bit but we don't believe in works and see we call it three works of grace now i want you to understand you may read what brother random will say and there is one of these quotes in here that he actually is saying uh manifestation of stages in any minute he says works three words but the one thing i want you to think about and i told her this today is i begin to pull a few quotes together because i didn't have anything until this morning written down i just do a lot of thinking but you see we think of works three works of grace all right you know what i loved about brother brown that made me think of it and then how many how many of you heard me say this uh how is it that brother dale checks the doctrine to see what it's right or not buy my own new birth now why are you gonna check it back quotes ah they quote as much as you can quote and they'll quote them very quote to you as you quote because then in trinitarians we used to talk to them you know i did the bad just a baptist doctrine there's one god of course we didn't understand it we called it god and three persons but you talk about three gods we tell you in a hurry that was hedonism but you know what they read the same scriptures we read right now they read the proof three we read the proof one well so is it in the message of the hour you know that's right but the the quotes are right it's just our understanding about those things so remember we don't believe in three works of grace because works would mean something you had to do with it i believe what it joined to it now that salvation is of the lord amen and if justification is a work of the holy spirit then it's certainly not a human being ezekiel is waivers on the other day what he takes out the old stony heart he gives you a new spirit brother and said that's not the holy spirit he said then i put my spirit as equals he said that's the baptism now see but you know we can get new desires new thoughts and new ways of doing we'll cover some of the sanctification and the things to get onto it but look what the prophet is saying you see each one of those ages only take a dip into the holy spirit justification is the work of the holy spirit sanctification is the work of the holy spirit but the baptism is the holy spirit i never forget that quote justification is a work of the holy spirit now you see why brother branham will interlake works and why james and paul and their talkings and things because god doesn't work on you right amen it's not works that saves us but god doesn't work on you right you repent of your sins you know what he worked on you right that's right he cleaned you up right all right but never forget the statement around the same justification is the work of the holy spirit sanctification is the work of the holy spirit he said but the baptism that's right he is the holy spirit right all right emphasizing what it is see uh then the baptism of the holy ghost is not a work it's a life that's right i don't you know what i'm trying to back it up i want to stay on justification all right but look at the next one it's not three words it's three manifestations and then there was justification i can't take it back to when the holy ghost not three different dispensations now listen to it he's explaining it so carefully listen not three words of grace but one word in three different manifestations same holy ghost was with luther under justification was with was under wesley with sanctification in the church now in the baptism of the holy ghost the same holy spirit not to the holy spirit it's the same holy spirit as i said a minute ago how do you check a doctrine just keep checking it by this man three manifestations of grace three stages within those three manifestations of god amen right father that's three manifestations of the same god the same god called you to repentance is the same god that sanctifies you saying god i wanted to get these on here where you would you know into other people especially now christian friend a person cannot be born again until they have received the holy spirit so you can't you're not even converted until you receive the holy ghost i'm not say listen i'm not saying you're lost before you receive the holy ghost because you're not and that goes with that statement that you made while ago you're not saying i want to go to it he said when you repent of your sins he said you're saved yes sir he said if you die right there sure you're going to heaven but he didn't call you the bride and he don't talk about you with eternal life so you'd have to come up with a foolish virgin right so now once he's doing the same thing you're not even converted until you receive the holy ghost i'm not saying your loss because you re before you receive the holy ghost because you're not there is three there is one work of grace only one work of grace that's the holy spirit and it's made in three manifestations just like there's one god made in three manifestations called a son and holy spirit one god only one now there is the three words now there is the three words of grace you quote that out of there cut it you make him say what you want him to say he's just got to explain it it's not words and there's not three words and then when he makes a statement of three works of grace but there's three manifestations right so he just didn't go in with the book before you know i heard it before or whatever put it in there all right there's a manifestation of justification by faith a man believes god say yes sir i believe that i believe it's the true god he said all right now so it's not three works it's three manifestations of the same holy spirit amen the god that brought you to repentance is the god that filled your soul by the baptism right so it's not three works right it's three stages or three manifestations because it's not three gods amen that's right there's three manifestations of god right now he's tying it all together that's how i check my any doctrine that comes along just this thing this second thing i don't feel what god done in my soul right right oh you always was this and you always was that and you don't need salvation you know what the people in this receipt you don't need it because you always was eternal then the same prophet said you got to come to the altar to receive eternal life right the same one will tell you about three different ways that he's born again if you listen to the master one's in the woodshed and one of them is running down the railroad track i don't know what happened i just know i believe he got born again but you just listen the message a lot and you'll hear a lot of statements that seem to be contrary one to the other you know he'll tell you he was over here when he was really over here he just took him away all right but now watch so where's our salvation in three stages go ahead you gotta do number four okay so now notice what he's saying i just highlighted this tab but uh here's to those who do not have the holy spirit born again as the scripture speaks of being born again if the natural work requires and that's what somebody asked him a question if the natural birth requires water blood and spirit does not the spiritual birth require all these stages of grace before the person is truly born again absolutely i just explained that this morning the same on the same thing you've got to have all stages you're begotten of the spirit just like a baby's begotten into the wound of a mother but not born until they receive the holy ghost that's right in other words the baby's not gonna lie till it comes and you don't have any work you see holy ghost right right you're born again so you're not you're born then you're not converted right you're in the process of being converted until that time like a baby begotten in the wound of a mother you know the other day we would have turned in alabama and got the word that brother joe was going to be an uncle he's certainly not going to be a man they found out she's going to have a boy okay everybody got it i just use a stage of an uncle you know because that's what i told my wife and then when i said i go good i found out i have an uncle you know next door neighbor has nothing to do with i'm just making a point okay joe's gonna he's the daddy of the baby it's going to be a little boy everybody guys so it made him an uncle not an ain't all right yeah get all of it together but listen see three manifestations but that baby in the wound of a mother and that's why this prophet's message is so valuable see science says today that baby is alive right it's got a heartbeat that's got all of the things it can cry it can do everything but thank god for a prophet that's right that'll tell us that baby is not alive it's not a living soul until it's born from its mother and receives the breath of life you are not a living soul until you receive the breath of eternal life right that's what the scripture talking about he become a living soul adam become a living soul right amen but are you following me yes three stages of grace all right look at the next one number five we got just a little bit of future home but i'd ask you at least by wednesday for you to click over about page 15 14 15 the future home read it listen to the type and listen to brother around explain it and he's explaining the redemption of the world really as the point of his message and the future home etc and where we're going what's going to happen in the world but he said if you don't get nothing else get the plan of salvation that's right amen he could tie it all together so listen what he says now future home and notice how god makes plain to us the plan of redemption oh this just thrilled my shoulder and i saw it i'm explaining to us now his plan of redemption now compare what we see with our own eyes what god has done to redeem his world he's done the same plan to redeem his people for the unchangeable god changes not in any of his plans or anything such a glorious thing how he led us to himself to a tabernacle in us by the three stages of grace just like he led he's led the world in three stages to come to the world as god will come god will come to the world what after he's gone through three different stages of purification that's exactly how he comes to us through the three stages of grace i taught that at the beginning i've never changed since it's god's own word now there's two statements in there in the future home that he makes that identical statement right you know what they're saying now that brought around taught it one way now he's taught it another way they thought he said he taught the new birth his justification case the baptism in the holy ghost and you know but now in the end time message when they got the great revelation of what he was really saying that now they believe he was just teaching the baptism of the holy ghost you know it's the new birth well see all of that can be tied up into man's ideas of thinking and it confuses people right and that's what i said you ever heard him preach on the new birth i mean i'm just i'm talking to you honest i'm not being exalted or anything i'm just asking you a question you come from these other churches but did your pastor ever tell you about what it was to be justified or sanctified or filled with the holy ghost right well i'm sorry to be too blunt maybe they don't understand that's why they don't talk about it that's right oh that's the old days and old doctrine thing i still love it all right man i'm sitting there today and i thought why am i gonna listen to it i went to the fifth seal you know the longest fifth of six seal questions and answers in the seven seals what am i gonna listen to i just clicked that opponent 53 that's a good one presume it that was the message i love to hear those old messages i'm not in the doctrine or the message or the hour that claims it you know that you you can't believe nothing for the seagulls you got to get everything after the seal the son of man came to straighten brother branham i don't believe none of that amen garbage can to me all right but you see what i'm trying to get across the new birth that's right starts with justification that's right just like a baby starts when it's conceived in the mother's womb but it's not alive you say well they can show them crying that's all right because that's fine a dog you you look at the dog in there and it's doing the same thing monkey preach or whatever it's doing the same thing it's not a living soul that's right all right i'm not trying to straighten science out i'd run around wouldn't try and do anything just telling like it is right then when the baby's born or the dogs born or the cat's born or whatever a life comes into the animal right it becomes a living animal but a human being the life comes into their soul and they become a living soul all right and that's what he's trying to explain to nicodemus the name is your living soul right see we just read one little bit we read and we think that was all it said you think that that jesus turned around there you must be born again he gets up and walked out they probably sat for hours discussing this right but he couldn't comprehend it right and surely like jesus was saying with nicodemus you're a product of your mother you come through water you come through blood you come through life let's see we just read a little bit that was put in the words for us to read and then he was said well i know what you're saying is right and i can't understand it because you see they miss the kingdom they miss the thing that jesus was speaking of that the kingdom must come then it must be within you you know you've heard that argue presbyterian target right brother dick whether it was in jesus or within the people or just out here somewhere you know where is it jesus said it's within it was within him right amen but then he released it on the day of pentecost it came within the disciples he said what happened to them they had been justified they had been sanctified unless you thought of that but they were not born again that's right they had repented their sins they got baptized they've done all the things and they got sanctified the unclean spirit went out of them but yet right they were not born again now you do what you like but judas went through those stages too judas was there in the upper room washington let jesus wash his feet taking the bread to communion but then it entered into his heart because his heart was not born again truly you can see then in judas what happened the unclean spirit that had been driven out came back right and took up his abode and he went out and turned the lord jesus up oh they have stories now they got all about the judas movies they got the things that judas wouldn't such a bad guy i never have thrown off on him he was a human being he was a person oh you said yeah but he was a son of perdition i explained that all right explain that that's what i want answers i like answers to things i was when was judas the son of perdition well he was born now well so was you amen you're talking about me when you get your feelings hurt you know what it proves that i was right because if not you say amen amen because you realize where you come from that's right all right but you see we'll just touch this a little bit and quit run around there in the future home he said that there's nothing to your future right that's it he said just like it was with the world he said in the days of noah it was just washed off cleaned all the sin and all the garbage on it and it come forth a brand new world but it wasn't eternal he said that's what happens to you and i he said we see we're lost and we need to be saved and we repent and we follow after we get water baptized and you know we go home we believe the message of the hour but we've got to go home from there because the disciples believed all of that and walked with the lord jesus they had come to saint john 17. that the unclean spirit driven out of them by the word of jesus christ oh we preached sanctification you quit smoking you quit drinking quit chewing well i didn't do it was i saved all the time see that's where god puts people in a place sometimes that they can just blend right back out in your lap and ask you a question was i saying degree that i didn't drink no i didn't like the looks of the stuff and i didn't like what it done to people stumped to me he's always sweet to me yeah you're on the other side because something was done dealing with me maybe you didn't get your dealings till later on i've told you about it i go out the world do something wrong come home and feel dirty and even ask god to forgive me i could just tell you my life you know but i did a couple nights saying you're not saved if you've got the new birth you're saved no matter what you was behind that ain't got nothing to do with it right it's just god keeps some people maybe where they can tell it brother brown said that he wanted to drink he tried to he wanted to smoke god wouldn't let it come on read the message he kept him from doing it right to where he'd have a witness right that's it well maybe he kept me a little bit down through there i didn't say i was dirty enough guilty of the least his guilt in the hole right amen but it's just where somebody can talk yes right amen so you claim that's your salvation well i must have had it before you ever thought about it because i didn't do it but get what i'm saying justification god convicts you of your life that's right you go to the altar wherever you know it doesn't matter out in the woods i'm doing things you can be working god can speak to him you can do all that brother i remember him telling me about sitting out under the uh sitting kind of on the fence road or something nerdy house he said this is like rain water just coming down on me you know what sure you know everybody don't have the same experience now let me correct that order of saying it we all have the same experience but we have different manifestations right just no more than it's three works it's one word with three manifestations it's the same holy spirit that called you brother charlie cox went around and said but charlie said this god that called you and told you to turn around he said he'll call you one day and tell you to come up same god that calls you the same god's going to change amen right but you know what i'm talking about did you work have you ever just really got under conviction right yes the lord i'm sorry then that's why brother branham will say to a christian then sin becomes dirty now he didn't say he wasn't going to be tempted right it becomes dirty well because there's something about you this even at repentance you don't want to go back and do that again and you try to find somebody like wrote around the city you know the lord was dealing with him and he said he went down to this church it wasn't it went down to another one he even talked about going to the catholic yeah because he was catholic when they started he said it didn't happen well you know what he couldn't find a church yeah that spirit of elijah not as a new birth but that anointing upon him would not let him be satisfied in any of those churches because it would tell him the truth about it that's it he'd go to look at it you ever heard him tell about he said good lord i know i can't pray he said charles writes you a letter they wrote him a letter stuck it up on a tree hopefully he'd come by and read it you heard the story about the person that couldn't even do nothing but they just wrote down the abcs they get on the tree somewhere or something he said lord you just put the words they all are right you just put them together now i'm talking about a god that's real not just a fictitive of your imagination or a good thought or good reasonings or whatever all those are well and good but have you really ever been just fully convicted another dick was talking about somebody who wasn't a lady that and they asked about it she said well i'm born in church you know it's born here you know you could do that i was in the message right i mean i cut my teeth on the message pews you know but that don't save you but ronald even says if you women don't think cause you've got long hair and long dresses that you're going to heaven that's right that's what i said up there and i thought lord just give me some way to help those people that are not certain about where they stand that's right to where they can do what you need to do all right now then do what i'm saying just simply sitting right there in your seat if you're here or if you're on tape listening or whatever just simply say lord i believe something's been dealing with me or i wouldn't be concerned that's right right amen so lord forgive me of my sin but then you've got to believe that's that's the point you got to believe you said well i don't know whether he hurt me or not he hears that we know the prophet's word he hears everything he said he hears everything that's right don't you think he'd hear you lord i'm sorry that's right and remember it's his goodness that calls you to repentance it's his goodness that calls you right he's calling you can't come unless he's calling you right right but you how long you want to stay the word of prophet would say it like this so i said i don't know what to teach i want to try but he said every person in the world when i was a hot and taunt in africa and i just use that point i'm not against we'll say india why are those people worshiping idols you don't ever think about it why are they worshiping totem pope because your prophet said there's a soul in he said no there's just a chosen seeds only one cries out see you've listened to all that you got lost in your birth get born again you won't be worried about seed the truth will come to you because he's on her mount to bring you the truth if you're born again that's right make him lose language okay 1.4 inspired book 124 anybody has a need but just do what i say disabled lord i'm sorry you want to spray with yourself and why would you be calling out why do you have a desire makes you want to do good really nice me me he said what he needed was a touch for god to hit him in the body but really what all right let's just believe it we're going to give him a prayer claw and we're going that you may receive father heaven in the name of our lord and savior jesus christ we just asked the what because anybody the same party he said now don't get all messed up when this comes up today you don't know about the seven seal because you're gonna have to tell it first and when he concludes he says that go on with the same simple message did you take care of it with the same simple message because you don't you work yourself away from it justification sanctification by the baptism father son future home of the world redemption justification sanctification who is this mountaineering his justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost he's brought into a higher order everything is getting higher and higher you heard it probably say you don't leave your foundation now right this building's got one here we don't want the foundation to grow keep on going keep on believing something comes along tells you you're not worthy you know what i do when the devil tells me i'm not worthy i agree with him no boy you telling the truth and i know my word you're not telling me what god said watching that's perfect well we can't be perfect another friend said every morning again believer first seal ever born again believer truly born again believer is imperfect and almighty god let me say what he said me me oh me me me bye
