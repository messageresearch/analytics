[2:09] every need amongst us father God and
[2:10] Lord direct us for the rest of this
[2:12] weekend we pray
[2:13] in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen let's
[2:18] read first John chapter 1 Bible says
[2:21] that which was from the beginning which
[2:23] we have heard which we have seen with
[2:25] our eyes which we have looked upon and
[2:27] our hands have handled of the word of
[2:30] life for the life was manifested and we
[2:33] have seen it and bear witness and show
[2:36] unto you that eternal life and which was
[2:40] with the father and was manifested unto
[2:42] us that which we have seen and heard
[2:45] declare we unto you that ye also may
[2:48] have fellowship with us and truly our
[2:51] Fellowship is with the father and with
[2:53] his son Jesus Christ and these things
[2:56] write we unto you that your joy may be
[2:58] full
[2:59] this then is the message and that's the
[3:02] title of the of the sermon I want to
[3:04] give this this morning this then is the
[3:06] message which we have heard of him and
[3:09] declare unto you that God is light and
[3:12] in him is no darkness at all if we say
[3:16] that we have fellowship with him and
[3:18] walk in darkness we lie and do not the
[3:23] truth but if we walk in the light as he
[3:28] is in the light we have fellowship one
[3:31] with another and the blood of Jesus
[3:34] Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin
[3:38] if we say that we have no sin we deceive
[3:42] ourselves and the truth is not in us if
[3:46] we confess our sins he is faithful and
[3:49] just to forgive us our sins and to
[3:51] cleanse us from all unrighteousness if
[3:55] we say that we have not sinned we make
[3:58] him a liar and his word is not in us
[4:01] praise the Lord you may be seated this
[4:03] evening
[4:08] amen
[4:09] like I said I want to title this this
[4:12] then is the message amen and so and I
[4:17] guess for a subtitle is walking in the
[4:19] light amen we we we know Saints and we
[4:23] live in dark days
[4:25] very very dark days and in very strange
[4:28] days to say the least
[4:31] you know the more and more every day I
[4:33] wake up the more and more of a clown
[4:34] world I feel that we live in it's a
[4:38] clown world out there I mean it's just
[4:39] incredibly what what's going on out
[4:41] there and and and there seems no end to
[4:46] it it seems like but you know what for
[4:49] for the believer and for each and every
[4:51] one of us those things should be causing
[4:55] us to make us feel less and less
[4:56] comfortable in this life it should it
[5:00] should it should let us see and let us
[5:02] know hey this is not my world this is
[5:06] not my my this is not what I'm just a
[5:09] pilgrim here on earth just walking
[5:11] passing through amen and growing in the
[5:14] Lord and because there's something
[5:16] better out there see because we're
[5:19] groaning and travailing for something
[5:21] greater and something better that means
[5:23] that that is out there for us because if
[5:25] it wasn't out there for us we wouldn't
[5:27] be groaning for it you see you see we
[5:30] were grown for life we grown for none of
[5:33] us want to die we grown for life because
[5:36] there's life out there for us you see
[5:38] and so and so as dark as the world is
[5:43] getting amen and as and and and and we
[5:46] see just pitch darkness but look the
[5:49] Bible says that in the evening time
[5:51] there will be light amen
[5:53] in the evening time there is a people
[5:56] that is going to shine bright delight
[5:58] and and to think that is you and I and
[6:02] desire Saints there out in the middle of
[6:05] the people riding and and and all kinds
[6:07] of the things going on and taking place
[6:10] out in the cities there is a people that
[6:13] can turn on the light a man that can
[6:16] call upon the name of the Lord and those
[6:19] people out there and they don't need
[6:21] they don't need more politics they don't
[6:23] need more more more more things of the
[6:27] world to they need Jesus Christ
[6:30] and who is Jesus Christ in this ours you
[6:33] and I Saints Christ in in flesh who you
[6:37] who has the Holy Spirit in your life
[6:40] it's sad to see the people that the way
[6:43] they're walking and to think that that
[6:45] if this thing keeps going and that my
[6:47] children have to live in something like
[6:49] this for the next you know and I just
[6:52] say Lord just come quickly come quickly
[6:55] because this is not this is not what I
[6:57] desire amen
[6:59] so well let's talk about this light then
[7:02] amen and I want us to go to Genesis
[7:05] chapter 1 Genesis chapter 1 let's start
[7:08] from there from the beginning amen now
[7:12] several years ago I ministered a message
[7:14] called when God saw the light and maybe
[7:17] at another time we might touch that in
[7:19] more detail so we're just taking little
[7:21] bits and pieces from it but let's see
[7:25] where the Lord leads us so if the
[7:26] brothers could bring up Genesis chapter
[7:28] 1 the Bible says they're very familiar
[7:31] scripture to us in the beginning God
[7:33] created the heaven and the earth
[7:35] amen and the earth was without form and
[7:39] void and darkness was upon the face of
[7:42] the deep and the Spirit of God moved
[7:44] upon the face of the waters and God said
[7:48] let there be light and there was light
[7:51] period I mean it had to come because God
[7:56] said and therefore it needed to be
[7:57] manifested you see and God saw the light
[8:00] that it was good and God divided the
[8:02] light from the darkness and God called
[8:04] the light day and the darkness he called
[8:06] night and the evening in the morning
[8:08] were the first day now I want us to
[8:11] think Saints that and I want us to
[8:13] concentrate and just look at verse 3
[8:14] here that God said let there be light
[8:17] and light is the vindication of us of
[8:21] the spoken word Saints when God said let
[8:25] there be light
[8:25] amen they had to come to pass the fact
[8:29] that the light appeared amen it was the
[8:32] proof that God spoke you see so that's
[8:36] the reason why now I don't want us to
[8:39] get confused with this light here in
[8:42] verse 3 is
[8:43] not the Sun and is not the moon and is
[8:45] not the stars at this point God was not
[8:48] creating the Sun Moon and stars if you
[8:51] read later down in the chapter you will
[8:53] see that God later creates that the
[8:56] great light of the day which is the Sun
[8:58] and then the great the the lesser light
[9:01] of the night which is the moon and then
[9:03] the stars so so but so let's ask the
[9:07] question then what is this light when
[9:10] God said let there be light
[9:12] what is this light amen because see it
[9:16] appeared and in this light it was the
[9:19] origin the origins of everything that is
[9:22] here on earth amen and you and I Saints
[9:26] were in that light but potentially we
[9:30] were in there amen so let's look more
[9:33] further what that light Amen so when God
[9:35] said let there be light and I want to
[9:37] try to just simplify this as much as I
[9:40] can so that even the younger one here
[9:43] can maybe understand when God said let
[9:47] there be light two things happen first
[9:51] and foremost the thought of God was
[9:53] expressed amen
[9:55] and what happened was that the logos
[9:58] came out of God now what is the logos
[10:01] the logos all the logos is is the Greek
[10:04] word for the word word in fruit and if
[10:08] when you read John chapter 1 where it
[10:10] says in the beginning was the word that
[10:13] means in the beginning was the logos
[10:15] amen and the logos was with God and the
[10:18] logos was God amen so that logos came
[10:22] for now it wasn't two people then no it
[10:26] wasn't two people it was the same God he
[10:29] made manifest for extension of God amen
[10:32] because he needed to have a body because
[10:35] the Bible says there when you read in
[10:38] Genesis chapter 1 it says and the earth
[10:40] was without form and void and darkness
[10:42] was upon the face of the and the Spirit
[10:45] of God moved upon the face of the waters
[10:47] so in spirit form God was not going to
[10:51] be able to create the only way he could
[10:54] create was he take a body form amen
[10:57] so that's what stepped out of God when
[10:59] he said let there be light and Jesus
[11:02] Christ came on the scene the logos came
[11:05] on the scene is that simple enough amen
[11:08] because after that that's when God could
[11:11] create then because the next thing he
[11:14] was create was tangible things after
[11:16] that amen and he is just as tangible as
[11:19] you and I are Saints amen
[11:21] he's not some sort of spirit just
[11:23] floating around just just just oh you
[11:26] know some ghost of some sort though
[11:28] that's no he is just as human as you are
[11:31] but yet he is just as God as each one of
[11:34] us with the Holy Ghost amen
[11:37] and he wants us to look at him that way
[11:39] not just some ghost
[11:42] that's not my god I got is a human being
[11:46] and not just that amen he's a young
[11:48] human being as well amen
[11:51] he's not no old man sitting on the chair
[11:53] up there just kind of kind of like the
[11:58] way I see brother Bob you know when he
[12:00] does his beard to live every now and
[12:01] then not be back there or maybe Josh no
[12:06] he's not like that amen
[12:08] God is young amen and so if he's younger
[12:12] if he if we're expecting to be young
[12:15] again amen then are we gonna go to from
[12:18] young to see an old God an old no we're
[12:21] gonna see a young one
[12:22] he's got the Bible says we're gonna be
[12:24] just like him amen
[12:26] praise the Lord now I wouldn't even go
[12:28] in there but praise God anyways amen so
[12:31] when God said let there be light the
[12:33] first thing that burst forth was that
[12:35] logos now that logos is that light and
[12:39] that logos which is Jesus Christ is the
[12:42] life that logos is the word expressed or
[12:45] the word the word manifested because God
[12:48] said then the word manifested that was
[12:51] Jesus Christ amen praise God amen now
[12:55] again as I said because Jesus since
[12:58] Jesus's life the creation could not have
[13:01] continued that that light was not
[13:03] manifested first see the work that he's
[13:06] tangible amen
[13:07] there was not going to be any mountains
[13:09] no trees no no
[13:10] no living creatures or anything as such
[13:12] if God did not take on a form of body
[13:15] form amen right and in the form of Jesus
[13:17] Christ they meant the Bible says even if
[13:20] we read in John chapter one another very
[13:24] familiar scripture to us John chapter
[13:26] one the Bible says in the beginning was
[13:28] the word and the Word was with God and
[13:31] the Word was God again in the beginning
[13:34] was the logos and the logos was with God
[13:37] and the logos was God amen the same was
[13:42] in the beginning with God in other words
[13:45] he's always been there see to us we
[13:48] can't fathom that I says human beings
[13:50] we're so used to something's born and
[13:52] then dies
[13:53] something's born lives and dies some
[13:57] even little animals but to think that
[13:59] God's always been and that he had
[14:02] attributes within himself that he needed
[14:04] to manifest and you and I were part of
[14:09] those attributes see if he did not take
[14:12] that body former that logos didn't come
[14:14] out of God that if Jesus Christ didn't
[14:16] come out that way then you and me were
[14:18] wouldn't we wouldn't come come to be you
[14:21] see our bodies were laying here on the
[14:24] earth amen potentially they were so in
[14:29] order for those seeds that God had
[14:31] already planted amen in order for them
[14:34] to spring up amen the logos had to come
[14:36] forth they meant to shine that light
[14:38] over those seeds you see you don't want
[14:40] to seed when you plant a seed it's not
[14:42] going to come forth if you plant it
[14:44] somewhere out in the basement somewhere
[14:46] you see if you put seed in a basement in
[14:49] a dark basement in a dark place it is
[14:53] not gonna grow no matter how much you
[14:54] put water in it it needs also light and
[14:59] that's the same thing with each and
[15:00] every one of us Saints we the weird we
[15:03] also need the light of the word every
[15:05] single day in order for us to grow you
[15:08] can read you can you can you can water
[15:11] it and you can water but and that's just
[15:14] maybe just reading the word and just
[15:17] studying amen but you also need the
[15:20] present light of the word
[15:21] Amen in your life in other words coming
[15:24] to church amen and and being and being
[15:26] partaker of what's going on amen you
[15:30] need to be active in other words the son
[15:32] is active amen and you need to be an
[15:36] active part of the body see in order for
[15:40] you to grow amen all things verse three
[15:44] and fruit and John chapter one all
[15:46] things the Bible says were made by him
[15:49] see so so we're made by who by this
[15:52] logos or by Jesus Christ by this light
[15:56] or by this life amen by the word and
[16:00] without him was not anything made that
[16:03] was made
[16:04] so who created the heavens and the earth
[16:06] our Lord Jesus Christ amen
[16:10] and in him was life and the life was the
[16:15] light of men
[16:17] and the light shineth in darkness and
[16:21] the darkness comprehended it not now
[16:25] we're going to notice that when you read
[16:27] there in Genesis chapter one that when
[16:29] that light was manifested immediately
[16:31] God separated the light from the
[16:34] darkness
[16:34] see wherever there's light darkness
[16:39] can't understand it that's the reason
[16:42] why the Bible says that no man
[16:43] understands it's unnatural for a man us
[16:50] as human regular beans coming to this
[16:52] earth it's unnatural for us to
[16:54] understand the things of God because we
[16:57] are born in sin shaped in iniquity we
[16:59] come into this world speaking lies we
[17:01] come into this we're already in darkness
[17:04] amen and we're going to look at
[17:06] something here in just a moment but we
[17:08] come into this world already in darkness
[17:10] and that's the reason why we don't
[17:12] understand the word and we don't
[17:14] understand God we don't understand what
[17:17] these things are all about it's because
[17:18] you need the light of God to shine upon
[17:20] that amen if God's light amen Jesus
[17:24] Christ who is the word shines on on the
[17:27] word that you're receiving then it comes
[17:29] into manifestation then
[17:31] then it comes into into fruition you see
[17:33] other than that it's just you reading
[17:35] the word it's just you reading the
[17:38] letter see I could read the Bible from
[17:40] Genesis to Revelation every single day
[17:43] every single hour every single second
[17:46] but if God doesn't shed light on that
[17:48] word that I'm reading it's no good to
[17:50] him because God that word has to pop out
[17:53] from the pages of the Bible and needs to
[17:56] walk and step in flesh and do things and
[17:59] move and be you see what I'm saying it
[18:01] needs to move and it also needs to
[18:05] create atmospheres because wherever the
[18:08] Word of God is a man if it's in you it
[18:10] creates an atmosphere and it should be a
[18:14] positive they should be a positive
[18:18] atmosphere when Jesus Christ came on the
[18:22] scene here in Genesis 1 it was a
[18:25] positive atmospheres that came forth
[18:27] after that because he is the light and
[18:30] if that light is in you they manage to
[18:32] create a positive atmosphere around you
[18:35] amen god help us with that because we we
[18:38] that's the thing that's why we're
[18:39] scaling this up that this the Statue of
[18:42] a perfect man amen alright so Jesus is
[18:49] the beginning of the creation of God we
[18:50] can read there in Revelation chapter 3
[18:52] verse 14 and unto the Angel of the
[18:54] Church of the Lord seein's write these
[18:56] things at the Amen the faithful and true
[18:58] witness the beginning of the creation of
[19:01] God see that was Jesus Christ saying
[19:04] that their Bible says by him all things
[19:08] were created that are in heaven and
[19:10] there are in Earth in Colossians chapter
[19:12] 1 verse let's just start at verse 15
[19:15] well let's just start at verse 12 given
[19:18] thanks unto the Father which have made
[19:20] us meet to be partakers of the
[19:21] inheritance of the Saints in light who
[19:24] hath delivered us from the power of
[19:26] darkness and hath translated us into the
[19:29] kingdom of his dear son in whom we have
[19:33] redemption through his blood even the
[19:36] forgiveness of sins aren't you thankful
[19:37] for that
[19:38] oh my praise God that Amen there still
[19:41] forgiveness
[19:42] they're still mercy for you they're
[19:45] still grace in this hour that's only if
[19:47] you want if you don't want it it's not
[19:50] there for you see God cannot force you
[19:53] to do or believe his word amen he gives
[19:57] it to you he offers it to you but it's
[19:59] up to you to take it and say lord I
[20:01] believe that and I'll take that promise
[20:04] to my heart and and live and live it
[20:07] amen
[20:08] then God can do something that that's
[20:10] God then manifest in his light on the
[20:12] word that you're receiving you see who
[20:16] is that verse 15 who is the image of the
[20:18] invisible God the firstborn of every
[20:20] Christian or very creature this is
[20:22] talking about Jesus Christ he's the
[20:24] firstborn of every creature see he was
[20:26] the first being that stepped out of the
[20:29] Father amen that's the reason why the
[20:32] Bible says he is the image of the
[20:34] invisible God the firstborn of every
[20:35] creature the Bible becomes a little bit
[20:39] more simple doesn't a man let's just ask
[20:42] God to reveal the word to us for by him
[20:44] we're all things created that are in
[20:47] heaven and that are in earth visible and
[20:51] invisible whether they be Thrones or
[20:54] dominions or principalities or powers
[20:56] all things were created by him and for
[21:00] him amen and you know what Saints if
[21:04] they're for him
[21:05] then they're ours too if you have God in
[21:10] you amen if these things belong to him
[21:12] then they belong to you if that same
[21:15] light that same life is in you a man
[21:18] those things Thrones dominions powers
[21:20] everything visible and invisible is all
[21:23] belongs to you - the Bible says that the
[21:26] earth the Saints shall possess the earth
[21:29] amen this is our home one day heaven and
[21:34] earth will kiss together amen it'll just
[21:37] be glorious then and there will be no no
[21:40] autonomous cities or and there'll be no
[21:42] black and white race thing or nothing
[21:44] like that a meadow just he'll be one
[21:46] language the language of love and Christ
[21:49] is the king and his children will be
[21:51] reigning amen forevermore
[21:53] praise God sick and tired of all these
[21:57] things politics and all these things
[22:00] going on I'm ready to go home
[22:02] amen praise God and the Bible says in
[22:06] verse 17 and he is before all things and
[22:09] by him all things consist
[22:13] in other words everything lives because
[22:16] he is the source of life amen he is the
[22:20] light you see everything lives
[22:22] biologically here on this earth because
[22:25] that big ball of fire is still sitting
[22:27] up there up in the sky you see because
[22:31] as long as it's up there there's gonna
[22:34] be life here on earth but as but if it
[22:36] goes away there's no life amen so as
[22:40] long as Christ is there and he's alive
[22:42] amen there's life amen
[22:44] praise God and he is to be manifested
[22:48] he's always wanted to manifest himself
[22:50] in flesh so even though we don't see him
[22:54] physically amen amen he's in his people
[22:57] right now see right now he's walking in
[23:00] human vessels in the Bride of Christ and
[23:02] you and I who have that life in us
[23:05] praise God amen look what the Prophet
[23:09] says here in the message there is a man
[23:11] here that can turn on the light God said
[23:13] let there be light
[23:15] now what if he just said it and no light
[23:18] come then we don't know whether it's
[23:21] true or not we don't know whether he is
[23:24] all right we don't know whether he is
[23:26] God or not because he just said let
[23:28] there be and there wasn't see so so then
[23:32] when God speaks and we see it is then
[23:36] that's the light that shines forth the
[23:39] truth of the word see there is light in
[23:42] life hey man so God is not a liar so
[23:48] when he said let there be light
[23:50] there was no lie in there it had to be
[23:55] it had to take place he had to come
[23:56] forth you see so that's the reason why
[24:01] he's the Bible says that he is the way
[24:03] the truth the truth and the life
[24:07] see because everything that comes forth
[24:10] from him amen
[24:11] every piece every one he said let there
[24:14] be a man it had to be praise God
[24:18] so when God said let there be light and
[24:20] light appeared you think about it Saints
[24:23] God light appeared when there was no
[24:26] light think about that I alway maybe it
[24:31] was just maybe in the image in the mind
[24:32] of God you see but something came out of
[24:36] nothing I'd rather believe that then
[24:41] believe something happened in some sort
[24:42] of explosion happened the galaxies away
[24:44] and they created the order that we are
[24:47] in now I just don't think that that can
[24:52] be every explosion that I've seen causes
[24:55] chaos every explosion that I've seen
[25:00] causes things to move everywhere and and
[25:03] and and it just causes destruction and
[25:06] chaos amen
[25:08] but this was no explosion amen the thing
[25:11] that happened as always was God spoke a
[25:14] man the eternal beam that was there amen
[25:16] he spoke it and it came to be I'd rather
[25:21] believe that and that same beam as in me
[25:26] and you what this evening praise God so
[25:28] something happened light came on the
[25:31] scene life came on the scene when there
[25:33] was no evidence of it you see same thing
[25:36] with the virgin birth see the the the
[25:39] the the prophets of the Old Testament
[25:40] spoke for me for years thousands of
[25:44] years and then Isaiah came on the scene
[25:46] and he said a virgin shall conceive
[25:50] sounded pretty strange it sounded kind
[25:53] of weird there's no such a thing that
[25:54] it's taking place but then one day it
[25:58] happened in virgin in the in the Mary
[26:00] came and came on the scene she had to
[26:02] come on the scene first right she had to
[26:05] come in and things had to be in a
[26:08] certain order and then that word that
[26:10] Isaiah spoke a man manifested in in them
[26:13] in the life of Marilyn
[26:15] and something happened when there was no
[26:18] evidence of it to happen but that was
[26:20] the manifestation of that spoken word
[26:22] when it actually happened that was that
[26:25] spoken word being manifest you see Amen
[26:28] that was that spoken word being
[26:31] manifested and I'll Mary could say was
[26:33] be it unto me according to thy word see
[26:36] that's how we get is the Bride of Christ
[26:38] could say be it unto me Lord I don't see
[26:41] the evidence of it I don't see the the
[26:44] physical things of it but but Lord be it
[26:46] unto me because you promised it in your
[26:48] word and your word cannot lie and when
[26:51] you said in the beginning let there be a
[26:52] man and there was I believe that the
[26:54] same thing can happen to me Amen that if
[26:57] I repent of my sins and be baptized in
[27:00] the name of Lord Jesus Christ for the
[27:01] remission of your sins that I shall
[27:03] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that
[27:05] is the promise of God therefore I'm
[27:07] gonna believe it Lord therefore I'm
[27:09] gonna act upon it and you watch it
[27:11] manifest in your life
[27:12] I believe that amen praise God so Jesus
[27:21] Christ the light of the world came on
[27:23] the scene through that virgin birth a
[27:26] spoken word that was spoken amen right
[27:28] now I want us to look here at just a
[27:31] moment of a type of you and me here for
[27:34] just a moment and and let's let's look
[27:37] here at Genesis chapter 1 again because
[27:42] there in Genesis chapter 1 the Bible
[27:44] says there in the beginning God created
[27:46] the heaven and the earth now in the
[27:49] beginning amen you came on the scene as
[27:53] some sort at some point in time I came
[27:55] on the scene my physical body came on
[27:57] the scene in 1980 yes
[28:00] brother Wade said I'm a baby I'll be
[28:03] probably 40 years old next month now
[28:09] there's some that are older than me here
[28:11] some that are younger than me I won't
[28:16] reveal ages but I know brother Dale
[28:18] doesn't mind he he doesn't mind to
[28:20] reveal his age because it brings wisdom
[28:25] amen but I know some of you sisters
[28:28] don't like that so so I as the Bible
[28:38] says here in Genesis chapter 1 in the
[28:39] beginning God created the heaven and the
[28:41] earth in the beginning there was at some
[28:44] point in time you came on the scene amen
[28:46] there was one point in time you came and
[28:48] seen and verse 2 it says and the earth
[28:50] was without form and void amen now God
[28:53] had you on his mind before the
[28:55] foundation of the world the Bible says
[28:57] that amen and he had everything and then
[29:00] in his mind before the foundation of the
[29:02] world amen but and but he had
[29:04] predestinated some of us amen to be to
[29:07] be to be to come to where we are now
[29:09] amen I believe that with all of my heart
[29:12] and the Bible says there in verse 2 and
[29:14] the earth was without form and void I
[29:17] want you to notice that the earth was
[29:20] without form and void each and every one
[29:21] of us that have come here that are
[29:23] living right now at some point in time
[29:24] you were to form and you were you have
[29:27] no form and you had in you were void
[29:31] contrary to what a lot of people may say
[29:33] that you came here with some seed or
[29:35] something inside of your heart physical
[29:37] none of us were seeking God none of us
[29:40] were looking for God the Bible says the
[29:42] Bible says that all we like sheep have
[29:44] gone astray
[29:46] none of us and none of us we're looking
[29:48] for God when we came here to earth we
[29:52] were and the earth was without form and
[29:54] void see our bodies are connected to
[29:57] this earth we have a connection to this
[30:00] earth and so we came here just as the
[30:03] earth was I without without boy without
[30:06] form and void we were without form and
[30:08] void
[30:09] you were not seeking God you never in
[30:12] your life has sought God it was always
[30:15] God seeking you Bible says in Isaiah as
[30:19] all we like sheep have gone astray we
[30:22] have turned every one to his own way and
[30:24] the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity
[30:26] of us off on him on Jesus isaiah 64:6
[30:30] tells us but we but we are all as
[30:34] unclean thing
[30:36] it doesn't doesn't say some of us were
[30:39] an unclean thing that says but we are
[30:41] all as an unclean thing and all our
[30:45] righteousnesses are as filthy rags so
[30:48] what does that mean in other words the
[30:50] good things that you've done here on
[30:51] this life since you were born
[30:53] those things are just like filthy rags
[30:55] before God's eyes they won't get you
[30:59] into heaven nothing good that you can do
[31:02] will get you in we'll get you favor for
[31:04] God from God there's no way because then
[31:08] it breaks what the Bible says here
[31:09] they're all of our righteousnesses are
[31:12] like filthy rags and we all do fade as a
[31:16] leaf and our iniquities like the wind
[31:18] have taken us away in psalm 51:5 says
[31:22] behold I was shapen in iniquity and then
[31:24] sin that my mother conceived me so we
[31:28] came here
[31:28] amen void in chaos out of order no order
[31:36] in our lives you see just like the earth
[31:40] came in that way amen that's how our
[31:43] life was whoever says that came here
[31:47] perfect and then it's spotless amen
[31:50] they are lying to you because the Bible
[31:53] says country amen so ok let's continue
[31:58] reading and darkness was upon the face
[32:00] of the deep man there was darkness in
[32:03] your life I don't think that when I was
[32:05] out there drinking and smoking and
[32:07] hanging out with girls and doing all
[32:09] these things that I used to do I don't
[32:11] think that that was that was light I
[32:14] don't think I don't think any rational
[32:16] person would think that those things are
[32:18] like no that's darkness and you you know
[32:22] what you were doing amen but that if
[32:24] it's under the blood praise God
[32:26] it's under the blood God doesn't
[32:28] remember it one bit
[32:30] so he's probably wondering why are you
[32:33] bringing it up right now it's all under
[32:36] the blood but just trying to help just
[32:39] trying to help you they're everything
[32:41] that we did amen
[32:42] it was darkness and was no life amen and
[32:45] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[32:47] and the Spirit of God moved upon the
[32:50] face of the waters now that to me that
[32:54] that reminds me of for example as I was
[32:56] growing up many times I had the
[32:59] opportunity to come closer to God the
[33:02] spirit may be moving in our midst
[33:05] maybe maybe you were you grew up from up
[33:08] from a from a little baby you grew up in
[33:10] church and the Spirit of God moving as
[33:13] the words going forth the spirit of
[33:15] God's moving but if it's not doing
[33:16] anything in your life that means light
[33:18] hasn't struck there yet that means you
[33:21] haven't heard let there be light you see
[33:26] the spirit of God's always moving God's
[33:29] always given us chances each and every
[33:32] one of us to come to God amen
[33:34] and though in the word is being sown the
[33:38] word is constantly being sown the son of
[33:41] man is constantly sawn the word through
[33:43] the preaching through the things that
[33:45] you hear through a podcast or through
[33:48] something it's constantly being sown but
[33:51] if the light doesn't shine upon those
[33:53] seeds that you're lit that you're
[33:54] hearing it won't brings forth any life
[33:56] in your life that's the reason why you
[33:59] keep going the way you're going and it's
[34:01] a cycle of rebellion and a cycle of hate
[34:06] and a cycle of of my own thing and then
[34:09] this is what I want to do it means
[34:11] because light hasn't struck on that life
[34:13] at amen
[34:15] but when God says let there be light
[34:18] light has to come to appear amen when
[34:22] God says let there be light life has to
[34:25] spring up in your life and what does
[34:27] that mean amen maybe when you were in a
[34:30] service and all of a sudden the preacher
[34:32] says something and something sparks in
[34:34] your life and that revelation comes into
[34:36] your life and you say that's exactly
[34:37] what I've been trying to look for all
[34:40] this mall is my life that life
[34:44] Christ comes into manifestation then you
[34:47] see just as God said let there be light
[34:51] the logos came out the life came out
[34:54] Jesus Christ came out that word came
[34:56] into manifestation a man would that's
[34:58] when God a man could start working on
[35:00] you then but until then it's just the
[35:03] Spirit of God moving upon the waters and
[35:06] you see in the Bible says that waters
[35:08] represents peoples you see so the Spirit
[35:11] of God is moving upon the people
[35:13] amen that's what some people maybe they
[35:15] might jump and shout and scream and that
[35:17] to just beyond the flesh I could just be
[35:19] in the spirit realm you see but that
[35:22] doesn't necessarily mean there's a
[35:24] change in their life because when God is
[35:26] manifested on the scene when God is
[35:28] revealed when Jesus Christ is revealed
[35:30] amen a change of life takes place do you
[35:35] see what I'm saying
[35:35] I hope that you're understanding what
[35:37] I'm trying to say you see because after
[35:41] Christ who came on the scene the locals
[35:44] came on the scene then that's when
[35:46] things started to become more clearly
[35:48] then then God said let there be
[35:50] let there be let there be amen and
[35:53] that's when God starts saying let there
[35:55] be
[35:56] let there be let there be let there be
[35:59] let there be let there be until
[36:00] everything starts coming into fruition
[36:02] in your life praise God
[36:05] amen amen
[36:09] praise God so and brother Branham says
[36:14] in Christ mystery of God revealed what
[36:16] is then you birthed then you say well
[36:18] brother Branham what is the new birth it
[36:20] is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[36:22] personally to you see as Genesis as
[36:25] Genesis 3 I mean as Genesis 1:3 when God
[36:29] said let there be light that was a
[36:31] revelation of Jesus Christ then do you
[36:34] see and so what is the what is light in
[36:38] your life true light in your life is
[36:40] when Christ is revealed through your
[36:42] life see this word when you read it and
[36:46] you say Lord it's revealed to me now
[36:48] it's gonna make you act upon what you
[36:50] read if you were lying if you were
[36:53] cheating if you were if you were
[36:55] listening to hip-hop music if you were
[36:57] if you're listening
[36:58] rock-and-roll music if you were engaged
[37:00] in drugs it doesn't matter what it is
[37:02] Amen it's gonna cause you to put some
[37:04] things down it's gonna cause some action
[37:07] in your life amen
[37:09] because it's Jesus Christ revealed in
[37:11] your life amen praise the Lord Jesus
[37:14] amen
[37:16] so the Bible says here in rep and 2nd
[37:23] Peter 3:9 that the Lord is not slack
[37:25] concerning his promise as some men count
[37:28] slackness but he's long-suffering
[37:30] towards word not willing that any should
[37:32] perish but that all should come to
[37:34] repentance see God's given he's given
[37:37] everybody a chance see the Bible says
[37:40] that he's died he died for many he died
[37:44] for the whole world but he the Bible
[37:47] says he died for many because he knew
[37:49] who was going to accept him amen praise
[37:51] God Hebrews 1:2 hath in these last days
[37:55] spoken unto us by his son whom he hath
[37:58] appointed heir of all things by whom
[38:00] also he made the world's a man praise
[38:03] God
[38:04] so Jesus Christ is that life that light
[38:09] which comes by the spoken word to the
[38:12] believer by faith see each one of these
[38:19] words that was that was written amen
[38:21] they were spoken word amen when the word
[38:25] is going forth as a minister's preaching
[38:27] that's a spoken word if it's the Word of
[38:29] God if he's preaching the Word of God
[38:32] all right and so you can grab onto that
[38:36] word by faith and receive the benefits
[38:38] of it or you don't or not or you could
[38:43] just disbelieve it amen that's the
[38:45] reason why in Hebrews 1 or 11:1 says
[38:47] that faith is the substance of things
[38:50] hoped for the evidence of things not
[38:53] seen so where are we born again we are
[38:55] born again at faith amen
[38:59] it's something that you don't smell see
[39:02] taste or feel as a matter of fact as I
[39:06] mentioned last sermon we can't hardly
[39:08] explain what happened to us in the new
[39:10] birth
[39:11] we just know that it happened because
[39:14] the effects of it started taking place
[39:16] in our life when you we used to cut up
[39:18] and when we used to smoke weed and when
[39:21] we used to drink alcohol and when we
[39:23] used to be running around with women and
[39:25] doing all kinds of things all those
[39:27] things started to be laying aside Lord I
[39:30] don't I don't I don't desire those
[39:32] things anymore
[39:33] Lord there's something you know I'll
[39:37] just say this you know as own ups but
[39:40] but when I was younger when I was
[39:42] younger and I started I heard this
[39:44] message my mom and dad didn't tell me
[39:46] that's quit certain doing certain things
[39:47] and stuff like that you know it was just
[39:51] it was the Lord just dealing with me and
[39:53] certainly see we all came into the
[39:55] message at the same time I didn't grow
[39:57] up in the message you see we all came in
[40:00] at the same time but God was dealing
[40:02] with me I guess more in a in in a in a
[40:06] in a faster way than he was at the time
[40:08] - my mom my dad and my sisters because I
[40:11] was really soaking up this word amen and
[40:13] I was I've always been that way as a
[40:16] little as young you know just looking
[40:19] into the word and then when I found that
[40:20] when the message came into my life I was
[40:22] just soaking it up but you know and I
[40:25] used to all go around you know with with
[40:27] shorts on and then and things like that
[40:29] you know that's not just like a regular
[40:31] guy out there you know saying is sagging
[40:33] my pants sagging my shorts out in the
[40:35] basketball goal courts and stuff like
[40:38] that you know how they do you know but
[40:41] then one time when I heard brother
[40:43] Brennan said you know you sissies
[40:44] winning no shorts and all those types of
[40:46] things
[40:46] my mom is my mama doesn't say not one
[40:48] thing to me I just heard that word and I
[40:51] said you know what I don't want to wear
[40:52] that anymore
[40:53] and from there that's when it stopped
[40:56] see ya now that was just that was that
[41:00] was just me you see that was the word
[41:03] Amen so that is why you are born again
[41:08] at faith see that's when the light of
[41:12] God comes in or the Holy Ghost or Christ
[41:16] Himself comes into the believer by the
[41:18] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen at faith
[41:21] so it's something that you can occur
[41:24] you cannot Stacy's smell feel it's
[41:27] something that just happened to you and
[41:29] you see the effects of it afterwards you
[41:31] see you'll see the effects of it but the
[41:34] by but you have to continue in that word
[41:37] Amen so when God shines light on his own
[41:41] word to you then you can see it and it's
[41:46] revealed to you you see as maybe the
[41:49] sermon is going forth then if God shines
[41:53] light on that then you'll be able to see
[41:55] it then other than that it might just go
[41:58] over your head but God a man is prepared
[42:03] God has his light there Amen all you
[42:05] have to do is just be available to it
[42:08] Amen just be available to it see when
[42:11] the light doesn't shine on the word then
[42:13] there is no life that comes in there see
[42:15] because like we said the the fact that
[42:19] the light appears is because it's the
[42:21] manifestation of that spoken word you
[42:23] see that's the reason why it manifests
[42:26] amen
[42:28] I can see some of you are just trying
[42:29] hard to stay awake praise the Lord
[42:34] keep it up alright let's read to hear
[42:39] something that brother Branham said here
[42:40] and we're we're gonna try to finish up
[42:44] soon bro Brown says here in the message
[42:46] there is a man that can turn on the
[42:48] light so life is only by the Word of God
[42:51] made manifest life comes only by the
[42:55] Word of God made manifest as long as it
[42:58] is just in the book like this it still
[43:02] can be questioned see as long as it's
[43:05] just here in the book it needs to be
[43:08] lived a man it just doesn't need to be
[43:11] stay in the book amen the same thing
[43:14] with the message it needs to be lived it
[43:17] needs to be it needs to be acted upon it
[43:20] needs to be seen by the word by the
[43:23] world out here that's dying in darkness
[43:26] that little light that you show forth
[43:29] amen that might be the only light that
[43:32] they might see there a whole lifetime
[43:34] amen
[43:35] it needs to be lived so as long as it is
[43:38] just in the book like this it still can
[43:39] be questioned but when it's made
[43:41] manifest then you see the product of
[43:44] what it spoke of being manifested then
[43:47] that is light on the word you see that's
[43:52] the same thing it is in the word see the
[43:55] word is God and when the life strikes it
[43:59] it brings it light strikes it brings the
[44:03] word to life again
[44:05] Genesis 1:3 he meant when God said let
[44:09] there be light there was life amen every
[44:12] age has always been that oh how we
[44:14] appreciate these great things how that
[44:16] the word being vindicated is the light
[44:18] of the spoken word see now watch this
[44:21] and it takes the light of God to strike
[44:23] the word to make it live in other words
[44:26] Jesus Christ on the scene revealing his
[44:29] own word in order for that word to live
[44:32] amen here's what he spoke now let the
[44:36] light shine Amen let the light shine and
[44:38] the light will bring every word to its
[44:40] right position in its season amen oh you
[44:44] see when it comes time and spiritual
[44:47] life eternal life can only come by God's
[44:50] spoken word of life why because he is
[44:53] life it's all Christ he is the life he
[44:58] is the light life was the sol in this
[45:02] time in him is light and in him is no
[45:04] darkness and He is God spoken light is
[45:07] that right God spoken word for in the
[45:11] beginning was the word and the Word was
[45:12] with God and the Word was God and it's
[45:14] forever God see amen so it's all the
[45:19] life in the light in the word in Jesus
[45:22] Christ it's all that's all in you Christ
[45:27] revealing himself through your life and
[45:30] every time that you read this word it
[45:33] should because it should be a new book
[45:34] to you every day it should be something
[45:37] it should be it should be a greater
[45:39] thing opening up to you because then if
[45:44] we're if we're coming to a point where I
[45:46] just seems like everything's the same
[45:48] everything we need to go back or see
[45:50] where we left the lie
[45:52] wherever we left the light a man that's
[45:55] where we need to go back to it and the
[45:58] light his the light is in the word amen
[46:01] so wherever you left that light that's
[46:03] where you need to go back to it now in
[46:05] verse 4 there in Genesis and God saw the
[46:08] light that it was good and God divided
[46:10] the light from the darkness so every
[46:14] time that the light shines forth in your
[46:16] life and God is working in your life God
[46:19] is manifesting themselves through your
[46:21] life there has to be a separation you
[46:24] can't be the same person you can't be
[46:27] acting the same way and you can't think
[46:29] the same way there has to be a
[46:31] separation I could not continue going on
[46:34] with my friends and acquaintances that I
[46:36] had when I came to the Lord because that
[46:40] wasn't compatible with me anymore as a
[46:43] matter of fact most of them I never left
[46:45] them they left me and if that's not
[46:48] happening to you man then son then you
[46:51] just might you just might be in the same
[46:53] darkness and area all blind leading the
[46:56] blind yeah yeah yeah well when light
[47:03] shines amen just like that bug amen at
[47:07] night something's that something
[47:10] attracts them about that light you see
[47:12] and it gives near and closer and closer
[47:15] until they can't even leave it anymore
[47:16] then the next day you find them dead on
[47:19] the ground and that's I should be with
[47:21] you and me completely dead when you when
[47:24] you come to the light of God's Word amen
[47:27] you're gonna be dead in Christ amen
[47:30] completely dead to this world and it
[47:33] doesn't matter the owner of the house
[47:34] may come in my goodness that bug was a
[47:37] huge bug this big it was just sitting
[47:39] around that light just enjoying it so
[47:41] look at him now the world might say oh
[47:44] poor thing poor thing but and you're
[47:47] you're dead in Christ nothing bothers
[47:49] you anymore amen the world doesn't have
[47:52] anything no hold against you because
[47:54] you've seen the light you've gone to the
[47:56] light and you've experienced the warmth
[47:58] you've experienced it's raised you
[48:01] for instance spiritual healing that
[48:04] caused you to die amen
[48:07] we could put it forth that way so God
[48:10] calls for a total separation from
[48:12] darkness 2nd Corinthians 6:14 says be ye
[48:14] not unequally yoked together with
[48:16] unbelievers amen
[48:21] hmm for what fellowship hath
[48:24] righteousness with unrighteousness and
[48:27] what communion hath light with darkness
[48:30] I didn't say it Jesus Christ said it
[48:36] that's what Christ said so if we're
[48:41] feeling good around unbelievers and
[48:43] you're supposed to say that you're a
[48:45] Christian and you're manifesting the
[48:46] word of light and you just feel good
[48:49] around them to do everything and take a
[48:51] social drink with them and do everything
[48:53] within the darkness is overtaking you
[48:56] you're not overtaking the light's not
[48:59] overtaking the dart your darkness
[49:00] overtaking you here comes that that
[49:02] thing over the candle to put that light
[49:05] out see you're not being a witness
[49:09] you're not being a witness John 1:5 says
[49:12] and the light shine if and darkness and
[49:14] the darkness comprehended it not there's
[49:18] got to be a separation that's the reason
[49:21] why the the other day when we're talking
[49:23] to the young people somebody is somebody
[49:25] there was a question about it's can we
[49:28] listen to Christian rap now I grew up
[49:33] with hip-hop music I grew up with rap I
[49:35] used to listen to what ankling and all
[49:38] these others - all those groups and all
[49:39] that stuff ok maybe some of y'all don't
[49:45] know what that is and you don't don't
[49:47] worry about it David nothing good there
[49:53] but I asked him and I said all right
[49:56] well what about if we go out here and
[50:00] commit a Christian murder
[50:03] what about if we go out here and commit
[50:05] a Christian lie or say a Christian lie
[50:08] is there such thing as a Christian lie
[50:10] or listen let's go let's go and let's
[50:13] commit on a Christian adultery there's
[50:17] no such a teen just because you put the
[50:20] word Christian over the thing doesn't
[50:22] make it Christian it's still the same
[50:25] spirit it's still the same the same beat
[50:28] it's still the same dance moves it's
[50:30] still the same thing just because they
[50:32] said Jesus for a few times does not make
[50:35] it part of the word part of the light it
[50:40] makes it word Li and when you were and
[50:42] when you're listening to it out there in
[50:43] the street whether you're with you with
[50:45] your windows down and you're it makes
[50:48] the same beat as it does if you were
[50:50] listening to Christian too to the
[50:52] regular hip-hop and the person next to
[50:54] you would not even know the difference
[50:57] would not even know the difference so is
[51:01] it something good for a Christian to
[51:03] listen to Christian rap I say it isn't
[51:05] but you know what Jesus Christ has to
[51:08] reveal that to you personally
[51:09] you see because I can listen to anything
[51:13] I want to I can go out here and smoke
[51:16] cigarettes and buy and drink alcohol and
[51:20] I can go to the club I can do anything I
[51:22] want to the problem is is that I don't
[51:24] want to that's the problem because
[51:29] blight has struck light has shined light
[51:32] has been revealed in my life and I don't
[51:35] want to do those things see that's a
[51:38] total difference you you you can do
[51:41] whatever you want to you can but when
[51:46] Christ comes on the scene in your life
[51:48] for real and it's truly revealed you do
[51:51] not want to do those things again amen
[51:54] praise God there is a separation there
[51:59] is a separation that's why in from the
[52:01] beginning there was a separation from
[52:03] light from darkness and that separation
[52:05] has to keep moving on until we get out
[52:08] of here Saint Matt and have no
[52:10] fellowship with the unfruitful works of
[52:12] darkness
[52:13] Ephesians 5:11 says but
[52:16] rather reproved them in other words
[52:19] exposed them don't have any fellowship
[52:22] with him
[52:22] amen now we're gonna rub shoulders with
[52:25] the world we have to work with with
[52:29] people that don't don't profess to be
[52:31] Christians we work with people that that
[52:34] believe other things and things like
[52:35] that but I believe that you might be
[52:38] there to be that light for them that
[52:41] opportunity for them don't beat us know
[52:44] it no stick your nose up and say I'm a
[52:46] Christian and I believe crap because
[52:48] that's not the Spirit of Christ either
[52:50] that's not the Spirit of Christ either
[52:53] amen
[52:54] all right so with this we're gonna
[52:56] finish here let's just look go back to
[52:59] first John chapter 1 and I just want us
[53:02] to take this here verse by verse first
[53:05] John chapter 1 that which was from the
[53:07] beginning so what was from the beginning
[53:13] Jesus Christ was from the beginning amen
[53:16] you read that in John and you read that
[53:19] in Genesis that which was from the
[53:22] beginning which we have heard which we
[53:25] have seen with our eyes you see this is
[53:27] John speaking here this is John writing
[53:29] because John was one of the disciples
[53:31] that walked with Christ so he has a
[53:34] revelation that that Christ was the one
[53:37] from the beginning the creator of
[53:39] heavens and earth that's why he wrote in
[53:41] John the book of John in the beginning
[53:43] was the word amen
[53:46] that which was from the beginning which
[53:48] we have heard which we have seen with
[53:49] our eyes which we have looked upon in
[53:51] our hands have handled of the word of
[53:53] life amen
[53:55] see they touched Jesus Christ they lived
[53:58] with him and they that the the physical
[54:00] body of Jesus Christ here on earth they
[54:03] were there with him Maya would have been
[54:05] marvelous to be in that way amen praise
[54:09] God but it's greater amen to have Christ
[54:12] in me that's a great hey then you know
[54:16] it's great that I could touch Jesus
[54:18] Christ you know I can hug him and and
[54:20] things like that
[54:21] Amen but a man to have him living in me
[54:24] and that life is just the same life that
[54:27] he lived a man that's a greater thing
[54:29] you see because when the spirit of a
[54:32] rapper is in you you're gonna act like a
[54:33] rapper or a spirit or a rockstar is
[54:36] gonna you gonna add like a rockstar but
[54:37] when the Spirit of Christ is in you
[54:38] you're gonna add like rice you're gonna
[54:40] live like Christ you're gonna think like
[54:42] Christ you see but that's that's a
[54:45] greater thing to have the Spirit of
[54:48] Christ in you for the life was
[54:49] manifested and we have seen it see and
[54:52] bear witness and show unto you that
[54:54] eternal life which was with the father
[54:58] say he's going back to the beginning and
[55:00] was manifested unto us so it was
[55:03] manifested there with the Father now as
[55:05] it was manifested there to them in it on
[55:08] earth and now it's manifested to us
[55:10] through the eternal life you see that
[55:13] which we have seen and heard declare we
[55:15] unto you that ye also may have
[55:18] fellowship with us and truly our
[55:19] Fellowship is with the father and with
[55:22] his son Jesus Christ there's not two
[55:24] different people here the same person is
[55:28] with the father and when you're
[55:30] worshiping the the father you're
[55:32] worshiping Christ when you're worshiping
[55:33] Christ you're worshiping the Father I
[55:35] see and these things right we unto you
[55:38] that your joy may be full this is the
[55:40] purpose why he wrote this so that you
[55:42] can be happy in Christ not sad this
[55:47] makes me happy
[55:49] this makes me look forward to the things
[55:50] knowing come what may Amen I got great
[55:53] things coming in store for me and then
[55:55] for the Bride of Christ let it happen
[55:58] look whatever happens they could have
[55:59] autonomous cities in every corner I
[56:01] don't care
[56:02] Amen I want to see God on the scene amen
[56:05] praise God this then is the message
[56:08] which we have heard of him and declare
[56:10] unto you that God is light and in him is
[56:14] no darkness at all all right so we've
[56:16] established that where where if there's
[56:19] lighting you there should not be any
[56:21] darkness singer because if God was light
[56:24] there was no darkness in him that's the
[56:26] reason why things came into fruition
[56:28] things were manifested trees animals
[56:31] Birds mountains and all different things
[56:34] came forth because that was all part of
[56:37] the light
[56:38] light is the life amen if we say that we
[56:41] have fellowship with him and walk in
[56:43] darkness we lie and do not the truth I
[56:46] don't think I have to explain that if
[56:50] you say that you love God and you're
[56:51] walking with him and you're walking in
[56:53] darkness amen
[56:54] then there's you're lying and you're not
[56:57] doing the truth and he is the truth now
[57:01] but if we walk in the light as he is in
[57:04] the light in other words if you're
[57:07] walking in the life as he is in the life
[57:11] or he is the life amen
[57:14] if you walking in the light of the word
[57:17] for your day because sometimes we can
[57:20] walk in the light of the word for
[57:22] another day and that's not going to help
[57:24] us right you see sometimes we the
[57:28] message that that was for for Luther or
[57:32] Wesley that can't help us now
[57:35] we still glean from that light but we
[57:38] need to be walking in the revealed Word
[57:40] of your day amen in the revealed word
[57:44] for your day because Jesus Christ is
[57:46] moving Christ his movement so that's
[57:49] what the Bible says if we walk in the
[57:51] light as he is moving because he is the
[57:55] light as you're walking in here may
[57:57] meant the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses
[57:58] us from all sin we have fellowship one
[58:02] with another amen we can't be living in
[58:06] the glare of another day amen
[58:09] it was great what happened in the 50s
[58:11] and it was great what happened in the
[58:13] 60s it was awesome and I wish I was
[58:16] there yeah
[58:17] sister Clara got to see those days her
[58:20] sister here got to see those days and
[58:22] some of you were there got to see great
[58:24] things taking place amen but amen those
[58:30] things are to bring us to where we are
[58:32] now because the light keeps unfolding
[58:35] you see light becomes greater and
[58:39] greater and greater and it wasn't just
[58:41] that light there it meant that was light
[58:43] but that light has become greater amen
[58:46] and it wants to manifest itself in this
[58:48] hour amen
[58:49] so you have to walk in the
[58:51] for your day and when you're walking
[58:53] into life for your day the Bible says
[58:56] but if we walk in the light as he is in
[58:58] the light we have fellowship one with
[59:00] another see we in other words we have
[59:03] something in common with each other and
[59:05] we have something in common with Christ
[59:08] we have fellowship one with another with
[59:11] him and whether with each other and the
[59:13] blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses
[59:15] us from all sin
[59:17] amen if we say that we have no sin we
[59:21] deceive ourselves and the truth is not
[59:23] in us amen
[59:26] I mean there was a quote here I was want
[59:28] to read here real quick Bible says he oh
[59:30] brother and says here then if we are
[59:32] walking in the god-given light of the
[59:34] hour then God takes that word that's
[59:37] given for the hour and vindicates it
[59:40] amen
[59:41] praise God see just like he did in
[59:46] Genesis 1:3 he said let there be light
[59:48] and light come forth see that was the
[59:51] vindication of that spoken word his word
[59:54] went forth and light followed it and
[59:56] cleared away the mist and the darkness
[1:00:00] went to one corner and the light shined
[1:00:02] on the other side and then that's what
[1:00:05] walking in the light is in other words
[1:00:08] that one when that light came to the
[1:00:09] manifestation there in Genesis 1:3 the
[1:00:11] mist had to roll away that's why there
[1:00:14] was that separation and if you're
[1:00:16] walking in the light as he is in the
[1:00:18] light amen
[1:00:19] things start coming off of your life
[1:00:21] amen as you're walking up the statue of
[1:00:24] a perfect man amen amen
[1:00:26] lust starts coming off your life amen
[1:00:28] and all kinds of things and you're
[1:00:30] gaining more virtue and you're getting
[1:00:31] more knowledge and temperance and things
[1:00:33] and things just start coming off of your
[1:00:35] life and the blood of Jesus Christ is
[1:00:37] cleansing you amen from all
[1:00:38] unrighteousness amen
[1:00:41] but that's it's walking in the light of
[1:00:43] the day
[1:00:45] praise God if we say that we have no sin
[1:00:49] we deceive ourselves and the truth is
[1:00:51] not in us and if but if we confess our
[1:00:55] sins he is faithful and just to forgive
[1:00:58] us for our sins the problem is is that
[1:01:01] we don't confess
[1:01:03] right we want to hold things because we
[1:01:06] think that God won't here where it won't
[1:01:08] hear us we fail him and we do I'll be
[1:01:13] the first one to tell you how I fell him
[1:01:14] many times
[1:01:16] matter of fact many times even in one
[1:01:18] day I fell but I know that the light of
[1:01:22] the word says something different the
[1:01:25] light of the word says that if I confess
[1:01:26] my sins in other words if I confess my
[1:01:29] unbelief he is faithful and just to
[1:01:32] forgive me of my unbelief and to cleanse
[1:01:37] me from all unrighteousness amen and
[1:01:41] then when you go to God with that he'll
[1:01:45] just bring that into manifestation in
[1:01:47] your life he'll reveal that to you
[1:01:51] and that that'll say that that is like
[1:01:54] him saying let there be light and there
[1:01:56] was life there was there's the
[1:01:58] forgiveness I've already done it for you
[1:02:01] all you have to just say I'll just has
[1:02:02] to say is confess that's all you have to
[1:02:05] do amen if we say that we have not
[1:02:08] sinned we make him a liar and his word
[1:02:11] is not in us so I don't I think that we
[1:02:21] we need to always recognize that we're
[1:02:23] frail and without him we're nothing amen
[1:02:27] without him we are nothing so so Saints
[1:02:32] that is the message this is the message
[1:02:35] amen amen just keep walking in the light
[1:02:39] a man as he is in the light and I
[1:02:41] believe that you're gonna be gaining
[1:02:43] more exposure of that light amen until
[1:02:46] one day a man will just meet him in the
[1:02:48] air meet the actual light up in the air
[1:02:52] amen
[1:02:53] and we'll be caught up with each and
[1:02:55] every one of those Saints they were
[1:02:56] resurrected a man will be caught up and
[1:02:58] meet him in the air amen and the Bible
[1:03:00] talks about that that there at the end
[1:03:02] in Revelation it talks about that in the
[1:03:04] city there was not going to be no need
[1:03:06] of the moon and the Sun or anything as
[1:03:08] such because he is gonna be the light
[1:03:11] amen praise God and we're gonna be right
[1:03:14] there
[1:03:14] him shining forth just as he is amen
[1:03:18] now that light is not got minutes its
[1:03:20] its life in other words there will be
[1:03:23] complete life no death whatsoever nobody
[1:03:27] dying no more sickness no more pain no
[1:03:30] more suffering no more people being
[1:03:33] being destroyed or being cheated or
[1:03:36] anything as such I'm looking forward to
[1:03:41] that sense I'm looking forward to that
[1:03:44] and if that light is in you that's what
[1:03:48] you would be desiring as well let the

[1:11:31] today we would pray over these prayer
[1:11:33] cloths and you sisters need to take
[1:11:35] where you're going put these over the
[1:11:37] door under the bed under the under the
[1:11:40] floor mat going underneath and put one
[1:11:43] in your car the same way with us man
[1:11:46] we're gonna do the same thing we're
[1:11:48] gonna put these prayer cloths we believe
[1:11:50] in them for those of you that are new we
[1:11:52] in acts 19 they took cloths off of Paul
[1:11:54] and evil spirits were driven away we've
[1:11:57] seen cancer we've seen man completely
[1:12:00] healed with cancer by just praying over
[1:12:02] a prayer cloth and giving it to him he
[1:12:04] putting it in his billfold he lived nine
[1:12:05] years late after from what team the
[1:12:07] doctor told him he was going to die in
[1:12:09] three months he lived for nine years so
[1:12:11] we believe that we've seen backaches
[1:12:13] we've seen people's lives changed by
[1:12:16] these things right here so we sure
[1:12:19] believe it's not the cloth it's the
[1:12:21] prayer behind the cloth but it is a
[1:12:23] contact brother John it's a contact
[1:12:25] between between us and who we're going
[1:12:28] to give it to so I thought to the
[1:12:29] tonight we would if we get them
[1:12:31] the church to come up and or at least
[1:12:34] the ministers and will pray over these
[1:12:36] prayer cloths the sisters are leaving
