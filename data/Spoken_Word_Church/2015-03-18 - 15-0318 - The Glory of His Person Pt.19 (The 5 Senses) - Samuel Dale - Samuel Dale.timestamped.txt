[3:11] 1 Genesis 3 and 2 Corinthians 11 we want

[4:03] now to just come and speak to our hearts
[4:05] as to what to say to your people and may
[4:07] we be gathered tonight together around
[4:10] you which is the word we love you and we
[4:12] thank you forgive our sins and cleanse
[4:15] us remember the sick among us remember
[4:17] your promise that you sent your word and
[4:19] healed us and we believe it father keep
[4:22] us now in your grace and love in Jesus
[4:25] name
[4:28] amen revelation Ians 1 that we've been
[4:32] reading verse 12 and I turned to see the
[4:34] voice that spake with me and being
[4:36] turned I saw seven golden
[4:39] candlesticks and in the midst of the
[4:40] seven candlesticks one lik un to the son
[4:42] of man clothed with a garment down to
[4:45] the foot and G about the paps with a
[4:48] golden girdle now let's go to
[4:53] Genesis and we'll go to chapter
[4:56] three we will not be getting into
[5:00] necessarily a lot of the natural because
[5:03] I want to make sure we understand what
[5:06] we're talking about cuz everybody's
[5:08] preached to you what happened in the
[5:10] garden you know you should be enough to
[5:12] believe that and as adults talk about it
[5:15] but I want to make sure we understand
[5:17] really the whole situation so Genesis
[5:22] 31 now the serpent was more subtle than
[5:25] any beast of the field which the Lord
[5:27] God had made and he said unto the woman
[5:31] y hath God said ye shall not eat of
[5:33] every tree of the garden remember he's
[5:36] talking to her now she starts preaching
[5:38] and the woman said unto the serpent we
[5:40] may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the
[5:42] garden but the fruit of the tree which
[5:44] is in the midst of the garden God ha
[5:47] said ye shall not eat of it neither
[5:51] shall ye touch it lest you die and the
[5:53] serpent said unto the woman you shall
[5:55] not surely die for God doth know that in
[5:58] the day you eat thereof then your eyes
[6:01] shall be opened and you shall be as Gods
[6:04] knowing good and
[6:06] evil and when the woman saw that the
[6:09] tree was good for food and that it was
[6:11] pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be
[6:13] desired to make one wise she took of the
[6:16] fruit thereof and did eat and gave also
[6:19] unto her husband with her and he did eat
[6:22] and the eyes of them both were opened
[6:24] and they knew that they were naked and
[6:26] they sewed fig leaves together and made
[6:29] themselves aprons all right now let's go
[6:36] into second
[6:38] Corinthians
[6:40] 11 we'll go with verse two for I am
[6:44] jealous over you with Godly jealousy for
[6:46] I have espoused you to one husband that
[6:48] I may present you as Chase ver as a
[6:50] Chase virgin to Christ but I fear lest
[6:53] by any means as the serpent serpent
[6:56] begal Eve through his subtility
[7:00] so your mind should be corrupted from
[7:02] the Simplicity that is in Christ you may
[7:06] be seated the Lord add his Blessing to
[7:09] the reading of the word now as I said we
[7:14] want to try to continue our thought
[7:17] on the kind of the style that we were
[7:20] talking uh Sunday and getting to a place
[7:24] to to understand and I went back and and
[7:28] viewed most of that service this
[7:30] afternoon to try to pull my mind back in
[7:34] to a thought and uh I would hope you
[7:37] would listen to it and uh you know
[7:41] review it because that's what we make
[7:43] them for and then that way you wouldn't
[7:45] be well I don't know what he means well
[7:49] if you listen you can pretty well tell
[7:50] what I mean that's that's one thing I've
[7:53] noticed that I am very very blunt now in
[7:56] the basis of the way I say things and
[7:59] and uh it's done for that purpose that
[8:02] you and I should not be
[8:05] deceived now we think about ourselves oh
[8:10] I can't be deceived I'm a predestinated
[8:14] seed
[8:17] well just
[8:20] remember there are also some that are
[8:22] predestinated under rep
[8:24] probation so you might want to make up
[8:28] your mind which side you're own and
[8:30] remember that if you reject the
[8:34] word then you prove which sides you're
[8:37] on I mean no problem if we reject the
[8:40] word we prove what we are okay so then
[8:43] that would would run into that Rim all
[8:46] right but now did you follow what I was
[8:50] trying to say I hope you did through the
[8:53] message our Sunday afternoon especially
[8:56] when we were talking about that Eve was
[8:58] made per
[9:00] perfect she was not made in in a way
[9:04] like we think I've heard the people of
[9:06] the message express it and listening to
[9:09] them that that you know it looks like
[9:12] they're trying to say that brother
[9:14] brandham even said you know that Eve was
[9:17] made a certain
[9:19] way and them describing Eve making a
[9:22] certain way would mean that God made her
[9:25] a certain way so she would fall well now
[9:29] I don't agree with that because if he
[9:32] made her in any form whatsoever in a
[9:37] wrong way then he cannot judge her for
[9:41] being wrong I hope you get that embedded
[9:45] into your mind you know to understand
[9:49] because that would make God the author
[9:52] of the the the part being wrong and that
[9:55] can't be it was the way he would have to
[9:58] make her as
[10:00] perfect and then give her a
[10:02] choice and her choice would would bring
[10:05] the downfall of that but we want to try
[10:08] to put it on a basis in our thinking
[10:11] that there was something
[10:13] wrong well if you're going to do that
[10:17] then uh we might as well forget it eat
[10:21] drink and be married cuz tomorrow we die
[10:23] forget it you know but to think about it
[10:28] maybe you've heard heard it maybe that's
[10:29] the way you
[10:31] think you know maybe you think that a
[10:34] way maybe that's the reason I'm trying
[10:37] to nail it down so hard because I want
[10:40] you to at least know where I stand then
[10:43] that way you can do what you want to
[10:45] what you believe right all right because
[10:48] if Eve was made in any form
[10:51] wrong right then you can't judge her for
[10:57] being wrong amen right all right and
[11:01] remember it's so beautiful that she was
[11:03] not even taken I know everybody wants to
[11:05] use that byproduct I know what brother
[11:07] brandom is saying about it that she was
[11:10] not in the original creation but
[11:12] remember she was in him in Adam in the
[11:14] original
[11:16] creation well you don't hear that you
[11:19] don't hear people talk about how she was
[11:21] in Adam you just hear them talk about
[11:24] she wasn't in you women y'all wasn't in
[11:26] original
[11:27] creation but makes yall a
[11:32] byproduct and like I say and I put it on
[11:34] every tape when I mention it go home get
[11:36] your Dictionary look up
[11:39] byproduct I don't have to look it up I
[11:41] know what it
[11:44] means
[11:46] well maybe you ought to read a little
[11:48] bit about the prophet maybe you ought to
[11:50] run in some of the things that he says
[11:53] like I was looking at one and I'd be
[11:55] glad to look these up for you if you
[11:57] question me on it because looking at one
[12:00] there the other day where he was talking
[12:02] about and he said see said she was in
[12:05] Adam in the original creation but said
[12:08] she was not made her own Identity or
[12:11] person he said she was a
[12:16] byproduct but a byproduct means that
[12:18] that product came from Adam well like I
[12:21] said Sunday I ain't put it in there I
[12:23] was listening I was laughing in my own
[12:25] ways I guess but you know we think about
[12:28] Eve be Adam being male and
[12:31] female so I guess the rib that was taken
[12:34] out of Adam was a feminist
[12:36] rib all the rest of them was masculine
[12:39] you remember that
[12:40] Sunday I I try to make those points to
[12:43] get you to think you
[12:46] know and if Eve was made wrong she came
[12:49] from Adam that's right that's right then
[12:52] that make Adam created
[12:55] wrong you see that it doesn't pan out it
[12:59] won't work but we think we have it all
[13:02] figured
[13:05] out because it we never knew about these
[13:08] things until the prophet
[13:11] came right then once we heard what he
[13:15] said then we conclude that we've got it
[13:18] figured out
[13:19] now you know and then we can take all
[13:23] that Old Testament Bunch back there and
[13:25] say well look back there woman wouldn't
[13:27] even count it back there she wouldn't
[13:28] even recorded she would nothing she
[13:31] did well you know they must have had
[13:33] pretty good the idea
[13:35] too you know what I mean
[13:40] right I don't see how that you
[13:44] could I love my
[13:47] wife and I wouldn't do anything at all
[13:49] to harm
[13:51] her you know and and if I would love my
[13:55] wife like that do you think if I was in
[13:58] the old test I'd treat her any
[14:02] different I kind of like sometimes what
[14:05] I view and all and I know it's not good
[14:07] but I remember seeing in a movie one day
[14:10] and they were talking about this this uh
[14:14] chief of the tribe or something or
[14:15] something and then I can't remember the
[14:17] whole story cuz it doesn't matter but
[14:19] the point is is what he said the guy
[14:21] that was talking to him said you don't
[14:22] have one wife and said you're allow
[14:25] polygamy he said my wife don't like that
[14:27] idea
[14:29] well I thought that pretty good you know
[14:32] well evidently he loved his wife and
[14:34] didn't want to act that way but see we
[14:36] we want to make make it something to
[14:40] where that we've got it figured
[14:43] out and and we think we know the story
[14:46] so we try to back it background it and
[14:49] build it up with our own thoughts and
[14:52] ideas but if Eve was made in body wrong
[14:56] she can't be judged if she was made made
[14:58] in spirit wrong she can't be judged if
[15:02] she was made in Soul wrong she can't be
[15:06] judged all right amen and Adam the Bible
[15:11] says was not
[15:15] deceived all right and whether you
[15:17] listen to what I was saying or not
[15:21] remember they wouldn't have been no Adam
[15:24] and Eve if the minute Eve
[15:27] sinned
[15:32] right the second she sinned she would
[15:35] have been
[15:38] annihilated right right but how come she
[15:42] wasn't annihilated I mean naturally why
[15:44] wasn't she
[15:46] annihilated because the Bible said that
[15:48] he stood as a lamb slain before the
[15:51] foundation of the world cuz he knew what
[15:53] he was going to do he knew Eve would sin
[15:56] and go wrong he knew that right
[15:59] all
[16:00] right and in knowing that then he would
[16:03] have it prepared as a covering for her
[16:07] amen right
[16:10] right you see we don't we don't listen
[16:13] we don't think a lot of times but
[16:16] understand what I'm trying my best to
[16:18] bring to
[16:20] you Eve was Body Spirit and soul
[16:25] Eve body coming from the rib of Adam
[16:28] right
[16:30] spirit and soul coming from almighty
[16:35] God the same as Adam was Body Spirit and
[16:39] soul body by
[16:44] creation spirit and soul coming from
[16:47] God made him Adam then God breathed in
[16:51] his nostrils and he became a living Soul
[16:54] an eternal person that's right well I
[16:56] told you Sunday whether you agree or
[16:58] whatever you going to do uh I believe
[17:01] Eve was the same way cuz what are you
[17:03] going to do that's right I proved I
[17:06] think my point to where brother Randon
[17:08] said that Eve was still in theophany
[17:11] right the part of Adam that's right all
[17:15] right
[17:16] now you can go all the way back you can
[17:19] get a lot of quotes from brother
[17:20] brandham because I was looking at them
[17:22] today for a moment there that he speaks
[17:25] of Adam and Eve being the same person
[17:28] yep amen and just divide it out then it
[17:31] becomes Adam and Eve but just remember
[17:34] when they were divided out it become
[17:35] Adam and
[17:37] Eve all right then she was the byproduct
[17:41] yeah she came from Adam but her soul and
[17:45] her spirit didn't come from Adam it come
[17:48] from God Amen all right so then we've
[17:51] got to leave it that way are we going to
[17:54] have to go into some other form or
[17:56] something to try to understand
[17:59] but
[18:01] now you follow
[18:05] me if we can
[18:07] see remember the background now
[18:11] what the background of all of this is
[18:15] man made in the image of
[18:18] God you remember if we can see what the
[18:22] man is we know what God is if we can see
[18:26] what God is we know what the man is
[18:28] because it's the same image all right
[18:32] now I
[18:34] believe that if we look at Eve in the
[18:36] right understanding and that's what I
[18:38] was trying to bring out
[18:40] Sunday and to see what went wrong with
[18:44] Eve we can see what's going wrong with
[18:51] us I mean that's the only way I can
[18:53] explain
[18:54] it is to look and see what went wrong
[18:56] with Eve and then I can look look and
[18:58] see what WR went wrong with you and I or
[19:00] is going wrong with you and I and I hope
[19:03] to Heaven I know I said it in there a
[19:04] couple of times I hope to Heaven that
[19:06] you never get so super religious until
[19:09] you think that you don't do wrong that's
[19:14] right cuz you know where that I can
[19:16] quote from Brother brandham when they
[19:18] said do you sin he said every day that's
[19:22] right but yet right above there he said
[19:25] he lives so close to God he forced the
[19:27] gift to work
[19:29] what about a man living that close but
[19:31] yet admitting where he was
[19:33] at what about the great Apostle Paul
[19:37] when he was speaking of life and man and
[19:39] he comes out he said of Sinners I'm
[19:42] Chief oh that was
[19:45] before well you talk to Paul about it
[19:48] no he said he was
[19:51] Chief you remember the old Indian that
[19:54] brother random laid a lot of emphasis on
[19:57] after me receive holy
[20:00] ghost in me two
[20:02] people one does
[20:05] good other one does bad white dog black
[20:08] dog which one wins Chief want I feed the
[20:13] most Paul said what the things I do I
[20:16] would not the things I want to do I
[20:18] can't do them I'm all tied up in this
[20:23] situation he said well then from the
[20:25] inward man I serve the law of God but
[20:27] from the outward man I serve the law of
[20:28] the
[20:30] flesh just don't ever get it into your
[20:32] mind that you're so super religious
[20:34] until you don't do wrong right because
[20:38] I'll show you if you'd like this I was
[20:40] looking at it today brother Brown said
[20:42] eve thought she was
[20:47] right he said and the
[20:54] church thinks she's right
[20:59] is any way to convince the church
[21:00] they're wrong I don't care where you
[21:02] want to call them uh Baptist Methodist
[21:04] Presbyterian Catholics or branhamites or
[21:07] Lula
[21:08] ites right you know
[21:11] what people that get in their mind that
[21:14] they're right you're not going to change
[21:20] them I was thinking about it as I was
[21:22] talking about Eve being the first woman
[21:24] preacher and I said and she was
[21:27] anointed
[21:28] now brother Brown said that's why you
[21:30] can't I knowth that not he said you
[21:32] can't tell that woman it's wrong for her
[21:34] to do them things he said cuz she's
[21:37] anointed you go tell a woman preacher
[21:40] she ain't called to preach you know what
[21:42] brother brandom said one day he said I'm
[21:45] not going to tell
[21:47] you that God didn't call
[21:50] you now come on you don't need to quote
[21:53] he
[21:54] said but it's not in his word amen
[21:58] that's right right well you know what he
[22:00] just laying it right back in your La
[22:01] said all right you going to take the
[22:02] word you're going to take what you
[22:03] believe and I'm
[22:05] anointed you think you can convince
[22:08] preachers that they're
[22:10] wrong I've tried it for years and failed
[22:13] on every one of them
[22:15] so I just put it that
[22:18] way all
[22:21] right you said well what if you're wrong
[22:23] well okay I'm wrong no problem now what
[22:25] you going to do about it see that's your
[22:28] choice all right but now
[22:33] look let's get into the thought now with
[22:36] a background that we had of trying to
[22:39] bring of how Eve was not made wrong she
[22:42] was made
[22:43] correctly and how that Satan would look
[22:46] at her body and I emphasized that Sunday
[22:50] that he looked at her body he couldn't
[22:52] find any
[22:54] inroad because according to the
[22:57] scripture sure the body without the
[22:59] spirit is what dead all right so there
[23:02] no problem there so we need to get away
[23:05] from that bodily thoughts we
[23:08] have right cuz your body sisters
[23:12] brothers can't you you can't function on
[23:14] any form without something motivating
[23:16] you in natural life or what kind of life
[23:19] you want to make
[23:21] it so it's not the body the problem n
[23:25] that's right the body you remember how I
[23:28] was trying to bring that the body only
[23:30] displays the it's uh what is sin sin is
[23:34] not drinking gambling smoking run around
[23:36] with women what that's attributes of
[23:39] unbelief the body only displays what
[23:42] something motivates that to
[23:45] do all right so then you're going to
[23:48] have to go inward to find out where the
[23:51] problem is at so I order to do away with
[23:54] the fleshly things that we can all just
[23:56] thing that's oh well we we know know now
[23:59] wasn't eatting no apple well we got that
[24:02] well you know what I've told it and I
[24:04] don't mind keeping on telling it my mom
[24:06] told my daddy that they ate an apple in
[24:08] the garden and he laughed at her and he
[24:11] told her what
[24:14] happened now I don't believe he was a
[24:18] prophet I'm just saying he had common
[24:22] sense if you want to learn a little bit
[24:24] about what happened in the garden just
[24:25] go down and buy your Playboy magazine
[24:30] somebody in that realm has come up with
[24:32] a lot of things with snakes and women
[24:35] and all kind of
[24:38] things ain't going to gra no okay you're
[24:41] so super
[24:43] religious I was sitting down there one
[24:45] day in an office in a little cubicle
[24:47] thing and I was preaching on the
[24:48] pyramids and most of you heard me say it
[24:51] and I don't mind saying it I'm telling
[24:52] it for the truth and this man this buddy
[24:55] of mine he said he said I got to play
[24:57] boy magazine got an article on the
[25:00] pyramids I said bring it and let me read
[25:04] it so I was sitting in the boss's office
[25:06] and most of the time I didn't do a whole
[25:09] lot cuz boss didn't know what we was
[25:10] doing and he had to depend on me so you
[25:12] know I got a lot of setting around
[25:14] reading time and if brother collie was
[25:16] here he aen it cuz I stayed up in the
[25:17] tire backing with him about half the
[25:19] time me and him talking about the Lord
[25:21] but this other man right next boy he
[25:24] come over and he looked over in that
[25:25] thing and oh the preachers got the
[25:29] Playboy magazine come here everybody
[25:33] this was a white guy the black guy was
[25:36] when that brought it to
[25:39] me he didn't gently explain it to the
[25:43] guy he grabbed that guy and shoved him
[25:45] against that office and he said I
[25:49] brought the Playboy magazine to him
[25:51] there's an article in there on what he's
[25:53] preaching on and you shut up you know
[25:54] nobody never mentioned that
[25:56] again
[25:59] sure I mean he did if Tom was here he
[26:02] could tell you who the guy was and that
[26:04] that done it and how the guy told him
[26:07] said Sam's a great guy I wasn't care
[26:11] about the Playboy magazine I was
[26:12] interested in any article I could find
[26:14] upon those things and there was some
[26:16] good written news in there all
[26:20] right but see we can be so super
[26:22] religious until we
[26:24] become forget it all right
[26:29] but we seen that Eve was made perfect
[26:32] her body was made perfect not Eternal
[26:36] perfect her spirit was made perfect not
[26:40] Eternal I believe her soul was made as
[26:44] Eve perfect but not
[26:47] Eternal then God gave her through the
[26:50] nostrils eternal
[26:52] life as he did
[26:54] Adam cuz you can prove Adam was in
[26:57] blasphemia names all right now but in
[27:00] doing that then you
[27:03] see where that as we tried to cover it
[27:07] where brother brandham said that he took
[27:09] the spirit part of the feminist from
[27:13] Adam and put it into
[27:15] Eve all right then those things he began
[27:20] to talk about them as being the uh
[27:24] senses of the spirit
[27:26] Realm as I told you Satan was looking at
[27:29] her and trying to figure out some way to
[27:31] enter the human race but yet he couldn't
[27:34] do
[27:35] it he looked her over real good he
[27:37] couldn't figure out anything and all at
[27:39] once he began to see something not that
[27:41] God made her spirit wrong I emphasize
[27:43] that over and over Sunday God didn't
[27:46] make her spirit wrong he didn't make her
[27:48] body wrong he didn't make her soul wrong
[27:51] he made it perfect but as the point of
[27:54] where that you take from what was taken
[27:56] from Adam not his
[27:59] spirit because you'd leave him without a
[28:04] spirit but it was the feminist part that
[28:08] would make Eve to be what she would be
[28:11] and her desires and things would be to
[28:14] be a
[28:15] mother she would have those instincts
[28:17] dwelling within
[28:20] her and she'd already been told in
[28:23] spiritual Parts in Adams they were told
[28:26] to multiply replenish the Earth am she
[28:30] knew the story in a part but she didn't
[28:33] understand how it could be brought
[28:36] forth
[28:37] right and Satan he begins to reason get
[28:41] her to
[28:42] reason he begins to deal with her
[28:44] emotional
[28:46] side he begins to talk with
[28:49] her about these things not
[28:52] physically touching her in
[28:56] contact but to deal with her from the
[29:00] inside all right just like I told you
[29:02] Sunday girls you you know what I'm women
[29:05] you know what I'm talking
[29:07] about you first accept the man in the
[29:11] brain and I put it in there cuz I try my
[29:14] best to be so explicit or so blunt to
[29:17] where that somebody can't can't come
[29:19] along and say you did you said that I
[29:23] put it in there and I said I'm not
[29:24] talking about a rape case I'm not
[29:27] talking about a drug given to you and
[29:29] you go do something wrong I'm talking
[29:31] about normal Humanity or normal doings
[29:35] all right cuz I know I'm
[29:38] blunt you know what a a girl that is
[29:44] raped I'll be glad to talk with you out
[29:46] of a
[29:48] service if it's forceful thing she's
[29:50] still a
[29:52] virgin I don't care what you
[29:54] say because I can tie that with every
[29:57] scripture in the
[30:01] Bible no no well then what are you going
[30:04] to
[30:08] say what are you
[30:12] listening so Satan he saw his point that
[30:16] if he could get her to reason if he
[30:18] could get her to working in that
[30:20] emotional side that it would bring into
[30:22] being the motherly Instinct and things
[30:26] that she was made with the spirit coming
[30:28] from Adam as to that that she would have
[30:31] the feminist Spirit about it and that
[30:34] would be what it would be
[30:36] far was to be a
[30:38] mother all right and as it happened then
[30:42] Satan he just slowly gradually talked
[30:46] with
[30:48] her until he got the
[30:51] attention
[30:55] H then we know that he couldn't deal
[30:58] with the body to do anything he couldn't
[31:00] deal with the soul because she had
[31:01] eternal life in her
[31:07] soul so it was dealing in her spirit
[31:11] realm her memory or reasoning we will
[31:14] read a little bit in a minute of what
[31:16] the prophet had to say about Eve and
[31:18] what took
[31:20] place but I want you to think with
[31:23] me about
[31:26] it see we read that L Satan through his
[31:32] subtility his very smartness his very
[31:36] shrewd ability that he had that we would
[31:40] not fall as the scripture
[31:44] says so your mind should be corrupted
[31:47] from the
[31:49] Simplicity that is in
[31:56] Christ that we be not deceived but I I
[31:59] can't be deceived brother brother I
[32:01] can't be
[32:04] deceived well that's up to you and
[32:12] God but if you turn the word down you're
[32:15] already received that's that's no
[32:17] problem I turn it down that's my doings
[32:21] right all right so then Eve coming from
[32:26] Adam
[32:28] was part of the original
[32:31] creation sure not made as the animals
[32:35] were
[32:37] made you know male and female but made
[32:40] in
[32:42] Adam brother brand said he thought so
[32:45] much of her until he would not go to the
[32:49] dirt to get another clot of dirt to make
[32:52] a body he said the same way with Christ
[32:56] and his church now do we believe
[33:02] that
[33:04] right see then Eve
[33:08] as being in Adam coming from the body of
[33:13] Adam see the spirit coming from God the
[33:16] soul being her person or being or who
[33:18] she is the soul is the real you it's
[33:21] what you
[33:25] are then in doing
[33:30] that let's don't be
[33:35] deceived
[33:37] today I I thought Paul was talking to
[33:39] you and me right right I didn't know he
[33:43] was just talking about Adam and Eve you
[33:46] know I thought he was talking to the
[33:48] church amen
[33:51] amen all right and if he's talking to
[33:53] the church he's talking to ones that are
[33:55] in Christ amen cuz it's the only way you
[33:58] can be in the church is being in
[34:01] Christ he's talking to Born Again
[34:04] Believers sure I know the Corinthian
[34:06] story right they had a lot of problems
[34:09] but you know they did have a lot of
[34:11] truth
[34:13] right they just needed some help that's
[34:17] maybe us Lites need a little help that's
[34:20] right
[34:23] right let's just don't be
[34:25] deceived
[34:27] and being deceived you know what being
[34:29] deceived
[34:31] is you know what it is if a person's
[34:34] deceived they believe they are
[34:39] right or why else would you talk about
[34:41] being
[34:46] deceived they believe they are
[34:50] right
[34:55] right now
[34:59] let's take a little illustration and
[35:02] walk through
[35:03] it for a little
[35:06] bit and let's just see if we're
[35:09] deceived
[35:11] okay us lulaes now not what's on the
[35:14] internet listen that's your
[35:17] business I'm not throwing off on you I'm
[35:19] just saying I'm not your pastor out
[35:22] there I'm the pastor of this church what
[35:23] you listen to me is up to you what you
[35:26] talk about is up to you not up to me
[35:30] don't call me I've had I've turned down
[35:32] people that would call me and say
[35:34] brother Dale I want to know about this I
[35:36] said go to your
[35:38] pastor or go to the prophet's message
[35:41] and I've had them to say this I'd say
[35:43] brother Dale I am a
[35:47] pastor and I've refused to answer their
[35:50] question because that would become me
[35:54] trying to Pastor them I say go to the
[35:57] prophet's
[36:00] message and I said all right now if you
[36:03] are in confidence enough to call me to
[36:05] want to know
[36:07] something then if you will go back a few
[36:10] services to a message call so so and so
[36:13] and so on a date you might find your
[36:18] answer I have done
[36:22] that because that's left up to
[36:25] them that's tried to explain this one
[36:28] time on this situation here we're going
[36:29] to get into to about 25
[36:34] ministers and some of them begin to
[36:37] realize that they had been
[36:44] deceived remember we're trying to find
[36:47] out what happened to
[36:51] Eve and in doing that is to help us to
[36:54] find out what's happening to us
[37:02] cuz now whether you agree or what you're
[37:03] doing it's up to you see where you're
[37:04] going to put yourself you got to make a
[37:06] decision I know that I require that for
[37:08] you to make a decision I'm
[37:10] sorry not sorry for doing
[37:13] it but I'm sorry that it has to be done
[37:16] that you must make a
[37:18] decision you've got to either decide
[37:20] what I'm saying is right or decide what
[37:22] I'm saying is
[37:24] wrong okay and if you decide it's right
[37:28] then all right and I don't mean I'm ever
[37:30] word right you know now don't we garbage
[37:32] canand with me and I won't be with you
[37:35] I've still got a lot of questions about
[37:36] this message that I don't have the right
[37:38] answer for amen Aaron Roberts back there
[37:41] called me first time he talked to me on
[37:43] the phone he asked me a question I FLT
[37:45] told him I don't know the answer he
[37:47] started laughing and he said I called a
[37:49] man that everybody said had the
[37:50] answerers and he told me that he didn't
[37:52] even know I saidwell why me tell you
[37:54] something that I don't know
[37:58] right all
[38:01] right cuz you see if we find out what
[38:04] happened to Eve we can find out what's
[38:06] happening to you and I now we ain't got
[38:08] to the death yet we're still in the
[38:11] stages coming up the next message the
[38:13] Lord willing will be about how
[38:17] that death comes
[38:21] involved but it's getting you to what's
[38:23] going
[38:25] on all right
[38:29] right in said if we find out what went
[38:31] wrong with Eve we can find out what's
[38:34] going wrong now you say what do you mean
[38:37] by that well we've been around here
[38:40] quite a while amen I think we walked
[38:43] around horb long enough don't you you
[38:47] remember they had about 40 years around
[38:50] horb
[38:52] right amen you take that and lay it down
[38:54] on the mount one time I guess the tick
[38:56] when I think of mankind you lay down on
[38:58] a map the the horb and the position of
[39:01] Israel and they walked 40
[39:04] years look like somebody would have
[39:07] said we was here last week cuz there's
[39:10] that same rock that I put my ex
[39:13] on surely they had to cross their own
[39:16] tracks many many
[39:18] times walking 40 years even they didn't
[39:21] go with a mile a
[39:22] day that would have been 365 miles and
[39:26] you know that's a lot of
[39:28] mileage all
[39:30] right but now consider
[39:37] it I believe this is to me is one very
[39:41] very important
[39:43] matter that will help us to understand
[39:46] what happened to
[39:48] Eve is what's happening to us cuz now I
[39:53] keep saying it because I I just let
[39:55] there's no quotes from brother brandom
[39:57] says about Eve receiving eternal
[40:00] life not that I found maybe you have but
[40:02] I
[40:03] don't I've come to that conclusion so
[40:06] that's what you say that's what brother
[40:08] Dale has to say about well you tell me
[40:10] what you got to say about it because if
[40:12] Eve didn't have eternal
[40:18] life you can't compare with
[40:22] her right and you can't say God started
[40:26] his church that way and wants to end it
[40:29] that way you're going to change
[40:32] somewhere in the
[40:34] line so I believe Eve had eternal life
[40:37] in her soul I don't ask you to agree
[40:40] with that I just ask you to listen so if
[40:43] she had eternal life in her soul and her
[40:46] body and spirit was not Eternal how many
[40:48] of you claim to have eternal life
[40:50] tonight right amen well your body and
[40:53] your spirit is maybe I said it wrong did
[40:56] I say it right I said the body spirit
[40:59] and soul get it right way it's supposed
[41:00] to
[41:01] be Eve had not eternal life in her body
[41:06] not eternal life in her spirit she had
[41:08] eternal life in her
[41:10] soul by that part of the theophany that
[41:13] was placed within Eve right all
[41:16] right that's exactly where you and I are
[41:18] sitting tonight by the new birth we have
[41:21] eternal life in our soul our body and
[41:23] our spirit is not
[41:25] eternal
[41:28] now do you see the the conclusion of the
[41:31] matter what else can it
[41:33] be we can look at Eve and find out what
[41:36] went
[41:37] wrong and by seeing what she done
[41:41] wrong we can turn against
[41:43] that and try to do what's
[41:49] right now if You' have asked Eve about
[41:51] the time she'd begin there a few days
[41:53] talking and walking around if you'd have
[41:55] said Eve or you deceived no I
[41:58] straightened that old booger out I told
[42:01] him that we couldn't eat a ever tree
[42:04] there was one out there
[42:07] right that we couldn't eat of good woman
[42:11] preacher all
[42:14] right but now here's something
[42:19] that I began to study the
[42:22] message and even back when we didn't
[42:24] have computers to run things we wrote
[42:26] Our Own concordances and done everything
[42:29] we could to try to find you know the
[42:32] connections and put it together what the
[42:34] prophet had said in many different
[42:37] places and that's why if you see my
[42:38] Bible it's got a lot of writing on it
[42:41] you see any of the books that I have
[42:42] they have a lot of writing which is
[42:44] references in one to the other backwards
[42:46] and forth and you know that's a real
[42:49] good thing to
[42:51] do but I realized one day that there was
[42:53] something
[42:55] wrong
[42:59] because I believed Eve had eternal life
[43:01] in her
[43:04] soul and brother brandham would
[43:08] say paraphrasing close
[43:11] enough that Eve sinned in her
[43:25] soul
[43:27] if she's got eternal life how could she
[43:28] do
[43:31] it then we'll get into another point in
[43:34] a minute where brother brandham
[43:38] says do we sin he said every
[43:43] day but then there's another quote right
[43:46] there close to it he
[43:47] says do Christian sin he says no it is
[43:55] impossible
[44:03] now what you going to do you got two
[44:04] sides what are you going to do we're
[44:06] going to flip a coin to see which one's
[44:07] right or we're going to do it by the
[44:09] weight of your matter of how many quotes
[44:10] we got or are we going to try some way
[44:13] to let God reveal that to us to where
[44:18] that it would take
[44:20] away the unbelief
[44:23] amen well it don't matter me
[44:30] whether I guess it don't matter to you
[44:32] where acts 238 Compares with Matthew
[44:38] 28:19
[44:41] what well it don't matter to me I don't
[44:43] need to well you don't need to
[44:44] understand Matthew 28:19 next
[44:48] 238 you don't need to understand whether
[44:50] it's an eternal hell or not an eternal
[44:54] hell
[44:57] maybe we don't need anything we just
[44:58] need to eat drink and be
[45:01] married remember we've been 40 something
[45:04] years walking around
[45:07] horb
[45:12] right amen but brother brandham in his
[45:15] early Ministry now I've preached this
[45:17] many many many
[45:18] times here over the 40 something 50
[45:21] years I've been preaching cuz when I saw
[45:24] that that opened a channel to to me that
[45:28] took
[45:28] away all of the doubts and the
[45:31] frustrations of why would this quote be
[45:34] here and this quote be
[45:36] here I I love to see it come together
[45:39] that you don't have to deny neither one
[45:41] of them
[45:43] amen
[45:46] right where he said today was listening
[45:48] to in the truck going down the road
[45:51] where he said I like to take the
[45:54] scriptures and let them come
[45:58] together and make a beautiful
[46:01] picture all
[46:06] right see
[46:08] then as the prophet begins to
[46:12] explain and all the way through his
[46:15] entire Ministry he spoke of a trown
[46:22] being
[46:24] right yeah always spoke of a triun being
[46:27] that is what we were and he said God's a
[46:29] trione being he said he's Father Son and
[46:31] Holy Ghost he said now not a
[46:33] trinity he said and you're not three
[46:36] people he said but you're a tri
[46:41] being and in his early Ministry he'll
[46:44] say that you are
[46:45] Body Soul
[46:51] Spirit but then when he comes on up into
[46:54] the seals and they begin to break to him
[46:56] you can watch him on if you'll really
[46:58] study it you can watch him on greatest
[47:00] battle ever fought and he's
[47:03] he's look like he's
[47:05] moving I studied that message till I
[47:09] could just see him he would he would be
[47:11] like trying to line up something and he
[47:14] was fighting a great battle
[47:16] himself and somewhere along after the
[47:19] opening of the seals he began to preach
[47:22] that it was Body Spirit and
[47:27] soul of the tri being where in his early
[47:31] Ministry he would been preaching on a
[47:33] basis of Body Soul and
[47:39] Spirit all right do you do you need
[47:43] those
[47:49] quotes go ahead with number one then
[47:52] Brothers
[47:53] we'll I'll just read them to you then
[47:55] that way you can't say that it ain't
[47:57] something but watch what he says here in
[48:00] and North it not
[48:02] 1965 he draw a little circle and things
[48:05] and draws the Rings and so forth I'm
[48:07] going to make one ring like this and I'm
[48:09] going to make another ring on the inside
[48:11] of that ring that's two then I'm going
[48:13] to make a ring on the inside of that
[48:15] ring there's three rings three circles
[48:18] now that's you that's God God in a
[48:23] Trinity is
[48:24] One and without a trinity he's not
[48:33] God don't blow your brains
[48:37] out without a triun he's never believed
[48:41] in Trinity
[48:44] right that's God God and a trinity is
[48:46] one and without a trinity he's not God
[48:49] he can't be manifest any other way now
[48:52] he's a triun being not not a trinity of
[49:00] beings right he's a tri
[49:03] being and without a tri own being he
[49:06] can't be cuz remember I spent so much
[49:08] time explaining what if you say that
[49:10] it's Father Son and Holy Ghost three
[49:12] persons you're over here on a Trinity
[49:15] right where did the Oneness go they went
[49:18] over here to one like you finger and one
[49:20] Manifest this that and the
[49:24] other without having the Triune
[49:27] being he cannot be God you're going to
[49:31] be a trinity or Oneness one but yeah we
[49:34] can get all tied up in little
[49:37] wordings now watch neither can you be
[49:40] manifest without being the Trinity
[49:42] person that you are that's Body Spirit
[49:45] Soul without either one of them you're
[49:48] not
[49:49] complete see you didn't have a soul
[49:52] you'd be nothing didn't have a spirit
[49:54] you wouldn't be nothing you didn't have
[49:56] a body you'd just be a spirit not a body
[49:59] so it
[50:01] takes the body the spirit and the soul
[50:05] to make an
[50:07] individual all right
[50:13] now
[50:17] then he used
[50:20] this all the way through the message to
[50:24] explain
[50:27] that the being of a person and what we
[50:31] are in comparison to God and what he
[50:38] is but even though and I'll restate this
[50:41] over and over even though he changes the
[50:44] wording from Soul to
[50:47] Spirit he never changes the senses of
[50:51] that
[50:54] position
[50:56] so the senses of the
[50:59] position gives you the right answer
[51:02] there's five senses to the outside man
[51:04] which is cast field smelling
[51:07] here the second real of
[51:11] man no matter what he called
[51:15] it the five senses of memory reason
[51:18] imagination conscience love and
[51:21] different whatever the five
[51:24] senses now when you read the
[51:27] message and you think there's something
[51:31] wrong that he send in her
[51:36] soul go back and check the
[51:40] senses she sending her memory reason
[51:44] conscience
[51:46] affection the second real so no matter
[51:50] you say well well he needed to correct
[51:52] that and I am certainly quick enough to
[51:56] say I am not smart enough to correct him
[52:00] and you ain't either so we don't worry
[52:02] about that all
[52:05] right because this is not a
[52:09] correction it's a statement he didn't
[52:11] have to explain that over
[52:14] again because he always gave the senses
[52:17] the
[52:18] same the outside Rim five second Rim
[52:22] memory reason conscious the third rim
[52:25] him was always one sense either Faith or
[52:30] doubt right so he didn't have to explain
[52:34] it you know why you know this is Brother
[52:36] Dale okay you know why that was
[52:42] done it was done where people could
[52:44] argue about
[52:47] it what does it
[52:51] say that you
[52:54] baptized
[52:56] name of the father and of the son and of
[52:58] the Holy
[53:01] Ghost but then 10 days later he would
[53:05] say in the name of Jesus
[53:07] Christ that's right now that has
[53:10] deceived the world right that's right
[53:12] you
[53:14] agree that has mixed the world up amen
[53:19] amen that's why when you hear me baptize
[53:21] somebody cuz I heard the prophet say it
[53:23] one day
[53:25] I say to fulfill the Great Commission of
[53:28] Matthew
[53:29] 28:19 to baptize in the name of the
[53:32] father and of the son and of the Holy
[53:34] Ghost I now baptize thee my brother
[53:36] sister what in the name of the Lord
[53:38] Jesus
[53:39] Christ you know both of them are saying
[53:42] the same
[53:43] thing right
[53:49] right now you tell me they're not saying
[53:51] the same
[53:54] thing
[53:55] father son Holy Ghost Lord Jesus
[54:00] Christ
[54:02] right now here I leave this one for you
[54:06] to
[54:11] explain all
[54:15] right would you accept somebody in the
[54:18] church if they came in here and they
[54:19] saidwell brother I want you to know I
[54:22] was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[54:26] NOP NOP got to be Lord Jesus Christ you
[54:29] ain't got no scripture right that's
[54:33] right brother you ain't got no
[54:36] scripture because it said in the name of
[54:39] Jesus Christ read your
[54:42] Bible brother brandham put the Lord onto
[54:45] it to show in Father Son and Holy Ghost
[54:48] Lord Jesus
[54:52] Christ would you hear him even say said
[54:55] we baptize them people in Christian
[54:57] baptism in the name of Jesus
[55:02] Christ I had some of these people that
[55:05] were here some of you
[55:07] came may not be here now
[55:11] but and they said they was baptized in
[55:13] the name of Jesus Christ I said the only
[55:16] one question I ask you I said I accept
[55:19] Jesus Christ because that is
[55:22] Bible but the question I ask you when
[55:25] you was baptized in the name of Jesus
[55:27] Christ was you baptized under
[55:30] regeneration and they said yes cuz see I
[55:34] know they do that they baptize in the
[55:35] name of Jesus Christ under regeneration
[55:37] they baptize in the name of the Lord
[55:39] Jesus Christ under regeneration that's
[55:41] right said you think I need to be
[55:43] baptized again I said I ain't going to
[55:44] tell you what to do but I'm certainly
[55:46] going to tell you in a hurry I would do
[55:49] it well everyone I talked to I baptized
[55:52] them again even though they'v been
[55:53] baptized before because it was what it
[55:55] was the problem under regeneration we
[55:57] don't believe in baptism under
[56:00] regeneration that's
[56:03] right so there's a lot of things that
[56:06] maybe God said through His prophets and
[56:11] his writers that would
[56:13] leave mankind away to
[56:17] argue and that would be what Paul was
[56:20] talking about through the
[56:23] Simplicity that is in Christ
[56:27] Jesus what is the Simplicity is in
[56:29] Christ Jesus father Son and Holy Ghost
[56:32] Lord Jesus Christ that's
[56:35] simple
[56:38] okay so now what we're talking about
[56:40] using those as
[56:43] example that the prophet in his earlier
[56:46] Ministries up until somewhere in the mid
[56:50] 60s he would basically talk
[56:53] about body Body
[56:56] Soul and
[57:00] Spirit then in his later Ministry he
[57:09] stated what
[57:12] body spirit and
[57:16] soul that don't have to be
[57:21] corrected it has to be understood
[57:25] amen
[57:27] right let's read a
[57:35] couple to make sure that you don't
[57:37] misunderstand me to think that I I don't
[57:41] bring it to you go ahead with number two
[57:43] which is taken P perseverance
[57:45] 1962 uh 218 paragraph
[57:48] 23 through
[57:52] 25 he's talking about faith and things
[57:54] things and he said we have our
[57:56] body and our being here is like a seed
[58:00] and a seed on the outside has a shell
[58:02] inside the shell has a crust or a pup
[58:05] pardon me and inside the pup has a germ
[58:08] that's the way we are Body Soul Spirit
[58:14] now to the body there's five senses c t
[58:16] feel smelling here to the soul there's
[58:18] conscience and so forth five Avenues to
[58:22] it okay the inside is one one Avenue and
[58:27] that Avenue is the same place as that
[58:29] before every man from Adam down to where
[58:31] where we are of self will all right so
[58:34] in 62 what's he saying he's saying Body
[58:37] Soul Spirit okay going up the greatest
[58:39] battle ever fought pick up the next one
[58:43] paragraph
[58:46] 72 uh let's see that's still part
[58:49] of that's part of the other that's where
[58:52] he's telling about the two masters spir
[58:54] go ahead to number number
[58:58] three the greatest battle ever fought he
[59:01] said you'll find out that the outside
[59:02] body has five senses it's contacted by
[59:04] and that is SE taste feel smell and here
[59:06] that's the five senses that control the
[59:08] human body inside of the body is a soul
[59:11] and that soul is controlled by
[59:13] imagination conscious memory reason and
[59:15] affection that's the thing that controls
[59:17] the soul but the spirit is is only has
[59:22] one sense the spirit it either dominates
[59:25] it which is Faith or doubt all right do
[59:28] you see what the prophet is
[59:33] doing but remember what he did
[59:38] do five senses to the
[59:41] body five senses to the second realm to
[59:44] here he calls the soul one sense to what
[59:48] he calls a spirit it only has
[59:50] one all
[59:52] right now let's read number four which
[59:55] is taken from works as Faith
[59:58] Express
[1:00:01] 1965 now remember you're in a cycle of
[1:00:04] three but you're one
[1:00:06] person like Father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:00:08] cycle of three but one person three
[1:00:11] attributes of the same God fatherhood
[1:00:13] three offices like fatherhood sunship
[1:00:14] and Holy Ghost and you are Body Spirit
[1:00:17] and soul now the outside body has five
[1:00:20] inlets to it to contact your Earthly
[1:00:22] home see taste feel smell and hear and
[1:00:25] the inside which is a spirit it has five
[1:00:28] senses conscience and love and so forth
[1:00:30] but the inside of that the soul as one
[1:00:33] thing that's where you
[1:00:35] live see as I say a while ago I believe
[1:00:38] God allows these things to happen to let
[1:00:42] people deceive their own
[1:00:48] selves if you ever talk to a person that
[1:00:52] believes in Two Souls you you will find
[1:00:55] out in a hurry it is very valuable to
[1:00:58] know the difference between Soul and
[1:01:03] Spirit you remember the Bible plainly
[1:01:06] tells you that Hebrews 4
[1:01:10] and12 that the word of
[1:01:13] God and who's the word come
[1:01:16] to the prophet the word of God discerns
[1:01:21] between Soul and Spirit that's right
[1:01:28] you know that Paul gets over there and
[1:01:29] explaining I'll get to it in a minute
[1:01:31] where he's talking
[1:01:34] about
[1:01:36] uh and names it but he doesn't name it
[1:01:39] in an order form he names It soul body
[1:01:43] and spirit showing that Paul knew of the
[1:01:47] trone part of man but in that quote he
[1:01:50] doesn't say Body Spirit and soul he
[1:01:52] doesn't say Body Soul spirit he says
[1:01:55] Body Soul you know it says says soul
[1:01:58] body Spirit I'm 99% sure I'll find that
[1:02:02] in the minute cuz I got in my notes all
[1:02:04] right but you see what he's talking
[1:02:08] about but you jump back to find out
[1:02:11] where Eve went wrong go ahead with
[1:02:13] number five this is taken from the
[1:02:15] greatest battle ever
[1:02:21] fought Eve could not sin until she laid
[1:02:24] aside God's word opening up her channel
[1:02:28] of reasoning through her soul and begin
[1:02:32] to
[1:02:36] reason now come on he's done told you
[1:02:38] the cerm can't reason is Faith or
[1:02:44] doubt you see now which one of these do
[1:02:46] you
[1:02:49] want I take them all because it gives me
[1:02:52] a great understanding all right well
[1:02:55] certainly my husband has never told me
[1:02:57] these things but I believe that you he
[1:03:01] told me I shouldn't do this but you know
[1:03:04] you made it so real now
[1:03:06] what you may argue with me that Adam and
[1:03:09] Eve talked why certainly my husband has
[1:03:12] never told me these things but I believe
[1:03:15] that you he told me I shouldn't do this
[1:03:20] sure
[1:03:22] amen but you know you make it so real
[1:03:25] and plain I I I believe it would be
[1:03:28] wonderful because you're making it so
[1:03:30] plain to me see there was the first
[1:03:32] battle and through that battle has
[1:03:34] caused every other war and every
[1:03:36] Bloodshed that ever be what did she do
[1:03:38] she disbelieved God's word
[1:03:40] amen
[1:03:44] right Eve began to stop number
[1:03:49] six I just want to make sure I've just
[1:03:51] given you these most of you know them
[1:03:54] but but giving them to you where
[1:03:55] somebody else out there listening they
[1:03:57] wonder what we believe at Lula we
[1:03:59] believe what the prophet says but bring
[1:04:01] it together Eve began to stop to
[1:04:05] reason when he she quoted the word to
[1:04:08] him God said you should not eat thereof
[1:04:10] for the day you eat thereof that day you
[1:04:12] die and Satan never disagreed with her
[1:04:14] he said certainly that's right but he
[1:04:16] said you see you you need new light
[1:04:19] something a little different from what
[1:04:20] God Said and if you do do it you'll be
[1:04:23] just just a little smarter your eyes
[1:04:26] will be open right on the tug of war
[1:04:29] pull the whole human race into death
[1:04:31] because Eve listened to a reasoning
[1:04:33] against God's
[1:04:37] word that's a shame that she did but
[1:04:40] it's
[1:04:43] done are you following me
[1:04:48] now said pull the whole human race did
[1:04:51] Eve listening to reason let's see if he
[1:04:55] still had that same thought in
[1:04:56] 1965 go to number seven now I got to
[1:05:00] check this cuz we got a 7 a okay leave
[1:05:03] it that
[1:05:04] way Satan's Eden 65 notice she pulled
[1:05:08] off the holy Veil to see what sex really
[1:05:10] was compare
[1:05:13] that what lust really would do she
[1:05:16] pulled a veil from off her eyes the holy
[1:05:18] thing that God had put over her eyes she
[1:05:21] wanted knowledge to know what it was all
[1:05:24] about so she pulled a veil off to see
[1:05:26] what it was all about she listened to
[1:05:28] the devil and noticed what a place it
[1:05:30] put her
[1:05:31] in wanted
[1:05:33] knowledge knowledge is one of your B
[1:05:36] thoughts of the
[1:05:38] spirit you know memory reason conscience
[1:05:41] affections and things your knowledge
[1:05:44] comes through your spirit part of
[1:05:46] you right so it looks like he had the
[1:05:50] same thought in
[1:05:53] 65 but what about it what do you
[1:05:59] see well I don't think it's important
[1:06:01] well it's not important to get baptized
[1:06:03] correctly so we just go and do what I
[1:06:05] want to I'm
[1:06:08] sorry sorry for
[1:06:11] being a smart at
[1:06:14] it but if I save your soul and I die and
[1:06:18] go to
[1:06:19] hell I hope I get a drop of
[1:06:23] water because I'm trying my best to save
[1:06:26] your
[1:06:27] soul not your body and not your
[1:06:32] spirit all
[1:06:35] right now as I said when we
[1:06:40] started give me a quick
[1:06:44] minute Christians sin but a sinner
[1:06:47] cannot
[1:06:48] sin because he's a sinner that's taken
[1:06:51] from adoption in 19
[1:06:54] 60 but look at him number eight yeah
[1:06:58] that would be the seven look at number
[1:07:01] eight questions and answers in 59 do
[1:07:03] Christians sin absolutely
[1:07:07] no there is no scripture where a
[1:07:10] Christian
[1:07:12] sins he cannot sin I know there's a
[1:07:16] resentment to
[1:07:18] that
[1:07:20] well we'll just go to First John 3 and
[1:07:26] see what the scripture says a Christian
[1:07:28] does not sin now where'd he go
[1:07:32] to did he go to the scripture where it
[1:07:35] talks about it's impossible for a man to
[1:07:37] sin because a seed remaineth in him and
[1:07:39] he cannot
[1:07:42] sin see the seed remaineth in you and
[1:07:44] you cannot sin the seed can't
[1:07:47] sin that's
[1:07:49] right okay brother R's right in both
[1:07:52] statements sir he's exactly right in
[1:07:55] both
[1:07:56] statements he's explaining that do we
[1:07:58] sin and let's go on down to the next one
[1:08:00] while we're on it and you can run it up
[1:08:02] you can to to number nine says you get
[1:08:05] that this morning how that we're perfect
[1:08:06] perfected absolutely spotless and
[1:08:08] blameless no one sin on us
[1:08:12] listen are you above Temptation never do
[1:08:16] you sin every day yes
[1:08:20] sir but yet we are perfected because we
[1:08:23] are in him and God couldn't judge us no
[1:08:26] more than he can judge
[1:08:27] him
[1:08:29] now is the Bible right and the prophet
[1:08:36] right what about
[1:08:43] it so Eve couldn't Sin from her soul
[1:08:47] right she sinned in her spirit
[1:08:50] realm now here's where you ain't going
[1:08:53] to like so go
[1:08:55] ahead lock it
[1:08:57] down a true born again
[1:09:01] Christian sins in their spirit and not
[1:09:05] in their soul because they cannot sin in
[1:09:08] their soul because the seed remaineth in
[1:09:10] them and they cannot sin that's right
[1:09:12] that ought to be straight
[1:09:14] amen well brother Dale do you do wrong
[1:09:17] every day brother brandom do you sin
[1:09:20] every
[1:09:21] day well he he he didn't really mean
[1:09:24] that he done that to deceive you well he
[1:09:26] done a good job deceiving me because
[1:09:27] that fits the rest of the
[1:09:30] Bible that fits Paul the things I would
[1:09:32] not I do the things I do not I
[1:09:34] would that really fits a whole lot of
[1:09:38] things and then it fits some quotes
[1:09:40] brother brandham gave of how
[1:09:44] that in the Bible says Jesus was tempted
[1:09:48] in all points as we are yet without
[1:09:52] sin brother rown said he was even
[1:09:55] tempted of
[1:09:57] women but he didn't
[1:10:01] sin it's not wrong to be tempted it's
[1:10:04] wrong when you yield to the
[1:10:10] Temptation you can't go nowhere in the
[1:10:12] world today
[1:10:14] without naked women in front of you
[1:10:18] right you go to drive by these churches
[1:10:20] and look what's going to
[1:10:22] them wouldn't it be
[1:10:25] nice one time brother brandham there was
[1:10:28] a lady came in I'm paraphrasing it so
[1:10:30] but it's pretty close the lady was
[1:10:33] didn't have on too good of a and you
[1:10:37] know what he
[1:10:39] done he took his coat off and spread it
[1:10:42] over her
[1:10:45] legs well he said one time he said I've
[1:10:50] got a couple of good
[1:10:52] suits you know well let's say he had two
[1:10:55] good suits and four bad ones okay that's
[1:10:57] six suits he's run out in a little while
[1:11:00] today that's true right spreading over
[1:11:04] the
[1:11:07] legs oh you know what that gets a point
[1:11:11] across whether you th KN it or not it
[1:11:13] sinks in that's why I do that a
[1:11:17] lot but do you what do you
[1:11:22] think a true Christian can't Sin from
[1:11:25] his soul
[1:11:26] right no way if you're born
[1:11:32] again so you got to take it to another
[1:11:34] realm and you got to realize then that
[1:11:36] the body without the spirit is dead so
[1:11:38] then you can't say the body is what done
[1:11:40] it I just can't help it this old body
[1:11:42] lust the body don't lust that's right
[1:11:45] that's
[1:11:46] right that's right come on it's the
[1:11:50] inward part of the spirit part of us
[1:11:52] that Satan is still working on just like
[1:11:54] he did Eve amen that's right cuz you
[1:11:58] can't lust with your body without
[1:12:00] something motivating
[1:12:01] it amen
[1:12:05] right so then the center real of mankind
[1:12:08] I mean the second realm of mankind
[1:12:11] whether you want to call it Soul or
[1:12:14] whether you want to call it Spirit just
[1:12:16] make sure you got your five senses of
[1:12:18] memory reason conscience affections tied
[1:12:20] up in there and you find out what Eve
[1:12:22] done in the garden
[1:12:25] she listened to the devil's lie contrary
[1:12:30] to the word of
[1:12:38] God how many times have I made this
[1:12:42] statement I'm not going to tell you you
[1:12:44] can't turn on a tape recorder or
[1:12:46] computer or whatever and listen to
[1:12:49] somebody else's
[1:12:51] Services because that is your choice
[1:12:54] your free moral
[1:12:56] agent what have I told you on that
[1:13:01] though I said you listen to what you
[1:13:04] want to because that's your
[1:13:07] business but when you bring it back in
[1:13:09] this congregation what you've heard
[1:13:12] brother so and so say that is contrary
[1:13:15] to brother Dale brother Dale is going to
[1:13:18] speak
[1:13:20] out and if any of you go among which I
[1:13:23] know you do so then I'm exposing that
[1:13:27] and you talk your little petty feelings
[1:13:29] and I'm going to preach what I
[1:13:36] believe is that the way we talk a lot of
[1:13:39] time I'm going to believe it this
[1:13:42] way well go ahead and believe it but
[1:13:46] just remember when you tell somebody
[1:13:49] else
[1:13:52] that
[1:13:55] death is on your shoulders
[1:14:00] that's amen yes sir I never had any
[1:14:04] trouble with anybody here I've even told
[1:14:05] the preachers I said just don't come to
[1:14:07] this pull pit and preach contrary to me
[1:14:10] until you sit in my office and explain
[1:14:12] why that's right then when you explain
[1:14:14] in my office what's wrong I'll give you
[1:14:17] the pull pit to explain what you
[1:14:21] believe but no you can't keep preachers
[1:14:23] from doing
[1:14:25] that they're going to put it out they're
[1:14:27] going to tell you what they
[1:14:29] believe because they're
[1:14:33] anointed your anointing can't be
[1:14:36] different from the word may I quote
[1:14:38] brother Brandon was listening to him
[1:14:40] today and he say but but we're anointed
[1:14:44] he said what does the word
[1:14:48] say he said then your anointing
[1:14:50] paraphrasing it your anointing doesn't
[1:14:52] have anything to do with it
[1:14:56] and like I've always said you go tell
[1:14:58] somebody I'm
[1:15:00] wrong do you
[1:15:03] realize until you come to me
[1:15:07] first you wrong and we'll answer to God
[1:15:12] that's right that's your
[1:15:15] choice you go tell somebody you at least
[1:15:17] come tell me I'm
[1:15:22] wrong I ain't whooped anybody yet
[1:15:24] because they differed with
[1:15:29] me why can't we sit down and
[1:15:36] talk you see what Satan has
[1:15:39] done through his
[1:15:42] subtility he deceived
[1:15:46] Eve through working upon her emotional
[1:15:51] side through memory reason conscience
[1:15:54] affections
[1:15:57] Etc that's right and he caused all of
[1:16:00] this death next we will cover death and
[1:16:02] what it is because death is when we turn
[1:16:05] the word
[1:16:08] down the Bible says about Cain that
[1:16:14] what he went out from the presence of
[1:16:17] the
[1:16:22] Lord that's when he
[1:16:25] died because there was no
[1:16:28] hopes he would not
[1:16:32] listen what about you and
[1:16:36] I I believe a Christian can do
[1:16:47] wrong but as quick as he finds out he's
[1:16:49] wrong he's going to straighten it
[1:16:51] up right
[1:16:53] amen if not may I quote the
[1:16:58] prophet about the Ramsay that his name
[1:17:02] the Hebrew Book or Smith Smith R it's in
[1:17:05] the Hebrew Book where the man wanted
[1:17:08] somebody to preacher wanted somebody to
[1:17:09] go get him some beer and bring it and he
[1:17:12] refused to do
[1:17:14] it he went out and got his
[1:17:18] own Ramsey
[1:17:21] again so many days later which was 10
[1:17:24] days 2 weeks or something very short
[1:17:26] time the man was
[1:17:30] dead now you can argue over whether or
[1:17:33] not he was born again I'll just quote
[1:17:37] the rest of the prophet he said God
[1:17:40] could not let his child Mar his name so
[1:17:45] he took him
[1:17:47] home now you can argue whether he was a
[1:17:49] born again Christian or where he was
[1:17:51] adopted manifested son or whether he was
[1:17:53] lost or
[1:17:56] whatever he said he took his child
[1:18:01] home premature death that's it
[1:18:08] why Paul says to turn people over to the
[1:18:11] destruction of the flesh that what that
[1:18:14] the
[1:18:15] soul may be saved as of by
[1:18:20] fire right right
[1:18:23] amen all
[1:18:26] right I believe a true born again
[1:18:29] Christian as the prophet said I sin
[1:18:32] every
[1:18:33] day that's what he said about
[1:18:38] himself you say yeah but that's
[1:18:41] unbelief now the next message will be
[1:18:44] the clarification of
[1:18:47] unbelief CU I don't have time
[1:18:51] 15:09 I I will state
[1:18:55] it on this
[1:18:57] way there has to be an
[1:19:01] unbelief according to the
[1:19:05] Bible that is unbelief but not under
[1:19:11] death the Bible says
[1:19:15] it says there's a sin not unto
[1:19:19] death but there's a sin unto death and
[1:19:22] he said I don't I say you don't pray for
[1:19:24] that sin un death now I'm paraphrasing
[1:19:27] but it's close enough
[1:19:30] right see if you know somebody's wrong
[1:19:33] and you go try to help them and they
[1:19:34] won't straighten up you stop praying
[1:19:37] that's right that's
[1:19:39] right why because let God's hand take it
[1:19:43] if he's a child it'll straighten enough
[1:19:45] he's not it between him and God no
[1:19:49] brother Dale we need to pray for
[1:19:50] everybody I had that to house happen
[1:19:54] here and some of you would say well
[1:19:57] who's going to cast the first stone I'm
[1:19:59] the guy that's got to cast
[1:20:03] it I have no choice
[1:20:07] right because I've got to say what that
[1:20:10] says and I have no
[1:20:13] choice it's not that I want
[1:20:16] to do you think that Peter was sitting
[1:20:18] over there wouldn't it him when the man
[1:20:19] come up if you sold this for the
[1:20:21] property this he said yeah he said
[1:20:23] you've lied against the Holy Ghost don't
[1:20:24] you think Peter loved that
[1:20:26] man he didn't want him to
[1:20:32] Die the next we'll talk about
[1:20:37] death and how that the Bible says the
[1:20:40] woman that liveth in pleasure is dead
[1:20:43] while she liveth remember we are the
[1:20:47] woman
[1:20:49] right that's just not meaning the
[1:20:51] females in the crowd Crow us males can
[1:20:54] get by not
[1:20:57] exactly do you understand what I'm
[1:20:59] talking about a true Christian
[1:21:03] can from their Spirit real of memory
[1:21:06] reason conscious
[1:21:08] affections can actually do
[1:21:12] wrong but understand what I said they
[1:21:15] won't stay
[1:21:18] wrong quick as this brought to their
[1:21:20] attention they'll get straight
[1:21:25] because we're facing god let's stand
[1:21:27] come on
[1:21:32] Brothers evees
[1:21:38] unbelief but I don't have no
[1:21:40] unbelief what are you holling
[1:21:49] about you say but
[1:22:00] so there must be an
[1:22:03] unbelief that can even be in the
[1:22:05] Christian
[1:22:09] realm but not in their
[1:22:13] soul but now let's don't lay on that too
[1:22:17] heavy well I've got it straightened out
[1:22:21] now it ain't my body that's the
[1:22:27] problem I used to think I couldn't have
[1:22:30] it cause my body was made this way so
[1:22:34] now brother Dale's got that out of the
[1:22:36] way so now it's my spirit I just can't
[1:22:40] have it in my
[1:22:46] spirit maybe we just can't help it
[1:22:48] anyway go ahead brother uh 41 spiral
