[18:28] i stay in touch with with the brothers
[18:30] uh in nicaragua
[18:32] and honduras i s uh
[18:35] i still stay and and try to be in touch
[18:38] with what's going on over there and um
[18:40] but i wanted to talk about real quick
[18:42] just bring up this
[18:43] this need uh of for a family now some of
[18:47] some of the
[18:47] uh you brothers uh have already um
[18:50] helped out with this need but um
[18:54] there's a family last year that they had
[18:56] a they had a one-year-old
[18:58] son and uh all throughout last year's
[19:02] as as bad as it was you know and
[19:06] they were having to they were battling
[19:07] with the health of their little boy
[19:09] the little boy pretty much came to a
[19:11] point where he got real sick i cannot
[19:14] remember the
[19:15] the what exactly what he had anyways
[19:18] back in november
[19:19] december the little the little baby died
[19:21] the lord decided to take them
[19:23] and so the family is a family it was a
[19:26] family of four now it's a family of
[19:28] three
[19:29] this is their this was their little
[19:30] house that they lived in in nicaragua
[19:34] and uh far cry for some some of our
[19:38] houses that we
[19:39] that we stay at and then sometimes we
[19:40] complain
[19:43] but but you see while they were going
[19:46] back and forth
[19:47] uh to the hospital um with the little
[19:50] baby um
[19:54] you know they they had people going into
[19:55] their house taking things
[19:57] from from their house taking uh pretty
[20:00] much
[20:01] tearing down the house i mean they would
[20:02] actually tear down the house and take it
[20:04] for materials and and
[20:06] things like that but they would come
[20:07] home and and of course you know that
[20:10] they would be at the hospital more often
[20:12] than they were than they were at the
[20:13] house
[20:14] so um they decided to just leave this
[20:17] place he he what he did
[20:19] the brother did is he just took off the
[20:20] roof because that was all that was
[20:22] pretty much
[20:22] left in the in the house and decided to
[20:25] take it
[20:26] elsewhere and his mom helped supply
[20:29] a piece of property so that they could
[20:31] build a new house on top because this
[20:33] place
[20:34] they decided to leave it since it was so
[20:36] dangerous it was a dangerous area
[20:39] for them to live i mean you got robbers
[20:41] just going in all the time through
[20:43] through the place so they never asked me
[20:46] for anything i just took it upon my
[20:47] heart i said brother
[20:48] uh how much would it cost to build you a
[20:51] little place he said
[20:52] well just a little kitchen and a little
[20:54] living room and just
[20:55] one one bedroom for for him and
[20:58] his two for them and him his one
[21:01] daughter
[21:02] uh it only cost them like 4 200
[21:05] just about just to have them a little
[21:08] brand new place
[21:10] that they're going to build themselves
[21:12] and and they're going to
[21:14] and it's a safer area so if you want to
[21:17] if you want to
[21:18] skip to the next picture this is some
[21:21] i asked them to please take some
[21:22] pictures of how the structure
[21:25] ended up being and and things like that
[21:27] and
[21:28] and he did and next picture
[21:31] and next picture this is this is
[21:34] where they used to live next picture
[21:39] next and so i asked him
[21:42] to please send me exactly how how much
[21:44] everything would cost
[21:46] detailed and they did and so it come out
[21:49] in from converted to knit from
[21:51] nicaraguan money to
[21:53] us dollars it'd be like 4 200 next
[21:57] this is the family right here and that's
[22:00] brother um
[22:02] brother mario and his wife scarlett and
[22:05] i can't remember the little girl's name
[22:06] so i've worked sister scarlett
[22:10] uh with i've uh has a brother who who
[22:13] does mission work around the
[22:14] around the country and i've worked with
[22:16] him personally so
[22:17] uh they're very fine family very fun
[22:20] family and love the lord so
[22:22] you remember the family in prayer
[22:23] because haven't just
[22:25] lost their one-year-old baby and then
[22:27] not even have a
[22:28] home right now to live in is a terrible
[22:31] thing i'm
[22:32] pretty much homeless at the point right
[22:33] now and having to stay
[22:35] um at their parents home and at his
[22:38] parents home
[22:39] but they're a family and they should
[22:41] have their own home
[22:42] so next i think there's one or two more
[22:45] okay so that's it
[22:46] so uh i'm just bringing this need if you
[22:49] feel that you wanna help out
[22:51] i'm gonna send them some funds this
[22:52] coming week to them some of you have
[22:55] already

[26:17] there alone
[26:19] but the ship was now in the midst of the
[26:21] sea tossed with waves for the wind was
[26:23] contrary
[26:24] and in the fourth watch of the night
[26:26] jesus went unto them
[26:28] walking on the sea and when the
[26:30] disciples saw him walking on the sea
[26:33] they were troubled saying it is a spirit
[26:36] and they cried out for fear but
[26:38] straightway
[26:39] jesus spake unto them saying be of good
[26:41] cheer
[26:42] it is i be not afraid
[26:45] how many would just love to just have
[26:47] those words said directly to you amen
[26:50] praise god well he has he said him
[26:52] through his word
[26:54] amen and peter answered him and said
[26:57] lord
[26:58] if it be thou bid me come unto thee
[27:01] under water
[27:02] and he said come and when peter was come
[27:05] down
[27:06] out of the ship he walked on the water
[27:08] to go to jesus
[27:10] but when he saw the wind boisterous he
[27:12] was afraid and beginning to sink
[27:14] he cried saying lord save me and
[27:18] immediately jesus stretched forth his
[27:20] hand
[27:21] and caught him and said unto him oh thou
[27:24] of
[27:24] little faith wherefore did his doubt
[27:27] doubt
[27:28] and when they were come into the ship
[27:30] the wind ceased
[27:32] then they that were in the ship came and
[27:35] worshipped him saying
[27:37] of a truth thou art the son of god
[27:40] amen praise god so that's where we want
[27:42] to leave it off you may be seated this
[27:44] morning the lord had a blessing to his
[27:46] word
[27:48] amen i just want to title this this
[27:50] morning want to call it come
[27:52] amen just simply just come praise god
[27:55] and and uh we've read this this
[27:58] scripture
[27:59] many many times amen and you find it in
[28:02] different in different uh parts of the
[28:04] scriptures
[28:05] you'll even find it in john in in in the
[28:08] book of john
[28:09] but in matthew is the only time that we
[28:12] see
[28:12] where it actually talks about peter
[28:15] walking on the water
[28:17] amen peter walking on the water and you
[28:20] might say oh my that
[28:21] that's that's impossible you know a lot
[28:23] of people nowadays they want to
[28:25] try to prove that the message is wrong
[28:27] and and try to prove that the bible is
[28:29] wrong
[28:30] amen but but you see there's things in
[28:33] the word amen that we've got to just
[28:35] take by faith
[28:37] the christian life is not just about
[28:40] prove to me proof to me and and proof
[28:43] but it's about faith because if god
[28:45] if god could just prove everything to us
[28:47] and just hand it to us
[28:48] on a silver platter then you wouldn't
[28:51] need to have exercise your faith
[28:53] there's no purpose for you to exercise
[28:55] your faith if god just hands everything
[28:57] to you
[28:58] but amen for the fact that he has us
[29:00] guessing sometimes
[29:02] he's asked us he has us wondering
[29:04] sometimes
[29:05] amen that's the rea that's the reason
[29:07] that he just wants to
[29:08] exercise your faith think about that
[29:12] amen we don't have to explain anything
[29:14] jesus didn't
[29:15] ask you can you explain it when he would
[29:19] talk to the people
[29:21] can can no he said do you believe it
[29:25] do you believe it and that's all we have
[29:28] to do in this hour amen is just believe
[29:30] it praise god
[29:32] you know faith is mentioned in the old
[29:33] testament only two times
[29:36] the word faith right amen but in the in
[29:39] the new testament
[29:40] it's mentioned 245 times
[29:44] and we know that even so this tells me
[29:47] that even in the old testament amen when
[29:50] the
[29:50] the the saints in the old testament the
[29:53] great things that they did that's talked
[29:55] about in hebrews chapter 11
[29:59] and they and it was it was that was the
[30:01] faith that they had
[30:03] right nothing explained to them they
[30:05] just they the need was
[30:06] arose and they just acted upon it now
[30:09] here in the new testament man that we
[30:11] live in
[30:12] we talk about the faith our faith our
[30:14] faith amen lots
[30:16] about faith 240 times five times
[30:18] mentioned in the bible
[30:19] amen we must live by faith in this hour
[30:23] we must actually live by faith more than
[30:26] when we ever have lived by faith
[30:28] praise god our faith is very important
[30:30] praise the lord
[30:32] so i want to take a look at this at this
[30:34] uh this
[30:35] story here and just kind of work with it
[30:37] and see how the lord leads amen praise
[30:39] god
[30:40] and then and there in verse 22 it says
[30:42] and straightway jesus constrained
[30:44] his disciples to get into a ship and to
[30:47] go before him
[30:48] unto the other side while he sent the
[30:50] multitudes away this is
[30:51] this this happened right here just right
[30:54] after
[30:55] jesus had fed the the multitude about
[30:58] 5000 people
[30:59] actually and it was actually more
[31:02] because the 5000 was just only the man
[31:05] if you read in the scripture there was
[31:06] actually more it was more children there
[31:08] was women
[31:09] but they were not even counted it could
[31:11] have been 10 000
[31:12] that he fed with just two loaves and
[31:15] five
[31:15] five or five fish or two fish and five
[31:18] loaves of bread
[31:19] from a little boy's lunch box he fed ten
[31:22] thousand
[31:23] amen how much more he can he not feed
[31:26] you and take care of you amen
[31:29] if he could take the lunch box amen
[31:31] brother branham said he only used what
[31:33] the little boy gave
[31:34] gave to him and that's what the same
[31:36] thing with us
[31:37] god can only use what you give to him
[31:41] i've often said if you give him your arm
[31:43] that's the only thing that he can use if
[31:46] that's all you give him
[31:47] but if you give him all of yourself then
[31:49] he can use all of you
[31:51] sometimes the thing is is that we're
[31:53] like peter we don't we
[31:54] get afraid we don't want to go we don't
[31:56] want to take the next step amen but
[31:58] god wants to use all of you and all we
[32:01] give him is a little finger
[32:04] in other words you're not giving him all
[32:05] the full potential that
[32:07] that's in you amen but but god god is
[32:10] challenging us in this hour
[32:12] amen praise god god is god has
[32:14] challenges
[32:15] in us and is in the hour that we're
[32:17] living is to just come
[32:19] amen praise god amen so we see that that
[32:23] that you know the days of the of the
[32:26] great revivals and all those things amen
[32:28] those things are
[32:29] they're not here with us they'd be
[32:31] wonderful i mean
[32:32] who loves to be in a nice uh tent
[32:34] meeting and
[32:35] and the sawdust trail and all all that
[32:38] that's that's wonderful that's nice
[32:40] amen but do you know what saints right
[32:42] now god is dealing with us as
[32:44] individuals amen
[32:45] he's always been dealing with us as
[32:46] individuals but now more often than ever
[32:49] right amen more more it's it's an
[32:51] individual walk between you and god
[32:53] yes brother dale can't help you amen
[32:57] he can't push you to do anything even
[33:00] the holy spirit can't push you to do
[33:01] anything
[33:02] it's an individual walk between you and
[33:05] god
[33:06] you decide if you want to serve god amen
[33:09] you decide if you want to come to church
[33:11] amen you decide if you want to read the
[33:13] word you decide if you want to pray amen
[33:15] it's between you and god
[33:16] god can't push you just like brother
[33:18] dale's been
[33:19] speaking about predestination amen god
[33:21] doesn't take us through
[33:22] through a tube and push us through a
[33:24] tube and we come out the other side just
[33:26] you know in glorified bodies amen that's
[33:29] not how it works
[33:30] there's a decision amen there's a
[33:31] there's a there's a choice that you must
[33:33] make in this hour amen
[33:35] whether i'm going to move on with god or
[33:37] not
[33:40] it's limited to what we as ministers can
[33:42] do amen what we can do is pray for you

[33:44] do the rest that's right amen you've got
[33:47] to walk with god amen
[33:49] you've got to come amen before god amen
[33:52] you're the one
[33:53] who has to have that close relationship

[35:51] that hasn't been fulfilled
[35:54] somebody's got to fulfill that is that a
[35:56] greater work or not

[36:42] forward to but actually
[36:44] taking place within us now amen
[36:47] it's taking place the rapture is taking
[36:49] place from the inside and it manifests
[36:51] on the outside
[36:53] it's not something that just takes place
[36:54] on the outside it's got to start inside
[36:57] first
[36:57] remember the kingdom of god has to start
[36:59] taking place inside first that change
[37:02] and then it manifests on the outside
[37:04] praise the lord jesus amen

[37:34] word and you were called here to
[37:36] be the word and live the word and
[37:39] manifest the word to a dying people
[37:42] praise god that's desiring amen to see
[37:45] the word alive
[37:47] to see the word amen in power praise god
[37:51] hallelujah amen verse 23 there it says
[37:54] and when he had sent the multitudes away
[37:57] jesus had sent the multitudes away he
[37:59] went up into a mountain apart
[38:01] to pray and when the evening was come he
[38:04] was
[38:05] there alone amen in in john chapter six
[38:08] you can read another portion there of
[38:10] this of what happened there
[38:12] but in john chapter 6 15 he he went
[38:15] to to the mountain to pray alone because
[38:19] it says
[38:20] there that when jesus therefore
[38:21] perceived that they would that they
[38:23] would
[38:23] and take him by force to make him a king

[38:44] earthly kingdom amen but he wanted to
[38:46] establish that kingdom first in the
[38:48] people's hearts
[38:49] in the people's soul amen and when that
[38:51] kingdom is in your soul first amen then
[38:53] you can rule appropriately
[38:55] praise god amen then maybe he went up to
[38:59] a mountain up there also to pray for his
[39:01] disciples

[44:15] should have just taken god
[44:16] to take them as word amen
[44:20] but all of a sudden here comes this wind
[44:22] here comes the storm
[44:23] coming to our lives amen and it's just
[44:26] like us saints
[44:27] here god's given us his commandment amen
[44:30] to be saved and serve god
[44:32] amen and to live for him and then we
[44:34] think everything is going to be all
[44:36] right we're going to get
[44:37] there just fine jesus said so in his
[44:39] word we won't have any problems
[44:41] whatsoever there won't be
[44:42] any issues at all and then all of a
[44:44] sudden the wind starts howling
[44:47] the rain starts pouring and we're stuck
[44:50] in the middle of the sea
[44:52] not knowing exactly where to go
[44:55] i can't see far off but it doesn't
[44:57] matter he said that i'll meet you on the
[44:59] other side
[45:00] just keep roaring just keep rowing amen
[45:04] i'll meet you on the other side praise
[45:06] god amen
[45:08] i mean don't we feel like that sometimes
[45:09] right when we feel like god
[45:11] amen that he's abandoned us and that
[45:13] he's not with us amen but he's
[45:15] he's there amen interceding for you amen
[45:18] right there
[45:19] he was jesus was right there interceding
[45:22] for his disciples maybe he was probably
[45:24] looking out he knew exactly where they
[45:25] were at
[45:26] just like he knows exactly where you are
[45:28] in your problem
[45:30] he knows exactly what you need he knows
[45:32] exactly but he knows that you need to go
[45:34] through that
[45:35] just to get you to the point where he
[45:36] needs you to go
[45:38] from point a to point b amen she needs
[45:41] to go through that
[45:42] to get to point b he needs to go through
[45:45] that in order to get to point b
[45:47] amen god knows all these things but
[45:50] we sometimes think amen that he doesn't
[45:53] but the bible says that he's interceding
[45:56] for us the bible says that he is the
[45:57] high priest
[45:58] that can be touched by the feeling of
[46:00] our infirmities
[46:02] in other words he knows what you're
[46:03] going through he knows exactly
[46:05] he's been through it he's been he knows
[46:07] what it's like to be a human
[46:09] he knows what it's like to be a child he
[46:11] knows what it's like to be a young
[46:12] person
[46:13] amen he went through exactly what you're
[46:15] going through so don't think amen don't
[46:17] believe what satan says
[46:19] he i i don't know he does he's not
[46:22] mindful of what i'm going through he
[46:23] knows exactly what you're going through
[46:26] just have faith in his word have faith
[46:29] in his word that he said i'll meet you
[46:31] on the other side because he promised
[46:34] that he would
[46:35] yes amen hallelujah
[46:38] thank you amen
[46:41] you know sometimes things this ship that
[46:44] we're in amen
[46:45] that we're riding in it may get beaten

[47:06] far
[47:07] if he wanted you to go that certain
[47:09] point in your life that you went through
[47:11] something so hard
[47:12] if he wanted you to give up and let go
[47:14] right there and then you would have just
[47:15] done it then
[47:16] but yet you're still here you're still
[47:19] here walking amen you're still here
[47:21] amen desiring lord amen that means he's

[47:25] to get you to point b
[47:27] praise god he's still trying to get you
[47:29] to the other side
[47:31] but sometimes we're the ones who are no
[47:33] lord i don't want to i know
[47:36] but he's trying to get to the other side
[47:38] and he needs to bring us through the sea
[47:40] sometimes through the tumultuous seed
[47:43] don't you think that god didn't know
[47:44] that the disciples were going to go
[47:46] through a storm
[47:47] of course he knew i believe so i believe
[47:52] he went up there praying for them
[47:56] he was praying for his for his children
[47:58] for his disciples
[47:59] exactly knowing what they were going to
[48:01] go through praise god
[48:04] amen as the song goes the anchor holds

[50:59] your way
[51:01] amen praise god see in our minds he we
[51:04] think that he's late
[51:08] in our mind we think that when he shows
[51:10] up and finally gives the solution
[51:12] lord you're late you came late
[51:17] that's what martha or one of the two
[51:19] sisters told him when he came to
[51:20] resurrect lazarus
[51:22] lord if you had been here my brother
[51:25] wouldn't have died
[51:26] but if he would have been there amen it
[51:28] would have been it wouldn't have been a
[51:30] greater miracle
[51:31] amen that it was
[51:34] because god has a purpose for all things
[51:37] right amen
[51:38] see in your mind he's late but he's
[51:41] always on time
[51:43] amen the bible says i mean he's i think

[52:00] but when you're i like i like what
[52:02] brother dale says amen when you're when

[52:13] he's always on time he's never rushed
[52:18] he's never he's never it's not like
[52:20] things taken by surprise
[52:22] amen he knows exactly what you need
[52:25] to get you to point b amen to get you to
[52:28] get to the other side praise god
[52:31] amen so you got to remember that jesus
[52:34] had already told him
[52:35] that he was going to meet them on the
[52:36] other side amen
[52:38] amen praise the lord and jesus he knew
[52:41] that they were going to get to the other
[52:43] side because
[52:44] you know he had to meet them there he
[52:45] hit that same faith amen that jesus had
[52:48] for them
[52:49] his disciples to get to the other side
[52:50] it's the same faith that
[52:52] he has for you and me that you're going
[52:53] to make it to the other side amen
[52:55] amen the bible says that he didn't start
[52:58] this work in you to just leave you alone
[53:00] afterwards he said the work that he's
[53:03] begun in you he will perform it
[53:05] to the day of the lord jesus christ
[53:09] in other words he'll take care of the
[53:10] rest just stay with his word amen
[53:14] praise god now verse 25 says and in the
[53:16] fourth watch of the night
[53:18] jesus went unto them walking on the
[53:19] scene now we just read that amen
[53:21] and we find that uh jesus had them
[53:24] exactly where he wanted them to be
[53:27] amen in the darkest night time of the of
[53:30] the night
[53:31] it wasn't in the early days it wasn't in
[53:33] the early in the evening
[53:34] hours amen it was in the darkest time he
[53:37] had them exactly where he wanted them to
[53:39] be so that he could
[53:40] manifest himself and god has you exactly
[53:44] where he wants you to be saints
[53:47] god god knows amen why he allows things
[53:50] in your life
[53:50] praise the lord and it's not to harm you
[53:54] but to help you amen john 6
[53:57] 8 amen the bible says this i i never
[54:01] i didn't know this this verse existed
[54:03] but it says it says there that
[54:05] which alone talking about god it says
[54:07] which alone spreadeth out the heavens
[54:10] and treadeth upon the waves of the sea
[54:13] amen see the disciples should have known
[54:16] that god can do that
[54:21] because they read it in the word that he
[54:24] can walk on the sea he created the sea
[54:27] so he can walk on it he could do he's
[54:29] the master of the sea
[54:30] amen praise god so as job says there and
[54:34] treadeth upon the waves of the sea
[54:37] but what happened was here look at verse
[54:39] 26 and when the disciples saw him
[54:41] walking on the sea
[54:42] they were troubled saying
[54:46] it is a spirit and they cried
[54:49] out for fear
[54:52] brother said often the thing that could
[54:55] help you
[54:55] is what you're afraid of we're often so
[54:59] scared of the thing
[55:00] that can help you and yet that's the
[55:03] thing that can
[55:03] real that's the thing that can really
[55:06] help you amen
[55:08] we're afraid of that that can help us
[55:11] the disciples amen the jews at that time
[55:13] uh i was just reading a little bit they
[55:15] were especially the pharisees they were
[55:17] very superstitious
[55:19] and so they believed a lot in demons
[55:21] they believed a lot and all those things
[55:23] and they believed
[55:23] on they believed in one that would
[55:26] actually
[55:26] come and take the little children at
[55:30] night
[55:32] and and those i don't know what the name
[55:33] of the demon was but
[55:35] they had all these superstitions in
[55:37] their in their in their mind
[55:39] and so the disciples they grew up with
[55:41] these superstitions you see
[55:43] amen and plus they were sailors
[55:46] and so sailors you know they have their
[55:48] own superstition about things and stuff
[55:50] like that amen
[55:51] and here comes jesus walking to them in
[55:54] the water
[55:54] and they've stopped fearing the wind
[55:58] and the rain and more they they forgot
[56:00] about that because they thought
[56:02] a ghost was coming to him that's what
[56:05] the bible says
[56:06] they feared that a spirit was coming to
[56:09] them to do some harm to them
[56:12] not knowing that it was god's it was it
[56:14] was the holy spirit
[56:17] praise god because jesus is the spirit
[56:19] amen
[56:20] right god himself amen coming to them
[56:23] and they were afraid of that that could
[56:25] really help them during that time
[56:27] things i wonder if that's how we are
[56:30] here goes the word amen here comes
[56:32] something that
[56:33] that's taken amen the solution in your
[56:36] life
[56:36] and we're afraid of it because it
[56:39] doesn't meet our expectation
[56:42] it doesn't come the way we think it
[56:43] should come right
[56:45] amen we're afraid of it and that we
[56:47] can't get any results then
[56:49] amen you can only get results from the
[56:52] word if you believe the word amen
[56:57] the word amen is the solution
[57:00] but if you don't believe it you can't
[57:02] get results from it
[57:04] amen and believing it is to act upon it
[57:08] see your faith amen can't just be
[57:10] intellectual
[57:12] it has to take action it has to take
[57:15] action your faith has to take action in
[57:18] order for things to happen
[57:20] right right amen do think about the
[57:23] the impo even if you look crazy or if
[57:26] you look dumb
[57:26] amen still do it right because without
[57:30] it in in
[57:31] action faith in action it doesn't it
[57:34] doesn't it won't work
[57:36] amen then it just becomes just
[57:39] head knowledge amen we got too much of
[57:42] that
[57:43] we need action now amen too much about
[57:46] to many of us we know the word
[57:48] now it's time to take action glory amen
[57:50] take action on the word
[57:52] it's time to take action amen right how
[57:54] are we going to
[57:55] come into a body change amen taking
[57:57] action having faith in his word amen
[58:00] believing his word amen acting upon it
[58:02] amen when a little problem comes hits
[58:04] your life or something even big comes
[58:06] hits your life
[58:07] amen take action lord you are allowing
[58:10] this for me to get from point a to point
[58:11] b
[58:12] and if point b amen has a body change
[58:14] then lord let it be
[58:17] i'm coming to it amen i'm coming to it i
[58:21] don't care what
[58:22] what needs to happen sure it's hard sure
[58:24] stuff the losing of a loved one is hard
[58:27] somebody's sick in your family is tough
[58:29] uh children that are gone astray not
[58:31] even serving the lord amen
[58:32] that's hard amen but
[58:36] lord if this is what i've got to go
[58:37] through because remember when god is
[58:39] allowing things in our lives
[58:40] he's not just doing it for the person
[58:42] amen for that person amen
[58:44] he's also doing it for the people around
[58:46] you as well
[58:48] amen the influence is around you yeah
[58:52] right god god allows the situations for
[58:56] many different purposes right not just
[58:58] for you

[59:04] whole picture the whole picture

[59:11] message be not afraid of his eyes he
[59:13] says but the very thing that could help
[59:15] them and the only thing that could help
[59:17] them they were afraid of it
[59:20] and today it's the same thing they're
[59:21] afraid to take
[59:23] a hold of the holy spirit they're afraid
[59:25] to believe
[59:26] god's message they're afraid to believe
[59:30] the holy spirit when they see it working
[59:32] among them
[59:33] they'll say now wait a minute i don't
[59:34] know whether it could be for me or not

[1:02:48] have to feel him amen he gave us his
[1:02:50] word amen
[1:02:52] you don't have to feel anything nobody
[1:02:55] he said did you feel it no
[1:02:56] he asked did you believe it that's what
[1:02:59] he asked the people there
[1:03:00] in the bible did you feel something no i
[1:03:03] didn't feel anything well
[1:03:04] then then then to believe it amen
[1:03:09] and and peter answered him and said lord
[1:03:12] now watch this i want to get now to kind
[1:03:14] of the meat of the of the messes and
[1:03:15] peter answered him and said lord
[1:03:17] if it be thou bid me come
[1:03:20] unto thee on the water so when peter
[1:03:24] heard that voice amen
[1:03:26] now remember the winds were still
[1:03:28] blowing
[1:03:30] the rain was still coming through it was
[1:03:32] still the darkest time of the night
[1:03:34] but when peter heard that voice
[1:03:38] it sparked the faith in him right there
[1:03:40] to say
[1:03:42] something as ridiculous as that
[1:03:46] it it it it's ridiculous
[1:03:49] why in the world i mean it has it makes
[1:03:52] no sense whatsoever
[1:03:54] but it sparks something in him and say
[1:03:56] lord if it be you
[1:03:58] bid me to come unto thee
[1:04:02] and you know what jesus told him he
[1:04:04] didn't argue with him
[1:04:06] he didn't say he didn't say peter you're
[1:04:07] not born again
[1:04:09] you don't have the holy ghost right you
[1:04:11] don't you don't you don't
[1:04:12] he didn't give him the greek or the
[1:04:14] hebrew or anything like that
[1:04:16] he said come
[1:04:19] see sometimes we want to give somebody
[1:04:22] amen we want to give them the greek we
[1:04:23] want to explain to them
[1:04:24] everything and you think that by
[1:04:26] explaining every single little detail
[1:04:28] amen point a b c d amen are you born
[1:04:31] again yet
[1:04:33] and you realize that that doesn't work
[1:04:36] amen just tell them come
[1:04:40] just you you want to do it if you really
[1:04:44] want to do it then just come
[1:04:46] amen sometimes us explaining too much
[1:04:50] and giving too much
[1:04:51] uh explanation about things might even
[1:04:54] harm more than
[1:04:54] than it helps amen
[1:04:58] sometimes our families amen aren't ready
[1:05:00] to receive certain things yet
[1:05:02] and all they need to hear is just come
[1:05:05] just come to church amen what did uh
[1:05:09] i believe it was andrew amen that told
[1:05:11] james or
[1:05:12] jesus said we've seen the messiah he
[1:05:14] said come see
[1:05:16] really you've seen him just come see
[1:05:18] come see for yourself
[1:05:20] amen and see what the good lord has
[1:05:22] given us
[1:05:23] amen but peter
[1:05:26] this sparked something in peter amen
[1:05:29] and he didn't care amen he didn't care
[1:05:31] what the others were saying
[1:05:32] amen he didn't care amen about about
[1:05:35] what the disciples were getting ready to
[1:05:37] say to him or what they were thinking
[1:05:38] amen he just said lord
[1:05:40] if it be you bid me to come
[1:05:43] and the disciples probably thought man
[1:05:45] what that's strange peter's asking such
[1:05:47] a thing amen that's weird but peter
[1:05:50] didn't care
[1:05:51] right he still he said lord you bid me
[1:05:53] to come
[1:05:54] amen remember peter was not even born
[1:05:56] again
[1:05:59] peter didn't even have the holy ghost
[1:06:01] during this time
[1:06:03] amen think about that saints
[1:06:08] you who say who have the holy ghost and
[1:06:11] get a man caught up in a frenzy amen by
[1:06:13] every single thing in your life amen
[1:06:17] there's no need for that
[1:06:19] that's right amen when all you have to
[1:06:22] do is
[1:06:22] just come have faith in his word
[1:06:26] amen have faith in his word amen
[1:06:31] now brother branham talks about that
[1:06:33] spur of a moment faith
[1:06:35] amen look what he says here amen because
[1:06:37] that's what peter had there
[1:06:38] at that moment brother brahm says i want
[1:06:41] to tell you something now
[1:06:42] work on that pulsation that spur
[1:06:45] of a moment like joshua did like mary
[1:06:48] magdalene
[1:06:48] all those just that moment when
[1:06:51] something is revealed to you
[1:06:53] grab it amen
[1:06:56] hold to it that spur of a moment praise
[1:07:00] god
[1:07:01] amen and so as as the word is going
[1:07:03] forth and
[1:07:04] and something reveals to you something
[1:07:06] reveals to you my child will be
[1:07:08] will be healed my son will come to the
[1:07:10] lord or whatever it is amen
[1:07:13] if that is revealed to you then satan
[1:07:15] can't take that away from you
[1:07:16] amen hold to that and take advantage of
[1:07:19] that right there and then
[1:07:21] amen because that will stay with you
[1:07:24] amen
[1:07:24] that will anchor you that will help
[1:07:26] anchor you and this is exactly what
[1:07:28] peter i believe what peter
[1:07:30] amen when he heard that familiar voice
[1:07:32] of jesus amen
[1:07:33] it caused a spur of the moment faith
[1:07:35] right there in him
[1:07:37] see a spur of the moment of faith and to
[1:07:40] say
[1:07:40] lord if it's you tell me to come right
[1:07:43] right
[1:07:44] bid me to come amen praise god
[1:07:48] hold on to whatever it is amen god was
[1:07:51] revealing to you amen don't let satan
[1:07:53] take it out
[1:07:54] and take it out of you and you see god
[1:07:56] amen man
[1:07:57] come on the scene amen because that's
[1:07:59] you believing his word
[1:08:02] that's you believing and taking hold
[1:08:04] right there anchoring yourself to that
[1:08:06] word
[1:08:07] amen and he said come that's what jesus
[1:08:10] told him
[1:08:12] he said come in verse 29 and when peter
[1:08:14] was come down out of the ship
[1:08:17] he walked on the water to go to jesus
[1:08:20] now i want you to put yourself in
[1:08:22] peter's shoes
[1:08:25] amen here here is on the boat
[1:08:28] storm's still going man the storm's
[1:08:30] still going right now
[1:08:32] there and and and all everything's going
[1:08:35] around and
[1:08:36] and and he's told to come
[1:08:40] and so he just gets out and starts
[1:08:43] walking
[1:08:44] amen just takes god that just takes
[1:08:47] jesus at his word
[1:08:49] and starts walking walking on water
[1:08:52] and man he might be walking like a
[1:08:53] little baby
[1:08:55] you know but he's walking i want to see
[1:08:58] you try to walk on water
[1:09:00] right and people criticize peter amen
[1:09:03] because he sunk
[1:09:04] but he walked on water have you walked
[1:09:06] on water
[1:09:08] amen he started walking away maybe he
[1:09:12] was
[1:09:12] walking a little taking little baby
[1:09:14] steps maybe he even went a little
[1:09:16] backwards sometimes amen but he was
[1:09:18] walking on water
[1:09:19] amen but t bring that
[1:09:22] down to our level saying say amen don't
[1:09:25] criticize the brother who's walking amen
[1:09:27] just little bits here and there amen
[1:09:29] who's hanging on amen a little bit here
[1:09:32] and there or
[1:09:32] or if you're taking the strut maybe
[1:09:34] you're not taking the strides that you

[1:09:41] amen that's all you got to worry about
[1:09:44] amen worry about the end goal
[1:09:45] amen don't worry about your
[1:09:47] circumstances amen peter

[1:09:51] that it was the winds were howling and
[1:09:53] the disciples were criticizing him i
[1:09:55] mean look i can't believe that he's
[1:09:57] doing that

[1:10:45] get they get fearful amen because of
[1:10:47] what such and such might say if i do
[1:10:49] this
[1:10:50] amen that or the other if i take this
[1:10:52] step in my life amen

[1:11:40] wait wait a second your faith
[1:11:42] you you have wavering faith no he just
[1:11:44] said come

[1:11:48] to come
[1:11:50] well no peter he didn't start explaining
[1:11:52] that you know this that or the other two
[1:11:54] and the
[1:11:54] amen he said come peter
[1:11:58] praise god amen
[1:12:02] god doesn't put limits on our christian
[1:12:05] walk
[1:12:07] he doesn't you and i are the ones who
[1:12:10] put those limits on our walk
[1:12:12] you and i as i said earlier you give him
[1:12:14] your arm
[1:12:16] that's all he'll use you give him
[1:12:18] everything

[1:12:22] limit ourselves
[1:12:23] from receiving god's blessings praise
[1:12:26] god
[1:12:27] amen peter heard that word amen and it
[1:12:30] was sufficient enough for him to hear
[1:12:32] that voice
[1:12:33] the word said so i believe it that
[1:12:35] settles it i'm going
[1:12:37] amen see faith is simply taking the next
[1:12:41] step
[1:12:42] that's what faith is it's just taking
[1:12:45] the next step in your life
[1:12:47] it seems hard it seems difficult but
[1:12:50] just take it
[1:12:51] amen because it'll unleash the
[1:12:53] supernatural
[1:12:54] but when he saw the wind boisterous he
[1:12:56] was afraid now
[1:12:57] speaking about peter he when he saw the
[1:12:59] wind boisterous he was afraid and
[1:13:01] beginning to sink
[1:13:02] he cried saying lord save me
[1:13:05] amen don't look at your problems in your
[1:13:07] life right

[1:13:14] pandemic going on outside just keep

[1:13:17] amen biden's doing such and such just
[1:13:19] keep walking
[1:13:21] amen cnn says such and such just keep
[1:13:23] walking
[1:13:24] fox news says such and such you just
[1:13:26] keep walking amen
[1:13:28] praise god just keep walking don't don't
[1:13:30] put your eye on the winds and on the
[1:13:32] storm and don't put your eye on the
[1:13:34] critics
[1:13:34] amen keep walking amen
[1:13:37] jesus said so you just keep walking come
[1:13:40] on
[1:13:41] remember he said come just go
[1:13:44] amen keep walking sometimes we fix our
[1:13:48] our pr our eyes on on the things of life
[1:13:50] so much amen and we forget
[1:13:52] where we came from we forget
[1:13:55] we lose our first love right man have
[1:13:58] you ever been that way
[1:14:00] that love and that zeal that you had for
[1:14:02] god when you first came to god
[1:14:05] and you and then you start thinking and
[1:14:07] looking at
[1:14:08] all these other things around you in
[1:14:10] life and i got a family now you know i
[1:14:12] got
[1:14:13] my children and i got to work and this
[1:14:15] and
[1:14:16] and then you forget amen how it was
[1:14:20] that first love to serve god
[1:14:23] you don't even spend time with him
[1:14:25] anymore the way you should
[1:14:27] right amen do that five minute quick
[1:14:30] prayer in the morning
[1:14:32] amen when you used to get up an hour
[1:14:34] early just just to pray
[1:14:36] not even to eat breakfast just to pray
[1:14:39] amen let's get back to the first love
[1:14:43] amen praise god
[1:14:46] and immediately jesus stretched forth
[1:14:48] his hand to see i like that
[1:14:50] that even though peter was sinking jesus
[1:14:53] didn't rebuke him he said you see
[1:14:55] you see i told you right no he just
[1:14:58] immediately picked him up he immediately
[1:15:02] picked him up
[1:15:06] he didn't he didn't he didn't start
[1:15:08] quoting him he didn't he didn't say you
[1:15:10] unbeliever you know he didn't say you
[1:15:13] you you you non-christian you you need
[1:15:16] the holy ghost that's the reason why you
[1:15:17] were sinking
[1:15:19] no he didn't tell him none of that he
[1:15:21] said oh ye of little faith you may be
[1:15:23] sit down right
[1:15:24] he said oh ye of little faith glory now
[1:15:27] i want you to understand this saints
[1:15:29] that god often times jesus would tell
[1:15:32] the the people that he would heal
[1:15:33] he would say it's by your faith that
[1:15:36] you've been healed
[1:15:37] it's by your faith that you received
[1:15:39] such and such
[1:15:40] it's not a super-duper faith that you
[1:15:43] need
[1:15:44] now i want you to pay attention to this
[1:15:46] and think about this you don't need a
[1:15:48] super-duper
[1:15:49] faith to grow in you in order to get
[1:15:51] what you need
[1:15:53] you only need to use what you have
[1:15:55] already
[1:15:57] use the faith that god has given you
[1:15:59] sure there's
[1:16:00] people with with a stronger faith amen
[1:16:03] maybe than you
[1:16:04] or or or or but see saints they can only
[1:16:07] act upon the faith that god's given them
[1:16:09] right or use what god has given you
[1:16:12] now and only with that amen it's not the
[1:16:15] quantity of the faith it's the quality
[1:16:17] of the faith
[1:16:19] the the the bible jesus talked about the
[1:16:21] the green of mustard if your faith can
[1:16:23] be
[1:16:24] be of the size of a grain of mustard
[1:16:26] seed you can move mountain
[1:16:27] really if you look at it it's not the
[1:16:29] actual size of the faith it's not
[1:16:31] because it's smaller because it's big
[1:16:33] it's the quality of that grain it's the
[1:16:35] quality of that seed
[1:16:37] amen and it's the quality amen of the
[1:16:39] holy ghost the same
[1:16:41] the portion the small portion of holy
[1:16:42] spirit that god has given you the down
[1:16:44] payment that he has given you
[1:16:46] is the same it has the same properties
[1:16:48] as
[1:16:49] as god's full amen see of eternal life
[1:16:53] the same little teaspoon of ocean water
[1:16:56] that you can get from the ocean
[1:16:58] it has the same properties that the
[1:17:01] whole ocean
[1:17:02] has so use it
[1:17:05] use that little bit of faith that you
[1:17:07] have
[1:17:09] because it's that's exactly what jesus
[1:17:11] told peter here amen oh ye of little
[1:17:13] faith
[1:17:14] not necessarily telling him you don't
[1:17:15] have such a great faith
[1:17:17] amen you didn't use you you forgot
[1:17:20] you stopped using what you already had
[1:17:22] peter didn't walk out
[1:17:23] he didn't he didn't read he didn't read
[1:17:26] a man a lot of
[1:17:27] a lot of stuff right before he walked
[1:17:29] out on the boat he just heard come and
[1:17:30] he just walked out
[1:17:31] right right he didn't get time
[1:17:34] have time to prepare he didn't have time
[1:17:36] to do that amen just amen sometimes you
[1:17:38] got to step out on faith on things you
[1:17:42] just got to
[1:17:44] and say lord i'm i'm doing this
[1:17:47] and then then let let the water just
[1:17:49] hold me up
[1:17:50] amen but i'm i'm going because your word
[1:17:53] said so
[1:17:53] right amen amen these saints
[1:17:57] god is not going to allow more in your
[1:17:59] life than than what you can handle
[1:18:01] he never has and he never will
[1:18:05] he's not going to put more in your life
[1:18:07] that you can hand you can't handle
[1:18:09] and immediately jesus stretched forth
[1:18:11] his hand and caught him and said unto
[1:18:12] him
[1:18:13] oh thou of little faith wherefore didest
[1:18:16] thou doubt in other words why did you
[1:18:19] doubt peter
[1:18:20] you were going such a good way you you
[1:18:23] you were believing my word amen and
[1:18:25] brother so and so said something to you
[1:18:27] and now
[1:18:28] you're just all shattered into pieces
[1:18:31] now
[1:18:32] amen this happened in your life and now
[1:18:34] you're just you're just broken you
[1:18:35] complete you can't you can't seem to
[1:18:37] move on amen
[1:18:38] amen why did you doubt you were
[1:18:41] believing my word when everything was
[1:18:42] going good
[1:18:46] why can't you believe my word now that's
[1:18:48] when we need to believe god's word
[1:18:50] when everything is going bad
[1:18:52] everything's not going our way
[1:18:54] that's when we need to believe god's
[1:18:55] word amen
[1:18:57] amen praise the lord and skip ahead and
[1:19:00] amen and when and when they were coming
[1:19:04] to the ship
[1:19:05] the wind ceased now i want to ask you a
[1:19:08] question saints
[1:19:09] when when jesus picked peter back up
[1:19:12] amen
[1:19:14] how do you think peter got back to the
[1:19:16] boat
[1:19:20] do you ever think about that
[1:19:24] it must have been that he walked back
[1:19:26] again to the boat
[1:19:28] because the bible doesn't say that jesus
[1:19:30] picked him up and carried him to the
[1:19:32] boat
[1:19:34] it must have been that when he picked
[1:19:35] him up he got him back on his feet again
[1:19:38] walking on the water amen sometimes we
[1:19:40] fall
[1:19:41] sometimes we fail sometimes we do things
[1:19:43] that we're not supposed to do
[1:19:44] brother branham said that we willfully
[1:19:47] sometimes do
[1:19:48] things wrong amen he still he knows your
[1:19:51] heart
[1:19:51] in that repentant heart of yours amen he
[1:19:53] picks you up amen and
[1:19:55] he's still walking amen but you're not
[1:19:57] by yourself
[1:19:58] amen peter wasn't by himself amen now
[1:20:01] that he's back up again walking amen
[1:20:03] jesus was holding his hand this
[1:20:04] time amen he wasn't walking by himself
[1:20:07] this time
[1:20:08] amen jesus was walking with peter back
[1:20:10] to the boat
[1:20:12] i believe that right amen
[1:20:16] i mean wouldn't you amen when something
[1:20:18] happens in your life and you went
[1:20:19] through it amen and god's
[1:20:21] uh delivered you god helped you through
[1:20:24] something amen
[1:20:25] don't you think that would cause faith
[1:20:27] in your life
[1:20:29] amen to grow even more than what you had
[1:20:31] it at the beginning of the trial
[1:20:33] amen i believe peter walked back to the
[1:20:36] boat with jesus
[1:20:37] amen praise the lord
[1:20:42] it doesn't matter what you've done
[1:20:43] saints amen right doesn't matter what's
[1:20:45] happened in your life
[1:20:47] god is a god of many chances
[1:20:50] god is a god of many many chances
[1:20:53] amen we limit god amen we limit god but
[1:20:56] god is a god of many chances
[1:20:59] praise the lord amen but it it was
[1:21:02] it was peter's uh his that spontaneous
[1:21:07] faith that he had amen
[1:21:08] that allowed him to walk on water amen
[1:21:13] that's the faith that we need amen that
[1:21:15] same faith that
[1:21:16] that we have in jesus amen
[1:21:21] and saint peter did this without the
[1:21:22] holy ghost
[1:21:24] how much can we do amen with the holy
[1:21:26] ghost in our lives
[1:21:28] amen peter walked on water without the
[1:21:31] holy ghost
[1:21:33] what can we do with the holy ghost amen
[1:21:39] and then when they got to the water when
[1:21:41] they got to the boat
[1:21:43] i'm almost done here but i got hot there
[1:21:45] for a moment
[1:21:47] when they got to the boat the bible says
[1:21:49] that they the the storm ceased
[1:21:52] amen when they got to the boat the wind
[1:21:55] stopped
[1:21:56] amen it's when you get to point b that
[1:21:59] everything will truly stop in your life
[1:22:01] amen
[1:22:03] but as far as as far as this world is
[1:22:05] concerned amen
[1:22:07] amen things amen
[1:22:10] you be a new beginning i mean there's no
[1:22:12] ending to god now
[1:22:13] god is god is eternal amen it's a circle
[1:22:16] that just keeps going around and around
[1:22:18] and around there's no ending
[1:22:19] to it amen praise god but when they got
[1:22:22] back to that boat that's when things
[1:22:24] ceased amen then they that were in the
[1:22:26] ship came and worshiped him saying of a
[1:22:28] truth
[1:22:29] thou art the son of god amen satan would
[1:22:33] want to really sift your life
[1:22:35] amen remember he in in luke chapter 22
[1:22:40] uh verse 31 there it says and uh
[1:22:44] jesus speaking to peter he said and the
[1:22:45] lord said simon simon behold
[1:22:48] satan hath desired to have you that he
[1:22:50] may sift you as wheat
[1:22:52] that's how that's how satan is doing to
[1:22:54] some of us sometimes amen
[1:22:57] just sifting us as we just doing what he
[1:22:58] wants to do
[1:23:00] amen but but look what jesus says there
[1:23:03] he says but i have prayed for thee
[1:23:06] that that that thy faith failed not
[1:23:08] right
[1:23:09] amen
[1:23:13] he knew he knew that peter's faith amen
[1:23:15] was going to be challenged again
[1:23:17] in a greater way than than it was
[1:23:20] than walking on the water we think oh my
[1:23:23] peter walked on water that's
[1:23:25] awesome faith that's great faith no it
[1:23:27] was greater faith amen to stay with the
[1:23:29] word
[1:23:31] you see but peter peter or jesus prayed
[1:23:35] for him
[1:23:36] and you know what saints jesus prayed
[1:23:38] for us as well
[1:23:40] he prayed for us in john chapter 17.
[1:23:43] amen do you want to read his own words
[1:23:45] about what he said about you
[1:23:47] read john chapter 17. when whenever
[1:23:50] satan comes in and starts attacking your
[1:23:52] mind whenever satan comes in and start
[1:23:54] and starts working in your
[1:23:55] in your mind about this that or the
[1:23:58] other amen read john 17.
[1:24:01] read what he said about you read what
[1:24:04] read the faith amen that that he is
[1:24:08] speaking amen about us having amen even
[1:24:11] in the hour
[1:24:12] that we're living in praise god
[1:24:16] because he wants you to come to a point
[1:24:17] where you say it's not my will lord
[1:24:19] amen but it's dying amen
[1:24:24] jesus greatest trial amen was was dying
[1:24:27] to himself during the garden of
[1:24:28] gethsemane
[1:24:30] do you believe that that was the
[1:24:32] greatest trial that he ever had i mean
[1:24:34] it was probably worse than even
[1:24:36] than even dying on the cross
[1:24:39] to die to himself so that his word can
[1:24:44] work through his life so that he could
[1:24:45] fulfill his purpose
[1:24:48] that was the worst trial amen and i know
[1:24:50] that's hard it's tough for
[1:24:51] for us to to uh amen to give in to
[1:24:55] our to to the word amen and let the word
[1:24:59] do the work in our lives amen
[1:25:01] it's hard it's hard because
[1:25:04] we want to let the flesh take over amen
[1:25:07] but
[1:25:08] you've got to come to lord is not my
[1:25:10] will but thine will be
[1:25:12] done amen and you see that when you do
[1:25:16] that
[1:25:16] the bible says there that jesus was
[1:25:18] ministered to by angels
[1:25:20] angels came down and ministered to jesus
[1:25:22] amen even in that time
[1:25:24] because he sacrificed himself amen for
[1:25:27] the greater purpose
[1:25:29] to get to point b amen they believe the
[1:25:32] disciples got to
[1:25:33] to where they needed to get amen but
[1:25:36] they needed to go through that amen
[1:25:38] in order for it for i mean to learn
[1:25:40] something in their life to increase
[1:25:41] their faith
[1:25:42] same thing with each one of us saints
[1:25:44] we've got to go through things in life
[1:25:46] amen
[1:25:47] christian walk isn't easy christian walk
[1:25:49] is not a flowery bread of the
[1:25:50] bed of ease amen but it's a walk of
[1:25:53] promise
[1:25:55] it's a walk of it's a walk of of reward
[1:25:57] amen
[1:25:59] it's a god is never god doesn't promise
[1:26:02] things to be easy but god promises
