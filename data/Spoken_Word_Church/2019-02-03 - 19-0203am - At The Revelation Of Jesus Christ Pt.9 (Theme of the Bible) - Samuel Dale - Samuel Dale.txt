been reading from first Peter 1 and then we'll go to revelations 2 first Peter 1 revelations to remember the announcements that have been made in things the upcoming events and now the fellowship meeting will be the third Saturday in March at brother lung gooris remember to cover the point in getting into the church ages and maybe today we just move in a little bit to see our point in a cover from that you know in the word and seeing because what's been our point we've been talking about how the Bible was written that's our whole goal to see that part and if we can see how the Book of Revelations comes into being then we see how that you know that the whole Bible comes into being and all onto that point so just remember that first Peter 1 and revelations to the heavenly Father we thank you for this day and your love and your grace thank you for all things we just ask you now that you'd come among us in a mighty way and open our understanding to thy word because that's our desire that's the reason for gathering is to see you and to see you in the word and how you manifest yourself and let that then come forth as alive into our hearts and our lives that we may see you father we ask you to be with a sick that's among us just touch each one and let your light be their Lord to deliver them from those things and the problems because we believe your word that by your stripes were healed and we thank you for it have your way now as we read your words you come and speak to our hearts in Jesus name first Peter 1:7 that's a trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perishes though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and glory or at the appearing of Jesus Christ right they remember they're peering into coming he's appearing now among his mom his the world in healings and signs and wonders but his coming is in the bride or manifestation to her whom having not seen you love and him though now you see him not yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you know it's prophesying of it they did back there searching what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves and that was made known to them you know but they couldn't see the end of it unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost senior disciples already at this time we're out preaching of what the Old Testament spoke of and to bring into manifestation sit down from heaven which things the angels desire to look into wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ let's just stop there and we'll continue this on You Father we thank you and we ask you now to just bless us bless your word we committed all into your hands God in Jesus name Amen you may be seated cuz we're gonna get to revelations 2 anyway [Applause] and as I will say it now what's our point what does it been we've been talking about the writing or the bringing forth of the Bible now brother Branham says that Christ mister God revealed that Jesus Christ is the central theme of the entire Bible all right so what we're going to be dealing with today is the point of the theme of the Bible okay too far okay got it see the the theme of the Bible the theme a theme is like a you know something you're doing like a composition your writing or our subject that you're trying to bring forth and and to to do and really it comes into a point of talking like taken from the word composition because that's really what a theme is and a composition is like many things brought together to form one point the you're making a composition of something it means a lot of things brought together and see that's what the Bible is it's God's plan and purpose of salvation and it's of bringing together all of those things which would be a thing here in this part here see the Old Testament had their part all right see then the New Testament started brot it's part you know the Lord Jesus walking on earth then you know come on in to the book of Acts and then now talking in the church ages so then it's it's forming a written word are a manifested a live word because that's the point see the word has always been alive it's mankind the one that didn't have it in the line of the light the word itself is alive in art but now get that get that statement and keep it that it's many things a composition is many things that is finally brought together each one is speaking off finally pointing to one thing all right so now no matter where you would read in the Bible all right when you read in the Bible the Prophet said if you don't see Christ in every verse he said go back and read it again he said cause you missed him all right see then that's many things many manifestations that he's had like reading that of the the Peter there that those Old Testament prophets they knew something was going on but they couldn't see totally down to the end of it but they knew that they were were involved in something and but they were waiting for a time to see it and they they never did see it coming to reality see because finally Jesus Christ did step forth from that but yet the Old Testament part those those prophets and things were already passed on they couldn't see the end of what they were trying to bring the Peter said we would see the end of our salvation the salvation of our souls right we'd come to the end because that's what's been spoken in other words tied all together and what I'm saying everything you studying the word to see Christ and you're coming down and you're you're bringing it to a a collection or a topic because that's another word for thing is like a topic and you're bringing it down to that and everything in our will speak of Jesus Christ all right and see because he's the theme of the entire Bible hey now in following that then we can come to fourth because my point has been we may read in the Old Testament and see the writings and see the things and try to bring that together but when you come to the Book of Revelations you're coming to something that you're not necessarily writing the now it'll be in there so just hold a point but you're not Nestor buckle Revelation is not necessarily writing the past the Book of Revelations I've tried to emphasize the Book of Revelations is the alive word now remember what we're saying John wrote after Paul died which that don't change anything because in the days of Paul the Word was alive when you enter the New Testament remember you're no longer prophesying right you're coming to a reality of the Living Word you're not trying to prophesy of it or show it alright then see it can speak of future things but not not necessarily see that's where the Prophet said it you know on the message search we would see Jesus that is quoting the other day they see that people find the greatest he said the greatest hindrance is people try to build something in the past or something well over in the future and said you're missing it and it's so high that no one can reach it quoting what he says from the sir he said it's so high nobody can reach that what because you've had it in the pies are you putting it in the future now listen to words what he said now that's just the devil doing that so the devil is trying to keep you confused so he builds opponent and talks of the past and he'll talk of the future but he doesn't want you to think about anything present tense all right now may I say this with the doubts in our mind the new birth cannot be a heist hence the new birth cannot be a future tense the new birth is a present tense something happening right now now there's more to go in the new birth right more growth developments all that right wonderful but just remember the new birth the new birth is present tense alright and see brother branham I like this one too words he's talking about the I am he said now from the message look away to Jesus he said when Moses draw close to it to take off your shoes for I am now if you would weigh that word I am it's past tense present tense and future tense I am eternal okay now remember what he said to Moses just to give a little show of what we're thinking about when he said to Moses he said Moses said I'm not going unless you tell me who who you are said you've told me that you're the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob or maybe Joseph is earth God which way it goes but anything he says Moses said I know them I've heard it about it you've talked to me about it along the way and in my journey and thanks but said I'm not going to you give me something right now what did he say why did he make that statement cuz I'm wanting you to see a present tense perfect present tense here what you want to say it he said I am that I am no what did he mean I am that I am I am the God of Abraham Isaac Jacob I'm what they spoke of I'm what all of these things and says now Moses you know the story you know where you were born how you was born how your life was said then you come down to the point of trying to do what you could do and said you didn't make it but he said I want you to know now listen to the point I am that I am I am that that brought forth you as a child I am that that tried to tell you you as a leader and to do what was right I am that I am it's not double statement of eternity because there's no need of double Staton eternity I am is enough that's eternal but he said I am everything that spoke of anything in your life are your thoughts or anything you say I know of Abraham Isaac and Jacob I am that one that spoke through Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph I'm all of that from telling you if you just listen Moses everything that's ever been before I'm it I'm that so I'm that I am let's think about that the other day I said I don't think we really see that we don't see the way would double state he said I am that I am if he's referring you can just say well he's that I am he you know he's that that's fine but that doesn't get enough to me because if he's putting it all on Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph all of the patriarchs as Peter says it's written about it and all of them speaking about it and all of them coming forth in other words he's saying to Moses look I sent you to Egypt I've sent you to Egypt I brought you out of Egypt I'm that I am because remember we get to story wrong Israel never went to Egypt now listen Israel never went to Egypt in bondage they went to Egypt as conquerors that the ruler gave him the best land gave him Goshen gave him all of those things it probably took a couple of 200-300 years that they were in Egypt before they become slaves to remember he sent them to Egypt for another reason he didn't sound age of his slaves that going into Egypt get the point a lot of times Israel sinned and God sent them into countries as punishment but he never sent the children of Israel to Egypt as punishment that was not it it was to the point that they were to go down there and be the leaders and had they stayed with it they would have but they wouldn't stay with it maybe 100 200 300 years somewhere that they were actually there with the Egyptians as side by side leaving off the greatest land that could ever and they had everything they had the Goshen which was the great parts of Egypt the greatest of all and that belonged to them then they become a king that didn't know Joseph right the end they went into bondage in time he get the story so he's saying to Moses Moses I sent you to Egypt are the people god I told him says he's gonna be down there for hundred years I said I am that I am I'm the one that said all these I am the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob because I am eternal that's who I am he's eternal that's why Jesus Christ then is what the central theme of the entire Bible because who was Moses when he brother on say he said I couldn't understand how Moses could tell better we're doing time he said I found out it was Christ in Moses we see when when Moses left that burning bush he didn't leave the burning bush the bush went with him when he went to Egypt where was the bush not following him as a physical bush but there was the I am why would Pharaoh afraid of Moses my goodness he's King all he had to say cut his head off when he was afraid number one you've heard me speak about it before I believe he that was afraid to the point that he would Moses would cause an insurrection and take over but remember Pharaoh could read the hieroglyphics ever heard of the word for it you know where they wrote of the story and remember it's in the stories of the hieroglyphics that Moses would come forth and be the leader not to name Moses but they would come forth a leader a one to take them out so how far a row I'd be a little afraid of antenna I'd kind of let him just go along and kind of get along with him wouldn't you they hoping maybe he'd get up leave will see God hardened his heart and keep him from in other words he starts out a take a take them know I hear so far and do what you want to hear do what you want to there but just come on back and everything's okay then God got into the heart of a role you know all right get the point so the theme of the entire Bible is the revelation of Jesus Christ alright now when we come to the Book of Revelations and we started our study of the Book of Revelations we started off by the first three verses were he said before I do anything now to you John said before you write anything for in it I want you to know who I am and he said I am that I am I've come now to do what I said I'd do here alright John is writing and you understand what I'm getting out of keep saying it because John is writing the Bible the book of Revelation is a part of the Bible just as well as Genesis Exodus Leviticus numbers Deuteronomy Joshua resin deal now listen it's dire cause you've got to have it in there of who come from water this is area but the book of Revelation is not written about the past you've moved from a pice tense to a present tense but remember as Moses was riding the first five book he was riding in present tense right I mean is that sensible he sat down and he wrote the first five books as he was right that was present tense he may have wrote of the post and then he was ride of his own life and even his own death but then he would write of the future that you know Israel would go out with a mighty hand remember our point now that because that's kind of the life statements I was making a couple of weeks ago when as ministry that the Book of Revelations is not necessarily dealing with the past each point of it is present nobody wrote this yeah there was a lot of things before John went to patmans Paul had already become the first Church a messenger that church age was almost gone by the time but brother Branham said it this away he said they do that you know Paul was that he said but it's not necessarily what we're considering though he said it's the one who was the greatest of all the days this matter Paul was over here Paul's life and teachings is still prevalent today teaching to our hearts and lives right and it's still present tense there's your whole thing of what I've been trying to drive that when you sit down and you read the Bible you read it as a present tense and don't read it into the future tense there are things that will be future but remember the point is what is present and as the Prophet said you stay in the past like Wade was ministering here one day I remember him saying he said let's quit trying to raise up behind it quit trying to raise off Abraham Abraham lived back dark I believe it alive God I believe in an alive manifestation of God I don't care what the world says or the people of this message and how they turned against any got nothing to do with it the it's the alive word but if you'll see that it's alive right now then we're not going to get to the seventh Church age because they've got a point to holding there all right we're going to try to deal in the church ages in relation to try to see now what was our thoughts what was her thoughts of the writing of the Bible God comes down he appears to a prophet he writes the things Moses even the past for 3,000 years he writes it that's fine then he comes to present tense as Moses going to the burning bush that's where you pick up the present tense I'm trying to emphasize that you pick it up as to Moses you know standing before that burning bush and that burning bush says I am that I am now you go tell them that you go down there and you tell the children of Israel because listen he was not necessarily going to tell Pharaoh now get the point and listen his main objective was to go to Israel and get Israel to see who's sinning then they'd believe his message you've given two signs all of that but he was trying to get Israel to see he didn't matter about the Egyptians seeing who was coming down to take over that didn't matter anyway they didn't mount to a thing it was to Israel to get them to realize something was taking place right then the word should be coming alive to you that when you read the Bible it should be coming to the point that that Bible is alive it'll get it'll stop being so bored about reading is one of many mobile reports well I'm honest what about you when I read the Bible the first time I was in a Baptist Church didn't know very much background but a little bit and read well you know when I got over to out of that that sword showed me got sewing sewing sword stroke we got so one so and so it's old we gots one so and on our lighter so I was still so and so and so and so and so and so be getting so enjoy that didn't mean a thing to me right oh you shouldn't have said it because if the word is not allowed to you now are to me it doesn't mean a thing if it's not real right now I doesn't mean a thing now I ain't talking about a god of the future ain't talking about what is going to take place I'm talking about what is taking place that's been my whole goal for months is to drive at a point that we could see the Word of God is alive in the hearts of a born-again believer and if we get that and get that into our doing dinner that you won't read the Bible cause to remember and this this is the point yeah I kind of got bored reading so and so begat so and so now don't tell me you didn't now let's tell you you're lying and we'll forget all of that but all at once right in the middle of that go back and really get into that so and so begat so and so and so and so begat so and so and right in the middle of all that so and so forgot so no there'll be a pearl that will appear in the scripture it will tell something about what's taking place or has taken place or a future point so we might order so and so begat so and so all right go right in the middle of that you'll find an inserted point that's even when you read it you wonder why was it put dire you know but it's true now right okay now so then the point is what not to look back not to look forward those are wonderful things but to see what is taking place right now all right now in reading the church ages I ask you to read those ages and pay close attention to the thoughts and things that were said I'm not asking for a raise of hands I just ask you to read it now because in reading the Book of Revelations you find him speaking of price thing okay future thanks okay but the main concept of the Book of Revelations is present tense because he always says I am right chapter one one one two and three I am I am verse four five six seven eight nine ten I still own I am I am jumps over to the twelve still on I am just moving over into the bride form one lock under the son of man thing coming right down out of that right back in to speaking of his glory it's doing but now I watched this as I was reading through and I wish somebody would just cover said well brother Dale I found something you didn't read cuz I get tickle to that I don't I don't have any problem I read it I just did it didn't cross my mind but if you read the church ages all right you immediately find out that each church age begins with God telling who he is they say yeah but that was oaken relative 1 1 3 you know that was that's great that was wonderful but now each church age so it's not going to be a pie stand a prayer and a future tense if he says I am chapter 1 you know chapter 1 verse 1 through 3 he says I am then he says I am the Keystone saying I am I am I am he never stops the saying of I am because that means present tense okay now listen to the point now see then each church age has about four things that each age compares together did you catch that and listen to it because it's very vital you read church age one church age to get a thought in your mind what you're looking for three four five six and seven you'll find the same thing to ever church age he says I know that works 1 through 7 he said I know that works each one of the church ages starts off by describing a part of his deity and what he is each church age has within it a rebuke or the way they're doing each church age has a message to the over comer and each age has the statement he that have to hear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the church is plural not to just one he doesn't speak to one individual age all right now as I said there the other day of trying to get you to think about it ever age inherits from the other ages so we can read one church age and it says you know I'll give you to be the you're not blot out your name one of them says we don't want that message goes to all seven ages cuz remember what the spirit saith unto the church is the message to each age will relate if you'll follow it and just read it and do do like I've done I've got it written on my Bible God telling who thing is God praising God rebuking and then God speaking to the overcomer so you don't read like that we're gonna read it so let's turn now go ahead I told him I try not to those are they were kind of down on the pole in their own today somewhere out visiting and I said well we'll try to try to just not do it so let's go I told them go to go to chapter two now let's read this and if we read all set 6-8 will read six eight cause the seventh age I'm not gonna speak anything about it I'm gonna tell you that right now we'll do it the Lord willing wins t because it has a special all right but look what it's doing okay unto the Angel of the Church of Ephesus now we're watching four things one to tell who is a descriptive form of who he is and who speaking to a praise to the people of that age and to their works and their things they're doing three it'll have a rebuke and four it will come back to a praise which is really coming back to the overcomer all right so now let's watch that let's see if we can read it until the Angel of the Church of Ephesus write these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks that's the same person of revelations one that tells you I am right all right now listen I know thy works telling who he is verse 1 now the praise I know thy works and thy labour and thy patience and then how that thou canst not by the in which are evil and thou has tried them which say they are apostles and are not and has found them liars and you're supposed to be reading the church ages with this so I'm not going to go in to try to express the thoughts of what it is you should have brought it out you know how do you try an apostle you should say I should say how do you try five well by the word you know you ought to know what the Prophet said because that's what he said you're trying by the word alright I'm just trying to get you to read something for one time in your life reads something instructive that they'll see each church age has the same thing and that's the writing of the Word of God but remember as that church age was coming forth it was present tense you move into the next one its present tense okay follow it now look look what he praised him the works and the patience and the thing and has morning have patience and for my name's sake hast laboured and has not fainted what a great praise to that age now look nevertheless here comes to rebuke I have somewhat against thee because I have left our first look it over therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent and do the first works or else I will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy candlestick out of his place except thou repent you remember what I was saying the other day most people think the book of Revelation church ages especially is written and it is to two people it's written to churches true and false but they thank God rebukes the faults and praises the truth now where's he gonna pull the candlestick out of the faults ok read some times for yourself instead of taking what somebody else and their concept thought me or anybody read it for yourself now he jumps right back look but this now has to tell hate us the deeds of the Nicolaitans which also hate that first church age the one thing you'll find as you move in the ages if you'll read it and compare them read it right there read the next reading really you'll find the praises becomes less but not what he praises them for doesn't so you got praise and then you got a review now you're right back to praise again because that was the first church age but you start falling away you don't have a lot of praise you have to be real careful to read it he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I eat over the Tree of Life which is in the midst of the paradise of God so you promise to overcomer who God is the praise to the church the rebuke comes back and reap raises and ends it with telling them what they receive as an overcomer and remember that point he had an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches plural him that overcometh I'll give to eat of the Tree of Life which is in the midst of the paradise of God every age gets that statement don't isolate it to just one age gets one statement every age in Hertz you want it let's see if I can find it huh I laid it down on my nose oh how can I overcome there's going to be some overcomers in there what they remember each church age the one preceding it in her it's all that the other ages offer huh I don't get confused in that statement listen to the statement each age inherits what the other agent Harris you're gonna inherit the Tree of Life that's the first church age you mean you're not gonna get the trip huh no I'll see you ain't thinking sensibly just think of the inheritance that comes to each age and let it keep building until it builds to this age then you'll see why we're left here I'll hold that till Thursday I'm into Wednesday all right go to second Church at age what it unto the angel church in Smyrna write these things saith the first in the lice which was dead and his life showing you who he is all right I know thy works same statement same statement the first church age in tribulation and poverty with dark rich and I know the blasphemy of them that say they are Jews and are not but are the synagogue of Satan fear none of those things he praising which thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that you may be tried and you shall have tribulation 10 days will be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a crown of life now what does he say he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches the each one if you want to back up and reread that coming down we missed a verse in there but each one gets a an announcement of who he is the Sevenfold glory of his person if you'll read that in the church age book you'll get the whole story together each one gets of glory or an explanation of the glory of God and what he is then it gets to rephrase for what they went through then it gets a rebuke for falling away then it gets right back to the end because remember what I said when I went through about three weeks trying to explain one thing that God showed the bride how perfect she was in revelations 1 through 14 13 14 before she ever come on earth he shows us already perfect to him that happen here see what and it's the angel of church of pergolas these things saith he which hath the sharp two-edged to a sharp sword with two edges who is that the Lord Jesus Christ and what I know that works same thing and where thou dwellest even where Satan's seat is see the praise and I'll hold us fast my name and I shall have not denied my faith even in those days wherein Antipas ever had pronounced it was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where Satan dwelleth but I have a few things against thee rebuke because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam who taught Balak to cast a stumbling-block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication one by the third Church ages are already picking up from a deed to a doctrine right you go through all of that I'm trying to get you to just read something and look at it look so hence there also them that hold the doctrine and a nickel lanten's me which thing I hate repent or else I'll come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth looks bad but now watch him he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the church to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna and I will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth so there's an overcomer it always starts telling who God is coming to a rebuke or a praise you can throw them backwards or forth but it'll be a praise then a rebuke then right back to tell who you are and remember ever overcomer gets the sign it ain't one age gets it and we don't get it we all wind up getting the same cuz when we get to glory talked about it last night when we get to glory it's not going to be us looking down on Luther you just oh you had was justification so we we don't have time for you we are the top echelon no he's just hidden hurts everything you and her it and you and heard everything he and hurts right cuz that's our God come on let's go to and the angel little Church in town I write these things saith the son of God who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire and his feet are like fine Bryce I did include a revelation 1 12 13 14 all right there is that statement again I know thy works these church age that statement is in each church 8 works is not works to try to save works as an expression of your salvation so it's not to just that he's praising their works that you're trying to be saved he's praising them for the life they're living under the condition they're living in come off you don't bleed go back and read the church age book and see what he says I know thy works and charity and service and faith and thy patience and thy works and the life's to be more than first now watch him crazy but watching notwithstanding I have a few things against thee rebuke because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce My servants to commit fornication and eat things sacrificed unto idols and I gave her space to repent of her fornication she repented not behold I cast her into the bed and them that commit adultery with her in the Great Tribulation except they repent I will kill her children with death and all the churches the hitting that falls fine right shall know that I am he that searches the reigns and our but unto you I say and to the rest that our entire time as many as have not this doctrine and which have not known the depths of Satan as they speak I will put upon you nor the burden coming back to a praise or telling now it comes right back to the same one he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end to him I will give power over the nation's and he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels of Potter's shall they be broken or civil as I receive of my father and I will give him the morning star he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches come on what is it and unto the Angel of the Church of Sardis write these things saith he that he that he that hath the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars I know thy works same statement that thou has the name that delivers and our dead because that's where you'd lost the name of Jesus coming in to Luther and Wesley and all of that okay go ahead we stopped on three one no comfort no that's okay because the point is what the point is on the one okay we got it man be watchful and strengthen the things which remain there ready to die for I have not found thy works perfect before God why because they had come in to the fifth and the sixth church age you got so mixed up until you couldn't tell the difference hardly and the true and the false fine but just remember Luther's justification was enough for salvation in his day so remember you're not going to lose it be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to wear I have not found thy works perfect before God remember therefore how thou has received and heard and whole face and repent if thou therefore thou shalt not watch I'll come on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon the eat watch him thou hast a few names even in sardis which have not defiled their garments praising them and I shall walk with them in white for they are worthy when they say he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches and unto the Angel of the church in Philadelphia write these things said he that is holy telling who is he that is true he that hath the key of David he that opening of no man shutteth and shutteth than no man openeth I know thy works behold I was set before thee an open door now we'll back up Wednesday to this point because this is what I want you to see he set before thee an open door that was the revelation of the deity of Jesus Christ right that was given starting back in Luthor's age to come for coming on over into Wesley and the revealing of the name of Jesus all right now because that's very wonderful to where we are but think every age gets that that's the point I want you to see every age kid I'll make them with a synagogue of Satan which say they're Jews and are not but do lie behold I'll make them to come and worship before thy feet and to know that I have loved thee because thou has kept the word of my patience although I will keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth behold I come quickly hold that face which thou has that no man take thy crown him that overcometh I will make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out and I'll write upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god which is New Jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my god and I will write upon him my new name he that half a year let him hear what the spirit at the Sun did you follow the layout each age tells who he is the Lord Jesus he says gets a praise for their work and they're doing their works because every church age all seven it has I know that works all right that was their lives they were living in that age but remember what they were living now to get a point way back up they were living present-tense there was a time when that was written when John was riding on Patmos the first church age was basically already over with starting into the second one that has nothing to do with it it's speaking of Paul and them present tense if you get it present tense you won't you won't hold so much on something of the past because you're always looking back well boy bless God look at him look at him the day we had it on the day of Pentecost we're not when that happened we had a tire we had a great thing in Azusa Street but where we're at now we just did I've always said this whether you like it or what I don't care because I speak plain and blunt you take the book of Acts come on you take the book of Acts and put it in the lady you'll see an age and see how many overcomers you got you know what I'm saying now you take the people in the book of Acts that had no hindrances and time that's why I said to start with and want to say it when you start reading if you'll look at it chapter where you read first searched second 33rd church a you get more praising for what's going on because that was what was taking place was wonderful then it started to dwindle you think Paul had trouble with the Pharisees and Sadducees and the Herodians what would he do with 969 different denominations facing it what would he do with his people of this message facing them he'd say I'm going back to Ephesus that's the place I stay because that's what I do and Lord let me go back get me away from this junk brother Branham said the very spirit that those people under the Fox a book of martyrs and the killing of the millions is the same spirit we use daily to overcome will prevail do you want to go back are where they killing the people sometimes would be easier because I can quote brother Branham to you he said those people back in those ages he they just walked right into death because it was the spirit of the age they wasn't screaming in Holland they just walked right into death the same spirit they used for that we it takes that for you and I to just overcome every day now come on come on think about life and think about how far it's gone that's what I said we'll pick up this the lady you see in church eggs we're willing wins T but think of how it's gone I think of the fifty years forty eight technically be still hear another message Anna and to think of how far this thing has went you're saying well I didn't think he'd go this way in time I'm saying I didn't think he'd get this horrible we don't have to name names there's no use of it but you know what has happened to the biggest portion of the ministries of this message the older ones especially what has happened they have turned against the message you got to admit that's right well that's brother Dale that's just their way of seeing it I didn't know we had any right to interpret the word I thought we had only the right to believe it and accept it I ain't never said nobody's gonna die and go to hell because they don't believe what brother Dale said you go tell somebody that you're our liar that's the best way to say it cuz I ain't never told nothing like that cuz I believe every individual stands before God for themselves I can't put you in the body and I can't take you out of the body right you have to do that but to realize that you can follow that church ages read it compare each church age and see the things that I spoke first telling who God is second praising the church for what they're doing and how they're putting up with all of the things third rebuking them because they do go wrong not lost they go wrong with any turns right back to tell you how much an overcomer inherits and see whether you think it's that way or not that's alright with me but to think that everything those people got back down through there the right to the Tree of Life the name written to do all of those things it's all given to you because you're the age that's the most horrible this is the worst age of all ages because there's a matter of fact if you'll read it I'll read it Wednesday you find little praise in the seventh church read if you say you find less praise and less admonishing zand things in the seventh church age you find in any age because it's come down to the end but also remember one time everything they get as an overcomer we get because it doesn't say we're waiting on them it says day without us cannot be made perfect you realized that all the ages is waiting to this age read it and see take each one of the overcomers just write it down on the side this age gets the overcomes in this age gets it overcomes in this age gets you and then read every one of them and put them to yourself no wonder brother Branham said I'd rather be here than any age right then any time he said he'd rather be here of all of the bad and all the thoughts I'd rather be here cause you see listen church for one time in life yeah you're gonna have to listen to understand for one time in my life my mind is clear because he has brought us to the word why wouldn't you want to say it like that I admit that my mind was not clear upon the doctrines of the message I admit that it wasn't clear on the things we even tried to preach into badness that's what I was telling them last night see brother Brennan said you better leave them badness alone and what's he talking about I was telling them last night you realized in the Baptist Church we were looking for the end of the world to come by 19 and 88 because Israel would be established in the nation in 48 and we could count 40 years there's people out there that knows a lot more about the Bible and you think they do and maybe fallen some of it better than we are you don't remember how muddled your mind was when you'd read something even read the Prophet and he'd say something and your mind just wasn't clear see that's what it's supposed to do this is where we're at this message is coming to change this body right number right it's coming for the change of the body we're gonna work got to work out you said well now you brought now wait a minute your mind does have something to do with it don't go along don't jump so quick don't say well my mind don't have it has something to do with it remember it's not what we overcome it's how we overcome the Prophet said and he said well can only overcome by being in Jesus Christ so then we can only have a clear mind if the mind of Christ can come into our human brain and drop down into our soul to be made alive because listen the biggest portion of the Bible's done been fulfilled there's things that will take place when we leave out of here all right I'm only interested in what's taking place right now my brother Dylan I like to talk about what's coming that's all right that's all right we talk about what's coming but remember what's coming is not here and remember Satan can impersonate it like I told him last night see Satan can impersonate you get something figured out be careful and I made the illustration I said what if a form walks into this church today and you're able enough to see it are you gonna holler and say the resurrection is already pice they're dead tomorrow among us that might not be what you're looking at it might be an impersonation Satan can impersonate everything so you say what are we gonna do what are you gonna do if it does what are you gonna do if something appears in your home and you see it to look like a person now come on let's get sensible this for another second now what is that word I know I'll miss it but what does it call heliograph how's that word where they can protect a person's image Polygram ok Polygram Holly I know it had to a sin and I wasn't looking for the P all right hologram all right Justin Franklin has about 10 churches do you know what people in those 10 churches can set down look at him not because of a video but because of projection that they can make if they can do that and project him over into another Church and he stands out looking just as real as can be don't you think Satan's gonna impersonate it we could be here too sir and here could come angels walking in it we think be careful it might be somebody projecting you well ok brother Dale now how are we gonna know or to quit and go home let you leave with that for a while and let your time how are you gonna know whether that's real or not serious question a situation that could take plunge how are you gonna know do you have the answer why don't you do what the Prophet said give it the word touch he said to do that on any thought you don't matter where it's the devil or who it is or what's taking place you you give it to word test remember in the Bible about the the way that it was described and they could come forth but if they take you to another God now what are you going to do if here comes walking in two or three people that look so real until that's amazing but even the images and the things that they can project and what if that image or person is you and call it starts talking and declares them to be the angels of the Lord that's come here to straighten you out on these doctrines that you've got because you're not believe this William Branham to be a prophet now how are you gonna argue with our stands something in front of you declaring well brother then what you gonna do I'm gonna say we don't want you in here would you mind leaving because we're following the message and we believe the message and you say you don't believe it but yet you say you're an angel of God if here's an angel the devil I know you don't believe it what are you gonna do those thanks brother tell ain't gonna happen what if they do remember what in the church ages are they tried them that said they were apostles they wouldn't play in with no gila grass or ever watch y'all words he say I can't never pronounce anything twice it ain't no that they were real coal musician what you gonna do I'm just asking a question you see why it's so vital to know what the word says right so vital to understand how serious it is about the word but oh what I think about for the new he's telling her the other day about that man I quoted it he didn't have a book but he had a book but he didn't have a drawing of brother Branham to show anything about the thing we yet he had to Daniel 70 weeks to write I say God was with him what a glorious thing to be able to see the Word of God and to follow it straight through and have a clear mind about things in God's Word are you confused about whether these two or three gods are one garter what's good something's wrong with you after you've followed the message 40 or 50 years and then you turn against it as they're doing now don't tell me that's the Holy Spirit well we got let's take let's see number 330 we've been made more than conquerors we've been named more than conquerors [Music] in this long we are you know accommodate me too every day this Jesus Christ in in you let's overcome Jesus may come knocking at your door just think about it no more than overcome no it's not like be fool think about it don't to play lives in you and I don't let it bring that's the only way we can overcomes you don't brother Dale you scared me because you talk like something could happen we've may I quote brother branham listening to another nine he said this person told him said brother branham said you scared the people talking about the Lord coming in things like that Empire phrasing it was very close he said why wasn't the bride's want to know that he's coming you mean you don't even accomplish you're not happy that the word is being unveiled what are you looking for [Music] don't no matter what you looking for it has all got to relate back to the world you're more Kocher overcoming anybody have a need the church pitches your lives [Music] we're in the last agent not another one to come the past has caught up with the present inch [Music] you can read a newspaper today and almost put it in the the process messages far too late a book that down the side of it of what's taking place [Music] that's why I say I don't care what the people of this message turned into a dud this message has brought me to Jesus Christ and a peace in my heart in my mind then I can read the Bible for myself and you know what I'm talking about go right on the side of that Bible that I'm reading from a sail is exactly where the Prophet explained it you see the print that's where the Prophet explained that that's why I'm so certain let me say what he said [Music] come on my brother Dale in that would entertain he said there'll be a new name [Music] brother branham said on questions and answers on the seals it may be known when we get there now what are you gonna come up with [Music] what I said I got what he said [Music] he said I don't know what it is you want that quote it's live [Music] he said it may be known when I get tired he said none dare Conger to try to figure it out cause you'll only get away [Music] so yet we've done everything in the book because we're human being [Music] overcomers in Islam even a Victorian house by the blood of Jesus amen and amen father we thank you for the day and we asked you to just go with us now as we go either natural meal bring us back together to hear the word this afternoon is wait ministers on to us and Lord that our hearts be open to you we love you we thank you thank you for you could have shorts these things that are in thy word in order to see that we know

things seven times in thy words you Brett you rebuked you praised how much glorious should we see it and to walk in the light of your love we love you in Jesus you dismiss anything over comers in this life we the bride we are victorious through the blood of Jesus Christ now trouble may come knocking at your door don't be afraid you know it's not like before don't you give in don't let it bring you
