[4:15] instead of his son and Abraham called
[4:19] the name of the play Jehovah Jireh
[4:23] as it is said to this day in the mouth
[4:27] of the law it shall be seen and the
[4:31] angel of the Lord called unto Abraham

[8:47] I am the pressure I am Christ the
[9:10] mystery guy reveal
[9:11] I am the feast shuttle trouble I am God
[9:14] here the simplicity I am I am I am I was
[9:22] speaking of him healthy although title
[9:24] was speed of one God even it is even in
[9:28] the message how do even in the messages
[9:31] that we pray talker what would this
[9:32] speaker of his name how do you were
[9:35] speaking of his name so we begin to look
[9:37] at these things and I begin to go on and
[9:40] look at his eye right so God wanted to
[9:42] reveal his name I want you to knows her
[9:45] God name was been revealed it was titles
[9:48] it was different manifestations of his
[9:50] name but God had a purpose in this I
[9:54] want you to know that he begins to open
[9:56] up his name he begin to get closer and
[9:59] closer to a person how they saw her with
[10:01] children lose her
[10:02] so God name had to be revealed honey so
[10:05] now we begin to look here I began as I
[10:07] look around with you - no sure I want to
[10:09] go I want to read I want to have one
[10:11] more scripture the kind of laid the
[10:13] foundation one may I will read a
[10:15] scripture out of Matthew Matthew the
[10:18] first chapter and I'm gonna begin
[10:21] reading first starting around verse 20
[10:25] down through 25 maybe a little further
[10:27] than that but right now a very faint
[10:29] memory the first chapter starting at
[10:31] verse 20 if they make a pull it out real
[10:34] quick that be the first chapter starting
[10:38] at verse 20 the st. Matthew and then we
[10:41] want to deal about here because realized
[10:42] here I would you to know that name I
[10:45] want you to know what God was doing here
[10:47] got all those titles of his name
[10:49] hillo hollo title ha way back from the
[10:52] beginning
[10:54] odo title was getting closer and closer
[10:58] to flesh honey but Canada what was meant
[11:01] Canada but Canada although became Jesus
[11:04] afternoon so we begin to realize her
[11:07] naughty little revelation at the
[11:09] beginning I would you didn't know he'll
[11:10] he's gonna god they're invisible he
[11:12] meant he met him II mean informed they
[11:14] met him in many titles playing time to
[11:16] meet him who he really us how do we go
[11:18] to name recognition thority your catcher
[11:22] so thereby we go right here because this
[11:26] is a proper girl Kojo limit this time he
[11:29] did not have a revelation to who he was
[11:31] honey he was still in the Old Testament
[11:34] looking at the Old Testament God but he
[11:37] was coming from the Old Testament
[11:38] becoming a New Testament God so he goes
[11:43] here what you say
[11:44] what would the twenty verse of a god
[11:47] yeah he says while he thought only thing
[11:51] I beep up when I jumped up to four hello
[11:53] let me uh jump down to the nineteenth
[11:56] you had the 19 verses here that very
[11:59] long yesterday that's right and Joseph
[12:03] her husband being a just man
[12:05] you know what was Joseph's problem was
[12:07] he's a better judgment not willing to
[12:09] put her to to make her a public example
[12:13] but when a boy to put her away why we go
[12:16] she what testify I got a baby and I am
[12:20] pregnant by the Holy Ghost
[12:22] Joel didn't have such a revelation how
[12:25] do you jonah thinking man this young
[12:28] girl ain't tricking me I mean she took
[12:31] no crazy I've been around for them years
[12:32] I'll get rid of this girl but if I know
[12:35] she doesn't got pregnant he by me ain't
[12:37] gonna snow huh how do you don't worry
[12:39] never what they were thinking they were
[12:40] thinking that she were pregnant it was
[12:42] not bad Joe how you know how you know
[12:45] that they thought that because when Gina
[12:46] was dead
[12:47] if you know that when Gina with that
[12:49] what did they tell you we not be born of
[12:51] fornication holiday thought that Mary
[12:53] was pregnant by a Roman soldier
[12:56] but it will let you know even Joseph
[12:58] please know that I had the same thoughts
[13:00] how he had to tell you stop because
[13:02] until revelation revealed to you you in
[13:04] the natural realm he'll be rare
[13:06] revelation if we put us in the
[13:08] supernatural how do you show we think
[13:10] natural until revelation come how did
[13:13] that one you can no man can call Jesus
[13:14] the Christ without the Holy Ghost
[13:18] hello idiot say now Olivia he gonna
[13:21] think that what we always get messed up
[13:23] baby by the way we always think it oh
[13:25] you're trying to put it together and
[13:27] we'll try to figure this message out no
[13:29] you don't need to figured out you need
[13:30] to believe and if we wish you believe it
[13:33] in God get a revelation help you but he
[13:35] got the first thing you got to do and
[13:37] get you to believe the revelation of the
[13:39] word honey so he said but while he
[13:42] thought on these things behold the angel
[13:47] of the Lord appeared unto him a person
[13:49] of illusion a person who praise God
[13:52] highly they were hit appeared unto him
[13:54] unto him in a dream and said Joseph the
[13:58] son of wool right gene that right roots
[14:03] the routing of rina David he was in the
[14:06] right route for not to take a D Mary thy
[14:10] wife it would because we were being
[14:14] friend Undertaker named Mary that way
[14:16] for that would you consider her is all
[14:18] the one hallelujah everywhere so now
[14:21] he's brain in Jogja
[14:22] her Joker was questioned he kept he said
[14:25] what was wrong
[14:26] all he had to do was look at the
[14:28] scriptures as they all had already
[14:31] prophesied a virgin will be with child
[14:33] it's easier to believe with it how it is
[14:35] easy for you to plead that I can't
[14:37] believe you're a virgin she could be
[14:38] with child
[14:39] but when they become your wife that was
[14:43] a problem coming it was reasonably
[14:46] hallelujah I can't do your back and run
[14:47] away would have been that anyway baby
[14:51] shot I believe that but you got pretty
[14:55] if they just holy go now it changes how
[14:59] do you human reasoning drop here how do
[15:01] we go here a little pickled a
[15:04] in the natural and only way to see God
[15:06] is in the supernatural Holly show
[15:08] heywhat dangled in he says him and he
[15:12] goes now watch what he do here between
[15:14] the first verse yeah and she shall bring
[15:17] forth a what and I shall call his name
[15:21] that's your call his name honey and then
[15:26] they shall be called Jesus for he shall
[15:28] save his people from their sin I want
[15:32] you to notice this right honey I don't
[15:34] care you know where brother Joel I
[15:36] believe in ji-ho that's all right
[15:38] I believe in the Casimir Holly not
[15:40] breathing mighty God I believe I will
[15:43] let you know sure God did not call Ella
[15:46] he'll he didn't I call but Canada
[15:48] he called Jesus's hey Polly changed his
[15:51] name he received a new name and it was
[15:54] Jesus hello and then he goes on to say
[15:59] and now all this was done that it might
[16:03] be fulfilled which was spoken of the
[16:08] Lord by the Prophet saying a virgin
[16:11] shall be with child the word went out
[16:14] the spoken word was smoking all he could
[16:17] not come through a sexual or denier here
[16:20] to come through the smoker so a probably
[16:22] smoked the word and he would materialize
[16:25] it around Papa see her heels coming a
[16:27] virgin shall be with child brave boy
[16:30] they saw and I shall call his name what
[16:35] did they change no they didn't change
[16:36] let me put away below and I shall call
[16:40] his name Emmanuel which he'll be
[16:42] turbulent my god above but God scattered
[16:44] her with her hallelujah st. John 1:14 to
[16:48] be revealed so they're gonna say now
[16:51] Josie boy man I bet we've seen this
[16:54] revelation boy he was he was I think I
[16:57] might be right there
[16:58] and it was so I want you to know I
[17:00] should call his name Emmanuel
[17:01] how do you Emmanuel the interpretation
[17:04] was it interpreted the name for you it
[17:06] don't change him it just brain wave or
[17:08] imposition we place it way for to me his
[17:12] name shall be called manual
[17:14] by interpretation God stand here Oh
[17:17] mother how did that is his name how did
[17:20] Jesus in other word you said brother Joe
[17:22] why you're teaching on it
[17:23] I'm going to tell what made me got on
[17:24] the subject but the team was in Africa
[17:28] some time back in a certain point and he
[17:33] was dating a baptism surgeon took place
[17:35] and why he was dead they say i baptize
[17:39] you in the name of the lord will
[17:43] branding that is adultery teaching
[17:47] powell's that i didn't die for your sins
[17:49] Oh Paula Deen devil you're seeing Jesus
[17:52] Christ someone died for your sin and you
[17:55] must get a revelation
[17:56] I want public don't look at me but look
[17:58] - Gina natok didn't to finish your your
[18:01] face he'll lose hope now we begin to
[18:04] look at this day right so I thought that
[18:06] what got me stirred up about this so now
[18:08] we begin to look at his name how we want
[18:10] to deal with the name of it how long
[18:12] would you read a quote for Christ a
[18:14] mystery God revealed he says here at
[18:17] page 23
[18:19] he said because he had to experience see
[18:24] he was a savior he had to express that
[18:28] and he how could he do it only through
[18:33] Christ how could he be a certain only
[18:36] through Christ how could he be a Hiller
[18:38] only through Christ see all day they'd
[18:40] wind up in that one person Jesus crying
[18:44] not people call he said that one
[18:47] approach that people call Jesus a genie
[18:49] they don't get an idea because his name
[18:52] and rebuilding the Thunder which is the
[18:54] divine mission that lays in his word his
[18:57] name is just a one his name is a
[18:59] character and a person with Jesus Christ
[19:03] I'm gonna let you notice here when when
[19:05] he opened up the revelation to Joseph
[19:07] Holly what didn't new he broke me he
[19:09] broke the supernatural mystery he
[19:11] reveals something that was supernatural
[19:13] it had never been done before he broke
[19:16] the seals to Joseph Palomino it was
[19:19] sealed in Georgia he rented in Isaiah he
[19:22] know what I said but he could not see
[19:25] the mystery until God
[19:26] in the water you cannot see Christ into
[19:29] God interpreter word highly people I
[19:32] don't get you said brother how would I
[19:33] know he's here
[19:35] Holly you'll know him here you would
[19:37] know he's her by the revelation of his
[19:39] worry dude
[19:42] I mean take this here literally look at
[19:44] this Lacan says so now we begin to go to
[19:46] here so now brother who what you trying
[19:48] to do what it is today I say today what
[19:51] we have done in the message I begin to
[19:53] rely we have got people set a message
[19:56] but we haven't got them to Christ and
[19:59] you know we don't actually you believe
[20:00] Jesus we say do you believe the message
[20:02] how do you they don't even got a
[20:04] revelation would a message else hey will
[20:06] you say - do you beat imagine first day
[20:08] they say y'all believe brother Brantley
[20:09] but brother burn and believe Jesus how
[20:12] can brother Eddie say believe me if they
[20:14] believe him I need like the people get
[20:16] over how when you think of the message
[20:17] first thing you think about
[20:19] I believe the Prophet hug that's good
[20:21] you breathing but do you believe his
[20:22] message who you believe in The Guardian

[23:29] to deal with something that Jesus say at
[23:31] one time you know Jesus with his
[23:33] disciples and he says these words to him
[23:37] he says they will rejoice it because
[23:43] they had power over demons now I be that

[23:53] Rajasa t because we know who we are have
[23:56] when you know who you are you you know

[26:17] spirit and falling in the chapter that

[38:06] back up let God come in one time you put
[38:09] it down are you free I don't even know
[38:13] where that comes from never name notes
[38:14] hey Lisa
[38:16] but look here then they live to deal
[38:18] with this religious spirit what just
[38:21] what this rich young ruler
[38:23] perfect tight cuz he had ever good work
[38:29] that was required for a person that's
[38:32] under the law
[38:35] yes that's it if he would have died
[38:39] before he met Jesus he was on his way to
[38:42] him he was on his way to heaven come for
[38:46] his human knowledge when he did
[38:49] everything that he thought was right he
[38:53] did he really did what he said when
[38:55] Jesus actually request me he went just
[38:56] telling a lie he's had done anything
[38:59] from my youth right so he would really
[39:01] be an unassisted call he thought in his
[39:03] heart man my slate is clean so he came
[39:07] to Jesus and here you're just talking to
[39:10] Jesus and he says he says good master
[39:14] what can I do didn't hurt in her eternal
[39:17] life and first I'll he comes good Jesus
[39:19] said there's none good but the father
[39:20] you said what Jesus didn't have no sin
[39:22] yet but he returned you're saying you're
[39:25] seeing once again it was that don't you
[39:27] worry I don't care you're seeing today
[39:28] okay you're seeing to the death okay
[39:31] your sins the hell not my sin your sins
[39:34] so he point him back to the revelation
[39:37] if there's none good but the father then
[39:40] he goes on and says what can I do
[39:42] all right we got one question here
[39:44] that's what's wrong today everybody
[39:46] think I'm gonna do something good enough
[39:48] to make heaven hey hey but you don't
[39:51] know how many times I say God I don't
[39:53] care about that
[39:54] God is not concerned about how much you
[39:56] do well look what we done done live here
[39:58] helllooo dealt with the church a bit
[39:59] people said true well I'll be able to do
[40:01] surgery here I done done this and I've
[40:03] been doing that so what you know get
[40:05] brownie points with God this is not a
[40:11] contract this is salvation maybe give me
[40:14] of God if you do this I do that no you
[40:17] don't do that with God you submit
[40:19] yourself and let God take over but he
[40:23] says what can I do it in her to eternal
[40:25] life Jesus all right
[40:26] simple just keep the commandments I
[40:33] should not steal gosh it's not like that
[40:35] I have no Word of God
[40:36] - should not you know it so the young
[40:39] man he he immediately went through his
[40:41] spiritual computer thinking and I turned
[40:45] all that all my life
[40:47] I'm gonna be a pretty good fella maybe
[40:50] would you say I've done it for my I was
[40:52] raising the message like my daddy was in
[40:55] Moses revival you know how to use her my
[41:01] mammy you don't know my
[41:03] great-grandfather was with Moses did he
[41:06] tell you your great-grandfather see
[41:07] everyone with Moses he never crossed
[41:09] over honey when they come out of your
[41:12] nose when they come over in the Promised
[41:14] Land
[41:15] Holly they come in the New Testament
[41:16] they never quoted Joshua they called
[41:20] Abraham and they caught him oh they were
[41:22] still under law Joshua get him over and
[41:25] position a place them in the word so you
[41:30] go to says here Jesus a where all right
[41:33] you say you kept all the commandments so
[41:36] if you kept all the commandments then I
[41:38] don't need to die for the world cuz
[41:40] you're perfect in other words if I'm
[41:43] with in that way if you kept all the
[41:45] commandments I don't need to die you
[41:46] already perfect how do you know why do
[41:48] you need a sacrifice you can do it on
[41:50] your left honey but he said well I will
[41:52] let you know right now I'm unconsciously
[41:55] to you or your son aren't you
[41:57] you're on a world that you about a
[41:59] religious devil oh brother you should
[42:04] know Jesus a huh you want to be set free
[42:07] I'm gonna tell when I deliver you from
[42:09] that demon that got you about that
[42:13] brother damn day they say I'm more
[42:15] sensitive nerve in a man like that
[42:17] wallet it might not look like you but it
[42:23] was a problem that God Jesus can see his
[42:25] love for his wallet for his chain for
[42:29] eternal life what will a man give were
[42:31] so hallelujah hey Jesus say all right
[42:34] you think if you want eternal life take
[42:37] your wallet give it to the poor he said
[42:41] man you out of your mind
[42:42] I'm giving man well how could he say
[42:45] kept all the commandments when he got
[42:47] something he loved more than her life
[42:49] halu so it showed up that was in him he
[42:52] was about he wouldn't have never been
[42:54] lost if he wouldn't have never come
[42:56] across and you wouldn't never be lost
[42:58] and we wouldn't have had a row
[43:00] elation to come to introduce us back to
[43:02] Jesus and we said I don't want to go
[43:04] there trying to bleed it so it so got
[43:08] the messenger do this run over your
[43:10] preacher perusing Deborah no it ain't
[43:12] about man hey buddy Superman raise up
[43:17] it's over wit
[43:19] it's you in Christ now no Superman is
[43:22] Christ
[43:25] so would you know him so he rejected
[43:28] Jesus and probably gone the only way he
[43:31] could be saying it through Jesus because
[43:34] Noah he was sick the same man from that
[43:38] sickness that was the purpose
[43:42] we don't forgot what their purpose was
[43:44] heli everything else if we look at so
[43:46] revelaed we forgot why did Jesus come
[43:48] why do we call him the name of Jesus
[43:51] because he's the only way if you could
[43:53] believe and confess with your mouth and
[43:55] believe in your heart that should be
[43:59] saying you know what a name they can do
[44:01] that but Jesus came hello so now we look
[44:05] at me do things right here I'm just
[44:06] gonna do it I'm gonna throw a few other
[44:08] things in here prepares you I want you
[44:11] to notice here I'm gonna lay because
[44:13] probably guy use this inch if you won't
[44:15] think of preaching something either out
[44:17] of the wall go back and look at a god
[44:20] prevent God chosen place of worship he
[44:22] lays it out hallelujah I'm listening no
[44:25] way down here he said who's first
[44:28] Colossians 3:17 I'll just read you
[44:30] regret which ever whatsoever ye do in
[44:32] word or deed do it all in the name of
[44:35] the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and
[44:37] the Father by him
[44:39] hallelujah Network who serves you did I
[44:41] read Romans I just quoted Romans 10
[44:43] brother the 13th I wish ever call upon
[44:46] the name I call upon the name of the
[44:48] Lord shall be saved
[44:49] how shall they call without a tape
[44:54] recorder
[44:58] and one thing about you said well I
[45:00] brought you a table called here
[45:01] preaching yeah but they don't got feets
[45:06] it don't got feet so don't try to use it
[45:09] on me how do you learn well sure in the
[45:12] word Sunday you know why did Paul killed
[45:14] him when he come up when he come up did
[45:17] a book evident had you received or they
[45:20] go sis do you believe here they was
[45:24] heaven Church without the Holy Ghost
[45:26] here people been in the midst we got the
[45:28] whole ego they still falling in adultery
[45:30] still going out doing things in the
[45:32] world and they say I've been in the
[45:33] middle for thirty years you never got
[45:34] sealed because if you get the person of
[45:38] Jesus which is the revelation that is
[45:40] meted you will become a new creation go
[45:43] insane any man in Christ is a new
[45:45] creation old things have passed away and
[45:49] all things become new you say you're
[45:53] trying to make it an uber from get ready
[45:55] tell you in the scripture in the message
[45:56] I will use your new birth but it says
[45:58] here and they say we have not received
[46:01] he that we know not he did he say we
[46:04] know not that be a Holy Ghost and then
[46:05] then what did he tell him they had to do
[46:07] what the Bible said in it they could not
[46:10] receive the Holy Ghost until they
[46:11] receive the revelation of his name and
[46:14] go get baptized lay hands on the body
[46:18] and all of a sudden it was filled with
[46:20] the Holy Ghost people this is revelation
[46:23] is more than just a book the Bible is no
[46:27] good without the person being it that
[46:29] says you see the person in the Bible you
[46:31] got letters but when the Bible become a
[46:33] new book you see Christ in you how do so
[46:36] now I'm gonna use just from here I think
[46:40] just I'm gonna just maybe kind of
[46:41] winding this from kind of like a closing
[46:43] but I mean like I say the new birth I
[46:45] need to eat that real good I need to hit
[46:48] that real good because people thinking
[46:49] I'm getting born again just because I I
[46:52] got a message book in my hand I got a
[46:55] tape in my house that's good we should
[46:58] play the tapes we should heard a message
[46:59] but we also need to ask God by
[47:02] revelation the givers over experience
[47:04] with the baptism of the holy gold which
[47:06] is the person
[47:08] described in you so I could take out the
[47:12] thrill of being lost you know there's
[47:17] one thing we all battle with it's not
[47:19] gonna be good enough when Arabica I
[47:20] doubt it
[47:22] I doubt it very serious but the person
[47:25] that's in you is good enough
[47:26] honey the person to see you if I you
[47:29] know you did me because you heard a
[47:30] night in church it's a lot of pleasure

[52:38] I'm trying to say people this revelation
[52:40] is not given by my knowledge you got
[52:43] it's given by the person you know that
[52:46] nobody can't separate you from it I'll
[52:48] be in other words something that's in

[52:54] planted by the rivers of water I shall
[52:56] not be moved he like me in a tree or
[52:59] rock but it planted the right way in
[53:01] angle move so there was something to get
[53:05] let me finish the power I didn't we
[53:06] dispersed you don't Evelyn but up all
[53:09] your Paul and Judas now watch Judas why
[53:13] did Judas go to hell he had a rich my
[53:16] better life than Paul cuz he was on a
[53:19] more powerful influence in Paul Paul was
[53:22] under the in the way Judas was with
[53:24] Jesus and why didn't you to sell Jesus
[53:27] out for politics for religious power and
[53:31] money why did Paul crucify the church
[53:34] you know why Paul Cruz my judge he was
[53:37] still under the law he would do what the
[53:40] law required him to do so what he was
[53:43] he was doing it and he would believe it
[53:46] in his heart that I am doing and they
[53:48] blasphemers against Moses message I'm
[53:50] getting rid of that what he would do he
[53:54] was under the law so he'll go judas
[53:57] under grace following the messenger hell
[54:01] and he's selling out he'll go Paul under
[54:04] the world I'm in a religious spirit of
[54:07] the law had never met Jesus so what he
[54:12] doing the what he done he disqualified
[54:15] himself from the scripture everybody
[54:18] he he hated the church he hated the name
[54:21] of Jesus because he didn't believe in
[54:22] the name of Jesus he believed in the
[54:24] Lord guy he believed in G over he know
[54:26] although titles he believed in no titles
[54:29] of the Old Testament
[54:30] Holly show here he was he goes he'll go
[54:33] he'll go poke believing it so he hated
[54:35] the name of Jesus he was going into
[54:39] myself to get a warrant if I can't
[54:42] anybody baptize it or preaching in that
[54:45] name I'm killing him if I don't kill him
[54:47] I'm putting him in jail I don't care if
[54:49] it's a woman boy girl that's how much he
[54:52] hated the Jesus and then he not only did
[54:57] he do that he turns around and he kills
[55:01] a man that's full of the Holy Ghost
[55:04] which according to my Bible say Chuck
[55:07] not minority do my prophets no harm it's
[55:11] better for meals star to be tied around
[55:13] your neck and you up thrown into the
[55:15] depth of the sea and you touch one of
[55:17] mine or the one he killed a man full of
[55:19] the Holy go totally disqualified himself
[55:21] he said I passing they don't look good
[55:28] one but if he would have stayed on the
[55:31] Lord wouldn't have been good but as he
[55:33] was on his way down to Damascus
[55:35] Hollywood that demon I'll hate the demon
[55:38] or legalism how do I want to persecute
[55:40] that lead at Church of God how do you
[55:42] know where he was he had made up in my
[55:44] soul he was gay he was going on his Road

[55:49] light come around Paul Paul being a
[55:52] student of the scripture and knowing
[55:54] what the pill of our he
