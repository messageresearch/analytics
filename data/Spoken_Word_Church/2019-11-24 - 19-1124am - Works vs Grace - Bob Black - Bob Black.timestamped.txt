[0:02] hello everybody out there on the
[0:04] Internet god bless you thanks you can
[0:07] see windy again this morning and and of
[0:11] course welcome the brother/sister
[0:12] handers brother wait you missed it you
[0:18] missed out well you know wait um so I I
[0:24] put together just some slides on um I
[0:26] just to kind of compare and go through
[0:28] the few scriptures and clothes on law
[0:31] and grace you know you have to you talk
[0:34] to the young people about things that
[0:36] they're dealing with everything you kind
[0:37] of get you into the mindset of you know
[0:40] overcoming and I just to kind of give
[0:42] you an overview of what I want to talk
[0:44] about is that is that law was given to
[0:46] kind of expose our to to bring us to a
[0:49] God consciousness that God is observing
[0:52] us and to make us aware the the things
[0:55] that of the defects in our life and to
[1:00] make you aware that you need something
[1:02] because when you look into the mirror of
[1:04] God's Word and you begin to see that
[1:06] there's there there are defects in your
[1:08] life that you need God that there's
[1:10] something that there's lacking in your
[1:12] life then you begin to cry out for God
[1:15] and to look into his word for remedy and
[1:17] you need something you can't and there's
[1:21] no there's no satisfaction to the law
[1:23] and anything that you can do but what we
[1:26] the the only the only satisfaction for
[1:29] the law is the righteousness of God that
[1:32] he applies to us but by grace and he
[1:35] gives his grace to us based on just
[1:37] based upon our said I just I simply
[1:39] believing in him so when we believe on
[1:42] him he applies his grace to us and His
[1:44] grace works in us gives us the power to
[1:48] overcome the things of the world so
[1:51] really that's what kind of wanted to
[1:52] look at the two things that long versus
[1:54] Gration law the law was given there's a
[1:57] purpose to the law to take to bring us
[2:00] to a consciousness that there's
[2:01] something lacking in us but then we need
[2:04] the grace of God to meet the requirement
[2:06] of the law it's what God did for us
[2:09] needs to requirement he paid the price
[2:11] on the cross so that we wouldn't have to
[2:12] die we wouldn't have to there's no way
[2:14] for us to meet the requirement of the
[2:16] law he made it for us yes and when we
[2:19] when we believe on the atonement that he
[2:22] made for us and and and the purchased
[2:24] the purchased possession the purchase
[2:27] price the price being paid then he is he
[2:30] meets the requirement he has already met
[2:32] the requirement of the law so you know a
[2:37] lot of new Christians they begin when
[2:39] they begin to come to church everything
[2:41] and and and you know I think it's good
[2:43] to kind of kind of refresh on our memory
[2:45] of these kind of basic principles
[2:46] because you know you get sometimes you
[2:50] can get so down deep into the into the
[2:53] deep things of the word and everything
[2:54] and you forget that we're not saved by
[2:58] the things that we do we're not saved by
[3:01] the work trying to work something up
[3:03] within ourselves and that's what in the
[3:06] book of Romans chapter 3 and the whole
[3:09] book of Galatians that more Luther just
[3:11] said they spent this whole life we're
[3:13] really looking at the book of Galatians
[3:15] because the book of Galatians keeps
[3:17] reminding you the urine saved because
[3:19] that you do because of the things that
[3:22] you do because you have kept yourself
[3:24] from this from that or because you've
[3:26] made yourself holy because of the of
[3:28] your works but you know new Christians
[3:31] and and so for you if you kind of use
[3:33] you start your Christian journey with
[3:34] legalism you look to see like a lot of a
[3:37] lot of the questions that young people
[3:38] asked if they use Bible studies is that
[3:40] okay for me to do this is there okay for
[3:42] me to listen to this kind of music is it
[3:43] okay for me to listen to to do this kind
[3:46] of thing or whatever is it okay and
[3:47] you're looking at it from a barrier a
[3:49] legalist do's and don'ts that kind of
[3:51] thing but the the message the gospel is
[3:55] not do's and don'ts it's belief in
[3:58] Christ and he will do it for you move he
[4:00] will work he will give you overcoming
[4:02] power so that the faith that believing
[4:06] in him works outward within you and
[4:08] takes possession of your flesh saying
[4:12] Romans chapter 3 verses 9 to 10 and I
[4:15] know
[4:16] we're trying to keep the sunny lesson in
[4:19] just 30 minutes so I'm not going to go
[4:21] on for too long but we'll just kind of
[4:23] cover some basics and Romans chapter 3
[4:26] says what then are we better than they
[4:28] know and Noah's he's talking about the
[4:30] comparison between Jews and Gentiles the
[4:32] Jews better than Gentiles because Jews
[4:34] keep keep the law I have the law all
[4:37] these kind of things no one knows for we
[4:40] have before proved both Jews and
[4:42] Gentiles that they are all under sin as
[4:45] it as it is written there is none
[4:46] righteous no not one
[4:48] there's nobody righteous by themselves
[4:51] by the just because they have come from
[4:54] particular genealogy or because they do
[4:56] particular work protocols in this case
[4:59] he's talking about circumcision because
[5:00] a Jew is circumcision circumcised that
[5:02] it doesn't make them
[5:04] there's no righteousness in your works
[5:06] in the things that you do now we know
[5:11] that one thing in Romans chapter 3
[5:12] verses 19 to 20 continuing oh he says
[5:15] now we know that what things soever the
[5:17] law saith is safe to them who are under
[5:19] the law that every mouth may be stopped
[5:21] and see this is where you get into the
[5:23] purpose of the law the purpose of the
[5:25] law oh thank you man
[5:33] we have that same problem last time I
[5:35] forgot our victim
[6:04] now we know that what things soever the
[6:06] law say it's made to the improver under
[6:08] the law that every mouth may be stopped
[6:10] and all the world may become guilty
[6:12] before God
[6:13] there's the purpose of the law
[6:15] everybody's guilty and then extending
[6:18] suppose as your business and you know
[6:20] you begin to talk to some people in
[6:22] there and they think that when they when
[6:24] they become confronted with Christianity
[6:26] or the gospel a lot of times the
[6:28] reaction is the things that I'm doing
[6:30] are there's nothing wrong with it
[6:32] there's nothing why why is it wrong for
[6:35] me to drink alcohol or smoke a cigarette
[6:38] or smoke a cigar I a lot of times you
[6:40] know people they'll say well life is
[6:43] hard
[6:43] I need a little something that kind of
[6:45] help time you know I'm serious listen
[6:47] these are actual natural responses to
[6:50] things that I've talked to people about
[6:52] well why why should I not get a little
[6:55] bit of enjoyment in the way that I that
[6:59] be something you know like you hear
[7:01] people they they work all day and they
[7:03] go home and drink a beer and and fall
[7:05] asleep on the sofa and get up and do it
[7:06] all over again
[7:07] and and because life is hard and
[7:09] everything there's there's things
[7:10] they're trying to satisfy that thirst
[7:13] they get them with a little bit of
[7:14] alcohol when I smoking a cigar or
[7:16] something but see the law was given to
[7:19] make you guilty when you come to church
[7:21] the the mirror of God's Word exposes
[7:23] there's something else that you should
[7:25] be thirsting for and yeah you're
[7:27] satisfying your flesh with all these
[7:30] lustful cravings and all these different
[7:31] kind of things but there's something
[7:33] else that's that's you were really made
[7:35] to thirst after and so you begin to
[7:38] realize that there's a defect therefore
[7:41] by the deeds of the law there shall no
[7:42] flesh be justified in this site for by
[7:45] the law is the knowledge of sin the law
[7:47] gives you knowledge that you're doing
[7:49] home and that's what my contention is
[7:52] the law though all should be preached it
[7:54] but it's going to be preached with grace
[7:56] you know if you don't preach the law and
[7:58] how does anybody know that they're
[8:00] singing you got
[8:02] you gotta preach it so that people know
[8:03] that there's something wrong in their
[8:04] lives but if you try to satisfy if you
[8:07] try to justify yourself by saying well
[8:09] well just within myself I'm gonna go to
[8:11] Alcoholics Anonymous and stop drinking
[8:13] or I'm gonna just try I'm gonna try
[8:16] within myself to put aside these things
[8:18] the government that the devil has me
[8:21] burdened with Europe you're very
[8:23] unlikely to succeed sanctification
[8:28] exactly because I can't step of
[8:31] sanctification
[8:32] it's that legalistic state if a man
[8:36] brother that's right yeah this is very
[8:39] dangerous to community goes you're
[8:44] you're in that legalistic stadium but
[8:46] you don't have the whole thing goes
[8:48] right yes sir
[8:51] that's why Anna's eqo chapter 16 the
[8:56] Bible says that I will establish my
[8:58] covenant with thee and thou shall know
[8:59] that I am the Lord that thou may ask
[9:01] remember and be confounded and never
[9:04] open our mouths anymore because of thy
[9:06] shame when I'm pacified toward thee of
[9:08] all that thou hast done said the Lord
[9:09] and other works when the when you become
[9:11] confronted with the word you realize
[9:15] your mouth is closed to any kind of why
[9:18] I didn't do nothing wrong there's no sin
[9:20] there's no sin in me the Bible says that
[9:22] anybody says I don't see him is a lie
[9:24] because they everybody isn't guilty
[9:27] before God and that's what the law does
[9:29] but now the righteousness of God without
[9:32] the law is manifested in Romans chapter
[9:34] 3 verse 21 the righteousness of God
[9:36] without the law some something something
[9:40] beyond the law something greater than
[9:42] the law comes on the scene where you've
[9:43] been to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[9:45] and he gives you his righteousness the
[9:48] righteousness without you trying to do
[9:51] something of your own self the
[9:52] righteousness of God without the law is
[9:54] manifested being witnessed by the law
[9:56] and the prophets even the righteousness
[9:58] of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ
[10:01] unto all and upon all them that believe
[10:03] for there is no difference for all have
[10:06] sinned and come short of the glory of
[10:08] God being justified freely by His grace
[10:11] through the redemption that is in Christ
[10:13] Jesus now grace grace is something that
[10:17] you don't do anything for you can't do
[10:19] you can't do anything to Mary grace you
[10:22] don't you don't it's not like saying if
[10:25] I if I can if I can just be a good
[10:28] enough person then I'll get enough grace
[10:30] to allow me to overcome you know the
[10:33] only thing that you have to do is
[10:35] believe and you know we keep we keep
[10:38] harping on faith faith is your
[10:41] revelation and it comes by hearing the
[10:43] word so that's why we've got to come to
[10:45] church we've got to study study the
[10:47] Bible and hid in the atmosphere because
[10:50] II the word is what will give us faith
[10:52] to overcome it gives us faith to believe
[10:55] what God has done for us to accept what
[10:58] he's done for us to accept the grace
[11:00] that he's given to us and grace is God's
[11:04] gift to us to overcome the flesh things
[11:06] of this world the things of your carnal
[11:09] nature all of those kind of things so it
[11:12] is really almost difficult to preach law
[11:16] and grace because on the one hand you've
[11:19] got to preach law in a way that exposes
[11:21] the carnality of our our our nature and
[11:25] all those things but but yet you we've
[11:29] got to preach it also in a way that
[11:31] gives people a hope that you can't
[11:34] overcome yeah you know you we're not
[11:36] supposed to be just kind of you know
[11:40] accepting of the situation that we're in
[11:43] sometimes it seems like it's preached
[11:45] that it doesn't really matter what you
[11:48] do it doesn't really matter the
[11:51] condition that you're living in just go
[11:53] ahead and smoke those cigars and all
[11:54] those kind of things but that's not true
[11:56] either it's not a greasy grace right
[11:59] yeah we're not we're not living the kind
[12:00] of gospel will you just do whatever you
[12:03] see but when you accept the grace of God
[12:05] it will produce a change in your life it
[12:08] will give you overcoming power
[12:11] regulations
[12:13] the law was the schoolmaster to bring us
[12:17] to Christ exactly that's why I lose my
[12:25] love no no that's that's actually that
[12:27] that's right along with what I'm gonna
[12:29] be talking about how I was gonna get to
[12:31] how Martin Luther just loved the book of
[12:33] Galatians that he actually wrote right
[12:35] when it is I forget the name of it but
[12:37] that big that big book he wrote that
[12:41] summarized all the deep teachings and
[12:43] Galatians which is really about you
[12:46] can't be saved by your own words so
[12:50] let's look at some things that that um
[12:52] brother Brown said he said look at it in
[12:55] the world today where all this is I'm
[12:57] rises up watch on all the cults of non
[13:00] mediating and a legalistic I got to do
[13:03] so and so if I don't speak with tongues
[13:05] if I don't do this if I don't shout if I
[13:07] don't dance there's something wrong with
[13:10] me that's legal if we are saved by grace
[13:13] through faith ez7 Jehovah Jireh then he
[13:19] takin yeah
[13:20] but now we find out after this
[13:22] dispensation then it lasted on that
[13:23] legalistic Sat dispensation until a real
[13:26] royal seat come then he taken all the
[13:29] legalism upon himself because he did all
[13:33] the things that we could not need he
[13:36] paid the price
[13:37] all the works he did and paid the price
[13:41] of redemption in God's church is back in
[13:44] grace again not under the law and
[13:46] legalism it's under grace and the
[13:49] promise of God the true seed of Abraham
[13:51] he taken the law upon himself and the
[13:55] law nailed him to the cross of what we
[13:58] must do and must not
[14:00] and must do and must not do it that that
[14:03] is Liberty to the church that you're not
[14:06] you don't have to go like the Catholics
[14:08] push the penny down the string with your
[14:09] nose and do all of the different novenas
[14:11] and fanaticism and stuff you don't have
[14:13] to do all of these things to be saved
[14:16] it's just believe it on the Lord Jesus
[14:17] Christ now what would we say today you
[14:20] got to quit smoking you got to quit
[14:22] drinking you got to quit doing this that
[14:23] wasn't what he asked he said what must I
[14:25] do to be saved
[14:26] and Paul told him say you don't have to
[14:29] do anything what what I do believe all
[14:33] the Lord Jesus Christ believe on the
[14:35] Lord Jesus Christ not coming through on
[14:37] our congregation and standing before the
[14:39] church and say this and most frankly you
[14:41] immerse you or whatever you want to do
[14:42] our way and if you're not and I Church
[14:44] then that wasn't it he said just believe
[14:46] on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou and
[14:50] thy house shall be saved
[14:53] now when when Jesus will be preaching he
[14:56] would preach he was preaching to people
[14:58] that were very legalistic that's
[15:00] actually what the Nate that term
[15:02] pharisaical means if you look at what
[15:05] the definition is it fair signal like
[15:07] the Pharisees fair sétimo means
[15:10] practicing or advocating strict
[15:12] observance of external external forms
[15:15] and ceremonies of religion or conduct
[15:17] without regard to the spirit it means
[15:19] that you're self righteous are
[15:21] hypocritical in other words you're
[15:23] trying to put on an outward appearance
[15:25] of you know like the Pharisees what I
[15:28] pay tithes I do all of these things and
[15:30] and then on the inside like Jesus said
[15:33] they're like whitewashed tombs they
[15:34] painted the tomb white on the outside
[15:36] but on the inside it's not changed it's
[15:40] not too expensive the the grace of God
[15:43] must proceed from an inner work that he
[15:45] moves outward to to change you hourly
[15:47] again so that you can bear fruit it's
[15:50] got to start from the inside so ferry
[15:52] Seco was a legalistic form where they're
[15:55] trying to trying to work out
[15:57] righteousness by the things that they do
[15:59] and that's that's contrary to the gospel
[16:02] the gospel gives you liberty where you
[16:04] don't have to do all these
[16:05] I can this is a little story in Luke
[16:09] chapter 18 work it says two men went up
[16:11] into the temple and pray the Warner
[16:14] Pharisee and the other Republican the
[16:17] Pharisee stood and prayed thus with
[16:19] himself god I thank thee that I am not
[16:21] as other men are and he's looking at it
[16:24] from a legalistic standpoint I don't do
[16:26] like everybody else my works are
[16:29] different than these other people
[16:30] these extortioners unjust adulterers or
[16:34] even as this publican and it began to
[16:38] look down and you know I wonder
[16:40] sometimes we if you will examine
[16:42] ourselves sometimes we ourselves can get
[16:45] into this mindset that I'm better than
[16:47] other people because I do I do I don't
[16:50] do what they're doing or or you make it
[16:54] you make your salvation about works I
[16:56] fast twice in the week which is good but
[17:00] you're not saved by that look at me I
[17:03] fast twice in the week I wonder if this
[17:05] publican even does as much as that I've
[17:07] yet I give tithes of all that I possess
[17:10] my goodness what that's that's great
[17:13] that's good but that's not how you're
[17:16] saved
[17:17] because you paid the parking lot or you
[17:19] paint the territory
[17:21] I had a breaker to the to the to the
[17:23] building fund or whatever and your
[17:26] publican standing afar off would not
[17:28] lift up so much as his eyes in the
[17:30] heaven and in other words he's not
[17:32] looking at it from a works perspective
[17:34] he's crying out for grace I know I'm a
[17:37] sinner but smote upon his breast saying
[17:40] God be merciful to me a sinner I tell
[17:44] you this man went down to his house
[17:45] justified rather than the other for
[17:47] everyone that exalteth himself shall be
[17:50] abased and he that homeless itself shall
[17:53] be exalted do you see if you want to get
[17:56] anything from God you come by faith not
[17:59] based upon anything that you can do it
[18:03] you won that one in this situation came
[18:06] to God with all this truckload of works
[18:08] and the other came with nothing there's
[18:11] nothing good in me and he was just
[18:13] crying out for mercy because Galatians
[18:17] chapter 3 there's Galatians for as many
[18:20] as are of the works of the law are under
[18:22] the curse for it is written cursed is
[18:25] every one that continueth not in all
[18:28] things which are written in the book of
[18:29] the law to do them but that no man is
[18:32] justified by the law in the sight of God
[18:34] it is evident for the just shall live by
[18:37] faith
[18:38] that's why Martin Luther just loved the
[18:41] book of Galatians he said this next
[18:44] slide the Epistle to the Galatians is my
[18:47] own epistle I have petrale myself to it
[18:50] it is my kv-1 boy kt1 boy was that none
[18:53] that Martin Luther married and and he
[18:56] called the book of Galatians his Katie
[18:58] because because it's Satan you can't
[19:03] meet if you're trying to meet the
[19:06] requirements of the law there's some
[19:08] little things somewhere that you'll slip
[19:10] that's why we don't judge one another we
[19:12] don't point fingers at one another
[19:13] because if you judge to the other
[19:14] there's some aspect of that that using
[19:16] yourself forgives you
[19:18] do you know a lot of times preachers
[19:19] will get up and you either you know talk
[19:21] about things that you're not so you're
[19:23] not supposed to ever work on Sunday and
[19:24] then you slip up and and for long your
[19:27] work calls you in and you're working on
[19:29] Sunday or something
[19:30] there's no aspect of the law that by
[19:33] yourself
[19:34] you can keep but God kept gone it has
[19:37] kept the that entire all the
[19:39] requirements of the law so when you
[19:41] believe on Him he is satisfied you're
[19:44] justified by your face not by your works
[19:47] in Galatians chapter 2 verse 16 knowing
[19:52] that a man is not justified by the works
[19:54] of the law but by the faith of Jesus
[19:56] Christ even we have believed in Jesus
[19:59] Christ that we might be justified by the
[20:01] faith of Christ and not by the works of
[20:04] the law for by the works of the law
[20:06] shall no flesh be justified and and you
[20:10] know that and that statement you could
[20:12] get
[20:12] you can get really deep because we're
[20:15] trying to grow into a place where our
[20:18] flesh will be changed this body will be
[20:21] changed so if you want to grow to a
[20:23] depth of understanding to wit the
[20:25] adoption to understand the body change
[20:27] then you must come to a place where you
[20:30] you're not relying on your own works
[20:32] you're relying on the finished prize the
[20:35] price that Jesus paid and to have that
[20:39] kind of a level correlation it's a
[20:41] revelation that God has paid the price
[20:43] so completely that your body can be
[20:46] changed and the works of the law will
[20:50] not justify your flesh
[20:52] doing stuff or not doing stuff will not
[20:54] justify your flesh it's only faith and
[20:56] what he has done that will justify any
[21:00] questions and answers program said oh
[21:02] there's so much of this legalism today
[21:04] that touch not taste not you don't do
[21:07] things legally I didn't come to this
[21:09] church tonight legally I know worse
[21:12] because I got to do it it's that as a
[21:15] law thing and this is where he starts
[21:18] getting into love you do things for God
[21:21] but it's like a marriage when you're
[21:23] married to your spouse you you're not
[21:26] running out cheating on that person or
[21:28] stuff like that you're not and the same
[21:30] thing spiritually you're not going out
[21:32] to listen to the doctor and doing doing
[21:34] things wrong because you love God you
[21:36] love his work
[21:38] but that's what makes you come to church
[21:40] me because you love God not because
[21:42] somebody's gonna bash you over the head
[21:44] because you don't come to church you
[21:47] should have been here that's not that's
[21:50] that's not what your spiritual life is
[21:53] based on I'm not saying that should not
[21:56] be done right because the law in must be
[21:58] preached that's the law aspect of it
[22:01] you're gonna we're gonna preach you need
[22:03] to be a church but one day it will turn
[22:06] into from a legal thing to to a love
[22:10] relationship and that's what he's
[22:11] talking about I felt anything but come
[22:13] down here why did I come there because I
[22:16] love God live or die I must stand here
[22:19] for him
[22:20] it's not because I have to he wouldn't
[22:22] care about whether I did or not think
[22:24] about that if I die I'd go to him and
[22:31] yeah but I'm coming because I love you
[22:35] you serve God because you love him not
[22:38] because you just got to do it because
[22:40] you love him enough and then here you
[22:44] hear me says the law is not a relic a
[22:46] law is the magnifying glass to show you
[22:50] seeing see why the law must be preached
[22:53] I believe the law is gotta be preached
[22:55] it's the one who can put you in prison
[22:58] it's a law but it has no redemption in
[23:01] it look where we're standing there when
[23:04] Peter spoke of that let one keep the law
[23:06] and then we do this and wonderful of
[23:07] that oh I'm so glad that there's
[23:09] somebody else to look to where we're
[23:12] standing in the realm of law and legal
[23:14] all by it we're all condemned and all
[23:16] flesh is condemned by the law and we
[23:19] were all born in sin shapen in iniquity
[23:21] come to the world speaking lies without
[23:23] not even a chance we don't have it how
[23:26] could we stand the Justice of God we
[23:29] couldn't stand it but thank God that he
[23:32] paid the price and all you have to do is
[23:35] like the children to be
[23:37] in Egypt looked at that braise the
[23:40] circum just look at live believe only if
[23:45] faith program said and Abraham was
[23:46] called by a grace in violation and when
[23:48] he was called when he was received his
[23:50] call he was given the Covenant of God
[23:52] not because he was a good man
[23:54] but it was given unconditionally to me
[23:56] not because he did anything but it was
[23:59] given to him just based simply on his
[24:02] faith just believe and everything else
[24:06] will be accomplished now this is going
[24:08] to hurt legalistic legalists believers
[24:10] just a little bit now I don't mean the
[24:12] pitch but we don't want to know the
[24:14] truth see there is nothing that a man
[24:17] can do to save himself
[24:20] you are already saved by grace that's
[24:24] right you can't stop eating meat you
[24:26] can't stop doing this
[24:29] you can't stop there's nothing you can
[24:31] do Christ saves you and that alone and
[24:35] that's right so we go like three more
[24:38] minutes some trouble grab up here and
[24:42] where's your divorce program said as
[24:44] long as I want to go do it it's in my
[24:46] heart to do it well I say as long as I
[24:49] said my heart to do it
[24:50] I don't do it II legalism won't let me
[24:53] do it now see here we're getting into
[24:54] legalism versus grace because there's
[24:57] got to be it is the law exposes that
[25:01] it's wrong to be puffing on a cigar and
[25:04] Indian alcohol and all those kind of
[25:06] things so you're not saved because you
[25:10] stopped doing those things but yet there
[25:12] is a promise in God's work to take that
[25:15] God will give you overcoming power to
[25:18] deliver that so you need a change down
[25:21] and your innermost being to where you
[25:23] don't want to do it anymore
[25:24] that's the power of the gospel there's
[25:26] power in the gospel to be able to take
[25:29] the desire for those think the
[25:31] conscience of seeing away from you to
[25:33] where you don't want to do it anymore
[25:34] and that's where the real truth of the
[25:36] gospel is it doesn't become a works
[25:38] anymore but it becomes a nature change
[25:41] where God is now living on the
[25:43] and has changed your desire from the
[25:46] things of the world to the things of God
[25:48] where now you didn't want to go to
[25:51] church now you won't the word because
[25:53] you're found the thing that will satisfy
[25:56] that first this on the inside and
[25:59] nothing will quench that thirst but the
[26:01] word of God the real truth of it is is
[26:04] when the love of God comes into your
[26:06] heart to you want to do it it is capital
[26:09] life you want to do it the Word of God
[26:13] you want to satisfy the Word of God
[26:15] that's the truth of it there is the two
[26:17] schools not legalism or other in
[26:19] Calvinism is both in Galatia I'm closing
[26:23] this stand fast therefore in the Liberty
[26:26] wherewith Christ hath made us free and
[26:28] be not entangled again with the yoke of
[26:31] bondage to feel like you got to do
[26:33] something to be saved behold I Paul say
[26:35] unto you that ye be circumcised Christ
[26:38] shall profit you nothing
[26:40] your works won't profit you anything for
[26:43] I testify again to every man that is
[26:45] circumcised that he is the debtor to the
[26:48] whole law if you think they're doing
[26:50] things doing or don't doing things will
[26:53] save you and you try to satisfy one iota
[26:56] of the law in that way now you've got to
[26:59] satisfy the whole ball that way and you
[27:02] got a problem because you can't do it
[27:05] Christ has become a mill effect on these
[27:08] whosoever of you are justified by the
[27:11] law which you cannot be but if you try
[27:14] to justify yourself by the law you are
[27:17] falling from grace I will stop right
[27:20] there
[27:21] [Music]
[27:42] whatever
