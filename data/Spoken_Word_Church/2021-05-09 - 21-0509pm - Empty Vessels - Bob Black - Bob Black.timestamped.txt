[25:53] sermon this morning that we heard
[25:59] i i we were actually talking about when
[26:01] we were up um
[26:03] i'm going to say some things about
[26:04] brother dale even though he's here when
[26:05] we were up at the camp meeting
[26:07] we were just kind of got to talking
[26:09] about how fortunate we are to have
[26:11] a good pastor that's taught us and
[26:12] settled us in the word so that when you
[26:14] go to a tent meeting that you can
[26:16] you know kind of understand what's being
[26:18] what's being preached on so we certainly
[26:19] appreciate brother dale and all the
[26:21] years
[26:22] that he's ministered to us and
[26:23] everything um
[26:42] all right here we go are we good now
[26:45] everybody can hear me
[26:46] yes okay appraisal all right so
[26:51] i wanted to speak uh this afternoon on a
[26:53] little subject from hebrews chapter 11
[26:55] and then from second corinthians chapter
[26:56] 12 if the brothers could
[26:58] could get set to turn to those chapters
[27:00] and just take a little topic of
[27:01] of empty vessels this afternoon and
[27:03] speak home and uh and
[27:06] and just see what the lord has for us
[27:08] let's go to the lord in prayer before we
[27:09] go to reading of the word lord god we
[27:11] thank you so much lord for the privilege
[27:12] to be able to gather together among your
[27:14] people lord we're
[27:15] so privileged to be able to know people
[27:17] that believe the same thing that we do
[27:19] lord and be able to gather together and
[27:21] fellowship with them lord and glean
[27:23] little tidbits of knowledge and
[27:24] information from one another and help
[27:26] one another along life's way lord and
[27:28] i believe lord you set things up so that
[27:30] we could lord we need one another we
[27:32] need to fellowship
[27:32] together with one another lord and all
[27:35] together under the leadership of the
[27:36] holy ghost
[27:37] lord jesus we come lord god i i believe
[27:40] lord maybe maybe this afternoon many
[27:42] have come with full vessels lord maybe
[27:43] with
[27:44] with pride and maybe enmity and
[27:46] bitterness that we build up against one
[27:47] another
[27:48] and maybe all kinds of doctrines that
[27:49] we've held over the years and things
[27:51] that
[27:51] people have piled up in us lord but i
[27:53] pray lord tonight lord you this
[27:55] afternoon lord that maybe we'll
[27:56] empty those things out lord and come
[27:58] with empty vessels that so that you can
[28:00] fill it up lord realizing that there's
[28:03] nothing within ourselves lord jesus that
[28:04] we can
[28:05] that can be of satisfaction to you lord
[28:07] jesus there's no strength within
[28:09] ourselves
[28:10] but all of our strength comes from you
[28:11] lord lord we look to you lord jesus with
[28:14] everything that we have need of lord
[28:16] tonight
[28:16] we pray lord that you'll be satisfied
[28:18] with our offerings of praise and our
[28:20] songs that we sing lord and
[28:22] lord that you'll just feel welcome to
[28:23] move among us this afternoon lord
[28:26] lord that we'll have church this
[28:27] afternoon lord and there won't just be a
[28:29] gathering together of
[28:30] just a vain worship but but of true
[28:32] worship knowing what we believe and in
[28:34] the god that we serve
[28:36] and lord we ask this blessing upon your
[28:38] people lord knowing that you hear and
[28:40] answer prayer
[28:41] and that you'll meet every need in the
[28:42] name of the lord jesus christ
[28:44] i pray amen
[28:47] so hebrews chapter 11 verses 32 to 40 it
[28:50] starts off and it says this and we know
[28:52] we all know hebrews chapter 11 is that
[28:54] that faith chapter that
[28:55] you know even you can't hardly read this
[28:57] without building up your faith and
[28:59] almost getting emotional and when you go
[29:01] and read all of the
[29:02] the things that that people have endured
[29:04] and everything
[29:05] and it starts off in verse 32 it says
[29:07] what more shall i
[29:08] what shall i more say for the time would
[29:11] fail to tell me of gideon and the barack
[29:13] and of samson and of jephthah and of
[29:15] david also and samuel and other prophets
[29:18] who through faith subdued kingdoms
[29:20] wrought righteousness obtained promises
[29:22] stopped the mouths of lions
[29:24] quenched the violence of fire escaped
[29:27] the edge of the sword out of weakness
[29:28] were made strong
[29:30] waxed value and fight turned to fight
[29:32] the armies of the aliens
[29:34] now now you know brother branham when he
[29:36] after after he got done reading the
[29:38] scripture he said he's talking about
[29:39] god's heroes
[29:40] these are god's heroes and and god wants
[29:44] to make a hero
[29:45] out of you so listen to how god made a
[29:47] hero out of them
[29:48] and that's how he'll make a hero out of
[29:50] you was it through their
[29:51] own effort and through their own might
[29:54] women received their dead raised to life
[29:57] again and others were tortured not
[29:58] accepting deliverance that they might
[30:00] obtain a better resurrection
[30:02] and others had trial of cruel mockings
[30:04] and scourgings yea
[30:05] moreover of bonds and imprisonment they
[30:08] were stoned they were sown asunder were
[30:10] tempted were slain with a sword they
[30:11] wandered about in sheepskins and goat
[30:13] skins
[30:14] being destitute afflicted tormented
[30:16] maybe maybe one time a good sermon to be
[30:18] preached
[30:19] what's the cost of being a christian
[30:21] because these people these gods heroes
[30:23] endured a lot and you know every
[30:25] every person that comes to god is going
[30:27] to go through a little testing time
[30:28] little little valleys and things
[30:30] sometimes it's not easy being a
[30:32] christian
[30:33] of whom the world was not worthy because
[30:36] they were god's heroes god's heroes
[30:38] they wandered in deserts and in
[30:40] mountains and in dens and caves of the
[30:41] earth
[30:42] and these all having obtained a good
[30:44] report through faith
[30:45] received not the promise god having
[30:47] provided something better thing for us
[30:49] that they without us should not be made
[30:53] perfect right now set that in your mind
[30:56] as we go to second corinthians 12
[30:58] 9 and we'll read this
[31:03] and he said unto me paul's speaking
[31:06] he said unto me my grace is sufficient
[31:08] for thee
[31:09] for my strength is made perfect in
[31:12] weakness
[31:13] most gladly therefore i will rather
[31:15] glory
[31:16] now this seems a very odd statement if
[31:18] you dwell on this and meditate it i will
[31:20] i would rather
[31:21] glory in my infirmities
[31:24] my what a strange thing for somebody to
[31:26] say that they will glory
[31:28] in their weakness i will rather glory in
[31:30] my infirmities
[31:31] that the power of christ may rest upon
[31:34] me
[31:35] you may have you may be seated the lord
[31:38] had his blessing to the reading of the
[31:39] word
[31:43] now one thing i maybe call out when we
[31:46] were
[31:46] up there listening listening to the
[31:48] brothers at the tent meeting and
[31:49] everything you know
[31:50] every night the different brothers was
[31:52] preach and
[31:53] and one thing i was talking to zach
[31:54] about this earlier that each night a
[31:56] brother would take a message that
[31:58] brother branham preached
[31:59] and you know of course if you don't read
[32:02] the message or listen to the message
[32:03] it's kind of hard to tell
[32:05] but you know one one night born brother
[32:07] preached on the countdown one night one
[32:08] brother preached on the masterpiece one
[32:10] night one brother preached on
[32:11] the attraction on the mount what is the
[32:12] attraction on the mount and you know
[32:14] those things kind of read true
[32:16] in other words the thing that i'm doing
[32:18] is taking a message
[32:19] is very common if you just know what to
[32:21] listen for so i'm taking a message to
[32:24] a perfect strength uh by perfect
[32:26] weakness
[32:27] and just kind of breaking it down and
[32:28] looking at some of these nuggets that
[32:30] are in here
[32:30] and even in this message when brother
[32:32] brian priests his sermon he talks about
[32:33] what a strange
[32:34] sermon what a strange kind of topic for
[32:37] somebody to take in
[32:38] kind of the pentecostal realm the
[32:39] pentecostal believers that's always
[32:40] talking about the power that we have
[32:42] and then to preach on weakness how how
[32:44] that how that weakness
[32:46] is almost a good thing we talk about in
[32:48] this this last verse in this
[32:50] in this chapter god having provided
[32:51] something better thing for us that they
[32:53] without us should not be made perfect
[32:54] ends with the word perfect
[32:56] and we talk about coming to perfection a
[32:58] lot perfect faith
[32:59] a perfect perfect love a perfect from a
[33:01] perfect god a perfect bride we talk
[33:03] about coming to perfection through the
[33:05] stature of a perfect man
[33:06] but really how do we come to perfection
[33:09] we come to perfection it won't be it
[33:11] won't be through our own power
[33:12] or our own might or anything that we can
[33:14] do within ourselves
[33:16] but it'll be a total reliance on god
[33:18] it'll be a total reliance
[33:20] you know even even maybe taking a step
[33:21] back looking as you look at me standing
[33:24] behind this pulpit
[33:25] i'm really there's almost like two two
[33:27] individuals maybe standing up here
[33:29] there's me the person
[33:30] the person and then as brother dale was
[33:32] bringing out this morning there's the
[33:33] office that i'm standing in the office
[33:35] being
[33:35] the the spirit of the living god that
[33:37] can speak through me if
[33:39] if i could get out of the way and that's
[33:41] the problem with every christian every
[33:42] believer
[33:43] if you could get out of the way and let
[33:45] god live brother brother said if we can
[33:47] get out of the way if we could get
[33:48] ourselves out of the way then deity
[33:49] could be expressed
[33:51] if we can get out of the way then god
[33:53] can make himself express
[33:55] so the problem that i have this more
[33:57] this afternoon is if i can get myself
[33:58] out of the way then i can say something
[34:00] profitable to you
[34:01] but if i don't get out of the way then i
[34:03] might be just be preaching for my own
[34:04] bitterness
[34:05] or my own complexes or their own my own
[34:07] things that
[34:08] i think need to be corrected in the
[34:09] church and i might be coming up here
[34:11] just to say something that would not be
[34:13] truly edifying but just to speak
[34:15] something that i within my own mind
[34:17] without my my own reasoning capacity i
[34:19] think would be helpful
[34:20] and it in the end would not be helpful
[34:22] at all but if i can get out of the way
[34:24] and let god speak
[34:25] then then you've got something now
[34:27] brother brahma said in the perfect
[34:29] strength by perfect weakness he said oh
[34:30] god strategy
[34:32] god strategy listen to this is to take
[34:34] empty
[34:35] empty human vessels and shake the world
[34:38] with him now to think about that that he
[34:39] can take a life that's
[34:41] all broken and all messed up and and if
[34:43] you just bring your empty vessel
[34:45] regardless of what your past is
[34:46] regardless of where you've been
[34:48] in life and bring that empty vessel to
[34:50] him then he can fill it up and make
[34:51] something useful out of it
[34:53] then he'll shake the world with it he'll
[34:55] shake your job with it he'll shake the
[34:56] church
[34:57] with the life that now you're
[34:58] demonstrating you'll shake everything
[35:00] with it
[35:00] because now you become one of god's
[35:03] heroes
[35:04] somebody that was maybe before was
[35:06] living a broken
[35:07] tore up life and now god comes and fills
[35:09] you up with something that
[35:11] beyond all of your human effort anything
[35:13] that you can do of yourself
[35:15] and fills you up with the life of god to
[35:17] shake the world
[35:18] and brother brown said that at pentecost
[35:20] what did he do at pentecost
[35:22] he said it took them 10 days 10 days to
[35:24] get all emptied out now
[35:26] imagine them sitting up in that upper
[35:27] room wondering who is going to be the
[35:29] greatest and wondering who
[35:30] wondered who you know remembering who
[35:32] offended somebody and
[35:33] peter i remember what you did you'd
[35:35] betrayed jesus three times and
[35:37] all these kind of things and heaping all
[35:38] that but ten after ten days
[35:40] every day maybe a little bit more
[35:42] emptied out emptied out into it out
[35:44] until finally
[35:45] god was able to come on the scene and do
[35:47] something and if you and i could ever
[35:48] get ourselves emptied out to where we
[35:51] lay aside all of our reasoning and lay
[35:52] aside all of our bitterness
[35:54] and lay aside all of our complexes
[35:56] you'll see god come on the scene and do
[35:58] something
[35:58] you'll see god be able to shake the
[36:00] world with your empty vessel
[36:02] with your poor tore up life see god be
[36:04] able to grab a hold of you and do
[36:06] something with you
[36:07] and jesus brother and said they was all
[36:09] standing there with their vessels turned
[36:11] up
[36:12] with their vessels turned up and god
[36:14] took himself
[36:15] and filled them up that's all they shook
[36:17] the world
[36:18] you see if we could just realize like
[36:20] they did they realized that they were
[36:22] insufficient
[36:23] how could they take a gospel to the
[36:25] world how could they fulfill mark 16
[36:27] they needed something that they did not
[36:29] have and there's something else that you
[36:31] and i need
[36:32] you and i need brother when he got to
[36:34] the end of this message he was talking
[36:35] about how
[36:36] all the devils had been unleashed at
[36:38] this age all the devil's
[36:40] loosed at the river euphrates all
[36:42] everything coming against the bride
[36:43] and how will you be able to conquer how
[36:45] will you be able to overcome
[36:47] without god on your side without god
[36:49] without god making complete preeminence
[36:52] giving yourself holy over to god so that
[36:54] he has your soul and your spirit and
[36:56] your body
[36:56] and everything under his control
[37:00] now brother brown let me let me let me
[37:02] get on to a come maybe an odds odd way
[37:04] to start this sermon off
[37:05] we're talking about the insufficiency of
[37:07] man the insufficiency of you to do
[37:10] anything
[37:10] the insufficiency of the preacher to do
[37:12] anything of his own self
[37:14] and the way brother branham started this
[37:15] message off was talking about altar
[37:20] calls
[37:22] he said i want to say that and clear so
[37:24] that you'll understand
[37:26] now listen the way that he brings us out
[37:28] this is such a controversial topic
[37:30] he said there never was an altar call
[37:32] made in all the bible
[37:34] there's no such a thing in the scripture
[37:36] nowhere down through the ages was it
[37:38] made to the methodist stage about 200
[37:40] years ago see
[37:41] altar calls now later on in this message
[37:43] he'll call it an artificial altar call
[37:46] so if there's an artificial altar call
[37:48] there's got to be a true altar call
[37:50] there's an artificial altar call where
[37:52] man gets involved
[37:53] and there's a true altar call where it's
[37:55] god doing the calling
[37:56] and so we don't want an altar call where
[37:58] man gets involved where man is the one
[38:00] saying come up where man is the one
[38:02] saying surrender but when god gets
[38:04] involved and you lay your heart on the
[38:06] altar because not because a man could
[38:08] miss you
[38:09] not because a man told you a good old
[38:11] sob story and maybe told you to go
[38:13] go watch a movie about jesus dying on
[38:15] the cross and it made you cry big old
[38:16] crocodiles crocodile tears but because
[38:19] you heard the word and the word of god
[38:21] caused
[38:22] something on the inside of your heart to
[38:23] respond then you've got a true
[38:26] altar call you you see why you maybe
[38:30] when you miss it listen
[38:31] go back and listen to this message you
[38:32] begin to wonder what does altar call
[38:34] have to do with
[38:35] perfect strength by perfect weakness
[38:37] because you've got to be successful in
[38:39] anything to be a successful christian
[38:41] to be successful message believer you've
[38:43] got to get all of your humanity out of
[38:45] the way
[38:46] you've got to get all of your human
[38:47] involvement out of the way and let god
[38:49] do everything
[38:51] bill brandon said altar calls are when
[38:53] people come up and try to persuade and
[38:55] pull people
[38:56] come on john you know that
[38:59] your mother died praying for you your
[39:02] mother died and you get to cry no big
[39:04] old crocodile
[39:04] crocodile tears come on john that's not
[39:07] conviction friends that's not conviction
[39:10] them kind of very seldom if you ever
[39:12] hear that one goes very far
[39:14] and in that you get everything that's
[39:16] the reason the church is all muddled up
[39:17] the way it is today is because of such
[39:19] things
[39:20] conviction you don't have to say a thing
[39:23] brother you don't have to say a thing of
[39:24] yourself
[39:25] you don't have to tell a big old sob
[39:27] story anything god's there
[39:29] and done done the work wow and he quotes
[39:32] while peter spake these words the holy
[39:34] ghost fell on them and they heard the
[39:35] word in other words what does it
[39:36] what causes a true altar call the
[39:38] preaching of the gospel
[39:40] and when the preaching of the gospel
[39:41] goes what is the preaching of the gospel
[39:43] to realize that jesus paid the price for
[39:45] you that you don't have to work up
[39:47] nothing that he's already done it
[39:48] that he's looking at you now through the
[39:50] blood of the sacrifice
[39:51] that he's not looking at your sins but
[39:53] they're covered by the blood
[39:55] all he hears is you crying up to him
[39:57] saying father forgive me i know i've
[39:58] done wrong and he's not looking at you
[40:00] that's what the gospel message is and
[40:02] that's what will bring conviction not
[40:04] somebody
[40:05] cry making somebody tell somebody a stop
[40:07] stop or anything
[40:08] he said see there's no altar call see no
[40:10] such a thing
[40:12] a real altar call a real altar call is
[40:15] god doing the calling
[40:16] god doing the calling and brother goes
[40:19] on to quote what he said because jesus
[40:20] listen jesus said no man could come to
[40:22] me except my father draws him first
[40:24] and all that the father has given me
[40:26] will come to me that's right
[40:28] that throws your altar call completely
[40:30] out altogether see
[40:34] our responsibility has preached the word
[40:36] the bible said as many as believed
[40:38] was baptized now what's really strange
[40:41] though
[40:42] is at the end of this sermon brother
[40:43] branham makes a true altar call
[40:45] a true altar call where the word being
[40:48] preached causes a reaction to the people
[40:50] and they begin to lay their lives down
[40:51] they begin to call upon the name of the
[40:53] lord they begin to give their hearts
[40:54] over to god because you see
[40:56] a true altar call is god doing the work
[40:58] a true anything
[40:59] is when god actually does the thing
[41:02] when man gets himself in the way when
[41:04] man can get himself
[41:06] in the way it just messes everything up
[41:08] we fail to realize we fail to realize
[41:10] that god wants us
[41:11] he wants us to come empty so he can use
[41:14] us he wants us to come empty
[41:16] now brother adam told this story he's
[41:17] told this story about how he
[41:19] he said mama charlie cox up there in
[41:21] kentucky that uh
[41:23] uh she she began to hand out tracks and
[41:26] she got some a little sister to start
[41:27] coming to the church there
[41:29] and when brother branham went to preach
[41:30] there in kentucky that the little sister
[41:32] wanted to talk to him
[41:33] now listen listen good to this story
[41:35] we're talking about weakness
[41:37] and he said i went into a home just a
[41:39] little before that i was standing on the
[41:40] outside and the lady said i'd like to
[41:42] speak to that minister
[41:44] and i went into their little home and
[41:46] she said your brother branham
[41:48] and i said yes ma'am and she said i am
[41:51] so ashamed of the looks of my house
[41:54] and she said to ask you in she started
[41:56] weeping
[41:57] she said but i have such a need and i
[41:59] got real confidence in you now here's a
[42:02] little sister that's living in maybe a
[42:03] little ramshackle
[42:05] shack on the side of the road now we
[42:07] we've been monica's
[42:08] brother lives right across the street
[42:10] from the house that uh mama cox was in
[42:12] and we
[42:13] every time we go up there to visit we
[42:14] look at that house and and
[42:16] that house as a little almost run down
[42:18] little house
[42:19] where brother brown used to stay at that
[42:20] house and this house he's talking about
[42:23] another little sister that lives in such
[42:24] a humble little place
[42:26] and she said i'm embarrassed for you to
[42:27] come into my house i'm embarrassed now
[42:29] now you think about maybe you
[42:31] let's put it personal to you you and
[42:33] your ramshackle house
[42:35] with all of your your torah back life
[42:38] all of the stuff that you've been maybe
[42:39] involved with who knows what your story
[42:41] is
[42:42] and maybe you're ashamed to have jesus
[42:43] christ come into your house
[42:45] like this woman was because the way
[42:47] brother branham explained it was she did
[42:48] not realize
[42:50] that god wants you to be weak he wants
[42:53] you to be weak and realize that you need
[42:55] him and we get all built up we want to
[42:57] be somebody
[42:58] she thought that that brother brandon
[42:59] would feel more at home and maybe a
[43:01] mansion like donald trump has with
[43:03] gold leaf bathrooms and all that stuff
[43:05] all over are decorated but god wants
[43:07] humility and meekness and he just
[43:10] he said i looked around in this home a
[43:13] little home
[43:14] a little home about like i was raised in
[43:17] but the wall full of pictures of christ
[43:20] he stepped in and all around that home
[43:22] was decorated with pictures of christ
[43:24] he said there laid a bible on the table
[43:27] i said i never any more honor in my life
[43:31] i never any more honor in my life this
[43:34] is the kind of home
[43:36] i like to walk into a home that looked
[43:38] poor on the outside
[43:40] now your your house on the outside you
[43:42] might have knee problems you might have
[43:44] back problems you might have all kinds
[43:45] of things but god
[43:46] god does not care he wants you to be
[43:48] weak so that you trust in him
[43:50] because you will not overcome by your
[43:52] own efforts or by your
[43:54] own your own abilities he said she asked
[43:57] a request for someone five hours from
[43:59] the time that we prayed together this
[44:01] little grandmother and i prayed together
[44:03] god had answered god answered the prayer
[44:06] of that little sister down in her old
[44:07] ramshackle house
[44:09] in the middle of kentucky back where
[44:11] probably no great man had been the
[44:13] president never went there
[44:15] but a little prophet came and entered in
[44:17] that home and felt welcome there
[44:20] he said we try to make our weaknesses
[44:22] excuses
[44:23] now if you could get this we try to make
[44:25] our weaknesses excuses
[44:28] he said we want to tell how big we are
[44:30] how great we are
[44:32] i think that's one of the things that
[44:34] god gave me the text for this is brother
[44:36] brethren saying this
[44:37] was to get that out of our mind get it
[44:40] out of your mind that you're supposed to
[44:42] be a big shot
[44:43] get it out of your mind that you're
[44:44] supposed to be a big shot message
[44:45] preacher
[44:46] that you're supposed to be an evangelist
[44:48] on the field all the time get it out of
[44:49] your mind that you're supposed to have a
[44:50] big position in church
[44:52] get it out of your mind that you're
[44:53] supposed to be real important get it out
[44:55] of your mind because
[44:56] god wants to see somebody that's weak
[44:59] and humble that he can work
[45:00] through that ain't got nothing no
[45:02] ability to their name they can't do
[45:04] nothing of their own self
[45:05] they're completely relying on him
[45:08] [Applause]
[45:11] brother braham said there's so many of
[45:13] us likes to testify
[45:14] or likes to think that we're
[45:16] insufficient and therefore
[45:18] we make that an excuse we'll make it an
[45:21] excuse we'll say i don't have any
[45:23] education
[45:24] i ain't got no education where that's
[45:25] exactly where god wants you to be
[45:27] so that you'll rely on him you'll say i
[45:30] ain't got no ability
[45:31] i can't do it on myself and that's
[45:33] exactly where god wants you to be
[45:35] how how can you how can you get rid of
[45:37] all those problems how can you get rid
[45:39] of that pride on your own
[45:40] how can you get rid of that bitterness
[45:42] but if you rely on god he'll get rid of
[45:44] it
[45:44] he's the one you'll say i'm unable to do
[45:48] this
[45:50] and brother i said if you keep that up
[45:52] and do that in that way
[45:54] keep going that like that then you can't
[45:57] mount to anything
[45:59] you'll never amount to nothing if you
[46:01] keep looking at your excuse and your
[46:02] weakness
[46:03] as an excuse you'll never amount to
[46:05] anything
[46:06] but the very thing that we make excuses
[46:09] by our weaknesses
[46:10] god uses that very thing to tackle the
[46:13] job with
[46:14] do you realize that your weaknesses is
[46:16] what god wants to see
[46:18] he doesn't want to see a strong church
[46:20] somebody that can't be taught
[46:21] somebody they can't be reasoned with
[46:23] come in with your big old intellect and
[46:24] everything
[46:25] sit down on the pew and say i'm not
[46:27] accepting none of that but he wants to
[46:29] see somebody come in
[46:30] with an empty vessel pour it out with
[46:32] you don't have no pride
[46:33] you'll understand of yourself you're
[46:35] ready to receive
[46:36] somebody say i need god because i'm weak
[46:39] in myself
[46:40] how can i heal myself how can i save
[46:42] myself
[46:43] i need jesus christ brother of america
[46:46] said we must come to find our weaknesses
[46:48] find our black bad places and see how
[46:51] little we are
[46:53] and put our trust in somebody that's
[46:56] strong
[46:57] this afternoon are you ready to put your
[46:59] trust in somebody that's strong
[47:01] maybe all this time you've been putting
[47:02] your trust trying to put yourself make
[47:04] yourself strong
[47:05] and trying to put your trust in your own
[47:07] self
[47:08] now it's time to come with an empty
[47:10] vessel and lay down all those ideas and
[47:13] cut put your
[47:14] put your trust wholly in in one that's
[47:16] strong one that can
[47:17] one that can meet every need one that
[47:19] can satisfy
[47:20] every empty place brother brown said
[47:23] that's the reason
[47:25] that's the reason why he chooses us
[47:28] because
[47:29] we're in that condition and he said we
[47:32] find out that those people who are the
[47:33] weakest
[47:34] and the rejected by the outside world is
[47:36] what
[47:38] is god's heroes god's heroes
[47:43] so don't ever don't ever try to be great
[47:47] don't ever try to work up something
[47:49] within yourself i'm reading
[47:50] these are these are brother brown's
[47:51] words practically this whole sermon is
[47:53] brother brown's words
[47:55] don't ever try to be great don't ever
[47:58] try to work up something within yourself
[48:01] to try to work up something so that you
[48:02] can show your great ability
[48:05] don't ever try to be strong within
[48:07] yourself because god wants to use
[48:09] somebody that is weak
[48:14] so somebody brother brown says so
[48:15] somebody came up to him and he said
[48:18] they said to me long ago said brother
[48:20] branham said we just received the holy
[48:21] ghost
[48:22] shall we now seek for gifts for our
[48:24] ministry now listen to the way he lays
[48:26] this out
[48:26] what should i seek for gifts for the
[48:28] ministry now what would a gift do to a
[48:30] little baby christian a gift
[48:32] what what purpose would a gift a gift
[48:34] would help maybe a little bit
[48:35] but a gift before long it would begin to
[48:37] puff up somebody in their head
[48:39] a lot you know one of the chiefest gifts
[48:40] that a lot of people want is they want
[48:42] discernment
[48:43] it seems like in my christian walk i've
[48:44] run across so many people i i just
[48:47] there would be reams of pages of a
[48:48] people that i met before that say they
[48:50] have some level of discernment
[48:52] now let's think about that for a second
[48:53] what would discernment do for you
[48:55] let's say that you were able to talk to
[48:56] somebody and all of a sudden you realize
[48:58] that they had adultery in their life or
[48:59] they had they were living in fornication
[49:01] or whatever
[49:02] now what you going to do with it what
[49:05] you going to do with that information
[49:06] now you got the goods on somebody what
[49:08] you going to do with that something a
[49:09] little baby
[49:10] little baby christian i'll tell you what
[49:11] they do they go on facebook and make a
[49:13] lot of vague posts about it
[49:15] okay but when i ran across somebody i
[49:17] can't believe that so-and-so would
[49:19] you know make a vague because what what
[49:21] would you do with that information
[49:23] if all it does is puff up your head and
[49:26] make you think that you're a big shot
[49:27] then why would you want a gift but gifts
[49:30] i believe that god reserves gifts
[49:32] for adults god reserves a gift for
[49:35] mature christians
[49:36] that will know what to do with it that
[49:38] won't pit or pattern around with it
[49:39] and it won't puff up their head but
[49:41] they'll they'll be mature enough to know
[49:42] what to do with it maybe
[49:44] maybe if god gives you a gift maybe if
[49:46] you got a true gift a mature
[49:48] christian you won't go running around
[49:49] telling everybody about it bragging
[49:51] about it maybe it's something that
[49:52] maybe only between you and god that you
[49:54] know of him or and maybe the pastor
[49:56] maybe just a few people but maybe god is
[49:59] withholding that from you
[50:00] maybe god is waiting to unleash that
[50:03] gift in your life because
[50:05] he knows that you won't do the right
[50:06] thing with it now listen what brother
[50:08] brown says about it he said i said
[50:10] i said don't do it let it alone
[50:13] don't seek for gifts and he turned and
[50:15] looked at me said i just read a certain
[50:17] brothers book that told us after we
[50:18] received the holy ghost we should seek
[50:19] gifts for these to use this holy ghost
[50:21] i said and become a stuffed shirt see
[50:24] and become a stuffed shirt right
[50:26] and what is this stuff shirt a stuffed
[50:27] shirt is a smug conceited and usually
[50:29] pompous person
[50:30] a person who behaves in a very formal
[50:33] way and expects
[50:34] expects to be treated as somebody
[50:35] important i'm important
[50:37] my do you do you realize if a little
[50:39] baby had discernment
[50:40] my goodness i got the goods on you i i
[50:44] know
[50:44] all the uh maybe it will be able to list
[50:46] all your faults out but what good would
[50:48] that do
[50:49] what good would that do what good would
[50:50] it be able to talk to little young
[50:52] people and whatever and
[50:53] and say well i know all you're false i
[50:55] don't want to know everybody's faults
[50:57] i want to i want to see you saved i want
[50:59] to see you delivered
[51:00] i don't want to have a big old list that
[51:01] i can parade in front of you
[51:05] you know you see becoming a stuffed
[51:07] shirt is the exact opposite of what god
[51:09] wants us to be
[51:10] what we would say i'm the one i'm the
[51:12] one that would should sit on the
[51:13] platform with all the ministers i'm
[51:14] going to parade myself up there and sit
[51:16] on the platform whatever so that
[51:17] everybody can see me
[51:18] i'm the one that should sing the songs
[51:20] you see what happens when god gives you
[51:22] a gift maybe you've got a gift of
[51:23] singing
[51:24] and before long if you're not careful
[51:25] you begin to think that i'm the one that
[51:27] should always be singing the songs
[51:29] i'm the one that can bring down the
[51:30] presence of the lord i'm the one that
[51:32] can do it right
[51:32] and then before long you i've got a big
[51:34] old stuffed shirt
[51:36] i'm the one that should have first place
[51:38] is what what you begin to think i'm the
[51:39] one
[51:40] i'm the one you've got to regard me
[51:42] you've got to pay attention to me
[51:43] and that's the exact opposite of what
[51:45] brother now listen
[51:46] listen these are not my word i'm just
[51:48] i'm just saying what brother branham
[51:49] said
[51:50] you would be surprised how it causes a
[51:52] reaction when you just say what brother
[51:53] branham said
[51:54] i'm just saying what brother graham said
[51:56] if you want to get mad at anybody for
[51:57] saying these things get
[51:58] up brother branham he said i said don't
[52:01] sing nothing
[52:03] god's got anything for you he'll give it
[52:05] to you
[52:06] and just let him take care of that just
[52:09] let him take care of that because it
[52:10] would be better
[52:11] it would be better to walk in weakness
[52:13] and humility than to be a stuffed shirt
[52:15] with a gift
[52:16] it was better to be a nobody it would be
[52:18] a better better it would be better to be
[52:19] a a doormat where everybody in the
[52:22] church could walk by like brother brown
[52:23] mentioned an influence
[52:24] and the message influence and just
[52:26] scrape the bottom of their boot off of
[52:27] you
[52:27] and wipe their boot off for you it would
[52:29] be better to be like that than to be a
[52:31] stuffed shirt with a gift
[52:32] it would be better to be a nobody in the
[52:34] church i i want to be i want to live in
[52:37] weakness
[52:37] listen if you can get to the place of
[52:39] ministers where you don't care if you
[52:41] never preach another sermon
[52:42] as long as god can have the preeminence
[52:44] in you i i
[52:46] i don't care about being a great man i
[52:48] don't want to be a great man i want god
[52:50] to be able to do something in my life
[52:54] instead of trying to be great we ought
[52:56] to be trying to find out how little we
[52:58] can get brother brahma said see
[53:00] then god can use us he said when you are
[53:02] big
[53:03] you know when you are big god can't use
[53:05] you but when you are little
[53:07] god can work psalm 24
[53:11] 7 says some trusting chariots and summon
[53:13] horses but we will remember the name of
[53:15] the lord our god
[53:17] some put all that trust in what what you
[53:19] can do with your big old chariot or
[53:21] your big your big car or whatever
[53:22] whatever it is and second corinthians
[53:24] says such trust have we through christ
[53:26] to godward
[53:27] not that we are sufficient of ourselves
[53:29] to think anything as of ourselves
[53:31] but our sufficiency is of god second
[53:34] corinthians 4 7 but we have this
[53:36] treasure in earth and vessels
[53:38] that the excellency of the power may be
[53:40] of god maybe of
[53:42] god and not of us
[53:45] you see brother brahma said when they
[53:46] feel like they can't they haven't got
[53:48] nothing
[53:49] that's when god can take a hold of him
[53:51] and do something with him
[53:52] but when we are thinking that we're able
[53:54] to do it then god can't use
[53:56] us because we're wanting to do it
[53:58] ourselves so if you can get it out of
[54:00] your head that you can do it yourself
[54:02] then god can begin to work god wants you
[54:04] to recognize your insufficiency
[54:06] so that you'll put all of your trust on
[54:08] him all of your trust
[54:10] on him and not on yourself
[54:13] but then he said on the other side we
[54:15] get these feelings and then we think
[54:16] that we're insufficient
[54:18] and we don't want to do it but then if
[54:21] we just listen to the call of god
[54:23] that's the very thing that god wants us
[54:25] to get into
[54:27] that kind of a shape so he can now am i
[54:30] to think about that that we think that
[54:33] god wants us to come out all bold and
[54:35] everything which
[54:36] boldness comes from the spirit of god
[54:38] you see but when you come out thinking
[54:40] that
[54:40] god wants you to be in a place of
[54:42] insufficiency
[54:44] god wants you to feel like many times
[54:46] god god wants weak preachers
[54:49] that's a weird really strict strange
[54:50] thing to say god wants
[54:52] weak weak young people god wants weak
[54:55] old people he wants you to realize that
[54:57] you can't do it in your own self
[54:59] and to rely completely on him he said so
[55:02] long as we're trying in ourselves and
[55:04] depending on our abilities and so forth
[55:05] why
[55:06] we'll do nothing but when we get to a
[55:09] place where we know we're nothing then
[55:11] god can use us
[55:13] god wants to pour the backwards the
[55:15] outcasts the broken vessels
[55:18] and he said there's one thing that we've
[55:20] got to master
[55:22] there's one thing that we've got to
[55:23] master if we expect to fulfill god's
[55:25] desire in our life
[55:27] and that is we have to master the
[55:29] thought of human ability
[55:31] the thought that i can't do it the
[55:33] thought cause you can't do it but when
[55:35] you think that you can then you won't
[55:36] you won't be able to he said if we ever
[55:39] get to a spot where we think that we can
[55:41] do it with our own intelligence
[55:42] and our own abilities we've got to
[55:44] master that in such a way
[55:46] that we can get rid of that thing and
[55:48] lay it aside so that god can use us
[55:51] he said we cannot use one ability we've
[55:54] got to make a complete surrender
[55:56] and to come to god you've got to
[55:58] surrender to him both soul
[56:00] body and spirit everything that you are
[56:02] has to be surrendered to god
[56:04] in order that he can work his will in
[56:06] you and me
[56:08] in order that he can work now see then
[56:10] he goes on to talk about how you can't
[56:12] you can't get strength you can't get
[56:13] strength from your own self
[56:15] and you can't that also means that you
[56:17] can't get strength
[56:18] from any man you can only get strength
[56:22] from god
[56:23] you cannot you and that's our problem we
[56:25] so many so often start
[56:26] looking at one another as our example
[56:29] but if we'll keep our eyes solely on god
[56:32] because you don't get your strength you
[56:34] don't get your strength from yourself
[56:36] you don't get your strength from anybody
[56:38] else and he quote john
[56:40] chapter 5 verse 41 to 45 he said i
[56:42] receive not honor from men
[56:45] but i know you that you have not the
[56:47] love of god in you
[56:49] i am come in my father's name and you
[56:50] receive me not if and another shall come
[56:52] in his own name him you will receive
[56:54] how can you believe which receive honor
[56:57] one of another and seek not the honor
[56:59] that cometh from god only
[57:01] and brother branham's explanation when
[57:03] she preached this sermon
[57:04] was how are you gonna have faith if
[57:06] you're trying to get strength from
[57:08] somebody else's relationship with god
[57:10] you can't even get strength from your
[57:12] own from your own doings from your own
[57:14] ability how are you going to get
[57:15] strength from looking at another man
[57:18] keep your eye solely on god
[57:21] when he said when we are expecting
[57:23] saying this guy he's a great person this
[57:25] is a great person i'll just
[57:27] lean upon him i'll just lean upon him
[57:30] he said that displeases god when you do
[57:33] that
[57:34] we must lean upon god and god alone
[57:37] we mustn't trust the ability of
[57:39] ourselves or any man
[57:41] we must completely yield to god and
[57:44] that's why in jeremiah chapter
[57:45] 17. now this is a this is a powerful
[57:47] scripture to quote
[57:48] jeremiah 17 says cursed be the man that
[57:51] trusteth in man
[57:53] and maketh flesh his arm and whose heart
[57:55] departeth from the lord
[57:57] and do you see you see the danger in
[57:59] that
[58:00] as soon as you begin to trust in
[58:02] somebody like look at all these people
[58:04] that left the message as soon as they
[58:06] their congregation doesn't know which
[58:07] way to turn because they they begin to
[58:09] trust in somebody instead of putting all
[58:11] of their
[58:12] getting all of their strength from god
[58:13] alone he said no ability i don't care
[58:16] whose it is will never be usable in the
[58:17] sight of god
[58:18] i don't care who that is god has to get
[58:21] all of our abilities
[58:22] out of us before he can achieve his
[58:24] purpose
[58:26] if he's got something for us to do and
[58:28] as long as we feel that we're doing a
[58:29] pretty good job of it
[58:31] then we'll never be able to use to be
[58:33] used of god
[58:37] see what god is looking for he's looking
[58:39] he's looking for little rejects
[58:41] he's looking for those broken vessels
[58:43] that he can grab up out of the out of
[58:44] the pile the ash heap
[58:46] and put back into purpose for himself
[58:48] he's looking for shattered lives like
[58:50] like rahab now you think about rahab
[58:53] sitting on that wall and
[58:54] in her life she had gotten herself into
[58:56] that miserable situation
[58:57] where to make money she had to sell
[58:59] herself she had to sell her body and
[59:00] there she was on that wall
[59:02] and here come the messenger the
[59:03] ministers to pay her a visit
[59:05] and that was exactly the kind of person
[59:08] that god was looking for
[59:09] because she was all she was broken up
[59:11] she was her life her backstory was just
[59:13] miserable
[59:14] she had a shattered life at least
[59:16] brother branham would put it she was the
[59:18] off scourer of the earth
[59:19] and that's what god is looking for he's
[59:21] looking for the off scour of the earth
[59:23] he's looking for somebody that can't say
[59:25] they're
[59:25] save their self and knows it the woman
[59:28] of samaria the woman at the well who had
[59:30] five husbands and
[59:31] and the one she had then when jesus was
[59:33] talking to her
[59:34] she she wasn't living too with an and
[59:37] she wasn't married to and
[59:41] you know the samaritans the jews
[59:43] couldn't even talk to them they were
[59:44] they were treated like dogs
[59:46] they were treated like they would they
[59:47] would skirt around some area but that
[59:48] was exactly the kind of person that
[59:50] jesus wanted to find
[59:52] he wanted to find somebody that could
[59:53] not help themselves
[59:55] a little woman like ruth that that maybe
[59:57] a lot of the jews wouldn't even talk to
[59:58] from moab from moab with all
[1:00:00] think about that horrible backstory of
[1:00:02] where moab even started from from lot
[1:00:04] and his daughters
[1:00:06] maybe they what a testimony to think
[1:00:08] about the the heritage that the
[1:00:10] the the people of moab had from but that
[1:00:14] that's exactly the kind of people that
[1:00:15] god is looking for
[1:00:16] unpopular somebody that doesn't fit in
[1:00:19] somebody that doesn't fit in with school
[1:00:21] with
[1:00:21] maybe maybe you're not interested in
[1:00:22] sports and all the popular stuff that
[1:00:24] they're doing at school
[1:00:25] but that's exactly the kind of person
[1:00:27] that god is looking for
[1:00:29] people with problems people with issues
[1:00:32] somebody with a lot a whole a whole
[1:00:34] laundry list of issues that
[1:00:35] that somebody's got to deal with and you
[1:00:37] can't deal with him yourself but god can
[1:00:40] god can take those issues and do
[1:00:42] something with he can take that broken
[1:00:44] empty vessel
[1:00:45] patch it back together and fill it up
[1:00:46] and do something useful with it
[1:00:49] see brother brown said history proves
[1:00:51] that god always chooses the nobodies
[1:00:54] to to become his somebodies he always
[1:00:57] chooses the nobodies to become his
[1:00:59] somebodies god takes the person
[1:01:01] he takes the person that's nothing
[1:01:04] now that should build all of our faith
[1:01:06] up right
[1:01:07] let's see there's nobody in here that's
[1:01:09] beyond the reach of god because he wants
[1:01:11] somebody that's nothing
[1:01:12] he wants somebody that's broken on the
[1:01:14] ash heap of despair on the ash heap of
[1:01:16] life
[1:01:17] and brother said that he said here's
[1:01:18] something to console us here's something
[1:01:20] that encourages
[1:01:22] out of weakness and humility god chooses
[1:01:24] the people to build his kingdom out of
[1:01:26] if we ever get to heaven if we ever
[1:01:28] stand in the presence of god with his
[1:01:30] church
[1:01:30] we'll stand and a bunch of people that's
[1:01:32] been weak and rejected and cast out by
[1:01:34] the world
[1:01:35] and know what nothing's you'll stand
[1:01:37] amongst all of those people that were
[1:01:39] listed out in the chronicles of hebrews
[1:01:40] 11
[1:01:41] all the ones that through fire and
[1:01:43] through torture and all of that overcame
[1:01:45] not through their own power but through
[1:01:46] their own weakness trusting in one who
[1:01:49] had the strength
[1:01:50] through through their own denying their
[1:01:52] own ability my my you think about what
[1:01:54] how glorious heaven is going to be to be
[1:01:56] amongst people that did not come out of
[1:01:58] maybe king's palaces
[1:01:59] but came out of the the side of the road
[1:02:02] that's pulled up off the side of the
[1:02:04] rejects the world's rejects
[1:02:09] brother brown said that's god's
[1:02:10] opportunity that's god's way of getting
[1:02:12] to us
[1:02:13] is when we're weak we get something then
[1:02:15] this encourages
[1:02:16] us encourages of course because god's
[1:02:18] whole kingdom is built out of these kind
[1:02:21] of people
[1:02:22] his whole kingdom is built out of
[1:02:23] rejects his whole kingdom was built out
[1:02:26] of people that don't know hardly how to
[1:02:27] read their bible
[1:02:28] after like like a certain minister what
[1:02:30] we know of that they couldn't even read
[1:02:32] his bible and said god help me to read
[1:02:34] my bible and god opened up his eyes
[1:02:36] so he could read so he could read the
[1:02:37] bible rejects that don't even know how
[1:02:39] to read
[1:02:40] rejects like peter and all the disciples
[1:02:42] listen i'm preaching to you an
[1:02:43] encouraging message this afternoon
[1:02:45] i'm preaching to you there's hope it
[1:02:47] don't matter what where you are in your
[1:02:48] life
[1:02:50] he said remember it's the off scours
[1:02:52] that god always picks up
[1:02:54] the nobodies then he makes them
[1:02:56] somebodies for him
[1:02:58] he said may not know it in this life but
[1:03:00] it will be
[1:03:01] in the one that's coming that my you
[1:03:04] think after this life's over after all
[1:03:06] the heartaches and trials and everything
[1:03:08] we're going to something more glorious
[1:03:10] than you could ever comprehend
[1:03:11] and it'll be a place where all the
[1:03:14] rejects and the nobodies and
[1:03:15] know-nothings are gathered together
[1:03:17] where god made somebody that ain't
[1:03:19] nothing somebody he took somebody off
[1:03:21] the side of the road and put him and
[1:03:22] made him apprentice with god
[1:03:25] he said if you're nothing you're
[1:03:26] something to god if you're a nobody
[1:03:28] you're somebody to god
[1:03:30] all right but now listen listen now the
[1:03:32] devil
[1:03:33] the devil wants to get you and that's
[1:03:34] where he wants to get you the devil
[1:03:36] wants to get you to make you think that
[1:03:38] you're already full
[1:03:40] to make you think that well i'm in a i'm
[1:03:42] in a good state right now i i i'm in a
[1:03:45] good now listen to how brother brown
[1:03:46] says
[1:03:47] he said he made this statement if the
[1:03:49] devil can't get you on this side he'll
[1:03:51] put you off to that side
[1:03:52] and we got to have a balance what are
[1:03:54] the two sides
[1:03:56] how much you know and how much you sense
[1:03:59] how much you know and how much you feel
[1:04:03] he said some of us build it upon
[1:04:04] intellectual conception oh
[1:04:06] that this know-it-all this man's a
[1:04:09] trained scholar we should train our
[1:04:10] people and school them in other words
[1:04:12] look how much i know
[1:04:14] look how much understanding that i have
[1:04:16] and now i'm so built up within myself
[1:04:18] and then you become arrogant and you get
[1:04:19] real prideful
[1:04:20] now look let's look on the other side of
[1:04:22] the fence the next one bases it upon
[1:04:24] some sensation of movement shaking
[1:04:26] crying
[1:04:27] shouting dancing in the spirit or
[1:04:29] something some emotional outward work
[1:04:31] and he said that's just as bad
[1:04:34] as the education both of them are just
[1:04:37] as bad
[1:04:38] on the one side it's just as bad to have
[1:04:40] your head full
[1:04:41] to know all these things not not bad to
[1:04:44] know
[1:04:45] we want to know we want to know the
[1:04:47] truth but what's bad is when you begin
[1:04:49] building up an
[1:04:50] arrogant complex when you begin thinking
[1:04:51] that thinking that you're somebody
[1:04:53] because of something
[1:04:54] or on the other side when you go maybe
[1:04:56] to a camp meeting and you run through
[1:04:58] the congregation and
[1:04:59] and the spirit falls because you
[1:05:01] preached or something and then you begin
[1:05:02] to say well look how spiritual i am
[1:05:05] look look how spiritual i am when i
[1:05:06] preach all these young people come to
[1:05:08] the altar
[1:05:09] when i preach the spirit of god falls
[1:05:10] and now behold
[1:05:12] behold the workmanship of my ability i'm
[1:05:14] a great man i'm a great preacher or
[1:05:16] whatever whatever it might be
[1:05:18] i'm more spiritual than somebody else
[1:05:20] and you begin to get further and further
[1:05:21] away from god on either way that you
[1:05:23] look at and that's the devil the devil
[1:05:25] trying to convince you
[1:05:26] that you're already full that you don't
[1:05:28] need nothing else
[1:05:29] but what i want to convince you of this
[1:05:31] afternoon is if you come with empty
[1:05:33] vessels god will fill you
[1:05:34] up he'll fill you up to where you get
[1:05:36] rid of all that pride
[1:05:38] and all the arrogance and you're able to
[1:05:40] fellowship with other people
[1:05:41] you're able to get around other people
[1:05:42] because the pride and the arrogance has
[1:05:44] gone
[1:05:45] he said but the thing of it is the thing
[1:05:47] of it is having nothing that you can
[1:05:49] depend
[1:05:50] on in your own self or anything that you
[1:05:53] can do
[1:05:54] just a complete total surrender of your
[1:05:56] weaknesses unto god and say
[1:05:58] here i am here i am having nothing no
[1:06:01] ability that you can trust in
[1:06:03] no ability that you can trust in he said
[1:06:06] some people
[1:06:07] some people as soon as they become
[1:06:09] christians they become arrogant
[1:06:12] indifferent and different that's right
[1:06:14] when they're just taking a vice versa of
[1:06:15] the path arrogant
[1:06:16] is when is when you you begin to get
[1:06:18] lifted up within yourself and
[1:06:20] and you don't want to fellowship with
[1:06:21] people you don't want to talk you start
[1:06:22] looking down at people
[1:06:24] you start doing like we'll get to it in
[1:06:25] a second like paul before he was
[1:06:27] converted
[1:06:27] he was squashing the wrong thing he
[1:06:29] wanted to smash the weak
[1:06:31] he wanted to smash the weak people
[1:06:33] smashed the wrong
[1:06:34] thing so when you get er brother said
[1:06:37] get
[1:06:37] small stay humble keep your eyes on god
[1:06:41] just keep your eyes right on god and
[1:06:43] stay as small as you can
[1:06:47] now paul brother was using paul as an
[1:06:50] example
[1:06:52] there in first corinthians chapter two
[1:06:53] verse one he said this man
[1:06:55] this man paul was trained this man was
[1:06:58] trained he could speak he said he could
[1:07:00] speak near
[1:07:01] pretty near any language there was in
[1:07:02] the world he had to brag about it he was
[1:07:05] brought up under the strict sect of the
[1:07:07] pharisees and his father was a pharisees
[1:07:09] later he was a pharisee of the fair
[1:07:11] season that means that he was
[1:07:12] absolutely the strictest of the
[1:07:14] pharisees he was a great fellow
[1:07:16] he was he was he was good he was he was
[1:07:19] great
[1:07:20] and he had authority and he was smart
[1:07:23] his father had given him an education
[1:07:24] under the best teacher there was in all
[1:07:26] the land
[1:07:27] abundantly the best teacher that there
[1:07:29] was gamaliel
[1:07:31] at that time the most notable teacher of
[1:07:33] any of the schools
[1:07:34] so he had been taught really well he
[1:07:36] knew in other words he knew
[1:07:38] the doctrine paul became become that
[1:07:41] type of a man he learned every language
[1:07:43] he learned psychology he learned all the
[1:07:46] different things that there he is in to
[1:07:48] be learned that way
[1:07:49] and he said now brother brown said this
[1:07:51] he said listen to this same man with all
[1:07:53] this education
[1:07:54] after he had received christ listen to
[1:07:56] what he said how strong and great he was
[1:07:58] he had to forget it he had to realize
[1:08:00] that he could not depend upon himself he
[1:08:03] could not depend
[1:08:04] upon all that learning that he had to
[1:08:06] correctly interpret the word
[1:08:08] he could not depend upon all that
[1:08:10] gamaliel had taught to correctly
[1:08:12] identify
[1:08:13] the the risen christ he had to realize
[1:08:16] that he could not depend upon himself
[1:08:18] he had to realize that his education was
[1:08:20] nothing
[1:08:21] all of that background all the fact that
[1:08:23] he had learned all those languages
[1:08:24] all that he had to deny and now listen
[1:08:26] in first corinthians chapter two
[1:08:28] verse one to five how paul approached
[1:08:30] the corinthian church
[1:08:32] paul approached him like this and he
[1:08:33] said and i brethren when i came to you
[1:08:36] came not with excellency of speech or of
[1:08:38] wisdom in other words not with my own
[1:08:40] ability that i got from gamaliel
[1:08:42] in other words he's coming with a
[1:08:43] revelation directly from jesus christ
[1:08:46] for that age
[1:08:47] he's coming with a predestinated word
[1:08:49] for that day not because he got a lot of
[1:08:51] education
[1:08:52] not because he got he got it all a good
[1:08:54] schooling
[1:08:55] declaring unto you the testimony of god
[1:08:57] for i determine
[1:08:59] not to know anything among you look how
[1:09:02] weirdly this is worded for i determine
[1:09:04] not to know
[1:09:05] anything among you saved jesus christ
[1:09:08] and him crucified
[1:09:09] he's speaking to a group of people that
[1:09:11] say he's looking at them with all their
[1:09:12] problems
[1:09:13] and all their weaknesses and all their
[1:09:15] failings and all of their background
[1:09:17] that many of them came out of the
[1:09:18] gentiles and many of them came out
[1:09:20] out of rough backgrounds and stuff but
[1:09:22] he's saying that don't matter to me
[1:09:24] i want to see nothing in you i don't
[1:09:26] want to see your background
[1:09:27] i don't want to see all your intellect
[1:09:28] or your ability i don't want to see
[1:09:30] nothing but jesus christ in you
[1:09:32] hey listen i believe that's what brother
[1:09:34] dale's been trying to get into this all
[1:09:35] these years as he's trying to get all of
[1:09:37] our own ability baked out of us
[1:09:39] he's trying to get our own self baked
[1:09:41] out so that nothing is left but jesus
[1:09:43] christ
[1:09:44] so that we're not relying on our own
[1:09:46] selves to preach the gospel
[1:09:47] so that we're not relying on our own
[1:09:48] ability to live the gospel
[1:09:51] but nothing he said i'm determined to
[1:09:53] know nothing about your abilities
[1:09:55] right i know that this is brother brown
[1:09:57] i'm explaining this scripture i know
[1:09:58] that there's nothing in you
[1:10:00] and i'm only determined that i know that
[1:10:02] there's nothing in you
[1:10:04] i know that there's nothing in you
[1:10:06] nothing good of in you
[1:10:08] and i'm only determined to know one
[1:10:10] thing that i see in you that's jesus
[1:10:11] christ and him crucified
[1:10:14] the crucified savior among you that's
[1:10:16] all i'm going to recognize
[1:10:18] all i'm going to recognize as jesus
[1:10:20] christ in you not your abilities
[1:10:22] not your own strengths and he said he
[1:10:25] said and i was with you in weakness and
[1:10:27] in fear and in much trembling and my
[1:10:28] speech and my preaching
[1:10:30] was not with enticing words of man's
[1:10:32] wisdom
[1:10:33] not with a lot of good intellectual
[1:10:35] teaching that came from gamalie or from
[1:10:36] the schooling from the
[1:10:38] from the the the what he had got growing
[1:10:41] up
[1:10:42] but in the demonstration of the spirit
[1:10:44] and power
[1:10:45] the demonstration of the spirit of god
[1:10:47] actually quickening the word
[1:10:49] and making it live that your faith
[1:10:51] should not stand in the wisdom of men
[1:10:53] but in the power of god now look the
[1:10:56] reason brother branham said that he was
[1:10:57] fearing that he said i'm come to you
[1:10:59] in fear he said the reason he was
[1:11:02] fearing not because he was scared of
[1:11:04] anything
[1:11:05] but he was scared that he would
[1:11:06] displease god in some way
[1:11:08] that he'd get his own ability mixed up
[1:11:11] into it
[1:11:12] something that he learned oh imagine him
[1:11:14] coming to the corinthians and thinking
[1:11:16] my
[1:11:16] what if i get something that gamaliel
[1:11:19] taught me
[1:11:20] that was off the word mixed up in here
[1:11:22] and they were looking at that
[1:11:24] instead of the true power of the gospel
[1:11:26] what if i get something
[1:11:28] something even within my own self mixed
[1:11:29] up in here but i i
[1:11:31] listen to get to get uh people
[1:11:34] ready so that there's nothing in them
[1:11:36] but god it takes a pure
[1:11:38] unadulterated word without any any kind
[1:11:41] of man's involvement that
[1:11:43] where i started off in this message with
[1:11:45] the altar call will get messed up when
[1:11:47] man messes with it
[1:11:49] anything will get any move will get
[1:11:50] messed up when man begins to inject
[1:11:52] their own ideas
[1:11:54] and you see that's what paul was afraid
[1:11:55] of he came to them with fear
[1:11:57] afraid that he would get his own self in
[1:11:59] the way inject his own ideas
[1:12:02] and his own complexes and maybe throw in
[1:12:04] a little a little bitter jab at a roman
[1:12:06] soldier or something that had done
[1:12:07] something wrong to him
[1:12:09] it's got to come you are what you eat
[1:12:11] and the pure word if we preach only
[1:12:13] christ in him crucified
[1:12:15] we will become only christ and him
[1:12:17] crucified
[1:12:19] amen he said i come to you in fear that
[1:12:22] i would come that way
[1:12:23] but i come to you knowing nothing but
[1:12:25] christ and him crucified what that means
[1:12:27] what that means is that no psychology no
[1:12:31] psychology being preached no church
[1:12:32] gossip no parables from the world no
[1:12:35] no movie references just the word of god
[1:12:37] only no preaching about his own weakness
[1:12:40] in other words not preaching from his
[1:12:41] own bitterness or ready to come and
[1:12:43] attack somebody
[1:12:44] no bitterness from things people say no
[1:12:46] messages rooted in
[1:12:47] his own complexes his own failings
[1:12:50] wondering if people's listening to him
[1:12:52] if we can just get out and get all that
[1:12:53] stuff out of the way then god believe
[1:12:55] god can do something no
[1:12:56] no revenge messages no revenge messages
[1:12:59] of coming up to attack somebody because
[1:13:01] they didn't like something because paul
[1:13:03] said i determined
[1:13:05] i determined not to know anything among
[1:13:08] you
[1:13:08] nothing among you saved jesus christ and
[1:13:11] him crucified
[1:13:12] that was his objective is to see nothing
[1:13:14] in the people of the
[1:13:15] corinthians except jesus christ and him
[1:13:17] and him crucified
[1:13:18] and brother ram said listen to this man
[1:13:21] listen to this man who was a warrior who
[1:13:22] had stripped himself
[1:13:24] if there's anything that our schools
[1:13:26] needs today if it's anything our
[1:13:27] churches needs today it's a stripping of
[1:13:29] themselves
[1:13:30] of your own thoughts and your own
[1:13:31] abilities strip yourselves before god
[1:13:34] unless you would try to do something
[1:13:36] within yourselves he said you've got to
[1:13:39] become
[1:13:39] nothing not a know-it-all not a great
[1:13:42] somebody but a nobody
[1:13:44] you got to come dust you've got to get
[1:13:48] to a place that you
[1:13:49] know that you're nothing i don't never
[1:13:52] rise above it
[1:13:53] now listen for as soon as you rise above
[1:13:55] it as soon as you rise above it you rise
[1:13:58] above god
[1:13:59] as soon as you begin to think that you
[1:14:01] have some special importance or you have
[1:14:03] some special ability within yourself
[1:14:05] you're rising above god
[1:14:07] he said you've got to keep yourself in
[1:14:08] the dust and on the
[1:14:10] road to damascus you've got to keep
[1:14:13] yourself off your
[1:14:14] high horses when i when i get everything
[1:14:17] out of me brother brown said then god
[1:14:18] can come in
[1:14:19] but as long as i got some of myself
[1:14:21] there then god
[1:14:23] can't get in and he said now
[1:14:26] now let's dwell on paul a little bit
[1:14:27] more he said this great fellow paul he
[1:14:30] was a prince among the preachers
[1:14:32] he was respected by every denomination
[1:14:35] that man could have went to a city and
[1:14:37] had a meeting anywhere because
[1:14:39] why because he had credentials now see
[1:14:42] it matters where you got your
[1:14:43] credentials from he had credentials from
[1:14:45] from his learning and from his
[1:14:46] background and from his education from
[1:14:48] his own ability
[1:14:49] but the credentials that come from a
[1:14:50] christian come from god come from the
[1:14:52] power of the holy ghost
[1:14:54] he said he was so great and so
[1:14:55] determined to smash out all the people
[1:14:57] that was weak
[1:14:58] smash out the weak smashing out the weak
[1:15:00] see see you've got to be so careful who
[1:15:02] you smash
[1:15:03] but paul was smashing the ones that that
[1:15:05] god wanted to work through he was
[1:15:07] smashing the ones that were weak
[1:15:09] now these are brother brown's words that
[1:15:10] he smashed the weak
[1:15:12] smashing the weak because they have a
[1:15:14] background of sin we don't smash people
[1:15:15] because they got a background
[1:15:17] because they got a torah background we
[1:15:18] don't smash people because they maybe
[1:15:20] they don't believe
[1:15:21] like we do we don't smash people because
[1:15:23] they somebody struggles with theology
[1:15:25] and they're having a hard time
[1:15:26] but you see that's that's who god works
[1:15:28] through somebody that can barely
[1:15:29] understand
[1:15:30] somebody who's having troubles he said
[1:15:33] he was binding the christians but notice
[1:15:35] him he had to
[1:15:35] become bound himself so he could lose it
[1:15:39] he could lose his strength and authority
[1:15:43] and then we go on to moses brother i
[1:15:46] said we know he was strong and well
[1:15:48] trained
[1:15:49] and and he said seeing the need of the
[1:15:51] day moses with his intellectual powers
[1:15:53] and his ability that he had to do it
[1:15:55] with he was a smart man
[1:15:56] he was the coming pharaoh he had
[1:15:58] psychology he had power
[1:16:00] he had physical strength he had
[1:16:02] everything so he said
[1:16:03] i'm well equipped i know all of it and
[1:16:05] if there's a man in the land that's able
[1:16:07] to do what i am
[1:16:08] if there's somebody that's able to do it
[1:16:10] i am and brother brahma said he couldn't
[1:16:11] use it then neither can he now
[1:16:13] god cannot use our natural abilities he
[1:16:16] said i can quote that bible with my eyes
[1:16:18] closed and god can't use a bit of that
[1:16:20] if somebody were to say that that i can
[1:16:22] quote that bible with my eyes closed
[1:16:24] god can't use a bit of that but he said
[1:16:26] one thing that moses had going for him
[1:16:28] was he recognized when he was licked
[1:16:31] he recognized when he come to a place
[1:16:33] and that's what that's what that's what
[1:16:35] the back side of the desert your
[1:16:36] backside of the desert experiences for
[1:16:38] is to get you to a place to realize that
[1:16:40] there's no inability in yourself that
[1:16:42] you can't do it of your own self
[1:16:44] to realize that that you can't do it to
[1:16:46] realize that you're weak and and
[1:16:48] in this sermon brother branham outlined
[1:16:49] the six weaknesses that moses had
[1:16:52] and he said he said he said moses came
[1:16:54] to god and he said lord i ain't no good
[1:16:56] now how many of us have said that before
[1:16:58] i ain't no good see that's when god is
[1:17:00] getting you to a place to realize
[1:17:02] that that you can't do it on your own
[1:17:05] lord i ain't no good i ain't no good of
[1:17:08] my own self and he said i can't speak
[1:17:10] i can't speak i can't talk right there's
[1:17:12] something i
[1:17:13] i don't have any kind of ability within
[1:17:15] myself how am i supposed to speak
[1:17:17] and and then he'd go back to his
[1:17:18] background well i slew an egyptian
[1:17:20] i killed somebody i don't think there's
[1:17:22] anybody in here that's got a backstory
[1:17:25] that bad
[1:17:25] i killed somebody and you see none of
[1:17:28] that none of that mattered to god
[1:17:29] because
[1:17:30] god was able to take that and patch it
[1:17:32] all up fix it up and put god and put
[1:17:34] moses into service
[1:17:35] sure he had killed somebody and moses
[1:17:38] said i i can't go back i can't go back
[1:17:40] to where i came from that's the same
[1:17:41] story that the little woman that came in
[1:17:43] and and washed jesus feet with her tears
[1:17:45] said when she broke that glass of
[1:17:47] ointment
[1:17:47] there was no going back for a refund at
[1:17:49] that point there's no going back
[1:17:51] there's no going back only going forward
[1:17:54] he said i can't go back
[1:17:55] they won't receive me they won't receive
[1:17:57] me with my message
[1:17:58] how many times how many times has
[1:18:00] ministers thought that maybe in your
[1:18:01] private hours they i might i might
[1:18:03] start preaching and nobody will nobody
[1:18:04] will want to hear me it falls on deaf
[1:18:07] ears nobody will receive me but that's
[1:18:08] the weakness that god wants to work
[1:18:10] through
[1:18:11] weakness where you can't do it of your
[1:18:12] own self he said and he said i got no
[1:18:14] message in other words i don't know what
[1:18:16] to say
[1:18:17] how am i supposed to know what to say
[1:18:19] how are you supposed to know what to say
[1:18:21] because we got a prophet that came and
[1:18:22] told us what the true interpretation of
[1:18:24] the word is
[1:18:25] he told us he told he said everything he
[1:18:27] gave us a message of what the true
[1:18:29] what god we should serve that there's
[1:18:31] one god he gave us the understanding of
[1:18:33] how to be baptized and how to live a
[1:18:34] good christian life and and how
[1:18:36] there's no ability within your own self
[1:18:38] which is what i'm preaching tonight
[1:18:40] and you say i got no message but god is
[1:18:42] able to give you one
[1:18:43] god is able to give you the truth the
[1:18:44] true understanding and see brother i
[1:18:46] said to see how he was he was nothing
[1:18:49] he was nothing he had been a brother he
[1:18:51] had been cured
[1:18:52] you realize that's what your backside of
[1:18:54] the desert experience is for when you
[1:18:56] feel like everybody's hating on you and
[1:18:58] and everybody's just using you at church
[1:19:00] maybe nobody's giving nobody's putting
[1:19:02] you on a pedestal nobody's giving you
[1:19:04] maybe the time of day maybe nobody's
[1:19:06] shaking your hand the way that you think
[1:19:07] that
[1:19:08] and you're going through a back side of
[1:19:09] the desert experience to get good and
[1:19:11] cured just like moses was
[1:19:13] you're that man that's when god is
[1:19:15] really doing something
[1:19:16] when you're going through that curing
[1:19:18] process and you come out and you realize
[1:19:20] that maybe you ain't as big as you
[1:19:22] thought you were and then that's right
[1:19:23] when god can get a hold of you and do
[1:19:25] something
[1:19:26] do something in your life he said yeah
[1:19:29] god could use him then after he was
[1:19:30] cured he said did god feel sorry for
[1:19:33] moses with all of his weaknesses say
[1:19:35] poor little
[1:19:36] poor little moses something sure has
[1:19:38] happened to you you fell from your
[1:19:40] degree he said no
[1:19:41] no he was a little bit upset with him
[1:19:43] and he said brother brahma said don't
[1:19:44] expect pity from god when you've come
[1:19:46] through your wilderness experience
[1:19:48] and maybe had everybody been treating
[1:19:50] you wrong and he said don't expect pity
[1:19:52] after going through your backside of the
[1:19:53] desert experience
[1:19:55] god because then right then is when god
[1:19:57] can do something
[1:19:58] amen right moses getting cured up god
[1:20:02] could use it
[1:20:03] and then jacob jacob wrestling he come
[1:20:06] to
[1:20:07] you know how many times brother branham
[1:20:08] would use jacob as a as a type
[1:20:10] of somebody that was born again and then
[1:20:13] coming to their place in their life
[1:20:15] coming at that place crossing over ready
[1:20:17] to meet esau
[1:20:18] realizing that they needed something
[1:20:20] else and you see
[1:20:21] jacob who had the birthright come to a
[1:20:23] place he was walking on brother brown
[1:20:25] was using this as an example he said
[1:20:27] he come to that place where all of his
[1:20:29] family he sent all of his family on and
[1:20:31] there he was all
[1:20:32] alone at the crossing over place ready
[1:20:34] to go over to meet esau and esau and
[1:20:36] then he began to be afraid
[1:20:38] of death he began to be afraid that he
[1:20:40] was going to die and he began to realize
[1:20:42] that he needed something else and he
[1:20:45] began to empty
[1:20:46] out and that's when he had their
[1:20:47] experience wrestling with the angel
[1:20:49] i i i maybe would just want to get it
[1:20:51] get across to you
[1:20:52] pay attention to how brother branham
[1:20:54] explained the experience wrestling with
[1:20:56] the angel
[1:20:57] it's so different maybe than a lot of
[1:20:58] times we think about it he said
[1:21:00] oh god let the church get like that get
[1:21:03] to the church to a place where it can't
[1:21:05] hold on
[1:21:05] any longer with its natural abilities
[1:21:09] but has to give over to god now see who
[1:21:12] was jacob really wrestling with he's
[1:21:14] he's wrestling with the angel
[1:21:16] he's wrestling to get rid of his own
[1:21:18] abilities when he comes to the place
[1:21:20] where he
[1:21:20] knows that he can't do it of it on his
[1:21:22] own self then he just gives it over to
[1:21:24] god
[1:21:25] and he conquers he's able to overcome
[1:21:28] able to overcome by just giving in and
[1:21:30] letting god take over
[1:21:32] a lot of times we see we wrestle we
[1:21:33] wrestle within ourselves because we
[1:21:35] think
[1:21:35] that there's some innate ability within
[1:21:37] ourselves to overcome
[1:21:39] some ability within ourselves to get rid
[1:21:41] of the vaping or to get rid of the
[1:21:42] cigarette smoking or to get rid of
[1:21:44] the pot smoking or to get rid of the
[1:21:46] drinking or to get rid of whatever it is
[1:21:48] as you move up the statue of a perfect
[1:21:49] man to get rid of all those things
[1:21:51] and to see the devil leaving you to see
[1:21:53] the devil getting away from you
[1:21:55] there's no ina ability in you at all
[1:21:57] there's nothing within yourself at all
[1:21:59] it all comes from god
[1:22:01] if you can just give in and let god take
[1:22:03] over you see that's
[1:22:04] many times that's our problem with our
[1:22:06] kids as we think that somehow we can say
[1:22:09] the right thing to our family
[1:22:10] or the right thing to our kids but if
[1:22:12] you'll just give it over to god like
[1:22:14] moses mama did when she put him in the
[1:22:16] bull rushing just turn him loose
[1:22:17] and say god you take over you take over
[1:22:20] while he's going through the crocodiles
[1:22:21] and passed all the hippos and everything
[1:22:23] you take over then watch god actually
[1:22:25] perform a miracle
[1:22:27] watch god do something i i so
[1:22:29] appreciated brother luis's testimony the
[1:22:31] other night by about his prayer because
[1:22:33] i i have i've seen that as well in my
[1:22:35] own life listen if you put something
[1:22:37] before god in prayer and
[1:22:38] and just say i can't do it i can't do it
[1:22:41] anymore
[1:22:42] you're gonna have to do something you
[1:22:43] watch and see if god will not come by
[1:22:45] whether you lost your keys or your
[1:22:47] wallet or you lost your kids or you lost
[1:22:49] your loved ones or your parents or
[1:22:50] whatever it is
[1:22:51] watch watch and see if god won't come on
[1:22:53] the scene
[1:22:54] why because it's you're surrendering
[1:22:56] your own ability you're coming to a
[1:22:57] place where i know that i can't do it
[1:22:59] and i got to rely on somebody that's got
[1:23:01] strength
[1:23:03] see brother brown said it was then that
[1:23:04] jacob become a prince of god
[1:23:06] the bible said he'd become a prince and
[1:23:08] his name was changed
[1:23:10] and he was a strong man on this side
[1:23:12] intellectually powerful
[1:23:13] but on the other side on the other side
[1:23:15] he was a limping prince
[1:23:17] weak and wore down but add power before
[1:23:20] god my
[1:23:21] that's a paradox now right to think of a
[1:23:23] man
[1:23:24] you talk you're talking about coming to
[1:23:25] adoption and coming to hear your hem
[1:23:27] conditions
[1:23:27] and coming to a place where god can use
[1:23:29] you but what what would that look like
[1:23:31] what would it look like on the outside
[1:23:33] what it looked like jesus on the cross
[1:23:35] dying coming to a place where he had
[1:23:37] given everything over what it looked
[1:23:38] like peter who was cross
[1:23:40] crucified upside down when it looked
[1:23:41] like somebody that had given their whole
[1:23:43] life over brother branham who
[1:23:44] everybody had left him and left him
[1:23:46] deserted preaching in a little mobile
[1:23:47] home
[1:23:48] nobody listening to him it seemed like
[1:23:50] anymore until he died killed by a drunk
[1:23:52] driver and it looked like
[1:23:53] he had died in weakness but he died in
[1:23:55] power
[1:23:56] his life was lived under the strength
[1:23:58] and the power of the gospel
[1:24:00] many times you see god is looking for a
[1:24:02] weak vessel a weak empty vessel that he
[1:24:04] can work through somebody that will
[1:24:06] yield themselves to him
[1:24:07] he said let the angel get a hold of you
[1:24:09] one time the angel of the lord that'll
[1:24:11] bring you the truth of the message
[1:24:13] let him get a hold of you one time
[1:24:14] you'll humble right down to the baptism
[1:24:16] in jesus name
[1:24:17] you'll humble right down to all the rest
[1:24:19] of it if you'll just give it over to
[1:24:21] give it over to god and let god move and
[1:24:24] do through you as he will
[1:24:26] and david david the poorest excuse there
[1:24:28] was on the field to go father to
[1:24:30] favor david the the eighth child after
[1:24:32] after all those seven church age after
[1:24:34] all the
[1:24:35] the church ages had gone through and
[1:24:37] finally there's a little one that
[1:24:38] everybody had neglected somebody a
[1:24:40] little smaller group of people
[1:24:42] that is willing to fulfill the word of
[1:24:43] god that everybody had overlooked
[1:24:45] that david's own dad had overlooked that
[1:24:47] even the prophet
[1:24:48] the prophet had overlooked the prophet
[1:24:50] came to anoint him and he's like
[1:24:51] uh well you know what i i don't know
[1:24:54] what to do it didn't seem like any
[1:24:56] any of the ones that would be acceptable
[1:24:57] of god were present there all the big
[1:25:00] ones all the strong ones but god
[1:25:02] selected the weakest
[1:25:03] the weakest out of all of them and i'm
[1:25:05] kind of i'm kind of hurrying through my
[1:25:07] notes here
[1:25:08] but and david came david came to goliath
[1:25:10] brother brown
[1:25:11] said with a raisin pie in his hand for
[1:25:13] his brother a little raisin pie in his
[1:25:15] hand
[1:25:15] and he didn't come with a sword and he
[1:25:17] had no had no use for the
[1:25:18] for the all the armor that saul had but
[1:25:20] he came well he picked up the weakest
[1:25:23] weakest most miserable looking weapon
[1:25:25] that you could find on the battlefield
[1:25:27] a little sling that he could twirl
[1:25:29] around and instead of picking up
[1:25:31] a like a trebuchet or a catapult or
[1:25:33] something he picked up little five
[1:25:34] little stones
[1:25:36] listen that's all you need to overcome
[1:25:38] you don't need any of your own abilities
[1:25:40] you don't need any of your own strength
[1:25:42] all you have to have is
[1:25:43] f-a-i-t-h and j-e-s-u-s and you can
[1:25:46] overcome
[1:25:46] everything every goliath that the devil
[1:25:49] throws at you in your life
[1:25:52] he said all he wanted he said i got my
[1:25:54] trust in god and here i go that's
[1:25:56] it and the giant went down the giant
[1:25:58] went down with the weakest the weakest
[1:26:00] out of all his brethren the weakest out
[1:26:02] of all of israel
[1:26:03] with the weakest weapon that he could
[1:26:05] possibly have chosen
[1:26:06] with no armor on because all he had he
[1:26:09] put
[1:26:09] everything every ability was was just
[1:26:12] thrown on god
[1:26:13] he stripped himself before god he had
[1:26:15] stripped himself and called himself
[1:26:17] unworthy
[1:26:18] willing realizing that he had no ability
[1:26:21] to himself
[1:26:22] brother bryan said we need a david
[1:26:23] untrained in the theological schools
[1:26:25] we need a man who knows nothing about
[1:26:27] that some little plow boy or something
[1:26:30] some little guy with his stooped
[1:26:31] shoulders not much to look at will come
[1:26:34] walking down the road
[1:26:35] with the power of god you see we've got
[1:26:38] victory through weakness
[1:26:40] we've got victory through weak weakness
[1:26:42] paul paul
[1:26:43] sitting there in a jail cell with with
[1:26:45] 39 stripes across his back with he
[1:26:47] brother brown said with tears scalding
[1:26:49] his eyes until he couldn't see no more
[1:26:51] he couldn't see with his natural eye but
[1:26:53] he could see a crown of righteousness
[1:26:55] laid up beyond her
[1:26:56] brother brown said his ankles were wore
[1:26:58] out and fell off so much from the all
[1:27:00] the molded bread they throw it in the
[1:27:01] air
[1:27:02] his weak he just got weak from all the
[1:27:04] molded bread and he couldn't hardly
[1:27:06] hold himself up and the rats were
[1:27:08] running all over him and spiders and
[1:27:10] things
[1:27:11] but he was looking at that crown of
[1:27:13] righteousness
[1:27:16] that's why first corinthians chapter 15
[1:27:18] says the old death where is thy sting o
[1:27:19] grave where is thy victory
[1:27:21] when death come at him when death was
[1:27:23] right there at the door he was not
[1:27:25] looking at his own abilities but he was
[1:27:26] looking at a prize that was laid up for
[1:27:28] him
[1:27:29] and elisha elijah after he had combed
[1:27:32] through brother ramsay combed through
[1:27:34] all the people until preaching that hard
[1:27:36] message until there was hardly anybody
[1:27:38] left
[1:27:38] to listen to him anymore they didn't
[1:27:40] want to sit and listen to that hard
[1:27:41] message being preached
[1:27:43] comb through until until there was just
[1:27:45] nobody left
[1:27:46] how he calmed them and they all just
[1:27:48] kept falling away
[1:27:49] till there was nobody and then when he
[1:27:51] got weak didn't become strong
[1:27:53] that's when brother brown said he gave
[1:27:55] him a new message
[1:27:57] he gave him a new message when he got
[1:27:59] weak when he got to the point he said
[1:28:01] now now you go tell
[1:28:05] the tell the king he said go down there
[1:28:07] and tell that hypocrite thus saith the
[1:28:09] lord they'll not even be do
[1:28:10] fall from heaven till i call for it when
[1:28:13] he became weak
[1:28:14] when he realized that when it within his
[1:28:16] own self there was no ability
[1:28:18] then he then god gave took him up on the
[1:28:20] mountaintop to show him something
[1:28:24] and then i'll be closing in just a
[1:28:26] second now now how about
[1:28:27] how about that widow with a handful of
[1:28:29] meal there in second kings chapter four
[1:28:32] when she got to her weakness she had you
[1:28:34] see she had a debt to pay off and she
[1:28:35] couldn't pay that debt off
[1:28:37] and they were going to come take her two
[1:28:38] sons away and elisha
[1:28:40] now brother branham in this sermon he
[1:28:41] says elijah but it was elisha in the
[1:28:43] bible elisha that was that was coming to
[1:28:45] this little widow woman
[1:28:46] and he said she she got to her weakness
[1:28:49] she
[1:28:49] she'd probably starved herself to death
[1:28:51] she had no meal and a lot of
[1:28:53] elijah said you've got what have you got
[1:28:55] in your house just a little oil and a
[1:28:57] vessel
[1:28:58] just a little oil and he said go to your
[1:29:00] neighbors and borrow plenty of them get
[1:29:02] all the empty vessels that you can
[1:29:04] bring all the empty vessels and then
[1:29:06] you're going to see god do something
[1:29:07] when you bring all the empty vessels
[1:29:10] he said they're look getting ready
[1:29:12] before it even happens get ready
[1:29:13] david heard that sound in the morbid but
[1:29:15] she was getting ready she was going
[1:29:17] around
[1:29:17] bringing me your empty vessels because
[1:29:19] the prophet of god told me that i'll
[1:29:21] bring my empty vessels
[1:29:22] then something's gonna happen and she
[1:29:24] began to go get ready
[1:29:26] if you'll get ready then get ready how
[1:29:28] do you get ready by emptying yourself
[1:29:30] out
[1:29:31] get ready before you come to church if
[1:29:33] you'll get rid of it before you take
[1:29:34] communion get rid of all that pride
[1:29:37] go pray up before god and get every get
[1:29:39] ready because god then you'll see god do
[1:29:41] something for you
[1:29:42] he said elijah saw a cloud just the size
[1:29:44] of a hand if god could only get some
[1:29:46] empty vessels that's right he said fill
[1:29:48] the house full of them
[1:29:50] fill the house full of them see what god
[1:29:52] wants god's got to have
[1:29:53] empty vessels there's only one thing
[1:29:56] left to do turn to god and his word and
[1:29:59] if you'll do that
[1:30:00] get some empty vessels take out all the
[1:30:02] methodists out of them all the
[1:30:04] pentecostal out of them
[1:30:05] all the baptists out of them and and
[1:30:07] just let them be vessels and set them up
[1:30:09] in the house in other words if you can
[1:30:11] get rid of all
[1:30:11] your ideas about how things should be
[1:30:14] all your pride
[1:30:15] all of your enmity just get rid of
[1:30:17] everything and just lay it before god
[1:30:19] lay whatever the situation is before god
[1:30:21] and say
[1:30:22] i'm coming empty i'm coming and i
[1:30:24] believe the prophet told me that just
[1:30:26] like that little widow woman the prophet
[1:30:28] told me if i would get my vessel
[1:30:29] and just empty out myself that you'll
[1:30:32] fill it up
[1:30:32] he said god send us a prophet that will
[1:30:35] take the word of god
[1:30:36] that will not take something else but
[1:30:38] just get empty vessels
[1:30:40] if god can just get empty vessels and
[1:30:42] then take the word of god
[1:30:44] and pour it into the person not some say
[1:30:46] oh i shook when i received that i spoke
[1:30:48] in tongues when i received it i danced
[1:30:50] in the spirit
[1:30:51] forget it just stay there until it comes
[1:30:54] that's all till the vessel's full
[1:30:56] that's it that's the way you do it yes
[1:30:58] sir the simplicity of it
[1:31:00] the vessels was filled up why because
[1:31:03] she did what the prophet told her to do
[1:31:05] she brought those empty vessels and and
[1:31:07] just abated he said
[1:31:09] he said if you can come if you can come
[1:31:11] just based on
[1:31:12] one word of god just based on nothing
[1:31:15] now listen to how simple this is just
[1:31:16] just with nothing else no other
[1:31:18] understanding we think a lot of times
[1:31:20] you've got to come with
[1:31:21] you can't get nothing until you
[1:31:22] understand daniel 70 weeks and the seven
[1:31:24] seals
[1:31:25] but brother branham said i can just take
[1:31:27] one little scripture acts 2 38 and
[1:31:29] that's all we need
[1:31:31] just obey that repent every one of you
[1:31:34] and be baptized in the name of jesus
[1:31:36] christ
[1:31:36] for the remission of your sins and you
[1:31:38] shall be filled up with the oil
[1:31:40] and you shall be filled and listen to
[1:31:41] the way he explained that you add to
[1:31:42] that drop
[1:31:43] another drop and it keeps dropping in
[1:31:45] drop drop drop until you get full
[1:31:48] full that's all you need to come and
[1:31:50] then you just keep adding to that add
[1:31:52] and add
[1:31:52] little drops one drop at a time and he
[1:31:54] said that's the drop that peter used on
[1:31:56] the day of pentecost
[1:31:58] that's the drop that paul used that's
[1:31:59] the drop that all the disciples used
[1:32:01] the rest of it will be added you just
[1:32:03] take that drop and follow that true and
