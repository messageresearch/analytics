Description:
JOHN 14:1-11
»     1     †      ¶  Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.
»     2     †     In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.
»     3     †     And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.
»     4     †      ¶  And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.
»     5     †     Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way? 
»     6     †     Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.
»     7     †     If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.
»     8     †     Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us. 
»     9     †     Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father? 
»     10     †     Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.
»     11     †     Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake.

»     20     †     At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.
»     21     †     He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.

amen never get tired of that song cuz it's our it's our theme Open the Eyes of our heart good to be in the house of the Lord good to see each and every one of you good to be back among the living boy just a bunch of dead people out there this is the only live people there is sometimes we feel sometimes we feel dead but we're not and I love that song that that Louise sang there I like that that worship song I I told him this morning I down at Sunday school class that uh Louise sent us that song uh to practice and and and June helped singing and US helped sing and all that you know Cu uh so June this morning we were all I was humming enter in Into the Heart of Worship and June was singing I enter into the Heart of Worship and everything was good she walked out of the bedroom and we've got two rabbits and they were fighting each other and she was we enter into the heart of worship y'all stop what you doing now stop it we enter into the stop now I mean stop it I said that is a true mama your mama can beat you and sing worship songs at the same time sister Anna come on back there worshiping God and she got that spoon about that oh we're just humans I told them this morning I I said you know as we progress up the statue of a perfect man I think we what we want what we want is everybody to change to the way we want them to change I'm not going to ever get silent sorry it's just not in me it's not part of me God likes me this way whether you do or Not So today we're going to uh continue our thought on on uh the son of man and today we're going to uh try to just go through scripture we're not going to read any quotes we're just going to go through scripture and and um maybe show a little that's why I was saying that the reason I said what I said is that we thought we think that when the son of man came on Earth which is God Almighty in human flesh that he walked that he walked so much like God well he did but it was so different that the the people the people around him he was so normal till remember they didn't even uh in his own found he couldn't do Mighty Works cuz they thought oh that's Joseph's son or that oh he's just that's just Jesus you see what I'm saying so I don't think we're going towards superhuman we're human we proved that last night and y'all need to pray for Gabby and Ryan and I mean I know they got four children but they sure need to talk to each other cuz they uh they didn't get much done last night as far as answering questions about their uh about their s so just be but now Louis and Christine they won last night they won uh they won the gift certificate cuz they they got the most points and we just try to have a good good fun you really do find out who knows who knows about what about your spouse so uh we thank the Lord for for brother Dell and sister Dell for for paying for the thing and letting us come and uh and all the great things that that were that went on and surely I told uh U we went to Loretta's well her name is Loretta and that's how that she's the owner and I said you know I said do you just like being around us I said you're an owner and you're here at 9:00 at night usually you don't see owners there at 9:00 at night she said I just love to be around y'all she said I just love to be around y so that ought to show something that ought to tell you something even though we do act silly and laugh like crazy we do present maybe the Lord to to the world that they really don't get to see cuz a lot of it's fake ours is not but a lot of the world is f they they hate to see fake no they don't sure sure sure well hey they see something different even though like I said if you were to walk in cuz they were say we played the Left Right game out in the parking lot it's just so happened where we were there wasn't a lot of cars so we played the Left Right game and sister Kathy you were alive and well there and you weren't even there you'd start doing the Left Right game and you'd look around and somebody'd be holding four bags you're supposed to only have one and no and three people be going I don't have one so sister Kathy you were there in spirit and in truth so but good to be in the house of the Lord but yeah people around us probably thought we were crazy but you know what Paul said in the way it's called heresy I worship the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ so let's turn to John 14 and we're going to try to uh you know Jesus he he comes up to a place and I believe this is the whole point of him being on Earth was to show the father amen cuz they didn't understand who the father was so he was here to show who the father is and how he worked on Earth and sometimes it may be a little different we're going to read some things like I said this morning in Sunday school we're going to read some things that seems of opposite but I'm going to let Jesus talk to you okay if you don't believe me believe Jesus he's the one that said it okay all right so let's bow our heads before we before we get started dear Lord we thank you today for this time that we've come Lord that we set aside every week Lord to speak about you father and we pray that you would be the active participant be the speaker Lord be the hearer be the Seer be Lord be the one that that does all the work in this congregation today father that you'll be with the ones that are sick Lord the ones that are sin sick ones that need a touch from you father we pray that you would come now to and minister to each one Lord just be with the ones that are not here that are sick ones that are traveling just bless them and take care of them we thank you Lord for the time we had last night and the fellowship and friendship that we have together we pray Lord that we'll be together now one with you as we sat down and hear what you had to say while you were here on Earth father forgive us of our sins be with us be with the foreign missionaries on the field bless them Lord and take care of them in Jesus name amen St John 141 let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house or many mansions if I if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also and whether I go you know and the way you know so he's not going to leave us where we don't know anything Thomas said unto him Lord we know not whether thou goest and how can we know the way Jesus said unto him I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me so to get to the father we know we have to go by the son of man if you had known me you should have known my father also and from henceforth you know him and have seen him now philli says wait a minute Lord we just see you in other words Lord show us the father and it will satisfy us in other words they had a question among theel it will satisfy Jesus said un him have I been so long time have I been this 50 years with you since the prophet left all right and yet hast thou not known me Phillip he that hath seen me hath seen the father and how sayest thou then showest the father believest thou not that I am in the father and the father in me he's asking a question there's a question mark you see it right the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the work believe me that I am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very Works sake you may be seated and the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word so we see he says believe me even just believe me for the work's sake but now we're also going to watch in the life of Jesus that we're going to see some of them looked at his works and called him B up some of them looked at his works and called him everything but God right amen amen so I want you to I want us to go now to John 149 John 1419 he says yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live you shall live also at that day which a prophet of God we know it's this day and I believe if Martin Luther was reading it he'd say at this day cuz that was his day when he was here right at that day you shall know that I am in the father and ye in me and I in you now that's a sermon in itself but what we're going to do is we're going to stay with the New Testament stay with what Jesus said he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he is he that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him so the only people that God's going to really manifest himself to is the people that know him now as as we see before in Scripture that Jesus said one time he said depart from me I never knew you in other words I never had a personal relationship that's the same thing you must know who he is right know where he's at you sure he's inside of me okay all right that's fine but remember when you look back in the Old Testament because we must set this scene everyone that Jesus was around when when he was here lived by the Old Testament you were either a Publican a sinner or you were what a Pharisee sadducee herodian somebody that knew that Old Testament up one side and down the other in other words they had read all their life the Old Testament so they should have known what was the problem with the people why didn't they know who Jesus was cuz he came exactly there's no way he could be the word made flesh and break the word amen there's no way he could be the word made flesh and break the word he had to be the word made manifest um Hebrews 10:5 a body thou Hast prepared me what from the Old Testament certain on saw him in a certain way certain ones saw him in another way but they all saw him the exact way he came but now wait a minute the religious world and most of the people that were around him did not understand who he was called him everything but what he was now I'm telling you this because that's what's going to happen to me and you you and I are if the son of man Ministry is here and I'm saying that if a question to you not to me but if you believe the son of man Ministries here like I said you got the same Devils to deal with you've got the same spirit of God to deal with amen so we got to look at this and see I was telling them this morning and I don't want to I don't want to sound really sacriligious but I'm going to tell you something if if Jesus walked on this Earth I said if that's for you not me and inside of that man was the Holy Ghost he was the Holy Ghost amen he just said he said the world will see me no more but you will see me because I'll be with you even what in you so look those same eyes you say you're getting too close I'm not close enough yet the same eyes that walk the shores of Galilee should be able when we look in the commentary of the word should be able to open up that vision of what happened and know that it was a reality cuz you were there you were there that's why only by the Holy Ghost can you get true revelation because the Holy Ghost was already there he already done the work now he's in you but what the problem is with us is he's got to work back out through the filter right of the carnal mind right he's got to work back out to the and the only way you can work out through that is this because I wasn't there physically when this happened but if the same spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead same we don't believe he's a third person we don't believe the Holy Ghost is a second person father son Holy Ghost third person right we believe he's the person well if that the person came to you at the new birth then then then he should be able to look back out look into the history that man man wrote this no doubt on paper but God put it together there's no way Mark could tell you or Luke could tell you cuz they weren't there now Matthew you could say Okay Matthew was there and he could write it down John was there and he could write it down but now definitely Mark and Luke was not there when Jesus was there so it had to come just like we've always said about Moses Moses wasn't in the Garden of Eden but I believe God just opened up a vision right of what happened and it was the truth see we sometimes we see Visions maybe in in our man sees a vision and it won't always come to pass but now if God shows you a vision that's why when we I was thinking about that when we were watching or listening to to brother brandham he's got his back turned to the congregation he says I see a man now he's lying if he didn't see him right he's looking right here that man is right back there right but he's looking at the man right here what God has opened up a dimension or opened up a television and he's seeing that man s because remember he said stand up and he said there you are he sees a man stand up you say oh that's for a prophet well okay it's for a prophet but we're supposed to be Kings and Priests we're supposed to be little Messiahs little eaglets little prophets right amen because look when when you come to that eagle anointing that was not just for William brandham he broke that open so that we can see listen you can't get a revelation without somebody already going there and bringing it to you and then when you see it amen God opens a vision for you either that or you have secondhand information amen and you know what secondhand information will do I can tell brother Mark something and by the time it gets to brother colle it ain't nothing I said I mean we've tried that before we played games like that why it's because my interpret his interpretation of what I said not exactly what I said now I said exactly what I meant but he interpreted it to brother dick some other way and then all the way back through here and by the time it gets to brother Kylie he's he just don't have a clue what I said but see that's not God When God says it he wrote it in a book he gave us the Holy Ghost he took the author and didn't send the author away he brought the author right back down here amen that's why on the day of Pentecost that that 120 in the upper room had been tutored what they took that word that that man Jesus had said held it in their heart and I'm going to read it to you in just a few minutes they didn't understand it right they did not understand it cuz you I'm going to read him in just a few minutes the Bible says and they understood him not right right right but now in the day of Pentecost when Peter comes out Peter says this is that right and now he you know you say well that's in Joel I believe Peter was inside of him he was boiling up he said this is that that this man for three and a half years has told us this is what come and now here we go all right and that's the same way we should be we should be when we get the Holy Ghost that that's why there's not much Holy Ghost around there's not much understanding sure you can get you can get knowledge the Pharisees had knowledge they had Moses's quotebook they said we have Moses that's not too bad if you got Moses if you got the god of Moses but if you just got Moses's Ten Commandments they're going to kill you well we have Abraham right Ain that what they said Jesus looked at them and said you don't have the same Father Abraham had and you don't have the same father Moses had and you definitely ain't got the same father I have right he said you have a different what he said you have they say he said you can read to me what you see but you are not understanding seeing they see but don't understand that's the same way with us being here 50 years in the message we've read and read and read and read and that's okay but we must understand right I was telling them downstairs and I I want I want us to really see this brother Brown preached to seals 50 some OD years ago right and we have it in book form we can read it and that's the word of God to me that is that is the word of God hold on a minute that's not the word of God but it's the word of God brought the most plain of anyone has ever brought on the face of the earth except Jesus himself he put it in that book and it's plain now why haven't we took a rapture we read it most of you could quote half of the seal why are we still here we not getting what's on the paper right we're not getting it the reason being it's not written on that paper right now I don't want you to misunder understand me ever that we're looking for another word to come no another Prophet to come no no we got everything we need right what we're doing is though is we're doing just like Paul you know what Paul did when Paul said the letter kth you know what he's looking at he was looking at those Old Testament Scrolls the letter kth but the spirit giveth life same thing with the message of the hour the letter will kill you but the spirit behind the letter right is what will give us life amen the unwritten part brother told us many times the love letter will you tell me the seals are open I believe amen why are we still here I thought that was the greatest message ever preached and I was going to change our body why are we still here we're not getting what said right we're not getting we're not getting the full Revelation I was telling them this morning it's that onion peel you know you take you just keep peeling layers of the onion back we're getting part but we're not getting all of it we're not getting every bit of it so now watch let's look in in um let's go to Luke two CU we want to we want to see how this develops and then bring it up now this is when Jesus was 12 or 13 years old all right it came to pass that after after three days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the doctors both hearing them and asking them questions and all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers and when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said unto him son why hast thou dealt with us Behold thy father I've sought The Sorrowing brother brandham said you know what she done she let down to Bar there she was she lost her testimony he say oh that's bad John lost his John the Baptist lost his testimony right it's not bad to lose it but you got to find it again right and he said unto them how is it that you sought me you see that question how is it that you sought me are you coming looking for me as your son are you coming to look at me as my Father's son what'd he say because he answered he's he's asking wished you not that I must be about my father's business and they understood not the saying now wait a minute this woman knows that she didn't know old man and had this baby that's now 13 years old she knows that yet they understood not the saying which he spake unto them right because what would have happened is he should have went back and like brother Ram said and started building cabinets and doors and windows that would have been his Earthly father's business but he said I must be about my father's business now what do we see though at after this 12y old statement he was 12 we don't hear anything from him till he comes back to the River Jordan right all right now is he just sitting under a tree for those years no I think he's developing he is he is um let me put it this way he's learning to live in a human body come on God had never lived in that human body before right so he was learning to live in that human body and then he had to fulfill scripture just like we said he had to be becoming 30 because the priest could only handle certain things until he become 30 and then he could go in to the temple and Jesus could not break scripture all right now what was the father's business that's my question today my show us the father okay what's the father's business what is the father's business somebody want to take a stab at it the father's business was to be the son of man right think about it if he never was the son of man you and I never would understand him and the father's business is Jesus said about so many years after that he said repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand right amen so the father's business is is to come as the son of man so that we can understand him right cuz God doesn't want us not to understand him right he's give us all these Avenues cuz the first Doctrine the prophet of God said Matthew 4:17 we're not going to we're not going to read any quotes today but we're going to read scripture Matthew 4:1 17 says from that time Jesus began to preach to say repent for the kingdom of Heaven is at hand right amen so he brought he is bringing through the son of man what the father wants him to say because he said I do what he said I do nothing I do nothing but what the father reveals to me first all right in other words when he would um go to um raise somebody from the dead the Lord I mean the father would already sh him that right the prophet of God told us he said God showed him four days ago that he was going to raise Lazarus right but then he comes to Lazarus and he says for your sake I'm going to pray there's a revelation in that that will not touch on this sermon but maybe another one he said he said I don't need to pray all you all he knew all he was going to raise him because what God already showed it to him what am I saying people listen we've got to be able to see this Revelation in a vision right but that Vision must be a reality amen amen hey Jesus was crucified before the foundation of the world right why do you have to come here and do that right your name was put on L's Book of Life for the foundation of the world why do you have to come here and be a sinner you had to come into this world into this Earth this domain to prove to Satan who God is that's just my whole thing that I see that God is so just he can't just say a there see most of us if we had that much power sister Anna we'd have this big head so I'm God I'm God I do what I want to yeah and he can but he is so much just till I believe he had to look at the Devil and say look I'm going to prove to you who I am but I'm not going to prove to you who who I am the way you think I'm going to prove to you who I am I'm going to do it in a bunch of people I'm going to do it in some people that you made fall in sin I'm going to bring out that that you think you've beat me with and I'm going to turn around and defeat you with the very thing that you think you've defeated me with cuz when he went what he went where he went to the Garden of Eden to stop me and you from coming on this earth right amen Satan came to stop All Sons and Daughters of God from coming to this earth and he did temporarily but God said I'll put enmity just hang on I'm going to put a division but in other words I'm going to bring that division back together how am I going to do it by the father's business right I'm going to come as the son of man and I'm going to bridge that Gap together so that we can sit here today in 2017 and understand a God that lived in flesh 2,000 years ago right you say we can't yes we the people of this hour will understand God in flesh more than anybody right that ever lived on the face of the Earth outside of Jesus Christ himself and we fall asleep makes us nothing but it makes us everything no one no one will understand this God in human flesh but us the way he absolutely wanted it because it's going to so bring everything together till it's going to change our body no one else like brother Dale's been preaching on the on the 77s and the 50 I hope you catch that I hope you catch that that we have to come into that Jubilee we have to make everything go free cuz there's no where else there's not another Jubilee to come amen and I I think about something other day and I just want to add a little bit to what he's saying about 2026 we we're going to pass 2026 we're not this world is do you know if if if everything blew up in 2026 that it's still going to be 30 26 Before Time ends right are we going to live a thousand years of Millennium and it's going to be still in time so we can go to 3026 in calendar time and and not break any Scripture right so you see you you look and you say well this has got to abruptly end no remember the Millennium is still seventh day we're actually in the 6,000 year the 7,000 year is the Millennium why listen I was thinking this last night Jesus I had a hard time last night did anybody have a hard time last night sleeping I had a hard time um Monica said she did I had a hard time sleeping for some reason but anyway Jesus Jesus if if we're the type if he's the type he rested remember on the seventh day the Creator God Worked six days and rested seven right Jesus Worked six days what day was he in the grave what day was he in the grave the seventh day he rested that seventh day and then he came into an eight Hey listen people when he come out of that grave on Monday on Sunday morning that's the new beginning he's wanting that's the one that's the a that's the eternity that were that was the future home walking on the Earth all power in heaven Earth has been given unto me I don't have to eat if I don't want to but I want to I don't have to walk through that wall but I can I've been so Bound for 33 years he said I'm free that was the eighth day he rested the seventh resurrected on the eighth and he was in an eternal body still down here in time you say he that can't happen that's what's going to happen to us cuz remember this world's going to live another Thousand Years in time and we're going to be Eternal we're going to be changed down here I I I I don't want to I don't want to scare you or surprise you but we're going to be changed on this side right here I didn't know if you knew that or not but kind of makes me happy me and Bob was I mean this makes me happy that I'm going to be changed over here I'm not going to have to wait and go somewhere and be changed I'm going to be changed right here even if I go by the grave I'm still going to be changed right here in this Dimension I'm getting off my sermon all right go back let's look at this man we call the son of man let's go to Matthew oh you already got nine now watch here we look at this This Man Called Jesus and we put him in a situation to where he comes up and says behold they brought to him a man sick of the paly lying on a bed and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the paly son of good cheer thy sins be forgiven now that really stumped them there and behold certain of the scribes said within themsel this man blasphemeth and Jesus knowing their thoughts said wherefore think ye evil in your hearts for whether is easier to say thy sins be forgiven thee or to say rise up and walk but that ye may know right with no question that you may know that the son of man hath power on Earth to forgive sins then saith he sick of the poliy arise take out thy bed and go up to thy house that really stomped him there in 96 because they said why do you how can you do that but he told them plainly the son of man hath power on Earth to forgive sins you know I always wondered the other day you know and we'll read this maybe next Sunday where Jesus said that that if you say anything against the son of man it'll be forgiven you I thought man that's God in human flesh why you say he said you can say something against me in other words but you say something against the Holy Ghost right that stumped me till the other day but not you look at the people that talked about Jesus that even his own mother doubted who he was at one time we just read that even though she knew who what she had done she still doubted right well God didn't hold that against her amen right the son of man was a human mortal man on Earth somebody could say something listen how many times did Jesus heal somebody and tell them say don't you say a word and never did they not say a word so what did they do now if it would be me and you say well that's lying against God no that's the son of man telling him say look don't tell nobody because I don't want all this Fame and Fortune but what was inside of him was saying Go Tell it had to be the Son of God go tell go tell them but the son of man was saying no don't tell anybody now how many times you reading the Bible if you're reading Matthew Martin Luke and John this is about my fourth time through Matthew Mark Luke and John go through Matthew Mark Luke and John and and look and see how many times he tells somebody don't say a word and one of them is is one in one scripture this guy is like screaming he's like running through the temple Temple I'm Healed I'm Healed Jesus said don't say I'm Healed I'm Healed no God was wanting his word out through people if you stay one son of man he resurrect it goes up into heaven and we're we're done that's why he had to come back in the end time folks that's why he has to come back in the end time right to do it through me and you the Son of God the Son of God can save your soul all day long but to get the real understanding of who God was is that man that was walking in human flesh that would tell his disciples the world will see me no more but you'll see me and then Phillip he keeps talking about this father and and philli says well well you keep talking about this man show him to us and and and we'll believe you in other words or or it will say satisfies he said Phillip have I not taught you the message for 50 years did I not bring you the message and now it's 50 years after the messenger's gone and we still are here Philip have I been so long with you congregation has God been so long with us right if I'm like brother brandham if I was God I'd say it one time and that'd be it remember he said that he said if I was God I'd say it one time and if you didn't believe it that's it but see that wouldn't be Grace right that wouldn't be grace for us that would not be Grace but we do have Grace now let's go to the next one now continue on down Matthew 9:10 Watch What Happens and it came to pass as Jesus said at meet in the house behold many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples and when the Pharisees saw it they said to the disciples why eateth your master with publicans and sinners but when Jesus heard that he said unto them they that be whole need not a physician right but they that are sick but go ye and learn what that meanthe will have mercy and not sacrifice for I am not come to call the righteous but Sinners to repentance he didn't come to tell us he came to show us he showed us the father he didn't just tell us about the father he he showed us the father then came him to the Disciples of John saying why why do we and the phes fast often but thy disciples fast not Jesus said unto them can the children of the Bride chamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them right but the day will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them and then shall they fast in other words what do you tell them it's not going to do any good for them to fast now I'm here with them I'm here with them but when I leave it will be good for us to fast every once in a while to get everything out of the way so that God can speak to us so watch he's bringing it he's bringing it out now go to mark 2 I know we're skipping around a little bit but I like to skip around some now watch here we are here's another scene that the religious people of the world and it came to pass he went through the corn field on the Sabbath day and his disciples began as they went to pluck the ears of corn now does everybody understand what that is yeah it happened during Boaz and ru's time there was a tradition that when you gleaned your field you left the corners you would glean in a circle and if you had a square field you left the corners for the wayfar and stranger or the one that was poor because remember what Boaz say he said leave some handful of purpose leave some around the edges so that the poor people right can pick up food well that's what they were doing they were walking through the corn field eating corn and as the Pharisees said unto him behold why do they on the Sabbath day that which is not lawful now that's not even the law that very verbatim thing that they weren't cooking corn they weren't taking corn back to their house and cooking it and preparing it now that is against the Sabbath because you're not supposed to cook it's what it says in the Old Testament but they weren't doing that they were eating the corn as they were passing through all right but the Pharisees misinterpreted we're going to read here in just a minute this is one of the Traditions that they their interpretation of the word that that Jesus said you have made your traditions in other words the word of God and you've took the word of God and made it of none effect right all right and he said unto them have you never read what David did now he takes him right back to the scripture when he had need and was a hunger and they that ate that were with him how they went into the house of God the days of abath the high priest and did eat the shoe bread now listen he they didn't go in the holy of holies right amen all right they didn't go in the holy of holies God would have killed them but there is shoe bread in that second Court where the manora is in the second Court there's a shoe bread bowl for the priest to eat they went in there and eat the shoe bread which is not lawful to eat but for the priest and gave also to them which were with him and he said unto them the Sabbath was made for man not man for the Sabbath right therefore the son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath what he done he gave them a revelation of what he had said in that Old Testament and they denied it they called him Belo you think about that you think about that nowadays we we were talking about this downstairs all these doctrines and all these things that that and you take let's just take Daniel 70 weeks for example we brought the truth of Daniel 70 weeks I believe 99.9% of the preachers in this message said that we were false now what if we were true you're saying you're the listen we got to be the son of man yes not two people not one person a group but you know what if you believe what we believe and it's right then you're the son of man made manifest hello amen therefore the son of man is Lord of the Sabbath what did he do he put that condition on top of that that the son of man is not here to do away with the law right right but to show you what the law is actually said same way with the doctrines that's why we're still here people is because we don't have I say we I say everybody let's just let's just lump us all together we don't have the 100% true Revelation that son of man had 100% Revelation he wasn't just he didn't just have the Revelation he was the Revelation amen so we got to understand that's why I say whatever he is and whatever he went through and whatever he said has got to happen here Glory it's got to happen here amen there's no way it could we can't bypass it it's got to happen right and you know what if he's here that's my question to you if he's here he's got to do the same thing amen he can't do anything different that's right than what he came to do the first time amen he's forgiven sins he's the lord of the Sabbath in other words he's brought a revelation that they had never seen before right and they turned it down called him bbub told him he was a false prophet right so will they do today Matthew 15 ver1 then came Jesus to to the scribes and Pharisees which were of Jerusalem saying why do thy disciples transgress the tradition now look the tradition of the elders it didn't say the word of God said why do you transgress the tradition of the elders they held that tradition of the elders higher than they the pure word of God right hello I don't want you to I hope you see one thing I'm not talking about when this was written 20 when this was I'm talking about now right that same devil the same God is here now amen doing the same thing amen doing the same thing why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders in other words why do you preach that there's seven years left after the Rapture CU that's exactly what the Bible says I said that's what the Bible says right that's the word of God Amen for they wash not their hands when they eat bread I don't either a lot but he answered and said unto them look why he said why do you transgress the Commandment of God by your tradition for God commanded saying what honor thy father and thy mother now what's he doing he's bringing a situation that they come under he took he he's already told him I'm not even worried about this in other words this is foolishness right okay this is foolishness because transgressing the Commandment of God now here's the Commandment of God for God commanded saying honor thy father and thy mother and he that curses father and mother let him die the death but your Revelation but your Revelation says who shall ever shall say to his father or his mother it is a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me and honor not his father mother other what he done they bringing gift to the priest not even worried about what they're doing to their father and mother they're bringing gifts to the priest priest said oh you're okay now is that not the Roman Catholic s is that not the Roman novenia is that that that not we don't care what the Bible says but if you'll pay us a little money you don't have to honor your father or mother Jesus said uh-uh thus have you made the Commandment of God of no una affect by your tradition amen same way with you and I if it's a tradition right all right for God commanded we already said that all right we got that one all right let's go to Mark 3 verse one he entered into the synagogue and there was a man there which had a withered hand and they watched him whether he would heal him on the Sabbath day that they might accuse him I want you watch these spirits and I want you to be aware of them I think the Lord's trying to tell you you need to be aware of them now we need to be aware of them now it's just a good story to read if it's back then but if the son of man is here that same devil just came right on with him and they watched him whether he would heal on the Sabbath that they might accuse him and he said unto the man which had the withered hand stand forth and he said unto them is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath day or to do evil he asked him a question to save life or to kill but they held their peace and when he looked around about on them with anger being grieved for the hardness of their heart he saith unto the man stretch forth thine hand and he stretched it down and his hand was restored as whole as the other watch look at the question is it lawful to do good on a Sabbath day or to do evil or to save life or to kill but they held their peace they knew they better not answer that because because in the Old Testament several things look Sabbath day is on Saturday for them the seventh day right right but if you had a child and if he had to be circumcised he was circumcised on the eighth day after his birth if that fell on the Sabbath day guess what they did they circumcised him so they're going we're not doing nothing on the Sabbath but Jesus is turning around going wait a minute I know better than that and even the Bible says if you if your Ox gets in the ditch you going to pull it out if one of your sheep gets lost in the woods are you going to just leave him there no you're going to go find him but what he now look the tradition or the Commandment that they took was is to do nothing that's why they were called Hypocrites by Jesus cuz he knew they were doing the very thing they were condemning him of doing same today same today the religious people are the ones that's going to watch you because the sinner don't care think about that for a minute let that sink in for a second all right let's go to Luke 7 verse 31 the Lord said where unto then shall I liken the men of this generation and what are they like all right he's fixing to tell you they are likened to children sitting in the marketplace and calling one to another and saying we have piped unto you and you have not danced we have mourned to you and you have not went for John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine and you say he at the Devil the son of man has come eating and drinking and you say Behold a gluttonous man and a wine bibber right A friend of publicans and sinners but wisdom is Justified of all her children what's he saying here they are like children sitting in the marketplace calling to one another saying we have piped unto you and you have not danced right we have mourned to you and you have not wept for John the Baptist came neither eating bread or drinking wine you say he had a devil in other words what is he saying is you're saying he's got a devil now what are you talking about me cuz I'm I'm he must have ate and he must have liked wine this is him talking about himself you see what I'm saying when when we look at people and and we say well he he he can't be growing in Grace and knowledge cuz he still Cuts up what's that got to do with it that's that's being a person right but it's the word of God being made manifest right the son of man is has come eating and drinking but wisdom is Justified of all her children in other words what he saying you lack wisdom of anything you're supposed to be the most wise that's what Jesus I believe he got angry about let me paraphrase this Jesus is talking to the religious world he said look I came and gave you everything you needed I came I gave you prophets I gave you teachers I gave you men of God that read the word every day in your temple I am the one that come down the bread out of heaven and I'm the one that fed you when you needed feeding I am the one that came and gave you everything you needed for your journey and now I'm hearing human flesh and you're turning me down I come exactly the way that I told you I was coming I come exactly the way that I said 2,000 years ago I was going to hit this Earth and you are turning me down so is it today Mark 6 just a few more because next Sunday what we'll do is we'll get into more of John because John brings more of the father to me it shows more of the you know the Son and the father talking cuz remember he he prays the prayer and in John 17 but this is just to show you look watch everybody stand up stand up Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a WR like me and will keep me awake I once was lost but now I'm found do this was blind but now I see now sit back down I said I was going to do that and I did didn't I do that you know R boo devil you think God's going to put you to sleep okay then you know who's working today Bob you know who's working today he's on the job and listen I like this one he went from and came to his own country and I see this in brother branham's life too watch brother brandham he C to his own people and they just he was just old brother Bale greatest Prophet ever hit the face of the Earth and his disciples followed him and when the Sabbath day was come he began to teach in the synagogue many hearing him were astounded astonished saying from whence has this man these things and what wisdom is this now remember watch this he was in his own country right what wisdom is this which is given unto him that even such Mighty works are wrought by his hand is not this the carpenter the son of Mary the brother of James and Joseph and of Judah and of Simon and are not his sisters here with us and they were offended at him his own family but Jesus said unto them a prophet is not without honor but in his own country and among his own kin the Bible is Southern hey we ain't done yet and he couldn't there do no Mighty work say that he laid his hands upon some sick folk you don't say that in New York or Boston do you brother Mark I didn't think so folkus down here Southern language and his hand was laid upon a few sick folk and healed them so he had Ken folk and sick folk so he's good he's in the southern he's in his own house but they did not understand him same way with you and I the world's not going to understand us I hope they don't listen The World Is Not Meant to understand you the world is not meant to like Brother D said we have to live in leosa but we're not of Lea there's things that like we were talking about when we went to the U to the thing at Myrtle Beach this man couldn't wrap his brain around that we didn't mix baath and we didn't wear bathing suits and we didn't we didn't mix and me mingle with the world like that and drink and do he it's like who are you people well we're not of this world I started to tell him I said look we're not of here but you know what they're going to do they're going to Brand you just like they branded him right a heretic somebody don't somebody that's weird but he couldn't even do any Mighty Works he had to leave there's another scripture that says he had to leave remember what he did with one of them he had to take them outside right there was so many people inside that was unbelievers now you say that's God Almighty in human flesh it happens here it happens in your job it happens everywhere sometimes you have to pull somebody away and get alone with them to get to talk to to about God or talk to God with them because of what the unbelief this morning you see how hard unbelief is the son of man had to had to take somebody outside just so he could heal them because there was so much unbelief in the building I pray that doesn't ever happen here that we have so much unbelief that somebody can't get healed cuz brother random said one person in a congregation with unconfessed sin or unbelief can stop a person from being healed if you see me pray I stand right there and I lift my hands when somebody's being prayed for I don't pray for the person that's brother Dale's job when he's up here or the preacher I say God don't let me stand in the way clear my heart of anything that I'm thinking right any clear my conscience clear my heart I don't want to be the one that you have to say one day brother Mark didn't get healed because you were standing there thinking a bad thought about him or a bad thought about clear your thought get get that out of the way you say oh that doesn't work listen brother brandham would make people close their eyes when they would he would drive out certain spirits but now certain Spirits he didn't say that epilepsy and certain ones he said you better close your eyes why cuz those Spirits when they leave they go somewhere right I think we need to live a little bit more or maybe think a little more in the Supernatural realm because we are Supernatural people me and brother Bob was talking in the back uh and I'm just going to make this statement if we're sitting in Heavenly places and we're already resurrected sitting in Heavenly places your Soul's in another dimension it's not of this world if you're born again wait hold on Mane if you're born again your soul is not of this world didn't come from this world where'd it come from Genesis 126 man amen that all right so if we got that inside of us why don't we let it out sometime Glory let it work you so I'm afraid it will I'm afraid of your experience I am if you're afraid to let it out all right let's go to this one because this one is the one we're going to end on and let you think about this don't put it up yet how many knows that Jesus Christ is a prince of peace amen raise your hand if you know if Jesus Christ Prince of Peace amen the Prince of Peace hold on a minute let me tell you what he said about himself come on bring the next one up Matthew 10:32 said whoever therefore shall confess me before men him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven whosoever shall deny me before men him will I deny for my Father which is in heaven think not that I came to send peace right on Earth wait a minute brother he's you just said he was a prince of peace I know he's a prince of peace you know he's a prince of peace but he didn't say that he said think not that I am come to send peace on Earth right I came not to send peace but a sword I telling you what he said now we know he's a prince of peace I'm not denying that you know that too but what's he saying right here think not that I am come to send peace on Earth listen from the very time that man hit Earth there been Wars just over that one man right right right hello mohamad's fighting this one Judaism this one that one this one fighting Christianity think not I come to send peace now look you know what he's saying he's your Prince of Peace he's my prince of peace I have a world of Peace inside of me because I have the Holy Ghost but now this world is going to be destroyed that's right by that man because he's a righteous judge he didn't come to bring peace on Earth then when he hit this Earth he brought a word that's right he brought a sword I was telling him this morning we're on the on the uh second seal it says he was given a great sword what he was given a great word but what is Satan's great word that's right amen 99.9% truth we think oh no he's got this gruesome no one word off the great sword Satan was given is 99.9 % the truth and he just adds his one word and that's his sword but I came not to send peace but a sword for I am come to set a man at variance against his father a daughter against her mother the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law a man's foes shall be they of his own household how many can verify that see there how many can verify that a man's F shall be they of his own household but now watch he that loveth father and mother more than me now he don't say not don't love you mother and father he said if you love them more than me you're not worthy of me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me and he that taketh not his cross and followeth after me is not worthy of me so he did not come to bring peace on this earth right he brought peace to this earth but he didn't bring peace to this Earth because this Earth he will be the Prince of Peace of the earth when we get to the Future home that's right amen king of kings and Lord of lords but not right now he's king of kings and Lord of lords Big K little K Big L little L amen so you watch and see why somebody says well he's a prince of peace tell them say look in Matthew Matthew 30 uh verse 34 says he's not but remember he also talks and we'll cover it next Sunday we'll stop right here we'll cover it next Sunday he says I came in other words the the kingdom he he preaches that the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand but he said the Kingdom of Heaven since John is having to be taken by force right so so sometime and and the way I look at that is is some sometimes brother Dale myself some other ministers or deacons even have to handle a situation let's just say this is common everyday life we have to handle a situation sometimes that has to be a war because if you handle a situation look there's truth and there's error truth always trumps error truth is always truth error can be changed to truth amen so you have to take the the Waring Hey listen there's a variance right now going on in your head there's a variance or a war going on in your head right now of whether this is right or whether this is wrong or whether we really need to be here today or whether we need to be somewhere else right why because there's two forces right the devil and God there's two forces and Jesus was not immune to that when he came on the earth that's right cuz in Luke verse 10:21 we'll we'll read it and then we'll stop there and that's where we'll start next Sunday but in Luke 10:21 in that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven that thou H has hid these things from the wise and prudent and Hast revealed them unto babes even so father for it seemed good in thy sight in other words Jesus is walking through the world and he's saying father thank you that you've hid this in me cuz he he hadn't hid it in anybody else yet he said thank you Father that you've hid these things in me and that nobody's going to see me except my children nobody's going to see me except those that are born again of the same spirit that I'm walking around with all things are delivered to me of my father and no man look no man knoweth who the son is but the father and who the father is but with the son right and he to whom the son will reveal him amen you can't understand the Son of God without having a son of man on Earth the son of man had to come on Earth he had to do the father's business is to reveal himself in the Sun so that you and I can understand who he is so Philip says show us the father you know what if we would have been there take us back teleport us 2,000 years ago with the Holy Ghost we'd say Phillip if you've seen me you've seen the father whatever I do the works that I do though in other words I would tell Philip The Works that I do in a few short days you're going to do the same thing you're going to understand when we go to you go to Pentecost you're going to understand that is I'm saying if we could teleport oursel back past where we were standing there with Jesus because listen let me tell you something P we close even if you could do that if if you could take yourself with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the word that we know now I believe Brother D you could take yourself right back there and put yourself in Jesus's shoes that's right and be the same thing yes sir that's a revelation folks you could I believe I could take anybody Born Again of the word of God baptized with the Holy Ghost in This Church age and take them right cuz listen if the son of man Ministry has come here where did it come from I come from God I go back to God sir Jesus said I am my father one you could stand there and I believe you could understand exactly what was going on so listen let me give you this point I think that we are not trinitarians but probably more tunist than we are anything else cuz we haven't really realized that that same spirit that is here for I tell you well hold on and he turned him to his disciples and he said privately blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see for I tell you that many prophets and Kings have desire desired to see those things which you see glory and have not seen them and to hear those things which you hear and have not heard them every Prophet amen every Prophet if they were sitting here today they wouldn't be half asleep like most of you are y'all must had a long night last night you better listen to this message again CU you only got a few sentences at a time but hey we all get sleepy but this should this should that's why I say about Tunis you what we're saying is is well that's Jesus and well well that's Jesus and well that same one thank you that's why I say we mostly are tunist we mostly I know it is that's why that's why we keep trying to preach this that's why we get up every Sunday and trying to get you to see that we're one inal fortitude yes it does it takes a lot of intestinal fortitude and some of us have a lot of intestine I don't know about the fortitude part but listen I do I think that we separate this thing too much that's right right let's be honest and all Shake our head and say yes well that was Jesus that was what he did that was back then that was then now let's come back up to 19 in the 50s and 60s well that was in brother brandham well that was in William brandham well did he take it with him did Jesus take it with him where'd he put it one more time where'd he put it so we are mostly Tunis be honest I just can't see understand that I am the same person that was standing saying this right here but I'm telling you that's the only way we're going to get out of here amen is to be that person am he said I only do that let's stand he said I only do that which the father shows me that's I only do so in other words he didn't go off on a false Doctrine so you know one thing for sure if somebody goes off on a false Doctrine he's not of his father he might be of his father but he's not of that father amen thank you well Jesus says thank you Father that you've hid these things from the eyes of the wise and prudent and revealed them to this seventh Church age yeah right this message of the hour the greatest message ever hit to face of the Earth you and I are the greatest people that ever hit to face of the Earth you say I jesus never had a day that he got up and said I might be God did he he never got up and said well I really don't know what I'm doing here now listen we as human moral men and women we do that but who's talking put that in the Bible it ain't there we really do and I I've always wanted to say that and I'm glad you agreed at least you did we're mostly tunist and we don't have enough Revelation to know that that same spirit that was in that man is in me looking through these same eyes looking at this same word and reflecting back off of that and we're able and I don't want to be sacrilegious again but I'm telling you I'm beginning to see things I'm beginning to see things I was talking to Bob about the dimensions and all but we should be able brother brandham told us one time he said if you if I could take the spirit of John Dillinger and put it inside of brother dick now what his mindset will be is is tomorrow at 9:15 he going to go case out of bank he's going to get his gun right right I'm going to get my getaway car and I'm going to go find out how to get away ain't that what John Dillinger did that was the spirit of John Dillinger in brother dick I'm going to my whole mindset is is I'm going to rob that bank at 9:45 because that's when the teller you see what I'm saying but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you you what should you get up in the morning and do what should you get up in the morning and do yeah eat cereal drink coffee that's the human part of your body but what should you do you should walk forth showing Jesus Christ you should walk forth knowing that one day you might meet somebody that you need to talk to or somebody meets you and sees sees that you're a little bit different than somebody else and they ask that hey where do you go to church or or what what's you know what especially you sisters they go where you from I see you your Holiness or or you may be this or that well hey that's Jesus Christ that's as much Jesus Christ as me standing behind the pull pit cuz if I can't get nothing to you by that way maybe the sisters can get to the World by that way by their dress and their mannerism and not going out and and you know I hope to God that we don't are seen in bars and and shooting pool and on Sunday and all these other things but that that's for what that's another spirit that enters into a man to make them go do that our spirit that enters into US is we need to worship GL we need to come to church prayed up we need to come to church not just that day and that morning think about God because we got to come to the Tabernacle right because remember Jesus said your Traditions your traditions you pray loud you give you know this is way they were giving their tithe you know I got $8,000 tith check right here but the widows mate nobody ever knew except Jesus right he put that in there and he said she gave all it wasn't the amount of money it was the heart that gave it same thing with you and I not monetary but I'm talking about we have inside of us we better start exercising this thing that we got inside of us called the Holy Ghost cuz if we don't start exercising it guess what if you exercise profiteth little but it's not going to change you Jesus said it's not going to change your stature not going to change your stature if you just sit around and not read study and I want to say one thing good to see a church full of people good to see a church full of people a church full of people good to see a church full of people we got people that's coming that hadn't come doesn't come regular that come

saying look God this is all God this is all got that world has nothing for me it's like brother Dale said if you're scared that if I want to tell you right now that tomorrow morning the Raptor is going to take place if you went into an absolute fit you're not born again if you if you if it kept you up all night you know what I'd do if brother Dale come up here and said look God's revealed to me that six between 6:00 and 9: in the morning we're going into Rapture I'd go home I number one I'd make sure you know make sure everything's okay make sure the rabbits got a little food while we was gone June wasn't be there to s to him but no I would go to bed tonight brother dick and I think I'd have a a good night's sleep right I just believe I would cuz what am I going to worry about if the Raptor's coming tomorrow what am I what am I going to do step cuz what we do is is we stay up half the night worrying about something that we don't have no control over Jesus said take no thought for tomorrow but what do we do Gary sitting over there now going man I got to build that Porch tomorrow you will when we leave not until he gets home he said Not until I get home but if we knew the Rapture well listen let's live our life that way let's live our didn't brother Brown say live your life as though Jesus was coming right then well if you do then you'll go home and you'll lay your head on the pillow and you say father wake me up in the morning and if I have to go to work I go to work if I go in the Rapture so what no problem you love the Lord do what absolutely you ain't kidding 57 it's a jubilee isn't [Laughter] it well brother dick I hope I don't get 80 I just don't and I know you do but I hope you do well for 80 though you do great he does fine for 80 years old don't worry about that I got something on my mind sure go ahead help happen morning and not inv brother invol 9 the people that come behind that Pulpit right there and they say it's nice to be in the house of God right this morning hey my house of God's going to bed tonight right right that's right it's going to get up in the morning that's right and if it don't get up in the morning y'all carry on that's right yeah you only to be asleep for a night cuz you going you going to get up in the morning so Aaron CAU that back there it makes people mad a lot of times when you say I don't make me mad death had listen lives in that's right in that that's right that's right that's right that's right if you're not born again I mean don't go to bed repent yourself absolutely that's right that's right and that's the way it should be and I was telling them this morning just just to finish up here I you know we're in the study of the seals contact but fell out we were stud we're studying on the seals and I think sometimes we we're we're right on the edge of our seat waiting for for not me but waiting for God to show we're right on the edge of our seat Well maybe he'll say something so mysterious that we never saw before that ain't it I know we all are just like you said about tunist we most of us are most of us are waiting for Brother Dale to come out with that one sermon that we go someday that'll happen but you can't just sit here brain dead until that happens I'm sorry but but you know you you start in and brother Brown said this he told the people they weren't getting it in the seal right he said you're not getting it on the questions and answers on the seals after the six seal he said you're not getting it it's not for you well I contend it's for us right he was preaching that sermon 50 years almost down the road to you and me so now what is it is it this new book that we're going to find is it this new tape we're going to hear forget that the Bible said that the perfecting of the Saints would come by somebody breaking the word down for you Apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists a five-fold Ministry to get us all ready some of you may like like like the way I preach some of you may some of you may like brother Dale and some of you may not that's what the fivefold ministry is for he gave some he didn't give all he gave some Apostles some prophets some pastors teachers but you got to have all five we got to have all five we can't be so narrow-minded because look I'm telling you one more time if brother brandham was the only one to come to bring take us in a Rapture and just ex what he said on that tape verbatim with his voice then somebody's missed it we've been here 50 years that we've missed it no it's that we have got to get ready through a

whatever you say he didn't say what the preacher said to the mountain didn't say what the prophet said to the mountain it says what you say the mountain so you say it whatever Mountain you got in your heart got to move it if you say it and believe it know who you are know what you're doing here know that you're not a second person of a Trinity right or a third or even the first you know we say that about Jesus you know we say brother Ram said that well that's same way with us when we get to Glory this is not going to be too people true Oneness is billions of Christians in one God right name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's all it is and then all this other Grace that's going to come around and I was telling them this morning I want to tell you too that that watch and see uh Terence and Lisa and I some of us were talking about different people that are passing away around you do he different ones some people's been good to me have passed away drop dead if they're going to be given eternal life why's God God's not going to let them go through the tribulation he done the best thing in the world for him he put them to sleep for a little while he hid them in his Pavilion Book of Psalms I love that cuz he says hiding me in your Pavilion what is a pavilion it's a covering it's a cover and you run under it and there's no rain or anything can get to you that's what he's doing there's several people in our life terence's life different one of us that you look and see and you wonder why this person die I'm not talking about born again I'm not talking about Richard he's born again believer I'm talking about people that God is that's God going to give eternal life for being good to you right I've seen that three or four times close people that have been just dear friends of mine good but not Christian and they just die well what the that's we should glory in that right you say why are these people dying around me maybe God's going to give him eternal life because of you sometimes we think different sometimes we think and we think why is all these people dying around me if God's going to give them eternal life for being good to you why would he let them go through the tribulation he's doing the best thing he can ever do for him he'll hide them until the Judgment right they'll come up and be given eternal life right I'm telling you we ain't touched the surface of God's love we have never even come close but listen if the same mind that's thinking of these things that thought of these things before the foundation of the world he's come and he's give them to me and you right remember we supposed to have the mind of Christ if the mind of Christ comes to you then you can see things in a different light instead of like oh wo it's me wow he W he woo why is this happening to me and turn it into a blessing three people in that real close to me that was good to me they all died and you think oh he had this one died this one died and then the Lord just one night he just popped me up one night and he said I'm doing the best thing I can do for him that's right Hallelujah I'm hiding them until the storm's over I'm hiding them Duty he's hiding him until the storm's over much is given much is required that's me and you they wasn't much given to duty and much is not requ ired I love what brother Brown we had a prophet to tell us that those that have that are a little slow they have a special angel and God takes care of them and and what they're never held accountable he was never held accountable for the things that he did you say oh that just that's God that's God to me that would be something that I would not do as a human but the grace of God but the grace of God you say no he went to pooh Hogs and I watched him drink and he said a couple of bad words you know what that was not that was not so that's the problem with me and you is our memory that we somebody did me wrong somebody you know what if somebody done you wrong but he became Born Again baptized with a holy ghost you know he did it but God don't know he did it that's why you better watch you better be careful if that guy or or girl is born again what about that prostitute that brother Bram what was her name um what was her name the one that was The Prostitute and the drunk Rosella now listen let's just be honest all those men she was with knew what she was everybody that was around her knew what she was but when she came before a prophet and gave her heart to God brother said now she's testifying what he not he's not holding any of that right now I'm going to stand up if I was the one that was one of her people I'm going to stand up and go hey and God's going to go she didn't do that I see it that's why he said woman where are your accusers righten if Jesus would have seen her commit adultery he'd have had to killed her he didn't see it and he got rid of her accusers and he said 'woman I don't know what you did it's just a rumor right I didn't hear it and that's what this is this is just a rumor the truth is what's inside of us let's bow our head dear heavenly father we pray Lord that you go with us today be with us as we walk in this journey of life but as we walk in this journey of life may we see why we're here Lord and the things that we're doing now sometimes may look strange may look weird may even look strange or weird to ourselves but may we see now by the teaching of the word that we the son of man Ministry if we see what you did and the reaction and the action back then we should be able to see the same thing here you were walking through life saying your sins are forgiven go and sin no more well Lord what about a person that's good to us somewhere their sins are going to be have to be wiped out if you're going to give them eternal life what a great father that we have what a great husband that this bride has that has covered us and kept us Lord I pray that you would continue to cover us and keep us but let us realize Lord that we're not two separate people and we're not we're not something that's walking separate from you but that the prophet of God told us he said God's hands are your hands God's feet are your feet God's eyes are your eyes so you've come down among men and and you've not just dwelt with us now you dwelling in us and I pray that you'd be with us take care of us the ones that come up for prayer Lord May all things be made well and if it be any sin Among Us Lord may you forgive us and may we be clean and clear and that we can look down at the word of God and see ourself in that word without there where Romans 81 says there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit Lord may we start becoming that word and not just being a quote or not just being something that that we that we see in the Bible that's a a quote of the day or scripture of the day but let it be that it's what we walk in it's what we do and the things that we say and and that we hear Lord each day of our life just be with us and bless us keep our pastor safe Lord keep him strong be with all the deacons and Elders song leaders the ones that are here now Lord that is doing jobs we pray that you'd be with them and the greatest job is the congregation that sits and listens and takes in the word of God and and listens and hears and then acts on it Lord we pray that you just take care of us bless us in Jesus name amen have a good week till we get back Wednesday Lord bless you Jesus said is for me to go but I'll send you another comfor to God you from day to day so they
