gonna see him in his people what are you doing get away you don't pray for sister Trudy Collins she'll be coming flying back tomorrow from Jamaica she went and had a little R&R with the baby so current said he's having some R&R too so I think he might be in joint he might be enjoying it more cheese anyway good to be in the house of Lord good happen every one of you Willis you got your Bibles turn to Revelation six or you can watch it on the screen but I want to cover this pretty quick I want to cover something at the end to maybe add a little bit to what brother Dale was talking about this morning so if that's all right because it all pertains to the seals and the Jews and it all pertains to us God nuts and the Jews well although it's a plan of redemption it's covered in all this so also by the way of announcement remember next Sunday we will have our we'll talk about officers and things like that just for the home folks and that will be I'll cut second service really short and then we'll just that way you won't have to stay over so much too ad service to a service so I also remember Bible studies next this coming Saturday and on marks the seventh which will be Thursday I'll be leaving for the Philippines toolmarks and 19th we've got our itinerary it is very tight so we got a lot to do in 14 days and two of those days with travel days so just keep us in your prayers also brother Jule there was a text sent out from I guess from sister Forney or the girl but he's gonna have to spend two days in the hospital everything's clearing up so thank God for that he told him he couldn't stay two days in the hospital without chickens so so he's fine he's okay but thank god we've the prayers of the saints I tell you you know you you get somebody like brother Julian aids not but one of him and man will you want to keep that guy you want God to protect that and but now remember on the flip side the Satan wants to get rid of it so we've got to keep him covered under that blood and and and remember his blood cuz this is blood pressure and his heart rate and things like that they're giving him some blood thinners to try to get his heart rate back down so uh but yeah he was cutting up he was wanting some couldn't go two days like chicken I've seen him on the message back later and told him I said I'll bring you some chicken if you need something we have to steal it and sneak it in I don't think they put it in the IV bags yet you can't get a chicken leg through the IV so he might want to try though he'd try anything if he goes two days without chicken he'd be sicker than he was when he went in the hospital so good to be in the house of the Lord good to have brother Russ with us and most of you know who he's is but who he is but the ones that don't know he's from Minnesota and that spelled with a s OD a on the end of it not Minnesota Minnesota ah he's from he's from Minnesota uh okay he just came from eleven inches of snow so coming down here as a culture shock for him I checked the temperatures like fifteen degrees up there mmm you're going back okay sixty down here and Steen in his house so they just remember also brother Chris long he sent me a picture eight feet drift 41 inches of snow in 24 hours is the most I've ever had in a 24-hour period nice 41 inches of snow plus eight foot drifts he sent me a picture of place where he's got his car and you it's almost up to the top of the car thing that you'd like a little portable carport so then he sent me another one of him standing outside and you can see the stop sign and the stop signs here and the snows about that far below the stop sign piled up so and that wasn't the drift that was the real thing so just remember them in your prayers cuz mm-hmm they're not gonna be getting out for a little while it's kind of hard to shovel that kind of snow with showin if you like brother Russ he's got an 80 horsepower track hoe bobcat and he just pushes everything out of the way you know so so that's the and it's heated and air conditioned so he doesn't have to get cold but bless his heart also remember on April the 13th put this down you calendar we will have our Spring Fling I know I announced it for the 27th but we couldn't get that date it was already filled so April the 13th we will have our Spring Fling down at the city park in Gil's Ville so keep that in your mind and and we'll get everything together and we always do everybody does wonderful job I want to thank brother Joe and sister Rachel if she had anything to do with it for you gonna have anything doing it the pictures did you do you did a little bit I kissed her a photoshopping her hair cuz it's really dark in the pictures really dark in the pictures so but I one thing brother Joe and sister Rachel we're taking the pictures and and photoshopping hey it's something they do that we don't see he sets at home and they said at home and they they get this thing ready to put it on the slideshow I really appreciate them I appreciate all the support everybody gets we wouldn't do we could not do this without you and without you we can't even preach we gonna preach to people pray stead the man you got out people to receive it all so you know so revelation 6 verse twit excuse me verse 12 let's go to Lord in prayer Heavenly Father thank you Lord today for coming among us in a way of anointing that that you your word will be anointed in our hearts Lord and then our ears and our eyes that we may truly see you and understand who you are and what you're doing in this time Lord we pray this you just be with each one that's not here be with the ones on the highways be with the ones Lord that are since a glory right now below my feet there's many many names on a wall that we put up years ago that we're praying Lord that you'll touch each one on that wall and that you'll save their soul father and give them whatever they need Lord that you will bless them and Lord bring them in the fold as times getting short father just be with us and forgive us of our sins thank you for all the things you've given us be with the missionaries on the foreign fields give them fruit for that labor father just take care of us lead us and guide us by your Holy Spirit in Jesus name we pray amen now I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal although there was a great earthquake and the Sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when it rolled together and every mountain and Island were moved out of the places now remember this is all natural things it's not human beings involved in this except except they get they get the bad part all right ok so it and we're going to get to that because I don't know I don't think brother Dale told you that but the Jubilee year that's what we're looking at the Jubilee that's what we're heading toward the two prophets are gonna ring in that Jubilee year that the Jubilee year was just for the land sure people went went free but that was for the land to rest so the Jubilee is for the land not the earth this land to rest we're going to have a thousand years of Jubilee rest time with time still going on and Israel is gonna celebrate their Jubilee and the lands gonna rest this land is gonna rest that all right amen we'll get to it maybe in just a minute the kings of the earth heaven departed as a scroll that was rolled together and every mountain and Island were moved out of their places the kings of the earth and the great men the rich men the chief captains and the mighty men and every bondman and every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains I said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath is come and who shall be able to stand you may be seated in the Lord a blessing to the reading his words we're gonna put this chart up we're not gonna use it right this moment but we're gonna brother Danny's help we're gonna and I found something downstairs that we might but just release them since you could see it better so we're gonna try I don't want by I don't what I do with it I don't want in no way to think I want to write in pink but to get in touch with my masculine if I can find a thing what I do with it oh yes can you see this you see that better than you can double a black lace huh no never mind Plan B Danny if I had one I'd use it I don't have a plan I have a plan mate I thought this was gonna work we're not throw that oh dear Lord I don't want Sarah to step on it that would look good walking out down the aisle right now maybe we'll use it and write black on it too but I want to uh I want everybody to see it that was my whole purpose so but maybe what is it the glare if you do that maybe ah okay well maybe we'll uh we'll work on something we'll get our lighting crew to work on that we'll find one somewhere there when he bikes he's downstairs okay the lighting guys downstairs all right so now let's cuz I want to show you let me do this that what we're talking about is you've got to look at this whole thing as we're going through seven seals one two three five six seven Church ages right we've got and we're finished with seven Church ages so we've had the fifth sixth seal after the rapture right but we get the benefits of five and six all right we get the benefits we get one through four rapture takes place but you can't do away with five and six because you've got to bring five and six back down to cover as we were talking last night when we get into the part of our part of the sixth seal it's going to be something that's never happened before and when we leave there's gonna be happened because the Bible says man ain't gonna be able to - even you can realize what's gonna happen the chaos that's gonna happen after we leave this place amen well you can't believe the chaos that's gonna happen to this guy before we leave this place because something's got to happen that no one on earth has ever done there has never a born-again believer stood on the earth and did not have to die to take a body change even Jesus had to die everybody's had to die but there's somebody gonna be on this earth that his nature is going to be so disrupted or interrupted that there's going to be so abnormal but yet it's going to happen it's a promise that's going to happen so we know it's going to happen but you and I must get because remember six seals finishes Redemption what we were talking about the other day all right six seals set finished or did you say well once - seven there's nothing it's silence there's nobody moving there's no there's no player there's no there's no you know moon and sun and you see all these other things there's a set up in the play in the acts of a play there's always a backdrop there's always props Seventh Seal silence silence in heaven for space of a half an hour silence nothing nothing moving brother Brahim said nothing going on so what is we're get to the Seventh Seal maybe when we get back from the Philippines the Seventh Seal is what takes this book remembering revelations 5mm takes the book what's the book it's not the Bible it's a book of names your name brother Brown said one time he said John saw his name in the book what book the book that the father had on the throne in his hand while this seventh seal Son of Man made his intercessory work in the church ages then when that's over with he comes and takes the sixth seal book and redeems it takes possession because remember the Lamb of God is not the son of God in that part that's the Son of Man the Son of Man is the Lamb that's the flesh God all right we were talking about that this morning a little bit in the sunday-school class we're into the book of Hebrews now we finished with Roman so we're in the book of Hebrews and man the first we can't get past three verses in 45 minutes so I I would ask you to maybe look at that and see because I've always said Satan loves to keep what keep us separated divide and conquer he does not want you to realize that you're God Almighty in human flesh he don't worry he doesn't want you to realize that because when the bride realizes who she is not who she's going to become it's not like that we're just going to become something no you already kernel is eternal is eternal you can't make eternal up here and eternal down here and degrees of eternal if you're born again today you're just as eternal as God is because you're not a second part of God you are God made manifest in another form called the bride God has decided to M morphe into you you say that's just radical if God decided it he makes no is it with me rest on my last no there's no God doesn't do something go not sure the don't that way you know we do that that's that's us all every day but God doesn't go something do something to go knock I shouldn't have done that Lord I look down brother calling there's a person under your seat I thought you had purse oh it's Rebecca Rebecca that's just Rebecca's first scared me there for a minute talking about pink and getting touch with your feminine side well that's alright Riley's been with us for behind me 150 years yes I'm I get set in the same place real solid guide in the church - I'm telling you real solid guy real solid brother but what was I told me God in him whatever you want me to talk about right but that six sealed book though is the is the seven churches because all this happens in the church ages even five and six then the spiritual part we get is still in the church ages thereby alright with that you got now the natural steel breaks when we leave we're not here when the state Steel Brakes natural seal but you and I are totally under the sixth seal for your body changed for the nature because you really you had a nature change when you got born again right the old nature is dead and you become alive in Christ well now that's that's the inside of the inside that's the soul all right that's the soul but now God is working on that spirit room because there was a spirit giving you which it became a fallen nature because you're in this fallen condition right amen and then your body must be under falling condition we sure are getting a lot older but remember if you're born again I tell sister Clete all the time she's 92 years 92 years old she's ninety-two years old but she doesn't look it and actually doesn't act it at all good everybody say a man doesn't act like it at all but she's closer to 20 years old than we are you got a seat seat but now that's abnormal you know you told them that in Sunday school I'm working on a sermon what the world thinks it's normal we say is abnormal what we say is normal like that thinking that the world laughs look I can go idiot she's getting older know as a Christian she's getting younger we're heading toward a body change we're heading toward what's already inside of us that's the problem with the world the world this is not in my nose but the world can't see God but your God inside of you is a young person working in the auspice of the Word of God feeding on the Word of God listen when you go to McDonald's and eat you're not feeding your soul your feet amen brother then you're not feeding your soul here's where you feed your soul you're feeding this natural body so that it keeps the soul inside and that's kind of strange that's kind of strange that we're eating to try to keep this guy alive to keep the eternal part that's inside of us from leaving us I mean come on when I start doing things but look I mean that do you do you think that way the world don't the world don't that thinks we're crazy but we are every day heading toward a younger condition but now look we're not heading toward it we're in it thank you it's inside of us that's why me we're not looking for a theophany that's young out here and we're all over here that theophanies inside it can't do you any good standing over there but it's what's gonna change your body it's what's already inside of you what's gonna change you everything you need for your journey the prophet of God said is right there in you and that's what the seals I believe that's what the seals are telling us when we look at these two prophets these two prophets do what this morning we were talking this morning I read the scripture in John one I said in the beginning was rough in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God put your name in there because you are the Word made flesh aren't you verse 114 says and the Word was made flesh oh that was Jesus okay at one time he fulfilled that but because he fulfilled that now you and I can fulfill that and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us now we know that's talking about Jesus but you and I got to see that that same one as saying you didn't lose the title when he that same one that was walking on the shores of Galilee didn't lose the title when he went inside of you he's still God and when he went inside of you he didn't become a West regards what I'm trying to say he didn't become a lesser god no he became a greater God because that's exactly the way we're going back to we're getting back to that everybody all right well that same am all right so so when I say who's going to take a rapture and you say now that meant you said no you're exalting yourself be careful folks if God's inside of me who the minds open if you think this flesh is going to do it you're in trouble but if the one inside of me we let him do it but but you can't separate it ever again once he comes in and gets in your soul that's God and you together brother Ram said there's persons he said vulcanized what is vulcanized it's not rubbing and and cloth it's two pieces of cut on people it's two pieces of rubber that has you can't tell them apart that's what you you and God in your soul today bottling you birth it's not it's not plastic over here rust and rubber over here God now he didn't exchange her soul but he sure changed it to rubber so that when he comes that's why it takes the Holy Ghost and fire remember the old cubes you had to heat them tubes up right with what fire yeah you got oh yeah sorry darling you're right they might know even one up inner tube is some of young kids they go - energy every tire used to have an inner tube in it and that inner tube is what held them brother house laughing even the oldies that goes oh we fixed that many times cause you fix them at home but you know what you got to do first oh you don't just brush them no no I remember daddy had a little thing about that big and it was it had spines on it and you'd have to rough it up to make it rough hello he not the on Sunday and Wednesday he'd have to make it rough but he would roughing that up and then what you put a little glue then you take fire and you light it actually sometimes the glue would like ignite and light and that heated it up I'm just doing this for the kids because all your ones are doing this and the kids are going and then you would take a patch that was the same material God the same material and when you put it together like that it literally melted and it was stronger than anything around that tube Indian part of the other rubber because you had double rubber now that's being God we double rubber together you can quote me on that but that's what he done but see that's not patching it up that's making it past new because you got an old tube the rest of the tubes old but when you put that patch on it it's usually about that much thicker than the rest of the tire but you can't you know unless you just didn't do it right which god doesn't not do it right you might get a patch it comes off but most of the time the tires gonna blow somewhere else I'm telling this for a spiritual part too for the older ones there's another part that might blow out and you know but but most of the time but it was rubber and rubber you didn't go get a wood patch and put it on a rubber it won't balkanize but brother Branham says it vulcanize --is us together so why don't we believe that we're vulcanized with God and just let him do the work let go and let God we say that many many times but why don't we do that no we get down and we do like I do sometimes we try to do 1 plus 1 is 2 and 2 times 2 is forward and we try to figure it all out let's just listen to what God has for us cuz if he's inside of you he's the one that's gonna talk to you ok alright so in the but in the sales when we see this 6 sealed book of redemption for you and I and then we'll get to the ceiling just a second but that 6 sealed book of redemption that book is sealed with six seals now like brother Dale said Jesus already preached 6 seals they've already been preached the books already in other words the books already there your names already in that book but it takes the seventh seal which there's only one seal grieve not me bro remember when we first started this a year ago I read to you what a seal was the Bible says grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are until the day of your redemption that's the only seal there is because without the baptism of the Holy Ghost today without your soul being sealed in you cannot understand what I'm talking about oh you can get parts of it if you're not born again and it will bring you to a level to get born again but what I'm saying is is when you get to this seat up to the six seals you've got the whole book you're not just milk is telling them downstairs and I'll tell you I I'm not looking for the last seed to come in see there there's now now we're gonna be abnormal in the message register we're gonna be abnormal in the message now make sure people are gonna be going down what where's Bob black big what Oh Bob we'll say something you go do what he's off preaching for brother crocheting he's always way back home I'm sure so just pray for him I'm sure they had a good time but you come to a place though that that last seed cannot be a baby if we're gonna take a rapture that last one that everybody's looking for has got to be a mature person it can't be a baby so he's got to be taught he or she whoever has got to be taught the Word of God because God's not gonna rapture babies he raptures full-grown people especially if they're gonna take a body change they got to be fully mature so what I'm saying is we may have already got to last see that person may be sitting in a service one day somewhere no I don't have to be here but somewhere and what he moves up just a little bit higher he or she they move up just a little bit higher and then all of a sudden God says okay you're at the place where I can take them all now see so I look at it a little bit different to me that's abnormal to most what people thought people think like I said many times before I'm not looking and don't even I a rapture to me as an event we've got to have the dead come out of the ground first we've got to have a body change before the rapture so why is everybody I'm looking for a rapture that's an event on the calendar but you better be ready you got to get ready before that time comes I'm seeing the rapture no I want to see your body change because if I see in a rapture might mean I have to die hmm see what I mean I'm still working on some of these things that are kind of odd to us that we may have all these years you know you know for all these years they've said now now brother Gary Adkins he's passed on he's he's sitting at Jesus's feet walking on streets to go no that's not true that's not true but now how many times you've been told that your whole life basically man's denomination know if you've been in a mess but you in the denominational it's my mama's right there defeated you know she's not that's not true they're in the sixth dimension we know that they're in a very happy and a wonderful place but there's things gotta happen before all that comes to being you said well you just been too technical you're the one that's gonna have to make it come to pass you better if you won't want to get technical you better get technical cuz without you coming to a body change they're going to stay in that dimension okay all right I mean really it's wonderful to know these things but the present-day truth is what you're not that's why I am is gonna take a rapture but I am just gonna have to have a body change first so who's gonna take a body change you say I am well you hear this you that's not exalted that's not saying I'm gonna do this if you know the correct way it's God gonna do it but he's gonna do it through you and I didn't decide that he did I just accepted what he said what he's already saying amen so let's read let's read a few quotes we're gonna kind of kind of review just a second I'm gonna skip a bunch of this and then get to the to the end and then kind of bring something about did you believe that I think I'll help you understand more what brother nails tell me this morning number one is thick steel now the earthquake cuz listen folks this is for you this is for you all this is for you it's for it's for all of us to come to that place I don't want to be a prophet too right now and know what all you were thinking thank God and all of you are gonna say man you should not have think about what I just did okay anyway I just exposed ya hear no evil see no evil we can't help what we think we're human beings but we can do something about the thought that we have man even Jesus had I was telling him downstairs you know Jesus was around Mary Magdalene for years and she's the prostitute you don't think he saw things but remember he was clean he didn't have to have a statue of bourbon man he was the statue a perfect man but you know what he's told us the way to get to it it's not like we're putting him way up in we can't reach it no he's not that King came down here to live among us to teach us how to do that the stature of a perfect man that wasn't the statue of William Branham that was the statue of a perfect man Jesus Christ I love you go in brother just tremble we're used to preach or he's passed on now but he has a big picture of the cloud over here and remember the some of your old ones remember the picture in the indictment book where brother Brown was pointing his finger like this Ryan died this generation and it's a black-and-white picture of him standing to pulpit brother Jessica's got that picture of him doing this and the cloud and he's pointing to the cloud and he said a true prophet will point you to Christ every time and that's the way it is he pointed us to Christ that's why I don't I don't get muddled up and if brother Branham was right or wrong or he brought us the Word of God he was a prophet he was supposed to bring it to us he was supposed to leave the scene and he was given a commission to give it to a group of people and he did give it to us he did what he was supposed to do now what are we going to do about it is our business we can take it and forget it like a lot of people are doing or we take it and we can move it right on to the coming of the Lord compare Scripture this great event that we will see this great secret of mystery that was under the sixth seal of the book of Redemption so remember anytime you see a book that book in the Bible six seals has it sealed okay because look it's the sixth sealed book of redemption I'm reading what the prophet said now remember these are hidden mysteries and the six seals all together is one great big book just sit Scrolls roll together and it unwinds the whole book of redemption that's how the whole earth was redeemed and we'll get into revelations five later on about all that so let's go to number two all right now this six seal now what we're looking here look what is this keep not throw something at it so the Tribulation Period is here right after we leave so the sixth seal is the Tribulation Period the seal itself is the Tribulation Period all right that's what takes place the bride has gone no living creature in other words there's no holy ghost on the earth they said well it's going to fall in 144,000 and two now God's not dealing with the church no more it's done gone he's dealing with Israel this is the other side this is when Israel receives the message of the kingdom by the two problems of Revelations 11 remember their eyes are blind to today the Bible tells us that their eyes are literally blinded until we get out of here when we leave God will lift that veil off of their eyes and they'll see Christ through those two prophets so we're holding up the whole thing because we can't be here he can't have a bride here and then calls the tribulation to happen and then go to the Jews we got to be gone Joseph's wife Gentile wife was in the palace when he revealed himself to his brethren the Jews remember he married him he married a girl in Egypt right while he was down there and but he sent that Gentile wife back to the palace when he revealed itself same thing with God revealing himself to the Jews we must be out of here we must leave this place we cannot be here when he goes to the Jews remember Israel is a nation God's servant nation to win when Israel is brought in it'll be a national affair Israel the kingdom age is when David the son of David sits on the throne I'll keep that in your mind just for a minute all right let's go to number three go through this real quick I want to skip a few things well we know the six seals of judgement seal because even remember look at me just a minute even the even the foolish virgin we were talking about this life even the foolish virgin has to go through this time of judgment right they're not born again they may be totally justified they may be totally sanctified but either some preacher blinded their eyes or something happen that they didn't get the Holy Ghost okay that's why you have to really know you got a Holy Ghost filled preacher because you can only go as high as your pastor you should whole ever passes born-again hold on what's this know everywhere I like what brother Russ said he said you know he said the devil's got a file full ministry - you ever thought about that he's a copycat right he's a copycat if God's got five true file it's got five fold ministry that's true Satan's got listen if you preach false doctrine that's not God that's just beer you know that's not God but he does have a true fivefold ministry because he said it would perfect the Saints so I'm going to go with take the Bible what the Bible said about it alright well we know the state sells a judgment seal so they're going to get their judgment while we're gone so you and I hallelujah I told you I said what great revelation is that we don't have to go through this the brides gone we're out of here before this starts you think we're having judgment now go home and look in refrigerator yeah it's bad job go get in your $80,000 car and go the house might show heated seats and you heat it staring well boy we're going through some birds ignition yeah thing no you don't want to be here when this happened now here's the breaking fourth of the judgment upon the people we're out of this tribulation judgment will come forth 144,000 redeemed Jews now remember God will not speak and we'll get into this maybe if I have time to read one of the reasons they've never celebrated a Jubilee year it's because they've never all been in the homeland you cannot remember I told you it was land during a Jubilee a year the land has to rest with the people all of I'll read it to you all of Israel all 12 tribes have to be in Jerusalem before letting celebrated Jubilee here so what's gonna happen in the Millennium all twelve tribes are coming together well this is perfect I mean it really just helps a lot to just keep digging and keep reading and see how God's gonna do this thing here's the breaking forth of the judgment upon the people they'll come forth 144,000 redeemed Jews I'll prove it to you they're Jews are not Gentiles they have nothing to do with the bride not a thing see what like we were talking about we done seen the bride gone you can't place that else anywhere else don't come back into the nineteenth chapter of the book of would no less for a book of revelations for the sick cells of judgment still the word but you have to remember to like we were talking about things that were told week in most denominations they've everybody seen the movie left behind you've seen the movie left behind okay well what if you hadn't seen the movie left behind that's what it means that means there's a rapture already took place and you're left behind but you can get saved after you've been left behind because the denominational world says there's a seven-year tribulation period ask brother Dale he'll tell you the Baptist believed there's three and a half year minor tribulation and three and a half years of major tribulation and you can make it through the minor tribulation if you're not whatever they call it but I told him I said the Antichrist shows up at the end of the movie I said no the Antichrist started in the first of the movie to tell them people that they were okay if there hey if we miss the first one you'll get the second one no you're not because remember the second resurrection after that it's judgement resurrection everybody raises at that time you want to be in the blessed are those that come in the first resurrection that doesn't have part in the second the second is is after the thousand years everybody comes up for judgment you don't want to be in that one but see how see how the devil has taught that doctrine in the denominational Church so they're not so you and I or should be so on edge to make the body change so on edge to make a resurrection but if you were in the denominational world you kind of got a little leeway if you don't make right is it right it's not and he's been going through this trying to talk to some of the nomination people well you know it ain't such a big deal because if I miss the first one I'll just make the second one no you missed the first one you think he'll it's gonna be bad you won't be alive on the earth when all these things happen and anything going to be good but the sixth seal is a judgment seal of the word of God all right revelations 11 I'm just gonna paraphrase it because we know what it is we know it's two prophets prophesy 1260 days is that all right we should know that and it's the and it's the Ministry of Moses and Elijah because they shut up the heaven that it rain not in the days of their prophecy which is three and a half years same way with Elijah and water turned to blood we know that Moses did that to the Nile River what a stink oh you think that was horrible to smell that and it's not to earth with all plagues as often as they will all right and then they're gonna be killed and then they're gonna be caught up in a resurrection thereby okay with that don't have to read it number four excuse me we're still in the sixth seal what can bring these things by the word they can do nature any way they want here it is they're the one who brings on this sixth seal they uncover and open it up he's talked about the two prophets it's the power of God to interrupt nature see the sixth seal is completely and then corruption of nature so it's totally abnormal normal is what we're dealing with but that's totally abnormal when you've got two men standing there and all of a sudden like I said the Mossad comes to bring an army to destroy him and they just go ground open up swallow them up and you know and it's done they're gone this others they try to poison them they set their dream to gallons and it doesn't bother him they can't kill them till them 1260 days is over with which I said normal to the world but if they just read the Bible they'd be really normal them two prophets are not gonna die for 1260 days I don't care what you try to do to the sea Satan Satan Satan reads that and he don't believe it he just don't believe it if he believed it he said I'm just done I'm finished you know I'm this is that do you get it there's your seal so now there's your seal we're gonna talk about that today and then we'll move on to the seal compared to us next Sunday for a little while but this is the seal the seal is those two prophets on the other side of the rapture and as we've said before it took a profit on this side of the rapture brother branham it took a profit on this time of the rapture to tell us these things he prophesied of what was coming but to word together with the power of God the Word of God they just condemned nature they can send earthquakes turn the moon to blood Sun can go down anytime at their command amen there you are there you are see how the seals opened down there in the church age how it showed the martyrs now here's these two prophets standing here with the Word of God to do anything to nature they want to do and they shake the earth it shows exactly you does it Moses and Elijah cuz their ministry impersonated both men oh my do you see it see what the sixth seal is it's those two prophets now notice don't let it choked you but watch what happens open that seal prophets there you are over living in the eagle day brother hit him up the clouds they open that sixth seal they have power to do it there's your sixth seal coming open if you'll notice if you've read your sixth seal brother brother said I had to get up and walk out of the room something struck me what was it that struck him he noticed what he was doing it took a profit to open the seal it takes two prophets to open the sixth seal after we're gone but it took a profit in the end time to a Gentile Church to get us to see the spiritual part of the seal so that you and I can have an interruption of nature our nature and that we can be changed and be taken in the rapture and this doesn't apply to us this does not apply we're not going to be here all right this is this is part of the cleaning up of the earth all right let's go to then we're going to Daniel remember last 1994 laughs Russ kind of got onto me for being so would you say been so adamant about what I was talking about about this well I'm telling you here we go with normal abnormal in the message mode people in the message believe that doesn't only three and a half years left of the day and seven weeks at the end after the rapture but that is not true that's a lot the Bible says there's a seven years left so you go are you with the Bible I'm just gonna let you go you bring me any quote you want to normal senior right back to the Bible then okay that's been if that's been dogmatic that's okay I'll take the word any day any day I'll take what the word says over what anybody says but right here answers your question daddy told me that's many many years ago he said read if you don't understand I'm sending each read the six full purpose 70 weeks are determined seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and the city see our problem is we stop with the people but that city's got to be rebuilt hey man the city's got to be rebuilt to do six things finish the transgression not of the city of the people make an end of sins to the people not to the city to make reconciliation for iniquity now it says to bring in everlasting righteousness we're gonna bring it into the city seal up the vision and prophecy we're going to be right the north among so we're gonna be right there in that city and to anoint the most holy brother Brown said the most holy is us in the city so wait a minute seventy weeks has them this is all of it right here seventy weeks are determined not sixty nine and a half so the three and a half year your ministry of the prophets take you this red right here and then the last half I've told you many times before you can't bring in everlasting righteousness goes if you say as most people in the message say that after the 1260 days the Daniel seventy weeks is over that's not according to this because you stop it right here all right you stop it right here these other three has got to happen inside that seventy weeks so to north the most holy which is us into the Millennial temple there's got to be more time left after everybody thinks it's supposed to end right so there's seven years left after the rapture but there's only three and a half years of Jesus's ministry left I explained that the other day there was three and a half over here when when Jesus walked on the earth right pay attention to this there was three and a half to the prophets two prophets right let me do three-and-a-half all right got that now what is that that means that a seven seven two weeks equals seven years brother branham compiled all of the seventy weeks of Daniel in that three and a half years of ministry of Jesus when he was on earth and three and a half year ministry to the two witnesses all right right 1260 days over here 1260 days over here that's all that's left amen and when did they show up the last half of that week he's talking about the Messiah week he always calls it the Messiah week but you can't take away what the Bible said there's one week left after the rapture and even the last sermon he preached was not the 70 weeks of Daniel it was the 70th week that whole sermon that lasts of the three books he preached read your title it says the 70th week not - not this half of half of the 70th week I'm telling you you just not getting what he's talking about everybody thinks that he changed it in the seals he never changed nothing in the seals he said I told you always gonna have to get rid of this before we got to it so if you got a problem go back to the Bible I'm just gonna start telling you to read what the Bible says and he shall make a comfort he will shall confirm the covenant with many for one week that's after we're gone that's right here for how long one week all right so there's one week left after the rapture there's only three and a half years of ministry there's only three and a half years of the tribulation but there's seven years left to get us into millennium because right here starts the millennium it doesn't start right here the millennium starts right here there by all right with that if you not then go back to the Bible all right so now let's skip number five let's read number six go to number six good good job feast of the trumpets now we got to get to the Feast of Trumpets Pentecost feast finishes at the period of the seventh trumpet for the next is the coming of the seventh seal for the next is the mystery of the coming of Christ and also the trumpet is sound for the Jews everybody settle down just a minute there sixth trumpet is sound and when it does it makes known to them the revealed Son of God now what happens after six seals are revealed to me and you what does it reveal Christ when their sixth when the sit when the trumpet sound the sixth this is the seven trumpets all I'm sound under the sixth seal well they all sound while these two prophets are known earth and we read them last Sunday they okay with it some of your their sixth trumpet is sound and when it does it makes known to them the reveal Son of God not the seventh because we're going to read next Sunday maybe we'll read the seventh trumpet the seventh trumpet to the Jews is the same as the seventh seal to us the kingdoms of our Lord have become the kingdoms of his Christ and we should rule and reign forever man because that happens because six seals finishes Redemption there's no more Redemption after the door closes there's the Redeemer but this is the Redemption he doesn't need to be redeemed not now his body did though Jesus his body was not eternal it had to be made eternal his body had to be redeemed I read you the quote where brother mom said that remember several months ago brother Brown said eternal life he inherited now Jesus Christ didn't inherit eternal life in his soul in the spirit we know that or he was just a mortal man but he inherited eternal life in his body when he come out of that tomb he said all power in heaven there's been given unto me that was redeemed body God so what's gonna happen to you same thing yes why we're we separated well they can happen to in Jesus but he can't happen to mean well you're in bad shape you're in bad shape hey he was garden he died but being gone and dying you don't have to die remember all trumpets sound on this sixth seal so all those trumpets we read last Sunday in Revelations 8 and 9 they sound while these two prophets are on the earth the sixth seal finishes the mystery under the sixth seal just before the seventh is open now this is piece of the trumpet he preached this after the seals so he knows what he's talking about just before the seventh is open all right there by ok with that then we read let's just not read the let's go to number seven that way we'll skip a lot of this for time go to number seven we read them last Sunday it's exactly the Tribulation Period you know what happened all the woes came and although the first Brethren brother Dale talked about this morning the first woe was first world war ii was the second world war and we hadn't had the third wheel yet because that's the third world war alright they're ok with that brother Brown said woes mean war alright now this calling of the Feast of Trumpets the approaching of something notice revelations 8 7 if you're gonna write it down we noticed the first trumpet they're scattered hail blood fire upon the earth just exactly with the Exodus you see what happen is what I told you this seal has been spoken of way back in the in in the Old Testament because the seals tie the entire Bible together so the the bringing of Israel out or the bringing of Israel out of the in the Exodus out of Egypt is exactly the same thing hail blood fire upon the earth just exactly the Exodus when God was calling his people out of the Exodus remember that was the first Exodus then now we're in the 3rd Exodus it's not going to be a coming out of Egypt as far as us all being in bondage not spiritual spiritual bondage is what we got to come out I I'd he'd rather be in natural bondage they've been spiritual bondage you say oh boy no I'd rather be in natural bondage then to being a spiritual bondage because that means you're bound now the reason that these seven trumpets does not apply to this church in this age is because it's to Israel only because we're Gentiles listen when when if there was a Gentile in Israel during these feast days they could come and watch but they couldn't participate Gentiles can't participate so we can't protect if those trumpets blew to Israel if you were a Gentile you just went what was that but the Jews knew exactly what that sound was because they were called under the Feast of the trumpets right so God is calling his people out of the exodus now the reason that these seven trumpets don't apply to this church and the ages because it's the Israel it's the calling of the gathering of the people now there's only one significance in here that I want you to get to in a few minutes it's where you'll see why this doesn't apply to this age that we're living the seven trumpets remember he started talking about he wanted to preach the trumpets and God wouldn't let him why because it's not to us nice to the Jews the gathering of Israel is the trumpets the trumpets is together Israel notice the very first trumpet sound blood fire hail everything scattered the ground Seif what was he doing bring Israel out of spiritually back into his homeland now let us say this here that even that every trumpet that blowed blown under the sixth seal so they're all going to blow at the time of that three-and-a-half year ministry of the two prophets because they are the seal and all trumpets sound of the sixth seal we'll get to in a few minutes where we caught the seal there all the trumpets sounded under the sixth seal thereby all right now look number eight then we'll get into kind of what brother Dale was telling us this morning now notice the trumpet sounded and that was to gather them together now the first trumpet blows there was Hellfire sprayed on the earth just exactly like it was in Egypt making ready to call them to the Day of Atonement they were calling them to the day of atonement all right everybody got that now remember the day of atonement was not the Passover the Passover is the killing of the Lamb the day of atonement was to separate yourself and and realize that something had already been killed in your stead and you were having a day to where you were honoring that all right because remember Israel has not come to their Day of Atonement yet so Crocs don't have to go get back on the cross it's not the it's not the the feast of Passover and then they're looking at the feast of atonement which they're going to say he already died you already killed that lamb in your country amen they rejected the true atonement and this year has been lengthened out through here has been the year Pentecost now look this has been the year of Pentecost actually the literal day of Pentecost is when the Holy Ghost fell the literal day of Pentecost the fiftieth day and we've been living to a degree under that because we've all had a Pentecost but now at the end we go to the Feast of Tabernacles cause Tabernacles is in gathering it's bringing everybody together amen so we're reading just a second these years has been lengthen out through here and it's been the year of Pentecost now look see Israel that's never had a day of Pentecost they've never received the Holy Ghost now they had a day of Pentecost their day where they do whatever do you know actually the Pentecost feast of Pentecost is called the feast of weeks because it's seven sevens is 49 and then the extra day is there 50 it's called the feast of weeks look it up in your in your in your history it's not in the Bible it does say feast of weeks in the Bible but it is to feast Pentecost call this 49 plus 1 makes 50 we'll get to that in just a second because we've come to our fifty when you get born again you're not in a 49 you're at a fifty you have come to your Jubilee year we just haven't finished it yet because this thing hasn't gone free yet but we're getting to it we're actually in it we're in it this has been the calling out of the church what those years of the Feast of Pentecost is where he called the people out the calling out feast of weeks seven look at me seven times seven forty-nine Church ages ages but you and I have to come to a fifty all right no I'll prove that team just second now then the calling out of the church watch real close now which afterwards he took them to the land of promise took him after what the moment they took him to land the promise which he will do the same thing which in symbol he takes the church see our land two promises the Word of God Israel's land of promise is that part over there past the Mediterranean Sea called brother rocks how many times you've been newsroom four times he's been over there that's where we're gonna live that's where we're gonna live that's where the city's gonna push you up from I feel we're gonna live but we're spiritual Israel natural Israel in two millenniums you live in the same place but then God's gonna wipe that all off again because that's temporal that's temporary because you and I are in a temporary dwelling place under 49 that'll make you happy we're not have to be stuck in this thing thank you hallelujah brother I want to get you get you a megaphone when you say hallelujah I want brother Dick's hair to fall forward least he's got something don't all y'all laughs hmm woke up a little bit hey bite wait okay this has been the calling out of the church he's called us out during the feast of Pentecost we've all received the Holy Ghost Israel has not so they're not under that feast they're not in that 50 yet but they're gonna get it they're gonna get a natural time all right watch what number was that number eight number nine all right look no revelations now stick with me for just this 3:30 stick with me just a few minutes now revelation is the night 13th verse you'll notice real close under the sixth trumpet revelations 913 undeceive trumpet there was two hundred thousand horsemen it's actually two hundred thousand thousand we know that horsemen that had been bound in the river Euphrates was turned loose under the sixth trumpet now he goes to explain there's not that many literal horsemen in the world these are demons devils and like I said you know where there are they're right there that river Euphrates remember the Tigris and Euphrates River run right down through the Garden of Eden one bore on one side one on the other them demons with not let us back you thought about that them demons come out of that Tigris and you through the out of the Euphrates River to stop us from going across to the promised land there were two hundred thousand horsemen I want you to jot it down so he can read it they wasn't natural horses they breathe fire they had breastplates of Jasper and they had tails and and what was their tail it was alive it was their ta le not tal the end of the tail looked like a serpent a snake's head hello who tells a lie the serpent snakes head at the end of it stinging it was spiritual horse's spiritual Devils Chargers that had been bound in Euphrates all these years supernatural Devils I'm running out of something to read what was it the old Roman Empire being revived the persecution of the Jews they had been bound nearly 2,000 years that the river Euphrates can't cross the promise a religious sect that was trying to get to the other side your eighties you know came to Eden I think I just did them but they were bound there two hundred thousand demons of persecution and notice what happens under that sixth trumpet they were turned loose on the Jews to do what to drive them back to their land you can't celebrate a Jubilee if you're a Jew and you're out of the country you got to be in the country remember that was three feasts and I can't remember went one of them was the feast of weeks and feast of firstfruits and one other there was three three feast that if you were 20 years old you had to come to Jerusalem every year to celebrate those feasts didn't matter where you live you had to come back to Israel to do that I'll read them later I'm studying home some of that now but there's three feasts that you were required if you were a male Jew you had to go back to the that's why if you'll read your Bible Jesus says the Bible was saying on the day of the feast Jesus was in the temple Jesus went to church and he was there during those feast days and if I would have been Jesus with you I would have probably made people worse man than they did him I'd say I'm the feast I'm the bread he did say that anyway said I'm the bread that come from heaven I am the lamb I am the one he stood in the temple and said I am he but what they were so blinded supernatural Devils nearly 2000 years then loosed on Stalin Hitler upon the Jews they said well that isn't Rome it's the same spirit they'd done the same thing they did to the Christians in the old pagan Roman days now watch the natural Israel and the spiritual church now as we separate it here turned loose on the Jews now brother Brown goes on and continues he said those two hundred thousand thousand demons were loosed on the bride to drive us back to our homeland which is the Word of God we don't have a continuing city or a home road Chris this is not our home all right so now let's go right here to the next one but I want to stop if we get to this we will because right now we are we are under the Feast of Tabernacles which is the last great feast is the Feast of Tabernacles before you cycle back around to the to the Passover their cycle remember downstairs some of you were down there with me we did the calendar when we did the dynasty in two weeks we did the calendar all right and now remember the seventh month is October they're months they're year starts in March April it's not exactly March it's not it's kind of in between March and April but their seventh months from March April May June July August September October so in October the 15th day of the seventh month I got it rode in my Bible you know that's when sister meter when the Lord told sister meter to marry brother Branham in October that's why because where you and I are feasting under the Feast of Tabernacles on the first day shall be a holy compass convocation you showed no do no servile work in other words you take a little time off that okay everybody ought to say Amen take some time off all right let's read this right here let's go to the number 10 I'm gonna read 10 11 and I'm gonna try to hit something real quick what brother Dale was coming out this morning now this is the future home now watch listen it look at me the future home is not under a 7 the future always not on a 49 the future home is a day holy convocation eternity that's why the millennium is not a eight it's a seven an eight is not two now remember when we get into this one I'm fixing to talk to you in a minute about remember this right here there's not eight days in a week never has been even the Beatles sang about eight days a week you know remember that he said I remember that somebody should have said who's the Beatles nobody said that okay but remember you had let's do this one two three four five six seven there was no eighth day you had seven days and then you went back to the first day because they had a roll that back down just for a second see right here well the first day shall be a holy convocation but it was for seven days now this is heading towards what brother Browns reading on because they said brother Ram you ran out of your tops right you're still in the seventh even some of them people knew that if you stayed in the seven if you stay in that cycle it's not eternal but there's an eighth day holy convocation which is the day after the seventh which is the first now you said that does nothing to us it's going to explain why brother Dale's was talking about the do you believe this morning right thought it has everything to do with it because there is no 50th Jubilee outside of the seven sevens is 49 it's hidden that's why that you had 230 430 days there was though 70 days missing called it was 7 70th Jubilee 77 th Jubilee right so anyway let's look at this real quick now remember there are seven feast days to Feast of Trumpets feast of tabernacles feast of sheaf wave all this there's seven great feast days that was only a top of the seven churches even under the Feast of Tabernacles you and I are under it now it will cease when we go into rapture it will cease for us we don't actually go build booths they doing in Israel they build a booth and they sit down in that booth they build oh they build a booth have you seen it they build the booth and they sit in that booth now that's literal but you and I sit in this booth forever how long we got here so that's what it's there types to us that was only top of the seven churches and you remember how many Sabbath's there was between one and the other seven Sabbath's between Pentecost and the trumpets which was the seven Church ages there was seven feast days that represented the seven church ages keep your numbers running you said well now brother Brown you've done run out you got your seven alright let's take the last feast which is the Feast of Tabernacles he reads the 36 verse seven days show you offer offerings made a fire unto the Lord on the eighth day he repeats on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation there is a another holy time coming holy convocation unto you and you shall offer an offering made by fire to the Lord it's a solemn assembly you shall do no servile work therein now we got an eighth day now there is only seven days but here we speak of the eighth day holy convocation convocation notice do no work in it that's why Jesus never spoke of a day we have entered into our rest when you're born again you have entered into your rest you'll never rest no better you shall not know your soul is resting in God we've already entered our 50 but remember that Jubilee is for the land the 50th Jubilee the seven sevens is for everything else the fifties for the land you see what I'm doing this is land all right that's why we must get to that 50 to have our Jubilee a release of this man all right we've already been released in here we went through I hope we've went through the Day of Atonement I hope we went through the feast of firstfruits I hope we went through the Passover that's when the lamb died for you that's when you accepted that feast of Pentecost all right I don't want to confuse you so let's just kind of the eighth day back to the 1st all right so there's no eighth day it goes cycles back to the first day but it is set aside as the eighth day cause it's the holy convocation all right why it speaks of eternity as she rolls around without a stopping place do you see it now notice because right here look this is the church agent it stops then you have a no church age messenger he preaches his message then it stops he preaches his he comes on the scene preaches his message he stops seven times that seven times seven equals what 49 but by receiving the Holy Ghost we have completed the circle and will prove that in just a minute with the Jubilee all right everybody bear with me just to be momentum notice it was also upon this eight day last day feast day of the tabernacle notice after that after the last feast day after the last church age after the last complete seven days upon the earth after the Millennium because millennium is still the earth is still right here in time still rolling through time but now you and I by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and by a body change have taken it into and he's took it into an eighth day so we got our jubilee our land is at rest even our soul is at rest now but our land is gonna be a rest amen well makes me feel good as I get older it makes me feel even better brother dick remember amen remember this is feast of tabernacles Tabernacles the gathering places that's what we're doing we are gathering together unto Him what around the Word of God not around not around a piece of land but Israel has promised a piece of land by people and the holy city well obviously that city's got a set on a piece of land right we're in the Millennium the Bible says they shall build houses and have it you see the difference in the future home future home it's already built for us no building but now in the Millennium there is building that's why a lot of people even brother Russ I think was talking about people don't believe that Ezekiel 42 44 is a literal temple brother Branham said it was it was millennial temple that's going to be built by the Jews for the Millennium because the son of David's got to sit on a throne now that throne is literal because David said on a literal throne and he promised that the that the Israel would not be without the son of David sitting on the throne so in the Millennium there since Jesus on the throne we're there in the honeymoon we're all there but he's sitting on the throne judging the twelve tribes of Israel that's what the Bible says amen in a temple now there won't be any sacrifices at all but what a glorious time we'll have to be able to step in that outer Court and remember when you went through justification stepping that arracourt and remember where you went through sanctification and step into that Holy of Holies and guess what you're gonna see are you gonna see God and then but in the new earth he has already went and prepared the place it's built we have nothing to do with the building of it Amen eternal oh I just love that word a holy convocation the eighth day which is only seven days look it's only seven there's no eighth day but what does it takes and continues to cycle it's the first day back again I'm telling you this for a purpose right because of what brother Dale said this morning which is only seven days then on the eighth day which comes back to the first day again comes right back to the first day the eighth day is the holy convocation notice seven days only has to do with old creation world time seven days that's the Millennium the rest day as God's labored six days he rested the seventh to church labor six days rest the seventh but you're still in time element even in the Millennium you're in a time element alright I ain't speaking of the eternal when he's talking about the Millennium but you see there's no such a thing as eight days you go right back to the first day the first day again alright let's read this last one it's from the future home the feast of tabernacles was the last feast the seventh feast we are worshipping now unto the feast of tabernacles the seven churches in the millennium will be under the feast of tabernacles again in the seventh day but then after the seventh day we have a holy convocation go back into the eternal how by the eternal one that came and redeemed us taking us back letting us recognize that we were a part of this and by all right with that so now let's try to look at something what brother Dale was tell about this morning because look when you have in the old cycle back when we were talking about in Leviticus 25 eight every seven years there was a Jubilee okay every seven years it was a Jubilee now what happened was is in the middle of this sixth year a trumpet sound caused that it's actually not in the total Miller years in October most everything happens on that Sabbath months which is a harvest month I hope you get that which is a harvest month a harvest month when the reapers reap the harvest and puts it in the storehouse I hope you see that all right now look I'm reading this from Wikipedia so it's got to be true all the tech guys are back in the back giggling no listen because it's true watch Jubilee deals largely with land property and property rights everybody set up on the edge of their seat so when you go to sleep you fall over in the Hitchin according to Leviticus slaves and prisoners would be freed debts would be forgiven and the mercies of God would be particularly manifested everybody got that now look this only applies when the Jewish people live in the Land of Israel according to their tribes they've been scattered and dispersed for years hundreds thousands of years they've been dispersed all over the place right amen so they got to come back to the promised land so every seven years all right so let's go I see if you can pull up Leviticus what brother Dale was talking about this morning pull up Leviticus 25 but I want to read you something let me tell you the Bible it's perfect you got your Bible turn to Genesis 29 Genesis 29 now here is Jacob a type of Christ all right now watch Jacob because remember whatever was bought and everything done to you you I'm going back to what brother Dale said we talked about slaves and owners and all this stuff it's not like we think but it proves it right here because remember where did brother Branham get the revelation of one week equals seven years you got out of the Bible if you're not ready we're fixing to all right Genesis 29 you ready verse 17 talking about Jacob finding a bride Leo was tenderized but Rachel was beautiful and wealthy remember Leo was older Israel Rachel was younger type of Gentile but watch what happened and Jacob loved Rachel and said I will serve the seven years he wasn't in slavery he was working towards something he was working toward a wife y'all think a year or two of datin seven years both Holly read what it says though for Rachel the younger one but watch and Laban said it is better that I give her to thee than that I should give her to another man abide with me and Jacob served seven years for Rachel and they seemed unto him but a few days for the love he had for her a thousand years of the day and the day as a thousand years to God he's not he's not he's not he's not overanxious he knows when we're gonna come but he is anxious to see us I'd be anxious to see my bride wouldn't you and Jacob served for Rachel for seven years now how you gonna get one we keep one's equal seven years look at verse 27 oh they got it up here fulfil her week one week equals seven years fulfill her week and we will give need this also for the service now remember the story keep turning over verse 28 and Jacob did so and fulfilled her week what was that week seven years one week equals seven years and Jacob nestling fulfilled her week and gave him Rachel his daughter to why but remember the custom was is you couldn't marry the younger before the older got married so Christ had to marry hello somebody Christ had to marry Laban first the Israel first then he had to get rid of her to marry Rachel hey man not get rid of her but divorced her and Laban gave Rachel his daughter bill his handmaid and he went on into Rachel and he loved he went in also under Rachel and he loved also Rachel more than Leah and served with him yet seven more years in other words what happened Laban he's a he's a con man like brother Ernie Berlin Villanueva said he said that was to con me and working against each other Jacob was a shyster and Laban with a con man so they was they were conning each other because remember what happened was he gave him Rachel but when he sent him in on the wedding night it must have been real dark because Lea's the one that got in there with with Jacob and he realized that the next morning and said hey you give me the wrong woman and then Laban says hey I can't give you the younger without giving you the older first so Jacob had to work seven more years this guy was 14 years for he could have Rachel but you know what God needed that bride he needed me and you he worked seven church ages to get to us you know and then he worked seven other years and when the Lord saw that leah was hated he opened up her womb but Rachel was barren now we know the whole story but look fulfill her week one week is seven years so Jacob worked seven years God worked through seven Church ages seven times seven seven years for Leah seven years for Rachel but if you put it in our the way we look at it seven times seven is forty-nine so he got a natural wife though but we're talking about spiritual here so let's look at that I want to show you something Israel just for a bi okay shake yourself just for me all right look so ever seven years there was a release then you had ever seven Sabbath's seven times seven equals 49 that's 49 years from one Sabbath seven times cycle is called a cycle it's called a Jubilee cycle if you ever want to look at look up Jubilee cycle alright but what happens is here's the whole story this is what's going to make it all sound good when you had seven when you come to the 49th year can you pull up Leviticus 25 8 we'll wait just a minute you cheated you pulled up what brother branham what brother Dale had this morning that's that's fine that's smart that's not cheating that's smart now look the is 25 18 thou shalt number seven Sabbath's 7 times 7 49 years then thou shalt cause the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound look here's your 40 let's just say this is your 49th year let's just put this down here you're on your own year 49 in your 49th year in October not at the 1st of the year not at the last of the year but in October and thou shalt number seven Sabbath's then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the Jubilee and you're not in the Jubilee year yet you got a lap over you got a lap over you got a lap it back the Jubilee the sound on the tenth day so on October the 10th there's gonna be a jubilee get ready get ready in the Day of Atonement so you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and ye shall hallow the fiftieth year you blew the trumpet in October of 4 49th year then you proclaim to Liberty on the fiftieth year now the problem with Israel was they never celebrated that they celebrated the seventh oh yeah it was easy every 7 years you'd let a few people go free you keep a few people you get rid of a little bit of land you can have a little bit of land now but on the 50th according to the Bible everybody poverty and rich went just like this and Jews are never gonna do that not the natural Jew so they never celebrated that 50th Jubilee they've never celebrated a natural Jubilee it's all in history I've read history I've read ten different commentaries no one has ever said that Israel did what the 50th Jubilee was said to do and that was to give everything back everybody it doesn't matter if you had 15 cars but if you bought five from this guy you had to give him five back if you bought 14 horses from this guy you had to give them 14 horses back so that he had 14 and everything comes equal see now that happens to me and you on our fiftieth year and you shall hallow the fiftieth then proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof and it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man unto his possession and you shall return every man unto his family now I want to prove something to you right here real quick and then we'll close we're brother Dale was talking about because it might be a little strange for some of you mm-hmm is that when you come to the 49th year everybody okay well that the jubilee trumpet sounded not to jubilee but now remember you never had a fiftieth year the priest counted seven times seven when you come up to the 49th year he said all right the next year will be a jubilee a year but it's not an extra year because you couldn't have you thirty four hundred thirty years as brother I'm said if you had an extra year put in there what was that this is so good what was the Jubilee a year it was the first year of the next cycle so they lapped over the church ages lapped over it was a lap over the problem was is is real celebrated it - right here and stopped but when they get in the Millennium they're gonna celebrate Jubilee because when they get into Jubilee hey there's 12 tribes are not going one of them Jews not gonna walk gonna say I got more cows than you got I got more horses and you got no there's going to be happy to be there so that's why and you say well how can you prove that well you know what I wasn't smart enough to prove it the Bible smart enough to prove it because remember I mean get my paperwork out here remember let's turn to Leviticus 25 19 brothers if y'all pull up Leviticus 25 19 I'm sorry and be a little bit long but we're gonna get this out of the way and the land shall yield her fruit and you shall eat your fill and dwell therein and safety and if you shall say what shall we eat the seventh year comes remember you don't plant you just read for what's already coming growing right and you and if you shall say what shall eat the seventh year behold we shall not sow or gather in our increase God said then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth seal six year and it shall bring forth fruit for three years and you shall sow the eighth year which is what that year right there now if there's a 50th year inserted you go down to the next year you can't do that that means you would have to win roll it back down yeah then I will come and my blessing you own the six year and you shall bring forth fruit for three years sixth seventh and eighth now if you had one more year in there and before Bibles perfect you had to wait four years together another crop you can't do that listen to what this commentator said I read you know what sometimes you ought to be able to just read what people say cuz look and you shall so the eighth year in need of the old fruit until the ninth year until her fruit comes into the old store but you can't stick another year in there because watch since the 49th year was already a sabbatical year the land was required to be left fallow during it that's why God said three years six seven and eight because you had to plan on the eight you didn't plan on the seven you've gathered your harvest on the seventh you ate of the ou8 you didn't you didn't plant you planted on eight here well they took one more year to get your crop in or six months I'm not a whole year but it took longer since the 49th year was already a sabbatical year and the land was required to be left fallow during it but at the 50 years if the fiftieth year also had to be kept follow you know if somebody added an extra year besides this coming back to the first year no new crop would be available for two years and only the summer fruits would be available for the following year creating a much greater risk of starvation now they contend that the Jubilee year was identical with the 49th year so there's not you say what's the problem what's what's what you told my brother Brown said right here he said it's not an eighth day he said you'd go back to the first it's not a fiftieth year you go back to the first perfect perfect brother BAM knew what he was talking about of course obviously the Bible knows what he's telling no it's nobody's telling them but that's what you call it Jubilee cycle so 7 times 7 is 4 and 4 49 all right so now mm-hmm just real quick what that brother dales tell about the thirty four hundred and thirty years it be thirty-five hundred years if it was 50 70 times 50 he talked covered this morning if it was seventy times fifty years but it's 70 times 49 then your Jubilee a year see they never do clarity because they never blew the trumpet in October to say this is going to be a jubilee year they'd had to give everything back but it will blow the Feast of Trumpets will blow in the white going into the millennium and when it blows its going to blow and tell us tell them not us that you are now in your Jubilee year your land can rest you know what me and you're not gonna have to plant weren't even in the future home the brother Branson you won't be planting fruit but now they might be outside but you're not gonna be playing fruit we're listen it's a rest time time of rest for each one of us but that proves to me you're talking about what brother Brown was talking about they said he was wrong no he's actually right there's no 50th year it stood back to the first step it's the back to the first year so you had a Jubilee ever 49 years and when you come to that fiftieth year if they didn't blow the trumpet you just went right on with another seven-year cycle and that's what they've been doing 7 times 7 is 49 but when a prophet come and blow the trumpet he proclaimed that right there that all can go free body spirit and soul because a lot of even in the church ages sure they went free they had their Pentecost they had their time amen but when you come to now we're at the very end ours is not just a 49 we're heading toward the land the land being made free this thing right here being made free less than their feet this is what we're looking for we're pushing toward a body change we're not pushing toward a new new birth the new birth has never changed but the new birth is brother Dale said last Sunday the new birth according to Malachi 4 is not going to just change our inside it's gonna change our outside it's the 50 years of your land the Jubilee of your land to go free who the Sun has set free it's free and D god bless you hope that kind of helps you a little bit because there is no 50th year but there had to be on October the 10th of the previous year there had to be a priest declare the 50th year and what happened in the Old Testament they never declared it because you know what they did they walked over that priest and they went don't blow a trumpet I'll lose all my money in other words ain't giving you no money in other words hand here's you some here don't blow that trumpet don't you think that you'd do that sure he would if he's sitting there with all the million cattle and all this all this stuff you know I mean dad was over there one time the rest have been there four times Jews are different they're pretty staunch they're pretty you know we're right here and you're down well you're not even here you're down like underneath here you know the Gentiles we're just dogs but they just got to realize one thing them dogs are ordained to get out of here before God can come and visit them less thing a song let's give these youth the big hand that's a big youth near the cross what page 1 205 205 let's sing a song just for a minute let's just sing a couple of verses if you have a need a little bit long I'm sorry but I wanted to get that we can keep that in your mind [Music] ha fountain free to all the healing stream flows from singing to him let's raise our hands Oh be my glory my child - the girls are watching way o be singing i reused a golden strand trust me [Music] you doing [Music] my why so shy [Music] think about this when Jesus was on earth like I said he was there during all those feast he would go to the temple but you remember what happened they were at the feast of Pentecost when Jesus got lost read your Bible Joseph and Mary went to the feast of Pentecost they were leaving the feast of Pentecost and they lost Jesus and brother Branham said that's where all the denominations left Jesus was that today of Pentecost they lost him they forgot him they couldn't find him but I was just thinking now as we were singing that song you know Jesus was there during the feast of Pentecost during his life but remember no one no one celebrated that feast of Pentecost while Jesus was there the way that they were supposed to celebrate him the feast of Pentecost happened fifty days after he died and then the true Pentecost the true fifty day was on that day when he came back in the whole of the form of the Holy Ghost and he went into 120 believers that was the true day of Pentecost they didn't lose him they found him that's what you and I we find him on that day of Pentecost which Penta is 50 so we find him not in the 49 we find him in a 50 hey man let's bow our heads the Heavenly Father thank you for this day thanks for the time that we've had to fellowship around your word sorry that we were a little bit in lengthy Lord but we wanted to get the thought so the people can think on it as brother Dale brings it so wonderful mm-hmm as we continue on through this maybe they'll have a little point in their mind that'll help them do the journey father just be with us forgive us of our sins bless the ones that are sick Lord they're not with us today ones they're on the highways be a brother Bob on his way back Lord from ministering your word just bless him and be with him and take care of him be with each one now as they're on their way home as the wheels turn Lord may they be singing Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me I once was lost but now I'm fine I once was the lost in that 49 but now Lord you brought us into a Jubilee a time of release where everything goes free and you promised it Lord that we'll have that in the end time we will be released from this bondage that we're in I thank you for that Lord thank you for your word let's brother Russ as he continues on his work day tomorrow Lord visiting in Atlanta and then it's flight on back home Lord just take care of him and be with his family and bless them people brother Dale keep him safe touch his back thank you for being my brother jewel lord I pray that you just bring that man out of that we need him Lord we need somebody like that on the field that's solid that's a true evangelist for your word Lord so just raise them up for your honor and glory Lord will give you the praise and honor and glory for all things in Jesus name we pray amen you're dismissed er [Music] the my [Music]
