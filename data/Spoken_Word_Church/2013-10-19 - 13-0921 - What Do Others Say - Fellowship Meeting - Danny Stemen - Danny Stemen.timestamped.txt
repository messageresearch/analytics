[1:08:02] to
[1:08:04] something and we waited and then there
[1:08:06] big long line for a while there too but
[1:08:08] again there was another bad accident so
[1:08:09] I hope nothing real bad but I'm grateful
[1:08:12] to the Lord to be here and I want to be
[1:08:14] here I come cuz I want to be here amen
[1:08:17] amen and today I celebrate the 24th
[1:08:20] birthday of my first son who passed away
[1:08:22] into Glory all right and at the same
[1:08:25] same time today I celebrate this is the
[1:08:27] last pill my daughter will be taking is
[1:08:31] today started
[1:08:39] with she come out of the hospital taking
[1:08:41] 21 pills and we just slowly weaned it
[1:08:44] off as the Lord would permit and as the
[1:08:46] doctors would counsel most of the time
[1:08:48] but recently one of the doctors said
[1:08:50] well this one and this one it's off the
[1:08:51] table you can't get off of that one and
[1:08:54] then uh but uh this this is the last day
[1:08:56] so we're very very grateful I remember
[1:08:59] walking in the door and I wanted to see
[1:09:01] one person I wanted to see Hunter Loria
[1:09:04] and I couldn't find him and I looked
[1:09:05] down the road I saw all these big
[1:09:06] handsome guys and where's Hunter because
[1:09:08] I remember getting a call not that long
[1:09:10] ago I wanted you don't know how blessed
[1:09:12] we are I got this call and and he had
[1:09:15] gotten in this accident and my heart
[1:09:16] just went right down in the ground and
[1:09:17] started dragging around like it felt
[1:09:20] like my own son had gotten in an
[1:09:22] accident and then I heard the great
[1:09:23] report and so I I'm real glad
[1:09:30] amen so God is God's on the move and
[1:09:34] he's uh he's very carefully shaping and
[1:09:37] molding us into an image using all these
[1:09:40] events in our lives Hunter will never be
[1:09:42] the same my daughter will never be I
[1:09:44] certainly will never be the same and uh
[1:09:47] all of us here are going through one
[1:09:49] thing after another if you're called to
[1:09:50] be bride amen and I've come to the
[1:09:53] conclusion there's a lot of Christians
[1:09:55] and not all are called to be bride
[1:09:57] there's a lot of lovely sisters here
[1:09:59] today I just look at all my friends but
[1:10:01] only one of them was my bride right amen
[1:10:04] and and that's how it is out in this
[1:10:05] world and how we ought to love them how
[1:10:08] blessed are you if you understand the
[1:10:10] revelation of this last hour all right
[1:10:12] it is simply God's grace revealing unto
[1:10:15] you yes his will for your life and you
[1:10:18] actually let him mold you and shape you
[1:10:21] into an image that he's pleased with and
[1:10:23] that is perfectly in line with his his
[1:10:25] word amen and uh we we went up to
[1:10:28] Wisconsin I had a brother who died a few
[1:10:31] weeks ago and uh we went and visit our
[1:10:34] Pentecostal Church where we come from
[1:10:36] and you know we just started listening
[1:10:37] to that old preaching and they said if
[1:10:39] you hadn't uh spoken in anyone who
[1:10:42] didn't speak with tongues has no power
[1:10:44] with God thought okay and they says if
[1:10:47] you don't go to church that believes in
[1:10:48] that you have no power with God then
[1:10:50] they said before Pentecost nobody had
[1:10:52] any power with God I'm thinking well how
[1:10:54] in the world could all that
[1:10:55] [Laughter]
[1:10:57] be and that was the closest thing to the
[1:11:00] truth that I knew of outside of this
[1:11:03] message what this message is it's a
[1:11:06] revelation of the Life of Christ inside
[1:11:08] of a human being amen and it's for us
[1:11:11] and it's uh you know people say well
[1:11:14] we're preaching Jesus we're and I think
[1:11:16] they ought to keep doing it because
[1:11:18] without salvation you're not even in the
[1:11:20] ring but the bride she's going up in her
[1:11:24] Rapture right it's not another message
[1:11:26] or another gospel but the question of
[1:11:28] Salvation has been settled for the bride
[1:11:31] she knows she's saved because we heard
[1:11:33] the voice of John the Revelator scream
[1:11:35] out in heaven CU he saw the lamb take
[1:11:38] the book and we know we're Sav but
[1:11:40] there's another event that must happen
[1:11:42] right people say well we don't need the
[1:11:44] message you do need the message well we
[1:11:47] got Jesus and we're saved that's true
[1:11:49] you're saved but do you want to be in
[1:11:50] the Rapture you want to be left
[1:11:52] behind I don't want to have to die for
[1:11:54] my faith because I I didn't catch the
[1:11:55] Ark in the days of
[1:11:57] Noah or I would have been putting that
[1:12:00] blood over the doorpost in the days of
[1:12:01] Moses why CU I'm predestinated to that
[1:12:03] revelation of my hour and in this hour
[1:12:07] there's another Ark being built and it's
[1:12:08] a word Arc and when God sees that word
[1:12:12] inside of a human being he takes it off
[1:12:14] this earth when he comes back down and
[1:12:16] those that are dead will be quickened
[1:12:18] first and then us that's the difference
[1:12:21] well you mean we need more than G it is
[1:12:24] Jesus it's Jesus in spoken word form
[1:12:27] speaking to a people calling them
[1:12:29] actually identifying you it's become the
[1:12:32] Inconvenient Truth because many a heart
[1:12:34] and many a soul hears and says you know
[1:12:37] it is kind of true I believe I'll go ask
[1:12:39] my pastor if I have to do it and they'll
[1:12:41] say no you
[1:12:42] don't it's not up to your pastor or my
[1:12:45] pastor it's up to God Almighty you hear
[1:12:47] it you'll be accountable for it he'll
[1:12:49] say but what did you do when Noah opened
[1:12:51] the door of the Ark and asked you to
[1:12:53] come in this word
[1:12:55] if this word ever gets inside of you
[1:12:58] like it got inside of Paul the Apostle
[1:13:00] in his day and William brandom in his
[1:13:02] day and us in our day if that word is in
[1:13:05] you you cannot be
[1:13:07] lost you cannot the Rapture cannot even
[1:13:11] happen without you being in
[1:13:13] it I was a hold up on this thing for 29
[1:13:16] years but not
[1:13:18] anymore and I want to say the trials
[1:13:20] that I've been through have shaped me
[1:13:22] and molded me and I'm understanding them
[1:13:24] now
[1:13:25] when there was less of Tom crocheting it
[1:13:27] seemed like Jesus was much more welcome
[1:13:29] in my life there's an enemy out there
[1:13:32] and the enemy is is the ease of the
[1:13:35] flesh whatever you want it's there the
[1:13:38] click of a little thing gets you
[1:13:40] whatever you want beware of that when
[1:13:43] everything looks so easy beware that you
[1:13:46] might be missing something crucial amen
[1:13:50] what is that crucial thing in this hour
[1:13:52] it's the word of God revealed amen that
[1:13:55] Bible's been around for hundreds of
[1:13:57] years people actually read the Bible and
[1:14:00] killed 68 million Christians they read
[1:14:03] the Bible another day and allowed the
[1:14:05] Jews to be persecuted you know a giant
[1:14:07] ship come with Jewish immigrants in our
[1:14:09] country said no you can't have them and
[1:14:11] they sent them back to Israel or excuse
[1:14:14] me to Europe and they all got killed in
[1:14:16] a a death chamber they all had the
[1:14:18] Bibles to read but then God comes down
[1:14:21] and he Reveals His intent for the hour
[1:14:24] it Chang us amen that's why it's not
[1:14:28] Theory it's
[1:14:29] conviction people say well how do you
[1:14:31] memorize all this stuff I'm not
[1:14:33] memorizing anything this what I feel
[1:14:35] it's what I actually
[1:14:37] feel well society's changed it has
[1:14:41] changed it's going to change so much one
[1:14:43] day we're going to walk right out of
[1:14:44] here so blessed are you if you're even
[1:14:48] saved bless you because if you're saved
[1:14:50] you will make it through the
[1:14:52] tribulation you will suffer though
[1:14:55] but blessed 10 times over are you if
[1:14:59] you've heard the word of this hour and
[1:15:01] have heard it and I've seen it I've I've
[1:15:05] been blessed brother Brown said he said
[1:15:08] if this be the truth of Almighty God's
[1:15:10] word he said then God will let me know
[1:15:13] what's wrong with you or you and he'd
[1:15:15] say oh he says now you can't even hide
[1:15:18] your thoughts he said to let you know
[1:15:20] that I'm God's prophet and I come to you
[1:15:22] with the word of the Lord Brother so so

[1:15:30] years ago about such and he began to
[1:15:32] discern it perfectly he says that is so
[1:15:36] you will know that what I preach to you
[1:15:39] is the truth from the Bible he said he
[1:15:42] even prayed he says God don't bless it
[1:15:45] if it's not from you and it
[1:15:49] was so I'm thrilled to be just one

[1:29:42] well I just want to say what a privilege
[1:29:44] it is to be here again at uh with
[1:29:47] brother Homer and at the fellowship
[1:29:49] meeting we've always appreciated uh
[1:29:52] coming and being a part of it
[1:29:54] and we we we're even farther south than
[1:29:56] you are so you think you're Southern
[1:29:58] we're even more Southern I guess I don't
[1:30:01] know how that works but I just want to
[1:30:03] take the time to appreciate each one of
[1:30:06] you each one of the ministers that we've
[1:30:07] heard speak and I I I come
[1:30:11] from a different generation than most of
[1:30:14] you the ones that have spoke is that
[1:30:16] okay to say that you don't feel bad well
[1:30:19] you was talking about how old you was
[1:30:21] anyway most of them so but uh I I want
[1:30:25] to I want to appreciate you and and
[1:30:27] thank you for the life that you've lived
[1:30:30] and uh it's not how great we are how
[1:30:34] great we can
[1:30:35] speak what great things we've done it's
[1:30:38] he that endureth to the end the Bible
[1:30:40] says they shall be saved and you know
[1:30:43] there's some that run for a while and
[1:30:45] and and they have some great Ministries
[1:30:47] or whatever uh all over the map you know
[1:30:51] and but I appreciate men like you that
[1:30:53] that just lived an example for for men
[1:30:56] like me that I can come up with these
[1:30:58] examples of in front of me to realize
[1:31:01] sometimes a young Minister can think
[1:31:03] that it's all about him but the longer
[1:31:06] you live you realize it's all about him
[1:31:09] it's not about you can you say Amen it's
[1:31:11] about him and and about how we surrender
[1:31:13] oursel and get oursel out of the way
[1:31:15] just hearing brother Bram say that the
[1:31:18] gift uh is not so much exercising it
[1:31:22] it's how you get yourself out of of the
[1:31:24] way you have to get yourself out of the
[1:31:26] way in order for God to move and and
[1:31:28] that's that that can take a lifetime of
[1:31:30] realizing that but I just want to say
[1:31:33] God bless you and bring greetings from
[1:31:34] our assembly back home in Sarasota
[1:31:36] Florida I want to appreciate me brother
[1:31:39] JT God bless you again it's good to see
[1:31:42] you brother Dale God bless you and these
[1:31:45] these brothers I I remember all of them
[1:31:47] when I was young and uh I'm not I can't
[1:31:50] really say that much anymore huh when
[1:31:53] you
[1:31:55] here forget anyway in just a moment so I
[1:31:58] you know I but I do remember you
[1:32:01] know and then to meet others along the
[1:32:04] way like brother Tom and and um and
[1:32:06] trying to see some of the other younger
[1:32:07] ministers in here I was going to say
[1:32:09] Brother David but he's not that young
[1:32:11] and but it just it's just been a
[1:32:13] blessing and I just appreciate each one
[1:32:15] of you may God bless you amen we I do
[1:32:19] understand also that uh that food uh
[1:32:21] eating starts a half hour after ice
[1:32:23] started so I don't have much time left
[1:32:26] to say much so we just want to go right
[1:32:27] to the word you ministers know how it is
[1:32:30] that when you when you uh uh study and
[1:32:34] try to find the mind of the Lord on what
[1:32:37] to say and then he can change it amen
[1:32:41] just real quick God is good at keeping
[1:32:43] us
[1:32:44] uncomfortable and
[1:32:46] nervous you know that's part of the
[1:32:48] humility process but I I I I appreciate
[1:32:52] the way he works with us and deals with
[1:32:54] us so if this seems a little strange to
[1:32:56] you uh today you just uh just put it up
[1:33:00] to the Lord amen this is what he laid on
[1:33:02] our heart this morning you know I'm I'm
[1:33:04] kind of the the type that likes to have
[1:33:06] it lined out a week or two in advance
[1:33:09] but then sometimes it just don't work
[1:33:11] that way but God bless you certain and
[1:33:14] appreciate you brother Homer has been a
[1:33:16] special friend to me and I appreciate
[1:33:18] him he's been there as somebody that uh
[1:33:21] I truly have confidence in amen and and
[1:33:23] I I appreciate his his uh Ministry and
[1:33:27] and the ministry that ised me uh as a
[1:33:31] young Minister and in my ups and downs
[1:33:32] and my mistakes he's always been a
[1:33:34] friend and I appreciate that because I
[1:33:36] make mistakes I I might be the only one
[1:33:38] in here but I do make mistakes and and
[1:33:41] uh and I I I just appreciate brother
[1:33:44] Homer and our church we send greetings
[1:33:46] from each one of them they wanted to be
[1:33:48] sure and tell brother Homer hello and
[1:33:50] some of the things they told me to tell
[1:33:51] him I can't do because he likes his hair
[1:33:53] too much they told me to ruffle his hair
[1:33:55] and everything else but you all
[1:33:57] understand that being from here so amen
[1:33:59] do you love him amen I I just want to I
[1:34:02] want to uh just quote a couple
[1:34:04] scriptures to you you can stand if you
[1:34:06] will I'm just going to read one verse
[1:34:09] out of Matthew 13 and6 and then I'm
[1:34:11] going to let you be seated and read a
[1:34:13] few more verses out of Matthew 16
[1:34:16] Matthew 13 and 16 says but blessed are
[1:34:20] your eyes for they see and your ears for
[1:34:24] they hear you can be seated may the Lord
[1:34:27] bless you in his word I'm sorry that you
[1:34:28] just found it by the time you got seated
[1:34:30] but amen we do understand food's Des do
[1:34:33] I have to use this
[1:34:35] one all right we're on the third one
[1:34:38] first poll second pole third pole amen
[1:34:43] we're there it's blue amen all right so
[1:34:48] Matthew 16 and13
[1:34:50] says when Jesus came into the coast of
[1:34:53] of cesaria Philippi he asked his
[1:34:55] disciples
[1:34:56] saying whom do men say that I the son of
[1:34:59] man am and they said some say that thou
[1:35:03] art John the Baptist some Elias others
[1:35:07] Jeremiah or one of the prophets and he
[1:35:09] saith unto them but whom say ye that I
[1:35:11] am Simon Peter answered and said Thou
[1:35:14] Art the Christ the son of the Living God
[1:35:17] and Jesus answered and said unto him
[1:35:19] blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah for
[1:35:22] Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it to
[1:35:24] thee but my Father which is in heaven
[1:35:28] amen amen I I was just listening to all
[1:35:31] the things all the comments that have
[1:35:32] been said by the ministers and you know
[1:35:34] brother Dale is talking about election
[1:35:37] predestination I don't believe that that
[1:35:39] is a a a a revelation that you can say
[1:35:42] well this is cut and dried it's
[1:35:45] something that that God is continually
[1:35:48] revealing to us can you say amen and and
[1:35:51] and we just want to appreciate that this
[1:35:53] morning and I or this whatever it is uh
[1:35:56] I want to I I want to title this out of
[1:35:59] this thought what do others
[1:36:03] say what do others say now as as I
[1:36:08] already said a a young Minister can make
[1:36:10] the mistake of of thinking it's about
[1:36:13] him and begin to think that you know I
[1:36:17] I'm somebody that that carries a message
[1:36:19] that that ought to be listened to and
[1:36:21] and people ought to listen to me and in
[1:36:23] fact you see that rising up in the
[1:36:25] ministry today not so much the message
[1:36:27] but but around the Earth where there is
[1:36:31] a a refusal to acknowledge the authority
[1:36:35] of the
[1:36:36] word and really because it's a sin
[1:36:38] question can you say Amen because if you
[1:36:41] acknowledge the word you have to
[1:36:43] acknowledge the
[1:36:44] sin cuz in order to get right you have
[1:36:47] to repent you cannot get right without
[1:36:50] repenting right I read the other day day
[1:36:53] where I don't think you're mind if I
[1:36:55] mention the name but Joel Olstein was
[1:36:57] rebuking Paul and Peter and John for the
[1:37:00] things they
[1:37:01] said and I thought well you know that's
[1:37:03] going to go over good at the white
[1:37:06] Throne judgment that you know you
[1:37:08] thought because you had 30,000 in your
[1:37:10] congregation that you could change what
[1:37:12] the word
[1:37:14] says but this is the hour of unbelief
[1:37:17] that we live in this is the hour that
[1:37:19] you have to confront and and God wants
[1:37:21] us to confront it he don't want us to
[1:37:24] avoid the questions he don't want us to
[1:37:26] avoid the doubts he don't want us to
[1:37:28] avoid the rumors but he wants you to
[1:37:30] deal with it so that you know where you
[1:37:33] stand and who you believe that you can
[1:37:35] say as Paul said that I am
[1:37:39] persuaded amen so uh and then of course
[1:37:44] the leader of of the religious world the
[1:37:46] pope just made his recent comments on
[1:37:49] homosexuality and so forth and how that
[1:37:52] you know we ought not to be fixated on
[1:37:54] those things that we become
[1:37:56] narrow-minded but we ought to be
[1:37:57] broad-minded and so forth so you see
[1:37:59] everything amen is coming
[1:38:04] together it's already been spoken
[1:38:07] of amen and we are the recipients of
[1:38:09] that now I I I just tell you it's very
[1:38:13] easy to get the wrong report of
[1:38:16] something so when we're talking about
[1:38:18] Jesus walking down the road speaking
[1:38:21] with his disciples he was saying whom do
[1:38:24] men say that I am he didn't say who does
[1:38:27] God say that I am he said who do men say
[1:38:30] that I
[1:38:31] am because it's really easy to get the
[1:38:34] wrong
[1:38:35] report you know I'd heard I'd heard that
[1:38:38] brother Homer uh uh was really sick I
[1:38:41] had went on a trip and I come back and
[1:38:43] I'd heard he was really sick and then my
[1:38:45] my son was working and he come rushing
[1:38:47] him from his job and he said dad did you
[1:38:50] hear that brother Homer was in a real
[1:38:51] bad accident he's in the hospital
[1:38:54] so now Not only was brother Homer really
[1:38:56] sick he was in a in a real bad
[1:38:59] accident okay now now I know is brother
[1:39:02] Hunter we thank the Lord for for his
[1:39:04] Deliverance amen and and uh
[1:39:08] so if I had to just listened to that
[1:39:11] Source I'd have had the wrong
[1:39:14] message see it depended on what source I
[1:39:17] was getting the message from on the
[1:39:20] effect it was going to have on so what I
[1:39:22] had to do I had to call Brother Homer
[1:39:24] and ask him what yeah exactly are you
[1:39:27] almost dead so anyway we got the right
[1:39:30] story so why did Jesus want amen the
[1:39:34] disciples to confront this
[1:39:38] question why did he asked him what do
[1:39:40] men say so they said well one says
[1:39:43] you're this one one says you're that
[1:39:46] Prophet one says you're uh Jeremiah then
[1:39:50] he goes but okay now that's the rumors
[1:39:53] yeah that's what everybody else
[1:39:56] says my cousin asked me one day and I'm
[1:39:58] just speaking like this because if I get
[1:40:00] too wound up we're going to miss dinner
[1:40:02] amen my cousin asked me one day he said
[1:40:05] he said uh uh Danny are you still
[1:40:08] preaching with that William Brandon
[1:40:09] preaches and I I just be before I get
[1:40:11] into that I'll say I do it without
[1:40:14] apology amen and and so and I trust some
[1:40:17] of you would understand later but amen
[1:40:19] I'm speaking to the choir here I
[1:40:21] understand that but anyway he goes you
[1:40:22] still preaching with what that Brandon
[1:40:23] preaches and I said yes I am and I said
[1:40:26] why do you ask cuz I was curious why do
[1:40:29] you ask and he he says and this is his
[1:40:32] answer he goes because he's gone
[1:40:35] to to
[1:40:37] hell that was his
[1:40:40] answer I said you know Jimmy I wouldn't
[1:40:43] have said
[1:40:45] anything until you said that I want to
[1:40:48] ask you a
[1:40:50] question I said how much do you know
[1:40:52] about him
[1:40:56] he said well I said have you read any of
[1:40:58] his sermons listened to any of them he
[1:41:01] says well my dad read one book and said
[1:41:04] it was no
[1:41:06] good I said so now you're saying that
[1:41:10] your dad's real sick and in the hospital
[1:41:12] because he had a bad
[1:41:13] wreck did you get
[1:41:16] it I saidou saying this is all wrong
[1:41:19] because your dad said it's no good
[1:41:23] I said' now Jimmy I wouldn't have said
[1:41:25] anything I said but I'm going to prove
[1:41:27] to you that you don't even believe your
[1:41:31] Bible I said you don't even believe your
[1:41:34] Bible you only take what your Bishop
[1:41:36] tells
[1:41:37] you see because it was the it was the
[1:41:39] Corral I had come out of it was the
[1:41:41] prison house I'd been loose from so I
[1:41:43] knew what they believe there's nothing
[1:41:44] but trinitarian Pagan idolators cuz
[1:41:46] that's what you
[1:41:47] are so I said do you understand that
[1:41:50] your Bible says that the worlds were
[1:41:53] created by Jesus Christ cuz you know a
[1:41:55] trinitarian got a fundamental
[1:41:59] problem
[1:42:01] amen and he goes it don't say that I
[1:42:03] said see you don't even believe your own
[1:42:09] Bible so then he just got mad but that's
[1:42:13] not good enough you got to know and so
[1:42:17] this is what Jesus asked his disciples
[1:42:19] amen whom do men say that I am brother
[1:42:22] Tony I just skipped right over you I'm
[1:42:23] sorry God bless you this is a place of
[1:42:25] Fellowship so I got to acknowledge
[1:42:26] brother Tony amen you sat too close to
[1:42:29] the front amen so he said whom do men
[1:42:32] say that I
[1:42:34] am so some said you're this Prophet some
[1:42:38] say you're that
[1:42:39] Prophet see because he's associating his
[1:42:42] ministry with the
[1:42:43] prophets he said but who do you say that
[1:42:46] I am I want to know what you know about
[1:42:50] it amen he said you're the
[1:42:56] Christ the son of the Living
[1:42:59] God and Jesus said blessed art thou
[1:43:03] Simon bar Jonah there's no Seminary has
[1:43:07] taught this to you no preacher come
[1:43:09] along and give you his private
[1:43:10] Revelation to show you who I am but it
[1:43:13] was my Father which is in
[1:43:17] heaven amen because this is not Seminary
[1:43:20] taught it's by revelation we must
[1:43:22] receive it it I'll just say this is is
[1:43:25] what the prophet said that today we
[1:43:28] stand here by the grace of God with a
[1:43:31] perfect interpretation of the word with
[1:43:34] Divine
[1:43:37] Vindication because the whole program of
[1:43:39] God is divine revelation can you say
[1:43:42] amen I know I mean this may be just milk
[1:43:45] to you but I want to say it still must
[1:43:47] be divine
[1:43:48] revelation we've got to a place where
[1:43:50] it's we're just teaching people into to
[1:43:53] something without them having a real
[1:43:55] birth without them meeting God they
[1:43:58] don't know him anymore and the Book of
[1:44:00] Judges said that when the old men of God
[1:44:03] had died off and that's what's happening
[1:44:05] Joshua died off and all those that had
[1:44:07] seen the works of God There Rose up a
[1:44:10] generation that didn't know
[1:44:12] him so now I'm talking to a generation
[1:44:15] amen that there a second generation or
[1:44:17] they're a third generation and they only
[1:44:19] have heard about what God has done so
[1:44:22] it's got to be more more than just a
[1:44:23] Doctrine they must meet him in the power
[1:44:26] of his resurrection because you must
[1:44:28] know him by divine
[1:44:31] revelation is that all
[1:44:33] right has to be that
[1:44:36] way amen it has to be that
[1:44:39] way Amen brother bam said in this day
[1:44:43] who will have the power of
[1:44:48] infallibility hey that's some
[1:44:51] word do you know what infal ability
[1:44:53] means incapable of making an
[1:44:57] error now don't make a
[1:45:01] mistake because you're thinking of human
[1:45:03] error or human failure but this is not
[1:45:06] what he's talking about he's talking
[1:45:09] about a word that is perfect he said who
[1:45:13] will have the power of infallibility
[1:45:16] which is to be restored in the last age
[1:45:18] the last age going back to manifesting
[1:45:21] the pure word bride
[1:45:24] right I believe in Simplicity I don't
[1:45:26] believe we should confuse it up so much
[1:45:28] that we come in and listen and go out
[1:45:30] and so confused we don't have a clue
[1:45:31] what the preacher is talking about when
[1:45:33] he's talking about a pure word bride
[1:45:34] he's talking about a bride standing on
[1:45:35] the pure word can you say Amen that
[1:45:39] means we have the word again as it was
[1:45:41] perfectly given and perfectly understood
[1:45:43] in the days of Paul that's the promise
[1:45:45] for this hour the hour of restoration
[1:45:47] now when Jesus came it was the hour of
[1:45:50] the sacrifice
[1:45:53] that's right come on now that's it and
[1:45:54] he was asking them you were talking
[1:45:56] about Noah's day you were talking about
[1:45:58] Moses day and he was asking them what
[1:46:01] are you talking now what are they saying
[1:46:03] about my
[1:46:05] day well we understand that they talk
[1:46:08] about
[1:46:09] Moses it's so easy to talk about a past
[1:46:12] message but what is he doing today
[1:46:15] that's right his message is
[1:46:18] perfect and he always sends it in such a
[1:46:21] way that the people have a heart hard
[1:46:23] time with
[1:46:24] it they have a hard time of believing it
[1:46:27] because of how unusual it
[1:46:32] is amen now when I say unusual I don't
[1:46:35] mean
[1:46:37] immoral I don't mean of a man propping
[1:46:40] himself up and making himself uh God's
[1:46:43] Prophet while he goes out and gathers
[1:46:45] great money and
[1:46:47] rewards and great
[1:46:48] [Applause]
[1:46:50] popularity it's not what I'm talking
[1:46:52] about
[1:46:54] but it's always a message from God is
[1:46:57] always unusual and it's and this is a
[1:47:00] strange word but it's the very
[1:47:01] unusualness of it that stumbles the
[1:47:06] people and they miss it because the
[1:47:09] spirit of Revelation is not
[1:47:13] there just say how perfect this message
[1:47:15] dovet tales with the
[1:47:20] scripture remember this mess message did
[1:47:23] not come to do away with the Bible his
[1:47:25] message did not come to give a different
[1:47:27] interpretation of it I did not stop
[1:47:29] reading my Bible once I received the
[1:47:32] message amen I did not only study the
[1:47:35] message because the message came you
[1:47:37] know I've heard some ridiculous comments
[1:47:38] made brother Homer and you can throw me
[1:47:40] off anytime you want but I've heard
[1:47:41] ridiculous comments made would you
[1:47:43] rather have the Bible or the message
[1:47:44] which one would you rather
[1:47:46] have why do we even get into that sort
[1:47:48] of discussion amen but rather amen I the
[1:47:52] the message is the revealed word that
[1:47:54] reveals the written word that's what it
[1:47:57] is the message explains what the Bible
[1:48:00] means as simple as that without the
[1:48:04] message you would only have
[1:48:05] denominational perspective of the Bible
[1:48:08] you would only be trying to study the
[1:48:10] Bible to learn some good principles of
[1:48:12] how to live right amen with no real
[1:48:14] focus of God Amen as as brother Samuel
[1:48:18] is talking about the predetermination of
[1:48:20] God to bring forth a group of people
[1:48:23] that means in every age he raised the
[1:48:25] people up for a specific purpose that
[1:48:27] they were brought there to do something
[1:48:30] that in their age they would be called
[1:48:32] living
[1:48:33] Epistles they would actually be
[1:48:35] revealing what the written word was by
[1:48:38] the life that they
[1:48:40] lived do we believe that is that a
[1:48:42] little
[1:48:45] anemic that true it has to be a lived
[1:48:49] life have to be a lived voice amen
[1:48:54] and that people would actually be the
[1:48:59] Revelation brother bam said what balam
[1:49:02] failed to see when he looked down and
[1:49:04] tried to curse Israel was he failed to
[1:49:06] see that the shadow of the King was in
[1:49:08] the camp he failed to see the Brazen
[1:49:11] serpent he failed to see the prophet
[1:49:13] that was there and he only saw a human
[1:49:20] failure surely God would have to curse
[1:49:22] that look this man over here he did this
[1:49:24] surely God have look at this family over
[1:49:26] here they're going and living anyway
[1:49:27] they're doing bad business deals and
[1:49:29] whatever more surely God will have to
[1:49:30] curse that I don't care what move of God
[1:49:33] you have there's always going to be
[1:49:34] human failure amen that's right but what
[1:49:38] balam failed to see God told him God
[1:49:41] told him he said don't go down there for
[1:49:44] I have blessed those people they're
[1:49:46] carrying the blessing thank you Lord
[1:49:48] Jesus I don't care what you do I'm not
[1:49:50] going to curse them come on Hallelujah
[1:49:53] that's right that's what he said read
[1:49:54] your Bible but see because balam loved
[1:49:58] money did he heard he had a greater
[1:50:01] offer so he went back and he and he told
[1:50:04] God can I go you
[1:50:06] know and God says go but you're only
[1:50:09] going to say what I tell you to say now
[1:50:12] balum if youve ever understood he's the
[1:50:13] first recorded uh record we have in the
[1:50:16] Bible of the First Act of road rage did
[1:50:18] you know
[1:50:20] that it's ABS absolutely abolutely right
[1:50:23] First Act of rotor and it wasn't with
[1:50:24] another driver is with his with his
[1:50:27] vehicle his vehicle you know this is a
[1:50:29] crazy thing you see and so but when he
[1:50:32] tried to get up there to curse Israel
[1:50:35] from all these different points he
[1:50:37] couldn't do
[1:50:38] it God would not allow him and he failed
[1:50:41] to see what was actually there right and
[1:50:44] it's always been that way in every age
[1:50:47] men fail to see what's actually here
[1:50:53] on slow down for the next seven
[1:50:57] minutes now here we come to Jesus and
[1:51:00] they're failing to see the same
[1:51:02] thing well they've heard that there's
[1:51:05] there's a man in the area that's got
[1:51:07] this the signs and wonders are following
[1:51:09] him but there's a lot of reports coming
[1:51:11] out that's really
[1:51:13] strange how we going to understand
[1:51:16] hundreds even thousands flocking to see
[1:51:18] him because of The Healing Ministry that
[1:51:20] accompanies him Supernatural is always
[1:51:23] attractive but we've heard many things
[1:51:25] about him that we're not sure
[1:51:27] of we've heard that his own Hometown
[1:51:29] won't have nothing to do with
[1:51:31] him we've heard reports that he's a
[1:51:33] Samaritan and we've heard reports that
[1:51:35] he was bored of illegitimate birth we've
[1:51:37] heard a lot of strange things about him
[1:51:38] and on top of that he comes out of
[1:51:40] Galilee and search the scripture No
[1:51:41] Prophet Rises out of Galilee now I'm one
[1:51:43] the reason I'm saying that brother and
[1:51:45] sister I want to tell you how blessed
[1:51:46] you are to even be in a position to hear
[1:51:48] it
[1:51:49] correctly right amen you understand how
[1:51:53] little they actually knew about Jesus
[1:51:55] but they're thinking of him was shaped
[1:51:57] by somebody else's opinion that's how
[1:52:00] powerful you are that you can give an
[1:52:02] opinion it'll shape somebody else's idea
[1:52:04] about
[1:52:09] it there's fear to even believe in that
[1:52:12] man because of the repercussions it's
[1:52:14] going to have in our life our churches
[1:52:16] have warned us against
[1:52:19] him said if you actually believe what he
[1:52:22] said you're out of here you're no longer
[1:52:24] part of the synagogue you say well
[1:52:25] where's that brother Danny John N read
[1:52:27] your
[1:52:28] Bible it's there then on top of that we
[1:52:31] hear there's a lot of his own Believers
[1:52:33] that are leaving
[1:52:35] him that he says strange things that
[1:52:38] they don't understand so they said you
[1:52:39] know after a while they finally figure
[1:52:41] out this man's a false prophet so they
[1:52:43] turn and leave
[1:52:46] him am man 70 of them turned and walked
[1:52:49] away they said it's a hard saying who
[1:52:51] can hear it
[1:52:55] ask yourself this
[1:52:56] question would you have stayed with
[1:52:59] Jesus when those questions are flooding
[1:53:02] out about him when they're making their
[1:53:05] own believe the sign websites back there
[1:53:08] amen are you going to believe in the in
[1:53:10] the in the manifested work of God in
[1:53:13] that hour because you have to identify
[1:53:15] yourself where you stand but how you are
[1:53:19] now and when Jesus said except you e My
[1:53:22] Flesh and drink my blood you have no
[1:53:25] part with me and he never even gave them
[1:53:28] the kindness of explaining that to
[1:53:33] them Jesus must have been on a time
[1:53:36] constraint too they had dinner coming up
[1:53:39] as well so he just said eat my flesh
[1:53:41] drink my blood you have no life in me
[1:53:42] okay let's go on to the next
[1:53:44] Point yeah and those disciples said
[1:53:48] you're not going to explain that to us
[1:53:50] give us show us the proof what do you
[1:53:52] mean
[1:53:55] Jesus didn't have to because Jesus knew
[1:53:58] that if he could persuade them in they
[1:54:01] could be persuaded
[1:54:04] out that no soul will ever be won by
[1:54:10] argument but it's the power of the seed
[1:54:14] what you have inside of you on Jesus
[1:54:17] turned after his church had got really
[1:54:20] small he turned and looked at them and
[1:54:21] said are you going to go as well and
[1:54:24] Peter said Lord where are we going to go
[1:54:26] you alone have the words of eternal life
[1:54:28] there is nowhere else to go I can't go
[1:54:30] back to the Baptist I can't go back to
[1:54:32] the Pentecostal I can't go back to some
[1:54:34] camp this is the only thing that gives
[1:54:36] me
[1:54:39] life you should have a response on that
[1:54:41] for your own self this is the only thing
[1:54:44] where life comes from this is the only
[1:54:46] source of life
[1:54:54] so all of these things that are
[1:54:56] happening in his
[1:54:58] ministry
[1:55:00] Miracles the
[1:55:02] voices some say as an angel speaks to
[1:55:05] him voices Out of Heaven speak to him
[1:55:08] it's all strange a
[1:55:11] cultish
[1:55:13] on I had a had a 14 or 15y old girl out
[1:55:16] of my own church said oh I studied the
[1:55:18] message and it's and it's it's has all
[1:55:21] the ear marks of Ault and I
[1:55:23] laughed I said you studied the
[1:55:26] message I tell you what you studied you
[1:55:29] studied what kind of pants you wanted to
[1:55:31] wear you st you study what kind of
[1:55:34] makeup you wanted to put on you did not
[1:55:36] study the
[1:55:40] message come on church it's a love for
[1:55:43] the
[1:55:44] world not for the things of God so who
[1:55:47] are you going to serve
[1:55:52] then of course all the Learned people of
[1:55:54] that hour the Learned people they said
[1:55:57] now listen you're going to have blame
[1:55:58] this on God cuz I was not preaching this
[1:56:00] so that's right he just told me this
[1:56:02] morning in prayer brought this on my
[1:56:04] heart so it's your
[1:56:06] fault so then the scribes of that hour
[1:56:08] the Learned ones the theologians the
[1:56:10] studiers the scribes they should know
[1:56:12] who he
[1:56:14] is that's who I'm going to put my trust
[1:56:16] in they're the ones that are trained in
[1:56:19] the difficult things of Moses law to
[1:56:21] explain it to the people
[1:56:22] surely they recognized who he
[1:56:28] was amen and then look at the proof in
[1:56:31] the message itself there's even
[1:56:34] disagreements among the
[1:56:38] disciples so I want to ask
[1:56:41] you if you had been there and asked one
[1:56:43] of those people about Jesus what you'd
[1:56:47] heard about him would have depend where
[1:56:49] they saw him that's
[1:56:50] right right what if the person you asked
[1:56:53] was one of the scribes what if the
[1:56:56] person you asked was one of the
[1:56:58] 70
[1:57:02] right
[1:57:04] hallelujah what if the person you asked
[1:57:07] was one of those mocking him and
[1:57:09] laughing at him depends how you hear
[1:57:13] blessed are your eyes for they see the
[1:57:16] things of God blessed are your ears for
[1:57:20] they hear the things of God
[1:57:22] we are
[1:57:31] blessed amen so you have all of this and
[1:57:35] I we're taught that there is a man by
[1:57:38] the name of blind bmus I got one
[1:57:41] minute it's gonna be a good story
[1:57:44] there's a man by the name of blind
[1:57:47] Bas that he had been taught by his
[1:57:50] mother about about how God was and how
[1:57:54] he
[1:57:57] acted said he' been taught about all the
[1:58:01] supernatural things that took place in
[1:58:02] the wilderness
[1:58:03] journey and then you're familiar how he
[1:58:06] sat there on that rock and he's thinking
[1:58:08] oh if I could only have been
[1:58:11] there then he begins to think about
[1:58:14] Joshua and how he had met in that same
[1:58:17] city at the walls how he had met the
[1:58:19] captain of the Lord's host
[1:58:22] yes sir and he said if I could have only
[1:58:24] been there he could have given me my
[1:58:27] sight and he said little did he know
[1:58:29] that just a few hundred yards away the
[1:58:31] captain the host was coming his way and
[1:58:34] as he's sitting there in his
[1:58:36] blindness his natural blindness he's
[1:58:39] sitting there thinking about his
[1:58:41] condition he hears noises beginning to
[1:58:43] swell around him now he has a good
[1:58:45] foundation under him because he's been
[1:58:48] taught amen and he's listening to all
[1:58:51] the noises pretty soon hears shouting
[1:58:53] begin to come and mocking and hear
[1:58:55] somebody say oh we heard about this man
[1:58:57] named Lazarus that you raised him from
[1:58:58] the dead why don't you come over here we
[1:59:00] got a whole graveyard over here why
[1:59:01] don't you raise them yeah heard others
[1:59:05] mocking him and he somebody comes by him
[1:59:09] and he asks who is that what's going on
[1:59:11] and he said oh it's Jesus of Nazareth
[1:59:13] he's passing
[1:59:15] by and he'd heard about him now what if
[1:59:18] his idea of Jesus had been one of the
[1:59:20] critics what what if his idea of Jesus
[1:59:23] had been one of those throwing the
[1:59:24] tomatoes what if the idea of Jesus had
[1:59:26] been one of the disciples that had
[1:59:28] walked away and started their website
[1:59:30] what if his idea of Jesus would have
[1:59:32] been that but it wasn't his idea of
[1:59:35] Jesus was pure that he believed that
[1:59:38] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:59:40] forever can you say
[1:59:41] Amen see these these disciples that
[1:59:44] walked away from Jesus didn't have a
[1:59:46] pure
[1:59:46] heart if they was really right or true
[1:59:49] in their intent they said what Gia said
[1:59:54] that's right Gia said listen if this is
[1:59:57] of god you better not fight it let you
[2:00:00] fight against God and if it's not of God
[2:00:02] it'll just die out leave it
[2:00:05] alone but they don't take the
[2:00:08] advice amen so here's this man thinking
[2:00:11] on the Supernatural and the Supernatural
[2:00:13] is coming to him and when he hears amen
[2:00:17] the cries of the crowd he joined his
[2:00:20] voice with it yeah but where was his
[2:00:23] voice coming from
[2:00:25] Revelation and Revelation can only come
[2:00:28] to you by the Almighty I can't give it
[2:00:31] to you but he
[2:00:33] can and he screamed out thou son of
[2:00:36] David have mercy on
[2:00:41] meall you still have that same amen pull
[2:00:45] on God and here's the Lord Jesus
[2:00:47] enclosing walking amen toward Jerusalem
[2:00:50] the sins of the world on him the critics
[2:00:53] screaming at him the website set up to
[2:00:55] stop him and as he's walking up the up
[2:00:58] there he hears the cry maybe he was in
[2:01:00] Ohi Alabama he heard a
[2:01:03] cry and he
[2:01:06] stopped and he turned with all the sins
[2:01:09] of the world piled up upon him he
[2:01:12] stopped why it was the predestinated son
[2:01:17] of God stopping for a predestinated
[2:01:20] voice that would come come out in that
[2:01:22] [Applause]
[2:01:25] hour you understand your voice is
[2:01:27] predestinated to sound
[2:01:29] out call on that great gift of God thou
[2:01:33] son of
[2:01:35] David said what will you have me
[2:01:38] do he didn't say listen I'm too busy I'm
[2:01:40] going up to Calvary I don't have time
[2:01:43] for you you're a beggar you're not a
[2:01:45] social standing I don't have time for
[2:01:47] you I've got more important things to
[2:01:49] argue about and talk about and think
[2:01:50] about I got great message I'm going to
[2:01:52] ride a donkey into Jerusalem here and
[2:01:54] they're going to be worshiping here in
[2:01:55] just a little bit no no he never said
[2:01:57] that he said what would you have me do
[2:01:58] for you think about it God himself
[2:02:01] asking him come on come on come
[2:02:04] on God saying what do you want from
[2:02:08] me you know what he said I I want to
[2:02:11] know if all these rumors are
[2:02:15] true it's not what he said that's your
[2:02:17] problem you're too
[2:02:19] intellectual if Moses walked up to that
[2:02:21] burning bush and asked why it was
[2:02:23] burning amen God would have turned and
[2:02:25] walked away from him but he did exactly
[2:02:27] what that voice said and that same voice
[2:02:30] and the Man Called Jesus said what would
[2:02:32] you have me do and he said I want my
[2:02:41] sight that's what the revealed word of
[2:02:43] the hour is for brother and sister it's
[2:02:45] not about
[2:02:47] argument it's about sight
[2:02:52] setting the captive
[2:02:55] free so what position are you hearing it
[2:02:59] from this
[2:03:00] morning let's stand together that's all
[2:03:03] over the place but that's okay
[2:03:06] brother you come and finish it
[2:03:09] off do you love him what position are
[2:03:13] you hearing it
[2:03:14] from even though you amen you're here
[2:03:17] sitting here we represent all kinds of
[2:03:18] messy churches what
[2:03:20] position what you hearing it
[2:03:23] from what kind of Jesus do we have come
[2:03:26] on come
[2:03:28] on
[2:03:30] Amen I believe in a
[2:03:34] supernatural I believe he's real believe
[2:03:37] we serve a living God can I give you a
[2:03:39] testimony now you're not going might
[2:03:40] some of you may not like this that's
[2:03:42] okay but I say it again without apology
[2:03:43] amen I was I was in Mexico quite a while
[2:03:46] back and brother was talking to me he's
[2:03:48] telling me about an old Mexican brother
[2:03:51] that had really had this really strong
[2:03:53] faith praying praying for the
[2:03:57] sick he said that he's trying to deal
[2:04:00] with a devil that was in a woman trying
[2:04:02] to cast it out you still believing that
[2:04:05] here trying to cast it out he said and
[2:04:08] finally that demon spoke out of that
[2:04:11] woman in a man's voice and said she's
[2:04:13] mine and I'm not coming out and you
[2:04:15] can't make me
[2:04:16] leave he said and I didn't know what to
[2:04:19] do so I thought and I thought
[2:04:22] I had an idea and this is going to seem
[2:04:23] strange to you he said I went and got a
[2:04:26] book of brother brms I had a picture of
[2:04:27] him in
[2:04:30] it and I brought it back and I opened it
[2:04:33] up to that picture and I held it up to
[2:04:34] that woman I said do you know who this
[2:04:36] man is this is strange yeah come on
[2:04:39] Master he said that demon spoke out in
[2:04:41] that man's voice and said that's William
[2:04:44] brandham I was K I was I was thrown out
[2:04:46] of one of his meetings in
[2:04:50] Arkansas and so that old Mexican
[2:04:52] preacher said this he said then in the
[2:04:55] name of the Lord Jesus Christ whom
[2:04:57] William Brandon preached come out of her
[2:04:58] and he said the demon came
[2:05:01] out didn't come out because of brother
[2:05:04] brandom but it because it came out
[2:05:07] because he knew that that what that man
[2:05:09] stood
[2:05:11] for was the Living God not a Creed not a
[2:05:16] Dogma right right but the voice of God
[2:05:19] that could free you from the house of
[2:05:20] hell yes
[2:05:22] might seem strange to some of you this
[2:05:24] morning but what do others
[2:05:27] say and what do you say amen I believe
[2:05:32] that thou art the Christ the son of the
[2:05:33] Living God you know what Peter nobody
