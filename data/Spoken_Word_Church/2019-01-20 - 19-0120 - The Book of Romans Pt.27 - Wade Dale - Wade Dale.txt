========================================

yeah all rights record good okay all right here we are in Romans 12 excuse me we were let's go back to three two one then we'll go down and we'll stop them I'm busy beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service or rational service in other words we're supposed to act different you know then the more code says be not conformed to this world because listen you were formed in this world the flesh part of you was formed in this world your spirit came from another world the Holy Ghost is definitely from another legs but he come into this place and resides in you so that's what the paradox come from don't paint into them but as it got hung up in Illinois sending me pictures of deer so don't worry about this you won't see this no no we got we're gonna do this first then you can see this no my wife wants to snuggle bear' snowmaking machine next year I think let her stand out the argument be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind so it doesn't start with your mind as far as your gray matter because it's the same as it was when you went morning in but it's an filter it's what flows through that now when we sing the song flow do me Holy Spirit I think about that it he's not falling through your mind okay he's in your heart but he's trying to flow through the other parts that you know Graham talking about the flues getting stumped up well he can't flow right if you got flu stopped up but be not conformed to this world would be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove they may prove what God is doing is true through you write that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God which is his word as well as always his word right for I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you and sister not to think of himself more highly than he ought to taint now what's he telling him he comes up and tells around here do not be conformed to this world but prove the goodness that one perfect will of God so in other words don't think yourself any better than anybody else don't think yourself any better then that drunk on the street there's no devil snare drum on street oh thank God brother Brennan brought that out he says there's no difference in them and you except for the whole ego yeah caleche what's the determining factor in the bottom line you know you said well I'm we're up here with it bottom line is the drunk don't have the Holy Ghost you have the Holy Ghost so that's the bottom line right so don't think so much of yourself miss God did does it because it says for I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you think of a man that the grace was given to this man named Paul that his brother forty was talking last night literally had Christians killed literally not just figuratively he hated up the posse that rounded up the Christians and how until he even says he said I even calls him to bless me now what about a man then God's going to use one day but he's the one that's tormenting the Church of God right so I said so through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of myself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as God has dealt to every man the measure of faith and that's true we don't all have the same measure some are just real faithful people and some are just have faith and don't have to pray a whole lot some have to enter inch but you know what it doesn't matter I said bottom line is you're Christians and God dealt with you the measure of faith he knew how much you can take how much you come listen God know the whole thing yeah you knows what you believe what you don't believe all the way in but we don't and that's good good if we don't know the exact future no we know the future but we don't know the exact future you know it says in there what we're gonna do like brother twenties don't know there will be a body change and then that body changes through that light just gonna keep rolling and it's going to create a rapture yeah and just gonna keep creating you know keep rolling and gonna put us in them in them you know in what you want to say the marriage supper then in a millennium and it's gonna roll this right in the future home does it's gonna stop at once des destroyed any Christian but until that time we still have struggles and fights and all these different things for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office and that is correct we don't all have the same office our function like you know you look at if everybody was the CEO who's gonna do the work but you gotta have CEO you gotta have your financial people you gotta have your P&L people you have a profit loss person you gotta have your goddess and go down the dock puts the product in the car or in the truck you got the truck router and the truck driver you pay the truck driver to go do his job right yes all right so you gotta have that but you know what the CEO is very important but in fact I don't deliver that product that's the money part I mean idea filters back to the CEO but if that money's not exchanged or that products money came from you have no business so everybody is is basically if you look at a business you still wake up CEO but he's nothing if it's not for the guy that doesn't deliver he's nothing he said in his big office all he wants to but he ain't go getting the money in the bank account less the guy puts the product on the or puts product on your table get some money for it have you ever thought about that I mean being a little bit business money you said no you think when you're eating and you eat a meal and it cost you fifteen bucks which is about forty days now that will let me know about fifteen bugs but you think about that fifteen bugs that 15 bucks what does it do the same way with God I'm not getting off the subject but what do you do when you eat that and you pay that $15 that $15 if you say it is McDonald's that $15 is keeping that store running paying the employee without first paying for the food you got to pay food cost which is usually about 30% so then you got 70% to work with out of that 70% you got to pay the light bill the gas bill the water bill pay an employee plant supervisor and then you got to stand a certain part of that $15 to corporate to pay corporate salary and then what's left over the shareholders get so out of that $15 you're paying all that now you know you and I'm sure they break it down we used to break it down a little bit because you take percentages and usually you know you make about 5% so 5% of that $15 is $7.00 and I mean 75 cents so 77 cents yep thanks Ken you were selling something say it's that Stephanie senses what profit at the end of that $15 Bo Tom everything's paid out you got 75 cents left over well same Wang died God is not God can set up there and he's a little different from a CEO of though he owns the whole world and everything in it and he destroyed him brain back but he used its members you say how him angels yeah well let me stop here him Satan thank breakdance a dryad maybe it was him Satan the angel come on down to man and then I'll come on down the man with the Holy Ghost giving us members of a church and you can break your time down the same way you take your 10% of time whatever it is 70 80 90 100 dollars a week you put it in five over one spot one supply dude five paid salary thanks for the last to stay on page for us to send money to overseas and thanks for all these different things but God has set that up that way so we be many one company that's one of the sister last nights and how in the world do y'all get all this to work as big as the crowd as y'all have I said well brother Brown didn't say we were an organization baby just say we were an organism and a company as an organism it has different things it works together as an organism to keep it together to keep it working the same way with your body if you didn't have them little big cells in your body did little organisms your body a small apartment this way right you got to have your cell wall you think well I've never seen one before well you put them all together and guess once you got you guys all this same way with God so we being many are one body in Christ which he is the head right and everyone members one of another in other words the guy taking the money at the register he's gotta put the money in the register he's got a manager's got to make sure the money goes into the bank the bank makes sure he goes to the corporate corporate makes sure to go to the shareholders shareholders to the owner or owner usually as a shareholder so same way with God he needs us he said he needs us he need the body down here now but see you got to go back to parent say well don't be somehow minded see that's where people think on earth here that are not born again they and Babaji are gods cuz you know what these people figured out all this business stuff without even being Christian its me take the guy from that was on ya beat though I mean look he's he stood up this great Empire but his wife's divorcing him and she's going to give about 330 something billion dollars on his divorce settlement that ain't in God you know why because that's the imperfect man he set up a really good company he's got it running real good trust me my deliveries packages every day but being said that said but to have a perfect man in our in our government God Almighty right you say you got a government will have a government in the future home yes the kings of the earth will bring their till they must be some hierarchy out there somewhere but inside the city we're all one so you were talking about now the body of Christ that's why the body Christ is gonna be separated and we are going to live in a city but you know what we got twelve patriarchs we've got the twenty-four elders we got twelve in the Old Testament women in your Testament that's gonna set it somewhere because you see them when revelation five they're sitting on Thrones judging problems of Israel so this government's not bad when it's run by God okay government's wrong when the front of my man okay so be meeting one body in Christ everyone remember one of another in other words I gotta have my finger my hand would be nothing if I didn't have my fingers with me you know having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us until we each have gifts every one of us have a different gift whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the portion of faith of ministry let us wait on our ministry or he that teacheth on teaching or he that exhorteth on exhortation he they give it let him do it with simplicity or in other words let's see what that says in them liber liberality or in other words give it well no strings attached give it with with nothing - okay okay he that ruleth with diligence so he got a ruler yeah listen I don't mind you and I like we were talking about Sunday last onion we gotta have headship all of us brother Dale was our pastor he's our headship he's but now he has a head Christ so he lumps in his self into this body but he's in that chain of command that we that we have to respect that trailer come in collection week I set it up remember he said right here gifts prophecy ministry teaching rotation he did giveth he that rule it he's a show-off mercy with cheerfulness so we gotta keep ourself underneath that alright let love be without dissimulation in other words love be without hypocrisy because remember love is the most used word in the English language unions because we as Christians they're gonna want to know what real love is then you have some I say well I love football I love I love go hunting you know you say that you say these things but now they ain't love that's not the love guys talking about right no I enjoy going home I enjoy going fishing I mean oh boy but see the love has to be with God or I love Jim you know so that's your love that you give to who Christ yeah right let love be without dissimulation app or that which is evil cleave to that which is good in other words if you find something evil bob says resist the devil and he will flee from you cleave to that which is good so you have to determine which is good and evil but if we have the mind of Christ and we if we have all this filter coming down through apostles prophets pastors teachers evangelists God filters through their mind to talk to us then you and I have a part to do even though you're not a apostle prophet pastor teacher man do you have a situation where you go out into the world and they see you live in a different life for a Christian life and you tell them brother Brent until a fire got lit all right so you don't have to be standing on a street street corner with a guitar in the tambourine no just go to work be different they know you're different even your even your worth work ethic you know they I'm just I'm not gonna Pat myself on the back but listen I tell you I do do my job and I do it well so they gave me a Superman t-shirt for Christmas all the post all the postal employees and our thing gave me it meant Superman shirt for Christmas because they said you're super the other guy that I took his place was a sorry piece of mud I mean he was just complained and grabbed and never did anything out of kindness so I try to do that cuz I knew that guy was that weighing in you but you just do your job if you give it a job brother Paul say it a few but you gotta work if you don't work you don't need don't be a be like an ant see my bees my bees right now they're hibernating but you don't watch the bloom start blooming mama mama-mama queen don't have to go in there and say children it's time to go I said no there's something inside of them they know they're worker bees so they start bringing in to paly then the bee start cleaning the cells there's a different step for each one and they rotate as they die put the bee mm for 45 days so the newbies that come out the new bees they come out they clean their room first they clean itself then they help with what's coming in because they don't laughing right now same way with kids and they nurture them inside they're called nurse bees they nurse the larva well when they start getting a little bit older and the bees that help beat their wings up going out and picking up pollen they die but when they do these just go out and get on the infant's board and they fly out and go get the part of the Necker and then this whole new group comes in so that's where God wants it to be done you know you don't like that itself yes same buddy with us dude out of a cheerful heart be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love and honour preferring one another not slothful in business see there Paul I'm slothful in business fervent in spirit serving the Lord rejoicing in Hope patient in tribulation that's our problem we could go into a trial and we we want to all we want the trial to last about that long actually no sorry we want it to last about that long the beginning and end of your tribulation has nothing in between no there's a time in there because we're coming up to the sixth seal today in that state seal is the tribulation seal all right the sixth seal is a tribulation seal so we're going to talk about that there tribulation first and then our population that worketh patience continuing instantly in prayer as we were talking before and here's an example I don't it's something who gets Dutch guys prayer requests leave well I get it every day all right and I like it because you don't want to do I don't sit and pray for each person individually I'll read the name street that he's room is pretty long bit sometimes and I'll read the names drew and I'll just say Lord those names now have been spoken you know what's behind them so Minster teach one all right now there is time when one week we need to have for a prayer okay something happens to our body here or our while for our family we should you said well you shouldn't do that well no that's what we're human being my kids are more important than your kids I don't care how bad my kids are my kids are more important than your kids okay same way with God same way with you so we're human being so let's just get the cut the jump that well you need to pray yeah you need to pray telling you for everybody but you're wrong you pray for you kid if he's in trouble a lot faster than your pray for somebody else's kid that's just the way it is that's just human being but when your kid goes to a problem we pray with you but you pray further so you know you see one instant in prayer distributing to the necessity of saints now I take that as you can we help a lot of people monetarily materially but the necessity of my Saints I say my Saints are things here is that we get the gospel to you give you an opportunity to take that gospel and let it be revealed to you see that's distributing to the necessity of the Saints because you can't there's no way that you can I wish there was that you could everybody makes a mount of money everybody lived in the same house kind of house everybody live drive the same car see that but see that's not God God's got a variety right so we distribute to the next successive be of the Saints because like I said go to the bottom line the bottom line is if we can come into a place anywhere we preach and we nurture the people give them something to sustain them that we've done our job not handing out money or handing out cars or handing out you know that can all go away city of the saints is the revelation of the word yes that's exactly what I would say yes that's inductor right yeah that's the only necessity you should be worried with to begin with it says needs and the needs of the st. brother I've said what we're needy people given to hospitality and we do that bless them what's persecute you we hardly do that we never do that really I mean you know what that's true brotherly kindness it's really easy for me love the weeks because I love the week but now for me to love somebody that's persecuted me and hates me and don't even wanna be in the same room in to walk up and shake hands and hug their neck and say I love you and mean it yeah please people that's almost entirely impossible but that easy part is not what guys talking about that brotherly kindness does not just make sure you love the people that love you forget everybody else brother I've said love those who hate you and if he loved those people that hate him you say well it can't be done well Billy Paul's no remember the story he said you won't could not tell who hated daddy and who loved him now brother Brad imbue it by his Irlen he knew who liked him and didn't like him but he said he treated everybody man now that's to me that's I get no nothing that's why that brother counties is up her next to there come the word one yes well bless them to forget sure much is asking you shall receive it means to speak well of that is to bless religiously to praise celebrate with praises in other words praise the God that hates you number three to consecrate a thing with solemn prayer you know what brother Graham told us he said pray for those well know the Bible says pray for those who despitefully use you can you do that you better be able to go that's a Christian life do I that's right gratefully and that's the only difference listen here we go bottom line again bottom line is you know through the Holy Ghost and through your training of being a Christian you know how to handle things a lot better and different than people in the world that's just bottom line cuz that's what the Holy Ghost was given for right it was given to what teach you things to come he said well ox revelation of the word yeah well okay but still we got to live a life here first you know it teaches you how to be nice to your neighbor be kind to this one Beck just like just like all this well Joe Graham did say to that there are some people just sure he meant Christians and that's true there's people I love but I just can't stand to be in the same ring within y'all of the same way some of y'all with me out there don't mind me don't bother me none lluís loves me and that's all there Luisa's this month yeah you have that's why I love jesus loves me this I know but bless them was persecuting you so that and as truly that's what we have to work on yes we do have to work on that that's that's what I said that brotherly kindness went down here you think brother kindness to be down here faithful in the Holy Ghost coming and you're so sweet and there was no but no it's up here when you've got all days man that probably kindness but here's the thing also I think a lot of people get condemned as well when they feel like they just don't like being around somebody that has nothing to do with you loving death or that you wouldn't do something for that is what I mean that love but there's just you can't right wait but we associate that love with oh well you love a brother because he's not the love of God in him but he might have a attitude right that's not determining his out is here because look these are all attitudes every one of these is the attitude of a human being trying to be trying to be reversed into the gods see that we take our human version changing into God take our human knowledge it's good I'm human ology but if you don't have well knowledge of God that's what that is so what is this doing is trying to change our nature deprivation all these all these are character traits they you weren't born you were born with but they were all going in that direction not enough amount we're trying to reverse this thing to go up this mountain it's man right and not fall that's why they call it a fall you have a fallen nature and you fight it and you fight it and you we know that all nature's dead on the inside if you're born again the old Xers dead on the inside but you gotta fight that nature that you were given they stick to contact this world with on the outside or in the middle and nothing not to flash you understand what I'm saying but the little guy I'm telling you that if we we must see this revelation this is not to make your soul better your soul is Genesis 1:26 it never it is God that's it but you'll spare me on before this right here happen you have to let that inside perfect man out that you're of a perfect man you have to let that perfect man out yeah and let him do his work because what you're doing is you let that imperfect man in and he helped I took a picture of dad when he was preaching when his head was right in this is in the background upstairs what's that got to do what we're going on here oh well we need to talk about what's going right here that's it okay all right cuz it gets me off my thought I just watchfulness don't ya you must you must love your worldly people more than you love you yes brother than sister it's easy to have these people in the room it really adds when you get down to love because you got the love of God but that guy they don't ever go to church that guy that you work with every day that talks about the naked women and this I've done this and I've drunk a beer and I went to a party and I had a big time with him and he's trying to get you he listened to him well you know what if you say you just think man that that just don't interest me at all but you know either do that or what are you gonna do you're gonna stay well bless God I'm a Christian no problem about that junk will mean the more I don't want to hear it no you've just turned him off right there and you know what he's thinking inside of himself if I have to act like that to be a Christian don't want to be one that's what I've always said a lot of people you look at them and you go well I'm they say I'm a Christian I said no look if I have to act like that to be a Christian I want hmm yeah I don't want to be that see so but this is what stop listen well they always taught us Peter told us what to do but Paul's wanted told us how to do it right Paul is telling us in all of his writings once that statue of a perfect man is revealed to you you will see it in every verse because who is that perfect man it ain't Samuel down it's Christ in that person and then you see it live down now saying who do you give the glory to you give the Lord Jesus Christ amen Hey bless them which persecute ya you gotta do that I mean that's just what and I have learned you all gotta learn in your Christian walk brother branham say it he would eat God God would have some brother our sister say something to you to test your faith or to see how you'll react no he said God would do it now listen that's not for government that's not for God's will be that's for yours listen God knew Moses he knew every minut second of Moses his life knew he was gonna be at one time almost God well I mean you know he was it was Christ in Moses but then he knows over here that Moses is gonna fall a little bit why Christ speak speak to the mouth how many speaks of the rock he did and he smote it but God you ever been to that but there did I was just didn't know so Moses is the one that has to look back on his life and say that had to be God that did that yes ma'am that's that's the way you have to look at you have to us that that had to be God that did that because the old me that's why I like being a human being and God enjoy being a human being because he came down here to become one to save like well Joel said like last night God didn't have to die now he come down here in human flesh has milk hasn't eaten different things captain of the host but when he came down here as himself he didn't have to die he didn't have to die a penalty for his sinful he was sinless he died on a cross for you and me for our sins he did not he was not penalized for being a human being he was penalized for your sin as a human being so if you'll see it that way you'll know why God had to come down here in human flesh died a death for you so that you don't have to die and then see we in the end time we get that revelation and I hope we'll discuss it more unto the Seventh Seal we get that revelation that there's zero zero that Christ has to come back and do that's right that's right zero that's pregnant see we we're going well work we need a body change and we need healing and we need Donnie caliber remember brother Brown he said if God was standing here tonight in a three-piece suit he said he could not do something to heal you yes right so he came to them they can't come back to do anything don't think Christ is coming back forward for me he's coming back to get his body he's coming back to get his pride I like brother Joe did this for me we nobody talked about the I am huh I made you a sermon a little bit later on yeah I am but what she the bride is in Christ and all these things he's making a cumulated list of what brother branham told us we work okay cuz that's what he come back for he come back for uh a bride that actually he had before the foundation of the world because we can't not ever be his bride and then become his bride we always was his bride but he had to marry Israel first for all your tights to come into Vietnam all you types to come into view Naomi and Ruth they had to be an older one there to be an older woman that he married not so much old and age but the Old Testament he had to be married to them first good you know what he said listen he sent some of the greatest prophets in the Old Testament that ever walked on the face of this earth major prophets and minor prophet David Moses Abraham look at all these ones that he that he brought into being in the Old Testament and what they do to them they kill them yeah did he come himself in the middle of the book but now you say well Paul Iranians Martin well what a palms on when I wrote the Bible all the mother Old Testament Testament prophets wrote his estimate Moses was given five books to write then you got Ezekiel and Jeremiah and all these they wrote the physical Bible Irina's did not nepali big arenas did Martin didn't Columba did Luther didn't Wesley didn't sure they've been talked about in the Bible but they didn't write anything brother I've never wrote anything that's right he just gave us an amplified amplified version of what already had been written yes I mean look literally if we would have stayed with Paul's teaching I'm gonna get crucified for this one we wouldn't need brother Brenner if we stayed with Paul's teaching because what brother Brown come back come to do he come to do two things I know he come to the second part but the first part was to restore what was already in the old tent I'm in the book back from 47 to 63 a large part of brother Rams ministry was just to get us back to what was already in the Bible man had just met haven't made a mess of it right now we know he come to bring the seals and all but you know what Jesus preached the seals and Matthew let's back up a little bit farther than Jesus already preached to see Matthew 24 we're gonna read this afternoon he preached the seals Paul preached to all the major doctrines what was left brother mom had to come to restore back their lives a ministry to restore back and then not listen I just revealed to him reveal to a group a small real small group of people the revelation of the seal real small group of people no I just wanted it I was just wondering if what whether Brendan says that the Pentecostal Saints see they were closer to a rap to a rapture than we are one because they had the word down right okay they had the word down right but remember they didn't have enough for a body change because that had to come back with the son of man but now remember back on up Jesus already took about a penny right before the book of Acts he took a body change so there's everything right here body change resurrection one I'm sorry death burial resurrection glorified body was all before we even got to hold it up the whole that's what I'm telling you if brother branham's told us and I agree 100% if Jesus was to step in there right here today he could not change nobody he'd say look to me it's already done I wrote it right here it's in here somewhere you gotta find it but I'm already changed so if I change here change if brother Brown simply walked the shores of Galilee with Jesus Christ we were crucified with him we were resurrected with him so we obviously were changed with him we just got that carnal nature that still yeah that's one understand yes yeah yeah that's what we've been that's what we're saying brother Graham had to come to do the first part and then the second part would now remember Peter reveal a sealed room nobody that's right only Christ can reveal anything so who was it preaching those sealed series it was God himself but who did he change it didn't even change brother brother because he was prophesying of a group when he stood there on its own that questions and answers on the seal he was prophesying of a group to come so he had to pass away because you can't be a prophet and take a body chain you can be a prophetic people but you can't prophesy because the prophecy is I'm standing here and I'm prophesy of sister Barbara doing something I'm not prophesy to me I'm promise that God is talking through me and I'm problem that's why then she's got to say who's gonna change my body brother Dale you I am make it personal who's gonna change it he didn't he does not say if you say drew a profit this mountain to be moved Jesus turned one day and he said if you say cuz this mountain be moved and down on your heart I know brother Browns listen it's kind of tricky brother Graham said we have the staff to order be still but now this said Lord not going to change obey we get in some stuff here from the staff the Lord will not change your body it never changed nobody else's buddy Jesus never said that stay up the Lord and he got a body chain got him fully stocked fridge we didn't get down when we started playing with that last week
