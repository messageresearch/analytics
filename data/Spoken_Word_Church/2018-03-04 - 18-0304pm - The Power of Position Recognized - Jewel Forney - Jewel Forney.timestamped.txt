[1:10:57] baptisms that I've ever done in brother
[1:10:59] Colley we we baptized I think it was
[1:11:02] about four or five of his family one day

[1:11:25] you doing what's right
[1:11:30] I wouldn't cure to cut a hole - and
[1:11:34] baptizing it wouldn't bother me yes I'm
[1:11:37] a coach it's what you're doing it for
[1:11:40] it's a wonderful thing to get to be
[1:11:43] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:11:47] to fulfill his word and to believe it
[1:11:51] that's wonderful we just tell her
[1:11:54] brother how much you appreciate you all
[1:11:55] right we come to a time of communion and
[1:11:59] that's one thing we are firmly believe

[1:12:05] we believe in the communion we believe
[1:12:07] in the foot washing so we have all three
[1:12:10] of them at one time you know to come in
[1:12:13] and to thank God about all of it
[1:12:15] like I said we'd like to end it today by
[1:12:18] baptizing somebody if you want to add be
[1:12:21] fine you know we were baptizing with
[1:12:23] some really dicks family and one of the
[1:12:28] ladies came up she was thanking him you
[1:12:31] know because they wouldn't think and we
[1:12:33] was baptizing in just an old river I
[1:12:36] don't guess but they kind of dressed up

[1:12:41] she had this real fancy dress on it was
[1:12:44] oh it was fancy you know and time we got
[1:12:48] to talking just a little bit about
[1:12:49] baptism I said come on house and let's
[1:12:52] sit down and talk about it before we do
[1:12:53] it so we did we said discuss the baptism
[1:12:56] us any questions you got about it well
[1:12:59] she didn't come to get baptized there
[1:13:03] was other pimp members in the family
[1:13:04] that was you know we got through
[1:13:06] baptizing the others here she comes out
[1:13:11] in that muddy old creek with that fancy
[1:13:15] little you know sunday-go-to-meeting
[1:13:17] dress and she was dressed nice but she
[1:13:21] she asked me for she said I know y'all
[1:13:24] don't believe in wearing pants and
[1:13:28] things we said I don't have anything to
[1:13:31] I go home I said would it be all right
[1:13:34] said my was they married that time I
[1:13:37] don't know
[1:13:39] was he married into that it is engaged
[1:13:41] anyhow she
[1:13:42] he's got some pants should be alright I
[1:13:46] should wear I'm home
[1:13:48] don't worry move I should wear them
[1:13:51] because that's not right
[1:13:52] coach you needed some clothes even
[1:13:56] worrying him over that took care of that
[1:13:58] coz you see it was just being nice or
[1:14:01] okay let's go into the communion Paul we
[1:14:05] get into the Corinthians and I love it
[1:14:07] out of all of the great apostles and all
[1:14:10] of the ones none of them was given the
[1:14:14] opportunity to explain communion Paul
[1:14:18] knew all of that Old Testament tops and
[1:14:20] shadows and things he was chosen to
[1:14:22] explain the communion for have received
[1:14:28] of the Lord that which also I delivered
[1:14:29] unto you that the Lord Jesus the same
[1:14:32] night in which he was betrayed took
[1:14:33] bread and when he had given thanks he
[1:14:36] brake it and said take eat this is my
[1:14:39] body which is broken for you this do in
[1:14:42] remembrance of me
[1:14:43] and after the same manner also he took
[1:14:45] the cup when he had supped saying this
[1:14:47] cup is the New Testament in my blood
[1:14:49] this do ye as oft as you drink it in
[1:14:52] remembrance of me
[1:14:53] for as often as you eat this bread and
[1:14:56] drink this cup you do shew the Lord's
[1:14:58] death to become thought about in the
[1:15:01] message people are saying we don't take
[1:15:03] communion no more called the Lord's come
[1:15:06] well I don't think that's what he's
[1:15:09] talking about you know that part of it
[1:15:13] he come a long time ago he come me 2000
[1:15:16] years ago but you know cuz you gonna
[1:15:21] show his death till he come wherefore
[1:15:23] whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
[1:15:25] this cup of the Lord unworthily she'll
[1:15:27] be guilty of the body and blood of the
[1:15:29] Lord but let a man examine himself and
[1:15:31] so let him eat of that bread and drink
[1:15:33] of that Cup
[1:15:33] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:15:35] unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation
[1:15:37] to himself not discerning the Lord's
[1:15:39] body for this cause many are weak and
[1:15:42] sickly among you and many sleep first we
[1:15:44] would judge ourselves I love this
[1:15:46] scripture where we would judge ourselves
[1:15:49] we should not be judged
[1:15:51] now look though but when we are judged
[1:15:56] even if something were judged we're
[1:15:59] chasing to the Lord why that we should
[1:16:01] not be condemned with the world
[1:16:03] wherefore my brethren when you come
[1:16:05] together to eat tarry one for another
[1:16:07] and if any man hungry let him eat at
[1:16:09] home that you come not together in the
[1:16:11] condemnation the rest of us set in order
[1:16:14] when I come let's just have a few
[1:16:17] moments of silent prayer praying one for
[1:16:19] the other this is a time to pray and ask
[1:16:23] God to cleanse you to make you worthy
[1:16:25] because he's none of us worthy no no
[1:16:29] there's no human being in the world that
[1:16:31] is worthy to take the communion because
[1:16:34] we'd all be admit there's little this or
[1:16:36] a little that this little problem they
[1:16:38] would keep us but he said was perfect he
[1:16:43] required it morning Matthew 5:48 be ye
[1:16:45] therefore perfect even as your father in
[1:16:47] the evidence birth he required it he
[1:16:49] made a way that we could be perfect I
[1:16:54] see a sign you don't sit on a bumper
[1:16:57] stickers I'm not perfect I'm just
[1:16:59] forgiving everybody think well that's a
[1:17:02] beautiful statement it's not a good
[1:17:04] statement you don't even realize if
[1:17:07] you're forgiven there's nothing for you
[1:17:09] to be but perfect because you're not
[1:17:11] guilty and being not guilty it makes you
[1:17:14] perfect okay let's just have a few
[1:17:18] moments of silent prayer praying one for
[1:17:20] another
