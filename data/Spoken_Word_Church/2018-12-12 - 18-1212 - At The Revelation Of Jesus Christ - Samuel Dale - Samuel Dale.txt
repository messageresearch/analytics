========================================

that purchase though it be tried with fire might be founder to praise and honor and glory or at the appearing of Jesus Christ and having not seen you love in whom though now you see him not yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory what are you doing receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently who profits out of the grace that should come unto you now we're gonna get to the point in a minute at the revelation of Jesus Christ but I want you to I want your thought tonight in this line if he's Hebrews 13:8 no we believe it is then he's just as much in the Old Testament as he is in the New Testament right called us all the revelation of Jesus Christ we kind of look at it like seals and and Book of Revelations and things and we look at it as like you know a certain book but remember if he's Hebrews 13:8 then the Old Testament is just as important as the New Testament and Christ is in that Old Testament just as much as he's in the New Testament so then as you know that will be our thought for a while to try to make a an understanding of what we're trying to get because now what of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently who profits out of the grace that should come unto you searching what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow under whom it was revealed it was made known to them that something was going on you know they knew something was taking place but this didn't have a clear understanding of it under whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they'd administer the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which things the angels desire to look into wherefore gird up the loins of your mind and be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ all right now let's go to revelations 1 and we'll go verse 1 now remember there's to be something happen is to come forth from the Old Testament they spoke of it and all but then it's got to come into being all right into manifestation and there's I don't know how to say this part because it's in a thought pattern see there's a lot there's a gap between the Old Testament you know coming forth in the book of Acts and then it jumps to the Book of Revelations and I don't know how to make my point but to say that it is the unwritten through the ages all right then when it comes to the Book of Revelations then he writes it alright so there's a gap there I'll try to express that later in a message when we get to that point but I want you to think about it because here's what the Prophet had to say as we'll read in a minute paragraph 143 of the patents vision he says I want you to know who I am before I tell you what this is about in other words we'll read it a minute he's see he's wanting us to know who he is the first thing in the Book of Revelations I see watch the galaxy you got a gout from from what would you come up to Peter what's right for Revelation John James and I know and Jude all right now there's a gap between Jude I didn't look up to timewise but see timewise there would be a gap between Jude of 6m 800 or whatever it would be from dire - when John goes not just a to Patmos but it goes to Patmos and there's a time gap in that you you'll get the point of what I'm trying to bring so I'm trying to get you doubt in your mind to see how that you come to Jude earnestly contending for the faith nothing's written anymore then you come to John on Patmos and he writes it all right but it's not made totally alive not because she's not finished okay all right now we'll get to that as we go along because what's now the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John who bare record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written dar in for the time is at hand you may be seated the Lord that is blessing I believe that we're at the time to understand the time is at hand for us to understand now you you'll get the point because we'll we'll come back to this thought and we'll run the the thought over and over in your mind to to help us to understand what I was saying about a gap it's an unwritten part then it becomes written but remember he's writing about what has been what is and what is to be right that's how powerful the Book of Revelations is it's writing about what has been what is and what is to come November 18 95 96 somewhere in there John Lee alright now then there's a lot to come so we're going to get into at the revelation of Jesus Christ we're going to eventually come back to the point to where we can follow it as the alive word the alive word the written word is wonderful and I don't misunderstand the thought this listen to the point the written word is wonderful I love to read the Bible don't you I've always loved to read it and study it or hear it of somebody else I love that scovia wherever what his name is where he oh you know because he's so Scorpia were that he's so good at pronouncing them words and I I get up there to them and the best way to pronounce the word when you don't know how to pronounce if you just pronounce it did you get what I said I said users will pronounce it see that's the only way I could do a lot of them works but he's so beautiful and and bringing it out and I would like that but now listen because here's what we want to start with go ahead and pull number one up and we'll get started with our thought because this is what I want us to think on for a while all right now he talks about the trumpet and approaching the great one approaching but look he says I'm saying I'm out for the mega the first again not announcement now listen this is not announcement of the second person this is not an announcement of the third party you know person but the only party okay now we were up to one guard all right now so I want you to get that point cause when you read it and you read what the Prophet said the revelation that God or the scripture said revelation and God give to Jesus and it looks like two people will remember the pronounce then are there you know there is it's not that away now watch what he says before I show you anything I want to let you know who I am then the Prophet describes who is the greatest revelation of all things is the supreme deity of the Lord Jesus Christ he says now you can't get to first base until you believe and workout you ain't even gonna get started now and I see that's why the Bible cannot open the Book of Revelations would never be able to be opened I don't care what you would study it or try to do it it can't be opened until you get to starting in the right place and the start in the right place is just what the Prophet said said Jesus in other words God was saying before I say anything else and bring all this other out I want you to realize Who I am all right so the whole key to the entire revelation see we can holler and say we quote this we could go over and say the revelation of Jesus Christ you know and we can say upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it you know and everything and we we can go through all of that and still not have it the right place right we can go through all of that point and still be just as Trinity as ever because the Bible don't read if ur for a Trinitarian a Trinitarian read this and he said the revelation and God give to Jesus Oh God give to Jesus to give to John well that's got to be - all right so the key to the whole thing to understand the book of Revelation now watch my point to understand the book of Revelation is to understand the deity of Jesus Christ are the Godhead alright now then we can back up all the way to Genesis 1 and say the same thing that the only way you'll ever understand the Bible it does not reveal three gods it doesn't reveal three persons or anything like that it reveals one true and living God all right now if we don't get that one true and living God correct then how can we say we understand what's in between in other words if if the one that said in Genesis you know in the beginning God created now if that was a now listen to the wording I got no sister no Jesus wasn't about during human flesh it's that time all right but yet if that wasn't the Lord Jesus Christ that created all things new then you're messing up all right now you come over through and you're getting the proof and here comes and walks upon the earth now the very god of creation that was bat dire that said let there be you know which was the Lord Jesus Christ now not human flesh we're gonna have to separate that enough to be able to get an understanding because I don't believe most people understand one God you know yeah that's just the point that came to me and and when I read that he says now before I show you anything I want you to know who I am we'll see if we don't know who he is all right look where we are so we say sure he's Hebrews 13:8 where do we see him just as real back dark now I know you can't find the flesh until four thousand years later to come upon earth I know that this don't don't misunderstand my wordings and get lost in something I say but if he's Hebrews 13:8 he's the same God that done the creating is the same God standing here to appear to John uh-huh well what a wonderful position that one is standing there because who was that that was standing there speaking to John the Lord Jesus Christ well that says the father that was gifted all right that's where we're going a half to get the Godhead in the correct order to be able to understand anything about the Book of Revelations and then saying the gap that appears back here comes within and then come back to this reality you will never understand what took place and how God is is made manifest all right so now I walk your thoughts to being in one one concert it'll get more interesting as we go along come on but I lay down to start with especially when I know that I'm I'm going to get into a series I try to get your thinking as far up in that series is I can get your thinking and then we back up and climb up the earth alright so now the key to everything me see you get the point now listen we look at the Bible now come on you said no we don't we wouldn't know if I'm trying to express our thoughts cuz we do we look at the Bible and our thoughts in the Bible really in reality comes up to the book of Acts or maybe the writings of the Apostles and then we have a 2000 almost year gap you know 1500 somewhere your gap between the book of Acts are the Apostles and the the end of time where we're at that's got to be filled in he's got to be filled in there listen that gap has got to be fulfilled in with the revelation of Jesus Christ so it's going to require that we go all the way back to Genesis with our thought about Jesus Christ and not just starting on earth I ask the question here one time because we were talking about trying to go into an understanding of son of man and I asked the question I said what's the first time that you see son of God in the Bible and I wasn't talking about written out son of gods and I was talking about where was you first see son of God well everybody related to 2,000 years ago in the shores of Galilee because that's what you were thinking about son of God when brother Adam said the logos the creator was the word which was Christ all right and being that word the word created all things so then the son of God is the creator and that's exactly what Peter said when he refers to Jesus when Jesus said who two men say how the son of man am Peter said in other words it was blindness plain language saying I now this son of man you're talking about I don't understand cuz there was no way for him to understand that so he said but now I'll tell you what now are the Christ Christ means the Creator you know eating the cross the Creator he said dark the Christ the Son of the Living God never can answer looks down in there and he says we throw it in three lives 9 said there's another one down in there now and said it's like unto the Son of God looks like if he'd seen him physically looking he would have said the son of man they had no reference he couldn't understand that that is more of an endtime understanding of Almighty God all right and you'll see what I'm trying to get to with the whole thing with the the gapless telling it goes from here to here because he even though Jesus spoke Matthew Mark Luke and John son of man son of man son of man son of man son of man but not one of the writers Paul the greatest none of them spoke us on a man he said well Matthew Mark Luke that was the writing while they were dire none of the Apostles in their understanding anyway reference to son of man they called him a son of God so that's why he would be Hebrews 13:8 and that's why the scripture would say that the Christ the Son of the Living God do we really understand one God I say without the Prophet no we'd hoped to go with our 1,000% we because he was the one that toute it will get back to that later when we get into the message later on all right but listen father my thought before I show you anything of the ages or anything I want you to see who I am alright so he wasn't the first person now listen so yeah I use for no he was not the first person I'm gonna run city wouldn't a second for the third person second person he said he wasn't even the first person he said he was the person alright he said well I was just caught that's just play a word no it's not the person is different from just saying the first person cuz we say the first person that means in essence of English language that could be another person right well when he said it that way see it's clinches it all down all right now trying to get us out to word that we can go into this book of Revelation but I want you to get this before you get in there as I saying we say Bible and we think that the Bible would come up to where the Apostles were you say but I don't do that in yes I'm sorry the human mind does that then we want to take the Book of Revelations and make it something in addition or added it's not the book of Revelation is the revelation of Jesus Christ the book of Genesis is the revelation of Jesus Christ now are you followed my thought if he's Hebrews 13:8 then we've got to see him as what the Prophet said say he said if you don't see Christ now you didn't say Jesus because you can't get it the other way but he said if you don't see Christ in ever verse so then he'd be John 1 but he'd also be Genesis 1 the same one in John 1 that comes to 14 to make him flesh he's the same God that done the creatin alright do we understand it that way and that would put the Son of God back down which is the word the creator see then that would would bring us to an understanding of one God okay so I now get to thought then what we're trying to get to we're trying to anchor our basis upon one true and living God because that's the only place we can base it we can't base it upon our concepts or thoughts or ideas well I think there's got to be at least two of them that's what a man at work one time we was talking you know and I kept on bringing it down and I you know I was just letting him do it and I kept bringing it down and he said what he's got to be three well then I kept talking and quoting scriptures and tying it together and just letting it so after a while he said well I guess you're right there's really just two of them I said well beings you're putting it that away why don't you go a little bit further and do away with one of your other gods and you'll get to the right place you know see because if he'd done away with one if the word do away with one they would do away with the second one and we just start back over again you know all right cuz you see now what is one true and living God you know see then we'll we'll see in reality by looking at mankind our own thoughts of ourselves because the Bible can be understood by the things that you know are naturally out here that's the scripture you know it can be understood the eternal Godhead can be understood by the things that we see all right now I'm gonna quote this and then we'll get back to it so you'll see where I'm headed to the point that brother Branham says it like this it was God in flesh and Jesus was God in flesh but listen and the Holy Ghost tonight is God in flesh now listen he said tonight showing to the church bring into Pisces promises all right now so we look at mankind and we understand the Godhead that's where I love the Prophet when he would explain something you know them theologians setting our boy they got him caught he drove up here a little you know and then brother Branham would just simply go through and he said well let me just give you a little illustration said I'm a father and said it I'm a son and said I'm a human being okay then he'd say well okay can't you see God as being a father son and human flesh without getting your Trinitarian concept involved because I'm not three people I have many manifestations right there's many manifestations in the human element see because Jesus and you know manifest in see he was out for a mega beginning in Rhoda Sharon lily of the valley he had many manifestations but he was only one person so now remember we're trying to get to the point of understanding that he's he's not the first person because that would mean that could be other person he's the person now brother branham may I make the statement he might I like to do this with us as human elements brother Brown said now if he's not Almighty God you and I are the worst to see people are it and then the Trinitarians could argue we you just don't as much opponent because they got scriptures but there I was listening reading North today where he said said he coated coated he said he didn't quote it he said he coated the scripture don't my Satan and what he does all right now do you look look at the human element in the human element there is easily to be understood a body all right now within this body that I am there is a spirit that controls this body you know and moves and does and everything all right and then there is a soul within this being that we are and see why it's so important and then listen what I'm talking about see why it's so important to understand the Godhead and to see it in the correct order because see I know and I always make this statement when I'm in this references to it because I know what happened brother Branham in his early ministry basically talked body soul spirit I said basically I'd say every time God you didn't but then when you come along about 62 right at the ending up 63 getting into the seals then he goes the body spirit and soul you said what if he was wrong why didn't he change that he wasn't wrong because he always brother branham always told body of five senses the second realm of mankind whatever you want to call it whether you want to call it spirit or soul he always talked the second room as to how memory reason conscience affections love and all like that all right he always talked the center room no matter whether he called it spirit or soul he always taught it as the center of your being with only one sense of reality in that which is the soul all right now so then if we can see man and what he is and then follow that as in God and what he is because we're going to stay right here on this one thought or not you know that we're going to stay on the point he said I want you to see who I am before I continue to bring out anything else I want you to see who I am like I said isn't that wonderful then could he be Hebrews 13:8 he would be the great I am the Creator the Christ the Son of the Living God as Peter said now remember you said well that really don't mount a mother there's crossing and the son of living garden and son of my Anna what does it matter about that Brody Dalle he just gets into all these things and makes it look like he knows something well I'm glad I don't know anything but I know him I see Peter when he answered Jesus didn't say Peter you're wrong you need a little better understanding What did he say he said Peter you're exactly right that's who I am and sit upon this rock of the revelation of who I am I'm going to build a church and the gates of Hell cannot prevail against it said it be against it but it won't overcome it right see then he was saying you're the Creator God what greater honor could Peter have given the Lord Jesus than to declare him to be the Creator when we know the flesh wasn't back there right now think women and then we'll get back to a point I've given you these many times in the prophets message but sometimes it's good to just read again brother branham own the message called the darkest hour then Jesus comes along go ahead and pull this one up and look what he says he's talking about the woman what was that she said she pulled virtue that's the reason he got weeks he pulled from him virtue through that human body of his listen cuz he was just a man now listen you stopped and you got a lot of things you you stopped reading you you you say I got it now listen to what he said he was just a man born of a woman Wow was he just a man that was borned of a woman no he's emphasizing that he was just a man that was born of woman he was emphasizing awakening I thought we got another one in a second that'll clear it up all right so now listen virtuous hear that through that human body of his cuz he was just a man everybody run said now he wasn't just a man see get the emphasis brother branham brains in this message and that's why if you'll do this listen sir if you just do it sometime and you get something that looks contrary get the emphases or the connection or the way he's using it he said well he said here he's just a man no hearing this one he said he's not just a man now which one do I want I want both of them cuz they're right well how can that be right because the Holy Ghost can put it together cuz he was just a man that's expressing what he was he was a man but then he's saying now he wasn't just a man why because he was God created in human flesh okay listen born a woman but his father was God but in his body he was a man in his spirit he was God so God was in Christ and the woman pulling that verse you're believing it through him then he turned back to her faith it pulled it see and she said who touched me no now listen as I said if you just take now I know the story and I emphasize this and I try to because I believe it helps helps me anyway brother Branham says our American language or our english language whatever it's so messed up he said we just don't know right because he said now like bored he said you got the word bored he says you can say a board because it's the plank he said then you can say come on board and you can say I'm bored with you well the three is the way their use can be different about what's the approach but now I've always said it this way and I believe it because this is what he said he said to before in the after explains it all right now the before and the after simply means taking anything in context that's the best way of saying it cuz that's what I was meaning a minute ago take what he's saying in context take what he was saying he's just a man in context of what he's talking about then take that he's not just a man he was God that's another context or another thought pattern or structure uh-huh see the before and the after explains it you go in the Bible you take the word spirit there is no difference in the definition of the word spirit whether it be holy spirit man spirit or spirit you won't find a definition to death you know there to tell you which ones which but if you know what is being used how it's being used you got it in the correct order right all right see now so I can say to you I can say come on board this year stand on this board because I'm bored with you now what have I done I've defined or emphasized the point that I'm trying to make right and see that's why brother Branham will say he was just a man then he said what do you learn just am I in and see people thanks that's contradiction it's not contradiction it's according to what he's speaking of you got to get the Bible in the correct order then you see them before and after we'll explain it it is like I said you take the word spirit let's see now let's see let me give you one that is the exact word he wrote around said where it says you know the not eternal word it's what is the other one forever yeah forever and ever he said that can be eternity you remember that this court much tumba he said but now also you can say that it's forever and forever and ever it's a space of time right now you've just defined what you're talking about right so when Jesus said I and my father are one he's explained what he's talking about it's not confusing it's our minds that's confused because we think and we're all real good we like to do it I'm the first one to come up with that nobody else had caught brother Dale saying that wrong I called him saying it wrong well my lord if you just to come tell me I'll tell you a lot of other things that's wrong wrong you know you got no problem but you might find out it's not too much wrong sometimes I read a quote the other day and I got a emphases back from a brother and on a note and his emphasis was that he was saying that I had probably changed something but it wasn't I gave you a quote the other day were that it was coming down and John the Baptist forerun the Lord Jesus Christ no never and brother Adam actually say us he said John the Baptist forerun Malachi 3 now that's the exact word well that can't be true but the same one that was in John the Baptist that forerun the coming Messiah was the same Elijah spirit whatever reference that you want to add back dark all right see brother Branham is riding what he's saying a lot of time but he's wording and he literally said he said that John the battery's full run Malachi 3 well that's not true John the Baptist really full run the coming of the Lord Jesus cross see I'm trying to help you to understand to illustrate like run around said I'm a father I'm a son and I'm a human how many are there of me it's just one just one well it's just one God though the Bible's right that the eternal Godhead can be understood by the things we see all right what did we read here in his body he was a man all right in his spirit he was God no that's still own number one you wanna put it back up where we can make sure and get it but it wants you to behold at that point I like feller said one time he said well if we can't argue about it call you do at least read it but his father was God listen but in his body he was a man in his spirit he was God sees in God standing on earth was a body we called Jesus a man his spirit was the spirit is under Townsend divers manners that spake to the father's in the prophets is that Scripture and his soul is what the very soul of Almighty God see now you can look at standing there and there stands the Lord Jesus the body you can see the spirits you can see the things that it works and makes it move and doing and and calling out and pray in and etc within his soul is a very soul of Almighty God now listen you can go back in the Old Testament I invite you to you can have a knowledge of the scriptures you ought to understand this any way that you find a lot in the Old Testament spoke of the Spirit and you don't find this much spoken of the word soul last hour don't understand me it's in the Bible and it's written in there but the emphasis is not upon that because he was not making manifest himself at the time as to be one that could give his soul a ransom he had to wait until he come into human element to be able to give his soul ransom oh you remember in the psalmist he said I found the ransom see joke found all of them found him what'd he say I know my redeemer liveth then that word know there's a whole lot deeper than just to say I know my brain he said I know my Redeemer liveth all right but now listen I ain't going a little bit further so we'll just take some reading cuz I want you to make sure and get it go to number two which is taken from excuse me that was yeah number 276 God keeps his word look I believe that in his body he was a man now here's where he explains what I said there well ago he was borned of a woman just like I was now watch him now taking that as a statement without correction and understanding what do you got you got a human element in a sex act but listen to it he was borned of a woman just like I was but his blood was not of a woman it was God and Jehovah God too low gosh who brood over the earth and my message this morning and rude the first man out of the dust of the earth overshadowed Mary and booted brood over her to fulfill his word and created the blood sail that brought forth the son of the Living God I believe in body he was a man I believe in his soul he was God he was God's manifestation here on earth so just look at that man as you see him and I said a moment ago that you can see him that in his life he could stand and go back into people's lives and and things you know they couldn't argue with him about the things because he that spirit that was within the Lord Jesus Christ would just go back into their lives and and he could explain these things and express the things as he did throughout the Gospels through his spirit because that spirit was a spirit and sundry times and in divers manners that was back there you don't see much references to the soul because it's not needed to reference back there to the soul it's there but it's not needed to references reference to that spirit all right and then when he came into Earth what happened a body thou hath prepared me now God provided a body to come and step into the God himself provided a body to step into he had done it on occasions of Melchizedek's and the different things but it would just be in and out in and out here he comes as a baby brother branham in façades and he said little Jehovah crying in a cradle lose your hova with no teeth now watch the reference did we make brother branham in his reference he said see there he said Jesus never called Mary his mother you remember that wasn't out what did he call her when he was 1 2 3 & 4 5 years huh come on be sensible he called her mother right his reference is calling it so that it would not put have to hit that she would be his mother that brought him because God created right God created what it took to make that body so when he said now she never called him mother to see that he called her him woman will see that's what he done on Calvary right do you father what I'm saying I'm trying to get your mind to thinking a little bit what a mind was a young it's running like a sewing machine going out the other end and you're not paying attention to what's being said see looking at a little baby laying in a manger there was Almighty God Elohim the self existing one laying in a cradle crying as a baby calling Mary mother her mama whatever you gonna call but it was not in a reference code he could not die for us as a baby it could not be your savior as a baby you cannot be your savior at 12 13 years of age or whatever when he come to his bar bar over how you say that word nevermind just kidding see he couldn't be your Savior even at 30 years of age he had to come to the time of AIDS and right before he could pay the price right then that would make him the savior are you listening trying to get a point to where we can see it there stood Almighty God as a boy running about upon the earth body now listen body spirit and soul to use this wouldn't mean anything to you but in the Baptist Church I heard the doctrine that man didn't have a soul maybe you've heard it or heard of it there was a doctrine back there that man didn't have a soul until the law okay because you had no conscience no no controlling factors or nothing that was a doctrine I see that doctrine among the people of this message cuz you see these people that are saying now that Jesus wasn't God till the River Jordan according to my Bible he was born God see they don't see what happened he was the Anointed Messiah sure on the River Jordan he became the anointed anointed right I agree with that I believe it - probably taught it he became annoyed kid with the fullness of the Godhead bodily what does that mean it doesn't mean he didn't have God back here it meant there some things about God that could not be made manifest as I just said the baby laying in the cradle can manifest a healer a savior it can't be done just looking at a simple little baby that you see you hold him didn't realize God can be seen well that brother now this is what I've been accused of so I say it don't matter if brother Dale you just making God to calm or to natural all I'm trying to do is read what the Bible said the Bible said God was in Christ reconciling the world and do himself I mean I didn't write there the Bible says of body thou hast prepared me I didn't Rock him things and Jesus standing there unless it shorts the father he said look if you've seen me you've seen the father right where was the father at he was right there standing in front of mankind was the very Almighty God that's why people couldn't understand it cuz they said you are to listen they said you are a man man I gotta get this right now you are a man making yourself God no it was God making himself a man they had it backwards he didn't have it backwards he was standing there as Almighty God not that there's another person up in heaven called the father and the sons over hearing the Holy Ghost and over there I had a better understanding of that not in the Baptist Church I admit it I had him so much one until he couldn't even stop his toe I had a lot of reading to do and I'd read a lot of it you better believe I'd read over and over but when brother Branham come along and said you know they beat him that was when I dropped that part of that Godhead I thought I understood maybe you've never dropped a lot of the things that you thought when brother mote nailed my hide to the wall and said now he's a father he's a son and he's a human he said but how many people was he I said wouldn't but one he said then you're just as much trinity as they are because you believe in three person I said I don't believe that anymore that's solve that I didn't have to wait three weeks and go to the seminary or ask anybody else how to do I've seen right then if I'd went back to my pastor and asked him we would have been in bad shape so I didn't go ask him I went to the head man I went to God himself I said lord thank you for revealing that to me and I don't see that three no more so now I know what I got to do I got this water baptism facing me and you don't realize what I meant so I was a Baptist deacon at 23 years old so you know they thought a lot of me and see I knew the Baptist doctrine the first thing the Baptist doctrine you can't have anything contrary to their doctrine listen you go right now you go right over here and join this church they won't ask you how you're baptized they just take you in you go down to the Methodists you go down to the Pentecostals you go to maybe somebody might catch on and say a little bit but you go to a Baptist Church today and you join that Baptist Church the first thing they're gonna ask you how was you baptized oh I was baptized name of the Lord Jesus Christ you will be baptized again before you become a member of this church that's Baptist doctrine that ain't just hearsay go check on it you won't ask June she you know if we don't throw off on it she done exactly what everybody else had done she went back and done that they made her get baptized again but listen Church what I'm trying to get you to see is how real is your God well I don't understand brother call my father I talk to him he's up in heaven and Jesus said on my father one now where's your God remember that background of what we're talking about before we go into anything in the church ages any thoughts or concepts in the ages and whatever to fill in this gap we must first see who he is see and he said what will it was a revelation that God give to Jesus to give to John and we'll get to that just remember the revelation that God gives to Jesus to give to John was the things that Jesus didn't understand when he was here on earth I've got the quotes don't worry about it he said but now to this time and his mediator will work he doesn't understand the future and everything you say yeah but but you're making it too you're making it why how could Jesus be God and not know everything oh I'm glad you thought of that I just read that the Holy Ghost in flesh in Jesus made him God you remember that or you read it well then the Prophet said and the Holy Ghost in you thanks God in your flesh the only problem is what I can only get the new Birds which is the birth of the soul now Jesus didn't need that birth because his spirit was the spirit under times and divers manners but his soul was the very soul that come all the way through that Old Testament and bringing it right down and never come into being in its fullness until a man walked on earth the soul is not it's back there you can pull it out if you understand things and read it you can see it because listen if you look at something that your prophet kept telling you about the soul that is very marvelous he said the soul is the nature of the Spirit right now if you go back in the Old Testament looking for a nature you gonna find his soul because that's what he is I tell you what though when he wrote the Ten Commandments I like Gary Atkins where he used to say he said we read them Ten Commandments and said we say no I shall not kill nice y'all not steal see like a mean hateful Oh granddaddy figure of a hatefulness reading a little deer that's y'all not kill change is it doing that's y'all not steal change the whole thing and then when the Prophet come in there with his anchor of the ten commandments always anchored within me when I read it he said call the 10 commandments - seals now you tell me the Ten Commandments is a book of rules I'm gonna ask you the seal to book a route I'm gonna ask you how the can the seal of God that reveals a the Holy Ghost itself be a book of rules I want some answers to some questions folks we're not playing games if you're gonna see one God get down to the basis of understanding brother Brennan said there was only one difference between a born-again believer in Jesus Christ now who wants to tell me what it is there's only one difference between a born-again believer and the Lord Jesus Christ he said that's the body that he lived in come on the body that Jesus lived in was not a sinful situation he knew no sin that Scripture are you following me about the Godhead Jehovah came down and was made tangible by living in the body of his own son declaring and recognizing the world to himself reconciling the world to himself that's on the message that's still on that now let's see where ya the Hebrews chapter number four three number three was made tangible by living in the body of his own son he was the tabernacle that God dwelt in what am I what my brother Dale he wasn't that - we've got brother so-and-so that teaches it he wasn't that until the River Jordan well I think we need to dish throw the prophets message out the door and I'll go up and follow that if that's what we think right but I don't think like a I believe the scripture that he was born Lord the crotch eight days later he got the name Jesus he was born Lord the Christ he was born Jehovah he was God in human flesh that human flesh was a human element as we just read not of the blood of his mother no with the blood of God I know and I hear brother Branham saying everything I'm not throwing off on nothing but people likes to sing that song now his royal blood now flows through my back no no no they ain't no royal blood at this day rowing in through your veins it's Dale and colleagues and Gabriel's fountains that's running through our blood running through our bodies those are good statements with very little background me I have a coach see we're gonna have to have a body change to have a body like unto his glorious body all right we got to come to a place to change this one okay but the new birth has already put him inside of you that that spirit in that man would know everything but remember one time and I'm gonna throw this out and listen Jesus didn't know everything and the courting brother branham him according to Bible they asked him in the Bible when he was coming he said I don't know said the father hadn't made that known alright we get to the book of Revelation so he said now at this day we understand he is alright me okay now think about it Jesus Christ was God that's the number four bottom part of what we had on on the other which is why Christ speak yet he was the son of God his flesh was the son of God because God created it but inside he was God it's not me said Jesus this works it's my father that dwelleth in me and that day you'll know that I'm in the father and father me and I and you and you and me now this conference number five he thirsted like a man he was a man in his body he was a man in spirit he was God God dwelled in Christ reconciling the world to himself he said bring me a drink he was thirsty all right now what is it you ever heard bread around him like this statement he said at times it would be Jesus speaking he said it was times would be the father speaking you ever heard that you see as father he would know when he was coming but in his form of son he would not know he say well that's impossible brother Deo you're trying to make it to carnal I'm trying to make it just as straight as I can what is that in you sometimes it tells you things is right or wrong when even the natural flesh says no you ever been another way your head God to speak to you and tell you something when literally as human elements you stood there saying no no I told you about the man that came here I try to illustrate it with that the man that came here with the church that stayed with us for quite a while he was real humble feller and prayed a lot and this is everything cried in the altar every day every service he was in and one day I walked up to him here in the church and I said brother I said something's telling me that you're a government agent you've heard the story ain't new you ought to know it ain't alive cause at least I told if I did I told it 10 times or 40 times back before this lie either way you wanted I don't care I just know what happened in human flesh I was weeping because this man was so humble and me telling him that he was a government agent I said just do a good job mister don't lie about us ain't no need of it that's that I ain't gonna tell nobody he stayed for three or four weeks man he left went down to Atlanta I didn't tell nobody for three months why because my human abilities of all things that I was was arguing against whatever told me that was you ever had it to do that your head Lord tell you something now come on let's get down to real good about you remember when you saw water baptism name the Lord Jesus Christ you remember that it's contrary to everything in the world wouldn't and you knew 90% of he knew you're gonna be towed out of the church the minutes you got baptized Lord Jesus Christ right you knew you and heading out of that church and see humanly speaking you didn't want to believe that something spoke to you is it hard then to conceive a thought or understand that God and Jesus was one human element but they was a human element of him called a human flesh that had a brain that had all the capacities and everything we do as human beings brother and the scripture says it and brother brother said it he said I'd do nothing till the father shows me is that right then Jesus never done nothing till the father showed him the rest of you showed him a vision you know whatever art are you in me just thinking about how real is your God didn't there's no need to talking about the Book of Revelations or what we can understand this isn't that isn't that what it is for that until we understand who it is doing the talking yeah well I've been taught it was a father and a son the holy goat so have we all welcome to the crowd well came through that but does that make it right no let me ask you straight on this question are you willing to die for what you believe you're willing to die for the fact that your baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is correct I'm just asking a simple question he's saying nothing when you got done draw it out and start shooting about it we're just talking asking you how real is your God then you might be able to father it a little bit and look back down and see that Melchizedek walk out to Abraham and who was melchester Almighty God not born of a woman and come up that way that would be left for the fact of the body that would be brought into the world for the purpose of dying melchester that couldn't die for you he wasn't in that capacity but brother Branham said he was a man the Bible says he was a man well you mean to tell me you think God is a man no I won't tell you the Bible and the profit both says he is now you do what you want to about what you think about what I say but just remember the Bible said then he was a mine well you know if he's Hebrews 13 nights and he still got to be a man how real is your God now let me ask you a question if I'm right about what I've said I think I am but I'm just saying it that's up to you if I'm right about what I've told all the years and not just tonight because that says what I've always taught on the one true and living God won't ask you a serious question could your revelation produce a lamb to pay the price for you could you stand this John and say behold the Lamb of God that takes away my sins could you stand on that could you follow him throughout the word and see Almighty God as he was manifesting himself like I said we we don't think about the Old Testament we think you see who's a mean hateful oh oh dude there's a lot of things I'd like to talk to you about in the Old Testament to where you can see the the Christ the nature of Almighty God if you just look at it right you can see his nature his ways and everything right throughout the Old Testament and you can understand a lot of things that mankind has never had the ability to understand how that Almighty God would forbid a man to marry a woman that was you know the wrong top right does he tell us not to tell you that true but then he turns around one day to his prophet needs to go down there and marry that and how children bar read your Bible you might find a few things that's interesting well you don't want that same prophet after a while that woman left him went off of somebody else I didn't say go down there and cut her to pieces and kill her and divide her up and do this he said go get her and bring her back he went and got her brought about and had more children see we just don't read the Bible all the way through read it for yourself and see where it's after but you understand see you can look back there and see how that God would kill those people for doing certain things you can't see the grace of God his wage trying to bring out in Grace and things if you can't see the Jesus of the Old Testament just remember David that had a man kill which was his greatest buddy a man that wouldn't even go home to his wife when he just laid at the door and wouldn't go home so honored David David had him killed Nathan comes to David and he says David said songs will happen this happen that happened David says bring that man here and I'll kill him he didn't mean nobody else gonna do it he said bring him here I'll kill him what the Prophet say he said David thou art the man but watch him redress your Bible he said what you ain't gon die he said David said there's some problems here in this lineage is in time but said you ain't gonna be able to build me a tabernacle so we're gonna leave that for Solomon your son David says glory hallelujah come on boys I want the Cedars out 11 them I want to read you Bob David the equipment for Solomon to build the temple he brought it all and set it down and said Solomon built the temple read your Bible there's a lot of Grace in the Old Testament if we just look at it and right away it's not disgrace either it's real truth my god is so much Grace and so much love until he told King he said if you'd have done right you'd have been accepted oh of course the people in the message say no that's a lineage it cannot be accepted well God said it and the Prophet said he said it so that's all I wanted to know what about it come on musicians I just asked you he said now I want you to know who I am then we'll start talking about these other how real is your God I'll reel let's see we don't take the scriptures well brother tail there he walked upon the shores of Galilee and everybody saw and the Bible says no man has seen God at any time I like that you know why because God was in Christ veiled in a human vessel to pay a price reconciling the world to himself that's why I love the word so much it's got its own answers but we have to let it understand we have to let it be what is that see now just study there in the in the first chapter and then we'll pick up a few things a few thoughts and and we'll go on in to because I want to get into the church ages where I want to get because my point then I started this you remember my point I said we're gonna get into the each age the overcomer you don't want that age that overcomers you ain't Jesus he's me and you what do we got anybody have a need the altars open see just think about how real is God now there you make him so real it seem like that and he's just tangible to you well why not why not why is he not tangible to you well I've never seen him what does that mean he's not real what about it hot what have you saying boy [Music] [Music] [Music] seems to Louise's family believe in Friday we had them with a prayer clocks the other night but just come on up and let's just lay hands on them and say well okay we're gonna all believe that everything is well you got the prayer cloths you got

safe journey let everything be all right we love you and we thank you we've already given the prior clothes and all the things but now we just little something personal to say according to the word

God and take care of give them a safe journey in Jesus name Amen anybody else would have a need for tea once just remember Randy was in Christ in you don't forget that greater as he enemy radar is saying that I am a man he that is in the world say is like a roaring lion roaming to and fro seeking whom he may devour the Bible tells me so many souls have been many have been destroyed so they never come to church but God has promised us today is this remember to my power no matter if Luther 20 minute really come on even they didn't understand he never give a red alright see that is a man then he's right in the midst of that jerk when Luther named as left as much as he was down in the new borrows [Music] baptize you dismissed if the service is sunday pray one for another with a Power greater than any earthly for I'm so glad I've got it [Music]
