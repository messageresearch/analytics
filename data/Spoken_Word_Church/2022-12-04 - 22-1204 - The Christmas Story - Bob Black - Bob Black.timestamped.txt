[0:00] normal Sunday school lesson and just
[0:02] talk about what this this Christmas
[0:04] season is really all about
[0:08] and uh just study on the Christmas story
[0:11] for a little bit
[0:12] oh God we're so grateful to be able to
[0:14] gather together this morning Lord and I
[0:16] pray Lord that you're just bless the day
[0:17] and uh bless brother Wade as he's
[0:19] preparing oh God and bless our hearts
[0:21] Lord Jesus to receive and to be edified
[0:23] by your word this morning Lord we ask
[0:25] your blessing
[0:27] today in your name amen
[0:31] now Matthew chapter 1 and verse 18 says
[0:34] now the birth of Jesus Christ was on
[0:36] this wise
[0:37] when as his mother Mary was espoused to
[0:39] Joseph before they came together she was
[0:41] found with child of the Holy Ghost
[0:44] then Joseph her husband being a just man
[0:46] and not willing to make her a public
[0:47] example was minded to put her away
[0:49] privilege but while he thought on these
[0:52] things behold the angel of the Lord
[0:53] appeared unto him in a dream saying
[0:55] Joseph thou son of David fear not to
[0:57] take unto thee Mary thou wife for that
[0:59] which is conceived in hers of the Holy
[1:01] Ghost
[1:03] and she shall bring forth a son and thou
[1:05] shalt call his name Jesus for he shall
[1:07] save his people from their sins
[1:09] now all this was done that it might be
[1:11] fulfilled which was spoken of spoken of
[1:13] the Lord by the prophet saying Behold a
[1:15] virgin shall be with child and shall
[1:17] bring forth a son and they shall call
[1:18] his name Emmanuel which being
[1:20] interpreted as God with us then Joseph
[1:22] being raised from sleep did as the angel
[1:24] of the Lord had bitten him and took unto
[1:26] him his wife and you are not till she
[1:29] had brought forth her firstborn son and
[1:31] he called his name Jesus
[1:33] now of course we know that's the the
[1:35] greatest gift that's ever been given to
[1:36] the world and this time of year uh you
[1:39] know all around the world people are
[1:40] giving gifts and let's just you know
[1:42] brother Brown said in the message he
[1:43] said Christmas now has changed the way
[1:45] we take Christmas if you ever studied it
[1:47] we are taking the Roman Catholic
[1:48] Church's conception of when Christmas
[1:50] was
[1:51] now I'm not going to read through all of
[1:54] these notes here but you can kind of
[1:55] skim it if you want to but the the uh
[1:57] the reason Christmas now is on December
[1:59] 25th is because the Romans used to
[2:01] celebrate this Festival of Soul Invictus
[2:03] their Sun God on on the December 25th
[2:06] and uh it said the cult of Soul Invictus
[2:10] was centered in Rome but it was followed
[2:11] across the Roman Empire
[2:13] Soul Invictus the god of the sun was one
[2:16] of the most important gods and he
[2:17] symbolized victory
[2:19] as he defeated darkness and Rose every
[2:21] morning Soul Invictus was the patron of
[2:24] Roman soldiers so you can see how
[2:25] Constantine when when he said he began
[2:28] when he decided to convert and said he
[2:30] had a spiritual uh experience he it
[2:34] would make a lot of political sense to
[2:36] just combine these two holidays the son
[2:38] of by the birth of the Son of God with
[2:40] the with the the the the date that they
[2:43] were combining
[2:44] um the date that they celebrated the
[2:45] rising of this this sun god Soul
[2:48] Invictus on December 25th brother
[2:51] William said actually Christ could not
[2:53] have been born on the 25th of December
[2:55] and be according with the scriptures
[2:56] because there's 30 foot of snow in Judea
[2:59] in that time
[3:00] so they it could not been Shepherds out
[3:02] on the hills and so forth they had been
[3:04] contrary to all nature he came like
[3:06] nature he came like a little lamb that's
[3:08] born in the spring last Springtime all
[3:10] the all the flowers are blooming and
[3:12] everything and that's when Christ came
[3:14] uh brother Raymond the pergaman church
[3:16] age he said now notice that Constantine
[3:18] gave special feasts unto the people they
[3:20] were the old Pagan Feast with new names
[3:22] taken from the church or in some cases
[3:24] Christian rights were taken an abuse
[3:26] with Pagan ceremonies he took the
[3:28] worship of the Sun God and changed it to
[3:30] the Son of God instead of celebrating on
[3:32] December 21st which is when they used to
[3:35] celebrate the Feast of the sun god they
[3:36] put it up to December 25th and called it
[3:38] the son of God's birthday but we know
[3:41] that he was born in April when life
[3:43] comes forth not in December now look at
[3:47] that if you want to see what Constantine
[3:48] looked like there it is that the church
[3:50] in Rome began formerly celebrating
[3:52] Christmas on December 25th and 336
[3:54] during the reign of the emperor
[3:56] Constantine and Christmas didn't become
[3:58] a major christian Festival until the 9th
[4:00] century now there was this guy um this
[4:04] this this uh saying that the uh that the
[4:06] Catholics have venerated called Saint
[4:08] Nicholas of Myra that had a he he was a
[4:11] um you know I really he did a lot of
[4:14] good deeds and one of his most notable
[4:15] D's was he would go around and he he
[4:18] gave there was some some girl three
[4:19] sisters that they they were gonna have
[4:21] to turn to prostitution if they didn't
[4:23] get a dowry for a good husband so he uh
[4:25] around cover of night he gave him the uh
[4:28] the money to to be able to provide for
[4:30] him and did a lot of other things like
[4:32] that where he would give gifts uh in
[4:34] secret without anybody knowing so he did
[4:36] you know a lot of good things and so the
[4:38] Catholics uh you know how they like they
[4:41] like to venerate uh dead people and and
[4:44] give worship to Saints and so forth so
[4:46] they they would they had this Festival
[4:48] on December 6 every year where they
[4:50] would give gifts in honor of Saint
[4:52] Nicholas of Myra that's where Saint Nick
[4:55] comes from now the reason Martin Luther
[4:58] when he began to had that Awakening and
[5:00] the reformation and so forth he he he
[5:02] began to realize we don't need to be
[5:04] doing this let's shift the focus up of
[5:07] this man we want to shift it to Christ
[5:09] so he said cry he said Christ is where
[5:12] you get all your gifts from so let's
[5:13] give gifts on December 25th not December
[5:16] 6 and even today in Germany if you go
[5:18] and see where they'll say they they're
[5:19] getting gifts not from Saint Nicholas
[5:21] but from Chris Keane and Ken does the
[5:23] the German word for you know like a
[5:25] child like kindergarten so they call it
[5:27] Chris canned so the custom of giving to
[5:30] children at Christmas was propagated by
[5:31] Martin Luther as an alternative to the
[5:33] previous very popular gift custom on
[5:35] Saint Nicholas to focus the interest of
[5:38] the children to Christ
[5:40] so brother Brown said so as we This Time
[5:42] of the Season as we focus our thinking
[5:44] towards Christmas it's too bad that we
[5:46] have to allot it to a myth called Santa
[5:48] Claus and instead of the real Christmas
[5:50] that is supposed to be many little
[5:52] children in the land today know nothing
[5:54] more than Christmas Means a sleigh full
[5:56] of toys and some Mystic reindeers
[5:57] bouncing on the house to only learn
[6:00] later of this myth to even hurt their
[6:02] faith when it comes to know the true
[6:04] Christmas story that it had nothing to
[6:06] do with reindeers or a man smoking a
[6:09] pipe with fur around his coat how would
[6:11] it hurt your faith is because we want to
[6:13] tell the truth we want to tell our kids
[6:15] the truth and if they find out that
[6:16] their parents told them a lie
[6:18] um then it then then they begin to
[6:20] question the reality of everything else
[6:21] that they've been told in the in Divine
[6:24] Healing brother Brown said and the fact
[6:25] of all the error and everything there is
[6:27] about it there's something about it that
[6:29] the world tries to make it an Excellence
[6:31] you know but God still got a Christmas
[6:33] in it somewhere hasn't he he's your ass
[6:36] he's got something about it just the
[6:38] very names and the thoughts of the birth
[6:40] of the Lord Jesus Oh the world's put
[6:43] Santa Claus in his place sure but not to
[6:45] the Christian it's still a Christmas and
[6:48] aren't you glad this morning that we can
[6:50] do like Martha Martin Luther did and try
[6:52] to divert the people's attention back
[6:54] from Santa away from Santa Claus and
[6:55] away from Saint Nick and away from
[6:57] veneration of saints and and uh and even
[7:00] looking at the Soul Invictus and all
[7:02] those things that the Romans had put in
[7:03] and looked straight to Christ because
[7:06] that's that's what that's what it's all
[7:08] about is about Christ now now to get to
[7:11] the Christmas story Jesus said he said
[7:13] think not that I am come to destroy the
[7:15] law or the prophets I am not come to
[7:17] destroy but to fulfill so everything in
[7:19] Christ's life was to fulfill the word
[7:21] and the first thing the first thing
[7:22] about Jesus's birth did uh it fulfilled
[7:26] the scripture in Jeremiah that said my
[7:29] voice is heard in Roma Rachel weeping
[7:31] for her children now now if you look on
[7:34] this map you probably can't see it real
[7:35] good but just just there above Jerusalem
[7:38] and red is a little uh city right
[7:40] outside of Jerusalem called Rama
[7:43] now brother Brown said it had to be just
[7:46] at this time when this murderous King
[7:48] Herod nothing but a murderer killed all
[7:50] those little children that it might be
[7:52] fulfilled which was spoke of the Lord by
[7:54] the prophet saying in Rama Rachel
[7:57] weeping weeping for her children and
[7:59] they were not
[8:01] now you think about in Genesis I got
[8:04] some notes here that just say and Rachel
[8:06] died giving birth while on the road to
[8:08] Bethlehem in the midst of her suffering
[8:10] the Midwife tries to comfort her with
[8:12] the news that she is having another son
[8:14] and this way her child is both her cause
[8:17] of weeping and her hope for the future
[8:19] so we've got a story of of death but
[8:22] then there's hope something to look a
[8:24] promise to look to and Jeremiah's day
[8:27] when he wrote This Promise Rachel was
[8:28] weeping over her children once more
[8:30] because they were being led into
[8:31] captivity in Exile near that very same
[8:33] spot where she's buried
[8:35] but they were comforted with the promise
[8:37] that her children will return
[8:40] somebody's not happy
[8:42] once again her Offspring her both her
[8:45] cause of weeping and her hope for the
[8:47] future and in Matthew's day Rachel weeps
[8:49] yet again this time over the slaughter
[8:50] of all those children that a Herald was
[8:52] trying to kill because there was a child
[8:55] coming a child of Promise so in the
[8:58] midst of Sorrow There's Hope coming
[9:00] forth
[9:01] now Herod raise those taxi he raised
[9:04] those taxes raises taxes to to force
[9:06] Mary and Joseph back to Bethlehem where
[9:09] the the scripture in Micah chapter five
[9:11] two there's another scripture that's
[9:12] being fulfilled but thou Bethlehem and
[9:14] frata thou thou be little among the
[9:17] thousands of Judah yet out of thee shall
[9:20] he come forth unto me that is to be
[9:21] ruler in Israel whose goings forth have
[9:24] been from old from Everlasting
[9:27] uh in in Matthew Chapter 1 Verse 18 it
[9:30] says now the birth of Jesus Christ was
[9:32] on this wise when as his mother Mary was
[9:34] espoused to Joseph you think about think
[9:36] about all the grief that that little
[9:37] girl had to go through all the to being
[9:39] looked down on saying that she was
[9:41] living uh living in sin and and Joe the
[9:44] situation here that's unfolding that
[9:45] Joseph was it was a mature man and he
[9:48] was a widower he already had four kids
[9:51] and he was a just man
[9:53] when this situation unfolding a
[9:54] scripture is being fulfilled brother
[9:56] Adam said she told she must have told in
[9:58] this young virgin beautiful young Jewish
[10:00] maid she become we're all adults here as
[10:02] far as I can see she become to be mother
[10:04] and Joseph going with her noticed this
[10:07] no doubt after he was espoused to her he
[10:10] found out that she was to be mother
[10:13] now he was a just man the Bible said he
[10:15] was she must have told him of her
[10:18] innocence the lovely woman I can hear
[10:20] just as it were to say Joseph my beloved
[10:23] friend my beloved husband I am innocent
[10:25] of this
[10:26] and she must have told him of the visit
[10:27] with her and the great Archangel that
[10:29] the Archangel had come to her Gabriel
[10:31] and had visited her with these these
[10:33] great signs that he had told her about
[10:35] that what was going to happen
[10:38] and Joseph being a just man he kind of
[10:40] wondered you know now I know if she's
[10:42] caught in adultery the first thing is
[10:44] going to happen to her she's going to be
[10:46] stoned
[10:48] she cannot so to Joseph it seemed like
[10:50] that Mary was trying to get him to be
[10:52] her shield from the scoffers and
[10:55] scorners see Joseph was to be her Shield
[10:57] go ahead and marry her anyway anyhow and
[11:01] be her Shield but not to be a husband to
[11:03] her in the family of relation
[11:05] God has at all times all ages spoke to
[11:08] his people that the scripture says while
[11:10] he's thought on these things
[11:12] he thought on what his actions should be
[11:14] and what the situation was is this
[11:16] really true behold the angel of the Lord
[11:19] appeared unto him in a dream Satan
[11:21] Joseph thou son of David fear not to
[11:23] take unto thee Mary thou wife for that
[11:26] which is conceived in hers of the Holy
[11:27] Ghost
[11:28] God has at all times all ages spoke to
[11:32] his people and revealed himself by
[11:34] dreams now dreams are not an assurance
[11:37] every dream is not from God now there's
[11:40] many people that has dreams and they
[11:41] have all kinds of dreams and you go to
[11:43] bed at night and eat a big supper and go
[11:45] to bed and you might dream anything you
[11:47] might have a fever you might have all
[11:49] kinds of nightmares and so forth that
[11:51] isn't God but yet God does deal with
[11:53] people through dreams if you'll notice
[11:56] when you read this story of how specific
[11:58] God was when he when he gave this dream
[12:00] to Joseph there wasn't any and there
[12:02] wasn't any need for any interpreting he
[12:04] was very explicit with what was going on
[12:06] he knew he knew what God was trying to
[12:09] tell him a spiritual dream
[12:12] is interpreted rightly interpreted as
[12:15] the same as a vision and what is a
[12:18] vision a vision is the forecast of
[12:21] future events
[12:22] it foretells the thing before it happens
[12:25] and that's the way God always Vindicated
[12:27] whether it was true or not or whether
[12:29] the man that was in the Old Testament
[12:31] was supposed to be a prophet what he
[12:34] said come to pass then they knowed if
[12:37] this man said this and they kept
[12:39] constantly coming to pass now that man
[12:41] cannot just be laid hands on him or
[12:44] shook up and give a gift he is born with
[12:47] that gift born in him when he's born
[12:50] before he's born
[12:52] he pondered on these things it was so
[12:55] unusual he could hardly comprehend that
[12:57] how could those things be I think maybe
[13:00] if we meditate on these things this
[13:02] morning this is almost the same
[13:04] situation is unfolding now that what
[13:05] that that Joseph had a promise that
[13:08] Christ was going to be born that he was
[13:10] going to be born in a manger now there's
[13:12] a promise that Christ is going to be
[13:13] manifest in this day and you know we we
[13:16] can ponder about things how can these
[13:18] things be but when Christ when God comes
[13:20] down and reveals it to you then then you
[13:23] are willing to become a shield to the
[13:25] word you are willing to take on all the
[13:27] reproach and all the rejection and
[13:29] you're willing to take on everything
[13:31] everything that's necessary to see God's
[13:33] word fulfilled
[13:35] and brother Adam said he no doubt sat
[13:37] down prayed over it studied it in the
[13:39] scriptures how could these things be
[13:41] while he was studying the angel of the
[13:43] Lord appeared to him in a dream
[13:45] if you'll just yield yourself to God God
[13:48] has gotten many ways that he can reveal
[13:50] himself to you see he might not you
[13:51] might not be a prophet you might not be
[13:54] a teacher you might not be a Sunday
[13:56] school teacher you might not be a
[13:58] preacher but there's ways that God can
[14:00] reveal to himself to you you see isn't
[14:03] that interesting that while he was
[14:05] studying the angel of the Lord appeared
[14:06] to him in a dream
[14:08] whether it might be dreams it might be
[14:10] in some other way if you'll just submit
[14:11] yourself like Joseph did
[14:14] um somebody was sharing me recently they
[14:16] were listening to brother George Smith
[14:17] talk telling some folks about how if you
[14:20] want to be closer to God then then this
[14:22] and and you know we don't believe in
[14:24] making New Year's resolutions but I
[14:25] believe in putting a stake in the ground
[14:27] and saying I'm going to be I'm going to
[14:28] try to do better and brother George said
[14:31] if you want to next year you want to be
[14:32] closer to God and just just say ever
[14:35] every day I'm gonna I'm gonna just
[14:37] listen to 20 minutes of a sermon and
[14:40] just read one page of the church age
[14:41] book and just read one page out of your
[14:44] Bible and come back next year and see if
[14:46] you're not closer to God
[14:48] so you see while he was studying the
[14:49] angel of the Lord appeared to him and if
[14:51] you if we'll open ourselves to open
[14:53] ourselves up to God and and just submit
[14:55] submit ourselves like Joseph did then
[14:58] God will do something in our life
[15:00] now then God sent his Angel and revealed
[15:02] it his revelation of the dream to come
[15:04] to Joseph he knowed there was no mystery
[15:07] in it there was no mystery in it the
[15:10] angel came to him in a dream he saw the
[15:12] angel in his dream
[15:14] then when Joseph Rose from his sleep oh
[15:17] how his heart must have been full of
[15:19] newborn faith and when God in any way
[15:22] that he desires to do it reveals to you
[15:24] the question that is that's in your mind
[15:26] there's no more doubt there's no more
[15:29] question about it it's a revelation
[15:32] and everything everything about the
[15:34] gospel has to come by Revelation
[15:36] otherwise we're just probing at it like
[15:38] Joseph was probing at it is this child
[15:40] really something from God or not and we
[15:43] pray when we hunt is this message really
[15:45] true is this is this something that's
[15:47] really from the Lord but when God comes
[15:49] down and reveals it then then there's no
[15:51] mystery in it anymore and you have
[15:53] confidence in it you know it just like
[15:54] Joseph and you he knew he knew enough to
[15:57] have confidence to take on all their
[15:59] approach of Mary and protect her and be
[16:01] her Shield
[16:03] when a man can be revealed that Jesus
[16:05] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[16:08] forever no matter how many Creeds try to
[16:10] turn it back you're glad to be a shield
[16:12] you're happy to be a shield let them say
[16:15] whatever you got a big Shield up there
[16:17] to knock the fiery darts off and that
[16:20] means they can say whatever they can say
[16:22] well all of these things that the
[16:24] naysayers say about the pictures and the
[16:26] pillar of fire and all sorts of things
[16:29] that they've on their websites but but
[16:31] you've got a revelation so you're glad
[16:33] to be a shield because you know you know
[16:35] the doctrine you know God has revealed
[16:38] it to you you're happy to be a shield
[16:39] you're you're a doormat whatever wants
[16:42] to be it doesn't matter it's been
[16:45] revealed to you by the Lord
[16:48] then when the king gave his commandment
[16:51] just when the Christ was being formed
[16:54] now let's take them just a moment just
[16:56] when the Christ was being formed all the
[16:58] government came against them and
[17:00] everything let's watch them carry them
[17:02] just a little bit before we close I can
[17:03] see Joseph say Mary darling that cruel
[17:06] King
[17:07] but she'd say listen to her remember the
[17:09] Holy Ghost told me that his name Shall
[17:11] be Called Jesus and he shall save his
[17:14] people from their sins
[17:16] now Joseph dear no matter what takes
[17:18] place and what the king says I am able I
[17:22] can sit up on the little mule at several
[17:24] miles up around these Rocky Mountains
[17:26] and so forth your brother Brown said in
[17:29] one place every Christian is going to
[17:31] have a positive confession to say that
[17:33] I'm able I'm able to to travel the hard
[17:37] over the Rocky Mountains and over the
[17:39] hard places
[17:40] and he said if we happen to need a
[17:42] little help there'll be many in the
[17:44] journey because we're not the only
[17:45] family there's others that suffer the
[17:47] same thing we have so there's others
[17:50] along the road and we can kind of go
[17:52] along with the rest of the crowd as they
[17:54] go up the hill and go up into Bethlehem
[17:56] or from Nazareth they come up across the
[17:59] mountain
[18:00] now we find out that he must have got
[18:01] the little donkey and fed him an extra
[18:03] bunch of hay and some Oaks that day
[18:05] because the little lady was pretty heavy
[18:07] so he sets her up on the little meal and
[18:10] puts a bag of water and a few little
[18:11] biscuits and gets the little donkey and
[18:14] gets his stick in the hand and up the
[18:17] road they start
[18:18] over the little mule is staggering and
[18:20] falling oh look where that little fellow
[18:22] is packing look at his burden what it is
[18:25] he's bearing the Christ to his
[18:27] birthplace and here this little woman
[18:29] sitting up on there in pain to be
[18:32] delivered holding it to the Mane of the
[18:34] little mule and speaking to him as she
[18:37] goes along the road
[18:39] now I hope maybe you can read you know
[18:41] the gospel is in layers and you can read
[18:43] that there's there's something that can
[18:45] be applied to us in this day that you
[18:47] know brother Ryan preached that message
[18:49] birth pain as you go along the road and
[18:51] you're packing the word and it's gonna
[18:53] come forth despite all the all the
[18:55] Staggering and falling and all the all
[18:57] the tribulations of life yet there's
[19:00] going to be a birth and that's that's
[19:03] what we're that's the that's the
[19:05] objective and brother Brown said finally
[19:07] it began to get dark Travelers along the
[19:09] road much more able to travel faster and
[19:12] they'd come on by and she had to breathe
[19:14] the dust to the rest of them upon horses
[19:16] and carriages and so forth that they
[19:18] could go over it because she had to
[19:19] travel real slow on the account of her
[19:21] condition what a cruel thing to send
[19:24] that mother up there in that condition
[19:25] but I can just imagine now and the
[19:27] little drama as they come up to the top
[19:29] of the hill Bethlehem sits in a kind of
[19:31] a valley and on the West Side of the
[19:33] Mountain of Bethlehem the mountain where
[19:34] the little Trail comes out up comes
[19:36] comes up the stars begin to come out
[19:39] and after a while he comes up to the top
[19:41] of the heel and once again they look
[19:43] over into the city where they were both
[19:45] born over in Bethlehem the lights of the
[19:47] city many was there places was crowded
[19:50] people on the outside sleeping on the
[19:51] ground out along in the fields and the
[19:53] question perhaps the first time then
[19:55] struck Joseph's mind
[19:57] what will I do if I can't find a place
[20:01] because that baby might be born tonight
[20:03] she's been in pain all day
[20:05] so now what if that baby
[20:08] is to be born tonight
[20:10] so the stars begin to come out
[20:13] you know in in the Bible there's
[20:15] prophecy there's there's promises that
[20:17] in Isaiah 60 that the Gentiles shall
[20:19] come to that light and Kings to the
[20:21] brightness of thy Rising the multitude
[20:23] of camels shall cover Thee the the
[20:24] dromedaries of median and IFA and all
[20:26] they from Sheba shall come they shall
[20:28] bring gold and incense and they shall
[20:31] show forth the Praises of the Lord now
[20:32] that promise had to be fulfilled
[20:34] in Psalm 72 the kings of tarshus under
[20:37] the Isle shall bring presence the kings
[20:40] of Sheba and sheba shall offer gifts
[20:45] was the name given by the Babylonians
[20:48] the medes and the Persians and others to
[20:50] the wise men teachers priests Physicians
[20:53] astral in other words to some spiritual
[20:55] people that had had been listening to
[20:57] Daniel when he was when the Israelites
[20:59] went down into Babylon and they could
[21:01] have had heard that all these things of
[21:03] the Prophet that that Daniel had shared
[21:05] of the Prophecies of Jeremiah and all
[21:07] the other prophets that that was going
[21:09] to come
[21:10] the Messiah was coming so they were
[21:12] looking for him and when you look for
[21:14] him he's going to appear to those that
[21:15] look for him
[21:18] brother Brown said nobody saw the light
[21:20] that Paul saw the same thing it struck
[21:23] him down on the road up to Damascus but
[21:26] it was given to Paul nobody saw the holy
[21:28] ghost coming like a light out of Heaven
[21:30] A Dove but John saw
[21:32] but he saw what he bare record he saw it
[21:34] the rest of them didn't he did for he
[21:36] was looking for it the Mage I were
[21:38] looking for it and when you are looking
[21:40] for it when you are ready to receive the
[21:42] real Christmas present the real
[21:44] Christmas gift God's Christ's gift the
[21:48] Holy Spirit you're looking for it you'll
[21:49] see it it's a Heavenly light sit down
[21:52] from God out of Heaven to Bear record of
[21:54] Jesus Christ
[21:55] now they didn't take anybody else's word
[21:58] in the daytime it was Restless they said
[22:00] oh I just can't wait I don't know how
[22:02] much longer we'll go we'll probably go
[22:04] to Jerusalem or down to the holy lands
[22:06] Palestine because that's where the
[22:08] prophecy said that this one is to be
[22:10] born at so we'll find it sooner or later
[22:13] oh we could have that perseverance like
[22:15] they did say I'm I'm gonna find out for
[22:18] myself whether it's right to search it
[22:20] out in the like the bereans did to see
[22:22] see whether this message really is true
[22:24] if they're really if that promise of the
[22:26] Holy Ghost really is for me or not and
[22:29] and and to travel and do whatever I need
[22:32] to do to get it now you think about
[22:34] this wasn't just a little uh just a
[22:37] little Excursion with some some gas
[22:39] stations along the way where you could
[22:41] stop and get you some beef jerky and
[22:43] some some root beer or something this is
[22:46] a long trip it was 900 miles that you
[22:49] journeyed all the way from over there in
[22:52] Iraq and you can see the journey you
[22:53] think about
[22:55] how long will it take to go 900 miles
[22:56] years it would take years to go that
[22:58] owner on camels stopping along the way
[23:01] having to worry about people robbing you
[23:03] on on the way but but they were after
[23:05] something they were after a promise
[23:07] because they were looking for Christ
[23:08] appearing
[23:10] so it says in Matthew Chapter 2 and
[23:13] we'll stop after after this he said now
[23:15] when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of
[23:17] Judea and the days of Harry the king
[23:19] behold there came wise men for the east
[23:21] of Jerusalem
[23:22] saying where is he that is born King of
[23:25] the Jews for we have seen his star in
[23:28] the east and are come to worship Him
[23:30] when Herod the king had heard these
[23:32] things he was troubled and all Jerusalem
[23:35] with him and when he had gathered all
[23:37] the chief priests and scribes of the
[23:40] people together
[23:41] he demanded that the more Christ should
[23:43] be born
[23:44] The Magicians can go ahead and come
[23:45] forward and they said unto him in
[23:47] Bethlehem of Judea for thus it is
[23:50] written by the prophet and thou
[23:52] Bethlehem in the land of Judah are not
[23:54] the least among the princes of Judah for
[23:56] out of thee shall come a governor that
[23:58] shall rule My People Israel then Herod
[24:00] when he had privileged called the wise
[24:02] men inquired of them diligently what
[24:04] time the star appeared and he sent them
[24:06] to Bethlehem and said go and search
[24:07] diligently for the young child and when
[24:10] you have found found him bring me word
[24:12] again that I may come and worship him
[24:14] also when they had heard the king they
[24:17] departed and lo the star which they saw
[24:19] in the East went before them until it
[24:21] came and stood over where the young
[24:22] child was when they saw the star they
[24:25] rejoiced with exceeding great joy and
[24:27] when they were coming to the house they
[24:29] saw the young child with Mary his mother
[24:31] and fell down and worshiped him and when
[24:34] they had opened their Treasures they
[24:35] presented unto him gifts gold and
[24:38] frankincense and myrrh
[24:40] aren't you glad this morning that we
[24:42] know the reason why we give gifts and
[24:44] why we try to help one another out and
[24:46] why we worship that we're not just
[24:49] believing in some vain Roman tradition
[24:52] of Soul Invictus or Santa Claus or Saint
[24:55] Nicholas but we can serve a living God
[24:58] God bless you
[25:00] [Applause]
