one acts chapter one while we're turning there and the brothers are bringing it up we just want to thank god for this past weekend services appreciate what the lord how the lord spoke amen i believe he was trying to go through a certain avenue amen if you notice even there at the end brother mike ulti kind of got off his notes there on sunday and just started something was pulling him or someone was pulling him so god god is it god is mindful of each and every one of our needs spiritually praise the lord so he is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart he knows what you came to church for he knows what you what's really in your heart and he will be able to discern that i don't know brother wade doesn't know brother dale doesn't know none of us know but he knows and he and he can speak to us directly to that need whatever you have need of this evening god is god knows praise the lord and that's a comfort to me knowing that we have a god that knows all things when we have no control of some things there's some things that we have no control of but he's in control and all he wants is if we could just give it over to him amen that just releases a burden from us and it it it helps us to just say i'm free thank you jesus and when he does the work as i've always said when he does the work he does it right when we get our hands in it and try to do our own you know in it it comes out wrong but when he does it and you just release let go and let god have his way whether it be for your children whether it be for your family whether it be for your sickness amen and god is going to do it and it's going to do the work right i'm so thankful that we serve a god like that amen praise the lord jesus let's uh let's read in acts chapter one and um you know we've been we just celebrated easter and we we celebrated the uh the resurrection of the lord jesus christ and and when we and as we're certainly thankful for that and we appreciate the lord for for what he did because that needed to happen it was for an example to us amen who i mean god can't stay dead amen uh he's god he's he's the author of life amen so he must needs come from the tomb but i wanted to i wanted us to look at just a little bit of the things that happened after the resurrection just shortly after the resurrection and there's some interesting things that took place so that's why i call this the 40 days after the resurrection and then just because the bible tells us that jesus was with them about 40 days and we're going to read here in in acts chapter one and there were some things that took place and some and some uh uh some interesting uh events that took place one of the things that i want you to concentrate on is that he was always appearing there was always a seeing there was always an appearance there was always whether there was a conflict between faith and doubt amen there was a conflict between do i believe or or not or am i going to continue even though the good the good times are over or am i or am i just going to settle you know and just just relax i'm going to go fishing like peter said i believe a lot of people ever since the the prophet left the scene some of them went fishing and they never came back amen so these things took place in the in the disciples lives and some of the other people that that jesus appeared himself to and uh so we want to look at some of these things through this through the lens of the scriptures we're just going to just kind of go over some some scriptures i'm i'm not going to keep you long tonight but uh and then afterwards we're gonna i'm gonna show you some uh some updates some missionary updates so it won't we won't we won't be too long so let's um let's read acts chapter one it says the former treaties have i made o theophilus of all that jesus began both to do and teach until the day in which he was taken up after that he through the holy ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen to whom also he showed himself now verse 3 says to whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs so there were many infallible proofs that took place after his resurrection being seen of them 40 days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of god so jesus was was still about teaching about the kingdom of god amen and we know the kingdom of god is the holy the holy ghost amen and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father which saith he ye have heard of me for john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence when they therefore were come together they asked of him saying lord will thou at this time restore again the kingdom to israel so they were still carnally minded thinking that the kingdom was something physical something tangible somebody was going to come in and destroy the the romans and kick to take them out of jerusalem kick them out and jesus told ministry was not about that it was trying to preach to them a a spiritual kingdom when they therefore let's see okay verse 7 and he said unto them jesus said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his own power but ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you so he takes them away from the thought of hey stop thinking about that this is what you need to be concentrated on that the holy ghost has come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and in all judea and then samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the earth and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight and while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel now we'll we'll look at something there in just a moment but verse 11 which also said ye man of galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven the same jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven then return day unto jerusalem from the mount called olivet which is from jerusalem a sabbath day's journey and when they were come in they went up into an upper room where abode both peter and james and john and andrew philip and thomas bartholomew and matthew james the son of alphaeus and simon zelotes and judas the brother of james these all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication with the women and mary the mother of jesus and with his brethren praise the lord and then uh just one more scripture taking advantage while you're still standing first corinthians chapter 15 verses 3 to 8 paul speaking here he says for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures and that he was seen of cephas which is peter then of the twelve after that he was seen of above 500 brethren at once of whom the greater part remain unto this present but some are fallen asleep after that he was seen of james then of all the apostles and last of all he was seen of me also as one as of one born out of due time amen let's just bow our heads this evening lord jesus father thank you for the opportunity to read your word lord father we sometimes lord god we read the scripture so fast and maybe lord we don't have time to sit there in in in and just masticate lord god almighty on each and every verse lord what you have in store for us father we ask that you would just help us this evening help us to receive something from you and lord uplift us father god those that are weak father god in spirit lord those are that are heavenly father sick father and body may you just come lord and minister to them lord jesus and you just be our portion this evening forgive us for our sins father lord god we can't forgive our own sins but we know that we have father you lord god who is our advocate lord jesus who you're our judge lord god you're you are you are our lawyer lord god you're everything father god and you're our only hope father in this time lord god when there is no hope in governments and there is no hope father god and kings and and queens and and leaders of father god there's only a hope father in the king of kings lord and that's you lord jesus we thank you father god we love you and we commit this time into your hands in jesus christ's name amen you may be seated this evening praise the lord what a time that that we are living in saints where the world is falling apart you know brother brown preached that message the world is falling apart and then he preached a message of world falling apart again and now we can say the world's really falling apart again amen it's it's fell apart and and if you still have your hopes and trust in in in in kings and and and donald trump is going to come back and just save us all you got something else coming you better trust in the lord jesus christ you better trust in the word amen because that's the only savior that we have amen i see every single aspect i mean you know food chains breaking down all kinds of things that they're already saying the store shelves talking about store shelves going to be uh low in food for the in the next six to eight months what are we gonna where are we to trust i mean that's what they're predicting i got we sell on amazon and some products i can't even get products from china anymore because they got them stuck in boats over there in shanghai due to coven so uh so you know so there's gonna be a lot of amazon sellers that they're gonna not get paid for a while so things are breaking down but we know heaven and earth will pass away but his word will never pass away praise the lord jesus so that's i just want to put my trust and confidence in him amen praise the lord jesus amen so 40 days after the resurrection and if we turn to to john and the brothers can go turn to john chapter 20. i just want to take a look here at the after the resurrection of jesus because john gives us a little bit more details here as to what happened in the different areas and i just want to kind of take a look at the different at the different scenes and and just kind of see take a couple of things from there you know the after is in verse 11 it was when mary magdalene um let's see actually all right so from verse 1 to verse 10 is when jesus when peter and and john they they heard that that you know that jesus resurrected from the dead and they ran to the tomb right and um we see that they that peter outran john and and he he was he was interested in what and what taking place and the bible says there in in verse in verse 8 that then went and also that other disciple which came first to the sepulcher and he saw and believed for as yet they knew not the scripture that he must rise again from the dead after jesus had told them so many several times in the scriptures that he was to rise again but peter and the disciples still couldn't believe the things that had taken place amen that our lord are the one that that we were looking to everything was uh we were having such great wonderful healing campaigns and and such wonderful uh uh services with the lord and and here's the one that we put our full trust in and and now he he's gone and we're looking in the tomb and and and he's gone he's not there all we see was the folded napkin and the and and and his vestures that he was wrapped in amen which that has a significance within itself amen they say that that that that the bible takes uh uh it takes time to tell you in verse six and seven verse seven says and the napkin that was about his head not lying with the linen clothes but wrapped together in a place by itself it took it took time to tell you that so it must be some significance to that i was kind of looking into that and and they say that in jewish tradition that when a servant is serving the king or master of the house that when he sits down and uh when he's done eating or if he's not done eating but he needs to be excused maybe to go to the restroom or something like that he'll put his napkin down and he'll fold it which means that the servant knows not to take his plate not to take not to take his drink not to take his cup and maybe because he's still not finished he's got a work to continue to do amen praise the lord jesus and that's what our lord jesus christ did amen in verse 7 amen he he folded it neatly amen because he wasn't done with his work amen there was still a work amen and i believe that that work is for you and me amen he knew that he had to come amen 50 days later through you through the disciples amen in the form of the holy ghost and to continue that work and i believe he's still continuing that work in this hour saints that's why he folded amen that napkin amen he folded and he took time to do that to show to show amen i'm not done amen i'm not done praise the lord jesus and so the disciples that peter and john they got there and the bible says for us yet they knew not the scripture that he must rise again from the from the dead and verse 10. it says then the disciples went away again unto their own house and i wonder if that's just kind of how we how we are sometimes hey we we haven't experienced we we went to see amen we went we experienced something and then we just kind of go to our house amen and not thinking about what what what just happened not thinking about the scriptures that we just heard not going back home and maybe taking time to to read the scriptures that were just read to us or that you studied or or the sermon or going back and listening to something maybe because i guarantee you you don't get everything in in one sitting amen i appreciate brother ryan and them they they sit down and they they they masticate if you know what masticate means it means to chew amen you continue chewing until you just get all the juice out then you can swallow [Laughter] and according to what they told me they go back home and and they listen because a couple of days later you might get an email or text message from saying hey brother i was listening to you know and it's encouraging amen i appreciate that praise the lord amen something that we should consider doing more often amen including me i i don't do it like i need to do amen but but some but here the disciples they experienced this but here look what happens in verse 11 it says but mary stood without at the sepulcher weeping i mean she didn't go home she started she stood by the sepulcher weeping crying i wonder what she was thinking she was thinking our lord was here our lord jesus was here and somebody went and she was probably thinking somebody took the body we don't know where the body went but but but she's crying and probably thinking and reminiscing maybe of the things that the lord had done for her mary magdalene being one of the one of the ones who i believe had seven seven devils amen and the lord amen cast seven devils out of out of mary magdalene amongst other things amen and she saw and she experienced the the the ministry of the of our lord jesus christ and in the verse it continues and as she and as she wept she stooped down and looked into the sepulchre in other words she was still interested in what was going on in there amen she was still interested amen and then watch in verse 12 and see if two angels in white sitting the one at the head and the other at the feet where the body of jesus had lain amen she was interested she had a true heart a real interest where is my lord well maybe john and peter amen they were probably interested but not interested enough to see two angels but mary amen she stood there weeping amen she stood there because she was interested in where is my lord amen i wonder i wonder if we're that interested in the word of god amen brother branham said amen if if you're interested in god's word if you're talking about god if you want god on the scene if you want angels on the scene amen talk about the word talk about good things amen think on him think on these things as the scripture says praise the lord that's what mary was doing she was thinking and weeping amen when you're really thinking and and praying and meditating on god it's going to cause you to weep i just i i'm not sure i don't know if anybody a a person that's really praying amen in the spirit and and not weep i mean i i believe all of us have come to those those points in our lives where where you cry on unto god amen when when there when it's a real heartfelt prayer but if it's a now lead me down to sleep lord i pray the lord the key lord jesus protect us father god oh lord jesus bless us father god and you know it's kind of like a repetition amen there's no sincerity in that you expect angels to come on the scene don't expect angels to come on the scene don't expect his presence amen when there's not a whole sincerity about it praise the lord and they say unto her look what the what the angel said to her woman why weep us down she said she said unto them because they have taken away my lord and and i know not where they have laid him and when she had thus says she turned herself back and saw jesus standing and knew not that it was jesus now i wonder why she didn't know that it was jesus do you realize that when jesus resurrected amen he didn't resurrect the same way that he that he went that he died the bible says that he he he looked almost a man above 50 years old and he was only in age he was only 33. he was so worn out amen in his ministry that it really wore his body out and he looked older than what he looked like so when mary when mary turned around to see who it was that was talking to him she didn't know that it was him because he was all he was young again amen he resurrected in in in his young self amen and we have that promise saints do you think we're going to see brother ray gabriel and brother dick and and the saints that have gone from for in our family members do you think we're going to see them the same way they went i don't think so i don't expect to see my mother-in-law the same way that that we saw her go amen i expect her to see her young again amen i expect to see her amen in in in a new state amen in the way she i mean you can just kind of look at downstairs and that and the pictures we have sitting over there that kind of gives you an idea praise the lord it'll be better than a picture it'll be a reality amen i'm thankful for that amen because sometimes we forget it it seems like it's fairy tales to the world is fairy tales but it's not a fairy tale because the bible says so amen the bible tells us so and so and so mary thought that he was he was the gardener in verse in verse 14 and says and when she had thus said she turned herself back and saw jesus standing and knew not that it was jesus jesus said unto her woman why weepest thou whom seeketh thou she is opposing him to be the gardener saith unto him serve thou have borne him hands tell me where thou has laid him and i will take him away jesus said unto her mary amen she he called her name and it's something when jesus really calls your name amen you know that it's him calling you know when this god god calling amen praise the lord jesus jesus said unto mary she turned herself and saith unto him rabboni which is to say master jesus said unto her touch me not for i am not yet ascended to my father but go to my brethren and say unto them i ascend unto my father and your father and to my god and your god so he tells her to go and tell the disciples mary magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the lord and that he had spoken these things unto her amen now in verse 19 that was the first appearance that we see there after the lord jesus christ resurrection and it was to mary magdalene of course he appeared to the he he appears amen she was looking for him she was she was seeking amen and he only comes down if you're looking for him praise the lord but now look at verse 19 it says then the same day evening the same day that he appeared to mary in the evening time look what happens then the same day evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut i like the way the scriptures i mean it it gives detail it lets you know the doors were closed and they were shut amen they were they weren't half open amen they were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the jews the disciples were scared of the jews out there amen peter we know peter he even did not deny the lord amen he was scared even from then amen and so they were all crumpled in one room all scared amen and and sometimes that's how that's that's how we are amen after we have experienced some the greatest things i mean the lord jesus amen doing some wonderful things in our midst in the last 40 50 years amen and and now we're we're we're full of fear and and cramped amen and and not knowing what to do what what's next amen but god knows what's next and all he asked us was to look to his word look to his promises amen and they were assembled for fear of the jews and then look what happens came jesus and stood in the mist with the door shut in other words he appeared in front of them and saith unto them peace be unto you amen this is the first thing he tells them amen and that's what that's what i want to say to you saints amen peace be unto you amen you might be fearful you might you might not know what's going to happen amen but peace be unto you amen peace is what he has peace is what he is what he can give amen you may not understand everything amen you you might be fearful of of covet you might be fearful of what's going on around the world amen but peace be unto you amen do you you know that we are the people of peace amen that's why satan tries to rob our peace because we're the only true peacemakers in this world in this life amen there's no there's no peace between kings and and between israel in hamas and and and all that that all just goes away it dissipates amen but we are the true peacemakers amen because we have the peacemaker in us praise god praise the lord jesus not the pacemaker amen the peacemaker amen praise the lord we are the true peace and when he had so said jesus said he showed unto them his hands and his side so as soon as he said peace be unto you he gives him the sign amen he was interested in them knowing that that was him amen and i want you to understand tonight that he is interested in your problems he's interested in what you're going through he he's interested in in your situation amen and he gives signs and he gives amen his sign his daily sign amen as we'll look here in just a moment amen it's his word the message of the hour that he's given us in this day amen is constantly with us he is the word that's why he said i'll be with you even in you amen praise the lord blessed are those who who who have who have not seen but yet believed i've never seen a miracle in my life as far as seeing the dead rays or or or or somebody instant instantaneously healed i've experienced healing in my body i've seen healing in in other people's body amen but i believe that it can still happen he's the same yesterday today and forever amen and blessed are you amen who have not seen those things who have not really experienced amen great amen things that made you know but you still believe that's what he says here to thomas here in just a little bit amen then said jesus to them again peace be unto you i'm sorry let's go back to verse 20. and when he had so said he showed them he showed unto them his hands and his side then were the disciples glad when they saw the lord then said jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father hath sent me even so send i you amen and when he had said this he breathed on them and said unto them receive ye the holy ghost amen now that that that is not that they received the holy ghost right there and then that was a potential amen that was that was the promise amen and they had to go to jerusalem to actually receive that promise amen whosoever sins ye remit they are remitted unto them and whosoever sins ye retain they are retained now it's interesting that they say this that he says this to them before thomas came on the scene you know because thomas look what verse 24 says but thomas one of the twelve called didymus was not with them when jesus came when jesus was in that room thomas wasn't in there amen now some of us we criticize thomas we think i'm doubting thomas old doubting thomas you know because look look what the look what the verse 25 says the the other disciples therefore said unto him we have seen the lord they were excited because they had seen the lord but thomas went and ruined he was he was the one who uh what did they call when somebody comes in and ruins every you know just party pooper thomas was the party pooper he said look what he says but he said unto them except i shall see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and thrust my hand into his side i will not believe maybe he didn't say it with a british accent but i will not believe they were excited because they saw the lord and they saw a sign they knew it was him amen but thomas said if i don't see his the prince of the nails in his hands and if i don't put my finger in his side i'm not going to believe you know and sometimes we criticize thomas for that but thomas was the type of person that he wanted to know that he knew that he knew that he knew he didn't just want to be guessing and that's a good thing that's a good thing there's there's some people there's some of us amen that that that may not get it as quickly as some of us do amen some of us it takes some time like me hey man it takes me a little while you know you just kind of kind of work with me a little bit and maybe then i'll get it my wife could tell you that it takes me a while for me are you listening [Laughter] eventually i'll get it right sweetheart [Laughter] but thomas wanted to know for for a fact amen that the lord amen that they the disciples knew what they were talking about amen and so and after eight days look what verse 26 says and after eight days so thomas and the disciples they probably had their times during those eight days where like they were barely arguing with each other maybe i'm telling you guys we saw the lord i'm not going to believe it for eight days can you imagine for eight days it was eight days until the lord came back to thomas watch and after eight days again his disciples were within and thomas with them so they were back again hunkered amen in fear in the same room and and jesus christ amen was cared about what cared about thomas so much that he came back eight days later appeared unto them once again amen thomas with them then came jesus the doors being shut and stood in the midst and said peace be unto you didn't tell them anything different told them the exact same thing amen that's why you're saints amen we can't tell you us preachers we can't tell you anything different amen we can only tell you what the word says amen and the word says don't worry the word says don't fear the word says peace be unto you amen praise god trust in him who knows all things praise the lord i don't have all the answers amen they're not all preachers they have the answers god in the word has the answers amen then said he unto then said he to thomas look what jesus jesus now directly speaks to thomas and he says reach hither thy finger and behold my hands and reach hither thy hand and thrust it into my side and be not faithless but believing amen he went directly to the root of the issue right there amen he went straight to thomas and said i know this is what's going on so here and he he he he wasn't concerned about thomas's doubting and about his his what he maybe all the arguing that was taking place in all those eight days in between amen he went to go prove to thomas because thomas was one of his amen god is so mindful of each and every one of us amen he was so mindful of us even when we were out in the world that's why that's why brother brown says that it's god looking for you and not you looking for god amen jesus was looking for them amen because he knew that they were part of him they were one of his and he cared so much about thomas whether he was doubting or not amen that he was going to manifest and rev and let him know hey i am the lord jesus amen aren't you thankful that you serve a god like that praise the lord and verse 28 it says and thomas answered and said unto him my lord and my god amen that was all he needed and you know so so let us be patient with one another you know some some of us may not get it as quick as others jesus was patient patient enough to wait eight days i mean he was already living in eternity a glorified body at that time so eight days wasn't nothing it could have been just less less than a millisecond right to him where he was going through walls and things like that but it was eight days according to the scriptures time had passed amen and and he's mindful he's he's patient i'm thankful that we serve a patient god amen sometimes we we don't understand lord why why is it going this way what did we do wrong what what happened but but god is mindful and god god understands amen just just wait on him he's patient amen have faith in his word amen maybe it's not something you did maybe it's something that he's allowed for to happen so that you amen so it can change you and maybe know something about yourself that you didn't know otherwise amen that happens so many times especially if we have children when we have children we realize some things amen that's that's exactly like me i i act like that yeah you you say you talk that way you yeah so but the lord is mindful the lord is mindful he understands he understands and he he cares about you enough amen to keep letting you know coming back service after service amen and let you know i'm here i'm i'm the son of man amen and and you're destinated to reveal the son of man through your life amen so don't let these other things amen take a hold of you and and tear you down amen just keep believing my word keep believing my word jesus said unto him thomas because thou has seen me thou has believed blessed are they that have not seen and yet believed i love that scripture because i believe that's you and me amen i didn't see the miracles i wasn't living at that time i didn't live during the time that brother branham was here i didn't see those miracles sister cleda i believe you were in some of the services amen maybe some other people some others here saw those things i didn't see him i only heard his word amen the word of god that was enough for me to grab ahold of my heart amen but i believed him i believe the the the the signs i believe the wonders i believe that he steal jehovah rapha i believe that he's still jehovah's shaman jehovah jireh amen i believe that he's still the same yesterday today and forever praise the lord jesus because his word says so amen hallelujah and many other signs why in verse 30 and many many other signs truly did jesus in the presence of his disciples which are not written in this book and i want you i want you to take take a look at that because we're we're getting ready to go to chapter 21. and many other signs that jesus showed them after his resurrection keep that in mind but these are written verse 31 but these are written that ye might believe that jesus is the christ the son of god and that believing he might have life through his name all right now that was several appearances there we also know that he appeared to the two walking on the road to emmaus that's we can just leave that aside you most of us know what happened there now verse chapter 21 verse 1 after these things after jesus had appeared unto them in that room where they were fearful shut in because of fear of the jews jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the sea of tiberias now this was they were outside of the room maybe they got enough function i guess you could say gumption yes to go out now amen and on this wise showed he himself jesus showed he himself there were together simon peter and thomas called didymus and nathanael of cana in galilee and the sons of zebedee and two other of his disciples so they were all together and simon peter says unto them i go a fishing amen in other words i'm going back to my old lifestyle remember what had just happened in the screw in the previous chapter jesus had showed them many signs probably doesn't tell us how long he was with them in in the room both times that he came in the room but showed them many signs and now after the the excitement had drove had it had winged down oh i don't know he's just not coming back again i'm just gonna go back i'm gonna go back to my music i'm gonna go back to my lifestyle i'm gonna go back to the way things were amen reminiscing on the way things were back in the 80s and 90s and back in the 60s and 70s you know that's what peter i'm just going back fishing they say unto him we also go with thee i ain't got nothing else to do when they when they should be seeking and after many signs praise god are you still with me don't fall asleep amen we also go with thee they went forth and entered into a ship immediately and that night they caught nothing amen you're not going to get anywhere with god amen if you're if you're seeking after your own thing you're looking to do your own thing you're looking to to go back and and live your life amen you won't get anywhere with god amen they went and caught nothing because that's not what they were called for but when the morning was now come jesus stood on the shore but the disciples knew not that it was jesus then jesus said unto them children have you any meat they answered him no and he said unto them cast the net on the right side of the ship and ye shall find in other words if you cast it on the right side of the ship you're going to find fish they cast therefore and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes so it's almost like the lord saying let's see if they're going to do what happened when i first met them amen when he first came on the scene in their life amen amen and he told them cast the net amen and they did they obeyed and and they caught many fish verse seven therefore that disciple whom jesus loved said unto peter now just just do you all know when the bible says there therefore that disciple whom jesus loved do you know who that is if you don't know that's john because john is writing this but he he he's he's he's so uh he's very humble so he doesn't want to write he put his own name or he doesn't want to say you know that disciple that me the disciple who jesus loved you know he had humility amen therefore that disciple whom jesus loves saith unto peter it is the lord now when simon peter heard that it was the lord he gir his fishers coat unto him for he was naked and did cast himself into the sea amen praise the lord that's what happens when you go out and do your own thing lead you to nakedness you're naked before the lord you're naked before it's it's what it's what you know you go back to that lifestyle amen you go back to doing the things that that that you came out of amen the bible says seven more devils worse than what you had left well come in amen and peter and peter ger his fisher's coat amen he was naked he didn't want to be in the presence of the lord amen all naked amen he got out of the boat when he heard that it was the lord and he cast himself into the sea and put on his coat and the other disciples came in a little ship for they were not far from land but as it were 200 cubits dragging the net with fishes and as soon as they were come to the land they saw a fire of coals there and fish laid there on and bread now is interesting jesus told them go you know cast a net to the right and they pulled out a lot of fish but when they got to the bank there was jesus was already there with fish and bread cooked cooked fish and bread he was joined and i'm the creator i'm the lord jesus i'm the same one that made the fish and the the they fed the ten thousand right the five thousand the ten thousand i was there i'm that same one amen they got up there he told them go get fish and here he is at the bank he's there cooking fish amen and got bread because he spoke he wasn't fishing i believe he spoke it to existence and jesus said unto them bring of the fish which ye have now caught simon peter went up and drew the net to land full of great fishes and 153 and for and for all there were so many yet was not the net broken what incredible god that we serve the bible tells us there was a 153 fish exactly i mean it gives us those details like that that's what the lord said in the word amen he numbers the hair in your head he knows exactly how many hair some of us are a little bit easier for him than others [Laughter] amen but he knows brother brahma said you haven't lost one amen all the hair that you've lost amen that has gone down your your your drain sink amen the sink the drain god knows all about that hair and wherever is that right now it's waiting for you amen for you to come to it praise the lord jesus amen jesus said now verse 11 simon peter went up and drew the net to land full of great fishes and 153 for all there were so many yet was not the net broken jesus said unto them come and die amen that's what the lord tells us this evening amen come and die and he's already done all the work he's already did everything that needs to be done just come and dine feast on his word feast on his promises believe his promises just come unto me both those that are tired and heavy laden amen as brother bob has been speaking about lately and i will give you rest i got the answer i i got i got exactly what you need just come come and dine i think we all need to feed on his word more and more he's telling us amen come and die and spiritually we could use more time with the word amen we could use more time eating and feasting and none of the disciples durst asked him in other words they didn't dare to ask him who art thou because knowing that it was the lord they knew it was the lord how did they know him by the fish and the bread that was there amen jesus then cometh and taketh bread and giveth them and fish likewise this is now the third time that jesus showed himself to his disciples after that he was risen from the dead this is the third time so jesus was interested in letting them know i'm with you it's me peace amen be unto you now verse 15. so when they had dined jesus saith unto simon peter simon son of jonas love is down me more than these now i want you to look at the scene here for just a moment because jesus is about to ask him these three questions amen now when when peter was getting ready to deny the lord he was also around the fire warming his hands and here they are here's another scene where they're around the fire again and it was asked three times to peter peter you're one of them i've seen you and he denied the lord three times now he's given the he's the lord jesus is given the opportunity to make that right to let him know hey i've given you a chance you might have denied me three times you might have failed me amen but i'm giving you an opportunity not just one time two times three times amen the lord is a god of many chances saints amen don't think that that he's he's done with you amen if you failed him once amen just come to him and he has he's got the answer for amen he's willing to forgive you can't forgive your own sin you can't save your own self so why not put your trust in him amen why not have confidence in in him and what he's done and why do we celebrate amen easter because we're looking at what he's done for you now what you can do amen to get amen all the singing that you can do and all of that amen he's already taken care of all that the sin trouble for you so when they had dying jesus said unto simon peter simon son of jonas loveth thou mean more than these and he says unto him yea lord you know that i love you he saith unto him feed my lambs in other words he's getting them back to his this is what you're getting you're supposed to be doing this you're supposed to feed my sheep feed my lambs he says unto him again the second time simon son of jonas lovest thou me he saith unto him yea lord thou knowest that i love thee he says unto him now feed my sheep amen and then verse 17 he saith unto him the third time amen simon son of jonas loveth thou me and peter was now grieved in his heart because he said unto him the third time lovest thou me and he said unto him lord you know all things thou knowest that i love thee and jesus saith unto him feed my sheep amen peter as as jesus was asking him these questions peter knew that jesus meant business and what he was asking him amen and he's given him an opportunity amen to make that right around the fire just what he had you know what he had done there when he denied jesus but after that you know we don't hear about crow you know the crowing or anything like that amen jesus was right there with him praise the lord verily verily i say unto thee when thou was young thou girdest thyself and walk us wither thou wouldest but when thou shalt be old thou shalt stretch forth thy hands and another shall gird thee and carry thee whether thou wouldest not this spake verse 19 this bay key signify him by what death he should glorify god in other words he's telling he's telling peter he's telling him listen you denied me i know you denied me i know you denied me but you know what you're going to do it's going to come to a point where you're actually going to die for for me because the bible says there in verse 19 this spake he's signifying by what death he should glorify god peter was going to give himself so much amen that he was going to be willing to to die and the and the way the way peter died he was crucified as well but he but but according to history he was crucified upside down because he said i'm not even worthy to be crucified the way jesus up you know the way he was crucified he said put me upside down that's how much he was willing to die for the lord i'm not even worthy of even the way he died from denying jesus three times amen to to to dying for him though in that way amen but i believe this gave this gave peter assurance and verse 20 then and verse 19 it says and when he had spoken this he saith unto him follow me amen follow me then peter turning about see if the disciple whom jesus loved following in other words john john was following him which also leaned on his breast that supper and said lord which which is which is he that betrayeth thee in other words that was it it's going it's saying that that was that was john who was laying on on the on the lord's bosom on that night when they were taking communion and before before jesus was crucified peter seeing him said to saith to jesus lord and what shall this man do and jesus says unto him if if it will if it if i will that he tarry to like come what is that to thee follow thou me in other words peter was concerned about what what john was going to do and the lord tells him don't worry about john don't worry about anybody else don't worry about who's leaving the message don't worry about who's preaching what or what or what who said this or what hey man worry about yourself worry about your own salvation with fear and trembling amen is what jesus is telling him and i believe that's what the lord tries to tell us in this hour sometimes we're such busy bodies we want to know everything that other churches do we want to know everything that goes on amen and we don't worry about our own selves we know how many songs are sung in the air and in all the churches we know what songs what what's preached amen but we don't know we don't know our own selves we don't know where we are spiritually amen so what's that to you jesus jesus told him it sounds like he's being rude was that was that to you peter didn't i just tell you to follow me worry about that worry about following me amen i'll take care of the rest amen then when this saying you're brought among the brethren that that disciple should not die in other words that john was gonna die yet jesus said not unto him he shall not die but if i will that he tarry till i come what is that to you what is that to you amanda how does that affect you spiritually man you worry about your salvation with fear and trembling praise the lord maybe i struck a little nerve i guess just everybody i hear a pin drop amen because you know the more the the more that i go saints the less i want to know about people and about you know you you you don't want to get involved with everything that goes on and everybody's life you know it becomes a burden that's why you know i just you know it's been so nice i've been off facebook and on whatsapp and all that stuff for a while and it's just been wonderful i thought so i'm sorry if i haven't replied to some of your messages but it's just i'm kind of trying to live the way i was back in the 70s 80s and 90s where somebody called you at your house and if you weren't there oh well amen and it feels good i don't think the lord wants us to be burdened with so much notifications and all those things like that i'm just speaking from the heart you know we're just so burdened down and we're burdened down about notific with all these notifications and all these all these things that that oh i'm just going to check this one message and then 15 minutes later you're on facebook browsing videos how does that happen and i was i was there reading the bible oh a message came up brother wade just texted him over such and such but i i gotta check it amen you know if if it's if it's causing you to not walk with the lord if it's hindering your spiritual life maybe it's it's good to get away from it for a while you see if it's bothering if it's hindering you spiritually tick-tock and and all these things amen if it's hindering you spiritually you don't you don't need that in your life we didn't have it sister peggy you didn't have it in back in your in your time and you lit yeah uh what's up and she and she survived she's here you know the people in this world they want us to be merged in with these with these gadgets and these things they want you eventually they want you to be part of it not just you carrying the tablet or the phone they want you to be actually physically connected to it through a metaverse they call like that is going to be your life and so they've trained us for the last 20 years or so that you've got to have this technology you've got to have this in reality you don't in reality you don't it's good that we have technology we use technology it's great wonderful but if it's keeping you away from god maybe it's not the best thing in your life amen i'm telling you you know we work with technology brother joe and i we work with technology brother richard and the more we the more i mean to me it just gets more boring and more boring because i see where the world is trying to take us with all this technology and it's not good it's not good the these elites and these guys who have these plans for humanity amen it's not a good place where they where they're trying to take us with this but i believe god has taken their plans and used them for different purposes as well but if it's hindering you spiritually amen then maybe it's time to maybe take a fast it's okay your body needs fasts maybe we need technology fasts amen so that we don't know i don't need to know what everybody's doing amen in every church and every area amen that just it becomes overwhelming amen i just want to get closer to god amen in verse 24 this is the disciple which testified through these things and wrote these things and we know that his testimony is true and there are also many other things which jesus did the which if they should be written every one i suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written amen and a lot of those took place the 40 days after the resurrection and so of course you know we read there in in in acts chapter 1 we know that jesus ascends he tells them to go to the upper room and i will meet you there amen but i believe god was preparing them these these these 40 days right there preparing them so that they could go and not doubt amen they can go to that upper room to receive amen what the lord said that they were going to receive and i believe saints that in the last 50 years you know since the prophets left the scene you know you know maybe maybe we haven't seen much we haven't maybe experienced much uh maybe like the way the prophet was here on scene at that time you know we saw wonderful great things the lord appeared amen but i believe the lord is still here and he's here through his word amen and so blessed are you who have not seen but yet believe amen his appearance has taken place he appeared to the disciples many times but now it's time for you to just take those things and you run with them amen it's time for you to go to the upper room so so and receive his promise amen and and if someone here amen is not even sure if they're saved or if they're not born again amen tonight is your night that you can be amen if you don't even know amen i'm just coming to church and i don't even understand what those brothers out there are talking about amen you can know tonight amen one of us will be willing more than glad to spend time with you pray with you amen talk with you amen but you have to desire yourself you have to want it because god is a gentleman jesus christ is a gentleman amen he is he doesn't force any himself upon you amen so i just wanted to take take those thoughts and uh and and just kind of you look through them yourself the other things that took place and uh just thought it was interesting what the lord did there too in those last 40 days all right so i wanted to give you all an update on some of the things that uh the brothers could help me bring these uh pictures up i'm kind of scared to even scroll through these here because i thought that they were going to be in order but apparently they're they when i downloaded them uh they they got in in around the the times the months and the when when they came in and so they're they're ordered according to the date but we'll just start with this one uh last time when when i was given the presentation um brother nilsson but from nicaragua he's a pastor there and he had asked us if we could help them with uh with 300 for a roof um for this little church here in in an area called waspan in nicaragua so um when i got when we got back um we we sent him 300 and and so that that's the church without without the roof and he sent me some pictures again don't don't mind some of the things are here's some of the pictures there from the brothers in ohio oh my i lost anyways the church has put the roof is put up so we just thank god for that amen yes technology right let me just go to the actual and i just wanted to let you all know because you all were part of that hey man here's here's the the roof over their head now uh they put a you know 300 they were able to put a little metal roof so 300 goes a long way all right and uh here they are [Music] for your help with that praise the lord all right also um if you all remember the the the the young the young man who i showed a picture of uh it was in a hammock he was on a hammock he was he was a 40 year old something and he and he just and and the brother his dad wanted to make a little room for him so it'd be easier to kind of help with him so we gave him some money he had originally asked for 3 600 bucks to create make this room for him with with a bathroom and everything like that we gave him 1300 while we were there then we sent him um this is what the 1300 did he was able to have the room that's the brother right there that's brother cornelio and um and so if we fast forward here he's showing the room there and he's got a little hammock in there now so we just about a week or two ago we sent him another eight hundred dollars um and so to kind of finish put you know doors and windows and kind of finish the place up a little bit better he still i believe needs to have a little bathroom or something like that in there so um lord whalen he you pray for brother cornelio he's been very sick he's uh he bought the materials and uh but he's just been very sick and he hasn't been able to complete the little work there for his son so you just pray for brother cornelius the lord to touch his body he's uh he he has such a wonderful spirit and uh and he's praying for each one of us as well amen so he thanks he thanks each and every one of you for your prayers and then um let's see and then last here i wanted to some of you helped with this with this work but i just wanted to show you all this was this was a church in in honduras by the way the previous video i just showed you was in honduras this is also in honduras um they were praying to have the the building so when we left pretty much uh things looked like that right there alright so that they were just starting and but some of you uh some of this uh some of you helped out with this uh through the funds that you that you gave and um and so the brothers they started working on it and uh what we did with that money is we we we because brother paula fontaine's church is helping them build this church but what what our money did was that the brother that is dedicated his whole time building help him build this we help pay for help pay him so that he can just concentrate on because he has to work he has to raise a family so another he's going to be leaving he's going to leave in his work in order to to work on the church so he won't be getting paid at his home so what where we came in is we gave him some money to uh to take like two weeks to to to to build and so that's what we did and so that's how things looked before and then brother uh ellie brother ali who we are helping uh we are supporting um this is how the place looks now so what they did is if you can see right there on the on the on the left that was that's the church right there that that's that's the church where we where we married that couple and uh we and that so that's where it was at and so what they wanted to do is they wanted to to build right right on it and to make the sanctuary bigger and then also add some sunday school rooms and things like that as well and so uh this is where they were at just a few weeks ago and uh so i believe that they've i haven't gotten any updates from them but that's what the brother's been doing brother renee brother renee that's the work that they've been doing i want to ask you all to please pray for brother renee brother renee's brother renee the brother who's working on here his his brother he was working he was doing some work and uh he he he grabbed somehow or another he grabbed an electrical line and he's in pretty bad condition so you pray for brother renee's brother pray that the lord will touch him and he sent me a picture of him and he's in a uh he's in the unit where they have like burnt patients and stuff and they were not sure if he was gonna live or not he got electrocuted pretty badly so brother renee's taking it really hard because he lost the brother another brother of his a couple of years ago due to a motorcycle accident so he hates that he he thought that they were going to lose this other brother so remember him in prayer he's he's got a lot he's there trying to work helping finish the church and then you know his family there getting hurt so just remember him and the saints there in your prayers so i wanted to just show you all those updates and uh and just let you know that uh your money's still at work amen made sure that every penny and everything that you all donated went to the work of the lord and or to helping people amen physically amen and so i just appreciate the lord why don't we stand
