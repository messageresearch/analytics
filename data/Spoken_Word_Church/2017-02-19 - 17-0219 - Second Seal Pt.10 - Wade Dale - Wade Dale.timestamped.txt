[0:08] yes I started over here and asked a few
[0:10] of you have a good week Dan you have a
[0:12] good
[0:13] week better than I had last better in
[0:16] the head last week
[0:19] yeah so we have come to a point now to
[0:21] where we're going to wrap this steal up
[0:23] and go to the third seal if that's all
[0:24] right with you guys so let's read it one
[0:26] more time make a few more
[0:28] comments
[0:30] cuz we're going
[0:31] to actually we're going to revisit this
[0:35] seal in the six
[0:38] seal we're going to revisit this seal
[0:42] cuz this is the basis cuz
[0:46] remember something I want to bring out
[0:48] now may as well do it now so let's do it
[0:51] now can we see all right so you got one
[0:55] 2 3 4 5 6 seven all right you got seven
[1:02] CS
[1:03] right seven CS 1 2 3 4 5 6 seven all
[1:07] right if we break all that down and we
[1:09] know one thing for sure that brother R
[1:11] said the Raptor happens in 46 that right
[1:15] right this is the
[1:18] r
[1:20] okay so whatever it
[1:24] takes and you got to see this this is
[1:26] like the onion peel you can't just say
[1:28] well we got to go here and then we're
[1:29] going to keep continuing on cuz you have
[1:31] to drop back cuz there's a lap over
[1:33] there's a um and like brother Dale was
[1:36] going to talk about there's interval see
[1:37] there's an interval
[1:41] here yes there's an interval right there
[1:45] look in your Bible even when they they
[1:48] Revelation
[1:50] 61 gives us six seals right then it
[1:54] breaks to Revelation 7 which talks about
[1:57] the Jews coming in then Revelation 81 is
[2:02] the seventh seal so there's an there's a
[2:04] chapter interval then you got the
[2:06] trumpets that go through Revelations 9 1
[2:10] 2 3 4 5
[2:12] 6 Revelations 10 1-7 is injected in
[2:16] there and then Revelations 11 is the
[2:19] seventh trumpet so you got intervals
[2:21] then you got you got all your you got
[2:23] intervals between the sixth Church age
[2:24] and the seventh Church age right you got
[2:27] a gap there's a gap There's Always
[2:28] Somewhere you stop and PA
[2:30] all right so now we're in Seal number
[2:32] two so we showed that this one is what
[2:35] we're just going to say that's
[2:37] justification okay under the seals we
[2:40] see justification sanctification the
[2:42] baptism of the Holy Ghost and then
[2:44] brother R say what the
[2:46] word right cuz the word's got to be
[2:48] restored back the word's got to be back
[2:50] here in
[2:51] power and and you know four is not it's
[2:54] an Earthly number why because we get it
[2:56] all happens down here mhm there was four
[2:59] horse riders
[3:01] and there was four bugs in Joel but
[3:03] there was four that counteracted that
[3:06] which is justification sanctification
[3:07] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the word
[3:10] right all right which is The Headstone
[3:12] so The Headstone had to come back you
[3:13] say well what who are these
[3:16] two who are these three going to affect
[3:21] well obviously they're going to affect
[3:23] the Jews but remember the Jew starts all
[3:26] back and comes all the way back through
[3:27] here that horse rider goes all the way
[3:30] from apostasy in the in the first um
[3:35] three Church ages fourth Church age so
[3:38] this is 1 2 and three
[3:41] 4 5 6 and seven you got
[3:46] that got that M first three Church ages
[3:50] we showed a justification the first
[3:52] three Church ages 1 2 and three the word
[3:55] was brought in power and the
[3:58] lion
[4:01] ox man and then the eagle what the full
[4:05] word
[4:06] restore all
[4:08] right so there's your
[4:10] breakdown so truly the Rapture happens
[4:13] on the fourth seal and takes all the
[4:15] church ages out of here got
[4:18] it but what's 56 and 7 56 and 7 has the
[4:23] lap back over to
[4:28] here cuz who number seven
[4:31] MH Christ himself is the seventh seal
[4:33] you can't put him just coming to
[4:36] Israel he has to come to us to take us
[4:39] in Rapture right he has to come to us in
[4:42] this part that's why I want you to see
[4:44] the the types that we're showing here is
[4:47] something we can type down here like
[4:50] we're talking about upstairs with Jesus
[4:52] and I want yall to understand
[4:54] something I'm not just giving you
[4:56] stories of Jesus in in his life if the
[4:59] son of man Ministry is back here now in
[5:02] power then the same thing that Jesus is
[5:05] going through we're going to have to go
[5:06] through the same things that he spoke is
[5:08] what we're going to have to speak yeah
[5:10] it's not just good stories and talking
[5:12] about the
[5:13] Pharisees right right who's the
[5:15] Pharisees of the day the religious
[5:17] people of this time not back then but
[5:20] right now right CU those people are dead
[5:22] and gone we don't have to worry about
[5:25] Kus but we do have to worry about the
[5:27] spirit that anointed
[5:28] Kaa it's still here right it's not going
[5:31] to die to way back on over this way all
[5:34] right so we got to lap these back over
[5:36] so when I want you to see that's why the
[5:38] Rapture take place in the foreal why cuz
[5:40] this right here is this is all the Holy
[5:43] Ghost
[5:44] right
[5:47] right it's not that a lion is one Holy
[5:50] Ghost and the ox is another and the
[5:51] man's another no it's all the same
[5:54] character or different characteristics
[5:56] of one person when Jesus was here he f
[5:59] fulfilled all of them right I was
[6:02] thinking uh yesterday that you know
[6:03] Jesus was he was a prophet he was the
[6:05] prophet
[6:06] right what does the prophet do when he
[6:08] strikes the Earth he does three things
[6:11] he condemns the previous generation he
[6:13] brings a plague on the earth and then he
[6:15] brings his message Jesus did the same
[6:17] thing I'm going to talk to about this
[6:18] afternoon but you know where Jesus said
[6:20] I talked to it a little bit at the end
[6:22] of the sermon last week Jesus said I
[6:24] didn't come to bring peace and I'm going
[6:26] to read you another scripture where he
[6:27] says I come to divide
[6:30] right yeah yeah he come he didn't come
[6:32] to bring now what what is he talking
[6:33] about he's the Prince of Peace if we
[6:36] have the Prince of Peace inside of us
[6:39] that's why the letter kill it he was
[6:41] trying to tell those Pharisees that this
[6:44] is what the old I am what the Old
[6:46] Testament was all
[6:47] about I am the revelation of the Old
[6:50] Testament M yes and they turned him down
[6:53] so save same
[6:55] now and we'll read we'll read something
[6:58] to to show a real type about this age
[7:01] all right so for those of you that come
[7:04] in late we're talking about we're
[7:05] bringing the seals 1 2 3 4 5 6
[7:07] 7 we're we're on seal number two we're
[7:10] fixing get off event get on seal number
[7:11] three seal number one type justification
[7:15] seal number two sanctification three the
[7:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost and four is
[7:19] the word four is an Earthly number but
[7:22] four is not bad God has completed in
[7:25] three but then you have to bring the
[7:27] word in power
[7:30] onto that Holy Ghost to make it what the
[7:33] eagle anointing you got your lion first
[7:35] three ages Ox the fourth age which we
[7:38] were just talking about the third seal
[7:41] is the fifth and sixth Church age which
[7:43] is man which what you got in the fifth
[7:45] and six Church look at these two men now
[7:48] these were fine but the look Printing
[7:50] Press Printing the Bible uh bringing
[7:52] things together written word of God you
[7:55] bringing all this stuff the shrewdness
[7:56] of man with with Martin Luther and on
[7:59] Wesley right mhm but now watch the
[8:02] shrewdness of the devil has to come the
[8:04] same way that's right right which coming
[8:06] up on these justification sanctification
[8:08] baptism Holy Ghost and then the word all
[8:13] right so what we were talking
[8:16] about we go up on the fourth seal so we
[8:19] Rapture on the fourth
[8:21] seal cuz brother R said there's no more
[8:24] you you don't see any more combat beef
[8:28] that was his analogy that and the
[8:30] Revelation not an analogy that was a
[8:31] revelation that God giv him that there's
[8:34] no more holy ghost on the earth as far
[8:38] as a gentile age there's no more Gentile
[8:41] holy ghost on the earth when we take a
[8:44] Rapture it is only to the
[8:47] Jews no one will be saved except the
[8:50] Jews the 144,000 is the only people that
[8:53] will receive the Holy Ghost I'm sorry
[8:56] 144,000 and two let's be technical
[8:58] there's two prophets that's going to
[8:59] have the Holy Ghost to preach to them so
[9:02] that they can get the Holy Ghost all
[9:03] right but they're not responsible for
[9:07] this type of a
[9:10] Rapture they're not responsible for a
[9:12] body change right while we're alive cuz
[9:16] they're all going to be
[9:18] killed
[9:20] MH so they're not responsible with our
[9:23] responsibility is to take these right
[9:25] here and we're going to get but we're
[9:27] going to look I want you to see the
[9:28] higher order that we come up into 5 six
[9:31] and seven with an interval that's what
[9:35] that is right there that's that's a
[9:36] little
[9:38] interval CU like brother Dale talking
[9:40] you you read your Bible you look at even
[9:43] brother Brown preaching six Seals having
[9:44] questions and answers and then preaching
[9:47] seven the Bible Revelation 61 comes all
[9:50] the way down look at the very end it's
[9:54] just the six
[9:56] seals then you got Revelation 7 which
[9:59] has nothing to do with the seals itself
[10:01] after these things right all right then
[10:05] you got Revelations 81 when he had
[10:08] opened the seventh seal there's an
[10:09] interval even in the Bible between even
[10:12] in the um uh the trumpets 1 2 2 4 5 6
[10:16] then you bring Revelations 10 1 through
[10:18] 10 1 through whatever it is but we
[10:20] always go 10 1 7 but Revelations 10 you
[10:23] bring Revelations 10 in right here and
[10:26] then you bring that in and you look and
[10:28] see that
[10:30] the seventh trumpet is in the the next
[10:32] chapter there's an interval see the
[10:35] seventh seal had to become into an eight
[10:36] because it's still in seven but it is an
[10:39] eternal number because that's Jesus
[10:41] Christ all right yes I'll let D brother
[10:44] Dale explain a lot of that today and and
[10:47] next
[10:48] Sunday really some good things going to
[10:50] come out today y'all yall sleep this
[10:52] afternoon but you pay attention this
[10:55] morning I know you're going to do anyway
[10:57] so that's why I said that excellent
[11:02] huh I got permission yeah you got
[11:04] permission you don't know what I'm going
[11:06] to do while
[11:10] you're hope your mouth's not open right
[11:14] yeah yeah CU I get I'm going to get some
[11:16] in red hot from Susan it'll either choke
[11:19] you now what you need is those strips
[11:22] that you put on your tongue oh yeah I
[11:25] put it around a Tong they go to
[11:29] all right let's get back to this because
[11:32] we're getting into the third seal we're
[11:33] getting into a little more of an
[11:36] understanding and like I said the other
[11:38] day when I was speaking Sunday we all
[11:41] think that there's some
[11:44] great there is a great key but we all
[11:47] think that it's some some something that
[11:49] God's going to you know split the
[11:50] Eastern skies and come down and hand us
[11:52] a book another book or something else
[11:55] it's already written it's already been
[11:57] spoke all we have to do is is is dig out
[12:00] what's already there all right so we're
[12:03] not looking you know some people say
[12:04] wellow he that sermon was boring was it
[12:07] if it was boring to you then you need
[12:08] the Holy Ghost even though you may say
[12:11] well I don't understand all that there
[12:13] should have been one or two things that
[12:14] you get out of it listen people you're
[12:16] only going to get one or two things out
[12:17] of a sermon anyway right an hour and an
[12:21] hour and 15 or 20 minute sermon you
[12:23] might get listening that you can take
[12:25] and say back again 15 minutes right the
[12:29] rest of it is filler and background you
[12:32] just don't know this till your ministry
[12:33] it's filler and
[12:35] background right but you've got a 15
[12:39] minute Gap that you want everybody to
[12:40] listen to this but it may not be 15
[12:43] minutes in a row it may be 5 minutes
[12:44] here 5 minutes here 5 minutes here but
[12:46] there's something that you need to get
[12:48] same thing with these seals you think
[12:49] well this is boring we've already heard
[12:51] this before but something you going to
[12:53] have to tie together and you going to
[12:54] have to tie it together yourself cuz I
[12:56] can't tie it together for you but I'm
[12:59] want to try to make it more simple if
[13:01] the Rapture takes place on the fourth
[13:02] seal cuz we're going to start on the
[13:04] third seal we're going to read the
[13:05] second seal in just a few minutes and
[13:06] then we're going to read the third seal
[13:08] make a few comments and then come back
[13:09] next week but this is the way the setup
[13:12] is we've already come through
[13:14] justification and sanctification which
[13:16] this is not baby form justification this
[13:18] is not the justification when you got
[13:20] first born
[13:22] again okay mhm right right if you don't
[13:25] have that over if you don't have the
[13:27] Holy Ghost first you're not going to
[13:28] understand any of this if this is the
[13:31] greatest anointing that the prophet of
[13:33] God ever preached under quoting
[13:36] him then how you going to understand it
[13:38] without the Holy Ghost right problem is
[13:40] it's just like the
[13:42] Pharisees the Pharisees did the same
[13:45] thing with Ten
[13:47] Commandments yeah Pharisees did the same
[13:50] thing with Ten
[13:51] Commandments we got Moses's
[13:54] Commandments and we living by them and
[13:57] Jesus said they were dead
[14:00] why they took the
[14:02] letter that's why if you when when
[14:05] brother Brown said the rats would take
[14:06] place in the for seal the people were
[14:07] like well then 56 and 7 is not to us but
[14:10] we're going to prove that 56 and
[14:13] 7 has a lot to do with our body change
[14:18] yes so we have to lump it back in right
[14:20] here cuz this is where it all takes
[14:22] place if the Rapture takes place on the
[14:25] fourth seal then the body change has to
[14:28] take place
[14:30] underneath that for seal cuz we can't go
[14:33] on a Rapture without at least one person
[14:35] taking a body chain without death right
[14:38] right would you explain why the
[14:40] intervals are necessary what they're
[14:42] what they do it's a pause or a place to
[14:49] stop because if you'll read these seals
[14:51] 1 2 3 4 5
[14:53] 6 what does revelation 7 talk
[14:56] about a minute I'll show you
[15:35] [Music]
[15:45] [Music]
[15:59] are the seventh seal is always this is
[16:04] Christ right now what happens here is it
[16:07] brings it all to here for
[16:09] Gentiles cuz when we Rapture nothing but
[16:12] Jews will be
[16:13] saved after we leave here
[16:16] mhm so five is fifth seal Jew six is the
[16:20] two prophets and the seventh seal is
[16:22] Christ coming back to
[16:24] fight you'll see we're not going to read
[16:27] it right now but that seventh seal is
[16:29] what the calling out of the I'm sorry
[16:31] the interval is the calling out of the
[16:33] 144,000 what do the two prophets
[16:36] do call out 144,000 that's right all
[16:40] right then Christ comes on the
[16:46] earth just you you keep reading one of
[16:48] the elders what are these are raiding
[16:50] white Roes in other words he's telling
[16:52] you who it is then the first thing you
[16:55] come to Revelations 81 when you had open
[16:57] the seventh seal right then you're going
[17:00] to go into the trumpet so there was an
[17:01] interval there showing even Jesus when
[17:05] he
[17:06] preached he preached six seals in the
[17:08] Bible Matthew
[17:10] 24 we're getting way ahead of ourselves
[17:12] Matthew 24 he preaches and tells them
[17:15] about the six seal then what does he do
[17:17] he says parable of the feet
[17:20] tree same thing he's bringing Israel in
[17:23] he's showing Israel Israel has to be a
[17:25] part of these seals but not until we get
[17:28] out of here yes nothing is to Israel let
[17:33] hold
[17:34] on I'm trying not to be
[17:36] so because Israel as a nation will not
[17:41] be saved until we leave here Israelites
[17:45] or Jews can be saved right now under the
[17:47] baptism of the Holy Ghost and they can
[17:49] go into Rapture all right okay like that
[17:52] brother Solomon right what's his
[17:55] name no uhuh no the one that sent the
[17:57] message brother came
[17:59] Jacob Solomon Jacob see he's a message
[18:01] believer but he's a Jew and he's
[18:03] bringing Jews in now they're message
[18:05] Believers they're coming in here they're
[18:06] not going to they're not going to be
[18:08] here if if you if they get the Holy
[18:10] Ghost
[18:12] now cor their Nation a Jew is a still a
[18:16] nation but God separated them but
[18:20] um and I may read it no I won't read it
[18:24] this Sunday it shows the Jews will be
[18:27] scattered there scattered into all
[18:30] nations so why are they scattered into
[18:32] all nations so they become a nationality
[18:34] but what happened several years ago God
[18:36] said return back because I've got
[18:42] 144,000 that's got to be back here to
[18:45] listen to that message of two prophets
[18:47] be saved filled with the Holy Ghost die
[18:51] and then they take a Rapture right
[18:56] then the rest of the Danel 70 weeks can
[18:58] be fulfilled you got all your atomic war
[19:01] you've got your Jews coming back in the
[19:02] Millennium or in the this post
[19:04] Millennium or premillennium to build the
[19:08] temple and then we come in at the very
[19:10] end to anoint the temple that's way on
[19:11] down the road
[19:13] so at all times that's why brother said
[19:15] if you don't get the Daniel 7 weeks
[19:17] you're not going to understand how this
[19:18] works right and that's the truth you're
[19:20] not going to understand how this works
[19:22] cuz if if Danel 70 weeks ends right here
[19:25] then the Millennium must take place
[19:26] right there right right and it can't mhm
[19:30] they they got to build a millennium
[19:31] Temple the 144,000 got to come back so
[19:33] there's
[19:35] time that's what I was telling y' all
[19:36] the other day we look at that date 2026
[19:40] and brother Dale says we can go we are
[19:41] going to go past 2026 yeah yeah right
[19:45] okay if 2026 ends Daniel 70 week then in
[19:51] 3026 we're going to the white Throne
[19:54] judgment because this is time the
[19:57] Millennium is time we're going to have
[19:58] days nights mhm months which are all
[20:02] going to go back to 360 but we're going
[20:04] to have cuz that 1,000 years is not 365
[20:10] and4th it's really it's really
[20:12] interesting because brother R was
[20:13] talking about Atomic something may have
[20:15] blew up before the flood to make the
[20:18] Earth shift well this is going to be an
[20:21] atomic battle again and what if it sets
[20:23] it right back up it's going to have to
[20:25] because that put us back to 360 days of
[20:28] the year so we're we're going to live a
[20:31] thousand years in time right brother D's
[20:34] going to cover that this week and and
[20:36] probably next week because there's some
[20:38] things that's got to go on in the
[20:39] Millennium that we're just now getting a
[20:41] revelation of that is not part of the
[20:43] future home but yet you can mold some of
[20:45] them together cuz brother Brown somebody
[20:47] asked him said can babies be born in the
[20:49] Millennium he said I can see where they
[20:50] can I can see where they
[20:52] can mhm but now in the future home no
[20:56] right in the future in the Millennium
[20:58] this going to be demons that are going
[20:59] to be but they're going to be bound but
[21:01] they're still going to be there and
[21:02] they're going to be loosed at the Battle
[21:04] of go and Magog but now that future home
[21:06] is what it's an
[21:08] eight see we're we're going to be in a
[21:10] seven all the way till the day of the
[21:11] white Throne judgment right
[21:14] right the seventh day yes I hope y'all
[21:18] caught that last Sunday where brother
[21:20] Dale was preaching you you got six days
[21:24] of
[21:25] creation right and bobin was talking and
[21:29] and Louise the other night at the
[21:31] banquet you got six days of creation
[21:33] well Man was created here and then what
[21:35] did God say he said I'm going to rest on
[21:37] the seventh day now man fell right in
[21:40] the first part of that seventh day right
[21:44] right so you want to talk about an
[21:45] interval there's an interval between the
[21:47] 6 and the 7 right what's the
[21:51] interval that's
[21:55] right 6,000 years of
[21:57] time
[21:59] cuz the seven the seventh the seventh
[22:01] day is the
[22:04] Millennium God said the day you eat
[22:08] thereof that day you'll die so they fell
[22:10] in that seventh day but God had to bring
[22:12] time as an
[22:14] interval 6,000 years of
[22:17] time and then after that 6,000 years of
[22:20] time Brother D proved it just the other
[22:22] day we're in year 57 something we're not
[22:23] even at that yet but we're getting there
[22:26] but that's seven that's not a day
[22:29] like a 24-hour day that's a rest for the
[22:33] people yes right we got our rest here
[22:35] listen everything that's spoke of in the
[22:37] Bible I want you to realize the bride
[22:40] gets it here yes right other things have
[22:43] to happen because of this other things
[22:44] have to happen because of this because
[22:46] of the seals because of this but we get
[22:48] every bit of this our Eighth Day comes
[22:52] right here
[22:54] right your Soul's in the Eighth Day
[22:57] right now yeah mhm we just got to wait
[23:00] for the Redemption of the body to bring
[23:02] it into the eth day because in the eth
[23:04] day all all
[23:08] bodies will be
[23:10] glorified
[23:12] yes but not in a seven cuz remember
[23:15] somebody a heathen has got to live a
[23:17] thousand years of Earthly time to prove
[23:21] that the sin curses over now it's not me
[23:24] and you the bride doesn't cuz we're
[23:25] Eternal right here right the 140
[24:02] [Music]
[24:28] it was built on your
[24:31] desire yeah right it was built by your
[24:33] desire read the future home brother D
[24:35] said read read the future home he said
[24:36] he makes that with the desire the
[24:38] bride's desire is what he builds that
[24:40] future home on cuz remember he types it
[24:43] he said why would a man not want to
[24:44] build something for his wife yes that
[24:46] she will enjoy all right right all right
[24:50] so everybody got that so far clear as
[24:54] mud kind of a lot of drawing here but
[24:57] but that's what I want because when we
[24:58] go into three and four we're not going
[25:00] to background much we just going to kind
[25:02] of keep going all
[25:04] right but that interval to me is is to
[25:07] catch everything
[25:09] up catch everything up get everything
[25:11] settled in your mind bring a group of
[25:14] people in and then we all go right and
[25:18] that means in Revelation also cuz cuz
[25:21] brother Dale's had this Revelation for a
[25:23] long time it's just taking a long time
[25:24] for us to catch up with it m okay so so
[25:27] hopefully we're we're catching up cuz if
[25:30] not you're either going to catch up or
[25:31] you're going to or you going to you're
[25:33] going to be you going to be here out
[25:34] through here you going to be here
[25:39] yeah all right so everybody got that so
[25:42] far Raptor happens on the for
[25:45] SE get rid of that need that
[25:53] anymore that's why I said we was talking
[25:55] the other day that's why that to me that
[25:58] there was no Dimension that genesis6 man
[26:00] was not was not formed in in a dimension
[26:05] that genesis6 man is an eternal man he
[26:07] was formed in eternity or brought forth
[26:10] in eternity all right so that was not in
[26:14] time but when man
[26:16] fell in the seventh day rest God said
[26:19] hold on you can't live a thousand years
[26:21] I'm going to withdraw that th
[26:23] years but we're going to have 6,000
[26:25] years of time first three Dimensions the
[26:29] three dimensions that's in time is first
[26:31] three life like matter all right
[26:35] okay and that's where man fell man fell
[26:39] when God put him in Flesh on the earth
[26:41] then he put a division I'll put enmity
[26:43] what's enmity imity is a division we're
[26:46] going to read it today where Lazarus
[26:48] went to hell I mean sorry Lazarus went
[26:50] to heaven and Rich ruler went to hell he
[26:52] said I can't come to you and you can't
[26:54] come to me cuz there's a great Gul fix
[26:56] what there's a dimension there's a
[26:57] divide that you can't go across now this
[27:00] man right here can mhm right all power
[27:04] in heaven and earth been given unto me
[27:05] he can go travel through any Dimension
[27:06] he wanted to all right and he can
[27:09] because of that glorified body and
[27:10] that's the problem that we have we can't
[27:13] get through this because this is in time
[27:17] that's right this matter Life Light and
[27:19] matter that's matter that's that's
[27:21] something
[27:22] solid but if you come over into the
[27:24] dimension with Christ that means nothing
[27:26] mhm that's not even a a barrier amen cuz
[27:30] he walked through concrete cuz that's
[27:32] what they made their buildings out of
[27:33] back then and he walked right through
[27:34] the wall the Bible says so so that's
[27:39] what we're coming to people on Earth not
[27:42] in heaven on Earth what we're coming to
[27:44] but we got to get these seals and show
[27:46] that they were not just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
[27:49] brother Brian preached them and he left
[27:51] and then we're just here to no we got to
[27:53] we got to see when we see these things
[27:56] coming the Bible says when you see these
[27:58] things approaching look up for your
[28:01] Redemption draw now so when we see these
[28:04] things coming when we see that that the
[28:07] Holy Ghost is not totally in power
[28:10] yet we don't let it be in power yet okay
[28:14] I I don't the Holy Ghost has never been
[28:16] has never been uh um where he couldn't
[28:20] do whatever he wanted to but the prophet
[28:22] of God said the Holy Ghost has been
[28:23] bound for 2,000 years at the door of
[28:26] creed and Dogman so our cre and dogmas
[28:29] is what binds the Holy Ghost yeah cuz
[28:32] remember I love what the prophet of God
[28:34] said this helped me more than anything
[28:35] brother said the Holy Ghost is a
[28:37] gentleman that's why he stands at the
[28:39] door and knocks he doesn't just if it
[28:41] was me or
[28:42] you to save our children we'd bust the
[28:44] door down and go in and save them right
[28:47] God goes it's your choice I'm not coming
[28:50] in unless you want me in even brother
[28:52] Bri preached doors and doors he said
[28:53] even when you get the Holy Ghost he
[28:55] walks into your house and yet there's a
[28:57] closet door closed or door closed over
[29:00] here that you won't let Pride he calls
[29:02] them Pride this he gives all different
[29:05] meanings of the things we don't let him
[29:07] in that's where this comes
[29:12] in amen that's where this comes in
[29:15] there's your
[29:16] doors yes there's the doors that you
[29:19] won't let him
[29:20] in
[29:22] right that's why that's very important
[29:26] after you're born again that's very
[29:27] important
[29:29] cuz brother R said a lot of people have
[29:30] these traits or characteristics and not
[29:32] even warning him but if you let him in
[29:34] your house and let him do his work then
[29:38] what's he going to do he's going to seal
[29:39] it with the Holy Spirit or the Holy
[29:42] Ghost then he's going to bring the word
[29:44] that's why you see here 1 2 3 lonox man
[29:47] and Eagle Lono man an eagle then what's
[29:50] going to happen The Headstone going to
[29:52] come and we're going to take out of here
[29:54] cuz who's The
[29:55] Headstone Christ he's the headstone
[29:58] he told us he was he I'll read it today
[30:01] he told them who he was he said you've
[30:03] rejected The Headstone and now I've
[30:05] become the corner in other word
[30:08] right the Chief
[30:11] Cornerstone so that's just an overview
[30:13] and I'm going to leave that up there if
[30:15] you want to look at it a little more
[30:20] but 1 2 3 4 this is this is our time but
[30:24] 56 and 7 has to lap back over and help
[30:27] us take a body change everybody
[30:30] understand we got to take a body change
[30:32] and it's got to be something that no one
[30:33] else has done except Jesus Christ
[30:34] himself why do you take a body
[30:37] change he was he was number
[30:40] seven he was the seventh seal made
[30:43] manifest the Seal of the tomb was broke
[30:46] and he says all power in heaven Earth
[30:48] been given unto me so Christ is the
[30:50] seventh
[30:51] seal and sure he comes to you at the
[30:53] Holy Ghost but it's in a baby form it's
[30:55] in a form just like the 3,000 downstairs
[30:58] on the day of Pentecost all right so
[31:00] these seals are not
[31:02] just something that we read through
[31:04] there's a meaning behind every one of
[31:06] them everybody all right with that do
[31:08] you do you at least say you see this
[31:12] whether you understand it or not just
[31:13] say okay I see how we go to four the r
[31:15] take place cuz 5 six and seven to me are
[31:21] are super important we're not going to
[31:24] be here when they actually break but
[31:26] they got to break to us before
[31:28] we take a Rapture so you got to lap them
[31:31] back over remember all you Church agents
[31:33] what they do they lap
[31:34] over why because there's a place right
[31:37] in
[31:38] here that remember what we were talking
[31:40] on on the search agents there's a porter
[31:42] that walks out and
[31:44] introduces right so what brother brand
[31:46] do at the end time he didn't introduce
[31:49] another church AIDS he didn't introduce
[31:50] another church AIDS Messenger right he
[31:52] introduced the seventh seal yes he
[31:55] introduced Christ right the son of man
[32:58] K red
[33:01] blood killing mhm all right so that's
[33:04] the same thing with you and I to me cuz
[33:07] see look justification does not kill the
[33:09] unclean
[33:11] Spirit I'm let's go back to baby form
[33:14] justification baby form justification
[33:16] only chops off your past
[33:19] sin all right you continue the person
[33:22] that made you do that is still there now
[33:24] this afternoon we're going to read where
[33:26] Jesus is talking about the unclean
[33:27] spirit what goes
[33:29] out right a word to clean you up the
[33:33] unclean Spirit goes out of a man Seth
[33:36] rest walk in dry places seek rest find
[33:38] us none comes back and if you don't put
[33:40] something in there like the the analysis
[33:43] of the of the cup you find this cup it's
[33:45] all dirty you can clean it up you can
[33:48] put it in the dishwasher but if you set
[33:49] it right back out into the yard where
[33:52] you found it it's going to get dirty
[33:54] again cuz it's not sealed mhm right
[33:58] but if you'll fill it up with something
[34:00] and then seal
[34:02] it the Holy Ghost if you'll put
[34:04] something in seal it it won't get dirty
[34:06] on the inside now the outside can get
[34:08] dirty that's this guy yeah that's where
[34:11] you got to work on this but inside it's
[34:16] clean so there was
[34:18] a second seal hang on let's read it
[34:21] around here power was given unto him to
[34:23] take peace from the earth that they
[34:25] should kill one another and there was
[34:26] given to him a great sword now what what
[34:27] was that great sword we said the great
[34:30] sword that Satan was given was one word
[34:32] off go back to the Garden the reason we
[34:35] had to be put in time was one word
[34:39] not one word got us out of the garden
[34:41] that's why brother Brown said one word
[34:43] off not going to get us back in the
[34:44] garden
[34:46] okay so but we have a word if you'll
[34:50] take the right word it'll clean you up
[34:52] if
[34:53] not it's going to cut it's going to kill
[34:56] you that's why I said sanctification is
[34:59] one of the worst places to stay in it's
[35:01] not not a bad place to be it's one of
[35:04] the worst places to stay that way cuz
[35:06] the Pharisees that's where they were
[35:09] we're clean we're holy we do what the we
[35:12] do what the the Torah says we do what
[35:14] Moses Abraham's Our Father remember he
[35:17] they kept telling Jesus Abraham's Our
[35:18] Father we do what Moses said who are you
[35:21] you're in here and you're tearing
[35:22] everything up but he said if You' have
[35:25] known Abraham you'd have known me
[35:28] if you have known Moses You' have known
[35:31] me so what did they know Moses and
[35:32] Abraham by letter right do this don't do
[35:36] that do this don't do that yes brother
[35:39] brandham
[35:43] said cuz all you major doctrines in the
[35:46] message they going to go back to brother
[35:47] brand said true that's why I've always
[35:49] said they stood up and they said we have
[35:51] Moses's quotebook and they did
[35:54] everything Moses quoted the Torah was
[35:55] everything Moses wrote first five books
[35:57] of the Bible
[35:58] that's what they based everything on
[36:00] right yes all right same way with the
[36:03] message you pick pick a message book up
[36:05] and say we're saying what the prophet
[36:08] said are you are you they never
[36:12] understood Jesus he and I'll read it
[36:14] this afternoon they didn't understand
[36:15] Jesus so they never understood the other
[36:17] prophets and he said you killed
[36:19] them the own religious World killed the
[36:22] prophets in the Old
[36:24] Testament Isaiah was a young boy but he
[36:27] they saw him up in pieces yeah because
[36:30] of what he believed because of what they
[36:31] said he was a lunatic or a heretic or
[36:33] whatever Isaiah was was one of the
[36:37] greatest prophets ever lived really
[36:39] didn't look what they did to John the
[36:41] Baptist they took John the Baptist and
[36:43] cut his head off so and Jesus told him
[36:47] he said you know they said can you drink
[36:49] of this cup and they said we can he said
[36:51] yes you can said but this is what you're
[36:52] going to go through they're going to
[36:54] take you before Kings they're going to
[36:55] kill you we'll read that this afternoon
[36:57] so that's what exactly what's going to
[36:59] happen in this age if we have the son of
[37:01] man Ministry back here then I'm not just
[37:03] telling y'all stories up there Sunday
[37:05] afternoon you got to bring it to here
[37:07] right right you got to bring it to here
[37:10] right you got to see well aha I know why
[37:13] that happens because of and you got to
[37:16] look back and see what happened in the
[37:18] Pharisees because Jesus Jesus told us
[37:20] everything we needed to know yes if not
[37:24] he's got to come back and tell us
[37:25] something different you hear what I said
[37:28] different but he's not he preached the
[37:30] seals already told us what was going to
[37:32] happen told us the Gent I mean the Jews
[37:34] were coming in the Fig Tree is always
[37:37] the Jews the Fig Tree The Olive Tree and
[37:40] all these things coming in then the Wild
[37:42] Olive Branch is going to be put in which
[37:44] is us all right that space of time in
[37:47] there so these seals are are truly the
[37:50] most
[37:51] important part of this message but if
[37:53] you don't get all the other Foundation
[37:57] it's just going to be you know you're
[37:59] looking for something to happen after
[38:00] the second seal you go well what's going
[38:02] to
[38:04] happen you got to make it
[38:06] happen I can't make it happen I know
[38:09] what I'm looking at you got to know what
[38:11] you're looking
[38:12] at like brother Dale he's he's it sounds
[38:15] smart out it to people but he's the only
[38:17] one that knows he's
[38:19] right we may have a problem or question
[38:22] about whether he's right or not but you
[38:24] better know that you're right somebody
[38:26] better know that they're right I would
[38:27] rather have that and somebody going up
[38:28] there and preach 40 years and go I don't
[38:30] know if this is right or not but we're
[38:33] going to preach this
[38:34] today come on
[38:37] baby but you got to know if you're right
[38:39] or not you'll know if he's right if
[38:41] you're right right let me say that again
[38:44] you'll know if he's right if you're
[38:46] right you'll know if I'm right if you're
[38:49] right right I
[38:51] uh I heard something the other day and
[38:54] it was really profound and I'll tell you
[38:56] this and we ain't getting no where we
[38:58] start next
[38:59] Sunday like we always
[39:01] do a guy said he was talking about
[39:04] looking for a partner looking for a mate
[39:07] he said how you going to find the
[39:09] Perfect
[39:10] Mate how do you find the Perfect Mate
[39:13] how's the the perfect way to find a
[39:16] Perfect
[39:17] Mate you make yourself one first that's
[39:21] it that's true you make yourself a
[39:24] perfect
[39:25] mate and then whatever ever is out there
[39:28] will come drawn to that and I thought
[39:30] that is so profound and he's not even in
[39:31] the message that's awesome but that's
[39:34] profound same thing with God same thing
[39:36] with with your Christian walk if you
[39:38] want Christ to live in your life if you
[39:40] want Christ to reveal these things to
[39:42] you act like him that's act like him cuz
[39:46] he's your partner right he's your mate
[39:48] yeah if you going to looking for a mate
[39:51] be the be the Perfect Mate to start with
[39:53] you be the Perfect Mate and then
[39:55] whatever's out there I'll come to you
[39:56] same thing with the Revelation that's I
[39:57] talking about that I was reading and I
[39:59] thought man that is so
[40:01] profound that if we cuz brother R said
[40:04] we become the word as we what eat the
[40:06] word as we take the word in to make
[40:09] yourself available for the word if you
[40:11] don't make yourself available then he
[40:13] he's like I said holy ghost is a
[40:14] gentleman if you don't want to study
[40:17] okay don't but you're not going to get
[40:19] this right if you study you'll get
[40:22] this steady Show Yourself approved right
[40:25] right right so that's kind of profound
[40:27] make yourself a Perfect Mate you want to
[40:29] look for a Perfect Mate make yourself
[40:30] one good that's pretty good that is very
[40:33] that's good if I didn't say it myself
[40:35] yes but that man was like I said he
[40:37] wasn't a message believer he was just a
[40:39] like a theologian on the radio and he
[40:41] was said that just hit me right you know
[40:43] one of the things that hits you right
[40:44] between eyes you go man that's exactly
[40:46] right even in your Christian walk make
[40:48] yourself a perfect mate for God to come
[40:51] to yes cuz remember we got to be a
[40:54] perfect bride he's not going to touch a
[40:56] bride that's not a virgin right right
[40:58] right he's not he's not going to marry
[41:00] prostitute right he put them away
[41:02] because they were prostitute he's not
[41:04] going to forget
[41:07] them but if you prostitute yourself to
[41:09] the world or whatever you understand
[41:10] what I'm saying not not
[41:13] literally but to all the things of the
[41:15] world then God's not obligated to give
[41:17] you anything he's standing
