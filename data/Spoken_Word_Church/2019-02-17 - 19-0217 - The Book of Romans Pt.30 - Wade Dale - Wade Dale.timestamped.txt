[3:16] absolutely Twila the whole the kids to
[3:17] church of christ will achieve Churches
[3:19] of Christ with you now beseech you
[3:20] brethren mark them which cause division
[3:23] and offences contrary to the doctrine
[3:26] which you have learned and avoid them if
[3:29] I got that what an arrhenius day when
[3:34] serene theist was in the same bath
[3:35] houses within remember he runs out of
[3:37] the bathhouse and said I don't want to
[3:38] be caught in in the same room with that
[3:41] infidel or that well and all him and not
[3:44] say all but when he was preaching was
[3:46] which Christ wasn't God he was a like a
[3:48] demon God or a sang a person or or he
[3:51] was became died at the River Jordan
[3:54] we've heard those doctors before they're
[3:55] not new they're all just dug up from
[3:57] them yeah so the demons don't die the
[3:59] day remember demons just keep traveling
[4:01] they travel through dimensions and they
[4:04] didn't they traveled in that dimension
[4:05] and what happened was somebody opened
[4:08] their self up for that doctrine I say
[4:11] whether the Trinity you think God ever
[4:13] brought a Trinity into the end of being
[4:14] no the devil brought the Trinity into a
[4:18] being but as man accepted it
[4:20] I went to take nurse of man because they
[4:22] didn't have teaching like we have now
[4:24] and they had gotten away from the first
[4:26] love as the first church they said
[4:28] because the first church age remember
[4:30] had no second person of Christ they had
[4:32] no Jesus wasn't God to the River Jordan
[4:35] they held Baptist Methodist and
[4:38] Pentecostal and all these different
[4:39] doctrines they only have one doctrine
[4:41] and that was the doctrine of the
[4:43] classroom yes and Paul you know said in
[4:46] his character before the gospel which I
[4:47] preached mark them
[4:53] or know them which cause divisions and
[4:57] offenses contrary to the doctrine which
[4:59] you've learned and avoid them for they
[5:02] are such serve not our Lord Jesus gospel
[5:05] now obviously they're preachers because
[5:09] they're preaching a doctrine ya know not
[5:12] uh not an evil to say what I mean by
[5:15] evil they're trying to preach I guess
[5:19] what they see but they're trying to fill
[5:21] their own bellies and my good words and
[5:24] fair speeches deceive the hearts of the
[5:26] simple we know that that term that goes
[5:30] on all the time innocent for your
[5:36] obedience is come abroad unto all men
[5:39] now not obedience to Paul remember we
[5:45] know don't give them obedience to
[5:47] program we have obedience to God Paul
[5:50] was a servant from the ground with
[5:52] servant so we include them in that but
[5:54] his obedience here is saying I'm glad
[5:58] you're obedient to the word I'm glad
[6:01] you're obedient to what we're preaching
[6:02] I am glad that for on your behalf
[6:06] but yeah when have you wait lies unto
[6:09] that which is good and simple concerning
[6:11] evil all right and the daughter peace
[6:14] shall bruise Satan under your feet under
[6:16] your feet so the bride is where we'll go
[6:20] back to genesis 3:15 remember Satan's
[6:25] gonna bruise his heel we're gonna bruise
[6:29] his hand so we're gonna
[6:31] vice versa but look you tell this right
[6:34] here shortly
[6:37] we know one thing for sure Paul no
[6:39] remember what we're talking about polish
[6:41] prophesy he's telling a group of people
[6:44] but you and I are gonna have to become
[6:46] that and the God of peace shall bruise
[6:49] Satan under your feet period yes period
[6:53] now shortly
[6:54] there's no shortly no more this is it
[6:56] period okay and the God of peace shall
[6:59] bruise Satan under your feet shortly the
[7:01] grace of our Lord Jesus Christ to be
[7:03] with you
[7:03] amen Timothy's my work fellow and lucius
[7:09] and jason and soap
[7:11] painter my kinsmen salute you I turn us
[7:15] who wrote this epistle to limit you in
[7:17] the Lord
[7:18] courteous you didn't know Paul's name
[7:20] with 30 opinion he wrote this official
[7:24] guys month host and of the whole church
[7:27] salute saluted you erastus the
[7:30] chamberlain of the city
[7:31] salute jim Quartus my brother the grace
[7:34] of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all
[7:36] amen now to him that is the power to
[7:39] establish you according to my gospel and
[7:42] the preaching of Jesus Christ according
[7:44] to the revelation of the mystery which
[7:46] was kept secret since the world began
[7:48] but now is made manifest and by the
[7:50] scriptures of the prophets now he's
[7:52] talking about the Old Testament he's
[7:55] healing the Prophet is talking in the
[7:57] New Testament right now they haven't
[7:58] been a property to rock the Bible and
[8:01] writing the Bible according to the
[8:03] commandment of the everlasting God made
[8:05] known to all nations for the obedience
[8:07] of faith to God only wise be glory
[8:10] through Jesus Christ forever amen but
[8:14] Paul is finished with this writing to
[8:16] the Romans and the book of Romans to me
[8:20] is it's a powerful book it tells us how
[8:24] to live I do how to work we went through
[8:27] all the adoption part of it wrong
[8:30] Romans 8 there's therefore now no
[8:33] condemnation
[8:34] wooden cross to use he won't have to
[8:36] play and then he ends up his he ends up
[8:40] his whole chapter of the book of Romans
[8:42] saluting the people that are with him in
[8:45] other words face picking them up then
[8:48] hey I may be going to Rome but all these
[8:50] people here you need to you need to
[8:51] listen to them because they have my
[8:53] gospel right and that's what Paul's told
[8:57] to me like brother Browns that Paul
[8:59] didn't going to a nation or into a
[9:01] country and stay there for months he
[9:04] would stay there and establish one
[9:05] person get them established and then he
[9:08] would move on there's no reason for me
[9:10] to go to the Philippines and spend three
[9:12] months I'm not a Filipino but we're
[9:16] going to go over there bring the
[9:18] preachers together establish them in the
[9:20] gospel a little bit more I'm gonna get
[9:22] out of there come back here home where
[9:23] I'm supposed to be and then you know
[9:25] what what better than preaching every
[9:27] Wednesday every Sunday every wins he
[9:29] ever Sunday every Wednesday it was
[9:30] Sunday every wins the other Sunday
[9:32] because God can speak to them just as
[9:34] well as he speaks to us there is no
[9:36] difference because we're Americans and
[9:39] because we're in Lula there's no
[9:40] difference doc can speak to them but
[9:46] that guy hear it first so you present
[9:48] the gospel to them that's what Paul's
[9:50] doing he goes out presents the gospel
[9:51] and I don't know I believe Paul made
[9:54] being preaching to a bunch of people and
[9:55] all of a sudden the Lord show him or he
[9:58] sees an interest in just one or two not
[10:00] five hundred just one or two people and
[10:03] I believe Paul would being them the
[10:05] master he is he would go to that person
[10:08] and establish him you know what that's
[10:11] the Lord leading you to do that right
[10:13] leading you to strengthen how you going
[10:15] to strengthen the brother that doesn't
[10:17] want to be strengthened see you just
[10:18] wasting your time right that's why you
[10:20] say it move on don't even be caught with
[10:23] them what do you say what was that
[10:31] mark 10 which caused the vision and
[10:34] offenses contrary to the doctrine which
[10:36] ye have heard and avoid them all right
[10:42] it didn't say shun I'm gonna throw them
[10:44] in you know going in ditch he just said
[10:47] avoid them in other words Paul says I'm
[10:50] not gonna spend a lot of time on
[10:52] somebody that don't want to hear the
[10:54] gospel why because he just he just falls
[10:58] on deaf ears
[11:02] Paul's a master Paul's a prophet but I
[11:05] mean I'm telling you Paul that's why why
[11:08] would God want 80% of the New Testament
[11:11] that concerns us why would he want
[11:13] somebody to write it except Paul Paul
[11:15] would be the one I'd want to write it to
[11:17] cook you know why because Paul standing
[11:20] here he's already been a Pharisee he's
[11:21] been a part of the priesthood over here
[11:25] in the Old Testament part the scrolls in
[11:27] the Torah he is so well versed in that
[11:29] Peter what Peter was just a dumb
[11:33] fisherman and Ivan if he's sitting and
[11:35] he said yeah well that's he couldn't
[11:36] write his name now and probably had to
[11:41] have somebody write his first Peter
[11:43] second Peter and all that you know but
[11:47] he he told them and but here you got
[11:49] Paul writing these letters personally
[11:52] he's writing letters personally so God
[11:55] is speaking and then God said okay
[11:56] that's the Word of God that's eternal
[11:58] that's gonna stay there forever that's
[11:59] part of the Word of God so so we thank
[12:02] God for that
[12:02] all right so we're gonna have just a
[12:05] little bit of play time first 22 that
[12:17] night dr. Deisher
[12:18] a poll has trouble seeing yeah
[12:24] probably write another word to help
[12:35] derived the Epistle to the Romans yes I
[12:39] you know Paul you got to remember Paul
[12:43] didn't meet Luke wrote the book of Acts
[12:45] it was the Acts of the Apostles a lot of
[12:48] it was Paul but Luke running wrote the
[12:52] book black hole welcome back
[12:54] Luke wrote and he runs the Book of Luke
[12:55] in the book of Acts but what happened
[12:57] was in the book of Acts Luke was Paul
[13:00] personalisation so I went way to member
[13:03] where he went he just attached it I
[13:05] don't hook him say I'm sure I don't
[13:07] think Paul paid him to be there to be a
[13:11] doctor but Luke was a physician so blue
[13:14] but Luke got tied to Paul and then he
[13:16] wrote the whole book of Acts well that
[13:18] was a lot a lot of it was possible so so
[13:23] I'm not saying that Paul wrote the whole
[13:24] thing but he did he spoke to somebody in
[13:27] that wrote or in there a lot of times
[13:28] sometimes in here somewhere in one of
[13:30] these he says I write this by my own
[13:31] hand okay so in other words he does Rock
[13:34] some of it by his own hand and then you
[13:39] have tertius here who did that football
[13:46] am I ready
