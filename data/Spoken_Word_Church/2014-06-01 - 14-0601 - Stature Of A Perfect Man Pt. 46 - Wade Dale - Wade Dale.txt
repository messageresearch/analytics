TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we the devil didn't like this because I had all my you know we've been doing patience and all that on the screen I can't find them anywhere in my iPad so I lost him in Miami somewhere I again my voice and and all that so but you know we had a wonderful time done amen had a good time Still Still basking in the joy of of meeting you brothers and sisters really good solid brothers and sisters so here we go fifthly at godliness I know you probably can't see this in the back some of you older on but brother brother he's got his book He's reading he's got his book he going to read it but fifthly at godliness oh my godliness to be added so if God wants us to be Godly he's he's got to make a way for that to happen amen right I looked in four or five dictionaries and couldn't even find what he meant finally I was down at brother Jeff and he got a dictionary said godliness go back go back manually go back you ask here we go all right godliness means to be like now that's just pretty simple but now brother B couldn't just stop there and say oh we just got to be like God he's got to give us Provisions he's got to give us a provision for this journey if you got a good guide a good guide don't take you 20 mi back in the woods and say we don't have no food right they'd be one less God in the camp if he did that to me so anyway shoot it well no I don't know I'm at patience now I think so I I think I'd be patient one day with him until he got me some food but see the guide made a provision before you got there if he's a good guide he'll ask you do you want coffee in the morning you know I've been on several hunts like that you want coffee in the morning what do you want for breakfast what do you want for lunch and he'll map it out but you don't have to get it he gets it for you amen so he makes the provisions for you the Holy Ghost makes the provision for you before you even start your journey right so let's just put it this way we are living well below our privileges because the God's already there the God's already waiting on us to get on the horse he's already got the horse packed the pack horse is ready to go it's already got the provision it's just we got to say let's go all right it says to be like God after you got faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience then to be like God you say I can't do that brother brandom oh yes you can now there's a prophet prophet prophesying yes you can amen all right let me just read you a few scriptures here just a minute Matthew 5:48 we'll take this one and see what it sounds like Matthew 5:48 see if you're supposed to be like God you know the Bible says you're Gods okay Jesus said so see to me that's going back to Genesis 1:26 when they pick up the the Revelation and says ye are Gods you go right back to Genesis 126 cuz there you are the god of the earth remember the little G not the big G but the little G right right all the virtues all the things that's that's in God is in you amen now you believe that amen it's the same Holy Ghost Jesus speaking in the Beatitudes be ye therefore p e r f e c what's that perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect like we were talking about Miami we've done the series here on the Masterpiece family Daddy has also if you have the genetics of your father you're going to act like your father so he has got that provision even as your father in Heaven is perfect so you got to be perfect just like he's Perfect all right you get way up here now before you're asked to do that you see God's got these vertues laid out he knows you got to have this one and this one and this one and this one before you come to Godliness all right cuz if you have Godly patience Temperance and knowledge and virtue working in your life you're getting close to being like God the way he wants you to be okay you get way up here now before you're asked to do that all these things has to be added first remember what we were talking about you can't say well I got virtue and now I'm going to try for patience no the guide didn't say that the guide said virtue then knowledge then Temperance then patience then godliness okay then you get up here he's asked you now to be perfect godliness Sons and Daughters of God that's right how many things I could say along that line let's turn to Ephesians 4 find out over here what in the book of Ephesians it says about this thing to about how we should do Ephesians 4 he goes to 4 and 12 and he gave some Apostles and some prophets remember last night don't try to take the other man's office and some evangelists and some pastors and some teachers for the perfecting of God he says no God don't need perfected that's right he's already perfect that's right does it read like that says no the Perfection of what Saints who are the Saints the Sanctified ones so we're already Sanctified you're already sealed in with God you you know and and for our our ones that haven't been here in this church we believe you get the Holy Ghost at Faith not up there at the top that's a refilling that's more of the Holy Ghost but faith is where you if you don't have Holy Ghost you don't know what God's going to give you right amen you got to have Godly virtue well to have Godly virtue you got to have God in you because it says right here perfecting of what Sinners it don't say Sinners it says perfecting of the Saints let me explain it this way just like I was telling them in Miami and I've told you before but let me tell you again when you're born again you get all the medication you need for your sickness remember I talking about the peill amen you get a pill from the doctor you get a capsule the doctor says this pill will take care of everything in your body and you go home and you tell all your neighbors and say oh this pill will take care of everything it's everything I need and you lay it on the kitchen counter and you leave it there you're going to die be sick and die yeah but the Cure is laying right there but it's encapsulated or it's or it's bound by what's on the outside the the plastic or the or the what you call the gelatin the gelatin around the outside right our sister's a nurse you ought to know that gelatin around here but inside's what's going to do you good but if you take that believe what's going to help you put it in your mouth it'll dissolve and what's on the inside is going to perfect you same thing with the gospel you're born again at Faith you've got the new birth you've got all these virtues potentially to work in your life amen that's right and if you die if you get born again today and die tomorrow you're going to be you're Eternal amen amen if you're born again now not justified not Sanctified but I'm talking about born again the old nature burn out God's nature put in you and it's you and God in there as persons amen that's the new birth it's not just a hope so or a wish so you're just as Eternal as God is but we're still alive the ones that are alive and have been born again for years months days whatever God's requiring that we add to our stature not statue right stature all right which is highest our growth development so God has given you all the provisions the guide has got everything ready but you got to say hey let's go I want to go hunting cuz he's going to ask you he said you ready to go that's what they tell me they'll come in there at 5:00 in the morning they'll go you ready to go you know what I got got to go out I got to unlock that door and I got to get my clothes on and I got to go but he's got all the provisions for the journey already on the horse or already in the truck or or in the four-wheeler or whatever you understand what I'm saying using natural illustrations here right but that's what God has give us with a new birth he's give us everything we need but we got to get up and go and say hey God I want to have the perfecting of the Saints that's what I want I want that to happen in my life I I'm not satisfied with just being born again that's cuz there's more and there should be a pull or aing inside uh you know babies are born babies and they're wonderful amen and and you know little Eli and my grandbaby 6 years old they're just wonderful but you [ __ ] them if you keep them at that age 5 years from now if he's still that age you've done something wrong no you feed him and he grows and grows and grows and grows and grows you want him to be an adult sometimes you know sometimes I'd love for Deana to be 6 years old and not not change but see I know that's that's hindering her not me it's hindering her yes and it's me as a as a terrible sight as a grandfather or father to want them to be that way stay that way you want them to grow up you want them to to get a job and get out of the house amen hallelujah and just come back and visit not listen not in Extended Stay mot for the perfecting of God no for the perfecting of Sinners no but for the perfecting of the Saints the Sanctified one see he goes right on in who are the Saints the Sanctified ones the one started from down here now I believe he's pointing right here right here yes down here right the ones that started at Fai all right I got to turn this thing on hang on AE hold on just a second what's the matter my tablet has been in Miami and it's just all yeah but anyway let's get through this I'll I'll make it move back and forth can you read that perfecting of the Saints for the working see it doesn't stop for the working of the ministry the ministry of Jesus Christ for the edifying of the body of Christ which is all of us all right for the edifying building it up edifying cuz remember what we said about virtue virtue is something that people draw from people draw that virtue from you you draw virtue from somebody else right okay till we all come to the what Unity of the faith One Faith one Lord one baptism and the knowledge of the Son of God and to the perfect man he's not finished man he's just heaping us on here in the book of Ephesians because you know what the people in the book of Ephesians they can handle it they were more mature they can understand what Paul was talking about all right to to the perfect man unto the Assurance oh my to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ perfect takes godliness amen you have to add to your faith godliness see you start off down here with virtue then you go to knowledge then Temperance patience now you're on godliness godliness oh my time's getting away but you know what godliness meant you sung the song to be like Jesus to be like Jesus on Earth I long to be like him all through life Journey from Earth to Glory I only ask to be like him so you add to your God add godliness now next is going to be brotherly kindness all right now look you said that's an easy one to me it's one of the hard it is the hardest one M if not it'd be down there below right it's right up there before God seals you in and adopts you into the body you got to be able to love your brother whether he hates your guts or not Jesus said the greatest commandment is to love your neighbor as you love yourself now he's talking about loving your neighbor the same as you love your own self that's right that's hard people that's hard that's hard that's going to be real hard cuz brother Bri says he does not spend a lot of time on godliness that's about all he spent on godliness then he goes right into brotherly kindness but now he spends a pretty good time on Godly I mean on brotherly kindness why it's very well needed that's right and that's that's our problem right it's brotherly kindness or we wouldn't act sometimes the way we do so read up read brotherly kindness in your statute of perfect man see what brother B says about it go ahead you know to me buing your neighbor is easier than brotherly kindness because brother and sister you know the closer you live with somebody the more you get to know them or dislike certain things but your neighbor yep you know you try to with your property what you would want him to do on his side and I think he says love them whether they love you or not see that's where that's the whole thing you got to love them whether they love you or not right so what it is it comes down to the to the meaning of it doesn't matter what anybody else thinks of you right but it's what you think of others it's not it's Jesus it didn't bother him for Kus and him to call him illegitimate or what didn't bother him a bit that didn't he didn't go off somewhere in pout like we do and say oh he called me Serpent seed or he called me the devil he called cus everybody was calling Jesus the devil they said he was the son of BS now he didn't jump up on his stump and say well bless God I you know no he knew who he was that's and when we get to where we know who we are a lot of these things are going to do just like that pyramid just like that dream of sister Shepherd that water is just going to run right off it run right by her feet and that trash just run right out of that dream didn't stick on her didn't stick on nothing it just run right out I was just listening to conferences and a lady at the end started speaking in tongues while he was still speaking he totally ignored it I mean it was like yes and then did you notice she kind of started shouting as she was speaking in tongues like that little devil was right trying to make disturb him sure he totally Ed it no well the spirit of the Prophet subject to the prophet so he knew that he knew that sure and you know what that could have been of God but that lady there's your power without character cuz she could speak in tongues and it be a true message from God but if she had the virtues it would have held her to after the service was over and and what was inside of her would have known but she but brother BR says they're just Pentecostal babies what you're a baby at Faith right and he allowed that to happen he didn't now he told one woman to sit down and shut up one time but say I believe he come to a place where he said that's enough of that right you're grieving the spirit amen all right and and she got more in herself remember she started fixing her hair up he said I noticed she started fixing everything you know she was making a show out of it right now if you make a show out of it that ain't of God all right but if it's of God you have to hold your peace until the right time the right order and if she would have been own up in the Statue of a perfect man she would have sat there but see they were all Pentecostal babies they didn't know nothing about virtue and all this temper patience go this whole world didn't know nothing about it till brother rown came sure Peter and them had it but Peter and them had a very small group of people to talk to brother Brown's speaking to the world he's trying to get a world not a world but a world of believers perfected so we can get to a body change cuz you're not going to get to a body change till that headstone com that's right there's no way nobody's ever took a body changeed except Jesus Christ a permanent body change amen Abraham's body was changed but he died lazarus's body was changed but he died everybody but Jesus's body was changed and he didn't die again so he's he's reached immortality so the only way for us to get it is for him to come back here like brother Dale's preaching now him not in a physical form but in a bride that's right and the bride's going to have to speak the brid one is going to have to bring this thing to pass okay all right let's go Lord bless you
