3 and then we will go to acts one and it will be acts one and then over into Acts 2 to remember the Bible study will be this coming Saturday at 6:00 so just come and have us this what we call common questions and answers in other words nothing set just whatever comes up questions and answers and that we have and you know that way we have a good time in the Lord remember Wade and June driving back this afternoon after he gets through of the services there and just remember pray one for another the Lord would bless amen John 3 acts 1 and then Acts 2 okay Heavenly Father Our Savior our Lord Our Redeemer our All In All In Jesus is your name thank you for the day and the hour that we have thank you for your love and your grace unto us thank you for you I just ask you to help us this afternoon because we approach a part that has been well misunderstood by a lot of people and taught in many different ways yet we want to try to bring it to where that we can believe that you have are the one that is speaking it unto us and that you're giving it unto us by revelation we love you we thank you and just close our mouth to the things that would not be needful that we could speak what you would give us and that your love may be made manifest in our hearts forgive our sins cleanse us and keep us father we love you we thank you for all things bless the little brigh around the world as we all Endeavor for one thing and that's to come to a place to where we can walk off of this Earth and be with you have your way now and keep us in jesus' name amen amen John 3 there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus the ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi we know that thou art a teacher verse 10 says Thou Art a teacher brother R said the original said art the teacher all right so then coming down there are a teacher come from God for no man can do these M Jesus refer he's referring to Jesus is being the teacher and and Jesus refers to him as being the teacher let me get it right now we want misunderstand Rabbi know we know that th are a teacher come from God for no man can do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Nicodemus sayth unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's W and be born Jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is Spirit Marvel not that I said unto thee you must be borned again now let's go to acts 1 verse 8 but you shall repeat see Power the Lord Jesus speaking see to the disciples and you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses of me both in Jerusalem and in Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth okay then Acts 2 and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all in one Accord in one place and suddenly Accord Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of rushing Mighty Wind and filled all the house where they were sitting there appeared unto them clothing tongues like as of fire and it set upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with tongues as the spirit gave them utterance you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now I want to you know just kind of preach across for a little bit and then we'll back up and go through the things that you know we need to and this can be counted in as one of those things of the doctrines that I said I would get to eventually and preach on some of the the doctrines of the people of the message that and the reason I don't believe them and what I believe the truth is you know and this can be counted in with that too because uh if you go out among the denominations and everything and you ask them what is the new birth and one's going to tell you this and one's going to tell you that and uh you know different things and you be shouting speaking in tongues uh feelings is involved uh believing and just accepting and all kind of things that they'd be saying like then you come among the Believers of what you call the Believers of the message and uh you find that some of them are saying that well brother random change here and he changed there and uh it's you know uh pretty well among us just like it is anywhere else and uh but I want to just talk to us and just ask us what is the new birth now to follow that as I was saying this morning in the message if you approach something this a blunt statement like a lot of people try to and uh you know you say well what is the new birth well you can give a quote that it's the revelation of Jesus Christ uh you can give a quote that it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost uh you you got quotes that we'll get to in a few minutes you'll see that brother ROM calls believing the new birth then he will talk about the being baptized into the body that's the new birth and he'll talk about just that baptism of the Holy Ghost as being in the body that's we talking about New Birth now right all right and then uh if we have time we'll conclude by bringing it to what I believe is what he was really bringing it all to is that the headstone uniting with the body will be the new birth which will um end up ever how you want to say it by the change of this body and we'll step into eternity Body Spirit and soul and then you can say you got the new birth all right so then it's a vast thing to be covered and it would take it took the prophet um 40 years so if we go that long this afternoon you know we try not to but uh I want to make sure that we get it right then if you want to have questions and answers on it I'm I'm always pleased to to have questions and answers now if you misunderstand something I say uh the only thing I would ask you to do I would ask you to do one thing it may solve a lot of problems if you have a something that you misunderstand write it down all J it down what I'm speaking you know did you mean this did you mean that what write it down you know all right but they not ask you to do one thing to my save some problems in time is to go back and listen to the tape you know and and you know kind of Mark if you want to the time and say well it's got to be in the first half of the you know it's got to be in the first hour you might save you a lot of trouble trying to find it on the tape but go to the tape and listen to it to see because in that way and I probably will too myself because I can I know I can make human errors in speech and and being a human being I'm sorry but I will do that as a human being and and it doesn't bother me for somebody to say you said so and so all right as long as I said it it doesn't bother me I can go back and correct it I can say well that's exactly what I meant you know or I can say now you heard me say this this is what I meant got to be like brother R said but that fell you know said don't take what I say said take what I meant you know so that way let the Holy Spirit be in you to to help and to do and and to give an understanding because it is a vast territory and I told you this morning one key to it is that brother brandom the ages as they came down and that was so marvelous to me when I seen it when he started preaching you know when I first started reading of the message and how that he would talk about Luther's justification Wesley sanctification Pentecostal baptism and he say when now here come the Presbyterian restoring some of of the predestination here would come the Baptist with the immersing down in the water you know the baptizo and and doing those things and U you know that was to me was an amazing thing to think about how God could keep this thing so straight and then a prophet would come cuz see we never had anybody back there to be able to help us uh you know I mean we were Baptist and they just said all you got to do to believe and I then I asked them I said well how come it says believe us right it doesn't say just believe it says believe us you know and and I wanted to know and you know and then as I always try to say that I didn't just accept the fact that I Was Born Again by just something that happened something that took place I've told you about seeing God in a form in a church about 11 years old I never took that as my new birth uh I come to a place one day if you have asked me after I joined the church there in the Baptist form I would have said that was my new birth that I believed on the Lord Jesus Christ but then when I came into the message and seen how the prophet was expressing thing even in seemingly contradictory I said seemingly now contradictory statements I was still happy to see the things that he was saying and then I realized that I was not born again and then it was 2 years before I received the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know and and all of that but uh you know after I come into the message but that was an amazing thing to look back and see just ification see that your church went down it come on the day of Pentecost come over through the the Dark Ages went down into the ground and came back out with two little shoots of Luther with the just shall live by faith and then wesle we come along preaching sanctification all right and then the Pentecostals with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I believe that those people down through there I'm not like some that say that people have said you know that that Luther wesle and Pentecost didn't have nothing now I don't agree with that I believe it was the new birth in the days of Luther and there is a direct quote I'll be glad to find for you I was looking at it this morning that brother around that said called the sa the new birth of sanctification all right but you see you got to remember that they can only be responsible for what they heard you're coming out of the dark ages of the thing that where it had U Been beat down or whatever you want to use the word for eating down until uh basically all they had was and I was reading a little bit about the Bible the other day and basically all they had was just certain scriptures that they were allowed to read you know through the Consol Catholicism age and uh you know they didn't have a Bible they would even burn them and try to destroy them and their point was that we don't want the uh Bible to be put into the hand of illiterate people now I'm quoting them you know and saying that because you would have the illiterate trying to understand God and said it can't be understood by the illiterate folks you know but see I differ on that amen and all but you know but in seeing that their thoughts maybe was good to protect or do but yet it kept the Bible from being in people's hands but didn't stop God right amen he went on with the WFTS and the the the the different ones that brought the different forms of the Bible and brought them into Germany and brought all kind of of doings and and coming down through there and and keeping it to leaving the Catholic Church bringing your uh different things that they kept uh the what is the got it the U I'll take a minute about the Catholics uh Latin vate uh and and see even God made the Catholic Church preserve the Bible you know he made them even preserve it correctly even though they wouldn't let their people have it right he made them preserve it to where later that it could be brought out you know and put into what we call the Bible of today you know to understand so it's wonderful to look back there so then I believe now I'm telling you what I believe up for and then we'll get on to the to the message I believe that the lutherans that really receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth need that strength that uh they when they believed on the Lord Jesus Christ and accepted him as their savior that was the new birth right the just shall live by faith see and that brought a new birth all right so then you go on to the other different people coming up and and God adding to the church now not what some man come up with the idea but Wesley coming along with sanctification uh that would be the new birth the Baptist people coming along with with John Smith and them with the the doctrine of baptism and you know baptizo bring putting you down in the water and the different things being restored and and each age coming down even to your your Pilgrim Holiness and things like that those were a move of God in the time then you come into the Pentecost and then you come on into the the hour that we're living and see I believe that the people there that were really born they were people that are really born again in each one of those ages right because if they wasn't born again how are they going to get born again all right but yet it's not it was required only of believing on the Lord Jesus Christ as not understand what I'm saying what was the Catholic Church doing when Luther said to Jos you live by faith they were teaching believe on the Lord Jesus Christ come on right I mean they were teaching believe on the Lord Jesus Christ but didn't they had the marriage and all the other involved but they were still teaching believe on the Lord Jesus Christ for your salvation all right we see then when Luther came out with it it just struck him to just shall live by faith because they had salvation based upon purely works and doings and and things like that and even that's why brother Ram not throw off on the Catholics like everybody thinks he does but he said the original church was Catholic right youever heard him say that the original church was Catholic CU Catholic means Universal that's all it means it Universal all right and he said they were say they were the original and they were he said all but everything cabbage down brought it down to a basis that you know you can go through the uh I will restore Etc the canor palor Locust caterpillar but just getting down to the the doings brother random would not go back and cover a lot then he would just cover justification under Luther sanctification under Wesley baptism of the Holy Ghost under the Pentecostals all right now not that each one wasn't getting the birth but the Lutheran didn't get the baptism of the Holy Ghost like they got it on the day of Pentecost of the works and you talk what I'm talking about three stages they got the New Birth by believing right all right Wesley and them got second work but that was still not like the book of Acts and the basis that it was still the new birth but not the basis of the second work of you know second stage and then when you come into isusa Street then your original Pentecost costal people required you to go through justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost to be called in your birth you just didn't walk in on original right ones now pure ones true ones are you following me yes so if you miss me somewhere you come listen to that I said right ones pure ones true ones I didn't say everybody don't everybody spoke in tongu brother R said didn't have it right so if they didn't have it they didn't teach it right amen right but see the true were teaching as much as they could and even ausa Street was trinitarians 1906 isusa Street was trinitarians it was like about 1912 somewhere in there 14 before that you come along with the Oneness Doctrine being taught but that didn't still didn't mean that God couldn't give him the baptism of the Holy Co CU he did and see in that way brother random would say he said I met people that receive the Holy Ghost might say 50 years or something before him he said exactly like the day of Pentecost well then the preachers in this message go HeyWire trying to figure that one out don't they say well there all we look at them people look what they didn't have nothing we look at it and he says they had the Holy Ghost well then I remember I took that topic and broke it down to where on the day of Pentecost there was two things took place one was The Upper Room experience of 120 that had been tutored for three and a half years they had went through as we talked about this morning justification sanctification all right they had the gifts working they had the the uh the dad they saw it raised they they had all of the gifts he gave them power to do all of these things all right and that was only under sanctification all right now so then when the Holy Ghost did come it quickened 120 and put them and I'll point to the pyramid for others it's the pyramid we look at you know Faith virt knowledge temp here's where you see Holy Spirit the 120 received the Holy Spirit right there cuz they' been two to 3 and9 years they went outside pre preached the sermon you know 3,000 got saved they didn't have enough word to be up here they come in the body at Christ I mean Faith but that was a new birth so brother around said he met people with a new birth just like the day of Pentecost he's exactly right right when you receive the new birth justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth you get it exactly like the 3,000 got it right you don't get it like the apostles got it you got to grow in Grace and knowledge right and coming up to that point all right now in looking at it that way we can see that the the things brother around said are not contradictory right they need to be placed in order all right and placing it in order we come to a better understanding of what he's saying okay now so we see the ages ties together with the new birth the seals tie together because we ended up with the quote about the the seals opening and the clim being placed upon us so they would be that and he said there's a mysterious part in the seal book of justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost in This Day to be understood because of the opening of the seals amen all right so that would mean down through there even though Paul and them had a great understanding about the baptism of the Holy Ghost great understanding about the godhead but still there would be things in the end time that would be revealed through or by way of the Prophet Amen to bring us the message all right now that would work out then to tie together everything brother brand says everything the Bible would say about it and placing it in order that if we get it laid in order it'll make a beautiful picture amen but if we fail to then we will miss it all right so now here's what I want you to believe I mean want you to listen to me not believe it you pray for God to reveal it to you I just preach all right I believe you can call the New Birth Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ cuz that's what Luther did right you can call the New Birth sanctification because that's what Wesley did you can call them the new birth as the baptism of the Holy Ghost cuz that's what ausa street did all right and you can place it then in order and it'll come out to make a beautiful picture to see the Plan of Salvation for world for man for the ages for time and everything fits into a beautiful category all right now so when I go through I'll try to stop and express this is what I'm saying this is what brother R is saying this this is what I'm saying this is what he's saying so you know because I want you to understand and at least you have the information I am one that will give you information I look at some quotes sometimes and I do decide not to bring them because maybe it would be confusing to the younger ones but uh I'll be glad to put them in anytime you want one put in to you know something you said run around said so and so well bring it to me I'll be glad to place it within and and do it all right but now see then I I said I believe the new birth and run around and preach the message you must be born again and on that message I think it's 59 he said I can conclusively prove something in those words a little paraphrasing that you're born again and then baptize into the body we'll read in a minute where the Prophet will say that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is not the New Birth the new birth is when you believe and then he'll explain who he's talking about you'll say well and that's hold this point because it is true brother Ram is preaching the new birth and then he's preaching adoption to go in with that to bring you into those forms but he'll tell you there's one in here I know or twoo where he says that the people received the new birth they were there under a poish before Paul came to him and said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe well then you'll see what he's doing and then he can say that when you believe you receive eternal life you say the baptism of the Holy Ghost only positions you in the body of Christ for the gifts for the power and these are the things will be read through here it must come together to to bring a correct understanding all right and doing that let's take one scripture brother's going to put it up some put up first Peter we're familiar scripture with us First Peter 1 22 and 23 Peter says seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfine love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever now being born again is a word using being means a process right of going on something is transpiring you are being born again all right now we'll read in a little while where brother R says your new birth starts when you believe he said but brother I've always thought it was the baptism you know Earth see Pentecostal thought filtering through your mind and the people of this message still have that CU some of them believe that brother R was wrong and later he said it's just the baptism well 64 Christ U Future home he said he taught three processors or phases stages all the way through his life and if you'll notice the interlacing that I chose the word that I'll use one of 54 61 59 backwards and forth and then you have to look at it and say but yeah now wait a minute brother Dale what we want is I what's after the seals well then you're rejecting the message and how could it be that brother Ram could preach anything if he didn't have a foundation and if his foundation was not correct then how could God come and bring the seals okay and when he went beyond the curtain of time he said I preach what Paul preached and the people holiday men so then it's not to just say well you just confusing me no no I ain't going to confuse nobody today I'm going to try to straighten out confusion bless all right because we born that way right and our mind runs on the wrong Channel all right so we need to get it right all right so being born again meaning something starts it keeps on going it gets greater and greater until it is finally consummated finished whatever the word amen in what God intended for it to do amen amen that's right and I said I believe that you can believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you be baptized into the body then this body can be changed and we go meet the Lord and we say we got the new birth right go we're being born again amen how I like the scripture you didn't say being born again is because of an act taking place right how are you being born again by the word of God that's right right not by the corruptible seed of man not by doctrines or ideas and as I was saying a while ago then when you receive the new birth everybody since the day of Pentecost except 120 receives the new birth right here at Faith and then you're being born again adding to your faith Ro your knowledge temper face Godless brother kind and come out to the headstone all right now so let's start with the it's getting to the point now and uh we lost 30 minutes but that's all right amen now I believe in this day everybody with me this day yes I explained Luther explain Wesley in this day believing is not the new birth in the day that we're living right all right sanctification is not the new birth in the day we're living the baptism now listen now you going to jump with me so hold on to the point the baptism is not the new birth in this day right now listen the new birth today that will go all the way and through and finish with the chain the new birth is justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right do you follow me when we get down in a minute brother Brown say they say the baptism is the new birth he said they're wrong see in this day it's justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost you cannot be born again today without going through justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right I make it blunt where everybody will understand me and that's what I believe all right and in doing that then that you you can be justified without receiving the Holy Ghost you can be Sanctified without receiving it but you can't be baptized into the body without being justified Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost in the this day since theusa Street started with the three it came back that's what it's required brother Brown said the last three ages completed the birth we'll give that in a minute I think it's in my notes so now let's let's just read some things that we're not talking about let me read it let me say this I am not talking about anointed ones forget it forget it okay and see your your mind will run anointed ones where the Prophet would say the anointed ones can have the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost right that's right on their Spirit come on and still be lost right right right read or listen to anointed once in time but you can't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul right and ever be lost right cuz there's no way of it because it would play so you're going to have to listen real careful and as I said then when you misunderstand me or anybody on tape anywhere listening when you hear this you go back and you listen to what I said and you might find out it answers your question before you call me but don't worry about it call me from anywhere in the world except please make up I get you 3:00 in the morning from Zimbabwe or or something like that I mean they just don't calculate they just di it up you know and then I can't understand them we've got a phone that we run it up that I get on to it you know where I can at least hear the words but I'll tell them to please slow down yes I'm having trouble understanding you right well then they say okay brother I'm not throwing off on them now right I'm just telling like it is right all right so if you call me I used to have a brother used to call me 12:01 he's here in the United States you know why go on that day the rate changed at 12 oh my oh my I was working at General Motors getting up at 4:00 you know all right I told my brother I'll pay the phone call call me reverse a charge just call me before 10 but you know just get that going to shake you off where you won't be so tired about what I've preached up so far but now you can be justified and Sanctified without receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost but now watch brother R I think it's in here he says you can't have baptism of the Holy Ghost without having the father and the son right right right you you can't have it you can't divide it up see if you divided it up so you're going to get you three gods in there you're going to mess up things if you say you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that baptism of the Holy Ghost is the spirit of God or if you call it the father or you call it the spirit of Christ whatever you're saying there's just one God right right so you can't have the father without having the son that's right all right are you with me amen you can't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost without having the father right so you you see it's going to take a vast amount of time to tie together the Loose Ends to where it all come together and you'll see when brother R was saying what he was saying he was right at least I hope so all right so we're not talking about anointed ones to end time forget it right that's twice stat it you come up with something you know we why there you don't understand about this I'm not talking about anointed ones I'm talking about genuine Born Again Holy Ghost filed Christian the children of God right okay not talking about anointing ones right so now we want to look at some quotes and look at some things and see what to if we can piece together then you'll see why I I like to take a subject and then I wait I've been studying this subject for 40 something years knowing the thing seemingly contrary one to the other I've preached on it before and I do believe that brother R was trying to preach a dotion in his early Ministry but also known by his quotes that he was not just preaching adoption he was preaching the truth amen for the age and time or whatever it was all right sir how can you cover the new birth and leave out Luther and Wesley you can't do it Luther taught justification as Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ by faith and that was his new birth right that's right truly surely we know that he probably taught and made books and wrote essays or whatever you call them about the Lord Jesus Christ right and he claimed the Lord Jesus Christ for his salvation but God was going to start a work or to bring forth his word so Luth was reading there in the scripture about the just shall live by faith and he clicked and that was the new birth of that age right now others that were believ in Catholicism from their own now now you know there's overlaps so don't misunderstand me so I've never heard about it to give you an illustration somebody asked brother Bram to go talk to their father and to see where he was in the Lord he goes in Li and talks with him do say thing comes back out and this story was told and said your father's all right he's under another age if you're not responsible God doesn't hold you responsible until truth has been presented now those that back off somewhere never heard of of uh Martin Luther and all the things they may have been okay and God would went through it but those who heard Martin Luther teach the just shall live by faith it was required that they received that right that he was teaching to be in that body of Christ for that day so is it with Wesley so is it coming down to all ages see each believer had to accept the message that was presented to them that's why you'll hear Brother Brown say that the people want to stay in a denomination and claim the new birth or message of the age it's a good one is it you mean you could do that yes doesn't mean you got to go to the Baptist to stay in the age it don't mean you got to go to the Pentecost to stay in the age it means you got that mindset you got that understanding you got that thought and so you can be CL you're in the message claim to be in the message and not have the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's why that that's not the evidence the evidence is whether or not the spirit of God in you will agree with the word right if it's not in there it won't agree that's right simple language but that's what your Prophet said all right see the true Pentecostals now notice I use the word true and thing like that so you won't be dealing with this everybody in their fanaticism the true Pentecostals taught them the baptism of the Holy Ghost after you are Justified and Sanctified are they taught three stages of Grace and many of them did not get the new birth of their ages so let's pull up this and give a couple of quotes to start on the point number one brother look what brother R said well we found out this is from the message then Jesus came and called we found out many of them said they believed and didn't have it in the days of John Wesley if they got the Second Blessing they called it sanctification entire sanctification that's really a weirdo when you go to entire sanctification you really are going Beyond John Wesley he never taught entire sanctification they did after him they got happy and they shouted everybody shouted had it but they found out they didn't have it a lot of them shouted and didn't have it the days of Pentecost they said now the restoration of the gifts has come the baptism of the Holy Spirit he that speaks in tongues has got it we found out that many spoke in tongues and didn't have it you know that brother random talks about the the zeusa street Pentecost and he said the same holy ghost that justified the Luther sanctify the Methodist baptized the Pentecostals what is Now setting in order the coming of the Lord so he ties it all together just give you another one to where we'll have it first we would see Jesus 1964 304 Lutheran said when you believe that's all you have to do you're justified by faith believe many said they believ and didn't have it we know that Along Came Wesley with what with what called the second work of Grace sanctification all shouts and are Sanctified and got it many shouted didn't have it long come to Pentecost said all that speaks in tongues speaks with tongues has got it many spoke with tongues and didn't have it listen even comes along gets past that he comes in he said Along Comes the Christian Science and said it's love the fruit of the spirit many of them shows fruits of the spirit and don't have it so it's not just because what you say with your mouth it's what you possess you can say I'm a Christian I've been Justified Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost all right now here's my point you ask them and say well what happened to you what do you mean what happened to me well what happened when you got Justified Saied f with all God well I just went to the Altar and I prayed through and got the Holy Ghost come up speaking in tongues now believe the message what the prophet said M said to got it didn't get it that don't mean everybody cuz there was genuine bride down to every age right right they really had the real goods and stood on the word all right what is required for the age brother R have went through explain what was required for each age all right but then what is required for this age to say that we're truly born again is we got to come to the three stages justification sanctification baptism and the Holy Ghost go ahead with number three brother preaching from a hidden life in ch Christ that's the same thing it takes to make up the new birth water blood and spirit justification by faith believing on the Lord Jesus Christ cleansing up the sanctification through the blood and then the baptism of the Holy Spirit to put you in the holiest of holies he said to put you in the holy of holies remember you had an outer Court the Old Testament you had an inner Court and then you had a holy of holies right a gentile could come into the outer court but he could not step into the inner court and only the high priest to go into the holy of holies right all right so now he's tied it all getting it all it's all tied together to put you in the holies of holies now that constitutes the man who is separated seated from God and hid away in Christ that don't mean you know what he's saying he ain't saying separated from God the man who separated and then he in Christ I say this with reverence to many of us playing in the hour the courts yet see we don't take our lives over we don't take our lives over with Christ to be hid away the fruits of the spirit Pro it see you see that we might think that what that we are are but until your life measures up with that that's what proves it Jesus said by their fruits you shall know them not by their denominations but by their fruits you shall know them there's one that would we could probably cover a long Doctrine on people say now it's not the fruit of the spirit kind no priest can have that that didn't do away with the fruits of the spirit right right did it do away with the fruits of the spirit CU kind no priest can have it m i I thought that fruit you know the fruits of the spirit was love joy peace goodness meekness that a true Christian had all right watch now watch this point look at number four now preaching on the countdown 1962 so if a man sits on the thought of just justification is all you have to have he's wrong wrong you got to be wrong and it's a church who believes like many other Pentecostals that the Holy Ghost is it that's all just repent and get the Holy Ghost that's still wrong because you got to get Sanctified in there to cleanse it before the Holy Ghost comes in if you don't you live leave out the blood see and the new birth as people talk that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the new birth now that's wrong you're reading it now the baptism of the Holy Ghost is different from the new Earth he say I believe everything brother Brown says I believe what's been revealed to me the baptism of the Holy Ghost is different from the New Birth the new birth is when you're born again but the Holy Ghost is when power comes into that birth for service that's exactly the Holy Ghost is baptized into the Holy Ghost now remember that's 1962 right now remember and I'll repeat this a lot in the future home in 64 he said I taught three stages of Grace from the beginning never changed look like he's changing here doesn't it especially when he says people say that the baptism of the Holy Ghost baptism of the Holy Ghost your is in your birth said well I'm confused well your Prophet said or you going to say he's confused that leaves it into our laps the wrong way doesn't it cuz we don't like that kind of language all right so now listen to what we're going to go to the next one number five now this is the countdown preached in 19 excuse me that other was countdown but that was paragraph 37 this is 3839 the new birth you have the New Birth by being Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ see by having faith and accepting him as your savior that's birth see because you passed from death into life right if you want to back that up take John St John 5:24 he that Hearth my words and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life he's got life because he believes and that same group that had to go to Pentecost to be baptized with the Holy Ghost now he's talking about the disciples right he talking about the disciples having eternal life by their new birth and Jesus Christ ain't died yet okay so where we at now holy ghost is power for service so when you talk about you got to be born again and applying that to the Holy Ghost many of the methodists and so forth are wrong there it cannot it just won cope through the scripture here you get the thing sideways it's got to take it the way the scriptures got it placed out here the and the Holy Spirit is he shall receive the new birth after this what no cuz that's not what the scripture said scripture says you shall receive power Acts 1:8 after the Holy Ghost has come upon you see and they had already believed to eternal life I talk about the disciples and so forth but they had to have the Holy Ghost for power he shall be Witnesses unto me after the Holy Ghost has come upon you because the Holy Ghost is a witness of the resurrection showing that you have become an adult in Christ now let's see if we really believe did they have eternal life in their soul if so Jesus didn't have to die so when you're correcting brother R I'm correcting you that blown enough my correcting brother R got no sense no better than that I know he knows what he talking about right but you see they were believing unto eternal life but as I said this morning there were a lot of people that believ Jesus but were worthy when the day of Pentecost came even seen of 500 Brethren after the resurrection where was the 380 and why brother Brandon will make the statement you are saved according to your confession you say you're a Christian you're a Christian you say you're not a Christian you're not a Christian now let's see if you can swallow are you going to say that Judas was not a Believer are you going to say that Judas wasn't Sanctified in St John 17 let you think what are you going to say well you just got me confused I don't know what to say good you're in a good good place right if you really don't know what to say but if you get running your blabbering mouth you'll figure out something so Judas was believing unto eternal life that's right you can call it Born Again call it new birth but where he was at there was no way to receive eternal life in his soul right so he died and went to hell why because he turned down and proved that his justification and sanctification was not genuine now come on you will a me and more brother Rand will say people will say well you know this that say what about Judas he had part of the ministry the Bible said he did so brother random is having to be speaking of a believing unto eternal life you as I say said if you're Justified and you die in that place the prophet said sure you're going to heaven there's a lot of difference in going to heaven there's at least two ways to get there both of them to the blood of Jesus Christ but one of them can be a foolish virgin to be given eternal life later the other one has eternal life here lot of difference all right then the new birth is believing the disciples were Believers you can cover them as the New Birth when the scripture said that the spirit had not been given because Jesus had not been glorified so it was a potential right it was not a reality it was a reality Jesus Christ died in vain because all he had to do is turn around and give come on he had done give them the power right right the disciples had the power to cast out Devils heal the sick and all the things before they reive the baptism of the Holy Ghost he took the power away from them and told them to go to Jerusalem and abide and don't try to preach no more cuz you don't have the inside teacher so you can get confused and that's what the people in this message has done I'm going to say it you believe what you want to they don't wait for the teacher to be able to put the word together come on it's true they run off well I just got this quote and I got that quote how many quotes you want but if I've got one that turns it down what are you doing put it all together and let's see you say but I thought the new birth brother Dale for this age was the baptism of the Holy Spirit and that's true because the baptism of the holy spirit is justification sanctification the baptism of the holy spirit because what chopped off you pie sins was a Holy Spirit right what Sanctified you was the holy spirit amen what is the birth is the holy spirit amen see but the new birth for Lucifer's age which you just believe and accept that Jesus Paid the price so the new verse for the disciples that we just read about was to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ right that's why the new birth wasn't completed in Luther's age so you can call it a potential you can call it partial realization brother around we use those words you see in this age we got to come to a to the ending of all things but in this age it requires that we must accept the truth the truth of what now listen the truth the truth the truth of what Luther Tau all that you shall live by faith we've got to accept that now what all he talk trinitarian is I didn't say that we must accept what Wesley Tau right knowing that in Wesley's day if you looked at the the quotes that were up there the basics under Luther's message was sanctification by the chemistry of the blood right this is basically what he Tau get your song books and look at all the songs that was written in Wesley's age I know it was of Blood come on because Wesley thought that sanctification being the second stage was the chemistry of the blood come on go to the Token message and listen to brother brand explain it there's four of them you'll hear him explain it good Wesley thought it was the blood he said and we know now it's the life that was in the blood that's right it makes it different see so today we accept Jesus Christ as our savior as Luther taught it of the just shall live by faith and then we believe of the sanctification of Wesley that the blood does have a part to do in it because the life was in the blood and then blood of animal say you are not saved by the blood what's the rest of the quote you are kept saved by the blood that's right he said you're saved by grace through faith that's right amen you're kept saved by the blood right come on what you're Prophet say so the blood is a bumper over us to keep us saved right come on see today when we accept Jesus Christ as our savior that starts the new birth but it's not completed until we receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost in our soul right now remember how I've taught it before the P two messages justification doesn't do anything about the soul chops off the sin of the Soul we covered it this morning that sanctification starts dealing with the soul of the unclean spirit being driven out not just out of your body and spirit but been driven out of your soul right to make way for the baptism now let's read a few that sound astounding go ahead brother number six paragraph 363 365 questions and answers on the Hebrews part 2 57 102 we trying to make it just briefly plain as I know how to make it now when you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ you then have the new birth When You Believe on the Lord you receive a new thought a new life but it isn't the baptism of the Holy Ghost see you got the New Birth when you believe you've got eternal life it's a gift of God that's GI to you through Sovereign Grace by accepting the gift that God is giving to you see he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me half eternal life or is which the scripture as everlasting life that's the new birth you're converted it means you turned around but the baptism of the Holy Ghost puts you into the body of Christ subject to the gifts for service it doesn't make you any more of a Christian are you reading what he saying it just put you into the body of gifts see now by one Spirit 1 Corinthians 12 we're all baptized into one body now Paul says there are different gifts and in this body it's nine spiritual gifts and this body you have to be baptized into the body to possess one of these gifts they come with the body so he says you're converted you accepted Jesus Christ now let's go on to the rest of that paragraph see but now as far as having eternal life and being a Christian you are a Christian the moment you believe amen now that's not make Bel I'm glad he put that in there CU it would come up me saying it right that's not make believe that's truly believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and accept him as your personal savior you're born again right there and have eternal life listen God comes into you you I'm in trouble saying now watch eternal life Jesus said he that hear my word and believeth on him that sent me at eternal life and shall not come into into the Judgment but pass from death into life you're a new creature right then then Paul had met some of these people now listen up in Acts 19 they had them a preacher by up there which was a converted lawyer by the name of Apollos and Apollos was a mighty man in the scriptures and he was proving by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ and did not have the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's not a quote off of there that's mine a poish didn't have the baptism all right we talk about a Polish let's see 365 all right pull up the next one really that's 367 this is continuation reading in questions and answers okay 1957 now watch apoll through the word was proving by the word faith comes by hearing hearing of the word he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life get it apoll by the word was Prov it and these were Christians they were followers disciples if you remember something ke going there and brother dick and I used to talk about this they were disciples until the day of Pentecost then they were Apostles that's the difference because one time he didn't have it the other time he was possessed and Pa was Pro my the word that Jesus of Christ and they had great joy receive the word yet knowing only the baptism of John Paul passed through the upper coast of Ephesus he finds these disciples he said have you received the Holy Ghost you have believe see now when you believe Jesus said you have eternal life that's the new birth that's your conversion changing but the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the power of God that you're baptized into and are subject to these nine spiritual gifts to work through you such as preaching Evangelical Apostles pastors prophets and all the gifts of the body come into this when you you're baptized into this body and remember brother said preacher don't have a right to preach unless you got the baptism ghost and that doesn't that doesn't make you any more a Christian it just sets you positionally in a place to be a ministering spirit in the Church of the Living God now you get it going down to the next one and they asked him a question this is continuation of reading okay at that time we see the new birth that just Tak place is that when okay wrong with the computer the computer got computed okay I can read it from up here let get it back up where we at okay I'll read from here he said that's what they want to know words they said at the time you receive the new birth this takes place is that because they just the question was by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body that's correct 1 Corinthians 12 would give the answer to that all right at that time we receive the new birth this takes place is that when now that's what they want to know yes by one Spirit no no by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body see that isn't when the new birth begin begins I love that one the new birth begins when you believe on the Lord Jesus the new birth begins when you believe on the Lord Jesus n n there is not one thing listen what can you do besides believe what more can you do what can you do about it anymore what can you do about it anymore than just believe it tell me one thing thing you can do there's not one thing you you can do outside of believing now if anything prove comes outside of your believing it isn't an act of it isn't an act of your own it's an act of God okay and he finishes up down on the bottom I guess we're on it because that's 373 come on down and this just said it at the bottom the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a different act from the new birth one is a birth one is a baptism one brings you eternal life other one gives you power gives power into eternal life so see to operate now you got it okay all right sounds confused he done it okay they can pull this up they want to and start off the number nine and then all just SC across it try to save a little bit of time the Pentecostal message was the last message with justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost the last three messages of the last three messages the life Street Church ages forms a complete birth he's talking about just like a woman when they kill Jesus At The Cross the substance come from his body to make up the new to make up the the the birth they struck his sight blood and water came out and what blood and water two of them and into thy hands I Comm in my spirit three what came from his body was water blood spirit right that's what it took to make it what a blood and spirit it was in his body that would constitute that next one see not there with a Shu paragraph 48 there is also three in perfection of the steps of Grace to the church justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost that consists of the new birth just like a natural birth is typed by it which a woman giving birth to a child first think un water blood life okay demonology 53 jumping from 65 backward to show he's teaching the same thing 53 demonology 1112 E8 or instance like this when Jesus died at Calvary now me what elements come from his body water blood and spirit is that right now any Minister any believer knows that that's what constitutes the new birth is that right that constitutes the new birth St John 7:5 there are three that by record of water blood and spirit and they pierc hiside water and blood came out he said into thy hands I commend my spirit those elements went from his body and it takes those same elements to bring you to his you to his body that constitutes the new birth he goes on to what constitutes the natural birth getting these out of the way where we can just say it look at the last one um Jehovah G 1961 312 e58 and so is the church in Christ God never said just go make any organization call it so and so go educate them this he took his own son and from his heart three elements come from his body excuse me sister I want to make a point in a natural birth what is the first thing happens in a normal birth water next blood what is next life that's the same thing that constitutes the new birth what was the thing come out of Jesus's side water blood and in thy hands I commend my spirit St John or 1 John 5:7 there are three that by record in heav heav the Father the word which was the Son and the Holy Ghost these three are one you can't have the father without having a son you can't have the son without having the Holy Ghost these three are one amen all right get the quotes out of the way we started up on one end of it come all the way through it sound like odd quotes R said you New Birth begins when you believe justification is when you believe he says you have eternal life okay like the prophet says you die right there if Judas isar had have died the time that he believed the Lord Jesus he would have been all right but he lost it the prophet of God says you can lose your salvation but now show me where he ever said you can be truly Born Again sealed by the Holy Spirit and lose your salvation I want to see that one I hope this ain't been confusing maybe I can finish it in just a minute that's why I said people think brother rown said this and he said that he said this it all fits together exactly if you put him in order even that the disciples had the new birth before Jesus Christ died even that Apollos who had actually not even heard of the things to receive the Holy Ghost that's right those people receive the new birth to me it's like Luther he received the new body by his believing the difference was Luther was put in the body of Christ with eternal life in the soul he can say well you're def brother around and go ahead cuz you explain it I'll turn it over to you I'll lay these notes out in front of you and let you explain it I believe that when you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ God wres that down As Long as You Keep On Believing everything's okay right that's it it'll carry you through that's right all the way to the baptism of the Holy Ghost all the way up the pyramid today and all the way into the headstone which is love right and all the way to a change of a body if you truly believe right but if you stop believing before you're sealed in yeah in this day justification don't seal you in the body right sanctification don't seal you in the body you said well brother I just saiding that the Holy Ghost is for power yeah cuz that's why the scripture said after the Holy Ghost has come upon you am I right right you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost right so the Holy Ghost came upon the disciples now listen and then they receive power cuz that's what the scripture saying you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you after means a period of time there to be placed my in seconds but it's still a period of time they received power they went out witnessing we read they went out preaching see the new birth today is not the baptism of the Holy Ghost neither the new birth today is not justification nor sanctification it is justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost brings you to a New Birth of this age as I read to you it completes the birth because those ages did you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ amen kids I want you to do that adults I want you to do that you that are concerned that's what I want you to do I want you to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and accept him as your savior amen then start reading and studying ask God to forgive you your sins then start believing start reading and studying and let that word drive that unclean Spirit out of you and then the Holy Ghost can come in amen but if you read the the your future home you find brother around said that even though you're sanctified he said that baptism of the Holy Ghost because the scripture calls it baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire that's actual scripture and fire right that's not two things future homie explains it the fire comes before the Holy Ghost to burn out everything is left that's right what's left me and you that's right amen we ain't dead at justification we ain't dead at sanctification amen now is that tying all the messages together from the previous series you're only dead when you die and or burned out to burn out everything in the world you mean we'll never have no more problem nobody didn't say that brother R said when you say that and believe it he said Satan going to point every gun he's got on you that's right so just expect him to do it but you don't have to go help him buy the guns that's right right you know what but you understand what I'm saying the new birth in Luther's age was justification it only required one stage the new birth in Wesley's age was sanctification and justification that required two stages Pentecostal zeusa Street came forth with the baptism we see people are so blinded to say that isusa street was false 464 in the seal book he said no Messenger to the age talking of isusa street he said because the Holy Ghost came himself in a prophet that's not brother Brandon then at the end of the age of quoting as all the others The Messengers will come brother around End of the Age right not at the beginning of Zeus Street you said well I just don't know where I'm at you really have got me confused good you go pray what's the man talking about I don't have no problem with you asking God what am I talking about but you say but Brother D all it is is just you know it's adoption well that's all right but remember you can't adopt anything until it's a child first right you got to be born again you got to be a child of God you got to be in the body not just believing unto then you can start your adoption but the scriptures right the prophet's right amen and God is so honorable and sweet to do that for us to put us to the place that he knew Luther wouldn't never come on no further he knew Wesley couldn't come any further he knew isusa Street couldn't come any further amen he knew you and I couldn't come any further until he sent us a prophet what a wonderful day that we have that you shall know the truth right and the truth shall set you free that's right you believe unto eternal life but when you receive that genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost which is justification Sanic baptism of the Holy Ghost you now have eternal life you're not believing unto amen you have eternal life in the soul what we need is eternal life in these bodies right right and that's the work of the Holy Spirit to come in our day are the stages to be done the future home but just remember the prophet said I never change from a boy he said I taught three processes well then when it sounds like he was teaching other processes those processes must fit into what he was teaching on the future home believing unto salvation is wonderful but you're not in the body of Christ until you receive that new birth of justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and put you in the body of Christ cuz that's the age of we living cuz those disciples couldn't come into the body of Christ until Jesus Christ died gave his life and then when the life came back upon them they were confessing him as their savior they were Sanctified right and the prophet said they had eternal life that's fine but you better believe and listen to what I was saying cuz you can take what you want to but Judas is carot was walking right in that same place until he denied the Lord Jesus and when he denied him he went back the other way because the unclean Spirit came back into Judas right sure did that was what caused him to not read your Bible he said he was in the upper room read the Bible if you want to turn to it read it he said that the Spirit came in Judas right and he went out that's right the devil entered into him amen that's right did it was nothing wrong with Judas right until he let the devil come back right right Jesus had drove that devil out of him right by the word amen but he let it come back right when he did he just he denied the Lord Jesus Mr just don't get in that place and let that happen to you and I because of some thought or concept that we have did we let that unclean Spirit come back into us and remember the whole thing was it'll be religious and we'll still think we're Christians and we'll still be doing things and you can still be casting out devils and Healing The Sick Lord says and already lost cuz when they come to him they said what we done these things he said depart from me I never knew you exactly right none of you didn't know them he never had an experience of Salvation in their soul right they had to be out toing amen what is the new word Brother D justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then we would do somebody is going to complete all things and walk right into a change of the body right and walk off this Earth then the world world can follow it do you realize that you know see you get started and you hard to quit come on brother you realize that we must go through justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost to be in the body then we must go through the stages of the seals and the opening of the word the mysteries of justification sanctification the baptism of Holy Ghost until these bodies are changed and you know when these bodies are changed the world has got to follow us it's got to go into eternal life amen why because we come out of it it's going to follow us thank you Jesus listen to what I've said over and over I know I leave loopholes and what hours to preach 40 something years I've been preaching it with a new birth I like what the prophet said he said that new birth begin when you believe just keep home believing they said all Abraham could do was believe he said that's exactly right we read there about it not about Abraham but he said that's exactly right he said all you can do is believe but he said what did God do for Abraham did God accepted amen he'll accept you and I and give us a baptism of the Holy Ghost then he can say this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell and it'll come out to the bases of what hear you him it'll be finished what do we got for let's stand maybe we didn't make it much over 94 in red book everybody knows it we just got that don't need to put are we already on another okay we already I'm sorry anybody have start by believeing start by accepting me as your savior start by repenting of your sins start by straightening

Jesus Christ praise God we condemn this a fever in Lord God by your stripes we love you thank you so just let all let everything be well because we believe you we know that we don't have the power forever but we have permission to God we just lay our hands showing that we believe and we condemn that Dem in Jesus name the like me I was but now I'm found but now I see was great let all my heart and BR my how preious is that gra through I already his gra has come he and we there sh God PR you praise God God God God God pra God pra God an understanding godur God we know take care she was walking one day living what I'll probably do what I'll probably do next and you know doing this to tr TR this and you just write it down you know about your experience or whatever you want and I'll be glad to read it but just try to tell you what the baptism of the Holy Ghost is right you said when I shouted well that's CZ you talking those things you he was around somebody else that done those things what if you done that and didn't get it the prophet said spoke in tongues he said didn't get it what is the you birn see what is it what about the man that I was telling the sister that picked up a card and read it where will you spend eternity he went from there to all of the great evangelist getting to pray for him to receive the New Birth when he come to the Prophet The Prophet looked at him and said I there when you turned around he didn't say that right there that he was just shattered with the Holy Ghost and feel in the body into he said right there he said you mean I've had it all along you see we've been taught that you've got to have some form right brother Brown said the mystery in the end time was to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost without a sensation now he did not say without an experience he said without a sensation that's why everybody can be different part but I believe the new birth and everybody is the same I don't know what you done that's up to you you may shouted cried seen Vision but it's all One new birth so it can't be all of these things that everybody's taught it reason I saying that because brother Tom that preached Mercy the other day he may be preaching Wednesday I'm not certain cuz he's coming back through so maybe if not then I'll take this up Wednesday we'll do it but you know he's coming back through from up North Canada and coming back in Tuesday so you know we may be having that Wednesday so let's be left up to whatever okay all M's clear can I say something yeah go ahead I tell you you know a lot of people say well you're negative and what have like it had a brother tell me the other day how you knew you had the baptism Holy Ghost he says you lay hands on the sick and they're healed you cast out L and the scripture come to my mind Lord Lord we cast out demons in your name we done these money wonderful works in your name see and to me when things like that happens that's evidence that something's taking place and you can have two things you can have a baptism of holy ghost or you can have an anointing and you got to tell the difference between the two exactly and I think today that chrisan as far as I know it the majority is an an only because that's what it's been taught right it's been taught you got to do this got to do that but why can't we just accept What God Says anybody else before we go de Heavenly Father we thank you for this day in your love unto us thank you for your word and I pray that what I've said has been worthy of being said I tried the best I could do in the human realm Lord to speak about the things cuz it's just telling about my own life want to believe and Lord truly we can believe on you before you come and accept us cuz we have to do that it's not a choice we have to accept you first and then you can accept us we ask you to just help us give us understanding ears that we may hear give us the light of your love in our hearts go with us as we travel home take care of everybody give a safe journey and just let your light shine in each heart and life in Jesus name amen you dis me when batt over yes we wear yes we wear we in where where where around wi and Shining
