[42:23] other than this commando simply why I am
[42:26] a loser
[42:27] and why you should lead to people get to
[42:30] the mid 80s in a minute so here is
[42:33] speaking about some vessels we have this
[42:48] treasure this treasure in earthen vessel
[42:52] he said Pendleton it was destitute Solo
[42:53] in Russells over what's right get this
[42:56] one amen because we see that out of
[43:07] darkness God said let there be light
[43:34] Costello's there was life I've yet you
[43:39] realize that when that light in that
[43:42] verse cuenta que sera sera sequel that's
[43:45] not the Sun it was I'm sorry that's not
[43:48] the moon but no no that is God's like
[43:52] that is the life of God
[43:55] lovey-doveys amen because later on in
[43:58] the scripture in Genesis 1 what could
[44:01] his question in Genesis chapter 1 and 2
[44:13] we see that that God creates mascara
[44:21] spiciest curry Creoles yesterday's so
[44:25] that light at the beginning all right so
[44:50] now you can talk about the Sun although
[45:02] the bride types the moon for the moon on
[45:05] the moon is a that same life do you
[45:44] [Music]
[45:50] is in your life yeah
[46:08] [Music]
[47:05] Holy Spirit inside of you this treasure
[47:28] in earthen vessels
[47:31] [Music]
[48:02] beautiful China in common earthen
[48:51] vessels those vessels that you might buy
[49:00] at Walmart
[49:10] [Music]
[49:16] [Music]
[49:42] [Music]
[49:48] [Applause]
[49:52] [Music]
[50:06] and it's you that's why you should
[50:32] praise the Lord Jesus so if we continue
[50:36] reading here now now watch what he says
[50:38] here in the same verse 7 I mean okay
[50:41] secret look at the reason why he put
[50:45] this light in those vessels reading
[50:50] and this Ghostbusters that the
[50:52] excellency of the power may be of God
[51:05] [Music]
[51:17] you have nothing to do you are not
[51:21] looking for that's the only that's the
[53:35] only but you have to come to him he's
[53:50] not going to force you to serve Him and
[54:05] then to choose him but it's to choose
[54:08] life but as to choose light to let us go
[54:13] ahead or to choose darkness
[54:20] so we see today you know we see the
[54:35] movie looking like he's alive si como si
[55:32] Stewie but now really if you think about
[55:37] it better today
[55:39] you and me should be actually the truth
[55:51] we should be dead to the world
[55:55] mundo and constantly
[56:03] [Music]
[56:05] I said to me after we are the truth
[56:29] [Music]
[56:36] those things out there tonight I believe
[57:06] they're here in this room tonight en
[57:09] esta noche
[57:09] there are walking with the life of God
[57:27] because when God told Moses to make the
[57:31] tabernacle he told him to make
[58:04] [Music]
[58:13] [Music]
[58:32] [Music]
[58:38] so when the children of Israel we're
[58:41] walking around in the wilderness and
[58:47] they were tearing the tabernacle around
[58:53] the b-pawn
[58:55] would see them you know meet up and look
[58:59] at their church amidala see you as you
[59:01] and say mommy is yeah thanks the people
[59:06] of God
[59:09] okay that's their church as I seen this
[59:12] you not knowing you know so you know
[59:17] thank God
[59:31] that was because he doesn't go around he
[1:00:25] doesn't go around with
[1:00:34] [Applause]
[1:00:40] [Music]
[1:01:22] whatever is inside of you mr. caruso we
[1:01:35] see we see that that the tabernacle of
[1:01:40] Moses and the saloon was Kenneth other
[1:01:42] than that it was his you see there was
[1:01:45] that outer court of the other entrance
[1:01:51] all right and then you have to enter in
[1:01:57] order for you to be able to start we're
[1:02:33] always around stone infidelity
[1:02:49] you have today but when the children of
[1:04:24] Israel were in the outer court that was
[1:04:26] equal and that didn't mean that they
[1:04:32] were in the holy place
[1:04:40] it was the same it was said okay there's
[1:05:05] a need to clean myself I need to I
[1:05:55] believe is so many people for example
[1:05:59] when they receive the message of the you
[1:06:02] came for the amen they receive the
[1:06:08] message but I see you only miss liking
[1:06:10] but the message is not in that but
[1:06:12] leaves and so they're they're inside the
[1:06:19] holy place it's an ended up subtle and
[1:06:22] they're eating
[1:06:26] [Music]
[1:06:37] you know but it was when the priest
[1:07:59] [Music]
[1:08:00] already have gone through these other
[1:08:03] steps
[1:08:06] he was back there he was there was a
[1:09:29] part of the original man
[1:09:31] [Music]
[1:09:45] [Music]
[1:09:47] get back in there the children of Israel
[1:10:08] it was going to spoil it was in there to
[1:11:10] show the priests
[1:11:13] and let you know while he was in their
[1:11:19] presence
[1:11:20] what when establish a procession he's
[1:11:24] the same yesterday today
[1:11:27] that's why the man did it change that's
[1:11:32] why the tablets did it change but you

[1:12:09] dry East our coast our stable but God
[1:12:11] Como's is to put that rod inside there
[1:12:16] think about this ominous windows priest

[1:12:34] would see that rod yeah yes I have

[1:12:54] [Music]
[1:13:02] [Music]
[1:13:17] [Music]
[1:13:18] [Applause]
[1:13:22] [Music]
[1:13:31] that's why that's why he wants to make
[1:14:25] you live steady and not just live in the
[1:14:28] holy place you know you've either got
[1:14:30] something but he wants you to live in
[1:14:32] the Holy of Holies where the true
[1:14:39] [Music]
[1:14:47] [Music]
[1:14:51] [Applause]
[1:14:52] [Music]

[1:16:54] may not have temptations no that's much
[1:17:01] greater
[1:17:25] [Music]
[1:18:19] [Applause]
[1:18:24] so if you want to turn with me to first
[1:18:28] Corinthians chapter 1 let's just read
[1:18:35] verse 18
[1:18:50] now that we know asylum was that God
[1:18:54] wants to dwell in your skin a study in
[1:18:58] weak earthen vessels like you and
[1:19:01] Russell 7 that is Como Stadium this is
[1:19:05] part up this is the reason why first
[1:19:12] verse 18 all says for the preaching of
[1:19:15] the Cross is to them that perish
[1:19:18] foolishness but unto us which are saved
[1:19:20] it is the power of God in social policy
[1:19:23] porque la palabra de la Cruz is no coup
[1:19:26] de ellos que severe Parivar was cast
[1:19:29] aside one as to his absolute unity state
[1:19:41] but if you cannot have in reality a new
[1:19:44] token of you are those entities
[1:19:56] preaching to save them that believe that
[1:19:59] you already read that part
[1:20:00] so you see God by preaching and Paul
[1:20:07] calls it the foolishness of preaching
[1:20:13] easy sometimes it's crazy
[1:20:17] to watch a man standing behind this
[1:20:20] pulpit I mean I don't normally that
[1:20:22] would be sweating all over the place
[1:20:29] while you're there and you received
[1:20:33] their showers of blessings
[1:20:45] what time that is
[1:20:47] I was interpreting for brother jewel for
[1:20:50] knee just a leopard on the father a
[1:20:52] mother a Jewish holy how many know who
[1:20:53] brother Drew for nee Pusan Canada the
[1:20:56] motherland what he's he's an evangelist
[1:20:58] from North Carolina he's very she guess
[1:21:06] we know you know me cold and so I was I
[1:21:10] was interpreting for him I was I was
[1:21:12] standing on his left side and always
[1:21:16] kill him brother Joe said something and
[1:21:25] so he looked at he looked at me and he
[1:21:28] turned his head like this yummy he did
[1:21:32] his sweat even though but but that is
[1:21:59] what God chose
[1:22:04] his work by the kid and be a father to
[1:22:09] his people assume a man for the people
[1:22:18] of God it's something glorious because
[1:22:30] if it's of God verse 25 slinky Cinco
[1:22:43] population because the foolishness of
[1:22:45] God is wiser than drug cartels from
[1:24:15] Mexico I lived through drugs back in the
[1:24:20] 80s in Colombia Joey be paralyzed and
[1:24:25] you must call us believers should not be
[1:24:32] worried about those things because
[1:24:54] quality this party is not changed this
[1:25:30] body still needs to be redeemed a staple
[1:25:33] of Dietetics every means my inner man is
[1:25:35] redeemed me oh my my soul
[1:25:58] [Applause]
[1:25:59] [Music]
[1:26:39] so all right so Paul could say your
[1:26:44] first 27
[1:26:46] C is equal to the wise Tino Tino Tino
[1:26:56] narrowly mundo para la vida mundo is to

[1:27:37] instead found that power amen
[1:27:42] and base things of the world verse 28
[1:27:46] and base things of the world and things
[1:27:48] which are despised but she put these you

[1:27:53] know memos but as yellow have God chosen
[1:27:56] yea and things which are not to bring to
[1:27:59] nought things that are let's go here
[1:28:01] with us you know can know it but okay
[1:28:05] watch verse 29 in there she couldn t
[1:28:08] know that no flesh should glory in his
[1:28:10] presence
[1:28:11] I think they can not either say say that
[1:28:14] is super sensitive God doesn't want you
[1:28:17] to glory with your own flesh with what
[1:28:20] you can do to say say say Modi of
[1:28:24] Singapore know who stick what that's it
[1:28:26] God doesn't want you to glory
[1:28:41] if God
[1:29:01] [Music]
[1:29:11] [Music]
[1:29:17] very self-centered what do you think
[1:29:43] they call it you know back then when
[1:29:45] they have my space my space
[1:29:48] yeah I'll just continue in my space get
[1:29:50] a case me espacio it's my space I told
[1:30:01] us to use because it's me and this
[1:30:04] device okay we don't use them getting
[1:30:11] robbed in Berlin
[1:30:30] because your husband you serve your
[1:31:26] children on Facebook
[1:31:41] [Applause]
[1:31:57] you know
[1:32:12] [Applause]
[1:32:16] [Music]
[1:33:26] [Music]
[1:33:28] [Applause]
[1:33:35] so this is in Christ Jesus who glory in
[1:34:27] the Lord
[1:35:12] [Music]
[1:35:27] [Music]
[1:35:42] [Music]
[1:35:48] [Music]
[1:35:58] [Music]
[1:35:59] and capitalist verse 24 there see what
[1:36:09] he says equal to the sea cruise if any
[1:36:22] man will come after me
[1:36:24] look at him and pause the me let him
[1:36:27] deny himself
[1:36:30] and take up his cross and follow me
[1:36:33] he don't miss a goose you see that or
[1:36:35] whosoever will save his life shall lose
[1:36:38] it
[1:36:39] por que todo in que quieres I gotta
[1:36:41] sweeten up their data now watch and
[1:36:45] whosoever will lose his life for my sake
[1:36:49] shall find it don't worry kid yeah
[1:36:51] that's will be the poor cow said I mean
[1:36:53] yeah so that's the reason why I want to
[1:36:57] be a loser in this Jesus was not talking
[1:37:06] about losing or you know hurting
[1:37:11] yourself or killing yourself or anything
[1:37:13] like that it's just all done till
[1:37:15] they've been in the bundle stick no but
[1:37:20] he was talking about sacrificing
[1:37:23] yourself that if you can sacrifice your
[1:37:29] own self she's tasted let's at least be
[1:37:32] active in Tennessee me small to let him
[1:37:35] work at you but I can't our Houston amen
[1:37:38] then that means you're losing your
[1:37:41] identity your life and those acoustic
[1:37:43] stuff for dinner su vida and you're
[1:37:46] taking his identity's system honest with
[1:37:49] ya a man with his identity :
[1:37:53] then all things are possible that's the
[1:38:02] reason why
[1:38:09] the Potter when he was on the potter's
[1:38:13] wheel said one day I decided upon a star
[1:38:16] whether they now believe is in Jeremiah
[1:38:20] get okay that headache yes and God told
[1:38:22] your mind to go to the potter's house
[1:38:26] yesterday
[1:38:28] and to and to see this part making this
[1:38:31] this jar of clay he gave me that stuff I
[1:38:34] don't know instead of all day now
[1:38:38] st. in the Potters hand he has to plea
