[32:29] bless you brother Wade and sister June
[32:30] God bless you amen is that how you
[32:32] wanted me to say
[32:35] that
[32:37] about oh okay
[32:40] amen amen he forgot I got the last word
[32:44] oh wait he gets the end of the
[32:48] service 1 Corinthians
[32:51] chapter in verse number
[32:53] one okay 1 Corinthians 15 verse1 amen
[32:57] and Paul here writing says now moreover
[33:00] Brethren I declare unto you the gospel
[33:02] which I preached unto you which also ye
[33:05] have received and wherein you stand
[33:08] which also ye are saved if you keep in
[33:10] memory what I have preached unto you
[33:13] unless you have believed in vain now
[33:15] watch what he says here he says for I
[33:18] delivered unto you first of all that
[33:20] which I also received how that Christ
[33:23] died for our sins according to the
[33:25] scripture and that he was buried and
[33:27] that he rose again the third day
[33:30] according to the scripture now I want
[33:33] you to watch here Paul is speaking of
[33:35] the life of our Lord Jesus and what is
[33:37] so astounding to me is everything that
[33:40] he did he did it according to the
[33:42] scripture amen he was born according to
[33:45] the scripture he lived he died and he
[33:47] rose again amen according to the
[33:50] scripture now if we could turn to St
[33:52] Luke chapter
[33:53] 24 St Luke chapter 24 it's a very very
[33:58] familiar reading uh to us as Believers
[34:00] brother Rand will use this many many
[34:02] times in his scriptures and in the
[34:04] sermons that he' preach about when their
[34:06] eyes were open scriptures and sermons on
[34:08] the resurrection in St Luke chapter
[34:11] 24 and I want to begin reading uh in the
[34:14] 30th verse and it came to pass as he
[34:17] said at meat with him he took bread and
[34:19] blessed it and break and gave to them
[34:23] now watch this and their eyes were open
[34:26] and they knew him
[34:28] and he vanished out of their sight and
[34:30] they said one to another now did not our
[34:33] heart burn within us while he talked
[34:36] with us by the way now watch here and
[34:38] while he opened to us the scriptures so
[34:42] he was born Liv died and buried and rose
[34:45] again according to the scripture but
[34:47] here he's actually walking with him as
[34:50] the resurrected Lord but he's still
[34:53] referring back to the scripture now we
[34:57] believe that word speaks of the
[34:58] bridegroom right well if it speaks of
[35:00] the bridegroom it must also speak of the
[35:02] bride and St John chapter 14 let's turn
[35:05] there and then I'll give you our subject
[35:07] and let you be seated St John chapter
[35:09] 14 and verse number 19 amen a good
[35:13] feeling in the house of God tonight amen
[35:15] St John 14 and 19 yet a little while and
[35:20] the world seeth me no more but ye see me
[35:24] now watch here because I live he shall
[35:28] live also brother BR stopped and said
[35:31] see he was speaking to his wife amen
[35:34] because I live ye shall live also we ask
[35:37] the Lord this evening to add the
[35:38] blessing to the reading of his word as
[35:40] you can have your seats here this
[35:41] afternoon I want to by the help of the
[35:43] Lord for just a few moments if I could
[35:46] and if I would take a title tonight I
[35:48] want to talk to you here on this thought
[35:50] of walking in the precious light of his
[35:53] resurrection amen walking in the
[35:55] precious light of his resurrection now
[35:57] now you all uh know tonight that we have
[36:00] been sent amen a wonderful message amen
[36:03] amen we we believe that the message of
[36:05] the hour amen is the the truth and it is
[36:08] the revelation of Jesus Christ and as we
[36:11] studyed this I was just reading some
[36:13] quotes here and I want to if I can
[36:15] tonight to just lay a foundation here in
[36:18] 1958 brother br's preaching a sermon I
[36:20] know my redeemer liveth he said now dear
[36:23] God we are grateful this morning to be
[36:26] the people that is called called by thy
[36:28] name he said we are so glad that we do
[36:30] not have to just imagine anymore of a
[36:33] great resurrection that is to come he
[36:35] said because it has become a reality to
[36:39] us as we read it in thy word and see
[36:42] that thou H has promised this and filled
[36:45] it within our souls amen That Jesus
[36:48] Lives oh we are thinking this morning
[36:50] the many heartaches it's been in life
[36:53] and the many sadnesses that we went
[36:54] through the experiences that is torness
[36:57] and thrown us to the wind of the Earth
[36:59] how we have buried our loved ones and we
[37:01] have mourned at the grave and our soul
[37:03] seems to almost perish within us amen
[37:06] but we can think of today oh what it
[37:09] means that Jesus raised from the dead he
[37:12] spoiled every Power of the enemy when he
[37:15] rose up amen triumphant he took all the
[37:18] Shadows away he says and now we walk in
[37:22] the precious light of his resurrection
[37:24] amen that's a very powerful thing to me
[37:26] that we are no longer looking amen just
[37:29] for a resurrection in the future amen or
[37:32] this is some future event or something
[37:34] that's going to happen or it's a million
[37:36] miles away from us amen but we can say
[37:38] as job said I know amen that my redeemer
[37:41] liveth and at the last day amen he will
[37:44] stand upon on the earth or after the
[37:46] skin worms destroy this body amen yet in
[37:49] my flesh shall I see God said now he
[37:52] seen the resurrection would be brought
[37:54] about by a man someday and the sin
[37:57] question would be settled when that
[37:58] righteous one the Son of God Amen came
[38:01] to die for sinners now there was no man
[38:04] on the earth at that time or no man s
[38:07] amen they could ever Bridge the way
[38:09] between a holy God Amen and a sinful man
[38:13] he said but job here 4,000 years before
[38:16] his coming amen he saw his death his
[38:19] burial and his resurrection amen and his
[38:22] justification that come by the
[38:24] resurrection now watch and the absolute
[38:27] guarantee of the resurrection of the
[38:29] believer amen now see it is a comfort to
[38:32] know that these things are true amen and
[38:35] that it's not a fiction story so job
[38:38] amen 4,000 years before amen our Lord
[38:41] was ever born or was ever slain upon a
[38:44] cross amen he saw that he would be the
[38:46] one who would bridge the gap amen or
[38:49] would be the one that would bring
[38:50] reconciliation between a holy God Amen
[38:53] and a sinful man and he would be the one
[38:55] that would also bring a Resurrection to
[38:58] the church but now watch job did not
[39:00] just see his resurrection he said but he
[39:03] saw an absolute guarantee amen of the
[39:06] resurrection of the believer now when
[39:08] you start talking about Resurrection you
[39:10] automatically know amen that we're
[39:12] speaking about the gospel right amen and
[39:14] the gospel amen is the birth it is the
[39:17] life the death the burial amen and the
[39:19] resurrection of Jesus Christ amen and
[39:22] the promise of his second coming right
[39:25] amen and the prophet of God will say
[39:27] this he said now see there is no other
[39:29] gospel he said if there is another
[39:31] gospel as Paul spoke to one of the
[39:33] groups I said I'm so surprised that you
[39:35] turned Amen to another gospel which
[39:38] there is no other amen but a make belief
[39:41] gospel Amen to a denominational fiction
[39:44] turning from that good news amen so the
[39:47] gospel is the announcement of the good
[39:49] news amen that Jesus was born amen that
[39:53] he lived that he died that he was buried
[39:55] and that he rose again amen but don't
[39:57] stop there that he's coming a second
[39:59] time amen and you are a part of that
[40:02] Resurrection amen because I live ye live
[40:05] also and I live in you amen and the
[40:07] works that I do amen I will identify
[40:10] myself in you he says now what a message
[40:13] no wonder we've had a dark world of
[40:15] theology listen but in the evening time
[40:19] amen there shall come light again we've
[40:22] had a world of dark theology amen but in
[40:25] the evening time there shall come light
[40:27] again listen there will be a
[40:29] resurrection in the evening time it
[40:32] shall be light about the evening time
[40:34] again it is the rising of the sun
[40:36] because I live ye live also speaking to
[40:38] his wife amen what a resurrection that
[40:42] that was amen and what a resurrection
[40:45] this is see amen what a resurrection
[40:48] that was amen but what a resurrection
[40:51] this is Amen to be quickened from the
[40:53] dead to be made alive in Christ Jesus
[40:56] amen by God's quickening
[40:59] power my he was waved to them the word
[41:03] which he was was waved back to them on
[41:04] the day of Pentecost he said the word
[41:07] made manifest now and as I say it is to
[41:10] be waved again in the last day so there
[41:13] is a promise that the word of God Amen
[41:17] would be restored to the church amen and
[41:19] if it be restored then it would be wave
[41:21] to the church let me say this as gospel
[41:24] preachers amen we are not waving a
[41:26] fiction story amen we are not waving
[41:28] some man's idea before you or waving
[41:31] some tradition or some Dogma amen but we
[41:33] are waving the word of God and the
[41:36] prophet of God said now this is not a
[41:37] fiction amen this is the Bible it's
[41:40] God's truth it's his promise he said
[41:42] I've tried it and tested it and I know
[41:45] you can take God's word and he will make
[41:47] it right with you he will bring it to
[41:50] pass now we know by a prophet's teaching
[41:53] amen that there would be an absolute in
[41:55] this generation right amen and he would
[41:57] take time to identify amen what Webster
[42:00] said an absolute was he said see it's
[42:03] perfect in itself it's Unlimited in its
[42:05] power it is primarily an ultimate see it
[42:08] is Unlimited in its power it is perfect
[42:11] in itself amen and it really is an
[42:14] ultimate amen so an absolute is perfect
[42:18] it's an ultimate it's unlimited see he
[42:21] said therefore I think everybody amen
[42:23] should have an absolute how many agree
[42:26] amen that every body should have an
[42:28] absolute he said every great achievement
[42:31] that's ever been achieved there has been
[42:33] an absolute behind it no matter what it
[42:36] was it's had an absolute behind it and
[42:39] every person in order to achieve
[42:40] something has to First have the absolute
[42:43] he said now that's the final wind back
[42:45] through this that through the other amen
[42:47] till you come back to that absolute or
[42:49] the amen amen or the ultimate see you've
[42:52] got to have something Amen to tie to in
[42:55] other words amen it's the final tying
[42:59] post now watch what a prophet says it's
[43:02] somewhere it might wind amen through
[43:04] many different things till it gets to
[43:06] that TI poost amen but there is an amen
[43:09] to all of it see you cannot go through
[43:11] life without having an absolute now I
[43:14] also took time to look up amen that word
[43:17] guarantee because the prophet of God
[43:19] said amen that job seem the absolute
[43:22] guarantee of the resurrection of the
[43:24] believer that word guarantee is a very
[43:26] powerful for word it means a formal
[43:29] promise or Assurance amen that is
[43:31] typically in writing yep now that's
[43:34] that's a very powerful thing it is a
[43:37] formal promise or assurance that is
[43:39] typically in writing and it is that
[43:41] certain conditions will be fulfilled
[43:44] listen it is something that gives a
[43:47] certainty of an outcome amen so if you
[43:50] have a guarantee amen it's not something
[43:53] that's just on somebody's mind or it's
[43:55] on somebody's heart amen but it's
[43:57] actually been put into writing amen
[44:00] therefore nobody has a right to change
[44:02] it amen nobody has a right to say well
[44:05] it should be this way or well it should
[44:07] be that way now come on church amen I'll
[44:09] just say this the only absolute
[44:11] guarantee that I know of Amen is the
[44:13] revealed word of God that has been
[44:16] brought to this generation by a
[44:18] Vindicated Prophet amen listen it was
[44:20] written in the Bible amen and it was
[44:23] interpreted in 100 or or 1,200 books and
[44:27] tapes but let me say this don't just
[44:29] leave it in the Bible and don't just
[44:31] leave it on the books and tapes amen but
[44:34] now that absolute guarantee has been
[44:37] manifested in the flesh of the Bride of
[44:39] Jesus Christ that's why Paul would say
[44:42] Amen that you are a written epistle amen
[44:44] written in our hearts and you are known
[44:47] and read of all men for as much as you
[44:49] are manifestly declared to be the
[44:51] Epistle of Christ ministered by US
[44:54] Written not with think but with the
[44:55] spirit of the Living God
[44:57] amen not in tables of stone amen but in
[45:00] fleshly tables of the heart again in
[45:03] Hebrews 8:10 for this Covenant I will
[45:05] make with the house of Israel after
[45:07] those days sayith the Lord look I will
[45:10] put my laws in their mind amen and I
[45:13] will write them in their hearts and I
[45:15] will be to them a God and they shall be
[45:18] to me a people what is this speaking of
[45:21] it is speaking of a generation that will
[45:24] receive the absolute guarantee amen but
[45:27] will not be diluted it will not be
[45:29] watered down it will not be hybridized
[45:32] amen but it will stand and it's full
[45:33] Authority and it will stand in its full
[45:36] effect listen I say thank God Amen that
[45:39] we have got a written guarantee amen and
[45:42] we got our books and we got our tapes
[45:44] and we don't have to take what some man
[45:46] thinks about something that a prophet
[45:47] taugh we can go back to the written
[45:50] guarantee and we can see exactly the way
[45:52] a prophet taught it and that gives us
[45:54] the right to say it exactly the way he
[45:57] called it in the face of every
[45:58] unbelieving devil listen the prophet of
[46:00] God made it very plain he said therefore
[46:03] the man's spirit is Blended out Y come
[46:06] on now now there's a very important key
[46:08] the man's spirit is Blended out amen and
[46:11] God comes in and takes over he said then
[46:13] they got Fellowship one with another and
[46:16] the Very God that created the heavens
[46:18] and the Earth that wrote his word dwells
[46:21] in you listen and you'll believe
[46:23] everything that God wrote is the truth
[46:25] somebody say well I got the the Holy
[46:27] Ghost but I don't believe that scripture
[46:29] well you don't have the Holy Ghost to
[46:30] the Bible amen because it was a promise
[46:33] that the Holy Ghost amen would come into
[46:35] the flesh redeem flesh and would cause
[46:38] you to believe everything that was
[46:40] written in the word of God now we all
[46:42] have to agree tonight that the Bible is
[46:44] more than your grandma's Almanac amen
[46:47] it's more than just a history lesson or
[46:49] it's more than just some educated
[46:50] something the Bible is wrote by
[46:53] inspiration Paul said it this way he
[46:55] said all scripture is given by
[46:58] inspiration of God and it is profitable
[47:00] for Doctrine for reproof and for
[47:03] correction for instruction and
[47:04] righteousness he said now listen modern
[47:07] events make clear he said the Bible is
[47:09] the word of God Amen it is wrote by God
[47:12] himself amen through the lips and
[47:14] instrumentality of man listen God can
[47:17] write himself God can speak himself God
[47:20] can do what he wants to amen but he
[47:23] chose man to do it because the man that
[47:25] wrote it Is A Part of God listen the man
[47:29] that wrote it is a part of God he said
[47:31] the man didn't even know what they were
[47:33] writing in their own human thinking they
[47:36] might disagree with it amen but they
[47:38] wrote it they couldn't help but write it
[47:40] amen because God moved their hands he
[47:43] moved their eyes in the vision they
[47:45] could say nothing but they were looking
[47:46] at they could speak nothing listen cuz
[47:49] he had full control of their tongue of
[47:52] their finger every organ of the body
[47:54] amen was in full Sway With God no wonder
[47:57] the Bible said they were Gods amen they
[47:59] were a part of God listen that's how
[48:02] much God was looking over the word amen
[48:05] being wrote to you amen if he looked
[48:07] over that much being wrote amen then how
[48:10] much more did he look over when it come
[48:12] time to interpret the things that have
[48:14] been
[48:14] wrote amen amen I tell you it gets it
[48:18] gets in you if you really get to looking
[48:19] at it amen that God so took care of the
[48:24] writing of his word that there would not
[48:26] be one idea of a man involved amen there
[48:29] would not be one there would not be one
[48:31] uh uh there would not be one thing
[48:32] brother B said like this he said see not
[48:35] even the punctuation amen would be out
[48:37] of place amen now think about this if
[48:39] Moses was writing or Abraham was writing
[48:42] or some of those were writing amen now
[48:43] listen they had to write about their
[48:45] mistakes right amen they had to write
[48:47] about their failures and their blunders
[48:49] and their shortcomings listen they might
[48:51] have not wanted to write about it amen
[48:53] but brother Bob they didn't have a
[48:54] choice amen because they were in the
[48:57] full sway of the author so they had to
[49:00] write what he was moving them to write
[49:02] listen I'll say it this way we have seen
[49:04] a direct manifestation of that Amen in
[49:07] our age when a prophet stood there and
[49:09] he said listen I'm God's mouthpiece I'm
[49:11] God's voice to you amen y'all remember
[49:14] that I'm God's voice to you right amen
[49:18] he stops brother Aaron he says it like
[49:20] this he says now I shouldn't have said
[49:22] that he said I felt you kind of resent
[49:24] that he said but I'm God's voice to you
[49:28] he said but that time was under
[49:30] inspiration he said it wasn't me it was
[49:33] him in other words he didn't want to say
[49:36] Amen but God wanted somebody to say Amen
[49:39] you're my voice on the earth when those
[49:41] prophets were writing these scriptures
[49:43] what they were doing is they were
[49:45] writing prophecy amen of the coming
[49:47] Messiah which was none other than our
[49:50] Lord Jesus Christ now in St John 5 and
[49:53] verse 46 I love the Bible Amen in St
[49:56] John 5 46 Jesus said this he said for
[49:59] had you beli Moses amen you would have
[50:01] believed me for he wrote of me look at
[50:04] this word wrote it means to describe to
[50:06] write to commit to writing amen things
[50:09] not to be forgotten it means to record I
[50:12] love this it means it's used of those
[50:14] things which stand written in the sacred
[50:17] books of the Old Testament it means to
[50:19] write Amen to give information or
[50:21] Direction so that when something is
[50:24] coming it will not be missed amen now
[50:26] watch here in verse 47 and Jesus looks
[50:29] at him and he says but if you believe
[50:31] not his writings amen then how shall you
[50:34] believe my words amen now look Jesus
[50:37] amen was the manifestation of the
[50:40] writings amen that Moses wrote about
[50:43] Amen brother said like this he said this
[50:45] baby down here illegitimate birth in a
[50:47] cow stable amen how could that be amen
[50:50] this guy didn't go to any school he had
[50:52] no credentials he had no Fellowship card
[50:54] he didn't belong to any organization
[50:56] amen how could this be anything but it
[50:59] was he said see they failed to see it
[51:02] but Jesus looks at them I love this and
[51:05] he says listen the works I do amen they
[51:07] testify of me search the scripture amen
[51:10] for in them you think you have eternal
[51:13] life amen and they are they that testify
[51:16] amen they tell you who I am listen what
[51:19] he says he says they are my testimony
[51:22] amen so Jesus's testimony amen was
[51:26] scripture if you believe Moses you would
[51:28] believe me amen because he wrote of me
[51:32] so in other words they've got the
[51:33] Scrolls amen and they're reading about
[51:36] these things amen and here's Jesus and
[51:38] they're saying but you're not the one he
[51:40] said but I'm the one that Moses was
[51:42] writing about in other words said like
[51:46] this he said they were so dark and still
[51:49] they couldn't see it look he didn't say
[51:51] it was dark he didn't say around them
[51:53] was dark he said they were so dark amen
[51:57] I wonder if that couldn't repeat amen
[51:59] it's prophesied to you know amen you say
[52:01] in this day oh yes now what was Jesus
[52:05] amen Jesus was the scriptural light of
[52:08] the day amen the prophet of God said
[52:11] Jesus was all the inspired prophets
[52:13] testimonies all their prophecy amen was
[52:16] brought to light in his age that had
[52:18] been prophesied for his age he says he
[52:21] lit up every candle of word amen that
[52:24] was in the Bible that was prophesying
[52:26] out of him in Isaiah 7 a virgin shall
[52:29] conceive and she did in Isaiah 9 his
[52:32] name Shall be Called counselor the
[52:34] Prince of Peace the Mighty God the
[52:35] Everlasting father and he was amen the
[52:38] eyes of the blind shall see and they did
[52:41] he said everything that was prophesied
[52:43] of him amen it happened when he come on
[52:46] the earth in other words when Jesus came
[52:50] Amen on the earth he brought a
[52:52] resurrection Amen to those scriptures
[52:54] that had been Wroten about him amen but
[52:57] he didn't bring it by theology church he
[52:59] didn't bring it by education he didn't
[53:01] bring it by intellectualism he brought
[53:04] it by manifestation oh Church of the
[53:06] Living God he was the manifested word
[53:09] amen there was a time that God thought
[53:12] about his word amen that God spoke his
[53:14] word that God had his word wrote amen
[53:17] but now was the time the thought word
[53:19] amen the spoken word the written word
[53:22] would become the manifested word and
[53:24] when it become the manifested word it
[53:26] would be Vindicated amen by the
[53:29] interpretation of the one who wrote it
[53:32] my goodness amen the scriptures cannot
[53:34] be broken amen the word must be
[53:36] fulfilled that's why Jesus said amen
[53:39] that heaven and Earth shall pass away
[53:41] amen but my words amen shall not pass
[53:44] away he said and God's word is so real

[57:05] more than a book to debate about amen
[57:07] it's more than a book to just look at
[57:09] ever now and again amen but this Bible
[57:11] is full of promises and let me say
[57:14] they're not man-made promises amen

[57:41] light amen not Cosmic light amen not
[57:45] man-made light or denominational light
[57:47] amen I'm thankful for the light that was
[57:49] prophesied amen from the Bible which
[57:52] I'll call Bible light because it's what
[57:54] a prophet called it in Zechariah 146 he
[57:57] said now listen it shall come to pass in
[57:59] that day so this is a prophecy
[58:01] right it shall come to pass in that day
[58:04] that the light shall not be clear nor
[58:07] dark but it shall be one day which shall
[58:09] be known to the Lord not day or night
[58:13] but it shall come to pass that at
[58:15] evening time it shall be light now look
[58:19] here in modern events he said the the
[58:21] evening light promised by the prophet of
[58:23] God in zecharias 14:7 May again open the
[58:27] true believer's eyes Amen to the events
[58:30] that's taking place today amen that's
[58:33] proved by the prophecies that we're at
[58:35] the end time listen Jesus is coming
[58:38] another paragraph but the prophet said
[58:41] it shall be light again about the
[58:43] evening time the s o n The Sun Will peep
[58:46] out again it shall be light amen what
[58:49] the same son s o n listen that was
[58:53] revealed in flesh at the morning time
[58:56] back there will be revealed again in the
[58:59] evening time amen can I say it to you
[59:01] like this amen it's the same sign the
[59:04] only difference brother Bob is the flesh
[59:07] that is being revealed in in the morning
[59:09] time it was revealed in the flesh of our
[59:12] Lord Jesus which is our bridegroom but
[59:14] in the evening time the prophet of God
[59:17] said amen I challenge you to believe
[59:20] amen that the son of man revealed again
[59:22] in human flesh amen through the brid's
[59:25] body
[59:26] listen I think it's time Amen to take
[59:29] all the
[59:30] emphasis come on church for years we've
[59:33] had guys that won't go no further amen
[59:35] than God sent a prophet and then we get
[59:37] some guys who will come a little bit
[59:39] further and say well God sent a prophet
[59:41] and he was Vindicated and they'll fight
[59:43] you amen like a junkyard dog over the
[59:45] Vindication of this Prophet amen but
[59:47] they'll never go in Amen to what he
[59:49] preach I say well the third pool was
[59:51] just for a prophet and the spoken word
[59:54] was just for a prophet and John 5 or
[59:56] John 15 uh John 5:24 amen he that
[59:59] believeth on me hath passed from Death
[1:00:01] un life they'll say well now listen
[1:00:02] that's for the bride amen but now but
[1:00:05] now John 14:12 that's just for brother
[1:00:07] brandom because in John 14:12 it just
[1:00:10] says he well let me ask you how far are
[1:00:12] you going to run that amen because if
[1:00:14] John 14:12 that he is only brother
[1:00:17] brandom amen you could very easily say
[1:00:20] the he of John 5:24 is only brother
[1:00:22] brandom as well so you've only got a
[1:00:24] prophet passing from death unto life but
[1:00:27] I propose to you tonight upon the
[1:00:30] authority of the written guarantee of
[1:00:32] the message of Malachi for that there is
[1:00:35] a bride in the last days that has been
[1:00:37] redeemed from the hand of the enemy
[1:00:39] she's been Sanctified she's been
[1:00:42] Justified she's been filled with the
[1:00:44] Holy Ghost and the Greater Works are
[1:00:46] being done through her flesh as a
[1:00:48] prophet said they would be
[1:00:51] done and then you say well you're
[1:00:52] getting out there I'm only going where a
[1:00:54] prophet went and he said the word of God
[1:00:57] the works of God will be revealed Again
[1:00:59] In the Flesh of the Bride what light are
[1:01:02] you talking about preacher I'm talking
[1:01:04] about the evening light amen or the
[1:01:06] Revealing Light or can I say the
[1:01:08] prophetic light in in Isaiah 60 y'all
[1:01:12] like your Bibles and then let's turn to
[1:01:14] Isaiah 60 in Isaiah 60 chapter 60 and
[1:01:17] verse one I love what the Bible says
[1:01:19] here Isaiah being a prophet he begins to
[1:01:22] prophesy and he says now arise and shine
[1:01:25] amen for thy light is come and the glory
[1:01:28] of the Lord is risen upon thee for
[1:01:31] Behold The Darkness shall cover the
[1:01:34] Earth and gross Darkness to people but
[1:01:37] the Lord shall arise upon thee and His
[1:01:40] glory shall be seen upon me so there's
[1:01:43] going to be a Darkness upon the Earth
[1:01:46] amen but listen there's going to be a
[1:01:47] worse Darkness upon the people that's
[1:01:50] upon on the face of the Earth in Shalom
[1:01:52] 1964 hold your place there he says now
[1:01:55] good morning which means peace he says
[1:01:58] the darkness is gathering amen what's it
[1:02:00] gathering for to show the light amen
[1:02:03] Isaiah 16 verse1 Rise and Shine for the
[1:02:06] light has come that's the reason I can
[1:02:08] say shalom the light has come to you see
[1:02:12] God's peace to the elected woman to the
[1:02:14] elected lady those who God before the
[1:02:17] foundation of the world Amen they called
[1:02:19] out and ordained to that look at verse
[1:02:23] three and the Gentiles amen shall come
[1:02:27] to thy light and the Kings to the
[1:02:30] brightness of thy Rising now amen I know
[1:02:33] amen it's a it's a Tuesday night so we
[1:02:34] might as well just preach for a second
[1:02:36] amen cuz it's an age Amen brother W
[1:02:38] where people go and they do their DNA
[1:02:40] you know they go on ancestry.com or
[1:02:42] they'll do some type of DNA and they'll
[1:02:45] get their results back and then all of a
[1:02:47] sudden they got 2% of 2% of 2% of Jewish
[1:02:52] or Israelite blood and all of a sudden
[1:02:54] they're Moses and Elijah they're one of
[1:02:56] the prophets to take the gospel back to
[1:02:57] the Jews amen they're they're come on
[1:03:00] they quit acting like a come on well I'm
[1:03:03] I'm might well just preach amen they
[1:03:05] quit they go back to feast and and and
[1:03:07] traditions and and washing pots and not
[1:03:10] eating pork and am and and just because
[1:03:12] they found a little inkland amen of some
[1:03:14] Jewish blood somewhere but according to
[1:03:16] my Bible amen this light was to come to
[1:03:19] the Gentiles listen I don't I hate to
[1:03:22] bust your bubble amen but when it's all
[1:03:24] said and done yeah I felt that Spirit a
[1:03:27] prophet was standing there on the border
[1:03:29] fishing to fly over to Israel and preach
[1:03:31] this gospel to them and the angel of God
[1:03:34] come down and said don't go it's not
[1:03:37] time for them to receive it you know why
[1:03:39] because there was the 11th Hour people
[1:03:41] which was Gentiles who would receive the
[1:03:44] cross of Calvary when the Jews rejected
[1:03:47] the Messiah there would be a bride on
[1:03:49] the earth who would have eyes to see and
[1:03:52] ears to hear and a heart to receive what
[1:03:54] the Jews had
[1:03:56] rejected now listen I'm not one that
[1:03:59] don't believe it's not going to go back
[1:04:00] it is going to go back and when it goes
[1:04:02] back the door will be closed amen but
[1:04:04] let's just let the rubber hit the road
[1:04:06] we're
[1:04:07] Gentiles and the Bible said the Gentiles
[1:04:10] shall come to thy lightam comes along in
[1:04:13] Shalom and he says here it is the light
[1:04:16] Vindicated again amen it's God's word so
[1:04:19] that you can see God manifested in his
[1:04:21] promise of the light of the day or the
[1:04:24] word given to this age see these
[1:04:26] promises that's been made for this day
[1:04:29] these promises that was said by the
[1:04:31] prophets and by Jesus himself y now when
[1:04:34] were they spoken in this
[1:04:37] day now you can take that to Hebrews 1
[1:04:40] God and sundri times and diverse manners
[1:04:43] amen they spake to their fathers amen
[1:04:45] through the prophets look but in this
[1:04:47] last day amen through his son Jesus
[1:04:51] Christ now let me just say this Jesus
[1:04:53] Christ testified that he was the True
[1:04:56] Light in St John 8:12 he said I am the
[1:05:00] light of the world see he that followeth
[1:05:02] me shall not walk in darkness but shall
[1:05:05] have the light of Life said like this
[1:05:09] without light amen nothing can live so
[1:05:12] the reason they're living under
[1:05:14] traditions and under Feast is because
[1:05:16] they don't have no light amen but the
[1:05:19] reason you're not living underneath
[1:05:21] those traditional Feast is because the
[1:05:23] Gentiles amen shall come to the evening
[1:05:26] life that was promised to return and to
[1:05:29] bring a resurrection in the church age
[1:05:31] book hope it's okay to preach from it he
[1:05:33] said no one could deny that Israel had
[1:05:35] light amen they were the only people who
[1:05:38] had light as a nation it was as when
[1:05:40] Egypt was so dark that one could feel it
[1:05:43] amen but in the homes of the Israelites
[1:05:45] there was light amen here it is church
[1:05:48] amen Darkness shall be upon the Earth
[1:05:50] and a gross Darkness upon the people but
[1:05:53] in the homes of those Israel lights
[1:05:56] there was light he said but now True
[1:05:58] light has come for the light of the
[1:06:01] world is Jesus Moses and the prophets
[1:06:04] amen they brought the light by the means
[1:06:05] of the scripture which was relevant to
[1:06:07] the Messiah thus Israel had light amen
[1:06:11] but now the Fulfillment of the light has
[1:06:13] come so when Egypt was in darkness there
[1:06:16] was light in the home of the Gentiles
[1:06:18] you know how there was light because
[1:06:20] there was somebody reading the Scrolls
[1:06:23] that was speaking of the prophecy of the
[1:06:25] coming of the Messiah but Jesus came
[1:06:28] upon the Earth and he said well you had
[1:06:30] light in your tents and you believe me
[1:06:32] back then amen but why can't you believe
[1:06:34] that what you was reading amen is
[1:06:37] standing in front of you oh church of
[1:06:39] living God we've read these books for 40
[1:06:41] and 50 and 30 years but can we come to a
[1:06:44] place that we can realize the things
[1:06:47] that we've been reading about we've been
[1:06:49] preaching about we've been studying
[1:06:51] about has come into the Flesh of the
[1:06:53] bride and is in fulfillment
[1:06:56] today listen somebody say well there's a
[1:06:58] bride coming I say there's a bride here
[1:07:01] somebody say well there's an invincible
[1:07:03] Army I say there's one here somebody
[1:07:05] said well there's an overcomer coming I
[1:07:07] say there's Overcomers here tonight hey
[1:07:10] because the word has been revealed
[1:07:13] according to the spirit and what was but
[1:07:15] the glowing word has now broken forth

[1:07:21] among his people I love this the
[1:07:24] sunshines amen for a seed that is gered
[1:07:27] to life and this Bible and his word in

[1:07:37] Amen to catch the eternal life amen
[1:07:40] those who are predestinated to see it
[1:07:43] can I say this Isaiah prophesied in
[1:07:46] chapter 42 but the prophecy was
[1:07:49] fulfilled in Matthew chapter 4 the Bible
[1:07:52] says in Matthew 4:16 that the people
[1:07:55] amen which sat in the darkness amen they
[1:07:58] saw great light and to them which sat in
[1:08:01] the region and the shadow of death amen
[1:08:04] Li is sprung up now look here they sat
[1:08:08] in the shadow of death Isaiah 9 and2 the
[1:08:12] people that walked in darkness have seen
[1:08:14] a great light listen and they that dwell
[1:08:17] in the land they that dwell in the land
[1:08:21] of the shadow of death upon them hath
[1:08:24] the life
[1:08:26] shined oh think about it church amen
[1:08:29] notice what he says here they are
[1:08:31] dwelling in the land of the shadow of
[1:08:34] death so in this land everything is
[1:08:37] affected by the shadow of
[1:08:40] death now come on church amen our

[1:10:26] and went to church amen see what it was
[1:10:28] he was underneath a controlling spirit
[1:10:30] and we laugh at something like that amen
[1:10:32] but what about today church amen what
[1:10:35] about around the ranks of our message
[1:10:36] when we got teenagers that don't even
[1:10:38] know what a prophet said what about

[1:10:42] kids in sports and missing the house of
[1:10:46] God come on church amen you know it's
[1:10:48] the truth amen all year long to go on

[1:10:53] meeting and it's time to go to the beach
[1:10:57] can I preach a minute are you hearing me
[1:10:59] and and it's it's the age we're living
[1:11:01] in the shadow of death has covered
[1:11:03] everything but thanks be to God he
[1:11:06] prophesied that he would come as a light
[1:11:09] and the light would bring light to the
[1:11:10] darkness and the Darkness being exposed
[1:11:13] would bring a condemnation upon your
[1:11:15] heart and you would fold the thing down
[1:11:18] and say I'll follow God and the freedom
[1:11:20] that the light has brought me I know
[1:11:22] that ain't I know that ain't popular
[1:11:24] preacher but it's still the
[1:11:25] truth somebody say well I don't know
[1:11:28] well I do I know today we got kids
[1:11:30] around this message that don't even know
[1:11:31] the sound of a prophet's
[1:11:33] Voice come on
[1:11:35] brother well we don't want to force them
[1:11:38] well you ain't you you oh god well we
[1:11:41] don't want to put too much pressure on
[1:11:42] them you know we don't want to no amen
[1:11:44] but you don't mind putting pressure on
[1:11:45] them with the world and you don't mind
[1:11:47] them knowing the the the latest sports
[1:11:49] star and you don't mind them knowing the
[1:11:51] latest education amen I say this amen I
[1:11:54] guess I may be 28 years old but I guess
[1:11:56] I'm just old school I Still Believe We
[1:11:59] ought to stand by what a prophet said I
[1:12:01] still remember when we preached Holiness
[1:12:03] and people shouted instead of pouted
[1:12:05] right I still remember the days when a
[1:12:08] man could come to a pull pit and just
[1:12:10] read a scripture and read a quote and
[1:12:12] stand there and just preach what a
[1:12:14] prophet said amen but now we got to
[1:12:16] sophisticated we got to have some
[1:12:18] intellectual come along and tell us why
[1:12:20] brother said it and how he meant it and
[1:12:22] the way he should have said it and why
[1:12:23] we can't and can't preach it well listen
[1:12:25] listen I have not forgot what the
[1:12:27] prophet said I know I'm Just a Nobody
[1:12:30] but this nobody knows what the prophet
[1:12:32] said he said there would be a bride and
[1:12:35] she would be so on fire with God until
[1:12:37] the devil don't know what to do with
[1:12:40] her she ain't going to be lukewarm and
[1:12:43] she ain't going to be formal and she
[1:12:44] ain't going to be questioning everything
[1:12:46] a prophet said she's going to be walking
[1:12:48] in the light that has condemned the
[1:12:51] idols of her life and brought her a
[1:12:54] Deliverance today the light of God is
[1:12:57] the word made
[1:12:59] manifest now I'll just say this I love
[1:13:02] what the Propet God said he said they
[1:13:03] say now look when you say in the dark
[1:13:05] shadow or the dark Valley of the Dark
[1:13:07] Shadow he said no it's the Valley of the
[1:13:10] shadow of death he said in other words
[1:13:12] it's a scarecrow to the believer listen
[1:13:15] just to scare them enough there's enough
[1:13:17] light mixed in it to show that there's
[1:13:19] light somewhere another place he said
[1:13:21] let me say one more thing there is a man
[1:13:24] here that can turn on the lights those
[1:13:27] who sat in the regions of the shadow of
[1:13:30] death some of them under cancer some of
[1:13:32] them under death of denomination some of
[1:13:34] them under Creed death some of them
[1:13:36] under traditional death and them all
[1:13:38] kinds of death but they have seen a
[1:13:40] great light the man that flashed the
[1:13:43] light then is the same one who said in
[1:13:45] the beginning let there be light and
[1:13:47] that same God yesterday today and
[1:13:48] forever he is present today right here
[1:13:51] now amen don't you get scared he can
[1:13:54] turn turn on the light he said there's
[1:13:57] one here today he's the only one he's
[1:13:59] got the light switch in his hand amen
[1:14:01] don't reject it receive it in the name
[1:14:05] of the Lord what is this light doing
[1:14:07] brother way this light has brought a
[1:14:10] resurrection into the church in other
[1:14:12] words the evening lights he said was the
[1:14:15] manifestation of the Resurrection when
[1:14:18] they didn't know he had raised from the
[1:14:20] dead although they loved him they
[1:14:21] believed him but they didn't know he had
[1:14:23] raised from the dead they argued against
[1:14:25] it amen but now here it is in the
[1:14:28] evening time and he's going to reveal
[1:14:31] himself that he is raised from the dead
[1:14:35] and how did he reveal himself by opening
[1:14:38] the scriptures to them in the prophet's
[1:14:40] message Ephesian Church AG Church age
[1:14:42] book he says he that ha an ear let him
[1:14:45] hear what the spirit sath in the church
[1:14:48] how tragic it is that the first age did
[1:14:50] not listen to Spirit instead it listened
[1:14:54] to man
[1:14:55] amen but remember there was a
[1:14:56] resurrection in the morning time and
[1:14:59] there'll be a resurrection in the
[1:15:00] evening time he said but thank God in
[1:15:03] the last age there will be a group rise

[1:15:19] last day and she will listen to the
[1:15:22] spirit and in that day of grow Darkness
[1:15:26] the light will return by the pure word
[1:15:29] and we will return to the power of
[1:15:31] Pentecost to welcome back the Lord Jesus
[1:15:34] Christ my so he rose she's going to rise

[1:17:26] to me listen because light comes but as
[1:17:28] always though people love Darkness more
[1:17:31] than they love light the Bible said this
[1:17:33] is the condemnation that light has come
[1:17:36] into the world and Men love Darkness
[1:17:38] rather than light because their deeds
[1:17:40] were evil look here but he that doeth
[1:17:44] truth cometh to the light that his deeds
[1:17:46] may be manifested that they are roed in
[1:17:49] God so the prophet of God said see he
[1:17:51] said the son is the king of all livs on
[1:17:54] this Earth in the naturalites he said
[1:17:57] then when the word of God Rises all
[1:17:59] superstitions let me back up here for a
[1:18:01] second he said when the he said the P Su
[1:18:04] n naturalite King he said now listen no
[1:18:06] matter how much artificial light we have
[1:18:09] how many electric ray we can produce
[1:18:11] when that sun rises all the rest of them
[1:18:14] dim out when the Su in Rises come on
[1:18:17] Church what's more powerful amen the
[1:18:20] lamp by your bed or the Su in in the
[1:18:23] sky come on what's more powerful your
[1:18:26] little flashlight or the Su in listen
[1:18:29] because a flashlight only has the
[1:18:31] ability to reveal so much I remember one
[1:18:34] time I I I think of this often when I
[1:18:36] get to reading these quotes I remember
[1:18:37] one time we were hunting one time in and
[1:18:39] my uncles and we went out real early you
[1:18:41] know how you go out there before the
[1:18:42] daylight comes and you got your
[1:18:43] flashlight you know and you only use it
[1:18:45] as much as you need it cuz you don't
[1:18:47] want to Spook anything off so we get
[1:18:49] over there to our to where we're hunting
[1:18:50] we get set up and while we're standing
[1:18:52] there brother way I'm looking out across
[1:18:54] the across the ridge there and I see
[1:18:56] this big you know this big lump or
[1:18:58] something there on top of the Ridge and
[1:18:59] I leaned over to my uncles and I said
[1:19:01] that's a deer well they thought it was
[1:19:03] kind of funny because here it is pitch
[1:19:05] black dark I mean well it's starting to
[1:19:06] break light but it's still not shooting
[1:19:08] light still dark and I look over and I
[1:19:10] said there's a deer and I never forget
[1:19:12] it they said oh that ain't a deer and I
[1:19:13] said that's a deer guys that's a deer up
[1:19:15] there so about about 30 40 minutes later
[1:19:17] the sun come up and all of a sudden
[1:19:19] we're standing there and what was laying
[1:19:21] up on top of the hill stands up and it's
[1:19:23] a little deer or not a little deer it
[1:19:25] was a nice it was a good siiz deer and
[1:19:27] it turns and my Uncle Andy already had
[1:19:29] his gun up to shoot it and when he saw
[1:19:31] it I looked over him I said it was a
[1:19:32] deer wasn't
[1:19:34] it now see I could only tell them that
[1:19:38] come on now because I somehow had the
[1:19:41] ability to see it but they could not see
[1:19:43] it until the light shined upon are y'all
[1:19:46] hearing me and church Living God a
[1:19:49] Prophet come among the church and he had
[1:19:51] the ability to see some things but
[1:19:53] people wouldn't believe it but when the
[1:19:55] S so n Rose they could see for
[1:19:57] themselves he said see when the word of
[1:20:00] God Rises superstitions and
[1:20:02] denominational fanaticisms and those
[1:20:04] things spread away and it shows exactly
[1:20:07] what it is and the word of God made
[1:20:09] manifest always separates the light from
[1:20:13] the darkness he said his word is
[1:20:16] superior over all men's words over all
[1:20:20] anything his word is light now let me
[1:20:23] just say it to you very plainly
[1:20:24] therefore Darkness and Light will not
[1:20:27] mix he said because light is so much
[1:20:30] more powerful it just puts the darkness
[1:20:32] out amen can I say this to you if you're
[1:20:36] living in
[1:20:37] darkness if you're going to church under
[1:20:40] Darkness if you're listening to tapes

[1:20:53] darkness no more the light has come and
[1:20:56] the great conqueror is here B said what
[1:21:00] does the light come to do he said the
[1:21:02] light comes on to reveal something is
[1:21:03] that right amen what good does you do to
[1:21:06] reveal if you haven't got asked to see
[1:21:08] what's been revealed he said what you

[1:41:09] Church God's Church moves onward mes
[1:41:12] onward and
[1:41:14] upward said Mama walked in one light
[1:41:16] you're walking in another Luther walked
[1:41:18] in one light Wesley walked in another
[1:41:20] Wesley walked in one L Pentecost walked
[1:41:22] in another but we're walking on higher
[1:41:24] than that today and if there's another
[1:41:27] generation it'll go beyond us what are
[1:41:31] you saying preacher I'm saying this is
[1:41:33] the hour this is the advancement of the
[1:41:37] Gospel come on Church it is Advanced
[1:41:40] amen from the birth to the death amen
[1:41:43] come on it is Advanced from the birth to
[1:41:45] the life from the life to the death from
[1:41:47] the death to the burial from the burial
[1:41:49] to the resurrection but Church of the
[1:41:51] Living God it is gone just beyond the
[1:41:53] first resurrection it has advanced until
[1:41:56] there is another spoken word seed rde
[1:41:59] upon on the earth who is in position to
[1:42:02] resurrect and
[1:42:04] change but this is the thing today he
[1:42:07] said the church grain don't want to
[1:42:08] mature it wants to stay back in Moody's
[1:42:10] time or sanki or fny or Knox or Calvin
[1:42:12] they were all right that was light of
[1:42:14] their hour but this is another hour this
[1:42:18] is another day this is another hour this
[1:42:22] is another day
[1:42:23] this is the advancement of the Gospel
[1:42:25] it's coming to its maturity so we cannot
[1:42:29] live in what Luther said or Wesley said
[1:42:31] or the rest of them said we're living in
[1:42:34] the light that's predicted for this day
[1:42:36] we're in the seven Church age not the
[1:42:39] third or the fourth the grain should be
[1:42:42] able to receive
[1:42:44] it come on church if it doesn't it falls

[1:43:17] brother Ram said and judge the situation
[1:43:18] by what Luther said yeah come on or they
[1:43:22] and I'm not trying I'm noty trying to
[1:43:23] meddle but I'm just preaching a second
[1:43:24] here amen that's that's like a brother

[1:45:25] knowing the time that now it is high
[1:45:27] time to awaken out of sleep for now is
[1:45:29] our Salvation nearer than when we
[1:45:32] believed the light is far spent the day
[1:45:34] is at hand let us therefore cast off the
[1:45:37] works of darkness and let us put on the
[1:45:40] armor of light Redeeming the time

[1:45:46] time look at this Redeeming the time buy
[1:45:48] up every and each opportunity look at
[1:45:52] this word time it means the Supreme
[1:45:54] moment brother Aaron it's the golden
[1:45:56] opportunity in other words Paul is
[1:45:59] saying little bride Church redeem our
[1:46:03] golden opportunity in the presence of
[1:46:06] God himself Church you are the first
[1:46:10] ones that is not in the stalk you're not
[1:46:13] in the tassel you're not in the shuck
[1:46:15] the shuck has give forth to the seed and
[1:46:18] the seed is in the presence of the Son
[1:46:21] and the son is none other than God
[1:46:25] himself oh amen can I can I can I unload
[1:46:28] my heart on you right now why are we
[1:46:31] wasting time in the presence of the
[1:46:36] son you say preacher you're bringing it
[1:46:38] down serious I am because the prophet
[1:46:41] did he said don't you never fail your
[1:46:43] opportunity you know what he said in the
[1:46:45] Easter seal right before he goes off the
[1:46:47] scene he said oh Christian what an
[1:46:49] opportunity we have we have opportunity
[1:46:51] St Paul never dreamed of having we have
[1:46:54] opportunities Enoch and Elijah and all
[1:46:56] them never had the opportunities we have
[1:47:01] now
[1:47:04] now you say preacher you're getting
[1:47:06] pretty bold I am getting bold because
[1:47:08] you're the first generation that's
[1:47:10] laying in the presence of the son that's
[1:47:15] right now I'm going to close on this
[1:47:18] right
[1:47:19] here we have opportunities that Enoch
[1:47:24] and
[1:47:24] Elijah never had the opportunities we
[1:47:28] have now you know I think this is very
[1:47:30] powerful that Enoch a type of the Bride
[1:47:33] type of the believer do you all know in
[1:47:35] the Book of Genesis 5:21 I'm going is it
[1:47:38] can I have a few more
[1:47:39] minutes Enoch lived 6 and5 years and
[1:47:42] begat methusa and begat and now watch
[1:47:44] here and Enoch walked with God after he
[1:47:47] begat Methuselah 300 years and begat
[1:47:50] Sons and Daughters let me reread that
[1:47:52] and Enoch built a pyramid after he begat
[1:47:55] methusa 300 years and begat sons and
[1:47:57] daughters and I'm I'm doing this on
[1:47:59] purpose so just stay with me and all the
[1:48:01] days of Enoch were 365 years and Enoch
[1:48:04] built a pyramid and he was not for God
[1:48:06] took him let me read Hebrews 11:5 and
[1:48:09] just see if this reads right by faith
[1:48:11] Enoch was translated he should not see
[1:48:12] death and was not found because God had
[1:48:14] translated him before his translation he
[1:48:17] had this
[1:48:18] testimony that he pleased God Amen okay
[1:48:22] now I just read to you Genesis
[1:48:24] 5:21 and most people don't even realize
[1:48:28] that Enoch built a
[1:48:31] pyramid but brother Bob you know what's
[1:48:33] astounding to me is anytime Enoch is
[1:48:36] mentioned you know what the first thing
[1:48:38] people think about they don't think
[1:48:40] about the pyramid he
[1:48:43] built on hello they don't think about
[1:48:46] the pyramid you know what they think
[1:48:48] about they think about his
[1:48:51] walk nobody gets up and says glory to
[1:48:54] God Enoch built a
[1:48:56] pyramid do they they get up and say
[1:48:59] glory to God Enoch walked with God yeah
[1:49:02] you know why because the outstanding
[1:49:05] thing about Enoch was not what he
[1:49:07] built
[1:49:10] right I got here too late but let me
[1:49:12] just preach it to you come on but it was
[1:49:15] how he
[1:49:16] walked have you ever sat down and looked
[1:49:18] at Enoch's pyramid just sit down and
[1:49:20] look at it there is so much revelation
[1:49:23] that Enoch built in that pyramid that
[1:49:25] brother it almost blow your mind if you
[1:49:27] start looking at how Enoch built a
[1:49:29] king's chamber and he had they they had
[1:49:31] a downward path and an upward path all
[1:49:33] these things if you break open the
[1:49:35] pyramid you see what Enoch put in there
[1:49:37] and all of that was by Revelation come
[1:49:40] on church all of that was Revelation but
[1:49:43] nowhere does the bible say that go ahead
[1:49:47] that Enoch built a pyramid and it
[1:49:49] pleased God it said he walked with God
[1:49:53] some I know where guys go I know where
[1:49:55] people go with that they say there you
[1:49:56] go bless God we don't need none of this
[1:49:58] Revelation glory to God hallelujah we
[1:50:00] just need a simple gospel no because let
[1:50:02] me show you something Enoch's Revelation
[1:50:04] that was in that pyramid brother Aaron
[1:50:06] it got into his
[1:50:08] walk Come On Church you don't have to go
[1:50:11] look at the pyramid to see what was in
[1:50:13] it you could see what was in it in
[1:50:15] Enoch's walk because he was a direct
[1:50:18] reflection of the Revelation that was in
[1:50:20] the pyramid what are you saying preacher
[1:50:23] I'm saying what the prophet said he said
[1:50:24] Enoch just kept walking in the light and
[1:50:27] one day he felt his feet getting light
[1:50:29] he said so you know what he did he just
[1:50:31] kept on walking and he walked on into
[1:50:34] Glory without even Dying God took him
[1:50:36] away because he was walking in the light
[1:50:40] with the testimony that he walked in the
[1:50:42] light of God he just kept on walking can

[2:02:52] to you and and it was burning on my
[2:02:54] heart today as I was thinking of these
[2:02:55] things several years ago we were there
[2:02:57] and was preaching for brother Roy we
[2:02:59] were there and helped helped him there
[2:03:00] in the church for several years and was
[2:03:02] associate our brother Ro away in the
[2:03:04] church there and had a had a major
[2:03:06] decision and thing in my life I come to
[2:03:08] a time of transition and I went down to
[2:03:11] the church one day and I met brother Roy
[2:03:12] if any of y'all knew brother Shrewsberry
[2:03:14] he was a praying man man I mean that man
[2:03:16] that man lived to pray I mean 9 three 9
[2:03:20] 12 and three every day praying I went
[2:03:22] down there and I met him I said brother
[2:03:23] Roy I said I'm dealing with something a
[2:03:24] transition from the Lord and I said to
[2:03:26] be honest with you I said I really don't
[2:03:28] understand it I said but all I know is
[2:03:31] there's something in my heart and it's
[2:03:33] leading
[2:03:34] me and I said I just I just got to
[2:03:37] follow it and he said brother Andrew he
[2:03:39] said as long as I know you he said ever
[2:03:43] since you first come here he said I just
[2:03:44] 17 18 years old he said ever since you
[2:03:46] come here he said I've always known you
[2:03:49] to preach what a prophet said in the of
[2:03:52] other people telling you not to and he
[2:03:54] said I know it's cost you a lot and he
[2:03:56] said I know you followed God when it was
[2:03:58] difficult and he said I have a he says I
[2:04:00] have 100% confidence that you're
[2:04:02] following him right now I said but
[2:04:04] brother Roy I said it don't make sense
[2:04:07] when I don't understand why to just go
[2:04:10] just follow the leading he said let me
[2:04:12] tell you this brother Andrew and I hope
[2:04:14] pray it's okay to share he said years
[2:04:16] ago you all know brother Roy was
[2:04:17] actually in World War II he's a World
[2:04:19] War II vet Purple Heart veteran brother
[2:04:21] Roy told me he said when I was in the
[2:04:23] war he said I was on the battlefield and
[2:04:25] he said I got injured and he said when I
[2:04:28] got injured he said I got shot or
[2:04:30] something something hit him he was
[2:04:31] injured in his arm and he said it was
[2:04:33] cold it was rainy he said and there was
[2:04:35] no Aid stations around there he said
[2:04:38] nowhere no aid station nothing he said I
[2:04:40] was bleeding and he said I just wanted
[2:04:42] to cover up my arm and he said I wanted
[2:04:44] to find a tree and I just wanted to lay
[2:04:47] down there next to that tree and he said
[2:04:49] I went over there and I laid down next
[2:04:50] to that tree and he said a voice spoke
[2:04:53] to me and he said you know what that
[2:04:54] voice said it said if you lay here
[2:04:56] you'll die get up and start walking he
[2:04:59] said I didn't hardly have strength but I
[2:05:01] pushed myself up off the tree and he
[2:05:03] said I started walking he said my head
[2:05:05] was down I was hurting he said and I
[2:05:07] would he said I'd make some fast steps
[2:05:09] he said then all of a sudden I couldn't
[2:05:10] hardly make another step but he said
[2:05:12] that voice said just keep walking just
[2:05:14] keep walking he said finally I stopped
[2:05:17] and I said to myself I said this makes
[2:05:19] no sense to keep walking when I'm dying
[2:05:22] and there's no aid station around here
[2:05:24] he said this is ridiculous he said
[2:05:26] common sense is telling me to sit down
[2:05:28] here and get this and he said all of a
[2:05:30] sudden that voice said just keep walking
[2:05:33] and he said I said you know what I'm
[2:05:34] just going to keep on walking he said
[2:05:36] and about that time I lifted up my head
[2:05:38] and he said I saw an aid station and I
[2:05:40] was standing right in the middle of
[2:05:43] it he said if I laid down I died he said
[2:05:48] if I would have followed common sense I
[2:05:49] would have died he said but I just kept
[2:05:51] walking and I walked right into what I
[2:05:56] needed Church don't get mad at me but
[2:05:58] you don't need a
[2:05:59] raise you don't need a bigger

[2:16:46] right brother Brown en built the Pyramid
[2:16:49] you know that thing he built them so
[2:16:52] well it was one of the only things that
[2:16:54] survived the
[2:16:55] flood it stayed right where it was at it
[2:16:58] didn't move it wasn't covered up right
[2:17:01] Enoch built those pyramids to
[2:17:05] last right God built us to last through
[2:17:09] the greatest flood that ever was on the
[2:17:11] face of the Earth that changed a whole
[2:17:13] course of of rivers and continents and
[2:17:16] actually tilted the Earth
[2:17:19] 12° pyramids still
[2:17:21] stood Enoch built it and then he walked
[2:17:24] off the Earth brother bam said he looked
[2:17:26] and said when Enoch took a Rapture he
[2:17:28] knew that judgment was coming amen when
[2:17:32] this bride leaves this world I'll
[2:17:33] promise you judgment will strike this
[2:17:36] place amen we're the only people that
[2:17:38] are
[2:17:39] left that's holding it together nobody
[2:17:42] else is the word of God in a group of
[2:17:46] people is holding this whole thing
[2:17:48] together and I believe that I believe
[2:17:50] our our brother believed that and and
[2:17:52] you're right when I met him he was a he
[2:17:54] looked like a teddy bear he's about 13
[2:17:57] years old he's about as tall as is now
[2:17:59] but he he's lost an extra person since
[2:18:02] I've met him first time and he's he's
[2:18:06] grown in God he I remember when we used
[2:18:08] to go to brother Bill y's and there he'd
[2:18:11] be he'd be in a ministers meeting but
[2:18:13] Bill would have to leave and take him
[2:18:15] somewhere to preach cuz he didn't have
[2:18:16] driver's license yet he was 14 years old
[2:18:19] 14 13 14 years old brother Bill took him
[2:18:22] around to places to preach well I'm glad
[2:18:24] brother Bill did that amen because it
[2:18:27] sure built a a young man that knows what
[2:18:31] he's talking about it's like Dad always
[2:18:34] says I believe he believes what he
[2:18:36] preached right now we need to believe
