[27:27] lord we just look to you because we know
[27:29] that you are the one
[27:31] that can answer all our questions lord
[27:33] take care of all of our problems and all
[27:34] of our needs
[27:36] lord we commit it to you in the name of
[27:37] jesus christ we pray amen
[27:40] amen john chapter 3
[27:44] and it says he that cometh from above is
[27:46] above all
[27:47] he that is of the earth is earthly and
[27:50] speaketh of the earth he that cometh
[27:52] from heaven is above all
[27:54] and what he has seen and heard
[27:56] he that testified and no man receiveth
[28:00] his testimony
[28:01] he that hath received his to his
[28:03] testimony has set to his seal
[28:07] that god is true for whom god hath sent
[28:11] speaketh the words of god for god giveth
[28:13] not the spirit by measure unto him
[28:16] the father loveth the son and have given
[28:19] all things into his hand he that
[28:21] believeth on the son hath everlasting
[28:23] life he that believeth not on the son
[28:25] shall not see life but the wrath of god
[28:28] abideth on him
[28:31] and then we're going to go to acts
[28:32] chapter one
[28:34] very familiar scriptures here
[28:37] and it says the former treatise
[28:40] have i made oath theopolis
[28:42] of all that jesus began to
[28:44] to do and teach
[28:46] until the day in which he was taken up
[28:49] after
[28:50] that he
[28:51] through the holy spirit had given
[28:52] commandments unto the disciples whom he
[28:55] had chosen to whom he also showed
[28:57] himself alive after his passion by many
[29:01] infallible proofs
[29:02] being seen of him forty days and
[29:04] speaking of the things pertaining to the
[29:06] kingdom of god
[29:07] and being assembled together with them
[29:10] commanded them that they should not
[29:11] depart from jerusalem but wait for the
[29:14] promise of the father which
[29:16] saith he
[29:18] ye have heard of me for john truly
[29:21] baptized with water but ye shall be
[29:23] baptized with the holy ghost not many
[29:25] days hence
[29:27] when they therefore were come together
[29:29] they asked him saying lord will thou
[29:32] at this time restore again the kingdom
[29:34] to israel and he said unto them it is
[29:36] not for you to know the times or the
[29:39] seasons which the father hath put in his
[29:42] power
[29:43] but ye shall receive power
[29:45] after that the holy ghost has come upon
[29:47] you and you shall be witnesses unto me
[29:50] both in jerusalem and all judea and in
[29:53] samaria
[29:54] and unto the uttermost parts of the
[29:58] earth god bless you this morning baby
[30:00] seated
[30:02] [Music]
[30:06] it's getting warm up here
[30:10] i don't know if y'all if y'all know we
[30:13] had a little issue with the air
[30:14] conditioner we got heat we got no air
[30:16] conditioning so
[30:18] we we can get all if you're cold you can
[30:20] get hot all you want
[30:24] but
[30:27] we'll have to
[30:29] work on that in
[30:31] in in the future
[30:34] but this morning i want to speak on
[30:35] impeaching of a witness
[30:38] and
[30:39] uh the i want to read the quote from the
[30:42] message the testimony of a true witness
[30:44] and brother branham says
[30:46] he says now a testimony he said before a
[30:49] person has
[30:50] has to have an experience before they
[30:52] can testify
[30:53] if you were called in court
[30:56] and you have to give a testimony you
[30:57] have to know something before you can
[30:59] testify and a witness is a person that
[31:01] has seen something that knows that it is
[31:03] the truth and they're called to give
[31:05] witness
[31:07] and then a witness must know what he's
[31:08] talking about
[31:10] he must not
[31:11] he must be not someone told me a certain
[31:14] certain thing he must be the witness
[31:16] himself if not he's speaking
[31:18] of someone else that could be a witness
[31:21] at the scene
[31:22] he said no i think that
[31:24] being that we
[31:26] see out from our congregation that life
[31:28] is so fragile
[31:29] then death that is so positive
[31:34] a positive not like death is
[31:37] a positive thing but it is something
[31:39] that carries you through so it's just an
[31:40] avenue to get into the presence of god
[31:44] but you know i mean it is something that
[31:45] we all have to face
[31:49] so
[31:50] one of the things we i will look at this
[31:52] morning is because if death is is
[31:54] something that's certain
[31:57] see it's when when brother talking about
[31:59] bypassing death he's not really talking
[32:01] about you're going to bypass death
[32:04] because the last enemy to be destroyed
[32:07] is death
[32:09] so it's not like we're going to go
[32:10] around it
[32:13] like we're going by but we're going to
[32:14] overcome it
[32:17] so it's not that it's not that we're
[32:19] going you know everybody's know you're
[32:21] going to face death
[32:23] as brother brown said you know you're
[32:24] just going to wipe it off
[32:26] but he's still going to come
[32:28] you're still fighting the effects of
[32:30] death every day
[32:31] you're still getting older
[32:34] we're all getting older we're all still
[32:36] having problems
[32:37] we're still faking that thing but you
[32:39] know what but we're going to overcome it
[32:42] because as the scripture said see he
[32:44] overcame
[32:47] and so then if we are a part of him
[32:50] then if he overcome that we overcome
[32:52] he's overcome these things
[32:55] he said we need to come to a place that
[32:57] we are positive sure that this that we
[33:00] speak of is right
[33:02] see it is not nothing that we can just
[33:05] haphazardly as we would would say accept
[33:08] it you've got to be positive sure that
[33:11] it's right because we do not know what
[33:13] kind of
[33:15] of an end that we will come to
[33:18] and he says that's the reason i'm that i
[33:20] am a calvinistic thinker a security
[33:22] of security of the believer is because
[33:24] that i believe that when a man or a
[33:26] woman is in their right mind that is in
[33:29] the time to that is is the time to
[33:32] accept the lord jesus and get it all
[33:34] settled in once forever because when we
[33:36] come to the end of the road we don't
[33:38] know just where how we're going to be
[33:41] sick we may be sick in our mind
[33:44] there there might be a fever that you
[33:47] know that would really cook our very
[33:49] brain and we might not might not say
[33:52] anything or do anything at the end of
[33:54] the road
[33:54] we don't know but you see
[33:56] if we have already anchored in christ no
[33:59] matter what sickness takes us or what
[34:01] condition we are
[34:04] what we are when we go it's already
[34:06] settled we are sealed unto the day of
[34:08] our redemption
[34:09] ephesians 4 30 says grieve not the holy
[34:12] spirit of god whereby ye are sealed
[34:14] until the day not of your death but of
[34:17] your redemption see after death's done
[34:20] over you're still sealed
[34:24] so this morning when we speak of
[34:28] being a part of god
[34:32] and being a witness
[34:37] and just reading the scriptures here
[34:39] brother brown
[34:40] said when he read john
[34:43] and one of them talks about a testimony
[34:45] and the other one he said talks about a
[34:47] witness
[34:49] and so this morning
[34:51] i want to
[34:53] speak on being
[34:54] a witness
[34:57] but impeaching of a witness
[35:00] and
[35:00] the um definition of impeach means
[35:05] to dispute
[35:07] to disparage deny or contradict
[35:10] he said to attempt to prove that a
[35:12] witness has not told the truth or has
[35:15] been inconsistent
[35:17] by introducing contrary evidence
[35:19] including statements made outside of the
[35:21] courtroom in dispositions or in
[35:23] statements of the witness heard by
[35:25] another
[35:28] so when we speak of having an
[35:31] impeaching of a witness
[35:34] then there's there's three
[35:36] witnesses
[35:38] that has to has to be uh looked at this
[35:41] morning that we won't look at and and
[35:43] the and the first one is
[35:46] god
[35:48] and when we look at god being a witness
[35:50] because god spoke
[35:52] yes
[35:53] and in the and
[35:55] we'll see here in a minute you know
[35:58] brother branham said i believe it was in
[36:00] the message at thy word brother branham
[36:02] says that god believed his own word
[36:05] and the things come into existence
[36:09] and then we we see that jesus was a
[36:11] witness
[36:12] jesus was a witness of the father
[36:15] he was a manifestation
[36:18] and so we said we see and then
[36:21] there is the witness
[36:23] of you and i
[36:24] we are we are a witness
[36:27] and so you know because brother branham
[36:30] said one time
[36:32] he was talking about political parties
[36:34] and
[36:35] you know when you when you start talking
[36:36] about political parties that's how you
[36:37] get into impeachment because you know
[36:39] that's the big thing now you know you
[36:41] don't like somebody going to get rid of
[36:42] them
[36:44] but you know when you when you begin to
[36:45] look at this and brother branham says
[36:47] you know he said
[36:49] god voted for me
[36:51] and he said the devil voted against me
[36:54] but he said i voted with god he said so
[36:56] i know my vote's right
[36:59] and he said he said because he said you
[37:01] know they were talking about political
[37:02] parties he said my party's in heaven
[37:06] so i know i know where i'm where i'm
[37:07] voting from
[37:09] but you have to make that decision
[37:11] but see if we're going to be if we're
[37:13] going to be a a witness to see the
[37:15] things of god then we have to believe
[37:17] what has been told
[37:19] and so as as brother m talked about in a
[37:22] court trial you know he began to put
[37:24] the the word of god and and the holy
[37:26] spirit on trial and and say you know is
[37:28] this really true and we're gonna we're
[37:30] gonna prove whether it's right or not
[37:33] and so you know you have to decide
[37:35] whether it's true or not
[37:37] but you know the scripture there where
[37:39] it talks about in acts
[37:41] acts 1 and 3 i thought was so good
[37:43] because and he says
[37:45] he said to whom also he showed himself
[37:48] alive after his passion by many many
[37:52] infallible proofs
[37:54] so he began to show to the disciples
[37:57] that he was alive and the things that he
[37:58] had done and you know as we've covered
[38:01] the last few uh sermons you know we've
[38:03] been talking on the on the life of
[38:05] christ and
[38:07] looking at it and and bringing the
[38:09] parallel
[38:10] a little bit between seeing this message
[38:13] and seeing that the life of jesus christ
[38:15] and this message is the same because
[38:17] it's one and the same and it's not
[38:19] anything different but it's the exact
[38:20] same thing it's the life of jesus it's
[38:23] the word of god because he was the word
[38:26] he is the word made flesh and that's
[38:27] what we've received in our day is the
[38:29] word made flesh again so there's no
[38:31] difference between what we've received
[38:34] and what was written in the old in the
[38:35] new testament
[38:38] and what we've seen because you know
[38:39] many people you know they they want to
[38:41] try to disparage or discourage and
[38:43] contradict this message but they can't
[38:46] the more that they've tried to tear it
[38:48] down the more they can't tear it down
[38:51] why because god never has been without a
[38:53] witness
[38:55] he's always had a witness and you know
[38:56] what when when everything comes when he
[38:58] said when when the enemy comes in like a
[39:00] flood he said he'd raise up a standard
[39:02] against it he'll always have an answer
[39:05] but you know the thing is you because
[39:07] those that are believers
[39:09] there's no power in hell there's nothing
[39:12] that's going to take them away from
[39:13] believing
[39:15] but those that are unbelievers it
[39:17] doesn't matter you're not ever going to
[39:18] get them to believe
[39:20] you know brother bran was talking about
[39:21] that man that didn't believe in divine
[39:23] healing and he stood there and he was
[39:24] like i don't care how many doctors you
[39:26] bring up here he said i don't believe in
[39:28] divine healing he said i don't care what
[39:30] evidence you bring and brother ram said
[39:32] well that's true he said because it
[39:33] wasn't for you he said but it was for
[39:36] them that would believe
[39:38] it's for those that will believe so when
[39:40] when he makes the divine promises of god
[39:43] or yea and amen but it's only to those
[39:46] that will believe what god said
[39:48] and it's not it's not for the world but
[39:50] you know you know you're not going to
[39:52] argue and you're not going to condem
[39:54] convince these people of what what the
[39:56] truth is but the only thing is is we're
[39:58] going to god's going to have a witness
[40:00] in this last day the bride of jesus
[40:02] christ is going to show to the world
[40:04] what is written in this book why because
[40:06] she's going to be the book made manifest
[40:13] you know you know we you're not going to
[40:15] argue and you're not going to turn
[40:16] people to the truth
[40:18] the only thing can do that is the holy
[40:20] ghost but you know what we're going to
[40:21] proclaim this word he pro jesus done his
[40:24] part he walked and he was the word made
[40:26] flesh and he began to speak to him and
[40:28] he and the scripture says you know he
[40:30] told himself who convinced me of sin
[40:34] who can who can show that that i have
[40:35] walked from contrary to the word
[40:41] and many times it's it's you and i
[40:47] we're going to get into this but you
[40:49] know if he said that you and i are born
[40:52] of his bone and flesh of his flesh
[40:55] and life of his life
[40:57] then we should be able to make that same
[40:59] claim
[41:08] but whose witness
[41:10] will we will we believe
[41:12] who hath believed our report
[41:15] and to whom is the arm of the lord
[41:16] revealed
[41:19] as isaiah said who who's going to
[41:21] believe what god has said
[41:25] this is from the message
[41:27] at thy word lord
[41:31] he says he said you don't know how
[41:34] you'll get up out of that chair get away
[41:36] from there tonight see you don't know
[41:39] how you're going to do this or how these
[41:41] other diseases are going to be healed he
[41:43] said but at the word lord i'm going to
[41:45] let down the net at thy word lord i'm
[41:47] going to raise up from here i don't know
[41:49] how i'm going to do it but at thy word
[41:52] lord that's it take god at his word and
[41:55] god's spoken word must will materialize
[41:58] and produce just exactly what it says it
[42:00] will listen
[42:02] the right mental attitude toward any
[42:05] divine promise of god will bring it to
[42:07] pass i don't care what it is he said if
[42:10] you plant it if you plant corn you plant
[42:12] corn water corn leave corn alone it'll
[42:14] produce corn is that right wheat will
[42:17] produce wheat he said the promise of
[42:19] salvation will produce a christian the
[42:22] promise of the holy ghost will bring it
[42:24] to you
[42:25] the promise of divine healing will make
[42:27] you well
[42:29] any divine promise of god and the bible
[42:31] said that the word of god is a seed is
[42:33] that right jesus said
[42:35] that a sower soaked
[42:37] he said if you'll just take it in your
[42:39] heart and don't dig it up every day to
[42:41] see how it's getting along just sink it
[42:44] in your heart and settle it that's all
[42:46] walk right on god will take care of the
[42:48] rest of it he's obligated to his word
[42:51] do you know that everything that you see
[42:54] tonight is god's word materialized
[42:57] said do you know your body is god's word
[42:59] materialized do you know them beings
[43:02] there is god's words materialized do you
[43:04] know that concrete is god's word
[43:06] materialized do you know this whole
[43:08] earth as god spoke and said let there be
[43:10] and he believed his own word and it come
[43:13] into existence
[43:14] if it didn't where did it come from
[43:17] well you say it'll come off the sun well
[43:20] he spoke
[43:22] the son into existence see everything is
[43:24] god's own word the worlds were framed by
[43:26] the word of god
[43:28] the bible said so god just spoke it and
[43:30] he believed his own word and that was
[43:32] that's what it was
[43:34] he said now god has spoken his word to
[43:36] us
[43:37] just believe him and watch what happens
[43:40] now when he speaks something this is his
[43:42] word initially first and any other word
[43:44] that's contrary to this is not god's
[43:47] word it has to come
[43:49] from the bible
[43:51] so this is what god has spoken and
[43:54] everything that we have and he believed
[43:55] his own word
[43:58] so he began to he saw what god what he
[44:00] believed what he said because he knew
[44:02] what was going to take place
[44:04] he had what he had in his mind his
[44:06] vision of what was going to take place
[44:09] and the great thing about god is god's
[44:11] never been
[44:12] shocked nobody's ever taken him by
[44:14] surprise
[44:16] he knew always what was going to take
[44:17] place he knew that you'd be here this
[44:19] morning no every problem that you ever
[44:21] faced but you know what when every
[44:23] problem came your way whatever this
[44:25] decision whatever it was that came your
[44:27] way you know what he's already made a
[44:29] way for you
[44:31] he said with every temptation he said
[44:33] there would be a way of escape mate so
[44:35] whatever the problem was that you came
[44:37] here this morning with whatever bondage
[44:39] or whatever problem it is you know what
[44:41] god has already got the answer for it
[44:43] you know there's never been a problem
[44:45] that's come that god doesn't already
[44:47] know what the answer is it has the
[44:49] answer already for you
[44:51] he said but he said before you call i
[44:53] will answer
[44:55] so then when the answer is already there
[44:57] then all we got to do is believe it
[45:00] that's right
[45:02] but the problem is is do we believe it
[45:07] because one of the one of the problems
[45:09] that we have that we'll see here is when
[45:12] when there's there's a witness that is
[45:13] coming and and the holy spirit has come
[45:16] to witness the word
[45:19] so when the holy spirit has come to
[45:21] witness the word then he speaks what the
[45:23] word is
[45:25] and he speaks it to you
[45:27] but then the other the other witness
[45:29] that we have is the devil
[45:32] and the devil is there and he's going to
[45:33] begin to speak to you
[45:36] and who are you going to listen to
[45:40] because when we when we get through some
[45:41] of the and later on in the scripture and
[45:44] here we're going to see that you know
[45:46] you've got to that's the reason i said
[45:47] we're going to impeach the witnesses
[45:49] because we're going to look at their at
[45:51] the outcome of the witnesses
[45:53] so when brother and said when you go to
[45:55] court then you have to have a witness
[45:57] that has the truth that is an eyewitness
[45:59] to these things and then you've got to
[46:01] have a witness that's inc that's a
[46:03] credible witness to testify
[46:06] because if you've got one that's not
[46:07] then you're going to get up there and
[46:09] you're going to bring the contrary
[46:10] evidence to what they said
[46:13] and then you bring it and say well you
[46:15] know what you're not a credible witness
[46:16] well then you know what then you cancel
[46:18] out that witness's testimony
[46:22] so when we begin to look at here in the
[46:23] scripture when we begin to look at at
[46:25] the witness then you know what when the
[46:27] holy ghost has spoken when will you look
[46:30] then say well is the holy ghost true
[46:33] who is what the holy ghost has spoken is
[46:35] it true does it come to pass
[46:38] but then you take the things that the
[46:39] devil has said and then you say what is
[46:41] he a credible witness
[46:43] he's what the devil has said because you
[46:44] know what we allow him to sit on our
[46:46] shoulder and have a courtroom in our
[46:48] mind and he'll stand there and tell us
[46:50] and talk about into our mind and we'll
[46:52] take up time to listen to what he has to
[46:54] say
[46:55] but is he a credible witness
[46:59] but then when you say well then who are
[47:00] we going to listen to
[47:02] are we going to listen to god are we
[47:04] going to listen
[47:05] to the devil
[47:08] because that's what we do we take up
[47:09] time to listen to what what the devil
[47:11] has to tell us
[47:16] to live in a world
[47:17] of fear
[47:20] and somebody was talking about recently
[47:22] talking about you know the the problem
[47:24] is is living in the in the fear of the
[47:26] unknown
[47:29] but the thing is is if we get into the
[47:31] word and the word is in us and we've
[47:33] we've received the word
[47:36] then we've become the word by receiving
[47:38] the word
[47:39] then then with the word then it becomes
[47:41] known to us it becomes open to us
[47:45] so we're not walking in darkness but
[47:47] we're walking in light
[47:49] now we may not see all things as as paul
[47:52] said but you know we start to but he
[47:53] said we see christ
[47:56] so we're walking in the light as he is
[47:58] in the light
[47:59] so it's not we see everything no but we
[48:01] continue to walk
[48:03] as
[48:04] that man was talking to brother branham
[48:05] and
[48:06] he brother massimo said well how are you
[48:08] going to get home because he said he
[48:10] didn't agree
[48:11] with everything that brother branham had
[48:12] to say about divine healing different
[48:13] things and he said well how are you
[48:15] going to get home he said well i'm just
[48:16] walking in the light
[48:19] he said he said where's your home he
[48:20] said it's over the hill there he said
[48:21] well can you see it no i can't see it
[48:24] well how do you know it's there he said
[48:25] well you know i i've been there i've
[48:27] seen it he said but how do you get there
[48:28] he said i've got to walk this path
[48:31] he said well how you going to walk in
[48:33] the path he said i got this light
[48:36] and he said i'm walking because i can
[48:37] see the path in front of me and i keep
[48:39] walking and he said the further i walk
[48:40] the more the path that i can see and i
[48:42] just keep walking in that path and i
[48:43] keep going forward they said brother he
[48:45] said that's the way it is in the word of
[48:46] god he said we're walking in the light
[48:48] as he is in the light so we just
[48:49] continue to walk in the light that god
[48:51] shines in our way and we begin to keep
[48:53] walking in that way we don't see it all
[48:55] we can't see it all at this time but you
[48:57] know what we're just a daily journey and
[48:59] with god because we know where he's
[49:01] taking us
[49:02] we put our faith in him so we can just
[49:04] walk day by day
[49:07] and have confidence in him
[49:13] this is
[49:14] a read john
[49:17] chapter 8
[49:20] verse 39 says
[49:22] so here's the
[49:24] here's the pharisees speaking to jesus
[49:28] he said they answered and said unto him
[49:30] abraham is our father jesus said unto
[49:32] them if you were abraham's children you
[49:34] would do the works of abraham
[49:37] he said but now ye seek to kill me a man
[49:40] that hath
[49:41] told you the truth which i have heard of
[49:43] god
[49:44] this did not abraham
[49:47] now you seek to kill me
[49:51] you do the works of your father
[49:54] then said they to him
[49:56] we be not born of fornication we have
[49:59] one father even god jesus said unto them
[50:02] jesus said unto them if god were your
[50:04] father you would love me for i proceeded
[50:06] forth and came from god neither came i
[50:08] of myself but he sent me
[50:11] he said why do you not understand my
[50:13] speech
[50:14] even because you cannot hear my word
[50:16] amen
[50:18] he said you are your father the devil in
[50:20] the lust of your father you will do
[50:22] he was a murderer from the beginning and
[50:24] abode not in the truth because there is
[50:27] no truth in him when he speaketh a lie
[50:29] he speaketh of his own for he is a liar
[50:32] and the father of it and because i tell
[50:34] you the truth you believe me not
[50:37] he said which of you convinceth me of
[50:39] sin and if i say the truth why do you
[50:42] not believe me
[50:44] he that is of god heareth god's words
[50:47] ye therefore hear them not because ye
[50:49] are not of god then answered the jews
[50:52] and said unto him say we not well that
[50:55] thou art the samaritan the house of the
[50:57] devil jesus answered i have not a devil
[50:59] but i honor my father and ye do this
[51:01] honor
[51:03] you do dishonor me
[51:04] and i seek not my own glory and there is
[51:07] not one and there is one that seeketh
[51:10] and judgeth verily i say unto you if a
[51:12] man keep my saying he shall never see
[51:15] death
[51:17] so when he when he begins to speak here
[51:20] you know we understand that the the word
[51:23] is the only thing that brings life
[51:26] and you know when he when he begins to
[51:27] speak to him and he and begins to tell
[51:29] them as we as we covered previously you
[51:31] know there was so many things that that
[51:34] the pharisees and and the religious
[51:36] leaders had had spoke about and you know
[51:38] everybody had their own different
[51:39] denomination brother brown talks about
[51:41] you know one believes this and one
[51:43] belief believed that and there was all
[51:44] these different confusions but they all
[51:46] said well we all believe the word we all
[51:48] believe the word it's all the same we
[51:49] believe that jehovah spoke to us and
[51:51] we've heard the word but everybody's got
[51:53] their own idea of what was going to take
[51:54] place but when the when the prophets
[51:56] began to speak then they began to unfold
[51:58] the scripture to to the the word began
[52:01] to unfold to the people then they stood
[52:03] there and
[52:04] he said y'all will go out there and you
[52:06] your fathers who the god had spent sent
[52:09] the prophets to he said they've killed
[52:11] every single one of them and he said he
[52:13] said then they go out and he said y'all
[52:14] are the ones that go out there and
[52:15] polish their tombs you garnish the tombs
[52:17] of the prophets and he said your fathers
[52:19] were the one that killed them because
[52:21] god spoke the word to them and you
[52:22] didn't believe it
[52:23] and he said even today it's the same
[52:25] it's the same thing he said because the
[52:27] word that the prophet spoke of is is the
[52:29] same word
[52:31] that i speak of that is me that is
[52:33] that i am making manifest in this time
[52:35] and he said you don't believe it
[52:37] right he said you don't believe me
[52:40] he said you're of your father the devil
[52:43] it's the same spirit because they didn't
[52:45] because their fathers didn't believe it
[52:46] he said oh we're abraham's seed well
[52:49] abraham rejoiced to see our day abraham
[52:51] rejoiced to see this day he was looking
[52:53] for this day but y'all weren't looking
[52:56] for this day
[52:57] why because they had their own
[52:58] preconceived ideas how how he was going
[53:01] to come how jesus would come and fulfill
[53:04] the scriptures but he began to point
[53:05] them right back to the scriptures to
[53:07] show that the scripture had been
[53:08] fulfilled but they began to miss that
[53:11] but nicodemus come there come to jesus
[53:14] that night and even nicodemus told him
[53:16] said look lord we will still see and
[53:18] understand that no man can do these
[53:20] things except god be with him
[53:22] we know who you are
[53:24] but when they stand in front of the
[53:26] crowds and all of the people they didn't
[53:28] want them to know because they would
[53:30] have to tear down all of the things that
[53:32] they had built all of their ideas and
[53:34] their and their seminaries and all the
[53:36] things that they had built all of that
[53:38] would have to be torn down because they
[53:39] would have to come back and realize you
[53:41] know what we've missed it all
[53:44] right
[53:51] but he was but he began to show the
[53:53] people
[53:54] what was what the truth was
[53:58] and taking them right back to the
[53:59] scripture to show what was spoken in the
[54:01] old testament was exactly what was
[54:03] taking place right then
[54:06] it's the same thing today god is god is
[54:09] here and he has opened the word and and
[54:11] we've we've had a a great ministry in
[54:13] our day to show us these things that
[54:15] were in the scripture
[54:18] but it was all these things that took
[54:19] place it was it was god that done these
[54:22] things in our day but you know you try
[54:24] to point people back to that to show
[54:25] them what exactly what the scripture
[54:27] says
[54:28] but they've missed it
[54:31] and you know
[54:32] we find many people that have walked
[54:34] into this truth and and stood up and
[54:35] proclaimed all these things and now now
[54:37] that you know everybody they spent all
[54:38] their time trying to tear it down
[54:41] but we realized you know that's what god
[54:42] said would take place in the last days
[54:44] there's a great falling away but you
[54:46] know what it it's it's a it's a great
[54:48] time because we see that they see that
[54:50] as well you're just following amanda
[54:52] you're just following error because you
[54:54] can't see the truth but in our day i see
[54:56] it because it's a great rejoicing time
[54:57] because god is showing us what was
[54:59] taking place because he told us these
[55:01] things would take place so when we see
[55:03] these things we're going to take place
[55:04] well then we you know it's time to
[55:06] rejoice and look up because our
[55:07] redemption draws now because we realize
[55:09] these are the things that are supposed
[55:11] to take place in our day
[55:18] and this is uh
[55:22] mark
[55:23] chapter 14 and
[55:25] it's a little bit of a lengthy reading
[55:27] here but uh mark 14
[55:31] beginning verse 44
[55:33] and he said
[55:34] and he that betrayed him had given them
[55:37] a token speaking of this speaking of
[55:39] jesus saying whosoever i shall kiss that
[55:42] kiss is he take him and lead him away
[55:45] safely and as soon as he had come he'd
[55:47] go a straight way to him and said master
[55:50] master and kissed him and they laid
[55:52] their hands on him and took him and one
[55:54] of them that stood by drew a sword and
[55:56] smote a servant of the high priest who
[55:58] cut off his ear and jesus answered and
[56:00] said unto them are ye come out as
[56:03] against the thief with swords and with
[56:05] staves to take me
[56:07] he said i was daily with you in the
[56:08] temple teaching and you took me not but
[56:11] the scriptures must be fulfilled and
[56:14] they all forsook him and fled
[56:16] and there followed him a certain young
[56:18] man having a linen cloth cast about his
[56:21] naked body and the young men laid hold
[56:23] him and he left the linen cloth and fled
[56:25] from them naked and they led jesus away
[56:28] to the high priest with him were
[56:29] assembled all the chief priests and
[56:31] elders and the scribes and peter
[56:33] followed him afar off even into the
[56:35] palace of the high priest and he sat
[56:37] with the servants and warmed himself at
[56:39] the fire and the chief priest and all
[56:42] the council sought for witness against
[56:44] jesus to put him to death and found none
[56:48] for many bear false witness against him
[56:50] but their witness agreed not together
[56:53] and there arose certain and bear false
[56:55] witness against him saying we heard him
[56:58] say i will destroy this temple that is
[57:00] made with hands and within three days i
[57:03] will build another maid without hands
[57:05] but neither did their witness agree
[57:07] together
[57:09] and the high priest stood up in the
[57:10] midst and asked jesus saying answer thou
[57:12] nothing
[57:14] what is it with these
[57:16] which these witness
[57:18] against thee and he held his peace and
[57:20] answered nothing and the high priest
[57:22] asked him and said unto him art thou the
[57:24] christ
[57:25] the son of the blessed and jesus said i
[57:28] am and you shall see the son of man
[57:30] sitting on the right hand of power and
[57:32] coming in the clouds of heaven then the
[57:33] high priest ran his clothes and saith
[57:36] what need we any further witnesses
[57:39] ye have heard the blasphemy what thank
[57:41] ye and they all condemned him to be
[57:43] guilty of death and some began to spit
[57:46] on him and cover his face and to buffet
[57:47] him and to say unto him prophesy and the
[57:50] servants did strike him with the palms
[57:52] of their hands
[57:54] so we see here in the in the scripture
[57:58] you know when that when he come to when
[58:00] he come to take him
[58:05] he was when they when they come to take
[58:06] him you know
[58:10] jesus spoke to him and you know they
[58:12] said listen i i've been with you all
[58:14] this time and spoke
[58:17] and they didn't realize
[58:19] he said you know all this thing has
[58:20] taken place but he said i want you to
[58:22] understand i understand what's taking
[58:24] place
[58:25] he said the scriptures might be
[58:26] fulfilled
[58:28] you know he never he never got into in a
[58:30] situation where he was flustered right
[58:33] or he was he was oh you know worried or
[58:36] feared anything he knew what was taking
[58:37] place so he told him said i understand
[58:39] what's going he said but why are you
[58:40] doing this
[58:41] he's pointing it back to them so y'all
[58:43] don't see this but this is the
[58:45] fulfillment of scripture
[58:47] because you know that's what that's what
[58:48] the scripture said the prophecy would
[58:50] come that i would be that he would be
[58:52] betrayed by one of his own
[58:55] and so as here it is he's speaking to
[58:57] these things and you know he said you
[58:58] come at me like this
[59:00] and he tells peter you know when peter
[59:02] takes the sword and he cuts the high
[59:03] priest here listen this is not the time
[59:05] to do these things
[59:07] don't worry you know look i understand
[59:09] what's taking place and you know
[59:11] peter you know he's he's always the
[59:13] hot-headed one you know he's a little
[59:14] real
[59:15] you know the hot you know little uh
[59:18] quick on the trigger as they say but you
[59:20] know he was a little he's like listen i
[59:22] understand listen this is what's going
[59:23] to take place
[59:26] and we know that even the scripture said
[59:28] that they would come against him and
[59:30] false witness and these things and and
[59:32] the scripture says that here they all of
[59:34] these witness trying to find somebody
[59:35] that's going to stand up but you know he
[59:37] said he said none of their witnesses
[59:40] would would agree
[59:42] they didn't have all of the witnesses i
[59:44] could talk tell about jesus and not a
[59:46] single one could get their story
[59:47] straight
[59:49] and even even when they went to the
[59:51] scripture and they took the exact same
[59:53] thing that jesus told them jesus told
[59:55] him he said you tear down this temple in
[59:57] three days i'll raise it up again and he
[59:59] said they all stood up there and told
[1:00:01] the same story and they couldn't even
[1:00:03] get that one to agree
[1:00:07] and he and not understanding that's the
[1:00:09] scripture
[1:00:10] and so you know and and i want y'all to
[1:00:13] see this morning if we understand that
[1:00:15] even even when people begun to take the
[1:00:17] scripture even when the devil comes and
[1:00:20] speaks to you if he's trying to tell you
[1:00:22] the scripture even when he tries to tell
[1:00:23] a scripture he can't tell it right
[1:00:26] when he was on the mountain with jesus
[1:00:27] and he began to talk to him about the
[1:00:29] scriptures when he began to tell him
[1:00:31] these things he didn't even get the
[1:00:32] scripture right because jesus rebuked
[1:00:34] him with the word went right back to the
[1:00:36] word because he had misplaced the word
[1:00:40] and so you know when everybody begins
[1:00:42] well i'm going to tell you what the
[1:00:43] scripture says well you know what
[1:00:44] there's no place that if you if you're
[1:00:47] true and begin to walk in the light you
[1:00:49] can you cannot turn down any part of the
[1:00:51] word but you know what anybody that
[1:00:53] comes by and wants to wants to change
[1:00:55] the word or whatever if it's not all of
[1:00:58] the word is contrary
[1:01:00] it's contrary to the spirit of god
[1:01:02] because you know what there's always
[1:01:03] going to line up every time
[1:01:05] there's always going to be one word that
[1:01:07] somebody's got to turn down if it's
[1:01:09] going to be contrary to the word of god
[1:01:11] the spirit the antichrist is not going
[1:01:13] to receive every word
[1:01:15] when
[1:01:17] when satan begun coming and spoke to eve
[1:01:19] in the garden see she had to turn down
[1:01:21] one word she had to turn down one word
[1:01:23] to fall
[1:01:25] and so if you're fortified behind the
[1:01:27] word you've got to be fortified behind
[1:01:28] every single word that's when jesus said
[1:01:31] he said man shall not live by bread
[1:01:32] alone he said by every word that
[1:01:34] proceedeth out of the mouth of god so
[1:01:36] it's every word that we must receive
[1:01:38] every word and we receive every word
[1:01:40] then we stand fortified behind it
[1:01:45] he said even even when they begin to
[1:01:47] take the word and try to bring it and
[1:01:49] try to come contrary
[1:01:51] to show that jesus was not right was not
[1:01:54] who he said he was
[1:01:56] trying to show that he had blasphemed
[1:01:58] that he had disbelieved the word and
[1:02:00] even in the time they were trying to
[1:02:01] take the word they couldn't prove that
[1:02:02] it was right
[1:02:04] he said even he said their witness
[1:02:06] couldn't wouldn't agree together
[1:02:12] see it takes the holy ghost
[1:02:15] that's the reason he said he said it's
[1:02:17] not just the word he said but it takes
[1:02:19] the spirit
[1:02:21] he takes the holy ghost to put the word
[1:02:23] together
[1:02:27] what brother brahm said
[1:02:29] he said when he said what we need is a
[1:02:31] revelation
[1:02:34] said it's a revelation he said it's
[1:02:35] because what did he was talking about he
[1:02:38] said you know we don't need a new a new
[1:02:39] book he said we don't we don't need a
[1:02:41] new translation we don't need this he
[1:02:43] said what we need is the spirit
[1:02:46] he said it takes the spirit to put it
[1:02:47] together
[1:02:50] because many people you know he said he
[1:02:52] said you know it's not just comparing
[1:02:54] one scripture to another not one what
[1:02:56] one thing to the other
[1:02:58] but it takes the holy spirit
[1:03:01] because many people have read the
[1:03:02] scripture and have studied the scripture
[1:03:06] and spent their life dedicating their
[1:03:08] life to the study of the scripture
[1:03:11] and reading and everything and they can
[1:03:13] quote the so much of the scripture to
[1:03:15] you and all these things and be able to
[1:03:16] know all these things but the problem is
[1:03:18] is they don't know the author
[1:03:21] when you have somebody that can stand up
[1:03:23] and they know so much of the scripture
[1:03:24] but when it comes when it comes to water
[1:03:26] baptism in jesus name they have no idea
[1:03:29] what you're talking about
[1:03:30] but they've read the scripture cover to
[1:03:32] cover and it's like all of a sudden all
[1:03:33] of a sudden there's there's this
[1:03:34] covering or they don't they don't see
[1:03:36] that
[1:03:37] when they when they don't see how how
[1:03:39] that uh when a prophet is supposed to
[1:03:42] come or how women are supposed to dress
[1:03:44] or anything like that when they when it
[1:03:46] shows it in the scripture and you begin
[1:03:47] to bring these things out and show how
[1:03:49] it is and nobody has any idea what it's
[1:03:51] talking about
[1:03:53] see why because it takes it takes more
[1:03:54] than just reading the scripture it takes
[1:03:56] more than just reading and it takes more
[1:03:58] than just people being around this
[1:04:00] message and saying i believe that
[1:04:01] brother brennan was a prophet well it
[1:04:02] takes more than that because if it
[1:04:04] doesn't if it's not the holy spirit many
[1:04:06] people are standing around and you know
[1:04:08] i believe what i believe what god done
[1:04:10] in our day but it takes more than that
[1:04:12] because it's got to be an indwelling not
[1:04:14] just an anointing
[1:04:16] you know many people you know they they
[1:04:17] live in a realm where you know they get
[1:04:19] so wrapped up and it's all about um
[1:04:21] what what kind of emotions they can have
[1:04:24] in in church and all these things but
[1:04:25] you know it's not it takes more than
[1:04:27] that it takes it takes a life it takes
[1:04:29] an indwelling not just an anointing of
[1:04:31] the spirit people i'm you know i've
[1:04:33] spoken tongues and and i've and you know
[1:04:35] i've had these miracles and these
[1:04:37] different things happen but what you
[1:04:39] know the thing is but do you agree with
[1:04:40] the word
[1:04:42] do you know what the word says when the
[1:04:44] word is presented to you do you accept
[1:04:46] it or do you say well i don't i don't
[1:04:47] you know that's not that's not for me
[1:04:50] or that you know i don't believe that
[1:04:52] my church doesn't teach that
[1:04:56] the thing is is is it what what has been
[1:04:58] said do you put truth in that
[1:05:04] because that's what it takes in this
[1:05:05] hour
[1:05:07] because you know then when you begin to
[1:05:10] see these things then then are you
[1:05:12] listening to what the word says
[1:05:15] are you listening to someone else
[1:05:18] so are you listening so as as we see
[1:05:21] that in the scripture we understand how
[1:05:23] these things are supposed to take place
[1:05:27] so we understand are you going are you
[1:05:29] going to believe what what god has
[1:05:31] showed
[1:05:33] or we believe the devil
[1:05:35] and it's like well we're just going to
[1:05:36] cut a little corners here we're going to
[1:05:38] shave a little this you know we're going
[1:05:40] to get into little gray areas
[1:05:43] no
[1:05:45] because brother brown said you know he's
[1:05:46] like talking about those men riding
[1:05:47] running that
[1:05:48] wagon running on that oh no he's like
[1:05:51] well how close are you going to get to
[1:05:52] the edge
[1:05:54] well i can get this close i can't get
[1:05:56] this close this other man is like no i'm
[1:05:58] hugging the wall he said i'm scraping
[1:05:59] the side of he said i want that fella
[1:06:01] over there
[1:06:03] he said i want the man to get away as
[1:06:04] far as way off the cliff as he can not
[1:06:06] the man that tries to figure out how
[1:06:07] many how many
[1:06:09] microns he's riding on the edge of the
[1:06:10] cliff
[1:06:14] i want to be i want to be the man who
[1:06:15] gets away you know so like when you talk
[1:06:16] about well let's see how how close we
[1:06:18] can get in the world how much we can
[1:06:19] dabble on the edge or you know no we
[1:06:22] don't need any of that
[1:06:24] he said he said resist the devil and
[1:06:26] he'll flee from you he said he said to
[1:06:28] turn away from all
[1:06:29] even the appearance abstain from the
[1:06:31] even the appearance of it
[1:06:34] well you need to shun all of the stuff
[1:06:39] you know just
[1:06:40] even even if it don't even might even
[1:06:42] not even look good we need to be mindful
[1:06:44] of those things to even try to just
[1:06:46] totally shine those things
[1:06:56] brother braham says this is uh
[1:06:59] believe us thou this
[1:07:03] he says now look let's let's think of
[1:07:05] the day of our master reading of the
[1:07:07] text brings us to a spot in his life
[1:07:09] where he become very popular
[1:07:12] he was born with an
[1:07:13] illegitimate accusation against him and
[1:07:15] he came in the way of a stable could you
[1:07:18] imagine and veiled
[1:07:20] and unveiled he was immanuel god was in
[1:07:23] it was in him god was in christ
[1:07:25] reconciling the world to himself and he
[1:07:26] was a king of glory come down and
[1:07:28] tabernacled amongst men making himself
[1:07:30] subject to death that he might taste
[1:07:33] death for all the human race
[1:07:36] in spirit he could not so god created a
[1:07:38] blood cell in the womb of mary that
[1:07:40] brought forth the son christ jesus and
[1:07:42] god dwelt in that body jehovah
[1:07:44] tabernacled in the body of the son which
[1:07:46] was the son of god and here he came
[1:07:48] through
[1:07:50] a main
[1:07:52] barn door
[1:07:53] he lived a humble life no no place to
[1:07:55] lay his head and he went out of the
[1:07:57] world through capital punishment and
[1:07:59] shame and disgrace for us and now he was
[1:08:02] the inside and that was to be lifted up
[1:08:04] and i'm so thankful tonight that he did
[1:08:06] that for me and you
[1:08:08] now after all these years
[1:08:10] we have his favor and fellowship by with
[1:08:13] us by skeptics have a rose up and many
[1:08:15] bob ingersolls and so forth have tried
[1:08:18] to condemn the word and tried to say
[1:08:19] well it was this way and that way and it
[1:08:21] was days past
[1:08:23] but we as a christian holy spirit-filled
[1:08:25] people have the holy spirit as a witness
[1:08:28] of the word see the holy spirit is a
[1:08:30] witness
[1:08:31] now not only the word whatever we want
[1:08:34] to say about it
[1:08:36] that's one thing or another but we know
[1:08:38] that we have the scriptures right here
[1:08:42] we have the scriptures right for we have
[1:08:44] the holy ghost as a witness
[1:08:47] that's the witness so god looking
[1:08:49] down through the optical eye as it was
[1:08:51] and looked down through the magnifying
[1:08:53] glass and seeing the end from the
[1:08:55] beginning why he knew these skeptics
[1:08:57] would rise and try to twist the word in
[1:09:00] and out like that so he said i'll leave
[1:09:02] i'll not leave you comfortless but i'll
[1:09:05] pray the father and he'll send you
[1:09:06] another comforter which is the holy
[1:09:08] ghost and he will abide with you
[1:09:10] and he says until 1950 which is he
[1:09:13] preaches in 51 forever amen that's right
[1:09:16] forever all right
[1:09:17] and he would declare and testify
[1:09:20] of jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:09:22] and forever so we have a wonderful
[1:09:24] witness of that tonight don't we see
[1:09:26] that's right
[1:09:28] he said what kind of people should we be
[1:09:30] then while we should be free and happy
[1:09:32] oh my no condemnation living above sin
[1:09:35] and disgrace
[1:09:36] not by our own
[1:09:40] but by him see not what we are but what
[1:09:43] he is i don't accept god don't accept me
[1:09:46] for what i am he accept me he accepts me
[1:09:49] for what christ has done for me
[1:09:51] it isn't my holiness my righteousness
[1:09:53] it's his
[1:09:55] he said i have nothing to offer but i
[1:09:56] have accepted he is amen so i know he's
[1:09:59] pleased with that for he said this is my
[1:10:01] beloved son in whom i'm well pleased and
[1:10:04] he raised him up from the dead
[1:10:06] and just as he raised him from the dead
[1:10:08] so shall we be raised for he for we are
[1:10:11] his bride flesh of his flesh bone of his
[1:10:14] bone and we shall be with him
[1:10:17] and this is from
[1:10:21] right this is the rising of the sun
[1:10:23] brother brown's taking speaking of the
[1:10:25] the
[1:10:26] mechanics and the dynamics
[1:10:29] they said
[1:10:31] he said that's what he proved hallelujah
[1:10:33] that's what easter proved he wasn't only
[1:10:36] the word but he was god himself the
[1:10:38] dynamics in the word
[1:10:40] that made the body of jesus christ
[1:10:43] cold stiff and dead in the grave shake
[1:10:45] into life and rise again and roll away
[1:10:48] the stone he said i am he that was dead
[1:10:50] so dead till the sun said he was dead
[1:10:52] the moon said he was dead the stars said
[1:10:54] he was dead all nature said he was dead
[1:10:56] and now the whole world has to recognize
[1:10:58] that he's alive again he's not only the
[1:11:01] mechanics god word but he's the dynamics
[1:11:04] to prove it
[1:11:05] he has the dynamics to prove it and as
[1:11:08] he being the groom the bride has to come
[1:11:10] forth because it's part of him and it
[1:11:12] can only be the manifestation of the
[1:11:14] fulfilling of all the revelation any
[1:11:17] others has spoke
[1:11:19] of the bride
[1:11:21] it can only manifest
[1:11:23] if it does something different from the
[1:11:25] groom it isn't the bride because she is
[1:11:27] flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life
[1:11:30] of his life power of his power she is
[1:11:33] him
[1:11:34] as man and woman are one
[1:11:37] and woman
[1:11:38] taken from his side she had taken
[1:11:42] she had taken a spirit the feminist
[1:11:44] spirit from him the flesh
[1:11:46] from his side made both mechanics and
[1:11:49] dynamics the wife the spirit of him and
[1:11:52] the flesh of him and put it together and
[1:11:54] made the die the mechanics and the
[1:11:56] dynamics
[1:11:57] until the church or the people
[1:12:00] so we see that he has
[1:12:03] he was they proved that it was that that
[1:12:05] we had the mechanics but it was the
[1:12:07] dynamics that came through him and he
[1:12:09] said then the bride has the same thing
[1:12:12] she has the she has the we've had the
[1:12:15] mechanics but we have the dynamics now
[1:12:18] but see the thing is we've got to
[1:12:20] recognize that we have the dynamics the
[1:12:22] dynamics is here because it came through
[1:12:25] the word right so when the word came the
[1:12:27] holy spirit was there to quicken the
[1:12:28] word to bring it to pass but the thing
[1:12:31] is is you've got to realize that that's
[1:12:33] that is what's speaking to you
[1:12:35] it's your it's your time it is it is
[1:12:38] your inheritance it's it's for you
[1:12:41] many times he was like well you know
[1:12:43] that's for brother brandon that's for
[1:12:44] brother dale that's for somebody else no
[1:12:45] that's for you many times people want to
[1:12:47] put that on somebody else and say well
[1:12:49] you know we're just waiting on brother
[1:12:50] bob because your brother bob he's the
[1:12:52] he's the one well no brother bob's not
[1:12:54] the one he's not the only one
[1:12:57] because many people they want to put it
[1:12:58] on somebody else no it's you and i have
[1:13:00] to do it each one of us have to have our
[1:13:02] own part you see it's because it's a
[1:13:04] body ministry so it's not just one that
[1:13:07] we're just gonna wait on somebody else
[1:13:08] to do it it's not just one one of us
[1:13:11] that's gonna manifest it it takes every
[1:13:13] one of us to do our part
[1:13:15] and many people you know so if we're
[1:13:16] gonna do it as a whole as a whole group
[1:13:18] it's the whole body it's the whole bride
[1:13:20] that's going to do it
[1:13:22] that's right
[1:13:23] and if we receive that we really realize
[1:13:25] that you know it's mine
[1:13:27] yes we see we have to believe that we
[1:13:29] say well you know that's what well when
[1:13:31] the bride recognizes when now's the time
[1:13:33] to recognize who you are that's what god
[1:13:34] wants to do is he wants you to recognize
[1:13:36] who you are that you have that we've had
[1:13:39] the mechanics but we've got the dynamics
[1:13:41] too
[1:13:42] if we can just light the gasoline we've
[1:13:44] got we've got the car polished up and
[1:13:46] everything and it's ready to go but the
[1:13:47] thing is is we've got to operate it
[1:13:51] it's got to be us it's got to be it's
[1:13:54] our job
[1:13:58] what god has spoken to us
[1:14:02] see we
[1:14:03] understand what god has given us in this
[1:14:05] hour
[1:14:08] for us to do
[1:14:12] here
[1:14:12] in this is uh
[1:14:16] matthew
[1:14:18] chapter 10
[1:14:19] and it says
[1:14:21] jesus speaking said behold i send you
[1:14:23] forth as sheep in the midst of wolves he
[1:14:25] said be ye therefore wisest serpents and
[1:14:27] harmless as doves
[1:14:29] he said but beware of men for they will
[1:14:31] deliver you up to the councils and will
[1:14:34] scourge you in their synagogues and you
[1:14:36] shall be brought before governors and
[1:14:38] kings for my sake for a testimony
[1:14:40] against them and the gentiles
[1:14:42] and when they deliver you up take no
[1:14:44] thought how or what ye shall speak for
[1:14:46] it shall be given you in that same hour
[1:14:48] what ye shall speak
[1:14:50] for it is not ye that speak but the
[1:14:52] spirit of your father which speaketh in
[1:14:54] you
[1:14:55] and the brother shall deliver up the
[1:14:56] brother to death and the father the
[1:14:58] child and the children shall rise up
[1:15:00] against their parents and cause them to
[1:15:02] be put to death and ye shall be hated of
[1:15:04] all men for my sake but he that endureth
[1:15:07] to the end shall be saved
[1:15:09] and when they persecute you in the city
[1:15:11] flee ye into another for verily i see
[1:15:13] unto you ye shall not have gone over the
[1:15:16] cities of of israel till the son of man
[1:15:18] become
[1:15:20] the disciples is not above his master
[1:15:22] nor the servant above his lord it is
[1:15:25] enough for the disciple that he be as
[1:15:29] his master and the servant as his lord
[1:15:31] if they have called the master of the
[1:15:33] house bills above how much more shall
[1:15:35] they
[1:15:36] call them of his household
[1:15:38] fear them not therefore for there is
[1:15:40] nothing covered that shall not be
[1:15:43] revealed and hid that shall not be known
[1:15:45] what i tell you in darkness that speak
[1:15:48] ye in light and what ye hear in the ear
[1:15:50] that preach ye unto the housetops
[1:15:53] and fear not them which shall kill the
[1:15:55] body but are not able to kill the soul
[1:15:58] but rather fear him which is able to
[1:16:00] destroy both
[1:16:02] the body
[1:16:04] both soul and body inhale
[1:16:07] so we begin to speak
[1:16:09] you know when he begins to speak here
[1:16:11] you know
[1:16:13] we see what was good
[1:16:15] they're going to come against you
[1:16:18] you know as he's telling the disciples
[1:16:20] here you know listen these are things
[1:16:22] that's going to take place and if he and
[1:16:23] he spoke the way he spoke of me and then
[1:16:26] he's going to speak of you
[1:16:28] it's coming against you the same way
[1:16:30] and you know and it's the same way as it
[1:16:32] is in in the same way today
[1:16:35] not just what it was to them but it's to
[1:16:37] every believer you know every every
[1:16:38] believer has uh in every age has been
[1:16:41] the outcast
[1:16:43] has been the scourge of the earth has
[1:16:45] always had everybody turned against them
[1:16:48] but he said he said you know when you
[1:16:49] when you come into these situations when
[1:16:51] you go and you have to be brought before
[1:16:53] all these he said don't worry about what
[1:16:55] you got to say
[1:16:57] he said he's one because the words will
[1:16:58] be given to you
[1:17:00] you know many times when when things
[1:17:02] come to you and you know somebody will
[1:17:03] ask you a question or whatever happens
[1:17:05] different things you know something i
[1:17:07] just pray lord just give me what needs
[1:17:09] to be said because sometimes i amaze
[1:17:11] myself at what i say
[1:17:13] why because when when somebody asks a
[1:17:15] question sometimes you don't want to you
[1:17:17] don't even know how to answer the
[1:17:18] question you know brother i was
[1:17:20] listening to brother branham and he was
[1:17:21] talking about uh the brother that come
[1:17:23] and asked him about the serpent's seat
[1:17:25] and you know then he was standing there
[1:17:27] and he's like lord how am i going to
[1:17:28] answer this question
[1:17:30] but you know the lord gave him the
[1:17:31] answer it's right here yes right so you
[1:17:33] know when when the lord comes and you
[1:17:35] know you just trust him
[1:17:37] he said don't have to work because it's
[1:17:39] not it's not us that's going to answer
[1:17:41] the
[1:17:42] question because when those questions
[1:17:45] come up you know then he will always
[1:17:47] have his answer he will always have a
[1:17:49] witness
[1:17:50] that's going to answer these questions
[1:17:53] but i love that when he said he said
[1:17:54] when he speak to these things he said
[1:17:56] you know you don't have to you don't
[1:17:57] have to hide
[1:18:00] you don't have you don't have to back up
[1:18:02] he said when you hear these things he
[1:18:04] said
[1:18:04] preach them from the housetops
[1:18:08] you know as as people always you know
[1:18:10] they want to try to put put the the
[1:18:13] message down and put things back you
[1:18:14] know these things weren't done in a back
[1:18:17] room somewhere
[1:18:19] they weren't hit because you know they
[1:18:20] have been preached all around the world
[1:18:24] and you know brother i'm standing up
[1:18:25] there in chicago in front of 300
[1:18:27] ministers of the chicago the greater
[1:18:29] chicago ministerial association want to
[1:18:32] question him on his doctrine
[1:18:37] and brother tommy hicks and all them
[1:18:38] were standing up there and he was and he
[1:18:40] began to speak about those things and he
[1:18:42] stood there and he told brother tommy he
[1:18:43] said brother tell me he said you
[1:18:44] preached for me to not he said you know
[1:18:46] you get up and speak and he said brother
[1:18:48] brown i couldn't do that i can't do that
[1:18:49] i can't do that he said why
[1:18:52] he said yeah you know i would do
[1:18:54] anything for you and i you know you said

[1:18:58] can't do that no
[1:19:00] that's my brother ram tom said listen
[1:19:02] bro tommy he said that's what he said
[1:19:04] they got a trap set for me
[1:19:06] he said they're coming after me
[1:19:08] he said we're not even going to be in
[1:19:09] the room that you think we're going to
[1:19:10] be in
[1:19:12] all of it was laid out brother brown
[1:19:14] told them exactly how things were going
[1:19:16] to take place what would take place and
[1:19:17] when they walked in there exactly where
[1:19:19] everybody was going to sit and
[1:19:20] everything how everything was going to
[1:19:21] be that night
[1:19:25] and stood there and told him he said
[1:19:26] well come here he said yo he said y'all
[1:19:28] want to question me on the baptism of
[1:19:30] the holy ghost and baptism of jesus name
[1:19:31] and all these things he said well bring
[1:19:33] your bibles and come here
[1:19:38] this message went all the way around the
[1:19:40] world
[1:19:41] brother brown said i traveled to europe
[1:19:42] he said i've traveled around the world
[1:19:44] seven times
[1:19:47] see he's not he's not left the world
[1:19:48] without a witness
[1:19:51] he's not been not been hidden somewhere
[1:19:53] or whatever
[1:19:57] but if but if the same jesus that
[1:19:59] brought him up from the that brought
[1:20:01] jesus from the dead
[1:20:03] and he said if he dwells in you if he's
[1:20:05] the same one see you didn't make brother
[1:20:07] branham anything but it made god
[1:20:08] everything and if it's the same one that
[1:20:11] was there when brother branham stood
[1:20:13] behind that pulpit and said this is the
[1:20:15] word he said bring your bibles and let's
[1:20:17] see if it stands the truth or not
[1:20:19] if it's the same if it's the same one
[1:20:21] that it's the same life that lives
[1:20:23] inside of you it's the same one then you
[1:20:25] know what if it's the same jesus christ
[1:20:27] if we're the sting that was that is the
[1:20:29] same
[1:20:30] bone of his bone flesh of his flesh life
[1:20:32] of his life if it's all the same then
[1:20:34] you know what we can do the exact same
[1:20:36] thing we don't have to back up we don't
[1:20:38] have to stand back you know we can stand
[1:20:40] and claim our god-given rights
[1:20:42] what god has given us because it's the
[1:20:44] truth
[1:20:46] and it will stand the test of time it
[1:20:48] has stan it has stood the test of time
[1:20:50] but whatever god has given you then then
[1:20:53] you can claim it and believe it
[1:20:56] but the thing is is god has in our day
[1:20:59] has spoken and has revealed his self and
[1:21:02] revealed the word to us and that is and
[1:21:04] it was a witness to us to show us these
[1:21:06] things all the infallible proofs that
[1:21:08] we've seen because you can say
[1:21:10] is there anybody in this building that
[1:21:12] can raise your hand and say you've not
[1:21:13] seen god move in your life
[1:21:17] then we've seen god how many people can
[1:21:18] stand and say i've seen god move i've
[1:21:20] seen the supernatural in my life there's
[1:21:22] things that i know what god has done for
[1:21:24] me then you know we can stand and claim
[1:21:26] what god has done for us but you know
[1:21:27] what then the satan and as we've seen
[1:21:30] and what satan has done because
[1:21:32] everything that he has done is contrary
[1:21:35] we know what the scripture said that his
[1:21:37] end will be
[1:21:40] well because we we know how of all the
[1:21:42] things that he has done in your life and
[1:21:44] all the things that he has done
[1:21:46] we don't even have to read the scripture
[1:21:48] when we look at what he's done but if we
[1:21:49] just go back to what what the devil has
[1:21:52] done in our lives of what he's tried to
[1:21:54] do and we know what god has done for us
[1:21:56] to overcome the power of satan then you
[1:21:58] know that we can say why are we
[1:22:00] listening to him
[1:22:03] why don't we even entertain the time
[1:22:05] that the devil has to come and tell us
[1:22:07] things that are contrary to what he says
[1:22:11] one time every time you get a little
[1:22:12] little chest pain a little backache you
[1:22:15] go to something other and it's all well
[1:22:16] that's a heart attack
[1:22:20] how many times how many times how many
[1:22:23] people in here has had a kidney stone
[1:22:27] how many times you ever get a backache
[1:22:28] somebody's like oh oh
[1:22:30] guinea stone that's a kidney song
[1:22:34] i don't know kidney stone it's a
[1:22:35] backache
[1:22:38] i don't sign for that package that's
[1:22:40] right
[1:22:40] i had i had one and i told him i said i
[1:22:42] don't wish that on my worst enemy
[1:22:45] i had to have surgery to get that thing
[1:22:47] busted up i tell you what i wouldn't
[1:22:48] want to have to go through that again
[1:22:51] i know what it is to pray for somebody
[1:22:52] when they say i got a kidney stone i
[1:22:53] know how to pray for people
[1:22:57] sarah can tell you i had one i was
[1:22:58] rolling around in the bathroom floor i
[1:22:59] didn't think i was ever gonna make it
[1:23:03] i didn't know what was wrong with me i
[1:23:04] was hurt so bad i thought somebody was
[1:23:06] splitting me apart
[1:23:09] but you know we listen to satan he's
[1:23:10] going to tell us all about all these
[1:23:11] things about well you know what you're
[1:23:13] not going to get well
[1:23:16] or your children aren't going to make it
[1:23:20] or you're or you can't pay your bills or
[1:23:23] whatever's going to happen you're going
[1:23:24] to lose your job you're not going to get
[1:23:26] the job or whatever's going whatever the
[1:23:28] problem is
[1:23:31] i stole i was told brother sister dale
[1:23:33] was over at the house over their house
[1:23:34] the other night you know what's how
[1:23:36] about brother dale i always stay it's
[1:23:37] always stood with me always stayed with
[1:23:39] me
[1:23:40] you know years ago brother brother
[1:23:42] sometimes like the lord spoke to him and
[1:23:43] told him he said he said you know i've
[1:23:44] taken care of you this long
[1:23:47] all these years he said i'll take care
[1:23:49] of the rest of the way
[1:23:54] what's to say it's the same it doesn't
[1:23:56] matter you know because we're all god's
[1:23:58] children well if we're all god's
[1:24:00] children then you know what he doesn't
[1:24:01] do something for one that he won't do
[1:24:03] for the other that's right
[1:24:05] god ain't got any favorites
[1:24:10] now you know sometimes when your parents
[1:24:12] you know down
[1:24:13] in and being early parents know when
[1:24:15] you've got multiple children you know
[1:24:17] it's kind of hard sometimes to try to
[1:24:18] make everything even it don't always
[1:24:20] work out that way
[1:24:22] but you know what god don't do one for
[1:24:23] that he won't do for the other one
[1:24:25] that's right
[1:24:26] he said well because he said he said
[1:24:28] that we are heirs of god and joint heirs
[1:24:30] with christ
[1:24:33] well then whatever he god we got the
[1:24:34] same thing
[1:24:36] then we don't have to we don't have to
[1:24:37] worry about what god has done for us
[1:24:39] because if it's the same thing that god
[1:24:41] done for one he's going to do for the
[1:24:42] other one then if if he's done it for
[1:24:44] one and we've seen it take place then
[1:24:46] you know what we can claim the exact
[1:24:48] same thing
[1:24:50] but you know we give because really we
[1:24:51] don't give place to the devil we don't
[1:24:53] listen to what he has to say people get
[1:24:55] out and they try to run down this
[1:24:57] message and tear it all to pieces and
[1:24:58] then but you know what
[1:25:00] god has given the truth and you know
[1:25:01] what when it comes the time it's always
[1:25:04] come to pass that somebody's been just
[1:25:06] like they got out there talking about
[1:25:07] you know you know there wasn't the cloud
[1:25:09] was wrong and all this is all man-made
[1:25:11] all kind of stuff and then somebody
[1:25:12] comes along when brother bill comes
[1:25:14] roster and come along and proved
[1:25:16] everything he's like well you know what
[1:25:17] y'all don't want to believe the word of
[1:25:18] god well let me tell you when you look
[1:25:20] at something scientific then you tell me
[1:25:22] how it was not supernatural
[1:25:26] if you've not seen the videos i
[1:25:27] encourage you to see them
[1:25:30] now there might be sometimes when people
[1:25:32] start listening to that when brother
[1:25:33] bill gets in there they gets over in the
[1:25:35] weeds sometimes and people think well
[1:25:36] brother bill's way over my head that's
[1:25:38] all right you just keep listening to him
[1:25:40] and brother bill get to the point where
[1:25:41] you realize there's only one thing that
[1:25:43] brought that cloud into being there with
[1:25:45] brother branham out there in arizona and
[1:25:47] that was god that was a supernatural
[1:25:49] event and i don't care what anybody has
[1:25:51] to say they can try to tear it down
[1:25:52] everything that brother branham has ever
[1:25:54] said to always try to tear it down but
[1:25:55] you know what god has had a witness in
[1:25:58] this day to show what the truth is
[1:26:00] [Music]
[1:26:01] when they when they when they tried to
[1:26:03] talk about brother brown talking about
[1:26:05] the bridge and all these other events
[1:26:07] and all these things god has always had
[1:26:09] a witness to show that it was the truth
[1:26:12] and then the other thing is is people
[1:26:14] say well it's it's you know they have
[1:26:17] well it's not the truth or whatever but
[1:26:18] you know what god has raised up a group
[1:26:20] of people that stand and walking in the
[1:26:23] truth and they say well you know it's
[1:26:25] it's hard to live this life or whatever
[1:26:27] more you know what god has had a group
[1:26:29] and he's got a bride that he's showing
[1:26:31] that he's going to show the satan he
[1:26:32] said she's not going to fall like like
[1:26:34] the other eve
[1:26:36] there's going to be one that's going to
[1:26:37] stand up and they're going to walk
[1:26:38] they'll walk and they're going to take a
[1:26:40] body change and no nothing that he can
[1:26:42] do is ever going to stop that why
[1:26:44] because he's given us the proof he's
[1:26:46] given us the life and because he did it
[1:26:48] he said because i've done it you can do
[1:26:50] it you will do also the same things that
[1:26:53] i've done he said shall you do also and
[1:26:55] so we've seen these things but we've got
[1:26:57] to believe the witness
[1:26:59] so while we've seen what every time
[1:27:02] because all you all it takes i'm gonna
[1:27:04] stop here in a minute i promise you but
[1:27:05] when we we say one time all it takes is
[1:27:08] one time
[1:27:09] when you have a witness in court when
[1:27:11] they fail one time
[1:27:13] all it takes is one lie to catch them at
[1:27:15] one inconsistency
[1:27:18] one inconsistent statement one false
[1:27:20] statement and you know what you can you
[1:27:22] can disbar that witness you can remove
[1:27:24] that witness well how many times have
[1:27:26] you seen that
[1:27:28] satan come to you and tell you something
[1:27:30] that's not be right
[1:27:32] how many times has he come and tried to
[1:27:34] tell you that you're not going to you're
[1:27:35] not who you are and you're not going to
[1:27:37] get what you have need of and all these
[1:27:39] things he's come against you and you've
[1:27:40] seen the devil thwarted when you've seen
[1:27:43] the devil defeated every single time and
[1:27:45] you know what if it's only been one time
[1:27:47] that you know what the devil's defeated
[1:27:49] we already but we already know by the
[1:27:50] word of god that he's already defeated
[1:27:52] even today
[1:27:56] he can't he doesn't have any legs
[1:27:58] doesn't he have a place to stand doesn't
[1:28:00] have anything to stand on doesn't have a
[1:28:01] leg to stand on and he's already
[1:28:03] defeated but you know what we will steal
[1:28:06] in our human mind in our human existence
[1:28:08] still let take the time in our day to
[1:28:11] listen to what he has to say
[1:28:16] so what we need to do is just say listen
[1:28:18] you're dead you're gone
[1:28:22] but you know we'll people will still
[1:28:24] listen and you know when when the devil
[1:28:26] comes and and the doctor's got these
[1:28:28] things to tell you you know you've got
[1:28:30] all these issues and all these problems
[1:28:31] no
[1:28:33] i don't have any of them i'm not
[1:28:35] accepting them
[1:28:38] i don't have to i don't have to accept
[1:28:40] any of those things
[1:28:42] what did he give us he gave us the word
[1:28:46] hebrews 4. he said he's quick and power
[1:28:48] is sharper sharper than any two-edged
[1:28:50] sword
[1:28:51] anything anything that comes against us
[1:28:53] we have we have the
[1:28:55] weapon of choice to destroy that power
[1:28:58] that whatever it comes that situation
[1:29:00] whatever it is we've got the weapon of
[1:29:02] choice to destroy it
[1:29:06] we're going to have have the musicians
[1:29:08] coming and i i just want to read this
[1:29:10] one
[1:29:10] this one last quote here
[1:29:14] and this is from oneness
[1:29:16] you know brother i'm talking about the
[1:29:19] he talks about the sword in the hand
[1:29:22] you know that sword he said he said you
[1:29:23] know when you have a fight you've got
[1:29:25] two people with swords and he said he
[1:29:27] said we've got the sword which is the
[1:29:28] word of god and he said the devil don't
[1:29:30] even have a sword he said he's got a
[1:29:31] stick
[1:29:35] so he's got he's got a stick he said he
[1:29:37] don't have a sword
[1:29:39] he said how is he going to battle he
[1:29:41] don't even have a he don't even have a
[1:29:43] real weapon to fight with
[1:29:49] he said oh god this is from oneness
[1:29:52] he said oh god how how i could think
[1:29:54] when the church was on the move when
[1:29:56] moses got a little scared down up there
[1:29:58] at the sea he began to cry to the lord
[1:30:00] and the lord said why are you crying to
[1:30:03] me
[1:30:04] what are you
[1:30:05] what are you crying to me
[1:30:07] speak and go forward haven't i
[1:30:09] commissioned you to to the job speak
[1:30:12] speak what speak the word of god it's in
[1:30:14] you
[1:30:15] speak and go forward don't cry unto me

[1:30:18] forward so when if if he give the
[1:30:21] commission to moses then you know what
[1:30:24] brothers and sisters he's given us the
[1:30:25] commission too

[1:30:30] us acts 1 he said but you shall receive
[1:30:32] power that when the holy ghost is come
[1:30:35] upon you and you shall be witnesses
[1:30:38] so you're going to be a witness to these
[1:30:40] things
[1:30:41] and he said and lord god today i come in
[1:30:43] the name of jesus christ i'm yielding
[1:30:45] this sword of faith
[1:30:47] claiming the oneness of god in man by
[1:30:48] the holy ghost through the mercies and
[1:30:50] sacrifice of jesus christ his son he
[1:30:53] said i defy every devil that's bound

[1:32:04] in god's word to claim it to be your
