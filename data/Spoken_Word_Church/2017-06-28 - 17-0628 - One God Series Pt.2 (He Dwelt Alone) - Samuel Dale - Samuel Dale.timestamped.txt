[3:23] that all things that we could be
[3:26] speaking about we can rejoice in you to
[3:30] think about the day in the hour that
[3:32] we're living in the time
[3:34] that you have allowed us to be able to
[3:38] come to an understanding
[3:40] that mankind has never before understood
[3:43] because they've always sought after some
[3:46] way to understand you and to make you
[3:49] out of what you are and what your being
[3:51] but yet you have shown yourself unto us
[3:55] through the opening of the word here in
[3:56] the last days we thank you we ask you to
[3:59] just have your way remember somewhere
[4:01] away traveling tonight Joyce and Danny
[4:04] in them and many others it announced
[4:06] that they'll be gone for the weekends
[4:08] and time and just this you just be with
[4:11] each and every one take care of give a
[4:13] safe journey and bring us all back
[4:14] together and you because that's our
[4:16] desire we love you and we thank you and
[4:19] we commit it all to you now in Jesus
[4:21] name you mean you'd like to turn there
[4:24] to us John one we use this this past
[4:30] Sunday we'll go from one to five and
[4:35] then we jump to verse 18 in the
[4:40] beginning was the word and the Word was
[4:42] with God and the Word was God the same
[4:45] was in the beginning with God all things
[4:47] were made by him I notice what it I mean
[4:52] this is where I read you're talking
[4:54] about word word word now it says him me
[4:59] trying to make it more real personal all
[5:04] things were made by him who the word and
[5:07] without him was not anything made that
[5:09] was made
[5:10] now we know it we're all made by Jesus
[5:12] Christ right Ephesians 3:9 cautions 1
[5:15] John 1 a bruised one all the scriptures
[5:18] saying Jesus Christ not Jesus the flesh
[5:22] Jesus the Christ is the Creator God
[5:24] all right and him was life and the life
[5:27] was a lot of men and the light shines in
[5:29] darkness and the darkness comprehended
[5:30] it not there's no way the darkness can
[5:34] understand God it first takes light
[5:39] light brother Louie's speaking on it
[5:43] here a few weeks ago you know it first
[5:45] takes light to have an understanding
[5:48] then we can talk about it alright verse
[5:50] 18 says no man has seen God at any time
[5:55] but I like this the only begotten Son
[5:58] which is in the bosom of the Father he
[6:00] hath declared him or brought him out in
[6:04] other words unveiled him revealed him
[6:06] brought him out will now remember see if
[6:09] we can read one scripture no man has
[6:12] seen God see God in the same God me it
[6:20] said that we're in verse chapter 14
[6:23] verse 9 jesus said unto Him have I been
[6:28] sold on the word Philip saith unto Him
[6:31] Lord show us the father that it's a
[6:33] father satisfies us jesus said unto Him
[6:36] have I been so long time with you and
[6:39] yet hast thou not known me Philip
[6:42] he said have seen me has seen the father
[6:48] no oh here he said you you can't see God
[6:53] now he's saying if you've seen him you
[6:56] say God all right he's declaring him
[6:59] right he's bringing him out he's
[7:01] revealing him okay but you'd be able to
[7:04] see him through that way all right
[7:06] now leave us now not that I am in the
[7:10] father and the father in me the works
[7:13] did I the words that I speak unto you I
[7:15] speak not of myself but the father that
[7:18] dwelleth in me he doeth the works
[7:20] believe me that I am in the father and
[7:23] the father in me what now watch our else
[7:27] believe me for the very works sake if
[7:31] you don't want to believe it just look
[7:34] around and see what's taking place at
[7:38] least you can believe it from that right
[7:40] so you can be seen as Lord that is
[7:42] blessing to the reading of the word now
[7:44] I don't want to back up too far but I
[7:46] want to us to keep the thought because
[7:51] the thought is still built even though
[7:53] I'll subtitle it different for a couple
[7:55] of messages but it still how real is
[7:59] your God
[8:03] how real is your god to all mankind
[8:10] they've always wanted some way to see
[8:14] God they went crazy as the Prophet said
[8:19] trying to write about him trying to
[8:22] think about him but you mean to tell me
[8:30] now that there is a great eternal God as
[8:34] we covered Sunday that has to be greater
[8:37] than anything we can see real because he
[8:42] made it
[8:43] that's simple terminology right so you
[8:47] you can go and get metal that is so hard
[8:51] until you know there's impossible even
[8:54] penetrate it with other objects or
[8:56] something because it's so hard but yet
[9:03] it had to have a creator and the creator
[9:07] had to be greater than the product
[9:11] because if not what kind of a God do you
[9:14] have is that simple is that simple
[9:17] thinking some simple-minded I have a 9th
[9:20] grade education I can't come up with a
[9:21] great theological things and say them I
[9:24] just say what I think for me to think
[9:28] about God has always been the greatest
[9:31] opportunity that you could think of in
[9:34] life to think that God would in this
[9:38] life days reveal himself under a group
[9:43] of people that we could realize he's
[9:49] real we could realize that he is so real
[9:57] that he's a being not like a myth or our
[10:03] floating around that we could even know
[10:07] his name but his name is Jesus
[10:13] and that we can see him or what it looks
[10:22] like maybe not him but what he looks
[10:26] like all by way of God sending a prophet
[10:34] for you and I to understand the Word of
[10:38] God
[10:39] all right you know that Rhett Dyer would
[10:43] be enough to rejoice till midnight to
[10:46] think about those little things to know
[10:50] that he's real they know he's a being
[10:54] didn't know his name and to be able to
[10:59] see what he looked like
[11:04] and remember they always say your
[11:09] prophet said and when I say it that way
[11:14] because you're the ones claiming he's a
[11:18] prophet I don't have no problems really
[11:20] I'm quoting that he is and always a
[11:24] study that is the point is is you claim
[11:30] him to be a prophet so why would we be
[11:35] quoting from somebody else or somebody
[11:38] else's ideas I remember an incident
[11:42] happened years ago here and some of them
[11:44] went to a church and they came back and
[11:47] one of the brothers especially we're
[11:49] talking about
[11:50] well the brother said so-and-so about
[11:52] God and said God is just floating around
[11:55] the Miller I said but that ain't right I
[12:01] said he's a being well he said it to him
[12:06] I said well why didn't he say to him he
[12:10] was saying brother Branham was saying it
[12:13] well it's all right do you to say what
[12:16] you want to but then when you say
[12:18] brother Branham said it I want to read
[12:20] it
[12:22] now I'm not liking what we're talking
[12:25] about news talking about it Sunday and
[12:27] wage we're talking about it we've been
[12:29] talking about you don't have to quote me
[12:31] everything you just tell me something
[12:35] I'll tell you where it's right or not
[12:41] from my own experience where were you
[12:46] what were you then that goes back to the
[12:48] who were used idea he said well that
[12:51] silly it is silly
[12:53] my whole point is the Bible tells us the
[12:57] truth and it said you shall know the
[13:00] truth and the truth shall set you free
[13:04] that does not say you shall know about
[13:07] truth till people come along and they
[13:11] bring up all kind of of Bibles and new
[13:15] ones and it's not the other one because
[13:17] they're not set on the King James being
[13:21] right if they believe it's right why
[13:27] when they come up with more see I just
[13:31] have to believe that and just leave it
[13:33] well you don't have enough education to
[13:34] be able to understand these other
[13:35] translations well there's no problem if
[13:39] they all reveal the same then I want no
[13:41] problem to see it and understanding it
[13:43] all right now but to get to the thoughts
[13:49] how real is your God is it capable of or
[14:01] is he capable of revealing himself to
[14:07] where mankind can understand him and I
[14:12] thought right around it I blues Christ
[14:13] mister God revealed he's talking about
[14:15] the new birth and thing and he said he
[14:17] could be revealed to the most illiterate
[14:21] person
[14:25] we see we think what they can't
[14:27] understand that because they're
[14:28] illiterate
[14:30] all of the shop was very literate as far
[14:33] as because I mean literate is for human
[14:36] educational ability because if you don't
[14:39] have a high school diploma you know I've
[14:41] got one but if you don't have one of
[14:44] those then you're considered illiterate
[14:46] and now high school diploma is almost
[14:49] illiterate you know if you don't have
[14:51] more than that you ain't going to get a
[14:53] good job you know but think about it how
[15:00] real is your God
[15:02] now we use this statement Sunday talking
[15:07] about that the Prophet said one day and
[15:09] made an outstanding statement on who is
[15:11] this Melchizedek when he said in the
[15:16] beginning but before the eternal so you
[15:24] can't do that you can't go back Pais
[15:26] that well on that message we'll get back
[15:33] to it probably a little later on that
[15:35] message he talks about going back into
[15:38] the mind of God then we talked about
[15:46] Sunday worth it and read the scriptures
[15:50] are on second Corinthians where it tells
[15:55] about Paul said he was taken up to the
[15:59] third heaven and saw things that were
[16:05] not lawful to speak off but right and
[16:10] said he went to the first heaven did he
[16:12] believe that if I went to the third well
[16:18] how about it is it more heavens besides
[16:22] us or whatever I don't know none of my
[16:25] business I'm just saying the Bible tells
[16:27] me there's that many right the prophet
[16:32] verifies there's that many so then we
[16:35] ought to be able to listen and think
[16:36] about
[16:40] the great eternal God is what I was
[16:42] trying to get at Sunday - you see our
[16:47] thoughts and ideas of an eternal God or
[16:50] a self existing one it's just like in
[16:52] the old quote brother Branham and say
[16:55] there was no ire there was no star there
[16:58] was no dish none of that you know
[17:00] existing well we just think that God is
[17:04] none existing and the best we can say is
[17:08] he's the spirit we got up into the
[17:15] message are talking about Sunday where
[17:19] the prophet calls himself existing and
[17:22] calls him Ella him and that's the best
[17:26] word or the only word mankind can use to
[17:30] define the self existing one is to say
[17:33] hello him right and then in doing that
[17:37] we can think about back before the world
[17:43] that he was real well it's just a spirit
[17:49] so I guess you means he's mister spirit
[17:53] season that's where somebody like me
[17:55] coming along and you don't like me
[17:57] because see if you say well God is just
[18:00] a spirit is well he made my answer man
[18:05] sister spirit one of the probably said
[18:08] in like mental spiritual he said he made
[18:10] him a spiritual being
[18:13] you don't read them to you
[18:16] he'll read where he said God was the
[18:19] great Jehovah dwelling alone nothing
[18:26] existed with him yet it was real
[18:36] my elder brother brother nobody can
[18:40] understand them great supernatural
[18:42] timing cause even the great scholars
[18:45] thank you're not trying to make him
[18:48] harder when Jesus came he walked up on
[18:55] the shores of Galilee and talked to a
[18:57] bunch of little fishermen they were
[18:59] ignorant unlearned before he ever went
[19:02] to the high priest why because he knew
[19:06] that only one is believing and he knew
[19:09] the high priest went on believing right
[19:10] I real we think that he he come this way
[19:18] did he become real he came this way to
[19:23] show how real he is we'll get back to it
[19:29] later when we talk about the attributes
[19:31] of God I've made that statement for 40
[19:34] years that God never gained one
[19:37] attribute by coming into the world and
[19:39] doing all he's done he had all those
[19:42] attributes in him when he was self
[19:45] existing is that true well why would we
[19:52] think about attribute so being any other
[19:54] than the fact that they could dwell with
[19:55] him but yet he could be self existing
[20:00] nothing didn't exist with him but in
[20:04] that part dark he says there's a great
[20:11] supernatural being Jehovah God that
[20:16] second from which is an answer on
[20:19] Genesis
[20:24] he said Abraham you remember that then
[20:29] Abraham seen God many times they said
[20:38] one day he saw him as milk etc then wade
[20:46] bringing out you if you're doing twice
[20:48] as much as early put that same example
[20:57] and you'll follow into what I'm thinking
[21:00] about put that same example he met him
[21:03] here he met him here he met him here he
[21:06] met him here within he seen Moses met
[21:12] him here let him hear let him hear
[21:15] then he seen think about that is their
[21:24] prophet in the last days we talked about
[21:28] do you seen God in many forms appeared
[21:33] too many times in many forms in many
[21:35] ways why but one day he's seen you do
[21:43] you believe he's seen you I mean at
[21:47] least we're to be able to get anchored
[21:48] down on that and whether or not we
[21:51] believe he's seeing if short saved me a
[21:53] lot of trouble if you take that and
[21:56] believe it but they don't know they
[21:58] prove it to you we follow the prophets
[22:02] message and don't worry about it
[22:05] what about getting over to a place that
[22:08] we begin to talk about we talk about the
[22:12] self existing one and that that self
[22:18] existing one was the great eternal God
[22:25] real not just the spirit
[22:34] before the world before anything I mean
[22:39] do you think it was just fun there's
[22:41] nothing and then some way you begin to
[22:47] farm to do well you know that a much
[22:52] further along sorry then the evolution
[22:57] theory that somehow they wound up being
[23:02] a Polliwog and the Polliwog later over
[23:07] on one side for so many millions of
[23:09] years and growing arm he turned over on
[23:12] the other side like so many million
[23:14] groats another arm to use it you think
[23:22] like that that's the way I think what's
[23:24] the difference in an evolution of theory
[23:28] if you to take your theory of just
[23:32] nothing remember
[23:43] whatever you want to think about we live
[23:48] in life light and matter there's a
[23:54] fourth dimension above that which is
[23:58] demons spirits TVs proves it and tons of
[24:02] because it just turned it on higher
[24:04] division I never didn't understand I or
[24:07] limb people no John Wayne movies it that
[24:11] used to love so much and call them
[24:12] horses and all within that one little
[24:15] wire running in the back of that TV I
[24:18] couldn't comprehend that but what about
[24:24] it you see what I believe now listen
[24:28] here's what I believe alright I believe
[24:31] of how real you can think God is now he
[24:36] was that before anything ever existed
[24:48] come on we live in an atmosphere and
[24:55] it's called heaven above us right that's
[24:56] it's the human terminology right the
[24:59] heavens
[24:59] it just means simply up above within
[25:03] words the second third what he'll God
[25:13] himself existed in the third dimension
[25:17] our third heaven what were the words or
[25:20] terminologies third heaven to be
[25:23] scriptural you don't believe he was real
[25:28] in that situation
[25:38] you're not listening and thinking about
[25:39] what I'm getting at if there is a third
[25:42] heaven they polish all things then there
[25:47] was something dark to see is that simple
[25:54] you know I mean he said he saw things
[25:58] that were not lawful to speak of it he
[26:05] saw something what if he went at work
[26:09] God was before the world or anything
[26:12] ever existed we realized we're held in a
[26:20] frame of the world and all of the
[26:22] planets and the stars is just one heaven
[26:29] it's not that you go out so many stars
[26:31] and you get out to face the moon and
[26:34] there's another heaven this is one you
[26:38] call it atmosphere heavens place or
[26:44] whatever and it contained all of the
[26:47] planets all of the moons all of the
[26:50] stars is in this dimensional situation
[26:55] or whatever you want to call it a life
[26:58] light and matter right
[27:06] but what about two more heavens above
[27:08] there you said well so brother there
[27:15] you're trying to get us to believe that
[27:17] God is real that he was back there as
[27:20] himself I said that's exactly what I'm
[27:21] trying to do I'm trying to believe it
[27:24] myself
[27:29] not to say that you had to wait until he
[27:32] came in human flesh to be able to
[27:33] believe that he comes become real like
[27:39] I've told you over and over and over
[27:41] people don't like me because of that
[27:45] when I say son of God not eternal son
[27:51] ships with the son of God was the logos
[27:55] the word Jesus Christ that created all
[27:58] things back dark where to get the
[28:03] material to build it so you're not
[28:09] thinking about a third dimension you're
[28:11] talking about this well as over here and
[28:13] maybe live the hires of there you ever
[28:17] thought about this whole universe is one
[28:22] mass and it could be called one heaven
[28:32] one place
[28:39] what about God dwelling in a certain
[28:43] place is your God real enough to be able
[28:51] to live in a dimensional situation
[28:52] whatever you want call it and be so real
[28:56] until they could have been a world just
[29:03] like this world and could still be a
[29:05] world just like this world there applies
[29:08] to all of these heavens and I am NOT
[29:13] talking about an extraterrestrial beings
[29:18] or whatever you call it I don't believe
[29:20] in you you don't believe it some people
[29:27] if not the only planet no and I'll sell
[29:30] it like this to show you why I don't if
[29:33] there is anybody on Mars and living
[29:36] there they need a savior we need to get
[29:38] to Mars to tell them about Jesus Christ
[29:43] not going to try to go live come on
[29:49] folks you're going to figure out one big
[29:51] day what I've taught you for 50 years
[29:53] right here is the center of the universe
[29:56] Bible says it where there's your home's
[30:02] coming down upon this earth am i right
[30:07] so here's the center of the universe now
[30:10] we're just looks back this is where God
[30:13] lived this is where he's condescended
[30:16] down to what could it be could it be
[30:24] before anything ever existed in this
[30:27] dimensional forms that we look at out of
[30:29] this universe anything that could be a a
[30:34] place that he was living and that he was
[30:39] real per thought he's just it's just
[30:43] nothing and then it start with like
[30:47] brother branham said you say well you
[30:51] got a Polliwog bird into Polliwog come
[30:56] from right when we evolved from this
[31:03] word did the Polliwog come from remember
[31:15] what he said about it true he said - you
[31:17] better believe in that and said you
[31:18] better believe in a male and a female
[31:19] he said because they had to reproduce to
[31:21] make another Paliwal that's just putting
[31:24] it my language ok he said what are you
[31:27] talking about I'm talking about a real
[31:28] God I wish I had the education the
[31:34] terminology is the things to do to
[31:37] express it but what about the self
[31:40] existing God we existed totally alone
[31:50] you're going to strike it one of these
[31:52] days and you're going to find out
[31:53] something you're going to find out when
[31:58] the morning stars sang together the sons
[32:00] of God shouted for joy was before back
[32:07] when he was self existent
[32:15] they might have been something going on
[32:17] in the third heaven if you want to call
[32:20] it that whatever terms you want to use
[32:22] they might have been something going on
[32:24] before all of this started here you
[32:27] might find out when these days this is
[32:29] just a natural part of it remember
[32:34] you've got to have a negative make a
[32:35] picture not just have a negative
[32:43] yourself existing one who existed alone
[32:46] when there was nothing
[32:54] but by being able to let's say I wish I
[32:57] could find that those jobs got it I'll
[33:00] try to get it one day
[33:02] where these people is arguing over how
[33:05] real is God he is and the man done a
[33:06] good job because his point was they
[33:12] don't need talking about God being real
[33:17] there's no argument there there's no
[33:23] argument about God being real he said
[33:30] how can you prove it I'm looking at it
[33:33] are you real
[33:38] and there's no arguing about whether he
[33:40] was real or not because he had two
[33:42] creators so out goes that idea but now
[33:49] think about it the self existing one
[33:56] dwelt alone the Prophet said with his
[34:02] attributes brother Dale I didn't believe
[34:09] you believe in pre existence I believe
[34:12] in pre existence of eternal life I've
[34:14] always thought it that away I certainly
[34:16] flatly believe in the pre existence of
[34:18] eternal God I just don't believe in pre
[34:21] existence of mankind as we know mankind
[34:28] as we know mankind or even pre existence
[34:32] I don't believe it was something I find
[34:33] us running around as little identities
[34:35] running around up in heaven somewhere
[34:42] not believing in God existed alone he
[34:48] was somewhere why can't you believe he
[34:50] was at a place a real come on see I'm
[34:58] trying to anchor it to where your your
[35:00] human mind can't argue the point
[35:05] if there is a third dimension and there
[35:08] was something there it could not be told
[35:09] us then that's greater than where we are
[35:11] now you agree but if that was where God
[35:18] was
[35:25] here just just eat I just cringe where
[35:29] the day of course y'all know why you
[35:31] cringe because that old Catholic Baptist
[35:34] Methodist prosper Protestantism whatever
[35:37] isms and random ezrin's you know what I
[35:41] mean by that don't you I mean all the
[35:44] man's ideas he's always had God at
[35:46] something the way all thought you under
[35:48] they don't want him down here they don't
[35:52] want to think about a God that knows
[35:53] ever moved you make ever thought I was
[35:57] looking at him today
[35:58] Loretta Brennan said he knows ever
[36:01] thought it's you ever had now let me go
[36:05] one more step because I don't think he's
[36:07] arguing he knows the thoughtful you
[36:09] think yeah about that
[36:11] see that's the way my god gets griller
[36:14] my God gets greater whatever I try to
[36:17] limit into a space when I look at him he
[36:20] just gets greater geez goes out of that
[36:23] space you know we need to know this
[36:29] simple thing we need to know about
[36:31] salvation how can you be saved if you
[36:34] don't know what God is how can you be
[36:37] saved if you don't know God is real how
[36:39] can you be saved if you don't know the
[36:41] name of God cause according to my Bible
[36:43] there's only one nine given whereby man
[36:45] must be safe and that's Jesus if you
[36:51] think that is confusing the children
[36:54] sitting here understanding better what
[36:56] I'm saying to them and them - sleep and
[36:58] looking at books and drawing and
[36:59] everything else go talk to them
[37:01] sometimes and see what they got to say
[37:03] about you might want to listen to
[37:07] they might could tell you something
[37:14] now let's go on the end of this talk
[37:16] then now remember until I bring it down
[37:21] and say we have moved down into time or
[37:24] anything like that don't get your mind
[37:28] into anything dire just stay with me but
[37:34] I know we got another message at least
[37:36] we don't have to stay back in the
[37:39] beginning before the eternal to
[37:44] comprehend eternity to comprehend that
[37:49] God is real and to see him as a real
[37:56] person but random I know what he says
[38:04] and gets confusing to the mind he talks
[38:07] about the new birth and he said it's a
[38:09] person of Jesus Christ who comes and
[38:11] lives in you were then we're then he's
[38:16] in your soul by the new bar
[38:19] the very person the very being of
[38:22] Almighty God is living in you yeah but
[38:25] he was running the world
[38:26] oh that's nice I don't do that for the
[38:32] kids I do it with old age the old heads
[38:35] are things they knew all of us going
[38:36] home after 50 years you're still
[38:39] wondering about I'm talking to the
[38:40] Internet's never you're still wanders
[38:42] what's the matter with it
[38:43] God gave us 50 years after taking the
[38:46] profit off this thing for what reason
[38:50] where we could all get old enough to die
[38:54] just to clear your head oh is this
[38:56] little bit that's how we believe it I
[39:02] thought Abraham was 100 when he got his
[39:06] change so you know what there's a plea
[39:09] to just closer to changing Leon all
[39:13] right listen do you believe that God is
[39:19] a person
[39:24] do you believe in to be a person then
[39:28] how real is it like I said are we afraid
[39:38] with the president some God coming when
[39:42] I'm human
[39:43] I try to talk him in and try to be human
[39:45] cuz it's what we are
[39:47] I've heard people say you know that
[39:50] brother branham was given an altar
[39:51] calling like I said they didn't want to
[39:53] go to people so I wasn't want to go up
[39:55] in front of him what you got something
[40:02] you afraid would be brought out in the
[40:04] open it is that right if not why
[40:09] wouldn't you understand English
[40:10] president won't call his name but a
[40:14] manager in Atlanta Georgia one not
[40:15] preaching and he was bringing out that
[40:18] God was just revealing everything dire
[40:21] that he knew the people and whatever
[40:24] thing is you know what I said in the
[40:26] service is over I shook his hand I said
[40:28] in Georgia message I said but don't you
[40:31] ever be afraid to tell me what God says
[40:33] I am senator st. I said don't you ever
[40:40] be afraid to tell me I see because I
[40:42] want to know I know I make statements
[40:46] and feel it before I said I'd never
[40:49] worry about a thought that I ever had
[40:52] for my wife to know all of them Thomas I
[40:57] don't want my wife know every one of my
[41:00] talks well you got dirty thoughts
[41:02] when you want her to know him well I
[41:06] thought about it this morning I thought
[41:08] you were in here seeking went down what
[41:13] is the state when I make after then as
[41:16] long as she hears the life stop and I
[41:20] have I made that wrong about her you
[41:28] tell me I never thought wrong about my
[41:30] wife
[41:30] you just a liar that's just blunt as can
[41:34] be wife or husband don't tell me
[41:36] joke I just call you a liar cause you're
[41:42] healing ain't you if you tell me you
[41:44] ain't never had no thoughts I won't tell
[41:45] you we're good cause you ain't human
[41:48] but you get the point
[41:50] I don't mind my wife knowing anything
[41:52] about myself as long as he hears the
[41:55] livestock stop running how much I love
[41:58] her and what I cherish her honor her why
[42:05] wouldn't you want God to know your
[42:08] thoughts you know the reason I want him
[42:12] to know my thoughts where I can repent
[42:15] of them and get rid of it is that not
[42:18] right would you not want a clean slate
[42:21] between you and the Lord are you afraid
[42:23] of the personality of God are you afraid
[42:26] now listen come on hey I'm human I'm
[42:28] human
[42:29] these brothers said I Tara brother
[42:31] branham and him telling all of their
[42:32] thoughts and I'm here what I tell her
[42:35] said Lord wife it's like clean for he
[42:38] gets to me but it wouldn't bother me a
[42:41] bit
[42:41] for him to say or anybody to say the
[42:44] deal you thought so-and-so a while ago
[42:46] that's right I said did you hear the
[42:52] lifestyle I had the last thing I tell my
[42:59] Lord and Savior because I love you I
[43:05] love you
[43:10] I won't even know that the prairie green
[43:13] told it one time said bread around told
[43:15] him said brother Perry he said if you
[43:17] ever feel the president's the Lord close
[43:19] to you he said tell him I love him he
[43:23] wanted God to know he loved him don't
[43:27] you well why would you be afraid of a
[43:30] person or something real I mean you're
[43:38] afraid to come to church that I might
[43:40] call out your sin or somebody else might
[43:48] come in and cultures are you afraid of
[43:50] that why do you not want your sins under
[43:55] the blood maybe you like it I listen to
[44:04] run around him one day and I heard him
[44:05] to make this statement about that man
[44:07] that fell over him every demon and I'll
[44:10] break it fell over his feet you remember
[44:15] the life to that story
[44:20] Goethe Branham said he didn't want to
[44:22] get rid of that spirit he loved it study
[44:25] your message you'll find out he said he
[44:29] didn't want to get rid of that spirit he
[44:32] said that spirit never went off at him
[44:34] he just went under control maybe you
[44:42] love that person you are and going to be
[44:45] in the presence of a living God ain't
[44:52] going to get through now eaglehorn back
[44:54] I try but I hope you're listening to an
[45:01] honest person talking from an honest
[45:03] heart to you and to believing that God
[45:09] is real
[45:14] and there's more real than all your
[45:15] thoughts that you could ever have
[45:22] but you were to think about envision
[45:24] like that you sure want him on the scene
[45:27] when a racks taking blood right
[45:29] you own him on the scene when you're
[45:31] lost in the woods you want him on the
[45:33] scene when things are going wrong and
[45:34] you're hurting right but you only don't
[45:37] want even harder to get rid of something
[45:46] there whether you sell or don't don't
[45:48] come too far into my houses come inside
[45:51] the door I'm quoting read around them
[45:53] doors and doors if we say come in so far
[45:56] but don't you come in the rest of my
[45:57] home we blend it with how real is a
[46:06] person we spend a lot of time
[46:09] emphasizing to prove that the name of
[46:14] the Lord Jesus Christ is correct for the
[46:16] water baptism and what is our emphasis
[46:20] upon that then we don't believe in three
[46:25] persons Blessed Trinity because the
[46:33] person the personality personality is an
[46:35] individual individual is a person so if
[46:37] you got a person you're coming back to
[46:38] one we don't believe in the Trinitarian
[46:43] concept because at least we can see that
[46:48] much that he's a person is how real is
[46:56] he
[46:59] let's pick up a few quotes and read them
[47:02] and go as far as we can go would take up
[47:05] chandi couple minor rapture takes place
[47:08] we'll finish this an eternity don't
[47:11] we'll see you Sunday some of you a lot
[47:14] of going on I totally wanted the other
[47:17] day when it won't come on that I'm going
[47:19] to be going this right I'm gonna be
[47:20] going that way only but I look around I
[47:22] said maybe we need to just shut down and
[47:24] go with it
[47:28] no problem let's go to a number let's go
[47:40] to number three brothers to start from
[47:42] there how real is your God then watching
[47:53] no don't let it get to this is from the
[47:56] message the dedication in building a
[47:59] dedicating built of building to the Lord
[48:03] it's a path well I believe in a measure
[48:06] and listen to it that God is omnipresent
[48:09] in other words I think we about him
[48:11] being on the present God is omnipresent
[48:17] him being omniscient makes him
[48:22] omnipresent omniscient means you know
[48:25] all things
[48:25] I'm the present means you're personally
[48:28] present in all things you understand
[48:31] what I'm getting it
[48:32] omnipresent means that you're present
[48:35] everywhere is that I'm the present means
[48:41] your president so if God is just a
[48:42] floating spirit he can be everywhere no
[48:48] what is he saying God is omnipresent him
[48:52] being omniscient which means he knows
[48:54] everything makes him omnipresent now I
[48:58] defined that like this as far as I know
[49:00] there's no spaceships going to the moon
[49:02] right now you know so there's a couple
[49:06] of guys up there all that God's dealing
[49:08] with in couple of geysers up there
[49:10] I don't know how many is up there
[49:11] whatever did
[49:13] none of my business I'm just making a
[49:14] point you don't have to be on Mars
[49:16] because everybody on Mars we understand
[49:21] when he's omniscient means he knows to
[49:24] be wherever he needs to be good listen
[49:28] and watch it being omniscient makes him
[49:31] under pressure if God is omnipresent
[49:35] just like the atmosphere then he's a
[49:41] myth that's pretty strong talking in the
[49:50] most the illusions that learn you don't
[49:52] understand his Bible he said but I know
[49:54] the God of the Bible
[49:57] listen if God is omnipresent just like
[50:02] the atmosphere then he's a myth
[50:07] see the reason just ever were floating
[50:10] he's not that away what the God is a
[50:13] person therefore he has to have a
[50:18] certain place that he dwells and he's
[50:25] omnipresent by being omniscient
[50:28] therefore if he is everywhere because
[50:32] being omniscient and he knows everything
[50:34] therefore he knows everything he knows
[50:37] what's going on at every place but God
[50:41] Himself dwells in a certain place there
[50:48] for him being infinite and a word
[50:52] infinite cannot be broken down into any
[50:55] word by any language I love that you
[51:02] can't define infinite that's what he's
[51:04] saying in no language can you define
[51:07] infinite watching the red for the is
[51:13] infinities I guess we pronounce that
[51:15] it's from our own and God is infinite
[51:22] now watching and if I would try to make
[51:26] one quote
[51:27] tation what infinate means now watching
[51:31] your profit is going to try to define
[51:34] something and he said no language can
[51:37] define are you listening when they say
[51:43] we will figure out he was a prophet if I
[51:48] would try to make one quotation what
[51:51] infinite means that would be that a
[51:54] hundred million years before the world
[51:58] was ever formed the infant God knew ever
[52:02] FLE that would ever be on the earth and
[52:06] old ever time he bad his eye each to
[52:11] them that doesn't even start high of
[52:19] what it means to be infinite he said
[52:26] therefore God being infinite and
[52:28] omniscient now he believes God being
[52:31] infinite right he tried to define
[52:33] infinite there's no way to define
[52:34] infinite but he believes God is infinite
[52:37] therefore God being infinite and
[52:39] omniscient he knows all things
[52:41] he knows everything that's going on at
[52:43] all places at all times but he himself
[52:46] is a person dwelling in one place
[52:52] therefore he could we could call him
[52:56] omniscient now he's a person how real
[53:05] then is a person
[53:13] go ahead let's see yeah we read then
[53:16] let's read this one called we read it
[53:18] last week we'll go to number three a
[53:20] which is second Corinthians 12 into I
[53:23] knew a man in Christ above fourteen
[53:25] years ago within the body I cannot tell
[53:29] see to understand what was taken blood
[53:31] but around him when he goes beyond the
[53:32] curtain of time he said basically the
[53:34] same time he said I was in body or out
[53:36] of body of water
[53:37] go wait how can you define it you laying
[53:41] here need up here whether in body I
[53:46] cannot tell or whether out a body I
[53:47] cannot tell God knoweth such in one
[53:50] caught up to the third heaven and saw
[53:54] things remember the rest of screws you
[53:59] and you couldn't even speak up so in the
[54:04] third heaven God is real
[54:13] you think's up there in the third heaven
[54:20] well I don't see it you don't want to
[54:24] see it because you're afraid of it I'm
[54:30] sorry
[54:32] maybe that's the Lord or maybe it's me
[54:34] either one of them is right why would
[54:38] you want to be afraid of God I know
[54:42] there's a supernatural part about it for
[54:44] folks I've experienced I don't have to
[54:46] worry about it I've told you over the
[54:47] years what God's done and said and
[54:49] things like that I don't have to worry
[54:51] about it I know he's real and I know the
[54:53] feeling and I know the thing and I know
[54:55] the human elements of us is fear that's
[54:58] why he always in the Bible when he would
[55:00] come to man what'd he say you know we're
[55:04] understood after all of the thousands of
[55:07] times did he come in the presence of
[55:09] that being he said it still makes you
[55:11] afraid but I said don't get into that
[55:15] you know we're not afraid ain't talking
[55:17] about not being afraid ain't talking
[55:19] about unsensible think I'm dumb at
[55:21] sensible why wouldn't you want God close
[55:27] to you
[55:33] you're trying to hide your life you've
[55:39] never got to the place of what I'm
[55:40] saying
[55:41] my emphases were talking about my wife I
[55:44] don't care if she here in my life stop I
[55:46] don't care what God would bring up
[55:49] before me if he just remembers at the
[55:51] end of it
[55:52] I said Father forgive me that's the
[55:58] thing I want him to remember that you
[56:02] that's how really is to me when you get
[56:09] in something happening in your life is
[56:12] quick to be snapped away from you
[56:13] whatever you ain't got time brother
[56:15] browning said to pray you ain't got time
[56:20] to pray it out you ain't got time to try
[56:22] to figure out whether you've got any sin
[56:24] that needs to be done you better start
[56:26] speaking the word you better start
[56:32] believing but what about him do you
[56:39] believe he's a person that dwells in a
[56:41] place I'm going to read you one over
[56:44] here in this a minute okay they can pull
[56:47] it young - go ahead brother Joe and pull
[56:49] number seven he's taking the things that
[56:54] are to be now remember what we're saying
[56:55] over here God dwells in a place where is
[56:59] he dwelled Paul talking with third
[57:02] heaven where is he'd well he's on knit
[57:06] I'm the president because he's
[57:08] omniscient omniscient because he's on
[57:09] the pressure therefore by his
[57:11] foreknowledge now he can't be just like
[57:14] the wind over the earth because he's a
[57:17] being he just isn't a myth remember what
[57:23] we're going to go if it's just out of
[57:25] this floating around it's a myth you got
[57:29] to find that person it's just hidden the
[57:31] myth
[57:32] he's a being and he dwells even dwells
[57:35] in a house he dwells in a place called
[57:38] heaven
[57:46] all said he went to the third heaven why
[57:52] does the Bible say that when Jesus
[57:54] resurrected and he's young the one that
[57:59] reached immortality and that's Bible you
[58:08] say all you want to he said with him Old
[58:11] Testament Saints when they went up with
[58:13] Jesus how far did it go to what heaven
[58:16] did they go and stop now quote right
[58:23] around him when he went beyond the
[58:25] curtain of time he said I want to see
[58:27] Jesus he said you can't see him why he
[58:32] says he's up a higher another heaven
[58:42] just one I'm differed with the brothers
[58:44] about the Old Testament Saints in the
[58:46] way they're doing that's all hind forget
[58:50] all that that's just just talk about him
[58:52] being real and see how really really is
[58:58] even dwells in the place a house he
[59:01] dwells in a place called heaven
[59:03] yeah but brother Dale I kept my eye he
[59:06] said what's the future home is it not
[59:12] true in the future home that he's going
[59:14] to build before us is that not true
[59:17] you agree with that but here's your home
[59:20] we don't have anything to do with
[59:21] building it right is that right because
[59:24] he's done gone to build it hey he went
[59:27] up come right back down in here where's
[59:28] you working from right here but forget
[59:29] that going with the rest of it he says
[59:34] there's a river running true he says his
[59:39] byways and his way he says his houses
[59:42] he said if you get there and said you
[59:45] her old bread around him down by the
[59:46] river in a little old log cabin did you
[59:53] hear him sing hymns and what do you say
[59:54] blower he made it
[59:58] if the future home is real which one of
[1:00:04] the heavens is at and you say well it's
[1:00:11] the third or you can say it's the second
[1:00:14] he say what's going to that all right
[1:00:15] I'm just trying to get a point God
[1:00:19] doesn't just float in the air the Bible
[1:00:30] City walks in the fiery places the Bible
[1:00:35] said he travels throughout the land and
[1:00:39] in depth and it hide my Bible said he
[1:00:43] was in the fiery furnace the three
[1:00:45] Hebrew children he walks in those places
[1:00:49] he's real he's your God real or is he
[1:00:57] just a thought but I didn't I never
[1:00:59] thought it was required of anything he
[1:01:02] can drop back now we'll pick up go to
[1:01:11] number four let's pick up read a little
[1:01:14] bit and look like I know I won't get
[1:01:16] through I'm glad Adela get through it
[1:01:22] wasn't so from the beginning that God is
[1:01:24] omnipotent which means he knows all time
[1:01:27] right God is omnipresent which it means
[1:01:30] he can be everywhere he wants to by
[1:01:32] being omniscient makes him on the
[1:01:36] president and he knows all things
[1:01:38] because God could not be just like the
[1:01:41] air is because God has a dwelling place
[1:01:45] God is not a myth
[1:01:47] God is a being God Jesus he God pronoun
[1:01:54] he's a being therefore he's omniscient
[1:01:57] he's omnipresent he's omnipotent in His
[1:02:00] infinite and to be infinite it comes
[1:02:03] through a word infinite which there is
[1:02:05] no limit his eternal eternal is like a
[1:02:09] ring it goes
[1:02:10] and around and you're trying to find
[1:02:12] where it began to where it ends there is
[1:02:14] no beginning or ending to it
[1:02:16] he's a beating he's a beating
[1:02:22] go ahead number five adoption 1960 but
[1:02:31] being infinite then he knows all things
[1:02:33] knowing every time an at-bat since I
[1:02:36] know whatever bumblebee where he goes
[1:02:39] into the comb to get his honey he knows
[1:02:42] every Sparrow that sits in the tree he
[1:02:45] knows every thoughts ever thought that's
[1:02:51] in your mind and like I said I believe
[1:02:56] he knows it for you everything you know
[1:03:00] now that day I said I'll bet they look
[1:03:02] down too much a lot if you didn't know
[1:03:10] your thoughts who you think them then
[1:03:12] who is he we can pull things over on him
[1:03:16] every once in a while you know why they
[1:03:18] won't for Trinitarian concept go
[1:03:22] somewhere between Father Son and Holy
[1:03:23] Ghost maybe my life gets lost
[1:03:28] we want the Father to intercede with
[1:03:30] this and this an energy for that and
[1:03:32] well if it's over yes then with all that
[1:03:33] which we grab Mary and put her in the
[1:03:35] middle just in case we need a little
[1:03:36] more and once they do it now brother
[1:03:39] branham and put him down come on they
[1:03:45] believe he was God they was praying to
[1:03:46] it they were baptizing in his name or
[1:03:51] this reckon they are now he knows every
[1:03:58] thought they send your mind because he's
[1:04:00] infant enough that is he not only is he
[1:04:04] infinite
[1:04:05] he's omniscient he knows everything but
[1:04:08] he's a beating
[1:04:09] God is a being and out of this being
[1:04:12] begin to form bring forth these a being
[1:04:17] a person Oh ed number six we read that
[1:04:22] one that
[1:04:23] which one we were at you know number
[1:04:25] whoever number six and he's talking
[1:04:32] he said and God is a being God's not
[1:04:35] like you're like the air if he would
[1:04:38] this is why I love the Prophet he don't
[1:04:41] leave you no grounds to stand on I feel
[1:04:45] a little just Center oh I got him
[1:04:47] because he didn't quote this word and
[1:04:49] he's off over here and his power this is
[1:04:52] not according to that the land says that
[1:04:57] if he's a educated sensible man he's got
[1:05:02] enough sense to know I said that right
[1:05:06] if he's got any sense at all
[1:05:08] he knows the man knows what he's talking
[1:05:12] about
[1:05:15] brother Moke said what do you believe on
[1:05:17] one god I said God in three persons
[1:05:20] he said that's as much Trinitarian as
[1:05:23] anything else I said explain yourself
[1:05:25] brother he said cause a person of the
[1:05:26] personality personality the individual
[1:05:28] individual persons you got three God
[1:05:30] just like the rest I didn't get mad I
[1:05:34] didn't get to say nothing I looked at
[1:05:36] him when I said I don't believe that
[1:05:37] anymore
[1:05:39] why because I had enough sense to know
[1:05:42] the man had me our common words are
[1:05:44] saying nailed to the wall that I
[1:05:46] couldn't move oh I could have argued
[1:05:50] with him that God helps God not like
[1:05:55] you're like the air if he would you
[1:05:59] would never have to seek the Holy Ghost
[1:06:02] it would be in you because he filled all
[1:06:07] faiths and things God's omnipresent sure
[1:06:11] I'll be an omniscient no nothing but God
[1:06:14] has a dwelling place because he is a
[1:06:15] being exactly right and God dwells with
[1:06:18] social under the shed blood of his son
[1:06:20] in that alone not in your denominations
[1:06:24] we don't read the other one let's read
[1:06:26] it again number seven things that are to
[1:06:31] be he's omnipresent because he's
[1:06:35] omniscient omniscient because he's on
[1:06:37] president therefore by his foreknowledge
[1:06:39] now he can't be just like the wind over
[1:06:42] the earth because he is a being he just
[1:06:45] isn't a myth
[1:06:45] he's a being he dwells even dwells in
[1:06:49] the house he dwells in a place called
[1:06:51] heaven and therefore by he is omniscient
[1:06:54] being omnipresent being omniscient
[1:06:57] I'm nothing being unpleasant I miss
[1:07:01] knowing all things then he's omnipresent
[1:07:03] because he knows all the things let me
[1:07:14] continue at least a second talk how real
[1:07:21] your God is and remember the point that
[1:07:25] I'm saying is it by way of God sending a
[1:07:29] messenger to us in the last days do we
[1:07:32] understand these times we can understand
[1:07:37] that he was real we can understand he
[1:07:39] was a place that he dwells we can
[1:07:42] understand this even in heaven we can
[1:07:44] understand that he's not like the wind
[1:07:46] we can understand it he's not a me up
[1:07:48] there a thought of our mind we can
[1:07:50] understand all those signs one because
[1:07:52] God has delivered to us a prophet fifty
[1:07:55] years were eNOS fifty years I've been
[1:08:02] screaming and hollering this to the
[1:08:04] people that would listen why has
[1:08:07] everybody else run out of something to
[1:08:09] preach and then they start on all this
[1:08:11] junk stuff and they get on to it right
[1:08:17] now I'm just getting started
[1:08:22] what about knowing that your God is real
[1:08:26] no I need to being knowing he dwells in
[1:08:31] a place knowing that he was in a place
[1:08:33] before any other place ever come into
[1:08:36] existence or do you think he was just
[1:08:39] floating through there
[1:08:40] when I guess you're saying just I don't
[1:08:42] know what to do I do
[1:08:49] they said the other day even the
[1:08:53] thinker's got better Simpson had like
[1:08:56] weight said spend II think are setting
[1:08:59] their you wondering worse closer to
[1:09:02] heaven yeah
[1:09:04] at least he's thinking people in this
[1:09:08] message over the way they say we don't
[1:09:10] want them we don't want to know them
[1:09:12] deep time we get confused do we know
[1:09:15] them see ocean and seventy weeks of
[1:09:17] Daniel and all them like we get all
[1:09:19] confused honey don't worry about it
[1:09:26] there's more than confused much more
[1:09:31] confusion got to do it I'm trying to get
[1:09:35] rid of confusion to talk to you about a
[1:09:38] real God and how did we talk about it
[1:09:46] what about illiterate people and I mean
[1:09:53] that was all love and respect educated
[1:09:56] people in this message but human beings
[1:10:02] that we can't think about God being real
[1:10:04] yet we think we're real we can't think
[1:10:08] about a heaven and a heavenly place we
[1:10:11] had exists all around us we can't think
[1:10:18] about his name you remember when you was
[1:10:22] in the Baptist Methodist Presbyterian
[1:10:23] Catholics and cetera and so I'd ask you
[1:10:26] what's his name you said Jesus and folks
[1:10:29] come on I'm sorry we know no more about
[1:10:33] God at that time than a Hottentot in
[1:10:35] Africa knows about an Egyptian not if
[1:10:38] you know your story there ain't no
[1:10:40] Egyptian not so you get that one
[1:10:48] yet we say his name is Jesus I tried my
[1:10:57] best explaining it wasn't Jes us that
[1:11:01] was lost in the ages they still called
[1:11:06] in Jesus the Catholics still call him
[1:11:09] Jesus everybody calls in Jesus but who
[1:11:12] do they believe he is the second person
[1:11:15] of the Trinity now you got two persons
[1:11:19] then you got two persons you got two god
[1:11:22] which one's the greatest come on I know
[1:11:26] their doctrine God in three persons
[1:11:29] Blessed Trinity co-equal and coeternal
[1:11:35] now how can you have a son go evil with
[1:11:38] the father when the son has a beginning
[1:11:43] but we said we already know the name of
[1:11:45] Jesus would it have to be restored down
[1:11:49] in ages or do we define the Bible let
[1:11:54] alone the Prophet to say it didn't need
[1:11:56] to be restored what they need to be
[1:12:00] restored who Jesus is not how to
[1:12:05] pronounce it what's his name
[1:12:18] but a Brenham says everything is named
[1:12:23] Jesus where it's the only name that God
[1:12:28] ever had it's the message of doctrine
[1:12:32] the only name God everything that we
[1:12:38] want to find some new nothing we will
[1:12:39] find something
[1:12:40] let's run out this name first I only
[1:12:47] asked this one simple question for 50
[1:12:49] years what if it's not another name that
[1:12:52] we're looking for but a deeper
[1:12:55] revelation of the name of Jesus that's
[1:13:00] all I've ever asked well you got to
[1:13:04] remember one time the father is still in
[1:13:11] glory he may be the third heaven we
[1:13:23] haven't learned anything about him Co
[1:13:24] we're learning about the son then what
[1:13:29] did the Sun Shine I didn't come to speak
[1:13:32] about myself I come to tell you about my
[1:13:34] father will flicker one of these days
[1:13:38] the scripture is right when it says no
[1:13:40] man has seen the father
[1:13:41] I don't believe when we get up to heaven
[1:13:45] there's gonna be a little place over
[1:13:46] here for the father
[1:13:47] little place here for the son a little
[1:13:49] place over here for the Holy Ghost do
[1:13:50] you know I believe we're going to see
[1:13:52] Jesus and nobody is so will not run out
[1:14:00] this name first God's name is Jesus
[1:14:06] Christ I wish you could look at the
[1:14:07] stack let on my dash for that it just
[1:14:10] makes that statement what a neat
[1:14:12] computer run Jesus Christ emergency how
[1:14:14] many times wrote around said Jesus
[1:14:15] Christ remember Jesus the flesh man
[1:14:19] never created all things Jesus the
[1:14:21] Christ is the creator of all things the
[1:14:24] flesh man never created anything
[1:14:29] about it and his name is Jesus there's
[1:14:35] no name under heaven whereby men must be
[1:14:37] saved in the name of Jesus Christ what
[1:14:48] about it do you believe that there was a
[1:14:55] self-existing God that existed along the
[1:14:58] Eddy was a being you believe that and
[1:15:03] that being his name is Jesus and he
[1:15:07] stood here on earth and said if you sing
[1:15:10] me Philip he said you seen the father
[1:15:15] he said because I my father won you know
[1:15:21] what I love about the way the word is
[1:15:22] written new because when he come over to
[1:15:26] the ascension he raised up and Marie
[1:15:32] talked to everyone decided he said don't
[1:15:35] touch me I'm not yet ascended the what'd
[1:15:39] he say I go to my father and your father
[1:15:47] I go to my god and your God that's why
[1:15:55] we're missed Jesus right now and if
[1:15:58] there's a name change whatever it'll be
[1:16:00] we don't worry about it go will be
[1:16:01] missed whatever it is think about it now
[1:16:10] let's take this for a minute give me
[1:16:12] give me a little bit for nought and look
[1:16:14] you don't you think you could see she
[1:16:19] see God no man has seen God at any time
[1:16:25] that's probable then all of it says the
[1:16:29] only begotten has declared him brought
[1:16:33] him out in the open in other words
[1:16:35] showed what he looked like
[1:16:37] now what does your God look like
[1:16:42] well if he's just a floating blob out
[1:16:44] there he's just a floating blob is he's
[1:16:50] an elephant he's an elephant why does he
[1:16:56] look like there was a day when you said
[1:17:02] that the people and they just about run
[1:17:03] you out of the building right to think
[1:17:05] about somebody to say they'd seen God
[1:17:07] and emphatically stating it okay so I
[1:17:12] don't forget this I want this statement
[1:17:14] laid right here let her brand him I
[1:17:16] quoted it somebody the other day little
[1:17:18] ol brother branham said when that
[1:17:21] picture of the halo that's over his head
[1:17:27] is hanging in Washington DC
[1:17:32] he said for you to see that picture is
[1:17:42] more real and if you were standing there
[1:17:46] looking at he said because the cameras I
[1:17:51] won't catch psychology right
[1:18:02] are you getting a little second for you
[1:18:05] to pick up that picture that you've
[1:18:06] carry well no and see right around his
[1:18:10] picture with a halo part for you to see
[1:18:17] that and hold that picture is more real
[1:18:19] than it would be if you were standing
[1:18:22] there that day because if we were
[1:18:25] standing there that day something
[1:18:26] supernatural could take place and
[1:18:28] deceive you but that camera don't take
[1:18:29] supernatural in the right now I say one
[1:18:36] more then I'll pull up another for you
[1:18:40] to see that hail that lot at an Arizona
[1:18:49] that made the picture of the head of
[1:18:51] Christ you see that of a camera laid by
[1:18:56] a camera is more real than if you'd have
[1:18:59] been standing right there when it went
[1:19:01] up why because Satan could impersonate
[1:19:07] when a camera takes a picture it has to
[1:19:11] have something to strike the negative so
[1:19:14] don't forget that dog it will be
[1:19:18] valuable in just a minute or two you can
[1:19:22] see how real God really is he said well
[1:19:29] we've never seen this or never seen that
[1:19:32] have you ever seen Jesus read that not
[1:19:36] in a picture not a star not innovation
[1:19:38] no have you the visionaries I'd really
[1:19:42] think you seen Jesus but now what if
[1:19:48] your prophet said that Hoffman's picture
[1:19:53] was the closest to the way Jesus looked
[1:19:55] and your Jesus looked like some hideous
[1:20:00] you know I'm going to say you didn't see
[1:20:05] that by the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit
[1:20:09] I'm going to show one person a vision of
[1:20:11] Jesus and him being an old man or old
[1:20:15] their sir warped up
[1:20:16] twisted rubber and said you were to go
[1:20:18] to the Vatican and see what you got
[1:20:19] hanging that they say that's what Jesus
[1:20:22] looks like you need those clothes what
[1:20:27] about your prophet all of you or to know
[1:20:33] these things go to number 12 brothers in
[1:20:36] this hurry the message called faith 1953
[1:20:44] he's talking about brother Bosworth and
[1:20:48] all of the things and there's burning in
[1:20:51] my heart knowing that something God had
[1:20:52] promised on the opening of the power and
[1:20:56] I'm waiting now for him which I believe
[1:21:00] will appear to me visible I set with
[1:21:08] reverence
[1:21:10] I'm seen in class 53 of course it was a
[1:21:19] vision and remember that remember what
[1:21:27] he seen with a vision he was standing in
[1:21:34] the IRA
[1:21:35] one night I stood you remember about his
[1:21:37] daddy in the time even broken extraord
[1:21:40] putting this is a mouth and shoot it
[1:21:42] looked again surely this is not a vision
[1:21:44] but surely this is not vision I stood
[1:21:47] during the broom stage you're looking
[1:21:48] I've been praying all night and I looked
[1:21:52] again and I seen him with his foot like
[1:21:53] that and his hands folded looking
[1:21:57] towards the east and I walked around
[1:22:00] this way and cleared my throat and when
[1:22:04] he looked around and when he looked
[1:22:07] around at me raised up his arm I fainted
[1:22:11] and didn't come to till the next morning
[1:22:13] I have an idea what he looks like
[1:22:20] and I've been feeling for the last few
[1:22:23] months that I'll see him again here
[1:22:26] pretty soon that he'll reveal again his
[1:22:30] something that's fixing to come I
[1:22:32] remember what I asked you to remember
[1:22:33] what I go if I remember that ask you
[1:22:36] remember something about Abraham what
[1:22:39] was it asking you to say about a brown
[1:22:41] Abraham seeing God in visions and we
[1:22:43] haven't seen God in drink and it was
[1:22:45] just kept seeing God within one day he
[1:22:48] seen melchester dick Moses his weight
[1:22:54] was bringing up seeing him here standing
[1:22:56] here seen him with a burning bush then
[1:22:58] one day he told him and said I want to
[1:23:00] see you he's go standing in the rock and
[1:23:03] we walked by he saw the back part of a
[1:23:05] man but I said that was Jesus you think
[1:23:13] it was an old man appeared them up to
[1:23:14] Abraham we think the old man it appeared
[1:23:21] to Moses if we're gonna stay on that in
[1:23:29] the vision this rumor one time they're
[1:23:31] gonna lean on my desk we'd like to see
[1:23:32] him you know Brett around sitting at the

[1:23:52] earth and take up a body to eat they say
[1:23:54] yeah but wait a minute Mel chatter dick
[1:23:56] one glad you thought man I remember
[1:24:00] Melchizedek was a human being spoke into
[1:24:03] existence and spoke right back out that
[1:24:06] was not the theophany that theophany was
[1:24:13] inside of them you know what it looked
[1:24:15] like what was outside you got any
[1:24:18] problems with that
[1:24:19] what are your theophany look like
[1:24:21] Weather Center or saying what did you
[1:24:22] see how they look like look like you you
[1:24:26] know it look like somebody else
[1:24:27] oh come on all of us got a little bit
[1:24:30] doing here
[1:24:31] we want to think about well getting over
[1:24:33] our boy we know how all this that's how
[1:24:35] silly we think remember if the orphanage
[1:24:39] don't eat the ground was still right he
[1:24:42] said no charity with Almighty
[1:24:44] well charity was a theophany inside of a
[1:24:46] human element the human element could
[1:24:50] not die for your sins he was not your
[1:24:53] brother
[1:24:53] oh yeah you look he said I've seen him
[1:25:00] twice she walked around cleared his
[1:25:05] throat you know number 13 was read faced
[1:25:17] everything yes sure and they she's the
[1:25:20] masterpiece with what auditorally
[1:25:30] sitting there he said that's right
[1:25:31] exactly where he saw Jesus the first
[1:25:33] time in vision that's built orderto and
[1:25:35] built right over the same spot I went
[1:25:37] right here the other day and look and
[1:25:39] when I looked and seeing him looking
[1:25:40] toward the east you remember hearing me
[1:25:42] tell you when I was out there preaching
[1:25:44] for praying for my father a little boy
[1:25:47] just a little boy just a boy preacher
[1:25:49] that's where I saw him step looking at
[1:25:52] him he had his head turned sideways from
[1:25:54] me I kept walking around clearing my
[1:25:57] throat in a broom Said's feeling I kept
[1:25:59] watching and he never did never did turn
[1:26:03] and I called his name Jesus and he
[1:26:05] turned around and held his arms out and
[1:26:07] that's all I remember
[1:26:09] is that the one holding there that's 13
[1:26:14] he called him Jesus he got his attention
[1:26:18] so evidently saw Jesus is right he saw
[1:26:23] Jesus evidently got it
[1:26:25] right go to the next scene not our the
[1:26:27] show wrote it up my street fight while I
[1:26:30] was praying and asking God to save him
[1:26:31] and not to let him die center that I
[1:26:34] loved him while I was in prayer I raised
[1:26:37] up to look up towards the east from here
[1:26:39] and there was a vision and standing just
[1:26:42] above me many of you know the vision was
[1:26:45] the Lord Jesus he was just above
[1:26:48] probably 10 feet above my head standing
[1:26:51] in a tower with one foot just making her
[1:26:53] step he had a white garment
[1:26:57] Lerman a friends around the side of it
[1:26:59] he had hired down to his old shoulders
[1:27:01] he looked to be a man about what the
[1:27:04] Bible said he was about thirty but a
[1:27:06] small thin built fella very small looked
[1:27:10] like wooden weighed over a hundred and
[1:27:12] thirty pounds he's been pretty good
[1:27:14] describing any because he described it
[1:27:19] he's describing Jesus come on and I
[1:27:25] looked at her thought personal that I
[1:27:28] might be wrong from I rubbed my eyes and
[1:27:30] looked up again and he was standing kind
[1:27:33] of sideways kind of a profile of his
[1:27:36] face in the looks of his face which I've
[1:27:39] always seen in the visions once he he
[1:27:44] didn't see an old man who envisioned a
[1:27:46] young man another vision is always seen
[1:27:48] in visions has been like Hoffman's
[1:27:52] head of Christ they use his $30 the
[1:27:56] others he uses 33 look that's the reason
[1:28:01] I have that in my house on my literature
[1:28:05] because that's the way it look more like
[1:28:07] that only seem to be small Hoffman so
[1:28:15] what does Jesus look like Oh
[1:28:25] well you said now not exactly okay
[1:28:29] he said it close close the only he was a
[1:28:36] small man and to get this place now
[1:28:45] there's true three more quotes about him
[1:28:48] Hoffman's with everybody agree with me
[1:28:51] whereas shorten it in a hurry then what
[1:28:53] brother branham saw standing out in the
[1:28:54] field in time was a picture close he saw
[1:28:57] Jesus and he was close to looking like
[1:29:01] Hoffman's head of Christ at 33 I know
[1:29:06] the difference between this and how all
[1:29:08] this makeover had been made I put these
[1:29:10] two pictures up here for this one to
[1:29:12] represent him at about thirty years of
[1:29:14] age and this one to representing them at
[1:29:16] 33 the reason is because I'm in the
[1:29:20] middle and I accomplished that problem
[1:29:22] he said well that don't do I don't care
[1:29:24] who job dad and what they done to get it
[1:29:26] I surprised you when they change it
[1:29:35] listen go ahead to the next one which
[1:29:39] would be spiritual food and you see then
[1:29:48] when that went up and what's he talking
[1:29:51] about
[1:29:52] Tucson Arizona seven angels right hey
[1:29:56] buddy women in the robe a career the
[1:29:58] seven angels coming to it you remember
[1:30:01] that watch I hope you'll catch this one
[1:30:04] and listen he saw a vision in
[1:30:08] jeffersonville in 62 saw the angels and
[1:30:15] saw the fame and saw all of the things
[1:30:17] he goes to Tucson did he see a vision
[1:30:26] you don't remember me walking down
[1:30:29] through that idiot he didn't see a
[1:30:34] vision in Tucson they took a picture of
[1:30:38] what he saw not realize things are right
[1:30:44] Abraham seen him singing sing then he
[1:30:46] appeared today that's all I'm trying to
[1:30:48] do that didn't make anything out of
[1:30:50] rudder breath it makes it to be heard
[1:30:53] supposed to be look Robert down in
[1:30:56] Mexico to son Edward taking the picture
[1:30:58] with it it was mysterious I George a
[1:31:01] picture or something that was real
[1:31:02] something struck the lens of the camera
[1:31:03] right I don't care what they say now
[1:31:06] that it was a jet it was short looks
[1:31:08] good it was material side brother Fred
[1:31:12] Salomon they're sitting right back there
[1:31:13] an iron brother Jean Norman standing
[1:31:16] right there president when it went up
[1:31:17] they took the picture still they don't
[1:31:20] know what about it you're some time ago
[1:31:22] even saying look at here this looks like
[1:31:24] this and the main JAL's wings how they
[1:31:28] unfolded in there now let's do something
[1:31:36] if I take a minute or two and you got to
[1:31:38] go go ahead too far clear
[1:31:42] would you pull up Hoffman's pitcher
[1:31:46] brother Joe
[1:31:47] 33 it'd take us a minute because we
[1:31:56] didn't know how this was gonna go
[1:32:06] you want to know what Jesus looks like
[1:32:07] you see the clothes as it was with
[1:32:10] Hoffman at 33 okay now this Hoffman's
[1:32:21] really is a crop off taken from the rich
[1:32:25] young ruler because Hoffman tainted rich
[1:32:27] young ruler Jesus in the Garden of
[1:32:29] Gethsemane and then we'll do his three
[1:32:32] there's three of them
[1:32:32] where he was praying in the garden and
[1:32:34] then when he was a young child with the
[1:32:37] talking to the priest and that's the
[1:32:40] three Hoffman's all right there is that
[1:32:44] one so if we can get that one brother
[1:32:45] Joe we'll just say with that one get the
[1:32:48] one with Jesus where's the rich young
[1:32:49] ruler I asked him to crop off the rich
[1:32:51] young ruler for you to get a point you
[1:32:57] know that one and what it looks like
[1:33:01] there's what he looks like he said what
[1:33:04] I just too much now well that's what
[1:33:06] your prophet said now so if you think
[1:33:08] he's too much then goodbye you ain't
[1:33:12] going no further approval no because you
[1:33:17] done blinded yourself he's the one that
[1:33:20] said that's what it looked like the
[1:33:24] closest could be with Hoffman's and
[1:33:26] there he stands with the rich young
[1:33:29] ruler over on this side come that part
[1:33:31] of his garment Hoffman's were originally
[1:33:34] is that they cropped it off in my damp
[1:33:38] they pulled it down and laid this out of
[1:33:42] it he didn't paint just this by itself
[1:33:46] he painted that and they cropped it down
[1:33:50] from there now so when he went out to
[1:33:55] Tucson he saw
[1:34:03] the seven angels pulling up brother Joe
[1:34:06] just the part now not the end set there
[1:34:11] you go turn it over
[1:34:13] don't leave it like that turn it to
[1:34:15] we're supposed to be I'm supposed to be
[1:34:20] laying down and he ain't getting with it
[1:34:26] they can't can you flip it I'll flip the
[1:34:29] screen it everybody know what I'm saying
[1:34:32] you can't flip it
[1:34:34] alright now alright
[1:34:39] rotate it that is the original one right
[1:34:45] not up this way that is he written one
[1:34:50] he says on spiritual food said they told
[1:34:53] him to turn it to the right he was told
[1:34:59] to turn it to the right he didn't even
[1:35:01] see it when all of that he was told to
[1:35:03] turn it to the right now you've got this
[1:35:08] one earn it you say that's left no you
[1:35:15] got to go to wave lines it up I asked
[1:35:22] you a question oh he got it
[1:35:24] okay I asked you a simple question
[1:35:28] we Steve was pardoned went on the rider
[1:35:33] the one on the Left believe that there's
[1:35:40] what was seen in Arizona and he says
[1:35:43] here's the Angels there's been a lot of
[1:35:45] things been said in there here's an
[1:35:47] Indian with his nose his mouth in an
[1:35:51] Indian turn it right now put it like
[1:35:56] where you had it okay and when you turn
[1:35:59] it right I'll read it listen he's
[1:36:02] talking about the pyramid that wind that
[1:36:05] went up the big observation from way
[1:36:09] back in California and Mexico and Dane
[1:36:12] and the Lord told him in paragraph 85
[1:36:15] one day turning it to the right looking
[1:36:18] there was Jesus Christ just as perfect
[1:36:21] as Hoffman never drove him he says
[1:36:26] that's Austin now I want you to put
[1:36:31] Hoffman in there which way you don't
[1:36:41] turn
[1:36:51] you looking at away which way you going
[1:36:54] plea
[1:37:05] he said to make the heavens declare it
[1:37:06] the Bible declares it the message
[1:37:09] declares it first time I ever seen him
[1:37:13] he looked like the head of hoffmann I
[1:37:15] had never seen that before and in Billy
[1:37:18] Sunday's Tabernacle years ago I saw it
[1:37:20] my house hasn't been without one of the
[1:37:23] pictures since then there in the sky
[1:37:25] saying that the very God that I saw up
[1:37:28] in this vision out in here just a little
[1:37:30] boy out here by where the schoolhouse
[1:37:33] stand he looked like that and in the
[1:37:36] heavens thirty-three years later the
[1:37:38] Claridge that is true that's the way he
[1:37:41] looks now as I said
[1:37:55] you can't put that in there he's looking
[1:38:01] the wrong right he's looking the wrong
[1:38:08] way our eyes there's the mobilizer thing
[1:38:14] some of them are gone and made
[1:38:15] differently but you can't put him at
[1:38:18] night that way right this is nothing
[1:38:23] brother Joe
[1:38:24] there's your Hoffmans in the cloud do
[1:38:33] you follow me
[1:38:34] you can't put the picture in to go that
[1:38:37] way
[1:38:47] there's Hoffman future in what he said
[1:38:51] and it was remember here he's turning
[1:39:03] that away talking to the rich young
[1:39:05] ruler I asked you a simple question
[1:39:13] musicians get ready with Steve on which
[1:39:18] side of Jesus did he pardon
[1:39:25] right or left
[1:39:31] Hoffman's disappear perfect
[1:39:36] what about it is your God real enough
[1:39:44] that you can see him and know what he
[1:39:49] looks like
[1:39:55] is he a being is he a person is he real
[1:40:06] was it matter what you look fly oh I
[1:40:09] won't go get paid a little extra benefit
[1:40:19] we get to see what he looks like
[1:40:22] is that any problem it's any problem
[1:40:32] just think about we could actually see
[1:40:35] what he looks like
[1:40:42] what about it
[1:40:44] come on musicians what about it how real
[1:40:51] is your God now there's no need to think
[1:40:58] about it anything for you to turn around
[1:41:02] on and go around to the world and say
[1:41:04] this is my Jesus this what my Jesus
[1:41:08] looks like that ain't gonna try to
[1:41:10] convert nobody we ain't out there trying
[1:41:13] to convert I ain't trying to convert
[1:41:15] nobody on the internet I preach to this
[1:41:18] church you out there or listening to see
[1:41:21] and do what you want - I'm not your
[1:41:23] pastor only pastor at this church
[1:41:34] what is your guard up well my god looks
[1:41:37] like this over here well then show me
[1:41:39] where it compares with the Prophet but
[1:41:42] what he saw all of those years when he
[1:41:45] saw him out in the field when he seen
[1:41:49] him many times and he finally come to it
[1:41:54] he said wait a minute
[1:41:56] where did he come to it where did he
[1:42:00] come to him - who the visible now
[1:42:06] for a minute I laid down a situation
[1:42:11] before you that the Prophet said for you
[1:42:17] to be able to pick up that picture it
[1:42:19] shows the halo above him is copyrighted
[1:42:22] up in Washington DC hang in there
[1:42:24] religious Hall of Arts but for you to be
[1:42:26] able to see that picture it's more real
[1:42:28] and it would be if you were standing
[1:42:30] there today it took place because the
[1:42:33] camera will not take psychology brother
[1:42:40] branham stood there in Arizona
[1:42:44] insult Jesus the way the Book of
[1:42:49] Revelations describes him the book of
[1:42:54] Revelation in chapter 1 scene 1 standing
[1:42:57] in the midst of the seven golden
[1:42:58] candlesticks like unto the Son of Man
[1:43:01] Girt about the paps with a golden girdle
[1:43:04] that vision has to go all the way and
[1:43:07] climaxing in the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:43:12] what he's been around see out there I'll
[1:43:18] read it to you haven't laying out where
[1:43:20] he said look at his eyes look at his
[1:43:21] beard look at the things he said it's
[1:43:24] just like Hoffman but who did he say he
[1:43:30] saw Jesus what do you want to see let's
[1:43:33] take what do you want to see we'll see
[1:43:39] Jesus now that the opportunity to be
[1:43:43] able to understand what Jesus looks like
[1:43:51] but what good is it to understand what a
[1:43:54] Jesus looks like to try to place it off
[1:43:56] if you don't believe he's real are you
[1:44:00] listening you don't believe he's a real
[1:44:03] person then he can't have his picture
[1:44:05] made
[1:44:12] if he's just a myth he can't have his
[1:44:15] picture money if you believe his picture
[1:44:20] was made and we believe it looked like
[1:44:22] Hofmann you've got to be at least to
[1:44:26] start to believe in that God is real
[1:44:32] what about it now real is your God
[1:44:45] but president you just don't understand
[1:44:47] I'm secured because I'm afraid that God
[1:44:51] is listen you don't understand human
[1:44:55] terminologies do you realize that to say
[1:44:59] that God is a real person you're putting
[1:45:03] him to a situation of bringing him not
[1:45:06] limited but bringing him into reality
[1:45:11] and that he's not by doing that under
[1:45:16] pressure do you understand why would you
[1:45:24] not be more scared of a spirit that's
[1:45:27] everywhere and knows all of your
[1:45:30] thoughts and your ways and he did it you
[1:45:35] didn't listen if he's a spirit has ever
[1:45:40] worked he knows every move every thought
[1:45:42] ever done he knows that he says it if
[1:45:44] he's a scary now let's go into the Bible
[1:45:50] I thought according to the Bible that if
[1:45:58] I confess my sins the Bible said what
[1:46:01] he's just and will forgive able to judge
[1:46:08] now does he see those sins after you've
[1:46:12] repented where their mama said see if
[1:46:18] forgetfulness never to be remembered no
[1:46:20] more far as the east of the Western
[1:46:22] ain't no far too easy with you go easy
[1:46:24] to come back we're at least welcome any
[1:46:25] there is if it's a North and South they
[1:46:28] would have limitations you can't see
[1:46:32] your sins because they're under the
[1:46:33] blood of Jesus Christ
[1:46:35] this blood world is covered by bumper
[1:46:37] blood of Jesus Christ and he can't see
[1:46:41] your sins why would you not want him
[1:46:43] call you like that
[1:46:44] Oh God how do I do it I tried to preach
[1:46:48] it years ago and got in trouble how do
[1:46:49] you preach a limit in God you don't want
[1:46:53] to be there saying that he said I don't
[1:46:55] remember
[1:47:00] he limits himself they blur and he said
[1:47:05] I don't remember your fin how come cuz
[1:47:13] it were annihilated not just forgiven
[1:47:19] annihilated are we still in the Bible we
[1:47:27] understand what it mean
[1:47:28] I mean he said well brother down you're
[1:47:33] trying to make him real like some kind
[1:47:35] of something with that realgar if he is
[1:47:38] that then he limits himself to that and
[1:47:41] by him being if he was a spirit he'd see
[1:47:44] everything over here and he'd have to
[1:47:46] remember all of my sins are you with me
[1:47:55] but if he's a person on the beating and
[1:47:58] by his own word he can lop it's like so
[1:48:02] clean until they can't be remembered and
[1:48:09] I quote brother Brandon let me never
[1:48:12] remember he back there say something
[1:48:14] paraphrase of his clothes he said I
[1:48:19] can't bring out from under the blood
[1:48:21] what somebody has put on the dock if you
[1:48:28] don't believe that it's a bit of quote
[1:48:29] you oughta believe it for reality I
[1:48:36] can't see what somebody's put under the
[1:48:38] blood Oh what did I go ahead I'm sorry
