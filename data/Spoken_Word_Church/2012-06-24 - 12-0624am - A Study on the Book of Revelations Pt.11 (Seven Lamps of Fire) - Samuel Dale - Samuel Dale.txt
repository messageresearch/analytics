study will be on the first Saturday in July which I think is the 7th okay the topic is general questions and answers 6:00 in the afternoon all right then on July the 14th will be a ministers meeting for ministers only here at the church all right it will be starting at what 10:00 10:00 and go till 4 or whatever all right so remember that then the next weekend will be which will be the 21st will be the fellowship meeting at brother um Tom kain's so we just remember these and all of the announcements I think that's all uh Brother Ray Gabriel called this morning and he's not able to be with us you know cuz he's chauffers down in Florida so he he said he's going to be watching us today so we can say Hey brother right and uh so but he said called to tell us that his brother was was doing better we appreciate the Lord being with his brother and taking care of him and pray that the Lord will will continue to make him well amen now I've noticed that by our children starting the Sunday school you know about 10 minutes earlier then they're able to get out you know 10 minutes earlier and they're getting out about 20 after so that's putting it a little less strain on the back back there of everybody trying to come in and out to do it we really appreciate that appreciate all of the things that's uh going on and all like that amen we appreciate it uh when is the um Dave Ramsey thing August 5th starts on August the 5th was in July that's when they're trying to change and they're getting everything set up to where they can uh watch the the videos and things they have to down in the basement and Richard was up yesterday working all day on that we appreciate all these things that everybody does to to be able to you know have what we need okay any other announcements I generally miss something somewhere but just remember that uh brother uh Richard Wilson I talked to him this morning morning he said to remember brother Donnie Moore he's going back to the doctor pretty quick but he's losing a lot of weight as much as like 2 lb a day and that's not good but said it was a normal thing to lose weight during the type of operation you know that he had the open heart surgery or what you call it bypasses but just remember him and keep him in your prayers okay amen Revelations 3 de Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for your love and your grace unto us we thank you for the day and the hour that we have the time that we're here upon the Earth and Lord we pray that you would just bless us with understanding and give us this day that daily bread that we desire of you and Lord help us to walk in the light of your love we need you so much father and we we just pray that you would just show us thy ways that we may walk therein forgive our sins L those that are sick among us God it's a promise you said you'd send your word and heal us and Deliver us from our destruction so we depend upon you and Lord you come down today and Lord honor your word you know what we've asked in our heart so you come down and and just deliver the people and take care of everything Lord we need you we love you we thank you in Jesus name amen we got a handkerchief we're running out of prayer cloths so we got a handker up here today now don't worry about it's clean look at somebody look handkerchiefs yeah we have handkerchiefs we carry them in our pockets we carry them on our body cuz that's the way the Bible says for to do it then we bring it here and we preach over it we lay it down we cut it up make it into a prayer cloth so you know we've had to get some of those done today all right Revelations 3 excuse me Revelation 1 1 through 3 I told them three I guess they might have put it up okay they're doing better than I am I'm getting things messed up you to see us sometimes back there we walk in quotes and I come out handle ter I another hand another pass out to some of you that can't see good and we keep add-ons addons addons okay says the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servant things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who be record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that than they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein or the time is at hand you may be seated Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now we've been trying to uh you know cover some in the Book of Revelations and uh so just bear with us uh if it's not needful for you we'll bear with us to try to help others and you know uh ourselves to see the word of God and trying to speak on those things uh I heard just this week too that remember the I don't know about his family or whatever but remember brother lale passed away during this this past week either Friday Saturday or something but he was on up into his 90s and all but he went to be with the Lord so just remember the the family is there right now just kind of a little review because we try to do that on ever service just to back up a little to get it to me because you know it it just all ties together right well it's hard for me to stay here so you just jump in here and go on because I realize the human abilities of all of us that uh you know you know that it doesn't uh a lot of times we need the background of what it is and tie it together you know and uh you just didn't go to school one day and they said uh 1 + 1 is 2 the next day they said 2 + 2 is 4 the next day you know 4 + 4 is 8 they didn't do stuff like that you know they kept on with the 1 + 1 = 2 and they kept on until we got that right then they moved on up to you know uh 2 plus two right you know then that to you know it takes time in the understanding of the Gospel Amen to be able to follow the message especially to me in this book of Revelations because what is our whole point now the Book of Revelation shows it's the bride's book and it shows um never in a form of Jesus just standing somewhere by himself he's always with the bride you know or in Bride form right and and things like that and I hope that would would be better for us to understand and some that are on Internet that maybe have never heard these things then that would be a good thing to write down and then just read the book of Revelations yourself just read it over and over and over I invite you to because I that makes it you know a lot of people say well I wouldn't want to preach to people that that know you know as much as I do man even years ago told Brother Mo said if you give them them books they'll know what you know well that's what I want am I want you to know as much as I know then I don't have to spend so much time backgrounding I do enough as it is but I want you to study and and things and then that way you'll catch me if I miss it too all right but we covered now how that through the uh chapter 1 2 and three has been the basis of showing the church the bride of Christ as she's up on Earth and and her journey through and we'll pick back up in a minute in something with that maybe will help us but then we saw that the Rapture comes at the end of the seventh Church age as it's ending up the Rapture will come and the bride goes up in Revelations 4:1 and not seen until Revelations 19 amen all right see that way the bride does not go through the tribulation we thank God for those things and I just gave these to quote to not to put up on the screen but brother brandham says in Revelations uh G paragraph 24 revelation of Jesus Christ that the church goes up in Revelations 4 and not seen until Revelations 19 and then it's Israel from then on you say well that was in his early Ministry I put this in because people out there are listening and they got their doctrines and ideas you know and some people believe that brother Brandon preached this and then he changed here you know Etc well uh that would have been 19 1960 and uh 12:04 1960 the morning service well then he comes over to Feast of the trumpets that we gave to you preached in 1964 uh 719 and he covered how the the bride the church as he calls it the bride goes up in Revelations uh 4 and not seen until Revelations 19 all right so then we know that this is not covering as we're reading in the Book of Revelations we went over to the fourth chapter basically bypassing the church ages because that's self-explanatory and the message was given to them and then John is taken up in Revelations 4:1 as a type amen of the Rapture of the Bride of Jesus Christ now watch that in a minute I want to deal with it today in your mind while you're uh conscious not asleep listening to me this will be the point of today is to see that you know the bride going up in Revelations 4:1 she's not seen until Revelations 19 all right see people say but what about 107 what about this well we've covered those things I don't have the time to go into it uh but you go back and listen you can find it all right and then in covering it the we are not not a type no absolutely now Revelations 4:1 now listen to what I'm saying John goes up as a type y right all right and he sees what he sees okay but now Revelation 4:1 is not a typ amen that's right it's a reality amen that's right it's a literal position amen we'll repeat this in a minute over and over to you because that's what I want you to see that it's not a type then we'll get into Ezekiel and see that you can see the journey down through time of Israel and in the church ages right but then John when he goes up it's not a a journey it's a set position the prophet calls it all right so then I want that into your mind as you're thinking along with me to think about that what John is seeing now is the Bride of Jesus Christ after the Rapture amen yes not a top of the Rapture right amen if it's a top of the Rapture it just means something like uh you're going to be amazed in a minute maybe when I get to it I'll go ahead and make a statement and then you consider it uh when you're dealing with an Earthly Journey on Earth you can be dealing with cherubims fine but reality in real the real thing is that you're not dealing with geram you're dealing with reality amen all right when you see it in heaven in a heavenly scenes you can deal with cherubims right Angels Z right because we'll find out and have been trying to study that even like what was it we went through it uh of the 24 Elders see we went through that you know bringing in chapter 4 there the 24 Elders is the 12 apostles and the 12 Patriarchs that's from from U Revelations chapter 4 and then on down he even brother randam that was paragraph 74 then on down to paragraph 293 brother randam even said who is this and he calls it and says it is the 12 apostles 12 Patriarchs there's your 24 Elders all right now they are round about the throne and I wish you would read that carefully in in each one of your readings and you'll find these beasts when we get to them later you'll find that it'll say they're in the midst right Amen in like Revelations 1 shows him standing in the midst of the seven golden Candlestick amen and see people the people as I said they'll say well he was in the first church age but he wasn't in until the last Church age you know well then you've missed the whole Bible you miss what we'll talk about in a minute the seven spirits of God you miss all of those things trying to make some uh super duper Revelation that attracts the attention of the people right you know all right see then we don't need Super Duper all Revelation is super duper but if it's true Revelation now if it's Satan's they ain't too much super about it it ain't too much duper about it I don't know what that means but it just don't mean nothing to me all right now but then we went from that part of the 24 elders and we picked up that to show that this 24 Elders being I said the 12 apostles the 12 Patriarchs that's right all right the 12 apostles would cover the church ages right right the 12 12 Patriarchs would be covering the Old Testament uh bride of Jehovah whatever you want to call it uh you know the people of Israel and and their doings and and things like that and and it goes up and then we discovered that it jumps there from the scene of seeing the 24 Elders that it jumps to the point of seeing that this was a Throne of judgment right all right that was that was in our Liv kind of the message about verse 5 see that it turns into a throne of judgment not mercy so it goes to the white Throne judgment right so you got a vast gap between even the bases of John covering the 24 Elders covering the throne the one you know the the the one on the throne the different things and then jumping over there's a vast gap which covers all all of the Israel and everything you know and shows where they come in the Redemption and you wind up at White thr own judgment with this basis that you're seeing it all right now so we gave you those quotes from uh like Revelation chapter 4 uh paragraph 167 don't pull these up brother just jump on down we'll pick you up in a minute we'll get down to number seven all right and brother random talks about said this is not a throne of Mercy this is a throne of judgment he said you can scream all you want to at a throne of judgment he says there's no mercy all see now you just stand there as is all right then he goes to paragraph 307 chap Revelation 4 we read these over and over he said that's the bride of Christ sitting on his throne amen now sitting on the father's Throne yeah you remember that yes man now where where did the Father Strong start right all right now follow this point and you you'll catching what I'm trying to talk about if that is the Father Strong and brother R said it was we haven't got to that cuz that fulfill you know Revelations 3 21 or what it is where he said sit with me in my Throne as I've overcome s with my father and he is strong that's right see right now Jesus's Throne is not in existence here strong comes into existence right to the bases of where the Rapture would take place and we would be heading from there on through with the bride of Jesus Christ you can talk about his throne right really his throne is a millennial Reign amen right cuz he's promised the son of David to sit on his throne in the millennial Reign you'll understand when we get to it why I said tying right into the Rapture and going up because once we go up what does it matter where we go we're in eternity amen amen and see then it all will be made manifest but getting it right to the point see then that what we're looking at is the Father Strong right all right now I want to ask you a question cuz there's a lot today I want to deal with and and I just move as I can I write down as much as I can but I I I I just kind of wait to see what happens here and if I told you what happened about 2 weeks ago you you would probably say well oh okay but I didn't okay I really saw something cuz I was wondering where to go I write down notes you notice lately though all I've got is quotes very few notes I just write the quotes put them down and I'm trying to go from that to one to the other and you know I had a gap in where I was fixing to go and I couldn't figure out how to get there so I said look at I'll just preach I get there right right I mean I'll just preach up to it if I don't get there I'll just cut it off start another service I don't bother me I've done that over 40 years now that I may do that it may be 20 years before I start it back up again you know on that point but that doesn't bother me I don't have no problem I just I'm not just going to make that step just because I think I know what's going on I'm going to be able to tie into the prophet's message and the Bible where I'm not going to bring it out that's just the the best way all right so then the Bride of Jesus Christ sitting on his throne now see we're not just around the throne that's what my point is you you talk about a throne and then you put around the throne well remember you you better be able to at least put 12 of those Elders to sitting on the throne because that is the bride of Christ right it's the apostles down to the church you know in 12 Apostles right now so you'd have to be able to at at least TI that much into and I I caution you to read it always say in the midst right amen well see how could you draw it h how could you draw even seven golden Candlestick and him in the midst i' like to see that drawn out because you're going to put more of it in here then you put over here or something see because you'd have to draw the whole entire thing and you have to have it him draw over the top of all of it right but it's in the midst it means he's just as prevalent he Hebrews 138 he's the same in every age amen that's right so it don't mean that he was great in the first age and not too great in the middle and then become great and the end no that's his ministry the ministry that was back there and then coming over here to the ministry being restored again all right see then you would come to the Alpha and Omega to understand amen and you'd see that he is all in between amen all right but the main thing of what we're trying to see is the bride is sitting in the throne with him amen yes right not just sitting on the throne right be pretty crowded Throne you be a big old Throne I don't make it a joke I make it as plain sense but to see him in Christ being the throne the father's Throne right all right to see all of that and then to look and see us there that's just showing us where we're at we're what we're nothing without him right if it's anything what he done B said it is he that brother spoke on that years ago it is he that ha made us and not we ourselves we as people in the Sheep of his pasture y see then in that Throne is where we're sitting all right but now I want to ask you a simple question okay everybody ready simple I love questions amen the Bible says questions gender stri the prophet said questions makes a strong church now which one you're going to deal with I know questions that are tripal questions they ask Jesus questions to trap him those gender Strife but when they said over there would you explain this to us what does these Parables mean that was not a genderist argument what you call it that was not an argument that was him breaking it down to them because they'd asked him a simple question right amen see so then questions makes a strong church amen why because if we ask questions brother R said the question don't come first first the answer comes first then the question Falls to Earth all right now but what I want you to look at today now we're not talking about God's mind so don't get into God's mind with me don't get up here with God's mind he saw this and he saw that in his mind just just stay with me to get a point all right now did the throne in heaven develop Before the Throne on Earth developed in the heart of man well it's all same time now you talking about the mind of God now remember when John saw this was about ad 95 96 right right all right brother random in the seal book said we're seeing what happened in glory about 2,000 years ago so John on Patman ad 95 and 96 he's taken up into the future yes and he might not have comprehended totally what was going on so he gave us the types and the Shadows you know the symbols all but remember the kingdom had already come into the heart of John or he couldn't go to heaven to see anything Paul wouldn't takeen up to the third heaven while he was over there killing all of them Christians that's right come on get your story right is after Paul become converted could he be taken that's right it was after John become converted the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right on the day of Pentecost could he be able to be taken right and notice too God didn't take some of the others that were not listed as the The Upper Room experience right right cuz God don't use a novice you know a baby a child in the gospel to write his gospel because don't know how to write right he uses somebody that's anchored right look like he to use Peter because Jesus is speaking a lot of times up to Peter but Jesus never has to rebuke John we'll get into one of the days with the lon the ox the man the eagle Etc and you can go through your Matthew Mark Luke and John sure see Matthew would be the line Mark is the ox because of the symbolics Through The Book of Mark Y and then Luke being a wisdom smart man is the the man and then John is the eagle if you want to go prophetic go read the book of John that's right it's more prophetic than the other gospels and then he's chosen to go up and write the Book of Revelation amen Matthew Mark and Luke was a chosen John was chosen all right so get the point now what we're trying to bring so then John is not seeing something new John knows what has happened on Earth let said maybe he understand all of it that's all right right but yet the father is strong I've kept on that and over it to make sure it stays in your mind the Father Strong was the baptism of the Holy Ghost that came on day Pentecost right now I've read that to you showed it to you through the message the Father Strong was the baptism of the Holy Ghost right they come on the day of Pentecost amen that's why Jesus said you'll sit with me and my as I have overcome and sit with my father see he went straight up on the throne with what happened the Holy Ghost came back to start on the church here amen and identically the same thing as what would be there all right so now what you're looking at if you look at it correctly you'll look at the church ages and see that God has been traveling down through the church ages sure amen all right he's been in travel right all right now in doing that you'll see that the Throne of God began in the heart of man right amen the father's Throne began on the day of Pentecost in the heart of man that's right all right now sure we look at the positive look at the partial realization compared to perfect realization right okay fine and you can say well John went up and saw but what did John go up and see John went up and saw what would take place during the ages sure of the baptism of the Holy Ghost right amen right y simple John went up and saw what would happen on the Earth right through the ages all right now in doing that then see we better get our minds down here to where we're at right amen I've preached before to you and you know it we got to match what there yes that's true but if if you just keep your eyes on what's there and don't see what's here I'm sorry there's not much to go to there if that's all you can do that's so let's deal with what we deal here on Earth to see that God started his kingdom in on Earth in the soul of mankind and then when this is completed on earth when when this new birth this baptism of the Holy Ghost this statute of a perfect man adoption Etc the things the prophet spoke of that Jesus Christ become invisible Among Us Etc amen all right then there could be a Rapture as I said won't be a type right if you ain't careful you'll be typing something yeah that's right we're not a Tope of the new birth right amen we have the new birth amen we're not a type of eternal life we have eternal life amen your soul is just as Eternal y as it'll ever be by the new birth that's right the body and spirit yes is waiting for that to be done and that's what he's working on that's right all right but get that in your mind and and keep it there see we look over there and we see something but remember now that can't be there unless this is here right you know and it it means it has to take place that's right on Earth I was thinking this week because that's what I try to do just let my mind maybe you know I know what to is I don't mind of devil's workshop guess that's right but mine's not in Walmart is still in the bean field doing something you know taking care of the cattle or horses or something all right see I like to just think about where we're at and what we're doing what does all this mean to us there's no need of preaching what we will be until we realize what we are that's right when we realize what we are then we can think about what we will be but don't worry about it when we realize what we are we will be right because that's that's what's taking place that's right all right so then looking at it as seeing it see when Redemption is finally over here now I'm asking you a simple question to get a simple answer are we trying to go to heaven are we trying to bring Heaven here that's right right now I've said this over and over and over about 8,432 times I again we spent 6,000 years trying to prove there's a God in heaven he spent 6,000 years trying to prove he's down here all right there is a heaven right we believe in it there's a bride there's a Rapture there will be a heaven to go to yes but if that heaven is not in reality here upon Earth in the bride Jesus Christ there is no heaven to go to that's right so we are actually building when Jesus said I go to prepare a place for you he said in my father's house are many mansions said that's old that's new birth right all right he said I go to prepare a place for you where did he go he ain't up there with hammers and Nails another bodies up there but he went up come right back down into the heart preparing you and I right we're going to identically match that City or we don't go to the city that's right that's all I'm trying to get us to see here that's right but we're going to match the city Here Am amen that's right this is not one of those things boy it's going to be great when we get dark cuz really going to change things that's been our idea for 2,000 years in Christianity trying to make those things come to pass won't work why don't we just settle down and realize God is right here working on you and I one day we will go there that's right amen but see our problem is we want to try to think about oursel already being there yes we won't be there until the Rapture comes remember John was a type of the Rapture right not a type of 2,000 years before Rapture right it was the top of the Rapture he went up that's right but see one day we don't have we can't type it we're going to have to go up right but to do that it's going to have to match here exactly amen that's why the new birth is the most important thing in your life amen that's right see then we're not going to have a state of of appeal when we get di you know right it's going to be here right that's what I told you years ago and I may be the next one to pass on but I told you this 30 years ago and I don't have to back up probably might even be 40 said most of the people in this message are not going to be able to stand there for that last moment to be changed in a moment the twinkl of an eye so we're going by the grave that's right and we have to be what brother dick says come down to that basis of being waiting on somebody else y we might be standing here and them waiting on us but we die we're there waiting on somebody else to pull us out you say well old age is to do it n God's let people live 150 years old there's people in the world to they 114 or the oldest one like 114 I believe that's right you know that' be long ways for me but now listen Church what we want to do is see we we come up in the message and we heard it because we never we never thought about these things uh until we come in the message and then when we did we begin to look up and see something and that was wonderful but why not deal with where we're at that's right we not be concerned with where we are here that's right see and then you'll see that John T the rapture mhm now can I make a quote that is not a quote of brother randoms not only did John type the change of the body into going forth you know the things he just called a Rapture the prophet doesn't use it as a change of the body he uses it as a translation or something but you know that John was also a type of ever believer down through the age sure absolutely are you with me yes John was the type of every believer that will ever go in the r that's right that's right now don't try to find that brother R is that's a Dale quote okay and I don't mind saying it but sure doesn't sound good to me because if not you just got John toping one thing no you top of all the bride in her journey down through time and then her journey up to the point of being changed that's why he had to have the man like he did to do it okay now so think about it when Redemption is over the Throne of God on earth and the heart of man will be identically the same position here on Earth as it is there in glory amen that's right all right no problems right that's right now so let's get to something cuz this is going to happen for the next two or three messages now let's read number seven brothers in the quotes CU I told him I said this evening but it's going to be worse than ever we're going to read the entire book of the entire fifth seal this afternoon you going to read off the screen but not all of it we w't take that long okay but look what your Prophet has to say here because we come up we better read that to where we can TI all together so let's read number let's read verse uh five of Revelations 4 verse 5 and out of the throne proceeded lightning thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning Before the Throne which are the seven spirits all right now we will be back to Ezekiel in a minute to pick that up to match it but I want to approach it in a way to where that you can understand what I'm trying to say about these lampstands we could go through all of the story of it but what does the prophet have to say this is taken Revelation if I was you I'd read L Revelation CH 4 there's about four parts of it this separ book a separate books all right now this is where 61101 Revelation 4 part two reflecting the light of God into the church now he's talking about the burning Before the Throne which are the seven spirits of God now we know there's not seven spirits of God we won't have to try to deal with that as much but we will be dealing with it in here because there's not seven spirits of God it's the spirit of God in seven Messengers bringing it but it's really the spirit of God in seven Church age people bringing forth God and brother brand said it's not seven spirits no more than Paul when he covers the uh the uh works and the and the spirit and a different thing you know the manifestation there in Corinthians right it's all of the Same Spirit that's right right so it's not seven spirits reflecting the light of God into the church right straight from the Throne of God not through a seminary not through some Bishop but from the Throne of God yep now remember right remember the other day when I was trying to preach on it when I said that I was certainly glad that over in the Bible L that it didn't say that when uh who was it um my goodness uh laid down and he saw the throne open and Jacob all right and the Angels were ascending and descending right it doesn't say descending and ascending right that's totally reverse this thing's not that way this thing is here right right all right the Angels were going from Jacob taking his offering up to God and then bringing back the rewards to Jacob right so keep that in your mind what you're talking about so he's talking about the light of the reflecting here where from but from the Throne of God how by a revelation of the power of His Resurrection making him the same yesterday today and forever and the Seven Stars standing there reflecting that light the sh kind of light from this sh kind of Glory from the holiest of holy seven lamps on fire sitting on top of these candlesticks reflecting the light his colors of his power of his resurrection right into the church now you know what EAS that's you got you candlesticks and then you got the light of each one you know how each one was lit it was originally lit from the the alar of God and then you let number one then you would like number two from number one and number three from number two Etc coming all down CU it all from the sign right all right now watching we won't be over with our dealing with the beast but I've got to get this to you where you'll see it then he covers the scripture Before the Throne there was sh of life like under crystal in the midst of the throne and round about now remember in the midst of and round about now draw that for me how can something be in the midst and a roundabout it's just all there it's not the whole thing's him if he's in the midst of it it's just everything there him whether it's round about or the throne or whatever it is that's what I'm trying to get you to see and it's right here in our hearts is where all of this is taking place huh he said well how can you get all them beast and them 24 hours remember your salvation whether you want to agree or not came from the Jews because they turned it down so the 24 Elders the 12 of Patriarchs brought the Salvation to us the 12 apostles is telling us about the salvation that's right see so it's it's it's all revelation of Jesus Christ where he's at he's right here in you and me right all right that's what all this is talking about seea of glass and crystal in the midst of the throne round about The Throne or four beasts full of eyes before and behind all right now remember we're dealing with lamps LS all right but watch and he goes ahead and he begins to give this these Beast now see you're going to have to tie it together while I'm using the the the lampstands the things together with the because the lampstands and all of these things is a church right right all right now he's covering beast but look what he's tying it back to he's already brought the reflecting of the light of the shine of Glory now he come what and he goes ahead and he begins to give this these beasts the same thing Ezekiel Saw y them guards one like a manand one like a lion one like a eagle what was it now watch when we bring them in and show that L of the tribe of Judah and all of those different ones out of their tribes that sat on four walls Y and they were guarding this mercy seat oh what a picture I just there's great days ahead now let's go to Ezekiel when he said Ezekiel the same thing Ezekiel Saw right now remember lampstands seven lampstands candlesticks everything but Ezekiel sees it the same thing are you with me Ezekiel sees the same thing go ahead and pull up Ezekiel now and look all right I just chose 4 through6 you need to read the whole thing right and I looked and behold a whirlwind came out of the North a great cloud and a fire unfolding infolding I like that too it said not unfolding it's infolding it's coming Inward and the brightness was about it this Holy Ghost In Me can go out that way but I love for it to come this way you know I enjoy it trying to help you but I enjoy it coming this way right I enjoy the infolding and the brightness was about it out of the midst thereof was a color of amber out of the midst of the fire now let's steal the lamp right stand set fire all right also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures and this was their appearance they had the likeness of a man and everyone had four faces and everyone had four wings it was likeness of a man in other words it it was upright it was doing it was you know wouldn't likeness of a beast or a cow or a horse or you it ties together with the baptism of the Holy Ghost here all right and everyone had four faces and everyone had four wings and their feet were straight feet and the soul to their feet was like the so of the cast foot and they sparkled like the color of of the color of burned burnished Bry raise and they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides and they had their faces and their wings their wings were joined one to another they turned not when they went they went everyone straight forward now draw that four of them each one looking in different directions and they're going straight yep each one of us going straight ahead y right you explain drawing the further they go the further away they get all right we going to see what that all means and for the likes their face they had the face of a man the face of a lion on the right side and they four had the face of an ox on the left side and they four also had the face of an eagle so there's you line the ox the man The Eagle right now watch thus were their faces and their wings were stretched upward two Wings all right to save all of the reading drop it on down to the 16th where we'll see what it is and everybody ought to know this verse of what it is what and the appearance of the wheels now these living living creatures they're moving right but look what it is and the appearance of the wheels and their Works was like unto the color of burl and they four had one likeness and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of the wheel all everybody knows the song wheel in the middle of the wheel what is it the Little Wheel runs by faith the big wheel runs by the word of God wheel in the meal wheel way in the middle of the a now do you know what that means do you know what it means of the wheel in the middle of the wheel some are saying yes and some are saying no and some are saying I don't know see it's got two things Ezekiel is describing two things y That's Right the wheel in the middle of the wheel is Jesus Christ we know that simple right and you put it in the heart of man it's in the new world simple right all right but he's describing what's taking place now I want to read this to you in a second he's describing what's taking place y all right now you got all these beasts you got all these things and you know what that all means when Ezekiel first saw it he's describing two things he's describing Israel and he's going to describe the bride so we're going to get both of them right okay that's right Ezekiel is describing the wheel in the middle of the wheel the Beast the doings you know what that is that's Israel in their Journey Through the wilderness right now we're going to read where the Prophet says just a minute right so all these symbols and all these things what is it it's Israel and their Journey right I remember when I first read that I used to read that and wonder what it is don't we all try to figure out that wheel in the middle of the wheel way in the middle of the a you know we' all say well that was Jesus Christ we could figure those things out a little bit but we couldn't figure out why all these combat beasts and all these appears and what they was doing and all that well that's just symbols that we don't understand hand when that Prophet said it that's right he said that's Israel in their travel yep I shout it cuz I knew it was Christ in Israel and all of their Journey right I could read that not Jesus the flesh Christ was there Amen to lead the children of Israel is the pillar of fire of the things that were there and there to be with each one of those men that would conquer ations Etc and things that happen it was Israel under their Journey let's just read that go ahead with I didn't give them a number I gave some of you s but go to Revelations 4 part 3 and let's just read this and there you living creatures there's your Ezekiel that we just read that's what he's reading coming down Ezekiel okay now he's going to explain it he said what's the symbol there what's the symbol here brother Ram what is it it means that these guards these guards was God's Ark they were in Journey Rolling On Wheels when Ezekiel Saw them Rolling On Wheels the Journey of Israel was what Ezekiel was describing right now look they were in Journey Rolling On Wheels when Ezekiel Saw but when John saw them watch you they had already come into their right position in heaven 41 or four really four five the Ark of God was on Earth Rolling On Wheels yep as they took it from place to place me it was in travel they took it all the way through the Wilderness and all the way into the Temple and so forth but now it's received up because the church ages over and it's received up into Glory sea it's stationary now in heaven with all the angels and things around around it we find them after a while taking off their crowns and the guards of the Temple now we'll get to that later but I want you to see that brother random was one that was tying it together he said he was talking about the lampstands and all he said Ezekiel Saw the same thing sure okay now here's the catch of what I want you to get Ezekiel Saw the Journey of Israel and described it as wheels turning on a like a cart you know like Ark and being pulled by animals and being but he really saw the travel of Israel right right he saw him on in Journey on earth right and he called them living creatures that's right all right but see once the symbols broke you see he was looking at the Trav of Israel right it's like Ezekiel Saw believe this right Ezekiel Saw fire falling down out of Heaven he saw the end time with atomic destruction in he right sure like nonon saw chariots jostling in the street running like lightning he saw cars down here running forth with headlights on right he thank God for the profit and bringing the symbols right man but now remember what he said Ezekiel Saw the Journey of Israel all right John saw it after it's reached its position in heaven but then you can see the wheel in the middle of the wheel is what it's been the Journey of the Bride of Jesus Christ that's right amen down through seven Church ages right we'll get to those combat Beast later bring it out and bring it out even to show Matthew Mark Luke and John but the main thing I wanted you to get was what he said Ezekiel Saw the Journey of Israel while on Earth John in the fourth chapter SE had already taken his place but what about your journey and my journey amen that's right what about our wheel in the middle of the wheel amen the wheel in the middle of the wheel to Israel was Christ right right amen what about our wheel in the middle of the wheel right what about our journey that we're traveling what about what we're doing now changing from Mercy Seat to judgment seat changing to show us the seven lampstands jump on over to quote number 10 Brothers we'll leave out all these others number nine covers that it's the day of Mercy is over and it's covering the when the church is raptured to Mercy Seat becomes a judgment seat that's right when we go up Mercy is over for the Gentiles amen that's right Mercy Seat will automatically become judgment seat that's correct amen so let's don't spiritualize us getting there so much yeah right let's take the journey we're in amen that's right let's take these lamp stands as we read while ago Revelation 4 part three paragraph 125 seven lamps let's draw a little bit here the throne the holy place the congregation and right here with 1 2 3 4 56 seven seven stars seven lamps seven Messengers seven spirits not all together meaning that God is in seven Spirit but seven manifestations of the same holy spirit amen now Church we're doing our journey now we're in the journey Ezekiel Saw of Israel which was a right that's right Israel in Journey was a type of our our journey that's right we're not in a type we're the antitype right we're in reality they didn't have the new birth in the Old Testament that's right they didn't have the Seal of God in their soul by the new birth right right CU they could only type what you and I doing so if Ezekiel Saw Israel in Journey and described it with all these combat beasts and all these lights and Perfections and the thing what about God and what he's seeing her the little bride that she's been traveling down through seven Church ages y she's been in Journey and God's been with her pleased to dwell he said amen you know what he's just as pleased to dwell with Luther as he D pleased to dwell with you you might not like that but that's that's right gospel truth no I'm special I'm right next to the Drone all right if you're right next to the throne if you're the seventh one let me be carnal for a minute he said he was in the midst of the seven golden Candlestick cuz that put him in the first in the the what church ages would he be in that would put him here more than he is with you so you better back up on what you're saying you see how people want to run around and make all kind of statements oh he's here now that wasn't nothing like there man stood right here and said it years ago big man in this message and he said the prophet said Luther and Wesley and Pentecost was false I had done challenged him on that down at the school house it guiltful and asked him for the quo I said brother Brandon said he was a never Church age he came on right up here didn't change his mind of course he couldn't preach error anyway so my saying something to him wouldn't change it he came right don't hear any he preached and he said that Luther and Wesley and Pentecost was false I don't agree with that and like I said if you're going to be the natural carnal with statements then if he was in the mid that mean he was more back there in Luther and wesle than he is here now the people don't realize what you're doing but people that are listening don't realize what they're listening to oh ain't that something look at w was false brother so said it was well I don't give a who what brother so and so says or what I say it's what the prophet of God had to say about it right we know what the prophet of God had to say about it come from God of course now they're all trying to S brother Rand was so wrong yeah you all of his errors and all of these things yeah go ahead it's got to be there must needs be heresies among you the they that are approved may be made manifest we just keep walking on with the truth seven lamps is what the seven spirits of God the seven manifestations of the Holy Spirit down through seven Church ages as our journey was taking place see John sees it already in heaven with right that right Ezekiel Saw while we on while they was on Earth dark and he sees our journey right ain't that something I it it don't stir your heart to think that a prophet would be brought to us to tell us these things am when somebody else say well I think that really means here you know I think that that wheel means this and this means that and that's go there and that means this and them Bo them Beast and all these things and and don't even know there's two different types of beast in the Bible in the Book of Revelation we'll get that this evening one of them is a zoom z o n that's the correct one that's right the other one is t h e r i o n I believe way you spell itones which means untable unconverted that's right you can't tame them n that's right you ain't going to change them no that's right you ain't going to change the people this message that's correct amen I I hate to say this something like hard sometime maybe for the Holy Ghost to even converted yeah right I don't mean that wrong I believe the Holy Ghost can change anybody but if we don't voluntarily get in there and do what's right he ain't going to make us change and we could wind up being the Theon like I told you brother here preach I saw my S as a white horse rider he said then I got converted I said brother if you're the white horse rider you're the Antichrist which means a Theon beast and you can't be converted that didn't change his ideas but you see Church what are we do you understand when Ezekiel is asking you do you understand the wheel the Middle with some of you did some didn't H but the ones that said you did understand what did you see it this this the wheel in the middle of wheel being Jesus Christ you know that Jesus Christ was back there in their Journey leading the children of Israel I'll send my angel he'll go before thee I'm quot scripture right and my name will be in him and you better mind him in other words brother R said I used to wonder who could tell God a better way of doing something there in Moses he said I found out it was Christ in Moses amen there was your wheel in the middle of the wheel that led right up to Calvary right amen right but then it started in the church ages and remember what I saying to start with we got to be able to see here right what's there it's being developed here God's strong is being made here in the heart of mankind well brother I just see myself there I don't worry about them deep things I I just see myself step side what my brother around said he seen me yeah he said he seen people in Hell also I ain't mean that's true he's in both places and seen people you see that's where people just just they just say well well that's why we've been here 40 something years the reason we've been here 40 something years is for the bride of Christ to try to get anchored in the word and to get worse you won't be blown by these little 6i doctrines that's right I told you 40 years ago when the two souls in those doctrines were out first starting I said you think that's deceiving I said this ain't deceiving right I said because they can't even quote correctly right you remember the two Soul was the soul was just the nature go read the book it doesn't say that soul is the nature of the spirit don't even use the word just they can't even quote but I said they'll come a time when they'll be using Brother ran them as quotes to prove their point look at them now well brother that that brother he he gave 24 quotes all right Amen brother R said it sure but what's the truth right like a man said to brother dick one day because brother dick said he agreed with what I said he said do you understand what he nobody said explain it to me in your words something like that he said put it in your words you know if you can't put this message in your words right y you're just quoting what somebody else says that's right amen and is that what the scripture says no man can call Jesus the Christ except it be my personal experience with him right the seven lampstands what are they and the message called Pat Vision ion we won't pull these up I'll just read a few just quote a few of them patmas Vision which is actually page 50 Church age book It's a Wonderful type of the Holy Ghost in the seven Church ages the original outpouring of Pentecost which outpouring came direct from Jesus on The Mercy Seat is enduring his church through all the Seven Ages and showing forth perfectly that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever now so we'll to set few words real quick so if you notice that when I was trying to bring Revelations 4:1 and I said that all of this was showing the bride of Christ but then when I came to Revelations 4 about five there or 4 four I guess I had a gap there because it jumped from Mercy to judgment come on is I right I get a scripture right where it comes the fourth verse that it turn to Thunders and Lightnings Etc the prophet said this is Judgment or 45 you see right we can look up there right now and I believe Redemption is not over yet that's right see people said that 1963 I told men I said according to my Bible and the prophet Redemption was over for the foundation of world if that's where you're going with your carnality because my Bible said Jesus Christ stood the land of slame before the foundation of the world but see they thought 63 something happened I agree something happened in 63 I agree 100% yes sir me it was wonderful what happened there amen because God brought us the word through a man amen and brought his message amen but you see when you first look at John on patmas remember he's seeing this as it's happening now are you listening yes he's seeing this as is happening on Earth cuz you got to compare that's right right but when it comes to thunder and lightning ain't no bright on Earth and you know that he's on the mercy seat and you know that what you're seeing in Revelations 41 through about 4 is still he's on The Mercy Seat Revelations 4:5 I think where it says Thunders and lighten let's make sure let's just read that that's right it'll be 4 five yeah and out of the throne proceeded Lightnings and it becomes a judgment seat you better hope it's not to that place right because judgment will be over for the Gentiles at the Rapture of the bride of Christ so if that's already the Judgment seat we're in problems because we're still on Earth no we went up 4 one could that Revelation could that be that John was taken up as a type what your Prophet said could it be that in the Bride of Jesus Christ is the Throne of God you see when redemption's over the only thing that's going to take care of you and I is the fact of what's inside of us CU Redemption is going to be over before we leave this world right yes sir amen that's what scared the people to death when brother around preached anointed ones at the end time souls in prison especially they kept saying is it over he said I really don't know I well you know there's only one reason that I know it wasn't over in ' 63 Butz I wasn't born again then I didn't get born again in 1969 how many of you was born again after 63 right amen we know that's a good reason to believe that we know 63 amen you know that's the way I believe I'm just that's honest that's you said well well God ain't going to change nothing for you no he ain't going to change nothing for me but why would people believe Redemption is over when your Prophet would still give all their calls and why would he say those people that receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost after 63 right you see it's all in the doctrine yes right why would you think that your children couldn't be saved because they didn't get saved for 63 but you did what kind of a spirit is that like I always told you there was a Doctrine over in South Carolina that this man started a Doctrine and she wasn't supposed to live with your wife anymore all that was over with he's 80 something years old not making a joke true people that said Redemption is over 63 you better believe they believe they got Sav before 63 right yep but why wouldn't you want it for anybody else amen I didn't open Redemption and I cannot close it right amen but God one day will close it right correct see then Revelations 4 it'll become a judgment seat because it's no longer Mercy when the bride reaches that place Redemption will be over and she manifest her part upon Earth to be what she's supposed to be right Redemption will be over amen nobody will be saved after the except Israel 144,000 Jews later on in the church tribulation right ain't no foolish virgins to be saved in the tribulation that we were taught by organized religion right they teaches a three and 1/2 years minor three and 1/2 years major and they think that's what brother random taught about it but he never did he only it's only three and half years tribulation right amen that's organized religion they think you get these movies that's all Left Behind Etc and and all of these you watch in the movie their point the Rapture goes up and then over here these people's getting saved they may be running them down and killing them but they're getting salvation some way that's their whole point you don't make it one way maybe we'll make it another way you ever heard people say that I'm sorry I don't have no second point right I'm up number one or I ain't going to be you know what I mean right I'm either going to be the bride or I'm going to be lost right amen I've always told you and I know it wouldn't like to hear cuz some made remarks about it I always told you I quoted brother brandom brother Bram said if I'm want to be a Antichrist I want to be a good one you know that quote's real and you know that's what I said I said if I want to be a deceiver I want to be a good one so you going to better be in you better and the one fell said I don't want one person here said I don't want that being told to my people I just told you what brother R said he said if I want to be an antichrist I me if I'm going to be an antichrist I'm going be a good one if I'm going to try my best to help this bride it don't matter to me whether I go to hell or not right that's correct all I want to do is help somebody to see Jesus Christ that's my goal my desire amen what makes you preach brother Dale in the line of all the things i' have quit for 30 years ago but I want to see people saved amen that's right I want to see you there yep whether I make it or not I want to see my children I want them to have an opportunity to hear the truth I want my grandchildren to have an opportunity to hear the truth I want my great grand kids man and they got a whole lot of adopted when sitting out there that's right that I want you to see the truth that's right amen but to think that God would show Ezekiel the travel of Israel show it in symbols and things that people would wonder what that is see our journey in travel now through seven Church ages through these combat beasts that's our traveling Journey right amen I'm not worried about what's in heaven right right I want to see what's down here amen then when I go up there then hey that'd be wonderful but what about it church this is either Christ or nothing that's right right cuz you're in a day whether we're either Christ or we're Antichrist there is no white black bird there is no white black dog there is no good sinner Saint right right that's right we're either Christ or we're Antichrist you know we make the choice yes that's right come on brother we make the choice right of what it's to be yes it can be Christ in you the hope of glory or we can be the Antichrist lampstands all of these things represents the Bride of Jesus Christ but see we want to go up to hell and to see it I want to see it here amen that's right I want to see the manifestation that I told you the other day where they said when we first came into message you know the doctrine was around we don't need manifested sons that going to be in the Millennium I'm not kidding you that this was Doctrine we don't need manifested Sons we need a we got the doctors to go to we got all these things we're going to need we're going to have manifested sons in the Millennium and I finally found where the prophet of God said we don't need manifested sons in the Millennium we need them now you know that didn't change anybody no I never heard one person I'm truthful I never heard one person say I was wrong and that quote straightened me out not one because you see we're either theor or we're in yeah go we're all Beast Y which we're either Christians or we're lost right the Book of Revelation shows the Beast four combat Beast there's four Beast to take us down right yep what are we going to do we have the choice well I just don't understand I don't understand why why because it's simple amen Ezekiel all Israel in Journey right all them types and all them things is you and I in Journey right amen only of these things we're talking about The Throne of God starting on Earth in the heart of man amen by the New Birth will one day go there and be that throne but is it that we're going to go there that's where we hooked up from I thought that we meet Jesus in the a I didn't know we met him on throne see we try to figure it all out brother R said even that lamb that took the book he said it was back behind or in the throne come forth come around in front and took the book climbed up on the throne and said I am 26 I believe there souls in prison I know it's the souls in prison they climbed up on the throne and sat down and said become the one on the throne you see we're trying to figure all that out just think about what's taking place in your own life right you know that God is trying to become on a throne in your heart and my heart right you know we're the ones that's keeping him off the throne it's not our stealing and gambling and running around this that the other no no no is our little things right just your everyday life that's right think on these things what thing what we got 204 204 in spiral book 204 in a spiral book anybody have a name there is God your heart shall come no more clouds in the no more tear for glorious myus I shall see upon his face the one who sa me his he me by
