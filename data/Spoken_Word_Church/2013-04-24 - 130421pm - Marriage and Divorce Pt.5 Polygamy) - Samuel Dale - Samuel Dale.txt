house of the Lord good to see everybody if you'd like turn in your scriptures turn to where we've been reading from Matthew 19 and we'll try to continue our thought from this morning but we want to thank everybody for all of the gifts the cards and and everything and the the welcome from your heart and appreciate it for us and all for our birthday and we also thank you very much for all of you men women and everything for the great wonderful meal it was delicious it was I just ate too much of it that was the worst thing but if you'll excuse my amens this evening they'll probably be burps a little bit you know but that's all right and just pray that the Lord would bless remember the announcements we made the uh Bible study will be the first Saturday in May the topic will be the doctrines of the message and if you don't come now we make a copy of this all right it's not necessarily to go out to the public because we don't put it on the internet because it's more or less private to us here but to you local congregation and things counting this your church home then uh you can you can get the those if you request it from brother Joe he makes some copies we copy the Bible study so you know if you want them you can have them and also then the fellowship meeting will be the third Saturday uh and if there any anybody that needs a place to stay from out of town let us know we'd be glad to take care of it and everything to where you don't have to come up on Saturday you know for the fellowship meeting go back home and come back we're always pleased to do that and there's plenty of people that would be glad to let you stay in their home with them you know and everything and just just remember that the main thing that we say you come and stay with us on a fellowship meeting night like that and uh maybe you get breakfast the next morning but you don't get lunch for the for the next day you have to provide your own from then on but we do do that but just do those things and uh you know there's a list downstairs you put it down and and anybody that sees that can say we'll take this one we'll take that one but we we try to make everybody as comfortable as we can to do what we can and brother Jonathan Jones I've never heard him preach he was actually brother Jimmy Gibson's son-in-law and I've never heard him preach so it' be a a great thing for all of us to heard a lot of good reports about him but never heard him so just remember that uh any other announcements um no announcements are there okay Heavenly Father we thank you Lord Jesus for your grace and love unto us thank you for the day that we have the time father to be able to set aside that we can take a little time and fellowship together around thy word and Lord we we just thank you for you because without you what would there wouldn't be anything of us anyway but we thank you and just have your way now as we try to speak about you you come and be in our hearts and our lives and just Lord we love you and we thank you guide us now and keep us in Jesus name amen Matthew 19 verse three the Pharisees also came unto him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife forever cause and he answered and said unto them have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twne shall be one flesh wherefore there are no more twine but one flesh what therefore God ha joined together let no man put us under they say unto them to him why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement and to put her away he said say unto them Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so now that is in no way referencing that just because their hearts got hardened that everybody could just do everything right he explains it in the next verse it has no reference that that just because of the hardness of your hearts you know y'all wanteded it you got it remember brother random said he gave it to Moses and counted it righteousness so that's not just because they wanted it that they got it and it was okay for everything that's the one point I'm driving down hard in this series on this in verse 9 says and I say unto you who whoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another committ adulterine whosoever Marth her which is put away doth commit adultery he explained it you may be seated right there in the bases of saying and giving you the only grounds that you can cover it on and we won't get to there this afternoon thought we would but we got tied up a little bit this morning speaking of the two Covenants and uh I hope you'll go home and think about these things that as I said in that that this is not the two covenants that was made over it with uh Paul speaking you know and and saying there in the scriptures you know that one was made with Mount Si and the other one was made with Jerusalem which is above and all it that's not the Covenant there right it was the Covenant that was made play with Adam and Eve in the garden and and the things and I want to review that a good bit and then pick up our thought from where we were and continue on now brother R said because of the Fall there had to be another covenant made there was only one Covenant to begin with you remember that this morning paragraph 101 marriage and divorce co-equal with him but she lost her co-equal with man right and thereby they wound up being two covenants all right the Covenant with the product and the Covenant with the byproduct all right now two covenants as I said now this Covenant that he's speaking of I do not believe that that's speaking of salvation in the bases of the new birth and stuff like that all right I tried to emphasize that this morning because it it's not that your marital situation is not going to send you to hell it will if you don't do something about it or you let that yourself let that be a hindrance you can do it it's the cause of the Fall it's a problem that made us the way we are and all like that but we're not at standing like Adam and Eve again right we're standing on free moral agency that's right of the right to accept or reject it's not Adam's fault that we're in the trouble we're in it's our fault we can't blame him for what was going on but then he made two covenants one with the male and one with the female now as I said if that was talking about salvation you know want talking about the New Birth salvation eternal life Etc then you would be dealing with uh the basis of life or death but Adam and Eve wasn't dealing with the the fact Adam was just as Dead when he walked out of the garden as Eve was amen now whatever death you put her you better put him CU I emphasized it over and over I have in this the Bible says in Adam all die right right all right he had the right to put her away and God would have killed her and started again all right but we know he didn't and that would be the point of bringing forth his attributes and the things and we know that Adam loved his wife but now remember there was only when they were Adam and Eve there was one Covenant right all right now you agree okay one Covenant now I want scripture and I want to know what that Covenant is you understand me he made one Covenant yep he made that with Adam yep while he was still you know Eve was in Adam naturally when Eve was taken from Adam she would be under that one Covenant right because it would be co-equal are you listening now yes if they're co-equal then whatever Covenant Adam has she has a covenant Now what is that Covenant brother around and said every time God made a covenant said man broke it you agree you need about 400 quotes on that when I get maybe 150 I'm just serious I want you to think what was that Covenant jot it down on a piece of paper and see if your answer is correct what you think about it and I don't do it to be trickery I do it to get you to think because I said this morning Satan is here today doing exactly like he was doing in the garden he's right here in this congregation right here in your minds in my mind doing exactly what he was doing in the garden that's why Paul said that he was the scared less through his subtility see that he would deceive us about the Simplicity of Jesus Christ all right we can look at and we can see the doctrines of the message and see that they're not seeing the Simplicity of Christ if it was they wouldn't bring those doctrines we can see those doctrines going forth and thank God for showing us those doctrines that are wrong that's right and and we wouldn't agree with them but I'm talking to Lula Georgia today anybody else listening is up to them uh I don't Pastor the internet but what is that Covenant that was made with Adam if it was then it was made with Eve as I said then the prophet would say he said God basically made three covenants one with Adam let's see now may get this wrong but if I hope I'm right one with Noah and another with Abraham you remember Abraham came became unconditional Abraham was under the conditional Covenant that was brought forth and the problems until God made another Covenant a New Covenant with Abraham right you remember he put him to sleep he made it unconditional Etc and all but now on that basis what do you think about the Covenant that was made with Adam see if we can read what the prophet said that's why I love to do that then I don't have to wonder what is your input meaning what do you think about this well my thoughts are just as good as your thoughts and that's true probably sometime a whole lot better but what does the word say that's that's the difference in it right that's right all right now if we can read something from the prophet maybe we'll understand this Covenant so go ahead brother Anderson and pill up 4 a I laid these on the desk in there and there's all scribbled up so if they get to Jumping don't worry about it they'll find me preached in 1965 for 25 brother around preached a message called God's provided place of worship paragraph 29 said he had a covenant with Adam the first man on the earth and that Covenant was on conditions if you do so and so I'll do so and so what's now Adam would had something to do in order to keep this Covenant alive before God now you are you listening yes so Adam is put in the garden uncondition right he would have something to do y with this doing why because it's conditions what's condition if you do I'll do if you don't I don't right all right now watching what did he have to do Adam would had something to do in order to keep this commandment alive before God what would that be he had to walk in God's ways keeping all of his word not breaking one word all right now so it's it's an UNC it's a conditional Covenant that started with Adam the unconditional Covenant started with Abraham all right what was that Covenant where's the scpt scriptures go ahead with number 4B taking from Abraham and his seed after him 1961 423 which would be paragraph e19 now when he made a covenant with Adam if you will not touch that tree you'll live forever and there's his Covenant right what did you write down is the Covenant part of your thought if you'll not touch that tree that's the only thing that was said to Adam show me anywhere in the Bible now all he said to Adam was you don't touch that tree y all he had to do just not touch that tree he could eat of every tree that was in the garden is that according to Genesis brother R said then thereby he could even eat of the tree of life you know we know the tree of life is Jesus Christ the word So Adam could eat of that tree he was just told not to eat of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil there's the covenant What is the Covenant brother random if you will not touch that tree you'll live forever Adam broke it Moses and them if you'll keep the Commandments I'll do so and so I'll you know if you break the Covenant I'll do so and so God makes a covenant with man man breaks his Covenant with God but the Covenant was Genesis what 3:17 I believe it is where he says you don't partake of that tree of knowledge of Good and Evil all right I didn't give him this one but it's taken from the message he swore by himself preached in 1954 1212 God told told Adam if you'll touch this tree you you eat from here and you'll live you eat from th that one you'll die that's the Covenant now that's if you got the thing before you if you do this if you do that you'll die you'll live there eat this one you'll live eat that eat from this one he died so what is the Covenant that was made then with Abraham I mean Adam don't eat of that tree that was transmitted to Eve right her being co-equal so when she came into being then it would be the same Covenant for her and for him don't eat of the tree brother Bram said and you've got it and you heard it you heard him say said that that was just one word he said in the garden he said just one word what's he saying just one word one point don't eat of that tree cu the day you eat thereof that day you'll die you can eat every tree out here you can even eat of the Tree of Life brother said the tree of life was in the garden to remind Adam that his youth was being renewed because his body was not Eternal so now there's your covenant made with Adam but then a fall came as we read this morning and at that point she was co-equal but once she fell that another Covenant was made she was no longer ruler with him each must have a separate Covenant paragraph 194 we'll read that in just a moment again to start coequal with him being in that high form brother Brown says paragraph 101 marriage and divorce how could she do such a thing being in that high form she was right with man co-equal with him she lost her co-equal with man when she sinned and God said man will be your ruler from your own out now got a covenant then for the product and a covenant for the byproduct have you caught on a little of what I'm talking about from this morning if we don't believe it was a covenant of Salvation you know the woman with one way of getting saved and another man with another way would that be a good one for people of this message has got their two Lords and two souls and all kind of can't you just see them well Adam's saved by one way man's sa woman she's saved by another way you know and be a good Doctrine I guess wouldn't it but now listen if there needs to be another Covenant what kind of a covenant is it he said that's where I had to stop because of another hour here okay if the Covenant with Adam and Eve was one Covenant do not to partake of the tree of life I mean tree of knowledge of Good and Evil right all right now when Adam is under one Covenant Eve is under another Covenant right you remember I gave you a couple of quotes this morning where brother brandom even refers to it where it would go into marriage and divorce but he's talking about the Covenant that a woman is not supposed to cut her high and that the man is supposed to cut his right makes a double Covenant and in doing that then you're going to see naturally I hope that what happened was and I pray God give me the right words to use on this I wrote it like this before we start I want you to think on this point this is not two covenants spoken of Paul and Galatians 4 this is not two Covenants for salvation there's only one way of Salvation these two covenants deal with a man and the woman after the fall now you following me so it will be dealing with how they live and involved with your life on Earth because there's only one Covenant with God and when this is all finished and we get into heaven there won't be two covenants in heaven right you agree right there W be two covenants there only be one Covenant in heaven all right now now so we better deal with not talk about salvation but looking ourselves why we here on Earth the man has God deals with him one way I'm talking about physically now I'm not talking about his salvation all right everybody understand me God deals with a man one way and heal deals with a woman another way by dealing in those two matters it makes two covenants and you say well it's silly what you brought out well your Prophet is one that brought it out so I guess you're calling him silly that the Bible speaks of a man not to have long hair and a woman to have long hair right speaks of a man to work tant and things a woman to dresses and the prophet says that even means in your marriage and divorce case all right that's paragraph 306 are then the evening messenger I read it this morning 63 uh 115 no excuse me 11868 let's give a glis 1 one a pretty good six I'm 723 now so that's what I told Brother Richard Wilson this morning I said you was out running me for a little while his birthday is in February and he was 73 and I said No 7 he was 74 in February and I said I was two years behind you but all at once in April I caught up a whole year now he's only one year you're older but now listen so then it has to be that the Covenant form that is being spoken of and not being salvation and not being those things it would mean your manner of life you're living how you live and why things are like they are see not looking for a Salvation Covenant but looking to a point of the end time now why would it be that the new birth would not wipe out everything cuz that's what people think when I got to New Birth that took care of everything well the whole Bible was full of it and you know took a long time and the prophet finally preached on marriage and divorce why in the world he preach on marriage and divorce and and say I say unto you and Paul said it and Moses it was all tied up in the New Birth just one say you get born again you took care of everything your new birth takes care of the sin in the soul right that's right that's why there's not no two covenants in the garden from Adam and Eve in the soul part it's both identically the same it's the new birth amen but then we deal with fleshly speaking and by doing that by knowing and realizing that we're not going to get as I ended up this morning talking if we were if we're going to get a new body then we don't have to worry about marriage and divorce right you agree but it wouldn't have any connections to us but if it does have connections to us we better listen well brother I just don't understand it brother randam said it and and I believe it's all right well okay but I asked the question this morning read from the prophet saying that it had to be revealed to you amen some of you were sitting there maybe young and on up a little age and all different ones but some of you a good many were there I'm looking at maybe 1 2 3 4 four at least it was sitting there when he preached marriage and divorce but I still got to say to you if that wasn't revealed to you then it's just words right and you can't take as I said this morning this message to the people of the world you start talking to somebody and they start saying well you know I've been married two or three times we got the way for you straighten that out if you just come up Lula please please don't do that CU we don't have no way to work it out that's right all you do is just come in and sit down with a bunch of people that's got the same problem does that work it out out no but we can find out what God says right he has the way to work it out but that'll be a revelation amen not just words that you say okay sorry to be like I am but I got to preach it straight it don't matter who it hits or what it covers I got to go down the line he said well brother D you don't believe that the it's the same Covenant to live by you know the man and the woman to live by you don't believe we have the same Covenant to live by no cuz that's the problem that's right now now the one thing I'm saying we all need to live and do good that all right but because of the woman partaking of the tree of life I mean tree of knowledge of Good and Evil see it throwed the problem on her side right I'm laying this down for Wednesday but it laid the problem on her side and and for being on her side that's the problem right you got to deal with it one way the man has to deal with it another way I love questions so I ask you another one how come the sin offering was an animal you agree God killed the animals then they had to offer the why because the animal was the instigator or the natural material used or whatever you want to call it to bring about Sin right so it would be natur natur to use an animal to bring an atonement now I'm quoting brother random paraphrase maybe but still close enough so then we've got to deal with something about this flesh man right you know all right then we we look and we see that naturally women are supposed to be women yep the men are supposed to be men that's the situation brother Brandon said when you see them Crossing up you see it messing up right course we all want to scream and holler to preachers in this message about the women to leave and say is your wife worthy of the Gospel you know not your life worthy I've heard preachers say back good many years ago you know especially one brother was bad and said we get the women lined up we' be ready to go well if that's true we'll just have a line after service right down through the middle of the church and we'll put the men on each side and the women in the middle and all the men will take a whip and they'll just beat them into place you said you're silly no that's what they're saying they're not saying if we get ly up right come on you've listened enough preachers you already heard it right they can strut but always condemning the woman all right see now the covenants then the the the difference in the Covenant between the male and the female we'll deal with this just a minute then we'll leave it it says that she can't but he can right she can't marry again irregardless of what except the death of her husband that's right there is no grounds nowhere in the Bible for a woman to divorce a man right we will get to that Wednesday just hitting a little but it's not said for him no you got two covenants are you following it amen you got two covenants one with him one with her now I put it up front don't mind doing it anytime I love to you said well a man can just put his wife away for just anything they ain't no Bible for that and they ain't no prophet's message for that quote bring it to me I want to see it because there's only one in the scripture right except it be for fornication but Brother D I got where brother Brown said you can put your wife away it's 50 something times and you can put your wife away for cutting her hair but there's one in there you better make sure you put with it we'll get it Wednesday night he said but he can't marry again for that reason you see you can't make the Bible nor the prophet fight each other you know they can't do it it has to come together as a layout well then how are you going to deal with it when you get there brother Dale I might want to leave it alone let you think about it but I don't like to leave you dangling too bad for a woman to cut her hair is unclean living okay unclean living for you to cut your high sister what about us men all the things but uh we'll get up to their Wednesday cuz I sure ain't got four hours this evening I want to eat some more of that cake and ice cream but now think about it two covenants and it's dealing with your life on Earth I want to emphasize that over and over and over where you'll get it it's not dealing with your salvation you know it is the products of the natural flesh that we have have to deal with she's given a covenant he's given a covenant for the way we live but we got to be very narrow on coming down to it because I said then you just can't put your wife away for any cause or every cause the Bible tells you the only way you can yep right all right the prophet surely is not contrary to the Bible wouldn't I wouldn't believe would you right but now we found this morning 325 of the future home paragraph 325 of the future home that he did not curse Adam and he did not curse Eve so now if you going to say well Adam's a good guy you know but Eve is a bad person and she's cursed well I brother Ram said she wasn't now so you're going to have to talk to him I'm sorry I found that quote but you see if it's not a curse Adam or a cur Eve situation you know in other words if it's not a death I'm sure they probably got that up now where you can read it if it's not a death situation but I will remind you in the Old Testament while a lot of these things was going on it was a lot of trouble right Adam could have but didn't it know comes over to Lage 4 or something in Genesis or you come into the polygamy situation with the two man with the two wi his first name was or his name was Layman so it wasn't even the garden with too many wives right she's the one that had too many husbands all right but now when the polygamy came into being a man could have more than one wife and everything was wonderful but what if the woman had more than one husband right y with no playgrounds or no titty tattering there death so now what kind of a covenant you want to put under see I'm just trying to make you and I come to a realization that we don't know most of the time what we're talking about did that hit home they go over your head you show it back what do you think we've been around here 40 something years for amen right I think that self EXP the door don't you but now listen if God could break the opening of the seals to you and I and by that opening of the seals to you and I bring to us a revelation of marriage and divorce don't you think that would be where it would come from and we can see it and follow it right through the word amen and have the ability to walk off this Earth as Free People brother Dale what are you talking about in plain language if this man that you're looking at cannot be conquered by the man that's inside of him right I am gravebound right the Rapture is not an automatic process of out run out time running out right I thought your Prophet said page 14 I believe it is of the Rapture he said the Rapture is a revelation amen right on in there somewhere he says a bride will be waiting for the revelation of the Rapture that's right amen so it's dealing with Revelation not intellect amen that's right not words on a page that's right right yes so now sorry to do it but let's back up let's go over over brother uhu I think brother Bob's back there today brother Anderson out here they taking it time about now they're doing all right go over to paragraph 194 and let's start we'll start on number eight and this is going to be a long reading he's preached 1965 221 the morning service marriage and divorce one paragraph 194 through about 2002 or three now notice now after the beginning after the beginning After Time begin back in that was eternity it was over back in that was eternity it over notice after that fall was made by Eve after the fall there was need to be another Covenant made now this is going to stumble you a little but I'm going to give you the scripture to prove that this is the truth now notice after the fall Jesus said God at the beginning made one of a kind but now after the fall now we're going beyond that the Covenant was co-equal but now after the fall there is another covenant made now she was no longer a ruler with him you reading each must have a separate covenant What did the put her he shall rule over thee right why because of her the way she done he said let's see if this is right let's go to Genesis 3 all right the Lord said unto the serpent now he's going to curse it the serpent right because thou Hast done this Thou Art cursed above all the cattle above every beast of the field and upon thy belly Thou shalt go and th shal thou eat all the days of thy life that's him I love it was it's injected right he ain't going to throw even Even Adam ain't cursed right if they was cursed you'd have to pull that scripture out right are you spiritual enough to understand what I'm saying if they was cursed to death in a point of Eternity or something they was cursed to death in the natural and to have rules and regulations of of earth right I put IM between thy seed between thee and the woman between thy seed and the woman's seed it shall bruise thy head and th shall bruise his heel the promising coming through the woman the Messiah to redeem now look now there is the Covenant with the serpent which they were all right beforehand was nothing wrong with a serpent at the beginning are before the beginning the serpent was okay right until he was used all right now so then he comes down to Adam he turns and unto the woman I will greatly multiply thy sorrows and thy conception and the sorrow shall thou bring forth children and th Desir shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee no more co-equal together at all now she has turned right around and she's the ruler now he'll rule over thee one Covenant he'll rule over thee sorrow and things will be her problem y right y because she's no more coequal then he turns to Adam because thou has hearkened to the voice of thy wife and has eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee saying Thou shalt not eat it cursed be the ground not cursed Adam cursed be the ground for thy sake there's no Eternal separations involved in that curse right but there is physical covenants to be made right I keep emphasizing that because that's what the Lord showed me the other day when he was fishing and riding up down the road and doing you see sometimes I I do that and it just clears your mind enough to get you to thinking and then I begin to think and I Lord I got to answer this question somebody's going to ask it and what's your answer why did Eve do like she done Lord was she made some kind of a horrible thing he says no she was made a freeo agent she Choice her choice took her that away what's the covenants the Covenant is with Eve that she's going to Bear children showing what the physical happening of the thing and eating instead of eating an apple if it' been eating an apple it said Eve's going to have bellyaches no it didn't say that it said your curse will be upon your wound and brother around and said said not by not do I mean by doing that Jesus had to come by the wom right that's another quote but it's all right but Adam you went with this thing on so y but your curse is that you're going to be working for a living we'll get to it in a minute and uh when I was in the Baptist Church the old Deacon we were sitting there in the deacons meeting one night and we were talking about you know having too many wives and this one old Deacon he says that's where I just don't believe in that old polygamy course he was senior Deacon nobody didn't correct him we just all sniggered yeah that's not exactly the way it's pronounced but you know what you think about Adam now you eat of the ground it commanded this the ground is going to bring forth the sorrow you're going to do this and you're going to return to the dust where you come from you're going all these things going to happen to you atam and said after it runs a little while I'm going to make it even harder on you yeah because you're going to wind up with more than one wife and you going to have to have two jobs poor old David 700 Solomon a thousand I don't need to say anymore that's right I remember an old movie years ago I was seeing way back there was a in Africa and this old chief of the tribe you know they had you know they believed in polygamy there and the guy answered asked the chief said Chief said I notice said y'all believe in polygamy don't you and he said yeah yeah said but I notice said you don't have but one wife said why is that true he said my wife don't like that idea so I think that's a good point all right but now not cursed Adam not cursed Eve just conditions right now I'm trying to get that word into you to think about what I'm saying two covenants yep not about salvations right but about life and living and doing now I'm facing a more horrible point to explain when I get to it a little further down the road but yet in the New Testament there's no such thing as polygamy is it one about Christ and the church well what about it she might all to wait till I get there and I hope it time I get there I'll have the right answer got part of it right all right and it'll work we get on that other side it's not going to be David with a th000 wives or 700 we get on the other side because if it is you'd have you fall still in existence all right let's go to paragraph 198 and roll that up let's read two covenants now that closes the beginning of what Jesus said it wasn't so in the beginning we got another Covenant now notice it's another Covenant now there's a covenant for the product and a covenant for the byproduct now notice to fall brought trouble death every creature of the creation making a difference in all nature lock that in making a difference in nature cuz it makes a difference in the nature of the man the nature of the woman the nature of the dog the nature of the female the male but from the beginning it wasn't so now it is not so from it is now it is after the beginning now there's a double Covenant first it was just a covenant Adam and Eve was co-equal one man and one woman now the woman sinned and what does she do that drove them all to death and God had to make a covenant by that another Covenant here it is right here here in Genesis 3:16 now we just read Genesis 3:16 about 13- 16 of what it was said to Eve and her Covenant he'll rule over thee your desire to be to him but to Adam just Adam you going to have to work not going to curse neither one of you to death and going just put you under a situation of life and you're going to live that way first it was a covenant Adam and Eve was co-equal one man one woman now the woman sinned and what does she do that drove them all to death and God had to make a covenant by that another Covenant here it is right here in Genesis 3:16 he made another Covenant okay read Genesis 3:16 again the world is to be repopulated not by the original creation of God like in the beginning not by the original creation but by sex desire now follow now that takes care of the beginning doesn't it in the beginning there was one only one man and one woman one male and one female but when she crossed that line and brought this sin now the world is to be repopulated again by sex not by creation by sex see where the woman is at now now but that's the way the world is populated today through women right that's the reason Jesus had to come through the woman to bring it back to the original beginning exactly right without sex desire all right roll it on up a little now you see then after the beginning it was something else was introduced then when the double Covenant was made by man and woman through SE another Covenant all together not the original Covenant but another Covenant now brings what introduc now now what's introduced polygamy in all after the beginning P was introduced both in man and in Beast after the beginning to fall secondarily it it's a new nature Again by Sex God created the first without sex do you believe that congregation says amen that's another Covenant with nature but you're supposed to be women what we men are supposed to be he sets it in another order by next second Covenant one male many females now if you'll notice he's dealing with the Covenant with the woman bringing her under the position of subjection then you got a covenant two of them one with a man that he can have more than one wife if he does it correctly we'll get to that later not to just anything or happening what it's got to be correct he's supposed to marry a virgin number one or as I said this morning about David and Abigail David you know her husband was dead right that made it legal for David to marry her we get into the preachers about those things and it's not even illegal that way for them but we'll try to hold off now you got polygamy involved now I ask you another question uh if polygamy means for male or female which some of you probably looked up in your Websters and you found out it does apply but if polygamy is okay for male and female look what a trouble you got well then polygamy is not legal for the female I said while too David have a thousand wies but one of them women she has another husband her Co throats get cut she's dead because that ain't the Covenant under the double Covenant it was not made that they would be standing there as okay for the woman okay for the man uh-uh only okay for the man he said brother Dale I looked up polygamy I'm glad you did because you'll come to realization of wording then go ahead and pull it up brother on polygamy is from Wikipedia polygamy is a late Greek word meaning many married that's what it means many married one it's a it's a marriage which includes more than two partners so you'd say well not for either one now I said while ago I've got the Bible what do you got you got his definitions and their answers but I got the Bible polygamy in the Old Testament was legal for the man right there was no legality in the Old Testament for the woman to have more than one husband give me scripture probably a lot of them did have but I'm not saying that now well it could be for one okay well let's see what it is so now we'll just break it down we'll let these old boys break it when a man is married to more than one wife at a time the relationship is called p l y g y n y you want to call that polygamy or you want to call it polygamy or what do you want to call it I don't know how to pronounce it I know how to spell it but watch in that form of relationship of more than one wife they even say and there is no marriage bond between the wives right no marriage bond see between the wives right well because every one of David's wife was his wife singular right right each one was his wife singular right we'll get back to more on it Sunday around said he could have more than one wife but said there's no way she could have more than one husband right no way and see if you did do it there's no bond between the wives right you know in other words there not nothing con and when a woman is married to more than one husband at the time it is called p o l y a n d y probably Andrea Andrea or something and there is no bond between the husbands right see yeah if a marriage includes multiple husbands and wives yeah it can be called group marriage what they say that's a problem it goes into social and psychological social stff all right polygamy is the practice of a person's practice of a persons making him herself available for two or more spouses to make with see they still want to keep that idea of polygamy for either one but it does give you an explanation now this is what I like Monami money gam is a marriage considered of only two parties man right not to men right not to women amen two partners you know male and female yeah all right huh it says it's generally there because the term is often used no matter because whether it's recognized by the governance or not all [Music] right now monogamia is more or less singular right whereas polygamy is more or less plural all right see that's why we believe in one true and living God right monotheism yes sir is what one God worship of one God singular right all polytheism more than one God so I hope you're tying that together it's what I said I got the Bible whether you you think I'm what I'm crazy anyway that's all right but see we say well polygamy can be either way that's the words of terminologies but there was no way in the Old Testament for a woman to have more than one husband no that's right she was killed in a hurry and if you don't understand this and can't follow it correctly get away from your male chish Pig's idea what that words are for this modern day that you think the man is the honcho muncho all kind of this that and the other you know and he's degrading the wife the Bible doesn't do that the Bible places it in order right right gives the woman a place he wasn't made wrong he made beautiful Perfect Right placed in the garden what would it have been had she stayed where she was right you see but it messed it up down through the Old Testament a woman was just like a we called it the other day you know maybe a hamburger and compared with the Porter House steak is the man but they really thought of him a whole lot less than that because they were just you know anything y a lot of the foreign countries they don't want girls born they want boys right right they don't see it's involved in everything brought down to a point of seeing what it is that David could have more than one wife because of the Fall you say did God make lamage have two wives no but he was the first man that wound up with two wives did God decide after these things happened of the fall and the de generation of humanity that he would finally do something about it and he would do a certain way um I don't believe that way right I believe in him being almighty God that he knew before the world ever begun that if he placed Us in the garden with a free moral agency no matter how Hood Duty good we think we are if it had been you and me there we'd have failed just as much as Adam need probably a little quicker so then it's not crowing for anybody it's finding the truth right so because of the Fall that Eve done it caused the fall then the sway went to her side to seeing that it was placed upon her the burden right right bearing children and things having more than one husband not being vulgar n comical brother Brown was the one that said it he said David had 700 wives he said he had over a 100 children in one year right so you know a lot of his wives never saw him after they got married the first night right but you know if she' went out and had her another husband she was dead so there is a Sor to you sisters right do you see the polygamy and what I'm talking about yes they have a wedding day and he probably sees her no more for a year she has to live that year and what if she didn't get pregnant she left a year without it you know but then if she did get pregnant she got one year taking care of a child and you know just being natural just talking try to be sensible the sorrow is th sisters and it placed upon you because of what you done right there's no greater Jewel David who was it David or Solomon said that a bad woman was like Watering your blood to kill you he said but there's no greater thing and Prophet would say that there's no greater thing that God could give you outside of Salvation as a good wife that's right right amen a good wife see that can become one with you amen you see make that bond with you and raise children and have a happy time together amen there is no polygamy in the New Testament all right got a lot of scriptures wrote down for Wednesday don't want to try to get to it now but because of you and what you're doing sisters he said I didn't do it no but it's still being done because of the Fall it fell because of your gr your your people just like I said the animals why did it be that the animals would wind up and be under you know be used as an animal sacrifice because the animal was used to be the fall the natural thing of the Beast is God unrighteous for doing those things like that or is he righteous in that he would find a sacrifice which way do you think he's unrighteous to take the life of an animal I like what Rabbi Richmond I believe it was said that time he said when you think about the animal laying on the altar he said you don't think of how horrible it is to kill the animal said but you think of how wonderful and gracious God has accepted the animal for you changes the death doesn't it to think of how that it can take away your doing all right but I want to go to one thing before we get back into Wednesdays and I'll try to explain something right here remember in the garden the first thing was the problem with Eve in her mind right right then the natural act took place Paul said that he was a scared that Satan through his subtility would be able to what right now in Lula Georgia see 2013 would be able to penetrate your mind deceive you and turn you away from the Simplicity that is in Christ see Satan's right here now more than ever before talking and deceiving us so you see what happened in the garden now Heaven Help me what happened in the garden was God allowing Satan to be able to do the way he done right are you following me he didn't make him do it but he permitted him to do it he allowed it to come into being amen because of our free agency in what he knew that's right remember there was a battle in heaven before it ever come to Earth earth right sin didn't originate as your that what your Prophet said it didn't originate on Earth it originated in heaven [Music] right see God permitted that sin of Heaven to drop down upon Earth and start perverting now if I didn't believe it that way I would have drastic trouble with believing in polygamy and the animal kingdom I can understand the point of polygamy into the human Kingdom because of her Fallen condition it made her into one condition under one Covenant that she could never have but to one husband it made him to where he could have more than one wife but do you understand about the animals do you think the animals were standing looking to see what Humanity done and then they just followed after it I don't go that way right that's why this got to be one day an eternal Holy Fire to come down on this Earth to cleanse everything and cleanse every demon cleanse every germ and destroy it every bit right right it's got to be thank God Amen because what happened when man sinned it not only brought the polygamy in the human race that same Spirit right that caused to fall in the beginning with man and woman and brought polygamy into being that same Spirit was released upon the human being you say scripture brother T the serpent was the most sub to the long Beast right right the serpent did have a relationship with Eve the Beast right there because of that penetrating of her mind by Satan and the releasing of those demons that bombarded her continually what is it now that bombards our minds that's right that's and it was bad enough about 1948 somewhere in there brother brandham covers where there was 200,000,000 demons that was under Hitler and Ian and them to drive the Jews to the Homeland he said was released not on the Jews on the bride that's right am I right right Amen to drive you and I to the word of the hour right cuz there's no hopes outside of it so you see the answer to why did the animals fall into the polygamy because there was a spirit released a spirit of polygamy a spirit of one buck and many do but that old Buck he's fighting all the time to keep off them little Young Bucks and them old bucks away from his herd right you know what gets trophy deer killed yeah trophy do like guess pretty good work big old do that are looking for not just one looking for anyone they can find that's right right see polygamy is a spirit folks adultery is a spirit fornication is a spirit now back in the early 20s and 30s women's dress used to be real short ever seen the pictures of them you don't know that was no no you better go on back right before the depression go back and look their dresses had started coming up drastically but when the Depression hit see that was a spirit among the women then the Depression hit dresses went down right cuz they wanted to straighten up and get right because it's hungry and they needed something they needed but then shortly after the Depression things started going up you know what went up girls dresses women's dresses started going up all these things we talk about is Spirits amen demons that's loose on the bride where did all these preachers get all these ideas from and the doctrines when a lot of them ain't even sensible right right I mean ain't even sensible you got two Lords you got to have two Gods you have a God for each soul I don't have no education I got that much sense Spirits hovering among people right back there when the the two Soul Doctrine started coming out people would say I've been waiting on this all my life I knew there was something about the soul and this is what I've been waiting on and the author of it went to bed with a bunch of young girls but you know today they still don't believe that happened Spirits you know that communism is a spirit right what's American Spirit Frolic happy Sports uh entertainment entertainment y ENT brother Keith Reed told us about when they the Russians took over that you know they bought out the place there in Jamaica the the boxy which is aluminum you know boxy and uh when they took it over to see the difference in the spirit of it was the Jamaican people you know could just in other words brother Reed had a right to go out if he needed something he was a supervisor you know high rank supervisor he could go out and just buy what he had the need of you know and they just bring it to him when the Russians took over you know what he said happened he said if they needed a little wrench a little small item said the first thing the man says what do you need it for you had to explain in detail what you need it for can you do without it no no we can't I'll have to make a contact I'm trying to show you a spirit he' go call Russia to someone with higher rank than him because he brother Reed one day said well why don't y'all just do this that and the other we get it done in a hurry the man says we can't make decisions they have to be cleared by the hire up yeah to make a minor decision that brother Reed used to just sign off himself you know the paperwork that they needed to buy a few things it's a spirit every government is a spirit look at all of these things today look at the spirits of the land today what is the spirit Now kill get a name for yourself you go down in glory you're going to heaven now for killing a bunch of people and you're going to get 70 virgins but I never did read what the girl gets when she died I guess it's 70 men I never did know that never could find that answer that's a spirit right and like my wife said the other day about it we were talking some of us right down the road she said if somebody come along to me and said well hey you know you need to go out here and strap this bomb on you and blow them up so she'd say you put the bomb on I'll follow you that ends the discussion don't it cuz them guys is telling you how to do it are not the ones getting blowed up but how dumb you can be but a spirit let's go a little closer the Bible said in the last days there would be a spirit among the people released that they'd kill you thinking they're doing God a service is that scripture is that's what happening out there now they think it's doing their God of service by destroying you Spirits I hope that's caught on what I'm what my point was reading to bring it why that there was polygamy in the animal kingdom because once that spirit was released upon mankind it goes out onto everything when it went out on everything it went right into that female Kingdom of the animals and like I told you a boy bear mate with a female few months after she has the baby he'll go and kill his own baby his own offspring that he's brought forth by her to try to bring her into receptiveness you think that is it's a spirit not all of them don't do it just certain ones we here in the South they're familiar with squirrels you know that a boy squirrel a boy squirrel an old one will crawl in the nest of the babies that he has brought forth by the female and he will neuter them because he don't want no competition Spirits where do those animals get those ideas that's my point polygamy and the animals they get their idea from Spirits that are released cuz that's the same thing that happened to man yeah so you get over to the fourth chapter read your Bible you get over fourth chapter before you're dealing with anybody that's got two wives and then I don't even know where that that anywhere after then um if you went scripturally you would go to Abraham and Abraham and Sarah and the things I'm sure there was many more before then because it had said it there in Genesis that the sons of God saw the daughters of men and it took unto them wives the original says women the original translation says women so there was polygamy already getting started you think Spirits don't bother you if they don't bother you pray for me why because they're here to pull us away from the word and why is it that a man will start preaching it's like the two soul man I had contact with him in his beginning and even read the book they put out where he said I don't believe in doing this and I never will have more than one wife of course he didn't he just started dealing with young girls and would you like for young your little young daughters for some jack lag preacher standing up pull pit to take your young kids and force them to marry into somebody else you said oh that's not in the message you need to get out a little bit right around yeah right what does it mean to would it make you happy cuz one of your little young girls would marry some old 70y old man Spirits are real those animals just fell under those Spirits right right what about it let's stand double Covenant bringing about polygamy polygamy is used under the Old Testament form to type Christ in the church we'll pick it up Wednesday when you come to Christ in the church you're back to where it didn't say to uh Joseph go get you another wife said go take your wife and how are you going to bring it together in Paul as his sayings that we become one how are you going to tie it together with Genesis that the two becomes one well listen know here are just many multiple things well that wouldn't in the garden where are we going what do you think about it you see folks in the old Bible times there was a lot of other things when a son would prophesy AE his daddy would just take him out and Mama and they'd kill him right that Bible New Testament they make him a preacher in the message he make he got a big following too old I'm sorry maybe I'm just too old an Old Goat but I'm still just I didn't have those doctrines when I was young the first time I preached marriage and divorce was probably about 1970 I would have been 30 years old then and I preach just like I'm doing right now why because I know what Satan is doing I know his strength of what he's doing and how he tries to Captivate your mind see all he's got to do is just get you to think that brother Dale's got something against you that's all it takes and see then he'll keep pulling that train on you until he build it a big case I told you about brother Mo and I'd be riding down the road he'd be talking about the word something would tell me he said why don't you just drive off the road on his side of the car and run into a tree said you'll shed him up brother h well that was what happened see one of them I know it let's just sing and worship and think about it all right then we go eat some more ice cream and cake right okay go ahead of I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of the one of the one of I'm soad I can say one of these people may not learn to be our B of worldly they have all received their P baptized in Jesus name and are telling Now power I'm so glad [Music] you know I'm one of them that just believe I'm one of them that believe

CLS to [Music] have I'm soad [Music] pray for these sisters that are living alone because you know how Satan does Satan will see those things and he'll try to bring it around and make some man do something sister mil might not want me to say this but a man came to her house and stood in the backyard of her home and they had to call the police they to get him out of there well like I said sometimes people you know they know that these are unmarried women or whatever and you know I'm sorry for being just but just as honest as I can be we put prior Clause given to her to put over the windows over the doors and all the house and everything else but I told her I see get you a good baseball bat amen get you a can of Maze and like my wife told her said the better than the maze is to go down to the hardware store and buy you a can of fly spray was and you know that sprays about 20 ft you said well we trust the yes sir we trust the Lord and I believe it and I'm not saying if he don't show up we do other things I'm not saying I'm just saying when not with be sensible I'm not going to stand by and some man break into my home and me say I'm a Christian I wouldn't want you to do that you may not like it but he might meet more than he wants if nothing else get you something that sounds like a shotgun when it goes and a little red dot that'll stick on him when he walks in the door and you won't have to worry about the old boy I'm just honest I'm sorry that's right you say that's one of my faults my pastor Scott all right I'm just that way I'm sorry but I I I try to be right and I don't want to do it I like I told my brother he said you'd kill a man as well as a deer I said no there's difference than that but I said there's one thing about it it's different than me and you I said if you shot somebody I said somebody breaking in my home i' chewed him and I said I just pray for his soul I wouldn't want him to be lost but you see we're living in a horrible time there'll be a day come when we can't protect ourselves upon a lot of basis and all we're not talking about because the law comes to your house and knocks on the door you shoot them I'm not talking about that I'm not stupid I'm talking about somebody trying to break in your home somebody trying to do wrong to you you can call the law you may take them a little while to get there entertain them while they're [Laughter] coming and what I mean by that is this happened years ago I remember I say it qu I remember the story come out of the tennesses that these people had escaped out of prison and they came to this old lady's house and you know they they wanted something to eat and you know things and she said come on in and said I feed you said shut your gun down outside said just leave them out of the house now we don't have no problems you know what they all just come on in the house and duck their guns outside we know it wasn't long till they just walk back down and turned herself in cuz she turned out to be a good Christian lady you know but she meant it she said these things are not allowed in my home but spirits in the land today look at them everywhere horrible forgive me for
