[0:00] yeah you get another one for that all
[0:02] right let's turn
[0:03] to my mom
[0:07] john 1. good to see everybody this
[0:09] morning
[0:11] good to have everybody here alive and
[0:14] well amen

[0:20] okay we are on
[0:26] john 1. gonna be in the house
[0:41] he got back
[0:50] i'm not worried about that before this
[0:53] morning we're gonna
[0:54] see this little visitor we got here on
[0:56] the internet that's my grandbaby
[0:59] wife wave to everybody thank you baby
[1:17] john not the little john thank john
[1:33] okay
[1:38] john 1-1
[1:47] all right now we're on the uh
[1:54] showing the dispensation of the son of
[1:56] god
[1:58] to the son of man and this in john it
[2:00] really
[2:02] chapter 1 verse 1 through verse 14
[2:06] is showing the whole account of
[2:11] god's condescending
[2:14] just like i was telling the the brothers
[2:17] and sisters in tennessee
[2:18] this weekend this is not
[2:22] done for god's benefit this is done for
[2:25] our benefit
[2:27] god never changed he always was jesus
[2:30] christ he always was god he always was
[2:32] elohim
[2:33] he always was all these things he always
[2:36] was
[2:37] a human being he never was of just a
[2:41] blob of light
[2:42] no we saw him evolve from a light coming
[2:46] out and god saying let there be light
[2:49] and that was the christ well christ is
[2:51] not a separate person from god
[2:53] it's just god in another form just like
[2:56] your god in another form
[2:58] all right so it's god in another form
[3:02] so that we can understand him nothing he
[3:05] has to understand but he wants us to
[3:08] understand him
[3:09] and him being so great and so mighty and
[3:11] so
[3:13] um my thoughts are greater than your
[3:14] thoughts my ways are not your ways and
[3:16] all those things he wrote in the bible
[3:18] but yet
[3:19] he comes down to john and he comes down
[3:21] to paul and paul says
[3:24] you've got to have that mind you must
[3:27] have the mind of christ
[3:28] all right if you have the mind of christ
[3:30] and that puts you before the foundation
[3:31] of the world
[3:32] your thoughts are now the thoughts of
[3:34] god
[3:36] god's thoughts are not your thoughts our
[3:38] thoughts are turned to god's thoughts
[3:39] right because adam
[3:42] she'd pay more attention y'all did hey
[3:46] baby
[3:47] i love you adam
[3:50] had the mind of god because he was pure
[3:54] but he was a human man in human flesh
[3:58] and was going to be the god of the earth
[4:02] that's the way god wanted it but sin
[4:05] came in the picture and god said
[4:07] okay you can't do it anymore adam
[4:09] because now we need a sacrifice you need
[4:11] something that i put this gap i can't
[4:14] come and see you anymore like we used to
[4:16] in the cool of the day
[4:19] you're not going to have the thoughts
[4:20] you used to have now your thoughts
[4:22] because remember
[4:23] he told him he said your desire will now
[4:26] be for what
[4:27] your wife see that wasn't adam's first
[4:30] desire
[4:31] or he would have already had a desire
[4:32] for eve
[4:34] brother brown said they had a holy ghost
[4:35] veil they were they were naked
[4:37] did not need any clothes there was no
[4:39] sexual connotation there was no
[4:42] there was nothing that adam had in his
[4:44] mind that was
[4:45] about eve in that relationship form
[4:50] as it developed we don't know what would
[4:51] have happened because it didn't
[4:53] but they were all born not born but they
[4:56] were all created
[4:58] to be in the image of god
[5:01] eve just as much as adam because she was
[5:04] a part of adam
[5:07] because you can't make her any less then
[5:09] that would make you and i less
[5:12] we're not bible says we're co-equal
[5:15] joint heirs heirs and joint errors all
[5:17] right with christ
[5:19] but we look in john and we see that
[5:22] i see the development of my new birth
[5:26] in all this that's what you must see
[5:28] it's not that god's this
[5:30] something way out here that we can't
[5:32] understand no he condescended so
[5:34] so low till the world didn't
[5:38] even know he was here he had to leave
[5:40] and come back
[5:41] in somebody to make him realize who he
[5:44] was
[5:45] same way with the the people in the old
[5:47] testament
[5:48] even paul paul said i see through a
[5:51] glass darkly or
[5:52] or i don't see all things but i see
[5:53] jesus he knew that jesus was the
[5:55] almighty god
[5:56] he had a revelation that that almighty
[5:59] god come to earth
[6:00] come on the day of pentecost went into
[6:02] the hearts of believers and paul had a
[6:04] part of that in his
[6:06] soul and he now said we must have the
[6:08] mind of christ
[6:09] because i believe paul went back in the
[6:11] old testament and he saw the
[6:12] condescending of god
[6:15] that's why he could write the new
[6:16] testament and say what that was a type
[6:19] of
[6:20] what did he say he said we held with our
[6:22] hands the king of glory
[6:24] in other words we felt him we touched
[6:26] him he was right here
[6:28] and we missed him now he's in the hearts
[6:30] of the believer
[6:31] giving us the mind of christ that's why
[6:32] we can read scripture
[6:34] that's why we can read the prophet's
[6:36] message and we can see god speaking to
[6:38] each one of us
[6:39] that's what we got to see now is it's
[6:41] not just that this great god
[6:43] how he came from from light and so great
[6:47] that
[6:47] nobody can understand him down to
[6:49] somebody that we could relate to
[6:53] you got to see that personally yourself
[6:55] right
[6:56] how that happened personally yourself a
[6:59] personal relationship with god
[7:02] this mighty creator
[7:05] because let's let's read here and then
[7:06] we're going to read our promise in john
[7:08] 14.
[7:11] you okay you should be quiet at church
[7:14] saint john 1 1. in the beginning was the
[7:18] logos
[7:20] what was the logos the speech the light
[7:22] what we were talking about
[7:24] i'm getting hot you don't have to excuse
[7:28] me just a minute
[7:30] in the beginning was the logos and the
[7:32] logos was with god
[7:34] and the logos was god so we have no
[7:37] problem
[7:38] seeing a form
[7:42] move over that began to create now
[7:44] remember
[7:46] as i've always said before all those old
[7:48] testament like
[7:49] dad was saying last sunday all the
[7:52] examples of the
[7:53] jehovah shamaw rafael that was in the
[7:56] old testament that showed up
[7:58] in a way god was trying to condescend
[8:01] to the people but we see here that
[8:04] almighty god that the same
[8:06] moses's revelation was that i met this
[8:09] burning bush
[8:11] and a man spoke to me out of that
[8:13] burning bush
[8:15] and that was jehovah
[8:18] then moses wasn't satisfied with that if
[8:21] moses revelation had been a few more
[8:23] years
[8:24] ahead of time when he saw him as a man
[8:27] remember he said now god i really want
[8:28] to see you now he saw what he saw the
[8:31] back part of a man walked by and brother
[8:32] brown said that was jesus christ in
[8:34] theophany
[8:35] form not to flesh jesus but the
[8:37] theophany form jesus
[8:38] walked by and moses then saw that it was
[8:42] a man
[8:43] all right but if moses would have had a
[8:45] revelation of that then
[8:47] at the burning bush he could have looked
[8:48] in that burning bush and he would have
[8:50] saw jesus christ
[8:51] right i just believe i mean there's just
[8:53] no other way to see it
[8:55] is that this cloud by day and pillar
[8:58] fire by night
[8:59] that's all israel had a revelation of
[9:03] was that this great jehovah god was this
[9:05] light or this
[9:06] fire or this angel even but
[9:10] if you could see him like we see him now
[9:13] because what happened to all that
[9:14] all that became jesus christ
[9:18] so but now remember god don't gain any
[9:20] attributes or gain any new form
[9:23] all those forms are in god he was just
[9:26] letting them out a little at a time
[9:28] this is how i'm going to appear to these
[9:30] people because they don't you know what
[9:31] the problem is
[9:33] understanding because god gave paul the
[9:37] new birth and said you must have the
[9:38] mind of christ yet paul didn't know
[9:40] anything about the seals
[9:41] son of man was not revealed to him like
[9:43] it was in the end time
[9:45] why he said i see through a glass darkly
[9:47] in other words his revelation wasn't
[9:49] progressed enough see but he's one of
[9:52] the greatest i mean he wrote
[9:53] 80 of the new testament so we're not
[9:55] degrading paul i'm not even degrading
[9:57] luther
[9:57] but luther just like i was telling them
[10:00] um
[10:00] in tennessee this weekend it we get
[10:03] tunnel vision
[10:06] luther's revelation of god was see i'm
[10:08] looking at sister rebecca
[10:10] and that's luther's revelation say that
[10:12] i'm looking right and that's all i can
[10:13] say
[10:15] so i can smoke a hey drink a beer
[10:18] and talk about god right but now that
[10:20] doesn't negate
[10:21] that when i do this that i see joyce and
[10:24] danny and hope and
[10:25] and tyler and and all the others you
[10:28] understand what i'm saying
[10:29] it doesn't mean they weren't sitting
[10:30] there to start with
[10:32] no this whole room is here but if you
[10:35] were to take this camera and just focus
[10:36] in on sister rebecca said well that's
[10:38] all i see
[10:38] right there there's just one woman
[10:40] sitting in this room
[10:42] and i'll describe her just like i see
[10:43] her that's what that's what luther's
[10:46] revelation of jesus christ was okay
[10:49] but that doesn't negate that all these
[10:51] other people are sitting out here it
[10:52] doesn't do away with them
[10:54] it's just luther had a vision of what
[10:57] god looked like
[10:57] right there's what he saw but now when
[10:59] wesley came what happened
[11:02] god just opened up the cube a little bit
[11:03] more and oh
[11:06] we don't need to smoke we shouldn't do
[11:08] that we shouldn't drink there was a
[11:10] consciousness brought
[11:12] to man it wasn't and that's the same way
[11:15] with god
[11:16] all right this is jehovah and this is
[11:18] all god is no
[11:20] that's all you see of god at that moment
[11:21] right
[11:23] this is all the attributes of god if he
[11:25] had ever how many of these 25 people
[11:27] sitting in the room
[11:28] if there's 25 attributes of god i just
[11:31] see one because of my limited
[11:33] vision but now as moses saw more of god
[11:37] he finally come to place he said god i
[11:39] want to see you
[11:40] like i've never seen you before so god
[11:43] said okay well now god didn't have to
[11:44] create a form that form was already
[11:46] there
[11:47] right same with with adam i believe
[11:50] adam if you were to ask adam show him a
[11:52] picture of jesus at about 20 years old
[11:54] and show him a
[11:56] a a picture of that god that adam walked
[11:58] in the cool the garden with
[11:59] he'll say that's the same man right
[12:02] melchizedek same thing melchizedek was
[12:04] jesus christ
[12:05] no other form you can't if brother danny
[12:07] was to pass on and come back
[12:10] in another form that'd be transmigrating
[12:12] souls or putting his soul in another
[12:13] form
[12:14] no he's gonna come back looking just
[12:15] like he is now because you can't do away
[12:17] with it that's the pattern
[12:19] or the impression that god made before
[12:22] the foundational world he made an
[12:23] impression in his mind
[12:24] of how you were going to look and that's
[12:26] why he could
[12:27] breed this one to this one this one to
[12:29] this one this one to this one this one
[12:31] this one this one this one
[12:32] and come right down to what you look
[12:33] like right now
[12:35] thank god
[12:43] no but see after paul after paul's age
[12:46] he saw a lot of god too but he didn't
[12:48] see all of god
[12:49] but now what happened down through the
[12:52] dark ages
[12:53] or down through time even even in
[12:55] martin's day in in
[12:56] in columbus and irenaeus's day we begin
[12:59] to narrow
[13:01] our thoughts of god down the roman
[13:03] catholic church started putting in the
[13:04] mind of the people
[13:05] hey you can't do this you can't do this
[13:07] god is not this
[13:08] god is just the church and that's
[13:12] all people saw right
[13:15] i didn't negate all the other things of
[13:17] god but they narrowed it down then
[13:19] when luther started luther started with
[13:21] that vision
[13:23] he come out of the catholic church right
[13:26] all right well that foundation began to
[13:27] grow back out again
[13:29] the bribery same thing but but let's
[13:31] look at it like in an envision
[13:33] you know this vision it didn't do away
[13:35] with all the attributes of god
[13:36] well back in the beginning it didn't do
[13:39] away with the attributes of god as being
[13:40] a healer savior redeemer
[13:43] drove a refund all the great all the
[13:45] ones manasses tisch tissue all the ones
[13:47] that
[13:48] dad's preaching about now it doesn't
[13:50] negate that they were there
[13:51] they were always there that's what i
[13:53] want you to understand about god
[13:54] god has never developed right he's
[13:57] always the same way
[13:59] that's why you can depend on him you and
[14:01] i developed brother brown said you know
[14:02] we started with a hut
[14:04] said now we live in a mansion we started
[14:06] with the two hor with the with the wheel
[14:08] the buggy the horse and buggy and he
[14:11] actually in his time he saw it literally
[14:13] come from riding a horse
[14:16] to an astronaut now
[14:19] that rocket
[14:22] was back in the 20s when brother branham
[14:26] was little and riding a horse
[14:29] right it took what man's intelligence
[14:33] to put the elements together
[14:37] brother brown said television was in the
[14:38] in the beginning in in
[14:40] adam you know back in why white
[14:43] dimensions
[14:45] people were flowing through dimensions
[14:46] uh just like you know
[14:48] the devil and and like brother joe was
[14:50] doing you know last sunday
[14:52] with the dimensions the dimensions were
[14:53] already there
[14:55] that's why i said there's no new thing
[14:56] in god it's all god's already got this
[14:59] thing
[15:00] if you see them from the beginning it's
[15:02] already done anyway
[15:04] exactly that's what i was telling them
[15:07] last sunday
[15:09] today if you had never met me before now
[15:11] this is what i understand about god and
[15:13] this is my i know a lot of you
[15:14] understand it but this is more for
[15:16] for the people on the internet here i
[15:17] stand today as
[15:19] i'll introduce myself to brother donnie
[15:21] as wade dale he says okay
[15:23] i know him as a human being
[15:26] right i know him as a human being now if
[15:29] someone walks in the door and i give him
[15:31] a big hug and a kiss and i say hey
[15:33] this is my wife june well now donny
[15:36] doesn't see a different person
[15:39] but he sees a different attribute now
[15:41] how did that attribute come out
[15:43] because she came on the scene not
[15:46] because i needed it
[15:47] for saying about god god doesn't need to
[15:50] gain attributes he always was
[15:52] a father son holy ghost but see i always
[15:55] was
[15:56] i'd been married to her for 31 years but
[15:58] if donnie just met me
[16:00] right she would manifest
[16:03] my title see but now now what happens
[16:06] now if none of you knew me but that
[16:09] little girl walked in that door a few
[16:10] minutes ago
[16:11] you'd know right quick one thing i was a
[16:14] grandpa
[16:15] now who developed that you and your mind
[16:18] me standing here
[16:18] no that little girl that walks in the
[16:20] door she identified me
[16:23] and that's what god's doing that's why
[16:24] god put people on the earth to identify
[16:27] him
[16:28] who else is going to identify god the
[16:29] animals can't they are
[16:31] god to me to me the animals when they
[16:33] say mother nature and
[16:34] nate to me nature is god that's god's
[16:38] simplest form
[16:39] he put those animals on the earth to do
[16:41] the same thing that they're doing now
[16:43] they have not changed like brother brown
[16:45] said
[16:45] he said they just have a spirit he said
[16:47] they have not changed
[16:48] a bird he said the same bird that built
[16:50] a nest in the garden of eden he said
[16:52] that same bird builds the same nest just
[16:54] like it was in the garden of eden
[16:55] he builds the same nest now all right
[16:59] but humans are not that way because he
[17:00] put an intelligence in us
[17:02] god's intelligence right all right so
[17:05] that form of god
[17:07] as the bible is unfolding we need to see
[17:09] god in our own life
[17:11] because we're the ones that's making him
[17:13] manifest i'm sorry you and i are the
[17:15] ones making them manifest
[17:16] all right so let's finish reading in the
[17:19] beginning was the logos
[17:20] and the logos was with god and the logos
[17:22] was god
[17:24] the same was in the beginning with god
[17:26] in other words no change
[17:27] everything's the same right there all
[17:29] things were made by him and without him
[17:31] was not anything made that was made
[17:33] in him was life and life with the light
[17:35] of men as the light shineth in darkness
[17:36] and darkness comprehended it not
[17:38] let's go on to verse nine because the
[17:42] other part is about john
[17:44] that was the true light capital so
[17:47] john is bringing see this little little
[17:49] light over here in verse
[17:50] four and five but he's developed after
[17:53] after john the baptist introduces this
[17:55] man we know who this man is because john
[17:57] was one to introduce him right
[17:59] that was the true life which light is
[18:02] every man that cometh into the world
[18:04] he was in the world the world was made
[18:06] by him and the world knew him not
[18:09] he came unto his own and his own
[18:10] received him not but as many as received
[18:12] him to them he gave power
[18:14] to become the sons of god power to
[18:17] become the sons of god
[18:18] that's what we're talking about see son
[18:20] of god though coming to
[18:22] in the end time he's going to be son of
[18:24] man so go ahead
[18:26] in verse nine that's the capital life
[18:29] that he separated from the court right
[18:31] right exactly that is the exact
[18:34] light we were talking about in the
[18:36] beginning that's exactly who that was
[18:38] because the light is every man that
[18:40] cometh into the world that's not the
[18:41] sunshine
[18:42] that's not the moon that's god's light
[18:44] the light of god
[18:46] all right he came unto his own and his
[18:48] own received him not verse 12. but as
[18:49] many as received him to them he gave
[18:51] gave he power to become the sons of god
[18:54] even to them that believe on his name
[18:56] now what was the name of god jesus
[18:58] christ
[19:00] which were born not of blood nor the
[19:02] will of the flesh
[19:03] that's what we were talking about this
[19:04] past weekend and we've talked about many
[19:06] times here
[19:07] not of the will of man that's your
[19:11] natural mom and dad
[19:14] because the will of man brought you here
[19:16] mother and father gets together and
[19:18] has you that's the will of man that's
[19:20] what the will of god god didn't want
[19:21] that to happen to start with
[19:23] see it says not of the will of man but
[19:25] of god
[19:27] so he's taking you and he's he's
[19:29] regening or regenerating he's making his
[19:32] generation come to light
[19:34] right so now let's go to isaiah 52
[19:38] where i ask you to read
[19:57] and we got into it a little bit but
[20:00] let's
[20:01] we see that what god done
[20:04] who hath believed i recorded into whom
[20:05] is the arm of the lord revealed
[20:07] well you and i i hope and then that
[20:10] explains the flesh of god
[20:13] what happens in verse 2 through
[20:16] 7 8 9 and there 7.
[20:19] that was the flesh of god that was the
[20:22] that was the sacrifice
[20:24] that was the son of man that was the
[20:26] human man
[20:28] that was on earth to do it to do a duty
[20:31] to do a a job
[20:33] that he was required to do because of
[20:35] what what isaiah wrote
[20:37] see jesus didn't come any other way than
[20:39] what the old testament that's why
[20:41] that's why he said to him he said who
[20:44] can convince me of sin who can who can
[20:46] accuse me of
[20:47] of not keeping the law even and all the
[20:49] things they say oh you're not supposed
[20:51] to eat
[20:52] uh what was they was eating corn on
[20:54] somebody else's field or in the sabbath
[20:55] or whatever and he said hey
[20:58] he took him right back to their law and
[21:00] told him said
[21:02] you can do that right he said you don't
[21:04] buy herself
[21:05] he said but if a man lets you in his
[21:07] field unless he didn't eat your corn for
[21:09] free
[21:10] they didn't not eat on the sabbath like
[21:13] jesus was telling them he said
[21:15] he said we're just eating somebody's
[21:17] corn we didn't buy this
[21:19] we didn't break the law law says you
[21:21] know they eat on the sabbath day certain
[21:23] things they eat so they cooked it
[21:25] but they wasn't cooking corn they were
[21:26] just eating corn out of a man's field
[21:28] i would assume and with the bible and
[21:30] him being right the guy
[21:31] whoever the person was said hey eat my
[21:34] you know
[21:35] your passion through eat my field you
[21:37] know eat the corn in my field that's the
[21:38] bible that they left
[21:40] the left around for so what they did for
[21:42] sojourners like they did with ruth and
[21:45] and the story of ruth and boaz
[21:49] they left hands full of purpose they
[21:51] they left things he said hey leave them
[21:52] for the poor people as they pass by
[21:54] well there was no date that they
[21:57] couldn't do that
[21:59] right so jesus was all the time telling
[22:02] them
[22:03] hey in other words you're not really
[22:05] getting what i was saying in the old
[22:06] testament
[22:07] in other words you i was telling you
[22:09] this and here i am fulfilling it
[22:12] and you don't have a clue you know
[22:13] you're you're just saying hey you're not
[22:14] supposed to eat this you know
[22:16] he said no you can eat it if you don't
[22:17] pay for it right
[22:19] so if you go through free it don't
[22:21] matter you know you sit there and eat
[22:23] you want to try that today no
[22:27] i think somewhere it's evolved into
[22:30] there's nothing free in this
[22:32] there's nothing there's nothing free in
[22:33] this time i
[22:39] wrote the know that you can't do all
[22:41] that you're doing on
[22:42] free stuff but we thought hey
[22:46] that's a problem we all come free
[22:49] right you know what's wrong with that oh
[22:51] yeah
[22:53] his technicalities and that's what they
[22:54] were trying to get jesus on
[22:56] technicalities but he always took him
[22:57] right back
[22:58] to the same he'd say
[23:01] hey i'm not breaking the law show me
[23:04] he walked up there to him one day and he
[23:06] said show me what i've not done
[23:08] remember read in your bible every time
[23:11] there was a feast day there was three
[23:13] that was required
[23:15] of male jewish people
[23:18] boys three feasts you had to go to i
[23:21] can't remember but it was the feast of
[23:23] tabernacles
[23:24] feast of pentecost and one other he was
[23:27] always somewhere if you'll read in the
[23:28] bible it'll say when the day of the
[23:29] feast was come
[23:31] or when the first of the month well
[23:32] there was somewhere there was a feast
[23:34] jesus was always in that temple when
[23:36] that feast day came
[23:38] because he was the because he said he
[23:40] was the lord of the harvest he was the
[23:41] lord of the feast days
[23:43] he you wouldn't see him if he wrote the
[23:45] law you wouldn't he'd be a
[23:47] a very untrue god if he wrote that law
[23:49] and then he said
[23:50] told the disciples ah you ain't got he
[23:53] ain't got to worry about that
[23:55] i mean wha who would they believe
[23:59] oh let's just go over here and you know
[24:00] let's just don't even
[24:02] know he was always in the temp in the
[24:04] temple in the tabernacle somewhere
[24:06] around those feast days
[24:08] doing the things of god because he was
[24:10] god
[24:12] but now let's go down to verse eight he
[24:14] was taken from prison
[24:15] prison and from judgment and she who
[24:18] shall declare
[24:20] his generation question mark
[24:23] who shall declare the generation now
[24:27] isaiah isaiah
[24:30] 53 8
[24:34] he was taken from prison and from
[24:36] judgment and who shall declare a
[24:37] generation
[24:38] isaiah saw this man
[24:42] from verse 1 through verse 7 like
[24:45] brother branham said
[24:46] just look like dog meat isaiah knew this
[24:50] man was going to be killed
[24:53] and there was no way that a human man
[24:56] can perpetuate his generation
[24:58] if he's dead
[25:02] have you ever thought about it like that
[25:04] he said who shall declare
[25:06] his generation because this great
[25:11] jehovah that isaiah is speaking of
[25:13] that's going to come down and take our
[25:15] transgression and our sins away
[25:17] he's going to die so who shall declare
[25:21] his generation
[25:22] just like adam
[25:25] it was adam abel and seth but but in
[25:28] your genealogy it goes from adam to seth
[25:30] why
[25:31] abel was cut off remember abel was the
[25:34] type of christ
[25:35] abel was cut off in his generation just
[25:38] like this scripture right here said
[25:39] because he was what killed before he had
[25:41] children so you take abel's
[25:43] abel has no genealogy remember we talked
[25:45] about that in the bible study
[25:47] um ryan asked the question about that
[25:50] why was abel not in the genealogy of
[25:53] adam
[25:53] well why he didn't have children cain
[25:56] killed him he was cut off and
[25:58] from the land of the living just like
[25:59] jesus christ was
[26:01] but what did the type of is you raise up
[26:03] seth
[26:06] showing the resurrection of jesus christ
[26:07] and then you had seth and enos and
[26:09] and mel and methuselah and you had a
[26:12] generation
[26:13] who shall declare this man's generation
[26:16] for he was cut off
[26:18] out of the land of the living
[26:22] no more genealogy for this guy isaiah
[26:25] said okay he's not married
[26:29] he's going to get killed how is this man
[26:32] going to do us any good if he's dead
[26:36] that's what he's asking the question who
[26:38] shall declare his
[26:40] genealogy so because his genealogy of
[26:44] jesus christ natural on the earth it did
[26:46] stop at calvary
[26:48] when that natural man died his natural
[26:50] genealogy ceased
[26:54] just speak plain he never had any
[26:56] relations with a woman
[26:58] like i don't care what the world says he
[27:00] never did that he didn't defile himself
[27:02] because he
[27:02] asked god he said sanctify this so that
[27:05] i can sanctify others
[27:06] so he he took his self out of the way
[27:09] right
[27:11] but see he's cut off out of the land of
[27:13] the living for the transgression of my
[27:15] people was he stricken
[27:17] and he made his grave with the wicked
[27:19] and with the rich in his death
[27:20] because he had done no violence neither
[27:22] was any deceit in his mouth
[27:25] yet it pleased the lord to bruise him
[27:28] he hath put him to grief when thou shalt
[27:31] make his
[27:33] flesh no
[27:37] his soul his soul
[27:41] that's why brother branham said you
[27:43] could have a court of jesus
[27:44] literal blood and be lost
[27:48] but if you ever get the life that's in
[27:50] that blood
[27:51] it'll give you eternal life what's the
[27:54] life in the blood the soul of man
[27:57] now you can't separate them because if
[27:59] you separate them the man dies just like
[28:01] jesus did
[28:02] his natural blood stopped in his body
[28:05] whatever was left in his body
[28:06] his natural blood ceased
[28:12] and that was it but the life that was in
[28:17] that blood came back three days later
[28:20] got back in that body of flesh and
[28:23] raised up
[28:25] right so the flesh of jesus
[28:30] right the flesh of jesus was the son of
[28:32] man the soul of jesus was the son of god
[28:35] everybody understand that the holy ghost
[28:37] or god in spirit form
[28:40] he said i come from god
[28:44] i come from god i go back to god
[28:48] because when he met paul
[28:52] he was back to that capital l-i-g-h-t
[28:56] right but he had picked up a flesh body
[29:00] that flesh body don't get me wrong that
[29:03] flesh body didn't save you the the flesh
[29:05] body of jesus
[29:06] it was him given his life that was in
[29:09] that body the soul of god that actually
[29:11] that's what i'm bringing to this point
[29:13] i want you to see this there's the soul
[29:16] of almighty god
[29:18] the real you remember brother brown said
[29:21] the real you well that right there
[29:22] that's
[29:22] you say well that's not the real god no
[29:24] that's the real god this is a real god
[29:26] but that's the real god this is the
[29:27] flesh of god
[29:29] but god had to come down in human flesh
[29:32] to be our brother that's why melchizedek
[29:34] could not die for your sins
[29:36] the flesh of melchizedek could not do
[29:38] you any good
[29:41] but now the soul that one that was
[29:43] melchizedek
[29:45] brother brown said became jesus christ
[29:47] because remember
[29:48] melchizedek couldn't be your brother
[29:52] he wasn't born right so he couldn't be
[29:54] your brother
[29:55] he could not be your brother because he
[29:57] was not born of a of a woman
[29:59] what he spoke that flesh into existence
[30:03] spoke it right out of existence
[30:04] that flesh couldn't couldn't take the
[30:06] stripes for your healing
[30:08] huh come on it couldn't do it god had to
[30:12] create a body
[30:14] which was him sorry it was him it was
[30:18] the body this was the body of god
[30:20] yet that body was there for your stripes
[30:22] was there for your healing
[30:24] was there read all those things wounded
[30:26] for our transgression bruised for our
[30:28] iniquity
[30:29] sure you couldn't separate the body from
[30:33] the soul
[30:33] just like me and you if you do one of
[30:36] them dies
[30:37] but that life that body in 72 hours
[30:40] would have rotted because the bible says
[30:44] lest that spirit comes back in that body
[30:47] within 72 hours
[30:49] remember remember what the psalms
[30:52] david saying he said i shall not leave
[30:55] his soul
[30:56] in what hell or suffer my holy one to
[30:59] seek corruption
[31:01] that body would have corrupted and
[31:03] rotted and blowed up and
[31:04] and deteriorated if that life of that
[31:07] man did not come back in that body
[31:10] and quicken it or change it
[31:13] right right
[31:16] just just another second then we'll
[31:18] start right back here next sunday
[31:19] yet it pleased the lord to bruise him
[31:21] when he had put into grief
[31:23] when he he hath put him to grief when
[31:26] thou shalt make
[31:27] his soul an offering for sin
[31:30] he shall see his regeneration
[31:36] he'll see his generation right there
[31:37] isaiah i believe he just had a
[31:39] hallelujah time
[31:41] because when god was revealing that to
[31:42] him and he was writing it down he was
[31:44] he was without hope up here at about
[31:46] verse 8. he said god how are you going
[31:47] to do this
[31:49] there's no generation you're going to
[31:50] bring up remember they love that
[31:52] genealogy in the old testament right
[31:54] there's no there's no genetic makeup on
[31:57] this earth
[31:58] it's going to it's going to do this oh
[32:01] but you're going to give your own life
[32:04] and that on your own life is what's
[32:06] going to do it
[32:08] see because he says right here he gave
[32:10] make his soul an offering for sin
[32:12] he shall see his seed he shall prolong
[32:16] his days and the pleasure of the lord
[32:17] shall prosper in his hand
[32:18] he shall see the travail of his soul
[32:22] and shall be satisfied by by his
[32:25] knowledge shall my righteous servant
[32:26] justify many three shall bear their
[32:28] iniquities
[32:29] therefore will i divide him a portion
[32:31] with the great and he shall divide this
[32:32] fallen strong
[32:33] because he hath poured out his soul
[32:37] unto death let's go back to
[32:41] genesis 3 15 that's when he promised
[32:44] that he would put his
[32:45] life in the womb of a woman and when
[32:48] that baby was born here
[32:49] the soul of almighty god would come down
[32:52] into human flesh
[32:54] and this is the culmination of it right
[32:56] here isaiah finally
[32:58] realizes we've got a chance
[33:01] right when he finishes isaiah 53 because
[33:05] look
[33:06] the very last verse there in 12
[33:09] and he bear the sin of many and made
[33:12] intercession
[33:13] for the transgressor that's all daniel 9
[33:17] 24. that's right
[33:18] that whole isaiah 53 exactly six full
[33:22] purpose daniel might say that
[33:25] what does them in the in the uh after
[33:27] the tribulation or during the
[33:29] uh before the treatment or during the
[33:31] tribulation for us
[33:33] puts them in the rapture this right here
[33:35] is what's gonna put us in the rapture
[33:37] isaiah 53. so let's see isaiah 53 6 4
[33:40] purpose daniel 9
[33:41] isaiah 53 same identical thing but he
[33:44] gave his soul
[33:45] the very person of god now
[33:49] let's get on this next sunday god bless
[33:53] you
[34:02] thank you baby you did a good job
[34:06] you did good i love you
[34:10] they did a good job
