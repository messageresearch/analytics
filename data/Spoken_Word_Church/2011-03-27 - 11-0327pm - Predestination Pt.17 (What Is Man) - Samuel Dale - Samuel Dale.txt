Heart Lord I open up the eyes of my heart but I wanna see I see how do you want to see you see it's your power and love foreign along we will not use Ephesians today and we'll get back up in it as we go along to express each verse kind of but let's go over to the Book of Job oh job 7. we'll just read a few verses there good to see everybody in the house of the Lord remember now Bible study is coming Saturday six o'clock on the 10th of April brother Caldwell singer will be here with us preaching for the weekend so remember that and remember uh Mr Trudy is leaving out Thursday so you know to

said you give them to us freely so we thank you we Praise Your Great Name and we just ask you to be with us now as we Endeavor to speak about you and that Lord that we may see you in this walk in the light of Your Love forgive our sins because that's the one thing that we desire is to be cleansed and walk in you and have your way now and keep us Lord that our thoughts and our meditations be set up on D we we need you because you're the one that would be all of the the the things that we have need of is all in you so then all we need is get you and us just have your way now and keep us in Jesus name job seven let me just read verse 17 and 18. what is man that thou shouldest Magnify Him and that I should have set down heart upon him and if I should have visited him every morning and try him every moment you may be seated Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now we're still in Ephesians and talking about predestination and we'll get back to some of the things but I just wanted to uh we've been so much trying to preach in eternity of going you know so far and then the eternity going so far back and if you can't go just as far back with eternity as you can forward then you don't understand what eternity is so you know but we're going to get down into that and probably uh the next service will be on uh still in the Ephesians to you know predestinated in him and and things like that to just kind of cover individually uh some of the things that are said but I just got a thought to her thinking a little bit last night you know how to approach and uh I thought well what we need to do is just really just think about you know where we are and what we're doing and really what we are amen and I just got that thought you know from the scripture and we'll get on over in a minute into Hebrews but you know uh job he was a pretty smart man and the county during the day is to be the smartest of all and uh so he asked that question what is man that thou should have Magnify Him and thou should have set thine heart upon him now we take that and we'll go we'll get over it a minute in the book of Hebrews okay and Psalms to pick up the others but um I want you to think on it because I wrote in my Bible many years ago there in Hebrews 2 you know we're talking about what his man in the dark mindful of him and the son of man that thou envisages him and I wrote dire I wrote bride and Son of Man you know because that's what I want you to think about right see we we take it as being just you know when it says what is man we take it as being just the son of man see God will take that and we'll read it and all let's just go there and read that one where we'll have it in our our talk go to Hebrews 6. and uh you know Hebrews 2 6. and uh just just think on a little something because that's what I want to get a point across now what do you what are you ever thought about what you are Mommy what do you mean not me you know I'm a human being but have you ever thought about it it's really thought about it so think on this verse 6 Hebrews 2 verse 6. but one in a certain place testified saying what is man that dark mindful of him are the son of man that thou visited him all right see Thou made us him a little lower than the angels I promise him with glory and honor and just set him over the works of thy hands that has put all things in subjection under his feet but in that he put all in subjection under him he'll have nothing that's not put under him but now we see not yet all things put under him but we see Jesus okay so when you really you know when people you say well what the scripture what is man and in your mind will automatically go over to thinking about the son of man me but I don't want you to do that I want you to think about the question if not asked of who is the son of man because God knew who that was right you know or what is the son of man the question is what is man you know what is man that thou art mindful of you well she back over again in job see he didn't list anything there about the son of man see he just said what is man that dog that thou shouldest Magnify Him you know honor and glory and things to be brought to him all right then he's asking us the question do you know who you are what is man why would God be concerned about man what would be the the point that he would he would be any thoughts concerned drop over a couple of scriptures in in the 15th chapter and uh you know 15th chapter in the 14th verse what is man that thou should that he should be cleaned so now we know that that's not talking about the son of man and he which is born of a woman that he should be righteous why would God be concerned about man that's much more what is it so great about man that would cause God to consider it or ask the question what is my all right go over and Psalms I'm ready this is the one where it's picked up from Hebrews but it doesn't carry all the way you remember and Paul picks it up a little higher he said what is man that dark mindful of him and the son of man the top visits him for that's made him a little lower you know crowned him with glory and honors and made us him to have dominion over the works of thy hands now I thought we believed that man in his original condition or existence or thought you know as a spiritual man that that spiritual man was placed Over the Garden that's right that you could rule the animals you know like the Holy Spirit does because he was in that form now we'll get to that in the next message or so but the point I want you to think about now is just think about yourself right what is it good about man I mean are we so wonderful you really I I'm wondering about it because that was the thought that what is man why would God not be uh just as concerned or thoughtful about the animals when they're under his control and they can you know a storm can be coming right and there's a Wonder his control until they'll leave the place get out of the Rocks because of the earthquakes they'll they can be led and man had to be driven into the ark right I mean sure he was told to build an ark but he basically had to be made go into art but the animals travel from all over the world it took 120 years to to build the art well it probably took God 120 years to get all the animals to travel you know the distance he had to get him to travel because you didn't have no boats back then to run over and pick them up bring them over for you you know but I got thinking about that one time and I was looking at you know and seeing how long it would take say for an elephant to leave Africa and keep migrating and keep migrating and keep migrating and then you wind up with two of them to her you know to to get in the ark but yet my point is God could lead them right and he can lead the animals he looked like he'd be more satisfied with the animals than he is with anything you know of us but you know what really makes God so mindful and brother Theo a rationalize if you remember him always liked him he's a good brother you know and he always had a little catch phrases and things and kind of my brother Ernie going away you know he had his own little way of saying it and he said he preached on that one time you know what his man the dark mindful of him and he said see that he said God's mind is just full of us he's just full of us because he's mindful so his mind is just packed full well why what's what is so great about man that would make God the creator of all the universe but yet he would bottle himself or whatever would be the word for it right to come down to earth make all of the things and brother Brown said he knew that some of us would like mountains and City creative mountains he said he knew some would like planes flat land somewhere like this some would like the ocean some would like this you know mountainous ranges whatever and he said he made all of that brush he put everything there for you and I yep and we wound up being the last creation you know in the chain of creating I told you we're going to go back and start this Earthly Journey now and travel along a little bit in it on predestination where we can see it but he made you and I the last one now what did why did he bring everything down to where you and I are at you know oh I know we think we're pretty you know we think we're dead we think we're all kind of things you know we think we're so great until that no what what is the point why would Joe asked the question two times the psalmist asked the question and then Paul asked the question what is man and each time that I said we want to just go on over to the son of man but each time it's asking a question about man and telling though that man is to be over everything to rule over everything but why what's the what's the point me why would he not be as concerned with the animal life to say what is a monkey what is this or what is that but no it's what is man so there must be something about man that is coming down into the highest chain of creation that would bring that man to a place that God was pleased all right so you'll find it in Genesis that he was pleased to the first day you know second day Third Day Etc he was pleased at his creation right but he made us the last coming in on the sixth day and being man and as he did what made him so concerned that he would tie up the entire world to try to get an answer to you and I no went on that beat God had always tried to contact man you look down through the Old Testament you see the things happening you see men that would be like Moses that would you know come so close to God until that he would actually be speaking you know and God you know they decided to cover his face because he'd been in the presence of God and he was pleased with man even though a fallen State a state right he didn't destroy us when we sinned nope you say well he was just looking at the atonement was I'm glad with that whatever you're looking at but the point is he didn't destroy us amen is it that he loves a sinful no no that's beside the point but maybe it's in our creation because of where the lies and the creation then maybe it's in that creation do we know that they're in Genesis and we'll get back to that it's the spiritual part later but I want you to hold it just the name of this thing I'm just you know I'm just going to just talk to you about it and just it's something that's on the heart and you listen you know God is a Triune being all right Father Son and Holy Ghost right and when he created man he created a crown being a body spirit so you know any creative in His image now if you don't like the word image there in Genesis for the natural man just say lightness to him because it does have image and likeness you know so if you don't like image too much just use the word likeness and forgive my my inability to understand but my point is man even in his Fallen estate he's still in the image of God amen even in the Fallen estate none of the animals sure and I know they can progressively train them to do things Etc yeah but still they've never been able to train a bird how to build its nest any different right it may have had to adapt to the position it built it in that instead of building it in a tree it builds it in the corner of your house or somewhere where it can find a hole but you know I steal this bill that mess everything's the same but man is constantly changing I'm 70 years old and in my lifetime we have went from a horse and buggy you know to an astronaut all right In Our Lifetime the advancement of science no the word that we we're it's just almost uh Unthinkable about the things that man can do you're sitting with a a little cell phone in your pocket there and those things are a computer you know I mean you know it can do everything that the big laptop computer can do and contact things and do everything just you know it was created by man right even medical science do we go off on a lot of the things but even in medical science you know that's what I was telling Brother Dean the other day I said when they they said that that that aneurysm remember how you pronounce this big old word that was there I said when they said that it was what was causing the trouble I said well thank God that it made your eye to start hurting because had it not it may have just blowed out and killed you know all right every how they found brother Danny's there and operated see thank God for that I mean back when we was kids you know you didn't have anything to her if he did he didn't know what to do and we had our own home home remedies and and those were just about as good as anything because if you got the coffin they would just take some some uh kerosene and and a little sugar and or something like that coal oil and and they put that sugar on that kerosene or kerosene on the sugar and you'd be creeping like everything and coughing well once you've got that and put it in your mouth you didn't cough no more it may have been self-control it kept you from coughing but you just didn't cough anymore because it would just clean out everything well now we don't do that today you know we take a cough dropper we take a go get some some kind of medicine something for it but you see how that we've Advanced all right because it says in Genesis that that nothing is withholding from the imagination of man and we really are in the day that you can see that right that now it's never been that instantly around the world you know I mean you can talk on the telephone you know we was in Israel and Manny woke up and said what are you doing I said I'm calling them at the church yes son six or nine hours different anyhow I calculated the time and she said what time is it here I said three in the morning what do you call it a three in the morning or I said it's not three in the morning dark well see that was good but now it's a whole lot more instant than that everything is just so great until it's it's almost you know beyond the thinking of man's mind right and the reason that he can do that is because he's a little Creator right yeah he's a little creator he can take things and work it out I've always said to you you can destroy right now the uh the things it took no telling it probably took for the first two thousand years it probably took a thousand years for them to develop a way to to temper meddling things from doing things right but you see even what knowledge was brought over to Ark and just you know knowing his children you know it was just a little while they were tempering metal again well because they had the knowledge of it and look what he'd be now if you just wiped out everything but left just a few people with a little knowledge you can bring it right back why because we're a little creators right that's right and see that's what God likes about us thank you Elijah the part about us being the word it We're In His Image like I said even in our fallen estate right sure we hadn't fail we wouldn't need all of this but in our fallen estate they just constantly coming up with some way of doing something better we're building houses better we're building cars better we're we're doing all kind of things a whole lot better than we used to be because they were a little creative but see God then is pleased to dwell with us yeah no I mean I'm carnal I know sorry but you know I think God would be more and more enjoyment sitting down and talking to Einstein about his theories than it would be because I don't know anything about them you know you understand what I'm trying to get across that there's something about you and I that makes God want to dwell with us amen when he created this for worship well that's true but he dwells with us when we don't even worship Him right so what is man he's created in the image of his maker and I keep saying that even in the Fallen estate that man is still it's it's just Unthinkable about this the ability of mankind and if that be true then there must be something there that he likes no what is it that would make him like us so much it's because we're created in His image that's it he's a Trion being foreign I believe almighty God is real right man I don't believe him and just think about him as being some kind of a mythologies or a myths or thoughts I believe he's real I believe he's more tangible than we're tangible right which is he's asked the question do you know what you are well yeah I know I made in the image of a maker but but what image you see this is where most people don't even want to go that far about it because they want to say God is the spirit and no no I believe God is real you want to know what I think God looks like I think it looks like you hey I Think Jesus was the proof of that he was almighty God made into human flesh but do we really know who we are and what we're doing you know we were brought here for a purpose and is it just to worship that's what people deal with you know we're probably here to worship God we're brought here huh no we're brought here for rulership right we'll get to more of that on adoptions and things but we're brought here to rule the world sure look what a garbage can we've made out of it right but that's still beside the point that he brought us here for that purpose that's what the psalmist said that's what that job said everything was to be under our Dominion and even in your Fallen estate the very very few animals that are not fully under our subjection as far as leadership and they can even be brought to that right they've trained almost every animal and form in the world from virus to mankind has been able to take over and and train them so it means there's something about you that those animals are that's right under your subjection so that's why they tell you for buyers attack scream at it you take a dog ask any of these you take a dog that's coming at you speak to him in a Stern voice I'm scared of you don't get out of here no get out of here and leave me alone let's turn the voice the quicker they'll mind you why because there's something about you he was made to be under your subjection and even in your Fallen estate he's under your subjection the Bible says you know that we put uh what is it bridles in the horse's mouth and the things we've been able to train as I said almost every animal in the world in some way or other at one time had been able to be conquered of mankind right because he's their master and brother random I'll give you a quote later about it but he said to our work said let us make man he said that was God talking to the animals you know how he was going to make the man in other words he's gonna make him a ruler over them right and even though we're you know even though it's a fallen estate it's still that rule factor is there live the what if man all right so then if we're a try and being we need to understand about that a little we can spend a lot of time talking about things but you know we need to understand see we only as I said we take where it says what is man and we just leave that alone we don't want to fool with that but then when it comes you know and the son of man we emphasize that but the emphasis is upon the question that was to start with what his man she being a try on being then to be Body Spirit and soul then we deal with God or should deal with God as a try on being but when we say try on being of God what do we say father son Holy Ghost right foreign we just put it on that basis but why can't we look farther back and see that almighty God is more real than we are you mean he would just floating around up there's a glove you know this why can't we think of him being Body Spirit and soul that's right why can't we think of him as being real Cody made Man real right right gave us Dominion gave us all the things and I keep saying Even in our fallen estate that image is still dark that we're we're a little creator and God likes that because he brought into being he could fellowship with the animals and lead him sure but he brought into being a man that he could fellowship with did we take it as Fellowship on the basis that that he created us for Fellowship well why not take it to bases that he created us for fellowship and plain sense about what it's saying he created us to fellowship with us we want to put all the emphasis about fellowshipping with him that's right but he wants to fellowship with us you don't run around said he'd come down in the cool of the evening or in the garden and he said children have you had a good day today have you enjoyed this day in the garden he said he'd put him to sleep at night and said he was pleased amen I thought he was pleased he was happy well because he had something in his own image right he had something he could fellowship with see I'm trying to compare it now he because he couldn't fellowship with the animal Kingdom because they were not like him they were a whole lot better than you and I but they still wouldn't like him and why can't you believe God is real because he made you and I real amen and he made us to fellowship with us you might as a trial and being thought did it we were in His image he was a Triumph being she understood their mind go father son Holy Ghost no if we're a crown being Body Spirit and soul he was a Trion being Body Spirit and soul it took quite a while to bring it into being that's right that he could manifest himself but you know what the biggest portion of his manifestation of himself was brought into being after we fail all right all right amen you'd be easy to understand how he could come down as I said in the garden with Adam and Eve and there was no sin no problem right but yet the biggest portion of his downward descent toward his brain into being upon what we call time and Earth has taken place after the fall of mankind all right so don't you think he might still be pleased to dwell now we want our children to do good don't we you know we want our children to be good and to do good and we're happy about them doing anything but now just because it they're not exactly the way that we like them do we quit fellowshipping with them no it's been a proven fact the meanest kid in the family gets all of its benefits right you can argue with that if you want to but it's true you take one of the kids in the family they got maybe four kids and maybe four boys you know and three of them is pretty good guys and they went out and they're doing all right and one of them sorry slot and mud wouldn't work for nothing but who does mom and daddy take care of it just trying to make a point right all right I ain't saying that we come into the world to cut Sinners that make God happy now don't get misunderstand me I'm trying to illustrate but even in the Fallen condition God still wants to come down and fellowship with you and I am that's where it's always been yeah why because we're created in this image so then if we're a trial and being why can't we believe he's a trial and being right all right man right when this is over with are we going up to heaven you know and we're going to get up there and there's going to be a little Pillar of Fire over here that's the father gonna be a little Dove over here at the Holy Ghost and no I thought the Bible said that we would be like him you know and I thought the prophet said that when we get there we'll see him it won't be just floating around clouds and pillars of Fire to be real it seemingly to me has been the hardest thing to try to preach one God in the correct order that's ever been on this one basis is to try to get people to see what I believe that God is real when you talk about father son holy holy God but do you believe God is real or is he just the thoughts of your mind because if he if he's Spirit or something now if if we are real and he's not real well which one is the best or which you know we would be greater than him right right but he wanted man to live on the earth and rule the Earth and now listen you can argued a point do all you want to but man was made to put in the garden to till the soil that's right that's before the fall see we want to make it after the fall that he had to do it now after the fall is the sweat of your brow nowhere to become hard to do all right amen oh yeah but man was put here until the storm yep to take care of the garden sure it works on them yep amen there's minor G credit said where that's the word we don't like but what's the problem with work all right you know what's the trouble with it sorry laziness having a lot of trouble with it but now listen I'm trying to just get a plain little point to you about something that the Lord began to deal with me about it because he has for years about this and you know I preached on it and I believe God is real but I don't believe he's just some floating around something that you can't you know find him and you know you just uh I believe he's real I believe he's more real than we are well now brother Dale is the 16 elements well his body comes from 16 elements that's right amen okay but I believe this the afternoon sole being of his person was more real than than what we're talking about here amen because we believe he brought us here why can't we believe the one great is greater that brought us here than what we are right amen amen but you see then you get into the the message of the hour and people they have trouble to understanding Body Spirit and soul and they think well that your your soul well it's just the nature of your spirit well now you're not making it real you're making it just something you think just the nature it's a thought let's see you're real right amen that's right that's easy to look at the body and see that it's pretty real but you know what we get so tied up into that until we think that's the real thing now inside of you is something greater than you are because this body can't figure out how to make no no airplane different or a car different right this body ain't nothing but just moving it and just you know moving muscles and things it doesn't have any thinking ability right you can't figure out things it's no different than animal right man and if you leave him with just the spirit part of him you're no different than any animal there is amen and there was a doctor in many many years ago before I heard of the message I ran into it that man didn't have a soul till the law came oh well I mean I heard a man sit there and teach it they're adorable and I just asked him one simple question I said well you know I I thought that the Bible said that God breathed into the nostrils of Adam and he'd become a living soul right he said I never thought of that but you know what I mean I I didn't know nothing but I did try to believe the word all right but see is your God real or are you more real than your God is all right which way is it me but see then we get into the intellectualism of the Mind as we call it well you know that brain of your intellectualism and all like that's your spiritual part of you whatever you want to call it memory reason constant defections you know that that that's no different than animal unless there's something controlling it right right just the highest form of animals so when he created man he made Man In His Image now can I quote brother Brown he made your body in the image of the animal a hand like a chimpanzee a foot like a bar Etc so he created our bodies in the image of animal life so what was the real part that was created in the image of God be the soul of mankind see then we make it this shoulder it was just a nature now you're bringing it down to something that you're not letting it be real and you're saying the same thing we used to say well God it's just a spirit what do you mean brother Dale he's real he's just a spirit well you better remember one thing if he is just the spirit that spirit is more real than you are cause that's being brought you here right right amen but see we want to just do it that way so what his name the when he created me and he made him in his image so the real soul of you is what the image of God is right right what is your soul well it's just some kind of nature you got any well then the dogs out of the way because you got dogs that are that are they're naturally born and you don't have to train them to be a bird dog right they'll go out and bring burnt off yep because it's a nature that's born within them but seeing Mankind we have to be trained you take a little puppy dog you know nothing just gets working walk you know two weeks old or something maybe or a month oh whatever just a little puppy dog and you say that on the edge of a table and you know what it'll sit there and wine and look off right but you put a baby out there that can crawl it'll crawl off and fall so which one's smarter right the the nature is still there of each one because they're natural but there's something about that baby then that you'll give that baby a little while to grow up and something begins to motivate within it and to come out into a controlling Factor until it not only will not fall off the table it can make a table me well that's the real you the real you now but you're a Trion being a body spirit and soul and here's where in the message that people go wrong then when I come to this I must explain one thing that the Lord showed me many years ago when I thank God for it basically up until 1962 on the message called the greatest battle ever fought I said basically now because get my point in a minute you'll see basically up until that point brother Brown would cover a human being as being body Soul and Spirit that's the way he would describe your body Soul and Spirit all right but then after the the word began to be revealed to him and right after you go to the greatest battle ever fought you watch him he's just going like this he just seemingly having the problem with his battle in and understanding but then after then you watch him and he always teach them what Body Spirit and soul in the beginning he would put the spirit as the center Realm may you study the message I got two quotes laying here in front of them if you want them one of them on the inside in 1962 see 119 that he called his body Soul and Spirit and then on the Rapture message in 1965 he covers his body spirit and soul I know just two it's brought to you see that's where people go wrong with understanding the Bible and then they don't understand their own selves see then we go over to what is it uh is it Ezekiel works and I'll give you a new heart and your spirit 36. you see I'm glad brother random explained that right amen he said see there I should give you a new heart and your spirit he said you couldn't under you couldn't even fellowship with your own self with your old spirit yeah he said that's not the Holy Spirit that's right man he said because he gave you a new heart a new spirit he said that's not the Holy Spirit he said then he went on to say and and I put my spirit in you he said that's the Holy Spirit that's right but yet even in the time that he was quoting those scriptures and giving the understanding he added to the basis that the spirit was the center in with you and the Soul was the second ring he said well I've never heard run around and explain he's wrong he wouldn't you went wrong he didn't have to explain it because he never changed his senses no matter what he called it body we can always go with what she takes me or smell in here the second rim of man he would give the second realm of man memory reason conscience Etc whatever those five senses and the center of man would always be one since neither Faith or doubt it's not faith and doubt they hit it on that drawing back there and I erased it put on our faith or doubt that I've got in my office but it's not faith and doubt right his faith or doubt right all right but you get the point one saying see then the prophet didn't have to come back and say well look I was wrong explaining this about the soul and the spirit one because he always had his senses correct right through this goal when you're starting to study what you're talking about go and see what the sense is he's saying and if he says so and he says when people taste it see the Earth see there we get a new soul because that's the quote you know people say we get we get a new soul to every Prophet said we'll go back and see what he's talking about right he's talking about your second Rim right all right go check your senses just read a little bit you remember how it expressed it to you over and over and over all these years where the brother runs in our language is so messed up with about the board you know come on board pay your board because I'm bored with you no but all you got to do is just explain what you talking about each time you know what's the man talking about come on board stand on that board and pay your board because I'm bored with you now you know exactly what I'm talking about right but if you don't express it so what is it the before and after is always the answer so go back and study the prophet's message when he says you get a New Soul watch him and he'll cover in a minute that they sense as he's talking about see that you'd be surprised what that that cost me in fellowship with a lot of people but it's as playing it could be but explain to me that that's the way it is because he never changed them senses uh doing whether he called it Soul or spirit and see that's where you two Soul people came in that's where your uh your people that believe you get a New Soul you're coming down with the the different ones they use those quotes it's just like the man about the seven Thunder virtue random didn't know what the Thunders were until the seals broke he said he didn't and he said the Thunder was a voice when the seal broke and then they'll turn around and take a a 61 or 60 quote out of the church age book of thousands of live voices thundering out all right so she's already got them Thunders didn't even know what the Thunders were but you see that's always seemed to been my like maybe if you want to call anything that somebody's in the world for maybe mine has been to take all of those things where the contradictory look like statements come from and bring them down to a simple thing just like what we've been through in predestination where I always was eternal the prophet said if you have eternal life right now the before and after explained it didn't it if you have eternal life you always was eternal me go to see eternal life all right see I like it like that to me that's what I'm saying this morning with the restoration of the word with the restoration of the reveal work come to Restoration of power right all right he said well I I just don't see it I just don't see the power now what are you looking for words of that in you me why are you judging my my Apples by your one rotten one hmm but listen neither do we get it correctly to understand that you're a Triumph being what do you want to say Body Spirit Soul or Body Soul and Spirit as long as you know what you're talking about you can see that you're a trial and being you're not a trinity you're a trial and being exactly in the image of almighty God and like I said it took a long time to bring down things into order of God to break it down to where you could see that God was real he appeared in the Old Testament as Melchizedek right but Mankind's never been able to understand that one the prophet of God said we no longer see Melchizedek he said because male chatted it became Jesus Christ right now I told you back a month ago I guess was that we get down to it eventually and I won't finish the day on it but you don't find the soul being dealt with now I didn't say you didn't find a soul the word sold in the Old Testament I happen to look that up at 399 times so you worked soul is used in the Old Testament as a matter of fact it's used more in the Old Testament than this than you it worked so I didn't say now that you can't find a soul in the Old Testament right right you can't find a man in the Old Testament and understood her soul even David said my soul thirst after thee oh God we need another new burger the soul of man has always been a problem for mankind to understand because if we don't make it real what are we amen it's just some kind of a nature we got then the anointing can fall on you now anointed ones have the anointing on their Spirit right all right but you know anointed ones the anointing is genuine right right now what they do wrong is not the anointing right right they go out and live like the devil it's not the anointing that makes them live like the devil the anointing is the good part about them right but you see they don't understand the real part that's why you say well well all it is just understand well how come people don't understand anointing one right I'm talking about me and you do you really understand how the anointing can be on you and anoint you to do exactly right and you still be lost the anointing could be on you to get you to come to church to cry to pray to worship God Amen and you still be lost but we better quit dealing with something in a spiritual realm that we don't know what we're talking about you know that we can't get straight well brother Dale I I know I got the Holy Ghost God I love the Bible I loved it when I was in the Baptist well I know I'm right cause I know I got the Holy Ghost because I come in the message well the devil's got it on you because he beats you here all right right but you see we'll never be able to conquer death somebody's got to face this thing right and walk straight through death right and we'll never be able to do that until we understand who we are right and what we're doing here right God created you and me for a purpose amen that's right he's got something for you to do amen it's not all in the preacher's hands that's where the Prophet said be done he said they took it off of The Laffy back there and put it on the preacher let him do my praying let him do my doing let him tell me what God wants me to know he said that's wrong I like to preach to a group of people that knows what what the message is right man that's right no no man it used to in this message was made to be a big guy he told Brother monk one day he said you don't want to give them people all them books and Tasties because they don't wind up knowing much as you did oh my God said I want him to know what I know that's what I want you to know that's right you're not having to study for a message you can read anywhere God leads you to leave read from you know you just pick up books and study them I'm reading for a message all right I'm trying to find the mind of God for what I preach on but I want you to know see when I say try on being you say try on being I said we're trying to be in what are we you might say Body Spirit and soul man now say we're created in the image of God and even in our fallen estate and then you know the prophet said I give you the quotes when I think that there's a situation there that you're gonna maybe not understand what I'm doing you see I can preach for that note you know a quality to one because I get to talk and it's always to me what is man I'm sitting there praying Lord where did I go next what'd I say I said what is man okay what do you mean man it'll try on being created in the image of almighty God and even if still wants to come down and fellowship with us nurse in no with us as beings because he's real and he knows we're real and if like I said then I can can say when I've run around and said Body Spirit and soul you made me say My Soul and Spirit you say Amen we understand we understand that he just didn't change the senses so he didn't have to go back and re preach the message over again he ate it right yeah The Simpsons was always right so just read the sentence listen to what it is if he says stolen he starts talking about imagination remember you know what he's talking about thank you all right but see then us being what we are Body Spirit and soul and the real the person of you is the inner part the inner part of Youth the soul the center part of you is more real than your body and spirit all right amen right because that's the center part of you it's just like it was in the Old Testament when they had what the outer Court the inner Court but then they had the holy of holies which one do you want to live in if you want to live in the presence of God you wanted to go behind the veil right to the inner Veil the inner Court to the holy of holies because that's where God was at when she back there to show that that it wasn't in its right place to come forth to even be able to understand Body Spirit and souls I mean only the high priest could go behind her right but you know what I love about it until that was dedicated and set to the place now I watch this and I listened I never never hear preachers wanting to bring this out but until that was set in place until the dedication of the temple you know that Moses could walk behind her you know that Joshua could go behind her to make sure everything was made right you're a thought man somebody made it right behind her somebody built it the way it was supposed to be right somebody put them cherubims over the yard somebody put the Ark in there but once it was dedicated see the church listen what's it would come into being Lord Jesus Christ upon the Earth do we ever to be at that's right man it already gone all right but it couldn't happen in the Old Testament because once they dedicated that Moses couldn't go behind her right the only one could go there with the high preach and he had to be dedicated just right everything had to be perfect or he died right right and They Carried that around through the Wilderness for 400 years and nobody didn't know what was behind her except the high priest but I wonder how many sermons I don't know why freaks come out and preached after seeing what he's off he'd come out there trying to describe what was back there he said you ain't never seen nothing like it said you don't have to lie no no candles you don't have to have nothing there's this beautiful mind amen make sure we'll draw it out here and he draws it out and he puts the cherry bin and he puts the ark and he puts the the two tables of stone you know what Moses put in there and he drawing and everything else don't look too glorious to me all it is is a bunch of junk but to that high priest while he was in that presence yep he could prove that it wouldn't junk either you know what he got that nobody else didn't get ever knew high priest was dedicated got a chance to eat a piece of that manner that manner that was in the wilderness that everybody could eat but one day it stopped didn't it but you know what they took a bunch of it and put it in the the container They carried in behind there and Moses set it down and you know it never got old that I preached he could get a piece of that and he could come out he said but I've tasted it amen but to anybody else it's just no well I'm gonna just disturb me I don't know this way and I don't understand that because God told me not to make no images and there he is he told us to make them that's the way the carnality of human mind is right that's right but you see it's the outer Court the inner core the holy of holies which is the most important then right me a gentile was allowed into the outer sections of the outer court but you know that he couldn't go into the inner Court could only be one dedicated for the job then the high priest was the only one could go behind the veil see so which one is the most important the outer Court the inner court or the holy holies which one's the most important about you your body your spirit and run around even explain it he says you don't love your soul he said you love with your spirit because your soul is either lover for Satan it's either God or it's either Faith or doubt it's either one of the two right it's not no mixture in there right but now get the point now I'm getting slow so the real person you are is the inner being of you that is called a soul the real you the inner being is called a soul you say oh but brother Dale it's just the nature of some spirit see there's word and see what the devil's done with that he's blinded the eyes of the people until they can't see that's right oh it was just well the priest told me it was just it's just going to put it this will put you and that's what Darkness and they're blinded so it's the preachers of this message blinded the people died amen to the point that they just look at it and say what's yours no just the nature of experience it's just you know it's just some nature no it's the real you amen that's right we read and preached just a few weeks ago about what that in Ezekiel 18 4 we read that All Souls are mine but did you remember what the likes of it said and he says it again in Ezekiel 18 20 it says in 1804 and he says it again in 1820 he said the soul that sent us and she'll die now the real part of you is your soul because that's what you are a being a person Bears the image of God more than your natural cause your body's in the image of the animals and that Soul inside of you is that in that image of that one that was behind the veil right see so the soul that sinneth it shall die it doesn't say in the Bible that the spirit that sentences shall die right he says the soul is sin and like I said it took brother Branham 30 something years for the opening of the word to get to him of Hebrews 44 12. that is the dividing of the Soul and Spirit and Joint Marinol right it took all of that time for it to get to the prophet that he would bring it and praise it in his life part of his years especially the lights say three part three years of his life he would explain it as body spirit and soul and it took him 30 something years to get to there to explain that well yeah we know all about it do we even know what a man is like I said what is death we go we look in this in the casket we say oh Lord look at them they're dead you're not looking at the person right you're looking at the body they used to inhabit right right man the person is done gone right and then what you see that's why in Revelations 20 and 6 . and you got it into church ages and all like that we're just talking of what you won't be hurt by the second death now what is the second death right you'll have part in the first resurrection over which the second death right will have no part right amen what is the second death now your Prophet said on the message some earning Church age 1960 1206 that the second death is the death of the Soul see now the Earth even back before the opening but he knew what it was why because he knew what the scripture says redescript read the quote he would know when he said so he would know that it says the soul that sentence shall die I mean but do we understand thank you Jesus spoke of it in Matthew 10 and 28 he said Don't Fear him that can destroy the body but said fear him that can destroy the soul and body amen listen he said in hell go read it then go over to Luke the 12th chapter verse 4 and 5 almost the same quote but he says he'll cast that Soul into hell in other words what is the second day of the death of the Soul what's going to be the last thing destroyed the real you now listen to what I'm saying your body is going to be in the ground right so that's not the real you that's already burned up rottened out and gone do you say well the Bible said the spirit goes back to God who gave it all right but be careful don't bring back an ungodly thing and join it back to God it's just a statement of showing what it does it's released from the body it's released it's gone if you can't take it back to God the one that really goes back to God who gave it is the new performing in your new birth in you because that's the change of the body and spirit because that's what we need we need a change of the spirit let alone a change of the body then it can go back to God who gave it amen all right see my real point then what is we need to understand the soul that's why the animal alive see it had no soul it could be used of God to cover our sins through the blood of the animal but it had no life within it that could come back upon the human being right go to the numbers right God permitted a man to be born because of the fall in a perverted world and he he gave him a a body you know allowed it to come and a spirit no soul the soul is the real deal right so the animal even though it can adapt it still can't reason things out I'm going to do now Michelle see the soul is what you are the real part of you is that soul that is created in the image of God now that's why it's got to be recreated in the new birth to bring about Genesis 1 26 and 27 into the right condition right because they're fitting back there we'll get to that later but just think about it look how we've advanced look how great the the soul of mankind is that even lead the animals he has control of those things but yet someone came to die right and he gave his own life as a ransom right right now this needs to talk about the River Jordan and all of it well then you've got to admit that brother Brown said the anointing left Jesus in the garden the anointing that came on in one of the River Jordan left him in the garden that's quote from your prophet so where's your new birth of course you're so spiritual you don't need one hmm you know all about the quotes that he always was eternal but then why did Jesus have to die then why wasn't it sufficient what left him in the garden to be able to come back upon us to give us understanding why would that not be your new birth but that anointing left him in the garden your Prophet said he said the spirit left him in the garden now you know if it would have been his Natural Spirit he'd been dead right there that's right so as your anointing came on him on the River Jordan left him but he cried out on the cross into thy hand I come in my spirit that Soul was ripped out of that body to play the prize because he'd take a soul to pay a price body to body is one thing spiritual spirit is another thing but that only deals with anointed ones spiritual Spirit but Soul or Soul we can become the very offspring of almighty God we could become the children of God Amen see he came to to bring man back to the place to restore Fellowship right he came to bring us to that place God wants to restore man to his rightful place and man in his rightful place is what Body Spirit and soul Farm after almighty God to understand then why it would be like it is but Iran says your brain is not your intelligence he said Satan in the garden took man's brain he said but God took man's heart what is the soul of man the heart of man not the thumping gizzard you know the thing that beats the blood the heart that's not your soul that's not your that's not the center of you the center of you is that light right that reality so the soul is the real you and thereby then if you do die now I'm just going to say this and leave it because it's the end of the message he said if you do die you got a place to go but it's one or two right you've got a Celestial body you say so that's real good that's going up and I'll brought around cover Celestial going down too yeah he says according to which one you're pulling from right if you're born again the pool is going upward he said if you're not it's going downward all right so you have a place to go to a center when he dies he has a place to go to if so goes where The Fifth Dimension right The Sinner did and waits there to be brought back into his Natural Body to stand it to judgment to be judged you see the born-again Christian he has an outward pool see so you see then if the new birth is just the anointing of the spirit look where it would put you the new birth is not just the anointing of the spirit all right it's the birth of the Soul you see eternal life through Jesus Christ amen so do you understand who you are what is man he's a body spirit so created in the image of his maker and even in the Fallen estate God thought so much of us to come down and died for us come over take on these things what is man he's controller of the Earth he traveled through space like it's not even thinning thing there and if you ever think about how technical all of this stuff is you know that before they ever sent one of those Rockets into space they had to calculate ever a moving element in his face that they could find and calculate where they would be when that rocket would get there because it didn't it was destroyed and in doing that you know what they found that there was in their calendar systems and all they found it was a day missing you read the story it was a day missing an older calendar system this one day off you know what they've done they went back to the Bible they said would anybody know any place you know anything we can find this day and this man said yes in the Bible and they read it yep said to Sean there and Joshua Stood Still but to catch what it said about today because you know what they done and don't ask me how they done it but they've done it because they could prove it they run it back and they said you're missing about 20 minutes right in your space of time right the man looked at it and he said well it does say about a day so then he went back over and he said well is there another he said yeah yes sir when the man would come up to the time that he was going to die you know yes and God told him no it'll be all right I'll give you 15 years you know he said well for it to go forward is easy but said turn it back to God he turned it back so many degrees and it was exactly the 20 minutes that man could pull the Bible is right had to read the Bible to start with he wouldn't have no trouble wouldn't it right let's see what are what is man I look at these little children and I see him and I want you to be educated you know and go to school and to learn and I look at them and I see them you know if time lasted huh if time lasted our little coal would be maybe a jet airplane or back then it'd be Rockets you know Tommy gets up over in the might be a doctor or a scientist you know why because he's a student and being a soul he has thinking abilities he could reason out things yeah okay he could turn out to be whatever he wants to be you can beat what you want to we had a president but one time they couldn't read but you know he taught himself to read reading the Bible become president of the United States right to show how easy it was done and then we just had a man to come up to be president and you'd say oh you want to about him he's going to argue with nobody but you know we wound up with a man that is an African descent to be our president you say well now he's not he's from Hawaii but his natural descent that's come from somewhere over the heart you know they're still arguing about whether he is or not but that's no I'm just my point is you can be what you want to be you don't have to be a lazy shiftless bum I told him that Jamaica and it's hard to find a job there but I said you don't have to do it you can get out here and get you something well they didn't like it the pastor actor then he said man you really laid it on I said is it the truth you don't have to be a lazy shiftless bum give me my money you're at the bank like I said this morning it wouldn't matter to me if I was your green black purple whatever color my skin is whatever nationality I come from I am a child of almighty God I'm a child of almighty God and I want to stand up for that yes amen to be what God wants me to be yes don't ever do like they did with who was the guy stepped down from preaching to run for president don't don't do that folks ain't no way I'm in the highest office there isn't a land I don't care what the President says about it the House and Senate and all of them they're under my control you say they are I said yeah because that's what the Bible says they'll be into my ways why because my Bible says I'm in charge because I'm a shovel not just an animal that's a soul that you can't see other than my manifestation amen 104 in the red book 104 in the red book anybody have a knee take on these things what is man important is wrong sit down to bring that impossibility into effect but somebody got it said it's gonna have to get it set in their mind what's it here for we got a purpose this is not the ages gone by this is the purpose to face death and Destroy himself death is not the carnality of your mind but don't break that 40 years ago there's a carnality of your mind that's what's killing me Jesus my mind said we can't do it take over America he can change money what are you what do you believe foreign think about it Phil he wants to fellowship with you please what about heavenly father I am appreciate I words peace so we'll take us here he said if he can get that soul to stand stop for a little bit and considered his whole nature will die I love you take care of everybody and give us an understanding of you help us to realize who we are and what we're doing here what's the purpose and what what we really are Lord of what is man made in the image of his makers the Lord just come and workable man bring us to the place that we need to be take care of the people on the highway bless each one be with the sick ones and have your way in Jesus name foreign foreign
