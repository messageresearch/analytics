TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and before we uh look into the study this morning let's just all bow our heads speak to the author Heavenly Father we thank you for another day Lord you've given us or another time that you've allowed us to come to your house and gather with those of light precious faith and we just pray that you bless the service today Lord just bless each part of it Lord those that couldn't be with us this morning Lord those that are sick and Afflicted Lord you know each each need we just pray that you'll be with them Lord just help us this morning Lord to get ourselves out of the way that Lord you may have the preeminence Lord bless our for wayes Who Comes to bring the word to us today Lord just bless each part or we just commit all things to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen U this morning I want to look at um top of uh salvation and what it means to be saved and um kind of some of the things that goes with that and U our scripture reading is 2 Samuel 22 uh 1 through3 and David is speaking here it says and David spake unto the Lord the words of this song in the day that the Lord had delivered him out of the hand of his of all of his enemies and out of the hand of Saul and he said the Lord is my rock and my Fortress and my deliverer the god of my rock in him will I trust he is my shield and the Horn of my salvation my high tower and my refuge My Savior thou savest me from violence and uh you know um when we look at what it means to what salvation is what it means to be saved and in the in the message court trial brother Brown speaking here he says he said like we claim to be saved he said they say well show me how you're saved my life proves I'm saved the way I act proves whether I'm saved or not no matter how much I testify about it here you'll know how I how I live whether I'm saved or not he talks goes on brother R's talking about um healing he says you accept it on the same basis as you do your healing it's by faith and he goes on he talks about now the word Soo in the Greek means to be saved and so you know you're saved he said it's just like materially saved or spiritually saved you're saved [Music] Soo and he talks about people in the Bible that uh the woman at the whale I'm sorry the woman that had the issue of blood he was talking about her and said your sa your faith has saved thee he said he saved her from a premature grave just the same as same as he saved you from Hell Soo the same Greek word means to be saved thy faith has Soo saved thee from sickness and so the word Soo is one of things I want to I want to look at today and you know when you look at the word to it means to be saved it means to be to rescue to deliver to heal or to make whole and it means to also means to protect to keep alive preserve life or be made whole to rescue or deliver from danger or harm to preserve or Guard from injury destruction or loss so when you when people talk about being saved um you know people people just want to be saved because they don't want to go to hell but they don't want all the aspects of what it means to be saved and a lot of people they don't understand what it means to be saved because you know um when you when you understand a lot of people think when you in a way of looking at Salvation people act like you know we owe a debt we could not pay we owed a debt but that debt was life or death it's not like we owe a bill it's not like you just owe somebody money and it's like well somebody paid that bill for you no it was a it was a life or death situation and so you know it's when you when you're facing that and somebody delivers you from that just like brother Brandon was talking about the man that was in the river and he was talking about you know you got to get the man out of of the river and then you got to get the river out of the man so so there was a because when you look at being it says to rescue well when you talking about pulling somebody out you have to realize that you're in danger the kind of situation you were in because when you look at the situation that Adam and Eve was in Adam and Eve was in a is in the perfect sit environment perfect situation here they are in in G of Eden everything's perfect there's no problems but brother Brenham said because of the choice that they made they had a choice to make he said they wanted they wanted to know what it was like to have wisdom because they wanted to understand something that God hadn't brought them to yet and so they got outside the plan of God well here they are they're in danger well the next thing you know they fall there's this great Chasm between them and God there's a way that they can't get back brother said they lost the eternal life the access to eternal life here they are in the garden this great place everything's perfect but now they're in danger this situation this great chasms between them and God they're they're they have fallen from the condition that God put them in because of their own their own fault right because of their own desires and here he is and he said see they lost their claims on on eternal life in their flesh and he said see here they are and he said the only way that keeps you and I from dying is that we have to have the same eternal life we're in the same condition and you brother R talks about that you know we see that they were in there because of them believing a false word it led to their death because here was God everything don't partake of this tree everything else in the midst is good for you but there's this one thing that you've got to stay away from this tree of knowledge it's not for you but that's what was but that's what they were drawn to the serpent came to talk to Eve about what God had said well she should have known right then as well surely surely God won't let you die right well have you considered this tree have you considered this tree God said stay away from it that should have that should have sealed the deal right then that should that should have cleared it all up and it's like you know we don't even want to get close to that wein got time to talk about that God said St away from it but see then when she began to listen to to the Serpent's reasoning oh this is great look how wonderful it is then all of a sudden see then she got into a place where she was listening to the Serpent's lie and she began to partake of that when she should have stayed away from it see they had and it's the same way with you and I we have to realize the condition that we're in because of the Fall we were all put in that condition all mankind all creation fail so here we are today brother bam said you know he said well we want to blame Adam and Eve for the fall you know it's all their fault no it's your fault right this morning life and death lays before you your choice is to between life and death you have to decide whether you're going to accept this or not right because God judged Adam and Eve but today he judges you and I on our choice life and death lays before each one of us today and and it's our choice whether we're going to accept it or not and so when you when you look at this as you see the condition because many people don't see that because that's the LIE of the devil because people don't realize the condition that they're in because you know if if you see the danger just like brother talking about you know you see somebody that's going over the falls you know they're they're facing the falls and you're out there trying to tell them listen you just can't go out there and tell them now listen buddy your brother you're getting too close to the falls you know there's D no he said you'd be out there screaming and yelling if you could you get a hold of them and drag them out right you got time you ain't got time because if you see the danger there you ain't got time to talk to them and try to convince them you'd want to get them out just like he was talking about your child playing in the road if you saw him out there in the road you know you just don't go out there and say well Junior dear I think you shouldn't be doing that well you know it's like like me Richard I get to preach on Richard I get talk about Richard on I told him I said if you ever done this you can talk about me but he don't get to but you know when I was little you know Richard had me putting rocks on the yellow lines in the middle of the highway but you know I didn't see the danger which I don't even I I don't hardly even remember this but brother but Brother Richard Douglas's dad brother Joe he saw me he saw the danger and you know he didn't he didn't have he didn't have shoes on or nothing but he saw me out there in the middle of the road and Paul Paul just come run as hard as he could and scoop me up out of the road and took me home but you know it wasn't it wasn't that he you know because he didn't come out there and try to talk to me or nothing he just saw the danger and the first thing was he reacted to it to get me out of the out of the way and sometimes you know because God comes to us in our situation sometimes because you know we're just we're unknowledgeable we don't see the danger we're ignorant of the things that are around us right right but see that's the reason he comes to to bring us to the word to brings us to a knowledge of these things to understand listen God wants us to follow him to you know it's like sometimes like well I don't understand why things happen the way they do or whatever it's like trust God he's got your best interest at heart it's and you know you see and you look back over the things of life and and it's like well you know I wasn't I wasn't smart enough to figure that out on my own but you know I trusted God right God come along my path when I couldn't when I couldn't save myself and he was able to get me out of out of this situation and it's like you know what because because you know the Devil he's very shrewd he's he's very smart very intelligent and he knows what all our weaknesses are he knows what all our problems are and he knows how to work everything but I'm so glad I got one I can trust I can lean on I put my my confidence in him but many people you know they they just want they just want to have this um they just want to have to be saved but they don't want to but they don't want to entail take what it all entails because you know it's like well I just want as brother Brenham said here and we'll get to it maybe this morning but you know he talks about you know people want to be saved but they don't want a lord they they just they want salvation because they want to be saved from something but you know if you but you see you if you if you if you look at Salvation you know when when you talk to people it's like you you see people that need to be saved and and you're and you're trying to tell them listen this is you need to be saved and you you see the condition they in and people say well I I I don't know what to do about this and it's like listen if you if you get a savior you know then he can he can lead and guide you in these things but you you got to start somewhere you know and just like there in the in the book of Acts when when they began to speak in in Acts chapter two there when when Peter and the and the disciples were there and you know when in the day of Pentecost had fully come and then when the Holy Ghost had fallen on the on the people on the 120 and you know they began to act very odd and you know they come out into the street and everybody's trying to figure out you know who are these people and why are they acting this way and you know they thought well these people are full of new wine they're just drunk and you know it's like you know we still these drunk people in the middle of the day and you know every it become a spectacle but you know Peter stood up with the 11 and and he said he said ye men of Judea and all that dwell at Jerusalem he said be this known unto you and hearken unto my words for these are not drunken as you suppose sing that but it is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel and he said it shall come to pass in the last day saith God I will pour out my my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and on my servants and on my handmaidens will I pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy so here he goes when he's begin to speak of these things that was taking place and he takes them back to the Old Testament and began to show what was going to take place and then right after this we see that Peter drops down he says and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved and so people say well you know we just call upon the name of the Lord but the you know right after that he begins to speak and he says ye men of Israel hear these words Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God among you by whom Miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you as you yourselves also know so when he comes in there and he says but who calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved but the next thing that is right after that the first thing he does is Peter turns around and points him right back to Jesus and he begins to tell them all the scripture about the things that David had written in in the Psalms and was begin to talk about what what the word that was written of Jesus Christ and how Jesus Christ in his life he fulfilled exactly what was prophesied of him to do and he began to show them the hour and the day that they lived because the word was what brought them to that place to show them what was taking place and this is the Fulfillment of Joel because it's the outpouring because it was the promise of the scripture the Messiah has come and the life that he lived will now come upon the believer and he says then and he says when he begins to speak of that in verse 36 he says therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus whom ye have crucified ified both Lord and Christ so he begins to identify who his who he is the position the prophecy of the word that's taking place because this spectacle is taking place but it's the Fulfillment of word of the word of God and he says he said now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and they said unto Peter and to the rest of the disciples men and Brethren what shall we do then Peter said unto them just believe hu we just just believe on well that's what that's what he said up here he said he said whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved but it took more than that just we just we just believe on the Lord and and that gives us salvation but no if you if you continue in the word right because that's what that's what he said in John he said if you continue in my word he said then you're my disciples indeed right right he said then you'll know the truth and the truth will set you free so you got to continue in that so he said well because I I was listening to this man talking about um you know I don't know if y'all if y'all ever heard this term or not but um if y'all have ever heard the term lordship salvation but uh we may get into that uh I'm supposed to speak Wednesday night so we may get into a little bit of that on Wednesday Lord but um when you when you see this you know because when you look at salvation Salvation is not just one this this one part and it's like well you're being free from something no there's more there's more involved in Salvation than just just this you know being free from something I've been saved but you there's there because you don't understand the full scope of what that means so here when they when you're talking about calling on the name of the Lord shall be saved and when he began to preach the word Peter says you've got to repent right so what does that mean you've got to change the way you think the way you look at things right you because brother R said you got to make a a total change in your life to repent of the things that that you were and so when you say when it what does it mean to repent it means to change it me you because I I I want to change my ways I want I realize because when you realize listen I'm not where I need to be and I am I'm insufficient to do the things that I have to do I have to have somebody to Lead Me amen I've got to have somebody to pull me out right when you come to the realization because you know if like that man was drowning in the river well if he could get himself out he wouldn't be drowning right but when he come to realization that he needed somebody then somebody could come and help him just like just like brother R talking about people that you you try to show people that you know because of the situation that they're in it's like spiritually they're naked they're they're inadequate and it's like well you just tend to your own Affairs well if you saw somebody walking down the street you know they're not in their right mind cuz they ain't got their clothes on right and you try to go and help them like brother R said well you just you just take care of your own business because you've got to realize that you're not in the right place and you got to realize the danger that you're in because you tell people listen you're not we're not promised the rest of the day that's right we're not we're not we're not promised tomorrow brother R said if we woke up this morning you know we' to outlive a lot of kids a lot of teenagers there's a there's a lot of kids that won't make it through the day we're not promised tomorrow and if you and salvate today is the day of salvation if you plan on being right with God today the day to do that amen it's like well I'll take care of that no you ain't got time to take care of it later right when you come to the place of realizing you've got to be right with God because you don't have another day you don't know if you're going to draw another breath when you when you come to the realiz ation of how close it how serious it is that you've got to be saved that you've got to know that you know that you know you've got to you've got to have everything because when like brother said when you get to the river you don't want to have no River trouble you don't have no no problems crossing the river you don't want to get down there and think oh well you know because the preacher or or somebody said that I that I was okay you've got to know that for yourself there's not anybody else because that's between you and God and nobody else can tell you that that that you're okay see when you when you have you if you repent he said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost he said for the promise is unto you and to your children and to them that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God show shall call see when you have to understand see this is from the message proving his word says see a lot of people he said see a lot of people want Jesus to be their savior but not their lord see Lord is ruler yeah you say Jesus you saved me and let me stand right here and that's all right and I'll do my own business now you don't get in my business but you can be my savior but my but not my Lord he said he wants to be your lord you see then he's your savior so if you want a savior you've got to have a lord right because that's the only way that it works because as we were talking about the men drowning in the river you know the the if anybody's ever looked at you know been lifeguard or U people that do that kind of work you know you've got to get people to when when you're a lifeguard and you jump in and you're trying to save somebody if you're doing a water rescue and you're in there trying to get somebody you got to get that person to cooperate with you right because if they are uncooperative because if they're just fling in the water and they're panicking you can't save them right amen because you know you can give them you can give them your Flo of us and you tell them to H but you know what if they get a hold of you and they're not calm and they don't have confidence in you they'll drown you you can't save them so the thing is is you've got to get to the place where you have confidence in this person that you hey I can I can get you out and you got to you got to want to if anybody's everever been in that situation where you know you're you're down below the water and you're trying to get out and you can't breathe and you're ready to get you any anybody you just tell me what to do when we'll do it I'll cooperate with you you know you have to have but you got to be in that situation where you want to right and see when you when you're able to do that you give then the Lifeguard when he gets in the water then he can help you and many times it's like listen all you got to do is rest and relax amen and trust in him and then you know what that person can get you out and then all of a sudden you know they you hanging on and all of a sudden they're doing they're doing the work they get you out because they know what they're doing it's like lots of times people get caught in rip ties it's like well I'm a good swimmer I think I can do this until you get in water that's faster than you stronger than you right and people don't know how to get out because they'll go the wrong way because they think well I I'm just going to go in this direction but the only way there's but if you're going to get out of a rip tide what you got to go perpendicular to the force if it's pulling you on way you got to try to get out because many people they want to go the opposite direction and that's not going to work but see if you if you know those things but you got to know what direction to get out you see if if somebody's there to help you then they can get you in the right direction but you've got to have somebody that can show you to do that and I'm I want I want to finish with this this is from Romans chapter 10 verse 11 says for the scripture sayith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed he said for there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek for the same Lord over all is Rich unto all that call upon him for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved how then shall they call on him in who they have not believed how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher amen and how shall they preach except they be sent at is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring Glad Tidings of good things he said but they have not all obeyed the gospel for Isaiah sayith Lord who hath believed our report so then Faith cometh by by hearing and hearing by the word of God so when we see this scripture here see you have to hear the word and somebody has to bring you the word and who can if you don't hear the word then how can you believe right and somebody's got to be sent to bring the word to you and you've got to hear the word and believe the Worden and so it takes it takes the the word being spoken and so somebody's got to come and bring the word to you for you to understand and believe the word faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God and so we understand that if we see that the word has come then it's for us to believe it right and thank God we have a Ministry that brings the word to us but you know but like brother B said you know if you can't preach a sermon then live a sermon and that's what God wants us to do we are we're that living breathing instrumentality of Jesus Christ showing the world who Jesus Christ is not some idea not what what somebody else thinks but a real true living experience of Jesus Christ because you know there's a lot that can be spoke on and we'll have the musicians will come now you know there's a lot of people that want to talk about a lot of things but you know what you can't you can't argue with a life lived when you see that true experience cuz and that's what that's what people they may might argue the scripture but they can't when they see a life lived when they see a true experience and that's what that's what my desire is to see to show people that we people can see Jesus Christ in us not just some idea that they may see Jesus Christ in all of us amen well God bless you this morning [Applause]
