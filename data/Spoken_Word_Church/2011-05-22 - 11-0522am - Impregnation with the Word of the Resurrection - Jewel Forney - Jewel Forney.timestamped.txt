[44:35] looking to certain way out here right

[46:16] May me seated one
[46:23] moment thank the Lord for the reading of
[46:25] the word of God this morning
[46:27] amen and we went back to the scripture
[46:30] here and Marth was a we know the story
[46:34] how that they had sent a message to
[46:36] Jesus and and Jesus did not come before
[46:40] 4 days H in other words Jesus did not
[46:44] get in no haury he did not get he did
[46:47] not get all the out of been out of shap
[46:50] by it he did not let pressure or
[46:52] oppression get in his way H he waited
[46:55] for 4 days before he came down and and
[46:59] visit mon them about about the the
[47:02] message he had got about Lazarus but
[47:05] when Jesus came he had a reason for
[47:08] waiting for days he didn't just in other
[47:11] words it was some reason why Jah did not
[47:14] get there on the third day because Jah
[47:17] knew the traditions of the Jews and he
[47:20] knew that the Jews believe that the
[47:23] spirit of of the spirit linger run the
[47:26] body for 3 days and if jetah would have
[47:29] did it I call they would have say his
[47:31] Spirit was still there but jetah would
[47:33] to 4 days he broke that tradition then
[47:37] he came then he called for the
[47:39] resurrection now they look back to the
[47:41] tradition and say well this Spirit was
[47:43] right in the body no it was the fourth
[47:46] day the spirit already left the body how
[47:48] do so they and Jesus came Jesus came and
[47:51] Jesus said here Jesus called Lazarus out
[47:53] of the Grave Lazarus come forth I knew M
[47:56] was believeing there but M could not
[47:58] believe in a present day
[48:01] Resurrection right I had a
[48:04] title I'm going to take from there this
[48:08] morning impregnation amen with the word
[48:12] of Resurrection Hallelujah in other
[48:14] words if you're going to be raised you
[48:16] got to already be pregnated with it
[48:18] that's right hall everything going in
[48:20] word god a't going to have an unpregnant
[48:22] bride how you say my brother Jew you say
[48:24] you in Word what you trying to say I'm
[48:26] going to say this I said God going to
[48:28] have a bride that going to bring forth h
[48:30] a
[48:31] resurrection that why he takes it back
[48:33] to the Book of Romans and he says here
[48:36] if the Same Spirit had raised Christ
[48:39] from the dead H if you all got that same
[48:42] spirit in you you are pregnated how to
[48:45] take a resurrection if the same spirit
[48:48] that raised Christ from the dead if it
[48:50] dwell in you your body Hallelujah H your
[48:54] death in your body hallah cannot hold
[48:56] you back H in other words he if the sa
[49:00] to raise him from the dead if it dwell
[49:02] in you it will quick your Mor body
[49:05] Hallelujah and all death got to turn
[49:07] loose Hall high blood pressure got to
[49:09] turn loose sugar diabetes got to turn Lo
[49:12] how you going to be
[49:14] changed we thank God for that this
[49:17] morning Resurrection the impregnation
[49:20] and resurrection and I begin to took it
[49:22] and I took us off from here because when
[49:24] Jesus coming Jesus is is coming back for
[49:26] one thing he said when I come shall I
[49:29] find faith in the earth fa God something
[49:34] floating right here in the M way in the
[49:37] faith in the earth God himself how see a
[49:40] bride pregnant it with himself the only
[49:43] thing that God respond Faith how without
[49:46] Fai is impossible to please him how so
[49:48] when God come shall I find somebody they
[49:51] can respond back to me come on brother
[49:54] amen amen right Hallelujah now here we
[49:57] find him we going to De talking on
[50:01] impregnation so I'm tell from The Book
[50:03] of Mark and reason I because when Jesus
[50:06] came Hallelujah if we know the story
[50:09] here Mark 11 and I believe it was when
[50:12] Jesus Jesus uh Mark 11 and when Jesus
[50:16] came down here he seen a fig tree right
[50:19] H when Jesus wanted to draw virtal he
[50:22] wanted to the Bible say he was hungry
[50:25] and he wanted to pull Virg from this fig
[50:28] tree H Jesus walking down the road he
[50:31] can see a fall and no doubt he begin to
[50:34] get happy he's oh man is the time I can
[50:36] just get me one of juy fix H and I can
[50:39] and I can and I can pull some scrip from
[50:42] it but the Bible said when Jesus got to
[50:44] the Fig Tree the Fig Tree didn't have no
[50:48] fruit I don't care when God come H he
[50:51] going to be looking for some evidence
[50:53] Hallelujah in other words got to be
[50:56] something that God can identify with
[50:59] when Jesus got to the tree the tree was
[51:01] in the Earth the tree had the Earth the
[51:05] tree had rain the tree had the Sun but
[51:08] it didn't have no
[51:10] fruit Jesus said tree is known by fruit
[51:13] so how can there be a resurrection
[51:15] without the fruit of
[51:17] Resurrection so Jesus himself he came to
[51:20] the tree and he seen the tree with no
[51:22] fruit on it how did Jesus say i c you no
[51:26] man can eat from you from this day part
[51:28] and he went on and he went on up to
[51:30] Jerusalem did what he had to do then the
[51:32] say a few days later they turned back to
[51:35] the train Peter mind was
[51:39] quickened Peter says in him the tree
[51:43] that the master curs on is the W away
[51:46] Hallelujah why did Peter do this what
[51:48] made it come back to Peter because Peter
[51:51] was pregnated with Resurrection it was
[51:53] something in Peter that Peter didn't
[51:55] even know he had he had it in him and it
[51:58] brought it back to his remance he
[52:00] remembered the thought of God and when
[52:02] he remember the thought of God Peter
[52:04] said the tree is C how do God brought it
[52:07] back to remember the same Revelation
[52:09] that told Peter God Christ Living
[52:13] God that's right talking about
[52:15] Resurrection pregnation with Revelation
[52:18] pregnation with Resurrection the word
[52:21] resurrection mean to rise up if you got
[52:24] a revelation if it's not bringing you
[52:26] closer to God of rising you up you got
[52:29] the wrong Revelation because your
[52:31] Revelation is not and know what people
[52:33] say find a lot of people that been in
[52:34] the message and it said and they going
[52:36] backward that Revelation that show that
[52:39] they never got pregnant with the word of
[52:41] God because if you got the resurrection
[52:44] in you you got a power in you so you can
[52:47] rise up you got to keep going forward
[52:50] how got to keep getting you closer to
[52:52] God how people fire here a lot of time
[52:54] they say what I'm
[52:56] predestinated I am predestinated brother
[52:59] I can do what I want to do if you
[53:01] predestinated I you doing what you want
[53:03] to do and you going back toward the
[53:05] world yeah going back to the world then
[53:08] you not showing the fruits of
[53:09] predestination because predestination
[53:11] mean I am predestinated to be conformed
[53:15] into the image of the Living God how my
[53:18] life is not going Bible but my life is
[53:21] rising up how T the image of God because
[53:24] when he he's looking for life that can
[53:27] meet his Revelation and that's by
[53:30] faith right I begin to look at him I'm
[53:33] going to read a quote from the from
[53:35] Christ the mystery God revealed and then
[53:38] kind of braing try to bring they bring a
[53:41] little light on my on the what I'm what
[53:44] I'm speaking on and he says here he says
[53:48] C me God reveal page 67 he said you
[53:51] cannot commit adultery right how do you
[53:54] can not commit adultery you already
[53:58] pregnated right so now he putting it
[54:00] there and what would he doing this he
[54:03] that you cannot commit D you already
[54:05] pregnated Glory he cannot how can he
[54:08] take a hold the wound of life is closed
[54:11] to anything else you already by
[54:14] predestinated that seed has come to life
[54:18] and no world can get in how many people
[54:22] would you get the baptism of the Holy
[54:24] Ghost how pregnated with God he said no
[54:27] world can't get in how you what what I'm
[54:30] going do I've kept it by the I've kept
[54:32] it in this world how do you feel
[54:34] thepress of this world but the world
[54:36] cannot have no influence over your life
[54:39] because
[54:41] you you Lord oh Hallelujah we begin to
[54:44] look here took another one another quot
[54:48] spoke word to see and other words when
[54:50] you pregnant him and he say a woman
[54:53] that's and other when God come he got to
[54:55] find you how he got to find you he got
[54:58] to find this word punctuating through
[55:00] your life or else you not be able to
[55:02] race how not let me use the Rapture
[55:05] message this made the one of need he
[55:07] said Rapture message he say right here
[55:09] he said he said he was using St John the
[55:12] 15th chapter he said in St John the 15th
[55:14] chapter
[55:16] ever never plumed never plume the the
[55:20] the vine out he took the branches off
[55:24] and what he never cut the vine off right
[55:26] he took the branches off right and cut
[55:29] them out because they was not burn any
[55:32] fruit right that's what God is looking
[55:35] for a pregnated bride must have fruit
[55:39] how Jesus did not say you going to be
[55:41] known by by how good you how good you
[55:44] dress how he didn't say you going to be
[55:47] known by how much you run now he tree is
[55:50] known by his fruit all man shall know
[55:54] you that's right amen he says here he
[55:57] going to cut the branches off and cut
[56:00] the branches out of them because they
[56:02] they was he cut the branches cut the
[56:05] branches he no he cut the branches off
[56:08] them because they was not burn any fruit
[56:10] that's and we Jesus Jesus want fruit of
[56:15] Y for him for himself right his wife
[56:19] must bring forth the kind of children
[56:22] that he is and look what he is word
[56:25] right and that then if that does not
[56:28] bring forth he said then if it does not
[56:31] bring forth children bride children word
[56:35] children then then it's the denomination
[56:38] child in other word it's the wrong seed
[56:41] hallah when Adam got to Eve you listen
[56:44] here when Adam got to Eve she was
[56:47] already pregn it with the wrong seed H
[56:51] she already had defiled herself with the
[56:54] wrong seed
[56:56] when God when Joseph got to Mary Mary
[56:59] was already pregnant without see with
[57:02] the right SE with our
[57:06] sensation OHL what we got to get and
[57:09] that's why it is in this message when
[57:11] God come you got to have the right seat
[57:13] in you now the word spok word seat woman
[57:17] that's spouse you a woman just engage to
[57:19] a man yep to find a young clean man and
[57:25] before they come together she is found
[57:27] pregnated by somebody
[57:30] else the then her the her own seed which
[57:36] is betr to her her own body which is she
[57:41] be she betr to her boyfriend or engaged
[57:44] to her husband is found full of seed of
[57:47] another man what a disgrace hallelu when
[57:51] God come he's not looking for a
[57:53] denomination a bride he looking for
[57:56] bride that got the revelation of the
[57:58] word in her and they got power to be
[58:01] changed in a moment of the T the eye
[58:03] here what Jesus said if the same spirit
[58:06] that raised Christ from the dead if it's
[58:08] dwelling inside of you it will bring
[58:11] your body ever raise your body to
[58:13] another
[58:14] level amen begin to look at but you know
[58:17] we realize you we Bas as our Revelation
[58:20] in this message as I go around and I see
[58:24] what people put their uh emphasis on
[58:27] they put their emphasis on when I'm in
[58:29] the message oh yeah but the point that I
[58:31] put my emphasis on is the message in
[58:34] you with Fellowship by Redemption he
[58:37] said the branches bear fruit not the
[58:41] vine that's right the branches the vine
[58:43] only the energy in into it right the
[58:48] gospel can be preached by Christ but you
[58:52] open yourself up
[58:55] and be a branch that bear the fruit to
[58:58] bring for fruit right others can see
[59:01] Christ in you by your testimony others
[59:05] can see Christ because the evidence is
[59:08] that Christ in you somebody got to be
[59:10] able to know that you're pregnant right
[59:12] when a woman get pregnant she don't need
[59:15] sooner or later somebody going to know
[59:17] iide her husband in herself and God H
[59:21] and she stay and she stay pregnant it
[59:24] long enough the whole church going to
[59:26] know H it won't be nothing to H on it
[59:29] how you won't have to go and look at her
[59:31] how many mons you get when she get about
[59:33] seven8 month everybody going to know
[59:37] right he the words in the word that's
[59:39] say he testimony by the Life by your
[59:42] life and the way you live he is he is
[59:46] the energy but you show the picture you
[59:49] the walkin Bible right
[59:53] pregnation but we take
[59:55] well brother I've been in the message
[59:57] I've been hearing the message but have
[59:58] you become pregnant see because don't
[1:00:01] mean because you've been planet or been
[1:00:03] around the M it mean that you're
[1:00:05] pregnant I took it from St Matthew 13
[1:00:08] yeah look at St Matthew 13 for a
[1:00:12] minute cuz I want to know I'm I want to
[1:00:14] know not just because it fell because
[1:00:17] when the word fall everybody have a
[1:00:19] Revival the word brings a Revival but
[1:00:22] all in other word but the rain on the
[1:00:25] just and but only one seed that's in the
[1:00:27] ground that's got the fruit in of the
[1:00:29] right seed ever SE bring for out this so
[1:00:31] now go in here in in in in the book of
[1:00:34] St Matthew the 13th chapter I leave
[1:00:37] Verse 18 it says here he's talking in
[1:00:40] the parable he
[1:00:42] said here y therefore the parable of the
[1:00:46] sword Now watch how he put this when
[1:00:48] anyone he the
[1:00:50] what it was not a denomination right it
[1:00:54] was the people that was following the
[1:00:56] message but never went all the way amen
[1:01:00] when anyone hear the word of the Kingdom
[1:01:03] right and understanding it
[1:01:06] what that's what I'm going to stop for
[1:01:08] one second hold your place hold your
[1:01:11] place cuz I got this in here I've been

[1:01:45] to be subject to the word right just got
[1:01:47] to be take a word hand to bring your
[1:01:48] body to your word rev so we begin to

[1:03:15] you be all way over here lday way over
[1:03:17] here West today but we got to get
[1:03:20] back that's right he when you don't
[1:03:24] understand he says in the 19 when anyone
[1:03:26] hear the word of go of the kingdom and
[1:03:29] understand not then come the wicked one
[1:03:32] and catches away that which was sold in
[1:03:34] his what in his heart and that is he

[1:03:58] word and able with joy and receive it
[1:04:03] and yet having not what root it fell but
[1:04:07] it was no root right and if there's no
[1:04:10] root there's no fruit exactly how going
[1:04:13] to take because the fruit got to be in
[1:04:15] the vine the life is in the vine how you
[1:04:18] show if it falls in the ground how do it
[1:04:21] got to have something it it got to be in
[1:04:24] the right type of a
[1:04:26] revelation he said he have not Ru in
[1:04:29] himself but endure for what right how
[1:04:32] many people that been around this
[1:04:33] message yeah you seen them Rejoice all
[1:04:36] over the church H then the little trials
[1:04:38] and little thing begin to creep up may
[1:04:40] think you know you ain't seen him in two
[1:04:41] years what it is he heard the word but
[1:04:44] there was no root to hold
[1:04:47] it he do it for a while but when
[1:04:49] tribulation and persecution arises
[1:04:51] because of the word by and by He Is
[1:04:53] offended
[1:04:55] and then he go say he that also
[1:04:57] receiveth seed among Thorns every one of
[1:05:01] these Revival had a
[1:05:04] pregnation every one of the revivals had
[1:05:06] a seed to fa a word Revival but the
[1:05:09] point of it was the earth that it fell
[1:05:11] in was not good ground because if it
[1:05:14] would have been good ground it would
[1:05:15] have broke forth but see every one of
[1:05:17] them had a word Revival and every one of
[1:05:20] them had something that moved it but the
[1:05:22] lay see a right here how so the seed
[1:05:26] fail the word fail for this Edge right
[1:05:29] this is The Edge that more what is the
[1:05:32] greatest sin of this age is materialism
[1:05:36] Hallelujah so he said he receive SE
[1:05:38] among Thorns is he that hear the word
[1:05:41] and he that hear the word had ear to
[1:05:44] hear and the chaos of this world and the
[1:05:48] deceitfulness of riches everybody want

[1:11:16] off the field for a few months to get
[1:11:18] myself together
[1:11:22] again
[1:11:28] you people go through this false label
[1:11:31] right false conception because they in
[1:11:34] the message they think well all you got
[1:11:38] to do is B the message you say I you
[1:11:40] better receive the Holy
[1:11:42] Ghost exactly and I begin to look here
[1:11:46] we need to find some false evidence in
[1:11:48] of a some woman some spiritually
[1:11:51] speaking he said because a woman typed
[1:11:53] the church
[1:11:54] how do we need to find some spiritual
[1:11:55] evidence of somebody that thought they
[1:11:58] were
[1:11:58] pregnant because they seen the signs you
[1:12:02] know some women they want to be pregnant
[1:12:04] so bad they take all kind of tests and
[1:12:06] they feel a few months they'll get all
[1:12:08] excited I believe I got it just then
[1:12:10] they take a test and they say no and the
[1:12:12] body would seem to went through all
[1:12:14] these cycles and seem to be that way
[1:12:16] then they go take the test is not
[1:12:17] nothing H so in word so in word brother
[1:12:21] you got to take a test it's the word
[1:12:24] test because that's the only thing that
[1:12:26] can determine if you pregnant or not
[1:12:29] hallel in other words you're the word
[1:12:31] test you don't receive it he know well I
[1:12:34] come to him and Adam put a seed in e no
[1:12:37] it ain't that way you got to receive it
[1:12:39] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost it
[1:12:41] ain't nobody put a SE in you if you got
[1:12:43] a SE to you God put it there he born of
[1:12:47] God cannot commit sin because his
[1:12:50] SE remain in you so
[1:12:53] to go here so I begin to looking for
[1:12:55] evidence of a church that thought they
[1:12:58] was pregnant yeah and I went over here
[1:13:01] and I found one in St Matthew the 7th
[1:13:06] chapter St Matthew the 7th
[1:13:09] chapter and I begin to look for a woman
[1:13:13] that had thought they were had they was
[1:13:17] pregnant a church that thought they had
[1:13:19] a
[1:13:21] Revival St Matthew the 7th chap
[1:13:24] verse
[1:13:24] 19 and it says every tree that bringeth
[1:13:28] not forth
[1:13:30] what good fruit is hang down and cast
[1:13:34] into the V what about there fruit you
[1:13:37] should what so now the evidence is by
[1:13:41] fruit right Hallelujah the evidence is
[1:13:44] fruit righten then he goes on and says
[1:13:47] everyone that says unto me Lord Lord
[1:13:49] shall not enter the kingdom the shall
[1:13:51] not enter the kingdom of heaven but he
[1:13:53] that does the will of My Father which is
[1:13:54] in heaven for many with many will say to
[1:13:57] me in that day Lord Lord have not we
[1:13:59] prophesied in thy name and in thy name
[1:14:02] cast out devils and in thy name done
[1:14:04] many wonderful work and I will profess
[1:14:06] on them I never knew you I never knew
[1:14:10] you heing me yeah that working a n what
[1:14:14] was wrong that was no impregnation but
[1:14:16] that was sign that's
[1:14:18] right that was signs of pregnation
[1:14:21] because they seen these things
[1:14:23] and they begin to look at the sign and
[1:14:25] not look at the person right what it
[1:14:29] don't bother me when some man get up and
[1:14:31] say I believe the world going end
[1:14:32] because them just signs you got to have
[1:14:35] evidence of you pregnant all these don't
[1:14:37] move to R it up how guy come up here and
[1:14:40] say October he going to do here and
[1:14:42] going to be a r here I'm not even wor

[1:14:48] only thing I I see I want to know that
[1:14:51] Christ is on inside of me something
[1:14:54] my my to change it do this
[1:14:59] myself so now we got to find this lady M
[1:15:03] see what's wrong y on because Jesus says
[1:15:06] here a tree is known by his fruit right
[1:15:10] right now we got to find what she's
[1:15:12] going through these label pains in the
[1:15:14] scripture right these labor pains these
[1:15:18] false pains that making her think that
[1:15:20] she's pregnant right yeah making her
[1:15:23] she's already to receive the seed of the
[1:15:26] word we got to find something in here to
[1:15:29] find out where we at so we don't get to
[1:15:31] looking at where because I feel like I'm
[1:15:33] pregnant no you got to know that you're
[1:15:35] pregnant that's right I Mary knew my
[1:15:38] Revelation that she was pregnant because
[1:15:41] words in other words so you got to have
[1:15:43] a revelation I have got to baptis of the
[1:15:46] Holy Ghost that mean that no devil hell
[1:15:49] can take that out of
[1:15:50] you but I want to look at this false

[1:27:32] he didn't at this time it was still the
[1:27:34] seals he had broke this mystery yet
[1:27:36] right so now they can still say what is
[1:27:38] he talking about so they had one thing
[1:27:42] they had over on Jesus
[1:27:44] right his birth right they were denying
[1:27:48] that the birth was Supernatural they
[1:27:50] they that they denying that they have
[1:27:52] denied that the experience is
[1:27:54] Supernatural they tried to say we can
[1:27:56] get it by knowledge we can get it by
[1:27:58] this but you got to have a personal
[1:28:00] Supernatural experience with the Holy
[1:28:02] Ghost how you sure he says here didn't
[1:28:04] say they unto him will not be born of
[1:28:07] fornication that's
[1:28:09] right we have one father even
[1:28:13] God oh my we got something on you know
[1:28:16] you want to get to get attitude we'll
[1:28:17] let people know who you are child of the
[1:28:20] fornication yeah
[1:28:22] they couldn't got that in the word cuz
[1:28:24] it wouldn't in there if they would have
[1:28:26] went back to the word they would have
[1:28:27] seen is say
[1:28:28] Virg I don't know how they come over to
[1:28:31] Theory right but they were believeing it
[1:28:33] so now he go and say here he said he
[1:28:36] said then they said unto him we not be
[1:28:38] born of fornication Jesus said unto them
[1:28:41] if you were if y were God if if if if a
[1:28:47] question a question H I know you're not
[1:28:50] right H I'm not going to say that you're
[1:28:52] God children because if I speak the word
[1:28:55] you have to be that right oh yeah so he
[1:28:58] just put it you know is a question now
[1:29:01] it's something if you notice he answer
[1:29:04] this thing not direct he answer this
[1:29:05] thing with a you know if you were but I
[1:29:09] know you're not right so now he got to
[1:29:11] left them in the middle of the road so
[1:29:13] they still thinking they in the message
[1:29:15] he said he said if you were if you were
[1:29:18] if God were your father you would y
[1:29:21] would what love me love
[1:29:24] me cuz he knew that the devil cannot
[1:29:28] impersonate Divine love he knew that
[1:29:31] that love of God was in him the devil
[1:29:33] would not be able to impersonate he
[1:29:35] impersonate he said but I proceive forth
[1:29:38] I proceed forth and came from God need I
[1:29:40] came on myself but but he Des sent me
[1:29:42] and why do ye not understand my what
[1:29:46] because because you canot hear my word
[1:29:49] the evidence of being filled with the
[1:29:51] Holy Ghost the ability to hear God word
[1:29:54] how did Faith come by here and I hearing
[1:29:56] the word of
[1:29:58] God right so now he breaks the
[1:30:01] seals and show who they are it was an
[1:30:05] antichrist riding he was riding through
[1:30:07] the church he was Antichrist he was an
[1:30:09] but sooner or later he revealed who he
[1:30:11] was he showed in The Pale Horse who the
[1:30:13] Antichrist was R he said but y of your
[1:30:17] father the devil
[1:30:19] right but devil a strong piece of yeah
[1:30:22] oh yeah stus woman yeah have your father
[1:30:25] the devil in the lust of your father y
[1:30:27] will do he was a murder from the what
[1:30:30] beginning but not in the what truth and
[1:30:33] there is no what in him trth when he
[1:30:36] speak a li he speak of his own and he is
[1:30:39] a what liar and the what of it father
[1:30:42] that's why when they came to Jesus they
[1:30:44] was already pregnated with a lie right
[1:30:48] they was not pregnated with the word
[1:30:50] because this lie him been born in
[1:30:52] fornication had already took hold in
[1:30:54] their lives so that's why they couldn't
[1:30:56] receive the word because their wound was
[1:30:58] already cold to the r to the word when
[1:31:00] the word was revealed they were believe
[1:31:02] in a lie H they was they was they were
[1:31:05] raised under this message they come up
[1:31:08] but they just they was already pregnant
[1:31:10] with something come on you talk to
[1:31:13] somebody that pregnated in any false
[1:31:15] doctors around me perusers thund and all
[1:31:18] the things that they get in them you
[1:31:20] cannot talk to s that's right that's
[1:31:22] right brother tell right now this is
[1:31:25] what this is what we got to this is what
[1:31:27] my brother this is what so and so
[1:31:29] started right here this is what I
[1:31:30] believe they already pregnated with
[1:31:32] something else but if the bride is Jesus
[1:31:34] Christ if you pregnated with the word
[1:31:36] you always go back to the word I am
[1:31:39] pregnant with the Holy
[1:31:40] Ghost but the basic thing of it is they
[1:31:43] were
[1:31:44] chosen that's right people basic well I
[1:31:47] was chosen I know I'm part of it oh yeah
[1:31:50] I'm part of it I'm chosen of God
[1:31:52] so with Judas that's right Judas didn't
[1:31:55] come in Judas was chosen how but many
[1:31:58] are chosen how all the CH of Judah was
[1:32:02] chosen of God he was the type of those
[1:32:05] that heard the word and the the riches
[1:32:09] right and power right he was chosen to
[1:32:12] God the brother in the church but Judas
[1:32:15] himself he was chosen of God and he was
[1:32:18] disrupted in truth so that Judah Not
[1:32:20] only was he chosen he was the truth he
[1:32:22] shared the knowledge of the mystery he
[1:32:25] had the ministry of give of power
[1:32:26] granted unto him he he and he healed the
[1:32:29] SI he cast out devils in Jesus name but
[1:32:32] when The Showdown came he sold out H he
[1:32:36] sold out how for politics power he did
[1:32:39] not go up to Pentecost to receive the
[1:32:42] spirit of God Judah was already pregnant
[1:32:45] with God chose him come on you know what
[1:32:48] I think Jud was pregnated when God chose
[1:32:50] him right right he was already the child
[1:32:53] of the devil he was the mystery of the
[1:32:54] devil revealed when God chose him how
[1:32:57] you know because Jesus said in say John
[1:33:00] here say John 6 verse 17 he I have not I
[1:33:03] chosen you 12 and one of you is a devil
[1:33:06] right he knew who he was he was already
[1:33:09] believing the lie so now we got to go
[1:33:11] back to pray Hy you say what you trying
[1:33:14] to say brother so now you find out here
[1:33:16] if the pregnation that took place and
[1:33:18] ain't other word and you say pregn with
[1:33:20] the word of God if I pr with the word of
[1:33:23] God it got to be fruit to prove and
[1:33:25] Jesus said when all men know that you
[1:33:26] are my disciples right when all men will
[1:33:29] know that you are my disciple not when
[1:33:32] you have tongues right not when you
[1:33:34] shout right he said all man will know
[1:33:36] you my discip will you have love one for
[1:33:40] the other by this will all man know
[1:33:43] right long away from
[1:33:46] that we a long way from
[1:33:49] that you disagree with somebody you find
[1:33:51] out
[1:33:52] right oh yeah you you really find out
[1:33:54] you disagree right but in other words so
[1:33:58] so we got to go here we begin to realize
[1:33:59] here so we go to this we go to the thing
[1:34:02] right here so we begin to look here we
[1:34:04] say Lord you know what what what what
[1:34:06] what we looking for I tell you right
[1:34:07] here we going to prove what they pray
[1:34:10] with the people today what are they pray

[1:35:58] word yeah had the word pregnant you amen
[1:36:01] because coming to the word and having a

[1:36:13] for God in the word and for his people
[1:36:15] right and I begin to look here so when
[1:36:17] he got to Judah Judah was already
[1:36:19] pregnant with the already of the
