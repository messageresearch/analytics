[0:01] God bless you Saints it's good to be in
[0:03] the house of the Lord this
[0:08] morning we're on Hebrews
[0:11] 13 the last
[0:13] chapter and let's just go to the Lord in
[0:16] prayer Lord God we're so grateful to be
[0:17] able to gather together this morning
[0:19] around your word and Lord we've come
[0:21] expecting with expecting hearts Lord
[0:23] Jesus that you'll feed us this morning
[0:24] we just ask Lord that you'll give us the
[0:27] right attitude Lord Jesus and help us
[0:28] Lord to receive these things as we study
[0:30] these things out Lord God lord be with
[0:32] brother Wade as he's prepared and
[0:34] studying and laboring to bring us the
[0:36] word this morning grant us Lord that
[0:38] you'll be at Liberty to move Among Us
[0:40] this morning Lord we pray in your name
[0:44] amen now Hebrews 13 um when we as we
[0:49] kind of get into studying this out
[0:51] there's a lot of uh commentaries online
[0:53] if you people have studied these things
[0:55] and it it's kind of it looks a little
[0:58] bit odd how Paul
[1:00] it seem it would seem like Hebrews 12 is
[1:02] the close out of the book of Hebrews and
[1:04] then then it looks like Hebrews 13 is
[1:06] just kind of he covers a lot of things
[1:09] quickly and just kind of throwing a lot
[1:10] of things out there love one another and
[1:13] remember them that have the rule over
[1:14] you and uh we got to go beyond the camp
[1:17] and all these things kind of thrown out
[1:19] at once and some people say that that it
[1:22] looks like he uh you know um maybe a
[1:24] year or so after he wrote the book of
[1:26] Hebrews he just um he said I'm going to
[1:28] add this on at the end
[1:30] um but either way whatever whatever the
[1:32] case may be um it's part of the book of
[1:35] Hebrews and uh it starts out talking
[1:37] about we need to love one another so
[1:40] this morning I want to I want to just
[1:42] kind of focus on that um he said let
[1:45] brotherly love if we can say that right
[1:47] let Brotherly Love continue and verse
[1:50] two be not forgetful to entertain
[1:53] strangers for thereby some have
[1:55] entertained angels unawares right now
[1:58] there see he's continuing that thought
[2:00] let's be kind to one another be kind to
[2:03] a stranger cuz you never know when that
[2:06] stranger might be an angel somebody that
[2:09] can help you be be be let's let's love
[2:13] and he said remember them that are in
[2:15] bonds remember them that are going
[2:17] through something as though you're bound
[2:19] with them enter into that now see
[2:21] there's where you're really when you
[2:23] begin to enter in to the situations that
[2:26] people are going through and when you're
[2:27] praying you're thinking about them and
[2:30] empathizing with them that's what Paul
[2:33] is talking about and them which suffer
[2:35] adversity as being yourselves also in
[2:38] the
[2:39] body so Hebrew 13 we're we're just going
[2:42] to talk about brotherly love and
[2:44] continue I I've got this little
[2:45] scripture Leviticus 19:18 Thou shalt not
[2:48] avenge nor bear any grudge against the
[2:50] children of thy people but Thou shalt
[2:52] love thy neighbor as thyself so that's a
[2:54] promise or or or a an admonition all the
[2:57] way from the Old Testament to love your
[2:59] neighbor as yourself now you think about
[3:03] think about Brotherly Love um when we
[3:06] come to church what's really happening
[3:08] in the life of a Christian as you're
[3:10] hearing the word the word is planted in
[3:12] your life and you got uh you're you're
[3:15] born again and and you know we we've
[3:18] studied these things out that you start
[3:20] off with all of the things that are
[3:21] necessary for your journey you got 10
[3:24] fingers like a little baby 10 toes like
[3:26] a little baby and you begin to grow and
[3:27] grow and grow and push out so maybe your
[3:29] birth you've got you've got some some
[3:32] little bit of of of divine love that can
[3:35] be projected but what we've got to do is
[3:38] grow and grow and grow precept upon
[3:40] precept until it's sealed in so it's
[3:42] constant it's consistent day by day when
[3:46] life throws things at you you're
[3:48] responding with love and kindness in the
[3:51] in the correct way I think honestly this
[3:54] is one of the most difficult things to
[3:56] preach with balance because one of the
[3:58] things you start talking about brotherly
[4:00] love and you go too far over to one side
[4:02] and you're looking at it like well um
[4:04] like a you're looking for a kind old
[4:06] priest which brother BR said we don't
[4:08] want a kind old priest that can you know
[4:10] maybe help help pay for your bills and
[4:13] and and do those sorts of things but yet
[4:15] won't tell you the truth I I I think
[4:17] kind kindness really if you look at it
[4:19] scripturally and Brotherly Love real
[4:21] Biblical brotherly love is like John the
[4:23] Baptist going out there and saying Herod
[4:25] you can't you you got a marriage
[4:27] situation or somebody telling the truth
[4:29] but so we got to have we got to have the
[4:31] right balance you can't go over on the
[4:33] other side either and say well we just
[4:35] don't need kindness anymore we don't
[4:37] need to treat one another with respect
[4:38] we don't need to uh empathize with one
[4:40] another you can't go that so you got to
[4:42] right right down the middle of the road
[4:44] right straight and that's why it's so
[4:47] hard to to to articulate these things
[4:50] correctly and brother R said and I will
[4:52] restore he said now the first thing that
[4:54] Pentecost produced was Brotherly Love
[4:57] now you think about that what a
[4:59] statement the first thing that Pentecost
[5:00] produced was brotherly love it tore down
[5:02] the middle wall of partitions and made a
[5:04] Brotherhood to such such a way that they
[5:07] had everything in common in the Bible
[5:09] Days A brotherhood Paul spoke of this
[5:12] Brotherhood and he gave all the gifts of
[5:13] the Pentecostal church and then said in
[5:16] 1 Corinthians 13 that though I speak
[5:19] with tongues as men and angels and have
[5:22] not this love which brings the
[5:25] Brotherhood I am nothing and though I
[5:28] have the knowledge to understand
[5:29] understand all the mysteries of God I am
[5:31] still nothing without love the love of
[5:34] the
[5:35] Brethren now you you think about that if
[5:39] you if you go to tell somebody all the
[5:41] Mysteries that you understand and but
[5:43] yet it's lacking love in your heart and
[5:44] you don't really care about that brother
[5:46] you just care more about sharing the
[5:48] information that you have you see it
[5:51] that's what he's saying it it just
[5:52] without love everything just begins to
[5:54] fall apart you're you're trying to share
[5:56] somebody the gospel how can you really
[5:58] share the the gospel effectively if they
[6:01] don't see kindness and love and know
[6:03] that they that you care about their
[6:04] their soul and see that's where you
[6:06] really you getting up into Brotherly
[6:08] Love Brotherly Love is looking past all
[6:10] the little faults and problems that
[6:11] somebody has down in the inside of that
[6:14] person is is if they're born again is
[6:17] something well even if you're not born
[6:20] again you've got a soul that's worth
[6:22] 10,000 worlds and if you're born again
[6:24] that's God down on the inside so even
[6:26] you know you want to you want to put
[6:28] that in the right place too that your
[6:30] your brother is got God enthroned on
[6:32] their heart and so you want to respect
[6:35] them and so you're looking at that you
[6:36] begin to look at things differently
[6:39] because of the love of God being
[6:41] projected let's let's read what Paul
[6:42] what brother R was referring to in 1
[6:44] Corinthians 13 He said though I speak
[6:46] with the tongues of men and of angels
[6:48] and have not charity or love I am become
[6:50] a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol so
[6:54] if you speak with tongues and you got a
[6:55] gift and you're and the Lord's moving in
[6:58] your life and supernaturally but you
[6:59] don't have love then what good is that
[7:01] it's like you're just going over to that
[7:03] symbol there and just blang on it bling
[7:04] bling bling bling bling because it's you
[7:06] there's no love love is what love is
[7:10] what love is what keeps everything
[7:12] together it's that's that's and he said
[7:14] though I have the gift of Prophecy and
[7:16] understand all Mysteries and all
[7:17] knowledge and though I have all Faith so
[7:19] that I could remove mountains and have
[7:21] not charity I am nothing and though I
[7:24] bestow all my goods to feed the poor and
[7:26] though I give my body to be burned and
[7:27] have not charity it profiteth mean
[7:29] nothing now you see why see why love is
[7:32] so so difficult to articulate correctly
[7:34] cuz sometimes you know maybe your mind
[7:37] immediately goes when you start talking
[7:38] about love well love is corrective and
[7:39] it starts going down that path love is
[7:42] many things so that's what we want to
[7:44] meditate on this morning love is love is
[7:46] more than just grabbing Somebody by the
[7:47] collar and saying you're going to do it
[7:48] this way there's there's there's a lot
[7:50] of things that go into love love is
[7:53] being kind to one another love is
[7:54] respecting one another's boundaries love
[7:56] is respecting thinking about what how
[7:59] somebody's going to perceive the way
[8:01] that you present the gospel and trying
[8:03] to trying to win that person
[8:05] over love is all those things now
[8:08] brother R said in pmer worm glus korm
[8:10] caterpillar he said the next thing that
[8:11] we'd like to say for is brotherly love
[8:14] has been eaten away from the vine
[8:16] Brotherly Love Jesus said this will all
[8:17] men know you're my disciples when you
[8:21] have love one for another oh you think
[8:23] about what a weighty statement that is
[8:24] that that's how people will know that
[8:27] you are Christian because of your love
[8:29] right well now let's just look at an
[8:31] example if a man don't believe the same
[8:33] as I do I'll go right into his
[8:35] congregation and preach with him just
[8:37] preach what he believes and go right
[8:39] ahead and let it go because I love him
[8:42] now what let's let's pause let's think
[8:44] about that if God if if there's a
[8:47] Believer that's really born again and if
[8:50] they're if they're wrong God if if they
[8:52] just continue on we've got a promise in
[8:54] the Bible that the spirit of truth will
[8:56] lead and guide us into all truth so
[8:59] there thereby we can have confidence
[9:01] that the same God that has led us to the
[9:02] truth if they're born again and they
[9:05] just keep keep pressing on that same God
[9:07] cuz God promised it will lead and guide
[9:10] them to the truth just the way that he
[9:11] led us to the truth so there you can
[9:14] look past all the little differences and
[9:16] things and just love them and try to
[9:18] help them along maybe give them some
[9:20] words of encouragement uh and and not be
[9:22] so quick to push the other person out
[9:24] and say Well they're not they're not
[9:26] part of it by their fruits you know that
[9:29] he said if they don't believe it and
[9:30] they haven't got Brotherly Love they
[9:32] drop out disagree fall away I have
[9:34] nothing to do with it if if they haven't
[9:35] got Brotherly Love see we want to look
[9:38] past all the little the little things
[9:40] that people say to us and just keep
[9:41] pressing on why don't you come to me and
[9:43] talk to me about it he said you don't
[9:45] know what I believe see what difference
[9:46] does it make anyhow what I believe it's
[9:50] who I believe Jesus Christ now that's
[9:54] that's kind of a statement to meditate
[9:55] on he's saying it matters more who I
[9:58] believe then what I believe cuz if
[10:01] you're looking at Jesus Christ and not
[10:04] the minister behind the pulpit not one
[10:06] another if you're looking at Jesus
[10:08] Christ and you're putting one foot in
[10:10] front of the other we're going to get
[10:12] there amen so you just love one another
[10:15] we're going to get there I've never left
[10:17] a meeting yet with a bad taste as I know
[10:19] of but you see brotherly love has been
[10:21] all discarded and Paul seen it 1
[10:23] Corinthians 13 He said let Brotherly
[10:25] Love continue but brotherly love has
[10:28] been taken away
[10:29] now let's read some scriptures about
[10:31] brotherly love you know what's
[10:33] interesting is that Paul is the only one
[10:36] in the New Testament that used that
[10:38] phrase brotherly love there's a lot of
[10:41] others that Peter talked about it that
[10:42] different ones talked about it in
[10:44] Scripture that you can read about but
[10:45] that phrase brotherly love only came
[10:49] from Paul and what a strange thing you
[10:51] start doing research and and what a
[10:53] strange things to tack those two
[10:55] concepts together love and brother
[10:58] brother L love to put them together to
[11:01] represent something something that's
[11:04] Supernatural that God can do in your
[11:07] life where where uh I mean we'll get to
[11:10] it in a moment that that's why when we
[11:12] come to the house of God we call one
[11:13] another brother and sister it's more
[11:16] than just a symbol of respect but it
[11:19] represents that we are because the life
[11:22] of God has been imparted to us and we're
[11:24] all part of the children of God that we
[11:26] are spiritually supernaturally brothers
[11:29] and sisters and that you you really
[11:32] understand that right and and you you
[11:34] you you'll begin to project the love
[11:36] that Paul is talking about like in
[11:37] Romans 12 where he said let love be
[11:40] without
[11:42] dissimulation upour that which is evil
[11:44] cleave to that which is good be kindly
[11:47] affectioned one to another you you'll
[11:50] find out when you study scripture that
[11:52] kindness is spoken of an awful lot be
[11:55] kindly affectioned one to another with
[11:57] brotherly love in honor preferring one
[12:01] another and in first Thessalonians he
[12:03] said but as touching Brotherly Love ye
[12:05] need not that I write unto you for ye
[12:08] yourselves are taught of God to love one
[12:11] another in First Peter Peter says seeing
[12:15] you have purified your souls and obeying
[12:17] the truth through the spirit un
[12:18] unfeigned love of the Brethren see that
[12:21] you love one another with a pure heart
[12:24] fervently and in chapter three Peter
[12:26] said finally be be ye all of One mind
[12:29] having compassion one of another love as
[12:32] Brethren be pitiful be
[12:35] courteous and John of course we know
[12:38] John talked about love a lot we know
[12:41] that we have passed from Death un life
[12:44] because we love the Brethren yes you
[12:47] that's how you know that's what John is
[12:49] saying that's how you know that you're a
[12:51] Christian when somebody can maybe say a
[12:54] little hurtful word but yet you love
[12:55] them anyway when somebody does something
[12:58] that disa appoints you but you love them
[13:00] anyway because you're trying to win them
[13:02] to the
[13:03] Lord and and and beyond that so many
[13:07] other attributes that go into just the
[13:09] reasons why you love one another in John
[13:12] Chapter 13 John said Jesus said a new
[13:16] commandment I give unto you that you
[13:18] love one another as I have loved you
[13:21] that you love that you also love one
[13:24] another now that's a pretty big thing a
[13:27] pretty big statement to love one another
[13:28] as Jesus loved us cuz Jesus gave his
[13:30] life for us he laid down everything for
[13:33] us and as we're going to do later this
[13:35] afternoon he got down on his knees and
[13:37] washed the feet of his disciple of Peter
[13:40] and so he he he abased himself and gave
[13:43] his life gave everything died died so
[13:46] that they could have life all those so
[13:48] we got to live in we got to follow in
[13:49] that example in verse 35 he said by this
[13:52] shall all men know that ye are my
[13:54] disciples if ye have love one to another
[13:59] now see this is what we're growing up to
[14:01] in maturity you start out with a little
[14:03] baby form not really knowing quite how
[14:06] to express love and not being able to
[14:08] react the right way in different
[14:10] circumstances but you grow and you grow
[14:12] and it that that Divine love that is in
[14:14] you from the New Birth pushes out and
[14:16] pushes out until you come into a mature
[14:18] form where you can stand there like
[14:21] Jesus as they were slapping him on the
[14:23] face and really love you can stand there
[14:25] on the on the cross like and even like
[14:27] Steven did when they were oning him and
[14:29] say father forgive them cuz they don't
[14:31] know what they
[14:33] do in Hebrews 13:1 where're we're
[14:35] continuing on he said let Brotherly Love
[14:37] continue now now I I've got this slide
[14:41] in here for a reason let's meditate on
[14:43] this for a moment I I I actually got to
[14:46] listening to a little Baptist on on
[14:47] YouTube doing a little Sunday school
[14:49] lesson and he made this statement that
[14:51] when he be started going through Bible
[14:54] School the first thing they told them
[14:56] this was in a a bible school he that as
[14:59] a Christian you will find that the
[15:01] people that will hurt you the most will
[15:03] be other
[15:04] Christians now this what this goes into
[15:07] brotherly love this is kind of the
[15:08] elephant in the room that when you're a
[15:11] Christian people are going to hurt you
[15:14] and the the Christians a lot of times
[15:15] are going to say and do things more
[15:17] hurtful than than people in the world
[15:19] that people that you work with because
[15:22] really because your expectations are
[15:24] higher you come to church and you expect
[15:26] that people are going to love and be
[15:28] kind and everything
[15:29] I I got out the other day just actually
[15:31] I think it was yesterday or the day
[15:32] before I was on the phone with a pastor
[15:35] and he just began opening up to me about
[15:38] um things that had happened in his life
[15:40] that things hurtful things and and I'm
[15:43] relating this because there's a lot of
[15:46] people that have been hurt by a lot of
[15:48] things and been going through a lot of
[15:49] things and it's part of your Christian
[15:51] Journey that God molds you into a place
[15:54] where you react the right way that
[15:57] because as a Christian that's what we're
[15:59] that's what we're growing up into
[16:00] brotherly kindness as a Christian you
[16:02] must learn to love in spite of the way
[16:06] that people do you and say to you and
[16:09] you know it's just part of life that
[16:11] sometimes things are going to be said
[16:13] that you don't like even you know I I
[16:15] was I was meditating this morning I I
[16:18] have probably I'm almost certain of it
[16:20] said things that that have hurt and
[16:23] grieved people in the past and it hurts
[16:25] me to even think about that but you know
[16:27] I that's not my intention I certainly I
[16:30] certainly never want to want to say or
[16:32] do anything that would hurt somebody and
[16:34] maybe maybe now would be a good time to
[16:35] express my apology to you if I've ever
[16:37] done anything I'm sorry and I you come
[16:39] to me and I'll make it right but but
[16:42] when people here's the Christian
[16:44] principle those things are going to
[16:46] happen and when they do happen we've got
[16:48] to react in the right way because that's
[16:51] and you're it's not a rule book where
[16:53] we're trying to put in feathers but it's
[16:55] a something that God has to do where you
[16:58] eat and you eat and you eat and you push
[17:00] out until it's not something that you're
[17:01] putting on but it's something truly
[17:04] genuine that God has done in your life
[17:07] where you can love somebody even if they
[17:09] hate you now you think about what John
[17:12] Wesley said here in this quote he said
[17:13] though we cannot think a light may we
[17:16] not love a light that we don't think a
[17:19] light you know you go around this
[17:21] building this morning there's probably a
[17:22] lot of different thing different
[17:24] differences of opinion some believe we
[17:26] landed on the moon some believe we
[17:28] didn't some believe this some believe
[17:31] the all the different kind of things
[17:33] that you could go through but yet we can
[17:35] love one another may we not be of one
[17:38] heart though we are not of one opinion
[17:40] without all doubt we may here in here in
[17:43] all the children of God May unite not
[17:46] withstanding these smaller
[17:50] differences dietr boner said those who
[17:53] love their dream of a Christian
[17:54] Community more than they love the
[17:56] Christian Community itself become
[17:59] destroyers of that Christian Community
[18:01] even though their personal intentions
[18:03] may be ever so honest Earnest and
[18:07] sacrificial what's he saying that you
[18:09] come to church and you have this lofty
[18:11] expectation of how everything is going
[18:13] to be and you begin to lose sight of the
[18:15] fact that these are individuals that
[18:17] these are people and you stop loving one
[18:20] another because you've got this losty uh
[18:24] this you think it should be this way you
[18:26] don't like the way the song servic is
[18:27] conducted maybe you don't like the
[18:29] personality of the minister and you
[18:31] begin to lose the love for the one
[18:34] another that's what he's
[18:36] saying in other words when individuals
[18:38] become so attached to their idealized
[18:41] vision of the community they can become
[18:44] critical and discontented or even
[18:47] disruptive when the real Community
[18:48] doesn't live up to that Vision instead
[18:51] of accepting and loving the community as
[18:53] it is with all its imperfections they
[18:55] may try to force it to fit their ideal
[18:58] causing Discord and potentially tearing
[19:00] the community apart and we certainly
[19:03] don't want to force anything forcing is
[19:06] that nickan Spirit where you're trying
[19:08] to drive people to the gospel and that
[19:11] is absolutely opposed to everything that
[19:13] we stand for so anyway the point of this
[19:16] is look past all the imperfections as
[19:18] love one another brother R said in
[19:20] Divine love and Sovereign Grace he said
[19:22] now we are faced in a day that when it's
[19:24] prophesied to us that Brotherly Love
[19:25] would become a strange thing among
[19:28] people and it's to my humble belief that
[19:31] that is the greatest of all the gifts
[19:33] that there is in God's Bible if the Lord
[19:36] Jesus to stand on the platform tonight
[19:38] and look me in the face and say I'm
[19:39] going to give you your choice you can be
[19:41] a great person a great Minister I'll
[19:43] give you a gift of preaching the gospel
[19:45] or I'll give you the gift of teaching
[19:46] the word or I'll give you the gift of
[19:48] Divine Healing I'll give you the gift of
[19:50] Prophecy or I'll make you a prophet or
[19:52] any of the fine Gifts of Faith any of
[19:54] the gifts that's in the Bible I'll give
[19:56] them everyone to you but then I'll
[19:58] withhold love from you or either I'll
[20:00] give you love and withhold the gift from
[20:02] you I'd say Lord take all the gifts amen
[20:05] and let me have the love see for no
[20:08] matter how many gifts we got they will
[20:10] never do us any good except the love of
[20:13] God is the motive behind the gift we
[20:16] must have love now I was thinking you
[20:19] know how see how important love is it
[20:21] trumps every other gift that God could
[20:23] give you and I was thinking yesterday as
[20:26] as they lowered brother Hal down in the
[20:27] ground all the words that were said
[20:29] about him reflecting on the love and
[20:32] kindness that he had displayed to people
[20:34] in his life now you see that's really
[20:36] that's really maybe another elephant in
[20:38] the room that's how people will remember
[20:40] you is the love the love that you had
[20:42] for God yes and the love that you had
[20:44] for your family the love that you showed
[20:47] to people at church and the kindness
[20:49] that you demonstrated the way that you
[20:51] have reflected God so you think about
[20:54] what what really is brotherly love and
[20:56] I've got a picture here of of a brother
[20:58] carrying helping another brother carry a
[21:00] heavy burden when you can yoke yourself
[21:03] up to the other brother now you see
[21:06] sometimes our mind goes to well I don't
[21:08] see brotherly love but let's go back to
[21:10] yesterday you see brotherly love being
[21:12] on displayed when people are saying
[21:14] encouraging words to the family people
[21:17] are getting up early morning to to make
[21:19] them mashed potatoes laboring in the
[21:21] kitchen all these things go together
[21:24] because we're helping when somebody's in
[21:26] need the whole church comes together
[21:28] together and you're helping somebody
[21:29] that's in a need in a time of
[21:31] trouble what is brotherly love love for
[21:35] one another that's why we refer to each
[21:37] others as Brothers and Sisters in
[21:40] Christ which signifies a spiritual
[21:42] kinship among
[21:44] Believers emphasizing that we are all
[21:46] part of the family of God Brotherly Love
[21:48] in This sense means showing love and
[21:50] care and concern for fellow Believers
[21:52] supporting each other in times of need
[21:55] and fostering Unity within the
[21:57] church
[22:00] I'm going to skip that quote just for a
[22:01] minute love for others love towards all
[22:05] people even those outside the faith and
[22:08] love is when you when you love the
[22:10] beggar on the street and try to help
[22:11] somebody maybe at work tell them about
[22:13] the gospel that's an expression of agape
[22:15] love which is selfish selfless
[22:18] sacrificial love that seeks the best for
[22:22] others like doing something nice opening
[22:26] up your door to somebody when there's
[22:28] maybe a v visiting Minister comes to the
[22:30] church and you you're hospit hospitable
[22:32] to them and you'll put them up or
[22:34] different ones in the church doing
[22:35] things respectful dialogue talking to
[22:37] one another with respect doing things
[22:40] doing things for one another service
[22:42] empathy and compassion and promotion of
[22:44] Peace trying to resolve conflicts in
[22:46] your home trying to keep the peace
[22:48] between different Brothers maybe that
[22:50] have differences of opinion defending
[22:52] the oppressed being generous being
[22:56] generous when it comes time for a
[22:57] mission trip and you're willing to help
[22:59] out being generous with cuz why God
[23:02] loves a cheerful Giver praying for one
[23:04] another getting on your knees and the
[23:06] long hours of the night and praying
[23:08] because it's it's love you're doing it
[23:09] out of love and living with
[23:11] Integrity what is brotherly love it's a
[23:14] reflection of divine love which is why
[23:16] John said beloved let us love one
[23:18] another for love is from God and whoever
[23:21] loves has been born of God and knows God
[23:26] Amen if you can
[23:29] love is if if it's really matured and
[23:33] grown up to you till it's bubbling out
[23:34] like a Wellspring of everlasting water
[23:36] where everybody can see it then it's
[23:38] evident that you know God what is
[23:41] brotherly love we let's we're going to
[23:43] dive into it we just got a few more
[23:45] minutes it's looking out for the
[23:47] well-being and happiness of others as if
[23:50] they were family as if they were family
[23:53] now see our our our our our model for
[23:56] the family though is what God says about
[23:58] it in his word because you look at a lot
[24:00] of families and some families are very
[24:03] bitter and they have a lot of Discord
[24:04] and things that's not the model I want
[24:06] to look at some families families have
[24:08] different kind of Dynamics and different
[24:10] kind of issues and things and so we want
[24:12] to make sure that we're looking at the
[24:14] right model of what a family is in
[24:16] Philippians 2: 3- 4 he said let nothing
[24:20] be done through Strife or vain Glory but
[24:23] in loneliness of Mind Let each esteem
[24:26] other better than themselves look not
[24:28] every man on his own things but every
[24:31] man also on the things of others that
[24:33] means when somebody's going through
[24:35] something you you want to help them out
[24:36] you want to uh you you want to be there
[24:39] for them to encourage them and give them
[24:41] give them comforting words and 1
[24:44] Thessalonians 5:11 he said wherefore
[24:46] Comfort yourselves together and edify
[24:48] one another even as also ye
[24:53] do another thing brotherly love means if
[24:56] you really examine it out is mutual
[24:59] respect and regard for each other's
[25:01] feelings opinions and boundaries
[25:05] treating one another with kindness and
[25:07] consideration now I got a little kid now
[25:10] see this is where we really get into the
[25:11] needy greedy of
[25:13] it you think well I don't have
[25:15] boundaries and I shouldn't have
[25:16] boundaries but everybody's got
[25:17] boundaries when a little a young lady
[25:20] goes on a date or goes out uh sitting
[25:22] down in the living room with a young man
[25:24] or whatever she's got boundaries with
[25:25] the way that that man can talk to her
[25:28] and and refer to her and everybody's got
[25:30] boundary you'll say maybe the maybe the
[25:32] simplest boundary would be like this
[25:34] this little kid sitting there in the
[25:35] back seat of the car and the other kid
[25:37] goes sitting on his side of the seat
[25:39] where you got a boundary and so really
[25:41] when you when you start loving one
[25:42] another and respecting one another
[25:44] you're going to recognize that other
[25:45] people have boundaries and you're going
[25:47] to stop when they say you can't cross my
[25:49] boundary you're going to respect that
[25:51] we've got boundaries maybe another
[25:53] example of a boundary is when when you
[25:55] go through the buffet line and you got
[25:56] your plate of food and you got your
[25:57] mashed potato sitting there and your
[25:59] boundary is this is my food now I I I'm
[26:02] willing to give it to you if you need
[26:03] food but it's my food and you can't just
[26:05] stick your fork in my food in my plate
[26:07] and grab my food because I've got a
[26:10] boundary it's a boundary and if you
[26:12] respect me you'll respect my boundary
[26:15] now now sometime now th this honestly
[26:18] this gets deeper because I I've really
[26:21] been studying out how Satan will try to
[26:24] what what do in in the in the Old
[26:26] Testament the boundary was the promised
[26:28] land and what the devil would do the
[26:29] amorites and the moabites would they
[26:31] would cross that boundary they' get own
[26:33] the property of the Israelites and
[26:36] that's the same thing that the devil
[26:37] will do in your life and you got to
[26:39] realize brother random said that Satan
[26:41] is a bully and that's what a bully does
[26:43] like this picture he'll poke poke your
[26:45] fing his finger at you try to get on
[26:47] your property and you have to stand firm
[26:49] and say this is my property and you
[26:52] can't come on my property you real you
[26:54] realize you begin to you begin to treat
[26:56] treat the devil like a bully and say
[26:58] this is mine God has given it to me and
[27:01] recognize that God has given you
[27:03] boundaries that you can enforce against
[27:05] the
[27:06] devil so we got a we we we've got
[27:09] boundaries that's that's just the the
[27:11] the the reality of the thing we've got
[27:12] boundaries and when you really respect
[27:14] and you're really kind to one another
[27:16] you will respect one another's
[27:17] boundaries respecting boundaries is is
[27:19] is part of
[27:21] self-respect setting boundaries is a
[27:23] sign of self-respect it means you value
[27:25] yourself enough to Advocate your own
[27:27] well-being and I I I maybe you you say
[27:29] well this seems different than Luke 16
[27:31] where it says that Jesus Jesus told us
[27:33] that if somebody asked for your cloak
[27:35] give them your tunic also but maybe we
[27:37] don't have time in the couple of minutes
[27:39] remaining but there's I I I I just want
[27:41] to make the point there's nothing wrong
[27:44] was standing up for your boundary and
[27:47] saying this is mine and every you know
[27:49] you got a home you got a fridge when
[27:51] somebody comes over if you don't want
[27:52] somebody poking around in your
[27:53] refrigerator you can say I would brother
[27:55] I would rather you didn't open up my
[27:57] free fridge if you want something I'll
[27:58] get it for you now now of course you
[28:01] know when you come to my home if you've
[28:02] ever been there you're welcome to open
[28:03] up the fridge or the pantry or whatever
[28:05] I I'm not going to set that boundary but
[28:07] some people might and if they do it's
[28:10] common courtesy to respect that boundary
[28:13] because they don't want you looking in
[28:14] their fridge and and so that's what
[28:17] kindness is kindness is respecting the
[28:19] boundary that somebody else has if they
[28:21] don't want to be talked to in a certain
[28:23] way and they say brother I you know I I
[28:25] don't want to be called that name I I
[28:28] that bothers me when you it hurts my
[28:30] feelings when you call me that then
[28:32] they've set a boundary and if you're
[28:34] kind and respectful and loving then you
[28:36] will respect that
[28:39] boundary now is't that example of this
[28:41] little This Little Child in the back uh
[28:43] one's poking at the other just like how
[28:44] we used to do when we were riding down
[28:46] in the car with Mama and Daddy one of
[28:48] them's trying to get over on the other
[28:49] seat and when we were kids we didn't
[28:52] respect boundaries but when we're adults
[28:55] We Know Better Don't
[28:58] boundaries are for protection like like
[29:01] the example of the of the young lady
[29:02] that's got you know you're she's talking
[29:04] to a young man there's going to be
[29:06] boundaries of respect a father is going
[29:08] to set boundaries and you better not
[29:10] cross those boundaries when you're
[29:11] talking to a father's daughter
[29:13] boundaries protect us from being
[29:16] manipulated used or violated right
[29:19] boundaries are for your emotional health
[29:21] they prevent us from being overwhelmed
[29:23] by the needs or demands of others
[29:25] allowing us to prioritize our own
[29:26] well-being and emotional health like
[29:28] like some people at work you know
[29:29] they'll turn their phone off at night so
[29:31] they cuz they got a bound I got to get
[29:32] some sleep so they set that boundary
[29:34] don't call me after a certain time and
[29:36] you're setting those boundaries so that
[29:38] you can have sane a sane
[29:41] mind you know you had good emotional
[29:43] health and clear communication
[29:45] boundaries help us communicate our needs
[29:47] and desires more clearly and assertively
[29:50] reducing under misund understandings
[29:52] I've got one more minute and I'll just
[29:54] close on that thought I think most
[29:56] problems in relationship ships most
[29:58] problems in a church most problems
[30:00] anywhere come from miscommunication so
[30:03] if you can learn to articulate things
[30:05] well and communicate clearly if you if
[30:07] you don't like it when your when your
[30:09] spouse doesn't help out around the house
[30:10] or whatever communicate it and things
[30:12] will that that helps a whole lot if you
[30:15] don't like the way that somebody's
[30:17] talking to you communicate and it will
[30:19] help communicate and set those
[30:21] boundaries because if nobody knows that
[30:23] you're offended nobody knows that you're
[30:25] hurt then you end up having unreasonable
[30:27] expectations and it just causes all
[30:28] sorts of problems that we're talking
[30:30] about what are we talking about loving
[30:32] one another respecting respecting and
[30:35] being kind to one another amen we'll
[30:38] stop right there God bless
[30:44] you
