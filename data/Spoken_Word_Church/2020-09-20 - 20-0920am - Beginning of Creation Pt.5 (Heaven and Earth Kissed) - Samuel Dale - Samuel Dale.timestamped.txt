[1:45] on
[1:46] revelations 3 14
[1:49] and then we'll go to matthew 1
[1:52] be kind of an odd part but it'll connect
[1:55] the next two messages together so uh you
[1:58] know being odd
[1:59] using the scriptures what i'm saying
[2:01] that i'm i'll be using but
[2:03] you know just remember to pray one for
[2:05] another sister
[2:06] audrey is doing better she's uh you know
[2:09] coming out of it and everything she's
[2:11] been and we appreciate god taking care
[2:14] of that
[2:14] and and all because she's she's doing
[2:17] good
[2:17] and all my wife's picking up and getting
[2:20] better
[2:20] she's still having a lot of trouble with
[2:22] her her sinuses and their things or
[2:24] whatever you know
[2:26] congestions but just just keep praying
[2:28] for the lord would
[2:29] would uh bring her all the way through
[2:32] all of this and
[2:33] all this together remember all the
[2:34] others brother ron spencers and
[2:36] the different ones and brother carol
[2:39] different ones that are
[2:40] sick among us and things that just pray
[2:42] the lord would bless amen
[2:44] the lord willing this coming wednesday
[2:46] brother chris long
[2:48] will be here ministering for us on this
[2:50] wednesday so remember that
[2:52] brother chris long and most of you know
[2:54] him amen and uh
[2:57] i see anything else we miss him
[3:00] all right okay all right heavenly father
[3:03] we thank you for this day and your grace
[3:05] thank you for everything
[3:07] thank you for loving us lord because we
[3:10] know that if you didn't love us
[3:12] it wouldn't matter on the other end
[3:14] because
[3:15] there wouldn't be any for it to be
[3:18] for us but yet you loved us and cared
[3:21] for us and
[3:22] and guided us all of these years brought
[3:24] us to understanding of your word and
[3:26] your
[3:27] your being in person and things and we
[3:30] just thank you for that we ask you now
[3:32] to just open our eyes as we stop
[3:35] we talk a little bit about your word and
[3:37] we pray that you would just bless each
[3:39] one
[3:40] guide us forgive our sins and cleanse us
[3:42] from all unrighteousness
[3:44] and keep us in jesus name amen
[3:49] revelations 3 14 this is to this age
[3:54] right the message to this age
[3:58] and unto the angel of the church of the
[3:59] lady of siam's right
[4:01] these things saith the amen the faithful
[4:03] and true witness
[4:05] the beginning of the creation of
[4:08] god amen so let's go over now to
[4:12] matthew 1
[4:15] and we'll pick up a thought from this
[4:18] maybe
[4:19] it will tie together as we uh can
[4:22] continue
[4:23] our thought uh start verse 19 matthew 1
[4:27] verse 19.
[4:29] then joseph her husband being a just man
[4:31] and not willing to
[4:33] make her a public example was minded to
[4:36] put her away privately
[4:38] but while he thought on these things
[4:40] behold the angel of the lord appeared
[4:42] unto him in a dream saying joseph
[4:45] thou son of david fear not to take unto
[4:48] thee
[4:49] marry thy wife for that which is
[4:51] conceived in her
[4:52] is of the holy ghost and she shall bring
[4:56] forth a son and thy shall call his name
[4:58] jesus
[4:59] or he shall save his people from their
[5:01] sins
[5:02] now all this was done that it might be
[5:05] fulfilled which was
[5:07] spoken of the lord by the prophet saying
[5:10] behold a virgin shall be with child and
[5:13] shall bring forth a son
[5:15] and shall then they shall call his name
[5:17] emmanuel
[5:18] which being interpreted is god with us
[5:22] in joseph being raised from sleep
[5:26] did as the angel of the lord had had
[5:28] bidden him
[5:29] and took unto him his wife and you were
[5:32] not until she had
[5:34] until she brought had brought excuse me
[5:38] and knew her not till she had brought
[5:41] forth
[5:42] her firstborn and he called his name
[5:46] jesus he may be seated to the lord at
[5:48] his blessing
[5:49] to the reading of the word now remember
[5:52] what our thoughts is
[5:53] is connected and you'll see to why that
[5:56] we're using this
[5:58] because see his name is jesus what is
[6:00] the name of god jesus
[6:03] all right so that's simple we should
[6:05] keep that thought in our mind it should
[6:07] you know be no trouble to us to be able
[6:09] to understand and follow that
[6:11] line as to what we've been doing all
[6:14] right
[6:15] and see we've been trying to cover uh
[6:19] all the way back from the beginning and
[6:21] coming through
[6:22] and up now we are into the basis of
[6:25] the fact of jesus christ himself coming
[6:28] to be
[6:30] in human flesh and that's why we're
[6:32] using this
[6:33] and you'll call his name jesus you know
[6:34] and all because that would be
[6:36] tying together all right but see what
[6:39] did we see now
[6:40] uh if you'd like if you want some
[6:43] questions
[6:43] and answers on this uh turn in a
[6:46] question or whatever and we'll try to
[6:48] uh answer your questions uh maybe next
[6:52] sunday or whatever if you want to
[6:53] turn them in just just let us know and
[6:55] we'll we'll try to
[6:57] to cover them all right because i know
[7:01] in saying some things it's hard to try
[7:03] to
[7:03] hold a point and you know you read where
[7:06] brother branham says it
[7:07] uh god's first creation was himself well
[7:10] see then if your mind gets off on that
[7:12] and you get to thinking in the wrong
[7:14] direction
[7:15] uh it turns out to be the wrong thought
[7:17] but yet we ought to
[7:19] remember because that's what i've been
[7:20] trying to emphasize
[7:22] over and over is what does it happen
[7:25] god condescending stepping over into
[7:29] another form revealing himself
[7:32] by the opening of the word and and doing
[7:36] that then it
[7:36] it comes forth that there's just one
[7:40] true and living god
[7:41] and he's manifesting himself in many
[7:43] ways coming down
[7:45] to reveal himself to mankind
[7:49] all right and then revealing himself to
[7:51] us then we can see
[7:52] that it wasn't god trying to create
[7:55] jesus and jesus creating another one
[7:59] or something like that it was god
[8:01] unveiling himself or
[8:03] making himself known and making it
[8:06] another form that was our point that we
[8:10] tried to
[8:12] to emphasize that god making another
[8:17] change it into another form all right
[8:19] and
[8:20] see now when you look at it i hope you
[8:23] followed one thought
[8:25] that we covered uh
[8:29] in the basis of looking back there
[8:34] excuse me all right looking back there
[8:37] before the foundation of the world we
[8:39] can see that it can unfold
[8:41] and unveil itself down to where that
[8:43] we're living now
[8:45] all right then it'll keep unveiling as
[8:46] we keep going
[8:48] because it is the revealing of god to
[8:50] mankind
[8:51] okay all right now
[8:56] so we we're i want to get up to one
[8:59] point on this one number
[9:00] go ahead and pull up number four
[9:03] forgive me my coffin has
[9:08] developed again and you just pray for it
[9:11] it'll run out okay
[9:16] now brother branham calls it
[9:20] a new creation
[9:23] all right a new creation
[9:28] he tells us what's happening then
[9:31] god is fixing to make another creation
[9:36] all right now watch him he
[9:39] creating mortal earth
[9:43] mortal life angels singing in heaven
[9:46] but here he's creating a new life
[9:49] eternal life for man and he sing into
[9:52] his subjects true angels
[9:56] on the earth not in heaven heaven had
[9:59] eternal life see in you know and they
[10:02] sang to the heavens when the mortal
[10:05] creation come in and here this
[10:09] immortal creation is coming in
[10:12] and now they are singing see so you've
[10:15] got two things to be covered
[10:17] an immortal creation or a mortal
[10:20] creation
[10:21] all right remember how we've tried to
[10:22] bring that out make sure you hold your
[10:24] point
[10:27] that mortal is you know like dealing
[10:30] with natural things
[10:31] okay all right and god created first
[10:34] his spiritual being or brought into
[10:38] being his spiritual being
[10:40] through the opening of the word and
[10:42] stepped into those
[10:44] things and just moved on down to where
[10:45] we're at all right
[10:47] then he starts then and we got to that
[10:50] when we talk about the lord jesus christ
[10:52] coming
[10:52] that he got to that point of saying well
[10:55] okay
[10:56] now we've come to a physical thing
[11:00] all right see then when jesus christ
[11:02] stepped on earth
[11:03] he was a mortal being
[11:07] you know human being that body was a
[11:10] human being
[11:11] all right created for the purpose
[11:14] of death and in the different things
[11:16] created for that purpose of
[11:18] of manifesting itself all right and see
[11:21] then you can see that the spiritual
[11:23] creation of mankind back in
[11:25] in the garden and all and coming down
[11:27] and then it comes to a physical
[11:29] all right and after the lord jesus
[11:31] christ said he stood here on earth
[11:33] god made manifest in another form
[11:37] all right you can call him a son of god
[11:41] you can call him god you can call him
[11:43] all of the things
[11:44] because he's manifesting himself in many
[11:47] different ways
[11:49] in in to doing so it's it's just like
[11:53] the acts of a play that you just keep
[11:56] unfolding and going through the acts of
[11:59] a play
[11:59] and as it does then you can see that
[12:02] then the lord jesus
[12:03] is being made known and see what he's
[12:07] doing he's doing exactly what we said
[12:09] there the other week when it says
[12:11] that he's the only begotten all right
[12:15] and see then he made god known and god's
[12:18] making him known
[12:19] all right there on the river jordan then
[12:22] you see him standing there
[12:25] as he's making god known to the world
[12:28] you know in his life he's doing john
[12:31] introduces him
[12:32] the lamb of god that takes away the sin
[12:34] of the world and the prophet said the
[12:36] greatest of all
[12:37] scriptures to think about was that
[12:41] scripture
[12:43] or that they're on the river jordan
[12:47] a great thing took place
[12:51] all right i don't want to back up into
[12:53] the message too much but
[12:55] we covered the new new creation he
[12:58] started a new creation
[13:00] a creation of himself
[13:04] all right not a not a
[13:07] uh a separate one
[13:10] okay go ahead to number uh
[13:16] let's see if i can get this one yeah
[13:20] go ahead to number number four a
[13:23] is actually what it is but it's the same
[13:25] thing he had started
[13:27] a new creation what was it
[13:31] a creation of himself
[13:37] god was made flesh and dwelt among us
[13:40] that's the bible said in the beginning
[13:42] of the creation of god
[13:44] god was created in human form in
[13:48] jesus christ his son god dwelled
[13:53] me he built this tabernacle
[13:57] of flesh and bones a new creation
[14:01] all right now that was what we were
[14:02] trying to bring down see you got
[14:04] he go you go backwards and you got
[14:07] the beginning of the creation of god
[14:10] okay
[14:11] all right this all ties together into
[14:13] one thing for this age to get the
[14:14] message of this
[14:15] age that this beginning of the creation
[14:18] of god is when god would come into
[14:19] manifestation
[14:20] and when did the prophet say god came
[14:22] into manifestation
[14:25] in the wound of a woman a new creation
[14:29] was made
[14:32] right a new creature
[14:35] all right see life begin with with
[14:39] you know the things of manifestation
[14:42] and showing and seeing god to revealing
[14:45] himself
[14:46] unveiling himself and see now he's
[14:49] coming to show
[14:50] that what his purpose is doing he's got
[14:53] to become
[14:53] human flesh to where that he can be
[14:57] the one that can pay the price all right
[15:00] and he's creating a new creation
[15:04] a new race not a different race now
[15:08] that music is is the same way as the
[15:11] beginning
[15:12] you take the word new and it sounds like
[15:13] something new
[15:15] well that's new now it doesn't mean it
[15:18] that way no more than beginning means
[15:20] the starting of something
[15:22] it's a manifestation or unveiling or
[15:25] stepping into another form
[15:28] manifesting himself to word that he can
[15:30] reveal himself to his people
[15:33] in another form and that form as we've
[15:35] come to now
[15:36] is the body of the lord jesus christ
[15:40] and that's why it says and you'll call
[15:42] his name jesus
[15:43] because he's emmanuel god with us
[15:48] all right and that was what was taking
[15:51] place
[15:51] but it took a little while for it to
[15:53] manifest itself into the manner that
[15:56] was needed so then look what i'm what
[15:59] we're trying to get to
[16:00] see he started a new creation
[16:04] god and man becomes one
[16:08] all right a human being
[16:11] steps up on earth
[16:15] to be our kinsmen redeemer
[16:18] to pay the price to do all the things
[16:21] and bring forth
[16:22] into manifestation that god and man can
[16:24] become one
[16:27] all right and see then that way you can
[16:29] you can put it into
[16:31] uh god dis unveiling himself
[16:35] manifesting himself okay let's pick it
[16:38] up let's get number five
[16:43] and look what he says about it
[16:51] now to show that he was the first also
[16:53] he was he's the
[16:54] beginning of the creation of god oh
[16:58] to you catch it how could god be created
[17:02] if he's a spirit how could he be he's
[17:05] eternal he never was created he never
[17:09] will be created
[17:10] because he was god at the beginning
[17:13] now remember how he was writing it the
[17:16] beginning
[17:17] what are you doing he's stepping into
[17:18] another form okay
[17:20] but he he that is the beginning of the
[17:23] creation of god was jesus christ when he
[17:25] was made
[17:26] manifest when god lived in him
[17:30] now that's a new race he is god's
[17:33] creation oh my
[17:35] see the first and the lies the amen the
[17:37] beginning of the creation of god
[17:39] when god created himself a body he come
[17:42] down
[17:43] and lived in it that's the beginning of
[17:45] the creation of god
[17:46] the isn't he wonderful all right the
[17:49] beginning of the creation of god
[17:52] what is it it's when god steps into
[17:54] another form
[17:56] and creates or becomes another uh
[18:00] not another being not another person but
[18:02] becomes the same person made manifest
[18:05] in another form all right now that's
[18:07] what we've been dealing
[18:08] all the way through and trying to get it
[18:10] now we've come to the beginning of the
[18:12] creation of god
[18:16] the beginning of the creation of god is
[18:18] the lord jesus christ
[18:20] when god created in the wound of mary
[18:24] the egg and the sperm to bring forth
[18:28] and to bring that body into being right
[18:32] that he would be at the beginning of the
[18:33] creation in other words another creation
[18:37] you understand me he's going to a new
[18:40] creation
[18:42] now we'll get to it to where we're
[18:43] getting our part of that new creation by
[18:45] the new birth all right
[18:46] but i want to hold it to the point this
[18:48] morning to where we can look at it the
[18:49] beginning of the creation of god
[18:51] is god made manifest in another form
[18:55] are unveiling himself into a bodily form
[19:01] that he can make itself known that he
[19:03] can be comprehended
[19:05] all right and we see that when the lord
[19:07] jesus christ were standing here
[19:09] see then he was here on earth in in
[19:12] doing and
[19:13] and following him through his life
[19:18] in the manifestation through his life
[19:20] all right see
[19:22] god was never created
[19:26] right that's what we just read he was
[19:28] never created
[19:30] we look at it and say well there he was
[19:32] he's a creator he's a new creator no he
[19:34] just steps into another form
[19:37] he steps into another form he's he never
[19:39] was created
[19:42] you see what you have you've been
[19:44] talking about created created
[19:46] no he wasn't created he just stepped
[19:48] into another form
[19:50] that's been my whole point for the past
[19:53] two or three services to get you to see
[19:55] coming down to the point now where that
[19:57] jesus is standing on earth
[19:59] the beginning of the creation of god
[20:02] or that god stepped down into the wound
[20:05] of a
[20:06] a woman and brought forth the body
[20:10] that would be the beginning of the
[20:11] creation all right
[20:13] that that would start a situation i
[20:16] don't know what you call it situation
[20:18] it would start a position or doing
[20:21] that god when man would become one
[20:26] all right now god and man becoming one
[20:30] is the most marvelous thing that can do
[20:32] i want you to just get to something
[20:35] uh let's bypass
[20:38] something here today because i want you
[20:39] to get it go ahead over to number uh
[20:46] number 12. let's get to scripture
[20:48] because i want you to see
[20:49] because we're going to say brother brown
[20:51] said this was the greatest scripture
[20:54] all right now watch it this is taken
[20:58] from the psalms
[21:00] and i will hear what god the lord will
[21:03] speak
[21:04] for he will speak peace unto his people
[21:06] and his saints
[21:09] but let them not turn again to folly
[21:13] surely his salvation is nigh them that
[21:15] are that fear him that
[21:17] glory may dwell in our land mercy and
[21:20] truth are met together
[21:22] righteousness and peace have kissed each
[21:24] other
[21:25] truth shall spring out of the earth
[21:28] and the righteousness shall look down
[21:31] from the heaven
[21:33] heaven and earth is going to kiss
[21:36] each other that's what happened when the
[21:39] lord jesus christ
[21:40] came into manifestation in a human form
[21:45] all right so let's just read what your
[21:47] prophet had to say about it
[21:49] go ahead with number 13 now
[21:52] forgive me for jumping away over this
[21:54] but i want to get this point because
[21:56] we've been on the other
[21:57] trying to cover it and you should
[21:58] understand
[22:01] he's talking about says many people
[22:04] bypass this scripture
[22:06] but to me it's one of the outstanding
[22:09] scriptures
[22:10] of the bible that when heaven
[22:14] and earth embraced when god
[22:17] came down in the form of a dove
[22:20] and went into his son in the form of a
[22:23] lamb
[22:23] all right now where did that happen
[22:25] river jordan
[22:27] right river jordan is where the lamb and
[22:30] the dove met
[22:31] all right there he was the lamb was on
[22:34] the earth the dove came down
[22:36] and he said that was the most marvelous
[22:38] scripture that could ever be
[22:39] why because heaven and earth kissed each
[22:41] other
[22:42] what about that heaven and earth kissing
[22:46] each other in this manifestation go
[22:48] ahead number 14.
[22:50] i want to read these few where you can
[22:52] see it
[22:56] that was the greatest event this world
[22:58] has ever seen
[22:59] and we'll see
[23:03] now read that
[23:08] that was the greatest event this world
[23:10] has ever seen
[23:12] and we'll see
[23:17] until christ and the church has united
[23:20] together again
[23:23] now did you listen the greatest event
[23:27] was when god and man
[23:29] met heaven and earth kissed each other
[23:32] that's the greatest event until
[23:34] something else takes place
[23:36] what's going to take place look at it
[23:38] the world has ever seen
[23:39] and we'll see until christ and the
[23:42] church has united together again
[23:44] that is when god and man became one
[23:47] heaven and earth embraced
[23:48] each other and kissed each other and
[23:50] settled our sin
[23:51] question forever is when the dove and
[23:54] the lamb
[23:55] united together one of the greatest
[23:57] that's when the price
[23:59] when the greatest reconciliation
[24:02] that was ever made is when god and
[24:05] christ
[24:06] united in one as one
[24:10] heaven and earth kissed each other see
[24:13] we look at the scripture back there and
[24:14] we say well that's an old testament
[24:16] scripture
[24:17] of heaven and earth get sure but it was
[24:19] a sign
[24:20] or a speaking of the fact that the lord
[24:22] jesus christ would have to come into the
[24:24] earth
[24:25] and die to pay the price for this to
[24:27] take place all right
[24:28] heaven and earth would embrace each
[24:31] other
[24:32] he said the most marvelous scriptures
[24:36] think about it the fact that it would be
[24:40] so marvelous of things to take place
[24:42] that
[24:43] god would say that heaven and earth
[24:45] would kiss each other
[24:49] what when god and man become one
[24:54] now you just think about it you think
[24:56] about all that we we've tried to preach
[24:58] about jesus christ and all of the years
[25:00] and all that but just think about it
[25:04] that when god and man becomes one
[25:10] that was when jesus christ walked on the
[25:13] shores of galilee
[25:17] most marvelous scriptures the most
[25:20] outstanding things
[25:21] right there took place that when god and
[25:24] man become one
[25:26] the prophet said that is the greatest of
[25:29] all outside of the fact of the church
[25:31] see
[25:32] why because the church has got to become
[25:34] one with god
[25:35] that's why i just bypass that i want to
[25:37] get over to this that heaven and earth
[25:39] would kiss each other
[25:42] that's happening again in the end time
[25:47] god and man is becoming one again in the
[25:50] bride of jesus christ
[25:53] all right see because that's the promise
[25:57] the promise of that being of that to
[25:59] take place
[26:00] and heaven and earth would kiss
[26:04] unite together you realize then the
[26:07] bible says
[26:08] in god that god was in christ
[26:10] reconciling the world unto himself
[26:12] all right see in that body was a human
[26:16] element
[26:19] a new creature now
[26:22] follow me for a minute a new creation
[26:27] not another creation not something else
[26:29] different
[26:30] but see back there before the world
[26:32] there he stood
[26:34] as that form if you want to look at it
[26:36] that we've spent so much time trying to
[26:38] divide it to see it you know and looking
[26:40] at it
[26:41] as to know that it's a form of a man
[26:45] god is in in the form of a man he
[26:48] he's not a glob he's not a spirit just
[26:50] floating around or
[26:52] whatever he's
[26:55] god and man become one in jesus christ
[27:00] you think about it an opportunity for
[27:04] sin to be covered
[27:07] through this one that would give the
[27:08] price all right
[27:11] and see then it would be that heaven and
[27:14] earth would kiss
[27:16] unite unite together heaven and earth
[27:20] would unite see it would take the one
[27:23] there had to be one to come
[27:25] to be our kinsman redeemer
[27:28] all right to pay the price for all of
[27:31] the doing
[27:31] and it does and it it would make a new
[27:34] creation
[27:38] distinct from the old creation
[27:41] you know all right a new creation
[27:45] would be made to worthy you could look
[27:48] at him and see
[27:49] there's almighty god
[27:54] living on earth in the human flesh
[27:58] called the lord jesus christ
[28:02] all right and that would be even until
[28:04] the bible would call it heaven and earth
[28:06] kissing
[28:08] it would cover it to the basis that they
[28:11] would be
[28:12] god and man would become one
[28:15] in a new creation
[28:19] not a not another creation now it's not
[28:22] changing something else
[28:24] it was god stepping over into another
[28:26] form
[28:27] in a new creation a new new
[28:30] beginning as we'd call it but not
[28:33] something to worry that you
[28:34] you say well that's that's where you
[28:36] begin no that's word
[28:37] that you and i had our opportunity
[28:41] see the lord jesus christ paid the price
[28:46] and as he paid that price then heaven
[28:48] and earth kissed each other
[28:50] right there on that river as it was
[28:52] doing that was the most marvelous time
[28:54] that could ever be
[28:56] to see that god would come down and
[28:58] dwell in
[28:59] in mankind and make a new creature
[29:06] you realize then what happened see the
[29:08] lord jesus christ
[29:09] is the beginning of the creation of god
[29:12] how did he begin
[29:14] in the wound of a virgin mary
[29:18] right made a new creature
[29:22] a new creation
[29:25] may god and man become one
[29:29] and look at it from the basis of what
[29:31] what that is
[29:32] and then let's jump over
[29:39] they don't have this one but i'll i'll
[29:41] just read it off and
[29:43] and we can we can take part of it and
[29:46] understand
[29:46] listen the beginning of the creation of
[29:50] god
[29:51] that is who the lord jesus says he is
[29:55] those words don't mean exactly as they
[29:57] sound to us
[29:59] just taking them the way they sound has
[30:01] made
[30:03] some people in fact multitudes of people
[30:06] get the idea that jesus was the first
[30:08] creation of god
[30:09] making him lower than godhead see he
[30:11] wasn't the first creation of god
[30:13] he was god in another form
[30:16] are you following me he was god in
[30:18] another form not god in another person
[30:20] not god in another
[30:22] do it but yet he was he's stepping into
[30:25] flesh
[30:27] to where that he can can we can
[30:29] understand then the first creation
[30:31] create all the rest and
[30:32] and whatsoever it contains but that is
[30:34] not right they got it up now
[30:37] you know that doesn't line up with the
[30:39] rest of the bible
[30:40] the words are the beginning or author
[30:42] and he goes through the fact of how
[30:44] showing that jesus is very god john 1
[30:47] and then he goes back to to genesis 1
[30:50] and he goes over to exodus and all the
[30:52] things
[30:54] and look what he says surely we can see
[30:56] what these words mean
[30:58] to have any other interpretation would
[31:00] mean that god created god how could god
[31:03] create
[31:04] be created when he himself is the
[31:06] creator
[31:07] but now he is standing in the midst of
[31:10] the church
[31:11] amen now where's he at
[31:19] are you following me
[31:22] heaven and earth kissed each other when
[31:24] jesus christ came into human flesh
[31:28] where's he at now
[31:34] he's still in that human flesh he still
[31:36] has that flesh but yet now what's he
[31:38] tying together so listen what he's
[31:39] saying
[31:42] but now he is standing in the midst of
[31:44] the church as he stands out revealing
[31:48] who he is in this life's age he calls
[31:50] himself the author of the creation of
[31:53] god
[31:54] this is another creation this has to do
[31:57] with the church
[32:01] look this has to do with the church
[32:08] not a different creation this has to do
[32:11] with the church
[32:12] this is a special designation of himself
[32:16] he is the creator of that church the
[32:19] heavenly bridegroom created his own
[32:20] bride
[32:22] right so now watch what he's saying
[32:27] this is another creation this has to do
[32:29] with the church
[32:31] this is a special designation of himself
[32:34] he is the creator of that church the
[32:37] heavenly bridegroom created his own
[32:39] bride
[32:41] as the spirit of god he came down and
[32:43] created in the virgin
[32:44] mary the cells from which his body was
[32:47] born
[32:48] i want to repeat that he created the
[32:50] very cells in the wound of mary for that
[32:52] body
[32:52] it was not enough of enough for the holy
[32:56] spirit to simply
[32:57] give life to a human over him supplied
[33:00] by mary
[33:01] but that would have been that would have
[33:03] been sinful man producing a body
[33:06] see it won't work that's why you've got
[33:08] to have your virgin birth you can't you
[33:10] can't have it
[33:11] all right that would not have produced
[33:13] the last adam
[33:15] all right he was of the new creature
[33:19] god and man met and joined he was the
[33:24] first
[33:25] of this race he's the head of this race
[33:30] now listen trying to bring it over
[33:34] to a feist run through from where we
[33:36] were
[33:37] that looking back there what was he
[33:40] almighty god
[33:44] manifested as
[33:48] we call him the jehovah the old
[33:50] testament
[33:52] but then it comes forth and here is the
[33:54] jesus of the new testament
[33:56] and who is he he's the beginning of the
[33:59] creation of god
[34:01] he created in the wound of a mayor of
[34:04] mary the
[34:05] body that would come forth to be that
[34:07] body that
[34:08] a body thou has prepared me all right
[34:11] now he's coming back as bride form
[34:16] me now he's coming to his true point
[34:20] if it was true that what we were saying
[34:22] while ago that
[34:23] the greatest scriptures of all is where
[34:25] god and man
[34:26] met and heaven and earth kissed each
[34:28] other and he said that was the greatest
[34:31] thing
[34:31] that could have ever happened when that
[34:34] took place
[34:36] what about when it takes place in the
[34:37] bride of christ
[34:41] when are we going to realize our
[34:42] position
[34:46] a new creature a new creation
[34:52] not a different creation not something
[34:55] different
[34:56] it's exactly what he done
[34:59] he came down and gave his life that you
[35:02] and i could have eternal life
[35:05] and to do that makes us a new creature
[35:07] as paul calls him
[35:09] in christ
[35:12] all right that new birth that you
[35:16] receive that new birth is what we're
[35:19] talking about
[35:21] is that new birth comes down into a
[35:23] human element
[35:26] and dwells in a human element because
[35:29] that's what happened back there with the
[35:30] first creation
[35:33] god come down brought that human element
[35:36] into being all right that human element
[35:40] was a body
[35:42] it was not eternal
[35:45] jesus's body was not eternal it had to
[35:48] be made eternal in the resurrection and
[35:51] the change and the thing in the
[35:52] ascension
[35:52] then it was made eternal all right see
[35:56] then it made a way to where the eternal
[35:58] life could be imparted for you and i
[36:01] a new creature a new creation
[36:07] brotherhood said he's no longer dealing
[36:08] by ways of the old
[36:10] doing you know he said he dealt with
[36:12] abraham and he lied he dealt with
[36:14] moses and he done this he's done that no
[36:16] this is this is not it
[36:19] this is a new creation
[36:22] in christ jesus
[36:26] the new birth then is the most important
[36:29] thing
[36:30] that you could ever think of in life
[36:33] because that's what makes you a new
[36:34] creature
[36:37] it makes you a new creature not another
[36:40] creature
[36:40] not a different one it makes it what
[36:43] it's supposed to be
[36:45] it makes us coming to finality the way
[36:48] the lord jesus came to it
[36:52] his body had to be made eternal
[36:55] well because it was it had a beginning
[36:58] all right but he was a new new creation
[37:01] why because there back in the old
[37:03] testament
[37:05] you couldn't see god and understand
[37:09] you couldn't follow her you know you he
[37:13] he would talk about the things but even
[37:16] when he come on earth
[37:18] and dwelt on earth to try to manifest
[37:20] himself for us to see him
[37:22] he still was so hidden to mankind until
[37:25] we couldn't comprehend it
[37:29] it takes the new birth and you and me to
[37:31] understand
[37:33] a new creature he was a new creature
[37:38] god and man became one that's a new
[37:41] creature
[37:42] that's what the new birth is to me and
[37:44] you that's right
[37:45] are you following me the new birth to me
[37:48] and you
[37:49] is god and man becoming one
[37:53] and that's seeing who we are and what's
[37:55] taking place and
[37:56] us dying out to ourself and accepting
[37:58] jesus christ as our savior
[38:01] making us part of that new race
[38:05] a new race of people was brought you
[38:07] talk about see as i said
[38:08] we we tried to figure out what did he
[38:10] look like what was he how did he look
[38:13] was he big
[38:14] little or whatever you know no just
[38:16] forget all of that
[38:20] and look at mankind and see what mankind
[38:22] is and you'll see what god was before
[38:23] the world
[38:24] because he made man in his own image
[38:26] right
[38:28] all right and see then when he made him
[38:30] in his own image
[38:31] then you come down to where we are now
[38:34] that is christ in you the hope of glory
[38:38] a new creature you're a new creature in
[38:41] christ jesus
[38:42] you're not the old and made over see
[38:49] you're not just even starting out of
[38:51] justification and sanctification and go
[38:54] so far and turn back
[38:56] no
[38:59] it's the new creature right go all the
[39:02] way until we become a new person
[39:04] in jesus christ that god and man can
[39:07] become one again
[39:09] like it was back there you think
[39:13] what a wonderful day would be there for
[39:15] to be able to see him walking on the
[39:17] shores of galilee
[39:21] but what about now with me and you
[39:24] that he's living in you and me
[39:28] it's christ in you the hope of glory
[39:31] is god made manifest in another form
[39:35] called the bride that makes her a new
[39:38] creature
[39:40] in christ jesus we're not just the old
[39:44] creature made over
[39:45] polished up or done you got to totally
[39:48] die to yourself
[39:50] and be born again and then when you're
[39:53] born again see then you become a new
[39:55] creature
[39:58] a new creature in christ jesus see
[40:01] not another one but a new creature you
[40:03] become like he was
[40:05] you say yeah but we can't never be like
[40:07] him see after a point we take it
[40:09] the wrong way we say well we can't be
[40:11] like him well you know he was special
[40:14] he was a 20 he was a 16 element body
[40:20] sure he was god made manifest sure
[40:24] but he was also a man and he walked the
[40:28] shores of galilee
[40:31] and he gave his life to where we could
[40:33] have life
[40:35] a new creature
[40:38] see when jesus christ came into being
[40:40] back there in the old testament
[40:42] as the word see did he become a new
[40:46] creature
[40:47] the word
[40:50] i was thinking about that this week and
[40:52] thinking that that's hard probably for
[40:54] the mind to comprehend
[40:56] that you you go back to the beginning
[40:58] and you talk about the word
[41:01] well you're not talking about letters on
[41:03] a page
[41:04] you're not talking about some kind of
[41:06] doing direction
[41:07] now you're talking about how god made
[41:10] himself
[41:11] manifest in a human element
[41:17] to where that he could pay the price
[41:21] then what we got to do is relax and
[41:23] accept that point
[41:24] except what he said a new creature yes
[41:28] a new creation as paul said
[41:31] old things is passed away and all things
[41:34] are made new
[41:36] all right and if it's true like i said
[41:39] if it's true that heaven and earth
[41:41] kissed each other
[41:42] and that's a wonderful thing when the
[41:44] lamb and the dove met there on the
[41:46] river jordan sure that was a wonderful
[41:49] time that was a great opportunity
[41:51] when god and man become one
[41:55] you know in full manifestation
[41:58] all right but what about when god and
[42:00] man becomes one in
[42:02] you
[42:06] yeah but i i just can't say i just can't
[42:09] think that he could come and be that
[42:11] connected to me why not that's where the
[42:14] trouble's at
[42:17] if he's a new creature why can't we be a
[42:19] new creature
[42:21] if he's a new creation why can't we be a
[42:23] new creator
[42:27] right because that's what it is you see
[42:31] it's it's made to work that god could
[42:34] give his own life
[42:40] and then come back and live in the man
[42:47] heaven and earth kissed each other
[42:50] god and man become one
[42:55] and they did
[42:59] he's the only he's the only begotten
[43:02] of the father right
[43:07] you know we spend a lot of time i think
[43:08] about it the other day you ought to run
[43:10] this in sometime
[43:11] we think a lot of times about abraham
[43:13] you know and we say that well
[43:14] well thy son died only son
[43:18] when we're talking about abraham we said
[43:19] see there then uh
[43:21] um you know
[43:24] isaac would have been the only son
[43:27] ishmael would have been to
[43:29] not to promise me
[43:32] all right and we say well that wasn't
[43:34] his son it was his son
[43:36] but it's making a point and the bible
[43:39] says that he
[43:40] is to be only begotten
[43:43] you realize that isaac was the only
[43:45] begotten of abraham
[43:49] what your bible says brought into
[43:53] manifestation
[43:55] as to be what he's supposed to be where
[43:57] it could be the promised seed
[43:59] all right see a new creature
[44:03] came into being back there 2000 years
[44:06] ago you see yeah but it had to be
[44:09] yeah it was before then sure we know
[44:11] that we know that he
[44:12] was a human being we know that he came
[44:15] forth and manifested himself
[44:16] in in many ways in many forms and and
[44:20] and all like that but yet it really all
[44:22] happened 2000 years ago
[44:24] when god and man become one
[44:30] but can we say that we're one with god
[44:32] like that
[44:36] if we die to ourselves and accept him as
[44:40] our savior
[44:44] heaven and earth can kiss each other
[44:48] and has done it through the the
[44:51] very fact of a new birth
[44:55] a new birth
[44:59] a new birth a simple point of a new
[45:02] birth
[45:04] brings us to a position that god and man
[45:07] can become one
[45:11] god and man we can become one in
[45:14] manifestation
[45:15] and be a new creature a new creation
[45:22] see that's what we are we're a new
[45:23] creature
[45:25] we're a new creation
[45:29] god's not dealing by ways of the old no
[45:31] more he's dealing by ways
[45:33] of the new creation it's christ in you
[45:35] the hope of glory
[45:42] god and man has become one
[45:45] through the opening of the word
[45:48] that's my whole point now to get it for
[45:50] for a few minutes for you to think about
[45:52] it
[45:53] you say well it's hard for me to
[45:54] understand how that back before there
[45:56] that
[45:57] you'd say that there was was a
[45:59] self-existing one and all
[46:01] and then he comes down and he comes to
[46:03] logos and logos to theophany and
[46:06] theophany to word
[46:08] all right well just remember you've got
[46:10] to think a whole lot about a lot of them
[46:12] things because in that form that he was
[46:14] in back there
[46:15] he was in form of a man
[46:21] he was in form of a man
[46:25] see then when you come down to where
[46:27] that god and man then
[46:28] can become one and you accept him as
[46:32] your savior
[46:35] then now you're back to that new
[46:36] creation
[46:40] you're back to the point that it's
[46:42] supposed to have been the whole time
[46:44] a new creature a new creation
[46:50] if we're we're a different creation now
[46:53] listen to what i'm saying about it i
[46:54] don't misunderstand
[46:56] me into the wrong point we're all human
[46:59] mortals
[47:00] everybody in the world has 16 elements
[47:02] of mud and potash and different things
[47:06] all of that all right but just remember
[47:10] that by the new birth you are not of
[47:14] that old race
[47:20] you're not of that old race
[47:25] you see yeah but we still are sure we're
[47:27] human beings because we're here
[47:32] but god has made a way that where he
[47:35] could come and live in
[47:36] us in the new birth
[47:40] and manifest himself and make a new
[47:43] creature
[47:45] a total new creation
[47:52] we're we're a new creation we're not the
[47:54] old creation just polished up
[47:57] we're a new creation
[48:01] we're we're in that manifestation of god
[48:04] and man becoming one
[48:07] why shouldn't we be honored and glory
[48:10] into the point of
[48:11] what we are and what god has made us
[48:14] he's made us these things
[48:18] you know you say are you trying to make
[48:21] us a different race
[48:22] of people no we're all a human race
[48:28] we're all in one human race right
[48:31] was listening last night where brother
[48:32] branham was talking about and he said
[48:35] he's talking about racism and things you
[48:37] know and he said that
[48:38] talking about it doesn't matter whether
[48:40] it's black white yellow green brown or
[48:41] whatever it is said we're all the same
[48:45] well that's true see we're all the same
[48:48] there's no big eyes a little used in
[48:50] this thing or nothing
[48:54] but the only way that you'll ever be
[48:56] anything
[48:58] is for that new creature to come inside
[49:03] that'll solve the racial problems that
[49:06] solve all
[49:07] worlds situations it's for them to get
[49:10] to new birth
[49:12] and become a new creature
[49:16] not a different one just take this
[49:18] creature that we are
[49:21] and justify it sanctify it
[49:24] fill it with the holy ghost
[49:29] and we are a new creature in christ
[49:32] jesus
[49:35] see if heaven and earth could meet
[49:37] together and kiss
[49:39] and it be a glorious opportunity what
[49:40] about when it meets in you and i am
[49:44] to bring this manifestation into to do
[49:46] it
[49:47] see one of these days somebody's going
[49:49] to walk off of this earth
[49:52] yes all right i want to do that don't
[49:54] you
[49:55] i want to i want to get out of here all
[49:58] right
[49:58] but see i know and realize that the
[50:00] world is not in that
[50:05] but see you're a special people
[50:10] created for a purpose right
[50:13] created for a purpose he was a special
[50:17] person
[50:19] that body was created for a purpose
[50:23] all right and see then that's what he's
[50:25] doing on me and you the statue of
[50:27] perfect man
[50:28] he's building a new creation
[50:31] not a different one now not another one
[50:32] he's not not don't don't take me wrong
[50:35] it's the point that he's giving us an
[50:37] opportunity to become what he is
[50:45] a new creature a new creation
[50:50] god and man met back there in a new
[50:53] creation
[50:54] what do you think is going to happen
[50:55] here when the bride realizes what's
[50:58] going on
[51:01] yeah but see that's that's where our
[51:03] problem is we say but but brother dale
[51:05] you you can't make us so much we're just
[51:08] a human being like the rest all right
[51:11] i'll agree with you we're a human being
[51:14] we're of the human race
[51:16] all right but for some reason
[51:20] god chose you
[51:25] right he chose you for some reason
[51:29] what was the reason well now
[51:32] now we know it and we we know we know
[51:35] the truth about it
[51:37] it's not he just picks and chooses
[51:38] something no
[51:42] but what if he is watching the way we
[51:44] live and what we do
[51:45] and the things that we walk and do what
[51:48] if he is watching that
[51:55] we could be a new creation in christ
[51:58] jesus
[52:00] walking up on this earth in a
[52:02] manifestation
[52:07] a different people
[52:11] something to be different he said but
[52:14] we're not supposed to be different we
[52:15] just i
[52:16] ain't talking about that we are
[52:18] different
[52:22] some reason some something happened in
[52:25] your life somewhere
[52:27] that brought you to a position to find
[52:28] this message
[52:32] right why
[52:37] it wasn't something we was doing
[52:40] [Music]
[52:42] but he was looking at that new race of
[52:44] people
[52:46] a new creation
[52:49] he's proud of this new creation
[52:53] he's making it manifest what you think
[52:56] about it
[52:58] what about it another creation
[53:03] no longer dealing by ways of the natural
[53:06] things
[53:07] but dealing by the ways of the spiritual
[53:10] right
[53:13] a new creation
[53:17] he said it's not the old creation made
[53:20] over
[53:22] or it wouldn't be called a new creation
[53:25] see it's another creation
[53:29] distinct from the old one no longer is
[53:33] he dealing by ways of the flesh
[53:36] that was how he dealt with israel and
[53:39] abraham and all that
[53:41] he was god's
[53:47] god brought a creature into being years
[53:50] ago
[53:51] i don't like to use that word like that
[53:52] but what else you going to call it
[53:55] see whereas man was trying to figure out
[53:58] what god looked like
[54:00] and god was trying his best to show man
[54:02] what he was
[54:05] allowing him to see and understand
[54:11] that all he's got to do is just accept
[54:12] jesus christ as his savior
[54:17] and then let him start working on that
[54:20] a new creature
[54:24] a new creation
[54:27] all right you don't have to act
[54:30] different
[54:31] we are different you don't have to make
[54:34] yourself something we are something
[54:39] yeah but you're trying to make us some
[54:41] kind of a natural thing
[54:42] well what are you trying to make us
[54:47] there is a lot of this that is natural
[54:52] a creature it is a new creature
[54:58] a new creation
[55:01] god and man becomes one
[55:05] the war they can actually manifest
[55:09] themselves
[55:10] all right the beginning of the creation
[55:14] of god
[55:16] god created himself a body and come down
[55:20] to and lived in it that's the beginning
[55:24] of the creation of god
[55:26] god created a body
[55:30] come down and lived in that and made
[55:33] that
[55:33] to be him god himself in the human flesh
[55:38] a new creature
[55:44] now if you pinched him he felt it
[55:52] but yet he was a human
[55:55] come to give us to pay the price
[56:00] you don't get nothing out of anything on
[56:02] just get that little bit right there
[56:04] because that's the point
[56:08] i've spent so much time on trying to
[56:10] express
[56:12] what he was before the foundational
[56:13] world until now i'm hoping we'll try to
[56:15] get to the places of looking at what he
[56:17] is now
[56:20] a new creature
[56:23] a new race of people
[56:29] what about a new race of people coming
[56:31] on earth
[56:34] but yet it's not like we're looking at
[56:36] it then
[56:38] it's not a new race like that it's a
[56:41] race of people that are born again
[56:43] christians
[56:47] that should be our thoughts
[56:51] that should be the the point that we
[56:53] should always do
[56:56] see
[56:58] god's only begotten son
[57:03] all right
[57:06] but that wasn't a a different person
[57:11] that's god made manifest just in another
[57:13] form
[57:15] god in you is not another person it's
[57:18] god made manifest
[57:20] in another form
[57:24] when are we going to realize that and
[57:26] come to that position of doing it all
[57:28] right
[57:29] think on these things i know it just
[57:32] walked off short but
[57:33] i've tried to express a lot of about the
[57:37] past and the things until now it's time
[57:39] for us to settle down into what we are
[57:42] right now christ
[57:46] in you the hope of glory
[57:49] god coming down to live in mankind yes
[57:53] the way that he's always wanted it
[57:58] the way he's always tried to get it to
[58:00] be come on come on musicians
[58:03] think on these things
[58:08] a new creature
[58:11] a new creation
[58:15] god in man becomes one
[58:23] [Music]
[58:25] what about it are we part of that race
[58:28] or were we just talking about it
[58:31] well well brother there we've always
[58:33] preached about new new races and you
[58:35] think
[58:36] but still it's not making it manifest
[58:43] i want to see it made manifest in your
[58:44] life in my life
[58:47] i want to see god made manifest in the
[58:49] humor of people come on let's stand
[58:51] together
