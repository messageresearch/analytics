TRANSCRIPT
========================================
there were all fed sealed now remember the fish seals and something that's happening when I'm from the rapture takes place all right but now he's not remember to and I in it it was wonderful what broke in took six eel all about Genesis one in beginning God created heaven to the earth and then he come to know where there was a disruption of total destruction of nature in Noah's day that was total destruction of nature in a hen's day by saying there was a total disruption to nation he went right down through always an element disruption of nature when Jesus Jesus got it come on man it'll be more like that no one ever been born like that man so there was a disruption of the natural flow of what went on during the dying this human life one two three all right so which was one two and three and brother critic long you know the brother that was here this Gunder was not service he's been studying on the dimension student so me and him put some of our notes together and I got a lot further and he got off further so we were sitting in we will beat the table resource in the mother who wanted what we were delivered to that was get comments cause you're home so uh it was great fruit so now if it's eel [Music] we must see you know I always talk about I can feel that you you know the onions the onion but there's a little small layer if you keep having to pull back and it's really easy to kind of thing is when you cut it with the knife sighs sharp shot back it's oh I didn't wanna mention them sorry they're my turtle head before you forget Mary Hart yes I told him not to be on that you know the third full America hope is gonna have to come in a hurry or some that is rotor because I had a human anything and he said there was a man and he's looking today and he's acting like it's some kind of a bomb like it's a bomb he's going have made one stroke yet Joanna Bob Bob he has not made one yet he's going in like I could get attacked so that was mentioned a touch something makes and I wanted invite him so my my name is cut so I grabbed an outgoing I cut top up on a hand back to him and he's over Maginot nine and then Tony law was what there's the Bob you could that onion if you turn her over he was cutting with the sharp edge up everybody thank you crops I make yes but there was an onion peel in there little bit that was gold why anything there isn't here make sense there was an onion peel and a sharp short of the word come on thank God it is two-sided angle or disaster has got two ages on it so they're done my wish that ball drybeck anywhere everybody a memory the other had a chance I needed he needed so how you go up like that you find out your does Nathan knows their way around the kitchen [Music] also internet people no one pocket well then if I know oh that one but anyway the sharp sword of the word though you cut that and you to start people behind what is it it's the same onion but it's a different well alright so we're looking at a different level here than just a fifty love jus that's what I'm gonna talk about today other than fifth seal do like like the sea seal is into the disruption of nature through two prophets they will speak what we're gone but it affects us now in our own cell and in any effective no way it affected a permit are able to Abraham in fact that although three times it has it back alright because remember the seal three Turtles seal just didn't open and develop because Christ is still sealed so everything that's wound up in the seals of welcome Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever all right the seals when Janice is just like a cold row couple Sundays ago held it the spirit of Cain and Abel you can see that white horse rider and a red horse rider and the pale horse rider coming right down through those people is obtained enabled right and how they came when out from the presence of God and there was your total death or your annihilation because remember what we gonna rap sure if judgment for everyone else except 144,000 so we leave when we go into the presence of God that was a problem he went out of the presence of God when we go into the presence of God we go up but now what happens down here the presence of God has lifted off the Gentile a distance Asia it's always going to be with 144,000 all right so there is a you know there's a time here where the there's 144,000 I'm also gonna be saying okay all right Gentiles you can't put a block Walid away because it's just making me people but this fifth seal up now let's take the fifth seal and we can tie it all the way back to the book of Genesis because that fifth seal is a word that we haven't brought in yet the let's read at minimal noon we'll bring it in because watch what happened we had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held right now for testimony of Jesus Christ now assault under the altar crying how long how long is this there these people but now I don't know if I got it in the cult this afternoon but brother round talks about the theophanies that he saw in the sixth dimension when what they were sold under the altar crying how long not to avenge our blood these people were trying to avenge our blood so the ones that are in the city dimension are now under the testimony not that they bill I don't want to go into my Raja I won't go in and so I've done so I've taken and accept what he has done in that state dimension is the testimony of Jesus Christ that they held on the face of the earth so that six dimension is much different than the fifth domain the other dimension because the state dimension is where you have your souls under the altar that were here accepted Jesus Christ as their personal Savior God born again and then God put them into that dimension okay this step sealed Jew is not in that dimension per se the man extended per se because remember what roads are given to them okay and we may cover that it's afternoon a little bit more choking something coming down the mountain yesterday it was really it really helped me understand a little bit more continuity what's going on with our soul with our be open e with our the one the questions are there I got two questions if afternoon and try to cover them all on that Genesis 1:26 minutes so we don't do a little Sunday School class upstairs so I got my board on I got the board the big ol repairing the big board up so we know it over people see it was a brother preaching over there Michael Halloweeny familiar Tim him Jurchen he's about my age please black brother real to proceed what pre-sewn just can't because I looked at his note so I'm sitting right on folded up and there's no a piece of notes up I mean Betty hits law school like 38 your brother damn Jim said something to me and these pizzas yeah I gotta have this I'm see well yes no I mean he had I bet you they wasn't the one call per page I don't think they will have an order get a body that I don't have to do this I put my glasses on he I mean he was he said already broken be left red big river policy Rose England till he didn't see very well so anyway he had his notes and he's like mine my notes are pretty pretty good-sized Joe job to do my number four bought horse you know I'd like to do about face painting toes hey buddy that you can make oh you did coming son no yeah sure yeah when he had opened the fifth seal I saw it as part of a soul level or slain for the word of God now look the word of God why our world think we're going to break this down a little bit today while were they slain for the word of God remember this group is used while we're they explained for the word of God because all the Old Testament said they were going to be even the Bible in the New Testament it and then then in the old template says they were killed all the day long in other words the Jews are going to be dispersed you're going to be a despised nation you're going to be found Wars what what is that is what the Word of God was telling you the gym since you turned me down this is what's not happening to you because remember when she went whoring in the Old Testament and God put her away in divorcement he said you're in trouble Jacob's trouble you have trouble all your days even now you're going to bring Jacob's trouble all the way over to here because what is the what is the the tribulation for the Jew is called Jacob come because of what Jacob did all the things that you did they were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held now that's brain that all the whether you say well what about the 50 of you with just the property guys tonight with in Hitler's you know the 6.5 million Jews will they were slain with the Word of God they turned the Word of God down and the Word of God said right here I'm going to protect a group of people because they turned me down but not only they turn me down I handle I had to put my hand basically in other words no further amount of Revelation okay cuz remember when Jesus was here some bleep it was the Messiah even in there in John I believe it in 1400 where they believe doing positively don't even live vaccine versus later they turned him they turned away running same people yeah we believe you know all that Matt we're out of paper come they work out of their body to know that you know so they were slain for the word of God that before they were written before the foundation in the world okay and now what we're doing is see and now that is being fulfilled on one group of people not this 144,000 there's another group there's another group of people which is the physio team hi maybe we say they're all Jewish La Trobe forgiven they're in another dimension and is no combat be all right so we have moved from the combat Beach which is in this dimension combat beast work here all right then when we then the holy those lifts off the earth with us when we leave the Holy Ghost leave where Gentile people gonna say honestly so they leave out of this dimension we go into another dimension right now so the fifth seal Jinzo once they're killed in this dimension they go into another dimension so this is another dimension we're talking about that John one two three and four is right here this dimension this is where these happen okay - uh I'm talking about uh we get the supernatural part of it happen to us one two three four see we have no part of this if you're well you can cancel out out no you have to look at the onion peel you got to feel like another layer and see what God is telling us because they were playing for the word of God what the Word of God is what protected them the Word of God is what gives them why rose they didn't deserve it well you mean you didn't either so you can say we deserve it made in now on one level we're just like the pit sealed you the only thing is is that God set the word to the Gentiles and we accepted what he did we accepted salvation we accepted Redemption yes that's my god Donald cross these did not but we all started in the same way we all started under one word but without that we're all did allow grace by grace are you saved through faith okay now they're gonna be saved by grace with no faith in Jesus Christ because God said I have blinded my people that you know what you say it in it's my fault how can I condemn them when I was doing it and one of the brothers would speak preaching on love and it was really good because love being corrected the only way not to love me in us put us on bring more legs as you only link on to look think about it if we come down here is just zombies and just you know we're just here and we're going to be and I don't have a choice I've got to go this way know what love is that there's no love the love partying is put you down here and give you a choice give you a choice and then you choose what greater what greater joy that you choose and you know what the people that they go help they choose you go ahead God chose to save them but they're gonna choose to go help someone so I was going to say some say that's your choice resurrection we have free moral energy right up to the change I mean it continued drop from Adam all the way up to now you say well no that was not no still got three more legs go all the way up to the change of the body because you decide what you tricked anybody sure you weren't interested that's right that's right they received them so with that so they were slain for the word of God so the Word of God stood they were going to be slain the Word of God said this will be a Gentile bride that's going to what be called by his name these are not these are not called by the name of Jesus Christ reason 3 the fifth seal resurrection this is the testimony which they held not the testimony of Jesus cuz you know what their testimony was we are God's people period we are Jews because remember the Word of God that slayed them is also the Word of God is going to save them they only hear the word of God that slays us or is going to save us all right so so we think so much then when I got this box right here we go we got to get out of the box there's no one person there's only group of people devolve does another 41 now you and I are just that's when I leave us that's why we must think eternal that's why the eternal thoughts of God work for us we'll cover this afternoon with identity 1.6 minute sure the Word of God gives twice as well I'm working on another sermon to where there's a will there's lay my free will but God's will does it all they say but my will has got a match his will he wrote a will all his subjects he wrote in a will and this is it will - where there's a little there's a way I couldn't if my parents never left me anything and wrote a well they wrote a well did leave me anything how getting them right the will tells me that I get some the wheel tells me that I get so they were slain for the word of God and the testimony which they held so this is a group of people that's all Jewish saying under this seal now like I said there's an appeal there's me in you because we all live under grace what is great unmerited favor unmerited favor you to all the were different from them how I think you get grace by the marriages hair grace is unmerited favor like I said you say don't think about grace there's no way a human being has ever ever come up with grace there's no way because we always fetch it we always say this one and this one no admission yes indifferent unmerited favor is God put it out there you who would accept it and who wouldn't and he has this waiting ohmy God he's the same thing with a Liz and he had it wait until now to the need I think I'll read this afternoon where brother Brown said that blood sacrifice was back in Bernard Mifflin doctor but she got go further than that in mind doggy sweet Jesus Christ for members of the world all right thing I go back further than that but then you come into the garden there's and I'd make it an animal sacrifice to cover why I believe that someone me you try think of grace think of the grace of marriage and divorce think of the grace that beef look you and I pass judgment on a people that did not go by the Word of God killed zord of God in flesh kill oh and here we are we're judge we're standing here will judge all they have is attack money how would you how would you I'm God's people God's troll men but look at you you killed god you're still doing the things you're doing you know you like we would say you're cutting hair you wearing paying you know you kidding now where is that here we're do's and don'ts right here well show me right in here where where dude and oh it's a testimony that they held so how far are we from them we're not we're not we're just like them the other thing is we have grace through faith that Christ died for us and we accepted what he did no they they did is they just accepted it what Jehovah which they all know that Jesus Christ Jehovah said the Jesus of where the people in other word bear say where the people talk when we tell them whether we because remember over there now and even I think about this other thing that decision that has me cuz brother around painted to that we know it was it was Jews from back from Jesus's time gross 5th elder brother battle brings it in that distilled you there people went to that concentration camp that was probably murderers and liars and thieves and whoremongers and no Stella Leny so God will give me someone tells you you you just that and you just that next day you leave it to die God said this God said to the Prophet that the fifth seal Jew would make it white robes are going to be given to them because God Himself blinded the island of his own children and he is going to extend them more grace than you'll ever know remember the old story when you get to heaven you as a group of people laughing it's Latin over there - what these people have initially these didn't unknown we got to work I didn't think these people gonna make it this one around they made it to worry laughing right there laughing Co didn't thank you so then you'll add great they told us he said there's no big people there that you didn't think there would be like and there's not gonna be people there that you saw was laughing all right so what is that great so this bit feel to me is nothing but the highest apex of running of divine grace there's ever been bestowed even on a group of people but also menu because we're not that far from them listen people we term God now then you're not when you do the things in the world your terms on family you were born turns the word then you were born it's and Jaclyn's Nicholas you had what you have a word of God and you had a testimony you coming up all right but now watch this is where brother Rams that this couldn't be born again believer see how the word just guide your up where you need to go and they cried with a loud voice and how long O Lord holy interested and you depend on the Lord they just don't know Jesus right they know the Lord they know Jehovah they know Jehovah God they know there was a creator they know all that listened they read the okay I'm a better weekend Oh Lord holy and true faith and make you fall status did man Jesus was who he was does thou not judge and avenge our blood now look does spell not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth what about me in you God why is that person can't you do something about that person is persecuted Lincoln hello I don't have any happened to me in you know I judge these people but remember when the hose really dropped in sideways what burger I'm sure you say God forgive that perhaps may God forgive the person that's because the inside man these people don't have the inside man yet not yet in this part of the script okay but watch when they say this look at media what happened God down the last drew say well black dog owners no better than around oh and I don't know he's good in water over now where's the handicar lies do what about grace how long O Lord holy and true because thou not judge and avenge our blood there was nowhere in here the probably God said where they said Father forgive them for they know not what they do see so that's an attitude of someone without oligo okay that's an attitude good and avenge our blood but what their meds in the end of this is the greatest point of grade because they were available good what he never answered except down here right here what was that rejected blood white room for giving under your blood in other words I'm going to give you something you're not even asking for they're asking for life avenge our blood you know blood for blood I for now they're still back in the Old Testament hybridizes Burton jameth angry Jehovah and white robes were given unto every one of them looks like he calmed down a little bit because they're not saying anything yet and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow-servants right and their brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled now remember the only point is 144,000 is going to receive the holy oak but some of these others are just going to be killed why because the review program said they were killed because they were you Hitler killed them because they were of a Jewish race no other not because they ensure their who underline think that people will tell you that the Jews had the money and different needed money and they turned him down but hey if it was hard you it's now right but what happened is that those hundreds of zone bulletins I mean hundred thousand a month to learn about invalid demons were released in Iowa and Hitler and I made a choice what to kill the Jew with this bull building he was fulfilling the Word of God and then it was fulfilling the Word of God and they died under one testimony word you we are God's chosen people just like Graham I raised my soul set up there it goes desk is your look I can't help I'll born here I am God's people because he told me see then you get supple that's what there does their God set on his children they don't see though that that guy came over and became Jesus miles to die for their sins but you know what he died morning anyway he died for their sins up he died for this group so there's no way they can be give a white road unless Christ I'll uncle I'm dr. payoff Hillary he's people to be fitted okay that's why it's really hard I'm telling you it's really really hard so might does something against you and then they get born again you still got a memory of what that person done to you when I will tase up and it's hard to say that God has forgiven them and lock their slate clean never to be remembered again it may not the Holy Ghost they're not ever do it again number one number two is they were going to be brought up but you're going to have it people in your life that you've seen that you've done bad things to they'll see you standing up in judgment they going to wonder what the world have them but you got to remember Christ is just the only thing he's going to say here he said they accept is what I did for me and you did it's always eyes right so this does it we did them self okay and they try with a loud voice and a little more holy and true dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth right and white robes were given unto every one of them it was center than them but they should rest yet purple seasons numbers they're in the ground resting right until their fellow-servants also and their brethren would just watch you that's his rafael servicable that should be killed as they were should be full bill actually come up here now to official G with now watch these one I wrote were given now what they're going to do is that grace of God is going to bring them Packard career all Jews let me just put it this way all Jews that were persecuted I don't know that they're just all going to be loved you're feeling they collect don't use it don't care about things you what I'm saying now is those people they're over the integral reality to walk around third you introduce your filthy ism as a filthy center-right hangman a dilator thank you okay but this group of people that was persecuted they're going to be back here all right somehow like I get back here alright cuz it while Rome to give it to cause no they're do away with me feel free to wrap my hair okay into the Millennium what we believe and then 144,000 Jews and us go to the end of millennium because remember you gotta do something with them because their God give them what road got to hold that that's that's the whole ego so that whole ethos has to come back into this dimension into millennium Colette's always going to be here right it's all gonna be here you know you take about the needs of that I don't get on that I just think I yet so maybe I'll get later back now all that I have a hospitality but the Millennium is just going to be what all that is is 126 which is the children of God 144,000 and then you got Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph and all those take part in the Old Testament where they come up I don't know yet I just think I'll it clear and it's not really clear message that I want presume our venture without authority so let's just leave it to be that somewhere that if they're given White Rose they got show up somewhere they don't go to judgment because remember if they go to judgment listen it mean you go to judgment we're in trouble right now they may be a great guy gives you great for your image or you're blinded by a vault Shepard that's what the problems in they use that Lewis version that's cool it's version that's not the bride that's most version come to fully there's only there's only commits these scripture people are going to not go through the great white throne the Gentile bride 144,000 in the fifty of you because the Bible says white robes were given to them already they don't have been in the judgment 144,000 going to receive the new birth here so late oh those are good I mean white throne judgment I don't mean judgment in the flesh I mean the white room and everybody stands before Michael and Jasmine this group of people right here will not be standing before judgment they will be standing engine oh my god that because then then grace is still going to abound but I've said many times before you know you yeah you may think she's very insignificant don't talk legend maybe don't have a lot of revelation but all they got to do is you go down the road and somebody stops and changes your time or somebody gives you a cup of water so I put you in line first come on y-you don't have to be preachers history and shining your light somebody hold the door for you to walk in you show that's insignificant well a couple of waters pretty insignificant really you can think about it just handsome by a water how many times some center grander to my superiors you look thirsty er bottled water so I snuck over get that and any kernel out these gonna throw blow through you into that person and gods going to give them so much greater good - you got what the guy did down here guess what I mean we can't develop that there's no way if we're standing in judgment we got our arms folded we're like dude you had three wives you run around 14 times you have 23 kids you kill the gun go down but then your daddy standing in the back she's going to let Matt Ordway mental oh no no in 2016 that man helped me inside the road and you said you wouldn't forget it then and now and you bring him back to the word and you tell us then this is what your were said and he says enter into the door Lord while great cf-18 we can as human beings we cannot develop the word grace and the way God developed her training which is unmerited favor God's going to give that man in her life because of one thing he did what worth it and he has to honoring work and he did it through someone that thinks they're so insignificant but yeah that meant will receive eternal life and be an eternity for eternity because of what you do so look at all the things you think of all you say well that that's happened to me before well it's happened to you what about all the people down to this this world is going to be full people there's seven billion people here now is we're not really crowded take four-fifths of the herbs and take some of the water out of it you have in 15 many people baby when you ain't gotta worry about social programs bathrooms and all that stuff you know you gotta bring it all together right bring it all in there you know well and gotta make sure this does all that they'll see but look at what how we're going to live what I'm saying if you're going my last too many people know I want more people in have them then what's going to be there oh Jesus I want more people that I owe dog have to create another world he said we create want to go live on why can't we go sit on them on Mars for a little while I'll come back gravel-walk fall below it this very so because if you look at that I believe then when brother Brown preach there's there was a lot of people preachers included back in 1963 that did not believe this you look so this hard for me to believe the gift of my eternal life today morning but it's a word of God right yes go back to the words on is the final resting place and everything is the words of the words I've said a couple wiring my name whereas I've said back to pin told the men that were slain for the word of God for the testimony which they held we are going to be with you now let's take it to the onion field - me and you we take the Word of God we're being slain by the Word of God every day we're being slain by one performance on this same two meters dying it used to be alive yeah man what's doing it the Word of God bottom line is the word thought it does everything okay that's why we must have master we must study ourselves too but we must have mastered to what to line up what we thinks going off on this side you know my brother branham you know there was a lot of people the commentaries of a lot of people that that deal with not a Jew that hated Jesus they had to turn around the Hannity they said let his blood be on us and our children that's why do you know that's why they're being persecuted now even backing them on World War two but we see now that we can send ourselves in the left by the grace of God the Word of God is their testimony what cares why do we hold up sex money Jesus Christ that he died for me not that I did this and I read 24 books and I read and I and I look the only I know if you am okay the I am saying that I am going to be saved by grace through faith which means I gotta go free something I got to go what through a journey of justification sanctification baptismal double so anyway let's stop right there and we'll start again next Sunday a couple and fitzy got few more things in Jessica [Music] you
