when you get ready to go then you can go you can pray as long as you want to um but we'll start at seven o'clock on june 25th it's not mandatory but i believe in prayer and pla and praying in this building helps this building helps the atmosphere amen so on june 25th that would be on a saturday evening at seven o'clock also remember july 21st that's a thursday night remember we're leaving at ten o'clock so we'll be here at nine o'clock if you're going to ohio with us and pack lightly i know some of y'all don't know what that is but you could probably google it and it'll tell you what to do put stuff inside of stuff and i've stuffed so much stuff in my boots the other day until i had all the stuff i needed inside my boot almost so you can do it sisters i know you're shaking your head but you can do it all right so let's get to the word of god everybody happy amen let's go to part 42 of who is this son of man we uh we've been looking at something i want to try to get to it and uh i want to uh thank god that he's give us all this brother bob brother luis brother aaron brother dale just laid an absolute foundation for us to be able to speak on and then we use like brother bob was using his quotes and if you'll notice a lot of times i'll use them i just don't say but it'll be from a previous sermon that brother dale preached so i don't mind using his quote don't mind one bit amen that's what our foundation is that's what we're built on sure we the prophet's message yeah we were built on the prophet's message but it took a five-fold ministry and that five-fold ministry has a voice that five-fold ministry has something to say it can't be different but if it's the same and it's breaking it down to the people then it's the same voice and it all came from god anyway it's not william brown's voice let me read you this quote real quick and i'll prove it to you brother brown said in the token 1963 says we're not to come together to talk about the message we are come together to get in the message and the message is christ he is the word that's right we're to get into it get beneath it yes sir that's what we're supposed to do he was not responsible for any person out from under the blood not one no matter who he was this is from the token message he was not responsible all had to take all had to take not only himself but his whole family he's talking about the night they were getting ready to leave the passover they're only safe when the token was displayed we cannot feel safe until this token is displayed that's right you must come under this token god's holy spirit and it displays to you jesus christ because it comes and lives in you so we're not here to what talk about the message we're here to get in the message and the message is what christ never saw a man that could brag on god so much but interlaced in there he's not ever bragging on himself but he tells you stories that's related to his life and he tells you those stories and you're and you never think that man's bragging i mean you hear people come and they talk about i i mean me i did this and i did that brother brown could say that but you would never you'd never realize that he was bragging on himself because he's always bragging on god and but you do have to have a vessel that it goes through so that's why we you know we brag on brother dale we brag all these other brothers like brother brown said said you're a liar if you don't want if you don't want somebody packing you on the back and say you did a good job and now what the prophet said he said i want somebody to tell me i've done a good job and i do want somebody to tell me if i did a bad job but just make it real low and you know over in the corner somewhere so anyway so let's bow our heads i know we got all new we all have needs this morning thank you for coming lord this place is full leave it good to see you back there let's pray dear god thank you for this day that you give us father we pray that you would sanctify us now for this journey give us this day our daily bread lord bless your people father you be the one that speaks as the prophet said there this is this is your message lord it's not william branham's message but it's your message and you have delivered it through william branham to give it to the bride to dress her with father and that's what we want to talk about a little bit today lord how about you and your bride father forgive us of our sins and bless this day be the ones that are sick brother danny and sister joyce they're on vacation taking some time off lord jesus be with that family that lost the two young kids up there in ohio and comfort you're the only one that can do that we can say we understand but we don't but lord we just give it to a big god that never makes a mistake never have you ever made a mistake lord and you never make one in even in the future father just give us lord strength to finish the race lord be with our pastor and bless him keep him strong bless us each one father and just give us today our daily bread in jesus name amen we got a big god i have a hard time being me but i sure don't want to be god amen and have to make the decisions he's already made but you know what his decisions are perfect and being that his decisions is perfect then he can come down inside of us and make us perfect amen but we're still human we have a human part that we can't sometimes we don't understand the things that went on why god would do stuff but why why do we question god because he's perfect so every move he makes is perfect he doesn't make a mistake he's not he don't have a oops moment we have oops moments all the time because we're human but he doesn't whatever he does is in order and he knows what's best for everybody so we just leave it in god's hands and just say lord whatever you have for them or whatever you had for them then lord we know where they're at amen who is this son of man part 42 john 1 1 says in the beginning was the word word was with god in the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you may be seated the lord has blessed him to the reading of the word now we were we've been on this predestinated to adoption for for now months but that's okay uh i hope we broke it down enough to where we can understand a little bit more of of our this is nothing it's just a plain it's your christian journey it's a journey that god's given us and and you know what these things are required it's a requirement that we come to church it's a requirement that we read your bible it's a requirement that we study but it's a requirement that a minister stands in the pulpit and tries to give it to you smooth off the rough edges get everything kind of in order in line and then let god speak to you because today i'm not speaking to you i'm just talking to you but god's going to speak to your heart something that you need and we've been looking we we we run up the pyramid and now we're going to we we're back down at the bottom because i wanted to make sure and we'll talk about today where that foundation faith is real big you believe in faith because the bible says without faith is impossible to please god impossible to please god thereby we believe that god wrote a bible right yeah okay all right so also we are talking about this adoption and it's not your birth now we've been back on the birth because that's your first stage that's getting you started that's getting your foundation that's getting everything laid exactly right and brother bob was talking about just a few minutes ago i mean if you don't do what the bible says that's iniquity plain and simple because what you're looking at the word of god and you're not doing what it says that's iniquity and we all have that part as brother dale says until we get to the body change we're going to have a little piece of that that mystery of iniquity is that person that we oh he's out there in the denomination no that mystery of iniquity sitting right here today and it's in me and you in our spirit realm and and motivating us even if we're born again is everybody with me all right so like brother bobby put on that you can be you can be baptized with the holy ghost feel good say them in the message you can come to church and you can read your bible and you can listen to the prophet's message but if you're not born again you're going to hell because you're going to fall under that iniquity where you have been taught maybe you haven't been taught now see if you haven't been taught that then god can't hold you responsible for it but you have been taught in this church that it takes three stages for a birth justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost and over and over again we have told you that it's not that you can have all this and we read it many times before you can have a pentecostal joy but that's not all of it it gets pain now we do the same thing we get started in something and man we just like a house on a fire in a windy day and then all of a sudden a month later two months later life happens we make a we make a new year's resolution keep it about what maybe a month well that's humanity but it's not god god god makes a vow and it's his word and he doesn't ever break it and never will break it but what we've got to do is we've got to be sheep we've got to yield to that that's why i said before we you know we're looking at number 19 being baptized today but i want to ask you a question how many of those are going to continue on that's the decision you got to make if you continue on with god or if you let the cares of life or if you let this happen or that happened or this happened and then all of a sudden you disappear just like you've done before i hope that doesn't happen because you know what you're going to disappear one time and that mystery of iniquity is going to take over and you're going to stay out there and you're not going to be coming back in here everybody with me i'm just going to be playing today because this is the foundation if we don't get the foundation right you cannot build that house and god cannot work through your life unless you let him well i've done this being the message we don't have seniority in the message there's no seniority you've been a message two years and know as much as somebody knows in 50 years if you're sitting under the right teaching and if you yield yourself to the holy ghost amen because that's god that's god in the faith you have in that god god is ready to give it to us if we're ready to receive it all right so the first state let's look at the chart just for a minute we haven't pulled it up very very many times so remember now your adoption is not your birth so we pulled it apart and now we're at the birth part we're going to talk a little bit about a little more about that today but that's your chart that that is you that is your walk your christian in god that is what the the message of the hour to me has produced it's produced a new birth the correct way not under a false baptism not under a shaking a hand not under a write your name on a ledger somewhere and you've got an envelope sticking somewhere in a church but the new birth is as brother bob was talking about and we'll read in just a minute it's the birth of the word it's the birth of the word for your hour and that you will understand what's going on in the hour that you're living in all right i'm telling you if you are confused go back to the foundation well i can't understand what y'all are saying get born again obligated to do it he's obligated to tell you what we're saying he's not obligated to leave a child laying out somewhere in a desert and you'll say well there's the baby now he's obligated to nurture that baby if you'll let him so there's your there's your stature of a perfect man and we see that we've got a we've got to even go through these stages before we even get into this son of god revelation you see the bracket over there and what i mean by son of god revelation that's the new birth that's the new birth for your hour in your soul making you a son and daughter of god you are not a son and daughter of god until you're born again you are potentially a son and daughter of god but you are not a full-fledged son and daughter of god until you're born again read that right there because mans are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god we'll talk about that in just a minute but then you come up a lot higher and then we're going to have to talk about the son of god through the seven church ages we'll get into that a little bit later on a couple of sermons from now but then you got these virtues that you've got they're required to work in your life they're not just laying there as good words and it's not a list because you know what that could be a new year's resolution if you make it that right but if you make it a life a life listen sometimes i wish to god me and dad's talked about this sometimes i wish i could walk into service 30 minutes after i was supposed to i'm looking at everybody if you got an office in this church you need to be 30 minutes before the service in your seat praying because people are looking at you if you don't have an office then guess what be like be like what i want to be i want to be little some little yeah be quiet yeah right me anyway i want to be some little wallflower that comes over here and sits down and just worships god and goes back home that would be really nice but i ain't built that way i ain't built for that and you shouldn't be built for that either especially those of you that have a have been elevated to a place that that people look up to you what would it be if brotherdale coming here 30 minutes after the service started he's here for where everybody is and he's 82 years old what's your problem well get quiet that's all right stay quiet if you want to but you know what that's iniquity you know to be here and you're not well i've got this when he read those quotes a few minutes ago did you see any list that exempted you [Music] from that iniquity there was no exemption bob did you leave that out no it just said if you know to do better and don't do it it's iniquity i'm telling you get in or get out but sometimes i do wish i could i could sit and and go fishing and go hunting and and never have to worry about getting a sermon and never have to worry about your spirituality and never have to worry about the building never have to worry about special meetings never have to worry about bringing preachers in and i still do four or five jobs anyway so but i'm built for it i can do it i don't mind but sometimes it'd be nice to take a a brain vacation some of y'all have already checked out but the revelation of the son of god is is what we're talking about the new birth justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost was the same in every church age it was just there was a requirement for this age a requirement for this age and requirement for this age everybody with me all right then in the end time we see up there at the very top that was done away with the son of man was rejected back 2 000 years ago by the religious world crucified by the religious world and turned against by the religious world so brother ranum had to come to bring back the what the foundation but then teach us about the son of man god in human flesh that's what we'll talk about a little bit later but remember this god is not here at the moment physically in his form as he was 2 000 years ago he has left and came back to get into your flesh and to let your flesh do what the son of man did amen that's a requirement in this age luke 17 30. malcolm 4. you ever heard any of the inscriptions we got message believers here today don't we all right just want to make sure we didn't have a different crowd but the son of man revelation is different because it it contains a body change it contains knowing listen they didn't know so much about the mystery of iniquity during the church ages because they still by ignorance baptized in the name of father son holy ghost believed in a trinitarian doctrine believed in eternal hell believed all these things miracles were passed or gone and done away with that was what was eroded through the church ages even even the people that had the holy ghost everybody with me martin luther had the baptism of the holy ghost in his soul church age messenger that god used him to get the message to the people yet he was a trinitarian yet he baptized the name of father's only go holy ghost see he didn't get all the way out the prophet of god said in other words he didn't he got out of the catholic church but he didn't get all the catholic church out of him there was still some in there but now when the prophet of god comes he separates and it says look that's the mystery of iniquity that's knowing to do better that's why he would preach to those people he said you pentecostal women he said you get worse every year he was preaching the message of the hour he was preaching the bible and they were rejecting it but that's the son of man revelation so now that's why we've got all that but we want to change it back to number two and we want to go back down because i think we run away from there was a lot of questions that were asked because i jumped on up to the son of man and we should have stayed down here let's go to number two um brother anderson i want to thank brother anderson he has done a an outstanding job him and brother richard brother joe uh for bob the different ones we need to give them give them a big atta boy because uh that's a lot they do back there they don't listen to a lot of sermons i'm serious they have to either re-listen or or something because they're not they're back there working so what so you can sit here and listen and soak it in all right so here now we've come back to the bottom and that's what we're talking about right here for his men's are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god now listen you're not a son of god and justification you're not a son of god of sanctification you are son of god at the baptism of the holy ghost that's when god takes the old nature out and puts the new nature in we've been talking about that for a few weeks for you ever not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption now the spirit of adoption gets you started just like a baby and then you have to grow up to that other chart that we were at where you saw the full grown man inside that chart but that's what's required that we get to that in this church age wasn't required listen in the fourth church age if you just got to right there at the baptism of the holy ghost you didn't live very long 68 million got martyred just by saying that they're son and daughter of god but that was their age that was their box that was their spirit the anointing that they were under but you and i have to use thank god we use all seven anointings to get by pressures of this age everything that we got we used all seven church ages and their characteristics just to get through this time i mean folks listen it's a it's an honest fact that they're going to ask you we're going to be the most questioned people when we get to the other side how'd you make it we saw your age it was dark it was dark we couldn't see anything any hope any light there was nothing we could see we were just trying to fight through our age but man you've got not just a little devil you've got big devils 200 000 000 demons were released the prophet of god said the bible says on the bride well who's the bride us so you have to start at the bottom with faith but we're going to start with justification sanctification and then head to the baptism of holy ghost and i want to um to comment a little bit you know we talk about i'll talk about when i get finished in just a second we talk about a marriage and i was looking at yesterday you know we we said well a marriage when we marry jesus christ then we're born again well that's okay but let's back up just a little bit because you know what in that in that marriage journey lily zach in that marriage journey they're stages even though you jump up today and run to the just of the peace don't you even try it and get married there's a yeah that's right even though there's a journey to get there there's a journey and we'll talk about it in just a minute but let's get through this right here but we have received the spirit of adoption so who have you received we were talking about last sunday we'll look at in just a minute and sanctification you get a new spirit but you don't get the holy spirit you get a new spirit so that you can what contact god with and that you can live with yourself with now we're going to put that in the marriage valve so hang on just a second spirit itself bearing with hello somebody spirit itself bear witness with our spirit that we are the children of god children of god we all got to start as a baby look we saw most of you even even the twins were born in the church and i think zach wasn't but um esther was right that was here how old are you shut up but now he's not a baby now he's fixing to get married he's moved on he he's what he's come to a knowledge that he don't want to live his life by himself he's found a good woman a good lady good sister thank god amen but he started out as a baby we all started as babies and now we're grown up supposed to be grown up but if children than heirs because remember when you become a child of god even in the infant stage you're a son and daughter of god when this baby i'm going to talk about when this union comes of this marriage when a baby's born regardless if it lives two minutes it's still the son and daughter of who produced it amen everybody with me so that's what we're going to start with here in just a second if children then air so we're that child is an heir because he's part of the family so you're an heir right as you're as you're a child because i told you before in all of my journey and your journey too when we first come to the lord the lord was so gracious and just pouring out a blessing upon us he pour out a blessing you'd ask him something man you'd get it right there not now he asked for something now and he says wait a while i don't think you can handle it yet remember god's nose are the best yeses you'll ever get right because he knows you'll mess it up if he gives it to you so thank god i'm uh i know the bible tells us if if and then if we don't have troubles and trials we're bastard children so we're going to have troubles and trials even when god gives you something all right so let's look at justification but oh heirs and join us for christ if so be that we suffer with him that may be also be glorified so if you come to the baptism of the holy ghost and you get the new birth in your soul you are going to come to a glorified condition you may have to die and go by the grave or you may be standing as today we're standing alive and remain and we're going to be glorified on our two feet with not anything to do with death now see that's not here that's up there everybody with me that's why the headstone had to come it brought christ back to the earth to not just anoint your soul but anoint your spirit and your body all three and and we should want that when we get sick and tired of being sick and tired all right so justification let's go real quick romans 3 verse 24 is being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in christ jesus because remember we can't justify ourself has to be someone just to justify us we can't chop off our past life but god can chop off our past sins i mean chop it off in our brain now we don't go do that anymore or we didn't get justified when god has set forth to be who god has set forth to be a perpetuation what through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past not for future sins you can't get remission for sins you haven't done yet we're not catholics said before that's why the uh that's why the mob loved to be all were catholic they go in say 10 hail marys and say well i'm going to kill four people tomorrow night priest is going to say well okay here's some holy water go do what you need to do it was convenient for them that's not us though remission of sins that are passed and then what does he do he takes those sins of the past and he puts them in the sea of god's forgetfulness he doesn't remember any anymore because he has justified you all right he's justified you because you've come to a place that god i'm finished with my past life don't want to do this anymore don't want it to be a part of me anymore everybody with me sanctification matthew 12 43 says when the unclean spirit is going out of a man he walketh through dry places seek his rest and find is none now i want you to look at this just for one second just i'm gonna put a big like paul paul would make a point and then there's a parenthesis in the interpolates for about four four verses then he gets back on his subject so i'm going to interpolate for about five minutes here this is in your soul everybody with me under sanctification right there that is the unclean spirit going out of your soul but now when we get to the sanctification in the pyramid that's not in your soul that's those demons that are in your spirit realm because if you're born again he can't be in the inner man he has to start working on the next guy the spirit realm so everybody with me so remember that when we get to it there is a stage of this scripture scripture has compound meaning right so when an unclean spirit has gone out of a man he walketh through dry places secret rest find us none then he said i will return into my house from whence i came out and when he has come he finds it empty swept and garnished then go ahead and taketh himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself and then what is that that's what brother bible told me that's the iniquity part he comes back into your soul because you let him back in he comes back into your soul and then what the last state of that man is worse than the first because now he don't have but one he had one demon now he's got eight of them seven plus him that's inside your soul and making you just as happy and setting a message church and my hair is long my dress is long somebody all need to work on that and then i'm saved uh be careful it's when the word is quickened in your heart when the word of this hour is quickened in your heart and you don't deny it or walk away from it you can't walk away from this word of god and be born again call this word to word then go ahead and take it seven other spirits more wicked than they enter and what dwell there i don't want no demons to dwell in me spirit our soul amen but thank god though if we take this by stages in the new birth when we get to in just a second in the new birth that's what burns that old dynamic nature off of you doesn't kill your soul we don't believe in two souls we don't believe in having three or four you got one that god gave you when you were born and by the adamic nature by your by your carnal mind when you get 12 or 13 or 14 years old the age of accountability satan starts working on that and he's got right here look what it says my house right here i will return into my house because you were born in sin you were born wrong if you're born wrong then guess what you got to get right somewhere if you want to get born again everybody with me the state of the person is what more worse than the first that's what brother the mystery of inequity iniquity brother brown said was a hideous sin not just saying a hideous sin because you're looking right at it you look right down at the bible and it tells you to be a church on sunday and wednesday read the bible it tells you not to do this not to do that i want y'all to listen something real quick i'm gonna make a make a point everybody loves grace hey man do you know what grace really is in simple layman terms there's a law of god that you got to go by everybody with me he has a law he has 10 commandments he's got the numbers deuteronomy even in matthew mark luke and john all right everybody wake up and listen for a minute matthew mark luke and john you've got all you've got all this do's and don'ts all right now you know how that works because remember god can't change his word he can't make exceptions unless he makes them everybody with me all right so we're going to go down here today and we're going to get on this road and we're going to go all the way down to that four-way stop right there in the middle of town we're familiar with it all of us pretty much now if there's a cop sitting there and we decide to roll through it you have come under the law and you're going to meet that law he's going to be in your window going i need to see your license and registration please right because you broke the law everybody with me on that you broke the law all right now what is grace now if if we have a parade or a an extra circumstance a a funeral everybody with me if that cop standing there at that four-way stop and he's doing this that stop sign goes out of existence because the man with the power of the law is saying you can come on by how many times you've been at a traffic light and you've stopped to the traffic light and you know better than to go into that traffic light because number one you're gonna get hit probably and number two a cop or something or now they just take your picture and send you a bill oh how do you all know that so anyway um confession time good for the soul but there's your stop sign and you're stan you're at the stop sign and listen it turns green you get ready to go but there's a cop standing there because there's a funeral procession going through or there's a parade going through now you have full right by that law to go but somebody is stopping you with an extra special circumstance but now remember though you know what greasy grace is greasy gracious said well shoot if i if i could go under it one time i'd just go under it again no that's greasy grave because when you when that circumstance leaves you guys still stop at the stop sign same way up here then i'm going to take it down but that's what god done god stood and he intermediated he he stood for you and said i know you got into trouble come on somebody i know you got into trouble i didn't let you but i didn't make you but i knew you would and i made a law that made sure you didn't go through that stop sign every time but the circumstances changed the guy that wrote the law is standing at the intersection he's going i know you didn't mean to do that come on through oh that's great to me that's the greatest that's a just a lamest term example of grace but listen remember like i said before don't go down here and go through it again when there's not a circumstance that the person that wrote the law standing there that's greasy grace greasy grace is well i got by with the first time i'll get by with again now you know what god's always had cameras up every move you make you think man's got cameras god's been on wi-fi for millions of years he hasn't needed a he hasn't needed a string or or a plug-in or anything he doesn't need any of that he's the master of the internet google ain't got nothing on my god amen because you know what he told us i'm gonna read you the scripture in a little while if i get to it that he said if he when he gave you the holy ghost he'd bring things you'll remember what do we do if we don't get our remembers we go google oh okay but not with god but listen second timothy nevertheless the foundation of god standeth sure having this seal the lord knoweth them that are his and let everyone that nameth the name of christ depart from iniquity you didn't read that one this morning bob you missed one but in a great house he's only got 30 minutes guys okay but in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver but wood and earth we talked about the potters last time to honor some to dishonor if a man therefore purge himself from these he shall be a vessel unto honor sanctified this is somebody that's got getting the iniquity out this is the person that's saying i don't want to live that life anymore i don't want to do what i used to do anymore i want god to take over in my life and him be the first one i ask not everybody else sanctified in meat for the what for the master's use remember sanctification is clean and set aside for service not put in service yet because god's not going to use you until he's got you all cleaned up and got his spirit inside of you because that's the control factor sanctify the meat from the masters used and what prepared unto every good work we were reading i just everybody knows jesus this carrot was justified by faith he was even sanctified so there's judah says carrot preaching the gospel casting out devils healing the sick his soul was black as such and you know what he done he made a decision to turn against the lord and he couldn't go back his iniquity carried him to a tree and he hung himself all right sanctification he gave you a new spirit now that spirit isn't god's spirit that's your spirit god gives you a new spirit then he says i'll put my spirit in you but the thing god has to do is give you a new spirit make your nature a little more gentle and settle down or he couldn't even live with you so he has to get you fixed up first before he can come in i'll give you a new spirit then you take him anyway anywhere you go all kinds of places he's got to get you fixed up so you can entertain him right today we're entertaining god everybody all right with that amen you come to get something from god yes we came to get something from god how do we entertain god we worship him he's our author he's our creator he's one he gives us everything he gives us the breath that we're breathing right now whether we deserve it or not because the whole world's doing that right now they're breathing under god's privilege of being a human being so that's when you're on the first one your first altar but when you hide away get his spirit then the holy spirit none other than god himself comes and dwells in you and then there's something about you the neighbor loves you the people likes you now let's get to the baptism of holy ghost is what we were talking about last week we'll talk a little bit more but i want you to realize it's not just a baptism of the holy ghost it's the new birth because remember there is kind of a little difference to that because you can have the baptism of the holy ghost every day on your on your spirit and die and go to hell that's you just saw the quote but you can't have the new birth in your soul because see you new birth doesn't listen to me real just listen the new birth doesn't affect your body the new birth doesn't affect your spirit sure it does when you get inside but listen if you don't get a new birth no you're still looking at the first one but god made what he made grace to give you a new birth in your soul where it matters that's where it matters that it's down in the inside the inside he can't give you a new birth on your spirit realm he's got to give you a new birth in your soul because what comes forth listen we'll talk about just a second you can have a child and and god forbid if no spirit goes into it that's not a human being sorry the prophet of god tells us it's wiggling muscles just like an animal until god puts a soul inside that being then he becomes a person everybody with me so you can't then be born again in your spirit you've got to be born again in your soul and only god can do that see you have purified your souls and what how can you purify your soul in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and by this forever for all fleshes is grass and all glory man's a flower of grass the grass withered the flower therefore falleth away but the word of god the word of the lord didn't do it forever this is the word which the gospel which i preach unto you now let's look at marriage just for a minute is everybody okay just kind of coast for a second here all right now take all away all the being married to christ and be in the bride and let's just let's just break it down when you come to justified condition what does that do think with me a minute justification chops off your past sins chops off your past life everybody with me all right i'm gonna slow down just a second all right now in justification what are you doing you're getting your chat ch your sins chopped off what are you doing when you say will you marry me that's what you did right and since y'all fixing to get married i'm thinking y'all for example because everybody all we've been married all 40 50 80 years and y'all fixin to jump into this thing called marriage is that okay you're not gonna paint on me are you okay i know lily's not i know but zach might but you might have vowed to each other right now what did you vow you vowed to get rid of your past life you vowed to get rid of those old boyfriends no more old boyfriends anymore not going back to those places i used to go everybody with me you vowed a vow to god that you're not going to do what you used to do and now god is so gracious he can wipe that away now me and you've got to deal with it sorry we're humans we're in our brain or in other words we can't chop off and say i never did that you can't do that in your natural flesh only in your soul can god wipe that away everybody with me so in your marriage you make a vow and when i come to justification i vow to god look god i'm going to come to church i'm going to get myself around somebody of light precious faith i'm not going to go back to that place i used to be so when you vow a vow when june and i made a vow i didn't go keep running around all over the place hello somebody i vowed myself to her and god vows itself to you in justification he says if you'll continue if you'll not break your vow i'll not break mine because i promise you i'm not going to break mine you might break yours but i'm not going to break mine that's why justification unclean spirit goes out but you still have that same desire oh [Music] it's hard to change in 15 minutes especially when you got that old i want to go out i want to be with my friends that's why marriages don't last now they do more in the message but they don't last because you don't sit there and talk about it enough to get to know each other so when did i get to learn to know god not at the baptism of the holy ghost no why wait that long get to know each other now y'all spending more time together than you used to right i mean talking and oh i love you right it's a love affair listen even in justification it's a love of love affair between you and god because those who he's justified he's already glorified god knows whether you're going to continue on or not you don't but if you'll stay in that same channel stay in that furrow stay in that road even with god god i want you to marry me so bad he'll say well stop going to the bar stop going to those friends stop watching that on tv stop reading that book because they're getting ready to be joined and you're joining two people actually you're joining two families family of god and family on earth everybody with me we're talking in layers here i want you to look at your natural marriage so in justification then all your past is gone now what's sanctification in your marriage you're not married yet but as you get closer to that day that you're going to get married what do you do i just read it to you the unclean spirit goes out but now i'm not talking about that as far as natural but you do talk to each other you converse i want to confess that i've got this problem i want to confess and i want to get this what this demon out i was just reading in there where brother brown was talking about if a woman vows a vow it doesn't tell her husband everything or he don't tell her everything then the vows the vows been what don't wait with it's a false vow a lot of people have made a false vow to god and they don't even get born again they don't even come into the covenant of marriage because listen why one more time all y'all know what i said about marion you don't marry for love at first because you don't know that pray i don't care if you've been dating for two years hey some things i found out about june after we've been dating for a year and a half something good some bad same way with me the same way with all of us yeah brother john durant's going she's making sure alicia doesn't see it but no listen what is the main problem with marriage you're not open enough you're just not open commitment what's the first thing i do when i get mad i shut up y'all don't believe that she's there she but see we're intimate we know each other right i just be quiet and she does too until until she like a pressure cooker but that's getting to know your spouse that's getting to know god in your walk justification chop off it i'm not doing that no more honey it's just you you and you and nobody else you're sweating you're it you and nobody else isn't that right what do you do though when you get when you come into a justified condition you get what you get mule blinders on you don't go looking at all this other stuff you've got only one thing on your mind my darling that i'm fixing to intimately know i want to intimately know and you start off your marriage with a little bit of lust sorry that's the way it is because true love is knowing all knowing everything and true love is what a development and i'm talking about i'm talking about feeling love but listen i got below the same way on our side what i was thinking about on our side we just don't jump up and get the new birth and everything's here i just told you you were a child you're a baby you don't understand everything but if there's no surprises listen god's not going to give you any surprises you might give him some but it ain't going to surprise him either because he knows it too that's why he'll only give you the new birth if he knows you're going to take it and use it and can go with it but being married sometimes we don't talk before the marriage find out all the little intricacies and all the this and that and the other because you're going to find out a lot i'm telling you when you get married it's like like the guy said one time you know the mother-in-law looks at the sun and says he says i i can't stand her no more i'm gonna get a divorce she said she said son she's just a nice girl she's really pretty she's a nice girl he said mama you don't have to live with her right because there's certain things you find out after you get married am i making any headway here so justification is chopping off your past sins it's chopping off everything and focusing on god because in sanctification what do you get you get a new spirit it's called your wife everybody with me it's called your wife because that's another person sitting there didn't i just read the whole brother brown said to entertain him you get a new spirit to entertain him the spou him the the bridegroom he's now got a bride to deal with and i don't mean it that way he's got a bride to deal with though and then what happens you start cutting off all the unclean spirits goes out start chopping it away you know for how long you've been dating a year and a half 11 months okay but when you first met each other what was it hey how are you doing fine i'm i'm you didn't know a thing about each other right see the only good thing about this relationship with god is he knows everything from the get-go but you got to confess it on this end or you're in iniquity so if you get all of it out all the unclean spirit goes out of a man don't let him back in because you're fixing to fill yourself with your spouse and i'm required to take care of her now i wasn't required to take care of her before i'm required to take care of her you're required to take care of your wife i promise you one thing i still believe the bible when it says how you treat your wife is how god's going to treat you i would not be in your shoes maybe that's the cause we got the problems that we got now am i good so in sanctification here we are we're we're not at the altar yet because remember what is the new birth the new birth is a coming together and a production of something everybody with me it's a union that's going to produce something it's going to produce children how did you get here a union between your mama and your daddy how did you get here spiritually a union between your mama which is the word and your daddy which is in heaven coming through that man right there brought a lot of y'all burst a lot of y'all into the body of christ from that man right there spiritual multiplication because of what a marriage but before you're married man you've got all these things that you am i right you worry about stuff that you didn't have to worry about same way when you come to sanctification when you're not even born again you're still getting to know god ain't that why i said it he'll give you a new spirit so that you can what welcome god and be able to live with yourself because you got another life coming in you got something coming in and god knows what he's doing but you don't thank god we got a husband that knows what he's doing we're floundering around down here still after 43 years jim shakes your head sometimes well once in a while once in the morning while in the afternoon it may but you know what we've done though we've accepted the challenge you two have accepted a challenge god accepts the challenge he wants a bride he wants somebody he can birth others from that's why it gives you the new birth that's why i read the scripture where it says you cannot know about what i'm talking about without jesus christ being in your soul without an intimate relationship with god you cannot understand because look i'm talking to these two they're getting ready to get married me and you know exactly what's going on bob and martin know exactly what's going on but michael's going what what what what y'all talking about because he's not married yet yet right because he he doesn't know what we're talking about just like you don't know what i'm talking about if you're not born again right because michael's sitting there going what do you mean i gotta i gotta understand that yeah you do and then you gotta keep her till you die the vow does stay till death do his part and that doesn't mean if you kill him that makes you a murderer and you don't go to heaven either so just be careful but everybody understand what i'm saying you you think about your courtship and you think about your courtship with then then if you're not born again go through that courtship that you were that you went through everybody has except for the ones that haven't got married yet everybody's went to a courtship thomas is going i still won't play basketball you know michael's not born again i mean it's okay right right you're born again you still want to play basketball but you got another life involved you got to ask your wife if you can go play basketball i used to go hunting all the time till i got married and i had to ask my wife who i could go well i kind of told her i'm sorry i know it's all good yeah i know i'm still i'm gonna get right you have nothing else to throw at me either so i'm gonna stand over here can't throw it away you thought we were talking to these girls but we understand each other but now listen once you get married there's two people coming together and you become intimate and everybody understands what i'm saying so i said try to preserve your body the best you can try to do the best you can because that would be so same way with you and god be a virgin be a virgin when you marry god not having all that filth that you got to ask forgiveness all the time because you know what even when you get mad you're gonna have to ask forgiveness again and again and again and again one more time again and again so you asking forgiveness is not over with but marriage is beautiful so when we come to the baptism of the holy ghost it's beautiful listen it revolutionized my life it doesn't matter if there was another spirit came in me because see it's not that new spirit it's the holy spirit so now he and i can be intimate because i'm his bride we can be intimate with god he'll let us in places that we never were you know you're not going to get in sister lena you're not going to get into a place and you say i'm married but you're not you got to prove that you're married wedding band of grace you got to prove you can get into a certain place listen let me just be honest i'm going to try to make this vanilla when i get married got married to june there wasn't another person in the room you understand what i'm saying everybody got me you didn't bri i didn't bring a visitor that's our problem we don't want to let go of the past we bring the visitors and we want god to be intimate with us and we still all got this and that and the other to deal with at sanctification everybody with me are you listening to what i'm saying am i making sense i just thought about this this morning i thought man it's just just like a marriage because now we look christ in the bride and all that's fine that's okay but you gotta get over here and get born again first you gotta be born again not a corruptible seed but of incorruptible seed but you really don't know about a marriage if you've never been married before but we got a heavenly father we've got a bridegroom that knows all about it and he knows whether you're going to stay the course but you know what it's sanctification even if he don't know if he knows you're not going to stay the course he'll let you continue on through sanctification but if you don't get it filled guess what's going to happen another husband's going to come back if you don't get sealed in sister regina's welcome to my home anytime she wants to well not exactly well now i say that you know why because she's not my wife but i can't say that to june it is her house right and lord please don't let regina and sister uh trudy get in your house trudy collins they'll make your power bill go up 100 a month come home one time thought my house was on fire and it was regina and i know they might have been scared of the dark but i could hear the meter spinning when i got out of the car i said turn these lights off you know what regina said i told her hitting at the devil and i told her isn't that what you said judy was like told me you know and here they go you know some demons arguing with each other you know what i mean them demons arguing with each other same way with us you bring something to light you bring something to light in your life and then demons go to fighting you know what just back off and let them fight let your husband take care of him because when my when the husband of that house walks in the door what'd i do i said y'all paying a power bill this month cut them lights off right good man of the house but remember if they would have done it in their house i couldn't have said anything because it's not my house that's why this vessel needs to be god's and when it's god's we reverence that house that's why we do the things of god that's why we don't cut our hair that's why we don't do the things we used to do it's not because it's written in the bible yes it's written in the bible but it's something we do out of love it's something we do out of love you don't know you never know a love for a woman unless you're married to one oh i've got this girlfriend well be careful unless you're intimately married and spend time you don't know that person y'all know what i'm talking about but once you come together and and and you work on this it's kind of like shonda pierce said the other day you know the the girl that's a comedian christian comedian she said you know she said when you first get married your husband's laying there and he goes she said that's kind of cute but 30 years later get out of here get away from me what things change lily you got that to look forward to but now listen so the qualities i wrote myself a note the quirks the likes and the dislikes that's the unclean spirit in your relationship with your spouse all that's got to be pushed out because you know what it's two of you now it's not just me and it's my no two of you working together everybody with me on that all right same way with god we know who the husband is but listen we're a bride we've got to get ourself ready as the bible tells us amen we got to get ourself ready the five wise virgins were dressed and ready to go five foolish were two but the five wives had the holy ghost and they were getting ready to be intimate with their bridegroom the other five didn't know anything about that because they weren't ready to get intimate they thought they were close enough they went ahead and put all their garments on they already put there they had lamps too they just didn't have any oil they didn't go to the right place to get it but now listen just for a second then we'll close i'll pick the rest this up this afternoon this will be 42a and this afternoon will be 42b because i'm only down three quotes because look let me read this right here and then i'll make comment and then we'll close then in dispensation the fullness of times he might gather together and won all things in christ i'm not finished with the marriage yet hang on because there's got to be a consummation and at that consummation there's got to be a union and then there's got to be something that produces out of that one thing in christ both which are in heaven which on earth even in him and also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him what our bridegroom who worketh all things after the council of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory first trusted in christ and whom he also trusted after after you got married hello somebody the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance listen when you get married when when brother zach and sister lily gets married that's the earnest of their life it's a down payment they put a down payment that they're going to live together and then if there's going to be a a union then you can produce a child from that everybody with me on that i said you can i'm not i don't like this get married and get pregnant all at one time i just it just it just messes your life up a little bit so anyway god it's god's providence then that's okay you know like i said i'm not i'm not i'm i have a hard time being me i don't want to be god okay i have a hard time being me so i i'm not going to do that and stepping away but just be wise you know what talk about it talk about it okay not on the first date how many kids you want to have we all even had coffee yet watching all y'all watching you watching we're getting a life lesson but i told you a long time ago if you can't see your walk of god with god in your daily in your life from your baby all the way to now then you're meant you've missed it how simple is that if you've come from your baby drinking milk eating meat going through life you know like this of course mendel about 40. they're like but and but what but then you what then you turn your focus on one thing not all them old boyfriends and girlfriends not all them old places you went to there's somebody caught your attention oh he's a nice looking guy his word is true he's eternal he's beautiful he's the rose of sharon the lily is a valley he's a bright morning star he's good when i'm bad he's good when i'm bad he provides my needs i want to focus myself on that person because the world folks they see the husband of the world and they focus in their life on him debauchery lying stealing cheating whoring what name it right but something has turned me to see my lover to see the one i want to fall in love with because i got to get to know him first amen same way with all of us we got to know our spouse first before we fell in love with him i'm telling you i'm sorry that's exactly what happened same way with this right here that statue of perfect man is nothing more than your married life once you get married at the bottom that's your married life going through all the way to the headstone that all right even if we don't get the rest of this finish it's 11 52. but listen let's look at this though there's a union i wrote myself a note a union cleaned and set aside for service because you know what not playing with the world no more right you you focus like i said you focused on one person zach you're going to turn and look at her on the day you get married now i've never been to a wedding where they face away from each other right i've never been to one where they look at each other and go i don't know about that no you're going down the aisle going oh yeah finally all right he's the one i hope we did that i know some may have made it halfway down the altar and turn around but um usually when they get right up here they're standing in front of each other i couldn't tell you they said there was 200 and some people at my wedding back in 1978 and then blah blah blah i don't even remember who was in it i just remember that when they opened that door back there there come my bride and i want to be real honest with you i had a girlfriend sitting in the in the sanctuary jim knows that i mean but i wouldn't did i couldn't even remember their name i knew who she was though because she was fixing to come right here and we were getting ready to form a union we had cleaned ourselves up she had got herself ready but did they look at me when i came out with a preacher but charlie woodby was the preacher dad was my best man we all come out and there's not even any music jeffrey remember we came out yeah they didn't care about us they didn't care if we had anything on i told him i said look all these people are naked don't worry about it well he was about to fall i was holding him he was going like this i hope we all get drunk like that when we when we meet our spouse the holy ghost you can't stand up that's what makes when you get to the union when you get the holy ghost it'll make you wobble it made them wobble on the day of pentecost didn't it thought they was drunk but i told jeffrey i said don't worry son i said just pretend all these people are naked and you'll be fine well they happened to leave the microphone on while i said that so everybody in that methodist church heard it so anyway but they really i mean we come walking out and you know the people are kind of just sitting there they're going [Applause] but boy went out boom boom boom boom boom boom boom when that door open what happened is that not the song no i always thought it was dum dum dum dum dum dum dum anyway but what happened huh oh yeah exactly that's what i mean but when they started playing the wedding march what happened everybody gets up and they turn that way right because it was the bride's day the bride the groom they didn't care nothing about him they just knew that bride it was her day and there was going to be a union afterwards and that union sometimes produces a child so now let's go to the new birth everybody with me because when when a man and a wife gets together and they participate have a baby are they getting ready to have a baby and she says i'm pregnant what do you do you're expecting right you used to we couldn't even stay pregnant no you just said oh she's expecting expecting what but that's what it is you respect yeah in the family way you're expecting something to happen you're expecting that baby to come out you're expecting a birth when you get in that union with god you're expecting a birth you're expecting a new birth that you've never experienced before but remember the life doesn't go in that baby till it's born that's why we're children of god when we're born again sure we're potential in justification and sanctification but we can fall off we can turn around and run away we can we can end this wedding we can say i don't love you anymore there's something happen there's something going on because remember that's sora the seed the tares remember where boy yeah i plant my sick wow they just preached too long y'all won't talk about long preachers and it's almost 12 o'clock go to spoken word tabernacle where lily goes or used to go brother steven to give you about two and a half hours won't he three hours the last one was three cause i was watching it because she was singing on it three hours and he told him he said i hope you all slept well last night because we're gonna be here a while but when the word of god is coming forth i really don't care so the union real quick because it is 1158. the union produces what produces a child but you're expecting do you come to church expecting do you come to church with expectation that something's going to happen somebody's going to get burst somebody's going to get new life somebody's going to get their healing somebody's going to get their salvation somebody's going to get their demons cast out or do you just come to church because i told you to please don't ever come back if that's it please don't ever come back if you're here because i told you to if there's not a desire listen ladies there was a desire in your heart to have that baby not leave it in there it's normal to have children but it don't go past nine months you can't hold them for
