[3:04] I I think I
[3:06] said since I'm getting a little bit
[3:08] older,
[3:12] Somebody's always doing something to
[3:14] help
[3:15] me. This
[3:17] morning I put on a pair of shoes that
[3:20] didn't fit
[3:21] right. So when I got here, I tell him,
[3:24] "Brother Wade, I need somebody to do me
[3:26] a favor." He said, "What is it?" And I
[3:28] told him, he said, "Well, I'll do it."
[3:29] So thank the
[3:31] pastor went and got my good pair of
[3:33] shoes put on.
[3:37] So it it's just a blessing that you have
[3:40] people that's willing to help you. Amen.
[3:43] That's right. Brother brother Joseph
[3:46] carried the old pair back and put them
[3:47] in the truck. So I just thank everybody
[3:52] that do anything for me through the
[3:55] goodness of God. Amen. That's right.
[3:58] We're going to read this morning from
[4:02] Deuteronomy 29:es
[4:10] 1-4. Let us pray. Pray. Dear Lord Jesus,
[4:14] most kind, merciful heavenly father, we
[4:17] thank you Lord for your goodness, for
[4:19] the small things and the great things
[4:21] that you do for us. God, you do it
[4:23] through your love. And we pray that we
[4:25] can never do the same thing for others,
[4:28] God, that you do for us. Lord, we ask
[4:30] you to guide us this morning. Bless us.
[4:33] Touch this service, Lord, and bless
[4:35] every heart, Father. There are
[4:37] some that have a need of spiritual need.
[4:40] God, we ask you to bless it and grant
[4:42] unto them what they have need of. There
[4:44] are some that have body needs, Lord,
[4:47] physical. Lord, we pray that you would
[4:49] grant it in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[4:52] Amen. Amen. Amen.

[5:02] Deuteronomy 29
[5:06] 1-15. These are the words of the
[5:08] covenant which the Lord commanded Moses
[5:11] to make his children of Israel in the
[5:13] land of Moab beside this covenant which
[5:18] he made with them in her. And Moses
[5:22] called unto all Israel and said unto
[5:25] them, Ye have seen all that the Lord did
[5:28] before your eyes in the land of Egypt
[5:31] unto Pharaoh and unto all his servants
[5:34] and unto all his land. The great
[5:38] temptations which thine eyes have seen,
[5:41] the signs and these great
[5:44] miracles. Yet the Lord hath not given
[5:47] you a heart to perceive and eyes to see
[5:50] and ears to hear unto this day.
[5:54] And I have led you 40 years in the
[5:58] wilderness. Your clothes are not waxing
[6:01] all upon you, and thy shoes is not
[6:05] waxing old upon thy foot.
[6:08] Ye have not eaten bread, neither have
[6:11] you drunk wine or strong drink, that ye
[6:14] might know that I am the Lord God.
[6:18] And when ye came unto the place of
[6:22] Sion, the king of Hbon and O and the
[6:27] king of Bashan came out against us unto
[6:32] Bal, and we smoked them.
[6:35] And we took their land and gave it for
[6:38] an inheritance unto the Rubenites and to
[6:42] the tribe of Manasse.
[6:46] Keep therefore the words of this
[6:49] covenant and do them that ye may prosper
[6:52] in all that ye do.
[6:56] You stand this day, all of you, before
[6:58] the Lord your God, your captains of your
[7:02] tribes, your elders, and your officers
[7:05] with all the men of Israel,
[7:08] your little ones, your wives, and the
[7:11] strangers that is in thy
[7:14] camp, from the hu of thy wood unto the
[7:18] drawer of thy water,
[7:21] that thou Enter into the Lord thy God,
[7:26] and into his oath, which the Lord thy
[7:28] God maketh with thee this day,
[7:32] that ye may establish thee today for a
[7:37] people unto th himself, and that ye may
[7:41] be unto God, unto thee a God, as them
[7:45] that has said unto thee, and as he hath
[7:48] sworn unto thy father, to Abraham, to
[7:52] Isaac and Jacob.
[7:56] Do I make this covenant and this
[8:00] but with him that
[8:03] stand this day before the Lord our God
[8:07] and unto him that is not with us this
[8:12] day. Amen. God bless. You may be seated.
[8:15] Amen. Amen.

[9:24] brother Bob say this morning. He said,
[9:25] "We left Egypt. We're not going back.
[9:28] We're not going back by the grace of the
[9:30] Lord." And that goes right along with
[9:31] what brother Collie just read. Leaving
[9:34] Egypt. Praise the Lord Jesus. And we say
[9:36] goodbye world. We're say no longer with
[9:39] you. Amen. As I was getting the songs

[13:34] I thank the Lord. I thank the Lord for
[13:36] my wife. You know, we, as you guys know,
[13:38] we met in high school and been met in
[13:40] high school. So went through all those
[13:41] teenage years and then we went to
[13:43] college together and um wow that was a
[13:47] you can imagine being 19 to 21 and
[13:50] college age and we were young and out
[13:53] there and and um I thought I knew
[13:56] everything but realized I didn't know
[13:59] nothing but God got a hold of us on that
[14:02] college campus. My goodness. And it was
[14:05] a transformation. I tell you it was a
[14:08] transformation man. in and she was by my
[14:10] side. You know, we were packing that
[14:12] Bible. First they knew me as a wild kind
[14:14] of guy. Thought I knew everything and
[14:17] next thing we were packing that Bible.
[14:18] We would walk in that cafeteria with our
[14:20] Bibles and slam them on the
[14:23] table. It was over. That's the whole
[14:26] thing. It was over. Friends was like,
[14:28] "What? What's going on? What are y'all
[14:29] doing?" We like, "Hey, we getting
[14:31] married. This this is done." I had
[14:34] friends, female friends, like, "Don't
[14:35] don't do it." I said, "It's over. It's
[14:38] finished." I know this is the one that
[14:40] God has ordained for me. It was finished
[14:44] and we've been on that journey ever
[14:45] since. It's been a glorious journey.
[14:48] It's been a journey certainly of
[14:49] battles, but every single one of them
[14:52] we've won. And we thank the Lord and we
[14:55] won it because God paid a debt. We all
[14:58] owed a debt that we could not pay. We
[15:00] couldn't pay it. We couldn't solve all
[15:02] of the history and the drama that
[15:04] happened from the Garden of Eden all the
[15:06] way down. How could we recover from all
[15:08] of that? It's impossible to recover from
[15:11] all of that. We couldn't afford it. But
[15:14] he paid it for us that we could be free
[15:16] and we can win this battle. Amen. Let's

[28:15] changing
[28:16] me, changing
[28:18] you. Oh, we have
[28:21] come with open hearts. Oh, let the word
[28:26] of God. Sing it to me one more time.
[28:30] Word of God is ever
[28:34] true. Changing me and changing you.
[28:39] We have
[28:41] come with open hearts. Oh, let the word
[28:46] of
[28:46] God impart.
[28:49] Amen. God bless you. Good to be in the
[28:51] house of the Lord. Thank you all for
[28:53] coming today. We sure appreciate it.
[28:55] That was some good singing. Good Sunday
[28:57] school.
[29:00] Just a good day to be a Christian. Boy,
[29:03] if we weren't Christians, think what we
[29:05] would be. Where would we be? That's what
[29:09] the song says. Where would we be if we
[29:12] didn't have the
[29:13] Lord? Erin, I think you probably need to
[29:16] turn the air on a little
[29:18] bit. We got a lot of bodies in here. So,
[29:23] um, thank y'all all for the ones that
[29:24] came yesterday. We sure had a wonderful
[29:26] time. Thanks to the sisters and the
[29:27] brothers for helping and um, and we had
[29:31] a good time. We had the kids had a good
[29:32] time and and uh, us young kids, old kids
[29:36] had a good time, too. So, it's good to
[29:38] see Sister Charlotte back with
[29:44] us. But as often happens, we have a lot
[29:47] of food left over from yesterday. So, if
[29:49] you would like to stay today and eat hot
[29:52] dogs, as brother Ryan said, hot dogs,
[29:54] chili,
[29:56] sloth, drink, plenty of
[30:00] dessert. You're very welcome to stay.
[30:02] So, how many of you would I think June
[30:05] wanted to kind of get a count? How many
[30:06] was going to stay today to eat? Don't be
[30:08] bashful. Don't be bashful. Don't be
[30:10] bashful. Don't be
[30:12] bashful. Don't be bashful. That's not
[30:14] enough. Don't be
[30:16] bashful. How do you interpret that,
[30:18] Brother Manuel? Don't be
[30:20] bashful. Brother Carlos, you understand
[30:22] that? Yeah, that's what I thought. Don't
[30:24] be bashful. All right. Probably I think
[30:27] there's 101 people in here. About
[30:29] probably 75 or so. So, we still got
[30:32] plenty. Don't worry, we have plenty to
[30:35] eat. Please stay. And the ones you're
[30:36] going to stay over and go shoot this
[30:39] afternoon, the instructor will be there
[30:41] at 4:00 at my house. Um, if you've
[30:44] already um participated, then you can
[30:47] come. But if you have not, then he will
[30:51] be able to help you um with your uh he
[30:54] helped a lot of us uh with the many tips
[30:57] and and things. That's why he's an
[30:59] instructor. That's why he does it. Uh he
[31:01] does it to help people. And it really
[31:02] did help a lot of us. while we were down
[31:05] there. So, Brother Aaron, you'll be
[31:06] speaking for us Wednesday night, Lord
[31:08] willing. And uh we appreciate Brother
[31:11] Aaron. We appreciate it. Good to see.
[31:13] Always good to see. It's always a it's
[31:15] not a little hole that's left. It's a
[31:16] big one when he's on here. So, well,
[31:18] praise the Lord.
[31:19] Anyhow, your sister cackled. Everybody
[31:23] else just laughed. She cackled. So,
[31:26] anyway, remember Bella? She's on about a
[31:29] two week trip. So, Lord be with her.
[31:32] Luis and Christine are leaving on the
[31:34] 15th. They're taking her to the airport
[31:36] today is why they're not here in the
[31:37] air. They're taking her to Charlotte to
[31:39] the airport. So, that's why they're not
[31:40] here today. And just remember, Louise
[31:42] and Christine will be gone from the 15th
[31:46] to the 21st to Honduras
[31:48] uh for a youth camp, I think it is. So,
[31:51] just remember these in prayer. Also,
[31:53] July the 18th through the 20th. I'm
[31:55] gonna keep repeating this because we are
[31:58] um we got a lot of people signed up, but
[32:00] we need uh to know if you've already got
[32:04] a room or we need to get you a room.
[32:05] We've got like 11 or so rooms available.
[32:09] Um just see
[32:11] me or see Sister June and we will try to
[32:16] help you get uh help you get uh get a
[32:19] place to stay. It'll be a wonderful
[32:21] weekend. For those of you that's never
[32:22] been, it's a wonderful time. And for
[32:24] those you've been, you know, it's a
[32:25] wonderful time. Uh bring two churches
[32:27] together and and fellowship and people
[32:30] we hadn't seen since we were kids. And
[32:33] uh we've had the fellowship now. This
[32:34] will be three three years in a row. So
[32:36] we sure do appreciate the Lord for
[32:39] helping us do that.
[32:41] Also, if you look around, we're kind of
[32:44] getting a little
[32:45] full.
[32:47] Um not so much up here.
[32:51] If you'll look at the end of your seat
[32:52] back there, the first three, the last
[32:54] three
[32:55] rows should be
[32:58] for children. If you have a child six or
[33:01] younger, that's where you need to sit
[33:05] because that's where you can go out with
[33:07] your child. If you're older than six,
[33:10] you need to be up here. Okay? Is
[33:12] everybody with me? Amen. Yeah. Say amen.
[33:16] Okay. Okay. So, the deacons, I instruct
[33:17] y'all to make sure that those first
[33:19] three row, you see it, they're on the
[33:20] end of the you see them written on the
[33:21] end of the seats. Now, T's back there
[33:24] because he's a deacon, but now they've
[33:26] got a full row. But if you're not, if
[33:29] you're don't have children that are
[33:31] below 6 years old, you need to find you
[33:34] a place up here to sit. Some have
[33:36] already migrated up here because their
[33:38] children have gotten older. But, we're
[33:40] missing about 12 people right now. So,
[33:43] put them 12 in here and we're in
[33:44] trouble. So come up and set up here
[33:46] though. Sister Sister
[33:49] uh that's Esther Smallwood right there.
[33:52] Sister Smallwood. She didn't she's fine.
[33:53] She You can sit beside her. And then
[33:56] over there, sister uh uh there's nobody
[33:59] sitting with Joyce and Danny. They must
[34:00] be I don't
[34:02] know. Just saying. But I mean, but but
[34:06] row seven through 14's like
[34:08] this, you know. But from now on, all the
[34:12] back rows, the the three back rows in
[34:14] the back on both
[34:17] sides for children six and under, the
[34:19] family can sit there. All right. The
[34:22] rest of you need to find you a place up
[34:23] here somewhere. Now, if somebody comes
[34:25] in late
[34:27] um and your seat's
[34:29] taken, I'm sorry. Come in
[34:32] early. That's a way to get that's a way
[34:34] to get rid of all that. Just come in
[34:36] earlier than the next guy or or person.
[34:38] So also and this has come about from
[34:42] when we went to the Methodist church and
[34:44] and spoke to them a couple of Sundays
[34:49] ago. No no offense to the people. That's
[34:52] all they know. But as brother uh Bob was
[34:55] talking about and I I I agree 100% when
[34:57] brother Ram said they're nothing but a
[34:59] lodge. That's all they are. It's just a
[35:00] gathering of people. It's just on
[35:02] Sunday. They have nothing else to do
[35:03] unless they do have something else to
[35:05] do. But I mean, they were eating donuts
[35:07] and drinking in the
[35:09] sanctuary. Now, I know we've got kids
[35:11] and like I said, the six and six and
[35:14] below, but if you're over 6 years old,
[35:16] you don't need to be drinking in this
[35:18] sanctuary. There is zero reason unless
[35:21] you if you're sick, go out the door.
[35:24] We're not going to start that where
[35:25] people walk in here with their coffee
[35:26] cups and and water jugs and all that
[35:29] stuff. That ain't going to happen. Not
[35:30] in this church. Okay, everybody with me?
[35:33] Now, this is a house of God. It's not a
[35:36] lodge. If they want to make it a lodge,
[35:38] they can make it a lodge. But this is a
[35:41] place to where the Holy Spirit is so
[35:43] timid. Brother Brown said, "A kid
[35:44] running through the through the hallway
[35:47] here would hinder the next service."
[35:50] Now, you say, "Well, I believe, Brother
[35:51] Brown, I'm all but that." Well, sorry.
[35:53] You're in bad trouble. I just believe he
[35:55] was a prophet, and I believe he came
[35:57] here to set things in order. And when
[35:59] we're set in order, when everything was
[36:01] set in order, even in the Old Testament,
[36:04] God came. When everything was in order,
[36:07] God came. So when we get everything in
[36:09] order, God's going to come and visit us.
[36:11] I just believe that. Also, Communion
[36:13] Footwashing will be after the service.
[36:15] Uh and let's pray for brother, good to
[36:18] have brother Manuel them um uh residing
[36:20] with us now. He's going to be speaking
[36:22] for us May the 7th. Okay.
[36:26] I don't know who's going to if he want
[36:27] interpret himself. I don't know what's
[36:28] going to happen, but but uh I asked him
[36:32] and he said he would. So the the
[36:34] Wednesday, May the I think it's May the
[36:35] 7th, he'll be speaking for us. So uh
[36:37] it's good to have these ones here that
[36:39] are new. We sure appreciate you. Thank
[36:42] you. We appreciate you uh you know
[36:44] pitching in and helping. And uh
[36:47] remember, we're not an organization.
[36:49] We're an organism.
[36:51] And an organism works together. and all
[36:54] the pieces and parts work together.
[36:57] We often hear the quote, "Life is short.
[37:00] Better enjoy it." I'm here to tell you,
[37:03] eternity is long. You better prepare for
[37:05] it. Amen.
[37:09] You better prepare for it. You've heard
[37:11] that. Oh, life is short. You know what?
[37:14] If you prepare yourself for the next
[37:15] life, it's an eternity.
[37:18] If not, you're just going to fade away
[37:20] and end. What a horrible, horrible way
[37:23] to be somewhere without God. I was
[37:26] without God one time and so were you.
[37:28] You were really lonely. Oh yeah, the
[37:31] devil was right there with you. But
[37:32] he'll do nothing but kill, maim,
[37:34] destroy. He's not eternal. Nothing he
[37:37] has is eternal. Nothing this world that
[37:40] you see right now is eternal except that
[37:42] God is inside of each and every one of
[37:44] us. That's it. That's all there is. All
[37:46] right. So, let's just keep that in
[37:48] prayer. Dear heavenly father, thank you
[37:50] for the day that you give us. Forgive us
[37:52] of our sins and our many faults. Lord,
[37:54] may we settle down today, Lord, and and
[37:56] speak to the people as you spoke to me,
[37:58] Lord, yesterday about what to say, Lord.
[38:00] I appre I appreciate you, Lord, showing
[38:04] the things that we need to see, Father,
[38:05] because we're needy people. We need you
[38:08] more than anything, Father. We don't
[38:10] need the world. We don't need anything
[38:12] else except you, Father. And Lord, I
[38:14] pray that you'd bless each one here
[38:16] today. Bless the ones that are sick,
[38:18] that are not here. Lord, bless the ones
[38:19] that are traveling, are going to be
[38:21] traveling. Lord, I pray that you'd be
[38:22] with them. Father, just bless us now.
[38:24] Continue the service in Jesus name.
[38:26] Amen. Today, we're going to speak
[38:28] continue on adoption, but we're going to
[38:30] back up just for a second. Let's read
[38:31] Hebrews 5. And you be seated. Though he
[38:33] were a son, now who's that? He Jesus
[38:35] Christ. Though he were a son, yet
[38:38] learned he obedience by the things which
[38:40] he suffered. And being made perfect. Now
[38:43] remember, Jesus Christ was perfect in
[38:46] spirit and soul cuz he was God. But his
[38:52] body was made. It had a beginning.
[38:57] It had an end and then it was changed.
[39:00] Because it was ch. But why was it
[39:01] changed? It was changed, brother John,
[39:03] by what was inside of him.
[39:06] Okay? So now God is doing the same
[39:08] thing. He's come down to human flesh in
[39:09] our human flesh to change our body. Yes,
[39:12] sir. So, though he were a son, yet he
[39:14] learned obedience by the things he
[39:16] suffered. You can be seated. The Lord
[39:17] had his blessing through reading his
[39:19] word. Second Timothy, we read this last
[39:21] week. Remember that Jesus Christ of the
[39:24] seed of David was raised from the dead
[39:26] according to my
[39:27] gospel. Wherein I suffer
[39:30] trouble. If you're a Christian today, do
[39:33] not say, "I'll never have any trouble."
[39:36] You will have trouble from the time you
[39:39] get that out of your mouth. Everybody
[39:41] with me?
[39:46] Wherein I suffer, it's kind of getting a
[39:47] little easy back there in the back.
[39:49] Wherein I suffer trouble as an evildoer.
[39:51] Now
[39:52] watch. Even unto bonds, most of Paul's
[39:56] writings, what we read as scripture is
[39:59] what? He wrote it from in prison. He was
[40:02] in a prison house, dark, dingy. Told him
[40:06] to bring him a code. He was cold. told
[40:08] him to bring him paper so he could
[40:09] write. He was not sitting in his house
[40:12] like we are with our books and tapes
[40:15] around us and with our uh you know with
[40:17] our LED lights and our heat and air. He
[40:20] wrote the Bible in bonds.
[40:23] Amen. In chains. He wrote the Bible. But
[40:26] the word of God is not bound. Therefore,
[40:30] I endure all things for the elect's
[40:32] sake. He gave his life so that we could
[40:35] have this that they may also obtain the
[40:37] salvation which is in Christ Jesus with
[40:40] eternal glory. Not just temporary
[40:43] eternal glory. It is a faithful saying.
[40:46] For if we be dead with him, we shall
[40:48] also live with him. Amen. If we suffer,
[40:51] we shall also reign with him. If we deny
[40:54] him, he also will deny us. If we believe
[40:58] not, yet he abideth faithful.
[41:01] He cannot deny himself.
[41:04] He can't deny what he said. He can't
[41:06] stop one day and say, "I didn't I don't
[41:08] want to do this anymore. I'm going in
[41:10] this direction." Like most of us, we try
[41:13] a lot of things in this direction right
[41:14] here. And when it does not come to pass,
[41:16] what do we do? We turn and try something
[41:19] else. God's not trying something else.
[41:22] He's already seen, as we're going to see
[41:23] maybe when we get if we get to it, that
[41:25] before the foundation of the world, he
[41:27] knew what you would do. He knew what
[41:29] every person would do on the face of
[41:31] this earth. That's my God. He's
[41:32] unlimited. He is not limited to any one
[41:35] thing. The only thing he's limited to is
[41:37] his word. He can't go outside of his
[41:40] word.
[41:43] Listen, this is a very familiar quote,
[41:45] but I'm going to read again. Now,
[41:47] Brother Brown's preaching in the church,
[41:49] well, this is in the church age book.
[41:50] And if children and hes of God and joint
[41:52] hes with Christ, if so be that we suffer
[41:55] with him, that may we also may be what?
[41:57] glorified together. For I reckon that
[42:00] the sufferings of this present time are
[42:02] not worthy to be compared with the glory
[42:04] which shall be what? Not revealed in him
[42:06] revealed in us. Amen. Unless we suffer
[42:09] with him, we cannot reign with him. You
[42:12] have to suffer to reign. The reason for
[42:14] this is that character simply is never
[42:17] made without suffering.
[42:19] Character is a victory, not a gift.
[42:22] A man without character can't reign
[42:25] because power apart from character is
[42:27] satanic. And remember, we're going to
[42:29] start into the adoption series here uh
[42:31] today. And and we're going to see where
[42:33] that adoption come. Where adoption is,
[42:35] there's authority.
[42:37] All right? There's authority. You can't
[42:39] give your child a set of car keys and
[42:43] they drive you home. It would be a
[42:45] disaster.
[42:47] Even some that maybe have a car could be
[42:50] a disaster. But not with God. He wants
[42:53] to mold our character into his image.
[42:55] Not somebody else's, but into his image.
[42:57] Cuz we come from him as his children.
[43:01] All right. A man without character can't
[43:04] reign because power apart from character
[43:06] is satanic. But power with character is
[43:09] fit to rule. We see many times you look
[43:10] at people like Adolf Hitler and
[43:12] different ones that they were anointed.
[43:14] Amen. Right? But they used their own
[43:16] power without the character of God and
[43:19] it became satanic. And you see what
[43:21] happened? They tried to destroy the
[43:24] whole world. Yes. And since he wants us
[43:27] to share even his throne on the same
[43:28] basis that he overcome. Now listen,
[43:31] Jesus had to overcome.
[43:34] Remember, brother Ram tells us and I
[43:35] agree
[43:36] 100%. Jesus didn't fight it out on the
[43:40] cross. He fought it out in Gethsemane.
[43:43] That's right. Amen. That's where the
[43:45] fight was. Why? It was between him and
[43:47] him.
[43:49] It was It was between you and you when
[43:52] you fight it out. It's between you and
[43:53] you. Of course, we get help and we get
[43:56] things that we, you know, people can
[43:57] talk to us and and and try to help us
[43:59] along, but it comes down to you. You
[44:02] live with you more than anybody else
[44:04] does. So, yes, you if you're if you have
[44:06] a problem, start with you.
[44:10] That's where I start. I start with me.
[44:11] Right?
[44:13] He has overcome and sat down his
[44:15] father's throne. Then we have to
[44:16] overcome to sit with him. And the little
[44:19] temporary sufferings we go through now
[44:21] is not worthy to be compared to the
[44:23] tremendous glory that be revealed in us.
[44:26] Now watch
[44:28] I the whole week back a couple weeks ago
[44:32] you sometimes you
[44:34] wonder God why did you send us a
[44:37] prophet? Why did you send it to me? Why
[44:39] did you send it to me? Why did you send
[44:40] us a prophet? Why'd you send us a
[44:42] spokesperson? Cuz the book of Amos says
[44:44] he's not going to tell you anything
[44:45] unless he tells you through a prophet.
[44:47] Okay, that all right. That's Bible. All
[44:50] right. So, there's got to be a prophet
[44:51] to tell us or what? Are we either going
[44:53] to be Baptist or we're going to be
[44:55] Methodist? We're going to sprinkle.
[44:56] We're going to baptize. We're going to
[44:57] believe in two gods, three gods. We're
[44:59] going to believe in this. We're going to
[45:00] believe in that. It's scattered all over
[45:02] the world. But there's got to be when
[45:05] Jesus was on earth, he was right. Yes.
[45:10] Amen. Amen. He did everything right. He
[45:13] was perfect. He preached perfect. Never
[45:16] had to back up on his notes.
[45:20] Never had to back up on his word either.
[45:22] Amen. And if that same man that's
[45:24] walking the walked the shores of Galilee
[45:26] is inside of each and every one of us
[45:28] today, can't we say the same thing? If
[45:31] we'll give oursel to him and not have
[45:33] our own will involved, when we have our
[45:36] own will involved, we might question and
[45:38] see him as three. We might question and
[45:41] see whether God sent a prophet. That's
[45:43] for you to figure out. Right. It is.
[45:49] And it's not for you to figure out.
[45:52] It's there.
[45:55] Right. That's right, brother D. You when
[45:57] you don't believe something, remember
[45:59] right then at that moment, you become an
[46:00] unbeliever.
[46:03] If it's of God, you become an unbeliever
[46:06] right then. When you say, "I don't
[46:07] believe that." Well, that means you're
[46:08] an unbeliever.
[46:10] But remember, we believe to see. Yes. We
[46:13] don't see. I mean, we don't see and then
[46:15] say, "Oh, I believe that." No, we we
[46:18] believe something that you prove to me
[46:20] Jesus was even on the earth. Prove to
[46:22] me. Show me a picture. Give me a video.
[46:28] Prove it. Prove he
[46:30] died. Prove he resurrected.
[46:34] I can prove all those things. Amen. But
[46:36] it's by faith that I prove them. The
[46:38] faith of Abraham, the faith that we're
[46:40] supposed to have will lead us and guide
[46:42] us into all truth. If you've got the
[46:43] truth inside of you, if you're looking
[46:46] for error, you'll find it.
[46:49] Amen. But if you look for the truth,
[46:51] it'll be right there, too.
[46:54] So, it won't be worthy to compare with
[46:55] the tremendous glory that will be
[46:57] revealed in us. As I said
[46:59] before, God sent us a prophet. And we'll
[47:01] get into when we get into the seals,
[47:04] we're going to see
[47:05] that everything that God did, listen to
[47:08] me one for one minute, everything God
[47:10] did through that prophet was to prove
[47:13] that he's going to do it through a
[47:15] bride. Amen. Amen. Not
[47:19] Eleazar, not Moses. Come on.
[47:25] He's going to do it by the Holy Ghost
[47:26] himself
[47:28] through a prophet where we see the voice
[47:31] was the final voice to the final age
[47:33] because there's no other. What other
[47:34] voice is there? When the seal's open,
[47:37] folks, that's it, right? Amen. Amen. So,
[47:40] brother Brandham's
[47:42] whole coming of earth, if you want to
[47:45] say his coming here was to show us
[47:47] what's already been said in the Bible.
[47:51] But it points it says, "Okay, this is
[47:53] for this group of people." Yes, sir.
[47:56] Right. Cuz remember, he called them all
[47:59] those different things. And then one
[48:00] day, right, at the seals, he said, "Now
[48:02] I call you bride." Why? He knew where
[48:04] that was coming from. So it remember
[48:06] though, he saw a furthest virgin,
[48:08] foolish virgin. He saw a cup of water in
[48:10] my name. He saw these people that were
[48:12] good people. Oh yeah. Right.
[48:16] Unbelievers, make believers, true
[48:17] believers. He saw that. God showed that
[48:19] to him. So if you're an unbeliever, you
[48:23] can't be a believer. That's right. Okay.
[48:25] If you're a foolish virgin, you can't be
[48:27] bride.
[48:29] So, Brother Ram came to separate that.
[48:31] What? D rightly divide the word of
[48:34] truth. Yes. Right. Cuz everybody thinks
[48:37] they're bride.
[48:39] Oh, yeah. Well, Catholics even, you
[48:41] know, all of them, we're we're the bride
[48:43] of Jesus Christ. But do they act like
[48:44] it? Right. Right. You got to have the
[48:47] character of a bride that he set forth
[48:49] in the Bible.
[48:51] Right. Swank talks about vows and
[48:54] marriage and all these different things
[48:55] because it's a total perfect type of
[48:58] Jesus Christ. And then you come up to
[49:00] Paul and he breaks it all down and he
[49:02] says sisters do this, men do, brothers
[49:05] do this. This is what you need to do.
[49:07] Listen, brother Brandham didn't come to
[49:09] make us women wear dresses.
[49:12] That's been in the Bible the whole time.
[49:13] Amen. Amen. For us to have short hair.
[49:16] That's in the Bible the whole time.
[49:19] That's right. It what had been done
[49:21] though, it had been covered up by man's
[49:23] ideas.
[49:24] Amen. It had come from denominational
[49:27] ideas.
[49:31] I was listening to brother Donnie Reagan
[49:32] this morning. He made a real good point.
[49:35] He said, you know, Adam didn't have a
[49:36] belly button.
[49:38] Right? Adam didn't have a belly button.
[49:40] Right. Everybody with me? Are you with
[49:42] me?
[49:44] But now Jesus did
[49:46] because he had to be connected to the to
[49:48] this earth. He had to be our brother.
[49:50] Everybody with me? Are you with me? So
[49:54] what's happening now is that as the
[49:57] bride of Jesus Christ, you don't have a
[49:59] belly button spiritually. You don't have
[50:02] you're not connected to anything. You're
[50:04] a spoken seed word of God. Amen. Amen.
[50:08] If you're still connected to your
[50:10] mother, some of y'all, if you're still
[50:13] connected to your mother, then you're
[50:15] getting a nourishment from your mother.
[50:18] We have a heavenly father. Yes, sir.
[50:21] That spiritual connection. That's why
[50:23] brother Brown stood one day. He said, "I
[50:24] know now I'm not the son of Charles and
[50:26] Ella Brandham." What? He had figured out
[50:30] that where he came from didn't have a
[50:32] belly button. He wasn't connected to
[50:34] that denominational system that the
[50:36] people connect to cuz that's where they
[50:38] get their nourishment. But you and I
[50:40] being the bride of Jesus Christ, we have
[50:42] no connection to that. Amen. Amen. None.
[50:44] Zero. Amen. Right. We don't live by
[50:48] that. We don't get nourishment from
[50:50] mother church.
[50:52] Now, the Bible tells us the word is the
[50:55] mother of us all. New Jerusalem, which
[50:58] is the word of God coming down heaven.
[50:59] Now, that's where we get our
[51:00] nourishment. Yes, sir. Right.
[51:03] But it's not by sexual birth. It's by
[51:06] spiritual birth. Amen. That we're
[51:08] connected to him by soul, not by body.
[51:11] Hallelujah.
[51:14] All right. We'll get into that a little
[51:16] bit more. I've been thinking about a few
[51:17] things, but now we're going to run
[51:19] through this real quick because we're
[51:20] still on the three poles. What is the
[51:22] three poles? It's a force drawing
[51:24] someone or something in a particular
[51:25] direction or course of action. Sorry,
[51:28] brother.
[51:30] I slow down a little bit. So, the first
[51:33] thing I could pull was the prayer line,
[51:34] temporary healing. Millions gathered
[51:35] around Brother Brandham. Listen,
[51:37] millions gathered around Jesus. He fed
[51:39] 5,000. He healed their sick. He raised
[51:42] their dead. But when he stood one day
[51:45] and said, "Today, I know who my father
[51:47] is and I know who yours is." Amen.
[51:50] There's where the separation come.
[51:54] So then millions left
[51:55] him. How many people were there when he
[51:58] died? Oh yeah, there were a few people
[51:59] around, but when he died, they all left.
[52:02] He hung by himself.
[52:05] Even the great Peter and the different
[52:06] ones that said, "Lord, I'll never deny
[52:08] you." Oh my. He denied him three times
[52:10] before he before he died. Absolutely. So
[52:14] the third pull ministers ministries of
[52:18] the word sealed since Jesus Christ. So
[52:19] that's what it is. Jesus stood on the
[52:21] earth. He was all the seals. He was the
[52:23] whole headstone of the church. He was
[52:25] the one that where we get our
[52:27] nourishment from. Right? Every bit of it
[52:30] come from him because he's the head. But
[52:32] remember that head was rejected.
[52:35] The head word was rejected.
[52:40] All right. They took pieces. They took
[52:42] parts.
[52:44] But the head word, that son of man
[52:46] ministry that was, like I said, it was
[52:47] perfect, right? It had no flaws. It
[52:50] didn't say you can have polygamy. It
[52:51] didn't say you could go over here and
[52:52] the, you know, the third pull is this
[52:54] and the seventh seal is this and this is
[52:55] this and this and this. No, he didn't.
[52:57] No.
[52:59] Man said that.
[53:02] Right.
[53:04] So the third pull of his ministry of
[53:05] brother Random, what did he bring? He
[53:07] brought the same thing. He finally
[53:09] started separating right from the
[53:12] denominations, preaching really hard
[53:14] against them because he saw what the
[53:15] Pentecostal spirit was and where it was
[53:17] coming from. Yeah. Amen. So millions
[53:21] left Brother Adam. He preached to just a
[53:23] few group of people in a church in a in
[53:25] a trailer one time.
[53:28] Same way with me and you. That's what's
[53:30] going to happen to us. There is going to
[53:31] be a separating time. Right? Cuz if
[53:34] we're to be to rain, we're supposed to
[53:36] suffer then or you're not suffering
[53:38] right now. I promise you.
[53:41] Okay.
[53:43] And I don't want to be a bear of bad
[53:44] news, but if it will get me out of here,
[53:51] right? Can you say that? Can you say,
[53:54] "God, whatever it
[53:56] takes to put me in that eternal body
[54:00] that you promised me, I know I'm bride.
[54:04] I know I've come to the final voice of
[54:06] the final age. I know there's no other
[54:07] message but this."
[54:10] Come on. Amen. Amen. Or are we so tied
[54:12] to the world where we said, "No, no, no.
[54:14] We got to wait. Mama don't go, won't
[54:18] hinder me. Daddy don't go, won't hinder
[54:22] me." Sure, we won't take them all in.
[54:23] But you know what? There's an individual
[54:25] affair with God. Absolutely. This whole
[54:27] thing, even this adoption that we're
[54:28] coming to talk about, we see that Jesus
[54:31] went upon Mount Transfiguration. He had
[54:33] three people with him, right? Peter,
[54:36] James, and John. They got all excited
[54:39] and different things, you know, and they
[54:40] said, "But when everything was over
[54:42] with, it was Jesus standing there."
[54:44] That's right. Remember when they opened
[54:45] their eyes, they saw Jesus only. When I
[54:47] was one time there was Elijah and there
[54:49] was Moses, different ones there, you
[54:51] know, but they was talking about his
[54:52] other coming to Israel, not our coming.
[54:55] Everybody with me? That's why he said
[54:57] the son of man will be risen again from
[54:59] the dead. That's how plain that is. We
[55:02] know that he was. If you can't read the
[55:04] Bible and know that the confusion that
[55:08] this world is in because of their
[55:11] thoughts and
[55:12] ideas, I watched a congressional hearing
[55:14] the other day where a girl, I think she
[55:18] might have been a guy, but a girl, but
[55:20] she's trying to prove
[55:23] that sex is two, male, female, right?
[55:27] But there's many genders involved in all
[55:29] that.
[55:31] Congress and them senators when some of
[55:33] them are not agreeing with it but some
[55:35] of them are like well you know you can
[55:37] you can be do you see how try that 30
[55:40] years ago try that 40 years ago right
[55:44] that's why it's all so eroded and so and
[55:47] it's in Congress
[55:50] right
[55:51] y'all know that our former
[55:55] administration he is health and human
[55:58] services person.
[56:02] No, it ain't he. It's a she now. Well, I
[56:05] said before he was an ugly man. He's a
[56:07] real ugly
[56:09] woman. But that ran Listen, you we can
[56:12] laugh, but Planned Parenthood and all
[56:14] those things that was connected into
[56:16] that mindset of that woman that used to
[56:18] be a man, that's how it run this whole
[56:20] country. That's why it's garbage. It's
[56:23] all garbage. Every bit of garbage. If
[56:25] you put your
[56:28] I know some of you have 401ks and stock
[56:31] market. That's fine. You should do that.
[56:33] But it took a beating a couple weeks
[56:34] ago, didn't it not? That's what I
[56:36] thought. So, don't ever depend on that
[56:39] to be your way out.
[56:41] Everybody with me? Cuz within one week,
[56:44] one strike of a pin, your your
[56:47] retirement vaporizes. Right. Right. So,
[56:51] who do we So, who who who do we depend
[56:54] on then to not vaporize when he gets
[56:59] That's what he's always wanted. He wants
[57:00] our dependency on him.
[57:03] Not our dependency on us. How I can
[57:07] figure this out, figure it out. God's
[57:10] already got it figured out. The only
[57:12] thing we got to do is plug into it
[57:15] and start receiving the word of God the
[57:18] way it was supposed to be. Listen, you
[57:20] and I are sitting under a ministry the
[57:22] way the word was supposed to be
[57:24] preached. Amen.
[57:26] The way it's supposed to been preached
[57:28] when Jesus was here, listen, he's
[57:30] sitting here today.
[57:33] And all of you saying, "Amen." Why? Cuz
[57:35] it's the word of God. It's what he
[57:38] spoke. It's not what the devil spoke.
[57:40] It's what he spoke.
[57:43] That's why I believe God had to send us
[57:44] a prophet to clear out all the junk.
[57:46] That's right. As I said before, it's
[57:48] Zerubable.
[57:50] He cleared that foundation off and
[57:52] started building again. Cuz it was built
[57:55] wrong. Amen.
[57:57] You can't build God's word on a
[57:59] denomination. No, sir. That's right.
[58:02] So, we got to come though when we look
[58:04] at the at the first poll, second pull,
[58:06] third pull, we've got to come to a place
[58:09] to where we are going to have to be
[58:11] placed or adopted. So we'll get into
[58:14] that here in just a
[58:17] minute. So now we know, brother Brown
[58:20] says the end of the second pull. Third
[58:22] pull's at hand. So we are now under the
[58:25] third pull anointing. If it's if that's
[58:27] not if that's not common to you, then
[58:30] I'm sorry, but just pray that God will
[58:34] help you. Amen. Right. I want I want to
[58:37] read this cuz this is
[58:39] something that I found looking for the
[58:42] other things. Now watch what brother
[58:44] Brown said because we're you and I now
[58:46] are not under a Moses commission.
[58:50] Everybody with me? We're not under a
[58:52] Moses commission. We had a Moses. Moses
[58:55] thy servant is dead. We now are under a
[58:58] Joshua commission. Cuz if you're born
[59:01] again today, you're out of that Moses
[59:03] commission and you're cuz remember Moses
[59:06] was the law, right? Dos and don'ts.
[59:09] Joshua represented grace. But then after
[59:13] you come across that muddy Jordan River,
[59:16] you're not just going to stand there on
[59:17] the banks for the rest of your life.
[59:19] Israel didn't stand there on the banks
[59:21] for the rest of their life. No. Joshua,
[59:24] through the inspiration of the Holy
[59:25] Spirit says, "Okay, Ephraim, you go
[59:26] here. Manasse, you go here. You got
[59:29] this. Every name had a symbol. Amen.
[59:32] Every name had a place.
[59:35] Amen. So listen. So we are now under a
[59:39] Joshua commission because the Joshua
[59:41] commission is placing right and to
[59:45] Joshua the new commander of the army
[59:46] after Moses had passed on seeing that
[59:49] God stayed with him in his
[59:52] mistakes. Everybody with me. This was a
[59:54] this was I never heard brother Ram say
[59:56] this before.
[59:59] Seeing that God stayed with him, who?
[1:00:01] Moses. Y'all remember Moses killed a
[1:00:04] guy, killed a person, right? Okay. Okay.
[1:00:07] Seeing that God stayed with him in his
[1:00:09] mistakes, he held his commission up. No
[1:00:12] matter what Moses done, it was Moses's
[1:00:16] office that God respected. That's right.
[1:00:19] All these people, they want to talk
[1:00:21] about brother around this and he was
[1:00:22] wrong. I don't care. His commission was
[1:00:25] to bring a bride to maturity. Yes, sir.
[1:00:28] That was it. Not that he was squeaky
[1:00:30] clean. None of us are. No.
[1:00:34] But watch what God I want to I want to
[1:00:36] be what God respects, not what man
[1:00:38] respects. Absolutely.
[1:00:41] He was a
[1:00:42] prophet. He was above all the prophets.
[1:00:45] He was really more than any prophet they
[1:00:49] had. Remember when his own sister
[1:00:51] laughed at him for marrying an Ethiopian
[1:00:53] girl? He called them together and said,
[1:00:55] "Don't you fear God? There be one among
[1:00:57] you that's spiritual or prophet. I will
[1:00:59] speak to him in visions and make myself
[1:01:01] known to him in dreams." But it's not so
[1:01:05] with Moses. I speak lip to ear with him.
[1:01:10] Amen. Don't you fear God?
[1:01:13] See, that's not a good thing to
[1:01:15] upon God's people.
[1:01:17] Right. Right. You hurt him when you do
[1:01:21] so. Amen. God had commissioned Moses.
[1:01:25] His failures meant nothing. Amen. Amen.
[1:01:31] I knew that. I don't look at people's
[1:01:33] faults and failures. Why you look at
[1:01:35] that?
[1:01:36] If you want to find something wrong,
[1:01:38] you'll find something. Amen. That's
[1:01:40] right. His failures meant nothing. God
[1:01:44] knowed his heart.
[1:01:47] And he one time Moses complained about
[1:01:49] having too much to do. So God, what did
[1:01:51] he do? He took his spirit and divided it
[1:01:54] among 70. They had no more spirit than
[1:01:56] they had at the beginning. Only thing
[1:01:58] they had, they just had more machinery.
[1:02:00] Same amount of spirit. I like the way
[1:02:02] you put that. God could put his entire
[1:02:05] spirit upon a man if he wants to. Or he
[1:02:08] can scatter it amongst thousands if he
[1:02:10] wants to.
[1:02:12] prophets, apostles, pastors, teachers,
[1:02:14] evangelists. Amen. That's me. That's my
[1:02:17] quote. One day he put his whole spirit
[1:02:19] upon a man called Jesus. Now he
[1:02:22] scattered it through his churches
[1:02:24] everywhere. God keeps his commission.
[1:02:30] You look at all the
[1:02:32] flaws. What was wrong with there was a
[1:02:35] commission that that Samson had to kill
[1:02:38] the Philistines. That's right. But he
[1:02:41] let a woman take him down. But remember,
[1:02:44] at the end, he killed more than he ever
[1:02:46] did the whole life. So he didn't fail.
[1:02:49] Look at David, this great warrior, this
[1:02:51] mighty man that God is going to be the
[1:02:53] son of David to sit on the throne and
[1:02:56] rule and reign over for a thousand
[1:02:58] years, rule
[1:02:59] the country of Israel or the 12 tribes.
[1:03:04] He murdered his best friend. Best friend
[1:03:08] and took his wife. Yes.
[1:03:11] Wow. A murderer, a
[1:03:14] liar, an
[1:03:18] adulterer. Do we look at that? We see
[1:03:22] that. But we see that the nourishment
[1:03:25] that we get from what David wrote is
[1:03:28] more than anything. I mean, the book of
[1:03:29] Psalms, you read Psalms and if it don't
[1:03:32] calm you down, that's why you read the
[1:03:34] book of Psalms. Find you something and
[1:03:36] just read it. I know David sometimes in
[1:03:38] there he has torment because what he's
[1:03:40] torn between two
[1:03:43] but there's times in there which says oh
[1:03:46] as the deer
[1:03:47] panth by the waterbrook so my soul longs
[1:03:52] after you
[1:03:55] now brother is set an order here and
[1:03:56] then we'll start with adoption here in
[1:03:58] just a second notice the very day when
[1:04:00] this messenger not when he starts on but
[1:04:02] when he begins to declare his message so
[1:04:05] brother Bram's message is in three parts
[1:04:07] hearts. The first pull was
[1:04:09] healing. There's no
[1:04:12] doubt. There's no doubt that there was
[1:04:14] millions healed under his ministry.
[1:04:17] Everybody with me? No doubt. We've heard
[1:04:20] some of them out of their own lips to my
[1:04:22] ear. So that's enough for
[1:04:24] me. All right. So the second pull was
[1:04:27] prophesying. What he started telling
[1:04:29] them the thoughts and intents of their
[1:04:30] heart. The third pull was the opening of
[1:04:32] the word, the mysteries revealed. Now,
[1:04:35] as as Jesus learned by the things he
[1:04:37] suffered, right? That's what the Bible
[1:04:38] says. Amen. He he learned through his
[1:04:41] walk that he that he had to be under
[1:04:43] subjection. He found out at 13 to be
[1:04:45] under subjection to his parents. Amen.
[1:04:48] Hello 13 year olds. If Jesus can do it,
[1:04:51] so can you.
[1:04:53] You too want
[1:04:55] to be subject to your parents, right?
[1:05:00] He walked through life and I would say
[1:05:03] he probably made a few mistakes. I'm
[1:05:06] talking about human mistakes, you know,
[1:05:09] didn't go down the right road. I mean,
[1:05:10] he sure he was led by the he was led by
[1:05:12] the Lord, but they was it says right
[1:05:14] here that being made perfect,
[1:05:17] being made perfect, he was the author of
[1:05:19] our salvation.
[1:05:22] So that's why if you want to find
[1:05:23] something about somebody's life, you're
[1:05:24] going to find it because we're all human
[1:05:26] beings. That's right. But the essence of
[1:05:29] this message is it's not on paper.
[1:05:33] It's not on paper. It's what you have
[1:05:36] inside of you. It's in your heart. Amen.
[1:05:38] Amen.
[1:05:40] The word of faith we
[1:05:42] preach. The letter will kill you. You
[1:05:44] can find Give me a quote. I'll get you
[1:05:46] one that sounds contrary. Right. How
[1:05:50] many of you have eaten Jesus's flesh and
[1:05:51] drink his blood yet?
[1:05:53] Oh, I'm sorry. Jesus told us that.
[1:05:56] personally. It wasn't through a
[1:05:58] five-fold ministry. He told us, "Have
[1:06:00] any ever done that yet?"
[1:06:03] We're going to do it in a few minutes by
[1:06:05] revelation.
[1:06:06] We're going to do that in a few minutes.
[1:06:09] Without revelation, you go carnal every
[1:06:12] single time.
[1:06:14] You will think carnal because there is
[1:06:16] no the carnal mind is an enmity with
[1:06:19] God. Immity is division. Your carnal
[1:06:21] mind cannot mesh with the word of God.
[1:06:24] That's why Paul told us we need to have
[1:06:26] that mind of Christ and not the old man
[1:06:31] Amen. He said the life I now live I live
[1:06:34] by defaith of the son of God. Amen.
[1:06:40] So the mysteries were revealed. So we're
[1:06:42] now we're at the mysteries being
[1:06:43] revealed. We see that a prophet came
[1:06:46] through the whole thing. He came through
[1:06:48] justification, sanctification, baptism
[1:06:50] of the Holy Ghost. He came through the
[1:06:52] three pools. He come to a place to where
[1:06:55] God adopted him.
[1:06:59] But now let's look at this real
[1:07:04] quick cuz this is what we were talking
[1:07:06] about the other
[1:07:07] day cuz remember in the third pull
[1:07:11] there's three things
[1:07:13] happen. Now watch. And then when that
[1:07:16] time comes and the press comes to a
[1:07:19] place to where you're pressed
[1:07:21] out, then watch what I'm fixing to tell
[1:07:23] you in a few minutes. Watch the third
[1:07:25] pull. Then it'll be absolutely to the
[1:07:28] totally lost. Yeah.
[1:07:31] To the bride. Yeah. And the church.
[1:07:37] Totally lost. The door is shut. Who shut
[1:07:40] the door of the ark? God shut the door.
[1:07:43] Amen. Amen. Listen, because he knows
[1:07:47] even when even when we know the door's
[1:07:50] getting ready to shut or it's already
[1:07:52] shut, we're still crying for our people
[1:07:53] that we're not in. We're just That's
[1:07:56] just our connection with them. Everybody
[1:07:57] with me. But there is going to come a
[1:07:59] time, folks. I'm telling you, there will
[1:08:02] be no more salvation on this earth
[1:08:04] except for the Jews. None. You're out.
[1:08:07] You're done. You're drowned. You're
[1:08:08] dead. Yeah, you'll have to come up to
[1:08:10] white throne judgment and and be judged
[1:08:13] by your works. Oh,
[1:08:16] listen. Let me stand behind Jesus and
[1:08:19] let him He's already went to judgment
[1:08:20] for me. Amen. He took on our judgment.
[1:08:24] We don't have to go to the white throne.
[1:08:27] That ought to make you happy. That ought
[1:08:30] to make you shout, "God, thank you for
[1:08:32] that revelation." Cuz I'll guarantee
[1:08:35] you, you go out there, you going to
[1:08:36] denomination. Oh yeah. We got to all
[1:08:39] stand before the white throne cuz I
[1:08:41] ain't perfect and you ain't perfect. And
[1:08:43] we going to have to go through
[1:08:44] tribulation. Believe me, nobody except
[1:08:47] the people I know in this message, they
[1:08:49] believe you got to go through all that.
[1:08:52] You've already passed from death into
[1:08:53] life. You've already passed. You're
[1:08:55] you're living your judgment right now.
[1:08:57] Yes, sir. Amen. You're judging in your
[1:09:01] mind what I'm saying and it's either
[1:09:03] going to help you or you're going to
[1:09:05] kick it out and you're but you know what
[1:09:07] you're going to do? You're going to hear
[1:09:08] it at your day of judgment.
[1:09:11] Amen. Any minister that stands up here
[1:09:14] and ministers the word of God and you
[1:09:16] turn it down, you are not turning that
[1:09:18] person down.
[1:09:20] Amen. You're turning God almighty down.
[1:09:24] Right. You love the Lord. Amen. Amen.
[1:09:27] Boy, I thank him for the things he give
[1:09:28] me. And I couldn't have got it with How
[1:09:31] where you going to go get it at?
[1:09:34] Brother Bob, where you going to get it
[1:09:35] at?
[1:09:38] If you had a billion dollars, where you
[1:09:39] going to go buy it at?
[1:09:42] Huh? Where? Tell me where you can buy
[1:09:44] it. It's free.
[1:09:47] Hallelujah. It's free. Just accept it.
[1:09:50] Glory. Amen. Amen. Amen. All right,
[1:09:53] let's start here just for a few minutes.
[1:09:55] We got about two hours left. So
[1:10:00] adoption. So now what is adoption? Now
[1:10:03] we know the adoption
[1:10:04] is in like now in the time of adoption
[1:10:08] is that if there's a child doesn't have
[1:10:11] parents or child is in foster care, you
[1:10:13] can adopt them into your family.
[1:10:16] Everybody with me? All right. But that's
[1:10:20] not the kind of adoption that God's
[1:10:21] talking about. Because this adoption,
[1:10:23] we'll look at in a few minutes, this
[1:10:25] adoption was way back.
[1:10:28] And when you adopt somebody according to
[1:10:29] the Bible, you adopt somebody that's
[1:10:31] already in your family. Amen. That came
[1:10:34] from the loins of your parents or from
[1:10:37] the loins of God, one of the two.
[1:10:39] Everybody with me? Amen. So the word
[1:10:41] adoption means to set, put, or
[1:10:46] place. Remember Joshua goes across. He
[1:10:48] says, "You go over here, Ephereim. You
[1:10:50] got one of them. You got oil on your
[1:10:52] heel. You over here." There's all kind
[1:10:54] of Listen, that wasn't just God just
[1:10:56] speaking and it ain't going to happen.
[1:10:58] Remember, when God speaks, everything
[1:10:59] happened. Amen.
[1:11:03] To set, fix or establish. See, it would
[1:11:07] hurt. It would help us if we got
[1:11:09] established in this present day truth.
[1:11:12] As Paul said, if you'll establish
[1:11:14] yourself in this present day truth and
[1:11:16] forget all the garbage out in the world,
[1:11:18] then it will be a so much peace. Amen.
[1:11:22] Even though the storm's raging, there'll
[1:11:24] be so much peace. As I was telling them
[1:11:26] in at the Methodist church, I said,
[1:11:29] "Son's always shining."
[1:11:32] We took off one time from Miami and it
[1:11:34] was storming. The plane was almost
[1:11:35] flipped. It wasn't that time. It was
[1:11:37] another time when Aaron was with me
[1:11:40] out of Atlanta. Yeah, exactly. We were
[1:11:43] uh we were bouncing around. If you can
[1:11:45] bounce him up off of a seat, it's pretty
[1:11:48] rough. And Brad Pilow was on this side
[1:11:50] and we got he got to singing, I got to
[1:11:52] praying and Brad got to praying. It was
[1:11:54] pretty rough. But what happens though
[1:11:57] when you fly, it's pouring down rain,
[1:12:00] lightning, and thunder everywhere. And
[1:12:02] you're like, man, this is a bad dreary
[1:12:05] day. You get about 10,000 feet, Brother
[1:12:08] John. You get on the other side of those
[1:12:10] clouds. Come on, somebody. You get on
[1:12:12] the other side of them clouds and it's
[1:12:14] just like a table.
[1:12:16] You got all that garbage going on down
[1:12:18] here, but you're in that airplane and
[1:12:20] you break out. Guess what? You'll meet
[1:12:22] the sun. That's right. The sun is
[1:12:24] shining always in your journey. It
[1:12:27] doesn't matter how bad it is. The sun's
[1:12:29] shining. You just got to what? Get up
[1:12:31] there. Amen. Get up there. Amen. It's
[1:12:35] why we need to come higher. Amen. In
[1:12:38] this agape love to set forth to
[1:12:41] establish or ordain listen to know who
[1:12:44] you are
[1:12:47] amen. Why am I here?
[1:12:50] I can't tell you. God can cause he put
[1:12:54] you here for a purpose. Right. Matthew
[1:12:57] 17 verse5 said while he yet spake behold
[1:13:00] a bright cloud overshadowed them. And
[1:13:02] behold, a voice out of the cloud which
[1:13:04] said, "This is my beloved son in whom I
[1:13:07] am well pleased. Hear ye him." Amen.
[1:13:11] Amen. So in other words, he pointed the
[1:13:13] the direction of the whole world to that
[1:13:16] man called Jesus. Now did they accept
[1:13:20] it? No.
[1:13:22] Did he understand it?
[1:13:24] No. But do we?
[1:13:27] We do.
[1:13:29] We know what happened. Yes. But
[1:13:32] remember, he went on to Calvary.
[1:13:36] He died. Right? So now let's look at
[1:13:39] this our life just for a few
[1:13:42] minutes. Galatians
[1:13:47] 3:22. Now
[1:13:50] watch what scripture is he talking
[1:13:52] about. Now Paul is writing the New
[1:13:53] Testament. So he's referring to what?
[1:13:56] The Old Testament.
[1:13:58] Everybody with me? There's no New
[1:14:00] Testament. Paul's writing it, but he's
[1:14:03] writing it from what happened in the Old
[1:14:05] Testament. Types and shadows. That's
[1:14:07] right. Amen. Right. You know, it was
[1:14:09] wonderful when brother Daniel was
[1:14:10] speaking here. People say, "Well, that
[1:14:12] was for the that was for the old that
[1:14:13] was in the Old Testament." What's the
[1:14:15] first thing? What did Jesus do when he
[1:14:16] met Cleopus and that man going down the
[1:14:18] road?
[1:14:20] He took them back
[1:14:22] to Moses
[1:14:24] and explained to them who he was through
[1:14:27] the Old Testament. The Old Testament.
[1:14:30] Listen, the Old Testament was law, but
[1:14:32] you know what? Through our filter, it's
[1:14:34] got grace. Amen. Amen. Galatians
[1:14:38] 3:22, but the scripture hath concluded
[1:14:42] all under sin. All right. So, let's go
[1:14:45] home. We're done. We We're
[1:14:47] finished. That the promise by faith of
[1:14:53] Jesus Christ might be given to them that
[1:14:57] sometimes believe. Hallelujah. Right.
[1:15:00] No, believe.
[1:15:02] But when I watch, but before faith came,
[1:15:06] we were kept under the law. Right?
[1:15:09] Because remember, the law is what
[1:15:10] condemns you. The law is what kills you.
[1:15:12] The law is what puts you in jail. Right?
[1:15:14] Right. Everybody with me? Amen. Amen.
[1:15:17] Now, what happened? What? Look, shut
[1:15:21] up unto the faith which should be
[1:15:24] afterwards be revealed.
[1:15:27] Okay? Because remember, you can't change
[1:15:29] God God's mind by forn knowledge. You
[1:15:31] always was eternal. Everybody with me?
[1:15:34] Amen. You were a seed of God before the
[1:15:36] foundation of the world. Amen. You just
[1:15:38] came here to what? Develop the picture
[1:15:40] and go through suffering and go through
[1:15:42] trials so that he we can point to the
[1:15:44] devil and say, "Boo."
[1:15:47] Amen. But before faith came, we were
[1:15:50] kept under the
[1:15:51] law. Me and somebody else was talking. I
[1:15:54] think it was yesterday. Any Christian
[1:15:56] that becomes a Christian, brand new
[1:15:58] Christian, it's just all law. Yeah.
[1:16:02] Cuz you don't know what grace is yet.
[1:16:04] But when you come into the faith and you
[1:16:06] start sitting here and it's like that,
[1:16:07] brother Carlos said, he'd sit there and
[1:16:09] he'd watch you people come in 30 minutes
[1:16:11] late for church. He said, "Now, Brother
[1:16:12] Brandham said you need to be here 30
[1:16:14] minutes before." He said, "Till I
[1:16:15] started having children."
[1:16:17] Yeah.
[1:16:19] So anyway,
[1:16:22] shut up unto the faith which should be
[1:16:24] afterwards, which should afterwards be
[1:16:26] revealed. So we're all under the law
[1:16:28] because we were born that way.
[1:16:32] But praise God, there's a way out.
[1:16:37] Wherefore the law was our school master.
[1:16:42] Right. The very law is what taught Paul
[1:16:46] what to say and do. in the new to to
[1:16:49] write the New Testament. Yes, sir.
[1:16:50] Right. That's right. And let me be clear
[1:16:53] on this. Let me be clear to you. Brother
[1:16:56] Brandham got a lot from God.
[1:17:01] But there's a lot he got from previous
[1:17:03] preachers,
[1:17:04] right?
[1:17:06] No eggs. No eggs. They're expensive.
[1:17:08] Don't throw them. Tomatoes, but not
[1:17:10] eggs. He did. He quoted different
[1:17:14] preachers, right? We know he had his own
[1:17:17] message. We know God revealed it, but
[1:17:18] there is bits and pieces that we can all
[1:17:20] use.
[1:17:23] We're for the law was our school master.
[1:17:25] So guess what? You got to go to school.
[1:17:29] School is a requirement.
[1:17:32] Amen. Be with me.
[1:17:35] To bring us unto Christ, you got to have
[1:17:37] a good teacher. Not just a good teacher,
[1:17:41] right? You got to have a good teacher.
[1:17:43] That inside teacher is the Holy Ghost.
[1:17:45] Amen. Amen. Cuz remember now listen,
[1:17:49] Moses brought the law.
[1:17:52] All right.
[1:17:54] Joshua brought grace, right? I'll read
[1:17:58] it to you in a
[1:17:59] minute. Joshua brought grace and a
[1:18:02] placing. But remember, Joshua got what
[1:18:07] he
[1:18:08] had listening to Moses.
[1:18:12] Come on. He was there the whole time.
[1:18:14] Remember, if you'll read your scripture,
[1:18:17] Joshua was up on the mountain with him
[1:18:18] when he went and got the Ten
[1:18:19] Commandments. He didn't go all the way
[1:18:20] up, but he went part of the way.
[1:18:23] Right.
[1:18:25] He was sometimes he would be in the
[1:18:26] temple with Moses, not the Holy of
[1:18:29] Holies, but he'd be in the temple with
[1:18:30] him.
[1:18:32] Right.
[1:18:33] So, he was
[1:18:35] learning by faith. He was learning. He
[1:18:38] put his faith in that law. Right. Right.
[1:18:42] That knowing though that grace was going
[1:18:44] to take over when the law passed. So
[1:18:48] listen,
[1:18:49] watch. That we might be justified, not
[1:18:52] by the law, but justified by faith.
[1:18:57] Now watch. But after that faith is
[1:19:00] come, we are no longer under that school
[1:19:04] master. Amen. That's right. You don't
[1:19:06] have to be reborn again. Praise God.
[1:19:10] You get refillings. You get anointings.
[1:19:11] You get all but you don't have to go
[1:19:13] through and and be born again. Once
[1:19:15] you're born again, that's it. Amen. See,
[1:19:17] if the if the if the Baptist would take
[1:19:19] that eternal security that way, I'll
[1:19:21] believe with them, right? But not just
[1:19:23] that you shake somebody's hand and you
[1:19:24] don't come to church for the next 30
[1:19:26] years and then they going to bury you
[1:19:27] and send you to heaven. That is not
[1:19:29] eternal security. Eternal security is
[1:19:31] you got eternal life inside of you right
[1:19:33] right now. Not at the white throne.
[1:19:35] Right?
[1:19:36] But after that faith is come, we are no
[1:19:38] longer under a school master. For ye are
[1:19:41] all the children of God by faith in
[1:19:43] Christ Jesus. So remember this adoption
[1:19:46] does not pertain to anyone outside of
[1:19:49] your family.
[1:19:52] That's right. Right? Because you're
[1:19:54] realizing what family you're in. Even
[1:19:57] though you may be a child of God, child
[1:19:59] training, you may just now be born
[1:20:01] again,
[1:20:03] but you're still a child of God, right?
[1:20:07] By faith in Jesus Christ. For as many of
[1:20:09] you as have been baptized into Christ,
[1:20:12] have put on Christ.
[1:20:14] There's neither Jew nor Greek, bond or
[1:20:16] free, male or female, but we're all one
[1:20:19] in Christ Jesus. Amen. Now look, and if
[1:20:23] ye be Christ, then are you Abraham's
[1:20:26] seed and hes according to that promise.
[1:20:30] Now what was the promise to
[1:20:32] Abraham? His seed would possess the
[1:20:35] gates of the enemy. And also Abraham,
[1:20:38] wherever the soul of your feet
[1:20:41] hit the earth, that's yours. That's
[1:20:44] right. Anywhere. Abraham didn't just
[1:20:47] Yeah, we sure. Abraham wandered around.
[1:20:50] If you look at the map, he kind of
[1:20:51] walked off. You know why? He was
[1:20:52] possessing because remember footsteps
[1:20:54] mean possession.
[1:20:56] That's why that's why Jesus told us,
[1:20:59] brother Collie, that's why Jesus said,
[1:21:01] "Go into all the world, preach the
[1:21:02] gospel, and when you get finished with
[1:21:04] that, the end will come because we got
[1:21:07] to have bride." I just believe this.
[1:21:09] There got to be bride possess Japan,
[1:21:12] China, Ukraine, Russia, all these
[1:21:15] different places. Why? Cuz you're a son
[1:21:17] and daughter of God. And the world's got
[1:21:19] the world's got to hear this gospel at
[1:21:21] least maybe one time.
[1:21:25] Everybody with me? All right, real quick
[1:21:27] and then we'll close. We won't get
[1:21:29] anywhere today, but we'll get somewhere
[1:21:30] next time. Galatians 4:1. Now, this is a
[1:21:34] continuation. Remember, this is Paul
[1:21:36] continuing his
[1:21:37] letter. Now, I say that the
[1:21:41] heir, as long as he's a child,
[1:21:44] differereth nothing from a servant.
[1:21:46] Amen. though he be Lord of all.
[1:21:52] Jesus didn't come up there at 13 years
[1:21:54] old and we knew that God we know the
[1:21:57] spirit of God was on him and in him and
[1:21:58] he he I'm sure he talked to God and he
[1:22:01] was probably a little bit weird to
[1:22:03] people but when his mom and daddy found
[1:22:05] him and she absolutely messed up.
[1:22:08] Remember what brother Brown said? Said,
[1:22:10] "Your mother and
[1:22:11] I," he still looked at him. And the
[1:22:14] Bible said that from that day forward,
[1:22:16] he was subject to his parents.
[1:22:20] The human part of Jesus was subject to
[1:22:22] his parents.
[1:22:24] That's why you kids can't say, "Well,
[1:22:26] bless God. I'm doing what God said, and
[1:22:29] I'm not going to do what my parents
[1:22:31] said." I hope they combine and come
[1:22:33] together. But there might be a time when
[1:22:34] you need to get a I was fix to say the
[1:22:36] word a rear end
[1:22:40] whipping. And you better cry for Jesus
[1:22:42] before it
[1:22:43] happens. When I got
[1:22:46] whipped
[1:22:47] anyway, if some of the whipping I got
[1:22:50] and you y some of y'all too got when you
[1:22:51] was in school or at home, they'd put the
[1:22:53] people in jail. The jail would be full
[1:22:54] of people, child abusers,
[1:22:58] grief. This whole thing fell apart when
[1:23:01] they took prayer
[1:23:04] and punishment out of school.
[1:23:07] Because though we be an
[1:23:10] air, that's why you and I are not going
[1:23:12] to sit here and leave on a flowery bed
[1:23:13] of ease. Brother Ram told us that we got
[1:23:16] to suffer to reign. What's the suffering
[1:23:18] part? You got to study. You got to do
[1:23:20] the right thing. If you don't do the
[1:23:21] right thing, you'll get the little
[1:23:23] smack. Amen. Now, though he be Lord of
[1:23:27] all, but is under tutors and governors.
[1:23:30] Now, he's moved from a school master.
[1:23:33] All right. He's got into college now
[1:23:36] where the tutors and governors, same
[1:23:39] same teacher, just moved up a little bit
[1:23:42] higher in Revelation.
[1:23:45] Because remember, God is not going to
[1:23:46] adopt a baby,
[1:23:50] right? No, you receive the spirit of
[1:23:52] adoption. We'll read that next week.
[1:23:53] You'll receive the spirit of adoption.
[1:23:55] You don't receive the adoption. You're
[1:23:57] in line for adoption when you are into
[1:23:59] the family of God by the new birth.
[1:24:02] Everybody with me?
[1:24:04] Naturally, if Michael and Benjamin, if
[1:24:07] something happens to mama, I'll promise
[1:24:09] you as love much as I love Sister Mila
[1:24:11] and she loves me, I'm probably not in
[1:24:13] her will.
[1:24:15] Why? I'm not a family member.
[1:24:19] But he get because he's in the family,
[1:24:22] he gets what this one gives. Same way
[1:24:26] with God. That's why by the new birth,
[1:24:27] we get everything God tells us in the
[1:24:30] word of God. Every promise in the book
[1:24:32] is mine. Amen. The will has been read
[1:24:35] every Sunday and you one, you know, when
[1:24:37] you get one of them aha moments when you
[1:24:39] say, "Oh man, I see that." That's God
[1:24:42] telling you what you've got. Amen. He's
[1:24:45] telling you the will today. And what was
[1:24:47] his will? His will was to adopt us,
[1:24:50] change us, and take us home.
[1:24:52] Amen. But he's under tutors and
[1:24:54] governors. Look, until the time
[1:24:56] appointed of the father,
[1:24:58] not of the mother. Come on. Sorry.
[1:25:01] Right. Of the father. Yes. Because the
[1:25:04] father's the head. Christ is the head of
[1:25:05] the church.
[1:25:08] Even so, we when we were children were
[1:25:10] in bondage under the elements of the
[1:25:13] world. Right. But when the fullness of
[1:25:15] the time was come, God sent forth his
[1:25:18] son made of a woman, made under the law.
[1:25:21] Remember Jesus came under the law. You
[1:25:22] know that, right? Right. To redeem them
[1:25:25] that were under the law that we might
[1:25:28] receive the adoption or the placing of
[1:25:32] sons, not make you a son. When you're
[1:25:33] born again, you are a son of God. You
[1:25:36] are a daughter of God. You are eternal
[1:25:38] in your soul. Amen. But God doesn't want
[1:25:42] you to stay 12 years old. Absolutely. He
[1:25:45] wants you to grow up. Because listen
[1:25:47] with, can I say this? Without us coming
[1:25:51] to
[1:25:52] maturity, God can't do anything.
[1:25:56] I'm talking about body change. I'm
[1:25:59] talking about healing.
[1:26:01] Who stops your healing?
[1:26:04] Who stops your adoption?
[1:26:07] Worst enemy I got right here. Right.
[1:26:10] Susan, you didn't have to say that.
[1:26:13] Oh, okay. I thought you talking about
[1:26:14] me.
[1:26:16] But made of a woman. Look, he came same
[1:26:18] way we did. Yes, sir. He came under the
[1:26:21] law. You know why we know that? Cuz I
[1:26:24] read it the other Sunday. He went to the
[1:26:25] temple and was circumcised on the
[1:26:26] seventh day. That's right. Or the eighth
[1:26:29] day. To redeem them that were under the
[1:26:32] law that we might receive the adoption
[1:26:35] of sons. Yes. Romans tells us, as I said
[1:26:38] before, we receive the spirit of God
[1:26:42] which has the adoption in it. Yes. Amen.
[1:26:47] You can choose whether to keep growing
[1:26:49] or you can choose to not. Absolutely.
[1:26:51] But you'll be malnourished. Your life
[1:26:53] will show it. Come on, somebody.
[1:26:56] If you're fighting, what are you
[1:26:58] fighting with?
[1:27:01] Think about that.
[1:27:03] So, let's look at this real quick. And
[1:27:05] then we'll this will be the last thing
[1:27:06] we'll look
[1:27:07] at. That thing I thought about dad all
[1:27:09] day yesterday. He bless his heart he
[1:27:11] never could pronounce that bar
[1:27:15] mitzvah. So now watch what it is. The
[1:27:19] religious intention in in initiation
[1:27:23] ceremony of a Jewish boy who has reached
[1:27:26] the age of 13. Now what? and is regarded
[1:27:29] as ready to observe religious precepts
[1:27:32] and eligible to take part in public
[1:27:36] worship. Right? So the bar mitzvah is
[1:27:39] but now if you're if you're a wild child
[1:27:43] ain't going to
[1:27:45] happen. The word bar means son. Remember
[1:27:48] the Bible says bar Jonas
[1:27:50] son of Jonas bar means son in in in the
[1:27:55] Jewish language. Mitzvah means of
[1:27:58] commandment or promise. So a son, you
[1:28:00] and I are sons,
[1:28:05] but to go to the bar
[1:28:06] mitzvah are to get your adoption
[1:28:11] papers that your name's as good on a
[1:28:13] check as father's is. You have to go to
[1:28:16] the bar mitzvah, right? You have to wear
[1:28:19] certain kind of clothes.
[1:28:22] You got to dress right, act right,
[1:28:25] right?
[1:28:27] Everybody with me? Amen.
[1:28:30] So let's go. Let's look at it one more
[1:28:32] time.
[1:28:35] So we
[1:28:36] take you say a religious ceremony
[1:28:40] initiating ceremony. Ain't that what
[1:28:42] Jesus when Jesus was on Mount Trans
[1:28:44] transfiguration, he had an adoption
[1:28:45] ceremony.
[1:28:47] This is my beloved son and whom I'm well
[1:28:49] to please. Jesus they God said that when
[1:28:52] Jesus was on the river Jordan typing
[1:28:54] your new birth. Everybody with me? He
[1:28:56] didn't need a new birth. But type in
[1:28:58] your new birth. God is pleased to dwell.
[1:29:01] And sometimes that's hard for us to
[1:29:02] believe. But if you got the new birth
[1:29:04] today, God is pleased to dwell in your
[1:29:07] vessel.
[1:29:09] That's right. But he didn't want to stay
[1:29:12] there. But he didn't just come out of
[1:29:14] the water, start his journey in his
[1:29:16] ministry, and two days later, the mount
[1:29:20] transfiguration part came. No.
[1:29:24] It took almost 30 years. Yes. Right.
[1:29:27] That's right. But he came to a point
[1:29:29] where God said, "I'm going to show the
[1:29:31] world. I'm going to show all the people
[1:29:34] that follow me, Peter, James, and John.
[1:29:36] I'm going to show the ones that are with
[1:29:37] me that if you're going to get anything,
[1:29:39] you're going to get it from this man
[1:29:40] right here. You're going to get it from
[1:29:41] Jesus."
[1:29:43] Amen. But remember, six months later, he
[1:29:46] was hanging on a cross after this
[1:29:48] happened at Mount Transfiguration.
[1:29:50] Matthew 17. So, it's not going to be a
[1:29:53] real power of
[1:29:54] bees because remember like I just read
[1:29:58] you
[1:30:00] character is a what? Victory. Right.
[1:30:04] Right. It's a victory over something.
[1:30:08] Yes. When you take a 13-year-old child,
[1:30:11] and this is the type of our of our
[1:30:13] adoption, you take a 13-year-old
[1:30:17] child, that child is watched by tutors
[1:30:19] and governors, watched by the father,
[1:30:23] watched by the family, and then he comes
[1:30:26] to a place to where the father says,
[1:30:29] "He's ready." Amen. He's ready.
[1:30:34] Listen, he's proved himself. Yes, sir.
[1:30:36] Right now, remember, he didn't come up
[1:30:38] to him and hand him his birth
[1:30:39] certificate and say, "You're my son
[1:30:40] now."
[1:30:42] No, we're past that. Remember, your
[1:30:44] adoption is not your birth. Amen. That's
[1:30:47] right. You can be born again and not be
[1:30:49] adopted, but you can't be adopted and
[1:30:51] not be born again.
[1:30:53] So, born again's got to come first. You
[1:30:55] got to make sure you have got yourself
[1:30:57] in the right family. Amen. When you get
[1:31:00] in that right family, then if you start
[1:31:02] acting right, God's going to perform a
[1:31:05] ceremony on you just like he did,
[1:31:06] brother Brandham with a sword in his
[1:31:07] hand and all these things that happened
[1:31:09] that I really don't care what people
[1:31:11] think about it. It happened. So, I
[1:31:14] really don't that don't that
[1:31:16] don't Jeez, if a rocket did that, I want
[1:31:20] to see the rocket that did it. You know,
[1:31:22] that was 20 something miles wide. 20
[1:31:24] something miles. That's from here to
[1:31:26] Commerce,
[1:31:27] right?
[1:31:29] That wasn't just
[1:31:31] a a little jet that flew by, right? An
[1:31:36] atomic bomb can't even hold that
[1:31:38] together. When it goes off, it's just
[1:31:40] chaos. It just goes up and makes a
[1:31:43] mushroom. No, I believe God had a hand
[1:31:45] in that. If you don't, then that's your
[1:31:46] business. You got to figure it out for
[1:31:47] yourself. Amen.
[1:31:51] We'll read this right here. We'll get
[1:31:52] ready to close. Everything ready? Okay.
[1:31:56] Now, the book of Ephesians, as I was
[1:31:58] just saying, to my opinion, is one of
[1:32:01] the greatest books of the New Testament.
[1:32:03] It leaves us, now watch, it leaves us on
[1:32:06] where Calvinism runs out on one limb,
[1:32:08] Armenianism runs out on the other limb.
[1:32:11] Now, what is he talking about?
[1:32:12] Predestination. And we'll get into that
[1:32:14] next Sunday because predestination, you
[1:32:16] got to bring it in because Calvinism is
[1:32:19] like it stamped like God did put you in
[1:32:21] a cube and pull you through. And that's
[1:32:22] the only way it could be, right?
[1:32:25] Armenianism was a little more over the
[1:32:27] greasy
[1:32:29] side. Doesn't matter what you do. But
[1:32:31] the book of Ephesians draws it together
[1:32:34] and positionally places the church. Now,
[1:32:37] I've typed it with Joshua. If you
[1:32:39] notice, Israel was brought up out of
[1:32:41] Egypt. And there's three stages of their
[1:32:44] journey. One stage, they left Egypt. One
[1:32:47] stage, you left the world.
[1:32:50] Right. You made a decision to get up and
[1:32:53] get out of the place you were in and go
[1:32:55] walking. Amen. Right. Out of into Yes,
[1:33:00] sir.
[1:33:02] Three stages. One was leaving Egypt. The
[1:33:05] next was what they even called the
[1:33:07] wilderness. It was the wilderness of
[1:33:09] what? Sin. Right. It was lit. Read your
[1:33:14] Bible. It's called the wilderness of
[1:33:16] sin. That's what you wandered around in.
[1:33:18] That's right.
[1:33:19] Even after you were brought out, there
[1:33:21] was things that kept having to be shaven
[1:33:22] away from you. That's what this is for.
[1:33:26] Amen. You got all you needed for your
[1:33:29] journey, but you had to have a journey.
[1:33:32] Amen. Amen. One stage was leaving Egypt.
[1:33:35] Egypt. The next stage was the
[1:33:37] wilderness. And the next stage was
[1:33:39] Canaan. Listen, by the new birth, you
[1:33:42] are in Canaan land now. Your soul is.
[1:33:46] But God don't want you to just stand at
[1:33:48] the river. He wants to put you where you
[1:33:50] need to be. Now watch. Now Canaan does
[1:33:53] not represent the age of the millennium.
[1:33:55] It only represents the age of the
[1:33:57] overcomer. The dispensation of
[1:34:00] overcoming because in Canaan they killed
[1:34:02] and burned and took cities and there'll
[1:34:04] be no death in the millennium. You see
[1:34:06] what he's trying to say? So because some
[1:34:08] people I guess at that time thought that
[1:34:10] when they went into the Canaan land was
[1:34:11] the type of the millennium. Well, it's
[1:34:13] not. They had to fight for every inch.
[1:34:15] They was they didn't just walk in.
[1:34:17] Listen, it would have been real nice if
[1:34:19] the Amalachites would have run that way
[1:34:20] and the Philistines that way and the
[1:34:22] Hivites and the Hisites and all. They
[1:34:24] just run off. They fought.
[1:34:27] Amen. Remember cuz God told him said,
[1:34:29] "You won't lose a man." And then when
[1:34:30] they lost those ever how many men they
[1:34:32] lost in that battle, Joshua said, "Stop.
[1:34:35] There's a problem here somewhere."
[1:34:38] And the problem wasn't with God.
[1:34:41] The problem wasn't with Joshua.
[1:34:48] But another thing that it does, it
[1:34:50] brings up justification by faith after
[1:34:53] they believed in Moses and left
[1:34:57] Egypt. Sanctification through following
[1:34:59] under the pillar of fire and the
[1:35:01] atonement of the sacrificial lamb in the
[1:35:03] wilderness and then entering into a land
[1:35:06] that had been promised. You and I today,
[1:35:10] I hope by the new birth, you've entered
[1:35:11] into a land. Yes. that God promised.
[1:35:16] Now the book of Joshua was the Ephesians
[1:35:18] of the Old Testament. So brother Brown
[1:35:20] preached a sermon Ephesians parallels
[1:35:22] Joshua. So the book of Ephesians is
[1:35:24] placing book of Joshua is placing. But
[1:35:27] now remember book of Joshua was in a
[1:35:30] natural land.
[1:35:32] The book of Ephesians is in a spiritual
[1:35:34] land. All right. Read this and then
[1:35:37] we'll uh take
[1:35:40] communion. How that the book of Joshua
[1:35:42] was the Ephesians of the Old Testament
[1:35:45] and how it was a book of redemption and
[1:35:47] redemption has two different parts come
[1:35:50] out of enter into first you have to come
[1:35:53] out some people want to bring the world
[1:35:55] bring the world with them
[1:35:58] right but you got to come out of the
[1:36:01] world to enter into Christ you have to
[1:36:04] come out of the unbelief to enter into
[1:36:06] faith there cannot be one thing in your
[1:36:09] way to really have genuine When faith,
[1:36:11] you must absolutely leave everything
[1:36:14] that's contrary to the word of God
[1:36:17] behind to enter into faith. You know
[1:36:20] why? There is no unbelief in this.
[1:36:25] That's right. I believe this as a whole
[1:36:28] from cover to cover. That's right.
[1:36:30] Finish this. And that was the book of
[1:36:31] the Ephesians of the Old Testament.
[1:36:33] Joshua, Moses represented the law. could
[1:36:36] not save one
[1:36:38] person but grace could and here Joshua
[1:36:42] is the same word like Jesus Jehovah
[1:36:44] savior and now then we find out we have
[1:36:46] to come to another Ephesians another
[1:36:48] Ephesus now that's where we're
[1:36:51] at where that in our intellectual
[1:36:53] denominations and so forth and all of
[1:36:55] our educational programs has come to its
[1:37:00] Jordan because remember even brother Ram
[1:37:04] stood there in 1956 he said if America
[1:37:06] don't accept the word of God in this
[1:37:09] year.
[1:37:11] He said, "Don't even pray for them."
[1:37:14] Pray for people.
[1:37:17] Don't pray for this government.
[1:37:21] Goodness. Then we must have an Ephesians
[1:37:25] again. We must have an exodus to come
[1:37:29] out and go into for the rapture.
[1:37:32] Hallelujah. Right. And the rapture is
[1:37:35] not going to rapture babies. Amen.
[1:37:38] Remember, all babies go to heaven,
[1:37:41] right? Naturally, but spiritually, you
[1:37:43] going to have to grow up. You going to
[1:37:45] have to grow up or get left behind. One
[1:37:46] of the two. Let's stand to our feet.
[1:37:49] Amen.
[1:37:52] Next Sunday, we'll it'll be
[1:37:54] uh Easter Sunday, I think it will be.
[1:37:57] But just study on this right here.
[1:37:58] Romans 8:29 says, "For whom he did
[1:38:01] forno, he also did predestinate to be
[1:38:04] conformed to the image of his son that
[1:38:07] he might be the firstborn among many
[1:38:10] brethren." The Bible tells us that in
[1:38:14] Revelations, the
[1:38:16] last church age would be the beginning
[1:38:20] of the creation of God.
[1:38:25] how God wanted this thing done to begin
[1:38:28] with.
[1:38:30] Even in all this garbage that's going on
[1:38:32] out here,
[1:38:35] he's going to have a bride that's going
[1:38:37] to be without spot. You say, "Oh, no.
[1:38:39] That's when
[1:38:43] we Let's don't be like denominations.
[1:38:45] Let's don't Let's don't push things to
[1:38:47] to another place. Let's don't push
[1:38:49] things away to something else or
[1:38:51] somebody else.
[1:38:52] Let's say, "Lord, be it unto me right
[1:38:54] now."
[1:38:56] Well, we go through this adoption.
[1:38:57] Remember, Brother Dell told us years and
[1:38:59] years ago, God does not adopt the
[1:39:02] devil's children. He only adopts his own
[1:39:05] children.
[1:39:06] Now, the devil would love to have he
[1:39:09] does have his own children, but they
[1:39:11] ain't going to get the adoption like we
[1:39:13] do because there'll be power with
[1:39:15] character when we take a body change.
[1:39:20] Not until then. Because power without
[1:39:22] character is satanic. Let's bow our
[1:39:25] heads just for a second. Dear heavenly
[1:39:26] father, thank you for this word you give
[1:39:28] us. I pray Lord it'll sink deep in our
[1:39:30] heart and we'll see that Lord, you're
[1:39:31] trying one more time to get us to see
[1:39:34] that number one, we are the children of
[1:39:36] God, sons and daughters of God by the
[1:39:37] new birth. But we have to grow up. We
[1:39:40] have to quit drinking milk. We can start
[1:39:41] with it, but let's continue on to the
[1:39:43] meat of the word. Let's continue on to
[1:39:45] the grace of God that we can see that
[1:39:47] the end time is just for this thing is
[1:39:50] just made for the bride. This message
[1:39:52] was not sent to the world. It was sent
[1:39:54] to the bride of Jesus Christ. And it's
[1:39:56] our responsibility to hold that word up
[1:39:59] regardless of what people say about
[1:40:01] anything. Hold the word. If we'll hold
[1:40:04] the word, Lord, you said if we'll stand
[1:40:05] for you, you'll stand for us. And Lord,
[1:40:08] I depend on that. And I know you will
[1:40:10] because you are unfailing. You never
[1:40:13] made a mistake. You were never out of
[1:40:15] position. But you're trying to get us in
[1:40:17] position. And I pray that we do that as
[1:40:20] a church, Father, that we come to a
[1:40:22] place of maturity where you can not only
[1:40:24] use the the five-fold ministry, but use
[1:40:26] the the the ones sitting in the pews,
[1:40:29] Lord, the the ones, Lord, that come to
[1:40:31] church here, Father, that you can speak
[1:40:32] through
[1:40:34] them, and the things that they speak
[1:40:36] will come to pass. I just believe that,
[1:40:39] Lord. I believe you want you're wanting
[1:40:41] a powerful group of people. You're
[1:40:44] wanting a group of people just like you
[1:40:45] had in Ephesus where 12 people shook the
[1:40:48] world, but they were born again and
[1:40:52] under Paul's ministry, they grew in
[1:40:54] grace and knowledge. Father, I pray that
[1:40:56] you be with us now in the further of the
[1:40:58] service. Forgive us of our sins and our
[1:40:59] many mistakes that we make against you,
[1:41:01] Father. Lord, the word is here to clean
[1:41:05] us, Lord. the washing of the water by
[1:41:08] the word. Father, I pray that you'd wash
[1:41:10] us now continually, a daily
[1:41:13] sanctification, Lord, to keep us clean
[1:41:16] and forgive us, Lord, of we hurt
[1:41:18] anybody's feelings. Father, I pray that
[1:41:19] you'd just touch each of our hearts,
[1:41:22] Lord. Just let love continue to overflow
[1:41:25] in all of our hearts and be so much
[1:41:27] love, there'll be no hate there. Lord, I
[1:41:30] pray that you'd grant these things in
[1:41:31] Jesus name. Amen.
[1:41:35] Bible tells us if you go to 1
[1:41:37] Corinthians 11 verse 23. We'll begin
[1:41:40] with the communion service. For I have
[1:41:43] received of the Lord. Now this is Paul
[1:41:44] talking by revelation. For I have
[1:41:46] received of the Lord that which also I
[1:41:48] delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus
[1:41:50] the same night in which he was betrayed
[1:41:52] took bread. And when he had given
[1:41:54] thanks, he broke it and said, "Take,
[1:41:55] eat. This is my body which is broken for
[1:41:57] you. This do in remembrance of me."
[1:42:00] After the same manner, he took the cup.
[1:42:01] when he had sucked, saying, "This cup is
[1:42:03] the new testament in my blood. This do
[1:42:06] you as often as you drink it in
[1:42:07] remembrance of me. For as often as you
[1:42:10] eat this bread and drink this cup, you
[1:42:11] do show the Lord's death till he comes."
[1:42:14] Wherefore, whosoever shall eat of this
[1:42:16] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:42:17] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:42:20] and blood of the Lord. But let a man
[1:42:22] examine himself. That's why we stop.
[1:42:25] Examine yourself. You You can get a lot
[1:42:27] of sin taken care of in just a few
[1:42:28] minutes.
[1:42:31] Well, praise God. I'm I hope that is
[1:42:33] true because I've I've come to them
[1:42:35] places where I needed to pray and it
[1:42:37] wasn't very long for God to forgive me
[1:42:39] for what I just did. Y'all just pray for
[1:42:41] me. If if y'all don't do that, pray for
[1:42:42] me. But let a man examine himself and so
[1:42:45] lay him of that bread and drinkketh that
[1:42:46] cup. For he that eateth and drinkketh
[1:42:48] unworthily eateth and drinkkeeth
[1:42:50] damnation to himself, not discerning the
[1:42:52] Lord's body. For this cause many are
[1:42:55] weak and sickly among you, and many
[1:42:57] sleep. For if you would judge, if we
[1:43:00] would judge ourselves, we should not be
[1:43:01] judged. But when we are judged, we are
[1:43:03] chasing to the Lord that we should not
[1:43:05] be condemned with the world. How about
[1:43:09] that? He's told him right then that we
[1:43:11] not be condemned with the world. So he's
[1:43:13] pulled them apart, set them apart, set
[1:43:15] them aside. Same way he's done with me
[1:43:16] and you at the new birth. He's pulled us
[1:43:18] apart. Now we know the world the world
[1:43:20] gets on us but can't get in us. Amen.
[1:43:22] Amen. Wherefore, my brethren, when you
[1:43:24] come together to eat, tar one for
[1:43:26] another. If any man hunger, let him eat
[1:43:28] me at home. That you come not together
[1:43:30] under condemnation and arrest while I
[1:43:31] set in order when I come. This is the
[1:43:36] eating of the flesh and drinking of the
[1:43:38] blood that Jesus talked about. But it's
[1:43:41] by
[1:43:43] revelation. We can read it in the Bible.
[1:43:46] You can point your finger at it. It's
[1:43:48] actually in red letter. So, we know
[1:43:50] Jesus spoke it.
[1:43:53] But we're doing it by the
[1:43:56] revelation that come through
[1:43:58] Paul, come down through the ages, and
[1:44:00] came down to right here. And brother
[1:44:02] Brandham just said it all in order. He
[1:44:03] said, "We're not eating crackers, and
[1:44:05] we're not drinking grape
[1:44:07] juice. This is made with hands that are
[1:44:09] holy. This is made without anything.
[1:44:11] That's why it's so
[1:44:12] thin cuz leavenan makes things
[1:44:15] rise." But at this point in time, you
[1:44:18] know what? This should not be an
[1:44:20] enjoyable meal. That's why Paul told
[1:44:22] them when he came to the Corinthians, he
[1:44:24] said, I mean, they had the table, I'm
[1:44:27] sure, full of food and fruits and mutton
[1:44:30] and lamb and all this stuff laying
[1:44:32] everywhere and they're just eating and
[1:44:33] drinking and they said, "This is the
[1:44:35] Lord's supper." Paul said, "No, you
[1:44:37] better do this a different way, for I
[1:44:40] have received of the Lord." Amen.
[1:44:44] That you should do this and do it where
[1:44:47] it is a happy time, but it's also a sad
[1:44:49] time to to realize
[1:44:51] what somebody went through for us to be
[1:44:53] able to do this and do it what? Do it
[1:44:56] with a glad heart. I want this all done
[1:44:58] with a glad heart. We should not be
[1:45:01] sadfaced. We should be happy to be able
[1:45:03] to do this and know what it's all about.
[1:45:05] Amen. So, let's pray. Dear heavenly
[1:45:07] father, thank you for this bread. It's
[1:45:09] been prepared just for this moment,
[1:45:10] Lord. And when it's when we're finished
[1:45:12] and any leftover, Lord, it'll be burned
[1:45:14] for we'll have a fresh revelation come
[1:45:16] the next morning. Father, I pray that
[1:45:18] you'd bless it and sanctify to your
[1:45:20] people in Jesus name.
[1:45:29] Amen. I mean, you know, if you're if
[1:45:32] you're a real bornagain
[1:45:34] Christian, you'll be happy to take
[1:45:36] communion because you know what it's
[1:45:38] done. And it's also a time when we can
[1:45:41] and we'll stop here in just a minute
[1:45:43] before we um pray over the
[1:45:48] wine. And if there's anything in your in
[1:45:51] your heart you want to get rid of, now's
[1:45:54] the time to do it. Amen. All of us.
[1:46:03] Just think about a God though that you
[1:46:05] know a lot of times when we when we when
[1:46:08] we mess up at work usually there's
[1:46:11] repercussions and usually sometimes it
[1:46:14] might take a while before something's
[1:46:15] done or something you
[1:46:17] know God said you just pray pray with an
[1:46:21] honest
[1:46:22] heart and I'll forgive you. So let's
[1:46:25] take just for a moment before we pray
[1:46:27] over this let's take for a moment I
[1:46:28] forgot to do that. Thank you Lord for
[1:46:29] bringing it back to our memory. Just
[1:46:31] take a few minutes of silent prayer.
[1:46:33] Clear the slate. Pray for me. I pray for
[1:46:36] you. Pray for everybody, Lord, that's in
[1:46:40] this building. And Lord, even the ones
[1:46:42] outside the building that they'll come
[1:46:44] to see the
[1:46:55] Lord. Lord, thank you for the
[1:46:57] sanctifying of the blood. We know it
[1:47:00] wasn't the chemistry, but it was a life.
[1:47:02] But that chemistry also was a symbol,
[1:47:05] Lord, that you bled and died at Calvary.
[1:47:07] And now we can take this wine, Lord, as
[1:47:09] a symbol of your blood, Father. And that
[1:47:13] we'll take it, Lord, knowing that coming
[1:47:15] up here, the world's fixing to um have
[1:47:18] an Easter service, Lord, and we'll
[1:47:20] commemorate your death, burial, and
[1:47:22] resurrection. But Father, it should be a
[1:47:24] death, burial, and resurrection every
[1:47:26] day for us.
[1:47:27] bury the old me and resurrect the new
[1:47:30] me. Father, I pray that you'd be with
[1:47:32] each one, Lord. Sanctify this this wine,
[1:47:34] Lord. The partakers, Lord, partake of
[1:47:36] it. That you, Lord, help us all to
[1:47:40] realize that we're under a Joshua
[1:47:42] commission to go forward, not backwards.
[1:47:46] Cross the Jordan and be placed in a land
[1:47:49] that you promised we could have. What a
[1:47:52] great promise. An eternal God promising
[1:47:54] a piece of ground to a group of people.
[1:47:56] Father, thank you for it in Jesus name.
[1:48:00] Amen. Think about a an eternal God that
[1:48:03] made made an earth made an earth just so
[1:48:06] that we can live on it. And we can live
[1:48:08] on it for an eternity. Every one of us
[1:48:11] can. We can live for it for an eternity.
[1:48:13] This is our house. This is our home.
[1:48:19] You know, the world is not my home. I'm
[1:48:21] just passing through. But you know what?
[1:48:23] According to my prophet, we're coming
[1:48:26] right back here
[1:48:28] to what? Possess what? He gave us.
[1:48:32] Listen, he gave that promise to Adam and
[1:48:34] Eve,
[1:48:36] but they lost it.
[1:48:38] But they didn't lose it forever. They
[1:48:40] didn't lose it for an
[1:48:42] eternity. It was only for a short time.
[1:48:45] George Brother Ram said so eloquently.
[1:48:48] He said, "God was a savior, but he
[1:48:50] didn't have anybody to save." God was a
[1:48:53] healer, but he didn't have anything to
[1:48:55] heal.
[1:48:58] So by his providence, he
[1:49:01] allowed Adam and Eve to do what they
[1:49:03] did. So that he could develop the
[1:49:06] attributes that he had any because
[1:49:08] remember, he can't change his
[1:49:10] attributes. He can't say, "Well, I don't
[1:49:11] want to be that anymore." Now, a lot of
[1:49:13] us, we do that. We I don't want to do
[1:49:14] that anymore. Why? Because it's not
[1:49:15] good. But God can't do that.
[1:49:18] And as I was telling you, I was
[1:49:20] listening to brother Donnie or watching
[1:49:22] him this morning and he was reading a
[1:49:24] quote and I never seen the quote so I'm
[1:49:26] going to look it up again. But I know it
[1:49:28] was a quote of brother Brandham because
[1:49:30] he pulled it up on the screen. But
[1:49:31] remember I told y'all the other day I
[1:49:34] believe this message is so orchestrated
[1:49:36] by God that when brother Brandham
[1:49:39] remember he would stop and go uh uh and
[1:49:41] then he would make a statement. It was
[1:49:43] like maybe seems like it didn't always
[1:49:46] match what he was talking
[1:49:48] about. You know what that was
[1:49:50] for? Because God knew Donnie Reagan,
[1:49:54] Wade Dale, Aaron Roberts, Luis Ureo, Bob
[1:49:58] Black would need that quote
[1:50:01] to perfect the bride.
[1:50:04] So he said it the way he said it. The
[1:50:07] Bible was written the same way. It was
[1:50:09] not written by any one man.
[1:50:13] It was written by God so that we can
[1:50:16] read the scripture and know what it
[1:50:17] says. But it took a prophet to what?
[1:50:20] Shine light on things that man has
[1:50:23] covered up darkness. Said, "No, that's
[1:50:25] not it. That's not it over here. That's
[1:50:26] not it over here." Well, you'll see when
[1:50:30] we come to the end of this thing, you'll
[1:50:32] find
[1:50:33] out. Those who
[1:50:35] endure to the end shall be saved. We may
[1:50:40] not know, brother Boyd. We may not know
[1:50:41] till the end of this whole thing right
[1:50:43] at the change of the body who's made it
[1:50:46] and who hadn't or who's got it and who
[1:50:48] don't cuz there's going to be faults
[1:50:50] when you come unto that third pull when
[1:50:52] it's to the totally lost. Those totally
[1:50:54] lost don't think they're lost.
[1:50:58] Come on. They don't think they're lost.
[1:51:00] I'll read you a quote where brother Ram
[1:51:01] said he said they'll keep on thinking
[1:51:02] they're getting the Holy Ghost. You know
[1:51:05] why? Because they're taught different.
[1:51:07] Well, just believe the message. Just
[1:51:08] believe this. Just believe in a shout.
[1:51:10] just believe in this or or believe in a
[1:51:12] feeling. It ain't got none that nothing
[1:51:14] to do with that. That happens after the
[1:51:17] baby's born. Let's get the baby here
[1:51:19] first. We get the baby here. Then we can
[1:51:22] start shouting and screaming.
[1:51:25] Come
[1:51:26] morning, I'll walk by the
[1:51:31] river. I'll rest the
[1:51:36] evergreen tree.
[1:51:39] I'll
[1:51:41] carry my
[1:51:43] cross through the
[1:51:46] midnight. Come morning, there's
[1:51:50] glory for
[1:51:53] me. Sometimes I'm
[1:51:56] despised and
[1:52:00] rejected. And I question, oh
[1:52:04] father, how long? It ain't going to be
[1:52:07] long.
[1:52:09] And I take one more look at Mount
[1:52:13] Calvary. That's what we need to focus
[1:52:15] on. And it gives me the strength to go
[1:52:21] on. We get to sit down by a green
[1:52:24] pasture by a river that don't
[1:52:27] flood. Always stays the same. Praise
[1:52:30] God. It's the same temperature all the
[1:52:32] time. And we'll get to sit down with
[1:52:34] David.
[1:52:36] Say, David, what inspired you to write
[1:52:40] that? Solomon, what inspired you to
[1:52:43] write that? Tell me what you were
[1:52:45] thinking that day. I know what you were
[1:52:47] thinking. And by revelation on this
[1:52:49] side, I can see why. But tell me why you
[1:52:51] wrote that. He said, "Oh, well, I was
[1:52:54] persecuted. The people hated me. My sons
[1:52:57] turned against me. My wife turned
[1:52:59] against me." He said, "But I knew one
[1:53:01] thing's for sure. God was not going to
[1:53:03] ever turn against me,
[1:53:06] ever turn against
[1:53:10] me. I put my dependency in that,
[1:53:18] folks. Don't ever put it in a man,
[1:53:22] but in Christ."
[1:53:28] Amen. Let's
[1:53:42] protect. While they're taking up that,
[1:53:45] we'll continue on with
[1:53:47] the foot washing. When we get finished
[1:53:50] with the foot washing, um, I'll pray
[1:53:53] over the food here and, uh, and we'll,
[1:53:56] uh, continue on downstairs and eat a
[1:53:59] bite. And like I said, those you that
[1:54:01] want to go to the house about 4:00,
[1:54:03] we'll go down there and, uh, and learn
[1:54:06] how
[1:54:07] to. So, the foot washing when we see
[1:54:10] that Jesus was finished. Now, he knew he
[1:54:12] was betrayed. He knew the thing was
[1:54:13] going to happen. He knew that. Now, he
[1:54:15] knew he was in a position to know. He
[1:54:17] knew who was going to betray him. Of
[1:54:18] course, he knew before, but he knew this
[1:54:20] was the time he was going to do it that
[1:54:22] night. He knew that, but he still fed
[1:54:26] him communion, washed her
[1:54:28] feet. Supper being ended, the devil,
[1:54:30] having now put in the heart of Judas's
[1:54:32] car, Simon's son, to betray him. Jesus,
[1:54:34] knowing that the father had given all
[1:54:36] things into his hands, and that he was
[1:54:38] come from God, and he went to God. He
[1:54:40] rises from supper, laid aside his
[1:54:42] garments, and took a towel and girded
[1:54:43] himself. After that he pou water into a
[1:54:46] basin and began to wash the disciples
[1:54:49] feet and to wipe them with a towel for
[1:54:50] with he was gerted. Then cometh he to
[1:54:53] Simon Peter. And Peter said unto him,
[1:54:54] Lord, does thou wash my feet? Jesus
[1:54:57] answered and said unto him, what I do,
[1:54:58] thou knowest not now, but you'll know
[1:55:02] hereafter. Peter said unto him, Thou
[1:55:04] shalt never. Don't ever tell Jesus
[1:55:06] never. He'll explain it to you real
[1:55:09] quick. Peter said unto him, "Thou shalt
[1:55:11] never wash my feet." Jesus answered and
[1:55:13] said, "If I wash thee not, you'll have
[1:55:15] no part with me."
[1:55:17] Simon Peter said unto him, "Lord, not my
[1:55:20] feet only, but also my hands and my
[1:55:22] head." Jesus said unto him, he that is
[1:55:25] washed, he that's not saved to wash his
[1:55:27] feet, but is clean every wet, and you
[1:55:29] are clean, but not all. For he knew he
[1:55:31] should betray him. Therefore, he said,
[1:55:33] "You are not all clean." So, after he
[1:55:35] had washed their feet, and taken the
[1:55:36] garment, was set down again, he said
[1:55:38] unto them, "Know you what I've done to
[1:55:40] you? You call me master and lord and you
[1:55:43] say well for so I am. If then your
[1:55:45] master and lord have washed your feet,
[1:55:47] you also ought to wash one another's
[1:55:49] feet. For I have given you an example
[1:55:51] that you should do as I have done to
[1:55:54] you. Very verily I say unto you, the
[1:55:56] servant, that's what we were talking
[1:55:58] about in the in Galatians. The servant
[1:56:01] is not greater than his lord, neither he
[1:56:02] that is sent greater than he that sent
[1:56:04] him. If you know these things, happy are
[1:56:07] you if you do them. Let's bow our heads.
[1:56:09] Dear heavenly father, I pray Lord that
[1:56:11] now we'll enter into the footwashing
[1:56:13] part Lord that we'll Lord see that you
[1:56:16] humbled yourself and acted as a servant.
[1:56:19] Though you be Lord of all, though you be
[1:56:22] the creator and the one that saved our
[1:56:24] soul and saved the disciples there in
[1:56:26] the upper room except for
[1:56:28] one. Lord, you did all that knowing what
[1:56:31] was going to happen, but you washed
[1:56:33] their feet anyway. Lord, I pray that
[1:56:35] you'd be with us now. Let the words not
[1:56:38] return void, but accomplish, Lord, what
[1:56:41] it set out to do. And that's to adopt us
[1:56:44] after we get in the land and
[1:56:46] positionally place us where we're
[1:56:48] supposed to be. Father, I pray that
[1:56:50] you'd sanctify the food, Lord, that
[1:56:51] they're about to partake downstairs that
[1:56:53] everybody will enjoy it and have fun,
[1:56:56] Lord. It was it was made for us to to
[1:56:58] eat, Lord. And I pray that you would
[1:57:00] sanctify it. Be with each person that's
[1:57:03] here. Be with the ones that are not
[1:57:04] here, Lord, that couldn't come. I pray
[1:57:06] that you'd bless them, Father, in Jesus
[1:57:07] name we pray. Amen. God bless you and
[1:57:10] your sisters. Go downstairs.
