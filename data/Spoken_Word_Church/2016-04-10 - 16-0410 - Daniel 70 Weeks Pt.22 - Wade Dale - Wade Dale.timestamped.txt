[0:36] them and well she has her children but
[0:38] she has her child he done her child with
[0:41] him and she has children one good to
[0:43] have him here today what we're doing is
[0:44] we're going to stay on Daniel 70 weeks
[0:46] and this is part number 22 and we are
[0:52] beginning from the rapture of the church
[0:57] to that last week now as we spoke them
[1:00] many times before bro Luise and I will
[1:03] come by yesterday it's not like it when
[1:05] somebody I know somebody I know
[1:08] somebody's getting it when they can tell
[1:09] me what I'm talking about that's what I
[1:12] know that somebody's getting it well
[1:15] Luis was sitting there landing out and
[1:16] see if you can explain not by my
[1:19] revelation because my revelations do you
[1:21] no good you got to have your own right
[1:23] you got to be able to give an account of
[1:26] your own self of the hope that lies in
[1:29] you know that's the bottom all right
[1:30] give a reason of the hope that live
[1:32] within you so and there's two schools
[1:34] involved in the message but now remember
[1:38] there's no to school of thoughts in the
[1:40] Bible there's only one one because
[1:44] there's there's what the scripture says
[1:46] and that's it property God couldn't
[1:48] change it God can't even change it right
[1:51] God can't change his word he wrote it
[1:55] this way it is so we've been staying in
[1:57] Daniel 70 weeks strictly by the Bible
[2:00] knowing that is a Jewish time but if if
[2:05] the Jews is a timepiece then the
[2:08] Gentiles we're connected to Jesus
[2:12] and we're happy you will read right
[2:18] we're connected to the Jews right right
[2:22] all right so if Israel's our timepiece
[2:25] we need to look to them because remember
[2:28] we have no time piece we're just nations
[2:30] tongues were just a conglomeration of
[2:32] nations right but the Jews they are aced
[2:37] specific nation of Israel is specific
[2:40] nation they have a specific City to
[2:44] dwell in God gave them Jerusalem and
[2:46] that's the holy city so that's where
[2:48] that's even where we're going to do it
[2:50] all right so and he also give them
[2:55] specific things to do remember we went
[2:59] through all these days and all that so
[3:01] that's why we're still in to the feast
[3:02] day talking about them and we've come
[3:05] all the way through showing that Daniel
[3:08] 70 weeks is a specific time they have
[3:13] 490 years to be redeemed how you get
[3:16] that 70 weeks 70 of weeks what is the
[3:20] week seven days seventy times seven is
[3:23] what 497 years all right 70 there were
[3:30] not 70 days them two years they were in
[3:34] captivity no but remember though it's
[3:38] the seventy weeks of Daniel so it's
[3:40] actually seven two weeks so don't get
[3:41] confused with with the weeks because one
[3:44] week equal seven years which is for they
[3:45] got 490 so we we established a long time
[3:49] ago through the Bible and through even
[3:52] history that 445 bc according to
[3:55] Nehemiah that's when the Edit went forth
[3:58] to rebuild the temple according to
[4:00] Daniel 924 restore the city and the
[4:03] temple all right so we've come through
[4:08] now that the Messiah was cut off
[4:11] according to Daniel 9 he was cut off in
[4:14] a t30 killed put on Karl's crucified
[4:17] resurrected come back into the church
[4:20] ages for a couple of thousand year
[4:24] period but remember
[4:25] no time for the Jews coming for the
[4:27] Gentiles okay but we do know it started
[4:30] on that peg off in a t30 somewhere
[4:33] around there all right then in AD 70
[4:35] Titus destroyed the city scattered the
[4:38] Jews and they've never been back in
[4:40] their homeland until nineteen
[4:41] forty-seven when the property god told
[4:44] us that Israel was now beginning to be a
[4:46] nation because they were gathering the
[4:49] people back together because remember
[4:51] the God who will not deal with Israel
[4:54] unless it be in their own nation in
[4:57] their own country to have their own
[4:58] nation okay so God wasn't dealing with
[5:01] him down since 1947 God has been dealing
[5:05] with them but not in a spiritual form as
[5:08] far to say this remember they get two
[5:10] prophets we're going to read that here
[5:11] they get two prophets they come and
[5:13] preach 1260 days there's going to be a
[5:16] hundred and forty-four thousand go see
[5:18] you can't number that's why the Bible
[5:20] when it says there's a number you can't
[5:22] you can't number that's Gentile code
[5:26] sure God knows the number but it's not a
[5:28] counted number all right it's not a
[5:32] counting number but now the Jews is the
[5:37] 144,000 that's it this is going to be
[5:41] saved after the rapture there'll be more
[5:44] Jews than that because remember the
[5:47] original twelve tribes back that began
[5:49] in Abraham right after Abraham's town
[5:52] see they're going to make it to heaven
[5:54] ok they're going to glory but they're
[5:57] not this what we see in Revelations 11
[6:00] there was two prophets going to preach a
[6:03] certain length of time take out a
[6:05] certain amount of people then they're
[6:07] going to go into Raptor okay right Jo
[6:10] Ashline brother Brown said if we can see
[6:12] Israel as a timepiece and we can clock
[6:15] her time because brother man told us and
[6:19] see we haven't read hardly any quotes
[6:20] but I want to bring all the quotes for
[6:22] brother Brown said Daniel 9 24 is one of
[6:25] the most important scriptures in the
[6:27] Bible revelations five brother Brown
[6:30] said was the most sublime script come to
[6:32] bible because it speaks of redemption of
[6:35] everyone
[6:36] but Daniel 9 24 is one is the one most
[6:40] important scripture in the Bible wine
[6:41] it's a company's it's a context to tell
[6:46] us at the beginning of something and the
[6:49] ending of something if I got that we
[6:52] just background a little bit further
[6:53] from the new but this is this is
[6:56] years of studying it's like I told them
[6:59] for Eloise yesterday we were talking
[7:02] about talking about this and brother
[7:06] Dale's preach this many many times since
[7:08] nineteen seventy-four and people still
[7:11] don't get it let me it behooves us to go
[7:14] over and over and over till somebody
[7:15] gets it like I said today you weren't
[7:17] here but I gave you a little I gave you
[7:19] a rose before I buried you know okay
[7:22] okay thank you for telling it I said
[7:25] brother Lewis was talking to me about
[7:27] damn seventy weeks he was telling me
[7:29] what he saw he was telling me what he
[7:31] had seen to me that's the best thing I
[7:34] don't want you to go say something
[7:36] brother you know I don't even want to
[7:37] say hardly what brother branham's you
[7:40] know brother I'm said brother I know
[7:41] you're living bible yourself you need to
[7:44] become the quote book you know you know
[7:46] that was the problem with the fair sake
[7:49] they said we've got Moses his quote book
[7:53] jesus said if you don't know Moses you
[7:55] know me oh you're doing you know what he
[7:58] was telling them you're just reading the
[7:59] papers you're reading the letter and
[8:02] then you come back in the bar when you
[8:04] see that the letter kills right but I
[8:06] very good block if you got the Holy
[8:08] Ghost they'll have to connect with the
[8:09] word somewhere all right so and here we
[8:13] go in this last week because I got old r
[8:18] Eloise in the Bible it has three time
[8:23] periods according to national 924 a
[8:26] seven-week period member we covered that
[8:28] 77 249 that was the building of the
[8:30] temple then we had a sixty two week
[8:33] period okay so 62 and seven is what
[8:37] these details last seven
[8:41] 69 when I wait a minute we got 70 weeks
[8:45] we've got to determine I know y'all had
[8:49] to have that up real quick 62 plus 7 is
[8:54] 69 not 67 and a half there's no half
[8:58] than there because the people in the
[9:00] message see that most of the people in
[9:02] message see say that three and a half
[9:04] years happened in Jesus's ministry and
[9:06] there's only three and a half years left
[9:08] after the right to the church that's not
[9:10] correct there's only three odd years of
[9:13] Jesus's ministry after the rapture of
[9:15] the church but there's one week left to
[9:18] finish damage during the week I don't
[9:22] care who said what the Bible says
[9:25] there's a seven-week period a sixty two
[9:27] week period and a one-week period I want
[9:29] to 62 like in here we go what is 62 plus
[9:33] 7 plus 1 is that completes it so the
[9:41] chart we had before was 62 weeks and
[9:43] seven is 69 so when Jesus was crucified
[9:46] back over here what Jesus was crucified
[9:49] that cut off the Messiah that was 483
[9:54] years take sixty nine times seven it's
[9:58] 483 years so now 480 three or four
[10:03] hundred and ninety- forename trees how
[10:05] much salmon there's eight the only needs
[10:11] more coffee or something promise
[10:15] caught up in this game is user right no
[10:18] you know what it always happens it
[10:21] always happens you know you got kids and
[10:22] they say these all funny things and they
[10:24] do this little funny thing but when you
[10:26] have company come yeah and you won't
[10:29] think ears to do the more funny thing
[10:31] they don't do and the visitors are going
[10:44] today before you say roll over play dead
[10:47] they're all over anyway well it's which
[10:54] one's the most which one's the most in
[10:57] Delhi no we've got 483 years already
[11:02] finished not 486 and a half go that's
[11:07] what the people of the message say that
[11:10] brother Brown said what you did not say
[11:12] it in the way they said he said okay he
[11:17] did say there's only three and a half
[11:18] years left after the rapture of Jesus's
[11:20] ministry right no doubt right but the
[11:25] Bible says is one week level so the
[11:26] Prophet can't deny the word the word
[11:29] can't deny the Prophet okay so there's
[11:32] one week left after the rapture now if
[11:36] you'll go to the six-fold purpose and
[11:38] watch the six-fold purpose what is the
[11:40] 64 purpose we can almost tell it by
[11:42] heart number one is finish the
[11:44] transgression to make an end of sin 3
[11:46] make reconciliation for iniquity for
[11:49] bringing everlasting righteousness
[11:51] filezilla division of prophecy in six
[11:53] and North amor Foley now how you're
[11:55] going to do all that according to what
[11:56] the peoples of Messi's and I'm telling
[11:57] you 99 percent are the people the
[11:59] message have it wrong I'm sorry it's
[12:03] just what it is they have it wrong
[12:06] because look how you gonna bring in
[12:09] everlasting righteousness not too much
[12:11] holding cell division they didn't have a
[12:13] battle of Armageddon destroyed all
[12:14] that's right
[12:17] because the Bible's plane I was reading
[12:20] on over further about talking about the
[12:21] Battle of Armageddon the Battle of
[12:23] Armageddon and we read it last week and
[12:25] jacob's trouble God is going to destroy
[12:27] every nation then we read that guy's
[12:30] going to destroy every nation the Israel
[12:32] was dispersed it ok so this battle here
[12:37] I was telling the lease yesterday this
[12:38] battle is it's not spiritual battle this
[12:40] is a physical battle right this will be
[12:43] heathen against heathen man against man
[12:46] they're going to throw everything at
[12:48] each other and it's going to be an
[12:49] atomic explosion yeah right right not in
[12:53] those fired it look you got it that's
[12:55] way over and then by the dog and makeup
[12:57] okay cuz remember this battle doesn't
[12:59] kill spirits he just killed human beings
[13:02] right all right that's it this kills
[13:05] human beings there's nobody in this
[13:07] battle there'll be no by on this
[13:08] battlefield level that will have God in
[13:10] them or around them the great that's
[13:16] correct you got to watch these things
[13:19] all right the Battle of Armageddon it's
[13:21] not going to be a one-day battle okay
[13:25] one more time it's not gonna be I'm not
[13:29] going to be a one-day battle it's going
[13:33] to be a several maybe even a month or a
[13:35] year cuz if you blew if you shut up
[13:39] every atomic bomb they have on the earth
[13:41] somebody's gonna live through at least
[13:43] but what the half-light in the Bible
[13:46] they tell that the man will stand and
[13:49] his flesh will fall off while he's still
[13:51] alive when our last radiation told this
[13:55] i mean no John just didn't know he was
[13:58] looking at it because we may read it in
[14:01] a minute revelation 13 the image to the
[14:03] Beast which is United States makes the
[14:04] world to wonder because they can cause
[14:06] fire to come down out of heaven wow what
[14:10] is that that's war that's weaponry
[14:13] weaponry bombs
[14:17] just left that in Jocelyn in the street
[14:19] yep like Johnson in the streets it was
[14:21] it was cars but he didn't know how to
[14:24] say car alright so let's go to
[14:26] revelations 11 let we're going to
[14:27] continue right here so so the way I see
[14:31] it the way we see it is there's 400
[14:33] three years have been finished so
[14:36] there's seven years or one week left he
[14:39] shall make a covenant with many for one
[14:41] week and in the midst of the week he's
[14:44] going to cause the sacrifice and
[14:45] oblation to cease i'm quoting daniel 9
[14:47] 27 if you don't have your Bible okay if
[14:50] the middle of the week he'll cause of
[14:53] the myths he'll cause the sacrifice no
[14:54] blessing the seats he'll kill these two
[14:56] prophets we're going to read it here in
[14:58] a minute they're going to take a rapture
[15:00] and then all heck is going to break
[15:02] loose for a period of time okay but now
[15:06] remember another thing that people don't
[15:09] realize this daniel 9 says the people
[15:12] and the city daniel 9 24 70 weeks are
[15:19] determined upon thy people Jews and the
[15:23] holy city so there's two things got to
[15:25] be restored so how you gonna restore the
[15:28] city right here if what people in the
[15:30] message say that that said Dana seventy
[15:33] weeks the ends right here well My
[15:36] heavens you've got all this stuff over
[15:38] here that you got to deal with you're
[15:39] out of the Bible and let me quote one
[15:43] more time there is only 1260 days left
[15:45] of Jesus's ministry there'll be no
[15:47] ministry over here right but to rebuild
[15:50] that city according to his ego listen
[15:52] how many of you ready to leave you 42 44
[15:54] the raise your hand making them about
[15:56] you but if you ever do read it okay you
[16:02] read everything else you stay on
[16:03] Facebook three hours but you won't read
[16:04] 15 minutes for the particular one more
[16:07] time hello
[16:10] okay facing the wrong way but you thrive
[16:13] you facing their own book don't be
[16:15] placing a book one day but not a
[16:17] facebook but if you'll read Ezekiel 42
[16:21] 44 it is honestly it's a little bit not
[16:26] boring but it gives you dimensions but
[16:30] if you will start in 46 248 read 42 44
[16:35] 46 to 48 is absolutely nuggets upon
[16:39] nuggets upon nuggets knowing what we
[16:42] know it talks about the glory of the
[16:45] Lord coming through the eastern gate
[16:47] well who's the glory of the Lord anoint
[16:51] the most holy revelations 1921 that's us
[16:54] coming back into that city but read
[16:57] about it and how he rules and raining
[16:59] and that all the tribes will be sitting
[17:01] there right over right there's twelve
[17:04] tribes three on this side three on this
[17:05] side just like they did in in in the Old
[17:09] Testament because remember everything is
[17:12] restored back remember remember the
[17:16] twelve tribes there was two that got put
[17:18] out down and Ephraim they went they they
[17:19] they went whoring other gods Oh God put
[17:24] them away and put Joseph and leave I am
[17:27] right but now when you read and we may
[17:30] read it later not today but when you see
[17:34] them brother round even tell he said
[17:35] when you see them coming into the
[17:37] Millennium according it looking as equal
[17:40] it puts them all a text Yoda back out
[17:42] coach Joseph its top across takes Levi's
[17:45] out cuz Levi I really never had anything
[17:47] to do with the twelve tribes he was the
[17:50] one in the middle or they weren't the
[17:51] one in the middle the priesthood was
[17:53] separated then there were twelve tribes
[17:55] that's right alright so but you if
[17:58] you'll read in Ezekiel 47 I think it is
[18:01] you'll see where all those tribes are
[18:04] all back in ordering in God did forget
[18:06] him he just put him away for a little
[18:08] while but he had to bring him back oh
[18:09] that's the original playoff drives all
[18:12] right what I don't remember how
[18:14] the Bible was in Israel at the eastern
[18:18] gate because I think that they're gonna
[18:20] literally come to an asian game they
[18:22] have put a semi cemetery mark in front
[18:25] of that Eastern yeah nobody can't go in
[18:29] like one thing for sure that city is
[18:33] going to be destroyed we know that that
[18:35] city over there that's now when we
[18:37] destroyed if they drop an atomic bomb
[18:39] remember it says it means drawing the
[18:42] day that abomination which is the mosque
[18:45] of Omar is right there next to the city
[18:46] if they drop a bomb man you know one
[18:49] thing I'm sure it's gonna lock the whole
[18:50] place out that's why very time they
[18:53] don't share its little that's why you
[18:55] don't have to come back and build the
[18:57] temple because it says to thy people and
[19:00] the city now how you gonna build a city
[19:03] right here damn seven weeks and right
[19:05] here home as most people in the message
[19:08] believe it ain't even court in the Bible
[19:11] and ain't even knowing make good sense
[19:12] 10 Lewis said yesterday said he made
[19:15] goods in and it doesn't once you read
[19:18] the Bible it doesn't make good sense you
[19:21] just got to understand what a prophet
[19:22] said all right so now let's go back to
[19:26] here we read Jeremiah 31 through 18
[19:28] which is Jacob's trouble all right now
[19:31] we're going to read revelations 11 you
[19:34] can take your Bible or you can read up
[19:35] here on the screen if you want to now
[19:38] this is John on the Isle of Patmos and
[19:40] it was given me a read lock into a ride
[19:41] and the angel stood saying rise and
[19:43] measure the temple of God the altar and
[19:49] them that worship therein but the court
[19:51] which is without the temple leave out
[19:53] and measure it not freeze given unto the
[19:54] Gentiles and the holy city shall they
[19:57] tread under foot forty and two months
[19:59] now watch 42 months take 42 x 30 well
[20:08] right there it is they pull her 60 days
[20:10] i get adam for you
[20:19] now we'll give power and look he's going
[20:22] to answer it the next that's good and I
[20:24] will give power unto my two witnesses
[20:25] and they shall prophesy 1260 days one
[20:30] thousand a thousand two hundred and
[20:35] threescore was three times to 60 k 1200
[20:42] 1260 days clothed in sackcloth now who
[20:46] is that that's the two projects 1260
[20:49] days but 42 months the holy city shall
[20:56] they tread under foot forty to it listen
[20:59] it's going to be peace just because the
[21:03] Pope makes a contract with them but now
[21:06] remember they still things going to go
[21:08] on because what's going to happen is
[21:10] that's why I believe the Bible is very
[21:12] specific he says the city inside that
[21:15] city or around that city they're going
[21:17] to persecute these two prophets 144,000
[21:21] their own people throwing people because
[21:27] that's where they're going to be living
[21:28] in preaching the Word of God and all
[21:31] those other Jews it's looking for the
[21:33] Messiah to come they're trying to
[21:36] establish temple worship they're trying
[21:38] to put this together they're trying now
[21:41] so what if you spent all you know what
[21:43] if you spent 30 years trying to put a
[21:46] temple together and two guys walk in and
[21:50] start preaching in that temple like
[21:51] Jesus dip same thing walk in and say
[21:54] this is freakin mortar the one that
[21:58] you're looking for is already come and
[22:01] matter of fact he's here in us
[22:06] all of those digits like the DG since
[22:09] Jesus walked inside it I am the bread of
[22:10] life know where she goes in on the feast
[22:12] of unleavened bread in there over there
[22:13] eating bread he said I'm the bread of
[22:15] life they said you a man make yourself
[22:18] done that's what they gonna say to these
[22:20] two witnesses so there's going to be
[22:21] turmoil but they're they're not going to
[22:24] be able to be cut for 1260 days just
[22:28] like Jesus couldn't be touched for 1260
[22:31] days right he preached three and a half
[22:34] years right okay same thing the
[22:38] anointing are beyond these two prophets
[22:40] and will be able to kill them these are
[22:41] the two olive trees and the two
[22:43] candlesticks standing before the god of
[22:45] the earth and Feeny man will hurt them
[22:48] fire proceedeth our Mountain devour
[22:50] their enemies and if any man will hurt
[22:51] them he must in this manner be killed
[22:54] these have power to shut heaven now who
[22:57] that who did it he lied to shut the
[23:02] heavens for how long a half years he
[23:07] knows how to do it that's why Elijah and
[23:09] Moses no watch that it rain not in the
[23:13] days of their prophecy and have power
[23:14] over waters to turn them to blood who
[23:17] did that Moses turn the Nile River
[23:20] completely into blood and to smite the
[23:23] earth with all plagues as often as they
[23:25] will Wow if they want an earthquake to
[23:31] happen guess what all they got to say
[23:33] that's right if they see an army coming
[23:35] after all they got to do is just say God
[23:37] open up the earth and swallow him I
[23:41] don't county belton they gonna be hated
[23:45] absolutely said he opened up the and
[23:48] took Dayton and Cora all these all these
[23:51] types in the Old Testament are going to
[23:53] be fulfilled right here in these 1260
[23:55] days all right look and when they shall
[23:59] finish their testimony right about here
[24:01] that all right we're going to have
[24:04] another you are here button
[24:06] and we did that last last you are here
[24:09] well as we're talking you are here and
[24:13] then okay right at that 1260 day time
[24:16] period got it and when they shall have
[24:19] finished their testimony of the Beast
[24:20] that ascends a thousand bottle of the
[24:21] pits you'll make war against them and
[24:23] shall overcome them and kill them okay
[24:26] and their dead bodies shall lie in the
[24:29] streets of the great city which
[24:30] spiritually is called sodom and egypt
[24:31] where also our Lord was crucified so
[24:33] that is where Jerusalem night and day of
[24:37] the people in Canada in tongues and
[24:39] nations shall they gonna be sending
[24:41] facebook messages and instagram and
[24:44] hashtag two people are dead that we hate
[24:48] you know I mean really that's what's
[24:49] going to happen because what happens see
[24:58] the whole world's gonna see CNN CBS
[25:03] MSNBC they gonna turn their cameras on
[25:09] them into because what happens and they
[25:11] did dwell upon the earth shall rejoice
[25:12] all the nation and shall send gift one
[25:16] to another that's an old Roman tradition
[25:18] sending gifts when open about it was
[25:20] over and they'd win a war they'd send a
[25:22] gift somebody she'll send gifts to one
[25:25] another because these two prophets
[25:26] tormented them that dwell on the earth
[25:28] and after three days and a half lead
[25:31] back to that three and a half day period
[25:32] again so it's now three and a half days
[25:34] the spirit of life from God entered into
[25:37] them and they stood up on their feet and
[25:39] what about a reporter standing there
[25:41] reporting on these two decaying rotting
[25:43] dead bodies no way that's not too
[25:46] far-fetched because when when they kill
[25:49] Gaddafi couple years were here but they
[25:51] would show his but they were dragging
[25:52] his body around and everything
[25:54] never reported an all-around sure we
[25:56] remember when Saddam Hussein was
[25:57] executed you know huh yeah that showed
[26:00] it right down there yeah yep so I mean
[26:05] it's right it's really it's not it this
[26:07] is just a precursor to what's coming
[26:09] this is just shows what's coming all
[26:12] right all right know what they they
[26:15] stood on their feet and great fear fell
[26:17] upon them what saw them now we all
[26:20] remember one thing it's not spoken in
[26:23] the Bible but we realized that those
[26:27] 144,000 we're going to have to be killed
[26:28] also they don't have to be killed all
[26:33] right and they heard a great force boys
[26:35] from heaven no I'm sorry they stood up
[26:37] on two feet great fear fell upon them
[26:38] look solid and they are a great voice
[26:40] from heaven saying up to them come up
[26:42] hither now what happened to revelations
[26:44] for one John heard a voice that said
[26:50] come up hither that was the rapture of
[26:52] the bride you and I right so we come
[26:55] over a little bit further and right here
[26:58] after the 1260 days there's going to be
[27:01] another rapper come up hither that's
[27:03] right alright so the 144,000 and the two
[27:06] Jews are going to be off the earth
[27:07] that's why i said when you come to this
[27:08] battle of armageddon there is no
[27:11] christian anything it is raw heathen
[27:13] brother brownie even says the Holy Ghost
[27:16] is lifted off the earth so there's
[27:17] really no mercy when those two prophets
[27:20] leave this earth there will be nothing
[27:22] but absolute chaos okay the great
[27:26] tribulation the man I mean this is the
[27:29] Tribulation Period but this is the great
[27:31] tribulation all right but I watch and
[27:36] they had a great voice from heaven
[27:38] saying unto them come up hither and they
[27:40] ascended up to heaven in the cloud and
[27:42] their enemies beheld them in the same an
[27:46] hour it was a great earthquake a tenth
[27:48] part of the city fell and the earthquake
[27:50] were slain of men seven thousand and the
[27:52] remnant were afraid and gave glory to
[27:54] the God of heaven didn't do them a lot
[27:56] of good but still there might be a
[28:00] little time period in there where some
[28:02] of the Jews may try to get you know may
[28:03] try to get saved or whatever you know
[28:06] but
[28:06] me too too too late look what we talked
[28:12] about the wove the first whoa was to
[28:14] what First World War right the second
[28:18] wall is the Second World War all right
[28:22] now the third world war is not here no
[28:28] even though the raster take place for
[28:30] the Gentiles and there will be
[28:32] tribulation of earthquakes and all these
[28:35] things and these two jus these two
[28:37] prophets are going to be call it down
[28:39] firing whatever that's not the third
[28:44] whoa cuz look the second Bull has passed
[28:46] and behold the third whoa coming quickly
[28:50] third world war valve Armageddon
[28:53] termination of forces that's all nations
[28:56] that are left we're going to try to
[28:59] survive so they're going to be killing
[29:01] off millions of people I mean you got
[29:05] seven billion people on the earth it's
[29:07] gonna take a while to kill them all but
[29:09] they all got to die and the seventh
[29:11] angel sounded there was great voices in
[29:12] heaven saying the kingdoms of this world
[29:14] are become the kingdoms of our Lord and
[29:16] of his Christ and he shall reign forever
[29:18] and ever the four and twenty elders
[29:20] which set before garland seed fell on
[29:21] the face and worship God what they're
[29:24] seeing all this culmination 144
[29:28] thousands in their place now the two
[29:30] witnesses are in their place scriptures
[29:31] been fulfilled for everyone that has the
[29:35] Holy Ghost in their soul all right
[29:39] because remember you can't say
[29:41] everything is completely over because
[29:43] the foolish virgin is going to be living
[29:46] during this time and have to die give
[29:49] their life for what they believe they're
[29:51] going to go into grave and the Bible
[29:53] says that you won't see them for another
[29:54] thousand years right now they'll be
[29:56] given eternal life so you can't say
[29:58] eternal life is over no but you get all
[30:00] you can say hooting the problem with
[30:03] them they didn't have you Karloff in
[30:04] their soul all right all right though
[30:06] there was preaching that now you know
[30:07] about
[30:07] sold the spirit the body and all that
[30:09] you can be anointed on your spirit the
[30:12] Holy Spirit be true and you be false
[30:13] inside but right here everything goes up
[30:17] there's nothing left here but raw
[30:20] healing and they have a battle the
[30:24] nations were angry and I rapped is
[30:27] coming the time of the dead they should
[30:28] be judged see that's coming over here
[30:31] that now shooters give rewarding that I
[30:32] serve as the Prophet to the Saints and
[30:34] then they feel their names mulund great
[30:35] to destroy them once and should us
[30:37] destroy them which destroy the earth the
[30:40] temple of God was opened in heaven and
[30:41] they were sending his temple the octopus
[30:43] Testament they were liking voices
[30:44] nunneries earthquake and great hail God
[30:48] had lifted everything off the earth it
[30:49] was anything righteous because look I
[30:53] remember one thing seventy weeks is not
[30:57] finished yet though she don't got three
[31:01] and a half years left to do what build
[31:06] the city cuz everything is destroyed
[31:10] here right so they'll rats right there I
[31:14] don't have any quote for that and I
[31:16] don't have any Bible for that but I
[31:18] think we're supposed to read the love
[31:19] letter that's in between somehow them to
[31:22] the 144,000 killed you are going
[31:25] to have to come back here and right here
[31:27] they're gonna they're going to have to
[31:29] finish that's a for example of a temple
[31:31] but they're gonna have to build temple
[31:36] how I don't know the wait a minute hold
[31:41] on remember they only took him 52 days
[31:44] to build a wall back in natural time
[31:46] without any kind of equipment right okay
[31:50] so they can build this thing in short
[31:53] length of time but then revelations 19
[31:57] one is when the seventy weeks of Daniel
[32:01] is over when you read Ezekiel when that
[32:05] glory of the Lord enters at temple the
[32:08] bride 144,000 and the city has all
[32:13] fulfilled the redemption
[32:16] was written in this book for the ride
[32:21] 144,000 to witnesses they filled you Old
[32:25] Testament Saints you got it because you
[32:29] can't say redemptions fully over until
[32:32] the white throne judgment that's great
[32:34] because the because the fit the hunt the
[32:36] food is virgin is going to be given
[32:39] eternal life that's Redemption water
[32:41] about a cup of water my name anything
[32:43] like that they're over here so you can't
[32:46] say but what you can say is seventy
[32:49] weeks are finished 490 years in the
[32:53] restoration of Israel you say rather
[32:56] less and less that that's been a longer
[32:58] than that you guys take out the time of
[32:59] the Gentiles remember because remember I
[33:04] don't have what do you learn icon
[33:06] somewhere the charge it brother branham
[33:10] drew if I have that think I'm I with
[33:13] this chart that brother branham do watch
[33:16] if you were to take out the Gentile
[33:18] codes remember as we were talking the
[33:20] other day the wild olive branch was
[33:23] grafted in Luke 21 24 we were grafted in
[33:27] if not this would have come together and
[33:32] God would have finished the seventy
[33:33] weeks of Daniel right over here we've
[33:36] been left out ok ok this is the chart to
[33:40] brother brown drew now this is a
[33:41] revision of it I've got one of the
[33:43] original charge so i keep it at homes
[33:45] and i don't wanna lose that that's one
[33:48] he drew on a piece of paper in a
[33:49] restaurant that's the one he drew it the
[33:52] entire night all right according to
[33:54] Rebecca brown she drew that picture on
[33:57] the blackboard for brother ground to use
[33:59] during the same two weeks and am taking
[34:02] picture this one over here says not that
[34:03] one that one that one this other one now
[34:07] look this other one did you have
[34:09] somebody asked brother brought him a
[34:11] question about that later on he was at a
[34:13] restaurant and he grew it drew that on
[34:15] the piece of paper which is the same
[34:17] drawing is that one alright so there's a
[34:22] time of Gentile if you were to put this
[34:23] back together they'd been only four
[34:25] hundred ninety years
[34:26] she took out the time of the Gentiles
[34:28] 2,000 years and then button you got us
[34:33] going into rapture then you got one week
[34:38] or seven years left all right the matter
[34:41] those people don't come back in do I
[34:44] know oh jesus what kind of bodies or
[34:48] whatever I don't know I really know I
[34:51] really don't know I have no I know I
[34:55] have a lot but kind of floor it's gotta
[34:58] be something hot gotta be something like
[35:01] that but I would think that maybe that
[35:09] they come back in a glorified body but
[35:11] it's not because he means you travel
[35:13] like the thought we wasn't it we don't
[35:15] need to build a city where were we r
[35:17] glorified but somehow they got come back
[35:21] and build that temple brother Brian said
[35:22] many many times it is leaky or 42 44 is
[35:25] the Jews building that temple and in the
[35:28] Millennium you say okay what about the
[35:30] Millennium they look the Millennium you
[35:32] remember what we talked about lamp over
[35:33] mmm because we're going to read this in
[35:37] a minute something you to study on later
[35:40] on you got now one week at seven years
[35:45] yes right right 1260 days and then you
[35:50] got 1260 more days which makes 2520 days
[35:54] you got that 1260 plus 1260 is
[35:58] twenty-five hundred and twenty so
[36:00] there's got to be 2520 days to hear
[36:03] right but now let's go to daniel 9 real
[36:07] quick I mean Daniel nothing a man Daniel
[36:11] 12
[36:16] this is all about Michael standing out
[36:19] fighting for the people time of trouble
[36:21] such as never was that the nation never
[36:23] had that time the people shall be
[36:24] delivered every one that should be found
[36:26] written in the book come back right here
[36:28] all right let's going over at save time
[36:31] now watch this is daniel now remember
[36:38] this is daniel now i want you to look at
[36:40] this real good and one said to the man
[36:42] clothed in linen which was upon the
[36:44] waters of the river how long shall it be
[36:46] to the end of these wonders this is
[36:50] daniel asking and i heard the man
[36:53] clothed in linen which was upon the
[36:55] waters of the river when you build up
[36:56] his right hand and his left hand unto
[36:58] heaven and swear by him that liveth for
[37:00] ever and ever you remember with that
[37:03] happen also revelations 10 1 through 7
[37:07] the mighty angel comes down puts one
[37:10] foot on land one foot on sea and swear
[37:15] by him and live forever and ever that
[37:16] time shall be no longer that's to the
[37:19] Gentiles kind of shall be no longer
[37:23] there's no set time but watch this this
[37:25] is to the Jews because Christ is going
[37:29] to come down into profits really
[37:32] revelations 10 one is to the Jews
[37:33] because remember revelations for one we
[37:36] go up and not seeing the revelations 19
[37:38] everything in between them Jewish so
[37:41] what's this swear by him to live from
[37:43] there whenever that be for a time times
[37:48] time times and a half what's that yeah
[37:55] all right and when he shall have
[37:58] accomplished to scatter the power the
[37:59] holy people all these things shall be
[38:01] finished all right guy and I heard but I
[38:04] understood not Daniel didn't understand
[38:06] they said I Oh Lord what she'll be the
[38:09] end of these things he said go away
[38:12] Daniel for the worker closed up and
[38:13] sealed till the time of the white and so
[38:15] it's going to be open he said it sealed
[38:18] until the time of the end saying that
[38:22] when the top of the income still be open
[38:24] back up
[38:24] many shall be purified made white wicked
[38:28] will do wicked we know that's all
[38:29] happening right now watch nella and from
[38:32] the time that the daily sacrifice shall
[38:34] be taken away and the abomination that
[38:38] maketh desolate set up he breaks the
[38:44] Covenant right there right ah that's
[38:47] right he walks into the temple and he
[38:49] decimates the temple or desecrate the
[38:52] temple the Pope comes in says I'm god
[38:54] you gotta worship me right here there
[38:59] shall be 1290 days 30 more days left
[39:12] over leftover it's got to give us into
[39:15] the Millennium but when I finish blessed
[39:18] is he that waiteth and cometh to the
[39:22] 1,335 days that's 45 more day good about
[39:33] it right ok now this is where we're
[39:39] going to begin to get a little bit
[39:40] tricky because you have to go back
[39:41] you're gonna study feast days because if
[39:45] these days are not done away with
[39:46] they're actually full all fulfilled and
[39:48] you need those two time periods to
[39:50] fulfill you munch up goes remember this
[39:57] this is their Jubilee well I'm sorry I
[40:03] wrote about family
[40:04] if you believe to the Jews right there
[40:08] all right and time continues Khan
[40:12] doesn't end because remember if the
[40:16] seven churches continued on you showed
[40:18] up brother Ram told us the Millennium is
[40:23] still the old seventh day their birthday
[40:27] not an 87 okay seven not eight seven
[40:36] continued all the way to the future home
[40:39] then he brings in an eight-day holy
[40:42] convocation that seat time because
[40:44] remember sin is still going on right
[40:46] here the devil still alive his little
[40:48] demons are still allowed they just can't
[40:50] work because they are bound but they're
[40:54] still there for one more Bible right
[40:57] over here the Battle of Gog and Magog
[40:59] next when God is going to rain his fire
[41:01] not man's fire this is man's fire he's
[41:04] going to rain gods fire over here and
[41:05] he's gonna kill him demons they but one
[41:06] person to kill the demon that's good you
[41:10] can't kill a demon lord jesus christ on
[41:12] can kill the name why do you think that
[41:14] demons and leaders said why are you
[41:15] coming and torment us before our time
[41:18] they know they got time to go be
[41:19] destroyed okay so watch no next what
[41:23] we're going to do next week is we'll go
[41:25] back and we'll start to feast days we'll
[41:27] bring them in and we'll show you why
[41:30] they had to be 1290 and thirteen hundred
[41:35] and thirty-five it lays right in those
[41:40] feasts tape and keep that in mind too
[41:43] because we got still talk about the year
[41:44] 2026 okay now think about something
[41:50] 20-26 but when do we go into rapture if
[41:53] that's true seven years before
[42:06] cuz we're not here during this time
[42:10] we're here we call her after him hear
[42:13] you say you said today no I'm just
[42:15] telling you we gotta watch brother round
[42:17] said we could know the year in the month
[42:19] right I ran a quo a year in the month
[42:22] for the week or the month or year
[42:26] because remember remember the fees that
[42:30] are not been fulfilled yet start in
[42:33] October Jesus fulfilled all the spring
[42:43] feast he did not fulfill the fall feast
[42:47] the fall feast starts september-october
[42:51] November what is October first
[43:04] revelation 17 the seventh angel cries
[43:09] out God comes down and what he lays the
[43:12] sickle he harvests the week and leaves
[43:16] the terror alright so just just keep
[43:18] that in your mind because because that
[43:21] year that year's going to mean something
[43:24] that's always been there that you know I
[43:25] spend there a long time brother Dale
[43:28] preach this in 1974 then we could go to
[43:31] the Year 2026 not break scripture I
[43:33] wondered why and when I went online and
[43:35] this guy started talking about 20 26 in
[43:38] 2019 don't you think I listen the guys
[43:42] on him in the message he got a better
[43:43] he's got a better revelation today and
[43:46] saying two weeks and 99 fella people in
[43:48] this message does so the scripture
[43:51] that's what the same of monthly
[43:56] is when you do your calendar correct
[43:58] right all right okay all right let's go
[44:00] just think about that you look at it you
[44:03] want a little
[44:06] you
