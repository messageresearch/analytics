John first in the beginning the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God amen and Psalms chapter 40 verse seven and eight then said I know I come in the volume of the book it is written of me I delight to do thy will o my god yay the law is within my heart may the Lord and his blessings of reading of His Holy Word you may be seated thank you since I would like to title this little sermon this evening stepping out of the book stepping out of the book praise the name of the Lord like how you know brother Branham you know he he preached in the message you know in in perfect faith and you know identifications and all different one different messages isn't recognizing our position in the scriptures there's a divine identification amen and Jesus also said that it is written of me in the Bible so that means when the time has come when the season and over the age when when when he manifested himself this world that means is stepping out from the book praise the name of the Lord so it is written of me in the scripture stepping out of the book so my brothers and sisters I would like to read here quote question and answers 1964 brother Branham he said in paragraph 91-94 is it as wrong as you are in Christ you are in the Bible you are in him in the Bible as long as you are in Christ then you are in the fullness of the Bible praise the Lord as long as we are in the Christ as long as we are in the anointed Word of the power that means we are in the bride in the Bible amen praise the name of the Lord praise the Lord hallelujah can I take this yeah so my brothers and sisters this evening time so ah I need your prayers because I'm not I'm not used to preach in English language my language is different than here your language and I have got my accents and I've got my you know way of doing things and pronunciations and the words I don't know the very much English grammar but in a way the Holy Spirit is the speaker and he can use anyone he can anoint his ministers and he can put them on the spot and he can use them and for the benefits of the people of the bride of Jesus Christ so my brothers and sisters the divine identification to the believer is recognizing our position in the scriptures praise a lot we are you know identifying if we are identifying from with a group that's does don't do any good to us or for a certain denomination or a certain group of believers of a certain group of people or certain group of you know some kind of association or society or community that don't do any good but recognizing Buie we are in the scripture that's the great blessing to us amen that means stepping out from the book praise the name of the Lord that is it is written of me Amen praise the Lord hallelujah here I would like to just base I make I would like to lay some foundation for this message this evening time Daniel prophet Daniel pelegrin said is the scriptural prophet he always wants to know where he was and very easy and what age he is living in and he want to know he want to recognize his position he want to know the edge you know we want to know that circumstances and the situation's is growing through he want to know where he was at by the scriptures Amen praise the Lord Daniel you he understood various at in his day he said that I understood by books the number of the years wear off the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the Prophet so the piece is searching the scriptures is searching the scroll is reading the scriptures and you want to know the outside world the people don't doesn't have the revelation of Jesus Christ they don't know where they are living in in the day the Daniel also you know if you compare with other people he is totally different in a scriptural man he the spiritual man is a prayer warrior he's looking unto God and he wants to know what's happening in his present world the scripture praise the Lord hallelujah he understood by the books the number of the years where of the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the Prophet so why we are why would this all happening why would this going on why we are in this captivity and and the other false prophets and the denomination in that age you know in that world you know at the time they are thinking that is something you know this wasn't wrong you know something is not good but even he was searching the Scriptures he came to understand various add according to the scriptures he identified he recognized his position praise the Lord hallelujah and Virgin Mary recognized our position in the scriptures therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall consume we're essential call his name Emmanuel the scripture didn't says behold a virgin mary concealed it didn't say like that he didn't mentioned the name of say america but when the time is caught when the season when women that age came that when she was praying in her room or in the her living room or you know she was you know meditating on God and she was relevant him said she was exactly reading the same scripture at the table the angel of the Lord appeared praise God the angel of the Lord appeared but well random said when you talk about the Lord he will come hallelujah when you want to see him even appear whenever you want when you have a great desire in your heart to see him to want to see him then he will appear to you to not my brother sister tonight here the scripture says therefore the Lord Himself show a sign here written it didn't say about you know it didn't mention about the name name of Mary but when she was reading one day the scripture and the angel of the Lord appeared in her room and he said Shalom praise the Lord she longed to you and she was looked around and what is this happening and what so he the angel of the Lord said you're going to have a son how could I come how come and that means she has to recognize her position which was written in the Holy Bible that means she has to step out from the written pages of the Bible and living epistle of Jesus Christ their divine word payment rates award hallelujah that means some it is written about you and me tonight also that is written about Virgin Mary and she's coming out from the Bible recognizing her position from the scriptures praise the Lord and the Bible says let's see John the Baptist they asked what they asked him here we see they asked unto him John the Baptist who are there who are there that we may give an answer to them that sent us these people came from the denomination are Sadducees or Pharisees or you know whatever see if they don't see the word but they came from that you know that organizations that denominations and they went to the Prophet and they want to know who you are and what you want and what is going to do and here you see that we may give an answer to them in that sent us what says though of thyself right that the same question the Holy Spirit is speaking to our hearts tonight what says you about yourself what says me about myself tonight praise the Lord hallelujah what there's though of thyself what says though those thyself he said I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness make straight the way of the Lord has said the prophet Isaiah is pointing is courting a reverend the sculptures from the Holy Bible it's not identifying in from any other denomination I came here from a wilderness I eat my you know breakfast grasshoppers and honey and in the afternoon the line she the same and the evening generally the same you know I just came here from the villainess he is not saying like that but he's saying that it is written about me it is written about me in the scriptures if it is written about you in the beginning Book of World Records you will feel very good all that means you have done something great oh yeah if if a good player or a singer or a musician or a dancer or if anything perform if anybody perform a great thing then they put in the Guinness Book of World Records then and there and when they come and they will tell the people I am in the Guinness Book of World Records it is written about me in that book it is written of would be in that book see I'm in the grade book but it is more than Guinness Book of Allah this is the world the manifestation of this hour you are the manifestation of this hour we are the manifestation of this hour believe in Malachi 4 revelation 10 7 Luke 17 30 we came to believe and to access and receive the word in this age and we ought to grow hallelujah we are added why we are in the scripture it is written about me it is written about you not in some great kind of book over in this world but more than that the Holy Bible praise the name of the Lord aren't you glad for that things tonight amen we are blessed people on this faith of this year we are blessed people we are privileged people we more than conquerors through our Lord Jesus Christ by Amazing Grace by the word of the Lamb praise the name of the Lord hallelujah and here we see you know recognizing a repetition in the word and Jesus also he was you know when he went to the temple and the you know the scribe gave him a scroll and you all know that you know Saint Luke chapter 4 you know he was reading from book of Isaiah 60:1 and he was saying the Spirit of the Lord upon me he read for a Satan portion he read up to some portion and he lived the other and relevé and said you don't know you do you know why he lived another portion that is not where that what's coming that is where the second coming of the Lord hallelujah that is the second coming so he left that portion for the next time for next generation or the coming in the future you know praise the limb of the Lord hallelujah please bear with me because I have learned my English by listening to brother Branham so someone said you got because of some Kentucky accent ah I am learning all the kind of accents praising all praise the Lord hallelujah my brothers and sisters here we see Peter at the day of Pentecost you know he is also recognizing and that group 120 people they all recognizing or identifying in the scriptures themselves spread a lot but these are not drunken he said those people all the you know all different kinds of you know the country people or nations or different people they came and they are looking at them when the Holy Ghost fell down upon them on the day of Pentecost they were like a drunken they're moving in the spirit and worshiping the Lord in the truth in the worshiping in the spirit and through then they're just you know they're like a drunken people and moving here they're speaking in tongues and and then you know you know and prophesying and and worshiping the Lord and you know the gifts and all kinds of a signs and wonders and miracles are taking place and it's a revolver praise the Lord and the people you know the religious people the believers those who are claiming that they are believers in God a dead you don't understand what's happening everybody in phases are having a big question mark what is this what is this what is this what's happening why these people are jumping

America oh praise a lot that's breaking all different languages and there's also the outside world the denomination for all they don't know what's happening there but those who have the Holy Ghost there has a revelation of the word and Peter ignorant uneducated illiterate he can't read it he can't write his name but he stood offer all of that 120 people has it for this or not drunken as you suppose seeing but this is that which was spoken by the Prophet or is not pointing some of the books he's not pointing some other a bread preacher is Pro pointing to the Prophet Joel he's pointing his

according to the Scriptures and there must be a children in this Laster if the Bible says the heart of the children's back to the father's that means the children in the categories in the group in a bunch of believers you are there I am there I am one of them that means I am stepping out from the scripture Virgin Mary stepped out from the scripture and she recognized that is me John the Baptist stepped out from the scripture and said that is me the wilderness that is Christ and and and here Daniel stepped out from the Jeremiah scriptures and said that is me that is me and this is the age we are living in praise the name of the Lord you got to you got to recognize we have to recognize I have to recognize my position who we are and what we are in this age hallelujah praise the name of God

age and we are here just tapping out from the out of the pages of the Bible from written word to the Living Word the manifestation of this hour praise the Lord so that's why God God's prophet said we are we are the walking Bible praise the Lord hallelujah and here we see Bella Branham in the lava nation churches very familiar code to you all people and I would like to read this the people well banham he mentioned you know he wrote in the seven churches I love that book amen hope you love that book amen amen and seven churches love addition church age he said the people who took this revelation from God became the living epistles and read and known of all men for their generation that means they are coming out from the scripture just who are they who are both children that Elijah

doing his ministry there is again of people a children children to the word children of Heavenly Father children those who were born again but new verse now by a board of men not will of man Orvil of flesh they are born again Christians children of work children's of Almighty God so this man came to turn this children's heart back to the father's Pentecostal father's means not making them to see someone man-made but the word praise the name of the Lord the people who took this revelation from the God from God became the living epistle read and known of all men for their generation when the Methodists fail God raised up others and so it has gone through the years until in this last day there is again another people the manifestation it is written in the book of Malachi 4 revelation 10 7

came for my father and I'm going back to my father as the word I have the word hallelujah and there is again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age and that means the voice of God is in the bride today it's not another voice my brother sister this is the third voice which was spoken by God amen and also spoken by his prophet William Branham and that same voice someone asked me what is the message of the hour message of the hour is nothing but revelation ten seven that ten seventh umbral revelation ten seven the voice is in the bride

said what day it is that is this this thing that is this day praise the Lord this is the day that the Lord has made for his bride this is a bride's day this is the marriage of the last Amon and sister like the scripture says it is a beckoning of the bride and the bride and the five foolish virgins were sleeping that is the scripture it is fulfilling today amen we are in the scripture and stepping

they put all these people before they get into our interaction or if you are into the manifestation or they come before on the screen this man what they he wrote on his scripts he'll pull all these characters from the pages so same way not the all Marky's Hirata ever john the baptist through his prophet inspired a brave prophet I'm Sam and God is going to he know that is going to become a man so he inspired Isaiah he inspired joy inspired GEMA and murder all the inspirational words to write and when the edge has come this Daniel stepped out from the pages Haman and this joy Burgess Peter and

came to avec the bride of Jesus Christ amen we are in the group and we stepped out from the scripture and manifestation of this hour and just making our selves ready for the great rapture for the great event amen my brothers and sisters I do you do you know that of course you know that story you may heard hear that story from brother branham's message that little boy the country boy he had not seen out a mirror in his life so what happened he came ah he went to see his mother sister in the city so when he went to you see that mother sisters in the city that brother branham said that all the homes has our door a mirror we hide the door so this little boy walking around the house and jumping and playing and you know he went to you know you is looking at all the house and just enjoying his visit and and he went to one well he went into one room and he closed the door and he just went in into the room and he looked at all these things and when he Stern like that the door was closed and there is a boy standing at the door and he looked at that door and he said he waved his hand like this and that boy in that mirror is waving his head and he pulled his finger and that boy he pull his finger too and he started huh who is that and he started walking clothes and clothes and clothes and all of a sudden he screamed our horror mama it's me he warned her surprise mama it's me so my brothers and sisters - not as long as he was afar to that mirror he could not recognize or Alan while he was in that in that in that mirror but as he watched walked very close to the mirror then that that shows him that tall him that it's not some kind of person in that it's not some alien or he saw some any other person that is you hallelujah that's you right it's telling that's you and his green resin mama that's me bah bah bah bah ego that's me oh Jesus that's me I mean the level that you've done so much I'm America war I'm in groups I would enjoy be I'm in the SIS work I praise the Lord hallelujah aren't you glad one that says to my hallelujah my heart jumps because this message is what is eyes nothing can pull me out because jesus said my sheep hear my voice and they will follow me and the same word in the bride today and the voice the voice of God the feet of God inside of the bride and the deep calling unto the deep the voice coming out and hear the same worth being amen to that is matches and in pulse it drops that's a love affair that's bringing together in a vetting Union that no one can separate them from the Word of God hallelujah aren't you glad for that first animal for your sense of God tonight I'm rejoicing in the Lord I haven't went to the prophets of course yet but here I would like to read this a natural mirror shows who we are on the outside but the spiritual mirror God's words shows who we are in the inside hallelujah it's a great scanner scanning mission is more than scanning mission lo I come though i come in the volume of the book it is written of me it is written of me I delight to do thy will oh my god yay the law is written is within my heart Bible says the word is my V and your miles and it's in your heart which we speak the word of faith faith is a revelation the revealed word Amen praise the name of the Lord and Bella Branham said in crisis the mystery of God revealed in paragraph 240 is that the new birth is Christ in Revelation God has revealed to you the great mystery and that's a new verse it's a revelation to us it's a personal revelation to us amen as long as we get to go through the word as we get to close and closer and closer and closer to the Word of God that gives you that revelation no one comes and tells you this this is a this and this is that and this is that moment though one has to come and tell you like that no one you know need any help because when you get closer and closer and closer to the Word of God that makes you so that's why Jesus said and that day ye shall know by yourself that's a personal revelation I'll change the plot to you saying hey man praise the name of the or gory to God the new world is Christ is the revelation God has revealed to you at a discreet mystery and that's a new birth now what are you going to do when you get all the group together where the revelation is perfectly harmony hallelujah and God expressing it through his word by the same actions the same things that he did making the word manifest say the making the word manifest he did the same it is written about Jesus now in the Isaiah 53 and he manifested after 700 years later the scriptures spoken about Jesus and he can here he come hallelujah praise the Lord the same things that he did making the word manifest Oh in the church only knew its position it will one day then the rapture will go when it knows what it is how can you know you got to get closer closer and closer to that mirror and that makes you feels you shout make you shout and jump and rejoice because the manage of the lamb is come crazy name of the Lord hallelujah my brothers and sisters I would like to read here some course what brother Branham said about these things my brothers and sisters Frank so name of the Lord hallelujah and he said in perfect faith here now the only thing you have to do dance is have faith what you are what you are that means what we are hallelujah we got to have faith hallelujah even the devil believes the word and the same devil comes to you and tell instead of you instead of you hell you got you have to believe that you are the sons and daughters of God and the devil comes and tells you that you are not a son of God you're not this and you're not dead and you know simply he is try to pull you out from the presence of God but if we are getting closer and closer and closer like the little boy he stepped and he walked he closer and closer to that mirror and he screamed he shouted he said that is me hallelujah I am in that mirror I'm in that book I'm in that Scripture that is me praise God it is more reasonable chewing of goop Guinness Book of World Records but the grade book heavens and earth shall pass away but this book will not matter this book is a Word of God you are stepped out from these pages of the Bible hallelujah and and and I've seen just just few minutes ago this is these messages on my heart to preach here so I just saw when I went to the pastor's office I've seen some Bible evolution a little picture on the table of Pressler Samuel deal you know it's like the Bible opened and one paired you like that opening like that and another page one page is going up like that in the picture and some other pages becoming like a little thing like that and then after a person and then after Jesus Christ that means stepping out of the pages of the Bible the word manifestation written from the written word to the Living Word hallelujah it is written about you it is reasonable to me it is written about us in the Holy Bible in this last day and we are the manifestation of that word Ronna amen have faith in watch the word says you are and Jesus had faith in word of God and that said what he was it is written of me he said it is written of me if mister Jesus Christ said that we are claiming that we are in him what a vote mrs. Jesus Christ today she is coming out of him and she is also saying the same thing it is written about me hallelujah glory to God hallelujah I am so happy for that my brothers and sisters here brother Branham said in the same message perfect faith Jesus had perfect faith he had it and it come because he was the word and you become the word you become the word as you receive the word amen as we receive the word we are becoming the word that means heavens and earth shall pass away the Word of God shall not pass away mrs. Jesus Christ will not pass away mrs. lamb of God will not pass away Amen we are in him we came out from him and going back to him we are the eternal law we are please of God hey man give me abide in me and my words in you my words which this word abides in youth and asked what you will and it will be done swear you see if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt but believe in what you have said then you shall have what you said when you pray believe that you receive what you ask for and ye shall have it it will be given to you time-space nothing else will ever change it praise God you know it's done it's already over with now watch now he said to us if you abide in me and my word in you st. John here you can ask what you will it will be done then recognize your position in the scripture in the scripture so whatever I am preaching tonight it is from the prophets message now the thought the topic the title the sermon whatever I want to take I'm taking and what am preaching it is from prophets word recognizing our present character recognizing our position in the scripture praise the name of Laura recognize your position in the scripture as a believer so see you have got to recognize your position has he recognized his position Amen and I would like to read here what he said he will identify himself in you with the scripture praise the Lord and that is a true sign that the Holy Spirit is in you because it is the word he will recognize he identify himself in you with the scripture hallelujah amen and as we look into God's words let's identify ourself but he gave others in there four examples of what we are so let's see if we can identify our praise stage now with Bible characters Bible characters character is a victory amen amen praise the Lord you can identify yourself anywhere you want to in the scripture if you are a Christian hallelujah praise the Lord I want to identify myself in the Romans 8 I am more than conqueror through our Lord Jesus Christ I want to identify my present character from the Scriptures it is written about me in the Bible lo I have come as it is written about me I am here just stepped out from these pages Alleluia stepping out from the pages of the Bible stepping out of the book stepping out from the pages of the word stepping out from the scriptures it is written about you your character about you now it is coming outside praise the name of the Lord hallelujah so my brothers and sisters here he said up the word creates a character we know that now we look into his mirror and island-y ourself by same person in the Bible right like that little boy he don't know about the mirror but when he has seen that mirror that made him thrilled surprised wondered Oh what is this just looking like me my same pant and same shared and CMEs Thailand looked in same thing you know when he get close to that mirror see here what brother

by the blood of the Lamb of Jesus Lamb of God and we are saved by faith by grace praise the Lord amen here what relevant said I would like to read here he said God is in man and he is identifying himself today in his church in the born-again Christian God other device himself that he remains God and the outside world will only know that no God as they seek God in you and me amen and amen that's the only way that there is no God is when we are written a pistol a pistol all the scripture we are relevant and the life that we live reflects what's on the inside of us hallelujah a man is island-y by the words that he does so our words should be good see always good because we are representing our Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah our Lord Jesus Christ we are representing whatever the inside if we are filled with the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost reflects our life if we are filled with the message of the hour we are the walking message hallelujah if we are filled with the Holy Bible we are the working Holy Bible if we are filled with the Scriptures we are the Holy Scriptures living epistles of Jesus Christ amen when Lord Jesus when the Holy Spirit help us amen amen and amen
