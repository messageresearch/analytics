don't know what's going on but he's about the only one that's not here so good to see each and every one of you thanks for holding the fork down while we were gone this weekend we had a good time with brother pageants and we got all his water situations settled with his baptistry and got all that he he had enough chlorine in it to I didn't know if the the spirit of the Lord was there in the meeting but everybody was crying there was so much chlorine in there in that little room until everybody was pretty much crying their eyes out and we helped him get that uh straightened out so uh good too uh good to be back in the house of the Lord amen thank you for all your prayers uh dad and mom enjoyed their time over there too seeing brother and sister pageant and we sure do appreciate him for letting us come over there and uh and be with him good to see uh Renee and Isaac that would be a cousin right that's not boyfriend so y'all don't worry about it they sit close together that's not that's a cuz all right oh wait a minute George never mind they're from South Carolina so they must took a wrong turn and didn't go up you come this okay good thank you but good to have them with us so uh um always good to have such Renee and and her family with us so just uh greet them with love Lord good to see Anderson and and sister Anna and Sister Sarah and sister David back what sister David brother David's back with us sister David good to have you back buddy gonna have them back with us amen if you got your Bibles let's turn to John 1 and we'll continue on uh I would I was preaching a little bit on the Statue of perfect man this weekend on uh brotherly kindness and I kind of you know felt home so I just kind of drilled him a little bit you know and sister um what's her name Rita Montgomery afterwards she come out and she was stepping like she was stepping over stuff in in the aisle and I said what are you doing she said I'm stepping over all this loose skin laying on the on the ground that we got shaved off during the service today so just uh step over to loose skin as you go outside because we're still going to talk about brotherly kindness uh take it a little bit different angle with it because there was a time in the Bible where there was a prophet and a real good Holy Ghost Field man they parted ways Paul and Barnabas they had such a sharp contention so that one went one way and one with the other but they were both Holy Ghost Field people so let's let's uh let's look at that and um and see what we can come you know you gotta it's got to be a balance like brother George Smith said you know he brings his rule he brings his level with him and lays it out you know it's got to have a balance well you do have to have a balance you can't get run over but you got to have brotherly kindness and love them whether they love you or not all right and as brother Ryan said our Ruth Camp is going to be this coming weekend that'll be when all the missionaries come and if you want to go we're going Thursday and Friday come back Saturday with brother Keith Reed and sister Francine's coming with you so we sure uh the girls are not going to get to come they didn't renew their visa in time so they're not coming but it's at Francine and Keith will be here with us probably three or four days all right this coming Saturday not this coming Saturday the next Saturday which will be August the 6th or 7th or something we'll have in Bible study all right brother Keith will be here so we'll have Bible study but we're going to have prayer meeting from five to six I know some of you hadn't wanted to do that uh to not have too many Saturdays coming up here and and also we'll start at five o'clock we'll open up Saturday at five o'clock and between five and six you can come up here and pray for the meetings coming up we've got brother Jason Jackson coming brother Keith will be here that Sunday and then we've got several other meetings coming up with brother uh Andrew Glover in September the third Saturday there will be our youth service so we're expecting a good time but but that will be from five to six not this coming Saturday the next Saturday all right and then from six to eight we'll have Bible study I've got several good questions already um to uh to discuss so we're going to try to do that we sure do appreciate people I think it's good to go down and ask questions but it's good already to give them a little bit ahead of time so you can study a little bit and get some quotes together and all that and also I want this coming Sunday um we we're at the part of the Statue of perfect man at brotherly kindness I know some of you kind of got in at the middle or last or whatever but uh and go back and watch them that's why they put them online but that Holy Spirit right there we're going to really talk about it Sunday we're going to talk about the the baptism of the Holy Spirit and then brother Branham talks about the true baptism not that the bottom one's false but it's a quote I'm gonna quote the quote to you probably tonight if we get to it but that's what we're going to focus on Sunday is number one do you have that Holy Ghost at the bottom now if you do then we're we're going to look at the anointings that you have that are virtual knowledge Temperance patients and then that Holy Spirit at the top of the pyramid it's very very important you can't go any further The Headstone can't come you can't get a revelation of the son of man without that so you can't be a baby you've got to be an adult that's why we've been speaking for 121 Services now and brother Dale's been doing it for way more than that to try to get us to grow up the the ministry in this message is a growth Ministry it's to it's to grow it's to not be babies is not to be a bunch of sniffling um youngins but to be able to eat meat all right and if you're not then if you've been here long enough and you're not then it ain't brother Dale's fault it ain't God's fault so whose fault is it so it's my it's our fault that we're not in position we need to be because we all need to be in position if we don't then we're going to get left behind all right so let's look at part 121 on the cinema you can't see that can you okay technology for the older ones in the back there you go all right so let's read and then we'll pray in the beginning was the word word with God the Word was God and that word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory to go the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth remember that flesh that flesh had to be perfected because it was not perfect Jesus Christ's flesh was not was not Eternal it was not perfect all right it had to be made perfect as the Bible says and going and growing in Grace and knowledge so if he did I know we do all right so let's power his Lord thank you for this evening little the weight Lord may we just talk about you for a few minutes and be settled down here father and just hear from you Lord I pray this should be with the ones that are sick the ones that are not with us tonight Lord the ones that are sinsick Lord more than anything father I pray for our spiritual healing of the soul lord we love having um the healing of the body but Lord I pray that you the ones Lord that are as we're talking about some may not know what the Holy Ghost is and how to get it and all those things it's been taught so many different ways brother Brown said it's very ill-taught subject 50 60 years ago and it still is but I pray Lord that you would just break back the scales from our eyes just for a few minutes and let us see you father just give us this day our daily bread in Jesus name we pray amen you can be seated God bless you I'm good see Sister Mary back with us I told her she should have got a red dress instrument yeah just remember too brother Jason Jackson is going to be here the second weekend and we're going to have a Saturday night service at six o'clock and a Sunday one service uh brother Dutch and his uh crew are going to come be with us that Saturday as far as I know so also too just for FYI I went um you know I went last Wednesday and had a uh a scan of the prostate and they did find something so that's something they're going to go in and do a biopsy and see what's going on so um not worried about it but still let's pray about it I do not like those biopsies if you may have never had one please don't ever get one well you need to be screened but but as we get older uh it ain't fun I know your sisters have to go through all the mammograms and all this stuff like that but we do have to go through certain things like that too so just keep me in prayer and uh they're going to do it within the next couple of months and the doctors didn't seem real concerned but he was concerned enough to where we're going to go further and have a another biopsy there was a two small spots there that shouldn't be there so so Philippians 2 verse 3 says let nothing be done through Strife for vain Glory but in aloneness of mine Let each esteem other better than themselves we have got to get away from self we have got to get away from selfish all right selfies that says whole world is nothing but selfish we're all selfish look you take a little kid take a little kid and put them downstairs put three kids together give them one toy and let it be one of them's toy and not the other two well I don't have to say anymore if you had kids I'll promise you you know what I'm talking about there's going to be a fight called mine that's mine why because they've grown up selfish so as adults we shouldn't be that way though so if if we have something let's share it so let's share the word of God let's share let's share our experience let's share um the Lord with people um I was today or yesterday I believe yeah yesterday I was at the restaurant there in Gillsville and that was a brother a man there that was uh he's a retired police officer and he wants to get in the city so we were talking about getting in the city and and all the things and he asked me what I did besides you know he said and you he knew I worked at post office because I didn't run his mail every once in a while but he said what else do you do I said well we got a little church up here in Lula Georgia out on the main on the highway here he said William Branham I said how'd you know that him and Mike Canada had been together forever he said I believe that baptism he said they ain't father ain't no title I mean father is a title it ain't no name and he said that trinitarian Doctrine he said I don't see it he said but now I don't see that brother Brown was the only Prophet we need to listen to I said well that's okay we can start there there was no pushback there was nothing you know but he had been with brother Mike Canada and doing some things while he I guess while he was on patrol here in Gainesville now he's retired and lives in guildsville so we're going to speak further all right so at least there was no you know pushback but he knew about the church here because as soon as I said that he said William Branham so he knew that um that we believe that God did send us a prophet and we do believe he's the only Prophet but there are prophets in the five-fold ministry that's why I told him I said you can't take there's prophet in the file for Ministry but there's Major Prophets to each generation and I said we just believe he was the major prophet to this generation according to the Bible and he said okay and you know we kind of had to go separate ways and but just pray that uh that we'll say the right thing and uh he's just a real good guy and uh he's not very old for to be retired he must start real young so First Corinthians 2 verse 12. now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god now see we receive the spirit of the world that's what we're going to get to about the Holy Ghost we receive the spirit of the world when you were born your natural birth puts you in the spiritual part of the world the worldly part all right then what happened you had to be transferred or that kuckleber nature had to be burned out of you and had to be a wheat nature put in but you still look like the same kookaburra all right everybody with me but the spirit which is of god now we have received now he's telling the Corinthians that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God which things also we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teaches but which the Holy Ghost teaches now when the Holy Ghost teaches us something brother George it's always right it's all what you can depend on that now you can't depend on man but you can depend on the Holy Ghost because he's going to teach you and it says look comparing spiritual things with spiritual and brother around tells us and I'm not going to read it but that we are supposed to be spiritual people amen we're supposed to have spiritual Insight we're supposed to be Eagles we're supposed to be little Messiahs brother Ram told us and we've had these things told to us for years and years and years when are we going to start believing that it's happening to this generation it's happening to you and me not for somebody else it's happening now all right and it's happening to somebody whether you see it or not you say I don't see anything well maybe it's not for you sorry how can you say you're not seeing anything and we've got the word of God coming every Sunday and every Wednesday all these brothers um I learned one thing for sure don't don't go reach for a doorknob in a car if the Lord tells you not to ask Bob it's embarrassing though you had to go back in to get the key from my bless your heart it'd be all right and I'm sure Monica's like what are you doing I need the keys life lesson number you did some life lessons don't do that especially when you don't have the key in your pocket so now just for a second we're going to look and see it is hot up here the the birth is not the anointing and the birth the new birth is not the adoption but it's all intertwined they're by with me though you get everything you need at your new birth now that when I say the birth that means the new birth that means that the the life of God is now inside of you not on you in you that's the difference in the anointing the anointing we we talked about it up at uh up in Tennessee uh at brother Andres and he said to tell you hello again he really enjoyed him we've been texting back and forth for the last several days so he said tell you hello and he really enjoyed the services but there is an anointing that it's a true anointing of the Holy holy God is God it's the true Holy Ghost but it will anoint a person that's totally false that won't let God in their soul I said that won't let God in their soul so it's what you decide you can be and that's that's the whole thing I see is we're going to talk about it Sunday and we'll read it if we get to it but there was a time when Paul was in the upper coast of Ephesus and he finds a group of believers believers and he said if you received the Holy Ghost since you believed they said what are you talking about well see let's bring that to now there's a lot of people in this message when you tell them that they go what do you mean I've been in a message for 45 years I live by John quote brother Brown's message they know what they said Paul said how are you baptizing oh we were baptized unto unto John what's great he's a prophet he was the third coming of Elijah that sounds wonderful but Paul says ain't gonna work this day you got to go further you got to get the Holy Ghost and they said well tell us about it so Paul I believe it wasn't just two scriptures I believe Paul expounded on the Holy Ghost laid his hands on him and Holy Ghost came on him because they were what they were sincere and they wanted the word of God they just had nobody teach it to him right so we'll read it this Sunday where brother Brown said it's the most ill-taught subject in the in in the Bible is the new birth and we'll get to it in just a minute but the anointing that you can be anointed by the devil all right most of y'all and me have been anointed by the devil a lot in our life well I'll amen for all of you because he was the first anointed cherub he was the man that God put right beside of him that says you're my anointed cherub you are going to be head anointer right it might no other you are the head anointer and look what happened he's the Bible says iniquity he says in Ezekiel he said you were perfect now this is God talking to the devil you know talking to Luther he said I made you perfect I made you to be the anointed cherub that I would send by anoint send my anointing through to the people boy does he not but he don't do it God's way does it his own way a little bit of selfishness come about he wanted to be God he didn't want to be he didn't want to be beside the Lord he wanted to be the Lord amen so there's an anointing there and we'll talk about in just a little bit so in the adoption series though brother Brown said what is adoption and that's what we're going to get to because adoption is up there above brotherly kindness where the Holy Spirit moles and and covers everything and we'll read it in a little bit but remember brother Brown says your adoption is not your birth all right you receive the spirit of adoption according to Romans 8 you receive the spirit of adoption whereby you cry daddy daddy well you're not going to cry anymore if you become an adult all right everybody with me so you've got your new birth you've got an anointing to that new birth then you've got an adoption that covers unto that new birth but you can be you can have the new birth and not be adopted you can have the new birth and you can be anointed by the devil come on I thank God for a for a prophet that told us that if if uh if a brother took took their life right well you know boy you tell that to a Baptist now Baptist will tell you if you commit suicide you're going to hell I mean straight shot right to it you ask them ain't no chance no way well thank God he sent us a prophet they told us that you could be anointed in your in your spirit realm so much by the devil until you turn yourself over to that and you commit suicide but you can be a holy ghost Phil person all right so everybody with me on that but your adoption is not your birth your adoption is your placing now remember brother Ryan said when you're born again you're born of the spirit of God and you're sons of God but will your predestinated who was predestinated only this age was predestinated to come to full adoption hear ye him make your name on the checkbook just as good as God's he didn't give that to any other age a little bit in Paul's age a little bit in Irene is his age but remember it got lost down through the church ages well now it's going to be brought back brother round said brought back by the word of God is going to bring it back the full word of God so your adoption is your placing is not your birth but now listen you can't get adopted without having the new birth right right but you can't be anointed by different things you can be anointed by the Holy Ghost listen how can somebody stand here and preach the message an hour for 30 years and have a church with 350 400 people and turn around one day and deny this message he married him he buried him he baptized them all during that tenure now you tell me he's got the Holy Ghost I don't know I'll let God deal with that but it sure don't look like it talk to One preacher this coming last weekend and he said he said I just truly believe he blessed Fame the Holy Ghost I said well okay you can say that but I'm still going to pray for the brother I mean I'm still going to pray if there's a chance like this guess what with you there's a chance like this too all right amen all of us we need Grace now look we were predestinated unto adoptions so we're heading toward that we can do it other ages couldn't do it but we can do it because we have the word of God listen we have this is to me this is the this is the um I don't want to say that no I don't want to say that but this is not the image that the other ages had but that's the image that we have brother Branham I mean Paul Peter tells us every one of these add to your faith verse Universal knowledge and all those temperaments but it took a prophet to bring that thing together so that we can say that's a stature of a perfect man and it's connected with the pyramid because there's a headstone that was rejected there was a Cornerstone that started the message and all that it's not it's not just a pretty picture I was thinking just a little while ago this is not something that's just it's required it's not something to feel 121 times we got on on uh YouTube but we were predestinated somebody is going to preach us to adoption somebody is going to preach us to the body change somebody is going to have an anointing that won't come off that'll stay on us and we will not die and I mean laity too I'm not talking about just the preachers I'm talking about laity somebody is going to catch this thing foreign it's not me I'm not standing away from somebody that can lead follow get out of the way right so the River Jordan we know that that was a position when when Jesus Come On the River Jordan I'm kind of backgrounding for this weekend so I hope you remember between now and Sunday River Jordan experience a was a type remember need the Holy Ghost right he was born Lord to Christ he was born Emmanuel he didn't he wasn't born a regular man and then he walked around with a soul that wasn't God his soul was almighty God and His Spirit was a spirit that's 100 times in diverse manners that speak through the prophets or the Holy Spirit you got inside of you everybody with me all right then he had a human body but he had to go to the River Jordan to what to fulfill the Old Testament actually because remember the sacrifice when John said Behold the Lamb of God it takes away the sin of the world he was identifying there's the lamb and that lamb has got to be washed before it can be sacrificed so that's why I had to be baptized he had to be washed as a Sacrifice by a prophet or by somebody like Moses had to wash them get them ready but that wasn't here ye him because remember God spoke and there was this fluttering of look like a dove it wasn't a dub it looked like a dove it was it was something that floated down that John saw because he was a prophet John saw it with his own eyes in another dimension he saw it come on him and stay there and not lift off of him and we'll read that this coming Sunday but that was not here you him even God to to his own flesh person God Almighty human flesh he'd say here you him at that time because he had to grow in Grace and knowledge that's what the Bible says he was a human but now he did come to a time where there was a mount Transfiguration place that he had to come to to where now he said this is my beloved Son whom I'm pleased to dwell there was a cloud come down over them there was a cloud come down over him and said now here ye him six months before he went to Calvary but remember in Matthew 24 he preached the seal right before they took him to Calvary he couldn't preach those seals with that other anointing on him he preached the seals when he said here ye him just like brother Brown same way brother I'm had to come to the hear you him part so that we could get what we got from him so we've been talking about Moses and different ones they had we were talking about power without character so let's put this word in here power without the Holy Ghost in their soul because remember the holy ghost in your soul is your Rudder it's your spiritual um uh it's your spiritual Rudder it's what turns you when you start trying to do something wrong and it don't touch that doorknob on that car you said that wasn't the holy ghost that was just no I I wore or if you're led by the spirit of God you're the sons of God right now some of the dumb stuff we do I don't think that we can blame that on the Holy Ghost all right blame that on ourself not even the devil so Moses had power without the Holy Ghost and his soul so he could kill somebody he had a Killer Instinct hey I'm sorry he did David too David had a lot of spirit on him so did Samson Abraham lied a couple of times Jacob Noah we talked about it before Saul Elisha all the different ones they had power because God had anointed them to do a job all right so he would anoint Elisha and Elisha would do a job but that anointing stayed so close to Elisha that two things happened in Elisha's life number one was is he got mad when those kids were calling him old ball head and 42 kids died because of that prophet then Elisha died and he still had so much of the Holy Ghost in his bones so they throw the dead man down there and a dead man come to life all right let's don't try that but watch so that's anointed in the Old Testament Jesus come he was the Holy Ghost he was our example he was this but he had to be anointed for a Ministry something did come on him at the River Jordan and it stayed on him and the Bible said and remained all right so we'll talk about that Sunday I'm trying to get a little bit of basis so you can kind of get it rolled around in your head because listen the Holy Ghost is the most important thing in your life whether you got it or not you've got to know that you know that you know before you even start with these virtues but listen with the Holy Ghost you can catch up real quick because God said he wouldn't leave anybody behind if you make yourself available I promise you God will give it to you he'll pour it in if you just want it bad enough now notice in this now David thought he had everything in order now remember what brother Ryan was talking about remember David David was a prophet he was a man after God's Own Heart but he got a little he got a little self-righteous I said oh I'm bringing the art back this is wonderful I'm sitting in a message Church got the best popular preacher no I'm not going there but anyway so he he we don't have that here so how the Holy Spirit can anoint a man but he was inspired what happened instead of going by what God had said right that thing had to be carried by the preachers or the priests right he said oh put it on a cart I want to hear now don't I don't have time to send a priest that sounds good but brother Brown said he was out of the will of God and a man died because of David's inspired order that he wanted that thing back which it was the ark of God but he wasn't supposed to be touched by anybody said see how the Holy Spirit can anoint a man but it's got to be in the order of the anointing the outside Spirit can be annoying with the Holy Ghost and the Soul as dark as pitch false teachers can rise teaching all kinds of trinitarian ideas or whatever you want to call in the message now and be Anointed with the Holy Ghost and perform just as many miracles as the true gospel can but by the word here that's what does it that's why that brother Dale has harped on the word the word the word the word because if you don't get the word you can be fooled you can be fooled we're all food we'll have the word of God we're all fool without the truth raw food without the Holy Ghost in our soul Ephesians 4 verse 6 is one God and Father of all who is above all through all and in you all but unto every one of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ thank God wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high now what he when he ascended upon high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men that was Jesus when he resurrected come up through the Old Testament took Paradise up and took him up into a place all right they're by with me wherefore now you didn't stay there though wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now Paul stops and interpolates with the quotation or the exclamation not the exclamation but the parentheses now that he ascended what is it but they also descended into the lower parts of the earth so it first went down picked them up brought them out but now look he that descended is a sign one that ascended uh far above all Heavens that he might fill all things so where did he go he went to a dimension but he sent the Holy Ghost back how that red right there that's what he sent us he sent us Apostles Prophets evangelists pastors and teachers for what for the Perfection of the Saints for the edifying for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ look till we all come to the unity of faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God and to a perfect man statue of perfect man unto the measure of the Statue of the fullness of Christ that will help forth be more white no more children talks to and fro and carried away with every window Doctrine by the slight of man and cunning craftness where they lying way to deceive but speaking look the truth in love May grow up into him in All Things which is the head even Christ from which the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that whichever joint supplies compacted according to the effectual working and the measure of every part makeeth look increase we're flourishing because of what we believe or we're not or we're not but we should flourish it's like the sister up there I don't know if you watch the the YouTube video of me speaking up there but there was a sister sister Linda we known her since she's a little kid and um she told me she said well wait she said my kid you know she had a kid or two that was out in the world she said I've done everything she said I went through all and did everything I go to church I read my Bible I pray I do this I do that I pay my time I do all that she said God's got to honor my prayer and she's right because what will happen is that will trigger God to have to do something if we'll approach it like that if we'll approach it like that that God that God you've said this because brother Adam said look what you've done at when you've done everything you know do what do you say Do stand stand right there and say God you promised it don't worry about hell or high water you stand there and you claim your kids claim your healing claim yourself that you're going to grow in the Statue of perfect man amen I can't do it you gotta do it yourself but thank God he give us a Ministry that can do it now look at what edifying means the act of one who promotes another's growth isn't that what this this church is built on that brother Mo brother Dale all the Ministries that's been in this building it is an edifying Ministry it's not something to tear somebody down oh sure sometimes people have you know bro they don't have to get he had to get a little um you know do a little surgery a little loose skin you know but you know what we were better because of it we were better because of it all right and you can't say you weren't you say you were worse and you need to go back and get the new birth because remember God if you're if you don't take correction you're what Ambassador child all right so you're not even in the body you're not even my brother or sister I'm just telling you what the Bible says the act of one who promotes another's growth in Christian wisdom piety happiness and Holiness so edifying has to come through a five-fold Ministry not pressing play am I in the wrong Church can somebody say a man that's weak I believe in press and play but I believe you got to have a five-fold Ministry people in flesh standing here looking at you and telling you what God Said because look as brother Dale said many years ago and I caught that and I hope that a lot of other people did because somebody quoted not too long ago these gifts were predestinated by God these are gifts to the church all right they're gifts to the church he wasn't given to one man sure brother Brown did fulfill all but when he passed on he gave it to the rest of the people because you can't take Ephesians out now watch brother Ryan said for the Bible said it was Apostles prophets evangelist teachers pastors all of these for the perfecting of the church God set them in the church now look there's nine spiritual gifts all right love joy peace and speaking of tongues they can all be given out by Satan brother Brown said Satan can pass out spiritual gifts like you wouldn't believe now there's nine spiritual gifts but now look they're not predestinated you can have them not have them if I never speak in tongues a day of my life I'm still born again okay so you understand they're they're they're they're needed we need them we should have them the gifts working in the church right but if you never speak in tongues a day in your life don't think you're dying going to hell because you missed that gift because but that gift wasn't predestinated but let me tell you something you won't make it without Apostles prophets pastoral teachers and evangelists I'll promise you that because that's what the Bible says look God set them into church now there's nine spiritual gifts that we can lay on hands and so forth and pray earnestly for the best gifts and so forth period but these others are predestinated gifts of God sets them in the church now who's going to take them out man's took them out God never took them out there's nowhere where God took them away Through the Ages that come John the Baptist was a special runner for that age God forordained them to do that work do you believe that sure he did he said do you go to see a prophet he said more than a prophet John didn't know that but Jesus knew it now listen hear you him 1958 brother Ryan said look speak the word Lord and he's praying if that would be sufficient but God's good he has said in the church gifts first apostles or missionaries both the same Apostle means one sin missionary means one sin Apostles prophets teachers evangelist pastors they're all predestinated gifts of God in other words they cannot change gifts and callings are without repentance so any of those gifts can be misinterpreted can be used by Satan and listen even Apostle prophets pastors and evangelists can be false but there is a true group because they're predestinated to get us somewhere they're predestinated to edifice they're predestinated to get us to the next level if you want to say that they're placed in the church look so who placed them in God man didn't but man's tried to take them out man can't take out what God put in gifts and callings are without repentance they're placed in the church to bring the church together hold it together for the glory of God that's why you see listen folks there's going to come a time whenever everybody's going to do what show who they are going to let it out one way or the other we just need the gifts that God gave us okay God give us gifts through men God give us gifts through men God didn't come in one man he did Christ Jesus yes he did but what did he tell you he was going to do I'm going to go away I'm going to come back and what I've got I'm going to give to you all right so let's look here just for a second brotherly kindness I'm trying not to leave so much skin on the floor but but we know what brother kindness is and and truly look if you call somebody a brother or sister denotes you from the same family so you when you say brother so and so or sister so and so you really mean that you mean that they're part of the family the real family of God all right John 13 34 now Jesus is standing he says a new commandment I give you that you love one another as I have loved you that you also love one another by this y'all look buy this now how you want men to know you how were they known as disciples in the early church they were called Christians because they acted like Caiaphas no they acted like Christ they were Christians in Antioch the Bible says so he said you're going to see that men know that ye are my disciples if you have love one to another in other words an outward display Matthew 5 verse 37 said but let your conversation be yeah yeah for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil you have heard that it said now Jesus is Jesus talking you have heard that it's been said that thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate your enemy that's what the Old Testament said all right we moved over into a new commandment we didn't do away with the old commandment right because under the old commandment you hated your enemy because you didn't have the Holy Ghost you didn't have that kind of love in your heart God knew that so he put that in there so you know even if you murder somebody in the Old Testament and if you did it maliciously the family hunted you down and killed you but there was a refuge City there were six Refuge cities that if something happened even if even if you wanted to do it but there were some that if they even had an example that if an ax handled or an ax head falls off and hit somebody and kills them you can run in there to that City and find Refuge well praise God to us that in the New Testament that's Grace that's Grace because if you kill somebody's influence you've killed the brother right and that I've been guilty of that but you gotta make it right you have heard that's been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you all right I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you can you really do that can you really do that you think about that and I've been thinking about it all week do good to them that hate you literally hate you you got to do good to them for them no you know what we do we get it in the bed and we lay our head down and we go bless Mom and Dad bless our church folks bless our ministry Bless the people that love me bless my friends have you ever said bless my neighbor that hates me well there's the skin y'all like to walk over going out me too but that literally is what they're saying that's not saying anything different than what I just told you if somebody despises you you need to pray for them I'm just telling you you said well why do I need to waste my time altar will be open in just a few minutes pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you no we get into we got God right in my neighborhood right here I have to look at it when I'm watering the lawn and he hates me I'm praying for you ever done that before nope didn't think so more skin hit the floor but you know that's why and just like Jim said our our neighbors are homosexual and they've been that way for 30 years but they're some of the nicest people they show no outward affection when they're outside and they're just nice they've been they've even been the only one in their neighbor right around us that's asked about the message yeah and he's asked about Dad several times about dad and his you know having the stroke and all that because they almost died they both had hearts and heart attacks and they were widowmakers so God God kept around here for some reason but they know that we can talk back and forth and they give they converse with us but Mike come over one day and he said I've heard this about y'all all my life so see I mean the community knows well they think they know what ain't so-and-so said that Uncle so-and-so said that that cousin this one said and and and and and then the the preacher on the other Church said he said I just want to know what y'all believe ear to ear mouth to mouth I want you I want to know what y'all believe so I sit through it outside and we stood there for about an hour and I kind of just laid the picture out for a little bit you know and he said well okay never rejected it never said anything up and he said well I just wondered I've heard this and I've heard y'all worship a man and y'all say that he's God and nip so I just kind of you know give him the uh um you know the whole spell about the message and how we believe that a messenger had to come and was identified in the Bible it's not just somebody God said I'm just going to send this guy I know he's identifying the scripture so Mike was enough to know he'd been raised in church he knew those scriptures and where they were Malachi was not you know he knew where Malachi was in the Bible so what are you saying well you know what maybe it'll do something planted maybe a little something in them you know same way with the guy that I saw the other day you just you just you know if he but now if he would have said well now I heard you was a uh you um stole something and you didn't you know he starts naming all this stuff and and you know I heard you cussing the other day over there you know and that would have been a real good example right so let's not be guilty of that I want to be guilty of being a Christian and as the old saying goes if I have to go to court will they convict me to be one by the evidence that's given I won't be able to convict me as a father hath loved me so have I loved you continue in my love if you keep my Commandments you shall abide in my love now he's fixing to tell us what's the two greatest Commandments not Thou shalt not kill not Thou shalt not bear false witness not there shall honor your father and mother which is good he's going to tell us what the two great Commandments are because they're going to ask him here in just a little bit this is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved you Divine love and Sovereign Grace brother mom said we're facing a day when brotherly love will become a strange thing among people and it's to my humble belief that that's the greatest of all the gifts that there is in God's Bible remember the whole quote I didn't bring it but for those of you that hadn't heard it he he said now if if God was to walk up to me and say all right I'm going to give you the greatest Ministry and we'll give you the greatest healing campaign I'm going to give you all these great things but I'm gonna withhold my love from you brother Brown said take all of them and give me love just give me that one gift and that's what he's saying here to my humble belief and I believe that that's why we're not as far up as we are is brotherly kindness is showing somebody that literally hates your guts that it's all right I'm not gonna what did the Bible say if you're reviled at don't revile back guilty yeah thank you Richard uh some of you'll tell the truth some of you Liars so selfish to be selfish is to be concerned excessively with your own self IE sticks selfishness is one of the biggest obstacles to having the kind of close relationship with God and an inspiring relationship with other how can you be selfish how can you be so selfish that you don't help your brother or your sister I keep saying brotherly kindness it is sisterly also y'all don't stand here all you women are going you know me and it says brotherly kindness no kindness slash okay so now see y'all all involved now the women was like he's talking about them now that's in Brothers second Timothy 3 verse 2 said for men shall be lovers of their own selves boy think about that Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents Unfaithful Unholy have you ever seen a world where where you see these YouTube influencers don't have a job huh you kids your kids know what I'm talking about the other ones may not there's people that just get paid to just say I'm going to the bathroom today I'm gonna color my hair blue and I'm gonna wear this and I'm gonna go lay on the beach I'm gonna Vlog or blog or whatever it is and I get paid to do that wow think about yourself but are we that way are we selfish brother Brown said in 1950 people's got too selfish get to a place where they think they live in a little world all by theirself oh what was me you know that's the truth now brother Brown says I despise that somebody that's that old somebody that feels they're bigger than somebody else after all you're six foot of Earth that's all you are well some more scan just hit the ground and brother Brown says in 1954 said I recognized the other day a selfish Spirit coming on me I'm saying this man's wrong I know I ought to tell him about it that's wrong God's one needs to tell him about it let's continue on same listen brother Brown was full of complexes I'm just trying to tell you this man was human this is the same tape this is the same message on down a little bit further in a different paragraph he said I want to ask the church one more thing before we get some place to study in Scripture that you'll pray for me I've developed a critical spirit and it haunts me wow but you know what I believe he got rid of it he comes to Statue of perfect man he got rid of it but at least he realized he had it so he could get rid of it right we got to realize that we're at a place so we can get rid of certain things and to me that's what the preaching is it dissects your life for you because we don't want to believe that we're wrong I ain't going there everlasting life brother Brown said that's what's the matter with people today now listen they're trying to pack up to be a Christian if there's anything you need to do is unpack to be a Christian got too many things hanging on and he keeps telling you that you load the camel up so much so it's bowlegged so that's what we need to quit doing and and brother Bob I got to keep this in here brother Bob talks about pride and Buddy when he talks about Pride that blanket of evil just went out across over the congregation foreign listen it's okay to be proud I'm proud of my dad proud of my mom I'm proud of my pastor that's one thing to be proud of but I'm not so pride-ish to say he's the only one that's got it and to say that there's me foreign no more that's too much pride a feeling of deep pleasure derived from your own achievements look at me I did this I did this no if anything happens good God had something to do with it if it's in your Christian life I want y'all to realize that the achievement of those who with whom is closely associated are from quality or possessions that are widely admired so see I'm proud to be I used to be proud to be an American when I was you know back in the world because that's all I knew but now I'm proud to be a Christian but I am proud to be living here I mean I don't want to be living nowhere else all right as bad as it is so the Bible tells us Pride goeth Before Destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall holy spirit means arrogancy or bad sense I just want everybody to see that that that still is it plagues all of us it really does it the price do you just think about it like brother Bob was saying you know what's all this gay movement Pride I'm proud of what I am well guess what I'm proud of what I am I like the whole world and I'll Hold the Flag up I don't care if it's all different colors to me it's a sign God ain't gonna destroy the world with water no more he's going to destroy it with fire but he's not going to destroy the water no more because he'd give me a rainbow that I can look at and I don't look at the rainbow to see gay people maybe took off on YouTube that's whatever we got to stand up for what we are all right okay Blasphemous names brother Robin now look real quick brother Brian tells us he sees this dream of sister Shepard so he's interpreting the dream now being a prophet he saw the dream so he's not interpreting from from her telling him thank God for a prophecy because you know you if I tell brother boy in my dream and he tells sister James brother Bob something don't get missing in between there but when brother Brandon was standing he would literally see the same dream that you had he could be confident that he didn't miss anything so he would be kind and God let him do that so he could have that confidence that he didn't miss anything and you could depend on sister Shepard was saying brother random or she was saying God do I have the Holy Ghost remember so God was so gracious that he gave her a dream and then gave brother around the same dream to tell her the interpretation and here's that interpretation and it has something to do with the Statue of perfect man because remember Blasphemous names was preached the Sunday after he preached at you a perfect man and he does clarify a lot of things in Blasphemous names that he didn't clarify in the Statue of perfect man read them both and you'll see that so brother Ram talks about he sees the vision of this man is up on top of the pyramid pouring water in so this Tabernacle he's talking about is not a holy ghost Tabernacle there's no such thing individuals that come into this church as Holy Ghost Tabernacles now see he's he's making this I can see where he's he's telling sister Shepard look it's not the Tabernacle that you're going to that may shoes have the Holy Ghost I don't want you to depend on you having the Holy Ghost by coming to this church all right he's saying you depend on the Holy Ghost that's inside of you because brother Ram says look they are Tabernacles that contain the Holy Ghost me and you so he's telling sister Shepard it's got to not be in a in a building but it's got to be inside of you but not the church in the body a group therefore it runs out he's done with the water but what this man who was pouring the water the messenger of the church who was that he saw himself he just was so humble he didn't say that was me bless God I was up there pouring that water in there no he said it was a messenger to the church well you and I catch that Revelation that it was him doing that pouring the message into the church but what was the water doing it was boiling out all the trash so he's telling sister Shepard you got the Holy Ghost all these things are in the right position but they steal some trash there's still some excess skin that we got to get rid of right there's still some brotherly kindness that we got to work on Temperance patients and all these different things it was boiling out all the trash that was in it so I can I can see I can't see the dream but I can see I can stand back and see that there was a pyramid-shaped mountain and the top was off of it and here this box was sitting because I can see it there here's that box was sitting there and she said brother around do I have a holy ghost yeah you got the Holy Ghost but there's more there's more I got to get this trash out of you because remember she was standing not at the top of the pyramid sister Shepard was standing at the bottom of the pyramid with the water running over her feet okay sister Shepard you got the Holy Ghost but you ain't up there where that man's at but you can get there if you'll let us if you'll let the message of the hour boil all this trash out of you same way with us it's what the Holy Spirit does it boils it up now now the honey represented Brotherly Love brotherly kindness which is this age I just got through telling said brotherly kind of see something about the message before the week before the agent we live in now now you might say look I sure don't like brother Neville or I sure don't like brother Jones I don't like brother so and so something like that but just let something happen to him brother your heart is broke I was telling them up there um this past weekend how many times have you ever in your life how many times have you ever had a situation like that where you you got separated you didn't talk to somebody because of some little silly something everybody quiet and you don't see that person and you say boy I should call I'm gonna pick the phone up and I'm gonna call sister so and so I'm gonna call brother so and so and you find out two days later they're dead happened to me I know what's happened to you guys right what don't you just tear your heart out you don't worry separated you but you didn't want that to happen no more but you didn't worry about that you was worried about that person look now this is what brother I'm saying I want I want you to really get this because it's in big letters we can obtain brotherly kindness and feeling for one another all right for one another because I can conquer as an individual what I have against brother Boyd or him against me right but can every one of you in this building do the same thing at the same time but to maintain in the group of people he kind of lets that trail off because he wants you to think but you know what he's trying to do he's trying to get a church built to where it's not just an individual sure we grow as individuals absolutely but we got to come to a place where the bride has got to come to a place amen as a body it didn't say for the Perfection of two or three except for the Perfection of the Saints he said brother mom said but now to maintain it in a group of people it's going to be kind of hard because look he keeps going on why do you care for that brother because you broke bread with him here at the altar or you will tonight you fellowship with him oh by the way that made me realize again since last Wednesday we're not going to help communion this Sunday but we'll have it next Sunday be the first Sunday of the month brother Keith will be here so we'll just have everything that whole weekend you shook his hand you worshiped with him he's your brother and he might do something in the flesh now look that he would you would disagree with because you just kind of stay now look what you want to do but you shun him a little oh y'all never done that but in the more skin but in the bottom of your heart if something happened to that brother it would nearly kill you are that sister I'm an old man I once young now I'm old I've seen it down Through the Ages hear people say I just won't have no more to do with him and something happened that man that nearly kills you he thinks oh God I let my precious brother go without making friends with him you see see it's brotherly love it looks like it won't stick but it does stick the honey sticks what is the honey brotherly kindness brotherly kindness it will stick what is it holding together it's holding together that rock Box confession he was talking about that that what the messenger was pouring in because listen if you pour something into a box I don't care how how good the box is if it's got holes in it and if it's got cracks in it that trash is not going to come out that trash is gonna go right down to them holes and go right back into that same place again because remember where was the Box the box was sitting right here he was pouring the water in the trash was coming out and running down the side if you got holes in your box and don't have any brotherly kindness where's all that trash going to go right back down in the bottom Hebrews 12 but we all look like we've been in the sun all day and we get done with this one our skin follow peace with all men and Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord now look at that one looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God lest any root of bitterness spring up troubling you and thereby many be defiled now let's cover this and then we're not going to get any further but we'll get we'll get to the Holy Ghost this weekend acts 11 verse 22 now watch this is two men now there's no doubt Paul had the Holy Ghost he was a church-aged messenger he had some of those virtues working in his life because him and Peter had talked back and forth and he was a church age messenger he wasn't just some novice that was sitting there sucking his thumb no he wrote 80 of the New Testament all right and then Barnabas was connected to him and then it will let's read then Tidings of these things came into the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem and they sent forth Barnabas that he should go as far as Antioch who when he came and had seen the grace of God was glad and exhorted them all that with the purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord look for he was a good man and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith all right so the Bible is is is given the commentary of Barnabas that he wasn't some novice he wasn't some fly-by-night guy he had the Holy Ghost and faith and he was a good man and much people was added unto the Lord then departed Barnabas to Tarsus for deceit Saul in other words they come together and they preached for several years together everybody with me and when he had found him he brought him unto Antioch and it came to pass it a whole year they assembled right there they assembled them they were in the same church together breaking bread preaching getting something off each other right feeding off each other and they taught much people and the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch but now that was Acts 11 verse 22. now look acts 15 this is a few more verses over acts 15 36. and some days after Paul said after some days after and some days after Paul said unto Barnabas let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord and see how they do and Barnabas said okay but I'm going to take Mark with me or John but Paul thought not good to take him with him who departed from them from pampolia and went not with them to work to to the work and the contention was so sharp between them now listen it wasn't doctrinal wasn't Doctrine it was individual people that didn't see eye to eye with each other all right the contention was so sharp between them that they Departed the Sun or one from the other and it does not record them ever coming back together again and so Barnabas took Mark and sailed into Cyprus and Paul chose Silas now that Paul and Silas had to come together because they were they were they were written in the Bible that they did some great things had both be put in jail and departed being recommended by the Brethren unto the grace of God now think about that here's two men that are just Mighty Men in the same church and they have a little differences of who needs to go with them and who doesn't Paul was saying hey look Barnabas Mark wasn't with us when we were doing the work he just comes a little bit later and Barnabas is like yeah but he's my guy and Paul said well I ain't going with him Barnacle says we'll hang on with you so they Departed so you understand how brotherly kindness works they loved each other as brothers but they had small contentions with each other so as I've always said before if everybody loves you there's just something you're just too wishy-washy if everybody loves you now you should all love each other as brothers because we are Christians but just because Donnie doesn't hunt or or Dutton fish like I do okay I mean like I do all the time you'd rather have your head under a hood you had used to okay would you just go with me here okay I chose you for a reason um but now that doesn't make that what that does mean though that if Donnie says hey I'm going to I'm going to go rebuild don't laugh I'm gonna go rebuild a motor I'm gonna like go ahead buddy well why ain't you gonna go with me to rebuild this motor I don't want to I don't know a thing about it I'd be bored stiff I'm going hunting you go do your motor we'll come together on church Sunday so there's brother kindness just in a nutshell because there's got to be a balance because I'm gonna read you a scripture here in just a second where the Bible says whoa unto you that every man speaks good of you I'll read it right here I like this quote brother Brown's a real believer will give you your choice no selfishness in a real believer not at all and that's the great commandment somebody asked him said look which is a great Commandments in the law the great commandment in the law Jesus said Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all the heart and soul and mind and this is the first and great commandment and the second is like unto Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself on these two Commandments hang all the law and the prophets here it is Luke 6 verse 26 this is Jesus telling us woe unto you when all men speak well of you I'm just telling you what Jesus said for so did their fathers to the false prophets but I say unto you which here love your enemies do good to them which hate you bless them that curse you and pray for them which despitefully use you like I said before you get spotted you have a bad day at work your boss gets on you your neighbor gets on your your co-worker and and I'll promise you you don't go home and pray for them you might pray the Lord get them out of the office but the Bible says pray for those who despitefully use you and this is sound so simple or profound but we're not going to get up The Headstone if we don't love our brothers and our sisters like we should love your enemies do good to them that hate you listen I made myself a note here this is all hard for a human being without the Holy Ghost is totally impossible you look at the world road rage they'll shoot you now they used to just shoot me a bird now they shoot you with a gun all right anything you make somebody mad and they'll just they'll either beat you up run you off the road or they'll try to kill you and you see how this age you see where that guy lined his three kids up young kids and executing them and was laughing when he went to to the to the jail yeah killed his own three kids execution style they said and he had no remorse whatsoever you think that's bad you wait till we leave when we leave this place you can forget it you stay here you're gonna fight you'll fight till you die because everybody else is going to be doing the same thing but let's not let's get out of here love your neighbors do good to them once hate you bless them that curse you and pray for them which despitefully use you are falsely accuse you but love you your enemies and do good and lend hoping for nothing again and your rewards shall be great and you shall be the children of the highest for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil first John 4 19 says we loved him because he first loved us if a man say I love God and hate us his brother he's a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he has seen how can he love God whom he has not seen and this commandment have we from him that he who loveth God loveth his brother also First John 3 verse 13 says Marvel not my brethren if the world hates you boy we know that we know that we have passed from death into life because we love the brethren we know I'm reading your Bible I'm not reading you a quote from James Dobson I'm not reading a quote from Wade Dale or Samuel Dale I'm reading you the Bible there aren't we supposed to do what the Bible says the Bible was written for us right we know that we have passed from death into life because we love the Brethren he that loveth not his brother abideth in death whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer and you know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him I'm reading Bible okay hereby perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay our lives down for the Brethren but whoso had this world's good and see if his brother have need and shoth up his bowels of compassion from him how dwelleth the love of God in him my little children let us not love in the word neither in tongue now look but indeed and in truth easy to say it hard to do it but we can listen we can brother Brown tells us is you people these saw blade tempers that's always spouting off at the mouth at somebody if I hit anybody yet can't put more skin can't put up and things like that be careful brother I said be careful you're guilty if you speak a word against your brother that's not right not just go around and tear him down or town tear down it you don't have to stick a knife in that man's back to kill him you can break his character and kill him kill his influence how many times have we seen that we sure have speak against your pastor here tell me I'm sure he pointed back to brother Neville say something bad about him you just might as well have shot him told something that wasn't right about him well it'll kill his influence with the people and things like that and you're guilty of it that's what Jesus said how about that finally let's read this and then we'll magicians come on First Peter 3 verse 8 says finally be all of One mind having compassion one of another and I want to tell you a little story just for a second let's all stand I have a guy on my mail route and he's about to maybe the 10th box on the route so I get him early in the morning and and bless his heart I'm going to tell you this story and and then you know and I do pray for him but he lives in a he drives a car that I wouldn't drive out of my parking lot the wheels are bent the tailgates off the truck it's piled full of stuff but every day I'm telling you every day that boy is up out of the bed he's either trimming trees or cutting trees to make some money he's either hot he's got he goes and gets junk cars and stuff you know um takes it up here to them recycling thing cans and all that he works so hard and he has nothing lives in just a I mean you can look through the door and see the house and it's just powerful of stuff the yard's pile full of stuff but I have compassion on somebody that'll do that I don't have compassion on somebody who sits on their laser rear end and then that happens to them but when he just struggles all the time every time I see him he's doing something he's not sitting down he's always you know he seemed driving up the road with a trailer and he's got you know uh 14 or 15 parts that are aluminum or brass or something you know piled up on his on a junk and he's going to go and make maybe 50 bucks for all that effort finally be all in one mind having compassion one of another love is Brethren be pitiful be courteous not rendering evil for evil or railing for railing but contrary wise opposite r as brother Ram says Vice Versi or versa blessings but contrary wise don't render evil for evil or railing for William we're all we're we're all guilty of that but contrary wise blessings knowing that you are there unto call now look this is my whole point your call for this this is what you're called to there's a lot of people are not called to this because they can't they can't make it they're not taught they don't know how to navigate through scripture they don't know how to navigate through through times in their life because they don't have the Holy Ghost but if you got the Holy Ghost and you got good teaching this ought to be something that we that we conform as the Bible says conform to his image all right that's what we're doing with this we're we're taking our image out we're conforming to the image of God we're supposed to be doing so contrary wise blessings knowing that you are there unto called that you should inherit a blessing now who wants to blessing from God everybody says I need a blessing I need a blessing well there's your scripture right there have compassion one another love is Brethren be pitiful be courteous not rendering evil for evil or in other words the Bible says he didn't rail back when somebody railed at him when they was getting ready to hang him on the cross they called him all kind of stuff and he didn't say a word knowing that you're called for this and that you should inherit a blessing for he that will love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no God you love the Lord he's laid it out for us he's given us everything but are we doing are we as I was thinking the other day sometimes we just kind of skim over our Christianity we just kind of Hit the high points listen our Christianity we just kind of Hit the high points listen we love Acts 2 38. we love John 3 16. we love our certain scriptures repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ right we love these scripture you need to love them so we're esteeming one scripture better than the other Bible says when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses folks that's Divine forgiveness you and I can forgive but we can't forget because we're humans I wish we could but God can forgive and he can forget if you place it under the blood he can't even see it the prophet of God told us right let's sing a song so much to thank him for this evening when I look around and I see a good thing that is done for me [Music]
