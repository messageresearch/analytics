[24:43] lord
[24:44] hey man let's bow our heads before we

[24:47] today lord that
[24:49] as
[24:50] we were back there in the back and
[24:53] old brother bob come upstairs with
[24:55] tears in his eyes and
[24:57] a smile on his face and said the lord
[25:00] came down in the sunday school class
[25:02] this morning
[25:03] and blessed somebody
[25:05] so i hugged him and wanted some of that
[25:07] on me
[25:09] so i pray that it will
[25:12] help each and every one of us
[25:15] as we believe in your anointing father
[25:17] we believe in the holy spirit but we
[25:19] also believe in
[25:20] adding on a little
[25:22] add to your faith because the prophet of
[25:24] god said faith won't do it alone it
[25:25] takes all these virtues to make a
[25:28] perfect man
[25:29] father forgive us of our sins and our
[25:30] many mistakes that we make against you
[25:32] lord we commit them all to you please be
[25:35] the active participant in this service
[25:37] not a bystander lord
[25:39] a recording of our thoughts and ideas
[25:40] because most of the time they're wrong
[25:42] father but we pray today that we would
[25:44] focus our attention solely on you lord
[25:47] get away from the man and listen to the
[25:49] voice father because in the days of the
[25:51] voice of the seventh angel when he
[25:53] begins to sound this mystery
[25:55] this christ in you the hope of glory
[25:58] will be finished we pray that you'd be
[26:00] with the sick ones that are among us and
[26:01] the ones that are not here lord
[26:03] thanks for bringing the ones back that
[26:05] have been sick
[26:06] we actually continue to bless us anoint
[26:08] us with that healing anointing
[26:10] the healing anointing power that's still
[26:13] in your word father
[26:14] it's never diminished
[26:16] just bless us now lord take care of us
[26:18] take care of us in jesus name
[26:20] amen
[26:22] ii peter 1
[26:23] verse 1. it's wonderful to see somebody
[26:25] walk upstairs crying like a baby and
[26:27] saying boy the spirit of the lord fail
[26:29] that's good
[26:30] that's that's a good start to a good any
[26:32] service
[26:34] simon peter and the servant apostle
[26:35] jesus christ to them that have obtained
[26:37] like precious faith such to a group of
[26:39] people
[26:40] that have obtained like precious faith
[26:42] with us through the righteousness of god
[26:44] and our savior jesus christ grace and
[26:46] peace be multiplied unto you through the
[26:48] knowledge of god
[26:49] and of jesus our lord
[26:51] according as his divine power
[26:54] not man's power not your thoughts but
[26:56] the divine power have given unto us all
[26:59] things that pertain us unto life and
[27:00] godliness through the knowledge of him
[27:02] that called us to glory and virtue
[27:04] whereby are given so they're gifts unto
[27:07] us exceeding great and precious promises
[27:09] that by these the prophet said these
[27:11] promises see these promises you might be
[27:13] partakers of the divine nature having
[27:15] escaped the corruption that is in the
[27:18] world
[27:18] through lust and that's not just that's
[27:21] a lot of other things we're going to
[27:22] talk about today uh that word lust uh we
[27:26] may get into a little bit but it's not
[27:27] just only
[27:29] uh beastly lust it's lust for all a lot
[27:31] of things
[27:32] you know when we see that word lush we
[27:34] think well it's a you know it's a sexual
[27:36] thing but it's really not
[27:37] you can have lush for a lot of things
[27:39] right all right and besides this giving
[27:41] all diligence beside this in other words
[27:43] besides adding this divine nature
[27:46] beside this giving all diligence add to
[27:48] your faith
[27:49] not somebody else's not the pastor's
[27:51] faith not your wife's faith not the
[27:53] faith of your neighbor your faith so
[27:55] this is personal add to your faith
[27:59] virtue
[28:00] to virtue knowledge and all his
[28:02] temperance the temperance patience
[28:03] patience godliness and the godliness
[28:05] brotherly kindness and the brother
[28:07] kindness charity for if there's that
[28:10] word if you have to decide if these
[28:12] things be in you and abound
[28:14] they make you that you shall neither be
[28:15] barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
[28:17] of our lord jesus christ the reason
[28:19] we're bearing or not bearing fruit is
[28:22] that right there right if these things
[28:23] be in you in the bound they make you
[28:26] but verse nine but he that lacketh these
[28:28] things is blind
[28:30] and cannot see afar off and has
[28:32] forgotten that he was purged from his
[28:34] old sins that's what i'm trying to stir
[28:36] up today
[28:39] that lack of these things is blind and
[28:41] can't see it far off we might think
[28:42] we're way up here in the top of the
[28:43] pyramid but if if you don't live them
[28:46] and people don't see them i don't care
[28:48] what comes out of your mouth right hey
[28:51] man it doesn't matter to me anymore what
[28:53] comes out of somebody's mouth we got to
[28:55] live at life
[28:56] wherefore the rather brethren give
[28:58] diligence
[29:00] to make your calling in election sure
[29:02] for if ye do these things ye shall never
[29:06] fall you may be seated in the lord as
[29:07] blessing to the reading of the word you
[29:09] shall never what a promise you shall
[29:11] never fall
[29:13] you say oh we fall all the time no we
[29:15] backslide it's like william brother
[29:17] william said he said some of us you know
[29:18] back sliding is slow some people just
[29:21] fall off the cliff
[29:22] all right that's not backsliding back
[29:24] sliding is backing up slow
[29:26] are just staying in the same place
[29:28] so now let's see let's pull the pyramid
[29:30] back up here and uh the chart
[29:33] and we're going to go through and just
[29:34] background just for a few minutes
[29:36] because i i enjoy background in a little
[29:38] bit even for us it's been here the whole
[29:40] time we still need the background a
[29:41] little bit
[29:42] all right
[29:43] so remember this is the center piece of
[29:45] the message to me it hinges on whether
[29:48] you get the body whether you take a body
[29:50] change and be alive or whether you have
[29:51] to die and go by the grave this is the
[29:53] hinge point the the center piece now
[29:55] whether you believe it or not this age
[29:57] requires you to have this before
[30:01] you take a body change
[30:03] and not die
[30:04] all right so there's life and death has
[30:07] been presented to you just like moses
[30:08] said moses comes over and he said life
[30:10] and death has been presented to you well
[30:12] today life and death is being presented
[30:14] to you if you're not a believer you're
[30:16] not going to believe it that makes you
[30:17] an unbeliever but if you're a believer
[30:20] then believing these things as we were
[30:22] talking about believing these things
[30:24] actually believing gives you a desire
[30:27] it gives you a desire if you believe
[30:29] that god's going to do this for you you
[30:31] got to have a desire
[30:33] because if you don't then if you lack
[30:35] these things you're blind
[30:37] what blind not physically blind
[30:39] spiritually you don't have a revelation
[30:41] mama why are you doing something over
[30:42] there
[30:46] i looked over and saw an empty nest
[30:51] good to see uh
[30:54] good to see tommy and brother ernest
[30:56] with us
[30:57] today
[30:58] but uh i lost you there for a minute i
[31:00] have to figure i'd see if mama's there
[31:01] so when everything's all right
[31:04] ain't nothing like that mama nod
[31:07] nothing like it if you sit there and do
[31:08] like this you better go crawl under a
[31:10] bench somewhere
[31:14] brother brown said the mother knows
[31:16] right the mother's the one that knows
[31:18] she's the one that knows how you act and
[31:20] that you know she knows how you are
[31:22] can't fool a mama
[31:24] hey man can't fool the mama
[31:28] and sister trudy yeah nyla you go over
[31:30] there and just check your head uh-huh yo
[31:32] she was like shaking her head looking at
[31:34] her mama so she knows can't get away
[31:36] from that but it's got to be a desire
[31:38] because each one of these virtues sure
[31:40] we got the holy ghost down here at faith
[31:42] faith equals the new birth equal to the
[31:44] holy ghost all right but we must have
[31:46] brother brian remember he said faith
[31:48] alone won't do it
[31:50] now faith will get you in the body faith
[31:52] will get you into the new birth where
[31:54] you can
[31:55] be in the family of god and you get all
[31:57] the you get all the benefits of being in
[31:59] the family but getting the benefits and
[32:02] using them are two different things
[32:04] right
[32:05] you can go to the reading of the will
[32:08] which that's what we're doing today you
[32:09] can go to the reading of the well but
[32:11] you can say no i don't want that i don't
[32:12] want that it sure you can you can say i
[32:15] don't want that give it to somebody else
[32:16] well that's what these virtues are these
[32:18] virtues are promises or gifts
[32:21] that god has given us put in the church
[32:24] for us to what become a perfect man
[32:28] right
[32:28] now look
[32:30] your soul is already perfect getting
[32:32] your birth
[32:33] right your soul is already perfect got
[32:35] the new birth all right but you have to
[32:37] grow in grace and knowledge in this guy
[32:40] this guy's got to grow because the holy
[32:42] ghost never had to grow
[32:44] it he is what it is
[32:46] he's the great i am he's the one that
[32:48] knows everything and that's the problem
[32:49] with us
[32:50] i say us all of us is the reason we've
[32:53] been here still for 50 years since the
[32:54] prophet left because we haven't realized
[32:57] what we got when we got the holy ghost
[33:00] it took a prophet of god to bring us to
[33:02] a level to really understand what the
[33:05] new birth was all right
[33:08] that it was all these virtues
[33:11] working in your life not just being
[33:13] there because jesus all these virtues
[33:15] was in him and working amen all right
[33:19] he walked brother brown said in the
[33:21] world of perfect faith
[33:22] right he walked in a world of perfect
[33:24] faith and obviously he had virtue we
[33:26] read it the other day how virtue went
[33:28] from him
[33:29] sure he had so much knowledge he
[33:30] confounded the scholars
[33:32] uh temperance uh he should have got a
[33:35] lot more mad than he did
[33:41] old fools and slow of heart now what if
[33:42] i told you all that
[33:44] you know
[33:45] you know i heard a brother the other day
[33:47] saying that jesus was
[33:48] was a mild man or guy well
[33:52] no he wasn't
[33:54] he was and he had compassion for
[33:57] everybody but when he come to that
[33:59] because you always have problems with
[34:00] the religious people he didn't have
[34:02] problems with the drunks he didn't have
[34:04] problems with the prostitutes he had
[34:06] problems with the religious people right
[34:09] with the religious people and he would
[34:11] say hey
[34:13] you got a different daddy than me
[34:16] and they perceived
[34:18] what he was talking about finally and
[34:19] they got mad at him and they wanted to
[34:20] stone him
[34:21] so that's the same way it's going to be
[34:23] it's going to be the religious people
[34:24] that's going to push us
[34:26] not the sinners the sinners really don't
[34:28] care
[34:29] really they don't i mean if they're
[34:30] unbelievers they're just unbelievers i
[34:32] mean you know if you what you got to
[34:33] have is you got to have that virtue to
[34:35] draw them in right all right you got to
[34:37] have virtue temperance and obviously
[34:40] jesus had patience he was god so he
[34:42] presented godliness brotherly kindness
[34:44] and then absolutely he was the most
[34:46] loved that ever was given because he
[34:47] gave his life when he didn't have to he
[34:50] gave his life
[34:51] for everybody
[34:53] not just
[34:54] his chosen he gave his life for
[34:56] everybody so
[34:57] this is actually a
[34:59] a study on the new birth but it's also a
[35:02] study on how to act once you get the new
[35:04] birth right all right so i just want a
[35:06] kind of background for some that hadn't
[35:07] been here in a little bit and these are
[35:09] all overcomings you are not going to i
[35:11] told
[35:12] i told my cousin the other day and he
[35:14] kind of liked it
[35:16] we met with
[35:18] terry dale
[35:19] he's letting us borrow a part of his
[35:22] warehouse to use for our beekeeping
[35:25] adventure so
[35:26] we were talking about all these things
[35:28] and i said yeah i said he said it's been
[35:30] a rough week i said yeah we didn't we
[35:31] weren't called with spoons and forks
[35:34] we weren't called to a picnic
[35:36] we were called to a battle with swords
[35:38] and shields and he liked that because he
[35:39] probably never heard that before but but
[35:41] that's it it's true this is not a picnic
[35:44] to overcome means you gotta overcome who
[35:47] first you
[35:49] all right then you gotta overcome all
[35:50] the adversity that goes around you and
[35:53] remember you must suffer the rain
[35:56] right suffer the rain
[35:59] but and power without character see you
[36:01] can have power
[36:04] you shall receive power we'll read it a
[36:06] minute once the holy ghost comes all
[36:08] right you receive power but how you use
[36:10] it
[36:11] is either going to be a stumbling block
[36:13] to the unbeliever
[36:15] or even satanic to the nature that
[36:17] you'll use it wrong
[36:18] all right
[36:21] that's the truth
[36:23] that's the truth anyhow whether you
[36:24] believe it or not all right now and also
[36:26] like we were talking about
[36:28] all these
[36:31] are nice that's a pretty drawing but how
[36:33] do we get them go to ephesians 4
[36:36] we'll cut it down real short because
[36:37] we've read it already but ephesians 4
[36:40] this is peter telling us what we need
[36:42] but it's going to be ephesians 4 that
[36:45] paul picks up
[36:47] and brother dale and i were talking
[36:48] going to pick up police the other day
[36:50] you know honestly the point that i made
[36:52] was who's writing this
[36:55] who's writing this paul
[36:58] paul right the holy ghost but paul's
[36:59] writing this
[37:01] he didn't get it
[37:03] from the ephesians that's right sure he
[37:06] got it from god but where did he get the
[37:08] virtues from right
[37:11] old testament
[37:13] he pulled them by the holy ghost the
[37:15] filter pulled it out of that old
[37:17] testament that's all paul had he didn't
[37:19] have a bible right he didn't have a
[37:22] quote book he was making the quote book
[37:25] amen so he pulled it out of the old
[37:27] testament i wished i had time because
[37:28] then it began i began thinking about all
[37:31] the things that happened in the old
[37:32] testament that could bring out virtue
[37:33] knowledge temperance because that's all
[37:35] paul had now he may have heard peter
[37:37] preach about it he may have
[37:40] but what if he didn't because remember
[37:42] paul spent time out here and peter was
[37:44] over here and when they come together
[37:45] the prophet of god said they were
[37:46] preaching the same thing amen all right
[37:48] so paul pulls it out of the old
[37:50] testament
[37:51] this right here he gave some apostles
[37:54] prophets evangelists and pastors and
[37:55] teachers for the perfecting of the
[37:57] saints so you can't get it any other way
[37:59] before the perfecting of the saints the
[38:01] work of the ministry edifying of the
[38:03] body of christ teal
[38:05] so in other words we do have a journey
[38:06] till
[38:07] we come to the unity of the faith the
[38:09] knowledge of the son of god unto a
[38:11] perfect man unto the measure of the
[38:13] stature of the fullness of christ all
[38:16] right so that's how we get it and look
[38:18] hebrews 5 14.
[38:20] let's just run through these scriptures
[38:21] again
[38:22] but strong meat belonging to them
[38:24] they're of full age
[38:26] i see babies do
[38:28] babies have a characteristic
[38:31] right right
[38:33] but adults have another characteristic
[38:35] okay it's not that they do away with
[38:37] them they take what they had
[38:39] and they what by reason of use
[38:43] see a 14 year old kid says i can drive
[38:46] that car
[38:49] no exercising
[38:51] right he's got a practice
[38:54] heard the old addis practice what you
[38:56] preach well you got to practice
[38:58] says even those who by reason of use
[39:01] have their senses exercised to discern
[39:04] and that's what we come into knowledge
[39:06] is discernment between good and evil all
[39:09] right so strong meat belongs to them
[39:10] they're full age
[39:12] now everybody's not at full age but at
[39:14] least if you get yourself under the
[39:16] fountain
[39:18] of a full-aged minister
[39:21] amen
[39:22] because if he still if a preacher is
[39:23] still a baby you're not going to grow
[39:27] if a preacher is a baby because you
[39:28] can't go in a higher power if he's
[39:30] preaching baby that's okay but everybody
[39:33] must continue up that ladder right
[39:37] even the preachers amen
[39:39] all right now let's go to hebrews 6.
[39:43] therefore leaving the principles of the
[39:44] doctrine of christ let us go on into
[39:46] perfection
[39:48] not laying again the foundation of
[39:49] repentance from dead worse and of faith
[39:51] toward god now we covered all that of
[39:53] the doctrine of baptism and of laying on
[39:54] of hands and resurrection of the dead
[39:57] and of eternal judgment and this will we
[40:00] do if god permits all right so paul's
[40:03] saying we gotta take that foundation and
[40:05] build on it all right
[40:07] hebrews 11
[40:08] 6
[40:11] but without faith it is impossible to
[40:14] please him who god
[40:16] for he that cometh to god must believe
[40:17] that he is is what god
[40:21] and a rewarder of them that diligently
[40:23] there's that word diligent paul liked
[40:25] that word and so did peter diligently
[40:27] seek him
[40:30] and then hebrews 11 1 now faith is the
[40:32] substance of things hoped for the
[40:34] evidence of things
[40:36] not seen now let's go back to our chart
[40:38] just one second
[40:39] and realize one thing's for sure
[40:42] it's going to take a lot of faith
[40:45] because it's real wide down here but
[40:47] watch how it narrows up but it's going
[40:48] to take a lot of faith put that first
[40:50] chart back up um
[40:52] brother anderson
[40:55] because look
[40:56] faith is the substance of things hoped
[40:59] for right
[41:00] the evidence of things not seen
[41:03] now you can't take we were talking about
[41:05] that a few minutes ago you can't take my
[41:07] brain out
[41:10] and show me virtue
[41:13] so it's unseen
[41:14] but it can be shown
[41:17] right it can be manifested same way with
[41:20] brother dale what he's preaching you
[41:21] know you can't see god
[41:23] but the vessel he's in is manifesting
[41:25] who that person is
[41:27] and
[41:28] this look faith is the substance what is
[41:31] the substance
[41:32] it's something more real
[41:35] because to me your new birth is more
[41:37] real than you are
[41:40] we must realize if we realize that the
[41:42] new birth that we got
[41:44] is more real than this man you see
[41:46] standing here then that man will take
[41:49] over the problems being is we've had
[41:51] this man suppress that man so much
[41:54] till he can't work
[41:57] but by use by exercising
[42:01] strong muscles of faith
[42:04] to me now
[42:06] when i read faith is the substance
[42:08] here's the substance that's right
[42:12] this is the substance of your faith
[42:15] you can't have
[42:16] these virtues without having this faith
[42:19] first you can have human ones
[42:22] but not temperance faith and knowledge
[42:24] faith and virtue faith like we've been
[42:26] talking about because it comes straight
[42:28] from god all right so you have to start
[42:30] here and this is the substance of things
[42:32] hoped for
[42:34] the evidence because what this is going
[42:36] to be in evidence this is going to be
[42:38] it's going to be evident
[42:40] who has these virtues because brother
[42:42] braham said you know where you're at at
[42:43] god with god
[42:45] at any time
[42:46] so the substance of this faith of my
[42:48] faith from now on the substance of my
[42:50] faith is going to be
[42:52] those things right there
[42:54] that's the substance the only way i'm
[42:56] going to show my faith is by living
[42:58] those virtues
[42:59] all right
[43:00] everybody is that okay all right
[43:03] but there it's a belief and a conviction
[43:06] it's a conviction we must we must be
[43:09] convinced
[43:11] that this is the end time we must be
[43:12] confined convinced that god sent us a
[43:15] prophet but we also need to be convinced
[43:17] that somebody has come
[43:19] to speak to you
[43:21] to bring you to these things because
[43:23] you're not going to get them sitting out
[43:24] under a tree or where you think you can
[43:26] sit in your living room and get them you
[43:28] can't right right all right
[43:31] you just can't i you can
[43:33] you just can't because the bible says
[43:35] you can't all right
[43:36] so now let's go to now we remember we
[43:38] went through justification
[43:40] outside court sanctification still
[43:42] outside but here's the inner court this
[43:45] is the holy of holies this is where you
[43:47] and god alone are you have a lot of
[43:49] things go on here and not be in the body
[43:51] of christ but once you receive that new
[43:53] birth
[43:55] because remember you can get the holy
[43:56] ghost and not be born again
[43:59] on your spirit an anointing all right
[44:01] but once you get the new birth that
[44:03] means you have been what regen are
[44:06] regenerated
[44:08] from that man that we were talking about
[44:10] this man that was born of samuel and
[44:11] peggy dale now there's not two or three
[44:12] people in me and i'm not schizophrenic
[44:14] right okay but when god comes in and he
[44:17] molds to my soul
[44:19] brother brown talks about vulcanize he
[44:21] vulcanizes that thing together and when
[44:23] he does then it's not
[44:25] god's
[44:27] faith anymore
[44:30] it's your faith amen because it didn't
[44:32] say add to god's faith
[44:34] it said add to your faith the faith that
[44:36] you got add
[44:38] verse you shall now let's go to the
[44:40] chart with virtue on it now remember you
[44:42] got to add to what you believe
[44:45] these virtues what you believe because
[44:48] remember we'll read that quote in a few
[44:49] minutes let's read let's go and read
[44:51] quote one two and three i'm sorry i
[44:52] skipped ahead here
[44:57] sorry brother anderson i heard him
[44:59] could be put in reverse
[45:01] thought you a perfect man this is one i
[45:03] like i'm going to read it every time
[45:05] that we're here notice you must be born
[45:07] again and when you're born again you
[45:08] can't be born again without having faith
[45:11] that's right
[45:12] so you see on my chart here i got the
[45:14] very foundation faith is the foundation
[45:16] of all of it now scroll all the way up
[45:20] to here you're possessed of one that
[45:22] dominates your life
[45:24] just depends on how much faith you have
[45:26] is how high you can rise
[45:29] so it's left all up to you
[45:31] you can study to make yourself approved
[45:33] or you can sit there and you know
[45:34] whatever you want to do we can't make
[45:36] you that's one thing for sure
[45:39] but first it's got to be faith let me
[45:42] stay on that foundation for a while
[45:44] faith is what you must believe
[45:47] so you got to believe it and what is it
[45:49] it's a holy evidence right you can you
[45:51] can present a little bit of virtue of
[45:53] knowledge but it's got to be a holy
[45:54] virtue or what we call
[45:56] virtue faith now go to that one now the
[45:59] chart of virtue faith add to what you
[46:01] believe virtue
[46:03] all right which is virtue faith
[46:06] right here
[46:07] there's virtue of faith that's what
[46:09] we're climbing up the ladder we're going
[46:11] up the ladder there
[46:12] to
[46:13] perfection all right
[46:15] remember we're working on life and
[46:17] godliness so we're working on the life
[46:18] we live plus the godly part of us being
[46:22] christians mark 5 verse 30
[46:25] just to kind of get to i'm going to try
[46:27] to get to one more virtue and then we'll
[46:28] do the next one this evening
[46:30] mark 5 verse 30
[46:35] and jesus immediately knowing in himself
[46:37] that virtue had gone out of him turned
[46:40] him about in the press and said
[46:42] who touched my clothes
[46:44] all right so there's the virtue part
[46:47] that we're looking at
[46:48] something had gone out of him which
[46:51] virtue now we understand is what
[46:54] strength
[46:55] virtue is strength because what did
[46:57] jesus tell them
[46:58] here in let's define virtue it should
[47:01] come up next all right see it's called
[47:02] dunamis
[47:03] which is power mighty work and strength
[47:06] so your faith has got strength but
[47:08] brother brown said remember your faith
[47:10] has to have muscles
[47:12] remember he said your faith has got to
[47:13] have muscles all right but it's an
[47:15] inherent power
[47:19] so when you get the new birth that
[47:20] power's in there
[47:24] it's inherent
[47:26] power residing in a thing by virtue of
[47:29] its nature so see we're talking about
[47:31] the very nature of god so the virtues
[47:33] are the very nature of god
[47:35] all right
[47:36] but you still are on free moral agency
[47:38] you can choose every day whether to
[47:40] accept or reject
[47:42] what you hear what you see and what you
[47:44] do all right see that comes to me up to
[47:47] knowledge but you got to have virtue or
[47:49] strength you got to have a strong faith
[47:52] before you can have knowledge
[47:54] not just faith faith alone won't do it
[47:56] remember
[47:57] you've got to have virtue faith which is
[47:59] a strength faith
[48:01] moral power and excellence of soul
[48:04] listen all these things are overcomings
[48:06] you can put the word overcoming and all
[48:07] that right because
[48:10] look
[48:11] without moral power what are you going
[48:12] to be
[48:14] i am m-o-r-a-l you're going to be
[48:16] immoral
[48:18] without moral power you're going to do
[48:19] immoral things right we all did
[48:23] right right
[48:24] but with moral but with the new birth it
[48:26] gives us moral power and excellence of
[48:28] soul that puts it right down into person
[48:31] right
[48:32] all right let's go to acts 1 verse 8.
[48:34] this is the same dunamis
[48:36] jesus telling them you shall receive
[48:38] power
[48:39] after right
[48:41] that the holy ghost has come upon you
[48:44] after that the holy ghost has come upon
[48:45] you and you shall be witnesses unto me
[48:48] both in jerusalem and judea and samaria
[48:50] and to the uttermost parts of the earth
[48:52] and to me and you that uttermost part
[48:53] means us
[48:54] because it came to you and i but
[48:56] remember he didn't just say that to the
[48:58] disciples
[49:01] he said it to us you shall receive power
[49:04] dunamis virtue after that the holy ghost
[49:07] has come upon you
[49:09] because in acts 3 i didn't put it down
[49:11] but you you remember in acts 3 what
[49:13] happened
[49:14] peter he has no money
[49:18] he doesn't have a you know he's probably
[49:20] quit his job because he's going around
[49:21] preaching and teaching and all that you
[49:23] know and
[49:23] and trying to live off the ties of the
[49:25] people
[49:26] that probably didn't work very well but
[49:28] he didn't have no money for this man he
[49:30] said silver and gold have i none
[49:32] but such as i have i give unto you
[49:33] what'd he give him that power
[49:36] that power that came out of him that man
[49:38] he said look on us
[49:40] well see that was very powerful because
[49:41] what he done he got his attention the
[49:43] prophet of god he got his attention to
[49:45] quit looking at all the other stuff and
[49:46] you know what i believe the man the man
[49:48] entered into a channel to even forget
[49:50] about that his legs didn't work right
[49:52] he there and that's what we have to do
[49:54] we got to enter into a channel of so
[49:56] much faith till we forget about what
[49:58] we're hurting or what's doing this or
[50:00] what's doing that to us he entered into
[50:02] so much of a channel of virtue
[50:05] that he forgot that he couldn't walk
[50:07] right
[50:08] right he forgot he couldn't walk because
[50:10] the next thing that happened was peter
[50:12] reaches and gets him picks him up and
[50:15] the bible says strength entered into his
[50:17] legs all right well it wasn't there
[50:19] before
[50:21] it had come from somewhere so that's the
[50:23] same thing with you and i
[50:24] in this virtue faith that we must have
[50:27] this powerful faith
[50:29] and it's a substance that's added to
[50:31] your faith
[50:32] right because faith is a substance all
[50:34] right talk about the generator the other
[50:36] day we'll talk about you know plugging
[50:37] in the generator we believe that
[50:39] generator has power so we plug into that
[50:41] generator and we're able to do things
[50:43] well you know what the generator is
[50:44] that's god himself
[50:46] he's the he don't need an atomic power
[50:48] he doesn't need he doesn't need georgia
[50:50] power to do anything for him no
[50:53] he has his own power right and you know
[50:55] what he didn't say he didn't keep it he
[50:57] gave it out
[50:58] he gave the blessings out to me and you
[51:00] so that we can plug into that generator
[51:02] and we can get something from god all
[51:04] right let's go to quote number four
[51:07] statue of a perfect man i like this one
[51:10] because you know what you can have
[51:11] virtue
[51:12] like i said many times before
[51:14] there are
[51:15] and it's a characteristic that that we
[51:18] all
[51:19] we haven't won or we don't have it you
[51:21] can have a i've seen teachers that
[51:23] shouldn't be teachers
[51:25] i'm talking about natural i'm talking
[51:27] about natural i'm not talking about here
[51:28] i'm talking about natural teachers in
[51:30] the world that went to school 18 years
[51:34] got 73 degrees and couldn't teach a mule
[51:37] how to turn around and walk the other
[51:38] direction right it's just a gift
[51:41] but she but she he or whoever it was
[51:44] they got the power
[51:46] the degrees the knowledge they got all
[51:48] that they just didn't have a way to a
[51:50] pass
[51:51] that can pass through to the people so
[51:53] god says okay i'm going to get a pastor
[51:55] evangelist a teacher a preacher and all
[51:58] these five things
[52:00] and that's my that's my outlet
[52:03] right that's my pass that i'm going to
[52:05] pass it to you when i look it's not a
[52:08] dead end street when it passes to you
[52:13] it keeps going right
[52:15] now all right so i've got to have virtue
[52:18] and a past that it can pass forward from
[52:21] me to the people
[52:23] all right same way with all of us
[52:25] because virtue went out of him to the
[52:28] people
[52:29] before you can let it out you've got to
[52:31] have it first
[52:33] you haven't got it it won't come out
[52:36] there's nothing for it to come out of
[52:39] all right somebody looking at you as a
[52:41] christian and tomorrow see you out there
[52:42] carrying on like a sinner not much
[52:44] virtue can be drawn from that seat right
[52:47] right right what happens is
[52:49] it's like brother brown said it becomes
[52:51] a stumbling block
[52:53] right when you go and you
[52:56] profess one thing and then you act like
[52:58] another
[53:00] and you know what let's be honest a lot
[53:01] of times we do act like sinners
[53:04] oh it's just me then i'm sorry it's just
[53:06] me pray for me
[53:08] maybe i'm the one that needs to be
[53:09] taught all this no it happens to all of
[53:12] us
[53:14] but remember we're human that's human
[53:16] mistakes but it's what we do afterwards
[53:18] that's right
[53:19] it's what we do afterwards we sin every
[53:22] day but you know we ask god to forgive
[53:24] us and it's not just to me it's not just
[53:26] god forgive me and then go on no you
[53:27] really have because godly sorrow leadeth
[53:29] you through repentance something inside
[53:30] of you says i need to repent for that
[53:32] all right so that's the same and that's
[53:34] what virtue is though because what
[53:35] you're drawing from you're drawing from
[53:36] the virtue of god
[53:39] and he's inside of you you don't have to
[53:40] bring it from somewhere you just got to
[53:42] let it come out
[53:43] all right
[53:44] so see you carrying out like a sinner
[53:46] not much virtue can be drawn from that
[53:48] see right okay so now that's virtue
[53:50] virtue is strength
[53:52] power
[53:54] it's a substance that's added to your
[53:55] faith so it's virtue is not something
[53:57] you can you can touch or feel or or you
[54:00] know or draw
[54:02] but it's something that you you live out
[54:04] okay you live it out and there's no way
[54:06] you can live it out unless you have it
[54:08] so you got to have it to live it out and
[54:10] you got to have somebody to teach you
[54:11] how to
[54:13] know that you might already have it
[54:15] do you understand what i'm saying that
[54:16] you might you already got it it's just
[54:18] got to be brought out so i said a good
[54:20] teacher will teach you
[54:22] how to get things done i've always said
[54:25] don't show don't don't tell me how to do
[54:27] something show me how to do it
[54:29] remember the old adage you know take
[54:31] somebody fishing 365 days a year but if
[54:34] you'll ever teach him how to fish
[54:36] one time you won't have to go with him
[54:38] to 364 days he'll know how to fish
[54:41] that same way with the word of god and i
[54:43] believe that's what brother dale's done
[54:44] he's built some character in a lot of us
[54:46] that have that that we can fish now you
[54:49] know we don't have to we don't have to
[54:51] depend on him fishing all the time
[54:54] he is the chief fisherman though
[54:56] he's got a fish first
[54:58] he's our pastor so there's no there's no
[55:00] uh there's no doubt where that comes
[55:02] from yeah man
[55:04] that was a week amen
[55:07] oh well
[55:08] some of you really just can't get over
[55:10] it can you knowledge knowledge we need
[55:13] to have knowledge here's here's one i
[55:15] really enjoy because knowledge to me
[55:19] brings if you got virtue
[55:21] but watch you've got to have knowledge
[55:23] faith so you take the faith that you got
[55:25] and you got to
[55:27] you've got to discern now
[55:30] today you're discerning just like i said
[55:32] last sunday today you're discerning
[55:34] whether i'm telling you the truth or not
[55:36] whether my ways of showing it like
[55:38] brother dale
[55:39] sometimes the way you show it you just
[55:41] got to look at the word look at what the
[55:44] word that's being said jesus was telling
[55:46] those pharisees you bunch of sinners
[55:49] hypocrites i mean he named all that off
[55:52] but he was trying to get them to see
[55:53] they were lost so that when he did die
[55:56] they would know that he died for them
[55:58] and they'd go get saved
[56:00] he wouldn't just tell him sure he knew
[56:02] whether they were lost forever
[56:06] but you know what
[56:07] god knew before he even created a man
[56:09] who was gonna be lost and who wasn't but
[56:10] you know what he's let this thing go six
[56:13] seven eight nine thousand years
[56:15] what a patient god
[56:17] he knows who's going to be saved
[56:20] so brother richard why is he put up with
[56:21] us
[56:22] he's got patience
[56:24] he's got all kinds of patience
[56:26] he said thousands of years of being
[56:28] patient
[56:29] amen
[56:30] that's why i love god
[56:32] and his word so we have knowledge faith
[56:34] so let's go to proverbs 1
[56:37] just for background the fear of the lord
[56:39] is the beginning of knowledge
[56:41] but fools despise wisdom and instruction
[56:45] now everybody knows what instruction is
[56:47] it's like the scripture that says if you
[56:48] can't take correction you're a different
[56:50] kind of child
[56:51] all right so but fools despise wisdom
[56:54] and just in instruction because what did
[56:56] jesus say he said fools and slow of
[56:58] heart what they didn't take his
[57:00] instruction they didn't they didn't use
[57:02] the wisdom he was given at the time but
[57:05] remember
[57:06] he was talking to the disciples when he
[57:08] said fools
[57:09] old fools and slow of heart but when
[57:12] they received the new birth
[57:14] they weren't fools anymore
[57:16] that's why god had patience
[57:18] proverbs 24 5
[57:20] just to kind of get get us up to the
[57:22] next one a wise man is strong yeah a man
[57:25] of knowledge
[57:26] increases strength so see you look how
[57:28] god built that faith
[57:30] virtue strength
[57:32] now you come up here to knowledge well
[57:34] you don't do away with that strength
[57:36] you take that strong virtue and you add
[57:39] it to your knowledge
[57:41] amen add to your faith virtue to virtue
[57:44] knowledge to knowledge it's all
[57:45] connected
[57:46] so increases that strength that you have
[57:50] now
[57:51] let's just be real honest you can you
[57:53] can listen to somebody make a speech and
[57:56] get something out of it but boy there's
[57:58] some people that can just hold your
[58:00] attention brother branham could just
[58:01] hold your attention
[58:03] he you know he was and because that was
[58:05] his gift that he could hold your
[58:07] attention and what did you add when you
[58:09] when you saw that the man had strength
[58:12] what you discerned that what he was
[58:14] saying was right
[58:16] okay so you discerned what he was saying
[58:18] was the truth so if you discern what he
[58:20] was saying was the truth then see you go
[58:22] on right on up to temperance and
[58:24] patience because you can't move without
[58:26] having these virtues as they're given
[58:29] they're given in that line
[58:31] because
[58:32] they
[58:33] because god knows the only way we're
[58:34] going to get it is that line or he would
[58:36] have put it another way because remember
[58:38] when god thinks of something he can't
[58:40] change the thought
[58:41] the thought he has has to come straight
[58:43] down
[58:45] not like you and me we can have a
[58:46] thought change it god can't god can't
[58:48] have a thought and then say oops
[58:50] no whatever he said that's what it is
[58:52] that's why we can depend on this
[58:55] the word of god that if he said it it's
[58:57] going to happen all right all right so
[59:00] now
[59:00] the word knowledge
[59:02] means gnosis
[59:06] and it's knowledge signified in general
[59:08] intelligence of course that's man's
[59:09] knowledge the general knowledge of
[59:11] christian religion but look the deeper
[59:13] or more perfect
[59:15] and enlarged knowledge of this religion
[59:18] right
[59:19] such as belongs to what
[59:21] more advanced
[59:24] paul says those that want milk want meat
[59:26] that comes from milk wants meat
[59:29] you never get from one plus one equals
[59:31] two two plus two equals you know four
[59:33] you don't ever get away from that right
[59:35] all right you have to use that right on
[59:37] up into calculus and trigonometry and
[59:39] all those things so you same thing
[59:41] you know the more you look at this
[59:43] um
[59:44] brother bob asked me last sunday he said
[59:46] you were holding out downstairs i said
[59:48] no i just didn't know that two years ago
[59:50] i said god's revealed more to me i
[59:52] wasn't holding it back
[59:55] bob said you've been holding back you
[59:56] didn't say any of that downstairs i said
[59:58] well i'm not holding back i said it's
[59:59] just become more real than it was then
[1:00:01] amen
[1:00:02] that's why i know it's a revelation when
[1:00:04] it becomes more real you think man i got
[1:00:06] this thing down a statue of a perfect
[1:00:08] man 60 sermons i can do this and i can
[1:00:10] walk up here and i can do the same thing
[1:00:11] again and then god just raised it on up
[1:00:13] another level and same thing with your
[1:00:15] understanding your understanding has got
[1:00:17] to be the same way i can know all this
[1:00:20] and if i can't get it to the people you
[1:00:22] got to have a pass you got to be able to
[1:00:23] get it to the people all right
[1:00:26] such as belongs to more advanced
[1:00:28] especially if things lawful and unlawful
[1:00:30] for christians moral wisdom such as this
[1:00:32] scene and what right living remember
[1:00:35] we're talking about life and godliness
[1:00:37] all right so we're talking about how we
[1:00:38] live our normal life and beco and be
[1:00:41] christians and know how to live that
[1:00:43] life because remember
[1:00:45] let's be honest
[1:00:47] we live a christian life all the time
[1:00:49] honestly we do but 80 of the time it's
[1:00:52] work
[1:00:53] home
[1:00:54] life
[1:00:56] problems
[1:00:58] amen
[1:01:00] it really is that's why you know i have
[1:01:02] to come here to get my fuel
[1:01:04] uh and get all that dirty stuff off of
[1:01:06] you because 80 of the time you live in
[1:01:07] the flesh
[1:01:08] all right
[1:01:10] but that christianity is a hundred
[1:01:12] percent of the time it's just gotta live
[1:01:14] out you gotta let it live out if you
[1:01:15] don't have it it ain't gonna live out
[1:01:17] all right
[1:01:18] uh the reason why i'm saying this is i'm
[1:01:20] getting to a point here that i wanna
[1:01:22] make
[1:01:23] i don't think that being
[1:01:26] at the full stature of a perfect man
[1:01:29] makes you a god zombie where's louise
[1:01:32] how about them zombies
[1:01:34] it don't make you a god zombie
[1:01:36] you know where you just you're just
[1:01:37] brainless
[1:01:39] or or it doesn't actually make you where
[1:01:41] where that that uh
[1:01:43] sister sharon has to go up on a hey
[1:01:46] good to see you
[1:01:47] has to go up she don't have to go up on
[1:01:48] the mountain and talk to
[1:01:50] yoda you understand why i'm calling out
[1:01:53] just in plain terms you don't have to go
[1:01:54] you don't have to go to the man you know
[1:01:56] all the comic books and everything if if
[1:01:58] there's a wise man he's always whip on
[1:01:59] the mountain sitting by himself see that
[1:02:01] doesn't make you that either way it
[1:02:03] makes you a balanced person a balanced
[1:02:06] christian
[1:02:08] is what lives out these virtues
[1:02:11] and sure he that lacketh these things is
[1:02:14] blind and that's true we are blind in
[1:02:16] certain ways i was blind
[1:02:19] i taught sunday school downstairs i went
[1:02:20] through all these virtues and i still
[1:02:22] was blind of certain things
[1:02:24] until god opened my eyes
[1:02:27] studying a little bit deeper
[1:02:30] going over things remember exercising
[1:02:34] exercising your faith you know if you
[1:02:35] want to get real good at something you
[1:02:37] got to learn it you got to exercise it
[1:02:38] you got to do those things but knowledge
[1:02:41] the deeper more perfect and enlarged
[1:02:43] knowledge
[1:02:44] of this religion all right
[1:02:46] i say christianity because remember
[1:02:48] religion can be
[1:02:50] something else
[1:02:53] religion can be of the devil
[1:02:56] but a christian can't be of the devil
[1:02:58] amen
[1:03:00] all right let's go to quote number five
[1:03:03] and let's read what the prophet of god
[1:03:04] said about this i'm spending a little
[1:03:06] too much time on this but i'm sorry i i
[1:03:08] think we need to really get down if we
[1:03:09] don't get these down here at the bottom
[1:03:11] them up here at the top brother brown
[1:03:12] said if you don't have them
[1:03:14] those first ones right you're going to
[1:03:15] fall off
[1:03:17] and then thirdly you add knowledge
[1:03:19] knowledge now that don't mean worldly
[1:03:21] knowledge because that's foolishness to
[1:03:23] god
[1:03:24] but knowledge to judge judge what right
[1:03:28] from wrong
[1:03:29] how do you judge it then if you got
[1:03:31] christian knowledge with your virtue
[1:03:33] he's what he say your virtue it now has
[1:03:36] become your virtue
[1:03:37] all right
[1:03:41] christian knowledge with your virtue and
[1:03:42] faith you judge whether the word is
[1:03:45] right or wrong all right even when we
[1:03:48] judge let me add this even when we judge
[1:03:50] that it's right we've still got a avenue
[1:03:52] that we got to go through
[1:03:54] we just can't hey listen we can all say
[1:03:56] the word of god's right
[1:03:58] close the book and go home
[1:04:00] now is it really that
[1:04:02] no
[1:04:02] you know better than that
[1:04:05] because remember the devil was there
[1:04:06] when this was rope
[1:04:12] if you can lay aside all your creeds and
[1:04:14] your unbelief
[1:04:16] everything that you claim to have done
[1:04:19] then you have knowledge to believe that
[1:04:21] god cannot lie let every man's word be a
[1:04:23] lie but mind be true see now you're
[1:04:26] getting knowledge that's supreme
[1:04:28] knowledge
[1:04:29] you don't have to have four degrees in
[1:04:30] some college or something like that to
[1:04:32] have it because all these virtues are
[1:04:34] given to you by god
[1:04:37] to place upon the foundation of your
[1:04:39] faith
[1:04:40] that you hey i like the brother puts it
[1:04:42] all back on you
[1:04:43] that you might come to the full stature
[1:04:45] of a real living man of god
[1:04:48] yes sir i like that quote let's go to
[1:04:50] the next one
[1:04:53] because i want to strike that and then
[1:04:54] we're going to get into temperance i'll
[1:04:55] make you all mad for a second service
[1:05:01] i really want you to get mad with
[1:05:02] yourself
[1:05:04] i got mad with myself when i started
[1:05:06] doing when i even when i started over
[1:05:07] that i should have brother bob i should
[1:05:09] have dug a little bit deeper
[1:05:11] i was a little dilatory in studying that
[1:05:13] i didn't go way deep into these things
[1:05:15] but um not knowing that god was you know
[1:05:18] gonna help us do this or you're getting
[1:05:20] to be a pretty good man right now you're
[1:05:22] coming up what with with faith then with
[1:05:24] virtue then knowledge see how it's
[1:05:26] building this man you can see there's no
[1:05:28] way escaping it this is the way
[1:05:32] to become in the full stature of christ
[1:05:34] yes sir to judge judge wright judge
[1:05:38] whether it's right or wrong to believe
[1:05:40] god's word judge whether it's right or
[1:05:43] wrong whether i should serve a creed or
[1:05:44] serve god judge whether it's right or
[1:05:46] wrong i should be born again or join a
[1:05:48] church
[1:05:49] then you beginning
[1:05:50] then you beginning judge right when the
[1:05:53] preacher says the days and miracles has
[1:05:54] passed the bible says jesus christ the
[1:05:56] same yesterday and forever now which
[1:05:57] you're going to believe see it all comes
[1:05:59] still back to you it's what you believe
[1:06:02] is what going to determine it all right
[1:06:03] so let's uh
[1:06:06] let me say a few things here and then
[1:06:07] we'll go to temperance
[1:06:09] but remember that word knowledge also
[1:06:12] meant discernment now discernment means
[1:06:14] the ability to pick right from wrong
[1:06:17] so so you're discerning even even at
[1:06:19] home life
[1:06:21] even here
[1:06:23] anywhere you're every day you're
[1:06:25] discerning between what whether you
[1:06:26] should do this or shouldn't do this or
[1:06:28] whether this is right or this is wrong
[1:06:30] or whether i should see this or
[1:06:31] shouldn't see this amen
[1:06:33] all right a lot of that's a lot of
[1:06:35] that's human knowledge
[1:06:37] but remember
[1:06:38] discernment brother brown said to say to
[1:06:40] see whether the word's right or not
[1:06:43] amen
[1:06:45] listen the bible says for sake father
[1:06:47] mother sister brother
[1:06:50] and follow me now how many of us do that
[1:06:54] well my sister's sick or my brother's
[1:06:55] sick or my cat's dog died
[1:06:58] and you don't show up for church it's an
[1:07:00] overcoming right
[1:07:05] that's how silly some of the excuses are
[1:07:07] excuses excuses
[1:07:10] but discernment is required of a
[1:07:12] christian
[1:07:13] it's not a it's not a it's a requirement
[1:07:15] that's why knowledge is a requirement
[1:07:17] because it's required for you to discern
[1:07:21] you know what discernment's going to do
[1:07:22] it's going to put you down the right
[1:07:24] path or the wrong path
[1:07:26] and i'm not talking whether going
[1:07:28] backwards
[1:07:29] i'm talking about in your new birth
[1:07:32] the discernment if it's required of you
[1:07:34] it's going to run you down here how many
[1:07:35] of you went to another church and you
[1:07:37] decided or discerned that that wasn't
[1:07:39] where you needed to be amen so what did
[1:07:43] what did your discernment do see you had
[1:07:44] discernment then
[1:07:46] you discerned that something else was
[1:07:48] better than what you had over here all
[1:07:50] right
[1:07:52] and discernment also comes to the word
[1:07:54] wisdom
[1:07:57] wisdom is the ability to think and act
[1:08:00] using knowledge
[1:08:03] because wisdom requires that you know
[1:08:05] something about something
[1:08:07] you can't have wisdom like i said about
[1:08:09] electricity and not have knowledge of it
[1:08:12] and not have participated in a class or
[1:08:15] either learned by a journeyman or trade
[1:08:17] or something somebody showed you
[1:08:20] see
[1:08:21] so there's wisdom the ability to think
[1:08:23] and act using knowledge experience
[1:08:25] understanding common sense and that last
[1:08:28] word we use we we ended up last sunday
[1:08:31] with insight
[1:08:32] that word insight is is you can put it
[1:08:35] right there with knowledge all right and
[1:08:37] look at what brother brown said
[1:08:39] the last the quote number seven
[1:08:42] and then we'll get into the temperance
[1:08:43] just for a minute
[1:08:44] and uh and speak of it temperance and
[1:08:46] patience maybe a little bit later on
[1:08:48] quote number seven all right god
[1:08:50] manifesting his gift oh i may stop here
[1:08:53] just a minute that i believe these
[1:08:54] nations are getting their last mercy
[1:08:56] call
[1:08:56] i believe i'm a record on tape by saying
[1:08:58] it but i believe it with all my heart
[1:09:00] that there's not a person on earth who
[1:09:02] could ever shake this thing back to its
[1:09:03] condition again
[1:09:05] so we forget about that all right we're
[1:09:07] not trying to reform the world
[1:09:10] right this statue of a perfect man is
[1:09:12] trying to transform
[1:09:15] nominal or our baby christians
[1:09:18] into full-fledged adults
[1:09:20] all right
[1:09:21] and an adult took a body change the baby
[1:09:23] didn't
[1:09:27] the man christ jesus
[1:09:30] not the baby
[1:09:32] it'll take the move of god the second
[1:09:34] coming of jesus christ so the only thing
[1:09:36] that's going to ever shake or move this
[1:09:37] thing is the second coming of jesus
[1:09:38] christ all right look at the
[1:09:40] indifference in the people today
[1:09:43] look how unconcerned they are you even
[1:09:45] see it in the christian in the christian
[1:09:46] world
[1:09:47] i talking to a guy the other day that's
[1:09:49] a um
[1:09:50] a baptist and and
[1:09:53] i think they're just i think they're
[1:09:55] done with what the denomination the
[1:09:57] world's doing to them
[1:09:59] or for them nothing there's nothing
[1:10:01] there's nothing for them out there
[1:10:03] but now remember that's why i made that
[1:10:05] statement the other sunday the foolish
[1:10:07] virgin in the bible
[1:10:09] come to the wise virgin
[1:10:12] why were they looking for oil why
[1:10:14] weren't they satisfied where they had
[1:10:16] been all them years they felt a pull
[1:10:19] they felt somebody that's come all the
[1:10:21] way up this statue of a perfect man i'm
[1:10:22] talking about one person i'm talking
[1:10:24] about a group that has come to a place
[1:10:26] that where god they feel the pull of god
[1:10:28] and they think well hey i want some of
[1:10:31] that
[1:10:32] i want some of that so i'm going to come
[1:10:34] and get i know where to go get it from
[1:10:37] those foolish virgins didn't wander
[1:10:38] around in the wilderness they came right
[1:10:40] to the wise virgin and said give us some
[1:10:43] of your oil what's oil the holy ghost
[1:10:45] give us some of that where we we you
[1:10:47] know and a lot of them are in
[1:10:48] justification a lot of them are in
[1:10:49] sanctification they re they live a good
[1:10:51] sanctified life but they just have
[1:10:53] nobody to take them on to the new birth
[1:10:56] all right
[1:10:57] but look at the indifference in the
[1:10:58] people today
[1:11:00] look how unconcerned they are eating
[1:11:02] drinking marrying giving in marriage
[1:11:03] just as it was predicted having a form
[1:11:06] of godliness and denying the power
[1:11:08] thereof the bible said from such turn
[1:11:10] away very religious he didn't say very
[1:11:12] christian he's a very religious
[1:11:14] they've always been religious but not
[1:11:17] having the spiritual
[1:11:19] insight to understand right that's the
[1:11:22] main thing right that's the thing that
[1:11:25] designates your eternal destination
[1:11:28] is your spiritual conception i like that
[1:11:31] right
[1:11:32] amen your spiritual conception of what
[1:11:35] of what you're hearing right
[1:11:37] all right let's go to the next one
[1:11:43] you recall that i mentioned at the
[1:11:45] beginning of this message that this book
[1:11:46] we are studying which is the bible
[1:11:49] is the actual revelation of jesus
[1:11:51] himself in the church
[1:11:53] and his work in the future ages that's
[1:11:55] what brother dale's been reading in
[1:11:56] revelations 1 then i mentioned that it
[1:11:59] takes the holy spirit to give us
[1:12:00] revelation or we will fail to get it
[1:12:03] bringing these two thoughts together you
[1:12:06] will see that it won't take just
[1:12:07] ordinary study
[1:12:10] right that's right
[1:12:11] i get i get onto the sunday school class
[1:12:13] downstairs a lot when we do responsive
[1:12:15] reading they read it like reading a
[1:12:16] newspaper
[1:12:19] a comma means you got to pause
[1:12:21] think about something
[1:12:23] right
[1:12:24] all these all these um a period stop
[1:12:30] instead of just reading it like a
[1:12:31] newspaper i've stopped them several
[1:12:33] times haven't i hey man
[1:12:35] i've stopped him many times i said we
[1:12:37] got we reading it like a newspaper
[1:12:38] you're not reading it to be you're
[1:12:40] reading it just to get through
[1:12:43] you heard people that goes through the
[1:12:44] motions just to get through school
[1:12:47] and the teachers didn't like them so
[1:12:48] much they graduated them
[1:12:52] well i wasn't one of those but there's a
[1:12:53] brother of mine that
[1:12:58] he made it thank you
[1:13:01] it's always the middle child always
[1:13:05] that means
[1:13:06] that means this book
[1:13:08] can't be revealed look it's going to
[1:13:09] take the operation
[1:13:11] of the holy ghost
[1:13:13] all right that means this book can't be
[1:13:15] revealed to anyone but a special class
[1:13:17] of people right what believers that's
[1:13:20] right
[1:13:21] that you believe that's where you're
[1:13:22] going to get it from right now all right
[1:13:25] it will take one with prophetic
[1:13:28] insight right
[1:13:30] our prophetic knowledge
[1:13:32] all right
[1:13:33] it will require the ability to hear from
[1:13:35] god
[1:13:36] it will require supernatural instruction
[1:13:39] not just a student it's what i'm saying
[1:13:41] not just a pseudonym
[1:13:42] comparing verse reverse because if you
[1:13:44] compare verse to verse you've got
[1:13:45] matthew 28 19 acts 2 38 you've got
[1:13:48] several here that look like they're
[1:13:50] contradictory but they're not but they
[1:13:52] look contradicted to dick contradictory
[1:13:54] to an untrained eye but once you see the
[1:13:56] revelation
[1:13:58] it will require spiritual instruction
[1:14:00] that matthew 28 19 says the same things
[1:14:03] acts 2 38 says all right same thing
[1:14:05] there's no deviation it's the same thing
[1:14:08] all right but it's just hidden from the
[1:14:10] wise and prudent not just the student
[1:14:12] comparing verse with verse though that
[1:14:14] is good
[1:14:16] but a mystery requires the teaching of
[1:14:18] the spirit or it never becomes clear
[1:14:22] how we need to hear from god and lay
[1:14:24] ourselves open and become yielded to the
[1:14:25] spirit to hear and know and that word no
[1:14:29] is part of what
[1:14:31] knowledge
[1:14:32] knowledge all right it's the ability to
[1:14:34] know all right is everybody okay with
[1:14:36] knowledge so it's got to be
[1:14:38] discerned
[1:14:39] it's got to you got to have wisdom and
[1:14:42] wisdom comes from that because you know
[1:14:44] what
[1:14:46] without discernment
[1:14:48] how good is your wisdom
[1:14:54] i mean how good is it if you can't just
[1:14:56] you got to discern first before you
[1:14:57] become wise
[1:14:59] all right
[1:15:00] and then you know what then somebody can
[1:15:02] draw from that
[1:15:03] it's like brother brown said like
[1:15:04] brother dale said several times he you
[1:15:06] know i and sure i feel sorry for
[1:15:10] um rookie doctors but
[1:15:12] you always got to have there's always
[1:15:13] you got to have your first operation
[1:15:15] sometime
[1:15:17] but i would like to have one that had
[1:15:18] some experience operate on me
[1:15:20] but somebody's got to be the
[1:15:22] practitioner or the one to practice but
[1:15:25] i would like to have somebody with what
[1:15:27] wisdom that's been that's been through
[1:15:29] that that's opened that chest up and
[1:15:31] seen that heart before all right because
[1:15:33] that's me you're dealing with right so i
[1:15:35] want somebody with some wisdom and some
[1:15:37] discernment and some knowledge
[1:15:40] that's human knowledge but what about
[1:15:41] the same way with god how are we going
[1:15:43] to draw strength and knowledge from
[1:15:44] somebody
[1:15:46] you know that doesn't know the word of
[1:15:47] god you know you just can't there's no
[1:15:49] way you can do that uh you know i made
[1:15:51] the
[1:15:52] the statement the other day about june's
[1:15:53] dad he's just a wealth of knowledge as
[1:15:56] far as a businessman but as far as
[1:15:58] knowing god he doesn't
[1:15:59] so i can't draw strength from that i
[1:16:01] can't go over there and draw strength
[1:16:03] from god
[1:16:04] for that but now i can go draw strength
[1:16:07] of a business mind
[1:16:09] which that's fine you got to do that
[1:16:10] every day that's the same way with
[1:16:11] discernment you got to i mean how would
[1:16:13] you
[1:16:14] how would it be that like say if you go
[1:16:16] to somebody and you say well
[1:16:17] this guy's going to teach us how to
[1:16:19] become successful
[1:16:22] and you say well okay who is it he said
[1:16:23] well his name's you know
[1:16:26] bill jones
[1:16:28] bill jones bill jones has been bankrupt
[1:16:30] 14 times yeah and he's bankrupt now
[1:16:33] how's he going to teach us anything so
[1:16:35] all right so how we're going to draw
[1:16:36] virtue
[1:16:38] see the virtue's not there
[1:16:40] so definitely the knowledge is not there
[1:16:42] right see how these virtues work
[1:16:43] together the virtue of me wanting to pay
[1:16:46] to go hear this guy
[1:16:48] right i ain't gonna do it right because
[1:16:50] i'm discerning that that guy if he's in
[1:16:53] 14 bankruptcies
[1:16:55] he ain't somebody i want to hear about
[1:16:56] once maybe he wants to tell us things
[1:16:58] not to do
[1:16:59] but not things to do
[1:17:01] right so that's the same way with
[1:17:03] knowledge in god you want to come to
[1:17:05] this service wherever you go and you
[1:17:08] want to believe that god's going to
[1:17:09] reveal something to you it doesn't
[1:17:11] matter who's speaking doesn't matter if
[1:17:12] it's brother collie reading the reading
[1:17:14] the responsive reading or brother dick
[1:17:16] singing you know the right song and you
[1:17:19] know
[1:17:20] what i mean to get you in an atmosphere
[1:17:22] it's god through the whole thing
[1:17:24] trying to get you to see brother you
[1:17:26] know brother richard brother boy and all
[1:17:27] those you know the song leaders set that
[1:17:29] atmosphere
[1:17:30] but that's the way it is with god so now
[1:17:34] we see that it must take prophetic
[1:17:35] insight all right
[1:17:37] now let's go to the next one this one is
[1:17:40] temperance
[1:17:43] and it's not brother brown said we'll
[1:17:44] read it he said it's not
[1:17:49] it's not to quit drinking and all that
[1:17:51] stuff right
[1:17:53] that goes out right here
[1:17:56] so don't think this right there right it
[1:17:58] goes out right here right and it don't
[1:18:00] go no further if you're still drinking
[1:18:02] some lord jesus i hope nobody is but if
[1:18:05] you're still doing that you're not even
[1:18:06] in the body yet right
[1:18:09] let's just let's
[1:18:10] just let the rubber hit the road where
[1:18:12] it is
[1:18:14] if you're still cussing
[1:18:15] if you're still doing the things of the
[1:18:17] world
[1:18:18] don't worry about this you ain't got
[1:18:20] that yet
[1:18:22] you definitely ain't got that
[1:18:24] or that or that so let's just start you
[1:18:27] know i wish to god like brother dale
[1:18:28] said i wish we all could say
[1:18:30] lord jesus i'm right here
[1:18:32] okay that's good at least you realized
[1:18:34] it right jesus couldn't get the
[1:18:36] pharisees to see that they were right
[1:18:38] there exactly if he could get them to
[1:18:39] see that they'd went to the upper room
[1:18:42] and got that right but they didn't see
[1:18:44] it all right because of their what their
[1:18:46] choice
[1:18:47] they leaned on their own understanding
[1:18:49] of that old testament we have moses
[1:18:51] quote book
[1:18:53] well you know what moses's quote book
[1:18:54] killed them
[1:18:56] moses quote but just like brother
[1:18:58] brown's quote but will kill you if it's
[1:18:59] not revealed amen the letter killeth but
[1:19:02] the spirit giveth life all right so now
[1:19:04] let's look we come through virtue faith
[1:19:07] knowledge faith
[1:19:08] now let's come to temperance faith
[1:19:11] now look
[1:19:14] what is temperance
[1:19:16] we'll define it in a minute but i want
[1:19:17] you to
[1:19:18] the lord showed me this
[1:19:20] because when you say well i got to
[1:19:22] control my temper i got to control my
[1:19:23] temper well what where's that word
[1:19:25] control
[1:19:27] look at the word control
[1:19:30] so let's take hold that right there but
[1:19:32] listen to me it says self-control but it
[1:19:35] becomes
[1:19:36] not just temperance faith it becomes a
[1:19:39] controlled faith
[1:19:44] because a lot of times our human emotion
[1:19:46] comes above that
[1:19:50] controlled faith
[1:19:51] you know who had you know the the i'll
[1:19:54] read it in a minute the greatest
[1:19:56] uh definition or um
[1:19:58] illustration of controlled faith was
[1:20:01] when jesus was on the boat of sleep
[1:20:04] remember
[1:20:05] jesus was asleep on the boat
[1:20:07] the disciples were up and storm came
[1:20:11] he was asleep
[1:20:13] he had to be woke up
[1:20:15] but once he was woke up the first thing
[1:20:17] he didn't do he didn't start looking at
[1:20:19] circumstances
[1:20:21] he didn't start looking at well can i do
[1:20:24] this the bible said he just turned
[1:20:26] stepped on the bow of the boat and said
[1:20:28] peace be still right that's controlled
[1:20:31] faith
[1:20:32] that's a faith under control because
[1:20:34] those guys that were in the boat
[1:20:36] definitely were not under control
[1:20:39] remember
[1:20:40] they were shouting how can you sleep
[1:20:41] when all this is going on well he was
[1:20:43] tired
[1:20:45] but look
[1:20:47] self-control
[1:20:50] the virtue of one who masters his
[1:20:53] desires and passions
[1:20:55] especially his sensual appetite you show
[1:20:57] all that sexual no anything your senses
[1:21:03] lean toward
[1:21:06] passions and desires
[1:21:08] self-control
[1:21:10] all right especially his sensual
[1:21:12] appetite
[1:21:13] which we used to use a lot in other
[1:21:15] things but remember
[1:21:17] we must turn this temperance
[1:21:21] to a controlled faith
[1:21:24] because what you got to do is watch this
[1:21:26] you got to say i believe i can
[1:21:32] you see what i'm talking about
[1:21:35] we come through life thinking we can
[1:21:37] i think
[1:21:39] jesus didn't think right
[1:21:41] jesus stepped upon that boat and he knew
[1:21:44] if he said what he said
[1:21:46] that the the wind and the waves had to
[1:21:48] obey what he said
[1:21:50] that was a controlled faith that was i
[1:21:53] can get up and do this because i believe
[1:21:56] i can do it right now look this is not
[1:21:58] and i i've kind of felt this last sunday
[1:22:00] and i hadn't felt it this sunday but
[1:22:02] this is not mind over matter this is not
[1:22:04] just this is not
[1:22:06] well we got to have temperance
[1:22:08] i gotta healthy self no listen it's
[1:22:11] something i'll read it to you in a
[1:22:12] minute what brother brown said about but
[1:22:13] it's something that you live out
[1:22:14] automatically
[1:22:18] automatically
[1:22:20] because you know what's going to happen
[1:22:22] god's going gonna put something in your
[1:22:23] way one day
[1:22:25] and you're gonna know whether you got it
[1:22:27] or not because it's gonna be the first
[1:22:29] thing that pops out of your mouth or
[1:22:30] your head or your desire and you're
[1:22:33] gonna say
[1:22:34] lord that was me
[1:22:36] that was not you doing it that was me
[1:22:39] doing it
[1:22:40] and so now i know then i need to have
[1:22:42] more temperance or self-control now
[1:22:46] there are things that we can do like
[1:22:47] brother madam said
[1:22:49] he said that if you're stingy what do
[1:22:52] you say do the vice versa give money
[1:22:53] away
[1:22:54] right
[1:22:57] that sounds
[1:22:58] you know that sounds too simple but it's
[1:23:00] the truth
[1:23:01] if do the vice versa same thing with
[1:23:03] self-control
[1:23:05] self-control comes from where
[1:23:07] it just tells you
[1:23:09] self
[1:23:10] self is where that control comes from it
[1:23:12] comes from you
[1:23:15] and it's look it's not listen
[1:23:18] it means that you're in control
[1:23:23] of any situation
[1:23:26] tell me one time when jesus was out of
[1:23:27] control in any situation
[1:23:30] and we're that's that's his that's his
[1:23:32] temperance right right tell me when he
[1:23:34] was in when he was out of control he
[1:23:36] said well he blatted the ropes and they
[1:23:38] went out of control he knew what he was
[1:23:39] doing
[1:23:41] it was not blind jesus never had blind
[1:23:44] anger
[1:23:46] you and i sometimes have white blind
[1:23:48] anger
[1:23:49] amen
[1:23:51] then whose is it it's yours it's not
[1:23:53] god's
[1:23:56] so i said temperance is temperance is
[1:23:57] pretty tough i told them downstairs
[1:23:59] temperance and patience really goes
[1:24:01] close together
[1:24:04] remember we'll read it in a little bit
[1:24:05] we'll read it this afternoon
[1:24:07] that by the trying of your faith
[1:24:09] produces
[1:24:10] patience and it also produces temperance
[1:24:13] because how are you going to know you
[1:24:14] got a temper unless somebody
[1:24:18] pushes the button
[1:24:19] yeah
[1:24:20] that's right brother you need to do that
[1:24:22] first because it's a hot button
[1:24:25] but look
[1:24:26] self-control go back to jesus in what he
[1:24:28] did now let's go to mark 4 and we'll
[1:24:31] read that mark 4
[1:24:33] verse 35
[1:24:35] but it's self-control brother brown says
[1:24:38] you know bathe my soul with self-control
[1:24:40] you know
[1:24:41] the same day when even was come he
[1:24:43] saying let us pass over the other side
[1:24:45] and when they had sent away the
[1:24:46] multitude they took him even as he was
[1:24:47] in the ship
[1:24:48] and there was also with him other little
[1:24:50] ships so it wasn't just one ship
[1:24:53] a bunch of ships
[1:24:55] and there arose a great storm of wind
[1:24:56] and the waves beat into the ship so that
[1:24:58] it was now full and he was in the higher
[1:25:00] part of the ship asleep on a pillar now
[1:25:02] how the world could somebody sleep
[1:25:03] during that but he was
[1:25:04] they awake him and said unto him master
[1:25:06] carest thou not that we perish they
[1:25:09] throwed it every bit on him
[1:25:14] cares not that we perish
[1:25:17] now look
[1:25:19] there's ryder lost mine
[1:25:22] not up on the boat i lost it right there
[1:25:26] i said what do you mean
[1:25:28] can y'all not handle these boats and he
[1:25:30] arose and rebuked the wind and said unto
[1:25:32] the sea peace be still and the wind
[1:25:34] ceased and there was a great calm and he
[1:25:36] said unto them why are you so fearful
[1:25:39] how is it that you have no faith
[1:25:44] and they feared exceedingly and said one
[1:25:45] to another what matter of man is this
[1:25:47] that even the wind and the sea obey him
[1:25:49] that's control and we do we lean on
[1:25:52] temper but look at that temperance as
[1:25:54] even any situation
[1:25:56] you don't have to get your dander up to
[1:25:58] be in control
[1:26:00] right
[1:26:01] watch brother branham
[1:26:02] he was in control all the time jesus
[1:26:05] all them demons
[1:26:07] watched people fleeing and running and
[1:26:08] brother branham i was reading it the
[1:26:10] other day where the maniac came to him
[1:26:12] all the preachers on the pulpit he said
[1:26:14] run off
[1:26:15] left
[1:26:16] well they surely didn't have control
[1:26:19] but brother brown stood there and he
[1:26:20] said something come from inside
[1:26:24] he said you fall at my feet
[1:26:26] right it wasn't it wasn't that man
[1:26:28] because he knew that man could knock him
[1:26:30] off there he knew the man had the
[1:26:32] ability but remember he had that
[1:26:35] controlled faith that's what i said
[1:26:36] about many things you you look at
[1:26:39] and i don't i don't disagree with
[1:26:41] preachers doing what they do but they
[1:26:43] try to build your faith up by shaking
[1:26:45] your or talking loud or
[1:26:48] jesus never did that brother branham
[1:26:50] never did that
[1:26:52] and i don't see why we should have to do
[1:26:53] that a controlled faith that demon can't
[1:26:56] have a control over you if you don't let
[1:26:58] him
[1:26:59] now if you already got one and you're
[1:27:00] talking to a demon you're in trouble
[1:27:02] remember the seven sons of escheva what
[1:27:04] happened paul we know in other words
[1:27:07] paul we feel
[1:27:09] there's something different about that
[1:27:10] man
[1:27:11] jesus we know
[1:27:14] but who are you
[1:27:16] nothing to ring nothing no control in it
[1:27:19] nothing so what happened those demons
[1:27:21] what their power overtook
[1:27:24] any power that those seven sons had same
[1:27:27] way with you and i
[1:27:28] it's like brother dale's always said you
[1:27:30] don't deal with demons either right
[1:27:32] jesus never dealt with a demon
[1:27:34] he said come out
[1:27:36] that's all he said he didn't scream at
[1:27:37] him said come out well that's to me
[1:27:39] that's controlled faith
[1:27:41] that's a controlled faith there was a
[1:27:43] control faith
[1:27:45] and there was one i want to bring it's
[1:27:47] kind of
[1:27:47] a little bit funny but some of y'all
[1:27:49] don't know him but me and dad and
[1:27:51] terence
[1:27:52] know
[1:27:52] knew of a man named coy kate
[1:27:55] a man named coy kate he come up about
[1:27:58] daddy's age and the guy could throw a
[1:28:00] baseball through those two double doors
[1:28:03] right i mean he was
[1:28:05] well known
[1:28:07] but you know what one thing his problem
[1:28:09] was
[1:28:10] he could not control his temper right
[1:28:12] he could have pitched into major leagues
[1:28:15] had he not control and i'm telling you
[1:28:16] this as an analogy but he had the power
[1:28:21] he had the power to strike out the
[1:28:23] batters
[1:28:24] but if you were to taunt him or poke fun
[1:28:27] at him he became so blindly mad till
[1:28:30] that ball didn't go across a plate it
[1:28:32] went across your forehead
[1:28:35] right so he had the power
[1:28:38] he had the ability
[1:28:40] but he didn't have the self-control
[1:28:43] to control his emotions
[1:28:46] when those things happen to him same
[1:28:48] thing with you and i be even being
[1:28:50] christians we have the power
[1:28:53] but sometimes we get muddled up in all
[1:28:55] the
[1:28:57] things of the world or whatever we get
[1:28:59] you know we get to thinking about things
[1:29:00] and and jesus said right here what's the
[1:29:02] first thing
[1:29:06] why are you so fearful right
[1:29:08] why are you fearing these things what
[1:29:10] what's the deal with this
[1:29:12] why do you have no faith
[1:29:14] what he was saying was to him he says
[1:29:16] you ain't got no faith
[1:29:18] that's what he's saying he said how is
[1:29:20] it that you have no faith he's asking
[1:29:21] him but you know what they never
[1:29:22] answered him
[1:29:25] because they didn't have nothing to
[1:29:27] answer him with
[1:29:28] now buddy on the day of pentecost
[1:29:31] put peter in that situation again i
[1:29:33] believe peter would have been the first
[1:29:34] one to stand up on the boat and say
[1:29:36] peace be still right
[1:29:37] i just believe that because he had the
[1:29:39] power
[1:29:40] plus he had the virtues working in his
[1:29:42] life
[1:29:43] like brother and i were talking another
[1:29:44] day
[1:29:45] this is not something that brother
[1:29:47] branham brought to us is halloween
[1:29:48] christian life
[1:29:50] some of you old pentecostals
[1:29:53] you lived a good christian life before
[1:29:54] you heard of brother branham right so
[1:29:56] brother adam didn't come to bring us a
[1:29:57] new way to live a christian life
[1:29:59] he come to enhance the christian life we
[1:30:02] should already be living
[1:30:03] amen
[1:30:04] let me say that one more time
[1:30:06] enhance the christian life because
[1:30:08] remember we've been living
[1:30:10] we've been living under creeds and
[1:30:12] denominations and all these things all
[1:30:14] these binding things and brother branham
[1:30:16] come to bring those loose ends together
[1:30:18] and to tie this thing up and you know
[1:30:20] what for us to be able then to go up the
[1:30:22] statue of a perfect man
[1:30:24] just like peter did because remember
[1:30:25] peter already went up this paul already
[1:30:27] went up this the first church age they
[1:30:29] were full of these people walking around
[1:30:30] that had all these virtues working in
[1:30:32] their life amen so let's go to titus
