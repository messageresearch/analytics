he bless you God is raising up another generation in case we need it raising up another generation in case we need it bringing bringing each one as they're needed not before but right when they're needed that's right bringing the young kids and giving a desire to you know if you gave them all the desire to play piano we'd have to have 50 Pian up there but it's not one gets a desire to play the drums one desire this one desire for that so we and we want to get them before the world gets we want to get them before the world gets them we'll U Lord with them maybe next Sunday we'll cover that we'll start back into the natural family and how how to uh um I'm not going to tell you how to raise your kids but maybe we can go through the prophet's message in the Bible and uh it will help you in raising your natural family I know we've all made mistakes and done things wrong but you know God never makes a mistake he as we show here even when we make mistakes it's all going to God's perfect will anyway every mistake we make is going to God's perfect will so you got your Bibles let's turn back to Isaiah 53 continue the thought with um that we were this morning on who shall declare his generation who shall declare I I know we've uh we had some discussion downstairs and thank God everybody's thinking about something at least you're not sitting there talking about football or baseball or anything he talking about the word of God and it's stirred up your pure mind and that's what I'm supposed to do I'm not supposed to give you all the an you're supposed to find something for your own sister uh Anna Mara she said I found out I was a special person that's exactly what it is that Genesis 1:26 and 27 is a special designation of God Almighty himself not a second person not a third person not another person not this over here not that over there but that is coming straight from the almighty that is eternal that's why I said that that Genesis 126 and 27 that's why I like it so much that's Purity that's Eternal that's never had a bad thought never committed adultery never sin never done anything wrong right right amen and if I start with that resurrection of that man in here right sir in this Tomb of the Earth right on Resurrection Day he'll come out and I'm not talking about the resurrection down in in this part of the earth I'm talking about Paul was talking about this Resurrection an out Resurrection the resurrection from what dead works and the things of the flesh so just keep these things in your mind if you have any more questions just feel free to ask and we uh there's a lot of lot of uh discussion going on and that's good amen discuss discuss the word of God discuss I'd rather you do that than discuss anything else and and if I said something wrong then then God will correct it somewhere the Lord will correct it even through a sister we may not like that but even through a spirit filled sister she could maybe see something that you don't see amen I hope that doesn't go wrong but that's exactly what brother R said a holy ghost fed woman can help you cuz she's filled with the same Holy Ghost you are you've just got a gift to channel it in different directions and you're able to stand here but but when what did happen in the garden that put the sisters in a different Covenant you know put in that double Covenant where she can't preach the gospel to the seed of God but she can be a help she can be a help to the seed of God she can raise those little kids that when they get the mind that if they get the mind of Christ at a young age she's done her job I read that quote the other day about that woman can help do more than the preacher in the pull pit a lot of times so so ask questions and I know there's a lot of things that that's really not clear we had to run through it we may take let brother Dale take a whole just stay in Genesis and stay in the first two or three chapters and kind of walk through it but but God he will present a way like Brother Joseph said he said he could see how that God come down and ask Adam and ask Eve what the problem was and they started passing the buck but God just said hey wait a minute serpent you started this whole thing you go and do you're I'm taking you out of the way and then he comes right back and says and woman to you this is what you're going to do your desire will now be to your husband your husband only that's right and sorrow your bare children and all that and then he'll go then he went over to Adam and said because you hearkened to what your woman what your wife said you're going to work by the sweat of your brow and you're going to die and go back to the grave but we've got a second Adam that we're going to talk about this afternoon that that Adam the first Adam was the one that put us in iniquity because he knew better he knew what he was doing and knowing to do better and doing different is Iniquity right that's a hideous sin Eve still thought she was right right on up to to bearing you know bringing Abel into the world but U Adam I believe knew I believe he had the steps that he had to take that he knew what he had to do because he was a Son of God because he was led by God this is what he done okay but he knew that if he just let her go and and let her go out that that would that would break all your types which it would break every type in the Bible but he totally typed Jesus Christ by looking I believe Adam looked down through time I just believe Adam was like a prophet he was hey Adam was the only man on Earth that's right he didn't have to go he didn't have a consultation with the preacher or the Deacon or or another prophet he was the only man he was it and God spoke to him the Bible said they spoke face to face with each other and I believe God spoke to him and and maybe put some little points in there you know how a preacher will put a point in and then 6 months later the holy spirit will Quicken it well that's kind of the way it was with Adam I believe God would tell him things and talk to him and say things to him and then when something would come up he'd go that's why God said that right cuz we're no different I mean you know he he he was a man walking upright had an ability had a knowledge you know but he was a Son of God yes we got to not you know don't belittle him and say well well he was no no he was a Son of God he knew what he was doing he knew what God had I believe he knew what he had to do to keep his lineage going on down the line all right you say well what about Abel well I was reading right here it Abel somebody ask well why Abel died well I know Abel died the reason Abel died is because God Satan was trying to kill another son of he was trying to kill that lineage he was trying to kill K that Len so he killed Abel but God just raised up Seth right brother says infallible proof then when he slew Abel he thought he got him because he destroyed the only righteous part of the seed then God raised up Seth to take his place a beautiful type of the death of Christ and the resurrection of Christ cuz when Christ died Satan thought he cut that that's why he said right here he said he says he made an offering for sin because what he who was going to declare his generation Satan knew if he could kill that man Jesus he could kill the man Jesus and nothing else would come from him he would stop a generation of the Messiah that they they said he called the Messiah that he thought he could get that stopped but what did what did God do he just raised him right back up same thing with Abel gave him Abel Abel was killed next thing you see is Seth type of Christ death be and Resurrection Seth come right back up all right so let's just go to the Lord in prayer and we'll try to finish up this afternoon de Heavenly Father we pray that you'd be with us now keep us bless the ones that are not with us Lord that you'll take care of them be with brother boy them on the way home be with Brother Dean wherever he is father and each one that are not here we ask your blessings to be upon each one but I ask you Lord especially your blessing to be upon the people here in the congregation that that we'll get something from you father and it not be a man that speak but it be the almighty come down and speak the words of eternal life to an eternal people Lord just bind us together by your spirit we condemn all the sickness and things that come upon the people that we' had requests Lord to pray for in the name of Jesus Christ we pray that that sickness will be taken away and totally annihilated because you died Lord for our transgressions you died for our sins you died for all the things Lord that that we were that was to come upon us in this age you died for each one father we pray that you'd now be with us take care of us bless the fur of this service Lord in Jesus name we pray amen who ha believed thy report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed or the word the armor of the Lord is the strength right the arm of the Lord the word of God right for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground he have no form or commonness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief we think we have a hard time yeah and we hear as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not now look that says we yeah we did that that's right we did that you say I wasn't back there we did it in our walking life and the things that we did in life this is what we did we did not think that Jesus Christ was the one who was going to save us right when we were in the world we weren't thinking about okay come on he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows quainted with grief and we hid it was our face from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely Heath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted remember um I was thinking back there sitting in a study about Kus to this man the words this man's going to die for he's going to you know have all these great people and die for these people he can't even save going to save all these people came save his house he was prophesying see but see this one could yeah the first Adam couldn't first Adam couldn't save himself but this second Adam he didn't need saving he was saving us righten he stayed on that cross for me and you he didn't stay on that cross for himself right surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him strick and smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all amen he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shears his dumb so he opened not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation qu that's the first question who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken you may be seated in the Lord I his Blessing to the reading of the word he was smitten stricken put on a cross amen but now remember let's go back and kind of and kind of review a little bit and then we'll get started we were just about we were coming out of the Old Testament because the Old Testament was a type and given to us like we showed in 1 Corinthians 10:1 that they were given for our example for whom the ends of the world come upon so that whatever happened in the Old Testament that was for our example but now see that wasn't our perfect example cuzz David wasn't our perfect example if you followed David's life it was a perfect example when he was in The Book of Psalms and when he was doing the thing singing the songs of God but when he when he saw a beautiful woman and he lusted after her and he and he had his best friend killed and committed adultery that didn't that's not in the Christian attitude or the Christian way right so we can't type oursel totally with David we can't type oursel totally with even Abraham he was the father of our faith but we're supposed to look at what he was believing in that's right all right because remember he gave his wife away a couple of times if we did that then we'd be in big trouble so you can't say everything is a perfect type but they are examples there are examples for whom the end of the world is come upon so you and I are supposed to look back we're supposed to look down through time and see all those examples using those examples to live by cuz they live that life under the blood of bulls and goats they live that life under an anointing that would come upon a uh um Nathan or or Samuel or any of those prophets but you know what you watch what these prophets in the Old Testament had today they killed a lot of people they K they literally killed well look what Elijah did th 300 of them down there and killed them all okay Samuel yes remember when Saul took the two kings and Samuel said you got to destroy every one of them he said I hear the blatant of the sheep he walks in and finds the King two kings like king of a I think and the other one Samuel all Samuel does is he said Saul he said I got a problem with this and he just pull a sa sword and he just whacks her head off right that's right that's right because the word of God told him to tell Saul kill them all kill all of them all like daddy said before you know you you see the God tell them to go in and say Smite all the the the he jebusites and kill them all well few chapters later you find out that they didn't do exactly what God said because they started fighting the same people again all right same thing with you and I if we don't cut sin off then it just going going to keep coming up yeah we going to have to kill the same I IES are going to come up and we're going to have to kill them off that's right but in 1 Corinthians 10:1 he says that they were given for our example all right and then I in Psalms 139 verse 13-16 he talks about incontinence see we had to be brought some way what I was saying about Adam we can get into the details but but Adam had to preserve a place for that Genesis 126 and 27 to fall a lineage cuz Jesus don't have a natural lineage Adam had a natural natural lineage it went from the Old Testament right on down to the New Testament and right on out to us because we were born in continuance and the lower parts of the Earth the Bible says we were fashioned what in our mom and daddy right just to be real in the womb of your mother you were fashioned you were formed that's where it all started naturally but when we come out then we know that I believe Adam knew that that there had to be one come cuz that Genesis 1:26 had to come the way that was supposed to come by Spoken Word exactly I believe Adam knew that but he knew that that couldn't happen once what happened to Eve it couldn't happen the way it was supposed to so he had to he played the part of Christ right yeah yes he said I will accept her sin ain't that what Christ come to do he come to what not be a sinner that's right but he come to take on my sin to make him sinful that's right make it sinful like you know brother Gerald Hughes was preaching there's a fine line there Jesus did not commit sin that's right but he took on the sin that we had right what did Adam do Adam committed iniquity by take by saying by doing what he was supposed not supposed to do but then he comes and he says hey whatever she's done I'll be a part of it and that's what Jesus done in all of your fallacies and all of your impurities God comes down and says I'm going to take on their sin yeah but see he had the goods he had the goods to bring us out Adam didn't have the goods to bring us out Adam couldn't say destroy this body and in 3 days I'll raise it back up but when Jesus come he had the ability to say in 3 days I'll raise this body back up all right that's what I mean in the resurrection he saw more of himself right because he couldn't see it in the Old Testament Saints you can't you can see types or examples of Christ but you don't see Christ himself in the people living daily lives being lost and then coming to no they were a Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph I believe they were human beings remember Moses he could kill an Egyptian right but when God came down over that man and anointed him they had to cover his face cuz it shown so much him and God were so much together on on on his part of his mission till they Moses was their God right that's right but now remember what a lot of things Moses did that was not good that's right okay but so you take Moses for an example of the things that he did that he could talk to God and he could do the things of God and he could lead a group of people but remember he was a murderer yeah and it's like somebody said one time said well you really you really never see Moses asking forgiveness for that he never ask forgiveness for being a murderer you it's not recorded but you come over there when Moses had to stand in the gap for a group of people see there was there was Mo I there was Christ again saying all right whatever they done account it to me so if you but if you're going to kill them you got to kill me so God couldn't do this to get to Israel he had to kill Moses Moses was his anointed Prophet for the day God couldn't kill Moses so God couldn't kill Adam God couldn't kill uh Abraham because Abraham and Sarah were under that Covenant now where Abraham was the head and Sarah was underneath don't don't get off what we've been talking about cuz you're protected by by your husband right your husband's going to have to give an account for you but you're not going to have to give an account for your husband see God didn't curse Eve right he didn't curse Adam but he didn't say well Eve now you you know you just you're no he give he give a position right he give Eve a position he said okay for what you done you're going to have to be under your head which is your husband cuz you're the one that partook of this thing first and then you give it to your husband but in that your husband accepted that this is what's you're going to have to die amen Christ the same way he accepted our sin that's why he had to die yes right yes everybody that okay everybody understand that that's all right okay so now let's go and start in Galatians well Isaiah 53:10 we talked about we can start right that's okay brother Jo leave it there but remember in verse 10 it says yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he has put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin see there was offerings down through the Old Testament that were made by animals millions and millions of animals died to cover right to keep God from killing the people right it covered them made a covering a blood covering yes but that man would come in and we were talking downstairs remember not everybody in the Old Testament when I say the Old Testament I don't mean just what was written down on paper cuz a lot of other people Liv during the Old Testament that never got written in the old in everybody understand that that's right that's right if they believed in that blood sacrifice I believe they'll be in heaven right amen am but now if they just did like what Dad said you just walk up and it become a ritual and you just say here kill this animal they went to hell they didn't go to paradise right they but they believed in that blood sacrifice right they believed in it so much till they actually said transfer my sins onto this animal well the animal couldn't take the sin though and speak back and say no I'll receive your sin no God said hey we're going to take this animal life and it's just going to cover you but one day I'm going to come back see to the woman I'm going to come back and when that sin dumped on me I'm going to be able to it's going like I told him downstairs when it went on that animal it just made that animal dead when it went on Jesus Christ it just went through and it just filtered out and eradicated it right amen it didn't stay there it didn't linger around man it was a bloody place I'm sure we always think it's just a all that Temple was probably so clean could you imagine the millions of sacrifices they did they had to take the inals and do this with it and they had to take the fat and do this with it it was not a pretty sight a type of Jesus hanging on the cross just like we read in Isaiah 53 look like hamburger meat well if you were to walk out and look out into the court and see them with the Laver and the golden all these things the Golden Ladder and all the things that they were killing these sacrifices it look like a slaughter house right blood everywhere exactly didn't look pretty it wasn't a pretty sight so if I was a man with a good conscience and I walked in and I looked at that and I thought my God my sins did this to this animal I would have a sin Consciousness to ask God to forgive me but the problem with the Old Testament was is I would do that and I would start feeling good and then about two months later yeah that old self that old adamic nature was still there that's right and it caused me to do the same thing that I did before but God made that atonement so they can go back and forth and they could do those things amen but when you take a a God that comes down and takes and eradicates that sin takes that sin and does away with it and then you then you despise that sacrifice see you've turned down the Living God right you've turned down the very soul of God all right so let's read here in Galatians 3 and start right here will you read that let me finish this you made an offering for sin why he shall see his seed what is his seed seed means progeny or genealogy our genetics he was cut off the question was in verse 8 who shall declare his generation right in other words see Josh declares My Generation he declares my next Generation because he came from me then when he has a son his son will declare his generation but what happened was here the way they're reading the scriptures Isaiah is going my goodness this guy's going to be slaughtered and who's going to declare his generation this guy's supposed to be the Messiah he's supposed to be the one that saves everything right and who's going to declare his generation right well there's nobody from Adam to Isaiah I mean from yeah from Adam to Isaiah and on up to Jesus that could do that right amen they could only look forward to something they couldn't look and see that that that man had come and made an offering for sin himself a human man all right had made a sacrifice all right so now he shall see his seed his seed which is what him made manifest in another form exactly okay right now Galatians 3 now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made he saith not into seeds as of many in other words not all the seeds of Abraham right but as of one into thy seed which is Christ Christ is the one go back to that Genesis 1: 126 and 27 where we're at this morning there's the one seed but it's one seed but you plant that one seed that seed had to go on the ground right plant that one seed it brings out a tree that's got many many multiple fruits on it right so from one seed comes all things from God and then remember we talked about God loving Israel and Israel defiled him but in Daniel 9 we know that he's bringing that back but see that's still not Genesis 1:26 nothing in the Old Testament is talking about Genesis 1 26 and 27 they are something is pointing to example because remember they're given to us and us that are seed in the end time and even down through seven Church ages we all were the the seed of God are the seed of God and we're looking at that example that was down through the Old Testament right that's what we were looking at we're looking at that that one seed which is Christ all right now look let's go to First Timothy 1 and I the Lord really was gracious this morning cuz we read the wrong scripture and it fit right in I ain't telling you whose fault it was but there's no fault they put 1 Timothy 4:4 and we read 1 Timothy 4:4 and it fit right in you didn't know it was a wrong scripture but I was talking about analy genealogy well listen 1 Timothy 1 4 through1 neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies now what's Paul telling them quit doing this so and so but got so and so and so and so but got so and so just because you come from you know they stood up and they said well we're Abraham's seed or where where're from you know we're Moses's children Jesus kept telling them said you're dead right they're dead what they're seed they're dead right now the end of the Commandment is Charity oh wait a minute neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies right which minister questions rather than Godly edifying which is in faith so do now the end of the Commandment is Charity out of a pure heart and of a good conscience and a faith unfe right from which some having swerved have turned aside into vain jangling Desiring to be teachers of the law remember we're back in Paul's time now but remember that comes up to this age too Desiring to be teachers of the law which the message is law until you see the grace anything's law that's right it's like it's like D's always said you're under law until you until you're born again amen exactly cu there's your condemnation right all right the law can't save you that's right law didn't save a soul in the Old Testament didn't save a person as far as New Birth salvation now it did save them and put them in a position in heaven right yeah right I'm that's what I'm trying to say I said this in another church and they questioned it but the Old Testament I'm not saying they were lost right they're not lost it's just like I said if you went in and made a sacrifice and you truly believe that that sacrif rice was for you and for your sins God forgive you right and if you died you went to Paradise but now you couldn't go in the presence of God you had to go to another place called Paradise cuz remember Jesus emptied Paradise out when he went into Glory so the law the law is carnal and all these things but the law is also spiritual that's right cuz from the law Paul wrote most of the New Testament from the Old Testament right all right remember what did Paul took the SC for about 14 years Wonder or three four five years he went to Egypt took the Old Testament Scrolls and wrote 80% of the New Testament out of it but we know that the law is good wait a minute Desiring to be teachers of the law understanding neither what they say no wherefore they affirm in other words just blabber it out but we know that the law is good right if a man use it lawfully that's right knowing this that the law is not made for a righteous man amen right there it is law is not made for somebody's born again right right but for the Lawless and the disobedient for the ungodly and for Sinners we are Unholy and profane murders and fathers and it just keeps getting worse and worse murders of mothers manslayers wh mongers for them that defile themselves of mankind men Stealers Liars perjured persons and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound Doctrine Paul just put it all in there but look the law is good if a man use it lawfully amen all right so we're not doing away with the law but the law was given because of what transgression we'll read that in just a little bit the blood of an animal just covered it but the curse of the law no one was able to live by it that was the curse the curse of the law was death there was no Grace that's right you just either did it or you didn't do it all right there was no Grace it was all condemnation now let's go to number quote number five who it was this morning perfection so therefore when Adam and Eve had sinned and had transgressed the law they were subjects of death and the law had to be executed Jesus told him well when I say Jesus Christ the Creator told him this therefore it put all the human race under the penalty of death every man and woman child is included in the penalty of death by the transgression of the head of the human race which was Adam by his transgression every one of us fell victim to sin right and sin must be dead dealt with so God in his great infamy and his great love the law was to separate the sinner from his maker y then he become annihilated and totally annihilated no way for him to come back there was no way that that if you read in you we can't just we can't stop you can just keep reading in the New Testament where the the comer you know if he was to go to I think we got it we'll just wait let's go to quote number six I don't want to I don't want to misquote it I think I got it in Scripture God's chosen place of work worship not that the law could help them but the law only pointed out to them that they were wrong or Sinners until that time they didn't know what sin was so they had a law there cannot be a law without a penalty a law is not not a law without a penalty so therefore the transgression of the law is sin and the wages of sin is death now let's go to Romans 4 verse 12 and the father of circumcision to them who are not of circumcision only but who also walk in the steps of that Faith of Our Father Abraham which he had been yet uncircumcised for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to Abraham right are to his seed through the law exactly but through the righteousness of Faith amen for if they which are of the LW beair faith is made void in other words if your dos and don'ts get you into Heaven there's nothing to do with faith you don't have nothing to do with faith right right right and the promise made of none effect what is the promise gift of the Holy Ghost yeah promises to you and your children then they're far off because the law worketh wrath for where no law is there is no transgression therefore it is of faith that it might be by Grace amen amen to the end of the promise might be sure to all the seed right Glory us the seed right the seed of God not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all amen but see now look let's go to Hebrews 10 the law doesn't declare the generations of God the law declared the generations of Adam the generations of people the people that live right that come from Ham sham and that came back to Adam and Seth and and Methuselah and all the way Enoch and all the way on down right that was the law the law doesn't declare the generations of God grace declares the generation of God cuz we were all born under sin shaping in iniquity but watch Hebrews 10 for the law having a shadow of good things to come not the very image of the things so it wasn't the image it was an example or a shadow all right can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the C there unto perfect now it covered his sin and put him in heaven but it didn't make him perfect right all right for then would they not have ceased to be offered right there'd be a time somewhere where you'd make the last sacrifice and you'd be perfect that's what it was saying but there's no way that can happen right not under the law right right amen for then would they have then would they not have ceased to be offered question because that the worshipper once purged should have had no more conscience of sin amen right in other words one year boom done finished that's not the law the law condemned you every year that's right amen but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sin every year in other words when you you know you knew the time was coming you started remembering all those sins back through the year righten you see what Satan's doing to us he's making it but that's right you're going to see that that's that should be gone that's right but in those sacrifices there's a remembrance again made of sins every year for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sin right can't take away sin exactly but now look let's go to Hebrews 105 wherefore when he cometh into the world he sayth sacrifice and offerings thou wouldest not but a body hast thou prepared me a body thou Hast prepared me who built the body for Jesus to come to amen the prophets yeah let's go to quote number seven the word and the prophet and then came finally the great head the head of all of it the rest of the body just spoke of it the foundation was laid by the patriarch but the body was built by the word which was the prophets and here comes the head of it all Jesus come on the scene there when his headpiece was put upon it we find in him the entire handiwork of God we find in him the perfect reflection of the word for he was the word amen the fullness of the word now again God has the perfect Masterpiece again what the fullness of the word as Isaiah said behold my servant my masterpiece that I have portrayed through all the ages of this perfect one coming and and here he stands right here before me a perfect there in his own image reflecting God for he said in St John 14 when you see me you've seen the father so now let's bring remember even with Jesus on the earth still the Earth is cursed right Adam's race is still on the Earth right nothing really changes on the earth yeah right right and Adam all di when Jesus died even when he resurrected they still had funerals we've been still having funerals for 2,000 years right but where did the work begin it's like what brother Daniel said the work began inside this is a secret work all right Genesis 3:15 and I will put enity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed right and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel the promise of a seed coming amen her seed the woman's seed seed of the woman which is who Jesus Christ Galatians 3 and the law is not of Faith the man but the man that doeth them shall live in them right no words man do the law she live in the law Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law amen what was the curse of the law death that's right being made a curse for us right for it is WR and cursed is everyone that HTH on a tree that the blessings of Abraham might come on the Gentiles this is us through Christ Jesus that we we might receive the what promise of the the promise of the spirit through faith Brethren I speak after the manner of men though it be but a man's Covenant yet if it be confirmed right no man dis knowledge or added to amen now Abraham and his seed were the promises made he set not the seeds of the many but the one what that one man confirmed the Covenant right Christ that's right not Abraham they made a covenant with Abraham but but Abraham didn't fulfill the whole Covenant the circumcision was a type that's right we supposed to have the promise of circumcision in the heart amen that's the promise the promise wasn't because Abraham died Abraham died and then there was another one and he died then there was another one and he died what that was natural those Jews could say hey we're part of the promise right sure let's just be honest you can take them behind the building and show them that they were circumcised so they're they're in the Covenant right yeah they can show it that's why when we're circumcised by the Holy Ghost we're supposed to be able to show it we're supposed to be able to show that we're circumcised not naturally but spiritually all the flesh has been cut away right but they could show them they could show them hey this is what we're hanging on we're hanging on this that Abraham had a covenant that he was circumcised and that circumcision put us in that Covenant right made us God's chosen people amen but when the one that made the Covenant came remember when Jesus come before him he said you got a cloak had a cloak for your sins but now you have one right I'm I'm the one that made the Covenant I'm the one that's doing it and it's one seed which is Christ and I'm the one that's doing it so now things have got to what things got to change things got to change Galatians 4 to redeem them that were under the law Christ came that we might receive the adoption of sons and because you are Sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying ABA father to redeem them that were under the law right now look answer the phone Galatians 4 to redeem them that were under the law so we were under the law till Christ come right all right so now that's why that the New Testament didn't begin until the book of Acts right cuz Matthew Mark Luke and John was a commentary of Jesus's life under the law he was born under the law to what to redeem them that were under the law amen all right he come to get us out of the law thank you Jesus who was he John 1 this is him right here in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God exactly the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made verse 14 and the Word was made flesh right the seed was made flesh amen seed is the word right and the seed was made I'm not changing am I cuz the Bible says we're going to read it in a little bit where the Bible says that the seed of God is the word of God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father right begotten of the father right full of grace and truth right this was Jesus Christ amen now we got to move over into his time now right Revelations 3:14 and to the angel of Church of the L of sin see this is a special message to us amen right not the other ages this is a special message to us because we must realize what part of the creation we're at or we're from right yeah Luther didn't really have to he had to understand where he was at but you and I have got to understand that the beginning of the creation of God and if we're the rest of that creation where are the back end of that creation the last of it right amen yeah there there's no other age right there's nobody going to be G people will be given eternal life at the white Throne judgment that's foolish virgins that's people not in the body we're talking about God's people God's children God's family we're it amen and to the angel of the Church of the layout of sins right these things sayith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God when Jesus Christ came the prophet said when Jesus Christ came that was the beginning that's the way God wanted it in the beginning exactly God wanted that to be that way in the beginning that's right what egg and germ spoken into existence in a womb baby comes forth okay but now look nobody could receive eternal life in their soul until the possessor of that book came back that's right that's right you never saw there there was no commentary in the book of the Old Testament that's right of a book of life right or written in the book right right right you do it in the New Testament that's right but not in the old cuz this book disappeared this book was Jehovah God Amen a father with his family but there was no way to get his family out because remember he had to close the book right see seal it up that's right y even in Daniel it talks about sealing of the book until what time of the end right so he sealed the book back up and there was only one kid born out of that book Adam and he wasn't born he was given eternal life but he was a Son of God he didn't have eternal life in his soul the way God wanted it but he wanted children so the family album was sealed up put back in the hands of god Jehovah right he held on to it and he get he gave permissive will down through the Old Testament right that's right he allowed Isaiah and Jeremiah but he was telling Isaiah and Jeremiah what to say yes right so you still we're still being born by the spoken word amen we're still listening to what God wanted to begin with he wanted to talk to us yes I told him up in um up in U Virginia we were talking about text messaging and I just have got started where I can just barely you ought to see some of the textes i s you have to erase them every once in a while cuz you hit the wrong button but I told him I said you know what God thought so much of us he didn't just send it in the air wve he sent us a text message he wrote it down send it to us then he sent us 1160 more right that clarified the first one he sent the 66 books he sent he sent us 1100 sermon to clarify what this said right but the book was closed y the testator the one that held the Testament and testament means Covenant right the one that holds the Covenant had to die yes to release it back to us that's right right that's right that's why they had to be the death of a testator amen the testator had to die sure to release the book right that is a new testament right the Old Testament or the old Covenant started when God slayed the lamb and give it the Skins to Adam and Eve that was really the first testament that was the Old Testament where they were covered the New Testament or the death of the testator a person not a lamb a person a person died that's why he gave his soul a ransom amen the goats can't give their soul a ransom the lamb can't give their soul a ransom but man can say in Genesis 3 I'll put enmity in other words I can't believe I can't get you to do it so I'm going to do it right my own self that's right cuz I'm the only one that holds a book right this is the book of eternal life right amen eternal life is in this book right here right this is what we feed off of right here right all right so the man that had this book held on to it right let's look at quote number eight L out to see in church age but but now he is standing in the midst of the church as he stands there revealing who he is in this last age he calls himself the author of the creation of God Amen this is another creation Glory this has to do with the church right this is a special designation of himself now I know that he started letting that Genesis 126 out he started opening this book a little bit on the day of Pentecost 120 in the upper room then 3,000 downstairs sure he was letting a little bit out at at a time a little bit a little bit a little bit but when it comes down to us it's supposed to be the whole book right John didn't say eat three Pages out of the book John said the angel told him to eat the whole book all right so we got to eat the whole book this is another creation let's be honest with ourselves you think you're special sister this whole creation's waiting on the people that are still alive to get them out of the ground right this is another creation this has to do with the church this is a special designation of himself right he is the creator of that church exactly the Heavenly bridegroom created his own bride amen as the spirit of God he came down and created in the Virgin Mary the cells from which his body was born I want to repeat that he created the very CS in the womb of Mary for that body it was not enough for the Holy Spirit to Simply give life to a human oam supplied by Mary that would have been sinful mankind producing the body Adam's race Adam's race everybody get that right this had to be another creation a special designation of himself not using the old creation not using it cuz it was dead amen now we know God can take life out of death but this was dead right he' already cursed this part exactly he couldn't take that curse off either until he did something wait he couldn't do it but watch cuz remember we got to realize that when he came out of that grave he took that curse off but we got to take that pardon we got to accept that pardon Jesus signed my pardon this I surely know that day he died at Calvary so that I didn't have to go right as the spirit of God he came down and created in the Virgin Mary the cells from which his body was born I want to repeat that he created the very cells in the womb of Mary for that body what was that spoken word there's the Original Seed all right it was not enough for the Holy Spirit to Simply give life to a human oam supplied by Mary that would have been sinful mankind producing a body right right that would not have produced the last atam what's he saying the first Adam produced death right the last Adam produced life okay of him it was said low a body H has now father prepared for me we read that a minute ago God not Mary provided that body Mary was the human incubator and she carried that holy child and brought him to birth it was a God man he was the son of God he was of the new creation that's why he didn't need a new birth right that's why he told Nicodemus which was born under Adam's race he said you need a new birth you need to be born again so Nicodemus gets carnal and says do I have he knew where he came from the first time right and he was getting pretty old that's right so he knew where he was coming from he said you may not got to Jesus said you got to be born from above that's right amen not down here this is earthy read that we're not going to have time to read that I wanted to read it but read there in Corinthians where it talks about the earthy the first man Earth he the first man Adam all right read about that he was of the new creation man and God met and joined he was the first of this new race do you know what man has been looking for a perfect race since the dawn of time why do you think of all this uh ethic cleansing that goes on in all these countries never know it could have went on here in the United States but they were trying to make Hitler was trying to produce a super race that's right why it's the pull they feel that's right they know there's a new race that's going to inhabit this Earth and you some of these movies you just watch some of them you say Well they're trying to get what God's already said we were going to do but they're trying to get it carnal all right he was the first of this new race he is the head of this new race Colossians 11:18 he is the head of the body of the church who is the beginning the first born from the dead so he was the first one up that in all things he might have the preeminence 2 Corinthians 5:17 therefore for any man be in Christ he is a new creation old old things have passed away behold all things are become new there you can see that though man was of the old order adamic right old order or creation Now in Union with Christ he has become the new creation of God Ephesians 2:10 for we are his workmanship created in Union with Christ Jesus unto good words Ephesians 4:24 and that you put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true Holiness this new creation is not the old creation made over amen he's going to change you in your atoms Glory you're going to be changed your genetic makeup yeah you may keep the same features that you have right and you will blacks will be blacks whites will be whites different different color hair right all them will be different but but what God done is God took that picture of you when you were in your Prime of Life yeah let me tell you something God thought so much of you till brother R even says he took this one and bred them to this one this one to this one this one to this one this one this one to get you here he watched the whole thing come down through time and you know what he's not looking at your neighbor that way your neighbor just came because a man and a woman got together one day right that's right right that's right but when you come here and you have the new birth and you become a part of this new creation this new creation of God glory that takes all genetics out of the way now there's certain things that you can that you're you know like me I'm I love to hunt I love to talk that God didn't take that away he just tries to use it I said tries he tries to use it for his good all right that's exactly what it says this new creation is not the old creation made over or it wouldn't be called a new creation that's right this is exactly what it says it is New Creation right it is another creation distinct from the old one that's right separate no longer is he dealing by ways of the flesh that's how he dealt with Israel Adam's race coming right down through time all right he chose Abraham and of Abraham's issue Through The Godly Isaac Lon but now out of every Kindred tribe and Nation he has purposed a new creation he is the first of that creation he was God created in the form of man now by his Spirit he is creating many sons unto himself God the Creator creating himself a part of his creation Hallelujah one more time God the Creator the one that created all things created himself a part of his own what Genesis 1:26 if that ain't got Genesis 126 wrote all over it amen there's not a quote in the in the message that's right if fact don't have Genesis 1 written all over that is what he done he took a part of himself put it aside right here wrote it in a book A book of names and he said this is going to be my children I'm going to start with him but he's not going to be able to he's not going to be able to finish it but I'm going to finish it hey the one that wrote it the one that created it is the one that's going to finish it Glory all right exactly and that way there's no mistakes we make mistakes but in this Godly line in that Godly creation there's no mistakes in there we're not going to get in we're not going to get in and not have our name written in that book that's right now by his Spirit he is creating many sons unto himself God the Creator creating himself a part of his creation this is the true revelation of God Amen this was his purpose from geneses this was his purpose this purpose took form through election that is why he look right down to the last age when all would be over right this is a long quote but I like it and see himself still in the midst of the church as author of this new creation of God his Sovereign power brought it to pass by his own decree he elected the members of this new creation Genesis 1:26 and 27 he predestinated them to the adoption of children according to the good pleasure of his will by his omniscience and omnipotence he brought it to pass how else could he know that he would be standing in the midst of the church receiving Glory from his Brethren if he did not make sure right all things he knew and all things he worked out according to what he knew in order that his purpose and good pleasure be brought to pass Ephesians 2:1 whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of his will who worketh all things after the Council of his own will Hallelujah aren't you glad you belong to him who's him Christ Jesus right so he started his family now we got to hurry in this man this creation right in this man was all the genetic strain of God right amen right where did the body come from somebody say it where' the body come from a body thou has prepared me that's right the Father the Creator the Creator created himself on and it says right here the Creator created him his own self he didn't create himself he created himself in creation all right so he produced the body no genetics on the earth none none whatsoever right made sure that by both egg and and and germ being created he has no ties to this race that's why he's the beginning of the creation of God cuz that's the way God wanted it to start with all right now look go to Matthew 13:37 here I want you to see something he is not only cuz remember we read in the beginning was the word right amen he's not only the S but he's the seed that's right sure amen that's right he's going to make sure that's right he's going to make sure he's the SE cuz remember what's the seed the word in the beginning was the word was with and the Word was so it's both the so and the seed how can he lose he's not going to that's right amen he answered and said unto them he that sth the good seed is the son of man that was God in human flesh that's that new creation right there okay right that's the new creation the son of man God in human flesh that's the the new creation the start of it all right Luke 8:1 now the parable is this the seed is the word of God I kind of broke these it's the same one but it's in two different two different U chapters here now the parable is this the seed is the word of God so what is the seed word of God what's the sword son of man all right right so now he preached the word but now look he didn't have have any genetic children Earthly that's right Jesus that's why the Bible says who can declare this generation there's no seed right there's no natural genetics that's why them priests they you know they they could pass their lineage back 500 generation clean as a pen and here comes this man walks up he ain't got a wife that's right they said he was illegitimate born and here he walks up in the temple and he starts talking about having these children and having this Kingdom and having this this and have hey buddy who's declaring your generation my daddy declared mine and he said yeah your daddy did not your natural daddy right your daddy's declaring your generation for sure that's what he was saying but they said and said look where's your genealogy where's your we not be born of fornication like you cuz that fornication cut cut his lineage off really cuz you couldn't go into the temple if you were if you committed fornication or committed adultery and had a bastor job it took 400 years to get that out so they knew he' cut himself off if he was born illegitimate cuz that's what they were saying he's born illegitimate that's what they said so that cut him off from everything so they were looking at a man and he was totally powerless to them really to look for for the Pharisees and Sadducees to look at Jesus here come this man that walks up he can't even go in the temple for 400 years he ain't got a wife he ain't got no children and here he talks about having all these young on and having this and having that you must be born again and you must be this you must be that a swer Goes Forth and sews a seed that's right the children of the Kingdom he said Children of the Kingdom you don't even have a wife yeah so they thought he was totally cut off they just didn't realize it wasn't by sex anymore it wasn't by what man would see a woman and man get together and have this generation a woman and man to get together and have this generation he was the generation the beginning of the generation of God he was the beginning of the reging of the Earth the right way that's right right right yeah yeah but where was his life his life was in his blood right right right right the life of the blood of the animals in the Old Testament couldn't come back onto the believer and make them different that's right right but this man had the life eternal life in him now let's read one quote right here and then I want to go to Hebrews 9 and read that the law having a shadow he said on man all on own goodness all on work no Grace you see all on goodness what a man can do if a man can if a man lives good enough to that he'd be God himself if he could live good enough if a man lives good enough he'd be God himself if he could live good enough I said look life lays in the blood cell and without the shedding of blood there's no remission of sin right innocent substitute has to take a guilty Sinner's Place y oh I want you to get this now notice an innocent substitute must take the guilty one's place and it happened in Eden that same way right right that's when Adam sinned he cut off his fellowship with God the father and when he had sinned before he could stand before God God had to kill some sheep perhaps whatever it was and make a covering blood had to be offered in substance because the Bloods were life lays and God required life at sin amen now let's read what this man Jesus we kind of running through here quick that was quote number nine all right listen to this without the shedding of blood there was no remission of sin the law having a shadow of good things to come every lamb that died under the law was pointing to the Lamb of God at Calvary and through the power of the resurrection of deity itself pretty powerful that ain't an animal right and through the power of the resurrection of deity itself raised up his body for it was not possible that it should be a holder of it for David said in the spirit I not leave my Holy One see corruption neither will I leave his soul in hell so he rose up on the on the third day for our justification promising the promise of the father I'll send the Holy Ghost upon you which will abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth who the world cannot receive and tonight the Blessed holy spirit is in this building tonight in the power of the resurrection of the anti Tite of every lamb that died even from the Garden of Eden Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Christ dying for Sinners dying for sickness God be blessed forever for his mercy and his goodness now let's go to Hebrews 9 I want to read this right here and listen to all the words of this scripture I Circle this in my Bible a long time ago listen to this but Christ being coming high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle what the one not made with hands the one that was God Almighty amen not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of bull of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy Place having obtained and I Circle this word Eternal blood of bulls and goats doesn't give you Eternal anything but this man shedding his blood having obtained Eternal Redemption for us that's we're not finished for if the blood of bulls and ghosts and the ashes of heer sprinkled the unclean sanctify to the purifying of the Flesh in other words if all that Sanctified you how much more shall the blood of Christ who threw the Eternal our underline all these Eternal eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscious from dead Works to serve the Living God how much more should this blood and for this cause he is a mediator of the New Testament that by means of death so the New Testament could have not be begun until after he died cuz you're still under the old order the old blood of bulls and goat he had to shed his blood to make a new testament the death of the testator and for this cause he is the mediator of the New Testament that by means of death for the Redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament what the Old Testament they which are called might receive the promise of Eternal how many more times we want to say is inheritance for where a testament is our covenant same thing for where a testament is there must also of necessity be the death of the testator for a testament is a force after men are dead okay otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth Christ was born under the law yes right every every time he would do something in the in the in the Matthew Mark Luke and John he'd tell them go do the law of Moses go do the purification go do the and he was in the temple for a lot of those things himself he was there why he was born under the law right amen he didn't make himself any better than anybody else right every time they had those feasts and those days Jesus was in that Temple amen right he went to church right pray testimony of force after men are dead otherwise it is no strength all while the testator liveth whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood it wasn't because remember God did what he did in the old first of the Old Testament for when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of Cavs and of goats with water Scarlet wool HS up sprinkled both book both the book and all the people saying this is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you moreover he sprinkled with blood both the Tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry and almost all all things that are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood there's no remission amen so without shedding of blood there's no remission of sin right all right so this is Elementary but it's bringing to view what Christ actually did right why this Resurrection had to happen and we're going to have to go a little bit longer today to get into get to the resurrection are we going to have him resurrecting on a on a Monday yeah all right Matthew 26 this is in the upper room this is the last thing Jesus did before he went to Gethsemane and as they were eating Jesus Took bread and blessed it and break it and gave it to the disciples said take eat this is my body and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it for this is my blood of the New Testament people in the message would just read the Bible That's Right ouch right brother deck ouch if I just read Bible right the Bible will explain it to you that don't really take a revelation for this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sin 50 days later started the New Testament right cuz when he remember he died close to it but when he died remember that he resurrected was here 40 days and he said in 10 more days at day of Pentecost 50 days later the day of Pentecost is when the New Testament began be can't right began to happen all right cuz what he done his blood is shed what he took all the sins away and he said I'm going to send back a comforter he'd already told him that I got to hurry so now let's go to John 12 verse 23 Jesus answered them saying the hour has come the son of man should be glorified I want you to look at that word this this is going this is toward the end all right this is heading toward the end of his life and Jesus answered them saying the hour has come that the son of man should be glorified remember that I'll come back to it in just a second ver verely I say unto you except a corn of wheat fall in the ground and die one grain a corn of wheat it abideth alone but if it die it bring forth much fruit what I'm theine you and the branches read the whole read Matthew AR look and John right he that loveth life shall lose it he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal and if any man serve me let him follow me where I am there shall also my servant be and if any man serve me him will my father honor now is my soul troubled right remember he gave his soul a ransom right when he sees the travail of his soul he'll see his seed all right he speaks into just a few days later he he's fixing to 50 days later he's fixing to see his seed come forth now is my soul troubled and what shall I say father save me from this hour but for this cause came I unto this hour now go to John 739 but this he spake of the spirit this is Jesus talking about uh something and then this is where you get your where John comes in and puts in parentheses but this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus has not yet was not yet glorified what did he just say there in John 12 talking about glorify he's getting ready to the glory of Jesus is what him dying shedding his life and getting his kids out that's the glory and that's why that there's the Holy Ghost was not given to anybody in a new birth form right amen until the day of Pentecost the Bible proves it I don't have to just sit up here and make quotes and make statements the Bible proves it that's the two points I wanted to prove today number one about what happened in the garden and number two about this many people believe that that uh that they had the new birth like we did or the Holy Ghost like we did in the Old Testament there's no way they could have right their sins were only covered their sins weren't done away with right it was only covered but Jesus look at Matthew 20:28 we'll be all right even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many amen now how did he give his life died on the cross couple days ago 2,000 years ago right but now he gave his life a ransom so where did he go he went to hell preached to the people in hell right was an animal this was the soul of a man exactly this was the soul of the man amen this was the soul of the Eternal man look at all those eternals that was in there in the book of uh John when we read it there I believe it was no Hebrews 9: 11-22 everything about this man was eternal you said well his body was dying yeah his body was dying because he was born in under the law right he's born out of the curse but he wasn't born out of this cursed earth right exactly but remember at Calvary when his blood gripped down on the earth he cleansed and claimed every one of you sitting here today exactly he was claiming his new creation Glory his new race was being claimed at Calvary yeah amen he claimed you right Sanctified you and you weren't even nowhere around right thank you Jesus God's Eternal Word is going to make itself manifest whether we want to or not it's our decision whether we want to hook up to it or not it's our decision whether like brother Brown said we we've come down here to make our choice right God's going to have a bride God's going to have a new creation but he wants us to be able to make a choice to say we chose that and then him come back and say yes I'm the one that chose you right right right cuz that's what it's got to come back he's got to speak back say yes I chose you thank you're the one that I chose I'm just glad you're beginning to realize all right so now let's go back to Isaiah 53 just for a second he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation right so who's going to declare this declares Generation Mr Anna kamani I mean Anna mura yeah said me that's yeah so we're fulfilling scripture right there just is Genesis 1 is special to me so is this statement who shall declare Isaiah wanted somebody under the anointing Isaiah said who is going to declare this righteous man's generation somebody has got to stand up and declare his generation in other words somebody has got to come from this man to declare the generation cuz Adam's generation was declared all the way down Abel Seth and all the way down he declared that I see it right here but he's declared this should I say New Generation right right this new creation of a generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living they killed him right they thought they got him he was done didn't have a wife didn't have kids he defiled the temple every time he walked in it they thought because he was born they said a bastard child we know he wasn't but even cathic then he said hey this man wants to save many can't even save himself right and that's true he couldn't there's no way he could come off that cross and save yourself cuz he was there to save me and you he wasn't there he didn't need saving what do you need salvation for he need salvation we needed salvation what a mighty God we serve he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no V I'm sorry he's cut off cut off among the land of people for the transgression of my people was he stricken and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth what was he was Guiltless he was blameless they could find no guilt in him at all exactly yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief when when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin sacrifice on the altar he shall see his seed right he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand right he shall see the travail of his soul amen what I just read there in John right my soul's troubled what you know why birth pains right birth pains he was getting trying he was getting us we were wanting out Eve was wanting out of Adam so what they could fellowship and you no it wasn't Eve running around the there no it's that's the purpose of almighty God yeah all right is to get us out so that we can fellowship with him he shall see the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied for by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquity therefore will I divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong he shall divide he's given something to us because he have poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors what he had two thieves on the cross they just they just crucified three people that day that's all they knew they didn't crucify the righteous one and two thieves they looked up and and saw three people that were what surely they done something wrong or they would have been crucified exactly surely they that this man is is hanging on a cross because of something he did no it's something we did right so he was count numbered with the transgressors he wasn't a transgressor he was numbered with them amen and the three all right and he bear the sin of many and made intercession for their transgression now let's go to Matthew 28 and in the end of the Sabbath as it began to Dawn toward the first day of the week Came Mary Magdalene the other Mary to see the supper and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel the original says for an angel but for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the Stone from the door and sat upon it now Jesus was already gone Jesus was already gone right his countenance was like lightning and his rment white as snow and for fear of him the keepers did shake and became his dead and the angel answered and said unto the women fear not for I know that you seek Jesus which was crucified he is not here for He Is Risen right as he said come see the place where the Lord lay he's not here right he's risen a secret Resurrection right cuz they didn't believe it right the two men outside said well they must have stole his body well they concocted that story because those two men could look and see that thing sealed up and then all of a sudden they see this something coming in white and rolling the stone away and the man sitting on the stone and they look inside and don't see anything yeah they fell down as dead people so would you and me okay and then it ConEd the story but Jesus didn't need the uh the dead Saints listen this is a secret Gathering a secret coming of Christ right this is a secret a secret Resurrection right this is not where he'll split the Eastern skies and all the eyes will see him no no no you better not be in that part everybody understand that right that's where every eye will see him this is not this is a secret catching away you're not going to we're not going to go out to brother Tatum and brother Mo and all those Graves and going to see the graves that like something dug them up right I don't think so right they'll come right out of that grave and never touch a piece of dirt they'll never touch a piece of dirt people will still walk out there and go brother Tatum laying there dead cuz I see his headstone and he died so many years ago and his Grave's not even touched I mean it wouldn't be a secret if everybody all these Graves start popping open that wouldn't be a secret right so Jesus in his resurrection was showing you like brother Daniel said that's what spared me when he said that he said the resurrection ction started from within the Earth Jesus come up out of hell picked that body up amen walked right through the wall yeah never never touched a thing never Disturbed any element of the world right he just walked right on through that wall and went out and they told him to go to Jerusalem or wherever he was to meet him and and of course they didn't believe him at all but he started a work from within the Earth right it's a secret he said the world will see me no more right but you'll see me amen for I'll be with you right even in you glory so the secret resurrection of the Bride is right here Glory starting right here thank you Lord right here you know what it's not going to disturb a bit of this Earth it's just going to change it it ain't going to make me a big old tall 6'8 guy no not going to disturb any of this earth right here just going to change it amen that's good he came back at Pentecost for the rest of his new creation sure Adam's race is still here but there's a spiritual race working in the natural race yeah the rest of this creation is by the New Birth the word the Bible said remember they hid the word in what Earth and vessels so that's exactly what it is the seed now has come planted in Your Heart by the new birth you are now the family of God Amen let's go to quote number 11 we got about six quotes in a row and we'll let brother Brown finish the whole thing off the Bible said that an illegitimate called bastard child could not enter the congregation of the Lord for 10 Generations which would be 400 years that an illegitimate child could not come into the congregation of the Lord that's how bad that hybriding was that was a woman that let another man live with her in order to bring forth a child that child was hybrid not by its father but by some other man see and that was so evil before God it taken 10 generations to ever breed that out again before God but that doesn't apply to this age you have a new birth now they don't they had just one birth back there that was the actual sexual breeding what back in the Old Testament right right that's what he's talking about talking about the Old Testament right they had just one birth back there and that was a sexual birth they didn't have no new birth in the Old Testament and people in this message would read yeah they had just one birth back there that was the actual sexual breeding we have this new birth now which is the spiritual that breathes out all the C glory and we are new creatures in Christ Jesus born again of the spirit of God new creatures on the word creature if some of you good Scholars here that understand if you don't you might look it up the creature comes from the Greek word of a new creation oh the same as you you are a creature here born sexually you are then a new creation born Heavenly right of in God's new creation of a new man New Creation at the birth but it has to be a birth just the same as the natural birth is necessary the spiritual birth is just as necessary as the natural birth let's go to the next one why had to be Shepherds now notice God is fixing to make another creation he created mortal Earth Earth mortal life Angels sing in heaven right but here he's creating a new life eternal life for man and he's singing to his subjects through Angels on the earth not in heaven heaven had eternal life amen look Heaven had eternal life he's bringing eternal life down to us now amen and he sang they sang to the heavens and when the Mortal creation come in and here the immortal creation is coming in and now they're singing to Earthly people the first time to Shepherds striking isn't it he had started a new creation what was it a creation of himself right God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us that the Bible said in the beginning of the creation of God God was created in human form in Jesus Christ his son God dwelt he built his Tabernacle of Flesh and Bone and lived in that Tabernacle God Emanuel God With Us he built himself a house to live in it so he could reflect his word to to his subjects through that you know what God is when you see Christ amen all right Next One Church H book now comes our triumphal Capstone on the baptism of the Holy Ghost Galatians 4: 4-7 but when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of of sons because you are Sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying AB the father wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but a son and if a son and an heir of God through Christ there it is Jesus Christ came forth died upon the cross and accomplished Redemption amen restoring to original owner by means of purchase are paying the price and thereby placed us as Sons amen he did not make us Sons we were already his sons for the foundation of the world but he placed us his sons for as long as we were in the world in the flesh we could not be recognized as his sons we were held captive by the devil but we were Sons nonetheless and hear this and because you are son God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts whereby cry father father upon whom did the Spirit fall at Pentecost Sons at Corinth upon sons while they heard the seed right book Words original the swer went out to S what seed son of man Jesus Christ was sewing the seed what he was sowing the word that you and I responded to remember the quote that I made you know you respond to the word that God knew God knew that you to respond to a certain part of the word and that's he put the word there for you so therefore that's what you respond back to Glory while they heard the word go next one Third Exodus first Exodus what did he do he brought them out of a natural land what he brought Israel out of a natural land to a natural land right it was a promise land but it was a natural land the second Exodus he brought them out from a spiritual condition scribes Pharisees herodians and all that from a spiritual condition into a spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost now he's bringing them from the spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost listen to this right back into the Eternal land of the Millennium in the great Hereafter that's the Third Exodus that's getting out of here same Pillar of Fire by the same anointed system same God doing the same thing the same word declared the first one declared the second one the same word declared the second one has declared the third one right and here we see it among us and here we see it Among Us come out oh come out of this chaos come to the Living God come to the word and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and now he's in our flesh dwelling Among Us come out and serve the living Living God while we bow our heads and the brother speaks in another tongue all right let's go to the next one or is that the last one there's one more I think Christ is the mystery of God reveal 14 we got a couple more and when the word moves on down into the body from the head what is it this same word nothing can be added or taken from it so that same word moves from the head as the day comes close down into the body down into the body vindicating that are one they are husband and wife right flesh of his flesh word of his word life of his life Spirit of his Spirit see amen how do you know it Bears the same record same fruit same word see manifest Christ same life same God Same Spirit same word same book amen same signs things that I do you do also oh Hallelujah my notice the Vindicated word in his body is his very Victory and the reason of his death right right see the death not in spirit when he died he only died in the flesh his Spirit went to hell and preached to the souls in prison that right his flesh only died then he raised it up again and quickened it Quicken means make alive his flesh which was his body and that's the word it's been laying dead for years talk about his body here but it gradually began to come into the re reformation and now she is standing a point her feet Hallelujah Resurrection is standing up you don't resurrect somebody laying down when he get resurrect buddy when Lazarus came out of that tomb he was standing up they didn't have to carry him out right they didn't have to carry Jesus out of the Grave anyway he was standing up all right look 15 just like this with my shadow here of my hand if I never seen my hand seen I've seen the shadow it's kind of it gets pale as it gets away but as it gets closer and closer the negative and positive are coming together until they both become the same thing what the negative down here positive of God right that's exactly when the church and the word has to be one like Jesus and God was one exactly let's go ahead and read the next one all right Christ was revealed in his own word all right the entire Bible is the entire revelation of Jesus Christ making itself known to every age he made himself known in the days of Luther as a foundation the church the foot the leg like he did King Nebuchadnezzar you remember how he dreamed those dreams and come up from the head down see now he comes from the feet up amen see in the Babylonian Kingdom he showed all those Old Testaments he came from the head down until he come down until God himself became flesh at the foot of the ladder now here in the New Testament he brings himself right back up again to the head again the head of gold to be crowned look you get it see God was in the beginning and he kept coming down through the prophets and on down until God himself became human like us plumbed down at the foot of the ladder a baby born in a manger hated rejected despised a bad name and everything he was then he started Rising see and from the feet he began to build the church to bride coming back what building his family amen now coming out into the headstone where it all joins together and makes the one great transfigured body of Jesus Christ amen rising of the sun because I live you live also speaking to his wife because I live you live also what a resurrection that that was amen and what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in Christ by God's quickening PowerAll amen amen his children are here right God's children are on the earth the last part of this family album I believe on the Earth right because we're getting close to the end time and I believe that the 144,000 are over there somewhere in Israel doing their thing is kind of like I said last night and I wasn't trying to be derogatory but look if we if we got the promise of the new birth if we have the new birth all these other things will take care of theel right whether you go by the grave or where you're alive and remain and really that is your choice still that's your choice but remember one thing God's plan is if you get born again and you get the promise the promise is what going to take you somewhere promise is going to take you like I telling them last night we were talking about certain things and it's good to talk about certain details about things but you know what when I get ready to go to Kansas or get ready to fly to
