========================================

morning how's everybody doing wonderful good to be alive and back in that home yesterday yeah we did yeah amen I'm proud to give brother away to break after that good job they work hard yes they did and drove back and forth we didn't have a show first you had off that's your shelter then he had he volunteers I can't hear that I can't hear it what's it saying all right we're all Matthew 5 chapter five we're looking at the beginning Matthew chapter five let it come from around here Matthew 5. fine so last time we stopped at the first beatitude blessed are the poor in the spirit and we were talking about how Jesus this parallels um how Moses went up the mountain to get the Commandments in the Old Testament now that here in the New Testament Jesus goes up the mountain to deliver to make to magnify the law to deliver the Commandments to enter into a new kingdom and to and to set forth the character of the people that are going to be in the New Kingdom amen and I will act and uh this is just um as we go through the Beatitudes it's just kind of a mirror for her to look into and reflect back how our lives should be and examine our own selves and see if we measure up that gives us a it gives us kind of a measuring to how to enter into the kingdom so we um let's see let's go ahead and read from starting in verse one and seeing the multitudes he went up into a mountain and when he was sick his disciples came unto him and he opened his mouth and taught them saying and we last time we mentioned out people came from the East and West up to this mountain where the Commandments were delivered and he opened his mouth because the spoken word is the Original Seed and he was delivering his word for them to make to teach them how to enter into the Kingdom so that his word could be made manifest in their lives I mean he's saying further on the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand that was back in chapter four The Kingdom of Heaven is repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand the Kingdom of Heaven is the king of first the kingdom that will be in you because if you are part of the Kingdom by receiving the new birth the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand because he was about to uh give his life for us so that we could be partakers in chapter act in the second chapter of acts so that we should enter into that Kingdom and all of these blessings are are paradoxes because to the world to the Natural Eye how can you be blessed if you're poor in spirit how can you be blessed if you're Mourning but to the spiritual when you become part of this Kingdom these things become a blessing to me so let's let's see we kind of finished on a foreign spirit that's interesting that just like in Revelation when Jesus speaking to the churches he doesn't start with any kind of condemnation but he starts with a blessing right blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven and the poor and spirit are those that come to a revelation that they are nothing that they uh there's no way in themselves that they can reach the righteousness that God requires right that they're hungry they begin by a revelation that God gives them calling it the other night bible study we were each of us kind of got to give a chance to give a little testimony of how God first started calling us and when God calls you you know you go through uh maybe go to church for a while and um hear the word but then there comes a point in your time in your life when God kisses a hold of you and starts pulling at your heartstrings and your your life you maybe you'll be going down the wrong path but all of a sudden when that happens right when God gives you a revelation of that you are poor in spirit then the direction of your life changes that's right when it's really something that only only God can do that um to give you that realization that there's nothing in yourself that will ever be able to um to meet the righteousness that God requires in Psalm 51 I'll just read this Psalm 51 16 17. um it says for thou desire it's not sacrifice else would I give it thou Delight is not and burn offering we talk about this a lot on the last time the sacrifices of God are our broken Spirit are broken and a contrite heart of God that ought not spies we know David was a man after God's Own Heart and David knew that the approach to God was um was through a right right attitude the right motives and objectives to do what God requires not just because the list of Commandments required in the list of things to do to come to church but because we have a motive to get into fellowship with God and look Beyond and sacrifice into the holy of holies and say God help me to get in there where I could fill the ship of God in partake of the um the manner that Ten Commandments of the um Rod that budded a new life and in uh Isaiah 66 1 through 2 he said thus saith the Lord that heaven is my throne and the Earth is my foot still where is the house that you build into me and where's the place of my wrist for all those things after mine the handmade and all those things have been said the Lord but to this man while I look even to him that is poured of a contrite spirit and trimless at my word so the poor and spirit rely on God not on himself not on anything that we can do not only anything that man can do and and uh James chapter 2 if y'all want to just fall off now this was written Jane this is written to um to admonish the brothers that that the word is poor Spirit are you but the context is the same because instead of relying on God they began to rely look on people in the church there uh had a lot of money and influence so he said my brother have not the Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ the Lord Of Glory with respect of persons for if they'll come under your assembly of man with a gold ring and goodly apparel and they're coming also a poor man of ballerina and he have respect to him that we're at the gay clothing and say unto him sit down here in a good place and say to the poor stand now there or sit under my footstool so he's talking about relying having our faith in God not anything that we can do that's uh the poor in spirit um when Jesus in Luke chapter two I'll just kind of talk through this God comes to the poor in the spirit that will believe in Luke Chapter 2 it came to the shepherds in the field that the um that that God knew you would believe him and I um I was just reading through uh John Wesley's testimony of Salvation he might not have ever heard it before but you know uh he thought that he had a relationship with God until he got on that ship and they started rocking to and fro and he was coming to America and he he saw the lives at the moravians lived and he knew something was lacking this is what he said in this refined way of trusting to my own works and my own righteousness I dragged on heavily finding no Comfort or heal there until the time of my leaving leaving England on shipboard however I was again active in outward Works where pleased God of his free Mercy to give me 26 of the Moravian brethren for companions who endeavored to show me a more excellent way but I understood it not at first I was to learn and too wise so that is seeing the foolishness under me and I continued preaching and following after and trusting in that righteousness whereby no flesh can be justified and then he goes on to talk about um he continued to seek the Lord and uh just as I went out open it again on those words Thou Art not far from the kingdom of God in the afternoon I was asked to go to Saint Paul's The Anthem was out of the deep have I called unto thee Oh Lord hear my voice so let that ears consider well the voice of my complaint if not Lord will be extreme to mark but there's none of this oh Lord who may abide it but there is Mercy with thee therefore Thou shalt be feared for Israel trust in the Lord for with the Lord there is Mercy and with him is plenteous redemption and he shall redeem Israel from all his sins so John Wesley came to a place where he knew that his own righteousness his own Works amen would not meet the requirement when brother Brown said in the Seal of God we can get down to a real contract broken Spirit where sin is mix that together and started old-fashioned crying out of a newborn child that's the kind that gets the Holy Ghost that's right no matter whether they're bad Methodist Baptist or Catholic or whatever they are when they get before that offer and cry day and night oh Lord God look at the sins of this city my heart can't rest I can't rest Lord to see these things going on oh God do something and then let's go to Matthew 5. 4 blessed are they that more and they shall be comforted and um as we kind of go along you can see a little progression of the Believers walk through these Beatitudes first God reveals to you that you need to be saved that you're poor and spirit and you can't do anything and you begin to mourn no these things think about that message that brother Brown pretty steep calls to the Deep the Deep draws Us by calling us at first growing us up to Faith the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then continue to draw us amen through the Christian experience in uh let's go to Second Corinthians chapter 7. we're talking about morning now remember in First Corinthians Paul uh Paul wrote First Corinth is because he got a letter from Apollos and uh Chloe and the saints that correct for us saying there's some things going on here that need to be corrected and uh so he corrected him and now in the second Corinthians let's read what he said let's see verse one where the main point is we're going to get down to verse 10 and 11. but just let's just kind of set the stage by reading the whole story having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us lend ourselves from all filthiness of the Flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of God receive us we have wronged no man we have corrupted no man we have the fraud in new man I speak not this to condemn you for I have said before that you are in our hearts to die and live with you see he's trying to say I'm not I didn't write those things or I'm not writing these things now because that I'm uh I don't like you or anything I want the best for you right the great is my boldness of speech towards you great is my glory of you I'm filled with Comfort I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation for when we were coming to Macedonia our flesh had no rest but we were troubled on every side without we're fighting within our fears nevertheless God that comforteth those that are cast down comforted Us by the coming of Titus and not by his coming only but by the consolation we're with he was comforted in you when he told us your earnest desire your mourning your fervent mind toward me so that I Rejoice the Lord so he gave him a little uh a little rebuke but it Eternal and we'll see why in a second for though I made you sorry with a letter I do not repent though I did repent for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry though it were but for a season so he may be at first he felt a little bad for his harsh words but then after he saw the effect right he didn't repent now I Rejoice not that you were made sorry but that ye sorrow to repentance you were made sorry after a Godly manner that you might receive damage by us and nothing Godly Soul or worketh repentance to Salvation not to be repented of but the sorrow of the world the work of the Dead Brother so there's two different kinds of sour there's sorrow there's Godly sorrow and their sorrow of the world the sorrow of the world is the sorrow that comes from not having from uh we're only put it this way from drinking from broken sisters right if you're drinking from a bubbling spring you've got Everlasting righteousness that's right that produces a Godly sorrow of repentance to Salvation not to be repented of like he said but Godly sorrow that where you you're trying to uh get away from let do you want to let the old man die as opposed to sorrow of the world right of those that know don't know God but he trust is in themselves right or in some arm of Flesh who rely on the happiness of the world in all things brother Graham said in the seven Church ages he said in 1954 I tell you we're getting an old-fashioned Revival like we used to have down in the country when they laid on their face all night long not to carry on but when real goddess are and not go back to the Altar and stay but go out and make it right with the neighbors they had made it wrong with it and get straightened up I think that's such a powerful quote because we think well if we kind of uh you think well I've got this Godly sorrow I'll just stay at the altar and and that will be instead of getting up and doing what God requires they'll make it right with your neighbor um I'm struggling with how to say this um obedience is rather than sacrifice you do good do what God requires you know a lot of people say well if I have a sincere heart God will accept me uh even though I you know you can read in the words it says repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ whoever if I go and be baptized in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost that's good enough but God has required in his word for you to obey him right just like uh remember Abel abaded his Revelation that he had right and took the lamb instead of doing what seemed more beautiful and more uh righteous and holy like Cain did put all of his uh his uh the crops of the field on the offer instead of taking a bloody lamb and sacrificing that which is what God required God required Blood on the offer amen sometimes the writer what what is right what needs to be done right is more messy it's it's not comfortable it's not comfortable to get up to approach your brother and say I was wrong forgiving it's not comfortable to um God being misunderstood in 1961 and said what comes first repentance Godly solder for your sins then turn away and then be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ it's all right you've done all this for a mission of sins in 1963 just what just once more Lord he said but when it comes right down to putting what you say you believe into practice and willing to confess the role they don't do it it just isn't there and you can say what you believe all day long but we didn't really need to put what you believe into practice right that's that shows the difference they don't have it well that's real confection that's what we need we've long-lived that a long time ago and swapped it prayer and confession and conviction we swapped it for a motion shaking or jerking or jumping up and down that's the reason there's no holding tight because there's nothing there to hold them until you come upon the basis of God's word of Godly sorrow ready to repent and make anything right and do what's right ready to live right I don't care what the people say or anything else you live for your Jesus Christ and what he said then you take a church like that coming back there's a possibility of it coming but they're not willing to do it right and the scripture says blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted how will they be comforted let's go to John chapter 14. John chapter 14. let's look at verse 12. actually let's start it yeah verse 12. so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was sat down again he said unto them no ye what I have done to you you call to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet ye also ought to watch one another's feet for I have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are you if you do them well I'm reading verse 13. sorry chapter 13. Chapter 14 verse 12. verily verily I say unto you that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go into my father and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if he shall ask anything in my name I will do it if you love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world of this is this is going to tie up the spirit of Truth is going to tie into it when we get to hungry and thirsting for righteousness whom the world cannot receive because it sees him not that's right neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortable us I will come to amen so there's a scripture that if you say it's somebody else there's another person there's three different persons he said we will send you a comforter ride I'm coming to you yet a little while in the world see if me no more but you see me because I live you should live also and that day ye shall know that I am in my father and he and me and I and you the morning of the Holy Ghost for the morning like first she comes to realize the Revelation that you're poor in spirit you begin to mourn and you're being led to remember that someone on the mount is God Jesus is establishing his new kingdom a new kingdom is Christ in you so that the day that morning will be comforted because he will send a comforter to comfort us uh the morning is um and evidence of the Holy Ghost when we talked about um I'm just reading this real quick leadership chapters 1965. really are you a genuine Bible Christian full of love oh God remember the Bible said in the last days when this time takes place he said I'm marking Angel went through the churches went through the cities and sealed only those who sought and cried for the Abomination that was done in the city now pick out is your heart still concerned about the sinners and the way that the church and the people are doing to you can sign cry about it day and night if not so I'm wondering that's the scripture so uh in the last five minutes or so let's go back to Matthew five five listed on the Meech and are they showing here and here and okay now um meekness is um something that uh a lot of people maybe misinterpret for um being a pushover but now a real Christian that takes hold to the word of God is not a pushover that's right when it comes to believing God's word amen you can't push around a Christian and say that ain't right right if I was a Christian I'll take God's word and and the meat will inherit the earth so what is the earth in the Old Testament they uh went into tan and Titan was like obtaining the promised land was uh to us as a type of all the promises of this new kingdom the meat will inherit every promise of this new economy that God has set up foreign looking down through the the attitudes that we've looked at so far poverty of spirit I need God in your mourning over your lost condition you're starting to judge yourself your Sorrowing you're realizing that more and more that you need God you're drawing closer to God and then we get to humility and I'm just abandoning all pretenses at my own personal Merit and I'm Meek and lonely like Jesus I'm quiet gentle easily imposed on um mild submissive somebody can tell me where I'm wrong and I will take that to heart and try to do better and in the Old Testament uh the best example for me is no I'll just read this real quick numbers 12 1-3 and millions of minimum Marion and Aaron uh were speaking against Moses and speaking against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman who he had married for he had married an Ethiopian woman and isn't that just that opposite of meekness that after all the signs and wonders that had been wrought through Moses they had seen the serpent uh turned into the staff and the seed part of it and then now they're going to come and say well he married an Ethiopian woman that's just like a lot of us today you may uh yeah bring up a little uh try to find little faults after all the many miracles that we've seen for he had married an Ethiopian woman and they said half the Lord indeed spoken only by Moses has he not spoken also by us and the Lord heard it now the man Moses was very meat above all the men which are upon the face of the Earth and that's uh something to be said above all the people that are on the face of the Earth and what real true meekness is I believe is that you don't have anything to prove let God fight your bowels and that's that's exactly what happened with Moses this God God heard it it's not the Lord heard it and he came down and he fought Moses battles for you he'll he'll back you up around and said if I preach his word he'll back it up laughs and he turned Moses turned his back on worldly honors and Earthly reaches and he turns just like Jesus did he chose the life of a pilgrim over a Pharaoh's Palace because when Jesus came to Earth he could have he could have come with a big entourage and a big celebration that he came locally in a manger and Moses could have rolled up in a Pharaoh's Palace but he turned to the side aside from that and went into the Wilderness and found God and when in Exodus 3 11 after God had found Moses Moses said unto God who am I that I should go into pharaoh and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt now maybe Miriam Manera would respond a little bit different yeah I'll be glad to go because I've got maybe all this education all of my My Flesh to back me up but Moses uh was relying he found that all he had to rely on was on God and God would back him up in Psalm 25 9 it says the meek will he God in judgment enemy will he teaches away because the meat can be taught in Matthew 11 29 Jesus said take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lonely in heart and ye shall find a rest into your souls now let's look at Galatians 6. Galatians chapter 6. just real quick a real true meekness is how we should approach our brothers and sisters if we find a fault Galatians 6 1-3 Brethren is from man be overtaken in a fall you which are spiritual restore section one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted because meekness realizes that all of his strength comes from God and if it wasn't for God but where would we all be what none of us are better than the other right we have the Holy Ghost God sees us all the same we can all approach God to take advantage of his promises that he promised to us and the program said meekness was to let the other man have what he wants and the sudden secret going away to the church in 1958 he said what do we care what the world says a real Christian this is one of my favorite quotes what do we care oh sorry the next part is this this one is two but the next quote is one that I just have cherished all my Christian Life what do we care if we have to be despised and rejected blessed are the meat for they shall inherit the earth the Boston Center coming one day and we're going to do away except for what difference does it make to us to us if you love his appearance and in Hebrews chapter 7 1957 he said now you've noticed Abraham he doesn't fuss with a lot he said we are brethren we must not argue but you lift up your head and you go any way you want to go so he let God lock shoes first and if you go east I'll go west you go north I'll go south that's the Christian attitude we're willing to give the other man the best of the deal always present it to him let him take his choice for why what made Abraham do it he knew that he was promised by God that he would inherit the whole thing in it now so then a tent or a college why should we care the whole thing belongs to us and this attitude affects our how we treat other people listen this blessed are the meat before they should want to hear of the earth It All Belongs to us God said so so give the man the best of the choice if he wants to because maybe that's all he'll ever get right maybe that's all he ever did that's something to think about when you come across people through life is that maybe they've got a big fine mansion in this life because they won't have a mansion in the world to come that's right because they'll turn down the gospel let people uh treat people nice because this might be all they'll ever get right but it all belongs to you The Heirs of Salvation by promise and if it all belongs to you if you've got that Revelation that it all belongs to you that it shouldn't be that hard to treat other people that way let's uh let's stop right there amen that's it amen
