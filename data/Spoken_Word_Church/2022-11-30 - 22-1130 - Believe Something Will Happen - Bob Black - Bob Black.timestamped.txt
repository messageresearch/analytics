[6:10] chapter 10 verses 12 to 15.
[6:13] and if you have your Bibles you can turn
[6:15] there or you can look up on the screen
[6:16] here

[6:19] something something tonight this uh just
[6:22] the Lord late on my heart believe
[6:23] something will happen
[6:26] let's just go to the Lord in prayer Lord
[6:28] God we're so grateful to be able to
[6:30] gather together around your word and I
[6:31] pray God as WE peer into your promises
[6:33] Lord Jesus that you'll Quicken them to
[6:35] us Lord Lord that you'll build our faith
[6:37] Lord God and edify us tonight Lord and
[6:40] Lord we know Lord that we're meeting
[6:42] we're such a needy people or God and we
[6:44] have many different needs Lord and
[6:45] sicknesses and ailments and problems in
[6:48] our mind and problems in our bodies Lord
[6:50] Jesus and I pray God that you'll just
[6:51] speak exactly what we have to need what
[6:54] we have need of tonight Lord God Lord to
[6:56] just build our faith up to where we can
[6:58] believe that something will happen
[7:00] we ask that you'll granted your name
[7:02] amen
[7:04] so Joshua chapter 10 uh verse verse 12
[7:08] says then speak Joshua to the Lord and
[7:10] the day when the Lord delivered up the
[7:12] amorites before the children of Israel
[7:13] and he said in the sight of Israel son
[7:16] stands still thou upon gabean and thou
[7:19] moon in the valley of agilon and the sun
[7:21] Stood Still and the Moon is stayed until
[7:23] the people had Avenged themselves upon
[7:25] their enemies it's not this written in
[7:27] the book of jasher so the son stood
[7:30] still in the midst of heaven and hasted
[7:32] not to go down about a whole day and
[7:34] there was no day like that before it or
[7:36] after it that the Lord hearkened unto
[7:38] the voice of a man for the Lord of
[7:39] fought for Israel and Joshua returned
[7:42] and all Israel with him unto the camp to
[7:44] gilgal
[7:45] you may be seated The Lord At His
[7:47] blessings to the reading of the word
[7:49] now just to kind of set the stage I I'm
[7:52] going to talk about somebody and the one
[7:54] I'm going to talk about is is this man I
[7:56] I got to looking at what he believes and
[7:59] um some of y'all have listened to him
[8:00] online and read what he uh and kind of
[8:03] talked about uh just listen to what he
[8:05] has to say and he's this preacher out on
[8:07] the west coast called John McArthur and
[8:11] um he believes that uh well I I wanted
[8:14] to really he said some things about
[8:16] about miracles and how God just don't
[8:18] really work the way that he used to and
[8:20] so I really wanted to dive in and see a
[8:22] little bit more about what he what he
[8:24] really believed and come to find out
[8:25] what he's gotten to do is he he's looked
[8:28] at all the Hypocrites and all the fakers
[8:31] and all of the things he's looked at the
[8:33] ones that said look at my little piece
[8:34] of toast that there's uh it's look it's
[8:36] the face of Jesus and this signifies
[8:38] that I'm something special and look at
[8:40] look at the one he's looked at the ones
[8:42] that all these different ones that say
[8:43] uh just just uh dramatic things and he's
[8:47] he's began to like so many so many today
[8:50] even maybe even today in the message
[8:52] began to associate something happening
[8:54] with a hypocrite now brother John John
[8:57] McArthur he made a statement he said
[8:59] that God had a special purpose for the
[9:01] errors of Revelation back there you know
[9:03] the days of Paul and the days of the
[9:05] Apostles but now he's got a different
[9:07] purpose now just as powerful just as is
[9:10] wonderful so he's saying in other words
[9:11] now now we we we're just we're just
[9:14] about understanding as long as we
[9:15] understand and God's not going to
[9:17] manifest himself so much in Miracles and
[9:19] things the way he did with the early
[9:21] Church in other words he's packaging it
[9:23] up with if we could say it another way
[9:25] that the days of Miracles has passed
[9:27] that you're not going to see God move in
[9:29] the way that you did with the early
[9:30] church
[9:31] because what's he doing he's associating
[9:34] he's associating Miracles with
[9:36] Hypocrites now now we maybe let's bring
[9:39] it bring it on down I ask the question
[9:42] do we are we doing the very same thing
[9:44] because you know sometimes you I I think
[9:47] we've we've all uh
[9:50] we've uh sometimes we can look at we
[9:53] we've all heard we've all read the
[9:54] message anointing the ones at the end
[9:56] time and and we know the things that
[9:58] brother Brown said about that but then
[10:00] we can we can maybe almost in our mind
[10:01] begin to associate God actually doing
[10:03] anything because we've seen so many
[10:05] Hypocrites and we've seen so many fakers
[10:07] and we've seen so many say I mean come
[10:09] on now let's look at look back in your
[10:11] own life all the ones that you've heard
[10:12] say well I had a dream and that shows me
[10:15] that I should I should do such and such
[10:16] a thing but yeah they won't even come to
[10:18] church and I I've I've saw a vision or
[10:21] I've saw something but yet they're not
[10:23] matching up with the word and you know
[10:25] they're not living right and we've seen
[10:26] so much fate but you know there really
[10:28] is a genuine and this message came to
[10:32] actually loose to us the supernatural
[10:34] something if you believe something's
[10:36] going to happen and when that something
[10:37] happens you don't look at it and say
[10:39] don't look at something happening when
[10:41] somebody comes up to you and tells you a
[10:42] testimony of God actually doing
[10:44] something in their life and changing the
[10:46] situation in their family don't look at
[10:48] it with critical eyes but I I I believe
[10:50] that God wants us now and in this hour
[10:52] to begin to realize that miracles do
[10:54] happen that God is a god of Miracles God
[10:58] is a god a miracle a miracle that God
[11:00] can change your life do you realize
[11:01] that's a miracle that God can change
[11:03] your life it's a miracle that God can
[11:05] come down and move into people and
[11:07] worship and change their worship to
[11:10] whether or not all starts and stiff
[11:11] anymore but to where God is actually
[11:13] moving in there they're moving in their
[11:15] lives it's a miracle that God can take a
[11:18] young person that's got a nicotine
[11:20] addiction and take away that habit from
[11:22] him in a day he said whether they don't
[11:24] want nicotine anymore it's a miracle
[11:26] that God can come down in a service and
[11:28] speak a word is it to somebody that that
[11:30] begins to where they catch something and
[11:33] a tumor will fall off it's a miracle
[11:36] that God can deliver somebody from
[11:37] kidney disease it's a miracle that God
[11:40] can deliver somebody of a migraine and
[11:42] take that away from him you see God is a
[11:45] god of Miracles and if you believe
[11:46] something's going to happen you look
[11:49] down through all the Old Testament all
[11:51] the New Testament and of all the people
[11:53] that believe if you're going to read
[11:55] Hebrews 11 which is what we're about to
[11:56] get to into Sunday school if you're
[11:58] going to read every one of those
[11:59] testimonies of faith when they believe
[12:02] something happened they were given a
[12:04] baby or their their health was restored
[12:06] or their life was destroyed or God came
[12:08] on the scene and fought their battles
[12:10] and that same God that fought their
[12:12] battles is here on the scene to find
[12:13] your battles that weren't when your boss
[12:15] don't love you your wife don't love your
[12:18] husband don't love you or your kids have
[12:20] turned away from you that God is still a
[12:23] miracle what can God God is still on the
[12:25] scene to work a miracle now you see what
[12:28] John MacArthur didn't understand doesn't
[12:30] understand today that the days of
[12:32] Miracles has not passed and he's what
[12:34] he's got he's got all caught up looking
[12:36] at the false but you see this afternoon
[12:38] if we'll just get away from looking at
[12:40] the faults and looking at one another
[12:42] and wondering why God don't heal that
[12:44] one over there that we're looking at if
[12:46] we'll just keep our eyes on Jesus and
[12:48] believe something is going to happen how
[12:51] many this afternoon won't something that
[12:53] happened in your life how many wants to
[12:55] see God move in your life something will
[12:58] happen
[12:59] sometimes we just think that miracles of
[13:01] Out Of Reach sometimes we think God has
[13:03] left us that God has moved away from us
[13:05] that God ain't here sometimes we've got
[13:07] we get cabbage down and we think well
[13:09] it's just good enough as long as I know
[13:11] the message but I don't want to just
[13:13] know the message I want to live the
[13:15] message I want to live with so much that
[13:17] others see Christ Living in me to see
[13:19] that God has done something in my life
[13:22] and brothers said that's the way when we
[13:24] come into Christ if something just seems
[13:26] a little bit high like Miracles like God
[13:28] actually doing something Step Up In The
[13:31] Gospel ranks and find out what belongs
[13:33] to you I believe tonight maybe if we can
[13:35] just grasp what belongs to us that God
[13:38] is still a god of Miracles that he steal
[13:40] Jehovah Jireh that that same God that
[13:42] has spoke a ram into existence next to
[13:44] Abraham is still able to speak a miracle
[13:47] in your life tonight God's got a step
[13:49] ladder that reaches Plumbing to Glory
[13:51] Jacob saw it one night with angels
[13:54] coming up and down from Earth to Glory
[13:55] it's all yours God's provided it for you
[13:59] just get on it tonight and climb right
[14:01] on out of this Earth people here that
[14:03] says the days the Miracles are passed we
[14:06] are not Earthbound people we are
[14:08] heaven-bound people filled with the Holy
[14:10] Ghost climbing the ladder to Glory going
[14:13] to Glory everything along the road
[14:15] belongs to us to us Everything Jesus
[14:18] died for belongs for us
[14:21] I'm still looking for paradoxes tonight
[14:23] I'm still expecting something to happen
[14:26] how could you not expect something to
[14:28] happen if you could look into God's word
[14:30] and see that everything that Jesus died
[14:32] for you belongs to you I think that's
[14:34] what Joshua was doing when he spoke when
[14:36] he spoke and the moon stood still over
[14:38] there and the sun's stood still over
[14:40] there he got a glimpse at everything
[14:42] everything God had promised belongs to
[14:44] him he was sitting there in the promised
[14:46] land going on the way to the promised
[14:48] land and he knew that all those promises
[14:50] were his and if we could grasp that
[14:52] tonight that all these promises lay it
[14:54] here in the word are ours something is
[14:56] going to happen
[14:57] but around if you go look and find how
[15:00] many times that brother Brown said
[15:02] something happened he said if
[15:04] 556 times all of a sudden something
[15:07] happened in a real cool feeling went
[15:09] through her and she began to cry and the
[15:11] sister in the prayer line something
[15:13] happened there in the church one night
[15:15] he said God bless you something happened
[15:18] then didn't it something happened your
[15:21] healed sister he told his sister
[15:23] something happened then when I said that
[15:25] didn't it there's something happen here
[15:28] a new creature was born he said in
[15:30] another place and 556 times he said
[15:33] something happened why because somebody
[15:35] got to believe in somebody walked
[15:38] through a prayer line and got to believe
[15:39] and somebody said in the congregation
[15:41] and got to believe in somebody began to
[15:43] accept God's word and got to believe it
[15:45] and something happened and when you
[15:47] believe something will happen to don't
[15:49] be afraid for something to happen people
[15:52] around the message have got to they got
[15:54] to think of that it's good we're just
[15:55] cabbage down and we think we think we've
[15:57] got it because we understand things but
[16:00] I've got to see it lived in me
[16:03] listen it's not that knowing it's not
[16:05] that knowing that makes you a hypocrite
[16:06] we get so scared we got so spooky of the
[16:09] anointing sometimes it's like this the
[16:11] the disciples there on the water when
[16:13] they saw Jesus walking toward them it's
[16:15] not the anointing that makes you a
[16:16] hypocrite are we afraid of being a
[16:18] hypocrite sometimes because the
[16:20] anointing comes because God gets to move
[16:22] it in the people it's to see that you
[16:24] have received that makes you a hypocrite
[16:26] you receive even the word of God or the
[16:28] serpent seed you receive either of those
[16:31] two seeds and hold it in your heart and
[16:32] that's what makes you a hypocrite
[16:34] but we need God God to move this gospel
[16:38] was given so that something will happen
[16:42] it was given so that something would
[16:44] happen don't be afraid of something
[16:45] happening when something happens in the
[16:47] church don't look at it it stands and
[16:49] say well I wonder if that's really true
[16:51] I want something to happen in my life
[16:53] you know from the very first gospel
[16:56] sermon that was ever preached there on
[16:58] the day of Pentecost when Peter come
[16:59] down them Steps From The Upper Room and
[17:01] begin to Proclaim what had happened
[17:03] something happened the very first sermon
[17:06] produced something happened the Holy
[17:08] Ghost fell on all them that were filled
[17:10] outside the Holy Ghost fell on them in
[17:12] the house of Cornelius when the word was
[17:14] preached to them the word didn't just go
[17:16] and laying on the ground it didn't go
[17:18] and just returned void but it actually
[17:20] accomplished something something
[17:22] happened when they believed it
[17:25] and that's what a paradox is it's a
[17:28] paradox when something Incredible
[17:29] without a reasonable explanation happens
[17:32] that's what a miracle is a paradox is a
[17:36] miracle when something incredible
[17:37] happens when a tumor falls off when your
[17:40] migraine leaves you
[17:42] I remember one time brother Harris will
[17:44] be years ago was sitting there in the
[17:45] back of the church and he took communion
[17:47] and something happened and he began to
[17:48] run through the church because his back
[17:50] was healed how many of you could
[17:52] remember all the things in your life
[17:54] where you saw something happen because
[17:56] you believed because somebody believed
[17:58] when something it seems incredible and
[18:00] yet it's true that's what a paradox is a
[18:03] statement that is seemingly
[18:05] contradictory or opposed to Common Sense
[18:07] and yet is perhaps true
[18:10] it's a paradox that God can take away a
[18:13] nicotine addiction it's a paradox that
[18:15] somebody could that God can deliver a
[18:17] young man from wanting to smoke
[18:19] marijuana every day and every night that
[18:21] God can deliver somebody from being lazy
[18:24] bones and not wanting to go to work that
[18:26] God can change your character to where
[18:28] you you didn't want to go to church but
[18:30] now all you can do is read the Bible
[18:32] that you can't tear yourself away from
[18:34] it somebody that didn't couldn't take
[18:36] the time to read a long book but now you
[18:39] want to read all the message books you
[18:40] can and that's a paradox it's incredible
[18:43] when the chains come off it's incredible
[18:46] when you're delivered it's incredible
[18:48] when you see somebody that's been in
[18:50] change of pornography that they can't
[18:52] get away from it they don't know what to
[18:54] do and when God delivers them it's a
[18:56] paradox it's a paradox when Freedom
[18:58] comes it's a paradox when Freedom comes
[19:01] to your home it's a paradox when he
[19:03] comes and visits you by your bed at
[19:05] night and all the despair is taken away
[19:08] it's a miracle when you can worship God
[19:11] the way you God intended you to do
[19:15] and whatever I would say a paradox then
[19:17] would be the same as a miracle a paradox
[19:20] within something that seems like it just
[19:22] couldn't be the knowledge of the human
[19:24] mind is altogether incredible but yet
[19:27] it's proven true a miracle will be the
[19:29] same thing for a miracle could not be
[19:32] explained a miracle is something that
[19:34] happens and you cannot explain it that
[19:36] makes it a paradox it's incredible but
[19:39] yet it's the truth and I believe this
[19:41] afternoon we believe we serve a miracle
[19:43] working god let's Elevate our faith
[19:46] let's climb up that ladder to the thing
[19:48] that seems like it's impossible because
[19:50] we believe we serve a God that's going
[19:52] to change our bodies and how can you how
[19:55] can you have faith for a body change if
[19:57] you can barely believe for a toothache
[19:59] God wants you to elevate your faith come
[20:01] up a little bit higher until you can
[20:03] believe that all things are possible to
[20:05] them that believe God is able to heal
[20:07] you if you've been sitting on that
[20:09] sickness for six months or six years it
[20:11] don't matter to God God is still a
[20:14] miracle working God
[20:16] ah you know how I can believe that he's
[20:19] a miracle working God because I'm a
[20:21] miracle have a born-again believer in
[20:24] here is a miracle it's a miracle that
[20:26] God plucked you out of the Wayside and
[20:28] changed your heart and changed your life
[20:30] and if you're not born again this
[20:31] afternoon God can make you a miracle too
[20:34] because he's still a miracle working God
[20:36] all you got to do is just sit there and
[20:38] open up your heart to him just crack
[20:40] that door open a little bit let it come
[20:42] in let him come in and believe and he'll
[20:44] begin to change you he'll come in and
[20:46] Tabernacle himself and make a miracle
[20:48] out of you so that everybody will look
[20:50] at you and say something has happened to
[20:51] that person something that is past my
[20:54] understanding past my intellectual
[20:56] understanding I don't understand how
[20:58] that person that used to cuss and swear
[21:00] and live with the world and love the
[21:02] things of the world now has been changed
[21:04] Something's Happened to him
[21:07] brother Adam said I believe that every
[21:09] born-again member of the body of Christ
[21:10] is a paradox in themselves I believe I
[21:13] believe each one of you methodists and
[21:15] Presbyterian and Lutheran that never had
[21:17] experienced the baptism in the Holy
[21:19] Spirit the Holy Spirit was in some
[21:21] formal church that did not believe in
[21:23] the genuine New Birth and has now
[21:25] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[21:27] is a perfect example of a paragon
[21:29] Paradox because something happened to
[21:32] you something happened to you oh you
[21:35] don't have to raise your hand but how
[21:37] many in here could say I remember when
[21:39] something happened I remember when the
[21:41] Holy Ghost came into my life and it
[21:42] wasn't just something in my mind but it
[21:44] was something that changed my heart and
[21:46] quickened the word that I held in my
[21:48] heart to me something happened to you
[21:50] that changed your whole being and anyone
[21:53] could look at that and know what a
[21:55] paradox is a miracle something happened
[21:58] something happened when Jesus was
[22:00] standing outside of Lazarus grave and he
[22:02] spoke in Lazarus came forth something
[22:04] happened when Peter walked in the water
[22:06] to Jesus she Jesus wouldn't just look
[22:08] Peter wasn't just looking and saying
[22:10] well I'm fine sitting here in the boat
[22:11] but he wanted something to happen and he
[22:14] stood up and he got out of the boat when
[22:16] nobody else would something happened on
[22:18] the day of Pentecost when they were
[22:19] filled with the Holy Ghost it's a
[22:21] miracle that the Holy Ghost didn't take
[22:23] a sinner and change them something
[22:25] happened something happens when you take
[22:27] God at his word and believes if you
[22:29] believe something is going to happen
[22:32] I want to challenge you tonight to take
[22:34] God at his word and see if something
[22:35] won't happen take him at his word take
[22:37] him at his promises and say if you could
[22:39] clothe this pair if you can clothe the
[22:41] Lily I know that you're going to put
[22:43] money in my bank account I know that
[22:45] you're going to provide for me if I
[22:46] don't have a time you're going to take
[22:48] care of me because you can take care of
[22:50] the Lily and you take care of the trees
[22:52] and you take care of the earth you can
[22:54] take care of your bride how many oh
[22:56] can't we look in the confidence of God
[22:58] into God's word with that kind of
[23:01] confidence and know that he's there for
[23:03] you to know what access you have access
[23:06] to the promises it's a miracle how that
[23:09] God can take a man's thinking brother
[23:10] random said and his ways and his life
[23:12] and everything and change it from what
[23:14] it was to what it can be what he can
[23:17] make it to what what it can be what he
[23:20] can make it oh you think about to what
[23:23] it can be to what it can be or not
[23:25] probably ever born again Christian in
[23:27] here is you your confession would
[23:29] probably I ain't where I want to be oh
[23:31] but think what what God wants you to be
[23:33] what it can be what your life can be and
[23:36] there's a miracle working God that's
[23:38] still on the scene to make your life
[23:39] what it can be wherever you are in life
[23:42] if you are living in sin if you're
[23:43] abound in change of this world oh think
[23:46] what God wants your life to be that he
[23:48] wants to make you a miracle he wants to
[23:50] make you a miracle out of you but you
[23:52] would have to agree brother said it's a
[23:54] miracle that God can take someone from
[23:56] the world and change them to be like him
[23:59] and what changed you was not just an
[24:01] intellectual conception it was a power
[24:03] to change your life
[24:06] foreign
[24:07] just look in your look at your own
[24:09] background and think sometimes we think
[24:11] maybe we the devil will come and maybe
[24:14] give us thoughts where you understand
[24:15] these things because it's all in your
[24:17] mind and you're active you're like this
[24:19] wages because it's just it's something
[24:21] natural no but it's supernatural
[24:23] something Supernatural taking place oh
[24:26] you you couldn't understand the things
[24:28] that others probe at you couldn't
[24:30] understand these things unless something
[24:31] Supernatural to happen you couldn't live
[24:33] this Christian Life unless something
[24:35] supernaturally taking place in you
[24:37] that's there's a miracle working God
[24:39] that's doing something
[24:40] after
[24:43] brother I'm told that story of the young
[24:45] German man who was that little boy who
[24:47] was dishonest and he was so Dishonored
[24:49] he could he just couldn't apologize and
[24:52] he'd worked himself up in his
[24:53] intellectuals to try to try to act like
[24:55] it and try to fake it brother said there
[24:58] was a fine young man very fine boy he
[25:00] was going with a little girl very fine
[25:02] little girl out of a fine family and
[25:04] this boy all of a sudden came up with
[25:06] some kind of an idea and he just walked
[25:09] away
[25:09] he did something wrong to the little
[25:11] girl and much has promised her to do a
[25:13] certain thing and then didn't do it and
[25:15] instead of coming to the girl and
[25:16] apologizing like a gentleman should do
[25:18] he it just wasn't in him to do it he
[25:21] wasn't equipped his character hadn't
[25:23] been changed oh you see what a
[25:25] supernatural thing it is for you to be
[25:26] able to apologize for you you to be able
[25:29] to love somebody enough where you can go
[25:30] over to them and say I'm sorry instead
[25:33] of just holding it up and stuff well I
[25:35] don't care I'm spinning around in your
[25:36] mind until you're the right one it's a
[25:38] supernatural thing to be able to love
[25:40] one another it's a supernatural thing to
[25:42] be able to lay down your life to love
[25:44] somebody else the same way that you love
[25:46] yourself to bear with one another to
[25:47] look at somebody else through God's eyes
[25:49] and this young man wasn't equipped
[25:51] brother man said the boy was a Christian
[25:54] as far as a believer he had repented and
[25:57] been baptized and had his position among
[25:59] the Believers but yet and not received
[26:01] the baptism of the Holy Spirit no matter
[26:03] no matter how much he thought he had I I
[26:07] I I I think maybe we could just dwell on
[26:09] that a second that you know the Holy
[26:11] Ghost is going to change you it's going
[26:13] to do something it's it's gonna it's
[26:15] gonna produce an effect in your life and
[26:18] we can sit in church and and act like it
[26:20] all act like we're we're changed but if
[26:22] God hadn't really done a supernatural
[26:24] work in your life you'll never be able
[26:25] to act the way a real true genuine
[26:28] Christian acts because you won't be able
[26:30] to love and you won't be able to forgive
[26:32] and you won't be able to bear with one
[26:33] another and he won't be able to repent
[26:35] the way that a Christian can you won't
[26:37] be able to you won't be able to kneel
[26:39] beside your bed and say forgive me of
[26:40] all those wrongs that I've done and you
[26:42] won't be able to do it you won't be able
[26:44] to do it because it's a supernatural
[26:46] miracle in the life of a born-again
[26:48] Believer where God has actually wrought
[26:50] a wrought a change in your life when
[26:53] you're born again you see you see if you
[26:55] you just if you're just going at home
[26:57] and you gotta you
[26:58] listen if you've got a Tinder account
[27:01] you ain't born again
[27:02] if you gotta if you don't know what a
[27:04] tender account is and just chalk it up
[27:06] to Grace if you don't if you got a
[27:07] tender account and you're going around
[27:09] from house to house you ain't born again
[27:10] if you would rather be at the pool hall
[27:12] The Honky tonker down at the racetrack
[27:14] instead of church you ain't born again
[27:16] if you love that worldly music beat
[27:18] you're sitting in Walmart and you say
[27:19] well I'd like to go I think I'm going to
[27:21] get grow sit in the car and listen to
[27:22] that a little bit longer you ain't Born
[27:24] Again cut your music rock music songs
[27:27] about adultery they don't have no place
[27:29] in a Christian's life why because a
[27:30] Christian is going to be changed a
[27:33] Christian is going to be a changed being
[27:36] I wish we could get away from that eye
[27:38] that the new idea that the new birth is
[27:40] just some private thing that you you
[27:42] just get along and you you say well I I
[27:44] know I'm born again and it's I'm just
[27:46] going to keep this to myself no listen
[27:48] when you're born again you go into that
[27:50] holy of holies you coming out and what
[27:52] are you coming out to do you coming out
[27:54] to share it with the rest of the church
[27:55] and the rest of the people that you work
[27:57] with and you're coming out to share it
[27:59] with with the ministers and everybody's
[28:01] going to know whether you've got the
[28:02] whole Holy Ghost I think sometimes we
[28:05] kind of shy away from that that
[28:06] everybody is going to know whether you
[28:08] got the Holy Ghost the whole world knows
[28:11] if you're born again they might not call
[28:13] it born again but the whole world is
[28:15] going to know whether or not you're born
[28:16] again
[28:17] you know what that's what brother Brown
[28:19] says he said you won't have to go around
[28:21] testifying this that or the other
[28:24] if you're a real lover of the Lord
[28:25] everybody you come in contact with will
[28:28] almost know it
[28:29] you are written Epistles
[28:33] you're sealed and a seal is on the
[28:35] backside the same is on the front side
[28:37] both going and coming people know that
[28:40] you're a Christian
[28:42] you walk different live different act
[28:45] different you are different when you
[28:48] become a Christian
[28:50] how many could agree tonight that when
[28:52] you that you're different when you
[28:53] become a Christian you're going to
[28:54] address different you're going to put
[28:55] away all them worldly things you're
[28:57] going to love the you're going to love
[28:58] the Lord you're going to love reading
[29:00] his word you're going to act different
[29:01] and do different but you see in this
[29:03] case in this little German kid his daddy
[29:05] said it was okay and brother Brown said
[29:07] the father raised up and said my son
[29:09] went to the altar he was baptized
[29:11] correctly in the name of Jesus Christ
[29:13] and water baptism in the pool and said I
[29:17] know my son has come to Christ you see
[29:20] what he was doing he was relying on his
[29:21] natural father to tell him whether or
[29:23] not he was born again God don't want you
[29:25] to rely on your natural anything to tell
[29:27] you whether you're born again he don't
[29:28] want you to rely on a minister and a
[29:30] prayer line to tell you whether you're
[29:31] born again he don't want you to rely on
[29:33] your mama and daddy to tell you whether
[29:34] you're born again you got to hear from
[29:36] your heavenly father to know whether
[29:38] you're born again your Earthly birth is
[29:40] all messed up and you're at that voice
[29:42] that Earthly voice can't tell you
[29:44] whether you're born again or not but
[29:45] that Heavenly voice is going to tell you
[29:47] you wait till you hear that voice of the
[29:49] heavenly father to confirm your birth in
[29:52] Galatians Chapter 4 Verse 6 it says that
[29:54] when you come forth with your new birth
[29:56] you come forth you're going to come
[29:57] forth crying eye but father why because
[30:00] you don't recognize your mama where you
[30:01] come from with your natural birth
[30:03] anymore but you now you come forth the
[30:05] first thing you come forth you you see
[30:07] when you come far from your your
[30:08] spiritual birth is your father you begin
[30:10] to recognize that you've got a personal
[30:12] relationship with him and you know where
[30:14] you came from you know your heavenly
[30:16] father oh if we could just wait to hear
[30:19] from God to speak to us whether or not
[30:20] we're born again then wait for somebody
[30:22] to go give us the Glad hand to
[30:24] fellowship and give us a attaboy on the
[30:26] back of the back and say well I think
[30:27] you got it no you you need to sit by the
[30:30] bed and pray and cry a little bit and
[30:32] find out whether find out whether God
[30:34] has really accepted your faith or not
[30:36] find out whether God is really quick in
[30:38] the word that you think that you've held
[30:40] Bill around said I said that may be all
[30:42] right all the outward emotions he might
[30:44] be identified as a Believer with the
[30:46] Believers but until he is regenerated
[30:48] born again
[30:50] I'd advise that young man to never marry
[30:53] a woman
[30:56] excuse me he'll make hell on Earth for
[30:59] her until that gentle sweet forgiving
[31:02] Spirit of Christ comes in
[31:04] oh my to think that without the new
[31:06] birth marriage would be hell on Earth
[31:09] to think that without a change in your
[31:10] life marriage would be hell on Earth
[31:12] without the new birth you can't forgive
[31:14] without the new birth you can't express
[31:16] right
[31:17] oh that's that's the path to peace if
[31:21] you want peace in your home and peace in
[31:23] your marriage get get closer to Christ
[31:25] you know we talk about Oneness so much
[31:27] and if so so many I think I've gotten
[31:30] confused that if we can just agree with
[31:31] one another then we'll be one but no let
[31:34] us agree with Christ I want to agree
[31:36] with Christ if I can get into him then
[31:38] we'll begin to agree with one another
[31:40] he's the main thing without the new
[31:42] birth you can't express Christ without
[31:44] the new birth
[31:45] without the new birth everything just
[31:47] becomes chaos that's what brother Brown
[31:49] said then with that then that will be a
[31:51] paradox in itself to take the very
[31:54] nature of a boy that's bred between
[31:56] father and mother and yet in his
[31:58] intellectuals he is trying his best to
[32:00] overcome it he can't do it
[32:03] oh you see why it's a miracle now
[32:06] it's a miracle because you can't you
[32:08] can't in your own self you can't
[32:09] overcome it how you gonna get away from
[32:12] that pornography demon how are you going
[32:14] to get away from adultery and
[32:16] fornication and the lust of Flesh and
[32:18] the pride of life how are you going to
[32:20] get away from that suicidal demon that
[32:22] makes you tries to get you to cut
[32:23] yourself or how you that listen there's
[32:26] a long list of things that we could
[32:27] unroll that how you going to get away
[32:30] from that the only way you're going to
[32:32] get away from it it's got to be a
[32:33] supernatural work it's got to be a
[32:36] miracle that's what I believe I believe
[32:38] in a miracle working God and if you need
[32:40] a miracle tonight there's a God that's
[32:42] ready to give you your miracle if you
[32:44] need Freedom tonight there's a God
[32:45] that's ready to step on the scene for
[32:47] you right now and give it to you he said
[32:50] he'll never overcome a Christ we'll have
[32:52] to overcome it when he lets Christ in
[32:54] that he's already overcome then it'll be
[32:57] a perfect Paradox when a man is born of
[33:00] the spirit of God it takes the Miracle
[33:02] of Life to overcome your Earthly genes
[33:04] you know that's what the the new birth
[33:06] is doing is actually changing your
[33:09] character it's correcting your Earthly
[33:12] birth it's correcting it everything
[33:14] that's wrong with your Earthly birth is
[33:16] correcting it it's correcting that
[33:18] temper it's correcting that lack of
[33:20] patience it's correcting all those
[33:22] things all the way the things that you
[33:24] didn't act right the way that you
[33:26] couldn't treat somebody right is
[33:27] correcting that and changing it and it's
[33:29] a paradox that God can take your own
[33:32] carnal horrible nature and change it to
[33:35] be like him that God can make a stubborn
[33:38] person understanding somebody that
[33:40] cabbages down and say well I ain't gonna
[33:42] listen to nothing that that preacher
[33:44] tells me I ain't gonna listen to that I
[33:46] don't care whether it's truth or not I
[33:47] ain't gonna listen like like Cain almost
[33:49] that God could take somebody like that
[33:52] and make them understanding and make him
[33:54] patient and loving that God could take a
[33:57] quick tempered person and make them
[33:59] patient and kind somebody that's got a
[34:01] Tipper like a bug saw God can make an
[34:04] evil-hearted man somebody like that man
[34:06] that was ready to kill that little that
[34:08] little doe when brother brother Brown
[34:09] and make them loving and sweet natured
[34:13] oh tell me that ain't a miracle that's a
[34:15] miracle that God can do that
[34:17] and we're I'm looking at a lot of
[34:19] Miracles sitting here tonight that God
[34:21] can bring an Unapologetic heart up to
[34:23] the altar that God can make it a
[34:25] hard-hearted man come to a place where
[34:27] they apologize and repent you know
[34:29] that's a miracle somebody with old cold
[34:32] stunning heart that don't want to listen
[34:33] to nothing about the gospel and the
[34:35] gospel can soften it up to where they
[34:37] you see tears falling down their face
[34:39] and hands lifted up ready to receive his
[34:42] word that God can make a hard-hearted
[34:44] woman come up to the altar oh we need
[34:48] the new birth we need a miracle we need
[34:51] a paradox in our life God is a god of
[34:53] paradoxes
[34:55] oh the new birth is your foundation and
[34:57] you say it's everything to a Believer
[34:59] it's the foundation of your Christian
[35:00] walk it's the foundation of your life
[35:02] it'll be the foundation of your marriage
[35:04] and that's why brother Brown told George
[35:06] Smith you can get engaged to her to
[35:08] Rebecca but you can't but you need to
[35:10] get born again before you get married
[35:12] why because you need a character change
[35:14] if you want to have a successful
[35:16] marriage if you want to have a
[35:17] successful anything you need a character
[35:19] change
[35:21] you need a miracle in your life it takes
[35:23] God to bring a miracle
[35:25] but we've got a God that can change
[35:27] things
[35:30] oh come on now let me meddle a little
[35:32] bit now listen
[35:33] listen if if the Holy Ghost changes your
[35:36] character your Earthly character to
[35:38] Heavenly if it corrects it if it's
[35:40] correcting all that and see what good
[35:42] are all these horoscopes and things what
[35:45] good are all these astrology things
[35:46] because at best the horoscope is looking
[35:48] to your natural lineage at best you look
[35:51] up in the sky and say well I got my
[35:52] temper or I got my temperament or
[35:54] whatever from my mom and daddy because I
[35:57] was born on this certain day or whatever
[35:58] because the the uh it was it was uh
[36:01] three o'clock in the afternoon when I
[36:03] was born or whatever it was and you look
[36:05] up and you can see maybe you can jar
[36:07] maybe if they're at best if there is any
[36:09] value in a horoscope it'll tell you some
[36:12] insight into your natural birth but I
[36:15] ain't concerned with my natural birth I
[36:17] want to look up to the heaven you know
[36:18] brother Brian said in the Stars
[36:20] every person in the Bible was written in
[36:23] the stars but not the way a horoscope's
[36:25] written because the the Bible the Stars
[36:28] tell you to tell you the whole journey
[36:30] of redemption from Christ coming to
[36:32] Virgo to the urging all the way to the
[36:35] Aquarius the water Bearer I'll pour out
[36:37] my spirit on All Flesh all the way to
[36:39] his return that lead or the lion and if
[36:41] you can identify yourself in that star
[36:44] and those Stars that's what I where I
[36:47] want to be identified and I want to be
[36:48] identified in a changed life not so not
[36:52] my carnal history not my not where I
[36:54] came from in my Earthly Journey but I
[36:56] want to be identified in Christ
[36:59] brother Brown said I've seen critics
[37:01] stand off and make fun and carry on up a
[37:03] holy ghost Revival and after a while god
[37:06] get a hold of that same man and change
[37:08] him and here he stands right in the
[37:10] Pulpit preaching the same thing that he
[37:11] once hated
[37:12] it's a paradox how that God can take the
[37:15] unbeliever and make a Believer out of
[37:16] you
[37:17] something happened to you that changed
[37:20] your whole being
[37:21] and anyone could look at that and know
[37:23] what a paradox is
[37:25] a miracle
[37:26] oh you think about that that anyone
[37:28] could look at your life and know that
[37:30] that's that's got to be a miracle
[37:32] oh we could go around the room and tell
[37:34] all the testimonies about where you came
[37:35] from and and and and and the and the and
[37:39] the places that the devil got us from in
[37:40] life and surely you know look doesn't
[37:43] that build your faith to know that you
[37:45] can't be in the place that you're in
[37:46] right now if God hadn't wrought a
[37:47] miracle in your life and he's if he's
[37:50] able to do all that think about what
[37:51] he's at where he's able to take you from
[37:53] here is if he's able to take you from
[37:55] there to here
[37:56] surely he's able to take you from here
[37:58] to a body change if we're believing
[38:00] because if you believe something's going
[38:02] to happen
[38:04] something's going to happen brother
[38:06] Brian said if God ever gets a hold of an
[38:07] individual
[38:09] there was there's something that will
[38:10] control their emotions to the word
[38:12] something that will cause them to Humble
[38:14] themselves to Emer to the word
[38:17] it's a miracle to see your son or
[38:19] daughter of God surrender to the word
[38:21] and change by the word
[38:23] you get everything everything the word
[38:26] is holds everything together the word is
[38:28] what holds your life together the word
[38:30] is what holds the cosmos together
[38:32] you know you see what I'm building up to
[38:34] because the cosmo the are the stars and
[38:37] the planets were standing there and it
[38:39] was held together by the word and Joshua
[38:41] took a step back and said I believe
[38:42] God's word and if God's word is able to
[38:45] hold it together God's word is able to
[38:47] move it God's word is able to keep it
[38:49] still God's word is able to control it
[38:52] it's a paradox that the word the word
[38:54] holds everything together in Hebrews 11
[38:56] 3 it says through faith we understand
[38:58] that the worlds were framed by the word
[39:00] of God so the things which were seen
[39:02] were not made were not made of things
[39:05] which do appear the worlds were framed
[39:07] by a miracle my brother said how it
[39:11] stands in space so much we can say to
[39:13] that take hours upon it but we find out
[39:15] here that Joshua will stop in the sun
[39:17] now that's a paradox it's a paradox but
[39:20] God did it anyhow what by a man not a
[39:24] God not some great angel coming down
[39:25] from heaven a man with faith in the
[39:28] mission that he was given to take that
[39:29] land the word of God was behind it I
[39:32] give you this land and everywhere The
[39:35] Souls of your foot Shall Set upon that I
[39:37] give you it's yours footsteps meant
[39:40] possession now that's a great story for
[39:42] Joshua now but you can have that shame
[39:44] that same power in your life if you look
[39:46] into God's word and say
[39:49] that God I know God has given me this
[39:53] land I know God has promised me my
[39:56] children I know God has promised me the
[39:59] baptism of the Holy Ghost I know that
[40:02] God has promised me adoption because
[40:04] this is the season for adoption this is
[40:07] a season for somebody to come to a
[40:08] Capstone Revelation this is the season
[40:10] for it and I know I know God has problem
[40:13] come on now let's look into the word and
[40:15] accept your promises accept your
[40:17] benefits whatever the word says you can
[40:19] have you can have it if you believe it
[40:21] because God is a god of Miracles and he
[40:23] wants you to he wants you to ask for
[40:25] difficult things don't you remember that
[40:27] quote but I said God don't want you to
[40:29] ask for simple things he wants you to
[40:31] ask for hard things he wants you to ask
[40:33] to feel to help you with that with that
[40:35] car payment that you're struggling with
[40:36] he wants you to ask to to grow up the
[40:39] statue of a perfect man he wants to ask
[40:41] you for you to ask him to take away all
[40:43] that stuff that you've been struggling
[40:45] with
[40:47] the achievement he was trying to do
[40:49] brother Adam said see his enemy was
[40:51] routed and he knew if the son ever said
[40:53] them Kings would get together and they'd
[40:55] come back upon him with double forces so
[40:57] the sun was going down and Joshua a man
[41:00] commanded to do this said Son stand
[41:02] still why because he was looking at the
[41:04] enemy and he said I know that God wants
[41:06] me to defeat this enemy and his word is
[41:08] promised this we're going to the
[41:09] promised land aren't you going to the
[41:11] promised land sitting here tonight
[41:13] you're on your way to the promised land
[41:14] so don't let any devil stand in your way
[41:17] and the devil get in your way and tell
[41:19] you you can't overcome that it ain't for
[41:22] you cast down reasons cast down
[41:24] imaginations cast down every vain
[41:27] thought cast down everything that the
[41:28] devil throws at you brother Raymond said
[41:30] whatever God did I don't know but the
[41:33] sun Stood Still the moon over agilon
[41:35] because a man a human being a human
[41:38] being was in the line of duty how are
[41:40] you going to be in the line of duty this
[41:42] afternoon you get in the word because
[41:43] the word is his will and the word shows
[41:46] you what God wants done and if you know
[41:48] what God wants done if you know that his
[41:50] promises are to you and that you've got
[41:53] access to it and something is bound to
[41:56] change because you're in the line of
[41:58] duty just like Joshua was you begin to
[42:00] speak the words just like Joshua did
[42:02] because you know what the word says you
[42:04] begin to speak it you begin to speak it
[42:07] beside your bed at night but you begin
[42:08] to speak it behind the steering wheel in
[42:10] your car at your drive to work you begin
[42:12] to speak it in the morning when you rise
[42:14] up when the sun's coming up behind the
[42:16] hill but over the hill because you know
[42:18] what God wants done come on now it's
[42:21] adoption time God wants children to God
[42:23] that know what he wants done with the
[42:25] word how many needs to change this
[42:27] afternoon how many wants a miracle God
[42:30] is looking for somebody that he can use
[42:32] like Joshua he's looking for somebody
[42:34] that'll get in the line of duty
[42:36] and Joshua knew he was in the line of
[42:39] duty
[42:40] he had a reason brother Ryan said of
[42:43] course you've got to have a reason for
[42:44] it you can't have faith unless you got
[42:46] some kind of reason as I tried to say
[42:49] last night some people's faith is in
[42:50] their textbook some people's faith is in
[42:53] something else but depends on what your
[42:54] faith is
[42:56] sometimes we doubt the reason that God's
[42:57] given we look in the Bible and we read
[42:59] that we've got to benefit package and we
[43:00] think well I don't know if God's gonna
[43:02] forgive my iniquity I don't know if he
[43:04] loves me enough to heal all my diseases
[43:06] but it's laying there in the word if you
[43:08] can just believe it if you can just
[43:10] believe it then the god of Miracles will
[43:12] come upon the scene and do something
[43:14] here something is going to happen his
[43:16] will shows the reason brother Brown said
[43:18] I want to believe God's word what he
[43:19] says is truth and I've got to see
[43:21] whether it's his will or not despite all
[43:24] the other influences despite what my
[43:26] eyes can see I want to see what his will
[43:27] says about it and his will is his word
[43:30] in Matthew chapter 6 he said Jesus said
[43:33] to pray like this thy kingdom come thy
[43:35] will be done in earth as it is in heaven
[43:38] foreign
[43:39] Matthew chapter 7 verse 21 not everyone
[43:41] that saith unto me Lord Lord so enter
[43:43] into the kingdom of heaven but he that
[43:44] doeth the will of My Father which is in
[43:46] heaven and we've got his will we've got
[43:49] his will because his will is his word in
[43:51] Psalm chapter 33 it says the counsel of
[43:53] the Lord his word standeth forever the
[43:55] thoughts of his heart to all generations
[43:57] so if you're to stay with his will
[44:00] something's going to happen
[44:02] sometimes it's kind of hard to stay with
[44:04] his will
[44:05] like that Prophet there in the Bible
[44:06] that that God told him to go over here
[44:09] and speak up speak a word I think it was
[44:11] the prophecy about Josiah in the Bible
[44:13] there and he he told him don't you turn
[44:15] to the rider to the left you just keep
[44:17] on going
[44:18] and God tested him a little bit he told
[44:20] another Prophet to go tell that tell him
[44:21] tell him turn aside he said unto him I
[44:23] am a prophet also was Thou Art and an
[44:25] angel speaking to me by the word of the
[44:27] Lord saying bring him back with thee
[44:29] into thine house that he may eat bread
[44:31] and drink water but he lied unto him see
[44:34] you don't deviate to the left or the
[44:36] right you stay right with God's word and
[44:38] sometimes that's a hard lesson for us to
[44:40] learn that you got to ignore all the
[44:42] other influences in your life but you
[44:44] have to look straight to God's word I
[44:46] was talking to somebody recently about
[44:48] you know when I started preaching you
[44:49] know you'd hear this one preacher over
[44:50] here say I can't preach unless I'm
[44:53] nervous when I'm when I stop being
[44:54] nervous then I'm going to stop preaching
[44:56] and then you hear this other preacher
[44:57] over here say well I never get nervous
[44:59] and so that's the way you got to do you
[45:01] gotta if you don't if you get nervous
[45:03] you you can't preach and so you now
[45:05] you've got those two opposing things so
[45:07] which is right well listen you got to
[45:09] have your own experience you got to find
[45:11] out what works you everybody's got to
[45:13] fight you look at you look into the word
[45:15] for your own self and you have your own
[45:17] experience because you can't rely on
[45:19] anybody else's experience listen when
[45:22] your friend says it ain't worth it you
[45:23] just keep your eye right on the word
[45:25] when your family says you can't be
[45:27] healed and everybody that you know says
[45:29] it ain't gonna work for you keep your
[45:30] eyes right on the word of God oh when a
[45:33] minister says you can't be save maybe
[45:35] because of some circumstantial thing
[45:36] that they think that binds you from
[45:38] being saved maybe because you maybe
[45:39] because your mother and father weren't
[45:41] married when you're when you were born
[45:42] or whatever all this nonsense that's
[45:44] going around when a minister says you
[45:45] can't be saved you cast that aside and
[45:48] you look straight to God's word oh when
[45:50] the internet says it can't be true you
[45:52] cast it aside and you just stay straight
[45:54] with God's word
[45:56] I was reading one of them articles the
[45:58] other day just because I kind of like
[45:59] doing that as a Pastime just to see it
[46:01] so I know what they're saying I I'm I'm
[46:05] not afraid I wouldn't encourage
[46:06] everybody to do that but listen there's
[46:08] it's I I anyway my point
[46:11] I was reading one of the things where
[46:13] they were where they were telling a
[46:14] story about brother Branham and and I
[46:16] was reading I was and I and they were
[46:18] just casting him in a terrible light and
[46:20] I don't remember all the details of the
[46:22] thing right now at this particular
[46:23] moment but I I went and I started to
[46:25] research it for myself and everything
[46:27] that they said it was lies everything
[46:29] they said that brother Brown said that
[46:31] this that he was saying that uh it was
[46:33] what he what they were saying was that
[46:35] he had said that that uh how do you
[46:37] write this little girl that was in that
[46:38] wheelchair that brother around spoke
[46:40] healing in her and she died in that
[46:42] wheelchair but you go back and see what
[46:43] brother Brown said he never he said if
[46:45] if the Lord told me to say it if the
[46:47] Lord told me to say it I would seek it
[46:49] speak it but he never spoke healing over
[46:51] her hey and if if he did if he would
[46:54] have she'd come out of that wheelchair
[46:56] but he never did it the way that they
[46:58] said see they're telling lies and you
[47:00] got to go see if oh that's why we need
[47:03] to file full ministry because a
[47:04] five-fold Ministry gonna search that
[47:06] stuff out and study it and make it
[47:08] easier on you make it easy so you don't
[47:10] get fooled by all this nonsense and
[47:12] somebody is a lot of people just get
[47:15] fooled because they they just don't they
[47:16] they're not uh how how can you say it
[47:19] that that they're not capable of
[47:21] studying or whatever whatever you want
[47:23] to say but the fair is a Firefall
[47:25] Ministry that'll study it out for it go
[47:26] ask somebody if you're if you're getting
[47:28] if you're getting swayed by all these
[47:30] all this nonsense that people say
[47:32] because it's lies it's a bunch of Lies
[47:35] it's lies about the bridge that's why I
[47:37] don't even like saying well if you could
[47:39] tell me that brother Branham did do
[47:41] something wrong I'm still going to
[47:43] believe because brother Branham didn't
[47:45] do those things that he said that they
[47:47] did he didn't go sleeping around he
[47:50] didn't he he said the right thing about
[47:52] how many fell off those Bridge
[47:53] everything that he said was correct
[47:55] everything that he said was correct you
[47:58] can't if you would just keep your eyes
[48:01] on Christ keep your eyes on his word
[48:03] keep your eyes on his will and don't
[48:05] look at nobody else keep your eyes trade
[48:08] on him and brother said in the message
[48:09] perseverance you must first find the
[48:11] will of God before you can do the will
[48:13] of God you must first know what his will
[48:15] is in the matter and then don't turn it
[48:17] loose and the token he said he cannot go
[48:19] contrary to that word he has already
[48:21] purchased your desire if it's according
[48:22] to his will and his will is to heal his
[48:26] will is to give you your desire his will
[48:28] is to work a miracle in your life his
[48:31] will is to change you to make you like
[48:33] him that if his will I got to check out
[48:36] my objective to it and then my motive in
[48:39] doing it
[48:40] if I do it brother said because I say
[48:42] well I'm going over the mountain here
[48:43] there's a mountain before me there's a
[48:45] million people on that side perishing I
[48:47] got a hundred million over here I'm
[48:48] preaching to well if I can't get over
[48:50] around or under the mountain or nothing
[48:52] and yet something in my heart keep
[48:54] telling me go over the mountain go to
[48:55] them go to them they can't get over it
[48:57] now Jesus said they shall move this
[49:00] mountain oh you see if you got the right
[49:02] motive if you're asking for the right
[49:04] thing and not because you want to get
[49:06] rich not because you want people to pay
[49:08] you money not because of popularity but
[49:11] everyone said what if I say no I don't
[49:13] care about the money but when I get over
[49:14] there someday the ages to come they'll
[49:17] put up a great big Monument say brother
[49:18] Brown I'm the great missionary and steal
[49:21] my motive is not right
[49:23] laughs oh popularity is what gets so
[49:27] many to the side
[49:28] I won't preach to get singing so I'll
[49:30] get more likes I won't preach against
[49:32] sin so I'll get more attaboys what what
[49:34] does it matter how many views we get on
[49:36] the internet what does it matter how
[49:37] many messages we get about how good we
[49:39] preach oh you just you got to put you
[49:41] got to put the good and the bad up on us
[49:43] on a little shelf don't don't let the
[49:46] things say that people say about you
[49:48] have have nothing to do with your what
[49:51] what people say has nothing to do with
[49:53] whether you're successful or not you
[49:55] know how you'll know you're a success on
[49:57] the uh when you get beyond the curtain
[49:59] of time and Jesus says I well done thou
[50:02] good and faithful servant when you hear
[50:04] well doing it without goodness that's
[50:06] what I want to hear
[50:07] we're not preaching for attaboys we're
[50:10] not trying to get likes and and all
[50:12] those things but brother Brown said when
[50:13] I don't care if they ever know he went
[50:15] over there he's just in my heart then
[50:17] I'll speak to that mountain it'll happen
[50:20] see it's got to see your motive and your
[50:23] objective depends on who you are and
[50:25] what business that's where the church
[50:27] misses it so far they get worked up in
[50:29] an emotion and first thing you know and
[50:32] enthusiasm you don't stop to check it
[50:34] back here again check there for sure
[50:37] then it's the saith the Lord
[50:40] if you got the right reason
[50:42] the right objective and you know you're
[50:44] in a will of God something is bound to
[50:47] happen
[50:48] something's going to happen
[50:50] oh you think about that tonight when you
[50:52] go home if you got a right reason for
[50:53] the for for what you're praying for if
[50:56] if you've got a right if you're praying
[50:57] for your kids to do well in school you
[50:59] got a right reason if you're praying for
[51:02] the right objective if you're praying
[51:03] for a good Godly spouse a good Godly
[51:06] husband that'll be ahead of your family
[51:08] a good Godly wife that'll raise your
[51:10] children right
[51:11] that mountain is going to move God's
[51:13] God's got to do something
[51:15] amen
[51:16] Moses had a commission to bring those
[51:18] people out of Egypt Joshua had a
[51:20] commission to go over and take that land
[51:22] and God caused a great prayer about
[51:24] Paradox and you've got a commission you
[51:25] know what a commission is
[51:27] a commission is constitutes documentary
[51:30] Authority that the person named is
[51:34] vested with the powers of that office
[51:36] and is empowered to execute official
[51:39] Acts
[51:40] like an officer in the Army gets a
[51:42] commission that you can go and you're
[51:44] fighting and making decisions on behalf
[51:46] of the country that you live in and if
[51:48] you've got a commission what is your
[51:49] commission our commission as ministers
[51:51] just go into all the world and preach
[51:52] the gospel and cast out devils and signs
[51:55] and wonders are going to follow that's
[51:57] our commission that that you preach the
[51:59] word it's going to have an effect and
[52:01] you've got a commission your commission
[52:03] is it's written to go speak and go
[52:05] forward your commission is all these
[52:08] things laying here in the Bible
[52:10] the trouble of it is today brother Brown
[52:12] said the churches speak look like say
[52:14] what did Moody say what did Sankey say
[52:16] but what did God say
[52:19] speak and say what God said let's go
[52:22] forward not look back
[52:24] but go this way
[52:26] and it was a paradox when Noah preached
[52:28] the word to a scientific age and Noah
[52:31] had a commission what was his commission
[52:33] destruction is coming get in the ark
[52:36] amen oh you see what what a paradox that
[52:38] was when Noah began to preach and he
[52:40] preached and he preached until finally
[52:42] rain came and they didn't know where the
[52:43] rain came
[52:45] Noah preached to an intellectual world
[52:47] like we're preaching to now
[52:49] Noah preached to a world that would sit
[52:51] there and say well I don't believe that
[52:53] God is able to do it a world that was so
[52:55] intellectual in their conception that
[52:57] they failed to believe that God was
[52:58] still a god of Miracles
[53:00] Noah preached it to a day when they were
[53:02] father advanced in science than we are
[53:04] now
[53:05] you think about a day where they could
[53:07] build a great pyramid and move those
[53:08] great blocks and had all those great
[53:10] scientific advancements and Noah was
[53:12] preaching in that day when nobody wanted
[53:15] to listen to him preaching about
[53:16] something that they could prove by their
[53:18] science they could look up and say well
[53:20] there ain't no rain in the heavens say
[53:22] it like this there ain't no going to be
[53:24] no body change how's God going to change
[53:26] your body how's God going to perform a
[53:28] change oh you see what God's Building us
[53:31] up to if God can change us from there to
[53:33] the here God is going to change us from
[53:36] here to there God is going to change
[53:38] because God is a god of Miracles you see
[53:41] his time his time to get in the ark and
[53:43] what is the art the ark is this message
[53:45] that we've heard a message that's going
[53:47] to transform us from that Old World that
[53:50] old carnal world into a new world a new
[53:52] place a new a new situation where we
[53:55] step out into a body change you all they
[53:57] got in that Ark and they they went from
[53:59] they went from point B O A to Port B all
[54:01] right they saw the water come and wash
[54:03] away all their troubles washed away all
[54:05] that cardinality wash away all those
[54:07] people that didn't believe and washed
[54:09] away all those people living in sin and
[54:11] mocking and but they were screaming on
[54:13] the doors when those when that when God
[54:14] shut the door
[54:17] thank God you see thank God for a
[54:19] message of Grace a message of Grace that
[54:22] we've heard it was a message of Grace
[54:23] that Noah was preaching to come get in
[54:26] the ark that scrush Destruction has come
[54:28] and get in the ark and it's a message of
[54:30] Grace that we've heard like if we if we
[54:32] hadn't received this message from God
[54:34] you think about we like the Bible says
[54:36] we'd be blind leading the blind it was a
[54:38] blind leading the blind until we heard
[54:40] this message that God has given to us we
[54:42] didn't know we wouldn't have known what
[54:44] to do we wouldn't have known how many
[54:46] gods there were if God was in three
[54:48] people or one we would have known we
[54:50] wouldn't have any how to be baptized how
[54:53] to dress that how to be healed how to
[54:55] receive the new birth we would have been
[54:57] like the blind leading the blind but
[54:59] we've heard a message of Grace now you
[55:01] see why we're not lifting up men we're
[55:03] not lifting up a man but we're lifting
[55:06] up a message to say thank God for the
[55:08] grace of God to come down in our lives
[55:10] Noah was the only one to have the word
[55:13] in that day Noah only had the word of
[55:16] the Lord and the face of all of their
[55:18] signs in that day Noah was the only one
[55:21] in that day to have the word against all
[55:23] their instruments Noah had a revelation
[55:26] of the will of God and you think about
[55:27] who's got the word in this day
[55:29] there's only one place one Ark one door
[55:34] you can go through one place that you
[55:37] can hear the message of Grace to get
[55:39] into that Ark oh think about a miracle
[55:41] you talk about a miracle a miracle that
[55:43] you're sitting here how many people have
[55:45] you tried to witness to and just talked
[55:46] about things just at a basic level and
[55:49] they just can't see it but you've heard
[55:50] it and you believe that you're sitting
[55:52] here it's a miracle that you're sitting
[55:54] here it was a miracle that eight people
[55:56] were in that Ark with all the millions
[55:58] sitting outside it was a miracle that
[56:01] the flood that the door shuttle and Noah
[56:03] no one didn't know how to shut that door
[56:04] he built that door and I can imagine him
[56:08] looking up at that door it's too big I
[56:10] don't have the instruments to shut this
[56:11] thing I I can't I can't lever it into
[56:13] place I don't know and he went to sleep
[56:15] one night and woke up the next morning
[56:17] and God had shut that door and it was a
[56:19] miracle and everything in Noah's life
[56:21] was a miracle when the rain fell on the
[56:23] on the day that it fell it was a miracle
[56:25] after all maybe his family sitting up
[56:28] there began to doubt and everything
[56:29] wondering if the message was really true
[56:31] and the rain began to fall and they
[56:34] begin to hear the thunder claps and the
[56:36] screams on the outside as people began
[56:38] to beat on that Ark and it was a miracle
[56:40] as a miracle as a as that Arc carried
[56:43] him around the earth and the door opened
[56:45] on the other side of the uh of the globe
[56:47] or wherever they were on Mount Airy and
[56:51] now if they came into a new world
[56:53] not all because that Noah had a
[56:55] revelation of the will of God he knew it
[56:57] was going to rain
[56:59] how you think about the place you're
[57:01] sitting in right now he knew destruction
[57:03] was coming
[57:04] he knew the way of Escape
[57:06] and he knew he was going to build an ark
[57:09] he had his commission oh you see now you
[57:11] got your commission you're commissioned
[57:13] to build
[57:15] your commission you know the way of
[57:17] Escape you know the capstone's got to
[57:20] come you know the only way out is this
[57:22] message he we know the destruction is
[57:25] coming because that's what Malachi 456
[57:27] says that there's got to come Elijah
[57:28] before the great and Dreadful day of the
[57:30] Lord that's got to cut you say you say
[57:33] well I wonder if this message is true
[57:35] then tell me what that scripture means
[57:37] tell me what Revelation 10 means if it
[57:39] matters to you tell me what Luke 17 30
[57:41] means if it matters to you they never
[57:44] had rain but Noah said it's going to
[57:46] rain the water was on the earth not in
[57:49] the skies they could take an instrument
[57:50] and prove there was no water there but
[57:52] Noah said it's going to happen anyhow
[57:55] see and it rained see it don't matter
[57:57] how many aches and pains there are in
[57:59] your body if your knees are popping one
[58:02] of my daughters told me the other day
[58:03] Dad I can tell when you're coming up the
[58:04] stairs because I hear your knee pop but
[58:06] see that don't matter
[58:09] that don't matter because it's going to
[58:11] happen anyhow
[58:13] our bodies are going to be changed
[58:15] there's a God of Miracles if God has
[58:17] brought us from there to here God is
[58:19] able to change our bodies he said that
[58:21] was a paradox see something that could
[58:23] not be explained but God shook the Earth
[58:25] around just in conditions so it would
[58:27] rain so you see it was a paradox for God
[58:31] for Noah to do that
[58:32] oh you see why we've got to believe in
[58:34] miracles we've got to believe in a
[58:37] miracle working God oh don't just come
[58:38] to church and just cabbage down and say
[58:40] well I'm sitting here while
[58:42] he won't fail to see
[58:44] the working God I think we should come
[58:46] to church expecting to see Miracles we
[58:48] should come to certain Church expecting
[58:50] to see God move that should be our
[58:52] expectation why because you're a paradox
[58:54] and if you're a paradox then surely you
[58:57] can believe in paradoxes because God has
[58:59] changed you he's worked a miracle in
[59:01] your life and surely you can expect more
[59:03] miracles surely you can expect signs and
[59:06] wonders if you yourself are a sign and a
[59:08] Wonder
[59:09] God did it that way because he was going
[59:12] to do it again in the last days God
[59:14] worked all those things out in Noah's
[59:16] life the preaching of the message come
[59:19] and get in the ark the door shut and all
[59:21] those things because he was going to do
[59:22] the same thing again in the last days
[59:24] as the days of Noah were so also shall
[59:27] the coming of the son of man be for as
[59:29] in the days that were before the flood
[59:30] they were eating and drinking
[59:32] marrying and giving in marriage getting
[59:35] married and getting divorced until the
[59:37] day that Noah entered into the ark
[59:39] they're still carrying on their lives it
[59:40] looked like everything was going on
[59:42] normal and it's going everything looks
[59:44] like you look outside and people don't
[59:45] know anything about what I'm talking
[59:47] about right now just like they did in
[59:49] Noah's day and ignore the gospel truth
[59:51] and knew not until the flood came and
[59:54] took them all away so shall also the
[59:56] coming of the son of man be
[59:58] God will send a message in the midst of
[1:00:01] a scientific age of disbelief a message
[1:00:04] what to catch us away just like that
[1:00:07] message in Noah's day caught them away a
[1:00:10] message of a miracle a miracle-working
[1:00:13] message to catch eight people away and
[1:00:16] as it was in that day so shall it be in
[1:00:19] this day when the coming of the son of
[1:00:20] man it was a secret catching away in
[1:00:23] that day and it's going to be a secret
[1:00:24] catching away in this day the most evil
[1:00:27] scientific age oh don't look for nothing
[1:00:29] else to happen
[1:00:31] how you've already been purged you've
[1:00:34] already been washed you've already been
[1:00:36] cleansed you've already been filled
[1:00:37] you've already been made ready and let
[1:00:39] me say it like this the word is
[1:00:41] sufficient you don't need nothing else
[1:00:43] to happen to you to cleanse you out you
[1:00:45] don't need anything else to make you
[1:00:47] ready the word is sufficient for you the
[1:00:50] word is sufficient for the bride the
[1:00:52] word is everything that the bride needs
[1:00:54] to make herself ready oh isn't that what
[1:00:56] was revealed in the fifth and sixth
[1:00:57] seals that the word has washed you and
[1:00:59] made you clean the word has purified you
[1:01:01] the word has cleansed you and that's all
[1:01:04] you need to be made ready is the word
[1:01:06] the word is everything that you had need
[1:01:08] of just like it was in Noah's day and
[1:01:11] Noah Noah couldn't prove by there and
[1:01:13] let what he was saying they couldn't
[1:01:15] prove by there in late well all he had
[1:01:17] to do all he had was the word and he
[1:01:20] based everything on the word
[1:01:22] when he said get in the ark
[1:01:24] he preached a message to get into the
[1:01:26] ark
[1:01:27] why did he preach that message
[1:01:29] because he knew there was going to be
[1:01:30] somebody to get in
[1:01:32] you think about that that this message
[1:01:34] was sent because God knew somebody was
[1:01:36] going to get in the yard
[1:01:38] I think I'm looking at I'm sitting here
[1:01:40] tonight some God knew somebody was going
[1:01:42] to receive it
[1:01:43] oh aren't you glad tonight for a miracle
[1:01:46] working God that sent a miracle message
[1:01:48] still work a miracle in your life
[1:01:51] to save you and call you and move you
[1:01:54] into that Ark where would you be if this
[1:01:56] message hadn't come
[1:01:58] where would you be sitting right now you
[1:02:00] ever thought about that what would you
[1:02:01] what would you be doing right now maybe
[1:02:02] you'd be sitting in front of front of
[1:02:04] your TV at home watching some some movie
[1:02:07] that ain't gonna do nothing but corrupt
[1:02:08] your mind watching something watching
[1:02:10] some newscast that just goes around and
[1:02:11] around every day it's the same old thing
[1:02:13] more bad things more bad things you just
[1:02:15] pollute your mind
[1:02:16] but we're sitting here listening and
[1:02:18] feasting on the words of life or to
[1:02:20] think of his grace
[1:02:22] to think of God's race
[1:02:26] oh and in that day people didn't want to
[1:02:28] get into the ark they didn't want to get
[1:02:29] in the ark because they didn't like Noah
[1:02:31] and the same day people don't want to
[1:02:33] get in the yard because they're they've
[1:02:35] they've heard all this hypocritical
[1:02:36] stuff all this lies about brother random
[1:02:39] maybe tonight you've heard a bunch of
[1:02:41] lies about the ministers in this church
[1:02:43] maybe tonight that's what's keeping you
[1:02:46] from getting in the art because you
[1:02:47] don't like the way that the gospel has
[1:02:49] been presented they I'm sure it was the
[1:02:52] same way in Noah's day that they got so
[1:02:54] upset at the way maybe the way that
[1:02:55] Noah's hair was matted or the way that
[1:02:57] his hairstyle was or the way that he
[1:02:59] wore his clothes or something was off
[1:03:01] put into them and they ignored his
[1:03:03] message ignored the gospel and said I
[1:03:05] won't get in the ark because I don't
[1:03:07] want to be subject to that man I don't
[1:03:09] want to listen to him it's the same way
[1:03:11] today people look at the flesh instead
[1:03:13] of listening to the gospel
[1:03:15] people today say well what a weird group
[1:03:17] up there that believe you have to
[1:03:18] believe a man to be saved
[1:03:20] what a weird group to believe that you
[1:03:22] got to believe a man and meanwhile the
[1:03:25] whole rest of the world is believing
[1:03:26] their men the presbyterian's got a man
[1:03:29] sitting over their denomination and
[1:03:30] they're believing what he says the
[1:03:32] Catholics believe their Pope the
[1:03:34] methodists believe their God everybody's
[1:03:36] got a God that they listen to the
[1:03:38] Democrats have their guy and the
[1:03:40] Republicans have their God and the
[1:03:41] Libertarians have that guy and
[1:03:43] everybody's listening to their guy and
[1:03:45] then they're pointing at us and saying
[1:03:46] well you're listening to the word of
[1:03:48] Truth so I don't want to believe it and
[1:03:50] failing to enter the ark or if we could
[1:03:52] just lay down our pride and lay down our
[1:03:55] egos and just listen if we could just
[1:03:56] open up our ears and listen to the truth
[1:03:58] we'd climb up into that Ark gladly
[1:04:02] because you're going to have to the only
[1:04:04] way to go in this Rapture is to get in
[1:04:07] is to get in the ark the Ark of this
[1:04:09] message
[1:04:10] you are not going in the Rapture if you
[1:04:13] don't get into this message this message
[1:04:15] is the only way that you're going in the
[1:04:18] Rapture it's the only way out of here
[1:04:20] it's the only ticket to that other world
[1:04:22] like that Noah's message was the only
[1:04:25] ticket in his day to that other world
[1:04:27] where the ark took them you believe
[1:04:29] nowhere you did get on the ark you
[1:04:32] either believe no or you don't get on
[1:04:33] and when the door was shut by God it was
[1:04:36] too late
[1:04:38] you think about who would want to be
[1:04:41] outside of the Ark when the rains Begin
[1:04:42] to Fall when the water began to rise and
[1:04:45] the people began to realize that I
[1:04:47] should have I should have just ignored
[1:04:49] my superstition about Noah I should have
[1:04:52] ignored all my my ego I should have
[1:04:54] ignored all that and just got on that
[1:04:55] organ then I would have been safe now
[1:04:57] who would want to be here when the bombs
[1:05:00] Begin to Fall you see why we preached so
[1:05:02] hard we preach so hard because we don't
[1:05:05] want we don't want to see anybody here
[1:05:07] when the bonds Begin to Fall oh have you
[1:05:09] ever read those stories about the when
[1:05:11] the bombs fell in Japan what happened
[1:05:12] there was this group of people that the
[1:05:14] bombs fell and their faces were actually
[1:05:15] melted off until they had no eyes left
[1:05:18] all they had was a gaping hole in their
[1:05:20] face with their mouth began to open and
[1:05:22] open and they went around their skin
[1:05:23] melted them we went around it like like
[1:05:25] crabs through the street and people saw
[1:05:28] horrible sights when the bombs fell and
[1:05:30] you think you think this when the bombs
[1:05:32] fail fall when Russia begins to bomb and
[1:05:34] the bombs fall all around the world the
[1:05:36] world that it's going to be any
[1:05:37] different that that little peanut peanut
[1:05:40] situation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki oh
[1:05:43] if you're if you're sitting here tonight
[1:05:44] I
[1:05:45] I'm gonna go ahead and do like a good
[1:05:47] Baptist and hang you over hell because
[1:05:49] listen it's time to get scared it's time
[1:05:51] to do something do something don't you
[1:05:54] don't want to go through the things that
[1:05:56] are coming on the face of the Earth and
[1:05:57] you think about in Noah's day how it was
[1:06:00] easier to get animals onto that Ark than
[1:06:02] it was to get people
[1:06:03] he preached and he preached and he
[1:06:05] preached and all God's spirit had to do
[1:06:07] was move upon the people move upon the
[1:06:10] animals and here come the giraffe said
[1:06:12] Here Come the elephants and the clean
[1:06:13] animals seven by cinnamon and the
[1:06:15] unclean two by two and they marched they
[1:06:18] marched cleanly and nicely and orderly
[1:06:20] right up there because God's spirit told
[1:06:23] them what to do but you see God's spirit
[1:06:25] moving in a congregation and peoples
[1:06:27] with their hard hearts and they won't
[1:06:29] listen and they get all upset at the
[1:06:30] preachers and they get all upset and all
[1:06:32] their little pity Patty ideas and they
[1:06:34] won't move you see it's the same way
[1:06:36] today as it was back then where it's
[1:06:38] easier it's easier to get an animal to
[1:06:40] move away from the wall when a tornado's
[1:06:42] coming or when I heard Frankie's coming
[1:06:44] it would move easier to get cows to move
[1:06:46] out in the middle of a field Lee under
[1:06:49] the leading of the Holy Spirit and they
[1:06:50] get people to come into the ark but if
[1:06:53] they wanted to get in that art they had
[1:06:54] to come by Noah's message the only way
[1:06:56] to get in the door was to believe what
[1:06:58] that man preached
[1:07:01] you see I can't help there's a lot of
[1:07:03] things I can't there's a lot of things
[1:07:04] no one couldn't help
[1:07:05] no one couldn't help all the scarecrows
[1:07:08] Noah couldn't help today we can't help I
[1:07:10] can't help all the websites I can't help
[1:07:12] all the critics and I can't help all the
[1:07:14] weird carnal stuff that's been done
[1:07:16] under the guise of this message
[1:07:18] there's been a lot of weird stuff
[1:07:21] there's been a lot of weird things a lot
[1:07:22] of weird things that preachers have said
[1:07:24] behind the pulpas and I can't help that
[1:07:25] I can't help all those things I can't
[1:07:28] help people that ain't living right now
[1:07:29] I can't help the Hypocrites I can't help
[1:07:31] the anointing ones in this age I can't
[1:07:33] help the things that are leading people
[1:07:34] astray I can't help preachers that
[1:07:36] misrepresent the gospel but that was a
[1:07:38] lot that no one couldn't help either but
[1:07:39] it was the truth anyhow he preached the
[1:07:42] truth despite all the things that the
[1:07:43] devil threw as obstacles in the people's
[1:07:45] way to get them to get them to disbelief
[1:07:48] and I no one couldn't help but his day
[1:07:50] and we can't help today but we're going
[1:07:52] to preach the truth anyhow
[1:07:54] to think that God foreknew how many
[1:07:57] people would get on that Ark and how
[1:08:00] many ghosts and how many sheep and how
[1:08:02] many elephants and how many well maybe
[1:08:04] there was dinosaurs how many dinosaurs
[1:08:06] would get on the ark maybe little ones
[1:08:07] maybe I don't know how many but God knew
[1:08:10] how many would get on that Ark he knew
[1:08:12] the number of humans that were going to
[1:08:14] believe that word and they were ordained
[1:08:16] to be Believers and the generation that
[1:08:18] they were living in and God knows
[1:08:20] sitting here tonight if you're going to
[1:08:22] get in that Ark listening in on the
[1:08:23] Airways tonight maybe sitting at home in
[1:08:25] your living room listening in God knows
[1:08:27] if you're going to get in that Ark if
[1:08:28] you've been ordained to receive it in
[1:08:30] the age that you're living in you're
[1:08:31] going to believe it despite all the
[1:08:33] scarecrows despite all the intellectuals
[1:08:35] despite all the educated despite all the
[1:08:38] naysayers despite everything because it
[1:08:40] makes no difference to a Believer
[1:08:42] because a Believer is a paradox themself
[1:08:45] and a Believer is going to believe no
[1:08:47] matter what the devil throws at it a
[1:08:50] Believer believes that God is a god of
[1:08:51] paradoxes a Believer believes like
[1:08:54] brother Andrew Glover said one time a
[1:08:55] Believer believes in the bad times the
[1:08:57] believer believes in the good times it
[1:08:58] don't matter because that's that's what
[1:09:00] a Believer does a Believer believes this
[1:09:03] message is the word and the word is
[1:09:04] everything you need to get into the ark
[1:09:10] if you want a way of Escape
[1:09:12] into the word of the age that you're
[1:09:14] living in
[1:09:15] amen Noah preached the word
[1:09:18] all Noah had was the word
[1:09:21] all no one needed was the word
[1:09:23] and there is where Noah's power was
[1:09:26] and there's where your power is
[1:09:29] the power to know that you if you look
[1:09:31] in that God's word and it says you can
[1:09:33] have it that you got the right motive
[1:09:35] you get the right motive you've got the
[1:09:37] right reason you got the will of God
[1:09:39] that you speak the word and something's
[1:09:43] going to happen
[1:09:44] speak that word oh you see what God has
[1:09:47] built us up in by this word that's been
[1:09:49] opened up to us precept upon precept
[1:09:51] here to there a little built us up to a
[1:09:54] place where you should be at a place to
[1:09:56] speak that word if you have a need in
[1:09:58] your life speak it if you have a need in
[1:10:00] your life this afternoon don't leave
[1:10:02] without receiving what you have neither
[1:10:04] but speak it speak and say God I confess
[1:10:07] that whatever you said I I claim it
[1:10:09] right now I claim my healing I claim I
[1:10:12] claim Deliverance I claim salvation I
[1:10:14] claim my children you speak that word
[1:10:16] and you've got the right motive you've
[1:10:18] got the right reason you've got the
[1:10:19] right will something is bound to happen
[1:10:22] why because a paradox is speaking
[1:10:24] speaking a miracle you're speaking what
[1:10:27] God is already saying it's a paradox
[1:10:29] when God goes to working
[1:10:32] that's what a paradox is as a miracle
[1:10:34] working God moving
[1:10:36] it was a paradox when Israel stood on
[1:10:38] one side of the hill on the Goliath on
[1:10:39] the other side
[1:10:40] it was a paradox when David took God at
[1:10:42] his word and went defeated Goliath it
[1:10:44] was a paradox when David killed Goliath
[1:10:46] with a little sling
[1:10:51] because where the word is
[1:10:53] where the word is the spirit is and
[1:10:56] that's where Miracles are going to
[1:10:57] happen
[1:10:59] Revelation is a paradox
[1:11:02] oh you think about what a parrot what a
[1:11:04] paradox it is to look by faith and
[1:11:06] ignore all the situation that you're
[1:11:08] looking at it's a paradox that a holy
[1:11:10] ghost can open your eyes and you can
[1:11:12] read the scriptures that have blinded
[1:11:14] others but you can see it clearly it's a
[1:11:16] paradox that you can see what others can
[1:11:18] it's a it was a paradox that Paul could
[1:11:21] see that light but others couldn't
[1:11:22] it was a paradox that Peter knew who he
[1:11:25] was when others didn't
[1:11:27] when Jesus went around that campfire and
[1:11:29] began to ask him who do you say that I
[1:11:30] the son of man well I am and and
[1:11:32] everybody was like well this one and
[1:11:34] this one and that one but Peter knew who
[1:11:36] he was
[1:11:37] a holy ghost didn't work as a paradox
[1:11:40] and life is a paradox
[1:11:43] when that little baby was born to marry
[1:11:45] it was a paradox that God could speak
[1:11:48] life into a mother's womb and she'd be a
[1:11:50] virgin it was Joseph couldn't explain
[1:11:52] that Mary couldn't explain it science
[1:11:54] couldn't explain it but it happened
[1:11:56] anyway
[1:11:57] it was a paradox when he gave his life
[1:11:59] there on the cross and he gave his life
[1:12:01] so that he could give his life to us and
[1:12:04] that's the greatest Paradox and when God
[1:12:07] gave his life you know you can't
[1:12:08] separate a man from his life
[1:12:11] if you've got the life of God there
[1:12:12] ain't no separating that
[1:12:14] in Romans chapter 8 it says who shall
[1:12:16] separate us from the love of Christ
[1:12:17] shall tribulation or distress or
[1:12:19] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[1:12:21] Peril or sword nothing can separate you
[1:12:24] from that life and that life of God is a
[1:12:26] paradox it's a miracle that God could
[1:12:29] put his life in you and live in you and
[1:12:32] walk in you and talking you it's a
[1:12:34] paradox that a man or a woman could
[1:12:37] yield themselves so much till God could
[1:12:39] take over could take them over
[1:12:42] brother room said we Pentecostals we're
[1:12:44] taking God too commonly
[1:12:47] the whole thing we just let it pass by
[1:12:50] don't do that
[1:12:52] he said listen right now in our midst
[1:12:55] Jesus Christ is here
[1:12:58] that's a paradox how that he's alive
[1:13:00] after 2 000 years
[1:13:03] who can explain that
[1:13:05] how the he that Spirit unseen can come
[1:13:07] among us and take an individual and
[1:13:10] identify himself exactly impersonate
[1:13:13] himself in an individual as you as a
[1:13:17] believer
[1:13:18] and to a gift
[1:13:20] that's a paradox
[1:13:22] you are a paradox
[1:13:24] and a paradox don't have any trouble
[1:13:26] believing in a paradox
[1:13:27] a paradox a miracle don't have any
[1:13:30] trouble believing in a miracle you are a
[1:13:32] miracle tonight as a musicians come
[1:13:34] you can believe for the impossible
[1:13:37] you can believe for healing you can
[1:13:39] believe for a body change despite what
[1:13:42] science says when the doctor tells you
[1:13:44] it ain't possible like they told like
[1:13:46] science told them in Noah's day it ain't
[1:13:49] possible for rain to fall
[1:13:51] you can believe in a miracle
[1:13:54] it's a miracle when God brings life
[1:13:57] so this afternoon as we stand to our
[1:13:59] feet I've got news for John McArthur the
[1:14:01] days of Miracle are not passed
[1:14:04] the days of Miracles are still here
[1:14:06] if his presence is here what does it
[1:14:08] matter what comes our way the days are
[1:14:10] Miracles are still here
[1:14:13] he is still Jehovah Jireh
[1:14:18] yeah go ahead
[1:14:31] so I was getting I called the doctor and
[1:14:33] he couldn't bring one up and I was
[1:14:35] getting ready and so I sat down on the
[1:14:38] couch I got it got his pass and all that
[1:14:40] okay
[1:14:47] on the couch and I was putting shoes on
[1:14:51] So Lisa coming I tried to get him up I
[1:14:54] could not get him up at least he tried
[1:14:56] to come and help me she probably
[1:14:58] tried but we couldn't get him out of the
[1:15:00] floor because he would say he wasn't
[1:15:01] even
[1:15:04] so she said I'm calling paramedics and I
[1:15:06] said okay so they were coming and she
[1:15:10] went outside to tell them you know this
[1:15:12] is right place and I just looked over
[1:15:15] him and I said
[1:15:18] I don't know why I said that because
[1:15:20] I've used patents was coming but I
[1:15:22] looked down at him and I said honey we
[1:15:24] gotta get you up
[1:15:27] honestly
[1:15:30] come to myself
[1:15:32] he was sitting on the bed and I was
[1:15:34] standing inside
[1:15:36] amen
[1:15:46] amen
[1:15:51] now see right there what that ought to
[1:15:53] do to all of our faith is it elevated
[1:15:55] or if God can do that for them he can do
[1:15:58] it for you if some are receiving a
[1:15:59] blessing you can receive a blessing or
[1:16:02] whatever you have in need of God is a
[1:16:03] miracle working God
[1:16:05] you think you think about when brother
[1:16:07] Branham was telling well he was sitting
[1:16:09] there and Hattie Rice home and he was
[1:16:10] telling about how that God is still
[1:16:12] Jehovah Jireh that he's still their God
[1:16:14] that same God that was able to speak a
[1:16:17] lamb and put a lamb next there for
[1:16:19] Abraham that same God was able to speak
[1:16:21] those squirrel to put those squirrels
[1:16:23] where brother Brown spoke them into
[1:16:24] existence and Hattie Wright said over
[1:16:27] there she said that ain't nothing but
[1:16:28] the truth and brother Brown said that a
[1:16:30] greater he said a super anointing came
[1:16:33] in there I mean I'll say it like this a
[1:16:35] great when she said that a greater
[1:16:36] anointing came in that room then when
[1:16:38] brother Brown spoke those squirrels to
[1:16:40] begin with all because she said that
[1:16:42] ain't nothing but the truth if you can
[1:16:44] believe it if you can believe it you
[1:16:46] have a paradox and didn't know how to
[1:16:48] write get a paradox there when she said
[1:16:50] ain't nothing but the truth she spoke
[1:16:51] she spoke salvation and her little
[1:16:53] little boy's lives and she got it oh
[1:16:56] yeah well I think sometimes we do we
[1:16:58] just don't realize what we got access to
[1:17:00] and all because God graced us with this
[1:17:03] message oh we got something worth more
[1:17:05] than silver and gold something worth
[1:17:08] more than all this natural life worth
[1:17:10] more than anything this world holds that
[1:17:13] to know that the days of Miracles are
[1:17:15] still with us because the god of
[1:17:16] Miracles is with us let's sing a song
[1:17:19] and worship Him Blessed Assurance this

[1:24:05] together so it's always good I told him
[1:24:07] Sunday afternoon there were more people
[1:24:09] watching online than it was in the
[1:24:11] building so that's how many of y'all
[1:24:13] were gone
[1:24:14] but and sick so we're glad to have all
[1:24:17] the sick ones back and we're glad to
[1:24:19] have all the ones that travel back but
[1:24:20] we appreciate brother Bob we appreciate
[1:24:22] the stand yeah it's a listen if you're a
[1:24:24] Christian it's a paradox period
[1:24:26] everything you do is a paradigm
[1:24:28] because you just don't think like the
[1:24:29] world is what we've been trying to say
[1:24:30] it's just a paradox you just don't think
[1:24:32] like the world
[1:24:33] and you don't do like the world and the
[1:24:36] world looks at you and thinks you're
[1:24:37] crazy
[1:24:38] they probably looked at Noah for 120
[1:24:40] years
[1:24:41] we think 60 years since the prophet left
[1:24:43] they've been looking at us to bride and
[1:24:45] people are now they're going high and
[1:24:48] they did the same thing when Noah
[1:24:49] probably at first they thought yeah Noah
[1:24:50] something different
[1:24:53] rain we gonna have rain we're going to
[1:24:55] help you build this boat
[1:24:58] no
[1:24:59] no
[1:25:01] Noah only Built that art big enough for
[1:25:03] eight people
[1:25:05] God knew there'd only be eight or he
[1:25:07] would have had to build 50 000 boats
[1:25:09] because there were seven million billion
[1:25:11] people in the world at that time but he
[1:25:13] knew there was only a certain group of
[1:25:14] people just like us as a certain group
[1:25:16] of people going to make it and we just
[1:25:19] pray that we're the ones we we we're
[1:25:21] just going to do the things that God
[1:25:22] tell us to do we're going to our
[1:25:24] greatest gift of this whole season is
[1:25:26] that we'll do what the word of God says
[1:25:28] amen and it will do exactly what we've
[1:25:31] been taught and and man you know you
[1:25:34] things that you think sometimes it's
[1:25:35] repetition I was thinking the other day
[1:25:37] repetition repetition but you know what
[1:25:39] repetition as human beings you do things
[1:25:42] you know I mean people are not going to
[1:25:44] just go out there and play football
[1:25:46] they're going to practice so we've been
[1:25:48] practicing for 50 or 60 years some some
[1:25:50] of us and and I think it's about time to
[1:25:53] play the big game
[1:25:55] it's about time to get out of here it's
[1:25:57] about time
[1:26:00] and live it and and that's the greatest
[1:26:02] gift God came to give us a gift now
[1:26:05] we're going to give one back to him by
[1:26:06] living what he said but thank God for
[1:26:08] all of you we appreciate you like saying
[1:26:10] only one service Sunday then we'll go to
[1:26:12] Hidden Acres and we'll have a catered
[1:26:15] dinner down there and then we'll have uh
[1:26:18] gift giving after that and I think we've
[1:26:20] got it till about five o'clock so we'll
[1:26:22] just have a time of fellowship and I
[1:26:24] think there's going to be a few singings
[1:26:26] or something Sunday so we'll have a
[1:26:28] little bit longer service maybe I don't
[1:26:30] think we're going to eat till one
[1:26:31] o'clock Lisa when are they coming
[1:26:34] 12 30. they're coming at 12 30.
[1:26:39] well we'll do the best we can okay
[1:26:41] because we got about three programs that
[1:26:44] they're they're going to do so uh so
[1:26:46] we'll uh do the best we can but we'll
[1:26:48] we'll get there plenty of time so love
[1:26:50] you with the love of the Lord and go
[1:26:52] with God on the way home be safe
[1:26:55] and remember one thing
[1:26:57] you are a paradox
[1:27:00] you're and that's what God wants so
[1:27:02] that's what we're going to be we're
[1:27:03] going to be the will of God we're going
[1:27:04] to beat the Paradox and we're going to
[1:27:06] be different
[1:27:07] we're gonna think different we're gonna
[1:27:09] act different amen so let's bow our
[1:27:11] heads Lord thank you for this evening
[1:27:12] you give us thank you for brother Bob
[1:27:14] Lord just pouring out his heart
[1:27:17] and I pray Lord that you would help him

[1:27:27] that you'll give him Supernatural
[1:27:29] strength give each one of us Lord's

[1:27:45] this should be with each one be with the
[1:27:47] ones that are still sick be with the
[1:27:49] ones Lord that still have the fever and
[1:27:50] different things and and coughs and
