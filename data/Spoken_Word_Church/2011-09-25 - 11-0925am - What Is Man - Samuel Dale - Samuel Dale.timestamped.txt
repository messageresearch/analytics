[18:54] the point of what we're doing then we
[18:56] want to go over to job 15 and pick up a
[19:00] couple more verses all
[19:02] right therefore I will not refrain my
[19:05] mouth I will speak in the anguish of my
[19:09] spirit I will complain in the bitterness
[19:12] of my
[19:13] soul am I a sea or a whale that thou set
[19:17] us to watch over
[19:19] me when I say my bed shall comfort me my
[19:24] couch shall ease my
[19:26] complaint then thy scarth me with dreams
[19:29] and terrifies me through w v Visions so
[19:34] that my soul
[19:36] chooses strangling and death rather than
[19:40] my life I lo it I would not live
[19:45] always let me alone for my days are
[19:48] vanity what is man that thou should us
[19:52] Magnify Him and that thou should us set
[19:56] thine heart upon him
[19:58] let's go on down to read the next one
[20:00] and that thou should us visit him every
[20:03] morning and try him every moment go over
[20:07] now to the
[20:09] 15th I just want to pick up something a
[20:11] little thought here from our scriptures
[20:15] today and try to carry on what we've
[20:17] been dealing with so we'll go to the
[20:19] 15th chapter verse
[20:23] 14 what is man that thou should us that
[20:26] he should be clean
[20:29] and he which is born of a woman that he
[20:31] should be righteous behold he putteth no
[20:35] trust in his sa yay the heavens are not
[20:37] clean in his sight how much more
[20:40] abominable and filthy is man which
[20:42] drinketh
[20:44] iniquity like
[20:47] water let's just stop right there you
[20:51] may be seated the Lord have his Blessing
[20:52] to the reading of the word now job we
[20:56] know is one of the listed as one of the
[21:01] great wisdom men of the of the Bible and
[21:05] uh great understanding and if you read
[21:09] he's in a turmoil and you know in these
[21:12] things and his buddies comes to try to
[21:15] condemn him for thinking that you know
[21:18] he at one time he had all kind of
[21:21] animals he had all kind of of uh doings
[21:24] he had uh seven kids I think it was and
[21:27] God took all of them from him and left
[21:30] him sitting on an ash Heap you know out
[21:34] cuz that was the way they would set back
[21:35] then when things would go wrong and had
[21:37] balls you know risings all over him and
[21:41] and things like that and it looked like
[21:42] that he had uh you know done something
[21:46] wrong but he's putting forth his answer
[21:49] back to these that condemn him and and
[21:53] he's telling them about what is man now
[21:57] that's what I want you to think about
[21:58] today because we've been in our studies
[22:01] now we we've come through for quite a
[22:03] while speaking about heaven and then
[22:06] coming down to earth and and picking up
[22:09] the creation of the earth and and
[22:11] bringing it forth to see how that it God
[22:14] in his wonderful Beauty made such a
[22:16] beautiful place and and everything for
[22:19] us to live on and then coming on down to
[22:22] sin and what was the original sin as we
[22:26] covered in in our life message and we
[22:29] know that the original sin was to
[22:31] disbelieve God's word all right anytime
[22:34] you doubt God's word as being true cuz
[22:37] that's what he said to Eve now we can go
[22:40] into the uh thing and we know and
[22:42] believe what happened in the garden but
[22:45] that was a
[22:46] manifestation of the unbelief that she
[22:48] had within her heart because she
[22:51] disbelieve God when God said you can eat
[22:53] of all of the fruit of the of the trees
[22:55] and everything but said just leave the
[22:57] one in the M of The Garden Alone well
[23:00] that wasn't no apple tree or a p or a
[23:02] peach or some kind of a tree that was
[23:05] there because it was an oddl looking
[23:08] tree if you look at it because it was
[23:10] said the Bible said it was a tree of
[23:12] knowledge of Good and Evil that's right
[23:14] so it would have to be something other
[23:15] than a natural apple tree but we covered
[23:19] those things but the main thing I wanted
[23:21] you to see is that she disbelieved God's
[23:24] word when he said you eat thereof that
[23:28] day you die right all right she
[23:31] disbelieved God's word she doubted God
[23:34] keeping his
[23:35] word all right so that would be the
[23:38] original sin now the
[23:40] attribute see that's what I've tried to
[23:43] bring to you that the attributes see was
[23:46] what was
[23:47] displayed but she originally disbelieved
[23:50] inside of her and then she displayed the
[23:53] the rest with her life but her unbelief
[23:56] is the the m thing and that's our
[23:59] problem today because that's you know
[24:03] that's where we
[24:05] stand we have a right today to believe
[24:08] what God says or doubt what he says and
[24:11] if we doubt what he says because of any
[24:13] reason or any thought whatsoever then
[24:16] that would make us an unbeliever just
[24:19] like it was in the original then we'll
[24:22] go out and do things that are wrong
[24:24] because we're an unbeliever that's
[24:26] that's the display we look at down and
[24:28] and seeing what happened in the garden
[24:30] and we can say well it was this and some
[24:32] says it was this and some says it was
[24:34] that but you know my main point of what
[24:37] I'm getting at is unbelief right to
[24:41] disbelieve God's word right now when God
[24:44] says that by Stripes I'm Healed that's
[24:47] right I must say what he says that's
[24:50] right all right because if I don't say
[24:53] what he says how can he ever heal me so
[24:56] I must take his word and just stay on
[24:58] that irregardless of what anything takes
[25:01] place and then just say what he says
[25:03] because not see then I'm doubting what
[25:05] he
[25:06] says so is it with salvation if you need
[25:09] salvation then take God at his
[25:12] word he ask him to save you and then
[25:15] take him at his word and say thank you
[25:18] Lord for saving me right all right then
[25:21] the rest of it God will take care of if
[25:24] we believe him and Keep On Believing him
[25:27] but our problem is we believe today and
[25:29] then some little something goes wrong
[25:31] and you know it's just like being
[25:34] sick we we say well well thank you Lord
[25:37] for healing me all right we feel
[25:39] better maybe we feel better and start
[25:41] doing pretty good all right just in a
[25:43] little bit everything start going wrong
[25:45] but when it does then we start doubting
[25:48] whether or not we're healed and that's
[25:51] where the problem it so is it with
[25:53] salvation do you doubt whether or not
[25:55] God saved you then what he's he makes
[25:59] intercession the Bible says Upon Our
[26:02] confession all right so if we confess
[26:05] that we're healed we're healed we
[26:06] confess we're saved we're saved right
[26:09] all right now the difference in healing
[26:10] and salvation healing is on a a
[26:13] temporary basis which means you can be
[26:15] healed and then get sick again but in
[26:18] Salvation you you don't lose your
[26:20] salvation so what you do is you confess
[26:24] until God accepts your confession as
[26:27] being what you believe then he comes and
[26:29] gives you an answer back which is the
[26:32] new birth coming to live within us all
[26:35] right and we'll get more down to that
[26:36] later but I want to just deal with
[26:40] something because we've dropped down
[26:43] from the the the creation and things and
[26:46] I want to just deal with what is
[26:49] man and I just want you to think about
[26:52] yourself you know what is man that a
[26:55] great man like that see we generally
[26:57] want to run run over to
[26:58] Hebrews and and take up the Life part of
[27:01] what he was doing but remember now job
[27:04] is not the one that Paul is picking up
[27:07] in Hebrews he's picking up from the
[27:09] psalmist David when he's confessing and
[27:12] he's talking about and he said what is
[27:14] man the dark mindful of him and the son
[27:16] of man that thou visited him but here in
[27:18] job he just simply saying what is man he
[27:22] said am I seea or am I whale or you know
[27:25] what am
[27:26] I
[27:28] what's the difference in me and a
[27:30] dog you know what's the difference in a
[27:33] human being and a dog you know well we
[27:37] walk upright and they cry well sometimes
[27:38] look like they're pretty smart too but
[27:41] yeah that's what I want to get to what
[27:43] is
[27:44] man I wanted just to just to talk about
[27:48] it and then you'll easily see if you
[27:52] watch what I'm getting at you'll easily
[27:54] see what the fall of Man is and you'll
[27:57] easily see then what uh what I was
[28:00] saying a moment
[28:02] ago that we must confess right we must
[28:06] believe we must
[28:09] confess and we must keep our
[28:12] confession God if we doubt our own
[28:14] confession what what's any need saying
[28:16] it that's right you know I mean what's
[28:19] any need in talking about anything if
[28:21] we're not going to believe what we say
[28:22] that's right that's right and and and
[28:25] you know we as human mortal we want to
[28:28] be to the basis of of taking somebody's
[28:31] word sometimes that may be hard to do
[28:34] but yet still you know we should take
[28:37] one another's
[28:38] Worden well that's where I've been told
[28:41] said but you you you got a problem
[28:43] because you believe what people say I
[28:45] believe what people say until it's
[28:46] proved
[28:47] wrong what's wrong with
[28:50] that you know I mean I can go say what
[28:52] you you say you're not
[28:55] guilty of committing a crime well I say
[28:57] Well they're not guilty well then the
[28:59] court says they are guilty
[29:02] well that's their business I'm just
[29:04] saying what you told me see I want to
[29:07] confess what God says right you
[29:10] understand cuz in that way then I can
[29:11] depend upon him to keep his word why
[29:15] because he's going to come back to my
[29:16] word right see that's why in U what is
[29:20] it
[29:21] Romans with a heart you believe mouth
[29:24] you confess all right but now
[29:30] I want us to look just simply at man we
[29:33] talked about in our last message of how
[29:37] that you got a deal there or a part in
[29:40] Genesis that you got a part in Genesis
[29:43] 126 and 27 where it talks about you know
[29:47] that God created man in his own image
[29:50] all right now then you go over to
[29:52] Genesis 2:7 and he creates the natural
[29:56] man well God made a spiritual man
[30:00] Adam in his own image all right which
[30:04] was a spirit
[30:05] man okay but then Genesis 2 he made the
[30:09] natural man and that's where the
[30:12] confusion with mankind is they'll read
[30:14] it and they wonder which way was what oh
[30:16] it's very simple one was the spiritual
[30:18] man the other one was the natural man
[30:21] the spiritual man was to rule over the
[30:23] animals and the things as God ruled the
[30:26] natural man then was put into the garden
[30:29] to till the soil to to uh to do the
[30:31] things you know and not from the sweat
[30:34] of his brow but because of of uh you
[30:37] know doing what he wanted to do I don't
[30:40] believe Adam had to get out there every
[30:42] day and dig ditches and you know and
[30:44] plow the mules and things he didn't it
[30:47] wasn't that way but he was put there to
[30:50] to be over the garden right all right if
[30:52] he wanted the tree moved all he had to
[30:54] do was say move right he didn't have to
[30:57] dig it up and replant it right you know
[30:59] he could just say move because why he
[31:01] was in the image of God all right but
[31:03] now we saw that the fall of
[31:06] Man you know when the fall came it put
[31:10] all
[31:12] mankind into a condition or an existence
[31:16] that made us all
[31:19] lost all right the psalmist David said
[31:22] we were born in sin sh in iniquity a
[31:24] spoused my mother's wound and and went
[31:27] forth Liars that's putting like three
[31:29] scriptures together all right see then
[31:35] man he he's a wonderful thing he's made
[31:39] the highest form the lastest one that
[31:41] was
[31:42] made all right God made all the animals
[31:45] and made things then he made man all
[31:48] right and he put him here for a special
[31:51] purpose that even you see that purpose
[31:54] and that idea in mind as you see him
[31:57] that he's in the image of God Amen that
[32:01] the animals they build their nest the
[32:03] same way they do everything the same as
[32:06] they used to 2,000 years a bird still
[32:09] builds his nest you know now you can
[32:12] stand out there all you want to and tell
[32:14] him he don't need to do that he he's not
[32:17] going to listen to you you know he's
[32:19] going to go on and build that nest and
[32:22] he's going to do everything the same now
[32:24] there's certain ways you can train
[32:27] animals to a
[32:28] degree to get them you know in a
[32:31] different way but that's what I want you
[32:34] to look at what's the difference in us
[32:36] and an
[32:38] animal all right because that animal as
[32:42] I said he can be trained to a certain
[32:45] degree but that's as far as he can be
[32:48] trained now naturally they've got
[32:50] animals now that can
[32:52] talk you know you ever heard a dog talk
[32:55] I have we used to hunt with a guy and
[32:58] and he he had trained a dog and the dog
[32:59] was little old uh Chihuahua and he'd say
[33:03] booger booger you know and you can
[33:06] understand it they've got dogs that can
[33:08] say words enough to do but it's because
[33:11] of what they've been constantly
[33:14] trained all right now in doing those
[33:18] things then see we are the highest form
[33:22] that was created and we only look at the
[33:26] spiritual creation of
[33:28] man as to try to get it into the image
[33:30] of God but I want you to look at the
[33:33] natural part of
[33:35] you as I said what is it that makes you
[33:38] so
[33:40] different what is it that makes us
[33:42] different from the animals that even in
[33:45] the fall in state of
[33:50] man look at the
[33:52] animals they're still under our
[33:54] domain we can take as I said and train
[33:57] things train animals to do
[34:00] things cuz it's repetitive repetitive
[34:03] repetitive until it finally will start
[34:06] doing those things but you know in doing
[34:10] it that animal can't reason out anything
[34:14] that's right that's
[34:16] right I've always said if a if a
[34:20] turkey could smell like a deer you know
[34:23] the ability nobody to ever kill a turkey
[34:26] that's right
[34:27] well because their eyesight is so great
[34:29] and their hearing is so great until I
[34:32] mean you move a finger at 100 yards and
[34:34] they can see it all right but see God
[34:38] made each one of them and he placed it
[34:40] into each animal to be what he is and
[34:43] you
[34:44] know but that animal still can't reason
[34:47] out things that's
[34:50] right so he's not in the image of
[34:54] God Even in our fallen estate that's
[34:57] what I want you to get to CU once we
[35:00] fail everybody failed it wouldn't just
[35:02] half of us fail amen you know a lot of
[35:04] people like to try to make two lineages
[35:06] and come down and try to make some kind
[35:08] of a beast lineage and a human lineage
[35:10] and all and don't worry about it we'll
[35:12] get to it more this afternoon then once
[35:15] you come on over to the time of the
[35:16] flood you can't separate none of the
[35:18] lineages whatsoever so you might as well
[35:21] just leave it alone but my point this
[35:23] morning is one thing
[35:28] God made a
[35:30] man the highest form of
[35:33] animal cuz that's what we are right
[35:37] we're the highest form of animal that
[35:40] exist right but the difference between
[35:43] us and an
[35:44] animal you
[35:46] know Birds deer dogs cats whatever
[35:51] monkeys I know they're close and I agree
[35:54] that sometimes we act like monkeys
[35:56] ourselves
[35:57] but that still doesn't make us one and
[36:01] but in all of
[36:03] that man was placed and made here for a
[36:07] specific purpose amen you look at
[36:13] him he can think things out that's his
[36:17] problem he can reason it out right that
[36:20] can be wonderful but it also can be
[36:24] damaging because he was given that
[36:28] ability and even though in his Fallen
[36:33] estate Even in our lost
[36:37] estate we have great
[36:40] abilities there's people that can
[36:42] actually take and and B
[36:47] metal this is not
[36:49] jokes Bend metal break glass Etc with
[36:54] from a a part of you
[36:58] that's called a
[37:01] soul it's almost to the day now that
[37:04] we're living they have soldiers today
[37:08] that can run almost full out for almost
[37:11] 24
[37:12] hours Elite forces that is can do almost
[37:17] impossible
[37:19] things controlled their body so
[37:24] much until it it it's a amazing because
[37:28] they've learned to do that they've built
[37:31] that up over a period of time like a uh
[37:34] uh we shoot guns a lot and and I teach
[37:37] the kids to always did coming down and
[37:40] and try to with anybody that shoots you
[37:42] know when you're shooting a gun you
[37:45] don't want to be breathing while you're
[37:46] shooting because it's going to throw you
[37:48] off just a hire but you'll miss your
[37:50] target so what you do is you take a deep
[37:54] breath or either you blow out either way
[37:57] you want to do it but then you hold
[38:00] yourself all right there's people now
[38:02] that are called
[38:03] Sharpshooters that can actually control
[38:06] their own heart
[38:08] rate now I'm just getting the point of
[38:10] man all right just listen they can
[38:14] control their heart rate because even a
[38:17] heartbeat shooting a th000
[38:20] yards and your heartbeat being
[38:24] fast it can throw you off enough to you
[38:26] just a high is all it
[38:29] takes and you'll almost miss the
[38:32] target th000 yards away but there's
[38:35] people that can shoot that way there's
[38:37] people that can shoot for
[38:39] Miles because they've learned to control
[38:42] theirselves all right now if we could do
[38:46] that in the
[38:47] natural how much would it be if we can
[38:49] get into the spiritual with God to be
[38:51] able to do those things is my point that
[38:53] we'll get back to but I want you to
[38:55] think about it
[38:57] see no matter what you
[38:59] are you're a Son of God right by your
[39:03] natural creation right now you notice
[39:06] the way I said it natural
[39:09] creation you're actually a creation of
[39:11] God who created us the devil certainly
[39:14] can't create right people say the devil
[39:17] made me do this let's don't blame the
[39:19] devil for everything right all right we
[39:22] got to volunteer that's what I was
[39:24] getting out about Eve to start with hey
[39:26] she not volunteered to listen to the
[39:29] devil through that
[39:31] serpy then it wouldn't have been any
[39:33] problem but that's what I want you to
[39:35] get at
[39:37] is think about you and what you
[39:42] are and I believe this will help us to
[39:45] understand salvation and the way that it
[39:49] works upon us and what is happening in
[39:52] life cuz that's my point not to just
[39:55] preach a message about people and what
[39:57] they
[39:58] are but we're the highest form of
[40:03] animal you take a a a a bar and you skin
[40:07] it down and you lay a child down beside
[40:09] of it and they look almost
[40:12] identical take the skin off the bar you
[40:15] know thing why because we're just a
[40:17] higher form of
[40:18] animal but yet God chose to make us that
[40:23] way and he placed within us
[40:29] a
[40:30] soul now what is a
[40:33] soul the word soul is interchangeable
[40:35] with
[40:38] Spirit you can use the word Spirit Soul
[40:40] interchangeably coming through the
[40:43] Bible but you get over like David as
[40:46] we'll get to it in a minute he said my
[40:49] soul thirth after to thee Oh
[40:52] God see there's something about Mankind
[40:55] and the way he's made
[40:58] he's made
[41:00] to serve God right God wanted Fellowship
[41:05] amen he could fellowship with the
[41:07] animals that was fine he could come down
[41:09] every day and talk to the bar the the
[41:11] dogs the lines of things he could
[41:13] fellowship with but yet that wasn't what
[41:16] he
[41:18] wanted forgive
[41:20] me he wanted something in more closer to
[41:25] him to he create a
[41:29] man and that man then being more into
[41:34] his likeness he could have
[41:37] Fellowship right he could talk with
[41:40] him
[41:42] amen like a prophet said he came down in
[41:44] the cool of the day in the garden and he
[41:48] spoke to Adam and Eve fellowship with
[41:53] him forgive me they still can't figure
[41:56] figure out what I'm doing
[41:58] yet I've been to all kind of doctors to
[42:00] try to find out what this problem is but
[42:02] they can't find it out so I know what it
[42:04] is is Satan trying to cut off my voice
[42:06] that's all right I'll whisper if I have
[42:08] to but get this you don't call F me cuz
[42:11] I got enough trouble clearing my own
[42:12] throat all right but now think about
[42:16] it my point is to try to get you to
[42:18] think about
[42:21] yourself let's don't even talk about
[42:23] Salvation let's don't even talk about uh
[42:26] you know anything like that that can be
[42:28] dealt with we'll take that up in the
[42:30] next message or so let's just talk about
[42:32] you cuz I was just thinking about
[42:34] something you know what is
[42:40] man what is
[42:44] man that God would want to fellowship
[42:47] with
[42:49] us do we smell
[42:52] different do we look
[42:55] different why would he want to
[42:57] fellowship with
[42:59] us because he created us in that image
[43:03] that's right that
[43:06] likeness of
[43:09] himself and in doing that then he can
[43:11] come down and
[43:13] fellowship we'll get down to it later
[43:15] where he comes on down into human flesh
[43:16] in the Lord Jesus Christ but I'm trying
[43:18] to bring down something you we may be
[43:20] surprising this afternoon when we pick
[43:22] up and try to run through the Bible a
[43:23] little bit with with doing it but I'm
[43:25] trying to just bring a few points here
[43:28] to us because I asked a person one time
[43:31] I said uh what does your pastor preach
[43:34] about the soul and what a soul really is
[43:36] and she told me she
[43:38] said I don't I've never heard him preach
[43:41] on it well I thought well surely
[43:45] somewhere down the line I don't have a
[43:47] backlog of sermons rolled up to where
[43:49] that I can just pick one to preach
[43:51] surely somewhere down the line they
[43:53] ought have been talking about something
[43:55] of what is a s
[43:57] now you can get Webster's definition you
[44:00] can get the things and try to pick up
[44:01] you know to what what it is and what
[44:03] you're doing and all but man is a triun
[44:07] being that's right just like God is a
[44:10] triun being he's not a trinity he's a
[44:12] triun being Father Son and Holy Ghost
[44:15] one true and living God simple
[44:17] terminology right Father Son and Holy
[44:20] Ghost making one God all right see then
[44:23] when he made man he made us as a Body
[44:27] Spirit and
[44:29] soul to where he can communicate with us
[44:32] body we can communicate with with one
[44:34] another through our bodies we talk we
[44:37] you know you hear taste you see taste
[44:38] feel smell hear all of your your senses
[44:42] all right then you go into the spiritual
[44:44] part of man which is memory reason
[44:46] conscious affections love desires etc
[44:49] etc dealing with the spiritual part of
[44:52] man and and we can look at those things
[44:55] and you can love
[44:56] God that that's the secret of the end
[44:59] times that people don't understand
[45:00] seemingly if you can actually love God
[45:02] and still be
[45:04] lost why wouldn't you want to love
[45:08] God I mean look at us why wouldn't you
[45:11] want to love God that's now a lot of you
[45:13] are not old enough to realize anything
[45:15] that that that I can talk about but you
[45:18] think about that that in 71 years I went
[45:22] from 7 years old pling a mule out in the
[45:25] field digging in
[45:28] dirt all right trying to make a living
[45:32] we
[45:32] was there was nine of us and we had to
[45:35] all work all right but then you go from
[45:39] that to where in the old houses we lived
[45:42] in was barns
[45:46] today you could see through the floor
[45:48] you could see through the walls you
[45:49] could see through this the 10 and we
[45:53] remember when we'd be in the night and
[45:54] it start raining with if somebody had to
[45:56] jump up and get all the pots and pans
[45:58] and set them all over the house lot of
[46:01] you are not old enough to even think
[46:02] about those things but my point is look
[46:05] what man has been able to do in just the
[46:08] 70 years that I've been alive we went
[46:11] from and that was you know coming on up
[46:13] to the
[46:14] 40s and
[46:17] uh but man in 100 years was set that
[46:20] away has went from a horse and
[46:22] buggy to putting an astronaut into outer
[46:25] space you that's right that's right why
[46:28] because he has the ability some
[46:32] way to think things out to reason things
[46:37] out to you know pull from his inner part
[46:43] of him as I said a while ago that people
[46:45] can actually Bend
[46:47] metal by just concentrating upon it can
[46:50] actually do things that are looking
[46:52] almost
[46:53] impossible but they can do it
[46:56] because they're human
[46:57] beings and being a human
[47:01] being we are something very special then
[47:06] right that soul that is within you is so
[47:12] valuable until God one day came down and
[47:16] gave his own life to be able to save
[47:20] you now that's how valuable a man is he
[47:24] didn't come down to save the animal
[47:26] right come on there's under the curse
[47:28] they're out there and they will be one
[47:30] day delivered from all these things we
[47:32] understand the
[47:33] scripture but yet God T so much of man
[47:36] till he come down and give his own self
[47:37] to where he could save that
[47:40] person amen he loves
[47:44] mankind where do you think we get all of
[47:46] these thoughts from the prophet of God
[47:48] one day said it like this he said
[47:50] science has broken into God's
[47:53] laboratory that's a good way to say it
[47:55] you know science has actually broken
[47:58] into God's laboratory look at it look
[48:00] what they can do right taking my hand
[48:03] there enough Adams to blow 10 million
[48:06] worlds
[48:07] away and you can't see
[48:09] it where did he get those things
[48:12] from what caused him to be able to bring
[48:16] these things to
[48:17] pass was
[48:21] because that he's a child of God now get
[48:24] what I'm saying about
[48:27] this just because I say that every
[48:29] person in the world is a child of God
[48:31] I'm not talking about every person in
[48:32] the world saved now don't don't get that
[48:34] tired of what I'm talking about right no
[48:36] no that's not it you got to accept your
[48:38] salvation you got to do that yourself
[48:40] right I'm just saying the way God made
[48:44] us and he's our creator he he is our Our
[48:48] God he's our father in the basis of
[48:50] creation
[48:52] right he created us
[48:56] for a special purpose to
[49:01] Fellowship he didn't want to fellowship
[49:03] with just the angels He had them he
[49:06] didn't want to just fellowship with the
[49:07] animals he had them he wanted something
[49:09] more that would be like his
[49:12] image and things I encourage you
[49:16] children to use your mental
[49:18] faculties always have I always wanted
[49:20] the kids I demanded the kids at least
[49:22] get a high school education what they
[49:24] done after then was between them they
[49:26] they had to take care of those things
[49:27] but I I I demanded them to get a high
[49:30] school education because I I didn't have
[49:33] the opportunity to get one and and doing
[49:36] that you know I I I quit in the ninth
[49:38] grade started a little bit in the 10th
[49:39] grade and uh I I I never had an
[49:42] opportunity to get an education I always
[49:44] really wanted to go back and and and and
[49:46] it wouldn't bother me today I'd love to
[49:48] to be able to just go to college but I
[49:50] know it flunk because every time that
[49:52] they open their mouth it'd be like Anna
[49:54] was when she was trying to to go and and
[49:57] you know they demanded that she write
[49:59] down their answers and I said you write
[50:00] down their answers and if you want to
[50:02] write yours down beside of it if they
[50:04] question you about it we'll go to court
[50:05] and see what they say you know cuz you
[50:07] just put down their answers and Let It
[50:09] Go CU it's the only way you going to get
[50:11] an
[50:12] education but yet see
[50:15] children go to school and learn right in
[50:19] this society that we live
[50:21] in you don't want to be illiterate cuz
[50:24] that's what I'm get
[50:26] literacy because I don't have the the
[50:29] education you don't want to be that go
[50:32] to school and
[50:33] learn you might be an Einstein if
[50:35] there's a world tomorrow you know what
[50:39] time because that's way it works use
[50:43] that brain you've
[50:44] got you know learn think things out I
[50:49] watch little Abby she's 4 years old and
[50:51] she'll learn to do things well that's
[50:55] wonderful
[50:56] encourage your children to do that she
[50:59] started out and they and we got tickles
[51:01] out we was eating the other day and she
[51:03] looked up and she was pointing to these
[51:05] things on the wall what it is they got
[51:07] these uh movie stars up on the wall but
[51:10] they got a big head and a little bitty
[51:12] body well you know she was just pointing
[51:15] at it and talking about it but see when
[51:16] she draws that's the way she draws
[51:18] she'll draw a big head eyes nose ears
[51:22] hair and everything you know and then
[51:24] she'll have a little be body because you
[51:27] know that's just they're thinking and
[51:29] they're doing but I was watching her and
[51:31] the other day you know what she looked
[51:33] around and she had draw and she'll say
[51:35] and she'll tell me this is
[51:37] Poppy and she'll draw me with just a
[51:39] little bit
[51:42] High she draw her mother and she had a
[51:45] whole lot of high you know all right and
[51:48] she draw one of me and you know what she
[51:54] put
[51:56] she draw glasses she said poppy that's
[52:01] when you're reading the
[52:04] Bible study because encourage them
[52:08] though to do those things because you're
[52:10] you're working that inward part of you
[52:12] and and it's the soul of that
[52:16] individual there's no limit to what it
[52:19] is that's why the Bible said that he had
[52:20] to put them out in the in geneses
[52:22] remember because there was nothing with
[52:25] Holden from man
[52:27] right the imagination of man's heart is
[52:30] continually evil but yet look what he's
[52:32] done with all of his
[52:34] evil I don't want you to think now what
[52:37] is a
[52:38] soul what are
[52:43] we now in a sense an animal has a c feel
[52:47] smelling here right all right in a sense
[52:51] he has a form of memory reason cons
[52:55] ience affections
[52:56] Etc they love their little babies they
[52:59] they do and and things but yet they're
[53:02] they're you
[53:03] know they are are are
[53:06] limited all right but they don't have
[53:09] the soul to be able to reason anything
[53:12] out in the highest
[53:15] form because that Soul that's within you
[53:18] God made you that way you know
[53:21] why now we've covered this point but
[53:24] listen he made made you that way or made
[53:26] all of us that
[53:28] way to be able to fellowship with
[53:32] us but he made us that way knowing that
[53:35] one day he would come and bring
[53:39] Salvation you remember we was up in
[53:41] heaven stayed up there a long time in
[53:43] our studies and now we've dropped down
[53:45] to earth all right so God made man in
[53:49] the
[53:51] garden and even though mankind fail he
[53:55] still is using that that he made him and
[53:59] that will be what he contacts that
[54:01] person
[54:03] with he was back there in the Old
[54:05] Testament that's why I said it give it
[54:07] about
[54:08] David David said my soul thirst after
[54:12] that there was something about him the
[54:15] Bible said you know sacrifice and
[54:17] offerings I would us not but an honest
[54:20] and a contrite heart is what God looks
[54:23] at amen because that's where he's
[54:25] dealing with us and you can look back
[54:28] there and see that he was dealing with
[54:30] those
[54:32] people but there was just no way to
[54:34] bring in to Salvation because the animal
[54:37] was made a
[54:39] sacrifice all
[54:41] right but yet there was no life in the
[54:44] animal that could come back upon the
[54:47] human how could that the life of a a
[54:50] lamb come back on a human being it it
[54:53] won't
[54:54] work
[54:55] but it all spoke of a time when the Lamb
[54:58] of God would come upon the Earth right
[55:00] and give his own life to be able to to
[55:03] bring us to the
[55:05] place that we
[55:07] could search after that
[55:09] God he made you with a desire you go
[55:13] around the world it didn't matter where
[55:15] you go whether you go to a place in in
[55:18] Africa back in where that they they've
[55:20] never even seen or heard of the name of
[55:22] Jesus or or live in a little old Tri of
[55:25] their own that maybe he never hardly
[55:27] seen anything
[55:29] else and yet they're
[55:32] worshiping
[55:35] right they make all kind of
[55:39] images they make all kind of little
[55:43] idols and they
[55:45] believe not that that Idol that they've
[55:48] made is there
[55:51] God come
[55:54] on they know it's a stick or something
[55:56] they
[55:57] made but they believe that that's in the
[56:00] image of their God or likeness or
[56:02] thoughts of it right you know because
[56:04] their mind is upon their
[56:08] creator the old
[56:10] Indian he
[56:13] worshiped you see God could deal with
[56:15] those
[56:16] people who was it gono or coach Chief
[56:19] one of two I believe it was jono even
[56:21] saw Visions right that's why they had
[56:23] trouble trying to Capt him a lot of
[56:26] times God could speak to those people
[56:29] right because that they were human
[56:32] beings it's not that you got to be saved
[56:35] for God can speak to you you better get
[56:37] that out of your mind because you
[56:38] remember there was a time you was lost
[56:40] and God had to speak to you
[56:44] right but see there's something that he
[56:46] wanted to
[56:49] communicate he wanted to communicate
[56:51] with a being right cuz he's a being
[56:54] we've been through that
[56:55] I don't believe God is like the wind
[56:56] just blowing to and fro just you know no
[56:59] no cuz if he did you would never have to
[57:01] seek salvation it just blow inside of
[57:03] you and then blow back out you wouldn't
[57:04] have to seek it right see God is a being
[57:07] he's real amen and being a real God he
[57:10] wanted something to where he could
[57:12] Fellowship right and even in our fallen
[57:17] estate he can fellowship with
[57:22] us don't you remember when you when you
[57:25] was a kid or something and God dealing
[57:26] with you I've told you my
[57:29] experiences if I have followed what was
[57:31] dealing with me when I was a child i'
[57:33] never went and done
[57:34] wrong cuz that's a soul the soul of an
[57:38] individual is really to put it down in
[57:40] in in terms like this to help us it's
[57:43] really a moral
[57:45] obligation to do good
[57:49] right why because you were created to be
[57:52] good that's right you wasn't created to
[57:54] to be
[57:55] wrong you were created to be good right
[57:58] you wasn't created to
[58:01] lie you were created to tell the truth
[58:05] to prove that they can put a machine on
[58:07] you and tell whether you're lying or not
[58:09] right right a lot of teor and then you
[58:11] tell whether you're lying or not why
[58:13] because you wasn't made to lie you
[58:15] wasn't made for that purpose right you
[58:17] was made for the purpose to be able to
[58:19] where God could contact you amen now as
[58:23] I said it I keep saying it the animals
[58:25] he could fellowship with them that was
[58:28] fine he could talk to
[58:30] them you know and understand their
[58:33] coings and their their doings and and
[58:35] all like that he could fellowship with
[58:37] them but that wasn't what he
[58:40] wanted he wanted somebody that would be
[58:43] like him so he created Adam created him
[58:46] perfect everything was
[58:48] beautiful but when man fell from that
[58:50] estate it didn't just annihilate
[58:52] everything God didn't say well but y'all
[58:55] done it now going on just liveing I'm
[58:57] going back up in heaven step there no he
[59:00] come right down and he's been down here
[59:01] ever since then trying to help
[59:04] us trying to fellowship with
[59:07] us why because of the Soul that's within
[59:10] you
[59:13] right something that makes you different
[59:15] than an
[59:18] animal you just think about how God
[59:21] created
[59:22] you and you know that he didn't created
[59:25] all of us to be the
[59:27] same well sizewise we're different you
[59:29] know we're different male female
[59:34] Etc but
[59:36] yet he made all of us with a desire
[59:39] that's
[59:42] right come on now no matter where you
[59:46] would go in the world today you would
[59:47] find people that are not Christians as
[59:49] we call
[59:50] it but they have a
[59:53] desire
[59:55] they have
[59:56] aone David back there where he was at
[59:59] there was no Holy Ghost to get within
[1:00:00] David to be able to give him the new
[1:00:02] birth as we'd call
[1:00:05] it but mankind had a long in within him
[1:00:09] to find
[1:00:11] God what made David so different than
[1:00:14] anybody
[1:00:16] else what made it to the basis that I've
[1:00:18] tried to preach it to you before that
[1:00:21] this person over here go out and kill
[1:00:22] somebody and
[1:00:25] the law says kill
[1:00:28] him David had a man killed took his wife
[1:00:31] and done all kind of dirty garbage
[1:00:36] cans and yet he didn't die
[1:00:41] why you said he's a king no that doesn't
[1:00:44] make no difference it didn't matter
[1:00:46] where it's King a
[1:00:48] priest you know remember one of the
[1:00:50] Kings there one time that that decided
[1:00:52] he was going to go in and he was going
[1:00:53] to make stop that sacrifices he had seen
[1:00:56] them do it and he decided Well I'm King
[1:00:58] I can do what I want to They begged him
[1:00:59] not
[1:01:01] to he went in he was struck with what
[1:01:04] with Leprosy I
[1:01:05] think and had that the rest of his
[1:01:08] life why because it wasn't his office it
[1:01:11] wasn't his calling he wasn't supposed to
[1:01:13] be doing
[1:01:15] that but you see what about the priest
[1:01:17] now he could go in what was the
[1:01:19] difference in
[1:01:20] David the said the Bible says you know
[1:01:23] sacrifice God finally got fed up with
[1:01:25] all that sacrifice it just stink in his
[1:01:28] nostrils he said but he said an honest
[1:01:31] and a contrite heart what did David
[1:01:36] have coming from the bed of B Sheba in
[1:01:40] adultery that we were talking about and
[1:01:43] yet he cries
[1:01:45] out return unto me the joy of thy
[1:01:49] salvation that's right he knew he didn't
[1:01:52] have any cuz he done goofed up right
[1:01:56] right but he said return unto me the joy
[1:01:59] of thy
[1:02:03] salvation an honest and a contrite
[1:02:08] heart what is
[1:02:10] that now David could in one split cut a
[1:02:13] man's
[1:02:16] stroke it's not talking about
[1:02:18] that right when he was fighting for
[1:02:21] doings he was fighting to Bar the line
[1:02:23] the giant I mean he he was ready to to
[1:02:26] to
[1:02:29] kill but down inside of him was
[1:02:32] something that God could look at and say
[1:02:34] and the Bible actually calls David a man
[1:02:36] after God's Own Heart that's right it
[1:02:39] actually call in the apple of God's eye
[1:02:44] right now was he the apple of God's eye
[1:02:47] when he was in the bed of adultery with
[1:02:48] a bash Sheba no no no no that that's
[1:02:51] don't go
[1:02:53] carnal
[1:02:55] but yet he was
[1:02:56] repentant
[1:03:00] right he was
[1:03:03] repentant he repented of what he was
[1:03:06] doing and God would hear him amen you
[1:03:10] remember Nathan when he went into to
[1:03:12] David and David he went through the long
[1:03:14] story with David you know about the
[1:03:16] sheep and the different things and the
[1:03:17] one had the one little one and and David
[1:03:19] himself said bring that man here in
[1:03:21] other words I'll kill
[1:03:23] him that's what he said David you're the
[1:03:26] man
[1:03:28] right David knew right then it meant
[1:03:32] death and had it not been for Nathan the
[1:03:34] prophet it would have been
[1:03:37] right Nathan said but God has told me to
[1:03:41] come and tell you you won't die but the
[1:03:45] child will die and this will be with you
[1:03:48] the rest of your days and you will not
[1:03:51] even be allowed to build me a house
[1:03:54] that's right you can get everything
[1:03:56] ready and he did he got it ready for
[1:03:57] Solomon but remember Solomon built a
[1:03:59] house that's right see he was put under
[1:04:02] the curse because of the things he done
[1:04:04] but yet he was so in to the point that
[1:04:07] that Soul cried
[1:04:11] out see that's what God looks at amen
[1:04:14] amen the soul of the individual that's
[1:04:17] right body wise we're all human beings
[1:04:19] that's right black white yellow green
[1:04:22] whates it make any difference
[1:04:25] ain't no
[1:04:28] difference black man give me a blood
[1:04:30] transfusion you'd be tickled to death
[1:04:32] get one if you needed it you might sit
[1:04:34] back and be a a whatever those words are
[1:04:37] racist or whatever I never do get them
[1:04:39] right but you might sit back and say I
[1:04:41] hate them black people but you sure
[1:04:42] don't question them when you go down to
[1:04:44] the hospital and you go in and they
[1:04:46] going to give you some blood well is
[1:04:47] that a black guy to give the blood I
[1:04:48] don't want it well that's the only part
[1:04:51] we
[1:04:52] got that's right right oh go ahead and
[1:04:55] get
[1:04:56] to right things
[1:05:00] changes when you get in
[1:05:03] trouble you soldiers that was out there
[1:05:06] and doing you know you might have been
[1:05:09] one thing over here but when you in the
[1:05:10] Foxhole getting shot at you better
[1:05:13] believe it didn't matter what the color
[1:05:14] the guy was on the other side of you
[1:05:16] that's
[1:05:17] right but get my point of what I'm
[1:05:19] trying to say a soul of a
[1:05:23] man
[1:05:27] made to want to serve
[1:05:32] God made for a longing and in in
[1:05:36] there to serve
[1:05:38] God we answer it with the world
[1:05:44] right had I known what I know now I
[1:05:46] would have never went into the world as
[1:05:48] I
[1:05:49] did amen that's right amen is that the
[1:05:53] way you
[1:05:54] are if we could change things it'd be a
[1:05:57] lot different wouldn't
[1:06:00] it you see we over Road you know we went
[1:06:03] over we we we went across the boundaries
[1:06:06] that God was trying to tell us not to do
[1:06:10] that if he could tell a hot and toot in
[1:06:13] Africa to be
[1:06:17] good and then your Prophet go over there
[1:06:19] and he said said I went into those
[1:06:21] tribes and things and he said not find
[1:06:24] one case of venial disease we think
[1:06:28] that's where the dirty things was at and
[1:06:30] all the dirty things is here in the what
[1:06:33] we call
[1:06:34] civilization right why because they were
[1:06:37] pure and made
[1:06:39] rip had to take a mergency test before
[1:06:42] they could get married and if they
[1:06:44] failed it they killed them and the man
[1:06:49] also what would happen
[1:06:52] today which did you see God made us to
[1:06:56] long after him to desire
[1:07:00] him and even in our fallen the
[1:07:04] state we still have that
[1:07:08] desire we still want to serve him cuz
[1:07:11] we're not a dog or a
[1:07:13] cat we're a human
[1:07:16] mortal that is made to long after
[1:07:20] God made to desire something to work you
[1:07:24] know you know yourself the first drink
[1:07:27] you took you was told not to take it
[1:07:29] something inside of you said don't do
[1:07:30] that that's the soul right that's the
[1:07:33] moral obligation of the inside of you
[1:07:36] that told you don't do it right had you
[1:07:39] listened to that had we paid attention
[1:07:41] to those things we wouldn't have went
[1:07:42] out and done like we' done right that's
[1:07:45] right why because he was trying to deal
[1:07:47] with
[1:07:48] us but yet being like David we could go
[1:07:51] out and have a man's wife have a man
[1:07:54] killed to get his wife to cover up our
[1:07:56] adulterous
[1:08:00] act he go out and just Liv in garbage
[1:08:05] cans in the world of sin
[1:08:12] right but thank God God never left
[1:08:18] us he don't leave man he's still right
[1:08:20] there with you that's
[1:08:22] right you you can preach salvation any
[1:08:24] way you want to I preach it to what I
[1:08:26] believe the prophet of God said every
[1:08:29] man was born with that special gift what
[1:08:32] to want to serve God
[1:08:35] right no matter who we are right you
[1:08:38] want to serve
[1:08:39] God yeah we turned to the world of sin
[1:08:42] and done those things and went after it
[1:08:44] why because we are able to make
[1:08:47] decisions had we been animals we would
[1:08:49] have not had that ability that's
[1:08:52] right
[1:08:54] nothing immoral in the animal
[1:08:56] kingdom only for
[1:09:00] reproduction right that's right because
[1:09:03] that's what it is but in the human realm
[1:09:06] we're made to word that
[1:09:09] see now immorality or what you want to
[1:09:11] say it is rampant across the
[1:09:15] world until it is getting into Africa
[1:09:18] and places that you'd say that started
[1:09:20] out real pure and then you find out
[1:09:22] that's where a lot of these diseases
[1:09:24] does come
[1:09:25] from why because the white man went
[1:09:28] there the Indian was doing wonderful
[1:09:31] here in
[1:09:33] America didn't have no diseases didn't
[1:09:35] have no problems we came over here and
[1:09:37] gave him all kind of things and gave him
[1:09:39] moonshine gave him you know give him
[1:09:43] liquor made him
[1:09:47] crazy and we took his land away from
[1:09:52] him cuz see that's what we can
[1:09:55] think we can reason
[1:09:58] out we can reason out that's what we do
[1:10:00] we reason out and we you know we say
[1:10:03] well you know here we are we just and we
[1:10:05] say we've got to lay this out we got to
[1:10:07] make a city we got to make a a rulings
[1:10:10] out of these things until we rued
[1:10:12] ourselves to
[1:10:14] death then that's from the soul of
[1:10:18] man cuz he has that ability to think
[1:10:20] things
[1:10:22] out
[1:10:26] right but what if we took that and
[1:10:28] turned it to God what if we take it
[1:10:30] today and turn it to God
[1:10:35] Amen talking about the soul of man yes
[1:10:40] what would we be if we just listen to
[1:10:42] that inward part
[1:10:48] amen God is right there always handy
[1:10:51] he's never away that's right
[1:10:54] that's right you can go through the
[1:10:57] Genesis sure and you can get up and and
[1:10:59] preach about how that it was made the
[1:11:01] word that the man was to to have to work
[1:11:03] for a living you know in the sweat of
[1:11:05] his brow and the woman was to be under
[1:11:07] her husband subjected to him and all
[1:11:10] that's good and well
[1:11:12] right but none of that converts the soul
[1:11:15] that's
[1:11:19] right just don't turn down when God's
[1:11:22] dealing with that soul
[1:11:25] right cuz the Bible said he won't always
[1:11:28] drive with man that's right he gave man
[1:11:31] 120 years in the days of Noah right
[1:11:36] right but that was
[1:11:41] it he's promised us so much time on
[1:11:43] Earth but that's it right
[1:11:46] right what about that
[1:11:49] Soul what about that longing within your
[1:11:52] heart and that desire
[1:11:55] have you quenched it with something
[1:12:00] else have you let the world and
[1:12:02] everything else take away from you the
[1:12:04] the desire to want to serve
[1:12:07] God cuz remember you're not going out
[1:12:09] into sin until you turn down God's word
[1:12:11] first right that's what I've started off
[1:12:14] with and that's where we're still at
[1:12:16] that's what happened with Eve in the
[1:12:17] garden right she first took God's I mean
[1:12:20] to Satan's words through the Beast
[1:12:24] the snake as you want to call it made of
[1:12:30] Beast she took it in her
[1:12:33] head then it went down into her being in
[1:12:36] her spirit realm and she began to reason
[1:12:38] and
[1:12:40] things and he began to tell her wasn't
[1:12:42] this what she was made
[1:12:45] for and she listened
[1:12:48] yes
[1:12:50] kids when that thing starts telling you
[1:12:53] thing
[1:12:57] just
[1:12:59] remember somebody else is trying to talk
[1:13:01] to you too right
[1:13:04] amen don't listen to that
[1:13:08] thing oh he'll show you how beautiful
[1:13:11] everything is he'll show you how
[1:13:12] beautiful life is and what all of this
[1:13:14] stuff is and how it's
[1:13:19] wonderful he don't show you the garbage
[1:13:21] can you wind up being in that's
[1:13:26] right don't show you how you wind up
[1:13:28] giving yourself to other people in your
[1:13:30] bodies and things like that and I'm show
[1:13:32] you how you begin to drink and do dope
[1:13:37] and
[1:13:38] right oh it looks good
[1:13:44] yes but then go down sometimes and look
[1:13:46] in the garbage canins of the
[1:13:48] world and see what it's done to people
[1:13:50] like that yep
[1:13:55] sure you feel good maybe with you dope I
[1:13:57] never done nothing like that never drink
[1:13:59] never done any of thank God for it I
[1:14:01] wouldn't saved either I was lost I just
[1:14:03] didn't care nothing about it mainly I
[1:14:05] couldn't afford it you'll be
[1:14:09] blunt we were so poor I couldn't
[1:14:13] afford me and my wife when I got married
[1:14:16] and 1958 I made $42 a
[1:14:22] week paying rent light bill couldn't
[1:14:25] afford a
[1:14:26] phone old clunker car that my dad-in-law
[1:14:29] took care of him kep it
[1:14:34] running couldn't afford to do the things
[1:14:36] a lot of you wound up with money to be
[1:14:38] able to do but the money you wound up
[1:14:40] with wound up being a
[1:14:43] curse cuz you wound up going to the
[1:14:45] world with it right don't do it amen
[1:14:49] listen to that inward part of you that's
[1:14:51] the soul amen soul of an individual is
[1:14:55] so wonderful until that's the part god
[1:14:57] deals with that's
[1:14:59] right he has to deal through your brain
[1:15:01] to get to you yes he has to deal through
[1:15:04] your memory reason conscious affs cuz
[1:15:06] that's part of you cuz you're a tri
[1:15:08] being but he's really trying to speak to
[1:15:10] that Soul
[1:15:13] right see he tried back there to get
[1:15:15] within the man but there was no way to
[1:15:17] do
[1:15:19] it David could long after God but yet he
[1:15:23] could right around and walk after the
[1:15:24] things of the
[1:15:25] world cuz there was no way that animal
[1:15:28] life could come back and free the man it
[1:15:32] could only cover the person right to
[1:15:36] keep them from being
[1:15:39] destroyed but a
[1:15:41] soul look at a little
[1:15:44] kid you look at these little children I
[1:15:47] love to watch them I like to watch them
[1:15:51] grow I like to watch them be able to do
[1:15:54] things to
[1:15:57] read to do i' like to watch
[1:16:01] that because I watch them as they're
[1:16:04] doing and do it on your
[1:16:07] own you know that you're one of your
[1:16:10] great presidents Abraham Lincoln he had
[1:16:12] to teach himself to read I think went
[1:16:14] the Bible wouldn't it but he had to
[1:16:16] teach himself to
[1:16:18] read wind up being president of the
[1:16:20] United
[1:16:22] States
[1:16:24] but see if he stayed where he wouldn't
[1:16:25] been able to read he wouldn't be
[1:16:27] president
[1:16:29] right CU it wouldn't had even though
[1:16:32] everybody else couldn't read they still
[1:16:33] want the president could
[1:16:36] read but just think about these
[1:16:40] things even in your Fallen
[1:16:45] estate let's just read a few quotes just
[1:16:47] to get the point where you'll see what
[1:16:49] the prophet had to say about it and then
[1:16:51] we'll we'll close on
[1:16:53] go ahead
[1:16:55] brother look what the prophet had to say
[1:16:57] e22 1956
[1:17:00] 527 and Cates
[1:17:03] barnea now we can't create
[1:17:06] Timber but we can take Timber after God
[1:17:09] has created it and make a house out of
[1:17:12] it because we're offsprings of
[1:17:15] God think about it Sons and Daughters of
[1:17:19] God no matter how Fallen we are
[1:17:24] still we have to recognize that we are
[1:17:26] Sons and Daughters of God in our fallen
[1:17:30] estate we're still Sons and Daughters of
[1:17:32] God a't that something
[1:17:36] right no matter what we are we're still
[1:17:39] the children of God
[1:17:41] Amen even in a fallen estate going down
[1:17:44] to the next let's just read through
[1:17:45] three of these and we
[1:17:47] quit Divine love Eve 17
[1:17:51] 1956 82
[1:17:55] six look what he said now we want to
[1:17:58] talk of
[1:18:01] facts now the reason that is is because
[1:18:04] of the atmosphere that the individual
[1:18:06] himself or herself
[1:18:07] creates now
[1:18:11] listen because you're an you're a
[1:18:14] miniature
[1:18:17] Creator right now all I've been talking
[1:18:20] about
[1:18:20] now because your sons and Daughters of
[1:18:23] God no matter how far you sto in sin
[1:18:26] you're still Sons and Daughters of God
[1:18:29] because you're fallen degenerated in
[1:18:31] your soul and mind but God is your
[1:18:33] creator and in your Fallen estate you
[1:18:36] are lost undone creature of God
[1:18:39] dominated by the devil that's right but
[1:18:41] still your sons and daughters of God now
[1:18:45] what's he talking
[1:18:47] about by creation
[1:18:50] right he don't give us salvation because
[1:18:53] we are human
[1:18:56] beings the dogs and cats ought to get it
[1:18:59] first you agree y That's Right plain
[1:19:03] language but they already get it before
[1:19:05] we
[1:19:06] do because they're not like us that's
[1:19:09] right but even in our fallen
[1:19:11] estate God still wants to deal with
[1:19:15] us but under the next you'll see where
[1:19:17] we that's getting
[1:19:19] to E15 Fellowship 1960
[1:19:24] now God wanted
[1:19:27] fellowship and if we no matter if men
[1:19:29] today is a fallen Son of God there's
[1:19:32] some parts of God still with that man in
[1:19:35] his Fallen
[1:19:37] State some parts you're not talking
[1:19:40] about
[1:19:41] salvation you're talking about a
[1:19:45] desire a longing to serve God you take a
[1:19:49] man today that can split an atom or
[1:19:51] molecule or whatever you want to to call
[1:19:53] it you can drive a jet plane around the
[1:19:56] world in a few hours you see that he is
[1:19:59] something in him is a fallen
[1:20:02] creation now he cannot create anything
[1:20:05] but he can pervert what has been created
[1:20:07] into something to better
[1:20:09] himself and that shows that man never
[1:20:13] come from animal life because animal
[1:20:15] life continually builds the same Habit
[1:20:18] habitations to live in but man makes him
[1:20:23] a better house a better way of living
[1:20:25] better clothes and better
[1:20:26] transportation now all that shows that
[1:20:28] there's something behind even in Fallen
[1:20:31] State he still
[1:20:35] there I always say to you how many wants
[1:20:37] to drive home today in a a
[1:20:40] model oh you'd like to have it where you
[1:20:42] could sell it but what if we all that's
[1:20:44] all we had I don't want to go back to
[1:20:48] that we used to push him a
[1:20:51] lot
[1:20:54] all
[1:20:55] right how many would like to go back to
[1:20:57] living in the homes we used to live
[1:21:01] in but nobody could sneak up on you
[1:21:03] because you could see them
[1:21:08] coming how many would like to go back
[1:21:13] to you know old food's good but still
[1:21:16] how many wants to go back to the old ear
[1:21:19] corn I don't maybe I'm CL ized to the
[1:21:23] world so much until I sure do love this
[1:21:25] tender sweet corn man that old corn we
[1:21:29] used to get it was about two days too
[1:21:31] old and you you had problems
[1:21:35] chewing but you
[1:21:38] see because of a
[1:21:41] soul we're able to better ourselves
[1:21:45] that's
[1:21:46] right now we will never be able to
[1:21:49] better ourselves into
[1:21:51] salvation don't never get get that
[1:21:55] idea because the smarter we get the
[1:21:58] Dumber we
[1:22:00] become the smarter we get the further
[1:22:03] away from God we try to determine to
[1:22:07] be well brother Dale you read some
[1:22:09] quotes and you got a whole lot more
[1:22:11] there talking about that we're Sons and
[1:22:12] Daughters of God right but that's by
[1:22:15] natural creation right that's not
[1:22:17] eternal life
[1:22:20] right that is a person that can live
[1:22:23] upon this Earth and even love God and
[1:22:25] enjoy life there are good people in this
[1:22:28] world this is not a bad world they're
[1:22:31] good people yes there's people out there
[1:22:35] that would help you do things and do for
[1:22:37] you they're good people yes sir but that
[1:22:39] don't give salvation that's right amen
[1:22:43] see salvation can only come through
[1:22:44] Jesus
[1:22:46] Christ and that meant that he had to
[1:22:48] come into this
[1:22:50] world as a mortal human being in the
[1:22:52] bases of a body that's right right a
[1:22:56] body thou H has prepared Hebrews 10:5 a
[1:22:58] body thou has prepar God stepped into
[1:23:01] that
[1:23:02] body there when the baby was
[1:23:06] born and become Emmanuel God With
[1:23:10] Us but he was born for a
[1:23:13] purpose and that purpose was to die
[1:23:18] amen that he might release that life yes
[1:23:22] cuz the life it didn't matter how many
[1:23:23] times they died it didn't make any
[1:23:25] difference how many animals you
[1:23:26] sacrifice right you couldn't come
[1:23:31] back see because man having a soul or
[1:23:34] being a soul is a better way of saying
[1:23:36] it not having one being a soul of a
[1:23:39] being what you
[1:23:42] are and no matter what you are there's
[1:23:45] still a desire down within there to want
[1:23:47] to serve God that's just don't turn it
[1:23:51] away
[1:23:54] God had to give his own life to be able
[1:23:56] to come and live in you and I
[1:23:58] yes he didn't take your soul out and
[1:24:01] destroy
[1:24:03] it he just worked on the nature of it
[1:24:07] cuz the nature of your soul or our souls
[1:24:10] were
[1:24:12] perverted little kids what happened to
[1:24:15] that
[1:24:16] Soul born in this domain this
[1:24:21] world you don't have to teach a kid the
[1:24:24] lie you just let him get about 2 years
[1:24:26] old and gets cookie on his face and
[1:24:28] cookie in his hand and you ask him to
[1:24:30] eating a cooking he said
[1:24:32] mm you don't have to teach him he just
[1:24:35] born in this
[1:24:36] domain right but yet God is still
[1:24:39] dealing with that little
[1:24:42] soul that little soul if it would listen
[1:24:45] would grow up to be right and turn out
[1:24:47] to search after God
[1:24:50] right because that's what God made us
[1:24:53] for amen he made the soul of man to
[1:24:56] where that we could accept him into our
[1:24:59] soul body to body he's my brother
[1:25:03] right right Jesus Christ is my brother
[1:25:06] that's why the Bible say he's not
[1:25:07] ashamed to call him Brethren he's my
[1:25:10] brother brother to brother he's human he
[1:25:12] was a mortal
[1:25:14] body but inside of there was a soul and
[1:25:17] a
[1:25:18] spirit that was almighty
[1:25:21] God he can come and deal with us in our
[1:25:24] spirit realm and and we begin to
[1:25:26] straighten up and want to do right and
[1:25:27] that's good that's
[1:25:31] right soul to soul is where the life of
[1:25:35] God comes to live in
[1:25:37] you that's what we call the New Birth
[1:25:39] you know getting saved
[1:25:42] salvation coming and living inside of
[1:25:46] us to give us his life cuz that was his
[1:25:51] purpose
[1:25:53] right the purpose for creating
[1:25:57] man come on creating him like he did
[1:26:01] above the animals giving him a
[1:26:03] soul was for the fact that he knew one
[1:26:05] day he'd come and live in that
[1:26:09] person and that would be his be his
[1:26:11] ultimate
[1:26:13] desire then would be we would be then
[1:26:16] the children of
[1:26:17] God by new birth right Paul call New
[1:26:22] Creation new creature old things are
[1:26:25] passed away the Bible
[1:26:29] says and see we become a Christian by
[1:26:32] accepting Jesus Christ letting him come
[1:26:35] into our
[1:26:37] soul and live and give us eternal
[1:26:41] life soul of man is the most wonderful
[1:26:44] thing cuz that's what God created as far
[1:26:46] to where he' eventually be able to come
[1:26:47] and live in
[1:26:49] us I hope that goes home with you and
[1:26:52] you think about
[1:26:53] it you were made for that
[1:26:57] reason for God to come down and impart
[1:27:00] his own life right that would make us
[1:27:03] the children of God in a higher state
[1:27:06] her way on higher than to think of a
[1:27:08] natural
[1:27:10] creation and that would make his desire
[1:27:12] to be
[1:27:13] complete where he can come and live in
[1:27:19] man he wants to give his life away
[1:27:21] that's what I've always
[1:27:23] said eternal
[1:27:27] life the one thing that you want to give
[1:27:30] away you so brother Dale you're crazy to
[1:27:32] say you want to give away eternal life I
[1:27:34] know I can't it's just the way I saying
[1:27:37] it I sure wish I
[1:27:40] could you ever ever really got that
[1:27:43] honest and sincere enough to think that
[1:27:45] you would give away the eternal life you
[1:27:47] have no no well then you just don't have
[1:27:50] it that's right I just just put it that
[1:27:52] way just be blunt you don't have what
[1:27:54] I'm talking about cuz once you get it
[1:27:56] you want to give it
[1:27:59] away that's the only reason I
[1:28:03] preach I preach trying to give away what
[1:28:06] God gives me that's right that's the
[1:28:09] only reason I preach sure ain't for
[1:28:11] money sure ain't for popularity sure
[1:28:12] ain't for all that is to want to give
[1:28:15] away what God give
[1:28:19] me think on these things come on brother
[1:28:22] think on these
[1:28:25] things what is
[1:28:33] man excuse me for the wording cuz I
[1:28:35] don't have no education but a product or
[1:28:37] whatever you want to call it of being
[1:28:40] created higher than all the animals as
[1:28:43] I've said probably 10
[1:28:46] times but
[1:28:50] made where God could come and live in us
[1:28:53] and give us eternal life
[1:28:59] amen a wonderful part of you as a
[1:29:02] soul you
[1:29:06] be Brother D I love God you can do that
[1:29:09] with your spirit CU that's where you

[1:29:38] desire but there was no way to answer
[1:29:41] that but not so
