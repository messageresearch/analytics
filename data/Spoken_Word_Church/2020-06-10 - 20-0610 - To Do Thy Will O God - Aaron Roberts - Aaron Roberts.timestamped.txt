[24:17] and
[24:20] y'all just help me out tonight
[24:23] i'll title this to do thy will o god
[24:27] in hebrews chapter 10 verse 1
[24:30] says for the law having a shadow of good
[24:33] things to come and not the very image
[24:36] of of the things can never with those
[24:39] sacrifices which they offered year by
[24:41] year continually
[24:42] make the comers there unto perfect for
[24:45] them would they
[24:47] not have ceased to be offered because
[24:49] that the worshipers once purged
[24:51] should have no more conscience of sin
[24:55] but in those sacrifices there is a
[24:56] remembrance again made of sins every
[24:59] year
[25:00] for it's not possible that the blood of
[25:03] bulls
[25:04] and of goats should take away sins
[25:07] wherefore
[25:08] when he cometh into the world he saith
[25:10] sacrifice
[25:12] and offerings thou wouldest not but a
[25:14] body
[25:15] has thou prepared me and burnt offerings
[25:18] and sacrifices for sin
[25:21] has thou thou hast had no pleasure
[25:25] then said i lo i come in the volume of
[25:28] the book it is written
[25:29] of me to do thy will o god
[25:34] now this is one of the things that
[25:35] caught my he says to do the will o god
[25:38] above when he said sacrifices and
[25:40] offering and burnt offerings and
[25:43] offerings for sin thou wouldest not
[25:45] neither has pleasure
[25:46] therein which are offered by the law
[25:49] then said he
[25:50] lo i come to do thou will o god see i
[25:53] come to do thy will ago he taketh away
[25:55] the first
[25:56] that he may establish the second
[25:59] by the which we are sanctified through
[26:02] the offering
[26:03] of the body of jesus christ once for all
[26:06] amen
[26:07] amen god bless y'all be seated
[26:13] that's all right i may fall apart
[26:18] i don't know what i'm gonna do tonight
[26:19] but
[26:23] you know sometimes the devil jumps on
[26:25] you now
[26:26] the lord lets things happen but you know
[26:29] what
[26:31] we have the victory
[26:35] yeah i tell you what
[26:38] when you get stirred up you know what
[26:41] when the
[26:42] when this when the peace of god and the
[26:44] holy spirit comes and
[26:45] and ministers to you you know what
[26:49] it makes you it makes you appreciate
[26:51] because many times you know
[26:53] the things of the day and the and the
[26:55] the things that we go through in this
[26:56] life
[26:57] can be hard and difficult but let me
[26:59] tell you what when the sweet holy spirit
[27:00] comes and touches you
[27:02] it changes your life
[27:06] and you know what you just can't praise
[27:08] him enough
[27:10] but i want to speak to tonight on to do
[27:14] thy will oh god because
[27:15] and and that's what struck me was when
[27:18] reading this scripture
[27:20] because he said i come in the volume of
[27:22] the book that is written of me
[27:24] to do my thy will o god and then
[27:28] right below that he comes back and then
[27:29] when he's speaking of these
[27:31] sacrifices and offerings and all these
[27:33] things he said lo i come to do thy will
[27:36] o god
[27:37] he said he taketh away the first that he
[27:39] may establish
[27:40] the second amendment and you know
[27:44] you know in the scripture when paul is
[27:47] writing here in the in in hebrews you
[27:49] know and
[27:50] this is very familiar scripture and many
[27:52] times it's been read and been spoken
[27:54] but you know when we go back and we
[27:56] start looking at at this scripture and
[27:58] you know it always amazes me
[28:00] when when you when you go back to that
[28:02] time and you and you look to see what
[28:04] they were doing
[28:05] and many times when you start talking
[28:07] about going into that
[28:10] going before that altar when that
[28:13] worshiper brought
[28:14] that lamb that lamb had to be spotless
[28:20] when when they wanted when they wanted
[28:22] to have communion with
[28:23] god and they wanted to offer this
[28:25] sacrifice they didn't just pick anything
[28:27] they went over that thing with a
[28:29] fine-tooth comb they wanted to make sure
[28:31] that thing was perfect there was no
[28:33] blemishes there was nothing because they
[28:35] wanted to uphold exactly what god told
[28:37] them that it was going to be
[28:38] and when when they brought that thing
[28:40] before before
[28:41] the priest when they brought his his
[28:43] sacrifice
[28:44] and for his for his sin and for his
[28:47] shortcomings and all he brought that
[28:48] lamb up there
[28:50] and you know that lamb was put on that
[28:52] altar and he laid his hands on that on
[28:54] that lamb
[28:54] and he held his hands and he confessed
[28:57] his sins upon that lamb
[28:59] and that lamb was laying there and he
[29:00] confessed his sins as he laid there
[29:02] and then that high priest as he stood
[29:04] there and he held his hands upon that
[29:07] upon that lamb and then the high priest
[29:09] took that knife it was
[29:10] and cut that through that lamb's throat
[29:13] and there it was it was bleeding and the
[29:14] blood was going everywhere and you know
[29:16] he was standing watching this gruesome
[29:18] thing take place
[29:19] but you know he was realizing that that
[29:22] lamb took his place
[29:23] that he ought to have been right there
[29:25] but that lamb took his place and he
[29:27] stood right there
[29:28] and he watched that horrible thing take
[29:30] place and then he stood there
[29:31] and as as that lamb laid there and the
[29:34] high priest burnt that
[29:35] burnt that lamb he burnt that lamb
[29:38] completely all together
[29:40] and we know that you know if you look at
[29:42] this that this scene
[29:43] when when you take a an animal and other
[29:46] ones here
[29:47] have killed animals and when you lay
[29:49] them somewhere and you cut them and you
[29:50] know what takes place when they're
[29:52] when their bowels release and different
[29:54] things you know what it's not a it's not
[29:55] a pretty sight
[29:56] and then when you're having to burn that
[29:58] with fire and you're burning the hair
[30:00] and you're in the intros and everything
[30:02] like that and you know god called that a
[30:04] sweet smelling savor to him but you know
[30:06] what to human
[30:08] thoughts or ideas you know what there
[30:09] was no place that you would want to be
[30:11] but you know what that was taking his
[30:14] place
[30:15] and what what a horrible gruesome thing
[30:17] that was
[30:18] but you know what he walked right up
[30:20] there and he and he
[30:21] went through that whole procedure and
[30:24] through that whole ceremony and you know
[30:25] what he turned around and he walked
[30:27] right out with the same desire that he
[30:28] walked up there with
[30:30] you know because he never could make him
[30:31] free but you know what he just covered
[30:33] his sins
[30:34] and then he turned around and walked
[30:36] away just the same man that he was
[30:39] but you know what thank god there was
[30:41] one that came that that matched
[30:43] the perfect lamb of god that fulfilled
[30:45] all the word and all the scripture
[30:47] that god came himself in human flesh to
[30:50] take that away
[30:51] that when he laid upon the altar of the
[30:54] dying on the cross
[30:55] and he took and he went up there and he
[30:57] took all those stripes upon his back for
[30:59] me
[31:00] that i can have perfect healing and he
[31:02] went upon that and he went up on that
[31:04] cross and he died
[31:05] as the perfect atonement for me one that
[31:08] i may be perfect in myself
[31:10] why not looking back at what i've done
[31:13] but what he's done for me
[31:15] that i can be perfect he became sin
[31:18] who knew no sin that i may become the
[31:21] righteousness of god
[31:24] amen amen
[31:27] god was not pleased in those sacrifices
[31:30] he did not want those burnt offerings
[31:32] but what did he want he wanted that
[31:34] perfect lamb of god that came
[31:36] he came himself because it was what the
[31:38] word had promised
[31:39] it would take place there had to be one
[31:43] that could bridge the chasm between man
[31:46] and god amen
[31:47] amen and he said that he would come and
[31:51] he'd done
[31:53] he said he came to fulfill the word
[31:58] hello i come in the volume of the book
[32:01] that is written of me
[32:02] to do thy will oh god oh glory
[32:07] you know what if i said this last time
[32:09] and i still believe it today
[32:10] if if the if the story of because
[32:14] when when jesus stood there and and
[32:16] matthew
[32:17] and he said go into all the world and
[32:19] preach the gospel well you know what if
[32:21] the power of the gospel doesn't move you
[32:23] if it doesn't thrill you if it doesn't
[32:25] excite you then there's something wrong
[32:27] if we ever get to the place where the
[32:28] word becomes common to us
[32:30] then you know what we need to get back
[32:31] into the altar
[32:35] if if the word doesn't mean anything to
[32:37] us
[32:38] and it's not it's not because you know
[32:40] what every day i wake up you know
[32:42] where i am today and the things that i
[32:43] go through in my life
[32:45] where i am is because of calvary
[32:48] you know there's many people that you
[32:50] see today you know what they're bound
[32:52] and and all and also all the different
[32:54] things that that you can think of
[32:56] and people look at and you go out there
[32:58] and you see people and all of the things
[33:00] that they're so sad
[33:01] and they're so bound by so many things
[33:03] and you know what there but for the
[33:04] grace of god go i
[33:06] but god gave rich in mercy to me has
[33:08] delivered me from those
[33:10] things and you know what it's to it's
[33:12] for us to declare to the world
[33:14] that there is a way made that there has
[33:16] been that is free
[33:18] i didn't have there was nothing that i
[33:20] in myself that was good there's nothing
[33:22] that i could do
[33:23] to receive it but it was by the grace of
[33:25] god
[33:26] amen it's not of works lest any man
[33:29] should boast
[33:30] but it was by the grace of god and you
[33:32] know what it
[33:33] is for us to declare to the whole world
[33:36] that there is the grace of god
[33:41] we're not we're not super humans
[33:47] we're not we're not some great person
[33:50] we're not we're not we're not some
[33:51] special class of people why
[33:53] we're just we're just just like
[33:55] everybody else
[33:59] you know any time anytime we get to the
[34:01] place where we think we can stick our
[34:02] nose up in the air
[34:03] you know then we've got a problem
[34:05] because we've not received the
[34:07] richestness
[34:08] and we've not received the fullness of
[34:10] calvary
[34:13] because if you ever receive a revelation
[34:15] to realize who you are where you came
[34:17] from then you know
[34:18] then you know what you become humble
[34:20] because the more god
[34:21] reveals to you the more humble you
[34:23] become
[34:29] we never want to forget calvary we want
[34:31] to never forget
[34:32] where we came from and what god has done
[34:34] for us
[34:38] that he he became sin
[34:42] he became us that we can become him
[34:46] glory amen
[34:52] you know this i want to read this this
[34:54] quote here this
[34:56] is from the angel of the lord
[34:59] and brother branham says he said no
[35:01] there's many people in the ba
[35:03] in the bible that teach that teaches the
[35:05] bible as a historical book
[35:07] he said which it is and it but it's more
[35:10] than a history
[35:11] he said it's a prophetic book also that
[35:13] foretells it tells what was it tells
[35:16] what will be
[35:17] he said do you accept that to be the
[35:19] truth and now
[35:20] the same jesus that was is and will be
[35:24] see he's the same jesus all the way
[35:26] through the scriptures the same christ
[35:28] all the way through in the beginning
[35:30] he was in the middle of the book he's
[35:32] here
[35:33] lo i come in the volume of the book to
[35:35] do thy will o god
[35:36] o lord and in the end he's alpha omega
[35:39] the beginning then
[35:41] he which was which is and shall come the
[35:44] root and offspring of david the morning
[35:46] star the rose of sharon the lily of the
[35:47] valley
[35:48] while he's he that's that's just him
[35:50] isn't it
[35:51] he's emmanuel he's the root and
[35:53] offspring of david see
[35:55] he says now his ministry carries on
[35:58] now many peop teaching the bible as a
[36:00] history here which is fine
[36:03] he says but he said talking about
[36:05] seminaries he said but you can't find
[36:07] that in school
[36:09] he said you don't know that by genealogy
[36:12] he said you know that by neology on your
[36:15] knees before god it doesn't take
[36:18] education it takes a surrendered heart
[36:21] god works on the heart
[36:25] so many people want to know what god who
[36:28] god is and they want to know more about
[36:30] god
[36:31] and you know there's many people in the
[36:32] world that don't know who god is and
[36:34] they don't want to know about god
[36:37] and that's okay they get to make their
[36:39] own choice
[36:40] but you know there's many people out in
[36:42] the world and and they think they know
[36:43] who god is
[36:44] but they don't know anything about him
[36:47] and so you know they they're trying to
[36:49] find who god is
[36:51] but you know that's who you and i are
[36:53] are the ones
[36:54] to show the world who jesus christ is
[36:57] that jesus christ
[36:58] is the same yesterday today and forever
[37:01] because you know people aren't looking
[37:02] people people are not looking for
[37:04] another book you know there's many
[37:06] people in the world and that's and
[37:07] that's their whole
[37:08] claim in life and that's their whole
[37:10] goal in life is to write a million
[37:12] seller
[37:12] they want to write words they want to
[37:14] get up and they want to be a speaker
[37:15] they want to get
[37:16] and to lecture people and all kinds of
[37:18] stuff well you know what if one person
[37:20] can get up and
[37:21] and speak in psychology then somebody
[37:23] else can get up and speak in psychology
[37:25] and get right behind them
[37:26] and refute exactly what they have to say
[37:28] but there's one thing that you can't
[37:29] refute there's one thing that you can't
[37:31] that you can't uh dispute and overcome
[37:33] and that's the holy ghost
[37:36] and you know you know we don't we don't
[37:38] need people that are educated
[37:39] we've got a lot of people that's read in
[37:41] this message and they've read the books
[37:43] and they've read the bible and they've
[37:44] read a lot of things but the one thing
[37:46] that
[37:46] like brother branham said he said well i
[37:48] may not know the bible real well but he
[37:50] said i know the author real well well
[37:51] there's a lot of people that's read a
[37:53] lot of things but you know what they
[37:54] don't know the author real well
[37:56] they've not they've not had a born-again
[37:57] experience of knowing who the author was
[38:00] and if they did then you know what
[38:01] everything would change
[38:02] because you know we don't need more
[38:04] people reading books and writing books
[38:06] and writing all these kind of things why
[38:08] because we've had many many people have
[38:10] stood in the message and
[38:11] and they've had all their kinds of uh
[38:13] camps and their groups
[38:14] and their and their theology but you
[38:15] know what that ain't got anybody
[38:17] anywhere
[38:19] it takes the holy ghost and it takes an
[38:22] individual affair between each one of us
[38:24] having our own revelation of who jesus
[38:27] is that he can speak to each one of us
[38:29] and many people you know they're trying
[38:31] to find the next person who's going to
[38:32] be the great person to do this and that
[38:34] let me tell you who the great person is
[38:36] as i said last time the greatest of all
[38:38] is jesus christ and that's who we need
[38:40] to
[38:41] look to if we got our eyes on somebody
[38:43] else you know what we're looking in the
[38:44] wrong direction
[38:51] so i want i want to introduce you to the
[38:55] greatest
[38:56] and that's jesus christ i want everybody
[38:58] to know he's the greatest
[38:59] whatever you're looking for he's the one
[39:01] he's your answer
[39:02] whatever the question is the answer is
[39:04] jesus
[39:09] no when when jesus come upon the earth
[39:12] jesus came
[39:12] to do one thing he came to fulfill the
[39:15] scripture
[39:16] and you know there's a the scripture
[39:18] says it that jesus said
[39:20] he said the son can do nothing in
[39:22] himself
[39:23] except what he sees the father do he
[39:25] said that do with the son likewise so we
[39:28] know that when jesus came into the earth
[39:30] he came to do one thing he came to
[39:32] fulfill
[39:32] he said i come in the volume of the book
[39:34] that was written of me
[39:36] and that's that's one thing i want to
[39:37] look at tonight he came in the volume of
[39:40] the book
[39:40] he came in the volume he came in the
[39:43] book
[39:45] you know what when he came in the world
[39:47] he came to fulfill what was written of
[39:49] him
[39:50] so when so when when adam and eve came
[39:53] in the garden
[39:54] and and god spoke and said and said that
[39:56] he would put enmity
[39:58] between the serpent seed and the woman's
[40:01] seat
[40:02] so when he was speaking from there all
[40:04] the way through in the scripture he
[40:06] began to speak
[40:07] of this one coming right and when we see
[40:10] all the way through the scripture even
[40:11] when moses came and moses spoke
[40:13] people looked at moses and and they saw
[40:16] moses
[40:17] but they didn't see jesus christ they
[40:19] didn't see the fullness
[40:21] but you know that was god speaking to
[40:23] the people here they are
[40:25] here they are building a tabernacle and
[40:27] they're looking behind the holies of
[40:28] holies
[40:29] watching where the high priest went into
[40:31] there and didn't realize that god was on
[40:33] the outside
[40:34] as a pill or a fire as a cloud by day
[40:37] and a pillar of fire by night
[40:39] brother branham said grace gave them a
[40:41] prophet so
[40:42] the prophet was god to them and they
[40:44] didn't realize it right
[40:46] they they had more they had more their
[40:48] eyes upon the sacrifices
[40:50] and and the burnt offerings and the
[40:52] incense and all these other things and
[40:54] missed the
[40:55] miss god just when he came and he spoke
[40:59] to moses upon the mountain and he gave
[41:00] them
[41:01] the ten commandments and they didn't
[41:02] realize that was god trying to
[41:04] communicate with them
[41:05] and you know they just took it as a book
[41:07] of rules
[41:09] and mis and miss that it was god giving
[41:11] grace to them
[41:13] speaking to them and they thought well
[41:15] you know this is
[41:16] well you just whatever god says that's
[41:18] what we're going to do
[41:20] you know what we can't do it if you
[41:23] think you're going to be able to
[41:24] just like they they felt miserably they
[41:26] tried to they thought they could live
[41:27] the life they they thought well we're
[41:28] just going we're just going to burn
[41:30] incense and these
[41:31] and these lambs and all these other
[41:32] things we're going to have these holy
[41:33] convocations and all these other things
[41:35] and you know what they miss god
[41:37] why because they just became rituals
[41:41] people come to church and it just
[41:42] becomes rituals it's come in
[41:44] we're going to stand we're going to sing
[41:45] we're going to pay tithes we're going
[41:46] gonna sit down we're gonna hear somebody
[41:48] speak
[41:48] then we go home and we miss that god
[41:51] speaking to them
[41:56] god's spiel god wants to speak to you
[41:58] god wants to communicate with you
[42:00] he wants to commune with you many times
[42:04] people you know
[42:04] it's it's just you know i i have people
[42:07] that i work with and you
[42:08] and you try to talk to them and the
[42:10] whole problem is they want to do all the
[42:12] talking
[42:14] you know how do you help somebody when
[42:16] they do all the talking if they got a
[42:18] problem if you talk
[42:18] it's like will you be quiet and i'll
[42:19] talk to you a minute
[42:22] sometimes sometimes they talk all you
[42:24] you deal with people and you try to they
[42:26] want to talk to you and it's like well
[42:27] maybe if i could just
[42:28] communicate with you telepathically i'll
[42:30] just send it to you in your mind
[42:32] and then you'll know it well they don't
[42:35] work that way
[42:38] and many times people say well they want
[42:41] to have they want to have a prayer time
[42:42] well
[42:42] they think they're just gonna sit down
[42:44] and talk to god i'm gonna do all the
[42:45] talking no
[42:46] you need to be quiet so god can talk to
[42:48] you
[42:51] you know there's times that that i wake
[42:53] up and as brother dale said many times
[42:55] you know
[42:55] you wake up in the middle of the night
[42:57] early in the morning you know brother
[42:59] brother brown said that was a good time
[43:00] to pray early in the morning you know
[43:02] you and the lord wakes me up sometimes
[43:03] early in the morning and i'm like well i
[43:05] don't know why i'm awake i was like well
[43:06] lord you want to talk to me
[43:09] maybe maybe try and talk to me why
[43:12] because sometimes you get so busy during
[43:14] the day maybe the lord
[43:15] wants to wake you up early tomorrow so
[43:16] he can talk to you
[43:22] sometimes i woke up
[43:26] i got a little brother gave me a little
[43:28] ipod years ago and i
[43:29] have it beside the bed i listened to
[43:30] brother brown well you know there's been
[43:33] times i've woke up in the middle of the
[43:34] night
[43:35] i started listening to brother brandon
[43:36] all of a sudden brother branham says
[43:37] something i got to stop it and rewind
[43:40] it and play it again because i mean all
[43:42] of a sudden it just strikes you
[43:44] something that brother brian says it's
[43:45] like well maybe the lord woke me up
[43:46] because he wanted me to hear that
[43:49] he wants he wants to speak to you and
[43:51] you know maybe maybe it's
[43:52] you know we think you know we're going
[43:54] to hear this audible voice or something
[43:56] maybe it's something god wants us to
[43:58] to look at right he brings a memory of
[44:01] you know a thought to our mind or
[44:02] something we've heard
[44:03] or you know maybe he wants us to look at
[44:05] something you know sometimes you wake up
[44:08] you don't know what to do
[44:09] sometimes you pull out your bible you
[44:10] start reading
[44:12] and all of a sudden something speaks to
[44:14] you well maybe god wants us to do that
[44:17] maybe god's trying to speak to you
[44:20] because you know if you want to get
[44:22] closer to god you read your bible and
[44:24] you pray and you and you commune with
[44:25] god and you allow him time to speak
[44:28] to you you set aside that time that what
[44:31] maybe
[44:31] maybe he'll speak to you right amen
[44:34] you know because i don't know about you
[44:36] but
[44:37] it it it's i would hate to think that i
[44:40] woke up early in the morning and just
[44:42] laid there and not got anything
[44:43] out of that and missing all that sleep
[44:45] amen but i tell you what if i miss some
[44:48] sleep and the lord talks to me that's
[44:49] okay i can handle that
[44:51] i'd miss some sleep to have the lord
[44:53] speak to me
[44:55] you know sometimes you get blessed in
[44:57] the morning and it's like well lord if
[44:58] you give me another blessing like yes
[45:00] just wake me up a little bit earlier
[45:02] exactly i'll take another one of these
[45:06] but you know what because you can make
[45:08] up sleep later on but you know what you
[45:09] can't
[45:10] you nothing compares to having the lord
[45:12] speak to you
[45:15] i want him to speak to me
[45:21] so he said he come to do
[45:24] the will of the lord the will of of god
[45:28] god spoke to him god gave him and he
[45:31] said he
[45:32] and he said and his ministry can take
[45:34] carries on his ke his ministry continues
[45:36] on
[45:36] the ministry of jesus christ continues
[45:38] on today
[45:40] where does that ministry continue at
[45:41] today
[45:43] you know many times people want to know
[45:45] what what the will of god is
[45:47] and you know he said i come to do the
[45:49] will of the father and
[45:51] i didn't have a thought of my own but i
[45:53] listen you know i heard from god and he
[45:54] gave me what
[45:55] he showed me what i needed to do he said
[45:58] you know that
[45:59] that ministry continues on today well
[46:01] you know if he
[46:02] if he was the same back then that he's
[46:04] the same today
[46:05] then if he spoke to if he spoke back
[46:08] then that he speaks today
[46:10] and what is it that he wants us to do
[46:13] because he said he said the same
[46:14] scripture that spoke of the bridegroom
[46:16] speaks of the bride
[46:18] and you know if if he spoke back then
[46:20] and he gave jesus and jesus is our
[46:23] example
[46:24] amen jesus is the one that we're
[46:25] supposed to be following
[46:27] that jesus is the one that is our our
[46:30] example that we should
[46:31] follow and and see that you know why the
[46:34] way he done things is the way we ought
[46:35] to do things
[46:36] and if and if he and if he was that way
[46:38] then we ought to be the exact same way
[46:41] then you know then we should stand up
[46:43] and be able to say that you know
[46:44] it's not it's not me that do these
[46:47] things
[46:48] you know i i don't have a thought of my
[46:50] home but
[46:51] but i do as the father tells me the
[46:53] father leads me
[46:54] and i can do these things and many
[46:56] people say you know what
[46:58] what is the will of god it's the word of
[46:59] god and people you know what is the will
[47:02] for my life
[47:03] what is it that god wants me to do
[47:05] because you know
[47:06] and and you know as jesus came
[47:10] he came to do the will of the father
[47:13] you know what does god want me to do
[47:15] where brother braham says you know he
[47:17] said sometimes we got to get desperate
[47:20] man you know god you know because we
[47:22] don't get desperate enough
[47:24] sometimes we need to get desperate
[47:26] before god to find out what god wants us
[47:28] to do
[47:30] you know brother brandon was speaking in
[47:31] and uh he was speaking
[47:33] in this uh is this the sign of the end
[47:36] in 1962 and your brother brandon was
[47:38] speaking of of trying to
[47:40] understand what god was wanting him to
[47:42] do at this juncture in his ministry
[47:44] and you know and he told sister media he
[47:46] said you know he said i've got to the
[47:48] place now where he said i'm just go out
[47:49] in the desert
[47:50] he said am i going to take any food or
[47:52] water he said but i'm going to stay
[47:53] there till i get an answer from god
[47:55] he said you've got to get desperate with
[47:57] god he said that's the problem we
[48:00] don't get desperate with god we need to
[48:02] get desperate before god
[48:03] he said if you if you you've got to get
[48:06] to the place
[48:07] where you want to know what the will of
[48:08] god is
[48:10] he said and how can you do the will of
[48:12] god if you don't know what the will of
[48:13] god is
[48:15] but you've got to get desperate before
[48:16] god and many people have never got to
[48:18] that place
[48:20] to know what god wants them to do but we
[48:23] can get desperate before god to know
[48:25] what the will of god is what god wants
[48:28] us to do in our lives
[48:30] that we can be just like him because
[48:34] i i want to i want to share with you one
[48:36] thing because when
[48:38] when jesus came and he said i come in
[48:40] the volume of the book
[48:42] that is written of me to do the will of
[48:44] god
[48:45] well you know the same scripture that
[48:47] speaks of you
[48:49] and i spoke of him as the bride where
[48:52] this same thing
[48:52] speaks of him so you know what the the
[48:55] same scripture that speaks of
[48:56] us then you know what there is a volume
[48:58] that's written of you
[49:00] read the same book that's written of him
[49:02] is written of you
[49:03] so when you stand before god you know we
[49:06] can say lo
[49:07] it is written of me although i come in
[49:10] the volume of the book that is written
[49:12] of me
[49:13] to do that i will so here is the will
[49:17] of god that he wants you to do is the
[49:19] word of god if you want to know what god
[49:21] has for your life then you get right in
[49:23] here
[49:24] many people many people have spent all
[49:26] their time you know they're trying to
[49:28] look in
[49:28] other kind of books and and all kinds of
[49:31] other things and trying to find
[49:32] what what the meaning of life is and and
[49:35] you know all these great philosophers
[49:36] have wrote
[49:37] wrote a lot of books and everything and
[49:39] at the end of their life
[49:40] you know you can go back and you look at
[49:41] confucius and all the different
[49:43] philosophers and all the ones
[49:44] that have great monuments built to them
[49:46] and great uh
[49:48] areas of theology wrote to them and
[49:50] everything like that and you know what
[49:51] people don't have any idea i mean all of
[49:54] them said well they're still trying to
[49:55] even in their later parts of their life
[49:57] they were still trying to figure out
[49:59] what the meaning of life was
[50:01] they're still trying to figure out what
[50:02] the great meanings of the universe is
[50:05] and everything
[50:06] but you know there was one that came and
[50:08] he was born over a manure pile
[50:10] in a manger and he came and he said i am
[50:13] the way
[50:14] the truth and the life
[50:17] and he and he and there he stood said
[50:19] here is the son of man
[50:21] that came from heaven that came down
[50:22] from heaven
[50:25] he said search the scriptures
[50:30] and he identified himself as as the one
[50:32] as emmanuel
[50:34] god with us
[50:37] here he come he came down from heaven to
[50:39] fulfill these scriptures
[50:41] and he said he said search the
[50:42] scriptures and see if i'm not fulfilled
[50:45] and filled the word he said because in
[50:47] them you think you have eternal life
[50:50] but he said they are they that testify
[50:52] of me
[50:54] so the word that was written of him is
[50:56] exactly what he fulfilled
[50:59] and so as he was fulfilling the word
[51:01] then thereby
[51:02] you and i have the exact same testimony
[51:05] we should have the same testimony
[51:08] because you know many times people say
[51:09] well you know i'm i'm not
[51:11] at a certain per i'm not at a certain
[51:13] level i'm not a certain person
[51:14] i don't have a certain gift i don't have
[51:16] a certain ministry you know what
[51:18] god called you to a certain place you
[51:21] need to find the place that god called
[51:23] you
[51:24] many people are worried about you know
[51:26] trying to compare themselves to
[51:27] everybody else but do you
[51:29] look in the scripture and search the
[51:31] scripture where you can say
[51:33] lo i come in the volume of the book
[51:38] that whosoever will let him come and
[51:40] deny himself
[51:42] and pick up his cross and follow me he
[51:44] that believeth
[51:45] and is baptized shall be saved
[51:52] he said repent and be baptized every one
[51:55] of you in the name of jesus christ for
[51:57] the remission of sins
[51:59] and you shall receive the gift of the
[52:01] holy ghost
[52:03] and it says and this is unto you and and
[52:06] your children
[52:06] and to them that's a far off even as
[52:09] many as the lord our god shall call
[52:11] so if this was written then then then
[52:13] when i walk out there and i say you know
[52:15] what
[52:15] i believe that and you know what then i
[52:18] then i repent of my sins and you know
[52:19] what i'm walking in the volume of the
[52:21] book that was written of me
[52:23] amen then that's the that's the volume
[52:25] of the book that's written of me
[52:27] one because that's what it says
[52:29] whosoever will let him come
[52:32] well then you know what he said put your
[52:33] name in there well if that's if that was
[52:35] you
[52:36] then you know what when i walk up there
[52:37] and i got in the water one day then you
[52:39] know what
[52:39] that was the one that was the word that
[52:41] was written of me that's what was
[52:43] written to me
[52:43] that's what god wrote to me i don't know
[52:45] about anybody else but that's what he
[52:47] wrote to me
[52:50] when he when he said to go into when you
[52:52] repent and be baptized in the name of
[52:54] jesus christ he said you
[52:56] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[52:59] well then you know what if you
[53:01] if you've truly repented then you know
[53:03] what god's obligated to give you the
[53:05] holy ghost
[53:08] why because if you he that believeth so
[53:12] you must continue in the word
[53:14] amen he that continue in the word is my
[53:17] disciple indeed
[53:18] amen he said ye shall know the truth
[53:22] and the truth shall set you free right
[53:24] so the thing is is so we went through
[53:27] the the oracles of god and we follow the
[53:29] ordinances
[53:30] but you know he said if you continue in
[53:32] them so what you're saying in the volume
[53:34] of the book
[53:35] that was written of you
[53:38] so then then we're right here in the
[53:40] scripture so when we're reading this
[53:42] scripture
[53:42] we're not talking about peter and paul
[53:44] and james and john and moses
[53:46] and all the rest of them why because
[53:47] when we start reading this book like
[53:49] we're supposed to
[53:50] because you know what god will give you
[53:52] these holy ghost glasses
[53:53] that he'll change your eyesight where
[53:54] you can see supernatural things
[53:56] and when you start reading in the
[53:57] scripture you know what we're not
[53:59] reading about paul and james and john
[54:01] and all the rest of them why because you
[54:02] start to see jesus christ
[54:04] and you start to see jesus christ in you
[54:08] why because the word that was written of
[54:10] jesus christ is written of me
[54:15] well because you know the scripture says
[54:17] we've been made more than conquerors
[54:18] through him
[54:19] that loved us
[54:23] glory amen then if i'm i'm more than a
[54:25] conqueror
[54:26] than all the other things if if i'm an
[54:28] heir of the father
[54:29] and i'm joined with jesus christ all the
[54:31] things that were written in the
[54:32] scripture of jesus right
[54:34] is written of me
[54:45] then i know what god has given me
[54:50] he has given me exactly what i have need
[54:52] of
[54:54] brother branham
[54:58] speaking this is this is to take on the
[55:00] whole armor of god
[55:02] brother brown says and so now god
[55:04] knowing at the last days
[55:06] there will come intellectual giants
[55:08] there will come
[55:09] everything intellectual all kinds of the
[55:11] enemy
[55:12] with reasoning powers to try to prove to
[55:14] the church
[55:15] that the days of miracles is passing and
[55:18] all this god packed in the baptism
[55:20] of the holy ghost with what speaking
[55:22] with tongues interpretation of tongues
[55:23] prophecies gifts
[55:24] and all kinds of things they may seem
[55:27] hard in training but brother on the
[55:28] battlefront
[55:29] every one of them's got to be used god
[55:32] equips his
[55:32] soldiers exactly what it takes to use
[55:36] amen right they say oh just learn
[55:39] psychology that won't work no sir
[55:44] he said they say that's no good he said
[55:48] that yeah that's as thin
[55:49] as the broth made out of a shadow of a
[55:50] chicken that starved to death so
[55:52] that's no good we have to have the power
[55:54] of the holy ghost coming upon
[55:56] a man with all nine spiritual gifts
[55:58] dwelling in him
[55:59] all you say i just don't like to get out
[56:02] i don't like to pray all night
[56:04] well then you're going to get killed out
[56:06] there on the battlefront
[56:08] he said you stay there till god equips
[56:09] you with the baptism of
[56:11] of the spirit then everything that you
[56:14] that you've got need of
[56:15] in this world in the world to come lives
[56:17] right in you
[56:18] the all-wise god know how to equip his
[56:21] army he equipped it with the baptism of
[56:23] the holy ghost that's exactly what
[56:25] he sent for these last days he knew that
[56:28] we'd have to have it he knew that the
[56:30] people would reason would go to
[56:31] reasoning
[56:32] this word when it come in print out here
[56:35] what would happen and today we find the
[56:37] people
[56:37] saying well where is that god of history
[56:41] where is that god that crossed the red
[56:43] sea where is that god that healed the
[56:45] sick
[56:46] see they tried to go back
[56:49] and he said what good does it do to give
[56:52] your canary bird vitamins and take
[56:54] him give him have good strong wings
[56:58] and keep them in a cage that's what they
[57:00] try to do with the people feed them all
[57:02] kinds of vitamins of this and that and
[57:03] the other
[57:04] and the first thing you know tell them
[57:05] all the days of miracles has passed
[57:08] you've pinned them up in some little
[57:10] thing down here it's a lie christ
[57:12] is the same yesterday today and forever
[57:14] god knowed it would take the baptism of
[57:16] the holy ghost to prove
[57:17] his latter day signs that's right
[57:23] many people you know because nowadays
[57:25] that's that's the that's the exact where
[57:27] the land that we're living in
[57:29] you know you talk about the children of
[57:31] israel going into that land
[57:32] and you know when the when the spies
[57:34] went in and they saw the land and they
[57:36] knew what it looked like
[57:37] because it was exactly what god promised
[57:39] them in the land but you know
[57:40] everybody could see the giants that were
[57:42] standing in the land and you know they
[57:44] said well you know
[57:44] we just look like grasshoppers in their
[57:46] sight you know because they're so big
[57:48] and you know there's many people that
[57:49] come up with that same mentality today
[57:51] because you know they walked in the
[57:53] message and they've talked the message
[57:54] and they've read the message
[57:55] and you know and they've done all these
[57:57] things but you know what they're still
[57:58] standing in the land of these
[57:59] intellectual giants
[58:01] and you know there's and it's still the
[58:02] way that that same way today
[58:04] but you know what it doesn't matter how
[58:06] big it is and how scary it looks or
[58:08] whatever
[58:08] you know the devil is a liar and he's
[58:10] always been a liar he always will be a
[58:12] liar but let me tell you something
[58:13] brother jesus christ is the truth and
[58:16] this message is the truth and if you
[58:17] receive a
[58:18] revelation of it it doesn't matter how
[58:20] many wins blow
[58:21] it doesn't matter how many doctrines
[58:23] come or whatever devils come
[58:25] before it you know there's one thing
[58:26] about it he said that he would put
[58:28] serpents and scorpions and all the
[58:30] powers of the enemy under our feet
[58:32] and we would walk over all these things
[58:34] and and none of these things would hurt
[58:36] us
[58:36] well you know what the devil's going to
[58:38] try you on that but let me tell you
[58:39] something
[58:40] the same the same one that spoke and he
[58:42] said
[58:43] he said the president of this world has
[58:45] come and he's got
[58:46] no power in me he's got no hold on me
[58:48] he's the same one that spoke
[58:50] and it's the same word that speaks of
[58:51] you well because if you
[58:53] can get a hold of jesus christ and
[58:55] surrender yourself
[58:56] because he said it's not by education
[58:58] it's not going to be about learning but
[58:59] it's by a surrendered life
[59:01] if you can surrender yourself before god
[59:03] and allow the holy ghost to work
[59:05] you know what he has no hold on you amen
[59:11] you know because the devil you know he
[59:13] he's going to try he knows exactly how
[59:15] to
[59:15] attack you he knows what works in your
[59:18] in your area he knows what
[59:19] what what you have problems with right
[59:23] right he knows what each one of us face
[59:30] you've been he's been battling man for
[59:33] many many years
[59:35] thousands of years he knows all about
[59:36] man he knows everybody's weaknesses
[59:40] right he knows what punch he's got
[59:41] coming towards you
[59:43] he knows everything that you that you
[59:45] know he know he knows you
[59:48] as as brother biscuit said the grab bag
[59:51] of life
[59:51] you know each one of us were born a
[59:53] certain way and we all have
[59:55] uh you know we all have complexes and
[59:58] and we all have different personalities
[1:00:00] and we all have different things that we
[1:00:01] have to overcome and deal with
[1:00:03] and it's just it's just the grab bag of
[1:00:04] life everybody has something different
[1:00:06] but you know what god has a way to over
[1:00:09] to bring you through those things
[1:00:11] for you to overcome through those things
[1:00:13] and the devil knows how to work at you
[1:00:14] he knows how to
[1:00:16] needle you he knows how to frustrate you
[1:00:18] he knows how to come at you
[1:00:19] but you know what god give us the power
[1:00:24] brother branham said you know when he
[1:00:25] when he spoke of giving his in
[1:00:28] his army the holy ghost brother brahm
[1:00:30] said you know he knew what to equip his
[1:00:32] army with and he said what did he quit
[1:00:34] his army with
[1:00:35] not only the holy ghost he said but he
[1:00:37] equipped his army with the word
[1:00:39] he said one because he knew that this
[1:00:41] army was in the last days
[1:00:42] would need the word he give this army
[1:00:45] the word
[1:00:45] we are anointed and we are equipped with
[1:00:48] the holy ghost and the word
[1:00:51] thank you lord and you know what it
[1:00:54] takes both
[1:00:55] one because many people want to live
[1:00:56] want to live and this and they just
[1:00:58] they just want to you know just live in
[1:01:00] the spirit and they want to they just
[1:01:02] want but you know what it takes the word
[1:01:03] too
[1:01:05] and so many people you know they just
[1:01:06] hold to the word and it's just word and
[1:01:08] there's no spirit there's no life
[1:01:10] there why because the spirit without the
[1:01:12] spirit the letter killeth
[1:01:15] it takes both of them but you know what
[1:01:17] we have been equipped
[1:01:18] with the holy ghost and we have been
[1:01:21] equipped with the word god give us the
[1:01:22] word
[1:01:23] that we can overcome and so here we are
[1:01:25] standing here we have what we have ne
[1:01:27] we've
[1:01:28] and he said whatever you this army has
[1:01:30] been given
[1:01:31] everything it has need of in this world
[1:01:33] in the world to come
[1:01:38] he knows what conflicts that you're
[1:01:39] going to face
[1:01:44] before you ever went out on the
[1:01:46] battlefield
[1:01:48] before you ever had to go face this
[1:01:50] conflict
[1:01:52] and you know what he just didn't give
[1:01:54] you something
[1:01:55] and said here you do it right he didn't
[1:01:59] he didn't just give it to you
[1:02:01] brother branham said that he took the
[1:02:03] exact same thing
[1:02:05] when jesus was standing here he said he
[1:02:07] wanted to show you that it would work
[1:02:09] and so when satan come to tempt him
[1:02:11] he didn't do something miracle or
[1:02:13] anything like he went right to the word
[1:02:15] to show
[1:02:16] that he could put the devil in his place
[1:02:19] and he said it's the same thing with you
[1:02:21] and i we have been given the word that
[1:02:22] we can put the devil in his place that
[1:02:24] we can
[1:02:25] back him up well because we can be
[1:02:28] fortified behind the word that he can't
[1:02:30] get us
[1:02:31] right that we can destroy all the powers
[1:02:34] of the enemy
[1:02:36] put him where you where he can't get to
[1:02:38] us
[1:02:40] but you know the thing is you you have
[1:02:42] to be the one to do that you have to get
[1:02:45] fortified behind the words
[1:02:46] but you know you can realize that that
[1:02:48] you have been given the word
[1:02:51] and understand that when he said lo i
[1:02:54] come and the volume of the book
[1:02:55] you know it's it's the same thing
[1:02:58] not that you know that brother dale's
[1:03:00] going to be the one to to speak
[1:03:02] the word or do these things or brother
[1:03:03] wade or somebody else is going to do you
[1:03:05] know what
[1:03:05] you're going to be the one to do
[1:03:09] when all the powers of hell when every
[1:03:12] with everything the whole foundation of
[1:03:14] hell shakes
[1:03:15] when the weakest christian gets on their
[1:03:17] knees and starts to pray through
[1:03:18] why that's the reason god don't want you
[1:03:21] praying that's the reason god don't want
[1:03:22] you seeking him that's the reason god
[1:03:24] don't want you in the word
[1:03:26] why because he wants to keep you bound
[1:03:30] i'm sorry satan thank you hey don't tame
[1:03:34] me for what i say but for what i mean
[1:03:35] there you go
[1:03:39] i know that's the devil trying to fight
[1:03:41] against me there
[1:03:44] but that's what but that's what satan is
[1:03:45] going to try to hold you back
[1:03:47] amen amen satan is going to try to stop
[1:03:51] you from communicating
[1:03:53] amen you know people people
[1:03:56] you know they you know the people get
[1:03:59] they think they get blessed with things
[1:04:02] and you know people people want people
[1:04:04] want to go through the life and and they
[1:04:05] want to do certain things and
[1:04:07] and they think well you know if i if i
[1:04:08] can just reach this this one spot
[1:04:11] or they can if i can just do this one
[1:04:13] thing
[1:04:14] you know they were they were searching
[1:04:16] to reach this
[1:04:17] apex and you know the thing is is maybe
[1:04:20] god don't want you to have that
[1:04:21] maybe god don't want you to go down that
[1:04:23] road god don't want you
[1:04:25] going through these things but you know
[1:04:27] people people they they're so worked up
[1:04:29] on trying to
[1:04:30] trying to achieve something
[1:04:33] you know maybe you need to stop and
[1:04:34] think and and it's so interesting how
[1:04:36] some people
[1:04:37] are the ones that that can tell you how
[1:04:39] you need to live your life and
[1:04:40] god has they have your answer for their
[1:04:42] for your life but they ain't got an
[1:04:44] answer for their own
[1:04:49] they blow around like like a leaf in the
[1:04:52] wind but you know what they got dust
[1:04:53] seth the lord for everybody else
[1:04:58] well you know what you know i i look at
[1:05:00] some people like that and you know i was
[1:05:01] like
[1:05:02] that would be the last person i won't
[1:05:03] talk to that's the last person i don't
[1:05:06] get
[1:05:06] any kind of information it's like
[1:05:09] whatever you tell me i guess i'll do the
[1:05:11] opposite
[1:05:12] yeah but you know people people get so
[1:05:15] robbed but you know
[1:05:16] if you want to if you want to know what
[1:05:18] god wants in your life then you know
[1:05:19] what you need to pray
[1:05:23] because you know everybody everybody
[1:05:24] wants to have thus saith the lord and
[1:05:26] they
[1:05:27] and and it's so funny people people are
[1:05:29] trying to achieve
[1:05:30] something and every time every time you
[1:05:32] turn around it falls apart
[1:05:36] and you know we we we struggle with
[1:05:38] things in our lives and it's like
[1:05:40] well i want to do this one thing and i
[1:05:41] struggle at it and i struggle at it and
[1:05:43] you know what it don't work you know why
[1:05:44] because maybe god don't want you to do
[1:05:47] that bro
[1:05:50] and sometimes it's like you know it's
[1:05:51] the best thing ever happened is not to
[1:05:52] do that
[1:05:55] there's there's people you know they
[1:05:57] spend all their time you know
[1:05:59] working and they want they want to
[1:06:02] uh you know they want to make all this
[1:06:04] money and everything and
[1:06:07] hey i'm i'm going to tell a little
[1:06:08] something uh i was listening to brother
[1:06:10] matthew bray the other day
[1:06:12] and he was up preaching he said i don't
[1:06:14] need another hundred thousand dollars in

[1:06:41] get like that you know it's it's the
[1:06:42] hundred thousand it's the million
[1:06:44] you know they're looking for something
[1:06:46] else you know they're looking for the
[1:06:47] next golden opportunity
[1:06:49] and you know what they're missing
[1:06:50] they're missing the whole golden
[1:06:52] opportunity in their life
[1:06:53] is because this is where it's at
[1:06:58] people people struggle for all these
[1:07:01] different things
[1:07:02] and you know why why struggle for these
[1:07:03] things when you know all these things

[1:08:26] the house
[1:08:27] he said it's so dusty he said it don't
[1:08:29] even run
[1:08:31] but he said for years all i had in my
[1:08:34] life was that sports car
[1:08:35] a sports car and he said you know what
[1:08:39] what is it now
[1:08:43] people spend all our time trying to get
[1:08:44] an education
[1:08:47] people struggle and strive to get doctor
[1:08:50] in front of their name
[1:08:52] there's a lady was reading an article
[1:08:53] about some time back this lady she
[1:08:55] struggled all she wanted to be was a
[1:08:56] medical doctor she spent all of her life
[1:08:58] studying she didn't have the money
[1:09:01] she graduated she's a medical doctor she
[1:09:04] goes a million dollars in student loans
[1:09:10] here's a lady that spent all her life
[1:09:12] studying
[1:09:14] since high school that's all she's ever
[1:09:15] wanted to do is have md
[1:09:17] by her name md they said trying to pay
[1:09:21] off a million dollars
[1:09:22] of student loans at the current rate
[1:09:26] they said she will spend the rest of her
[1:09:28] working career
[1:09:29] trying to pay off that million dollars
[1:09:33] because you know what they don't give
[1:09:34] you that million dollars
[1:09:37] but they're like man if bernie sanders
[1:09:39] could get in there they could just
[1:09:41] wipe all that dead away
[1:09:46] yes okay well you know that's what
[1:09:48] bernie said
[1:09:49] he got up there and he was all all those
[1:09:51] college campuses bernie's up here so we
[1:09:52] need to wipe away all this debt
[1:09:56] and they're like yeah
[1:10:00] there was a there was a they had this uh
[1:10:03] article they were they were interviewing
[1:10:05] all these college students and they
[1:10:06] think that's a great idea yes
[1:10:07] well let's get rid of all this debt it's
[1:10:09] beautiful wonderful excellent
[1:10:12] and then so they said well here's an
[1:10:13] idea we come up with a great idea and we
[1:10:15] want to show y'all
[1:10:16] share this with you they went around and
[1:10:18] they found all these college students
[1:10:20] that agreed with that idea
[1:10:22] and they said who's paying for your
[1:10:24] education oh my scholarships or my
[1:10:26] parents are paying for it i owe
[1:10:28] nothing sitting here with nothing i'm
[1:10:30] going to graduate i'm not going to owe a
[1:10:31] dime
[1:10:33] but they think that we ought to give
[1:10:35] away all this education free all these
[1:10:37] other people
[1:10:38] turned around and said well we have this
[1:10:40] we have this opportunity for all of you
[1:10:42] that don't know anything we think all of
[1:10:44] you should
[1:10:45] should pony up uh ten thousand dollars
[1:10:48] and they're standing there with their
[1:10:49] friends who owe thirty forty thousand
[1:10:52] dollars in college debt and so we think
[1:10:53] you ought to give ten thousand dollars
[1:10:55] to them
[1:10:55] and they're like no way
[1:11:00] it's like well who do you think that
[1:11:01] that this trillion dollars that's owed
[1:11:04] who do you think's paying for that
[1:11:08] all the taxpayers are paying for that
[1:11:13] and they you know it's so funny people
[1:11:14] people don't realize that the debt
[1:11:16] that somebody owes somebody's paying on
[1:11:18] all that it's not just free
[1:11:22] and when you go to work you know what
[1:11:24] you're gonna start paying taxes
[1:11:25] and you're gonna start carrying that
[1:11:27] load
[1:11:29] and your grandkids and everybody else
[1:11:30] will
[1:11:34] and everybody thought well that's a
[1:11:35] great idea and until they find out
[1:11:37] exactly who owes it
[1:11:40] well you know it's it's the same thing
[1:11:42] everybody thinks boy you know they come
[1:11:43] up with some great idea and you know
[1:11:44] what the devil's got a good picture
[1:11:46] the devil's got a good plan he was going
[1:11:48] to show you this great picture but you
[1:11:49] know what
[1:11:50] you don't know exactly what you're going
[1:11:51] to pay for it
[1:11:54] what what what will you give the bible
[1:11:57] says what will a man give in exchange
[1:11:59] for his soul
[1:12:01] what prophet if a man he said if he if
[1:12:03] he gains the whole world
[1:12:06] and he loses his own soul
[1:12:09] you know the other day i was thinking
[1:12:10] about that and i was i was listening to
[1:12:12] one of brother luis's uh podcast and you
[1:12:14] know that come to me you know it says
[1:12:16] what would a man
[1:12:17] gain if if he if he gained the whole
[1:12:20] world
[1:12:20] and he loses his own soul brother
[1:12:22] branham says your soul's worth
[1:12:24] ten thousand worlds so you'd only gain
[1:12:27] one
[1:12:29] yeah so what would what would happen if
[1:12:31] you oh if you owed so if you owned a ten
[1:12:32] thousand dollar rolex and so
[1:12:34] and so somebody sold it or you know
[1:12:35] bought it from you for a dollar
[1:12:39] well you know i wouldn't do that for
[1:12:41] nothing under the sun
[1:12:44] or you know if you had if you had a ten
[1:12:46] thousand dollar gun collection would you
[1:12:48] would you sell it for a dollar or a ten
[1:12:51] thousand dollar car
[1:12:52] or if you had a hundred thousand dollar
[1:12:54] car or a you know five hundred thousand
[1:12:56] dollar home would you sell it for just
[1:12:58] you know 500 bucks or a thousand dollars
[1:13:00] or whatever
[1:13:02] well i wouldn't do that
[1:13:05] but you know what when they start
[1:13:06] thinking about their soul and eternal
[1:13:08] life and
[1:13:09] being eternally separated from god you
[1:13:11] know what are you going to what do you
[1:13:12] give in exchange for your soul
[1:13:14] what are you going to give in exchange
[1:13:16] for your life
[1:13:18] and people and people say oh you know i
[1:13:20] want to i want to do this and i want to
[1:13:22] do that and you know
[1:13:24] all these all these great lofty goals
[1:13:25] and everything like that but you know
[1:13:27] what if you've not become
[1:13:28] a son or daughter of jesus christ if
[1:13:30] you've not become a son
[1:13:32] or daughter of god if you've not given
[1:13:33] your soul to god
[1:13:35] if you've not become born again you know
[1:13:36] what it doesn't mean anything
[1:13:38] it doesn't matter you know you can you
[1:13:40] can do the greatest things in the world
[1:13:42] but you know what when you stand at the
[1:13:43] day of judgment it doesn't really count
[1:13:45] for anything
[1:13:46] but you know what you know i'm so glad
[1:13:48] that i that i have made
[1:13:50] the greatest investment that i can make
[1:13:52] and that that is investing in jesus
[1:13:54] christ why because
[1:13:55] he invested in me he gave all for me
[1:13:59] now i'm going to give my all to him i
[1:14:01] want i want to give my all to him
[1:14:03] i want to be all that he wants me to be
[1:14:06] i want to give my all to him that i can
[1:14:08] be exactly what he'd have me to be
[1:14:11] i don't want to have any of my own ideas
[1:14:13] i don't want to have any of
[1:14:14] my own feelings or thoughts or anything
[1:14:17] i want to be what god has
[1:14:18] for me i want him i want people to see
[1:14:20] him and me
[1:14:21] i want to be because if he said that he
[1:14:24] come
[1:14:25] to fulfill the book that to come in the
[1:14:27] volume of this book
[1:14:28] to do the will of god then that's what i
[1:14:30] want to do i want to walk in the volume
[1:14:32] of the book i want to know it from
[1:14:34] genesis to revelation i want to go
[1:14:36] through there and i don't want to just
[1:14:38] read about somebody else's exploits
[1:14:40] i want to see myself in there i want to
[1:14:42] find myself
[1:14:43] in the word i want to find myself
[1:14:46] because that's what jesus came to do
[1:14:48] he stood there and he picked up the book
[1:14:49] of isaiah and he read and he said this
[1:14:51] day
[1:14:52] this scripture is fulfilled well you
[1:14:54] know what that is what
[1:14:55] you and i have been given that's our
[1:14:57] commission in this date is to stand up
[1:14:59] and say
[1:14:59] this day this scripture is fulfilled why
[1:15:02] because you know and we're still
[1:15:03] fulfilling that scripture but you know
[1:15:05] what there's a great day coming and god
[1:15:07] has given us the commission to take a
[1:15:08] body change
[1:15:09] and you know what somebody is to take
[1:15:11] that body change that somebody's been
[1:15:13] given the commission to do that
[1:15:16] you have been anointed you have been
[1:15:18] equipped you have been given the word
[1:15:21] you have been given the holy ghost to do
[1:15:23] that
[1:15:24] one because the last enemy that is to be
[1:15:27] conquered
[1:15:27] is death why because many people have
[1:15:31] we've
[1:15:31] we've seen how he's taken all these ones
[1:15:34] down and he's
[1:15:35] you know he's conquered these one and
[1:15:37] all these ones are going down but you
[1:15:38] know what
[1:15:39] they have fought their battle they have
[1:15:41] they have fought to
[1:15:42] run the race fought the battle run their
[1:15:44] course that has come to us
[1:15:46] because when they done their portion
[1:15:48] then they went on then they're in their
[1:15:50] reward then you know it's been given to
[1:15:51] us
[1:15:52] to take the baton and run the race
[1:15:58] as paul said we see this great cloud of
[1:16:02] witnesses
[1:16:03] let us run this race one because that's
[1:16:06] what god give us
[1:16:07] he he called us to this and people say
[1:16:10] well you know i don't know if i can do
[1:16:13] this or not
[1:16:14] well let me tell you something brother
[1:16:15] god called you to do it
[1:16:17] right god give you this this
[1:16:23] because your brother brim says in the
[1:16:25] message thirst
[1:16:27] he said how many times i meet people
[1:16:31] that's prone to be a little nervous when
[1:16:32] they we find out that
[1:16:34] they're trying to do something and
[1:16:35] everything is just blocking it off
[1:16:37] on both sides they say he said it might
[1:16:39] not be the will of the lord see
[1:16:40] now don't let the devil lie to you like
[1:16:42] that he said the first thing is to find
[1:16:44] out whether it's the will of god or not
[1:16:46] then if you want to know whether it's
[1:16:48] the will of god look into the bible
[1:16:50] there it is that that sets you straight
[1:16:52] it's the word of god and then if you see
[1:16:54] it's in the word of god for you to do it
[1:16:57] like for instance seeking for the
[1:16:58] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:17:00] many times i've run into people and say
[1:17:02] well i've sold for the holy ghost and i
[1:17:04] just couldn't receive it
[1:17:05] i don't believe it's for me every time i
[1:17:07] get down i get sick
[1:17:08] i go to pray and if i fast i get sick
[1:17:11] and if i try to stay all night i stay up
[1:17:13] and get so sleepy
[1:17:14] i can't get off my feet remember that is
[1:17:16] the devil amen
[1:17:18] because god intends for you to have the
[1:17:19] holy ghost it's for whosoever will
[1:17:22] all right amen
[1:17:25] you know many times people people you
[1:17:27] know they say well i don't know if it's
[1:17:28] the will of god or not we're going to
[1:17:29] get in the word and find out if it's for
[1:17:31] the will of
[1:17:32] it's the will of god for you or not
[1:17:35] people
[1:17:36] you know they're worried about how
[1:17:37] things are going to go but
[1:17:40] you know what you get in the scripture
[1:17:43] and if god
[1:17:44] give it to one person then he's
[1:17:45] obligated to give it to you
[1:17:48] he said if you meet if you if you have
[1:17:50] the right mental attitude and you meet
[1:17:52] the same
[1:17:53] same standards the same obligations that
[1:17:55] thing but then god's obligated to meet
[1:17:57] your need to give you exactly what you
[1:17:59] have need of
[1:18:00] to meet just like he did somebody else
[1:18:02] because he's not a respecter of persons
[1:18:09] brother and this is from power of
[1:18:11] transformation brother braham says
[1:18:13] he said in romans a very very familiar
[1:18:15] chapter he said
[1:18:16] i have a few verses here
[1:18:19] and he's speaking
[1:18:24] he said i beseech you therefore brethren
[1:18:25] by the mercies of god that you present
[1:18:26] yourselves
[1:18:27] a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto
[1:18:29] god which is your reasonable service
[1:18:31] he said i thought that was so beautiful
[1:18:33] for this group this morning he said what
[1:18:34] have you
[1:18:35] you done did you know and it's a
[1:18:38] conjunction i understand
[1:18:40] he said but be not conformed to this
[1:18:41] world but be
[1:18:43] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:18:44] that you may prove what is that good and
[1:18:47] acceptable and perfect will of god
[1:18:49] that's what we all want to do is be not
[1:18:52] conformed to this
[1:18:54] world but be transformed by the renewing
[1:18:56] of our mind
[1:18:58] to do the perfect and acceptable will of
[1:19:00] god now
[1:19:01] that we have been saved as we are then
[1:19:05] that we have been filled with the holy
[1:19:08] spirit as we have
[1:19:09] now we want to we want the mind
[1:19:12] that was in christ to be in us that we
[1:19:15] might be transformed from the natural
[1:19:17] things of life
[1:19:18] and be brought in to be in to do
[1:19:21] the perfect will of god by
[1:19:23] transformation
[1:19:24] of god's spirit by his word
[1:19:31] and this is from i want to read one more
[1:19:33] quote this is from the from the
[1:19:34] masterpiece and brother brown
[1:19:36] says he says and he's speaking of
[1:19:39] of of adam in the in the second adam
[1:19:43] and he says and now for nearly two
[1:19:45] thousand years god
[1:19:46] has been again making him a masterpiece
[1:19:49] he said because he struck
[1:19:51] adam a piece off of him part of him a
[1:19:53] rib to make a wife for him
[1:19:55] and now that perfect masterpiece that he
[1:19:57] struck
[1:19:58] at calvary he got a piece off of him
[1:20:01] it's just the new testament that's all
[1:20:04] he fulfilled the old testament
[1:20:06] now it's the new testament another piece
[1:20:08] to be fulfilled see
[1:20:11] the new and old is husband and wife and
[1:20:14] it's taking the new
[1:20:15] the old to foreshadow the new christ
[1:20:18] come the masterpiece
[1:20:19] to fulfill that now his bride will
[1:20:22] fulfill everything
[1:20:23] that's in the new testament another
[1:20:26] masterpiece
[1:20:27] in the making amen so if
[1:20:31] whatever he done is exactly what we done
[1:20:34] is is our commission and that's what
[1:20:36] he's equipped you to do
[1:20:42] so if
[1:20:45] he died and shed his blood
[1:20:51] you know brother brother brahm said if i
[1:20:53] could if i could hold a charger
[1:20:55] that held the blood of jesus christ
[1:20:59] he said how precious that blood would be
[1:21:01] that i would hold that blood and he said
[1:21:03] how careful i would be with that blood
[1:21:05] that i would hold it but he said you
[1:21:07] know what he said i stand
[1:21:09] in front of the purchased of that blood
[1:21:12] and he said he said how precious are you
[1:21:15] that if that if we look at
[1:21:16] if we look at calvary and we see that
[1:21:18] blood that was shed and we
[1:21:20] and we think of the blood of what what
[1:21:22] he went through for you and i
[1:21:23] and you know what you are the ones that
[1:21:25] he done that for
[1:21:26] that he became sin that he became the
[1:21:29] lowest of the low that you can become
[1:21:31] greater than
[1:21:32] than you can imagine in your in your
[1:21:33] mind but because
[1:21:35] he said he said it's not entered into
[1:21:37] the mind of man into the heart of man
[1:21:39] what god
[1:21:40] has in store for them that love him why
[1:21:42] because you know
[1:21:43] he has brought us to this place well if
[1:21:45] the scripture speaks of him
[1:21:47] and we and we rise up and we think about
[1:21:49] how wonderful he
[1:21:50] is and and how holy he is and how
[1:21:53] and how glorious he is and all the
[1:21:55] things that all the adjectives that we
[1:21:57] can put before god and we think about
[1:21:59] what god
[1:21:59] is and what the greatness of god and you
[1:22:02] know there's not even words in the human
[1:22:04] tongue
[1:22:04] or any language in the world that can
[1:22:06] express who god is
[1:22:07] and his greatness and and all the
[1:22:09] adjectives that you could describe about
[1:22:11] god well you know what
[1:22:12] brothers and sisters you and i are the
[1:22:14] same one why because we are
[1:22:16] he said we're born of bone and we're
[1:22:18] flesh of his flesh and we're spirit of
[1:22:20] his spirit
[1:22:20] and we're word of his word well if it
[1:22:22] speaks of him then how great
[1:22:24] are you and i why because that's not
[1:22:26] what we make in ourselves but it's
[1:22:27] because you are the apple of his eye you
[1:22:30] are his vision
[1:22:32] you are his vision of what he wants and
[1:22:34] you know what
[1:22:35] he died that he could bring us this this
[1:22:38] to close this chasm for you and i to
[1:22:40] become
[1:22:40] just like him that we could be him made
[1:22:43] made flesh in this world
[1:22:44] that you know what he came and he said
[1:22:47] he said did i go away to prepare a place
[1:22:49] for you
[1:22:49] he said i came and i died for you and
[1:22:52] again i really done exactly
[1:22:54] all that i could do for you but he said
[1:22:56] i go away
[1:22:57] but he said you know what he said just
[1:22:59] in a few days i'm coming back
[1:23:01] and he said he said i must go away that
[1:23:03] he the hum comforter can come
[1:23:05] and he said he'll lead you and guide you
[1:23:06] into all truth and you know what you and
[1:23:08] i are that today
[1:23:09] walking in flesh to show the world who
[1:23:11] jesus christ is
[1:23:13] and you know what he's coming back for a
[1:23:15] bride that's going to be spotless that's
[1:23:17] going to be perfect without
[1:23:18] wrinkle or blemish or anything that's
[1:23:21] who you and i
[1:23:22] are well because god brought us to this
[1:23:24] place
[1:23:28] you think you know what what am i
[1:23:29] supposed to do walk in the volume of the
[1:23:31] book that's written of you
[1:23:33] one because everything that he wrote in
[1:23:35] this book
[1:23:36] is right about you
[1:23:41] man when you when you read about the all
[1:23:43] the all the characters in the scripture
[1:23:45] and realize all these examples were
[1:23:47] given to you
[1:23:49] to express you amen
[1:23:55] man it's beautiful amen god wants you to
[1:23:58] look in that scripture and find yourself
[1:24:02] he said find yourself in those bible
[1:24:04] characters
[1:24:05] when you when you see when you see
[1:24:07] esther as
[1:24:08] as by the way he's been preaching about
[1:24:10] when you see esther and all the things
[1:24:11] that she had to go through
[1:24:13] but you know what god wants you to be
[1:24:15] just like this
[1:24:17] you know god has a place for you to come
[1:24:20] and you enter in
[1:24:24] man god has work for you to do
[1:24:30] god wants you to be just like that all
[1:24:32] the way through the scripture all the
[1:24:33] different
[1:24:34] the types and the shadows that are there
[1:24:36] that speak of you and i
[1:24:38] yeah you know many times like brother
[1:24:40] ram said we live so far below our
[1:24:42] privileges
[1:24:43] we don't we don't realize what what god
[1:24:46] how god sees us
[1:24:47] we spend our time looking at ourselves
[1:24:49] in the mirror
[1:24:51] and we look at we look at ourselves and
[1:24:52] we down on ourselves
[1:24:54] and you know we get all these type
[1:24:55] things well you know what if you've got
[1:24:56] a problem the place to go
[1:24:58] is to calvary we need to we need to get
[1:25:01] under the shed blood we need to find
[1:25:03] ourselves in the word
[1:25:05] amen why because if if i
[1:25:09] you know because he said if if there's
[1:25:12] something wrong
[1:25:14] then you know what we can be covered by
[1:25:17] the blood
[1:25:17] glory a child is chastened of the lord
[1:25:23] he said if we should if we judge
[1:25:24] ourselves
[1:25:26] he said we're chasing to the lord that
[1:25:29] we won't be condemned with the world
[1:25:31] that's right you know what you're always
[1:25:34] going to have problems you're always
[1:25:35] going to
[1:25:36] you're always going to have trials
[1:25:37] you're always going to fail
[1:25:39] but you know what there's a time to get
[1:25:41] past all of that
[1:25:43] that's the reason paul said forgetting
[1:25:44] all those things in the past
[1:25:47] you know you can't do nothing riding
[1:25:49] looking in the rearview mirror
[1:25:51] you always time looking back and
[1:25:52] worrying about things in the past
[1:25:56] you know what because you you've got to
[1:25:58] get to a place where you get a
[1:25:59] revelation that you know what it's under
[1:26:01] it's in the sea of god's forgetfulness
[1:26:03] god don't remember it you don't need to
[1:26:05] be remembered
[1:26:08] why do you you know people let the devil
[1:26:10] just beat everybody
[1:26:11] beat you up you know it's like that that
[1:26:14] lady that i work with you know she gets
[1:26:15] so worked up over everything it's in the
[1:26:17] past and
[1:26:18] you know and she just she worries and
[1:26:19] frets over everything and i told kathy i
[1:26:21] said if you've prayed to god and god
[1:26:23] forgive you then why are you keep
[1:26:24] worrying about it because
[1:26:25] god said he don't remember it anymore
[1:26:29] if you if god if god forgive you and
[1:26:31] forgot it then why don't you forget it
[1:26:34] but you know that's the devil that devil
[1:26:36] he just comes along and he knows how to
[1:26:37] get to you and you get all worked up and
[1:26:39] and you know you worry and fret and you
[1:26:41] know you and it's like well no wonder
[1:26:43] you have so many problems
[1:26:45] you need to get into scripture it's like
[1:26:47] well i you know it's like no
[1:26:49] no no no listen listen
[1:26:52] god don't stutter no god ain't an indian
[1:26:55] giver
[1:26:56] if he wrote in his scripture then you
[1:26:58] know what he he didn't change his mind
[1:27:00] halfway through
[1:27:01] [Music]
[1:27:03] he ain't no he never changed his mind
[1:27:05] concerning his word
[1:27:07] so you know what if if you're a
[1:27:09] christian and you and you
[1:27:11] go before god and you've done exactly
[1:27:13] what god tells you to say then you know
[1:27:14] what god didn't change his mind about it
[1:27:18] you know you can be forgiven and you
[1:27:19] know what you just move on
[1:27:21] amen you know and the thing is is if the
[1:27:25] devil keeps bringing that stuff up then
[1:27:26] you know what
[1:27:27] god has the power in this scripture for
[1:27:29] him to flee amen you know you resist the
[1:27:32] devil he said he'll flee from you
[1:27:34] well but you've got to get behind the
[1:27:35] words you got to get in here and you got
[1:27:37] to stand here and say you know what i'm
[1:27:38] i'm free of those things
[1:27:41] i am free you know and you can't take
[1:27:44] that back from me why because
[1:27:46] he he whom the son is set free is free
[1:27:49] indeed
[1:27:50] i'm free and you can't take that away
[1:27:53] you've got to put the devil in his place
[1:27:58] don't let the devil hold you back
[1:28:01] from receiving what god has for you
[1:28:03] whatever the blessings of god has
[1:28:04] that god has for you you claim what god
[1:28:07] has given you
