[1:59] we're going to talk again on the sixth
[2:02] seal everybody see that and I'll be able
[2:08] to win open the sixth seal and lo there
[2:10] was a great earthquake and the Sun
[2:11] became black as sackcloth of hair and
[2:13] the moon became as blood excuse me in
[2:16] the stars of heaven fell unto the earth
[2:17] even at the fig tree casteth her
[2:19] untimely figs when she is shaken of a
[2:21] mighty wind and the heaven departed as a
[2:24] scroll ones rolled together every
[2:25] mountain and Island were moved out of
[2:27] their places the thing we had just a
[2:29] week ago is nothing compared to this ok
[2:33] this is going to be widespread damage
[2:35] right because remember if we're talking
[2:40] about a nature cleansing then this is
[2:44] all just truly just a pre-tribulation
[2:46] that we're having now we get spots of
[2:49] this spots of that you know this is
[2:53] going to be widespread we're gone the
[2:56] wrath of God is being poured out upon
[2:57] the whole world all right
[3:01] the kings of the earth and the great men
[3:04] and the rich men and the chief captains
[3:05] and the mighty men and every bondman and
[3:07] every free man hid themselves in the
[3:09] dens and the rocks of the mountain you
[3:10] seen out on the internet the other day
[3:11] where they that rich people are now
[3:13] buying those old silos that the missile
[3:16] yeah winning and they're building a
[3:19] doomsday concrete that you know am at
[3:22] five Megaton atomic explosion they can
[3:25] survive so many years they just never
[3:27] come to this spot yeah
[3:32] well that one right well now they're
[3:33] saying they can live there for seven to
[3:35] eight years they're racing their own
[3:38] stuff they have their own water supply
[3:39] they're saying they can live on the
[3:41] ground for seven or eight years till all
[3:42] this radiation gets away and then they
[3:46] can come up out of the bed they've never
[3:49] seen this and they can't come this is
[3:52] going to deal with they're trying to
[3:54] they're trying to survive man because
[3:57] right right
[3:58] they're trying to survive what man's do
[4:00] yeah they're on survival rap the dog you
[4:02] can go as far down as you want to on the
[4:04] earth right okay all right are wherever
[4:07] you want to go you can't have it man the
[4:09] kings of the earth and the great man a
[4:11] rich man chief captains mighty being
[4:12] every bondman ever freedom hit him
[4:14] selves in the dens in the rocks of the
[4:16] mountains and said to the mountains and
[4:17] rock followed us and hide us from the
[4:19] face of him that sitteth on the throne
[4:21] and from the wrath of the lamb for the
[4:23] great day of his wrath has come and who
[4:25] shall be able to stand now you got to
[4:27] remember
[4:28] sadly who sees this the religious world
[4:38] sinners don't care about the wrath of
[4:40] the Lamb they don't even know what a
[4:42] lamb is because they're looking for the
[4:45] great day of his wrath to come and he
[4:47] should be able to stand so this is sadly
[4:49] this is actually also this is the fifth
[4:51] I'm sorry I'm sorry this is the Buddhist
[4:57] version I would say 50 is not stiff to
[5:00] you at all
[5:01] it's the foolish virgins they're alive
[5:03] during the tribulation they're killed
[5:05] during the tribulation so this is
[5:07] Christian people that are crying out to
[5:10] God but see remember the deception that
[5:13] Satan has give us that's why I want to
[5:15] get on these seals because give you a
[5:18] secret that I found the other day
[5:21] remember Alexis for cleaving any venture
[5:26] today it works out just fine now
[5:29] remember now this is going to help you
[5:31] when we start in the sealed upstairs
[5:34] wind speed but we got a lot of
[5:36] background today all right you might got
[5:45] a strain in somebody Rican food and get
[5:53] their rebel bingo don't worry
[5:55] I want to show you something that
[5:58] they've really helped me about the seals
[6:01] go brother remember he he rolled up
[6:03] paper like this now remember it's gonna
[6:10] help you a lot
[6:12] is this the seal or it's back to see
[6:18] that's not the see this is the seal
[6:26] but the seal when it's broke
[6:38] so the first seal was a white horse
[6:40] rider but not this part this is the seal
[6:50] when the first seal broke this broke
[6:54] this didn't this is the thunder the
[7:01] assistant part that God wants you to see
[7:03] the supernatural element besides the
[7:06] revelation the Prophet said the
[7:07] revelation when this seal broke that
[7:10] lotmore's rivals Antichrist but it was
[7:12] not what John was getting ready right it
[7:15] was why steal that with a seal so that's
[7:22] one of the steel that's what we have
[7:23] main reactor that's not the revelation
[7:26] we need to get out of here this is a
[7:30] revelation we need to get into heaven
[7:32] alright so this is the wild horse riders
[7:36] the Antichrist like well yeah this is
[7:39] the outer earth there but that's what
[7:41] had this seal that's one had this seal
[7:49] same Selfoss a white righteous church
[7:51] God's acknowledge you and you've got it
[7:56] stayed over nobody can see what really I
[7:58] wrote because John listen I was looking
[8:01] in Revelation 10 John was beginning to
[8:03] write down what he saw so it was not so
[8:06] much a mystery that John could ride it
[8:09] right but he but say that's the part we
[8:13] don't get God told him the mighty angel
[8:16] said seal it up John
[8:23] with what with seven seals the seven
[8:26] seals we've been through really just six
[8:30] the six seals that we're going through
[8:32] now it's what back the rubber band
[8:37] that's one had sealed the real
[8:41] revelation is what we're getting
[8:42] underneath that okay you last s this is
[8:50] the thunder when the seal breaks this is
[8:56] not the thunder this is the thunder
[9:01] the unwritten part yet brother Gramps it
[9:04] had compared with every scripture than
[9:06] the Bible is and what compares with
[9:08] every scripture in the Bible
[9:10] redemption there is not one place in the
[9:13] Bible you cannot read without reading
[9:16] about Redemption that's why John was
[9:19] getting ready to write it down because
[9:20] John knew about the penance about the
[9:23] plan of redemption he just didn't know
[9:25] the whole right that's right so see that
[9:31] up John now there's not 14 seals he
[9:35] didn't break seven seals and then put
[9:36] several back home remember when he
[9:41] sealed it back up it was sealed until
[9:43] the seventh angel comes to break the
[9:46] seal of the white horse rider who is the
[9:49] Antichrist but what was underneath that
[9:51] seal was what God wanted to say what had
[9:56] it sealed this guy though he's not 14
[10:02] sealed now I see how close they are in
[10:04] the Philippines seven seals on the
[10:07] outside and settling on the backside you
[10:09] can see them but they're not there's
[10:11] only seven seals it's the Thunder that
[10:13] breaks under the seat this is the seal
[10:16] right wild horse riders anti crud all
[10:20] right brother Ram tore that steel off
[10:23] and he left this for us
[10:26] because this is the mystery the mystery
[10:29] hidden under the seal it's the seven
[10:32] thunders of Revelation in seven to ten
[10:35] whatever here 27 so if you look at it
[10:40] that way now in our mind this is what I
[10:43] thought seal number one this is the
[10:45] wholesale that it's not the whole signal
[10:49] this is a seal that's one had sealed up
[10:53] it had this sealed up but that's not the
[10:58] sale this is the sealed the first seal
[11:00] that broke when he broke the seal there
[11:02] was a thunder the thunders a voice it
[11:06] dog when the seal broke now look the
[11:08] voice of God we know broke the seal but
[11:10] the voice of God is not this sealed this
[11:12] seal was showing the Antichrist riding
[11:16] off
[11:16] see that's why I bet a lot of people say
[11:19] all of them read the seal book seven
[11:21] seals broke what else we got a deal it's
[11:25] what we got do they forget the part
[11:28] where John was forbidden to ride and
[11:30] told to seal it back up and don't ride
[11:33] them until the time of the what in okay
[11:41] and that's right now that's right so
[11:43] when the sale comes off we get the
[11:44] revelation that the property Godhead and
[11:46] then the book of predictions oh yes for
[11:52] being music so let's think about that
[11:53] and we'll get started on that maybe not
[11:56] this windy but maybe a little bit later
[11:57] on because it really bothered me that
[12:00] people would say is as Bob was speaking
[12:05] to a person in the message what about
[12:07] what about what do you mean the first
[12:09] seal was not only to reveal the
[12:12] Antichrist there was a hidden mixing in
[12:14] it well my heavens read revelation 10
[12:17] there was something sealed up to John 60
[12:20] luck and at the end time the mystery of
[12:24] God will be finished that's the mystery
[12:27] the first mystery is the seal I read
[12:30] and closely going in them in my mind all
[12:33] week we're better I'm sitting beside the
[12:36] revelation there's a supernatural
[12:38] element underneath that revelation so in
[12:41] other words you get a revelation you
[12:42] said that's it no that's just oh that
[12:44] just that just breaks the seal and he
[12:50] rides off so that you can understand
[12:53] what God's already wrote right here so
[12:57] this is not something new
[12:58] john was starting to write it in other
[13:00] words it was not unfamiliar to gun
[13:03] because immediately when he saw him or
[13:05] hurt him he said and I've started in
[13:09] other words I began to ride let's read
[13:12] that smoothly don't we go to Revelation
[13:14] teens right and we'll read it though
[13:19] right now we know the crime that's
[13:23] Christ in verse one here in his hand a
[13:24] little book opened and he said upon
[13:27] Fuquan scene left foot upon the earth
[13:29] cried with a loud voice and linework
[13:30] when he cried seven thunders started
[13:32] their horses then when the seven
[13:33] thunders at under the horse I was about
[13:35] to ride there with no hesitation John
[13:38] was getting ready to write down waist
[13:40] also it wasn't to me it was a mystery to
[13:44] John and he was getting ready righted a
[13:50] and I heard a voice from heaven saying
[13:53] to me
[13:54] now remember Christ is on the earth
[13:56] remember the mighty angels on the ark
[13:58] hear a voice from heaven say sealing out
[14:01] there's something else happening not a
[14:04] second person but Christ is breaking the
[14:06] seal down here the seals break on earth
[14:08] won't the Thunder sound owner right so
[14:12] there's no redemption in heaven
[14:13] yes retention happens down here enemy
[14:16] okay so that's my everything happened
[14:18] down here that's right but the boy says
[14:20] seal up those things would just seven
[14:22] thunders uttered and write them not he
[14:27] stopped right there in the engine but
[14:28] sour sauce down seeing an eat in the
[14:30] earth lifted up his hands
[14:32] I swear it and swear by him that live
[14:34] forever and ever who created heaven
[14:35] things therein now we know that's Christ
[14:37] that there should be time no longer
[14:39] biting the days of the voice of the
[14:41] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[14:42] sound the mystery of God should be
[14:44] finished and here declared to his
[14:46] servants now look at that right there
[14:48] why did he put that in there he didn't
[14:51] say his servant the prophet prophet
[14:59] spoke from Genesis to Revelation
[15:02] then was never not a prophet on the
[15:05] scene
[15:06] sure now there was a gap between let's
[15:09] get it right there was a gap between
[15:10] Malachi and Jesus of 400 years okay but
[15:16] what did they live off of what the
[15:18] Prophet said before all right so it's
[15:20] always white so one this is what I'm
[15:23] looking at is the mystery of God should
[15:24] be finished that he declared from Moses
[15:28] or Abraham or even Adam was a prophet
[15:31] that was the voice of God for his time
[15:33] rights right from them that time to the
[15:36] town that's a man somebody said
[15:38] something yes for their work they were
[15:40] talking about the the times and and
[15:43] stuff I said something about the Bible I
[15:46] said well the maddox something new
[15:49] coming I said wasn't it it's a young guy
[15:53] so what's new tell me what's new what's
[15:55] not what's new what do you mean wants to
[15:56] know that if the Bible doesn't tell us I
[15:58] said the Bible tells us then you see he
[16:00] comes down out of heaven in revelation
[16:01] 20:10 tells us what it looks like and
[16:04] who's don't live there how we're gonna
[16:06] live so that's all I need to know and
[16:09] then Conklin's into eternity and we do
[16:11] them you know we live the Bible he said
[16:15] you know you're right he said it does
[16:17] tell us all the ways we go up he talked
[16:18] about going home till it till we go home
[16:20] that's the African stream so anyway but
[16:23] he had declared it to his servants the
[16:25] prophets
[16:26] so those thunders have to be declared by
[16:30] prophets from the beginning to the end
[16:35] so it can't be now we know that brother
[16:38] Brown was the prophet in the same town
[16:40] ain't no doubt about that
[16:42] but Willie did a good job yesterday
[16:44] by explaining the understanding not
[16:48] beyond brother branham but the
[16:50] understanding that drew the profit gone
[16:52] his reveal the word for you and i write
[16:54] some a man that some o leading okay cuz
[17:03] people stuck in a pin list the people
[17:04] are stuck in a Pentecostal thought or a
[17:06] Pentecostal aid
[17:07] oh no no there's something hidden crack
[17:48] it's a secret right that's what that's
[17:51] what the prophets have to them the Bible
[17:53] word was making known was trying to
[17:56] reveal that was the secret right because
[17:58] somebody had to keep her good pulling
[18:00] back and identifying what the prophets
[18:03] had brought home went through correct
[18:05] and then if a couple of mystery for us
[18:07] to be so then you have a revelation of
[18:09] the mentor that's right and that's what
[18:11] we're getting now it's about a ministry
[18:14] says that this 60-ton like what were
[18:17] what we were going to talk about today
[18:19] was this seal broke in Genesis because
[18:24] there was a nature cleansing in Genesis
[18:26] the flood a huge major incident in
[18:31] Genesis was the flood he just cleared
[18:32] everything off but remember stand stayed
[18:36] here in ham when across the flood is
[18:39] started again showing that that's
[18:43] nothing new heaven a new earth that that
[18:44] is the havin trouble my brain today
[18:48] that's the Millennium
[18:51] coming into millennium everything's
[18:53] clear off when there's only a select
[18:54] group going through the devil is still
[18:56] back right
[18:58] he wasn't destroyed in the flood okay so
[19:03] we probably see how they saw the
[19:05] continuity Bible child everything yeah
[19:06] that's one of the thunders or cannot be
[19:09] anything out something about cannot be
[19:11] anything that the prophets had not
[19:13] already spoke because I will do nothing
[19:15] until I declare it to my servants the
[19:18] prophets and that right there says the
[19:19] same thing servants the prophets he has
[19:22] declared the servants of problems to
[19:23] none prophets is the only way we're
[19:26] going to get it but remember prophets
[19:29] were the word but remember they weren't
[19:33] the manifestation of their prophecy they
[19:39] were not the manifestation of their
[19:41] prophecy some of a prophesy haven't said
[19:45] why how does it work cannot say I failed
[19:47] what about a young man that I say with
[19:49] the young boy he was at home and I think
[19:51] walked out one day and said the virgin
[19:53] shall conceive and bring forth a child
[19:55] his name will be Emmanuel and all that
[19:58] and he walks by combing and I'm sure
[20:00] maybe sit down under a tree and said
[20:02] well that was about dumb
[20:05] they a person ever been born a virgin
[20:10] shall conceive me really because
[20:12] remember the Prophet that went and
[20:14] prophesied against Israel and then he
[20:15] went up on the hill and sat down and
[20:17] wanted to die
[20:18] I can't remember much wandering his head
[20:20] up hey God if one of them why the
[20:23] anointing came off them they weren't
[20:24] born again see now we have been
[20:26] privileged to have a Paul or Iranians
[20:30] martin luther colombo all the way up to
[20:31] brother branham that was a prophet that
[20:33] was born again because see they could
[20:36] write the word those prophets didn't
[20:38] write to her Moses now remember Moses
[20:41] wrote but man he was he was a special
[20:43] prophet
[20:44] amantha he was a special prophet Moses
[20:46] was special guy must be special because
[20:47] God took his body somewhere and hid it
[20:50] he came up into the Offaly over here
[20:52] somewhere he's fixing to use him again
[20:54] actually connected to this okay so there
[20:58] are special but remember everything that
[21:00] was declared was declared to the
[21:02] prophets okay
[21:05] now was brother Browns message the
[21:08] thunders yes part but no not all because
[21:14] remember inside his message was all the
[21:17] other prophets remember he had to
[21:18] compare with all the other prophets what
[21:20] he done is he brought well God did it
[21:22] God brought everything together so the
[21:25] you and I now can when the seals broke
[21:29] you know what a lot of people done a lot
[21:31] of people put the seal back on this this
[21:37] to them was more important than what was
[21:41] written here no this is the most
[21:44] important right because this will get us
[21:47] out of here this just shows you the
[21:49] Antichrist is and what he's doing and
[21:51] all of his work look like what we read
[21:53] but that's what struck me the other day
[21:55] I was trying to think of a way that I
[21:57] could explain that where you can
[21:59] understand it and I believe the Lord
[22:01] showed me how to do that because the
[22:04] seal is different than what's inside the
[22:07] steel is what these seals revelation
[22:10] sees one through
[22:11] whatever we're gonna read already read
[22:14] that's what sealed it up but it was a
[22:18] mystery and what I'm doing this I don't
[22:21] want I'd like to have one of those seals
[22:22] like the Romans had that they they took
[22:24] them and dip them they use beeswax and
[22:27] Cadillacs and they would make a stamp
[22:31] and it's stamping and what they do they
[22:33] roll it up and put that stamp right here
[22:36] because remember the seal remember give
[22:40] him what brother Graham said
[22:41] seal there's a finished work so when he
[22:43] sealed it this was done this thing could
[22:47] be written over it couldn't be added or
[22:49] taken away there's only one book that
[22:51] you can't add or take away from that's
[22:53] the Bible right but it was sealed out
[22:56] with that seagull and to the day we were
[22:59] death of your Redemption then the steel
[23:01] tore open and guess what you can see
[23:05] what's inside but you can't say what's
[23:06] inside unless that seal breaks but as it
[23:10] breaks I stinking the other day when I
[23:13] heard a clap of thunder remember it
[23:14] doesn't just go remember when the
[23:18] lightning hitting rumbles of thunder
[23:20] going Boom Boom
[23:23] remember I'm talking about roman candle
[23:26] do you really know when he's talking
[23:27] about when he said Roman camp man
[23:30] fireworks right okay but what is a roman
[23:32] candle bed you ever seen wrong that's
[23:39] exactly what happens and that's when
[23:40] he's talking about Revelation here's a
[23:42] roman candle and you got eight bottles
[23:44] go out like this this is just say five
[23:48] well when these go out these break off
[23:52] and these break up you end in now in
[23:56] human terminology it ends there's only
[24:00] so many times that it divides being God
[24:04] it never stops this revelation brings
[24:08] this revelation I mean
[24:10] halation which brings this business to
[24:12] homecoming yes it's like the time to
[24:14] Rolling Thunder roll boom boom boom boom
[24:17] boom that's not just enough
[24:18] oh brother Brown called it a loud clap
[24:21] of thunder but remember and all-natural
[24:26] it's not just a fun it roll it rumbles
[24:30] and that's what it does now this the
[24:33] revelation of this Mystery Continues to
[24:34] go on and on and on so I get through the
[24:38] seals first for this issue
[24:39] this is just a let's go back to
[24:43] revelation 6 I tell you what while we're
[24:46] over here let's go to 11
[24:48] well we're at last Sunday cuz in this
[24:54] nature cleansing we see that this I'm
[24:56] not gonna read all of it we know this is
[24:58] the two witnesses we know what they do
[25:00] we know they bring destruction to the
[25:04] earth in a natural form now see they're
[25:07] not here to spiritually destroy the
[25:09] earth see there I am to the Gentiles
[25:13] Gentiles or even there their judge the
[25:16] door shut we're gone and they deal in
[25:19] and I want brother bagel and he brought
[25:21] out I've listed here this morning he
[25:22] brought out a point that's very true we
[25:25] get so narrow-minded
[25:26] I read that quote sandy I was gonna read
[25:29] in church my dead brother answers people
[25:32] so narrow-minded these he put a red
[25:33] pencil between their eyes and when the
[25:38] Prophet said that Jim come out there so
[25:42] narrow-minded then you put a lead pencil
[25:44] between their eyes and it Bible it means
[25:46] anything but see I was so narrow-minded
[25:48] thinking that the 144,000 happens to be
[25:51] an injury people Jacobs people which is
[25:55] the true twelve tribes of Israel is in
[25:58] Iran Iraq Turkey they're scattered
[26:03] everywhere they're not sitting in the
[26:06] city of Jerusalem they'll come back
[26:11] that's what's gonna make the other news
[26:12] Mayo
[26:14] but somebody from Turkey and Iran and
[26:17] Iraq or Syria put them in Israel right
[26:20] now taking tapes up ahead and put them
[26:23] in Israel and to me they just broke the
[26:26] whole thing wide open because see I
[26:28] narrow mind is we got Jerusalem and
[26:30] there's 144,000 no Jewish people are
[26:34] scattered everywhere
[26:35] we know the Jews are coming back but
[26:39] they are the ones looking for the
[26:40] Messiah yes the prophets will start in
[26:47] Jerusalem for heavenly days the only
[26:49] time it can happen is in town they go on
[26:52] the internet listen to social media
[26:57] whatever you want to call it they hear
[27:00] these two people speaking and they hid
[27:02] that Jew roots of them and the Jews that
[27:05] are in Jerusalem of our life no you you
[27:10] people are not coming in here but that's
[27:12] Jake those people yes Daniel spent some
[27:15] time in Turkey talking to some people
[27:17] they know they're God's people they just
[27:18] can't get back into Jerusalem they're
[27:21] the real descendants listen the 12
[27:24] tribes came from Jacob right they're not
[27:27] saying in Jerusalem right now that's the
[27:29] problem
[27:30] they're scattered everywhere so I
[27:33] thought wow that's exactly why I let
[27:35] them the staunch Jews that are inside
[27:38] the city looking for the Messiah to come
[27:41] back and here comes my great people from
[27:43] Syria and Turkey and Iran and Iraq
[27:46] coming in saying we found it
[27:50] you listen these two guys preaching in
[27:53] your churches you must not be listening
[27:55] to but we hear something we've never
[27:58] heard before they get converted in them
[28:01] Jews are gonna be real ill that's a good
[28:05] point that was a good point because we
[28:08] get it in our mind that all the 144,000
[28:10] remember those four twelve tribes twelve
[28:13] little twelve thousand people from each
[28:15] tribe those tribes were from Jacob and
[28:17] they're not in Jerusalem that some could
[28:20] be but not the whole of
[28:22] the twelve tribes they're scattered
[28:25] everywhere all over that Middle East and
[28:29] when they start converging on Jerusalem
[28:32] the hold forth adopts Jews are not gonna
[28:35] like it so that's a good point I'm here
[28:39] and then I just started all the 12
[28:41] problems sentence somewhere in Jerusalem
[28:42] now there's only like three I have a
[28:44] million people in Jerusalem in the city
[28:46] proper four in Israel there's only four
[28:49] million people in the whole country of
[28:51] Israel 144,000 is not sitting in there
[28:55] they're out here remember they were
[28:58] dispersed right they were dispersed but
[29:02] now remember God told them where their
[29:04] land was up and in I had Jeremiah or
[29:10] somewhere he told them exactly where
[29:12] they would go Dan you go over here here
[29:14] from you go there and remember a lot of
[29:17] that's not in Jerusalem priory is real
[29:19] proper see we get narrow-minded about
[29:21] week we would say well that will brother
[29:24] branham even narrative more than that he
[29:26] said Palestine now Palestine not even
[29:28] Jerusalem
[29:29] remember the Palestinians are frightened
[29:32] Israeli they're fighting each other but
[29:35] he said Palestine is where Abraham was
[29:38] from came and that's where the cities go
[29:41] there he said that little spot aground
[29:43] in Palestine so there's a lot of things
[29:46] that we then you know if you just let
[29:49] God talk to you every once in a while
[29:50] like brother Dale said if you'll shut up
[29:52] and listen to what God said he'll tell
[29:54] you then it's not exactly not some
[29:58] people take some things that's worthless
[30:00] but once somebody tells you something
[30:02] you go and then what happens is like
[30:06] witness said yesterday the Holy Ghost
[30:08] just want to put this together not man
[30:10] the Holy Ghost puts him together he's
[30:12] just waiting on you
[30:14] he's waiting on you to say huh that's
[30:17] what that is
[30:17] because he's talking to uniques telling
[30:19] you and he's telling you these things so
[30:22] the same way with these two prophets
[30:25] when they come into Jerusalem now
[30:28] remember this is another thing that you
[30:30] got that you got
[30:31] 10 with it doesn't say they stay in
[30:35] Jerusalem it says they're killed in
[30:39] truth it doesn't say that anywhere in
[30:43] here doesn't say they stay inside the
[30:45] city it only says that when their time
[30:49] is over that they'll be in Jerusalem so
[30:59] they can fly the turkey free to go fly
[31:04] to Iran
[31:05] he walked serious of serious right there
[31:07] in Syria and Lebanon and all of the
[31:09] Lebanon
[31:10] you see what I'm talking about so let's
[31:12] not be so narrow-minded to profit
[31:14] systems they're not going to stand for
[31:15] three and a half years in the same place
[31:17] and I'm gonna stand in Jerusalem in you
[31:20] know no I think what I'm saying is
[31:24] they're moving around because fire is
[31:26] all the plays well you know they go to
[31:29] Turkey to get people out somebody comes
[31:34] against them because remember all the
[31:36] earth is plagued by them because
[31:42] remember it's got of it it's got to come
[31:45] by the preaching of the message you
[31:48] can't come any other way except by the
[31:49] preaching of the gospel the preaching of
[31:52] those two prophets is going to bring the
[31:54] 144,000 together all right so what's
[32:00] gonna happen is the two prophets you're
[32:02] gonna go out and preach just like we got
[32:04] hey how does some of you come in a bin
[32:08] stand preacher somewhere or you heard
[32:10] something on the internet you heard some
[32:12] tape to come into the message you heard
[32:14] of tithing you're a preacher so who's
[32:17] gonna get any different no kind of opens
[32:22] it up now where you can see on the two
[32:24] prophets can travel and go to different
[32:25] places because remember they're not
[32:27] gonna be heard until the three and a
[32:28] half years ago or so so they're like I
[32:30] said before last Sunday don't you think
[32:33] that by the time
[32:33] about six months when they start
[32:35] preaching that number one the Mossad is
[32:38] gonna be after them
[32:39] that's the KGB of Israel and then if
[32:44] they go to Turkey and something happens
[32:46] there and they get you know their
[32:48] intelligence agency the CIA is gonna be
[32:50] willing to kill them so see God's gonna
[32:52] protect them until that time of the
[32:55] three and a half years and then it says
[32:56] when their testimony is finished the
[32:59] beasts of the center now the bottomless
[33:00] pit shall make war against them and
[33:02] shall overcome them and kill them why
[33:04] because her message is over Moscow
[33:08] Walmart comes down all that all that
[33:10] comes together right in there all right
[33:12] okay because the mosque of Omar
[33:15] Edgewater that's a store in all of
[33:17] Israel side you know because that thing
[33:19] is it's here acted right over there
[33:22] right over there temple it's right there
[33:24] in Solomon's Court so that's just a sore
[33:27] spot anyway
[33:28] but remember we'll be done but this does
[33:30] give us insight in this seal breaking
[33:34] from the from the first of the Bible all
[33:37] the way to the very end all the way to
[33:40] the book to right here when I say the
[33:42] end I mean the end of the world as we
[33:44] know it when the battle are beginning
[33:47] happens that'll be the end of the world
[33:48] as we know it and we know what is this
[33:51] okay that'll be the end of it from a
[33:54] natural occurrence yes so we've it sort
[33:58] of man yeah son of David if you want
[34:02] Jews don't have to come back to being a
[34:04] hundred-foot without that you say that
[34:05] they all in one spot the projects people
[34:07] but only in New York or whatever you
[34:10] brought in the back in sure but that
[34:13] will be the sign of bigoted idea he's
[34:16] preaching to the Jews without her memory
[34:19] won't be the son of David until the
[34:21] millennium remember he's not son of
[34:23] David till the Millennium
[34:24] so that answered the whole thing that
[34:26] pushes it on further that's right okay
[34:28] because you got a son of God son of man
[34:30] then brother Brown says I mean sorry son
[34:33] of man son of God son of David remember
[34:35] I preached on that not too long ago but
[34:37] riding between there the son of man
[34:39] comes back to us now what's he gonna do
[34:43] to Israel he's not going to son of David
[34:45] Sunday was over here in a millennium
[34:47] that's right go that's when the promise
[34:49] the promise in the Bible was that he
[34:50] would sit on the throne judging the
[34:52] twelve tribes of Israel there's not
[34:53] twelve tribes of Israel over there now
[34:55] recognized okay right right but watch
[34:59] the two prophets going to do they're
[35:00] gonna recognize them bring them together
[35:03] now look what they're going to preach
[35:04] they're gonna preach it so much so we're
[35:06] there you know Dan they're gonna know
[35:09] the Danites are gonna know that there's
[35:10] twelve thousand in there if all the ones
[35:16] they're gonna understand and know that
[35:17] they came from that tribe only two
[35:21] prophets can tell them that
[35:23] remember when brother Branham went out
[35:25] west to that Indian Reservation right
[35:28] and they had a problem with their
[35:29] landings and all that brother Graham sat
[35:31] down and said you you you grandfather
[35:34] and this America this one and this one
[35:35] way wasn't it the spirit of the life
[35:41] it hit the spirit of Elijah in one of
[35:44] these prophets that was sit down and say
[35:45] what makes me feel good that God have
[35:49] take ten people and send them down and
[35:50] say you come from your whole heritage
[35:53] was in the heritage of Levi your whole
[35:56] heritage was the heritage of the Damned
[35:57] and your home heritage was this what a
[36:00] powerful dog lessor 2,000 years
[36:05] dispersed everywhere but God knows he's
[36:07] actually this one the day ain't gonna
[36:09] bring them right now cuz remember folks
[36:10] you and I are Nations they're gonna be
[36:14] only 12,000 and he's fat that's all
[36:17] I don't 44,000 and - we're going
[36:19] interactive you can't forget the problem
[36:21] kind of 24,000 and - we're going on a
[36:23] rapture not 147 - 48 so so the spirit of
[36:28] a life that's going to come in and say
[36:31] right here this is your lineage this you
[36:34] know what Moses here's Moses standing
[36:36] there beside of him he's one set the
[36:39] whole thing up
[36:41] right he's you want to set the whole
[36:43] thing up back from Jacob he was the one
[36:46] that literally led those 12 so he's
[36:50] gonna be as happy as all get-out of
[36:52] yourself by man we're putting this back
[36:54] together so what uh what a great thing I
[36:58] don't want to be here to see it but I'd
[37:01] like to hear him tell about it after we
[37:02] get written into the Millennium I'd like
[37:05] for him to tell us about okay and I
[37:08] believe they will I believe they'll tell
[37:11] us about but you see how they stick
[37:12] sealed though is so important because
[37:15] it's breaking right at the very end it's
[37:19] breaking and it's a nature breaking
[37:21] because remember the two prophets are
[37:24] not spiritually doing anything to the
[37:26] world except 144,000 right that's it
[37:30] so the spiritual part is you and I the
[37:33] sixth seal has the break to us a nature
[37:36] cleansing by the spoken word has to
[37:38] clean us up to get us out of here we're
[37:41] the only thing standing in the way of
[37:42] them two prophets coming call there's no
[37:44] date that they're supposed
[37:45] be over there we're the reason of their
[37:49] high over there now he's getting us
[37:51] ready to a place to get us out of the
[37:53] way so that God can deal with the gym
[37:58] but man said God waiting on you and I
[38:00] adoption time when God throughout its
[38:02] fullness all those quotes come back to
[38:04] one you know the Prophet is telling us
[38:08] so it's a nature cleansing becomes by
[38:11] the spoken word because remember all
[38:13] these things are happening in nature now
[38:15] is happening because of the devil the
[38:19] devil is the prince in power the air so
[38:23] that hurricane that was all the devil
[38:26] but these two prophets though are going
[38:29] to call a nature cleansing by the spoken
[38:32] word of God take 144,000 out start the
[38:39] world into chaos and then leave right so
[38:44] the seal is broke what is that seat
[38:47] sealed the prophecy two prophets they
[38:51] are that seal but now look what
[38:54] underneath that see what we've just been
[38:56] talking about and we can keep talking
[38:58] about we can keep talking about but the
[39:00] seal is the two prophets once that's
[39:03] broke we can see everything else is
[39:04] underneath and how it all connects
[39:05] together let's go
[39:08] [Music]
