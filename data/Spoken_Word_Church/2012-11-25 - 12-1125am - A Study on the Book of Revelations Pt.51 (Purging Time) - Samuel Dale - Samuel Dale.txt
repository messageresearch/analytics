Lord thank you for guiding us and keeping us thank you for everything we ask you now that you would just come and speak to our hearts that we may Lord speak to your people what you've given unto us to say and then you come Lord behind and show your word to be true and follow it with signs and wonders because we believe you he said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we just depend upon you just have your way now now as we read your word you come and honor your word and guide each and every one of us in Jesus name amen amen had had to do some juggling around this morning with everybody being out remember each one W and Junes now W preaching for brother U Jo Hughes this morning so remember that they be traveling back late this afternoon let's just read our scripture that we've always we've read each one says verse one says the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who by record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand what the time to understand all right chap 6:12 and when he had opened the six seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth of ha and the moon became as blood and the stars of Heaven fell unto the Earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of A Mighty Wind and the heaven departed as a scroll and it rolled away and every mountain and Island were moved out of their places and the kingdoms of the this Earth SK excuse me and the kings of this earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the Mighty Men And every bondman and every Freeman hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sth on the throne and from the Wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath is come and who shall be able to stand you may be seated the Lord at is blessing to the reading of the word now I want to read I didn't give it to them but I want to read Matthew uh 24 and read verse 29 and 30 which is where around said this is where the the seals are that in Matthew 24 said immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the son be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the Stars shall fall from Heaven and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in the Clouds Of Heaven with power and great Glory all right and we'll try to get to that point after a while if we can but we've been talking about the seals and we want to relate back to make sure that we don't lose our thought because four seals first four seals covers the Earthly journey of mankind all right the four seal winding up being at Armageddon which would be the termination of forces you know coming forth there in Armageddon and then in doing that then we see that this six seal that we've been talking about that that six seal will take place during that time of the purging of Israel the setting aside and getting ready and we'll be at the uh Armageddon because that will be the see you you just lay that seal right back there just like you take the fifth seal and you go through the Earthly journey and you see that it winds up at Armageddon as we said but the fifth seal goes back and shows you the Jews from Calvary up until the Rapture of the church all right then that way you can follow it through the word so then the six seal takes place TimeWise upon the Earth during the time of what we would call the fourth seal dealing with Armageddon because that will be you know Armageddon Edon will be at the end of the 3 and 1/2 years of the ministry of the two witnesses to Israel and they will be at that time in what we've been talking about calling it the uh Jacob's trouble or the time of understanding of the purging of Israel to uh see where we're at all right and it's during that time as we've tried to cover that uh those two prophets wrestle with God until they pull out 144,000 we read that from the from the six seal of paragraph 264 we're going to jump down a couple and just quote them but this is time of the tribulation period is known as Jacob's trouble because Jacob wrestled with the angel of the Lord you know and was their uh name changed from Jacob to Israel and if you'll get over in the seventh seal and read right before he starts into the seventh seal he says that this you know this is the purging time or the setting aside of Israel and he says now we'll go into the seventh seal so he uses that and then we'll drop back and maybe this afternoon pick up why he's speaking those things but you understand what I'm trying to say say this six seal is the Tribulation period all right we covered this past Wednesday and I hope everybody will listen to the tape of what we tried to preach on this past Wednesday of the six seal being the Judgment seal of the word all right that would be found in paragraph 144 through 146 of the six seal it has nothing to do with the bride he says because she's already gone but this is the Judgment seal of the word it's the Judgment upon the church you know the foolish virgin form Church further rejecting or you know not accepting or maybe not hearing uh the message or maybe been blinded by false Shepherds and those are quotes from the prophet of what that would deal with but it's after the Rapture of the bride and this is the the time of the Jews that will there will be 144,000 called out and as they're called out then there has to be as what we want to take up in a minute and just go on through because Wednesday night I just took a little part of what I want you to see and talking about the Judgment seal of the word how that you and I we must judge ourselves right the Bible says examine yourself to see whether you're in the faith or not right see then we're being judged by the word that we hear amen you say but but brother Dale I believe the word that's all right but the word that we hear is judging us and that's the only way we can come up the stature of a perfect man amen right that was what I was trying to get across Wednesday night was that it's a judgment seal and in the communion there you know it says we judge ourselves then we won't be judged right see then we better get down serious because it's a late hour we talk about the End of Time the end of this or that or the other everything looking bad yeah so we better judge ourselves to see whether we're in the word or not right that's what the sick seal has to do with you and I because it's a purging time we covered then that sanctification is a purging of the individual amen you know to bring us to a place all right then watch that now as we read about Israel the world and the things but watch it as you know us now remember that's what I've been asking you to do is read the seal book to find yourself in each seal even though we're not over there where the sick seal takes place we know that but we're not over there where the first seal takes place when a man of sin sits in the temple of God showing himself to be as God we're in the part that's leading up to that because all of these seals is after the Rapture going to Israel but see we can see ourselves then see their Plan of Redemption see our Plan of Redemption we see they are going to be the 144,000 going to be in the Millennium well how did they get there that's the plan of redemption right all right now the Lord willing next Sunday I want to if I can now I want to preach just a message may quote a lot but not giving notes and things but just preach on the Plan of Redemption I've been aiming to do that since we started on this but I I I believe it'll be time to the Lord willing next Sunday so you know make sure you at least hear the message you're not going to be present then try try to hear the message cuz I want to put into one message what I believe about Redemption all right and for all peoples and all like that all right now then we we got up to the point talking about the Judgment seal of the word Jesus Christ was judged right for you and I amen M hanging on Calvary M all right he took our place he was purged more than anybody ever had been purged if you want to talk about a beating uh uh things happening in his life for you and I all right well then all we got to do is accept what he says yes Lord and believe it yes Lord you see Israel will have to go through the tribulation 144,000 for their purging the foolish virgins must be placed there for their purging all right right their judgment we see you and I have got to be purged by the word amen Washed by the Water of the word right then if we purge ourselves we won't have to be purged you get it if we judge ourselves and find ourselves guilty and cry out to God he can cleanse us and do as we talked about on sanctification because that means to be cleansed and set aside for service amen twofold part of that doing see purging us and set soci all right now you find a lot that the prophet would say about purging how that Jesus Christ was so purged so judged until he died that you and I don't have to be see this six seal shows the purging it'll show the purging of the foolish virgins the purging of the fifth seal Jew goes in parts of it because they're represented cuz they've gone through theirs down through time of being killed now I use the word the way I wanted it represented you see later why I'm using that because you you got your 144,000 to be purged in the tribulation with Dan and Ephraim missing right but in the Millennium Dan and Ephraim will be present so what about your other 24,000 it'll have to be done by representation right John went up in Revelation 41 right as what a representation or type example of the bride of Christ right see then Jesus Christ was purged for you and I all those horrible things we think about happening to him was because of you and me so then our representation we must believe it that's right not well brother Dale maybe he was just purged a little bit for me then you're the one that needed the purging right okay you get those goody goody ideas that you didn't need purging you got a problem with the word of God and the Judgment seal of the word will strike you that's what I'm hoping will happen to all of us that we'll see these things and recognize ourselves and see what's going on in our own lives right instead of just looking at what's happening to Israel to see them over there and see what takes place but see a purging this is a purging time see something has to happen for you and I to be able to go up through the statue of a perfect man that's right and I preached to you for many years what that is it's the revealing of God's word all right that's the only way I know those virtues can come they're not an automatic process that we just lay back and take it easy and everything come forth amen right so then in that we must as the word is being revealed every time God reveals something to me it don't make my head big you better believe it makes me smaller than ever before to think that he would reveal to me his word yes see then that's a purging if you don't get nothing out of the message today get that part now if we talk about them being purged remember the opening of the word is doing the same to you and I it's purging us I said the opening of the word not because we have it in our possession not because we believe the message but when the message is revealed that's why it's the Judgment seal of the word so it's shown all the way through the word how that things are made correct remember the judgment comes because something went wrong right right every time the children of Israel would turn away from God he put them into captivity right yes sir things would happen what to purge him that's right because they had went into sin till then every time that we turn around the word is facing us to cleanse us right Purge us to set us free and if we don't repent we W have to answer for it that's right you say what's born again Christian yeah because there is a judgment of the Deeds Done in the body whether good or bad if we don't get rid of it here by cleansing it's going to be purged somewhere that's right you know what that purging going to be you think you get by with it here well I don't want to stand up and tell the church I've done this or that or the other one day you're going to stand before the entire body of Jesus Christ right that's right not a judgment of whether or not you receive eternal life no so the six seal goes on down through time you're going to have to answer for the Deeds Done in the body whether good or bad and we're going to have to do that before all of our brothers and sisters that's right so how much should we want to get rid of these things instead of just allowing them to go on and think we got f with it we're get to Dan and Ephraim in this afternoon the Lord with him you know they thought they got by with it when Dan and Ephraim was taken out did they think they had been taking out don't you think about that did they even consider they had been taken out don't they right on being Dan and ephra right thinking it was right all right then a purging a setting aside getting us ready and the studying of the seal to see ourselves all right let's start off on what we got on the notes then let's go to the number three brother I told him I just quote the first two look what he says 6 Co par paragraph 3:21 in Israel let's take this I mean excuse me Isaiah let's take this Isaiah the prophet seen this sick seal open and spoke of it no he said well how did he see this sick seal open cuz he was a prophet the Bible says that the things that were done unto them were not for them but for us that's right is that Bible right yes all right now so Isaiah the prophet seen it open just like Daniel heard the Thunders see Daniel saw the whole thing see Isaiah was looking forward to seeing it but seeing what was taking place in his life then or the day they were in as I said a minute ago then he could see that when they would do wrong they would go into judgment and he would see it and Isaiah would see as we'll get to it later Isaiah would see all the way over to the cleansing of the world right that's right so then when the prophet would say he seen it in his time or you know that seal was all the way back there right one seal out the Bible get it right entire Bible so they don't get into confusion well how in the world Isaiah see the six seal he wrote about it we must have seen it Isaiah 65 that's right right look at down a minute to that and you'll see but don't just get hung up on something how did Isaiah see that that six seal was the way down here it was spoke of all the way through the word first seal was spoke of all the way through the word second third fourth fifth that's what I've been trying to get you to see it was spoke of throughout the word and now remember we seen Jesus saw it now Isaiah seen it and spoke of it Isaiah 65 we'll get to it in a little while Jesus saw it in Matthew 24 right I saw it and then we find others that saw it we find it tyed out in Jacob we find it tyed out in Egypt we see it tyed out at the cross don't get what it's being said Isaiah saw it Jesus saw it and spoke of it all right but Jesus didn't just speak of it he had to partake of it right for you and I not for himself right so now let's let's go on and just read a you go ahead and on for paragraph 327 6 watch this six opening here now Plum back here 730 years before Christ come in Christ come he's been he's been 2,000 years that'd be about about 2700 years ago Isaiah seen this sealed hanging there Isaiah looked and saw it he saw a purging of Israel and come on do do we need to bring this one where brother said that Isaiah wrote a complete book where Isaiah saw the beginning then he saw the coming of John the Baptist and Jesus coming right and see the cross Isaiah 53 Isaiah 65 he covers the created a new Heaven and a new Earth so he saw it mankind down through there has seen these things okay now what about it in the end time go ahead with the next one 3:11 3126 heal and we he was about to deliver his only begotten son which was his only begotten Jacob is his son but this is his only begotten Matthew 27 let's see what he did there Matthew the 27th chapter now remember his son had been beaten he had been troubled and they had made fun of him and he was now hanging on the cross at 3:00 on Good Friday afternoon just about to take place Matthew 27 chapter of Matthew in the 45th verse I believe it is all right and watch what he goes on to he goes straight from the sick now then sixth hour there was Darkness over the land until the night that's in Matthew right now he goes to revelation behold when it opened the sixth Hill there was a great earthquake the sun in the darkness no Blackness see it was spoke of all the way through the word and you come down to Moses in Egypt T out at the cross Moses in Egypt coming out Blackness darkness and things spoke of all the way through the Bible a purging when you see a purging going on you realize that there's something about that seal and they spoke of it Isaiah spoke of it Jesus spoke of it Moses and his doings tyed it out amen that's why you can come over the end time and close the heavens CU it already done it once and what one of the two witnesses will be what in the spirit and the power of Moses to bring down the plagues to purge he knows how to do it cuz he's done it before but Jesus Christ at Calvary didn't just speak of it he partook of it right right the reason he partook of it was because of you and I that's right amen are you following me to speak of it is one thing to write of it is one thing but to live it Jesus didn't just speak of it he did in Matthew 24 sure but then he went forth and made manifest because the Judgment of all things came upon him the Judgment of every sin that has ever been committed or ever will be was placed on him but he took that mainly for you and I come on church because even that some words got to be reckoned with about the things that have happened through then there'll have to be a day that he'll judged the or purged the foolish virgin you purged 144,000 he has to purge Israel right then he has to purge the world right amen that's what Isaiah was speaking of the world has got to be cleansed there can't be a millennial Reign without a purging right so there's you six seal amen the purging of all things trying to cut down on some that where won't be so much going over to number seven which is paragraph 141 of the S seal and we open get to the seal did you know no that we first we start out now Israel then we see the first church not the bride the pur Church by tribulation remember the church goes through the tribulation the bride don't go through the tribulation right all right he sees them coming up where Revelation 7 a great number of real sinere hearts have come up the Great tribul the church and gone the bride Andes the church word Israel to be purged the church is to be purged and you see them in chapter 7 that they're purged but not the bride you understand what I was trying to get to a minute ago Jesus just didn't speak of it that was great mhm Isaiah he spoke of it right but he never what would be the word or he never experienced it or participated in it sure in his day he lived and was hunted I mean was persecuted and everything for what he said but not what he saw under that six seal purging he saw they' have to be a new Heaven and a new Earth right Jesus spoke of it in Matthew 24 but then he went on to experience it right a purging the calvary but if he hadn't done that you and I wouldn't be here I hope you're following me I keep repeating myself because I find out a lot of times if I don't repeat myself people will say you said so and so but if I repeat it two or three times I've got very few people to come and say you said so and so all right Jesus actually had to experience it he had to live through it for you and me amen right but see then we can't be just left out of it that's why you must be justified yes sir and Sanctified cleansed and set aside purged judge yourself unworthy and die to yourself that's right right we've got to experience it not the six seal Judgment of the tribulation of the wrath of God poured out no we don't go there the reason we don't go there is because we judge ourselves that's right we pray for forgiveness Amen to purge ourselves right brother R said now here's a quote you need to look up but I'll you find it for you he said I I believe in a Purgatory wait a minute now well he said it he said because our purging is going on now that's right he said that's the kind of purgatory I believe in a purging now M right right a cleansing now amen you realize try to get to it in a minute to where we see that this world has got to be so cleansed until they can't be any sin the world and we know it's not going on over to the Future home because this is only speaking of it that's why we when you get into Isaiah 65 you you find a a little problem it's not a problem to me because I know what he's talking about but all it spoke of in Isaiah 65 is a millennial Reign but the prophet uses it for the future harm there's going to be a drastic purging over there later right that's right right we got to get this thing clean enough for where the Millennium can take place that's right amen and I said that the way I wanted to we got to get this time right the reason Israel is going to be qualified to go into the Millennium the 144,000 is because they're going to be purged right if you and I are not Purge we we're not qualified right right if we're not Sanctified cleanse and set aside then we don't have the new birth that's right amen you can't bypass the the processes and get the new birth then go back and get Sanctified it doesn't work that way now I don't believe when we get to heaven we're going to be good people we're going to be what we are here that's right right it only changes our dwelling place so now Jesus actually had to experience it but it wasn't for himself right he didn't have to be purged amen he's perfect that's right you didn't have to be cleansed but he said I set myself aside he judged himself the fact that he knew he must die take all of that punishment and even go to hell for you and I amen a pury that's why you and I we go through processes here we go through a justification a repentance you then we go through sanctification to be cleansed and set aside but then we have to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost or we're not qualified for the Millennium that's right we're not Israel we're not somebody that is given because that he blinded them right we're blind we're lost that's right amen so we better start judging ourselves that's right to find out whether or not we're born again go remember remember he done that for you and I he experienced a a cleansing a purging for you and I not that he needed it but we must have it amen then not only do we have to have the new birth you know the fiery baptism of the Holy Ghost coming in to purge out all things to where he can live in our heart our soul we must have a daily sanctification like Paul said I Die daily amen but then there's got to be somebody in the end time that's going to be so purged by the word yes sir believe that God can come and live in US amen the way he wants to amen so cleansed until there's no sin what do you mean Brother D I got born again I ain't sin since then you are liar and a hypocrite that's good enough you want other word sharper the Bible says we sin the prophet said we sin every day right right right so don't go into the garbage cans with it cuz you'll never get anywhere with cleansing if you don't admit you got something you need to be cleansed from that's right amen amen so Isaiah could speak of it Moses could speak of it the prophets could speak on a purging that would have to come one day we good to it to this afternoon where that Moses and the Dan and Ephraim taken out their names will be put back so they going to have to be purged their names will never was taken off the book of life but you and I our names removed we're lost what about it church we the reason we don't have to go through these things in regardless if that 144,000 receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost white robes the F seal Jew gets white robes the Old Testament Saints will have to get white robes but yet they still never went through the experience that's right while it was alive that's right you said well the the 144,000 do yeah but they doesn't turn down sunship so they can't come in but I want you to think of something that 144,000 represents all Israel if not how you going to get them there that's for later it's the statement I'd write that down and think on it you got to have a representation you don't have any statements like we used to think that maybe they' go to the white drone cuz that's what I used to think until I find out they get white robes before the 144,000 are killed you said but now wait just a minute got you trapped just in case somebody wants to figure it out later I'll get back to it I'll just say it you think you got it trapped but you better hold on the prophet explained Revelation 7 it's not all after the opening of the seals it's all in the opening of the SE get back to that look listen go down to number 10 because we talk about the seventh seal being in a three-fold manner sorry about that yes get up H to every time I move so I quit trying to move so look what he says this is on the seventh seal paragraph 386 388 through there and we find out in this that the six seal now being opened it was for a three-fold purpose now here was the purposes the first was that the sleeping virgin had to go through the tribulation period for purification now their purification don't give them eternal life it only makes them qualified thank with me their purification don't give them eternal life they got to go to the white WR to get eternal life right don't tie Israel in there now because we'll get back to that see the first was as sleeping virgin had to go through the tribulation period for purification she had to be purged for sins of unbelief and rejecting the message R said over in the message somewhere that is talking about those who never heard the message or those who are blinded by false Shepherds but by rejecting the message look what you do well I just don't believe in that old stuff y'all talk about and all that hair and dress and well the word says it that's right word says we used to preach that before we heard of a prophet on back about 50 years ago or 60 there was a lot of preaching about that and all the denominations used to preach it and you know it cuz you some of you was there and you're old enough to remember it and you remember none of those women would come to church without a hat on my mother-in-law would have never darted into a church without a hat on why they knew they had to have a covering right and somebody told him it was a hat instead of the word right to their hir that they have but watch J be Pur of her sins of unbelief and rejecting the mission this was done in the tribulation period we see they wind up over here in Revelation [Music] 7 between the 6th and the 7th chapter here and she's first and she's been given her robes all right they will get white robes remember where to get it now she's not the bride but it's the church the pure people that that didn't have the opportunity maybe to receive the message or in some way were blinded by the false prophets there heard the rest of the quote they didn't get a chance and they yet they're really sincere people and God knows their heart in near their Purge during this time now I want to preach on that representation but I'm trying to keep from it because is it only the end time that has foolish virgins and brother R said this virgin foolish virgins never ate I can show you a quote where he said it would pointed down to the end time yeah but he said there foolish virgins in never age when another foolish virgins in time passed where's their representation they're not under tribulation down to the ages right come on but they're under representation cuz it's last day foolish virgin will represent him she'll be purged under the wrath of almighty God said no brother Dale that sounds like you're talking about somebody doing something for you no I'm just talking about representation I'm just talking about John represented the Rapture amen right as one person I'm talking about Enoch represented the Rapture right I'm talking about Noah rode up when over he don't represent the Rapture right he's got his representation see there's a representation from predestination I'll get back to that one of these days if not somebody ask me a question CU that's what I'm going to do in the Lord willing next Sunday I'm going to preach a message across and in the afternoon will'll be questions and answers okay so write down your questions we'll try to cover them takes two or three messages we'll do that but you see what I'm talking about first thing was the foolish virgin she's not the rde and everything else really sere Purge Purge and watch you notice that another purging time that's for Israel when she gathers that's the second fold God purges Israel in the tribulation period out of the millions that's gathered there there will be a selected 144,000 and they will be purged also God's purging Israel all right now there is a whole earth to be purged number three there will be such a thing that the moon stars and nature be Pur you see what it is the Earth is renewing herself being purged getting ready for the Millennium hold that in your mind the Millennium millenniums coming up you see everything that's got any filth in it has to be purged during the six seal now everything there got any sin to it going to be purged during the sick seal remember one thing this evening's message there's only six seals written in the word of God you said well wait a minute there's seven no it says silence in [Music] heaven Jesus never spoke of it in Matthew 24 sure there Seven Seals of redemption don't go off and run me in the wrong way what will be that seventh [Music] seal if there's only six seals so in the Plan of Redemption okay so the whole earth is to be purged everything is to get ready why number 11 as you call look paragraph 32 63 423 428 I just finished a series of services on the last seven seal and finding in this Sixth Seal that there was a great interruption in in nature the moon the stars the Earth belts the church is purged Israel is church purged and everything is purged under that seventh seal it's the seventh seal yeah CU it's the end of all things good it ends a purging okay we got any problem why is it have to be purged so that the Millennium can start in you can't have a millennial Reign without the purging you reading on down that's what the church today listen to you and I and what I want to point to you that we need a cleansing before anything can begin from God we got to have a purging right and when we look and see these things that is now under the present condition ex just in the way they are we can see that we got in got to have something to happen before God can continue his program and a purging continue his program without a purgy that's talking about me and you that's not talking about over there right he's talking about me and you you want a Revival then start repent what it is start praying for a purging no I want to Revival Revival don't come without a purging rapture won't come without a purging M that's why brother Brandon made the statement he said the church does better under persecution right right brother Dale you want persecution I want a Rapture and if that's what it takes to bring it amen yes sir what do you want well I I want ride out of here on fire b e well hasn't been done before right but before the Millennium can start there has to be a cleansing first and that's what the church today and I want to point to you that we need a cleans him you remember his first wife and child was taken from him because of Disobedience true he was praying one day he said you purged me one time Lord he's talking about the death of his wife and daughter and the problems of things he said Purge me again when I see next in your mind go what he wanted his wife to be killed in this boy I quit being stupid that wasn't what he wanted right he wanted whatever God wanted right what was the reason that his wife and daughter was taken cuz he listened to his wife about her mother Y and he would not go to the world world and be an evangelist brother R said we let our families we let the preacher we let everybody get in the way chur you know what about a purge you he wanted to be so s side for God until whatever it cost him right he goes on in the message looking there in the message but it's paragraph 256 he's talking about Israel and look what he says she's got everything she's Israel what she's there ready for the purging that God will take that 144,000 from it Israel today is dire for a purging got to be in the Homeland right right you and I got to be in the Homeland what is the Homeland for you and I the message of the hour that's right amen amen but how many are reading it our love story magazines have you ever read a love story magazine everything in it is beautiful isn't it there's not a dab of Truth in it at all cuz reality don't live like that right you go to work every day and the people around you smell so good and they're neatly dressed right but do you think they live like that all the time you got a problem so you read Love Story magazines to try to figure out how to be something why not just be a Christian amen and then out way we take the ups and the Downs don't we right okay but see we live in a fantasy world right but listen church he said Israel was ready for a purging are you and I ready for one that's right yeah it could have already be at the White House outy that you don't get another check and you know what in this church it would really be a whacko cuz there's a lot of us drawing from the government one stroke of the pen and all your money in the bank is no good you complain all you want to they can't do that to me I'm an American citizen about that Castro changed the money down in Cuba he didn't ask him if they citizens that's right he just changed the money Brother D you think we're going I don't know what we're going through go when we get it figured out that's what we're going through it ain't going to be what we're going going through right so quit trying to figure it out just live day by day and forget it right but I would tell you you to put your a can of beans up in the closet somewhere you may need it one day right no Brother D when I need it go to be there the children of Israel thought that about God but he sent them through many times of purging because of their unbelief lot of people don't believe in the persecution I don't believe in a tribulation for the bride no way but they sure a lot of things would brother around said you could have been physically barff right well I don't think he'll do that to the bride what's he going to do when we need persecution come on if we won't judge ourselves he's going to have to judge us right that's right is that true that's right that's right okay go ahead and live in well I'm going to be there anyway day don't matter what it do you know where you're headed when you're talking like that you're headed to the tribulation period right without any hopes of being a foolish virgin because when you're talking like that you're admitting you believe if you admit you believe you can't qualify for a foolish virgin you mean brother Dale there's no hope for me being a foolish Virg I don't believe for myself I just honest it's either Rapture or Hell busting wide open for me cuz you see I judged myself on that one time this message is right right I don't have no extra money laying over in the Swiss bank account just in case it don't work see a purging for the bride yeah but but we're but we're pure and holy C we're pure holy and clean if we thought it correctly we repent we don't repent we ain't pure and holy right come on you give an account of the Deeds Done in the body whether good or bad you don't believe that right that's not a decision of whether or not you get eternal life you have eternal life we do but we'll answer for the Deeds Done in the body amen well I know I tell you what I can't understand you because you preach one time we're pure as a l you preach the next time we're Sinners that's exactly right both of them is right that's right right According to which one we qualify for but [Music] listen I got a whole lot of quotes here but I don't want to get into it so let me preach a little bit in Matthew 24 there of verse one 2 and three Jesus had made a statement and he said one of these days it won't be one stone left on another out here so they got together that afternoon and sat down with him and they said you made a statement about they won't be one stone or another said when will that be and what will be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world they asked him three questions brother around said he answered three questions all right question number one when will it be that there won't be one stone left on another Titus and 870 I got the quote Cay here if you want it from the prophet Titus and ad70 but have you really thought about what was asked in and what he said remember it was in Matthew 24 that he answered those three questions in Matthew 24 is the six seals right now you're supposed to be reading the book you know to understand Matthew 24 is the six seals ver seal is verse four and Jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many amen for seal right white horse rider second seal is verse 6 you hear wars and rumors of wars ends not yet third seal verse 7 Nations shall rise against Nations and Kingdom against Kingdom be pestilence earthquakes and dark all these things are the beginning of Sorrow verse 9 for seal and they shall deliver you up and to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all Nations the many false prophets shall rise and deceive many but now listen three [Music] questions when will it be that there won't be one stone left on another when will it be it or what will be the sign of thy coming and the end of the world he answered of in six seals he answered their questions in six seals right the first is Titus right 8070 let's see I'll give you that where be on people might argue about that point I'll get to it in a second where he says it's Titus yeah all right uh paragraph 30 of the unfailing words of promised he talks about 8070 and that's when it would be one stone left on another okay but he answers three questions what will be the sign of thy coming it's the coming of the son of man right is that what we've been in in the seal or and thing what about the end of the world blood ROM will it be the end of the world number 13 I jumped up and down so if it takes him a little time paragraph 425 The Sixth Seal he's talking about the seal watch the next thing he said now learn a parable and learn a parable is not in verse one or 2 three or four learn a parable is verse 30 or 31 31 somewhere in there so it's all coming together then he starts on Parables these things will be he's answering them three questions they're so particular about busting up this new part of the message to change paragraphs I I wish I could help them a little bit cuz that should be made another paragraph cuz it changed his thought then he starts on Parables that's one thought then when these things be he said these things will he's answering them three questions what will be the three sign these signs and what will be the sign of your coming what will be the sign of the end of the world and the six one there was the end of the world now brother brand the sixth one he said is the end of the world what does your mind think of when you think of end of the world when there's never a time in eternity or anywhere that the world has done away with you agree come on you in the future home passes from one form to another we're going to come right back to this world the future home correct brother ROM what do you mean what did Jesus mean when he said and they ask him what will be the end of the world when that sick seal BL forth the Armageddon and the cleansing and the things going on thereafter that will be the end of the world order of system of mankind right right sure be the end of the world the sick seal will be the end of the world not the annihilation of the world cuz it's never going to be annihilated right right it's going to be purged right it won't be any more mankind on Earth the world comes to an end under the six seal why because it's purged amen cleansed set aside the world comes to an end not annihilated not what it's going to be not annihilated it's going to be cleansed it's going to destroy the world order okay make an end of sin I man the sixfold purpose right bring in Everlasting righteousness when that Millennium strikes there's never been a world like that be a beautiful place one Isaiah and them saw it let's see something in Isaiah saw too go to number 17 I'm having to jump so forgive me go to number 17 which is actually the scriptures in Isaiah okay Isaiah 65:1 17-25 behold I create new heavens and a new Earth and the former shall be remembered shall not be remembered not come into mine be glad and rejoice forever in that which I create and behold I create Jerusalem and rejoicing in a people of joy and I will rejoice in Jerusalem and joy in my people and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her nor the voice of crying there shall be no more th and infinite days nor an old man that have not filled his days for the child she'll die 100 years old I don't understand that I don't that's a millennium but to S being 100 years old he'll be a cursed they shall build Hab houses and inhabit them and they shall plant Vineyards and eat the fruit of them they shall not build what and another inhabit they shall not plant and another eat for as the days of trees are the days of my and my elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands they shall not labor in vain nor bring forth or trouble for they are the seed of the bless of the Lord and their offspring with them they shall come to pass before they call Our Land and while they are yet speaking I will hear the wolf and the L lamb shall feed together and the lon shall eat straw like a bullet and thust shall be the Serpent's meat they shall not hurt or destroy in my Holy Mountain sayth the Lord that's a millennium right that's a millennium but notice what he said go back up to verse 177 behold I create new Heavens in A New Earth now this is not the future home this is a millennium right if you want that you can go on down to I'll give it minut the future home or at 60 but look going down to number 18 now remember over here it says I create new heavens and earth Isaiah 21 say and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more seed now that's why brother R said it looks like everything is annihilated what is the first Heaven most of you know right cuz you studied the message what is the first Heaven what you saw you have for the first Heaven and the first Earth go to the next one Satan's eating paragraph 167 he talking about descending from God out of Heaven he's talking about the future home right there no more sea the first Heaven and the first Earth was passed away what was our first Heavens was the Millennium Millennium is going to be first Heaven you said the heavens is the sky and I was the first Heaven the Bible was talking about where he said I create Isaiah said I create a new Heaven and a new Earth the millennial Reign is going to be Heaven ruling over Earth what was our first Heavens there a millennium what's the first Earth this now so what's going to happen in the future home in the future home all is going to be made new right because the first Heaven and the first Earth is the millennial Reign and what's taking place right now upon this Earth so he said I create a new Heaven he's going to bring the Millennium into being right right one of these days he going to create a new Earth right not another Earth that's where our minds are Tangled he's going to use this Earth but make it new we're not going to get a new body we're going to get this body redeemed right the world's not going to be blown away it's going to be redeemed proving it because the Millennium can come forth which is the first tell him now brother in the SKU and around and said if I was taken up to the Paul was taken up to the third heaven he said I believe I at least went to the first you need that quote he said Paul said he went to the third he said I at least went to the first so where' brother around go beyond the curtain of time he say well that's up to you you say well did he go in the Millennium it sound like he said he did I know we went beyond the curtain of time now I know whatever is beyond that curtain of time right now where he's at is going to be in the Millennium amen you agree right do when he said I create a new Heaven he made a place for us to go yes he did the millennial rain am the 144,000 going to be in that Millennial rign as Unix to the bride they won't be upset but neither will we be smart eics and the Lord's over will understand and so will they they'll understand then that they turn down the Plan of Redemption but we receiv received it what a wonderful thing to think about that God just didn't leave the world as he does in Isaiah but r c he starts off at the beginning ends up into the millennial Reign but you better remember what he was doing in that speaking of the millennial reign is a type brother said what we'll have in the Millennium won't go into the future home what he say there's going to be some things that won't go into the future home but remember Satan is only bound right for a thousand years I don't understand that where a child she'll die at 100 and a 100y old man will die curse I don't understand that cuz there can't be any death in the millennium come on Satan's bound can't be any death in the Millennium right maybe one of these days the Lord will show us you say well that would be the last year or two that you lived in the Millennium and then they could die this I don't know I just know one thing the Bride of Jesus Christ will experience such a cleansing until she be qualified Amen to go to the Millennium thank you Lord why because of 144,000 are going to be cleansed so cleansed until they be qualified they going to the Millennium we don't have any scripture to prove that point you know what I mean a scripture that says the 144,000 go we got the Scriptures it shows tops and shadows we'll get into this afternoon speaking of it but what about it are we willing to be purged come on Brothers purged of our sins or is God going to have to purchase I remember years many many many probably 40 years ago I preached a sermon I can still remember it persecution why we must have it amen the reason we got to have it is because we won't line up he said well brother D we don't do no that's right we're not at least don't let's don't claim to be a Christian going out living in adul trees and all kind of garbage and drinking and gambling smoking running around don't claim to be bride just be talking about stuff like that but the little foxes is what spoils to mind just start little old sales right let's stand what we got number 16 inp a purging time you will be qualifi God and my heart anybody have a need me oh saor oh my I've always said never care for my wife to know my thoughts as long as she knows all of them but I may think wrong I'm a human are you a human you [Music] WR I don't mind you KN my thoughts

thoughts and ideas that we're cleansed and set a set free but I want to be in that Millennium Lord I want to see a world where there's no sin no sorrow no heartache and a people that are happy yes
