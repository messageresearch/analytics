[3:44] we pray we ask these things in your name
[3:46] Lord God that you'll be with us Amy so
[3:54] let's go to the Book of Ruth chapter 2
[3:57] we'll start at verse 1 and they only out
[4:01] of kinsman of her husband's a mighty man
[4:04] of wealth of the family of Elimelech and
[4:06] his name was Boaz and Ruth the Moabitess
[4:10] said unto Naomi let me now go
[4:12] the field and glean ears of corn after
[4:14] him in whose sight I shall find grace
[4:17] and she said unto her go my daughter and
[4:21] she went and came and gleaned in the
[4:23] field after the Reapers and her hat was
[4:25] to light on a part of the field blowing
[4:27] unto Boaz who was at the kindred of
[4:29] eliminate and behold Boaz came from
[4:32] Bethlehem and said unto the Reapers the
[4:34] Lord be with you and they answered him
[4:35] the Lord bless thee then said Boaz unto
[4:38] his servant that was said over the
[4:40] Reapers whose damsels is this and the
[4:43] servant that was said over the Reapers
[4:45] answered and said it is the MOBOTIX
[4:47] damsel that came back when they only out
[4:49] of the country of Moab and she said I
[4:51] pray you let me glean and gather after
[4:53] the Reapers among the sheaves
[4:55] so she came and hath continued even from
[4:58] the morning until now that she tarried a
[4:59] little in the house then said Boaz unto
[5:03] Ruth here still not my daughter go not
[5:06] to glean in another field neither go
[5:08] from thence but abide here fast by my
[5:11] maidens let thine eyes be on the field
[5:14] that they do read and go thou after them
[5:17] have I not charged the young men that
[5:19] they shall not touch see and when thou
[5:21] art a thirst go unto the vessels and
[5:24] drink of that which the young men have
[5:27] drawn you may be seated the Lord at his
[5:30] wrath blessing to the reading of the
[5:31] word so we've got here a scene that this
[5:36] whole this whole Book of Ruth is in just
[5:39] a few very few chapters and it but
[5:42] there's so much packed into this little
[5:44] short little book because I it's it's a
[5:49] story about really the greatest love
[5:51] story that could ever be you know
[5:54] brother Branham said in in why little
[5:55] Bethlehem in 1958 he said he's talking
[5:59] about talking about the Lord and how it
[6:02] compares the Boaz and everything he said
[6:03] he knows all things and he works it just
[6:05] to be right and there Ruth married Boaz
[6:07] and when Ruth and Boaz was married if we
[6:11] had time to go into the great story
[6:12] there which was one of the greatest love
[6:14] scenes of all ages when Ruth and Boaz
[6:18] were married you think about great at
[6:20] what a great scene for Ruth that
[6:22] somebody that a normal Israelite would
[6:25] not even Rick
[6:26] or just somebody that came out of a fart
[6:28] kind of heathen the MOBOTIX and she came
[6:30] into the land and and and there she was
[6:32] gathering gleaning in the field and Boaz
[6:34] looked at her and and began to fall in
[6:37] love with her as he as he watched her
[6:39] and he began to notice her sincerity and
[6:41] her humility that she was willing to go
[6:44] through whatever it took
[6:46] she was Milton willing to Humble herself
[6:48] and do whatever it took to get a
[6:52] blessing hey you know a lot of times we
[6:56] come to church and we kind of get into a
[6:58] place where we kind of start going
[6:59] through the motions it's just kind of
[7:01] you know it almost comes becomes almost
[7:03] like a routine but really the the
[7:06] purpose the reason that we come to
[7:07] church and the reason that we hear the
[7:09] gospel is because there's a love story
[7:11] that's unfolding and I believe that the
[7:13] preaching of the gospel is not just to
[7:15] not just to maybe just kind of beat the
[7:17] people or to fuss it people over or to
[7:19] maybe you build a minister up or all the
[7:21] different things that you know that go
[7:22] around the world and but but what the
[7:25] preaching of the gospel is for is to get
[7:26] people to fall in love with Jesus Christ
[7:28] you know we say so much about what we
[7:31] try to explain maybe what a revelation
[7:33] is and well what what that means to get
[7:36] a revelation from God but a revelation
[7:38] is really God speaking to you that love
[7:40] language when you read the Bible and but
[7:42] you begin to read between the lines and
[7:44] it begins to unfold you that's God
[7:46] speaking to you that's God's God
[7:48] speaking to you from his love letters
[7:50] this whole book is a love letter from
[7:52] God it's a love letter from the
[7:54] bridegroom to the bride to show you how
[7:56] much he loves you into to unveil secret
[7:59] things secret mysteries to you and show
[8:01] you of himself and so the message the
[8:06] gospel is not just something somebody
[8:07] coming and explaining to you until they
[8:09] can almost kind of beat beat you over
[8:11] the head with a good explanation a good
[8:14] explanation and all of a sudden you
[8:16] become submissive to it you say well
[8:18] they could explain it better than I can
[8:19] and so maybe you know maybe you maybe
[8:23] you have some questions in your mind
[8:25] maybe you come to church with things
[8:27] that you don't understand and maybe some
[8:29] I can just maybe present it to you in a
[8:30] way that just almost brings you
[8:33] into submission but that's that's not
[8:35] what the gospel is about the gospel is a
[8:37] love letter to you the gospel is a
[8:40] revelation is not just education and
[8:44] that's one of the things that one of the
[8:45] very early things that I experienced in
[8:47] my in my Christian walk is you know you
[8:50] could point fingers and say well brother
[8:52] Bob you went to college because I did go
[8:55] to college I went to college and and
[8:56] because of that because of that III know
[8:59] what an education is and what an
[9:01] education brings and I know that this
[9:04] message is not an education you don't
[9:06] get close to God by by being educated
[9:09] into it you've got to you've got to
[9:11] learn the message and you've got to read
[9:12] it and you've got to understand it or
[9:14] something but it's something so far
[9:16] beyond just somebody teaching you like
[9:18] like that like going to college and and
[9:20] and and and explained it's not it's more
[9:24] than just a good explanation it's a love
[9:27] story that's unfolding to you and when
[9:29] you begin to look between the letters of
[9:31] the the letters of the page and begins
[9:34] that love story begins to unfold to you
[9:36] you can begin to see the great
[9:39] mysterious picture of God becoming real
[9:41] before you you think about think about
[9:43] that that story but there brother man
[9:45] I'm told of the the our Lord Meatpacking
[9:48] man that that you know it's a really
[9:49] simple story but there's so much depth
[9:52] packed into that little story of how
[9:54] that that that man he came he came to
[9:56] the ranch where all the girls were
[9:58] decked out and all they were trying to
[9:59] attract me and they were they were
[10:01] decked out in a way that would be
[10:02] attractive to any normal worldly man but
[10:05] this man that came from the armored meat
[10:08] packing company he came and he was
[10:10] looking for something different he
[10:12] wasn't just looking for a world ago a
[10:13] girl with her face all painted up and
[10:16] wearing pants and wearing things of the
[10:18] world and and not busying herself in the
[10:21] kitchen or all those things that go
[10:23] along with being a real good gospel
[10:24] Christian lady but he began to look for
[10:27] character and and I believe in any true
[10:30] man of God will look for character just
[10:32] the same as Jesus came looking for
[10:33] character and and and the character that
[10:36] God is looking for is his old Word made
[10:38] manifest and a bride so when he began to
[10:41] look he began to look for that character
[10:43] when
[10:43] was identified when he identified it in
[10:45] this little girl he came up to her and
[10:47] he began to have a conversation with her
[10:49] and he said I find it and you equality
[10:50] that I want some virtues and you gotta
[10:52] find these virtues and you said I don't
[10:54] see and all these other girls and he
[10:56] began to team it promises to her and
[10:58] brother Branham even talks about in one
[10:59] and one sermon he says he kissed her and
[11:01] he had that kiss that promised to her
[11:03] that I'm gonna come back for you I'll
[11:06] come back for uni and a year and he told
[11:08] her to be looking for him and it was in
[11:10] the evening time that he returned back
[11:12] because brother and talks about how the
[11:13] clock began to she looked on the wall
[11:15] and all the other girls began to make
[11:17] fun of her and the and the clock began
[11:19] to tick down and but she had confidence
[11:23] that he was going to show up
[11:25] she had confidence that he was going to
[11:27] make his appearance and when the clock
[11:28] was it almost looked like timer to run
[11:30] out and as they began to laugh and make
[11:32] fun here come the stagecoach come rump
[11:35] rolling in and I believe tonight we can
[11:37] hear the rumble of the stagecoach come
[11:39] rolling in it's it's it's time it the
[11:41] evening hours at close at hand the light
[11:43] is falling and as the whole world begins
[11:46] to laugh and port mocking and make fun
[11:49] we're we're here for a purpose we have a
[11:51] purpose and we're waiting and watching
[11:53] for his for his appearing because it's
[11:57] it's a love story you see in Philippians
[11:59] chapter 1 verses 9 through 10 it says
[12:02] and this I pray that your love may
[12:03] abound it yet more and more in knowledge
[12:08] and in all judgment that your love may
[12:11] abound your love for God your love for
[12:13] one another may abound yet more and more
[12:16] in knowledge and in all judgment that
[12:18] you may approve things that are
[12:21] excellent that you may be sincere and
[12:23] without the fence and the day of Christ
[12:26] and sincerity is one of the things that
[12:29] we begin to talk about on the way back
[12:30] from the men's meeting and one of the
[12:32] things I want to talk about tonight as
[12:34] we kind of get into this what's this
[12:35] Serie T has to do with with with this
[12:39] journey because it's a relationship and
[12:42] you know whenever when you're entering
[12:43] into a relationship a boy or a girl and
[12:46] any kind of relationship when you're
[12:47] stalking beginning to talk about
[12:49] matrimony it's a serious thing you don't
[12:52] enter into things haphazardly you know
[12:54] the world the world
[12:55] does the world ender internet enters
[12:57] into engagements and things without even
[12:59] given it almost a moment's thought but
[13:02] this is not something for a real
[13:04] Christian person to do is we should you
[13:06] know brother round talked about before
[13:08] you make an investment you should think
[13:10] about what you're investing in you
[13:12] should consider what you're getting
[13:14] yourself into before you take a step you
[13:17] should consider what what where you
[13:20] where that next step is going to lead
[13:22] you what's your final destination is
[13:23] going to be because the gospel brings
[13:28] you the gospel brings you into a
[13:29] personal relationship with God
[13:31] so many times we we want to we come to
[13:34] church and you know what we get we get
[13:36] in love with something else
[13:37] other than Jesus Christ we forget that
[13:40] this picture down here the pictures up
[13:42] here these symbolize what the main
[13:44] things should be that's what the thing
[13:46] is that we should be looking at but
[13:48] instead so many times we will fall in
[13:50] will fall in love with like the ministry
[13:52] I remember one of the ministers meetings
[13:55] a while back a really renowned brother
[14:00] gotta I'm not going to name names or
[14:02] anything because it was a minister's
[14:04] meeting and sometimes those are
[14:05] closed-door things but he began to speak
[14:07] about how you just can't get away from
[14:09] the fact almost sometimes that that when
[14:11] you come to church people are gonna fall
[14:14] in love with the pastor and you
[14:15] understand the way I frame that people
[14:18] fall in love with the ministers they're
[14:19] there to see they're there to fall after
[14:21] a particular kind of ministry or they
[14:23] just get so wrapped up in the way that
[14:25] the particular ministry brings is less
[14:27] than everything that they're just
[14:28] focused so much on that minister and
[14:30] then they lose sight of the main thing
[14:32] and the main thing is Jesus Christ or or
[14:35] maybe they get big is so in love with
[14:37] fellowship that they love being around
[14:39] other other Christians and it's just a
[14:41] wonderful to get into in that
[14:42] environment and get in an atmosphere of
[14:44] just worship and all those kind of
[14:46] things get around other people maybe
[14:48] that can pass out business cards and get
[14:49] a little association get a little thing
[14:51] going and this becomes almost like a
[14:53] club but maybe it may be maybe you know
[14:56] sometimes ministers almost can get to a
[14:58] place where they just kind of get in
[14:59] love with study we like to find new
[15:02] things we get to like to find bring new
[15:04] things out of the Bible and we look to
[15:06] for what way isn't that an interesting
[15:08] thing
[15:08] share that and then maybe begin to build
[15:11] ourselves up and say did you see that
[15:13] before I wonder I wonder if anybody else
[15:15] has seen that before and so we begin to
[15:17] fall in love with that or another thing
[15:19] this is something that I struggled with
[15:21] early on in my Christianity my Christian
[15:23] walk you can begin to fall in love with
[15:25] the anointing and you just want to get
[15:27] in that atmosphere so much you begin to
[15:29] you get where you you want to pray and
[15:30] all those kind of things and you don't
[15:33] you forget what the main thing is the
[15:35] main thing is Jesus Christ we're here
[15:38] not to just fall in love with this
[15:39] ending that routine or not just enjoy
[15:42] each other's fellowship and although
[15:44] those things are good and those things
[15:45] are needful but the main thing is Jesus
[15:48] Christ and it was love it's the whole
[15:51] thing is about love love is what caused
[15:54] Adam Adams love for his wife to go out
[15:57] and try he made an effort to save her
[16:00] and love was what caused him to go out
[16:02] and you see one of the things that kind
[16:04] of greets me is to see people that don't
[16:06] have like man that don't maybe not have
[16:08] a true love for their spouse but women
[16:11] that don't will have a true love for
[16:12] their husband either I feel like that's
[16:13] one of the things that maybe has people
[16:15] have forgotten about this day that we're
[16:17] living in how to really love one another
[16:19] and I believe that you can't really love
[16:21] one another until you have the lover
[16:23] inside of you how can you love one
[16:25] another unless you until you have God on
[16:27] the inside to show you what real true
[16:29] love is because real true love is not
[16:32] expecting something in return
[16:34] love is expect as loving somebody even
[16:37] when they hate your guts love is loving
[16:39] somebody when they don't wash the dishes
[16:41] love is loving somebody when they don't
[16:43] pick up their shoes love is somebody
[16:45] loving somebody when they don't do what
[16:48] you expect them to do that's what real
[16:50] love is if you hear sometimes man
[16:52] they'll say well when my if my wife were
[16:55] to pass away I would quickly go out and
[16:57] get me another one I would replace her
[16:59] why would you why would be destined to
[17:02] make such a remark about my wife don't
[17:05] you have love for your wife don't you
[17:07] have a feeling for her or is it all just
[17:08] based in carnality I wanted to speak
[17:11] playing tonight but I believe that a
[17:13] real Christian should be somebody that
[17:15] knows how to love we should love what
[17:17] another we should love our spouses we
[17:19] should love our children we should
[17:21] because that's what the whole gospel is
[17:23] based on Colossians 3:19 says husbands
[17:26] love your wives and be not bitter
[17:28] against him love one another church
[17:33] brother bring them in the darkest hour
[17:35] then Jesus comes along he said but you
[17:38] see the Bible you'll never learned it in
[17:41] the seminary that might sound awful flat
[17:43] but the Bible said God said he has hid
[17:45] it from the eyes of the wise and prudent
[17:48] and will reveal it to babes such as will
[17:51] learn is that right he will reveal it to
[17:54] babes you don't have to be smart to
[17:57] understand the Bible thank the Lord
[17:58] thank God we don't have to be smart you
[18:01] have to have a humble heart why do you
[18:04] say you have to humble heart because
[18:06] it's a heart condition it's a problem
[18:08] with our heart when we can't be born
[18:10] again it's not God's problem it's our
[18:12] problem that's the problem with our with
[18:14] our hearts too why we can't move up the
[18:16] statue of a perfect man it's a problem
[18:19] with our hearts in our homes why we
[18:21] can't love our spouses
[18:22] while we don't while there's bickering
[18:24] among our home while we're fighting with
[18:25] one another it's a heart problem that's
[18:27] the problem you have to have a humble
[18:30] heart brother Branham said the Bible is
[18:32] God's love story to his church that's
[18:35] hid from all the scholarships in the
[18:38] world it's only knowed by one
[18:40] scholarship that's through nian ology if
[18:44] you ever had any of it you know what I
[18:46] mean down on your knees you have to read
[18:49] between the lines to make it right in
[18:51] other words you can't be educated into
[18:53] it you can't be tall into it and I'm not
[18:56] saying we don't need teachers and all
[18:57] that get get the right train of thought
[18:59] that I'm trying to bring but the way
[19:01] that you'll understand the Bible the way
[19:03] to get a revelation is to fall in love
[19:05] with Jesus Christ and make sure that
[19:07] your heart is right get your heart right
[19:09] be sincere with God come to God with
[19:12] humility come to God with a not lifted
[19:14] up saying you better come the way I
[19:16] wanted or I won't take it at all I came
[19:18] did become and saying that whatever way
[19:20] whatever is necessary I'm gonna do
[19:22] whatever it takes whatever you
[19:25] me to do if you want me to cut in the
[19:26] church every service if you want me to
[19:28] get on my knees until something happens
[19:30] if you want me to do what it whatever it
[19:32] takes if I need to apologize to my
[19:34] brother and if I need to go to them and
[19:36] apologize and affiliate myself in front
[19:39] of them then that's what I'm willing to
[19:40] do Jehovah Jireh in 1962 brother Brennan
[19:45] said now reading the Bible it's a love
[19:47] story that God wrote to his church it's
[19:50] God God is love do you believe that I
[19:52] mean the Bible is written so that the
[19:55] educated and smart can never understand
[19:57] it you have to be in love with God to be
[19:59] able to understand that you have to have
[20:01] God in you he interprets himself to you
[20:04] now it's just like I got a wife oh how I
[20:07] love her I love her with all my heart
[20:09] and I'll be overseas somewhere and
[20:12] she'll after she gets the kiddies to
[20:14] sleep she'll write me a letter and say
[20:16] dear Billy I'm sitting here tonight i'm
[20:18] thinking of you i'm riding seat i know
[20:20] what she's writing on the paper but i
[20:23] know her and love her so much till i
[20:25] just know her nature I know what she
[20:27] means so I can read between the lines
[20:30] see and God wants his church to read
[20:33] between the lines not read anything out
[20:36] of it now you have to read between the
[20:38] lines to see what its meaning now watch
[20:40] and see find out if it isn't now what
[20:43] God done with Abraham and Sarah he's
[20:45] showing them example of his church he
[20:47] did for them he turned them both back to
[20:49] a young man and woman sure he did both
[20:51] in back just like he's going to do every
[20:54] seat of Abraham no matter how old and
[20:56] brokedown you are see what he's doing
[20:58] right now and he begins to talk about
[20:59] Abraham Abraham and Sarah he's reading
[21:02] between the lines because the Bible
[21:05] doesn't say plainly that it turned them
[21:06] back but it does say that that that King
[21:09] down in Egypt he began to won't have a
[21:11] turf or a wife it does say all these
[21:13] different things about the situation and
[21:15] all of a sudden they're able to bear
[21:17] children again so you can read between
[21:19] the lines if you've got that teacher and
[21:21] you know what it's saying and when you
[21:23] begin to read between the lines you can
[21:24] look in the story of Ruth and you begin
[21:27] to pull out things that maybe are not
[21:30] quite apparent like there's three stages
[21:33] in this story when you read the Bible
[21:36] you begin to understand
[21:38] the Bible says things over and over in
[21:40] patterns and when you begin to read the
[21:42] Bible you begin begin to look at those
[21:45] patterns in Scripture and it begins to
[21:46] speak to you about the day and the hour
[21:48] that you're living in it identifies the
[21:50] place in it where you are in your life
[21:53] where you are in your journey that there
[21:55] is a journey all those different things
[21:57] so let's read between the lines this
[21:59] afternoon and look into the story of
[22:01] Ruth and see what it's saying because
[22:03] the story of Ruth says that there's
[22:05] there's three stages here there's Ruth
[22:07] deciding there's Ruth gleaning there's
[22:10] Ruth resting and you remember the last
[22:12] time I was talking about the three
[22:14] stages of justification sanctification
[22:16] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[22:18] there's three stages to a believers
[22:21] journey justification the about
[22:23] sanctification and the baptism of the
[22:25] Holy Ghost and this story starts off
[22:27] with Ruth deciding and I want it tonight
[22:30] maybe get in a little bit deeper because
[22:32] I kind of left everything maybe left you
[22:34] hanging the last time we we stopped in
[22:36] the Holy of Holies in that last that
[22:38] last sermon that I was preaching but
[22:40] there's more to that I read you with
[22:42] that quote where brother Evan said after
[22:43] you get the new birth there's more of
[22:45] that so let's come up a little bit
[22:46] higher let's go a little bit deeper and
[22:48] find out what other things there are
[22:51] what what other things there are besides
[22:53] besides this kind of ground floor level
[22:58] this the story of Ruth starts with with
[23:02] with it a promise and they always
[23:06] telling her making a promise that she
[23:09] would have rest she says in Ruth chapter
[23:12] 1 verse 8 and 9 it says and they only
[23:14] said unto her two daughters-in-law go
[23:16] return each to our mother's house the
[23:19] Lord deal kindly with you as you have
[23:20] dealt with the dead and with me the Lord
[23:23] grant you that you may find rest the
[23:27] Lord grant you that you may find rest
[23:29] each of you in the house of her husband
[23:32] that she kissed him and they lifted her
[23:33] voice and wilt and it came time for Ruth
[23:36] to make a decision she had to make a
[23:37] decision whether or not she was going to
[23:40] go back to the comfort of her what she
[23:42] knew what she was acquainted with or
[23:45] look for that rest you know many times
[23:49] you fight you remember look back
[23:51] in your journey and remember when you
[23:54] first heard that there was a place of
[23:56] rest a place of refuge a place of rest
[24:00] for your soul and and and maybe it took
[24:03] you a while to finally make that
[24:04] decision just like Ruth did she battled
[24:07] back and forth but then she she left off
[24:10] on that journey and she began to follow
[24:12] naomi down into the Promised Land
[24:14] Hebert's for 911 says there remaineth
[24:17] therefore arrest to the people of God
[24:19] for here that is entered into his arrest
[24:21] he also had ceased from his own works as
[24:24] God did from his let us labor therefore
[24:26] to enter into that rest lest any man
[24:29] fall after the same example of unbelief
[24:33] but there's a there are levels to this
[24:36] rest you see because the Bible says in
[24:38] first Thessalonians 5:23 24 and the very
[24:41] God of peace sanctify you wholly and I
[24:44] pray God your whole spirit and soul and
[24:47] body be preserved blameless under the
[24:50] coming of our Lord Jesus Christ faithful
[24:52] as he that calleth you who also will do
[24:55] it and Hebrews 4:12 says for the word of
[24:58] God is quick and powerful and sharper
[25:00] than any two-edged sword piercing even
[25:02] to the dividing asunder of soul and
[25:04] spirit and of the joints and marrow and
[25:07] is a discerner of the thoughts and
[25:08] intents of the heart in other words
[25:10] you've got a soul a spirit and a body to
[25:12] work with there's three things that that
[25:14] God is in the process of bringing to a
[25:17] redemptive state he's already paid the
[25:19] price but the problem is there something
[25:21] in the way of you receiving that
[25:23] redemptive blessing and what it is is
[25:24] your heart your hearts got to be dealt
[25:27] with and first of all he begins to
[25:28] soften up that heart then he gives you a
[25:30] new spirit so that you can deal with
[25:32] yourself and then he gives you his
[25:33] spirit and you're inside of you but then
[25:35] there's still heart problems there's
[25:38] still heart problems that brother
[25:39] Branham preached to us about when he
[25:40] preached the doors and the door of the
[25:42] door to the heart the door don't want
[25:44] all those all those different sermons
[25:45] about there are different things within
[25:48] your heart you have to keep opening open
[25:50] up every door every door of your heart
[25:52] because God doesn't want to just give
[25:54] you the new birth he wants to become
[25:56] have complete dominion over you he wants
[25:59] to be Lord of you he wants to have a
[26:01] polina thority over you he wants to be
[26:03] able to use you in the way that he
[26:05] wanted to use Adam and Eve in the Garden
[26:07] of Eden but the problem is your heart is
[26:10] in the way
[26:11] what what's he doing he's drawing you to
[26:14] oneness of unity to the marriage of the
[26:16] Lamb and I believe I believe tonight
[26:19] that is something to get sincere about
[26:21] if you can catch the revelation of what
[26:23] God wants to do in your life and what
[26:25] God is doing in this age that's
[26:27] something to get this serious about as a
[26:29] young man that wants to propose to a
[26:31] young lady and it's thinking about the
[26:33] type of engagement ring and it's
[26:34] thinking about where he wants to take
[26:36] her to the wedding what kind of home but
[26:38] you know God has thought about all those
[26:40] things too he thought about the proposal
[26:43] he thought about the wedding
[26:44] he planned out the wedding supper and he
[26:46] planned out your home because he's got
[26:48] he said I go to prepare a place for you
[26:50] where I that where I am you may be also
[26:53] and he's got that New Jerusalem prepared
[26:55] brother when I'm said to weigh exactly
[26:57] to your desires to your desires that
[27:00] maybe you don't even know about he's got
[27:02] all that prepared that's something to be
[27:04] sincere about I believe tonight we
[27:06] should be so sincere that we'd be
[27:08] willing to do whatever it took to get
[27:10] there not just the new birth that's not
[27:13] what I'm talking about but I'm talking
[27:15] about adoption you know what tonight I
[27:17] almost titled this sermon the price of
[27:19] adoption because there's a price that
[27:21] you've got to pay and the price of
[27:22] humility the price of is a seer life the
[27:25] price of dying out to yourself that God
[27:28] may have preeminence and you let's go
[27:34] back let's go back to what I was talking
[27:36] about in that last sermon I preached
[27:38] what does that journey from the outer
[27:40] court to the inner court to the Holy of
[27:42] Holies because I stopped in the Holy of
[27:46] Holies but there's more than that your
[27:49] whole journey though is based on what
[27:51] happens at that
[27:51] outer court the atonement is offered the
[27:53] sacrifice is offered do you know when
[27:55] brother Branham was approaching the
[27:57] third pool and he he said he began to
[27:59] have he always had a problem with mark
[28:01] 11:23 oh I think that's the right
[28:04] scripture the scripture that says say to
[28:05] this mountain be moved he always and he
[28:08] said I would preach on that and I would
[28:09] pull back because and he said I even
[28:12] wondered if
[28:13] that was in the atonement he said I
[28:15] don't see that in the atonement or maybe
[28:19] not worded exactly like that but is it
[28:21] in the atonement he wondered is it in
[28:23] the atonement because you see that what
[28:27] happens in that outer court the
[28:29] sacrifice dying Jesus died for you
[28:31] everything is in that atonement but you
[28:33] may not see it it may not be open unto
[28:35] you as you climb up the statue of a
[28:38] perfect man as you agree it grow in
[28:40] grace and knowledge there came one day a
[28:42] realization that scripture opened up to
[28:45] him and he began to realize what that
[28:47] scripture meant that that was in the
[28:49] atonement but you and I have to realize
[28:51] that that scripture is in the atonement
[28:53] it's not my education I can educate you
[28:55] tonight and tell you this in in the
[28:57] atonement but it's a love letter to you
[28:59] that you've got to see for your own self
[29:01] God speaking to you personally this is a
[29:04] personal walk a personal revelation to
[29:07] you you cannot go in based on the Kotel
[29:10] high riding on the coattails of your
[29:12] pastor or of a minister or any man of
[29:14] God or anybody that you see walking this
[29:17] walk you've got to go in personally
[29:19] personally you and God alone there's a
[29:22] love relationship between you and God
[29:24] just you can see when you get when you
[29:30] go into that holy of holies you're there
[29:32] like brother branham compared it to like
[29:34] the bedroom you're in there in that
[29:35] bedroom the receiving seed receiving the
[29:38] word like but but you see like so many
[29:41] creatures today we think we think well I
[29:44] just want to stay in that holy of holy
[29:46] with the curtain closed around
[29:48] I don't want eat it I don't want to go
[29:49] out and like fellowship with anybody I
[29:51] don't want to go and you know there's
[29:52] that there's like this movement this
[29:54] movement that's not just coming on the
[29:56] scene but it's been around for a while
[29:58] now this isolationist thing that that
[30:00] well it's going to be a secret thing a
[30:04] secret catching away so I'll just make
[30:06] it I'll just kind of help God and I'll
[30:08] just isolate myself and people go off
[30:11] and they live alone live by themselves
[30:13] don't come to church and you know that's
[30:15] one thing that's one example of
[30:17] isolationist but you can also do that
[30:19] your own self well you want to just you
[30:21] don't want to fellowship with anybody
[30:22] you and I just kind of keep yourself all
[30:25] alone
[30:26] but you see there's a mystery here a
[30:27] mystery in the Book of Ruth a mystery
[30:29] throughout the Bible that after you come
[30:31] into the Holy of Holies you got to go
[30:33] back out you got to go out to the outer
[30:35] court again you got a and what's
[30:37] happening is your soul doesn't leave
[30:39] that inner court is that the Holy of
[30:41] Holies your soul is still in that Holy
[30:43] of Holies
[30:44] but now God begins to work on your
[30:46] spirit your spirit is in the outer Court
[30:49] and he begins to take you through what
[30:50] three pools of your journey
[30:52] do you see God did not call you to
[30:56] isolate yourself God did not call you to
[30:58] just sit at home and stream but God is
[31:00] calling you to fellowship one with
[31:02] another God is calling you to take what
[31:04] you experienced in that Holy of Holies
[31:06] and bring it out to share with other
[31:08] people because what's going to attract
[31:11] people to the gospel is the fire you are
[31:13] the light of this gospel don't hide that
[31:16] light you are the you are the light to
[31:18] the world you are a light in your church
[31:20] you know you know many of us maybe
[31:23] wonder we come to the realization that
[31:26] when you come to church it's not so that
[31:29] other people can be alike to you but
[31:31] it's so that you can be a light to them
[31:33] now I believe sometimes people want and
[31:36] people want to come to church so that
[31:37] they can have everything their way so
[31:39] that the music can be played their way
[31:41] so that the preacher can preach on their
[31:43] pet scripture so that the preacher can
[31:45] see the things that maybe they've been
[31:46] thinking about about personally dealing
[31:48] with and they want it their way and they
[31:51] want their somebody to be shining the
[31:52] light on their path but the way that it
[31:55] should work is you should come and bring
[31:57] your light you share with other people
[31:58] bring your light and humility and
[32:01] meekness not expecting others to do for
[32:04] you but for you to do with them and then
[32:06] that will have change so when you change
[32:08] your approach to church it'll change
[32:10] your approach to home life let's see see
[32:17] you get to preaching like this and
[32:19] people begin to wonder well what about
[32:20] you bill ah but you see you see I've got
[32:23] to walk this walk to I've got to do this
[32:26] to brother Branham when he when the
[32:28] angel came to him and said you must be
[32:30] more sincere it wasn't that that was the
[32:33] way for him to walk the ministry has to
[32:36] walk more maybe more than us
[32:38] because we not only are speaking it but
[32:40] we've got to walk what we speak we've
[32:43] got we're gonna be held accountable for
[32:44] the words that we say if we just say
[32:46] just vain words just repeating after
[32:48] another what what greater condemnation
[32:50] will befall us but we've got to walk
[32:53] this walk and so I'm preaching to myself
[32:55] tonight I'm not just preaching words
[32:57] just like smack somebody down but I'm
[32:59] preaching I'm preaching a message of
[33:01] deliverance to my own self tonight that
[33:04] I've gotta walk this walk and this is a
[33:06] walk that we're gonna walk it in build
[33:08] in and there's a serie to come to a
[33:10] place where God can bring us to speaking
[33:13] conditions to a play you know that's
[33:16] another thing I think looking back
[33:18] through time you see so many brothers
[33:20] and they almost been getting a race to
[33:22] come to speaking conditions let's see
[33:25] you can get there first why so that we
[33:27] can point fingers at the other and say
[33:28] ah haha look look I'm at a higher place
[33:31] than you that's not how you do it
[33:34] you'll never get you'll never get there
[33:36] trying to be better than the other but
[33:37] you'll get there humbling yourself and
[33:40] lowering yourself down to where God
[33:42] could use you and whether it's a doormat
[33:44] somebody just hold don't hold the door
[33:47] open for people or maybe just actual
[33:49] doormat where people can walk all over
[33:51] you and use you and say hurtful things
[33:53] about you whatever it is let me be the
[33:57] kind of person that God wants me to be
[33:58] in this age that I might fulfill his
[34:00] word the Bible says in Ephesians 4:29 32
[34:07] let no corrupt communication proceed out
[34:08] of your mouth but that which is good to
[34:11] the use of edifying that have administer
[34:13] grace unto the hearers and grieve not
[34:15] the Holy Spirit of God whereby you're
[34:17] sealed unto the day of redemption
[34:19] so you're sealed in that Holy of Holies
[34:21] but you can grieve it your soul is
[34:29] sealed in there but you can grieve it I
[34:34] think that's kind of a mystery maybe
[34:37] maybe something we need to catch on to
[34:40] that they're still there still can be
[34:43] heart problems in your life even after
[34:46] you get the new birth even after the new
[34:50] you get the new
[34:51] if you begin you can begin to fall into
[34:53] that routine and you can just turn into
[34:55] grunt you grumpy old grouch where
[34:58] everybody you just want everybody to do
[34:59] what pleases you and you begin to like
[35:01] brother Brenda said you get to a place
[35:03] where maybe Satan could come along and
[35:05] Crown your life at the end I don't want
[35:07] to be like that I don't want to be like
[35:09] that work where whether brother that
[35:11] brother had talked about that that he
[35:12] got to a place where he just said I'm
[35:14] not gonna serve God anymore being born
[35:17] again he was born again and he went out
[35:19] and began to die to drink alcohol and
[35:21] God had to take him off the scene
[35:23] because because even after you're sealed
[35:25] with the Holy Ghost even after you're
[35:27] born again you can grieve the Holy
[35:30] Spirit you can grieve it what we're
[35:38] supposed to do is climb climb to the
[35:41] tocut what is the token the token is
[35:44] God's wedding ring we're talking about
[35:46] love aren't we the token is God's
[35:48] wedding ring to you it's a sign to you
[35:51] that you will escape death and this our
[35:54] sign is something that was preserved
[35:56] until this age a special revelation that
[35:58] God gave us in this hour what is the
[36:01] token let me point to the token on this
[36:03] chart so that you can see because I want
[36:05] to be real playing the night so that you
[36:06] can see what I mean and if I need
[36:09] correction I'm willing I'm here if I
[36:12] need correction bring it on but the
[36:14] token the token that could make it not
[36:17] receive that token message down through
[36:19] the seven churches because it is the
[36:21] capstone message a special revelation to
[36:23] you a token message was was preserved
[36:26] until this age because if if the token
[36:30] message had been given in any other age
[36:32] they would have taken a body change
[36:33] because that's what the token message is
[36:36] the token life is answer as your you can
[36:39] hold it up like this wedding ring and
[36:41] say it's my right it's my pass out of
[36:43] here it's my pass to escape death and
[36:46] you can step over death with that token
[36:48] when that capstone revelation that will
[36:51] that was given in this age that's what
[36:53] they took it that's what we're climbing
[36:55] to through that wedding ring but Ron
[36:58] said if the Tribulation Period catches
[36:59] the bride his own wife in the
[37:01] tribulation no sir the blood of
[37:03] as Christ has cleansed us from all sin
[37:05] had net wouldn't that reveal under the
[37:07] sixth seal you ain't going in the
[37:09] tribulation and there is no more purify
[37:11] and the blood of Jesus Christ and that
[37:14] token as identification that has been
[37:16] purified I mean that's the token of the
[37:19] Bible wearing wearing the ring but you
[37:22] see see we're getting to a place because
[37:27] after you go through outer core inner
[37:28] core Holy of Holies then you climb you
[37:32] keep climbing and you go out and you
[37:34] continue that process that's what most
[37:36] of the fighting most of the fighting is
[37:38] in that holy place because you're
[37:40] fighting you're trying to keep the lap
[37:42] stems live you're trying to you keep
[37:44] studying you're at that table of
[37:45] shewbread studying as you climb you're
[37:48] you're at that golden altar offering a
[37:50] praise is praying before God confessing
[37:53] confessing your sins confessing what you
[37:55] believe you're saying you're praying
[37:56] like near mine like Ezra did Oh God you
[37:59] get all the walls are down but Lord God
[38:02] you made a way for us and that's what
[38:04] that's what all is going on in this holy
[38:06] place as you're climbing because you you
[38:08] you you're not staying in that holy of
[38:10] Holy's but you're coming out yet and you
[38:12] just keep moving on up I hope I hope
[38:16] this makes sense I hope this is all
[38:19] right mother gramma said it in the angel
[38:22] and the Commission he said this is well
[38:26] coming kind of get into the meat and
[38:28] potatoes of the message when the angel
[38:31] gave him his commission he said he
[38:34] looked at me and he said do not fear for
[38:35] I am sit from the presence of the
[38:37] Almighty God said to tell you that your
[38:39] peculiar birth and life has been to
[38:41] indicate that sure to take a gift of
[38:43] divine healing to the peoples of the
[38:44] world and said now listen if you'll be
[38:48] sincere when you pray and get the people
[38:51] to believe you nothing shall stand
[38:53] before your prayer not even to cancer
[38:58] and then we'll skip on down he said a
[39:00] seventh grade education poor how could I
[39:03] ever feed the world local little Baptist
[39:06] preacher there in the city he said if
[39:09] you'll be sincere when you pray so what
[39:16] I'm really talking about
[39:17] is how how are we supposed to get to
[39:20] this place where we get to speaking
[39:23] conditions how can we get to this place
[39:25] what God can have confidence in us how
[39:28] can we get to the place where God's lips
[39:30] that wedding ring on our finger the
[39:32] token how can we come to the place where
[39:34] he says he's just like the father where
[39:37] the Holy Ghost reports back and he says
[39:38] he's just like you and and you come to a
[39:42] place where God has confidence in you
[39:44] where he's willing to give you the car
[39:46] keys and let you drive a little bit and
[39:48] I believe if we read between the lines a
[39:51] little bit we can begin to look and see
[39:53] what God's requirements are God's
[39:55] requirements he requires us to not be
[39:57] lifted up within ourselves because he
[40:00] said 7th grade education there is
[40:02] meeting this angel and he says he begins
[40:05] to reflect on his qualifications he had
[40:07] none he had no qualification what
[40:09] qualifications do you and I have we're
[40:12] like the Moabite us we have no
[40:13] qualifications we're not great people
[40:16] but we're the poor and the uneducated in
[40:18] there and the off scour of the land we
[40:20] have no great genealogy that we can
[40:22] point back to and say well look at me
[40:24] how great I am
[40:25] he said how could I ever feed the world
[40:26] the local little Baptist preacher there
[40:29] in the city he said if you'll be sincere
[40:31] when you pray because what what did
[40:36] brother Branham stressed so much he said
[40:38] the way up is down and not at a greater
[40:42] witness he said and when you because it
[40:43] can become nothing in your own sight
[40:46] you're becoming something in God's sight
[40:48] then how about that and always remember
[40:51] this friends the way up is down he that
[40:54] exalts himself shall be abased but he
[40:57] that humble himself shall be exalted
[41:00] so just love him with all your heart and
[41:02] forget all you've ever known about all
[41:04] of the things but Jesus Christ just go
[41:07] ahead and love him and work for him
[41:09] serve him if he wants you to be the
[41:11] doormat well you just be the doormat but
[41:14] you see so many times the human
[41:17] condition and the problem with our
[41:20] hearts makes us swell up with pride and
[41:23] makes us want to exalt ourselves and
[41:25] makes us want to know more than the
[41:27] other person we get into situations
[41:29] where we
[41:30] got preachers mocking other preachers we
[41:32] were looking down at one another and
[41:34] people in the church say well I know I
[41:36] know more than that minister I believe
[41:38] that I could know a better way to run
[41:40] things maybe then the pastor I know of
[41:42] maybe a better way to do things on a
[41:44] better way to run run the ship then and
[41:48] we begin to exalt ourselves and we begin
[41:50] to be maybe look at ourselves as the one
[41:52] that maybe others should come to to seek
[41:54] counsel if you all counsel come to me
[41:57] instead of lowering ourselves and saying
[41:59] if I can do anything to help if I can do
[42:02] anything to help then let me let me be
[42:04] there for others you you know brother
[42:11] Brown said husband's should love their
[42:13] wives as God loved the church but you
[42:15] know a wife should come to a place where
[42:18] she comes into a headship she comes unto
[42:21] Authority and the church is supposed to
[42:23] be coming to a place under Authority
[42:26] she's she's coming and humility like
[42:29] Ruth did to boas there where she humbled
[42:32] herself and allowed him to cover her
[42:33] with his skirts allowed him to say I
[42:36] claim you and she came in humility and I
[42:39] think maybe let's get into the home life
[42:42] a little bit let the Holy Ghost meddle a
[42:44] little bit tonight I believe sometimes
[42:46] the problems is we don't we don't allow
[42:48] Christ to have preeminence in our lives
[42:50] and the sisters maybe don't allow don't
[42:53] allow their husband to have them you
[42:55] know that such a problem I know more
[42:57] than my husband and I know more or my
[43:00] husband knows more than the pasture I
[43:03] know more my husband we got if we could
[43:10] just realize that God is the one that we
[43:12] should we should be seeking instruction
[43:14] from what is humility brother Branham
[43:21] said humidity so many times we think
[43:23] humility is just like wearing a skirt
[43:25] and needs to be rode with a skirt like I
[43:28] almost like a I like a CC fire thing
[43:30] like humility is humility is not
[43:32] meekness or not not just humility is not
[43:35] just allowing somebody to run over run
[43:37] over you like that but humility is being
[43:42] when Isaiah he said let's think about
[43:47] all the prophets that said that they can
[43:49] take when they approached God they were
[43:51] in awe of God they were in all of his
[43:53] presence they were their whole motive
[43:57] and objective was in taking care of
[43:59] others not in and having somebody to
[44:01] take care of them but doing for others
[44:03] not for having them to do for you for in
[44:06] putting other people first in Matthew
[44:08] chapter 23 8 to 12 it says but be not
[44:11] called rabbi for one is your master even
[44:14] Christ and all ye are brethren my if we
[44:17] could look at that and the picture like
[44:19] that there were all brethren instead of
[44:21] trying to lord over one another and
[44:23] trying to be the one that provides all
[44:24] of the inside and all of the counsel and
[44:26] having all the information and being
[44:28] able to provide all this or you know
[44:30] putting ourselves above one another he
[44:33] said you know what a rabbi is the way
[44:36] that they call rabbi I looked it up the
[44:38] Jewish terminology for rabbis my great
[44:41] one my honourable sir a title used by
[44:44] the Jews to address their teachers and
[44:46] honor them when not addressing them
[44:48] putting them putting them way up on high
[44:50] on a pedestal and it says and call no
[44:55] man your father upon the earth for one
[44:56] is your father which is in heaven
[44:58] neither be called masters for one is
[45:00] your master even Christ but he that is
[45:02] greatest among you shall be your servant
[45:04] and whosoever shall exalt himself shall
[45:07] be abased and he that shall humble
[45:08] himself shall be exalted to humble
[45:12] yourself means like to set yourself at
[45:14] the last place at the feast like it says
[45:16] in Proverbs to let somebody else put you
[45:18] up verse in Proverbs 1812 it says before
[45:21] destruction the heart of man is holy and
[45:23] before honour is humility in proverbs 22
[45:26] it says by humility and the fear of the
[45:28] Lord are riches and honor and life
[45:31] 1st Peter 5 says likewise ye younger
[45:34] submit yourselves under the elder yea
[45:36] all of you be subject one to another all
[45:39] of you be subject one to another and be
[45:41] clothed with humility for God resisteth
[45:43] the proud and give us grace to the
[45:46] humble oh I like this atmosphere right
[45:49] now it feels like there's a cutting edge
[45:51] a cutting sword everything almost feels
[45:54] a little bit
[45:55] awkward in here that's alright
[45:59] I believe the preaching of the gospel
[46:01] needs to be awkward sometimes
[46:05] Philippians chapter 2 says fulfill you
[46:08] my joy that you make that you be
[46:09] like-minded having the same love being
[46:11] of one Accord of one mind let nothing be
[46:15] done through strife or vainglory but in
[46:17] lowliness of mind and lowliness of mind
[46:20] let each esteem other better than
[46:23] themselves
[46:24] my goodness to come to a place like that
[46:26] do you realize this is a requirement for
[46:28] your brothers and sisters to come to a
[46:30] place where you esteem the other better
[46:32] than yourself you come to a place to
[46:34] where you realize we want what you're
[46:36] lacking and there's nothing good about
[46:37] you but all of it all of its good about
[46:40] you comes from God it's not a holy
[46:42] people but it's a holy God dwelling in
[46:45] the people and that makes them holy
[46:46] that's what Colossians chapter 3 says
[46:49] put on therefore is the elect of God
[46:50] holy and beloved bowels of mercies
[46:53] kindness humbleness of mind meekness
[46:56] long-suffering forbearing one another
[46:58] and forgiving one another if any man
[47:00] have a quarrel against any even as
[47:03] Christ forgave you so also do ye that's
[47:11] the mark of a real Christian a real
[47:13] Christian comes to a place where there
[47:15] says so sincere so sincere that they're
[47:19] ready to humiliate themselves or do
[47:22] whatever it takes
[47:28] I'm brother Branham in 1950 he said he
[47:32] said again I told you people now
[47:33] remember I told you people I said he
[47:35] told me if you'll be sincere see then it
[47:38] will come to pass the you'll tell the
[47:41] people the very secrets of their hearts
[47:43] and the things that they have done in
[47:47] their life that's wrong and so forth if
[47:50] you'll be sincere with what I give if if
[47:55] you'll be sincere then see he didn't his
[47:58] ministry didn't begin with him telling
[48:00] the secrets of people's hearts but there
[48:02] was a place and if you go back and look
[48:05] I was trying to find the quote before I
[48:07] come out couldn't fine
[48:08] he talks about a woman in a gray suit
[48:10] walking up to him and a plat on the
[48:12] platform and all of a sudden he marks
[48:15] the day and the hour see God knows the
[48:17] day everything's moving according to a
[48:20] chronological pattern he knows when
[48:22] things are gonna happen there and
[48:23] there's an actual an actual time and a
[48:26] place when things happen when when
[48:29] there's a time in a place when you got
[48:31] the newark new birth and there'll be a
[48:33] time in a place when we take a body
[48:34] change but he said he looked and he saw
[48:36] that woman in the gray suit began to
[48:38] walk up and all of a sudden he began to
[48:40] tell her he began to know what was in
[48:44] her heart and why did that happen
[48:46] because the angel had told him if you'll
[48:49] be sincere if you'll be sincere with
[48:52] this what I'm giving you now not just
[48:54] run around and make a big show of it not
[48:56] make it like a big magic show or try to
[48:58] build you up your own influence like he
[49:01] saw all the other ones doing all the oil
[49:03] Roberts's and all the different ones
[49:04] that they wanted to build themselves up
[49:06] and build great big followings and all
[49:09] of those kind of things
[49:12] that's what brother Branham said about
[49:14] sincerity and what hairstyle Elisha he
[49:18] said today we could shout we can scream
[49:21] we could speak with tongues have signs
[49:23] and things but where is that sincerity
[49:25] if so sincere about the Word of God and
[49:27] the Church of God until it grieves our
[49:29] heart to see seeing going home and the
[49:34] message all the things he said oh you
[49:36] said that you're taking under the Old
[49:37] Testament brother Branham all right
[49:38] let's take the New Testament the Holy
[49:40] Spirit warns us that in the last days
[49:43] that the church would get away from the
[49:45] sincerity and the faith what does that
[49:49] mean that they just get to where they
[49:51] just come to church and they want to be
[49:53] a big shot they want to come to church
[49:55] and they want to be big maybe they want
[49:57] to be I want to be a minister because I
[49:59] they've got this perception that that
[50:00] minister is a big shot instead of
[50:03] administer as one that ministers to
[50:05] others a minister is one that's lower
[50:08] than the others because he's the one
[50:09] serving the food he's the one coming
[50:11] around with that little conflict over
[50:13] his arm saying can I get you anything is
[50:15] there anything else that you need the
[50:17] one that you call in the middle of the
[50:18] night and wake up like like
[50:20] I've heard people calling their their
[50:21] pastor in the middle of the night mmm I
[50:24] don't know about this pastor but because
[50:25] their dog has fleas and stuff but see
[50:28] that's what a minister does he's there
[50:30] he's there to minister to your needs no
[50:32] matter how silly may be or how
[50:34] far-fetched but he's there to help you
[50:36] not to build himself up I don't know
[50:43] where that came from have a form of
[50:49] godliness but we deny the power that
[50:50] with the right thing having a form of
[50:52] godliness but denying the power thereof
[50:54] yes sir
[50:55] God hates a powerless religion and any
[50:58] religion today that hasn't got Christ in
[51:00] it it's powerless but any religion that
[51:03] Christ in is under his own blood
[51:07] and it's got power in it you say God
[51:09] hates the religion without power he said
[51:12] your solemn feast is a stink I guess he
[51:15] does hate it he said it makes me stink
[51:18] sick thank you I think I read that right
[51:22] it makes me sick oh so let's read a
[51:25] little bit further down there he said
[51:26] God hates powerless religion it's got to
[51:29] have power in it it's got to have
[51:31] sincerity sincerity brings power
[51:38] sincerity brings we're real worship not
[51:42] forms how does sincerity bring we're
[51:45] real worship because if you if God
[51:48] reveals to you what His Word says then
[51:50] you really know how to worship a lot of
[51:54] times people just jump her like Paul
[51:55] said bodily exercise profiteth little
[51:56] just hop it around a lot and running
[51:58] back and forth in the church what does
[52:00] that profit but if you have a revelation
[52:02] of his word and he reveals to you the
[52:05] Grace and the power and the church and
[52:07] all these thing and his word opens you
[52:08] then you know how to worship then you
[52:10] know the correct way to worship that's
[52:12] why sincerity bring his real worship
[52:14] genuine power to worship that you know
[52:17] to know that you've passed from death
[52:19] unto life let's read another one just
[52:22] once more once more Lord 1963 brother
[52:24] Graham said let's stand up on our feet
[52:26] everybody let's skip on down to
[52:28] paragraph 147 drunk on the spirit if the
[52:31] Holy Ghost can just pour into you till
[52:33] your
[52:33] so drunk you forget what your name is do
[52:36] you forget all your doubts get you so
[52:38] drunk on the spirit do you forget your
[52:40] doubts amen the then you can get
[52:42] somewhere with God then the cry wants
[52:46] more goes up from the sincerity and then
[52:52] another one
[52:53] hallelujah filled with the Holy Ghost
[52:55] these drunk on the spirit God's
[52:57] righteousness and holiness and power get
[52:59] you so drunk too you forget who you are
[53:01] you're nothing to begin with remember
[53:03] God wants to come into you once more
[53:05] Lord once more once more the Lord yet so
[53:08] you see the problem is a hard problem
[53:11] the problem of getting up to the
[53:14] adoption is a hard problem the problem
[53:17] of getting the new birth is a hard
[53:18] problem let's let's go to that
[53:20] definition of what sin serious that I
[53:22] pulled off the internet free of this
[53:30] simulation honest honest when you come
[53:34] to God in prayer are you honest did you
[53:37] say there's really something wrong with
[53:39] me god I need some help from you when
[53:41] you come to church are you coming with
[53:43] honest worship or are you just coming
[53:45] just to see so that other people can see
[53:47] the way that you dress and the way that
[53:49] you act are you becoming are you coming
[53:52] with an honest mode of and objective for
[53:54] God to Tabernacle himself inside of you
[53:56] free from adulteration pure a pure heart
[54:01] isn't that what God wants a contrite a
[54:03] pure and a contrite heart a heart that
[54:05] is ready to be molded a heart that God
[54:08] can work with marked by genuineness so
[54:13] now we come to the second stage of
[54:15] Ruth's journey because in Ruth chapter
[54:17] two she's got to come to this place
[54:19] where she's sincere she's coming to a
[54:22] place of sincere worship and Naomi had a
[54:27] kinsman of her husband's a mighty man of
[54:29] wealth of the family of a limo Lake and
[54:31] his name was Boaz
[54:31] an hour to read this to you so I'm gonna
[54:33] jump down to verse 5 this said Boaz
[54:36] under his servant that was said over the
[54:37] Reapers who's damned so is this he
[54:40] noticed somebody coming sincerely he
[54:43] noticed a woman that had humbled herself
[54:46] that had
[54:47] out down that was bowing down picking up
[54:50] the sheaves behind the Reapers she
[54:52] wasn't expecting the Reapers to just put
[54:54] it in her hand to just come over and
[54:56] just lay that's what we do a lot of
[54:58] times when we come to church we wanted
[55:00] it all in just one second we want the
[55:02] preacher just lay years and years of
[55:05] Revelation and a lap all at once and
[55:07] then we'll be able to well then we'll be
[55:09] able to properly evaluate it we think
[55:11] but we've got to humble ourselves and
[55:14] walk behind the Reapers and pick up pick
[55:16] up the little sheaves in a drop a piece
[55:18] at a time because it's labor like like
[55:21] like brother Bisco said when he was
[55:22] speaking of the men's meeting up there
[55:24] he said it could be a lifetime it might
[55:27] be a lifetime of work of picking up
[55:30] little pieces here and there and until
[55:32] it slowly forms a picture a picture of
[55:35] God's grace to you picking up sheaves
[55:38] and she was displaying character the
[55:41] kind of character that would attract a
[55:44] godly man she said I pray you let me
[55:48] glean and gather after the Reapers among
[55:50] the sheaves
[55:51] she didn't come with any demands like
[55:53] Cain did but she kind she came with a
[55:55] humble heart I pray you let me glean and
[55:58] gather and he said let thine eyes be on
[56:01] the field that they do reap and go
[56:03] without after them follow after them and
[56:05] pick up a little a little bit of choice
[56:07] and morsels that they leave brother Rama
[56:09] in the token he said do you realize I
[56:13] was almost seems critical to to kind of
[56:16] look and begin to that wonder where is
[56:18] there any sincerity is there any
[56:20] sincerity in the world today is there
[56:22] any sincerity left in the message or are
[56:25] we just kind of going through the
[56:26] routine until maybe hopefully I hope
[56:29] just based on hope that the bus will
[56:31] pull up one day sincerity is what will
[56:34] take us there he said I was watching
[56:37] this television was kissing catching the
[56:39] face of them coming to the altar kids
[56:41] punching one another he's talking about
[56:42] Billy Brewer one of Billy Graham's
[56:44] campaigns kids punching one another and
[56:46] fighting going along the altar and
[56:48] laughing and cutting up no sincere
[56:50] chewing chewing gum looking all around
[56:52] go right in there and say yes they make
[56:55] a confession and come back out Billy
[56:57] said you can have 30,000 of them in one
[56:59] year's time he ain't
[57:00] thirty left there's no sincerity left
[57:03] there's no more sincere and listen to
[57:06] how he explains this he said their
[57:08] people is not ready to confess they want
[57:11] to pray God you healed me do this or do
[57:13] that do that but when it comes to dying
[57:15] out and confessing your sins and getting
[57:18] right with God
[57:19] it is a sea no more that's the reason we
[57:23] don't see no more healings than what we
[57:25] have that's the reason I'm preaching
[57:27] these things let's get things ready for
[57:30] a healing service you've got to get the
[57:32] thing working first God heals you for
[57:35] its glory and we must be ready for his
[57:38] glory and you know you could you can
[57:41] begin to read a quote like this and like
[57:43] I was saying begin to wonder if there is
[57:45] any sincerity but I'm gonna switch gears
[57:47] for a little second and just speak to
[57:49] the young people that that are called I
[57:51] know many young people in here I caught
[57:53] up wondering if there's anybody sincere
[57:55] in the message today wondering if
[57:57] there's any even anybody even worthy to
[58:00] make a good message spouse and you begin
[58:03] to reason around that in your head you
[58:05] begin to reason well if there ain't
[58:07] nobody in the message because what
[58:09] happens is you go to camps and you see
[58:11] people laughing after people come
[58:12] through the prayer line well they didn't
[58:14] cry after they came through the prayer
[58:15] line and you begin to look at all the
[58:17] different things going on and you begin
[58:19] to wonder you begin to reason is there
[58:21] anybody still left out there there is
[58:24] still somebody left I'll say like like
[58:26] God told Elijah that I still got some
[58:28] preserved I still got some preserved and
[58:31] what you need to do though is you put
[58:33] your faith to work if you got faith
[58:35] enough to be born again faith enough to
[58:37] be saved faith enough to start your car
[58:39] in the morning put your faith to work
[58:41] and go to God and say God I know there's
[58:43] got to be somebody out there for me you
[58:45] bring them to me
[58:46] I'm sincere about it it's time to get
[58:49] sincere and if you're sincere about it
[58:51] there's somebody else out there sincere
[58:53] what we need to do is stop looking at
[58:56] all the other mistakes that people are
[58:57] made around us and say well because
[58:59] somebody some other people that I'm
[59:01] looking at in the church they went out
[59:03] and got a spouse out in the world then
[59:05] maybe I could go do that too
[59:10] look to the words as your example not to
[59:13] the other people listen I've made many
[59:15] mistakes in my life I've done many
[59:18] things wrong but don't look at the
[59:19] mistakes that I made and say well
[59:21] because brother Bob did so-and-so or did
[59:23] something that that gives me an example
[59:25] that gives me a reason but there's
[59:27] you've got a promise in God's word that
[59:29] God is able to imagine let God be your
[59:31] matchmaker God is the best matchmaker
[59:34] that there could be with so many times
[59:36] we try to get ourselves in with our
[59:38] little beauty minds and our reasoning
[59:39] anyway I'll do human faculties and we
[59:42] just messed everything up but what we
[59:44] need to do is like Moses mama when she
[59:46] put him in that basket and set him loose
[59:48] with all the crocodiles and alligators
[59:50] or whatever and said God you take a hold
[59:52] of him if we'll if we can get serious
[59:55] with God like that and get sincere and
[59:57] say God I want the Holy Ghost if other
[1:00:00] people are receiving it it's for me if
[1:00:02] other people can find good spouses and
[1:00:04] so can I thank God you send me somebody
[1:00:06] god will do it I'm a testament of that
[1:00:12] I'm not I'm not gonna get into their
[1:00:14] personal stuff right there but I that is
[1:00:16] my testimony that God is able you put
[1:00:19] you put your faith to work and God will
[1:00:21] bring you somebody that you can be proud
[1:00:23] of that you can love and the messages
[1:00:29] experiences in 1947 brother Branham said
[1:00:35] yeah hey this is the second quote in
[1:00:38] this whole sermon and it sounded like he
[1:00:40] was begins to talk about people
[1:00:42] wondering if he was too sincere about
[1:00:44] what he believed and in the messaging
[1:00:47] experience she said he says that I was
[1:00:50] too sincere about it that I taught
[1:00:52] thought too much on it set my mind on it
[1:00:54] too much said you pray for john doe's
[1:00:56] baby forget about it that's God's
[1:00:58] business to heal it said you just think
[1:01:00] too much sincerely of us said then when
[1:01:02] you do going to cause to have a mental
[1:01:04] collapse my nature is not what more like
[1:01:06] carrying on but I they told me that I'd
[1:01:08] have to forget about the thing I was too
[1:01:11] sincere for them I don't believe you can
[1:01:15] get too sincere about the work of God
[1:01:17] that's right more sincere you are the
[1:01:20] better God can lead you
[1:01:22] how about that the more you sincere you
[1:01:26] are the better God can lead you why
[1:01:29] because it's a heart condition I believe
[1:01:31] we need to get our heart set to where
[1:01:33] we're willing to do whatever God
[1:01:35] requires when we come into the church
[1:01:37] it's not just it just to kind of do
[1:01:39] something just kind of go to a routine
[1:01:40] and and like take our pill when we read
[1:01:43] our Bible with it sometimes we get an
[1:01:44] idea it's like taking a pill well I've
[1:01:46] taken the pill for my day I've taken the
[1:01:49] pill for the day I've taken my
[1:01:50] prescription no you don't read your
[1:01:52] Bible like you're taking a pill you read
[1:01:54] it like a love letter it's not like
[1:01:56] something the doctor you like the
[1:01:57] preacher told you we're gonna read one
[1:01:58] chapter and then you're done you don't
[1:02:01] read that and in this clip well I've
[1:02:03] done my duty for the day it's supposed
[1:02:05] to be a relationship with God you're in
[1:02:08] love with God and that's why you read
[1:02:10] your Bible to begin with that's why we
[1:02:13] preach we preach so hard about you need
[1:02:14] to pray and you need to be even you need
[1:02:16] to fast and all these things but you
[1:02:17] won't faster you won't pray until you
[1:02:19] get in love with God that's what makes
[1:02:21] you come to church that's what makes you
[1:02:22] come to the Bible study that's what
[1:02:24] makes you come to fellowship with other
[1:02:25] believers as your love for God not
[1:02:27] because somebody forced you you can't
[1:02:29] force anybody to be a Christian
[1:02:31] you can't force anybody to - you can't
[1:02:33] force anybody to love you can force your
[1:02:35] daughter to love another man you can't
[1:02:37] force your son to marry another girl you
[1:02:39] can't force people to get together you
[1:02:41] can't force somebody to be a Christian
[1:02:43] you cannot force you cannot force the
[1:02:46] thing it's my love it's not by force you
[1:02:57] see it's a heart problem I'm gonna steal
[1:03:02] this from another preacher that we heard
[1:03:04] on the men's meeting because they got to
[1:03:05] talking about so all week all weekend
[1:03:07] long they were preaching on David and
[1:03:09] Saul and Jonathan and how what is the
[1:03:11] difference between David and Saul and
[1:03:13] Jonathan why would God choose David when
[1:03:17] when he had he had murdered your I'd
[1:03:19] puts it so Joab put him out there and
[1:03:22] then withdraw your troops let him die
[1:03:23] out there and so I can take his wife my
[1:03:25] goodness what an egregious offence what
[1:03:28] a horrible thing what horrible things
[1:03:30] for Abraham to do to to send his wife
[1:03:33] over there into the into the Egyptian
[1:03:35] kings
[1:03:35] house and like just step back from the
[1:03:38] situation it seemed like what horrible
[1:03:40] things why would God favor David over
[1:03:43] Saul who just may be a few offences he
[1:03:46] he didn't he didn't kill the the enemy
[1:03:49] he didn't kill all of them he didn't he
[1:03:51] didn't kill all of the the bleeding of
[1:03:54] the lands the bleeding of the sheet well
[1:03:55] that seemed like a a really nice guy
[1:03:57] doesn't it seems like somebody that
[1:03:59] would be more favorable he it wasn't
[1:04:02] that bad
[1:04:03] what about Jonathan who who never did
[1:04:06] anything wrong he was a good son a good
[1:04:08] a good friend today but a good Christian
[1:04:11] or you know not Christians in the Bible
[1:04:13] because Christ had not come here they
[1:04:14] didn't even know the name Jesus Christ
[1:04:16] but but they were a good follower of in
[1:04:19] the Old Testament a good follower of the
[1:04:21] faith that they believed in why would
[1:04:23] why would Jonathan not have the
[1:04:25] preferred place but you see there's
[1:04:28] there's more to it than just being a
[1:04:30] good person there's a heart condition
[1:04:32] and God said I found and David a heart
[1:04:35] like myself I found it and David David's
[1:04:37] got a heart like mine somebody that that
[1:04:40] like when saw when they begin when Nate
[1:04:42] was Samuel confronted Saul he made all
[1:04:46] these excuses and made all these reasons
[1:04:48] why he wasn't wrong but David when
[1:04:50] confronted by Nathan he quickly admitted
[1:04:52] he was wrong and repented with with
[1:04:54] ashes and tears
[1:04:55] he quickly repeated and what what's the
[1:04:57] difference here the difference is
[1:04:59] sincerity the difference is humility the
[1:05:02] difference is this meekness the the
[1:05:05] capacity to admit when you're wrong I
[1:05:07] won't to do right David now that now
[1:05:10] look see the difference a lot of people
[1:05:12] think this Saul Saul went to hell but
[1:05:14] Saul did not go to hell
[1:05:16] David and Saul were both saved and see
[1:05:20] you see today you've got the same
[1:05:22] situation you can have the born-again
[1:05:25] believer sitting in the church now born
[1:05:28] again but one can go to adoption and the
[1:05:32] other will not because they are not
[1:05:35] sincere with God they just turned it
[1:05:39] into they just turn it into a routine
[1:05:41] they turn it into a place just being
[1:05:43] grouchy with a word or just hanging on
[1:05:46] they're old ideas and not willing to
[1:05:48] admit that the thing that they heard a
[1:05:50] preacher preach about 30 years ago that
[1:05:52] they're not willing to let go of they
[1:05:54] need to they need to let go that to move
[1:05:56] on in Acts chapter Acts chapter 13 verse
[1:06:05] 22 it says and when he had removed him
[1:06:07] II raised up under them David to be
[1:06:08] their king to whom also he gave
[1:06:10] testimony and said I found David the son
[1:06:13] of Jesse a man after my own heart
[1:06:15] we shall fulfill all my will a man after
[1:06:20] my own heart you think about what the
[1:06:23] price of sincerity is the price of a
[1:06:25] sincere walk with God like when Queen
[1:06:29] the Queen of Sheba Sheba heard about
[1:06:30] that heard about Solomon and she she
[1:06:33] paid that price of a long long journey
[1:06:36] on camel backs across the desert months
[1:06:39] and monster knee until finally she got
[1:06:42] word of the word of the hour was you
[1:06:45] talk about Abraham where God told him to
[1:06:47] separate from your kindred to separate
[1:06:49] and go go this would go down to the
[1:06:51] prominent like promised land I'm this
[1:06:53] separate from LOD and then cast out the
[1:06:57] bondwoman cast out Ishmael do you think
[1:07:00] that was easy but he was sincere he was
[1:07:04] willing to do whatever it took that was
[1:07:06] a sincere man of God that was willing to
[1:07:08] to go and offer up Isaac if that's what
[1:07:12] it took to please God because he was
[1:07:14] sincere it wasn't just it wasn't just a
[1:07:17] ritual to him it wasn't just a like some
[1:07:21] of these weaker ones maybe like Saul
[1:07:23] well I just won't kill all the sheep
[1:07:26] maybe maybe if I just don't kill Isaac
[1:07:27] then it'll be all right maybe maybe God
[1:07:31] will bless me in the way that he's
[1:07:33] promised if I just if I just kind of
[1:07:35] find a way to get it get it get by and
[1:07:38] again see I'm not saying you're not born
[1:07:41] again I'm not saying you're not a
[1:07:43] Christian but there's a there's a more
[1:07:45] required of us in this day to take a
[1:07:48] body change I'm talking about we're not
[1:07:51] gonna coach through a body change on a
[1:07:52] flowery bed of ease there is something
[1:07:55] required that is a price that has to be
[1:07:58] the price of your total total
[1:08:01] captivation to the Word of God and what
[1:08:08] sincerity requires is if you have
[1:08:10] something to make right with somebody
[1:08:11] you gotta go make it right James 5:16
[1:08:15] says to confess your faults one to
[1:08:17] another and pray one for another that
[1:08:18] you may be healed the effectual fervent
[1:08:20] prayer of a righteous man availeth much
[1:08:24] don't keep trespasses and sin covered up
[1:08:27] and be honest with God that's what
[1:08:30] sincerity is be sincere with your fellow
[1:08:33] man and be sincere with God be and you
[1:08:36] know a lot of times with we think by our
[1:08:39] own human frailty that we can tell
[1:08:41] whether somebody is sincere with God or
[1:08:44] not sometimes we can but we're not
[1:08:47] pleasing one another
[1:08:48] we're pleasing God God is the evaluator
[1:08:52] of our sincerity God is the one that
[1:08:55] we're trying to please doesn't the
[1:08:57] scripture say study to show thyself
[1:08:58] approved unto God not necessarily under
[1:09:03] man but to God you're trying to get
[1:09:05] God's approval God's approval is the one
[1:09:08] that we wanted you know even when I'm
[1:09:10] standing up behind this pulpit I want to
[1:09:12] I want to present the word in a way that
[1:09:14] is pleasing the brother Dale and and
[1:09:16] that will that will reflect
[1:09:17] appropriately what this church believes
[1:09:19] in but ultimately ultimately every
[1:09:22] ministers charge is to be pleasing to
[1:09:24] God and to preach it and sling it
[1:09:27] wherever it goes with it if it is if it
[1:09:30] is maybe a place that you maybe don't
[1:09:31] want to in your humanists but let it go
[1:09:34] wherever it falls because the Word of
[1:09:36] God will not return void it will have an
[1:09:38] effect and it's not the Word of God is
[1:09:40] not to be preached just to just a baby
[1:09:42] around and not just to just to build up
[1:09:44] popularity and things but the Word of
[1:09:46] God has a purpose that's to bring us
[1:09:50] into the stature of a perfect man in
[1:09:53] Psalms chapter 251 in verse 15 to 17 he
[1:09:56] says O Lord open thou my lips and my
[1:09:58] mouth shall show forth I praise for thou
[1:10:00] desirest not sacrifice else would I give
[1:10:03] it the eldest delight is not in burnt
[1:10:05] offering the sacrifices of God are a
[1:10:07] broken spirit a broken and a contrite
[1:10:10] heart O God
[1:10:11] thou will not despise why because that's
[1:10:15] a heart that God can work with
[1:10:29] let's read a quote brother Brown said in
[1:10:31] joke 1955 he says while she was a
[1:10:33] gleaning in the field directed by the
[1:10:34] holy spirit to go into that field to
[1:10:39] glean then up come bow ass Boaz was a
[1:10:44] representative of Christ for he was the
[1:10:46] Lord of the harvest he was overall the
[1:10:49] harvest and notice as soon as he looked
[1:10:52] out in the field and saw that Gentile
[1:10:53] girl he fell in love with her why she
[1:10:58] was gleaning behind the Reapers that's
[1:11:01] what the church has to do pick up a
[1:11:03] little bit here and a little bit there
[1:11:05] gleaning and here she was and in the
[1:11:08] next paragraph and here she was gleaning
[1:11:10] behind picking up these little gleans
[1:11:11] and the lord of the harvest fell in love
[1:11:14] with her her being an alien what a
[1:11:16] picture my I just love that and then he
[1:11:18] said whose damsel is this and they began
[1:11:22] to speak and said it's the Moabite they
[1:11:25] come in with Naomi and he went out to
[1:11:27] her and spoke peace to her and said
[1:11:28] don't you leave this field God be
[1:11:31] merciful stay put don't be tossed about
[1:11:34] with every wind of doctrine stay in the
[1:11:37] word what what really is the third pool
[1:11:42] what really is the new birth to you when
[1:11:45] you enter into God's rest on the eighth
[1:11:47] day it is your rest it is God it is your
[1:11:50] rest because the the whole redemptive
[1:11:53] work has been accomplished and now you
[1:11:55] can rest and Ruth chapter 3 verse 18
[1:12:00] Naomi says sit still my daughter until
[1:12:03] they all know how the matter were fall
[1:12:06] for the man will not be in rest until he
[1:12:09] have finished the thing of this day the
[1:12:13] bride is entering into her rest a place
[1:12:16] where she she's trusting what God has
[1:12:19] already done for us but but see that
[1:12:23] principle what I'm getting at here is
[1:12:25] the principle of sincerity follows you
[1:12:28] it's what will take you all the way up
[1:12:30] that journey when the angel went brother
[1:12:33] Branham down in there in that in that
[1:12:35] cave or wherever at one time he says a
[1:12:36] cabin I must I'll say cave because I
[1:12:39] can't believe that's where it was in a
[1:12:40] cave that angel came to him and said if
[1:12:42] you'll be sincere then I'll take you to
[1:12:45] the next step and then what happened
[1:12:48] further on in his ministry he had that
[1:12:51] dream of him he said I had a dream and I
[1:12:53] was almost across the river Jordan and
[1:12:55] then he had a vision when he woke up
[1:12:57] from that dream of a snake and he saw
[1:12:59] the snake attacking trying to attack him
[1:13:02] and try the serpent trying to bite him
[1:13:04] and and then it tried to attack his
[1:13:06] friend and he and God instructed him the
[1:13:10] angel instructed him on how to how to
[1:13:11] bind that thing but then after the
[1:13:14] vision concluded he said if you will
[1:13:16] have sincerity if you'll be sincere if I
[1:13:21] can read it and it was in the message to
[1:13:23] paradox where he talks about this he
[1:13:25] said you've been given power to bind him
[1:13:27] the worst irini and I said well God what
[1:13:29] must I do he said there's one thing you
[1:13:32] must do you must be more sincere see you
[1:13:36] must be more sincere now he had already
[1:13:41] he was already sincere because the angel
[1:13:44] had told him to go to the second stage
[1:13:45] of your ministry discernment of the
[1:13:48] thoughts and all those things you must
[1:13:49] be sincere but now it comes time for him
[1:13:52] to be more sincere sincerity is required
[1:13:56] you must be sincere with God for and
[1:14:01] brother Brennan's responses he did he
[1:14:03] didn't say what I feel like I'm sincere
[1:14:05] already but he said well God forgive me
[1:14:08] for my own sincerity and let me have
[1:14:11] sincerity further on down in that
[1:14:15] message he said I looked at the serpent
[1:14:17] and he started towards me and he
[1:14:18] couldn't do it yet and I said Satan in
[1:14:21] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I bind
[1:14:24] you and scroll on down to there other
[1:14:26] the other red text he said so I said
[1:14:28] then Satan that I might know I unbind
[1:14:30] you because he told him you can unbind
[1:14:31] him too and when it did he started
[1:14:33] coming to life again wiggling and I said
[1:14:35] I bind you back in the name of Jesus
[1:14:37] Christ and then when he did that that
[1:14:39] boy said now you must be more sincere
[1:14:41] than what you are to do this in
[1:14:45] paragraph 2 Donny one of that same
[1:14:47] message he said keep scrolling down he
[1:14:49] said he's seen that serpent bound he
[1:14:51] said you have to be more sincere
[1:14:56] paragraph 294 he said that's what I'm
[1:14:58] striving for is more sincere and each
[1:15:03] one coming along this morning I try to
[1:15:04] think if that was my mother
[1:15:07] those women if that was my sister
[1:15:08] sitting back there if that was my arrest
[1:15:11] setting back there or one of my children
[1:15:13] sitting right there what if it was them
[1:15:14] trying to place myself in their position
[1:15:17] to be sincere to be sincere now let's
[1:15:20] let's switch gears for a second and
[1:15:23] let's kind of go into Daniel seven new
[1:15:24] weeks now don't be scared I'm not gonna
[1:15:27] I'm not going to go into times and
[1:15:29] seasons and all these things but when
[1:15:31] you get when you begin to look into Ezra
[1:15:33] and Nehemiah they begin to talk about
[1:15:34] how they came out of Babylon and they're
[1:15:37] entering into rest they're trying to get
[1:15:40] to a place where they can rest because
[1:15:42] what what were the why did the walls
[1:15:43] have to be erected again why did the
[1:15:46] walls have to be rebuilt so they could
[1:15:48] have rest in that city and when Ezra and
[1:15:50] Nehemiah came out of Babylon Ezra Ezra's
[1:15:53] job his role was to restore the correct
[1:15:56] teaching of the Bible
[1:15:58] Nehemiah job was to build up the walls
[1:16:00] and all the other things associated with
[1:16:02] that so that they could enter into that
[1:16:04] rest so they they could enter in and
[1:16:06] they would know what they were talking
[1:16:07] about so that they could have sanctuary
[1:16:11] in inside the walls of the city and
[1:16:13] notes so they would be safe now now you
[1:16:16] get when you begin to read the books of
[1:16:19] Ezra and Nehemiah Ezra and Nehemiah when
[1:16:21] they came out they began to get real
[1:16:23] sincere and so I'm gonna I want to read
[1:16:26] tonight just to kind of close on this
[1:16:29] the prayers of Ezra and Nehemiah to kind
[1:16:31] of illustrate what real sincerity is
[1:16:34] when Ezra and Nehemiah came out of
[1:16:36] Babylon and they began to come to this
[1:16:37] place where where they began to realize
[1:16:39] that the walls needed to be rebuilt that
[1:16:42] the people didn't know what the correct
[1:16:44] doctrine was they were living in sin
[1:16:47] they had they had married themselves to
[1:16:49] false unions and they began to get real
[1:16:51] sincere they began to get like you and I
[1:16:54] should be I believe in this hour so
[1:16:57] let's read in here my chapter 1 verse 1
[1:16:59] through 11 and I'm not going I think
[1:17:03] everybody's doing real good and I
[1:17:04] everybody wait
[1:17:07] praise the Lord Nehemiah chapter 1 verse
[1:17:13] 1 the words of Nehemiah the son of
[1:17:15] Hokulea and it came to pass and the
[1:17:19] month she slew I don't know if I'm
[1:17:22] saying that right in 20th years I was in
[1:17:24] Shushan the palace that Hanani one of my
[1:17:26] brethren came he had certain men of
[1:17:28] Judah and I asked him concerning the
[1:17:29] Jews that had escaped in other words he
[1:17:32] was concerned about his brother I want
[1:17:35] to know about him which were left with
[1:17:38] the captivity concerning Jerusalem and
[1:17:40] they said unto me the remnant that are
[1:17:42] left of the captivity there and the
[1:17:44] promise are in great affliction and
[1:17:46] reproach the wall of Jerusalem also was
[1:17:49] broken down and the gates thereof are
[1:17:51] burned with fire I believe we should be
[1:17:54] like Nehemiah was when he heard this
[1:17:56] words when you when you begin to realize
[1:17:58] that there are false doctrines being
[1:18:01] preached in the message that there are
[1:18:02] people that don't know the day and hour
[1:18:04] that we're living in that there are
[1:18:06] people that are caught up in their sin
[1:18:07] it should affect us I believe like
[1:18:10] Nehemiah was affected because we should
[1:18:12] be so concerned for one another we
[1:18:14] should be concerned about seeing in that
[1:18:16] church we should be concerned about our
[1:18:19] young people we should be concerned
[1:18:20] about our old people we should be
[1:18:22] concerned about the whole thing the
[1:18:24] whole economy of God and it came to pass
[1:18:27] when I heard these words that I sat down
[1:18:31] and wept and mourned certain days and
[1:18:36] fasted and prayed before the God of
[1:18:39] heaven and said I beseech thee O Lord of
[1:18:42] God O Lord God of heaven the great and
[1:18:44] terrible God that keepeth covenant and
[1:18:45] mercy for them that love him and
[1:18:47] observers observe his Commandments let
[1:18:49] down ear now be attentive and eyes open
[1:18:52] that thou may hear the prayer of thy
[1:18:54] servant which I pray before the now day
[1:18:57] and night for the children of Israel thy
[1:18:59] servants and confess the sins of the
[1:19:01] children of Israel which we have sinned
[1:19:03] against thee both I and my father's
[1:19:06] house have sins he's doing like David
[1:19:08] he's a minute he's not blaming it on God
[1:19:11] he's blaming it on himself and on his
[1:19:14] people on the people that he's with we
[1:19:16] are the ones that
[1:19:18] I've seen we have dealt very correctly
[1:19:21] against the and I've not kept my the
[1:19:23] commandments nor the statutes nor the
[1:19:25] judgments which thou commandest our
[1:19:28] servant Moses remember I beseech thee
[1:19:31] that word that thou commandest our
[1:19:32] servant Moses saying if you could
[1:19:34] transgress I will scatter you abroad the
[1:19:36] net among the nations but if you turn
[1:19:38] and he begins to he keeps praying a
[1:19:41] little now down here be attentive but
[1:19:43] but his heart is sincere to God it's
[1:19:45] it's our fault that the wall has been
[1:19:48] torn down it's our fault that the city
[1:19:52] has been burned it's not God's fault and
[1:19:56] so what did he do he rose up and with
[1:19:58] his sword in one hand and with his
[1:20:00] trowel and the other he began to rebuild
[1:20:02] the wall another in other words with
[1:20:05] sincerity of heart he began to do what
[1:20:07] was necessary so that the city could
[1:20:09] have peace the do you see how that fits
[1:20:13] into this after after all after the
[1:20:16] people have come out after all of these
[1:20:18] ages the people have come out not
[1:20:20] knowing what to do but when you hear the
[1:20:23] word of the law and you hear the message
[1:20:25] it's time to do whatever is necessary
[1:20:27] preach the gospel be in and see it a
[1:20:30] season out of season do it would go to
[1:20:32] the fields whatever we need to do to get
[1:20:35] the message out so that the walls can be
[1:20:37] rebuilt let's go to ends benign this is
[1:20:41] a little bit longer I'm gonna close on
[1:20:46] this so don't get worried his Ezra this
[1:20:49] is this scripture is about Ezra finding
[1:20:51] out that the people of God were in false
[1:20:54] union now when these things were done
[1:20:57] the princess came to me saying the
[1:20:59] people of Israel and the priests and the
[1:21:00] Levites have not separated themselves
[1:21:02] from the people of the lands doing
[1:21:04] according to their abominations even of
[1:21:06] the Canaanites the Hittites the Paradise
[1:21:08] from the people of the lands these these
[1:21:12] were followers of God these were not
[1:21:14] just people from from from anywhere
[1:21:16] these were these were I'll say it like
[1:21:18] this these are good Christian people
[1:21:20] these are born-again believers and he
[1:21:23] found out that they had let all that
[1:21:25] their heart had gotten corrupted by all
[1:21:27] this false doctrine it had kicked in and
[1:21:29] that's why Ezra
[1:21:31] such turmoil because he realized that
[1:21:34] these people need to be their doctor
[1:21:35] needed to be restored
[1:21:37] he got sincere about what he believed in
[1:21:39] for they have talked taken of their
[1:21:42] daughters for themselves and for their
[1:21:43] sons so that the holy seed have mingled
[1:21:46] himself why did they do that because
[1:21:48] they didn't know they didn't know that
[1:21:51] it was wrong they had forgotten they had
[1:21:53] been down in Babylon and they've been
[1:21:55] listening to all these Babylon has
[1:21:56] preached and all these things put all
[1:21:57] this corrupt knowledge in their heads
[1:21:59] but when they come out it's time for the
[1:22:01] Word of God to be restored to them and
[1:22:05] when I heard verse three and whether I
[1:22:08] heard this thing I ripped my garment and
[1:22:10] my mantle and plucked off the hair of my
[1:22:12] head and my beard and sat down and
[1:22:15] started and that's a real sincere
[1:22:17] believer right there to be so affected
[1:22:21] by sin in the camp you know sometimes we
[1:22:23] just let stuff happen in our homes and
[1:22:26] let stuff happen in our churches and we
[1:22:28] just let it go by but if you want to
[1:22:30] take a body change it's time to get
[1:22:33] sincere about the Word of God sincere
[1:22:35] enough to where we sit like Ezra and sit
[1:22:38] astonished and he said then it said in
[1:22:41] verse four then we're Istanbul done to
[1:22:42] me that's then we're assembled unto me
[1:22:44] everyone that trembled at the words of
[1:22:47] the God of Israel not everybody was
[1:22:49] assembled only the ones that trembled
[1:22:53] maybe tonight sitting here in this
[1:22:55] congregation there are ones that do not
[1:22:57] tremble but I want to be the ones that
[1:23:00] tremble I want to be the one of the ones
[1:23:02] that's that that's that's serious
[1:23:07] sincere about the Word of God and having
[1:23:10] ripped my garment and my mantle I fell
[1:23:12] upon my knees and spread out my hands
[1:23:14] unto the Lord my God and said oh my god
[1:23:16] I am ashamed and blush to lift up my
[1:23:20] face to thee my god for our iniquities
[1:23:22] are increased over our head and our
[1:23:24] trespasses grown up under the heavens
[1:23:26] since the days of our fathers he's
[1:23:29] looking back to the father just like you
[1:23:33] and I are doing because our faith is
[1:23:35] supposed to be a restoration back to the
[1:23:37] original faith of the fathers and says
[1:23:40] let's go to verse 8 and he says now for
[1:23:42] a little space great grace has been to
[1:23:44] show
[1:23:45] from the Lord our God to leave us a
[1:23:47] remnant to escape and to give us a nail
[1:23:49] in his holy place something permanent
[1:23:51] that I got may lighten our eyes and give
[1:23:54] us a little reviving in our bondage is
[1:23:57] that not what's happening now in this
[1:23:59] day you we've got a road there is a
[1:24:01] revival going on in this bride it is the
[1:24:04] rising of the Sun because we have been
[1:24:06] revived from our bondage just as they
[1:24:09] were revived from their Babylonian
[1:24:11] captivity for we were bummed and yet our
[1:24:13] God have not forsaken us in our bondage
[1:24:16] but hath extended mercy unto us in the
[1:24:18] side of the kings of Persia to give us a
[1:24:20] reviving to set up the house of our God
[1:24:23] and to repair the dedicate desolation is
[1:24:26] thereof and to give us a wall in Judah
[1:24:29] and in Jerusalem and now O God what
[1:24:32] shall we say after this for we have
[1:24:34] forsaken thy commandments which thou
[1:24:36] commanded by thy servants the prophets
[1:24:38] and he goes on and he goes on but Ezra
[1:24:43] and Nehemiah got serious because then in
[1:24:51] the next chapter says they put they put
[1:24:53] away all their wives they got straight
[1:24:55] they did what was required they realized
[1:24:58] that if if Israel realized that people
[1:25:01] could live that way then they were no
[1:25:02] longer conscious of what God what they
[1:25:04] were called out of Babylon for you know
[1:25:07] that's what the message in this hour is
[1:25:08] to do is to awaken our consciousness to
[1:25:10] what our purpose in this life is for
[1:25:13] they were not conscious of what what
[1:25:15] they were called out of Babylon for that
[1:25:17] or that they were offending God greatly
[1:25:20] you see we don't rejoice when we wait
[1:25:23] when we hear of unbelief or false
[1:25:24] doctrine of all those things and I'm
[1:25:27] gonna I'm gonna finish on this so the
[1:25:28] musicians can go ahead and and come
[1:25:30] forward but but see true love is sincere
[1:25:34] when you get up to the captain it's
[1:25:36] sincere because that's what Paul Paul
[1:25:39] illustrated that in the 1st Corinthians
[1:25:40] chapter 13 when he said charity
[1:25:42] suffereth long it's kind charity envieth
[1:25:45] or not it doesn't behave itself unseemly
[1:25:48] it rejoices not an iniquity but rejoices
[1:25:51] and the truth that beareth all things
[1:25:53] believeth all things hopeth all things
[1:25:55] endureth all things and all those things
[1:25:58] become
[1:25:58] because because it's sincere its sincere
[1:26:03] about is honest about what it is it's
[1:26:05] pure it's the truth coming up to the
[1:26:08] capstone and it will finish off our
[1:26:10] story the third stage of this message
[1:26:12] Ruth chapter 4 verse 13 so boaz took
[1:26:14] ruth and she was with his wife and when
[1:26:18] he went into her the Lord gave her
[1:26:19] conception and she bare a son why
[1:26:23] because she was sincere
[1:26:25] she came with sincerity I believe now is
[1:26:29] the time for sincerity if you stand to
[1:26:31] your feet now is the time for sincerity
[1:26:33] we said God expects total surrender
[1:26:37] total honesty total purity and motive
[1:26:42] Amen he loved the Lord tonight let's
[1:26:50] just work at the Lord
