[14:49] but uh
[14:51] it went to like 190 over 110 and
[14:54] it's been fluctuating back and forth so
[14:56] i spent about six hours in the emergency
[14:58] room
[14:59] uh friday and they did ekg they did cat
[15:03] scan found a brain
[15:05] and found a heart so

[15:15] then again yesterday morning i kept
[15:17] feeling bad i've never had this
[15:19] feeling
[15:20] of high blood pressure so
[15:22] i went back yesterday and went to the
[15:25] um
[15:29] the guys down at the fire station we
[15:31] owed them some honey so we took them
[15:32] anyway my blood pressure was 190 over
[15:34] 100 so

[16:19] i'm going to go see my primary physician
[16:21] we do need doctors
[16:23] we still believe in physicians we
[16:25] believe in doctors because of
[16:27] this outside man
[16:29] that we have to live in but that inside
[16:31] man is going to have to speak
[16:34] and say this is enough
[16:37] to the bride of jesus christ that's like

[17:54] amen
[17:55] but christ being coming high priests are
[17:56] good things to come by greater more
[17:59] perfect tabernacle not made with hands
[18:01] that is to say not of this building
[18:02] neither by the blood of goats and calves
[18:04] but by his own blood he entered into
[18:06] once into the holy place having obtained
[18:07] eternal redemption for us
[18:10] amos 3 verse 7 says surely the lord will
[18:12] do nothing but he revealeth his secret
[18:15] unto his servants the prophets the lion
[18:16] hath roared who will not fear the lord
[18:18] has spoken
[18:19] who can but prophesy and we had a
[18:22] prophet come in the end time we know
[18:23] that to tell us these things and thank
[18:25] god for that prophet
[18:27] revelations 11 3 and i will give power
[18:28] to my two witnesses and they shall
[18:30] prophesy a thousand two hundred three
[18:31] score days clothed in sackcloth you may
[18:34] be seated in the warhead and it's
[18:35] blessing now we'll run through this
[18:37] pretty quick
[18:38] and not hold you alone because if you'll
[18:40] just keep pulling those up we'll just
[18:42] keep reading them
[18:43] in matthew 17 verse 10 they asked him
[18:46] and said well what's going to happen
[18:47] when is all these things when is all
[18:49] this end time going to happen remember
[18:50] the three questions that claude was
[18:52] talking about this past sunday
[18:54] boy i got a lot i i
[18:56] smart as i am i got a lot on that sixth
[18:58] sale that i had not seen before and i
[19:00] really enjoyed that maybe i'll be able
[19:02] to convey a little bit of that more to
[19:04] you
[19:05] later on and jesus answered and said he
[19:06] lies truly shall first come and restore
[19:08] all things and we know that malachi 4
[19:10] was our restoring prophet he came to
[19:12] restore all things make all things
[19:15] come up to the standard that it was even
[19:17] in the in the
[19:19] younger days or down when the paul and
[19:21] irenaeus and all the different ones he
[19:23] turned our heart back because during the
[19:25] church ages what happened
[19:28] man got involved
[19:30] man got involved and man said this and
[19:33] man said that
[19:36] took us completely away from the bible
[19:38] give us purgatories and give us things
[19:40] that's not even
[19:42] you know virgin mary that's the mother
[19:44] of god and
[19:45] boy just and then all the way up into
[19:47] the denominations where they took us to
[19:49] another baptism
[19:51] they took us to a three god system
[19:54] you see what they've done to us they
[19:56] took us through all that but now god
[19:57] said i will restore according to joel
[20:00] and according to malachi 4 i will
[20:02] restore saith the lord and we know that
[20:05] that he restored us back not only back
[20:07] to the faith of the fathers
[20:09] not only back to the old testament not
[20:12] old testament the old prophets but he
[20:14] restored us back
[20:18] and give us a message
[20:20] to change our body
[20:23] and i want you to realize that that
[20:24] message was given to change our body
[20:28] what brother claude was talking about
[20:29] the seals and the different things has
[20:30] been opened up
[20:32] i've read a commentary from um
[20:34] dr schofield
[20:36] that's not in his bible he wrote a
[20:38] commentary on on prophets
[20:40] and he hit the nail on the head i mean
[20:42] he told him exactly what we needed a
[20:44] prophet we need not a prophet but we
[20:46] needed the prophets to bring us the word
[20:48] of the lord
[20:50] to bring us back to what back to god
[20:52] read all the old testament saints i'm in
[20:53] jeremiah now reading in the morning in
[20:55] the book of jeremiah and
[20:57] he tells jeremiah go tell them
[21:00] go tell those people what they're doing
[21:02] wrong and tell them to turn back but you
[21:04] know what happened in about the 23rd
[21:06] chapter of jeremiah
[21:07] they rose up to kill him
[21:10] they hated him so much because of what
[21:12] he said
[21:13] they wanted to kill him
[21:15] so you see what that does with us that
[21:17] same spirit's here now it's raised up to
[21:20] try to kill you and me kill our
[21:21] influence not just kill ourselves kill
[21:23] our influence
[21:24] all right so now
[21:26] let's go to
[21:28] luke 17 30.
[21:30] because in the days of the son of man
[21:32] these things will be made known all
[21:34] right let's go to the chart real quick
[21:36] and then we'll go to luke 17 30. i won't
[21:38] read that one on the feast of the
[21:39] trumpets
[21:41] if you'll pull up the chart for us just
[21:42] real quick
[21:46] y'all pray for aaron that he'll get that
[21:47] done and everything will be fixed
[21:50] and
[21:53] we'll hear it go
[21:54] [Music]
[21:56] and we'll feel it cool
[22:00] and you know what i like what scofield
[22:01] says scofield he was talking about
[22:03] god returning to israel and that's what
[22:05] we're going to get into
[22:07] is that these seven church ages right
[22:09] here
[22:10] in daniel 70 weeks it's quotation marks
[22:14] gentiles were inserted
[22:17] 69 weeks were finished they put christ
[22:19] on the cross after the 62nd week right
[22:22] and then we have a
[22:25] parenthesis
[22:26] which is the gentile church but that
[22:28] gentile church got so bad see the white
[22:31] white white black black black the black
[22:33] is darkness the white is light
[22:35] and as someone was preaching the other
[22:36] night you know brother branham is the
[22:38] one that filled that in and gave a
[22:40] little bit of light
[22:41] and that's me and you
[22:43] if not it would be total blackness why
[22:45] but not blackness of death but blackness
[22:48] of
[22:48] what kills you more than anything your
[22:50] doctrine will kill you more than
[22:51] anything well all right so the bride in
[22:54] the seven church ages and i know that's
[22:56] whistling but you know what it's just
[22:58] gonna have to whistle
[22:59] because i like that fan that's why i'm
[23:00] standing right here
[23:02] but that church age is the question mark
[23:05] or quotation mark
[23:07] and then god's going to start dealing
[23:09] with the jews after the rapture of the
[23:11] church is that right
[23:13] and we know that there has to come a
[23:14] resurrection first i'm kind of skipping
[23:16] through a lot of this
[23:17] first thessalonians dead in christ shall
[23:19] rise first first corinthians
[23:22] we shall not sleep but we shall be
[23:24] changed in a moment in the twentieth of
[23:25] an hour we know that we've been through
[23:27] that revelations 4 1.
[23:29] if y'all want to find that that's fine
[23:30] or you can actually just listen just
[23:32] leave it right there and head toward the
[23:34] tribulation period over time bring it
[23:36] over this way a little bit
[23:40] if you bring it over this way i'll
[23:41] continue reading because we've already
[23:42] read these quotes
[23:44] and to save time
[23:45] revelations 4 1 listen we know
[23:47] revelations 4 1 we as the bride go up so
[23:50] we're going up right here
[23:53] we're going up
[23:54] we know that we're going to have a
[23:56] resurrection
[23:57] 40 days we're going to be around here
[24:00] and then we're going in a rapture
[24:02] excuse me and that's only to the
[24:04] born-again believers
[24:06] right
[24:07] not anybody else not the church the
[24:09] church has to go through the tribulation
[24:15] so now matthew 24 21
[24:18] we're looking right here we know
[24:20] what's holding off the tribulation
[24:23] me and you
[24:25] we're holding off the wrath of god
[24:28] and i like what dr schofield said he was
[24:29] talking about this tribulation he said
[24:31] look
[24:33] now this is in 19 early 1900s when
[24:36] schofield was alive he said
[24:38] he said you know he said back then he
[24:39] said when
[24:40] when adam fell when adam and eve
[24:44] fell god in 2000 years later god
[24:47] destroyed the whole world
[24:49] because it was a lawless nobody had the
[24:51] holy ghost it was a lawless generation
[24:54] that had been raised up
[24:56] and they were
[24:57] doing what they wanted to do mary given
[24:59] him marriage and brother brown said just
[25:00] like this age
[25:02] all right so he's doing that
[25:04] so what god do he destroyed it
[25:09] amen so that's what he's going to do now
[25:12] he's going to destroy once the once god
[25:15] takes the holy ghost off the earth the
[25:16] lawlessness of man is going to you think
[25:20] what happened with
[25:21] you you think what happened with the six
[25:23] and a half million jews
[25:27] toothache compared to what's going to
[25:28] happen
[25:30] man's going to have pent up anger the
[25:32] nations are going to have anger against
[25:34] each other that's only being held off
[25:35] because me and you're still here
[25:37] only being held off because we're still
[25:39] here amen
[25:41] so then when we go in the rapture
[25:42] there'll be no holy ghost except for
[25:44] what god going to the jews and then he
[25:47] promised he would protect them
[25:50] amen he promised he would protect them
[25:54] because in matthew 17 now we see that
[25:56] it's moses and elijah but in revelations
[25:59] 11
[26:00] verse 3 and i will give power to my two
[26:02] witnesses and they'll prophesy a
[26:03] thousand two hundred three score days
[26:05] clothed in sackcloth these are the two
[26:07] law of the trees so what are they going
[26:08] to do
[26:11] right here
[26:12] they're going to bring two prophets on
[26:14] the scene
[26:15] according to revelation 4 1 we go in the
[26:16] rapture the bride
[26:18] goes up two prophets revelations 11
[26:21] and it's a three and a half year message
[26:24] to the jews but it does begin the
[26:26] tribulation period when me and you leave
[26:29] when you and i leave this place the
[26:30] tribulation is going to happen
[26:33] it will start over here in the gentile
[26:35] nations because remember
[26:37] god has been dealing with the gentiles
[26:39] during that
[26:43] period of time
[26:45] but when that period of time is closed
[26:46] up and the bride's gone
[26:49] only israel
[26:51] then everything that god's promised in
[26:53] jeremiah isaiah ezekiel and all the
[26:55] different things god's going to actually
[26:57] turn to the jews
[27:00] pull the wall off of their eyes or pull
[27:02] his hand away from their eyes
[27:04] and he's going to start dealing with
[27:05] them exclusively
[27:08] i said exclusively
[27:10] no more gentiles will be saved
[27:12] exclusively he'll be dealing with the
[27:14] now listen
[27:18] the fifth sealed jew of course they're
[27:20] sealed away it's already done then we
[27:23] got a jew that's coming up 144 000. then
[27:26] you've got
[27:27] you've got a foolish virgin and you've
[27:28] got a cup of water in my name that's
[27:30] going to have to go through that
[27:31] tribulation period
[27:33] they're going to have to go through it
[27:34] because they didn't receive the holy
[27:36] ghost because see when the holy ghost
[27:37] leaves
[27:40] the person's going with it
[27:41] the person that's got the holy ghost is
[27:43] going to leave with it amen so
[27:46] if you don't have the holy ghost you
[27:47] have nothing to pull you up it's like
[27:49] brother claude said you're not sealed we
[27:51] got to get sealed down here now the 144
[27:54] 000 they're going to get sealed in the
[27:55] three and a half years of tribulation
[27:57] of the preaching of the two witnesses
[27:59] right
[28:01] they're going to get sealed and get the
[28:02] holy ghost but see the whole rest of the
[28:04] world is not going to be
[28:06] even the
[28:08] even
[28:10] the 10 the virgins they're not going to
[28:12] get the holy ghost
[28:14] they're going to come up with white
[28:15] throne judgment and god's gonna say hey
[28:17] you stood for me i'll stand for you
[28:22] and they'll be what they'll give an
[28:24] account of what they've done and then
[28:25] they'll be judged by that but they were
[28:27] foolish virgins they were virgins all
[28:29] right
[28:30] so now daniel 9 24 tells us and and just
[28:33] hold it right there
[28:34] 70 weeks are determined so the 70 weeks
[28:37] remember it started over here
[28:39] went through the old testament come to
[28:41] jesus
[28:42] then there was that parentheses
[28:44] gap to right here
[28:46] then there's one week left that 69 weeks
[28:48] has already passed there's one week left
[28:51] after the rapture of the church to
[28:53] finish daniel 70 weeks not to not to
[28:56] preach seven years not to have a a full
[28:59] seven year tribulation
[29:01] but it will be a it'll take seven years
[29:03] to transpire all these things of
[29:05] building
[29:06] listen there's got to be a millennium
[29:07] temple belt there's got to be a battle
[29:10] of armageddon that it's not going to be
[29:12] a one-day battle folks
[29:14] it may take a year
[29:16] to kill everybody off the earth but it's
[29:17] going to be an atomic battle atomic
[29:19] explosion and people are going to die
[29:21] because that's when the bible tells us
[29:25] and i hate this but that's what the
[29:27] bible tells us that you'll be standing
[29:29] there and your
[29:30] your flesh will fall off your bone while
[29:32] you're still alive we think we got
[29:34] problems now
[29:35] think about that day
[29:37] think about that time when you call for
[29:40] the rocks and they to fall on you and
[29:41] people that have billions of dollars and
[29:43] they built these big bunkers down in the
[29:46] in the ground and they built this they
[29:47] want to go fly out into space they're
[29:49] not going to make it
[29:52] they're just not going to make it you
[29:54] wish you could go and say look buddy get
[29:57] the new birth
[29:58] there's the ark that you need there's
[30:01] the bunker that you need there's the
[30:02] airplane that you need there's the
[30:04] flying to mars or wherever they want to
[30:06] go that's what you need
[30:10] it's priceless
[30:13] yet you can't buy it
[30:19] priceless but you can't buy
[30:23] thank god for the holy ghost
[30:26] then brother brown tells us
[30:28] in number three just leave that right
[30:30] there because we're going to get to
[30:31] something
[30:32] that moses and elijah will appear
[30:34] and preach jesus christ
[30:36] and the holy spirit took from the
[30:38] gentiles and the rapture comes for the
[30:40] church to be taken up
[30:42] and the jews that's left here will be
[30:43] preached for three and a half years
[30:46] and then the gentiles will be given a
[30:48] place not to repent but they'll be given
[30:50] a place like you got your foot like i
[30:51] said there will be gentiles on the earth
[30:52] that will be given eternal life
[30:54] but not during the
[30:56] tribulation period
[30:58] they'll have to be given they even got
[31:00] to wait past the thousand years that's
[31:02] right because remember only a thousand
[31:04] years is going to be the bride and 144
[31:06] 000.
[31:07] and whatever you want to say about the
[31:08] heathen that comes up i don't understand
[31:10] all that but i know one thing's for sure
[31:14] god promised david he'd have a son
[31:17] sitting on the throne for a thousand
[31:19] years judging the 12 tribes of israel
[31:22] and the gentile bride is going to be
[31:23] sitting there with them with him
[31:26] judging them
[31:28] for a honeymoon
[31:30] and that's us
[31:32] but now what's going to happen down here
[31:34] when we're gone let's back up just a
[31:36] minute revelations 9 27 in the midst of
[31:39] the week he shall cause the sacrifice
[31:41] and oblation to cease for the
[31:42] overspreading of abomination he shall
[31:44] make it desolate they're going to make
[31:47] somebody real mad
[31:49] at the end of that three and a half
[31:50] years
[31:51] at the end of this three and a half
[31:53] years right here
[31:54] we see right here
[31:56] there'll be a three and a half years to
[31:57] the jews and then there's three and a
[31:58] half more years but that three and a
[31:59] half more years won't be any preaching
[32:02] it'll be the battle of armageddon and
[32:03] the purging of the earth
[32:05] and then
[32:06] the jews have got to come back and build
[32:08] a millennial temple
[32:10] all right so they got to build a temple
[32:12] while they're here
[32:13] and while we're still enjoying you say
[32:15] well
[32:16] we're only going to be on a honeymoon
[32:17] three and a half years i've done said
[32:19] before show me that in the bible
[32:23] it only says the married shepherd of the
[32:26] lamb brother branham says we'll be uh
[32:28] enjoying enjoying a three and a half
[32:30] year marriage supper
[32:32] but there's no bible for that
[32:34] listen we're in eternity so it really
[32:36] doesn't matter
[32:37] but to fulfill daniel 70 weeks there's
[32:39] got to have be time here on the earth
[32:42] two witnesses are going to be killed in
[32:44] the middle of this week according to the
[32:46] bible according to revelations 11 says
[32:49] when they shall have finished their
[32:50] testimony the beast that ascended out of
[32:51] the bottomless pit shall make war
[32:53] against them and overcome them and kill
[32:55] them
[32:56] all right
[32:57] and it's gonna they're gonna kill the
[32:58] 144 thousand their bodies are going to
[33:00] lay in the street three and a half days
[33:02] they'll horrible
[33:03] but guess what's going to happen the
[33:05] whole world's going to see them rise
[33:08] because there's another resurrection
[33:10] amen the jews will have a resurrection
[33:12] it'll bring them up out of the ground
[33:14] and they will ascend up to heaven
[33:15] according to verse 12 in a cloud
[33:17] and their enemies beheld them what a
[33:20] great day
[33:22] but remember the world
[33:25] as the gentile world knows they've been
[33:27] going through tribulation way before
[33:28] then
[33:29] but now when now 144 000 leaves with the
[33:32] two witnesses the bible says immediately
[33:34] there's an earthquake
[33:36] immediately there's all these things
[33:38] that are going to happen why because
[33:39] somebody's going to get mad and
[33:40] somebody's going to start dropping bombs
[33:43] and man so there's there's going to be
[33:44] all kind of chaos
[33:46] battle of armageddon
[33:48] will be coming to full force then
[33:50] because listen battleborn beginning
[33:51] don't start when we leave
[33:52] right
[33:54] right that's tribulation period
[33:56] they'll be hunted down and they'll be
[33:57] persecuted i'm talking about the the
[33:59] foolish version and different ones but
[34:01] that's not the battle worm again the
[34:02] battle of armageddon's not going to
[34:03] happen until 144 000 are gone
[34:06] they gotta leave and get out of here all
[34:08] right so because listen they can't be
[34:10] anybody on earth with the holy ghost
[34:12] because that's the wrath of god poured
[34:14] out on the
[34:15] unregenerated
[34:17] so the unregenerated don't have the holy
[34:19] ghost so they're the ones that's going
[34:20] to have to go through this tribulation
[34:23] period and this battle of armageddon
[34:26] when they just start pushing buttons and
[34:27] they just kill as many people as they
[34:29] can
[34:31] let's read this let's go to quote number
[34:33] five and read what the prophet said i
[34:34] like this
[34:39] everybody all right sweating real good
[34:41] okay all right we won't be very long i'm
[34:43] gonna try to cut this short if we have a
[34:44] second service i'm gonna let brother bob
[34:46] speak and then i may just continue
[34:48] wednesday night that's all right hey man
[34:50] we'll see according to what they're
[34:52] doing they're working out here now
[34:53] diligently
[34:54] so if you'll find quote number five for
[34:56] me please
[34:59] [Music]
[35:00] there we go now when he gets the money
[35:02] now who's he this is the antichrist like
[35:04] all right we're in the middle of that
[35:06] last
[35:07] week
[35:09] the prophets the prophets have already
[35:11] finished they're prophesying
[35:13] they've brought in 144 thousand they've
[35:15] all come in
[35:17] they're sealed
[35:19] now when he gets the money all under
[35:21] control then he will break this covenant
[35:23] with the jews now look he's not going to
[35:25] break the covenant with the 144 thousand
[35:29] he never made one with them
[35:31] and they never made one with him
[35:34] right
[35:35] so he ain't talking about the 144
[35:36] thousand of the two witnesses
[35:38] all right he's talking about natural
[35:40] israel that's trying to get the temple
[35:42] built that's trying to get all these
[35:43] things back together the menorah and the
[35:45] ark of the covenant and all these
[35:46] different things
[35:48] as daniel said he would do in the midst
[35:50] of the last half of the 70 weeks of
[35:52] daniel that's that last week
[35:54] and then brother what will he do he will
[35:56] have all the world trade
[35:59] look how much they got of it now
[36:04] they'll have all of it
[36:06] because you know what all the gates and
[36:08] all the different ones with the millions
[36:09] and billions they're going to see that
[36:10] this guy's for real
[36:12] he's got power remember he had
[36:15] he gets power
[36:17] to act like god
[36:19] right so he's gonna be combative with
[36:21] those two witnesses but one he's gonna
[36:23] kill him because
[36:25] of the prophecy of three and a half
[36:27] years
[36:27] right so after that three and a half
[36:29] years over there's no more prophecy to
[36:31] keep the two witnesses alive so he kills
[36:32] them
[36:33] then he raises up and says hey i'm god
[36:36] that's my temple
[36:38] this is my city
[36:40] and i'm your god
[36:43] but now remember what the bible says
[36:45] then god comes down
[36:47] and fights for his people
[36:49] see then brother what will we do we will
[36:51] have all the world he will have the
[36:52] world trade and the commerce a pact with
[36:55] the world
[36:56] because he will hold the wealth of the
[36:58] world completely
[37:00] and during that time them two prophets
[37:02] will rise on the scene and call that 144
[37:04] thousand
[37:05] then what will take place then the mark
[37:07] of the beast of revelations 13 will set
[37:10] in
[37:11] now remember we know it sets in now
[37:13] because it's a mark in your forehead
[37:14] it's it's your ideas it's it's
[37:17] it's the devil inside your brain
[37:19] all right
[37:21] but now look he's going to he's got a
[37:23] head up see he's got to start as a baby
[37:25] and he's got to head up somewhere so
[37:27] he's going to head up
[37:28] right here
[37:30] the mark of the beast will come in that
[37:31] no man can buy or sell except him that
[37:33] has the mark of the beast thank god the
[37:35] church will be enjoying a great three
[37:37] and a half years in glory don't have to
[37:39] go through that
[37:41] like i said before ain't not a great
[37:42] revelation
[37:44] you don't have to deal with that guy
[37:46] he's not going to deceive you
[37:49] but everyone that is deceived will
[37:51] follow that guy
[37:54] everybody right with that
[37:56] all right
[37:58] now let's go to
[38:02] um i'll say let's go back to the chart
[38:04] but let's
[38:06] no let's read these two read revelations
[38:09] 19 6 and then we'll go back to the chart
[38:11] i want to show you something here and i
[38:12] heard as it were the voice of a great
[38:13] multitude the voice of many waters now i
[38:16] skipped over a little bit because you're
[38:17] talking about the battle arm again but i
[38:18] want to show you this
[38:21] this is where we land
[38:24] anybody okay with that i want to show
[38:25] you where we land
[38:27] because you know we're somewhere for
[38:29] that time
[38:31] we're somewhere doesn't matter where
[38:32] we're somewhere doing something else
[38:35] it wouldn't matter if we did come back
[38:37] into this dimension we got glorified
[38:39] bodies we're eternal body spirit and
[38:41] soul what does it matter
[38:43] and i heard it worth a voice of great
[38:44] multitude the voice of many waters is
[38:46] the voice of mighty thunderings saying
[38:47] hallelujah for the lord god omnipotent
[38:49] reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and
[38:51] give honor to him for the marriage of
[38:53] the lamb has come and his wife
[38:56] hath made herself ready
[38:58] and to her was granted that she should
[38:59] be arrayed in fine linen
[39:01] which is what
[39:07] the righteousness of saints and he said
[39:09] unto me right blessed are they which are
[39:11] called unto the marriage supper of the
[39:13] lamb
[39:15] so look like
[39:16] i skipped this one but let's get back to
[39:18] it
[39:20] that's the only real reference that you
[39:21] have of a marriage supper of the lamb
[39:24] it doesn't say three and a half years
[39:25] right
[39:26] but we're gonna what what the whole
[39:28] emphasis is is we're going somewhere
[39:32] to eat
[39:34] at a table
[39:35] with abraham isaac jacob joseph all the
[39:37] different ones
[39:38] a marriage supper of the lamb
[39:40] we're going to sit there
[39:42] well maybe not with them that'll be
[39:44] later on but it'll be just the bride
[39:46] and then that's where the bible says
[39:48] he'll wipe all the tears from our eyes
[39:52] all the former things will pass away
[39:54] what's going to happen in that you say
[39:55] well we've got glorified bodies why
[39:57] would we be crying we're glorified we
[39:58] can cry whenever we want to but it's
[40:00] tears of joy
[40:02] not tears of sadness amen amen
[40:05] you think when you see jesus you're
[40:06] going to be all dry eyed
[40:09] i don't think so
[40:11] i i don't think so
[40:13] but call but they blessed are they which
[40:14] are calling to the matter supper of the
[40:15] lamb and he said unto them look these
[40:17] are the true sayings
[40:19] of god
[40:21] now we're going to get to the battle of
[40:22] armageddon now that's us in the
[40:24] mad supper
[40:26] up here in another dimension now
[40:27] revelation 16 13.
[40:30] and i saw three unclean spirits like
[40:32] frogs but it's kind of strange how
[40:34] brother brown tells us about this
[40:36] how would you know
[40:39] come on how would you know that three
[40:41] unclean spirits like frogs would be a
[40:43] trinitarian doctrine
[40:47] how many of y'all figured that out
[40:48] before you heard it from the prophet
[40:50] that's why god sends us prophets
[40:56] because how could you figure that out
[40:59] came out of the mouth of the dragon and
[41:01] out of the mouth now who did you know
[41:02] who the dragon was
[41:04] who did you know who the beast was
[41:06] who do you know who the false prophet
[41:08] was
[41:08] but brother brown laid it right out for
[41:10] us
[41:12] told us that they are spirits of devils
[41:14] he said that was that trinitarian
[41:16] doctrine that come from the pits of hell
[41:18] amen for they are spirits of devils
[41:21] working miracles which go forth unto the
[41:24] kings of the earth the whole world to
[41:26] gather them together what did i just say
[41:28] he gathers
[41:30] all the wealth
[41:32] he's got all the commerce the people
[41:34] can't buy or sell they got to come to
[41:36] him
[41:38] kings of the earth and of the whole
[41:40] world to gather them to the battle of
[41:42] that great day of god almighty behold
[41:46] i come as a thief blessed is he that
[41:48] watcheth and keeps his garment unless he
[41:50] walked naked and they see his shame and
[41:52] he gathered them together into a place
[41:54] called in the hebrew tongue
[41:56] armageddon now dad's been there before
[41:58] to
[41:59] the valley of megiddo and it's just a
[42:01] big old valley
[42:02] but that's where it's going to end at
[42:04] and that's where they're going to start
[42:05] now listen it won't be that everybody in
[42:07] the world is going to be in that valley
[42:11] but something's going to start in that
[42:13] valley
[42:15] something's going to start in that
[42:16] valley and it's going to go all over the
[42:17] whole world i don't know whether it's
[42:19] going to be the the beast is going to
[42:21] walk down there with the because
[42:22] remember you got 10 kingdoms that pop up
[42:28] during this time and they worship him
[42:31] the beast
[42:32] so you got all that and what is that
[42:34] that's kingdoms according to daniel
[42:37] so you got to have heads of kingdoms
[42:40] what if they had some kind of meeting
[42:41] down in the valley of megiddo and all of
[42:43] a sudden somebody
[42:44] drops a bomb on them
[42:46] well then everybody else is going to
[42:47] start dropping bombs on everybody else
[42:49] all right so it's not going to be while

[43:31] push us up
[43:33] but it's not going to get any better for
[43:35] this world
[43:36] and the seventh angel poured out his
[43:37] violent of the air and became a great
[43:39] voice out of the temple of heaven and
[43:40] from the throne saying what
[43:43] it is done
[43:45] in other words there will be no more
[43:47] people saved
[43:50] 144 000 two witnesses

[44:30] and turned it down
[44:32] so it's all up to them and it's all up
[44:33] to us today
[44:35] and there fell upon a man of great hell
[44:36] out of heaven every stone that weighed a
[44:38] talent

[47:27] fourteenth year after that the city was
[47:29] smitten and the self same day the hand
[47:31] of the lord was upon me and brought me
[47:32] tether
[47:33] and in the visions of god
[47:36] brought he me into the land of israel
[47:38] now where is
[47:40] where are we going to spend our
[47:41] millennium

[47:50] so we're going back to jerusalem
[47:54] the mother of us all
[47:56] now it's going to be the homeland for
[47:58] the jews

[48:01] temple which will be the honeymoon for
[48:03] me and you because listen we're not
[48:05] promised land we're promised the whole
[48:07] world
[48:09] we're promised the whole world
[48:11] we're not promised just a piece of land
[48:13] amen and the vision of god brought me
[48:16] into the land of israel and set me up on
[48:18] a very high mountain by which was as the
[48:20] frame of a city see as a front as a
[48:22] frame of the city on the south
[48:24] and he brought me there and behold there
[48:26] was a man whose appearance was like the
[48:27] appearance of brass what judgment
[48:30] and with a line of flax in his hand and
[48:32] a measuring reed and he stood in the
[48:34] gate
[48:35] brother gary they don't have a
[48:37] laser back then so they had to do it
[48:39] with a line
[48:40] they had to do it with a plummet they
[48:42] had they had to do it with the different
[48:43] things i've done that before yeah before
[48:46] you put the plumber down i've seen you
[48:47] know get a corner and get the point of
[48:49] the corner you kids are going what's he
[48:51] talking about all you gotta do is push a
[48:52] button and it'll tell us what to do
[48:55] well anyway
[48:57] these are measuring tools that was from
[48:59] way back in ezekiel's time okay with a
[49:02] line flax in his hand and a measuring
[49:04] reed and he stood in the gate and the
[49:05] man said unto me son of man behold with
[49:08] thine eyes and hear with thine ears
[49:11] and set thine heart upon all that i
[49:13] shall show thee
[49:14] for to the intent that i might show them
[49:16] unto thee art thou brought hither look
[49:19] declare all that thou see us to the
[49:22] bride
[49:25] oh that's not what that says
[49:28] we're not
[49:29] listen
[49:30] we got a city that's coming down from
[49:32] heaven
[49:33] made without hands
[49:35] this one is going to be made with hands
[49:37] and this one is going to be made by
[49:39] israel
[49:40] all right declare all that thou see us
[49:42] to the house
[49:44] of
[49:45] israel so this is to israel it is and
[49:48] listen you can read it i didn't bring it
[49:50] all but brother brown tells us
[49:52] from ezekiel 40
[49:55] to 44. so you've got three other
[49:57] chapters
[49:58] that gives you the dimensions
[50:01] the rooms
[50:02] the where they're going to place this
[50:04] where they're going to place that now
[50:05] listen me and you have nothing to do
[50:08] with that because we're not promised
[50:10] that kind of a temple this is the temple
[50:13] that god wants in the gentile
[50:14] dispensation but he did
[50:17] tell seventy weeks are determined
[50:19] upon thy people
[50:22] and thy holy city which is jerusalem to
[50:25] rebuild that thing
[50:27] sure they built it by man by the way a
[50:29] long time ago but god's going to rebuild
[50:31] this millennial temple through the jews
[50:34] i believe just to me now this is just me
[50:36] i believe it'll be the 144 thousand
[50:38] it'll build a temple because it will not
[50:39] be me and you
[50:42] because from ezekiel 40 to 44 is the
[50:44] building of that temple so from 41 to 44
[50:49] it's dimensions
[50:51] and listen i i don't want to be i don't
[50:53] want to be irreverent but it was all
[50:55] boring to me to read that
[50:58] because it's not to me
[51:00] but it means something to them
[51:03] every every i mean every square inch
[51:06] means something to a jew and god said
[51:09] hey i like that folks i'm going to let
[51:11] you build that temple
[51:13] and you're going to
[51:15] be in it but guess who is going to
[51:17] anoint that temple
[51:20] coming into the millennium me and you
[51:23] all right everybody got that
[51:25] all right so now look
[51:30] somebody's car's going off
[51:38] let's read the whole quote and then
[51:39] we'll
[51:41] let's not even 11 o'clock yet all right
[51:42] seven read number seven
[51:44] i am sweating up here it's a little bit
[51:46] i can't get that fan over here on this
[51:48] side let me pull it over here
[51:56] see who'd you set on the keys
[52:01] old forward yeah y'all forge there's a
[52:03] forward it's a ford yeah
[52:06] for period
[52:08] all right now 70 weeks of daniel let
[52:10] brother branham explain this and i tried
[52:12] to explain but let him explain this all
[52:13] right
[52:14] now these two prophets what will they do
[52:16] it's moses and elijah they'll rise on
[52:18] the scene they'll tell those jews their
[52:20] mistake
[52:21] and out of that jewish bunch they're now
[52:23] going to be 144 000 god will call these
[52:26] prophets
[52:28] what is it the spirit of elijah off this
[52:29] gentile church we'll just continue right
[52:32] on into that jewish church
[52:34] go right on in and call moses with him
[52:36] all right
[52:40] hallelujah you see it and he'll preach
[52:42] the same message
[52:44] that you're getting
[52:46] pentecostal message to them now remember
[52:48] they don't get
[52:50] they don't get um the son of man
[52:51] ministry
[52:53] so they don't have to know what the
[52:54] seals are listen
[52:55] they're they know what the seals are
[52:57] they read them
[52:59] i mean they're in the old testament but
[53:00] they understand their part
[53:03] of god coming down and doing the things
[53:08] because remember the two prophets of the
[53:09] sixth seal were those those
[53:11] those witnesses over there they know and
[53:13] they teach that to the people right they
[53:16] teach that to the 144 000 you missed it
[53:19] the old testament proved we're going to
[53:21] be standing here today
[53:24] that they rejected the messiah you see
[53:27] it will be the same pentecostal message
[53:28] that these jews will preach right over
[53:30] to them
[53:31] and they'll hate those jews who's they
[53:33] the other jews
[53:37] and they'll hate those jews so bad until
[53:39] they'll kill them and they were hated by
[53:41] all nations because it's going to spread
[53:42] out and in the midst of the week because
[53:45] they had raised up a great power for 144
[53:47] thousand they had the holy ghost and
[53:49] brother you talk about doing miracles
[53:51] they did them
[53:52] they stopped the heavens it didn't rain
[53:54] smote the earth with plagues as often
[53:56] they wanted they give plagues and
[53:57] everything else
[53:58] they'll give them romans a hard way to
[54:00] go now he doesn't mean just rome he
[54:02] means the whole world
[54:03] all right
[54:04] but finally they'll be killed our god is
[54:06] a terrible god when he's angry but
[54:08] remember that's over in the 70th week
[54:10] and the church is in glory
[54:11] the wedding supper is going on yes now
[54:13] notice
[54:14] that's where we seen her coming back to
[54:16] the millennial temple
[54:18] over here at the end of the jewish age
[54:20] the anointed now what's the end of the
[54:22] jewish age
[54:24] not
[54:25] listen not when 144 000 take a rapture
[54:31] remember 70 weeks are determined we've
[54:33] only had 69 and a half once they're
[54:35] killed there's got to be a millennial
[54:37] temple because that's where the city's
[54:39] got to go
[54:40] to my people and the city so during that
[54:43] other three and a half years
[54:46] they're going to build a temple and see
[54:48] it look at the end of the jewish age now
[54:50] see we can't come back until their 70
[54:53] weeks is over see that's according to
[54:55] god god can't come here
[54:59] and go to the jews until we're out of
[55:00] the way boom
[55:02] all right then he comes to them and
[55:05] gives him three and a half year ministry
[55:06] but that's not all of 70 weeks that's 69
[55:09] and a half so he's got to take them out
[55:11] of the way
[55:12] wipe the earth off and then bring
[55:15] somebody back
[55:17] to build that temple
[55:19] then
[55:20] wherever we were
[55:22] we're going to be coming from wherever
[55:24] we were and we're going to
[55:27] land or anoint that temple so watch
[55:31] here he comes right on a white horse now
[55:32] look at the end of the jewish age
[55:35] those followed him on white horses
[55:37] horses powers dressed in white blood or
[55:39] vesture dripped in blood wrote on him
[55:40] the word of god
[55:42] he cometh to mighty conqueror to set up
[55:44] the millennium coming to the temple
[55:46] glory there he meets that hundred and
[55:48] forty four thousand
[55:50] sees with us
[55:52] then he meets the 144 thousand so let's
[55:54] read this
[55:56] let's go back and read
[55:59] revelations 19 11 it's before that i
[56:01] skipped that i'm sorry let's read that
[56:04] ebay all right
[56:06] okay
[56:10] revelations 19 11. and i saw heaven open
[56:13] and behold a white horse and he that
[56:15] said on him was called faithful and true
[56:17] and in righteousness he just judged and
[56:18] made war
[56:20] his eyes were as a flame of fire and on
[56:22] his head were many crowns
[56:25] he had a name written that no man knew
[56:27] but himself and he was clothed with a
[56:29] vesture dipped in blood and his name is
[56:32] called the word of god
[56:33] and the armies which were in heaven
[56:35] followed him upon white horses clothed
[56:37] and fined linen white and clean
[56:39] and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword
[56:41] that with it he should smite the nations
[56:43] and he shall rule them with a rod of
[56:45] iron and treadeth the wine press of the
[56:47] fierceness and wrath of almighty god and
[56:50] he had on his vesture and on his thigh a
[56:52] name written
[56:54] capital king of kings and capital lord
[56:57] of lords in other words it's done
[57:00] it's done it's finished
[57:02] amen we have come to a place to where he
[57:05] wanted us to always be
[57:07] amen because remember it was king
[57:09] of little k-i-n-g-s and lord of little
[57:13] l-o-r-d-s which is god in us
[57:16] separated by sin
[57:18] but being our redeemer he come down and

[57:22] the lord said unto my
[57:24] lord sit here to what
[57:28] your enemy be made your footstool well

[58:37] twelve tribes of israel now who is that
[58:38] the son of member it was son of god son
[58:41] of man
[58:42] son of david amen have i got that
[58:45] son of man came first though and then it
[58:47] was son of god then son of man comes
[58:48] back in the end time in a bride
[58:51] then he lifts off of there and then he
[58:52] becomes the son of david in the
[58:53] millennium to who us no
[58:56] no we're his bride
[58:59] that's my husband
[59:01] but he goes to them
[59:03] as a promise in jeremiah
[59:05] we'll read it next time i preach
[59:07] jeremiah 23 and jeremiah 30. if you want
[59:09] to read those the lord promises there'll
[59:12] always be
[59:14] someone sitting on that throne
[59:16] as the son of david now it's not natural
[59:18] lineage because they some of them went
[59:20] way off but remember who was
[59:22] david's promised son
[59:24] in the spiritual christ
[59:26] all right everybody got that
[59:28] so we'll read that next next time we we
[59:31] come so let's read this one real quick
[59:32] because brother brown puts it all
[59:33] together right here real quick and then
[59:35] we'll be done okay
[59:37] questions and answers 1964.
[59:40] and we'll i don't know what they're
[59:41] doing out here they're working so we'll
[59:43] find out just go ahead and eat a bite
[59:44] it's really cool downstairs and it will
[59:46] be real cool since you've been up here
[59:48] you walk downstairs you'll go man this
[59:50] is great because you know what you're
[59:52] sweating all over the place
[59:54] the church is ending and it's blacked
[59:56] out
[59:58] the bride is called
[1:00:00] and then the question was we have
[1:00:02] already entered into the tribulation
[1:00:03] period no no no
[1:00:06] i wished i could just have more time on
[1:00:08] that sea see the bride when she's taken
[1:00:11] from the church
[1:00:13] the bride
[1:00:15] church goes through tribulation
[1:00:17] bride does not
[1:00:18] but when the bride come out of her my
[1:00:20] people when the bride has come out of
[1:00:22] the church then the church age will
[1:00:24] cease
[1:00:25] laodicea goes into chaos why
[1:00:28] there's no god
[1:00:32] the bride goes to glory you're going to
[1:00:33] say no god there's no god to the gentile
[1:00:37] because listen laodicean church age
[1:00:39] that's not jewish
[1:00:41] that's gentile
[1:00:42] all right
[1:00:43] laodicea goes into chaos the bride goes
[1:00:46] to glory and the tribulation period look
[1:00:48] sets in upon the sleeping virgin for
[1:00:50] three and a half years while israel is
[1:00:53] getting its prophecy look
[1:00:55] then tribulation sets in upon israel so
[1:00:58] there's no way but barring all the
[1:01:01] scriptures that we have
[1:01:03] that tells us that after the three after
[1:01:05] the two witnesses leave that the 70
[1:01:07] weeks of danger's over with there's no
[1:01:08] way
[1:01:10] because after
[1:01:14] then comes the bat look
[1:01:16] then tribulation sets in upon israel why
[1:01:18] their israel is getting their prophecy
[1:01:20] what is prophecy three and a half years
[1:01:22] of two witnesses preaching then they go
[1:01:24] in a rapture
[1:01:26] they're not here for the battle of
[1:01:27] armageddon
[1:01:28] but now he says then tribulation sets in
[1:01:30] upon israel
[1:01:32] and then comes the battle of armageddon
[1:01:34] which destroys all things
[1:01:37] and then the bride returns back with a
[1:01:38] groom for a thousand years the
[1:01:40] millennium reign
[1:01:41] after that comes the white throne
[1:01:43] judgment
[1:01:44] now he missed one in there i mean it's
[1:01:46] the battle of gog and magog we'll cover
[1:01:47] that but he's just showing you what's
[1:01:49] gonna happen he got tribulation
[1:01:52] tribulation on the jews battle of
[1:01:54] armageddon to destroy all things
[1:01:56] then you've got the bride and groom
[1:01:58] returning for a thousand years the
[1:01:59] millennial reign
[1:02:01] and after that comes the white throne
[1:02:02] judgment after that comes the new heaven
[1:02:04] and new earth and the new city coming
[1:02:06] down from god out of heaven eternity and
[1:02:09] time
[1:02:10] blends together
[1:02:12] because time's not over until this
[1:02:13] happens
[1:02:14] time's not over until after the great
[1:02:16] white throne judgment because you know
[1:02:17] what they did their sin in time they're
[1:02:20] going to have to have their judgment in
[1:02:21] time
[1:02:22] amen
[1:02:24] they'll have their judgment down here
[1:02:25] there'll be a white throne judgment that
[1:02:27] you and i do not want to
[1:02:29] ever
[1:02:30] come close to that but if you want to
[1:02:32] read jeremiah chapter 23 and jeremiah
[1:02:35] chapter 30. let's stand our feet
