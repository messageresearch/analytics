[13:18] don't you and
[13:19] we've fought the battle been through
[13:22] great trials and things
[13:23] and come now to the point of
[13:26] ending it all up because we're in we've
[13:29] got to admit we're in the last days i
[13:30] mean that's not
[13:32] not something to say well we don't know
[13:34] about the answer
[13:35] about that but we're in the last days
[13:37] we're winding it all up
[13:38] and we just thank god for the
[13:40] opportunity to know where we're at
[13:42] and what's taking place it's good to see
[13:44] everybody that have sister tootsie back
[13:46] with us
[13:48] you've seen her come up out here you
[13:50] know i mean
[13:51] her legs broke crushed and everything in
[13:53] the book and
[13:54] she hadn't been out just a little bit
[13:56] but we we kept trying to offer her
[13:59] help to come up the thing and
[14:02] and we wound up thinking we were going
[14:04] to have to help sister freda instead of
[14:06] strategy because
[14:08] mr tootsie just walked right straight up
[14:09] that ramp and
[14:11] come right on in and and got everything
[14:14] uh you know inside and she didn't want
[14:16] no help
[14:17] so that's a good way to do it that's a i
[14:19] like to see that i like to see the spunk
[14:22] you know if you you say i'm not gonna
[14:26] just do this i'm gonna
[14:28] get up and go and work on it amen and

[20:42] 11 29 for the gifts
[20:46] and calling of god are without
[20:49] repentance all right now
[20:53] turn over to ephesians 4
[20:57] for the gifts many plural
[21:02] many gifts but only one calling
[21:05] because make your calling and election
[21:07] sure see we're all involved in that
[21:09] but yet we have different gifts
[21:12] you know different gifts in in our doing
[21:16] and we appreciate all of that
[21:17] but we're just trying to cover what
[21:19] those gifts are
[21:20] and then try to relate it down to uh
[21:23] finish it up and i hope we can get far
[21:25] enough to
[21:26] if if not if you listen to last night's
[21:29] uh bible study i mean i'm saying i had a
[21:31] good time i enjoyed it
[21:33] it was good to to be able to sit down
[21:36] and talk and
[21:37] and let you listen and me do all the
[21:40] talking
[21:42] no i tried not to do that but but it
[21:44] just gets hung out so you ain't gonna
[21:46] sit there and say
[21:46] all right who's next well 45 minutes
[21:49] later who's next now we're going to do
[21:50] something
[21:51] if we have to get up and dance or do
[21:53] something we're going to do something
[21:54] for a time instead of just
[21:56] sitting there dead and and all of that
[21:58] and just have a good time
[21:59] fellowshipping together is what i like
[22:03] it's wonderful for all of us to be able
[22:04] to come into the building
[22:06] and just sit down and just have a good
[22:08] time i thoroughly enjoyed that
[22:10] and we just pray the lord would bless
[22:12] okay let's go to
[22:13] ephesians 4
[22:17] but unto every one of us is given grace
[22:21] according to the measure of the gift of
[22:23] christ
[22:25] all right wherefore he saith
[22:28] when he ascended up on high he led
[22:30] captivity captive
[22:32] and gave gifts unto men now that's
[22:35] psalms
[22:36] 68 verse 18
[22:39] that says almost verbatim word
[22:43] the same there because it was a from
[22:45] back there
[22:46] promising looking forward to the new
[22:49] testament
[22:50] and paul picks that up in his is telling
[22:53] you that what it all about
[22:55] and he relates back to that and says
[22:58] well now this is what the word is saying
[22:59] back there so
[23:00] wherefore he saith when he led when he
[23:03] ascended up on high
[23:04] and led captivity captain gave gifts
[23:06] unto men
[23:08] now that he ascended what is it but that
[23:11] he also descended first into the lower
[23:13] parts of the earth
[23:15] he that descended is the same also that
[23:17] ascended
[23:18] up far above all heavens that he might
[23:21] feel all
[23:22] things and he gave his the gifts he gave
[23:26] gifts he ascended he brought the gifts
[23:29] the ascending and descending brought to
[23:32] pass the part
[23:33] of the gifts could come into being of
[23:35] the holy ghost coming on the day of
[23:36] pentecost
[23:37] the gift of the baptism of the holy
[23:38] ghost and the gifts and things etcetera
[23:41] as we try to cover
[23:43] all right so he gave some apostles and
[23:46] some pastors
[23:47] i mean it's been prophets and some
[23:49] evangelists and some pastors
[23:51] and teachers for the perfecting of the
[23:53] saints for the work of the ministry for
[23:55] the edifying
[23:57] of the body of christ till we all come
[24:00] in the unity how long is this to be till
[24:03] we all
[24:04] come in the unity of the faith and of
[24:06] the knowledge of the son of god
[24:09] unto a perfect man unto the measure of
[24:12] the stature
[24:14] of the fullness of christ let's stop
[24:16] right there and just you may be seated
[24:18] and we'll pick up because while you're
[24:19] being seated i want to go to
[24:22] uh one more scripture
[24:25] that uh you know
[24:29] see it says over here that he gave some
[24:31] apostles some prophets
[24:33] some apostles some prophets some
[24:35] evangelists some pastors and teachers
[24:38] all right now my point of emphasis to
[24:40] you now for your look if you won't do i
[24:42] don't have this for them
[24:43] but if they want to grab it and see if
[24:44] they can get it up but would be
[24:46] in the the corinthians
[24:50] uh let's see 1228.
[24:54] and what i want you to get out of this
[24:56] point is
[24:58] that he's not laying in order
[25:02] which one is greater than the other
[25:06] he's not saying here in the things that
[25:09] you could say well now wait a minute
[25:11] it says apostles first
[25:14] well that may be over and i think that's
[25:16] right same in corinthians it says at
[25:18] first
[25:18] all right but he's not necessarily
[25:22] making a
[25:22] definite statement of which comes first
[25:26] because i don't believe now i'm as
[25:28] straight as i can be
[25:30] i don't believe that there's any
[25:32] difference in the
[25:33] ministry in the body of christ now i'm
[25:35] talking about the fifo ministry
[25:37] one is not greater than the other now it
[25:40] may be that one brings the word
[25:42] in a greater measure but so what
[25:45] as long as we get it the main thing is
[25:48] us to get it the main thing is for us to
[25:50] to come to a position of understanding
[25:52] and that's what we read in ephesians
[25:55] till we all come to the unity
[25:58] and you go over in peter in the statue
[26:00] of a perfect man
[26:01] but see it doesn't use the word stature
[26:05] but i can read it don't you paul picks
[26:07] it up here and he lays it into a growth
[26:10] development
[26:11] understanding unto the measure of the
[26:14] stature
[26:15] of the fullness of christ seeing he he
[26:18] brings that into order
[26:19] but now let's look at first corinthians
[26:21] 12 28.
[26:27] let's see if i can get it right all
[26:29] right now 27. now
[26:31] ye are the body of christ and members in
[26:35] particular
[26:36] and god has set some in the church
[26:40] now he said it in the church
[26:43] we're going to read a lot today uh
[26:45] irregardless of whatever we're going to
[26:46] read a lot where brother branham talks
[26:48] about
[26:49] that the fifo ministry is the
[26:53] offices
[26:56] offices of the holy spirit
[27:00] see then that way one's not no more
[27:02] valuable than the other
[27:05] one is just as important as the other
[27:09] all right but think about it now
[27:14] and god has set some in the church
[27:17] now who said it in the church he says
[27:20] over here
[27:21] that he gave some apostle some prophet
[27:23] some pastor some teacher
[27:25] okay and god has set
[27:28] some in the church first apostles
[27:32] secondary prophets thirdly teachers now
[27:35] watch him
[27:37] that's not a threefold ministry you know
[27:39] what i'm saying it's a fifo ministry
[27:41] but he doesn't name the other two but he
[27:43] names them why because he says
[27:47] early teachers after that
[27:51] after one two three then you've got
[27:54] miracles then gifts of healings
[27:56] governments
[27:58] diversities of tongues but he said are
[28:01] all
[28:02] apostles or all prophets or all teachers
[28:05] or all workers of
[28:06] miracles have all the gift of healing do
[28:10] all speak with tongues do all
[28:11] interpret but he said covet earnestly
[28:15] the best gift
[28:17] that you show shall yet show i unto you
[28:21] a more excellent
[28:23] way what if it's in jesus christ
[28:27] all right now so what we've been doing
[28:30] and
[28:31] and i'm sorry but i found out a long
[28:33] time ago to quit being sorry for
[28:35] changing your message and bring it
[28:37] because it's always something
[28:39] there and and i've had the last couple
[28:41] of services we've had
[28:42] company coming and going in and we love
[28:45] that i'm not saying nothing
[28:47] i say that it gives an opportunity i say
[28:50] they were sent
[28:53] to make me back up and relate again
[28:58] something that you that was here
[29:02] didn't get it now that's as serious as i
[29:06] can because i've watched that for
[29:08] for 50 years in the ministry so you you
[29:11] come in you've got a
[29:12] preacher and he comes up and he's
[29:13] struggling in a message he's struggling
[29:15] like everything
[29:16] and and man he said man
[29:20] i tell you what i don't know where's
[29:21] anybody getting anything out of what's
[29:23] saying today because i ain't getting
[29:24] much to myself
[29:26] you know but then you go outside and
[29:29] somebody says
[29:30] i caught something
[29:33] well you know what what you said well
[29:36] lord i would have loved to come out with
[29:38] that great glorious anointing that i had
[29:40] the week before
[29:41] you know that i could run the aisles and
[29:42] i can do but this one just seems to be
[29:44] dead
[29:47] well it might be god is using that
[29:52] to make it work any way that it's done
[29:56] we honor glory to the gift gallery to
[29:58] god
[29:59] who does all of this so all right now
[30:02] you understand what i'm saying then
[30:04] see paul to the corinthians
[30:08] there were some of them arguing who was
[30:09] best who was first
[30:12] they must have been because he said now
[30:14] are all apostles or all this or all that
[30:17] but he just simply names off to you
[30:20] apostles
[30:22] prophets teachers he doesn't go
[30:25] excuse me he doesn't go in and call
[30:29] the pastor you know and all like that
[30:34] but yet he does because he says and
[30:36] helps and governments and
[30:38] and this and that and the other he's
[30:40] naming those gifts
[30:42] but he's not doing it into one after the
[30:45] other
[30:45] we want to argue yes but brother dale i
[30:48] found over here
[30:49] because you're always saying this is and
[30:51] i found over here where the bible says
[30:52] it well praise god
[30:56] but does that make anything out of it
[31:00] you know paul is express expressing
[31:07] what we have need of is all of those
[31:09] gifts
[31:11] all right and i believe fully in a
[31:13] five-fold ministry
[31:15] i don't believe in a one-fold i don't
[31:17] believe in a four-fold
[31:18] or a three or two but as wade was
[31:21] bringing out
[31:22] there the other day of frank you know
[31:25] the brother branham come i've always
[31:28] taught you that
[31:29] brother branham came as we would call it
[31:31] outside of the fifo ministry
[31:34] not outside that he was somewhere else
[31:36] no he could fulfill
[31:37] all of those ministries anything of the
[31:41] fifo ministry
[31:42] brother branham could fulfill that
[31:45] because he was
[31:46] the prophet of malachi 4 luke 17 30
[31:48] revelation 10 said
[31:50] you said well you don't think i can do
[31:51] that but around no i don't worry about
[31:53] it
[31:54] i know you can't i know i can't
[32:00] quit trying to be something that you're
[32:02] not just be what you are
[32:05] and it'll fit right into the body of
[32:07] christ and everything will be perfect
[32:09] all right what's been our goal so far
[32:11] what we've been talking about
[32:14] paul said the gifts and calling of god
[32:18] are without repentance
[32:22] the prophet said you don't repent to get
[32:24] a gift
[32:26] you remember what he said the first
[32:28] thing he remembered at 18 months
[32:31] i don't remember what i'd done until i
[32:34] was four or five years old
[32:35] how about you any of you remember
[32:39] anything that happened when you was 18
[32:40] months old
[32:43] he i think i'm pretty sure that's 18
[32:45] there's an amount of months right there
[32:49] he said first thing he remembered was a
[32:50] vision
[32:52] he was crawling across the floor picking
[32:54] snow
[32:55] off of somebody's shoe that had walked
[32:57] in and he saw the point about the bridge
[32:59] of following the things you know when
[33:01] they're arguing
[33:04] you see prophets are born
[33:08] prophets
[33:11] moses was born with a special gift
[33:14] brother brown said he had the word from
[33:15] his youth
[33:17] why because his mother taught him you
[33:20] are not the son of pharaoh's daughter
[33:22] you are the
[33:23] you are the you're the direct descendant
[33:26] of abraham
[33:28] coming down and that's your people
[33:30] that's out there
[33:32] until one day it finally rose up in him
[33:34] enough until he started
[33:36] defending his people and killed that man
[33:39] you know
[33:42] see because he realized who he was he
[33:44] didn't have to wait you
[33:46] you get it in the ten commandments they
[33:48] do the best they can and i thank god for
[33:49] all of that
[33:50] but you get in there and they had him
[33:52] like 40 50 years old
[33:54] when he finally found out who he was
[33:57] and then they run him out of each read
[33:59] your bible they didn't run him out he
[34:00] ran out of himself
[34:04] because remember he went back out the
[34:05] next day and one of the
[34:07] the israelites or jewish people said he
[34:10] was
[34:10] correcting them you know and they said
[34:12] you're going to kill us like you killed
[34:14] that egyptian well he knew right then he
[34:16] was out of there
[34:18] he prepared to leave
[34:22] because he knew what had happened had
[34:24] been exposed
[34:26] and he couldn't do it so that's what i'm
[34:28] saying you do the best they do the best
[34:30] they can in the movies and the things
[34:31] like that
[34:32] but most of the time they do it to try
[34:34] to attract
[34:36] you know they they claim what is it uh
[34:39] everything has to be in movies now
[34:41] especially nowadays
[34:42] in what you call it sections of of like
[34:46] it's only two or three minutes then it
[34:48] changes
[34:49] because your human mind locks in at on
[34:52] two or three minutes and stops
[34:53] but if you change the scene real quick
[34:55] and make something real
[34:57] drastic happen ever say 10 minutes or
[35:00] ever what time it would be i don't know
[35:02] i just heard this but i realize that's
[35:04] what they're doing they're changing that
[35:05] to make you
[35:06] hold your mind not you're going to go to
[35:07] sleep especially if you're 81 years old
[35:16] but you see they do the best they can
[35:18] thank god for it but we
[35:20] we we'll take what the prophet said
[35:25] and believe in that and then he knew
[35:27] from his youth who he was
[35:31] what did he come for his mama told him
[35:32] daily
[35:35] because she was taking care of him okay
[35:37] let's go on with it
[35:38] all right now
[35:44] we started out explaining that gifts and
[35:46] callings of god are
[35:47] are calling on god are without
[35:49] repentance you don't repent to get a
[35:51] gift you're born with it
[35:53] all right now don't get all involved in
[35:57] it
[35:57] take it as i try to explain it
[36:00] step by step
[36:04] because if not you say well i got the
[36:06] holy ghost before
[36:07] foreign born into the world then because
[36:09] i got the gift
[36:13] that's that's not what he's talking
[36:14] that's not what your prophet is saying
[36:16] when he said he was born with a gift
[36:19] he was born with natural gifts
[36:23] natural abilities to do things right
[36:26] that other people don't have it's gift
[36:29] all right see that don't make it to
[36:32] baptism of the holy ghost
[36:35] i tried to explain that you have gifts
[36:37] you have gifts to be able to understand
[36:39] if you have to if you have the new birth
[36:42] today
[36:42] and have the gift of knowledge you had
[36:44] that gift back there
[36:46] but it was in a different form of
[36:47] knowledge
[36:49] maybe not working of god because when
[36:52] you come into
[36:54] christianity you begin to start using
[36:58] that gift
[36:59] that was in you all the time
[37:02] i don't see where there's any problem to
[37:04] understand that but it gives the
[37:06] foundation to be able to
[37:08] say well wait a minute the prophet
[37:10] didn't say this
[37:12] the bible don't say that
[37:15] and you don't get all flusterated you
[37:17] know things
[37:19] you know you go step by step and study
[37:22] things out and think about it
[37:23] think about what your prophet said we
[37:26] were talking about it last night brought
[37:28] around and said
[37:28] i can conclusively prove that you are
[37:31] born again
[37:32] and baptized into the body you take that
[37:37] one little quote and you can make him
[37:39] miss the entire bible
[37:41] unless you understand what he's saying
[37:45] and he said now the new birth is a
[37:47] difference
[37:49] than the baptism
[37:54] well see settle down and listen to what
[37:57] he's talking about
[37:58] take the illustration he always gave
[38:02] he said everything is made known by what
[38:05] illustration
[38:06] before and after
[38:13] everything will fall into place by
[38:14] before and after
[38:16] then you can see what you're dealing in
[38:18] the middle
[38:20] all right and that's what i'm trying to
[38:22] get you to see that's what i've been
[38:23] dealing with
[38:24] the fact that see you had gifts you had
[38:26] things you knew
[38:27] things in your life you were coming up
[38:31] maybe you didn't think about it in the
[38:33] christian realm you didn't think about
[38:34] it in
[38:35] in those terminologies because you were
[38:37] not supposed to
[38:38] but you you were just born a little
[38:40] different
[38:44] i told you i was a sinner and go out and
[38:47] do things of the world
[38:49] and come home and and sit down and feel
[38:51] dirty and feel
[38:52] uh like repenting and and whatever
[38:58] see a lot of people say well i think
[39:00] people tell me well but when i come back
[39:01] i wouldn't i was happy
[39:03] well you see you're not getting it right
[39:05] around said some people are just born
[39:07] different
[39:10] there's just something different about
[39:12] you
[39:15] then you look and you finalize it and
[39:16] you bring it all the way over into your
[39:18] new birth
[39:19] and you bring it up in through the
[39:20] statue of a perfect man and you find out
[39:23] that that was a wonderful thing
[39:25] that you know that you could that god
[39:27] could do those things through you
[39:29] and you're a sinner
[39:33] he don't beat us to death for being i
[39:35] mean for for sinning he beats us to
[39:37] death for being
[39:38] stay in a sinner
[39:42] because we need to get rid of it all
[39:44] right
[39:45] well see that's what i've tried to bring
[39:47] up brought that and then we moved up
[39:49] from there to where
[39:50] that you can really see the the gifts
[39:51] and calling the
[39:53] and you bring it into the new birth and
[39:56] you see that god through the new birth
[39:58] he can
[39:58] activate your life and and things of
[40:01] where you had just the little things in
[40:02] your life that you might see something
[40:04] and you might be a little different in
[40:06] school
[40:06] and we were talking to a sister about it
[40:08] that you can you know you could be
[40:10] and people could run to you for for
[40:12] advice and do different things
[40:14] well see that you take that in the
[40:15] natural
[40:18] but then when you get born again god can
[40:20] activate that
[40:24] he doesn't have to give you another gift
[40:27] the gift is eternal life because that's
[40:29] what the bible says the gift of god is
[40:31] eternal life through jesus christ
[40:33] all right you don't have to give you
[40:35] another gift
[40:37] you're born with a gift see whatever you
[40:41] have today
[40:42] in the line of christian boo doing
[40:45] singing worshiping playing music doing
[40:47] or preaching or whatever see that gift
[40:50] was there
[40:52] but it was just in a form to be not
[40:54] being used maybe you
[40:56] would call the terms of it but then when
[40:58] the holy ghost comes in he starts to do
[41:00] it
[41:00] and then you got the the nine spiritual
[41:03] gifts
[41:04] and look what you've got in the nine
[41:06] spiritual guests you've got love joy
[41:07] peace goodness meekness
[41:08] all of that over one part then you turn
[41:10] over on the other one and you've got
[41:12] the uh the ability to discern
[41:16] the uh speaking in tongues and all kind
[41:18] of things in the nine spiritual gifts
[41:22] that you can have and god could come
[41:26] down during that and the prophet was so
[41:28] wonderful to explain
[41:29] and he said he could use you in that
[41:31] line he could use you one time
[41:34] he even said a a preacher could be could
[41:37] be trained for whatever
[41:38] 30 years or something one thirty minute
[41:40] sermon or something some some
[41:42] normal just a small thing
[41:46] because it's it's what he's got he gave
[41:49] you the gift
[41:52] now wait a minute you're getting it too
[41:53] far okay now hold the point
[41:56] what are we all dealt in predestination
[41:59] so don't run off the deep end think
[42:01] brother dale's dumped us now
[42:02] and he's trying to bring something else
[42:04] down stay with me
[42:08] gifts and callings of god are without
[42:10] repentance
[42:12] you don't repent to get a gift you're
[42:16] born with a gift well
[42:17] i was born with eternal life now wait a
[42:20] minute you gone too far now
[42:22] you stepped out of the bounds of the
[42:23] bible
[42:27] well you said i was born with the gift
[42:29] that was not a gift of the new birth
[42:33] you wasn't born with a gift of the new
[42:34] birth
[42:36] you got to be born again all right see
[42:40] that way you put it in line
[42:41] so when you come into the new birth then
[42:43] you see how that god starts doing
[42:45] like uh let's see uh one of them i've
[42:48] got in here where
[42:49] brother brown said there moses was of
[42:51] all of the things
[42:52] but said one five minutes at the front
[42:55] of that
[42:56] burning bush was worth more than all of
[42:59] his teachings and knowledge
[43:04] he said because dire is where he was
[43:06] anointed
[43:10] we see you got the new birth
[43:14] you may have had a gift of discernment
[43:17] you may have had a gift of being able to
[43:19] understand this that or the other
[43:22] but then that needs to be anointed
[43:26] so it was anointed and put into action
[43:29] then you see it really working
[43:33] in higher realms all right because
[43:36] that's the nine spiritual gifts
[43:38] but in the nine spiritual gifts even the
[43:41] the prophet will cover and i've got them
[43:42] right here if you want me to read that
[43:44] part to you to make sure
[43:45] that in the nine spiritual gifts they
[43:47] are for the perfecting of the signs
[43:50] no no i brother dale i i finally got
[43:52] what you're saying the bible says it's a
[43:54] fifo ministry for the perfection of the
[43:56] sign
[43:56] now you're trying to tell me something
[43:58] else well hang on might tell you a lot
[44:00] more down the road
[44:06] but see when you come into getting the
[44:08] new birth
[44:10] it activates the gift
[44:14] that you already had paul's saying
[44:17] what was the unistro where there after
[44:21] well lois said you know paul said when
[44:24] you're the gift that was in you from
[44:26] your grandmother or something lois
[44:30] well you don't lay on hands he didn't go
[44:33] over there and say
[44:34] now wait a minute lois we got we know
[44:36] you've been this all your lifestyle
[44:38] we're going to take off you can put over
[44:39] over here
[44:40] no no no no it's not none of it is that
[44:43] away
[44:44] see it was to lay on hands to activate
[44:48] that's right yeah why do you lay hands
[44:51] on ministers to send them out
[44:55] to first show others that you're behind
[44:57] them
[44:58] in the ministry of what they're doing
[45:01] but others
[45:01] is to show that that you are you are
[45:05] uh uplifting that gift
[45:08] and honoring that gift that god has
[45:10] given you
[45:11] all right but seeing if i in the nine
[45:14] spiritual gifts
[45:15] god can use you and then not use you
[45:16] again
[45:18] okay that's what your prophet said and
[45:21] see then
[45:23] you can see that there's things that can
[45:25] happen in your life
[45:26] that you realize you were different all
[45:29] right
[45:30] let's see that new birth when it comes
[45:32] into you it
[45:33] activates that gift for god
[45:36] it converts it over from where you was
[45:38] using it for the devil
[45:40] and makes it over into
[45:44] working for god amen all right
[45:47] and see those nine spiritual gifts works
[45:49] in the
[45:51] the body of believers wisdom
[45:55] knowledge templars patience all the
[45:58] statue of perfect man
[45:59] all of those different things that you
[46:01] start reading
[46:03] they're in the local assembly
[46:07] and everybody's there subject you
[46:09] realize what we're talking about life's
[46:10] not on the point of it you ever thought
[46:11] about
[46:12] then you ta what are you going to do
[46:13] with nine spiritual gifts what are you
[46:15] going to do
[46:15] well a woman ain't allowed to do this
[46:17] out of the other now
[46:19] you done walked off the word sorry
[46:22] you done went out on your own limb
[46:26] because
[46:28] woman is allowed to speak in tongues
[46:31] interpret she can have prophecies
[46:34] she can have those signs see in the nine
[46:37] spiritual gifts it don't
[46:38] define between male and female and the
[46:41] operation of gifts
[46:43] it deals with gifts
[46:47] because the sister can can tell you
[46:49] something if you listen to her
[46:51] i like brother woodbury's way of saying
[46:53] it years ago he said that old
[46:55] woman up here in tennessee scrubbing on
[46:57] washboard
[46:58] said she'll tell you something if you'll
[47:00] listen to her say this she's got the new
[47:02] birth
[47:05] she can tell you something this thing
[47:08] ain't just thrown off for the man you
[47:10] know
[47:10] he does all of the things no that's what
[47:12] i'm trying to get you to see
[47:14] in the nine spiritual gifts you show it
[47:16] to me in the nine spiritual gifts
[47:18] that's in the local assembly and god can
[47:21] use those things
[47:22] men are women now you move up to the 5-4
[47:26] ministry
[47:29] out she goes
[47:34] she can't fit in there why
[47:37] because it's a different part deeper
[47:39] part of what's taking place
[47:41] more is happening more is required
[47:44] all right see then in the 5-fold
[47:46] ministry
[47:51] it was so amazing when i began to run
[47:54] little thoughts just to think about what
[47:55] was the prophet talking about
[47:58] and to come back to see how many times
[48:01] he used words like
[48:06] five ministering gifts
[48:11] then he'd talk about those gifts
[48:16] and he talked about an office
[48:22] you're going to have to think a little
[48:23] bit now because you're going to get
[48:24] yourself involved with a
[48:26] with a building with a door in front and
[48:28] i'll call that an office
[48:30] and that's what webster says
[48:33] right but what would be an office in the
[48:36] spiritual realm
[48:39] paul didn't say come on timothy walk in
[48:41] here in my office
[48:43] no before timothy stood the office
[48:51] paul's standing there he was the office
[48:53] of god
[48:55] who used the word office in a different
[48:57] form of your mind instead of thinking
[48:59] about office being a building
[49:00] with doors and windows get it into what
[49:04] it's saying there
[49:05] because it's nine
[49:08] spiritual gifts but five
[49:11] offices
[49:15] huh do you understand
[49:18] you got this at work so much you got
[49:20] this it works so much
[49:21] you got this at work so much and you got
[49:24] this over here
[49:25] that everybody's trying to take brother
[49:26] branham's office
[49:30] stay out of that office i don't care how
[49:33] many doors you got
[49:35] or what you're doing stay out of that
[49:37] office because you'll get yourself in
[49:39] trouble with god in a hurry
[49:41] of trying to do it that way
[49:45] you're following me on what i'm trying
[49:46] to get you to see
[49:49] i'm trying to keep it so simple until to
[49:52] me it's it's
[49:53] it's uh boring to have to keep repeating
[49:56] to people
[49:57] but i learned a long time ago that
[49:59] that's most of the time as i say it a
[50:01] while ago about it that's most of the
[50:02] time when people are really getting it
[50:04] when it seems to be so boring then until
[50:06] it's just amazing
[50:07] and everybody has gone to sleep or gone
[50:09] to water you know it just
[50:11] seemed to be the whole thing now there
[50:12] is some points where you can get so far
[50:14] and sleep but you don't remember nothing
[50:16] but
[50:16] we won't go that way i don't i haven't
[50:19] uh
[50:19] heard anybody snoring in the services
[50:22] maybe you have but
[50:23] you know you'd be like oh brother
[50:26] maloney i used to get
[50:27] tickled at brother maloney well brother
[50:29] schrader was he's bad to go to sleep
[50:31] and he he snore just a little and
[50:34] [Music]
[50:35] my brother maloney by the time he he'd
[50:38] get a couple like that will run them
[50:40] along every door
[50:41] an old brother straighter yeah
[50:45] and put his arm around brother maloney
[50:47] and just hug him up you know
[50:50] and there he'd woke him up well
[50:54] okay yeah seem to get you to life and
[50:57] then
[50:59] when you get people to life and they're
[51:00] at least paying a little attention so
[51:02] i'm going to add my point i fully back
[51:06] what wade said the other day about his
[51:07] bathroom deals now
[51:11] and to prove it worked and nobody went
[51:14] in the bathroom last
[51:16] service i'm just telling you knife
[51:19] church
[51:20] see i'll try to get your life to where
[51:21] you can open up and then you won't sir
[51:23] up on me
[51:24] and kill the rest of the service just
[51:27] remember the prophet
[51:28] said you will give an account
[51:31] for everything you've done and said if
[51:33] you hinder one person
[51:35] with your doing then you'll be
[51:38] responsible
[51:39] that's right well no no no no brother
[51:42] dale you mean we can't go to now nobody
[51:44] didn't say you couldn't go to the
[51:45] bathroom
[51:49] that's where you holler and scream and
[51:50] talk about no nobody didn't say that
[51:53] it says to be nice and comfortable and
[51:56] do
[51:56] you got to go to the bathroom go
[52:02] the housekeeper don't want to clean up
[52:03] poodles in the church
[52:09] but when you just run it and running and
[52:11] running brother brown said a child
[52:13] running through the church would hinder
[52:16] the next service
[52:18] and he said you'll be held accountable
[52:21] no come on if we're held accountable for
[52:25] what we're doing
[52:27] i don't want to hinder nobody else
[52:32] and i'm 81 so you'll see me going to the
[52:34] bathroom before i come in here
[52:38] because that's one of them things you're
[52:39] going to have to go the older you get
[52:41] the more you're going to go
[52:44] so we're not doing that but i'm just
[52:46] telling you i'm standing behind it now
[52:47] i'm behind the rules and regulations of
[52:50] the church
[52:51] and it set forth and i believe you
[52:53] should we wanted it to
[52:54] anyway why would you want to hinder
[52:56] anybody
[52:59] well my little darling
[53:02] your little darling has got them little
[53:05] little
[53:06] little eyes as we call them the doggy
[53:08] eyes you know the
[53:10] little things where you want to pet the
[53:11] little doggy you know and then he bites
[53:13] the daylights out of you
[53:14] but uh okay all right we've done that i
[53:17] got that done
[53:18] so i can quit but listen
[53:24] see then you go from natural gifts
[53:29] to a place of nine spiritual gifts that
[53:32] puts you in the body and begins to work
[53:35] in a realm with god in his ways and then
[53:38] you've got a five-fold ministry
[53:42] and all of these nine spiritual gifts
[53:44] has got to be judged
[53:47] right but even in the five-fold ministry
[53:52] they've got to we judge but our judgment
[53:54] is what the prophet
[53:56] said it's not a judgment of the
[53:59] congregation to decide whether it's
[54:01] right or wrong
[54:04] i mean if you ever get to the point you
[54:06] think you can straighten the preacher
[54:07] out
[54:08] then be careful you might be right
[54:12] but you might be wrong well who are you
[54:15] arguing with
[54:19] see that's the serious part of it we're
[54:21] we're not playing church you know
[54:24] you know for brother dale you'll run
[54:25] people off ain't never run nobody else
[54:27] preaching the word has never run nobody
[54:29] off i've had a lot of people get them
[54:32] walk out
[54:32] yeah but i used to say it and i finally
[54:35] got where i just quit saying and i said
[54:37] if you're going to leave don't slam the
[54:38] door you're going out
[54:39] at least be quiet get up and walk out
[54:42] and go on
[54:43] go somewhere else and do whatever
[54:45] because we ain't built this church on
[54:46] the basis of trying to make people come
[54:48] to church
[54:49] or threaten you because you don't come
[54:52] because you're just a hindrance to me
[54:54] and i'm a hindrance to you if you're not
[54:55] in it brother brown said find you a
[54:57] church
[55:00] that's got a god-given pastor and stay
[55:02] behind it
[55:09] i'm going to say something but it's
[55:10] going to be another week or two to get
[55:12] to it
[55:13] but you know brother around talked about
[55:14] that pastor morning did anybody
[55:21] now we're talking about the 5-fold
[55:22] ministry i invite you to study some in
[55:25] the next few weeks
[55:29] he talked about this pastor more than
[55:31] anybody he said he's the burden barrier
[55:36] now he didn't discount all the rest of
[55:38] them no no no he put their office and
[55:40] gave it right
[55:41] but he put the pastor in the office he
[55:44] says he's ordained
[55:46] to carry you through now watch so we got
[55:48] to get it right he's ordering to carry
[55:50] through if he's ordained
[55:51] well i don't have no trouble quoting
[55:52] that
[55:55] i don't have no problem with quoting the
[55:56] life part that's the before and the
[55:58] after
[55:59] i got it right it's an honor to be a
[56:03] pastor of a church
[56:04] it's an honor but the other four
[56:07] ministries should honor that ministry
[56:10] as to where they're supposed to be and
[56:11] realize what god is doing
[56:13] he's in charge
[56:17] he doesn't have to give an account
[56:19] except now listen
[56:21] wait a minute and i mean what i'm saying
[56:23] the 5-fold ministry gives an account to
[56:25] the prophet's message
[56:27] of how did he bring that but they don't
[56:29] have to give an account to the
[56:30] congregation as to what they're doing
[56:36] oh
[56:37] [Music]
[56:40] brother dale you'd be better off if i'd
[56:41] beat you i'd be better off
[56:43] you know i'd been better off a long time
[56:44] ago if i just quit and let it go
[56:46] but it's too late now i'm sorry
[56:50] i just you know it's just too late i'm
[56:52] i'm trying my best to save your soul
[56:55] and that's what the profit you want to
[56:58] hear it let's see if i can find it
[57:04] i'll run it off while i go
[57:10] anyhow your pastors are dying to lead
[57:13] you through
[57:15] he watches after your soul now here's
[57:18] what we've said we've got to get it in
[57:20] order
[57:21] if you had one ministry greater than the
[57:23] other you have a trouble in the fifo
[57:26] ministry
[57:27] so what did i say to start with
[57:31] he named it this away he gave some
[57:34] the apostles pro he named it over here
[57:36] maybe in a different form of
[57:38] lineup than it is over here but to me
[57:41] he's saying
[57:42] not one minister is greater than the
[57:44] other
[57:46] but you show me where there's any of the
[57:52] ministry
[57:56] because that teach that that pastor sure
[57:59] teacher could bring a greater depth of
[58:01] word
[58:03] but he'll bust the church wide open
[58:06] the evangelist oh he's good
[58:09] but he'll run the people off
[58:13] and the poor old pastor has to sit there
[58:15] and put it back together
[58:19] right so now who's in charge
[58:24] who's got the greatest of all the gifts
[58:28] okay because he's ordained to carry you
[58:31] through
[58:33] but you know what sorry to say it
[58:37] pastors don't believe this statement
[58:40] but they have got to have a pastor
[58:44] i've discussed this with the fivefold
[58:46] ministry people you know what a lot of
[58:47] people have said i've discussed it in
[58:49] ministers meetings
[58:50] they said i'm a pastor i'm a just
[58:53] who do i pay tithes to i can't pay it to
[58:57] myself
[58:58] oh they're really smart
[59:05] you thought about that you ever thought
[59:06] on those lines
[59:08] who does a pastor play tithe to
[59:13] you know back in the old testament the
[59:15] only one that was allowed to receive the
[59:16] tithe was the
[59:18] high priest
[59:21] then he divided it down to the rest
[59:26] come on get in the bible and talk with
[59:28] me about it
[59:30] the high priest was in charge of all of
[59:32] that
[59:33] because he was the pastor and then he
[59:35] driven it down
[59:38] there's a lot can be said we'll try to
[59:40] get it try to keep you from being
[59:43] lost in what's being said to where you
[59:44] could understand
[59:48] that doesn't make the pastor greater no
[59:50] that's why paul said
[59:51] he said i'm the least he said i'm the
[59:55] chiefest of all sinners
[59:59] what about a man so great like that
[1:00:01] until his word was just the power of god
[1:00:04] was behind his word
[1:00:06] but yet to him he didn't think of that
[1:00:14] what do you think about look at brother
[1:00:16] branham no wonder he could be a pastor
[1:00:20] i had a sinner tell me something one
[1:00:21] time and i thought it was a pretty good
[1:00:23] point
[1:00:24] he said don't get between a man and his
[1:00:26] wife
[1:00:27] when you're discussing things said set
[1:00:29] off to the side because you're in
[1:00:31] trouble
[1:00:32] because they're going to get together
[1:00:34] and you're going to be the dirty dog
[1:00:38] now you tell me that's wrong you want to
[1:00:40] go to some of these places and let them
[1:00:42] tell you about it
[1:00:43] don't get between a man and his wife you
[1:00:45] you're going to get in trouble
[1:00:46] because you're going to say to her well
[1:00:47] i think you're and i you know i'm
[1:00:49] thinking and about that time
[1:00:50] they're going to both quit talking to
[1:00:51] each other and they're going to go
[1:00:52] they're bringing
[1:00:53] and they're going to get you they're
[1:00:55] going to be after you
[1:01:01] this old fudge went through some holes
[1:01:02] in the wall
[1:01:04] to find out a lot
[1:01:07] let people tell you all about it and
[1:01:09] then let them decide
[1:01:10] have you ever noticed a word that they
[1:01:12] said about brother branham
[1:01:14] that he was the only man that was ever
[1:01:15] seen that he made you up
[1:01:18] he lifted you up
[1:01:22] that was an honor that he would lift you
[1:01:24] up
[1:01:26] and him being one brother said he said
[1:01:29] me and bill said we decided this right
[1:01:31] here wasn't right in the bible
[1:01:33] i said forgive me
[1:01:38] i'm stumbling around because when he
[1:01:41] said me and bill decided
[1:01:45] i learned real quick bill was sitting
[1:01:47] there letting him just run his mouth
[1:01:49] and after a while he said brother you go
[1:01:51] do it this way
[1:01:53] if the brother had any sense at all he'd
[1:01:54] go do it the way he said it
[1:01:56] i'm getting into ministries and things
[1:01:58] like that but listen
[1:02:01] when you come into the fifo ministry
[1:02:05] you come into offices gifts
[1:02:08] or offices it's not a pastor can pass
[1:02:13] out of
[1:02:13] speaking in tongues or shouting or
[1:02:15] crying or any kind of a gift to you
[1:02:18] that's laying on the hands brother and
[1:02:20] said i don't agree with that
[1:02:23] he said that's where i differ with those
[1:02:25] brothers that you can't lay on hands to
[1:02:27] pass out gifts
[1:02:29] but says you can lay on hands to
[1:02:31] activate the gift
[1:02:33] that is in the person and thing right
[1:02:37] but when you say i'll give you a gift
[1:02:40] we need to go up there because brother
[1:02:41] dale i heard he can give out gifts
[1:02:43] well boy that'd be pretty good
[1:02:48] i can't give you nothing but the word of
[1:02:49] god
[1:02:51] then you're going to make up your mind
[1:02:53] what to do about the rest of it
[1:02:56] because a a minister is a
[1:02:59] an officer as i said
[1:03:03] surely we're past the point of thinking
[1:03:05] about an office as being a
[1:03:07] a building with walls when you're
[1:03:10] talking in spiritual offices it's
[1:03:12] it's a situation or a positional point
[1:03:17] that is valued in line or are looking at
[1:03:20] it as to be the thing that it should be
[1:03:22] in in the line of christianity it has
[1:03:25] nothing to do with an office building or
[1:03:27] anything like that
[1:03:29] uh you go over to banks county and you
[1:03:31] go to the sheriff's office
[1:03:36] well sure yeah we know what the
[1:03:37] sheriff's office right you go over and
[1:03:39] say where's the sheriff's office
[1:03:41] it's right back there three doors down
[1:03:43] well sure that's right that's right
[1:03:44] that's his office but then you turn back
[1:03:47] around and say where's the sheriff
[1:03:49] he's fulfilling his office today because
[1:03:51] he's down at the courthouse in atlanta
[1:03:53] bringing the case against so-and-so
[1:03:56] that's his office
[1:03:58] he's the one ordained to do that
[1:04:03] now you can see why brother brown says
[1:04:04] it's your pastor he's ordained to carry
[1:04:06] you through
[1:04:07] if he's ordained and hey i don't mind
[1:04:08] quoting i love to quote
[1:04:10] he said if your pastor won't stay with
[1:04:11] the truth finds you one that will
[1:04:13] i have no trouble saying that
[1:04:18] you don't agree with me the way that i
[1:04:19] preach and what i do find you another
[1:04:21] church
[1:04:24] but i will quote some more brother brown
[1:04:26] said you have no right to leave a church
[1:04:29] unless there is a doctrinal
[1:04:32] issue now i couldn't i can find that for
[1:04:36] you but
[1:04:37] you want to know it unless you got
[1:04:39] something and that pastor's off the word
[1:04:43] well i don't like him
[1:04:46] well glory that's good i mean god's
[1:04:49] going to change the whole world
[1:04:50] to fit you i don't like you
[1:04:58] okay but let's listen to what he's
[1:05:01] saying about these things
[1:05:03] go ahead and we'll start with number one
[1:05:05] i will read some of these today every
[1:05:08] service i said
[1:05:09] we've had these same notes for four this
[1:05:11] is third third message
[1:05:13] and we've had these same notes i just go
[1:05:15] back and say you know this is the same
[1:05:16] notes
[1:05:19] but look what brother brown said on
[1:05:21] jesus christ this time yesterday and
[1:05:22] forever
[1:05:24] now before you could do it see now god
[1:05:27] does that
[1:05:28] then he sends people into the church
[1:05:30] such as
[1:05:31] preachers teachers evangelists gifts of
[1:05:34] healing
[1:05:35] don't mean the man now can heal you
[1:05:38] it means that he has faith in what he's
[1:05:41] talking about and all that proves the
[1:05:43] bible and that
[1:05:44] all right after that there's prophets
[1:05:49] that seers all those gifts and without
[1:05:53] uh repentance that god sent
[1:05:57] to that the office that's what he said
[1:06:01] office gifts god sent to that office
[1:06:04] gifts
[1:06:05] are sent by god they're for ordained of
[1:06:08] god
[1:06:09] office gifts
[1:06:15] now see your gift if you have a gift it
[1:06:17] was foreordained before the world ever
[1:06:19] begun
[1:06:20] god knowing what you would receive
[1:06:24] but now come on i don't mind i can quote
[1:06:27] it's not the person that comes
[1:06:28] predestinated eternally from god
[1:06:32] but it's the word of seed
[1:06:35] but to remember everything comes before
[1:06:37] knowledge
[1:06:41] predestination of everything comes
[1:06:43] before
[1:06:45] now watch it now office
[1:06:49] gifts are sent of god for ordained of
[1:06:52] god
[1:06:53] and they're set in the church they're
[1:06:55] born in you
[1:06:56] them traits are born in you when you
[1:06:58] come to this world
[1:07:00] you just find your position now i spent
[1:07:02] all that time
[1:07:03] describing how god activates a gift and
[1:07:05] activates it that's exactly what he's
[1:07:07] saying you just find your position
[1:07:11] find out what god wants to use you for
[1:07:17] and he'll take care of it he'll he'll do
[1:07:19] it okay
[1:07:21] go on with christ and all those things
[1:07:24] are in the kingdom of god
[1:07:26] and all of it's for the perfecting of
[1:07:28] the church
[1:07:29] and to bring it together so all of the
[1:07:31] whole thing is for the perfecting
[1:07:34] okay go ahead to the next one number two
[1:07:36] this is from the message service we
[1:07:38] would see jesus
[1:07:44] so when jesus came on the scene the
[1:07:46] bible said he was to be a prophet
[1:07:49] moses said the lord your god shall raise
[1:07:51] up a prophet like and unto me
[1:07:53] and israel always believe their prophets
[1:07:56] because that was god identifying himself
[1:08:00] in human flesh you just think what a
[1:08:02] prophet was
[1:08:05] always any bible scholar knows that
[1:08:07] that's the way
[1:08:08] he identified himself was in his
[1:08:12] you know excuse me we flicked off
[1:08:16] and we'll just read from there because
[1:08:18] we're going to back it up we all know
[1:08:20] that there's local gifts
[1:08:23] now watch him look how brother random
[1:08:25] defines things
[1:08:26] local gifts in the church
[1:08:30] but there is offices of the church
[1:08:35] see women can serve in local doings of
[1:08:39] the church
[1:08:41] but not in the pastor not in the
[1:08:44] preaching
[1:08:47] right because that's in your nine
[1:08:50] spiritual gifts
[1:08:52] god can use you sisters
[1:08:56] but just keep it to where you're going
[1:08:57] and say don't say well i know i'm
[1:08:59] preacher cause boy i tell you what i
[1:09:00] said that and it happened
[1:09:02] no see once but there's offices now
[1:09:04] there's local gifts
[1:09:06] of nine gifts in the church local gifts
[1:09:09] but there is offices of the church and
[1:09:12] that god that's predestinated or for
[1:09:14] ordained
[1:09:15] god has said in the church apostles and
[1:09:17] prophets and teachers pastors and
[1:09:19] evangelists
[1:09:20] and so forth that's god's gifts set
[1:09:23] into the church then there's nine
[1:09:26] spiritual gifts
[1:09:27] that operate in the local body
[1:09:30] and of the believers and they must be
[1:09:33] checked by two
[1:09:34] or three judges now they gotta do it but
[1:09:36] not not this minister up here watching
[1:09:39] before they're to be given to the church
[1:09:42] because
[1:09:43] you know sometimes they could be wrong
[1:09:46] but notice these prophets
[1:09:49] as they were born like i believe in
[1:09:51] jeremiah here
[1:09:52] god said what before you was ever
[1:09:55] conceived in your mother's
[1:09:56] wound i ordained you a prophet over the
[1:10:00] nations but brother dale that just gets
[1:10:03] so much into me because
[1:10:05] i can't see the difference between the
[1:10:07] man and his office
[1:10:10] that's what brother brown says you
[1:10:11] you're doing wrong
[1:10:13] he said to try to define the difference
[1:10:14] between the seventh angel
[1:10:20] you've got to get it straight
[1:10:23] but if random stood before no one that
[1:10:25] was the whole message the other day
[1:10:27] to prove he stood before no one he stood
[1:10:29] before god
[1:10:31] right i don't stand before the
[1:10:35] congregation
[1:10:36] but i stand in the point that the bases
[1:10:39] that i've got to line up what i'm
[1:10:41] talking about
[1:10:42] with that prophet and if i don't then
[1:10:45] i am guilty of schism
[1:10:50] well don't you think brother brown was a
[1:10:52] little off right here that we need to
[1:10:53] straighten that out
[1:10:55] you've never heard that out of this man
[1:10:58] you've always heard one thing before an
[1:11:00] icer will take care of it
[1:11:02] just get into the message and study it
[1:11:05] okay listen because watch now we're just
[1:11:08] conceived in another ordinary
[1:11:09] a prophet over the nations you see moses
[1:11:12] was born a prophet
[1:11:13] and john the baptist 712 years before he
[1:11:16] was born
[1:11:17] he was the voice of one crying in the
[1:11:19] wilderness isaiah the prophet speaking
[1:11:21] of him see
[1:11:22] it's not these gifts are born gifts
[1:11:26] god placing them in the church
[1:11:30] offices fifo ministry
[1:11:33] gifts from god offices
[1:11:36] that god sends brother branham was above
[1:11:40] offices that was sent wade read that now
[1:11:44] the church age book the word
[1:11:45] you take the church ages and you bring
[1:11:46] them all down
[1:11:48] and each one of those church age
[1:11:50] messengers was
[1:11:51] god to the people all right
[1:11:56] let's see where you're going to fit
[1:11:57] brother branham because he said he was
[1:11:59] not
[1:12:00] the messenger to lady osea
[1:12:04] the holy ghost came himself 464 the old
[1:12:07] syllable
[1:12:08] the holy ghost came himself
[1:12:12] on the day of azusa street and then you
[1:12:14] got the ministers of this message got
[1:12:16] the
[1:12:16] audacity to say that azusa street was
[1:12:20] false
[1:12:22] or was not right of god
[1:12:27] you look at me i can call names don't do
[1:12:29] it with me
[1:12:31] just take the bases to realize we
[1:12:33] there's one thing about it is brother
[1:12:34] dale said it he'll
[1:12:35] he'll stand behind it as a man stood in
[1:12:39] this pulpit right here
[1:12:40] that i had already corrected him in the
[1:12:43] meeting we was having
[1:12:45] and he said azusa street was false and
[1:12:48] he said it where we were eating at
[1:12:50] and i confronted him in and said brother
[1:12:52] branham said
[1:12:55] well he come right here and he said zeus
[1:12:57] street was false
[1:13:00] of course everybody in the congregation
[1:13:01] 90 of the people believed him
[1:13:07] because he couldn't preach aero
[1:13:15] come on church what are we getting into
[1:13:20] let me go ahead go to number
[1:13:23] because i want to try to get these go to
[1:13:26] the next number three
[1:13:28] now if you believers how many believers
[1:13:31] is here i could
[1:13:32] not do it i cannot bring him it takes
[1:13:34] all of us together to do it
[1:13:36] i'm just a part of him and you're a part
[1:13:38] of him but if you're sick and needy
[1:13:40] i'm your brother and god sends in the
[1:13:43] church now there's
[1:13:44] nine spiritual gifts goes in each local
[1:13:47] body
[1:13:49] which is tongues interpretation and
[1:13:51] things okay
[1:13:53] even the prophecies and so forth but
[1:13:56] there
[1:13:56] is the five predestinated
[1:14:00] offices of the church
[1:14:04] what is an office like i said you
[1:14:07] realize that
[1:14:07] to use the sheriff you realize that
[1:14:09] we're they've kind of
[1:14:10] done it but you realize in my day when i
[1:14:13] was a just a kid
[1:14:14] you know the sheriff had so much
[1:14:16] authority to but it was something
[1:14:19] he was full authority man everything
[1:14:23] went his way or it didn't go
[1:14:25] he'd go shoot you and they just didn't
[1:14:27] do nothing with him
[1:14:29] because he was the sheriff but what was
[1:14:31] it his office
[1:14:34] what is that that brought around said
[1:14:36] it's not the the
[1:14:37] man with a whistle stand out on the
[1:14:39] thing that blows it he said it's that
[1:14:41] badge
[1:14:42] it's his office and says you better stop
[1:14:46] because that's his office the whole
[1:14:49] world is backing up that sheriff
[1:14:54] as he does his duty because it's an
[1:14:57] office
[1:14:58] with us voted by the people with god
[1:15:01] a position appointed of god
[1:15:05] an office called the
[1:15:09] for ministry all right are you sure
[1:15:13] officers of the church apostles prophet
[1:15:14] teaches pastors and advancements
[1:15:16] that's what god said in the church the
[1:15:17] holy experience that's an office
[1:15:20] okay now it's the holy spirit that's an
[1:15:22] office so what's so fine
[1:15:23] the holy spirit might fall on one
[1:15:24] tonight and speak in tongues
[1:15:26] and the other give the prophecies and so
[1:15:28] forth and then next night it might be
[1:15:31] somebody else
[1:15:32] and somebody else like that that's local
[1:15:35] gifts
[1:15:36] in the body to keep us straight
[1:15:40] okay but in the church alone
[1:15:44] five offices apostles means missionary
[1:15:46] apostles
[1:15:47] prophets teachers pastors and
[1:15:49] evangelists god sets those in the church
[1:15:53] and let's believe with all of our heart
[1:15:56] that through these
[1:15:57] ministering gifts
[1:16:01] that the great god of heaven will send
[1:16:04] christ among
[1:16:05] us tonight amen that we'll see jesus
[1:16:12] is that not your prayer nine
[1:16:15] spiritual gifts right that's good
[1:16:19] but five offices
[1:16:22] and it was so amazing to me that i've
[1:16:24] got about six or eight i know that i
[1:16:26] brought in here
[1:16:27] and i underlined them to where if you
[1:16:29] got your notes with me you can find it
[1:16:34] of offices
[1:16:38] sit in the church
[1:16:42] you know what a pastor to a church is
[1:16:45] he's god to the people
[1:16:50] no no no no bro he's god to the people
[1:16:52] as long as his message
[1:16:54] comes from the prophet but he loses his
[1:16:58] own office
[1:16:59] when he goes after his own idea now you
[1:17:02] see
[1:17:02] why i holler and scream so much and cry
[1:17:04] so much about these ministers today
[1:17:07] and the way they take the message and
[1:17:09] what they do with it
[1:17:13] well brother that brother's got a ride
[1:17:14] he's a human
[1:17:16] there ain't no rod in the gospel
[1:17:22] the word is either true or not true
[1:17:30] but you get the difference see natural
[1:17:32] gifts you you've got in there but then
[1:17:34] you come into this five
[1:17:35] of the nine spiritual gifts and you you
[1:17:38] run that and there's a lot that goes
[1:17:39] with that that can be in the body to the
[1:17:41] brother random even said
[1:17:42] to help keep the church straight is your
[1:17:44] nine spiritual gifts
[1:17:45] somebody speak in tongues and say just
[1:17:47] need to get this straightened up so and
[1:17:49] so
[1:17:49] it's been out here committing adultery
[1:17:52] there's no problem with that
[1:17:55] you know what i mean well no that ain't
[1:17:58] why not you're just in the nine
[1:18:01] spiritual gifts
[1:18:03] with the nine spiritual gifts of god
[1:18:06] now you move on up into the five whole
[1:18:10] ministry
[1:18:13] and you see that five-fold ministry
[1:18:15] answers to no one
[1:18:21] but has to have as their foundation what
[1:18:25] the apostles and prophets
[1:18:30] built upon the foundation of the
[1:18:32] apostles and prophets jesus christ
[1:18:35] the chief cornerstone
[1:18:40] there's a lot of difference in local
[1:18:41] gifts
[1:18:43] they have to be judged
[1:18:47] but the fifo ministry don't have to be
[1:18:49] judged he's judged himself
[1:18:52] i'm judged every day by whether or not i
[1:18:54] stay with the message
[1:18:55] you don't have to judge me i'll judge my
[1:18:57] own self
[1:18:59] yeah but you try to hide it from us so
[1:19:01] we get okay i got it
[1:19:07] where was it at i wrote one down where
[1:19:10] brother random said
[1:19:12] don't put your pastor too high
[1:19:17] give him the opportunity to be a human
[1:19:21] don't put him so high that he can't
[1:19:23] attain to what you got him
[1:19:31] it's odd isn't it you mean brother dale
[1:19:34] i can't have my own idea
[1:19:39] where are you going to fit it it won't
[1:19:41] fit in the nine spiritual gifts
[1:19:43] because one of those is wisdom and
[1:19:46] another one is knowledge
[1:19:48] and wisdom and knowledge goes in the
[1:19:50] statute of a perfect man to prove the
[1:19:51] individual to be correct
[1:19:53] so our ideas cannot fit in that
[1:19:57] well who am i going who am i going to
[1:19:59] believe
[1:20:00] i've said it and i don't back off i
[1:20:03] wouldn't
[1:20:04] follow the biggest portion of the
[1:20:05] pastors of this message or the preachers
[1:20:07] of this message
[1:20:09] i would not follow them i would not go
[1:20:10] to church with them
[1:20:14] i would hunt for me something else if i
[1:20:15] had to drive across the country
[1:20:20] well brother you're trying to run me off
[1:20:22] if i can run you off
[1:20:25] that's great because i'm getting rid of
[1:20:27] a problem
[1:20:29] and you're getting rid of one because
[1:20:31] you're going somewhere else
[1:20:34] this church ain't never been built on
[1:20:36] brother dale as a
[1:20:43] it's always built on one thing
[1:20:46] the word of god let me take that prophet
[1:20:49] like what i said when i started looking
[1:20:51] at this gibson collins
[1:20:53] immediately it started appearing office
[1:20:55] office office office office office
[1:20:58] i never thought of the fifo ministry
[1:20:59] being in office
[1:21:01] had you
[1:21:04] you ever thought i mean literally had
[1:21:06] you ever thought about the fivefold
[1:21:07] ministry
[1:21:08] as an office
[1:21:12] god given office
[1:21:16] responsible to god himself
[1:21:22] don't go to a 5-4 ministry prophecy i
[1:21:24] think you're wrong
[1:21:28] let's print off where he is
[1:21:34] so i ain't going to talk to you about
[1:21:35] what i think here's what he said
[1:21:40] that's no problem to me
[1:21:43] because i know one thing for sure you're
[1:21:45] right and i'm wrong or i'm right and
[1:21:46] you're wrong or both of us are wrong
[1:21:48] because we both can't be right and put
[1:21:50] it in the wrong thing
[1:21:53] do you understand what i'm getting at
[1:21:58] the gifts that god gave the church is
[1:22:00] offices
[1:22:03] to run the church
[1:22:10] offices that's why don't don't come to
[1:22:13] me and say
[1:22:14] brother dale would it be something if
[1:22:16] you could run for president
[1:22:17] you are degrading my little bit of
[1:22:20] mentality that i already have or think i
[1:22:22] have
[1:22:24] because i'm in the greatest position i'm
[1:22:27] in the greatest office
[1:22:29] because i am in no way trying to be a
[1:22:32] brother branham to be a
[1:22:34] that has already been fulfilled and
[1:22:35] cannot be fulfilled by nobody but that
[1:22:37] point that he done it
[1:22:38] and it wouldn't matter if i'd have been
[1:22:39] there you would have been there you say
[1:22:41] if i'd have been there i'd have said it
[1:22:42] if you'd have been there and you'd been
[1:22:43] like me you'd messed it up
[1:22:46] so the best thing to say if you'd been
[1:22:47] there just forget it sit down and listen
[1:22:49] to the prophet
[1:22:52] brother dale you're just hateful because
[1:22:54] i've seen you when you enjoy
[1:22:55] you know and you'd be happy about what
[1:22:57] you're seeing i'm happy about what i see
[1:22:59] but i'm trying my best to save your soul
[1:23:05] i'm trying to preach what the prophet
[1:23:07] has said to us
[1:23:09] to save your soul
[1:23:13] and then if i miss it i have no problems
[1:23:19] because i reached that position a long
[1:23:21] time ago i believe
[1:23:22] that where brother branham said it he
[1:23:25] said with the attitude i have something
[1:23:27] like
[1:23:27] he said i could look at god and he could
[1:23:30] say you're
[1:23:31] lost and going to hell and he said i'd
[1:23:32] say i love him and walk right on by
[1:23:35] now notice what he said if he went with
[1:23:37] the attitude he had right there
[1:23:40] but the attitude i have in the baptism
[1:23:42] of the holy ghost and what a pastor of a
[1:23:43] church is and what i'm trying to do and
[1:23:45] what i'm trying to get you to do
[1:23:48] i could walk before god and say thank
[1:23:50] you
[1:23:52] i tell him every day thank you lord
[1:23:56] thank you for showing me these things
[1:24:02] now help me get it to the people
[1:24:10] because i'm just trying to be the best i
[1:24:12] can
[1:24:14] an office
[1:24:18] see we look at gifts and things we don't
[1:24:19] think about it being an office
[1:24:22] but that's what it is
[1:24:25] it's an office that a minister stands in
[1:24:28] an office where nobody else can stand
[1:24:32] he gives an account to the the lord
[1:24:34] himself
[1:24:39] well brother dale you don't think i got
[1:24:41] a right to come and tell you wrong
[1:24:42] i'll give you the right to come and tell
[1:24:44] me i'm wrong i don't care whether it's
[1:24:46] right or not
[1:24:47] whether it's right with god or not i'll
[1:24:49] give it to you myself
[1:24:52] because i want to be right and i want
[1:24:55] you to be right
[1:24:58] a five-fold ministry is an office
[1:25:02] set aside of god as a gift to give unto
[1:25:04] the church whatever you do with a gift
[1:25:06] now i'm quoting brother random
[1:25:08] whatever you do with a gift is how you
[1:25:12] dealing with god
[1:25:16] but now if your pastors are dying to
[1:25:17] lead you through
[1:25:21] while you're running around to the
[1:25:22] neighbors try to find some
[1:25:28] oh
[1:25:33] why are you traveling somewhere to try
[1:25:35] to find something or sit and listen to
[1:25:37] that on the internet something
[1:25:40] when you believe your pastor is ordained
[1:25:41] to lead you through
[1:25:43] now now let's keep it straight because
[1:25:46] you know i have never said a word about
[1:25:48] you doing that
[1:25:50] i have never said you was wrong to go to
[1:25:53] other churches
[1:25:56] but i said one thing for sure that i've
[1:25:59] always stood on
[1:26:00] you bring back a doctrine i will come to
[1:26:03] the pulpit
[1:26:06] and denounce that doctrine
[1:26:10] because i am the pastor
[1:26:19] i am ordained to lead you through
[1:26:23] well let's get to the point where we
[1:26:24] need to be well what do you want us to
[1:26:26] do brother today i'll take a special
[1:26:27] offering for you today
[1:26:29] oh that's good how about me giving you
[1:26:31] something that's where you can't argue
[1:26:33] with me
[1:26:36] you can't argue with me about those
[1:26:38] things
[1:26:40] you can't argue and say what do you want
[1:26:41] an offering a special offering right up
[1:26:43] to buy you a new cadillac
[1:26:45] i'll give away more than most of you
[1:26:47] making a year easily
[1:26:53] christmas alone is 14 to 15 or 16
[1:26:56] thousand dollars
[1:27:00] for to give you at christmas
[1:27:06] why because i want to
[1:27:10] not because i have to but i want to
[1:27:15] i want to help you
[1:27:19] because to me that's a pastor
[1:27:22] like i said the man said don't get
[1:27:24] between a man and his wife okay the best
[1:27:25] thing you do is get there and say no
[1:27:27] listen i'm not taking sides with neither
[1:27:28] one of you
[1:27:29] we're going to sit here and work this
[1:27:30] thing out but i'm going to tell you up
[1:27:32] front i ain't taking sides of you
[1:27:34] that's a true minister of any ministry
[1:27:40] because you know how that puppy dog
[1:27:41] little you look over there and she said
[1:27:44] well he treats me dirty he don't never
[1:27:47] tell me he loves me would you ever tell
[1:27:50] him you love him
[1:27:54] no it's his job to say it
[1:28:02] this you want to try saying it
[1:28:06] you want to try saying i love you honey
[1:28:11] yeah like i said sometimes i have to say
[1:28:13] it i know you honey
[1:28:18] oh but your brother's tail
[1:28:22] i'm truthful i ain't gonna lie to you
[1:28:25] about it
[1:28:30] but you see the difference do you
[1:28:31] understand what i'm getting at
[1:28:33] that after all is said i've done of a
[1:28:35] five-fold ministry
[1:28:37] what are you trying to do get something
[1:28:39] of your own
[1:28:40] some doctrinal
[1:28:42] [Music]
[1:28:46] i've had the offer to go to
[1:28:50] other situations
[1:28:54] it would have been a lot of money i've
[1:28:56] had an offer i'd be offering here
[1:28:57] for it all the time to have a lot of
[1:28:59] money
[1:29:00] i've never done it because it don't suit
[1:29:03] me
[1:29:06] they just don't fit
[1:29:11] i'd rather give you than you to give to
[1:29:13] me
[1:29:15] then i'll tell you one thing that you
[1:29:17] owe me
[1:29:20] you want to know what's the one thing
[1:29:21] that that you owe me
[1:29:26] if i'm your pastor you owe me one thing
[1:29:29] to pray for me
[1:29:35] you owe me that because you realize what
[1:29:39] is having to be done and go
[1:29:43] sometimes you have to do things in a
[1:29:44] different ways and all like that and
[1:29:45] sometimes you have to just
[1:29:47] go off somewhere
[1:29:51] but listen god's office gifts
[1:29:58] this is from perseverance number eight
[1:30:02] but he said god's office gift
[1:30:06] the office apostles prophets teachers
[1:30:09] pastors evangelists
[1:30:13] and we must respect them if we expect
[1:30:16] something from god
[1:30:24] does that strike home you want something
[1:30:27] from god how do you get it
[1:30:32] bless god i ain't never like i talked to
[1:30:33] a man one time he said i ain't playing
[1:30:35] tired of no preacher
[1:30:36] well you know what that ended me with
[1:30:39] ever to be able to give him any money
[1:30:43] because if he wasn't going to line up he
[1:30:45] wasn't going to get nothing from me
[1:30:50] but that's what he said he said ain't
[1:30:51] paying tithe to no preacher
[1:30:54] but brother dale you talk about the
[1:30:56] tithes and things well how do you pay
[1:30:57] tithe
[1:30:58] you realize what i do all these
[1:31:00] ministers here which is contrary to most
[1:31:02] pastors in this message any word i've
[1:31:04] ever heard of
[1:31:04] that they don't pay their their local
[1:31:07] ministers
[1:31:09] they just feel it an honor to preach to
[1:31:12] them
[1:31:13] every time anybody preaches here they
[1:31:14] get a paid salary just like i get
[1:31:19] maybe not as much because it would be
[1:31:21] hard to do
[1:31:23] but see i pay tithe
[1:31:27] i pay tithe upon my working parts you
[1:31:30] know what i mean by that i retired from
[1:31:32] general motors i'll get a social
[1:31:33] security check
[1:31:33] i get all that i pay tithe on that
[1:31:36] because that's my income
[1:31:39] but then when it comes to the church and
[1:31:41] what they give me
[1:31:42] i pay tithe on him well how do you keep
[1:31:45] it straight where you can i don't i just
[1:31:47] depend on god
[1:31:49] and some brother comes through and
[1:31:53] you know we have to handle it through
[1:31:55] the secretary and they say well what are
[1:31:56] you doing they know right now
[1:31:58] that the next fellow that come ain't
[1:32:00] going to get the same about the other
[1:32:01] fellow god or he might get more might
[1:32:02] get less
[1:32:04] i just say and that's why they asked me
[1:32:06] what do you say
[1:32:07] i said 800 000.
[1:32:13] see i'm paying tithe
[1:32:17] you know why because that's the money
[1:32:18] the church give me
[1:32:21] see what the money that's in this church
[1:32:24] this building
[1:32:25] and things belongs to the church
[1:32:31] but the money this intake doesn't belong
[1:32:33] to the church
[1:32:35] it's me and i have a right to take every
[1:32:38] dime of it and spend every time of it
[1:32:42] why because it's mine
[1:32:45] but i've also paid tithe on what's been
[1:32:48] given
[1:32:51] and always will i like the way
[1:32:55] brother dick addison said it he said if
[1:32:56] i backslide
[1:32:58] and get to where i ain't even christian
[1:33:00] he said i'm gonna pay my tithe
[1:33:01] is because the bible says there's a
[1:33:03] great honor that goes with that
[1:33:05] you know but you see i pay tithe
[1:33:09] see a church pays tithe
[1:33:13] in the old testament you only had tithes
[1:33:14] for certain things
[1:33:17] you didn't have it forever little doing
[1:33:19] but you had to tithe offering for
[1:33:20] running the church
[1:33:21] you had a tithe offering for the but the
[1:33:24] mind control was the high priest
[1:33:27] he was in full charge
[1:33:31] and whatever he said did put it that's
[1:33:33] where it went
[1:33:39] you see church i'm just trying my best
[1:33:41] to be one thing to you
[1:33:43] a bible pastor
[1:33:49] now if you're going to narrow it down to
[1:33:51] five offices
[1:33:54] i'm going to make a statement that i've
[1:33:56] made to you many times which is the
[1:33:58] truth though
[1:34:00] i don't consider myself to be much of a
[1:34:02] pastor
[1:34:04] you might label me as a teacher or
[1:34:08] something that's up to you
[1:34:11] but you see a man can't hold two offices
[1:34:15] brother branham was the only man that
[1:34:18] could hold two offices
[1:34:25] yeah i'm not to do it so if you come
[1:34:28] down to the point say well okay brother
[1:34:29] dale what are you going to do well i'd
[1:34:30] have to sit down
[1:34:32] we'd have to get us a pastor but we'd
[1:34:35] have to check him out to see whether
[1:34:36] he's an apostle or
[1:34:39] a prophet or a teacher
[1:34:43] before we could vote for him to find out
[1:34:45] whether he'd be the pastor it's not to
[1:34:47] work
[1:34:47] i want brother so-and-so i like his type
[1:34:50] of preaching
[1:34:50] well what is it well i know y'all don't
[1:34:52] like him because he's a teacher but i do
[1:34:55] now you put yourself up there you're
[1:34:57] you're trying to determine what office
[1:34:59] come on musician just remember they're
[1:35:02] in here so i'll be glad
[1:35:03] you can have them you've got them of how
[1:35:06] many times brother branham would call
[1:35:07] the fivefold ministry
[1:35:08] offices offices
[1:35:12] ministerial offices
[1:35:16] gifts or offices that god
[1:35:20] gave the church
[1:35:24] but i can also quote a lot of the other
[1:35:26] that brother branham said in the church
[1:35:28] age series if you won't honor your
[1:35:31] church age messenger he said god will
[1:35:33] take him off the scene
[1:35:38] well don't not said that because you say
[1:35:40] well brother dad we're going to meet
[1:35:41] right out of church and dishonor you
[1:35:43] well go ahead just let me know where i
[1:35:45] can come
[1:35:47] i'll save you the trouble you know i
[1:35:50] just walk out
[1:35:52] because i know for one thing for certain
[1:35:54] i'm not saved
[1:35:56] by preaching i'm not kept saved by
[1:35:59] preaching
[1:36:01] it's the greatest honor could be because
[1:36:03] don't run me for president that's not an
[1:36:05] honor
[1:36:06] i'm the great at this position or the
[1:36:08] greatest honor could ever be
[1:36:09] because there's one thing about it
[1:36:10] there's only one man higher than my
[1:36:12] office
[1:36:13] and he's passed on but he brought us the
[1:36:15] message
[1:36:18] but he would say it here today if he was
[1:36:19] standing here he'd say there's one man
[1:36:21] higher than my office
[1:36:23] and he said that's the lord jesus christ
[1:36:29] the gifts and callings are really
[1:36:32] without any repentance or any
[1:36:33] trying to get them or searching for them
[1:36:39] let's stand together think on these
[1:36:42] things
[1:36:44] pray for wade this afternoon and the
[1:36:46] ministry and the things and we're just
[1:36:47] trying our best to be
[1:36:50] what we can be
[1:36:51] [Music]
[1:36:57] a gift is also
[1:37:00] listed and you start studying about a
[1:37:04] gift and a position in an office and
[1:37:06] thing
[1:37:08] and you'll find that it goes to the
[1:37:09] military stripes on a man's shoulder
[1:37:15] that even though you hate him
[1:37:20] i've heard people say you know that
[1:37:22] we're in the military they say
[1:37:24] i wanted to kill that guy
[1:37:28] i said one day i come in battle i wanted
[1:37:30] to grab him to hug him because i had
[1:37:32] been trained
[1:37:34] i said i wanted to kill him
[1:37:39] but he said i respected that bar that he
[1:37:41] had on his shoulder
[1:37:44] if you respect anything disrespect one
[1:37:47] time pastor
[1:37:48] and pray for it
[1:37:52] that god will use him and pray for the
[1:37:54] other four ministries that's there
[1:37:55] see we have the greatest opportunity
[1:37:59] we have ministers more than just a
[1:38:01] pastor
