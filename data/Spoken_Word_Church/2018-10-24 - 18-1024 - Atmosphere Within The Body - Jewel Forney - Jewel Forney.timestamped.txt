[0:00] the spirit that now worketh in the
[0:01] children of disobedience among whom also
[0:05] we all had our conversation in time past
[0:08] in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the
[0:11] desires of the flesh and of the mind and
[0:13] we're by nature the children of Wrath
[0:15] even at other but God who is rich in
[0:20] mercy for with his great love with his
[0:24] great love wherewith he loved us
[0:28] father God help me one more time -
[0:32] you're my body my mind and my spirit my
[0:35] soul to you God trust Lord that you
[0:38] would help me to get out of the way Lord
[0:39] now father in the name of Jesus Christ I
[0:42] they give you all my scrip for this
[0:43] service in Jesus Christ's holy name we
[0:46] pray amen
[0:47] god bless you you may be seated one
[0:49] moment praise God we thank the Lord for
[0:51] the reading of the word of God this
[0:53] evening
[0:54] I just thank the Lord for I looked at I
[0:56] was hurry but say God formed man out of
[0:58] just utter earth and breathed into man
[1:00] and man became a living soul and I
[1:04] looked at the scripture then I find out
[1:06] here over here we find in in the book of
[1:08] all our you feed and to refine out here
[1:11] that that living soul right now that we
[1:13] see that God breathed into a man we
[1:15] looking at here the Bible say he walked
[1:17] according to the course of the world
[1:19] through the lusts of the flesh
[1:21] fulfilling the desires of the mind and
[1:24] out of flesh my title reels the
[1:28] atmosphere within the body and I took
[1:31] that title because I realized today we
[1:34] feel that we are fighting a battle on
[1:36] the outside but really we fighting from
[1:39] the inside how do we find out here that
[1:41] death when Paul was right in Ephesians
[1:44] he was not writing about something on
[1:46] the outside he did fulfilling that his
[1:48] are that of my the lust of the flesh
[1:51] every datum was in from the inside out
[1:54] so the atmosphere that we in war with it
[1:57] from the inside how do we you know today
[1:59] we come we said
[2:01] do you say well the devil made me do it
[2:03] Holly we're together first so how could
[2:06] the devil make you do it how do we need
[2:08] this damn baby from her he can't control
[2:10] of the mind and that's how you do it so
[2:13] I'm gonna take a like that uh everything
[2:16] within the body go say the rudest thing
[2:18] this earth that you live in this body
[2:21] that you live in
[2:22] I'll do it right now till you're born in
[2:25] the Spirit of God you are in Satan to me
[2:28] saying hell is the god of yours do you
[2:33] you go you say bread you will you get
[2:34] therefore you go back and read or eat

[2:45] body wouldn't put it or why would
[2:47] somebody die it's a dust another stir
[2:50] how do you turn your body back so our
[2:52] body is part of this earth as Satan is

[2:58] quotation not a future home to count a
[3:00] bag of I'm coming from in the future

[7:46] ain't a white lie but we make it look
[7:48] that way it sounds better if we can make

[11:05] choice every day you go it's a war every
[11:08] time you wake up how do you got a better
[11:11] first day you wait I wish to say this on
[11:13] when I wake up in the morning first and
[11:15] I've got a battle Satan all day long in
[11:19] eight until your nitro it's the
[11:21] supernatural you fighting against he
[11:24] says now the 21st verse he said it he's
[11:28] uh I find that in I find that a law that
[11:32] when I would do what he was were you
[11:37] can't get away from it you cannot get
[11:40] away from it
[11:41] my prefer within watch what Paul says
[11:44] for I delight in the law of God I don't
[11:47] know what I'm happy for not something
[11:52] natural but the supernatural I mean I
[11:54] did light in the supernatural goddess in
[11:57] me so beginning to look here we think of
[12:00] your so you say brother why do I have
[12:02] trial why do I have tribulation Holly
[12:05] while walking I just live with life I'll
[12:07] do a perfect piece on the mountain and
[12:10] live in the millennium married a pervy
[12:14] husband called a purpose that we never
[12:22] had one battle but did your one we never
[12:26] had about he must be dead
[12:31] it's a tube in a way well if we think
[12:34] we're gonna find this perfect it Romeo a
[12:36] perfect Juliet to drop out of the sky
[12:38] you got the wrong revelation we all were
[12:41] only thing that perfect is the blood of
[12:43] Jesus Christ Holly but I'm gonna deal
[12:46] with a few things this morning I just
[12:47] even adjust to kind of waiting just to
[12:50] bring it to he who is that perfect God
[12:53] I'd be like in the Spirit of God is
[12:55] within me hey I wrote down here what's
[12:58] up Dana wrote to see you to spirit Jesus
[13:00] say my words they are spirit and life
[13:02] only thing that quicken that body is the
[13:05] divine power or the whole ego that dwell
[13:08] on inside of it but you're still gonna
[13:12] walk is this you still got a war against
[13:15] this with when you win the battle I
[13:18] probably say it's the chief said quit
[13:19] dog win it switch when you feed the most
[13:22] hi Louie don't work cuz you fighting
[13:24] against a spiritual war it's an
[13:26] atmosphere going on now what you know
[13:28] you're I'm gonna deal with this Ralph I
[13:30] want to read a quote from trials for a
[13:31] few minutes because realizing what
[13:33] people don't want your trials I do not
[13:37] get up and start praying for a trial I
[13:40] had one brother of mine he didn't have
[13:43] about it in such a while he started
[13:45] praying for God to send the devil he
[13:48] want a trial I say what you say would
[13:51] you say about that
[13:52] he domina not him he go forever God owns
[13:56] a guy you know when I'm ready
[13:58] how do you know when I'm ready to take
[14:00] this job but in a way he got it how all
[14:02] of a sudden the pain hit him so bad they
[14:04] had to rush him to the hospital and they
[14:06] never did find out what was wrong with
[14:08] him only person he knew with me he
[14:12] didn't want to act for it he got it I'm
[14:15] not a god drive about the god nursing
[14:17] but God will you see me worthy enough to
[14:20] give me the trial Holly I'll be strong
[14:23] enough to face it let me read him a
[14:26] message of God in His Word the proper
[14:29] preacher he says and he is not a is not
[14:32] a grand feeling to know what God Grace
[14:36] has carried carried some of you some of
[14:40] you here
[14:42] through 20 and 30 years of trials 20 or
[14:50] 30 years of trials something you got a
[14:52] lot more neck and something you've got a
[14:54] lot more net how do you know 20 or 30
[14:57] years of trials and number guaranteed
[14:59] ain't nobody in here to say they've been
[15:00] trial free have you ain't nobody in here
[15:03] can say did he find that okay oh man
[15:06] that's all right man like that yeah oh
[15:10] he's into it so yeah that's it right
[15:13] there
[15:14] twenty or thirty years of trials and
[15:16] persecutions you have to trace Church
[15:21] Smith how do we do people reject it
[15:24] I didn't seen all this stuff I've got
[15:26] told I didn't wanna come and since I've
[15:28] been in the message I didn't see people
[15:30] turning issue ain't got nothing to do
[15:32] with you
[15:33] I didn't have my share of the trials and
[15:36] persecuted so God did it for you to show
[15:41] them that you were they what then why
[15:46] you still in church today if you would
[15:49] have been a real child of God you've
[15:50] been out of here Oh how'd it go some
[15:52] trials are coming to snatch you right
[15:54] out of here
[15:54] I lose some temptation to go how what
[15:57] pressure you gonna probably have no
[15:59] counter pressure time that your pressure
[16:00] or this pressure on that brother
[16:02] pressure your job but you find yourself
[16:05] still serving God that is not you got
[16:08] referring you and he's and he has taken
[16:13] you into his fellowship some day into
[16:16] and some day some day in the face of all
[16:20] OH
[16:20] has criticized you you'll be glorified
[16:25] and made a body like unto his glorious
[16:29] body
[16:31] okay it is coming wait we wait for the
[16:35] Blessed hope so now he talked he said
[16:37] now he's speaking either you will be
[16:40] made into his glorious body I'm killed
[16:42] in till we're just until your party
[16:46] chain deal with this
[16:48] you say definitely gonna get good but
[16:52] every man had trials before you ever man
[16:54] go ahead of trials after you
[16:56] so don't let trial throw you out of the
[16:58] mud missing you but look what's going on
[17:00] around here man
[17:01] Holly that's what's going on around the
[17:02] master that might be calling around the
[17:04] message but ain't going on inside of me
[17:06] I believe it I'll give somebody could
[17:10] talk you out of your revelation you
[17:12] never had a revelation
[17:14] Holly revelation okay why Eve I said
[17:16] they say the message though
[17:18] hold it don't matter I know what God
[17:20] done for me
[17:21] I know what God done for me I'm not
[17:27] gonna be involved in those like I want
[17:29] to don't let me preach so I begin to go
[17:32] here I begin to live here I'm gonna
[17:33] think about a few trials for a few
[17:35] minutes you ain't done in one hair
[17:36] trials sisters Bible being wrote in a
[17:40] big number the book of ups and down the
[17:42] trial how do you prove we were a new God
[17:45] no no way I can prove that their son of
[17:47] God but gotta go I gotta let him go
[17:49] through the fire I gotta let you up
[17:52] to prove to the devil I got a people on
[17:55] the face in here I don't care how many
[17:57] demons a fight I don't care how hard the
[17:59] battle get they will not give up man cuz
[18:05] when you been think about all the years
[18:08] you seen people fall away normally they
[18:11] fall away because of something happened
[18:13] they feel like somebody don't lock up in
[18:15] church somebody tell ya you know exist
[18:17] old people fall away for every day how
[18:19] do i how I'm gonna go find me a church
[18:21] with a bit more revelation and all kind
[18:24] of stuff people got any mind but the
[18:26] point of it is you don't need one
[18:30] revelation Jesus Christ in you the hope
[18:32] of glory that feel Lord to fulfill the
[18:35] whole thing but the point is if you're
[18:37] at the ferry right you know where if the
[18:40] wrong Atma thrown inside of you the
[18:42] wrong manifestation go come on the
[18:44] outside so he goes in there it says here
[18:47] I'm gonna deal with some trial before
[18:48] you how do I begin to think about when
[18:51] we think about trying to get ourselves
[18:52] up on my let get away from what we think
[18:55] about ourselves with me and then look at
[18:56] other people that went down before they
[18:58] had tried before
