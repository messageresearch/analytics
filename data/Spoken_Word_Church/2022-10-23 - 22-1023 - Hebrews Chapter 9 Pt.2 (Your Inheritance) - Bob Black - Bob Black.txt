TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign we're so grateful to be able to gather together Lord this morning and pray Lord that you'll just bless us as we study these things out that Paul spoke of Lord and bless our services today brother wade back there studying Lord God prepare our hearts and our minds to receive what you have in store for us today we ask in your name so we almost made it well we uh we we made it through Hebrews 9 but I just wanted to back up and just kind of um you know sometimes there's little scriptures you just kind of want to sit on for a little bit and um so back up to verse 15 and just kind of make our way back through to the beginning of verse 10 or the chapter 10. so Paul was saying in in Hebrews chapter 9 he says for this cause he is the mediator of the New Testament that by means of death for the Redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of Eternal inheritance for where a testament is there must also of necessity be the death of the testator for a testament is a force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth now you think even in the natural when someone dies then you go uh stand before the lawyer or whatever and the wheel is red and you get access to the things that they've left for you to have access to and in the same way when Christ died then you got access to you you got access to your inheritance that that was uh was there for you from before the foundation of the world but just want to kind of meditate on what that means that your inheritance now um you know if you're if you were reading the last will and testament you can see that this is really a great picture because it shows that your will uh you know it could be a house or money or a car or got a key to to something and it's all granted and then when the wheel is red and now you've got access to that now brother Brown said in in adoption number three we read this last time he said I inherited something what inheritance there had to be somebody leave me an inheritance why you say Jesus left you an inheritance beg your pardon Jesus never left me an inheritance Jesus Jesus never left you an inheritance he only came down and paid for your inheritance brought you to your inheritance but your name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world God gave you your inheritance your inheritance was first here's the way they try to make it God said well there's a lot of people lost I don't want them be saved so I'll I'll send down Jesus I'll send that Jesus down and perhaps maybe if somebody'll feel sorry I know what I've done and get saved I wouldn't run my office like that even as poor as I do run it sometimes then I wouldn't do it like that how about God so God had the inheritance all prepared for you before you were born he knew who was going to receive it he had it all planned out so if we just meditate on some of those scriptures that we read last time last last Sunday in Proverbs 13 it says a good man leaveth that inheritance to his children's children and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just and Ephesians 1 says in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who work with all things after the counsel of his own will in Ephesians Verse 18 says the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints so God wants us to know what our inheritance is he just doesn't want us to go stumbling around wondering what we have access to and I believe when you when you realize what you're what you have what you should have a right to then you'll do like you do like Caleb did and say I'm going to fight for my Mountain because it's mine you you have a right to it in Titus for chapter three he said that being justified by his grace we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life and Romans 8 says and if children then heirs Heirs of God and Joint heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together in Luke chapter 12 there's an interesting story about an inheritance and and Jesus tells this story he said as he was you know speaking to the crowd one of the companies said I need a master speak to my brother that he divide the inheritance with me so there's a somebody in the in the crowd talking to Jesus and he's got a situation where his his his parents or his fathers died or whatever the situation is and now there's a little argument over who gets the inheritance and he said unto him man who made me a judge or a divider over you and he said unto them take heed and beware of covetousness for a man's life consists not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth so now he's he's shifting their thinking from from things carnal to to things spiritual you you think your inheritance is you're so worried about how much money or land you're going to get but what about what about where your soul is going to go when you die and he spake a parable unto them saying the ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully and he thought within himself saying what shall I do because I have no room where to bestow my fruits and he said this what I do I will pull down my Barns and build greater and then will I bestow all my fruits and my goods he was so concerned with the natural that he was going to go out and I got to build a bigger Barn so I'm going to tear down what I've got and build something greater and I will say to my soul Soul thou has much Goods laid up for many years take thine ease eat drink and be merry but God said unto him thou fool this night thy Soul shall be required of thee then whose shall those things be which thou has provided so is he that layeth up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God now see he wanted he was so concerned about uh uh uh the the things of this Earth and then Jesus began to tell a parable about somebody that thought he was going to have a lot of years left a lot uh uh uh many many more years to to kind of enjoy the fruits of his labors and all the those big barns that he built and that night he died what's your inheritance your inherence is your inheritance in Christ is eternal life there's another another Parable that in Mark chapter 10 when he was going forth out of the way there came one running and kneeled him and asked him good Master what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life and Jesus said unto him why call us thou me good there's none good but one that is God they all know it's the Commandments do not commit adultery they're not killed and I steal do not bear false witness they're for all not honor thy father and mother and he answered and said unto him master all these have I observed for my youth then Jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing thou lack us go thy way so whatsoever thou Hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me and he was sad at that saying and went away grieved for he had great possessions a lot of stuff on Earth but what about in heaven and Jesus looked around about and saith unto his disciples how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God now what makes it hard for a rich man to see because you're looking around at all the positions all the stuff you got you got you can one one click you can buy something on Amazon you can sit in your easy chair and not even get up when the postman brings your box to your door and you've got all those things and you can you you you are it's so easy in this layout of CNAs to get our mind off of off of off of what's really important to lay up your Treasures in Heaven and that's why Jesus said where your treasure is that's where your heart is if you're if you're so concerned about the natural life then you're not going to be concerned about the spiritual life but if you're concerned about eternal life then a lot of times the things of this Earth will begin to fade away in Matthew 19 he said then answered Peter and said well unto him behold what we have forsaken all and follow thee what shall we have therefore what are we going to get are we going to get uh you know who knows where his mind was going and Jesus said unto them verily I say unto you that ye which have followed me and the Regeneration when the son of man shall sit in the Throne of his glory he also shall sit upon twelve Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel and everyone that had forsaken houses or Brethren her sisters her father a mother or wife or children or lands for my namesake shall receive in hundred hundredfold and shall inherit everlasting life but many that are first shall be last and the last shall be first and then he goes on to talk about the 11th Hour worker but in Revelations chapter 21 tells you what you're going to inherit he that over overcometh shall inherit all things now that's a pretty good selling point for the gospel isn't it if you can overcome your pride and your ego and the things of this life the trials of Life and Overcoming Christ and get get in Christ be born again you're going to inherit all things amen what does inherit mean inherent means to receive a lot like uh somebody dies and they're going to say this one's going to get this this is going to get this and so when when uh when the when the wheel is red when the testament's read you hear your name called and oh great I get this this is what you're going to get to receive the portion assigned to you now so you're a portion your portion is is what all these scriptures that we've just been reading to receive an allotted portion receive as one's own or as a possession to become partaker of to obtain so your inheritance means that it's yours you you have access to it you it wouldn't it be great if you were listening to to the law you read the will or whatever and they say well you gotta you got a new house or or and then you you'd go out of there skipping with joy because wow I've got I've got some money or I've got a new car or whatever well that's uh think about how Joyful We should be when we realize what God has given to us now now here's a great definition of inheritance from the Cambridge Dictionary definition an inheritance is money land or possessions received from someone after the person has died but it also means the characteristics received from your parents through their genes now you think about how that we've inherited through Christ we've inherited all things but we've inherited his characteristics through the new birth that his he will change our thinking and change our life to be like him change change it change our makeup so that we're actually the the manifestation of Christ in this age and the age that we're living in so in Galatians chapter 4 Paul said even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because you are Sons God had sent forth a spirit of his son into your hearts crying I have a father wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ so by the new birth we have access to all these promises that that God has has laid out for us foreign and in Romans chapter 8 verse 15 also now you think about uh an heir a joint Heir just to actually sit on the throne with Christ and be an heir to everything jointly with him now I I got an example as an example you know I don't watch the royal family or whatever but it's just something to kind of think about as an example um you this these are all the Heirs of the royal family over there in England and so you know the queen just died and sold out now Prince Charles and he's now the king um and and he's got he's got everything that the queen had because it was it was it was her wheel or whatever and uh so he's got he's got the throne he's got the kingdom he's he's got he's inherited everything that goes with that title of being the the monarchy of the king of England and now all of these people here are in line uh Prince William he's going to be next in line if if King Charles were to die if if Charles dies then the Testament will go you've got access to everything that I had you've got my name you've got my title you've got all the benefits and privileges there too and all the way down to this little fella who's sitting there I think his name is George if I remember right and uh now now George he's a little fella so he's got he's got to come to a place where he can know what to do with all that now that's the same way that God does with us he doesn't just pile it on to you all at once he starts off a little bit by giving you the near birth and you grow into it so that you have uh to see that you're going to be responsible you know that I I I think it's interesting how that even that royal family over there they put their kids through school and they they make them go to the military and fly a helicopter or whatever so they nerd they start building some character they know they're not just um necessarily just spoiled brats they uh they they've been they they know how to conduct themselves and how to how to serve the people the people and that kind of stuff so you know brother Raymond said in the return in Jubilee He said yes sir it's time to return return to what brother random return back to the organization I come out of no return back to your inheritance The Inheritance that our father left us how did we what kind of an inheritance did he leave weight ye and the City of Jerusalem until you're endued with power from on high that's the inheritance not go join this one and go join that one go join this one wait till the power wait till the power comes from on high how long until one day two days wait until don't take some little emotion some little frustration wait there until you are dead and buried and born again or at the new Anew in Christ Jesus and every pulsation of your life beats out Jesus Christ so you can see the Life of Christ reflected right in your living the way you go yes sir till you can find that power like they had back there in the beginning because that's your inheritance in Christ the same life the same power you're going to do the Greater Works because he said he said that's that's your inheritance the signs and wonders will follow them that believe that's your inheritance because eternal life in Christ is your inheritance so just like little King George you you start off with the down payment of your of that the earnest of your inheritance in Ephesians chapter 1 verse 14. says in whom you also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation and whom also after that you believed you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory now brother Brown said to hear ye him in the Old Testament a father owned a great portion of ground and he had hired servants all around little places and houses or tents that watched over his flock now when a child was born into this home the father did not have time to take care of the son the way that he should so he'd go and hire a tutor or a razor someone to educate the child all right here's where I think that the Pentecostal Church made their mistake when that son was born into the family he was a son at Birth but his inheritance was not yet determined it depended on his character so though being a son than if he was a disobedient son he would not inherit anything but still he was a son but if he was an obedient son he was heir to all things and we've been taught not only through Pentecostal Realms but through the Holiness group and the Baptist and what more that when we're born again we're sons of God that's true but that yet that's just the beginning then it's your character from then on what means the difference now everything here's another I'm just running through some examples of getting your inheritance and the Bible talks about every the shemitah was every seven years and you'd get you'd get to uh somebody that was uh out of their inheritance would would be able to go partially free every seven years your debts would be forgiven the ad the land would lie follow and the private land Holdings could be go back to to sale and Staples such as food stores and perennial Harvest to be freely redistributed and accessible to all and and if you if you went into into bondage with uh where the having married a wife previously then you could go back to that wife but if you married a wife that was a slave while you were during that seven years you cannot take that wife with you and those kind of things but after at the end of the 50 years now I'm going I know I'm kind of running through fast but I'm just kind of summarizing The Inheritance at the end of the uh in Leviticus 25 it says Thou shalt number seven sevenths of sabbaths of years under these seven times seven seven years in the space of the seven sabbaths of his years shall be unto thee 40 and nine years then shalt thou cause a number of the The Trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month and the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land so when that trumpet sounded you could go completely back to your inheritance I see that's typing what brother random's message was to to bring us back to the original Faith to original to the original possession of what you're to to take you back to full inheritance now we're speaking of inheritance full inheritance full inheritance is not just Redemption of your soul but full inheritance takes you all the way back to to full communion with Christ which is that slide we were looking at last last uh last Sunday where full inheritance takes you back to eternal life and the mind and body and subject to the word and the virtues of God on display all of this and speaking conditions and one is in communion with God and a supernatural understanding of Supernatural things and the ability to discern truth from error no matter how close it is and and fortification behind God's word because God's going to have a bride that won't be like Eve that she's not going to be fooled by something the devil tells her and an anointed life and dominion over the Earth and full Redemption for soul spirit and body Christ completely manifested in you and all the way to a body change now see that's a summary of what your inheritance is so now that was going back to this story that I kind of alluded to earlier that in Joshua chapter 14 when they when they came out uh crossed over the river Jordan the children of Judah came unto Joshua and gilgal and Caleb the son of jeffon of the kennesite said unto him thou knowest the thing that the Lord said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee and kadish barnia 40 years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from kiddis barnegata to spy out the land and I brought him word again as it was in my heart nevertheless my brother that went up with me made the heart of the people melt but I wholly followed the Lord my God and Moses swear on that day saying surely the land World thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance and thy children forever because thou has holy fall of the Lord my thy God and now behold the Lord have kept me alive as he said these 40 and five years even since the Lord spake this word unto Moses while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness and now lo I am this day four score and five years old as yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me as my strength was then even so was my strength now for war both to go out and to come in now therefore give me this mountain where the Lord speak in that day for thou hardest in that day how the anakims were there and that the cities were great and fenced if so be the Lord will be with me then I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord said and Joshua blessed him and gave unto Caleb the son of jafana Hebron for an inheritance so when Joshua gave Caleb that land that was his and just like when you read in the Bible the things that are yours if it says it's yours then you have access to it but you got to fight for it like Caleb did there's there's going to be times where you get on your knees and you struggle and you read through your Bible to be sure that that's what you have access to but if the Bible says it you can claim it you've got a right to it and why do you have a right to it that's what Paul was talking about here when Paul Jesus died so that you you could your inheritance could be expressed in you so that you could have access to it he died so that so when you read in the Bible the reading the Bible is the reading of the will the will is laid out for you hearing the pages of the Bible and when you open it up and it becomes real to you you've got access to it it's yours maybe as the preaching of the word Goes Forth today and as you leave the building maybe uh something was a special will ring in your heart to know that that these things that we're hearing about are not just vain promises but that Christ died for died for us to have access to them so if we go back to the scripture that we just read it says in verse 15 for this calls he is the mediator of the New Testament that by and remember my mediator is one that stands between but also the mediator is the one the one that's going to to to make a he he is the one that's going to see that the things that are spoken of are going to come to pass that's the mediator's job the mediator is going to say well he's not just a a between uh between the two the two opposing things uh he's not just going to resolve the conflict but he's going to stand there and make sure that that Testament is fulfilled that by means of death for the Redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of Eternal inheritance for where our testimony is there must also a necessity be the death of the testator for a testament is a force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth I see you that the pattern is repeated all through the scripture in the Old Testament the Old Testament was in effect after the death of the animal in the New Testament The Testament is in effect after the death of Christ in the Old Testament that's what Paul as he keeps going on he says whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood but when Moses has spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of calves and of goats for the water and Scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both a book and all the people saying this is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you why did he sprinkle the book because that's your will and that will is going to come into effect in Exodus chapter 4 Moses took the blood and sprinkled it on the people and said behold the blood of the Covenant which the Lord hath made with you concerning all these works and Hebrews 9 if we keep reading only he says moreover he sprinkled both with blood both a tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood is no remission now when you when when the blood is shed you've got you've got something that you can you can have confidence in blood is light it's the life of the in the Old Testament the life of the animal was shed the New Testament the life of God will shed and that life is going to come back in The Believer through the through the new birth but around said and inside he said the penalty is death and something has to die to pay that penalty so it can only be substitutionary or or all in death if there wasn't a substitute for us to hold on to and man in doing this realize that that he needs something to hold on to something that he can put his hands on something he can say this is it I've got it I know it's it so and identify with Christ but around said in the Old Testament when a man wants to be identified at the house of God he took the most innocent thing he could find a lamb and he know the lamb was free from sin because it knowed no sin and he went and took the lamb and put his hand upon his head and confessed his sin and by faith he transferred his sins on the lamb and the innocence of the Lamb back on him and then the lamb died because it was a sinner and the man lived by an Act of Faith of obeying what God's in now let's see when you put your hands on that on that lamb in the Old Testament it's all that blood running through it you could say running down off off of lamb you can say this is it my sins are gone but what did he do he went right back out of the temple with the same desire he had when he come in because when that blood set was broken which the Life Starts in one blood cell and when that blood cell was broken the life of the Lamb would not coincide or come back into the human life because it was an animal life The Man Without with the same desire he had so therefore he committed sins continually all the time again the musicians can go ahead and come forward but see now in the New Testament it's going to change the believer it's going to change you but there coming time when God made us an example and he gave us the Lord Jesus and when a sinner puts his hands upon his precious head and confesses his sins and his sins is transformed or transferred from The Sinner to Jesus and the innocence of Jesus is transferred by the Holy Ghost back into that person he's a new creature in Christ Jesus that's where I want to be identified the Bible said he knowing no sin was made sin for us the reason he suffered was for our sins and it's no more than what is right no more than our duties to look at these things and see that these desires that we have that God put in us to create in us to make us to want to be like him that's your inheritance that God would change your desire to be like him and to want to be like him to forsake the things of this world you've got access to these things that divine
