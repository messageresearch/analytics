now the announcements have been made that we will be having the Spring Festival this coming Saturday starting at 1:00 and so remember that and then remember the other announcements Mississippi we have some more but just Pratt the Lord would bless each and every one of us remember all the ones that are sick and are not here among us in judgment Lord we do I would like for you to do something in farm of course it's hard to do but it's just a joke anyway but could everybody move over a little bit toward the wall it just kind of move over toward the wall now I'm trying to illustrate something you see how many seats it would be extra if everybody made sure they took a bath on Sunday and used the odorant you know and everything and they would make room for more people because we do have a problem here that we want to sit down and go you know like this and it makes it a little bit more inconvenient you know to do that now that's one of those things I was missing it to my nephew the other day I said we got to do something I said the church is getting so full we don't have no room he said that's a problem you know to him it hit men of joy he said that's a problem that's a deal you can get back over again ain't nobody coming in but that's just what I mean that if you see an opportunity to be able to change things maybe families learn to set together our to do or whatever we try to reserve some of the back for the little children because that's just the opportunity but we're not down and out about it we're enjoy but what can we do about it we'd like to have a bigger place but that's just not in the in the makings you know to where we could do that so we just have to maybe sit a little closer together you know and put mark and his brother right together you know or that they do favor anyway so we can do that but just in just to do that and we're glad for that to be it you know to do and you you've already prayed I know for sister Freda did she come on up that she was having trouble with her sugar and I don't know where she come on in the building and whatever but we prayed and we believe everything he'll be all right so remember that okay so we eat we've got all the announcements mate all right so let's just go right on the end of the scripture and let the Lord have his way with each one father we thank you for the day and the grace that you've given unto us the hour that we have upon the earth and we pray that you would just got each and every one of us and let us Lord walking you and help us to to look to you the author and finisher of our faith and to know that you are the one to guide each and every one of us have your way remember the sick ones among us Lord there's many different ones that are sick and and everything in aids getting on to us and things Lord we ask you to just hasten the day and get us out of here we pray for you to come quickly because we see the things coming to pice that are supposed to be there in the end time the world and the situation the religious world city the things Lord and we ask you to just come quickly and get us out of this we love you and we thank you in Jesus name Amen revelations 21 and I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth was passed away and there was no more sea and I John solved the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband remember John explains the bride like the city and explains a city like a bride because it goes together alright and I heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things the ones are passed away whatever caused it all of this pain problem heartache trouble death etc by this time that's gone alright so we'll keep that in your mind now and either set up on the throne said behold I make all things new and said unto me write for these words are true and faithful you may be seated to the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now we'll get to that scripture in a moment and try to talk on these things a little bit but what I want you to do is to make sure we've had quite a few services talking about the all in all and I hope you've enjoyed it but to me you know I'm just to this point of view that when you say the all and in all we know that it doesn't mean that he's in everybody now but he ever born-again believer any were see which would be the bride with eternal life then that's the all and all alright now then we covered that when you come to the next stage of your form of redemption you've got you feel feel jus that would come up and see then he's all and all to them because he didn't with them according to what he's revealing himself to them the redemption you know being redeemed all right now see then we went through covering that 144,000 because the fish feel Jewett says in Revelation six eleven you know that they get white robes and are told to wait until their fellow brethren now you may find a quote of stating that the officials you or people that you were looking at it you may find a quote Darfur the Prophet saying that that that would be the white throne where they'd get their white robes but remember what the Bible says the Bible says for them to rest and white robes were given unto them the until your fellow brethren and the Prophet said that's your 144,000 that are killed all right so just keep that in mind as a reason we covered that away but it's the plan of redemption for different people that's what I've been trying to express so you can take the all and all to the bride dinner and that's all he's all and he's in all he'll be in everyone that is given eternal life alright then when you come to the field field you that's a special group of people that will be given eternal life but remember what we were talking about it last night the Bride of Christ is the only group I covered I think four groups but the Bride of Christ is the only group that there's no death to it she's going to be changed now we may die but somebody in the bride is going to be changed and don't have to die but for redemption from there on out anybody that saved on Pais the bride across they have to die the fields you dies $144,000 the two witnesses die the foolish virgins die so that's why I was covering the all and in all because each time he imparts eternal life and he doesn't impart eternal life to the bride you know wait a minute well just listen to what were saying he doesn't impart it's not an impartation to you and me he imparted to Adam and Eve eternal life but we receive eternal God life by the process of redemption that we go through of justification sanctification baptism with the Holy Ghost and we receive it from that alright but do you get what I'm saying then see they know all in all it's the bride okay then you can say they all in all is the fulfills you to be given eternal life then you say they all in all is 144,000 because he's still dealing with redemption right see if you just say redemption for us you know where I gave you a quote derp ssundee that brother run says now these redeemed he said but he said that's not the bride he said the brides in the city well I see everything can be anybody that ever gets eternal life will be redeemed from a situation that they existed in and brought forth in to eternal life right all right but there's covering it or you get it all laid in order and then you don't cross up your your examples in the scriptures and see then you can cover the bride then you can cover the white the fear fills you then you cover the 144,000 in their Redemption then you cover the foolish version that's why thrown to be given eternal life but when the white throne judgment is done that's the life's redemption there is no redemption theis the white throne well I don't like you call that a watch on the rejection well you tell me what it is they're safe from their sins they're given eternal life in their soul all right and see then those things are there for us to get understanding but just get the point then I'll try to move on the bride somebody you might not be but one person but somebody don't have to die because the Bible says you'd be changed the moment a twink live or die but that's not so for anybody else in any form of redemption because in any form of redemption after the end by anybody they have to die whether it be field view whether it be 144,000 whether it be the two witnesses and don't get me wrong now a big man in this message he taught her did teach that those two witnesses and and all of those others didn't have to die I said well we was in a Bible study one night or her you know point the ministers meeting I said well according to the Prophet they died and according to the Bible they died yeah well I mean did that solve the problem no called brother Sancho said it well I don't care who someone so says what when the word says it I believe the word first all right that this settled that you know we stay with that point and then we line it up with that to where we can see but get get the final point of what I'm saying when we get to that future home state all right now remember we've read it go we're gonna get to that in a second you get a new heaven and a new earth then you get a city to come down all right so everything at that point will be redeemed all right then there won't be any redemption after then it'll all be settled and over with by that time the future home comes down upon the earth the Prophet said it would land like it did on Jesus on a redeemed entire earth all right so the plan of redemption will be over when the future homelands upon this earth the whole redemptive plan of God will be finished all right and that way see then you can cover the all and all you remember how tried to explain something one time cuz this is the way I see it you take the coming of the Lord you got to come into the bride you got to come in with to Israel you got to coming in the Millennium all is the coming of the Lord well each one of those who saw but you cross this scripture up with this scripture and what have you got that's where the problem is with the people of the message they don't know the Bible so thereby not knowing the Bible they can't put it together correct and I don't mean everybody I'm just making a statement when I say that I'm not trying to show how smart I am I'm just telling you the God's honest truth if you got any sense you know it's true is that plain enough we've talked about it last night you know you don't have to tell a woman at one time right around said it's wrong war plans right he's born again well see there's any thing that we come well brother so-and-so said it's okay to cut your hair I don't care what he says the Bible says don't do it and if the Bible is in me and you if God wouldn't cut his hair God wouldn't drink smoke right now then a born-again believers not supposed to either so that solves the problem that's his blunders can be that's why I preach the way I do I don't preach hard dress and clothes well I preach the born-again experience you get born again it'll take care of the dress and hire and the clothes and then if it don't take care of it you're not born again but people don't like it that plain they want it's all choked a little you know it's too late to be soft soap just it's just plain language we either believe the Bible or we don't believe about but now you see what I'm talking about then so then that didn't end my thought it just opened up into greater things when we talk about the all and all we just get the layout of how this takes place this takes place this takes place this takes place it's all the plan of salvation it's all Redemption alright but it puts it into the degrees of where you're at see everybody's not a born-again believer everybody's not a the prop the Bride of Christ but there's Redemption forum that's one it was so much to me when when it come into the message are in 67 you know they're saying Redemption was over us according the Bible is over for the world well we see that wasn't their point that you know and like I said you can you can feel assured for one thing the people that talked that believed they were already born again all right they couldn't go admit the other part alright but now listen so that makes the all and in all in the time the future home transpires upon this earth the redemptive plan will be over with everything that will get eternal life will already have eternal life you said well this anybody there that don't have it I don't see how they can because the Bible said he makes all things new I believe when in the future home comes to this earth it'll be a total the entire redeemed earth all things will be made new and that's what we're getting at the point today to see it and if it's all made new alright see then why try to figure out all these other things accepted of what it's done when that happens it will be to that pole all right now then making that point we need to remember one thing that the Word of God is true all right I'm settled okay so then you know it'll be the Regained giving these little notes out of the way the word that I can get back to work we want to go to all right now let's go back now and as I said we're not ending the all in all we're still involved in it but we want to approach it a little different to where you can see what I'm talking about all right so let's go now back and read our scripture that we read so pull that back up number one brothers then let's read that scripture that we just read okay the revelation is 21 know what's what he says I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea all right now so the first heaven the first earth is passed away the Prophet said from the message Satan's Eden which we'll get to in a minute take it pull it up number three if they want to pull it on up since there's no more seed the first heaven and the first earth where Pyatt was passed away what was our first heavens was the millennium the millennium is to be the first heavens when it's covered it like this and you said now the first heavens was this backyard is up in the sky was a better way he's talking about a situation to explaining the scriptures all right what was our first heavens it's the Millennium because that's God ruling over earth as the first heaven because the first earth the first heaven watching now what's the first earth having an earth gonna pass away with God's words gonna bide forever and once what was the first earth was this this is the first earth where we're living the Millennium will be the first heaven that comes into view as God ruling over earth because remember the time he fabric time man failed you couldn't count it even in the garden as being a heaven so we'd go to it up in an IR we go top of this that remember what it's saying the first earth is now we're living on the first earth the first heaven is the Millennium okay but now remember the scripture the scripture says the first heaven and the first earth is passed away no no the millennium will come to an end or so will this earth as far as an end of this earth not annihilated we've we know the message here's your home right it's not Annihilator its redeemed it's changed it's made into a situation that can be used we'll get to that in a minute on what the scripture is actually saying but you understand right now what in the message what was first heaven and the first Earth were passed away what was our first heavens was the Millennium once the first earth was this it'll be renovated just like it was baptised in the days of Noah and the Reno come for the baptism she'll birth forth and come forth a new earth and not a different earth we know the message I'll not try to spend much time on that this earth is not annihilated that's the key to it see we thought when it said to having an earth advise away you know or be no more well that does wait wait it's gonna be blowed away with where we're gonna be I mean we're going to another planet and start over you know know the future homes gonna be right here right do we know the message enough for everybody understand that we don't have to worry about it this is dry here's where the new heaven is going to be this is the center of the universe oh no science says it's going to wear out here we blow the whistle Mimi I don't care what to say this is the center of the universe you know why go to ever'where God is is where the center of the universe it where's God going to be at the future oh he's gonna be right here so ever where he's at right there will be no more of that it's all be finished look I saw a new heaven and new earth first heaven the first earth was passed away there was no more sea now John saw the holy city New Jerusalem but sent him from God out of heaven there will be with our God will be with his true attributes sons and daughters but where we can fellowship with them in holiness with their lives behind it of seeing okay now going back to the scripture now go back to number one and I saw a new heaven a new earth for the first heaven and the first Earth were passed away all right there was no more sea now and I joined saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride for her husband okay like I said we've been through the whole thing that big old long word that means to redeem or change is not to annihilate this world is not to be blowed away is to be redeemed now as far as seeing on it and this is my points of defining sin as far as any oh well drilled to get all is going to be cleansed because that's mankind in their garbage alright so then that's just a point of my the way I try to illustrate what will happen the prophet covered it we don't have to worry about it the world is not going to be annihilated the same word for the world to be done away it's the same word for you in your born-again experience the same word as Toulouse the coat and let it come forth all of those the plan of redemption to be made new now watch that in a minute when we get to the definition we're to be made new he's going to redeem this earth not annihilate it because remember our bodies come out of this earth so now that's that should be enough to solve the problem of that now watch and I heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of God is with men and he was they'll dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God now all and all will be complete then remember what I said while ago everything that will ever be redeemed by the time the future home are the city lands on earth all the redemptive plan will be finished no matter what you want to bring it up it'll be finished because it's in order I'd like to do it too you know one day I'll get it to you think think of it but I'm like this I like to have things in order all right the Prophet said what's the next time rapture for the bride now I'm giving his definite he said the next thing will be the two witnesses to the Jews he said next to be the millennium which will be right at the end for week under and then would be Armageddon and then the millennium and then gog and magog and in the future home alright he gives her an order well yeah they will come up with a he'll say it like this and what people go haywire you'll say if you don't see you know more well see you in the millennium the next thing is the millennium cuz he said he'd see us in the millennium he didn't say that that's your definition as to what it is that's not what he's saying he just said if I don't see you anymore I'm like this I can say to you if I don't see you anymore I'll see you next week well you know what that means I won't say none of you till next week I mean some of you I won't say the next week it's simple but yet we we make it but the Prophet said the next thing is the woman he didn't say that he just making a statement yet we want to make it that way and try to make him to worry that he's correct and you know you're not correcting the word he's telling that's what the word says I've been out listen God shall wipe away all tears heard a great voice out of heaven behold the tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them there'll be his people and God Himself will be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears now watch what all things that are ended by the time the city lands on earth there'll be no more cry there'd be no more weeping there'll be no more death than being a Massaro there'll be no crying more pain for the former things are passed away anything in relation to any form of unhappiness whether it be crying death sorrow by the time that future home lands on this earth all that's done what a wonderful place to be living it'll be your home and you as the bride gets to stay in the city now watch and either set up on the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me write for these words are true and faithful I make all things new no as I said it's not an annihilation of the world the new birth never annihilated you it annihilated to sin in your soul right but he didn't annihilate you you're still the same person it's just a point that you don't have you know how to worry about the death right now the sorrow see no matter how much I cry out or the inwardly I'm not crying why because that's where he's living so we can take that and do it now listen that word to make new go ahead and pull up number two now remember I'll make all things new now what does that word new mean just 25:37 as respects form in other words it's gonna change in form it's talking about form it's gonna change in form look something recently made now what something new something recently made something fresh something recent something unused unworn new which was recently made and once which as recently made is superior to what it succeeds are you listening anything made it's made new it's made superior they got a new Thunderbird many years ago they come up with a new shape looking Thunderbird then 10 years ago we'll say whatever it look now which one if you want something to do for drive and and to do if you want something to look at you want the old Thunderbird if you won't something right in you want the new one right why because it supersedes what was original so look what he's gonna do to the earth he's gonna make it greater or you know then what it was the greatest we could think of the Garden of Eden will be nothing compared to the future home right code is gonna be made news he made is superior to what it succeeds as respect the substance of a new kind unprecedented which means in other words uncompelled to honor it means uncommon unheard of you know right now think about what he's saying he describes a new heaven and a new earth verse 1 because the first heaven and the first earth are passed away not an ayah lated passed away it's been redeemed alright it's going to come forth as more superior because it's going to be made new it will be a greater than anything right now see how you could go back in the Old Testament pick up when they made you know the temple in the latter temple how much was greater than the former warmer by been prettier but the latter had a lot more to do with it all right but now listen I created new heaven and a new earth he's gonna make all things new okay there'll be no sorrow no cry no death for all of those former things are passed away and he they set up on the throne I got a little comment about that about you see you don't know how when you say sitting on the throne on the throne of David I don't have any reference that there's a throne sitting there and y'all got to come and bow to the throne the throne is in your hearts your but yet there will be a place in the Millennium there will be a throne they will be a temple mate but you won't have no animal sacrifices and stuff like that in the millennial reign that's all gone oh but father me now if he said I'm gonna make all things new now the first heaven is the Millennium the first earth is now so he's going to redeem he's going to make it new he's not going to annihilate it he's going to redeem it and if he redeems it what does he do how does he redeem your soul by giving you eternal life right how is it that he's to redeem the world not making any terminal why would you not want it made eternal I'm asking you the question you know but I don't believe it's the world be made eternal I don't live well why why don't you want to believe that well I don't believe everybody will be eternal in that future home well where do you get it from I got it solved right there if there's going to be a fact that the heavens and earth is to pass away has to make all things new not annihilate it to make it new then why would we not believe that it'll all be eternal then why leave a situation that could in some way reoccur again well that's what a lot of people think see it goes to show you what you're thinking you're thinking this thing's not over with here your thinking is just started you never heard that one I've heard ministers try to explain this is just we're gonna start another world we're gonna have another City we're gonna have another this why what far you know why would you want to exist in the world it's not new or eternal why would you want to leave any telltale part of anywhere and remember gog and magog is not only an annihilation of the world systems its anihilation of the devils the demons the angels and things that went wrong see that's not happening in Armageddon Armageddon will be more like a nuclear in style world situation Gog and Magog will be destroying ever affect our thought our point of the devil and his angels well then why wouldn't you want to thank new well and what it is is just made new what's the difference with god of making something over again letting it start again or why not just make it new because listen folks I've asked you to read and listen to two things and when you do why don't you read with common sense when that world eventually strikes the eighth day there won't be no starting over 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 2 3 what is only a type that's only a type some water this thing is going to be made new and be greater than its original condition of the Garden of Eden that's the definition of the word you say yeah but it's just if you just get to listener no you're not listening you're not paying attention to the Prophet because the mankind is a told you mankind had always talked the rest of the baptism of the Holy Ghost at Jesus all you churches teach that that Jesus come and made a way for that rest to be imparted to you and I but why would they come up to a prophet and say yeah but now you've run out of your sevens one of these days ever type shadow or anything of eternal life will be annihilated when he turned a life is in full view what a beautiful place when you strike the number eight it's finished God has made all things new everything's not made new when you stand under seven seven forty-nine that's just a repeat you just start over you start over your prophet didn't cover that future home I've asked you to read it and listen to it read it over and over and study it why would they say you have run out of tops because see that's their tops their tops top the baptism the Baptist Church taught the the the rest day that Jesus was talking about coming to me all ye that labor and heavy laden I'll give you rest the Baptist Church people thought that was the new birth they might not have understood a lot about it but they called it your church world teaches it but they teach it and it ends with a seven because they just started over one two three four five six seven one two three four five six one two three four five six that's only attacks when you're dealing on the top remember the top is not always perfect because this watch the top would you see there is an eighth day there is an eternal life why because it's when I always make new when all is in all and finish standing in the future home all is made new everybody that would ever get eternal life is there so maybe outside the city if someone be do this that's alright they can be a day and night there that's alright but no that's what I want to get to now not in the city not in this city he said well candidly if it's day and night that's dark no oh you're not listening you think you got it but you're missing it what was the first thing God created we covered this a little bit last night I told you I was gonna get on it today what is the first creation okay I got the quotes in here so don't worry about I'll give it to you the run said God is his first creation now God never had a beginning so get the idea out of your mind of something having a beginning but God started condescending right exactly right now remember now we're gonna read in a little bit that there's no need of the moon no need of the Sun right what when the prophets describing that God's first creation was God himself that's not talking about something that it didn't exist but come in to exist it's something that was existing but yet could not be comprehended and when it's brought out into the open because he God is a spirit Jesus was human flesh to come to do what come to make the father known what's the first creation of God God himself that's what your prophet I'll give it to it we just remember he's talking about God condescending he's not talking about a beginning because God had no beginning and remember he always was the word so now when I get down to the point of saying the word was first don't think that the word didn't exist with him before the world that's the scripture in the beginning was the word Word was with God and the Word was God what a run said in the beginning without him well ahem was with God and L ahem was God that don't forget now don't forget we're still talking about the all and all I'm just trying to express it in another way or you'll understand what it means now think about it first heaven for as Earth passed away all right let me see if I can okay I placed forward now let's jump over this five what is the first creation what did brother Brown say the first crease what he said gods first crazy all right now let's read it in another phone there's questions and answers a 1953 okay look pull it on the doctor here they asked him what connection does Genesis 1:9 26 how to do Genesis 2 you know what he says he's explained one's a natural man the others a spiritual man now listen look what I said if you notice in creation the first thing that was created of course was light you come on down through the creation the last thing created was like a man what's God's first creation he said well it was himself that's light as I said don't get your mind tied up even you think creation you're thinking something that didn't exist and all at once it comes into existence that's not a new creation the first thing is like okay go ahead to number six then God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and caused a lot day and the darkness he called night in the evening in the morning were the first day turnover number seven okay and God said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons for days and years and let them be lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth and it was so and God made two great lights the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night and he made the stars also and God set them in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth and to rule over the day and over the night and divided the light from the darkness and God saw that was good and the evening in the morning were the fourth day what did he create on the first day do you automatically think he created the Sun in the moon when the first day he did do it he created the Sun in the moon in the fourth day we're reading Bible so what was that light then in verse one you know it says that in the beginning God created heaven terror and Erik was without form and void he doing no case if the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of it now why does it say darkness darkness is an absence of light right so when God said let there be light was he creating the moon in the Sun no he was bringing forth light of understanding it's not that it was dark because the Bible said in him is no darkness who ever worked God ever existed there's no darkness so he said - let there be light and then words let light come forth in a manifestation like I told him life not you closes that room off totally black that's what you call darkness strike one match you put out the whole darkness this in the room right see it's expressing how that God is going to unveil himself to be seen there was never a time that God existed in darkness they can't be any darkness - God those God is light and in him is no darkness so it's exactly right the first thing was light now come on ain't gonna get to it normal not to go so far at all we just remember I said we were still on the all and it all remember I thought we could bad this Talde that the Bible says you're the light of the world did the Bible say that you are the light of the world so he didn't create light light always was God because God is light and in him there is no darkness it's not explaining differences well the dark world was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and you know it's not explaining a situation of a great darkness when all at once it starts coming for the light or what didn't he wait till the 4th day and use it with the Sun and the moon and in case you had never thought about it I thought we believed that the moon has no light it's only a reflection of the Sun right no matter where it is in the world it just keeps turning this reflection of the Sun so what are you trying to get out I'm trying to get to a point to understand the all-in-all trying to get to a point to understand where brother Branham says God is not complete without you you realize if you take out that light that you have all we used to sing that song you know we live kids done it and the Baptist we live gets done it in the Methodist Presbyterian this little light of mine I'm gonna let it shine what light was we talking about are supposed to been talking about see then when the Prophet says that God's first creation was himself he didn't create something to come into light he didn't make like he always existed his light in him as the light and there's no darkness he didn't have to come into a being it wasn't dark and it automatically made light it's a it's the technical point showing you because why didn't he wait to the fourth day and let the Sun handle it because he that Sun was a different light the Sun was a creation of light all right are you in the the Sun was a creation of light light was not a creation light was Almighty God see we used to talk about it the badness right well yet that were the light of the world let your light shine don't put it under a bushel don't put it over let your light shine go you're the light no see we believe God was like we didn't believe where's the light we believe God was like but we didn't accept the fact that we were like but only way we could be light was have mercy have him in us Jesus was describing the new birth or the scripture was it brings us to the same light that he is and we don't need to moon to the Sun one day the moon in the Sun won't have to exist for you and me there'll be no light I'm getting this point then we'll just drop it by there'll be no need of the moon and the stars or the Sun in the city maybe outside yeah you can all day or night you can have all in thought but if you have day and night is the darkness going to be now let me say something to you listen the Sun is to make the day right the moon is to make the night then moon reflects the light of the Sun so it will never be dark again well because the moon is shining now let's don't get into technical points the Rose lives up here of this light dark in that light just listen see that's what you do you say something you don't understand the roar and I said what does that word for it where's never darting or not you know stay the same I'll wait don't get into silliness listen to what's being said as long as the moon is in existence reflecting the light of the Sun that will never be a darkness upon the earth yeah but clouds get that's what I'm selling you see you've got it all figured out you ever taste darkness comes across them this is when the darkness comes across when you have an eclipse and the coast totally dark does that put out the Sun okay there we're sitting there and this this is gonna come okay and God just goes click what a switch and he turns off the Sun so you're not you're not thinking in so matters you're thinking with a human mind of capacity to try to understand you're trying to make an answer but just remember once that Sun was created it will never stop shining once the moon was brought into existence to relate the light reflect the light of the Sun it will never stop so you can have new moons and all kind of thing outside the city but I'm talking about in the city there's no need of the light right what is it no license six and it ain't six six and eleven is that worth that the old minute just not that you know what is it come see the lamb I'll get back to it because I want to pick it up later anyway the lamb is the light of the city now does his gut light go out you know when he walks outside the city then you're the light does your light go out and you walk in darkness you say yeah but you you sound like you're talking about we're gonna be a lightning bubs you know lightning Burt what did it you know where the flick at nights you don't lightning bugs ain't talking stupid I'm talking spiritual when the Bible says you're the light of the world it's not talking about you're going to be glowing oh I can just see it bright they saw me down there one day and they saw a lot all the way around I was just glowing they may be true but that ain't what I'm talking about I'm talking about God is light there never was a time that he was in darkness there was no darkness darkness is an absence of light show me word could ever be dark well you don't sound like you believe in the dark nor not anymore no cuz that come on over the fourth day when he started needing it the first day he created light in other words God brought himself from us not being able to see him or comprehending him and understanding anyway he brought light the light is the one that said let there be not to sign it come on up with our four days three or four days later well I never thought about I thought that first creation was the moon and stars and the Sun that he what the Bible says the Bible says four days later finally come the Sun and the moon the gods first creation was himself condescending down it out of a total existence of the purities of all light that could ever be comprehended with a mortal mind God would begin to step down and he would know that there was going to be a day and a night there was no day in not in the eternal heavens where God existed alone as the self existing one there was no night and day night and day begin to develop into existence into the fourth day when he created the Sun the rule over the day he was bringing it in to physical manifestation God is light and in him there is no darkness you're the light of the world you realize what sort of trouble to take play like wait talking about the tribulation and the thing you realize why it's gonna come tribulation there's a wrath of God poured out on the earth you realize the reason it's poured out why cuz all the light's gone ever born again believer leaves for the tribulation takes blood though then it can go into darkness but it won't go into darkness because the moon will still be that the Sun would still be shining right so in his creation he had to create and not to be a creation like this piece of paper that was once a tree or something like that but it was changed and brought down and finally made to paper there is no darkness to God I love the way the Prophet explains it go take it take the words in your your meaning of it says he's the Alpha and Omega the beginning in the end he's the root and offering he's everything who is he he's light and in him is no darkness but he didn't have to create something it was the higher before anything ever existed God dwelt alone right you see we're not listening to all the things the prophets say it we're listening to what we want to them and say well see there there was a time that he was self-existing could he self existed this if I sell you see we failed to read the rest of it then he dwelt alone with his attributes right he dwelt along with his attributes so you gonna find out one day that all we're doing is going back where we come from in the word redeem we got to go through a process to go back to where we come from well you believe in pre existence I believe in pre existence of Almighty God I don't believe in pre existence of humanity I believe in pre existence of that eternal life that you have in you called a new birth because that was part of God before the world ever begun that was his attribute before the world ever started was that eternal out that you have you now I'll go with you when you say always was eternal because you certainly tell them about this you're talking about what's inside of you by the new birth then he had been part eternal life so what's God's first great light light three days later he creates the Sun in the moon what does he need them far for the whole world you didn't need it for where he's at you realize when he when he stepped into humanity he felt something he'd never felt because when the Sun Goes Down at night he couldn't see no better nobody else he felt something that he never felt because that light was not that flesh the light I'm talking about from the beginning is that one that dwelt in the flesh that if you receive the new birth then you're the light of the world by the born-again experience the light that God existed along with and was always and there were no darkness lives with inside of you if it lives inside of you you are the light of the world there's no need of the light in the future home they'll never be a day or not in the future home that's what your prophet said read it future home it will be no darkness dark now outside yes because that's the world and everything else but just remember one thing what if he had not of created the moon in the Stars you would have a lot in the city in the world would be now the world outside is going to exist under the situation we exist under now days and nights but just remember my illustration no matter how dark it gets the light is still reflecting from the moon you're putting clouds up and smoke or or stuff up above to cut off the ain't on my dad you know better than that that's just your terminologies of trying to say how smart you are well I figured that out Brazil didn't figure that out ain't have to figure that out it's the plain truth they'll never be a time that there never will be a darkness because even in the in the new earth it will never go back to a total darkness they will be a moon and a sun shining outside the city but inside the city you don't need no light you don't need no temple you don't need anything cuz the lamb is the light I thought we believe what the Bible says God is light and in him is no darkness it's not stopped not something that didn't exist and then it come into existence I ain't talkin about something like that God always was like he's the only life he didn't have a time that he started a flesh yes that's what's called the beginning of the creation of God revelation 3:14 and retirin said wind it out of God Christ he said only in Jesus Christ is God of creation it wasn't that God come into being no God came into eyesight or a manifestation the word he could be understood and then one day he gave you the new birth putting that same light inside of you the same light he had is inside of you what does that make you remember the story still is all in all remember the point is still all in all the light has shined upon God's Word to reveal God to mankind the best you can do you take self-existing and when you take self-existing be careful because you just took yourself out of being if you don't understand how to do that if he's self existing and he existed alone then where were we before the world we better believe we were in him as part of God a part of eternal life living in God and attribute a thought and he said let there be and we come into existence he had no one to create him he was the creator he had nobody to turn a light switch and make it light to where you could see he was the light he doesn't need that there'll be no need of none of that in the city because in the city will be total light no matter what it is outside day or night URI time come on kids Jonah Thomas back there he he likes a nightlight in his bedroom right what about the kids you want to not lot how many grown-ups got night lights you got a note I see some lands right now better over there some of you grown-ups need a nightlight but what about a time when you don't need no light at all but just remember as I said while ago when he walks out of that city he don't turn the light speech never where he's at it always will be light but just remember if you're born again believer then there's no darkness in you then everywhere you go is a lot we used to sing it this little out of mind I'll let it snow what are we talking about doing let it's time to others that they may see put it under a bushel no we don't want to cover it up we want to let it be seen because we're the light you see why he's not complete without you could you visualize for a second 10 billion little light bulbs and all that would be representing God and all at once one of them goes out and show up this Purdy's kabir wouldn't that ain't the way God is right they said I had plenty of time this morning because of Lisa Tim's going after the food no what about it what do you think about light if I got a question what do you think about light light had no beginning the moon and the stars did so that's not the light you're talking about if God lives in you that light is in you there's no need of the light you don't have to have a lot in this city but you didn't listen to what I was saying on the other this two men show you how carnal you can get you say well the clouds come over and with darkness just remember in the future home there'll be no clouds there will be no mushrooms going up there'll be no no fog there'll be no more deaths out of the other it'd all be new will be no volcanoes erupting and covering the earth with ice they'll all be made new thing will be no darkness in the world no matter what not becomes it with his dire when the Prophet is describing the future home and he said now outside of the city that inside the city you know how no need of the light he said that outside the city you'll have your stars your moon and but just remember the day he created that natural Sun from that day till now it ain't stopped glowing I ain't gonna stop glowing when we get there it'll keep glowing because there'll never be a darkness as one match in a you know ten thousand foot building totally dark and one match lit it puts out all that darkness same thing would be if a born-again believer everywhere you walk there's light you're the light you realize what that makes us a part of God right if he's like then we're part of God see what the world's looking at you for they wanting to see Jesus right what if we're not letting our light shine then we're creating darkness but don't forget this light is not a creation life is God God never had a beginning to condescend Awards earth that we could see him a human flesh yes are the manifestations of different ways of seeing through son of man son of God son of David all of that but just remember each one of those son of God listening we're still on it son of man son of God son of David each one of them is related to your Redemption you're not something that needs to be sitting on the throne in the Millennium that's the throne of David it won't be David sitting there it be the Lord Jesus that night why don't you put David up dark wrong man David ain't got enough light he sits on that throne you realize we'll be right there with him take out one of those lives that aggravates me to look at a thing like these lights here got four in there now looking at one of them I'll I want to go change that light bub why because I want to see the light you see he's the light but he gave his own life to live in you and I now we're the life the world is looking for a light he realized the life you live before the people around you is the only god they'll ever see they ain't never been able to read his Bible and find him you seen you well because you're the light right you realize when we get out of here watch the all in all when we get out of here there'll be a field you that will be given white robe when they leave they be 144,000 given eternal life when they leave there be a white room each one of them will become light that the all and although may be here all and in all a light is not made to be covered over go let your light shine I thought we believe in live being revelation of what we do Co musicians come on we're gonna have a dinner today when they get here with it no they may be so we'll go ahead and tell you a little bit evening we may have to change just a little bit of the time wise to starting an evening to make sure we have enough time to eat cause it's my birthday party we have

make it a little more simple how much more simple can I make it then a Baptist doctrine that was preached to me 50 years 60 years ago or 70 years ago this little light of mine I'm gonna let it shine we understood them scriptures back to our the world of no by new creature a new creation God didn't how no beginning he never had a beginning but he did dwell alone with his attributes one day they were made manifest and doing it will sink a little bit if anybody has a need you have a need [Music] let your light shine new creation I'm a brand new man I'm a new creation [Music] you just let

bring it all the way through his word and bringing it down to show the light and let him stand there well yet what did they do beat him killed him but he was still alive he was still alive he is still that light and in him there's no darkness whatsoever take that new birth and go forth with a better thought or idea about what you're doing let your light shine that others may see Jesus Christ [Music] just be with their little sister anybody else you see he never had a beginning so he can't have an Indian but see it's hard to comprehend to him in mind with the human mind how that one time he was bottled up in human flesh he had to bathe with the flesh and live by the flesh but inside of him was Almighty God there the very light of the world they tried their best to put him out but they couldn't do it Satan had been better off he went on vacation as the old saying goes and left them disciples alone because it was just one lot the first thing you know that 120 next thing you know there's 3,000 and look how he's multiplying that light is getting greater it's not going deal don't I mean it you know doll die on that's not it's more light the more of God has shown forth the more
