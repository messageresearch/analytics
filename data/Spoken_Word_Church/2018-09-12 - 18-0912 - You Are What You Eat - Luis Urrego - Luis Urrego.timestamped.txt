[4:11] maybe geared more to our young people
[4:13] and your children so children young
[4:16] people pay attention listen and
[4:19] hopefully you get something out of it
[4:21] amen but it's gonna supposed to benefit
[4:24] each and every one of us amen because
[4:26] the word is the word Amen I you know
[4:30] we're all supposed to be going to a
[4:31] great youth camp some day right
[4:37] that's what I tell I've told some of the
[4:40] older ones here before I said look
[4:42] you're not getting older you're just
[4:43] getting younger really they are they may
[4:48] not feel it right now in this outer
[4:49] shell but really a man
[4:53] they're rejuvenating amen and what
[4:55] rejuvenates us is this word amen praise
[4:58] God it's a hope that we have in this
[5:00] word amen praise the Lord Jesus so also
[5:03] just pray for those who like brother
[5:05] Wade said pray for those people there in
[5:07] the coast of South Carolina and those
[5:09] people that are traveling trying to get
[5:11] out you just remember the situation
[5:12] because there's churches in that area
[5:14] and things and so we have believers and
[5:18] brothers and sisters in Christ in those
[5:20] areas as well so remember them in prayer
[5:23] amen so right now let's just forget
[5:26] about Hurricane Florence forget about
[5:28] you thing else let's go to the word amen
[5:29] let's concentrate on the word that's so
[5:32] let's let's go to John chapter 6 and I
[5:34] want to start from verse
[5:36] twenty-seven John chapter six verse 27
[5:44] amen
[5:45] I know I gave them in the back a
[5:47] different scripture but I'm gonna read
[5:49] three verses before that and then and
[5:51] then I'll get to the ones that I told
[5:53] him back there John chapter 6 verse 27
[5:57] says labor not for the meat which
[6:00] perishes but for that meat which
[6:04] endureth unto everlasting life amen
[6:08] which the Son of man shall give unto you
[6:11] for him hath God the Father sealed so in
[6:15] other words Jesus is saying here don't
[6:17] work so hard for food or for that those
[6:21] things in life they are going to perish
[6:24] anyways amen don't expect CA yourself
[6:28] with those things there are just gonna
[6:30] perish anyways don't consume yourself
[6:34] with those things that are just gonna
[6:35] perish anyways amen but labor for those
[6:38] things that endure with everlasting life
[6:41] amen
[6:42] praise God now let's skip down to verse
[6:43] 33 it says in the same chapter verse 33
[6:46] for the bread of God is he which cometh
[6:49] down from heaven and giveth life unto
[6:52] the world and we know that that's Jesus
[6:54] Christ amen
[6:55] verse 35 and jesus said unto them I am
[6:59] the bread of life he that cometh to me
[7:02] shall never hunger my what a promise and
[7:06] he that believeth on me shall never
[7:10] thirst it says never so that means I
[7:14] believe what he says Amen praise God now
[7:18] let's go down to verse 48 you can read
[7:21] this there hold this this whole chapter
[7:24] in your home and it's very good amen
[7:28] verse 48 says I am that Bread of Life
[7:30] so here's Jesus reiterating I am that
[7:33] Bread of Life verse 51 I am The Living
[7:37] bread which came down from heaven and If
[7:39] any man eat of this bread he shall live
[7:42] forever and the bread that I will give
[7:45] is my flesh which I will give for the
[7:48] life of the world
[7:49] now let's go to verse 53 this is what I
[7:53] gave them back there then jesus said
[7:55] unto them verily verily I say unto you
[7:57] except ye eat the flesh of the Son of
[8:00] Man and drink his blood you have no life
[8:05] in you what kind of kinetic code kind of
[8:08] cannibalism what is that word
[8:10] cannibalism is he talking about here you
[8:13] forgive me you know I'm not from America
[8:15] so I was English is not my first
[8:18] language
[8:19] I'm from way down south verse 54 whoso
[8:24] eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood
[8:26] hath eternal life a man and I will raise
[8:30] him up at the last day so ya son of God
[8:34] has eternal life is gonna continue
[8:37] eating that flesh and drinking that
[8:39] blood amen
[8:40] for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood
[8:42] is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh
[8:45] and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and
[8:48] I in him
[8:49] if you don't dwell on him you won't be
[8:52] doing this if he doesn't dwell on you
[8:54] you were not gonna be doing this to the
[8:57] world that sounds nasty to a believer
[9:00] it's rich amen verse 57 as as the living
[9:06] father hath sent me and I live by the
[9:08] father so he that eateth me even he
[9:11] shall live by me last verse this is that
[9:14] bread which came down from heaven not as
[9:16] your father's did eat manna and our dead
[9:19] he that eateth of this bread shall live
[9:22] forever praise the Lord you may be
[9:24] seated this evening Amen Lord blood a
[9:26] blessing to his word we thank God amen
[9:32] because the Bible says that every word
[9:35] of God is is is a is for us to receive
[9:39] reproof to receive - to grow in him we
[9:42] need every part of the word
[9:44] so sometimes we like well why is that
[9:47] there maybe that's not important it's
[9:49] there for a reason they meant every part
[9:51] of it even to the point where Jesus said
[9:54] on a donkey Amen that went through
[9:57] Jerusalem one that I heard a brother
[9:58] just recently speak about that the
[10:00] predestinated donkey and there was a
[10:03] purpose
[10:04] for that donkey in it and it's in the
[10:06] Bible so it's there for a reason amen
[10:08] praise God so we're gonna look at this
[10:10] and it's here for a reason they men
[10:12] praise God
[10:13] so we I want to title this message
[10:15] tonight you are what you eat you are
[10:18] what you eat and I'm not gonna get into
[10:19] anybody's gastronomical the you know
[10:23] preferences that's not what I'm gonna
[10:24] talk about you know I'm not gonna talk
[10:26] about diets or anything like that but uh
[10:28] but what I am gonna speak about is that
[10:32] the physical the natural types of
[10:34] spiritual amen and Jesus here is telling
[10:39] us something
[10:40] amen about eating and drinking because
[10:43] you know we all need to eat right in
[10:46] life that's the way we grow ourselves
[10:49] need oh we have sales are our nails are
[10:53] made up of our fingers are made up of
[10:55] cells our hair is made up of cells our
[10:57] body every body part that you have is
[11:00] made up of cells and those cells are
[11:02] therefore for a particular for a
[11:05] specific time for time and so they need
[11:09] nourishment in order to give you back
[11:11] what you need you see so usually when
[11:15] you're eating right and when you're when
[11:17] you're feeding yourself with wholesome
[11:19] foods amen your your body's gonna show
[11:22] it on the outside and particularly start
[11:25] showing it on the skin that's the organ
[11:27] that it first starts showing it and so
[11:29] when you see somebody I don't know if
[11:31] you ever seen somebody with like I just
[11:32] have like this glowing skin and like
[11:34] their nails just just seems so perfect
[11:37] and their hair just so shiny it may be
[11:39] what they are putting inside their body
[11:41] amen because they're because when you
[11:44] feed your body the said the right things
[11:48] your cells are being fed the proper
[11:50] things they're gonna pay you back with
[11:52] with with good health and life and
[11:55] strength you see a mess so if it's like
[11:58] that in the natural I mean how much more
[12:00] in the spiritual Saints that if your are
[12:03] feeding on the junk food of the world if
[12:06] you're feeding on the junk music of the
[12:09] world if you are feeding on the on the
[12:11] on the things of the world that are not
[12:14] helping you to grow in this stature of a
[12:17] figman amen you're dying spiritually
[12:22] you're dying spiritually amen so you
[12:27] know we we uh when we get together with
[12:29] my family down in South Carolina when we
[12:35] get together we or when we usually get
[12:37] together here we usually gather around
[12:38] food right that's well that's what we
[12:41] gather we gather around there's there's
[12:43] always a potluck there's always some of
[12:44] you know food when we have fellowship
[12:46] dinners afterwards what do we have we
[12:48] have food downstairs food is something
[12:50] that unites us you see it we have a
[12:52] bonding with food you may not speak one
[12:55] person's language you know they may
[12:57] speak Chinese you speak English but when
[13:00] you're eating the plate of noodles or
[13:01] whatever Amen that's bonding you you see
[13:04] and you might not be able to talk to him
[13:07] but that food is bonding you why it's a
[13:09] form of communication and it's also a
[13:10] form of enjoyment for us you see food
[13:13] originally when we were created it was
[13:15] just for enjoyment it wasn't for us to
[13:19] live we didn't need to eat food for us
[13:21] to live
[13:22] but when sim came in the picture that's
[13:25] the reason why we need to eat in order
[13:27] for us to live amen but one day that's
[13:29] all going back amen
[13:31] we have that hope with a one that you
[13:33] don't have to eat in order for you to
[13:37] live amen if you got eternal life you
[13:40] got eternal life amen
[13:41] praise God so you don't have to eat a
[13:43] man yeah it'll just be all for enjoyment
[13:47] I heard somebody say one day one time
[13:49] that when they get together with their
[13:51] family their family is like this like a
[13:53] Snickers bar they're sweet on the
[13:56] outside with a bunch of nuts on the
[13:58] inside anybody like that oh there's
[14:05] people raising their hands so I guess
[14:06] they're you're funny
[14:11] yeah so they're you know our families
[14:14] they can be very sweet on the outside
[14:16] just like a Snickers bar but very nutty
[14:18] on the inside amen so that's maybe they
[14:23] might say that about me
[14:24] they might say that about my mind my
[14:26] brain
[14:27] maybe a little sweet on the outside
[14:29] maybe but nutty on the inside amen
[14:34] praise God but thank God for the nuts
[14:36] hey man
[14:37] praise God so let me read here the just
[14:42] a quick thing here about the purpose of
[14:44] eating eating also known as consuming is
[14:46] the ingestion of food typically to
[14:48] provide a heterotrophic organisms with
[14:51] energy and to allow for growth all right
[14:53] the phrase you are what you eat is
[14:56] literally true nutrients from the food
[14:59] you eat food provide the foundation of
[15:02] the structure function and integrity of
[15:04] every little cell in your body from your
[15:07] skin and hair to your muscles bones
[15:09] digestive and immune systems you may not
[15:12] feel it but you're constantly repairing
[15:15] healing and rebuilding your body so when
[15:19] you when you take that that McDonald's
[15:22] hamburger and you consume it you eat it
[15:26] or that chick-fil-a chicken sandwich
[15:28] with American cheese on it the way I
[15:29] like yeah this waffle fries right as
[15:37] soon as that hits your belly you don't
[15:40] feel like you know that you're full
[15:42] right for some of us some of us may need
[15:44] to two maybe two portions but you may
[15:50] not feel you may feel that you're full
[15:52] but you there's a lot of things that are
[15:54] going on inside that you have no idea
[15:57] that's going on that's trying to extract
[16:01] the nutrients a a man from that food
[16:03] praise God in order for that you can
[16:05] live tomorrow the day after or a couple
[16:08] of days after right and it's the same
[16:10] thing when we come to the house of God
[16:12] amen when you when you have brother wait
[16:14] up here preaching or a minister of
[16:16] preaching brother Dale's preaching
[16:18] anybody up here ministering the word
[16:19] amen
[16:20] and you're feeding you may not feel like
[16:23] nothing is going on you may not feel you
[16:26] may come out here and you may like I
[16:28] didn't feel anything right how do you
[16:31] only feel anything but let me tell you
[16:33] if you love the Lord and you went to
[16:34] that service with our heart attitude
[16:36] Lord I'm ready to receive what you
[16:38] haven't stored from me because what you
[16:39] cooked through a brother wait what you
[16:42] cooked up through brother Dale what you
[16:43] cooked up through any minister that
[16:45] comes here
[16:45] that's preaching the Word of God amen
[16:47] you're gonna leave out of here and
[16:49] that's gonna manifest sometime later on
[16:51] in the future
[16:52] amen you're gonna mean that you may not
[16:55] feel nothing right now but let me tell
[16:57] you it's gonna manifest again sometime
[16:59] if you continue with we're walking in
[17:02] the in his word amen
[17:03] praise God sometimes we may come to
[17:06] ho-hum services that's all right as
[17:08] though if the word is going forth Amen
[17:11] and you're in and usually you say Lord
[17:13] I'm eating whatever they give me even if
[17:16] it's crumbs and we'll talk about that in
[17:18] just a little bit if it's crumbs those
[17:20] crumbs have enough power to for me to
[17:22] receive anything that I have need of
[17:24] amen even if it's little crumbs and I
[17:26] may not understand everything that
[17:28] brother Dale brought out but if I just
[17:30] grab one little thing that one little
[17:32] thing can sustain me for the rest of the
[17:34] week now if you come with an attitude of
[17:36] like oh that's another church service
[17:38] I'm bored and I can't wait to go home so
[17:43] I can get on snapchat you're not gonna
[17:47] get anything out of the service
[17:48] you're dying spiritually all right so I
[17:54] I may say I may say some things that
[17:56] that may come down to our homes but
[18:01] that's alright we need it
[18:02] praise God amen so so what we put in our
[18:08] bodies physically reflects on the
[18:10] outside how much more it is on the
[18:12] spiritual you see now proverbs 23:7
[18:15] tells us for as he thinketh in his heart
[18:19] so is he
[18:20] and we know Salomon today he's talking
[18:22] about demand for as a man thinketh in
[18:25] his heart so is he
[18:26] and and the Jesus said out of the
[18:32] abundance of the heart speaketh the
[18:34] mouth you see the heart your spirit man
[18:37] right your conscious reason and
[18:40] affection and then the other two that I
[18:42] always forget the way you say it all the
[18:44] time memory and reasoning
[18:48] and my wife knows that I needed help
[18:50] with that that spirit man there's
[18:57] they're the inlets Amen that you have
[19:00] amen
[19:01] your your your listening your eyes amen
[19:06] they they bring in that that information
[19:09] or that that stuff that you bring in
[19:11] amen and and if you're constantly
[19:14] pondering on those things if you're
[19:16] constantly pampering to those things
[19:20] amen
[19:21] then out of the abundance of the heart
[19:23] the mouth will speak you see you can you
[19:29] cannot you necessarily you don't you you
[19:32] you may not be able to tell what it is
[19:34] that a person is feeding on by by the
[19:37] way they look sometimes you can
[19:41] sometimes you can't because a person
[19:44] could look a certain way
[19:46] a sister could have long hair and and
[19:50] they could just wear the longest dresses
[19:52] and and just look like the holiest woman
[19:56] in the world but then they'd be feeding
[19:59] off junk food at home and they may not
[20:05] manifest on the outside but eventually
[20:07] that will manifest somehow and usually
[20:10] it will manifest by the way the person
[20:11] talks you look at you listen to a person
[20:15] speak you listen to a person talk and
[20:17] that usually manifests what it is that
[20:20] they're feeding off of you see so person
[20:24] may not necessarily shown it on the
[20:25] outside but then they're feeding off
[20:27] something else differently they're here
[20:29] at church they're listening to the word
[20:31] they go through the motions
[20:32] they might raise their hand they might
[20:36] they might agree with the word but then
[20:38] when they go home and leave these doors
[20:40] they men they're feeding off something
[20:41] else amen
[20:42] the Bible tells me that's hip oh that's
[20:44] a paper crib that's what the Bible says
[20:48] right that's a hypocrite and so we want
[20:54] to make sure that because out of the
[20:56] abundance of the heart speaks the mouth
[20:58] so whatever it is that your feet letting
[21:01] in through these
[21:01] inlets your ears your eyes whatever
[21:05] you're watching you're probably maybe
[21:07] you maybe you're just now they say you
[21:10] know with all these movie services that
[21:12] they have now called binge watching
[21:15] Netflix YouTube Hulu all these different
[21:20] movie services that you can sit all day
[21:23] long with your feet propped and watch
[21:25] movies all day long binge watching right
[21:29] feeding feeding your carnal man amen
[21:32] constantly and eventually out of the
[21:36] abundance of what you're feeding off
[21:37] that's gonna show off sure show out of
[21:39] you so at some point in town same thing
[21:41] with the music that you listen to a man
[21:44] if you're constantly listening to
[21:45] hip-hop and rap you constantly listen to
[21:48] rock and roll if you're listening to you
[21:51] know Shawn Mendes and and Shakira and
[21:57] Justin Timberlake and and and all these
[21:59] all these you know some of you are
[22:02] smiling cuz you know what I'm talking
[22:03] about
[22:03] [Laughter]
[22:05] if you're constantly feeding off these
[22:07] things you're gonna eventually show off
[22:11] show this off in some way or another is
[22:14] those things helping you grow in Christ
[22:17] is it helping you say you want to be in
[22:20] the stature of a perfect man but you
[22:22] can't be in the stature a perfect man if
[22:23] you're listening to Shawn Mendes if
[22:26] you're watching if you're watching
[22:27] r-rated movies and horror movies all the
[22:30] time you will never grow in the stature
[22:33] of a perfect man that way you see praise
[22:35] God
[22:35] a man so look what Jesus says here let's
[22:38] read here and if the brothers want to
[22:39] bring it up in Matthew chapter 15
[22:47] Matthew chapter 15 verse 18 says but
[22:50] those things which proceed out of the
[22:52] mouth come forth from the heart and
[22:54] those are the things they defiled a man
[22:56] for out of the heart proceed evil
[22:59] thoughts how many have had an evil
[23:02] thoughts in the past I've had evil
[23:05] thoughts all right
[23:07] murders adulteries I hope nobody hears
[23:09] murdering anybody adulteries
[23:11] fornications thefts false witness
[23:13] blasphemies
[23:15] these are the things which the follow
[23:18] man you see these are the things and
[23:23] because you have let these things come
[23:24] in into your spirit amen
[23:27] as they're going forth there they're
[23:29] defiling you amen and not only that but
[23:32] you're also you may be the following
[23:33] somebody else to you see your testimony
[23:37] is very important praise God
[23:39] so and of course in Luke chapter 6 verse
[23:43] 45 Jesus says a good man out of the good
[23:46] treasure of his heart bringeth forth
[23:49] that which is good that's why Jesus said
[23:53] that lay your treasures up in heaven
[23:56] do not let your treasures here on earth
[23:58] if you're laying treasures here on earth
[24:01] if you're laying if you're if you're if
[24:03] you're if you're totally so satisfied
[24:08] with this life here on earth
[24:10] something's wrong with you spiritual if
[24:13] you're not looking for the coming of the
[24:15] Lord if you're not desiring like John
[24:18] said in the in the Isle of Patmos so
[24:20] come Lord Jesus come quickly if that's
[24:23] not your desire you need to repent and
[24:25] you need to be born again amen I need to
[24:29] be born again if that's not my desire
[24:31] amen because that's that's what a true
[24:36] Christian that's what He desires he
[24:38] doesn't want to continue in his in his
[24:40] video gaming and his and his thing just
[24:43] Lord let me finish this game of a Grand
[24:46] Theft Auto before you come Lord I need
[24:48] to make sure to see really what the end
[24:49] of this game is you know before you come
[24:51] now
[24:53] Lord I want to make sure that I listen
[24:56] to all of Adele's albums you know before
[24:58] you come Lord I want to make sure that I
[25:00] did I something's wrong with you then
[25:02] Lord I want to make sure that I watch
[25:04] all the the series of such-and-such such
[25:07] a movie before you come something's
[25:09] wrong with you amen
[25:12] even if you want even as you young
[25:14] people you should be so in love with God
[25:17] and I know this is hard because I went
[25:21] through it but you should be so in love
[25:23] with the Lord Jesus Christ that you
[25:25] should say Lord even if I don't get
[25:27] married
[25:28] I still want you to come Lord even if I
[25:33] don't experience marriage and and being
[25:37] with with with a mate experiencing that
[25:39] you know I still prefer that you come
[25:42] Lord come Lord quickly because that's
[25:44] much better if you can say that truly
[25:47] from the from your heart a man there's
[25:48] something God's done something in your
[25:50] life amen
[25:52] God's now God's done something in your
[25:54] life amen because let me tell you Saints
[25:58] those things go and pass and come and go
[26:01] you see they come and go things things
[26:07] that that we do in this life that this
[26:10] world Hollywood provides to us and
[26:12] they're just here for a temporal a
[26:15] temple you know when I first come to the
[26:18] Lord
[26:19] I had my struggle as I've always told
[26:22] you one of my things I loved hip-hop and
[26:24] rap right and so I was I struggled
[26:27] through through my Christian life you
[26:29] know with that music I would be I could
[26:34] be at a restaurant eating and they have
[26:37] some sort of 90s of the station playing
[26:41] and all of a sudden some of that hip-hop
[26:43] music that I used to listen to or be a
[26:45] song that it that baseline starts with
[26:47] you know I'm like oh man I remember
[26:50] where I was where I first heard heard
[26:52] that I was with a girl in the car and
[26:56] you know it wasn't anything good she was
[26:59] playing it she had a big tent of 15-inch
[27:01] speakers in the back and and then it's
[27:04] and you get anointed and you're like
[27:07] what and I can't believe I still
[27:08] remember the words of that song that's
[27:11] how much effect music has in your mind
[27:15] and you don't realize it so if the world
[27:19] affects us so much like that how much
[27:22] more the things of God the music of God
[27:24] amen if you just let the music of God
[27:26] take ahold of you in that way
[27:29] amen and the only way you could curve
[27:32] that appetite or change that is you know
[27:36] change your appetite you see I had to
[27:39] completely just just
[27:41] the devil and he will flee sometimes we
[27:45] just have to do that resist him and he
[27:48] will flee with our flesh brother Brown
[27:50] said our flesh is gonna be sticky it's
[27:53] gonna be sticky until the day we die
[27:55] until it until we get that you know
[27:57] about a body change right it's gonna be
[28:00] sticky but God has given us a way to
[28:03] overcome amen
[28:05] and so if you're constantly feeding on
[28:07] the word if you're constantly desiring
[28:09] the things of God and being around the
[28:12] things that will help you to grow into
[28:13] that stature they meant the more of the
[28:16] world starts dying off the more of the
[28:18] world starts falling off more baggage
[28:20] starts coming off you see oh my I can't
[28:24] believe I don't even I don't even desire
[28:26] that anymore I can be around it and it's
[28:29] like doesn't bother me anymore I had a
[28:32] friend a friend in Anderson you know who
[28:35] he's a brother in the Lord and he said
[28:40] the Lord's changed him so much because
[28:42] he used to have an issue with with
[28:44] looking at women that he the Lord
[28:49] changed him so much that it's like when
[28:50] he's walking with his wife it's like the
[28:52] Lord put some light blinders on it on
[28:54] the Sun he has no clue that there's
[28:56] half-naked women walking right by him
[28:59] his wife would ask him did you see that
[29:02] woman that no hopefully he's not lying
[29:06] but I believe what he was saying that
[29:09] the Lord changed him that much I mean
[29:11] that's when the Lord Amen has really
[29:12] done a work in your life Amen that you
[29:15] can truly say Lord I have no desire for
[29:18] those things in my heart there are some
[29:20] things that there's some things there
[29:21] okay I'm not saying it's bad to play
[29:24] video games and I'm not saying it's bad
[29:26] to engaged in some things or watch a
[29:28] movie every now and that depends on what
[29:30] you're watching right it's not feeding
[29:32] your soul you're not growing in that
[29:33] statue right but but if that's what you
[29:38] desire over the Word of God over the
[29:40] things of God over church over over what
[29:42] over paint being with your brothers and
[29:45] sisters then that's that's a problem
[29:48] amen that's a problem that's a spiritual
[29:50] issue that God amen has to help you with
[29:53] amen
[29:54] praise God so sometimes we can be so
[29:59] desensitized they men cut with
[30:01] constantly playing video games and call
[30:04] of duty 2 K 18 fortnight oh look at that
[30:13] there's some of these older ones don't
[30:16] know what I'm thought but some of these
[30:18] younger ones know what I'm talking about
[30:20] [Laughter]
[30:22] Grand Theft Auto like I mentioned here
[30:24] all ago and I know some of us probably
[30:27] have those games in our house right now
[30:34] if you knew what happened in Grand Theft
[30:37] Auto some of the older ones knew what
[30:39] was you'd be like I can't believe it
[30:41] it's a terrible game
[30:43] it really is constantly listen to on
[30:48] godly music you know I mentioned Nicki
[30:50] Minaj Demi Lovato Bruno Mars somebody
[30:56] said I look like him a little bit is
[30:58] that true
[31:01] [Laughter]
[31:03] amen and you're constantly on snapchat
[31:06] Instagram Twitter or Facebook instead of
[31:10] your face being in this book amen
[31:14] that's what you feed off of
[31:29] posting posting pictures like that that
[31:37] out of the abundance of the heart speak
[31:40] at the mouth
[31:41] not just the mouth but your body actions
[31:44] and your and your actions show forth
[31:46] what you're really wrought you really
[31:48] feed off of amen
[31:52] so then trying to move on here
[31:55] amen I hope you're enjoying this amen
[31:57] praise God sometimes you know we treat
[32:00] God like a light like a convenient
[32:02] pop-tart you know look at this I got
[32:08] pop-tarts right here how many know what
[32:14] this is look at this
[32:17] strawberry has even got a little cartoon
[32:21] comic-book character or something on it
[32:23] it must be good it must be delicious and
[32:27] nutritious but sometimes you know we've
[32:35] stayed up all night playing Grand Theft
[32:36] Auto and and and listening to Bruno Mars
[32:40] trying to make sure I get the listen all
[32:42] the and this is how we treat God in the
[32:44] mornings
[32:53] oh wait a second I could put the second
[33:00] one in the toaster I have I have a
[33:02] minute I'll put these out there outside
[33:07] anybody could take them afterwards but
[33:11] sometimes this is how we treat got it
[33:13] like a pop-tart you know like in the
[33:16] mornings when you're supposed to make
[33:19] time for God before you actually start
[33:22] your day right make time for him because
[33:27] he won't bless you if you don't give him
[33:28] the time that he needs right if you make
[33:31] time for him you'll make sure that
[33:32] you'll need you did that feel that you
[33:35] need any men you don't have to wait all
[33:36] the way till Wednesday or Sunday a man
[33:39] you have that personal time with him and
[33:40] you don't have to treat God like a
[33:42] poptart
[33:43] sure this thing is gonna you know the
[33:46] sugar from it is gonna feed you for
[33:48] about an hour or hour and a half maybe
[33:50] but it's certainly not gonna gonna fuel
[33:54] you for for for up until lunchtime these
[33:57] things are meant to do some bad things
[34:00] to you just letting you know I don't
[34:03] know how they could say this is
[34:04] breakfast to me this is a snack I grew
[34:15] up with bacon and eggs and those types
[34:17] of things that's how I grew up with you
[34:19] know those are the things that nourish
[34:20] you
[34:21] it takes time in the morning to get up
[34:23] make some toast bacon and eggs and and
[34:25] things like that that takes time right
[34:27] but you feel so good after you eat that
[34:29] right and wash it down with a nice cup
[34:31] of coffee right but that right there
[34:34] even though you get it quick you know
[34:36] just like a drop through you know you
[34:39] think even though it says on the outside
[34:41] fresh right from the grill you think
[34:44] that's just as fresh as it is if he
[34:45] cooked it at your house I don't think so
[34:48] but that's just exactly how we treat God
[34:50] like we're going through a drive-through
[34:52] let me just grab something real quick
[34:53] and a quick little sermon a quick little
[34:57] five-minute prayer or a quick little
[34:59] devotional you know and then I'll just
[35:01] go move along the way I'll get back to
[35:03] my Grand Theft Auto can't wait
[35:08] Saints I'm challenging you I'm
[35:11] challenging you that because we're
[35:14] living in a late hour things are upon us
[35:17] that we are we are we're skint we're so
[35:20] comfortable with this life
[35:22] we're so comfortably I have to check
[35:24] myself too you know sometimes I get so
[35:28] carried away with with things like that
[35:30] that I realized wait a second what am I
[35:33] getting out of those things is drawing
[35:35] me away from the Word of God my desire
[35:38] for the word is is leaving because I'm
[35:40] excited with basketball or or whatever
[35:44] those things are okay but if you put
[35:46] that in the place of God you're not
[35:48] gonna get anywhere with God amen praise
[35:52] God
[35:53] so amen you got to take time to take
[35:59] time to pray and feed on the word every
[36:01] day every day it's very important that
[36:04] you take time young people listen to me
[36:08] those that you can read you can listen
[36:11] take advantage that you that you're not
[36:14] deaf dumb and blind God's gonna ask you
[36:18] one day if you had the opportunity you
[36:22] have all these resources cover magazines
[36:26] that are being sent from voice of God
[36:29] these messages these sermons are
[36:31] uploaded to YouTube and all these three
[36:34] sources even other others other things
[36:37] out there Bibles you have a phone you
[36:40] can have 30 Bibles on your phone now you
[36:43] have you and I have no excuse in this
[36:46] day God's gonna require those things
[36:48] from us God's gonna require those things
[36:51] from us amen
[36:53] I hope we don't we're not laying him
[36:56] down and treating him like a pop-tart
[36:58] amen praise God brother the brothers in
[37:00] the back if they could show picture
[37:01] number one hope they got the pictures
[37:10] all right
[37:12] we're gonna look at some foods here this
[37:18] right here is called escargot it's a
[37:22] French food and it snails stuffed with
[37:27] something I think I've had those I've
[37:31] had about you eaten those Christine I
[37:32] can't remember if I have or not but I
[37:34] would love to try them because I have a
[37:36] French brother-in-law and he just tells
[37:39] me they're great so I'm looking forward
[37:41] to him next picture this right here is
[37:51] called papa eatin this is this is a dish
[37:54] in the northern Philippines that's that
[37:57] I had the privilege of eating it's made
[38:02] of the intros of a goat or a cow and
[38:06] then inside the soup what they do
[38:10] because it's called bitter soup and what
[38:12] did they do is they take the bile the
[38:14] bile of the of that animal and squeeze
[38:17] it in the soup so you're eating a bitter
[38:20] soup and if you know what bowel is it
[38:22] helps digest your food and things like
[38:24] break down fats and stuff and it's
[38:26] usually bitter and so that's what this
[38:28] soup is made out of and it's a delicate
[38:30] let me tell you it's an acquired taste
[38:32] when I went to the Philippines the first
[38:34] time and I went brother royal Soriano
[38:36] took me to the north and he told me and
[38:39] they said the brothers are making papaya
[38:41] eaten it's very it's very tasty and and
[38:44] he can't explain to me what it was I'm
[38:45] like I'm the type of person that I'm
[38:47] willing to try something at least once
[38:48] so they served it to me and they make
[38:51] sure they put a lot of lemons right
[38:53] right there because and when I put put
[38:56] that first taste in my mouth
[38:57] I started squirting lemons inside that
[38:59] thing because that's the only thing
[39:01] that'll sort of take that bitter taste
[39:03] out of the soup at least some of some
[39:06] what I was done eating the soup and then
[39:09] they had bananas right there next to the
[39:11] table I made sure I started grinding
[39:13] needs and bananas trying to get that
[39:14] taste out of my mouth brother comes in
[39:17] and says brother do you like the soup it
[39:20] looks like you did you ate it all you
[39:21] want some more and it was hard for me to
[39:23] tell them no
[39:25] how do you want to let him down you know
[39:27] I want him to kept thinking that I did
[39:29] like it
[39:30] so he served me a second plate and I had
[39:33] to eat it you know I just felt bad you
[39:37] know we're so privileged here in America
[39:40] and then they they cook these things and
[39:42] that's how I felt about it so then the
[39:45] next day brother Soriano he had to
[39:47] preach or he had to be at a wedding
[39:49] preacher wedding and the brothers that I
[39:51] was that had cooked that food that dish
[39:53] I went to a hotel with him and they and
[39:58] then there was time to eat and they had
[40:01] they had put this soup inside plastic
[40:04] bags so guess what
[40:07] that's what we had to again I had three
[40:11] servings of that stuff so I know what
[40:14] that's like
[40:16] brotherbrother royale tells the story
[40:18] one time that he ate this soup one time
[40:20] at a certain region in the Philippines
[40:22] it was so fresh it was the entrance of a
[40:26] goat and the insides of a goat that when
[40:28] he was eating the soup there was little
[40:30] grass blades ins there the goat eats
[40:33] grass all right next real quick I'm
[40:37] gonna go quick now okay I'm gonna go
[40:39] quick now this here is Baloo by the way
[40:43] it he knows what it is
[40:45] this is another Filipino delicacy it's
[40:47] it's a I've had Baloo as well not not
[40:54] that not that duck fully firmed form
[40:56] that way but it's an embryo stage it
[40:59] tastes just like a boiled egg but this
[41:01] is this is food to them right this is
[41:04] this is food to them next they say it
[41:07] gives them a lot of protein and this
[41:10] right here is cooked rats they eat this
[41:13] and this is very delicacy in China and
[41:16] in Asia and other other other Asian
[41:19] countries
[41:23] then he said all right you get or Danny
[41:28] said in Waffle House - all right you can
[41:32] turn it off now for now you had to say
[41:39] something
[41:40] all right but here's the point here's
[41:44] the point
[41:44] you thought that those things were gross
[41:46] right brother Rick gave us a minute - a
[41:52] lot of people those things are food
[41:55] that's Street some of that is street
[41:57] food and it's good just like you know a
[41:59] Polish sausage is sold in the streets
[42:01] and then to you that's good right well
[42:05] let me ask you this what do you think
[42:06] God would think of what you feed off of
[42:10] if God was seeing what you feed off of
[42:13] in slides just like this would he be
[42:16] worried or would he be like yeah that's
[42:25] just like me what would he what would he
[42:29] say what would he say about what you
[42:33] feed off of good question right
[42:37] something to think about
[42:40] amen and sometimes we can take things
[42:44] amen because for example there's
[42:48] combinations that you can have for
[42:50] example you can have you can eat peanut
[42:52] butter and and butter and jelly it
[42:55] tastes good right you're gonna have beef
[42:58] stew in this I was thinking rice you
[43:03] know you've stewing rice alright what's
[43:07] the other bacon and eggs right those
[43:10] combinations are great right those are
[43:13] good combinations I like those things
[43:15] too right and and you know sometimes uh
[43:22] you know how many like - how many like
[43:24] tea this is gold peak tea all right
[43:30] peach flavor
[43:32] and I like tea right I love I like tea I
[43:37] like lemonade I like those things and
[43:41] I'm gonna give this brother weight
[43:43] afterwards he he said he might want it
[43:45] after all right I had permission from
[43:48] today to do this so I'm not out of order
[43:52] I hope not but I also like frappuccinos
[43:58] do you like frappuccinos I like frappe
[44:02] like coffee yes
[44:06] Starbucks I know I like frappuccinos
[44:09] right
[44:10] but I also like tea all right and I also
[44:20] like frappuccinos right so sometimes you
[44:27] know we're feeding off of the things of
[44:31] God as you say this is this seems a bit
[44:34] more natural you know sometimes we feed
[44:36] off the things of God and it's good oh I
[44:40] love reading the Bible but I also like
[44:43] listening to Bruno Mars oh I love going
[44:47] to youth camps but I also like going the
[44:50] club and watching going to the movie
[44:53] theater watching who knows what oh I
[44:56] love listening to gospel music but I
[44:59] also love listening to this type of
[45:01] music in my life you see that doesn't
[45:05] balance out right because that's to God
[45:09] you know that's like if you were doing
[45:10] something like this
[45:20] this is pretty nasty right I did it
[45:30] still tastes like tea
[45:36] that's disgusting now it looks
[45:38] disgusting right
[45:39] but this is what we do sometimes with
[45:41] our spiritual life this is exactly what
[45:44] we do with our spiritual life we feed
[45:47] off the world we listen to Christian
[45:49] rock Christian hip-hop Christian rap
[45:55] what's her Christian about it if the
[45:58] world was the one that invented it how
[46:00] can it be Christian eyes the other day I
[46:03] was I was actually looking at Christian
[46:05] either they have Christian nightclubs
[46:08] now and so I went to their Facebook page
[46:12] just to see what then they have some
[46:13] videos there and I clicked on one I
[46:18] couldn't tell the difference from a
[46:20] regular nightclub and so you see
[46:22] anything that just because it's called
[46:24] Christian doesn't mean it's good for you
[46:26] right just because it has the label
[46:28] Christian on it does not mean that it's
[46:32] healthy for you to continue to grow in
[46:34] the stature of a perfect man right and
[46:36] you cannot mix the world with God jesus
[46:39] said jesus said you cannot get sweet and
[46:42] bitter water from the same fountain you
[46:46] either get sweet water you get bitter
[46:47] water there is no such thing as a drunk
[46:50] sober man he's either drunk or you're
[46:53] sober right and there's no such thing as
[46:59] feeding on the things of God with all
[47:02] your heart and then when you get home
[47:05] feeding on the things of the world with
[47:07] all your heart you have to love one or
[47:09] the other you have to bend one for the
[47:12] other and we're living in a late hour
[47:14] and I hope that you're bending for the
[47:16] things of God Saints somebody's welcome
[47:20] to these afterwards praise God
[47:25] amen he's God I love my mom and dad
[47:32] but I love to talk back in this respect
[47:34] them at the same time do you do that I
[47:39] love people at church but I love to act
[47:43] like I'm better than them around them I
[47:46] come to them you know III say I say hey
[47:51] hey brother
[47:51] god bless you and I'm not even looked up
[47:54] at you no that's disrespect I was taught
[48:02] different as a young person you know you
[48:05] when an adult shakes your hand or it
[48:06] says hello you look at them in the eye
[48:08] and say hey hello god bless your heart
[48:13] hey man I love youth camps but I also
[48:17] love the movie theater and I also love
[48:19] these things you know
[48:20] and speaking of youth camp Saints you
[48:22] know III really I want I want to be able
[48:28] to have my children somewhere where they
[48:29] can grow in the Lord you see you know
[48:33] Minh so you consider a man because I've
[48:38] been I've been I've been places where
[48:40] we're kids were not neglected that
[48:42] didn't seem like it was an important
[48:44] thing in a children child's life and I
[48:47] could guarantee you the majority of
[48:48] those kids are serving the not serving
[48:51] the Lord because they wasn't important
[48:54] for the parent whatever is important for
[48:57] you as a parent your children picks up
[48:59] on that and realizes wait this is
[49:01] important this is not important this is
[49:04] this is this is priority in my life this
[49:06] is not priority my mommy and daddy are
[49:08] not engaged in this I guess I'm not
[49:09] gonna get and then you wonder why your
[49:11] kids are not serving the Lord
[49:14] you wonder why but at least I'm not
[49:19] gonna I'm not saying that a youth camp
[49:20] promises that your kid will get the Holy
[49:22] Ghost and and and and they will serve
[49:24] God forever that's not the case if it
[49:27] happens great
[49:28] it can happen I'd rather have them at a
[49:33] youth camp you know there's more higher
[49:35] percentage that they're gonna grow in
[49:37] the Lord at a youth camp and get the
[49:38] Holy Ghost of the youth camp they're at
[49:40] a movie theater watching who knows what
[49:45] watching a Disney movie right so so you
[49:52] know it's very important what because
[49:54] your kids will pick up on what you're
[49:56] feeding off of as a parent amen
[49:58] praise God amen
[50:01] so moving on here so sometimes we're
[50:05] like we're like oh but I'm watching this
[50:07] movie and there's a bunch of cursing in
[50:10] it but there is some good stuff in it
[50:12] you know I'm listening to this music
[50:14] there's some cursing and some some nasty
[50:17] things that they're talking about in the
[50:18] song but there's they mentioned the word
[50:20] Jesus twice in there and they say God
[50:25] they're probably saying it in vain you
[50:30] know so it must be okay you know to me
[50:33] that kind of reminds me like if you're
[50:35] digging in a trash can looking for cuz
[50:39] you're very hungry right you're digging
[50:41] in a trash bin and you find a piece of
[50:43] biscuit you like hole mine but you have
[50:47] to go through all that trash just to
[50:49] find the little bit that was good and
[50:53] then when you get to that little bit
[50:55] that's good
[50:56] it's all probably all stale and moldy
[50:57] but at the end so nothing that has the
[51:00] name of Christian it's not good for that
[51:03] don't the the world wants to make you
[51:05] believe Satan wants to make you believe
[51:07] that it is but it's not healthy and
[51:09] wholesome for you to grow in the stature
[51:12] of a perfect man right because that's
[51:15] what we want to grow right
[51:17] amen amen Eagles they trying to move a
[51:20] little quicker now Eagles in Psalms 103
[51:22] look what Psalms 103 says if the
[51:25] brothers bring it up
[51:26] he says bless the Lord O my soul and all
[51:33] that is within me bless His Holy Name
[51:35] right bless the Lord O my soul and
[51:37] forget not all his benefits so there's
[51:40] benefits that come with serving God this
[51:45] was in the Old Testament but no
[51:48] forgetting all his benefits who
[51:50] forgiveth all thine iniquities an
[51:54] iniquity is doing something that you're
[51:57] not supposed to do that you know that
[51:58] you're not supposed to
[51:59] and you do or not doing something that
[52:01] you know you're supposed to do and you
[52:02] still do it right
[52:04] that's iniquity who forgives all of your
[52:08] iniquities or the mighty God we serve
[52:12] who heals all by diseases the Shawn
[52:16] Mendes do that for you
[52:18] does Bruno Mars do that for you just
[52:22] playing Grand Theft Auto do that for you
[52:24] I don't think so
[52:26] who redeemeth thy life from destruction
[52:30] look at that you you're able to be kept
[52:33] from destruction
[52:34] the destruction that this world is
[52:37] heading to right now at this very moment
[52:38] and then they'll not even know it you
[52:41] are kept you can be kept from that amen
[52:43] its physical destruction spiritual
[52:45] destruction both ways who crown ethey
[52:48] with loving-kindness and tender mercies
[52:51] so thankful for to God for His mercy
[52:53] amen and look what verse 5 says who
[52:57] satisfies thy mouth with good things
[53:00] alright alright this this was not good
[53:05] but God has something good for you
[53:08] amen wholesome things and look at this
[53:11] so that thy youth is renewed like the
[53:13] Eagles praise God this is not just for
[53:17] the young people this is for us adults
[53:18] as well yeah where you were young and in
[53:22] Soul Amen praise God
[53:24] so because why an eagle does not eat
[53:28] rotten things an eagle when he kills and
[53:32] he's about to eat he kills he eats it
[53:35] and make sure it is eaten right away
[53:36] right he does not wait around that it's
[53:39] been dead with day two or three days
[53:41] like a crow or a buzzard or something
[53:44] that still you know you see them then
[53:45] they're just munching away all gathering
[53:47] around you know
[53:48] yeah and that's how it is with the world
[53:50] you know you see over there were leap
[53:52] worldly people when they gather around
[53:53] something they're at a concert and it's
[53:56] like them they're eating something dead
[53:57] and you're and if you desire that you I
[54:01] wish I was there I wish I could could be
[54:03] hang out with those you know why they're
[54:08] eating it it's like it's just think of
[54:10] think of it that it's like a bunch of
[54:11] buzzards eating a bunch of
[54:12] things now you seen buzzards flying
[54:15] around eating something dead you know
[54:18] and buzzards I mean this is just gross
[54:23] looking here anyways you see so now I
[54:29] want to talk about this Saints for just
[54:31] a moment young people listen if you stay
[54:34] with God's process you will never go
[54:38] wrong amen
[54:39] and so if the brothers can bring up the
[54:42] the fifth pick I think he already showed
[54:45] it but I hope I hope this is helping
[54:51] somebody brother Wade says Amen does
[55:01] that look good that looks much better
[55:03] Zoe that looks better than the rats
[55:05] right yeah that looks better
[55:09] Zoe Zoe that looks better than the egg
[55:12] right yeah it looks much she says you
[55:18] don't care all right this looks much
[55:22] better now
[55:23] there's a process for you to eat this
[55:25] right the way I the way I would hear any
[55:28] normal person is because I mean if you
[55:31] eat it first you drink the drink then
[55:34] you eat the fries and then you eat the
[55:36] hamburger and that's usually not how
[55:38] people eat this meal maybe if you're
[55:42] five years old you might eat it like
[55:46] that oh wait a second all right normally
[55:55] the way you would eat this is you would
[55:57] maybe start it start this is how I
[56:00] started drink a little bit first kind of
[56:02] swish it in my mouth a little bit
[56:04] swallow and then I start with the main
[56:06] course the hamburger right and then as
[56:08] you put it should make just pretend this
[56:10] is the hamburger and then you take prior
[56:14] to dip it in the ketchup and you put it
[56:16] in your mouth right that's the normal
[56:19] way to eat and then you kind of wash it
[56:20] down with some of the coke right and
[56:23] it's good right it's good
[56:26] some of you are looking like you guys
[56:28] don't like this well just pretend it's a
[56:30] chick-fil-a sandwich all right but
[56:36] that's the normal way of doing things
[56:37] right but what if I took this and I
[56:41] don't I think there's another picture I
[56:44] don't know if there's another picture or
[56:46] not okay there's no nevermind
[56:50] but what if I took all of these things
[56:52] right here and I had a blender right
[56:54] here and I put all these things together
[56:57] blending them all together it's the same
[57:01] food but you've just blended it all
[57:06] together you completely destroyed the
[57:10] process of how that can you can ingest
[57:14] that it's totally nasty after that just
[57:17] think about it I watched I watch the gun
[57:18] on on YouTube do it do it and and it
[57:27] came out like a toxic sludge type thing
[57:29] and somebody went out and somebody the
[57:34] guy was doing and he said he said one
[57:35] day somebody said who we willing to
[57:38] drink this and he was at a youth rally
[57:40] and said they said so some kids started
[57:43] coming up rushing he's like my wait a
[57:44] second I can't give you this they were
[57:47] rushing generated wanted to drink that
[57:48] you know to be there to drink that
[57:50] but you end drink that right how much
[57:53] much you know how much more it is with
[57:58] with with what you're engaged in in your
[58:01] life you see sometimes as young people
[58:05] you know we we don't want to wait for
[58:09] the normal process of things let's just
[58:12] take marriage for example you want to
[58:15] rush things you don't want to wait you
[58:19] know to to start courting first or
[58:24] actually first make sure that that your
[58:27] parents are in there in agreement right
[58:29] look at the make sure the person has the
[58:32] holy spirit right and if you're about
[58:36] almost that Marable age if you're young
[58:39] that 25 you know I got married at 25 I
[58:42] better make sure I had a job if I was
[58:45] thinking about getting married I better
[58:48] make sure I was willing to support ready
[58:49] to support my wife because I wouldn't
[58:52] blame her she said no when I would ask
[58:54] her if you'd marry me I wouldn't blame
[58:58] her if she said no there's normal
[59:00] there's a process for you to take before
[59:03] you take a big step a man to finish up
[59:05] the whole meal right and and if you wait
[59:10] on God right because this you know
[59:15] marriage having that relationship with
[59:20] your wife that bonding with your husband
[59:22] or your wife in the future if God has
[59:24] you to be married that's all wonderful
[59:28] those are normal things even even in the
[59:31] sexual life those are all normal things
[59:33] that God put in place for us to
[59:36] procreate right if you eaten in the
[59:40] right process it's good it's delicious
[59:43] but when you rush and try to do your own
[59:46] thing and and and and and and mix it all
[59:48] up and and and and going out with
[59:51] multiple boyfriends and having multiple
[59:53] girlfriends and going with this one and
[59:56] that one is just the mix-up in life amen
[59:58] it's a toxic sludge so all of those
[1:00:01] though that that could have been good
[1:00:03] that's delicious that's that's wonderful
[1:00:05] that's healthy now it's just a bunch of
[1:00:08] toxic sludge because that's what you've
[1:00:09] made out of it something to think about
[1:00:14] what are you making with the things with
[1:00:17] the pro' wait on God the Bible says that
[1:00:19] those that wait upon the Lord shall
[1:00:21] renew their strength they shall mount up
[1:00:24] with wings as Eagles listen I've been
[1:00:26] there young man I've been there I've
[1:00:29] been there it's hard I know it's tough
[1:00:35] but I can do all things through Christ
[1:00:38] who strengthens me
[1:00:39] young ladies I can do all things through
[1:00:41] Christ who strengthens me fall in love
[1:00:43] with God fall in love with Christ fall
[1:00:46] in love like like Joseph was in love
[1:00:48] with God in so much that he were not
[1:00:51] even he had the opportunity to
[1:00:53] to do whatever with Potiphar's wife lay
[1:00:56] with his with his with his with with
[1:00:58] Potiphar's wife and he he feared God so
[1:01:02] much that he would not do such things he
[1:01:05] was a young man and that was in the Old
[1:01:09] Testament you have the opportunity to
[1:01:11] have the the Holy Ghost now because they
[1:01:13] can't have the Holy Ghost back then they
[1:01:15] can experience the new birth back then
[1:01:17] you can experience the new birth now how
[1:01:19] much more now with the grace of God and
[1:01:21] the mercy that we have now you're able a
[1:01:25] man God is more than able to keep you in
[1:01:27] this hour I believe that with all my
[1:01:29] heart I believe that you don't you don't
[1:01:33] have to be a puppet for that for the
[1:01:36] world you don't have to be a puppet for
[1:01:37] Satan just because oh well I have this
[1:01:40] need I've got to get I got to do
[1:01:42] something about this no there's a right
[1:01:45] order to take care of those things when
[1:01:49] you do it in the right order everything
[1:01:51] will be just fine you'll be able to
[1:01:53] enjoy that that that cheeseburger meal
[1:01:55] and oh my benefits and growth will come
[1:01:59] out of that I'll leave but when you take
[1:02:03] it out of order in a toxic sludge amen
[1:02:07] nothing will come good nothing good will
[1:02:09] come out of that they can turn that off
[1:02:10] now
[1:02:11] praise God so stay with God's process
[1:02:14] amen
[1:02:18] well because you know if we if we rush a
[1:02:23] man it what it but that does it makes
[1:02:25] God vomit he's looking at your toxic
[1:02:27] sludge you know G he said Jesus said in
[1:02:31] Revelations 3:16 he said because you're
[1:02:33] not hot nor cold I will spew thee out of
[1:02:37] my mouth in other words I will vomit you
[1:02:41] out of my mouth because you're not hot
[1:02:43] you're not cold I like coffee right but
[1:02:48] I like hot coffee but if I want to drink
[1:02:51] cold coffee I'm gonna drink cold coffee
[1:02:53] what they have called iced coffee right
[1:02:57] but I hate lukewarm coffee some coffee
[1:03:01] that's been sitting in the pot for about
[1:03:03] two hours and in the warmer
[1:03:06] gone off ooh I hate that that's nasty
[1:03:10] but I love hot fresh coffee and see if
[1:03:13] Jesus is saying this in the spiritual
[1:03:16] you know if it's like that in the
[1:03:17] physical didn't Jesus bringing it in the
[1:03:19] spiritual that way
[1:03:20] right amen so the Bible says in Psalms
[1:03:23] 34 8 and the brothers have this it says
[1:03:26] o taste and see that the Lord is good
[1:03:30] amen blessed is the man that trusteth in
[1:03:33] him see give the Lord a chance give the
[1:03:37] Lord a chance and you will realize wait
[1:03:39] a second this is much better than the me
[1:03:42] listen to Metallica
[1:03:44] this is much better than me sitting all
[1:03:47] day long playing video games this isn't
[1:03:49] much but gosh what I can't believe I was
[1:03:52] missing this that you realize how good
[1:03:57] god is if you give God a try if you if
[1:04:01] you say o taste and see that the Lord is
[1:04:04] good the Lord is good but see God has to
[1:04:08] reveal that to you when you're when you
[1:04:11] really have that revelation that he is
[1:04:13] good amen
[1:04:14] you you you'll come to his word you'll
[1:04:17] love that coming to the house of God the
[1:04:19] church you'll realize you God God will
[1:04:23] be one revelation after another and then
[1:04:26] what brother Dale is saying up here it
[1:04:28] won't be so ho-hum to you know I I just
[1:04:32] can't understand what brother Dale is
[1:04:33] saying maybe you need more of God maybe
[1:04:38] you need I can't understand what brother
[1:04:40] Wade's preaching about I don't
[1:04:41] understand I hate sitting there an hour
[1:04:44] and a half every every time we come to
[1:04:46] church maybe God is trying to tell you
[1:04:49] something are you listening are you
[1:04:52] really tasting what God is trying to
[1:04:53] feed you
[1:04:54] amen amen now the Bible it gives it
[1:05:00] gives certain examples of there's a lot
[1:05:05] of examples of eating in the Bible we
[1:05:08] know that at the beginning Sam came in
[1:05:12] the picture because of eating or
[1:05:13] partaking right and it wasn't eating a
[1:05:16] literal a literal fruit but it was poor
[1:05:19] taking he was eating
[1:05:20] and here here comes Jesus and the
[1:05:22] scriptures that we read at the bit at
[1:05:24] the beginning and he comes back and says
[1:05:26] well it's like Eve ate the wrong thing
[1:05:30] lusted for knowledge right and Jesus
[1:05:35] comes back and says now it's time to eat
[1:05:37] the true bread of God eating from that
[1:05:40] tree of from that from that tree of life
[1:05:43] that was sealed when Adam and Eve were
[1:05:47] kicked out of the Garden of Eden there
[1:05:50] was a way the guard that angels were
[1:05:52] there guarding from eating from that
[1:05:54] tree of life but now Jesus made a way
[1:05:57] for us to eat off that tree you see he's
[1:06:01] made a way for us to get back and eat
[1:06:03] off that tree and so when Eve was there
[1:06:06] and she was talking you know it didn't
[1:06:08] take it you know when we read it in the
[1:06:11] Bible of what happened in the Garden of
[1:06:12] Eden between the Serpent and the inn and
[1:06:15] Eve we think that it was a thing that
[1:06:17] took place in like ten seconds
[1:06:19] no the serpent could have probably been
[1:06:22] talking to him to her four four five ten
[1:06:25] years whatever if it could have been a
[1:06:27] hundred years I don't know it could have
[1:06:30] been a long time see Satan's patient
[1:06:34] he's patient because when he he knows
[1:06:37] what he wants he knows what his outcomes
[1:06:40] gonna be right so you might as well just
[1:06:42] take whoever he came with him right
[1:06:45] so he's patient then he's gonna do
[1:06:47] everything he can and so he was patient
[1:06:49] with Eve probably had her on snapchat
[1:06:53] chatting with her he said look at here
[1:06:58] you see that Santa sent her the picture
[1:07:03] you can have this you can have this if
[1:07:06] you you know God said don't eat off the
[1:07:10] the the tree or you know what you know
[1:07:13] you know what the scripture says there
[1:07:14] and Eve was like yeah he said you know
[1:07:17] if we eat off of it we'll die so he
[1:07:22] takes another picture probably one of
[1:07:25] himself surely you're not surely die
[1:07:32] surely you'll not die when that slicker
[1:07:38] comes around you know he may not come
[1:07:40] that way but you know there's you can
[1:07:43] tell us laughs ah there can tell when
[1:07:45] the slickers around you know and he
[1:07:52] starts playing you know Bert may be very
[1:07:54] very playful maybe you know trying to
[1:07:56] make you laugh you know if he can get
[1:07:59] you to react that way if he can make you
[1:08:01] laugh if he can make you amen he's
[1:08:04] winning you that's probably what Satan
[1:08:06] was doing with Eve trying to make her
[1:08:09] laugh and then all of a sudden I started
[1:08:12] to it started he started maybe touching
[1:08:14] her head tapping I won't touch him
[1:08:19] wake up trying to touch her head maybe
[1:08:25] and then putting his hand on her
[1:08:28] shoulder you know I'm telling you
[1:08:33] Satan's ass licker Satan's lie Hey
[1:08:38] and he'll be patient and then maybe they
[1:08:40] went back Eve went back to Adam that
[1:08:42] night and said now I'm at this this this
[1:08:45] the serpent you know he's a pretty nice
[1:08:48] guy you know maybe we can get together
[1:08:49] or sometime and have some coffee you
[1:08:51] know and uh
[1:08:53] Adams like okay so here she comes the
[1:08:58] next day she's probably minding her own
[1:09:00] business and here comes mr. slicker
[1:09:02] again hey what's going on girl hey hey
[1:09:09] what you had on was nice yesterday but
[1:09:11] what you got on today is really nice I
[1:09:13] like that I like them shoes out and you
[1:09:17] know you want to start winning a girl
[1:09:20] start talking about her clothes how nice
[1:09:23] her clothes are and stuff like that okay
[1:09:26] maybe just worked for me
[1:09:28] [Laughter]
[1:09:31] all right but Satan Satan's a slicker
[1:09:39] until finally she was convinced she was
[1:09:44] convinced that you know she she was
[1:09:47] gonna be a god you know and and no not
[1:09:51] the good and evil and and be more than
[1:09:54] God and finally she fell in and the
[1:09:56] whole race human race was sold out all
[1:10:00] right
[1:10:01] amen the children of Israel when they
[1:10:05] were when they were leaving the land of
[1:10:08] Egypt right and God told Moses and told
[1:10:12] Aaron and said for them to take a lamb
[1:10:16] or even the Bible says a goat a male
[1:10:18] goat or male lamb and says in in in and
[1:10:22] cook it burn it and eat it the whole
[1:10:29] thing even the Angels all right but
[1:10:34] sometimes we want to pick and choose
[1:10:35] what we want to eat I don't like what
[1:10:39] brother dole said there I'll take that
[1:10:40] but I won't take that but God said for
[1:10:44] you to eat everything if it's the Word
[1:10:47] of God and that lamb represents the
[1:10:49] Jesus Christ and they had to eat with
[1:10:52] with their shoes on their feet they had
[1:10:56] to eat with ready to go and the Bible
[1:11:00] says that they had to eat that food in
[1:11:02] haste that whole thing they had to eat
[1:11:04] it if a hidden haste and not eat it raw
[1:11:06] like I like to eat raw sushi not eat it
[1:11:11] raw but eat it cooked right roasted with
[1:11:17] herbs amen and not watered down either
[1:11:21] it's what it says if you read if you go
[1:11:23] back and read in Exodus they're not
[1:11:25] watered down but sometimes we want to
[1:11:27] water down the Word of God we want to we
[1:11:30] want to just nitpick what we like and
[1:11:32] what we don't like when you know it's in
[1:11:35] the word but you just don't want to
[1:11:36] apply it in your life personally you're
[1:11:38] too proud you don't want to give up your
[1:11:40] pride you don't want to give up what you
[1:11:43] know your your
[1:11:44] your stature in amongst the congregation
[1:11:47] because I don't want to receive that a
[1:11:52] man then you're not leaving Egypt
[1:11:55] you're not leaving Egypt you're in
[1:11:57] bondage still right amen the children of
[1:12:01] it the one time there was a Shadrach
[1:12:07] Meshach and Abednego and when they were
[1:12:11] captured from Bab from Babylon when the
[1:12:15] the children of Israel captured by
[1:12:17] Babylon and they the King said I want
[1:12:21] you to pick one of his servants I want
[1:12:23] you to pick the best young man to come
[1:12:28] and I'm gonna feed them from my meat and
[1:12:30] I'm gonna give him some of my wine I
[1:12:31] want you to pick the best message guys
[1:12:35] they've been in the message all their
[1:12:37] life they were born in this message they
[1:12:39] grew up in this message and I want you
[1:12:44] to bring I want you to feed them and
[1:12:46] give them my meat my choice meat that's
[1:12:48] probably what Satan's one into because
[1:12:50] Satan if you notice I don't know if
[1:12:53] you've noticed but Satan loves to attack
[1:12:54] pastors kids loves to attack those that
[1:12:58] are in position want to try to down the
[1:13:01] the reputation of that man or that woman
[1:13:03] I want I want the best and that's what
[1:13:07] Satan wants he wants the best but he's
[1:13:10] and and so the young people of that day
[1:13:13] those young men they're like but what's
[1:13:15] wrong with with the Kings meat it's
[1:13:17] helping him you know it's good but the
[1:13:20] Bible says that Daniel purposed in his
[1:13:23] heart purposed in his heart out of all
[1:13:26] those message kids who are considering
[1:13:29] leaving the message we're considering
[1:13:32] leaving the word going to the world
[1:13:35] start living like the world going behind
[1:13:38] the mom and dad's back and doing things
[1:13:40] behind their mom and dad's back out of
[1:13:42] all of them there was one that said I
[1:13:44] ain't gonna do that I will not do it I
[1:13:47] was taught better than that by God
[1:13:50] himself by my god I fear my god too much
[1:13:54] Daniel purposed in his heart and you
[1:13:56] know what he
[1:13:57] had it took a lot of risk and it took a
[1:14:01] lot of a lot from him to be able to take
[1:14:03] that stand because the Bible says that
[1:14:05] Daniel purposed in his heart doesn't
[1:14:07] tell us that the other three purposed in
[1:14:08] their heart but because of his testimony
[1:14:10] he won them he wants Shadrach Meshach
[1:14:14] and Abednego you see so if you take a
[1:14:19] stand for Christ if you take a stand for
[1:14:21] what's right then somebody's gonna
[1:14:24] notice that you're like my goodness man
[1:14:27] he takes a stand she takes a stand I
[1:14:29] think I'll just go with that and and so
[1:14:33] Daniel tells the the the king's servant
[1:14:37] says listen we don't want any of this
[1:14:39] meat because it's sacrificed to gods
[1:14:41] it's been it's been offered to gods we
[1:14:43] don't want this wine because it's been
[1:14:45] given to gods we don't want to have
[1:14:47] anything to do with that because the
[1:14:48] Israelite people didn't they weren't
[1:14:50] supposed to do that
[1:14:51] and so just feed us vegetables feed us
[1:14:54] feed us because least you know these
[1:15:00] beans and vegetables and rice and things
[1:15:03] like that and you wait 10 days now the
[1:15:05] king he was he told his servants like
[1:15:08] let's wait three years after three years
[1:15:10] I'll check back with you after they've
[1:15:12] been eating my meat to see if they've
[1:15:14] been how they are how but at Daniel he
[1:15:19] had so much faith in his God that God
[1:15:21] was going to be right there pouring the
[1:15:22] exact vitamins that he needs pouring
[1:15:25] everything that he needs for the food
[1:15:26] that they were eating they he's like you
[1:15:28] he wants to wait three years I just give
[1:15:31] us ten days and look at us after that
[1:15:33] and if you keep reading there and the
[1:15:35] Bible says after ten days they looked
[1:15:37] much healthier then then then then the
[1:15:41] ones they were enjoying the Kings meat
[1:15:43] and the Bible says that they were filled
[1:15:46] with wisdom and the King Nebuchadnezzar
[1:15:48] after three years they realized my
[1:15:51] goodness he was surprised how Daniel was
[1:15:54] how he grew in the Lord you see when you
[1:15:57] take a stand in faith for what's right
[1:15:59] God's gonna back you up hey man God's
[1:16:02] gonna back you up the Sara Phoenician
[1:16:05] women woman when she was saying came to
[1:16:07] the Lord screaming out Lord Lord help me
[1:16:10] my daughter is vexed
[1:16:11] Beck's with the devil and Jesus had to
[1:16:14] write all the right to tell her you the
[1:16:16] meet this this did I'm given to you this
[1:16:18] food is not for you because she was a
[1:16:20] Gentile and he had already told his
[1:16:23] disciples do not go by the way of the
[1:16:25] Gentiles
[1:16:26] so here's Jesus here's Jesus he's he's
[1:16:28] he's about to break what he had told his
[1:16:31] disciples and so and so the woman says
[1:16:36] it he says it's not jesus tells her it's
[1:16:39] not meat for me to give this food to you
[1:16:41] dogs
[1:16:42] it's not me uh-uh you're you're a dog
[1:16:45] and I can't give you this food this food
[1:16:46] but she said in faith she had faith in
[1:16:50] those little crumbs she said but Lord I
[1:16:53] know you're right
[1:16:54] see when you when you break when you let
[1:16:56] your pride go and you say you know what
[1:16:59] what he's saying is right
[1:17:00] well she's what my mom and dad are
[1:17:02] telling me is right and you let your
[1:17:05] pride go and you realize and you have
[1:17:07] faith in what that word of God that word
[1:17:09] of God will will give you exactly what
[1:17:12] you need and so she said but even even
[1:17:15] the crumbs that fall from the master
[1:17:17] table the dogs are able to enjoy and
[1:17:19] that just one Jesus he's like I can't
[1:17:23] believe this
[1:17:23] I've had not seen faith like this by
[1:17:26] anybody else in Jerusalem amen and he
[1:17:29] told the woman go and have what you want
[1:17:31] amen so even even that's why I was
[1:17:34] saying even the little crumbs that you
[1:17:37] may get from a service if you take those
[1:17:39] in faith they'll go a long way a long
[1:17:43] way you may not understand everything
[1:17:46] that all the quotes and everything
[1:17:48] anyway but just take the little crumbs
[1:17:50] they'll give you what you need
[1:17:52] amen God is concerned about amen so the
[1:17:55] and just finishing up right here hey man
[1:18:00] how many love the Lord a man don't get
[1:18:03] sleepy on me amen we read we read here
[1:18:09] in Revelation in Revelation chapter 10
[1:18:11] verse 8 it says that the verse says
[1:18:17] level is just was just read it I'm sorry
[1:18:19] it says that the brothers could bring it
[1:18:23] up
[1:18:31] revelation 10 8 says and the voice which
[1:18:35] I heard this is John now and the voice
[1:18:37] which I heard from heaven spake unto me
[1:18:40] again and said go and take the little
[1:18:42] book which is open in the hand of the
[1:18:45] angel which standeth upon the sea and
[1:18:47] upon the earth all right so that book
[1:18:51] that book was open it was open it was an
[1:18:55] open book that Jesus Christ opened Jesus
[1:18:58] Christ no man was able to break these
[1:19:00] seals only the Lord Jesus was able to
[1:19:02] break these seals right so the book was
[1:19:05] open when John was saying this in verse
[1:19:07] 9 is this and I went unto the angel and
[1:19:10] said unto Him and give me the little
[1:19:12] book and he said unto me take it and eat
[1:19:16] it up all right and they shall make thy
[1:19:19] belly bitter but it shall be in thy
[1:19:22] mouth sweet as honey so this thing
[1:19:25] starts a man this thing starts the chaos
[1:19:29] of sin comes in into this world by
[1:19:32] eating and it ends up in eating now you
[1:19:38] and me have to eat the book amen
[1:19:42] you and me have to eat amen it was one
[1:19:47] time I was it was one time a death to go
[1:19:53] in behind the inner veil to go into into
[1:19:56] the Ark of God only the priests were
[1:19:58] able to go in there now it's death if
[1:20:00] you don't go back there amen
[1:20:04] it's death if you don't go back in there
[1:20:06] and he says in verse 10 10 and I took
[1:20:10] the little book out of the Angels hand
[1:20:12] and ate it and it was and it was in my
[1:20:16] mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I
[1:20:20] had eaten it my belly was bitter that's
[1:20:23] what happens when you decide that you
[1:20:24] want to serve the Lord for for real you
[1:20:27] really want to serve God you really want
[1:20:30] to take take the chance and you really
[1:20:32] want to risk everything like Daniel
[1:20:34] risks could risk everything on that sir
[1:20:35] finish and risked everything you really
[1:20:37] want
[1:20:38] go at it it's gonna be sweet at first oh
[1:20:42] it's fun okay I love serving the Lord I
[1:20:46] love serving God and then I come home
[1:20:48] and I see that Grand Theft Auto oh I
[1:20:53] love that game too but you have to make
[1:20:57] a decision what is that gonna feed my
[1:21:00] soul or is that gonna hurt me more right
[1:21:04] it's gonna be bitter for some of us some
[1:21:07] of us it's a you think you come to be a
[1:21:09] Christian and it's a probably better
[1:21:11] these and sometimes that's when that's
[1:21:13] when you have more problems in life I
[1:21:14] said it happened to me more issues and
[1:21:18] more problems in life when you come
[1:21:19] serving the Lord so it's sweet yes it's
[1:21:22] sweet sweet as honey by the way but it's
[1:21:26] bitter like those herbs that they ate
[1:21:28] back in the in the Exodus that's why
[1:21:31] they had to have those bitter in there
[1:21:33] as well
[1:21:34] you see amen and he said unto me
[1:21:39] revelaed last verse verse 11 and he said
[1:21:41] unto me thou must prophesy again before
[1:21:43] many peoples and nations and tongues and
[1:21:45] kings it's our it's our we are to do
[1:21:48] that work that Jesus Christ didn't
[1:21:50] finish when he was here on earth brother
[1:21:53] Brandon said that we are to finish it up
[1:21:55] you and I God is gonna have a adult to
[1:22:01] do that God's gonna have a young person
[1:22:03] as an overcomer God's gonna have a
[1:22:04] middle-aged person that's an overcomer
[1:22:06] God's gonna have even a child as an
[1:22:08] overcomer and this hour why because he
[1:22:10] said so there's gonna be a people
[1:22:12] there's gonna be spot without spot
[1:22:14] without wrinkle I hope that you say that
[1:22:16] you're that one and that you make a
[1:22:18] decision in your heart tonight
[1:22:19] that I will not be defiled by the Kings
[1:22:22] meat anymore
[1:22:23] that I will not be defiled by Babylon
[1:22:26] anymore Babylon meaning Hollywood and
[1:22:29] all these things that the world provides
[1:22:31] i-i-i-i-i purpose in my heart that I
[1:22:34] will not go that way anymore
[1:22:36] because that is not helping me grow in
[1:22:38] the stature of a perfect man amen
[1:22:43] Merle Branham says here now our bodies
[1:22:46] need food and drink each day to survive
[1:22:48] listen to this the brothers they can
[1:22:51] bring it up if they have it
[1:22:52] our physical body if we don't take food
[1:22:55] each day and drink than our body weakens
[1:22:57] there's something in us that we must
[1:23:00] have food a month there's something in
[1:23:05] us that we must have food one day's food
[1:23:07] will not last for the next day we can go
[1:23:10] with that about the manna and everything
[1:23:12] but lack of time you've got to have food
[1:23:17] each day to strengthen your mortal beam
[1:23:19] right you can live over but you're
[1:23:22] weaker and the second day you're still
[1:23:25] weaker and the third day you're getting
[1:23:27] tremendously weaker well that's what
[1:23:31] many times that we do in the spiritual
[1:23:34] realm you see each day we've got to
[1:23:36] commune with Christ we've got to talk to
[1:23:40] him each day we've got to settle it with
[1:23:43] him each day Paul said I die each day
[1:23:47] see each day I die yet I live not me but
[1:23:51] Christ lives in me so if your physical
[1:23:55] body needs food each day and drink each
[1:23:57] day to survive your spiritual body needs
[1:24:00] spiritual food and communion with the
[1:24:02] Lord each day to survive
[1:24:03] not just on Wednesdays and Sundays yes
[1:24:07] Jesus said man shall not live by bread
[1:24:10] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[1:24:12] out of the mouth of God so each day
[1:24:14] we've got to study the Bible this is
[1:24:17] your prophet speaking each day we've got
[1:24:20] to study the Bible some people doesn't
[1:24:22] study it at all some picks it up every
[1:24:29] two or three times a year
[1:24:30] I hope there's nobody here like that but
[1:24:36] a real real believer that's really
[1:24:38] spiritually built up he reads his Bible
[1:24:40] every day and talks to the Lord that's
[1:24:45] right he has two men shall not live by
[1:24:48] bread alone but by every word that
[1:24:50] proceedeth out of the mouth of God right
[1:24:53] and that's why that's why in 1st
[1:24:56] Corinthians chapter 10 verse 16 says
[1:24:58] this listen what it says the cup of
[1:25:01] blessing which we bless it is not the
[1:25:03] communion of the blood of Christ
[1:25:05] the bread which we break is it not the
[1:25:09] communion of the body of Christ verse 17
[1:25:12] for we being many are one bread right in
[1:25:16] one body for we are all partakers of
[1:25:19] that one bread so you want to be the
[1:25:22] bread that others can feed off of when
[1:25:24] they're around you you feed off the
[1:25:27] bread of life amen
[1:25:29] because when you feed off the bread of
[1:25:31] life amen
[1:25:32] you'll become that bread that Living
[1:25:34] bread that others can also benefit from
[1:25:36] you as well I was thirsty this water was
[1:25:47] in here hey amen
[1:26:02] but now this aquafina water isn't me you
[1:26:07] can't see it but it's doing something in
[1:26:10] my life amen
[1:26:12] I feed off the bread of God Jesus Christ
[1:26:15] he'll be in you so that others can feed
[1:26:17] off of you a man praise God how many
[1:26:19] love the Lord Amen let's stand to our
[1:26:21] feet I hope that you just don't take
[1:26:28] this and say oh that's just brother
[1:26:30] Louise he's up there you know and he's
[1:26:33] just trying to be funny and he's trying
