the expenses but if you have anything you want to give to him you just take care of it yourself and do it okay all right Open the Eyes of My Heart Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you amen Open the Eyes of My Heart openly eyes of my heart I won't received shining in the light of your glory lifted up shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing the whole little holy holy Holy Holy Holy Angels amen Lord God we love you and we just appreciate your holy presence in our midst and we just healed ourselves Lord before you there's nothing we can do except you move within us Lord and you just touch this little lips Lord you have created this for your purpose and may the hearts made the ears Lord that will hear your word amen Lord thank you for making us deserving and worthy through your blood and this morning we just give all the glory and honor into your mighty name in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen hallelujah God bless you amen maybe I give you time to sit down for a while and uh uh I just want to give space uh from my little congregation back there in caloocan Metro Manila I send you greetings and we'd always pray for you as we believe we're doing the same thing amen and uh well we really appreciate brother Samuel Dale for his uh continued burden to the bride of Christ in the Philippines and uh I know you are always part of it and let me tell you this morning that we miss brother Wade's presence last year we were expecting him to speak for our church anniversary meeting but we always do that every year but by the way the End Amen so you still have another year if the Lord Paris we do that every second Sunday of March and also better Nestor that's it first week of March and uh it always go use uh good to go there end of the month because every first Monday of the month weekend monthly ministers meeting and in that way you're going to meet a lot of ministers more amen so of course I appreciate about the team Whitener for accommodating me because I've been otherwise I will be hanging for a week somewhere amen and he drove me here uh I just realized it's it's not it's not close amen so uh because there are certain things I always stay here you know and this is my second home away from home and I always stay with brother Sam's Place and of course I missed that I missed that Bass Pro Tour this year amen but if the Lord tires I'm gonna make it next year Hallelujah so well uh the the harvest is ripe amen and uh everywhere we go God is always guiding us to new open doors and uh the the things that he had opened not only in the Philippines but also in many parts of Southeast Asia where I have been involved well as I have been telling you I have been involved in Indonesia for uh say more than 10 years 2003 we started going there and uh we started having three establishers at that time in separate Islands too far from each other but for the very first time at that time we were able to conduct joint meetings and that started the role and in 2004 we conducted this mystery Exposition and it earned a lot of good result and now the good thing the Brethren are doing they were out of their shell doing the Mission Works and uh that's the main purpose that we always do because as the prophet said let the native save and get the native save and let the native preach to his own people you know so we don't we're not building any Kingdom we just want to promote God's kingdom everywhere we go and the way I see it in Indonesia now we have more than a dozen churches over there and uh well uh rooted ministers God has produced or uh for years and uh now they're they're willing and sacrificing also to reach out and out of the 90 percent of 250 million uh yeah Muslim amen we have churches over there and more than a dozen probably more than 20 we include some of the small house meetings but the Lord has opened up new doors I think two weeks before my trip to the U.S I was able to make a follow-up in Myanmar and there's a lot of good things going on in Myanmar because way back three four years ago it was still under military Junta and you see soldiers everywhere and it's not easy to travel because the moment you step on the immigration you have to you should have a fixed itinerary and you cannot stay in the believer's house you need to go back and they check you if you go back in the hotel and it is so expensive to go there but the Lord has opened up recently just last year the U.S is so active now in uh in in Myanmar it has opened up a lot and I believe it also opened up doors to the to the message of the hour and uh praise the Lord this is all God's doing and that trip uh provided us a a very wide open door because one one brother helped me sat down with with you know I would say experience Minister also but in the denomination and we were talking and just the Lord has you know that's that that meeting and and that brother invited me to preach in his church and I was committed to the message uh church already but I I talked to the brother you know this is one opportunity that we do not want to miss and uh so that the brother let me go and I ministered to that Pastor he's uh I think he's 62 years old and uh by God's grace you know uh we shared some simple thoughts some simple things in the message but right after the the meeting by God's for God's glory he was rejoicing and somebody was interpreting he said that this uh old Minister said you know I have been 20 years in the ministry and uh Pastor Danny read the same scriptures we have been reading most of the time but by God's grace uh we were enlightened the this is the only time I have seen those scriptures being shared the way it was this morning and so pray for this we need your prayers and so after that meeting he pulled me in his office and in that office he showed me a map and in that map there are I counted probably 33 stars and in those Stars he said you know of my 20 years in the ministry this is the fruit that the Lord has given me 33 churches in different islands and then the next thing that he did he pulled the calendar and he said brother Danny in November I am willing to invite the workers ministers and a market he said I can gather at least 150 workers out of this because they're under my Ministry and they will listen to the message that you're going that you are saying so please amen please include that in your prayer will I we will keep you posted on those things and also Japan I have been to Japan twice and I am scheduled to be back there uh in in October uh and last time I was there I baptized at least two young young people and and his mother and there are also Filipino working in Japan they are believers and now the Lord has provided me some contact because when I was in brother Gerald Duke's Church there is a there is a family there that uh the mother of of the sister was a Japanese and he he's just married to uh to an American brother and they will be there in October at the same time I will be there so I believe this is all God's doing and he said we will we will uh you know our family and we will be there and Lord willing or I'm going to gonna be busy in Japan so in other words little by little I'm fading out in Indonesia maybe I used to go there twice three times a year but maybe I'm going to do it uh once a year probably little by little you know because the Lord is opening up more new doors you know I've been I've been a burdened so much uh for Japan because when I read you know when brother Branham said we know he has I mean he's making some itineraries and said maybe we're going to drop by the Philippines and next Japan you know he mentioned that once but when I read it you know he's not been to Japan or to the Philippines but the message went to the Philippines and now you know the Lord has opened up a door and said Lord if you uh I can find favor and if you're going to use me in Japan just provide the way for me and Lord willing in October that will be my third trip to Japan so with all these things there's a lot of things to to talk about the mission field that just I'm giving you just a peep on those things because I know you have been praying and you have been part of and uh of course this brother but the team is also helping quite a bit in providing Bibles for the new converts and with the disaster that we had and we certainly appreciate all the uh all the help that you're doing amen so but on top of that this morning let's let's all stand up in respect to the reading of the word Hallelujah amen so I'm always encouraged to be beside seasoned and experienced ministers like Brother Sam amen he always make makes me feel comfortable amen so let's read in second Samuel chapter 11. this is a very familiar scripture foreign but I know we're going to to head on with the rest of the scriptures this is very familiar with us but may the Lord give us uh point of view to see what he Wills on this now he says in verse 1 and it came to pass after the year was expired the time when kings go forth to battle that David sent joa and his servants with him and all Israel and they destroyed the children of Ammon and besides rabba but David tarid still at Jerusalem amen I believe that makes the problem for David let's bar heads in prayer dear heavenly father we thank you this morning we give ourselves and uh we we submit and Lord we recognize that we cannot do anything Lord once again this morning you just have your own way Lord and you speak your word with liberty and uh uh may this little sermon God be a help and an encouragement to your people in Jesus Christ's name we thank you everybody say amen amen hallelujah God bless you amen you may be seated thank you Lord for his Mercy amen so we just want just want to give a title to this sermon recognizing the value of our position amen I believe so much has been uh said and told about this portion of the scripture where David you know fell in fell in scene and uh he suffered a lot of consequences because of that you know but uh there's just a simple thought that I would like to drive you by God's help that led uh David to suffer all the consequences that happened after which amen so you see in this verse uh of course Israel is always at War amen just like right now I once again they are at War but in this kind of War this is a different War as we see in the scripture he says and it came to pass after the year was expired at the year when kings go forth to battle amen so this is not an ordinary battle this is not an ordinary War but this is a kind of War as I understood in the scripture that even Kings has to leave their Throne has to leave the palace and join the battle amen so that means they uh this is the kind of war that they have to risk everything because once the other Kingdom you know uh get the king and and the king of one kingdom is being killed that means that kingdom is being concurred amen so you see this is some kind of a war that takes great men in the field and including the king himself Hallelujah and so that's why we come to a point that we need to recognize uh the value of our position right so David recognized amen all his life the value of the position we knew we knew David even when he was young you know he had that kind of character he showed that the courage when nobody wanted to stand against Goliath he was there amen a teenager and uh uh uh realizing he was he he was the king he was already anointed as the next king to Israel but somehow he was able to risk his life because he could not take that that uncircumcised Philistine like like Goliath would insult God Amen before their face amen and so what have happened and along along the way we see how how David uh displaying that kind of character Soul was so uh insecure and he even wanted to kill David but David showed character amen but all these things at this point in time everything was gone in David you see it's this is a different David and and the way I see it is that David was not in his right post of Duty amen amen so now when we recognize the value of our position you know the Bible said in in Revelation we were made Kings and also we were made priests that we will be but we were made Kings and Priests so uh uh uh and in that point as the the the bride the wife of the Lord Jesus Christ we should fully at this point in time recognize the value of our position being the bread of the Lord Jesus Christ amen the value of this message in our lives amen uh now this is not some kind of a simple thing that's why we don't believe that this is this message is another religion another organization another denomination we look beyond that we value this message more than this word could offer right Hallelujah that's why we give our lives to the message of the hour I mean I remember that uh that little kid you know one time that uh uh uh every day they they they they were expecting that ice cream man to pass by and uh but one day his mother could not give him something to buy you know even a a single Cent to buy a cup of ice cream amen and so this this uh this lad was so disappointed and and because all his Playmates were were online you know already buying buying ice cream cups of ice cream but he alone at that very moment he didn't he didn't have anything to buy with so but he remembered brother Barnum said he remembered one thing you know he went up the attic and then pulled that old uh uh luggage and you know because he remembered there was a stump there and then uh he because he knew there is a stamp collector on the other on the other side of the road and he took the Stop and he just uh went straight you know while the ice cream man was waiting you know he he presented the stamp the stump collector and he said how much you will give me for this amen and brother Benham said the first thing that stamp collector said well I can give you a dollar for that yeah amen and because he's scared he's young he said that dollar at that time is something you know he thought of uh that's already 100 cups of ice cream that's how far that young boy could think of that stump amen just a hundred cups of ice cream and so you know he got excited and then he he gave the stam and here comes another you know a dollar you know handed to him and he ran and then he called all his Playmates come on lined up again I'm going to treat you this day amen I've got a lot of cups in here amen but the next thing that have happened is that stamp collector aiming closed his store and went to the town and because uh uh the stump collector you know could give him more than that yeah amen and he said you know the next thing it costs hundred dollars the next it was 500 and brother Branham said the last the last amount I heard amen was that stamp cost a quarter of a million dollars and it's going on yeah yeah amen because people realize the value of that stamp amen it's more than a dollar it's more than 500 bucks it's more than a thousand amen it's even more than you know a quarter of a million dollars for that stump because it's so valuable for those who understand right amen for those who knows what it is amen but you see amen this kid don't understand the value that's how far he could think of it a hundred cups of ice cream amen brothers and sisters it's the same thing with the message of the hour Hallelujah for other people this is just a membership but we go beyond that this message of the hour is life of Jesus Christ in the bride Hallelujah so that's why we realize and recognize the value and then when we when we realize and recognize the value of something that we hold in our hand then we know how to conduct ourselves we know how to live our lives amen we know amen we know how to to to take care amen and be always right about right on our post of Duty amen but remember amen this point in time David amen David found himself in such a condition he never expected right right he would have been right Hallelujah and the reason for that because although he was a king at that time he was supposed to be not on his throne right right he was supposed to be in the battle amen but instead he said he uh instead of being there David sent Joe up and his servants with him and all Israel and they destroyed the children of Ammon so you see even if he wasn't there because God was with his people yeah amen his Warriors kept on advancing amen Killing Children Killing uh Killing Children of Ammon and besides rabba amen but David buried in Jerusalem yeah so while David was there and his Warriors were winning the battles David was fighting his own battle and he was gradually losing it right because he was not in the rightful position Hallelujah so that's the main thing and so amen he went down and down and and the thing Beyond you know when Beyond his control Beyond his expectation Hallelujah and now it sees uh so we know what the next thing that ever happened it came to pass in verse 2 in an evening time that David arose from up his bed and walked upon the roof of the King's house and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself and the woman was very beautiful to look upon Amen to have that kind of description that that woman was very beautiful he must look so closely with it he focused so much in it until the curtain was closed amen and then the next thing that have happened you know the following day the following day of course the king you know the president of the country the president that he could think of Amen when he wakes up amen of course his his soldiers his Warriors are in the battle you know a normal King should ask what's going on in the battlefield amen are we winning do we still have enough supplies amen do we we still have enough Warriors or armies over there shall we send more amen but the following day it was totally different the person that he asked was who is that woman right amen so is who is that woman and and and and and his soldiers around him he said and he said it's not this Bathsheba the daughter of Ilium the wife of Uriah the type amen so David should have stopped right there yeah it's the wife of his loyal faithful Warrior exactly amen but nobody would expect amen that the next thing that he did David sent Messengers to get Bathsheba and David had amen had a child to to cut the story short amen so it's it's gradually David was drifting and drifting amen and now that he was he made he made he failed you know uh he he sinned against God and he knew it and now because David knew the mind of God because David is a man after God's Own Heart he knew God is is graceful in your he knew God loved him so much amen but but now David wanted to to do something he wanted to make a remedy to make it right amen and so there is something that was working behind his head now to justify himself he could not take Bathsheba totally as long as Uriah is alive right amen and so he had to do something and he has to do it upon himself in his own hand Hallelujah and that's the same thing but praise the Lord you know when we are in the will of the Lord God is always in control he's the one doing everything for us amen he will do amen David was working to justify himself right now that's the problem you know that's the problem when we when we when when a person goes away from the will of the Lord he has to make all remedies you know he has to try all avenues you know uh plan a plan B you know all this stuff was to be made by a person that goes away from the will of the Lord hallelujah now but praise the Lord amen uh uh God God knows and God is taking good care of us but just let's just let us just see amen how the Lord has dealt with David and then we we know the rest of the story and and you see uh he's now he sent message to joa to to bring him Uriah and and look at Uriah you know when when he went back to the king and and and and and and hypocrite David said are you not going to visit your wife yeah amen and the words of Uriah was so clear why should I you know why should I visit my wife while my fellow Warriors are fighting on the battlefield some of them dying some of them wounded and why should I take pleasure I'm not that selfish Uriah was not that selfish and also amen he stayed you know not far from his King amen he was still doing things in favor of his King because Uriah recognized the value of his position amen and so now the next thing you know uh uh Uriah David wrote a letter and this letter was handed to uh to joab and job you know you could imagine well job was reading that letter and he was looking at Uriah and then in that letter says amen send Uriah to the hottest battle and when when you are engaged amen you just uh uh you just leave him there and make sure he will die it's a murder right right there right right and job realizing his position also he knew amen I believe he knew something he knew something was going on but somehow because of his loyalty and somehow he he remained in his position he gave due respect to his King and he has to obey the word of his King right Hallelujah and and so amen it happened then and and you see all these things have happened Beyond anybody's normal thinking right yeah yeah and yet it happened Hallelujah it happened now let me read the scripture a quotation here we have the first quotation and it's quoted in the exposition of the seven Church ages now of course this is about the church aides he said now the very name Ephesus has a strange compound meaning aimed at and relaxed the high aspirations of this age that had begun with the fullness of the spirit the depth of God whereby they were aiming at the High Calling of God began to give way to a less watchful attitude a less Arden following of Jesus Christ began to manifest itself as an omen that in the future ages the physical vehicle called The Church would sing to the awfulness of the depth of Satan it had become relaxed and was drifting right right amen David relaxed yeah yeah amen he just opted to stay David taried amen he just relaxed a little bit maybe you know I believe David wasn't a coward he was willing to to go to the battle being the king but by just little time of relaxation maybe he said you know I'm going to follow me next day or next week I'm not going to be long but in that little less watchful attitude and Satan knows that oh yeah amen Satan knows that and you know that we believe that in the message of the hour brother said Satan knows our position right and that's why Satan is trying his best for us not to be in our rightful position because the moment we are in our rightful position man we are we are invincible Army Hallelujah so that's why Satan is trying Amen to to make us a way to hinder Us number one he he doesn't want for us to recognize our position amen and the next thing is amen if he knows we recognize our position the next thing that he he know he doesn't want is for us to occupy our position so it will do everything and so now amen realizing Satan knew this now that David was not in his rightful position he remains to be the king he was but he was not functioning the way he should be because the king Amen in this kind of War this is the the word the Kings go for it for battle Hallelujah not only not only generals not only Warriors but Kings amen so now it had become relaxed and was drifting already the age was backsliding and it had left its first love the Tiny Seed amen the tiny seed planted it that Ephesian aids would one day grow in the spirit of error until all foul birds of the air would Roost in its branches so in offensive to human reasoning would that little plant appear to that new EVE the new church that again she would be deceived by Satan the efficient AIDS had presented to her the opportunity for God's best and for a while she prevailed and then relax and in that unguarded moment Satan planted the seed of complete ruination that little tiny seed amen went on and on and on for that complete realization ruination ruination Hallelujah so a lot of things and then it continued on and and so now after all these things amen we know that during this this time that that now David realized where he is because something has taken place the joy that he used to experience now he was in search of he knew he remains to be a son of God amen because in that song you know uh uh he wrote in Psalms 51 you know he knows you know he restore there is something he knew something has left him that's why he was saying restore unto me the joy of thy salvation salvation you know God is not an Indian giver you know he remained to be a Son of God he knew he's saved salvation is there he believed God to be his own Savior and yet something is missing right there he was looking for something because it wasn't there anymore he said Lord restore to me the joy he was there in his throne but there's no joy he's in the palace he remained all the possession he he keep all these things upon himself and yet there was no joy and what is that what what what is the beauty of of having all this kind of stuff without that kind of joy hallelujah amen but praise God hallelujah so that that's the main thing why we continue to serve the Lord amen because the joy is there you wake up early you travel long you go you go you come here not of course we want to see each other we want to meet each other and seek one another's hand but somehow there is a joy higher than that and that is the joy of hearing his word amen the joy of his presence Hallelujah but there are there are people that can sit on the pews but never have that kind of Joy right right because somewhere somehow they're hiding something amen like David he was sitting in his throne maybe that is your rightful position maybe you know every time you're sitting right there amen but if you feel that the joy isn't there anymore I mean it's the time once again to pray kneel down and appeal to God Lord hallelujah something is wrong somewhere Hallelujah because that's the key when we have the joy of serving the lord amen that's the key when we have that kind of Joy service is all is all over the place but where's the joy amen that's why you know when uh uh uh said when you have that kind of joy you know you cannot wait for them doors to to open we'll be right there amen because there is something that's that keeps pulling you amen so thank God so now uh but every time every time Sons and Daughters of God now this is something we're preaching this to the Sons and Daughters of God the serpency could not understand this right amen you tell them you know I'm a predestinated Son of God your God is unfair amen but God is always Fair amen because he is always giving me favor right and that's fair when you always enjoyed the favor it's fair amen and that's my Lord amen because when when when you know when during the time when I don't know him during the time when I was a sinner yet he loved me amen and that's the greatest favor in his blood covers everything during the time and even in the uh even in the person he said you know his blood was covering the ignorance of the people and who's that people the bride because he we don't we didn't know who we were or who we are amen so you see amen now amen God always has a remedy for his people right you remember Abraham you know he told a lie to abimelech and yet with all these things you know Abraham reap all the favors amen and and said Lord why why should I why should I have this kind of treatment with all the Integrity of my heart amen but but you know God said amen go back to my to my Prophet amen speak to him amen ask prayer for him let his hand lay lay upon you and let him pray for you and give him gifts amen so you see amen it's the same thing with David right right it's the same thing with David and so God was there and the only thing no person no officer in the palace not a single person in that Kingdom would correct David right right except a prophet right right Hallelujah so every time there is a major error God will send a prophet amen and so Nathan amen he he called Nathan and and what have happened in chapter 12 when the Lord sent Nathan and to David then he came unto him and said unto him there were two men in one city the one rich and the other poor now this is wisdom amen you know they're so close Nathan knew David so well and the moment Nathan was there by just looking at David he knew something is wrong the glory wasn't there anymore right Hallelujah you know and the rich man had exceeding many flags and hurts but the poor man had nothing saved one little you lamb which he had bought and Norris up and it grew up together with demon with his children it did it of his own meat and drank Robison cup and laying his bosom and was unto him as a daughter and there came a traveler unto the rich man and he spared to take of his own flock and knob his own herd to dress for that wayfaring man that was common to him but took the poor man's lemon dressed for the man that was come to him and David's anger was greatly kindled against the man and he said to Nathan as the Lord lived you know sometimes people even when they're they're in the room they can still quote God they could still quote brother branham's statement you know they're so you know proud and you know we know the message we know God you know and they're easy to judge they're in the wrong and yet they're easy to judge amen like David and David's anger was greatly kindled against the man and he said to Nathan as the Lord liveth the man that had done this thing shall surely die and he shall restore the lamb fourfold because he did this thing and because he had no pity right yeah amen Nathan said you're right amen and that man David is you right Hallelujah but you know what good thing in David that's why he is a man after God's Own Heart Right you know he respected the prophet of God right yeah and because of that respect David made it right yeah yeah you know something have taken place and and in that moment you know in that in that single moment of relaxation you know spiritual Amnesia came in to David and look at the mess that have happened after which Hallelujah but also in that single moment amen that he respected the prophet of God right amen just right there David humbled himself and once again the man after God's Own Heart who knew how to Humble himself who knew how to respect God's Prophet who knew how to uh uh you know to to to to to to take necessary steps to be back to the Lord hallelujah and and I believe David repented so hard and repentance is the king amen amen repentance is the key amen no no no justification on our side because justification only comes from the Lord and by sending that Prophet was already a justification in favor of David because God knew that the frap the prophet is the only way for David to get correct Hallelujah and so amen so we know what have happened even the even the the child of uh uh of David to Bathsheba he got sick and you know until he died amen and uh we're not going to go on details on that but let me just tell you something in here in verse 29 of chapter 12. second chapter second Samuel chapter 12 verse 29 when all these things have happened David was restored and so now you know when when he wrote this song in Psalms 51 you know it it is it was specifically uh that was specifically about his experience about Bathsheba and all the things the incidents that surround amen surrounded that that that experience that failure amen but I just want to go move forward on verse 29 well well David was just right there fighting his own battle losing everything the war on the other side was advancing little by little amen now in verse 29 after David made himself corrected get himself corrected you know he wore the right clothes amen he started to eat cleaned himself up because now he recognized well I was pleading to the Lord because you know he might give me favor to give back the life of my son but now that he made the decision so you see now the good thing in David is coming back because now after recognizing amen now after recognizing the prophet now he recognized whatever he recognized whatever happens he loved that child so much and yet God took that right but he was not hurt now all things work together for good amen because he did the person he recognized the prophet he had great respect for him and now he recognized whatever God does it will be on his favor so he recognized the up God being absolute in his life so his people ask him how come amen before you were you were passing you were praying amen you're not cleaning yourself but now when your child die him and you you clean up yourself now you're eating you seem to be normal yeah amen he said what's wrong with you God made the decision he's my absolute now once again Hallelujah and so now amen that's why in verse 29 and David guided all the people together and went to rabba and fought against it and took it but prior to that there's one good scripture in verse 28 on the side of of job and I really appreciate this verse 27 I would say let's read and job sent Messengers to David and said I have fought against rabba and have taken the city of waters now therefore gather the rest of the people together and income against the city and take it lest I take the city and it be called after my name what a man what a word you're under the king what a faithful servant or Warrior of David amen he had all the opportunities to advance he had all the opportunities to make a name for himself right and yet with that kind of respect he knew the value of his position he knew amen he cannot go beyond that right and he stayed in his position and he said King David amen we will keep our Advance amen we're winning the battle and we're just close to that and he sent Messengers to David and he said King David come over amen because amen if you if you if you delay your your your when you join us amen I might take yeah the kingdom and it will be after my name what a respect right on the side of job right so he stood right there waiting for the king to come amen and take on the kingdom and David was there right on the time amen and so you see that's the same thing in the ministry that's the same thing in the mission field amen we go in a place where winning the battle we're winning we're winning Souls not for ourselves amen we're winning souls for him amen they were not taking names Upon Our Own but we give all the glory upon the Lord Jesus Christ I believe that's the right attitude amen that we should help amen that that the Bride of Jesus Christ continue to magnify in this hour we're not lifting up any name we're not lifting up any organization but we're lifting up our King and that's Jesus Christ and I believe that's the same thing that brother Branham said I did not uh uh I was not able to give this to the brother but let me read this script this quotation and I like this also in EX in the church ages brother Benham said not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me or join my church or start some fellowship and organization I have never done that and will not do that now right right I have no interest in those things but I do have an interest in the things of God and people and if I accomplish just one thing right I will be satisfied that one thing is to see establish a true spiritual relationship between God and Men wherein men become New Creations in Christ filled with the spirit and live according to his word I would invite plead and warn all to hear his voice at this time and yield yourselves completely to him even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to him God bless you and may his coming Rejoice your heart oh I love that Hallelujah that's why I see this thing in job amen his respect upon King David King David come because this is yours Hallelujah that's why I see when I was reading this scripture I just close for a while my Bible then I said ah if only second summer chapter 11 verse 1. and then you proceed on because this is the time when kings go for it for battle and then you read second Samuel chapter 12 verse 29 when King David was already in the battle and then he took the king he took the crown amen and so you see verse 2 of chapter 11. until verse 28 of chapter 12. these were all permissible simply because David did not accomplish His function as the king amen so this is the same thing in our lives amen amen but God through his blood amen remove all these things Hallelujah so only because you know David was not in his right place I believe I believe that Solomon was predestinated by God to be the son of David and not upon any woman it must be true Bathsheba Solomon true Bathsheba right but Uriah could not produce a Solomon out of Bathsheba right because it's not the perfect will it's not the perfect will of God although Uriah was good Uriah was faithful amen and yet he's not the predestinated father for Solomon it must be David and it must be true Bathsheba Hallelujah we saw that in in Sarah and Abraham Sarah tried to interpret God's word and give agar you know and and that made the problem it must be Abraham and Isaac through Sarah no matter what it is right so it must be Bathsheba Solomon and David no matter what right but David was there in the wrong time right right simply because he was not in the right place if only I believe if only David went ahead or went just just the way it was designed when kings go for it for battle amen somewhere along the way something could have happened to Uriah it would happen somehow because it was God's predestinated for Solomon to be the son of David Hallelujah but it happened though because David wasn't there and he went ahead of God's timing to Bathsheba right you know God's never late even when you know he we were talking about him and myself you know we're talking about you know uh uh uh he was in late four days when when he was there in front of the tomb of Lazarus that was the time right that he designed that will give him glory amen so David use his own time and that made all the problems he was in in the wrong place at the wrong time Hallelujah so we cannot go ahead of God neither we can be late and if we are always you know people they just go ahead so much amen but sometimes people get too late amen sometimes you know we're supposed to be there and sometimes we just keep waiting because we do not want to take the risk you know you know we do not want to make mistakes somehow amen and and gets a little delay amen but I believe if we put these things two things together too late and too Advance there is always middle of the road if we can put these two things together and go right there at the middle of the road then we got started amen and we can we can aim amen our rifle to the Target and pull the trigger and here Satan bullseye amen because we are in God's timing that's the main thing that's the main thing that happened to David and you see in another statement let us read this I believe this is in the third code brother he said in the message Elijah in 1953 I said God loved Israel and said so in the Bible and he never did say that he loved us in that way when I said that was his first love was Israel and yet when Israel got out of the will of God God poured out the judgments of Heaven upon Israel and we will not escape the judgments of God if David was a man after God's Own Heart and when David sinned before God God made David reap for what he sold and we will never come short of that right right whether it's individual Church community or a nation like America right exactly where are we at now amen your nation started Detroit you know you know your history more than I know it amen but look where it's at now so that the prophet of God said whether it's an individual like David like me like you amen a church when he left its first love yeah a community a nation like America like the Philippines God will require Judgment of sin Hallelujah you know what the Philippines we have we we made I would consider the greatest decision in our history some of you may have not known it but you see during the time when Israel was was supposed to be voted as a nation amen sometime during that year the Secretary General of the U.N happened to be Carlos P romulo who was beside general makhartur you know when General MacArthur fulfilled his premise to the Philippines that famous statement I shall return Carlos piromulo was with him and and he he's among uh uh the the the the the the brightest uh uh uh men that our country have braced and he became the Secretary General to the U.N and at that time all the members of un should decide whether Israel must be accepted as a nation amen and you know what have happened there was a tie the score on both sides were the same and only at that particular incident the Secretary General has to vote and their stood Carlos piromolo the Filipino representative who happened to be the Secretary General and our president you know he he called the president and he they had the same decision vote for Israel so we broke the tie amen and you know just immediately after that the Philippines was blessed it even happened to be our nation became number one in Southeast Asia in terms of economy amen because after the war Japan used to be number one but after the war you know everything gone and we became number one but shortly after that the Philippines little by little little by little because we are a Catholic nation and so forth and so on you know now we are you know I'm a Filipino brother Branham said no matter what I'm an American so you see no matter what I'm a Filipino somehow but I have the greatest citizenship and I'm citizen of Heaven I believe hallelujah amen but you see amen that's why brother Benham said whether it's an individual Church community or a nation God will require Judgment of sin right amen that have happened to to David and what I'm pointing out brothers and sisters is that we need all the time by God's grace and health to be right on our post of Duty when you find your position in the body of Christ it's more than 100 cups of ice cream right right and for me I can testify I love his word I love this message and we should only have to do what we are supposed to do not just recognizing our post of Duty but to be an active living part of the body of Jesus Christ the function amen because it takes amen a deposition amen when we recognize our position responsibility comes after which there's always a responsibility in our post of Duty it's not just a position you know it's good to be called the pastor evangelist missionaries somehow it's good amen but the function the responsibility behind it is the most important thing and and in that unguarded moment David failed Amen to be in his rightful post of Duty amen fulfilling His function as uh as the king amen because during the time that the king should go forth into battle and see all these things have happened Hallelujah so it's always my prayers brothers and sisters amen that in every moment of Our Lives amen we should be in our right post objects that when he comes back and I believe all this thing all these things that are happening around us amen the prophet of God said all these things there is only one thing that the bread of Jesus Christ is waiting for and that's the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and that's the body change amen it's not anything that this world can offer we're still working we're still feeding providing our as fathers we need to provide for our families amen us you know as as students you know it's not bad to have ambition of some sort amen but make sure amen anything you know if you want to prepare better balance if you want to prepare something for your life 10 years 20 years or even 100 years amen but make sure whenever he comes you are prepared glory and when he comes we are on our rightful post of June right Hallelujah so we have placed amen this message has placed us so much that's why we believe that this message will not make us Sons and Daughters of God amen because in the mind of God we were already we were already in his mind amen this message only amen gives us the revelation of Who We Are amen there's nothing added to it all right Amen in Jeremiah chapter 29 says I know the thought for I know the thoughts that I think toward you and these thoughts are good amen not of evil right all right amen and he said he gives us an expected end amen amen and this is only for his own Glory and I thank God for that in my life you know there's a lot of things also that have happened all of us have our own testimonies before we came back to the Lord and the Lord starts Our Lives you know all of us have something to tell right we have entered in that verse two of second Samuel amen when we are where we are supposed to be in verse 29. amen but we experience verse 2 of chapter 11 until verse 28 of chapter 12 of David's life right Hallelujah but praise God Amen well when we go when we go under the blood anytime this you know uh Satan will always uh point us to that part of our Lives amen but every time he looks and open it because of the blood there's no record on file Hallelujah there's no record on file amen David remains to be the the man after God's Own Heart I remain to be the son of God amen and and these and this does not give me a a license you know to get to get to go out of the way you know but this only gives me liberty to ponder and to appreciate the grace of the Lord you see when we come to the full revelation of the grace of God Amen we will not go beyond what we are supposed to do amen as much as possible we will stay in our post of Duty because we recognize God Amen brother was confronted with question you know between between this Armenian and calvinistic jury you know where you know we're saved by works and we're saved by grace somehow amen remember there is middle of the road you know it does not mean that we're not working because we recognize the grace of God but the only thing is we don't believe that by doing good works we're saved right amen but the message of the hour even gives us enough Revelation about God's grace in fact it is beyond our understanding but as much as we can understand at least amen we we we have come to a point Amen to appreciate God's Amazing Grace and because of this that puts us to do good works not to be saved but we do that in gratitude because we are grateful we are grateful for what God has done for us Hallelujah and that puts us to work amen Hallelujah and so you know this message plays Us in such a position and now as I have said you know people somehow you know they just went ahead and some are too late to fulfill God's word yeah yeah that's why brother the scripture says you know when when you hear his voice heard the natural hearts amen so the moment the opportunity is there and we know that it is the will of the Lord don't let it pass by otherwise it will go into some other's hand Hallelujah because God will fulfill his own word no matter what it will fulfill that's why all these things you know the permissive will we recognize is the permissive but the perfect will of the Lord overruled all the permissive will that have happened to David the same thing with me the same thing with you and me hallelujah thank you Lord I love him so much the more I the more I serve him the more I love him so in Psalms 51 let us just read this in verse 7 let's let's proceed Purge me with his up and I shall be clean wash me and I shall be whiter than snow make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou has broken May rejoice right huh right amen so sometimes God has to break our bones you know sometimes we enjoy too much and we forget him we take risk in leaving our position and try something else amen and God Amen sometimes we go too far and guide us to break our bones it hurts God to break us amen but that's the only way to bring us back to himself right and he said you know amen and that's why now David said uh uh make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones with thou has broken May Rejoice hide thy face from my sins and black out all my iniquities creating me a clean heart o God and renew it's not a new it is a renew renew a right Spirit Within Me cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy Holy Spirit from me restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit then now this is a testimony now we recognize why God has to allow these things amen because when David recognized and was able to was for God to restore him and in verse 13 He said then will I teach transgressors thy ways you know sometimes it's good that there are people who went ahead of us and share experiences amen that somehow we cannot go we should not go their way because they have tried it already and this is what I can advise to the young people that are here listen to the elders because they have passed those ways already right don't ever try amen it's just good you know that God you know like Joseph was was being preserved amen and and so and so restaurant to me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy Prince Spirit then will I teach transgressors thy ways and sinners shall be converted unto thee amen so now David becomes a testimony right and he could win souls and give good advice amen so now it's on in in occupying our position because we recognize our function their God will bless us amen right right and now we are already in the position all the scriptures all the prophecies have been fulfilled that's why he said you know because in this days you know there's a lot of things that are going on even in those people that used to be so cold believing the message amen before believing the sign but now they disbelieve the sign right amen so I would say the battle is on amen because there is already a falling away that's going on and it has been prophesied already amen so people are you know just uh you know in the Philippines we I know it's all over the world you know this is strange doctrines that are going around you know that they believe that they're already in the uh in the Millennium some already in the eighth day uh enjoying eternity and you know the the spiritual application of those things amen but we believe I believe personally that there are natural fulfillment of these things there has to be a a literal Rapture that will take place a body chain somehow amen but there are people who believe that they're already enjoying eternity but I just wondered how how how how how they're not they could not enter the zoo in a fellowship with the lions and tigers over there amen for me they're too advanced that's too advanced amen but then there are also people that always look back amen that the only thing that they could say that all the things I mean I'm not saying against it amen I really appreciate that the only thing they could that they could Rejoice are the things that have happened in the ministry of brother Branham amen I believe all those things are true all those things are testimony amen but for me that's too late right right I mean it's good to Pander on those things proving that God is alive amen but listen Elijah said to Elisha I want Elisha said I want double portion of what you have right and Elijah said Elijah if thou see me go right then ye shall receive what you ask for amen now we have seen the Prophet come but we should accept the fact that he's gone right right but that does not make us unbeliever Amen in fact amen he has introduced us to Christ and the message that he has brought and that's why I'm still quoting his message because this is Christ in word form amen Hallelujah so so these people and yet people are too late and then they they instead of now they're on the other side that instead of pandering and enjoying this testimonies they criticize it you know criticizing the cloud Chris is decising the prophet and all this stuff for me that is too late also it's too late for me yeah yeah amen now what would Rebecca say you know what would Rebecca say if his neighbor would tell amen do you believe that Elisa you know that ilyaser we know him he made a lot of statements that we don't we don't believe what would Rebecca say well I don't care yeah all I know is that Elisa introduced me to Isaac and now I'm married to Isaac oh yeah so Rebecca will say you're too late buddy so if you say anything against my prophet he means to be my Prophet then I would say you're too late amen so you're too late it's either you're too late and you're too ahead amen but I am in the middle of the road I'm in God's timing Hallelujah and God is fulfilling his word in our midst and I what and I only do amen is to just enjoy where God placed me amen and enjoy it and live the way I should be and conduct myself as the son of the king Hallelujah but we are in the battle we were made Kings and Priests and if we were made Kings and Priests then this is our time this is the time you know just like in a ball game you know we're we're the best players are being placed right and this is the same time the kings that were made you know should be in the Battlefront that's why when brother Branham was there in the mountain and when he raised his hand he was given the sword the king of the the king's sword amen why you know he was not given anything else he was not given something he was given the king's sword and that sword you know when you have the sword in your hand you know you better prepare for battle right you're not in the party we're not on a holiday we're not an Excursion we're in a battle every day of Our Lives by receiving this message amen because we know the moment we receive this message all hell is up against us Hallelujah and so it's better all the time to be right in our rightful position thank you Lord hallelujah and God will never fail God will never fail and every time you know every time there is there is a meeting if we're going to meet him up there in the air every time you know Abraham overcame the Kings during the time of lot and after who overcame Kings he met Melchizedek and after we have fought our fight in this day because this is the King's battle and I believe the king of all Kings is here in Armenia Hallelujah I remember those those those archangels you know and there was a conference in heaven and they would look down and see what's going on in Babylon and these three young people stood their ground and they want the king wanted them to to bow down you know so these three young people were up against the king of Babylon Hallelujah they were up against the king but they stood their ground and so because they stood their ground now notice when we stood our ground amen you know it's there's there's just holes of angels not just friends that will be around us when we are in the midst of our own battle amen because the king is on our side remember it's not just us fighting our battle right because we are fighting against King this is Satan's kingdom and we're fighting against the king of this Eden and so these three young people they were they they they stood against the king of Babylon and so because of that amen it only created not only their friends Amen to to be around them but there is something a conference that have happened in heaven and God was there looking down and the archangels where they're looking down below said I could imagine how you know how wormwood amen could could pull that that sword and said Lord I cannot stand it anymore amen can you can you send me once again as you send me during the time of Noah where I sent flood I can I can do it once again at your at your at your instruction and I can change this in right now amen and the King said I really appreciate your concern to my children wormwood but this is not your battle amen sit down amen and then Gabriel also appealed to the Lord Lord send me now if it's not wormwood maybe me amen and the King said I appreciate that but you better sit beside wormwood and probably Michael also amen but he said I appreciate all your concern upon my people but they're fighting against the king of Babylon and so I need to come down and so that poor man in the Perry furnace was the king himself Hallelujah why because we are during the time that this is the fight when kings go for battle and I believe that Ancient of Days come down the king of glory has come down Hallelujah to pie this kind of battle and there's no way we're going to lose as long as we are in our rightful position Hallelujah and we just depend upon Him upon upon himself and we should always look at that portion you know that that we are always amen under the inspiration of this holy word you know so you see you're just right here you pray for us yeah when we are on the field we do our position we fulfill our own objective and that is for soul amen so this message just like brother Branham just like I said you know it's good to talk about those things that have happened but God I believe is placing us in our rightful position I remember one time when brother Branham of course we remember Sister Haiti right so much when brother Branham was just right there and God was pleased because this woman said the right thing upon the prophet just like what David said he he respected Nathan and here comes the bride Here Comes Haiti right to a great respect with the prophet of God he said the right thing and in that very hour there was a voice and brother Branham testified that as clear as I heard those voice when those squirrels appear when the resurrection of that fish that was the same similar voice that I heard that said tell that woman whatever she says it will come to pass now I believe you know it is somehow a a a type we can we can bring it wider in such a view that God is placing Us in such a position that the prophet of God is speaking to the bride to speak the word because the bride has the spoken word amen and so in that rightful position with the right character amen God has pulled trust in that woman right right that that he can speak to his prophet and give that message that whatever this woman say it will come to pass amen remember in the mind in the mind of the prophet he he had so much compassion about about this woman she was so poor and she had the sick loved one it's in the mind of the Prophet she might have chosen either one amen but you see the bride that with the woman with the right character with the right Pure Heart Right and the Bible said I'll of the abundance of your heart right our hearts speak so it see it it just came natural and he said this woman said I don't know what to say what will I say what will I ask and the prophet of God said whatever and out of the abundance of the word is spoke and she said the Salvation Glory the souls oh my voice and that's and that's you know that's the condition of the bride's heart we always have passion for Souls amen and God will not back out back off from his word and the way as the bride said it came to pass so I believe we look beyond that that now the bride amen is just knocking right there on the door amen the potential is here available in our midst and this is not this message is not just talking about the prophet right this is talking about the word in the mind that's our rightful position we're in the battle amen and so with that kind of compassion now let me read that last quotation I will close from this Amen in the message Victory Day he said look at Dwight Moody's conversion and many of those you see just one little old woman little old wash woman with a message on her heart amen is that what you have in your heart this morning with a message on her heart to do something for God and she rented an old library stable and got a minister to come down and preach and nobody but a little old boy with their hair hanging down his neck and his daddy suspenders on went down there and knelt down up the altar that night Dwight Moody that sent a half a million souls to Jesus Christ see that woman had something to do and I couldn't say this morning this woman amen has something to do it was for a purpose right she was made a was woman for a purpose let me tell you who you are this morning your teacher your janitor driver contractor whoever you are this morning amen I take this word upon myself I was made as a pastor as a missionary for a purpose and you can claim this scripture to be yours this verse to be yours we were made what we are for a purpose and don't despise to where God has got you but serve your purpose don't leave that position Hallelujah this coming a great Victory Day one of these days where the battle is over here hallelujah we love you we always pray for you
