[27:12] foreign
[27:15] [Music]
[27:31] [Music]
[27:42] [Applause]
[27:45] [Music]
[27:53] Lord
[27:55] I want to see you
[27:59] good job brother appreciate you
[28:08] shining in the light of your glory
[28:14] pour out your power and love as we sing

[28:45] Holy Holy holy holy
[28:49] you love him today
[28:53] holy holy holy Lord
[28:59] holy holy holy Lord
[29:05] holy holy holy
[29:09] I want to
[29:12] see here
[29:16] high and lifted up
[29:18] when I think about that you know what I
[29:20] think about
[29:21] they hoisted my God up on a tree one
[29:24] time
[29:28] as an offering for me and you
[29:31] he had to be high and lifted up
[29:34] he had to be lifted up between Heaven
[29:35] and Earth
[29:38] I love what brother Brown said Heaven
[29:39] didn't want him
[29:41] Earth didn't want him
[29:43] so he hung Between Heaven and Earth
[29:46] he couldn't go back to Heaven because he
[29:47] had our sins on him
[29:49] couldn't come back to earth because we
[29:51] couldn't have died for sin but he died
[29:53] Between Heaven and Earth
[29:54] so when I that song means a lot more
[29:58] than just
[30:00] than just a song it's high and lifted up
[30:05] those priests didn't know what they were
[30:07] doing when they were taking that
[30:08] offering and they would wave it
[30:11] and then there would be a heave offering
[30:13] where they'd raise it up and down the
[30:15] sign of the cross
[30:16] knowing that they would have to heave
[30:18] the Lamb of God
[30:20] up off of the Earth
[30:22] so that he can hang Between Heaven and
[30:24] Earth and take mine in your sins
[30:27] and be able now now we can enter in to
[30:31] the holy of holies now we can enter into
[30:33] heaven with no sin because he took our
[30:36] sin he became sin that we could be what
[30:38] righteousness
[30:40] and that's what we're looking today we
[30:41] want to further go further than just uh
[30:45] brother Josh Bennett last night or not
[30:46] before last one whenever he was
[30:48] preaching he was speaking on in other
[30:52] words
[30:53] I've been baptized now what
[30:55] going Beyond water baptism because we
[30:58] love to get everybody baptized and like
[30:59] I said we got all these people baptized
[31:01] that's fine but we got to go that's just
[31:03] the beginning that's just the start
[31:05] that's just down at the bottom that

[31:08] way down below there under the
[31:10] foundation all right but what are we
[31:12] going to do we're going to keep going on
[31:14] we're going to strive and push and pull
[31:16] and brother Ernie used to say well if we
[31:20] don't have no teeth we'll gum the devil
[31:21] to death we'll hack him we'll strike him
[31:23] we'll hit him we'll do whatever we can

[34:51] one that as we study and and look at

[35:29] Lord we need you father be with the
[35:31] missionaries Lord and the different ones
[35:32] that are doing their work Lord in the
[35:33] Philippines Jamaica in different places

[35:37] think of them often and we pray Lord
[35:39] that you will just be with them
[35:41] continually just bless us now and take
[35:43] care of us in Jesus name amen you saw
[35:46] that my sister Chichi she was almost
[35:48] it was almost underwater there at her
[35:50] house because of the rain and typhoons
[35:53] but the rain stopped
[35:55] rain stopped before it got to your house
[35:57] rain stopped
[36:01] when the bride goes to praying let me
[36:03] tell you something demons start going
[36:04] they going wild hold on hold on hold on
[36:07] what's going on here we never felt this
[36:09] kind of power before that's the power
[36:11] that you and I have on the face of this
[36:13] Earth today as the Bride of Jesus Christ
[36:15] there has not been with there's no one
[36:17] has has worked under an open book you
[36:19] and I work under an open book
[36:22] yeah not closed it's an open book and
[36:25] anything any promise in this Bible is
[36:28] what available to the bride now man it's
[36:30] available to each one of us so let's
[36:33] start here just a little bit more of
[36:34] what we were doing this morning and
[36:36] we'll talk a little bit about memories
[36:37] and conscious effects and Imagination
[36:39] because that's where the devil plays and
[36:41] that's where God actually does his work
[36:44] also
[36:45] so let's read here in the beginning was
[36:46] the word and where it was with God and
[36:48] the Word was God and the Word was made
[36:50] flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld
[36:52] his glory the glory the only begotten of
[36:54] the father full of grace and truth as we
[36:55] were talking about this morning you are
[36:57] his glory
[36:59] in other words you are what remember he
[37:01] was he was in John was on the Isle of
[37:04] Patmos he looked over in Book of
[37:05] Revelations he heard the voice he had
[37:08] heard that voice on Earth he knew it was
[37:10] the Lord Jesus but it was surprised when
[37:12] he turned and looked and there was the
[37:14] son of man gird about the paths with a
[37:16] golden girdle in Bride form all right
[37:18] and then John gets over into Revelation
[37:20] he said man there's bride everywhere he
[37:22] said there's Revelations 19. we got
[37:24] people coming back then over here in
[37:25] Revelations 21 or 22 when the city comes
[37:28] down and it looks like the bride the
[37:29] bride's just everywhere and the bride is
[37:31] the whole like brother Dale's always
[37:32] said the bride's book is a book of
[37:34] Revelations because it tells about us
[37:36] and our walk in life and our journey how
[37:38] we got here how what we're doing while
[37:40] we're here and when we're going home and
[37:42] the future home that we're going to be
[37:43] in
[37:44] so behold in glory the glory the only
[37:46] begotten of the father full of grace and
[37:48] truth now listen let me tell you
[37:50] something let's talk about this other
[37:51] day if God said this
[37:53] you're going to be his glory you're
[37:55] going to be his victory he's got to make
[37:57] a way that somebody does it
[37:59] all right so he's going to make a way he
[38:02] saw somebody by foreknowledge he saw
[38:04] somebody do exactly what he said and
[38:07] they made it amen amen so therefore
[38:09] somebody's going to make it you can't
[38:10] say you can't say well I can't do that
[38:13] well you're the only one stopping you
[38:15] all right so first Thessalonians 4 says
[38:18] every one of you should know how to
[38:20] possess this vessel and sanctification
[38:21] and honor you know as we go through this
[38:24] statue of perfect man when we get into
[38:25] the virtues I want you to be able to
[38:27] when you go into your life lesson which
[38:30] starts on Monday for those of us that
[38:32] work your life your life lesson starts
[38:34] on Monday and continues on through until
[38:36] the next week and
[38:39] that you can say man that used to bother
[38:41] me but that don't bother me anymore
[38:43] that used to hurt my feelings but
[38:45] that'll hurt my feelings anymore I used
[38:47] to handle it this way but now I handle
[38:49] it this way to me that's the renewing of
[38:51] your mind that's the changing of what
[38:53] you were doing and listen what you've
[38:55] done all your life right man
[38:58] that's right I'm 62 there's things I've
[39:00] done for at least 50 years that I'm not
[39:03] proud of
[39:04] and they don't some of them don't bother
[39:06] me sister Anna and then the only thing
[39:08] that's bothering me is you know you get
[39:09] then your body starts bothering you you
[39:11] know somebody told me one time as you
[39:12] get older you only worry about one thing
[39:14] I said what's that he said survival
[39:16] [Laughter]
[39:20] don't worry about
[39:21] it what do you worry about worry about
[39:23] surviving
[39:24] all right as we get older that's and
[39:26] that's just the way it is so listen and
[39:27] that's what we got to worry about now
[39:28] surviving surviving this world
[39:31] surviving this age listen even though we
[39:34] got the open book it's the darkest age
[39:36] it ever was right
[39:37] there's never been the highest power of
[39:40] demons on earth now listen I just told
[39:43] you that the highest power of of the
[39:45] Bride is on the Earth today
[39:47] but there's got to be a someone to
[39:49] combat
[39:50] that's where that greatest battle is
[39:52] because remember it's two it's too fat
[39:54] battling like this and what whichever we
[39:57] feed
[39:58] is the one that wins be not conform to
[40:00] this world but be transformed by the
[40:02] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[40:03] you may prove what is that good and
[40:06] acceptable and perfect will of God you
[40:08] may be said what is the will of God it's
[40:09] his word so we're going to produce the
[40:13] word of God but we're not going to
[40:14] produce it on paper we're going to
[40:15] produce it in human flesh all right now
[40:18] that's his that's his
[40:20] John 1 1 I just read it John 1 14.
[40:25] in the beginning was the word words with
[40:27] God's word was God and that word was
[40:29] made flesh
[40:31] and dwelt among us all right so the
[40:33] first thing we got to do over and over
[40:35] again I want you to know that we got to
[40:36] be born again if you're not born again
[40:38] remember what was it this morning that
[40:40] fountain that is that is Flowing out of
[40:42] your soul is bitter
[40:45] if you're not born again there's not a
[40:48] trickle of this and a trickle of that
[40:50] and and you've got this
[40:52] see down inside of you that's trying to
[40:54] you're lost
[40:57] I'll read you a quote here in a few
[40:58] minutes brother Brown said you were born
[41:00] in this world a sinner
[41:02] lost
[41:04] he said with no hope
[41:08] with no hope
[41:09] so let's just keep it that way I like it
[41:11] like that that way I know I was lost and
[41:14] now I'm found
[41:15] that way I know I had no choice in this
[41:18] at all as far as what I saw
[41:22] but I did have a choice but I made that
[41:25] choice for the foundation of the world
[41:27] God saw me make that choice and he knew
[41:30] and had it what
[41:32] I think I got to hear her back there
[41:34] brother Brown said before the world was
[41:36] formed this Bible was written exactly as
[41:40] it's written today
[41:42] because how can you change the word of
[41:44] God you can't change the word of God
[41:46] once it's written it's forever written
[41:48] in heaven and it was in the mind of God
[41:50] exactly Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph us
[41:54] John
[41:55] Paul P all that was already four new by
[41:59] God and by foreknowledge he knew exactly
[42:02] what we would do and then what do we do
[42:05] in Ephesians 4 11 he would send us a
[42:08] FireFold Ministry he would send us a way
[42:11] to get this not get it by herself but a
[42:14] way to get it what through human beings
[42:17] because the seed life comes through the
[42:19] body all right because what does the
[42:22] seed if you've got the seed life inside
[42:24] of you you can give it out that's what
[42:26] we're talking about virtue you can't
[42:27] give that kind of Godly virtue if you
[42:29] don't have it already inside of you
[42:32] all right can't because remember it's
[42:35] like you trying to manufacture something
[42:37] the the black birds sticking the peacock
[42:39] feathers in you know or or the wolf and
[42:42] sheep's clothing you're going to
[42:43] manifest being a a sheep or a goat one
[42:46] of the two or a wolf
[42:48] you might fool somebody sometime but
[42:50] you're not gonna feel fool God ever
[42:52] ever gonna fool God all right
[42:59] so right here's where we're at today
[43:01] we're born again we're coming up to a
[43:03] place to where now we realize we need
[43:06] these virtues in our life we need this
[43:09] to do one thing and that show Christ you
[43:12] don't want to show yourself you don't
[43:14] want to show the preacher you want to
[43:15] show Christ in you because remember in
[43:18] the book of Ephesus when you sell the
[43:21] Bible says they were called First Call
[43:22] Christians because they acted like
[43:23] Christ he didn't talk about Paul it
[43:26] talks about the church at Ephesus the
[43:28] church folks the church people were
[43:31] acting like Christ so they were called
[43:33] Christians in Antioch I believe and not
[43:34] Ephesians but Antioch he would call
[43:36] Christians in Antioch because they act
[43:38] like Christ right that's what we want to
[43:40] be affiliated with because remember
[43:43] um when you look at Christianity out in
[43:46] the world
[43:47] I mean it just has no moral it just has
[43:49] no it has no standard you can do pretty
[43:52] much whatever you want to do we were
[43:54] driving by a few minutes or this morning
[43:56] and one of the churches there on on the
[43:58] road coming up here the the girls were
[44:00] walking out of the uh Fellowship Halls
[44:02] away from the church and here they come
[44:04] out and one girl had like spandex
[44:07] um
[44:08] workout drawers pants on whatever you
[44:10] try to call and she was heading toward
[44:12] Church she wasn't going to the she went
[44:15] she wasn't going to the to the workout
[44:17] place she was going to church and it
[44:19] looked like she had just got up out of
[44:21] the bed and went to church
[44:23] so there's no standard you and I have a
[44:25] standard listen God's not obligated to
[44:28] work through that
[44:30] but he is obligated to work through this
[44:32] if we live the right life he's
[44:34] absolutely obligated to what his word
[44:38] all right we fail miserably but folks we
[44:41] we know there's one thing for sure they
[44:44] don't have what we got
[44:46] right and I don't separate them they're
[44:48] separating theirself
[44:49] and God said separate yourself from that
[44:53] right now listen he called them
[44:59] he didn't have a problem calling them
[45:00] and prostitutes
[45:02] amen
[45:05] so we shouldn't have a problem calling
[45:06] him that either no not to people the
[45:09] system
[45:11] love the sinner hate the sin
[45:14] all right
[45:15] but that thing's wrong that is a
[45:18] prostitute system working outside of
[45:21] this message of the hour the true
[45:23] message of the hour the True born-again
[45:25] Believer the true people that have
[45:26] messed I'm sorry
[45:28] they are in a prostitute system that's
[45:30] what the Bible says
[45:32] the great
[45:34] and her daughters all right so everybody
[45:37] with me on that I'm not talking about
[45:39] the people but but if they're caught in
[45:41] that system what are they
[45:42] right they're that system
[45:45] it takes people to make that work
[45:47] but what it does it took somebody to
[45:49] stand in the pulpit and say oh honey
[45:51] it's okay you can wear what you want to
[45:53] wear to church Come As You Are
[45:55] that's all right you can come as you are
[45:57] one time maybe twice
[46:00] but you'll never come back here
[46:02] if you get something
[46:04] you'll be changed
[46:06] you'll be able to walk and drive down
[46:09] the road and look at us standing outside
[46:11] and see a different set of people
[46:15] just by what we're wearing just by why
[46:17] we're not over there smoking in the wind
[46:19] got a smoking section over here in the
[46:20] parking lot for the for the Baptists
[46:23] that smoke they talk about the methods
[46:24] that drink and the methods talk about
[46:25] them to smoke so
[46:27] here we go
[46:29] but thank God for the truth
[46:31] I thank God for the truth not that I'm
[46:33] not that I stand up like the Pharisee
[46:35] don't ever stand up and say I'm glad I'm
[46:37] not like that person no I say Lord
[46:39] without you I'd be that person
[46:41] without you I'd be in that system out
[46:43] there listen without God I wouldn't be
[46:45] in that system
[46:47] I'd be in the devil system way out you
[46:50] under somewhere with no religion at all
[46:52] right and so would some of us yeah
[46:55] yeah then we talk about we talked about
[46:57] the Paradox I still enjoy about the what
[47:00] brother Brown was talking about this
[47:01] he's talking about the stand a decision
[47:04] you know it all works together for the
[47:06] good way you do it never heard them at
[47:07] least him in other words the fiery
[47:09] trials we have to go through the fiery
[47:10] furnace at the three Hebrew children
[47:12] went through they thought they were
[47:14] going to die actually it loosed them
[47:16] from what they were
[47:18] they were prisoners to What A system
[47:20] that said you've got to stand and bow to
[47:23] this image which is your friend they
[47:26] thought I mean the King Nebuchadnezzar
[47:27] probably when he said that he said I'll
[47:29] throw them in the fire remember then
[47:32] then he comes up one day and he gets all
[47:34] mad he says if they don't if if you
[47:36] catch them worshiping God then then put
[47:39] them in the Lion's Den well the first
[47:41] person that went was his friend Daniel
[47:43] Daniel had interpreted his dreams and
[47:45] he'd give him up you know Daniel was a
[47:48] he was a good man in the community
[47:51] but the king couldn't take back what he
[47:53] said either
[47:55] so he thought Daniel wasn't going to do
[47:57] that but Daniel did he remember he threw
[47:58] the his brother Brown said he threw them
[48:00] he didn't just barely crack the windows
[48:03] he threw him open and he worshiped
[48:05] toward what the temple there where
[48:09] where the worshiper was supposed to go
[48:12] and he couldn't get there because
[48:13] remember he's in captivity all right but
[48:15] he still worshiped listen even in
[48:17] captivity they should worship God so
[48:18] even in our captivity we should be able
[48:20] to worship God Amen and spirit and Truth
[48:24] all right listen Last Story brother
[48:26] random talks about committing committing
[48:27] it to him the greatest weapon that an
[48:29] old Christian needs today or uses today
[48:32] is a committal to God committed to God
[48:35] don't try to give it to me and God
[48:38] give it to God
[48:40] when you can't do nothing about it just
[48:42] commit it to him and God will take care
[48:43] of it now listen as human beings that's
[48:45] at least one of the hardest things
[48:47] you'll ever do
[48:49] is take somebody you love with all your
[48:51] heart and commit them to God
[48:53] and then take your hands completely off
[48:55] of them and whatever happens happens as
[48:58] we were talking about this morning
[49:01] if your kids get sick
[49:02] it's hard not to pray for them but what
[49:04] if God put that on them
[49:06] what if God did that but if he put it on
[49:09] to drive him back and here we're trying
[49:10] to pray for him to get it off of them
[49:13] so the best thing to do is say God save
[49:16] their soul
[49:17] save their soul
[49:19] I want that listen I want their soul to
[49:21] walk in this door I don't want just a
[49:23] person I want their soul to walk you I
[49:25] want that soul to say I need to go I
[49:29] need to change because that's where it's
[49:31] going to what if they walk in here with
[49:34] just the same old bitter Fountain
[49:37] right no you wanted to come in here
[49:40] wanting something you know what they
[49:42] want your fountain man I hope
[49:47] I remember the greatest battle ever
[49:49] fought we know where it's at and it's
[49:50] ready to go into action
[49:51] God's been selecting his soldiers listen
[49:54] this battle
[49:56] the battle between Satan and death has
[49:59] never been won before
[50:03] oh don't get quiet on me now
[50:05] Jesus died
[50:08] he died for me and you but he died
[50:12] a human death
[50:14] but you and I've got to come to a place
[50:16] that we don't die human death
[50:18] matter
[50:19] yeah
[50:22] listen I was thinking back there a few
[50:23] minutes ago
[50:25] we talk about defeating Satan the only
[50:27] time Satan is going to be truly totally
[50:29] defeated is when he's thrown into the
[50:32] into the Lake of Fire
[50:34] but he's getting a temporary beaten
[50:38] right now
[50:40] because we're going to beat him so bad
[50:41] in the Millennium till he ain't gonna
[50:43] have nothing he's going to be like
[50:44] somebody that's walking around trying to
[50:46] find somebody to work through
[50:48] I can't find this one man what what
[50:50] what do you mean because remember Satan
[50:52] is not thrown in a pit like this and
[50:54] he's going to be there for a thousand
[50:55] years now I believe he's going to be
[50:57] there he's going to be somewhere
[50:58] he's just going to be held back by what
[51:01] a chain of circumstances the prophet
[51:03] said
[51:04] and who is that circumstances
[51:06] me and you
[51:08] you and I are the circumstance he can't
[51:10] work through
[51:11] man amen but now right now today as you
[51:14] said today and as I stand here today he
[51:16] is working
[51:19] he's full well on the job at the moment
[51:22] all right but when we get into
[51:24] Millennium we're going to have a body
[51:25] change so what we're gonna we're gonna
[51:27] take and we're gonna preempt that
[51:30] we know the show and the stage is set
[51:32] for the Millennium where he'll be
[51:34] Chained and and you know not be he'll be
[51:37] bound for a thousand years and not be
[51:38] able to work in US
[51:40] but Folks at the body change
[51:43] he's going to be bound
[51:45] by us
[51:47] and not be able to work in us anymore
[51:49] the reason he's working now is because
[51:51] there's death still warring in our
[51:54] members as Paul said all right things I
[51:56] would not I do things I do it was not
[51:58] Paul Paul had the same thing about you
[51:59] same thing with me and you going up
[52:01] tattoo perfect man that's the same they
[52:03] had the same problems
[52:04] things I would not I do things I do not
[52:06] I would what was warring
[52:10] his his soul was the if anybody was born
[52:13] again Paul was born again he wrote half
[52:15] the Bible or more than half of the New
[52:18] Testament so he had to have the new
[52:19] birth everybody with me
[52:21] all right but he still had problems
[52:24] he was a first church-aged messenger he
[52:26] was a prophet
[52:28] and he still had problems the things I
[52:30] would not I do things I do not I would
[52:33] there's a thing warring in my members
[52:35] Paul listen Paul didn't have that
[52:38] problem when he was persecuting
[52:39] Christians right
[52:40] that's right no he just said ah and he
[52:44] was zealous in what he was doing wasn't
[52:47] just Paul going I think I'll get two
[52:49] three today no he went after the whole
[52:51] church
[52:53] if I didn't get the whole church he's
[52:55] figured he didn't have a good day that's
[52:57] how zealous Paul was to get them people
[52:59] out of there oh they're worshiping some
[53:02] false god and they think Jesus was if
[53:05] all they just told me he was some old
[53:07] some old guy you know that they followed
[53:10] and now he's dead
[53:13] boy did he have a rude awakening
[53:16] did he not have not have variance in
[53:18] that
[53:19] day when God himself knocked him off of
[53:22] that horse and said Paul
[53:25] I'm Jesus who you persecute
[53:29] and he's like man I'm done for her
[53:32] Jesus said no
[53:34] I did this
[53:36] because you're my first church age
[53:37] messenger he didn't know that but that's
[53:40] what God said you're my first church
[53:41] ain't messing you're going to get this
[53:42] thing started and you're going to save
[53:45] more people than you put in prison
[53:49] listen Paul's words are still saving
[53:51] people now
[53:52] that's Paul's Doctrine he said you'll be
[53:55] judged by my doctrine that was Paul's
[53:58] Doctrine and that's how we get saved by
[54:00] that Doctrine yes so he's still getting
[54:02] people saved that's how good a church
[54:04] age Mastery was but Jesus said listen
[54:07] you know Jesus is standing there one day
[54:09] and in eternity and he's going
[54:12] if he can do that for the devil
[54:15] you know this just be me and you if he
[54:17] could do that for the devil think what
[54:18] he can do for me
[54:20] think what he can do for me if I just
[54:22] change him a little bit knock him off
[54:23] his horse he got knocked off his high
[54:25] horse
[54:26] amen have you ever been knocked off your
[54:28] high horse it's not a real soft Landing
[54:32] I'll promise you that no you're gonna
[54:34] hurt for days
[54:36] but that's all right thank God at least
[54:37] God's want to knock you off the horse
[54:39] not the devil amen so I believe he's
[54:43] dressing he's dressing us now he's
[54:44] training us what he's training us how to
[54:48] take care of this life
[54:51] that we're living right now
[54:52] not past life
[54:56] this life
[54:57] this life right here the life that I now
[55:00] live Paul said I live by the faith of
[55:03] the son of God
[55:05] right now
[55:06] so he's dressing and training us the
[55:08] Battlefront is set knew where it is then
[55:10] the mind we know that
[55:11] it's the greatest battle ever fought
[55:14] it begins in the human mind and that's
[55:16] where the battle starts the human mind
[55:18] was chosen for the excuse me the place
[55:20] of battle where it was beginning it's
[55:23] because that decisions are made from the
[55:25] mind we'll get into that just a minute
[55:26] with memory region and conscious effects
[55:28] and Imagination then we there's the
[55:30] quote that we read every time we're
[55:31] going to read it again listen you have
[55:33] to suffer to rain
[55:34] this is not a picnic
[55:36] he says not the cruise ship he says not
[55:39] to Love Boat
[55:42] this is a USS Benjamin Franklin or
[55:44] whatever the no the greatest big one was
[55:46] John F Kennedy yeah this is USS
[55:49] John F Kennedy this is the we're on the
[55:51] boat now that that there's a fight every
[55:54] day
[55:55] you wake up every day and it's like
[55:57] Pearl Harbor all over again
[55:59] hey man if it's not for y'all pray for
[56:01] me please
[56:03] the reason is that character simply
[56:06] never is made without suffering
[56:08] character is a victory not a gift in
[56:10] other words God didn't give you this
[56:11] gift you gotta earn it
[56:14] it's a victory
[56:15] not a gift a man without character can't
[56:18] Reign because power apart from this
[56:20] character is satanic but Power with
[56:22] character is fit to rule
[56:26] look if it was purpose to the church the
[56:28] life that was in Christ isn't reflecting
[56:29] in you don't you stand still until you
[56:32] haven't got until you haven't got
[56:34] patience virtue and all these things
[56:36] brotherly kindness and all these things
[56:38] that's required so it's a requirement
[56:41] right Richard it's requirement
[56:43] hey man if you didn't know it you know
[56:46] it now it's a requirement this is
[56:48] required study this is this is your
[56:50] curriculum from now until the day you
[56:52] passed away or we take a body change
[56:57] and don't let up
[56:59] don't go third grade and say no I need
[57:00] to quit
[57:02] no somebody's going to graduate
[57:05] and the diploma they're going to get is
[57:07] a body change
[57:09] that's your diploma it's a body change
[57:11] if you go by the grade before then
[57:12] that's okay but somebody's got to get us
[57:15] up out of the ground somebody's got to
[57:17] come to this Perfection
[57:19] and then we were talking about hey you
[57:21] know it's all in your head well it all
[57:23] this is where I want to show you where
[57:24] memory reasoning conscious effects and
[57:26] Imagination it all starts in your head
[57:29] right
[57:31] you can't level your stomach
[57:34] well you can love to eat maybe but that
[57:36] comes from your mind that comes from
[57:38] your stomach telling your mind I need to
[57:40] eat
[57:41] right
[57:45] what we always say it has a mind of its
[57:47] own
[57:49] no it has one mind it originates from
[57:51] one place right it's not two or three
[57:53] different Minds no we're not some kind
[57:55] of schizophrenic with several different
[57:58] um
[57:58] uh whatever call characteristics or
[58:00] several different ways you know several
[58:02] different people several different
[58:03] people no
[58:04] you're either God or the devil one of
[58:06] the two
[58:08] James 1 6 is but let him ask in faith
[58:11] nothing wavering for he that waverth is
[58:13] like a wave of the sea driven with the
[58:15] wind and tossed for let not that man
[58:17] think that he shall receive anything of
[58:19] the Lord a double-minded man is unstable
[58:21] look in all his ways that's why you see
[58:25] people struggle when they're they're
[58:27] they're they're in they're in that uh
[58:29] transition of justification
[58:31] sanctification baptism in the Holy Ghost
[58:33] and if they don't go on to the Holy
[58:35] Ghost there'll be a double-minded person
[58:36] they'll have just enough religion to be
[58:38] over here and just enough of of the
[58:41] devil to be right here but remember if
[58:43] it like what was Bob preaching the other
[58:45] day
[58:47] right
[58:49] a question
[58:51] that's not totally answered in other
[58:53] words
[58:54] it's not true it's false
[58:56] right
[58:57] it's got to be complete truth
[59:00] because Eve got 99 truth
[59:05] from Satan
[59:08] not was included and that's it
[59:11] Thou shalt die surely die Thou shalt not
[59:14] surely die
[59:15] so a double-minded man is unstable in
[59:18] all his ways
[59:19] he's wavering he's uncertain he's
[59:21] doubting he's divided in interest what
[59:23] he wants to serve God and he wants to
[59:25] serve the devil too he wants to stay
[59:26] just in between so that he can do either
[59:29] one
[59:30] you know lean one way and you can tell
[59:32] that because those people are in and out
[59:34] of church
[59:36] they disappear they come back
[59:38] I'm sorry that's double-minded because
[59:41] if you're single-minded you'll come to
[59:43] church
[59:44] because mind of Christ comes to church
[59:48] all right the mind of the devil gives
[59:50] you every other excuse
[59:52] to stay out
[59:54] but the right mental attitude I love
[59:56] what brother Brown says about that
[59:57] because it's not it's not knowing the
[1:00:00] seals or knowing Daniel 70 weeks or the
[1:00:01] plagues of the vowels at this moment
[1:00:03] we're talking about but it's a right
[1:00:05] mental attitude
[1:00:07] all right it's like somebody said the
[1:00:08] other day if we come to church
[1:00:10] begrudgingly if we come to church
[1:00:11] because well if we don't really gonna
[1:00:13] say something about me
[1:00:15] then don't come right
[1:00:18] you got a walk to go
[1:00:21] Sunday's our day to worship God Sunday
[1:00:24] is our day to come together
[1:00:27] one day
[1:00:29] Wednesday too but one day Sunday we've
[1:00:32] dedicated I was thinking the other day
[1:00:34] at work I hear all of them around me and
[1:00:37] and some of them are some of them do go
[1:00:39] to church one one service but
[1:00:41] our Postmaster she's a she's not a
[1:00:44] Christian lady and she was telling them
[1:00:46] well Sunday I'm going to do this and
[1:00:48] then she'll come back on Fridays she'll
[1:00:49] say well Sunday I'm going to do this
[1:00:51] well it ain't going to church she's
[1:00:53] doing all of her work on Sunday cleaning
[1:00:56] the house cleaning the swimming pool out
[1:00:58] washing the car and you see what they're
[1:01:00] doing they're substituting something
[1:01:03] right for the desire to do something and
[1:01:07] knowing Sunday is the day set aside for
[1:01:09] God
[1:01:10] to me I see that
[1:01:12] to somebody else you may not
[1:01:15] it's like Tara said one time we was
[1:01:17] talking about having one service
[1:01:19] a Sunday and all right it came up a long
[1:01:22] time ago and he said some of y'all's
[1:01:24] already decided that
[1:01:29] so truth anyhow
[1:01:35] now the right mental attitude
[1:01:37] all you along here he's talking about
[1:01:39] people in the prayer officially being a
[1:01:40] prayer line your right mental attitude
[1:01:42] toward God's Divine promise will bring
[1:01:44] any promise to pass now maybe you don't
[1:01:47] believe that you say well my faith is
[1:01:49] weak I wouldn't confess it don't let the
[1:01:52] devil know that always say I've got good
[1:01:55] faith
[1:01:56] I believe God with all my heart
[1:02:00] see don't testify nothing of the devil
[1:02:03] you know we always said the devil made
[1:02:05] me do it no you did it the devil might
[1:02:08] have helped you do it but you're the one
[1:02:10] that did it because Satan can't
[1:02:12] physically now listen I think about this
[1:02:14] the other day too when we come to the
[1:02:17] fullness of God we are a we are going to
[1:02:20] be the son of man on Earth again right
[1:02:22] when we take a body change or when we
[1:02:24] get to the place of the Resurrection
[1:02:26] where death is not death is going to be
[1:02:27] destroyed by somebody saying Bride come
[1:02:30] out of the ground so Paul all the way to
[1:02:32] here Satan is going to see that power
[1:02:35] don't tell me he won't he's he's a
[1:02:37] powerful being himself and he's a
[1:02:39] spiritual being himself but there's no
[1:02:41] way that he can incarnate
[1:02:44] come on somebody listen he can't
[1:02:46] incarnate the pope and while we're here
[1:02:50] because you don't know how
[1:02:52] but he watches me and you he sees how
[1:02:54] God takes over us and changes us and
[1:02:58] he's going to literally step into that
[1:03:00] Pope
[1:03:01] and be the Beast not part of the Beast
[1:03:04] system right now they're part of the
[1:03:06] Beast system he's going to be the Beast
[1:03:08] he's going to be Satan and Kearney
[1:03:10] brother Brown said I was leading the
[1:03:12] other day Satan super Satan Superman
[1:03:14] yeah
[1:03:15] it's going to be that Pope and he's
[1:03:17] going to do signs wonders Miracles
[1:03:19] they're going to believe him and the
[1:03:21] whole world is going to fall down at his
[1:03:23] feet but not me and you we're going to
[1:03:25] be gone
[1:03:27] because you know what God has incarnated
[1:03:29] a bride now
[1:03:32] and took it out to our flesh
[1:03:34] that Fountain is going to so overflow
[1:03:36] until it's going to hit our body and our
[1:03:39] atoms will change according to what's
[1:03:41] inside of you
[1:03:43] because right now you've got it all
[1:03:44] encapsulated it's kind of like you know
[1:03:46] God's in there all cocooned up we just
[1:03:49] got to let him out amen you already got
[1:03:51] your body changed inside of you it's
[1:03:53] just what what is what's stopping you
[1:03:55] your heart
[1:03:56] everybody
[1:03:58] if you're born again your heart is not
[1:04:00] what's stopping you right
[1:04:02] it's what
[1:04:04] your memory reason conscious affection
[1:04:07] imagination what you think is what's
[1:04:10] keeping us here I say you I mean all of
[1:04:12] us
[1:04:14] so brother around tells us here about
[1:04:16] what
[1:04:17] how to know the will of God look know
[1:04:19] the will of God make sure you're
[1:04:21] objective and motive is right listen the
[1:04:24] reason I'm reading this our motive and
[1:04:25] objective is to be this
[1:04:28] at this point I want you to not
[1:04:31] say well I really want to learn Daniel
[1:04:33] 70 weeks well I really want to know what
[1:04:36] them Seven Seals are
[1:04:38] forget about it until you see only you
[1:04:41] get this
[1:04:42] and you know what I understand I'm
[1:04:44] trying to make it strong I don't say
[1:04:45] forget about it don't throw your seal
[1:04:46] book away but put that sailboat right
[1:04:48] here but put that statue a perfect man
[1:04:50] book right on top of it and read that
[1:04:52] first
[1:04:53] amen you can read a church age book
[1:04:56] that's fine that'll help you but all
[1:04:58] these Mysteries we're not going to get
[1:04:59] the Mysteries Paul said you can know all
[1:05:01] Mysteries
[1:05:03] and not have charity right
[1:05:06] which is the new birth
[1:05:09] and you just said blah blah blah blah
[1:05:11] sound embarrassed in a tinkling symbol
[1:05:13] but first know the will of God
[1:05:16] and my objective is what to glorify him
[1:05:18] and my motive is to give him all the
[1:05:20] glory that's what
[1:05:21] the statue of perfect man
[1:05:23] if your objective is to make money for
[1:05:25] yourself you'll never succeed
[1:05:28] and try to do something outside of the
[1:05:30] will of the Lord it won't work to begin
[1:05:32] with
[1:05:33] wow
[1:05:34] I'm just telling you what brother I
[1:05:36] believe he was a prophet right I'm the
[1:05:37] same place okay just wanted to make sure
[1:05:39] thank you brother Ryan give me that
[1:05:42] show us the father 1963 brother Ryan
[1:05:44] said look now he's pretty strong words I
[1:05:46] go on record I say this about the word
[1:05:49] of God being a seed and if you can take
[1:05:50] the right mental attitude toward any
[1:05:52] Divine promise he will bring it to pass
[1:05:54] if you can get yourself in what position
[1:05:59] what does teaching do it positionally
[1:06:01] places you that's why I said about this
[1:06:04] church you should know where you're at
[1:06:05] at all the time amen
[1:06:08] I don't understand this I don't
[1:06:10] understand that but I do understand this
[1:06:11] I do understand that maybe I don't
[1:06:13] understand Daniel 70 weeks right now
[1:06:15] maybe somebody will go over it again but
[1:06:17] do you have brotherly kindness
[1:06:21] can you love somebody that hates your
[1:06:23] guts
[1:06:25] ain't there yet
[1:06:29] well then don't get mad at the guy that
[1:06:30] cuts you off on the road
[1:06:35] brotherly kindness is not being kind to
[1:06:37] your
[1:06:38] brother that sits in this church
[1:06:43] well maybe yeah that too
[1:06:48] but it's loving those people that hate
[1:06:50] you it's loving those people that
[1:06:52] despitefully use you the ones that put
[1:06:55] you on a cross
[1:06:56] that's the one you're supposed to and
[1:06:58] love them so much
[1:07:00] until Nobody Knows the difference
[1:07:03] that's what brother Bram that's what
[1:07:05] brother Paul said I didn't know who was
[1:07:07] Daddy's enemies and I didn't know who
[1:07:09] his friends were he treated them all the
[1:07:10] same
[1:07:11] now I believe brother Brown knew who
[1:07:13] they were but they see they didn't
[1:07:14] change his attitude none whatsoever like
[1:07:16] I said this morning about God God knew
[1:07:18] before the foundational World we'd fail
[1:07:19] or pass right
[1:07:21] we've seen his son down here tonight for
[1:07:23] everybody anyway
[1:07:25] he died for all
[1:07:28] but he knew all wasn't going to take it
[1:07:30] he knew those two million people
[1:07:33] going through it took him 40 years to go
[1:07:36] 12 miles
[1:07:38] and he fed him
[1:07:40] clothed him
[1:07:42] yeah yeah give them all kind of
[1:07:45] protection
[1:07:46] but he knew only two was going to make
[1:07:48] it
[1:07:49] but yet he what he gave him a chance
[1:07:52] he gave me and you a chance didn't he
[1:07:55] man
[1:07:57] according to his divine power has given
[1:07:59] us all things that pertains unto life
[1:08:02] and godliness through the knowledge of
[1:08:04] him that called us to glory and virtue
[1:08:05] whereby giving unto us what exceeding
[1:08:08] great and precious promises that by
[1:08:10] these you might be partakers of the
[1:08:12] divine nature having escaped the
[1:08:14] corruption of the world through lust
[1:08:16] that's what we've been talking about the
[1:08:17] new birth and then the Bible says and
[1:08:19] besides this
[1:08:21] giving all diligence that means haste
[1:08:24] earnestness Earnest and accomplishing
[1:08:25] striving after anything interest oneself
[1:08:28] most earnestly so I said don't worry
[1:08:31] about the seals right now don't worry
[1:08:33] about the plays in the vowels don't
[1:08:34] worry about what we're going to eat in a
[1:08:35] millennium don't worry about what's
[1:08:36] going to go on in the Millennium or
[1:08:38] what's going to go in the future home I
[1:08:40] mean uh the marriage supper that'll all
[1:08:42] come
[1:08:44] we want to be we want to be able to help
[1:08:46] not listen what I'm saying we won't be
[1:08:48] able to be a help to God now
[1:08:50] and you know God don't need any help but
[1:08:53] he does want to work through you
[1:08:54] amen so let's just let's focus on that
[1:08:57] so add to your faith virtue into virtue
[1:09:00] knowledge that word add means Minister
[1:09:01] Minister nourishment so we're what we're
[1:09:04] being ministered to Faith we've been
[1:09:06] ministered virtue and knowledge and
[1:09:08] Temperance we've got to get it by the
[1:09:10] ministry as I said before you may get
[1:09:12] born again listening to a tape but you
[1:09:14] will not go up this statue of perfect
[1:09:16] man without a FireFold Ministry I'll
[1:09:18] promise you that that's thus saith the
[1:09:20] Bible
[1:09:21] that's what the Bible said yeah
[1:09:23] for the perfecting of the Saints for the
[1:09:25] edifying of the ministry till we all
[1:09:27] come to what Perfection that we be not
[1:09:29] babies anymore
[1:09:31] a person of virtue makes the progression
[1:09:33] from knowing what is right
[1:09:36] to doing what is right
[1:09:38] we don't want to be a knower we want to
[1:09:40] be a doer
[1:09:42] amen I know about this message I knew
[1:09:45] about this message when I was 14 years
[1:09:47] old
[1:09:48] but I didn't do anything about it
[1:09:51] I did not do anything about it neither
[1:09:53] did you until you there's no way to do
[1:09:54] anything about it till you get born
[1:09:55] again no way you cannot do anything
[1:09:58] about it until you get born again you
[1:10:00] get born again then we can start working
[1:10:02] then God can start working on you all
[1:10:04] right so these virtues are given to us
[1:10:06] what for an energy to me it to me it
[1:10:09] supercharges it not just charges if
[1:10:11] you're born again you're already charged
[1:10:13] but this supercharges you
[1:10:16] because remember what does God want God
[1:10:19] wants to adopt you
[1:10:21] to give you the checkbook not give you
[1:10:24] the checkbook with his name already on
[1:10:26] it he wants to give you a checkbook and
[1:10:28] say Bob whatever you need you write the
[1:10:30] check but you sign it
[1:10:33] amen well he's not power without
[1:10:34] character
[1:10:36] he'll write the wrong check
[1:10:38] pie with character he'll Rock the right
[1:10:40] check you know why because he'll have
[1:10:42] the mind of God right you'll not have
[1:10:44] the mind of man or be double-minded
[1:10:46] he'll have the mind of God to be able to
[1:10:48] write your check for what somebody needs
[1:10:50] or what he needs right you're not going
[1:10:52] to go out here and be able to move a
[1:10:54] mountain you're not going to go out here
[1:10:55] to Blue Ridge Mountains and say I want
[1:10:57] you all to move to to Arizona
[1:11:00] no that's frivolous that's power without
[1:11:03] character
[1:11:04] but if you need a mountain mood in your
[1:11:06] life if you need to get around something
[1:11:08] then guess what speak the word
[1:11:12] man here we stopped this where we was at
[1:11:13] this morning talk about affecting your
[1:11:15] senses what is your senses memory
[1:11:17] reasoning conscious imagination and
[1:11:19] affection remember the center realm of
[1:11:22] you is where the fountain is the center
[1:11:24] realm I said c-e-n-t-e-r not Center if
[1:11:28] you're not born again that is you're
[1:11:29] sitting around all right but Center
[1:11:31] realm of you it's where everything
[1:11:35] comes out
[1:11:36] everything starts from deep down inside
[1:11:38] of you every well that ever was dug
[1:11:41] starts from deep down inside it pushes
[1:11:43] its way up same way with me and you and
[1:11:46] you can't have bitter water and sweet
[1:11:47] water out the same well right we already
[1:11:50] know that so you can't have the new
[1:11:52] birth and not have the new birth you
[1:11:53] either you do or you don't I mean you
[1:11:55] can't have half
[1:11:57] sometimes they're sweet sometimes it's
[1:11:58] bitter no
[1:12:00] no
[1:12:01] so let's talk about they're just for men
[1:12:03] they don't have this in the back I
[1:12:05] pulled it off them I got off the
[1:12:07] internet
[1:12:08] the word memory means the faculty by
[1:12:11] which the Mind look stores
[1:12:15] and remembers
[1:12:17] information
[1:12:21] The Faculty by which the Mind stores and
[1:12:25] remembers
[1:12:27] information
[1:12:28] it also remembers something from the
[1:12:31] past because you can't remember the
[1:12:33] future
[1:12:35] anyway hello somebody
[1:12:38] you can't remember the future
[1:12:40] you remember the now in the past
[1:12:43] that's why God knows the future
[1:12:46] and the past and if you got the mind of
[1:12:48] Christ then you can tap into that
[1:12:51] and know the future
[1:12:53] brother right I'm tapped into it saw the
[1:12:55] future Paul stepped into it saw the
[1:12:58] future John definitely stepped into it
[1:13:00] and saw the future amen so you can do
[1:13:03] that but a normal human being can't do
[1:13:05] that they can't predict the future
[1:13:07] that's why brother Branham Swain was so
[1:13:09] used of God and not used of man he was
[1:13:11] used of God to be 100 right in telling
[1:13:15] people's future yeah 100 percent you
[1:13:19] know why because he saw it by Vision he
[1:13:21] saw him there the man with the green
[1:13:22] checkered shirt brother Billy brother um
[1:13:25] biscal was in that vision for an hour
[1:13:27] and a half before he looked down and
[1:13:28] realized he had on a green check his
[1:13:30] shirt
[1:13:31] he had to fall in the water
[1:13:34] you know have you ever heard the story
[1:13:35] you're deleted see it again how
[1:13:36] miraculous it was because what happened
[1:13:38] was brother bisco and brother Brown were
[1:13:40] hunting
[1:13:41] brother Brown said remember I saw the
[1:13:43] the green checking shirt and a man with
[1:13:44] little hands whenever the best school
[1:13:46] was a young boy then had little hands
[1:13:48] but he saw a great man with a green
[1:13:49] check his shirt didn't see his face
[1:13:51] so brother biscal takes him out hunting
[1:13:52] well brother biscal is jumping across
[1:13:54] the stream and falls in the water
[1:13:57] gets his clothes wet he goes back to the
[1:13:59] tent rumbles through the tent rumbles
[1:14:02] through his stuff and his wife had put
[1:14:03] that green checking shirt in there
[1:14:06] he didn't even know it because it's dry
[1:14:09] and it was a flannel shirt he picks it
[1:14:12] up puts it on goes back out they go
[1:14:15] hunting
[1:14:16] brother Branham even doesn't notice
[1:14:18] anything about it he shoots to whatever
[1:14:20] it was the Caribou or the bear or
[1:14:22] whatever and when they look brother
[1:14:23] Brown looks down he said this is that
[1:14:25] vision
[1:14:26] and he looks up and bro you know brother
[1:14:28] bicycle is going
[1:14:30] a great picture
[1:14:32] how'd that happen brother I'm saw it in
[1:14:34] a vision
[1:14:34] he literally saw the future
[1:14:37] happen and it happened exactly the way
[1:14:39] he said it was going to happen
[1:14:41] that's why I now listen you say well
[1:14:43] that was just for brother random brother
[1:14:45] Brown said we are prophetic people yes
[1:14:47] with prophetic Insight we may not be
[1:14:50] able to see exactly why and how they're
[1:14:53] going to take our money away and we
[1:14:55] can't buy or sell but I promise you if
[1:14:57] you don't have the word of God playing
[1:14:58] it inside of you it ain't gonna matter
[1:15:01] whether you know how to figure out
[1:15:04] to get around it yeah
[1:15:07] that's one thing that I just can't stand
[1:15:09] I can't stand people that says well if
[1:15:11] this don't work I got this
[1:15:13] you know if I don't if I don't make a
[1:15:15] Rapture in other words I ain't gonna
[1:15:16] live right
[1:15:18] but just in case I want to that's a
[1:15:20] double-minded man in case I do I'm gonna
[1:15:22] put me up a little bit of gold that's
[1:15:23] why I tell you about that guy that had
[1:15:24] the little gold bars that were one ounce
[1:15:26] which is like 13 or 1500 how you gonna
[1:15:29] take out of the grocery store and say
[1:15:30] give me a loaf of bread
[1:15:32] you gonna pay fifteen hundred dollars
[1:15:33] for a loaf of bread because they're not
[1:15:35] going to sit there and shave off enough
[1:15:36] to buy you a piece of bread with
[1:15:38] George Cara is silly to try to figure
[1:15:41] out how to make it I don't want to make
[1:15:42] it through the to the um
[1:15:44] tribulation I do not
[1:15:46] so I don't want to worry myself with
[1:15:49] thinking about what I would do if I made
[1:15:51] it through the trip in in the
[1:15:53] tribulation
[1:15:59] get the get the born-again experience
[1:16:01] folks and you ain't got work
[1:16:03] get bored again you don't have to worry
[1:16:05] about it
[1:16:08] all right memory
[1:16:11] our memories what kills us
[1:16:14] what we think about
[1:16:17] our memory of the things that we used to
[1:16:19] do
[1:16:20] remember we have to ask forgiveness of
[1:16:22] the things we used to do not the things
[1:16:24] we're fixing to do right
[1:16:28] you know we've heard preachers pray for
[1:16:30] for stuff like that and I just don't
[1:16:33] believe it I don't believe that you you
[1:16:34] can pray for something you ain't never
[1:16:36] done yet
[1:16:41] it's not true
[1:16:43] that's just kind of like the Catholic
[1:16:44] Church you know coming you you're saying
[1:16:46] okay I'm going to kill somebody tomorrow
[1:16:48] I said okay
[1:16:50] pay whatever fifty thousand dollars and
[1:16:53] you're good you're absolved or whatever
[1:16:55] they call it yeah to strand I knows what
[1:16:57] it is but that that's foolishness
[1:17:00] you ask forgiveness for what you've done
[1:17:03] and then what we have to do is then if I
[1:17:05] remember if it affects listen if this
[1:17:07] affects our memories and contraception
[1:17:09] imagination then you gotta let God
[1:17:12] change your memory to the good in right
[1:17:15] and when Satan brings that memory which
[1:17:18] he can
[1:17:19] you cast it out
[1:17:22] like I said before how many times did we
[1:17:25] sit around and just think about stuff in
[1:17:26] our past why do that
[1:17:29] why do that
[1:17:31] I'm not even one that sits around and go
[1:17:32] Coulda Shoulda Woulda
[1:17:35] I mean I know sometimes you do you say
[1:17:36] man finally made that choice I could
[1:17:38] have had a lot more money you know what
[1:17:39] you may not have been sitting in a
[1:17:40] church either hello
[1:17:44] right
[1:17:45] boy if I'd imagine yeah you've been over
[1:17:48] there with so-and-so amen you wouldn't
[1:17:50] be here
[1:17:54] take your memory and remember
[1:17:57] the good things remember what God's done
[1:18:00] for you Satan can't stand for you to
[1:18:02] tell him what God's done for you
[1:18:05] because he hates that because he can't
[1:18:06] do any good for you it's always bad
[1:18:08] everything he does is bad to you you and
[1:18:10] me amen so now let's take reasoning oh
[1:18:14] boy this is a good one the action of
[1:18:16] thinking about something in a logical
[1:18:19] sensible way
[1:18:22] all right listen the action of thinking
[1:18:25] about something in a logical sensible
[1:18:28] way that's okay that's the Bible says
[1:18:29] come let us reason together in other
[1:18:32] words take the facts and bring them
[1:18:34] together not reason on something you
[1:18:36] don't understand
[1:18:39] example was he explained the reasoning
[1:18:42] behind his decision of a media
[1:18:44] conference
[1:18:45] see God does the same thing he says come
[1:18:47] let us reason together but what does he
[1:18:49] do he brings us the truth so there's our
[1:18:52] standard right everybody with me
[1:18:56] that's the standard when God brings you
[1:18:59] a something to reason on he's got the
[1:19:01] truth
[1:19:02] that's this right here what you've got
[1:19:04] to do is a reason out in your mind not
[1:19:06] if it's right or wrong it's whether you
[1:19:08] can do it or not right
[1:19:09] or whether you want to do it or not
[1:19:13] come on
[1:19:15] boy you hate that but that's okay
[1:19:18] you know maybe you read in the Bible you
[1:19:19] weren't supposed to wear pants but you
[1:19:21] did for a long time you sisters
[1:19:23] we brothers did things that we've read
[1:19:25] in the Bible maybe when we were a kid
[1:19:26] that we didn't believe because we did
[1:19:28] them already we went and did them anyway
[1:19:30] hey man but now
[1:19:33] that you have the new birth
[1:19:35] see it's not that Fountain is pure water
[1:19:38] coming up and you're reasoning on the
[1:19:41] word of God you're not reasoning whether
[1:19:42] should I drink a beer today or tomorrow
[1:19:44] should I drink early or should I drink
[1:19:46] late anybody with me say Amen
[1:19:49] okay those of you that didn't drink put
[1:19:52] over whatever's in that little spot put
[1:19:54] it in there okay it doesn't matter
[1:19:55] whichever one you want to do smoke pot
[1:19:57] dope I don't care doesn't matter put it
[1:19:59] in there but you did it anyway
[1:20:01] we reasoned on the things of the world
[1:20:03] now we reason on the word of God not
[1:20:06] reason whether it's right or wrong
[1:20:08] reason whether we can connect ourselves
[1:20:09] to it anybody with me on that you reason
[1:20:12] whether you can connect yourself to that
[1:20:15] action of thinking about something in a
[1:20:18] logical sensible way brother Branham
[1:20:20] that quote where he says what
[1:20:23] excuse me he says the right mental
[1:20:26] attitude
[1:20:27] that's reasoning
[1:20:29] the right mentality listen you're
[1:20:31] sitting here with the disease
[1:20:34] they were sitting in that in that
[1:20:37] um Auditorium maybe couldn't get out of
[1:20:39] the wheelchair because they had cancer
[1:20:40] or whatever
[1:20:42] it's real
[1:20:44] but when brother Brown says the right
[1:20:46] mental attitude toward any promise of
[1:20:49] God will bring that promise to path past
[1:20:52] you've got a reason that that man's
[1:20:54] telling you the truth because in that
[1:20:57] service I believe it was that service or
[1:20:58] another service I was reading on where
[1:21:00] there was a woman that was in a
[1:21:02] wheelchair but she said he's the lady if
[1:21:03] you stand out what chair you're going to
[1:21:04] die
[1:21:06] yeah if I were you I'd get out of that
[1:21:09] wheelchair
[1:21:10] so she had to use her what her reasoning
[1:21:12] to reason that that man's telling her
[1:21:14] the truth that the promise of God was
[1:21:17] right same way with you and me on
[1:21:19] anything we do we got to look at the
[1:21:21] word of God just like brother Robin said
[1:21:22] look see if it's the will of God motive
[1:21:24] and objective listen that woman wanted
[1:21:27] to get better
[1:21:29] anybody that can settle I couldn't sit
[1:21:32] in a wheelchair all my life I'd want to
[1:21:34] get up I'd want to find a way to get up
[1:21:37] that's why they went to these meetings
[1:21:39] they wanted to see the Healer
[1:21:42] hey man we know brother I'm wanting the
[1:21:44] Healer but you know what they went to
[1:21:45] the right fountain
[1:21:47] they went to the right Fountain to get
[1:21:48] their healing they reasoned that this
[1:21:51] guy had a what had a connection with God
[1:21:54] the Centurion reason he didn't know that
[1:21:57] maybe didn't know that Jesus was a
[1:21:58] messiah but he knew that guy had a power
[1:22:00] a connection that he'd never seen before
[1:22:03] he said you just speak the word he took
[1:22:06] all what his old reasoning that he said
[1:22:09] I'm a man of power he's a man of power
[1:22:10] if I tell somebody to go left they go
[1:22:12] left if he tells that disease to leave
[1:22:14] it'll leave now he just that was his
[1:22:16] reasoning that's the reasoning we've got
[1:22:18] to use
[1:22:19] memory reasoning goes together because
[1:22:22] what is our reasoning what is it
[1:22:24] depending on what we remember
[1:22:28] if you've never read this Bible
[1:22:30] you can't reason on it
[1:22:35] but if you read it you can take your
[1:22:37] memory
[1:22:38] see how these are all connected you take
[1:22:40] the memory of you reading
[1:22:41] John 3 16.
[1:22:44] and you can reason that that's right
[1:22:46] and you can say well God you said this
[1:22:48] and this is what I'm going to do I'm
[1:22:49] going to get out of my wheelchair or I'm
[1:22:51] going to get out of the situation that
[1:22:52] I'm in or I'm going to take virtue
[1:22:56] knowledge tempers patience and Godless
[1:22:58] and I'm going to live them I'm going to
[1:22:59] let it be a part of my life
[1:23:02] remember doors and doors
[1:23:05] you got to let God in that door
[1:23:08] everybody with me you gotta let God in
[1:23:10] that door
[1:23:11] you can keep that door shut
[1:23:13] and he'll never do nothing remember he
[1:23:16] just Knocks
[1:23:19] because the doorknob's on the inside
[1:23:23] all right memory reasoning let's go to
[1:23:24] conscious
[1:23:26] real quick
[1:23:30] the question was does every human being
[1:23:31] have a conscience listen to the the
[1:23:33] reason of this the reasoning of this the
[1:23:37] concept of conscious as commonly used in
[1:23:40] its moral sense is the inherent ability
[1:23:43] of every look every healthy human being
[1:23:46] to perceive what is right and what is
[1:23:49] wrong
[1:23:53] you're conscious
[1:23:56] right
[1:23:57] on the strength of this perception to
[1:24:01] control and monitor and evaluate and
[1:24:03] execute their actions
[1:24:05] let me read that one more time because
[1:24:07] it's good
[1:24:08] the inherent ability of every healthy
[1:24:11] human being
[1:24:12] to what to perceive what is right
[1:24:15] and what is wrong and in other words
[1:24:17] know what to do about it
[1:24:20] remember go by your conscience go with
[1:24:23] your conscious people say go with your
[1:24:25] conscience what is it you're taking your
[1:24:26] memory and your reasoning and you're
[1:24:28] putting it all together
[1:24:30] and you're kicking out the bad you're
[1:24:31] putting in the good for us but you know
[1:24:34] what we did when we were sinners
[1:24:36] we kicked all the good out
[1:24:39] we care about the Bible we don't care
[1:24:41] what the Bible said about what we could
[1:24:42] what we should do and shouldn't do we
[1:24:44] did it anyway
[1:24:46] because we had no what the fountain that
[1:24:48] was coming up was dirty water
[1:24:50] right so we just stayed dirty
[1:24:52] so it's perceived what is right and
[1:24:54] wrong and on the strength of this
[1:24:55] perception
[1:24:57] all right is everybody with me on the
[1:24:58] strength of this perception what do I
[1:25:00] perceive but you know that lady said
[1:25:04] sir I perceive
[1:25:07] that you're a prophet
[1:25:09] she used her memory which took her back
[1:25:12] to where mama taught her that there was
[1:25:14] going to be a messiah everybody with me
[1:25:16] wake up just a man everybody's with me
[1:25:18] he took her memory back to we know when
[1:25:21] you say no that means memory
[1:25:24] we know that Messiah will come and do
[1:25:26] this
[1:25:27] all right you with me
[1:25:29] her reasoning was he told her who she
[1:25:32] was how many husbands she had had and
[1:25:35] she wasn't living with her husband at
[1:25:36] that point her reasoning was that guy
[1:25:40] must be the Messiah
[1:25:41] and through her Consciousness she made
[1:25:43] that statement right
[1:25:45] I perceive
[1:25:47] that you're a prophet what are you
[1:25:48] saying brother wait you got to know and
[1:25:51] perceive that you're being told the
[1:25:52] truth
[1:25:54] Bible
[1:25:56] prophet's message preaching of the
[1:25:58] Gospel
[1:26:00] you got to perceive you got to what in
[1:26:02] your conscious you remember what your
[1:26:04] conscious you know somebody says you
[1:26:06] does your conscience bother you
[1:26:08] right you've heard it says doesn't your
[1:26:10] conscious bother you
[1:26:11] well they did in the bad things
[1:26:14] but now also in the good thing
[1:26:16] because people go what a church every
[1:26:18] Sunday
[1:26:19] I have to go to church every Sunday I
[1:26:21] don't have to go to church every Sunday
[1:26:23] to be a Christian
[1:26:25] I thought what Bible you're reading
[1:26:27] what Bible you reading your memory must
[1:26:30] be something wrong
[1:26:32] wrong you've got a flu stopped up
[1:26:34] somewhere
[1:26:36] that it's a requirement for Christians
[1:26:38] to go to church
[1:26:40] boy it got quite didn't get one amen out
[1:26:42] of that
[1:26:43] wow
[1:26:45] one more time it's a requirement
[1:26:48] for Christians to go to church
[1:26:54] part of the curriculum
[1:26:59] I want y'all and everybody on the
[1:27:01] internet that's watching in
[1:27:03] to just think about one minute
[1:27:07] were you better off
[1:27:09] in that wishy-washy stage
[1:27:13] are you better off now when you know
[1:27:15] that you know that you know
[1:27:18] right oh well everybody woke up now
[1:27:20] I mean really come on think about it
[1:27:24] because you it is like a storm over here

[1:27:28] you didn't know where he was going to
[1:27:30] hit you from
[1:27:32] right but at least now with a moral
[1:27:34] compass a memory a reasoning conscious
[1:27:36] we're over here going this is for my
[1:27:39] good
[1:27:41] this is my battle
[1:27:43] this is for me to fight thank you Lord
[1:27:46] thank you that I'm heading toward a
[1:27:48] fiery furnace's hit hit seven times it's
[1:27:51] heated seven times more
[1:27:54] and I'm heading toward it and all it's
[1:27:56] going to do is burn my feathers off of
[1:27:57] my arms
[1:27:59] wow
[1:28:02] to me that's that moral part that now
[1:28:06] the water's pushing up the good water
[1:28:09] and we're getting it
[1:28:11] we're getting that part
[1:28:13] yeah I mean listen
[1:28:15] you hear as well as I do every day
[1:28:18] about how people are struggling out
[1:28:19] there in the world
[1:28:21] much less Christian
[1:28:24] I mean listen
[1:28:26] um Ann and them
[1:28:27] she knows one thing's for sure we're in
[1:28:29] the 21st century right Walmart's stack
[1:28:33] full of stuff we got so much stuff in
[1:28:35] our freezer
[1:28:36] well Mama might have to invite you over
[1:28:38] I'm not going to but she can invite you
[1:28:39] over there
[1:28:40] but she's got my stuff in the freezer we
[1:28:42] have to take and push it shut like this
[1:28:44] and lock it like this
[1:28:45] all of us do
[1:28:48] but there's people that when they had
[1:28:51] coveted during covet when the kids
[1:28:52] couldn't get to this that's the only
[1:28:54] meal they had yeah
[1:28:56] it's 21st century
[1:28:59] everybody with me yeah what a shame
[1:29:02] you know why politics
[1:29:06] politics
[1:29:08] you said no it's because it's all
[1:29:10] politics right
[1:29:12] a kid's not gonna get a meal because he
[1:29:14] can't go to school I thought going to
[1:29:16] school you learned yeah
[1:29:18] yeah when I went to school I knew I was
[1:29:20] going to get a meal but I had to pay
[1:29:21] well Mom and Daddy had to pay for it
[1:29:23] right and when I was going to school
[1:29:24] folks it was probably a quarter a week
[1:29:26] so what
[1:29:27] it may be five dollars a week or now or
[1:29:29] whatever it is but
[1:29:31] we got fed a meal
[1:29:36] same way with hair
[1:29:40] are we starving to death
[1:29:42] and have the greatest meal
[1:29:44] that's ever been give us
[1:29:47] whose fault is it
[1:29:49] hours yeah right it's our fault it's
[1:29:53] those poor kids parents fault that won't
[1:29:56] go to work
[1:30:01] to give them their food right
[1:30:04] right okay
[1:30:06] but you don't remember though that's the
[1:30:07] mentality
[1:30:09] that's the mentality
[1:30:11] I mean they're giving free meals now
[1:30:12] more than they ever have right
[1:30:14] free breakfast
[1:30:16] I got free breakfast but Mama cooked it
[1:30:21] let me tell you something
[1:30:24] I'm not an advocate of this but you kind
[1:30:27] of need to be home when your kids get
[1:30:28] ready to go to school because we were
[1:30:31] never sent to school with a Pop-Tart and
[1:30:34] a Coca-Cola right
[1:30:36] right Mama where are we ever
[1:30:38] that's why it's her fault I have to eat
[1:30:40] breakfast every day
[1:30:44] you know why
[1:30:46] she fed us breakfast every day
[1:30:48] about nine o'clock in the morning if I
[1:30:50] don't have something in this in this 55
[1:30:52] gallon drum of mine
[1:30:54] I get sick I do I get swimmy-headed and
[1:30:56] all that because she fed his breakfast
[1:30:57] Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday
[1:31:03] no break on Saturday
[1:31:05] Saturday and Sunday she fixed us
[1:31:10] hot food dance
[1:31:12] Anna
[1:31:14] hot food mama she knows that we had
[1:31:17] toast breakfast we had toast bacon eggs
[1:31:19] grits oh best grits in the world grits
[1:31:23] and all that and and and like I said
[1:31:25] before that wasn't well I'm just don't
[1:31:28] feel like getting up today so I'm gonna
[1:31:30] just send my kids to school with a with
[1:31:33] a Pop-Tart and a glass of water
[1:31:36] if you do that's your business
[1:31:39] but or nothing well see that's what
[1:31:41] they're doing I'm heading to that now
[1:31:44] it's nothing
[1:31:45] they're depend
[1:31:48] able to feed their kids
[1:31:51] are we depending on
[1:31:57] no we got to work for this
[1:31:59] God's not going to bring it to you and
[1:32:02] just hand it to you he is not a social
[1:32:04] program
[1:32:05] this is a fight this is a fight to the
[1:32:09] death
[1:32:10] and we're either going to win or lose
[1:32:12] everybody with me
[1:32:14] so in our Consciousness we need to be
[1:32:16] conscious that we've got everything we
[1:32:18] need we've got a mama that'll cook us
[1:32:21] hot meals
[1:32:24] it's called the Holy Ghost
[1:32:26] amen
[1:32:29] everybody with me on that that was a
[1:32:31] little life lesson there but that's how
[1:32:32] we grew up we didn't grow up depending
[1:32:35] on somebody else to feed us
[1:32:38] right we got fed ourselves right
[1:32:42] we went to school and learned
[1:32:46] supposed to learn this that's the way it
[1:32:48] was before you learned how to do that to
[1:32:50] your kids
[1:32:52] so you can make enough money to wear
[1:32:54] this where you could feed them
[1:32:56] Three Square meals a day or ever a
[1:32:58] couple at least
[1:32:59] but man I tell you
[1:33:03] they want no government cheese program
[1:33:05] when we was growing up
[1:33:06] and all that stuff wasn't my what none
[1:33:09] of that
[1:33:10] no Daddy worked got the eggs we might
[1:33:13] have had chicken or two we had a pig we
[1:33:15] killed it Jerome bless his heart don't
[1:33:18] ever name your animals if you're going
[1:33:20] to kill them
[1:33:23] I still think about that boy now
[1:33:25] see it's in my memory
[1:33:27] it's just really in my conscience
[1:33:30] I'm gonna cry
[1:33:32] but don't name me animals if you're
[1:33:33] gonna eat them okay just just don't do
[1:33:35] that all right
[1:33:37] but what are we depending on are we
[1:33:39] depending on just said anywhere we want
[1:33:42] to and God's just going to throw it out
[1:33:43] there to us no way
[1:33:45] you're gonna fight for every inch like I
[1:33:47] said before brother you'll fight for
[1:33:48] every inch not mile
[1:33:50] not not foot not not yard you're gonna
[1:33:53] fight for every inch
[1:33:57] inch
[1:33:58] that's little my new things
[1:34:02] but where are we gonna get fed we're
[1:34:04] gonna get fed where the food is
[1:34:07] just like we knew when we got up no
[1:34:10] matter what morning it was mom was
[1:34:12] cooking breakfast for us
[1:34:14] getting breakfast
[1:34:15] not pop Pop-Tarts or or giving us a
[1:34:18] Snicker bars or whatever it is and
[1:34:20] sending us out the door with a uh we
[1:34:22] call them things you
[1:34:23] um
[1:34:24] the juice little juice thing you stick
[1:34:26] to juice box
[1:34:28] no we ate there we're at at school I'm
[1:34:31] at home and then we went to school right
[1:34:33] right there wasn't on this grabbing and
[1:34:35] going
[1:34:37] I don't know where that come from but
[1:34:38] bless your heart it was my memory coming
[1:34:41] back of the good old days
[1:34:44] but is that what we're doing now though
[1:34:45] we're depending on God to just give us
[1:34:47] everything he's got it there for us
[1:34:50] but we got to get it
[1:34:52] and in our conscience we got to know
[1:34:56] like that woman at the well she knew in
[1:34:58] her conscious we know
[1:35:01] when Messiah comes he'll do these things
[1:35:03] we know that when the Holy Spirit comes
[1:35:06] in the end time he's going to do this
[1:35:08] this is what he's going to do he's not
[1:35:10] going to do Wesley or do Luther or do
[1:35:14] even Pentecost back in the 1906. no he's
[1:35:18] going to do what present day word amen
[1:35:20] he's going to give us Manna fresh Manna
[1:35:23] every day and listen you got to know
[1:35:25] where it's at because remember even
[1:35:27] though God reigned matter down to the
[1:35:29] children of Israel millions of pounds it
[1:35:32] had to be
[1:35:33] yeah to feed two million people yeah
[1:35:35] yeah it had to be millions of pounds
[1:35:37] that he rained out of heaven
[1:35:40] they had to go pick it up
[1:35:44] they didn't wake up and open the
[1:35:45] freezing but man there's all my Mana for
[1:35:49] the day no you had to what come on Mom
[1:35:53] you had to pick that man up
[1:35:55] every day
[1:35:57] except on Sunday or on Saturday at that
[1:35:59] time
[1:36:00] so what are we doing we got to be
[1:36:02] conscious to know where God is and what
[1:36:06] God's doing
[1:36:07] amen everybody with me all right
[1:36:09] imagination
[1:36:12] what is the meaning of imagination the
[1:36:14] act of power of look forming a mental
[1:36:17] image oh boy
[1:36:19] of something not present to the senses
[1:36:23] are never before holy perceived in
[1:36:26] reality
[1:36:28] creative ability in other words
[1:36:31] I imagine that tomorrow I'm going to get
[1:36:33] up and I'm going to go do so and so how
[1:36:36] many times you said that and it never
[1:36:37] worked right um yeah
[1:36:42] or you stayed up half the night or half
[1:36:44] the day worrying about something that
[1:36:45] never came to pass the next day
[1:36:48] that's your imagination working
[1:36:50] because you know what it wasn't real to
[1:36:52] begin with
[1:36:53] it never was real
[1:36:55] never was real to begin with it was all
[1:36:58] fabricated in your brain
[1:37:00] hey man so God doesn't have an
[1:37:03] imagination
[1:37:04] he doesn't think of something and it
[1:37:06] don't come to pass
[1:37:08] when he thinks it comes to pass that's
[1:37:10] the difference in us and him he doesn't
[1:37:13] have to think about something and say
[1:37:14] well I better not do it that way I
[1:37:15] better do another way no when he thinks
[1:37:18] it it comes to pass so listen hold on a
[1:37:19] minute you said that's God we must have
[1:37:22] the mind
[1:37:24] of Christ
[1:37:29] to know
[1:37:30] that when
[1:37:32] Jesus
[1:37:35] four days before Lazarus died
[1:37:40] Saul Lazarus died
[1:37:43] brother Brown said he saw a vision
[1:37:46] four days before
[1:37:48] he saw Lazarus died
[1:37:50] amen that wasn't an imagination
[1:37:54] that was reality
[1:37:56] because it was a vision
[1:37:58] do you and I know that if we pick up the
[1:38:00] vision of this message come on now
[1:38:01] people if we pick up the true vision of
[1:38:04] this message it's not an imagination
[1:38:07] it's a reality
[1:38:09] because this message because look hold
[1:38:11] on a minute you go out to the Baptist
[1:38:12] Church and you listen to they're going
[1:38:14] to preach you A good sermon I believe
[1:38:15] they do
[1:38:17] try to listen they're trying to get
[1:38:19] people saved
[1:38:20] not just out there trying to fill in
[1:38:21] space they're trying to get people safe
[1:38:22] but they're doing it with an imaginary
[1:38:26] word
[1:38:30] the Holy Ghost never baptized anybody in
[1:38:34] the titles of father son Holy Ghost
[1:38:38] that's an imagination of man's mind
[1:38:42] that God thank God he winked at the
[1:38:44] ignorance of man to let them do that
[1:38:47] until the truth came but once the truth
[1:38:50] came what happened they did away with it
[1:38:52] no we're not having that
[1:38:54] so what did God do he sent us a prophet
[1:38:57] to line us back up to get us start
[1:38:59] started straight again and what'd they
[1:39:00] do they fell backwards we kept going
[1:39:03] they fell backwards in their
[1:39:04] denominations listen if a preacher gets
[1:39:06] up here and said hey it's all right the
[1:39:07] man three or four times it's all right
[1:39:09] to wear pants it's all right to wear
[1:39:10] makeup where's he getting that from he's
[1:39:13] getting that from an imagination of his
[1:39:14] own mind or the imagination of somebody
[1:39:17] that put in his mind because that didn't
[1:39:19] come from God
[1:39:22] so wouldn't listen this is not an
[1:39:24] imaginary message
[1:39:26] so we need to cast down this imagination
[1:39:28] that we can get it by not doing this or
[1:39:31] we can get it because of doing this and
[1:39:33] it's not the will of God and it's not
[1:39:34] the word of God
[1:39:36] right
[1:39:37] so the true meaning of imagination the
[1:39:39] act of power forming a mental image of
[1:39:42] something not present to the senses or
[1:39:44] never before holy perceived in reality
[1:39:47] in other words it never came to pass
[1:39:49] and you can formulate it in your mind
[1:39:53] how this is going to happen
[1:39:55] I'm going I know Regina just got a new
[1:39:58] car
[1:40:00] so she formulated in her mind she's
[1:40:02] going to get a car
[1:40:03] right
[1:40:05] she imagined driving a Porsche
[1:40:11] yeah see what I mean you see imagine
[1:40:13] getting in a Tesla
[1:40:16] new car smell
[1:40:19] no gas
[1:40:20] to pump I just kind of plug that thing
[1:40:23] in
[1:40:23] that's an imagination of her mind
[1:40:25] because she's never gonna get one
[1:40:27] right now
[1:40:30] you didn't
[1:40:31] right not this time okay but you and my
[1:40:35] we always imagined these things that
[1:40:36] never come to pass like a but you
[1:40:38] can't do that with the word of God you
[1:40:40] can't imagine that's why now listen
[1:40:42] let's come back and get the ship back
[1:40:44] together again that we do have to have
[1:40:46] the right words or the right doctrine of
[1:40:50] Daniel 70 weeks of the Seven Seals and
[1:40:52] of all these different doctrines that
[1:40:54] man has what put their own imagination
[1:40:57] in brother by Adam never came and gave
[1:41:00] us an imaginary message
[1:41:02] put your faith on that
[1:41:04] not that he spoke was imaginary it was
[1:41:08] the mind of God it was bringing us back
[1:41:11] to cast down reasoning cast down
[1:41:13] imagination
[1:41:15] everybody okay with that let's get one
[1:41:17] more and then we'll then we'll take
[1:41:18] communion
[1:41:19] we'll get to this sometime
[1:41:22] later on
[1:41:23] what's the meaning of affection
[1:41:26] a feeling of liking and caring a feeling
[1:41:29] of liking and cared for someone or
[1:41:30] something
[1:41:32] fondness
[1:41:34] a moderate feeling or emotion that don't
[1:41:38] sound like agape love
[1:41:41] sounds like filial love
[1:41:44] remember all the different loaves
[1:41:45] there's lust and then infection for you
[1:41:47] you know I can me and me and Anna can
[1:41:50] hug each other because we're brother and
[1:41:51] sister
[1:41:53] but but I can't hug sister Anna that
[1:41:55] well this sister out of that way right
[1:41:56] or into you why
[1:41:58] different kind of love different kind of
[1:42:00] feeling
[1:42:01] any motion is going to come into into
[1:42:04] view right everybody with me on that
[1:42:07] so the affection that we have in that in
[1:42:10] the listen the affection this is where
[1:42:12] it's a paradox the affection that we
[1:42:14] have in the center Realm
[1:42:18] Center realm the soul
[1:42:21] is agape love
[1:42:25] God
[1:42:26] the love of God right there
[1:42:29] what runs around in our memories in
[1:42:31] conscious affection imagination is
[1:42:33] filial love or lust or whatever else
[1:42:36] that is Eros and all those different
[1:42:38] other kind of loves that's not in your
[1:42:40] soul if you're not born again yeah it is
[1:42:42] all that failed oh really yes it is yeah
[1:42:49] yeah cause don't tell me that Satan has
[1:42:51] agape love
[1:42:53] he's a destroyer if he's in your soul
[1:42:56] you don't have agape love
[1:42:59] you you have feel your love listen
[1:43:01] there's plenty of people that got
[1:43:03] married love each other and would just
[1:43:05] live together for a hundred years and
[1:43:07] never have the new birth
[1:43:10] but that's only filial love that will
[1:43:14] not get them to heaven
[1:43:16] that will not get them to heaven and you
[1:43:19] know
[1:43:20] people and praise God that people can
[1:43:23] stay together a long life you know Mom
[1:43:26] and Dad me and June's everyone's around
[1:43:28] here 40 50 years together 60 years
[1:43:30] together that's good but without agape
[1:43:33] love in your life you're not going to
[1:43:34] heaven
[1:43:36] you're not going to make it
[1:43:39] sorry
[1:43:41] what brother Brown say the angel told
[1:43:43] him the only thing that will get you
[1:43:45] here is what perfect love which is agape
[1:43:48] love not feel your love because look
[1:43:50] filio love has ups and downs
[1:43:54] right right agape love does not have ups
[1:43:58] and downs the ups and downs you have is
[1:44:00] because of you
[1:44:01] the ups and downs I have is because of
[1:44:03] me it's because I do have feel your love
[1:44:06] around that agape love
[1:44:08] and we'll talk about that maybe next
[1:44:10] Sunday
[1:44:11] you understand what I'm saying
[1:44:13] there's a difference there's a big
[1:44:15] difference in filial love and agape love
[1:44:18] big difference and I don't want to break
[1:44:19] it down so much maybe later on
[1:44:21] but this affection we're talking about
[1:44:23] here is liking and caring now if you
[1:44:25] take that liking and carry though and
[1:44:27] you put agape love in that very Central
[1:44:29] Realm
[1:44:30] look how it enhances
[1:44:34] look how it enhances to feel your love
[1:44:37] listen you can never have agape love for
[1:44:39] your wife
[1:44:40] brother I'm gonna tell you that
[1:44:42] you only have agape love for God
[1:44:45] feel your love is between me and Jim
[1:44:47] everybody with me I can't have that same
[1:44:49] emotion to Jesus Christ because you know
[1:44:52] what he's number one
[1:44:54] she's number two
[1:44:56] he's number one
[1:44:57] she's number two so you have agape love
[1:44:59] which is the love of God in your soul
[1:45:03] then it works its way out and we'll get
[1:45:05] to this later on everybody stand our
[1:45:07] feet
[1:45:08] uh
[1:45:11] all these memory reason conscious
[1:45:13] affection imagination they all are
[1:45:15] intertwined with each other
[1:45:18] and they're all in that middle Realm
[1:45:22] of you everybody with me so now if
[1:45:25] you're born again
[1:45:28] if you're born again today you have
[1:45:30] agape love in your soul
[1:45:33] it's locked in there you're sealed until
[1:45:35] the day of your Redemption you're going
[1:45:37] to you you're not just going to heaven
[1:45:40] you're bride
[1:45:42] I mean it's gonna be a lot of people not
[1:45:43] bright in heaven but you're going to be
[1:45:45] bride
[1:45:46] and you're going to have agape love and
[1:45:48] and somewhere in there
[1:45:51] even if you have to go by the grave
[1:45:53] that's going to what Break Forth
[1:45:55] and change this thing
[1:45:58] right because the love of God listen the
[1:46:01] love of God is what changes your body
[1:46:03] because he loved you so much he died in
[1:46:07] his
[1:46:08] to make sure you didn't have to and
[1:46:10] yours
[1:46:11] oh praise God what a what a Plan of
[1:46:13] Redemption that we is to me it's totally
[1:46:16] in a human being that's why most human
[1:46:18] beings can't fathom how that God that
[1:46:21] didn't need nobody that was eternal that
[1:46:23] didn't even uh need a molecule to
[1:46:25] Breathe by he decided
[1:46:28] to come down here
[1:46:30] and decided to die
[1:46:33] for me and you and go through the
[1:46:35] heartaches and trials that we went
[1:46:36] through and grew up as a man from a baby
[1:46:38] to a man and then died on a cross and
[1:46:41] then came back
[1:46:43] and now that's the mystery they don't
[1:46:45] know where he's at now
[1:46:47] but we know the mystery
[1:46:49] the mystery is Christ in you
[1:46:53] the hope of glory
[1:46:54] let's bow our heads the Lord thank you
[1:46:57] for this day that you give us
[1:46:59] we appreciate the time that we have Lord
[1:47:02] now as we go into another part of the
[1:47:04] service Lord the communion
[1:47:06] I pray that you sanctify us Lord for
[1:47:08] this journey father forgive us of our
[1:47:10] mistakes and sins Lord that we do
[1:47:11] against you Lord
[1:47:13] Lord help us to be more like you give us
[1:47:15] Lord and let that agape love just move
[1:47:18] its way to the outside Lord let us not
[1:47:20] keep it bottled up Lord let us be able
[1:47:22] to show we know the world we know the
[1:47:25] world for a fact shows the the worst
[1:47:28] kind of love Is Just sloppy and they
[1:47:32] whatever they want to do in the world it
[1:47:34] just it's just not good
[1:47:36] but Lord you gave us agape love
[1:47:39] the love of God
[1:47:42] that shed abroad in our hearts
[1:47:44] not to be where we go out and commit
[1:47:47] adultery every day or we go out and sin
[1:47:49] like that when our body every day Lord
[1:47:51] you've given us a moral compass
[1:47:53] you give us something to what you give
[1:47:56] us something to live by
[1:47:58] these five senses can be lived right or
[1:48:01] it can be lived they can be lived wrong
[1:48:04] lord it's just a choice that we make as
[1:48:06] a free moral agent we didn't get to read
[1:48:08] that Lord but the prophet of God tells
[1:48:10] us we're we're free moral agents even
[1:48:12] after we're born again
[1:48:14] so our Free Will agency will tell
[1:48:16] whether we can climb this ladder that
[1:48:18] Jacob saw in his vision of angels
[1:48:21] ascending and descending up into heaven
[1:48:23] that the statue of perfect man can be
[1:48:25] lived a living breathing instrumentality
[1:48:28] of God that's what the prophet told us
[1:48:30] and I believe that was you talking to us
[1:48:32] telling us that
[1:48:34] Lord I pray you should be with us in The
[1:48:36] Firm of the service be the ones Lord I
[1:48:37] think maybe they're probably on their
[1:48:39] way back from from Camp Lord I pray that
[1:48:41] you give them traveling mercies and be
[1:48:42] with them Lord and keep them safe be
[1:48:44] with us and further with this service
[1:48:45] Lord in Jesus name we pray
[1:48:48] amen
[1:48:51] we'll read we'll start there again
[1:48:54] own
[1:48:58] next Sunday brother Louise will be
[1:49:00] speaking
[1:49:02] this coming Wednesday night
[1:49:05] and I hope that helps us to help us to
[1:49:07] realize oh because listen when we
[1:49:10] there's one thing for sure when we when
[1:49:12] we go through life
[1:49:14] brother Dale's not right there with us
[1:49:15] the whole time
[1:49:18] all right he's not right there beside of
[1:49:19] us ever you know
[1:49:21] but now what he spoke is
[1:49:25] what he preached is
[1:49:27] yeah amen that's what Julie crafts was
[1:49:29] telling us the other day he said you
[1:49:30] know we he says she said sometimes we we
[1:49:32] see ourselves quoting what brother was
[1:49:34] quoted from the pulpit from you from
[1:49:37] years ago you hear us quoting that to
[1:49:39] other people
[1:49:40] well that's not brother Dale physically
[1:49:42] being there but that if the words he
[1:49:44] spoke were eternal life then that's what
[1:49:45] was standing there
[1:49:46] right that's why we're brother Branham
[1:49:48] the words he was speaking to us was
[1:49:49] eternal life that's why we speak it
[1:49:50] brother John that's why we have
[1:49:52] confidence in 1100 sermons I can pull up
[1:49:55] in this in this computer I can pull up
[1:49:58] something that brother Branham said
[1:50:01] and have confidence that that's what God
[1:50:03] Said
[1:50:04] right if you don't then you need to hit
[1:50:06] the altar we all do you need to have
[1:50:08] confidence in something but I have
[1:50:10] confidence that the words right I was
[1:50:13] wrong at one time right against the word
[1:50:15] of God contrary but then when he brought
[1:50:18] Holy Ghost then the Holy Ghost said hey
[1:50:20] read them 1100 sermons again
[1:50:24] read the Bible again
[1:50:26] with a different set of eyes with a
[1:50:28] different what with a different memory
[1:50:30] different reasoning different conscious
[1:50:33] different affection
[1:50:35] the Bible says set your what affection
[1:50:37] on things above
[1:50:40] not down here this can get into all kind
[1:50:43] of it's just gooey down here everybody
[1:50:46] wants that free love and you know you
[1:50:48] can just do this and do that and why it
[1:50:50] don't matter you do it's just your old
[1:50:52] body yeah it's just your body but it's
[1:50:53] controlled by that thing deep down
[1:50:55] inside of you amen
[1:50:57] because the things I used to do I do
[1:51:00] them no more things I used to do I do
[1:51:03] them no more why because you've been
[1:51:04] changed I've been changed I'm a new
[1:51:07] creation a brand new man why that man is
[1:51:09] one that's talking to us now that man's
[1:51:11] the one that's pushing the fountain up
[1:51:13] pushing the water up and now our
[1:51:15] Fountain is what pure water
[1:51:18] let's go into communion
[1:51:21] First Corinthians 11 if you want to read
[1:51:23] with me for I have received with the
[1:51:25] Lord
[1:51:25] that which also I delivered unto you
[1:51:27] that's the same night that's Lord Jesus
[1:51:29] the same night excuse me in which he was
[1:51:31] betrayed took bread
[1:51:33] and when he had given thanks he break it
[1:51:35] and said take it this is my body which
[1:51:37] is broken for you this due in
[1:51:39] remembrance of me after the same manner
[1:51:41] also he took the cut when he had stopped
[1:51:43] he said this cup is the New Testament in
[1:51:46] my blood this do you as often as you
[1:51:47] drink it in remembrance of me for as
[1:51:50] often as you eat this bread and drink
[1:51:52] this cup you do show the Lord's death
[1:51:54] till he comes you know you look back up
[1:51:57] there and say in remembrance of me those
[1:51:59] disciples remembered that night
[1:52:02] and when Jesus came back onto that
[1:52:04] Pentecost and filled them with the Holy
[1:52:06] Ghost the Bible says they broke bread in
[1:52:08] other words they took communion a lot
[1:52:09] they remembered that night
[1:52:12] he said you'll remember what you've done
[1:52:13] you don't probably don't know what
[1:52:15] you're doing now but you'll remember
[1:52:16] what you've done this night and this is
[1:52:18] a new testament in my beloved in other
[1:52:20] words your new testament disciples
[1:52:22] you're not Old Testament disciples
[1:52:24] anymore you're new when I come back on
[1:52:26] the day of Pentecost it's a new
[1:52:27] testament it's a new it's a new way of
[1:52:31] doing things not like it was before not
[1:52:34] the old way made over either
[1:52:36] the New Testament
[1:52:40] for as often as you eat this bread and
[1:52:41] drink this cup you do show the Lord's
[1:52:43] death till he come wherefore whosoever
[1:52:45] shall eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:52:46] of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty
[1:52:48] of the body and blood of the Lord but
[1:52:50] let a man examine himself and so let him
[1:52:52] eat of that bread and drink of that cup
[1:52:54] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:52:55] unworldly he doesn't drink contamination
[1:52:57] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[1:52:59] body for this cause many or weak and
[1:53:02] sickly among you in many sleep
[1:53:03] for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:53:05] should not be judged but when we are
[1:53:07] judged
[1:53:08] we are chasing of the Lord that we
[1:53:10] should not be condemned with the world
[1:53:12] wherefore my brother when you come
[1:53:13] together to eat tarry one for another
[1:53:15] and if any man hunger let him mean at
[1:53:17] home that you come out together into the
[1:53:19] condemnation and the rest will I sit in
[1:53:21] order
[1:53:22] when I come
[1:53:23] the Corinthians were just eating food
[1:53:25] and drinking and getting drunk at the
[1:53:27] communion table that's why Paul said
[1:53:29] don't do that
[1:53:30] you go eat at home you're not gonna do
[1:53:32] that in a sanctuary this is sacred this
[1:53:35] is something that we set aside from just
[1:53:37] eating and drinking you can go do that
[1:53:39] at home if you want to but don't do it
[1:53:40] here that's what he was saying
[1:53:42] and the rest will I set an order when I
[1:53:44] come so when he came back to Corinth II
[1:53:46] Corinthians they had to straighten out
[1:53:51] so I took the word to straighten them
[1:53:52] out took a preacher amen so let's tell
[1:53:54] you just for a moment and pray one for
[1:53:57] the other
[1:53:58] and just remember our pastor different
[1:54:01] ones Lord that's going through different
[1:54:02] situations Lord that you'll be with them
[1:54:15] we ask you blessings Lord and further in
[1:54:17] this service in Jesus name we pray amen
[1:54:20] he took bread and blessed it dear Lord
[1:54:22] Jesus thank you for this bread we know
[1:54:23] it's been made with holy hands
[1:54:25] and Lord it's just a simple recipe
[1:54:27] father
[1:54:28] so I pray that that simple recipe will
[1:54:30] now go into our hearts Lord and it will
[1:54:33] become part of us that this simple
[1:54:34] recipe Lord not something complicated or
[1:54:37] but it's a simple gospel that believe in
[1:54:39] the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be
[1:54:41] saved Lord I pray that you should save
[1:54:43] all of us father forgive us of our sin
[1:54:44] save us from ourself in Jesus name we
[1:54:47] pray amen
[1:54:51] yeah I won't be saved from me
[1:54:55] amen
[1:54:56] get saved from herself
[1:55:00] y'all excuse me pray for my my voice
[1:55:05] my throat it's just tickles I don't have
[1:55:07] any kind of
[1:55:08] junk in it just tickling
[1:55:15] I like when brother Branham went to uh
[1:55:17] he's somewhere he went for an
[1:55:19] examination and examined his his throat
[1:55:22] he's wondering why his throat was so
[1:55:24] scratchy and the doctor told him said
[1:55:25] well you got calluses on your on your
[1:55:28] vocal cords he said praise God he said
[1:55:31] Lord let me have some more if I'm gonna
[1:55:33] do it for you let me have some more of
[1:55:34] those
[1:55:35] I mean if I'm gonna have calluses you
[1:55:37] might as well have me either on my knees
[1:55:38] or in my mouth one of the two
[1:55:52] dear Lord Jesus this wine Lord has also
[1:55:55] been made with holy hands it's been
[1:55:57] prepared in a way Lord that it gets
[1:55:58] stronger and stronger just as your word
[1:56:00] every Sunday every Wednesday every time
[1:56:02] we listen to a tape Lord or our
[1:56:04] fellowship around you Lord the word of
[1:56:06] God gets stronger Lord I pray that

[1:58:21] that's fine but could it be just feel
[1:58:22] your love we'll find out one day
[1:58:27] you'll find out one day if it was just
[1:58:29] filial love
[1:58:31] because agape love can stand correction
[1:58:34] Agape Love is a judge
[1:58:38] agape love is not some sloppy
[1:58:42] um like we think about it down here no
[1:58:45] it's far above 10 000 times more
[1:58:49] than we've got here
[1:58:52] brother Branham I love my wife well I
[1:58:54] love my wife there he said you'll love
[1:58:56] the whole place ten thousand times more
[1:58:58] than you love and we can't fathom that I
[1:59:00] mean brother John can can you imagine
[1:59:03] loving sister Alicia 10 000 times more
[1:59:07] than you do now
[1:59:09] well you will
[1:59:10] and you know what you'll love me too
[1:59:14] ten thousand times more
[1:59:17] boy a lot of people that's going to be
[1:59:18] hard for him today
[1:59:27] everybody ready all right let's take
[1:59:40] well
[1:59:42] put my Bible up and I'm not done yet
[1:59:44] good grief
[1:59:48] yeah I said good grief they called me
[1:59:50] Charlie Brown in Ohio because I say good
[1:59:52] grief all the time
[1:59:53] I don't have a bald head yet though
[1:59:56] all right you ready
[1:59:58] and John
[2:00:03] that's what I needed that wine
[2:00:09] yes it will as soon as I get finished
[2:00:10] coughing
[2:00:12] except for being into this is John 12
[2:00:15] John 13 verse 2. if you want to follow
[2:00:17] along and suffer being suffer being
[2:00:19] ended the devil having now put in the
[2:00:21] Heart of Jesus heart
[2:00:24] in his soul
[2:00:26] because because God wasn't there
[2:00:28] Judah stepped I mean Satan stepped in
[2:00:31] and did what he was going to do
[2:00:33] all right
[2:00:35] put in the heart of Judas this carrot
[2:00:37] Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing
[2:00:38] that the father had given all things
[2:00:40] into his hand and that it was come from
[2:00:42] God and went to God he rises from supper
[2:00:44] laid aside His Garment and took a towel
[2:00:47] and girded himself
[2:00:49] we're going to get back to that
[2:00:51] scripture right there when he says that
[2:00:52] he was come from God and he went to God
[2:00:54] that's what your soul is now if you're
[2:00:56] born again
[2:00:58] it didn't come from your mom and daddy
[2:01:00] it came from God
[2:01:02] and it's going back to God
[2:01:03] because it is God
[2:01:05] if you're not you know what it's going
[2:01:07] to come from the devil go back to the
[2:01:08] devil one of the two all right
[2:01:11] but we'll get to that because you know
[2:01:13] what that's what's going to shine when
[2:01:14] this thing starts when we start going up
[2:01:16] this statue of perfect man that's what's
[2:01:17] going to shine
[2:01:19] that came from God
[2:01:21] your normal human self contrary to God
[2:01:26] did not come with that in it
[2:01:31] you had to be born again
[2:01:33] and by the new birth
[2:01:35] he could form these virtues inside of
[2:01:38] you
[2:01:39] so it came from God
[2:01:41] and it's going back to God
[2:01:42] all right so we'll get to that later on
[2:01:44] maybe a couple more years
[2:01:46] he rises from supper and lay decided His
[2:01:48] Garment took a towel and girded himself
[2:01:50] after that he pouredth water into a
[2:01:51] basement and began to wash the disciples
[2:01:53] feet and to wiped in with the towel over
[2:01:55] with he was girded then cometh heed of
[2:01:57] Simon Peter Peter said unto him Lord you
[2:02:00] wash my feet Jesus said unto him what I
[2:02:02] do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt
[2:02:05] know Hereafter thank God he could see in
[2:02:06] the future
[2:02:08] Peter I see Satan's sifting you as
[2:02:11] saying so I prayed for you
[2:02:15] he prayed for us too
[2:02:17] John 17 he said I pray for them Lord
[2:02:19] that I have chosen that's us
[2:02:23] Peter said unto him Thou shalt never
[2:02:25] wash my feet Jesus said if I wash thee
[2:02:28] not thou Hast no part with me Simon
[2:02:31] Peter said Lord not only in my feet not
[2:02:33] my feet only but also my hands and my
[2:02:36] head Jesus said unto him he that is
[2:02:37] washed need not safe to wash his feet
[2:02:40] but his clean ever wet and you are not
[2:02:43] all clean you are clean but not all for
[2:02:45] he knew who would betray him therefore
[2:02:47] he said you're not all clean
[2:02:49] so after he had washed their feet and
[2:02:51] taken His Garment and was set down again
[2:02:53] he said unto them know ye what I have
[2:02:56] done to you he's asking him a question
[2:02:59] you call me master and Lord and you say
[2:03:01] well for so I am
[2:03:03] if I then your Lord and Master have
[2:03:05] washed your feet you also ought to wash
[2:03:07] one another's feet for I have given you
[2:03:10] an example that you should do as I have
[2:03:12] done to you verily verily I say unto you
[2:03:15] the servant is not greater than his Lord
[2:03:18] see that's the whole thing if you don't
[2:03:20] wash feet that means you're saying
[2:03:21] yourself you've asserted yourself above
[2:03:25] the person that's standing and sitting
[2:03:26] there washing feet
[2:03:28] that's why he said
[2:03:30] you won't have no part with me because
[2:03:31] you don't put yourself way up here that
[2:03:33] you're better
[2:03:35] than that person washing feet my and
[2:03:38] that was God washing the people's feet
[2:03:39] that was God
[2:03:41] that wasn't a second person of a trinity
[2:03:42] that was God washing feet God washed
[2:03:45] those dirty feet of those people knowing
[2:03:48] one of them was the devil
[2:03:50] hmm
[2:03:51] so
[2:03:53] he also called Judas his friend too
[2:03:58] yeah remember in the garden Judas friend
[2:04:00] what are you doing here friend
[2:04:03] hmm
[2:04:04] if I then you Lord and Master have
[2:04:05] washed your feet you also ought to wash
[2:04:07] one another's feet for I have given you
[2:04:08] an example that you should do as I have
[2:04:10] done to you verily verily I say unto you
[2:04:12] the servant is not greater than his Lord
[2:04:14] neither he that is sent greater than he
[2:04:17] that sent him if you know these things
[2:04:19] happy
[2:04:20] happy are you if you do them let's bow
[2:04:24] our heads dear Lord thank you for this
[2:04:25] day that you give us
[2:04:27] for this time of communion Lord as we
[2:04:29] remember back even when we're singing
[2:04:31] the song that
[2:04:32] they raised you above
[2:04:35] Earth
[2:04:36] and put you on a cross
[2:04:38] and you hung there for hours
[2:04:41] for my sin you had told them just a few
[2:04:44] days before that or the day before that
[2:04:46] that that was what was going to happen
[2:04:48] and they didn't believe you and you went
[2:04:49] ahead and gave them communion washed
[2:04:51] their feet told Judas to go do what he
[2:04:53] was supposed to do
[2:04:55] but you had me on your mind
[2:04:59] me
[2:05:00] on your mind when you were on that cross
[2:05:03] Lord now not that just I can see you on
[2:05:06] the cross I see an empty cross
[2:05:09] I see an empty tomb
[2:05:12] but I see a soul that's filled with the
[2:05:14] Holy Ghost
[2:05:15] that used to be empty
[2:05:18] for years
[2:05:20] our soul as the song says was as black
[2:05:22] as night
[2:05:24] but Darkness
[2:05:26] has taken flight

[2:05:32] and by your grace
