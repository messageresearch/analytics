[0:04] [Music]
[0:05] god bless you and good morning let's
[0:07] turn back to hebrews chapter 2
[0:11] verse
[0:12] 12
[0:15] which is where we kind of left off last
[0:17] time
[0:17] [Music]
[0:19] and verse 12 says
[0:20] [Music]
[0:23] saying i will declare thy name unto my
[0:25] brethren in the midst of the church will
[0:26] i sing praise unto thee
[0:29] again i will put my trust in him and
[0:31] again behold i and the children which
[0:33] god has given me
[0:35] and last time we were kind of talking
[0:37] about how that that as you read these
[0:39] things that paul says um
[0:41] you know he's just fire and firing from
[0:43] the hip uh saying things rapidly and
[0:46] and a lot of it it would it would mean
[0:49] things to hebrews
[0:51] to a jew
[0:53] but without a lot of background some of
[0:55] these things would kind of go over our
[0:57] heads so we we're tying back this back
[0:59] to what what paul was quoting there in
[1:01] verse 13 last time was uh i will put my
[1:04] trust in him that's actually from psalms
[1:06] and again behold i and the children
[1:08] which god has given me
[1:09] is from isaiah and he's he's saying i
[1:12] will in isaiah isaiah said i will wait
[1:14] upon the lord that hideth his face from
[1:16] the house of jacob and i will look for
[1:18] him
[1:19] behold i and the children whom the lord
[1:21] hath given me are for signs and for
[1:22] wonders in israel from the lord of hosts
[1:25] which dwelleth in mount zion
[1:27] and if we go to the next slide just to
[1:28] kind of give a little background
[1:31] isaiah is talking about his he is his
[1:33] his two children
[1:35] share joshua a remnant which means a
[1:37] remnant will return and my herschel of
[1:39] hashbas which means quick to plunder
[1:41] swift to spoil and and his two children
[1:43] were given to him as as signs that when
[1:45] he would go to give his message to king
[1:47] ahaz he would take his children with him
[1:50] as a as a sign well he took shahir
[1:52] jashub with him
[1:53] and mahershala hashpaws was given a
[1:55] little bit later in the next chapter in
[1:57] isaiah
[1:58] to as as a further sign of what god will
[2:01] do if you didn't recognize his word and
[2:03] didn't obey him
[2:04] so isaiah 8 18 talking about behold i
[2:08] and the children whom the lord had given
[2:09] me are for signs and for wonders in
[2:11] israel from the lord of hosts
[2:13] so that's really speaking compare that
[2:15] with
[2:16] with what paul is saying in hebrews
[2:19] i am the children which god has given me
[2:21] paul is talking about uh
[2:25] the the child
[2:26] christ that has been given to us that
[2:28] would we would be part of
[2:30] and that we also with him would be would
[2:32] be signs to the world as we go and live
[2:34] our lives and and things which if you go
[2:37] to the next slide in john chapter 17 it
[2:40] says i have manifested thy name
[2:42] john speaking to the church i have
[2:44] manifested thy name unto that unto the
[2:45] men which thou get gave us me out of the
[2:47] world
[2:48] thine they were and thou gave us them me
[2:51] and they have kept that word
[2:53] so again that just goes hand in hand
[2:54] with what isaiah and paul are saying
[2:56] here behold i and the children which god
[2:59] has given me we're part we're part of
[3:00] jesus christ
[3:02] and and uh
[3:04] as galatians says for you are all the
[3:06] children of god by faith in christ jesus
[3:11] so um
[3:12] if if maybe that kind of wets your
[3:14] appetite to dive into that a little bit
[3:16] more go back and if you if you weren't
[3:18] here last sunday go back and listen to
[3:19] that last sunday school and
[3:21] and uh that that maybe maybe a little
[3:23] bit more details than that if we go to
[3:25] the next slide
[3:27] in uh verse 14 paul says for as much of
[3:30] them as the children
[3:32] so we're just talking about isaiah's
[3:34] children
[3:35] typing the children of god
[3:38] for as much then as the children are
[3:39] partakers of flesh and blood he also
[3:41] himself likewise took part of the same
[3:44] he came down to to
[3:46] to go through the the same
[3:49] troubles and things that we go through
[3:52] that through death he might destroy them
[3:54] that had the power of death
[3:56] that is the devil
[3:58] and deliver them who through fear of
[3:59] death were all their lifetimes subject
[4:01] to bondage
[4:03] so his purpose was to give us a way out
[4:06] of death and brother brown said that day
[4:08] on calvary that day on calvary he said
[4:10] that's what calvary meant
[4:12] men that were in bondage were set free
[4:16] men that were once under fear of death
[4:18] can no longer fear death
[4:20] a man who longs for a city whose builder
[4:22] and maker is god he can step on the
[4:24] highway and set his face towards heaven
[4:27] because he's free and why is he free
[4:29] because he has he has an understanding
[4:32] that god has delivered him
[4:34] from the
[4:35] the price of sin
[4:37] of he's given he's covered over the sin
[4:39] with his blood and he's he's he's paid
[4:42] the price for it and he's redeemed that
[4:44] man
[4:46] even though that maybe he still has to
[4:48] uh maybe in the lie in life death will
[4:50] catch up with you but yet the the the
[4:52] price of sin has been
[4:54] has been paid
[4:56] he's redeemed he said he don't need to
[4:58] wonder no more for there's a way of
[5:00] knowing whether you are right or not it
[5:02] isn't that a blessing to know we can sit
[5:03] here and know whether we're right or not
[5:05] and to know whether god has taken care
[5:08] of the situation or not to have a
[5:10] revelation to know that god has has has
[5:13] come on the scene for you and accepted
[5:15] your faith
[5:17] god gives us life our sins are gone that
[5:20] day at calvary paid the price
[5:22] so that's what paul is saying that
[5:24] christ came to take away the fear of
[5:26] death to take away the fear of living
[5:28] knowing that one day you're going to
[5:29] have to cross over that that chilly
[5:31] jordan river
[5:32] and and then
[5:33] you know even beyond that it as the
[5:35] message began to unfold that the last
[5:38] enemy is death we know
[5:40] so one day there's going to be somebody
[5:41] that that that does not even taste death
[5:44] that uh comes to a place
[5:46] of faith and of revelation to know that
[5:48] you've come
[5:49] you've com you can just step over it
[5:51] leap over a troop
[5:53] as the scripture goes
[5:55] so if we go to the next slide
[5:59] paul is talking about in first
[6:00] corinthians
[6:02] so when this corruptable shall have put
[6:04] on incorruption and this mortal shall
[6:05] have put on immortality then shall be
[6:07] brought to pass the saying that is
[6:09] written death is swallowed up in victory
[6:11] o death where is thy sting o grave where
[6:14] is thy victory the sting of death is sin
[6:17] and the strength of sin is the law so
[6:20] christ took away this the sting of death
[6:23] as we know the type of beings being
[6:25] stung by like a little bee that was the
[6:27] stinger stun stuck in him and it can't
[6:30] sting us anymore and the sting of death
[6:32] is sin so he took away he took away all
[6:34] of the sin from us
[6:37] now now how did he do it if we go you
[6:40] you know what paul's doing is in the
[6:42] first two chapters here is he's and and
[6:44] all through hebrews is he's comparing
[6:47] all of these things that the hebrews
[6:48] know about the angels the ministers the
[6:50] prophets and the law the torah that he's
[6:53] given it to us and he's saying that
[6:54] christ is the one that satisfies
[6:56] everything christ is above the angels
[6:58] he's above the ministers he's the one
[6:59] that we're looking at and so he as he
[7:02] goes on he's he's uh
[7:04] he's establishing that further as we
[7:06] read along that christ is the one that
[7:08] actually in the old testament you read
[7:10] about the seed of abraham and christ is
[7:12] the one that took upon himself the seed
[7:13] of abraham to satisfy what the law is
[7:16] talking about to fulfill what it's
[7:18] talking about so if we go to the next
[7:20] the next slide
[7:21] the seed of abraham we know that the
[7:23] seed of abraham is christ and we'll
[7:25] we'll kind of we'll kind of sit on this
[7:27] for a little bit longer in this little
[7:29] lesson what is what is the seed of
[7:31] abraham
[7:33] the seed of abraham was that promise
[7:34] that that god gave to abraham that thus
[7:37] and isaac thy seed shall be called and
[7:40] thy seed shall possess the gate of his
[7:42] enemies and
[7:43] thy seed will
[7:45] the whole world all the nations of the
[7:46] world be blessed through that seed so
[7:49] they see that you think about the seed
[7:50] of abraham being manifest in that little
[7:52] child crying in a in a manger there the
[7:55] seed of abraham was was was was the life
[7:59] of god made made manifest in in the
[8:02] flesh of a little baby
[8:05] that you really what what the seed of
[8:07] abraham is and what we'll dive into that
[8:09] a little bit more but looking at whether
[8:10] some of the things that brother brown
[8:11] said was it if we go to the next slide
[8:14] the seed this a seed is life it's got
[8:17] life in it
[8:18] so the seed of abraham
[8:20] has got something to do with life
[8:22] now if we go to the next slide after
[8:25] that
[8:26] and brother ram said oh my he didn't
[8:28] become an angel he become the seed of
[8:30] abraham
[8:31] and we being dead in christ take on
[8:34] abraham's seed and our heirs according
[8:36] to the promise he he never took on the
[8:39] form of an angel he never become an
[8:41] angel he'd become a man
[8:42] he become veiled in flesh that that life
[8:46] was put in flesh
[8:48] the same life so you see that if that
[8:49] life was in christ
[8:51] and that same life is in you
[8:54] and that makes you a seed of abraham
[8:56] that makes you part of that same life
[9:01] he said he become the seed of abraham
[9:03] and took the sting of death
[9:05] in his own flesh to reconcile us back to
[9:08] god and now sits there for an
[9:09] intercessor
[9:11] my how could we reject it friend
[9:13] now if we go to the next slide let's
[9:15] just do a little recap of where where in
[9:17] the bible the promise of the seed of
[9:20] abraham was given to abraham in genesis
[9:22] chapter 26
[9:23] god told abraham sojourn in this land
[9:26] and i will be with thee and will bless
[9:28] thee for unto thee and unto thy seed i
[9:30] want maybe one thing to kind of call out
[9:32] is i think this should give us
[9:33] confidence in this hour you know when
[9:35] you can when you pray and when you read
[9:37] the bible you you take these promises
[9:40] back knowing what the secret of abraham
[9:42] is and knowing that how you're connected
[9:45] to that you can take these promises back
[9:48] to god and lay them in front of him and
[9:50] say you promised it now bring it to pass
[9:53] he said sojourn in this land and i will
[9:55] be with you and will bless thee for unto
[9:57] thee and under thy seed i will give all
[10:00] these countries and i will perform the
[10:02] oath which i swear unto abraham thy
[10:04] father of course we know we know the
[10:06] seed it's got it's got like a there's a
[10:08] natural that in the natural abraham had
[10:11] his children he had a isaac and jacob
[10:13] and all of the 12 tribes and then from
[10:16] there they they you know propagated and
[10:19] filled the earth and and abraham didn't
[10:21] see a lot of these promises fulfilled in
[10:23] his day but when they came back from
[10:25] egypt all his his children returned back
[10:27] to the promised land and they saw the
[10:29] promises fulfilled that abraham was was
[10:32] promised back here in in genesis
[10:35] and he said i will make thy seed to
[10:37] multiply as the stars of heaven and i
[10:39] will give unto thy seed all these
[10:42] countries and in thy seas shall all the
[10:44] nations of the earth be blessed and
[10:47] there's that promise looking up to the
[10:49] stars of heaven a promise of something
[10:51] spiritual happening
[10:53] in one place he'd look down at the sand
[10:55] your seed is going to be like the sand
[10:56] that's that natural children of israel
[10:58] but looking up to the stars that's us
[11:01] that's you and i sitting here today that
[11:03] that that spiritual seed and through
[11:05] that seed all the nations of the earth
[11:07] will be blessed through what christ has
[11:09] done in our lives because that abraham
[11:12] obeyed my voice and kept my charge my
[11:15] commandments my statutes and my laws
[11:18] now in galatians chapter 3 verse 16
[11:21] paul is saying now to abraham and his
[11:24] seed were the promises made he saith not
[11:26] in the seasons of many but as a one and
[11:28] to thy seed which is which is christ
[11:30] that one seed not not not
[11:33] there's not a lot of different ideas
[11:35] there are not a lot a lot of different
[11:36] theologies there's only one that we go
[11:38] back to to get what we believe and
[11:40] that's christ the the one there's one
[11:43] that's living in our lives that that's
[11:46] why is that a as as the spirit of god
[11:48] has been manifested in our lives it's
[11:50] bringing into oneness with him because
[11:52] there's not a lot of different ideas
[11:54] that we're there's there's one truth
[11:55] there's one spirit there's one baptism
[12:00] one one way to get to get to god
[12:03] and he's that way but as a many but as
[12:06] of one and to thy seed which is christ
[12:08] now brother ran on the next light he
[12:10] said hear the seed and the seed is not
[12:12] air with the shuck he said hear the seed
[12:14] one
[12:15] one seed not seeds but one seed these
[12:18] seeds were not seed of abraham because
[12:20] abraham's seed was his faith seed
[12:23] that god was speaking of not his natural
[12:26] seed so they were elevating the
[12:28] abraham's seed to something
[12:31] it's not just natural but a spiritual in
[12:33] other words abraham abraham had a faith
[12:37] where he was able to look beyond the
[12:39] things that you could just see with your
[12:41] natural eye and he was looking to
[12:43] something supernatural he was looking to
[12:45] something unseen so when god gave him a
[12:48] promise that he was going to have a
[12:49] child he began to discard all of the
[12:52] all of the things that he could see with
[12:54] his natural eye getting older getting
[12:56] frailer getting weaker maybe sicknesses
[12:58] things and he began to look past that to
[13:01] a god that was able to make things come
[13:02] to pass
[13:04] he said because after sarah died abraham
[13:07] married another woman and had seven sons
[13:09] besides daughter so it wouldn't be
[13:11] abraham's seeds it was abraham's seed
[13:14] one
[13:15] and that was abraham's faith seed
[13:16] pointing to the royal seed that was to
[13:19] come through abraham's faith
[13:21] not abraham's natural life
[13:24] but abraham's spiritual life
[13:27] something spiritual taking place and
[13:29] that's why when we say well we're
[13:30] abraham c that you you you've got to
[13:33] dovetail with what abraham typed back
[13:36] there in the old testament to believe
[13:38] believe past all of the things that you
[13:40] can see with your natural eyes and not
[13:42] care about circumstances not care if
[13:45] what the doctor says or not care about
[13:47] uh maybe even others that don't seem
[13:49] like they're getting a blessing it
[13:50] doesn't matter what matters is god's
[13:52] word his word is the only thing that
[13:54] matters right so when you say you're
[13:57] abraham see you're
[13:59] saying something really great that god's
[14:01] life that same life is actually living
[14:04] inside you the same one that told
[14:07] abraham where to go and
[14:09] called him and
[14:11] and moved him from point a to point b
[14:14] that same one is living in you to
[14:16] testify
[14:17] and make you believe his word
[14:22] that's why brother braham said who took
[14:24] everything contrary to god's word and
[14:27] called as though it was not and believed
[14:29] god against hope believed in hope
[14:33] that's the real seed that we're speaking
[14:35] of
[14:37] now if we go to the next slide
[14:39] galatians 3 28 says there is neither jew
[14:42] nor greek paul talking about there's
[14:45] neither bond nor free there is neither
[14:47] male nor female for you are all one in
[14:49] christ jesus and if you be christ then
[14:52] are ye abraham's seed and heirs
[14:53] according to the promise so there
[14:55] there's your confidence right there and
[14:57] what what that you are abraham's seed if
[15:00] you're filled with the holy ghost and
[15:01] you're christ and you're part of him now
[15:03] verse 28 is something that's been
[15:05] debated a lot i i've heard people argue
[15:07] well well what you see this is the
[15:10] they'll say this is a scripture that
[15:11] says well women can preach in church and
[15:14] and and there's no difference between
[15:16] male and female and church and those
[15:18] sorts of things but no what this is what
[15:20] paul is saying here is that
[15:22] not not that there's no difference in
[15:24] that regard but when you with your
[15:27] access to god there's no difference
[15:29] in other words a woman in the church has
[15:31] the same access to christ at a male as
[15:34] the church there's no difference in the
[15:36] way if you've got a need in your in your
[15:38] life you can come to god just as boldly
[15:40] as a minister can a little sister a
[15:42] little child anybody in church can come
[15:45] because you're just as much abraham's
[15:48] seed as a minister behind the pulpit
[15:51] that's why i believe that the words of
[15:53] paul here are encouraging to us
[15:55] they're not discouraging they're
[15:57] encouraging to us to know that if you've
[15:58] got a problem in your life or if you've
[16:00] got some you've got these promises that
[16:02] you can lay hold to to know that
[16:08] same one that was with abraham he's with
[16:10] you
[16:15] now now you see on the next slide
[16:18] you gotta tie
[16:19] light the seat of abraham back to life
[16:22] and that's what you know in that message
[16:24] why it had to be shepherds by the ground
[16:26] he kind of labored on how that shepherd
[16:29] is not doesn't know so much about
[16:31] education it's not some major major and
[16:33] so much about politics and those kind of
[16:35] things but a shepherd it knows about
[16:37] life a shepherd can is guiding a sheep
[16:40] to where they can get life from so that
[16:42] they stay alive and they bear forth
[16:44] fruit and bear forth that that wool so
[16:47] that seed of abraham the same same way
[16:49] it's it's life and so brother and he
[16:52] swore by himself he said
[16:54] what is the seed of abraham abraham
[16:56] believed god and he said this little
[16:58] blood cell blood is where your life is
[17:01] he said a portion of it was in a shadow
[17:04] a shadow now
[17:06] a toning on abraham blood that blood in
[17:09] other words the life of god was back
[17:11] there working and moving in abraham's
[17:13] life despite all the circumstances and
[17:15] despite all the
[17:17] the failings and things that that
[17:18] abraham could see and then a
[17:21] lot getting taken away and having to go
[17:23] taking his men to fight after him and
[17:25] all of those kind of things it was the
[17:27] life of god working in his life
[17:30] and brother ram said he believed god it
[17:32] was imputed to him for righteousness
[17:34] because abraham believed in that life of
[17:37] god believed in god it was his faith was
[17:40] imputed to him for righteousness in
[17:42] other words god overlooked all of
[17:44] abraham's failings and all the things
[17:46] that he did wrong and said yeah but you
[17:48] believe me and because he believed it he
[17:51] t he he he like he he he just regarded
[17:55] abraham as as though he was
[17:57] righteousness he applied his own
[17:59] righteousness and abraham now
[18:01] that god's doing the same thing to us
[18:04] now if we believe god the same way that
[18:06] abraham believed god
[18:08] then despite all of our problems and our
[18:10] failings and things
[18:12] i'm not talking about greasy grace i'm
[18:14] talking about real believing
[18:16] he imputes his righteousness to us he
[18:18] gives he imparts his his righteousness
[18:21] to us to make us as righteous as god is
[18:24] and he said god called abraham by
[18:26] sovereign grace not because he was
[18:28] abraham he was just a man he said now
[18:32] look and every one of god's children is
[18:34] called the same way
[18:36] you can't save yourself there's nothing
[18:38] you can do if you're a sinner you can't
[18:41] come to god unless god called you jesus
[18:43] said no man can come to me except my
[18:45] father calls him and when the father
[18:47] calls him all that comes i'll give him
[18:49] everlasting life
[18:51] and i'll raise him up at the last day
[18:54] so what is a seed now see the seed of
[18:56] abraham we're talking about is life now
[18:58] that's why you click on that word if
[19:00] you're reading the bible and that with
[19:02] with that the table app that lets you
[19:04] click on the word and go back to the
[19:05] original greek lexicon
[19:08] it means that word seed means comes from
[19:11] the greek word sperma and i think we all
[19:13] know what that means
[19:14] and
[19:15] and the first definition highlighted
[19:17] there says from which a plant germinates
[19:19] the seed the green or kernel which
[19:21] contains it's within itself the germ of
[19:24] the future plants
[19:25] and highlighted further down whatever
[19:27] possesses vital force of life giving
[19:30] power
[19:31] so that seed of abraham is the life the
[19:34] seed of abraham is the life that that
[19:36] abraham was looking to it's the life
[19:38] actual the life of god
[19:40] so when you receive that seed
[19:43] when god puts his life in you
[19:46] then then you begin to understand and
[19:49] you begin to grow if we'll go to the
[19:50] next slide in matthew chapter 23 that
[19:52] parable that jesus gave he said he that
[19:55] receiveth seed into the good ground is
[19:57] he that heareth the word
[19:59] and understandeth it
[20:01] you think what we're doing as we're
[20:03] receiving this word and this spirit is
[20:05] quickening it it gives us understanding
[20:07] that that we are part of that same life
[20:10] that spoke to abraham and it's going to
[20:13] bear forth fruit and first john it says
[20:15] whoever is born of god does not commit
[20:17] sin why for his seed remaineth in him
[20:21] that seed of abraham is down in there so
[20:23] a real believer can't even sin a real
[20:26] believer why why can you not sin because
[20:28] the believer
[20:30] the believer the real believer the one
[20:31] that wrote the bible is on the inside
[20:34] and you cannot see him which means
[20:36] disbelief you can't disbelieve you can't
[20:38] just believe god's word
[20:40] because his seed is in you now now
[20:44] you could go you could go way down deep
[20:47] the rabbit hole or whatever with that
[20:49] and talk about all because you know
[20:51] brother ram said things like a
[20:52] christians are all the ones that sin but
[20:54] what does that mean we're
[20:56] down on the inside of your soul with
[20:58] that seed of abraham is there and it's
[20:59] given life in you and in your soul you
[21:02] cannot sin but yet in life in your
[21:04] spirit realm and in your flesh you can
[21:06] you go through life and you can you can
[21:08] make problems and think you constantly
[21:10] have to have to repent every day you're
[21:11] dying and so in your spirit realm you
[21:14] can you can make mistakes and do things
[21:15] that you need to repent of but down on
[21:17] the inside
[21:18] way down deep in that place that that
[21:21] that's really guiding you
[21:23] if it's been changed that seed of
[21:25] abraham is dwelling there and you're a
[21:27] real believer
[21:29] because you can't doubt the word you
[21:31] come to church and the world is preached
[21:32] and you you there's something inside of
[21:34] you that's got to say amen
[21:36] and and make you grieve when you do
[21:39] things wrong make you grieve when the
[21:41] outside man does things that are wrong
[21:44] but but his seed remains in you so you
[21:46] can't you can't sin
[21:48] i i i maybe i'm i'm very dogmatic about
[21:51] that but i believe it to the point that
[21:53] if you're really born again you're
[21:55] you're not going to leave this message
[21:56] if you're really born again this that's
[21:58] his seed is in you
[22:01] you're not
[22:02] you're not you're not going to get get
[22:04] uh
[22:05] pulled away by some some some odd
[22:07] doctrine or something because his seed
[22:09] remains in you right
[22:12] now if you go to the next slide brother
[22:14] braham said he swore by himself now who
[22:16] is the seed of abraham
[22:20] those who are filled with the holy ghost
[22:22] are seeds of abraham
[22:24] why because that seed you've received
[22:27] the seed and the seed is the life you've
[22:29] received the seed of his word and it's
[22:30] taken root in your heart and it's
[22:32] beginning to grow and grow like a little
[22:34] plant until it's sprouting up and maybe
[22:37] initially you don't see fruit but yeah
[22:39] give it time give it some time to grow
[22:42] like like when you're you're boiling a
[22:43] pot of water you don't sit there and
[22:45] look at it and you you plant the seed in
[22:47] the ground you don't sit there and look
[22:49] at it wait for it to come up but by and
[22:51] by is going to come up as you keep
[22:53] watering it keep coming to church and
[22:54] keep doing the things that a christian
[22:56] does by and by it will bear fruit that's
[23:00] what the seed of abraham is somebody
[23:02] that's been planted in christ and that
[23:04] same life that
[23:06] that same life is living in you
[23:09] amen
[23:12] in genesis 22 20 16 it says
[23:14] i said by myself i sworn god told
[23:17] abraham saith the lord for because thou
[23:19] has done this thing
[23:21] and it's not withheld that son and that
[23:23] only son
[23:24] that in blessing i'm this is the promise
[23:26] of the seed of abraham
[23:28] that in blessing i will bless thee and
[23:30] the musician can go ahead and come
[23:31] forward and we'll close on this
[23:33] that in blessing i will bless thee and
[23:35] in multiplying i will multiply thy seed
[23:37] as the stars of the heaven and as the
[23:39] sand which is upon the seashore
[23:42] and thy seed shall possess the gate of
[23:45] his enemies
[23:47] and in that seed shall all the nations
[23:49] of the earth be blessed because thou
[23:52] hast obeyed my voice
[23:53] so if you've got a promise
[23:55] that his seed will possess the gate of
[23:58] every enemy amen
[24:00] amen
[24:01] be blessed
[24:05] [Applause]
