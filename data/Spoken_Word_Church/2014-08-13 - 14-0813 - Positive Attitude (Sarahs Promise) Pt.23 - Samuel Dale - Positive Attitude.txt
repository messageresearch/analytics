believing we can receive it and we ask you to just have your way lord and bless each one of us in your love and grace and thank you for saving our souls for guiding us and keeping us because it's all in you anyway and we pray that as what we're trying to say tonight would be worthy of what you would have to be said and we we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen okay hebrews 11 we're reading one and two you know to get a point now faith is a substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it by faith the elders obtained a good report now we're going to each one with taking the report that they made so verse 11 says through faith also sarah herself conceived strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised now putting these two together because it it has a connection therefore spraying there even of one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky in multitude and as the sand which is by the seashore innumerable so you may be seated lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now we are trying to take each one of these in our studies and things and going through some of the things you know the the points of looking at them and and seeing each one and you know their time and being and we went through able and then we went through noah and uh you know enoch then on to noah and then through abraham the last wednesday night and uh speaking about you know abraham's journey this past wednesday night then we were down about talking about our journey because the prophet of god said on the message who is this melchizedek said here he unfolds what all the attributes will do in the final end now what happened in abraham that we can look at and know that will happen in you and i abraham met god many times personally talking to him hearing him uh you know only in his journey but then one day he met melchizedek well we know then according to the message of the hour that melchizedek was almighty god okay all right so then he met god in a form of a man and was standing there and he was called melchizedek all right who was that the word right right the word made of flesh stepped into it you know and was down with abraham and doing that then it shows that every true believer will meet the word for the day that we're living all right you you know you can go back with the ages and say that that each age had a part of the word okay and is coming forth as giving understanding and being to that point and seeing that the word of their age was what they were making manifest but then we come down to the end of the point that i like to think of it like this that abraham met melchizedek talked with him etc and that was the word right almighty god creating a body and coming living in it but it's not it's not for you and i to just meet the word that's right i hope you was listening to what i was trying to bring out there the other night see we're not to just meet the word or know the word or how the word or or you know we thank god for all of that but we must become the word amen for the age that we're living all right then we found too that in this age that it's the promise of the entire word that's right i mean as far as man knows of almighty god there'll be a message of cheer down through the endless ages that we're not uh worried about but for what is to be revealed in this day and time then we are the ones that will meet melchizedek or have met melchizedek in the form of the word i've taught you and believed that this message is the uh you know the thing to carry us through the journey and it winds up being the headstone to the body i believe the opening of those seals is that point of the connecting of the word to the body and showing the day and the hour and we're living all right what has been our thought throughout this whole 20-something messages a positive attitude all right and the only way you can have a positive attitude is for you to have a personal contact with god all right now you can say well these people over here they do this they do that i'm not throwing off on nobody just telling it the way it goes the way it is you can say they have a positive attitude look at them look at all they're doing well that's great look at all the hospitals look at all the beautiful things that is being done in the world today by the what we call the religious society all right but in all of that they can do every bit of that and not meet the word amen but yet they claim to have the word and they do to a degree and they can take so much of the word the prophet said and make it work all right but we are not to just meet the word amen you know i told you before many times anybody in the bible had ever amounted to anything had a personal contact with god for that age all right and see doing that then we can see coming down through the bible get into the new testament coming on down that as those ages come forth they had a word to be brought all right but we're not to just to have a word to be brought we are to be the word made flesh i believe that i've always taught it that way that's why i believe when the prophet of god said the bride to be the fullness of the godhead bodily i can say amen because i believe it i believe that we've been down through those things and seeing the ages that we represent and that we don't represent pentecost as mary did we are to be back to the original seed that went into the ground all right in doing that then we have the most we everything is we'll get to it when we finish with this little maybe one more message uh then we'll get into the day without us cannot be made perfect all right because see everything behind us is dependent on you and i yeah we have a wonderful opportunity but we have a great responsibility all right and the responsibility is to uh not to just talk about the word but to be the word all right now it may be surprising when we get into those things because what a lot of people talk about when you meet the word i'll put it in this way and you'll see where my thoughts going a lot of people says well brother dale what do you mean in us becoming the word well one side will take it as memorize it know it to the letter all right we know that's good but it won't manifest the way god wants it and we know also that you take the other side of it and say well okay let's find everything we're supposed to do and we'll do it let's find everything that we're not to do and we won't do it and we'll become the word well that won't go that way either so we've got to find the middle of the road all right now i'm going to say this up front and then come back to it later and you hold on to it we're going to talk about sarah's journey tonight all right and the point i want you to get is is that she went through a journey all right she had a journey just like abraham had a journey but we want to look at the bad part of it we you mentioned sarah give her and she's done this and she's done that and she's done with hagar and she's done this she's done that and you know all we can think about is the the bad parts but what if the prophet would say that sarah represents the church today see if you're computer-minded and run through it you'll say sarah represented wesley that's true what that's true but what about sarah representing you and i yeah but now we don't want to be related with sarah we'll be related with abraham well i wish for one time that you could become out of such a supernatural super-duper revelation faith and i hope to god this goes across right but get down to being human beings who have a contact with god and that's the only thing that makes us super duper is our contact with god all right we think we're the great revelated people well that's all right but can we look back in the bible and relate to those in the bible oh yeah we like to relate to to abel we we like to relate to enoch and we like to relate to noah and we like to relate to abraham you know and those things but what about our relationship with sarah or our connection are watching her journey and see that you and i have all taken the same journey no i've taken i've taken abraham's i don't be relating sarah well then you'd leave wesley out because she does represent the tassel we don't want to be related with hagar but yet according to seed not air with a shock hagar represented luther and justification but you see we're so revelated to we don't want to be connected with any of those things but you know sometimes to just sit down and look back there and see what they've done it might help you and i in our journey right right all right to think about natural people doing natural things all right relating it to the bride of christ and seeing the day and the hour that we're living amen we want to talk about abrahams see i want my connections to abraham right that's where we want to be but you know in genesis 17 17 and 18. let's go back with the line we're trying to train josiah i reckon he's back there and uh i told him i'd try to be a little you know not jump around so much i try to stick with my notes where he can follow so brothers josiah he's hooked up on there and he's training and uh zach is supposed to be back there and we want him to get you know into doing it where that we need them and they can help and do things all right and so go ahead and pull up number one which is genesis 18. and let's just think about sarah and her journey all right we we like to lay on this one real heavy don't we that sarah lifed within herself and saying how can this happen how can these things take place if sarah was laughing and we know the story and we like to relate it and it's fine according to what you're comparing it with in the point that if it hadn't been for abraham you know abram at the time to have taken care of sarah there's been a lot of problems all right but we want to stay on that point but see we don't want to get to number two go ahead which is now remember genesis 18. now number two is genesis 17 and according to my mathematical calculation that comes before the 18. it's okay god's speaking to abraham and he fell on his face and lied doesn't got his name changed done met god on many things and he laughed it just says oh sarah that she kind of giggled that the way the prophet described it says she kind of just giggled you know said can it be this way abraham when god speaks to him which is prior to speaking to where it happens with sarah he falls on his face and he's laughing then he gets up and he says name change met melchizedek and all of these things many times in his journey he met god and he gets up and he's trying to deal with god oh that is one might live before thee see we want to put all of the relationship with the fact that sarah liked we want to read over in the scriptures it said abraham doubted not right we want to put it that way all right now let's put it that way so remember we read here in genesis i mean in in hebrews 11 11 it says talking of sarah and it doesn't mention her doubting right come on we read hebrews 11 11 and it says that she through what through faith also sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was pissed age because she judged him faithful who had promised now you know the story down through the doings of abraham and sarah that he starts off abram and god speaks to him and tells him he's going to have a child and but you know he doesn't tell him who is going to come through right come on he doesn't tell him first off it's going to be sarah so abraham listens to sarah the part we want to try to relate to her and make her look so bad that she doubted the promise of god said let hagar have the child and i was looking at a quote there a minute ago and and i was going to write this down in my bible and i will have it down where brother branham on the message sees not air with a shuck in los angeles california paragraph 39 he said abram didn't abraham didn't want to do that but god told him to go ahead and do it anyhow amen now that's not in the scripture of god saying abraham go ahead that's brother branham telling us what's in the scriptures all right so abraham goes along with sarah all right and you get a hagar but remember hagar's got to be in the promised son ours were you going to swallow and say you missed it brother dale because hagar represented luther of justification is not that the promised son right i know you're sitting mighty quiet you ain't even blinking most of you but because you probably never thought on that line but read seeds not air with a shock hagar represented justification well if you're going to leave gar out of the whole thing then you're going to leave luther out of it and brother branham says luther took his like hagar said took his child and gave it over to a denomination that's what luther done with it what are you following me now picking up things that you don't generally think of to put it into a line of seeing what took place in sarah's journey that is related to our journey oh we we we want to be related to abraham that's what i'm saying right all right then but remember sarah finally learns that the promise is to come from her right you know i mean well we're in the journey and they're doing everything in the world they can to try to figure out how to get everything to work about the promise and one day god says to abraham says sarah is going to have the child amen well that's when abraham begins to life because he's got a hagar and he's got an ismo but he knows that's not the promised son that god promised him would come from him right so sarah's got a journey and i like it the way that it says because it'll say by faith abraham uh abraham by faith nor by faith you know by faith abel by faith the different ones that it goes on through but the siren says true faith i think we need to relate to sarah just a little bit and get our super-duper mind off of relating to abraham that might be an odd way of putting things right i'd like you to go home and think that over like i told a man the other day we were talking to him i said we need to quit right now and let you think this over can you relate yourself with sarah no i don't want to i ain't relating to sarah well i will remind you that something happened somewhere in the journey and you know what sarah wound up having a child that was the promise so take your super-dupers and bring the children you can't get it's more here without sarah verizoa excuse me you get excellent through hagar you can't get isaac without sarah said no god can do what he wants to not when he says what he's going to do he can't change from that right amen all right he hadn't told abram or abraham later either who the child was coming through but he knew who it was coming through we know that each church age had its part and its time luther had all day wesley had a day baptist saturday method of saturday presbyterian etc part of the word of god all right but we know that each one of those coming all the way down to azusa street to represent mary the prophet says see not out with a shock and he actually says in there says mary's not the seed remember that we've been through this before well mary wasn't the seed the seed was inside of mary amen not leaving out of zeus the street is not being a part of it we've got to have all of that to bring it down to the hour that we're living but there's also got to be a group of people to represent the restored original word oh brother dale you make it so complicated is that complicated you know is it complicated to take all of the years or the profit and his studies and bringing it down and showing that this age now it's complicated because you don't want to read the books and listen to the tapes and pay attention so you want your ideas your thoughts your concept well okay go ahead i'm just me all right at least there's a way i can see it come together and make a beautiful picture anything we want to think about sarah laughing doing this or that or the other remember some way somehow she came to a place until she produced the seed that god was intended to bring amen well you know i'm not much worried about the problems the main thing i'm concerned with is sarah reaching an end in her faith because it says through faith a journey and through her journey how would you like to be sarah and your husband give you away two times trying to save his own neck i've always said i've got confidence in my wife she wouldn't put up with that and if i was her and she was me i wouldn't put up with it either there's some things that there's no type of you know everybody says oh everything's a type well now take abraham giving his wife away two times and type that and here comes his son isaac and you know what the old boy does he gives away his wife just like daddy well you know what i'm as honest as i can be there's not as much bad when you really begin to look at it in the life of sarah as there is in the life of abraham come on be sensible read your bible and think it over she simply doubts the promise of god well now you tell me that abraham didn't doubt from along the journey but yet when it's written of him later he said he doubted not you know what because god didn't see it well you know what for sarah to produce the child you know that god didn't see her doubting and remember what i said there a while ago and even about hagar and sarah doubting that god tells abraham to go do what sarah said that's why i love that part if you don't like that you read what the prophet said see that i already shook los angeles california paragraph 39 god tells him to go ahead because god knew there was going to have to be a top to get a justification right he knew they'd have to be a type to get a sanctification right and then there'd have to be a type to get a baptism of the holy ghost and then they'd have to be not a type but a total completion of the word are you listening say relies abraham life sarah's not mentioned anymore about her doing other than her fussing between her and hagar and keeping abraham in trouble between two wives and anybody that's got twos got two troubles you know i certainly am glad that we don't believe in polygamy because there would be a lot of bachelors once they realized putting up with that no brother homer longor says think david had 700 wives and 700 mother-in-laws all right but listen what's my point god finally tells after abraham his name is changed after all the things happened and even after his name is he's trying to still deal with god to get ishmael to be the promise he finally tells him he said sarah is going to hell the child well he just rolled over and lies but you know god didn't see that so he never seen his doubts you know what but he never seen sarah's doubts either okay remember sarah's the top of the church today we'll read that in a minute he finally tells abraham the promised son and where it's going to become abraham goes and tells sarah sarah god just told me you're going to have the child you know what she must have believed him that's why i was wanting to read that scripture where we'd think about our day and our time thinking about us but reading about that or it says true faith also sarah herself receives strength now you know what that means in the whole point she was turned back young would not only turn back young but she had to be turned back to her that you know she could have children because she couldn't have anything to start with all right so i kind of believe that after a little while maybe sarah's getting the idea you know how long has it took us to get the idea where do you hear it in this message taught about that we not just have to have the word we must become the word you know that we must be the word amen so about the time that sarah it's a change and she's young and if you'll read your scripture it's it'll tell you in there that first off they're dealing with a year i meant to bring that if you read your scripture you'll find out their first dealing with a year in other words like within one year so it's not a set thing it's like in one year read your bible all right i'd like for you to read why he said he was reading today and and found out that nehemiah was talking about how abraham got abram got his name changed abraham well i like for you to get to read in a little bit so it gives kind of a year's basis but then one day a personal contact comes and says within the time of life brother brown said 28 days you realize she could have been turned back to a young woman abraham gets up in the morning and looks over there and he says what savior's going to be mad at this because i'm in the bed with a strange woman he stumbles around and he walks over and there's a piece of something he can look at he said i can pretty well understand how she got in here but how did i get in here young you know i mean i'm wound up being young now but you know even though they were turned back young that's why it says she received strength see she was brought back to her position but her position was childish when she had that first monthly thing i imagine sarah begins to believe don't you he said god made a promise but did you notice what she said conceived seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who made the promise you know what she finally caught on all right you know what god doesn't write a thing about her unbelief and her doubting and her thing no more than he did he didn't write about abraham because he's looking past and you know what he don't write it about you and i he don't write our downfalls and our problems and our doubtings he looks to see whether we can believe the promise now do you understand what i'm aiming at this age is promised the seed of the entire word to be made manifest in this age do we believe it amen or is that just a good story do we actually believe that god's going to bring it to pies i hope we're through they're trying to deal with god or trying to get him to do it this way or trying to get hay guards involved trying to get all kind of things and we can get down to looking at what we are in our day remember those in the bible that mounted to anything those in the ages coming down the mountain to anything was the people that believed the promise of god amen they believed the revelation come from god amen can you actually say that you believe what the prophet says on season on there with a shock when he brings it down from hagar and a doubt and says that's luther he brings it to wesley and the the the pollen you know or what you call it the coming forth and he brings it to mary as representing pentecost he said but a seed ain't come yet you want a little bit at least you can cover for seed you say but all the scripture is fulfilled just remember your prophet on spoken word is the original seed he gets down to telling the story of what i'm talking about and he thinks malachi 4 has already been fulfilled he thinks the seals had done been priests because he preached them you know one service yeah but he preached it and he gets over in there and he says lord what am i going to do i've got them out on a limb where do i go we see the great one to come forth the last is azusa street pentecost and said there's mary that the word is in her but he says where do i go and remember what he says he says as of yet the holy spirit spoke through the prophet he wrote it down that as of yet malachi 4 is not fulfilled about a prophet that thinks that he's already preached the entire word and yet god says malachi 4 is not fulfilled he knew that was the seed of malachi 4. so what was he to do go to planting that seed maybe even thinking as he would say sometime if i'm not him somebody's coming let me be the one to lay the foundation right he was a human being but then he begins to realize because he goes right through the message and i wish you would take that message of the spoken word original seed and do something sometime when you get a chance reading and look at what the lord told him pick up your pen and write and go back to page one and start over again and see if that's not exactly what he had already done god picks up right where he started in the message read it sometimes come on he starts right in where the prophet is bringing his message as to what this is to be this is to be this says but as of yet malachi 4 is not fulfilled well there was a seed that had not been planted there was a word that had not been made manifest and there was a group of people that had not come on the earth in the time to manifest that but you and i are that people i want to take my journey and put it with the journey of sarah see that i've had doubts and frustrations and problems how about you but yet in the end sarah saw that the promise that he made with abram when he come out of the land of her childish and just met him a little while later then and she says you know what i'm going to give birth to the baby that he got the promise of 40 years ago or something how long it was before then i'm going to give birth to that promise i think it's about time for you and i to realize that we didn't make the book we didn't write the story if you understand what i'm got written down here remember sarah had a journey also and without sarah then abraham could not have had the child because god had already said it was going to come through he just didn't tell them he's already told who this is coming through so sarah through faith instead of just by faith she took a journey god knew the promise genesis 17 verse 19 where he promises it to come through sarah so the promise was to sarah no no no no now the promise was abraham he can't get it done without sarah no he could go get him two or three more wives finally he'd get one oh no no god's predestinated plan before the foundation of the world that sarah was going to have that child and there was no way to change it god's promise there's going to be an end time bride that will be the word made flesh and he can't change that because he's already said it you say work through the prophet he said she'd be the fullness of the godhead bodily right come on then where are we at see god looked down now follow me god looked down in the life of sarah and was following her just like he was following abraham abraham's got problems sarah's got problems god don't have no problems right he knew what he was going to do it couldn't have happened but hagar could have married 14 other women and they don't but there's no type for him so there's no place to put him so he didn't have him polygamy was illegal in that day but god looked down and saw the problems of abraham and sarah but once he writes of them in hebrews 11 he mentions nothing about their problems right and you mean to tell me that we think hebrews 11 40 says that they without us cannot be made perfect what are we doing but abraham he gives sarah away two times god keeps it from it we were discussing this with a brother the other day and i hope don and him will take it to him because i'll give these scriptures where he can do it and this brother was talking about abraham and sarah and he said yes said nursera what said she went into that man and become his wife i said huh couldn't have touched it couldn't have touched him there was no way if abraham were to give sarah away every other day there was no way that they could have touched her now you know what i mean right because the promise was made god was protecting we talk about that he was protecting sarah in the basis that she was abraham's wife and that's true but he was protecting his promise you know let's think about sarah a little bit go ahead with number three and just make sure you get these scriptures so that you'll understand abraham give his wife away twice first time he goes to egypt gives his wife away down in egypt he deals with his wife and said tell them that you're my sister wrote it on that look brother was reading this and she was taken into pharaoh's house that's true that's true she was taken into pharaoh's house but he didn't touch her uh-uh keep reading why says thou she is my sister so i might have taken her to me to wife your scripture is plain and give that to the brother see i might have taken her to be my wife god protected her you say oh no god no abraham and his lying was covering his neck right god was protecting sarah told that king it's a good thing you've done what you've done you remember what brother random said on marriage and divorce he said it was a law even among the heather and that you didn't take a man's wife to be your wife because he said that was a law even among heathers so here in this scripture he's in egypt now go to the next one remember now the scripture genesis 12. he's going to egypt pharaoh genesis 20. an abram journey friends toward the south country and dwelt between cades and sir and journeyed in koran and abraham said to his wife she is my sister instead of his wife and emily's king of girl went and took sarah but he never lived with her no read the rest of his scripture but brought it back down but abraham ambulatch had not come nearer to her and he said lord will god slay also a righteous nation give him those two scriptures brother jesus two times but two times god is protecting his promise are you with me he's not going to let that king touch her even though she's a beautiful woman and if you'll check it which i did one time and kept running it back till i found it sarah was 65 years old when they went down into egypt the first time that he gave her away she must have been a beautiful woman he said well they lived longer back then well you got a point but that's till the point is she was up close to 65 years old because calculate your time when you're coming over for or that you're going with hagar coming forth and how old abraham was and the thing you'll find she was about 65 years old when he gave her away the first time but the second time he gave her away after she had been turned back to a young woman and abraham had been turned back to a young man abraham has many contacts with god personal meets melchizedek all kinds of things but yet he's got a little problem you know what he's human right you know god don't look at us as human too much we should never make a promise to him that we don't intend to keep but just remember if he made a promise to you you can't get out of the promise are you telling me that i'm telling you you show it to me in the bible and i see it if he makes a promise to you you're going to come to that place he said brother dale how do you feel standing today in the first sermon you preached in 1969 was it the bride of jesus christ would be the son of man the word made flesh i feel great i've been through a lot of doubt and there's been a lot of thomas in the way i don't know about you i'm just honest enough to admit it had a lot of problems a lot of heart aches and troubles but he's never failed to keep his promise he won't fail on that even though you may have doubts frustrations you know you ought to sometimes take the life of hagar and you remember when she's run off and still these say run things you know god finds her under a tree you know god's still dealing with hagar you know why because she represents justification come on are you listening she had a representation and he's taking care of her and taking care of his word because he said ishmael will be a great nation many kings shall come forth from him and he's going to keep his promise right think about it because of the promise sarah come through and brought forth the child see my point is that sarah became a believer in the promise that god made to abraham but you know what by making it to abraham he made the promise to her he just finally tells them well you know i think church is about time we believe this prophet's message quit looking at her ups and downs and problems and heartaches and troubles and get down to business number seven if you can jump over that face every who's running it paragraph 168 through 171 number seven in your notes hey they're getting better on it and i wrote it up jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever look so has sarah typed church today called out out of sodom with a waiting promise of a coming son sarah is the type of you and i but just remember sarah threw faith she finally achieved what maybe some others that were super duper by faith abel by faith this one by faith that one but you know after a while sarah catches on that there's a journey going on and she's part of the journey and that god is going to use her i think it's about time you and i caught on to that church and you know what now go back to what it said if the promise was promised to come through sarah then there's no way that abraham could have died and went on or any problem because you had to have him because in him and her that's verse 12 counted the promise you know see time together put them together put abraham and sarah together in verse 12. it talks about him what the promised seed brother branham says sarah looked and saw she saw it the promise fulfilled you know what that means there's going to be a bride in the end time that was represent that that was representative and then there is no form no placing it other than with the the seeds not able to shuck in the prophet's message because you'd wind up with a zeus street representing mary and you stop there and you hear the wonderful preaching of the preachers of this message i'm not throwing off on it i said wonderful and they talk of luther wesley and pentecost justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost and it's beautiful but how many of you ever heard really tell you the real truth and brought it down to where we're at and to see there's got to be another step after the baptism of the holy ghost because you've got to have the holy ghost himself the prophet said coming down upon the people the word is going to be made flesh well like i said while ago we take one side okay the word's going to be made flat let's find out all he said don't do and we won't do it that would be your own self-righteousness let's find all he said do and we'll try to do that that wouldn't take it anywhere i'm going to make a bold statement so swallow good i'd rather follow the life of sarah and see that yet in the doubts and the problems and heartaches she came forth as a believer in the promise same promise part of it right it said no it's gonna rain same promise that enoch you can walk off the earth same promise that said abel offer blood it's all still in the same journey the journey of a christian and to find our journey and what our day is to not just part of the word come forth but the word to be made manifest in our day well brother dale all you talk about is word word word well now you tell me what to talk about i mean if it ain't talking about the word what are you talking about but yet people shout over the stories and the things and wind up with mary having the word within her and finally giving birth right mary gave birth to the word right but remember the word is what we're talking about the seed it shall not be air with the shock all of that's got to die and fall away and we're going to come forth as the bride of jesus christ that's it even though we have a lot of faults and failures and a lot of troubles and problems but god didn't make the promise to me of salvation if i would be good he didn't tell me that he told me that he'd already paid the price well why can't i be like sarah through faith walk in the journey and be what god wants me to be take one step at a time don't take a big long run you're gonna fall and get hurt don't try to figure it all out just walk a step at a time follow the blueprint right and just walk into it god wasn't looking at the life in a sacral no more than he was wasn't looking at the life of abraham he wasn't looking at none of their unbelief he never recorded it he didn't record it in the new testament abraham gave his wife away twice he didn't record that he had this doubt in that doubt now he said he's staggered not god don't look at your problems and my problems we are the ones that look at the problems why don't we just give them to him come on brother why don't we just give him our problems and say lord if i'm going to be a sarah i'm going to have a lot of problems maybe a little doubt along the way maybe not a lot of understanding but i'll just do what i can and walk as i can because it's a journey each day is a journey we can make it a wonderful one or we can make it a problem see just believe what do we got brother 596 let's stand together i feel the poor what page number what page and my mind is it must be i hear the call i know his fear is moving me to give my all he speaks to me lord please come and take control and i begin to cry and my mind just fails to know exactly why i it must be god hearing my soul you ever do that at night you ever wake up in the middle of the night and just think about it and just lay there and pray then i can walk into it just come and take control please and think about what he's saying i went to hear the word and with my he was drawing me to live a higher i know for sure deeper we don't think about the contact abraham what do you think to give my all father we depend upon you because you're the only one and now you come on the scene and manifest yourself can we just lay this into your hands knowing that you will make it manifest for us because you promised it and we believe you in jesus name anybody else think about it he needs you to come on the scene into his heart and life to quicken them you'll see the word opening to it and you'll see the hour that we're living in the times of what's going on we condemn us any spirit that would be in any hindrance of trying to get our brother trying to come to this place of faith to see his own self in thy word because that's what we desire in jesus name what about it there's a deep call to the deep like a great magnitude i know for sure that i'll reach the goal in the name of jesus christ our sisters come for others desiring lord protection for the sisters flying home this this week lord can you just be with him and give a safe journey lord and we ask that you be with brother dick our lord and touch him we love you and we thank you in jesus name anybody else should have a need do you desire to be closer to the lord but what did the prophet say pray read your bible that's what he said so may we pray read the message in the bible our sister's going in tomorrow to have all this correction done that there's a tumor there and we just ask you lord to take that tumor away before they have to do any think of what they're doing we believe you we thank you we love you lord and jesus is your name this remembers the promise remember it's a promise read the bible as a promise to you it's not a promise to somebody else or whatever that's wonderful promise to yourself just down there and touch them father and restore everything back to normal where there won't be any trouble with it hurting and things we condemn it in the name of jesus christ anybody else lord prepare me to be your sanctuary you love him with thanksgiving are you sing it up to him and just think about him lord we love you thank you for the promises that you've made unto us and thank you for the understanding of that promise that how it pertains to us there's to be a group of people to make manifest your word and lord give us the faith the believing the understanding to see that we're part of it and help us to walk our end lord and bless us bless the people on the way home take care of everybody lord just give us safe journey in jesus name you're dismissed remember the brother coming sunday to minister unto us and just pray that the lord would open our understanding not of thy word lord amen you're just there's a blessed time that's coming coming soon maybe evening morning or at noon the wedding of the bride united we shall see the king
