[0:00] and remember if you ever reference
[0:02] anything that that we teach or taught on
[0:06] we reference the old book but the
[0:08] paragraphs are always the same
[0:10] the page numbers are not the same okay
[0:12] that one's about three pages off because
[0:15] they used either bigger part of smaller
[0:16] formal anything but the paragraph
[0:18] numbers are always yeah well you know
[0:27] what though if you buy a machine and
[0:29] then it got upgraded to we're now in a
[0:30] computer to fit it in so many pages its
[0:34] money really more than anything to keep
[0:36] from having a volume that big now they
[0:38] can condense it to lab they say back to
[0:40] paper so yeah no that's that's Carly
[0:43] goes down to a cost thing everything
[0:44] goes down all right let's turn to
[0:50] Philippians 2 Fennell where we were at
[0:54] we've been so long since we had just
[0:55] I've been down here so let's start good
[1:01] now night and today yes ma'am and
[1:04] congratulate them because she is with
[1:06] child he's gonna have a baby we kiss on
[1:10] the team all right so let's get here to
[1:20] where we're talking now and he's going
[1:22] through the book of Philippians and then
[1:23] when we get done we're gonna start with
[1:25] the Book of Revelations that's what we
[1:26] wanted to do right okay we'll start
[1:28] through the book of Revelation and that
[1:30] may take a while but that's okay do all
[1:33] things let's go to chapter 2 verse 14
[1:35] with the other here on the board do all
[1:38] the things without murmuring and
[1:39] disputing now what is Paul doing Paul is
[1:41] talking to the people in Philippi are
[1:43] the Philippians and he's exhorting them
[1:47] as Christians that you may be blameless
[1:51] and harmless the sons of God
[1:53] without review in the midst of a crooked
[1:56] and perverse nation so he was standing
[1:57] there in the midst of a crooked em for
[2:00] first day Ali thank you brought you back
[2:03] pack leader
[2:05] yeah
[2:09] so now among whom you shine as lights in
[2:14] the world
[2:14] so as the eternal word have died hey
[2:17] baby
[2:18] as the eternal Word of God we see that
[2:21] we do the same thing now but you may be
[2:24] blameless and harmless the sons of God
[2:26] without rebuke in the midst of a crooked
[2:28] and perverse nation among whom ye shine
[2:30] as lights in the world so that's you now
[2:33] today I love the eternal quality of the
[2:35] word it can be written 2,000 years ago
[2:37] and still apply directly to us today
[2:40] all right holding forth the word of life
[2:43] yet I may rejoice in the day of Christ
[2:46] that I have not run in vain neither
[2:48] labored in vain no once he said he has
[2:51] brought these people to Christ and he
[2:53] has not labored in vain because he's
[2:55] going to be he's going to be connected
[2:59] with as brother branham went across the
[3:01] curtain of time and he was connected
[3:02] with all those people across the current
[3:04] town they said we're resting on that but
[3:06] what brother brown said they came in
[3:08] receiving the new birth and received the
[3:10] message it was put in the sixth
[3:12] dimension so same way with Paul neither
[3:16] labored in vain that's the same way with
[3:19] you know you talk about I don't want to
[3:23] talk about it when you do you talk about
[3:25] people that that like brother Dale in
[3:27] different ones and have been 50 years in
[3:30] the message and you just he still holds
[3:31] fasting still any any any nursers all of
[3:34] us and here the church is growing now
[3:36] numbers don't mean anything but - you
[3:38] got to remember numbers do mean
[3:41] something you know to God God knows the
[3:44] number we don't but to be successful is
[3:47] is that brother Dale brings you to
[3:49] Christ not to him brings use of Christ
[3:51] and then Christ in you commune back and
[3:55] forth but it takes a fivefold ministry
[3:57] in between that to filter all the junk
[4:01] out in vultan you're done I don't know
[4:04] but I filtered our junk out and then
[4:06] turns us to the right path as we were
[4:08] talking last night about why God sent a
[4:10] prophet God sends prophets to watch
[4:12] steer us back to the Word of God not
[4:14] change the word but steer us back to the
[4:16] Word of God right so that's what brother
[4:18] Branham came for his sole purpose was
[4:20] not to get us saved no that's been
[4:24] happening since Christ - right
[4:26] he didn't come tell us how to dress
[4:27] that's already been printed in the Bible
[4:30] for 1500 years he didn't tell us all
[4:32] those things that people thought for 50
[4:34] years people didn't trying to get us to
[4:36] be legalist right no that's not it roll
[4:40] around for message came to bring us to
[4:42] Christ and if he'll bring you to Christ
[4:44] I said yup that's question for you if
[4:47] he'll bring you to Christ then you'll
[4:49] know where he stood as a prophet and
[4:50] you'll understand that the words he
[4:52] spoke was God's words to us to line us
[4:54] back up only when he called Lucien's the
[4:59] doctrinal issues not the doctrine issues
[5:01] of Herod dreads know what about give
[5:03] them all those things the other had to
[5:05] be brought back but he his message was
[5:08] to bring us to a place of perfection a
[5:10] body change a place to where we don't
[5:12] have to die a place to where this
[5:14] message becomes so alive in you that is
[5:16] just like Jesus Christ walking to the
[5:17] face of the earth and we got to believe
[5:19] that
[5:22] amen we've gotta say I had my father on
[5:24] one okay and we come from God and we'd
[5:28] go back to God remember John 17 Jesus
[5:32] said I pray thee that they may be one as
[5:34] you and I are one so if Jesus and the
[5:36] father were one person we got to connect
[5:39] to that right and that didn't happen
[5:42] down through the ages because what man
[5:43] had took little little tip tidbits a
[5:46] little snippets and they said oh this is
[5:47] this is father son Holy Ghost baptism
[5:50] there is an eternal hell there is a so
[5:53] it took going to bring the property to
[5:54] line back up just like in Paul's day it
[5:55] took a property to bring from the Old
[5:57] Testament so that's all Paul had
[5:59] remember Paul was riding the New
[6:01] Testament he didn't read the New
[6:03] Testament he was riding that he was
[6:04] riding it though from the Old Testament
[6:06] that he took in God what through the
[6:09] filter of the Holy Ghost that was in
[6:10] Paul took the Old Testament running
[6:12] rupaul and then he made the New
[6:14] Testament and as we said last night
[6:16] we're coming up to New Testament in my
[6:17] blood
[6:19] Paul could die Paul died but he didn't
[6:21] die for anybody Jesus Christ died for it
[6:24] something black doctor he died for me I
[6:26] don't know if he died for you but he
[6:27] died for me right now what we're talking
[6:31] about taking the communion last night a
[6:32] question that the kids had yeah and if
[6:35] I'd be offered upon the sacrifice and
[6:38] disturbance of your faith I joy and
[6:41] rejoice with you all for the same cause
[6:43] also do we join and rejoice ye joy and
[6:48] rejoice with me
[6:49] but I trust in the Lord Jesus to send
[6:51] Timothy Shortland to you that may be of
[6:54] no be a good comfort when I know your
[6:57] state Paul wasn't following it Paul
[7:01] worried about the people you want make
[7:03] sure the people knew what he was talking
[7:04] about because he and that's why saying
[7:07] we were in Brenham same way with Jesus
[7:09] Christ he kept saying repeating itself
[7:11] brother Graham kept saying you know
[7:13] these doctrinal issues all the way
[7:15] through that we understand them for I
[7:17] have no man like-minded who will
[7:20] naturally care for your state in other
[7:22] words look for all seek their own not
[7:26] the things which are Jesus Christ Paul
[7:28] knew there was grievious wolves getting
[7:30] ready to come in I've been reading that
[7:31] the book of Acts the Grievous wolves was
[7:34] gonna come in and do what tear his
[7:36] doctrine down just like they're done
[7:37] brother Randall doctor no tearing at
[7:39] them but you know the prison theme that
[7:41] as a son with the father he has served
[7:45] with me and the gospel so much mm same
[7:47] way you know him therefore I hope to
[7:49] send presently so soon as I shall see
[7:52] how it will go with me he's in members
[7:55] and Philip on but I trust in the Lord
[7:57] that I also myself shall come shortly to
[8:00] the people again I suppose it necessary
[8:03] to send you to sent you if that
[8:05] frittatas EE PAP Road itís my brother
[8:10] and companion in labor and fellow
[8:11] servant fellow soldier but you mentioned
[8:14] during he that ministered to my ways now
[8:16] this is no remember this is the letter
[8:17] Paul's writing so he's having to write
[8:19] the letter with the content for he
[8:21] longed after you all and was full
[8:23] because that he had heard that he had
[8:26] been sick for indeed he was sitting on
[8:29] to death but God had mercy on him and
[8:30] not on him only but on me also that's
[8:33] not good enough sorrow upon sorrow I
[8:36] sent him there for the more careful that
[8:38] when you see him again you may rejoice
[8:40] too now maybe the less sorrowful receive
[8:45] him therefore in the Lord with all
[8:47] gladness and hope suction reputation
[8:48] same way with you another because for
[8:51] the works of Christ he was nine to death
[8:52] not regarding his life to supply your
[8:54] lack of service toward me all right
[8:57] Chapter three finally my brother because
[9:00] I think this is we've got two more
[9:01] chapter finally my brother rejoice in
[9:03] the Lord to write the same things to you
[9:06] to me indeed is not Grievous but for you
[9:08] it is safe I I take these writings of
[9:12] Paul now truthfully there's no way
[9:15] brother man wrote the Bible if you add
[9:20] or take away all right the plagues are
[9:23] there or your like names taken out of
[9:25] the book Paul was commissioned to do
[9:27] that so we have to look and see to write
[9:30] the same things to you brother Branham
[9:32] wrote us eleven hundred sermons our God
[9:34] did through brother Graham brought us
[9:36] eleven hundred sermons for us to study
[9:38] and not turn to the man like most doing
[9:41] something but to turn to God okay cuz
[9:44] that was the voice of God in the in our
[9:46] day just like Paul but now remember
[9:49] Paul's Commission was I run this race
[9:52] I'm coming to the end of my race I have
[9:56] fought a good fight a crown of life was
[9:59] laid up for me he knew he was gonna have
[10:00] to die and I think at some point brother
[10:03] Brown knew he was gonna have to go off
[10:04] the scene because people were look what
[10:07] they were doing they were baptizing in
[10:09] his name they were saying he was God and
[10:11] I promise you one thing God's not gonna
[10:13] share the glory with nobody not even
[10:16] William Branham I'm gonna share his
[10:18] glory but now when William Branham doing
[10:20] it it was the people around him same way
[10:21] with Paul I remember in acts
[10:27] Paul and Barnabas Barnabas went to Mars
[10:30] healed or something I believe it was and
[10:32] they were preaching in the power
[10:33] God was there and they called him
[10:35] Jupiter and some Greek guys you know
[10:39] because they were doing such great
[10:40] exploits well now that's not ice exactly
[10:44] what happened in the end time you know
[10:46] they made brother Brennan with God
[10:47] because of the things he does but Paul
[10:49] rebuked him and told him no that's not
[10:50] what happened
[10:51] he was just a like-minded just like you
[10:54] he's not Grievous but to you it is safe
[10:57] beware of dogs that doesn't mean puppies
[11:01] it doesn't mean Rottweilers and Bulldogs
[11:04] that means that Rottweilers and Bulldogs
[11:07] called demons right be aware of evil
[11:10] workers beware of the concision in that
[11:13] word means mutilation about that well
[11:18] you know what that's what's happening
[11:19] now people are mutilating the message
[11:21] they're cutting the peen cutting the
[11:23] pieces cutting it apart
[11:24] yeah and look they're not burning bugs
[11:27] turn on cutting books up they're cutting
[11:30] people to the soul they're cutting the
[11:33] soul of the people up and of course I
[11:36] just want to make this one statement if
[11:38] you're not grounded in God you'll be cut
[11:39] up uncle if you're not you act you will
[11:44] be you will be deceived because the
[11:46] elect cannot be deceived but everyone
[11:49] else will be saved
[11:50] all right so just make sure the elect
[11:55] your delay but we are the circumcision
[11:59] I'm not talking about physical which
[12:02] worship God in the spirit and rejoice in
[12:04] Christ Jesus and have no confidence in
[12:05] the flesh though I might also have
[12:09] confidence in the flesh
[12:10] hmm if any other man think that he hath
[12:13] whereof he might trust in the flesh I'm
[12:15] more watch why what's he saying
[12:18] circumcised the eighth day of the stock
[12:20] of Israel of the tribe of Benjamin don't
[12:23] over Paula from commitment absolutely
[12:26] tells you right now Hebrew the Hebrews
[12:29] as touching the law a Pharisee
[12:34] what's this concerning zeal persecuting
[12:37] the church to me that's a great a great
[12:43] God that knows how to use somebody
[12:44] because here's Paul Paul was the
[12:48] greatest persecutor of the church there
[12:49] ever was in the beginning no one had the
[12:53] zeal to try to destroy Christians as
[12:55] Paul did or so this all goes down on the
[12:59] road and God strikes him down and you
[13:02] know the story now I wouldn't Paul's
[13:04] conversion that's what we're going about
[13:05] last night you think boy that was Paul's
[13:07] conversion no that went Paul's
[13:08] conversion Paul get knocked off the
[13:11] horse because God told him they led him
[13:14] to the city but life had to come from
[13:16] the body from an eyes and the gun
[13:19] appears damn nice and said you need to
[13:21] go down there and and and I'm sure how
[13:24] nice was like Lord he said the Bible is
[13:26] the Lord that's all you want me to go
[13:31] ahead and lay hands on him he's been
[13:32] laying hands on us but it ain't been
[13:33] good Lord says remember that he had
[13:37] damned I said and the Lord said he's my
[13:39] chosen vessel but you've got to go lay
[13:43] hands on me to get him scaled up his
[13:45] eyes and to receive the baptism of the
[13:47] Holy or save the whole adopted group
[13:49] Damascus he just got knocked off his
[13:51] horse he just got turned in the right
[13:53] direction where he could see God because
[13:55] he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees his
[13:57] life was perfect mm-hmm
[14:00] concerning zeal persecuting the church
[14:05] touching the righteousness which is in
[14:08] the law blameless but what things were
[14:14] gain to me those I counted loss for
[14:16] Christ so all that three two persons
[14:19] that flew there Paul counted them as
[14:22] he's standing in another scripture dumb
[14:24] okay
[14:27] yay doubtless then I count all things
[14:30] but loss for the excellency of the
[14:32] knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for
[14:35] whom I have suffered the loss of all
[14:36] things and do count them but dung there
[14:40] we are
[14:40] that I may win Christ networth there's
[14:44] rubbish or when we say done we know what
[14:47] that means
[14:48] then I may win Christ and be found in
[14:51] him not having my own righteousness
[14:53] because verse 5 6 and 7 he was filling
[14:56] the Seldon I'm not really but he was
[14:58] telling you that if anybody's righteous
[14:59] I'm righteous be anybody's perfect I'm
[15:02] perfect according to the law that's what
[15:08] we see in the Maxie for them because
[15:09] everybody goes through that well I've
[15:11] never cut my hair of never cut you know
[15:13] I'm never I've never like I always said
[15:15] about the laundry list you got that
[15:17] laundry list up on them
[15:18] refrigerator I've never I've done that
[15:23] don't mean nothing pulses it's dumb
[15:24] water doesn't throwing trash cans
[15:27] till he does you no good how many times
[15:30] do we sing and we were talking yesterday
[15:34] so called what we think grounded and
[15:37] settled message girls what's the first
[15:39] thing they do you know they don't have
[15:41] the baptism all the DOS I gonna cut
[15:42] their hair and they're gonna wear pants
[15:43] they're gonna put oh my god hmm so the
[15:48] title message girl is they're real loose
[15:51] from you that weren't here yesterday one
[15:54] of the questions was why are worthy
[15:58] girls more friendly to you the message
[16:00] girl well number one I said well
[16:03] probably because if she's a real true
[16:06] message girl which there is no you
[16:08] either born again or not if you're
[16:10] living a hound dog life she ain't gonna
[16:12] pay attention to you anyway a worldly
[16:15] girls got another intention she's gonna
[16:17] be friendly to you because she has other
[16:18] intentions but message girls to reach
[16:22] out you know do things know better stay
[16:25] out of my life girl you don't problem
[16:27] that window crisp yes she reach out in
[16:31] the spirit of christ and not be like I'm
[16:35] better than you you don't talk about
[16:37] yeah but when you got a worldly got
[16:39] hound in here well that wasn't a
[16:42] question the question was
[16:44] girl oh yeah it was written by a guy
[16:48] okay I know that yeah but it was a guy
[16:51] call they said dating I hope it ain't a
[16:53] girl yeah it's all contactor what's
[16:59] going on here and let me make sure that
[17:02] we understand this on the internet it's
[17:04] it was a question that was asked about
[17:07] date could pretense was is I want to
[17:12] date worthy girls because they're more
[17:14] friendly than message girls and I do the
[17:17] message in quotation because there is no
[17:19] such thing as a messy girl you're either
[17:21] born again you're not you're on the
[17:22] world of God lunatic so so that was the
[17:28] whole thing was his can I date men of
[17:30] worldly girls would it be okay I think
[17:32] the question is part of that was is it
[17:34] okay right a little bang Kalyan you know
[17:37] she's way back in a bad box here
[17:38] eyebrows jewel above her glasses so but
[17:42] you know we've seen this that's why
[17:44] we're trying to get the young people to
[17:46] see that we've already seen this years
[17:48] and years of going to youth camps and
[17:50] seeing the same people have the same
[17:52] issues and then they go to the altar and
[17:55] that crime they spit and they spew and
[17:57] everything else you understand what I'm
[17:58] saying bro ground means it's not you
[18:00] know they snot all over the place and
[18:02] then the next year you see them or the
[18:03] next year you don't see them at all
[18:05] because they're gone right so you get a
[18:09] real birth let's put them grounded in
[18:11] the Word of God and and they were valid
[18:14] questions that they asked I mean that
[18:16] was a valid question we're going to
[18:17] cover it more in depth the next use
[18:20] Bible study because I want people to
[18:22] realize no you should not date worldly
[18:25] girls you'll get yourself in real
[18:27] trouble but if you're not a born-again
[18:31] believer you're going to date horribly
[18:33] girls because there's nothing in you to
[18:35] hold you you got to have the new birth
[18:37] to hold you and then you can sure you
[18:40] can witness to anybody but remember
[18:43] brother Rousey you don't go out there I
[18:44] thought it was a girl
[18:46] no I said dating but no you don't go out
[18:50] there see brother hamster don't you say
[18:51] okay I'll go to church with you to about
[18:53] detergent and you come with me to
[18:54] messenger if he said don't do that
[18:56] he said you be salty and let him come to
[18:58] you because if you go out there guess
[19:00] where you're going you're going out
[19:03] there hmm all right so you stay right
[19:05] here
[19:06] and say hey buddy you want to date me we
[19:08] come to church you want to you want to
[19:10] date I promise you three days a week 10
[19:14] o'clock two o'clock Sunday instead one
[19:17] o'clock Wednesday afternoon you want to
[19:19] date me those are prepaid you'll get me
[19:21] three times
[19:22] you know but it's gonna be in the church
[19:23] environment because if you don't if you
[19:27] step out and we've all done it
[19:29] okay so we walk we're not all so
[19:31] sheltered that's why I say I don't like
[19:35] message girls I bet this I mean you put
[19:40] a picture up and what's the message girl
[19:42] look like you put the picture up but but
[19:45] what the devil does excuse me if he's
[19:46] not born again the devil just takes that
[19:49] outside line and he goes and she's got
[19:51] on a pair of pants she should cut her
[19:53] hair she's wearing makeup behind that he
[19:55] understand behind that he pulls the real
[19:57] veil off and there's the person standing
[20:00] there because you know as well as I do
[20:02] we've seen people that we've tried to
[20:05] beat into it you can't you just got to
[20:08] be salty you got to show them because
[20:11] they're watching you they're watching
[20:13] every move you make you tell divaldo
[20:20] a girl like the laundry that you know
[20:23] growing up and something has has really
[20:27] been made real to me is that sometimes
[20:30] when you are born are you we grew up in
[20:35] a message home department yeah sometimes
[20:39] that can be what like it's like I'm a
[20:45] better word and in a head of it you know
[20:47] because it's hard when you grow up not
[20:50] drinking not committing adultery not
[20:52] then it's hard earth to know cuz it you
[21:01] know you take for example a nunnery we
[21:05] look at the Catholic Church they put
[21:10] people in nunneries and they've got
[21:11] popes over I mean priest over there
[21:13] don't have wives and you see what's
[21:15] happened they become pedophile and they
[21:18] become prostitutes because they are so
[21:21] put into a sheltered environment but I
[21:26] don't want if I had a daughter I wasn't
[21:28] going to say alright nine for about two
[21:30] years you need to go out there and word
[21:31] on and see what's going on and then I
[21:33] know you'll be back well be careful be
[21:36] careful but you know what after they get
[21:38] a certain age and they get going out
[21:41] they gonna do it anyway they go find
[21:44] town I promise you good idea fraida did
[21:50] nothing you'll do you know Caitlin I
[21:52] don't know she still got that little
[21:53] halo on cuff her
[21:58] remember yesterday it was a problem that
[22:13] works what it is joining you don't know
[22:16] everything in the world right you don't
[22:19] have any God don't have grandchildren
[22:21] yeah yes son the daughter is there's so
[22:26] many people that's not freaked in the
[22:28] truth I mean I grew up in an environment
[22:33] sometimes that can be well you resent it
[22:39] because it's bounded in your so much and
[22:41] that's the way it was all of the source
[22:43] so nice you can say look it was pounded
[22:45] but it's yeah because though when you
[22:47] turn 18 who got married or went out in
[22:49] the world I mean mean you both all we
[22:51] all didn't we got over them me and Jim
[22:54] got married at 19 and 18 and we go
[22:56] coming to church just we didn't have an
[22:58] answer but we went you know because of
[23:01] our parents or whoever you know but
[23:05] that's why we tried to it this church we
[23:07] try to preach the Word of God let the
[23:09] Word of God do it not emotions not
[23:12] feelings not somebody's a cramming it
[23:15] down the throat had it done many times
[23:17] you know but like dad was talking about
[23:19] last night you take legalism I meant to
[23:22] mention last night most legalist that
[23:26] we're in this message I thought had
[23:31] adulterous issues though he's talking
[23:33] about you know people that talk legalism
[23:37] by the time their life come up in the
[23:41] later years you found out that they
[23:42] divorced their wife and made another
[23:44] girl and then they had this one and then
[23:46] they was doing this most of your legal
[23:48] is your pure legal expecially the ones
[23:50] that came from out there in this one
[23:52] state start with a name but look look at
[23:57] your life you look at the people's life
[23:59] when you come to the end of the road you
[24:02] look back and see that's what legalism
[24:05] did it turns you into free love that's
[24:07] what brother
[24:07] it turns that into free love it's hard
[24:10] to understand it's really a paradox
[24:12] because you think boy they don't yeah I
[24:14] want you to be a chaste virgin well
[24:16] you pound so much legalism in somebody
[24:21] well look Pope's are not supposed to
[24:24] have lines right it's well-known that
[24:27] five to six Pope's back in the back in
[24:30] the history of popes had women they
[24:34] weren't wives they were concubines and
[24:37] they had kids so the Pope had young uns
[24:39] see that's against everything that you
[24:41] hold or the world holds up the Pope to
[24:44] be so pure listen we're all human beings
[24:47] we're put on this earth for a purpose
[24:49] and that's the worship God but we have
[24:52] are allowed to live and that's why I
[24:53] think that the Catholic Church would be
[24:55] wrong when they told the priests they
[24:56] couldn't have no why because you're
[24:58] burning your own lust then they start
[25:00] messing with these boys now that ain't
[25:02] God but that's legalism every day you
[25:08] don't do all your that's what Paul was
[25:10] trying to tell everybody in the Old
[25:12] Testament it was wash the pie
[25:14] put it right here on a certain day of
[25:16] the year you know put your menorah here
[25:19] and light it certain times Paul was
[25:21] trying to say last night the tradition
[25:22] that we're we're trying to get away from
[25:24] that tradition and be found in him who
[25:27] Christ not in the law but be found in
[25:30] him not having my own righteousness
[25:31] which is of the law that's that laundry
[25:35] list I didn't do this I didn't do that I
[25:37] didn't do this or I don't do this I
[25:39] don't do that at all to this all right
[25:42] good listen folks without the new verb
[25:44] you will do one of those on that laundry
[25:47] list it's not three or four or five or
[25:48] six somewhere down the line and he's
[25:50] proving itself mount the anointed ones
[25:53] can go so far but it when it comes to
[25:56] living the Word of God the true Word of
[25:58] God they fall they find one little thing
[26:01] to get off of they find one little like
[26:03] Paul talks about grievious wolves and
[26:05] people that are coming in and and
[26:08] disrupting the Word of God
[26:09] listen I've told y'all for years the
[26:12] Baptist Earth do not care about the
[26:15] message they have their own thing the
[26:18] that this have their own thing now once
[26:20] once before Pentecost was kind of
[26:22] interlaced with the message down there
[26:24] over here
[26:25] so we're singular in ourselves and our
[26:29] greatest my greatest fear was is what
[26:32] apostasy from inside not apostasy from
[26:35] out there they're not gonna yeah I've
[26:37] got trouble us why and here we go again
[26:41] buster over here being a bad mr. na he's
[26:45] a little higher than baby's probably
[26:46] closer to kind of comfortable brother
[26:48] Buster are over here would do anything
[26:49] in the world to help us anything where a
[26:54] message brothers that don't agree with
[26:56] you and doctrine would rather see you
[26:57] guts burn literally right so show me you
[27:05] love God you understand what I mean but
[27:08] see anointed ones is it's just so much
[27:10] of a blanket now to where everybody's
[27:13] religious everybody can do this isn't it
[27:16] all right I mean you really it is yeah
[27:19] it's just the Word of God and the
[27:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost that the only
[27:24] thing that's gonna get us out of here
[27:26] that's it nothing else no longer let us
[27:30] know how long your dresses are no no
[27:32] that ain't it we wasted a lot of time
[27:36] all those years when we should have been
[27:37] digging into the Word of God so they
[27:39] would get to baby born and then they'd
[27:41] beat it to death
[27:42] there was numerous don't tell me don't
[27:44] don't no don't get me wrong there was
[27:46] new birth in all that but you got the
[27:49] baby it's like Caitlyn's gonna have a
[27:50] baby in several modern unless you know I
[27:52] hate much from now whatever it isn't all
[27:53] this she's gonna get the baby and we're
[27:56] all gonna go baby's here
[27:58] she's gonna thank God the baby's here
[28:00] you know and then they're gonna just
[28:02] take it and put it in the room of their
[28:04] house and shut the door and go well now
[28:06] that baby's in there and he's alive he
[28:09] Charlie
[28:10] Charlie's in there and he's alive we'll
[28:14] go back and check in in three months now
[28:18] that's the way the people in the message
[28:20] have been brought up we got the baby
[28:21] here we got the hair
[28:23] the grass well it may not have any hair
[28:25] we got some hair we got the grasp right
[28:28] we dress the baby we put it in the crib
[28:30] we put him a brand new Doc room but
[28:32] we're gonna go back to check on him in
[28:33] three months no debate he's gonna die
[28:35] and that's what happens babies have died
[28:37] in this magazine under didn't some don't
[28:40] some book Realty
[28:41] it's just always been the Word of God
[28:43] the Word of God is gonna do it okay
[28:45] where nothing else will stand the word
[28:48] of the understand you said well that is
[28:49] part of the Word of God you're right
[28:50] it's part if not all of it that's right
[28:56] you got to grow up you got to become a
[28:58] teenager you got them coming a dog you
[29:00] got to become a mat or Christian that's
[29:02] why we're still here floats I'm telling
[29:03] you that's why we're still here because
[29:04] we have the power brother after you got
[29:08] enough Holy Ghost in you to create a
[29:10] world and go live on and you do but a
[29:13] bar is holding it what bar you your
[29:16] what's holding it back because if God
[29:19] releases that power to you if we're not
[29:21] characterized by God we don't have that
[29:25] character first time somebody cut you
[29:28] off the highway you know kill that man
[29:34] you say it doesn't work look at Elijah
[29:37] Elijah had the power of God on him not
[29:40] in him
[29:40] but own him just like an anointed one
[29:43] because if a man is told he wouldn't
[29:45] kill him you and the columns the
[29:47] she-bears to eat the children but
[29:48] because him being a prophet God had to
[29:50] honor what he said and quickly he turned
[29:52] without character without character I'm
[29:56] sorry he didn't have believer so we
[29:58] didn't have any of these characteristics
[29:59] he turned curse the 42 children they
[30:03] died that's what you would do your boss
[30:07] you know your this and your head you
[30:10] name all these people that you want to
[30:11] get rid of well God's not gonna release
[30:14] that power until you're able to forgive
[30:15] them
[30:17] forgive them all not worry about what
[30:20] they've done to you Jesus Christ on the
[30:23] cross not worrying about what people
[30:24] don't do amen
[30:26] so that's what you have to do but I may
[30:29] know him what you know like this then I
[30:30] may know him and the power of his
[30:33] resurrection and the Fellowship of his
[30:36] sufferings being made conformable unto
[30:39] his death if by any means I might attain
[30:42] unto the resurrection of the Dead now
[30:46] see there's a lot of people will cover
[30:47] this just real quick then we'll go
[30:49] upstairs come on stop right there there
[30:56] come on this scripture right here if you
[31:00] look back in the history the people that
[31:04] were around Paul was preaching that the
[31:08] resurrection was gonna happen during
[31:09] Paul's time because he said that right
[31:12] there that I may attain unto the
[31:14] resurrection of the Dead Paul had to
[31:16] come back later on in another letter and
[31:20] because brother Graham covers this that
[31:22] everybody thought the resurrection was
[31:23] gonna have your palms a Paul says no no
[31:25] no wait a minute
[31:25] there's got to be this great falling
[31:27] away like Chris was in Galatians
[31:29] it's got to be this the resurrection is
[31:31] not gonna happen nearby huh it's going
[31:34] to happen at a later time but he let's
[31:37] see when he preached this other people
[31:39] took it and said well Paul's preaching
[31:41] into resurrection is coming right now
[31:42] see how good he'll misconstrued you can
[31:45] be if you don't have the Holy Ghost
[31:46] you'll be messed up when you see that
[31:48] and what is he talking about he's
[31:50] talking about an out resurrection in
[31:53] other words he was resurrected from the
[31:56] dead when he got the new birth you and I
[31:57] are a resurrected that's why we don't
[32:00] have to die again we'll never die again
[32:03] we may fall asleep but we'll never die
[32:06] you died when you receive the new birth
[32:08] your data your daddy Christ the dead in
[32:12] Christ shall rise first okay so that's
[32:15] what Paul's telling right here he's
[32:16] saying hey then I might attain unto the
[32:19] resurrection of the Dead and then people
[32:21] took it one time with your brother
[32:23] Brendan where do they get their false
[32:25] doctrines from in the message they gave
[32:27] you from the message
[32:29] you know open your Bible we know there's
[32:33] only one gun we know water baptism the
[32:36] name Lord Jesus cross we know there's no
[32:37] eternal hell we know all these major
[32:39] doctrines well the guy down the road in
[32:42] the Methodist Church he opened the same
[32:43] Bible preachers of Trinity preachers
[32:46] Warner baptismal name Father Holyoke
[32:47] uses the same Bible they don't change it
[32:49] it changed the revelation interpretation
[32:53] so the interpretation they got wrong but
[32:54] Paul's telling them later on in another
[32:56] epistle he says look we got to look for
[32:59] we got to look for a resurrection of
[33:01] this guy resurrect is sitting in
[33:03] heavenly places this guy not the
[33:06] physical guy but the physical guys are
[33:08] going to come up in a resurrection but
[33:10] it's not gonna happen right now but now
[33:12] listen it is now this is the time of the
[33:17] resurrection this is the resurrection
[33:19] message the Son of Man is the
[33:21] resurrection message because only the
[33:24] Son of Man resurrected amen so if we're
[33:27] under the Sun oh man ministry that's why
[33:29] everybody keeps hollering son of man son
[33:31] of man they don't know what they're
[33:32] talking about it's a resurrection
[33:34] message we got to get the dead Saints
[33:37] out of the ground first
[33:38] then we're changed then we go in the
[33:41] rapture there's a process so we have to
[33:44] preach the Son of man message so much as
[33:47] Jesus did when he said Lazarus come
[33:48] forth but it won't just be Lazarus this
[33:50] time with me everybody let's go do you
[33:53] ever watch okay all right let's go
[33:57] [Music]
[34:07] [Music]
