TRANSCRIPT
========================================
let's start off with a question and you don't have to say it just think think in your heart last time we were talking what what scripture did Brother Rand reference in his life story and this is a scripture he I think he preached his life story like four or five times and it's right there in Hebrews 13:10 to 14 now that's something to meditate on I I I like to encourage you to not just um come and listen on Sunday but when you go home open up your Bible and really um think about it why did Brother brandham use this scripture in his life story we have an altar where of they have no right to eat which serve the Tabernacle and we were talking about what that means last time for the bodies of those beasts the sacrifice was taken outside of the camp just like Jesus who was taken outside of the camp when he was sacrificed now crucified on the cross cross and for our sins and so Paul is saying now we got to go we got to follow Jesus outside the camp too bearing his reproach to be identified with him you think about Jesus carrying his cross outside of the camp and he's telling us take up your cross and follow me follow him outside of the camp outside of our own ideas and our thoughts and those kind of things so let's just go to the Lord and pray and prayer before we study Lord we thank you so much for your word that you've given into to us Lord to to give us encouragement and an answer for everything that we face every problem every challenge every struggle in life is the answer is laying here in your word and I pray God that you'll be with us today Lord as we study these things out this morning that you'll open our understanding of these scriptures Lord Jesus be with brother Wade as he's prepared and studying Lord and be with us today God that set our hearts and our minds in order Lord to receive what you have for us to lay our own will down to lay our own thoughts down lord and follow Jesus outside of the camp in your name we pray amen why would you want to do that why would you want to follow Jesus you catch the vision that here we have no continuing City this is not my home but my treasures are my treasures are somewhere else so much heartache and so much Despair and things in this life this ain't where our Treasures are we got a city that we're looking for where the Builder and maker is God but we seek one to come like Paul said now before we really get into the study I want just share some quotes from some some some some good oldfashioned theologians this first one is um uh from from Thomas Aus who was a a uh a a a minister in the 1400s during the Middle Ages and he wrote you can read this book The imitation of Christ it's got a some some Catholic heavy things in it about the Eucharist and um trinitarian doctrines and things like that um but there's some there's some excellent things in here I remember reading this when I was a young man that that that really kind of set my mind and and uh kind of really heavily influenced me about how that struggle uh suffering in life is is essential that God will allow you to go through things to bring you to a place where he can actually deal deal with you and and so there's some really really this this book was a a big influence on kind of the way the way that I view some things and so Thomas Aus he said all the evils in the world come from this that men do not know how to be content in their own chamber the one who has conquered his own self-will is greater than one who has defeated a thousand times a thousand men so we're talking about following Jesus outside the camp to die to your own self-will just like he died he gave up everything for us absolutely now that's kind of the mode that we're talking talking about as as we study this thing out and and another quote that maybe we'll Circle back to later is Martin Luther said the sin underneath all our sins is to trust the LIE of the serpent that we cannot trust the love and grace of Christ and must take matters into our own hands now if you've ever wondered what the LIE is that the serpent told Eve that sums it up the LIE is that you can't you can't really trust that he's the same yesterday today and forever you can't have confidence in him so you got to take matters into your own hands now you know sometimes as ministers we we kind of struggle on how to frame it up just right and you know I I I I've been kind of belaboring the point sometimes with your kids and things you got to take your hands off and that's a little bit difficult to articulate right cuz you don't you got to set a standard in your home you got to you know you you you can't let them get away with doing things they shouldn't whatnot but really the essence of the thing is we got to have trust faith that he's the same yesterday today and forever and when we really begin to doubt that we'll do like Eve and put our own will and our own hand to it because that's really the situation that Eve found herself in I don't believe that God is going to do it so I got to do it now that's that's the battle that's that's where really if you look at it the greatest evil is your self-will is when you put yourself and that's that the devil there in the garden he's influencing Eve he's influencing Eve to inject her own will into it and say I can't trust God anymore I got to do it now that's where that's where if you can lay your own self- will down and lay your own will down and do like Christ take up your cross and follow him then you can see God begin to work right so that's what Paul is saying in verse if you go on to verse 12 wherefore Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp bearing his reproach I got I got to follow Jesus outside the camp outside of all of the ideas of the day and my ideas outside of the camp to go to his Camp I want to be in his Camp I don't want to be in my camp and that's where that's where in every aspect of our life when you got a problem in your home with your children or with your wife or your husband sometimes we we we we forget that we've got a God that we can turn it to and we'll try to tackle things with our own will and our own ideas and you know maybe maybe maybe you just youve put your own will into your children so much until you're just badgering them constantly you need to be a Christian you need to be a Christian but remember you can turn to God in prayer and get down on your knees and with faith and watch God begin to move now that's that's the battle your will versus God's will for here we have no continuing City but we seek one to come now think now let's let's actually put ourselves in in the place of somebody following Jesus outside of the city Jesus you if you were behind him you'd see him struggling beating struggling to go out of the city going he got to go outside the gates now you got to go outside the gates too yes to to bear his reproach and all all of the you look around at people mocking him and and all the strange ideas of the Pharisees and Sadducees and they all had their different ideas and different doctrines and things now that's where we can get so caught up sometimes so so much of the Christian journey is like a mind battle and if you can frame up your thinking in the right way that our thinking that's that's why I was saying earlier it's not to be against everything but to be for Jesus yes we're following Jesus and you can start being now the reason why this is so important is because this is how this is how people look at things they'll see a young person go to camp and they'll get a real blessing and they come back and I I had an experience may maybe they didn't get born again but they had an experience they recognized God is real but because somebody's against going to camps that's what they're against same thing with with laying on of hands I was hearing a preacher preach about somebody in their Church came up they were uh they were struggling with cancer and they wanted somebody to pray for them and they come up to the preacher but because that church was against laying on of hands they were so strongly against laying on of hands that they told the sister to go back and go go sit down in your in your Pew where you came from it's because they in their mind they become so against everything that they forgot to be for something when you see when you see somebody getting a blessing be for it be I I'm for chains coming off I'm for somebody being delivered and you can begin to frame up you the way that you think so just like the Pharisees they were so against somebody being healed on or so against somebody doing anything on the Sabbath until when somebody was healed on the Sabbath that was how they framed up their world view and they were just I'm well I'm against that but what about what about being for somebody being healed or for somebody being delivered or for something good so as you follow Jesus outside of the camp we're not it's not that we're you know you can you there's so many strange doctrines there's so many things you can make a long list I'm against that I'm against that I'm against that I'm against that but if you're for Jesus all of those things will take care of themselves you just follow after Jesus because that that scripture we keep hammering on that that we got a promise that he will lead and guide us into all truth so you just keep your eyes on Jesus amen and all the things there's so many doctrines that you can list out I like the doctrine that irenius follow uh the gnosticism I can barely understand what even gnos what was irenius battling about it's such a complex Doctrine so you my point is you can make a list of all these things to be against but let's be for something for something is where you kind of you're optimistic that God is leading us and changing us or you can have that negative uh or finger pointing I don't like nothing I don't like anything and you're just against everything but I want to be for something so brother Bram said in going beyond the camps he said now watch what he says to do now in closing put out of the camp where the sacrifices was burned that's that's where he belonged he was the sacrifice amen now so the sacrifice the animal sacrifice was taken outside of the camp and it was burned so Jesus is the sacrifice now if you're going to follow him that means you have to sacrifice your own self-will too he was the sacrifice for you and now you got to lay down your own will and there's the struggle there's the struggle now now so brother Brown said and going beyond the camp he said now brother sister do you know that each one of you all must sacrifice now the Bible says that he's made us Kings and Priests and a priest is going to sacrifice you must be God's sacrifice sacrifice the things of the world sacrifice your own pleasures of this world sacrifice the things of the world you know the reason that people won't do it and he doesn't really answer that question outright but that's a good question to ask why do people are not why are not they willing to sacrifice I think if we could really answer that question that that would answer a lot of the questions that are posed in this day why well we're not asked brother Ram said we're not asked to manufacture something we're asked to Bear the fruit of the spirit that is the inside of the sheep what he is on the inside makes the wool on the outside and when a man has got Christ on the inside it makes him Christlike on the outside not some artificial put on so sacrifice sacrifices every every everything about our Christian Journey about the church it's all based on sacrifice if you want to see your children saved if you want to see some something real happen in their life then You' got to start with your own self to lay down your own self-will start cleaning up your house set an atmosphere in your home where your children can actually see God there and see God moving see signs and wonders following in your life make make them thirsty see them let them see you reading the Bible Bible and hear you praying in the dead of the night and actually see you living it because that's that's really the problem the problem is is where is the sacrifice people are not they're willing to point out faults and flaws and other people that they're really not willing to make a sacrifice and their own life and lay down their own will and try to get you know really get active about trying to get rid of things in their life the whole Christian journey is about sacrificing that's why in the in the Old Testament you look at like this diagram of the of Solomon's Temple and everything was about sacrifice that altar in the outer Court where they brought an animal and sacrificed it then that that H that the in the Holy place the the where the priest would would offer up incense he'd bring in uh all all of the things there everything was about laying something down and giving something up you know there maybe a line of people however long wait to bring their sacrifices every day peace offerings and sin offerings and things because they're coming to lay something down and it it's all about sacrifice and so when PA Paul says in Hebrews 13:15 he says by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name and in verse 16 but to do good and to communicate forget not for with such sacrifices God is well pleased he's talking about sacrificing and see some some sometimes we're we're so caught up in oursel that we forget to praise God and thank God and acknowledge Him for for giving us a job even before we eat we bow our head and thank God for even giving us food on the table and all those things are sacrifice it's a sacrifice when you lift your hand up in church or when you say Amen to the preacher because you're sacrificing your own will maybe maybe in you're sitting here you're embarrassed to be to be like different or you're embarrassed to say a men or be vocal about your appreciation of the word but all of those things are sacrifices and so it's the father in it suffices brother BR said now back to Cain and Abel when Cain worshiped he built an altar he sacrificed he worship God but that wasn't enough it was beautiful no doubt the flowers and things that grows in the field and he decorated his altar why soon as soon as Easter come across the Nations there'll be Millions dollars spent for Easter flowers that go on the altar well God don't care about that Easter flower on the altar he wants you on the altar you're the person for the altar not your flower or your money he wants you the altar was built for you to sacrifice your own will to his will now you really really I've been really meditating on this all week what good does it do like Cain to bring all of these nice things to come to church and have stained glass windows and all those things what's what was missing in K's life was sacrifice what good does it do to come to a church and say well I'm a good message believer and I I you know understand the doct when you're not willing to sacrifice what good does it do to say I'm a good Christian or whatever whatever if you're not willing to sacrifice and be honest and have integrity and be a upstanding Christian and deal with one another in the right way and lay down your own life so that some other some you know some somebody else can can benefit and and be good to one another what good is all these things what if you're not willing to sacrifice sacrifice the way that you think sacrifice your Doctrine for God am sacri when you go to to the to the pool and and are baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's a type you're you're laying down your own life and going down in the water and death to be raised up in newness of life because you're sacrificing your life to Christ you're sacrificing yourself and everything everything is a dying out that's why uh I I love this story that uh in the Bible of Jacob wrestling Ling with the angel and you really think about what what Jacob was doing when he was wrestling with the angel he's he's dying out to himself are these things that have been preached are they true are these things that I've heard that's why brother Brown when he was when he was preaching this in spir spiritual Amnesia he said I was with Jacob that night when he wrestled all night with the angel I've wrestled myself I know what he went through so I wrestled with Jacob the same time he did for I am his brother I I love how the the Bible is like a road map of your own life yes and when you begin to read the Bible like that you can identify yourself with these stories it it it it it's actually it's something Supernatural is happening you can look back in your life and say I I remember I remember when you know uh people mocked and scorned like David or you know I I remember I remember when I was on the ash sheep like job I remember when I prayed all night wrestled all night like Jacob did there at the river before he met Esau I remember and if you can remember and really identify yourself remember when remember when you died out and and that's the whole point maybe of this little Sunday school lesson God will bring us like Thomas Thomas AA said in the imitation of Christ he will bring you so low he will bring you to the bottom of the ash sheep he will bring you down so that you really die out like Jesus did In The Garden of Gethsemane he will bring you maybe he'll take away all your friends and make you feel like you're completely alone something horrible will happen to your life emotional turmoil and Trauma so that God can get you to where he can really begin to use you CU you've got to die out to your self-will and he can't use you if your self-will is still remaining you got to get rid of your self-will and and we don't get rid of our self- will I'm not going to get rid of my self-will because somebody's mean to me or hurtful it's because God God is doing the work God is doing it God is allowing things to happen in our life to mold us you think about all the all the horrible things that happened in Martin Luther's life and John Wesley's life brother brandom's life where he washed his F his wife and his daughter die and had that horrible sickness in Africa when when he disobeyed the Lord and all the thing to it's God bringing him to a place where he can really begin to use him cuz you got to take up your cross and follow him and brother Ram would say in questions and answers law having a shadow he said now now here's the question wouldn't you all like to have a real Bible Church a real Bible Church where all the spiritual gifts were set in order everything making manifest just exactly the way it should be wouldn't that be wonderful wouldn't that be wonderful now he's he's given the recipe now you're going to have to sacrifice not money you're going to have to sacrifice what some of your own ideas you're going to have to sacrifice some time in prayer yes sir you're going to have to sacrifice maybe a stubborn will to break down in humility you're going to have the whole Christian move is sacrificial and then he quotes that scripture he that will follow me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me daily is that right how often do you have to sacrifice every day Paul said he died daily every day he died so let's see let's see what we got a sacrifice we got five minutes left so I'm not really going to get in but I want to go through and really dive into the things that we've got to lay down because if you really can sacrifice oh then you'll have a church where God can move a church that will be in unity a church that will stand together a home that will stand together a family that will stand together in unity why because it's it's you're laying down you're laying down all these things that I'm about to cover brother R said oh Lord just once more he said the trouble of it is the church today is not like Samson they're not willing to pay the price now I I know maybe looking out this this might be be getting a little bit bored and everything but I'm telling you this is the secret this is the reason this is the reason why a lot of young people don't want the want the message this is the reason why you look around why why why are these things happening it's because there's a lack of sacrifice right that's right they're not willing to pay the price Samson prayed right when he prayed Lord let me die with the Enemy he knowed it was going to cost him something he know it was going to cost something it's going to cost you something it's going to cost me something your social prestige your place and position in the denomination Lord let me die then I see your purpose he knowed it was going to cost him something you must be ready to die out to your enemy to get in the blessings of God Samson was willing to pay the price to get the power of God again upon him he was willing to do it are you are you willing to sacrifice your television programs now see that's that's one of the problems with with young people in the church their CH their parents are not willing to sacrifice and get rid of all the all the anime and all the nastiness that their kids are watching they're just not willing to sacrifice and clean up the place and you know it used to be as wrong for us to go to the movies but now the devil put one over on you brought it right in the house with you that's right and not just in the house now but on our phones and on our watches and on our computers at work and on your computers at work and everything and and if we're not willing to sacrifice it will begin to have an effect on us and change our mind instead of the word so what do we sacrifice and you got to sacrifice your personal desires and self-will then said Jesus unto his disciples If any man will come after me let him deny himself and again in Matthew chapter 16 for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it it's about laying our life down yes we got to sacrifice our sinful behaviors and attitudes and Paul said in Romans he said for if you live after the flesh you shall die but if you through the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the body ye shall live we got to lay our lay our own our flesh down so much until it's like killing it so it has no effect on our life in Colossians he said mortify Therefore your members which are upon the Earth fornication uncleanness in ordinate affection evil concupisent and covetousness which is idolatry you know what Paul's really hitting at there is that you know we can come to church and have all these things laying there in our life and these things that he's listing are terrible and you think it's terrible but yet people will come to church with fornication and adultery and horrible things laying there in our life and actually think that they're born again and will not lay their life down and allow God to begin to move in their life now that's that's what the preaching of the Gospel is really to do to expose in your mind that you ain't Born Again people will battle it out and get upset with the ministry because he's calling it out but we're not here to to to you know hurt feelings but to see Soul's life the whole purpose of the of the church is to see somebody sacrifice themselves and accept the sacrifice that Jesus made that's why Paul's listing out all these things if we can if we can realize if we can realize that there's something lacking in our life and be willing to lay our own life down on our own ideas and accept what Christ has done Mor what's mortification of our Deeds mean self-examination search me oh God and know my heart is what David said in the Book of Psalms it means continual repentance every day to acknowledge what you've did WR constantly be examining yourself am I am I re am I do I really have the right motives do I really have the right objectives am I the problem and rely on the Holy Ghost now that's what Eve's problem was she forgot to trust in in God this I say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh is what Paul said in Galatians cuz if you're trusting in God and you're walking in the spirit and you're you're you're not letting your relationship with God go cold then your flesh will truly be mortified and seek to distance yourself from the world in Romans chapter 12 Paul said be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God and what he's saying here as we close up right here as we're running out of time he's saying when when you don't try to get as far away from the world as you can try to get as far away from the things of the world and anything that will distance yourself from God and get get close to God cuz he said if if you draw nine to me I will draw nine to you when you're so get so caught up in the world that you're not willing to lay your life down things just don't work right that's right God bless you Saints amen
