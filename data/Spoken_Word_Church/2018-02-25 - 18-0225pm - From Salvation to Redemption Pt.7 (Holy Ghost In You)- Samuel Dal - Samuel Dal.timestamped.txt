[0:09] good afternoon let me just share
[0:13] something right quick I have a little
[0:15] medley that I'm gonna do but us
[0:18] unlearned or untrained people of color
[0:21] tend to pounce all over the keys that's
[0:26] just the way we were raised our singing
[0:28] roots come from the plantation being on
[0:30] the field so we don't worry about it we
[0:32] just sing from the heart and from the
[0:33] zoom that's all so it creates quite a
[0:36] challenge for the musicians so with that
[0:39] being said I have a little old school
[0:42] and I believe in old school that's what
[0:43] brought brought us here and that will

[17:23] something so remember all of these and
[17:25] prayed to the Lord would bless huh like
[17:27] turning your scriptures turn where we've
[17:29] been reading in Jonah 2 and verse 9 and
[17:36] then we'll go from there to honesty I
[17:39] gave them one I'll start with the other
[17:41] one we'll go to John 14 father we thank
[17:47] you for this day in your grace we thank
[17:49] you for all things we know that Lord all
[17:54] that we have need of is within our grasp
[17:57] and our understanding all we got to do
[17:59] is believe it so we ask you Lord to help
[18:02] us to believe and then Lord helped our
[18:04] unbelief
[18:05] to bring it out of the way and get rid
[18:07] of it to where we can walk in you and
[18:09] the Lord forgive our sins and guide us
[18:11] by your grace and love and just as we
[18:14] open the word here to read we know that
[18:16] nobody has a right to read it until they
[18:18] ask permission so we ask your permission
[18:20] Lord to speak from your word and that
[18:23] you wouldn't come and make it manifest
[18:24] let it not be as the scripture will read
[18:27] and that it not be me or anyone like
[18:29] that speaking but let it be you speaking
[18:32] through each one of us that was we talk
[18:35] about you we love you and we thank you
[18:37] in Jesus name Amen
[18:40] Jonah 2 verse 9 but I will sacrifice
[18:48] unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving
[18:50] I will pay that that I have vowed
[18:54] salvation is of the Lord they were
[18:59] giving to John 14
[19:02] we'll start with verse 9 now really what
[19:07] I'm using this for here is two we're
[19:10] going to try to bring over into
[19:12] salvation coming more into the birth and
[19:16] we know that Jesus Christ had to come
[19:18] and die to release that life and that's
[19:20] why we're using this scripture then
[19:22] we'll pick up mark in a minute as we're
[19:24] going through all right but jesus saith
[19:27] unto Him have I been so long with you
[19:29] and yet hast thou not known me Philip he
[19:35] that hath seen me has seen the father
[19:38] and how say us thou then show us the
[19:41] father that word if you understand well
[19:45] he said believe us I just believed like
[19:48] the devil or something believe us thou
[19:51] not that I am in the father and the
[19:54] father in me the words that I speak unto
[19:57] you I speak not of myself but the father
[20:00] that dwelleth in me he doeth the works
[20:02] in other words he do it's worse but he's
[20:04] also doing the talking you'll see that's
[20:06] what we're getting to believe me that I
[20:09] am in the father and the father in me or
[20:11] else believe me for the very works sake
[20:14] burley verily I say unto you he that
[20:17] believeth on me
[20:18] the works that I do shall he do also and
[20:20] greater works than these shall he do
[20:23] because I go unto my father you may be
[20:26] seated the Lord at his blessing to the
[20:30] reading of the word now to background a
[20:34] little bit and then continue on it our
[20:38] thought we've been talking for quite a
[20:41] while on a topic we've talked about and
[20:46] called it salvation and now we're
[20:49] talking about going from salvation to
[20:54] Redemption all right the Old Testament
[20:57] people had salvation you know all right
[21:02] they had God living with them they had a
[21:06] thing that but it wasn't called
[21:09] Redemption back daraa because it did not
[21:12] bring God into full view because it was
[21:15] the Old Testament form so then it was
[21:17] really basically speaking of salvation
[21:20] which means deliverance and it come all
[21:22] the way through and then when you see
[21:24] that it will walk into the new testament
[21:26] form of saying then to bring it to
[21:31] redemptive plan of god you'll see that
[21:34] the salvation has been complete
[21:36] alright now we started with our thoughts
[21:40] in genesis of you know bringing forth
[21:46] the plan that God had and we'll repeat
[21:50] these later more with God in the garden
[21:53] in Adam he placed in the are brought
[21:57] into being what his plan for mankind was
[22:00] and that was to be you know to bring
[22:03] forth man and let him live upon the
[22:06] earth it was never meant for us to live
[22:09] up in heaven heaven to me is not what
[22:13] we're gonna go out and float in the
[22:14] clouds and it means I thought we believe
[22:17] that the future home was going to come
[22:19] right here you know and and then that
[22:22] way we will have our heavenly places you
[22:25] know in heaven we'll be here
[22:27] alright see then we brought that down so
[22:29] remain
[22:30] that it now as we jump over to minute
[22:32] and when I say it you remember the point
[22:34] we started out with Redemption you know
[22:38] but it wasn't called Redemption it was
[22:41] called salvation because Christ had not
[22:44] come and died to make the redemptive
[22:47] plan alright so it was through the blood
[22:49] of bulls and goats but it brought him to
[22:51] salvation it provided them a place when
[22:54] they died they had a place to go to
[22:56] called the Blues in the Vapor ahem you
[22:57] know are called
[22:59] paradise and and all in it it supplied a
[23:02] place it was really a form of salvation
[23:05] for mankind but it was covered by the
[23:08] blood of bulls and goats and then Jesus
[23:10] Christ would come and pay the price for
[23:12] bringing it into being you know of where
[23:15] we need to be all right remember I said
[23:18] he started in Adam what he wanted all
[23:21] right you see Adams standing there as
[23:23] what God wanted for mankind all right
[23:28] now we're going to jump up a little bit
[23:30] because we came over and we picked up
[23:33] Christ and bringing him in to make a way
[23:36] to bring it to where it could turn from
[23:38] salvation into a redemptive plan and
[23:40] then this morning we were bringing down
[23:44] to a basis and showing you that we're
[23:48] here now and we can understand what
[23:51] happened on the day of Pentecost all
[23:54] right and see doing that then we're
[23:56] going back to her that you see in a
[24:00] minute that brother Branham said they
[24:05] asked him said or didn't ask him he
[24:07] asked his own civil question he said
[24:09] what is the new earth Christ the mystery
[24:11] of God revealed we'll read it in a
[24:12] minute he said it's a revelation of
[24:14] Jesus Christ personally to you well then
[24:18] that new birth is a revelation okay now
[24:22] watch the point go we ended up right at
[24:24] the end this morning on what it was
[24:27] revealed unto Abel right it was revealed
[24:32] unto Abel that it was through the blood
[24:37] he Cain had a good thoughts and ideas
[24:40] but it didn't work out it just typed
[24:42] like works and
[24:43] things that we try to do to save
[24:45] ourselves you know be able by revelation
[24:48] offered unto God a more excellent
[24:50] sacrifice than Cain did and God respect
[24:54] to that and took it so there's your
[24:56] salvation now all right so there's your
[24:59] believing point that we talked about and
[25:02] then we'll bring that on up into me and
[25:04] you you know because we're bringing it
[25:06] up as a revelation all right see then
[25:10] you can see that we have a long journey
[25:13] to go and in time I don't believe we'll
[25:16] run out before we we get out of here but
[25:19] you know that's all right if it does and
[25:22] we'll just finish over there the so
[25:24] salvation started in the basis of when
[25:28] it come over from mankind it started in
[25:31] the basis - with Cain and Abel you know
[25:35] the first two and God accepting Abel's
[25:38] sacrifice because it was a revelation to
[25:42] them right now it's all going to be
[25:44] built on Revelation all right
[25:46] everything's built on Revelation okay
[25:49] now we're going to get to the scriptures
[25:50] in a minute where no man can call Jesus
[25:52] the Christ or say that Jesus is the
[25:54] Christ without the Holy Ghost all right
[25:58] now we'll pick that up in a minute in a
[26:00] in our thought but we want to try to lay
[26:02] it out to where we can see that what
[26:06] have we been talking about now make sure
[26:09] you follow the point we gave you the
[26:12] quotes this morning and the things and
[26:15] we have them laying here if you not like
[26:17] them and but brother Branham says if
[26:20] you're a new birth begins when you
[26:25] believe your new birth we've given over
[26:30] and over begins when you believe now he
[26:33] didn't say that it was in full
[26:34] manifestation are giving you eternal
[26:37] life he said it begins so your new birth
[26:41] begins when you repentance is genuine
[26:44] and you ask the Lord to forgive you God
[26:48] already is working in you to bring about
[26:52] those things that he wants to bring
[26:55] about so he brings you to justification
[26:58] chopping off your pie sins right then he
[27:01] brings you to sanctification which is
[27:04] cleansing and setting aside and then you
[27:07] get the baptism of the Holy Ghost which
[27:10] is the completed point of the new birth
[27:13] for you at that stage now there's more
[27:16] stages to go along later but we're not
[27:18] concerned with that we're concerned with
[27:20] staying with the new birth all right
[27:22] so now then what was we talking about
[27:25] what would we talk about this past
[27:27] Wednesday so you believe on to eternal
[27:32] life I didn't say you got to eternal
[27:34] life when you believe that's incorrect
[27:36] that's what the Baptist believed in etc
[27:39] and the Saints but you believe unto
[27:43] eternal life so if you take that
[27:46] believing and it doesn't stop now
[27:50] remember we covered how if you're
[27:52] believing stops you lose your salvation
[27:54] now that's batgirl when you're just
[27:57] under justification and sanctification
[28:00] it's not under the new bird you can't
[28:03] have eternal life and lose it God not an
[28:06] Indian giver to give it to you and then
[28:07] you do something wrong he takes it away
[28:08] from you no but when you're in
[28:11] justification and sanctification
[28:13] remember you're not born again yet fully
[28:16] you're just in the process of being
[28:19] mourned again all right see then that
[28:22] brings it down to showing you that
[28:25] mankind has so missed out as the Prophet
[28:28] said the baptism with the Holy Ghost
[28:31] until you know he said it's just been so
[28:33] incorrectly talked so if people say the
[28:36] baptism and they'll say this and they'll
[28:38] say that all right they'll say well the
[28:41] new birth is when you cried you shouted
[28:43] you that's not the new birth a baby
[28:46] don't cry in the wound to the mother
[28:49] it's when it comes out you spank it and
[28:53] it cries all right so then your after
[28:57] effects is you're speaking in tongues
[28:59] you're crying your the things that went
[29:01] with it and any baby that comes forth
[29:04] it's going to come forth crying it's
[29:06] going to have emotions so you're going
[29:09] to have emotions
[29:11] that will bring you something that when
[29:13] you did get born again something will
[29:15] happen back through the human element to
[29:17] her that you'll have the correct
[29:20] understanding all right but remember now
[29:23] we know the story that I are in the book
[29:25] of Acts when the Holy Ghost fell and it
[29:28] said how here we ever man in her own
[29:29] tongue wherein word
[29:30] it wasn't the speaking in the tongue
[29:34] it was the hearing right that's what the
[29:39] Bible says then there were people from
[29:43] all over the world basically at dark
[29:44] that time because of it being a set
[29:46] aside time for them together all right
[29:49] we'll see then it was not you know the
[29:52] basis said how here we ever man you know
[29:55] we Baptists we had it figured out that
[29:57] they would like 12 of them you know 11
[29:59] November 12 and and they all knew he's
[30:02] got a new languages so one was speaking
[30:04] uttered interpret you don't never hear
[30:06] nothing like that been trying to explain
[30:08] the day of Pentecost you know but that's
[30:10] not what it said they said how here we
[30:12] have a man in our own tongue wherein we
[30:14] were born all right the the mystery has
[30:17] always been the hearing if you want to
[30:20] do any evidence of the Holy Ghost place
[30:22] it into the hearing oh I got a little
[30:28] bit for cholera liver what we thought
[30:31] he's into speaking and the doing and
[30:33] then we got to do this but one said they
[30:36] asked them to iring on the scripture
[30:38] what must we do to be saved
[30:39] and said we tell them what not to do
[30:42] they didn't ask that
[30:44] see that's what to do to be safe so we
[30:46] believe ever believing and be baptized
[30:48] and you know in all it all right but see
[30:52] getting to the point of where that we
[30:53] see that your salvation does begin with
[30:59] you believing but now that's not
[31:03] make-believe or just haphazardly believe
[31:05] it you know
[31:07] no Cain believed in God Cain worship God
[31:14] Cain offered the offerings and things to
[31:17] God what was the difference was able to
[31:23] what kind of a guy or a blessed guy or
[31:24] something or was it that that Abel got a
[31:28] revelation
[31:30] well now what was the difference direct
[31:32] the revelation all right as I said in
[31:35] this morning you have in the world today
[31:37] somewhere probably into a 1 billion
[31:39] class of so-called Christian believers
[31:44] where you count all of your churches and
[31:46] everything you know and the Buddha's and
[31:48] the Hindus and the different thing and
[31:50] come out with religious believers you'd
[31:52] have a big inner so are you gonna say
[31:54] those people are lost no I'm not gonna
[31:58] say they're lost I'm gonna say that's
[32:01] between them and God so we're not
[32:05] worried about them I'm not about to
[32:07] appreciate them I'm preaching right here
[32:09] it's to you and I to get us to see
[32:12] salvation and get us to come to the
[32:14] place that God wants us to be all right
[32:18] and see then we could see that if that's
[32:22] believing as I've emphasized over and
[32:25] over you start believing don't stop
[32:28] don't let nothing hinder that well I
[32:32] went so far you know no I did and I I've
[32:35] done pretty good as I told you we used
[32:37] to having a Baptist Church
[32:38] we had a feller that they'd go get him
[32:40] ever revival that we had
[32:42] I'm not joking you year after year
[32:44] they'd bring him get him come to church
[32:45] and he'd come to church and he'd come to
[32:47] the altar and he cried and pray and he'd
[32:49] get up and he'd say I got it I got it
[32:51] well you know what next year you ain't
[32:53] got him he come up he was hurt I got it
[32:55] I got it
[32:56] well it went on for about four or five
[32:59] years and I can remember and the life
[33:01] that I was his way back at fifty years
[33:03] ago but the life that I've heard about
[33:05] it he stayed well maybe he got enough to
[33:09] keep on believing until something
[33:10] happened to it but my point is you got
[33:14] to start with believing no I just miss
[33:17] the Holy Ghost just fell away there's no
[33:18] such thing
[33:19] show me in the Bible anywhere I've read
[33:23] around this message anywhere that you
[33:25] get to Holy Ghost without first hearing
[33:28] the word I mean without first hearing
[33:32] the word you heard it from somebody so
[33:36] or some something it may have been
[33:41] grandma'll you might have heard her
[33:42] praying you might have hear heard
[33:44] somebody say a word but the words got to
[33:46] be planted first before you can do
[33:48] anything all right
[33:50] are you with me on that point all right
[33:52] see then watch now so then our salvation
[33:57] jump up now to where we are our
[33:59] salvation then is based on if i
[34:02] believing will hold out
[34:05] well you're funny preacher cuz i just
[34:09] everything got no no i'm a firm believer
[34:12] so is your prophet in what three stages
[34:17] of grace justification sanctification
[34:22] and the baptism of the holy ghost that's
[34:27] the new birth without that you don't
[34:30] have the new birth all right is that
[34:33] straight enough to put it and that's
[34:36] worth it Luther talks justification when
[34:39] we talk sanctification the Pentecostals
[34:42] taught the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[34:45] they received that Holy Ghost with signs
[34:49] and wonders following them sure they
[34:52] cabbage down on the gifts and the things
[34:54] but still they got to the birth when the
[34:58] Prophet came he didn't have to start
[35:01] some new thing right he just preached
[35:07] what they had brought before him was
[35:10] that the way the prophets were posed to
[35:12] be they're supposed to look back what's
[35:13] behind him and the previous and what it
[35:16] spoke up
[35:16] I mean all we Old Testament are new or
[35:18] whatever and then lay their foundation
[35:21] upon what was behind her before them so
[35:25] brother Branham he knew that this the
[35:27] plan of salvation was justification same
[35:29] case in the baptismal oligos now you can
[35:34] go through that at one time in the altar
[35:37] praying before God but I'll quote the
[35:40] Prophet back to you he said very few
[35:42] will do that so most of them are going
[35:45] to be kind of like me
[35:49] good old Baptist Deacon hood serving God
[35:51] preaching I mean teaching adults and
[35:54] everything else and then come in this
[35:55] message and I found out I was a baby
[35:59] that needed salvation
[36:02] well you come into message didn't you
[36:05] yeah but I still had that mass in me and
[36:10] so did you okay no I got rid of
[36:15] everything you just lied so you need to
[36:18] repent of that one but listen see then
[36:24] you've got to believe in justification
[36:25] st. casein of apt ISM holders to come
[36:27] out to the new world because they know
[36:30] shortcuts all right
[36:32] and in doing that it starts when you
[36:34] believe and that's what I've tried to
[36:38] teach you all the way through the old
[36:39] test everything was on the basis of what
[36:41] they could blade and it's on the basis
[36:44] for you once you can believe but if
[36:46] you're believing stops or you let
[36:48] something enter enter there and caused
[36:50] you problems and you're believing then
[36:54] is it your father God's fault that you
[36:56] fall away now you know yourself don't
[37:01] kid with me and I won't we you we just
[37:03] talk plain that's the way I am blunt out
[37:07] of all the millions of so-called
[37:08] Christians you know they're not
[37:09] Christians right you know the basis
[37:13] everyone we're not born again Christian
[37:15] no that's no problem that's just truth
[37:19] because they have a form of godliness
[37:22] but that's all they have they just have
[37:24] a believing form of that they don't
[37:26] continue oh you say well how can you say
[37:29] that Hank say it because all you got to
[37:30] go do is go present the word to them and
[37:32] when you present the word to them and
[37:34] they don't accept it then you'll find
[37:36] out if they've got a problem in what
[37:37] they're believing but we shouldn't have
[37:40] the problem in our believing well
[37:43] brother Dan we're born-again Christians
[37:44] we've been in the message in a long time
[37:45] why are you preaching to us that you
[37:48] need to be born again because you need
[37:49] to be born again
[37:52] right cuz if you ain't born again you
[37:55] need to be born again know that solve
[37:58] the problem see this left into your
[38:01] hands whether or not your boy
[38:02] again and everybody as I said this
[38:05] morning has some reason or thought or
[38:07] something
[38:08] basing it of why they believe they're
[38:11] saved well see then that everything that
[38:16] my statements are make everything that
[38:20] you could think of to try to prove that
[38:22] you're saved Satan can impersonate every
[38:26] one of them and is that true I mean you
[38:33] see how did you cried you spoken oh you
[38:35] don't know Satan can impersonate
[38:36] everyone there's only one thing that
[38:39] Satan cannot impersonate nice I said
[38:41] this morning I know what the Prophet
[38:43] said about he said he can't be the holy
[38:45] ghost that started he can't be God we
[38:47] got that straight now but now what is it
[38:49] that he came that he can't do that God
[38:52] can do and you and I can do what is the
[38:58] thing that he and he can't do but you
[39:00] and I can do that God can do believe the
[39:04] word right to believe the word there's
[39:09] your evidence of the Holy Ghost whether
[39:11] or not the spirit in you agrees with the
[39:13] word now watch what it says LaRon didn't
[39:16] say the Holy Ghost in you agreeing with
[39:17] the word or agreed
[39:19] it's agrees it means continue home right
[39:24] if your experience ever stops you got a
[39:27] problem now anything you let get in your
[39:30] way to colleges to stop he's
[39:33] automatically bigger than you are that's
[39:35] one thing I had to settle in the Baptist
[39:37] Church because I had too many problems
[39:40] in front of me because I was 18 years
[39:43] old and and I knew the church in the
[39:46] situation's and and I knew the Deacons
[39:48] that the claim was running around and
[39:51] and everything else I knew the whole ins
[39:53] and out of the church well I had to get
[39:56] that thing out from in front of me
[39:58] before I could even consider about God
[40:03] see so I had to dump that get it away so
[40:06] let's dump all of our thoughts get it
[40:08] out and no matter what anybody's done
[40:10] the message what they're gonna do or
[40:11] anything like it ain't got nothing to do
[40:13] about your salvation in mind
[40:17] now then we can put it on believe in
[40:20] God's Word
[40:21] well I Adam as we said was God's example
[40:27] all right then when it come forth and
[40:31] men came into a lost condition now you
[40:35] got Abel and Cain right and you got it
[40:43] based upon what you need if Adam and Eve
[40:48] had a stayed with God's Word
[40:50] now am i right they had to word to be
[40:54] behind all right when he got out of them
[40:57] behind that word she failed
[40:59] you know what Adam had to get out from
[41:02] behind - we can puff him up all we want
[41:04] - he still went out right all right but
[41:08] see then you start with mankind and you
[41:12] start with Abel by revelation seeing the
[41:19] salvation of that day would be based
[41:24] upon his believing that he was born in
[41:28] his mother's blood from his daddy's
[41:31] blood and he could see what had happened
[41:33] in the garden
[41:35] all right then he knew there was only
[41:37] one way to approach back to that Garden
[41:41] of Eden to talk about salvation was what
[41:46] drew the blood of bulls and goats so he
[41:51] knew it was the blood that brought him
[41:52] out and he knew there was no way to
[41:54] bring him back when God revealed to Abel
[41:57] that it was blood all right that put the
[42:01] whole basis of salvation based upon
[42:04] blood so that put the whole Old
[42:06] Testament based upon the blood right
[42:10] believing that that blood atonement was
[42:12] for them okay all right then when you
[42:16] come to the New Testament you come to
[42:20] Jesus Christ it was not the blood of an
[42:22] animal it was the blood of Almighty God
[42:25] that would come to shed - life
[42:29] the soul that was in that could come
[42:31] back on the believer cause the animal
[42:32] didn't now no soul huh
[42:35] God having a soul he could release that
[42:37] soul and that soul could come back in
[42:40] the form of the baptism of the Holy
[42:42] Ghost
[42:42] all right now when that came into that
[42:46] being then he now you've come to kind of
[42:50] where we stopped that go to review this
[42:54] quick second then your disciples three
[42:58] and a half years it took them to walk
[43:01] through justification and sanctification
[43:05] am i right
[43:07] three and a half years that they walk
[43:09] with the Lord Jesus
[43:10] they were good believers but they were
[43:13] believers unto they did not have eternal
[43:17] life why because the Bible said that
[43:21] Jesus had not been glorified so the Holy
[43:25] Ghost had not been given you can say
[43:28] what I think is this I don't care that's
[43:30] nothing to me you think what you want to
[43:32] understand with the Bible because the
[43:34] Bible says that you know what you can't
[43:36] do it all right now we're gonna get into
[43:39] some now stating it or that no man can
[43:44] call Jesus or say that Jesus is a Christ
[43:47] without the Holy Ghost now let's hold on
[43:49] to that thought in point for a minute
[43:52] all right see then we'll we'll see that
[43:55] it's still based on faith because what
[43:59] was our final points this morning we'll
[44:02] pick up right there where was that what
[44:04] was the final points from this morning
[44:07] now that we were talking about okay I
[44:11] showed you where I'm a firm believer in
[44:14] the basis that justification
[44:20] sanctification the baptism the Holy
[44:21] Ghost makes the new birth no I've always
[44:28] believed this that's I've heard the
[44:30] message the new birth the born-again
[44:35] experience and the baptism of the Holy
[44:37] Ghost is one of the sign now don't say
[44:41] well one of them is a
[44:42] starting here and then this and comes in
[44:45] and goat here and this one goes dire in
[44:47] front if you want that you go with it
[44:49] I'm just I'm not too interested in that
[44:52] I'm interested in one time because
[44:55] they're the same thing and I gave you
[44:58] two quotes where brother branham
[44:59] mentions the new birth the born-again
[45:01] experience the baptism when the whole
[45:02] goes in one paragraph right and gave it
[45:08] to you out of a message of hearing
[45:09] recognizing and acting on the Word of
[45:12] God did he brings the baptism of the
[45:15] Holy Ghost the new birth and all and he
[45:18] brings them all into one statement that
[45:21] they were filled with the Holy Ghost the
[45:23] Holy Spirit is the new birth alright now
[45:27] we went from there to show you he kept
[45:29] the same line as he comes on the end of
[45:31] the message further over and we got on
[45:33] to the message God's provided way for
[45:36] this day 1964 where he's talking about
[45:41] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost then
[45:44] and the new birth no.not and like
[45:47] something jointed know it being the new
[45:49] birth and being born again with the Holy
[45:52] Ghost God brings us into the new birth
[45:58] alright see like I said this morning and
[46:01] I know I've got the human mind I have
[46:02] one it don't work too good but it still
[46:06] does but it's not too hard to talk about
[46:10] the new birth being you know in
[46:15] believing it and things and especially
[46:17] when you talk about it being you got a
[46:21] new birth you can kind of look at that
[46:23] and comprehend it alright but then when
[46:26] you start to talking about the
[46:28] born-again experience you can kind of
[46:29] handle that but the hardest thing for
[46:33] the human mind is to comprehend
[46:35] I said comprehend because we're gonna
[46:38] get into it it's got to be revealed to
[46:39] you we're gonna get into that it's got
[46:43] to be revealed to you but to try to
[46:45] comprehend that the baptism of the Holy
[46:48] Ghost is not signs and wonders
[46:55] we spent the whole time this morning I'm
[46:57] talking about the baby gets here the
[47:00] baby cries right the shouting of
[47:06] speaking in tongues the things you call
[47:08] your experience that's not your
[47:13] experience your experience is the birth
[47:17] and brother branham said I'll give it to
[47:20] you what he said the mystery of this
[47:23] endtime age was one time was receiving
[47:28] the baptism of the Holy Spirit without a
[47:30] sensation you remember that incident I
[47:39] gave about the man that found the track
[47:42] you know where were you spend eternity
[47:44] he goes through all of his life spins
[47:46] all of his money sells everything he's
[47:48] got trying to pay the preachers get him
[47:50] to help him and none of them couldn't
[47:51] have him he finally comes to brother
[47:52] Branham he had been through the
[47:54] Lutheran's he had been through the
[47:56] Methodists he had been through the
[47:58] Pentecostals and done everything they
[48:00] told him to do but he wasn't satisfied
[48:03] and he come to brother Branham and
[48:04] brother Branham said you don't need he
[48:08] said you pray for me brother Branham he
[48:10] said you don't need me to pray for you
[48:11] he said the word has already set you
[48:14] free he said you mean I had it all the
[48:17] time he said yes now what he had when he
[48:24] started you can argue what you walk till
[48:26] I ain't gonna argue it I know one thing
[48:28] about it he started believing because he
[48:33] showed his believing because he went on
[48:35] to the next step the next step the next
[48:37] step
[48:38] spend every dime of money he had he said
[48:39] that he had a half a million dollars in
[48:41] the car business it wound up with a
[48:44] clunker car a truck or something but
[48:49] there he was the whole time seeking for
[48:51] God and had had him maybe it took all of
[48:54] that time to bring the man to the
[48:56] position of believing that God is real I
[48:58] don't know that's human God I just know
[49:02] that happened but now listen also I've
[49:07] never taught it and I never found
[49:08] runaround
[49:08] you show me brother round them ever
[49:10] saying you could receive the new birth
[49:11] without an experienced Sumi he said
[49:14] anything about the baptism of the whole
[49:16] to go without an experience show me
[49:18] anything about a born-again experience
[49:19] without an experience there's a vast
[49:22] difference in the word experience and
[49:24] sensation sensation is a stimulation
[49:28] upon your fleshly items talking doing
[49:33] you know anything shouting crying an
[49:36] experience is something you lived
[49:39] through go look it up in the dictionary
[49:43] it's something you go through and do you
[49:47] remember going through the experience
[49:50] that's all I've asked you remember your
[49:54] experience you've heard mine over and
[49:57] over I didn't take it in his 11 years
[50:00] old that I saw God in the Baptist Church
[50:02] then in that I didn't take that as a new
[50:04] birth I didn't take it as a new birth
[50:07] when they gave me the job as a deacon in
[50:09] a Baptist Church at 23 years of age I
[50:14] didn't take it at all of the things that
[50:16] I saw God in those days because when I
[50:20] heard runaround I'm talking about a
[50:21] baptism of the holy go I knew I didn't
[50:23] have what he's talking about yet I had
[50:26] done all the things but I didn't have
[50:31] what he's talking about heart and God
[50:35] had to come and settle that with me as a
[50:37] revelation from God's Word and then when
[50:41] he brought it to that basis and brother
[50:42] said brother mote told me said you got
[50:44] to believe that God is his word in him
[50:46] and his word as one he said you accept
[50:48] that word and when I did that was all I
[50:50] needed right we ended up talking about
[50:54] experience a little bit this morning of
[50:56] where God speaks to you speaks to you by
[51:01] revelation
[51:02] well God ain't never spoke to me see
[51:05] that's what you what I didn't hear it
[51:08] repeat that again no that's not the kind
[51:13] of hearing from God that I'm talking
[51:15] about I'm talking about the Prophet that
[51:19] said which one was it Elisha which one
[51:22] were
[51:22] he went into the cave one of the
[51:24] prophets you know and all he did have
[51:26] the rain and had to shower had to
[51:28] Thunder it had to lightning that
[51:29] everything and he didn't get up and walk
[51:31] out
[51:32] but finally little steel small voice
[51:34] words of still small voice Oh sitting
[51:37] over in the corner
[51:38] hey prophet get it no it was inside him
[51:41] he was inside of him in his being his
[51:46] sold his person of who he is
[51:49] you said you make it could be in his
[51:51] shoulder today yeah why not well
[51:54] wouldn't you think it would be in his
[51:55] soul at that time I'm talking about a
[51:57] thought I'm not talking about something
[51:59] that made him a born-again believer in
[52:02] the body of Christ I'm talking about a
[52:03] thought I'm talking about something that
[52:07] and you've got to get that settle that
[52:08] doubt to come into your mind that comes
[52:11] into your being that you're not afraid
[52:13] of nobody have you ever been that or
[52:17] you're not afraid
[52:18] I quote was run around him but I'd do it
[52:21] if God told me to go tell him what
[52:24] George Washington's gonna raise the dead
[52:26] I'd go to Washington or everywhere he's
[52:27] at my because I believe it he spoke to
[52:31] me and many times and told me things
[52:34] we've had those experiences its own
[52:36] record where I called for rained one
[52:39] time to come it hadn't rained in months
[52:40] and all that once I see you better get
[52:42] out to roll your windows up
[52:43] it rained like everything there's a way
[52:46] this month October I mean the August
[52:48] that was on record and Gainesville was
[52:51] also said to him Carlton to stop the
[52:53] rain I've had God to speak to him and I
[52:56] come tell you well that's not putting it
[53:02] to try to make me something footing that
[53:03] to make God something what are we going
[53:05] to start believing what he says but you
[53:11] see that's our problem he speaks to us
[53:14] and then we begin to doubt or listen
[53:18] we'll do this way we'll go to somebody
[53:20] and say you know the Lord spoke to me
[53:22] and they say we don't believe in in God
[53:25] speaking to nobody anymore but to
[53:27] brother Branham did God spoke to brother
[53:32] Brent we're talking about getting it we
[53:35] ain't talking
[53:36] about getting the Word of God the Word
[53:38] of God come to the Prophet not everyday
[53:42] life to the Prophet could if he wanted
[53:45] to but the Word of God the revelation of
[53:47] the Word of God comes to the Prophet but
[53:49] why can't it be that way
[53:50] why can't gifts operate to where he
[53:52] could say speak through one person and
[53:55] say get out of Loula cause the mark two
[53:57] o'clock is gonna blow away and it
[53:59] happened why can't we believe that while
[54:06] we can't we accept God speaking to us
[54:08] because we're going to get just a little
[54:10] further we're going to get into the
[54:11] basis of whether or not you can believe
[54:13] that not only that God speaks to you but
[54:16] how that he takes you and it speaks
[54:17] through you oh we got a long ways to go
[54:23] ahead all right but listen what is the
[54:28] new birth what is the born-again
[54:31] experience what is the baptism of the
[54:34] Holy Ghost and I said it's easy to talk
[54:36] about the new birth they're born again
[54:38] but when you say baptism you're thinking
[54:40] about something that comes down out of
[54:41] heaven
[54:44] well read the book of Acts he said the
[54:49] room was filled but nobody get they
[54:53] didn't get the Holy Ghost from the room
[54:54] feel the wind follow in right
[54:59] read your Bible what happened tongues of
[55:02] fire set on each one of them your
[55:05] prophet said that was God dividing
[55:06] himself what was the new birth on the
[55:09] day of Pentecost not the rushing mighty
[55:12] wind some of you know the story of
[55:19] brother Adam was standing really lavell
[55:21] was listening to him the other day on a
[55:23] testimony he said he was there and
[55:25] brother on his clothes was moving and
[55:28] things and the wind went through the
[55:29] belly but you know what it never
[55:31] mentioned boy nobody that are getting
[55:32] born here butter on him never mentioned
[55:35] nobody they're getting morning you you
[55:39] understand you understand what I'm
[55:43] getting at the new birth we will
[55:49] eventually
[55:50] - it is the birth of the word now you
[55:53] tell me anything that is not it's the
[55:57] birth of the word see it's not when you
[55:59] believe this message it's when this
[56:01] message is revealed to you that there's
[56:04] no doubts in your heart what is there so
[56:07] I don't care what they talk about i 200
[56:08] in Arizona about the he was out there on
[56:11] the wrong date and this date and that
[56:13] date I don't care I didn't care years
[56:16] ago but the thing of it was don't were
[56:18] here was here then when those things
[56:21] they came out in nineteen about seventy
[56:23] that that discrepancy was out there it's
[56:26] not this new point they came out with a
[56:28] discrepancy about the dates I told him
[56:31] in I don't care
[56:32] ain't got nothing do with dates well
[56:36] brother Brennan said if you catch me
[56:38] wrong in one place I'm wrong in all of
[56:40] it well now what are you gonna do answer
[56:48] me what are you gonna do did Brett
[56:50] around make that statement he said if
[56:53] I'm wrong in one place I'm wrong in all
[56:54] of it did he make the statement at least
[56:57] somebody should do or whatever brother
[57:00] Donnie Reagan says that means a man I'm
[57:05] just asking for a truth in you what you
[57:10] see that's were you're thinking then
[57:14] runs you the wrong way because you say
[57:20] brother branham was wrong show me where
[57:23] he was wrong now I know he made human
[57:27] error mistake seven hundred seven
[57:29] thousand that's human error don't talk
[57:31] to me about little Petey Patti doctor
[57:33] and I did come bring me something show
[57:39] me where he changed his doctrine from
[57:43] the beginning to the end
[57:45] tell me anywhere changed it I know where
[57:50] you going I know what your mind hooked
[57:52] on especially out there there's a lot of
[57:53] you here know one where I'm going when
[57:57] brother branham talked at the white
[57:59] horse rider was the Holy Ghost you just
[58:02] remember one time
[58:04] no profit no one knew that mystery until
[58:09] that day it was revealed to him are you
[58:15] with me
[58:16] well then was he wrong when he said to
[58:19] hot horse rider was a holy go words yes
[58:24] but nobody could correct him
[58:26] Clarence Larkin talked to white horse
[58:28] rider was the antichrist way before
[58:30] brother Branham ever come alone with
[58:32] Clarence Larkin with no profit
[58:34] ain't no no message I'm putting you here
[58:39] come show me where brother Branham was
[58:41] wrong now he made human errors and
[58:45] speeches thoughts and things yes but you
[58:50] come to show me you better come prepared
[58:51] like that he said well he talked to
[58:53] heart horse rider long well you didn't
[58:55] know about the white horse rider and
[58:56] nobody out didn't know about it until
[58:58] God revealed it to the Prophet so nobody
[59:01] was responsible for that you can't say
[59:06] he was wrong you see that's what I'm not
[59:12] liked because that's where I stand
[59:16] well now bread run said silly little
[59:21] human statements and letting that rest
[59:31] tell me where he changed his doctrine
[59:35] now listen I'll show you where he
[59:38] progressed in his doctrine right I'll
[59:43] show you where he covered adoption in 50
[59:47] he come up in the sick of 55 to hit here
[59:51] you him then he comes on up then he hits
[59:53] the statue of a perfect man but that's
[59:55] growth development that's not changing
[1:00:01] this doctor I want to show me where
[1:00:02] change this doctor I didn't mean to get
[1:00:05] into that with this that's just plain
[1:00:07] enough because listen we got to the
[1:00:11] point this morning or saying what what
[1:00:13] is the new birth
[1:00:17] hey what is the new birth and I've
[1:00:25] already made mistake much their way I
[1:00:26] believe it no mountain earthing but I
[1:00:29] still the way I believe it I don't
[1:00:31] matter me I put it out why don't you put
[1:00:33] it out that's where the problem I don't
[1:00:36] that's where they would go see they'll
[1:00:38] get out in there go around over here and
[1:00:45] they'll say I kind of believe it's this
[1:00:47] way well why don't you go tell brother
[1:00:49] no he wouldn't understand me and he
[1:00:52] would you done put it out you doesn't
[1:00:57] got your mouth ruined and got it among
[1:01:00] the congregation that you don't agree
[1:01:01] when I come sit down let's see what it
[1:01:03] is
[1:01:04] come on I admit one time I I did we was
[1:01:09] preaching with my mom Daniel said anyway
[1:01:11] and I did wait a whole bunch of
[1:01:13] preachers but 20 of them I guess I said
[1:01:15] I wish to goodness that she would come
[1:01:17] and tell me that I'm wrong now you'll go
[1:01:20] home and tell everybody else I said I'd
[1:01:23] like to have a raise of hands how many
[1:01:26] of you in here would say I'm wrong on
[1:01:29] the Daniel 70 weeks one man raised his
[1:01:33] hand I said brother I appreciate that
[1:01:38] I don't I appreciate it
[1:01:42] at least he said he didn't agree you
[1:01:45] know what the rest I'm done you know run
[1:01:50] all over the country all right but
[1:01:53] listen let's get into it
[1:01:55] we've come up to the stage of the new
[1:01:57] birth or come up to the place that we
[1:02:00] talk about Jesus Christ being a
[1:02:02] deliverer
[1:02:03] being the one that paid the price and
[1:02:05] all like that and he had to give his
[1:02:06] life to release the life to be able to
[1:02:08] come back into us to give us the new
[1:02:10] work that's why the apostles were three
[1:02:12] and a half years in the stating of it
[1:02:15] but never received the Holy Ghost until
[1:02:17] after Jesus Christ was crucified and the
[1:02:20] Holy Ghost came back onto that Pentecost
[1:02:22] and that Holy Ghost was their new birth
[1:02:25] which was their born-again experience
[1:02:28] which was the back
[1:02:30] tear them of the Holy Ghost on the day
[1:02:35] of Pentecost right okay they don't pull
[1:02:44] over too far just hang with me let's
[1:02:47] think about something all right
[1:02:52] let's make sure brother branham answers
[1:02:54] it to her then we don't have any trouble
[1:02:56] go to number 11 now we're gonna have to
[1:02:58] jump 7-eleven back interval go to number
[1:03:00] 11 which is Christ the mystery of God
[1:03:02] revealed most of you know how I've stood
[1:03:06] on this for 40-something years and I
[1:03:07] still stand on it could I believe it
[1:03:09] look Christ in you makes him the center
[1:03:12] of the rely for the revelation see
[1:03:14] Christ's life in you makes him the
[1:03:16] center of the revelation Christ in the
[1:03:18] Bible makes the Bible the complete
[1:03:19] revelation of Christ Christ in you makes
[1:03:22] you the complete revelation of the whole
[1:03:24] thing see what God is trying to do you
[1:03:29] know it brother Brown said either he
[1:03:31] said the Holy Ghost or what did he says
[1:03:34] not complete without you why because
[1:03:39] it's in you right it's in you it's in
[1:03:43] you it's in you so you're not complete
[1:03:44] he's divided himself out he's completing
[1:03:49] all of us well look what is the new
[1:03:54] birth in you'd say well wrote around now
[1:03:56] this 1963 well brother Branham what is
[1:03:59] the new birth it is the revelation of
[1:04:02] Jesus Christ personally to you amen
[1:04:05] see not you joined a church you shook a
[1:04:07] hand are you done something different
[1:04:09] then the words take out all that I done
[1:04:12] this or do do whatever the Dunn's and
[1:04:14] that's what he's putting in there right
[1:04:16] you shook a hand you done something
[1:04:18] different you said a creek you promised
[1:04:20] to live by a code of rules but Christ
[1:04:23] the Bible he is the word that was
[1:04:25] revealed to you now when you receive
[1:04:32] what you call your experience or the
[1:04:36] baptism of the Holy Ghost was there
[1:04:39] revelation involved if not
[1:04:49] come on you need me to say it if the new
[1:04:54] birth is a revelation and you didn't get
[1:04:59] a new revelation what did you get well
[1:05:07] you you just show me cuz I got this I
[1:05:10] don't yeah I may I quote you now quote
[1:05:12] the Prophet when the guy said to him he
[1:05:14] said I can't believe it because of
[1:05:16] Revelation he said it wasn't made for
[1:05:17] you
[1:05:19] he said when made for unbelievers well I
[1:05:23] don't remember well then maybe you
[1:05:25] didn't see I know that's what I told you
[1:05:28] this is going to empty the church or
[1:05:30] gonna make us one we're doing one of the
[1:05:31] other in the next little while so all
[1:05:33] right well I don't remember when I
[1:05:36] anything happened when I got the new
[1:05:38] birth except I walked up shook the hand
[1:05:40] with a preacher and said I believe it
[1:05:43] all right I hope that's right I'm alone
[1:05:47] but if you didn't get a revelation I
[1:05:51] didn't make it
[1:05:56] well what do you mean wrote okay let's
[1:05:58] keep reading I don't know
[1:06:01] come on up to 35 what is it what is the
[1:06:04] new birth it's Christ being revealed and
[1:06:07] he is the word and when the word is
[1:06:11] revealed it expresses itself see that's
[1:06:14] God's purpose for Christ Jesus was to
[1:06:17] express himself to take it on laws and
[1:06:19] live by his laws and fulfill that by
[1:06:21] dying and the death and thing - what -
[1:06:24] the glorious bride redeemed back that
[1:06:26] will believe only in the we're gonna
[1:06:29] redeem back that will believe on the end
[1:06:32] the Word of God and not slop it like Eve
[1:06:35] did for intellectual conception as a man
[1:06:37] you see that cross the idea that's God's
[1:06:40] idea the new birth reveals you reveals
[1:06:44] this yeah but I've never had this and
[1:06:49] I've never had that I've never heard the
[1:06:51] voice of God and I don't believe in
[1:06:53] nobody hearing voice oh God but but the
[1:06:55] prophet
[1:06:57] well then you're sure cutting off the
[1:07:02] entire Bible okay go ahead to the next
[1:07:06] one
[1:07:10] this is still right in Christ from
[1:07:12] history the new birth is Christ is a
[1:07:14] revelation God has revealed to you this
[1:07:16] great mystery what's the great mystery
[1:07:19] all God woods he put in the cross all
[1:07:20] Christ in the church and took her back
[1:07:22] to the Garden of Eden is that the
[1:07:23] mystery when he's revealed old but
[1:07:26] brother daily I could only come up here
[1:07:28] now it's got to start down here and then
[1:07:31] it grows up desire it starts down here
[1:07:35] right this is a revelation of Jesus
[1:07:38] Christ and grows up here any problem
[1:07:42] with that
[1:07:43] God is revealed to you this great
[1:07:45] mystery and that's a new birth now what
[1:07:49] are you going to do when you get all
[1:07:50] that group together where the revelation
[1:07:53] is perfectly in harmony and God
[1:07:55] expressing it through his word by the
[1:07:57] same actions the same things that he did
[1:08:00] making his word manifest or if the
[1:08:02] church only knew its position it will
[1:08:05] one day then the rapture will go when it
[1:08:08] knows what it is now evidently he caught
[1:08:12] a little unbelief somewhere right and
[1:08:18] evidently he picked up a little unbelief
[1:08:20] comes what's then the rapture will go
[1:08:24] when it knows what it is
[1:08:26] now notice you say brother branham but
[1:08:32] that ain't what's he saying he said when
[1:08:38] the bride all gets the same revelation
[1:08:40] and it's revealed to her then there's
[1:08:43] going to be a rapture he said you say
[1:08:45] that ain't he said oh yes it is - it's
[1:08:51] the truth right
[1:08:53] continue on still from cross the mystery
[1:08:57] now listen to what he says he's talking
[1:09:02] about do you know I'm believing God and
[1:09:04] then any real true believer that means
[1:09:06] you're just that much farther away and
[1:09:09] you backed off in other words
[1:09:10] art is not known by education he is not
[1:09:14] known by how to explain it how is God
[1:09:19] known now listen I'm trying to show you
[1:09:24] a point so listen I asked the question
[1:09:34] when you receive the new birth the God
[1:09:37] speak to your heart a revelation
[1:09:41] I asked that simple question this is the
[1:09:46] answer to the question you think it's
[1:09:49] got to be this got to be that let's see
[1:09:50] what it is
[1:09:52] God is not known about how to explain
[1:09:54] God is known by simplicity and the
[1:09:57] revelation of Jesus Christ to the most
[1:09:59] illiterate person see not your theology
[1:10:05] it's a revelation of Jesus Christ on
[1:10:08] this rock I'll be on my shirt the most
[1:10:11] illiterate person a child that has not
[1:10:19] developed in mind it's called the
[1:10:21] illiterate a 90 years old
[1:10:25] hundred years old if they're illiterate
[1:10:29] they're illiterate right because it
[1:10:33] means with a small amount of mental
[1:10:37] ability to believe and communicate and
[1:10:40] do and times right so you know what God
[1:10:43] can come down to the most illiterate
[1:10:45] little child and speak to their heart in
[1:10:52] that little child as long as it gets in
[1:10:53] this mind that I need to ask Jesus
[1:10:57] Christ to come into my heart and God
[1:11:01] comes into that heart
[1:11:09] what is the revelation to the little
[1:11:10] feller or girl one of them what is the
[1:11:13] revelation you are my child you've
[1:11:18] accepted me as your Savior and I've
[1:11:19] accepted you because remember that is a
[1:11:22] point right you remember you can say I
[1:11:26] accepted Jesus Christ but now can I
[1:11:28] quote the Prophet thank you he said but
[1:11:30] has Christ accepted your confession now
[1:11:35] what if you're confessing to be three
[1:11:36] guards or some kind of outlandish idea
[1:11:40] is he going to accept that all right so
[1:11:47] what is the new birth it's a revelation
[1:11:51] of Jesus Christ personally to you not
[1:11:56] you join the church not you Dunning
[1:11:57] anytime it's a revelation personally to
[1:12:02] you let me see if I can run fast
[1:12:11] go to number seven let's pick up a few
[1:12:13] quotes and and then we'll get to it cuz
[1:12:16] I don't don't want to just put it in 63
[1:12:18] and put it and say the Prophet said this
[1:12:21] and you say what I just one message so
[1:12:22] we're going through the whole message 30
[1:12:26] something whoa okay we go sit on this is
[1:12:29] going to you keep up with where the
[1:12:31] dates are and sin we see when he's
[1:12:35] saying this time we're gonna go through
[1:12:38] from here to here and see what he's
[1:12:41] saying cuz listen so if you just only
[1:12:46] got a mental conception of the Bible if
[1:12:48] you say well I believe it because I read
[1:12:51] it God's got to reveal it to you by your
[1:12:58] heart
[1:12:59] no man can call Jesus the Christ only by
[1:13:06] the Holy Spirit we're gonna read one
[1:13:11] after a while where he says no man can
[1:13:13] call Jesus Christ without the baptism of
[1:13:15] the Holy Spirit
[1:13:20] but I'm gonna say it right here at front
[1:13:23] no man can call Jesus the Christ unless
[1:13:25] the Christ is in you speaking we're
[1:13:29] gonna end that in a hurry okay
[1:13:33] can I quote the Bible they don't have
[1:13:43] these so just hold on Matthew 19 Matthew
[1:13:46] 10 19 and when they deliver you up take
[1:13:51] no thought how or what you shall speak
[1:13:57] where it shall be given you in that same
[1:14:00] hour what you shall speak okay
[1:14:05] hey they picked it up all right now pick
[1:14:09] up the next one go to Matthew mark 13
[1:14:11] and 11 so we'll have that one huh you
[1:14:15] put it on another mark but when they
[1:14:18] cells marker let the 13 11 when they
[1:14:21] shall lead you and deliver you up
[1:14:24] same basic thought here don't watch what
[1:14:27] he said take no thought beforehand what
[1:14:30] you shall speak neither do you
[1:14:34] premeditate but whatsoever shall be
[1:14:39] given you in that hour that speak II for
[1:14:48] it is not ye that speak but the Holy
[1:14:52] Ghost it's the Holy Ghost that does it
[1:14:57] speaking so now the difference between
[1:15:00] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:15:02] there we go it's you talking a
[1:15:04] justification of sanctification but when
[1:15:08] you receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:15:09] Ghost it's not you talking is him
[1:15:13] talking now let me I'll put it this way
[1:15:15] if I go out and blab something that
[1:15:17] ain't right it ain't him
[1:15:20] is that it clear enough if I blab
[1:15:24] something that ain't right it ain't him
[1:15:26] well brother Lu said that was God well I
[1:15:29] just lied if it wasn't but I also know
[1:15:34] that even baby
[1:15:35] Balaam prophesied of the coming of the
[1:15:37] Lord am i right Balaam a false prophet
[1:15:39] it's written in God's Word what he said
[1:15:41] about God
[1:15:43] Balaam so God can use a dumbass to speak
[1:15:49] he did through the Prophet to tell him
[1:15:52] that he's gonna kill him he didn't stand
[1:15:54] back from that all right let's continue
[1:15:57] on go to number 8
[1:16:00] brother the power of the devil is the
[1:16:04] title of the message 55 jesus said
[1:16:08] except a man be born again he cannot
[1:16:10] understand the kingdom of heaven now
[1:16:13] chose these because of different wording
[1:16:16] not just to get this word up here
[1:16:19] different wordings brings better
[1:16:22] thoughts than just reading one talk he
[1:16:27] cannot understand the kingdom of heaven
[1:16:30] except a man be born again there's no
[1:16:33] way of understanding it until you're
[1:16:35] born again then God reveals himself to
[1:16:39] you and then you know what your Pais you
[1:16:43] know that you've passed from death unto
[1:16:46] life because no man can call Jesus
[1:16:48] Christ only by the Holy Spirit so you
[1:16:52] know you've pipes because of what's
[1:16:53] happening if something inside of you
[1:16:55] speaking the only way that you'll ever
[1:16:58] know that Jesus is the Christ is when
[1:17:04] the Holy Spirit personally witnesses to
[1:17:07] you that he is the resurrected Lord
[1:17:10] Jesus they ever spoke to you anything
[1:17:16] never spoke to you about the
[1:17:17] resurrection in him saying no matter
[1:17:20] what he would do what kind of signs what
[1:17:23] kind of miracles you'll never know it
[1:17:25] until your personal experience with God
[1:17:29] good point
[1:17:30] right
[1:17:31] go ahead earnestly contending for the
[1:17:34] faith Paul were down here in the natural
[1:17:38] realm with a PhD and he didn't know he
[1:17:40] had an intellectual faith but he didn't
[1:17:42] have a divine faith there's quite a
[1:17:45] difference in me having an intellectual
[1:17:47] faith than a divine faith there's were
[1:17:51] you my Baptist friends failed to go on
[1:17:53] you get the intellectual faith by that
[1:17:55] but it must be a divine revelation of
[1:17:58] Jesus Christ to you that just came out
[1:18:01] that Christ to you that just came out of
[1:18:06] the heart the intellectual faith is not
[1:18:08] enough
[1:18:09] that's alright but it only brings you to
[1:18:12] the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit is a
[1:18:15] personal experience of the birth the new
[1:18:19] birth regeneration making a new creature
[1:18:22] in Christ
[1:18:23] 55 he's still going huh Patmos vision
[1:18:37] 1960 now ask God what we're talking on
[1:18:43] Revelation ask him to give you a
[1:18:45] revelation of this where can only be
[1:18:50] known by revelation you can only be
[1:18:56] saved by revelation so then why wouldn't
[1:19:03] your thoughts be then when the Prophet
[1:19:05] would say the new birth is revelation
[1:19:07] Jesus Christ personally to you why would
[1:19:09] you not want to get into that to see
[1:19:12] that I can go home today
[1:19:14] and I can read the Bible and God can
[1:19:17] speak to me and you know what that's
[1:19:19] more than my life what he reveals to me
[1:19:22] is part of my life
[1:19:24] it's part of something happening he's
[1:19:26] revealing this after me why is it would
[1:19:31] to be any problem with it to believe
[1:19:33] that the new birth the morning any
[1:19:35] experience the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:19:37] would be a revelation to you remember
[1:19:44] Jesus talking to the disciples he said
[1:19:49] when he the Holy Ghost has come he'll
[1:19:53] bring to your remembrance whatsoever I
[1:19:55] say it putting two scriptures together
[1:19:58] and brother branham's wording and said
[1:20:00] even teach you things to come brother in
[1:20:02] cities not only brought through there
[1:20:03] what he had said but he said taught him
[1:20:05] greater things right well why don't you
[1:20:10] want to believe that the new birth is a
[1:20:11] revelation
[1:20:12] I thought we believe that the new birth
[1:20:17] was a birth of the word that's what I've
[1:20:22] always taught you that's what I've
[1:20:24] always believed the new birth is the
[1:20:26] birth of the word you go into the
[1:20:28] Gospels with that and the son of man is
[1:20:31] the only store of the seed and he sowed
[1:20:34] you and some kept the word some
[1:20:38] understood the word I'm giving you two
[1:20:40] or three marks into the Gospels but then
[1:20:43] the Holy Ghost came and quickened that
[1:20:44] word to those disciples the next message
[1:20:53] I don't got it because when they got to
[1:20:56] the day of Pentecost what'd he say he
[1:20:59] said this is that that was revealed to
[1:21:07] the prophets and what you have a
[1:21:16] knowledge of it you can only be saved by
[1:21:18] revelation you have a knowledge of it
[1:21:20] intellectually but you can't be saved
[1:21:22] until it's revealed to you
[1:21:23] no man can call Jesus the Christ only by
[1:21:26] the Holy Ghost can I reinstate a word
[1:21:29] and I said want to know I had druther
[1:21:32] have as my experience something that I
[1:21:37] can remember when he spoke to my heart
[1:21:39] and called me to him and I fathered him
[1:21:45] I didn't have the sensation got it now
[1:21:49] the manifestation I just followed him
[1:21:56] man said nothing I'm funny unknown I'm
[1:21:59] carnal about the way I think
[1:22:01] but now let's do it like this you know
[1:22:03] here's Peter and James and John and and
[1:22:06] he goes over to Peter and he says come
[1:22:10] follow me now he didn't sit down with
[1:22:14] him and spend three weeks now I want to
[1:22:16] explain to you what I'm gonna do and
[1:22:18] we're gonna do this we're gonna go
[1:22:19] through this we're gonna do this we're
[1:22:21] gonna go through then then you're gonna
[1:22:22] finally get to believe in it he says
[1:22:24] come follow me James come follow me he
[1:22:29] never explained what he wanted him to do
[1:22:32] he never gave him a great thing but then
[1:22:36] when they got with him for three and a
[1:22:40] half years he explained the kingdom he
[1:22:44] explained the new birth he explained all
[1:22:47] of those things to him but they still
[1:22:49] couldn't understand it
[1:22:51] until the Holy Ghost came and that's why
[1:22:54] he said it he said when I come back in
[1:22:57] other words I'm going away and when I
[1:22:58] come back as an indwelling in you call
[1:23:00] remember the teachers inside that when I
[1:23:03] come back and not dwell in you how brain
[1:23:06] do you remembers what I've said what a
[1:23:08] Peter say Peter's in there one of them
[1:23:13] to you he said yes Peter cuz he said
[1:23:16] they said what can we do he said I don't
[1:23:18] know what's going on I don't understand
[1:23:20] all they've done the one thing for sure
[1:23:21] this is that I like brother branham's on
[1:23:26] that don't you
[1:23:27] if this ain't that I'll just stay with
[1:23:29] this you've gone to all yo - she wants
[1:23:32] to I'm just gonna stay with this huh so
[1:23:37] half of word we get - he cannot
[1:23:40] understand the kingdom of God all right
[1:23:43] we're still on the Patmos vision that's
[1:23:46] what the Bible says no man can say Jesus
[1:23:48] is the Christ until he has received the
[1:23:51] Holy Ghost and what are you doing he
[1:23:55] might say the pastor said so the Bible
[1:23:57] says so they were truth the church says
[1:24:01] so that is true but you don't know
[1:24:03] yourself until the Holy Ghost has
[1:24:05] revealed it to
[1:24:07] and he's become in you it's an inside
[1:24:16] teacher right come on
[1:24:21] I don't mind quote in the scripture it's
[1:24:26] an inside teacher said you don't need
[1:24:29] one teach you I scripture said you don't
[1:24:35] need me then now we've got their answer
[1:24:38] to that right
[1:24:38] we Baptist we had an argument over that
[1:24:40] we don't need teaching so brother
[1:24:43] they're your teacher so we don't need
[1:24:44] your ministry
[1:24:44] we'll get these others you know
[1:24:47] something like it I'm 77 years old but I
[1:24:52] still have a memory no man could call
[1:24:54] Jesus of Christ only by the Holy Ghost
[1:24:56] not by knowledge not by intellectual now
[1:25:01] that word we get to okay jump over now
[1:25:05] and we'll get to get to number 14 what
[1:25:18] they're doing good that's when the
[1:25:21] master called faith 1950 say and if
[1:25:24] you've never had the Holy Spirit no man
[1:25:28] can even call Jesus the Christ only by
[1:25:31] the Holy Spirit
[1:25:32] oh you say but you might say the
[1:25:34] preachers hit I read in the Bible that's
[1:25:36] all true but that don't but you don't
[1:25:38] know it yourself until you've
[1:25:40] experienced the Bible said that you
[1:25:43] can't know that Jesus is the Christ only
[1:25:45] by the Holy Spirit that's right that's
[1:25:50] truth okay then we went through 14 or
[1:25:56] did we pick back up yeah
[1:25:59] 15 infallible proof of the resurrection
[1:26:05] when the blood of blood sale of Emanuel
[1:26:08] was broken then his spirit the life that
[1:26:10] was in the blood sale of Emmanuel
[1:26:11] returns back which is none other than
[1:26:14] the Holy Spirit itself now may I quote
[1:26:17] brother Branham he said he sent back his
[1:26:18] soul in the form of the baptism
[1:26:20] the ghost that comes and dwells in each
[1:26:22] one of us diversity new birth the new
[1:26:25] birth is Christ coming in you and living
[1:26:29] outwardly okay and the work for shipper
[1:26:34] once with the Holy Spirit in him his
[1:26:37] heart becomes changed now not from an
[1:26:41] intellectual view of the Bible or a
[1:26:42] concept or in Crete but from an
[1:26:45] experience they don't change this
[1:26:48] Creed's and ideas with an experience
[1:26:50] when we're witness of the resurrection
[1:26:52] you know that your resurrection is
[1:26:54] inside of you you have the new birth
[1:26:56] today your resurrection is inside of you
[1:26:58] where's it coming from if it not in you
[1:27:01] you're my witnesses after the Holy
[1:27:03] Spirit is come upon you not until the
[1:27:05] Holy Spirit comes where they were
[1:27:07] witnesses they could not witness until
[1:27:10] the Holy Spirit for he is the witness
[1:27:12] the Bible says no man can call Jesus to
[1:27:15] cry only by the Holy Spirit what about
[1:27:18] it what about it how about me just
[1:27:28] cutting off and picking up next Sunday
[1:27:32] right where we left off so musicians
[1:27:38] come on while they're coming let me
[1:27:41] emphasize or a reenter rate or at what
[1:27:44] some great words are for let me go back
[1:27:46] over a little I like to do that because
[1:27:48] see people get lost in what you're
[1:27:50] saying because their mind is running on
[1:27:52] one channel and you say something and
[1:27:54] that mind hooks it on to that channel
[1:27:56] and you don't even her hear what the
[1:27:58] person says now I'm 77 years old and I
[1:28:03] know that when I fifteen you ought to
[1:28:06] know it now you or talk to somebody
[1:28:10] named looking dead at you you ever talk
[1:28:13] to them them looking dead after you just
[1:28:14] talking away and they're looking right
[1:28:16] in your own eyes
[1:28:18] and you turn walk on this what you say
[1:28:21] I'm hear a word you say right see what
[1:28:26] you talking about
[1:28:27] I didn't hear you say that why cause the
[1:28:29] mind blocked out but remember the point
[1:28:34] you cannot call Jesus the Christ unless
[1:28:38] it be by the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:28:40] not what somebody up says and I'll
[1:28:43] listen
[1:28:43] not what brother Branham said not what
[1:28:47] the Bible says not what God says right
[1:28:54] but then the key to the whole thing is
[1:28:57] the inward experience putting the Holy
[1:29:00] Spirit inside of you and we read it from
[1:29:03] Mark then it's not you but it's the Holy
[1:29:08] Spirit in you speaking out as I said
[1:29:15] while ago he could come back and you
[1:29:17] think we don't look at the Old Testament
[1:29:19] as God being able to use there but he
[1:29:20] entered into to David and he'd say they
[1:29:28] pierced my hands and my feet right
[1:29:33] preaching exactly Jesus Christ and what
[1:29:36] would happen but you know what he also
[1:29:39] as I said while ago spoke through Balaam
[1:29:42] and spoke to the coming of Jesus Christ
[1:29:47] why because the inside of the man
[1:29:49] wouldn't drive but David knew those
[1:29:55] people back dark thinks you just see
[1:29:56] that Old Testament we should think a
[1:29:58] little that that long in within man's
[1:30:02] heart
[1:30:04] to know about God and you know what the
[1:30:08] Bible says he said I'm sick of your your
[1:30:13] sacrifices and your offerings and now
[1:30:14] I'm quoting scripture he said what a man
[1:30:17] with an honest and a contrite heart what
[1:30:22] was David an adulteress of murderer but
[1:30:29] only his way home from the bed of
[1:30:30] Bathsheba brother Branham says if
[1:30:32] Scofield gives it to you on his way home
[1:30:35] from the bed of Bathsheba he's crying
[1:30:38] out return unto me the joy in other
[1:30:41] words come Lord and do something for me
[1:30:43] I can't help these things there's tildes
[1:30:45] they're coming back I can get rid of
[1:30:47] them for
[1:30:48] while I can move out into anointings and
[1:30:51] dying but I cannot keep it it just
[1:30:54] floats away from me
[1:30:55] don't you understand yet he could
[1:30:58] prophesy exactly like they pierce my
[1:31:01] till a man over and what is it only in
[1:31:04] the book of Acts and he was referring
[1:31:06] back he said is this man talking about
[1:31:08] himself or another till David was so
[1:31:11] much he's speaking the first person yet
[1:31:17] he couldn't be warned again because
[1:31:20] Jesus Christ had not died may I quote
[1:31:24] brother Branham he said if he could do
[1:31:27] those things back daraa what about under
[1:31:31] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the New
[1:31:34] Testament can you say that Jesus Christ
[1:31:40] is in you then there's one thing for
[1:31:48] surely we can't do we can't turn down
[1:31:50] the word yeah but I don't believe you
[1:31:56] brought the word with no problem cuz
[1:31:59] that ain't mine
[1:32:03] I'm just asking you a simple little
[1:32:05] thought you might have been 10 11 years
[1:32:08] old a lot of you was when you said you
[1:32:10] receive the new birth and I believe in
[1:32:12] that you didn't have to have this great
[1:32:14] revelation or the deity of Jesus Christ
[1:32:16] being this that or the other but you had
[1:32:18] a revelation at one time if it was
[1:32:21] genuine you had a revelation that you've
[1:32:22] lost you had a thought coming in you
[1:32:25] mentally that you was lost you got it
[1:32:29] from somebody and hearing it and you
[1:32:31] said you've lost and then you went to
[1:32:33] the altar and said I want to accept
[1:32:35] Jesus Christ as my savior I believe in
[1:32:38] that I believe that happened I believe
[1:32:41] it happens right over there in that
[1:32:42] church I believe it happens in the
[1:32:45] Baptist cemented discipline a call from
[1:32:47] the Catholics and evidence that a child
[1:32:49] can come to a basis of understanding
[1:32:52] that you need to be saved
[1:32:55] we've listened to Billy Graham the other
[1:32:57] day and brother Branham on the you know
[1:32:59] the testimonies I and brother Owen said
[1:33:01] ain't nobody
[1:33:02] the message of salvation no greater than
[1:33:04] Billy Graham because he could just stand
[1:33:06] right there and he could bring 500,000
[1:33:10] people I was listening to him in one
[1:33:15] place I didn't think he was that
[1:33:18] spiritual I'm not saying I'm wrong about
[1:33:20] him just saying the truth but he said I
[1:33:22] announced when I came here he's gonna be
[1:33:26] there like a couple of weeks you know
[1:33:28] for the campaign he said they won't let
[1:33:32] me close he said I went back to the
[1:33:37] board and asked him and he said today he
[1:33:45] said we'll be here through the month of
[1:33:47] August he could bring the gospel to get
[1:33:54] people to make a committed commitment of
[1:33:57] accepting Jesus Christ but what did he
[1:34:00] say they just wouldn't anybody to take
[1:34:01] it on any further because why they went
[1:34:04] back to their church that next week and
[1:34:06] they said we'd like to know more about
[1:34:08] yourself we got it when you believe what
[1:34:12] do you want see blind to poor people I
[1:34:16] never will forget brother mo what he was
[1:34:19] saying to come with you Stan he said you
[1:34:21] know what kind of a main person kind of
[1:34:23] talking off on Joyce in Holland they
[1:34:25] know about him but he said uh he he told
[1:34:30] me one time he said he said I got saved
[1:34:35] and he said I thought everybody in the
[1:34:38] communities want to go want to know that
[1:34:40] early smoked got saved he said I went
[1:34:44] around and told them people that I got
[1:34:47] say he said they wasn't too happy you
[1:34:53] know what that means don't you if you
[1:34:56] really get saved you're gonna lose your
[1:34:57] buddies and they're not happy cuz you
[1:34:59] lose them right but think about it
[1:35:02] what about your experience I'm not
[1:35:06] talking about God coming down in
[1:35:08] revealing great seals and plagues and
[1:35:11] trumpets and vials and time that was
[1:35:13] revealed to the Prophet but he can
[1:35:14] reveal to you
[1:35:16] said this morning but that was god what
[1:35:21] can't you take that is something I'd
[1:35:24] rather have that than all experiences
[1:35:25] are shouting speaking in - you
[1:35:27] understand what I'm talking not woody
[1:35:29] many would like to had to experience I
[1:35:31] had at 11 years old to see God in a
[1:35:33] church but when I saw this message and
[1:35:37] what I didn't in the babies I didn't
[1:35:39] count that my salvation but there's no
[1:35:45] way you can talk me out of that but you
[1:35:52] see if your experience stops then
[1:35:57] there's something wrong with your
[1:35:57] experience you go so far down the road
[1:36:02] and then you backslide
[1:36:04] there's something wrong
[1:36:09] something's wrong no salvation is
[1:36:13] supposed to carry us through go ahead
[1:36:17] what would God
[1:36:21] [Music]
[1:36:25] and I began to cry
[1:36:33] in my mind by anybody have a need
