[6:08] start believing that bless I uh God
[6:12] bless you bless you buddy love you
[6:14] appreciate everybody here thank you for
[6:16] your prayers I had a headache don't have
[6:19] one now
[6:22] so it was a sick one I mean I was sick
[6:25] in my stomach that usually doesn't
[6:27] happen but uh thank you for your prayer
[6:29] even though the ones of you that didn't
[6:31] know I did you prayed for me anyway so
[6:34] so we thank God for that if you have
[6:35] your Bibles turn to the book of First
[6:37] Corinthians just for one
[6:40] scripture and get started um this will
[6:44] be the Journey of a Christian part
[6:47] three uh part one and two was a couple
[6:49] of Sundays ago for those of you that
[6:52] missed it you'll just have to get the
[6:53] tape I can't background much cuz if
[6:55] you'll remember right at the end I kind
[6:57] of rushed through and I want to kind of
[6:59] back up a little bit right what I want
[7:01] to do tonight is I want to
[7:04] start at chapter 17 of Genesis but don't
[7:08] turn there now but where the new birth
[7:11] and type
[7:12] begins and then go through the latter
[7:15] part of Abraham's life and
[7:17] then you know you you want to
[7:21] uh uh you know you see what the Old
[7:23] Testament says about Abraham right he
[7:27] laughed at God he gave his wife away
[7:29] away gave her away twice tried to and
[7:34] how God preserved Abraham and his seed
[7:37] but now remember Galatians says the
[7:39] promise is not to the seed singular the
[7:41] seed one I mean the seed as of many
[7:44] which was the seeds of Abraham the
[7:46] natural seed the natural genetics of of
[7:50] Abraham we're going to read tonight in
[7:52] Romans 4 and in Galatians where Paul
[7:55] picks up the spiritual part of that that
[7:58] you and I need to look at if you and I
[8:00] were an observer of Abraham and Abram of
[8:03] course if you were an observer of of
[8:05] Abram you probably would not have
[8:08] understood his
[8:09] journey by just looking at Abram because
[8:12] you know Abram had lot with him and lot
[8:14] was always a thorn in the flesh for him
[8:16] a little bit but we're going to find out
[8:18] too that lot was a righteous man oh yeah
[8:22] we're going to find out too that even
[8:23] though ishma was the wrong son God
[8:26] blessed him right so see it's not all
[8:30] that that that uh uh doesn't seem on the
[8:34] surface a lot of things that that we
[8:35] look at but but we want to kind of
[8:37] broaden our scope a little bit of Abram
[8:40] and Abraham but let's read this first in
[8:43] First Corinthians because I believe if
[8:44] we'll if we'll see this excuse me then
[8:48] we will then we'll see what the pretense
[8:52] of Paul's writings in the New Testament
[8:56] will give us because you can't take
[8:58] everything
[9:01] and make it an example of Christianity
[9:03] that happened in the Old Testament right
[9:05] but in First Corinthians let's pray
[9:08] before we get
[9:09] started dear heavenly father we come to
[9:12] you tonight Lord with Humble Hearts and
[9:15] and open ears Lord that you may speak to
[9:18] us Lord what we need in this end time
[9:20] yes Father we pray that you would just
[9:23] consecrate us now Lord just take care of
[9:25] us bless us yes be with us Lord be with
[9:28] the con conation Lord may you not be
[9:31] Lord a bystander but be an active
[9:33] participant and Lord may you come down
[9:35] and and be Lord one that opens the eyes
[9:39] and one that opens the ears and the one
[9:41] that does the speaking Lord be the one
[9:44] that that looks Through The Eyes of
[9:46] Faith as Abraham did Lord looking at the
[9:50] promise looking at a city Lord who
[9:52] Builder maker was God but not being able
[9:55] to complete that Lord It's given to us
[9:57] in the end time to complete that mission
[10:00] Lord we pray that You' just be with the
[10:02] sick among us father you said you sent
[10:04] your word and healed us Lord and
[10:05] delivered us from our destruction Lord
[10:08] and as the word Goes Forth father we ask
[10:10] that many times we we see that you've
[10:13] just come down and healed us father and
[10:15] touched us and Lord what greater healing
[10:19] Lord would be than the healing of our
[10:21] soul that Lord some of them that are sin
[10:23] sick father that that don't have you
[10:25] Lord that that don't have that promise
[10:28] Lord we pray now that you would just
[10:30] fill them with the Holy Spirit Lord that
[10:33] we'll be able to understand you tonight
[10:35] Lord be able to understand what you're
[10:36] saying to his father you said Lord that
[10:39] you would be with us you said you'd
[10:41] leave us and never forsake us we depend
[10:44] on that Lord we depend on you today Lord
[10:48] in Jesus name amen amen First
[10:52] Corinthians chap 10: 11 now all these
[10:56] things wow all these things it's talking
[11:00] about Moses but all these things what
[11:01] the old things in the Old Testament
[11:04] happened unto them for example and they
[11:07] are written for would you like to say
[11:10] that for me they were written for
[11:13] our kind of makes it personal doesn't it
[11:15] right upon whom the ends of the world
[11:18] are come that's um you and I if you
[11:21] don't realize we're in the end time now
[11:24] let's go
[11:25] to Genesis oh you may be
[11:27] seated I want I want you to see that
[11:30] that even Paul was looking let's go back
[11:32] to for the sake of the ones that that
[11:36] are that haven't didn't come on Sunday
[11:39] or or was out or sick or or for whatever
[11:42] reason I want you to realize one
[11:46] thing that God is not a respector of
[11:49] person amen amen God did not pick Abram
[11:52] over anybody else he had to give
[11:55] everybody an opportunity Glory during
[11:58] that time of Abram I'm like brother Dale
[12:01] I believe God spoke to many people right
[12:04] now the only one that it did any good
[12:06] was the one that took it and held it
[12:08] like Mary did in her heart and held it
[12:12] and continued on what did the brother
[12:14] Rand say that the reason that God gave
[12:17] Abraham the promise was he knew that
[12:19] Abraham would take what he was told amen
[12:22] and give it to the future generation all
[12:25] right he wouldn't be a selfish person
[12:27] and keep all this
[12:29] for itself but now I don't believe Abram
[12:32] just comes up one day and Abram
[12:35] says I'm going to walk through
[12:37] justification Abram didn't know anything
[12:39] about justification Abram didn't know
[12:41] anything about sanctification Abraham
[12:43] didn't know anything about the new birth
[12:45] but there's one thing Abraham and Abram
[12:46] knew that they walked through life they
[12:49] walked a journey amen right through life
[12:52] not knowing maybe that you and I that he
[12:54] was going to be an example right I don't
[12:56] think he got up every morning and said
[12:58] well boy
[12:59] and when two 10,000 or 5,000 years from
[13:02] now when these people get on the earth
[13:05] no he just walked with God right all
[13:08] right now I want you to keep this in the
[13:09] back of your mind now this is kind of
[13:11] strange that I was going to use brother
[13:13] Chris for an example cuz he usually
[13:14] doesn't come on Wednesday nights and
[13:16] he's
[13:19] here he told me today he said I'm coming
[13:22] I said oh well okay but I didn't say
[13:25] anymore but you know look at Abram and
[13:27] I'm going to use brother Chris in this
[13:28] journey I may not use him all cuz cuz
[13:31] you know he may not be all the way
[13:32] through that
[13:33] Journey but you know there was this man
[13:37] named Elijah one time the Bible just
[13:40] said
[13:42] Elijah with a Tish
[13:44] bite there was no genealogy there was no
[13:47] great mom and daddy there was no great
[13:50] life before all of a sudden Elijah
[13:54] appears in the Bible right now Abram had
[13:57] a genealogy from sham
[14:00] but here Abram comes up one day and he
[14:02] disappears yeah God said get up and
[14:07] leave right and I was thinking about
[14:09] that after I finished the service
[14:11] Sunday that you know you see brother
[14:14] Chris and I told him when he got
[14:15] finished playing after that after that
[14:17] great um sermon that he preached for
[14:20] Sunday he said that's not right well
[14:23] it's a Ministry whether you like it or
[14:25] not he preached his first sermon last
[14:27] Sunday you know because it was Ministry
[14:30] all right and he told us this week he
[14:32] said he wondered all the to he told us
[14:34] outside afterwards he had wondered why
[14:36] that God had given or maybe not God or
[14:37] why he had this gift right right what
[14:41] what am I doing with this gift why am I
[14:43] why is this this way well he proved that
[14:47] Sunday but all but see now look 6 months
[14:51] ago I told Tyler he need to stay up here
[14:54] today Richard's back in the back this is
[14:57] okay listen he said sister Gail can do
[15:00] it I said she can't get up and down that
[15:01] many times to change the
[15:04] camera
[15:06] but one
[15:08] day a year ago this time a year ago
[15:12] Chris wasn't here right Chris was just
[15:15] who Abram right Chris right he wasn't a
[15:19] brother he was just Chris
[15:22] yeah one day God said
[15:26] Chris start talking to these two guys
[15:29] right here for those of you that don't
[15:30] know brother Chris works with us with
[15:32] brother uh whatever his name is brother
[15:34] Mark and brother Donnie so you know he
[15:38] wasn't in the mix are you catching what
[15:40] I'm tell what I'm saying here we may not
[15:42] even finish this this what my head was
[15:44] killing me before service and I kind of
[15:45] laid down for about 30 minutes didn't
[15:47] write a note today so I got a few notes
[15:50] now but they're they consist of one
[15:52] sticky
[15:53] note so but anyway so but brother Chris
[15:58] wasn't here
[16:01] he wasn't among the
[16:03] Brethren sisters right when they
[16:07] appear why he appear
[16:11] right many are called right but few were
[16:16] chosen many in Abram's time was
[16:20] called even
[16:22] lot I believe lot was called cuz the
[16:25] scripture the Eternal Word said lot was
[16:28] just sure so lot was justified
[16:31] right lived in a Justified condition but
[16:34] he didn't go on and so ish the same way
[16:37] ish was blessed of God sure and we
[16:40] talking about that today you can be
[16:42] blessed and not be a Christian right so
[16:45] don't think ishma was blessed of God but
[16:47] he was blessed of God but he wasn't
[16:49] blessed with the promise right that's
[16:52] the difference
[16:54] right see brother our our U John dou
[17:00] could be
[17:02] blessed but brother Chris was blessed
[17:05] with a promise amen he accepted what God
[17:09] said to him am I too loud what God said
[17:13] to him I thank God I didn't speak this
[17:16] loud my head was killing me a minute
[17:19] ago but here's this man that
[17:22] appears sorry buddy I was going to use
[17:24] you you weren't here but you're here so
[17:29] right maybe he need I got a living
[17:31] example exactly right I got a living
[17:34] example but no he wasn't
[17:37] here and then all of a sudden now he's
[17:40] here why he answered a call right right
[17:45] he answer God spoke and he answered
[17:47] Abram all right justification chapter 12
[17:51] now the Lord had said unto Abram get out
[17:53] of the country right leave your
[17:57] people leave what what you're doing
[18:00] right and now this man Abram
[18:03] appears and he just starts on a journey
[18:06] right he goes to
[18:09] work about
[18:12] 9:00 which is banking
[18:16] hours but you understand what I'm saying
[18:18] I don't want you to to to think about
[18:21] Abram and Abraham and think oh this
[18:24] great man and this great journey he was
[18:27] so pck
[18:32] pick might sound good he was so picked
[18:35] of God no he was ABR right right because
[18:40] God can't be a respector a person
[18:43] exactly right right right but Abram
[18:46] accepted and therefore that put him in a
[18:49] journey amen
[18:51] amen Danny Fon wasn't here for a while
[18:55] right wait they wasn't even here for a
[18:56] while right am man some have been here
[18:59] brother collie's been here some of you's
[19:00] been here for a long time but all of a
[19:04] sudden we start appearing right and when
[19:08] we start appearing We Begin into a
[19:11] journey Abram Abram Chris begins into a
[19:16] journey right and that Journey takes him
[19:19] through life and God is maybe not
[19:21] audibly saying Chris do this Chris do
[19:25] that we all have them little things in
[19:27] our head every once in a while do this
[19:29] don't do this don't do this do but you
[19:31] know what I think what Abram realized
[19:35] whoever was talking to him it was
[19:38] consistent right yeah right it was
[19:41] consistent with now remember they were
[19:44] uh you know the Bible says men of old
[19:45] Renown they didn't have they weren't
[19:47] under the law right the law didn't come
[19:50] into effect till till Moses but we're
[19:53] going to read when when Paul brings this
[19:56] all
[19:57] together we he will talk about the law
[19:59] and he'll talk about Abram and Abraham
[20:02] according to the flesh then he's going
[20:03] to bring it to Abraham according to the
[20:05] word of God right and Daddy was almost
[20:07] getting ready to preach it Sunday he
[20:09] read some of the same scriptures I was
[20:10] going to finish with so if he would have
[20:12] finished I wouldn't had have done this
[20:13] so it's his
[20:16] fault but Abram Abraham according to the
[20:19] flesh was no better than you and I
[20:21] exactly right according to the flesh
[20:24] amen he was no better than the rest of
[20:27] us brother Chris was No Better In the
[20:29] Flesh better no better than the next guy
[20:32] that somebody you know that you know you
[20:34] can just call a name Fred Tom John
[20:38] right but what's wrong with what's
[20:40] what's
[20:42] Chris I'm not calling him brother yet
[20:45] hold on Chris cuz Abram was Abram then
[20:49] he became Abra became Abram right there
[20:53] not say not to call a brother brother
[20:54] before he's born again but you
[20:55] understand what I'm saying there's a
[20:56] there's a there's a development of a
[20:58] name here right Abram was Abram Abram
[21:02] had problem Abram heard God but he did a
[21:06] lot of things on his own God told him to
[21:08] separate he did but he took lot with him
[21:12] right right so he's got problems
[21:15] remember we already been through this
[21:16] I'm kind of get get everybody caught up
[21:18] cuz in justification you're you're
[21:20] you're you're just you're new um you you
[21:24] like a little baby you stumble and you
[21:26] fall and and and then God picks you up
[21:29] and here you go on your journey again
[21:31] and man you'll hit a brick wall and and
[21:34] and fall backwards and think where did
[21:36] that come from and it's going to happen
[21:38] don't worry
[21:39] yeah but brother Chris goes into a walk
[21:42] of
[21:43] God that nobody else can walk right
[21:47] that's right Glory there's not one ABR
[21:50] that's right there's only one Donnie
[21:52] fall Bush right there's only one Tommy
[21:56] FSH right right
[21:59] there's only one there was only one
[22:01] Abram
[22:03] right you know Danny I got to thinking
[22:05] the other day I think about the our walk
[22:07] in life mine and yours you know how we
[22:10] fished and did all the things before and
[22:13] how that we kind of kind of hung
[22:16] together there for a while but then we
[22:17] kind of got separated cuz we did you
[22:19] know we were doing other things but how
[22:20] this is more special to me now then when
[22:24] me and you fished for geez we caught 300
[22:27] fish one year we we fish till we fish
[22:30] till we fish till we fish till we fish
[22:33] but you know this is more special now
[22:36] amen right and even then right and even
[22:39] in Abram's Journey Abram probably did a
[22:41] lot of things in life that he really
[22:43] enjoyed and really loved but when he
[22:45] started with this walk here's my point
[22:46] when he started that walk with God he
[22:48] was focused right now sure his Focus may
[22:51] be a little out of
[22:52] focus right right he took lot give his
[22:56] life away give his wife away
[22:59] give um uh didn't understand really what
[23:02] God was talking about have we all been
[23:03] that way didn't understand what God was
[23:06] talking about so he so he went into his
[23:07] bond woman and had a child thought that
[23:11] was the promised child yeah said all
[23:14] that is may walk before you kind of
[23:16] cloudy in his in his revelation we all
[23:19] that way right right we all got a little
[23:21] clouds in our
[23:23] Revelation I'm trying to hurry through
[23:25] but Genesis 12 1314 watch now that
[23:29] Abram God does one
[23:32] thing I want you to get this tonight God
[23:34] does one thing for Abram He blesses him
[23:37] amen
[23:39] right even in
[23:41] Abram's terrible condition which we say
[23:44] he he he did a lot of things wrong God
[23:47] everywhere Abram went God blessed him
[23:51] right even when you come to Abram in
[23:54] sanctification God everywhere he went
[23:57] you remember he went down to pharaoh and
[23:58] gave his wife away what did the Bible
[24:00] say I read it
[24:02] Sunday Pharaoh just gave him half the
[24:04] kingdom said here here horses cattle
[24:07] gold silver just said here this is yours
[24:11] yeah I mean Pharaoh's fixing the T I
[24:14] mean that this guy lied to
[24:16] Pharaoh said this is my
[24:19] sister and Pharaoh's a little bit
[24:22] confused but you know what in God always
[24:25] Christians are odd right amen all of our
[24:27] walking life has always been odd we've
[24:30] always been oddballs which is fine with
[24:32] me that but remember and I wrote this
[24:37] down God blessed
[24:40] Abram all the way
[24:43] through now remember in chapter 13: 6
[24:48] the land was not able to Bear Abram and
[24:51] lot it was they were so blessed with
[24:54] cattle right you understand what I'm
[24:56] saying God is going to bless you if you
[24:59] continue on your journey amen that's
[25:01] right exactly see I like somebody like
[25:03] brother Chris that comes in and and he
[25:07] he sits
[25:12] there then all of a
[25:15] sudden light comes on
[25:18] right how many people have you seen come
[25:20] in now look watch AEL my point is Abram
[25:23] didn't jump up in Genesis 15 or 12 and
[25:26] go Glory Glory this is it I'm not no he
[25:29] didn't he just got up and walked and he
[25:32] got the D he went down to Egypt he went
[25:35] to Canaan he went back to bethl he went
[25:37] back to Canaan he was just but he was
[25:39] moving amen but he was moving right he
[25:43] was moving he had a goal he had an
[25:46] objective and he was moving he was
[25:48] continually at least he was
[25:50] trying even though through all the
[25:54] mistakes but remember one thing
[25:58] God still blessed him amen God still
[26:01] blessed him
[26:03] right he was not a son of God by birth
[26:06] you understand that but he was a Son of
[26:09] God that God was taking care of at the
[26:10] time he was not a son of God by birth
[26:13] all right he wasn't a born again
[26:14] Christian but God was so pleased with
[26:17] Abram
[26:19] Abram cuz remember mzc met Abram right
[26:25] in justification right go God I don't
[26:29] know where they did it for you but see
[26:32] God had to help me through a lot of
[26:34] these stages sure amen that's right cuz
[26:37] I couldn't help myself remember that's
[26:39] right amen I couldn't do this on my own
[26:42] that's right Abram was just fling around
[26:45] and all of a sudden God called him but
[26:47] God said okay I know you're going to
[26:49] make it Abram that's right cuz I'm all
[26:51] knowing right but you just don't know
[26:53] you're going to make it right but when
[26:55] you know that you're going to make it
[26:58] you you're going to be solid right same
[27:00] way with somebody like brother Chris
[27:02] same way a lot of us a lot of us come in
[27:04] kicking and
[27:06] screaming right amen that's right I mean
[27:09] sure you come under this gospel and it's
[27:11] the greatest thing since since sliced
[27:13] bread and you think man this is this is
[27:16] it but you stay there and you sit there
[27:20] right and you continue moving amen Abram
[27:23] continued he moved straight on and God
[27:26] met him and served in community
[27:29] right in justification right in other
[27:32] words God said hey this guy I'm putting
[27:36] my stamp on Amen now I'm using brother
[27:39] Chris for an example but it's this
[27:40] should be all of our examples right
[27:43] exactly reason I'm using him as he's
[27:45] kind of the newest guy on the Block the
[27:46] newest one in you
[27:49] know all of us were the same way right
[27:52] amen but he
[27:54] appears among the
[27:56] congregation and any begins to
[27:59] play it begins to play the instrument
[28:03] hey Abram's a pretty nice guy right amen
[28:07] let's let him play a little bit right
[28:10] let's let him enter into worship a
[28:12] little bit right okay you mind is that
[28:15] okay I don't beat me tomorrow
[28:21] okay but you watch you watch somebody
[28:24] moving and honest to goodness some of
[28:27] you hadn't moved in 20
[28:32] years I've known you for 12 in this
[28:35] church you got to keep moving amen you
[28:39] got to have a Zeal and a fire yes that's
[28:42] right that's beyond all
[28:44] fire this beyond all Zeal this beyond
[28:47] all uh um job is not worth it football's
[28:51] not worth it hunting's not worth it uh
[28:53] friendship's not worth it right I Think
[28:56] Jesus looked at him one day and said can
[28:57] you forsake your father your mother your
[28:59] sister and your brother see that's what
[29:01] he was telling Abram in so many words
[29:04] Abram walk before me and be thou
[29:10] perfect remember one thing when God ever
[29:12] says anything about you and calls your
[29:14] name he's going to see it through Amen
[29:17] brother R he's going to see it through
[29:19] whether you think you're going to make
[29:20] it through or not if he said Abraham
[29:22] walk before me and be thou perfect
[29:25] Abraham he had a purpose for that boy
[29:28] right he had a purpose for that man and
[29:32] you know what he knew he was going to
[29:33] make it
[29:36] amen
[29:38] now let's turn to chapter
[29:40] 17 and just kind of flip through real
[29:43] quick and for those of you that weren't
[29:45] here a couple Sundays ago uh Genesis
[29:48] 12-4 types justification chapters 15 and
[29:52] 16 type sanctification and now we're
[29:54] going to go 17- 19 we'll type in in your
[29:58] journey as a baptism of the Holy Ghost
[30:00] you said well I maybe I didn't um maybe
[30:03] I didn't walk exactly like this that's
[30:05] okay that's right I just read that it
[30:09] was an
[30:11] example an example for you to walk
[30:14] by some of you could have went through
[30:16] justification sanctification in two days
[30:18] one day hey the ones in the upper room
[30:21] how long did it take them right brother
[30:24] D how long did it take them in the upper
[30:25] room boom boom boom right one night or
[30:28] whatever day it was third hour of the
[30:31] day so it was early
[30:33] right they went through justification
[30:35] why they had the word planted in their
[30:37] heart amen Abram's problem was he didn't
[30:40] have the word pre-planted in his heart
[30:43] right Abram was learning like most of us
[30:45] should day by day by day by day right
[30:49] all right they they had been tutored by
[30:51] God himself the Lord Jesus tuted those
[30:53] disciples excuse me for three and 1/2
[30:55] years so they had all that word on
[30:58] already planted they had that fireball
[31:00] inside of them you know what though it
[31:02] was laying there
[31:05] dormant right right amen remember what
[31:09] somebody
[31:10] yesterday how many times have you ever
[31:12] took a field some of you Farmers or even
[31:14] some of us that plant food plots how you
[31:16] ever looked at the field and you take
[31:17] you spend $200 on
[31:19] Roundup you just kill the whole field
[31:22] right turn it under and leave it there
[31:25] till the spring yeah now where those
[31:27] seeds come
[31:29] from right where those seeds come from
[31:33] you didn't put them there all kind of
[31:35] weed seed why you stirred up the ground
[31:39] the seed was already laying there you
[31:41] just stirred up the environment that it
[31:43] was in right so it can get moisture and
[31:46] so it can get some a little bit of
[31:49] sunlight so the 120 in the upper room
[31:52] had been tutored by God
[31:55] himself that word was laying there
[31:57] dormant the word's not dormant right but
[32:00] it can lay inside of you dormant amen
[32:03] cuz you don't know how to use it that's
[32:04] right Abram didn't know how to use what
[32:06] God was given him glory Abram didn't
[32:10] know how to use it till he became
[32:12] Abraham right then when he met
[32:15] MDC he met MDC as a type of the new
[32:19] birth where God will meet
[32:21] you right right tell you
[32:25] Secrets he said can I withhold anything
[32:28] from my that's right servant
[32:30] Abraham anything from my servant
[32:33] Abraham same way with you and I Brother
[32:36] Martin and I were talking
[32:39] yesterday no today was today I guess it
[32:42] no it was yesterday or Monday evening
[32:44] Listen
[32:46] People you ought to be able to enter
[32:49] into every
[32:51] service right if you're a born un
[32:54] believer right amen you're you should be
[32:56] able you say well I don't know
[32:58] understand everything that's okay but
[32:59] just listen to what I'm trying to say
[33:01] right if
[33:05] Jesus if Jesus
[33:08] said
[33:11] Aaron before Abraham
[33:13] was I
[33:15] am where was
[33:17] he noic right look to Abram
[33:23] Abraham I Bal albone
[33:26] amen he met God face to
[33:29] face right what Jesus was telling those
[33:32] people Jesus was saying before Abraham
[33:35] was here your father was here I was
[33:39] already here amen the problem they
[33:42] couldn't I'm going to pinch you don't
[33:44] jump up the problem they couldn't get
[33:46] was this problem right here and I'm
[33:48] pinching F human flesh they couldn't get
[33:51] that part you be a man 50 years old you
[33:54] was before Abraham listen
[33:58] what was looking at Abraham that day
[34:01] when he changed his name from Abram to
[34:02] Abraham he sat down and fed God right
[34:07] Glory a calf
[34:09] amen now the eyeballs that that mzc were
[34:13] using fleshly was not the same eyeballs
[34:16] that Jesus had everybody okay with that
[34:18] that was not the Flesh of Jesus standing
[34:20] there in MDC but it was the person of
[34:23] Jesus Christ
[34:25] amen in the form of me H it right right
[34:29] in the theophany amen right and the
[34:32] theophany is no different than the flesh
[34:35] form right exactly right right amen no
[34:40] different same form right you're not
[34:43] going to look any different you did 20
[34:45] years when you were 20 years old when we
[34:47] when we go over there why because God
[34:49] took a picture of you remember at 20
[34:50] years old that's right and he said that
[34:52] is the form you're going to be
[34:54] in remember I told you about Jesus about
[34:57] God God is not some old man with a can
[35:01] that needs to be helped around right so
[35:04] and I saw I pulled up a line on MDC and
[35:07] it showed this old man with the beard
[35:08] you know standing there feeding um
[35:11] communion to to Abram on his journey I
[35:14] don't believe
[35:16] that you know Joshua met that same guy
[35:20] right and Joshua must have been afraid
[35:24] of him it wasn't no old man standing
[35:26] there Joshua got his sword and said are
[35:29] you for us or against us in other words
[35:30] he may look like a pretty good adversary
[35:32] amen
[35:34] right put a little MMA on them you know
[35:36] I mean kind of
[35:37] stout right but I mean really Danny if
[35:41] if you're a warrior and you meet
[35:42] somebody that's 90 years old and they're
[35:44] like this you're not going to pull a
[35:46] sword you're just going to go over there
[35:48] and say hey buddy what are you doing
[35:49] here you're old no this guy was young
[35:53] right when he met that captain of the
[35:54] host he met a young man Glory when
[35:57] Abraham met God he met a young man Glory
[36:01] when Mary Magdalene met that same man
[36:04] after he had resurrected right it was a
[36:06] young man she thought it was a gardener
[36:08] right but she heard a voice amen Abram
[36:11] heard that man's voice he' already met
[36:13] him one time right amen that's why God's
[36:16] got to meet
[36:18] you in justification Glory that way
[36:22] you'll know who he is right exactly when
[36:24] he gives you the new birth right
[36:26] remember I told you about the new spirit
[36:28] there was some questions in Bible study
[36:30] about that now remember the the new
[36:32] spirit you get in Ezekiel is not it it's
[36:35] a work of the Holy Spirit remember
[36:37] justification is a work of the Holy
[36:38] Spirit sanctification is a work of the
[36:40] same Holy Spirit but brother Bram said
[36:42] God gives you a you Spirit at
[36:44] sanctification so that you can what
[36:47] contact him amen he said the old Spirit
[36:49] you had you couldn't even contact
[36:51] yourself or even be able to to to to
[36:54] stand yourself so it's not a different
[36:56] Spirit but it's that same Holy Spirit
[36:58] softening up right that old nature you
[37:02] got amen right cuz you know what you're
[37:04] not going to keep that nature right it's
[37:06] going to die right right you're not
[37:08] going to divorce it you're not going to
[37:11] put it away right cuz you can't marry
[37:14] again amen you can't marry again if you
[37:17] got a living husband right right that
[37:20] old husband must be dead right now God
[37:22] don't kill your soul cuz that's your
[37:24] soul God kills the nature of that right
[37:27] the old nature that you have is what's
[37:28] going to die right so he gives you part
[37:31] of the Holy Spirit that's the only way I
[37:33] can say it the only way my maybe ddy can
[37:36] make it make it better but but when God
[37:39] gives you the new spirit in Ezekiel
[37:41] that's still his Spirit right cuz what
[37:43] he's doing is he's coming to you real
[37:45] slow amen he came to Abram slow didn't
[37:48] he that's right right took him a few few
[37:50] times meeting and you you knocks in the
[37:53] journey before he walks up and said
[37:55] Abraham you're going to have a son right
[37:58] right I'm going to visit you I personal
[38:03] pronoun I going to meet you right not
[38:05] I'm going to send another
[38:08] one I'm going to meet you amen did we
[38:11] read that in Genesis 17 I'm going to
[38:14] meet you according to the time of life
[38:16] right exactly and you're going to have a
[38:17] promised son Glory God's going to do the
[38:19] same to you and I because if he don't
[38:21] come remember it's the person of Jesus
[38:23] Christ that comes to you at the new
[38:24] birth same person same MDC
[38:28] same Holy Ghost exactly so now here's
[38:32] the
[38:34] bombshell if that's that big word if
[38:37] brother if the spirit of him that dwells
[38:39] in
[38:40] you is the same spirit that talk to ABR
[38:44] amen that's right exactly then what's
[38:47] wrong with our
[38:49] eyes not being able to see that's right
[38:53] what that man was talking to Abram about
[38:55] amen you say well those are flesh
[38:57] eyeballs that your mom and daddy gave
[39:00] you
[39:02] well God looked through a set of human
[39:05] eyes right right and then I think he
[39:08] said I'm going to go away or something
[39:10] like that didn't he say I'm going to go
[39:11] away amen but didn't he say he's going
[39:13] to come back and not be just with
[39:16] you that's right I don't think we got
[39:18] the end part right right that's right I
[39:21] think we're still looking at at the Old
[39:22] Testament anointing where God just
[39:24] anoints Abram and anoints Abraham and
[39:27] anoint David and then he
[39:29] leaves that's not that's not us folks
[39:32] that's right man so these same flesh
[39:35] eyes that I have tonight by the Holy
[39:39] Spirit ought to be able to see and
[39:41] understand amen what happened when that
[39:43] man
[39:44] MDC met ABR right cuz you know what you
[39:48] and I are going to have to
[39:50] produce that one that's right that
[39:52] talked to Abraham that's right now we
[39:55] know Abraham produced I
[39:59] right
[40:00] natural a natural baby but folks that
[40:04] wasn't the promise son right right it
[40:08] was according to the flesh right but it
[40:11] wasn't according to the spirit amen
[40:13] exactly mzc was trying to say Abram
[40:17] you're now going to be
[40:18] Abraham you're going to be able to I'm
[40:21] going to change your
[40:23] condition from a sinner to a saint right
[40:27] right that's what he's doing to you
[40:29] brother amen that's what he's doing to
[40:31] all of us that don't have anybody that
[40:33] doesn't have a new birth he's changing
[40:34] you from a sinner to a saint because
[40:36] I'll promise you one thing you can't do
[40:38] it yourself right don't ever try to
[40:41] think you can do it because according to
[40:42] the flesh you'll fail that's right right
[40:44] according to the flesh Abram fell
[40:46] according to the flesh hold on to your
[40:49] seat Abraham fa right sure remember he
[40:52] gave his wife away amen when he was
[40:55] Abraham right right exactly he had the
[40:58] promise in his hand he could sa the
[41:02] child right but yet he still wanted to
[41:04] save this old man right here right right
[41:09] but
[41:10] God told
[41:12] AMC God told him Abraham didn't go in
[41:15] and change nothing right right he didn't
[41:18] go in there and say oh I'm sorry I got
[41:20] I'm under conviction no no no aich God
[41:25] met aich that night in a vision right
[41:28] that's right he said if you touch that
[41:30] woman you're as good as a dead man right
[41:33] that's right why because God had already
[41:35] made a promise that that woman is where
[41:37] that natural seed was going to come from
[41:39] amen and if he touched her that whole
[41:41] line was gone right that whole line was
[41:44] dead but you know what Abraham was
[41:48] probably sitting back like this right
[41:50] here cuz he wasn't with her cuz you know
[41:52] what happens when a when the king wants
[41:54] to take a wife go back and study Esther
[41:57] yeah yeah they separate them right sure
[42:00] they put them in a place and they wash
[42:01] them they put real pretty spices on them
[42:04] and they put a real nice pretty gown on
[42:06] them and they separate them from
[42:08] everybody that's what they did Esther
[42:11] cuz when the king's ready to to have a
[42:13] woman presented in front of him she
[42:15] separated so I don't think that was
[42:16] Abraham and Sarah back and forth going
[42:18] on you I don't think Sarah was was was
[42:21] was huling for Abraham no she was quiet
[42:24] right and Abraham but you know what
[42:26] though God
[42:27] preserve that line he knew so much that
[42:31] when Abraham did get the
[42:34] Revelation see God don't mind if we
[42:36] don't get to Revelation first first go
[42:38] around or even the second go around or
[42:41] even the third go around yeah he doesn't
[42:44] mind fourth going around or fifth or
[42:48] right he really doesn't mind right but
[42:51] you know what he knows you're going to
[42:52] get it Glory you're the one that don't
[42:55] amen but what did Abraham do he kept
[42:59] walking when when AIT come and said
[43:04] Abraham sir why did you do
[43:08] that God spoke to me in a vision right
[43:11] that night and said said that that that
[43:13] was not your sister that was your
[43:16] wife and he said funny thing he said God
[43:20] told me you going to have to pray for me
[43:22] yeah and you're the one that goofed up
[43:24] right exactly a b didn't goof up huh he
[43:27] was just doing what he thought was right
[43:30] he saw a beautiful woman that already
[43:31] went through the change of the body not
[43:33] the change of life but went through the
[43:35] change of the body and she was
[43:38] beautiful right right so he was just
[43:40] doing whatever a king would do but God
[43:44] preserved what am I trying to say all
[43:46] the inadequacies and and the things that
[43:48] we do wrong God still if he gave you a
[43:51] promise right he's going to preserve you
[43:54] that's right Glory I got names right
[43:56] here
[43:58] you see this
[43:59] list I'm putting these names up
[44:03] downstairs and some of you have told me
[44:05] I want you to see this some of you have

[50:05] exactly and we're not going to make a
[50:07] shrine out of
[50:09] this but I want it to be a remembrance
[50:13] Glory because God in Corinthians
[50:16] gave those people's name Abram
[50:20] Abraham Jacob Isaac they're all given
[50:23] for
[50:24] examples for those of us that the end of
[50:27] the world's come to amen and that's us
[50:29] that's me and you brother Danny that's
[50:31] us so who's God depending on he's not
[50:35] dependent on Abraham anymore right he's
[50:38] dependent on the Seed of Abraham Glory
[50:41] which is what faith
[50:43] seed Abraham believed beyond
[50:48] belief
[50:50] Glory you say my
[50:53] kids Abram Abraham didn't even have
[50:56] anything to even look at exactly he
[50:59] didn't even have a physical Robbie
[51:01] mcferon to walk into the
[51:04] door and I got yours on
[51:06] there but he
[51:09] didn't but we've got physical
[51:11] people right we got Flesh and
[51:14] Blood I'm not trying to make you people
[51:16] feel good I want these people saved
[51:19] Glory I want these people full of the
[51:20] Holy Ghost amen I want these people like
[51:23] that can meet mezic not cuz Papa did
[51:26] right right I believe he met
[51:29] meaz but I got to meet
[51:32] meaz in my journey I got to meet him
[51:36] glory
[51:38] exactly come on people sure I wasn't
[51:42] going this way but I'm going this way
[51:43] now
[51:46] yeah but that same
[51:49] mezic is a high priest right right amen
[51:53] cuz everybody's got that confused about
[51:54] being the order of mezd it was God
[51:58] right it was the great healer the great
[52:02] Redeemer right the great all and all the
[52:05] Great I Am cuz Jesus even identified he
[52:08] said before Abraham was I am
[52:11] right right
[52:14] amen
[52:15] now look at Hebrews 11 and watch look
[52:19] what look what you don't have to go
[52:20] there
[52:21] now Abraham was looking for a city whose
[52:24] Builder and maker was God Amen
[52:27] amen Abraham didn't the only problem
[52:31] with
[52:32] Abraham Abraham didn't have the new
[52:34] birth or he would have been able to see
[52:37] that that
[52:39] city was right
[52:42] there you you realize
[52:45] that you realize that when he met me
[52:47] when Abraham met mezc there was the city
[52:51] but there was no way that City could get
[52:52] inside of Abraham because it was
[52:55] promised for his children
[52:58] exactly right
[53:00] sure and is that promised to you sure oh
[53:04] you believe that oh yeah I know you
[53:08] do but we got to start believing it for
[53:11] the Bible said our children's children
[53:14] amen right our
[53:17] generation
[53:20] right I'm not any better than any one of
[53:23] you so why God pick me yeah CU I said
[53:31] yes a't that
[53:33] simple Abram said yes right ABR said
[53:36] okay I I'll just do what this voice is
[53:39] telling me to do but remember he learned
[53:43] that voice right and that same voice
[53:46] that was so consistent he finally one
[53:49] day when he walked up to him in a
[53:51] tent and he said
[53:54] Abraham you're going to have a child
[53:56] amen and buddy that brought all of his
[54:00] journey down to one place glory and that
[54:03] was under that oak
[54:06] tree he met the city he was looking for
[54:09] but see remember Abraham didn't have he
[54:12] had flesh
[54:13] eyes he had spiritual eyes enough to
[54:16] realize that that was somebody different
[54:18] but he didn't have enough spiritual eyes
[54:20] to realize that was the city he was
[54:22] looking for yeah but what did God tell
[54:25] him he said you are going to be a father
[54:27] of many
[54:29] nations glory and said in Galatians 3:16
[54:32] not his seed as of many he told ABR he
[54:34] said look down at the ground look up at
[54:36] the stars that was his natural seed but
[54:39] God was telling him in a
[54:43] type that the faith seat of Abraham is
[54:46] where all this is going to come from
[54:48] Glory all right let's turn to
[54:53] galatian you love the
[54:55] Lord and you got to love me
[54:59] then I told him about in Oklahoma
[55:01] somebody said we were talking about
[55:02] something and I said well you may not
[55:03] love me but the Lord
[55:05] done cuz you know
[55:09] what Abram was just a regular kind of
[55:13] guy right he didn't
[55:16] uh he wasn't very
[55:20] talented but God blessed him glory now
[55:23] listen
[55:26] Romans chapter 4 we're not going to get
[55:28] you should know that when Abraham met
[55:30] mezd Romans CH 4:1 when when U Abraham
[55:35] met mecdc that was the type of the
[55:37] baptism of the Holy Spirit right it
[55:38] comes in and then Abraham circumcises
[55:40] himself and his whole household and that
[55:44] type's there and then you look and you
[55:45] see that the type of
[55:48] Isaac being the promis son and he said
[55:52] take thy son thy only
[55:54] son because remember
[55:57] for those of you that maybe have not
[55:58] heard this
[55:59] before God doesn't finish with you at
[56:02] the new birth that's right he just
[56:04] begins to use you amen he just begins to
[56:08] use you at the new Earth so then you go
[56:11] through justification all over again
[56:13] right just a higher form you go through
[56:15] sanctification a higher form you go
[56:18] through the new birth a higher form you
[56:20] say another not another New Birth why do
[56:22] you think this holy spirit's right here
[56:24] for though right justification
[56:26] sanctification baptism of Holy Ghost
[56:28] gets you in the body right amen then God
[56:31] starts building these virtues In You by
[56:34] Justified Sanctified you realizing what
[56:38] God's
[56:38] done then brother Brown said the Holy
[56:41] Spirit does what SEALs in these virtues
[56:44] not that you're sealed in the Kingdom
[56:46] again there's only one your birth that
[56:48] seals you in the kingdom of God but this
[56:51] in the end time this is what's required
[56:54] of us right brother Richard Robert this
[56:56] this is what's required amen he never
[56:58] heard that that was requirement
[57:02] right we laugh but most of you didn't
[57:06] either it's a requirement that these
[57:08] virtues be formed in us they don't just
[57:11] write the Bible just to put in verses
[57:13] just to fill Up's space right all right
[57:16] so justification sanctification baptism
[57:18] Holy Ghost seals this in then we got to
[57:21] walk about talk about this guy amen you
[57:23] know I told you the other day and I
[57:24] forgot to bring it I found a quote with
[57:25] brother Brown your flesh has got to be
[57:27] born again amen your flesh has got to be
[57:32] born again right exactly yeah cuz the
[57:34] first one wasn't right right that's what
[57:37] we're going to talk about right here now
[57:38] watch this is Paul after he reads the
[57:41] Old Testament and he gets the revelation
[57:45] of what's going on all right Ro in
[57:47] Romans chapter
[57:48] 1 I told him if they wanted to put it up
[57:51] they could but I want you to read it in
[57:52] your own
[57:54] Bible cuz you know what
[57:58] you mark it up you won't forget
[58:01] it what shall we say then that Abraham
[58:04] our father as pertaining to the flesh ha
[58:07] found question
[58:09] mark for If Abraham were justified by
[58:14] works he hath whereof the glory but not
[58:17] before God in other words if God would
[58:19] have just give him everything right at
[58:21] the at
[58:24] justification what's the journey amen
[58:27] what's the journey right see if if for
[58:31] If Abraham look you can read it up here
[58:33] if Abraham were justified by works he
[58:36] hath where of the glory hey look at me
[58:39] yeah I did
[58:42] it that's where you go wrong right
[58:48] right the only ey I worried about is the
[58:50] eye when he said I'm going to visit you
[58:53] amen right I'm going to visit you the
[58:55] eye I am the personal pronoun the one
[58:59] that can do it because we can't for what
[59:02] sayith the scripture Abraham believed
[59:03] God and it was counted or imputed unto
[59:06] him for righteousness not to him that
[59:09] worketh is the reward not reckoned of
[59:11] Grace but of debt like they said
[59:13] something we owe that was owed to us no
[59:16] but to him that worketh not but
[59:18] believeth on him that
[59:22] justify right you see that th right
[59:25] that's an ongoing right
[59:30] justify the ungodly there's
[59:34] me did he not you oh he justified The
[59:38] Godly no he justifies the
[59:40] ungodly right his faith is counted for
[59:42] righteousness even as David also
[59:44] describeth the blessedness of man unto
[59:47] whom God imputeth righteousness without
[59:49] works in other words what David's been
[59:50] preaching on where David said blessed is
[59:53] the man who God will not impute or
[59:55] reckon right sin all right now listen if
[59:58] you're truly if you truly been Justified
[1:00:01] today your sins are gone amen right
[1:00:05] exactly right amen right you're
[1:00:09] just lot was
[1:00:13] just the Bible said it vexed lot's
[1:00:18] righteous
[1:00:19] soul to be where he was at right amen
[1:00:23] the problem with lot was though lot
[1:00:25] didn't continue on with God right lot
[1:00:29] plopped down in Sodom and said this is
[1:00:31] it Abraham was continually looking for
[1:00:34] that City Glory all right well you know
[1:00:37] why that's why Abram got the promise and
[1:00:39] Abraham that's why they got the promise
[1:00:41] right blessed is the man to whom the
[1:00:43] Lord will not accute sin cometh this
[1:00:44] blessedness then upon the circumcision
[1:00:46] only he's asking a question or upon the
[1:00:50] uncircumcision also but we say that
[1:00:52] Faith was reckoned to Abraham for
[1:00:54] righteousness right how was it then
[1:00:56] reckoned when he was in circumcision or
[1:00:58] in uncircumcision not in circumcision
[1:01:01] but uncircumcision did everybody
[1:01:02] understand that Sunday let me break that
[1:01:04] down for you just a
[1:01:05] second in other words Abraham Abram was
[1:01:09] walking through justification and
[1:01:11] sanctification
[1:01:13] uncircumcised
[1:01:15] exactly let's talk natural all right
[1:01:18] click on for a minute we're talking
[1:01:20] about
[1:01:20] flesh he was not circumcised and you and
[1:01:24] I same way right
[1:01:28] spiritually justification sanctification
[1:01:30] are works of the Holy Spirit not in you
[1:01:33] and not cutting off the excess worldly
[1:01:37] part of the flesh all right so Abraham
[1:01:40] was look he reckoned Abraham righteous
[1:01:43] when Abram got up and started walking
[1:01:48] man you saw oh no way over there he had
[1:01:50] to meat
[1:01:52] milk I know that go knows that but you
[1:01:57] don't know that right so just keep
[1:02:00] walking and somewhere he's going to meet
[1:02:02] you amen he promised How It Was Then
[1:02:05] reckoned when he was in circumcision or
[1:02:07] in uncircumcision not circumcision now
[1:02:10] what's he what question is he answering
[1:02:12] Faith was reckoned to Abraham for
[1:02:14] righteousness verse n how was it
[1:02:17] reckoned after he had met mezc and after
[1:02:19] he' been circumcised and after he no it
[1:02:23] says not in circumcision but in uncircum
[1:02:27] all right and he received the sign of
[1:02:29] circumcision was a
[1:02:33] seal tell what's righteous amen of the
[1:02:37] righteousness of the faith which he
[1:02:44] had exactly when he got up and started
[1:02:46] walking sister B he had Faith amen
[1:02:51] already wasn't a god started walking
[1:02:53] right you say is't that too simple
[1:02:56] yeah brother Chris is probably
[1:02:57] scratching his head wondering why is he
[1:02:59] here and what is he doing he just got up
[1:03:02] and start
[1:03:03] walking yeah got a lot of
[1:03:05] questions but you got up and started
[1:03:08] walking amen you got to where the
[1:03:10] fountain was right and he received the
[1:03:14] sign of circumcision the Seal of the
[1:03:16] righteousness of the faith which he had
[1:03:19] yet being
[1:03:20] uncircumcised right that he might be the
[1:03:23] father of all of them that believe
[1:03:26] right what's he saying Abram believed
[1:03:29] from the
[1:03:31] beginning now he didn't know he's going
[1:03:33] to have a son and all that but but he
[1:03:35] promised him he said you going to be the
[1:03:37] father of many nations right now listen
[1:03:40] people then it's God's responsibility if
[1:03:43] Abram put himself in that
[1:03:46] place then it's God's responsibility to
[1:03:49] fulfill exactly not mine or yours and
[1:03:52] the father of circumcision to them who
[1:03:54] are not of the circumcision only
[1:03:57] oh I'm sorry I missed it and he verse 11
[1:03:59] and he received the sign of circumcision
[1:04:01] a seal of the righteousness of the face
[1:04:04] which he had yet being uncircumcised
[1:04:06] that he might be the father of all them
[1:04:07] that believe though they be not
[1:04:10] circumcised right that righteousness
[1:04:12] might be imputed unto them or reckoned
[1:04:17] right so God
[1:04:19] knows that you're going to make it so he
[1:04:23] imputes it that's why those who he has
[1:04:26] Justified he is
[1:04:29] already amen glorified exactly doesn't
[1:04:32] that put the scripture together those
[1:04:35] who he's Justified you say baby form
[1:04:37] justification if it's true justification
[1:04:40] absolutely cuz you can't be reckoned
[1:04:44] Abraham could not be reckoned with
[1:04:46] unbelief right or he' have never had the
[1:04:48] child
[1:04:49] exactly and the father of circumcision
[1:04:52] to them who are not of the circumcision
[1:04:53] only but who also walk in the steps of
[1:04:57] that Faith of Our Father
[1:04:59] Abraham huh right if you're not born
[1:05:02] again tonight walk in the steps of your
[1:05:07] father Abraham amen hallelujah and you
[1:05:10] can put dick Addison you put that that's
[1:05:12] why God puts you around people right
[1:05:15] sure does that's why God puts you around
[1:05:18] people okay to do what to see God right
[1:05:23] to see how to act or not
[1:05:27] and the father of circumcision to them
[1:05:29] who are not of the circumcision only
[1:05:30] also walk in the steps of that
[1:05:33] Faith of Our Father Abraham which he had
[1:05:37] yet which he had yet being uncircumcised
[1:05:41] you see that which he had yet being
[1:05:43] uncircumcised we always think well oh
[1:05:46] Abraham got the promise cuz he become
[1:05:48] Abraham and he be this right here Paul
[1:05:51] is picking it up telling you that even
[1:05:54] before Abra abam became Abraham right he
[1:05:59] had Faith
[1:06:01] amen exactly that's the only reason he
[1:06:04] got the promise Glory was that he had
[1:06:07] Faith at the
[1:06:08] beginning for the promise that he should
[1:06:11] be the heir of the world was not to
[1:06:13] Abraham or to his seed through the
[1:06:17] law because the law is not of Faith
[1:06:22] right but through the righteousness of
[1:06:25] faith
[1:06:26] for if they which are of the law be
[1:06:28] heirs faith is made void all you got to
[1:06:31] do is do the Ten Commandments 1 2 3 4
[1:06:34] 9:10 and you go to heaven oh yeah
[1:06:37] wrong Rich Young Ruler did it remember
[1:06:40] he said I've kept the law since my
[1:06:44] youth but he didn't have enough
[1:06:48] Faith come on people right Jesus knew
[1:06:52] one thing he could not get rid of and
[1:06:54] that was his money
[1:06:57] yeah in other words the Rich Young Ruler
[1:06:59] did not have enough Faith to say I
[1:07:02] believe what you're telling me right so
[1:07:05] I'm going to lay all this down and
[1:07:06] become one of your disciples he didn't
[1:07:09] have the faith to believe
[1:07:11] that covered the law because the law
[1:07:14] worketh what wrath right but where no
[1:07:18] law is there's no transgression right if
[1:07:22] you don't do it you don't do it that's
[1:07:23] right
[1:07:24] exactly therefore it is of faith that it
[1:07:28] might be by grace to the end the promise
[1:07:32] might be sure to all the seed Not seeds
[1:07:37] right we'll get to that in a minute in
[1:07:39] Galatians not to that only which is of
[1:07:41] the law but to that also which is of the
[1:07:44] faith of Abraham who is the father of us
[1:07:46] all now look in parentheses as it is
[1:07:49] written I have made thee a father of
[1:07:51] many Nation right before him whom he
[1:07:54] believed even God who quickeneth the
[1:07:56] dead and calleth those things what which
[1:07:58] be not as though they were who against
[1:08:02] hope
[1:08:05] Dy believed in Hope
[1:08:08] right but his hope became Faith right
[1:08:12] exactly that's right hope is not good if
[1:08:14] it stays hope right that's right but
[1:08:16] when hope becomes
[1:08:18] Faith it's solid right I hope I'm going
[1:08:21] to heaven I hope I'm going to heaven
[1:08:23] that don't sound good does it but when
[1:08:25] you know that you know that you know
[1:08:27] that's right it opens up a lot of doors
[1:08:30] right cuz you know what that's
[1:08:32] Faith who against hope believed in hope
[1:08:35] that he might become the father of many
[1:08:37] nations according watch this right
[1:08:39] here to that which
[1:08:43] was spoken right not what Abram thought
[1:08:48] not even what Abraham said Abraham never
[1:08:50] come out and put his hands in his
[1:08:52] suspenders and said I'm going to be a
[1:08:54] father of many nations
[1:08:56] he didn't have a clue how he was going
[1:08:57] to be a father of many Nation did
[1:09:01] he he even tried to figure it out one
[1:09:04] time and got in trouble yeah with his
[1:09:06] handmade with his bond
[1:09:08] woman see that's why the Bond
[1:09:12] woman this
[1:09:14] guy is going to always keep you bound
[1:09:17] right but the son of the free woman is
[1:09:19] the promise amen which is by what f a i
[1:09:23] right amen where was I 19 and being not
[1:09:28] weak in faith he consider not his own
[1:09:30] body no I'm sorry according to that
[1:09:33] which was spoken so shall thy seed be
[1:09:35] now who Adam I mean Abraham didn't speak
[1:09:38] that who spoke that God told Abraham
[1:09:40] that right God told you
[1:09:43] amen thank you sister Jim God told
[1:09:47] you God spoke to
[1:09:49] you you ought all said amen right amen
[1:09:53] y'all are still looking at Abraham y'all
[1:09:55] are looking back 4,000 years of what God
[1:09:57] did to some man you don't even
[1:09:59] know
[1:10:01] tonight Glory right
[1:10:04] tonight so shall thy seed be right and
[1:10:08] being not weak in faith he considered
[1:10:10] not his own body now dead now here Paul
[1:10:12] is picking up natural cuz his body was
[1:10:16] dead come on folks he was 100 years old
[1:10:19] right he
[1:10:22] knew whether nobody else knew it or not
[1:10:25] he knew he was dead
[1:10:28] right and his lovely wife Sarah he knew
[1:10:31] she was dead and gone
[1:10:33] too cuz she was right at his age right
[1:10:36] yeah when he was about 100 years old
[1:10:38] neither yet the deadness of Sarah's wom
[1:10:40] now what's he doing being not weak in
[1:10:42] faith right he considered not in other
[1:10:45] words that didn't enter into Abraham's
[1:10:48] equation
[1:10:49] right he staggered not at the promise of
[1:10:52] God through unbelief now wait a minute
[1:10:56] okay wait a minute sister Teresa didn't
[1:10:59] God didn't Abraham get on his face and
[1:11:02] laugh at God me produce a
[1:11:06] son remember Sarah got in trouble for
[1:11:09] just laughing her heart Abraham got down
[1:11:13] on the ground yeah and laughed
[1:11:17] exactly but Paul what do you say about
[1:11:20] it he staggered
[1:11:23] not hm what was what was Paul looking
[1:11:27] at I think Paul was looking at the end
[1:11:29] result right right he staggered not at
[1:11:32] the promise of God through unbelief but
[1:11:34] was strong in faith giving glory amen to
[1:11:40] God cuz you know what
[1:11:44] people there's nothing you done
[1:11:49] right to God be the glory cuz it ain't
[1:11:52] none of yours and it ain't none of mine
[1:11:55] that's right and being fully
[1:11:57] persuaded in other words he convinced
[1:12:01] himself that God was
[1:12:03] right fully
[1:12:06] persuaded now what is
[1:12:10] persuasion he had to lean to his
[1:12:14] own carnal I can't do it in the flesh
[1:12:19] yeah but he was fully persuaded what God
[1:12:22] you said I was going to have it right
[1:12:24] now God didn't beg and plead with him
[1:12:28] right cuz see that's the difference in
[1:12:30] Abraham and
[1:12:31] lot Abraham just believed it lot was
[1:12:35] like well maybe I'll just take this part
[1:12:36] of the land over here and you know you
[1:12:38] you can have all this over here and I'll
[1:12:40] go down here toward Sodom cuz it looks
[1:12:41] like a better place you see what I'm
[1:12:43] saying you watch look Read that read
[1:12:46] that about Abram and Abraham read how
[1:12:48] focused he was really you say well he
[1:12:51] was no he was moving he was looking for
[1:12:53] something cuz we're going to read it in
[1:12:54] just minute if we have time that he was
[1:12:56] looking for a city yeah now that was
[1:12:59] never written in the Old Testament
[1:13:02] right right it never was written pinned
[1:13:05] in the Old Testament Abraham was looking
[1:13:07] for a city now why do we get in Hebrews
[1:13:10] 11 and see the father of our faith
[1:13:12] looking for a city right being fully
[1:13:15] persuaded that what he had promised who
[1:13:19] that's not that he is not Abraham right
[1:13:22] that's right and that he is not able to
[1:13:24] perform that's not Abraham right that's
[1:13:26] God glory and therefore it was what
[1:13:30] reckoned to him for righteousness right
[1:13:33] now it was not written for his sake
[1:13:35] alone thank
[1:13:40] God that it was imputed to him right but
[1:13:44] for who us one more time for who us us
[1:13:49] also to whom it shall be what imputed
[1:13:53] here we go we say all this Abraham this
[1:13:55] great person there was this great person
[1:13:57] Paul's making it very personal here for
[1:14:00] us also to whom it shall be imputed what
[1:14:03] righteousness right if brother dick
[1:14:06] there's your big word if right we
[1:14:09] believe on him that raised up Jesus our
[1:14:11] lord from the dead who was delivered for
[1:14:13] our offences and was raised again for
[1:14:15] what raised again
[1:14:19] right again
[1:14:24] yeah you reckon that may be talking
[1:14:25] about us right Glory cuz he was raised
[1:14:28] one time right 2,000 years
[1:14:31] ago that says again amen for our thank
[1:14:37] you sister Anna she said for our for our
[1:14:40] justification right what to whom the

[1:16:46] yeah watch how God does God puts people
[1:16:50] in place you know why I put them names

[1:17:25] works we didn't hardly have nobody
[1:17:28] qualified for a deacon you had brother
[1:17:29] collie that was here and brother Dy some
[1:17:31] of the others now we got a church full
[1:17:35] amen
[1:17:36] why cuz you somebody believed the
[1:17:39] promise
[1:17:40] amen right that's right so the Next
[1:17:44] Generation if we have another 10 or 15
[1:17:46] years those people's names that I called
[1:17:48] a lot of them are in their teens and
[1:17:50] their 20s we're going to need them to do
[1:17:52] things that maybe some of us old people
[1:17:54] forget to do
[1:17:58] exactly and that's the truth people
[1:18:00] right nevertheless what sayith the
[1:18:03] scripture cast out the Bond woman and
[1:18:05] her son for the son of the Bond woman
[1:18:07] shall not be a with the son of the free
[1:18:09] woman so then brethren we are not
[1:18:11] children of bond of the Bond woman but
[1:18:14] of the free now just for a second the
[1:18:18] Bond woman produced a son but now when
[1:18:21] it comes to the promise when it comes to
[1:18:24] God telling Abraham to take his son his
[1:18:27] only son
[1:18:31] right now folks naturally he had more
[1:18:34] than one son
[1:18:39] right B
[1:18:41] woman right right here this is binding
[1:18:45] us right now Glory
[1:18:48] exactly but if you stay on that God's
[1:18:52] going to bless you cuz you blessed ishma
[1:18:55] he blessed Hagar remember Hagar went out
[1:18:56] under the tree and and S must just read
[1:18:59] it but she sits down and and Abraham
[1:19:03] gives her some water and gives her some
[1:19:05] bread and she's out right
[1:19:08] God God the Bible said God comes to that
[1:19:12] woman and hears her cry that's right
[1:19:14] exactly and takes care of that woman
[1:19:17] right opens up a well
[1:19:19] for see you're going to be blessed even
[1:19:21] the bond woman's blessed but that wasn't
[1:19:24] the prom
[1:19:26] son folks we want the promised son right
[1:19:30] we don't want to be bound I don't even
[1:19:31] like that word
[1:19:33] bond bound I like free amen shall not be
[1:19:38] a remember when he got to one place when
[1:19:40] he got to one place what did God have to
[1:19:42] do though Abraham said
[1:19:47] Hagar you take ish and you leave
[1:19:51] right because Isaac was the promised son
[1:19:54] he didn't want those two mixing and
[1:19:55] mingling
[1:19:58] right right
[1:20:00] exactly this is going to be a wild child
[1:20:02] as long as we let it be one right but
[1:20:05] that free woman is inside
[1:20:07] here the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:20:10] what's supposed to set us free right
[1:20:11] right so will not be air cast out the
[1:20:15] Bond woman and her son for the son of
[1:20:16] the Bond woman shall not be air with the
[1:20:17] son of the free woman so then brethren
[1:20:19] we are not children of the Bor woman but
[1:20:21] of the free now let's go to Galatians 3
[1:20:23] back up when it we be finish right
[1:20:28] there I like somebody you know when when
[1:20:31] when brother Dale or any of you Brothers
[1:20:33] brother de used to do a lot and brother
[1:20:35] colie used to do a lot he would just
[1:20:37] take scripture and just go right down
[1:20:38] through and explain you know
[1:20:40] what I forget a
[1:20:43] lot but God let me be able to write
[1:20:46] these things down in my Bible right so
[1:20:49] that I can uh remember now look go to
[1:20:52] Galatians 3
[1:20:55] verse
[1:20:56] 6 let's go to go to verse six just just
[1:20:59] scroll up to verse six Brother
[1:21:01] Anderson 1-5 is okay but look this is
[1:21:05] this is where he's getting to Abraham
[1:21:08] even as Abraham believed God it was a
[1:21:10] counted to him for righteousness know ye
[1:21:12] therefore that they which are of Faith
[1:21:15] the same are the children of Abraham
[1:21:18] exactly and the scripture look
[1:21:23] foreseeing for
[1:21:25] knowing for
[1:21:30] knowledge that God would
[1:21:33] justify
[1:21:36] Richard
[1:21:38] Roberts and
[1:21:40] Richard htis he's not here but that's
[1:21:44] okay and I can't remember Richard
[1:21:46] Marlo's last name and Richard
[1:21:50] Marlo that word heathen I told you many
[1:21:53] times when I first came back to Lord
[1:21:55] sister Teresa I the Lord showed me one
[1:21:57] thing Abraham's not going to do me any
[1:22:00] good right unless I walk the steps of
[1:22:03] Abraham but as long as I leave Abraham
[1:22:05] in there that really is not going to do
[1:22:07] me any good but if I put way Dale's name
[1:22:09] in there right and I know folks I was a
[1:22:13] heathen so were
[1:22:15] you right so and the
[1:22:19] scripture
[1:22:20] foreseeing that God would justify
[1:22:24] the Heathen right through what faith
[1:22:29] right preached before the
[1:22:34] gospel preached
[1:22:36] preached that's the first time that's
[1:22:38] ever been brought
[1:22:39] up God talked to Abraham God talked to
[1:22:42] ABR no God preached to Abraham right God
[1:22:44] preached to Abram preached before the
[1:22:47] gospel un Abraham saying in the shall
[1:22:50] All Nations be blessed right so then
[1:22:53] they which be of Faith are
[1:22:57] blessed with faithful Abraham for as
[1:23:01] many as are the works of the law are
[1:23:03] under the curse now what a minute whoa
[1:23:04] verse 10 hold on a second here what does
[1:23:06] that say for as many as are of the works
[1:23:11] of the law are under the
[1:23:15] curse what is the curse
[1:23:18] death the law is death right righten for
[1:23:23] as many as under the works and I wrote
[1:23:25] in my Bible of the law or under and I
[1:23:27] underline the curse and I wrote Death
[1:23:29] for it is written cursed is everyone
[1:23:32] that
[1:23:33] continueth see that th can be mean bad
[1:23:36] things too yeah that continueth
[1:23:40] not in all things what which are written
[1:23:43] in the book of the law to do them
[1:23:47] right but that no man is justified by
[1:23:50] the law in the sight of God is evident
[1:23:52] right for the just shall live by faith
[1:23:55] Amen in other words what that's what
[1:23:59] that's what Luther
[1:24:01] saw that the keeping of the law or the
[1:24:04] keeping of the Roman Catholic
[1:24:08] law was not going to justify he just
[1:24:10] going to condemn you cuz Luther tried to
[1:24:14] do Penance he tried to do the things the
[1:24:15] Catholic Church said but one day God
[1:24:18] said
[1:24:20] hey read verse 11 yeah the just shall
[1:24:24] not live by works right the just shall
[1:24:28] live by faith Glory not by works L any
[1:24:31] man should boast the law is not a
[1:24:36] faith but the man that doeth them shall
[1:24:39] live in them amen in other words you
[1:24:42] were doing okay to do the
[1:24:44] law but was it
[1:24:47] faith it was just doing what somebody
[1:24:49] wrote down on a piece of paper right but
[1:24:51] look verse 13 Christ hath redeemed us
[1:24:54] from the death of the law
[1:24:58] right being made death for us I'm not
[1:25:01] changing the scripture all right I'm not
[1:25:03] adding to or taking from right anybody
[1:25:05] understand where I'm getting that from
[1:25:06] amen curse is the death death is a curse
[1:25:09] right right if you don't know that just
[1:25:12] keep getting older you'll
[1:25:14] understand for it is written cursed is
[1:25:17] everyone that hangeth on a tree which we
[1:25:19] know Jesus was that the blessings of
[1:25:21] Abraham what the J live by faith right
[1:25:25] that was the blessings of
[1:25:30] Abraham he saith
[1:25:32] not no wait a minute that the blessings
[1:25:34] of Abraham might come on the Gentiles
[1:25:36] through Jesus Christ that we might
[1:25:38] receive the
[1:25:40] promise of the spirit through faith
[1:25:44] right in other words what to meet
[1:25:48] MDC and bring forth the promise right
[1:25:52] that's what we're supposed to do amen
[1:25:53] bring forth the the promised son it
[1:25:56] wasn't it just Abraham brought Isaac I
[1:25:57] hope you're I hope you're trying to
[1:25:59] brother Bron preached taking God out of
[1:26:01] History amen take all these people out
[1:26:04] of History right exactly get them out of
[1:26:07] History right I thought the B said these
[1:26:10] were given for examples Amen to whom the
[1:26:12] ends of the world will come upon which
[1:26:14] is you and I Glory Brethren I speak
[1:26:17] after the manner of
[1:26:18] men though it be but a man's Covenant
[1:26:21] yet if it be confirmed
[1:26:24] now how did God confirm the Covenant
[1:26:26] with Abraham circumcision amen yet if it
[1:26:28] be confirmed no man diseth or adth theto
[1:26:34] right now to Abraham and his seed were
[1:26:36] the promises made he saith not and to
[1:26:40] seeds as of
[1:26:42] many
[1:26:45] stop not natural right not the same you
[1:26:49] know he told Abraham he said look down
[1:26:51] and see the sand look up and see the
[1:26:52] stars
[1:26:55] he didn't say as two seeds as of many
[1:26:57] right but as of one
[1:27:00] Glory Genesis
[1:27:02] 1 26 and 27 amen that's the man that he
[1:27:07] talking about that God want him keep sin
[1:27:10] to cuz God can impute sin to me and you
[1:27:14] but he can't he cannot impute sin to
[1:27:18] himself
[1:27:20] right and to Abraham and his seed were
[1:27:23] the promises made he said Not seeds as
[1:27:24] of many but as of one and to thy
[1:27:29] seed which is Christ and this I say that
[1:27:32] the Covenant that was confirmed before
[1:27:36] before of God in Christ the law which
[1:27:38] was 430 years after what after Abraham
[1:27:43] remember he promised him that his seed
[1:27:45] was soj for 400 years and they went
[1:27:47] ahead in 430 years God gave him Grace
[1:27:50] down in in Egypt remember and then Moses
[1:27:52] come along I'm just trying to catch sh
[1:27:54] up with that right the Covenant that was
[1:27:56] conf confirmed before of God in Christ
[1:27:59] the law which was 430 years after in
[1:28:01] other
[1:28:03] words boy you going to hate
[1:28:06] this that promise that God made to
[1:28:09] Abraham doesn't matter what the law said
[1:28:11] on a piece of paper right you're not
[1:28:14] going to disan the promise that God made
[1:28:17] to Abraham exactly amen the law didn't
[1:28:19] come to change the promise exactly
[1:28:22] that's right right am that's what he's
[1:28:25] saying right here the law which was 430
[1:28:28] years after God met Abraham and said
[1:28:30] you're going to have this promised seed
[1:28:33] cannot
[1:28:35] disan that it should make the promise of
[1:28:37] none effect exactly people thought well
[1:28:40] now we're going to start doing the law
[1:28:42] but see watch what they did when Jesus
[1:28:44] came when they met MDC
[1:28:47] again they were the this is my point
[1:28:49] they were the natural Seed of Abraham
[1:28:51] amen
[1:28:54] right you keep them creases between your
[1:28:56] eyes and you going to get little
[1:28:58] old brother Mark talks to you and
[1:29:01] he but really that's what they were the
[1:29:04] Pharisees and Sadducees that was looking
[1:29:06] at MDC
[1:29:07] again they said we be of the Seed of
[1:29:11] Abraham amen now I'm telling you people
[1:29:14] don't let that happen in the end time
[1:29:16] yeah cuz it
[1:29:18] will they looked at MDC again but they
[1:29:22] were not of the faith seed of Abra
[1:29:24] right they were of the natural exactly
[1:29:27] can't deny that they show you their
[1:29:30] lineage all the way back natural but
[1:29:33] they were not of the spiritual Beed
[1:29:35] because Jesus told them said you of your
[1:29:37] father not of Abraham but of the devil
[1:29:41] for if the inheritance be of the law see
[1:29:45] that's what the Pharisees and sagues
[1:29:46] they thought they were going to get the
[1:29:47] inheritance and would have and did
[1:29:50] before Jesus came but when Jesus came it
[1:29:53] didn't anull
[1:29:55] it he just actually brought that promise
[1:29:59] In the Flesh amen the one that should
[1:30:01] have come not Isaac right but Jesus
[1:30:03] Christ for if the inheritance be of the
[1:30:05] law it's no more promise
[1:30:09] right dos and don'ts cut your hair don't
[1:30:12] cut your hair wear pants don't wear
[1:30:14] pants come to church don't come to
[1:30:17] church if it be just by
[1:30:20] that then it's not the promise anymore
[1:30:22] right exactly but God gave it to Abraham
[1:30:26] by
[1:30:27] promise wherefore then serveth the law
[1:30:30] question
[1:30:31] mark it was added because of the
[1:30:34] transgressions of men let me add that in
[1:30:37] there just to make you realize that's
[1:30:39] what he did he added that transgression
[1:30:41] because of our sins
[1:30:45] right till what
[1:30:48] amen till the 120 in the upper
[1:30:52] room came came to who the promise was
[1:30:54] made amen some of you smileing I'm not
[1:30:58] changing the word but that's what that's
[1:30:59] where the promise began that's where the
[1:31:01] real promise began right wherefore then
[1:31:04] serveth the law it was added because of
[1:31:06] our transgression till the seed should
[1:31:09] come to whom the promise was made and it
[1:31:12] was ordained by
[1:31:15] Angels now Angels can't give you the
[1:31:17] promise but it was ordained by little
[1:31:20] angels right
[1:31:24] ministers
[1:31:27] right in the hands of a
[1:31:30] mediator now mediator is not the
[1:31:32] mediator of one not a pope Pope's not
[1:31:36] the mediator between God and man we know
[1:31:39] who that was now the mediator is not a
[1:31:41] mediator of one but God is one is the
[1:31:44] law then against the promise of God God
[1:31:48] forbid if you don't do the things you're
[1:31:51] supposed to
[1:31:52] do you don't have the promise
[1:31:55] right but if you do do the things you're
[1:31:57] supposed to do you have the promise and
[1:32:01] you have your Justified
[1:32:05] watch is the law then against the
[1:32:07] promise of God God
[1:32:09] forbid other words like d said God
[1:32:11] forbid man that you think that this law
[1:32:13] was just for nothing right it's all this
[1:32:15] Old Testament exactly but that's what
[1:32:17] they
[1:32:18] had as an example or foundation for you
[1:32:22] and I
[1:32:24] cuz let me just be real honest when
[1:32:26] milasan met Abraham sure he was talking
[1:32:30] to him in a twofold manner one you're
[1:32:31] going to have a natural son you going to
[1:32:33] have but all these seeds are going to be
[1:32:35] yours but he was not speaking of seeds
[1:32:37] as of many right Paul picked that
[1:32:40] up MDC was talking about you and I
[1:32:44] exactly cuz he had us on his mind amen
[1:32:48] you Lord we were there with him glory
[1:32:50] you said oh brother Brown said we were
[1:32:51] there in the shores of Galilee
[1:32:53] absolutely but you know what we were
[1:32:54] there talking to Abraham too right
[1:32:57] sister Gil you were there not you the
[1:32:59] person I'm looking at but if you have
[1:33:01] the Holy Spirit that same Holy Ghost
[1:33:03] right that's in you
[1:33:05] tonight had to be or it's a different
[1:33:07] person right
[1:33:09] right then this whole thing's a
[1:33:12] lie come on people this whole thing is a
[1:33:14] lie if the Holy Ghost you have in you
[1:33:16] tonight wasn't standing in front of
[1:33:18] Abraham talking just like I'm talking
[1:33:20] now cuz how do you think we get it it
[1:33:23] com
[1:33:24] through the priesthood still right but
[1:33:27] not a levitical priesthood anymore not a
[1:33:30] priesthood of lineage anymore right but
[1:33:32] Jesus is the high priest and he speaks
[1:33:34] it to us and we speak it to you amen
[1:33:37] problem is sometimes we get our own
[1:33:38] speaking involved it's a law then
[1:33:40] against the promise of God God forbid if
[1:33:42] there had been a law given which could
[1:33:44] have given
[1:33:45] life in other words if the Ten
[1:33:47] Commandments is all we had and it was
[1:33:49] just in 10 pages and that's all we had
[1:33:51] in the Bible if it could have given life
[1:33:53] then he would have never should have
[1:33:55] never talked to Abraham right barely
[1:33:58] righteousness should have been by the
[1:33:59] law right but the scripture have
[1:34:04] concluded now wait a minute
[1:34:06] Paul you said we're righteous you said
[1:34:08] we're just ain't that what he just said
[1:34:11] in all scriptures before but the
[1:34:13] scripture have concluded what the law
[1:34:17] all understand right that the Promise by
[1:34:20] faith of Jesus Christ might be given to
[1:34:22] them
[1:34:24] that that's amen believe amen that's it
[1:34:31] now let's go to Hebrews 11 read that
[1:34:32] we'll be finished let's read what Paul
[1:34:35] said the great faith
[1:34:38] chapter listen to our now remember see
[1:34:42] Abraham's not our Father by anything
[1:34:45] except Faith
[1:34:49] amen Hebrews 11:8 you guys can put it up
[1:34:53] if you want to that's okay but we read
[1:34:54] it in our Bible by faith Abraham when he
[1:34:57] was called to go out into a place which
[1:35:00] he should after to receive for an
[1:35:04] inheritance I underlined that word
[1:35:08] twice obeyed
[1:35:12] yeah
[1:35:14] obedience and he went out not
[1:35:18] knowing whther he went
[1:35:21] right by faith he so sojourn in the land
[1:35:25] of promise see he was in that land the
[1:35:27] whole time right he was in the land the
[1:35:31] whole time he just didn't realize it
[1:35:34] amen you're in the workings of the new
[1:35:36] birth all the time right you just don't
[1:35:39] realize it yet
[1:35:41] right oh if we could just see
[1:35:44] that I wish I could open up the head and
[1:35:46] pour it in myself too by faith he
[1:35:49] sojourn in the land of promise as in a
[1:35:52] strange country dwelling in Tabernacles
[1:35:55] with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him
[1:35:57] of the same promise for he looked for a
[1:36:00] city which has foundations whose Builder
[1:36:02] and maker is God through faith also
[1:36:05] Sarah herself received strength to
[1:36:08] conceive seed and was delivered of a
[1:36:10] child when she was past age because she
[1:36:12] judged him faithful who had promised
[1:36:15] therefore spring there even of one and
[1:36:17] him as good as dead so many as the stars
[1:36:20] of the sky and multitude and the sand
[1:36:22] which is by the seashore innumerable now
[1:36:24] listen to this verse 13 look at that
[1:36:27] right there look up on the
[1:36:30] board these all died right in faith not
[1:36:36] having
[1:36:38] received
[1:36:39] amen
[1:36:44] exactly not having received the
[1:36:48] promises but having seen them AAR off
[1:36:52] right and were persuaded by them when
[1:36:55] that word them that's the promises yeah
[1:36:58] and were persuaded of them and embrac
[1:37:01] them and confessed that they were
[1:37:04] strangers and
[1:37:06] pilgrims on the
[1:37:08] earth they all died in faith not having
[1:37:14] received right the promises right so it
[1:37:18] must have been for another generation
[1:37:20] right must have been for another people
[1:37:22] verse 14
[1:37:24] for they that say such things declare
[1:37:26] plainly that they seek a country and
[1:37:29] truly if they had been mindful of that
[1:37:32] country from when they came out they
[1:37:35] might have had opportunity to have
[1:37:37] returned but now verse 16 but now they
[1:37:40] desire a better country amen that is in
[1:37:44] Heavenly wherefore God is not ashamed to
[1:37:46] be called their God for he hath prepared
[1:37:50] for them a city Glory by faith Abraham
[1:37:54] when he was tried offered up Isaac and
[1:37:56] he that had received the promise offered
[1:37:58] up his only begotten
[1:38:00] son of whom it is said that in Isaac
[1:38:03] shall thy seed be called accounting that
[1:38:06] God was able to raise him up even from
[1:38:10] the dead from when also he received
[1:38:14] him in a figure that's right what he
[1:38:17] received the figure of the promise amen
[1:38:20] but Isaac was not the promise
[1:38:23] Jesus Christ was the promised SE amen
[1:38:26] but now let's not do away with you and
[1:38:31] I because by faith they never received
[1:38:35] the
[1:38:37] promise right that's right Abraham Isaac
[1:38:40] Jacob
[1:38:41] Joseph they never received the promise
[1:38:45] all they lived in such Glory they lived
[1:38:48] in such Splendor they lived in a world
[1:38:51] that maybe sometimes you and I would
[1:38:53] would like to live in where God would
[1:38:54] just rain down all kind of
[1:38:58] blessings but they never received what
[1:39:00] they were looking
[1:39:04] for what about you and I right amen I
[1:39:08] leave that with you today by
[1:39:11] Faith by faith they believed by
[1:39:15] Faith by faith they believed it said by
[1:39:18] faith but they did not receive the
[1:39:21] promise because who was the promise
[1:39:22] given to not to seeds as of many that's
[1:39:27] right and Paul picked it up and said it
[1:39:30] was Christ in you amen the hope of glory
[1:39:34] right
[1:39:36] MDC was not talking to physical
[1:39:41] Abraham he was talking to me and you
[1:39:46] glory amen he was talking to me and you
[1:39:50] that's right cuz remember Abraham was
[1:39:53] The
[1:39:54] Promise by faith we're the faith Seed of
[1:40:00] Abraham but Abraham was not our savior
[1:40:05] right Abraham couldn't redeem us now
[1:40:08] through the same faith that Abraham
[1:40:11] had we could go toward that promise
[1:40:14] right but if we just had the faith of
[1:40:18] Abraham it said right there we couldn't
[1:40:21] receive the promise right yeah in other
[1:40:24] words what are you trying to say our
[1:40:27] faith and hope is built on nothing left
[1:40:29] Glory but Jesus blood and right Glory
[1:40:36] right all the songs sing in one person
[1:40:40] not Abraham right but through faith
[1:40:44] right we got the promise Glory if you
[1:40:48] got the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:40:49] tonight let's stand you got the promise
[1:40:52] you've got what MDC wanted Abraham to
[1:40:55] have but Abraham could not have it right
[1:40:58] in the condition that he was in
[1:41:01] right you say oh he's great yeah yeah
[1:41:05] the great father of our faith right but
[1:41:08] the promise had to not of the law or
[1:41:10] anything that Abraham or Abram
[1:41:13] did but it was speaking of Jesus Christ
[1:41:15] The Promised right and Abraham can't do
[1:41:19] anything to this group of people right
[1:41:21] here right
[1:41:24] this group of people right here can only
[1:41:25] be saved by Jesus Christ Glory can't be
[1:41:28] saved by D giby way Dale I wished I
[1:41:30] could Glory I wished I could but I
[1:41:35] can't but if you're
[1:41:37] ashamed to put your kids on this list
[1:41:40] I'm ashamed of you
[1:41:42] yeah
[1:41:45] okay but this
[1:41:48] list is going to stay with me brother
[1:41:51] Joe's got a copy of it
[1:41:53] if you want to add now listen I'm not
[1:41:55] talking about friends we all love our
[1:41:56] friends I want my friends to be saved
[1:41:58] too but I want my blood my family right
[1:42:04] family that's where my genetics natural
[1:42:07] are and Jesus you know the Bible says
[1:42:11] you'd be there with your
[1:42:13] offsprings and that was The Offspring
[1:42:16] Francis came from you and you and her
[1:42:18] you can't deny that right right right so
[1:42:21] we believe she's going where we going
[1:42:24] amen exactly I know you
[1:42:26] do but you know what Abraham walked 25
[1:42:29] years
[1:42:30] before Isaac's name was added to this or
[1:42:33] was taken off of this
[1:42:35] list right amen until the you understand
[1:42:38] until the promis son came right Abraham
[1:42:41] and Abram walked 25
[1:42:46] years calling these
[1:42:49] names you sure he didn't know Isaac's
[1:42:51] name you're not getting the point
[1:42:54] God made him a promise amen that's right
[1:42:57] of a promised seed a promised child that
[1:43:01] would carry on his genetics
[1:43:04] Glory now we're not talking about
[1:43:07] natural genetics natural genetics got us
[1:43:10] nowhere that's right even coming from
[1:43:13] Abra I mean coming from Adam his natural
[1:43:17] genetics I was reading it the other day
[1:43:18] brother R said Adam's seed natural
[1:43:21] polluted this whole world sure now how
[1:43:24] could that one seed do anything to save
[1:43:27] anybody if it killed the whole human
[1:43:31] race but we got to get away from that
[1:43:33] natural seed right and it wasn't coming
[1:43:36] from the loins of Abraham it's the faith
[1:43:38] Seed of Abraham now coming from the
[1:43:40] spoken word amen this right here spoken
[1:43:43] seed word this Jesus said plainly this
[1:43:47] is the seed that the SE went to seow he
[1:43:49] SED the word that's what we got to do
[1:43:53] get these people here it's not going to
[1:43:55] take a
[1:43:57] miracle it's just going to take
[1:43:59] believing the word
[1:44:02] amen Abraham and Sarah they they it
[1:44:05] wasn't a miracle they had that baby cuz
[1:44:07] you know what God told him he was going
[1:44:09] to and you know what he changed their
[1:44:12] body back so they could Glory Abraham
[1:44:14] and Sarah there's no way they could
[1:44:15] develop and have this right
[1:44:17] here
[1:44:19] Isaac no way brother Chris
[1:44:23] but they
[1:44:24] believed what God that's
[1:44:27] right and It produced this right let's
[1:44:30] bow oure dear heavenly
[1:44:35] father
[1:44:38] Lord we love
[1:44:41] you and we thank you that you've given
[1:44:43] us even an opportunity to stand before
[1:44:45] these
[1:44:47] people that you in the form of MDC
[1:44:50] looked at Abraham one time several
[1:44:52] thousand years ago
[1:44:53] go and said I'm going to have a promised
[1:44:56] group of
[1:44:58] people not seeds as of many of natural
[1:45:02] genetics but of a spiritual genealogy
[1:45:06] yes they come down through there in the
[1:45:09] Old Testament and was hidden in the
[1:45:12] law but father the law couldn't save
[1:45:18] anybody It could only push sin away
[1:45:23] but oh God you promised that you would
[1:45:24] come
[1:45:26] yourself with no natural genealogy on
[1:45:29] this
[1:45:30] Earth no Abraham as your natural father
[1:45:33] or Moses or anybody that was
[1:45:36] great father you came through the womb
[1:45:39] of a
[1:45:41] virgin you created the egg and The Germ
[1:45:44] and placed it in Mary
[1:45:47] and came onto the Earth Lord as a child
[1:45:50] and lived
[1:45:53] went through trials and troubles and
[1:45:54] heartaches
[1:45:56] and growth of life
[1:45:59] and
[1:46:02] suffered Lord and then you became a
[1:46:06] man and father you started sewing the
[1:46:08] word into the
[1:46:10] Earth you started speaking the gospel
[1:46:13] that was before the foundation of the
[1:46:14] world
[1:46:16] written and what MDC was trying to give
[1:46:19] to Abraham
[1:46:20] father you gave in a little man named
[1:46:23] Jesus
[1:46:25] Glory the only time your beautiful name
[1:46:28] was spoken is when you came on this
[1:46:30] Earth yes the name of Jesus Christ
[1:46:33] Glory that where all man was waiting and
[1:46:36] even you father was waiting for a time
[1:46:39] that you could fulfill that Genesis
[1:46:42] 3:15 that you would come through the
[1:46:45] womb of a virgin
[1:46:47] father with no natural genealogy to look
[1:46:50] back on to say it was great or or what
[1:46:53] more but Lord when you came on Earth
[1:46:56] they branded you as illegitimate and all
[1:47:01] these other things
[1:47:02] Lord being made from the purest birth
[1:47:05] that could ever be made in the
[1:47:08] world they called you the lowest name
[1:47:12] they could call
[1:47:13] you but father that didn't bother
[1:47:17] you you were still looking at a promise
[1:47:19] that you
[1:47:21] made that through the seat of the
[1:47:24] woman you would bring all this back yes
[1:47:28] and then you met a man named
[1:47:30] Abraham gave him the promise and then
[1:47:32] here you come down and fulfill that
[1:47:35] promise so
[1:47:36] that people
[1:47:38] like the names I called that have not
[1:47:41] come yet Lord and the ones that are here
[1:47:43] Lord that are that are called and
[1:47:46] Sanctified and filled with the Holy
[1:47:48] Ghost Lord that you can call us your
[1:47:51] children yes
[1:47:54] the very children that you wanted on the
[1:47:56] earth
[1:47:57] before there was all this
[1:48:01] chaos father you went on the cross with
[1:48:03] us on your
[1:48:05] mind and a list of names were stared
[1:48:08] before the foundation of the world Lord
[1:48:09] and then you came here to be
[1:48:12] crucified but that crucifixion didn't
[1:48:14] stop anything
[1:48:16] Lord you had a promise that it would be
[1:48:18] a seed that would come on the earth in
[1:48:21] the end time all down Through the Ages
[1:48:24] have been many brides and many things
[1:48:27] Lord but down here at the
