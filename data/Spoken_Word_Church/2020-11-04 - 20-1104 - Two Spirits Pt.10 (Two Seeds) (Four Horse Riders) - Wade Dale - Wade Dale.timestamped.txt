[2:17] let's go we're going to start again with
[2:19] uh back with the two spirits um we're
[2:22] finished with the uh
[2:25] uh speaking on the why does the heathen
[2:27] rage but i want you to
[2:29] i want you to understand one thing
[2:32] they're not gonna stop raging
[2:35] this is the beginning
[2:37] as brother dale said this is the
[2:38] beginning of the end
[2:40] everything's getting in place
[2:43] everything's getting in position
[2:45] i was talking to brother claude a few
[2:46] minutes ago and you know he
[2:49] having the virus and all
[2:52] people want if listen if you don't have
[2:55] a desire this virus or this or your
[2:58] tummy ache or your big toe hurts keeps
[3:01] you out of church
[3:03] that's what me and brother claw were
[3:04] talking about god's gonna find out and
[3:06] i'm not god god knows but you're gonna
[3:09] find out if you got like your daddy
[3:11] always said if you got the stuff
[3:15] he always talked about having the stuff
[3:18] and it ain't until it ain't at the
[3:20] picnic you find out if you got the stuff
[3:23] it's that the battle
[3:25] is when you find out if you got the
[3:26] stuff he's talking about having the
[3:28] baptism of the holy ghost to keep you
[3:31] and to get you
[3:33] from point a to point b b didn't he say
[3:36] i will lead you and guide you into
[3:39] all truth all right
[3:41] so it's this is a shaken time it's going
[3:43] to tell whether we got it or not and
[3:46] then you're going to be
[3:48] one of these two seeds that we're
[3:50] talking about are the two spirits two
[3:52] seeds but tonight we're going to speak
[3:53] on the four horse riders
[3:55] because remember
[3:57] brother branham tells us in the seals he
[3:59] said thank god for the opening of these
[4:00] seals for the many different doctrines
[4:03] he preached why am i against organized
[4:04] religion in 1959
[4:06] but he said in the seals was revealed he
[4:09] said i know now why i hate that thing
[4:14] the denominational spirit why he saw it
[4:16] in those horse riders but we're going to
[4:18] see if we can uh pick him out a little
[4:20] bit in the book of genesis
[4:22] and still continue on with the two twins
[4:24] but we're going to um
[4:27] background just a little bit since we
[4:28] hadn't been
[4:29] been speaking on this in a couple weeks
[4:31] so just bear with me first john 4 verse
[4:34] 1 and let's bow our heads just for a
[4:35] moment remember
[4:36] pastor appreciation bring your cards
[4:38] bring your gifts whatever you got next
[4:40] sunday
[4:41] for pastor appreciation sunday i'll be
[4:43] speaking so he can relax a little bit
[4:46] more
[4:47] and truly remember brother bob remember
[4:49] brother aaron will be in mobile this
[4:51] weekend
[4:52] and brother luis will be in jacksonville
[4:54] this weekend right brother okay just
[4:56] remember them as they travel
[4:58] and go and minister the gospel to these
[5:00] places thank goodness we can still go
[5:02] not like brother george quinn that they
[5:03] can only go two miles in ireland
[5:06] two miles
[5:08] think how you would be if you only could
[5:09] go two miles
[5:12] i couldn't hardly get gas
[5:16] yeah couldn't go walmart
[5:17] goodness
[5:19] what'd you bring that up for
[5:22] but you know what we we don't know
[5:23] what's coming we don't know with this
[5:24] next thing coming up we'll just just
[5:26] pray god will do
[5:28] for his bride
[5:31] i promise you
[5:32] but i'm telling you we're going to find
[5:34] out who's got it and who don't
[5:37] i was thinking today i was reading in
[5:39] the book of luke about ananias and
[5:41] sapphira
[5:42] brother ram said there'd be an anonymous
[5:44] in sapphira in the end time which meant
[5:47] it's not the people just going to drop
[5:49] dead
[5:50] could
[5:51] but they're going to spiritually die
[5:54] right in the middle of a church service
[5:56] and never be able to recover again
[5:59] never be able to recover again that's
[6:01] what that to me the anonymous fire
[6:03] experience is is that you bring iniquity
[6:06] into they brought iniquity in they knew
[6:08] they shouldn't have done that and they
[6:09] did it anyway
[6:10] so we just need to keep our minds clear
[6:13] keep our hearts clear keep our keep our
[6:16] conversation clear keep everything clear
[6:18] like i said brother louise was talking
[6:21] to other
[6:21] the other night you know you you just
[6:23] can't you need to keep it clean keep it
[6:25] clear if you got something against
[6:26] somebody you better go talk to him
[6:28] somebody got something against you go
[6:30] talk to him do something
[6:32] don't just let it fester because you
[6:33] know what it doesn't get any better
[6:36] until you confess
[6:38] never will it get any better
[6:40] until you confess your sins or confess
[6:42] your faults the bible says one to
[6:44] another amen so let's bow our heads
[6:48] thank you lord for this evening that you
[6:49] give us i pray lord that you would
[6:51] take the words that we
[6:53] have put together on this paper
[6:55] and lord just weave it through the heart
[6:59] of your bride
[7:01] lord may it never leave us
[7:05] may it lord be something that even if we
[7:07] come to a place we can't meet that lord
[7:09] will have enough
[7:11] as you told the prophet
[7:13] to store up the food
[7:15] well now lord these buildings are not
[7:17] store houses
[7:19] but we are the storehouse of the living
[7:21] god
[7:22] and lord we need to pack that food in as
[7:24] much as we can
[7:27] as the time approaches lord that we
[7:29] don't know what's going on but we know
[7:31] you hold tomorrow lord
[7:33] you're the one that
[7:34] orchestrated this from the foundation of
[7:36] the world you knew before knowledge what
[7:38] would go on
[7:40] and you made a way for your little bride
[7:41] father we thank you for that be with the
[7:44] sick ones that are among us here also be
[7:46] with brother bob and his family the
[7:48] different ones that are struggling with
[7:49] the virus the the list coming from
[7:52] brother dutch it's getting so long of
[7:54] different ones lord we pray that you
[7:56] would just minister to each one father
[7:58] and we'll have faith and it'll rise up
[8:00] lord that we'll
[8:02] not have to worry about this virus
[8:05] in your little bride but father we have
[8:07] to go through these things we pray that
[8:08] you would sanctify us for this journey
[8:11] you've already pressurized us
[8:13] now i pray that you'll sanctify us in
[8:14] the name of jesus christ
[8:16] amen all right
[8:18] so now let's first john 4 verse 1
[8:22] and if you've not if you've not been
[8:23] here for a while
[8:25] um and i'm not i mean in the service i
[8:27] mean in the church for a while
[8:30] brother dale preached on the seals way
[8:32] back in the 80s but he also preached in
[8:34] 95 and the different
[8:36] times about matching pieces but he also
[8:38] preached about the seals in genesis so
[8:40] we're just kind of redoing
[8:42] and renewing
[8:44] um and and not redoing
[8:47] you can't redo something that's so good
[8:49] you can't redo the word of god
[8:52] but we're going to bring it back to our
[8:53] attention because
[8:55] i feel that that's why the seals opened
[8:58] the seals open to break those two seeds
[9:01] apart
[9:03] because they were so close
[9:05] brother brown all many times thank god
[9:07] for the opening of the seals why he
[9:08] could see then because remember he
[9:11] preached the white horse rider was the
[9:13] holy ghost
[9:15] in his earlier ministry
[9:17] mighty conqueror i was just reading it
[9:18] just a few minutes ago even in the seals
[9:21] he said i'd have made a horrible mistake
[9:22] if i went by my notes what the notes
[9:24] were that that white horse rider
[9:26] must have been white so it must have
[9:28] been the holy ghost no that was that
[9:30] deceiver that had slid in under the
[9:32] garden of eden and hid himself in
[9:35] religion
[9:38] and in us
[9:40] okay so let's just let's go through this
[9:42] real quick first john four verse one
[9:44] beloved believe not every spirit
[9:46] but try the spirits
[9:48] whether they are of god that's what's
[9:50] happening now i believe
[9:52] because many false prophets are going
[9:54] out into the world
[9:56] hereby know you the spirit of god
[9:58] every spirit that confesses that jesus
[10:00] christ has come in the flesh
[10:02] is of god i really appreciate brother
[10:03] branham as many times as i hear brother
[10:05] brown preach on one god and line it up
[10:07] correct i like to hear him just continue
[10:10] to tell us
[10:11] about one god
[10:14] what he said you know when we were
[10:15] sitting here you know watch listening i
[10:17] believe that was very
[10:18] that kind of got us in the mind that
[10:20] jesus christ is almighty god but he had
[10:23] positions that he had to fulfill not one
[10:25] like your finger but not three like your
[10:27] finger he he said he pulled them two
[10:30] together and
[10:31] planted that tree and it became a great
[10:33] tree
[10:34] which is a revelation of one true and
[10:36] living god and you know what you're a
[10:38] part of that
[10:39] don't forget you're a part of all that
[10:42] you're part of the father son holy ghost
[10:44] you are part of jesus christ not a
[10:46] separate person
[10:48] a part of jesus christ amen
[10:51] so every spirit that confesses not that
[10:52] jesus christ has come in the flesh is
[10:54] not of god and this is that spirit of
[10:56] antichrist
[10:58] where have you ever heard that it should
[10:59] come and even now is already in the
[11:01] world
[11:03] year of god little children have
[11:04] overcome them because greater is he this
[11:06] in you
[11:07] than he that's in the world
[11:09] they are of the world therefore speak
[11:12] they of the world and the world heareth
[11:13] them
[11:14] we are of god
[11:15] he that knoweth god
[11:17] heareth us he that is not of god hereth
[11:20] not us
[11:21] hereby know we the spirit of truth
[11:24] and the spirit
[11:26] of error you may be seated in the lord
[11:28] address blessing
[11:29] to the reading of word
[11:31] let's go through the two quotes that
[11:32] we've
[11:33] been uh
[11:36] quoting now for some time and let's get
[11:38] our hearts and minds back together on
[11:39] the two
[11:40] seeds the two seeds that are not like
[11:43] this they've grown up together right
[11:46] man they've grown up together brother
[11:47] brown said they've intertwined right
[11:50] we'll read that in a little bit so let's
[11:51] bring up the first quote in the
[11:52] exposition of the church ages now
[11:54] remember this christ in the true church
[11:56] is a continuation of the book of acts
[11:59] but the book of revelation shows how
[12:00] that the antichrist spirit would come
[12:02] into the church
[12:05] defile it making it lukewarm formal and
[12:07] powerless now what did it do in the
[12:10] church ages
[12:11] that's where your horse riders were
[12:14] riding in those church ages hello
[12:17] they were there in the they were in the
[12:19] garden of eden this is not something new
[12:21] they were just exposed or brought to the
[12:23] forefront when brother branham broke
[12:25] when the seals broke to the prophet he
[12:27] could see where that rider came from
[12:30] and where it was going right
[12:33] so making it lukewarm formal and
[12:35] powerless do you read a few minutes did
[12:37] you hear what brother brown said
[12:39] remember a father son holy ghost is not
[12:42] it has no power
[12:45] right
[12:47] titles have no power right
[12:50] names have power
[12:53] but he gave them a little wink or a
[12:55] little nod to the church agents because
[12:57] what did brother brown say remember he
[12:59] was saying there i i wish we'd re do it
[13:02] over again he said why does that woman
[13:04] act the way she does she hadn't been
[13:06] taught
[13:07] so down to the church ages yes there was
[13:09] a true bride there was a true
[13:12] holy ghost filled bride but they had no
[13:16] idea
[13:17] that they were actually working part of
[13:20] the way in satan's domain
[13:23] because remember father son holy ghost
[13:25] baptism never ever came out of the mind
[13:27] of god never was a part of god
[13:31] that came from the pits of hell the
[13:32] prophet of god said but he allowed men
[13:34] because of the teaching that's why
[13:36] brother man had to come brother brown
[13:38] had to come and teach us
[13:40] and it separated the two seeds
[13:43] amen
[13:46] it
[13:46] exposes satan
[13:49] see he hasn't been exposed like he's
[13:50] been exposed now that's right
[13:54] this is the hour
[13:56] he's going to be so exposed what's he
[13:58] going to do he's going to be driven out
[14:00] of us and go into the beast
[14:04] and the world system and all the
[14:05] different things that you see coming up
[14:06] now
[14:08] with all this new all this new stuff
[14:10] coming up
[14:11] it exposes satan revealing his works
[14:14] attempted destruction of god's people
[14:17] and the discrediting of god's word
[14:20] now what did satan do to eve he describe
[14:23] he didn't say
[14:24] it's not right
[14:26] right he didn't say naive god's a liar
[14:31] he added one word to what god had
[14:32] already said
[14:35] that was it one word
[14:37] and the discrediting of god's word to
[14:39] discredit god's word is to be off one
[14:41] word
[14:44] right down to the time he is cast into
[14:47] the lake of fire he fights that he
[14:49] cannot stand it he knows that if the
[14:51] people get the true revelation of the
[14:53] true church and what she is
[14:57] what is she she's the sinless
[14:59] spotless
[15:01] no wrinkle
[15:02] bride of jesus christ amen we got to
[15:05] start realizing that that's not what
[15:06] we're coming to that's what we are
[15:09] amen
[15:10] and what she stands for
[15:13] and that she can do the greater works
[15:16] she will be an invincible army if they
[15:18] get a true revelation of the two spirits
[15:21] within the framework of the christian
[15:23] church now where did he see when that
[15:26] white horse rider came up that day
[15:30] when the revelation came brother branham
[15:32] was in the room and the rebel he was
[15:35] getting ready to preach his old notes
[15:37] that the white horse rider was the holy
[15:38] ghost
[15:39] and what would that have done that would
[15:41] have exalted satan just like it did in
[15:43] the garden of eden it would exalted
[15:45] satan to a position
[15:47] that he that he wanted
[15:50] but god wouldn't let the prophet do it
[15:52] amen
[15:55] thank god
[15:56] he wouldn't let the prophet do it so
[15:58] what did that do it exposed satan
[16:02] to being the while horse rider so we're
[16:04] going to see that in a little bit
[16:05] because remember it's a spirit
[16:09] it's a spirit of antichrist we read that
[16:11] right here in first john 4. it's the
[16:13] spirit of truth and the spirit of error
[16:17] like i said before don't try to put
[16:19] stamp names on
[16:20] people it's spirits we're fighting
[16:23] against not people
[16:26] okay
[16:27] so if you hear a certain brother preach
[16:29] error
[16:30] pray for the brother
[16:32] because he has been what he has been
[16:35] anointed by a wrong spirit right not
[16:38] that and he may not be wrong he may not
[16:41] be wrong he may have the actual baptism
[16:43] of the holy ghost that's what in the end
[16:44] time that the problem is
[16:48] is that you can have the baptism of the
[16:49] holy ghost and preach error
[16:52] but you won't continue to do it if
[16:54] you're exposed to the truth
[16:57] that's why brother brown had to preach
[16:58] those seals it exposed the truth
[17:01] and the error
[17:03] amen everybody okay with that
[17:05] so keep in your mind now that the four
[17:07] horse riders are what the white horse
[17:10] the black horse of the red horse the
[17:13] black horse and the pale horse everybody
[17:15] got that saying ma'am
[17:16] and then there were four combat beasts
[17:20] lion ox man and eagle that combated
[17:25] those four horses
[17:26] everybody got that same man because
[17:28] listen that's what we got to combat
[17:30] because remember when those four horse
[17:32] riders disappear that means you and i
[17:35] have also disappeared right
[17:38] right
[17:40] we're gone
[17:42] we're not on the earth anymore after
[17:44] that that's why the rapture takes place
[17:46] there on the fourth seal we've been in
[17:47] that we may get into it later on
[17:50] if they get a true revelation of the two
[17:52] spirits within the framework of the
[17:53] christian church and by god's spirit
[17:55] discern
[17:56] and withstand the antichrist spirit
[17:58] satan will be powerless
[18:00] before her let's read number two did you
[18:03] get that now get it now
[18:05] there are those twins again we were
[18:07] speaking on twins which is cain and abel
[18:09] we're going right back to them again
[18:11] there are those two trees again growing
[18:14] side by side
[18:16] in the same
[18:18] earth
[18:19] what earth is he talking about
[18:21] this earth right here
[18:24] oh no the devil ain't nowhere
[18:27] you're a liar
[18:30] because he still plays with this thing
[18:31] right here all the time
[18:35] can't get your soul if you're born again
[18:37] but those two trees are right there in
[18:39] your garden of eden that's right that's
[18:41] right
[18:42] working in your spirit realm
[18:45] telling you right now
[18:48] that somebody is doing something wrong
[18:50] and this one's saying something this you
[18:52] don't understand what i mean
[18:54] this is his playground
[18:56] why because that's the first womb his
[18:58] brother dale was talking about sunday
[18:59] that's the first wound that he entered
[19:01] in the garden of eden was this womb
[19:03] right here
[19:04] all right so now look so but god you
[19:07] know god chose the heart i know that but
[19:08] brother brown said it's got to come in
[19:10] here first
[19:11] then drop down because we all are
[19:13] feminist brothers
[19:15] and sisters so we have a spiritual womb
[19:19] which is right here your soul your heart
[19:21] the heart of you
[19:28] there are those two trees again growing
[19:30] side by side in the same
[19:32] earth
[19:33] partaking of the same nourishment do you
[19:36] know satan is partaking of the same
[19:39] nourishment when he walks in here he is
[19:41] a worship angel he is not some evil
[19:44] something but yes he is but he's so
[19:47] slick that he can come in and he can sit
[19:49] right here with you and just whisper
[19:51] things in your ear oh let's just worship
[19:53] god but forget about the preaching let's
[19:55] worship god and let's just let's then
[19:57] let's let's talk no he didn't say that
[19:59] right he's he's wrong here and he's
[20:00] wrong there you understand what i mean
[20:03] if he doesn't do you that way please
[20:04] pray for me
[20:07] please pray for me
[20:10] i mean really
[20:15] it's a battle amen
[20:18] drinking in the same rain what is rain
[20:21] the washing of the water the word right
[20:24] but remember
[20:25] it doesn't go
[20:27] in the people
[20:29] that don't have the baptism of the holy
[20:30] ghost but you that have the baptism the
[20:32] holy ghost that water goes inside of you
[20:35] you're washed by the water of the word
[20:37] you're you're what you're clean
[20:40] and set aside for service
[20:42] even being sanctified even with the
[20:44] baptism of the holy ghost there's a day
[20:46] that sanctification we know that amen
[20:49] and benefit by the same s-o-n oh
[20:52] s-u-s-o-n
[20:54] hmm
[20:56] i was reading in luke if you're reading
[20:57] the loop remember
[20:59] judas iscariot had a part
[21:02] of the ministry of jesus christ
[21:05] he was counted peter stood up and said
[21:07] he was counted as one of us
[21:11] preachers
[21:13] as brothers
[21:14] right until he did what he did
[21:18] so he preached the word of god
[21:22] he preached the message of the hour
[21:25] heal the sick
[21:28] raise the dead
[21:30] but remember he never went to pentecost
[21:32] so what did he do his reign was falling
[21:34] on the outside
[21:36] the anointing was falling on
[21:39] judas that never had a chance to go in
[21:41] judas because he went and hung himself
[21:44] before he could get to pentecost
[21:46] now watch that's the same spirit that
[21:48] came off a cane right
[21:50] but cain turns around and kills abel
[21:52] judas turns around and kills jesus
[21:55] you understand we'll get to that in just
[21:56] a second okay but they came from
[21:58] different seeds
[22:00] one tree is for the word of god exactly
[22:02] as god given and loves it and what obeys
[22:05] it the other tree is from the seed that
[22:07] is anti the word of god
[22:09] and changes it where it wants to
[22:14] it substitutes its own crews and dogmas
[22:17] for the living true word exactly as did
[22:19] who
[22:20] came who ended up killing abel
[22:23] listen cain didn't kill abel because he
[22:25] didn't like him
[22:29] he didn't he didn't agree with cain's
[22:31] doctrine
[22:32] we'll get to that in just a few minutes
[22:35] but fear not little flocks stay with the
[22:37] word keep that word between you and the
[22:39] devil eve did not do that and she failed
[22:42] and when the church lets down on the
[22:44] word she goes into the depths of the
[22:46] darkness of satan
[22:49] the depths of the darkness of satan this
[22:51] is the darkest hour that's ever been why
[22:54] is it the darkest hour we've got the
[22:56] greatest message that ever hit the face
[22:57] of the earth why is it dark
[23:01] because god's blinded the eyes
[23:05] one word off right
[23:07] not all this denomination we'll get to
[23:09] that in just a second when we get into
[23:10] the horse riders the law of reproduction
[23:12] let's let's continue on i just want to
[23:14] get your mind back in the back into the
[23:16] furrow
[23:17] of the ground that we've been plowing in
[23:22] let me tell you something
[23:25] i have felt horrible for a month not
[23:28] covered horrible
[23:30] but i have had just
[23:33] problems after
[23:34] problems last sunday i had to hold on to
[23:37] the pulpit
[23:38] or stun wings turn into before last to
[23:40] hold on to the pulpit just keep from
[23:41] falling over i've had these real dizzy
[23:43] spells and i have all these different
[23:44] weaknesses spells and all stuff like
[23:46] that
[23:47] but i feel good today you got to go
[23:50] through this man you got to push your
[23:52] way through this
[23:56] you can lay down if you want to right
[23:58] right but i choose to keep going
[24:01] you choose to keep going quit don't
[24:03] don't don't quit
[24:06] well i'm telling you i couldn't hardly
[24:08] turn my head without
[24:10] grabbing a hold of something
[24:12] but my blood pressure was fine and
[24:14] everything else is good it's just the
[24:15] old diablo
[24:18] right louis
[24:19] just the diablo the devil
[24:22] but i feel good tonight
[24:24] law of reproduction now remember
[24:26] god said let the earth bring forth grass
[24:28] the herb yielding seed and the fruit
[24:30] yielding fruit after his kind whose seed
[24:32] is in itself so every seed has to bring
[24:34] forth of its kind
[24:36] and yes when i was doing your mother's
[24:37] funeral also i couldn't hardly stand up
[24:39] on that pulpit
[24:41] but you know what
[24:42] we went through it
[24:44] we got through it just fine
[24:46] and you need to still pray for the
[24:48] family there the beautiful family man
[24:51] i learned i learned i learned enough
[24:52] about her mom to know who what kind of
[24:54] person she was and never met her day in
[24:56] my life
[24:59] but as i said before it took god
[25:01] breaking that ointment of
[25:03] of um that alabaster box so that we
[25:05] could smell
[25:06] the fragrance
[25:08] of sister barbara and i see it through
[25:10] the kids see
[25:12] you you see it through your kids
[25:15] and it was wonderful
[25:17] the funeral was one yes it's a wonderful
[25:19] time when you can see somebody that's
[25:21] that's went from
[25:23] death to life
[25:25] in their
[25:26] soul and they ain't gonna die no more
[25:32] but you can still smell the fragrance of
[25:33] her as she walked through as she walks
[25:35] through the earth and their children and
[25:37] the grandchildren they all did a real
[25:38] good job speaking of their of their
[25:40] grandma so i thank god for that that i
[25:42] was a part of it and i appreciate that
[25:45] and the earth brought forth grass and
[25:46] herb yielding seeds so every seed must
[25:48] bring forth of its kind satan knew that
[25:51] so he knew if he could get into the mind
[25:53] of eve then get into the womb of eve
[25:56] that god would have to make that seed
[25:59] come to life
[26:01] a human
[26:03] and human
[26:04] makes a human
[26:06] right okay
[26:07] it was just that satan couldn't use adam
[26:11] so he used the second best thing he used
[26:13] the beast
[26:14] which could coincide with eve
[26:17] and they could produce a cane
[26:20] now genesis 1 26 is the same law of
[26:22] reproduction and god said let us make
[26:25] man in our image
[26:26] and in our likeness but remember in
[26:28] genesis 1 26-28
[26:30] even verse 28 go down to 28 says be
[26:32] fruitful multiply replenish the earth
[26:35] and subdue it you think man these it's
[26:37] just
[26:38] never
[26:39] was it sexual
[26:41] never was it sexual it was it was always
[26:44] going to be spoken word seed children
[26:47] because how did
[26:49] jesus come
[26:53] even though he came through a womb it
[26:54] was spoken word
[26:56] seed children amen so you and i now
[27:00] because of our first birth we're dying
[27:03] but by our second birth which has
[27:05] nothing to do
[27:08] with humanity
[27:10] it's all the spoken word of god one day
[27:12] god spoke the word and it materialized
[27:15] inside of you right
[27:17] how simple is that but so profound that
[27:19] the world can't see
[27:21] that that was god
[27:23] bringing his children
[27:25] into being
[27:26] all right total part of god not a not a
[27:29] different substance
[27:31] that's god
[27:32] in another form we know now called the
[27:35] bride it took a prophet to tell us that
[27:36] that was a bride
[27:38] not every because you know what all
[27:40] denominations
[27:41] because of their teaching
[27:43] thinks this is all mankind
[27:45] and god said let us make man our own
[27:47] image well well that must be all mankind
[27:49] you hear you read a lot of commentaries
[27:50] well they said that is all mankind
[27:52] that is not all mankind
[27:55] that's his own self
[27:58] being made manifest in another form
[28:00] called the bride then we see in genesis
[28:02] 2 verse 7
[28:04] and the lord god formed man of the dust
[28:05] of the ground and breathed into his
[28:06] nostril the breath of life and he became
[28:08] a living soul and working towards
[28:09] something here and the lord god planted
[28:11] a garden eastward of eden there he put
[28:12] the man whom he had formed
[28:14] and out of the ground he made the lord
[28:16] god to grow every tree that is pleasant
[28:17] now remember in genesis 2 7 what did he
[28:19] do he then formed the human part of man
[28:23] and put the genesis 1 26 man into the
[28:26] man named adam
[28:28] that's right everybody got that say amen
[28:30] all right
[28:32] so what is jesus christ he is the second
[28:34] adam
[28:36] that doesn't need
[28:38] a woman
[28:40] hold on
[28:41] hold on he does
[28:43] but he doesn't need to plant a seed in a
[28:45] woman to reproduce you by the new birth
[28:49] it's by man we live by a woman we die
[28:53] amen my brother my answer quote brother
[28:55] brown tells us that but remember that
[28:57] woman was deceived
[28:59] but remember right here look he's he
[29:01] brings the separation
[29:06] colon
[29:07] this is his thought sure he brought
[29:09] every trees over adam and eve because
[29:10] there was fruit in the garden they were
[29:11] eating
[29:12] eating food okay
[29:15] but now this these two are not trees to
[29:17] eat off of as we know how to eat
[29:21] it's spiritually eating
[29:24] the tree of life
[29:26] and the tree of knowledge of good and
[29:27] evil they were right there in the garden
[29:29] side by side which was if you want to
[29:31] say it i'll say it if you don't want to
[29:32] say it then it was jesus christ or
[29:35] christ standing there and satan standing
[29:37] there
[29:38] and at one point brother brown says it
[29:40] was eve
[29:41] yeah was the tree of knowledge of good
[29:42] and evil why because that's what she
[29:44] partook of and once she partook of that
[29:46] tree of knowledge of good and evil then
[29:48] what
[29:49] they died we we all died right
[29:52] everybody got that say amen first
[29:54] timothy 2 verse 12. i know i'm getting
[29:56] i'm i'm treading water here but i'm
[29:58] trying to get something but i suffered
[29:59] not a woman to teach her ears up
[30:00] authority over a man but to be in
[30:02] silence for adam was formed first form
[30:04] then eve and adam was not deceived but
[30:06] the woman being deceived was in the
[30:08] transgression now look at this deception
[30:11] though the reason i'm still bringing
[30:12] this out that deception
[30:14] continues on till today
[30:17] because brother brown said eve still
[30:19] thinks she's right so it's the same
[30:22] spirit the same horse riders that are
[30:25] riding through the denominational world
[30:29] right you say oh that's meth is that
[30:31] that's me and you if we have our own
[30:33] creeds different from the word of god so
[30:35] don't just let's just don't push it
[30:37] outside remember brother braham said in
[30:38] the framework
[30:41] of the church
[30:43] he's talking about in this building
[30:44] right here
[30:45] this building right here and adam was
[30:47] not deceived but the woman being
[30:48] deceived was in the transgression now
[30:50] look the word deceived their deception
[30:52] means to cause to accept is true and
[30:54] valid what is false and invalid remember
[30:56] what i said before
[30:58] at nicaea
[31:00] satan was there and god was there
[31:03] and i see it rome 300
[31:06] excuse me
[31:09] 300 a.d they had a meeting satan was
[31:11] there and god was there doesn't matter
[31:12] how many men you
[31:13] like i said we're not talking about men
[31:16] brother brown said the prophets were
[31:18] there pr them old prophets the people
[31:20] they had the bride that had the word of
[31:21] god they brought the word of god to
[31:23] nicaea and satan was already there now
[31:25] look who won
[31:27] satan's creeds won over gods
[31:30] because man decided it right right
[31:34] and god's not gonna
[31:36] he's not gonna go over your free moral
[31:37] agency i'm telling you he's a gentleman
[31:40] right
[31:42] so the deception was though they accept
[31:44] it as true and valid what is false or
[31:47] invalid
[31:48] god literally had to wink at the
[31:50] ignorance of all of us because of the
[31:53] water baptism we were brought under and
[31:55] the
[31:55] eternal hells and all the different and
[31:57] even the things in the message the two
[31:59] souls and the seven thunder all the
[32:00] different
[32:01] doctrines
[32:03] that's rode through not here but written
[32:05] through our mind
[32:08] there's a deception there because you
[32:10] know what there's only one truth
[32:12] and there's one error
[32:14] there's only one truth
[32:16] that's the baptism in the name of the
[32:18] lord jesus christ one true and living
[32:19] god no eternal hell all the doctrines
[32:22] that the first church had but by
[32:25] 300 a.d
[32:28] it all went away
[32:30] sure i'm sure there was a few that held
[32:32] on but remember
[32:34] even luther and wesley were trinitarians
[32:36] they held on to those doctrines from
[32:38] nicaea that was so strong that horse
[32:40] rider was riding so close
[32:43] till it almost deceived the very elect
[32:46] through those church ages so don't think
[32:48] it's going to be any different now folks
[32:50] it is not going to be any different now
[32:53] it's just going to be at a higher level
[32:57] because we have the major doctrines you
[32:59] can have all the major doctrines lined
[33:00] up even paul tells us he said you can
[33:02] have all the revelation oh you have all
[33:03] that lined up and still not have the
[33:06] baptism of the holy ghost amen because
[33:08] i'll promise you i'll prove it to you
[33:10] when i was 14 years old i did not have
[33:12] the baptism of the holy ghost but if you
[33:13] asked some of these that were around me
[33:15] i could explain what happened in the
[33:17] garden i could explain there was only
[33:19] one true living god i could explain why
[33:21] that water baptism was in the name of
[33:22] the lord jesus christ but i didn't have
[33:24] god in my soul to quicken any of that
[33:27] to make it alive and make me where i
[33:30] make make me where i can use it
[33:34] and put it with other scriptures
[33:36] how many times have you done that you
[33:38] know you you've been in a boy come from
[33:40] methodist
[33:41] you read the bible and then all of a
[33:43] sudden you come into messing you read
[33:44] the same bible and you go why didn't i
[33:46] see that before
[33:48] it's written the same listen i was
[33:50] reading in the book of luke yesterday
[33:52] morning and i thought i had found
[33:54] another bible
[33:58] come on
[33:59] i read two or three scriptures and i'm
[34:01] like man i never see that
[34:03] and i've read luke 150 000 comes so have
[34:05] you why it wasn't time for the
[34:07] revelation yet a lot of things you just
[34:09] read over
[34:10] a lot of things you read over because
[34:12] you know what satan don't want you to
[34:13] know it number one
[34:16] but god you know what god will do
[34:18] because he's a good daddy he'll bring
[34:19] you right back to that place
[34:22] and he'll show you that
[34:24] he'll say it was right there all along
[34:26] it just wasn't time for you to get it
[34:28] but now in your journey you need it
[34:31] what a mighty god we serve matthew 6 22
[34:35] the light of the body is the eye if
[34:37] therefore thine eye be single the whole
[34:39] body shall be full of light
[34:41] but if thine i be evil now remember
[34:43] we're looking at the two we're looking
[34:45] at the the true and the and the false
[34:48] but if not i be evil thy whole body
[34:51] whole body
[34:53] shall be full of darkness
[34:55] if therefore the light that is in thee
[34:58] be darkness how great is that darkness
[35:00] there's your deception
[35:02] they thought listen kaiphas
[35:06] reading there in the book of luke
[35:08] confidence prophesied
[35:11] one man should die for the whole
[35:14] nation he prophesied
[35:17] he prophesied what was said in the old
[35:20] testament
[35:22] and god honored that
[35:24] but caiaphas was one that wanted him
[35:26] hung up on the cross
[35:29] look at the deception
[35:31] that's why jesus kept telling them he
[35:32] said if you'd have known abraham if
[35:35] you'd have known moses you keep quoting
[35:37] all these different quotes if you'd have
[35:39] known
[35:40] them you would have known me
[35:44] look at number three position of
[35:45] believer in christ
[35:49] let's just read the
[35:51] red part eve actually thought she was
[35:53] right
[35:55] but satan deceived her
[35:57] but he didn't deceive adam
[35:59] he knew it was wrong but because of the
[36:02] love for his wife he represented himself
[36:04] with sin and was condemned by the same
[36:06] now didn't jesus christ do the same
[36:08] thing
[36:09] sinless jesus christ took on your sin
[36:12] and cast and then now let me re-quote
[36:14] and cast out of the garden of eden look
[36:15] at number four why does it take to make
[36:17] what does it take to make a christian
[36:18] life
[36:19] the woman was actually deceived down at
[36:21] the bottom adam was not
[36:22] he knew what he was doing
[36:24] eve actually thought she was right she
[36:26] was getting some what new light now that
[36:29] light
[36:30] was darkness
[36:32] that wasn't light
[36:34] that wasn't the true light as in john
[36:36] says the true light that came into the
[36:38] world was jesus christ
[36:41] some new light that satan was giving her
[36:43] he's still
[36:44] giving her
[36:46] new light
[36:49] right
[36:50] now i didn't bring this quote but i
[36:52] remember brother brown said they had a
[36:54] holy ghost veil over their eyes
[36:56] to be naked and not be able to have any
[36:58] kind of sensation or emotion
[37:01] but when eve stepped out from under that
[37:03] she still thought she was doing right
[37:05] but she stepped into a lust veil to
[37:08] where
[37:10] you know what happened
[37:12] she had relations with the beast
[37:14] and therefore she had relations also
[37:16] with adam
[37:17] so she had two
[37:18] literal
[37:20] human seeds inside of her you understand
[37:22] what i mean when i said human seeds i
[37:24] know one of them was a beast but she had
[37:26] two literal seeds inside of her
[37:29] so watch this in genesis 3 14 says the
[37:31] lord god said unto the serpent because
[37:33] thou hast done this thou art cursed
[37:35] above all cattle above every beast of
[37:36] the field upon thy belly shalt thou go
[37:39] and thus shall tell you all the days of
[37:40] thy life
[37:42] and i will put enmity or division or or
[37:45] put a separation between thee and the
[37:47] woman in between thy seed and her seed
[37:50] it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt
[37:52] bruise
[37:53] his heel number five and oneness
[37:56] now notice the woman was not a seed
[37:59] remember a woman doesn't have a seed
[38:01] i will put enmity between thy seed and
[38:03] the serpent seed telling her what he was
[38:05] going himself to give her a seed not
[38:08] through intercourse
[38:10] sexually he's going to create in her
[38:13] a seed glory well you say would that be
[38:16] his seed yes it would belong to mary
[38:18] then after he give it to her this is my
[38:20] eye god give me this it's my eye god
[38:22] give it to me this is my hand he gave it
[38:24] to me this is my voice but he gave it to
[38:27] me see the seed was the mary had nothing
[38:29] to do with
[38:31] nothing to do with mary it was something
[38:33] god did himself
[38:35] so the seed that was in her now this is
[38:37] he's talking about eve now he switches a
[38:39] little bit here
[38:40] so the seed that was in her then was a
[38:42] union of an unlawful act which was death
[38:45] she was already pregnant with the
[38:47] serpent seed because she had lived with
[38:49] the and she turned and said herself the
[38:50] serpent beguiled me that's right and
[38:52] immediately came come on
[38:54] all we know she said she got a child
[38:56] from god certainly every child that's
[38:58] born remember she still thought she was
[39:00] right
[39:01] illegitimate and anything else has to
[39:03] come from an act of god satan knew that
[39:06] he knew god had to honor his word see
[39:08] satan is not a dummy
[39:10] he's a very very good
[39:12] adversary but remember
[39:15] brother brown said don't ever go on his
[39:17] ground without the baptism of the holy
[39:19] ghost
[39:20] amen
[39:21] because he will trap you
[39:23] all right so the seed that was in her
[39:25] then was the union of unlawful act which
[39:27] was death she was already pregnated with
[39:29] a serpent seed because she had lived
[39:30] with her in other words she lived with
[39:32] the beast and she turned and said the
[39:33] serpent began me that's right and
[39:34] immediately came come up all we know she
[39:37] had to get a child from god certainly
[39:38] every child that's born illegitimate or
[39:40] anything else has to come by an act of
[39:42] god he's the only one who can make life
[39:44] glory
[39:46] see she was already to be mother and
[39:48] that never only what it did was clear up
[39:50] the thing of the serpent seed the seed
[39:52] that's in you now is by concept this is
[39:55] god when he says i'll put enmity between
[39:57] thy seed and the seed of the woman
[39:59] this is what he's saying as brother
[40:01] braham's talking here the seed that's in
[40:03] you now is by conception in other words
[40:04] an unlawful act against my word
[40:08] with this thing here talking about the
[40:10] beast and you're you now got the serpent
[40:12] seed but i'll give you a seed by
[40:15] immaculate conception
[40:18] and his seed shall bruise the serpent's
[40:20] head and his head shall bruise the heel
[40:21] amen just let god have it
[40:24] if it's his word he'll bring it to pass
[40:27] all right so that the seed that was in
[40:29] we he knew that
[40:30] god knew she took that on and then she
[40:32] also took adam's natural seed but
[40:35] remember that didn't save her again let
[40:37] me warn you that
[40:38] that actually killed them both
[40:41] and every other person from the
[40:43] foundation of the world
[40:46] literally
[40:47] kane killed abel
[40:48] but
[40:50] if you want to
[40:52] put to blame you got to go back to
[40:53] playing on adam
[40:58] because when he did what he did that
[41:00] killed the whole human race right
[41:02] anything by sexual desire from then on
[41:04] had to die of natural death right all
[41:06] right
[41:07] everybody got that say amen
[41:09] all right now let's get down to the four
[41:11] horse riders here look genesis 4 verse
[41:13] 1.
[41:14] i brought my old bible brother donny
[41:16] because i got all my
[41:18] my cheat my cheat sheets in here
[41:24] genesis 4 chapter one is everybody okay
[41:26] it's eight o'clock we'll be done in
[41:27] about 30 minutes is that okay
[41:29] okay all right 30 minutes then we got
[41:31] 802 be 8 32. here we go
[41:34] genesis 4 verse 1
[41:36] and adam knew eve his wife and she
[41:38] conceived and bear cain and said i have
[41:40] gotten a man from the lord now look
[41:42] there there's your
[41:44] she never changed her doctrine
[41:46] right she still thinks she's right
[41:49] even
[41:50] as you come on across you look now
[41:54] i want you to understand
[41:56] when we preached this a long time ago
[41:59] we had a chart and i i couldn't find it
[42:00] i know brother joe could find it i
[42:03] preached on the ride
[42:04] where satan started his riding and god
[42:06] started his ride but if you'll go to
[42:08] james it says when lust is conceived it
[42:11] brings forth sin when sin is finished it
[42:13] brings forth death so let's look at the
[42:15] four horse riders because look when lust
[42:18] is conceived
[42:22] look what just happened
[42:24] it brings forth sin which was cain and
[42:26] abel
[42:28] doesn't matter right i know abel's
[42:30] righteous but he was born in sin right
[42:33] i'm sorry he's born in sin started and
[42:35] started wrong first to begin with
[42:38] when lust is conceived it brings forth
[42:41] sin
[42:42] when sins finished what did cain do to
[42:45] abel
[42:46] cain actually physically killed abel
[42:49] so let's read this now and go through it
[42:51] real quick
[42:52] everybody all right
[42:58] and adam knew his wife eve she conceived
[42:59] now we know there was two there was two
[43:01] acts
[43:02] we know that cain and abel were set of
[43:04] twins and we we not know that we do know
[43:07] that
[43:08] one was from the beast seed and when he
[43:10] was born he probably was a big hairy guy
[43:12] like his daddy was but he didn't ever
[43:14] see his daddy because god took that
[43:15] daddy out of the way
[43:17] so adam had to raise him and eve
[43:21] just the way it was and he didn't look
[43:23] like abel so see that's the first thing
[43:24] he didn't even look like his brother
[43:26] right because that was his half brother
[43:29] because i
[43:30] you know you you kind of giggle a little
[43:32] bit when people ask that well it said
[43:34] that he that um cain
[43:37] took his wife down to the land of nod
[43:39] and then the question came up with
[43:40] brother branham said well who was that
[43:42] said well it had to be a sister well
[43:43] well technically it was his half sister
[43:47] because remember when when when the
[43:49] serpent did what he did with eve there
[43:51] was no more conception of anything of
[43:53] that line he turned it into a snake
[43:56] so there was no more conception there
[43:58] was no more brothers or sisters that was
[44:01] born by the beast and eve
[44:03] that was done away with then it was all
[44:04] just adam and eve well then it was his
[44:07] sister that he took to
[44:08] to the land of nod which some of y'all
[44:10] are going to right now
[44:17] and she again bear his brother abel and
[44:19] abel was the keeper of the sheep but so
[44:21] look at the two
[44:23] look at the two here but cain was a
[44:25] tiller of the ground
[44:28] who would you have took
[44:32] like brother dale always says about
[44:34] we're going to see all we're going to
[44:35] head down through the
[44:36] we're going to head down through the
[44:37] bible and talk about
[44:39] esau and jacob and all the different
[44:41] ones and i i was thinking the other day
[44:43] and i think i may
[44:44] may do a sermon on the unsung hero
[44:47] you know you got your you got your ones
[44:48] of faith hebrews 11. you got all that
[44:51] great those great warriors of faith but
[44:53] what about those people that slide in
[44:54] and do something for god and you never
[44:56] hear no more
[44:58] because i was reading there in in luke
[45:00] and somewhere where that the disciples
[45:02] go there's a guy over here and he's
[45:04] preaching your he's preaching our
[45:06] message in other words shouldn't we shut
[45:08] him up the lord said no let him go
[45:11] we need more like that well that's an
[45:13] unsung hero what about the 3000
[45:15] downstairs that were from ethiopia they
[45:18] were from babylon they were from all
[45:20] those different places when they
[45:21] received the holy ghost the bible said
[45:23] the three thousand received the holy
[45:24] ghost they didn't stay in jerusalem
[45:26] because they weren't jerusalem people
[45:30] they didn't sound right they weren't
[45:31] jews
[45:33] thank you jerusalem people
[45:35] christine's wanted she shakes her head
[45:37] every time we do something like that
[45:39] she's so precise
[45:41] but what have those three thousand
[45:43] unsung heroes because you know what they
[45:45] fulfilled what jesus said go into all
[45:48] the world
[45:49] and preach the gospel there was three
[45:51] thousand little jesus or three thousand
[45:54] with a message that you never heard
[45:55] another word of about them
[45:59] but there's your unsung hero that took
[46:01] it to their nation
[46:03] that woman that went to where the woman
[46:05] from the well she went and sold what she
[46:07] went back to her country and said come
[46:09] see a man
[46:11] well that changed that woman for the
[46:12] rest of her life she testified many many
[46:15] many times
[46:16] those unsung heroes is the ones i want
[46:18] to talk to
[46:19] the ones that appear in the bible but
[46:20] you never hear any more and they just
[46:22] keep continuing on you know they took
[46:24] the gospel
[46:25] to the world
[46:27] hey man i like those kind of people
[46:29] i like the great heroes but i like those
[46:31] little ones that kind of pop up and
[46:33] like salmon you never hear nothing of
[46:35] salmon he's a great general you know and
[46:37] he's a great fighter in in
[46:39] joshua's army and then all of a sudden
[46:41] he marries rahab
[46:43] and buddy here goes
[46:45] obed jesse david
[46:48] solomon and all down the line and he
[46:50] just pops up one day and meets this
[46:52] prostitute
[46:53] what about god what a mighty god we
[46:55] serve
[46:56] how he orchestrates all that so we can
[46:58] talk about it
[47:00] and make our tops and shadows but let's
[47:01] continue on
[47:02] and the process of time look it came to
[47:05] pass they weren't children when they
[47:06] were talking they were kind of an adult
[47:09] because remember adulthood in that
[47:11] period of time you could be three or
[47:13] four hundred years old and still be a
[47:15] kid
[47:17] everybody all right with that if you
[47:19] live to be 900 years old read your bible
[47:21] there were several people there was like
[47:23] 140 before they had their first kid
[47:25] right
[47:27] 140
[47:28] you think they get it right by then
[47:32] but here's cain and abel though
[47:35] and you look at cain
[47:37] you look at abel
[47:38] cain's out here sweating in the field
[47:40] like esau bringing his produce in and
[47:42] bringing all the different things
[47:44] and he's making this beautiful
[47:47] altar
[47:49] abel's probably up there on the hill
[47:51] just got probably not uh not a million
[47:53] sheep ain't got many because it's the
[47:55] beginning of time
[47:56] he's got sheep up there but he's sitting
[47:58] back there you know and he's
[48:00] got his arms crossed and a straw
[48:02] sticking in his mouth a straw of of
[48:04] wheat in his mouth and just watching and
[48:06] then all of a sudden he gets up and he
[48:08] takes one of the animals he walks over
[48:09] there he sets it up on a rock doesn't
[48:11] matter i don't think he makes anything
[48:13] he just puts it on the flattest rock he
[48:15] can find and he don't have
[48:18] mom he didn't have no chicago cutlery
[48:22] mama likes chicago cutlery knives
[48:23] because they cut real good
[48:25] no he had a stick he had a probably a
[48:27] stick or a flint or something you know
[48:29] and he's over whacking this thing up and
[48:30] the blood's going everywhere and cain's
[48:32] probably rolling his eyes because cain
[48:34] has got a different attitude
[48:37] but you got to remember though
[48:40] there's going to come a point in time to
[48:42] where god
[48:44] is going to do the separating
[48:46] you and i can't separate because we look
[48:48] at cain and we look at esau and we look
[48:51] at even judas all the different ones in
[48:53] the bible that turned out wrong we
[48:55] thought he's the man of the hour
[48:58] this guy's a boy scout
[49:00] but he was the evil one
[49:05] but let's let god
[49:07] separate him for us
[49:09] so here we go let's read you ready
[49:12] and in the process of time
[49:14] it came to pass that cain brought of the
[49:15] fruit of the ground and offering them to
[49:17] the lord
[49:19] what was he doing he was going to church
[49:21] he was offering his fruit
[49:24] he wasn't off somewhere
[49:26] in the bar room do you understand what i
[49:28] mean he wasn't already down in a nod
[49:30] doing things he wasn't supposed to do
[49:32] no he was worshiping
[49:34] doing what he thought was right
[49:36] and abel he also brought us the
[49:38] firstling of his flock
[49:41] and of the fat thereof and the lord had
[49:43] respect
[49:45] unto abel
[49:47] and to his offering now right then and
[49:49] there
[49:50] we see that the doctrine of abel was
[49:53] correct
[49:57] because god accepted it right
[49:59] the offering of cain was wrong there's
[50:01] where your split starts but remember
[50:04] cain still thinks he's right
[50:06] right
[50:08] his mama thinks he's right
[50:10] cain thinks he's right now watch this
[50:11] here because now we're looking
[50:14] look in verse
[50:16] 5
[50:20] and i've got myself a note it takes
[50:22] christ to separate so see because cain
[50:24] and abel can't separate this even adam
[50:26] and eve and even know where to be found
[50:29] in this story the adam and eve is not
[50:31] anywhere
[50:33] so god is dealing with the twins
[50:36] because god said look in the bible
[50:39] capital l-o-r-d in verse four
[50:42] so the lord had respect to abel and his
[50:44] offering
[50:45] but in decaying unto his offering he had
[50:46] not respect and cain was very roth and
[50:48] his countenance fell
[50:51] now what did the lord do the lord here
[50:54] comes
[50:55] the separation but what does he give him
[50:57] first wake up
[51:00] what does he give him first he gives him
[51:02] grace
[51:05] god gives you grace first
[51:11] if thou
[51:13] and the lord said unto cain capital
[51:14] l-o-r-d so that's god speaking straight
[51:17] to cain
[51:17] amen
[51:20] why art thou wroth and why is thy
[51:23] countenance fallen
[51:25] if
[51:26] see look this is the lion
[51:29] the boldness of the lion god is bringing
[51:33] grace
[51:34] to cain but now what is this also this
[51:38] is that white righteous man fixing to do
[51:41] something
[51:43] because cain still thinks he's right
[51:46] and he's getting angry about it
[51:48] and he's going to tell god as like
[51:50] brother brown said i've got it written
[51:51] in my bible brother brown said
[51:54] cain looked at god and said take it or
[51:56] leave it right this is all i got
[52:00] man
[52:01] that's kind of bold isn't
[52:02] it but unto cain and his offering he had
[52:05] not respect and cain was very wroth and
[52:07] his countenance fell and the lord said
[52:09] unto the cain why don't thy wrath and
[52:10] why is i counting this fallen
[52:12] if thou do us well
[52:14] right
[52:16] if thou doest well
[52:19] shalt thou not be accepted amen
[52:24] and if thou doest not well
[52:28] sin
[52:30] lies at the door
[52:33] and unto thee shall be his desire and
[52:34] thou shalt rule over him what there was
[52:37] iniquity found in cain there was
[52:39] iniquity found in his daddy satan
[52:42] knowing to do right and not doing it
[52:45] don't you think god tried to tell he
[52:47] didn't he didn't just let satan go i
[52:49] believe he tried to tell satan don't do
[52:51] that or lucifer don't do this don't do
[52:53] that but he got mad just like this this
[52:55] guy's doing the same thing it's
[52:56] characteristic
[52:59] so now you see the white horse because
[53:01] cain thinks he's right
[53:04] he thinks he's righteous he's got some
[53:06] righteous indignation he's sitting on
[53:08] his white horse he says
[53:10] lord i'm doing what you told me to
[53:12] do i'm offering an offering
[53:17] but if you don't like it
[53:20] i ain't doing nothing else
[53:23] that's basically what cain said
[53:26] now watch so now that white horse
[53:31] is going to he's going to get off of
[53:33] that white horse and then he's going to
[53:34] do what he's going to get on a red horse
[53:37] everybody got that saying man
[53:39] white red
[53:40] black pale got it
[53:44] white horse
[53:45] brother branham said that white
[53:48] righteous
[53:49] church
[53:52] came
[53:52] thought he was right but he was the
[53:55] devil himself
[53:59] had anointed him everybody got there
[54:02] okay
[54:03] if thou do us well though here's grace
[54:05] here's the lion of the tribe of judah
[54:07] here is the lion the word is speaking
[54:09] telling you me satan the whole
[54:12] denominational world if you'll do what i
[54:14] say
[54:16] everything will be fine
[54:18] amen accept the word of god and do what
[54:20] he says
[54:22] if not
[54:23] then you're riding that white horse
[54:25] or he's riding in you
[54:29] which is a false doctrine to begin with
[54:33] so what happens here and cain
[54:36] talked with abel now he didn't just talk
[54:38] to him about stock market and what his
[54:39] new chevrolet looked like i said
[54:41] chevrolet and all those different things
[54:45] ford's work well they weren't invented
[54:47] back then
[54:49] but
[54:49] cain talked with abel about what went on
[54:53] cain talked with abel
[54:55] about what god just did
[54:58] cain talked with abel about why did he
[55:01] accept your sacrifice and why didn't he
[55:02] accept mine
[55:04] why did he consume your sacrifice
[55:06] brother brown even says
[55:07] that god came down and consumed abel's
[55:10] sacrifice in other words he burned it up
[55:12] and took it away but he had no respect
[55:14] to cain and cain's going why
[55:16] what is
[55:18] your problem cain never thought it was
[55:20] his satan ever thinks is his problem
[55:22] it's always your problem
[55:24] and cain talked with abel his brother
[55:26] and it came to pass when they were in
[55:27] the field
[55:28] that cain rose up against abel his
[55:30] brother and slew him not because he
[55:32] didn't like him he hated his doctrine he
[55:35] hated that god had respect to him so he
[55:38] got off his white righteous horse
[55:41] and got on the red horse
[55:44] which is blood
[55:47] abel
[55:48] the bible says abel's blood cried out
[55:51] from the ground
[55:54] everybody all right
[55:57] so here's your four horse riders right
[55:59] here in the right here in the first part
[56:01] of the book of genesis
[56:03] because remember
[56:06] when lust is conceived
[56:11] there's your conception
[56:13] because that's two things coming
[56:14] together
[56:16] satan brings it to abel and abel says
[56:20] it was blood
[56:23] it was blood
[56:24] kane says no it's the fruit of the
[56:26] ground mama told me she ate an apple
[56:29] denominational mama you understand what
[56:31] i mean
[56:32] because she listen
[56:34] even knew it wasn't an apple
[56:36] jesus wanted to partook
[56:39] amen
[56:41] see how slick the devil is
[56:43] but he got off his white horse his white
[56:45] righteous horse and what happened is is
[56:48] just like in the you look in the seals
[56:50] where he gets off the white horse the
[56:53] white horse continues to ride
[56:56] amen because it's that same white
[56:58] righteous church that rides through esau
[57:03] that rides through all those different
[57:05] down through the old testament
[57:07] uh and i mean um
[57:09] oh come on brain moses and
[57:13] dayton and court thank you nathan and
[57:15] cora
[57:16] i do need help every once in a while
[57:18] nathan and cora that thing just keeps
[57:20] riding because they think they're right
[57:24] caiaphas got on his white horse right he
[57:28] said that man ain't gonna tell me what
[57:29] to do
[57:30] i'm god's servant
[57:32] i'm the man of the hour you know what he
[57:34] was
[57:36] if he'd have done it right
[57:38] that's why i said yeah that's why i said
[57:41] cain
[57:42] if he would have accepted what god said
[57:44] right you wouldn't have had that problem
[57:46] right there
[57:48] same way with me and you as that white
[57:50] horse writes through me and you
[57:54] if you don't kill it
[57:56] it's going to kill you
[57:59] it's going to manifest or conception is
[58:01] going to come forth when lust is
[58:03] conceived cain got so lustful not
[58:05] lustful than like we're talking about
[58:07] but you can lust for things
[58:09] cain was lusting for power he was
[58:11] actually lusting for somebody to say
[58:14] you're right cain you're right
[58:17] you're right
[58:19] see that's why they couldn't stand
[58:21] brother branham because they wanted
[58:22] brother branham to say you're right or
[58:25] i'm talking about the nomination or
[58:27] can you just compromise just a little
[58:30] bit over here can you hear that
[58:33] and there stands that line of the tribe
[58:35] of judah inside brother branham and he
[58:36] says no
[58:38] no compromise
[58:40] i will not compromise because the holy
[58:41] ghost had come to a place to where he
[58:43] was not going to compromise anymore
[58:46] he compromised in the church ages sorry
[58:49] he accepted water baptism like it was
[58:52] because of what the teaching of people
[58:56] just because that right there cain
[58:58] talked with abel his brother and it came
[58:59] to pass when they were in the field that
[59:01] cain rose up against abel his brother
[59:03] and slew him it had built up so much
[59:05] rage into him until he killed him
[59:09] what killed abel though his doctrine is
[59:11] what killed him
[59:17] what kills us if we preach a true
[59:19] doctrine and then somebody turns us down
[59:23] brother brown said you kill the man's
[59:24] doctrine you kill the man
[59:27] but this was physical killing
[59:29] even in the dark ages we see that the
[59:31] red horse brother brown said that red
[59:33] horse rode through the blood of the
[59:34] saints
[59:36] because it was literal killing
[59:39] but remember
[59:41] this was a literal killing also
[59:44] this is the red horse
[59:48] riding through
[59:50] cain's doctrine every it's a die it's
[59:52] not a person
[59:55] he gets in the doctrine and that
[59:56] doctrine gets into people
[1:00:02] beware of that
[1:00:04] that it doesn't get into us
[1:00:09] so let's continue on real quick
[1:00:12] so we've got the white horse we've got
[1:00:14] the red horse
[1:00:18] and the lord said in the cane where's
[1:00:19] abel thy brother
[1:00:22] and he lied straight to god
[1:00:26] see how when lust is conceived now
[1:00:28] listen
[1:00:29] hold on a minute lust is not bad
[1:00:32] hold on a minute
[1:00:34] when lust is conceived it brings forth
[1:00:36] sin when sin is finished
[1:00:40] it brings forth death you and i were all
[1:00:43] born under that lust veil
[1:00:47] that eve took off
[1:00:49] for knowledge
[1:00:51] we were all born under that
[1:00:53] but god made a provision for you and i
[1:00:56] not to stay underneath that because he
[1:00:58] wants to put that holy ghost veil back
[1:01:01] on you
[1:01:03] because there's your protection
[1:01:07] adam and eve were protected when they
[1:01:08] had that that holy ghost veil over him
[1:01:11] but when she stepped out from it and put
[1:01:13] a lust veil on look what happened
[1:01:17] he said i know not am i my brother's
[1:01:19] keeper
[1:01:21] oh my saying it directly to god lord
[1:01:23] look capital l-o-r-d
[1:01:26] this wasn't from a second person or this
[1:01:27] wasn't from a prophet god was speaking
[1:01:29] straight to cain
[1:01:34] god's speaking to me and you same way
[1:01:37] amen all right let's continue on
[1:01:41] am i my brother's keeper
[1:01:43] and he said what has now done and the
[1:01:45] voice of thy brother's blood
[1:01:48] crieth unto me
[1:01:50] from the ground
[1:01:52] the voice of all those martyrs remember
[1:01:54] when you go in the book of revelations
[1:01:56] where she has a cup that's full of the
[1:01:59] blood of martyrs where satan through the
[1:02:02] doctrine
[1:02:04] the doctrine in the dark ages the
[1:02:06] doctrine that began with even with what
[1:02:09] they call the crusade you know the
[1:02:11] crusade was nothing more than just if
[1:02:13] you don't agree with me i'm going to
[1:02:14] kill you well that's the same thing cain
[1:02:16] did
[1:02:17] it's the same devil he never dies until
[1:02:19] the very end thank god
[1:02:25] now watch
[1:02:30] thy brother's blood crieth unto me
[1:02:33] from the ground
[1:02:35] and now watch now this is
[1:02:38] this is
[1:02:39] um
[1:02:40] white horse red horse now we're heading
[1:02:42] to the black horse because what is the
[1:02:44] black horse now look the black we know
[1:02:46] is death right but it's not called death
[1:02:49] until
[1:02:51] number four right
[1:02:52] remember the one that's on the horse is
[1:02:55] now called death in the fourth stage not
[1:02:57] the third stage
[1:02:58] third stage is black
[1:03:01] and now art thou cursed
[1:03:05] from the earth
[1:03:08] you're cursed
[1:03:10] when lust is conceived brings forth sin
[1:03:13] when sin is finished we're going to read
[1:03:14] in a minute that this really simple
[1:03:18] subject tonight
[1:03:19] is going to come down
[1:03:21] to where the bible says
[1:03:23] and cain
[1:03:25] walked away
[1:03:26] from the presence of the lord
[1:03:32] there's your death right
[1:03:35] not your black horse
[1:03:37] we know that's coming to death
[1:03:39] but it's not called death until the
[1:03:41] fourth stage
[1:03:43] and now art thou curse now what see now
[1:03:45] look god didn't kill cain he actually
[1:03:47] puts a mark on cain and tells people not
[1:03:50] to kill him
[1:03:52] why because he wants that witness
[1:03:55] to go into other parts of the world
[1:03:59] because god's got to have a witness good
[1:04:01] and bad
[1:04:02] and now art thou cursed from the earth
[1:04:04] which hath opened her mouth to receive
[1:04:06] thy brother's blood from thy hand
[1:04:11] when thou tillest the ground
[1:04:13] remember lion ox man i didn't cover the
[1:04:16] ox but we don't have time man he's
[1:04:18] talking to cain the man
[1:04:21] he's talking to the man cain
[1:04:25] and cain right now
[1:04:27] is a murderer
[1:04:29] but remember
[1:04:31] show me where cain repented
[1:04:36] he never repented
[1:04:39] cain said unto the lord
[1:04:41] oh no when thou tillest the ground it
[1:04:43] shall not hand forth yield unto thee her
[1:04:45] strength
[1:04:46] and a fugitive and a vagabond shall be
[1:04:49] in the earth and cain said unto the lord
[1:04:51] and speaking straight to god my
[1:04:52] punishment is greater than i can bear
[1:04:55] why the world are you putting all this
[1:04:56] on me
[1:04:58] he's not repenting a bit about just
[1:04:59] killing his brother with his own bare
[1:05:01] hands
[1:05:02] cause remember this is not a long length
[1:05:04] of time
[1:05:05] god's coming down and saying where's
[1:05:07] your brother
[1:05:08] i don't know where he's at ain't none of
[1:05:10] my business he says
[1:05:13] but cain now talks back to the lord my
[1:05:15] punishment is greater than i can bear
[1:05:16] behold thou hast driven me out this day
[1:05:18] from the face of the earth
[1:05:20] and from thy face shall i be hid i shall
[1:05:23] be a fugitive in the vagabond in the
[1:05:24] earth and it shall come to pass that
[1:05:26] everyone that findeth me
[1:05:27] in other words shall want to slay me
[1:05:29] wow
[1:05:31] and look it's all about him
[1:05:35] no repentance
[1:05:37] no sorrowfulness no nothing no
[1:05:40] he really don't care right right
[1:05:43] he's just worried about himself
[1:05:46] now what is that
[1:05:48] look at that and i don't want to say
[1:05:50] this too loud
[1:05:53] but isn't that what a denomination is
[1:05:56] that's my brother brandon when no seals
[1:05:58] broke and he saw them white horse riders
[1:06:00] riding through them denominations he
[1:06:02] looked at that right there
[1:06:05] have you ever heard a baptist
[1:06:07] repent of being a baptist
[1:06:10] no that's their life
[1:06:13] have you heard a methodist ever say i'm
[1:06:14] sorry for being a methodist now we did
[1:06:16] when we come into the light of the
[1:06:17] message okay we did because we had a
[1:06:20] repentant attitude we're not we're the
[1:06:21] able side now on the south side we're
[1:06:23] not we're not the king side but if you
[1:06:25] stayed in now how many people have you
[1:06:26] you know you tell
[1:06:28] i've been changed that baptism is wrong
[1:06:30] you're baptized oh don't tell them that
[1:06:33] cain will rise up
[1:06:35] right can't that cane spirit will rise
[1:06:38] up
[1:06:40] and say what do you mean i'm wrong
[1:06:43] what do you mean i'm wrong
[1:06:45] see that attitude
[1:06:48] there's the black horse
[1:06:51] if that light
[1:06:53] and thee
[1:06:54] be darkness
[1:06:56] how great is that dark horse that's
[1:07:00] riding through us now
[1:07:01] how great is that dark horses riding
[1:07:03] through the world how great is that dark
[1:07:04] horse that's riding right through the
[1:07:06] denominations that's why when the seals
[1:07:07] broke brother brown saw where the devil
[1:07:09] was at
[1:07:12] number one he saw he was close to really
[1:07:13] close to him but he also knew he said i
[1:07:16] wondered why i didn't like them
[1:07:18] denominations why because it's the seed
[1:07:20] of satan
[1:07:21] sorry the people are good remember i'm
[1:07:23] not talking about people
[1:07:25] i'm talking about the spirit that
[1:07:26] they're under but now remember
[1:07:30] remember when lust is conceived bring
[1:07:31] forth sin when sin is finished it brings
[1:07:33] forth death so if they continue in that
[1:07:36] there's nothing you can do for
[1:07:38] same way with cain remember he continued
[1:07:40] in his doctrine never changed his
[1:07:42] doctrine one bit
[1:07:44] right
[1:07:45] never repented never said i'm sorry
[1:07:47] never said let me back in the garden
[1:07:49] he's saying right now
[1:07:52] scroll back down to here
[1:07:53] the next one thinking behold thou has
[1:07:55] driven me out this day he's thinking
[1:07:57] about me
[1:07:59] his own self
[1:08:01] what do you mean by doctrine of
[1:08:04] the baptist and methodist and
[1:08:05] pentecostal and half the people in the
[1:08:07] message
[1:08:09] hello
[1:08:10] listen them horse riders are right here
[1:08:14] they ain't out there they're right here
[1:08:19] behold thou has driven me out this day
[1:08:20] from the face of the earth and from thy
[1:08:22] face shall i be healed
[1:08:25] now god didn't tell him that
[1:08:27] he did
[1:08:29] the devil is pronounced earth sorry
[1:08:32] cain is pronouncing his own judgment
[1:08:34] right
[1:08:35] isn't that what we're going to do
[1:08:37] sure we're going to pronounce our own
[1:08:39] judgment
[1:08:43] and the lord said unto him therefore
[1:08:45] whosoever slayeth cain vengeance shall
[1:08:46] be taken on him sevenfold and the lord
[1:08:49] said a mark upon
[1:08:50] cain now remember this was brought up in
[1:08:53] the in the message
[1:08:55] and they asked a question and they
[1:08:57] thought the mark that was put on cain
[1:09:00] was black
[1:09:02] folks black people that's not true
[1:09:05] that has never been true i don't care i
[1:09:07] don't care what you think
[1:09:09] the mark in me and you is black
[1:09:14] all of us
[1:09:15] i'm talking about the blackness of the
[1:09:17] devil
[1:09:18] i don't care what your skin color is
[1:09:20] there's not a mark
[1:09:22] put upon nobody except you was born
[1:09:25] wrong
[1:09:27] i don't care who you are
[1:09:28] we were all born wrong
[1:09:31] and if you're not born again you're
[1:09:33] still born wrong
[1:09:35] cain is still wrong he's still wrong he
[1:09:38] thinks he's right the horse riders are
[1:09:40] still riding through
[1:09:42] all the way to today
[1:09:44] cause nobody's gonna kill him god's
[1:09:46] gonna let that doctrine ride all the way
[1:09:49] to the end time
[1:09:52] and head up into this right here right
[1:09:56] death
[1:09:58] and cain
[1:09:59] that's what killed cain not physically
[1:10:02] killed cain because he lived hundreds
[1:10:04] and hundreds and hundreds hundreds of
[1:10:05] years
[1:10:07] what killed cain was is he left the
[1:10:10] presence of god exactly right that's
[1:10:12] right
[1:10:13] so when lust is conceived brings forth
[1:10:15] sin when sin is finished
[1:10:18] right here
[1:10:19] cain's sin is finished he's sealed
[1:10:24] but he's not sealed with the holy ghost
[1:10:26] he's sealed with the seal of satan
[1:10:29] all the way to the end time
[1:10:31] because he
[1:10:32] god never said
[1:10:34] one time i'm gonna drive you out of the
[1:10:36] garden no cain says you i gotta leave
[1:10:38] the guard he's telling god what he's
[1:10:39] gonna do
[1:10:40] god never says
[1:10:42] anywhere i'm going to get you
[1:10:46] did he
[1:10:48] he never even said cain you're doomed
[1:10:53] cain
[1:10:54] decided to leave
[1:10:56] the presence of the lord
[1:10:59] and dwelt in the land of god
[1:11:01] on the east of eden
[1:11:04] when lust is conceived brings forth sin
[1:11:06] when sins finished
[1:11:08] brings forth not listen natural death is
[1:11:11] not even close to spiritual death
[1:11:14] amen
[1:11:15] spiritual death now look there is no
[1:11:17] eternal hell but there is an eternal
[1:11:19] judgment
[1:11:21] everybody got that
[1:11:22] because once you seal yourself out
[1:11:25] you're going in that direction
[1:11:27] so there's an eternal judgment the bible
[1:11:29] even tells us there's an eternal
[1:11:30] judgment
[1:11:31] but
[1:11:33] cain decided it right here because you
[1:11:35] never hear now you know there's a
[1:11:36] lineage of cain and you know there's
[1:11:38] different things but cain's never
[1:11:39] mentioned again except the bad parts
[1:11:42] right
[1:11:43] he's never mentioned again
[1:11:46] he just kind of
[1:11:48] goes off
[1:11:50] but remember though
[1:11:52] his doctrine lives till today
[1:11:55] his doctrine lives to right now
[1:11:59] in that pale horse
[1:12:01] of spiritual death
[1:12:03] all the white the red
[1:12:06] the black mixed together
[1:12:08] that whole journey
[1:12:10] that cain took from the time he was born
[1:12:13] until the time when he killed his
[1:12:14] brother up until the time that he
[1:12:16] rejected god and then he left from the
[1:12:18] presence
[1:12:19] that's all wrapped up in that pale horse
[1:12:22] and that pale horse
[1:12:24] is death
[1:12:25] but guess what folks
[1:12:27] there's also a line ops a man and an
[1:12:29] eagle
[1:12:31] and the and the eagle brings us back
[1:12:34] into the presence of the lord
[1:12:38] this this pale horse drives you away
[1:12:40] from the presence of the lord but thank
[1:12:42] god for the eagle anointing in this end
[1:12:44] time
[1:12:46] that brought us a prophet
[1:12:48] that brought us a message that took us
[1:12:51] out
[1:12:51] come out of her my people
[1:12:55] not come out of her and leave me the
[1:12:56] presence of the lord no walk back into
[1:12:59] the presence of the lord
[1:13:01] cain could have done the same thing
[1:13:04] he could have stayed and god would have
[1:13:06] blessed him
[1:13:08] but he decided to leave
[1:13:12] nicea decided to leave the word of god
[1:13:16] because satan was there in those people
[1:13:19] anointing them and they were the
[1:13:21] religious people of the world
[1:13:25] do you know it literally took them 300
[1:13:27] extra years to get that doctrine started
[1:13:30] from 300 to 606.
[1:13:33] 306 years they had another nice sea of
[1:13:36] council them people been dead for a long
[1:13:38] time
[1:13:40] but that new group come up that new king
[1:13:42] member that same doctrine
[1:13:44] walks right back in there 300 years
[1:13:46] later
[1:13:47] and says okay we're adopting this now
[1:13:49] we're going to have father-son holy
[1:13:50] ghost baptism
[1:13:52] jesus was a separate person from god
[1:13:55] hell is eternal there's now a purgatory
[1:13:57] in between there
[1:13:59] you see what i'm saying
[1:14:00] satan just upped his game
[1:14:03] satan just upped his game he upped his
[1:14:05] game when he went into esau and all
[1:14:06] these different ones but here is that
[1:14:08] ride that he took
[1:14:11] but when you come to the very end
[1:14:14] satan left of his own accord
[1:14:17] and there's your twins but remember
[1:14:19] it's not
[1:14:21] musicians come
[1:14:22] it is not an exact people it's not a
[1:14:24] seed line
[1:14:26] it's not a natural seed line
[1:14:29] i don't care where you came from
[1:14:32] i don't care who your mama and your
[1:14:34] daddy is
[1:14:36] if you're born again you have moved out
[1:14:38] of that family anyway
[1:14:41] you have moved out of that cane movement
[1:14:44] and you've moved into abel where it's
[1:14:46] got i mean which seth and then begot
[1:14:48] this one and we got that one and come on
[1:14:50] down
[1:14:51] to jesus christ
[1:14:53] you and i are in that lineage because of
[1:14:55] the new birth not because of a natural
[1:14:58] seed
[1:15:00] the natural seeds what's killing you
[1:15:05] let's read these last two quotes well
[1:15:07] i'll just read
[1:15:08] them you jump together no i'll just read
[1:15:11] them
[1:15:12] whenever that's you did what you're
[1:15:13] supposed to do whenever there is a
[1:15:15] revival it always produces twins
[1:15:19] that's a rude remark but it's true when
[1:15:21] there was a birth out of from isaac and
[1:15:24] rebecca it produced twins
[1:15:26] when the world was created it produced
[1:15:29] twins two trees
[1:15:31] tree of knowledge of good and evil the
[1:15:33] tree of life
[1:15:34] and when cain and abel were born
[1:15:36] it produced two
[1:15:38] when ishmael and isaac was born it
[1:15:41] produced two
[1:15:42] i forgot about ishmael and when esau and
[1:15:44] jacob was born it produced two
[1:15:47] one of them natural one of them of the
[1:15:49] earth the other one supernatural and one
[1:15:52] looked at the natural
[1:15:54] cane intelligence
[1:15:56] worker of the ground and the other one
[1:15:58] walked by the spirit it's always been
[1:16:01] that way
[1:16:02] power transformation let's stand to our
[1:16:04] feet
[1:16:05] number seven there is always twins
[1:16:08] and that's the reason don't forget this
[1:16:10] little flock now this is 1965 after the
[1:16:13] seals were open
[1:16:14] the church is in the last days the
[1:16:17] church in the last days is going to be
[1:16:19] twins
[1:16:20] so close it will deceive the elected
[1:16:23] matthew 24 24 the church is going to
[1:16:26] it's a pentecostal
[1:16:28] move
[1:16:31] it's so much like the real thing till it
[1:16:33] would deceive the very elect if it were
[1:16:35] possible
[1:16:36] and a little later on if i get the
[1:16:38] chance i want to explain
[1:16:40] what how the election comes see it's
[1:16:42] going to deceive them because it's
[1:16:44] almost
[1:16:46] like the same thing
[1:16:48] see just two fathers that's all
[1:16:52] same mother
[1:16:53] same church
[1:16:56] same movement
[1:16:58] same thing
[1:17:01] but it's two daddies
[1:17:03] what is the mother's church church is
[1:17:05] always a woman right that's what he's
[1:17:07] talking about i'm not this is not his
[1:17:08] quote now i'm going back to what he's
[1:17:09] saying
[1:17:10] the betting ground is the same
[1:17:14] where the word falls
[1:17:16] but one of them
[1:17:18] is perverted
[1:17:21] you understand say amen
[1:17:23] see one of them is a perversion because
[1:17:25] it's the wrong father which i will prove
[1:17:28] someday if god will let me that
[1:17:30] denomination is the mark of the beast
[1:17:33] see it's the wrong father he is stirring
[1:17:36] people to an organization instead of the
[1:17:39] word see
[1:17:41] it's the wrong father
[1:17:43] it's a cain movement
[1:17:46] wow
[1:17:50] why am i against organized religion
[1:17:52] it's not the people
[1:17:55] it's that thing that looks so close
[1:17:58] right
[1:17:59] it's the white horse
[1:18:01] don't tell them that people are are
[1:18:03] filthy
[1:18:05] i was talking to our neighbor yesterday
[1:18:08] jerry ferguson
[1:18:10] good methodist good methodist good
[1:18:12] methodist good neighbor
[1:18:15] he said you know what
[1:18:17] he said i stood up in the church the
[1:18:19] other day
[1:18:20] and i was surprised he did that
[1:18:22] and he said i told them people
[1:18:24] that there's no way a christian to vote
[1:18:26] democrat
[1:18:28] i looked at him
[1:18:30] you said that to them people and you're
[1:18:32] still alive
[1:18:35] because it's true
[1:18:38] but you see that's the denominational
[1:18:39] idea
[1:18:40] because he was looking at the abortion
[1:18:42] and everything the democratic party
[1:18:43] stands for and i think it's all of the
[1:18:45] devil we know that
[1:18:47] but for him to say that though
[1:18:50] even in an organization
[1:18:52] but see he still got the problem
[1:18:55] sorry
[1:18:56] the problem though is that the horse
[1:18:58] rider unless he comes to the truth
[1:19:03] he's part of that system
[1:19:05] even being
[1:19:06] so sincere that he made his point well
[1:19:10] known
[1:19:11] he's still part of that system that's
[1:19:13] how close that thing is
[1:19:15] good people in those denominations
[1:19:17] brother branham i i
[1:19:19] he apologized many times but he never
[1:19:21] apologized
[1:19:23] for talking against that organization
[1:19:26] the system
[1:19:27] that's got them caught that cane
[1:19:30] system that is still riding today
[1:19:34] and you know what it's going to ride
[1:19:35] brothers and sisters until we take a
[1:19:37] body change
[1:19:38] because when we take a body change
[1:19:40] what's the fourth horse rider right
[1:19:42] death
[1:19:43] what's the last thing we got to have
[1:19:45] destroyed
[1:19:46] death
[1:19:47] that
[1:19:48] red
[1:19:50] pale or that red black that pale horse
[1:19:54] is what we got to defeat
[1:19:56] because there's your death
[1:19:59] death where's your sting
[1:20:02] grave where's your victory
[1:20:06] pale horse
[1:20:09] you need to ride in that direction
[1:20:11] because if not he's still riding in us
[1:20:14] right
[1:20:17] but death is going to be destroyed
[1:20:20] by a group of people
[1:20:22] that understands the two spirits
[1:20:24] and and you and i can never listen to me
[1:20:29] never separated
[1:20:32] we'll be deceived every time eve
[1:20:34] but remember he proclaimed that the
[1:20:37] second eve would not be deceived
[1:20:40] she will see the two spirits and
[1:20:43] separate the two spirits
[1:20:45] and know that one is antichrist and one
[1:20:47] is of christ
[1:20:49] thank god that that was pronounced on me
[1:20:51] and you
[1:20:52] because we have hope now not hope we
[1:20:53] have an assurity we have an assurity
[1:20:55] that somebody
[1:20:57] is going to come to that
[1:20:59] and those horse riders are going to go
[1:21:00] away you know what they're just going to
[1:21:02] stay down here
[1:21:04] the only thing that's leaving is the
[1:21:06] line oxman and the eagle the holy ghost
[1:21:07] is going to lift off the earth
[1:21:10] and then why horse red horse pale listen
[1:21:14] when that satan superman stands over
[1:21:16] there in the temple of god showing
[1:21:18] himself to be as god fulfilling the
[1:21:20] scripture
[1:21:21] he still thinks he's good
[1:21:24] and the world will bow to him
[1:21:27] why we worry about president you need to
[1:21:28] worry about that guy
[1:21:30] you need to worry about not being able
[1:21:31] to see him
[1:21:33] cause you missed something
[1:21:37] that's it
[1:21:38] you missed a raptor if you see that
[1:21:40] right that man
[1:21:42] and you well you know what that means
[1:21:43] you got caught up in that system
[1:21:48] that thing's still riding through you
[1:21:49] let's get rid of that
[1:21:52] let's don't worry we love natural
[1:21:54] healing but let's take the spiritual
[1:21:56] healing
[1:21:57] and let's let that spiritual healing
[1:21:59] just push everything out
[1:22:01] know that cain movement god sent us a
[1:22:03] prophet to show us that cain movement
[1:22:05] showed us where it was at
[1:22:08] and when the seals broke he said oh the
[1:22:10] bible became a brand new book why
[1:22:13] he saw
[1:22:14] that white horse rider all the way from
[1:22:16] cain
[1:22:17] then all the way down riding
[1:22:21] just like he was going to preach the
[1:22:22] trail of the serpent same thing that's
[1:22:24] the trail of the serpent it's a serpent
[1:22:25] seed in the beginning it's going to be
[1:22:26] serpents in the end
[1:22:29] through a beast system
[1:22:31] but it's going to head up in one person
[1:22:34] but you know what
[1:22:38] christ
[1:22:39] our head
[1:22:40] is going to head up in the body
[1:22:44] me and you
[1:22:46] the only body god has now on earth is me
[1:22:48] and you right now
[1:22:50] don't worry about anything that's going
[1:22:51] to happen god's already pronounced
[1:22:54] that you and i are going to make it lord
[1:22:57] doesn't matter
[1:23:00] she
[1:23:01] will not fall like eve fell
[1:23:05] that wasn't william branham talking
[1:23:07] folks that was god almighty speaking
[1:23:10] directly to me and you just like if the
[1:23:12] lord can speak to cain
[1:23:14] why can't he speak to me and you
[1:23:16] the capital l-o-r-d
[1:23:20] god bless you really sing song sorry of

[1:25:03] life's trouble seeing
[1:25:05] there i behold a haven prepared for me
[1:25:10] back to the garden of eden
[1:25:13] all god was he poured into christ all
[1:25:16] christ poured into the church
[1:25:18] taking us back
[1:25:20] into the presence of almighty god
[1:25:23] [Music]
[1:25:24] don't ever walk away from the presence
[1:25:26] of god
[1:25:27] [Music]
[1:25:31] amen
[1:25:34] don't ever walk away from god
[1:25:36] and he'll never drive you away either
[1:25:40] he says come unto me
[1:25:42] [Music]
[1:25:45] oh if
[1:25:46] if he'd have been standing in the garden
[1:25:48] abel would have still made the same
[1:25:49] choice but when he got down here on the
[1:25:52] earth and he said come unto me all you
[1:25:54] that are labored and heavy laden and
[1:25:57] i'll give you rest
[1:25:59] oh a group of people took that to heart
[1:26:03] they said oh lord we don't want to ever
[1:26:05] get away from your presence he said now
[1:26:06] i got to go away
[1:26:09] he said i got to go away he said but
[1:26:11] i'll come back the world won't see me no
[1:26:13] more but you'll see me
[1:26:14] for i'll be with you even in you to the
[1:26:16] end of the world in other words what i'm
[1:26:17] going to give you something to live by
[1:26:19] and all you got to do is believe what i
[1:26:21] said you can read about all these people
[1:26:23] in here you know well you can read about
[1:26:25] cain and abel and all these things but
[1:26:28] i've sealed the book
[1:26:31] until the end time
[1:26:33] and there's one group of people
[1:26:36] not 960 different denominations there's
[1:26:38] actually almost 13 000 different
[1:26:40] denominations now
[1:26:42] so
[1:26:43] there's only one god's going to speak to
[1:26:46] it's going to
[1:26:48] take christ
[1:26:51] and his word
[1:26:52] the rest will be deceived
[1:26:56] sorry the rest of this world is in a
[1:26:59] deception
[1:27:00] except for the bride of jesus christ
[1:27:03] because that's what he said
[1:27:04] he said for the elect's sake
[1:27:06] i'm going to cut this work short
[1:27:11] but look at it now
[1:27:13] all this unsettling in the world
[1:27:18] we're here
[1:27:21] is it gonna get better no probably not
[1:27:25] but like i said before
[1:27:27] don't sit around and say
[1:27:29] don't be like kane
[1:27:30] why are you doing this to me lord
[1:27:32] oh don't ever ask god that
[1:27:36] don't ever
[1:27:39] take if you're signing daughter of god
[1:27:42] it's got to be for your good
[1:27:46] god will not put anything on you
[1:27:48] that's not going to help you
[1:27:51] so if you go through a trial and a
[1:27:52] tribulation
[1:27:56] we really don't want to say lord pour it
[1:27:58] on but
[1:27:59] whatever it takes to get me in the right
[1:28:02] direction
[1:28:02] [Music]
[1:28:05] because we're sheep sheep have to be led
[1:28:09] the shepherd sometimes has to break a
[1:28:11] leg to keep the one little old sheep
[1:28:13] from jumping over the fence
[1:28:16] but you know what he's a good god he
[1:28:18] does it with nail scarred hands he does
[1:28:20] it with just like he did cain he came
[1:28:22] down to kane and personally said cain
[1:28:25] if you'll do well please
[1:28:28] but remember he couldn't
[1:28:30] override cain's free moral agency
[1:28:34] he couldn't override that
[1:28:36] but he did offer it to cain and cain
[1:28:38] said nope i'm going in that direction
[1:28:42] don't do that
[1:28:43] that is the worst death than just dying
[1:28:46] a natural death
[1:28:49] is to be alive
[1:28:51] but yet be dead
[1:28:54] the bible says she is dead
[1:28:56] while she liveth
[1:28:59] if you're not born again today you're a
[1:29:01] dead man or a dead woman walking
[1:29:04] sorry
[1:29:06] that's just the way it is
[1:29:08] get born again
[1:29:10] make sure
[1:29:11] that god is in your soul
[1:29:14] make sure
[1:29:15] that you know that you know that you
[1:29:18] know
[1:29:18] [Music]
[1:29:20] it's good to know that brother dale
[1:29:21] knows but that's secondhand information
[1:29:24] you need to know
[1:29:27] who you're serving today
[1:29:28] [Music]
[1:29:29] one way or the other you're serving
[1:29:32] but jesus told him he said you can't
[1:29:34] serve two at the same time you gotta
[1:29:36] serve one or the other amen so you
[1:29:39] decide which one let's bow our heads
[1:29:42] heavenly father we thank you lord for
