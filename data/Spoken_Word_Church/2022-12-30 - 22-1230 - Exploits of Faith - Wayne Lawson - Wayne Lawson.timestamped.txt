[34:51] amen so if we could tonight maybe we'd
[34:54] just bow our hearts in a word of Prayer

[34:58] Friday night and I wonder if you're

[35:02] you might just put your hand upon them
[35:04] and and you pray with them and ask God

[35:10] special event in the presence of God

[35:43] supernatural way speaking to the heart
[35:45] of your children father I pray your
[35:47] spirit would charge every believer here
[35:49] tonight to rise in another level of

[35:57] laid upon each other praying one for the
[35:59] other I pray the Holy Ghost would just

[36:04] anoint your people tonight may you break
[36:07] every spirit that would be unlike you I

[36:11] as we would speak to your children we
[36:13] ask the great witness that you would
[36:15] just come in the room and Lord you'd

[36:19] father if there be any sick among us I
[36:21] pray that you would heal them for it is

[36:32] room to be more than just our savior but
[36:35] Lord be our Lord tonight be the ruler of

[36:43] now we're asking these things in the
[36:45] mighty name of Jesus Christ we pray
[36:48] amen
[36:50] and amen and God bless you tonight if
[36:53] you have your Bibles with us uh yeah I
[36:56] would if you just turn in the scripture
[36:57] with me tonight to the Book of Daniel
[36:59] the 11th chapter amen whoever is on the
[37:02] sound give me more in my in my Monitor
[37:05] let me control the volume that way
[37:08] um it's about three quarters before I
[37:11] get the sound in my ear just turn that
[37:13] side up probably on the board of the
[37:16] auxiliary just turn that part up we want
[37:19] to look in Daniel 11
[37:21] and verse 32 Daniel 11 and 32.
[37:29] now this to me is a very powerful
[37:31] scripture but the Branham uses it a lot
[37:34] and he was he was very much
[37:37] placed this as an end time scripture so
[37:41] I want to just speak from it just for a
[37:43] moment tonight Daniel 11 and 32.
[37:47] and such do wickedly against the
[37:49] Covenant
[37:50] shall he corrupt by flatteries
[37:53] but the people and can you say that with
[37:56] me the people
[37:57] that do know their God shall be strong
[38:01] and do exploits
[38:04] so we're going to be looking at a couple
[38:05] things the people
[38:07] no God
[38:09] and do great exploits
[38:11] amen so we want to tonight to speak to
[38:14] you a little bit upon the exploits of
[38:17] Faith you could be seated if you'd like
[38:19] and we just want to take a few minutes
[38:21] in the scripture here and I I um I'm I'm
[38:24] I'm that guy when I read scripture I
[38:26] think who's that talking about
[38:28] I want to know what the scripture is
[38:31] talking about and who who is it and is
[38:34] it uh is it a certain group of people is
[38:37] it a you know who who would that be and
[38:40] when you read this scripture of the
[38:41] people of God you are you all know
[38:43] everyone's trying to get that position
[38:45] uh that we're the people you know
[38:47] everyone wants to be the people of God
[38:50] uh but you know when God wrote his word
[38:53] I don't believe God was just throwing
[38:55] that out there uh that whoever wanted to
[38:58] be that but I believe God had something
[39:00] in mind I I think that God has he's an
[39:04] all-knowing God so God has something in
[39:07] mind when he writes something and when
[39:09] he says the people that do know their
[39:11] God shall be strong and do exploits I
[39:15] believe that it's I believe that it's
[39:16] speaking of a prophecy concerning a
[39:19] people uh the same book you read the
[39:22] book of Daniel and you read the 12th
[39:24] chapter of the Book of Daniel and it's
[39:25] it's a tremendous reading but it's also
[39:27] in the second and third chapters of
[39:29] Daniel that you'll find the the entire
[39:31] world events are prophesied through
[39:34] Daniel when he comes to Nebuchadnezzar's
[39:36] dream and then in Daniel 7 he has his
[39:38] own visions and he he tells you in the
[39:40] Book of Daniel who will be in
[39:41] controlling the world throughout the
[39:43] entire Gentile kingdoms so the Book of
[39:45] Daniel is a prophetic book of course
[39:47] it's an Old Testament book of
[39:48] Revelations right and so it's a it's a
[39:51] powerful book and uh and what's
[39:53] beautiful is to see that our name is
[39:56] actually in the book now the prophet
[39:58] tells us that when the seals are opened
[40:00] that what it will do is it will call our
[40:03] names by the revealing of that mystery
[40:05] and that's what I think is powerful is
[40:08] that you when you're able to hear it
[40:10] that it that it speaks to you now the
[40:12] people of course uh this would be
[40:14] another prophecy of this same of this
[40:17] same type comes in the book of Hosea
[40:18] when Hosea is spoke to by God uh here it
[40:23] says yet the number of the children of
[40:24] Israel shall be is the sand of the sea
[40:27] which cannot be measured or no burden
[40:29] she'll come to pass that in the place
[40:31] where it is said unto them ye are not my
[40:34] people there it shall be said unto them
[40:36] ye are the sons of the Living God now
[40:39] you know that prophecy concerning of
[40:41] course when it says you are not my
[40:43] people but there so shall be said unto
[40:45] them you are the sons of the Living God
[40:47] now if that's just speaking to the Jews
[40:49] it would say you are the Servants of the
[40:51] Living God but being that it says that
[40:53] you are the sons of the Living God now
[40:55] we know it's dealing with the Gentile
[40:57] because Israel is servants and Gentiles
[41:00] or Sons so when he starts dealing with
[41:02] the sons then there's a hosea's prophecy
[41:05] speaking of this when they wasn't a
[41:07] people of course this is Abraham's seed
[41:09] right there there was no seed at all but
[41:11] he said thy seed shall be as the stars
[41:13] and the sand so it's a prophecy of a
[41:16] people coming when there was nothing
[41:18] there will be this great people coming
[41:20] in First Peter chapter 2 and 9 Peter
[41:22] describes the same people from The Book
[41:25] of Daniel 11 also in the book of Hosea
[41:27] and he's speaking talking of the Hosea
[41:29] prophecy when he says but you are a
[41:31] chosen generation you are a royal
[41:34] priesthood of course that's a king
[41:36] priesthood right royal priesthood Kings
[41:39] and Priests and a holy nation It's A
[41:41] peculiar people that you should show
[41:43] forth the Praises of him who hath called
[41:46] you out of Darkness into Marvelous Light
[41:48] now which in times past you were not a
[41:51] people but now are the people of God and
[41:55] have that which had not obtained Mercy
[41:57] but now you have obtained Mercy amen
[42:01] isn't it powerful that Apostle Peter is
[42:03] now taking that from the book of Hosea
[42:06] and he's identifying it into the Gentile
[42:08] church so what I'll say it was talking
[42:10] about is you Gentiles in Romans chapter
[42:13] 9 Paul will speak of the same prophecy
[42:15] Romans 9 23. he said he might mating on
[42:18] the riches of his glory on the vessels
[42:21] of Mercy which he had prepared unto
[42:23] Glory even us whom he hath called not of
[42:27] the Jew only but also of the Gentiles as
[42:31] he saith in Hosea of course that's the
[42:33] book of Hosea I will call them my people
[42:35] which were not my people and her beloved
[42:37] which was not beloved and it shall come
[42:40] to pass in that place where it is said
[42:42] unto them you're not my people they
[42:44] shall be called the children of the
[42:46] Living God so it's speaking of the
[42:49] Gentiles So when you say the people
[42:51] shall know their God now we realize that
[42:54] it's including the Gentile church but
[42:56] the Gentile church is a big church and
[42:58] there's a lot of people that's called
[43:00] into that but it starts narrowing down
[43:02] when you go into the scripture Into the
[43:04] Book of Revelations the 18th chapter and
[43:07] I heard another voice from Heaven saying
[43:10] come out of her my people and be not
[43:13] partakers of her sins that you receive
[43:15] not her plagues now we're seeing that
[43:17] that people in Daniel 11 is now in the
[43:20] Book of Revelations the 18th chapter and
[43:23] the fourth verse and I I wonder who them
[43:25] people are amen that heard that voice to
[43:27] come out of Babylon amen that is the
[43:30] people the Gentile bride that is called
[43:33] out by the message of the hour remember
[43:35] brother random went beyond the curtain
[43:36] of time that that was one of the great
[43:38] Revelations he's seen those Millions
[43:40] coming to him and he said are these all
[43:42] branhams he said oh no these are your
[43:44] converts amen these are the people that
[43:47] scripture talked about that would come
[43:49] at the end time and they actually said
[43:51] to brother Branham had you not come we
[43:53] would not be here amen because he had to
[43:56] make that great decision in love divine
[43:58] remember he he had to make that great
[44:00] decision to stay with the word to open
[44:02] the word and because he did that there's
[44:05] a people amen that made the other side
[44:07] that had their robes washed and the
[44:10] pardoning grace of the word
[44:12] so I believe that that we would be those
[44:14] people can you see your name there in
[44:16] Daniel 11. Amen the people that know
[44:18] their God that's speaking of you you
[44:21] somebody said are we actually in the
[44:23] Bible of course you're in the Bible in
[44:25] Daniel 11 he's not just talking about
[44:27] any people he's talking about gentile
[44:29] people he's talking about the people
[44:32] called out under this message amen now
[44:34] Ephesians chapter 1 Paul would actually
[44:37] say in the 17th verse he says that this
[44:40] this should increase us this should give
[44:42] us something in Ephesians 1 he said the
[44:44] Lord a God uh the the god of our Lord
[44:47] Jesus Christ the father of Glory may he
[44:50] give unto you the spirit of wisdom and
[44:52] Revelation in the knowledge of him that
[44:54] the eyes of your understanding being
[44:56] enlightened that you may know what is
[44:58] the hope of it calling and what is the
[45:00] riches of the glory of the inheritance
[45:03] and Saints I tell you it's a powerful
[45:05] thing what Paul is saying here you hear
[45:07] Brother random say he pray for
[45:09] Revelation more than you pray for
[45:10] anything else now brother man was script
[45:12] scriptural because here Paul is saying
[45:14] to the church pray for understanding you
[45:17] see that's this is what job was talking
[45:19] about in job the 42nd chapter when he
[45:22] was asking God you remember God asked
[45:24] him where were you that he turns around
[45:25] and then he begins to ask God Amen in
[45:27] other words if this knowledge is
[45:29] accessible if this knowledge exists then
[45:31] I'm Desiring I'm thirsting to understand
[45:34] because God has said I can't understand
[45:36] that I'm not I'm not no longer satisfied
[45:39] but just a good sermon that or a good
[45:41] little Baptist Bible story that someone
[45:43] has to tell but the Bible said there
[45:46] would be a people that would know their
[45:48] God then this this knowledge is
[45:50] available then then God has intended for
[45:53] somebody to know him listen friends this
[45:56] is not just you wanting to know God he
[45:58] intends for you to know him and he
[46:01] desires to be known of you you know you
[46:03] know that great mystery Christ of
[46:05] history of God revealed beautiful book
[46:07] brother man brings open the purpose of
[46:09] God he said one of the great purposes of
[46:11] God the Great the great sole purpose the
[46:14] number one purpose was that God wanted
[46:16] to be made known Adam knew him Adam
[46:19] heard him say Adam talked with him Adam
[46:22] had the Angels but Adam did not know him
[46:25] in a way that satisfied God to be known
[46:27] but God let Adam fall from the Garden of
[46:30] Eden in Perfection he let him fall out
[46:33] of that Perfection to come into this
[46:35] time space that the revelation of who
[46:38] and what God is would be given back to
[46:40] man and then God picks man back up and
[46:43] brings him back into an eating condition
[46:45] but you have bypassed where Adam was
[46:47] standing in the beginning you don't know
[46:49] God like Adam you know God beyond what
[46:52] Adam knew amen it's not just that God
[46:54] says that you'll he loves you you
[46:56] understand the love of God you're
[46:58] understanding the grace of God you're
[47:00] understanding the power of redemption if
[47:03] anybody knows what it means to be saved
[47:05] I know what it means to be saved if
[47:08] anybody knows what it means to be the
[47:10] lost and undone I know what it means to
[47:13] be lost and undone and if God had not
[47:15] intended me to have that knowledge I
[47:17] would never have that knowledge amen but
[47:19] it wasn't that God wanted us to fall he
[47:21] wanted us to know he's a savior it
[47:24] wasn't that God wants someone to be sick
[47:26] he wants you to know that he's a Healer
[47:28] do you know the Bible said in John 14
[47:30] that in that day they shall know that I
[47:34] am of the Father the father me and I in
[47:36] you there is a direct prophecy of Jesus
[47:38] his own words that you would know in
[47:40] this name some people said well you
[47:42] can't know you're born again but Jesus
[47:44] said you could and Jesus said there
[47:46] would come a day that you would know and
[47:48] you said how would I know brother random
[47:50] says it like this John 14 and 20. he
[47:53] said I'll tell you what will happen
[47:54] right there he says God Elohim will
[47:57] become material in the Church of the
[47:59] Living God Amen just as God was in
[48:02] Christ Christ is in the church
[48:04] manifesting himself in the power of his
[48:07] word and his Revelation you see Paul is
[48:10] saying that we praise that the wisdom
[48:12] and Revelation and the knowledge of him
[48:14] would do something it would Open the
[48:16] Eyes of our understanding and we would
[48:19] be enlightened or illuminated with the
[48:21] word of God what if the word begin to
[48:23] really illuminate you what if
[48:25] illumination really struck you then it
[48:27] would give you understanding of God it
[48:29] would give you understanding of yourself
[48:31] it would give you understanding of who
[48:33] you are and brother there is power in
[48:35] understanding it positionally knowledges
[48:38] amen positionally places the church in
[48:41] maturity and the knowledge Ephesians
[48:43] chapter one of course the eyes of our
[48:46] understanding being and I like Ephesians
[48:48] 1 It's A Beautiful chapter but just
[48:50] after he says your eyes are open do you
[48:52] know what the next verse is sold it
[48:54] holds the exceeding power and the
[48:55] greatness of God which was exhibited in
[48:57] the resurrection of our Lord Jesus
[48:59] Christ when he was raised up to sit at
[49:01] the right hand of the father and all
[49:03] things were put under his feet now
[49:06] that's where the prophet of God began to
[49:07] put the church in power remember if
[49:10] you're reading Ephesians 1 you're
[49:11] reading Revelations 3 and you're reading
[49:14] and allowed to see an age somebody would
[49:16] overcome laodicea and they would have
[49:18] their eyes opened and they would share
[49:21] in the Throne of almighty god listen if
[49:23] you ever catch the revelation of this
[49:25] message and the spirit of wisdom and
[49:28] Revelation it will put you over your
[49:29] enemy it will put you over the devil it
[49:32] will place you over whatever birth
[49:34] you've had whatever troubles you've had
[49:36] whatever's coming to your life your
[49:38] knowledge of God will exalt you to the
[49:41] right hand of almighty God I'll tell you
[49:43] what friend it's a powerful thing to
[49:45] know that we have not set ourselves here
[49:47] but before we came here God intended for
[49:50] us to sit in this seat and we have been
[49:52] anointed for this time and this
[49:54] generation the eyes of understanding
[49:56] Illuminating the church to knowledge and
[49:59] wisdom and if you're going to see
[50:01] something what you ought to see you
[50:02] ought to see the presence of God you are
[50:04] to see the power of God you want to
[50:06] receive the reality you say how can I
[50:08] see him brother Wayne brother random
[50:10] said to recognize the presence of God is
[50:12] to see promised word manifested and
[50:15] you'll know you're in his presence that
[50:17] is his proof of manifestation of the
[50:20] resurrection of Jesus Christ and listen
[50:22] friends this Bible said we ought to know
[50:24] him and we ought to pray to know him we
[50:27] ought to know him in the power of
[50:28] Resurrection according to Ephesians
[50:30] chapter one I'm just thinking of this
[50:32] that the Bible is telling us that if we
[50:35] would know the Lord that we would
[50:37] increase an understanding and the
[50:39] vastness so Holy Ghost boldness would be
[50:41] released in the church by that knowledge
[50:44] see the knowledge of God is more than
[50:47] just a book understanding the knowledge
[50:49] of God is knowing that if God said it
[50:51] God can do it
[50:53] the god that we serve created the
[50:55] heavens and the Earth and if he said you
[50:57] can take the land I promise you can take
[50:59] the lamb if God said the Wall fall the
[51:01] wall will fall amen if you know God you
[51:04] know that you can just listen to his
[51:06] word and there's a God there that can
[51:09] manifest his word no matter the
[51:10] situation so Holy Ghost boldness begins
[51:13] to be released in you you begin to
[51:15] believe for impossible things you
[51:18] believe that things that were completely
[51:20] impossible has become possible isn't
[51:23] that powerful someone that really knows
[51:25] God they know this is impossible but
[51:28] it's possible because there's a God Amen
[51:31] it's not that we're trying to act like
[51:33] things are not there that are or we're
[51:35] not trying to act like things that ain't
[51:38] there are going to be there but
[51:39] confession like Abraham said the things
[51:42] that are not
[51:43] they are in the things that are they are
[51:45] not because everything has to come into
[51:48] the word of God we're going to move from
[51:50] glory to glory friends we're going to
[51:52] see the mighty exploits of God we're
[51:54] going to know him beyond the current
[51:56] measure of our knowing the limitations
[51:59] begin to come off you you if you if you
[52:01] are of limited God you have limited to
[52:03] the believer if you've limited God you
[52:06] have limited to the believer if you have
[52:08] limited your God you can go no higher
[52:11] than the gods you know but when God
[52:13] wanted to be introduced to this
[52:15] generation he sent Malachi for he did
[52:18] not send an educated man he sent a
[52:21] humble man that let God in the pillar of
[52:23] fire and came back and told this church
[52:25] he's a living Lord Jesus and he's every
[52:28] bit of his word is still the truth you
[52:31] know what matters who introduces a man
[52:32] don't you it matters who introduces you
[52:35] you know I used I got a good friend
[52:37] brother Matt McLaren he's a world he's
[52:39] actually a world champion pistol shot
[52:40] 1991 he won the world shoot I mean the
[52:42] word World chewed and when I first knew
[52:45] him I knew he was Sean and Jonathan
[52:46] Martin's brother-in-law amen nice guy
[52:49] sitting there kind of quiet and one day
[52:51] somebody said well you know brother Matt
[52:52] here he he won and I get to looking the
[52:54] guy up and he's he's known all over the
[52:56] world I've been having coffee with him
[52:58] for days I have no clue who this guy is
[53:00] and somebody finally introduces me and
[53:03] and you know what I found out amen he
[53:05] had another level to him that I wasn't
[53:07] getting it all but he was he was
[53:09] somebody I was sitting in the presence
[53:11] with a very famous man didn't have no
[53:13] clue who he was and you know there's
[53:15] people in this generation that does not
[53:17] know that Jesus Christ is alive they
[53:19] don't know him more than just a church
[53:22] ethic or some social Gathering they
[53:24] don't know him more than just somebody
[53:26] they've read about or something is
[53:28] looked but there is a way in this
[53:30] generation that we have been introduced
[53:32] to the god of the Bible the same Lord
[53:36] Jesus William Branham introduced us to
[53:38] the same Lord Jesus not a Jesus of
[53:41] yesterday not of Jesus yourself tomorrow
[53:43] but the Jesus of today the same Jesus
[53:47] that was in the Bible has been
[53:49] introduced in this generation and you
[53:51] can know him and you can meet him in the
[53:54] power of his resurrection now brother
[53:56] Branham in the Paradox in 64 he said
[53:59] this I want to know him and to know him
[54:01] is to have life I don't want to be a
[54:03] smart man I want to know him
[54:05] he said Paul said I want to know him and
[54:08] the power of his resurrection isn't
[54:10] amazing somebody one time can you
[54:12] imagine arguing scripture with brother
[54:14] Branham and they said brother Brandon
[54:16] problem you is you just don't know your
[54:17] Bible very well he said yes but I know
[54:20] the author very good amen and I tell you
[54:23] if you're going to know one or the other
[54:24] wouldn't you want to know the author of
[54:26] The Bible amen if you know the author of
[54:29] The Bible you've got life to know the
[54:32] word without the author the Bible said
[54:34] the letter killeth but the spirit giveth
[54:37] life amen you can take this word and
[54:40] kill people you could and the Bible
[54:41] talks about people that are twice dead
[54:43] and plucked up you know what I figured
[54:45] out that is that's people that are dead
[54:47] and religion has killed them dead dead
[54:49] you know amen they were dead if People's
[54:51] dead in the world at least they got hope
[54:52] there's Grace or there's something to
[54:54] save them or something to help them but
[54:56] if they get religion they get dead dead
[54:58] you know they get embalmed with
[55:00] embalming fluid of that there's no hope
[55:02] for tomorrow there's no way to change
[55:04] there's nothing that can happen but
[55:06] William Branham did not introduce that
[55:08] kind of God to us he did not introduce
[55:10] us to a God just of the letter but he
[55:12] introduced us to the god of creation and
[55:15] anointing and power that was able to
[55:17] change lives I I want to know him but I
[55:20] want to know him by his word brother
[55:21] Adam said but see the thing is to know
[55:24] him by this word that's all right but
[55:26] it's a long ways from being sufficient
[55:29] to know him by the word we've got to
[55:31] know him by the person of his
[55:33] resurrection let me ask you who knew him
[55:36] better by the word than Paul did
[55:39] but Paul knew the word so well he was
[55:42] fighting the resurrected Jesus and
[55:44] didn't even know it
[55:46] his Zeal was fighting the anointing by
[55:49] the written word but one day he met him
[55:52] in the person and when he met him his
[55:54] life was changed amen God Amen God come
[55:57] to him and changed his life and then
[56:00] Paul said I have known him amen he was
[56:03] seen of them but last of all he was seen
[56:05] of me and Paul didn't see him in the in
[56:08] the human body in his resurrection he
[56:10] saw him in the pillar of fire I'm on
[56:12] church amen do you know you've met him
[56:14] like Paul met him we met him like Paul
[56:17] met him in this generation at Gentile
[56:19] churches to meet him in the pillar of
[56:21] fire you don't know the pillar of fire
[56:23] is still here amen the pillar of fire
[56:25] always accompanies the message of the
[56:28] hour amen our God is not dead he's not
[56:31] somewhere in a tomb somebody said how do
[56:33] you think the pillar fires Jesus well
[56:34] Paul met him he said Lord who are you he
[56:37] said I'm Jesus and brother man said now
[56:39] we now have amen the photograph I don't
[56:42] know where it's at now but we now have
[56:44] the photograph amen of the supernatural
[56:46] Angel of the Lord over William branham's
[56:49] head of course it was the same Lord
[56:51] Jesus the Same Lord Jesus because he
[56:54] wants to be made known now the prophet
[56:56] of God and you must be born again said
[56:58] the true word comes to a true prophet
[57:01] and he tells you the true word and you
[57:04] follow the true word and you get a true
[57:06] experience of the word because the word
[57:09] is made flesh in you and you become
[57:13] God's son and the word of God is
[57:16] revolving right out of you God into you
[57:19] because you are his nature his spirit is
[57:22] in you and you'll do the works of God
[57:24] the Bible said so isn't that something
[57:27] now A True Believer does not have to
[57:30] work up being a Believer he's just a
[57:32] believer amen they don't have to work
[57:35] themselves into it they don't have to
[57:36] beat themselves into it they're just
[57:38] Believers that's what they are they just
[57:41] believe and and the things of God the
[57:44] works of God follow the Believers of God
[57:47] now you know the scriptures is telling
[57:50] us then there is an experience with God
[57:52] now it's a powerful thing because really
[57:55] if you've ever experienced God it's not
[57:57] just a one and done right amen people
[58:00] say to me uh brother Wayne tell us about
[58:02] your experience I say which one amen
[58:04] because I did have one and then I had
[58:06] another one and then I had another one
[58:08] and I just had a couple on the way down
[58:10] here to preach these meetings so so my
[58:13] experience with God has never stopped
[58:15] and listen friend if your experience
[58:16] with the Lord is quit amen it's time to
[58:19] reacquaint yourself with a resurrected
[58:21] Lord Jesus amen to bring him in your car
[58:24] bring him in your home bring him in your
[58:27] life he is alive and wants to fellowship
[58:30] with his church amen now now the prophet
[58:34] will say something in the message Feast
[58:36] of the trumpets years ago I remember
[58:37] somebody's telling me stay away from
[58:39] this sermon that it would confuse me
[58:41] well you know what I always found that
[58:44] the real good stuff is under the
[58:45] Scarecrow
[58:47] amen the real good fruits where they
[58:49] tell you stay away from that that's
[58:50] first place I want to go so what what
[58:53] are they trying to keep me out of you
[58:54] know but uh in the Feast of the trumpets
[58:56] brother Bradham actually brother Brown
[58:58] says something that's so powerful it's a
[59:00] powerful sermon altogether but here in
[59:03] one of them he says this now of course
[59:05] we're in the Book of Daniel right and
[59:07] brother man was talking about the
[59:08] Messiah and he said now the people
[59:10] that's believing him how will they know
[59:13] it unless they're constantly in the word
[59:16] see see to know what he is see the wise
[59:21] shall know but the foolish and unwise
[59:25] wouldn't know him now you know where
[59:27] he's at he's in Daniel 12 now he said
[59:29] the wise shall know but the foolish and
[59:31] unwise wouldn't know they shall know
[59:34] their God look at this now he's in
[59:36] Daniel 11. they shall know their God now
[59:39] he shall appear in the last days to
[59:42] bring the people back to the word so the
[59:46] bride will know her husband know her
[59:49] mate the revealed word that's why this
[59:52] has to happen that's why there has to be
[59:55] a messenger that's why there has to be a
[59:57] prophet and I don't have time to preach
[59:59] on Feast of trumpets tonight but let's
[1:00:01] let's get real quickly let's say this
[1:00:03] Feast of trumpets to Israel was the
[1:00:06] trumpet sounding under Eichmann and
[1:00:08] Hitler persecution putting Israel back
[1:00:10] in its Homeland right the Feast of
[1:00:13] trumpets to the bride was the opening of
[1:00:15] Seven Seals the that calls the bride
[1:00:17] back to their Homeland what the trumpets
[1:00:20] done for Israel the seals done for the
[1:00:22] bride it calls them into their for
[1:00:25] ordained position that God had in this
[1:00:28] mind concerning the church so the
[1:00:30] prophet is telling us this message has
[1:00:32] to sound so the bride will know her
[1:00:34] husband now there's a lot of people
[1:00:36] thinks that when Jesus returns that
[1:00:38] they're going to go meet him and then
[1:00:39] they're going to go meet their husbands
[1:00:41] and they think like this but the image
[1:00:43] they have of Jesus is so different than
[1:00:45] the word image that they've already
[1:00:47] missed him and don't even know it amen
[1:00:50] but but the prophet is saying he will
[1:00:52] appear in the last days to bring the
[1:00:54] people back to the word so that they the
[1:00:57] bride will know her husband know her
[1:01:00] mate do you know your mate is the
[1:01:02] revealed word of the hour
[1:01:04] and the husband of the church is the
[1:01:08] message of the hour it's the word that's
[1:01:11] been revealed that's why it's a headship
[1:01:13] that's why it's a Capstone message it's
[1:01:16] because it's the headship it's the it's
[1:01:18] the one that we're married to this new
[1:01:20] anointed word we have married to this
[1:01:23] anointed word and the bride shall know
[1:01:25] her mate amen now I want to re-read that
[1:01:28] Daniel 11 and watch what it says there
[1:01:30] in Daniel 11. he says it very clearly he
[1:01:33] says that the the the the the the the
[1:01:35] people of God shall be strong and do
[1:01:38] great exploits right the people shall be
[1:01:40] strong and do great exploits brother
[1:01:43] random is re-saying that for you I love
[1:01:45] how he does it sometimes he's not adding
[1:01:47] or taking he's resaying the scripture so
[1:01:49] you can catch it listen to him he said
[1:01:52] they shall know their God now when he's
[1:01:54] in Daniel 11 32 they shall know their
[1:01:56] God he shall appear in the last days to
[1:01:59] bring the people back to the word there
[1:02:01] it is the people shall know their God
[1:02:03] now look at this next thing he says here
[1:02:05] the bride will know her husband
[1:02:09] the people now in his word is the bride
[1:02:13] amen the people shall know their God the
[1:02:17] word God now brother random has changed
[1:02:19] for husband
[1:02:20] the people shall know their God is the
[1:02:22] bride will know her husband the revealed
[1:02:25] word of the hour that is the maid of the
[1:02:28] church if they ever know him they will
[1:02:30] go in strength they will get powerful
[1:02:33] people they will they will get a
[1:02:35] strength from him because they know the
[1:02:38] god of the Bible is the god that has
[1:02:42] promised to become the husband of the
[1:02:44] church in the end time that's why this
[1:02:47] has to happen so the bride will know her
[1:02:50] husband know her how many knows him
[1:02:52] tonight
[1:02:53] how many knows him tonight now of course
[1:02:55] Daniel was speaking of the end time in
[1:02:58] Daniel chapter 12. and you you can look
[1:03:00] and see it in the ninth verse the Bible
[1:03:02] said the words are closed and sealed to
[1:03:03] the time of the end and many shall be
[1:03:05] purified and made wide and tried but the
[1:03:07] wicked shall do wickedly boy that's true
[1:03:09] huh
[1:03:10] the wicked shall do wickedly anybody got
[1:03:13] any doubt that they're doing it the
[1:03:15] wicked shall do wickedly they are doing
[1:03:17] their job perfectly and none of the
[1:03:20] wicked shall understand isn't that
[1:03:22] something and they shall not understand
[1:03:24] but the wise shall understand so now the
[1:03:28] people of Daniel 11 is the wise of
[1:03:30] Daniel 12 is the wise version of Matthew
[1:03:33] 25 and she's the wise man of Ephesians
[1:03:37] chapter five what are we talking about
[1:03:38] we're talking about the same people
[1:03:40] described many different ways in the
[1:03:43] Bible you're not just in one place in
[1:03:45] scripture you're all over the Bible
[1:03:47] because you're a part of the word that
[1:03:50] is to manifest in the end time do you
[1:03:52] see the wise shall understand now if
[1:03:54] you're a Bible student you know that
[1:03:56] Revelations 22 speaks of the moment that
[1:03:59] he meets the angel he wants to worship
[1:04:01] that John says he heard him say unseal
[1:04:03] the book right Daniel over there in
[1:04:06] Daniel he said he'll seal it up to the
[1:04:07] end and then the wife shall understand
[1:04:09] Revelations 10 says until it up to the
[1:04:11] seventh angel and revelation 22 said an
[1:04:14] angel came to him and said it's time to
[1:04:15] unseal the book well amen that's pretty
[1:04:18] clear isn't it unseal the book but then
[1:04:20] it said the wicked shall the righteous
[1:04:21] shall be righteous and the unrighteous
[1:04:24] shall be your unrighteous steal but the
[1:04:26] wise shall understand so there's a
[1:04:28] spirit of wisdom released with the
[1:04:30] opening of the word of God it's not just
[1:04:33] that God opened the word he released the
[1:04:35] spirit of wisdom upon the church that
[1:04:38] they might see and identify that this is
[1:04:40] God my when I think about this he said
[1:04:43] the wise shall understand Ephesians
[1:04:46] chapter 5 we're forced he saith awaken
[1:04:49] thou that sleepest and to rise from the
[1:04:52] dead and Christ shall give thee light
[1:04:55] see them that you want circumspectly not
[1:04:58] as fools but as wise now look at the
[1:05:01] beauty of this Redeeming the time
[1:05:03] because the days are evil now watch what
[1:05:06] Paul says wherefore be ye not unwise you
[1:05:09] hear Brother Branham talk about this a
[1:05:11] lot of times he says don't don't be
[1:05:13] unwise don't be the unwise Virgin amen
[1:05:16] now the foolish version is in Matthew 25
[1:05:19] but the unwise is in Ephesians 5 and
[1:05:23] he's saying but be and not unwise but an
[1:05:25] understanding know what the will of the
[1:05:28] Lord is now in the message of adoption
[1:05:31] brother Adam will tell us this he said
[1:05:33] the other day I took this word in
[1:05:34] Mystery in scripture and it began to
[1:05:36] pack me back in the Old Testament then
[1:05:38] put me over in the New Testament and
[1:05:40] tied something together see the mystery
[1:05:42] of his coming
[1:05:44] three things the mystery of his coming
[1:05:46] the mystery of his will and the Mystery
[1:05:48] of us setting together there's three
[1:05:50] things you're catching you're going to
[1:05:52] catch the mystery of his coming the
[1:05:53] mystery of his wheel and the Mystery of
[1:05:56] us setting together he said by the way
[1:05:57] all that's in the message absolutely
[1:05:59] absolutely it's in the midst do you you
[1:06:02] see the great mystery of his coming
[1:06:04] that's released under this message it's
[1:06:07] not the coming for the Millennium it's
[1:06:09] the coming for the carrying away of the
[1:06:11] church so the church has got to be
[1:06:13] caught up in the mystery of the hour
[1:06:15] which is the seventh seal it's the
[1:06:17] mystery ever going it's the mystery of
[1:06:19] rapture and the Mystery of body change
[1:06:21] but to catch it you got to catch the
[1:06:23] mystery of his coming you say the
[1:06:25] mystery of his coming yes it's Elohim
[1:06:28] see the mystery of Elohim is what has
[1:06:31] been given to this Joshua generation
[1:06:34] you say hello him yes that's what come
[1:06:36] to Abraham remember when Elohim took a
[1:06:39] body and spoke to Abraham as the word
[1:06:41] and discerned their hearts and he's
[1:06:43] called his name Lord Brother Brown said
[1:06:45] was he Lord he said Abraham called him
[1:06:47] God he said then he proved he was God
[1:06:49] when he said where's Sarah thy wife and
[1:06:52] Abraham said she's in the tent behind me
[1:06:54] he said see there's the proof that he
[1:06:57] was talking to the Lord the word is a
[1:06:59] discerner of the thought until the heart
[1:07:01] why did he discern there why was the
[1:07:03] discernment there brother Brown said was
[1:07:04] building a sign so he built the sign in
[1:07:07] the days of Abraham Jesus read the book
[1:07:10] of Genesis and said as it was in the
[1:07:12] days of lot so shall it be in the coming
[1:07:16] of the son of man then Elohim has been
[1:07:19] predicted to return in the last days and
[1:07:22] the Mystery of Elohim has shown us that
[1:07:24] God himself would take human bodies in
[1:07:27] the end time and we've seen the proof of
[1:07:29] it there's over 8 300 times on tape
[1:07:32] where William Branham discerned the
[1:07:34] thought he told the need he gained my
[1:07:37] vision exactly what was done in the Book
[1:07:39] of Genesis and never one time did
[1:07:41] anybody say brother Branham that's wrong
[1:07:43] and every time they said it was true
[1:07:45] because it was the spirit of truth that
[1:07:48] was bringing the Revelation to the
[1:07:50] church that is Jesus that's here it
[1:07:52] wasn't the man William ran him he took a
[1:07:54] temporary resurrection and God used his
[1:07:57] body to bring that revelation of the
[1:08:00] coming of the Lord to the church it was
[1:08:02] Elohim that was coming what does this
[1:08:04] mean Elohim is back in the flesh
[1:08:08] come on church and this ain't just God
[1:08:11] with us this ain't now I'm saying God
[1:08:14] With Us come on this is Matthew the 28th
[1:08:16] chapter I'll be with you even in you
[1:08:19] until the end of the ages John 14
[1:08:21] because highly of ye live also and in
[1:08:24] that day you shall know that I am and
[1:08:26] the Father the father of me and I and
[1:08:28] you my goodness what a resurrection that
[1:08:31] was and what a resurrection this is he's
[1:08:33] alive and you're alive and the Elohim
[1:08:36] coming is showing us the same God he's
[1:08:40] just changing masks
[1:08:42] hey man you're the generation that knows
[1:08:44] he's not three Gods he's one God but he
[1:08:46] said God with the same nature he just
[1:08:49] changes his mask and in the last days he
[1:08:52] promised to appear to us in the form of
[1:08:55] the Bride of Jesus Christ come on church
[1:08:58] for you that look for his appearing the
[1:09:00] second time you shall see it with sin
[1:09:03] without sin under salvation if you knew
[1:09:05] what you're looking at as he said to the
[1:09:07] woman at the well if you knew you was
[1:09:09] talking to you would ask for me if if
[1:09:12] you have identified what this word is
[1:09:14] you would say God fill me with it
[1:09:16] tonight fill me with your quickening
[1:09:18] power the Living God Has Come Among Us
[1:09:21] the god of the Bible has awoken and
[1:09:24] arose and walked into the Church of the
[1:09:26] Living God and I say arise and awake
[1:09:29] awaken yourself from the sleep of this
[1:09:32] laodicea and notify yourself that Elohim
[1:09:36] has returned among us to make known the
[1:09:39] mystery of his will
[1:09:41] Ephesians said he would do it it's
[1:09:43] adoption
[1:09:44] that he would make known the mystery of
[1:09:46] his will that's exactly what he told
[1:09:48] Abraham the will of God concerning his
[1:09:50] life the will of God concerning the body
[1:09:52] change and the prophet of God said of
[1:09:54] course
[1:09:55] of course you'll not have the will of
[1:09:57] God without his word
[1:09:59] you've got to have Elohim coming to have
[1:10:02] Elohim restore the word so you can know
[1:10:05] the will of God and brother Graham said
[1:10:06] that third revelation of that he said
[1:10:08] would be the mystery of us sitting
[1:10:10] together so Ephesians 1 lets us see
[1:10:12] we're setting with him in Heavenly
[1:10:14] places and listen that's not a
[1:10:16] church-aged message friends that's not
[1:10:19] just through every message to every age
[1:10:21] Matthew 20 says it wasn't they asked
[1:10:24] Jesus to set it in the right and left
[1:10:26] hand he said I can't give it to you
[1:10:27] because God's already given it to a
[1:10:29] certain group of people that would be
[1:10:31] coming in the end time mother Brown said
[1:10:33] to be granted to that word bride in that
[1:10:36] last day the Overcomer of laodicea I'm
[1:10:39] talking about somebody setting with the
[1:10:40] Throne of God with dominion and power
[1:10:43] with adoption upon their hearts and upon
[1:10:46] their life this message ain't just a
[1:10:48] watered down theological idea it's the
[1:10:51] power of God that's coming the church to
[1:10:53] anoint us and identify us for the
[1:10:56] rapturing of the church it's the
[1:10:58] Vindication that we're setting with him
[1:11:00] we're setting that you you could get
[1:11:02] pretty Evangelical here hey man you
[1:11:04] could get there if you wanted to but
[1:11:06] we'll set him with him in the countdown
[1:11:07] right we're setting with him in the
[1:11:10] countdown ready for takeoff that's where
[1:11:13] the church is she sealed away in there
[1:11:15] you say where's this going to happen
[1:11:16] I'll tell you what he's here and he's
[1:11:18] with the church and he's in the church
[1:11:20] he's not just here he tabernacled in the
[1:11:23] church and the Bible says that prophecy
[1:11:25] after prophecy brother Madam said it'll
[1:11:27] happen in the same time that the stone
[1:11:30] is going to Smite the image of Babylon
[1:11:33] and we have seen the rock shoot out of
[1:11:35] the mountain we have seen the great
[1:11:37] Capstone revelation of the word smash
[1:11:40] against the nomination and the people
[1:11:42] that see that will be people that are
[1:11:45] wise and they shall know their God and
[1:11:47] become strong my the strength this
[1:11:51] message ought to give you the overcoming
[1:11:53] strength the anointing to rise above
[1:11:56] every denominational Creed above every
[1:11:58] teaching of trinitary and false
[1:12:00] denominational baptisms in order to give
[1:12:03] you the street to stand if you've got to
[1:12:05] stand alone then let's stand anyhow
[1:12:07] because God is Street in the church with
[1:12:10] the anointing of this word we have seen
[1:12:13] him we have heard him and we are sitting
[1:12:15] with him we have sat down with communion
[1:12:19] with Elohim my feeding for from that
[1:12:22] bread word drinking the wine I'm talking
[1:12:25] about communion with Melchizedek we met
[1:12:28] him on the road Church the battle's over
[1:12:30] we know who we are we know where we're
[1:12:33] going we are not struggling tonight
[1:12:35] wondering what's right and which way to
[1:12:37] go and what are we going to do amen God
[1:12:39] has given to us it's in our hands what
[1:12:42] are we going to do with it
[1:12:43] I say we ought to tear down the kingdom
[1:12:46] of hell and establish the kingdom of God
[1:12:48] in every heart in every life thus saith
[1:12:51] the Lord there ought to be a word of
[1:12:52] power and a word of anointing a drive
[1:12:56] out every doubt and every conflict and
[1:12:58] every idea of man our young people need
[1:13:00] some strength Church they need to Holy
[1:13:02] Ghost strength they need strength of
[1:13:04] people that know who they are and what
[1:13:06] they believe in why they believe it
[1:13:08] we're not just a bunch of lukewarm
[1:13:10] jellyfish
[1:13:13] not sure about this I'm not sure about
[1:13:16] that I'm on somebody's going to know
[1:13:18] their God
[1:13:20] all that's going to leave them and it's
[1:13:23] going to happen in the same time that
[1:13:26] that rock is hitting that image there's
[1:13:28] a people that come out of if you watch
[1:13:30] it long enough you'll see that that that
[1:13:31] rock will grow into a great Mountain
[1:13:34] she'll be that great pyramid Mountain
[1:13:36] that great bride of Christ will come out
[1:13:39] of that revelation
[1:13:41] it's not going to quit grow until it
[1:13:43] takes over friends
[1:13:46] it happens in that there's going to be a
[1:13:48] people that follows it Revelations 10
[1:13:49] tells us that in the days of the voice
[1:13:51] of the seventh angel the mystery of God
[1:13:53] is it okay if I remove this the mystery
[1:13:55] of God will be finished amen that he
[1:13:58] hath declared unto his servants the
[1:14:00] prophets I'm just going to lay it there
[1:14:02] somebody will have to move it in a
[1:14:03] minute but amen the mystery of God would
[1:14:05] be finished according to beginning and
[1:14:07] ending Gentile dispensation brother
[1:14:09] Braham said the mystery of God is God in
[1:14:12] you
[1:14:14] brother you mean the Creator is going to
[1:14:17] take flesh
[1:14:18] and not just any flesh but your flesh
[1:14:22] have you ever really let that sink down
[1:14:25] into that heart that God is intending on
[1:14:28] claiming your flesh
[1:14:31] brother I tell you it's powerful
[1:14:34] it's a powerful time it's a powerful
[1:14:36] generation amen that it's a happening of
[1:14:39] God in you the hope of glory now the
[1:14:42] people shall know their God and shall do
[1:14:45] exploits brother bam ties them two
[1:14:46] things together the mystery God in you
[1:14:49] and shall know their God
[1:14:51] in Ephesian Church age brother Brown
[1:14:53] says it like this Daniel heard those
[1:14:54] seven Thunders and were forbidden and
[1:14:56] John heard the voices in the book and
[1:14:58] was sealed and the back of the book was
[1:14:59] sealed with Seven Seals but in the days
[1:15:01] of those seals to be opened the mystery
[1:15:04] of God would be finished in other words
[1:15:06] God would be made known to the church
[1:15:11] now I know these quotes and there's some
[1:15:13] things could be taught around them but
[1:15:14] y'all let's just get the point of it the
[1:15:16] mystery of God would be finished and in
[1:15:19] other words God would be known in his
[1:15:22] church not in three people but in one
[1:15:25] person
[1:15:26] he's just one person amen now the
[1:15:29] mystery of God brother bam said that's
[1:15:31] it he said to know who the at the
[1:15:33] finishing of the seventh seal the
[1:15:34] mystery of God should be finished to
[1:15:36] know who God is to know what he is how
[1:15:39] he lives his nature and his being you're
[1:15:41] supposed to be all the way up here by
[1:15:43] that time
[1:15:45] bringing us into a full stature of Sons
[1:15:47] and Daughters of God a church that's
[1:15:49] washed in the blood of Christ
[1:15:52] see it was a great mystery it was a
[1:15:55] great mystery but brother Branham said
[1:15:58] sure it's a great mystery but it's all
[1:16:00] solved now
[1:16:02] brother I tell you if you did anybody in
[1:16:05] here study DNA do you all know that they
[1:16:08] finally solved the language of DNA in
[1:16:10] other words it was a mystery of the of
[1:16:13] the numbers and the language and it was
[1:16:15] the symbols and it was a mystery because
[1:16:16] it wasn't all solved out it was they
[1:16:18] were working on it but one point when
[1:16:21] they finally solved all of it they said
[1:16:23] okay it's solved now every condition
[1:16:27] every DNA of man is in this certain
[1:16:29] number and it might have to be
[1:16:31] reassorted or have to be split a certain
[1:16:33] way but it all exists now so they solved
[1:16:36] it out when William Branham broke the
[1:16:38] seven seal he solved it out
[1:16:40] the the message holds the revelation of
[1:16:43] the entire thing that my goodness it's
[1:16:46] all in there
[1:16:47] you want Rapture it's in there you want
[1:16:49] the healing that's in there you want the
[1:16:51] power of God it's in there it's all
[1:16:53] there brother bam said they see that
[1:16:55] it's all been solved now it's been
[1:16:57] solved for a purpose God didn't just
[1:16:59] solve it he solved it for somebody if
[1:17:01] you ever think about this God knows his
[1:17:03] word why do you write a Bible
[1:17:05] for you
[1:17:07] God knew who he was why did he send the
[1:17:09] prophet so you would know who he was so
[1:17:12] the message in for God is for you and
[1:17:15] it's for you to know God and if you know
[1:17:16] God it will bring strength into your
[1:17:19] life amen it'll make you strong now of
[1:17:22] course in Abraham's Covenant brother
[1:17:23] Brown tells us about the Covenant and I
[1:17:25] I know you're a well-taught church so I
[1:17:27] don't have to teach I'm just going to
[1:17:28] mention it and move on I know where
[1:17:29] you're at so but but y'all know that the
[1:17:32] Covenant that God made with Abraham in
[1:17:33] Genesis 15 was Jesus Christ Jesus it's a
[1:17:37] lot of scripture on it but Jesus was the
[1:17:39] Covenant of God
[1:17:40] he was the unconditional Covenant he's
[1:17:42] what God was going to do no matter what
[1:17:44] Abraham did I will bless the according I
[1:17:46] Will Bless thee and then Isaac thy seed
[1:17:49] shall be blessed that was the blessing
[1:17:50] upon him was the blessing of Jesus
[1:17:52] Christ and Jesus was the Covenant of God
[1:17:56] now brother Brown discusses Old
[1:17:57] Testament covenants he said you lay out
[1:17:59] a you've got two men making a promise
[1:18:01] now if me and you made a promise we
[1:18:03] shook hands on the promise that's our
[1:18:04] covenant was the handshake God's
[1:18:07] covenant with man was Calvary
[1:18:09] all right now what he done was he said
[1:18:11] like if I was promising to do something
[1:18:13] you were promising and we laid a dead
[1:18:15] Beast out in front of us he said now we
[1:18:16] split the Beast he said in that Beast
[1:18:19] being split was the confirmation that if
[1:18:22] either of us broke our word we would be
[1:18:24] as this dead Beast he said so so you all
[1:18:27] know what I'm talking about it used to
[1:18:29] be a covenant was a handshake you know
[1:18:31] and somebody said well I'll take that
[1:18:32] car and you give him a hundred dollars
[1:18:33] you shook a hand if it was a month and
[1:18:35] you come back car sitting there it's
[1:18:37] your car right because the handshake was
[1:18:39] a covenant don't try that now buddy
[1:18:41] but you can you can buy something on the
[1:18:44] phone before you get there somebody
[1:18:45] offered them 10 more dollars is gone
[1:18:47] because nobody's word's good it's not a
[1:18:49] covenant a handshake's not a covenant
[1:18:51] and you got to get it and he can steal
[1:18:53] it probably got a lawyer and get them
[1:18:55] out of it
[1:18:56] but when God made a covenant with man he
[1:18:58] made it through Jesus Christ
[1:19:01] that was God's covenant with man now
[1:19:03] brother Baron said what he does he broke
[1:19:04] open the body and he said and God took
[1:19:07] the spirit out of Jesus Christ he said
[1:19:10] and gave that Spirit to Mankind and he
[1:19:13] took the body back to heaven where he
[1:19:16] holds the Corporal body of Jesus as his
[1:19:19] part of the Covenant and he gave you the
[1:19:22] spirit as your part of the Covenant so
[1:19:25] if you're a covenant holder you hold the
[1:19:27] power of God by his spirit because
[1:19:30] you're Gentiles right amen the only way
[1:19:32] you have a connection to God is by the
[1:19:34] spirit of God which makes you abrahamic
[1:19:36] Covenant and if you hold the spirit of
[1:19:38] God everything in God is in the church
[1:19:41] by his Spirit by his Covenant now the
[1:19:45] thing he did was he gave you his Spirit
[1:19:47] brother bam said he took the body now
[1:19:48] you've got part of the Covenant he got
[1:19:50] part of the Covenant and he said that
[1:19:51] Covenant was made with man now the
[1:19:53] prophet tells us and see not everybody
[1:19:55] says it like this he said but see that
[1:19:58] Covenant builds strength as it ages go
[1:20:01] along it would be like you're making a
[1:20:03] covenant and saying you say to somebody
[1:20:04] I'm going to I'm going to give you a
[1:20:06] million dollars but I'll give you the
[1:20:07] first 300 000 I'm going to wait 10 years
[1:20:10] give you another 300 000. I'm gonna wait
[1:20:12] 10 years until I complete or fully give
[1:20:15] you the Covenant right
[1:20:17] so what was up Through the Ages was the
[1:20:19] Holy Ghost right brother said holy ghost
[1:20:20] in every age so they got part of their
[1:20:22] life they got parties all the way up
[1:20:24] Through the Ages the church ages it was
[1:20:26] a Son of God dispensation so all the way
[1:20:29] up through there the Son of God was
[1:20:31] being ministered by the baptism of the
[1:20:33] spirit and it was being manifested in
[1:20:34] that so we got it in justification it
[1:20:36] wasn't the whole thing but it was the
[1:20:38] Holy Ghost it wasn't the whole thing but
[1:20:40] it was the Holy Ghost remember
[1:20:41] Brotherman said it was an every age but
[1:20:43] what it was doing was coming to full
[1:20:45] strength and brother random says it like
[1:20:47] this he said see but when you can come
[1:20:49] to say I and my father are one and these
[1:20:52] other things then the shut pulls away
[1:20:54] and the real genuine bride church will
[1:20:57] come forth in the entire word in its
[1:21:01] fullness and in its strength my he's the
[1:21:05] same yesterday today and forever you say
[1:21:08] what are you talking about preacher I'm
[1:21:09] saying that Pentecost giveth strength to
[1:21:11] you A lot of people look back to Azusa
[1:21:14] and they said well if we could have what
[1:21:15] they have are you kidding me
[1:21:17] are you kidding me the everything good
[1:21:21] that was in Martin Luther is in this
[1:21:23] bride
[1:21:24] everything good that was him John Wesley
[1:21:26] is in this bride everything good that
[1:21:29] was in Azusa Pentecost is in this Bride
[1:21:32] come on Church the life that produced
[1:21:35] that was only trying to bring it to the
[1:21:37] seed and now we don't have part of it
[1:21:40] we've got the fullness of God through
[1:21:42] the fullness of his word to the fullness
[1:21:45] of his people what are we talking about
[1:21:47] the strength of this message amen is
[1:21:49] stronger than Pinnacle it's stronger
[1:21:52] than being justified it's the strength
[1:21:54] of God coming into the church in the
[1:21:57] reality of his word now brother Branham
[1:21:59] says the shut giveth strength into the
[1:22:01] sea he said it's been a good shot but it
[1:22:03] served its purpose now it's the
[1:22:05] wordbride of the word groom you said
[1:22:08] preacher what are you talking about I'm
[1:22:09] talking about your prophecy now there's
[1:22:10] a people that shall know their God
[1:22:13] the bride will know the revealed word
[1:22:15] the prophet gave us the revealed word so
[1:22:19] you could fulfill Daniel 11.
[1:22:21] but it also says she will be strong
[1:22:25] so where does the strength of this Bride
[1:22:27] come from Brother Bynum says that he
[1:22:29] said see see the shot giveth strength to
[1:22:32] the seed Amen in other words the life
[1:22:35] that was in the plant has been dumped
[1:22:38] out into the seed and the Covenant that
[1:22:40] God made by the church has come to full
[1:22:42] strength I don't have time to teach on
[1:22:44] it I hope you know what I'm talking
[1:22:45] about but the son of man come full and
[1:22:48] Elohim when Elohim come to Abraham it
[1:22:50] was the word in dust right it was the
[1:22:52] son of man in the father age then the
[1:22:55] son of man came in the sun age of Jesus
[1:22:58] Christ stood there as the son of man and
[1:23:00] fully manifested God in the sun
[1:23:02] dispensation but in the Holy Ghost
[1:23:05] dispensation the son of man has never
[1:23:09] been manifest and in the last days the
[1:23:12] fullness of the son of man is to be
[1:23:14] manifested under the ages and God would
[1:23:17] step down into this bride and breathe
[1:23:20] life and shrieked into this church
[1:23:23] straight for Rapture strength for
[1:23:25] anointing straight to overcome Amen in
[1:23:28] this weak and wicked age strength has
[1:23:31] been promised said preacher what do you
[1:23:33] say and I'm saying the Bible said amen
[1:23:35] strength I love David y'all like David
[1:23:37] Dave is a powerful writer I'm a I'm I
[1:23:40] pay attention to the rider I if I'm
[1:23:43] reading the scripture I say who wrote
[1:23:44] this because I think sometimes it has a
[1:23:47] inflection of the man doing the writing
[1:23:49] and David David says in Psalms 28 he
[1:23:52] said for the Lord is strength in my
[1:23:55] shield now if there's anybody had a
[1:23:57] right to to to to read that and write
[1:24:00] that and to sing that David a line
[1:24:02] killer a bear killer a boy a ruddy boy
[1:24:05] lion killer Goliath killer he said for
[1:24:08] the Lord is my strength it's not my
[1:24:10] muscles it's not my intellect the Lord
[1:24:13] is my strength and he's my shield and my
[1:24:16] heart is trusted in him and I am helped
[1:24:18] therefore my hurt gladly rejoicing my
[1:24:20] song will I praise him the Lord is their
[1:24:23] strength isn't it powerful he is the
[1:24:26] saving strength of the anointed you say
[1:24:29] well I don't know how that person keeps
[1:24:31] going it's the Lord
[1:24:34] keep moving it's the Lord how you walk
[1:24:37] you walk right in the most wicked age
[1:24:38] it's the Lord
[1:24:40] for the Lord is my strength listen David
[1:24:43] says it like this in Psalms 84 I love
[1:24:45] this Psalm and y'all forgive me if I get
[1:24:47] a little carried away reading David it
[1:24:48] just it just bubbles my heart
[1:24:51] blessed is the man
[1:24:53] whose strength is in me David said if a
[1:24:56] man has God is his strength that's a
[1:24:58] blessed man hey you talk about strength
[1:25:01] that don't run out in your old age
[1:25:02] you're talking about strength that don't
[1:25:05] run out in weary times you can the Bible
[1:25:07] said amen that it would teach you how to
[1:25:10] run and not become weary you can walk
[1:25:13] and you cannot faint because the
[1:25:15] strength of the Lord comes into the
[1:25:17] Church of the Living God blessed is a
[1:25:19] man who strength is in thee I love some
[1:25:22] of these types that David said he said
[1:25:24] we're passing through the valley of baka
[1:25:25] make it away on the rain filleth the
[1:25:27] pools and they go from strength to
[1:25:29] strength now you if you studied that
[1:25:31] scripture the valley Baka it's really
[1:25:32] not an actual Valley it's a it's a
[1:25:34] figure of speech
[1:25:36] it's talking about dry places it's
[1:25:38] talking about a man walking Gavin the
[1:25:40] Blues he's going through a bad time and
[1:25:43] he said but the Valley of Baca God will
[1:25:45] make it a whale if he's your strength
[1:25:47] you can get in the driest place come on
[1:25:49] it was bad it was a it was uh therein
[1:25:52] Bathsheba wasn't it that they actually
[1:25:54] named The Well when ham when Hagar amen
[1:25:57] she juggle well and she said he's the
[1:25:59] Lord that seeth and heareth me he knows
[1:26:02] me it's not just you no God God knows
[1:26:05] you and he knows you by vain you're not
[1:26:07] going to strengthen the church to know
[1:26:09] that when they're walking through the
[1:26:11] valley of the Baka that God will make a
[1:26:13] whale there and they fill the pools you
[1:26:16] can't dry up a Church of the Living God
[1:26:18] because they got an Artesian well coming
[1:26:21] now come on little church what makes
[1:26:23] your bubble is it the deer drinking no
[1:26:26] sir amen is it the squirrel drinking no
[1:26:28] sir but there's something on the inside
[1:26:30] that just keeps bubbling out of the
[1:26:33] church because God has put something in
[1:26:36] her she's an Artesian whale she's a
[1:26:39] Fountain of Life
[1:26:42] I know the prophecy concerning you a
[1:26:44] river of Living Water shall flow out of
[1:26:47] thy belly
[1:26:49] for he that has the strength now the
[1:26:52] Bible said he would move from strength
[1:26:54] to strength that troubled me
[1:26:56] strength of strength what's that even
[1:26:58] mean
[1:26:59] you ever think about that move strength
[1:27:01] to strength and I got to look at it up
[1:27:03] and I thought my goodness it's got to
[1:27:05] have a better somebody gotta somebody
[1:27:07] got to say it different for this
[1:27:08] hillbilly to catch it
[1:27:09] so I got into that uh I got into that uh
[1:27:12] Amplified Bible is that okay to quote
[1:27:14] here that Amplified Bible and they just
[1:27:16] said something real good they didn't
[1:27:17] change it they just said it different
[1:27:18] and it caught me they said go from
[1:27:21] strength to strength increasing in
[1:27:23] Victorious power I said Ah that's it hey
[1:27:27] man when a man when his strength is
[1:27:29] coming from the Lord he just goes from
[1:27:33] power to power he goes from Victory to
[1:27:36] Victory he's increasing listen now when
[1:27:39] I I preached this and my wife asked me
[1:27:41] she said you know she knows she said hon
[1:27:44] she said you know you preaching the
[1:27:46] church is getting stronger she said
[1:27:48] you know there's been a lot of Trials
[1:27:51] there's been a lot of Trials and I said
[1:27:53] that's right hun we got to talking about
[1:27:55] it and the lord gave me something I I
[1:27:57] was just saying I'm sorry I'm simple
[1:27:59] God's got to show me real simple way and
[1:28:02] I got to looking at it and I got to
[1:28:03] thinking about back before covet y'all
[1:28:05] remember that back before covid you know
[1:28:08] that really was before covid
[1:28:12] that was there was a time called before
[1:28:14] covid when everything was wonderful
[1:28:17] restaurants were good you could get a
[1:28:19] meal you know and it was a different
[1:28:22] world y'all know what I'm talking about
[1:28:23] hey man but but you know some of you
[1:28:26] were sitting in church back then
[1:28:28] before all this stuff before all the
[1:28:31] separations and trouble before before
[1:28:33] the believe the sign movement and before
[1:28:35] all the critics rose up and ever you
[1:28:37] know your mom talking about
[1:28:39] right and some of you were saying back
[1:28:41] then Lord I don't know if I'm gonna make
[1:28:44] it till tomorrow
[1:28:46] some of you backed me and you remember
[1:28:48] probably you remember certain services
[1:28:49] or certain times well you said Lord I'm
[1:28:52] so beat I'm so tired this job or this
[1:28:54] this situation at home or this problem
[1:28:57] in the church I don't know if I'm going
[1:28:59] to make tomorrow but after after believe
[1:29:02] the sign after kovid after two crazy
[1:29:05] years of of everything that can hit you
[1:29:08] you're sitting here tonight
[1:29:10] you are stronger now than you have ever
[1:29:14] been
[1:29:15] you are getting stronger every day
[1:29:17] listen the church ain't getting weaker
[1:29:19] the church is getting stronger and then
[1:29:22] you say well brother Wayne I'm barely
[1:29:23] making it but look how far you've made
[1:29:25] it
[1:29:26] look where you're at you're standing
[1:29:28] here in the most wicked of all ages and
[1:29:32] you're still walking and you're still
[1:29:33] believing and you're still press it and
[1:29:36] you're here on a Friday night
[1:29:39] serving God
[1:29:41] stronger and she's going to continue to
[1:29:45] get stronger see what it is it's a
[1:29:48] spirit that's upon you
[1:29:49] now you know there's types in the Bible
[1:29:51] and one of the types of the church
[1:29:54] brother by Adam said in the remember the
[1:29:55] member of the letter to the church when
[1:29:58] he comes over there and he says he
[1:30:00] picked up the pin and spoken word
[1:30:01] Original Seed and he wrote and he said
[1:30:03] as we come near The Headstone remember
[1:30:05] she'll she'll get less in minority but
[1:30:08] she'll get stronger in anointed or
[1:30:10] stronger in power
[1:30:12] she'll be a stronger Church she won't be
[1:30:14] as many but it'll be stronger remember
[1:30:16] that prophecy amen but there's another
[1:30:18] prophecy he said that there will come a
[1:30:21] messenger in the end time that will tie
[1:30:23] Joshua he said and there'll be another
[1:30:26] name Caleb he said who is a follower of
[1:30:30] Joshua
[1:30:31] amen so so there's two spirits that in
[1:30:34] the days of Moses when they left Egypt
[1:30:37] and they come over into the promised
[1:30:39] land do you know there's only two that
[1:30:41] came out
[1:30:42] they came out and went in only two
[1:30:45] Joshua and Caleb
[1:30:47] and you'll either have to have the
[1:30:49] spirit of Joshua or Caleb Joshua was the
[1:30:53] end-time messenger so we don't have
[1:30:55] Joshua's Spirit we're not Joshua but we
[1:30:57] are Caleb and any believer sitting here
[1:31:01] tonight is a Caleb in the scripture and
[1:31:04] what Caleb did now I I like I said I'm
[1:31:07] that guy I want to see who David's
[1:31:09] talking about David said we're going to
[1:31:10] get stronger I'm thinking who was David
[1:31:13] thinking about when he's saying stuff
[1:31:15] like this
[1:31:16] because David David's thinking about
[1:31:18] somebody what's David thinking about
[1:31:20] he's got some examples that he's looking
[1:31:23] at in the scripture and the whole tribe
[1:31:26] of Israel knows about this 85 year old
[1:31:28] man Caleb who decided at 85. he'd come
[1:31:32] walking in his sister he says to Joshua
[1:31:34] we said look I'm stronger today for war
[1:31:37] than I've ever been now I don't know if
[1:31:39] he was stronger than he ever been but he
[1:31:41] was Stronger for war than he had ever
[1:31:43] been he was ready to fight right then
[1:31:45] just as much as he ever was ready to
[1:31:48] fight you know I think about men of God
[1:31:50] like our brother Sam Dale sitting here
[1:31:52] tonight amen he's stronger now for a war
[1:31:54] that he's ever been amen there's
[1:31:56] something on the inside of that man amen
[1:31:58] listen this message is real
[1:32:00] this message is powerful he's come
[1:32:03] through a lot of crazy stuff for a lot
[1:32:05] of years but there's something on the
[1:32:07] inside of our elders listen I don't
[1:32:09] despise our elders I thank God for our
[1:32:12] elders
[1:32:14] amen they're what holds up the corners
[1:32:16] of the building and we got testimonies
[1:32:18] that God ain't just good to a 15 year
[1:32:21] old and God ain't just good to 20. but
[1:32:23] amen he shows that in the late parts of
[1:32:26] life that the power of this message is
[1:32:28] still just as real then as it was then
[1:32:31] and this man Caleb was more Ready for
[1:32:33] War then and you know what he said to
[1:32:35] you Joshua he said I want I want what
[1:32:37] Moses said I could have
[1:32:39] that's right now that's pretty powerful
[1:32:41] isn't it amen the strength of Caleb was
[1:32:44] that he wanted what was promised him
[1:32:46] now I tell you I think I I do y'all
[1:32:49] identify right there do you all identify
[1:32:51] that something has been promised to you
[1:32:53] and you want what God promised you you
[1:32:55] you're telling you're telling the spirit
[1:32:58] of the Lord I want what God said I could
[1:33:01] have that's all I don't want somebody
[1:33:03] else's portion I don't want what
[1:33:05] Israel's got I don't want what the
[1:33:07] messengers have got I don't know if what
[1:33:09] the other people were supposed to do I
[1:33:11] want what God promised me in this end
[1:33:13] time
[1:33:15] because brother let me tell you that's
[1:33:17] plenty
[1:33:18] that's plenty and Caleb was able to go
[1:33:21] over in that land do you know what Caleb
[1:33:22] was asking for I don't have time to read
[1:33:24] all this would it be okay if I preach it
[1:33:25] you're taught you know what's right amen
[1:33:27] do you know what you know what Caleb was
[1:33:28] asking for he was asking for land he had
[1:33:31] walked on
[1:33:33] 40 years ago when Moses sent him over to
[1:33:37] spy the land
[1:33:39] uh Caleb walked the land of Judah
[1:33:44] he was he was a spy from the tribe of
[1:33:47] Judah which is a powerful thing and I I
[1:33:49] don't want to take you down a long
[1:33:51] Rabbit Trail but I think it's pretty uh
[1:33:52] pretty well known among the church amen
[1:33:54] that Caleb was a gentile originally
[1:33:56] right but how did that Gentile get to be
[1:34:00] that now notice they said 12 over and
[1:34:03] when they when they when they cast lots
[1:34:05] to see whose portion belong where Caleb
[1:34:08] was identified as a leader of Judah to
[1:34:11] find the property that belonged to them
[1:34:14] and he was a gentile can you imagine he
[1:34:17] was a gentile and I said Lord God Amen
[1:34:20] how did that Gentile get so embedded in
[1:34:24] that promise that he was the man that
[1:34:26] went over and walked the ground and then
[1:34:28] I noticed what tribe was from
[1:34:31] he was from the tribe of Judah brother
[1:34:33] amen if he was from the tribe of Judah
[1:34:35] he said Preacher what's that mean to us
[1:34:36] amen that means that tribe that let
[1:34:39] Rahab in was the tribe of Judah that
[1:34:42] tribe that led Tamar amen come in like
[1:34:44] that that was the Triangle she was a Jew
[1:34:46] but look at how she become part of the
[1:34:48] seed line amen that was what happened to
[1:34:50] Ruth she was brought in under the tribe
[1:34:53] of Judah listen Church the bride church
[1:34:56] is brought in under the line of the
[1:34:59] tribe of Judah Jesus Christ it's the
[1:35:03] tribe amen oh God come on there's no
[1:35:07] priesthood coming out of that tribe but
[1:35:09] not of the Aaron priests but there's
[1:35:11] another order that's a Melchizedek
[1:35:14] corner and that's the order the church
[1:35:16] has come under him a young time my
[1:35:19] goodness of possession and an
[1:35:21] inheritance in the promises of God under
[1:35:24] the lion of Judah under Jesus Christ has
[1:35:27] made you and put you into that lamp and
[1:35:30] the same thing came Caleb did when he
[1:35:32] looked at that land and he come back and
[1:35:34] all of them was looking at the Giants
[1:35:36] and they said we can't do it and brother
[1:35:39] Mann said now there's a big difference
[1:35:40] between Caleb and the other spies he
[1:35:43] said they were looking at the Giants and
[1:35:45] Caleb was looking at the promises and I
[1:35:48] tell you there's a there's a spirit
[1:35:49] that's resting on the Church of the
[1:35:51] Living God Amen the world is looking at
[1:35:54] the giant they're looking at the problem
[1:35:56] they're looking at the situation but the
[1:35:58] bride church is looking at the promises
[1:36:00] of God and there's something Rising
[1:36:03] about of the ministry saying we are more
[1:36:05] than able to take this land we can take
[1:36:08] it we can do it because God said we can
[1:36:10] do it
[1:36:11] do you see only Caleb went in under
[1:36:13] Joshua
[1:36:15] if you're going to go in you can only go
[1:36:17] in by looking at the promises of God and
[1:36:20] look at I kind of laughed I kind of
[1:36:22] laugh when I think about this I laugh
[1:36:24] about where in the world did those
[1:36:26] giants live is in that land when Caleb
[1:36:28] went after his land he didn't just go
[1:36:29] after any land brother he went after the
[1:36:31] real land
[1:36:33] hey man those giants took over the best
[1:36:35] land
[1:36:36] I've asked this just so you can really
[1:36:38] understand this point uh if there's a
[1:36:41] guy six four and 280 pounds walked in a
[1:36:43] room where is he set
[1:36:44] where he wants to
[1:36:48] he says where he wants to
[1:36:50] and where did the Giants live where they
[1:36:52] wanted to
[1:36:54] and then the best parts of the land was
[1:36:56] around the tribe of Judah and that Judah
[1:36:58] that Judah y'all know what Judah stands
[1:37:00] for it stands for praise do you know
[1:37:02] where the best you know where the big
[1:37:04] giants move in they move into praise
[1:37:06] they move into worship they move into
[1:37:07] the power of God and those giants move
[1:37:10] in to hold the children of God out but
[1:37:13] you'll never Hulk hate about
[1:37:15] you'll never hold Caleb out of that land
[1:37:17] because he knows it belongs to him by
[1:37:19] the promises of God and as long as he
[1:37:22] knows it's his he's going to go take
[1:37:24] that land and the Bible tells us of
[1:37:26] course Caleb did it and he was
[1:37:28] strengthened to believe it even in his
[1:37:30] old age come on y'all know y'all know
[1:37:32] y'all know that Abraham got stronger as
[1:37:35] he got older
[1:37:36] Bible said he didn't grow weak but he
[1:37:39] grows strong in faith amen he was
[1:37:42] nursing from El shadiah from the
[1:37:44] promises of God how is this bride
[1:37:47] getting stronger the age is getting
[1:37:49] harder the things are getting worse
[1:37:51] problems are getting how you're going to
[1:37:53] get stronger because you're nursing from
[1:37:55] El shadia you're hooked into the
[1:37:57] blessings of God by the promises of God
[1:37:59] you're nursing you're nursing it back of
[1:38:03] course strengthened I know this Bible
[1:38:05] said if you wait upon the Lord you shall
[1:38:07] renew your strength well let me ask you
[1:38:08] how long we're going to wait
[1:38:11] come on church I'm not just saying this
[1:38:13] how long are we going to wait before we
[1:38:15] recognize that the Lord has come Among
[1:38:18] Us
[1:38:18] we waited but with the waiting is over
[1:38:21] the time has arrived I say high time for
[1:38:25] the Church of the Living God to
[1:38:26] recognize who it is that's Among Us the
[1:38:29] same God that defeated Giants in the
[1:38:31] days of Caleb is here to defeat Giants
[1:38:34] in the days of the Church of the Living
[1:38:36] God he said preacher what are you trying
[1:38:38] to do get us to tackle a giant
[1:38:39] absolutely
[1:38:41] I'm trying to get you to tackle every
[1:38:43] giant that says you can't do it every
[1:38:45] giant that says there's no more healing
[1:38:47] kill that giant with the sword of the
[1:38:49] word of God pick your sword up and fight
[1:38:51] back have the strength the prophet of
[1:38:54] God gave us a third pull message and he
[1:38:56] said it was a sword of the Lord he said
[1:38:58] but it matters the hand it gets into
[1:39:00] whether it has the strength of the faith
[1:39:03] to hold that sword and I believe if
[1:39:05] you're nursing from this promise you
[1:39:07] believe you can do anything any place
[1:39:09] through Christ because God said you can
[1:39:11] he said preacher what are we supposed to
[1:39:13] do well I think we're ought to take some
[1:39:15] action yeah sorry I think we are I think
[1:39:18] we ought to get away from this passive
[1:39:20] faith and get back into an action well
[1:39:23] to get back from just learning what's
[1:39:24] about and put it in action come on
[1:39:26] Church there was six wings he humbled
[1:39:28] himself he was reverent but he had to
[1:39:30] fly and I'll tell you this the church
[1:39:32] has to get into action with the word of
[1:39:34] God come on we're not just hearers of
[1:39:37] this word we're doers of this word
[1:39:40] y'all believe that
[1:39:45] of that word can I can I give you the
[1:39:47] scripture here in Daniel 11. let me just
[1:39:49] re rehearse this to you the people that
[1:39:51] know their God who am I talking to now
[1:39:52] the people that who am I talking to
[1:39:55] tonight the the people that know their
[1:39:58] God you know our God tonight do you know
[1:40:00] him then they shall be strong come by
[1:40:02] somebody said I'm strong
[1:40:04] I'm strong why are you strong because I
[1:40:06] know God
[1:40:07] he's revealed himself in this age
[1:40:09] strength has come into the church amen
[1:40:12] and you say well I'm strong but the
[1:40:14] Bible said you're going to do exploits
[1:40:16] that's a powerful word isn't it exploits
[1:40:19] exploit it's a powerful word exploits
[1:40:21] now you don't want that word actually
[1:40:22] it's got several definitions but one of
[1:40:25] them I want I want to just take for a
[1:40:27] moment as we're getting kind of getting
[1:40:28] wound up here to close amen one of them
[1:40:31] actually means action exploit means
[1:40:34] action
[1:40:35] exploit means actions it it's and they
[1:40:38] shall have action they'll be strong and
[1:40:41] they'll be doers of the word of God do
[1:40:43] you know what the prophet said in God's
[1:40:44] provided lamb 1964. he said now he will
[1:40:48] how will he be made known he we will
[1:40:50] know him by his nature and what he does
[1:40:53] and how he works he said I am the vine
[1:40:54] and you are the branches and the branch
[1:40:56] Bears the fruit not the vine the vine
[1:40:58] energizes the branch he said and if the
[1:41:01] branch ever brings forth a Vine it'll
[1:41:03] bring forth a branch it has a grape on
[1:41:05] it the next Vine comes out the branch of
[1:41:06] the vine there'll be grapes on it if the
[1:41:09] first church that come off of that vine
[1:41:11] was a Pentecostal church with the gifts
[1:41:12] if that ever really puts forth another
[1:41:15] Branch they'll write another book of
[1:41:18] Acts behind it and that's what they had
[1:41:22] in the days of the Apostles and the
[1:41:24] apostolic age has never ended isn't that
[1:41:28] powerful this isn't that a prophet see
[1:41:30] and they shall have actions and brother
[1:41:32] random says if the bride ever puts forth
[1:41:35] if God ever brings forth that Bride come
[1:41:38] on church I'm not talking to a future
[1:41:39] people he said the alpha has become the
[1:41:42] Omega I'm looking at it it's not it's
[1:41:45] not there's going to be a virtuous
[1:41:46] sinless bride brother man said you are
[1:41:49] The Virtuous sinless bride so we've
[1:41:51] arrived there I'm not talking to another
[1:41:53] group I'm not talking to Moses or even
[1:41:55] brother Branham I'm not even talking to
[1:41:57] their age I'm not talking to some future
[1:41:59] super generation that's coming I'm
[1:42:02] talking to you tonight I don't know if
[1:42:04] there's 10 days left church I believe
[1:42:07] it's now I believe we are the people of
[1:42:09] the Bible I believe this is the
[1:42:11] generation of promise I believe it I
[1:42:13] believe I have a right to believe it and
[1:42:15] if it ever happens brother man said
[1:42:16] it'll be a continuation in the book of
[1:42:18] Acts how many knows the book of Acts
[1:42:19] never was finished
[1:42:21] because it's the acts of God in the
[1:42:23] apostles
[1:42:24] it's the acts of God in the apostles and
[1:42:27] God is still acting in the church it
[1:42:30] will be a cue Church Revelation book
[1:42:32] it'll be a true church the true church
[1:42:35] is a continuation of the book of Acts
[1:42:39] that's right it's a continuation in the
[1:42:41] book of Acts her actions will be God
[1:42:44] moving through the church now watch this
[1:42:46] the it's a powerful thing it's not only
[1:42:49] action but exploit speaks it speaks of
[1:42:52] military maneuvering like if you like
[1:42:55] Russia's they're having exploits over
[1:42:57] there shock and awe you know they're
[1:42:59] bombing and they're they're in exploits
[1:43:01] they're sending their military out
[1:43:02] they're doing Maneuvers they're exploits
[1:43:05] they're actions they're not just got
[1:43:06] missiles they're shooting them ain't
[1:43:08] just got armies they're sending them
[1:43:10] into action it's exploits brother man uh
[1:43:13] of course uh one of the definitions
[1:43:15] actually says at a large-scale military
[1:43:17] accent uh exercise now of course the
[1:43:21] Bible is telling us that the wicked
[1:43:23] shall do wickedly so they're acting
[1:43:26] right the wicked shall do wickedly so
[1:43:29] they're acting but the wise shall know
[1:43:31] their God and they shall do exploits now
[1:43:34] if you see that the church begins to do
[1:43:36] exploits listen these this Church of the
[1:43:39] Living God has got that Caleb anointing
[1:43:41] on them and when they look at the
[1:43:44] situation now I don't have enough time
[1:43:46] to preach this so I'm just going to say
[1:43:48] it and move on but I don't care what
[1:43:50] you're doing if you're in church you're
[1:43:52] dealing with Giants
[1:43:56] you got a song service there's Giants
[1:43:58] and a song service it would be reasons
[1:44:00] to not have one sometimes
[1:44:04] sometimes you got to kill some Giants
[1:44:07] sure there's there's Giants and hearing
[1:44:09] preachers
[1:44:10] somebody said well you should just play
[1:44:11] tapes there's your giant but you got to
[1:44:14] kill a giant to enjoy the word right
[1:44:16] there's Giants there's Giants and
[1:44:18] everything amen but it's according to
[1:44:20] the promises of God so somebody said
[1:44:22] there's healing brother Adam said it
[1:44:24] like this he said see that when Caleb
[1:44:26] and Joshua went in the land and they
[1:44:28] come back with evidence of milk and
[1:44:29] honey he said the milk and honey was the
[1:44:32] healing in the land he said the giant
[1:44:35] that was in the land was that person
[1:44:36] that claimed their healing and didn't
[1:44:38] get it
[1:44:39] so you've got to overcome that giant to
[1:44:43] take the of the milk and honey that come
[1:44:45] out of there
[1:44:45] it was the evidence of it see and every
[1:44:48] in every purpose and everything God has
[1:44:51] there is an absolute Giant in that land
[1:44:54] now if you're talking about the spoken
[1:44:56] word how many of you know people that
[1:44:58] have so misused name it claim it
[1:45:01] they've so misused positive thinking and
[1:45:04] just say it and just confess it and and
[1:45:06] they made it like somehow that you could
[1:45:09] operate outside of the will of God
[1:45:12] come on Church y'all know very well that
[1:45:15] Jesus was asked of the the devil to cast
[1:45:17] down the bread Stone and make it into
[1:45:19] bread and Jesus wouldn't do it
[1:45:22] because he was showing you the power of
[1:45:24] God is not to be operated to show off
[1:45:26] for the devil brother Brown said it
[1:45:29] clearly he said he wouldn't make the
[1:45:30] devil's bread I like that he wouldn't
[1:45:33] make bread for the devil but later he
[1:45:35] took a he took a little boy's lunch and
[1:45:38] fed five thousand to show he could do it
[1:45:40] but he didn't do it for the devil he'd
[1:45:42] done it for his father so the Church of
[1:45:45] the Living God must know that there's
[1:45:47] all kinds of things that happen but the
[1:45:49] inheritance of this church the
[1:45:52] inheritance of this bride there is a
[1:45:54] portion of this am I okay on time y'all
[1:45:56] okay he told me y'all was a three-hour
[1:45:59] church so I'm only going to go about an
[1:46:00] hour
[1:46:02] right they'll all love you later brother
[1:46:06] now this is a 14-point sermon and I'm in
[1:46:09] point three
[1:46:11] I'm not going to go to 14. I'm just
[1:46:13] teasing
[1:46:15] uh a good friend of mine said it like
[1:46:18] this brother Dave sawley's preaching one
[1:46:19] day and he says he said can I have
[1:46:20] another five minutes and he looks around
[1:46:22] the congregation he said anybody give me
[1:46:24] five minutes uh just go ahead and raise
[1:46:26] your hand anybody give me five minutes
[1:46:28] to raise your hand
[1:46:29] 5 10 15 20 25. come on hands
[1:46:35] yeah it tricked you didn't I
[1:46:39] but see there's an inheritance in the
[1:46:42] church
[1:46:43] you got to see what what's the
[1:46:46] inheritance is what is the land that
[1:46:48] we're looking for what's the place of
[1:46:51] our what's the place that we've been
[1:46:53] birthed to possess that's what we're
[1:46:55] some reason you're born there's a
[1:46:57] there's an anointing and action that
[1:47:00] comes upon the church and and you know I
[1:47:03] see Caleb taking his Mountain
[1:47:05] now if you say what's Caleb's mountain
[1:47:08] today well when brother Brandon was here
[1:47:10] he showed us Seven Peaks in a mountain
[1:47:13] remember and he spelled his name he said
[1:47:16] and there were Seven Peaks spelled the
[1:47:18] name Branham did anybody ever realize
[1:47:19] that God changed Abram's name to Abraham
[1:47:23] making it seven letters
[1:47:25] projecting seven letters those mountains
[1:47:27] were already there folks
[1:47:29] so so God changed Abraham's name to
[1:47:32] seven letters because there was another
[1:47:33] name on his mind
[1:47:35] that ended in ham before Abraham was
[1:47:40] right he was already talking about this
[1:47:42] message
[1:47:43] and give it the ham seven letters in the
[1:47:46] Peaks brother man said three of them
[1:47:48] Peaks and they said the last one was the
[1:47:50] highest showing the last climax remember
[1:47:53] where it struck in the Continental
[1:47:54] Divide remember it's either this way or
[1:47:57] that he said after that Peak he said
[1:47:59] there's nothing it goes right on out
[1:48:01] into the desert he said it's the last
[1:48:03] Peak it's the last mountain look at
[1:48:04] Abraham's Last Mountain it was in
[1:48:06] Genesis 22 when he went up with Isaac
[1:48:08] and there Jehovah Jireh showed up and he
[1:48:11] found the Animal by creative spoken word
[1:48:15] and what was the last peak of brother
[1:48:17] branham's name it was the spoken word he
[1:48:21] said there was that third pull now
[1:48:23] Church of the Living God I'm one
[1:48:25] preacher that don't believe that the
[1:48:26] third pool was just for somebody else
[1:48:29] I believe the third pull is for the
[1:48:31] Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:48:34] somebody said to me one day he said
[1:48:35] brother brother Wayne if you believe we
[1:48:37] had a third pool was our first two I
[1:48:39] said well the first two was ministered
[1:48:40] by an Angel in the cave and it had to do
[1:48:43] with a sign and a hand and the prophecy
[1:48:45] of discerning of Hearts it has nothing
[1:48:46] to do with us it was a Vindication of a
[1:48:49] prophet's message but the third poll was
[1:48:51] the opening of the word which gave us
[1:48:54] our identification and fed the bride
[1:48:56] Church into becoming who she is brother
[1:48:59] how can we not be the third pull the
[1:49:01] third pool created us we are the
[1:49:04] Vindication of it everything about it
[1:49:07] has become the church now of course that
[1:49:10] third poll if you if you're going to go
[1:49:12] up on that mountain the best mountains
[1:49:13] got the biggest Giants and somebody's
[1:49:15] going to say you can't enter there you
[1:49:17] can't go on that land you can't be there
[1:49:18] and I say they're intellectual Giants I
[1:49:21] say they never have believed God but if
[1:49:23] a man really believes God this bride can
[1:49:26] walk in the land of the third pool She's
[1:49:28] On That Mountain friends because God has
[1:49:31] given her that inheritance to go there
[1:49:33] that inheritance was anointed to us I
[1:49:36] got a section on inheritance I'm going
[1:49:37] to skip it amen there's an anointing
[1:49:39] that comes upon them and the prophet of
[1:49:42] God said our inheritance was our names
[1:49:43] written in the Lamb's Book of Life right
[1:49:46] and that inheritance is our names
[1:49:49] written and it's the portion that God
[1:49:51] has anointed us to have do you all know
[1:49:54] this is the only age that Lamb's Book
[1:49:55] was opened in so millions of peoples in
[1:49:58] the Lamb's Book of Life but you know
[1:50:00] your names in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:50:02] why would God do that to bring a perfect
[1:50:04] faith that you would perfectly know who
[1:50:07] you are you would perfectly know he's
[1:50:09] your father and you could stand against
[1:50:11] anything the devil threw at you and know
[1:50:14] it belongs to you by the promise of
[1:50:16] almighty god listen let me say this
[1:50:18] brother bam said this may choke you to
[1:50:20] death but did you know that men that are
[1:50:22] Sons and Daughters of God are amateur
[1:50:24] gods
[1:50:26] how many ever know that Jesus said it in
[1:50:28] the Bible did not the law itself say
[1:50:30] that you are gods and then Genesis 2 he
[1:50:33] made man to be a god did he not
[1:50:35] and brother Madam says it like this I
[1:50:37] love it he said we're waiting for the
[1:50:39] fullness of time when the pyramid gets
[1:50:40] up to the top when full sons of God will
[1:50:43] be manifested anybody anybody know he's
[1:50:46] talking about you when full sons of God
[1:50:48] will be manifested when the power of God
[1:50:51] will walk out Hallelujah and we'll take
[1:50:54] every Power that Satan's got away from
[1:50:56] him
[1:50:59] brother brother brother I'm talking
[1:51:01] about you think you're just some little
[1:51:02] weakling you think you're just somebody
[1:51:04] that just barely making it and you're
[1:51:06] barely getting in Devil's been lying to
[1:51:08] you
[1:51:10] you are the people that know your God
[1:51:12] and have been anointed to do exploits in
[1:51:15] the last day and the devil's trying to
[1:51:17] talk you out of it he's trying to talk
[1:51:20] you into sitting down and being quiet
[1:51:21] and don't get involved and don't you
[1:51:24] claim your inheritance don't you claim
[1:51:26] your rights well listen let me tell you
[1:51:27] what I don't care what the devil thinks
[1:51:29] I've got a right to an inheritance of
[1:51:32] the power of the third pool I'm going to
[1:51:34] claim my children and the devil I don't
[1:51:36] care for the airlift every demon in Hell
[1:51:38] amen I'm gonna claim my god-given
[1:51:41] inheritance and what God gave me and
[1:51:43] stand on that word with a sword of Faith
[1:51:46] because God said I could have it and
[1:51:48] brother random says you'll take every
[1:51:50] Power that Satan's got away from him yes
[1:51:52] sir he said how can we do that in the
[1:51:55] angel in his commission brother Brown
[1:51:56] said this and then you can go hit Satan
[1:51:59] with a scripture and he gets as
[1:52:01] powerless as he can be do you know why
[1:52:03] you got to know the word because that's
[1:52:05] what you hit the devil with
[1:52:07] that's right it's written church it's
[1:52:11] not what you overcome it's how you
[1:52:13] overcome and you put the word in the
[1:52:15] hand of a believer that knows this blend
[1:52:18] belongs to them they can take the word
[1:52:20] and beat the devil off of every bit of
[1:52:22] the property that God gave to them do
[1:52:24] you know the Bible said that God called
[1:52:26] you Gods now I I I'm sorry this this
[1:52:30] scripture gets it it illuminates so
[1:52:33] powerful to me when the Bible said in
[1:52:36] Mark 11 if you say unto this mountain
[1:52:37] you all know that scripture if you say
[1:52:40] unto this mountain and you don't doubt
[1:52:42] in your heart and you tell it to be
[1:52:43] moved it'll be cast in the sea that's a
[1:52:45] powerful scripture isn't it but when you
[1:52:47] hear when you hear Jesus when you hear
[1:52:50] Brother Bradham quote it back listen to
[1:52:52] the difference the way he says it he
[1:52:54] said see he made man a God in dominion
[1:52:56] and it goes from sea to Sea from Shore
[1:52:58] to Shore and he has control of it and
[1:53:01] when Jesus came being the one God
[1:53:05] without sin now there's no not enough
[1:53:08] time to preach that quote
[1:53:11] he was the only little god without sin
[1:53:14] do you see what he's saying he come into
[1:53:17] little god statue
[1:53:19] God came into Humanity
[1:53:22] and he was the only god without sin and
[1:53:26] being an amateur God upon the Earth he
[1:53:28] spoke and he did it and brother man said
[1:53:30] look at this he was the one God without
[1:53:31] sin and he proved it he said when the
[1:53:34] winds blowed he said peace be still and
[1:53:36] when he said to the tree don't eat from
[1:53:38] these he said verily I say unto you
[1:53:40] little gods
[1:53:42] I say unto you little Gods if you'll say
[1:53:45] unto this mountain and now when Jesus
[1:53:47] said he said I say unto you if you say
[1:53:48] brother Ram switches it says I say unto
[1:53:50] you little gods
[1:53:52] see God created you in the beginning to
[1:53:55] be that and the fall took it away from
[1:53:59] you
[1:53:59] but this is the age of restoration and
[1:54:03] the Bible is predicting the people that
[1:54:05] know their God shall return to the
[1:54:07] street and the knowledge of the word and
[1:54:10] by doing so they will take action they
[1:54:13] will take military action how could you
[1:54:15] know what you know and let the devil
[1:54:17] take over come on friend how could you
[1:54:19] know what you know as a father and let
[1:54:21] the devil take over your home how could
[1:54:23] you know what you know as a preacher and
[1:54:26] let the devil take over the church
[1:54:27] brother I tell you what the devil I have
[1:54:29] a handful if he comes into one of these
[1:54:31] churches
[1:54:32] if he comes into one of these homes he's
[1:54:33] got a handful because the people know
[1:54:35] they're gone
[1:54:37] do you see they will take action
[1:54:39] and the Bible says I say unto you for
[1:54:42] this is the manifestation of the sons
[1:54:43] brother Ram said the manifestations of
[1:54:45] son true Sons born son field Sons if
[1:54:48] they take speak the word their word is
[1:54:50] backed
[1:54:52] if they speak the word the word is
[1:54:55] backed I love this quote here brother
[1:54:57] Brown said I believe there's a church on
[1:54:58] the road tonight but I love this quote
[1:55:01] here brother bam said I believe there's
[1:55:02] a church on the road tonight a power of
[1:55:04] the Living God that men will speak the
[1:55:06] word and it'll flash like lightning a
[1:55:09] church is coming out not psychologists
[1:55:11] not some put on or make believe but a
[1:55:14] real true genuine anointed Holy Ghost
[1:55:17] God called Church
[1:55:19] brother speak the word and it'll flash
[1:55:23] like lightning isn't that powerful it'll
[1:55:25] manifest right before them the prophet
[1:55:28] of God said see he has no eyes but mine
[1:55:30] and yours he has no hands but mine and
[1:55:33] yours he energizes us and he brings
[1:55:36] forth life and brings us through whether
[1:55:38] it's by the preaching of the Gospel by
[1:55:40] lip or it's sin Vision by eye whether it
[1:55:43] is the lane on the hands of the sick
[1:55:45] whatever it is it's Christ working
[1:55:47] through the branches of his church and
[1:55:50] every office literally electrified by
[1:55:53] his presence my goodness I sometimes you
[1:55:56] just feel I have to be honest you're
[1:55:58] preaching you feel like about a 4 000
[1:56:00] vote to just
[1:56:02] just electrified what is it it's the
[1:56:05] power of God it's his word speaking and
[1:56:09] casting Spirits from the mind of the
[1:56:11] people telling the hey look if you take
[1:56:13] this word in hand it'll defeat Satan
[1:56:15] anywhere any place any time under any
[1:56:19] condition it'll come through the
[1:56:21] branches of this church do you know that
[1:56:22] brother Branham actually says you're
[1:56:24] living in an age when your thoughts will
[1:56:26] become material
[1:56:29] hey if anybody ever needed the mind of
[1:56:32] the lord we need it
[1:56:34] he said you're living in a time when the
[1:56:36] thought would become material
[1:56:38] do you know in the fifth seal brother
[1:56:40] bran says this he said I believe the
[1:56:42] hours approach him when missing limbs
[1:56:44] will be added
[1:56:47] Miss and limbs will be restored of the
[1:56:49] glory
[1:56:49] the Creator
[1:56:50] I believe if you make
[1:56:52] said a man or woman's got a missing part
[1:56:54] the complete animal itself hey man
[1:56:56] there's a there's a season we're living
[1:56:58] in he said preacher what are you talking
[1:57:00] about can I can I share with you if you
[1:57:01] go read this part in the fifth seal do
[1:57:03] you all know what he you know why he
[1:57:05] says this because he just prayed for a
[1:57:07] little girl with leukemia in the back
[1:57:09] room
[1:57:10] and he says now for God to heal that
[1:57:12] little girl he had to recreate the blood
[1:57:14] cell he said so it was a creation of the
[1:57:17] blood cell in there he said if God can
[1:57:19] do that to heal that leukemia he said
[1:57:22] then I believe we're living in a season
[1:57:23] he could add a Liam back
[1:57:26] now y'all say well that happened in the
[1:57:28] days of brother random you know I it
[1:57:30] literally over there in Norway back
[1:57:32] about six seven years ago I was
[1:57:33] preaching a sermon on the Seven Stars I
[1:57:36] was in the Norway convention with
[1:57:37] brother parrots or summer camp meeting
[1:57:38] and one of the evenings I'm preaching on
[1:57:40] the Seven Stars and I just took the
[1:57:42] Thunders and opened the I opened the
[1:57:44] symbols and instead of saying unto the
[1:57:46] star of the Ephesus age I just said unto
[1:57:48] Paul and under iranius and I was just
[1:57:51] reading the Bible like it would have
[1:57:52] been written if the Thunders hadn't
[1:57:54] sealed it but once it's released the
[1:57:56] seals is off now you can read the book
[1:57:58] right right and I get to the seven star
[1:58:00] and I said nobody has a problem with it
[1:58:02] mother six stars it's a seven star that
[1:58:05] all hails against and unto the angel of
[1:58:08] the church allowed to say so read it the
[1:58:09] way it's written and unto William
[1:58:11] Branham I write
[1:58:13] brother Adam may call the devil's mad
[1:58:15] won't it amen but I'll tell you what
[1:58:18] happened there was a lady sitting in
[1:58:19] that meeting that had been suffering
[1:58:21] with leukemia for about two years she
[1:58:23] was very weak barely could get into the
[1:58:25] meetings I seen her earlier that day and
[1:58:27] she was telling me how bad she'd been
[1:58:29] praying God with a Healer amen she was
[1:58:31] sitting in that meeting a year later I
[1:58:34] seen her at that same meeting she come
[1:58:36] and got me and set me down in the
[1:58:37] lunchroom and she said brother Lawson
[1:58:39] I've been waiting a year to tell you
[1:58:40] this she said you remember preaching on
[1:58:42] them Seven Stars last year I said yeah I
[1:58:44] remember that sis she said when you
[1:58:46] named William Branham as that seven star
[1:58:48] she said that was a Warmness moved over
[1:58:51] me from the top of my head to the bottom
[1:58:53] of my listen to me friends I didn't have
[1:58:55] my hand on her I didn't have her in a
[1:58:57] prayer life and I believe in prayer
[1:58:58] lines you know I do amen but I was
[1:59:01] preaching the word of God and there was
[1:59:03] an anointing that struck that woman and
[1:59:05] she was healed from the top of her head
[1:59:07] to the bottom of her feet because we are
[1:59:10] in the season when the word of God is
[1:59:12] creative and it's anointing and it's
[1:59:15] power amen right now are in the building
[1:59:17] leukemia was healed it's a preacher that
[1:59:19] only happened one time not to me I was
[1:59:21] another person sitting in my meetings
[1:59:23] one day and they were sitting there with
[1:59:24] a tumor right there a man with a tumor
[1:59:27] on his breast he'd been fighting it for
[1:59:28] weeks or maybe even a year by that time
[1:59:30] and they had it covered up and I started
[1:59:33] testifying about God healing cancer and
[1:59:36] in the middle of it by the way he stuck
[1:59:37] his hand in his shirt sitting right
[1:59:39] there and he stood in his feet said
[1:59:41] brother Lawson the thing has just
[1:59:43] disappeared off of my chest amen it
[1:59:46] wasn't an unusual service it was a
[1:59:48] service just like this but there was an
[1:59:50] anointing in that building and let me
[1:59:52] say this that God that healed cancer one
[1:59:54] time can he heal cancer again the god
[1:59:57] that spoke squirrels can speak squirrels
[2:00:00] again the miracle working God is in this
[2:00:03] building and we know him to be God we
[2:00:06] know him to be full of his Mercy the
[2:00:08] same one that created it the first time
[2:00:10] can create it again
[2:00:12] somebody said brother Wayne that's Saint
[2:00:14] John 14 12 don't beloved to the church
[2:00:16] brother Adam says if you can't identify
[2:00:18] there you have spiritual amnesia
[2:00:21] can you be identified there to believe
[2:00:23] that that is the truth if it hasn't then
[2:00:26] you're getting spiritual Amnesia you
[2:00:28] have forgot your Christian balance if
[2:00:31] you can't identify with Mark 11 and John
[2:00:33] 14 The Devils threw you off a balance
[2:00:35] but a True Believer knows that scripture
[2:00:38] was written for this day it hasn't
[2:00:40] happened in other days it has not been
[2:00:43] for other Seasons but this is the age of
[2:00:45] the son of man when the word is becoming
[2:00:48] flesh and the flesh is living now in the
[2:00:51] Church of the Living God listen this is
[2:00:53] the Holy Ghost Tabernacle in the Church
[2:00:55] of the Living God you suppose what are
[2:00:57] you trying to get at I'm trying to say
[2:00:59] pick up your weapon and fight back a
[2:01:01] little while you're anointed to fight
[2:01:03] back you're not anointed to just take
[2:01:06] whatever the devil throws at you you
[2:01:08] don't have to sit and take it you don't
[2:01:10] have to let the devil drag your young
[2:01:12] people off the hell you've got a sword
[2:01:15] it's time to use it mother you gotta
[2:01:17] claiming Victory you can claim them you
[2:01:19] can bring them back he said preacher
[2:01:21] what you're talking about I'm talking
[2:01:23] about getting the Church of the Living
[2:01:24] God to remember who they are remember
[2:01:27] what they're here for remember the
[2:01:29] promises that God has gave us your body
[2:01:31] is the Tabernacle of the deity of
[2:01:33] almighty God it's where the devil's
[2:01:35] powerful let me tell you what brother
[2:01:36] random said he said the atomic weapon is
[2:01:39] not the most powerful weapon in the
[2:01:40] world
[2:01:41] I got news for Mr Putin the atomic
[2:01:44] weapon is not the most powerful thing in
[2:01:46] the world the prophet of God said this
[2:01:48] the greatest power in the world is not
[2:01:50] the atom bomb it is a believer in
[2:01:53] contact with his maker brother
[2:01:59] there's a power in this church
[2:02:01] I feel it Rising right now it's a law
[2:02:04] that activates it it's the law of faith
[2:02:07] it's the law of faith and whatever God
[2:02:10] will lead your soul to believe
[2:02:14] that is yours
[2:02:16] the same as when Caleb put his foot on
[2:02:18] the land when you believe it with your
[2:02:21] heart it is yours and you can possess it
[2:02:23] they will take action they will display
[2:02:26] strength it's talking to you
[2:02:29] amen they will take action they will
[2:02:31] display strength there's talking to you
[2:02:33] listen I'm on I'm I'm closing right here
[2:02:36] I want I want to say this to you
[2:02:38] all hell is against this
[2:02:43] if you thought that you were just going
[2:02:45] to believe this message and walk easy
[2:02:46] you're wrong
[2:02:49] there's Giants in this land and you're
[2:02:51] asking yourself right now if it's right
[2:02:53] why are there so many battles because it
[2:02:55] is right
[2:02:57] it is right you're going the other
[2:02:59] direction all the world is moving that
[2:03:01] way and you're going against the grain
[2:03:04] that's why it's a battle but you were
[2:03:06] built for it brother you were built for
[2:03:08] it brother Brandon said everything is
[2:03:11] against the spiritual revelation of
[2:03:13] Christ being here now
[2:03:15] it's against it it's against it being
[2:03:17] here now now I know I know it ought to
[2:03:19] be I know it ought to be easy it you
[2:03:22] know it ought to be but it ain't
[2:03:25] because God didn't build it that way
[2:03:27] he built it as a Battlefield
[2:03:30] you know uh you know in in the scripture
[2:03:33] there's an artist there's an oddest
[2:03:34] scripture over the Book of Judges
[2:03:36] and you know the Bible said that God
[2:03:38] left Giants in the land after Joshua
[2:03:41] died
[2:03:42] how many ever read that said the Giants
[2:03:44] were left in the land after Joshua died
[2:03:47] it said the generations of the children
[2:03:49] after Joshua died there were people that
[2:03:52] lived and you know why the Giants were
[2:03:54] left there it's it's actually says it in
[2:03:56] Judges chapter 3 it tells you exactly
[2:03:58] why God left Giants in the land
[2:04:01] he said to teach them War
[2:04:07] God intended
[2:04:09] for them to learn more after Joshua left
[2:04:14] it did amazing brother man's been gone
[2:04:16] now
[2:04:17] 57 57 years he's been gone Christmas Eve
[2:04:21] 57 years
[2:04:23] and there's Giants left he said preacher
[2:04:25] wise they're still Giants
[2:04:27] because God had to teach you the war
[2:04:30] young people you got to learn the war
[2:04:33] you got to learn to fight you've got to
[2:04:36] learn to pick up your sword and fight
[2:04:37] back
[2:04:39] Mom and Dad ain't always going to be
[2:04:40] there
[2:04:41] it ain't always going to be that
[2:04:43] somebody else can do the fighting for
[2:04:44] you sometimes you've got to just pick
[2:04:46] your sword up and fight because you've
[2:04:48] got to learn to war you've got to learn
[2:04:50] to overcome you've got to learn to be
[2:04:53] you if y'all got a little youth group
[2:04:55] here got a little Fellowship I guarantee
[2:04:57] you somebody's had their feelings hurt
[2:04:59] because they wasn't invited
[2:05:02] and the best thing for a pastor to do is
[2:05:04] not even have a youth group and then you
[2:05:06] would never have that
[2:05:11] come on Church y'all know I'm telling
[2:05:13] you the truth you'd never have to deal
[2:05:14] with it if you didn't have a youth group
[2:05:16] but if you're going to have a youth
[2:05:18] group and I think it's a good thing
[2:05:20] then you're gonna have some Giants
[2:05:21] you're gonna have to kill so instead of
[2:05:24] wondering what's wrong with the youth
[2:05:25] group know this there's a giant in that
[2:05:27] that don't want you to have that
[2:05:28] Fellowship so pick your sword up and
[2:05:30] quit being a crybaby quit wondering why
[2:05:33] somebody didn't invite me somebody
[2:05:34] didn't call me somebody didn't do it
[2:05:36] it's the devil dying to destroy you pick
[2:05:41] up your sword and fight back
[2:05:46] sorry I don't want to slip over in the
[2:05:48] pastoring gear here but
[2:05:50] y'all know what I'm talking about if
[2:05:53] you're going to have church
[2:05:54] if you're gonna be here if you're going
[2:05:56] to have fellowship and friends and
[2:05:58] that's going to come stuff up in this
[2:06:00] church that's going to come directional
[2:06:02] differences there's going to come ideas
[2:06:03] probably not any Doctrine but one's
[2:06:06] going to think it should be done this
[2:06:07] way and one's going to think and the
[2:06:08] best thing is just don't have church
[2:06:12] there wouldn't be no fighting right
[2:06:14] nobody would argue nobody would feel but
[2:06:17] if you're going to have church you're
[2:06:18] going to have Giants
[2:06:20] but listen it's the word of God that we
[2:06:22] can have church and we can live in unity
[2:06:25] and we can have peace and we can bring
[2:06:27] joy in life but if we're going to do it
[2:06:30] we're going to have to destroy the
[2:06:31] Giants that move in the Church of
[2:06:34] Fellowship no we're not going to shut
[2:06:36] the doors we're going to cut the head
[2:06:38] off of the devil no we're not going to
[2:06:40] quit having Youth groups we're going to
[2:06:42] cut the head off of the devil no we're
[2:06:44] not going to print preaching the word of
[2:06:46] God we're going to cut their head off of
[2:06:48] the devil because it's a god-given right
[2:06:51] to do so
[2:06:52] [Applause]
[2:06:53] ah come on Church
[2:06:56] my goodness y'all's a good crowd
[2:07:00] preacher what are you talking about let
[2:07:01] me tell you what I'm talking about
[2:07:02] fighting ain't just ain't just about
[2:07:05] preaching the word it ain't just that
[2:07:07] that ain't all it is don't you ever
[2:07:09] separate war from worship
[2:07:11] you can't do it you can't separate war
[2:07:13] from praise now if God's teaching you
[2:07:16] how to war he taught them in the Bible
[2:07:18] how to do it didn't he remember what he
[2:07:20] did when he taught David how to war
[2:07:22] David learned it by dancing before the
[2:07:25] Lord listen David learned to play music
[2:07:28] and he learned to war the demons with
[2:07:30] music but David wrote beautiful word he
[2:07:33] understood as God what about Joshua when
[2:07:36] he met the captain of the host and he
[2:07:38] stood in a wall that wouldn't move what
[2:07:40] happened to him he inquired of the Lord
[2:07:43] and God told him you walk down the Walls
[2:07:45] but when it come to the end of it
[2:07:47] remember they begin to praise God before
[2:07:50] the walls ever begin to fall and let me
[2:07:53] tell you this that's the way you wore
[2:07:55] this devil that's the way you wore the
[2:07:57] problems that's the way you are
[2:07:58] sometimes you got to praise God when the
[2:08:01] law is still standing when the problems
[2:08:04] are still there when the travels are
[2:08:06] still there listen amen sometime or
[2:08:08] another you've got to shout before you
[2:08:11] see it you got to praise God before you
[2:08:14] know it's there you say well I'll tell
[2:08:16] you I ain't got no reason to praise God
[2:08:18] it's according to what you're looking at
[2:08:19] if you're looking at the problem no
[2:08:21] ma'am you can't do it but if you're
[2:08:23] looking at the promises of God Amen the
[2:08:25] Bible says you'll overcome it the Bible
[2:08:27] said we're going to be victorious the
[2:08:29] Bible said we could have come on church
[2:08:31] I'm talking to somebody in the Church of
[2:08:34] the Living God that's going to fight
[2:08:36] this devil not just by the word but
[2:08:38] they're going to praise the god of
[2:08:40] Heaven in doing so you know you're going
[2:08:42] to if you ever confuse the devil sister
[2:08:45] you ever confuse the devil hey man I
[2:08:47] know that devil hates me I confuse him I
[2:08:49] confuse confusing Devils I depress
[2:08:52] depression Devils I make nervous Devils
[2:08:55] nervous I make anxiety Devil's anxiety
[2:08:58] amen you said how do you do it I'll tell
[2:09:00] you how I do it just like they've done
[2:09:01] it in the Bible when a great host come
[2:09:04] against Jehoshaphat you know where he
[2:09:05] went he went straight in the temple of
[2:09:07] God and he began to pray and when you
[2:09:09] begin to pray God told him the battle is
[2:09:12] not yours it belongs to the Lord and
[2:09:15] remember what he was told he said look
[2:09:17] you go out in this great company but
[2:09:19] before you go you pick yourself some
[2:09:21] singers and you pick yourself some
[2:09:23] praises and you send them out in front
[2:09:25] of the word and the Bible said I will
[2:09:28] confuse your enemy amen come on I will
[2:09:30] put an ambush on your enemy amen you
[2:09:33] know I'll tell you it's a powerful thing
[2:09:35] and the Bible records that they went
[2:09:37] against a great multitude and the only
[2:09:39] thing they did is worship God in song
[2:09:42] and the Word was coming behind them the
[2:09:45] Army was moving in but by the time the
[2:09:47] Army got there the enemy was already
[2:09:49] defeated listen I tell you what you can
[2:09:52] do tonight you can start praising God
[2:09:55] right now and confuse that devil and
[2:09:58] make him wonder why is this man

[2:19:42] hey man think back this year this year's
[2:19:45] almost over
[2:19:47] 364 days
[2:19:50] I was watching brother Ron Spencer this
[2:19:52] morning and
[2:19:53] y'all know what he's been battling him
[2:19:56] and uh with cancer and all and
[2:19:58] he stood up
[2:20:00] Sunday morning and he told the
[2:20:01] congregation he said I prayed that God
[2:20:04] would let me live to see this Christmas
[2:20:06] [Music]
[2:20:07] and he said here I stand
[2:20:09] and he preached a sermon but he didn't
[2:20:12] seem like no sick man standing in that
[2:20:13] Pulpit
[2:20:15] all that adversity through the whole
[2:20:17] year
[2:20:18] he wanted to stand and preach that
[2:20:20] sermon on Christmas day yes
[2:20:22] do we have that desire you say well I'm
[2:20:25] not battling cancer well you're battling
[2:20:27] everything else
[2:20:29] come right here come into a service and
[2:20:32] say God I'm I'm coming back next Sunday
[2:20:34] I'm coming back Wednesday night I'm
[2:20:36] coming back it's a struggle I tell them
[2:20:39] brother Wayne that that we're not on a
[2:20:41] cruise ship right we're on a battleship
[2:20:44] this is not
[2:20:46] whining and dining
[2:20:48] this is not forks and knives
[2:20:50] them people that are on that boat you
[2:20:52] know what
[2:20:53] on a cruise ship
[2:20:55] happy-go-lucky you on a battleship you
[2:20:59] got a job to do if you don't do your job
[2:21:01] everybody else depends on you they're
[2:21:02] going to die too so you get on that
[2:21:04] Battleship our brother got on the
[2:21:06] battleship tonight and he he sent some
[2:21:09] salvos he sent some he sent some atomic
[2:21:12] bombs over there he didn't just shoot
[2:21:14] you know it's courteous to shoot across
[2:21:16] the bow you know try to get him to stop
[2:21:18] now I think I think I think he struck
[2:21:21] him right in the middle of it you know
[2:21:23] you think about Israel like his
[2:21:25] brother's dad just said it many many
[2:21:27] times you know they sent the singers out
[2:21:28] first they sink the worshipers out first
[2:21:31] well if you were a if you were a battle
[2:21:33] heart veteran on the other side though
[2:21:34] and hear you're getting ready to
[2:21:36] try to beat on some battle-hardened
[2:21:39] veteran on the other side and you see
[2:21:40] the singers coming
[2:21:42] and you see the trumpet players and you
[2:21:45] see everybody worshiping and shouting I
[2:21:47] just about knocked my you know I be like
[2:21:49] man
[2:21:51] well that's the way it is with the devil
[2:21:52] he thinks he's gonna he knows he knows
[2:21:54] how to fight yes devil knows how to
[2:21:57] fight good adversary brother Brown said
[2:21:59] but we've got more than he does we've
[2:22:01] got a power behind us that's
[2:22:04] Eternal his is temporary ours is eternal
[2:22:07] amen you love the Lord give our brother
[2:22:09] another good hand
[2:22:14] and we appreciate we we always always
[2:22:18] um when we bring a minister in we pray
[2:22:21] about it you know we had prayer service
[2:22:22] a few weeks ago to pray that this
[2:22:24] meeting went well and then you know he
[2:22:26] just comes in here and and we don't get
[2:22:28] to talk much and and my for all of y'all
[2:22:30] that's been been sitting listening to me
[2:22:32] for a year you know what we've been
[2:22:33] preaching on we've been preaching on the
[2:22:35] son of man for 77 sermons we've been on
[2:22:39] the son of man and now we've been on
[2:22:41] we've been we've been going up Caleb's
[2:22:43] Mountain amen
[2:22:45] yeah we're down at the bottom but we're
[2:22:47] going up Caleb's Mountain give me my
[2:22:49] Mountain that's my Mountain that's my
[2:22:52] Mountain God give me that mountain at 85
[2:22:55] years old
[2:22:58] you know what he didn't look at
[2:22:59] circumstances and that's what we got to
[2:23:00] quit doing looking at circumstances well
[2:23:03] my children this my you know my children
[2:23:04] not serving the lord well
[2:23:07] why are you looking at circumstances If
[2:23:10] Abraham would have looked at if he'd
[2:23:12] went to the clinic
[2:23:13] come on somebody if he went to the
[2:23:15] clinic
[2:23:16] they just said come on dude you're 99.
[2:23:19] ain't it happening
[2:23:21] he didn't go to a clinic
[2:23:23] he took that promise of God and he said
[2:23:25] I'm gonna have a baby
[2:23:28] many times before you've got to
[2:23:29] literally see your children sitting on
[2:23:31] the front row they may be out in the
[2:23:34] world they may be doing whatever they're
[2:23:35] doing but you gotta literally I mean see
[2:23:37] them sitting there because that's what
[2:23:38] Abraham did Abraham literally saw that
[2:23:41] baby amen right he knew he couldn't do
[2:23:44] anything about him he tried like we do
[2:23:46] we try to get in and you know Lord save
[2:23:49] my kids but no not that much
[2:23:51] now lay it on them Abraham waited until
[2:23:54] he's not there he in other words he just
[2:23:56] said Lord I can't do it anymore you're
[2:23:59] gonna have to do it for me and that's
[2:24:01] where he wants me and you to be and I
[2:24:02] think our brother brought her tonight
[2:24:03] where it's got to be God that's doing it
[2:24:05] not man
[2:24:07] but it's God in men like as we've been
[2:24:09] preaching how many times have we read
[2:24:11] the sermon I mean read the the opening
[2:24:14] open the scripture you ought to be able
[2:24:15] to know it by heart John 1 1. in the
[2:24:18] beginning was the word words with God
[2:24:19] and Word was God and the Word was made
[2:24:21] flesh right that's not Jesus all no
[2:24:25] that's me and you the word was made
[2:24:27] flesh brother Brown said the flesh
[2:24:29] becoming word the word becoming flesh I
[2:24:31] believe that
[2:24:32] right we might have all of our
[2:24:34] differences and come from different
[2:24:35] places and have different DNA in our
[2:24:37] flesh but in our soul if you're born
[2:24:39] again tonight you have the DNA of God
[2:24:41] you are God you're not you're not a
[2:24:43] second person
[2:24:44] you are God made manifest in another
[2:24:46] form that mask was changed how many
[2:24:48] times did we not preach on that a couple
[2:24:50] of times ago the mass was changed and
[2:24:52] now he's in Pride for him that's right
[2:24:53] he showed that in the book in The Book
[2:24:55] of Revelations right from the get-go I'm
[2:24:57] Gonna Be in My bride right and this is
[2:24:59] what's going to happen so God bless you
