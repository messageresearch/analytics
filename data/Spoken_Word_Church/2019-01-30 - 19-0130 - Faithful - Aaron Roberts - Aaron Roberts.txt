we commit all things to you in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen take me up I had to get a prayer cloth there's a man at work that it worked with he's gonna have knee replacement so I don't he might get him gave him a prayer cloth so y'all just remember him Daniel chapter 6 verse 1 says it pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes which should be over the whole kingdom and over these three presidents of whom Daniel was first that the Prince might give accounts unto them and the King should have no damage then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes because an excellent spirit was in him and the King felt to set him over the whole realm then the present presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom but they could not find not occasion nor fault for as much as he was faithful neither was there any error or fault found in him then said these men we shall not find any occasion except this Daniel against this Daniel except we find it against him concerning the law of his God then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king and said thus unto him King Darius live forever all the presidents of the kingdom the governors and the princes and the counselors and the captains have consulted together to establish a royal statute and to make a firm decree that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days save of the O king he shall be cast into the den of lions a man god bless you tonight you may be seated we've all we all know the story of Daniel in the lion's den that's not that's not gonna be anything new to us but you know the one thing that I kept coming back to this the scripture where it talks about Daniel was faithful and it's and that we're just you know being faithful you know God is faithful you know God's not faithful to me he's not faithful to you but he's a fake but he's faithful to his word because he is he is his word you can't separate the two and he's faithful to what what the word says and that's the reason he said the only way that you can approach God is by the word it's through the word that's how we approach God to know and you know there's there's many scriptures in the in the Bible and I didn't I can give these scriptures to them you know just y'all just pray for me you know sometimes like I think we're brother wake was talking about some time back you know you can try to get a sermon together and some are easier than others sometimes you know you feel like you're I don't know you're fighting all you know appeal all the way you know you ain't you know it's like you know it's like trying to push a rope you know you're not getting anywhere but you know God's faithful and you know it's one of the things I was thinking about you know if we try to do anything in ourselves if we try to use our own intellect your own ability to do anything you know we're an ultimate failure you know we mess up anything and you know that's one of the things that God wants us to do sometimes we have to go through trials and tribulations you know to show who we are you know there's many people and and you know I want to look at a couple of different a couple of different people but you know I love some of these things in this is a from the book of psalms psalms 36 5 that David says thy mercy O Lord is in the heavens faithfulness reaches unto the clouds he says I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever with my mouth will I make known by faithfulness to all generations Psalms 89 verse 1 verse 89 verse 2 says for I have said mercy shall be built up forever thy faithfulness shall doubt establish in the very heavens Psalms 89 verse 5 and says and the heavens shall praise thy wonders o Lord thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the Saints Psalms 89 verse 8 says O Lord God of hosts who is a strong Lord like unto thee or to thy faithfulness round about thee and so their Psalms 119 96 thy faithfulness is and all generations thou has established earth and it abideth and limitations tells us that he says talking about the mercies and everything limitations 323 talks about the mercies everything and it says they are new every morning great is thy faithfulness so many times but I you know sometimes if you ever get I don't know if you ever get down if you if you ever get if you get depressed I don't think there's a better book in the Bible to me sometimes than to get in the Book of Psalms you know you start reading you start reading the things that David starts talking about and he starts talking about how God how great God is and had the mercies of God and the grace of God and the healing power of God in his deliverance and all these different things and you know you start realizing you know that's to you and I tell you what you know it's just like a good it's like a good drug sometimes you know everybody wants to find a find the new drug for this and you know they to have a prescription but I tell you what the prescription is this right here doctor Jesus has a wonderful prescription I tell you what you get in the Word of God and you know what it just seems to uplift you and you know what because you can draw on that and you know that's the thing that we have to do is get in to stay in the Word of God because you know you know you can't fight a battle without being behind the word being fortified in the word but I'm so glad that he's faithful he's faithful to us even we're not faithful to him and I want to be faithful I want to be found faithful I want to be as faithful to him as he is to me I want to be found faithful and you know here in the scripture you know I kept coming back to this this this story about David I mean Daniel and you know Daniel was was such a wonderful man he was such such a servant of God that people realized what kind of person he was Darius the King wanted him to be over everybody to be his right-hand man but you know he had such it he had such a a spirit about him you know nobody said they could put a fault a finger on any fault that he had anything that he had done wrong and they said and they said but you know they said the only way that we're gonna get to him why because they were jealous of him and you know you know I want to look at it a thought tonight you know you know what we look at many times we look in the scripture we see things in the Old Testament we look in the scripture we think and you know we don't realize you know those things are the very things are today you know there's no time stamp on the Bible we see those things exactly some why because you know God's Spirit is still moving today in the spirit the devil still moving today this you know the evil spirits are still moving today the same demons that we're back there are still moving today you know we find even even in the scriptures you know we start to see you know the script the scriptures are repeating themselves because those Devils had a had a position they had a job back there and you know what they have the same job today so whatever whatever the that they were doing back there because even you know we'll look at some of that later on but you know hey they still have that position you know what they have come after you that's their that's their position today is to be after after the bride now you know hearing this here in the scripture it says that they Daniel being a being the the greatest one of them all but they all of the other presidents and priests and the counselors and all you know they tried to find something against him and you know they knew the one thing that they could get Daniel act and you know the scripture tells us that Daniel done something three times a day and everybody knew it he had a prayer life you know he was a prayer warrior you know there's a lot of people they don't know what that means well you know and and I find myself lacking in in that you know we all we all can probably do a better job because that's one thing brother brems said we can't do enough of you can't pray enough and you know there was the story and I can't remember who was talking but you know the Stonewall Jackson you know you know there was a man that wrote to General Jackson was was asking the was talking about the scripture where it says pray without ceasing and he said how is it that you can pray all the time he said I find that very difficult to do that and you know what was so amazing was Stonewall Jackson's answer was you know he said that anything that he done revolved prayer you know brother bream tells us the story that he said General Jackson said that I don't open my mouth to drink water if they don't give thanks to God for the water and he said he said it becomes such a such a action he said just as I would pick this up and open my mouth to drink he said that's how natural it was for me to pray for it and you know when he told it Virginia Ella Terry Institutes you know he said before I go into that classroom he said I pray to God that he prepares me to teach those young men and he said I pray for them to learn from me that they've come in the spirit of you know and he said I didn't drop he said I don't drop a letter in the mailbox and he said until I pray for the person that receives it receives it in the spirit that it's sent in he said I don't open a letter he said until I pray to God for him to prepare me for the contents he said everything that I done revolved around God and you know it you know it seems like it seems like a very simple thing to do but you know that's what the devil fights you that you know many times you know people ask brother Branham you know you know how do I get closer to go what's the simple thing to do he said pray and read your Bible but you know that's what that's what the devil wants that's where the devil wants to hinder you it's a simple thing but you know here in fight you at it you know any time you try to do good he wants to be there he wants to hinder you and you know I like that little song you know the Lord will make a way somehow said wind beneath the cross I bow you know because he said you know and he said when I try to do the right thing evils present on every hand anytime you try to do right the devil is going to be right there to stop you but you know you know Daniel he had he had a prayer life with God and he you know he everybody knew what he done and they knew about his God and you know it's so interesting the one when you read in the scripture that when they said well we have that's the only way that we can get to Daniel is through his God through his belief and so you know they went to the king and they said well we have to we want to create this decree you know according to the laws of meze the Medes and Persians you know whatever the King decreed it couldn't be changed it couldn't be altered and so you know when when he brought that for you know here they are they go in there in the first thing they say and the one thing that you find out was and and it stands out to me when you read this story is that Daniel was not part of this committee and you and you would think that you know it just stands out to me that if I was Darius the King and I seen all of these great counselors and presidents and princes and everything like that the head man that's over everybody that's my right-hand man's not there you know you know that's just stood on media why wasn't there you know the first thing you would think that's the first thing that would happen if Darius was there's like where's Daniel but you know he doesn't say that but you know they go in there and as in the modern term you know they stroke his ego you know Oh Great King Darius live forever you know you're so wonderful you know and they know yeah they know how to get to him you know lots of times if you if you pet somebody and you know and you say the right thing and you smooth them and you know stroke their ego and you know everything then all of a sudden sometimes people don't think before they act you know and so here's Darius oh yeah yeah yeah like that what would you like and then all of a sudden well we have this decree we have we have set and counseled together that we want to pass this decree that nobody nobody will pray or consult anybody but you o Great King for 30 days well all of a sudden the King son sounds good yeah I like that when before he had it in his mind that Daniel was such a part of this kingdom that you know I got to put Daniel over everybody and you know when they were doing all that he didn't even come to and say well you know what let me consult Daniel about that he didn't do any of that and so you know he got all wrapped up in his self and he bypassed his right-hand man and then he went right in and said sure let's pass that I think that's a great great law let's do that and then what happens the scripture tells us that when Daniel hears that Darius decreed this law that made him praying to his god illegal the scripture says that Daniel went home and opened up his windows and pulled back the sashes and prayed to God as he had done at every other time and no and no doubt the scripture tells us that the spies were there because they were there to make sure to see Daniel breaking the law but you know what Daniel Daniel didn't change his you know he didn't say well I'm gonna pray to God but I'm gonna pray in the closet you know I'm not you know I'm not going and you know and the thing is is Daniel didn't go out in the street and stand in front of everybody and pray he didn't go with before King Darius and get down on his knees and pray he didn't be he didn't number one he didn't hide from from his convictions neither did he become a show-off but he went before the but as he done every single day was he went before God in his window and done the exact same thing on the roof of his house and went and prayed before God and the spies were there to watch him and they come and told the King Daniels broke your law well you know what then all of a sudden then we find out that the King is now he's all worked up because he realized the mistake he's made because now he's put Daniel in a life-threatening situation and they're really in the thing and you think about it the first thing that Darius thinks is I've just signed Daniels death for it he's a dead man because he's going in he's going in the den of lions and you know and the scripture says that when when Daniel come up to this and then when Darius ceasing you know dead Darius is so worked up but you know the first thing that Darius tells Daniel he tells Daniel he says your God will deliver you had had some confidence in the in the god of Daniel the scripture tells us that Darius when he when he went and told him then he went home and said he didn't eat he didn't sleep nobody done nothing but he prayed all night and he tossed and turned because Daniel had been thrown in the lion's den and what a what a horrible situation that we you know the scripture tells us and brother Branham tells us you know you never sim alone anything that you do that's wrong you you don't sin by yourself and you know we and you all will fight all the way through the scripture you'll find anybody that breaks God's rule it comes down it's calamity you don't just you don't do it by yourself you know so many times we we look through all the way through the scripture and we see all all the ones there's so many people that are that in the scripture you know that we that we see that when they come to these places you know they why it's so important for us to consult God with every decision that we make but you know here's here's Daniel you know when he goes in the lion's den and brother Branham says you know what you know it's just like when we had a wooden the three Hebrew children were cast in you know they were on a death march and you know when they went on this death march you know the people that went before them died and the people that tried to put them in the in the furnace died you know they make the furnace hotter but you know and you know you know you it was so amazing because you know they went out there and they said well this is this was the decree but you know we don't care our God's more than able to deliver us but if he don't you know we're not going to change your mind we still believe what the Bible says what the Word of God says and we're still not going to bow we're still going to change our way of living and here's Daniel you know I don't think you know when they when they threw Daniel in you know I don't think Daniel was calling the walls I don't think they had to tie Daniel up to throw him in you know they didn't you know they didn't have to you know beat and force him in no I think I think he was ready to go and your brother branham tells us in the message God hath provided a way you know brother brendham says he let Daniel hear the roar of the lion maybe his hot breath right against him that Lions were with their mouths open hungry down in this pit and the Lions rushed right at him and with a great roaring blast till they were ready to seize on to Daniel so right up until the time not only did he throw in but I mean right there they were right on top of him he said all at once he was covered with an angel amen lights swirled around him no doubt it but it was the pillar of fire that led the children of Israel he said God because he says God is a consuming fire suit you know there he was so you know it it didn't just you know you know God just didn't allow you know have this circle around Daniel when he went in no he got the he got to get the full effect of it he got to go through the whole thing but you know what God was there with him and you know many times we wonder why things happen the way they do and we see things how bad they have to get but you know those things happen because God wants us to put our faith in him not to have faith in us or see confidence in and other things you know you know it's just like you know another another story that in the in the Old Testament you know David you know when when we go back to the the Old Testament there in 1st Samuel you know if the children of Israel had to fight the Philistines many times and you know what was so amazing you know I wasn't one battle I think its first samuel chat but you know it talks about there was thirty thousand men were killed the Philistines over them the children of Israel and thirty thousand men were killed in one time in one battle but you know what you go back and you read right after that and it you read right after that and you know what the children of Israel in another battle and then they win another battle and then they take the Ark of the Covenant and you know God smoked them and they give back the Ark of the Covenant and you know all the things that they were just continuing the the fighting that went on between the Philistines and the of the children of Israel well you see all of these dis fighting going on and then and then when they can continues and you know we find out that the children of Israel win another battle and they win another battle and then all of a sudden so it's not like the the Philistines overrun them all the time but you know they did lose too but you know what they had a hero the Philistines brought their you know Goliath came out to them you know he was their hero he was their superstar he was he was to everything it were the whole Philistine army was wrapped up in that one man and you know he went out there and and it was so amazing the the one man that shit'll went out there to fight Goliath was Saul Saul of the solar salts should have been the one to fight that man but you know he didn't and say instead of fighting you know he stayed back and you know the one thing that solder Psalm didn't create any kind of faith he didn't create any kind of courage he didn't do anything to them but he created a whole Atmos a fear and he led Goliath stand out there and continually call for them and you know you know it's such a psychological warfare you know they talk about the the Battle of the Alamo and how Santa Anna when he had the Alamo surrounded you know he kept playing the same tune and you know all of the psychological warfare things that he'd done to those people we don't hear that here they are these people you know they've seen God move on the scene before and fight the same battle yeah it was the same people that they thought before God had defeated the flesh things before and here it is one more time and yet and yet they they let their their surroundings dictate to them what was going to take place you know here's here's the men it was head and shoulders above everybody the men that that Israel wanted for King and he was afraid you know and and you know what kind of what kind of God you know or King is this this is the person that you wanted to rip didn't you they turned they turned the prophet Samuel down and they bring this great man in and he can't do anything for them but here's here's David you know David passed all that by hey you know David come out there and totally listen I don't care what you have that that you have to say I know what God's done for me you know and he had a whole different mindset and you know he wasn't testified to saw what God had done for him what God had done what he had seen God do he didn't worry about what took place and you know when he went past all of that you know Saul wanted to you know train him and mold him into his own image and you know let me give you some armor let me know I don't need any of that let me tell you what God's done for me let me show you what God is because God's been faithful to me he said when I was on the back sheep on the backside of the desert nobody was there but me and God you know what God showed me God showed me that this little slingshots deadly that's all I need is that little slingshot it'll do the job and so you know when he went out there you know he went out there and he took on the life you know everybody else was afraid but you know he said well I'm gonna I'm gonna do what I do because he said you can't you know he said you send me a doll glass said you send me a dog you send me this little little ruddy fella that's that's the best you got and he said listen he said you come at me and if we throw your armor and cursing me and all the names of your gods and everything he said you made a mistake he said the battle is not mine they said I'm just representing one I'm just hearing representation of one he said you defied God you said you defied the Living God the armies of God he said this battle is not mine but he said I'm gonna be the one that God's going years why because it's just being faithful to what God said and he went out there and you know he didn't have to fight he just had to do what he what he knew what to do wound up that little sling there that rock killed a man killed the Goliath the giant their hero and it's the same way with you and I you know many times we going around the same mountain so many times we fake that we fight the same battle and you know what if God's done it one time you know what he's gonna do it again if you if you God has ever met your need one time whatever it is if you meet him in the same conditions he said he's got to do it again if he's ever done it for one he's got to do it again you know so many times we think well you know I'm I'm praying for healing and I'm believing for my healing on whatever it is and you know one day we wake up and and whatever it whatever devil you want a name you know if it's sugar diabetes and your Sugar's shooting through-the-roof one day and it's bottoming out the next whatever it is and you can't control it in that and the doctor so what we got to do this or or whatever else so we're gonna change your medicine or or whatever the problem may be you know what the Word of God never changed and if he said and by my stripes you're healed he said so though it's a finished work well you know if you know and many times we've gone to places where you know we don't wait you don't see a way well God touches you one time and he touches your diabetes and you know it goes and your body's fine within the next day you know then he's attacking you again well you know what it's just like a boxer you know it's just like a boxer you know many times when you went up when a boxer is fighting you know he's he's throwing one punch and he's trying to set you up you know because when you study a boxer you know you know it's just like throwing a punch you know you sometimes I just throw a punch just to get you to move just to see how you're gonna react to it but you know the other punches on this daily that's the one he wants to punch you with well you know the thing is the same way with the Word of God is if you if you've lined up the devil and you keep punching you know what you're gonna knock him out and if you've knocked him out one time then you know what you just keep waiting because it's going to come the time you're gonna knock him out again the problem is is you've got to keep fighting you got to be faithful to the Word of God you got to keep punching the devil well because if he keeps coming at you then you got to keep coming back at him because you know the thing is if we ever give up and you know many times we get down and we get discouraged but the thing is is you got to keep fighting you still got to keep going and so the thing is is you got to keep walking the same road that you've been continuing only just continue on that the same simple message that same simple walk and you know what you'll meet God there one because he's gonna meet you there you know it didn't stop Daniel because he just kept going on kept praying the same thing that he had always done he just kept on doing it and dead and David went out there and done the exact same thing he went out there and he met Goliath why because he knew what God would do and he was just done what he had done before and if you and if you and I are the same way because you know the same one that found you wherever you were at in your life you know if you were sitting on a Pew every day of your life and you just sit in church and you said in church and you said in church and you heard brother branham all your life and you and you knew everything ever since you were knee-high to a grasshopper you knew brother branham was a prophet but it never was real to you that you know the thing is is one day God had to cross your path and touch your heart and open your eyes to understand that you know you need a Savior and if it didn't matter if he was in a Catholic Church he's on a barstool wherever you were at wherever weary God found you God had to cross your path and bring eternal life to you to bring it to you so that you could see it because the first thing you got to do you've got to see it before you can receive it and the thing is is wherever you were at hey if he brought it to you and you know the thing is is if it was just if you just justification if it was just justification then you know what just because he come by your way and brought you justification then you know what that automatically sets you on a journey to sanctification because you know what whatever it may be whatever God has brought you to then you know what if you keep looking and you keep desiring then God's automatically gonna start bringing you to something else god god never hold you back the only thing the hinders God is us is our unbelief we're the only ones that hold God back while God wants us to get ourselves out of the way so that he can minister so that he can move but we stand in the way but I want to be found faithful what's faithful what God told me to do but walk by faith and not by sight to pray and seek his face and he said he'd hear from we'd hear from heaven he'd speak to us but do we keep doing that just keep just keep pressing keep pressing be faithful and what God has called us to you know many times we end up you know brother Branham said that you know everybody likes those mountaintop experiences you know he talks about Mount Sinai and Mount Carmel and all the different ones he said everybody likes a mountaintop experience he said but you know what you never can grow up there he said real growth takes place in the valley he said you got to go through some valleys in your life and so you know we have to go through these hard times you know just like that's where you know David met Goliath he had to go in a valley in a low place you know that's where God wants us to be at sometimes why because that's where we actually stand we can see where God comes and ministers to us and gives us what we have need of now here in this here in the scriptures back in Daniel chapter 6 and it says in verse 10 says now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed he went into his house and his windows being opened in his chamber toward Jerusalem he kneeled down kneeled upon his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God as he did a four time then these men assembled and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God then they came near and spake before the king concerning the Kings decree hast thou not de signed a decree that every man that that shall ask a petition of any God or man within 30 days save the O king shall be cast into the den of lions he answered said the thing is true according to laws of bees and Medes and Persians it's all turth not so verse 14 says and when the king when he heard these things were sore displeased with himself and he said his heart on Daniel to deliver him and he and he labored till the going down of the Sun to deliver him then these men assembled unto the king and said unto the King know o king that the law of the Medes and Persians is that no decree or statute which the king establishes may be changed then the king commanded that they brought Daniel and cast him into the den of lions now the King spake and said unto Daniel thy God whom thou service continually he will deliver the in a stone was brought and set upon the mouth of the den and the King sealed it with his own signet and with the signet of his lords that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel says then the King went to his palace and passed the night fasting neither was there instruments of music brought before him and his sleep went from him then the King arose the rose very early in the morning and went in haste in unto the den of lions and when he came unto the den he cried with a lentil more lamentable voice unto Daniel and the King spake and said unto any old Daniel servant of the Living God is like God then thou service continually able to deliver thee from the lambs then said Daniel unto the king Oh King live forever my God has sent his angel and has shut the lion's mouth and they have not hurt me for as much as before him in its NSE in its in it in its in see who tongue tester tongue-twister yeah most the time I can talk I don't know amen amen what's found in me and also before the Oh King have I done know heard then this then was the King exceeding glad for him and commanded that they should not take they should take Daniel up out of the den so Daniel was taken up out of the den a no matter of hurt was found unto him because he believed in his God and the king commanded and they brought those men which had accused Daniel and they had cast cast them into the den of lions them and their children and their wife say you don't send by yourself and the Lions had the mastery of them and break all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den so Daniel went in and obviously made it to the bottom and they come at him but when King Darius made the decree to cast the men in that tried to kill Daniel they didn't make it to the bottom the scripture if you read that or ever they came at the bottom of the DEM said that lions killed the people they were throwing in and breaking their bones before they ever made it to the bottom of the den yo so you know it works amazing how that how that takes place you know we we've we look in the scripture and you know there's times that people you know things happen and it's so amazing that you know when you when you look at that just like the children of Israel when they're when they're crossing the Red Sea and all of a sudden this great miracle takes place and the Seas parted now all of a sudden three and a half million people start walking across dry land and all of a sudden the Egyptian army you know if if my enemies God can do that I would get the thought maybe I shouldn't go that way you know listen I mean usually if you study tactics you don't walk into you know if you see people going a certain way you know many times when when you we talk to soldiers and and people that's this fault and different Wars or whatever you know lots of times they'll see people going a certain way well you know sometimes they think well you know what we're not gonna go that way because you know there's danger there you know just like the little story I don't know if I ever told you the story about the three preachers that were walking across the water the first two started walking across the water and the third one couldn't figure out what was going on and he got over there and they and he took one step and he went up over his head and the second one turned to the first one said do you think we should have told him where the rocks were you know sometimes when there's a certain way you know if you if you don't know where you're going you don't go that way you know sometimes you know they're the you know you talk to the bro you know different ones that served in like Vietnam in different places you don't take that you don't take the trail that looks the easiest you know they're the ones that you know they walk up and take the long way around and you know they take the hardest way why because you know what your enemy's not going to booby-trap the hardest way to go he's gonna booby-trap the easiest path and all of a sudden here they are you know the Egyptian army they're right behind them hey you know they're going across we're going across well you know that's not that's not that's not good warfare but yo there they are going across and all of a sudden when when the children of Israel get across you know what it's death - all of a sudden you know the God holding them back it collapses on them you know many times people set a trap for somebody and you know what in the middle of that trap the person that it's set for is not the person that ends up in the trap and you know even even when you look in the Book of Ruth you know they did you know they said a trap for Mordechai well you know what Mordechai didn't end up in you know all the way through the scripture you find these things why because God delivers them out of and you know God is wanting us to walk with Him walk through these these things and you know what whatever God brings us to we want to be faithful to that to make our way through you know brother Brennan was talking you know he said you know when you when you look at the Word of God you know he was telling one time he said you know I don't care he said he said if my if my clothes you know my clothes match or or nothing he said the one thing I've got he said I want to make sure that my experience match God's Word that's why that's why I would be faithful to that that my experience matches what God says you know Abraham Lincoln said one time and he was during the Civil War he had a head and advisor to him in you know me at many of you've heard the expression that he said you know he said we're so glad that the Lord's on our side and and Lincoln turned to him and said you know he said he said my concern is not whether God's on my side or not he said he said my greatest concern is to be on God's side he said because God's always right he said that's what I want to be where God said I want to be what God's doing because God whatever God's doing is right I could be wrong you know Lincoln said one time you know he said he said you know there's there's a pretty good chance he got to people arguing he said one of us gonna be wrong he said you know people people trying to argue and he said he said how can you have people praying on both sides fighting the same thing and he said God can't be for something and against some and people arguing over the same thing and you know you know brother branham said you know here you got that you've got one group on this side one group on this side and here they are arguing back forth of who's right who's wrong and then you know brother brems says well let me just stand in the middle you know because people people make that make this assumption that's this sometimes very wrong that you know if you're wrong automatically right well sometimes you know we find out - both of them are wrong you're wrong and I'm wrong because you know if I've got an opinion you got opinion we run the real risk of both of us being wrong but you know what that what does God say what does God's Word say you know do we walk the same way that God wants us to walk that's what that's what we have to do can we walk the same way that God's walking you know do we follow the way God wants us to do you know because if we try to figure things out on our own we don't get anywhere we can't figure it out it was just like brother Graham tells the story about the Jeffersonville Fire Department I'm pretty pretty familiar with everybody but you know he jokes about the Jefferson Fire Department comes to fight this big fire and the man's out there spray a little water here spray a little water there and then he said he said the Clarksville Fire Department comes in their spray a little water here spray a little water there he said you know what he said they brought trained men in real men know how to fight a fire knew what they were doing and he said the first thing they done he said the fire chief was up the ladder as soon as they threw the ladder up he was up there and told him said come on boys knock the wind out went right in he said didn't take long the fire was out why because it took somebody who knew what they were doing you know thing is you know he said many times it's just like preachers that you have preachers that you know that you know if you if you don't follow God's plan you say you spray a little water here spray a little water there you know what you're not going to get anywhere why because you got to get to the root of the problem you got to get to the down to the very root you got to get to the base of it and that's what this this other fire burner he was able to do and you know what God won't says don't get a weekend we can march around and and try to do things in ourselves but wouldn't ever get there but you know what God he wants us to get down to the root of the problem you know what God can find the root well because the scripture says the Word of God is quick and powerful with sharper than any two-edged sword and it's a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart so he knows what the heart of the matter is and he can get to that point and you know the thing is is we want to you know have have a great thing take place but you know God wants us to walk the way he wants us to walk he wants us to walk the journey that we walk you know Braille Ramblers I think some somebody was talking to brother Branham one time and they asked him said brother Brown what you think about this you know juvenile delinquency problem and you know asking about juvenile delinquency and he said well one juvenile delinquency sperry delinquency you know everybody wants to beat on the children well it's all your fault so your oh no lots of times you said it's the parents fault well because if the parents and parents are more responsible than the kids are because if you don't train them up if you don't stay up because you know you're you have to be there Holy Ghost you have to be the one that oversees them and leads them and guides them until until they're accountable for themselves but you know if we don't do that that we can't you can't hold anybody else responsible but for yourself you know sometimes it's like you know what's wrong with you well sometimes if you look at the parents that's that's where your answer is that well that's what that's what I see because you know what you can't you if you anything that you say or you try to do you the thing is you've got to do it in the and the understanding and to the Spirit of God you've got to have the Lord working in the situation because you know you can you can do more damage than you do good you know that's tonight when I was when I was getting ready Adam he likes to ask me so well you don't preach on that daddy where you gonna preach on what you gonna preach other say they didn't know I was gonna talk about this not but I am and Mike's know where you preaching though wait for it so I told I'm gonna preach on the little boys and don't listen that's when I'm gonna preach on I'm gonna preach on the little boys I don't listen well all of a sudden he's older brother jumps up yeah yeah yeah and all of a sudden the other ones going yeah yeah and so they're back and forth at each other going yeah so you see you do this and you do this well I know it and all of a sudden they start giving percentages why listen 74 75 percent of the time well I like ninety no 95 no 99 percent of the time and it's like no you know yeah I do but you know what sometimes we you know God don't want on don't want us to come up there and say well Lord you know what I'm doing ninety-nine point nine percent if you're not sold out all the way you know what don't tell God how good you are cuz you know what God God don't care about your goodness because he ain't looking at your goodness he don't need any of that the only thing we can do is come before God in time Lord we need we need help because you know what we can't do it in ourselves God don't want us try to keep scoreboard you know many people that they spend more time interested in knowing what everybody else is doing and trying to keep score on everybody else you know the thing is is you know I hope you hope y'all don't mind go go ahead thank you brother you know that was a man years and many many years ago and some of y'all probably know the song but you know the man says you know he said if you mind your own business he said then you won't be mind in mine and that may be the bad song to be singing it told about in church but you know what to send them it's correct you know what if you know people if we spend less time talking to each other about everybody else's problems or trying to analyze everybody else you know the only person you ought to be talking to about everybody else's problems in the church you ought to be talking to God if you ain't talking to God about everybody else's problems you ain't got no business talking to nobody but you know what we try to figure out whatever well I don't like the way that person does well you know what that ain't your problem if you ain't you know what the first thing to do if you ain't got on your knees and pray for somebody before you got up and said anything then you know what you don't need to say nothing you know what I get so irritated with people sometimes it just rubs me wrong yes sir I'm just gonna I'm just gonna say how I feel but you know you know you know it's so it's so amazing you know because you know we live we live in a godless generation we live we live in an absolute godless world and you know you know the you know the people the people that you know because you know what it's it's not the person sitting down here in the in the bar somewhere that's the problem it's not the person in in some in some house of ill-repute somewhere that's the problem it's the problem there's somebody that actually says there are Christian and tries to put fingers at people and you know what they got so many skeletons in their closet nobody wants to look well the scripture tells us you know while we trying to pull a speck out of our brothers eye when we got a beam in ours but we don't want to deal with the beam that might be off the subject but that's just the way I feel one because you find people that believe this message you know what if we're if we believe this message and we need to be sold out to this message we've got to be faithful to what the Prophet said it didn't matter whether whether it makes us over the coals or it hurts our feelings or whatever else you know we've got to be faithful to what God's called us to and you know the thing is is everybody collects two folk the scripture where brother the quote where brother Branham says yeah well you know you know you know you better not shout you better not jump too high if you fall to come back down you better better walk straight line don't jump no higher than you can live well you know what the problem is is nobody nobody and I don't believe in living right I don't believe it I don't leave no greasy grace or nothing else but there's one thing about it is when you try to measure everybody by your experience and by your yardstick that ain't no none of your business you know God measures somebody and you know and if we ever if we ever got to the place you know because there's times people want to say things and and and people don't realize this that if you say things and your mind and sometimes people say things and that you might have the right intention what's being said but you know what if you don't pray over it and seek God's face before you say something sometimes people take take offense at what you're saying and you've hurt somebody and you know the thing is people don't realize that what you're saying is actually doing more harm than good if we just if we just wait on the Lord can we just wait on the Lord and say what the Lord wants us to say Lord let us to be faithful to you the scripture tells us to judge not lest we be judged well let's be it let's you know the thing is is do we approach everything the right way because you know you know if you find a brother in a fault if you can find if you can find me a scripture on how to handle that you know not not the way some people handle it but if you can if you I would I'd like to see that because you know the scripture tells me if you find a brother in the fault you're supposed to go to him and try and try to restore that one I hadn't found one yet where you're supposed to if you find a brother in the fault where you're supposed to put him under he'll I don't know what your problem is or grabbing by the shirt collar what's your problem you don't get anybody that way you don't help anybody that way let's let's be faithful to what God called us to you know if we if if we if we show the love of God because if the love of God's been shown to us whatever you went through when we were in sins and trespasses and we didn't have anything and we were nothing in this world but we were lost in sin separated alienated from God and you know what the love of God come to us and you know that's all the way that you're ever going to store one is by the love of God to have to help someone that you've got to be able to help someone that way and know that brethren said you can't help someone if you don't know how to feel for that person if you can't be in their shoes if you don't know the situation they're in you're never going to help anybody and that's what I want to do I want to be found faithful to what God is cause I want to be a person that shows the love of God that I can restore something that I can help somebody because you know what many times in this world you you find a lot of people and you said you see that the things that happen to people and they don't see anybody they don't see any help well you know that's a shame that the people that go to the house of God can't find help if you can't and you know the thing is is you don't have you don't have to Pat them on the back and you know just go along we'll know but you know what you can be you can be there for them you can stand there you can pray for them and you know what you can encourage somebody and but you got to correct them in love the scripture tells us to reprove rebuke exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine and many times people have forgot that on how to rebuke reprove to exhort somebody they just want to rebuke somebody but you know there's a time you got to build people up you got to encourage somebody you've got to know how to deal with these things that he's quit preaching he started meddling but you know what you know it's and then and then yes but why are you talking about this well you know you know you look at the world today and you know especially you look at kids today and and it seems like it doesn't go a week and you find some kid that's on the news somewhere and it's there they're bullied you know you say you see all these kids and you the first thing you read about here's some kid and they hung themselves you find a kid that's bullied and you know and and they they went out and done whatever and they end up killing themselves they end up taking medicine or whatever else to kill themselves people who they've taken guns and shot themselves and you know the first thing you start reading about their lives and you know they can't find anybody that's on their side well you know what you're not you can't help anybody like that but you know because so many people have because they're looking for a God with skin and you know what you and I are that God to reach these people that people you know because years ago we went to Richard on my sisters we went to a Christian school and there was these little girls that were in the Christian school and they had come from a really messed-up family and you know one of the questions was they had to answer who loved that you know they were they wanted somebody and you know the only person that those kids knew that that loved them that they that they had love from was their teacher nobody that when they went home nobody that they lived with they felt that they had love they had any kind of affection from but it was this Christian lady in the school and she said that's the person that loves me that's love and you know many times you know we can feed kids we can clothe them we can do a lot of things but you know what they need to know that they're loved that they're supported and you know you can you can the scripture tells us you know we can we can take care of the natural needs of a person but you know what we need to be as a body of Christ we have to stand behind each other and support each other in this in a spiritual realm to know that people hate I know you know because it is you know sometimes you feel like you know I'm on an island by myself but you know the thing is it's nice when you get a phone call or something and you and somebody you know because the greatest you can do many things UK you can see miracles take place or different things but you know one of the one of the greatest things that's ever happened in my life is when I pick up the phone and I'm able to call somebody because they're on my heart and I tell them I say listen I don't know what you're going on I just want to let you know I love you I prayin for you you just been on my heart or whatever and all of a sudden they're out there and they're and you know they're thinking I'm on an island by myself I'm fighting whatever I'm fighting and I'm trying to fight this battle by myself and you know what it's great to know that we have a Heavenly Father that's on our side and many times when we think we're going all by ourselves just like Elijah said you know Lord I'm all by myself he said no I got 7,000 more that's never bow to me well you know I tell you what brother scissors it's the same way with you and ice it's wonderful that you can touch somebody and you know be the instrument that God uses to touch somebody's life that's what I want to be I want to be the instrument that touches their life why because I've had people touch mine and that's what I want to be I want to be faithful what God's called us to you know if I have to go through if I do if I live nothing but in valleys or whatever God wants me to do what I just want to be faithful to that god help us to be faithful to the word that he's called us to you know what it's not you're not ever gonna conquer anything in a day but you know you got to be faithful to the fight to the climb just keep fighting keep climbing and you've reached you'll reach that place amen god bless you tonight let's all stand we're gonna have the musicians coming just you ever need to nut this thing if you have a need you know you don't if you want Prairie you can come but you know what you talk to God right where you're at God can meet you right where you're at tonight amen let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father or Jesus are just so thankful ordered Lord your faithful to us great is thy faithfulness as the scripture says Lord Jesus we're so thankful that you've been faithful to us all along the way lord help us that that we can be more faithful to you Lord let us just Lord and everything that we do Lord Lord as we look in your Scripture Lord Jesus we want to be more like you and everything that we do or does as the song says I want to be so much like you the world can't tell us apart and nobody can tell us apart that they see Jesus Christ in us or Jesus because we can do many things in this world but Lord if we if we're not if we're not manifesting you lord if we're not showing the world you or we're not doing anything and Lord just help us and I just take these words Lord Jesus that are all jumbled up Lord or just take them Lord in or just speak to each heart tonight Lord Jesus and use them Lord that it'd be a blessing to the people Lord Lord whatever it takes Lord that we can do Lord that's what we want to do or do whatever you have to do to us Lord to mold us and make us whatever into your iam is Lord to be more like you that's what we want to do Lord come well we just commit ourselves to your hands Lord or demote us and do everything that needs to

Reiter it's a that is greater is He that is in me to receive a man I bless you tonight as we get ready to go I will study Saturday night amen just so thankful the Lord what he's done for us you know you know you I was listening brother Brennan and I've been listening to brother Dale's just seals I I try to listen to him regular basis continually go through him and you know you know brother Brennan was talking about the the Jews you know the the grace of God to the Jews was you know it's kind of hard to imagine that being you know brother branham said it was that hinder hand of Jehovah and you know he said all those demonic forces those two hundred thousand thousand demons being loosed on them and he said he was to drive them back to their homeland and you know it you know you contemplate that but you know brother Bentham said in the last stage you know that was poured out on the bride and you know you know me time school you know it sometimes you go down the road you and you think you know sometimes you know we look at the grace of God and sometimes we don't realize what the grace of God he is that's the love of God that you know he's poured that out to bring us to the word whatever it takes to get us there and that's that's that's the love of God because he's bringing us to a place how many times we look when we think you know you know it's just like trying to you know sometimes when you raise your kids and you and you see in and you know they think they think you're horrible they think you're mean you're terrible but you know one of these days they look back and they think universal love and you know we look at things and we wonder why we go through things and you know you you don't like it at the time but you know it's the grace of God and you how much God loves us and you know it's such a wonderful thing that we to know the depth of God's love sometimes we don't it's kind of hard to understand it but it's so great when God lets us sometimes see just a part of that to realize just how low we are and you know I just want to thank him every day for that let's thank you and I love him because he first loved me amen well god bless you hope you have a wonderful week and we'll we're we'll meet back on Saturday for a while studying so this is all bow our heads and we're gonna ask brother call if he doesn't mind dismiss us in a man no bless you dismissed [Music]
