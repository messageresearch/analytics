[0:00] I know I put this book together very
[0:10] quickly this morning so I was in heaven
[0:17] nothing best nervous it wasn't there I
[0:21] thought my gosh wait what's that did you
[0:30] go home that's right so this morning I
[0:36] want to start off by doing something a
[0:39] little different
[0:40] I want to um you know we tell him to
[0:43] talk about this morning the marriage of
[0:45] the lamb with the whole purpose of
[0:48] what's been going on through the seven
[0:50] churches and what's been going over our
[0:52] individual losses that we're being go
[0:54] through the process of marriage to Jesus
[0:56] Christ and part of that part of that is
[0:59] that you the bride isn't making herself
[1:01] ready there's there's something that
[1:04] groom as a dude or something that the
[1:06] bride has to do and the bride's role is
[1:09] to make yourself ready so to make
[1:11] yourself ready you got to eat the word
[1:12] right you have to have a relationship
[1:14] with God and so I wanted to spend a few
[1:17] minutes talking about how to make you
[1:19] separate but you know years ago
[1:22] the message was on real burials and and
[1:26] it was very comes had to load up that
[1:28] reel and and of course I don't know all
[1:31] the things that went into that
[1:35] so you know it as time goes on it gets
[1:39] easier and easier to get into the
[1:41] message I remember when uh when his name
[1:48] mispronounces he they came out with that
[1:50] little little thing where you could see
[1:53] all the messages all of them on that
[1:55] little tiny little device with that
[1:57] little screen and you could search and
[1:59] everything and people
[2:00] yeah the e-book and uh and so now we're
[2:04] even come along further than that but a
[2:07] lot of people don't realize how easy it
[2:09] is you know you almost you know you've
[2:11] got all these books and things on your
[2:13] shelf and you don't have to necessarily
[2:14] I mean I still like to have a book that
[2:17] you pull out and it's got highlighted
[2:19] and everything but you don't have to do
[2:21] that so I think everybody just about has
[2:24] a computer and inside this more to share
[2:26] with you real quick if you go to Branham
[2:28] that over which is the voice of God
[2:30] website and then go up to the top of the
[2:33] page here and click home multimedia apps
[2:39] click on apps right there
[2:41] and they've got some apps that you can
[2:43] download and one of them is this neat
[2:45] table app now this is a little leap so
[2:48] to get it on your computer you just
[2:50] click on Windows and it downloads this
[2:52] little program that you can see here in
[2:54] my and my Google Chrome tray and you
[2:56] just run this program and it installs it
[2:58] and if you need any help if you got a
[3:01] laptop or whatever and you want to get
[3:02] this on your computer any of these
[3:05] brothers around here myself included
[3:07] would be glad to help you get it
[3:08] installed and so this is a little
[3:10] slimmed down version of that on that app
[3:12] that you can get on your phone which in
[3:14] fact does basically the same thing you
[3:17] think about how amazing that is you can
[3:18] have all the messages on your phone and
[3:20] if you've got any downtime you can just
[3:22] pull up your phone and you something
[3:25] pops in you buy one for I'm sad about
[3:27] this and you go search it in and and you
[3:30] know it's very important for ministers
[3:33] to have something that you can search
[3:35] but also for this antibody to be able to
[3:38] search and check things out and and and
[3:41] make sure that
[3:42] you know keep your own little library of
[3:44] things that you find interesting or
[3:46] whatever so so this app if you when you
[3:50] open it up it looks like this
[3:52] Wow every single message is right there
[3:56] and you all you have to do is just click
[3:58] through you can find a message by the
[4:01] time that brother man preached you find
[4:04] it oh you know I buy the location you
[4:07] click this little search icon and you
[4:10] click there and you can find all the all
[4:13] the times brother Grimson predestinate
[4:15] or predestinated or participates and go
[4:18] through and see everything that he's
[4:20] said and then even you know click over
[4:22] here and you can you select words and
[4:28] then you can highlight you know keep
[4:32] your own little little record of things
[4:34] categories that you create you know
[4:38] what's really amazing is that they have
[4:40] taken their they once of God has done is
[4:43] they've taken the when they when they
[4:45] send this over to see store the
[4:46] translators and the reason I know this
[4:48] has come up my father knows that is a
[4:52] translator for Romania and they mark up
[4:57] all of these paragraphs with a little
[5:00] you know each and you can see how they
[5:02] as you highlighted it it note it's got
[5:04] these little ranges so you can click
[5:06] anywhere in this software and just start
[5:09] playing if you want to hear how exactly
[5:12] brother branham saying it just click it
[5:14] and play it and it starts playing right
[5:17] there
[5:19] and how amazing is that so I'm just I
[5:22] just wanted to share that with you
[5:23] because a lot of people are not aware
[5:25] that that is that's available and that
[5:27] you can really dig into the message and
[5:29] find out what the rim say for yourself
[5:31] and keep your own little catalog of you
[5:35] know I sometimes with my wife and I
[5:36] obviously you know put in something here
[5:39] like like adoption or predestinate
[5:43] something like that and just go through
[5:45] brother Evan said about it and read it
[5:48] one at a time and and you can even see
[5:51] in it and have the progression of the
[5:52] thought from the beginning of the
[5:54] ministry all the way through kinda helps
[5:57] put things in context gives you you know
[6:00] you can you can see how how brother
[6:02] Brennan framed it in early early in the
[6:03] ministry how the continuity of it goes
[6:06] all the way through the whole message
[6:07] and I think one of the things that's
[6:10] kind of surprising is how how the little
[6:12] brother branham did change things from
[6:14] the beginning that you know he may be
[6:16] able to he expressed adoption and things
[6:18] a little bit differently then you did
[6:21] later on the ministry but it's an
[6:23] unchanging message so anyway I just want
[6:28] to share that week and now let's go on
[6:30] into the topic the marriage of the Lamb
[6:33] but before I do that is they might have
[6:35] any questions about software how to get
[6:37] something anything like that it's pretty
[6:42] cool just to listen to messages to type
[6:44] it up and then push play if I don't have
[6:47] been in my life already pushed down load
[6:48] it down with my probably a minute yes
[6:51] yeah it's fantastic and then they also
[6:55] have this this this is the really
[6:58] powerful software that a lot of people
[7:00] use that that that you can order from
[7:02] the element it comes on the CDs and you
[7:04] can load it up and this allows you to do
[7:06] fantastic things like if I if I want you
[7:12] DEP see I was doing a little complex
[7:14] search right there you can search for
[7:16] predestinate and it put a little star on
[7:18] the end of it and it'll search for
[7:19] predestinate pretty studied in it'll do
[7:22] standing on it so you can if you don't
[7:24] know exactly how brother I'm said it you
[7:26] just put that little a trick in there
[7:27] and you can do some really powerful
[7:29] searches and that's not available with
[7:32] that little slate
[7:33] down software and then you can search
[7:36] for phrases you can do phrase and then
[7:39] have another word that he might have
[7:40] searched said and so it really helps to
[7:44] find things
[7:54] all right so the marriage of the labor
[8:02] you know the marriage of the lamb is is
[8:04] something that like I said it's
[8:06] something that's taking place where God
[8:07] is peace he's uniting himself with the
[8:11] bride that has been chosen has been
[8:13] pulled out of all of the denominational
[8:15] systems and been United with him
[8:17] and there's a process that takes place
[8:19] if you look at really I want to talk
[8:22] this morning about the Jewish wedding
[8:24] the traditional Jewish wedding all the
[8:26] things that go into that but if you look
[8:28] at how the wedding takes place that is
[8:31] mirrored in the church and so one of the
[8:34] things we're talking about isn't it the
[8:36] green has some things that he's got to
[8:38] do and the bride has some things that
[8:40] she has to be there's some some parts
[8:42] that she has to play in one of those
[8:44] things that she has to get ready so
[8:46] that's why I was sharing with you how to
[8:48] get ready how to go dig into the word
[8:50] for yourself was one of the things that
[8:52] the bride doesn't get her separator she
[8:54] goes to church she studies he reads the
[8:56] Bible from herself all those things make
[8:58] up getting ready I'm gonna start off I
[9:04] don't know where that that word glory
[9:07] came from that's just now notice that
[9:12] almost the copied and pasted that
[9:14] somewhere else but anyway so in Genesis
[9:17] chapter 6 it talks about that the the
[9:22] daughters their sons of God saw the
[9:24] daughters of men that they were fair and
[9:25] they joined themselves to me they got
[9:27] they got married they took them wives
[9:29] which they chose and they joined
[9:31] themselves based on them they you know
[9:36] brother Graham talk about how they're
[9:37] the sons of God or not it wasn't that
[9:39] the angels came down and doing
[9:42] themselves to the to the dollar to mean
[9:44] because it's about angel does not have
[9:46] any and I'm not only there's no they're
[9:49] not male or female like that so that
[9:51] couldn't have been
[9:52] that and in these so these these were
[9:56] sons of God descendants from Adam that
[9:59] that instead of instead of finding
[10:02] somebody that believed the same thing
[10:04] that they did they wanted to give
[10:06] themselves unequally and the reason what
[10:08] they did was they were looking for
[10:09] somebody that that appeased the outside
[10:12] man
[10:13] somebody that you know dollars are men
[10:16] like Jezebel they may you know fix them
[10:20] fix up their outward appearance showing
[10:24] too much skin problem paired in a way
[10:26] that will be unseemly to attract
[10:28] somebody like that but a real son of God
[10:31] it won't be it shouldn't be attracted as
[10:33] things like that and you can see how
[10:35] this this Union got off it this Union
[10:38] was incorrect and the God's going to
[10:40] join himself to a bride that he's
[10:44] looking for somebody that has the right
[10:46] character the right the right thing to
[10:49] make to you so that he can heal himself
[10:53] equally you see
[10:54] and so what territory is looking for is
[10:56] the character of himself that's how he's
[10:59] choosing he's choosing something that
[11:01] he's choosing a bride that expresses the
[11:03] same thing the same attributes that are
[11:05] in him and so how do we come to a
[11:08] wedding in Matthew 19 with a very famous
[11:11] scripture that we were from anywhere the
[11:13] the Pharisees came to him tempting him
[11:15] and he answered instead of a I mean I
[11:17] did not read that he which he which made
[11:19] them at the beginning made them male and
[11:20] female and said for this cause shall a
[11:22] man leave father and mother and shall
[11:24] cleave to his wife and they twain shall
[11:26] be one flesh one flesh just like Adam
[11:29] and Eve or one flesh following his bone
[11:32] everything matched up word just like the
[11:35] bride and Christ's word word matching up
[11:38] the spirit the same spirit the same Holy
[11:40] Ghost those in Jesus's and the bride
[11:42] everything matches up they see swear for
[11:45] there are no more Twain but one flesh
[11:47] what they're for
[11:48] together let not man put asunder so I if
[11:54] a man and a woman gets bared and it's
[11:56] truly a guardian to governments join
[11:58] them together let not man put that thing
[11:59] asunder the same thing with a bride when
[12:02] the bride and Christ are joined together
[12:05] it's not something that has been
[12:07] produced by man but God has done that
[12:09] work let not man put asunder and then in
[12:17] Matthew chapter 22 sorry Jesus is
[12:22] talking about the wedding so let's just
[12:24] read this one just I'll just take my
[12:26] time and go through some of these
[12:28] scriptures the kingdom of heaven is like
[12:30] unto a certain King which made a
[12:32] marriage for his son and sent forth his
[12:34] servants to calling that were bidden to
[12:36] the way and they would not come again he
[12:38] set forth other servants saying tell
[12:41] them which are bidden behold I prepared
[12:43] my dinner my oxen and my fatlings are
[12:46] killed and all things are ready come
[12:48] under the marriage and I will show you
[12:50] in a slide I second all the things that
[12:52] go into a biblical wedding and one of
[12:54] the things that goes into is there's the
[12:56] invitation
[12:56] there's the invitation that come there's
[12:58] a lot of things that go there's got to
[13:00] be a groom a bride and the invitation
[13:01] and a port a porter a door of wedding
[13:05] garment all those things are going to
[13:07] make it of the wedding and then the
[13:10] first thing is that invitation you can't
[13:12] have a wedding without the groom saying
[13:13] we were you marry to me and that's what
[13:16] when you come to church you hear that
[13:18] invitation as the minister about how the
[13:19] pulpit is preaching the gospel he says
[13:21] will you be joined to this man will you
[13:24] take this man and when you when you're
[13:27] saved you're receiving that invitation
[13:28] you see I will and he said but they made
[13:32] a lot of it and went their ways one to
[13:34] his farm another to his merchandise and
[13:36] the rim that took his servants and
[13:37] entreated them spitefully and slew him
[13:39] but when the king heard thereof he was
[13:41] wroth and he sent forth his armies to
[13:42] destroy those murder
[13:43] burned up their city then saith each of
[13:46] the service waiting is ready but they
[13:49] which were bidden were not worth worthy
[13:53] good are you therefore into the highways
[13:55] and as many as you shall find bid to the
[13:57] marriage so those servants went out into
[13:59] the highways and gathered together all
[14:01] as many as they found both bad and good
[14:03] and the wedding was furnished with
[14:05] guests and when the king came in to see
[14:08] the guests he saw there a man which had
[14:09] no wedding garment now you see that's
[14:12] another thing that the bride has to do
[14:14] when she comes to the wedding she can't
[14:16] just come up there dress like she just
[14:19] came from the kitchen she's got to come
[14:21] with a wedding dress on she can't just
[14:24] come any other way she's got to come
[14:26] with the veil with the wedding dress
[14:28] with the wedding garment so she's gotta
[14:31] have a wedding garment you see and he
[14:33] saved them to them Freddie how came is
[14:34] down being together not having a wedding
[14:36] garment and he was speechless now that's
[14:39] important thing I want to point out he
[14:41] was speechless because if you're
[14:43] speechless that means you don't know you
[14:44] don't have no understanding you don't
[14:46] have nothing to say 'no bride and this
[14:48] day is supposed to have an understanding
[14:49] of awareness of what she's what she's
[14:51] doing here she's that she's heard the
[14:53] word and she understands she has
[14:55] knowledge she's been adopted she knows
[14:58] exactly what the message is taken to her
[15:00] and she has a voice because I believe
[15:03] that the voice of God is in the bride
[15:05] she's able to speak like Esther did when
[15:08] she went into the Kings she was able to
[15:09] speak and anything and explain and so
[15:13] this person here is speechless they
[15:16] don't have a clue they don't know they
[15:18] don't unable to give a reason they're
[15:20] unable to say well I didn't do it
[15:22] because of them so because of that
[15:23] they're not I'm not able to explain
[15:25] anything then said the King to the
[15:27] servants bind him hand and foot and take
[15:29] him away cast him out into outer
[15:31] darkness there shall be weeping
[15:33] gnashing of teeth for many are called
[15:35] but few are chosen and I have a quote
[15:38] I'll show you gonna hit a little bit
[15:40] about what brother branham explained
[15:42] about it come on me and brother that
[15:46] that is a that is a very horrible
[15:49] condition to realize to get to the place
[15:52] to realize where that you should have
[15:56] been eating of the word you should have
[15:59] been preparing yourself and you get to
[16:01] the place where the bride is called to
[16:04] the wedding feast the Trump of the Lord
[16:06] sounds and you're you're not ready and
[16:10] to get to come to that place and
[16:14] there'll be a foolish virgin one day
[16:16] there realizes oops I should have been
[16:20] eaten I should have been making myself
[16:22] ready and now I don't have the wedding
[16:25] garment and so it says it would be cast
[16:28] into outer darkness and there should be
[16:29] weeping and gnashing of teeth for many
[16:31] are called but few are chosen of course
[16:35] we know this future in the revelation
[16:37] this is really what I'm talking about
[16:38] the marriage of the land that says and I
[16:40] heard it as it were the voice of a great
[16:41] multitude and as the voice of meeting
[16:43] waters and the voice of mighty
[16:44] thunderings saying how about say
[16:45] hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent
[16:48] reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and
[16:50] give honour together for the marriage of
[16:53] the lamb has come and his wife hath made
[16:55] herself ready the time has come for them
[16:58] to be joined for them for her to be
[17:00] taken out for all the things that are
[17:03] all that all the biblical types and
[17:06] everything to be fulfilled and when the
[17:08] marriage of the lamb has come the wife
[17:11] has made herself free she comes up she's
[17:13] been washed
[17:14] she's been cleaned she's wearing a white
[17:17] garment she's got all of the things all
[17:21] things are set in order the way that
[17:23] they're supposed to be the groom has
[17:25] done his part and the bride has done her
[17:28] part into her was granted that she
[17:30] should be arrayed in fine linen clean
[17:32] and white for the fine linen is the
[17:35] righteousness of saints and he say them
[17:38] to me write blessed are they which are
[17:40] called under the marriage
[17:42] the land many say that I mean these are
[17:44] the true sayings of God so let's look at
[17:47] the parts of the Spirit joining this is
[17:49] what I'm just gonna I'm just going to go
[17:51] through each of these this morning
[17:52] first you got a engine invitation then
[17:56] you've got this thing in the Jewish
[17:57] wedding call it a tuba what is like a
[18:00] tuba we'll look at that for a second
[18:03] then you got a porter somebody's gotta
[18:05] open the door
[18:06] there's the door which we know is Christ
[18:08] somebody's got to be standing there
[18:10] opening the door and and I'm gonna the
[18:12] porter sit down to reach seven church
[18:14] ladies you got us a church a messenger
[18:18] that opens the door and everybody that's
[18:19] in their denominational system can go
[18:21] through the door and come out of that
[18:23] age but you also got ministers cuz you
[18:27] gotta have a wedding you look let's just
[18:31] be really a first thing you can't just
[18:33] put on the tape or something and play a
[18:35] recording and have a wedding ceremony
[18:37] you gotta have a minister standing there
[18:39] that can say things like like is there
[18:43] anybody here that knows any impediment
[18:45] why these two cannot be joined then when
[18:48] you have a wedding you got to make sure
[18:51] there's no impediment there's no reason
[18:53] why you can't be joined together that's
[18:55] why many people don't get the baptism
[18:57] you all a ghost because there's a reason
[18:59] why you can't be joined together the
[19:02] reason might be that you ain't justified
[19:04] you can't be joined together if you're
[19:06] not justified you can't be joined
[19:08] together if you're not sanctified
[19:10] because there's a reason why you can't
[19:12] be joined together but if all of those
[19:14] reasons are out of the way then you can
[19:16] be joined together and you see if so if
[19:19] you come to a wedding and the natural
[19:21] wedding like just two people come to
[19:22] church and and somebody you ask that
[19:24] question somebody stands up well they
[19:27] got a live-in husband well see then the
[19:31] husband that you were you were doing to
[19:33] previously is not dead so there's a
[19:36] reason why you can't be doing the end of
[19:38] it you see so so we got the porter of
[19:41] the door the groom the groom has to play
[19:43] this role the bride
[19:45] you got a gardener and you got a tuba
[19:48] which is the canopy the tuba
[19:51] is this thing in the Jewish wedding that
[19:53] that the bride and the groom will stand
[19:55] under and they they they make their
[19:58] wedding vows under this canopy and
[20:01] you've got to have that canopy to have a
[20:04] spiritual wedding you got to have that
[20:07] place for you to stand under and make
[20:09] your vows and then you have the supper
[20:12] and then the most important part of all
[20:16] from a real spiritual way is love
[20:20] because how are you gonna have a wedding
[20:22] if you don't have a relationship to
[20:24] begin with you gotta have love otherwise
[20:27] you're just going through somebody some
[20:29] stuff and and it just messes everything
[20:33] up if the whole relationship is not
[20:35] based on love in fact there's no there's
[20:38] no relationship at all of that look
[20:40] you've got to have a relationship with
[20:42] God yes that's that's the whole that's
[20:45] the kind of keeping the whole thing so
[20:48] first of all you got to have the
[20:49] invitation in Matthew 24 says in this
[20:51] gospel of the kingdom shall be preached
[20:53] in all the world for a witness unto all
[20:55] nations and then shall the income the
[20:58] engine come when the invitation has been
[21:01] sent to everybody in the world everybody
[21:04] here's the invitation that's one of the
[21:06] criteria for the easy mark 16 says and
[21:11] he said unto them go ye into all the
[21:13] world and preach the gospel to every
[21:15] creature to all the world and that's
[21:18] what happened after after their death
[21:19] Pentecost they stayed around in
[21:21] Jerusalem for a little bit and then a
[21:23] prophet came on the scene I forget his
[21:25] name
[21:25] what nanan eyes but he said he talked
[21:28] about that Titus was gonna come in and
[21:30] destroy the city and so everybody
[21:31] dispersed and then begin to go into all
[21:33] the world when I went to India I forget
[21:36] which one which ones went to different
[21:38] places some went to the England
[21:40] somewhere in two different places and
[21:41] they took the gospel into all the world
[21:43] to preach that invitation to come to the
[21:45] waiting sir
[21:46] Peter believe that is baptized shall be
[21:48] saved
[21:49] say but he that believeth not shall be
[21:50] damned and these signs shall follow them
[21:52] that believe
[21:53] we know all these these promises that of
[21:56] the church that works we'll follow their
[21:58] faith when verse 20 says and they went
[22:00] forth and preached everywhere the Lord
[22:03] working with them and confirming the
[22:05] word with worthless silence following
[22:08] and look for 14 eight through twelve
[22:11] says when they are bidden of any man to
[22:12] a wedding sitting up down in the highest
[22:14] room lest the more honorable man then
[22:16] thou be bidden of him
[22:18] and this is talking about me you've been
[22:20] to the feast in your own self don't try
[22:24] to make yourself up high but keep real
[22:26] humble so that God can build you up with
[22:28] these virtues so that God can can mold
[22:32] you into his image and either faith in
[22:34] him come and say that they give this men
[22:36] place and now begin with shame to take
[22:38] the lowest ring then when that aren't
[22:40] bidden go and sit down in the lowest
[22:42] room that when again had been made thee
[22:44] cometh you may say to thee friend go up
[22:47] higher and higher higher is going to
[22:51] take you all the way to the wedding
[22:52] supper and then shalt thou have worship
[22:55] in the presence of them that sat at meat
[22:56] with thee from whosoever exalteth
[22:58] himself shall be abased and he that
[23:00] humbleth himself shall be exalted so
[23:03] when you're bidding bidden to the when
[23:05] you're invited to the wedding feast
[23:06] accept the invitation with humility and
[23:09] meekness so that you can you so that God
[23:12] can work and work something in you to
[23:14] take you up higher all right so we're
[23:16] talking about the invitation now let me
[23:19] read this list I know we're all for me
[23:22] with this story that program total of
[23:23] the the armored meat packing this story
[23:26] which is a true story it actually
[23:28] happened that the son of one of the men
[23:31] of the armored meat packing he or aunt
[23:34] was actually one of the the foreman of
[23:36] the ranch where the armored meat packing
[23:38] folks had that ranch he he went out and
[23:41] wanted to choose a bride and so program
[23:43] tells the story of the of the choosing
[23:46] of of this man's bride and it compares
[23:49] to how God chooses a bride and if you
[23:52] notice when you look at the story they
[23:53] start off maybe maybe that ranch foreman
[23:56] was
[23:56] dressed up in jeans and and the little
[24:00] girl was was you know she was down on
[24:03] her knees just cleaning the floor or
[24:06] maybe looked all dirty and everything
[24:08] for example just like Rahab just like
[24:11] the woman at the whale started off not
[24:14] dressed far away the man was just come
[24:18] out there wanting to talk to her and
[24:20] everything but then at the end of the
[24:22] story she's dressed she's got a wedding
[24:26] on she's ready for the wedding and he
[24:28] comes riding in with his coach I've said
[24:31] like in a tuxedo he's ready for the
[24:33] wedding - so there's a transformation
[24:36] that takes place through this story
[24:38] the transformation is she's made herself
[24:41] ready and he's got everything prepared
[24:46] he's got her home ready he's done his
[24:48] part he's played this role the so
[24:51] everybody's got their role that they've
[24:52] got a play so he says it reminds me of a
[24:56] little story I might say it before we go
[24:58] on out west here some time ago many
[25:00] years there was this great armour and
[25:01] Swift packing company how they do they
[25:03] come out there buy cattle and buy
[25:05] ranches and they're worth a lot of money
[25:07] about all the small ranches that have
[25:09] millions of acres of ranch like that run
[25:11] these being finally here for cattle in
[25:13] sections their own they own their own
[25:15] railroads and things that brings in
[25:16] kalamoon to another and armor and Swift
[25:19] had a big ranch and one day they had a
[25:21] forum in there the superintendent it was
[25:23] of the ranch he had about four or five
[25:24] dollars and they found out that one of
[25:26] the big armor brothers was or not
[25:28] brothers but sons were going to visit
[25:30] the ranch that he was a young single man
[25:33] and all these girls
[25:37] yeah for sure that was going to vamp
[25:40] this boy as soon as he could see how
[25:43] that ties into that Genesis scripture I
[25:45] read where they the sons of God chose
[25:48] the daughters of me and they chose girls
[25:49] that were vamping but so here these
[25:51] girls thought they were gonna ban this
[25:53] boy like Jezebel trying to evaluate him
[25:56] when he was coming riding on his horse
[25:59] and so they was always getting ready and
[26:02] making sure making everything ready to
[26:03] come when he got there then was going to
[26:05] meet him and put on an old frontier day
[26:07] with their little dresses on with a
[26:09] fringe on it and 45:44 is on each hip
[26:12] and then them hats on the back of their
[26:14] head you know they was going to be
[26:15] regular Westerners and each one of the
[26:18] girls was going to get one of them was
[26:19] going to get this boy and they had a
[26:22] little cousin there that her mother was
[26:23] dead and the father was dead she was a
[26:26] cousin that she almost was the slave
[26:27] doll that was there and all the dirty
[26:29] work she had to do it washing the dishes
[26:31] and everything but she had no clothes
[26:32] she had to take hand-me-downs and so in
[26:35] the time come that the board was to
[26:37] arrive they all got in their book boards
[26:39] and a way down to the station and went
[26:41] to receiving and they were shooting the
[26:43] guns and the horses nicker in and
[26:44] everything and they brought him out to
[26:46] the ranch and that night they had a big
[26:48] shindig and they got out there on the
[26:49] haystacks and the Kuril fence Corral
[26:52] fence and they sang and they danced and
[26:54] all through the night he was there for
[26:55] two or three days so they wasn't dressed
[26:58] for a wedding they were dressed for a
[27:00] Western shindig you see so this is a
[27:04] little girl she had all the rough work
[27:05] to do so when Allah wants the ball of
[27:07] one night was something was over and
[27:08] they had dances and each one of these
[27:10] little girls had printed it up you know
[27:12] and this poor little girl had to have a
[27:13] little ragged dress on and one night she
[27:16] was sitting in the mess hall after the
[27:17] supper was over and she had washed the
[27:19] dishes and she run out through the
[27:20] backyard to throw the dishwasher the
[27:23] water out when she turned around the
[27:24] corral fence there he stood leaning at
[27:27] the corral fence he said hello
[27:29] she was say now think about that when
[27:32] first time you've heard that gospel call
[27:34] first time you saw somebody manifest the
[27:37] life of Christ that God telling you
[27:39] hello she was so ashamed because that
[27:43] was the superintendent's boy the son of
[27:44] the owner of the ranch she held the dish
[27:46] pinned down so he wouldn't notice her so
[27:48] ragged started backing off with her bare
[27:50] feet looking back like this man walked
[27:53] up to her said don't be afraid of me
[27:55] said I want to tell you something he
[27:57] said I come out of here for one purpose
[27:59] I come home to find a wife I said I've
[28:02] been looking everywhere said I didn't
[28:04] want to marry any of the girls back
[28:05] there in the city I want to get what I
[28:07] thought was a real life it said of all
[28:10] that I was seeking I've been noticing
[28:12] you around here and I found out through
[28:14] some of the hands that your cousin said
[28:16] that's right sir I want to ask you
[28:18] something will you marry me why she
[28:21] didn't know what she was so descent she
[28:23] didn't know how to answer the man and so
[28:26] he's issues that invitation whether you
[28:28] marry me and in the Old Testament what
[28:32] they would do is they would sit down
[28:33] they would have when they made an
[28:35] arrangement to get married they would do
[28:37] go through this ceremony called the
[28:39] ketubah the groom would come to the
[28:41] parents and-and-and he would write down
[28:44] everything that he's gonna do to provide
[28:47] for this girl he would write it all down
[28:50] to make sure there was no
[28:51] misunderstanding he would write a
[28:54] written promise and he was they would
[28:56] seal it with witnesses everybody would
[28:58] be around okay I see you writing this
[29:01] and then and what was included in the
[29:03] ketubah was a promise that he would
[29:05] close her that he would feed her and
[29:07] then he would give her seed that he
[29:09] would give her children that she would
[29:11] produce a child for him he that was all
[29:14] written in that promise but so the bride
[29:17] the bride's role she really don't have
[29:19] to do too much all she has to do is
[29:22] accept the proposal do you think about
[29:24] the responsibilities of the groomers are
[29:26] to provide he's got
[29:28] provide the food but all the wife has to
[29:31] do is just accept and trust him she
[29:33] don't have to provide as he is his
[29:36] written promise that he will provide
[29:38] he's the one that provides and so they
[29:42] they wrote this this this promise down
[29:44] seal it up when the mouth and when the
[29:48] witnesses and then under that chew to
[29:50] poo they were breaking open when the
[29:53] wedding was was under that covering but
[29:57] right there when they would say their
[29:58] vows they would open that up and it
[30:00] would be read in public so you think
[30:05] think about how this compares with the
[30:07] seals how God wrote his promises who
[30:11] wrote his promises down and sealed it up
[30:13] and waited until the whole process was
[30:16] completed wait to the end and then you
[30:17] can open it up and say this is the one
[30:20] this is how I saved her this is how I
[30:22] did it it was already written and the
[30:26] bride maybe didn't even realize that
[30:28] that until she got up there that all
[30:31] those things that God had promised that
[30:34] he's achieved she was always on his mind
[30:36] from the foundation of the world God had
[30:39] thought about I heard written all those
[30:41] things down then you get under that
[30:42] Tituba under the covering of the Lord
[30:44] and the wedding the wedding vows are
[30:47] broken open and read so that everybody
[30:50] knows what what his thoughts of her were
[30:54] from the beginning the Revelation
[30:58] chapter tore brother and said well I
[31:01] just imagine how she felt don't you
[31:03] when me a sinner wants no good for
[31:05] nothing and drunkards John Jesus Christ
[31:07] I won't use for mine how could he ever
[31:09] come to somebody like me how could he
[31:11] ever say I'll give you a home in heaven
[31:13] how could he ever say I'll save you such
[31:15] a rich isn't me how could it ever be but
[31:17] he did it she said sir I'm not worthy I
[31:20] couldn't make a wife to a man like you
[31:22] said because you are used to green
[31:23] things and I
[31:24] nothing about them up or he said but you
[31:27] are my choice
[31:28] and it wasn't nice when Jesus told you
[31:31] that you know you wasn't worthy to be a
[31:33] Christian you there wasn't nothing you
[31:35] could ever do but he just chose you it's
[31:39] his business goodness his mercy that he
[31:41] chose you you didn't choose him you know
[31:44] he chose you that's right don't look at
[31:46] your clothes I don't look at your
[31:48] clothes I look at what you are he said
[31:50] will you marry me and finally the
[31:52] agreement was made the agreement look at
[31:55] to put was made and he said one year
[31:58] from this day I will return you realize
[32:02] how perfect the messages he probably he
[32:04] probably didn't even realize exactly how
[32:07] he was framing that but that is
[32:08] absolutely biblical the agreement was
[32:11] made the ketubah was made she acted and
[32:14] had to follow the biblical pattern and
[32:16] he said one year from this date I don't
[32:17] return you'd be ready have the wedding
[32:19] your arm at home so I will return and
[32:22] marry you right here on these grounds
[32:24] and I'll take you to Chicago that I
[32:25] would drive there well you have a castle
[32:27] to live in and all this dishwashing will
[32:30] be over and things leave so then we got
[32:35] a porter you gotta have a message you
[32:37] can have a minister to join the two
[32:39] together in mark 13 and many other
[32:42] scriptures talk about how you have a
[32:44] mourner to watch that does the other
[32:45] scripture that talks about there's a
[32:47] porter standing in the door to open and
[32:48] the porter job is to close with you with
[32:51] that raiment to get you ready to priest
[32:54] or so the bride is ready the
[32:57] unpardonable sin brother Graham said the
[32:58] bridegroom in the audience today the
[33:00] bridegroom sets the wedding supper and
[33:02] when he did is up to him to furnish the
[33:04] room the bride the bride all she has to
[33:07] do is show up it's the groom's
[33:09] responsibility to provide and give her
[33:11] food clothing children all of that Jesus
[33:14] Christ centered the wedding supper at
[33:16] the end of the life and it's up to him
[33:17] to furnish the preparation of the robes
[33:19] and at the door the porter as it was
[33:21] with his close friends stood there and
[33:24] every man they come up with a ticket got
[33:26] the same kind of road they put it on him
[33:29] if he was in rags or if he was in Brawl
[33:30] cloth just the same you were the Rope
[33:33] cause he looked just exactly like the
[33:35] rest of them that's exactly right and so
[33:37] we know how that the the RO the garment
[33:41] was speaking of the baptism of the Holy
[33:44] Ghost
[33:44] it's his righteousness not ours
[33:48] but so then you have a door the door to
[33:50] get in to the way the door he said I am
[33:53] the door the Sheep the duck the porter
[33:56] stands at the door getting you clothed
[33:57] so that you can go into the door he said
[34:00] I am the door I think I've already read
[34:04] that but so the bride's the bride's
[34:07] responsibility is to launch yourself
[34:09] when you come when you come to a wedding
[34:12] she's gonna come washed in the water of
[34:15] the word may any are her hair done and
[34:19] everything the veil clothed clothed in
[34:21] the righteousness of God so that she can
[34:23] stand when the whiteness of that of that
[34:26] white dress showing that she's
[34:28] absolutely righteous not any kind of
[34:31] spot or anything ready to take those
[34:33] vials revelation 19:7 says let us be
[34:37] glad and rejoice and give honour to him
[34:38] for the marriage of the lamb has come
[34:40] and his wife hath made herself ready of
[34:44] course if there's a lot of people that
[34:45] that say they're in the bride but
[34:46] they're not making themselves ready
[34:48] that's the foolish virgin they will
[34:50] realize that they're foolish right there
[34:52] at the end they're foolish because they
[34:54] they didn't do what was necessary to
[34:57] prepare themselves
[34:59] so we talked also about how when you
[35:01] come to a wedding you got to make those
[35:05] because the minister has to make that
[35:07] declaration
[35:08] any reason why these two can't be joined
[35:10] together because the first husband can't
[35:12] be dead
[35:13] now the first doesn't has to be dated
[35:16] the first husband where you were joined
[35:17] to the to your denominational ideas your
[35:20] own thoughts all those things that all
[35:24] that has to be done away with there's
[35:26] quotes for brother I set up you know you
[35:28] what happens is you still carry on if
[35:30] you come out of denominational systems
[35:31] you care to carry on some of those ideas
[35:33] and things about how the Baptist said
[35:36] that well as soon as you get baptized
[35:38] and you're born again you that's going
[35:40] to die although all those ideas and
[35:42] things that they presented her only
[35:44] incorrectly has to die so that you can
[35:46] receive the word so to be married to the
[35:49] second Adam Christ the word you must
[35:50] separate yourself by death from your
[35:52] first denominational husband because
[35:54] there isn't a one of them that can take
[35:55] all the Word of God and then I just put
[36:01] this quote in here from a wedding
[36:02] ceremony that brother Graham did where
[36:05] he asked that question if there's anyone
[36:06] here they can show it just cause while
[36:08] they should not be lawful joined in this
[36:10] holy matrimony let them now speak or
[36:12] forever hold their peace you know a lot
[36:14] of modern wedding planners they take
[36:16] that out but they're like well you know
[36:18] that it's almost lost this the sanctity
[36:20] the wedding vows you know people almost
[36:23] look at weddings it's something that's
[36:25] not going to last forever but this
[36:28] wedding is supposed to be forever you're
[36:31] supposed to come into it soberly and
[36:35] prayerfully and you spiritually you
[36:40] can't get married you cannot get the
[36:42] best of the Holy Ghost there's any
[36:44] reason why you can't be joined together
[36:51] now the wedding government so when you
[36:54] come to the come to the end you got to
[36:57] be clothed in his righteousness what do
[37:00] you think when the bride would come back
[37:01] and find a man is sitting there without
[37:02] a wedding garment on and he talks about
[37:05] how that now Jesus said this himself he
[37:07] called her the porter he said binding
[37:09] that foot in hand and he was cast out
[37:11] into outer darkness where they'll be
[37:12] weeping wailing and gnashing teeth
[37:14] that's Christ's own word right he was
[37:16] that's down because it proved without
[37:18] the wedding garment he comes some other
[37:21] way besides the door if he would have
[37:23] come by the door he would have received
[37:25] a wedding garment oh listen to this then
[37:28] if the wedding garment is the baptism in
[37:29] the Holy Spirit how are we going to be
[37:31] represented any other way
[37:34] then he keeps on going so let's pick the
[37:37] hope who would be found without the
[37:38] wedding garment let's look at brother
[37:40] brems explanation for this and Jeff over
[37:42] John in 1964 he said the Bible said when
[37:44] they come said give us some of your own
[37:47] they said the sleeping version there
[37:49] they realized they could have had all
[37:51] that time to get old but they didn't do
[37:55] so when the bridegroom was just about to
[37:58] come they said give us some of your all
[38:00] they said we just got enough for
[38:03] ourselves you go buy from them that sale
[38:06] and while they were gone the bribery
[38:09] come and the bride went in and they were
[38:10] cast into outer darkness
[38:12] what's outer darkness in this case to
[38:15] wake up and find out the rapture was
[38:18] gone and there and they were left where
[38:22] they will be weeping and wailing the
[38:24] Tribulation Period and gnashing of teeth
[38:26] and he goes on to say if you haven't got
[38:28] the Holy Spirit open Victor enough to
[38:30] know that you should have it would you
[38:32] raise up your hand and he's giving that
[38:34] invitation again to the wedding sir so
[38:37] then you've got a minister Peter Paul
[38:39] talked about how he espoused the church
[38:42] he said for I am jealous over you with
[38:44] godly jealousy for I have a spouse you
[38:46] know one husband and I'm a present you
[38:48] as a chaste virgin to Christ he's
[38:52] because if you gotta have a minute to do
[38:55] that when to perform that wedding
[38:57] ceremony and then you gotta have it to
[39:03] the to pose the canopy and this it's
[39:06] strong number it talks about what the
[39:08] definition for that to pray is a chamber
[39:11] a room the canopy a closet thinking with
[39:16] all the spiritual applications with it
[39:18] that is it's divine protection where you
[39:23] get under that chupa and in God's like
[39:27] like bow has a skirt over roof trying to
[39:34] reach for a name so that you pull looks
[39:38] like this you get under that they're not
[39:40] a monitor coupon that they were the
[39:43] minister and the bride and the groom was
[39:45] standing to this and and they would make
[39:48] their wedding vows and you could see
[39:49] this in the scripture in Joel chapter 2
[39:51] verse 16 that says to gather the people
[39:54] sanctify the congregation a simple the
[39:57] elders gathered the children and those
[39:59] the signa breasts let the bridegroom go
[40:01] forth from his chamber and the bride out
[40:04] of the closet and that word falls it in
[40:08] the hebrew it's it's that word shoot the
[40:12] bride so we've got chambers and clauses
[40:16] and all of this is signifying a real
[40:19] relationship between the bride and the
[40:21] groom psalm 19 says that their line is
[40:26] going out through all the earth and
[40:28] their worst the end of the world and
[40:29] then Hathi set a tabernacle for the Sun
[40:31] which is a as a bridegroom coming out of
[40:34] his chamber and rejoiceth as a strong
[40:36] man to run a race there's that to work
[40:39] cheap again coming out of his chamber
[40:42] that is a ten covering
[40:48] like like in roof he said who are thou
[40:51] she answered I am Ruth I had me spread
[40:54] therefore thigh skirt over that hen me
[40:56] for thou art a near kinsman because this
[40:59] covering or the ten shows a protection
[41:03] of divine protection that he is that
[41:06] they're in a special relationship with
[41:09] one another
[41:10] he's going to take care of her and the
[41:13] waters of separation brother Brown talks
[41:15] about this you know you can follow this
[41:18] pattern Oppel through the message Butler
[41:20] talks about the kitchen the kitchen is
[41:22] where you eat after you come and eat
[41:24] like the church you set on the beach and
[41:25] hear the word faith comes by hearing
[41:27] then after you've eaten the word then
[41:29] you come into the living room which is
[41:30] in the fellowship with the rest of the
[41:32] church but then after that the secret
[41:35] place or this to the secret place is the
[41:39] bedroom where you go in and kneel down
[41:41] where you a bunch of you man B's used to
[41:43] a long time ago go in there and pray for
[41:45] your children when they was out at night
[41:47] so the chupa is getting into a
[41:50] relationship with God whether it's love
[41:53] the love is what happens in the children
[41:56] something special is going on that's
[41:58] that's private that's not not even
[42:00] really visible to anyone outside nobody
[42:03] knows what's going on in the chupa but
[42:05] the bride and the groom you see my
[42:10] hidden life program said that every man
[42:12] that stays in the presence of God into
[42:13] this great secret place hid away will
[42:16] yield the fruits of righteousness Peace
[42:18] Love joy long-suffering goodness
[42:20] gentleness patience don't fuss about
[42:23] these other things get that in your life
[42:25] and you'll never get
[42:26] until you hide away with God into that
[42:28] land of adoption see if I can finish on
[42:32] the next couple of slides let's let's
[42:37] get down to e 25 he said no no every
[42:39] year that a priest entered into that
[42:40] place - congregation followed him up and
[42:43] when he went into this great place where
[42:45] the veil dropped behind him talking
[42:46] about the high priest the intercourse
[42:48] the holiness of points no one there to
[42:50] go after them then he was alone with God
[42:52] what a beautiful picture is today of a
[42:55] consecrated life who once enters into
[42:57] with Christ dead to the things of the
[42:59] world get away with God and the veils
[43:01] drop down around and all the world shut
[43:03] off within Christianity and religion
[43:05] becomes a pleasure to every believer so
[43:09] there's that children which is a time
[43:11] and I'm going to hurry through these
[43:13] last couple of slides that that tent of
[43:16] meeting the tabernacle you go into the
[43:18] holiest of Holies and as you and God
[43:20] alone through that you come through the
[43:22] parlor into the kitchen only into the
[43:25] that's thinking and that compare is on
[43:30] into if you if you look at all the feast
[43:32] days that you have gone all the way down
[43:33] through the seven churches off compare
[43:35] all the feasts you end up with this
[43:37] feast of tabernacles a tabernacle a
[43:41] little tent where you go in there and
[43:43] you eat you eat a meal the meal was
[43:46] prepared there's so many things you can
[43:52] look at here
[43:53] but this is just kind of an outline of
[43:55] where the feast of tabernacles falls for
[43:57] those last feast at the end of the year
[44:02] the Feast of Trumpets the Day of
[44:03] Atonement and then the feast of
[44:04] tabernacles Falls for seven days where
[44:07] they eat inside of that covering that
[44:09] losses that they made and then you have
[44:16] the supper see that that eating inside
[44:19] of that Tabernacle folder right into the
[44:22] summer and we'll just we'll stop right
[44:24] there cuz I've run out of time
