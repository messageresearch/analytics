don't you right Moses had been many times in his presence but he wanted to see that's right that's what I want to do too good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn back where we've been reading Matthew 5 and then we will go to Exodus 12 Matthew 5 in Exodus 12 now remember the Bible study will be this coming Saturday 6:00 and just be much in prayer come and be with us it' be common questions in other words ORD there questions right off the the floor and you know we've had been having a good time doing that just talking about things that's on the people's heart so remember that all remember then the uh next Wednesday the 18th brother Aaron will be taking the services here for us on Wednesday because uh Wade and Zach and Donnie and myself will be over in Alabama hunting so so just remember that and pray that the Lord would would bless us and take care of us and give us a good time in him remember those now Terrence made the announcement too about the changing the date of the uh banquet that we have so we had to change that because of uh brother Daniel G Diner's church and the youth there of heaven so we changed it over to not conflict with it to where if you could you know if you were going that's fine and then we'd have ours to our time so it'll be on the 18th so remember that just look at the thing as you going down and don't forget it okay any other announcements I generally forget something okay all right so let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your love and your grace Lord un to us we thank you for the fact that you saved us yes Lord what would it be if we didn't have you in an hour and a time when there's nothing certain yes nothing Everlasting nothing to be worth anything even if we own the whole world it's going down the drain that's right and Lord but to just have one little speck of eternal life in our soul that's right and to be the children of almighty God that's right we love you father and we thank you we ask you to just bless us now with your presence as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts give us what you'd have for us to hear this day Lord and teach us to wait upon you in Jesus name amen Matthew 5 we're just start about verse 43 you have heard it hath been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven that's right for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and on and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have you do not even the publicans the same and if you salute your brethren only what do you more than others do not even the publicans so be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect amen so now let's go over to Exodus 12 and we'll begin verse 12 for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and will Smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and Beast and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment I am the Lord and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are ye are and when I see the the blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now the Lord will end this coming Sunday we'll try to um bring this to a conclusion of of U maybe having questions and answers comments Etc we've been saying that now me to get another message for but that's all right but I'm sure it will come eventually we'll get to that anyway but you know I'm just wanting to try to get us to understand and then that way if you have any questions or whatever write it down you know and and give it to me and I love to read them Sister Barbara wrote me a about a three or four page uh comment about the the message basically this last weekend and I really enjoyed reading it you know and I I'd like to hear your comments and things because I want to know whether or not it's dwelling within each one of us and coming to the place of understanding right amen and I've been thinking a lot this week on one thing you know what what what a wonderful opportunity for you and I that we can be the children of God Amen that's right you think about that I mean that's just you know that's very simple I know but that's just been a thought on my my heart all this week right to just think about amen I didn't get to know my father because he passed away before became old enough to remember much about him and everything but I guess that's what makes the difference to think about you know and and realized and to know that I have a heavenly father that's right that I can talk to see even that if my Earthly father would have been here or would even be here now which would be hard to be in the age but still you know if IID have got to have known him and everything still I couldn't you know I I could have talked with him on rare occasions or fellowship with him a little but you know our father we all we got to do is just we don't even have to uh pray out loud we don't have to communicate and holl up into the heavens and and everything and just but just to stop and just think a little amen and just think that he chose us amen out of all of the people of the world Amen there's some good people in this world I mean there are good people out there but to think that he chose us amen he chose us not only to salvation but he chose us to reveal himself to us amen reveal himself to us right the Eternal God would think enough of you and I amen the cond sin down and speak to us amen and reveal himself to us it's just you know you can't hardly even think about it without just breaking down crying and and things you know and like I think it was brother Rand said it makes you feel like you you could just it's been said you know that you could crawl under a concrete block with a 10 gon hat on your head and never even turn the block over cuz it just makes you so little to think about those things that's right but that's you know that's just him now let's get into the point tonight because I told you Sunday I told you up front what we're going to do and that's what we'll try to do tonight and you know and I told you like up front that I was when it says you know that uh his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin well I hope you was listening and and understanding what I was trying to bring that it's the seed of God that cannot s right you and I were born in sin sh in iniquity no matter what good we think we are or whatever we're we're we're just worth nothing right and and but yet that seed remaineth in us and we cannot sin so there is a man that see we've been preaching about for all this time you know there is a man that God will not impute sin right right well see how could he impute sin to himself right I I hope you listening there Sunday go back and listen to it how could he impute sin to himself how could how could the baptism of the Holy Ghost sin right how can God sin how can can there be anything credited to him right well I thought that we believe that it was the father dwelling in us you know and if he's dwelling in us then how could there ever be anything imputed to that right it won't it won't work right we may make human mistakes yes and all like that we even may as a prophet would say we may even willfully and I know how he covers that on both stages of he said if we send willfully I receive the knowledge of the truth are in Hebrews there's no more sacrifice I know too that he'll say we would even willfully do wrong right come we no better to do it and then we'll go do it and know but immediately we repent amen yes Lord and get rid of that we don't you know it don't just Linger on and on we get rid of it and ask our father to forgive us but if the father's dwelling in Us by the new birth you know if he's in there by the new birth amen how can he that's inside of me do anything wrong that's right amen well then are you going to try to split up the soul of the individual because that's where we believe the new birth is at right right are you going to try to split that up up that somewhere in that soul is you and somewhere there's God and you know and all this that and the other I I you you're not getting them what I tried to preach right I I tried my best to bring it out to us that that we supposed to be dead amen right Samuel Dale was supposed to be dead right William Brenham was he said died 30 something years ago right we're supposed to be dead and he's supposed to be alive that's right all right now if that's that way then and we believe it then there's no way inwardly a man can sin right all right so then we'll just take the point right up the front tonight see cuz that's what I tried to make the point then to get you to see that the seed of God is the alive word amen now a seed without life is no good right neither is the word of God a natural seed without life is is not worth anything right sure make some good cornbread or something out of it but it won't reproduce itself amen right but see then the seed of God being the alive word and the prophet of God I gave it to you there last week on paragraph 273 is not on the notes or nothing God's power to transform he actually says that the seed of God he ask the question he said how many in here has the seed of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost right amen and I said praise the Lord when I read that cuz that's what it is right see and that way you're not dealing with any kind of a natural seed or genetics or anything you're dealing with the one seed which is Christ right amen and that seed must be made alive that word is God's seed right but that word without the life it won't produce anything but if it's made alive so then the alive word is what we we have see the baptism of the Holy Ghost so now we should be able to see that and understand MH that there's no way that that Soul can sin so it's not that God don't impute sin to it it's the fact that it can't sin right that's what I hope you got the scripture putting it together with with David and them saying you know blessed is the man to whom God would not impute sin and then bring it over to you know and Paul bringing that across and then bringing it over to to where we were dealing with and John saying that his seed remaineth in and he cannot sin am right amen all right putting on all together then there's just no way that that Soul can sin right so it's not that God don't impute as you try to be some fancy something or some great something that God won't impute right no no CU we went through it and covered it right God did impute to David yep the things he had done right now it didn't stop him from receiving eternal life later right because he will in the resurrection or whatever whatever you're going to deal with the Old Testament people they did not get eternal life back there right all right but yet that was imputed because he lost a child and lost a throne and all kind of things right right so then by by doing that and as a covered Paul even said I Die daily amen all right see then those two men couldn't have been saying out of one side of their mouth that I do things wrong and and then out of the other side of the mouth saying you know blessed is the man to whom God will not impute right because if you think you're so great that God won't impute well then God didn't die for you right that's as simple as I can make it he didn't die for for me or you if we think we're so great and don't need it that would have been messing all up God's plan but now in covering tonight he's taking it from the Outlook of what we tried to bring out there that the soul is born again and it cannot sin it's perfectly totally sinless all right so when Jesus said be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect you've got the only way to be as perfect as their father is perfect is to have a life of the father right that should be sensible you know you need a great Revelation to just read that or think about it that he's G us his own life made us Eternal he made us Eternal he made us Perfect Right amen right but now see we're still left with this part out here and I know that I I I I've tried to emphasize to you over the years that a true Born Again believer so that Soul can't sin right but this body and spirit is still in the domain of sa right it's still subject to things of Life the world and and whatever see and and and being it it's getting worse now because Satan knows that he's just got a little season left because if he don't need if he don't know that he already listen to CNN you know you know what I'm saying cuz everybody saying this horrible things you know and and all like that so then he ought to get down to to watching some of his own TV maybe himself right but now see that that spirit and that body is is still in this domain you say well we're we're just a a unit of Body Spirit and soul okay but now if you make the soul sin and you have it as a unit and saying that your body Spirit Soul sin then look what You' have you'd have God s it right there's no way to reach Perfection n way right I mean no way period BL I'm sorry but there's no way that you could ever find perfection in anything don't you have God sending right H but you say well we're just we we're just all a product no by the new birth we're not a product of sin amen right we're product of God Amen he was the beginning of the creation we're the rest of that creation are you going to uh impute to him wrong no no we don't want to do that but see we want to get it in the right place that still as a human in our our Realms of where we're at that we we have problems with our body and our spirit and that's what I want to deal with tonight because to me David when he said blessed is to whom God will not impute sin follow me the words I'm saying now he cannot be talking of an eternal person right because an eternal person won sin right all right so he's talking more of the rest of this being that you look at because he is saying blessed is the man to whom God will not impute sin showing that that man does sin right right are you listening amen words why would he say it that way right blessed is the man to whom God will not impute sin well that means that that person sins well God won't impute it I mean is any problem with that that's right I mean that's to me that's simple because he wouldn't be talking about Sin if there wasn't sin involved right right but see that then that way we're looking at the body and the spirit still in Satan's domain and there has to be a Redemption of this right all right so then in the meantime in the meantime of waiting for the Redemption then we have to have a covering that's right cuz see that's what the blood of the bulls and goats done right it covered demand in back DIY you know it was a token that's right okay the blood was a token all right now as it did then it covered them that when they done certain things wrong they go up and offer the offer that would cover that we we've been through this but the once a year see for the whole thing of Israel yeah it would go in and make an atonement or a covering that's the title of the message more and just a covering all right and that blood of bulls and goats would cover that people until God would not destroy him right all right so it was wonderful and the prophet of God said now if under the blood of bulls and goats right God did not you know kill those people for the sin theyve done wrong he said what about under the blood of Jesus Christ that's right all right see then that would come down to where that it would bring us to a Greater Hope and understanding of who we are right and what's going on CU see this out here I keep saying it this body is motivated by a spirit that's within him amen all right y and and then as doing that then it can yield to that old desires right and see that that's why that I I I've tried to always be playing with you but honest people are say oh when I got born again everything went out well I pray to God that's true right I I just don't believe it right amen because I I I didn't experience it that way now the old sin of My Life The Wait the things that I repented of sure it went away from me sure I changed my nature way I begin to do different and and act different okay right we're we're on there but still it never took away all of the problem right all right and in one way it put me into a greater condition because it brought within this unit that we talk about it brought a Waring between the two as Paul was explaining right and one yielding to the flesh the other yielding to the spirit of God that's within him and it puts us in a Warfare amen and and see we didn't even have a knowledge of sin until the law came to condemn us and things so when the new birth came a lot of the things we used to think wasn't wrong right yeah we begin to be more conscious about what we were doing right right they used to think well they going to lose my temper a little bit well I can't help it that's just old day or you know as part of my family we're all like this well then we come to realize hey that's not no justification anymore that's right right it's not what Mom and Daddy do it's it's us all right now see what I'm hoping this will try to explain maybe something to you to me too is anybody in here that would say you don't ever have any wrong thoughts that's got hands yet but right well is any of you would say you never had any wrong desires all right don't you wonder about that don't you wonder about that you ever had a bad dream right I mean maybe vul dreams you know right maybe uh wanting not maybe to lust in your body that way but maybe being see yourself mad at somebody or see yourself in your dreams that you know I I I used to I'd always do it and I never could figure that one out but maybe one of these days I'll ask the Lord about it but I'd always try to whip weight in my dream within my hand would just stop I always wonder what happened if I could went on through with it but you know but you never had this wrong dreams that you you know that it's not part of your really your true makeup right oh yeah you know it's not part of your natural true make up amen and you you never wondered about why that would be that way right right and and you never thought about it say basically dreams or something uh dealing with in toward the subconscious part of the human as to wondering if and then brother Ram would say the soul is the subconscious right yeah and then you wait a minute now the soul is the subconscious and then the dream is in a subconscious and here I am having wrong dreams does it mean I'm lost you don't you don't never think that way right well I'm just honest right amen I mean right you may say well I since I got born again I ain't never had a negative thought about whether I saved or not well I pray and hope that that's right I do I just don't believe it but I pray I hope that's that's right okay oh my you never question your salvation amen you've never the devil never has come to you and told you you was lost M well see then this is I'm trying to talk about cuz I've tried to explain it for 40 years this is not a new message to me trying to preach to you and you that have been around know for sure that's true and I've always tried to preach to show you a condition or existence that the new birth with inside of you is perfectly totally sinless amen but the body and spirit of man is in a turmoil and Satan is attacking that amen and and and you know I mean I've got up and pray to God why would I dream y a dream like that a horrible dream you know why would I have wrong desires right you said well now wait a minute now maybe my desires is a little different your desires but my when I'm talking about desires doesn't always mean that you're running around you know so lustful that you can't stand it I'm not I'm always just beening plain all right right it's just any little thing you know I remember I used to I finally told Brother Mo you know that we'd be going down the highway and he'd be talking to me about the lord the devil and I'd be driving he said run off the road on his side and let hit a tree you Ain never thought like that you ain't never had the devil to tempt you in the thing right amen well pray for me okay because and I finally out life and told him one day I said brother M Devil's been trying to get me to kill you ever since me and you got together he just Li but but you see to understand what I'm talking about you can understand the human being right you can understand that that we are the most wonderful product amen that's right now we're not like Jesus Jesus didn't have these things but still now even Jesus was tempted right yes sir amen you agree and brother R said even by women sure so now you do what you want to about it I'm sure not in this garbage can of saying that that Jesus done wrong right temptation is not wrong it's when you yield a Temptation amen not wrong to be tempted you know it's wrong to yield to the Temptation amen but you see then that way we can see our eles in what we really are and you see that really then this is what David and and Paul was talking about that if there's any way that God could make it for us then there's a covering there right that covers Us that even when we do wrong amen that it covers Us yes Lord yeah if under the blood of bulls and goats that could cover how much more would it be under the blood of Jesus Christ amen that's right to cover us see th to me is what David and Paul is talking about right bless is the man to whom God will not impute sin right yes sir though we got to explaining the other day now everybody says sin sin sin you know and I know that probably didn't go over with maybe was some of you that didn't go over a probably sure out on the internet that's all right I just preach what I believe you there's one thing about it you come and ask me I'll tell you what I believe I'm not these kind of preachers that run around and around and around and then you know just let you believe what you want to about what I believe I'm going to tell you that's right and that way then I I don't have to worry about it because I can be honest but see I believe David was looking at at at a person that would stand on the Earth by the new birth and say not that we don't sin right cuz we just covered it Sunday John said if you say you don't sin you're a liar right amen right that's you know brother R said we sin every day see you say well brother no no don't try to prop it up see and say well it's not talking about he said he s there so I think he was born get believer right amen amen don't try to make it somebody in justification or sanctification yeah and try to prop up something with it I I I believe he was there all right but see David and them was looking down then and David wasn't necessarily looking at himself because he knew that sin was imputed unto him right but he knew there was a protective covering all right and you remember we preach your while what that was was God looking at the atonement or was he looking at his word right which is the greatest part was the atonement the animal the sacrifice greater than the word that he said so when David come to the place he that he condemned his own life and said bring the man you're not killing Nathan said Thou Art the man but immediately see the prophet of God his words he said but David you want die that the child ad die said you won't die right why because it was a protective point of the word of the Prophet amen so which one do you want you want the atoma you want a natural animal or do you want God's word amen that's right I'll take his word because his word then I can I can abide by that's right all right see all of this is tied together down through many many messages and and I know somebody hear hear me one time you don't know what I'm talking about well I'm sorry uh I don't have enough time tonight to repr preach all that I preached for years but I've been preaching this for 40 years not that we're such a goody goody people that God don't impute to us right no oh and that's his wonderful little children now you're making him a do to your granddaddy that's right that's right you making him just a word that well it's okay for my my kids I've been around people that believe that but I don't believe it right amen my wife my children my grandchildren my daughter-in-laws my son-in-law my great grandkids they all got to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right all right that's right they all got to have the new birth they ain't going to heaven just because Pap was going right now we've claimed them and God will bring them all right that's another part of the course right but I still don't automatically give them eternal life that's right but you see then David was looking and seeing himself but in Prophecy he was speaking of the new birth that would come right in other words you can say David by the spirit was saying or by the Holy Spirit was saying blessed is the man to whom God will not impute sin and he knew that even though it was imputed unto him that that covering of his day God would not destroy him right now how much more would be the blood of Jesus Christ amen to where we can look in this day where we're at and down here and believe and see that ever born again believer brother R I gave it to you remember in in the seal book I know first seal he said ever born he say anybody perfect he said ever born again believer is perfectly totally sinless Amen in the sight of God right all right so then y solve the case right right amen but then our body and our spirit is keeping us from is that's what is that the point of keeping us from adoption that's right cuz it's not the adoption and the things based upon our our lives and our yielding ourselves to God that's right and then that way you can be a child of God but not be adopted right right because of the nature and the ways that we are right surely we wouldn't have any concept or thought within our mind that uh we're a special kind of people we are because because what God has made us right amen that's right that's what's wonderful amen he has given us eternal life by giving us the his own life then he could set us free yes amen he could lose us from sin right all right but then there's got to be a covering just like the prophet would say he said you're not saved by the blood you remember that that's right amen he said you're kept saved by it now what does he mean if we're good Baptist and and get it off when we believe and what do we need anything else for yeah see the prophet was Sav the truth of it by the new birth we're perfectly totally sinless in our soul but our body and spirit is in this world and realm that we live in and still subject to these things right and The Temptations things see that's why then looking at it the secret of all of the things is whether or not we believe that the blood keeps us safe right amen now we're not saved by the blood we're saved by the life that's right that is within the blood all right but the blood is a covering right right right so then as long as we can stay under the covering all right now get the natural story Israel that covering was good for one year you agree right now you had animal sacrifices for different things and things that went wrong or or birth of a child or or sickness or something is healed you had all kind of sacrifices right but the main thing I'm trying to get you to look at is the atonement that was made see once a year and it covered Israel for that year but there had to be another one made the next year okay but then when Jesus Christ came to bring it into a condition that was not just the blood of a of an animal it was not even the blood of a man amen it was the blood of God right amen that's the man that we need to look to all right so now my point is what as long as we're under the protective cover of the Covenant yeah that's it then God W to impute sin see that's where we don't listen to brother of randam and pay close attention I was talking with someone yesterday about that and I said just you know we we just don't listen we don't hear what brother ROM said but if he said something we should base our life on it right of course you know what everybody does I base my life on it but you know then he says forsake not to S well he wouldn't let the Lord say that you know yeah but that's it's all right but listen Church to me it the secret is whether or not we can believe that that blood is covering us right all right now on that basis remember one thing I said most people they can they they'll read things but they pass over L you know that brother around said there's not a sinner in the world today no you want te quote he said because the atonement was made and God can't see it right all right you said well look at that old CER we was down my mother-in-law was one Sunday and it was a lot of her family was there you know and I mean it was honest I'm not throwing off home just making a point all right and this man next door was cutting grass you know he was going out through there cutting grass on Sunday and this lady she said he's going to die and go to hell for that said boy he'll regret that one of these days cutting Grist on the Sabbath and I didn't say nothing because I knew the way they believe it all right but you see there is no sinners in the world today right do we look down and see each other and call each other Sinners there if there's any sin why hasn't God Anni annihilated it right cuz sin in the presence of God one Split Second without a covering he would have to annihilate you right right all right see that's why I even covered you know over and over about uh Adam and Eve in the garden who took care of them until God made the atonement with the animals amen it was God's word right amen that's right they said he stood as a l slave before the foundation of the world right amen you know that brother rown I think it's in this he said you know that the way God sees you he said said he sees you exactly like he saw you before the world right when he put you name on the blood yeah right all right now here's what I'm saying and this is going to be hard to follow so listen please and go back and listen to this tape again because I'm just going the best I can go then if there is no sinner because an atonement was made to cover the world with a bumper of blood right right the blood of Jesus Christ the prophet said was like a bumper you remember and we'll get one in a minute you remember he went in one day and he saw this police officer over here and saw this woman over here and the jeuk joint going and all these things well he he wanted to kill him he said God I don't see I wor you could just put a the Lord said come behind the door I'd like to talk to you right he explains it like this he said I saw a vision right what now like the brother was bringing out the other day you know of whether it was fish was cooked and another scripture said it was baked and you yeah see you get all tied up in confusion right brother Brandon on another time he says I saw a vision in my mind y he wouldn't see naturally a vision in what he said I saw a vision in my mind and the Lord showed him all the little things of his life you remember right and said now you want to condemn her well you know what he went over and [Music] repented bless God I ain't repenting for being one of just can't stand sin well he went over to her and repented and you know what she got saved that night some of the others there too because of what he said right but do you understand what I'm getting at he said when I see the blood I'll pass over you I gave you a quote the other day where brother R said he can't inuk sin over the tokens that's right d all right now I'm going to try to explain something that ain't never tried to explain so all right listen you see we are a a unit we are a people we're Body Spirit and soul and you know when God gave you that new birth he's pleased to dwell in you that's right exactly oh no that's Jesus on the river Jord brother R said he's pleased to dwell and he's even pleased to honor your word am he pleased to dwell okay and then he says I I won't impute sin the prophet God of God said he can't see us he said you look through red it red yep and said you see what he said he can't see us because of the bumper blood right said but he hears our voice amen that's right you know like show you want it maybe in here my brother around was talking about healing he said he hears my voice through the blood and he said I'm asking for healing what about that asking for healing right as it being compared to the blood of Jesus Christ well you know I thought we believe the Bible that says by his stripes we are healed right well the prophet was right wasn't he mhm right he said through the blood the atonement I'm asking for healing well he was just asking him to fulfill the scripture cuz the blood run out when they beat him right so the blood run out for our healing all right that's right so now listen then see then by the soul that soul is perfect amen but because of the atonement that we exist under all right wake up cuz you don't you know then it's possible if we can believe God's word until our body and spirit won't be controlling us right sure oh we may be human yeah we make mistakes yeah but under the blood where can he impute sin now come on because you know what the prophet said is right he said that there is no sinner in the world today he said because it's under the bump of blood think about it amen he said he don't even cond a sinner for sin he said he just condemned us because he is a sinner right we're we're not Sinners we're the children of God Amen now I'm talking about ever born again Believer from Pentecost right so don't just think I'm jumping down to this end to make some great big something out of the end time of some great big Supernatural Revelation this end time boy would nobody got it down to here no there didn't nobody know about it until here right they didn't understand it that's right until now you said well if I believe that Brother D I'd just go out and live like the devil you got you want to quote mhm brother BR said I always do what I want to do amen he said if you go that way you prove you're lost yep that's right but now listen if God is Not imputing sin to The Sinner you know he's not Anni right now one day the blood will be gone right right right that's why the wrath of God will be poured out that's the tribulation uh persecution is not Tri right exactly amen persecution the early church had a great persecution right but they didn't have tribulation tribulation is the wrath of God because the blood's gone right and that's when you'll pray to die and can't y see that will be the tribulation we certainly don't want to be there amen because the blood will be gone but as long as the blood's here you know God don't see us amen thank you Lord now come on how long do I need to preach on the Old Testament people when balum was trying to get God to curse Israel and he even showed God the hinder parts of Israel you know the worst things that could have been trans spiring cuz it's called the hinder parts right but you know what God said he said don't see them don't see amen B would try to curse Israel and God say I don't even see it Amen brother said the reason they didn't that bam couldn't understand because he said he couldn't understand that they Israel had an atonement that's right amen they had a covering that's over them they had the pillar of fire to vindicate who they were and no matter how bad it got he never killed all of them that's right now do I need to go back and preach over it again where that that Moses told Aaron said Aaron your sensor go among the people and stop it God will hear Moses even said Lord you're going to block them out block me out said I'll go up pre-venture I'll make an atonement by his own words right I preached on these things you ought to be listening I rather have the word of God than an atonement I'd rather have the word of God to hold it into my listen I'd rather have the word of God to hold it into my hands and be able to read off the pages than to have my hands covered by the blood of Jesus Christ amen amen amen that's right oh wouldn't we honor that blood if we had it but what about honoring God's word to believe it right right cuz this is what he said this is what's going to set me free is his word brother said Don't listen to man he said listen to God right he say you're free you're loosed by the blood he said don't listen to man you know what he's saying about don't listen to man cuz man's always going to be trying to pull you back under it or either run off the other end of it to talk tell about how great you are whatever you are where it don't matter what you do yeah I a said a word about I'm just saying and I preach to you that we sin a sin as a Christian we reap a tough full that's right we have to repent not we're going to have to answer someday right right when you just got to sin nothing was imputed it's not imputed because of his imputed now you got to kill us y yep you better be right when the blood's gone I like what the old black man said I just don't want no trouble down at the river right amen I want it all done here are you following me right if the blood covering was enough in the Old Testament to keep the wrath of God off of the children of Israel and to atone for their sins what about the blood of Jesus Christ that was offered the Bible said once for all amen that's right and that he's even protected no matter who it is right now right amen the worst person you could think of in the world yep right Y is covered by the blood right now they don't give them eternal life now it's covered by the blood right and God hears their voice amen see then there is a man by the correct understanding there is a man here someone with the baptism of the Holy Ghost on the inside of them and a covering for the things even that they do but then what would we go do with all of that involved you never heard R around talk about he said if I go overseas and said if I go do something some woman comes along something happens he said said I come back and tell my wife said honey I'm sorry he said I believe she'd forgive me but he said how could I do that knowing she would forgive me you say Well it don't make no difference in Brother D you preaching don't make no difference what I do I'm say I didn't say that right where' you get the idea you got to be born again to be saved amen right now the only person that God then not going to impute sin is that person that is born again right that's right all right y cuz others will be imputed someday right but to watch their own judgment they'll have to give an account of the Deeds right I just want to make sure I'm right here don't you the Lord forgive me we want to be so conscious of that right I said Lord forgive me well because he's our father amen he doesn't see us Lord we're covered by the blood of Jesus Christ the bumper blood he only hears their voice saying father forgive me you know that brother around said when you go out and listen you want this quote he said you go out and do something wrong he said and he said it comes over you and said you immediately you know you you feel sorry for what you he said it's already been taken care of Amen thank you L now that's his word he said it's already been taken care of why because God knew your repentant heart would be there but what about how he saw us before the world what about that that the way he sees us now is the way he saw us before the world let's see if I can find that one be witness Rec if I can find it yeah number four Brother Anderson paragraph 50 of on the wings of a snow white dove 1965 11:28 look what he said and that's the way with a real Christian did you know a real Christian doesn't have even any sin at all imputed to him David said blessed is the man to whom God will not impute sin too when you're washed in the blood of the Lamb not by make belief but really the the blood of the Lamb God does not impute to you anything that's done right listen why because you're under the blood and he doesn't see it right there's a blood sacrifice the only thing he can see you in is the way he saw you before for the foundation of the world when he put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life that's all he can look at because you are redeemed from everything that was ever done you're washed in the blood of the Lamb therefore there's no G in you there's no unclean Habit in you because that blood of the Lamb has did this and God cannot impute sin to you after you've got a sin offering laying they waiting for you well you said say that gives you say that gives me plenty of room then brother brandom I can do what I want to do want to I always do always but when a man can really see what Jesus done for him and turn around and do something wrong contrary to him it shows he never received Christ and that would be the essence of the whole message that I've tried to bring how did he see you before the world right well now brother Dale you preached to us and all that we wouldn't back Earth people I great all right well there's only the eternal life I agree with you but don't you think before the world that God saw absolutely this whole unit that I am right amen yep huh but he saw this unit and how repented it would be of what it's done did you just see a spook or floating around or walk before the world we wouldn't back to our people come on right but what were we we were part of God right right but in part of God then he knew he had children yep and he knew he was going to put the children in flesh right amen right do we ever have God looked at you before the world's where he's looking at you now see like I said that order to make us to where we could crawl under a concrete block with a 10 gon hat on and not touch the thing yes it order to Humble us yes amen instead of bringing us up well if I believe that that sounds more like greasy Grace no you ain't never heard brother Dale preach nothing that wound up in the greasy Grace that's right amen because I don't try to justify you or myself I believe in the covering amen I believe in atonement right I believe in God forgiveness amen that's right brother Dale you forgive me that's sure I can forgive you all day long that don't that don't change nothing but if God for issue that's right see a lot of people wants a preacher to say something you know they want him to make some commitment I think you're saved well I you know I might think you are but yeah that ain't got nothing to do with you right that's right that's between you and God amen amen just still with it that way but you see the prophet said as he saw you before the world right well now in his mind could he not see where that the seed would land in his plan of predestination yep absolutely would he not be able to look right down to where we are right now I righty you remember the quote that we used about two or three times there brother around 336 of the church age book said thereby he could look down through time and see himself as being the beginning of the creation of God in this age right amen what about it right what about a blood atonement they had a natural atonement back there yep right we have an eternal now let's make sure you understand what I'm saying and don't get on the Covenant some we don't have an eternal Covenant right there's no such thing an eternal Covenant you may believe they are but it's not it's a covenant for time right you may read the scriptures and think but it's not the prophet of God said we have an Covenant but it's only for time he said because when we step back over there we don't need the Covenant so the Covenant is not Eternal right oh I got an eternal Covenant well all right that's all right you talking about eternal life but right when you get down to really nitty-gritty the Covenant is not Eternal because once you're totally redeemed you don't need a covenant anymore right and see then that way if the Covenant was eternal you'd still need a covenant down through time right so we don't need it just G if if we can solve the problem here and that's what I believe can be done right I believe somebody can come to this to the place here upon this Earth to realize by revelation that they're perfectly totally sinless right in the sight of God right amen we'll never be in the sight of mankind you want that quote that's right never be in the sight of mankind we'll never be in the sight of one another right oh my right right amen we'll never be in the sight of one another even though we can say everyone here is a born again Christian CHR right will never be that inside of one another but inside of God so then blessed is the man now remember the statement I brought it over and over and over and over and over and over the Born Again Believer cannot sin right so David is speaking of some of a situation and Paul is speaking of a situation so then can I state it this way and then you take it and apply to blessed is the man that can believe he's covered right amen by the blood of Jesus Christ right right amen that's it because that man then will not have sin imputed right amen well that sounds like you're saying it's open might sound like a lot of things but is it true blessed is the man that can realize he's under the [Music] covering one of these days I want to preach on that because for many years I've been looking at something why is it that a human mortal I'm talking about all over the world talking about any Christians that a human mortal will try to find some kind of a god totem fold images alligators um volcanoes right you know some kind of a something right that they'll appease try to appease that God by even throwing their children to the alligator or throwing them down a Volcan a volcano you know to try to stop it why is that that way it doesn't matter whether they've heard of God or not right you know was even a surprise when the white man first went to to the jungles of Africa and uh began to find people back there that you know what they had they had a mother son worship never heard of the Catholic church that was a big surprise CU you see all of this comes down to a spiritual reals right Mankind's always tried in every way he can to appease God yep whether it be a totem po God or whether it be whatever it is you see that's silly about a pole is is Jesus Christ any different than totem pole if you don't have him inside of you there's no difference that's right that's right if you don't have a new birth there's no difference in the totem pole and talking about Jesus Christ right that's why the people of this message have no Fey they say Jesus done wrong they say Jesus wouldn't god Till here they said all of these things yeah well because they have no fear because they're looking at him like a totem pole not another human being let me put it that way where you'll understand yeah you're looking at him like a looking at a quote right in our minute ago brother said see there said he was just a man to the River Jordan and they'll take them and just run hog wildly yep I can look at and I say Amen sure abely noce the River Jordan was a special time right that's when God and man united in his fullness according to Prophet but I like the way he said it he said it was the greatest time that ever happened at the river Jordan outside of this a you remember that quote outside of this age that's right that was the greatest thing that ever happened amen why because God and man's going to be one again amen when we begin to realize what the blood is doing for us to keep us covered right you're not saved by the blood you're kept saved by it right you're covered by it until God will not annihilate us if you have any any bir amen blessed is the man to whom God will not impute sin a person that has the new birth standing with the blood of Jesus Christ stands perfectly totally sinless in the presence of God y amen what about it come on come on Brothers I just left all the quotes off other than that one cuz I just I really didn't know which way I was going to bring all of it out cuz I really I'm I'm I'm still to the point that I'd like to preach about 4 hours now to make sure you understand what I'm talking about amen we believe in being right and living right and doing right and repenting when we do wrong right and staying on the blood of Jesus Christ that's right because that's part of the plan and we are his children amen how wonderful to think about that's right and it's not that he loves his children so much he don't impute he made a way that his children by having his nature would understand what their father meant you agree with that statement right he knew his children by having his nature right by the new birth would come to his nature in Body Spirit and soul because remember he could be tempted also right but did he sin no so it's not wrong to be tempted it's wrong to yield to Temptation right that come these things what do you think about it what does it mean to be perfect when we'll never be perfect in No Man's eyes that's right but in God's eyes we are the Bride of Jesus Christ perfect right so wonderful he's when he connects with her in his Union to take her away until you know what the Millennium Temple will be erected in the Millennium and you know we will come back in the millennial ride according to Revelations 19 and according to brother Brandon I believe it's Daniel 70 weeks he said we will be the anointing to that Temple amen that's how much it can't be separated amen you can't separate him and her right because one am what we got bl's name 21 Christ Our [Music] redem all you with the blood of lamb and for you I the people that wrote These song about the blood they bleed so much in that until they the strong about the God looked down at that time said I have a group of people the end time they can sing this song and know what the blood do see they
