[0:00] foreign
[0:03] God bless you thanks it's good to be in
[0:05] the house of the Lord this morning
[0:07] we're still continuing on in Hebrews 12.
[0:13] I just want to kind of set the stage
[0:14] with this scripture to get things
[0:16] started this morning let's bow our heads
[0:18] Lord God we're so grateful to be able to
[0:20] gather together this morning and look
[0:21] into your word as we study these things
[0:23] out I pray Lord that your lord just
[0:25] minister to the needs of the people Lord
[0:27] God and give us something Lord and
[0:28] encourage us and edifice Lord and build
[0:30] up our faith that we can believe A
[0:32] Little Bit Stronger Lord every step we
[0:34] take Closer to You Lord pray God that
[0:37] you'll just be your brother wait as he's
[0:38] study and prepared and open our hearts
[0:40] door to to receive the word that you
[0:41] have for us today we ask this blessing
[0:44] in your name
[0:46] now Psalm uh of course just to set the
[0:49] stage for Hebrews 12 14 and 15 that
[0:51] we're kind of looking at um and I just
[0:53] really want to speak on contentment this
[0:55] morning just about what contentment
[0:57] means because a lot of times we were we
[0:59] were talking last Sunday about how
[1:01] unrealistic expectations kind of fuel
[1:03] bitterness and so forth and and all of
[1:05] that kind of comes from a place of where
[1:07] you're not you're not satisfied you're
[1:10] not content with who you are and your
[1:12] relationship with God and you know you
[1:14] look at this picture of the Lord is my
[1:16] shepherd I shall not want with with the
[1:18] shepherd watching over the sheep and
[1:20] um you know if you're if you're just
[1:22] relying if you're in a place where you
[1:24] have confidence that your Shepherd is
[1:26] watching over you
[1:28] um you know that'll bring a place of
[1:30] contentment I think sometimes we as
[1:32] going through life we kind of forget we
[1:34] we rely so much on the opinions of
[1:36] others and the opinions of even
[1:37] ourselves or what we think about ourself
[1:39] that we forget that there's a God that's
[1:41] Watching Over Us and really when we come
[1:42] to church and we gather together we we
[1:45] what we're really trying to do is we're
[1:46] trying to please God
[1:48] as long as God is satisfied that's all
[1:51] that matters and that's maybe my point
[1:53] is as long as God is the one that's
[1:56] pleased you know when we're if he's
[1:58] pleased by the preaching of the word
[1:59] he's pleased by our attitudes if he's
[2:02] pleased by everything that we do then
[2:05] that's all that matters because we've
[2:06] got a Shepherd that's Watching Over Us
[2:09] um you know this is what uh I just kind
[2:11] of read this little scripture from First
[2:13] Corinthians chapter four this is what
[2:14] Paul was trying to express to the
[2:16] Corinthians when they they kind of were
[2:18] some of them began to have favorites
[2:21] that they they began to look at Paul and
[2:22] Apollos and Peter and say well I think I
[2:25] think maybe Peter has a little bit more
[2:27] uh he he's his motives are better he's
[2:29] got better motives and maybe Paul does
[2:31] or maybe I like Paul Apollos the way he
[2:33] can kind of spin the word out in a way
[2:35] that is maybe easier for me to grasp and
[2:38] look at what Paul said he said this is
[2:40] how one should regard us as Servants of
[2:42] Christ and stewards of the mysteries of
[2:44] God moreover it is required of stewards
[2:47] that be found they be found faithful but
[2:49] with me it is a very small thing that I
[2:52] should be judged by you or by any human
[2:54] core now look at look to the way that
[2:57] Paul is kind of framing the way that he
[2:59] looks at things he's he's he he said
[3:02] it's a small thing that I should be
[3:03] judged by your opinion in fact I did not
[3:07] even judge myself now isn't that true
[3:09] that sometimes our our own opinions of
[3:12] ourselves can be can be elevated or be
[3:14] too critical that sometimes I mean you
[3:17] look at you look at the way that even
[3:19] people that have left the message their
[3:21] opinion of themselves is wrong because
[3:23] they if they really were comparing
[3:25] themselves with the word they would see
[3:26] that they didn't match up with the words
[3:27] you see sometimes our opinions of
[3:29] ourselves as even even off the mark but
[3:32] what the opinion that matters is God's
[3:34] opinion of us he's saying with me it is
[3:37] a very small thing that I should be
[3:38] judged by you or by any human Court in
[3:40] fact that I do not even judge myself for
[3:42] I am not aware of anything against
[3:44] myself but I am not thereby acquitted
[3:46] just because I'm not aware of anything
[3:47] within myself doesn't mean that I'm
[3:49] Guiltless it's the Lord It's the Lord's
[3:52] opinion who matters his his opinion is
[3:55] the one that matters therefore judge
[3:57] nothing before the time don't be quick
[3:58] to judge somebody's motives or their
[4:00] character or something before just give
[4:01] it a little bit of time until the Lord
[4:03] come who both will bring to light the
[4:05] hidden things of darkness and will make
[4:07] manifest the councils of the hearts and
[4:09] then shall every man have Praise of God
[4:11] so we're talking about contentment this
[4:13] morning and talking about judging and
[4:15] last time we were talking about really
[4:17] if you really want to be able to
[4:18] understand things and understand one
[4:20] another and understand how things work
[4:22] is first you must first understand
[4:25] yourself
[4:26] and that's what Jesus was talking about
[4:28] when he said this this one of the most
[4:30] misunderstood scriptures in the Bible
[4:33] maybe maybe as we read this think about
[4:35] do you do you what do you think this
[4:37] scripture means as we read it in Matthew
[4:39] chapter 7 he said judge not
[4:42] that ye be not judged now a lot of times
[4:45] we'll think we'll think well that means
[4:47] that we we can't discern right from
[4:49] wrong because Jesus said judge not that
[4:51] you be not judge that's not what this is
[4:52] saying is saying judge yourself first
[4:55] judge yourself first before you uh and
[4:58] let's let's read this and see what see
[5:00] what he says for with what judgment you
[5:02] judge
[5:03] you shall be judged now think of it as a
[5:06] big spotlight
[5:07] when you start to judge somebody else
[5:09] the spotlight turns on you because if
[5:12] you say someone is guilty now the
[5:14] spotlight is turned on you and everybody
[5:17] not just God but every let's say maybe
[5:20] you're sitting at a table and you begin
[5:21] to point out somebody's faults all of a
[5:23] sudden the spotlight is turned on you
[5:25] to expose whether you are guilty of the
[5:28] same thing that you are speaking of
[5:30] judge not that ye be not judged for with
[5:33] what judgment you judge ye shall be
[5:34] judged and with what measure you meet it
[5:36] shall be measured to you again
[5:38] and why behold us thou the moat that is
[5:40] in thy brother's eye but considers not
[5:42] the beam that is in thine own eye or how
[5:45] will thou say to thy brother let me pull
[5:47] out the mode out of thine eye and behold
[5:48] a beam is in thine own eye thou
[5:51] hypocrite First cast out the beam out of
[5:53] thine old eye and then Thou shalt See
[5:54] Clearly to cast out the mood out of thy
[5:56] brother's eye
[5:57] now look what he's talking about casting
[5:59] something out I think it's called in my
[6:01] mind just right now in this moment that
[6:04] um
[6:04] I'm thinking of a brother at another
[6:07] church that was delivered of pornography
[6:09] addiction years ago and now as a
[6:11] minister now you could say well he's not
[6:14] guilty of looking at pornography now but
[6:17] he has because he went through that
[6:18] experience now he's better positioned to
[6:21] be able to cash that thing out of of
[6:24] young people and that's what you see
[6:25] when he'll um be standing in a prayer
[6:28] line he has that he has that special
[6:30] burden as somebody comes through the
[6:32] prayer line to when somebody's Afflicted
[6:35] with that pornography addiction to be
[6:37] able to deal with that in a special way
[6:39] now there's somebody that's they're not
[6:41] looking at they're able to judge fairly
[6:43] and correctly because they've been
[6:45] delivered in the same way that you know
[6:47] if if you haven't been if you don't
[6:49] haven't really been uh if you've never
[6:51] received a real relationship with God
[6:53] and haven't been to that been to that
[6:55] burning bush like Moses typed how are
[6:57] you able to help somebody that has not
[7:00] been themselves you you gotta see if
[7:03] you're judge yourself first and then
[7:05] you're then you're able to help somebody
[7:07] else now now that's what uh in Hebrews
[7:10] chapter 12 it says follow peace with all
[7:12] men and Holiness without which no man
[7:15] shall see the Lord looking diligently
[7:18] lest any man fail of the grace of God
[7:20] grace of God lest any root of bitterness
[7:22] bringing up trouble you and thereby many
[7:25] be defiled now there's how that we were
[7:29] examining this last last Sunday how does
[7:31] bitterness spring up bitterness Springs
[7:33] up when it it all comes down to your
[7:36] perception of your how the way that
[7:38] you're looking at things in the church
[7:40] and your relationships at yourself it
[7:44] all comes down to unrealistic
[7:46] expectations our premeditated resentment
[7:48] now let's kind of level set for that
[7:51] second when we come to church we have
[7:53] great expectations of God I he's he owns
[7:56] the cattle on a thousand hills so we can
[7:58] have an expectation that God is going to
[8:00] meet our need brother random even say
[8:01] when you come to church you you have
[8:03] you're going to get what you expect you
[8:05] can come with a critical mindset or you
[8:06] can come expect it I'm going to get a
[8:08] blessing today because God is God is
[8:11] going to meet his promise when if God
[8:13] promised something and you come with
[8:15] according to the prescription you can
[8:16] come with confidence that God is going
[8:18] to meet your expectation but you got to
[8:21] remember that we're all human so we we
[8:24] need to level set our expectations of
[8:26] one another now that's what this is
[8:27] talking about let's go through some
[8:29] examples
[8:31] when we hold rigid and unrealistic
[8:34] expectations of others or situations we
[8:37] set ourselves up for disappointment and
[8:39] resentment when those expectations are
[8:40] not met
[8:42] it's natural to have certain
[8:43] expectations in life we should approach
[8:45] them with flexibility understanding and
[8:48] Grace so what what this is talking about
[8:50] is sometimes you just got to let things
[8:52] roll off your back
[8:54] sometimes you just gotta say
[8:56] oh well now now if if some of y'all know
[8:59] me a little bit more y'all know that's
[9:00] one of my the things that I like to say
[9:01] is like something happens and you
[9:04] oh well and brother Louise back there
[9:07] he'll say well you'll have that that's
[9:09] you know sometimes you just gotta
[9:12] somebody says something a little bit
[9:14] unexpected something strange happens all
[9:17] right oh well that's life we just keep
[9:19] rolling on and let's look at some things
[9:21] what it's unrealistic to expect that you
[9:25] will get constant praise and admiration
[9:27] now see how and as an adult it will be
[9:30] unrealistic for you to come to church
[9:31] and to constantly expect someone to
[9:33] praise you to praise me after every
[9:35] Sunday school lesson brother Bob that
[9:37] was a wonderful Sunday school lesson
[9:38] well that's you know it's great to get
[9:41] past On The Backs but it would be
[9:42] unrealistic to expect that ever every
[9:44] time you preach
[9:46] or every time you sing a song or every
[9:48] time you it's your birthday or whatever
[9:51] and you see how this flows down into
[9:53] parenting as well
[9:55] as a parent you you've got to set you're
[10:00] setting your kids up so that they so
[10:02] that they don't have those kind of
[10:04] unrealistic expectations because it's
[10:06] unrealistic for them to go to school and
[10:08] everybody's constantly patting them on
[10:10] the back because they they ran a race
[10:12] but they didn't win and they're they're
[10:13] getting a prize it's unrealistic and you
[10:15] see what happens when you've got those
[10:17] unrealistic expectations and you go into
[10:19] a situation and those expectations
[10:21] aren't met then you start getting bitter
[10:23] you start getting bitter because of my
[10:25] maybe you know uh I I remember somebody
[10:28] telling me about a preacher that went to
[10:30] a church and was a really big church and
[10:33] and lo and behold he didn't he didn't
[10:34] get invited to preach well he had
[10:36] unrealistic expectations that just
[10:38] because he was there that he would get
[10:40] invited to preach you gotta you gotta
[10:42] kind of set set your expectations
[10:44] realistically that just because you're
[10:46] there everybody's not going to pour
[10:48] praise and admiration on you and tell
[10:50] you that you're the greatest thing in
[10:51] the world it's unrealistic to expect
[10:53] that
[10:54] and so and it's important to experience
[10:57] constructive feedback and learn how to
[10:59] handle both positive and negative
[11:00] evaluations it's unrealistic to for a
[11:03] child to go on the playground and expect
[11:05] that everybody will run up to them and
[11:07] want to play exactly the same way that
[11:09] they want to do it's unrealistic for me
[11:11] as I'm preaching to expect that
[11:12] everybody will have the same background
[11:14] the same thought processes and look at
[11:16] things the same way and you see that's
[11:19] where that's where bitterness comes from
[11:22] it's only realistic to expect special
[11:25] treatment or entitlement that belief
[11:27] that you or your child should always
[11:29] receive preferential treatment or
[11:31] special privileges
[11:33] fairness and equality are essential
[11:36] values in society
[11:38] it's unrealistic to expect that that
[11:40] you'll be protected from all negative
[11:42] influences
[11:44] how we how we do sometimes we we just
[11:47] kind of uh it shocks us when something
[11:49] negative happens when somebody tells us
[11:51] something that we don't like or
[11:53] especially when somebody tells one of
[11:55] our children something that they don't
[11:57] like
[11:57] like uh I I just kind of been meditating
[12:00] on how uh
[12:03] there's a quote where Jordan Peterson
[12:05] says it's amazing how how horrible
[12:07] people can be to one another and I've
[12:09] been meditating on as I've looked kind
[12:11] of uh looking into these things about
[12:13] really how horrible young people can be
[12:15] to one another you look at uh I I uh
[12:19] somebody was sharing me with me recently
[12:21] about how a young person they had
[12:23] actually a lot of these young people
[12:25] they go to camps and everything and they
[12:26] start getting bad feelings toward one
[12:28] another and a group of young people
[12:30] actually started a whole chat group so
[12:32] that they could Mock and and poke at
[12:34] somebody and you think about all the
[12:36] things that that people go through you
[12:38] you can't but you can't go through life
[12:39] expecting that these things will not
[12:41] happen you got to go through with
[12:42] realistic expectations because the way
[12:45] to combat that the way to combat these
[12:48] these negative things that people say
[12:50] and constant poking is to be content
[12:53] with your situation that's what I'm
[12:54] talking about this morning
[12:55] to be content
[12:58] that Paul said or James said what causes
[13:00] fights and quarrels among you don't they
[13:03] come from your desires that battle
[13:04] within you you desire but do not have so
[13:07] you kill you cover but you cannot get
[13:09] what you want so you quarrel and fight
[13:11] you do not have because you've done that
[13:12] do not ask God when you ask you do not
[13:15] receive because you ask with wrong
[13:16] motives and so on and so forth it's
[13:18] those desires bitterness that comes and
[13:21] Jehovah Jireh or brother I'm saying we
[13:23] know that a seed when it falls in the
[13:25] right kind of ground not upon rocks with
[13:27] no root nor in thorns and thistles that
[13:29] would soon choke it out but in good Rich
[13:30] fertile Faith every seed will bring
[13:33] forth of its kind and we know that every
[13:36] seed or promise of God will bring forth
[13:38] of his kind what it promised if it
[13:41] strikes the right ground the ground
[13:43] that's prepared ready all the Rocks has
[13:45] been thrown out and The Roots and the
[13:47] bitterness and selfishness and
[13:49] indifference and jealousy has all been
[13:51] grouped out
[13:52] that root of bitterness that Springs up
[13:54] that sometimes so spoils the thing that
[13:57] God is trying to do and I'll tell you
[14:00] it's bitterness bitterness will start
[14:01] when somebody who are you taking a
[14:03] little kid and they're having a
[14:04] conversation and one kid says well why
[14:06] is your face so round or why is your
[14:08] face so long or just starts poking and
[14:10] stuff and all that'll start something
[14:12] will have to start happening start
[14:14] making fun of one another oh but there's
[14:17] what I'm what I'm talking about is
[14:18] there's an antidote for all those things
[14:20] you because you've got to come to you've
[14:23] got to come to a place like Jesus where
[14:25] somebody can say something to you and it
[14:26] doesn't affect you if something affects
[14:28] you when somebody says something it
[14:30] shows there's something a little bit
[14:31] spiritually off if something vibrates
[14:33] there's something off kilter you've got
[14:35] to come to a place where it doesn't
[14:37] affect you because you know you got a
[14:39] shepherd and he's got your back and he's
[14:41] watching over you
[14:44] I'm speaking something that'll help you
[14:47] this morning let's let's look at let's
[14:49] look at all these stages of bitterness
[14:51] first off is you somebody said something
[14:53] hurtful something that you're just like
[14:55] why what what is going on and it starts
[14:58] starts bitterness growing it turns into
[15:00] resentment rumination where you're just
[15:02] thinking about it every day until you're
[15:05] holding this big grudge and then finally
[15:06] now this is where Boolean comes from now
[15:09] you're trying to manipulate others
[15:11] you're trying to poke and and make fun
[15:13] of the way that they look oh that's what
[15:15] bullying is and making fun of somebody
[15:16] because they're sick
[15:18] something that they can't help the way
[15:21] that they they've got a limp and they
[15:23] can't walk right something maybe they're
[15:25] you feel like there's they they uh
[15:27] they're
[15:28] somebody a young person feels like
[15:30] somebody else is
[15:32] um different than they are so they're
[15:34] going to poke at that thing to try to
[15:36] control the situation because you don't
[15:38] feel that you're controlling control of
[15:40] your own life so you can try to control
[15:42] the relationships through bullying and
[15:44] manipulation
[15:45] until it escalates on into hurtful
[15:47] Behavior where you're spreading rumors
[15:49] and gossip and self-harm I I I I I I oh
[15:53] you could preach all day about the
[15:56] things that young people go through
[15:57] where another story that is coming to my
[15:59] mind right now is this um a young person
[16:02] what they'll do is they'll they'll get
[16:04] online as Anonymous and then they'll
[16:06] start dragging one another through the
[16:08] mud and you won't know who it is who is
[16:11] that and they'll start spreading rumors
[16:13] and gossip and and horrible things about
[16:16] one another now that's you know that's
[16:18] one thing when it's a child but let that
[16:21] person grow on up if they're if it's not
[16:23] corrected or something before long it's
[16:24] an adult that's behaving the same way
[16:27] and that's that's terrible that is
[16:31] terrible
[16:32] so what we got to do is be content be
[16:36] content with who we are that's what this
[16:38] gospel is for to be content with who you
[16:40] are and who God has made to know that
[16:42] you've got a God that's watching over
[16:43] the situation and that same God that was
[16:46] able to correct you is able to correct
[16:48] your brother
[16:50] in Philippians chapter four he said not
[16:52] that I speak in respect of want for I
[16:54] have learned and whatsoever State I am
[16:57] therewith to be content
[16:59] now this is another artificial
[17:01] intelligence generated image I just
[17:03] asked it to make me a picture of a good
[17:05] Holiness sister that's content with
[17:08] herself look at what brother what Paul
[17:11] is saying about this now he said I know
[17:13] both how to be a beast
[17:15] now can we say that same thing about it
[17:17] I know how to be in a bad situation
[17:20] and I know how to abound I know how to
[17:22] be in a good situation
[17:24] I know in my mind how to approach that
[17:28] situation so that I'm not lifted up
[17:29] within myself or I'm not looking at
[17:31] things off kilter that I'm just wherever
[17:34] I am whatever state I am I'm content now
[17:37] now I I know maybe this is what might
[17:40] seem a little bit boring or whatever but
[17:42] this is one of the greatest blessings
[17:44] that you can get from the baptism the
[17:46] Holy Ghost to be happy if all you've got
[17:50] now what maybe happy is the wrong word
[17:52] because happy can come from external
[17:54] situations and whatever I'm not talking
[17:55] about happy where one day you're happy
[17:57] and one day you're sad I'm talking about
[17:58] that's inner state of joy that is just
[18:02] constant amen if you're laying in a
[18:04] hospital bed it's constant you're it's
[18:07] there if you're if you're up on the
[18:10] Mountaintop it's there if you're down in
[18:12] the valley it's there that's what I'm
[18:14] talking about he said I know both how to
[18:16] be a beast and I know how to abound
[18:19] everywhere and in all things I am
[18:22] instructed both to be full and to be
[18:24] hungry both to abound and to suffer need
[18:28] now there's there's a there's real
[18:31] Christian character on display where
[18:34] you've got all the bitterness rooted out
[18:36] you got all that jealousy root oh that
[18:38] that would make a good study what
[18:39] jealousy is brother Adam said jealousy
[18:42] comes from Satan and jealous is that can
[18:44] well you can identify that when you
[18:46] begin to compare yourself with others oh
[18:48] but God don't want you to compare
[18:50] yourself with others just look at the
[18:52] word and be content with what the word
[18:54] says about you when you can begin to
[18:56] identify yourself with the word and that
[18:58] will give you confidence of where you
[19:00] are positionally in Christ that you've
[19:02] got a god who's watching over you
[19:04] and and that will mold your character
[19:07] into a place where you don't poke and
[19:09] you don't hurt and you don't say hurtful
[19:12] things into a character where other
[19:14] people can look at you and see a real
[19:16] Christian
[19:17] character is what it's all about
[19:20] that's why brother Adam said power apart
[19:22] from character is satanic but Power with
[19:25] with character is fit to rule you ever
[19:27] think about that you think you go to
[19:28] Walmart and you see a manager at Walmart
[19:30] and a lot of times the employees maybe
[19:32] they got cancer and they can I get some
[19:34] time off and power without character
[19:37] they're a man they're a manager over
[19:38] people but they don't have any character
[19:40] so no you gotta you gotta be in here
[19:42] tomorrow but I got I'm dealing with
[19:45] cancer oh my mom just died or whatever
[19:46] but they have no character so power
[19:49] without character is satanic
[19:53] look at all these quotes where people
[19:55] down through history have talked about
[19:57] character Abraham Lincoln said nearly
[19:59] all men can stand adversity
[20:01] but if you want to test a man's carriage
[20:03] or give him power
[20:05] Lord Acton said power tends to corrupt
[20:08] and absolute power corrupts absolutely
[20:10] you know you can see that even in the
[20:12] workplace look look at your boss do they
[20:15] have a real character are they are they
[20:18] kind and forgiving or you know I'm I'm
[20:21] speaking even outside of Christianity or
[20:24] when you when you ask for time off
[20:26] or or have a problem in your life
[20:28] Booker T Washington said character not
[20:31] circumstances makes the man and George
[20:33] Washington said happiness and moral duty
[20:35] are inseparably connected Aristotle said
[20:38] character maybe May almost be called the
[20:41] most effective means of persuasion in
[20:44] other words if you want to persuade
[20:46] somebody to be a Christian put your life
[20:48] on display where somebody can see your
[20:51] character the way that you treat other
[20:53] people that's what he's talking the way
[20:54] that you the way that you're willing to
[20:56] help the way that you're willing to go
[20:58] pick up chairs and move around their
[21:00] character on display
[21:04] brother William said that you and the
[21:05] unity of one God and the one church he
[21:07] said these signs shall follow Believers
[21:09] not negative thinkers not intellectual
[21:11] church members but born again Believers
[21:14] who's come from the intellectual to the
[21:15] heart where God takes throne and his
[21:18] control room to control your emotions to
[21:21] control your faith
[21:23] to control your character
[21:26] and the message life he said now the
[21:28] Christian church should have a real
[21:30] character then and if the Life of Christ
[21:32] is in the Church of Christ then it's God
[21:35] to have the character of Christ
[21:37] it'll produce the Life of Christ it's
[21:40] just no more than just what we call in
[21:42] the South Common Sense if the life of
[21:45] the spirit of Christ is in the church it
[21:47] has to produce that life because the
[21:49] life
[21:50] that's in you makes your character
[21:54] now you see you see what the statute of
[21:56] perfect man really is about when you're
[21:58] born again now your position to believe
[22:00] the faith of God is in you but now the
[22:03] character starts pushing out to make you
[22:05] like Christ what does that look like
[22:09] Christian characters love and joy and
[22:12] peace and patience and kindness and
[22:15] goodness and faithfulness and gentleness
[22:17] and self-control and humility and
[22:19] forgiveness and honesty and generosity
[22:21] and servanthood and obedience and
[22:23] compassion and contentment and courage
[22:25] and modesty and steadfastness and you
[22:27] can go on and on and on as you look for
[22:29] the things that reflect Jesus Christ in
[22:32] you
[22:34] brother Ram said in the mighty conqueror
[22:36] he said many times that people judge
[22:38] people by the way they dress or by their
[22:40] stature man is not judged by how big he
[22:42] is and how strong his muscles man's
[22:45] judged by character
[22:46] and character alone
[22:48] I've seen men that weighed 200 pounds
[22:51] that didn't have an ounce of man about
[22:52] them man is judged by character what he
[22:55] is in his heart and Christ was not
[22:58] judged by physical strength but he was
[23:00] judged by character
[23:02] and in time-tested Memorials of God he
[23:05] said you see a man's character is made
[23:07] known by his works whatever you are your
[23:10] Works prove what you are no matter how
[23:13] much you testify whatever you say Pro or
[23:16] con that has nothing to do with it your
[23:18] Works tell what you are tell us what you
[23:20] are inside every job that you do
[23:23] manifests what you are and you
[23:25] businessmen if you just do a patched up
[23:27] job see what I mean just a halfway job
[23:29] don't do that if you can't do it right
[23:31] don't do it at all that's right when you
[23:34] come to Christ if you can't absolutely
[23:36] sell out Lock Stock and Barrel and come
[23:39] to Christ don't come at all but when you
[23:42] really want to be a Christian Stand Out
[23:44] make it real that's what God wants you
[23:46] to be and that'll prove your Works will
[23:49] prove what your character is your
[23:51] character is known by The Works that you
[23:55] do
[23:58] so let's be content
[24:00] and brother Brown said in believer style
[24:01] this he said and he came to this world
[24:03] as my example
[24:04] and he came as your example to just be
[24:07] content with such as we have
[24:10] and Luke chapter 3 it says and the
[24:12] soldiers likewise demanded of him saying
[24:14] and what shall we do and he said unto
[24:16] them do violence to no man neither
[24:18] accuse any falsely and be content with
[24:22] your wages
[24:23] that's one thing I've even noticed at
[24:25] work no matter how much it seems like
[24:27] people make how much more money you give
[24:29] somebody it's like they never are
[24:31] content
[24:32] people just it's so hard to be content
[24:34] with what you got
[24:35] in Philippians chapter 3 not that I
[24:37] speak in respect of want for I have
[24:39] learned and whatsoever State I am there
[24:42] with to be content
[24:43] and Hebrews 13 5 let your conversation
[24:46] be without covetousness and be content
[24:49] with such things as you have for he hath
[24:51] said I will never leave thee nor forsake
[24:54] thee now think about that let your
[24:57] conversation be without covetousness
[24:59] without any bitterness without any
[25:02] jealousy that comes from not being
[25:05] content with who you are
[25:07] God wants you to be content God wants
[25:10] you to be satisfied if you've got a
[25:12] personal relationship with God it
[25:14] doesn't matter what people say to you or
[25:16] what people's opinions are of you
[25:17] because you've got a father that's got
[25:19] your back and you know where you come
[25:21] from oh that's I I think that you think
[25:25] of those stories that brother Adam said
[25:27] told us as we close about like like the
[25:29] little Eagle that he saw as he was went
[25:31] out into the Wilderness with a little
[25:33] squirrel chattering away telling telling
[25:36] that eagle the days of Miracles are
[25:38] passed and you think about all the
[25:39] things that the devil can say and maybe
[25:41] maybe even the devil through different
[25:43] people or whatever as they come and tell
[25:44] you things well well you're not even
[25:47] really a Christian or you're not even
[25:49] this or whatever but oh you've got to
[25:51] rise above that to where you can be like
[25:53] that eagle and just spread your wings
[25:55] and fly away while that squirrel
[25:58] Chatters away that's real contentment
[26:00] where you can rest upon what God has
[26:03] said
[26:04] God bless you we'll stop right there
[26:06] [Applause]
