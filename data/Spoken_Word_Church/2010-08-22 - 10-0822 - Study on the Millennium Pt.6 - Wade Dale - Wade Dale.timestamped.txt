[0:03] okay I was thinking this morning about
[0:06] something to do and thinking about
[0:08] something to do and thinking about
[0:09] something to do I just think this is
[0:12] what we're going to
[0:15] do we're going since we did a comparison
[0:19] and we got some good notes back on the
[0:20] internet about the comparison between
[0:22] the future home and the Millennium I
[0:24] think we're going to do a comparison on
[0:27] what is the Son of God and what is the
[0:28] son of man M
[0:32] cuz truth be known probably in the
[0:35] message of the hour there's not many
[0:37] people know the
[0:38] difference or where one started and
[0:40] where one ended or where one what this
[0:44] one does and what that one does now we
[0:45] know for a
[0:47] fact that it's both God right okay
[0:52] there's not two Gods it's not this one
[0:56] he become that one and no he was God all
[0:59] the time
[1:00] okay so but there is a time where the
[1:03] Son of God begin and there's a time
[1:06] where the son of man begin right
[1:11] right as far as we're concerned now
[1:13] remember when I say we're concerned it's
[1:15] from what we see not what God is or what
[1:19] God sees because he was the son of God
[1:22] before the foundation of the world back
[1:23] in the
[1:25] eternity but he was not the son of
[1:28] man cuz he didn't have a flesh like he
[1:31] had down here on the Earth right so
[1:34] there's where we got to show the
[1:41] difference he was more real as a Son of
[1:44] God than anything
[1:46] but we're going to see the not the
[1:49] difference I don't like to say the
[1:50] difference cuz there's no difference in
[1:52] God right but the contrast between son
[1:55] of man Son of God because it's probably
[1:59] one of the most ill taught things in the
[2:01] in the
[2:02] message seeing people that believe that
[2:06] Abraham was the son of God by birth like
[2:08] you and I which there's no way he was
[2:10] cuz he didn't have the new birth right
[2:12] this man didn't die to release this life
[2:15] yet right to come back into the believer
[2:19] I don't understand it's just that even
[2:22] Baptist would tell you that that the
[2:24] blood of bulls and goats the Bible tells
[2:25] you doesn't do away with sin it just
[2:27] pushed it back so you can't be a son of
[2:29] of God in your soul until all of that's
[2:32] gone right right but we still got people
[2:36] and I meet them in the message that when
[2:37] you say that Abraham was not a son of
[2:39] God by birth like you and I it just they
[2:42] go cuckoo all right and want to argue
[2:46] and then they get into predestination
[2:48] and then they take
[2:49] predestination as I was always this seed
[2:52] over here and there's no way I could be
[2:54] this one over here well let's let God
[2:56] look at predestination that way but to
[2:57] you and I he looked by for knowledge
[3:01] right what you would do or wouldn't do
[3:03] and therefore he could come here and
[3:06] predestinate by what you desire that's
[3:09] right and I was thinking this morning
[3:13] you know I prove that Cain brother R
[3:16] said Cain had a choice the Bible said
[3:17] Cain had a choice because God's not a
[3:20] respector person he's not even a
[3:21] respector persons with with the devil
[3:27] right Satan you were born
[3:30] perfect Ezekiel 20 right 28 28 thank you
[3:34] Ezekiel 28 I look at sister Trudy
[3:36] because I always forget that but she
[3:37] showed it to me one time and I've always
[3:39] kept it in my Bible so Ezekiel 28 he
[3:42] said thou was born thou was created
[3:45] perfect so what did he do he made a
[3:47] choice right Satan made a choice cuz God
[3:51] made him to be the anointed chub right
[3:54] he become the Devil by the choice that
[3:56] he made all right cuz God didn't create
[3:58] evil that's right right he created a
[4:00] person that could become
[4:02] evil big difference cuz if God created
[4:06] evil then he could not come up and
[4:08] say you live like the devil all your
[4:10] life I'm going to put you in hell you
[4:12] couldn't do that right okay so I think
[4:14] we as in this
[4:17] room understand that but there's a lot
[4:19] of people listening maybe on the
[4:20] internet that we need to uh we're not
[4:23] trying to change anybody's idea because
[4:25] you cannot ever change anybody's idea
[4:27] God has to change your idea EXA right
[4:29] God has to reveal to you I can't reveal
[4:32] nothing I can just spark your interest
[4:34] for you to sit down and think about it
[4:36] and and look up quotes and look up
[4:38] scriptures and and let the Holy Spirit
[4:40] put it together um I can't put nothing
[4:43] together God's the one it has to do it
[4:46] so let's start and let's
[4:51] look at the Son of God turn to Genesis
[4:58] 1 and I'm a little ill prepared U my
[5:02] plant manager died last night at 2:00 in
[5:04] the morning
[5:06] so been kind of thinking about that a
[5:08] little bit so forgive me for not having
[5:11] all my scriptures lined up but maybe I
[5:14] can pull a few out of my head or God can
[5:16] bring them to our remembrance he said he
[5:17] would right
[5:19] right all
[5:21] right even if you have a scoffield Bible
[5:25] if you don't then I'm going to read some
[5:27] what scoffield said but and the first
[5:30] part here in
[5:33] Genesis we're going to look
[5:35] at
[5:37] God all right now what does Sun
[5:41] mean something begotten
[5:43] from all right something begotten from
[5:47] I'm the son of Samuel Dale because I was
[5:49] begotten from him all
[5:53] right
[5:55] now let's read in the beginning God
[5:58] created the Heaven Heaven and the
[6:01] Earth and the Earth was without form and
[6:04] void and darkness was upon the face of
[6:05] the deep and the spirit of God moved
[6:08] upon the face of the
[6:10] waters now the abis Scofield bible you
[6:13] can look in his commentary brother
[6:16] brandham was not the first one to come
[6:17] up with these words of Elohim and and
[6:20] self-existing God and all that it was
[6:23] the scholars knew that way back before
[6:24] brother random got
[6:26] here because I believe the Holy Ghost
[6:28] moved on people before the prophet got
[6:30] here it just took a prophet like brother
[6:32] brandham to put all that together and
[6:34] make it right they had they had the
[6:37] right sound but the composer had to come
[6:41] to bring the music together you can have
[6:43] all these you know different C's and B's
[6:45] and D's and a flats and all that but it
[6:48] took somebody to sit down and write it
[6:49] down and say hey this is where an A flat
[6:51] goes this is where you change this is
[6:53] you know he was the composer which we
[6:56] know it was the Holy Ghost in the man
[6:58] that was the composer not the man but he
[7:00] did yield himself so much till God could
[7:04] use him in a mighty
[7:06] way let's look at this son of
[7:09] God when you think of Son of God it is
[7:13] not the man that walks the shores of
[7:16] gall in that fullness of the person all
[7:19] right there's another part in there all
[7:22] right now we can say the man that walked
[7:25] the shores the shores of Galilee was the
[7:27] son of man with the Son of God in him
[7:31] right okay because he kept yielding to a
[7:34] higher power or to his father
[7:38] which his father was the one that was
[7:41] inside of him because remember he said
[7:42] he dwell in him right and I only do that
[7:45] what he
[7:47] says so the Son of God was the creator
[7:50] we know that by over in the other
[7:53] scriptures but let's
[7:54] look at what scofi said that word God
[8:01] in the Greek or the original translation
[8:05] is
[8:06] Elohim it's the English form which is
[8:09] God the first of the three primary names
[8:12] of deity is a uni plural noun formed
[8:14] from L which is strength or the strong
[8:17] one and
[8:18] Allah to swear to bind oneself by an
[8:21] oath so implying
[8:26] faithfulness because remember even
[8:29] Scopia watch this this unip plural this
[8:33] unip plurality implied in the name is
[8:37] directly asserted in Genesis
[8:39] 126 what do genesis 126 say let us make
[8:43] man in our image and in our likeness and
[8:47] let them so it's unip plural in the form
[8:51] of if we say I'm the son of Samuel Dale
[8:55] that's one person that's me there's
[8:57] nobody else can be that but in God if
[9:00] all of us were inside of him and all of
[9:02] the things that he was and still is was
[9:05] inside of him then he could say let us
[9:08] make man because what was he doing he
[9:10] was expanding
[9:12] himself he's the Creator we're
[9:16] not or Samuel Dale couldn't create
[9:18] another way Dale right but God can
[9:21] create as many sons as he wants to just
[9:23] like himself cuz that's what he's doing
[9:27] now Bible says he's create me Sons what
[9:29] unto
[9:34] himself but now watch we'll keep going
[9:38] on and he's not a see this is where
[9:41] scoffield gets sof say thus the Trinity
[9:43] is Leon in Elohim now let's change that
[9:47] word to
[9:49] trunity cuz brother Bram used the word
[9:52] Triune Triune is not bad Trinity is
[9:57] three Tri is one 2
[9:59] three all right triun being is three
[10:03] attributes of the same being so you
[10:06] don't have three gods in in the Trinity
[10:08] you have three Gods separate individual
[10:11] personalities trunity is Father Son and
[10:14] Holy Ghost this man right here that says
[10:16] in the beginning God created the Heaven
[10:18] and the Earth there's where he stood he
[10:20] was Father Son and Holy Ghost all bound
[10:22] up in one
[10:24] God then his attributes begin to he
[10:27] wanted to be a father
[10:29] is the reason that he had children all
[10:32] right his desire was was to have
[10:34] children right all
[10:36] right but I
[10:39] look in the beginning God created the
[10:42] Heaven and the
[10:44] Earth verse two and the Earth was that
[10:46] foreign
[10:47] void verse
[10:52] three there's a difference in verse
[10:55] three and verse
[10:57] one verse one say said God created that
[11:01] means he took something from nothing and
[11:04] made something with it right now verse
[11:06] three did not say God created that
[11:11] light God said let there be
[11:15] light in other words let there be
[11:18] understanding right let the light shine
[11:20] on something that's never Shone on
[11:22] before because you can't create God God
[11:25] is always light now you're going to see
[11:27] in a minute this is not the sun and the
[11:29] moon and the
[11:31] stars no no no he created that way over
[11:36] here
[11:38] okay then in verse 16 and God made two
[11:41] great
[11:42] lights one to shine at night one to
[11:44] shine day that's the Sun and the Moon
[11:46] that we have now all right but when he
[11:48] said let there be light and there was
[11:52] light that was not a creative act he was
[11:56] light all right so that that Son of God
[11:59] the Creator God was always light he was
[12:02] always God there was no darkness and the
[12:04] Bible said there was no darkness in him
[12:05] at
[12:06] all remember that John John 1 in the
[12:09] beginning was his word he was the light
[12:11] of the world and in him was no Darkness
[12:12] at all right so now and God saw the
[12:16] light it was good and God divided the
[12:19] light from the darkness and he called
[12:21] the light
[12:22] day and the Darkness he called night cuz
[12:25] see you can't create day and
[12:27] night how do you create day you don't
[12:30] create Day Day is when the light shines
[12:34] night is the absence of I mean night
[12:37] time is an absence of light so you
[12:40] didn't he didn't create day and night it
[12:41] just become that did everybody
[12:43] understand that everybody got it
[12:46] me I can see it in your face it's
[12:50] just I I don't see where what's the
[12:53] problem it's the result the day and
[12:56] night is the result of what he created
[12:58] is that right could you put it that
[13:01] way even Einstein proved that the
[13:05] absence that Darkness was not a
[13:08] creation he proved that Darkness was
[13:10] just the absence of
[13:13] light
[13:15] understand okay but let there be light
[13:18] he said that let there be he didn't say
[13:22] God created light cuz he can't create
[13:24] light he is light right that's not the
[13:27] moon and the stars in the sun he created
[13:29] that in verse
[13:31] 16 that's his self that's his own
[13:34] sustaining he's letting it be known
[13:36] people it's not like it's not like God
[13:39] never was any of these things he always
[13:40] was these things he called it day and
[13:43] night do what in verse five he called
[13:46] the day and night that's what we just
[13:48] read I
[13:50] know he called the light
[13:54] day read the footnote at
[13:57] number read the number four
[14:00] footnote that might
[14:04] help no let's stay right here just hang
[14:07] on a
[14:08] minute that's what I thought the word
[14:11] day is can be used as a solar day or
[14:15] there is a day of atonement and a day of
[14:17] judgment which is not a 24-hour day all
[14:22] right day was when it was light M
[14:26] Darkness was when it was night mhm
[14:29] my Bible ref to Psalms
[14:32] 336
[14:33] and9 and Psalms 336 says by the word of
[14:37] the Lord what the heavens made in all
[14:40] the host of them and by the breath of
[14:43] his and
[14:45] name he and
[14:50] doneand
[14:52] right
[14:56] right but do you see what I'm talking
[14:58] about
[14:59] they God cannot create his own light he
[15:03] was
[15:05] light thank you he was the light of the
[15:08] world now did he shine when he was on
[15:10] the earth I don't believe Jesus was
[15:12] walking down the road at night and he
[15:14] was glowing
[15:16] right come on people we got to get out
[15:18] of our caral
[15:21] thinking but inside him was the very
[15:23] light that I'm just now talking about
[15:25] that's what this light was it was not a
[15:27] created light a created light we're
[15:29] we're looking at the sun and the moon
[15:31] and the stars yes God created that we're
[15:33] going to see that in verse 16 but this
[15:36] light in verse three he did not create
[15:38] he just said let there be and there what
[15:41] I mean it was always there what's God
[15:42] doing God showing that he is
[15:46] light and he called the light day okay
[15:49] so he named
[15:51] it and he called The Darkness
[15:54] night he was just
[15:57] dividing what
[15:59] was now you're looking at it is thinking
[16:02] that that
[16:05] darkness is the night like our night
[16:09] time my
[16:11] Bible has it in capital
[16:18] letters so is that talking about uh
[16:20] daytime and night time no folks it's a
[16:23] revelation it's not what we read that's
[16:27] right it's a revelation
[16:29] day is capital night is capital God is
[16:33] not making the daytime and the night
[16:35] time that we're looking at right
[16:37] now that's why I want to get into this
[16:41] okay that Son of God was the Creator God
[16:44] but he always was light and the Darkness
[16:48] is the
[16:49] devil that capital N I G HT is not when
[16:53] we go to bed at little ni GT remember
[16:56] what daddy always said about capital
[16:58] being in the middle of sentences and
[17:00] that's for God to bring out
[17:03] something he was separating because when
[17:06] did the devil fight with
[17:09] God during the creation
[17:12] nope before the foundation of the world
[17:15] this was already settled but when Moses
[17:18] was writing it he had to show how God
[17:21] was progressively coming closer and
[17:23] closer and closer to you and I right so
[17:27] he said the D capital D a y is the
[17:32] light and the capital n g
[17:35] HT is the other guy cuz there's no
[17:39] darkness in God he's always light I just
[17:43] wanted to read something I found that
[17:46] help help me with what you was talking
[17:48] about it says light not the sun which
[17:51] was created on the fourth exactly thank
[17:52] you but some fixed light mhm which was
[17:56] always there there thank you in some
[17:59] Bibles it will explain that and here it
[18:01] may too but I just didn't have time cuz
[18:03] see it even talks about the day of the
[18:04] Lord the day of the Lord is not a
[18:05] 24-hour period the day of the Lord's
[18:07] been happening since the foundation of
[18:09] the world
[18:10] right but that Capital Dy is God's light
[18:15] that never goes out and that night is
[18:18] the absence of God which is the devil
[18:22] the night the darkness that covers all
[18:25] of us because
[18:26] remember you and I must type this
[18:31] earth right you and I must type this
[18:34] Earth we were without form and void when
[18:36] God created us in the womb of our
[18:38] parents or moms cuz that was God doing
[18:41] it Satan didn't do it right but even the
[18:45] Bible says right here it says and the
[18:48] Earth was without form and born in
[18:49] darkness little day was upon the face of
[18:52] the deep what you and I and our dark
[18:57] sin we were without form and void we
[18:59] didn't know what to do we had no shape
[19:01] sure we look like human beings but what
[19:04] were we we were born in sin shaping
[19:06] iniquities pass from our mother's womb
[19:08] and
[19:09] liar but God is showing here through
[19:12] Moses we got to understand that Moses
[19:13] wrote this and Moses wasn't standing at
[19:16] you know at the foundation of the world
[19:19] Moses was seeing a vision and just like
[19:22] uh sister Trudy said somewhere and even
[19:24] brother Bram said that was not the Sun
[19:26] and the Moon that was created in the
[19:29] fourth day all right we're still in the
[19:31] first
[19:32] day God is
[19:34] showing I am light and in me there's no
[19:38] Darkness at all and whatever is darkness
[19:40] is not of me then he begins to what
[19:43] start to
[19:45] create cuz see right here finish verse 5
[19:48] and God called the light day capital and
[19:51] the Darkness he called night capital and
[19:53] the evening and the for morning was the
[19:55] first capital da
[19:57] ym regular day started evening and
[20:01] morning that's why we proved back when
[20:04] we did the um uh that's why that um the
[20:07] Jews start their day at 6:00 in the
[20:12] evening because the evening and the
[20:14] morning was the first day they start
[20:16] their day at 6:00
[20:17] p.m. and run it till 6:00 a.m. in the
[20:20] morning okay or they run it you know to
[20:23] the next time next 24-hour time up to
[20:26] the next 6: p.m. so that's why because
[20:29] they because they they believe they
[20:31] Creator evening and the morning was the
[20:33] first day all
[20:34] right and God said let there be a
[20:36] firmament in the midst of the water let
[20:38] it divide the water from the waters and
[20:40] see he's already created the Heaven and
[20:42] Earth so this is just coming out of the
[20:44] heaven and coming out of the Earth all
[20:47] right and God made the firmament now he
[20:51] made it and divided the waters which
[20:53] were under the firmament from the waters
[20:54] which were above the firmament and it
[20:57] was so that's the atmosphere and God
[20:59] called the firmament
[21:01] what heaven Capital
[21:04] H and the evening in the morning were
[21:06] the second day all right so
[21:09] now this is the Son of God so let's
[21:11] we're not going to talk about the
[21:12] creation we just kind of you know get
[21:14] that as a foundation all right but who
[21:17] is this guy that's doing it is God
[21:20] Elohim self-existing there's no one
[21:22] there except the angels and the devil
[21:26] and his angels that's all there there's
[21:29] no sons of
[21:31] God as far as you and I standing around
[21:36] God because the prophet told us that we
[21:39] were nothing before the world we were
[21:40] nothing before we were born before we
[21:42] were born we were not anywhere except in
[21:44] the mind of God all
[21:48] right A lot of people don't understand
[21:50] that but let's kind of we're going to
[21:51] spend a little time on this let's break
[21:53] it down a little
[21:55] bit you say how can that happen
[21:59] happen say if I were going to have
[22:01] excuse me honey 10
[22:04] kids if I was God now this is how simple
[22:08] God is if I was God and I was all
[22:12] knowing which God is right he's all
[22:13] knowing he knows everything is going to
[22:15] happen every birth is ever going to
[22:16] happen in the world he knew it before
[22:18] this time we're talking about right here
[22:19] right now if I was all
[22:22] knowing and I knew I was going to have
[22:24] exactly 10 kids where would that be
[22:28] that'd be in my mind
[22:30] right I could name them I could know
[22:34] what they look
[22:35] like so why couldn't God do
[22:38] that God knew ever because his mind
[22:42] listen people we only use about 10% of
[22:44] our brain and some of us don't even use
[22:45] that
[22:47] 10% so there's 90% of our brain that's
[22:50] laying dormant because of sin because of
[22:54] enmity absolutely but if we were all
[22:57] knowing like
[22:58] God you know I think about this is God
[23:01] shows us an example I used to know a
[23:03] person that knew seven
[23:05] languages uh heard of a person that knew
[23:07] 23 different languages well where was
[23:09] that at that was a human person and they
[23:12] knew that where in their brain cuz they
[23:15] didn't come from anywhere else it come
[23:16] from what they stored up in their head
[23:18] and they could sit there and talk you
[23:19] know Japanese and Chinese and Vietnamese
[23:22] and and English and Spanish and French
[23:25] and German they could hear it in one
[23:26] language and speak it another now an
[23:28] America I mean American if any um sinner
[23:32] could do that guess what God can
[23:34] do he's 10 billion times better than
[23:37] that so what we do down here shows a
[23:41] little speck of what God is all together
[23:44] all right same way with children if I
[23:45] knew when I was born and grew up mom had
[23:47] me so I'll have this superhuman
[23:50] perception that I knew I had 10 kids I
[23:52] could go ahead and name them cuz I see
[23:55] them I know they're here once what's in
[23:56] here remember what brother Brown said a
[23:59] thought is nothing until it's expressed
[24:01] but I still have that thought in my head
[24:04] right that thought's right here I can't
[24:06] do away with it this is my thought and
[24:09] if my thought is
[24:11] eternal it's going to have to be
[24:13] expressed cuz I can't keep it up here if
[24:15] it's Eternal now you and I have thoughts
[24:17] of what we're going to do tomorrow what
[24:19] we did yesterday and it's a what they
[24:20] call a fleeting or a passing thought God
[24:23] don't have a passing thought I wished I
[24:26] would have done this I wouldn't know
[24:28] every step of his thought process is
[24:30] eternal and it will come to pass because
[24:33] it's coming to pass right now this is
[24:34] God's mind right here CU it's not
[24:36] something God thought of this is the
[24:39] thoughts of God if it was something he
[24:40] thought of he wouldn't
[24:42] be ever presentent right because it mean
[24:46] he went somewhere and thought about
[24:47] something and then he showed up over
[24:49] here this is the mind of God being
[24:52] played out right now right right now
[24:56] okay and so is this this is to mind this
[24:58] is what God had in his mind and this is
[25:00] what played out in the mind of
[25:02] God and now it's become a reality that's
[25:06] for knowledge that's his forn knowledge
[25:08] he fornew therefore he could
[25:10] predestinate everything that goes on
[25:12] down
[25:14] here but if I knew how many kids I was
[25:16] going to have and I knew that I was
[25:18] going to have every one of them because
[25:19] I was
[25:20] perfect I could go ahead and name them
[25:23] right and what I'm getting to is is that
[25:25] people have a real bad problem with job
[25:27] when he says
[25:28] Where Were You When The Morning Star s
[25:30] together and the sons of God shouted for
[25:33] Joy well we weren't all around the
[25:35] throne praising God in glorified
[25:37] bodies but we were in the mind of God
[25:40] doing the same thing because that's
[25:41] what's going to happen when we get there
[25:44] okay so
[25:45] we we can't bring God together we like
[25:48] to keep him out here like in a journey
[25:50] you know from here to here God's Journey
[25:52] is just like this he's already finished
[25:53] the
[25:54] journey because I'm want to set this
[25:56] basis cuz we're going to talk about when
[25:57] the sons of God shouted for joy and and
[26:00] it's going to be what the mind of God
[26:03] got what God had in his mind he knew we
[26:05] would be shouting about the Plan of
[26:07] Salvation when we got here therefore to
[26:09] him it's just as real job stepped into a
[26:13] reality that's more real than what we
[26:15] are
[26:17] here but I don't want to get we don't
[26:19] want to be confused we want to stay you
[26:22] know let's stay on the
[26:23] line but we do want to bring some of
[26:26] these things out so God created all this
[26:28] Heaven and Earth now on the sixth day
[26:30] what did he do and God said let us make
[26:34] man in our image and after our
[26:38] likeness and let them have dominion over
[26:42] the fish of the Sea and the fou of the
[26:46] air now did God create
[26:50] us I don't think
[26:54] so we were there in
[26:56] him but because brother Brandon said if
[26:58] you have eternal life today you always
[27:01] did have eternal life and eternal life
[27:03] always was eternal that's why they call
[27:05] it eternal
[27:07] life so he said let us make
[27:10] man in other words develop right if you
[27:14] make a cake you're not you really you're
[27:16] not creating a cake you're putting the
[27:19] ingredients together cuz the Cake's in
[27:20] the
[27:21] ingredients God just took all the
[27:23] ingredients and said okay we're going to
[27:25] have man he's going to fall I'm going to
[27:28] come to Earth these people are in me and
[27:30] then one day I'm going to give my life
[27:34] so that I can release
[27:36] them they're going to still be born in
[27:38] sin cuz it can't happen any other
[27:40] way but now I'm putting my cake together
[27:43] let us make
[27:45] man he wasn't talking about every man
[27:47] that walked the face of the Earth you
[27:48] remember that right Genesis 126 is not
[27:50] every man that walked on the face of the
[27:51] Earth Genesis 126 is every Born Again
[27:55] Son of God by New Birth Earth because if
[27:59] you are then you're God made manifest in
[28:01] another form Adolf Hitler was not God
[28:05] back here made manifest because Adolf
[28:07] Hitler did not acquire eternal life all
[28:10] right he said let us make man in our
[28:14] image after our likeness and let them
[28:16] have demean over the fish of the sea and
[28:17] fou of the air cattle and over all the
[28:21] earth now all the
[28:25] Earth Adam remember was an amateur God
[28:28] he was the god of the Earth all the
[28:32] Earth why did God make this Earth for
[28:34] you and I to rule and rain over all
[28:37] right and over every creeping thing that
[28:39] creepeth upon the Earth so God created
[28:42] man in his own image see there he
[28:43] created man now watch in his own
[28:48] image that don't have to be that
[28:51] creation there it's right
[28:53] here right
[28:56] here because this man's going to go into
[28:59] Genesis
[29:00] 3:16 right this man is going into flesh
[29:06] right watch in IM as God created him
[29:10] male and female created he them all
[29:12] right a creation inside of itself
[29:15] because remember those people were not
[29:17] created and you and I weren't in the
[29:19] Garden of Eden right as
[29:21] people but we were in this Mind Of God
[29:24] we were going to come forth all right
[29:28] watch Wait so these are not theop that
[29:31] he created these are not
[29:33] theop so you had a
[29:36] beginning your theophany had a beginning
[29:38] if it did then you're bound for a
[29:40] different
[29:41] place right your
[29:56] theophonic
[29:57] now we know that Sinners have
[29:59] theophanies but not like this one let's
[30:01] talk about this man right
[30:03] here let's go back to the mind again
[30:06] Donnie fush God knew he was coming God
[30:09] knew he'd receive eternal life God knew
[30:12] before the foundation of the world that
[30:14] that would
[30:15] happen so he didn't go ahead and create
[30:17] Donnie faush Donnie faush always was in
[30:19] the mind of God because
[30:22] remember if you weren't in his mind
[30:24] before the foundation of the world
[30:26] you're not going to have eternal life
[30:28] now right that's right well if you're
[30:31] born again you literally are part of God
[30:34] exactly thank you that's what I'm
[30:36] getting to that's great that's fine yes
[30:38] but see that's if that theophany when
[30:40] you're born again you're are you're
[30:42] literally God you're this man that said
[30:44] let there
[30:46] be light or let there be
[30:51] whatever literally if you're not you're
[30:54] a second person that's right
[30:57] that's what we're coming to people we
[30:59] think that
[31:00] we're we think we're over here and God's
[31:03] over here and what's dad been trying to
[31:06] preach that's right he's here if you're
[31:11] here and you're born again he has to be
[31:15] here he can't be anywhere
[31:18] else that's not friend people on the
[31:20] internet say he's only here in L Georgia
[31:22] but if you're born again right if you're
[31:25] born again that's where God is that's
[31:27] not where he was or wants to be that's
[31:29] where he
[31:30] is ever presentent right here we're
[31:33] going to have to
[31:35] stop this might get better than I
[31:39] thought but do you see though how some
[31:42] people look at it and
[31:44] they they get it messed up you can't get
[31:48] Son of God messed up right that's why
[31:51] daddy preached on it for about 8 years
[31:53] remember that picture that was on the
[31:55] wall when I got here in 1998 it was
[31:57] still on that wall and it didn't come
[31:59] down for just a little while you know
[32:02] after I come back but he' been preaching
[32:03] it since' 91 or ' 92 about the Son of
[32:06] God and who the Son of God was CU if you
[32:08] don't get this guy right forget about
[32:10] this man okay all right just pray pray
[32:14] that God will help us all of us may
[32:17] we'll all learn I
[32:20] believe I believe we will
