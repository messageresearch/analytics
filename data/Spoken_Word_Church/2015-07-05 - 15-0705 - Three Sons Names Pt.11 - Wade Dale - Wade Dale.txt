TRANSCRIPT
========================================
number 21 now next Sunday obviously Bob or somebody be taking over tambien hi makeup so just keep me in prayer leaving Wednesday for Jamaica and just keep you in prayers because we're gonna have you doing youth camp never solely done you count before so I'm looking forward to it they'll be blessed yeah they'll be bliss they'll be blessed all right let's go to join and rejoin just where we were thinking before John one let's continue our thought now now we're on we're talking about fork or brother Vernon say we are we are speaking a free son's name brother ground seat bud God comes in three sons name some gods or actually he says some math some gun it son David and not trying to correct the Prophet I'm not but he was the son of God first cuz that's the Creator what brother Brown saying is when Jesus come on earth there was the son of man that's where God came and three sons name alright because he was the son of God in the Old Testament he didn't come to his people he was about remember he was above with right and now in all right Joey was above as the son of god that's the Creator we already spoke on that the theophany the low got the speech all the word right here in the beginning was the logos in the low coffee with god in the logo what guy the same was in the beginning with we've got that's the Sun God right but then he came as son of man because man is where the fall came from right the son of god never felt I think the Sun God's eternal God never had a bad thought that doesn't know anything of sin right that's a creator that's God Himself that's the father that's the father he was made manifest in the form of the Son of God but that's the eternal God ok now the son of man had to be made eternal in the form when he was in flesh because when he came in flesh it was not eternal right no cuz it explains an eternal right all right he had to come this the Sun God had to come in the form of the son of man to come into human flesh because that's where man felt Adam did not fall in its theophany it involved he can't you can't fall that's why that's why the the problem with us is is saying and still telling us even though we got the Creator inside of us enough power in its the Prophet God said to create a world you live on you got that inside you now but the devil's got it so bound because it's not a dent well well we only have it by measure so a measure of God is God eternal is eternal there's not degrees of eternal some people are not gonna live lower than others in eternity right and we're only on the same amount no Sam downtown so that there's no degree now there is degrees here because remember as we were talking about last Sunday jesus said if you say something that gets this form it will be forgiving you Wow because the atonement had not been released from this man to come back on to the believer but now jesus said you speak against the Holy go it'll never be forgiven right and then so the atonement had not been made so so Peter could curse Jesus and not get by with it but there was a remember as we were talking about a couple of seconds ago the Old Testament was right up to the day that Jesus died right right matthew mark luke and john is a commentary of the of what happened in Jesus's life boo but the death of the testator created the new testament jesus said this is the New Testament in my blood it won the New Testament Matthew Mark Luke and John the New Testament was ax1 rights to actually when the Holy Ghost fell on the believers that's when the New Testament when Jesus died there was 30 to 40 days then he ascended ten days later was the bed Pentecost that started what the dispensation of the Sun God again right because remember brother bryan said he died Son of Man some dog can't die that's why I don't never died once heat the eternal life was breathing at him and he became a eternal person with God he couldn't die and even we see the first martyr I was listening brother brownie yesterday the first martyr which was Steven bottle said he fell asleep right so you don't die your fault sleep right you fall asleep because this man can't die the problem with the problem we have is as we let this this part outside man take over the inside man right yes we only let this guy out every once in a while right and that's our problem but you know what it's not a problem God he knew that he knew he knew when he put him in human flesh he would fall yeah but he didn't make him fall he could have lived in human flesh that human flesh could have been matey turn right right collect what's going to happen in our body change we're going to go to the place where adam should have been and Eve had they know they'll fall we're going to be body spirit and soul eternal God right but now as the Son of God if he never failed there's no way there's no atonement that has to be made God had to drop down into the form of the Son of Man drop down into the form of what man us ma'am like said Eva Melchizedek brother Ron said he appears many times in the Old Testament and he did captain of the host Melchizedek pillar fire all those things he came in the Old Testament but there was no form that man could see him and he feared of Moses backside of a man c you guys always been a man so you can't say well this is just the spirit no this is actually this is more real than than this man because we worship in spirit and in truth not inflation in true we worship Him in spirit entry alright so we worship them and what happens with this body if this body does that's what I've said and I told him in philippines and they really laugh about it but you got to think about Paul when they cut his natural head off this theophany was so strong and so eternal he didn't have to pick his head up on this in the safe dimension when he stepped over he'd have to pick any part of him up that axe never killed that part of hills that was inside of it you can shoot him pull them apart cut their hello this guy but that inside man is so strong he's when he stepped over nine other dimension he's more real than he was in this defense right and I said it will be no bullet holes or whatever ever how people but not we give you back cuz what gone set aside a spirit part of him Genesis 1 26 min that to me is more real that's why people would understand that that's the more real part of you than it ever will be this flesh man right because he created that man he Colonel and it's not a creation we understand that we've done our creation it's bringing together and forming so son of God within the Old Testament above the people could not get into people because of the blood of bulls and goats that's your old testament in the Old Testament there was not the death of a man it was a death of an atom right that made the Old Testament under bulls and goats all right but remember that only covered sin didn't do away with it the man that has no sin couldn't get into the men that were sinning by the lame the Old Testament had what we call the new birth and then sure they were saved sure a bruh ham Isaac Jacob they're all going to be there but when Jesus died he died looking back to them and they were looking to Calvary right but there was no end well II there was no bride in the Old Testament never spoken about sure Israel was Jesus's bride but guess what can't put her away right he divorced her but us that's the bride of Jesus Christ it's this man in this man right and then we'll finish let's continue all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made and him was life the life was the light of what men now in verse 14 says what Brenda brown always quote says he doesn't stop up there at the top he always brings it down but what but it's let's read verse 12 he came into his own zone receiving hunter but as many as received him to them he gave power to become the sons of God you had to receive it David to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood this is 126 man was not born of blood it wasn't born of flesh or the will of the flesh we were born because of the will of the flesh the flesh that we have is the permissive will of God to get you here to make your choice I mean that's about as simple as you can make all right and God knowing who he is sure he can have it ready for you when you get here but remember I don't believe you came here with eternal life you can't hear with eternal life you didn't need Jesus to die on crop there's no need of salvation sure there's a predestinated seed but where was it it was in the mind of God he knew who you were he knew who his children were and he knew what David wanted so he put it in the word for you that's why we believe that the seed is the word of God I don't believe it anywhere you'll ever find brother brown sand the seed was anything but the word of God alright which were born not of blood nor the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God jesus said remember he was seated in this scripture here Nicodemus said we gotta come back and getting her mother's womb but he was on my flesh and blood he is he you not be born from where above them you got to be born from above nor the will of man but of God and the logos or the Word was made flesh which made him what lease on a man right and we beheld his glory to glory as the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth right this is John bore witness of me but John can only bear witness of it you and I have that man inside of us the witness right all right good John was still John was born under the Old Testament right John was an Old Testament prophet but the greatest of the prophets why he was the hinge Jesus was the door he was one brought him what Malachi says turn the hearts of the white fathers to the children what the Old Testament father's John was calling me old I'm talking about John the Baptist now not not John the Revelator join the battery was calling the old testament to the new the man that's what he that was his job that was his six-month message was to say there's one coming that's going to take this from the Old Testament and turn it to the new all right and it's going to be a total indwelling of the Holy Ghost not just an anointing all right so V son of mail comes on the earth which is Jesus Christ all right he's the beasts on a man i guess i should have wrote these on man because he is these on a man why is he the son of man because you were born something he was born with this already any that's why I don't believe that we come here with eternal life come if we came here with God already in us at an indwelling and I so we would be the Son of Man right if I get that same man we leave east on a man and we're not the Son of Man we're a subtle man why we come down here as a son of samuel and Peggy Dale right to make our choice to ask this man to dwell in us a man to me that simple when you think about it the people who have the doctor that they came here with that scene quoted sure but we know now that it's we're born by the word seed its plant that's right a baby in utero does not neared the word no see you baby in the womb not even Bowl not even alive brother Brad explain that does he said it's just wiggling muscle that's all we get we get an emotion he said that's what the back I'm in the Pentecostal gut they got an emotion surely lean muscle but there was no life the life comes when the baby is born the light comes when the baby is born again in our case because the first time we were born a little more dead right I just I don't like Paul Paul said one time he said I conclude all understand anyway there's no different and nobody where I conclude that we're all born born in other words my brother man said morning San shapen in iniquity and then the light of the gospel shines on and then that seed that was predestinated before the foundation of the world sure why does it come to life because it's been water ma'am you got to get the watering of the word washing by the one word see because you can take a seat that's got potential life in it you can lay it on that table right there it will never produce but it's a seed and it's got life in it but eventually it's going to knock basically that life is going to go away but if you take that seed and put it in fertile ground put some water on it put it in the right environment because I just conclude one thing for sure brother branham and I got a quote not i'm not going to read it this weekend my reason when i get back brother brown said every person born on the earth was born to be a son gun every person was born to be a son gun even though the mansion no that's pretty much verbatim what everybody he said you have a thirst to serve God now see to me that's that's where everybody's on the same playing field you have a thirst now what you do with that first you can either put it on alcohol or women are a beer I mean a cigarette but there's a thirst in man some wearing you know what the devil do that the devil knew that he knew there was a thirst in man to serve God he just he just took one to serve the guy he wants him to serve him so man makes a choice whether to serve God or Willard to serve the devil there's only two people involved here the only god that's the only two there's no gray area and there's no King priest or bishop in between amen everybody okay same at any man so this son of God came on in april of bc 4 and was born in a manger in flesh the understand what said in april for bc he was born in flesh in bethlehem that man went to flesh you and I and nobody from before or after was born that way a man he's the son of God he's the son of man now we are a Sun God and we are a sauna man right once this enters this that makes you what God in human flesh and the Word was made flesh and and burning Manahan was made flesh if he was a word before back in the attorney that word come down with my flesh but now remember but he was born of blood and a flesh not a will of God at that moment but as you go through life God knew what you needed he knew the very word that would spark you you remember the day of mourning him there was a bear that was a word there was something that haunted you and it was not just the words of the land it was the words of God but he came from the scripture you didn't born that you can get born again reading true love story magazine or watching General Hospital right if you're truly born again you heard from your theophany which was what the word we just proved all that the words of the oppening right but it's not have been having somewhere where did that work laying it didn't land in your neighbors hit land it in flesh right so there than me puts all the clothes together puts all the scriptures together because I conclude all like Paul born in sin and even brother Brown says the oneness with God he says the reason the disciples couldn't understand Jesus is because he wasn't in them yet I've always asked the people that thought this says that we come here with eternal life I said he'd be here come here with eternal life they said yeah said he was standing there with the Word made flesh so when Jesus said receive the Holy Ghost he should have just received it right there did it mean good wine eternally the samples insane don't worry one day you'll just realize how you always was eternal well now there is a time when we really when we realize that if you're truly born again you're going to look back that's why I took a prophet to look back and say hey you were in the mind of God nobody ever taught us if we work up that we come from the mind of God we just read john three sixteen right we were in john three sixteen that if we believe on the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be safe and you know what that straight right that's true many people got saved because of that but now to be a son and daughter fun and to be the bride of Jesus Christ you gotta realize where you come from what you're doing here and where you're going right like what's going about last night you can show what brother rabbit is doing he's going back in the mind of God I said hey this is where you come from what he was doing was and a couple of quotes didn't then I have at home he says it takes the worry away it does when you realize you come from God and that connected with the word and one day that's parked in you and that made you an eternal person was gone to me that takes the worry away sure in our humanity we have worries okay so don't get us wrong with look why worry about nothing well forget that bit we had been if we worry over day but there should be an anchor of the soul they let us know that hey if I did what God said he all already had me a part of me waiting there was a part of my son inside of me naturally waiting to be manifested and abetting ground called marriage so then why would God I've always said yeah I think he quoted it last night but but let's go a little bit further with your daddy is the bottom that's where the seed come from mmm but this but brother I think was all or one of them said who's your mother the bottle says it's New Jerusalem where do you get your nourishment from your mother your daddy can't feed you if you're breastfeeding your father's out a picture right you get nourishment from the mother well this is your mother this is where you get your nourishment right here this is your nourishment your father is God he's the seed word but when you read it that comes your nourishment your nourishment comes out of that I that's why we're being born again that's why we must go up the statute of a perfect man and not just be not just stay spirit babe time we have to be a spirit babe yeah it starts baby but then you work your way up and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory glory and the only begotten of the father now look if we would have all been born here with eternal life god couldn't said that because we would have been begotten that shows me right there the only big only begotten of the Father there's only one man came straight from God to flash remember there's Melchizedek program so we bypass the work we did we come around and it is we did bypass the word because the words right here the word was made flesh come straight from God to flesh we Came what to flesh to go back to God yes that right we came down here in flash now if there had not been a fault what we do we fell through that alright and we had to work our way back up man we fell through it it didn't stop because listen you can't be born with a word in yet you have to receive the word because look we're and we're going to do that in in Jamaica woodland young kids about the Ezekiel talking about a new spirit and then you hired a man and go to justification and I'm going to do the dirty glass and I'm going to actually do the dirty glass I'm gonna take a glass and put it in mud and show them justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost see if I can get him to drink out of that water but remember God won't dwell in that but now for him to reach and get the model he knows there's a pee knows that he's going to be able to use that glass he doesn't pick up they were glass in the field some he knows vessels a lot of diff honor investing with dishonor rights too so he's picking up the one that he knows he's going to clean up and pour a good water in and be able to use that vessel or that glass nobody got that right really simple but but still if we all see where we come from right what we're doing here where we're going to me that's what the seals reveal the seals reveal that we did come from God there was a part of us that was that Genesis 12 six men because you gotta have a place to show I mean everybody even in our family i speaking in the philippines your brother Royals about the masterpiece family you got to know who your family is I mean you got to know where you came from just like we want to look at our ancestry we want to know where we come same thing with God most people were just birth and I don't want to make it seem frivolous are but Martin Luther didn't sit down I don't think he said and the revelation he had was was the just shall live by faith in other words God did it for me I'm going to believe what he said and that's it all right I believe he sat down and read and really went into jess is one and said well that's me I don't believe me I wouldn't believe he probably read revelation score survival was compiled during his time and outboard I don't believe it said to her revelations said well that's meaningless in the third aging church age no he did that but that's who he was yes because he was what recognizing the word but he took a profit like I said many times before it took a profit to get up high enough and what did he do he got up high enough for all of us to get up high with him right right he went brother man went up as an eagle we're still watch chicken right I saw people think well brother Brad went up there in the spheres and he saw he called us the legal ins highly he broke the sound back here oak that barrier to get up there well why did God just do it for one person sure he got up there first sure he was one but what was he doing he was calling everybody else up so you and I can come and we can speak of Genesis 1 and and we can speak of all the things that where we come from what we're doing here program said that's what the sales was that which was which is and we shall come that's the revelation and see to me that takes on with the nervousness the way the nervous part of me is it's all these people that's right around saying well you is eternal and you just realized it I don't believe that I'm adamant about that everybody knows me no no no believe me but they have their clothes well you know what Jesus said eat my flesh and drink my blood yet explained that either so we have to read between the lines see because I know from my experience I was lost I did things that lost people do I didn't do things that God did I didn't want to come to church now why would God BM you mean I won't come true why would God be in me and I go out and you know say bad words and do bad things no but he knew he knew just like a prodigal son like Oh Luise was talking about last Wednesday sure the prodigal son was a son but that son didn't know what he had he didn't know and you know what ninety-nine percent of us if that son were left on his way back we'd be going where you been waving doing why do you do this way need in there that man never said that he believed that Sun was coming back and he didn't wait 30 minutes to restore him he restored him roughing him he'll kill the calf bring the road bring the ring so what's ailing God God sprout always reading us I got nine things in the Bible that God won't ask you one of them is God will never ask you why I took you so long to be safe he'll never ask you that right the prodigal son's father never asked why were you man he never there's no commentary he just welcomed his son home why thought he knew the day that he come back yes he doesn't do that so so the son of god in the Son of Man no I said it won't be here next sunny but the next sunday looks start talking of Jesus as the Son of Man be son of man and what he did on the earth and some of the characteristics that makes us because remember what I said before brother Brian said I'm not the Son of Man now he didn't say I'm a son of God revealing the son of man he said I my son of man revealing the son of man so he had his revelation had come sure we're all sons and daughters of God and we'll never get away from that man but there was a Word made flesh Jesus has got to be back on her like he was the first time because he's the only one remember this don't take a body change it never needed a change it's never changed this needs a body change that's why the son of man had to come back in the end time just for a moment let me give you one more thing before we leave remember Abraham remember Melchizedek right remember the two that went to Sodom I still in June or somebody the other day I said now is the time for the Son of Man yes to be revealed you see while it was before it no listen lot was inside right right the two witnesses which program said was billy graham alone roberts this this gay thing has been started from way back in the forties on business right right building up but never has it been legalized in sodom and gomorrah brother Brown said lot was the governor right he was in a politic well remember what happened the other day five justices voted for the gay rights for voted against right that's right these four if you read some of their commentaries they are absolutely against it there's a lot lot was not in the majority lot became the minority so though he was a judge judging these four judges of the Supreme Court was totally against it they weren't even close hit was for this away and five brought it up for the boat that Justice Kennedy was one who swung to vote so now in Sodom and Gomorrah it had to be let's just let's just say this what it is justjust listen to him in it's never been legal in the United States of America for two people sodomites to marry each other right obviously in Sodom and Gomorrah there must have been some where they came along and voted it in because it was common practice and it was common law that's why they call this Sodom and Gomorrah that's what if you adults you know what Sonny is all right you know why they called him sodomites it must have been legal because remember laught was out of the city then lot goes to the city then the two witnesses go to the city and one brother L say he said they bloody blinded they blinded the eyes what Billy grandma home Robert blinded the eyes of those shot of mine lot was in there which is what I heard first baptist church in gainesville bill coats he said whatever the baptist church says i'll marry him if they say Mary on my home lakewood baptist church brother Tom smiling thank God for a man like him he said I'll never made one elk if you put a gun to my head so thank God for the one just seen as you foolish virgin there's the ones that's the lot people because remember programs did when we're gone see how close I'm telling you how close this is because that was a revealing of the Son of Man to Abraham right but Sodom had to be legal before that can happen and then those said get out brother Brown said we'll work on he said the ones that are left here are going to be hunted down like knowledge and killed from their stand for the gospel it's real close oh you say what another year or two so on it's closed now anything can happen in the United States of America since we have voted this this law in by the High Court they also said that they didn't say how many you can marry so they something that some people see the polygamist are already know they've already took it to the court all right they're saying if you let them you go with us and for men can marry each other now it don't have to be a couple right so a polygamous for coming in and saying hey what about a human you at least I was is somewhat natural but we can produce children we can you know we can do the things like that but but this is sort of my condition now we live now sure we've been living in it but I'm sure there's a time come with a lot because the Bible said it bangs his righteous soul there was a day come when they voted that in and saw them and go on and it really hurt lots feelings it really hurt like same email it's exactly what is happening for both in my heart oh I'm sure they will the forum voted against it you know they're not going to be very popular at all you know so we gotta go we gotta get freaking cool breeze Thank last not knowing where they're talking about in this wide open they've opened the floodgate
