middle of the week we'll just go right to the scripture Hebrews chap 10 verse 19-22 and uh just take a little topic little Wednesday night topic of how how do I overcome let's just go the Lord in prayer Lord God we're so grateful for this for the words of eternal life that you've given unto us in this age that takes tears down all the confusion and all the chaos and gives us Clarity on what we're doing here and what we need to do to go forward I pray God that you'll Lord be among us tonight Lord Jesus we've come Lord Jesus together to hear your word and to be strengthened Lord Jesus I pray God that you'll give us exactly what we have need of Lord be with my lips Lord Jesus to anoint me to say Lord what's written in your word with the right meaning the right effect Lord God and I pray that you'll be with your people to Quicken the words to them Lord Jesus we ask your bless blessing now in your name amen so Hebrews 10: 19 starts off like this Paul's telling us having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus by New and Living Way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having an high priest over the house of God let us draw near with a true heart and full Assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water God bless you you may take your seats of course we we know we we went through these scriptures in Sunday school and and uh it's it's kind of good to go back and rehearse some of the things that we read but you think about how that uh there's a New and Living Way Paul is telling us which he ha consecrated us through the veil of Christ flesh back behind the veil you know and that's modeling the Old Testament uh outer Court inner Court holy of holies model that way that you go from the outer Court to the inner Court to the holy of holies where you have that innermost fellowship with God and you think about behind the veil of Christ's flesh dwelt that same logos that same Pillar of Fire that led the children of Israel through the Wilderness that was that met Paul uh Moses there in the in the burning bush that spoke to all the different ones in different ways and different times and different seasons and now that same life was back behind the veil of Christ's flesh and that now you and I can have fellowship with that same life if we'll go through that process that was typed of outer Court inner Court holy of holies that's why Paul is saying let us draw near with a True Heart in full Assurance of Faith having our heart sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water you think what a great promise that is that God can take somebody that doesn't have you know we've been kind of meditating on conscience that's got an evil conscience and he can sprinkle that conscience through with his blood and with his word and and change that so that your conscience is clear and your body can be washed with pure B water and clean you up so that you can walk and live in a Sanctified life so you know brother Brandon would ask that question why are people so tossed about why does it seem like people are so tossed about from this ever which way and you know you see people that'll they'll come to church for a little while and then they go out and they they they just can't uh live a stable Christian life and that's what we're meditating on this evening what what does it take for me to overcome and there's so many things that I can overc for us to overcome in this day that seems like the the do of Hell have just been leased in this age the internet the worldwide web is snatching people away and and uh things at at at at schools and everywhere you go at work it's enemies on every hand well how do I overcome those things and now even in you know you maybe you might just be sitting in your room with a video game and you might have all these mind battles and things well how do you how do you overcome there might not even be anybody sitting in the room with you just you and yourself and the devil giving you all these thoughts given all this torment well how how do I overcome well I thank God that God has given us the recipe for these things laying here in this scripture and if we can just get away from all the social media and get away from all the world worldly things and all the movies and things and look into the recipe of God's word we'll find out how to defeat the Devil at every turn now isn't that right that God whenever You' got a problem in life if you want to make a cake you go look at the recipe if you want to if you want to Pro figure out how you need to file your taxes go look at the documentation if you want to find out how to do anything in life there's a rule book and an instruction book and God has given us his rule book and if we'll follow it we'll we'll have overcoming power in our life and you you you think about what brother Ram said in in this sermon that we're just meditating on tonight he said I believe we're living in a very I think this was many many years ago I I believe we're living in a very wonderful glorious day of opportunity when people of this day living to see the Shadows of the coming of the Son of God oh if it was the Shadows back then what about now what what kind of a day should we we be living in now he said I believe with all my heart that the world is going to burst now into the greatest Revival that was ever known or it's going into the darkest chaos that's ever been known in history it's a great time of people to make a decision on what they're going to do now this was back way many many years ago where it it seemed like the whole nation was sitting at like a junction time and based on people's decision they were going to either go off down into chaos into the darkest chaos that's ever been known in history or burst now into the greatest Revival that was ever known now you think about the nation sitting in a junction time like that well what about what about you and I sitting whatever your your status and life is sitting here tonight it could be your Junction time where whatever way you turn that's the way you could either go to a great Revival and you know we know the days of Revival the the Revival Days Are Over the days where just worldwide everybody's jumping and shouting and great big worldwide Revival like they had overseas in John Wesley's days and isza Street and so forth those days are over oh but now when you when you make the right decision and you yield yourself to God and and take him at his word oh then the great there's a greatest Revival that's ever known that will start in your heart and in your life now that's what we're talking about tonight not not just kind of a head religion not just kind of an intellectual something but something that really takes place down in your soul something that takes place in your heart where you don't make a decision from your head but down on the inside that you make a decision where uh you you want to serve God and and and you make a decision to follow after him no matter what comes no matter what comes your way whether it's heartache whether it's trials where whether it's difficulties you've set your mind on things above and you're going to stay with it no matter what now that's when something really begins to take place I was looking at the hour the message the hour has come or brother brother said the time has come the time has come when the sign should follow the Believers the time has come for the church to move up or go back you have to make your decision isn't that right the time has come and maybe tonight if you haven't decided to make your decision yet maybe the time has come for you to do so maybe the time has come for you to figure out what you're going to do and what direction you're going to go in or whether you're going to give your heart to God or not the time has come and I I I think to meditate on what he's saying there the time has come when sign should follow the Believers if we're ready really meditate on those words that he's saying that to to really take hold of it that that I want to see God moving in my life that I want to see something taking place in my life and you know brother Ram said that many times spiritual Le people some because the sons of God are going to be led by the spirit of God they're going to be something Supernatural is taking place in their life and he said many times spiritual Le people are going to be misunderstood because it's such a strange and an odd life to live a full surrendered life to the Lord Jesus Oh somebody somebody that's overcome it's strange to see somebody that's overcome somebody that's overcome the things of this world and don't want nothing to do with the world it's strange we we were talking about on the way in you know the the girls had interviewed a little job and and they they uh they they they told them they were going to be hired and they sent them all the paperwork and everything well they they told they sent them the the thing that said you got to you we want to know what your pant size is well they messaged them back and say well we don't wear pants and crickets I ain't heard nothing back for like three or four days why cuz it's odd it's different you're different it just it's beyond finding out like that the world just don't know what to do with you if you're if you're if you've overcome the things of this world you're going to act different you're going to dress different and I don't think that's anything to be ashamed of oh when you find yourself being ashamed of the Gospel or ashamed of your mom or your daddy or ashamed of the way that your parents or your grandparents dress or ashamed the way your church is or it's time to time to go past that Veil past the past the inner Veil to go into that Holy place and find out that there is really a living God that'll change you and make you act differently and dress differently and talk differently what does somebody what does a spiritual Leed person look like that the world finds odd and strange they're going to act different aren't they they're going to dress differently they're going to act differently they're going to be living by their conscience living and guided by a conscience that keeps them from doing things at work that other people don't have no problem doing things you keeps you from doing things maybe even at church that other people don't have any problem doing it's going to make you live a life where you can have love and compassion for other people oh that's the kind of life that I want a life where you can love somebody that hates you and have compassion for somebody that nobody else can have compassion for you oh I'm talking about a Christian Life where you can have fellowship with other people and you want to live in unity not division but you want to come together in fellowship and Community where you can you want to live in peace and forgiveness oh that's what a real Christian holy ghost filled life that's what an overcoming life is where you live in peace peace and forgiveness and you're trying to bring peace instead of division you're trying to forgive instead of Harbor up all these uh Ledger books of things that people have done to you over the years years but you're trying to forgive you're trying to you're trying to cover things over because all of your sins were covered over by what Christ did for you on calvary or a real overcoming life is going to have faith and trust in God because your life is going to be lived by faith your whole life is based on faith so when when there's it looks like there's nothing to have faith in when the doctor tells you there's there's just no hope when it looks like all hope is gone but yet there's something down on the inside of a real believing Christian that hangs on because your life is based on faith and you know a Believer a Believer is always going to believe that's what they known by because they trust they trust in God and no matter what comes no matter what the situation is they're still going to trust and believe in God right amen and that's why the mark of a real believer is going to be truth and faith and integrity and honesty that's a real Hallmark of a real Christian as living their you know what Integrity is as behaving the same way in public and private is behaving the same way all the time and living your life based on a set of rules that come straight out of the word of God that that make boundaries for your life and restrictions and rules and constraints that make you live a life of honesty and integrity and God wants us to live a life of honesty and brother Ram said there's one thing that a person must always be and that is honest tell things so that you can go back and tell it a million times and it'll be be the same thing now that's how you want to live a peaceful life I remember growing up when I was a teenager you know you'd say something you'd try to get out of something you know and and then now you got to connect all the dots well I said this and now so I got to I got to say it this way next time but but if you just if you're just honest all the time that you don't have to remember what you said last time you don't remember have to remember what you said yesterday and then the week before that and a month before that to make sure the whole story lines up all you got to do is just be honest and tell it the way it is tell things so that you can go back and tell it a million times and it'll be the same thing you see so just be honest no matter if it's bad or whether it's good be honest and if it's against you say it anyhow or keep still don't say it at all see no no matter what it is brother Brandon would say if a man is not as good as his word you can't trust him because he's not no good now where's that come from it come from God now we're come from God so we're going to act like our daddy and our daddy when he says something you know you can trust that in fact he gave us two immutable evidences two things two that God the god that can't lie swore an oath on top of that so we we could TR we know we can trust God now if we come from God then that makes us honest just like our daddy so if we say something then we're going to stick with it we're going to stay with the word you you can you can uh you can trust on a real Christian's word just like you can trust in the word of your daddy now now if you really realize that you if you really look at the word of God like that when God promises something you can trust it when your daddy says something you can trust it and if you're like your daddy you can trust your word too now he said just be honest no matter if it's bad or whether it's good be honest I I think sometimes we have trouble with that even in our own life you know some sometimes you struggle the man well I don't want to tell my wife if I don't like her food but now come come on now you can layer some love on top of it and say I would I would rather not eat this kind of food and then you'll be happier for it cuz if you don't like it then why you why should you have to eat it come on now I'm talking some truth hon honesty Honesty will make your life happy if you say I don't like macaroni and cheese then why should you have to eat macaroni and cheese if you don't like it just be honest and be frank and be real if you come on now let's get home now if you don't like the preaching be H just be honest sometimes I I wish I W you know sometimes my wife will tell me you went too fast you went too slow or whatever or I didn't understand and you know what it helps to be honest not she's trying to not she's not trying to control my preaching or nothing like that but you know some if you're if you're upset with somebody just be honest with them just be frank with them because you know it helps it helps to be honest now I'm not talking about being mean and hateful and everything and and and telling your wife you wish you'd lose a lot of weight and all that kind of stuff but you lay her some love on top of it put some love and be real mix it together and then you'll have something you'll have a recipe that'll get you somewhere if you can't understand if you can't understand be honest you know you come to church sometimes and you just can't understand the preaching you might as well be honest with yourself be honest with yourself and be honest with the preacher be honest with the teacher and say I wish that you would frame a little bit different and just be honest and that'll help everybody it'll help you it'll help the preacher to be honest and if you're struggling to overcome just be honest if you're struggling to overcome you might as well be honest with yourself and say I got a problem with this thing that I'm trying to overcome and if you're not convinced be honest if you have a question you might as well be honest and you know what God will bless an honest heart God will bless you in your home God will bless you in your marriage if you're honest if you're honest with your kids he'll Bless you that's the problem we've got sometimes we draw back from just being being honest with our kids well I don't think you should take communion how about that as honesty I don't think you're at a place where you really are dedicated enough and really sincere enough and let's have an honest conversation and just lay it out there but we draw back from being honest we'll say well I I I don't want to hurt their feelings I don't want and that's our problem isn't it when when somebody's honest with you and you draw back because you don't want your feelings hurt then it it it that that that's the problem that we all have to we all have God will bless an honest heart we must be honest in heart now now look what honesty is honesty is based on truth and our daddy is honest and when he says something you can Bank on it amen and the whole chist whole of Christianity is based on honesty and truth so much that if you want to see a devil cast out be honest that's how you cast out Devils is be honest be honest and real don't cloak it over with no deceit don't try to cover it over with some some deception or some manipulation but just be real honest be real honest and true now there's a TR there's a secret if you want to see a devil leave you come up for prayer and you just lay it all out there and you say I'm coming with an honest heart and I want to be delivered of this thing I want to be delivered of the thing that I'm trying to get rid of I'm trying to overcome and you come and lay it all out there at God's feet and say God you take care of and I'm coming with an honest heart I'm coming believing I'm coming believing what you said because I know you're a God that keeps his promises and you see if God doesn't come and keep his word and give you something that you can that will anchor your soul that you can overcome with Honesty will cast out Devils right Honesty will cast out Devils Amen in John 8:32 it says and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free why it's honest communication it's something coming over the pulpit that really will that that you know is true and you recognize it's true it's not fake it's not false but it's the truth and the truth an honest truth is what will set you free of the devil's captivity and you'll watch those chains drop off your life and and you'll begin to have real and real overcoming experience like what was spoken of in John 17:17 where Jesus said sanctify them through through thy truth Thy word is truth now if the word is truth and the word received in a penitent heart that desires to be truthful will actually cleanse you and sanctify you how by getting rid of the Devils getting rid of the devils in your life getting rid of everything that plagues and besets you it the truth the honest truth is the thing that set you free and John 17:19 Jesus said and for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth how you going to be Sanctified through the truth not a lie we're not coming to church to hear some deceiving words or some kind of manipulation or something but we're here to hear the transparent freely given freely available truth the honest truth not mixed with any kind of a lie but the honest truth and honesty listen now Honesty will take care of any kind of a devil that's in your life Honesty will take care of infidelity somebody's cheating on somebody else maybe a young person got caught up in something at school or whatever and they're cheating on their boyfriend or girlfriend but you you bring it back home and just lay it out there in honesty I'm sorry I did something wrong now you might not get the the result that you want but at least you'll be honest and you'll be free in your conscience your conscience will be free now that's what we want so sometimes we avoid being honest because we we we don't we we're afraid we're not going to get the desire that we want to see but the desire that I think every Christian wants to see is a pure conscience a pure heart where your conscience is clean and honesty will take care of prejudice where where you don't want to talk to somebody else because they're different than you or because they're richer or poor or whatever but oh you just let a real honest CH you know you know brother I I I I've been looking across the parking lot at you and I hadn't really got to know you before but I'd like to take you out to eat sometime or something and you just have a real honest conversation and watch that devil of Prejudice leave you and you'll be different that devil of corruption somebody at work trying to to do something uh uh uh behind behind somebody's back or whatever go around go around corners and everything but just real Honesty will take care of that Honesty will take care of a cheater at school just looking over at their friend's desk honesty and you know that's what God wants us to be is he wants us to be honest in our schoolwork if you if you'll really buckle down and do your schoolwork and try your very best and not try to cheat not but but to really do it do your very best then that's something that you can be proud of how can you be proud if you looking on your friend's paper and you're copying everything and and trying to trying to get credit for what they've done and then at the end of the school year you look back and you haven't learned nothing you haven't done nothing because you're just kind of riding somebody's coattails and that's how a lot of Christians are too they don't want to learn anything they just want to ride a preacher's coattails they don't have an experience for their yourself they just want somebody else to tell them what they should believe and tell them how they should act and hang on to somebody's coattails but God wants honest communication he wants honesty honesty from the beginning to the end and honesty will take care of your mental health that's that's why so many times we got to pop pills and things because because we just ain't living an honest life we we're harboring all this resentment and all this things against everybody else and then we got to go to the doctor and i' I've I've sat there at work and listen to people tell ask questions about the health care and and they'll raise their hands and they'll say well I'm taking $400 on for drugs a month on and things like that and and and then you find out Christians are having to do the same thing because they got such horrible mental health problems and I'm not saying nothing against doctors or any kind of those kind of things you know you got to do what you got to do but God God gave us a way to be free of these things so that you can have Clarity in your mind and you're not you're not bound by the by the devil putting all this weight of the all these things in your mind that you're trying to battle out and I I'll tell you if you just be honest with be honest with your wife be honest with your children be honest with the preachers at church be honest with everybody at church and you'll find out that the devil will leave be honest it's the truth it's the truth that is taking us to a higher plane of Revelation and understanding now it isn't that isn't that the case that that's what we come for is the truth and the truth that we hear is piling on piling on until in our hearts and in our minds until we're changing to be true to be perfect that's what Perfection is complete until we're true like our father is and brother Ram said he said he told this story as he was preaching this sermon he said I went home tired weary upset crying went to bed and after the wife got to sleep I went in the room and knelt down and said dear Jesus I don't know what I'm going to do here I am right back where I started from again I guess I made a failure about two hours from then he appeared to me see how sometimes you got you got to pray for a while don't give up he started praying and he said two hours later he appeared and he showed me a vision of such a panoramic view of people I never seen I was talking to my wife in The Vision now think about I I I really like to just meditate on these things these stories that he's telling sometimes we just we'll listen have a tape playing in the in the background and we're not really paying attention but let's let's meditate on this so he's seeing a vision of a panoramic view of people and he said now you people that I know that know me I I know I'm not a fanatic I don't say these things unless they're the truth I thank God for a prophet that would not just be uh flippant with saying something but he'd wait till God he was sure God showed it to him and then he made sure that he was telling people the truth oh thank God that we can read a message like that with confidence that it's the truth and this thing the story that I'm telling you is the truth that's right and I seen it then I seen brother arganbright standing there and I went up to him and he said Billy brother Billy we've given out all the prayer cards and everything's ready now for the meeting we got a way to take you in and out I said thank you brother arganbright and I walked over to some more Brethren and they was another brother preaching I said who's he they said they put him up I said who who is they he he's turning around there's there's somebody else preaching how hey what's going on and they just turned around walked away and the man made dismissed the audience and let them all go I said oh you shouldn't do that because there's no altar call oh they said another fellow spoke up and said we we done took up the offering I said when is the offering more important than Souls before Christ see now in this Vision they were prioritizing money something else over Souls oh that's the main thing of any church service that's when you come together sometimes we lose focus of the thing that we're coming to church to kind of see one another we're coming to church to to eat at lunch and and have some fellowship and whatnot but the main focus of this whole thing is souls and that's what brother brandom got all upset about is is what what about the alter call who was that everything was off kilter and this man was up there speaking and they dismi he dismissed the service and he said and and another fellow spoke up and said we we done took up the offering like that was the main thing and and my friends money ain't the main thing that ain't Why We Gather and there ain't any other main thing other than Souls that is the only reason that is the main reason all the other things around that the songs that we sing and the fellowship and the the cushy pews that we sit on and everything everything is just accessory to that fact that we're here for Souls that's what we're here to do is win souls so brother brandom was no was so upset there was no altar call and oh think that tonight how much value how much value did that man Place upon Souls we're just going to we're just going to dismiss the congregation we got the offering that's what that's what the service meant to him but there ain't how much value do you place on a soul how much value do we place on a soul to think that your soul is worth 10,000 worlds and so then God took him and showed him a vision efficient for Souls efficient for souls he taken me up to a real bright stream of water it was the most beautiful blue water and great fish were swimming around in it he said I will make you a Fisher and he said Now cast your lure into the water and when you do pull it slow first time and the next time just give it a little jerk not too hard and the next time set your hook for the catch and so there's three PS go go got it and he said I got it all excited and jerked it hard on the next one out and I pulled the fish and all out of the water and what it was it was a little bitty fish and it just about the size of the lure and I got my mind all tangled up and I was straightening out my line and the man was behind me this man which was behind me walked around in front of me dressed how in Palestinian cloes with a turban on his head he had a turban on his head I I know y'all heard this story before but maybe you hadn't which is why I'm reading it like this he had a white robe he said brother Brandon that's it I said I know I didn't do it right I said I jerked it when I ought not to and he said don't get your line tangled up in these kinds of times I said well I'm running as straight as I can I'll be very careful the angel told him you was always trying to explain it you oughtn't to have done that he said you made a public showing out of it now let's examine the night where brother Brandon messed up in that Vision sometimes the Supernatural is be Beyond explanation and the fishing line got all tangled up when he tried to explain it he tried to make it public and you'll see as we go along studying this thing out the third pool is private it's something that happens to you as an individual you know many times in your Supernatural life things will happen God will do something for you private that you can't share but it's expressed in different ways anybody can look at somebody and see see that something's happened to them in a private realm so something happened privately to a Christian and they got a private New Birth a private experience and then they come to church and you can see that something's changed something happened privately something happened down on the inside something happened to you in that little room in John 3:3 Jesus answered and said unto them verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God so something happens to you privately where you can see the kingdom of God but then you can't explain to somebody else what you see you can try to explain but they can't see unless they're born again you don't know what's in that holy of holies you don't really know unless you're born again the only way that you can really see is you've got to be born again and I'll give you an example they probed and argued at at Matthew 28:19 that Jesus said that you got to be baptized in the name of the father Father Son and Holy Ghost and Peter come down on the day of Pentecost because he could see he he was saying like brother Donaldo was preaching he was saying the same thing that Jesus said but if you're not born again you can't see that you can't see it the right way when you're born again your eyes become open now you see what the evidence of the new birth is that you can see your ey your spiritual eyes become open and that's why in 2 Corinthians it says therefore if any man being Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new and Revelation chapter 3:20 says behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will suck with him and he with me now there's God knocking at your door and if you open up the door then he'll come in and the door shut behind you and it's you and God in there eating over the table it's you and God in there alone private something happened I I thank God that the gospel is set up that way that even here while I'm speaking to you you in amongst all of this group here together that something can H be happening privately with different individuals that's why I I love some sometimes you you know you go preach and and it some seems like everybody's draw draws back but other times you preach and it seems like you're just preaching to a congregation where tears are rolling down people's faces and what is it it's they're sitting there in public amongst everybody else but something private is happening something H is happening that that maybe the person next to you don't have nothing no idea what's going on that's why brother R said then he taken me from there and I seen a great huge tent I never seen such a tent and it was packed and lined everywhere with people looked like I was standing above the people looking down where I just made an altar call and hundreds and hundreds of people were weeping and rejoicing after they had accepted the Lord Jesus as their Savior and I looked and then heard a man get up and say call the prayer line I think that's two very striking things about this third pool Vision that it was well it was packed with people and there was something there to attract them they weren there to see some television show but they were there to see something truthful something real and and there was these two things that seems like everybody in the message always battles about here in this third pool Vision there was an altar call and there was a prayer line now I you know brother BR said an alter call sometimes you man gets to pulling at people and saying well don't you aren't you afraid of your mama's going to die or whatever but when God really begins to draw now there's a real alter call that God's doing the drawing amen and he said people begin to line up over on this side the left from where I was looking down the platform and they lined all the way up and down the street for a prayer line and I noticed to my left which would have been to my right if I was on the platform a little wooden building and I seen that light that all they have the picture of you know that's always in the meetings I seen that light leave me and go to that building and go in that building and a voice said to me I'll meet you in there that'll be the third pool and I said why he said well it won't be a public show like the other and he said I'm just going to kind of skip through my notes he said I don't understand going into that closet like that that little think now in that big huge tent that little wooden wooden room right there in the middle of it and brother R said I don't understand going into that closet like that and then and and the angel told him he referred to Matthew chapter 6 that says doesn't the scripture say when thou prayest Thou shalt not be as the Hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men verily I say unto you they have their reward but thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou Hast shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly and brother random will refer to that little building as a closet to tie it with this scripture in Matthew chapter 6 when thou prayest enter into thy closet because something's going to happen to you in your private Closet in your private chamber where just you and God alone and he would say I just believe that little old Tabernacle is going to spread out and it's just going to be marvelous what the Lord will do oh sometimes when it's when you get alone that's when you really find something that you can anchor to when you get along with God and you begin to maybe maybe shut the door and just begin to think about God's word and his promises that's when you something really anchors down in your heart and the things maybe that you've heard through the week or that on that tape you've been listening to it begins to be real to you then you've got a real anchor you you know sometimes you go to work and it seems like people say hurtful things and at church or whatever and you just s so tossed about by everything but when you get into your little private time with God that's when things begin to get different maybe you've got something against your brother maybe you got something against somebody or you don't even know which direction to turn what what should I where where should I go to school where should I go to church but you get along with God and you begin to meditate on his word and you begin to talk to him and he talks back and something real begins to take place now come on church that's where we really begin to get anchored when we're alone with God so alone with God God we where you're not hindered by all the other things of this life all the other things of the world you're not hindered by some some nonsense that somebody told you well I don't think you'll ever receive it I don't think you'll ever get healed but you get along with God and find out what God says about it and then you'll find out that you're not tossed about a Christian is not tossed about why because a Christian's faith has got a solid resting place you know we paint the picture in our mind so many times of like a a boat on the sea that's tossed around about but uh brother Ram said he was in a plane one time and he was looking down at a boat in the harbor and he was wondering how that boat could be why it wouldn't move out of its place in the middle of the storm that he was looking at and the guy next to him said well is anchored it's anchored it's it's it's not it's not moving around because it's got an anchor and every Christian's anchored to the word of God the truth that they have heard the truth that they believe and that is their anchor I think God tonight that my faith don't have any don't doesn't rest in any ability that I would have it doesn't rest in any ability that anybody has or upon what church I belong to or what people I associate with but my faith anchors and rest entirely upon the finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ already been received and that's why so many people kind of get tossed around about cuz they don't have that anchor right he said I've noticed many Christians is in my life to be up and down I've wondered about that now if you're like that tonight if you're if you're tossed about and and you want to you want to have a real stable relationship with God like your parents do or like the the other believers at church do maybe that's a question to ask why am I tossed about he said there are people who seem to be very religious seems to have such a deep desire and daily they search and hunt and seek for God and never come to any settlement of any kind to where they could ever be settled or anchored into Christ now I'm just kind of going to take a quick detour here I think years ago when brother rown was preaching sermons like this that was the case that people were searching and hunting and seeking and trying to get but they just couldn't get stable and that's what he's preaching at I think now the danger is that people just don't really care anymore I I I had a young man that asked me a question uh when I was preaching at a church he said what do you think the the most dangerous thing that young people face today is and I I told him I think it's apathy I think that's the most dangerous thing that anybody faces is they just just don't really care anymore they they come and they sit and they look and and they're and they're there but what is what is the point that brother R's getting that the heart the heart is not in it if your heart's not in it you know you can memorize scriptures and you can look at things from your mind from your intellectual standpoint and and learn and and learn all the Greek words and all the different meanings and things but if your heart's not in it something's wrong you're not stable that's why he would say there's two different kinds of christianities an intellectual or a mental conception of what God has said in his word and an experience that God has given the man in his heart do y do y'all know what that means to have an experience an intellectual conception where you can read about it and you see or you you listen to what somebody else has said but an experience is where you've been there yourself am is where you have lived through it yourself when you can look back at the scripture and say I I was there I was there when when Jacob was wrestling with the angel I know what that's like I was there when Ruth come from the moabites and she heard a message and she turned and she said I'm I'm going to go with I'm your God is going to be my God and your people's going to be my people I was I was there when David was pulled from the Sheep coat I was there when Moses made God at the burning bush and then you can know because you've had your own experience and you've Liv through it now see he said the one intellectually intellectually is a hungering with your brain with your brain you're just and your spirit you're just thinking about it and you you want something you you want it and he's feasting on God even but his his Feast doesn't hold out you know that's like somebody that had a good Evangelistic camp meeting and and they hear the word of God they're feasting on it they enjoy it and they maybe they'll run and Shout a little bit but then they leave and something hadn't anchored because it's just in their spirit in their head it's just in their brain but the other one the other that's got an experience something happened in their soul the other one seems to have Victory all the time there ain't nothing bothers them now now come on frame it right what he's saying there's plenty of things in life that bother you I I think sometimes being a uh being a Christian you know can be maybe one of sometimes the most sad experience the most full of the most heartaches full of the most trouble but yet there's nothing that bothers you nothing that bothers you you might not H be happy you may maybe all your happiness is taken away but there's nothing that bothers you because down in your heart you've got joy joy unspeakable and it was it will anchor you and carry you through all the all the ash heaps that job set on where maybe tonight you can look back and say I know what it's like to sit on an ash sheep cuz you've experienced it and you've been through it and you can be identified with that but you're just as solid and anchored as can be because you've got an anchor in your soul that holds and no trials and no storms bothers you at all and brother man would say that they seem to have something about them that people who are Christians and trying to live for God admire that type of Christian look how he framed that people who are Christians admire that type of Christians you know there's there's a lot of people that are Christians they're they're they're in the campground they they're in the in the court and they come and they're they're they're you know they're participating but they're just you know they they look like their life is a little bit shaky but then then there's other people that oh oh they're salty and and you it just makes you thirsty to look at their life and that's the kind of a life that we should strive to have the kind of a life that makes other people salty to make our kids want to be like that to make our our young people want to be like that that's why Jesus said in Matthew Matthew Chapter 5 ye are the salt of the earth but if the salt have lost its savor wherewith it shall be salted don't you want to be that kind of a Christian that's a salty Christian is somebody that shows love and kindness and respect to all people a a salty Christian makes Faith a priority a salty Christian gives freely of your time and your talents a salty Christian is hungering and thirsting for righteousness constantly oh you just want more of God and if you don't get nothing else out of this sermon maybe tonight just think I think about how much more of God you want if you want more of God there's more that be had to think how much more you want of God to hunger and thirst after righteousness and that's one of the on that Sermon on the Mount Jesus said if you hunger and thirst you're going to be filled you're going to get what you're hungering for what a blessing it is just to want it because there's so many in this life that could care less oh I I think that's one of the greatest curses there is to sit in a meeting to sit in a church where the truth is being preached and to not care that is that is truly a curse that is a curse upon this generation that's a curse upon this upon this age that we're living in where the gospel can be preached and people just turn a blind eye and not care fruit salt is showing compassion for the poor and putting other people's kns before your own and being a positive example to others and brother brand would say I've often wondered Lord what is it that these people have that others crave so much for and yet seem to fail to get it and he said many of our teachers in schools have brought in much the ology of telling the people well it's CA you didn't shout or CA you didn't speak in tongues or all these things but he said altogether you find these people when they do shout or speak with tongues or some other emotion they still don't seem to be the person that they should be so it's not how much you shout is it but let's not get rid of the shouting it's not how much emotion is it you can have aemotion or not have Emo motion and that won't prove what it is but let's don't get rid of the worship oh thank God for balance I don't want get I don't want to get rid of the worship just because it's not emotion I don't want to get rid of the shouting just because that's not how much you shout but it's something that takes place in your soul something that takes place in your heart and he said you truly have two different mental faculties you've got the one of them in your brain and the other is operated in your heart which is called your soul so it's your spirit and your soul I think think now what are you using right now what is it listen to this sermon I I preached sermons before where the pastor would come up behind me I preached this sermon one time uh just recently with the pastor come up behind me and he said well that was a sermon for your soul what does he mean by that sometimes you know you just get there's sermons preached that just kind of get you all excited right but then there's other times where a sermon really gives you something that'll anchor you and it's not just to get you worked up but it's to give you something that'll help you in your soul not just in your flesh or your spirit that's why Paul said bodily exercise profits a little it's great to get up and run around at church sometimes but something that'll anchor you and keep you is that correct teaching of the word the truth of the Gospel that will that will give you power against the devil overcoming power that when the Devil comes and tells tells you you ain't worth nothing you got something to throw back in his face when the Devil comes with all of his lies and schemes you've got the word of God to give it right back to him and just like Jesus did when he was tempted because that's how you'll defeat the Devil every time that's how you'll cast out Devils that's how you'll change the atmosphere of your home that's how the atmosphere in the church changes do you do you real if you think about that words have such a power that by the when the truth is presented it will actually change the atmosphere in the place that it's in isn't that true when you're sitting around at supper time and you begin to talk about Jesus then the atmosphere changes because the words that you speak have an effect and brother Adam said there's been things that's happened to you that you knew was going to be yet you could not explain why what are you using right now what's the difference between your soul and your spirit sometimes something happens down in your soul and your spirit's at odds with it and you wrestle with it you battle it out like Jacob and the angel and he'd say there's no reason you couldn't explain it out but yet you just accepted it and it happened just that way that's when something happens down here something down here when the doctor says I I don't think there's any hope but if there's something happened down there way down deep like an iceberg with way down under the water there's that part part that you can't see or like a ship that way down under the water there's that Rudder that's that's guiding the motion of the ship and you can't see it you can see what's happening on the deck of the ship but there's something happening underneath that controls where it goes and that's what your soul is your soul controls where you go what's going on under the water what's controlling your direction now you see the difference between and I'm not going to stay too late tonight it's already been 45 minutes so I'm going to be closing just directly I'm not going to keep you long but let's let's meditate on this before we close what's the difference between your heart and your head your heart is going to be an experience I know cuz I've experienced it firsthand but your head is going to focus on all doctrinal Precision a accurate understanding let's make sure we articulate it right now now see what you can focus so much on correct articulation just like the Pharisees were trying to prove out or or maybe the early Christians that didn't understand the people of that day trying to understand what Jesus said about how you should be baptized now he said I got a quote I got a quote that he said we should be baptized in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost well that's your head but your heart looks at things differently and your heart is going to have a close personal relationship with God there's that Clause that again you see that your heart your heart and everything your heart relationship with your wife if your heart's not in it you're just you're just going to end up glow slowly gr drawing apart until you both live on other sides of the house and you don't really care about one another anymore you're just friends but if your heart's in it it's something different you're United in that like the three parts of the house you've got the bedroom where you unite and uh real heart experience is going to be faith based in faith and trust I'm trusting in faith and my personal conviction in the word rather than some intellectual Ascent to doctrinal truths that somebody tried to teach me or somebody tried to tell me but I'm trusting in what I know to be true you see the difference sometimes that everybody wants we we'll get to this place where and I know we're all sheep and we got to have a leader and things but there's got to be a place where you come to where you know what is right or wrong and you are not trusting in just what somebody else tells you to do you got to have a Shepherd that tells you there's grass over here but there's got to come to a place where you know that this is grass and I want some more grass and you don't have to have somebody tell you and that's your personal experience your personal faith but in your head you're looking at it through reasoning and intellectual exploration you question everything every question about faith is is answer through debate and study and critical thinking and you just don't have a real experience for yourself see you can debate the the pillar of fire that Moses met all day long you can debate and argue about what what was happening was the bush really burning was the bush what kind of a bush was it and you can argue over those thing kind of things but when you have a real experience with God you know that that was God speaking to you from the bush like Moses that head looks at education it's got to study and work things out and and we all it's got to start from the head you're studying you're working things out but it's got to drop down into the heart where you're living out your faith through your actions that demonstrate love compassion and humility real love and compassion and real Fellowship not just an in institutional structure where you you just you're comeing to preserve and interpret and teach the doctrine of your particular place of worship oh that's not what God wants but God wants us to have a real experience oh think that that's that that's what church is about is having a real experience in your heart a a real a real alter call where somebody's heart begins to be moved and the tears begin to drop from their face and something begins to stir in their heart and they want some more of that they want more of God and and tonight as we're about to close we could ask that question is the Mana in your head or your heart when they were crossing the Red Sea and come over into the promised land god rained down Mana out of heaven and if they just let that man had lay just a little too long on the ground it would melt and run away just like frost or something on the ground it didn't hold and the next day they're hunting more hungry again and the same thing is happening today in Christianity he'd say many people before 9:00 get hungry again see cuz just because you receive some Mana from the Evangelist they got you all stirred up doesn't mean that you're settled just because you heard some good preaching for a little bit and you kind of got stirred up you can eat mana and be lacking now there's a mystery in it that you can eat mana and still be lacking that you can eat mana and it not hold that you can enjoy the Mana just like they did sitting there in the outer court with maybe all the unbelievers all the visitors coming through and eating Mana just the same and something not hold you can eat mana and be missing something you can eat the word of God and be missing something you can still eat you can eat mana and still be in the outer courts because it matters where you're eating at it matters where you're eating it makes a difference Jesus said he that hearth Heth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but has passed from Death unto life he that heareth my word not upon feelings or emotions or Theory some unknown something that somebody has said to you that has no basis but upon the word of God the human soul rests solid like Paul said in Hebrews 6 by two immutable things which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast and which entereth into that within the veil something anchored down in your heart the difference tonight as as the musicians come forward and we'll just close on this note the difference is from your head to your heart something something that goes from being intellectual to Something Real down in your heart I want to lay that out for you tonight are you in that kind of a condition where you're eating mana and you're enjoying it but something just ain't anchored yet maybe it's time to get honest with God and watch the devil leave if you have need of something tonight we're standing by to pray for you and pray with you Paul said in Romans chapter 12 I urge you brothers and sisters in the view of God's mer Mercy to offer your bodies as a Living Sacrifice holy and pleasing to God this is your true and proper wor Worship in Philippians chapter 1 he said for to me to for to me to live as Christ and to die is gain God wants us to just be honest about where our condition is and to give everything over to him why cuz God wants your head your heart he wants your heart tonight he wants you to love him as we'll stand to our feet and let's just worship Him and if you have a need we're happy to pray with you and pray for you sing the Wonders love of Jesus sing his
