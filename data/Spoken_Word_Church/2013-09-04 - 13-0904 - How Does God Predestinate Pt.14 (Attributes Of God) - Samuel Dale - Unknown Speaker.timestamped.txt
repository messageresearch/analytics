[4:05] attitude we try to be the best we can
[4:08] all right let's just pray Romans
[4:10] 8 dear heavenly father we thank you
[4:13] because we know one thing for
[4:15] sure that without you there is no hope
[4:18] whatsoever in any of us what in life but
[4:21] we depend totally upon you and we
[4:23] believe you we thank you and we see you
[4:25] making yourself manifest Among Us in
[4:28] many ways and we thank you for that we
[4:30] pray that you would just guide each and
[4:32] every one of us and be with us tonight
[4:34] you said in your word that you sent your
[4:36] word and healed us and delivered us from
[4:38] destruction so just come on the scene
[4:40] today and and speak to our hearts and
[4:42] our lives and then heal these old bodies
[4:44] because they're weing out and we commit
[4:47] Them All to You Lord knowing there's
[4:48] many sicknesses among us but we believe
[4:51] in an eternal God who can take care of
[4:53] them all have your way as we speak about
[4:55] you just let your light shine in each
[4:58] one of our hearts in Jesus Jesus name
[5:01] amen amen so we got Romans 8 that we've
[5:05] been reading for quite a
[5:09] while verse 28 for we know that all
[5:12] things work together for good to them
[5:14] that love God to them who are the called
[5:17] according to his purpose for whom he did
[5:19] for know he also did predestinate to be
[5:22] conformed to the image of his son that
[5:25] he might be the firstborn among many
[5:27] Brethren now remember those who we for
[5:30] know he predestinated so for knowledge
[5:33] comes
[5:36] first you you don't believe that I'm
[5:39] saying it right but most people have got
[5:41] it turned totally around they got their
[5:43] predetermining Factor uh up front you
[5:46] know where the further is back but that
[5:48] doesn't work according to the scripture
[5:50] and the prophet right all right for whom
[5:53] he did for know he also did predestinate
[5:56] to be conformed to the image of his son
[5:58] that he might be the first born among
[6:00] many Brethren moreover whom he did
[6:02] predestinate them he also called and
[6:05] whom he called them he also Justified
[6:07] and whom he justified them he also
[6:10] glorified what shall we then say to
[6:12] these things if God be Force who can be
[6:15] against us you may be seated the Lord
[6:18] add his Blessing to the reading of the
[6:22] word now we have been
[6:25] on uh how does God predestinate
[6:30] and we know as we've read here in the
[6:31] scripture that he said those he did for
[6:34] no he did predestinate so for knowledge
[6:38] comes first and that's you'll find I
[6:40] believe it's five or six quotes in the
[6:42] prophet's message um you know like
[6:45] adoptions and different things where he
[6:47] was saying said that for know for
[6:49] knowledge that predestination looks back
[6:51] to for knowledge see then you can turn
[6:54] and go the other way and see the Destiny
[6:56] coming out of what's doing it he said
[6:58] even election
[7:00] looks back to for knowledge all right so
[7:03] let's don't ever forget the point of how
[7:05] does God predestinate he predestines by
[7:07] his full knowledge all right that way
[7:10] he's not a respector of persons that's
[7:13] right that way we make our own way we
[7:17] choose our own choosing and we go you
[7:20] know and uh and I'm trying my best to
[7:23] cover some things uh about doctrines and
[7:27] issues sometimes that come up and and uh
[7:30] I know I've mentioned it to you many
[7:31] times that you know the in the old
[7:33] Baptist days they had a time there that
[7:37] uh they didn't even want to go have a
[7:39] Revival because they afraid their kids
[7:41] might get saved when God didn't want
[7:43] them saved but if you think that's wrong
[7:45] go home run in your computer two seeds
[7:49] in the
[7:51] spirit two seeds in the spirit and you
[7:55] can read exactly what I've been talking
[7:57] about the man was fighting against
[8:01] missionaries because he didn't he said
[8:03] you know why have missionaries are going
[8:05] to be saved anyway you know and and they
[8:09] had the two seeds and he goes back to
[8:12] Genesis and he says that Eve had two
[8:15] seeds there and it was a good seed and a
[8:18] bad seed The Good Seed could be saved
[8:21] The Bad Seed couldn't be saved so that's
[8:23] way on back in the 18s you know all
[8:26] right so just go back and study these
[8:28] things when I say things to you A lot of
[8:31] times I you know I expect you to to just
[8:34] say well Hey where's that at well I'll
[8:36] just a lot of times tell you where it's
[8:37] at then all right so then the doctrines
[8:40] and things of the issues that we are
[8:42] against is I'm against in any form any
[8:46] idea of you and I as being
[8:49] pre-existent as people right right I
[8:53] don't believe in pre-existence of people
[8:55] I don't believe pre-existence of any
[8:57] form other than eternal life
[9:01] right because God existed alone all
[9:05] right I believe in eternal life existing
[9:08] and that's the only way we could exist
[9:10] is in eternal life if you want to talk
[9:12] about us
[9:14] existing but why I'm worry about it why
[9:16] not just take it to where we're at you
[9:19] know because people believe that you
[9:22] come here with eternal
[9:24] life well if you did Jesus Christ died
[9:26] in vain that solved the whole problems
[9:28] with me but it doesn't with others
[9:30] because they want to quote you to death
[9:32] you know well go ahead but you can't
[9:34] quote above the word of God your quotes
[9:38] run out all right the prophet said if
[9:40] you have eternal life you always was
[9:44] eternal that's sensible right that's no
[9:47] problems that's that's sensible doings
[9:51] because you know if you have it the
[9:54] eternal life is
[9:55] eternal that's why John would say that
[9:58] you know that the seed remaineth in you
[10:00] and he and you cannot sin when the human
[10:03] being part of us can sin every day and
[10:05] the prophet said we
[10:07] did but the seed that remaineth in US
[10:09] cannot sin what seed his seed
[10:12] amen he's his seed's the only one that
[10:15] can't sin and remember we'll get to it
[10:18] later God don't have physical seeds
[10:21] right his seed is his word amen cuz he
[10:25] doesn't have physical seeds see and
[10:26] everybody wants to try to put something
[10:28] inside out of us you know why not just
[10:32] go simply the way we're going and have
[10:35] it to be that the little woman at the
[10:37] whale had representation by
[10:40] predestination all right then we can get
[10:42] back and see it in the correct order but
[10:44] remember now what we're saying
[10:48] that predestination looks
[10:52] back to forn
[10:55] knowledge forn knowledge then looks
[10:57] forward to Destiny
[11:00] all right so it's for knowledge
[11:02] first or else we miss the whole thing
[11:05] okay then not to spend much time on that
[11:08] but to try to to get it connected
[11:12] together maybe you didn't follow me as
[11:15] much this past Sunday afternoon as maybe
[11:18] I wanted you to but we talked about that
[11:23] we don't believe in Eternal
[11:25] sunship amen we showed where the Prophet
[11:28] said he didn't believe in Eternal
[11:29] sunship right all
[11:33] right then if we don't believe in
[11:36] Eternal sunship for
[11:40] Jesus then we've got to understand the
[11:43] godhead
[11:45] amen and to realize that Jesus was
[11:49] called a Son of God
[11:52] yeah but he was not God the son that's
[11:56] trinitarianism he was called a Son of
[11:58] God right
[12:00] see in no way am I trying to destroy our
[12:03] thoughts of the fact that we are Sons
[12:05] and Daughters of God Amen but just
[12:09] making sure we understand it's by the
[12:10] new birth that we come to that position
[12:14] all right then see if I don't believe in
[12:17] Eternal sunship for
[12:20] Jesus I don't believe in Eternal sunship
[12:23] for you and
[12:24] I I believe eternal life living in you
[12:29] and I makes us the children of
[12:33] God now if you want to call us Sons and
[12:35] Daughters that's fine because that's
[12:37] that's just terminologies that's what I
[12:39] was saying about when Nicodemus looked
[12:41] or not NE Nebuchadnezzar looked down in
[12:43] he said we throw three in there in
[12:46] Daniel 3 verse 25 he said we throw three
[12:49] in and said there's four down he said
[12:50] one of them is like or got the
[12:53] form the Son of God Amen well it's like
[12:56] I was trying to tell you in a sensible
[12:58] point he looks down and he knows that
[13:00] they hated they heated that thing seven
[13:02] times harder that even killed the ones
[13:05] that throw them
[13:06] in and if you look down in a hole like
[13:09] that it was burning and
[13:12] blazing and you seen three that you
[13:15] throw it in and if they were not even
[13:17] singed or or anything you know they're
[13:20] walking around you and then you look
[13:23] around and you see a fourth person there
[13:26] with anybody with one eyed in high sense
[13:28] his brother Don ruddle it was a good
[13:30] statement he
[13:31] made used to
[13:33] say you'd know then that that would have
[13:36] to be almighty
[13:37] God to take care of those other three
[13:41] well if he's almighty God and you can
[13:42] see him then you'd call him a Son of God
[13:47] right do you understand right
[13:51] Nebuchadnezzar called him a Son of
[13:53] God all right see then that a way you
[13:56] look at it and you see him and every how
[13:59] that we don't believe in Jesus be in
[14:01] Eternal sunship we've got to believe the
[14:03] same way well how is it that Jesus
[14:06] wasn't was not an eternal
[14:10] son because he was God made
[14:14] manifest in a human vessel amen right
[14:18] right and you could call him the son
[14:21] right why because you could see God he
[14:23] said if you seen me you've seen the
[14:25] father that's right all right so then
[14:29] but he it's not an eternal sunship
[14:31] because Sons always have a
[14:33] beginning the human flesh of that man we
[14:37] call Jesus had a beginning but that soul
[14:40] and that spirit inside of that man never
[14:42] had no beginning it was eternal God so
[14:46] then God didn't send a son you remember
[14:48] that he came
[14:51] himself all right are we still in the
[14:53] message the prophet said he came himself
[14:56] all right so then how is it that he he
[15:00] would be who he
[15:02] is is the same way you and I are who we
[15:05] are
[15:07] am the only difference was
[15:11] he Soul and Spirit was
[15:16] eternal we come into the world Body
[15:18] Spirit and soul lost
[15:22] amen oh of course if you believe you
[15:24] come into the world with eternal life in
[15:25] your
[15:27] soul now look what a situation you got
[15:30] right you got to admit the soul is lost
[15:33] right amen I mean you got to admit that
[15:36] I mean in one out in high sense figure
[15:39] that out you got to admit it well if
[15:41] you're lost but yet you got eternal life
[15:44] now how can you be lost and have eternal
[15:47] life I don't have no education I'm sorry
[15:51] I got a ninth grade education that's all
[15:53] I was able to get I work for a
[15:57] living but listen
[16:00] how could you have an eternal
[16:05] sinner sister Gail if you're a sinner
[16:08] and you then but you have eternal life
[16:10] you're an eternal sinner I mean
[16:12] languages Ain ain't messed up too
[16:15] bad right that's as plain as it can
[16:17] be amen but why is it that people
[16:21] believe it that way that's right I came
[16:22] with this eternal
[16:26] life quotes yeah they've got
[16:32] quotes but what are you doing with
[16:34] quotes you're killing
[16:38] yourself why is it they're doing away
[16:41] with the Simplicity of the
[16:45] messag the prophet said go on with the
[16:48] same simple message or else you'll work
[16:49] yourself away from
[16:52] it well why can't we just stay with the
[16:54] same simple
[16:56] message I believe you must be justified
[16:59] Sanctified and filled with the Holy
[17:01] Ghost that is the new birth and that's
[17:03] the only way you have eternal life but
[17:06] once you receive that eternal life that
[17:08] eternal life is a part of God Amen and
[17:12] that eternal life was always Eternal
[17:15] right it's just a time that I wasn't
[17:18] Eternal yes what brother Dale oh brother
[17:20] so and so preaches that and it's just
[17:21] it's just so great and he's so sweet to
[17:23] till I just get excited about who I was
[17:26] and what I am
[17:27] and what
[17:30] I'm
[17:31] sorry you know you're stuck with me like
[17:33] it is I just don't have no other way of
[17:36] presenting other than just telling you
[17:37] what I believe amen
[17:40] amen and just say that's the way it goes
[17:43] whether you like it or not see God
[17:46] appeared in many
[17:50] forms
[17:53] right but there's only one
[17:56] person of God right right that's right I
[18:00] see then we don't believe in Eternal
[18:04] sunship he appeared in a form called a
[18:08] son but that was just a form that was
[18:12] just words or
[18:13] terms to be used because you can't have
[18:17] eternal
[18:18] sunship
[18:21] right but you can have eternal
[18:24] godship that's what the prophet
[18:27] said all right but think about it
[18:31] now if there's only one true and living
[18:35] God then then we don't believe in
[18:37] Eternal sunship for
[18:40] him then we truly don't believe in
[18:43] Eternal sunship for us
[18:48] right the Bible says as he is so are we
[18:51] in this world all right you said well
[18:54] what do you believe then brother Dale I
[18:56] believe the eternal life
[19:01] that God has always was
[19:06] eternal and I believe it may be
[19:08] different than what a lot of people
[19:09] tried to
[19:10] explain
[19:12] but did God choose us to be his children
[19:16] I asked someone this the other day did
[19:18] he choose us to be his
[19:21] children you better listen
[19:24] now sounds good doesn't it he chose me
[19:28] to be be his child did he choose you to
[19:30] be his child no or was you always his
[19:34] child that's
[19:38] right you see why I preached Eternal
[19:40] sunship in that position because I knew
[19:43] most of your minds would be running back
[19:46] into the form of saying brother
[19:49] Dale if you believe the children of God
[19:53] are God made
[19:57] manifest then you're going to run me
[19:59] into an eternal sunship thought and
[20:02] that's not true that's why I preached it
[20:04] first you can't have eternal
[20:08] sunship you understand the point of
[20:10] asking the question did God actually
[20:13] choose us to be what we
[20:16] are are we his offspring amen which one
[20:20] is
[20:21] it if we're his
[20:24] offspring he never chose for us to be
[20:27] his children he had children
[20:31] right amen well hell then then that push
[20:36] us back there now the children he has is
[20:39] the same children he is right
[20:44] amen he's Eternal
[20:47] amen his children are
[20:51] Eternal we just had to come into this
[20:53] world for it to be an impartation into
[20:56] these human vessels we look at right
[21:02] you said well I hadn't thought of it
[21:04] like that well maybe you ought to
[21:07] think is a child of
[21:10] God a second
[21:13] person from
[21:16] God that's all the simple questions I
[21:20] ask are you a child of God being
[21:23] different from
[21:27] God well then you don't have eternal
[21:30] life cuz you're moving yourself away
[21:32] from
[21:33] it but if you're an offspring of God if
[21:37] you're a child of God and that doesn't
[21:40] mean the children of was running around
[21:42] up in there you talk I'm talking about
[21:44] eternal life amen
[21:46] right wouldn't a bunch of us people
[21:48] running around up in heaven that's
[21:49] Mormon
[21:52] doctrines those are not true we were not
[21:55] there we'll get to it tonight we were
[21:56] there only as an attribute right
[22:00] right and attributes are the thoughts of
[22:03] God
[22:07] right there was no people back there he
[22:10] was self-existing
[22:12] but he existed with his attributes you
[22:15] agree
[22:16] amen I don't ask you to I'm just
[22:19] saying he existed with his attributes he
[22:22] existed with his thoughts and God's
[22:25] thoughts are eternal
[22:30] the prophet said that gives an eternal
[22:31] quality to the
[22:33] elect why can't we simply believe CU
[22:37] remember now we're up be we're back by
[22:40] the way of the Prophet message we're
[22:42] back in God's
[22:43] mind we'll move back over in another
[22:46] message or two and start down through
[22:49] time and see how for knowledge and
[22:52] predestination gets involved and how the
[22:54] seed gets involved and and what all of
[22:56] that is
[23:00] but what I'm trying to get you and I to
[23:01] look at tonight is one
[23:04] thing I believe in an eternal God I
[23:06] believe in Eternal
[23:08] godship but not an eternal sunship am
[23:12] whether it be you me or whether it even
[23:14] be
[23:15] Jesus because Jesus was a Son of God
[23:19] only in the basis that God was
[23:21] manifested in that
[23:25] flesh and he was called a son amen why
[23:28] do you think they killed
[23:32] him come on why did they kill
[23:36] Jesus what did what did they say you're
[23:39] a man making yourself God no it was God
[23:42] making himself a man they just had it
[23:44] backwards in
[23:47] it but still they killed him because of
[23:50] who he was saying he
[23:52] was he wasn't saying he was a second
[23:55] person
[23:59] he was saying that he was God manifested
[24:01] in flesh that's why they killed him so
[24:04] will they do it again the end time and
[24:07] right now they're not trying to kill you
[24:08] they're going they're trying to kill
[24:09] your
[24:11] influence but they'll come down to even
[24:13] killing you for
[24:16] it see my point was trying to get up to
[24:20] us I don't believe in Eternal sunship
[24:22] for Jesus Christ and I don't believe in
[24:24] Eternal ship for you and I but I believe
[24:28] in a God that has given eternal life to
[24:31] a people amen that's right but that
[24:34] eternal life was in him in the
[24:37] beginning that was his
[24:39] offspring so I ask you the question
[24:41] again did God choose for us to be his
[24:48] children are are we his children by
[24:52] having eternal life am
[24:58] which one is
[25:00] it if he chose us to be his children
[25:04] that's predetermining
[25:07] right so you done got back in your
[25:09] predestination
[25:11] Doctrine right come
[25:14] on if he sat back before the world and
[25:16] looked down even and saw like people try
[25:19] to
[25:20] make that's my children then he was
[25:25] predetermining the prophet of God we
[25:27] went through message after message after
[25:30] message that he don't predestinate by
[25:32] his desires that's right
[25:37] amen he predestines by your desires and
[25:40] my desires whether we desire to be saved
[25:43] or not it's why he gave us a free moral
[25:45] agency right amen they won't deal people
[25:48] that that are in their Eternal sunship I
[25:49] mean excuse me or not I said it that way
[25:51] but that's what they're
[25:53] in when you get into these
[25:54] predestination doctrines and I really
[25:57] didn't mean to say that now so don't
[25:59] think I was trick saying
[26:02] it when you get into predestination
[26:05] doctrines and you predetermining
[26:06] something then you're going to have to
[26:08] go to sunship with
[26:12] it come on you got sense think it over
[26:17] you're going to have to go to sunship
[26:19] and when you go to sunship you're going
[26:20] to go to Eternal
[26:24] sunship you don't believe brother Dale
[26:26] that we come into the world with eternal
[26:27] eye no
[26:29] amen emphatically no amen if you did
[26:34] Jesus Christ died in
[26:36] vain you destroyed the whole Bible in
[26:38] the prophet's message of course we want
[26:40] everything after
[26:44] 63 you can't understand this message if
[26:46] you don't understand up to 63
[26:49] amen and then understand what he's
[26:51] talking about right but see that's the
[26:54] way people are all right see I believe
[26:58] then by the new
[27:01] birth I believe on the day of Pentecost
[27:04] that there was 120 Little Seeds the
[27:07] prophet said spoken words Original Seed
[27:09] we'll get back to this pulled up into
[27:11] the upper room waiting what were they
[27:13] waiting
[27:16] on if there always was eternal what was
[27:19] they waiting
[27:21] on why was they scared to
[27:25] death they waser coming out of that
[27:27] upper room right that's
[27:31] right but when the Holy Ghost fell they
[27:35] went right
[27:36] out why because it brought them eternal
[27:38] life you shall receive the gift of the
[27:40] Holy Ghost the prophet of God said what
[27:42] is the gift of the Holy Ghost he said
[27:44] eternal life through Jesus
[27:47] Christ there's no way to get eternal
[27:49] life outside of Jesus
[27:53] Christ cuz he was almighty God
[27:58] see then we are the children of God
[28:00] which means that we are his
[28:04] offspring we are his
[28:07] offspring he said don't think it man's
[28:10] filter it could not be well go ahead
[28:12] let's do that number two let's read it
[28:14] cuz I want to get that
[28:16] point pull up number
[28:19] two that's e 12
[28:23] of thirsting for Life
[28:27] 1957 he said talking about the facts of
[28:29] our faith the book you know and they use
[28:32] the word of Eternal sunship of God the
[28:34] word don't even make sense to me the
[28:36] word Eternal means eternity which had no
[28:38] beginning or has no end and Son means
[28:41] had a beginning so how could it be it
[28:44] could be a Eternal
[28:47] godship watch him but never an eternal
[28:51] sunship a son is one that's begotten of
[28:54] so it had a beginning you say well but
[28:56] Brother D you you're confusing me
[28:59] because I always thought I was I thought
[29:00] people were were Sons and Daughters of
[29:02] God Amen if you're born
[29:05] again
[29:09] right well now now you're saying you
[29:10] don't believe in any I don't believe in
[29:12] Eternal
[29:16] sunship I believe in Eternal
[29:19] godship I believe it's a prophet of God
[29:21] said I gave it to you there he said I
[29:23] believe in Eternal godhead right
[29:28] well that's father son holy
[29:33] ghost that it's father son well that
[29:36] that's got to mean
[29:38] this no those are the manifestations of
[29:42] God that we'll get to in a minute those
[29:44] are the form of God there was a time
[29:45] when he was father there was a time when
[29:47] he was son there's a time now the Holy
[29:49] Spirit that's father son Holy Ghost cu
[29:51] the Bible said in
[29:54] him dwelt the fullness of the godhead
[29:56] bodily
[29:58] so I believe in Eternal godhead right
[30:00] right because I believe that son that
[30:03] came out from God in the beginning that
[30:05] your Prophet
[30:07] explained is the lost to speech the one
[30:09] who created I believe that was almighty
[30:12] God in another form not an eternal son
[30:15] sent out to
[30:17] speak was eternal God in another form
[30:20] when Jesus stood right there on Earth he
[30:21] said unless you believe that I am he you
[30:23] will die in your sins oh no they just
[30:27] had to believe in Son of God that
[30:29] wouldn't what he was talking
[30:31] about that he he was talking about
[30:33] unless you believe that I am almighty
[30:35] God that's what I said that's why they
[30:37] killed
[30:38] him they knew what he was
[30:43] saying they also knew that he was trying
[30:45] his best to tell them that they were not
[30:47] Eternal at that
[30:50] time but yet they believe they
[30:53] were done been through that they believe
[30:57] they were Eternal because they were the
[30:59] chosen of
[31:02] God but that's where people don't
[31:04] believe the way I believe it I'm sorry
[31:06] that's all right I don't believe Those
[31:08] Old Testament Saints had eternal life in
[31:10] their
[31:12] soul
[31:14] right yet I was looking at one today
[31:16] where brother R was talking about well
[31:19] um you believe that U Saul was saved he
[31:23] said well sure I
[31:25] do right I believe Saul was saved
[31:29] MH but what was was the Salvation back
[31:36] then if they had eternal life why did
[31:40] they have to go to paradise why did they
[31:43] not go straight into the presence of
[31:45] almighty God
[31:47] right that's right they had to go to
[31:50] paradise to wait until Jesus Christ
[31:54] came see you just make eternal life just
[31:57] a it out just giving it to well they got
[31:59] it the got it that got it eternal life
[32:02] is a person it's the person of almighty
[32:05] God Amen and they couldn't have that
[32:07] eternal life until that man come to
[32:09] Earth we called Jesus and within him was
[32:12] that eternal life and it was released at
[32:15] Calvary when it was released at Calvary
[32:17] it came back on them on the day of
[32:19] Pentecost and then they had eternal life
[32:22] right then the eternal life they had
[32:25] always was eternal
[32:28] right right that was God's Offspring
[32:30] starting out that was the expanding of
[32:32] God
[32:35] Amen not into sunship right listen what
[32:40] he says in the next one go
[32:42] ahead try to stay with my notes if I can
[32:45] all right it's hard to do look at number
[32:52] three just look at the things he says
[32:56] 1962 401 of course I know that's back
[32:59] before the seals was preached and the
[33:02] prophet was wrong but no we're not
[33:03] saying he was
[33:05] wrong we just say he didn't
[33:09] understand well according to my
[33:12] understanding now sorry I thought he was
[33:15] born the
[33:17] prophet I thought the word was to come
[33:20] to the prophet I didn't know it was to
[33:22] come to you and me only by way of the
[33:25] Prophet amen that's right that's right
[33:32] but yet that's the way people are see
[33:33] they always want to straighten something
[33:34] out I'd like to ask the question how
[33:37] many of you can make any sense out of
[33:39] Eternal sunship of God if he was a
[33:43] son he had a
[33:45] beginning if he was eternal son how
[33:48] could he be a son and be Eternal for a
[33:51] son is a product of something but if he
[33:54] was he was could not be an eternal son
[33:57] there's no such a thing Eternal Son of
[33:59] God because if if he never had a
[34:03] beginning then he cannot be nothing but
[34:05] Eternal but if he was a son he had a
[34:08] beginning so he cannot be an eternal son
[34:12] watch him it was the Eternal God
[34:16] manifested in a
[34:18] son right uh-huh Eternal God cuz God is
[34:22] the only thing that's Eternal Eternal
[34:24] God that's who Jesus Christ was that's
[34:26] why I said to people people don't
[34:28] understand the
[34:30] godhead they make Jesus the son of
[34:35] God a second
[34:37] person the first one I had to read and
[34:41] quote it to you the other day I want to
[34:42] ask you to pull it back but look what he
[34:45] says on the unveiling of God paragraph
[34:47] 77 and
[34:49] 78 64 61 uh 61
[34:54] 614 he poured himself out Christ in the
[34:57] people Christ in you he poured himself
[35:01] out God all the
[35:03] fullness all the godhead bodily was in
[35:06] this person Jesus Christ he was God and
[35:09] God Alone Now
[35:11] listen not a third
[35:14] person or a second
[35:16] person or a first
[35:22] person but the person God veiled in
[35:25] human flesh amen amen
[35:28] see cuz if he was the first person you
[35:30] call him that then that would give you
[35:32] the implication there could be more
[35:34] persons
[35:36] right see it's not true then all right
[35:39] look where we're
[35:42] at where' we get two number three right
[35:44] go on to number
[35:46] four I want to get these out of the way
[35:48] back onto your mind
[35:51] see now this is one where we go after
[35:54] the seals with it to make sure people
[35:55] just want to understand that you know 63
[35:57] 804 calling Jesus on the scene paragraph
[36:02] 4647 and when you Catholic people say
[36:04] Eternal ship sunship where did you get
[36:06] such a word it doesn't make sense to me
[36:09] how can he be Eternal and be a son now
[36:11] this is
[36:12] 63804 that's after the seals right so he
[36:16] still got the same point how can he be
[36:19] Eternal and be a son a son is something
[36:21] that's begotten of and how can it be
[36:23] Eternal Eternal never did begin it never
[36:26] does end so how could it be Eternal
[36:29] sunship oh my if these denominations
[36:33] hasn't scrupled things
[36:39] up I'll stop right
[36:42] there because that's my point the
[36:45] denominations in the message is scrupled
[36:47] it up that's right that's
[36:50] right
[36:54] okay but listen
[36:58] we're going to go through tonight
[36:59] because if we don't finish tonight we'll
[37:01] finish it
[37:03] Sunday see I
[37:06] believe and I've always taught you that
[37:09] God never gained attributes as he came
[37:12] down or
[37:14] condescended that he always had the
[37:17] attributes in
[37:19] him but they were not made
[37:23] manifest he didn't gain attributes
[37:26] coming this way he dis displayed his
[37:29] attributes he always was a Healer but
[37:31] there was nobody sick he always was a
[37:34] savior but there was nobody to be saved
[37:36] but still he had the
[37:40] attributes all
[37:44] right what are the attributes of
[37:52] God what are
[37:55] they God has three attributes
[38:00] father son Holy Spirit Holy Ghost either
[38:03] which way you want to use
[38:05] it he has three
[38:08] attributes all right he has many forms
[38:11] now that those three attributes can be
[38:13] displayed
[38:15] in but there's still just three
[38:17] attributes of God father son Holy Ghost
[38:20] all right
[38:22] now if we can find some way that you and
[38:25] I are a part of those attri
[38:31] rutes I believe in the attributes of God
[38:33] are
[38:34] Eternal and not every time you want to
[38:37] use attribute because he said you're an
[38:38] attribute of your father you're
[38:40] attribute of your mother
[38:42] but get the
[38:44] point what are the attributes of
[38:48] God so everything that we receive here
[38:52] in life comes from one of those three
[38:55] attributes or all of them together
[38:56] either way you want want to State it
[38:58] that's up to
[38:59] you because all of those attributes are
[39:02] the same person we just read it there's
[39:05] only one person there's only one God and
[39:08] he has
[39:09] attributes he had those attributes
[39:11] before the world ever
[39:15] begun the prophet says on Christ a
[39:17] mystery of God reveal we went through
[39:19] that he had a plan and a purpose that he
[39:21] was going to achieve in order to let
[39:23] himself be expressed
[39:29] right so what are the attributes of
[39:35] God the attributes of
[39:39] God let's just let the prophet answer it
[39:43] look at number five is to make sure you
[39:45] get all of this and keep it
[39:49] straight this is taken from works as
[39:51] Faith Express 65 11:26 paragraph 204 and
[39:55] remember you're in a cycle of three but
[39:58] you're one person like father son Holy
[40:00] Ghost cycle of three but one person
[40:03] three attributes of the same God father
[40:05] had three offices like fatherhood
[40:06] sunship Holy Ghost and your body Spirit
[40:09] Soul all right three attributes okay we
[40:11] got the three attributes just in case
[40:13] somebody out there doesn't know these
[40:15] things all right look to the next one
[40:17] se's not a with a shook
[40:21] 65 paragraph
[40:23] 33 run it on up because the other part
[40:25] you can read it see this all God all all
[40:29] alone God manifesting himself working
[40:31] himself through through different
[40:34] ages so those three of Father Son and
[40:37] Holy Spirit same God working in three
[40:40] attributes and we today are one the
[40:43] church itself an
[40:47] attribute of God's
[40:50] thinking before the word foundation of
[40:53] the world to have a church so that those
[40:56] which are in Christ was in Christ at the
[40:58] beginning that was his thoughts and his
[41:01] thoughts is his
[41:06] attributes now the prophet said he dwelt
[41:08] alone with his
[41:10] thoughts he was self-existing
[41:13] if you put us back there in any
[41:18] form other than the eternal life that we
[41:23] have look what you've just done he would
[41:25] not be self-existing
[41:28] amen and remember he stayed
[41:31] self-existing
[41:32] even after he created the angels that
[41:36] only made him
[41:38] God he was still self-existing
[41:42] until he created man in Genesis 1:26 and
[41:49] 27 all
[41:51] right you see what it
[41:54] was we are the attribute of
[42:00] God let me ask you a question you ever
[42:02] been
[42:05] healed it was his
[42:09] attribute are you saved am that's his
[42:14] attribute it's his
[42:17] attributes now that's what we're
[42:19] covering tonight what are the attributes
[42:21] of God they're the thoughts of
[42:25] God what are the thoughts of God they're
[42:27] his
[42:29] attributes so he dwelt
[42:35] alone we wasn't with him in any form
[42:38] other than that eternal life that he
[42:45] has and that was his
[42:50] children his
[42:54] offspring but not back there in any form
[42:58] to where we could even connect to an
[42:59] eternal
[43:02] sunship we were only back there in his
[43:06] thinking in his mind we've covered those
[43:09] messages over and
[43:12] over God dwelt
[43:15] Alone he was self-existing so that mean
[43:19] he's dwelt by himself with the times he
[43:21] was dwelling by himself or wherever he
[43:23] was by himself before anything ever
[43:25] appeared he already had attributes
[43:32] right and that's the eternal life you
[43:34] receed by the new
[43:39] birth he's just making us hear what that
[43:43] eternal life was
[43:44] there brother D do you believe we were
[43:47] back there we were back there only as
[43:49] attributes
[43:53] am now here's one that I'd suggest you
[43:56] right down or calculate in your mind and
[43:59] keep
[44:02] it we're going to have to get over a
[44:04] long ways before we start talking about
[44:07] the connection to the Earth and
[44:11] life and the morning star sang together
[44:14] and the sons of God shouted for
[44:17] Joy it's going to take a while to get to
[44:20] there so while we're thinking about
[44:22] think about eternal
[44:25] life and then you'll see why the prophet
[44:27] would say if you have eternal life
[44:31] amen you always was eternal am
[44:36] right if you have
[44:38] it he said if you don't have it you're
[44:42] not Eternal and never will be if you
[44:43] don't receive
[44:46] it all
[44:48] right so then what are the thoughts of
[44:51] God what are
[44:56] we we're an attribute of God's thinking
[44:59] before the foundation of the world to
[45:01] have a
[45:04] church so those which are in Christ was
[45:07] in Christ at the
[45:09] beginning that was his
[45:11] thoughts and his thoughts as his
[45:15] attributes so now there's nobody there
[45:18] he's by
[45:22] himself his children were within him
[45:27] they were just part of eternal life if
[45:29] he was eternal not his people sitting
[45:32] around inside of him here there they
[45:34] draw it out remember the two Soul people
[45:36] remember them how they draw it out they
[45:38] put these dots and these circles and
[45:40] these things and and all and you
[45:41] happened to be here you was all right
[45:43] but if he was over here you couldn't get
[45:44] saved
[45:46] and same old doctrines still
[45:52] today
[45:54] listen look what he goes on to say on a
[45:56] message called a shame 1965 711 and I
[46:00] hope you will pay attention that all of
[46:02] these quotes that I'll be using the rest
[46:03] of the message 90% of them is after the
[46:06] seals broke so you know that's where the
[46:09] people say he increased in his message
[46:12] to
[46:16] understand I can show you back in the
[46:18] 50s where he understood
[46:24] right oh no
[46:28] message of Shame 1965 711 and I said
[46:32] what would you do if you were sitting in
[46:33] a meeting and seen God the Holy Spirit
[46:36] which is the only God there is working
[46:38] amongst the people God in the fatherhood
[46:40] the pillar of fire and the prophets god
[46:43] listen now watch what he's saying God in
[46:46] the
[46:47] Father the pillar of
[46:52] fire and the
[46:54] prophets God and his son
[46:58] than God and his
[47:01] people covers a pretty good lot of
[47:03] ground doesn't
[47:04] he it's just attributes of
[47:08] God one great God who covers
[47:15] eternity
[47:17] right so it's the
[47:20] attributes you are the attribute of your
[47:25] father but there's no way you could
[47:27] remember being in your
[47:30] father and especially no way you could
[47:32] have any connection to your grandfather
[47:35] because in your grandfather you was not
[47:37] a germ he was only a gene in the DNA
[47:40] makeup right right only through the
[47:43] bedding ground of Mother and Daddy in
[47:45] the to that could he be father in the
[47:48] fact of it coming to a germ or a
[47:54] sperm but that's only the natural
[48:00] story butale do you believe in Eternal
[48:03] sunship no right do you believe in
[48:05] Eternal God
[48:09] yes I believe God is eternal and if you
[48:11] have eternal life the eternal life we
[48:13] have is God's own
[48:17] life that he gave for you and I right
[48:20] amen
[48:29] a court trial
[48:31] 1964 412 paragraph
[48:35] 257 there is no three or four Gods
[48:38] there's only one God there is three
[48:41] attributes of God Father Son and Holy
[48:43] Ghost but they're not three
[48:46] Gods he said that's
[48:49] heathenism see there is only one God and
[48:52] that's
[48:55] attributes God the father was in the
[48:57] wilderness and he goes down explaining
[48:59] coming
[49:01] down
[49:04] attributes we're seeing those attributes
[49:06] displayed going to the next one sir we
[49:09] would see Jesus 64318 paragraph
[49:12] 8182 in the beginning God was not even
[49:15] God he was the great Eternal and there
[49:17] were attributes attributes was his
[49:21] thoughts and
[49:23] then then means at that time or shortly
[49:27] thereafter Webster says it and then he
[49:31] became a word like this the word express
[49:35] well a thought expressed is a word and a
[49:37] word expressed is a thought and then
[49:40] remember if you ever was in God's
[49:45] thinking you'll always be
[49:49] there if you got eternal
[49:52] life you are the expression or the ATT
[49:56] rute of his thought for this
[50:01] age
[50:04] right that's who we
[50:07] are look at the next
[50:11] one God is identified by his
[50:13] characteristics 64 311 paragraph 19 and
[50:17] the whole thing is the great Eternal
[50:20] eternity never did begin and never can
[50:22] end therefore in this great Eternal one
[50:25] was attributes to be father to be son to
[50:28] be savior to be healer and these things
[50:30] was in him and only things that's
[50:33] happening now is a displaying his
[50:39] attributes that's all that's happening
[50:41] now look at the next
[50:43] one proving his word 64816 paragraph 180
[50:48] 181 through
[50:50] 182 and there stood the priest said this
[50:54] man is Bells above see no
[51:00] representation right he had no
[51:03] representation the little woman at the
[51:05] whale had representation from
[51:06] predestination we'll get to
[51:08] that that's why she would say that that
[51:11] you're the Messiah you know that Prophet
[51:14] whereas they would call him
[51:16] belba eternal life you always what see
[51:18] you have eternal life there's only one
[51:20] form of it that's God you were his
[51:22] attribute he thought of you and knowed
[51:25] you before the foundation of the world
[51:27] in his mind see but there's no
[51:30] representation in Heaven by the priest
[51:33] there wasn't in God's thinking at all
[51:36] but the woman was we'll get back to
[51:38] these things we're definitely not
[51:41] through with the
[51:42] message if you get bored with what we're
[51:44] talking about then maybe you're through
[51:46] with the
[51:48] message look at this one there thinking
[51:50] man's filter
[51:52] 1965 822 paragraph 71 through uh
[51:57] 71 yeah it's 71 excuse
[52:01] me but when you're born to the spirit of
[52:05] God of course if you believe you come
[52:08] into the world with eternal life you
[52:09] don't need to be born
[52:12] again the Born Again experience to those
[52:15] that that come Eternal would only be a
[52:18] knowledge of who you
[52:21] are and Nicodemus had
[52:25] that the Jesus said you must be born
[52:29] again see this is 65 now and when you're
[52:32] born of the spirit of God then you got
[52:34] you're a Son of God and you always was a
[52:37] Son of God and you always will be a Son
[52:39] of God no way to separate it because it
[52:42] you have eternal life and eternal life
[52:44] never did begin neither will it ever end
[52:47] see if you have eternal
[52:50] life there's no
[52:53] way that that this comes in Us by the
[52:55] new birth
[52:57] is eternal sunship or any form it's God
[53:01] in another form called the holy
[53:03] ghost that comes and lives in our hearts
[53:05] to make us
[53:07] Eternal or to bring to
[53:11] us what we were that's no problem with
[53:15] me have no
[53:17] problem we're saying that the eternal
[53:20] life that I have was in God before the
[53:22] world
[53:23] begun and has now been given to me
[53:28] and he bringing me to the knowledge of
[53:30] an understanding of who I am amen and
[53:34] that's what your Prophet said he said
[53:36] when the bride realizes who she is and
[53:38] what she's here for said she'll be
[53:41] gone
[53:44] right now look what he says in who is
[53:46] this Mel
[53:48] chdc this will be quite a bit of reading
[53:50] so hold
[53:52] on in the beginning God dwelt Alone with
[53:56] his attributes as I spoke of this
[53:59] morning that's his thoughts there was
[54:01] nothing just God alone but he had
[54:04] thoughts now that's simple enough there
[54:06] was
[54:09] nothing let's see what was that man said
[54:11] that time nothing from nothing will
[54:12] leave
[54:16] nothing so nothing is as far as you can
[54:21] go because if you go anything pass
[54:23] nothing you're coming back to something
[54:27] so nothing is
[54:28] nothing God dwelt
[54:31] Alone is any problem with
[54:37] that yeah but but but now here's what
[54:40] but brother
[54:41] Dale When The Morning Star saying
[54:44] together in the sons of God Shadow for
[54:45] joy we was back there then don't you
[54:47] agree wait till we get to the message
[54:49] and you'll
[54:52] see as I said be careful
[54:56] when you start dealing with
[54:59] predestination you better deal with for
[55:02] knowledge
[55:07] first there could have been no Morning
[55:10] Star sing together and sons of God
[55:11] shouted for Joy had they not been God's
[55:14] attributes in him before the world ever
[55:20] begun and
[55:22] remember when that comes into
[55:25] being the sons of God shouting for Joy
[55:28] the cherubims had already been created
[55:30] the Angels so then God had done started
[55:34] condescending because that's what it
[55:36] says the morning Stars which are the
[55:39] cherubims
[55:42] Angels so it's already started this
[55:45] way that's what I said we're back over
[55:47] here now let's just stay over there for
[55:49] a little while and just read what your
[55:50] Prophet has to say about these
[55:52] things all right he dwelt alone with his
[55:55] attributes
[55:56] as I spoke of this morning that's his
[55:58] thoughts there was nothing just God
[56:00] alone but he had thoughts drop on down
[56:02] reading you can read the whole thing and
[56:04] don't worry about reading all of it cuz
[56:05] it'll be there paragraph 48 notice those
[56:08] who have eternal life was with him and
[56:10] in him in his thinking before there ever
[56:13] was an angel star cherubim or anything
[56:22] else that's
[56:24] Eternal and if you have eternal life
[56:27] you always
[56:29] was then what did he say not your being
[56:35] here but the shape and form that the
[56:38] infinite
[56:43] God so we wasn't back there in any shape
[56:46] form or
[56:51] fashion no one say was back there was
[56:53] eternal life
[57:01] right and
[57:04] remember listen to what he thinks about
[57:07] you now remember the point okay then
[57:10] when we read this remember the
[57:14] point he was saying he dwelt
[57:19] alone then he begins to
[57:23] describe his offspring
[57:30] he said well that's putting us back
[57:33] there is
[57:36] it and remember you your eyes your
[57:40] stature whatever you was you were in his
[57:44] thinking at the
[57:47] beginning just remember that's his
[57:49] thinking he didn't say we were back
[57:52] there as persons peoples
[57:59] if he had children he ought to know what
[58:00] his children look
[58:02] like the only thing that you are is the
[58:04] expression word after he thought it he
[58:08] spoke it and you you are if it isn't you
[58:10] wasn't in his thinking there is no way
[58:12] at all for you ever to be there for he
[58:14] is the one that gives eternal life he
[58:17] wouldn't in you thinking then you'll
[58:18] never be there come
[58:21] on you say well that makes
[58:24] him predetermined determining nope you
[58:29] get on down later he just makes
[58:31] everybody and gives them a
[58:33] choice right come on we're not lost
[58:38] remember how he read the scriptures not
[58:39] him that willth or him that runneth but
[58:41] God and that his predestination might
[58:45] stand
[58:46] true he could choose before any time who
[58:51] God is Sovereign in his choosing did you
[58:54] know that God is sovereign so he could
[58:57] choose now you got him contradictory to
[59:01] himself when he said he didn't
[59:03] choose now what are you going to do with
[59:07] it the prophet says he doesn't choose by
[59:10] his own
[59:12] desires he doesn't predestinate to make
[59:15] sure the word is correct by his own
[59:17] desires now he's talking about something
[59:18] look like it's
[59:21] predestinated by his
[59:23] choosing so ask you the question again
[59:27] did God set back before the world and
[59:29] choose people to be his children or has
[59:33] he set back before the world were his
[59:35] children a part of
[59:39] him now which one is it that way I don't
[59:41] have to back
[59:43] off I don't have to say brother Rand was
[59:45] right here and wrong here they both tied
[59:49] together you see a preacher start saying
[59:51] brother random must have misunderstood
[59:53] here or didn't know here or just need to
[59:55] correct him here here something you got
[59:57] a
[59:57] problem yeah I'll just put it in plain
[1:00:00] language that preacher don't have
[1:00:01] eternal life cuz if you had eternal life
[1:00:03] he wouldn't be that
[1:00:07] dumb
[1:00:10] sorry but
[1:00:13] listen even your eyes your
[1:00:17] stature but is he talking about this
[1:00:19] thing that you're looking
[1:00:23] at or is he talking as the Prophet said
[1:00:27] that God took a picture of you and
[1:00:29] I when he said oh about 18 years old
[1:00:33] that's a good
[1:00:34] one but keep on
[1:00:37] reading when did he say he took the
[1:00:40] picture before the foundation of the
[1:00:45] world and your name was written in the
[1:00:48] lounge book of life before the
[1:00:49] foundation the world but he said maybe
[1:00:51] not your name you have
[1:00:59] might not be
[1:01:03] Freda
[1:01:05] right follow
[1:01:08] me let's keep on going we got a little
[1:01:12] time look what he says God's provided
[1:01:14] place of worship 65 425 paragraph
[1:01:19] 38 so if he's infinite and he does not
[1:01:22] do that because he is is perfect in
[1:01:25] every word
[1:01:26] he never utters a word unless it's
[1:01:28] Eternal now that's
[1:01:31] wonderful all of his
[1:01:33] eternals now I like
[1:01:36] that all of his eternals was with him at
[1:01:40] the
[1:01:43] beginning that's a good
[1:01:46] statement his thoughts his
[1:01:49] attributes and they're only expressing
[1:01:51] themselves in the world
[1:01:54] today well to the
[1:01:57] next God who is rich in Mercy 65 11 11
[1:02:05] 119 now if you've got eternal life
[1:02:09] tonight if we have eternal
[1:02:12] life then we was always
[1:02:15] were that's wonderful if you have it but
[1:02:19] what if you don't have
[1:02:24] it because there's only one form of
[1:02:26] eternal life you always were and the
[1:02:29] reason we were because we are
[1:02:31] a part of
[1:02:34] God and God is the only thing that's
[1:02:37] Eternal never remember the message part
[1:02:40] of
[1:02:43] God couple of weeks
[1:02:45] ago part of
[1:02:47] God that's what I was preaching there is
[1:02:50] what I'm preaching now a part of God is
[1:02:53] his offspring
[1:02:56] right his
[1:02:58] attributes and that's what you and I are
[1:03:00] not peoples back there with him
[1:03:04] attributes his
[1:03:07] thoughts his
[1:03:12] children
[1:03:15] okay now we are a part of
[1:03:19] God you always
[1:03:21] was you don't remember it because you're
[1:03:23] only an attribute you because you were
[1:03:26] only an attribute in God you were only
[1:03:28] in his thinking no problem your very
[1:03:31] name if you ever was on the book of life
[1:03:34] it was put there before the foundation
[1:03:35] of the world he knew what you
[1:03:38] were you don't know who you
[1:03:43] are you don't know who you are you are
[1:03:47] not going to be but now you are the sons
[1:03:49] of God see always were the sons of God
[1:03:53] now does that destroy you know do going
[1:03:55] to run you said while ago we wasn't the
[1:03:58] sons of God I explain what a son
[1:04:03] is a son is God
[1:04:06] himself in another form called a
[1:04:10] son that's what he's talking about here
[1:04:13] he's not going
[1:04:15] away for when God had you in his
[1:04:17] thinking at the beginning you have to be
[1:04:19] some part of you your life that's in you
[1:04:22] now had to be with God before there
[1:04:27] well when he before he even became
[1:04:30] material here on Earth before there was
[1:04:33] anything but God you were one of his
[1:04:35] attributes he knowed what your name
[1:04:38] would be he know the color of your high
[1:04:41] would be would have he knowed all about
[1:04:44] you the only thing happened is when you
[1:04:48] being a sinner in other words you drop
[1:04:50] on down you come down here to Center all
[1:04:52] right now
[1:04:55] lean not to your own understanding
[1:04:58] 1965
[1:05:01] 120 so you see if you were in the for
[1:05:03] knowledge of
[1:05:06] God okay now back to forn knowledge he
[1:05:08] can use for knowledge any way you want
[1:05:10] he's talking about eternal things and
[1:05:11] using for
[1:05:13] knowledge because it's no problem with
[1:05:15] him no problem with me because I
[1:05:18] understand what he's talking
[1:05:21] about so you see if you were in the forn
[1:05:23] knowledge of God then you are becoming a
[1:05:26] part of
[1:05:29] God see drop to Earth for knowledge
[1:05:32] you're now what becoming a part of God
[1:05:34] but he just got to explaining that you
[1:05:36] were already a part of God what is he
[1:05:38] talking
[1:05:40] about us realizing here who we
[1:05:46] are us coming to an understanding of who
[1:05:49] we are
[1:05:52] right we're not children of Jesus that
[1:05:55] that was a Son of
[1:06:01] God we're God's
[1:06:06] Offspring we had to have it by the new
[1:06:11] birth but that new birth makes us
[1:06:14] Eternal look what he has to say about us
[1:06:17] the only way you can be a Son of God or
[1:06:19] a daughter of God you had to be part of
[1:06:20] God and God isn't complete without you I
[1:06:24] love that statement
[1:06:27] right has to be that's right because
[1:06:30] there's only one only one resource of
[1:06:32] eternal life and that is God and him
[1:06:34] alone has eternal life now and you were
[1:06:38] a part of him in so much that you're an
[1:06:42] attribute or in his thinking in the
[1:06:45] beginning and that because he thought of
[1:06:48] you in the beginning it gives that
[1:06:50] little
[1:06:52] tug towards him I get back to that I've
[1:06:56] got some quotes laying over to the side
[1:06:59] how that brother R talks about you know
[1:07:01] how that you uh said don't you some
[1:07:04] don't you remember that that when all
[1:07:06] the other kids was out running and
[1:07:07] scrumping and and doing things wrong and
[1:07:10] said you
[1:07:12] uh you felt bad and didn't do
[1:07:18] it little tug I have no problems with
[1:07:21] that it's just a long ways down the
[1:07:24] road of
[1:07:26] course of course that's where people
[1:07:28] they think you get exalted and I've told
[1:07:30] you how many times have I made this
[1:07:32] statement that even when I was a
[1:07:35] sinner I would go do wrong and go home
[1:07:37] and feel dirty and
[1:07:41] repent cuz you see I met God when I was
[1:07:43] 11 years old but not as a new
[1:07:46] birth how many times have you heard that
[1:07:50] that's not garbage or not talking that's
[1:07:52] fact it's not tonight to be told you
[1:07:55] this church has heard it for 40 years
[1:07:59] right it's not a new
[1:08:02] thought don't make nothing out of me
[1:08:05] make something out of him all right in
[1:08:08] so much that you're an attribute in his
[1:08:10] thinking in the beginning and that
[1:08:11] because he thought of you in the
[1:08:12] beginning it gives that little tug
[1:08:14] towards
[1:08:15] him because if he thought of you in the
[1:08:17] beginning now we're going to get down to
[1:08:19] where that brother brandom says it like
[1:08:23] this he says
[1:08:27] what kept you from being killed
[1:08:29] well it looks like you're getting
[1:08:31] somewhere back into something that
[1:08:33] bothering me well I hope it bothers you
[1:08:35] enough for you to
[1:08:42] pray eternal life is eternal
[1:08:48] life little tug toward you that's what
[1:08:50] makes it to be quick that's what has to
[1:08:53] be quickened some of them will never be
[1:08:55] be quickened they just don't have it
[1:08:58] that's
[1:09:00] all now did he choose some to be
[1:09:04] this and others to be something
[1:09:09] else
[1:09:13] no but if he had children go ahead to
[1:09:17] the
[1:09:20] next all right this
[1:09:23] one yeah
[1:09:26] let's see I had to put an A in there
[1:09:30] sorry about that I have to add in things
[1:09:33] once in a while you know shoot one in
[1:09:34] when I get here this is 13A
[1:09:39] 1965 11:26 Works say faith expressed the
[1:09:43] spirit can come down here and anoint you
[1:09:45] to do certain things and you do it but
[1:09:48] that don't mean you're saved think of it
[1:09:50] Kus
[1:09:51] prophesied Judas cast out Devils see the
[1:09:54] spirit anointed him the rainfalls on the
[1:09:56] just and the unjust the Wheats can
[1:09:57] Rejoice with the wheat but it's what it
[1:10:00] is at the
[1:10:03] core okay read on in between there and
[1:10:06] see what he's talking about the spirit
[1:10:08] can be there the real genuine Spirit the
[1:10:10] Holy Spirit can anoint you that still
[1:10:12] don't mean you're
[1:10:16] saved it's that inside Soul That Never
[1:10:21] Dies it's got eternal life it always was
[1:10:24] eternal life
[1:10:26] it come from God it goes to God it's the
[1:10:30] soul I believe in an eternal
[1:10:33] soul but only one Eternal
[1:10:38] Soul that's the soul of
[1:10:41] God that's why Genesis 1:26 and 27
[1:10:44] brother BR said he made
[1:10:49] man m n not a
[1:10:52] man he didn't just make one part he made
[1:10:55] a theophany he
[1:10:58] said I believe you Soldier theophany
[1:11:00] that's another message go ahead to the
[1:11:03] next we'll get to that point about the
[1:11:05] soul and then you'll
[1:11:07] see I believe that his soul comes into
[1:11:10] you by the new
[1:11:13] birth that's what gives you eternal life
[1:11:15] me eternal life is when his soul comes
[1:11:17] into US amen right now things that are
[1:11:22] to be
[1:11:23] 65 the of your life spiritual life
[1:11:27] tonight now he's talking about Jean Jean
[1:11:30] remember the little story a while ago
[1:11:33] Jean when you was in your granddaddy you
[1:11:37] was a
[1:11:38] jean when you come into your daddy you
[1:11:41] were still a
[1:11:43] gene physically speaking until Mama and
[1:11:47] Daddy got together and it turned from
[1:11:50] that to a sperm or
[1:11:52] germ and then your physical body could
[1:11:56] come so remember what he's talking about
[1:11:58] the gene of your life spiritual life
[1:12:00] tonight was in God the Father before
[1:12:02] there was even a molecule see and you
[1:12:04] are nothing but the manifestation of the
[1:12:07] gene of life that was in God as a Son of
[1:12:10] God now you're expressed
[1:12:14] after his word has come in you to light
[1:12:17] up this age after his word has come in
[1:12:20] you after you are expressing God's life
[1:12:23] in you because you are a son or a
[1:12:25] daughter of God therefore you get what I
[1:12:27] mean r it up God knew that you would be
[1:12:31] here because you have to be one of his
[1:12:33] genes or his attributes you had to be if
[1:12:37] you ever if you've got eternal life then
[1:12:41] it always was eternal life and God
[1:12:44] before there was a foundation of the
[1:12:45] world knew that you would be here and
[1:12:48] when the word are the water the washing
[1:12:50] of the water of the word fell upon you
[1:12:53] you it was expressed in a being
[1:12:56] this
[1:12:57] one come on now you have fellowship with
[1:13:00] your father just because you have just
[1:13:04] just as you have with your Earthly
[1:13:06] father to Fellowship okay come on let's
[1:13:11] go now we're back
[1:13:15] to 15 which is Serv as we would see
[1:13:18] Jesus and
[1:13:19] 64 now you were in his thinking at the
[1:13:23] beginning if you got eternal life life
[1:13:25] there is only one form of eternal life
[1:13:27] eternal life had no beginning it has no
[1:13:29] ending so if you have eternal life you
[1:13:31] were an attribute of God's thinking
[1:13:33] before there was anything but
[1:13:37] him if you have eternal
[1:13:40] life you always was eternal what the
[1:13:43] eternal life that you have and you
[1:13:45] always existed with
[1:13:47] him what not his
[1:13:49] peoples as
[1:13:53] attributes come on if you lost the whole
[1:13:55] message tonight
[1:13:58] attributes we were in his
[1:14:02] thoughts you in God's thinking before
[1:14:04] there's anything but him your form your
[1:14:07] shape and what you are now is just a
[1:14:10] negative it's just a negative part of
[1:14:13] life go ahead to the
[1:14:15] next God's power of
[1:14:18] transformation Sons and Daughters of God
[1:14:20] was in God at the beginning now look
[1:14:23] you've got eternal life you say well we
[1:14:26] believe it that we got eternal life well
[1:14:28] there is only one form of eternal life
[1:14:30] and that's
[1:14:31] God's that's
[1:14:33] God that's the only thing that is now
[1:14:35] that's how easy it is to change what
[1:14:37] brother around
[1:14:38] says you say there is only one form of
[1:14:41] eternal life and that's God's so you put
[1:14:44] it no no and there is only one form of
[1:14:46] Eternal that's
[1:14:48] God entirely difference in what you're
[1:14:51] saying come on that's the only thing
[1:14:55] thing that is eternal is God and if you
[1:14:57] got eternal life that life that's in you
[1:15:00] always was if you got eternal life and
[1:15:03] you were in the loins of God before
[1:15:05] there even was a
[1:15:08] world all right you died with him etc
[1:15:12] etc now you can fellowship with him you
[1:15:14] couldn't back there because you were
[1:15:16] just a word in him a
[1:15:19] seed we'll get to that Jesus Christ was
[1:15:23] God himself manifested because he was
[1:15:25] the son because he was begotten but it
[1:15:27] was just a tabernacle for him to live in
[1:15:29] no man has seen God at any time but the
[1:15:31] only begotten of the father has declared
[1:15:33] him go to the
[1:15:36] next identifications of Christ in all
[1:15:39] ages may I break it down in the
[1:15:42] beginning it was eternal it wasn't even
[1:15:44] God our God our English word God is a is
[1:15:48] an object of worship but he there wasn't
[1:15:52] nothing to worship him he was just the
[1:15:53] eternal
[1:15:56] now would you remember this
[1:15:59] point he was not God until he created
[1:16:03] the Angels
[1:16:06] right so then his word God was not there
[1:16:10] just or back in
[1:16:13] there it was not made manifest until the
[1:16:16] Angels worshiped him so don't put us
[1:16:18] back there or something running around
[1:16:20] worshiping you got to come this way
[1:16:23] before you can start to worship form of
[1:16:26] morning Stars sang
[1:16:28] together in him was attributes anyone
[1:16:30] knows what an attribute is in other
[1:16:32] words in him was his thoughts just
[1:16:34] thoughts that's his
[1:16:36] attribute then his word and a thought
[1:16:39] expressed is a word in the beginning was
[1:16:41] a word before it wasn't even expressed
[1:16:44] it was a thought attributes in this
[1:16:47] thinking he was to be God probably C
[1:16:50] what's in this thinking he was to be God
[1:16:52] probably created the Angels first and he
[1:16:55] was
[1:16:56] worshiped he was God and then in him was
[1:16:59] attributes to be father to be son to be
[1:17:02] savior nothing lost something had to be
[1:17:04] lost so there had to be a way made for
[1:17:07] that to be healer nothing sick so he had
[1:17:11] so he had something that to get sick so
[1:17:14] he could heal it it's only displaying
[1:17:17] his
[1:17:18] attributes right come on okay what's the
[1:17:22] next the invisible Union of the BR of
[1:17:24] Jesus Christ 1965 11:25 he was only the
[1:17:28] manifestation of the attributes of God
[1:17:30] for he was the son of
[1:17:33] God any problem with that he was called
[1:17:36] a son but he was God
[1:17:39] himself he was the attributes of God and
[1:17:42] any son is the attributes of his father
[1:17:45] and just as you were in the genes of
[1:17:47] your father in the body of your father
[1:17:50] when you was a young boy you were in him
[1:17:52] yet he could not have Fellowship ship
[1:17:55] with you because he didn't know you but
[1:17:57] then through the bedding ground of a
[1:17:59] mother you were brought forth into the
[1:18:01] Earth and become in the image of your
[1:18:04] father then he could fellowship with you
[1:18:06] and so were you sons of God sons of God
[1:18:11] and Daughters of God before there even
[1:18:13] was a Moon Star or molecu you were Sons
[1:18:17] and Daughters of God no problem with
[1:18:20] that is
[1:18:23] it Four Angels come into
[1:18:27] being the eternal life that you have
[1:18:30] already was in
[1:18:32] being
[1:18:34] okay so you're Sons and Daughters of God
[1:18:37] even before there's moon or Star you're
[1:18:39] only the physical manifestation of the
[1:18:41] attributes that was in God at the
[1:18:42] beginning for there's only one form of
[1:18:44] eternal life and that was you before you
[1:18:47] don't know nothing about it neither did
[1:18:49] you know when you were in your fa
[1:18:51] Earthly father but you are manifested to
[1:18:54] In His Image in the image of God you are
[1:18:57] made and you were manifested for the
[1:19:00] glory and the fellow and The Fellowship
[1:19:03] Of God therefore as sure as your Gene
[1:19:06] had to be in your father before your
[1:19:09] natural birth your spiritual Gene had to
[1:19:11] be in God because you're an expression
[1:19:13] of the attributes of his think
[1:19:15] attributes of his thoughts before the
[1:19:18] foundation of the world we're just
[1:19:19] displaying it going let's catch the next
[1:19:21] couple we'll be through
[1:19:25] now look what he says but I want you to
[1:19:27] get this what does imorphia
[1:19:31] mean God changes his form
[1:19:35] right God changes his
[1:19:38] form now Satan is not an imorphia of God
[1:19:44] right you know what I mean Judas Etc
[1:19:47] people of the Lost cannot be imorph IM
[1:19:50] morphe means god changed his form
[1:19:55] so the very God in the beginning changed
[1:19:58] his form and started
[1:20:01] condescending to bring you and I into
[1:20:04] manifestation upon the
[1:20:08] Earth that was his
[1:20:10] purpose and Joel 280 promised that in
[1:20:14] this last days there would be a latter
[1:20:15] of rain poured out upon the people in
[1:20:17] the last days I think the Greek word
[1:20:18] there is kyos which means that he
[1:20:20] emptied himself out not in the way that
[1:20:22] we would say like something was inside
[1:20:24] of somebody that he emptied out but he
[1:20:26] poured himself out he changed his imorph
[1:20:30] he changed from what he was to what he
[1:20:32] is he never changes his nature but on
[1:20:35] the day of Pentecost he changed himself
[1:20:38] from being the son of man to the Son of
[1:20:41] God he came not with the people he came
[1:20:45] in the
[1:20:48] people come
[1:20:50] on he came into people where I
[1:20:55] he changed his form he came not with the
[1:20:57] people he came in the people see the
[1:21:00] same God to carry his ministry on
[1:21:02] through in this great age the same God
[1:21:06] imorph into you and
[1:21:11] I it just changed his
[1:21:14] form we're not a son of God in the bases
[1:21:17] of a son like our word son means
[1:21:19] beginning we are God made manifest by
[1:21:23] the new birth
[1:21:27] God in
[1:21:28] morphe get the last
[1:21:31] one who is this mes
[1:21:33] it he said it's been hid notice like the
[1:21:37] scripture he hides with a mask over it
[1:21:40] that's what God has done to this age now
[1:21:43] watch here we are it's been hid all
[1:21:46] these things has been hid and it's
[1:21:48] supposed to be revealed in this age now
[1:21:50] the Bible says they will be revealed in
[1:21:53] the latter times it's like a sculpture
[1:21:55] keeping his piece of work all covered
[1:21:57] over until the time he takes the mask
[1:21:59] off of it and there it is and that's
[1:22:03] what the bi the Bible has been it has
[1:22:05] been a work of God that's been covered
[1:22:08] up and it's been hid since the
[1:22:10] foundation of the
[1:22:11] world it's seven and it's Sevenfold
[1:22:15] mystery and God promised in this day at
[1:22:18] the age of this lady of in church he
[1:22:21] would take the mask off the whole thing
[1:22:23] and we could see it what a glorious
[1:22:26] thing God in
[1:22:28] morphe mask in the pillar of
[1:22:32] fire god in morphe in a man called
[1:22:36] Jesus God in morphe in his church God
[1:22:40] above us God With Us and God in us the
[1:22:43] condescending of God Amen it's not you
[1:22:46] and I
[1:22:48] folks it's
[1:22:51] God you said well you're just making too
[1:22:53] much of us you making too much of
[1:22:55] us where have I made anything I just
[1:22:58] read what the prophet
[1:23:00] said please explain to me where I've
[1:23:03] made anything other than what he
[1:23:08] said but yet see people they're not
[1:23:11] going to listen to you no matter what
[1:23:12] you say and and I'm not trying to
[1:23:14] convince anybody else I'm trying to
[1:23:16] convince you and
[1:23:17] I those that are on internet are only
[1:23:20] listening they are not this church they
[1:23:22] have an ability to listen they are
[1:23:24] somehow out there that call this their
[1:23:26] church and their tith here but if you
[1:23:29] don't send your tith here then you're
[1:23:30] not part of this church you're just
[1:23:32] listening so help
[1:23:34] yourself that's fine I don't want you
[1:23:39] money all I want to do is try to preach
[1:23:42] the truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:23:44] amen and if we walk alone we walk alone
[1:23:48] that's
[1:23:50] right that's no
[1:23:52] problem you see church I I believe not
[1:23:56] an eternal sunship but an eternal
[1:23:58] godship I believe God has manifested
[1:24:01] himself in his attributes I believe the
[1:24:03] eternal life that you have in you now by
[1:24:06] the new birth that you had to receive
[1:24:10] right always was eternal show me where
[1:24:13] the Prophet said you did not have to
[1:24:15] receive eternal
[1:24:19] life well what do you mean he he said
[1:24:21] you always was if you always was you
[1:24:24] have to
[1:24:25] receive now that's as carnal
[1:24:28] as anything could
[1:24:31] be that's PL dumb stupid and everything
[1:24:34] you could think
[1:24:39] of see you're just trying to use
[1:24:44] words I was trying to use
[1:24:46] words I quit that about 40 years ago and
[1:24:49] I've been trying to preach Jesus
[1:24:52] Christ I believe in Eternal
[1:24:55] God I believe it that God's children
[1:24:59] existed with him before the world ever
[1:25:03] begun before an angel or anything ever
[1:25:05] come into being God's children existed
[1:25:08] with
[1:25:10] him but only as his
[1:25:14] attributes not as people not as
[1:25:21] identities and may I say it again then
[1:25:25] did he choose for us to be his
[1:25:28] children you're going into
[1:25:31] predestination you're predetermining and
[1:25:33] leaving the others
[1:25:34] out or are we his
[1:25:40] children the eternal life that we have
[1:25:43] in us
[1:25:44] now is the only children I'm talking
[1:25:49] about and to do that we must have the
[1:25:52] new birth that's right
[1:25:55] yes because the only way you can have
[1:25:57] eternal life is through Jesus Christ
[1:26:00] am you say yeah but wait a minute
[1:26:02] Brother D we got you
[1:26:03] now okay have
[1:26:06] you the scripture we've read many times
[1:26:09] says that we were chosen in
[1:26:13] him I preached a message off of that
[1:26:16] remember and I asked you the question
[1:26:18] about being chosen in him I said which
[1:26:21] one is it
[1:26:25] were we chosen or were we chosen in him
[1:26:28] a lot of
[1:26:29] difference a lot of difference in being
[1:26:33] chosen many are called few are
[1:26:36] chosen there a lot of difference between
[1:26:38] being just a chosen as to being chosen
[1:26:41] in him I said then it's not concerned to
[1:26:44] me whether or not I'm
[1:26:48] chosen right it's whether or not he was
[1:26:51] chosen
[1:26:54] we know he was so it's no problem but
[1:26:57] you got the point he was chosen I was
[1:27:00] chosen in
[1:27:02] him in other words I have the same
[1:27:04] eternal life that he
[1:27:08] had he had to die to release that life
[1:27:10] could come back in you and
[1:27:13] I so we were chosen in
[1:27:18] him but when you start bringing him into
[1:27:21] being remember you already got the Book
[1:27:23] of Life dealing with
[1:27:28] it I hope you understand let's stand
[1:27:32] together I'm just trying my best to as
[1:27:35] brother B said not to call create a
[1:27:37] Doctrine but straighten out
[1:27:42] Doctrine and if I'm wrong i' I'd like to
[1:27:44] see it somewhere where it you know
[1:27:47] because all of the quotes that people
[1:27:48] are wanting to use I've used them
[1:27:51] tonight there's only two times in the
[1:27:54] prophet's message that he said you
[1:27:56] always was
[1:27:59] eternal I used one of them tonight I
[1:28:02] might have used both of them not going
[1:28:03] use
[1:28:06] one that's just like you hear all of
[1:28:08] these
[1:28:11] things you say well we had this seed
[1:28:13] laying dormant in
[1:28:15] us I want a quote for
[1:28:23] that but yet have to say brother Brown
[1:28:25] said it lay dormant in I want to quote
[1:28:27] for
[1:28:28] it you've heard it all your life right
[1:28:31] then it lay dormant I want a quote for
[1:28:33] it you got the computer go home and run
[1:28:38] dormant run dormant in your computer
[1:28:40] when you get home and see if brother
[1:28:42] randam ever
[1:28:44] said that we had a seed laying in us
[1:28:47] that was
[1:28:48] dormant he talks about the seed of the
[1:28:51] age he talks about the things of life is
[1:28:54] dormant because it had not come into
[1:28:57] manifestation but I want one where he
[1:28:59] says he laid in you as
[1:29:06] dormant see we quote things a lot of
[1:29:08] times thinking brother ROM said
[1:29:16] it and you better remember what we said
[1:29:18] to start with see the word dormant if
[1:29:20] you're going to use it it means lifeless
[1:29:25] if you got a seed laying in you
[1:29:29] lifeless and yet you still saying that
[1:29:31] you've got eternal life in your soul
[1:29:35] that en is not sensible to the human
[1:29:39] mind but yet it's preached as Revelation
[1:29:41] and people shout all over the
[1:29:47] house I'm
[1:29:49] sorry really I am sorry for not being
[1:29:52] able to go along with a lot of other
[1:29:55] people cuz I'm a human
[1:29:59] being but I want the people to have an
[1:30:01] opportunity to hear about Jesus Christ
[1:30:04] in the correct way whether you like me
[1:30:06] or
[1:30:09] not we get over on that other side there
[1:30:12] won't be no argument
[1:30:13] about them Egos and things we talked
[1:30:16] about the other
[1:30:19] day then it's like sister said the other
[1:30:21] day she said listen to somebody coming
[1:30:23] up preaching about predestination she
[1:30:25] said thank God for the truth well that's
[1:30:29] all I got to say thank God for the truth
[1:30:32] what do we got 392 in the red book 392
[1:30:37] in the red book anybody have a
[1:30:41] need Saints of th
[1:30:46] Proclaim Jesus the light of the
[1:30:51] world life and Mer Mercy in his name
[1:30:58] Jesus the light of the
[1:31:01] world we walk in the light
