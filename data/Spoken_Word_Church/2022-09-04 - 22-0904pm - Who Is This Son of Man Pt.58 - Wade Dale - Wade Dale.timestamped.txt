[8:19] amen something keeps holding me it's not
[8:23] me hanging on
[8:24] is him hanging on to me
[8:26] amen
[8:28] remember the old um
[8:30] used to see it on the walls a lot of
[8:32] times it was one set of footprints down
[8:34] the beach
[8:36] and the question was Lord why did you
[8:38] leave me in the time of my of my great
[8:40] need and he said they said no it's only
[8:43] one set of footprints he said well I was
[8:45] carrying you
[8:46] yep I was carrying you at that time son
[8:49] daughter I was one that was doing the
[8:51] work so if we let's let go and let God
[8:53] let him do the work
[8:55] then we'll be in a lot better shape good
[8:57] to be back in the house with the Lord
[8:58] good to have each and every one of you
[9:00] back with us remember the ones that are
[9:02] still traveling the ones that are sick

[9:14] um
[9:15] and she has it now so we're just going
[9:17] to pray she's on the backside of it I
[9:19] think so everything should be fine so
[9:20] just keep them in your prayers as the
[9:22] devil wants to destroy us but God said
[9:24] no not until I get done with you until
[9:26] I'm finished with him I'm not going to
[9:28] get you're not going to go any quicker
[9:30] than you
[9:31] supposed to
[9:33] amen
[9:34] you're going to go when God's finished
[9:35] with you and we want to go when God's
[9:37] finished with us amen don't want to hang
[9:39] around because remember what happened to
[9:41] Hezekiah God gave him 15 more years and
[9:43] he kind of messed up a little bit
[9:45] a man should have went on when God said
[9:46] in this time for you to leave

[11:21] every day we we try to uh I can't
[11:25] mention you all by names but sure we try
[11:27] to that was one thing uh brother Cauley
[11:29] always
[11:31] um

[11:39] requests now if you give me 15 prayer
[11:41] requests I'm going to say Lord Jesus I
[11:43] thank you for bringing these requests
[11:45] and I pray that you'll administer to
[11:47] each one of them and I'm you know I'm
[11:48] pretty much I can't brother Colin name
[11:50] every one of them what it was
[11:54] can you still do that
[11:55] probably not doubt it he said
[11:58] but but but when I first started coming
[12:00] back to church he was just it was just a
[12:02] mystery to me that he could remember all
[12:04] 15 or 20 prayer requests and he could
[12:05] name him everyone
[12:07] and I appreciate that amen it's lovely
[12:11] to have your name called
[12:12] amen especially a Christian man called
[12:14] your name Christian sister call your
[12:16] name so let's turn into Bibles let's get
[12:18] to uh first John but let me read the
[12:21] this quote right here in Christ The
[12:22] Mystery of God reveal we were talking
[12:24] this morning about Heavenly places oh
[12:26] how I wish I had time here I've got it
[12:28] marked right here in my Bible about
[12:30] Heavenly places what is Heavenly places
[12:33] Heavenly places just for a moment is the
[12:35] believer's position in Christ
[12:38] where the believer stands in Christ in
[12:41] Heavenly places so let's read Ephesians
[12:44] 2 Verse 6 and he hath raised us up all
[12:46] right now look where are we going we're
[12:48] going up the statue of perfect man so he
[12:50] has raised us up
[12:52] the believer's position there's a
[12:54] position we come to in here because
[12:57] we're going to look later on that inside
[12:58] even all this inside of all this there's
[13:01] positions that you come to
[13:03] okay and we know it's coming to adoption
[13:06] but we got to come to a place to where
[13:09] we write the check
[13:13] we write the check amen
[13:16] where the believer stands in Christ and
[13:19] have to raise us up together and made us
[13:21] sit together in Heavenly places in
[13:23] Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he
[13:25] might show the exceeding Riches of his
[13:27] grace and his kindness toward us through
[13:29] Christ Jesus let's bow our heads Lord
[13:32] thank you for the day that you give us
[13:35] we appreciate the group of people that
[13:37] you've
[13:38] assembled here today Lord that we can
[13:40] speak to Father the cream of the crop
[13:43] the greatest people that ever stood on
[13:45] the face of the Earth
[13:46] my many people would love to maybe meet
[13:49] a sports star or a or a movie star or a
[13:53] race car driver or something it would be
[13:55] really important for them to eat their
[13:58] picture thinking with them or or get a
[14:00] signed autograph of a baseball or
[14:02] something like that but Lord to stand in
[14:05] the presence of your children
[14:07] to stand in the presence of the cream of
[14:09] the crop the Hall of Famers
[14:12] this is it right here
[14:14] this is the one that's going to make it
[14:16] and father I pray that you'd help us a
[14:18] little bit more today to to gather
[14:20] ourselves together and be a little more
[14:23] a little more attentive to you and be
[14:25] Lord that we can climb up this statue of
[14:27] a perfect man together
[14:29] not leave anyone behind but reach back
[14:31] and grab somebody and not step over them
[14:33] and try to get as the world would say
[14:34] that they would burn Bridges let's not
[14:37] burn Bridges let's P let's pull people
[14:39] across and bring them with us Lord we
[14:42] pray that you just bless us now and take
[14:43] care of us in the furthermore this
[14:44] service in Jesus name we pray bless the
[14:46] ones that are sick and the ones that are
[14:48] traveling back and forth Lord many
[14:50] families are gone today we pray that you
[14:51] should be with them as they come back
[14:52] home and tomorrow also with labor day
[14:55] coming up we pray that you just keep us
[14:57] all safe on the highways in Jesus name
[14:59] we pray
[15:00] amen
[15:02] I believe that I believe I had rather I
[15:04] had rather
[15:05] sit with you guys
[15:10] sisters
[15:11] and brothers
[15:13] than to sit with any sports star and I
[15:15] like sports and I enjoy it that's okay
[15:17] if you enjoy it to a degree
[15:20] um
[15:20] you know we had a Archie Moore the boxer
[15:23] was here in the church for a little
[15:25] while Brother D Moore's Daddy and Daddy
[15:27] got an autographed fifty dollar bill not
[15:30] wanting a dollar it's a fifty dollar
[15:31] bill so he got an autograph but you know
[15:33] that's great but you know what I'd
[15:35] rather be sitting with some of you
[15:36] talking about you instead of talking
[15:38] about what he did 40 years ago in a
[15:40] fight
[15:41] or what somebody did you know 30 years
[15:44] ago there's a man in our community his
[15:46] name's Tyrus
[15:48] Brown well he was named after Tyrus Cobb
[15:50] Ty Cobb
[15:52] which was probably one of the greatest
[15:53] baseball players in the 20s and 30s well
[15:56] you know he's a nice guy to sit down and
[15:57] talk to because he's named after him and
[15:59] actually came to him so it was nice and
[16:01] he's in his 70s or close to 80. so he
[16:03] kind of remembered takov well I like to
[16:05] sit and listen to that but you know what
[16:06] if one of y'all walked in the room
[16:09] my attention would go to you
[16:12] because that's the word of God coming
[16:15] communion
[16:16] as we're talking today communion we are
[16:19] we're bringing together sitting in
[16:21] Heavenly places I'd rather talk about
[16:23] something heavily than talk about
[16:24] something Earthly had y'all not hey man
[16:26] I'd rather talk about something heavily
[16:27] than something that's down here it's
[16:30] okay to talk about stuff down here you
[16:32] understand we're human beings but if
[16:34] there's a choice that we have we should
[16:35] take the choice
[16:37] like the Bible says with the Lord's
[16:38] despised few which you know I'm
[16:40] following Jesus and I'm going through so
[16:42] let's read John 1. in the beginning
[16:44] what's the word where was with God and
[16:45] the Word was God
[16:46] and that word was made flesh and dwelt
[16:50] Among Us that is the son of man will we
[16:52] get to it that's what we're trying to
[16:53] build because look this stature of a
[16:55] perfect man is going to be
[16:59] manifested through your human flesh
[17:03] the stinking human flesh and the
[17:05] stinking thinking that your mom and
[17:06] daddy brought here contrary to God
[17:09] 's going to use that same flesh to
[17:11] manifest these virtues the only way for
[17:13] it to get out is to come through your
[17:16] flesh amen everybody all right with that
[17:18] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[17:20] among us and we beheld his glory the
[17:22] glory the only begotten of the father
[17:23] full of grace and truth he may be seated
[17:25] in the Lord as blessing to the reading
[17:26] of the word
[17:27] but think about that when you shake
[17:30] hands with somebody you're shaking hands
[17:32] with the Flesh of God
[17:35] everybody all right with that doesn't
[17:37] matter we're shaking hands with the
[17:39] Flesh of God
[17:41] so why would we want to when we get up
[17:43] here to the brotherly kindness why would
[17:45] we want to belittle people all the time
[17:46] why would we want to shun people all the
[17:48] time and we always you know as well as I
[17:50] do you look at each other and I think I
[17:52] said something to Sister Barbara the
[17:53] other day I said you didn't shake my
[17:54] hand
[17:55] well I mean you know we we're kidding
[17:58] when we say that but
[18:00] she didn't shave my hand
[18:03] but you see what I mean you try to shake
[18:06] everybody's hand you try to be where you
[18:08] don't shun people
[18:09] but it ain't gonna it ain't gonna always
[18:11] be that way
[18:12] but we really try to get around to make
[18:14] sure that everybody gets greeted and
[18:15] everybody else why some of you
[18:17] um if we have visitors you need to get
[18:19] yourself out there because I can't get
[18:20] out there too quick but you can get
[18:22] yourself out there and shake their hand
[18:23] and um tell them God bless you and good
[18:26] to have you here amen
[18:29] listen uh and and we'll talk about
[18:31] something like today but later on but we
[18:34] need if we we talk about doing stuff
[18:36] overseas and all which is wonderful and
[18:38] great and I appreciate it and I believe
[18:39] we should but we what brother Brown say
[18:41] the worst thing it needs to be
[18:44] um
[18:44] that needs to be evangelized
[18:49] your community
[18:51] your neighbor
[18:53] your wayward uh just like we were
[18:56] talking about going to Ohio and and
[18:58] really being an impression on the on uh
[19:01] brother Christian's mom and dad and on
[19:04] um sister Tabitha's mom and dad and
[19:08] to me that was worth it because they're
[19:10] still
[19:11] closer relationship
[19:13] um even brother Isaac I know he won't
[19:15] mind me saying that even him and sister
[19:17] Tabitha are all having a better
[19:19] relationship because they saw the love
[19:21] of God instead of somebody wanting to
[19:22] kick him in the teeth all the time hey
[19:24] man this is not a kick in the thief
[19:26] gospel we can do that from the pulpit
[19:28] for a little while
[19:29] but you do it with what you do it with
[19:31] softness and you try to do it with not
[19:33] so much
[19:35] um
[19:35] not so much beating the people up
[19:39] but where's our Outreach
[19:41] we talk about an Outreach where's our
[19:43] Outreach oh it's just us for no more
[19:45] well you know what if somebody hadn't
[19:46] said something to you you might be able
[19:48] to still been out there hey man
[19:51] so let's shake our neighbor's hand and
[19:52] say God bless you and we appreciate you
[19:54] like I said you all know who lives
[19:55] beside me I've got two gay guys lives
[19:57] beside me and I just didn't sit down
[19:59] talk to them and talk to anybody as far
[20:01] as worldly people not y'all but um
[20:04] why not say God bless you come to church
[20:06] what would you what would you do if two
[20:08] gay guys walked into this church
[20:10] huh
[20:13] no you're all gonna be going
[20:17] please do thank you that's what we
[20:19] should do
[20:20] we should show what
[20:22] I said the virtue of Jesus Christ the
[20:25] knowledge of Jesus Christ The Temperance
[20:27] of Jesus Christ
[20:30] first Thessalonians says look that every
[20:32] one of you should know how to possess
[20:33] when we get finished with this
[20:35] we should know how to possess our vessel
[20:38] and we got a lot of work to do all of us
[20:40] have work to do but we all want to pull
[20:43] together and get it done right we want
[20:44] to get this thing done to where we can
[20:46] have a uh we can have an Ephesian Church
[20:48] a powerful Church 12 people in the
[20:51] Church of Ephesus brother Brown said a
[20:53] powerful Church while they all had the
[20:54] Holy Ghost and they all were mature
[20:57] Christians he said and then and then
[20:59] brother Paul could come up and preach to
[21:01] him and he could preach about
[21:02] predestination he could preach about
[21:04] things that he couldn't preach to the
[21:05] current to the Corinthians all right
[21:07] Corinthians he was always correcting
[21:09] them about something first one thing and
[21:10] another because they just kept a bunch
[21:12] of heathens coming in but now they were
[21:13] they were coming into the gospel so Paul
[21:16] didn't kick him out he just had to smack
[21:19] them a little bit more than he did to
[21:20] Ephesians but the Ephesian church is
[21:21] what we're trying to get to where they
[21:23] were mature and we know what we're
[21:25] talking about the word of God Amen
[21:27] I hope that's your goal your goal I
[21:29] don't think is to get a star for being a
[21:31] church every Sunday
[21:34] that every one of you should know how to
[21:36] possess his vessel in sanctification and
[21:40] honor Romans 12 verse 2 says be not
[21:42] conformed to this world I keep reading
[21:44] this because we're going to get into
[21:46] some things that maybe is going to be
[21:48] contrary to the way you grew up
[21:52] these these virtues are totally contrary
[21:54] to the way you grew up
[21:56] anybody with me
[21:57] so it's going to take a renewing of your
[21:59] mind it's going to take you to listen
[22:00] how many people you listen to a sermon
[22:04] especially you listen to brother Branham
[22:05] and you you listen to a tape and you go
[22:07] man that guy can tell a story
[22:11] he could tell a story and you could be
[22:13] right you would be he'd be like he'd
[22:15] have you right in the middle of that
[22:16] story
[22:17] and he could tell that so simple but it
[22:19] was so profound that was a prophet
[22:21] talking to us breaking it down for us
[22:24] because look he had went back into the
[22:26] back part of God's mind he had went and
[22:28] got something but praise God he didn't
[22:30] lock it back up he opened it so we could
[22:32] get in it
[22:33] so it was a renewing of our mind through
[22:36] his mind
[22:37] that you may what proof so you're going
[22:39] to prove what is that good and
[22:41] acceptable and perfect
[22:43] will of God what is the will of God it's
[22:45] his word it's for his word to be made
[22:47] manifest in a group of people
[22:50] you can talk about viles plagues
[22:52] trumpets you can put Daniel 70 weeks
[22:55] together you can do all these things but
[22:56] it comes down to one thing and that's
[22:58] manifest in the word of God manifest in
[23:00] Christ amen
[23:02] all right second Peter one we read part
[23:05] of this but we're going to read this now
[23:06] and then we'll let brother random
[23:08] explain it in a minute now Peter is
[23:10] talking he's a servant an apostle of
[23:11] Jesus Christ to them that have obtained
[23:13] like Precious Faith so whatever the holy
[23:16] ghost that Peter had you and I supposed
[23:17] to have amen
[23:19] amen all right but now what Peter is
[23:21] talking to us now he's talking to us
[23:23] with the Holy Ghost with the virtues
[23:27] come on he already he had the virtues to
[23:29] be able to tell you what to do he had
[23:31] these virtues because remember we're
[23:33] supposed to come back to the faith of
[23:35] the fathers Peter was one of the fathers
[23:38] all right brother Brown was supposed to
[23:40] what turn us back to that to this right
[23:43] here and be able to preach in 1962 or
[23:46] whenever it was to preach the statue of
[23:48] a perfect man and him be standing in
[23:51] that stature and being able to and I'll
[23:54] read you a quote in a couple weeks maybe
[23:55] where he said Lord
[23:57] Build Me Up
[23:59] that I may teach Apostles prophets
[24:02] pastors teachers and evangelists so that
[24:04] we can all come to the unity of the
[24:05] faith not just one or two people
[24:07] all right to them that have obtained
[24:09] light precious Faith with us through the
[24:12] righteousness of God and our Savior
[24:13] Jesus Christ Grace and peace be
[24:14] multiplied unto you through the
[24:16] knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord
[24:18] according as his divine power hath given
[24:21] us all things that pertaining to life
[24:23] and godliness
[24:26] we're going to get a life lesson
[24:29] we're going to get a life lesson through
[24:30] this it's going to be life and what
[24:32] godliness
[24:34] what I tell you about getting the Holy
[24:36] Ghost if you get the Holy Ghost and you
[24:37] get these virtues working in your life
[24:39] you're not going to quit having problems
[24:41] but you're sure going to know how to
[24:42] deal with them you're sure going to know
[24:44] how to not you know what always told
[24:47] tell Jim when I get a little bit uh
[24:50] beside myself I go over in the corner
[24:52] and stick my thumb in my mouth and get
[24:53] in the fetal position and act like a kid
[24:54] all right well we don't want to be doing
[24:56] that we won't want to be babies we want
[24:58] to grow up right when God and I'll read
[25:00] you quote here in just a few minutes
[25:01] we'll talk about brother Brown he says
[25:03] When God says no
[25:05] what are you going to do in other words
[25:07] when God says uh
[25:09] what are you going to do
[25:11] if you're a mature Christian you'll know
[25:13] that's the best yes you ever got but as
[25:15] a baby you're still going to go what why
[25:17] why
[25:19] kids why why why daddy why don't why why
[25:23] why why and and with a lot of kids I
[25:26] said so will work but takes a lot of
[25:27] times brother John it I said so don't
[25:29] matter
[25:30] you got explained to him why are you
[25:31] going to do that all right we're about
[25:33] giving unto us exceeding great and
[25:35] precious promises that by these promises
[25:37] you might be partakers
[25:40] listen I don't want to be a partaker of
[25:42] my old nature
[25:44] do you I mean think with me today do you
[25:47] want to be a part of your old nature do
[25:50] you want that old nature to rise back up
[25:52] and you start doing the things you used
[25:53] to do
[25:54] oh my heavenly no I do not
[25:57] but I want this right here
[26:00] that you might be partakers of the
[26:02] divine nature
[26:04] the divine nature of God
[26:06] having escaped the corruption that is in
[26:08] the world
[26:09] through lust and then there's where we
[26:11] were we began
[26:13] several months ago with justification
[26:14] sanctification on to the baptism of Holy
[26:17] Ghost and that's the faith now at the
[26:19] bottom of the pyramid and I'll read you
[26:20] some quotes
[26:22] and I know that you and I do not have to
[26:25] be told
[26:27] that you got to have the new birth first
[26:29] all right because some people in the
[26:31] message think you've got to get all the
[26:33] way up there until you get the Holy
[26:34] Ghost where it says holy spirit now I
[26:36] don't there's no way you can get the
[26:38] faith of God
[26:40] without having gotten side of you
[26:42] because you're contrary to God until
[26:44] you're born again right
[26:46] so seeing that you purified your souls
[26:49] and obeying the truth so we've come to
[26:50] we've come to a base we've got our
[26:53] foundation our foundation is that we're
[26:55] born again
[26:56] are that we're not and let's start right
[26:58] here at justification and let's go to
[27:00] sanctification let's go to the baptism
[27:02] of the Holy Ghost all right because look
[27:04] the if these things are required
[27:07] God's made a way for you to get there
[27:09] but you got to go that way
[27:11] you can't go around that's right you got
[27:13] to go right exactly the way he said and
[27:15] thank God for sending a prophet that
[27:17] told us exactly how to do it
[27:21] seeing you have purified your souls and
[27:22] obeying the truth through the spirit
[27:24] under unfeigned love of the Brethren see
[27:26] that you love one another with a pure
[27:27] heart fervently being born again not of
[27:30] corruptable seed but of Incorruptible by
[27:32] the word of God which liveth and abideth
[27:35] forever
[27:37] now Paul's telling us he says all right
[27:38] come on we got to go
[27:41] therefore leaving the principles of the
[27:43] doctrine of Christ let us go on into
[27:44] Perfection not laying again the
[27:46] foundation of repentance from dead works
[27:48] and the faith toward god of the doctrine
[27:50] of baptism and laying on of hands and
[27:51] resurrection of the dead and of Eternal
[27:53] judgment see once you get and I know
[27:56] some of you got baptized over again
[27:57] which is fine that's okay I'll baptize
[28:00] as many times as you need to be baptized
[28:03] anybody's windows down
[28:07] I hope not
[28:09] you're going to get a car wash on the
[28:10] inside
[28:13] Anderson's heading down I just saw him
[28:16] run out and go down
[28:19] so what happens to other people too so
[28:21] yeah so see it happens it happens
[28:25] that's just the way it goes
[28:27] so the doctrine of baptism listen if you
[28:29] want to be baptized that's fine but
[28:30] there's a time when you got to be
[28:31] settled there was a time when you got to
[28:33] say this is it
[28:34] he got time when you say look this is
[28:36] I'm done I've done this enough enough
[28:38] times this is
[28:40] I think some
[28:42] I'm gonna say it anyway I think some
[28:44] people use water baptism as something to
[28:45] you know like well I'm going to get
[28:47] washed of everything and then I'll start
[28:49] over well that's fine
[28:52] to a degree
[28:53] but it's a soul washing not a flesh
[28:56] washing all right it's not a flesh it's
[28:59] not just you know you go down a wet set
[29:00] you go down to dry Center come up a wet
[29:02] Center no the Bible says repent
[29:05] all right so we got to repent first but
[29:07] now that we know that let's go on to
[29:09] something else of the doctrine of
[29:12] baptism of laying on our hands listen we
[29:14] all know how to baptize be baptized amen
[29:17] we know it's not father son Holy Ghost
[29:19] we know it's the Lord Jesus Christ well
[29:21] then we don't have to preach sermons on
[29:22] them now listen if there's new people
[29:23] come in absolutely we need to but to be
[29:26] a mature Christian we can't stay on that
[29:27] that's what Paul's saying do quit let's
[29:29] quit staying right here let's continue
[29:31] and Go on a little bit higher let's be
[29:33] like the Ephesians church when I say
[29:35] predestination
[29:36] that's not a bad word
[29:38] not to the Ephesians but now when
[29:40] brother Brown said it's a bad word used
[29:42] in a regular congregation because he's
[29:44] got some Corinthians setting in this
[29:45] congregation and some Ephesians that
[29:47] really wouldn't know what he's talking
[29:49] about but he's got some Corinthians in
[29:50] there some babies that don't know what
[29:52] predestination is
[29:54] because if it's top as you say
[29:56] predestined or predetermined Destiny
[29:58] it's then you don't have no choice
[30:02] but
[30:03] by foreknowledge
[30:05] then you put it right amen so if the
[30:08] doctrine of baptism laying on of hands
[30:10] resurrection of the Dead Eternal
[30:11] judgment
[30:12] we know that hell's not Eternal so we
[30:14] don't have to preach on hell not being
[30:16] eternal all right we know the
[30:18] resurrection of the Dead that we were
[30:19] talking about last night you're going to
[30:20] have a first resurrection now here with
[30:22] the dead Saints rest of the people are
[30:24] going to be dead for until the second
[30:25] Resurrection which is after the thousand
[30:27] years is over with so we don't have to
[30:29] preach
[30:30] we have Bible study on it yeah but we
[30:33] don't have to sit here every sermon and
[30:34] preach it because you know what it's not
[30:36] going to get boring but it's going to be
[30:38] like
[30:39] if you're a real child of God you'll be
[30:41] going come on
[30:42] give me some more I know that's right
[30:45] give me some more I know there's some
[30:48] more to get so give me some more
[30:51] same thing with this Tabernacle same way
[30:53] with the Old Testament listen the Old
[30:55] Testament was a type it spoke of what
[30:58] was coming that spoke of Jesus Christ
[31:00] that Ark and the difference that spoke
[31:02] of Jesus Christ and then when Jesus
[31:04] Christ was here he spoke to you
[31:09] spoke of me and you
[31:14] that's who he came for
[31:16] he came to show us how to live
[31:19] and he said I'll come back and go inside
[31:21] of you and I'll help you
[31:24] so there's the ark that's Jesus Christ
[31:26] we don't have to talk about it anymore
[31:28] let's continue on now we know
[31:31] and I like what Sister Christine said we
[31:33] were talking this morning after between
[31:35] Services you see that um
[31:38] the two tables of stone then you see
[31:41] that little basket of
[31:43] of
[31:44] Mana am I with me
[31:47] now for 40 years they wandered in the
[31:49] wilderness
[31:51] that was more important there couldn't
[31:53] have been no more in 40 pieces in there
[31:54] so I'm like I'm like her I believe it
[31:57] just multiplied itself as they went in
[31:58] there and started eating it then they'd
[32:00] hey
[32:02] he did it when he was on Earth
[32:05] he did it when it was on Earth he
[32:06] multiplied the bread when he was on
[32:08] Earth he might we might as well say he
[32:10] multiplied it spiritually right there to
[32:12] show that he was going to multiply it
[32:14] naturally and to show that you and I
[32:16] like brother Brown said he said that's
[32:18] the type of the Holy Ghost so you're not
[32:19] going to run out of it
[32:21] he's gonna keep getting more
[32:23] because Amanda was typing of the whole
[32:25] time of the Holy Ghost and then that Rod
[32:27] that stick is me and you
[32:28] but we know Jesus Christ had to come
[32:30] into Humanity first
[32:32] to die for us not first human being but
[32:35] first come into Humanity before he could
[32:38] die for us he couldn't die as the son of
[32:40] God
[32:41] he couldn't die as the Eternal God as
[32:43] the Jehovah he had to come down and come
[32:45] into human flesh and I was as I said
[32:47] last Sunday
[32:49] as soon as he decided that was what he's
[32:52] going to do when he come through that
[32:54] Matrix or would he come through that
[32:55] womb he was a human
[32:57] when that soul went inside of him it
[32:59] couldn't migrate over here somewhere
[33:00] else and do like it used to do it would
[33:02] appear and disappear it stayed in that
[33:04] body
[33:04] it stayed in that body so he could what
[33:06] be our brother but yet be God the
[33:09] fullness of the godhead bodily
[33:11] everything was inside of him amen
[33:14] but this thing the ark symbolizes the
[33:17] son of man because it's the human flesh
[33:19] part of God it's what that Ark was a
[33:22] symbol of and we know that it was
[33:24] overlaid which speaks of deity I'll get
[33:25] through this pretty quick
[33:27] you cover it overlay it with gold
[33:30] that's deity over the wood Christ over
[33:33] the church inside and out deity
[33:35] overlaid
[33:37] then he talks about the law speaking of
[33:39] judgment there the two tables of stone
[33:41] that was the law but between the law and
[33:43] the congregation there was something for
[33:44] deity stood in its place the type of
[33:47] Christ
[33:48] between the wrath of God and the
[33:49] judgment and Hell listen even in the Old
[33:53] Testament
[33:54] God allowed that blood of the animal
[34:00] to hide or cover sin
[34:03] until he could come in human flesh right
[34:07] amen sprinkle the blood so Christ
[34:09] standing in the way with an atonement
[34:11] made to save us from our sins and to
[34:14] heal us from our sickness deity stands
[34:16] in the way between judgment and then we
[34:20] looked at Aaron's Rod everything in it
[34:21] was restored again that's what we're
[34:23] looking for folks we're not looking for
[34:25] just a new birth
[34:27] wow
[34:28] potassium that's the most important
[34:30] thing because it puts you in line
[34:33] amen the new birth puts you in line to
[34:36] get these virtues the new birth puts you
[34:37] in the body heirs and Joint heirs but
[34:40] you I mean what are you going to know if
[34:42] you don't have a will it tells you well
[34:43] just show up brother John and we'll give
[34:45] you something
[34:46] no
[34:48] when you go there's usually a will that
[34:50] says this one gets this this one gets
[34:52] this that one gets this and I'm going to
[34:54] give this to this and I'm going to give
[34:55] this to charity it's all and that's what
[34:57] this right here was wrote 66 books of
[35:00] the Bible was our the will that was
[35:02] written this is what you're going to get
[35:04] hey man and that's why you can see
[35:06] yourself in there and that's the that's
[35:08] the family you're talking about Family
[35:09] Bible that is the Family Bible
[35:11] that's me and you that's our family like
[35:14] I said before somebody I'd love to talk
[35:15] to
[35:18] everything was restored that's the way a
[35:21] sinner is when he goes under the
[35:22] Shekinah Glory of the Holy Spirit the
[35:23] veil drops behind him
[35:25] have you ever really been there
[35:29] ask yourself that question
[35:31] have you ever really been behind the
[35:33] veil
[35:34] have you ever really been shut in with
[35:36] God in a secret place as the song says
[35:39] have you ever had that experience as I
[35:41] say brother Keith Reed says that
[35:42] experience
[35:44] have you ever had that experience with
[35:46] God
[35:47] you ask yourself that question
[35:50] the veil drops behind you what you're
[35:52] sealed
[35:54] you're sealed when that Veil drops
[35:56] you're sealed until the day of your
[35:57] Redemption but what you got to do is
[36:00] remember you got to come out of that
[36:01] Veil and so and go live it
[36:04] that's the hard part
[36:06] everything that you ought to have been a
[36:08] Son of God blooms out in him again then
[36:11] we talk about the fruits of the spirit
[36:12] and that's what we're going to do we're
[36:13] going to we're going to come out of the
[36:15] holy of holies we got born again right a
[36:17] born-again experience is the holy of
[36:19] holies
[36:20] right we're going to come out of that
[36:22] though like the priest came out and
[36:24] declare that their sins were forgiven in
[36:27] Israel for another year
[36:29] we're going to declare to the world that
[36:31] my sins have been forgiven forever
[36:34] not just for a year
[36:36] that was a substitute that was that was
[36:40] a type
[36:41] but when we walk out and we get free
[36:45] always somebody get free we get free and
[36:48] have freedom and we can tell the world
[36:52] fruits of the spirit love joy
[36:55] long-suffering goodness gentleness
[36:57] patience
[36:58] that's what we need to get in the third
[36:59] step get over into the Shekinah Glory
[37:01] where that little sacred light was
[37:03] hanging over The Mercy Seat
[37:06] brother Brown tells us again we're a
[37:08] stick of some kind and you were taken
[37:10] off the branch of humanity which was God
[37:12] created his son in the beginning listen
[37:14] everybody
[37:15] could partake of the tree of life if
[37:17] they wanted to
[37:18] amen everybody can we got to come boldly
[37:22] to the throne of grace we've got to come
[37:23] boldly to that tree and eat off of that
[37:25] tree all right everybody with me but
[37:27] some will and some won't some will like
[37:29] I said some will despise the cross some
[37:31] will come to it and some will take up
[37:33] their cross I hope you get that in your
[37:35] mind and I want you to know listen yeah
[37:39] we can read that thing called Pilgrim's
[37:42] Progress everybody read that
[37:44] you may and you get involved in that
[37:47] journey of that person you get involved
[37:48] right
[37:49] and you know the little things that
[37:51] happens in that story
[37:54] well what about you
[37:57] what about you
[37:59] what about your journey what about your
[38:01] story what about your moving through
[38:04] this way and moving through that way and
[38:05] God moving you over this way and showing
[38:08] up over here and
[38:12] right that's why you're written Epistles
[38:13] folks you're the book you're the book
[38:15] that's right you're writing it yourself
[38:17] you're writing your own script
[38:23] good or bad
[38:26] hey man you may be falling dead
[38:29] alienated from God but by that in
[38:31] creation you were created to be a Son of
[38:33] God so everyone has a chance to be a son
[38:36] and daughter of God
[38:37] we know that
[38:40] you may bounce around and be respected
[38:42] and honored out here in the courts but
[38:44] if you ever get into that glorious place
[38:45] and hide away with God you'll yield what
[38:47] you're supposed to do
[38:49] listen folks there's going to be like I
[38:51] said Wednesday night there's going to be
[38:52] billions that deny the cross billions
[38:56] there's going to be probably hundreds of
[38:59] millions that come to the cross
[39:01] but there's only going to be a few
[39:02] million that take up the cross
[39:05] amen so it gets narrower it gets smaller
[39:08] and smaller and smaller you know why
[39:10] it's the narrow way
[39:13] and few that be to find it
[39:16] notice every year the high priest
[39:17] entered into that place the congregation
[39:19] followed him up when he went into this
[39:21] great place the veil dropped the inner
[39:24] Court the holy of holies no one dared go
[39:25] in after him he was alone with God what
[39:28] a beautiful picture it is today of a
[39:29] consecrated life who once enters into
[39:31] Christ into with Christ dead to the
[39:34] things of the world hid away with God
[39:37] and the veil drops down around in all
[39:39] the worlds shut off
[39:42] we ought to do that here
[39:44] and I know it's humanly impossible
[39:48] I'm just going to be honest it's humanly
[39:50] impossible
[39:51] to just totally shut everything off
[39:52] you're going something's going to pop up
[39:54] in your head you got a doctor's
[39:55] appointment tomorrow we got to do this
[39:57] in the afternoon the cows need to be fed
[39:59] you know that cat that's got diarrhea
[40:00] he's got to go to the doctor
[40:02] okay
[40:04] I told him the story behind that is why
[40:06] I say it all the time because I had a I
[40:08] had a high school teacher that he would
[40:10] be out a good bit and he when he would
[40:12] be out he'd come back in and we'd say oh
[40:14] where you been you know so and so I'm
[40:16] gonna call him where you been he said
[40:19] well my cat had diarrhea
[40:21] so I mean that's all he said he could
[40:23] have been off you know somewhere else
[40:24] he's not my cat had diarrhea so I took a
[40:26] day off
[40:28] just another excuse that's why he's
[40:30] saying just another excuse just like I
[40:31] said this morning then Christianity and
[40:34] religion becomes a pleasure to every
[40:35] believer I want us to in this church to
[40:38] to let that be a goal of ours that when
[40:41] we go up that start as we go up that
[40:43] statue of perfect man all of us harness
[40:45] together
[40:46] pull it getting up that statue of
[40:49] perfect man it becomes a pleasure
[40:51] a pleasure to be here
[40:54] amen a pleasure to come here
[40:57] to every believer today people just have
[41:00] enough religion to make them miserable
[41:01] now like I said this morning I've seen
[41:03] those people have you not
[41:06] just makes them miserable
[41:08] well they ain't a full-blooded Christian
[41:11] there he might be in the journey
[41:13] but they ain't got a Shekinah Glory yet
[41:15] because when you meet God and you know
[41:18] that fires went inside of you you got to
[41:20] be a different person
[41:23] know that you ought to do this
[41:26] they're trying to escape hell
[41:28] well if that's the way I felt about it
[41:29] brother I don't know what I'd do
[41:33] now let's look at this full thing just
[41:34] for a second and then we'll get started
[41:36] where we left off this morning
[41:39] we know we've got to be born again
[41:41] before we can come into this pyramid or
[41:45] this teaching of the virtues everybody
[41:49] with me I've been over this for two
[41:50] months so you ought to understand that
[41:51] and this is the way it looks just like
[41:53] that but now what I have what we have we
[41:55] we covered it one time a long time ago
[41:57] what we're doing now though is we're
[41:59] doing what I said we've come out we went
[42:01] into the outer Court justification inner
[42:04] Court sanctification we went into the
[42:06] holy of holies we've got the new birth
[42:08] we met God now what we're doing is we're
[42:10] coming back out and we're going to
[42:12] manifest what we met in there
[42:15] right so we're going to come out and get
[42:18] back into that outer court again
[42:22] where it's not the justification that he
[42:24] chops off your past sins is where you're
[42:25] going to realize that the real you
[42:27] didn't do that
[42:31] right they're by with me
[42:33] a little higher up a little higher
[42:35] understanding of justification and then
[42:38] also as we continue on up now what's
[42:40] sanctification cleaned and set aside for
[42:43] service
[42:44] now the baby form Justice sanctification
[42:46] is all those unclean demons got driven
[42:49] out of your soul
[42:52] but not out of your memory reason
[42:54] conscious affection imagination I wished
[42:57] it was but God left that yeah
[43:02] God left that so Satan can still bombard
[43:05] you because you're living in this human
[43:06] world
[43:08] he left that there for what for you to
[43:10] overcome with you don't overcome with
[43:12] this
[43:14] you overcome you've already overcome in
[43:17] your soul you're already sitting in
[43:18] Heavenly places like we said last night
[43:19] if you're born again today your soul is
[43:22] in another dimension
[43:24] because it's Eternal it's in another
[43:25] place not in another place you
[43:27] understand what I mean but inside of you
[43:28] it's in a different area a different
[43:30] world Heavenly places I just read you
[43:32] the Bible
[43:33] that's the position you have but now
[43:35] still your memory reason conscious
[43:37] affection imagination it's where this
[43:40] virgin all this tempered faces godliness
[43:41] brother callous has got to be let out of
[43:47] yes goodbye with me okay
[43:50] I want to make it simple
[43:52] where we understand why we have to have
[43:55] these virtues it's because it's a
[43:57] requirement for us to get all the way up
[43:59] to that headstone or the son of man
[44:02] dispensation which that's what we're in
[44:04] now we just got to catch up to it
[44:07] everybody with me we got
[44:10] broccoli said amen now listen if a man
[44:12] that's been in this message for 50 years
[44:14] says amen and knows he needs to grow up
[44:16] a little bit more everybody in this
[44:18] building
[44:19] ought to say Amen
[44:20] right
[44:22] that's honesty though same with all of
[44:24] us
[44:25] we need to get to a place
[44:27] to where God can use us more I'd like
[44:29] for God to use me more listen the devil
[44:31] used me long enough
[44:33] the devil is did he leave oh he didn't
[44:36] y'all oh maybe only sister Alicia and me
[44:38] that's only two people well brother Boyd
[44:39] I think he raised his hand well praise
[44:41] God there's three of us that uh
[44:43] anywho
[44:45] we were the only three honest people in
[44:47] the building
[44:49] right
[44:51] because I want I'm long enough for him I
[44:54] won't do something for God
[44:57] and the only way to do it is is to have
[44:59] what the virtue of God the temperance of
[45:02] God listen I had the temperance of the
[45:04] devil long enough boy brother
[45:09] long enough I had enough of that yes
[45:14] patience godliness brother kindness
[45:16] we'll get to it all but see I've got it
[45:18] written out there to the side or brother
[45:20] Bob did this for me wonderfully where it
[45:22] says sanctification now look that's not
[45:24] driving the unclean Spirit out of your
[45:26] soul
[45:28] that's done finished sealed God's in
[45:31] there can't get in actually God can't
[45:34] get out
[45:36] he said
[45:38] he said he's going to come and be in you
[45:42] not in you and out of you
[45:44] he's going to be in you but that second
[45:46] realm or that Spirit realm is where God
[45:49] left that for us to overcome
[45:52] everybody with me
[45:54] we've already overcome in the soul
[45:56] because listen prove it brother wait all
[45:58] right you pass away today and you're
[46:00] born again your soul goes into another
[46:02] dimension
[46:03] immediately goes into the sixth
[46:05] dimension
[46:07] everything else stays out here the body
[46:10] you know stays here so then you still it
[46:13] didn't that you were you didn't acquire
[46:15] it as you went to get into that other
[46:17] dimension you got it already and it
[46:20] carries you into it carries your soul
[46:22] your very being into that other
[46:23] dimension
[46:25] and praise God
[46:27] that when we come back here and pick up
[46:29] if we have to pass away we come back
[46:31] here and pick up our human body that all
[46:34] the Bible says the former things will
[46:36] pass away behold all things have become
[46:38] new you won't remember listen the things
[46:41] that bothered you today
[46:43] they're not going to bother you
[46:48] let us not they're not
[46:51] the former things will pass away behold
[46:53] all things have become new
[46:55] you won't be thinking about all the
[46:56] fusses you had with your wife
[46:58] or your husband
[47:00] the trivials I was going to say stupid
[47:02] but the trivial things that you you you
[47:05] get mad at each other about and you're
[47:06] like man
[47:08] how many of y'all as you get older
[47:10] things don't bother you as much
[47:11] yeah I praise the Lord amen some of you
[47:13] don't hadn't raised your hand and I know
[47:15] why because it does
[47:16] stuff don't bother me no more it don't
[47:18] bother me
[47:20] no more than but boy I used to stay up
[47:22] at night and it just gnawed me not
[47:25] anymore babe
[47:26] sleep is much better
[47:33] but that to me though that
[47:34] sanctification that's getting that
[47:36] unclean that's not saying you're unclean
[47:39] but the spirits that bother you are
[47:41] unclean which what they influence you
[47:43] boy I like that that's new that's fresh
[47:45] I'm glad I got that one it's not you
[47:47] it's the what's influencing you now
[47:49] whether you say all right come on in
[47:52] I'll entertain that
[47:54] or you can say no you need to stay out
[47:57] there
[47:57] amen you need to stay out here
[48:00] resist the devil and he will what flee
[48:04] from you
[48:06] so there's sanctification the unclean
[48:09] Spirit going out
[48:12] and staying out
[48:14] we want them to stay out the problem is
[48:16] until we get to a real good case of
[48:18] being adopted son and daughter of God we
[48:21] open the door and let him back in
[48:24] sorry we do
[48:27] but I want us to realize that we can
[48:29] come to a place
[48:31] that we can be like Jesus that we can
[48:33] walk through a crowd and and somebody
[48:35] say
[48:37] that's a Christian
[48:39] and I want to just touch his a piece of
[48:41] his cloth of His Garment and I know I'll
[48:44] be made home
[48:46] Peter and then walk
[48:55] am I in the scripture people in their
[48:57] Shadow were healed what if they turned
[49:01] around brothers and preached the sermon
[49:02] to him and everybody starts screaming
[49:03] and shaking and praising God walking
[49:05] down the road and people just walk by
[49:07] and go whoop
[49:08] oh
[49:10] blinded eyes open cancer being done away
[49:13] with
[49:14] spy somebody walking by
[49:18] that's the way I want to be
[49:21] I won't be able to influence the world
[49:22] and they never even know I was there
[49:25] that's what I want
[49:27] right brother John I want to influence
[49:29] the world and not have to get this great
[49:30] big star listen we're going to get our
[49:32] Stars we're going to get our crowns it's
[49:33] going to be in another dimension
[49:36] and they'll be Eternal there'll not be
[49:37] something temporal
[49:39] but I want somebody to
[49:42] have an influence that's right
[49:44] like brother Ryan was talking about Mom
[49:46] and Dad having an influence on his on
[49:48] his marriage
[49:52] you notice he didn't say something y'all
[49:59] I wasn't looking at y'all so you can
[50:02] smack him if you want to see what I mean
[50:04] about that
[50:05] see I know I know
[50:07] but why but that's a virtue
[50:10] that strength was drawn from what them
[50:12] going hey we're better than the rest of
[50:14] y'all
[50:15] no it's just living alone
[50:17] living a life living a rock cow life
[50:19] living the best virtue knowledge tempers
[50:21] patience and godliness brother kindness
[50:23] that you know how to live
[50:25] and that sanctification yo hold hands
[50:27] now
[50:30] I'll get you when I get home
[50:37] I'm glad we can
[50:39] some people you can do that too
[50:41] but that sanctification that's the
[50:43] unclean Spirit the little things the
[50:45] little demons now that's going to be
[50:47] cast out
[50:48] right as we go up this statue of perfect
[50:50] man we're going to try all of us to have
[50:53] more virtue that's what I said when I
[50:55] mentioned it just a few minutes ago if
[50:57] you caught what I said I'd rather be
[50:59] around y'all than to be around somebody
[51:00] in the world in the world why
[51:03] I draw strength
[51:05] I draw virtue from you
[51:07] everything I mean we have even listen
[51:09] when me and Danny's not here today when
[51:11] me and brother Nancy okay
[51:14] he's sick okay but when me and brother
[51:16] Danny is together and even when we start
[51:18] talking about hunting and he likes guns
[51:20] and I like guns and we talk about that
[51:22] it's a kindred spirit that comes
[51:24] together
[51:25] we might not say the word name Jesus but
[51:27] there's a kindred spirit there that you
[51:30] can stand there and talk to somebody and
[51:32] feel comfortable with I want people to
[51:34] feel comfortable around me around you
[51:37] everybody feel comfortable not when you
[51:38] walk up to him like man I don't know if
[51:41] I should
[51:43] you know get over in the corner and do
[51:45] you know your Hail Marys and all that no
[51:48] I want to be comfortable around somebody
[51:51] I want it back like I said this morning
[51:55] but talk to God
[52:00] to God don't you want to talk to God and
[52:02] not bother you everybody you know you
[52:04] come in with your sin and you come into
[52:06] this load and you you come in like I
[52:08] don't want you to do that
[52:10] he said put your burdens on me and then
[52:12] let's talk about it put your burns on me
[52:14] and let's discuss this thing
[52:17] I'm not gonna kill you you're my child
[52:20] it our kids meant always going to try to
[52:22] kill him at one point in time but they
[52:24] all survived
[52:31] he leaves sanctification everybody with
[52:34] me so and then look we get up to the
[52:36] very top it says a special anointing
[52:37] well that is a special anointing that is
[52:39] the baptism of the Holy Ghost like
[52:41] brother Brown said and we'll read it
[52:42] where it seals everything together
[52:45] as a unit
[52:48] and you're grown up
[52:50] and then what can God do he can set that
[52:53] cap right there on top of you and then
[52:54] your words are as good as his words
[53:00] you don't have to pray
[53:04] didn't Jesus walk up one day and he
[53:06] walked up the Lazarus tomb and he said
[53:08] father I don't even need to pray but I'm
[53:09] going to pray because these people are
[53:11] here that way he said
[53:13] he said I'm going to pray because of
[53:14] them
[53:15] in other words he could have just walked
[53:17] up and said Elijah come on
[53:20] but because of them them what the
[53:23] unbelievers that were around him he said
[53:25] I'm going to pray to you father to show
[53:27] that I show obedience
[53:30] right but he was the father made
[53:31] manifest in another form called called
[53:33] Jesus Christ and who are we
[53:36] we're we're the bride in another form
[53:38] are called Jesus Christ we're the bride
[53:41] all right so that's what we're heading
[53:44] to so I'm just going to try to give you
[53:45] that a little bit and then we were
[53:47] talking about again this morning about
[53:48] the enemies of the Cross get to the
[53:49] cross and then carry your cross we're
[53:51] all going to have to carry across that
[53:53] maybe we have not ever carried before
[53:55] all right everybody prepared for that I
[53:58] think we are if you go to uh
[54:00] go to countdown and read Countdown the
[54:03] prophet of God says we're pressurized
[54:05] for this age
[54:07] we're pressurized for this age other
[54:11] Ages were not pressurized there's a lot
[54:13] of other ages I was watching an old
[54:16] movie it was a documentary do you know
[54:18] now you know we go what 30 000 feet in a
[54:21] regular jet when we go somewhere it's
[54:23] like 30 35 000 feet well they have to
[54:25] turn the oxygen on because of what the
[54:27] pressure's so they have to pressurize
[54:30] the cab or the cabin and then they have
[54:33] to put oxygen in there
[54:36] you know what they used to do back
[54:37] before they had all that they had an
[54:39] oxygen tank sitting down in the floor of
[54:41] the airplane there was a tube that run
[54:43] up and they put it in their mouth like
[54:44] there
[54:46] and they breathed the oxygen to keep
[54:47] from dying they'd pass out if they got
[54:49] so high and that was only like 20 000
[54:51] feet well where are we going now
[54:53] if if Elon Musk has anything to do with
[54:56] it we're going to be able to take a
[54:57] weekend trip to the moon
[55:00] drive up there and drive back
[55:03] listen it was unheard of in NASA unheard
[55:06] of in 1969 and 68 when they had the
[55:09] great Mercury rocket that took them to
[55:12] the Moon
[55:13] but they always had to replace it
[55:16] it always had to come apart it always
[55:18] had to had to destroy part of it right
[55:21] what did Elon Musk do he goes down he
[55:23] makes a rocket that goes out there and
[55:25] goes into the into the space and then
[55:26] comes back lands just like parking a car
[55:29] in a parking place
[55:31] look at that technology from just that
[55:33] period of time of 20 30 40 years well
[55:36] that's the same way we should be in the
[55:37] gospel we shouldn't be
[55:41] stuck in 1990.
[55:43] 80 2000.
[55:46] remember what I said when brother Brown
[55:48] was talking about the uh and I don't
[55:50] have the quote but I read it a couple
[55:51] weeks ago brother I'm talking about a
[55:53] fresh Revelation let the Manna fell
[55:55] every day and he said oh that's okay if
[55:58] you had your experience 20 years ago he
[55:59] said but now that's got wiggle tails in
[56:01] it
[56:02] wow you gotta have a new one you gotta
[56:05] have a new experience with God you can't
[56:07] take the old
[56:09] sure the old is something to build on
[56:11] that's what we're going to build on
[56:12] we're going to build the foundation on
[56:14] the foundation of the Apostle and the
[56:16] prophets Jesus Christ being the Chief
[56:18] Cornerstone
[56:20] yeah bye okay
[56:22] so the victim didn't carry the whole
[56:24] cross but only the Cross Beam thank God
[56:26] we just got to carry the beam
[56:28] hey man we don't have to care 400 pounds
[56:30] of cross We Carry the Cross Beam but we
[56:33] do got to carry this cross right here so
[56:35] the first beam would be Faith then the
[56:36] next beam is virtue the next beam is
[56:38] knowledge
[56:40] we got to carry that
[56:43] from any walk of whom I have told you
[56:44] often now even weeping
[56:48] Paul's weeping
[56:50] that there are enemies of the Cross of
[56:52] Christ
[56:54] whose end is destruction whose God is
[56:56] their belly and whose glory is in their
[56:57] shame who mine the Earthly things
[57:01] they they're written in a book but it's
[57:03] not the Book of Life
[57:06] they're never going to accept God
[57:09] Colossians 2 blotting out the
[57:11] handwriting of ordinances that was
[57:12] against us which was contrary to us and
[57:14] took it out of the way nailing it to his
[57:17] cross
[57:18] all right his cross
[57:20] now he's going to talk about our cross
[57:22] what we were talking about this morning
[57:24] for Christ sent not me to baptize but to
[57:26] preach the gospel not with wisdom of
[57:28] words lest across the Christ should be
[57:29] made of non-effect for the preaching of
[57:32] the Cross is to them that perish
[57:33] foolishness
[57:35] all right but unto us which are saved it
[57:37] is the power of God
[57:39] Matthew 10 37 he that loveth father a
[57:42] mother more than me is not worthy of me
[57:43] and he that loveth son or daughter more
[57:45] than me is not worthy of me and he that
[57:48] taketh not his cross and followeth after
[57:51] me he's not worthy of me follow after me
[57:54] so that means he's already made it
[57:57] we're following after him all right he's
[58:00] blazed the trail just like I said before
[58:01] many older ones brother they own
[58:03] different ones as blazed the trail so
[58:06] that it's easier for us to follow if we
[58:08] want to
[58:11] they found the quotes when we couldn't
[58:13] find the quote
[58:15] they had to find them like this
[58:19] right we just go like sister cleator was
[58:23] what we were looking for a quote last
[58:24] night she called me about uh a quote
[58:27] about Billy Paul and having a dream
[58:29] well
[58:30] I put in Billy Paul She said he said
[58:33] something about dark and dream so I put
[58:35] all that four in and there it was
[58:37] now to have to find that in a physical
[58:39] book
[58:40] uh it took days so they blazed the trail
[58:44] now that well we don't have to do that
[58:45] we've got the computers we've got the
[58:47] diff we got our watch we can get quotes
[58:49] on our watch
[58:51] there's no excuse
[58:53] more is given though more is required
[58:57] and when he shall call the people unto
[58:59] him with his disciples and he said what
[59:00] unto them whosoever will come after me
[59:02] let him deny himself we're going to have
[59:05] to deny a lot of self to get up this
[59:07] statue of a perfect man
[59:09] a lot of self
[59:12] but he said if you'll take up his take

[1:00:02] drops beat out when they could see their
[1:00:03] reflection almost like a mirror you
[1:00:05] could see your reflection in the gold
[1:00:07] all right that's what he's talking about
[1:00:08] if I do not the works of my father
[1:00:10] believe me not see if what is purpose to
[1:00:12] the church the life that was in Christ
[1:00:15] isn't reflecting in you don't you stand
[1:00:17] still if you haven't got patience virtue
[1:00:20] all these things and Temperance and
[1:00:21] things and godliness and brotherly
[1:00:22] kindness and all these things that's
[1:00:24] required of you

[1:00:55] excuse me
[1:00:57] preaching in the morning he must be
[1:00:59] preaching this one on Saturday night so
[1:01:00] he's preaching this on Sunday morning
[1:01:02] the full statue of a perfect man and
[1:01:04] draw it out in the Blackboard and show
[1:01:06] God's requirements
[1:01:09] and how we come to the perfect stature
[1:01:12] of a perfect man before God
[1:01:15] everybody with me
[1:01:17] all right here we go let's read this
[1:01:18] right here this is Brother random
[1:01:19] reading second Peter so now let us read
[1:01:22] I mean for second Peter first chapter
[1:01:24] portion of it Simon Peter servant and
[1:01:26] Apostle of Jesus Christ to them that
[1:01:28] have obtained like Precious Faith with
[1:01:30] us through the righteousness of God In
[1:01:31] Our Savior Jesus Christ
[1:01:33] I like the way that stated right there
[1:01:35] because my whole subject this morning is
[1:01:37] based on faith see let me read that
[1:01:40] again listen close Simon Peter a servant
[1:01:42] and Apostle of Jesus Christ to them that
[1:01:43] obtain
[1:01:44] obtained the light precious Faith
[1:01:46] through the righteousness of God and our
[1:01:49] Savior Jesus Christ notice he is saying
[1:01:52] that I have obtained this Faith am I and
[1:01:54] I am addressing this to them that has
[1:01:56] obtained like Precious faith
[1:01:59] now what is his light precious Faith the
[1:02:01] new birth yes what is your light
[1:02:03] precious Faith then you birth so you got
[1:02:05] to have the new birth first
[1:02:08] look it is not to the outside world
[1:02:12] this is to the church see those that are
[1:02:16] in Christ then he continues reading
[1:02:18] Grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[1:02:20] through the knowledge of God and through
[1:02:22] of Jesus Christ Our Lord according as
[1:02:24] his divine power has given unto us all
[1:02:26] things
[1:02:27] his divine power has now given unto us
[1:02:30] all things that pertain to life and
[1:02:32] godliness to the knowledge of him that
[1:02:33] has called us the glory and virtue
[1:02:35] whereby are we giving on given unto us
[1:02:37] exceeding great and precious promises
[1:02:39] that by these what these promises we
[1:02:42] might be partakers of the divine nature
[1:02:44] now listen if God makes a promise he's
[1:02:46] got to keep it
[1:02:48] so he promised to give you this divine
[1:02:50] nature and to give you these virtues he
[1:02:52] promised he would I mean it doesn't
[1:02:54] matter if you've got a fourth grade
[1:02:55] education or 14th grade education
[1:02:57] doesn't matter
[1:02:59] listen all our all our problem is is our
[1:03:02] yielding it's in our yielding yeah
[1:03:05] age doesn't matter
[1:03:07] intelligence doesn't matter
[1:03:10] it's how much we yield to God
[1:03:12] it's how much importance we put on this
[1:03:14] that or the other
[1:03:16] all right now let that soak real deep
[1:03:18] now not preaching this morning just
[1:03:20] teaching this lesson divine nature let
[1:03:22] me read that fourth verse again and I'll
[1:03:24] show you won't miss it whereby we are
[1:03:26] given we're by we are given unto us
[1:03:27] exceeding great and precious promises
[1:03:29] that by these these promises we might be
[1:03:31] partakers of the divine nature having
[1:03:34] escaped the corruption that is in the
[1:03:35] world through lust now brother Brown
[1:03:37] says see the world we've escaped that
[1:03:39] now he's addressing this to the church
[1:03:42] that's why we're here this morning watch
[1:03:44] is to find out what is the way what is
[1:03:48] God's requirement
[1:03:50] now if God requires it we got to do it
[1:03:52] but if God requires it he gives us a
[1:03:54] place to go to get it all right
[1:03:56] there's not a person in here that loves
[1:03:59] God but wants to become more like Christ
[1:04:01] why did you become a question a
[1:04:03] Christian to go by being like the world
[1:04:06] no you want something you want to have
[1:04:09] something at virtues in your life
[1:04:11] now that's laid out here every Christian
[1:04:16] all right the statue of perfect man
[1:04:18] 1962. that's the way it is with Christ
[1:04:20] see we've got to be so in love with him
[1:04:23] to when we ask for something here it is
[1:04:25] when we ask for something and he doesn't
[1:04:27] give it to us that doesn't shake us a
[1:04:31] bit
[1:04:33] not a bit
[1:04:36] see see why the only way you can do that
[1:04:39] is to become partakers of his divine
[1:04:41] nature then you'll understand the reason
[1:04:45] he can't give it to you
[1:04:48] you'll understand the reason
[1:04:50] that he can't give it to you
[1:04:53] and how's he going to give it to us
[1:04:56] Ephesians 4 11. and he gave some Prophet
[1:04:59] Apostles prophets evangelists pastors
[1:05:01] and teachers for the perfecting of the
[1:05:04] Saints
[1:05:05] for the work of the ministry for the
[1:05:07] edifying of the body of Christ
[1:05:10] till we all come
[1:05:12] all till we all come in the unity of the
[1:05:16] faith and of the knowledge of the Son of
[1:05:18] God unto a perfect man unto the measure
[1:05:22] of the stature or not statue
[1:05:25] stature of the fullness of Christ that
[1:05:28] we henceforth be no more children all
[1:05:31] right we're moving away from children
[1:05:33] we're moving away from the oxygen in our
[1:05:36] mouth to drive the airplane no we've
[1:05:38] come to a seven seven seven Hallelujah a
[1:05:42] 777 yet they may come now you know
[1:05:45] and that seven seven Jets got everything
[1:05:48] you need you don't have to put stick
[1:05:49] nothing in your mouth it's got you just
[1:05:51] turn a switch and there you got your you
[1:05:52] got your pressurized you've got
[1:05:54] everything you need and just fly the
[1:05:56] airplane that we henceforth be no more
[1:05:58] children
[1:05:59] have you ever watched the first airplane
[1:06:00] the Wright brothers they got a little
[1:06:02] film about it you've seen that thing
[1:06:03] that they flew
[1:06:04] they flew it like six feet off the
[1:06:06] ground for like 20 feet
[1:06:10] that was the first airplane
[1:06:12] now we can fire them off of a deck of a
[1:06:15] of a boat
[1:06:17] wow and run 1500 miles an hour
[1:06:21] and they were running about five
[1:06:24] best they could do they're peddling like
[1:06:26] crazy and got about that off the ground
[1:06:29] all right see what we've come to now are
[1:06:31] we still peddling in the gospel
[1:06:35] are we driving to 777
[1:06:38] it's your choice
[1:06:40] no more children tossed to and fro and
[1:06:42] carried away with every wind of Doctrine
[1:06:44] what by the slide of men
[1:06:47] preachers
[1:06:49] by the slot of men and cunning craft in
[1:06:51] this whereby they lie and wait to
[1:06:53] deceive they are going to try to deceive
[1:06:56] you
[1:06:57] but speaking the truth in love may grow
[1:07:00] up into him in all things which is the
[1:07:03] head even Christ from whom the whole
[1:07:05] body fitly joined together and look I
[1:07:08] like this word compacted
[1:07:10] I mean man when you pack it in there
[1:07:12] sister Freda when you pack it it's
[1:07:14] packed There's No Air
[1:07:16] there's no anything there's no there's
[1:07:18] no air bubbles pack it in there
[1:07:21] compacted by that which every joint
[1:07:24] supplies according to the effectual
[1:07:25] working as a measure of every part make
[1:07:27] its increase of what the body
[1:07:29] I'm not trying to get y'all
[1:07:32] built up individually just so you can be
[1:07:34] an individual built up
[1:07:37] anybody with me on that
[1:07:40] builds you up as an individual so that
[1:07:43] the group can come together and work as
[1:07:44] a unit
[1:07:46] a man workers are uni because that's
[1:07:48] what it says right here according to the
[1:07:49] effectual working and the measure of
[1:07:51] every part
[1:07:53] I am make his increase of the whole body
[1:07:57] unto the edifying of itself
[1:08:00] in love
[1:08:02] brother Brown tells us 1962 statute of
[1:08:05] perfect man I haven't read many quotes
[1:08:07] from the statue perfect man so I'm going
[1:08:08] to read a few this afternoon and then
[1:08:10] we'll go right into our communion
[1:08:11] well now that's the way it is trying to
[1:08:13] manufacture Christianity he's talking
[1:08:15] about a blackbird sticking peacock
[1:08:17] feathers into into it to look like a
[1:08:19] peacock
[1:08:20] the first thing you've got to do is be
[1:08:23] born again I don't know how in the world
[1:08:24] then people get that Doctrine if that's
[1:08:26] in the Statue of perfect man book write
[1:08:28] it the first paragraph 94. he comes out
[1:08:30] right out of the gate says you got to be
[1:08:32] born again
[1:08:34] you've got to be changed and when you're
[1:08:36] changed you become a new Cree creation
[1:08:38] creature now you're getting right now
[1:08:41] now you don't have to worry about the
[1:08:44] feathers it'll take care of itself when
[1:08:46] you're born again like I've said before
[1:08:48] you take a hog scrub him up put a tucked
[1:08:51] sailor suit on him or tuxedo suit rather
[1:08:53] on him and turn him out where is he
[1:08:56] going to go he's going to go right back
[1:08:57] to the mud he's going to mess that
[1:08:59] pretty old suit that you gave him why
[1:09:01] because he's still a pig
[1:09:05] because you see it wouldn't do any good
[1:09:07] he's a hog that's his nature wallowing
[1:09:09] is his nature that was our nature to
[1:09:11] wallow in the world
[1:09:13] you've got to change his nature
[1:09:15] and he the rest of it will take care of
[1:09:18] itself now notice you must be born again
[1:09:21] that is changed there's got to be a
[1:09:25] change he said well brother Branham I
[1:09:27] know this certain woman over here why
[1:09:29] she never did nothing wrong she's a good
[1:09:31] woman or this such and such a man he's a
[1:09:33] good man he never does anything you know
[1:09:35] he doesn't harm anybody that doesn't
[1:09:38] mean one thing
[1:09:40] he might make a good neighbor but if he
[1:09:42] isn't born a Christian until he's born
[1:09:44] again
[1:09:45] Jesus said accept the man be born again
[1:09:47] he cannot even see the kingdom now that
[1:09:49] means he means to understand
[1:09:51] all right now the statue of perfect man
[1:09:53] again
[1:09:54] paragraph 102 just right after that
[1:09:56] paragraph notice you must be born again
[1:09:58] and when you're born again you can't be
[1:10:01] born again without having faith see on
[1:10:03] my chart here I got the very Foundation
[1:10:05] faith is the foundation of all of it for
[1:10:08] without faith is impossible to please
[1:10:09] God he that cometh the God must believe
[1:10:11] that he is what that he is God and a
[1:10:14] rewarder of those that diligently seek
[1:10:16] him see he must be and when you're a
[1:10:18] skeptic of the Bible when you're skeptic
[1:10:21] of the word let me put this in when
[1:10:23] you're a skeptic of the message
[1:10:25] right
[1:10:26] being right you just might as well stay
[1:10:29] back until first you believe it
[1:10:31] what is sin unbelievable there's only
[1:10:33] two elements that controls the human
[1:10:35] being now here we go that's either what
[1:10:37] doubt
[1:10:39] or faith one or the other not both
[1:10:44] you're possessed of one that dominates
[1:10:47] your life just depends on how much Faith
[1:10:49] you have is how high
[1:10:51] you can rise but first you've got to
[1:10:53] hell it's got to be Faith let me stay on
[1:10:55] that foundation for a while that's why
[1:10:57] we've been on the foundation of faith
[1:10:59] for a while Faith Is What You Must
[1:11:02] Believe faith is the substance the thing
[1:11:04] hope for look you already have it when
[1:11:07] you have faith because it's revealed in
[1:11:09] faith faith is the substance that leans
[1:11:11] hope for the evidence what is it what
[1:11:13] kind of an Evidence a holy evidence
[1:11:16] a holy evidence that's what we've come
[1:11:19] into this we've come to a holy evidence
[1:11:21] we come to a time that when you get born
[1:11:22] again you go in the holy of holies you
[1:11:24] have an experience with God you walk out
[1:11:27] then you got to live it
[1:11:29] you walk out back out into the outer
[1:11:31] Court where there's the Gentiles again
[1:11:34] there's all the sacrifices there's all
[1:11:36] the things that are going on around you
[1:11:37] but remember that song shut in with God
[1:11:42] you can be in the middle of 10 million
[1:11:46] people and be shut in with God
[1:11:50] can you not
[1:11:52] I mean don't you feel alienated when you
[1:11:55] get around a group of people and they're
[1:11:56] you and they're all thinking different
[1:11:59] obviously they're talking different
[1:12:01] they look different they're acting
[1:12:03] different because they are different
[1:12:05] but you've been changing you're sitting
[1:12:07] there and then they're you know they're
[1:12:08] screaming about you know who's marrying
[1:12:10] this and in Hollywood and who's the new
[1:12:13] car that's coming out and all this if
[1:12:14] you've seen this at the uh
[1:12:18] um post office they always talk about
[1:12:20] some new uh series and they talk about
[1:12:23] it just like they're living in
[1:12:26] you know Yellowstone or something what
[1:12:28] something's going on now about something
[1:12:29] like that and then there what's Sally
[1:12:31] boys you see what she did the other day
[1:12:33] I mean they're wasting their time
[1:12:36] it's a fantasy
[1:12:39] That's what Satan wants to give you a
[1:12:41] fantasy something to what fantasize with
[1:12:44] that's why he give us Sports listen this
[1:12:47] nation we're concerned with sports
[1:12:51] and I used to be too concerned with it I
[1:12:54] mean people die for it
[1:12:57] I Wouldn't Die for one of them sorry
[1:12:58] millionaires
[1:13:01] if he got born again I probably would
[1:13:03] but he'd die for me too
[1:13:06] but you know what that's the world and
[1:13:07] it comes and it what it separates
[1:13:11] the whole world couldn't go behind the
[1:13:13] holy of holies there is a separation
[1:13:14] time
[1:13:16] like I was saying this morning with
[1:13:17] sister Gail you know she always said
[1:13:18] God's along his arm it arm is long it is
[1:13:21] but it's got a place where it ends
[1:13:24] 120 years his arm was long during Noah's
[1:13:27] time
[1:13:28] but at that end of that finger right
[1:13:30] there the end of that 120 years he said
[1:13:32] that's it
[1:13:33] I'm shutting the ark
[1:13:35] Noah I know you want to save everybody
[1:13:37] Noah we want everybody saved
[1:13:40] right
[1:13:42] but there's only going to be so many
[1:13:45] and we're not going to shut the door
[1:13:46] God's Gonna shut the door
[1:13:48] we're not going to end the Gentile
[1:13:50] dispensation God's going to end it
[1:13:52] God's one is going to do it sure we all
[1:13:54] got to come to our position our place
[1:13:56] amen amen amen but listen God's going to
[1:13:58] say how are we going to know it's a
[1:14:00] life's one
[1:14:02] what if the last one is in Africa or
[1:14:04] India or China or somewhere what if the
[1:14:07] last one comes in well we don't know
[1:14:08] that
[1:14:09] so God's going to shut the door but you
[1:14:11] know what we'll realize it
[1:14:13] because what
[1:14:14] we got the same spirit that person's got
[1:14:16] in in them him or her
[1:14:19] you know there is a last one
[1:14:22] there's always the last something you
[1:14:24] know the last there was the last one
[1:14:25] that's out there somewhere
[1:14:27] and he or she is just kind of walking
[1:14:29] around like this
[1:14:31] all of a sudden somebody's going to give
[1:14:34] them the message of the hour and they're
[1:14:35] going to accept it and then boom we're
[1:14:36] going to be gone
[1:14:39] God's arm is only going to be that long
[1:14:42] when the Gentile dispensation is over
[1:14:45] remember when the resurrection happens
[1:14:46] we were talking about it several weeks
[1:14:48] ago several months ago
[1:14:49] there's going to be 30 or 40 days we're
[1:14:51] going to still be hanging around here
[1:14:52] can't not one Gentile be saved during
[1:14:54] that time
[1:14:57] all your friends that's when the foolish
[1:14:58] virgin is going to come to us

[1:15:33] what I said before every disaster
[1:15:36] creates full churches
[1:15:39] because everybody gets a sense of
[1:15:42] religion
[1:15:43] and they gather in church
[1:15:45] and then when that when that goes away
[1:15:48] or
[1:15:49] ghost two three months down the road

[1:16:19] human being that's either doubt or faith
[1:16:21] one or the other even when you're born

[1:16:28] but you can't have fear like you had
[1:16:29] before or you need to get born again

[1:19:53] hold it come right here come right here
[1:19:56] I don't mind you standing here you're
[1:19:58] not going to desecrate anything grief
[1:20:01] um several weeks ago I got up here and I
[1:20:04] asked if anybody knew of anything that I
[1:20:07] had done said gossip whatever
[1:20:10] um to to please also begging you to come
[1:20:12] to me and two people came to me and I
[1:20:15] never you'll never know what that meant
[1:20:18] to me and the one thing I remembered I
[1:20:20] should have written it down I went and
[1:20:22] made right
[1:20:24] and it was wonderful and but I cannot
[1:20:27] think of what who the other person was
[1:20:29] so if if you are a person that came to
[1:20:31] me could you please just privately come
[1:20:33] to me again
[1:20:34] so that I can make whatever I need to
[1:20:36] right
[1:20:38] amen thank you everybody good with that
[1:20:43] if you're that one or whatever you need
[1:20:46] to just talk to her in private
[1:20:49] it feels good to repent
[1:20:53] he feels good to repent
[1:20:55] hey man I mean it'll lift the load off
[1:20:57] of you that the devil had he can't stand
[1:21:00] repentance
[1:21:02] he wants to pile it on top of everything
[1:21:04] you just say you know uh not this time
[1:21:07] I'm sorry brother Louise I shouldn't
[1:21:09] have said what I said I'm sorry I
[1:21:10] apologize and you know what he feels
[1:21:13] better and so do I because most of the
[1:21:14] time if somebody ever walks up to me and
[1:21:16] somebody walks up to me the other day
[1:21:17] and said I'm sorry for so-and-so and I'm
[1:21:19] like
[1:21:21] I don't remember what that was
[1:21:25] but it was important to them hey man as
[1:21:27] long as I got it off it was important to
[1:21:29] them but you get it off that's why we're
[1:21:31] taking communion that's why we commune
[1:21:33] with God that's why Paul was able to
[1:21:35] write to communion because he said I
[1:21:37] have received of the Lord he wasn't
[1:21:39] there
[1:21:40] and I like what a brother said he said
[1:21:42] now Matthew Martin Luke and John that's
[1:21:44] four different gospels right
[1:21:46] and remember there was in one gospel
[1:21:48] there was two Blind Men another gospel
[1:21:50] that was one blind man in another gospel
[1:21:52] that showed you this way in this way
[1:21:54] well God didn't want the communion table
[1:21:56] to be that way
[1:21:57] he wanted one man a prophet to tell you
[1:22:00] what happened in the upper room to make
[1:22:02] sure that we did it the right way that
[1:22:05] it wasn't two Blind Men or one blind man
[1:22:07] or was it cups or was it
[1:22:10] right you understand what I'm saying
[1:22:12] then he gave us a prophet to give us
[1:22:14] clarity
[1:22:15] in the end time I thank God
[1:22:17] that we're living in this time of
[1:22:19] Revelation
[1:22:21] they say what they want to about William
[1:22:22] Mary Brown I really don't care
[1:22:25] they gonna have to face God
[1:22:28] they're going to face God Amen I was
[1:22:31] reading the other day
[1:22:33] and brother Brandon was so he and he
[1:22:35] said thus saith the Lord so many times
[1:22:38] and and all this happens that they can't
[1:22:40] deny
[1:22:41] but they deny the little things the
[1:22:43] little something you know the 12 people
[1:22:44] that fell off the bridge and blah blah
[1:22:46] blah blah all that stuff
[1:22:48] he's a man that stood and said I'll take
[1:22:51] this
[1:22:53] to judgment
[1:22:55] I'll face this now my word
[1:22:58] he's gonna have to face it if he's not
[1:23:01] right but we know he was but they're
[1:23:03] gonna what they're saying is is he's all
[1:23:05] false bro John 1100 sermons and all the
[1:23:08] people that got healed he was false
[1:23:11] listen there's so much insurmountable
[1:23:14] evidence that he was the prophet of God
[1:23:16] that there is no way that a sane person
[1:23:20] would believe any other way they have
[1:23:23] just got a demon on them
[1:23:25] a line demon that's lying to them about
[1:23:28] everything that's been said against the
[1:23:30] prophet of God Amen so I just want to
[1:23:33] make sure this is for me
[1:23:35] this message is for me
[1:23:37] all right it's for me
[1:23:39] all right all right you got to say the
[1:23:41] same thing it's for you too and man it's
[1:23:43] for you this message is for each and
[1:23:45] every one of us
[1:23:46] but God ordained it to come through one
[1:23:50] man to give us not one opinion he gave
[1:23:54] us what God Said
[1:23:56] he didn't give us an opinion of a
[1:23:58] denominational church that backed him up
[1:24:00] that's why he didn't go to the
[1:24:01] nominations well I stood alone God
[1:24:04] wanted him to stand alone he didn't want
[1:24:06] to have to say well brother Brown you
[1:24:08] can't preach that in that church no he
[1:24:11] wouldn't preach what he preached what
[1:24:12] God told him to preach amen so let's
[1:24:14] read the scripture for I received of the
[1:24:17] Lord that which also I delivered unto
[1:24:18] you that the Lord Jesus the same night
[1:24:19] in which he was betrayed took bread and
[1:24:22] when he had given thanks he break and
[1:24:23] said take it this is my body which is
[1:24:25] broken for you and this is doing
[1:24:27] remembrance of me after the same manner
[1:24:29] also he took the cup and when he saying
[1:24:32] this cup is the New Testament in my
[1:24:34] blood this do you often as you drink it
[1:24:36] in remembrance of me everything is in
[1:24:39] remembrance of me
[1:24:41] not that we remembered that it was the
[1:24:43] first Sunday of every month no we
[1:24:45] remembered when we take this communion
[1:24:47] we're going to remember what he did
[1:24:48] all right in remembrance of me communion
[1:24:51] we're going to commune with God and say
[1:24:53] God thank you for doing what you did
[1:24:55] because I couldn't have done it you
[1:24:57] couldn't have done it no way you could
[1:24:58] have done what he did hanging on Calvary
[1:25:01] amen for as often as you eat this bread
[1:25:04] and drink this cup you do show the
[1:25:05] Lord's death until you till he comes
[1:25:07] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:25:09] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:25:10] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:25:13] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:25:15] examine himself sister Freda
[1:25:17] our sister examined himself
[1:25:20] examine see what's going on
[1:25:24] if you had to get something get out of
[1:25:25] the way get out of the way
[1:25:27] and and don't wait on the person you
[1:25:29] take communion today because you give
[1:25:31] everybody understand what I'm saying
[1:25:32] prophet of God said you might not can
[1:25:34] get to him right then but you better get
[1:25:36] to them when you get finished all right
[1:25:37] everybody with me so if you get if
[1:25:40] you're bothered by something take
[1:25:42] communion and then go make it right if
[1:25:44] that person's not around where you can
[1:25:45] you know where you can't do that
[1:25:49] but let a man examine himself and so let
[1:25:51] him eat of that bread and drink of that
[1:25:52] cup for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:25:54] unworldly eatest and drinketh Damnation
[1:25:56] to himself not discerning the Lord's
[1:25:58] body for this cause many are weak and
[1:26:00] sickly among you in many sleep
[1:26:02] for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:26:04] should not be judged but when we are
[1:26:05] judged we are chastened of the Lord that
[1:26:08] we should not be condemned with the
[1:26:11] world praise God
[1:26:12] wherefore my brethren when you come
[1:26:14] together to eat tarry one for another
[1:26:16] in other words stop for a minute
[1:26:19] do like sister freed it in check up the
[1:26:21] checking balances check the balance and
[1:26:23] make sure check it make sure
[1:26:24] everything's good everything's all right
[1:26:26] if you got a little something like I
[1:26:28] said something you know you say
[1:26:29] something to a co-worker make it right
[1:26:31] tomorrow take communion today it's not
[1:26:33] shouldn't stop you from taking communion
[1:26:36] all right but when we are judged we are
[1:26:38] chasing of the Lord that we should not
[1:26:39] be condemned with the world wherefore my
[1:26:41] brother when you come together to eat
[1:26:42] tarry one for another and if any man
[1:26:44] hunger let him eat at home that he come
[1:26:46] not together into condemnation and the
[1:26:48] rest will I send an order
[1:26:50] when I come so let's have a moment of
[1:26:53] Silent prayer
[1:26:54] brother Brown said pray for your pastor
[1:26:58] I say pray for all the heads of deacons
[1:27:01] Elders everybody that has anything to do
[1:27:03] with the church because Satan would love
[1:27:04] to just tear us apart
[1:27:06] Satan would love to tear all of us apart
[1:27:08] but let's have a moment of Silent prayer
[1:27:10] and then let's take communion let's
[1:27:11] commune with God
[1:27:23] we thank you Lord for all things you've
[1:27:25] given us father now we as we partake to
[1:27:27] this bread and this wine Lord may we
[1:27:29] remember that you hung on an old dirty
[1:27:32] cross you hung on two sticks
[1:27:34] Lord that we're stuck into the Earth and
[1:27:37] father you did it for me
[1:27:40] you did it for our brothers and sisters
[1:27:41] here's Lord
[1:27:42] I pray that you and you don't ever have
[1:27:45] to do that again you did it once for all
[1:27:46] but Lord let us take up our cross though
[1:27:49] let us take that Cross Beam and pick it
[1:27:50] up and put it on our shoulders the
[1:27:52] strongest part of our body and let us
[1:27:54] carry our cross and follow you Lord and
[1:27:57] may that cross be transferred into
[1:27:59] feathers Lord is what brother Brown said
[1:28:01] this morning as wings
[1:28:03] those two cross pieces will turn into
[1:28:06] wings and Lord we'll fly away out of
[1:28:08] here one day probably give us our daily
[1:28:09] bread the day in Jesus name amen the
[1:28:12] Bible said he took bread and he blessed
[1:28:14] it Lord Jesus thank you for this bread
[1:28:16] it has been made with holy hands it's
[1:28:18] been made according to the way you need
[1:28:19] it made Lord with no leaven where it
[1:28:22] won't rise lord it's not something for
[1:28:23] us to take pleasure in but it's your
[1:28:25] body that was broken Lord that was taken
[1:28:28] and put through the most horrible
[1:28:31] horrible situations you stood that for
[1:28:33] me and and our brothers and sisters here
[1:28:35] Lord now as we partake of this Lord may
[1:28:37] we remember you in Jesus name we pray
[1:28:40] amen
[1:28:42] and then what are we going to do with
[1:28:44] this when we get done I'm going to take
[1:28:45] it home and I'm going to burn it before
[1:28:47] the next day because we don't hold it
[1:28:49] over
[1:28:50] we're going to burn it Beyond
[1:28:53] where you'll never be able to eat it
[1:28:54] again
[1:28:55] because tomorrow we want a fresh
[1:28:57] revelation
[1:28:58] and man just like the Manta we want a
[1:28:59] fresh revelation we don't we don't want
[1:29:01] to stale bread of the day before
[1:29:05] amen
[1:29:07] and that's that's something to say if
[1:29:08] you know that quote for brother Brown
[1:29:09] said well yeah you had an experience 20
[1:29:11] years ago said but that's got wiggle
[1:29:13] tails in it now wow

[1:29:25] weeks I ain't been since but I'm saved
[1:29:28] I don't think so
[1:29:30] he might have come to the cross and got
[1:29:32] a good case of justification but thank
[1:29:35] God for a prophet that tells me that if
[1:29:37] I'm to that if I'm to think that I'm
[1:29:40] wrong
[1:29:41] hey man denominations can think that go
[1:29:44] out we're good like we're talking about
[1:29:46] last night you know everybody in the
[1:29:47] denominational World they think that

[1:33:04] they even asked it why does your master
[1:33:06] always eat with sinners
[1:33:09] and publicans
[1:33:11] you know why Jesus said because they
[1:33:13] needed saving
[1:33:14] amen you know what he was telling them
[1:33:17] you're not savable
[1:33:20] that's what he was telling the religious
[1:33:21] world you're not I didn't come to save
[1:33:23] you I come to save them
[1:33:25] amen
[1:33:26] what would it be
[1:33:28] if he acted so much like that
[1:33:31] Yeti was God Almighty and human flesh
[1:33:35] where the world looked at him and said
[1:33:37] you're Beelzebub you're the you're not
[1:33:40] the devil you're the prince of the
[1:33:41] Devils Belgium was the prince of demons
[1:33:43] not just demons he was the prince of
[1:33:45] demons
[1:33:48] he was the Apex of demons that's what
[1:33:50] they were calling Jesus
[1:33:51] was the Apex of being a demon
[1:34:02] thank you brother
[1:34:03] thank you brother
[1:34:18] let's remember him
[1:34:21] let's partake
[1:34:24] thank you Lord
[1:34:33] what a small symbol of what he'd done
[1:34:35] for us
[1:34:38] he was beat to a pulp
[1:34:41] for me and you
[1:34:43] he hung on the cross for hours
[1:34:46] Brother John
[1:34:48] he hung on the cross for hours just so
[1:34:50] that me and you
[1:34:52] can be saved
[1:34:54] he absolutely
[1:34:56] I get it I'll get he absolutely
[1:35:00] done something you and I would never do
[1:35:02] he didn't die for himself he died for me

[1:35:05] didn't die for herself
[1:35:08] he died alone the Bible says though
[1:35:11] song says he died alone for you and me
[1:35:15] it was not a lot of Glory going on
[1:35:18] at Calvary
[1:35:20] but it was the greatest moment
[1:35:22] that a man could do for someone else
[1:35:25] is to give his life not only that he
[1:35:28] could just give his life but he could
[1:35:30] come take that life and put it back
[1:35:31] inside of you
[1:35:33] because he had eternal life in his soul
[1:35:36] he wasn't just had eternal life brother
[1:35:38] Carly he was eternal life
[1:35:41] amen he was the man to give it to us he
[1:35:44] was our Boaz
[1:35:45] he was the one that gave us this gift
[1:35:48] now as we receive the new birth now

[1:35:53] promises

[1:36:00] you can't fail if you'll try if you'll
[1:36:02] give it to God all you got you cannot
[1:36:05] fail
[1:36:06] there's no way you can
[1:36:10] because somebody's going to fulfill all
[1:36:12] those scriptures that somebody made it
[1:36:15] hey man
[1:36:16] did somebody come to a place of adoption
[1:36:19] and then somebody come to a place of a
[1:36:21] body change
[1:36:22] and that body change has got to be not
[1:36:25] just a day on the calendar it's got to
[1:36:27] be when you and I come to a place to
[1:36:29] where death is destroyed and I can look
[1:36:32] at death and say uh
[1:36:36] no not me you go get somebody else but
[1:36:39] no not me brother Brian said death will
[1:36:41] call up your slave
[1:36:43] go up your sleeve and you'll just wipe
[1:36:46] it right off
[1:36:47] that's not
[1:36:48] a fantasy
[1:36:50] that will be a reality amen so let's
[1:36:53] read John chapter 13. and supper being
[1:36:56] ended the devil having now put in the
[1:36:57] heart of Judas is Carrot Simon's son to
[1:36:59] betray him Jesus knowing that the father
[1:37:01] had given all things into his hand and
[1:37:03] that he come from God and he went to God

[1:37:07] garments and took a towel and girded
[1:37:09] himself and after that he pours water
[1:37:11] into a basin and began to watch the

[1:37:55] Jesus answered if I wash thee not you're
[1:37:58] going to have no part with me
[1:38:00] wow
