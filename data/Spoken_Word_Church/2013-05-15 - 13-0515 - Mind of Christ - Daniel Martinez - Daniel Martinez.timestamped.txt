[6:45] mind let not let nothing be done through
[6:50] Strife or vainglory but but in the
[6:54] lowliness of mind let
[6:56] each esteem others better than
[6:59] themselves look not every man on his own
[7:03] things but every man also in
[7:08] on the things of others
[7:13] and let this mind be in you which is
[7:17] also in Christ Jesus who being in the
[7:22] form of God thought it not robbery to be
[7:25] equal with God but made himself to no
[7:29] rep of no reputation and took on took
[7:33] him on
[7:34] took upon himself
[7:36] took upon him the form of a servant and
[7:40] was made in the likeness of man being
[7:43] found being formed in this in fashion as
[7:47] a man he humbled himself and became
[7:50] obedient unto the death even the death
[7:53] of the cross
[7:55] where wherefore God also hath
[7:59] God also hath highly is
[8:02] exalted him and given him a name which
[8:07] is above every name that in the name of
[8:10] Jesus Christ every knee should bow and
[8:13] every of things in heaven and of things
[8:17] on in Earth things under the Earth and
[8:21] that every tongue should confess that
[8:23] Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God
[8:26] the Father
[8:27] amen
[8:29] and now let's turn over in another
[8:31] scripture to Hebrews
[8:33] 1
[8:35] and 1.
[8:38] and this is uh a familiar text for
[8:41] anybody that's in this message
[8:44] God who is inside God who at Sun Dry
[8:47] times and in diverse manners spoke in
[8:51] times past unto the fathers by the
[8:53] prophets hath in these last days spoken
[8:56] unto us by his son whom he hath
[9:00] appointed heir of All Things by whom
[9:03] also he made the worlds
[9:07] who being in the brightness of his glory
[9:11] and the excellent image of his person
[9:15] and
[9:16] upholding All Things by the word of his
[9:20] power
[9:21] then he had when when he had made by
[9:27] we had made by himself
[9:30] purged sins that down
[9:34] sat down on the right hand of the
[9:37] Majesty on high being made so much
[9:40] better than the angels as he hath
[9:44] by
[9:46] inheritance
[9:48] inheritance obedient
[9:51] a more excellent Name than they
[9:55] inheritance obtained a more excellent
[9:58] Name than they amen now let's go over to
[10:01] Saint John 1 and 1. this is very
[10:03] familiar
[10:10] in the beginning was the word
[10:13] and the in the beginning was the word
[10:18] and the Word was with God and the Word
[10:21] was gone and the same was in the
[10:24] beginning with God
[10:26] his whatever all things were made by him
[10:31] and without him was not anything made
[10:34] that was made in him was life
[10:38] and the life was the light of man
[10:42] and the light shineth in dark in the in
[10:47] darkness and the Darkness comprehended
[10:49] it not
[10:50] let's jump on over to the 14th verse of
[10:53] the same chapter
[10:55] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[10:58] amongst us and
[11:01] and we be beheld his glory the glory as
[11:05] to the only begotten son of the father
[11:09] so the word
[11:10] was made flesh and dwelt amongst us
[11:13] let's bar heads once again
[11:16] our dear Lord Jesus
[11:18] Lord God your word well that's true ever
[11:22] so true Lord Jesus and Lord as we want
[11:24] to
[11:25] consider well the the topic you know the
[11:28] mind of Christ and thinking Lord Jesus
[11:31] that you as Christ has been has revealed
[11:35] yourself in your own word Lord Jesus we
[11:38] pray O Lord God that you
[11:40] Feed Us Lord Jesus give us what we have
[11:42] need of this morning Lord God as we look
[11:45] into your word is things too great for
[11:47] us to really truly comprehend but lord
[11:50] it's by Revelation that you can give us
[11:52] each individual Lord God a a truth that
[11:55] you've given us in this day and age Lord
[11:57] not just to give us the truth Lord God
[11:59] but that we can just apply Our Lives to
[12:01] the truths that are given Lord in this
[12:04] day and age Lord Jesus we're so grateful
[12:06] for the word of God that you've departed
[12:08] to us this message of this hour Lord God
[12:10] your Prophet Lord Jesus bringing this
[12:12] truth Lord God that have been hidden
[12:15] Through the Ages Lord Jesus as we speak
[12:17] of things like the seals and and Lord
[12:19] the the different Revelations that Lord
[12:22] you brought to to to bring to our
[12:24] understanding Lord Jesus throughout all
[12:27] the denominal denominational ages Lord
[12:29] God they've probed and thought about
[12:31] these things Lord God throughout all
[12:34] time lord Jesus all the way back through
[12:35] the Old Testament Lord they waited and
[12:38] they seeked your they seek to know Your
[12:40] Name Lord Jesus and Lord all these
[12:43] things Lord God have come into a reality
[12:45] in this day and age Lord Jesus you
[12:47] revealed them to us Lord Jesus because
[12:49] we as your bride Lord God want to
[12:52] receive all that you have for us Lord
[12:54] God as we prepare for this day that's
[12:56] upon us Lord God the Rapture and the
[12:59] resurrection and the things that have
[13:00] come in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[13:03] bless your people amen
[13:06] maybe you could be seated
[13:07] amen
[13:09] you know I was uh
[13:12] looking at some of the things that uh
[13:14] that we're um where the days we're
[13:17] living in and and I I think a lot about
[13:20] the about what we should be what should
[13:23] be happening to this bride in this in
[13:25] this day and age you know and I know
[13:27] that you know the Bible says that
[13:29] there's a five-fold Ministry
[13:31] uh given to us for the perfecting of the
[13:34] Saints so I know that going to church
[13:37] and being where that fivefold Ministry
[13:39] is working is a big part of being in the
[13:43] position or being in my place at my time
[13:47] so I recognize the the work that these
[13:50] pastors have that these evangelists have
[13:52] that these that these missionaries have
[13:55] uh they they all have a great work and
[13:58] of course we do have a prophet and there
[14:00] are people gifted with prophecy I
[14:02] believe these things because they're in
[14:03] the word and I and I see that that we're
[14:06] standing in a day and age where where
[14:08] where we're we're looking at the at now
[14:12] New Beginnings
[14:13] we're looking at at a time that this
[14:16] bride should start looking for some kind
[14:18] of stabilization where she's she's not
[14:21] no longer uh moving from Pillar To Post
[14:24] or or questioning her her position in
[14:27] Christ she should be anchored and
[14:29] recognizing who she is and what she's
[14:31] doing and what kind of anointing is
[14:33] anointing her you know she should be
[14:36] recognizing the the day and hour she's
[14:38] living in and seeing the revealing of
[14:41] God's word in his day is her day
[14:44] recognizing that that that that that
[14:46] that that God's word is is is is is a
[14:49] lifestyle
[14:50] God's word is a it's not just a
[14:53] tradition we might not we don't come
[14:55] here just to to play church we come here
[14:58] because it's life to us
[15:00] you know there's an old man now uh that
[15:03] I knew back in the in in when I first
[15:06] came to this message and uh and he was
[15:09] going blind you know and he stood there
[15:11] and and he was sitting on his chair and
[15:14] he had he says look at my Bible and I
[15:16] looked at his bible and he said look I
[15:18] said my gosh there's big letters you
[15:19] know
[15:20] and he says you know I I I still want to
[15:23] read it he says and and my eyes are
[15:25] going so bad yeah
[15:27] and that says well what are you going to
[15:29] do brother Leo you're you're having
[15:31] trouble even reading these big big
[15:33] letters
[15:34] he says what are you going to do
[15:36] and he says Oh Brother Daniel he says
[15:38] this and he held up his Bible and he
[15:41] says this is my life
[15:44] I mean he put a lot of emphasis in it
[15:46] this is my life
[15:48] and I thought to myself you know well
[15:50] God bless you you know I said you know
[15:52] what I says it should be every one of us
[15:54] when we take a message book when we put
[15:57] those earbuds in our ears but we're
[15:59] listening to the word of God that's
[16:01] coming our day and age we should have
[16:03] that same feeling this is life to us
[16:05] this is we know that it's God speaking
[16:09] to us
[16:10] uh the brother in the in the uh
[16:13] bible study this yeah a couple uh well I
[16:17] got it here the the Bible study we just
[16:20] had here uh uh Sunday he was reading a
[16:24] quote where brother Branham in the in
[16:26] the uh
[16:27] Liu well let me look look hear what it
[16:30] is it's look
[16:33] look at looking at the Unseen
[16:36] all of a sudden brother Branham speaking
[16:38] not as himself
[16:40] but he's saying I am the Lord that
[16:43] raised up Christ from the grave I am the
[16:47] one that sent the Holy Ghost I am the
[16:50] one that gave the promise brother
[16:53] Branham has nothing to do with this I I
[16:57] have
[16:59] I have he's he's surrendered his life to
[17:04] me I'm using his Spirit I'm talking
[17:07] through his lips that's me I'm the Lord
[17:11] Glory
[17:12] I thought wow
[17:15] you know brother Branham many times
[17:17] would say
[17:19] I'm a minister
[17:21] humble as humble as he was he'd say I'm
[17:24] a minister you know I I I I can't call
[17:27] myself a prophet
[17:30] but yet he was able to just yield
[17:32] himself totally for our Lord Jesus
[17:35] Christ could speak through his using his
[17:37] voice
[17:38] well that's the kind of I would like to
[17:41] be just like that
[17:42] just a mouthpiece that God can use and
[17:45] speak to his people whatever they have
[17:48] need of and you know I realized that
[17:51] we're in a day and age when as we're
[17:53] coming to the to the this the coming of
[17:56] the Lord we're looking at a at a at
[17:58] Peerless times we're looking at troubles
[18:01] sometimes well if the government falls
[18:03] apart the way they're talking about it
[18:05] my wife was reading on her uh on her
[18:07] iPhone and says oh no she says the
[18:10] nuclear industry just fell apart
[18:13] I said you're not talking about the labs
[18:15] are you she says well it just says that
[18:18] and I don't know I said well read on
[18:20] let's just read on that's my job this is
[18:24] my life that's my job you're talking
[18:26] about oh she read on and it was
[18:28] something about all these uh future uh
[18:32] nuclear uh what do they call those uh uh
[18:35] where they make electricity
[18:37] and you they're not going to be building
[18:38] them now they're closing them down
[18:40] they're not going to let them uh build
[18:42] them so I said well at least they're not
[18:45] just turning off
[18:46] getting rid of all the old bombs that's
[18:49] my job you know
[18:52] and I was wondering if I was going to
[18:54] move to Georgia faster than I thought
[18:57] yeah to my my daughter she's been the
[19:00] City of Refuge for a long time
[19:02] for me and my kids yeah you know so uh
[19:07] so we're looking at at uh and she said
[19:10] well that's you know she says well if it
[19:11] happens well you got a place you know
[19:13] yeah well
[19:15] oh yeah he says you know what my house
[19:18] will be worth nothing Espanola would be
[19:19] a ghost town where I live because that's
[19:22] all the employment up there you know
[19:24] it's just like uh Rocky Flats you know
[19:27] and Boulder and all those places when
[19:29] they shut down the Plant there it just
[19:31] closed down the whole town you know so
[19:33] yeah it's a college town but uh it sure
[19:36] doesn't have the the the the finances it
[19:39] used to have
[19:41] amen and with the housing problems going
[19:43] on you never know what's going to happen
[19:45] right so now so we're bringing to a
[19:48] stabilization when we want to be stable
[19:50] we want to have the faith that was once
[19:52] delivered to the Saints we want to be
[19:54] able to look into the word of God and
[19:57] get some stability there because we we
[19:59] you know like like like Moses said one
[20:01] time we never passed this way before so
[20:03] we're looking at a at a place and and
[20:05] and and we look at at as as we're we're
[20:09] trying to get our stability and trying
[20:11] to understand where our position is in
[20:15] Christ and of course we recognize by the
[20:18] word of God that he's going to have a
[20:19] bride and we call ourselves the bride of
[20:22] Christ and we look at our at our it's
[20:25] not through anything of our natural
[20:27] ability but he chose us from the
[20:29] foundations of the world so we look at
[20:32] these things and we say look we know who
[20:34] we are we know that we're in the nervous
[20:36] age of Leo Josiah we know the devil's
[20:39] got one punch at us and we're guarding
[20:41] it in every way where he's got that
[20:44] punch coming we're trying trying to
[20:46] guard that you know many of us might
[20:48] have a little bit of arthritis or
[20:50] something and the devil wants to kick us
[20:52] on our Shin when we're hurting there we
[20:54] say well you know what I'm going to just
[20:55] protect that I'm not going to let him
[20:57] hit it you know and that's the same kind
[20:59] of thing you know the devil's got one
[21:00] punch at us he looks for every Avenue
[21:02] that he can to bring this bride to a to
[21:05] a place where she'll back off because he
[21:07] knows he buys time if he can get us get
[21:10] us to back off because the Lord said
[21:12] he's not going to lose the one so we're
[21:14] gonna We're Not Gonna back off for very
[21:16] long but but he wants to upset us
[21:18] somehow he'd like to up overturn the
[21:21] Apple card so that we got to take the
[21:23] time to pick up the apples you know it's
[21:26] just the way he is it's in his nature
[21:27] and and it is in his nature to upset
[21:30] this bride but this bride has something
[21:33] more than what she's not walking on her
[21:35] own right
[21:36] see the Lord's watching over her his
[21:39] elect he cares about his elect he knows
[21:42] your name he knows who you are he knows
[21:45] your position he knows what you're going
[21:47] through he knows your weaknesses he
[21:49] knows your strengths he knows where
[21:51] you're how you can you can uh uh uh uh
[21:54] how you can get a hold of God
[21:57] so so he he recognizes that he he
[22:00] doesn't want you he he he he may try
[22:03] Every Which Way but just like the
[22:05] scripture says he can't do anything
[22:07] unless he's allowed
[22:09] he can't do anything unless he's allowed
[22:11] and so he comes he may cry out like he
[22:13] cried out you know what you got a hedge
[22:15] around job you know you got to hedge
[22:18] around him nothing I can't get to him
[22:19] yeah
[22:20] he says well he says I'll give you one
[22:23] shot
[22:25] man but we as Christians well we know
[22:28] we've already had warning guard yourself
[22:30] just like any boxer you know you know
[22:33] the you know your opponent you know his
[22:34] cheap shots and you know your where your
[22:37] weaknesses are guard that weak spot put
[22:39] your hands up keep your guard up no it's
[22:43] too close to the time when when when
[22:45] when when we're coming to the coming of
[22:47] the Lord and it's too close to that time
[22:49] to be stumbling now put your guard up
[22:51] keep your you know we're looking at at
[22:54] our minds you know we recognize that
[22:57] with the day and age we're living in and
[22:59] and all the all the the the the the the
[23:02] the hybrid foods that we look at are
[23:05] well you know the other day we uh we we
[23:08] went and bought some chicken from
[23:10] I don't even know where it was she
[23:12] bought some chicken and it got delivered
[23:13] on a truck my wife and I said well what
[23:16] kind of chickens are those
[23:18] the breasts that she bought were this
[23:20] big
[23:21] I said these aren't chickens these are
[23:23] turkeys I think
[23:25] yeah this is no this chicken is so the
[23:27] census chicken
[23:29] so we've been eating it it tastes like
[23:31] chicken
[23:32] but you know
[23:34] sometimes they say that everything
[23:36] tastes like chicken so I'm not so sure
[23:38] but it sure was big big old chunks and I
[23:41] said well cut them in half and make them
[23:43] look like a real breast you know our
[23:45] little chickens don't give a breast that
[23:47] big but we're thinking you know what is
[23:49] it we're eating hybrid Foods
[23:52] somebody's doing something to the our
[23:55] food line that we're becoming weaker and
[23:58] wiser
[23:59] you say wiser well yeah this computer
[24:02] age is sending us wiser I mean uh any
[24:05] any little trivia question any little
[24:07] question we're we're arguing about well
[24:09] my son says well let's Google it he
[24:11] pulls out his phone
[24:12] and he checks the answer
[24:14] so we're wiser yeah we got all the
[24:16] answers now because we can pull up our
[24:18] iPhone but that doesn't make us that
[24:20] we're that but we are getting weaker
[24:22] right and the minds are getting weaker
[24:26] when you stand out there and you look at
[24:28] the world how they're getting weaker
[24:30] they're they're they're getting to the
[24:31] place where they're getting kind of
[24:33] crazy the other day up in Colorado a guy
[24:36] got up there and thought he was Batman
[24:38] and shot a bunch of people in the
[24:40] theater
[24:41] what reason what what mind do they have
[24:47] they playing a lot of mind I mean uh
[24:49] computer games and things where they
[24:51] want to just shoot anybody walking down
[24:53] the street I don't know what the reason
[24:55] is excuse me
[24:59] my throat
[25:00] I got a cough drop but it's kind of hard
[25:02] to hold it in my mouth okay
[25:06] so that guy killed all those people in
[25:07] Colorado just the other day in Boston
[25:09] they they bombed some people young
[25:12] people that I looked at their pictures
[25:13] young people that really have starting
[25:15] off in Life College college educations I
[25:19] wish I had a college education but
[25:21] College educations thrown away
[25:25] to go to the death to to go to be be
[25:27] killed in a in a in a I guess the death
[25:31] chamber or whatever they do I don't know
[25:32] what they'll give them but notice and
[25:34] one of them died and notice what's in
[25:37] their minds why is their mind so so so
[25:41] uh why are they getting so crazy yeah
[25:44] brother Brown said that one day there
[25:46] the the horrors that that this world can
[25:48] imagine those those those horror movies
[25:51] that you see of zombies and and giant
[25:53] ants and all these things that came out
[25:54] I remember those ones they were scary as
[25:56] ever that all those things that they
[25:58] that they that they spoke about back in
[26:00] those old days he says it'll become a
[26:02] reality where people will actually be
[26:05] seeing uh uh those those those those uh
[26:09] uh plagues that the Bible talks about
[26:11] that'll come out and torment women with
[26:14] long hair and teeth as lions and
[26:16] scorpions Tails those things will come
[26:18] out and they'll be real to the people
[26:21] how can they how can our minds get so so
[26:24] into a virtual world that these things
[26:27] become real
[26:29] I don't understand but the minds are
[26:31] weakening remember
[26:33] the minds are weakening where they're
[26:35] having uh where the where the thin line
[26:37] between reality and hell is being made
[26:41] thinner
[26:42] his main I mean here we we look at it we
[26:46] say well brother Brown talks about it he
[26:48] says
[26:49] this desk
[26:50] is less real
[26:52] than Heaven Is Right Heaven is more real
[26:56] than this desk Heaven is more real than
[26:58] this place Heaven is more real this
[27:00] thing can get foggy and just disappear
[27:02] away in a puff of smoke but you see
[27:04] Heaven is more real
[27:07] see Heaven is reality so what is it
[27:10] we're standing here we're saying angels
[27:12] are more real yeah angels are more real
[27:14] Jesus is more real the Holy Ghost is
[27:16] more real yes those things are more real
[27:19] we tell you we speak about it all these
[27:22] things but you stand here and you say
[27:23] what I can't feel it
[27:25] I can't touch it
[27:28] but yet it produced more right well you
[27:31] go to Hebrews one I mean Hebrews 11th
[27:33] chapter it says the worlds were created
[27:36] of things that don't exist
[27:38] I went through the uh
[27:40] I was I was uh uh looking at uh what was
[27:45] the name of the thing it was called uh
[27:51] I remember it was it was all about about
[27:54] God what was the name of that video
[27:56] brother that you that I had on my iPods
[27:59] I can't remember it but on it it was it
[28:03] was saying that that the worlds
[28:06] the worlds were all created by an
[28:09] explosion
[28:10] okay of matter that wasn't there yeah
[28:14] yeah and then how did they know that
[28:16] they just come into the understanding of
[28:18] that when here in Hebrews the Bible
[28:20] talks about it all along
[28:22] things are made of things that do not
[28:24] appear
[28:26] E equals MC square matter that that the
[28:30] the the the energy and matter they talk
[28:32] about and I I was looking at that I says
[28:35] how could this be
[28:37] how can they make something that how can
[28:39] the science say that they made something
[28:41] out of nothing
[28:43] is because God's the only creator
[28:45] and he can make something out of nothing
[28:49] so you start to see uh you start to see
[28:53] that that as as we start looking at at
[28:56] our place in our position as we look at
[28:59] ourselves as as our Humanity
[29:02] we start to say well look God knows us
[29:05] God had memory of us all the way back
[29:08] from the foundations of the Earth
[29:10] but yet he brought us to this place
[29:12] where where our inlets our seed tastes
[29:15] feel smell in here
[29:17] and yet we we contact our outside world
[29:21] through this uh seed taste field
[29:23] smelling here and inside our soul our
[29:26] memory our conscience our thinking all
[29:28] that the real us
[29:30] is not something that we can see taste
[29:32] feeler smell here the real us is is is
[29:34] is inside of us called our spirit
[29:37] and then even inside of that spirit is a
[29:40] nature and that nature is going to
[29:42] either say I doubt what God has said or
[29:46] I believe what God has said Faith or
[29:48] doubts the only channel that moves that
[29:51] inside nature and out of that if I
[29:53] believe God's word it motivates me
[29:56] it causes me to do things it causes me
[30:00] to want things it causes me to it
[30:02] changes my desires it changes my wants
[30:06] you know
[30:08] they were asking me how do you how do
[30:10] you stay away from the things of the
[30:12] world how do you how do you keep away
[30:14] from those things well my desires
[30:16] changed my want has changed
[30:19] I don't care to do the smoke and I don't
[30:21] care to do the drinking I don't care to
[30:23] do this do the gambling I don't care to
[30:25] do all those things why because there's
[30:27] a desire change that only God's my care
[30:31] is to get to where God is
[30:33] that's where my care is to be in his
[30:36] presence to be in his truth to hear his
[30:39] ministers to hear those that got the
[30:41] word of God for my day and my hour
[30:42] that's where I'm that's where where
[30:45] God's motivating me to and that's what
[30:48] and now when when we stop to talk about
[30:50] the mind how do you get into how do you
[30:53] get into that kind of nature yeah well
[30:58] I was listening to brother Brown talking
[31:00] about that orange tree
[31:02] and uh it inspired me I went over there
[31:05] and I grabbed me a a pocket knife and I
[31:08] got a I got a uh I got a I went to my
[31:11] peach pear tree
[31:13] and I cut off a branch off the pear tree
[31:15] and I looked it up on on a book and I
[31:18] saw that all you have to do is cut a
[31:19] slant
[31:20] slant and then use electrical tape and
[31:23] tape it
[31:24] so I got this pear tree and I walked
[31:26] over to my apple tree which is a red
[31:28] delicious
[31:30] and I cut off one of the red delicious
[31:32] branches and patched that that Pear Tree
[31:35] on there yeah
[31:37] well weeks went on and Springtime came
[31:40] and summertime came in and the crazy
[31:42] thing God blossoms
[31:45] leaves
[31:48] well here's a pear growing off of an
[31:50] apple tree I said well I'm going to have
[31:52] me some red pears
[31:54] so the blossoms got bigger and I knew
[31:56] that little graph wasn't going to hold
[31:57] it so I put a little weight a little
[31:59] stick to support it so it wouldn't break
[32:00] it off
[32:01] and the pear started growing
[32:03] well green pair well I'm waiting I'll
[32:05] wait till it ripens I'll wait till it
[32:07] ripens
[32:09] started ripening ripening it got totally
[32:12] ripe it was still a green pear it was a
[32:15] kefir a kefir a hard pair
[32:17] I said well I expect an apple a red
[32:20] delicious color on it nothing came out
[32:23] it was still the nature of the branch
[32:26] it was still the nature of the branch
[32:28] and exactly like the tree produced over
[32:31] there on the pear tree It produced the
[32:33] same thing out of an apple tree
[32:35] except one thing I noticed uh it didn't
[32:38] last very long because for some reasons
[32:40] pear grow faster than Apples and the
[32:42] patch never did heal it just kept
[32:45] growing growing growing growing until it
[32:46] broke off but
[32:48] it happened I I got that far and I was
[32:51] thinking about nature you know the
[32:53] nature in the branch
[32:55] and I thought well
[32:57] in uh brother Brown preaching and ye
[32:59] must be born again
[33:01] he says well he says you have to he says
[33:05] your nature
[33:06] he says your old uh uh born in sin
[33:10] shaped in iniquity come to the world
[33:11] speaking lies that nature that you were
[33:14] born with that you grew up with that
[33:17] pulls you towards the television that
[33:20] pulls you towards Hollywood that pulls
[33:22] you towards the the comic books and the
[33:25] and the and the video games and the and
[33:27] then it pulls you towards all the the
[33:29] little kitty gambling machines at the
[33:32] store you know where you are put in the
[33:34] corners and all this it pulls you
[33:36] towards all these things pretty soon
[33:39] God comes in and takes a hold of you
[33:42] and you and you and some of us at a
[33:45] later day some kids are kids some of us
[33:47] already when we're pulled into the bad
[33:50] things of all the world's got to offer
[33:52] and some and when we get pulled into all
[33:54] that we still have a cardinal nature
[33:58] we still lie every chance we get and
[34:01] what happens all of a sudden
[34:04] when you bump into what what happened to
[34:07] me is I got a hold of a tape
[34:09] yeah you know I got a hold of a tape and
[34:12] I saw there was something in that tape
[34:14] there's there's something I want there
[34:17] I didn't have it I was in the world I
[34:20] didn't have it but there's something
[34:21] there there's a nature there there's
[34:23] something there I want
[34:26] and I want it more than I want my own
[34:27] life
[34:29] and what happened is little by little
[34:33] okay I started crying out I want the
[34:35] Holy Ghost I want God to move in my life
[34:38] I want it so bad I want God and I'm
[34:41] listening to the tapes I'm hearing what
[34:42] brother Brown's preaching and I says
[34:44] whatever he has I don't have I want that
[34:48] I'm trying to get there and struggling
[34:52] for it and all of a sudden I start
[34:55] noticing hey
[34:56] I don't want those things anymore
[34:59] it's a nature change I don't care for
[35:01] the things of the world anymore amen I
[35:03] don't care for all I care about is the
[35:06] things of God
[35:07] what's happening there's a nature change
[35:09] I want to be I want to be that I want to
[35:13] speak the word amen I want that third
[35:15] pool I want the things that God has
[35:18] promised for my day and age that's
[35:20] coming to me now that's what I want
[35:22] that's what my desire is I want to see
[35:25] the resurrection I want to see my my
[35:28] loved ones come back I want to see the
[35:30] calling up of God that he moves on the
[35:33] people where they're gone for the
[35:35] rapture
[35:36] those are the desires that are coming
[35:37] now and I want to see this Bride come
[35:40] into her position
[35:42] where she says look it's no longer me
[35:44] anymore it's Christ in me
[35:47] amen how can we get there how can we get
[35:50] the mind of Christ how do we get to be
[35:52] born well and you must be born again he
[35:55] says that old nature is killed
[35:58] it's put on the Brown's altar it's
[36:01] sacrificed it goes up in smoke and God's
[36:04] Own nature God's holy ghost comes to
[36:07] dwell in your body
[36:11] it's no longer what happens then
[36:13] like the fruit like that up like that
[36:16] pear tree I like that pear branch has no
[36:19] ability but to produce
[36:21] what its nature is and what is our
[36:25] nature now that we've come into the Holy
[36:27] Ghost come into the presence of God come
[36:30] into it's love joy peace long-suffering
[36:33] gentleness kindness meekness Temperance
[36:35] the the things written in Galatians 5
[36:37] 22. you should start to see that God's
[36:40] own Spirit comes down in you so what are
[36:44] we doing we're starting to catch the
[36:46] mind of Christ now as we read our word
[36:48] now as we read our Bible we start to see
[36:52] that hey it starts to make sense right
[36:55] no longer are we just bumbling through
[36:57] you know at the beginning I heard the
[36:59] seals
[37:01] I read the seals
[37:03] I'll tell you I know that of all those
[37:06] things that brother Brown talked about
[37:08] and where he talked about the marriage
[37:10] and divorce and and the The Mystery of
[37:13] the godhead and all these things
[37:16] but I'm still saying but there's still
[37:19] something else there's still more amen
[37:21] there's the Thunders there's a mystery
[37:24] there's this there's that I stayed
[37:26] wondering and well and and and and still
[37:29] my life was not coming to the place
[37:30] where I could live this gospel
[37:34] without having Christ in my life you're
[37:37] never going to get to a place where you
[37:39] can get with without having the Holy
[37:41] Ghost
[37:42] it's come to a place where uh you know I
[37:45] I'm all my messages anymore get to
[37:49] Christ get to the Holy Ghost get to the
[37:52] anointing of the Holy Ghost because if
[37:54] you don't have that you won't make the
[37:56] resurrection right if you go by way of
[37:58] the grave
[37:59] if you don't have that you you can't
[38:02] understand what God's trying to reveal
[38:04] in your day and age
[38:05] if you don't have the Holy Ghost you
[38:08] don't even have life yet you're not even
[38:09] in his economy
[38:11] so you got to have the Holy Ghost
[38:14] amen you got to have the presence of God
[38:16] in your life you got to have the
[38:17] anointing of his of his of his power and
[38:20] his manifestation then you can come back
[38:22] and say look all the promises in his
[38:26] word well they're my possession
[38:28] I married to these things I got a right
[38:31] to call out Abba Father
[38:34] you know I got a right to say this is my
[38:36] possession Satan you have no right here
[38:38] this is my possession
[38:41] amen
[38:43] how do you get to that place when you
[38:45] get into his mind you start to
[38:47] understand what he's trying to get you
[38:49] to see
[38:50] amen but we look at it all all that the
[38:54] father has given me will come and no man
[38:57] can take them out of his hands amen
[38:59] that's so we realize that when you've
[39:02] come to the place when he knows when he
[39:05] knows you he knows your name he knows
[39:07] what you are he knows what's going on in
[39:09] your life he knows how to fix it he
[39:12] knows how you can take the faith and
[39:14] believe what his word says he knows that
[39:16] if you go by way of the Grave it'll
[39:18] bring you out of the Grave amen because
[39:20] he is the Holy Ghost he is the
[39:22] resurrection in life amen so you start
[39:25] to see
[39:27] just like Levi paid tithes in the loins
[39:29] of Abraham you were in the thoughts of
[39:32] God from the beginning from the
[39:34] foundation of the world you were in
[39:35] Christ when he went to Calvary you were
[39:38] in Christ you've been in Christ all
[39:40] along and all you can do is just
[39:43] manifest what's in you
[39:46] man that's all you can do right right
[39:48] Hallelujah
[39:50] what is it
[39:53] well you start to look and we start to
[39:54] see look there's nothing I can and I can
[39:57] say that uh that would bring you to the
[39:59] to the place where you say I at the you
[40:03] know and the anointed ones at the end
[40:04] time
[40:05] Birdman says you can get anointed right
[40:07] in your spirit
[40:09] you can get anointed in your spirit and
[40:12] you can make do all the you can play out
[40:15] all that the Holy Ghost has yeah
[40:18] you can you could I mean uh you can you
[40:21] can be back here behind the pulpit yeah
[40:23] ministering
[40:25] and not how even be part of the economy
[40:27] of God
[40:29] how can this be
[40:31] because it's per it's it's true that you
[40:34] can get anointed in your spirit
[40:36] but if you don't have the nature down in
[40:39] your soul
[40:40] you got to have the Holy Ghost that's
[40:41] that all comes down to it that is the
[40:44] life amen so whatever what are we
[40:47] looking at
[40:48] we're trying to see how how his mind is
[40:50] and what what were to become as we're as
[40:54] we're coming into the the the the days
[40:57] of the manifestation of the sons of God
[41:00] when we come to the place where we look
[41:02] at Saint John 1 1 and and and we look at
[41:06] what that that that that that Christ
[41:10] has now
[41:12] the scripture says in first John 1 1 it
[41:15] says and the Word was made flesh and
[41:18] dwelt amongst us
[41:19] okay that same word
[41:22] that you were in a Calvary
[41:24] it's now come to the place where it has
[41:27] to manifest itself for what the
[41:29] prophecies that were mentioned through
[41:32] the age through this age have to become
[41:35] alive in you
[41:37] it has to come to a place where you say
[41:39] look I have to manifest something here
[41:42] it's my part to play here
[41:45] I got to produce what brother Brown was
[41:48] talking about
[41:49] how am I going to produce it I don't got
[41:51] it
[41:52] I don't got it I'm searching my pocket I
[41:54] don't got it
[41:58] you know what
[42:00] it's just like that black man that
[42:02] brother Brown says uh that that this
[42:04] little story where he says you're going
[42:06] to jump through that wall
[42:07] and he says well he says uh if God's
[42:11] word tells me to jump through that wall
[42:12] I'm going to start heading to that wall
[42:15] he says you can't go through that wall
[42:17] there's no hole there he says if God's
[42:19] words telling me to head to that wall
[42:21] and jump through that wall he'll make a
[42:23] Hole by the time I arrive there
[42:26] and that's what's happening we're coming
[42:28] to a rapture we might think we don't
[42:31] possess what it takes to make the
[42:34] Rapture but if you've got the Holy Ghost
[42:36] you've got all it takes because he's
[42:39] going to bring you to a place where
[42:41] it'll manifest itself in your life at
[42:44] the time that it's necessary you say
[42:46] necessary a third pool
[42:49] when Pentecost years ago Pentecost talks
[42:53] about times
[42:54] when somebody shoots bullets through a
[42:57] wall and they fall off of the sisters
[42:59] dresses yeah
[43:01] says they never penetrate they penetrate
[43:03] the wall okay
[43:05] they go through big big big guns go
[43:08] through a wall okay but they just can't
[43:11] get through the sister's dress why
[43:12] because there's an anointing there
[43:15] is an anointing there and that anointing
[43:18] is the Holy Ghost and when the anointing
[43:20] of the Holy Ghost is here it's here to
[43:23] take you to a certain place brother
[43:25] Brown said this Bride of the last age
[43:29] of this day is it isn't going to go down
[43:33] like the first bride did right
[43:35] the first bride gave her life through
[43:37] the Lion's Denson all
[43:39] those Roman gladiators took their swords
[43:42] out sliced their heads off
[43:44] if the Roman gladiators with their
[43:47] techno equipment come in here now
[43:51] and open up set their Clips in and start
[43:54] firing I doubt very much that one bullet
[43:57] will pierce one Christian
[43:59] why because we're at a time of a third
[44:02] pool
[44:03] we're at a time when you know when you
[44:06] when you look at it it says you know
[44:08] David David talks about times where
[44:11] where where they fall to his right they
[44:13] fall to his life but no nothing's
[44:16] hitting him
[44:18] my brother was talking about his time in
[44:20] Vietnam
[44:22] and he says Daniel I don't understand it
[44:25] he was telling me
[44:28] he said we're walking through the bush
[44:31] he says the guy on the front of me Falls
[44:33] over
[44:34] the guy on back of me Falls over I look
[44:37] at the jungle right around me and it's
[44:38] bullets are hidden right in the in the
[44:41] leaves right around me
[44:43] I don't know what happened I was stoned
[44:46] out of my mind but not one of them would
[44:48] hit me
[44:49] not one of those bullets would hit me
[44:53] and I says you know my you know you know
[44:56] that your mother's prayers were going
[44:57] out for you all the time you were in the
[45:00] bush
[45:01] I says we stood there and we prayed and
[45:04] prayed Catholics
[45:05] praying at a at an altar and and uh what
[45:08] do they call that a clay saint
[45:10] praying at an altar and a clay saying
[45:12] but we were praying for you
[45:14] and those prayers met the feet of God
[45:17] and he he saved you right he says he
[45:20] saved you possibly so you can come to
[45:22] the Lord today
[45:24] you know I kept telling him the Lord's
[45:27] dealing with you
[45:29] so what happens
[45:31] We Believe
[45:33] that just like God can take take and
[45:36] keep keep someone in all this atrocity
[45:39] we know that he can keep the bride of
[45:41] Christ because it's her brother his
[45:43] bride
[45:44] you know when you realize the price that
[45:46] was paid for you
[45:48] when you realize he went to Calvary for
[45:51] you when you realize the suffering he
[45:53] did he did it so that this bride can be
[45:56] part of him
[45:58] the price he paid for you he ain't going
[46:00] to let you fall
[46:02] he's not going to take you this far to
[46:04] let you fall
[46:05] right so we know want to know them and
[46:07] as we start to look at the mind of
[46:09] Christ and we start to look at the
[46:11] examples that God gave us through his
[46:13] word and we start to see the very uh uh
[46:17] way that he has kept it he has kept it
[46:20] from from from being uh uh uh what you
[46:23] call it uh adulterer sized or or changed
[46:27] or or moved around he's kept his word
[46:29] throughout all the ages
[46:31] well he's here to keep his bride too
[46:33] amen he wants his bride to be ready and
[46:36] the things that now you start to look at
[46:38] the things that that this bride's
[46:40] bringing to look through the ages you
[46:43] look
[46:46] you know when we look at at out there we
[46:49] say Okay baptism
[46:50] let's say a Catholic guy gets up there
[46:52] and says well you know what
[46:54] uh I'm going to go to my priest and ask
[46:56] him why is it we don't submerge we don't
[46:59] we don't go under the water you sprinkle
[47:01] us
[47:03] and the priest says well that's the way
[47:04] the church does it yeah
[47:06] and he's got a decision to make
[47:08] am I going to do it according to the
[47:10] word because John was baptizing where
[47:12] there was much water and submerging the
[47:14] people
[47:15] or am I going to get sprinkled yeah
[47:18] yeah he says well maybe he'd say I'm
[47:20] going to take the word
[47:21] I'm leaving the Catholic Church
[47:24] and he goes over to a good Baptist
[47:25] Church in the Baptist Church says well
[47:27] we sprinkled to we don't sprinkle we
[47:30] baptize we put you right under the water
[47:33] then he finds out here in the word it
[47:35] says in Acts 2 38. it's
[47:37] are you doing it in the name of of the
[47:39] Lord Jesus Christ
[47:41] and they said well no we use Matthew 28
[47:44] 19 father son Holy Ghost
[47:47] he says well my absolute is to believe
[47:50] the Baptist Church no the word of God
[47:53] so now you're going to have to baptize
[47:56] me or I got to find somebody that'll
[47:57] baptize me in the name of the Lord Jesus
[48:00] Christ it's submersion
[48:03] okay
[48:05] wait a minute
[48:07] along with Acts 19 I mean Acts 2 38 it
[48:10] says and you shall receive the gift of
[48:13] the Holy Ghost
[48:14] well if I got baptized and I got caught
[48:17] they called the name of the Lord Jesus
[48:19] Christ on me why don't I got the Holy
[48:22] Ghost I have a right to that that's part
[48:24] of the promise in my word in the word of
[48:26] God so now we go to prayer and we start
[48:28] saying Lord give me the Holy Ghost give
[48:31] me the anointing of your spirit give me
[48:32] the power of God give me all that you
[48:35] are bring it down deliver me that's the
[48:37] nature of God coming down and living in
[48:40] you to where no longer is it your words
[48:42] anymore
[48:43] but it's him that wants to do his work
[48:45] in you
[48:46] amen
[48:48] so are we we're looking at the trueness
[48:50] we're looking at look we're we're coming
[48:52] to a place now we start coming down to
[48:54] okay we got through all the
[48:56] denominations and got back to the word
[48:58] of God now we want to hear the more
[49:01] excellent way
[49:02] we want to hear the more truthful way
[49:06] so when we come to the message we talk
[49:08] about clothesline all your sisters
[49:10] aren't supposed to cut your hair and oh
[49:12] you brothers are your sisters aren't
[49:14] supposed to put on a pair of pants oh

[49:28] comes down are you really taking hold
[49:31] your Bible reading your Bible every day

[49:37] you know I saw a good example of this
[49:39] but my son-in-law Joseph
[49:41] my gosh he has scriptures written all
[49:44] over his walls and he's not just leaving
[49:47] them there for pretty he goes and looks
[49:48] at them and reads them every day well

[50:01] to look at it I look at I look at
[50:03] reading your Bible praying every day
[50:05] fasting seeking the Lord seeking for
[50:08] Revelation seeking for asking God in
[50:11] desperation you know I got in
[50:13] desperation when when when when when the
[50:16] Jews took over Jerusalem
[50:18] that's a few years ago the Jews took
[50:21] over Jerusalem
[50:22] and I started praying and crying and
[50:24] asking God what is it Are we almost in
[50:27] time for the rapture

[50:32] deeper into the messages looking for
[50:34] what's gonna happen our time clock the
[50:37] Jews have moved a big step they took

[51:23] God's word won't fall to the ground he's
[51:26] made he's kept it through the years he's
[51:28] watched it he makes sure that it's going
[51:31] to come to pass

[52:23] where I'm walking in faith where I'm
[52:25] praying for my brethren where instead of
[52:28] gossiping about my brethren I'm praying
[52:30] for my brethren
[52:31] have I come to the place where I'm I'm
[52:33] looking towards Higher Grounds seeking
[52:36] to be seeking the Holy Ghost saying to

[52:41] want to know more about what you got to
[52:43] show me in this day and age

[53:09] the Saints
[53:10] amen where you walk up and say silver
[53:12] and gold I don't have but such as I have
[53:14] I'll give to you in the name of Jesus
[53:17] Christ rise to your feet how can you say
[53:19] that you can only say it if you have it
[53:23] amen you can't say anything you don't
[53:25] God
[53:27] amen and when we look at the trueness of
[53:29] it throughout all ages when we're
[53:31] talking about astronomy
[53:33] they used to say science used to say
[53:35] that the Earth was center of the
[53:38] universe
[53:39] I opened up a National Geographic map of
[53:42] the universe and they said they don't
[53:45] have it all in this map
[53:47] and I saw that the Earth is one little
[53:49] small Speck
[53:51] in the corner of the Milky Way galaxy
[53:53] somewhere
[53:55] why does God look so much on us
[53:58] why does he care so much of this little
[54:00] speck amen
[54:02] because this little specks in his heart
[54:04] they're in the hands of God
[54:07] amen that little speck is predestinated
[54:10] called elected Amen to manifest thus
[54:14] saith the Lord for her day at her hour
[54:16] how can you say thou saith the Lord for
[54:19] my day and my hour the only way you can
[54:20] say it is if you're you've been in the
[54:23] word of God
[54:25] you've been in there you've seek your
[54:27] your feeding off the fountain
[54:31] amen you're feeding off the fountain
[54:33] that's never running dry you're really
[54:35] he's revealing himself to you
[54:38] amen so we know that as as in the
[54:43] aspects of of God's word we look at the
[54:46] at time time is running to running out
[54:51] you say well uh uh I wonder why why the
[54:55] economy is going the way it's going
[54:58] well the economy the economy it's not as
[55:02] it seems
[55:04] right there's things that go on behind
[55:06] the scenes
[55:07] there's big money shuffling around
[55:10] Nations being sold off
[55:13] in Africa you know that a lot of those
[55:16] wars were caused by Big Money moving
[55:18] around someplace else not even in Africa
[55:20] right
[55:22] because somebody out there wants
[55:25] uh wants the power oh yeah right does it
[55:30] even want the land
[55:32] just wants to say I'm in power
[55:36] and big money moves around and there
[55:38] goes
[55:39] nations of people
[55:43] what is it we start to look at it these
[55:46] aren't as they seem but we know they're
[55:48] all in God's hands
[55:50] he only allows Satan to do what he
[55:53] allows him to do and it will bring
[55:56] prophecy to pass
[55:57] it'll our everything will bring prophecy
[56:00] to pass sometimes you might say well
[56:03] I don't think that cars ever going to
[56:05] materialize we'll never have a car that
[56:07] drives itself out there in the highways
[56:09] where somebody's playing checkers while
[56:10] it's driving down the road never
[56:14] don't don't throw it too far it could
[56:17] happen in a second hey maybe putting it
[56:20] on General Motors may have it on the
[56:21] design table right now
[56:23] hey Matt you never you just don't know
[56:25] Toyota might have it out there you don't
[56:27] know but we do know this
[56:29] that God's words more true
[56:32] than anything that you can see in the
[56:35] news in the world in the things to come
[56:38] God's words more true he's kept it
[56:41] Through the Ages you know if you look at
[56:44] it through Noah through through Moses
[56:46] through Noah through through through our
[56:49] lord Jesus throughout all times
[56:51] he's kept it only because he wants to be
[56:54] sure that you have it in his purity
[56:57] you personally have it in his Purity to
[57:01] bring you to a faith
[57:03] to the faith that will bring you to a
[57:06] rapturing faith glory amen God bless you

[57:12] before the Lord in prayer

[57:18] funny sounding but I know
[57:21] that as we look at at the day we're
[57:23] living in
[57:25] we're looking at a time you know when we
[57:27] start looking at the sages of all the
[57:28] Paul and and Daniel and Isaiah and of
[57:32] course when we start looking at at their
[57:35] their their plight

[1:05:00] this is not William Branham
[1:05:02] let's see when are we going to start
[1:05:03] believing
[1:05:05] that it's not you and I that's asking
[1:05:08] but is God asking through us
[1:05:11] it's God using us
[1:05:13] you know
[1:05:15] and that way then
[1:05:16] we can say this is God speaking God
[1:05:19] using us to to say these things go ahead
[1:05:22] and read it one more let's before we go
[1:05:23] anybody have a need
[1:05:26] remember the fellowship meeting this
[1:05:28] coming Saturday be much in prayer
[1:05:57] and leave my face
[1:06:01] in Jesus Jesus
[1:06:07] trust being confined
[1:06:17] from all harmful
[1:06:21] any Sheltering all
[1:06:26] I'm living my life
[1:06:41] arise
[1:06:58] until God relationship the worst they
[1:07:02] can do it
[1:07:03] and if he does
[1:07:06] Rejoice that he was like enough of us
[1:07:13] he can trust us
[1:07:17] from all arms
[1:07:34] one more verse before we go
[1:07:44] will help
[1:07:48] like a brother was saying
[1:07:51] the Bible was saying it's the world and
[1:07:54] all is made of things that do not appear
[1:07:59] I'd rather could tell us a lot about an
[1:08:01] atom and you can hold them in your hands
[1:08:10] they're a whole lot greater than we are
[1:08:13] cutling blow us apart
[1:08:17] which really it is made of things that
[1:08:19] do not appear
[1:08:22] any Sheltering on
[1:08:27] I'm living my face
[1:08:35] make sure you tell your brother how much
[1:08:38] you appreciate him for speaking for us
[1:08:39] tonight because we truly do we believe
[1:08:42] it
[1:08:43] the word of the Lord amen

[1:08:48] meeting Saturday so if you would if you

[1:09:37] safe trip had a good Minister's meeting
[1:09:38] had a had a a good time in the Lord but
[1:09:41] we were brother Tim Calhoun and I roomed
[1:09:44] together and we were getting ready to go
[1:09:46] to the
[1:09:48] um Saturday morning we had a ministers
[1:09:51] meeting
[1:09:52] and you know I wear contact so I put one
[1:09:55] in
[1:09:56] and I reached over to get something and
[1:09:59] it fell off my finger the second one
[1:10:02] I looked the floor over I got down on my
[1:10:05] hands and knees with my hands you know
[1:10:07] how it'll curl up you know I got down on
[1:10:09] my hands and knees feeling around looked
[1:10:11] all over the countertop walked in there
[1:10:13] I said brother Tim I've lost the contact
[1:10:16] and I don't want to wear glasses all day
[1:10:19] I said let's just believe that the
[1:10:20] Lord's gonna
[1:10:22] tell us where that contact is I walk
[1:10:25] back in in the bathroom
[1:10:28] now I'd search that bathroom over before
[1:10:29] I went and told him that
[1:10:30] he said okay brother so I walked in that
[1:10:33] bathroom
[1:10:34] and I walked in the bathroom and I got
[1:10:35] down I just thought it might have been
[1:10:36] on the floor because that's where my
[1:10:38] finger was the floor was here and then
[1:10:39] here's the counter and when I got down
[1:10:41] on my knees something just audible said
[1:10:43] look up
[1:10:45] and I have a can of shaving cream that's
[1:10:47] the color of Chris's shirt the top the
[1:10:50] lid that thing's sitting right in the
[1:10:52] middle of that lid amen
[1:10:54] just as pretty as you please
[1:10:56] and then something said just look up and
[1:10:58] when I looked up I was down I looked up
[1:11:00] and I was almost eye level with the with
[1:11:02] the can and they're sitting on top of it
[1:11:04] it wasn't my contact so the Lord does
[1:11:06] answer prayers
[1:11:08] he knew he knew I needed that to get
[1:11:10] through the rest of the weekend so that
[1:11:12] was the Lord doing that because it
[1:11:14] wasn't me because I looked all over the
[1:11:15] place trying to find that thing so but
