61-0428 - Getting In The Spirit
You know stagnated water gets these little wiggletails in it. That’s what’s the matter with the Church today: a little wiggle in here and wiggle out there. Everything…“Days of miracles is past. No such a thing as Divine healing.” Can’t sit still five minutes in a meeting. Oh, my goodness. Stagnated water, beaver dam, blow it out. Amen. There is a fountain filled with Blood, drawn from Emmanuel’s veins. Where sinners plunged beneath the flood, lose all their guilty stains.

62 Prophet said, “Get down there and dig all them logs out.” “Well, I tell you then, prophet, should we go back and have another mighty rushing wind?” “Nope.” “Shall we start 
another latter rain?” “Nope, nope. Just clean out the channel. That’s all you have to do.” We got the people, just clean out the channel. The people’s all right. Get the channels cleaned out so the Holy Spirit can come in. All your fanaticisms, and isms, and everything else that’s in the church, clean the thing out. The Rock’s already smitten, the waters are fresh, running, but our ecclesiastical systems has dammed up the stream.He said, “Clean those things out. You won’t have to have another rushing wind. You won’t hear neither wind nor see any rain, but yet there’ll be water there.” Oh, brother. Not a new system, not a new system we need. What we need is clean out the system we got. Not make another Assemblies of God or another Oneness, but just clean out the Oneness and Assemblies we got. Get all the logs out of it. All the differences, the fussing, and stewing, and things like that away from them, the waters will go to flowing back again.There’ll be love, joy, joy like a river, just flowing all over everybody, just in love with one another.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
god bless you all brother white asked me to teach sunday school this morning to fill in for brother bob and i just want y'all to remember brother bob and his family sister monica's dad and everything just keep them in your prayers as they travel this weekend and any decisions they have to make you know it's a tough time they're going through i think right now i haven't heard any updates but you know just keep remembering them in your prayers if y'all can start that powerpoint back there brother anderson if you've ever heard me teach sunday school i pretty much always teach the same thing seek you first the kingdom of god and that's one thing that's near and dear to my heart it has been for for many years and i usually approach it from different angles but it's all more or less the same thing because i know as christians we can become kind of complacent and it's been on my mind for a lot of different reasons here lately that you know starting back into flying airplanes i got real rusty for all those years of not flying and it reminded me because i've been doing these working on these landings trying to perfect them there's never a perfect landing you're never done as a as a pilot trying to land a plane you're always trying to make these little course corrections i call them you know just little bitty adjustments and never stop fighting to get it just right same thing when you're driving a car any of you that drive cars you know you're always maybe subconsciously doing this if you when you leave today just watch your hands while you're driving down the road and see if you're not doing this you're always making these little course corrections trying to stay in the road and you just get so used to doing it you don't even realize you're doing it but you never stop trying to to do right and to stay in your lane you never stop trying to do right as a pilot and landing that plane right and as a christian we should never stop being seeking god every single day and making these sort of little course corrections along the way there's always more room for growth always more room for seeking more of god complacency is a killer that's something that that thought came to my mind here recently never become complacent so let's uh this lesson is about open channels and as you see here i've got this picture of a river and god is this eternal life this source of eternal life is never ceasing there's always more we can draw from him he's constantly flowing but we're the ones that cut off that flow of eternal life and those blessings he's so full of benefits brother richie douglas was preaching recently about the benefits of being a christian benefits of serving god there's so many benefits and that healing and salvation of course and eternal life but so many benefits that go just unending but if you don't seek god and then and don't keep those channels open the channels between you and god you can stop that flow brother wade preached recently i guess well it wasn't that recent about logs in the river you know that river will flow but if you get logs in the river it stops that flow so go to the next slide please so what i'm talking about in a nutshell is spending time with god that's brother bob's phrase for spending time with god it's anything you do in your private time with the lord and these are just some of the things that are that i use basically in my daily walk read the bible pray listen to and read sermons come to church fellowship meditate and worship and just curious in the back can y'all see all that pretty good okay this is my first time doing it up here so i didn't know if i needed to maybe next time make it bigger anything you do on your daily basis to spend time with god there are things in christianity that are automatic you know and then there are things that are not and this is one of those things that are not automatic you taking time out of your day is not automatic you make yourself do this this is something you have to if you want to say routine whatever just do it you set aside some time every day and spend time with god doing all of these things this is basically a format that i follow every every night when i drive the truck i start out listening to a sermon if i get tired i switch to gospel music i start praising the lord that's number six there worship i spend time in prayer and meditation thinking on these things the things we hear preached and all that and there's no substitute for eating our daily bread as a christian there's no substitute for that so brother brown talked about drinking and pushing out you know there's all these benefits of god but you have to drink in the word of god then you push out the healing and all the other things that you have need of in your journey all right next slide please so getting in the spirit i'm going to try to speed through these quotes because i don't have a whole lot of time and i've got a lot of notes you know stagnated water gets in the little wiggle tails in that's what's the matter with the church today a little wiggle tail little wiggle here a little wigger out there everything days and miracles have passed no such thing as divine healing can't sit still five minutes in a meeting oh my goodness stagnated water beaver dam blow it out amen there's a fountain filled with blood drawn from emmanuel's veins where sinners plunged beneath the flood lose all their guilty stain and next slide this is from the same sermon getting the spirit the prophet he's talking about the prophet elijah okay elisha the second kings three probably say get down there and dig all them logs out well i'll tell you then profit should we go back and have another mighty rushing wind nope should we start another ladder rain no no just clean out the channel that's all you have to do we got all the people just clean out the channel people's all right get the channel cleaned out so the holy spirit can come in all your fanaticisms and his and everything else in the church clean the thing out the rock's already smitten the waters are fresh running but the cleveland system has dammed up the stream the next time and i'm just trying to skip through this because i don't have the main quote i want to get to is the next one so not a new system we need we need clean the system we got get all the logs out of it there's differences the fussing things doing and things like that get away from them the water will go to flowing again they'll be love okay now this is a quote this is one that uh we play a lot for my for my girls for our girls uh we listen to it a lot at home it's i really love this tape if you get a chance to go back and listen to it come follow me and it's just so surreal to hear brother ben's tone of voice and it's just so quiet and you hear like fans or something right in the background it's just very very real i just love it and what he's talking about here is a really dear thing to me but there's one thing that you just don't inherit you've got to accept it that's eternal life and you only do that by following jesus by a born-again experience don't neglect that little story one time i heard of a man who was oh he was poor and he always wanted to it's a little fairy story like always stuck with me though and one day he picked a flower and the flower was magic and the flower answered to him and said you've been poor all your life he said now ask what you will and it'll be given to you it's like jesus said if you abide in me and my word about you ask what you will but how does that word get in us it's not some magic it's by daily reading the bible and praying and seeking the lord i don't know any other way he said that yonder's mountain would be opened up and i could go in there and find the gold in the mountain well he said you have to take me with you wherever you go i know that's really small that's gonna be hard to see i'm sorry about that you have to take me with you so wherever i am then you can ask what you will he walked to the mountain the mountain opened up and he went in the shells were full of gold and diamonds this is kind of like eternal life when you first come to eternal life there's this great mountain that just opens up to us it's great full of all these blessings of god they're speaking in tongues and good feelings and there's anointings of to do all kinds of things all this power and wonders and just signs wonderful miracles all these great things but the main thing is eternal life and he run and grabbed a great big gym and he said i must go and show this to my friends and now i'm a rich man i have everything now i must show this and so the flower spoke but said you forgot the main thing so he runs back and he picks it up says well maybe i'll get a piece of gold i'll pick up get a piece of silver and so he said i'll hurry out and tell the people how rich i am see what i've got and he got to the door and the flower said but you forgot the main thing so he runs back and he says and here we have all kinds of materials i'm gonna stop there for a second there are anointings of god to do these things and that is god okay i'm not condemning that and saying that's not of god speaking in tongues and all that but so many times people stop and build a denomination around that and say well i'm just going to set up shop right here this is a wonderful thing god's done i don't want to forget it so i'm going to build up kind of a fortress around this this is god this is all of god it's all over all there ever be of god that's where you're wrong because god keeps moving forward it keeps moving this fountain that just keeps flowing and you don't want to stop that and by the way too we live in an age of distractions this is a big problem this is a kind of a side note but all these distractions of just natural life of anything that gets between you and your time with the lord as a distraction and you just got to put that down for a while and say but you i got to remember the main thing this flower of eternal life the thing that started me in this journey in the first place when i came to eternal life just never stop that keep that growing keep that moving so he runs back and says in here we find all kinds of materials and he picks up a stone and he said i'll go take this and show the people what kind of a stone this mountain is made out of so i can find the way back to it and he started out the door and the flyer said for the final time you have forgot the main thing and he said oh shut up see he didn't want to hear anymore forgot the main things he ran out the door and he said the doors closed behind him the flower on the inside the man the main thing was the flower like peter said when he got on that mountain transfiguration and lord he saw the lord there and moses and elijah said let's build three tabernacles you know we want to kind of set up shop here you know build a denomination but no the main thing is the eternal life and then the next slide please same sermon just a little bit further down he was the transmitter he said he that heareth my word believeth on him that sent me has eternal life verily i say unto you he hears my word believeth on him that sent me hath eternal life now the word went from a transmitter said one day verily i say unto you if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you said and come to pass you can have what you've said now if you just be the station to pick that up by some control on the inside faith and move right into the cycle of god the new birth and be born again then you'll always be in contact hear that voice i always warn you and the danger is alone when things are wrong things going wrong always be warning you and then instead of somebody being like that rich young boy or speaking of be like be man like apostle peter or paul somebody that wants the one souls for christ all right now brother branham also talks about open flues and the greatest battle ever fought and i'm still basically on the same subject it's just i'm so i'm just talking about these channels of daily bible reading prayer but i'm still you know it's it's similar to what brother branham is talking about because the our mind is a womb and we have to solve that word down it's a very natural thing so that the supernatural intake can take place it's just simply daily by reading prayer to sow down the word so there's something there for god to quicken okay i don't know how any other process that it can take place by unless you just really sew it down good in your field and make yourself ready and then god will come quick in it so god will heal you right in this atmosphere of the holy ghost where he has sent you god will give it to you just believe it amen open up them flues of the soul body senses conscience and let's let and just let god's word penetrate first take that mind okay there is the battleground not say well if i could feel it if i'd feel the glory of god falling over that's nothing to do with it not a thing but that is the glory of god i mean that is part of it that is actually god okay he's not saying that wasn't god doing that the anointings and all those things i love that i spend time like i said a while ago every time every night part of my what i do when i drive the truck is praise and worship god and i feel his presence comes so near i feel like i need to jump out of the truck you know i just don't feel like i'm deserved to be anywhere near him but that's part of it but that's not my new birth see that's not that's not my new birth that's part of my experience but that's not my new birth open that mind up that's the battleground there's where the battle sets in array right here on the front line your mind open it up and say every doubt i doubt my doubt say man i'm doubting my doubts i believe in god's word here i come saying something's going to take place then now matthew 7 these are scriptures y'all are real familiar with i'm sure i don't need to i'm just going to run through these ask and it shall be given to you seeking you shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for everyone that asks you to receive and he that seeketh findeth to him that knocketh that shall be opened we're knocking at the door whenever we're praying and reading our bible and listening to sermons that's us knocking at the door and you know matthew 6 33 is what this all based on seek you first the kingdom of god and all these things we added unto you so next slide i'm just gonna take those six things that i mentioned earlier and just show y'all a quick scripture for each of these a couple of quotes and scriptures on these read the bible second timothy two studies show thyself approved a workman that needs not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth and then pray pray without ceasing first thessalonians 5 1 timothy 2 i will therefore that men pray everywhere lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting brother branham said in the prophet elisha you don't watch you let down your prayer life you say well i'm a christian that's all the more sign you ought to pray more than ever read the bible every day pray every day don't make any decision too harshly too quickly without first considering god about it i used to like this radio program i listened to years ago and it was a radio announcer i guess you could call him on there that his voice stuck with me over all the years it echoes through my mind every once in a while he says we all need our daily dose of the word of god does anybody know who that was brother louise on the eagle crowd radio man gave you so listen that has echoed all these years through my mind we all need our daily dose of the word of god i'll just think about that because i saw her at least back there but that's so true it it rings true and i'll always always remember that listen to and read the sermons that's the next one yeah romans 10 so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god come to church and fellowship hebrews hebrews 10 and let us consider one another provoke unto love and to good works you know iron sharpens iron you know we need one another in fellowship constantly to kind of push each other and kind of encourage one another in the lord not forsaken assembling ourselves together as a man or some is exhorting one another and so much more as you see the day approaching okay making sure i'm not getting over on my time meditate philippians 4 this is my really my favorite scripture be careful and if you look up what that means in the original greek be careful careful means anxious okay anxiety we push out the anxiety that's one of those logs that gets in the river right before paul talks about this what i call the meditation scripture this is our format for meditation i think on these things and all the things in red there true honest just pure lovely good report virtue if there be any praise and think on these things he tells us basically get this log out of the way before you can do this before you can meditate on these things get that anxious log out of the way out of your river because it'll stop up the flow every time don't be so anxious no anxiety just no no fear just push all that out of the way and then you just sit and relax and just meditate on the things you've heard worship ephesians 5 and be not drunk with wine where in his excess but be filled with the spirit speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the lord even thanks always for the things unto god and father in the name of our lord jesus christ submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of god colossians 3 let the word of christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching admonishing one another psalms and hymns and spiritual songs but and then psalm 22 but thou art holy oh thou that inhabit us the praises of israel one thing about it if you want god to come around you you start praising him and he'll come inhabit your praises he still does that across the mystery of god revealed and i don't know if i'm going to go all the way through this one or not what happened in the pre-figure now he opened adam's side and took part of his flesh which was adam to make eve the bride has to be the word for he is the word she cannot stand on crease she cannot stand a nomination she stands on she can't stand on good behavior she has to stand alone on the word she was a part of it she was taken from christ here's the part i want to get to that highlighted part outside of that you're lost don't care how good you are or what your relationship or what your fellowship is your organization you're lost outside of that word being in you if you abide in me and my word in you that's what you will and be given because you are the word are the same you and the word are the same next one okay all right go on to the next slide this one's um everybody's familiar with the story of titanic i'm just going to tell a couple little stories for illustration so i can't find where he said this but i know i've heard it on documentary once upon a time so i'm going to just paraphrase it before the titanic set sail you all know that this man this captain smith was a very uh he had a long a long career of sailing in ships you know and i think practically no accidents to speak of and i think he was quoted as saying something like basically my career has been uneventful i haven't had any major no sinkings no wrecks or anything so in his mind you know he had to be built up in pride a little bit haughty it sounded like the way he made these comments and he expected this last of his voyages i think it was supposed to be the one he was going to retire on and he expected it to be no no different you know just like all the rest is it's just flawless and not to mention all the pride surrounding that whole entire voyage everybody talking about that ship being the unsinkable titanic and then look what it did went out there to see and sunk and killed 1500 people i think so the point is pride goes before a fall complacency is a killer he was going out there to the sea with this mentality that everything's going to be just the same as it was before and me as the truck driver i've i've driven well over a million miles and for over the last 14 years and every night i still bound my head and pray and say lord give me trial and mercies and help me to concentrate and and pay close attention to where i'm going and what i'm doing and then i'm very thoughtful and careful and prayerful the whole night driving because i don't care how many trips i've had without incident or accident you know this could be the next one the very next trip could be the one where i kill somebody with that tractor trailer same thing with flying planes you're never really done i heard a pilot say this one time i don't care how many hundreds of hours you've got of safe flying this next flight could be your fatal flight you could make a wrong mistake and crash and you're playing is there another flight after that no that's it i'm not done though just have a story uh some of y'all know my dad passed away this time last year and i want to tell you all quickly about him that early on in his life hey first of all he went to columbia bible college in south carolina that's where he and my mom met and he was a real godly man really seeking god really loved the lord he played all these instruments and he used his talent for the lord and one of the things he did that was so striking to me this just goes to show you how close he was to god at one time that he would take his guitar out in the woods at that college campus and he would sing and play to the lord and he wanted god's guidance on who to marry and he had two women in mind one of them was my mom and then some other woman he had them wrote down on like a notepad and went out there at the woods to praise and worship the lord just hammering a guitar set that notepad down and he said now lord show me which one you want me to marry and the name that uh one of them was my mom deborah mccarthy and after a little while of him praising the lord then the sun shone down through the trees and lit on that name deborah mccarthy and here i am well years past my my mom and dad they always raise us up to serve the lord go to church we read the bible as a family we prayed together church every sunday as you know in the baptist church and when i was about 15 i went to my own baptist church my sister went to hers and my mom kept going to church but dad stopped going maybe he missed one sunday and then two then three and he finally became complacent and he just said i'm just not going to go and he quit on the church well over the next 20 years or so of his life i watched everything just fall apart his prayer life his i mean his you know spiritually emotionally relationally physically financially and every other way and at the end of his life i was worried about his salvation and i went to him and talked with him my sister talked with him my brother-in-law we all went in our own different ways and we had a dad called us together for a meeting and he wanted to know he said what do you all think of me spiritually now he basically came right out want to know about his spiritual condition he said do y'all think i'm job and i said dad i'm going to be real blunt job was a righteous man he was being tested god allowed him to be tested because he was a righteous man you've got away from the lord and i don't know after that exactly where that went with him and that was between him and the lord and i pray and hope that god got a hold of him there because october 25th my birthday last year he sent me a message and it was the last time and i i think it was a text and i didn't get back to him in time and from there on out he was incoherent and he passed away it was november 7th i believe he passed away but you know his whole life everybody's life tells a story you know everyone in the bible the kings you know there's some that say this king was good and kings and chronicles this one was good and things went well he prospered lived long and god blessed him and this one king came and he was an evil king and he died not being desired and he was stricken with a incurable disease and all those type of things if you will just keep seeking god never become complacent you know god will continue to fall pour out his blessings on you but just never stop never think you know enough and you've like brother white said recently i've got enough tenure in the message you've been here long enough that you just can sit back and relax if you've got breath in your lungs and you've still got time you still need to see god more you never stop seeking god and i guess i'll make one more closing comment um this occurred to me recently i've been thinking about this a lot i started reading my bible every day when i was 15 in the baptist church i never missed a day of it in the last almost 22 years tomorrow makes 22 years or so since i started that it's no wonder that though i was struggling early in my christian journey with pornography and profanity it's ironic really to think about this but the law of god caused sanctification it already started working in me because at age 15 i started reading my bible every day and about six months later i overcame pornography about a year later overcame profanity my last bad word left my mouth and there's not been a relapse in over 20 years that's supernatural it's not suppressing that wasn't me suppressing it they have no more desire to do any of those things not a bit and it just goes to show you if you just follow this simple law of god i don't look down on anyone for you know pornography profanity smoking drinking cussing or anything but if you find those things in your life i guarantee it if you'll just read the bible pray every day never stop that eventually those things will go away you keep resisting the devil he'll flee but just keep this maintain this if you forget everything else maintain christ brother branham said if i whether i maintain my car my house my marriage or whatever let me maintain christ and that's gonna be it uh musicians come god bless y'all [Applause] you
