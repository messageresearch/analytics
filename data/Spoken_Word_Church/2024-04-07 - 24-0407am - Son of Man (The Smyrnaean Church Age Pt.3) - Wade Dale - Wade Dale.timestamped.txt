[22:29] amen so now real quick we'll U we're
[22:33] going to go to part three and we'll talk
[22:35] a little bit about some of the
[22:37] salutation that God told them in the
[22:40] saman church age which samna means what
[22:43] bitter and have we not been in a more
[22:46] bitter age everybody's bitter with
[22:49] everybody nobody's happy with nobody
[22:52] everybody wants their day everybody
[22:54] wants their time it's all a me me me Le
[22:57] a church but that was seeds of it though
[23:00] back there in Ephesus Smyrna all the way
[23:03] up cuz brother R said we get all the
[23:04] curses and the blessings of each age
[23:08] Revelations 1:10 says I was in the
[23:10] spirit on the Lord's day and heard
[23:11] behind me a great voice as of a trumpet
[23:14] saying I am Alpha and Omega the first
[23:16] and the last you see how he kept that
[23:18] brother collie read that way over in
[23:19] Revelations 20s something that he's
[23:21] still telling you he's Alpha and Omega
[23:24] the first and the last and what thou see
[23:26] us right in the book which we know John
[23:28] did to the churches and he turned to see
[23:30] the voice and when he turned to see The
[23:31] Voice he saw in other words he saw the
[23:34] whole Gentile dispensation right there
[23:36] in front of him all right he saw the
[23:39] whole thing and he saw somebody standing
[23:41] in the midst of that Gentile
[23:43] dispensation called the Lord Jesus
[23:45] called the son of man and in the midst
[23:47] of the seven candlesticks one liken to
[23:49] the son of man clothed with a garment
[23:50] down to the foot and G about the PS with
[23:53] a golden girdle you can be seated Lord
[23:55] add his Blessing to the reading of the
[23:57] word he saw Christ in what bride form so
[24:00] the bride form is what we're looking at
[24:02] All Through the Ages there was a bride
[24:04] in every Church age everybody had a
[24:07] portion of word that they came to same
[24:11] way with us
[24:13] here and he had in his right hand Seven
[24:15] Stars Revelations one and out of his
[24:17] mouth one a sharp two-edged sword he had
[24:20] those things who who do he have in his
[24:22] hand he had those seven Messengers and
[24:23] we talking about uh the last few weeks
[24:26] how that is a specific message to a
[24:28] specific one person not a group not a
[24:31] council but to one person and that one
[24:35] person delivered that message and
[24:37] sometimes that person wasn't around for
[24:39] the whole of the of the church age they
[24:41] were taken out off the scene and we'll
[24:44] look at some of that in just a few
[24:45] minutes about how God does that and he
[24:47] allows that to happen because you get
[24:50] looking at the messenger too
[24:53] much and don't look at the message you
[24:56] get to look at the messenger and you
[24:57] don't see the message behind that and
[25:01] it's listen God's not a respector of
[25:03] persons but he does use people to speak
[25:05] to you now what you respond and you do
[25:08] with it's your business all right but he
[25:11] is going to send seven men he's going to
[25:13] send seven people and that like I always
[25:15] said before if if we're looking for
[25:18] another Prophet God's got to send us one
[25:19] if brother Baron wasn't it God's got to
[25:21] send us one cuz he said he send us seven
[25:24] he sent us six for sure I know we he
[25:27] sent us seven
[25:28] but some people are questioning that and
[25:30] I believe that they're not going to find
[25:32] all they're going to find is is they're
[25:34] going to find if they're not born again
[25:35] they're going to find the Antichrist
[25:38] they're going to find their Superman
[25:40] that's going to try to take them
[25:41] somewhere but it's going to take them to
[25:43] hell not take them to Heaven all right
[25:45] this whole age is a age of deception
[25:48] this whole age is we've come to the Apex
[25:51] or the uh uh the very part of God that's
[25:54] supposed to be
[25:56] revealed and we see gross Darkness yeah
[25:59] we see Darkness on every hand we see
[26:01] everything going on that's just like
[26:03] what the president did the other day you
[26:05] know about um having a day of
[26:07] transgender for transgender people I
[26:10] think you ought to have a day of
[26:13] Christians they're going to make a day
[26:15] and Proclaim something have a have a day
[26:17] for Christians to to go to church and
[26:19] not have to go to work and get paid for
[26:21] it praise the Lord
[26:24] anyhow well that's what they
[26:26] do all right Revelations 2:8 says to the
[26:30] angel of the church in Smyrna right
[26:32] these things sayith the first and the
[26:34] last which was dead and is alive that's
[26:36] kind of strange this whole scripture is
[26:38] really strange if you read
[26:40] it because remember we start out alive
[26:42] and we die whoever this was started out
[26:45] dead and now he's alive all right I Know
[26:48] Thy Works in Tribulation and poverty but
[26:50] thou rich now it says I know but it
[26:52] didn't say I'm going to do something
[26:53] about it we'll read it in just a minute
[26:56] and I know the blast me blasphemy of
[26:59] them which say they are Jews and are not
[27:01] but are the synagogue not of the
[27:03] synagogue they are literally Satan
[27:05] walking around on two feet just as you
[27:08] and I are by the baptism of the Holy
[27:11] Ghost you and I are God walking around
[27:13] in two feet we are the synagogue of God
[27:16] if you're born again today he's not
[27:19] looking for another Temple he's not
[27:20] looking for another building he's
[27:21] looking for
[27:23] you amen a body yes sir thou has
[27:28] prepared
[27:30] me and are not but are the synagogue of
[27:32] Satan fear not fear none of those things
[27:36] which Thou shalt suffer behold the devil
[27:38] shall cast some of you into prison that
[27:39] you may be tried hadn't come to that yet
[27:42] have we but they did and ye shall have
[27:45] tribulation 10 days be thou faithful
[27:47] unto death and I will give thee a Crown
[27:49] of Life he that out ear let him hear
[27:51] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[27:54] he that overcometh shall not be hurt of
[27:56] the second death if you're born again
[27:59] today there's no such thing as a second
[28:01] death you die here all right we die here
[28:05] all right we're going to have a death
[28:06] bear on Resurrection
[28:10] outside there won't be a second
[28:14] death for those of you that don't know
[28:16] what a second death is if you die in
[28:20] Christ you fall asleep you come up in
[28:24] Resurrection you don't die no more all
[28:27] right now if you're a sinner you die
[28:30] natural
[28:31] death right you're in a dimension all
[28:35] right so that's one death so you you die
[28:38] see now we died if we go by the grave
[28:40] you you die when you resurrect when a
[28:43] Christian resurrects he'll never die
[28:45] again amen death has been destroyed
[28:48] absolutely all right but now a sinner
[28:50] though he dies physically then he goes
[28:53] to a dimension all right then he comes
[28:55] out of that dimension on the day of
[28:58] judgment and then he can die a second
[29:01] death if he's not given eternal life all
[29:03] right and so it says here that you're
[29:05] protected or you'll not be hurt of the
[29:08] second death if you hear what the spirit
[29:10] says to that church and that
[29:15] overcometh all right remember we're in a
[29:17] battle not a picnic that's right
[29:18] Battleship not a cruise ship okay and
[29:21] the old ship isign it looks bad but it's
[29:23] going to get us into the shore we know
[29:27] that so there was an announcement in
[29:29] heaven so God has all this plan I was
[29:32] thinking about the other day you know we
[29:34] can't fathom a man standing
[29:38] anywhere nothing going on no a no no no
[29:43] world and his thoughts are the very
[29:46] expression of his can't change and once
[29:49] he speaks them they're
[29:52] Eternal once he speaks them they just
[29:54] continually keep going you and I we have
[29:56] a thought y'all had one a few minutes
[29:57] ago it's gone or either you're still
[30:00] thinking about it now but it will leave
[30:03] and you know what most of us that are
[30:05] over
[30:06] 60 I'm going to say 50 are going to
[30:09] forget what we just thought a few
[30:10] minutes ago
[30:12] anyway all right but God doesn't
[30:14] everything he thinks it materializes all
[30:17] right and listen and I believe that the
[30:20] word of God if it's spoken brother Brown
[30:22] said on lips of clay but there is a
[30:27] spirit behind it not a spirit of man but
[30:29] the spirit of God behind it brother
[30:31] Brown said that's as deity speaking so
[30:34] as the word Goes Forth if the word Goes
[30:36] Forth and it's number one 100% true
[30:39] that's God speaking yes sir okay that's
[30:42] not man that's God speaking cuz that's
[30:44] what he did with Paul irenius Martin
[30:47] Columba that's why I can depend on God
[30:51] sending us a
[30:53] prophet that caught the mind of God not
[30:56] the mind of a denomination of the the
[30:59] mind of a
[31:00] counsel or the mind of another preacher
[31:03] come on Paul tells us I've read it to
[31:06] you three times he says I didn't receive
[31:08] this of
[31:09] man I didn't go to college I'm sure he
[31:12] went to college but remember he said
[31:14] everything he counted from his
[31:16] conversion backwards
[31:18] was dung he was pretty adamant about
[31:22] that he could have said anything else
[31:24] but he said it was just Dum something
[31:25] you to throw out don't touch it get rid
[31:28] of it that's what he did because what he
[31:31] caught the mind of God well each one of
[31:32] these Messengers even irenius caught the
[31:35] mind of God and brought a message
[31:38] brother brandom CAU a mind of God and
[31:40] brought us a message amen and then that
[31:43] Mind Of God is now what transferred into
[31:45] my and your soul soul
[31:50] amen not your spirit realm not your
[31:55] flesh you're very being that's right
[31:58] the soul that God give
[32:00] you and then Paul yielded
[32:03] itself can you do the same thing I know
[32:06] we talk about Paul
[32:07] irenius people have problems with us
[32:10] calling you know people's names well I
[32:13] mean we going to talk about this
[32:16] afternoon what's in a
[32:18] name a name is your persona a name is
[32:21] who you are I can say father who of
[32:23] y'all in here are father well you know
[32:25] 18 or 20 of you hold your hands up
[32:28] right but when I say Aaron Roberts
[32:31] nobody holds their hands up except
[32:33] Aaron all right I can say father you
[32:37] father I'm a
[32:39] son I have a spirit
[32:43] right but who am I what's in your name
[32:46] that's why Jesus told us adamantly
[32:49] baptize in the
[32:50] name of the father and of the son and of
[32:53] the Holy Ghost hiding it from the wise
[32:55] and prudent know it listen God knew they
[32:59] was going to take that false
[33:00] baptism amen it didn't surprise him he
[33:05] knew they would building and we'll look
[33:06] at it this afternoon and we'll talk
[33:08] about water baptism this afternoon we
[33:09] did it about a year ago but we'll
[33:11] revisit it today because we're having
[33:13] baptismal service but the father son
[33:16] Holy Ghost
[33:18] baptism why didn't the disciples just
[33:20] jump right in and start baptizing in the
[33:22] name of the father and of the son and of
[33:23] the Holy Ghost well they
[33:25] did right well they did
[33:29] we can't have a versus here you like
[33:32] good versus bad we can't have a versus
[33:34] we can't have a Matthew 28 19 versus act
[33:37] 238 they saying the same thing one is
[33:40] actually complimenting the other it's a
[33:42] revelation that Peter got of what Jesus
[33:45] was saying and Jesus wasn't up in heaven
[33:47] going no no Peter that's not what I
[33:50] said he actually anointed what Peter
[33:54] said by giving them the Holy Ghost 3,000
[33:57] downstairs were baptized and received
[34:00] the baptism of the holy ghost in One Day
[34:02] One Shot identifying that that name was
[34:07] very important right so as we call Paul
[34:09] irenius Martin the different ones we
[34:12] don't listen the world don't have a
[34:13] problem quoting Billy
[34:15] Graham they don't have a problem saying
[34:17] or or Wert said or or as as um Ryan was
[34:21] saying
[34:23] Spurgeon
[34:26] Moody just put your whatever in there
[34:30] Roberts you know or Roberts different
[34:33] one you can say those names and they
[34:35] like oh yeah yeah we know that but when
[34:37] you say William brandom they go
[34:39] oh put too much on that man you quote
[34:42] him way too
[34:47] much no I'll promise you one
[34:51] thing if we're
[34:53] quoting what he
[34:55] said and it's the truth
[34:58] it's not William Brandon we're
[35:01] quoting it's God absolutely we're
[35:05] quoting but he used a filter called a
[35:08] man and a man's got to have a
[35:11] name right and Bible says Apostles
[35:14] prophets pastors teachers and
[35:15] evangelists there's names behind that
[35:17] yes sir there's people's names all the
[35:20] way down from the time Paul wrote it
[35:22] till now there's names associated with
[35:26] all that like I said the Billy Graham
[35:28] movement the or Roberts movement the
[35:30] Dwight Moody movement brother BR said
[35:32] Dwight Moody put millions in in
[35:35] heaven don't mind quoting him don't mind
[35:38] quoting
[35:39] Spurgeon but quote William brandom
[35:43] and be
[35:45] careful no if you're quoting him you're
[35:48] quoting what God
[35:50] Said same way with Moody and Cal any of
[35:52] those that quote the word of God and
[35:54] give you a a a revelation brother G me a
[35:59] revelation he didn't give me a new God
[36:03] him he showed me the God is already
[36:05] there more
[36:07] clear he gave us a way for the spirit to
[36:09] move freely on cuz it has not moved
[36:12] freely we get into this third Church
[36:15] ages when when Satan starts clamping
[36:17] down on the word of
[36:19] God the first age the second age not so
[36:22] much they were free they had the lion l
[36:25] i o n the lion anointing and they were
[36:27] bold and they they were they were going
[36:29] out into the world and preaching the
[36:31] gospel signs and wonders were following
[36:33] them but when you get into the Third
[36:34] Church age you get into the fourth
[36:36] Church age it's nothing but Darkness
[36:38] it's nothing but death that was the
[36:40] years of Dark Ages right Satan had come
[36:43] in and crept in and he had clamped down
[36:45] listen he didn't do away with churches
[36:49] right he just moved in
[36:51] them just like right here the synagogue
[36:54] of Satan not in the synagogue you are
[36:56] the synagogue of Satan listen if you're
[36:58] not born again today you are the
[36:59] synagogue of
[37:02] Satan so there's an announcement in
[37:06] heaven out of the mind of God comes a
[37:08] logos a sealed up message is open we've
[37:10] been through this before so we'll go
[37:11] through real quick try to get done here
[37:13] in about 15 minutes so a trumpet sounds
[37:16] there's a message proclaimed listen
[37:18] we've lived through this so we ought to
[37:19] be able to say Amen to all this cuz
[37:22] we're living through
[37:23] that we're living through a message that
[37:26] we got to l 00 sermons we've got video
[37:30] we've got audio we've got the written
[37:33] word and signs and wonders following him
[37:35] in uh William bram's ministry right and
[37:39] and we know that it was the voice of God
[37:41] in our day
[37:42] yes but it was really hard for them to
[37:45] see that because there wasn't everything
[37:47] written down there wasn't audio they
[37:49] didn't have an Internet that fa most of
[37:51] the
[37:53] time it's not anybody's fault but the
[37:56] internet service but the devil
[37:58] he goes out there and plays in that box
[38:01] right out that door right
[38:03] there we're going to put a prayer Club
[38:05] put a prayer cloth out there in that box
[38:08] we're going to put a prayer cloth out
[38:09] there remind myself note to self put a
[38:14] prayer cloth in that box it goes into
[38:15] there I it may not be it may be they
[38:17] always say it's out there never it's us
[38:20] so but we going to send that prayer
[38:22] cloth backwards amen we're going to send
[38:24] it up the pole we're not going to climb
[38:26] up there all right but we'll send it
[38:28] back we'll do that after service is over
[38:31] thank you Lord for reminding me of that
[38:34] so there's a trumpet sound you have
[38:35] heard you are under the last Messengers
[38:38] trumpet sounding and he's continuing to
[38:41] sound
[38:43] yes and it's a distinct message and a
[38:46] declared message and the reason they
[38:47] hate brother brandom is cuz he's not out
[38:49] he's not
[38:53] normal are you and I
[38:56] normal Paul says in a way that's called
[38:58] heresy do I serve God crazy the world
[39:02] looks at us and says you don't do what
[39:05] right you you you do
[39:10] what don't they do that when you tell
[39:12] somebody something and it's kind of you
[39:14] know not of the norm and they go y'all
[39:16] really do that yeah we really do
[39:20] that like Mama's doctor she goes to she
[39:24] said oh y'all believe all the Bible you
[39:26] know what every Christian ought to
[39:28] believe all the
[39:32] Bible as old black man said from kber to
[39:35] kber even the ker is Holy say holy
[39:39] Bible but look there's a spiritual war
[39:41] and that's what we're fighting right now
[39:43] it's a spiritual war that Warfare is
[39:45] going on inside of us pulling us one way
[39:49] or the other True Word of God versus
[39:52] false Doctrine all right now remember
[39:55] one thing's for sure God has never had
[39:56] in his mind false
[39:59] Doctrine inside of God inside of his
[40:02] eternity there is nothing false so no
[40:06] trinitarian Doctrine no father son Holy
[40:08] Ghost baptism ever come out of the mind
[40:11] of
[40:12] God it was the devil that interjected
[40:15] because he is the synagogue of Satan
[40:18] himself and he entered in and got people
[40:20] to go well he might well well surely
[40:23] Jesus wasn't God pure God because he
[40:26] cried we we saw him eat we saw him you
[40:30] know we saw him fall one day stepped
[40:33] over a roote and fell I can't be God oh
[40:36] yeah it was oh yeah it was God hiding in
[40:39] Simplicity hiding right up under their
[40:41] nose the Messiah that they were looking
[40:43] for and still looking for showed up
[40:46] 2,000 years ago all right so there's a
[40:49] spiritual war starts true versus false
[40:51] so then what happens is The Messengers
[40:54] laid away or taken off the Earth why is
[40:55] he taken off the Earth so you quit
[40:58] looking at the
[41:00] messenger and remember that that
[41:02] messenger is a messenger from God he
[41:05] lives such a holy life to sometimes you
[41:08] might not be able to tell the
[41:13] difference Paul said don't baptize in my
[41:15] name brother R said don't baptize in my
[41:17] name
[41:19] right so you got to separated so God
[41:22] lays away the
[41:23] messenger takes that message and pours
[41:26] it into a group of people amen amen to
[41:28] fulfill the Bible absolutely all the
[41:31] Bible not to listen we can say God sent
[41:33] a prophet and we can go
[41:36] home we'll come back next Sunday and
[41:38] about 500 more Sundays and we'll just
[41:40] say God sent a prophet and go back home
[41:43] but God sent a message to progress past
[41:46] that God sent a prophet that he sent a
[41:48] message behind that Prophet with that
[41:51] Prophet to a group of
[41:53] people by the Holy Ghost by the word of
[41:57] God nothing
[41:58] else right so that messenger's laid away
[42:01] or taken off the earth look people
[42:04] either accepted or reject it and what
[42:06] happened same way with brother Brandon
[42:07] we can see all these types perfectly
[42:09] same way with Paul they accepted or
[42:11] rejected it and it brings a judgment or
[42:14] a plague spiritual death to the ones who
[42:15] reject their messenger till the next age
[42:18] comes back the same way but now remember
[42:19] you and I are not that way we don't have
[42:21] a going up and then falling off and then
[42:24] there's
[42:25] another listen we're fixing to have
[42:27] Eclipse here pretty quick
[42:29] right full
[42:33] blackout praise the
[42:36] Lord because you and I are the only brid
[42:38] is
[42:40] left and they can hide it all they want
[42:43] to but behind it that Moon's still
[42:46] shining that Moon's still there that
[42:48] Moon didn't go away it's lost a little
[42:50] bit of its light have we lost a little
[42:52] bit of our love you know like the first
[42:53] church age have we lost our first love
[42:55] have we lost that light that that that
[42:57] gave us fervor to get up and come to
[42:59] church that gave us fervor as as as
[43:01] brother um Ryan was saying this morning
[43:04] to read a little
[43:05] more study a little more that's our
[43:08] challenge to study a little more just
[43:10] read a little more get rid of some of
[43:12] the stuff that we pick up our time
[43:17] with that was wonderful brother Ryan I
[43:20] appreciate
[43:22] that first
[43:24] love age of Pentecost was the first
[43:27] First Age it come up ad30 the messenger
[43:29] was the Holy Ghost we'll continue
[43:30] through real quick the alpha age was the
[43:32] Ephesian Church age remember Paul was
[43:34] the messenger he founded it in 53 died
[43:38] in in' 64 to 67 so he wasn't around for
[43:42] half of his church age either but thank
[43:45] God somebody picked that thing up and
[43:48] carried it on to the next Church age so
[43:52] the next Church age is we look and see
[43:55] we we'll look at the picture in a minute
[43:56] but remember we were talking about the
[43:58] porter you got to enter in by the door
[44:01] and you don't know what's behind that
[44:02] door except there'd be a porter there or
[44:05] someone to uh concierge or somebody to
[44:08] take you behind that door and tell you
[44:10] where all the rooms are and that's what
[44:11] brother random did he didn't create a
[44:13] motel the word of God he didn't create
[44:16] the word of God he just showed you where
[44:18] everything was at he showed you all the
[44:20] doors that now all the doors are open
[44:22] yes none of them are locked up man
[44:24] didn't go in there and lock them up no
[44:25] God opened them all up the great
[44:27] Shepherd that's the one we follow the
[44:29] great Shepherd that great shepherd He
[44:32] says look you'll hear his voice and a
[44:34] stranger you'll not follow why how in
[44:37] the world could you listen to this
[44:39] message and listen to the prophet of God
[44:40] pour his heart out and listen to
[44:42] preachers that have preached for 25 and
[44:44] 30 years and then
[44:47] leave and never listen to that voice
[44:50] again now see to me and you you look
[44:52] everybody's
[44:54] going because you're not that way
[44:58] you love the voice of God you love the
[45:00] voice of God in the end time you love
[45:02] what this message does for us and to
[45:05] turn that thing away you never really
[45:06] got the message inside of you you might
[45:08] have got the messenger but you didn't
[45:10] get the message and listen brother Brown
[45:12] didn't save us
[45:13] Soul Jesus Christ is the only one in the
[45:16] saving business now somebody take you to
[45:19] him but he's the one that saves that's
[45:22] right and a stranger you not follow and
[45:25] then we look at the church ages we see
[45:26] them real quick quick we got a
[45:27] Pentecostal age you got Paul coming at
[45:29] the end of Pentecost bringing his
[45:32] message and then God sent an irenius in
[45:34] the overlap to what pick up the one pick
[45:37] up the what Paul had and add to it all
[45:42] right come
[45:44] on God's always
[45:46] moving all right God's always moving he
[45:49] moved right into irenius and then when
[45:50] he moved into irus there was a great man
[45:53] in the lap over and now remember in that
[45:56] lap over where brother says we'll go
[45:57] through it real
[45:59] quick every evil that was in the first
[46:02] church age lapped over in the next age
[46:03] so this is kind of like a chain linked
[46:07] together all right cuz remember and what
[46:10] does brother R always say that the chain
[46:12] is only strong as it's what weakest link
[46:15] all right well there was some we weak
[46:17] links got in to the church and broke
[46:20] Fellowship broke Doctrine broke the word
[46:23] of God apart and now what did Brother
[46:26] Brown say the last messenger would do he
[46:28] would tie up the loose ends in other
[46:30] words put that chain back together amen
[46:33] by the word of
[46:35] God and thank God cuz we accepted it
[46:37] we're recipients of that we're the recip
[46:40] recipients of this whole
[46:42] thing just keep going on down till it
[46:44] finally ends and complete apostasy in
[46:46] the last day if it was the synagogue of
[46:48] Satan in the second age you can very
[46:50] well say that that's the same thing
[46:52] happening in this age all
[46:55] right so the lap overs of Grace of the
[46:58] people the messenger was Paul so let's
[47:02] get on to because we know Paul like I
[47:04] said before Paul
[47:06] said the gospel which was preached to me
[47:09] is not after man for I neither received
[47:10] it of man neither was I taught it but by
[47:13] the revelation of Jesus Christ can we
[47:15] say that with brother
[47:17] brandham you have to say that with every
[47:19] messenger because Paul was the pattern
[47:21] if Paul was a pattern then that's it all
[47:24] right then he told him he wouldn't see
[47:27] no
[47:27] more now let's get to the Smyrna age
[47:30] let's get to the the meaning of Smyrna
[47:33] is bitter it comes from the word m sm
[47:37] all right which is used in embalming the
[47:39] dead remember they brought gold
[47:40] frankincense and myrr to Jesus showing
[47:43] deity dedicated to death all right so
[47:45] the Smur and church age now watch
[47:47] brother BR he says thus we have a
[47:48] two-fold
[47:50] significance found in the name of this
[47:52] age it was a bitter age filled with
[47:54] death the two Vines within the framework
[47:56] of the Church were drifting further
[47:58] apart with an increased bitterness
[48:00] toward the True Vine in the part of the
[48:02] FX and see that's what I see in the end
[48:04] time now is bitterness people are
[48:07] bitter people are bitter you go talk to
[48:09] people they're bitter and and we get
[48:11] bitter
[48:13] sometimes am we get bitter when gas is
[48:16] 299 or whatever it is
[48:20] 349 Bread's $4 a low for it used to be
[48:23] two eggs is a dollar used to be $149 now
[48:27] we get bitter because we blame it on
[48:29] somebody
[48:30] else
[48:34] right it's like uh brother Ryan was
[48:37] talking this morning that root of
[48:38] bitterness will will get in if you let
[48:41] it and it'll tear you apart so the two
[48:45] Vines within the framework of the church
[48:46] were drifting further apart with an
[48:48] increased bitterness toward the True
[48:49] Vine on part of the false death was not
[48:52] only the seed of the false Vine but even
[48:54] in the True Vine even in the True Vine
[48:58] there was a creeping paralysis and
[49:01] impotence because they had already
[49:03] drifted from the unadulterated truth of
[49:05] the first few years after Pentecost now
[49:09] watch this and no True Believer is any
[49:12] stronger and spiritually healthy and
[49:15] Alive than his knowledge of and
[49:17] adherence to the pure word of God that's
[49:20] that takes all the emotion out that
[49:22] takes all the other stuff out you take
[49:24] all that back and just throw it away
[49:26] amen it's spiritual health is what we're
[49:28] looking at all right the inward man yes
[49:32] spiritual health and adherence to the
[49:34] pure word of God
[49:37] absolutely that's seen by multitudes in
[49:39] examples in the Old
[49:41] Testament organizations all everybody
[49:43] wanted to
[49:45] organize look what happened to Israel
[49:47] when they went into captivity they went
[49:48] having they had a priesthood a temple in
[49:50] the word of God when they came back they
[49:52] had rabbis theological order of
[49:54] Pharisees the sa he's talking about all
[49:55] the way down to brother to Jesus and
[49:57] when Jesus came they were so far off he
[49:59] called them of their father the devil
[50:02] they were so far off that's what
[50:04] happened in every Church age we got the
[50:07] true absolutely but there's a false that
[50:09] stuck with it
[50:14] though Satan don't want to be out there
[50:17] it wants to be right
[50:19] here yes sir so the age started about
[50:22] 170 ad to ad 312 the messenger was
[50:26] irenius he was born at 130 ad and died
[50:29] in 202 so he died right in the middle of
[50:32] his church age pretty much at the at the
[50:33] front of it and there was several
[50:35] hundred years that somebody had to take
[50:37] the message and move it forward all
[50:40] right he was the disciple of polycarp
[50:44] and we know we saw I I read you what
[50:45] happened to polycarp he was really truly
[50:47] a saint he was he was called of God to
[50:50] do what he's supposed to do but he had
[50:52] one little thing against him he leaned
[50:54] toward organized religion and God hated
[50:57] that he hates nickis you God ha yeah God
[51:00] hates sorry about that but he
[51:02] does you know God repented one time for
[51:05] making
[51:07] man God repented for he said that in the
[51:10] Bible he repented for making man and
[51:13] knowing what man would do when he put us
[51:15] in flesh but he still was like
[51:19] man how can y'all get off that
[51:23] bad yet for all this great testimony
[51:27] the student of John the Revelator was
[51:28] not militant against the nician system
[51:30] he's talking about polycart for he
[51:32] himself leaned toward organization not
[51:35] realizing now if he wasn't realizing
[51:38] then what happened the
[51:40] devil the
[51:44] devil give him a false
[51:48] Doctrine God
[51:51] didn't for he himself leaned toward
[51:53] organization not realizing that the
[51:55] desire of fellowship and what appeared
[51:57] was a good plan to Foster the work of
[51:59] God was really a trick of the
[52:04] enemy deception is not horrible if you
[52:07] stay in it I mean if you if you get out
[52:09] of it deception is horrible if you stay
[52:11] in it all right let me get that right
[52:14] deception it's not bad to be deceived
[52:15] listen all of us were deceived yes
[52:19] sir and we may still be a little
[52:21] deceived
[52:22] anyway but don't stay in deception ask
[52:25] God to give you
[52:27] the true word of God like revelation we
[52:30] thrive on
[52:33] Revelation so now we know it was ireneus
[52:35] I want to show you what he did here this
[52:36] is some of his quotes I read them
[52:39] yesterday the other day Wednesday night
[52:40] but I'll read them again the glory of
[52:42] God is Man Fully Alive you ought to read
[52:44] about ireneus you can tell how God used
[52:47] this man Jesus the Incarnate Word is a
[52:50] meeting place between God and Humanity
[52:54] he wrote the book against heresies which
[52:56] is gnosticism had GN o St T you can look
[52:59] it up online gnosticism is many gods or
[53:02] a god with this over here or the trinit
[53:05] the basis of a trinitarian Doctrine amen
[53:09] of a many gods all right well he was
[53:11] against that so he wrote a book about
[53:14] it he was the disciple of AP polyart who
[53:16] was a disciple of John the Revelator and
[53:19] I was telling you before they were
[53:20] talking about the four gospels and the
[53:22] Book of mbes and all the different other
[53:24] books that were written during the time
[53:25] of Jesus and the of irenius and he just
[53:28] sat down one day and he said no he said
[53:30] the four gospels are Matthew Mark Luke
[53:32] and John and that's
[53:33] it so they accepted that and thank God
[53:36] because that the people that that I've
[53:38] got to wrote down here God picked
[53:40] irenius but he picked a he picked a
[53:42] people to respond to the characteristic
[53:45] of irenius he picked this group of
[53:49] people he picked a group of
[53:52] people to catch the revelation of the
[53:54] end time that God sent us a prophet yes
[53:58] he
[54:00] did every age is the same way sir the
[54:04] central point of Iran's theology is a
[54:06] unity and goodness of God in opposition
[54:08] to the Gnostic theory of God which is a
[54:10] number of divine
[54:12] emanations he was a student of polycarp
[54:15] we know that and he used the word
[54:18] logos John had used logos terminology in
[54:20] the Gospel of John in first John we see
[54:24] that a lot of times we think well
[54:25] brother B came up with the word logos
[54:27] now the theologians knew about the word
[54:29] logos long long time ago all right so
[54:33] let's read this real quick and then
[54:34] we'll close we get ready for
[54:36] communion unto the angel of the church
[54:38] in smrna right these things sayith the
[54:40] first the last which was dead and now
[54:42] alive dead then alive Adam was alive
[54:47] then he died whoever this is took death
[54:49] and turned it into life which is Jesus
[54:52] Christ so who's speaking to us the Lord
[54:54] Jesus himself I know th Works in
[54:57] Tribulation and poverty but they are
[54:58] rich and that's the way it is
[55:03] now you know you got the Bezos and
[55:05] different guys that you know hund and
[55:06] something billion dollars couldn't
[55:09] couldn't spend it all you could buy half
[55:11] you could buy probably half of the known
[55:13] countries in the world one person could
[55:15] buy
[55:17] it right but without the baptism of the
[55:20] Holy
[55:22] Ghost he don't even have a dollar Hall
[55:26] he don't have a dollar he don't have a
[55:27] chance to get in heaven he can't buy his
[55:30] way
[55:31] in but Thou Art rich and I know the
[55:33] blasphemy of them which say they are
[55:35] Jews and are not but are the synagogue
[55:38] of Satan let's listen to what brother
[55:40] Bram said
[55:41] here the mere Association of
[55:43] kind-hearted people with a True Believer
[55:45] might well bring death in return for
[55:48] their
[55:49] kindness the Lord God Almighty says I
[55:51] know there he is walking in the midst of
[55:53] his people there he is the chief
[55:56] Shepherd of the flock but does he hold
[55:58] back the persecution does he stem the
[56:01] tribulation no he does
[56:04] not he simply says I know your
[56:07] tribulation I am not at all unmindful of
[56:10] your suffering what a stumbling block
[56:12] this is to so many
[56:16] people you know Prosperity Doctrine and
[56:19] all those things you know everything's
[56:20] going to be peachy King and hunky dory
[56:24] and listen
[56:29] you and I know for a fact if you are an
[56:32] adult human being today look at me if
[56:35] you're an adult human being
[56:38] today
[56:40] without
[56:41] God what would you
[56:45] do without
[56:47] law what would you
[56:50] do without something to govern you what
[56:53] would you
[56:55] do H see there that's why God give
[56:59] us overcoming power that's why God gives
[57:02] us
[57:04] tribulation cuz it keeps us in
[57:07] line it keeps us looking at a higher
[57:10] power it keeps us looking at beyond what
[57:12] life is amen but just think about that
[57:16] it it would be and it's going to be a
[57:18] lawless Place could you imagine when the
[57:20] Holy Ghost comes off of this
[57:23] Earth for the battle of Armageddon they
[57:25] won't be any Holy Ghost left all the
[57:27] 144,000 to be gone the two witnesses and
[57:30] we we'd have been in glory three and A2
[57:32] years nothing no Holy Ghost nothing to
[57:36] to to put any kind of morality up here
[57:39] and that's what you bump up against
[57:41] that's right all hell is going to break
[57:43] loose that's why it's going to be an
[57:44] Armageddon that's why it's going to be a
[57:46] a button punching time right listen
[57:49] without the Holy Ghost today they kill
[57:51] each other yes
[57:53] sir don't you think the Soviet Union
[57:57] as huge as it is would have destroyed
[58:00] Ukraine by
[58:02] now don't you think all them other
[58:04] countries all get together and fight
[58:05] Israel one time Israel may not have a
[58:09] chance so what's holding it back is me
[58:11] and you the Gentile Church age is not
[58:14] over yet so none of that can happen
[58:16] there is a holy ghost on the earth there
[58:18] is as the Bible says the they hold the
[58:20] Four Winds or they hold the wars away
[58:24] from us right now there's angels yes
[58:26] amen we believe in angels
[58:29] right
[58:30] okay like Israel they wondered if God
[58:33] really loved them how can God be just
[58:35] and loving if he stands by and watches
[58:37] his people suffer this is what they ask
[58:39] in Malachi 1 1-3 the burden of the word
[58:42] of the Lord to Israel by Malachi I have
[58:45] loved you sayith the Lord yet we say
[58:47] wherein hast thou love us was not Esau
[58:49] Jacob's brother sayith the Lord yet I
[58:52] love Jacob and I hated Esau and laid his
[58:55] mountains and his hair her itage waste
[58:56] for the dragons of the Wilderness you
[58:58] see they could not figure out God's love
[59:01] everybody thinks God's love is just oh
[59:03] it's just listen God's love is what's
[59:06] going to put us in a
[59:08] place it's going to put us in a place
[59:11] where there's perfect love it's going to
[59:13] put us in a place that there's not a day
[59:15] goes by that you don't worship God and
[59:17] feel good and why that ought to makees
[59:20] that don't make dead people
[59:22] shout what a day yes
[59:26] but you can't figure out God's love
[59:28] right listen if you got the Holy Ghost
[59:31] you're getting
[59:32] there cu the love of God's corrective
[59:35] yes sir they thought that love meant no
[59:37] suffering they thought that love meant a
[59:39] baby with parental care but God said
[59:42] that his love was elective
[59:45] love the proof of his love is election
[59:48] that no matter what happened his love
[59:51] was proven truly by the fact they were
[59:54] chosen under salvation you ought thank
[59:56] God for that because God had chosen you
[59:59] to S to Salvation through sanctification
[1:00:02] of the spirit and belief of The Truth
[1:00:03] Listen there wouldn't be nothing to
[1:00:05] believe in if God hadn't sent somebody
[1:00:08] right nothing what would you
[1:00:11] believe what if that was what if you
[1:00:12] just took the name of Jesus right out of
[1:00:14] your
[1:00:15] mind or or God right out of your mind no
[1:00:20] Bible
[1:00:23] wow he may commit you to death
[1:00:27] death as he did
[1:00:30] Paul he may commit you to suffering as
[1:00:33] he did job that's his
[1:00:37] prerogative he is Sovereign
[1:00:41] yes now do we say God we understand that
[1:00:44] we know that we'll go through these
[1:00:45] fiery trials or do we do like the world
[1:00:46] and we raise our Fist and say God why'
[1:00:48] you do this to
[1:00:51] me who of us needs to question God now I
[1:00:55] question myself a lot but I don't
[1:00:58] question God when he's in it he's going
[1:00:59] to be perfect if he did not have a
[1:01:02] purpose look watch this this is his
[1:01:04] prerogative he is Sovereign but it's all
[1:01:06] with a
[1:01:07] purpose in other words what to get us in
[1:01:10] line to get us out of here huah amen if
[1:01:13] he didn't have a purpose then he would
[1:01:15] be the author of frustration and not a
[1:01:17] peace his purpose is that after we have
[1:01:21] suffered a while we would be made
[1:01:23] perfect be established strengthened and
[1:01:25] settled that the Bible that is a quote
[1:01:27] from the
[1:01:32] Bible this is where we get the quote
[1:01:34] that we always quote brother R was going
[1:01:37] through this analogy about God and
[1:01:39] suffering he says for I reckon that the
[1:01:41] suffering of this present time is not
[1:01:42] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:01:44] which shall be revealed in US suffering
[1:01:47] unless we suffer with him we cannot
[1:01:49] reign with him you have to suffer to
[1:01:52] rain you have to suffer and stand and
[1:01:54] say I'm being baptized in the name of
[1:01:56] the Lord Jesus Christ you have to suffer
[1:01:59] to say I believe that God sent a prophet
[1:02:01] you have to suffer to say hey I don't
[1:02:03] wear pants sisters I don't cut my hair
[1:02:07] you make a stand you have to suffer for
[1:02:09] that cuz listen you're not going to be
[1:02:11] put in their society you're going to be
[1:02:13] kicked out oh made oh fogy come
[1:02:19] on I want somebody you know they say
[1:02:22] that that's in the Old Testament that's
[1:02:24] okay so it's the Ten Commandments but
[1:02:26] even when I was going to school we saw
[1:02:28] some old school pictures and I I
[1:02:30] graduated in 78 so in h but in grammar
[1:02:33] school it was yeah Donnie it was in the
[1:02:36] 60s that we had teachers I didn't see
[1:02:39] them with pants on in a picture even the
[1:02:41] little girls didn't have pants on a few
[1:02:43] of them might have but you go back to
[1:02:45] Dad's era and show even the girls
[1:02:47] playing basketball had dresses
[1:02:50] on so where we come mean where yeah we
[1:02:53] evolved that that that they said oh
[1:02:55] that's okay it's diluted down now we we
[1:02:57] don't need to do that listen God loves
[1:03:01] us as we are that's right but he hates
[1:03:05] who you are that's right amen amen what
[1:03:08] we become so let's read this and then
[1:03:10] we'll take
[1:03:12] communion unless we suffer with him we
[1:03:14] cannot reign with him you have to suffer
[1:03:17] to Reign the reason for this is that
[1:03:19] character simply is never made without
[1:03:23] suffering spoiled brat we would
[1:03:27] be without a little bit of suffering
[1:03:30] character is a victory not a
[1:03:33] gift a man without character can't Reign
[1:03:38] because power apart from character is
[1:03:40] satanic yes sir but Power with character
[1:03:43] is fit to rule and since he wants us to
[1:03:46] share even his throne on the same basis
[1:03:49] that he
[1:03:51] overcome listen if he had to overcome
[1:03:54] you got to overcome on
[1:03:56] AB that he overcame and sat down his
[1:03:58] father's Throne then we have to overcome
[1:04:00] to sit with him yes and the little
[1:04:02] temporary suffering we go through now is
[1:04:05] not worthy to be compared to the
[1:04:07] tremendous Glory that will be revealed
[1:04:09] in us when he comes oh what Treasures
[1:04:12] are laid up for those who are willing to
[1:04:13] enter into his kingdom through much
[1:04:16] tribulation thinking not strange
[1:04:18] concerning the fiery trials that are to
[1:04:21] try you that's what Peter said is it
[1:04:23] strange that God wants us to develop a
[1:04:25] Christ like character that comes through
[1:04:26] suffering no sir and we all have trials
[1:04:30] we are all tried and chasen to
[1:04:34] Sons you ready for
[1:04:36] this not one but goes through
[1:04:40] it the church that is not suffering and
[1:04:43] is not being
[1:04:44] tried isn't of
[1:04:48] God L's
[1:04:51] stand the church that is not
[1:04:54] suffering and is not being tried hasn't
[1:04:57] got it it isn't of
[1:05:00] God how about
[1:05:03] that it isn't of
[1:05:07] God this special condition in Smyrna
[1:05:10] must be applied to every age there's no
[1:05:11] age free from it there's no True
[1:05:13] Believer free from it this is of god
[1:05:15] this is the will of God it is needful we
[1:05:18] need the Lord to teach us the truth that
[1:05:20] we are to suffer and be Christlike in
[1:05:22] doing it love suffereth long
[1:05:26] and is kind not
[1:05:29] better let's get ready for communion
[1:05:31] whoever's doing it come on will we'll
[1:05:33] read our communion service and uh if you
[1:05:37] have a
[1:05:38] need we have seen people
[1:05:42] healed taking
[1:05:47] communion so let's just claim that today
[1:05:50] that when you take that bread when you
[1:05:53] take that cup and you do what the Lord
[1:05:56] said then ask him to heal your body ask
[1:06:00] him to heal your your family ask him to
[1:06:02] heal your soul ask him if you need the
[1:06:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost ask him say
[1:06:07] look God I'm sick and tired of being
[1:06:09] sick and
[1:06:10] tired I don't want this no more I'm done
[1:06:13] I'm
[1:06:15] finished but remember when you say that
[1:06:18] didn't brother R say when you got born
[1:06:20] again Satan would turn every gun he had
[1:06:22] on you and he knows your weak spot and
[1:06:24] so do you yes amen I'm going to preach
[1:06:27] that one day you're a weak
[1:06:30] spot you know it I don't know your weak
[1:06:32] spot you may reveal it but I don't know
[1:06:36] it you know what your weak spot is guess
[1:06:38] what Satan does
[1:06:39] too and you better cover it with extra
[1:06:43] layers of bulletproof material called
[1:06:46] the Bible praying and reading the
[1:06:48] message of the hour and listen to the
[1:06:51] word of the Lord let's go to communion 1
[1:06:53] Corinthians 11 verse 23 says for I have
[1:06:56] received of the Lord that which also I
[1:06:57] delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus
[1:07:00] same night in which he was betrayed he
[1:07:01] took bread now he's fixing the suffer he
[1:07:05] suffered a lot already but he's fixing
[1:07:07] to suffer a most horrible death that you
[1:07:10] could ever suffer amen just so you don't
[1:07:13] have to which he was betrayed took bread
[1:07:15] and when he had given thanks he break it
[1:07:17] and said eat this is my body which is
[1:07:19] broken for you this do in remembrance of
[1:07:22] me after the same manner also he took
[1:07:24] the cup and when he had up saying this
[1:07:26] cup is the New Testament in my blood
[1:07:29] this do you as often as you drink it in
[1:07:31] remembrance of me for as often as you
[1:07:33] eat this bread and drink this cup you do
[1:07:35] show the Lord's death till he comes
[1:07:38] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:07:41] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:07:42] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:07:44] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:07:46] examine himself we're going to stop
[1:07:48] we're going to pray for a few minutes
[1:07:50] silent prayer like I said you know your
[1:07:52] needs I don't I know my needs you needs
[1:07:54] you don't
[1:07:56] but let a man examine himself check
[1:08:00] up and so let him eat of that bread and
[1:08:03] drink of that cup for he that eateth and
[1:08:05] drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh
[1:08:07] Damnation to himself not Discerning the
[1:08:09] Lord's body which is the bride of Christ
[1:08:12] for this caused many are weak and sickly
[1:08:14] among you and many
[1:08:16] sleep for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:08:19] should not be judged but we are judged
[1:08:21] we are chastened there we go chastened
[1:08:24] of the Lord that we should not be
[1:08:26] condemned with the world Listen our
[1:08:28] chastening is not what the world's going
[1:08:30] to get oh my word look at yeah praise
[1:08:34] the Lord look at what they're going to
[1:08:36] get total
[1:08:39] Annihilation that's right their skin is
[1:08:41] going to fall off their body while
[1:08:43] they're still
[1:08:44] alive birds are going to pick well I can
[1:08:47] make it worse but you read your
[1:08:50] Bible I'll take this a little bit sir
[1:08:53] I'll take this a little bit of suffering
[1:08:56] to get a to gain a greater
[1:08:59] glory not condemn with the world
[1:09:02] wherefore my brethren when you come
[1:09:03] together to eat Terry one for another
[1:09:05] and if any man hunger let him eat at
[1:09:07] home that you come not together into
[1:09:09] condemnation and the rest will I set an
[1:09:10] order Paul was going to set some other
[1:09:12] things in order when he came back so
[1:09:15] this doe in remembrance of me let's the
[1:09:17] Bible said he took
[1:09:19] bread dear heavenly father Lord I pray
[1:09:21] this bread Lord has been made with holy
[1:09:23] hands that you would Lord sanctify it
[1:09:25] Lord Lord and just bless it and be with
[1:09:26] us Lord may we remember your body that
[1:09:28] was broken for us Lord we do this Lord
[1:09:30] in remembrance of you in Jesus name amen
[1:09:34] now before we do let's have a moment of
[1:09:35] Silent prayer just for a few
[1:09:38] moments get everything
[1:09:48] clear help us each one Lord
[1:09:54] amen
[1:09:59] you know really is as Christians we have
[1:10:02] a lot of symbols that
[1:10:04] we I guess you say go
[1:10:06] by um communion foot washing what we're
[1:10:09] going to do today water
[1:10:12] baptism but the
[1:10:14] world they even do that
[1:10:17] different what do you mean you make your
[1:10:18] own
[1:10:20] bread we buy from probably Amazon
[1:10:24] now put it up and freeze it and keep it
[1:10:26] over that sounds like a good Pentecostal
[1:10:29] Revelation you we'll hold it over till
[1:10:30] the next day but this right here is
[1:10:32] going to be burnt to a crisp and where
[1:10:34] it will not be edible because new Mana
[1:10:37] fell every
[1:10:38] day new mana and whatever was left over
[1:10:42] this or they remember they tried to
[1:10:43] collect a little
[1:10:45] extra it turned into what Wiggle Worms
[1:10:48] in it it was rotten already in that in
[1:10:51] the night it had
[1:10:53] rotted but not this
[1:10:56] and the wine it gets better with
[1:11:03] age dear heavenly father B bless this
[1:11:06] wine Lord as we partake Lord may we
[1:11:08] remember you Lord that that you shed
[1:11:11] your blood for us at Calvary Lord and
[1:11:12] now that blood even now is a bumper
[1:11:15] across the Earth that protects us Lord
[1:11:18] and I pray that Lord if if nobody knows
[1:11:20] the
[1:11:21] sanctifying um word of the Lord for the
[1:11:23] blood of Jesus Christ in the end Lord
[1:11:25] may they know it today may they repent
[1:11:27] Lord and be baptized as we're going to
[1:11:29] the water in a few hours Lord in the
[1:11:31] name of Jesus Christ father I pray that
[1:11:34] you'd bless this wine and the partakers
[1:11:36] in Jesus name
[1:11:38] amen good
[1:11:40] morning I walk by the
[1:11:45] [Music]
[1:11:48] river the Ever Green
[1:11:54] Tree I'll
[1:11:56] carry my cross through the
[1:12:02] midnight come
[1:12:04] morning there's
[1:12:06] glory for
[1:12:09] me sometimes I'm despised see there
[1:12:16] chastised and I
[1:12:19] question in other words father how long
[1:12:21] have I got to put up with
[1:12:23] this you know what till we get perfected
[1:12:26] we're going to put up with it cuz we're
[1:12:28] Christians we're not bastards we're Sons
[1:12:30] and Daughters of
[1:12:32] God and I know naturally we hated our
[1:12:35] correction from our
[1:12:37] parents but don't you look back though
[1:12:40] now don't you look back now and go they
[1:12:43] should have beat me more than they
[1:12:47] did so be careful throw that hand up
[1:12:50] there I mean we all know that same way
[1:12:54] with God when he gives us a
[1:12:56] little get in line thing you ought to
[1:13:00] praise God for it he don't do that to
[1:13:02] them out there cuz they're not his
[1:13:05] children come the right
[1:13:07] way be the right way read the right word
[1:13:12] do the things of
[1:13:14] God to say Daddy whatever you got for
[1:13:18] me and listen when you was a
[1:13:21] kid this might this may be
[1:13:28] we deserved every weapon we
[1:13:33] got right so then you've done something
[1:13:36] to get that
[1:13:37] weapon right same way with God now if
[1:13:41] you don't do anything I mean you know
[1:13:43] there like I said I was trying to stop
[1:13:45] because there circumstances of parents
[1:13:46] beating their kids I don't believe in
[1:13:48] that one bit not one bit but if but if
[1:13:52] if they break the rule
[1:13:55] they do the crime they're going to do
[1:13:56] the time same way God is with us if
[1:14:00] we'll stay in line he's not going to
[1:14:02] beat us for staying in
[1:14:03] line he just beats us when we get out of
[1:14:07] line and remember it's the tender hand
[1:14:09] of Jehovah he's got nail scars in that
[1:14:11] hand he hits you with those nail scarred
[1:14:14] hands just to push you back in the way
[1:14:17] just like the chief
[1:14:18] shepherd He had to break one of them his
[1:14:20] leg to bring it
[1:14:24] back
[1:14:28] if you ever looked at a sheep I saw one
[1:14:30] the other day Brother Richard Wilson
[1:14:32] preached a sermon a long time ago where
[1:14:34] brother Bram says he I think it's either
[1:14:36] in his life story or somewhere where
[1:14:38] brother Bram said Lord you sheared me
[1:14:40] one time Shear me again well you look at
[1:14:42] that word Shear see a lamb produces wool
[1:14:45] right well they showed a lamb that had
[1:14:49] not been sheared in like 5 years the
[1:14:52] wool was like 100 lb the L lamb was
[1:14:56] sick am I getting somewhere with this
[1:14:59] the lamb was
[1:15:01] sick and the wool was worthless because
[1:15:03] it had come to a place of hardness to
[1:15:05] where it was no good at all because
[1:15:07] somebody left him alone for 5 years and
[1:15:10] didn't Shear him well Lord Shear
[1:15:13] Me Shear us all to keep that excess
[1:15:17] away God will be able to use you if he
[1:15:20] shears you he won't be able to use you
[1:15:23] if he don't Shear you so let's partake
[1:15:25] communion God bless
[1:15:36] you thank you
[1:15:38] Lord let's read our foot washing

[1:16:01] 13:2 supper being ended the devil having
[1:16:04] now put in the heart of Judas his carot
[1:16:05] Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing
[1:16:08] that the father had given all things
[1:16:09] into his hands and he was come from God
[1:16:11] and went to God he rises from supper and
[1:16:13] laid aside his garments and took a towel
[1:16:15] and girded himself after that he poured
[1:16:17] water into a basin and began to wash the
[1:16:19] disciples feet and to wipe them with the
[1:16:21] towel where with he was girded then
[1:16:24] cometh he to s Peter and Peter said unto

[1:16:30] thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know
[1:16:33] Hereafter Peter sure to listen to him
[1:16:35] but Peter said unto him Thou shalt never

[1:16:52] not saved to wash his feet but is clean
