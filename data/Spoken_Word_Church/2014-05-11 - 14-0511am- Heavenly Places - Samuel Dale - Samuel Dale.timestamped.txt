[4:50] thank you
[5:01] yes you're holy holy holy I want to see
[5:08] you
[5:10] amen and amen and amen I want to honest
[5:13] don't you good to see everybody in the
[5:15] house of the Lord
[5:16] if you'd like to turn in your scriptures
[5:18] turn to Ephesians 1
[5:21] and Ephesians 2 will try to continue on
[5:25] where we were this past Wednesday
[5:27] and I would invite all of you
[5:31] the ones especially who did not hear the
[5:34] message Wednesday I would ask that you
[5:36] would listen to it I think it would be
[5:38] very helpful and very valuable to
[5:42] understand uh where we're at and what
[5:45] we're doing and I just ask you to if you
[5:48] would to listen to it that way we'll try
[5:50] to review a higher this morning but we
[5:52] won't put too much in now we know for
[5:56] Surety today is Mother's Day
[5:59] and we always honor all of the mothers
[6:02] and potential mothers
[6:05] and that's why that we have a point of
[6:08] saying uh you know that we were going to
[6:11] give a little gift today to all of the
[6:13] marriage sisters
[6:16] and the mothers now the reason we're
[6:18] saying it that way because a married
[6:20] sister no matter where you are if you're
[6:22] 90 years old you're a potential mother
[6:24] uh Abraham and Sarah okay all right
[6:28] so we're not saying well this one can't
[6:31] and that one can't because it don't but
[6:33] you know I still believe in God can do
[6:35] miracles
[6:36] all right so we have a little gift for
[6:39] you we always take all of the brothers
[6:41] or or we don't pay all expenses but we
[6:44] you know we kind of handle expenses to
[6:46] allow the brothers to go on a Father's
[6:49] Day and we don't lay that down as
[6:51] fathers only you know we we say to all
[6:54] of the men of the church that they're
[6:55] welcome to come and be with us and we
[6:58] have a good time fishing together and
[7:00] fellowshipping together for two or three
[7:02] days there so you know we want to do
[7:04] this for the for the uh Sisters of the
[7:07] church all right and we thank each one
[7:09] of you let's give our all of the mothers
[7:11] a good hand all right and the potential
[7:14] mothers
[7:15] because they are
[7:19] wonderful things as the old Feller said
[7:22] if there wasn't no Mudders it wouldn't
[7:23] be no fodders
[7:24] so that's That's the basis of it I've
[7:28] I've always taught you and believed it
[7:30] Abraham was I mean Adam was capable of a
[7:33] lot of things but you know that Adam
[7:35] couldn't bring four children without Eve
[7:37] and I honestly believed that he would
[7:39] not have brought him forth in a spoken
[7:42] creation
[7:44] I'm honest because if it was in our you
[7:47] know and I don't mean that wrong it
[7:49] could have been anything I mean he I
[7:51] believe he would have spoke him into
[7:52] existence but he's going to speak them
[7:53] through Eve I believe that I believe
[7:55] that Eve would have been the mother but
[7:58] it wound up being the wrong mother right
[7:59] but we appreciate all of the true
[8:02] mothers all right here on Mother's Day
[8:04] we have a little thank you note from
[8:06] from Brother Hank and sister Martha
[8:08] black
[8:10] they say thanks everyone
[8:13] of this church
[8:15] for caring for me and my wife and thank
[8:17] you very much we love you amen so we
[8:19] appreciate that all right we're going to
[8:23] try to take up as I said where we left
[8:25] off Wednesday so we'll read Ephesians
[8:29] all right remember now this coming
[8:30] weekend is the fellowship meeting

[8:45] good time in the Lord Brother Douglas is
[8:47] going to be with us preaching brother
[8:50] Ernie could not brother villain Nueva
[8:51] could not come and be with us because of
[8:53] his problems with his feet so we
[8:55] remember him and keep him in your
[8:57] prayers that the Lord would bless him
[8:59] all right so remember that Ephesians 1
[9:01] and Ephesians 2.
[9:03] Lord Jesus we thank you for all things
[9:06] and we Praise Your Great Name we just
[9:09] ask you Lord that you would just be with
[9:10] each and every one of us and bless in

[9:16] through each one of us we love you and
[9:18] we thank you and we commit everything
[9:19] into your hands believing that you will
[9:23] honor your word because you put it there
[9:26] for us and we read it and we lord all we
[9:29] have to do is remind you of what you say
[9:31] it and Lord what a wonderful thing it is
[9:34] to have a father that would care for
[9:36] each and every one of us we love you and
[9:38] we commit everything into your hands now
[9:40] in Jesus name
[9:41] amen
[9:45] we'll read from Ephesians
[9:48] 1.
[9:55] 15.
[10:00] run
[10:03] so much off in the back
[10:05] Ephesians 1 and Ephesians 2.
[10:08] we'll get up in a minute but we'll read
[10:10] the scripture there we go
[10:14] now listen to what the Apostle Paul has
[10:16] to say wherefore I also after I heard of
[10:19] your faith in the Lord Jesus and love
[10:21] unto all the saints cease not to give
[10:24] thanks for you making mention of you in
[10:27] my prayers
[10:28] that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ
[10:30] the father of Glory may give unto you
[10:32] the spirit of wisdom and revelation
[10:35] in the knowledge of him
[10:37] the eyes of your understanding being
[10:39] enlightened that you may know what is
[10:42] the hope of his calling and what the
[10:44] riches of the glory of his inheritance
[10:46] in the Saints
[10:47] and what is the exceeding greatness of
[10:49] his power to usward who believe
[10:52] according to the working of his mighty
[10:54] power
[10:55] which he wrought in Christ when he
[10:57] raised him from the dead and set him
[11:01] at his own right hand or in Heavenly
[11:05] places far above all principalities and
[11:08] powers and might and Dominion in every
[11:10] name his name not only in the world but
[11:12] also in that which is to come Ephesians
[11:15] 2. now remember that's him
[11:18] he was raised up to Heavenly places
[11:21] all right now then watch what he does to
[11:24] us on Ephesians 2 and verse 5.
[11:28] even when we were dead in sins
[11:32] have quickened us together with Christ
[11:34] by Grace you're saved
[11:37] and hath raised us up together and made
[11:39] us sit together in Heavenly places in
[11:43] Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he
[11:46] might show the exceeding Riches of his
[11:48] grace in his kindness toward us through
[11:51] Christ Jesus you may be seated the Lord
[11:54] had his Blessing to the reading of the
[11:57] word
[12:01] now I want to try to just pick up
[12:03] because
[12:03] I kind of got the Lord kind of changed
[12:06] things
[12:07] that are Wednesday and I kind of went
[12:10] into a little different way
[12:13] to express
[12:15] you know what was on my heart and I pray
[12:17] that you enjoyed that and as I said I
[12:20] would like for you if you would to go
[12:22] back and view that
[12:25] for a moment you know sometimes when you
[12:27] get a chance because I was trying to
[12:29] explain
[12:30] to me you know I I gave the illustration
[12:35] like
[12:36] Paul we'll read it in a little bit said
[12:38] the Lord himself shall descend from
[12:40] heaven with a shout
[12:42] Morse of an archangel and a trumpet all
[12:45] right that's been a mystery
[12:47] that man has made it this way and he's
[12:50] made it that way and he's made it this
[12:51] way and he's made a holler out of it or
[12:53] made a great big Angel descending out
[12:55] and it's happening or a great big to do
[12:57] to do trumpet and uh
[13:00] all of those things
[13:02] and trying to figure out what is meant
[13:04] but I asked a question and made the
[13:07] thought see if you come over to where
[13:09] brother Brandon was at
[13:11] and brother Brandon would say you know
[13:13] what Paul said the Lord himself shall
[13:15] descend from heaven with a shout
[13:17] before someone Archangel trumpet
[13:19] and you said Paul what do you mean he
[13:22] said I meant the Lord and would descend
[13:24] from heaven with a shout
[13:25] right
[13:27] because that's what Paul was saying all
[13:30] right well what was he really saying it
[13:31] bringing it down to the prophet he said
[13:34] that Jesus does all three of these
[13:37] things in his descending
[13:40] we'll get more on that this afternoon
[13:42] maybe but see the point was that
[13:46] Paul saw it you remember Wednesday I was
[13:49] trying to explain when a prophet says
[13:51] something when Paul saw that he said
[13:54] in other words he was looking at it and
[13:57] to him he could see it my spiritual
[13:59] Revelation and he'll said with Jesus the
[14:03] Lord you know whatever Jesus Will
[14:05] descend from heaven
[14:06] with a shout divorce of an archangels or
[14:08] trumpet
[14:10] that's what Paul was saying brother
[14:12] random put it in human terminologies for
[14:14] us
[14:15] to just say that Jesus done all three of
[14:18] those things
[14:20] in his descending
[14:22] all right
[14:24] now we'll get back as I said I want to
[14:27] try to bring this thought in
[14:29] but we'll get back more this afternoon
[14:31] on the point of thinking about that
[14:33] remember
[14:35] if Jesus does all three and he's
[14:37] descending
[14:39] well that's coming here
[14:42] we've always looked at Rapture is going
[14:44] there
[14:47] right
[14:48] see we look at going up that way the
[14:51] Bible looks at coming this way so that's
[14:53] the mass confusion
[14:55] right in other words we're we're the
[14:58] ones that are wrong
[14:59] why couldn't we read when it says you
[15:03] know in other words why didn't we read
[15:05] the Bible because I know we wouldn't
[15:06] prophets we're not prophets that's the
[15:08] reason we didn't read it that way but
[15:10] brother Brandon when he read it he says
[15:13] Jesus does all three of these
[15:16] in his descending
[15:18] you know what that's simple to him
[15:21] but you know what when Paul said it
[15:24] he saw it
[15:27] like I said about Naaman seeing charius
[15:29] Johnson in the streets he saw Cadillacs
[15:31] and Buicks and things running into each
[15:33] other on the highways and with lightning
[15:35] with headlights on we didn't know how to
[15:37] describe that
[15:38] so when he spoke it it automatically
[15:40] became sealed
[15:44] to the unbeliever
[15:46] right
[15:48] but you know what and Iman saw it
[15:50] I believe Paul saw the Lord Jesus Christ
[15:53] descending from heaven with a shout and
[15:55] abortion were knocking on trumpet
[16:00] but you know what
[16:02] once he spoke it
[16:07] he was the only one there that knew what
[16:09] that was
[16:11] right
[16:12] right and once he spoke it
[16:15] it automatically became a prophecy
[16:19] a prophecy is speaking of a future event
[16:22] or things are doing what do you follow
[16:25] what I mean see then when brother
[16:27] Branham came along
[16:29] and him being the prophet God could tell
[16:31] him what that was so he said Jesus does
[16:34] all three of these in his descending
[16:36] you know what he saw it
[16:39] I believe the prophet of this end time
[16:41] saw the end of all the Rapture etc etc I
[16:45] believe he saw that all right
[16:48] but you know as quick as he said it
[16:51] it became a human
[16:53] uh knowledge
[16:55] to you and I
[16:57] that Paul was actually saying that it
[17:00] would not be until the end time
[17:02] then it would be that Jesus would
[17:04] descend from heaven with a shout the
[17:06] voice of Archangel trumpet all right
[17:10] you know what it became as quick as the
[17:11] prophet spoke it a prophecy
[17:16] because nobody didn't know what he was
[17:18] saying right oh but I read that I was
[17:22] sitting there when he said that
[17:27] okay I'm not going to argue with you
[17:32] I'm just gonna leave it in your lap
[17:35] but I'm going to give you an
[17:36] illustration then I'll get onto the
[17:37] message
[17:39] have you ever read the message the Bible
[17:42] and think
[17:43] and you see something so clear
[17:46] right
[17:48] it is so clear to you
[17:50] I mean you want everybody to see it
[17:54] right
[17:55] and you run over to somebody
[17:58] yeah
[18:00] and you start to tell them and
[18:03] oh
[18:08] you know what because once you speak it
[18:10] it's a prophecy
[18:15] when you've seen it it was reality
[18:19] right
[18:21] you remember the little boy that that
[18:23] said that time were about you know that
[18:25] you sitting there and he's telling
[18:26] someone he said well then I I know
[18:28] something nobody knows it but Daddy and
[18:31] me
[18:33] he said me and Daddy's all the one that
[18:34] knows this
[18:36] a little bit
[18:39] actually what's the matter he said now
[18:41] Daddy's the only one that knows it
[18:44] because he'd forgot
[18:46] all right see once brother random spoke
[18:48] this message
[18:50] if you understand what I'm getting at
[18:52] yes
[18:53] it automatically is sealed up
[18:58] no brother damn it was unveiled in our
[19:00] day
[19:01] oh how carnal
[19:05] we read the Bible when it said the Lord
[19:08] confess to understand from heaven with a
[19:10] shout and we had to to do to do and the
[19:12] horns blowing and the sound into this
[19:14] and to do another that and some great
[19:16] big something happened in the sky and an
[19:18] archangel come down and
[19:21] we don't want to talk about them days do
[19:23] we
[19:26] right
[19:28] we don't want to talk about them days
[19:29] now do we
[19:33] see once this message is revealed it's
[19:36] no longer a prophecy I've tried to
[19:39] preach that for 40 something years
[19:41] when this message is revealed it's no
[19:43] longer prophecy
[19:45] but it's only revealed to an individual
[19:48] it's not revealed to a group of people
[19:50] we're not Jews we're not dealing with
[19:52] that but even to the Jews when they come
[19:54] in it'll still come as individuals that
[19:57] will make up to 144 000.
[20:02] you see
[20:04] the prophet said it
[20:06] that's a revelation
[20:08] the Bible said it
[20:12] the Bible never said baptized father son
[20:14] Holy Ghost
[20:18] that's how carnal you are
[20:21] Matthew 28 19 says Lord Jesus Christ
[20:28] right
[20:32] so I know we go
[20:36] oh forget my theatrical expressions
[20:40] and get the point
[20:42] we had the Bible
[20:48] but it was only a prophecy
[20:51] that's right once this Prophet began to
[20:52] expound upon it the only thing we have
[20:55] right now I don't care how long you've
[20:57] been in the message I don't care if your
[20:59] family
[21:02] you know what I mean by that the kids
[21:04] are the prophet the wife of the Prophet
[21:06] the thing the daughters it's got to be
[21:09] revealed amen
[21:11] if it ain't revealed it's only words
[21:16] right but once it's revealed
[21:18] that a random said you want him
[21:22] as long as it's laying on the pages of
[21:24] this book
[21:26] it can be questioned he said
[21:30] but said once it's revealed
[21:33] it can't be questioned you mean somebody
[21:36] could talk you out of water baptism
[21:39] now you got baptized in the name of the
[21:40] Lord Jesus Christ you know when you
[21:41] followed 40 years and then somebody talk
[21:43] you out and show you it was really
[21:45] supposed to be father son Holy Ghost
[21:47] yeah and our Revelation to start with
[21:51] come on
[21:53] they can't deprogram somebody in the
[21:55] message
[21:57] that's what tickles me they'll take
[21:59] people in the message and deprogram them
[22:00] with a trinity now boy that's something
[22:02] man
[22:04] um I'll get off of that okay
[22:06] but just remember
[22:10] I think you agree with one point I just
[22:12] made
[22:13] you try to explain something to somebody
[22:15] that is so beautifully marvelously
[22:18] revealed to you
[22:21] and then when you start to try to
[22:23] explain that
[22:25] it's just like it's gone
[22:28] why your words is making it a prophecy
[22:35] according to page 45 I believe it is
[22:36] Christ the mystery God revealed right
[22:38] around and said the Holy Ghost is the
[22:40] only revealer of the word
[22:42] couldn't reveal the word he could only
[22:45] speak upon the things until the Holy
[22:47] Ghost could speak back to you and I and
[22:49] that's the only thing anybody can do
[22:51] all right are you following me amen see
[22:55] once you speak it
[22:57] once the prophet spoke it
[23:00] it was sealed up
[23:04] you know you want a scripture for that
[23:06] according to
[23:07] over the Book of Daniel that said seal
[23:09] up the things that have been spoken you
[23:10] know they had been spoken
[23:12] you know that brother random said Daniel
[23:15] heard the Thunder
[23:17] come on
[23:19] come on
[23:21] he said Daniel heard the Thunders but he
[23:23] was told to seal it up
[23:27] right how did he seal it up by writing
[23:29] it
[23:31] come on
[23:33] be sensible
[23:36] once he pinned it he could not put it to
[23:39] her what was in his mind
[23:41] then it takes the same one it wrote it
[23:43] to be in there to interpret it
[23:47] to you and I
[23:49] all right
[23:50] that's what I was trying to get out
[23:51] Wednesday night
[23:53] but listen
[23:56] think about it now
[23:57] we read from Paul and we tried to cover
[23:59] a little our Wednesday and then we'll
[24:00] take up right here
[24:04] and Paul said to the Ephesians that
[24:08] Jesus Christ
[24:11] was raised up
[24:14] to the right hand of the father right
[24:18] and that he was
[24:22] sitting right
[24:25] says to you and I the
[24:28] next chapter second chapter
[24:31] that by the new birth now not just
[24:34] because we hear it and
[24:36] but by the new birth
[24:40] when you're born again that raises you
[24:43] out of natural carnality into the
[24:47] spiritual revelation
[24:49] and when you're born again you are
[24:52] sitting in Heavenly places
[24:58] and what did the prophet say the
[24:59] Heavenly places was Christ of Mr God
[25:01] revealed he said the believer's position
[25:03] in Christ
[25:05] you know you've got a position
[25:08] the day you was born again you got a
[25:10] position
[25:14] well I don't know my position what
[25:17] what are you supposed to be
[25:22] I mean you women know you're not
[25:24] supposed to preach so it takes that
[25:25] position out
[25:27] which you do know you can testify that
[25:30] puts that position in
[25:32] you do know you have a family to preach
[25:34] to your kids
[25:37] right
[25:39] but you know what silliness we are
[25:44] see we're so silly and so uh great
[25:48] Revelations that we have
[25:51] until we'll say now no woman ain't
[25:53] supposed to teach a boy
[25:55] when the boy gets to be about 12 30 and
[25:57] they don't here we don't allow that we
[25:59] believe that
[26:01] a woman's not supposed to teach
[26:04] the kids you know
[26:06] but you're going to say that she's not
[26:08] supposed to teach her family
[26:10] now you've gone into dumb stupidity
[26:15] just because that kid is 30 years old
[26:17] you mean mama can't tell him something
[26:21] but don't put her over the teaching the
[26:24] class
[26:25] we know the order
[26:27] well everyone says you sisters has got
[26:29] your pulpit
[26:31] it's your family
[26:34] and you know that's what gets to a
[26:36] problem with the people of the message
[26:37] then
[26:39] the man's wife will try to tell the
[26:41] husband something
[26:43] in the head of this house
[26:45] you can't tell me nothing well that's
[26:47] true you can't tell them
[26:51] nobody can
[26:54] it's kind of odd
[26:58] one time in a situation with sister
[27:00] meedy that she would wind up with a
[27:02] growth because of saying something
[27:04] but in other situations
[27:09] when she would correct him
[27:11] like he was saying ain't nothing but
[27:12] three great men you know one year now
[27:14] that one out of Kentucky
[27:16] and she says bill that's not right
[27:19] well you know what she didn't get a
[27:20] growth out of that one
[27:23] you see what I mean
[27:25] we got it all figured out boy we got oh
[27:27] man we yeah
[27:30] I got the quote
[27:33] what is the believer's position but
[27:35] around
[27:36] it's his position in Christ
[27:40] all right amen now we get in that
[27:44] position
[27:45] and we're in Heavenly places
[27:48] and you know what
[27:50] the day you got born again that Soul
[27:52] entered into an eternal state right
[27:55] by the new birth
[27:57] now does it come back out and you ain't
[27:59] in Heavenly places
[28:04] no no no no no no no there's something
[28:06] wrong with your thinking
[28:08] I didn't know eternal life come in and
[28:10] out
[28:12] but I do admit that a lot of times
[28:13] physically we're not in spiritual we're
[28:16] not in the Heavenly places don't you
[28:20] huh people who say the Lord told me to
[28:22] say that
[28:25] it might be true
[28:27] and if it is true you're all right but
[28:28] if it ain't true you're wrong
[28:30] all right
[28:32] but think about it the believer's
[28:33] position
[28:37] now
[28:39] this was the point I wanted to get
[28:40] across because we about page 15 of the
[28:43] church age book let's see if we can find
[28:45] it go ahead I believe it's number four
[28:47] let me just read this I believe it's
[28:49] right now going down to
[28:56] go to number nine I've got so many notes
[28:59] on the point
[29:00] you know but on here you him brother
[29:02] Brown was talking about
[29:04] one thing that I want to get to in a
[29:05] minute for certain
[29:08] he says
[29:09] we're living away below our privileges
[29:17] living below our privileges
[29:21] running that on your computer sometimes
[29:23] to see how many times he said that that
[29:25] we live below our privileges
[29:27] but you know what he says we do
[29:31] he said we were losing our inheritance
[29:34] excuse me brother and I'm sorry pull
[29:36] back up number four
[29:38] let's just read it
[29:39] I try to get ahead and everything and I
[29:41] lose and then
[29:42] so they'll get it I mean pull number
[29:44] four up which you hear you him
[29:46] E43
[29:48] hell no that's uh
[29:51] number six come on I'm looking down at
[29:54] my notes and I've got them number six
[29:56] well go get it don't worry about it
[29:57] don't nobody leave I'll get my mind back
[29:59] together right a while
[30:01] okay
[30:03] well look what he did and I think that's
[30:05] just where our churches are getting
[30:07] we're children of God
[30:10] but we're losing our inheritance by our
[30:12] conduct
[30:13] the things that we do and the things
[30:15] that we permit to be done and the way
[30:17] that we live and act and so forth
[30:21] all right
[30:22] now that's easy to understand that part
[30:26] that's us and that's our conducts and
[30:28] our ways and our manners of doing
[30:30] that's making us live below our
[30:32] privileges right
[30:34] but the rest of it is what I want you to
[30:35] read we're living millions of miles
[30:37] below our privilege
[30:39] now watch
[30:41] and then someone can see the work of God
[30:44] being done
[30:47] and Dr so and so Dr Jones says it's it's
[30:52] this
[30:55] and the other doctor says it's this
[30:58] and we believe it instead of looking
[31:00] into the word
[31:06] now could I paraphrase that just a
[31:08] little bit you know
[31:11] may I remember a vision that brother
[31:13] Branham had
[31:17] and he had a vision of a woman that he
[31:19] saw
[31:20] and a man standing there with a
[31:22] three-cornered stick
[31:24] and said every time that woman would
[31:26] raise up you remember
[31:28] he'd hit her with that three-quartered
[31:29] stick
[31:31] well while he got upset and he told him
[31:33] he said now you gotta do that again
[31:37] and it went away he said then the
[31:40] interpretation came that the church as
[31:44] it would try to raise up
[31:47] he said then that Trinity comes along
[31:49] and knocks him back down
[31:53] yep well you know see we think about
[31:57] well brother Dale I ain't never heard
[31:58] nobody talk about your Trinity my
[32:00] preacher Don't Preach the Trinity what
[32:01] are you talking about
[32:03] if he preaches anything contrary to
[32:05] Hebrews 13 18 he's preaching the trinity
[32:08] even if he's preaching Oneness Oneness
[32:10] just goes over the other way and it's
[32:12] still trinitarianism
[32:13] come on
[32:17] but you see what happens to you and I we
[32:18] start trying to raise up
[32:21] I've watched that for 40 something years
[32:23] I preached it for 40 something years to
[32:25] try to get you to see something and I'd
[32:26] see it start rising up and a few start
[32:29] catching on to what I was doing and what
[32:31] I was trying to preach and then all at
[32:33] once I see the devil come in and flop
[32:38] and try to take it away
[32:41] well you know they don't have to say a
[32:43] lot you say well that might be right in
[32:45] a way
[32:50] now he's either Hebrews 13 later he's
[32:52] not brother Reynolds said now that's he
[32:54] said it's not in a way he said the mule
[32:56] is the one that says is in a way
[32:59] so now you want to listen to The Mule
[33:06] we had a brother come here one time
[33:08] years ago
[33:09] that he saw the pillar of fire up here
[33:11] at the front you remember the story
[33:18] and he saw that Pillar of Fire and I
[33:20] believe he did
[33:24] but then after a while you know it was
[33:25] okay because we're seeing the pillar of
[33:27] fire everybody's kind of well a filler
[33:29] of fire we send a pillar of fire you
[33:31] know
[33:32] and then one day he saw it again
[33:36] and he said it come off the platform and
[33:38] went out in the congregation
[33:40] so this one brother he had the great
[33:42] idea
[33:43] he said we need to
[33:45] put the purify to come back into the
[33:48] building called us leaving out I get up
[33:50] here right here and told him I said I
[33:52] don't agree with him
[33:54] you remember it's on tape
[33:57] I said because
[33:58] the pillar of fire up here to me is one
[34:00] thing but that ain't gonna do you no
[34:02] good
[34:04] I said I believe the purifier left here
[34:06] because I wanted to leave here you know
[34:09] what I mean I don't want to go away from
[34:10] me I wanted to go out back where you're
[34:12] at
[34:14] of course
[34:15] did they change the brother's thoughts
[34:17] no no
[34:19] you still talk to Bill if I went out the
[34:21] door
[34:22] well some of you you know sympathize
[34:24] with that
[34:26] and you thought it went out the door
[34:29] do you understand what I'm getting at
[34:31] you understand what the prophet's saying
[34:33] Dr Jones Dr so-and-so doctor or this
[34:36] that or the other since
[34:38] well maybe in a way
[34:42] the biggest hindrance we have
[34:45] is the preachers in this message
[34:48] I've said that 40 something years ago
[34:50] and I don't back off today
[34:52] who's the ones that stirring up all the
[34:54] stuff
[34:57] what is that catch the
[35:01] believe the sign go home run any
[35:03] computer find out how many is turned
[35:04] against the message now preachers
[35:09] they said there's one resigned today
[35:10] there was one just the other day you
[35:11] know he he wanted to vacation and his
[35:14] church told him just to go ahead and
[35:15] leave I didn't tell you the name of that
[35:17] they can tell it to you now
[35:19] later on
[35:21] ain't none of our business
[35:23] it's just a point of what I'm trying to
[35:25] get
[35:29] if you say brother random was wrong
[35:32] like a brother said he said I ain't
[35:34] having one of them one of them pictures
[35:36] of the cloud that's going down the
[35:39] stairs used to be up here but that he
[35:40] said having one of them in my church
[35:45] well
[35:48] I would get my church my seal book and
[35:53] and I would go burn it
[35:55] if that's the way I believed
[35:57] but yet he preached the seals
[35:59] well I thought that was were that the
[36:02] angel of the Lord met the prophet to
[36:04] tell him about to come back to
[36:05] Jeffersonville and the seals would be
[36:06] broke you see what we do a congregation
[36:09] amen
[36:11] poor people
[36:15] yeah okay come on
[36:17] but when it happens somebody just comes
[36:20] along and plants a little seed
[36:25] well you know brother Dale I believe
[36:27] what he was talking about he said when
[36:28] he said so and so
[36:33] that's all you've done
[36:35] I've Illustrated it right
[36:38] and I can go say
[36:40] you know
[36:42] brother Carly minus Wade
[36:46] seems like he don't oh forget it forget
[36:48] it I went and I brought it up or not I
[36:50] brought it up
[36:52] now in the court of law that's what you
[36:54] call uh things to get attention it's not
[36:58] allowed
[37:00] right
[37:01] and the judge will tell you in a hurry
[37:03] jury smike that from your thinking
[37:07] it's done been said
[37:12] now welcome well what's it called
[37:14] against me
[37:17] you see how easy it is to be deceived
[37:25] but he said we're living below our
[37:27] privileges
[37:28] why
[37:30] because we're allowing people to shift
[37:32] from us
[37:34] the truth of the message or the hour
[37:37] and yet they're claim to believe it
[37:42] right
[37:45] believe in the Lord privileges
[37:50] now we'll go to number nine
[37:53] okay
[37:54] which is a revelation of Jesus Christ
[37:55] Church age book page 15. very familiar
[37:58] with all of us
[38:01] and remember now watch
[38:05] Christ into church is a continuation in
[38:06] the book of Acts
[38:09] I don't see the book right
[38:13] words at church just got it where Silver
[38:16] and Gold Have I None but in the name of
[38:19] Jesus Christ rise up and walk
[38:22] huh I've heard preachers say that
[38:25] preachers That was supposed to be
[38:27] preaching faith
[38:31] now his brother ran right or wrong
[38:34] I'm going to say what he says you're
[38:36] just going to do what you want to
[38:38] he says this is a continuation of the
[38:40] book of Acts
[38:43] so the book of Acts never left
[38:47] the Holy Ghost was in every Church age
[38:50] right
[38:53] with the Book of Revelation shows how
[38:55] the Antichrist Spirit would come into
[38:57] the church and defile it watch making it
[39:00] lukewarm formal and Powerless now how
[39:03] does he do that
[39:11] The Book of Revelation exposes Satan
[39:14] revealing his Works what is it attempted
[39:17] destruction of God's people and the
[39:20] discrediting
[39:21] of God's word
[39:24] right down to the time he's cast into
[39:26] the Lake of Fire he fights that he
[39:28] cannot stand it he knows now listen to
[39:31] him
[39:32] that if the people get the true
[39:34] revelation
[39:36] of the true church
[39:38] and what she is what she stands for
[39:41] and that she can do the Greater Works
[39:45] come on
[39:48] and watch
[39:51] what will it be
[39:54] by God's spirit come on let's go back
[39:56] she will be an invincible Army if they
[39:59] get a true revelation of the two spirits
[40:03] now what two Spirits are you talking
[40:05] about
[40:06] within the framework of the Christian
[40:08] church
[40:09] I only know two spirits
[40:13] one is God the others the devil
[40:15] now if you've got anything in between
[40:16] it's got to be in one of those
[40:17] categories
[40:19] all right
[40:21] so God wants us to believe it Satan
[40:24] wants us to doubt it
[40:27] right the two spirits were within the
[40:31] framework of the Christian church
[40:34] can I can I read it this way
[40:37] spirits
[40:38] in Lula Georgia
[40:42] see I don't mind talking
[40:45] but I'm trying to say sold I ain't
[40:47] trying to build buildings
[40:52] and by God's spirit discern and
[40:55] withstand the Antichrist spirit
[40:58] how do you withstand a spirit
[41:02] boy you got a bad spirit I detect that
[41:05] bad Spirit that's a bad spiritual guy
[41:07] amen
[41:10] well I got discernment
[41:15] how do you discern a spirit
[41:22] the only way I know is by the word
[41:25] whether it agrees with the word or
[41:27] difference with the word
[41:28] of course you got the middle in between
[41:30] you know maybe in a way
[41:33] I'm you
[41:36] look Satan will be powerless before her
[41:41] he'll be as definitely thwarted today as
[41:43] when Christ withstood is every effort to
[41:46] gain power over him in the desert yes
[41:48] Satan hates
[41:50] Revelation but we love it with a true
[41:52] Revelation in our lives the Gates of
[41:54] Hell cannot Prevail against us but we'll
[41:57] Prevail over them
[42:01] look how simple
[42:03] a prophet could make it
[42:08] that we're living before below our
[42:10] privileges
[42:13] what is living before below our
[42:16] privileges
[42:18] what is living before your privilege
[42:20] he's not knowing who you are
[42:22] right right
[42:24] when you don't know who you are you're
[42:26] living below your privilege you know
[42:28] I mean
[42:30] somebody come along
[42:31] and tell me say hey
[42:34] Mr Dale we got some records
[42:37] of course all this has to be false
[42:39] because I my daddy was poorer than I am
[42:42] would you say your daddy left you a
[42:44] hundred million dollars
[42:49] all you gotta do is collect it
[42:53] no
[42:55] and I'd say
[42:57] no way
[43:00] my daddy didn't have no money died poor
[43:06] you know what I'm doing I'm living below
[43:07] my privilege right
[43:09] good only got to do is go collect it
[43:12] but instead of doing it I'm letting some
[43:15] human interpretation
[43:18] block me away
[43:21] from
[43:23] what God is trying to say to me
[43:28] like I've always said to you we people
[43:30] will say oh if Lula had more signs and
[43:33] wonder
[43:34] how many churches can you save it's got
[43:36] six cases of the Dead raised
[43:47] I'm not throwing off on nobody
[43:49] but you know what let somebody over in
[43:51] Africa some of these big name guys hear
[43:53] of some church
[43:56] and you know what I believe it
[43:58] I believe that lady over there was
[44:00] getting that meal up and cooking it and
[44:02] it was appearing right back in the
[44:03] barrel I believe that you know why
[44:06] because I'm a Believer
[44:12] but compile meal in a barrel to dead
[44:14] raised
[44:18] come on Church
[44:22] we've seen the word spoken
[44:27] we don't have to back down
[44:29] it's on record
[44:31] but the main thing is whether or not we
[44:34] stayed with the word
[44:39] and I don't agree with your attitude in
[44:40] your ways your way of saying things
[44:42] you're just so sure
[44:47] it's fine with me I got to deal with
[44:49] those things myself
[44:52] you show me where you can turn down the
[44:53] word just because it I look at you and
[44:55] say you're ugly
[45:01] right
[45:04] give an illustration you know said the
[45:06] other day brother Colin say he's ugly
[45:11] and then he looked back at me and said
[45:13] you're ugly and I am well I'd agree with
[45:14] him
[45:17] we see people think well that's
[45:19] but what about the word
[45:23] what does the word say
[45:25] well I don't know whether that's the
[45:27] word or not
[45:29] you've been in this message
[45:31] how long
[45:34] and you don't know what the word says
[45:40] well you've been reading a lot of
[45:42] Greer's Almanac
[45:46] maybe a few Playboy magazines in between
[45:51] now you're getting okay
[45:54] listen
[45:56] discrediting of God's word
[46:00] that's why we're living below our
[46:03] privileges
[46:08] and we'd like to get this next one look
[46:10] at number 10.
[46:11] I probably ain't gonna get done this
[46:12] morning again
[46:15] this is what I had Wednesday night to
[46:16] bring and I
[46:18] okay look what he says in Israel and
[46:21] church
[46:22] 1953.
[46:26] I truly believe before the church can
[46:28] have the rapture
[46:31] now that what we've been talking about
[46:32] Rapture called away you know
[46:35] it's got to have Rapture and faith
[46:40] not watching
[46:42] we can't even have faith for Divine
[46:45] Healing
[46:46] let alone Rapture in faith
[46:52] but you know what
[46:55] how many people read the rest of it
[47:02] come on
[47:03] how many sermons have you ever heard of
[47:06] we live below our privileges
[47:10] how many preachers have you ever heard
[47:12] say
[47:14] we ain't got enough faith for Divine
[47:16] Healing how can we be raptured
[47:20] and that's all they say
[47:24] right
[47:26] right come on you didn't listen come on
[47:29] Doc I said the other day you picked me
[47:30] to death about the things I say why
[47:33] don't you pick these others you listen
[47:35] to
[47:37] you know what I'm saying the truth the
[47:40] preachers are saying it
[47:42] we ain't got enough faith for Divine
[47:44] Healing
[47:46] sermon I had a sermon
[47:48] how are we gonna have fight for a
[47:49] rapture
[47:51] you never hear how to have faith
[47:54] you only hear what you ain't got
[47:59] right right
[48:03] I know it I'm sarcastic an old dude
[48:05] that's it forget it
[48:07] but what is the truth
[48:11] look what he says
[48:13] sure we can't even have faith for Divine
[48:16] Healing that's wonderful I believe it
[48:19] but we've seen healing
[48:22] now what do you want to talk about
[48:25] we've seen the dead Rays now what do you
[48:27] want to talk about
[48:30] well because it don't happen in your
[48:32] church and your group or your people you
[48:34] don't believe it
[48:35] that's what I told you I used to pray
[48:37] for that brother that used to come here
[48:39] wrote all over the country I pray that
[48:41] God would not do nothing when he's here
[48:43] why because people back then will start
[48:45] running now you can have the dead race
[48:47] every day in this church and it wouldn't
[48:49] add one person to this building
[48:55] oh yeah you get these Great Signs and
[48:57] want to start out
[48:58] we'll get to it later in the message
[48:59] when the signs and wonder starts
[49:01] happening and people see it's going to
[49:03] start happening over in that Baptist
[49:04] Church too I can quote wrote a random
[49:07] remember
[49:11] come on I thought brother random said
[49:13] the third pool was for the bride
[49:16] and the church
[49:21] and to the totally long
[49:24] but do we quote him
[49:26] no we quote what we want
[49:28] oh how can we have we don't have Divine
[49:31] hate and how long can we outrage and
[49:33] fight
[49:34] how can we have faith to be changed the
[49:37] quicker this body be taken away look I
[49:40] believe there's a church
[49:43] on this road tonight
[49:47] a power of the Living God
[49:50] that men will speak the word here and
[49:53] there
[49:54] and it'll flash like lightning amen
[49:57] and the church is coming out
[50:00] not a psychological it's everybody
[50:03] pronounce that word not some of this put
[50:05] on make-believe but a real true genuine
[50:09] anointed Holy Ghost called out Church
[50:14] 53.
[50:18] not the earliest thing find
[50:22] but that's pretty early isn't it
[50:25] brought around was looking forward to
[50:26] that
[50:27] okay now we're going to read a few
[50:30] and I know what most people are thinking
[50:31] is
[50:33] at that point where Jim seals
[50:39] he he was talking about them Shields
[50:41] then would one day be open
[50:43] I've got a bunch in here if I got time
[50:45] to read if I don't want to get up this
[50:46] evening
[50:49] a worried after the seals he's talking
[50:51] about
[50:53] a great church
[50:56] if it was the sealed why is he talking
[50:58] about it later
[51:00] I believe in the seals come on folks
[51:03] I believe it's part of it
[51:06] all right look what he says here on 1953
[51:09] God's commissioning Moses
[51:12] go ahead number
[51:14] that's number 11. there you go
[51:18] I have a great faith to believe that one
[51:21] day
[51:21] before the coming of the Lord
[51:24] and our little differences will be
[51:26] settled
[51:28] God may have to let communism sweep us
[51:30] together
[51:33] but something will take place that'll
[51:35] make us all one heart
[51:38] in one Accord
[51:42] now if you don't look around now and see
[51:45] the way this economy is in situations is
[51:48] going exactly and don't see that he
[51:51] looked back there and saw this here
[51:52] I mean you blind
[51:57] if we can't have faith now for healing
[51:59] see there that's all they quote on this
[52:01] one the little quote we can't have fight
[52:05] now for healing and we're going to have
[52:07] a Rapture in faith hmm
[52:09] we've got to have faith for the little
[52:11] things first
[52:12] amen
[52:15] right
[52:17] before the great thing
[52:20] what does the Bible say you can't keep
[52:22] up with the footman what about when the
[52:23] Horseman get here
[52:26] if you can't do good in the times of
[52:28] what is plenty what in the swell in the
[52:29] Jordan or whatever there's another
[52:30] scripture in there
[52:32] what do you see
[52:35] so there will be something that'll cause
[52:38] that's on that's in God's Providence
[52:42] so it must be if it's a Providence means
[52:44] it's planned
[52:46] set forth and going to take place right
[52:49] I do not know
[52:51] but I've seen her this demonstration of
[52:53] it recently
[52:54] you know it's probably referring beyond
[52:56] the curtain of time I don't know none of
[52:58] my business
[53:00] we'll look at the next one
[53:05] this is taken from
[53:07] now these are 53 53 53
[53:11] I've received that daughter Prophet John
[53:15] and oh God grant today that when we can
[53:18] all come together and see all those nine
[53:20] spiritual gifts moving through the
[53:22] church operating the whole church body
[53:24] then we have the then we'll have the
[53:27] rapture
[53:32] yeah there's the simple things coming
[53:35] into the Rapture right
[53:37] then it'll be called out
[53:42] you're reading it
[53:45] there's evidently a culling coming
[53:47] you know because it's gonna be cold out
[53:51] and the way we used to do was culling
[53:53] things as we we used to raise potatoes
[53:55] and you take your sweet potatoes and you
[53:57] burn them in the ground and
[53:59] and you you make sure you put good
[54:01] potatoes there with no scars or broken
[54:05] places some of these older ones remember
[54:07] because if you put one in there with a
[54:09] rotten spot or a place that could cable
[54:11] rotten you know what it's going to do
[54:12] rotten every one of them you've heard
[54:14] the old story about the rotten apple you
[54:16] know one in the barrel Roger whole Lane
[54:19] so he's evidently going to call it out
[54:23] then it'll be cold out and we'll have
[54:25] the rapture
[54:28] remember he's prophesying
[54:33] are you with me
[54:35] if we can't have faith for Divine
[54:37] Healing how are we going to have faith
[54:39] for rapturing faith
[54:42] the church has got a ways to go yet
[54:47] well that's where we're stopped amen
[54:50] we got all that well we just meet the
[54:51] people to death
[54:53] you ain't got nothing I ain't got
[54:54] nothing
[54:57] but what did he say
[54:59] but I believe God will do it
[55:06] evidently he's looking forward to it
[55:08] look at the next one
[55:10] 13.
[55:12] these are still in 53.
[55:17] he said it off the message
[55:20] um God talked to Moses
[55:22] huh
[55:24] I believe that the age has come now
[55:27] the miraculous
[55:29] the phenomenal whatever I used to
[55:31] pronounce it
[55:32] the baptism of the spirit and power and
[55:36] signs and wonders
[55:37] it's great pouring out of God's spirit
[55:40] in the last days
[55:42] and that's the thing that'll bring Faith
[55:45] into the people
[55:47] that'll take a Rapture in faith they'll
[55:50] take the church into Glory
[55:52] he believed it back there
[55:55] look the next one
[56:00] let's see we're going up 54 I think on
[56:01] this one
[56:03] he's going to have his provided way
[56:06] now we're moving right in right on into
[56:09] another great age
[56:13] he was looking forward to something
[56:15] wasn't it
[56:16] coming of the Rapture of the church
[56:19] and this we're living in the time of the
[56:21] restoration of the gifts
[56:22] they stumbled many of the big fine
[56:24] churches and sent nazareness backwards
[56:27] it made Fanatics out of a lot of
[56:28] Pentecost
[56:30] but just the same God's moving right on
[56:33] bringing in the rap string faith for his
[56:36] church
[56:37] that's right so tonight I represent that
[56:39] faith
[56:41] the faith that was once delivered to the
[56:44] Saints
[56:45] in the way of a Divine Healing gift
[56:48] look at the next one 59. what was the
[56:52] Holy Ghost given for
[56:55] if you feel the least tug don't turn it
[56:57] away
[56:58] what is the Holy Ghost God in you what's
[57:01] it for to continue his work among his
[57:03] people to bring his church together to
[57:05] bring a church to a place in this day
[57:08] far beyond the Lutheran methodists and
[57:11] Pentecostals
[57:13] into a place to an adopt a adoption and
[57:17] a Rapture in Grace
[57:19] that when this part of the church
[57:22] and watch them is down there come up
[57:24] Laura
[57:25] when the spirit moves into this church
[57:27] here
[57:28] it'll just raise
[57:30] and it'll bring forth bringing forth all
[57:33] of the redeemed let's touch that spirit
[57:37] old Lutheran that stood for the truth is
[57:40] going to raise why
[57:42] because something's going to happen
[57:45] to you and I
[57:48] let me read five
[57:50] all right look at the next one
[57:52] is this the sign of the end sir
[57:58] look what he says
[58:01] you remember what that was you remember
[58:03] this is the time of the end that's when
[58:04] all of the visions and the things
[58:06] happened and he was to go west and
[58:07] connect and come back
[58:13] is that really them seven Thunders
[58:15] fixing to utter out something
[58:17] that's a little group that is gathered
[58:19] together will receive a rapturing faith
[58:22] and go in the rapture
[58:24] when he comes
[58:28] and there's your lord descended from
[58:29] heaven with a shout we'll get to that
[58:31] in about two more messages down the road
[58:35] or we'll be changed as quick as those
[58:37] angels come
[58:40] and we know the Thunder's the voice of
[58:43] God when the seals broke to the prophet
[58:44] and him preaching and so we don't have
[58:46] no problems right
[58:48] now
[58:50] let's get one into seal book go to the
[58:52] next one 17 in the first seal
[58:56] paragraph 75. I believe that through
[58:59] those seven Thunders will be revealed in
[59:01] the last days in order to get the bride
[59:02] together for Rapture and faith
[59:05] all right
[59:07] because what we got right now
[59:10] we wouldn't able to be able to do it
[59:14] I agree with that quote but don't take
[59:17] out all of this and this and just read
[59:18] that quote that's right you're killing
[59:21] the people
[59:25] look there's something we've got to step
[59:28] father
[59:30] we can't have enough faith for Divine
[59:32] Healing hardly we've got to have enough
[59:34] Faith to be changed in a moment to be
[59:37] swept up out of this Earth
[59:39] and we'll find that after a while the
[59:43] Lord willing find where it's written
[59:47] all right
[59:50] now let's go after the CEOs in case
[59:53] you're thinking that all of the things
[59:55] brother Brown and was looking forward in
[59:56] his early Ministry was just the opening
[59:59] of them seals but what was he looking
[1:00:01] forward to after the seals broke
[1:00:08] let's read
[1:00:10] Feist
[1:00:12] look
[1:00:14] once more
[1:00:16] 63 11 17.
[1:00:21] after the seals broke Lord Jesus Great
[1:00:24] Master Of Life The Shepherd of the sheep
[1:00:26] come forth Lord these people are
[1:00:28] hungering they're thirsting Lord
[1:00:30] years I've wanted to see this happen
[1:00:33] maybe it will
[1:00:35] just once more Lord one more great move
[1:00:38] of the spirit
[1:00:40] One More Time Lord and the church might
[1:00:43] receive the rapturing faith to go in
[1:00:46] granted Lord make known that you are
[1:00:49] with us and we will praise thee for it
[1:00:52] in Jesus name we ask it
[1:00:56] just once more Lord
[1:01:00] look the next one
[1:01:03] three kinds of Believers three 63 12 24.
[1:01:08] now what kind of sound from heaven
[1:01:10] that'll take such a baptism of the Holy
[1:01:12] Spirit into that bride that will take
[1:01:15] her from the earth in a rapturing Grace
[1:01:19] God promised him
[1:01:23] brother Dale are you looking forward to
[1:01:25] a great baptism of the Holy Spirit from
[1:01:27] Heaven always have since I read the
[1:01:29] prophet
[1:01:34] well you don't believe it's all back
[1:01:35] there with him no
[1:01:38] because this is after the seals broke
[1:01:42] he said he didn't care I'm a scientist
[1:01:44] sometimes there is a heaven and there is
[1:01:46] a literal Jesus Christ
[1:01:48] the Earth that will come in a body form
[1:01:51] to receive his church to himself no
[1:01:53] matter how old the story seems it's
[1:01:56] still the truth God said it that's
[1:01:58] that's what Believers believe go to the
[1:02:02] next one the token 1963 11 28.
[1:02:08] I'm looking for a time of a breaking
[1:02:10] forth of the spirit of God
[1:02:13] in these last days that we're now living
[1:02:15] in
[1:02:16] for another surge
[1:02:18] of the Holy Spirit into the church
[1:02:21] for a rapturing faith
[1:02:23] just before it comes
[1:02:26] and everything is sitting straight in
[1:02:28] order for that
[1:02:29] and I believe that we're now at the time
[1:02:32] that the word should have preeminence
[1:02:35] I believe that the time to lay us out
[1:02:38] our Creeds and our thoughts and come
[1:02:41] back to the work what is the rapture
[1:02:46] it's an excellent spiritual food and due
[1:02:48] season 65.
[1:02:52] I want you to get built up now in the
[1:02:55] this holy Oracles of God in the faith
[1:02:58] the faith of the hour the faith it's
[1:02:59] going to take more faith than ever was
[1:03:01] in any age
[1:03:03] or this has to be Rapture and Faith be
[1:03:06] taken up and so we want you to believe
[1:03:08] tonight in all that you have seen heard
[1:03:12] and the word that you have heard
[1:03:13] preached the signs and the Wonders that
[1:03:16] you have seen done we want you to
[1:03:18] accumulate all that together in your
[1:03:21] heart and consider it whether if that be
[1:03:24] God
[1:03:25] or not
[1:03:27] okay
[1:03:29] after the seals broke
[1:03:33] okay two more
[1:03:36] or what else we'll go
[1:03:39] we'll leave that
[1:03:42] you remember when we used it in the
[1:03:45] message the other week
[1:03:48] or what faith really is
[1:03:53] according to Hebrews 11.
[1:03:57] he said it's the substance of things so
[1:03:59] far
[1:04:01] and I tried my best to explain as the
[1:04:03] prophet has explained it
[1:04:05] that
[1:04:08] the varieties
[1:04:11] we're supposed to be built on Revelation
[1:04:15] we're supposed to be built under thus
[1:04:16] saith the Lord the revealed word
[1:04:20] we're supposed to seek God for a
[1:04:22] revelation more than anything else
[1:04:24] how many of those are those are quotes
[1:04:26] right
[1:04:28] but on the rep Rapture message and he
[1:04:30] said but to the church the bride
[1:04:32] the Rapture is a revelation to her
[1:04:38] it's revealed to her
[1:04:40] that the Revelation the true bride of
[1:04:42] Christ will be waiting for that
[1:04:44] Revelation on the rapture
[1:04:48] that's paragraphed
[1:04:51] 65 because it is
[1:04:54] of the rapture
[1:04:58] the right is to be waiting for the
[1:05:00] revelation of the rapture
[1:05:05] you know if you're waiting for a bus
[1:05:06] don't go to the train station
[1:05:13] go to the bus depot
[1:05:15] you take it
[1:05:17] wait for the bus
[1:05:22] right
[1:05:23] you said I'm ready I'm at the bus
[1:05:25] station you got your ticket no I don't
[1:05:27] think I need you I'll get it when he
[1:05:28] gets here
[1:05:33] Bush might pull up and run off without
[1:05:35] you
[1:05:38] 40 something years we've had time of
[1:05:40] preparation
[1:05:45] for God to do something I want to read
[1:05:47] this last one
[1:05:49] which is taken from Oneness number 23
[1:05:52] brother
[1:05:53] at 189 I want to just read this
[1:05:58] what is it
[1:06:00] you got to get with the word
[1:06:02] get yourself killed out
[1:06:04] I'm persuaded that many of us friends
[1:06:06] have received the Holy Ghost
[1:06:08] nobody received just we we just receive
[1:06:11] enough holy ghost in us to make us to a
[1:06:14] place that we don't want to lie we don't
[1:06:17] want to steal
[1:06:19] we don't want to do anything
[1:06:24] now is that what you've heard preach
[1:06:26] basically all of your life since you've
[1:06:28] been in the message
[1:06:34] foreign
[1:06:38] fiber of his church
[1:06:41] he wants to feel your thinking he wants
[1:06:43] to fill your mind he wants to fill every
[1:06:46] bit of you just make you completely dead
[1:06:48] to yourself
[1:06:50] or to your thinking just to surrender in
[1:06:53] God till his words just living right
[1:06:55] through you
[1:06:57] you don't know nothing else but God's
[1:07:00] word
[1:07:01] our life
[1:07:03] see you don't know nothing else but
[1:07:05] God's word
[1:07:06] just stay right with his word it's life
[1:07:11] my words are life say Jesus he's placed
[1:07:13] it with them teachers believe in the
[1:07:16] Bible prophets that say the truth that
[1:07:19] say show the same prophecy that they
[1:07:21] always did down through the age what's
[1:07:24] he done he's showing himself among them
[1:07:27] confirming his word
[1:07:30] and his word is the kingdom of God is
[1:07:32] God's word made Power
[1:07:36] we're looking for something
[1:07:40] but do we know what we're looking for
[1:07:43] right
[1:07:45] like I said we'll pick up this afternoon
[1:07:46] a little talk that
[1:07:49] remember
[1:07:52] Jesus does all three of these things the
[1:07:54] shout divorce of Archangel Trump as he's
[1:07:56] descending
[1:08:03] and Paul in Thessalonians
[1:08:06] his dealing with being caught up
[1:08:10] Paul in Thessalonians does not use the
[1:08:13] word change
[1:08:23] that's in Corinthians
[1:08:30] so then the Lord can do all three and
[1:08:32] it's right here
[1:08:35] and we ain't got to change yet
[1:08:38] it could be right here right now
[1:08:44] waiting on you and I
[1:08:46] to see it by revelation
[1:08:49] waiting on you and I to recognize Who We
[1:08:52] Are
[1:08:59] right brother Carly it is he that hath
[1:09:01] made us where the college said that
[1:09:02] years ago and it really stuck with me is
[1:09:04] he that hath made us and not we are
[1:09:05] sales we are his people sheep of his
[1:09:07] pastor
[1:09:13] whatever we are he's made us
[1:09:17] it's not something we've done
[1:09:20] we're not goody goodies and we were
[1:09:22] brought in the message not we're batty
[1:09:24] baddies because that's where we are
[1:09:27] the Baddie Baddie Gods is the one comes
[1:09:29] into the message the goody goodies don't
[1:09:30] need the message
[1:09:31] come on right
[1:09:34] so we don't glory in the Baddie baddies
[1:09:36] but we're glory in the baddies make
[1:09:37] goody
[1:09:38] okay
[1:09:41] because it's what he does with us
[1:09:48] what about taking a bunch of garbage
[1:09:49] cans and making a beautiful wife
[1:09:54] oh wonderful
[1:09:56] God's Great Jewel
[1:10:01] what do you think about it
[1:10:06] sitting in Heavenly places
[1:10:10] you know what I can say this without one
[1:10:13] ounce of remorse or talk
[1:10:16] involved in it
[1:10:18] that ever since I've been in this
[1:10:19] message I've been in a rapture
[1:10:24] how many of you have ever seen me really
[1:10:27] down and out
[1:10:31] don't say I hadn't been down and out I
[1:10:34] said how many of you have seen it
[1:10:36] my wife is the closest one
[1:10:40] she'll tell you in a hurry that I'll get
[1:10:42] over it
[1:10:46] and it doesn't stop me in the word of
[1:10:48] God
[1:10:51] when things start going rough I start
[1:10:54] studying more
[1:10:58] I start reading more I start praying
[1:11:00] more
[1:11:01] brother now you don't like me when I'm
[1:11:03] down and out I'm just down and out I
[1:11:05] don't feel like praying and saying what
[1:11:07] do you feel like doing
[1:11:12] whoopee
[1:11:18] you know I mean watch the whole world
[1:11:20] supposed to quit because you're down and
[1:11:22] out
[1:11:27] and came to see me and he used to go to
[1:11:29] church with us and he'd heard I've got
[1:11:30] sick and just after we left the Baptist
[1:11:33] Church
[1:11:34] and he'd heard it I was sick you know me
[1:11:36] if I was at home from work and doing
[1:11:37] things and in the bed you know I sick
[1:11:41] and he came in and we sat down and we
[1:11:44] started talking
[1:11:46] after a while he said I thought I'd come
[1:11:49] over here because you're sick
[1:12:00] I've had days until his brother Gary
[1:12:04] wrote that song from the bottom looking
[1:12:06] up
[1:12:08] that I couldn't even say I was at the
[1:12:09] bottom
[1:12:11] it was way below there
[1:12:13] but I never let you know it
[1:12:16] why
[1:12:18] because I'm not supposed to let you know
[1:12:20] it
[1:12:23] I'll go through the house and reach up
[1:12:24] in the medicine cabinet and very rare
[1:12:26] but sometimes I'll take a
[1:12:28] aspirin my wife immediately when she
[1:12:31] comes through and sees she said what's
[1:12:33] wrong with you
[1:12:35] that's how I got a little headache
[1:12:39] she even gets on to me when I go to the
[1:12:41] doctor so when I go into the doctor and
[1:12:43] he said how you doing I'm doing
[1:12:45] wonderful
[1:12:47] she said well what are you doing at the
[1:12:48] doctor if you're going to tell him how
[1:12:49] wonderful you are
[1:12:52] so I developed the way of saying it I
[1:12:54] said he's how you doing I said I'm doing
[1:12:56] wonderful but I got a bad cold can you
[1:12:58] get me over this or help me
[1:13:01] why
[1:13:03] because I'm sure they sit there and look
[1:13:05] at you if it's God's doing fine what's
[1:13:07] he doing here
[1:13:11] do you understand
[1:13:14] but yet we've got that pity party

[1:15:55] I thought we were resurrected sitting

[1:15:58] resurrected sitting in Heavenly places
[1:16:01] in Christ Jesus
[1:16:08] why don't we live like Heavenly places
[1:16:11] and act like Heavenly places
[1:16:15] right
[1:16:17] well us trying a song now what we're

[1:16:33] see I never heard a song when I do like
[1:16:35] that of you
[1:16:43] but you know the kind of songs we like
[1:16:45] is
[1:16:46] I know I got a memory and I'm sorry I
[1:16:49] remember years ago there was a guy wrote
[1:16:50] a song and I can't think of the name of
[1:16:52] it or nothing about it the old country
[1:16:54] music guy and he sung a song and when he
[1:16:57] finished the song Some of you probably
[1:16:58] know the song and tell me the name but
[1:16:59] when he finished he sent it in to be
[1:17:01] recorded and they sent it back to him
[1:17:03] and said
[1:17:04] we don't record songs like that because
[1:17:06] there's no murder no rape no killings no
[1:17:08] lying no cheating No Stealing none of
[1:17:10] those things is in your song
[1:17:13] he sat down and rewrote the song and
[1:17:16] said Grandma got killed granddaughter
[1:17:19] when she was a drunk
[1:17:21] you know what made a hit
[1:17:26] right
[1:17:27] that's what everybody wants to hear how
[1:17:31] bad you are
[1:17:33] I've told you this and I mean it there's
[1:17:34] more crime solved
[1:17:36] because of the loudmouth people who've
[1:17:39] done the crimes can't keep their mouth
[1:17:40] shut
[1:17:41] they gotta go tell somebody what they've
[1:17:44] done because it's hard to live in a
[1:17:46] shell when nobody's as bad as you are
[1:17:48] so you want to find somebody as bad as
[1:17:50] you are
[1:17:53] tell them how bad you are and you don't
[1:17:55] want nobody like me to say that's down
