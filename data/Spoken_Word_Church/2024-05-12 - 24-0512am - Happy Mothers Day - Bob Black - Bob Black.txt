to be handing out no yes okay all right so um look for that from Terence I think so but uh God bless you we're just going to take a little scripture this morning from 1 Corinthians chapter 15 and uh somebody in the back will saying are are you going to preach on Mothers today and I you know sometimes we'll take a different topic or whatever but yes I am I'm going to be talking about mothers today um I think I think it's a worthy topic and uh Lord willing I'll have something else to talk about after brother Aaron took all of my scriptures and and just everything but that was that was really good I think that just set set the stage for the day and and I sure appreciate that let's just go to the Lord in prayer Lord we're so grateful to be able to gather around your word today Lord God and speak something Lord to edify your people Lord and I pray God that you'll just anoint my lips Lord God to give some encouragement Lord and just give some give a little pass some roses out to all the mothers and moms in here today Lord and maybe listening in on the internet Lord Jesus Lord we've got so much to be grateful for and we've got so much to be grateful for that you've given your life for us you given you give your life and and certainly know we know that we the reason we've got life here is because that you give us the mamas you give us some mamas that that we could come through and uh that that can mother us and and take care of us when we're babies and set us on the right path in life like brother Aaron was talking about Lord we're so grateful for you today Lord and so grateful for the mothers that you given to us and we ask Lord today that you'll just bless us Lord Jesus bless this little service I pray God that you'll feel welcome to move Among Us Lord Jesus that you be welcome Lord here this morning Lord and just be with a little group up there in Ohio is brother Wade's Minister and Lord guide his words Lord Jesus and be with that group and bless him Lord mightily Lord in your name we pray amen so uh my topic today is Happy Mother's Day so verse one of 1 Corinthians chapter 15 says moreover Brethren I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you which also you have received and wherein you stand by which also ye are saved if you keep in memory what I preached unto you unless you have believed in vain for I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word I think everything everything that we do and everything that we everything that we say and our whole Christian journey of course is based on what Christ did when he died and Rose from the grave on the third day to prove that he conquered death hell and the grave and to make a way for that same life to be given back to us so now he gave his eternal life to us this morning I'm talking about life I'm talking about I I just want to maybe just take some time to just meditate on on life I I think that's a worthy topic to think about on Mother's Day you think about in the in the Garden of Eden uh uh that uh God kind of set up the pattern so that there would be a father and a mother and those two together would work together to bring life and he set it up that way that and we're all here this morning because we had a mother I I sure thank God for real mamas real mothers you know in the in the Garden of Eden the the the path was set so that you know you I thinking about this morning just sitting there in the office you when you sit there in the in the hospital watching your babies be born and all that travail and everything the the monitor beeping and everything every every few minutes and you know it seems like in that moment what a horrible time as life is coming forth there life and but then after after the the all of said done there's a little baby being held in Mama's arms and and uh you know we talk we know the process that brother Bram laid out that that uh in in her bellies the the baby's growing and growing and twitching muscles and everything and then the baby's born it comes forth well where's life at maybe the doctor will spank spank it and then the the baby takes that first breath and life comes in life and so we we're born with that that caral life that we give that God has given to us and God laid out that process that we come from Mama but you you see see God made it God made it that way that Mama would be first with life Mama's first mama is the first one with that child all that time she's that little baby's growing in her womb and and you know you know what people sometimes uh they they don't when the baby's growing in Mama's womb they don't recognize limits and things and people walk up to and try to put their hand on the belly and you know cuz they want to feel the movement they want to feel the heartbeat but mama's the one that feels that heartbeat first and Mama be laying there in that bed at night and she can feel the heartbeat feel the movement or maybe not feel the heartbeat but you can hear it when you when you you know you put the sonogram on there and maybe you put your ear up to the belly and you can you can hear that heartbeat and Mama's the one that feels it first and she's the one that experiences it first and brother Brandon would say the first one that receives you in this life is your mother no one could touch you because you're conceived and she Bears you under her heart now you think about how special a mama is that all that time that the the baby's growing and and maturing inside the mama that it's right there under her heart and she's going to have a special relationship with that baby he said she's first she's the first hands that touch you and wipes backs the tears out of your eye she's the first one to Pat you and to love you and to CP over you she's the first one to hear your heartbeat she's the first one to feel you move isn't that interesting just to meditate on that that that there in the night hours maybe that baby's kicking her in the ribs and Daddy's over there sleeping fast and he's getting ready for work the next morning but he he he don't have nothing to say about that experience he doesn't know about getting kicked under the ribs or nothing daddy don't but Mama does Mama's the one that she goes through all that process and all that pain and all that delivery cuz it's set up that way God made the mama special she's the first one she's the first one to feed you when you come out that I'm sorry Daddy can't help that I mean there's some things that Daddy can help you know I remember we' wake up in the middle of the night when when Zoe and Kaye were born and and and and the twins you know that that that nurse and everything and and then Kaye had always I could help cuz Kaye had always she'd get run out of food so I'd had to go down and heat up a little bottle and everything and but there's some things that Daddy can do but but you know really it's Mama's the one that feeds you see Mama's the one that nurses you and it's the first you it's usually Mama's voice that the the the first voice that baby recognizes all that time in that growing in that womb the the little baby's listening to Mama's voice and hearing her hearing her talk and listening to the outside noises and listening to the music that she likes and maybe listening to a tape that Mama's playing and listening to her read the Bible and things and listening to her sing to it and everything and it's when it's going to be Mama's voice that that baby recognizes and mama is usually when that baby's born it's mama that's usually the first one to recognize those little Milestones that brother Aaron was talking about the baby will take take a little first step and and Mama sometimes is the easiest thing for the baby to say so maybe it'll be the first word that the baby says and Mama ends up being first I thank God for real mamas this morning a't it wonderful that God set it up the way that you look you could look back and and see that you come from a real mama that Mama took care of you and Mama Mama was the first mama mama brought you into this world Mama gave you life and she was there to go through all those labor pains and all those things and that's why I think it's worthy it's worthy to give honor to your mother sometimes people will say well my mama talked bad about the message or my mama said something my mom's not really even a Christian but yet she went through all that for you and she set up your life in motion and maybe she might have even said some hurtful words to You and done some things wrong but yet still she gave you life and she raised you up and she shut you on the course of life and so she's got to be worthy of honor honor your father and mother and God will give you long days on the Earth and I I I think maybe this morning that might help you this morning to think about that your mother really is worthy of honor maybe if you don't even think she's worthy of honor but she give you life if nothing else she give you life and she brought you into this world and brother BR want talk about how his well I'll read this scripture in the Bible in Isaiah 49:15 it says can a woman forget her suckling child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb now listen to what Isaiah God is speaking through Isaiah can a woman forget her sucking child after all that labor and all that travail and having it grow in her womb and and all those things raising up the child and it come from her and she she saw it be born and raised it up how can a mama a real mama forget her little baby and yet he said yay they may forget a woman can't forget her child but he said even if they do forget yet I will not forget thee and now we're going to see you're going to see as we kind of go along the scripture how how that God the word of God is almost like our mother and you can see how a mother in the natural can't forget you but yet God can't forget you even more even more on top of that that God we come from God and we're going back to God and if you come from God how can he forget you he can't a woman can't forget her child and how can God forget you oh maybe this morning you might be going through a bad time maybe you might be sitting on the ash Heep like job maybe you from I forget everything forgotten about you but yet God cannot forget you and brother Brown will talk about how his mother I'm talking about a real Mama this morning these old country Backwoods mamas that didn't have nothing how you know didn't have didn't have nothing but some grease to put on their kids eyes in the morning to keep the keep the mat from foring it didn't have no food Harley but some like like the old Jerry Clow joke some old cat head biscuits that you make in the morning sh they wern't whopping them on the counter to break them things open but they good old a real mama was making their biscuits from scratch and brother Ram will talk about how his mother would walk away from the table so he could have something to eat why because a real mama is going to make sacrifices now we talked so many times in Sunday school and whatnot about how a real Christian Life is full of sacrifices well how about a real Christian Mama to make sacrifices and that's why a real mother is worthy of honor you think look back through your own life and recognize all the sacrifices that your mama made for you all the sacri I remember just growing up I'm going to throw some roses at my mama this morning she might be listening in but I remember when when we were little she she quit her job and she she raised us and when we got older about in high school or middle school something like that she did go back to work but we'd come home and I remember when I was a kid just always thinking like we she she'd work as a school teacher and then she'd come home and she would cook dinner for us like I I was I I remember thinking she cook okra and chopped steak and mashed potatoes every night I was like what I'm I'm talking about sacrifices now sacrifices because it's a real a real mama is going to sacrifice for her children when she's tired she's going to pray at night when she's tired she's going to sit around that like that Fifth Gospel that brother Aaron was talking about and let sit her children around her knees like like Mama Wesley John Wesley's Mama gather all the kids around so that to kind of give them a little a little Bible story and teach them that's a real mother a real mama is going to make sacrifices and that's why they're worthy of honor why cuz a real mother a real mother there's something in there's something in a real mother that she just loves life she loves even you know when we I just I you know I got three daughters and there at the house we got all these little animals and things and we got little rabbits and little a little Chihuahua dog and you know like but why because there's something in these little girl the girls will just take the little rabbit and they'll hold it you know and they they take the Chihuahua dog and put it like a little baby because why because there's something in a girl that that she wants to be a mama and I'm that's nothing to be ashamed about now what one of my girls was telling me the other day you know you talk about what what do you want to do in life and and whatnot one of my girls was telling me the other day I want to be a mama you know the rest of the world thinks that that that ain't nothing good about that but I I I think I think that's something to put up on the pedestal because that's one of the to to to to want to have a desire to bring life into the world and mother it and set it on the right course of life that's that's something to be admired and you see a real mama loves life a real mama now it it might be Troublesome to go through all those labor pains and hear that monitor beeping in her ear when she's in the hospital with the baby coming forth but yet she loves life and you see these these fake masam these unreal mamas like I saw in the news the other day this this woman took her baby and put it in a in a garbage bag and put it behind a Walmart or something because that's that's not a real Mama a real mama like jocked praying down in Egypt while all the brother B said they were witches Gathering up all the all the uh Israelite babies and and and trying to kill them and stuff that that ain't a real that ain't a real Mama but brother R would say how mother lives little babies how she puts him on the chin mother would wash you now you think about what think about just picture this in your mind now mama just loves loves the little babies cuz there's some something in her she going to pick that little baby up and just put it right up under her chin and hold it all through the midnight hours losing sleep because there's something in her that she just that's how she's made mother would wash you and kiss you and would say how pretty you was and put you to bed at night if a little door would be open a little draft coming through something like that she'd run real quick and shut the door cover up the little baby and you know she taking it she loved you see she loved you she loved that poor little thing that God had give her that was helpless and it couldn't help itself so she loved that little baby and she just kiss her little babies and play with them because she was a real mother oh that's a real mama that'll gather up her little baby and and and every every three or four hours in the middle of the night it keep waking up and Mama's there to feed it and take care of it and swallow it and change it diapers and all those things are real mother Mother Down in Egypt jocked praying down in oh that's a real mother a real mother that would pray that God would give her child and pray that God would lead her and pray and brother Brown would say those old witches would go in there that killing babies and take their little feet and bang them up against the wall and kill them and throw them in the crocodiles the poor mother would get on her knees and she'd cry oh don't take my baby don't take my baby oh what a time they were having that's unreal mothers but there's something in a real mother that wants to take care of life now I I want to say this morning that sisters there's there's where you find you know everybody's got a purpose everybody's got a calling in their life and sisters this morning there's where you'll find your real calling and your real purpose to bring life into the world and I like how brother Aaron was framing it this morning that maybe maybe in your life you you never had the opportunity to have children maybe maybe you're you know you're a step mother and and all those thing we're putting all that Under the Umbrella of mothers this morning because maybe you're maybe you're a aunt and you're you know sometimes these large families mama can't really be their mother you know if you got 12 kids or nine kids or whatever running around and an older sister will step in and maybe that sister don't really have any kids of herself but yet she's still a mama I I remember Monica talking about one she's got one of her older sisters that would change their diapers and she was the mama and you know and and almost like she had a different relationship with that sister than the other sister because she was more like a mama so that's what I'm putting all that under that umbrella I'm I'm not trying to put nobody out your mom but being a mama taking care of that life taking care that that is where you'll find your real calling and purpose now that's what Paul told Timothy in 1 Timothy 2:15 when he said she shall be saved in childbearing if they continue in faith and charity and Holiness with sobriety that's one of them scriptures that we stumble over a lot of times am I going to be saved because I have children but listen to why my brother B said he said not by having a baby makes her saved but because that she's raising children doing her Duty oh when you find yourself falling in line with your purpose and your purpose this this is your purpose oh that's why we give real honor to these sisters because you're you're right in line with what God wants you to do and listen what he said he said not raising cats dogs and what more to take the place of a child as they do today giving it a mother's love so that she can go out and run around all night some people do that sorry but they do it that's awful rude for me to say but the truth is the truth they don't want a baby to be tied down with it now there's a real mother that don't mind being tied down by a baby that don't mind it but you see my my girls they go home and they pick up them rabbits and things and the Little Chihuahua dog and there's a time and a place for that but one day they'll come to a place of maturity and where life will just fall into place where they be able to fulfill the purpose in life that God has God has rais them up for it and they'll be able to hold a baby in their arms but you know you see you grow up and when you trade that when you trade that purpose well I'd rather have some little fruy dog instead of having a baby I'd rather hold a little fruy dog in my arms and baby that thing and push it around a little stroller and put nappy diapers on it and all sorts of nonsense like that you see you're you're betraying the purpose and the calling that God has for your life they listen he said they don't they don't want a baby to be tied down with it but in childbearing if she continues in faith Holiness and all sobriety she'll be saved why because she's doing what God called her to do God called your sisters to be a mother may mothers be real mothers this morning may brother r say may they dismiss that babysitter oh some of these things are a little bit rough ain't it it may they maybe may they dismiss that and I don't think any of us this morning are like so we wealthy and well off that we just got a a nanny there all the time to do the mothering and all that stuff for us but but certainly what he's saying is let's let's be real Mamas and take care of our kids cuz God raised us up for that purpose keep away from the barroom and throw down those cigarettes and dress like a mother ought to and be a real mother and a real mother is worthy of honor in Ephesians 6:2 it says honor thy father and mother which is the first commandment with promise now you think that all these Commandments going down the list Thou shalt not Thou shalt not and then it gets to honor thy father and mother and there's a promise that goes with it praise the Lord I my life can be extended if you want a long happy life on honor your father and mother and then you begin to realize how really evil it is to look at your father and mother with reproach and do them dishonor and look at them with hatefulness and things knowing that they brought you into the world and they went through all those labor pains and sacrificed and labored early on in their life and and and maybe walked away from the table so you could have something to eat and not give them honor honor your father and mother and brother Ram would say there is not enough honor that we could give to a mother which is why we're speaking on these things this morning brother R will say what that child will be will be based upon the way that mother starts that child on the path that it must travel mother has the responsibility from God to place that child on the right Road and I think that's why mothers has a special little touch I maybe maybe this morning you might think that you don't really have nothing to do in the great plan of God but you think that that you're like sitting back there with that little child and you can point it in the right direction and say go you can set it up and and get it situated maybe that child's going to be a minister one day maybe that child's going to lead many people to the to Christ maybe that child is going to have a great purpose one day or whatever it is maybe its purpose is going to be a to be a businessman to help the church to be able to uh send money overseas to be to missionary or whatever but whatever the purpose is that mother is framing that child's life to set it up to go in the direction to fulfill the purpose that God has for her you think about Moses where brother Ram said a man like Moses was because he had a Gods sent mother the reason oh Moses sitting there on his mama's knee being raised in Pharaoh's house but God positioned it so his real mama could sit there and tell him God has raised you up for a purpose and begin to testify to him and witness to him that I I've been I you your father and I prayed for you and and we were calling out to God that God was send to deliverer and framed it up that that Moses would know who he was because his mother framed up his life that's what helped mold the character that Moses was that's what a mother mother does is mold her children and set them on the right path you know we like to read maybe on Mother's Day that proverbs 31 that talks about a a good virtuous woman and everything but have you ever read how that starts off in Proverbs 31 ver verse one it says the words of King lmel and it says the prophecy that his mother taught him now that whole proverbs 31 that talks about a virtuous woman rising up taking care of her family all the things she does that whole thing that whole that whole proverb is about something that King lel's mama taught him that King lel's Mama fr named up his path and set things in motion so one day Kem glenil could WR be writing that down because as mama taught him in Proverbs 31:26 it says she openeth her mouth with wisdom now there's a good Mama that when you need some counsel and you need some advice you can turn to your mama and she'll say she'll she'll guide you on something that's happening in the schoolyard something how to deal with a bully how to deal with some kind of problem in your life H how to deal with that that young girl or that young boy that the children are talking to they can turn to Mama and say well what what should I do in this situation and in her tongue is the law of kindness why cuz she's setting the course of that child's life and you look back to a real a real good Godly mama and she'll she'll frame up their the the way that the children are so that everybody else can look at them and say they were raised right now isn't that a mama's that's the ultimate testimony that child was raised right when you can look at somebody that say it says yes sir no sir that's respectful of their Elders that honors their father and mother it's because that that Mama trained up the child that's what Proverbs 22:6 says train up a child in the way that he should go get a pointed in the right direction get them framed up so that when they're young they can see Mama and Daddy praying they can see a Godly house get them framed up in the way and when he is old he will not depart from it Charles Spurgeon said I can't tell you how much I owe to the solemn word of my good mother and and Charles Spurgeon said this now I I love this quote listen to this now he said I remember on one occasion her praying this now Lord if my children go on in their sins it won't be from my ignorance that they perish and my soul must bear a swift witness against them at the day of Judgment at if they lay not hold of Christ and Spurgeon said that thought of a mother's bearing Swift witnessed against me pierced my conscience and stirred my heart now that's a a real mother is she going to lay the truth down if if if at the end of the road after all I've done and all the travail of my life that my children get there at the end of at the judgment and say well I just never believed in Jesus that she's just going to have to bear a swift witness against him that even mama would do that no that's a real that's a that sounds harsh that sounds rough but thank God for for a real mama that will lay the truth out like that you know I think sometimes you what really Bears a good impression on young people is when they can hear somebody praying through the door hear those prayers coming through the closet door or the or the down the hall in the middle of the night and something begins to pierce your conscience and recognize that there's a need in your life and what like that scripture that brother Aaron read this morning your mother's instructions that she's you that she's framed up as you are sitting around her her her knees when you're young will actually be an ornament on your life my son hear the instruction of thy father says Proverbs Chapter 1 and forsake not the law of thy mother for they shall be an ornament of Grace under thy head and chains about thy neck now we joke about how we were when we were young you know in the schoolyard we'd have our our our our gold chains and those kind of ornaments and thing now you know that that's an ornament that you you wore in your in your sin and your debauchery and that kind of things but you think about an ornament that will actually set you apart from the world that will give you honor and distinction is if you obey what your mama said let's do what your mama said and it will make you different it will be it will be a a Grace and a beauty upon your life young ladies it will be uh it will be something that distinguishes you from others young men if you just do what your mom ISS cuz a good mama will set you on the right path Abraham Lincoln said like brother Aaron was saying again this morning I told y'all he was hitting all my points he said all that I am or hope to be I owe to my angel mother and you know Abraham Lincoln had a terrible bad start Abraham Lincoln's whole life was fraught with looked like just a lot of misery and and heartache and trouble and everything but he you now we look back and we say well he was one of the greatest presidents that this nation ever had and it was all because his life was framed by his mother he was poor he didn't have no background he didn't have any education or money or something that could have helped him like Washington had he was raised in that little old cabin in in up in Kentucky he never even owned a B book in his life until he got a Bible and Fox's book of Martyrs at 21 but one thing Abraham Lincoln had was a good mother and you we know his brother Aaron was laying out for us said his mama died his real mama died when he was about 9 years old and then he had that good stepmom that took care of him so he ended up having two good Mamas that framed up his life and set him on the path and he said I remember my mother's prayers and they have always follow me they have clung to me all my life he said in another place my earliest recollection of my mother is sitting at her feet by the Fireside at night listening to her tell the different stories and legends that she had gathered in her youth he said I feel that whatever may happen I shall never forget the maternal tenderness that stole into my soul in the darkest hours of my life in other words what he's saying there in that in The Darkest Hours of his life maybe when he's in the middle of that Civil War battle maybe in in the midst of all the the trouble that his wife gave him because he his wife was just a bitter peel most of his life but in those dark hours he'd remember what his mama said cuz his mama set him on the right course a child listens to its mother some little touch about that mother when it's hurt it'll go to the mother for consolation before it'll go to the father because why she was first mama was first why is it that a little child when it gets when it falls down and scrapes its knee it'll run to Mama mean old daddy a lot of times it'll just run right by but it'll run to Mama cuz Mama was first it come forth from mama mama was there to nurse it and you know scripture scripture compares the word to our mother and Galatians 4:26 it says Jerusalem which is above is free which is the mother of of us all we certainly we come from the word isn't that true how in the gospel when you it kind of parallels the natural in the natural when you you look on your you take one of those DNA tests or you you look in your genealogy record and you can you can find out who your mama and who your daddy is and then that gives you confidence well when you're born of the word you can look back and you say I I know where I come from I know that New Jerusalem now not old Jerusalem not old Jerusalem of this world but a New Jerusalem that come forth that was molded by the word word of God that God come he brought that down from God out of Heaven just like he brought your life from God down out of heaven and you know where you come from because you come from him and and the word also compares to our mother because elshad oh you you turn to Genesis chapter 7 17 when Abraham was on his walk and he come to a place where it says El shedi came and talked to him and said walk with me and be thou perfect and it used that term El shedi because and brother BR laid it out there that El shed means the breasted one it paints a picture in your mind of the alls sufficient God that whatever you have need of you can turn to him like a little child that's been born and you can turn to him for whatever you have need of whatever you have need of you know the Bible says in 1 Peter chapter 2:2 as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby so when we're born of the Gospel we turn to him we turn to El Shi just like a little baby at his mother's breast and draw everything that we have need of what are we drawing this morning we're drawing strength encouragement we're drawing help and Care from our mother from from the word of God just like a little baby you know we were we were talking the other day about how when a when a woman has a baby you don't give that baby water because it'll kill it but what you give it is that Mama's milk and in that Mama's milk is everything that it has need of and the same thing in the gospel the word of God has everything that you need in it what does it what does Mama's milk has it's got antibodies in it it's got white blood cells it got it's got Li something called lysozyme which which actually will repair it will it will fix things that are wrong it's got some it's got fatty acids it's got growth factors and hormones it's got stem cells that will repair things that are wrong in that baby it's got and it's got a dynamic composition that will change change as the baby's needs grow over time now you tell me that ain't what the word of God does as you as your needs change over time you will find and else sh I everything that you have need of that's why Philippians 4:19 says my God shall supply all your need according to his riches and Glory by Christ Jesus so whatever your need is this morning if you need healing if you need salvation if you need a little pick me up if you need a fresh Assurance you can turn like a little baby till L shed ey and draw from him everything that you need now now Mother's Day has become Mother's Day has just become just another date on the calendar it's become like we say another Hallmark holiday something where we could just go to the store and we pick up flowers and pick up cards to give to mama you know I was reading about how Anna Jarvis that the woman that found in Mother's Day she got so disillusioned with Mother's Day until she actually wanted it to be taken from the the calendar because she began to realize that Mother's Day ain't just something on the calendar well we we we we'll send a little quick text to our mama or or or send some some money or or gift like that that ain't what Mother's Day is about and you can see where brother Brandon would even say the same thing he said Mother's Day is supposed to be something that we honor our mothers 365 days of the year not when it just look kind of pops up into your head well I I guess I guess I need to need to think about Mama for the this quarter for 30 minutes this quarter every 3 months give her give her a little call home and maybe send us some money he said now Mother's Day like this is a racket make a lot of FL money out of flowers and things but he said Mother's Day should be every day not to send her a bunch of flowers on Mother's day but to love her and to care for her 365 days and nights Through The Years she'd appreciate a whole lot more now listen we I know on Mother's Day we give flowers and those kind of things but listen to what brother randam said she'd appreciate a whole lot more yes she'd appreciate a whole lot more just sit down and talk to her just a little bit write her a line Pat her on the cheek kiss her on the cheek tell her you love her now those are the things that matters to Mama what matters to Mama is you come sit down beside her on the rocking chair and on the front porch and just sit with her a little while and talk things over and tell her how much you appreciate her cuz Flowers and Things they'll fade away and they'll go that back to the dirt but what she wants is you that's what Mama appreciates he said it'll go a lot farther than all the flowers that you could buy from the floors now that's what the prophet God said that's what he said he said we might you think well we might have bought roses and cards and gave money and Gifts what mama would rather have you think about that this morning that Mama would rather have your words and your conversation and your fellowship and your companionship your presence your kiss your appreciation because it was your mother that gave you life she gave you life you think I I think sometimes it escapes the children sometime and myself included how much mamas love us how much it hurts them you know when we don't call home when we don't call them and talk to them and things after all the things that theyve give for us and sacrificed for us and all all the love that they' given for us they just want us they just want their children you think uh brother Brandon would use that example he said he he watched that Ten Commandments movie and it came to that place I went back and and scrolled through that scene the other night and I was watching it where Pharaoh's daughter in the movie they she her name was Bia she come in there to warn Moses real m Mama that Moses was going to come to see her and and then and and they're having that conversation don't tell Moses who your real mama is and beia was say and I give him wealth and Splendor you couldn't have G him nothing but the Slime Pit and Moses real mama says but I give him life I give him life that's what makes the difference I give him life and now Mama could BR give you Natural Life but God give us eternal life and I thank God this morning that because he rose on the third day that frames everything different we can look at the whole scene different because of life because God give us life thank God for life this morning thank God for the resurrection that he rose again on the third day because he rose from the dead it places us with the gospel armor at the Battlefront to take the place to fight because he rose from the dead it frames everything different we don't don't look at things with like uh depression and look look at things with misery anymore we don't look at Mama sitting there in her wheelchair or sitting there in the nursing home the same way that we do anymore because he rose from the grave on the third day it makes everything different because he lives I can look at everything differently the resurrection is the greatest of all the promises and the things of the scripture it's what everything is based on that Christ Rose from the grave and it it gives us a hope that mama with her gray hair and Mama sitting there in the maybe in a state of misery and things it ain't going to be like that forever it ain't going to be like that it promises brother would say it promises the great Union of our uniting together again it promises in the fading away of all sin it promises the fading away of all deformity the way they Place mother today as a pot of flour sitting by an old lady who was old and can't get up maybe and feeble and gray-headed and wrinkled as sitting in an armchair you know you go at maybe in the nursing home or maybe home where Mama's sitting there and she ain't like she used to be maybe maybe even this morning your mama's in the grave and you all you've got is memories of how she used to be but I thank God this morning that we've got that Resurrection promise it ain't going to stay like that forever someday these old weaken feeed grayheadedgamer someday that body down in the grave that laying there in the grave is going to come up and it ain't going to be like that forever and not only will mother sit there by herself but all of her family with her what a day that will be what a time it will be when we look upon the faces of those we have loved so well what a difference on that morning when we shall see our loved ones and watch what they'll be oh you see what a promise that resurrection power is is to know that one day everything is going to be changed everything all these heartaches and all the things of this life everything one day everything is going to be set in order and you'll see God as you really should see him you should you'll be able to fellowship with him as you really need want to as you really desire in your heart all this old carnality will drop away and you'll be able to really love him the way that you really should it'll now that that was what what were we talking about this morning we're talking about Mother's Day and that's going to be a Mother's Day when Mama and her kitties and all the family and friends are gathered around and everything's patched up the way that God really wants everything to be situated when we see them standing Yonder our loved ones our mothers our kindreds all our friends and to see them in their Immortal bodies their celestial bodies watching their character seeing how they conduct themselves with that sweetness and quietness no more nervous or frustrations to see them in standing in the likeness of the Lord Jesus Oh that'll be a wonderful day you know brother R said it'll take more than a resurrection it'll take an eternity to go around shaking hands and finding out things you think about even even I I was thinking about how many stories that I'm sure I don't even know about here sitting in church because you just you don't have time to talk to people and just in this in this little brief blink of an eye here that we have in life oh but one day we'll have all eternity to go around shaking hands and sit there sit there on the rocking chair porch of Eternity and talk things over that's what I'm talking about this morning things ain't going to look the way that they look now one day you'll see Mama the way that God wants you to wants her to be that's what brother R said he said then we shall see mother as God wants her then we shall see mother as God wants her that'll be a Mother's Day and oh think about this picture though it's wonderful that God can repair and fix up mama so she ain't got gray hair anymore and sit her so she's a young vibrant mother but that a all God wants to do cuz God ain't it ain't the picture ain't complete without you what makes Mama happy is you what makes Mama happy is her family God wants that whole family Circle to be there he said this is what brother Ry said mother would not be complete there without her family and I I hope this Pricks your heart this morning Mama is worthy of honor mama is worthy of respect and look at the life that your Godly Christian mama has lived and think about how oh what what's going to make Mama happy is for you to be with her in glory the picture ain't complete without you what what if this morning what if there's a Lo loose a loose spoke in the wheel what if there's a loose in the chain and that that that weak Link in the chain is you and mama ain't going to be happy with without you you're the part the missing piece well it's time it's time to fix that it's time to run to Christ what makes Mama happy as you that's the happiest time in Mama's life brother R said see her kitties all at home so don't be missing on that day when we sit down with our families and groups across the canopies of Eternity what a they what a day that will be then we'll understand now we're resting on this promise amen and he's the one that promised it in Revelation 1 verse 16 it says out of his mouth with a sharp two-edged sword that sword is not just something to read about but it's something with some power behind it something that's going to do something it's going to do what it says and his countenance was as the sun shinest in his strength now that's same one that that is being spoke of there in Revelations 1:8 says I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive forever more and have the keys of hell and of death we're talking about life this morning and in John 6:39 it says this is the Father's will which hath sent me that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day now there's a promise that we can trust in oh that same one that out of his mouth went his word like a sharp two-edged sword that same one that said I am he that liveth that same one said I ain't going to lose none not one of them everyone that I saw before the foundation of world I'm coming to get them if they're a weak Link in the chain right now if they're broken spoken the wheel I'm coming back to make sure that that Family Circle ain't unbroken oh thank God this morning that he promised that he would lose nothing that means this morning if you're lost if you're lost and undone he's coming for you he's coming after you this morning and maybe you hear that little resonation in your your heart that you know that God's pulling at you maybe oh God is the one that's drawing and when God calls there's only one thing for you to do is to respond to that gospel call it's our mother the word that's calling us it's that it's that God it's that El shedi that's got everything bottled up in him everything that you need if you need something from him this morning turn to him because brother R said there's only one way you can lose that's sit still and don't act on it there's only one way that you can lose it this morning is to not do nothing there's one thing God cannot do he can't fail that's one thing he can't do he cannot fail he has to win every time because he's God he said I'll lose nothing cause no man can pluck them out of my father's hand he said he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has eternal life and shall never come to the Judgment but pass from Death un life he said I'll lose nothing and will raise it up at the last day the musician can go ahead and come forward and we'll close that he said if you're part if you're part of the great family of God I believe this morning he's coming after you if you are that weak L little weak link that has separated this great family reunion at that day May the god of Heaven this morning somehow in a mysterious way unravel those little knots that's tied in your mind and reveal to you the love that he has for you may you come sweetly to ser serve him oh that's the god the kind of God that we have this morning a God who will love us like a mother will like he told I spoke through Isaiah a mother might forget but how could God forget you this morning I pray that these words will resonate in your heart to know that our mother our mothers are worthy of honor C through them came life let's rise to our feet and just worship the Lord you love him this morning amen we're missing a song leader we're missing something well brother R would say he'd say if there was a sinner who's present now he'd say oh god I've never not yet hook myself into that link I am the missing one that would not be there when mother goes to look at around Glory I'll not be there for I've never yet made my peace with God I have not the hope of eternal life in me but today I want that he said he was just asking people to pray for me I want to be remembered in prayer yeah I think that should be our desire this morning if we know there's something wrong in our heart I wonder this morning I'm not even going to ask to lift your hand or anything but if you know in your heart that there's a need won't you just reach up to him by faith let your faith just reach up to him and touch him say Lord God I I need something from you you know down in your heart if you're that weak link if there's something lacking in your life you know if there's something missing Lord Jesus we just thank you this morning for your grace for these words of encouragement thank you Lord for your promises Lord you're the one that promised that you'd never leave us or forsake us and you're the one that promised you'd not lose one oh what a Blessed Assurance this morning that there won't even be one loss that you knew before the foundation of the world Lord maybe there's just somebody this morning that hasn't quite responded to you hasn't quite given up hasn't quite sacrificed himself to you Lord I pray God that you'll never let them rest Lord Jesus until they respond to you until they respond to that gospel call Lord I pray God that you'll just give encouragement to the Believers here this morning Lord Jesus and to all the mothers Lord God to recognize Lord what a great purpose and what what a great place that God has given them to bring forth life and to and to mold these young young minds young young little children Lord Jesus and set them on the right path Lord to follow after you and I pray God that they'll be encouraged Lord Jesus encouraged more to be more steadfast and more zealous Lord to to just obey your word Lord God and set forth on the on the course of life that you have given to us Lord Lord we
