[0:01] god bless you this morning
[0:10] try to get this working again
[0:22] all right we're on uh we've been we've
[0:24] been studying on where paul was talking
[0:26] about rest
[0:28] after after going on through a through a
[0:30] journey through the wilderness the
[0:32] children of israel were trying to get to
[0:33] a place where they could rest
[0:35] so before we before we start studying
[0:37] this out let's just go to the lord in
[0:39] prayer well god we're so grateful to be
[0:40] able to gather together amongst your
[0:42] people and around your word and we just
[0:43] pray lord that you'll just bless today's
[0:45] services and bless our little study now
[0:47] we pray in the name of the lord jesus
[0:49] amen
[0:52] so in hebrews chapter 4 verse 1 it says
[0:55] let us therefore fear
[0:57] unless the promise being lest left us
[1:01] of entering into his rest
[1:03] any of you should seem to come short of
[1:05] it
[1:06] for unto us was the gospel preached
[1:09] as well as unto them but the word
[1:12] preached did not profit them not being
[1:14] mixed with faith in them that heard it
[1:17] for we which have believed to enter into
[1:19] rest
[1:20] as he said i have as i have sworn
[1:23] in my wrath
[1:25] if they shall enter into my rest
[1:28] although the works were finished from
[1:29] the foundation of the world
[1:31] or he spake in a certain place of the
[1:33] seventh day on this wise and god did
[1:36] rest the seventh day from all his works
[1:39] and in this place again if they shall
[1:41] enter into my rest
[1:44] now now
[1:45] like the last time we were talking about
[1:47] if you just just to kind of remind you
[1:49] as we study this out there's these
[1:51] patterns that are repeated throughout
[1:53] the scripture and there's this always
[1:54] this pattern of of of you start out on a
[1:57] journey and then there's a labor and you
[1:59] you can even see when god created the
[2:02] world in seven days he
[2:03] he worked he labored and then he said he
[2:07] stopped
[2:08] there was a place where god came to a
[2:10] place of rest now even in your christian
[2:12] journey you you you start you hear the
[2:14] gospel preached and you say you know
[2:16] there's i think there's something to it
[2:18] when you begin to to ask god to forgive
[2:20] you of your sins and you enter a
[2:22] justified state that the holy ghost is
[2:24] working something in your life and then
[2:25] you start working you start laboring i
[2:28] see that that pattern but see you're not
[2:30] in a rest yet you're not at rest and so
[2:33] now you think about what rest is now
[2:36] rest is
[2:37] um you know
[2:39] we're talking about the condition of
[2:40] your soul the state of your soul where
[2:42] your soul is at peace and you know maybe
[2:44] maybe examine ourselves this morning and
[2:46] think you know if um
[2:48] i i i was just laughing at something i
[2:50] read the other day where somebody i saw
[2:52] somebody said um uh a hundred percent of
[2:55] people 200 years old are all dead
[2:58] now
[2:59] now you think about you know
[3:02] if if if time were to go on and things
[3:04] you know eventually you're you're going
[3:06] to go down in the ground so you begin to
[3:08] meditate on things like that and you
[3:10] think it what's what's the state of my
[3:12] soul is it really at rest am i at rest
[3:16] or am i am am i a place of turmoil do i
[3:19] do i know that i'm where i'm going to go
[3:22] a lot of times i i love the story of
[3:25] charles
[3:28] not charles um i forget his name john
[3:30] wesley's parents when
[3:32] his dad when he was on his deathbed and
[3:34] he had all of his kids around him and he
[3:36] said
[3:37] i'm going to paraphrase but he said i
[3:39] take such comfort in knowing that one
[3:41] day i'm going to see my children again
[3:43] because they're all christians and i'm a
[3:46] christian so he had he was he had a rest
[3:48] in his soul that you know i'm a
[3:50] christian and one day you know even
[3:51] though we're parting that that i'm gonna
[3:54] see my children again and so you know
[3:56] you think about rest in your soul is
[3:58] something bad might be happening on the
[4:00] outside he was on his deathbed and he
[4:02] was and on the outside it looked pretty
[4:04] grim but rest on the inside is when you
[4:06] have confidence
[4:08] so what gives you that rest
[4:10] you know we talk about um
[4:12] this is almost like i i i remember you
[4:15] know
[4:16] so many little
[4:17] little lessons from my parents growing
[4:19] up about rest and that those kind of
[4:21] things and you know that that uh you
[4:24] talked with i talked to when my kids
[4:26] growing up but
[4:27] you know i really want to hone down what
[4:29] rest is because
[4:31] you know you can get in your mind that
[4:33] if you go to a camp meeting or something
[4:34] and you feel something special happen in
[4:37] the supernatural movement of the spirit
[4:39] you know that
[4:40] you know that that's rest but then you
[4:42] go home and you're you're not in rest
[4:44] you're not you're not you might not be
[4:46] you know
[4:47] your soul not might not be have come to
[4:49] that place of rest so rest goes beyond
[4:52] and just like feeling something or maybe
[4:54] or you know seeing something
[4:56] supernatural or just saying some good
[4:58] words but rest has got to be
[5:01] it's it's it is a supernatural thing
[5:03] that comes from god it's it's and we
[5:05] know what it is it's the it's it's what
[5:07] the holy ghost does in your life
[5:09] but what is rest
[5:12] so now let's back up for a second and
[5:14] just kind of look at that pattern again
[5:16] that we were talking about that that
[5:17] first first there's labor and then
[5:19] there's rest first first there's labor
[5:21] now think about going through the the
[5:23] outer core inner court holy foleys that
[5:25] in that in that holy place there's a lot
[5:27] of labor going on you're trying to light
[5:29] the candlesticks as brother brown will
[5:31] explain you're trying to keep them lit
[5:32] they go out let's get smokey and
[5:34] everything and you're going over that
[5:35] table of showbread and and you're
[5:37] studying out the word and probing and
[5:39] you're working and then you go over to
[5:41] the altar of incense and you're praying
[5:42] and you're god forgive me and everything
[5:44] and you're you're going through all
[5:46] these motions of being a christian and
[5:48] and and trying to trying to figure
[5:50] things out
[5:51] what does it mean to be a christian what
[5:53] does this scripture mean as do these
[5:55] people know what they're talking about
[5:57] is the message true and all these kind
[5:58] of things but then when you go into the
[6:00] holy place you cease from your labor and
[6:03] you're at rest now even god and when he
[6:06] created the worlds on the seventh day it
[6:07] got we talked about that earlier that he
[6:09] ended his work which he had made and he
[6:11] rested on the seventh day from all his
[6:13] work which he had made
[6:15] and god blessed the seventh day and
[6:17] sanctified it because that in it he had
[6:20] arrested from all his work which god
[6:22] created and made
[6:24] and in the old testament you know the
[6:26] fourth commandment was that you hallow
[6:28] that that that that sabbath day and you
[6:30] keep that day
[6:32] but jesus when he began to preach he
[6:34] said come unto me all you that labor and
[6:36] i'll give you rest
[6:38] so he's taking it up to a uh he's
[6:41] showing us the true meaning of that rest
[6:42] that god wanted us to have
[6:44] but even that in that when jesus said
[6:46] those words coming to me all year that
[6:48] labor
[6:49] he's talking to people that are laboring
[6:51] because you got to have the labor first
[6:54] the labor comes first
[6:56] in a sanctified condition where you're
[6:58] trying to work things out and figure it
[7:00] out what's right and probe and study and
[7:03] then comes the rest
[7:07] and there in exodus chapter 20 remember
[7:09] the sabbath day to keep it holy six days
[7:11] to shout thou labor
[7:13] you're going to be laboring first
[7:16] and do all thy work but the seventh day
[7:20] is the sabbath of the lord thy god
[7:22] and it thou shalt not do any work
[7:25] thou nor thy son not our thy daughter
[7:27] thy manservant nor thy maidservant nor
[7:29] thy cattle nor thy stranger that is
[7:31] within thy gates now you see how this
[7:33] pattern you can you can understand
[7:35] things by looking at the pattern that's
[7:36] laid out
[7:37] first you start on your journey and then
[7:39] you labor and you're doing a lot of work
[7:42] work out your salvation with fear and
[7:44] trembling
[7:45] and you're working but then you come
[7:46] into rest
[7:49] which is what paul says
[7:55] yeah that's that's not exodus that's uh
[7:58] that's the scripture we've been reading
[7:59] here in hebrews it should be a hebrews 4
[8:02] 11 that's a typo
[8:03] let us labor therefore to enter into
[8:05] that rest
[8:07] labor therefore to enter into that rest
[8:09] lest any man fall after the same example
[8:12] of unbelief
[8:14] now what are what did brother brown say
[8:16] rest was now rest is to have everlasting
[8:19] rest
[8:20] to have everlasting rest
[8:22] rest from all your troubles and all your
[8:24] work now that doesn't mean you're not
[8:25] going to have troubles and worries
[8:27] that but that means when you have a
[8:29] trouble or worry
[8:31] that there's some kind of confidence
[8:33] there
[8:34] that there's a plan that's being worked
[8:36] out
[8:37] that you can rely on god that his
[8:39] promises are true
[8:40] that even if something if the doctor
[8:42] tells you something bad you're still
[8:44] resting even though maybe on the outside
[8:47] things are rough
[8:48] but on the inside you're resting and
[8:51] we're talking about the condition of the
[8:52] soul no more task masters that means
[8:55] that means that there's not the devil
[8:57] isn't like running you rough shot and
[9:00] and taking control of your mind and of
[9:02] your thoughts and things and and and and
[9:04] making you bow down to his every whim of
[9:07] smoking cigarettes and and uh you know
[9:10] alcohol and doing things you're at rest
[9:13] because god has taken over
[9:16] god has taken over your innermost being
[9:19] no more restless nights
[9:21] like like jesus there in that boat when
[9:23] all the
[9:24] he was sleeping because he was at rest
[9:26] when everything else was in turmoil
[9:28] around him and that boat was being
[9:29] tossed to and fro but he was at rest and
[9:32] the brother of them said they were on
[9:33] their way to the promised land of rest
[9:37] it flowed with milk and honey
[9:40] the grapes was so big that two men
[9:43] packed one bunch over their shoulders in
[9:46] other words everything they had need of
[9:48] would be provided everything they needed
[9:50] was in that promised land
[9:52] now of course a lot of times we think
[9:54] that we need a big old giant car and all
[9:56] kinds of things that we don't really
[9:57] need but everything you need is going to
[9:59] be provided for and everything we need
[10:01] is provided in in god's word
[10:06] our brother brown said in hebrews
[10:07] chapter four in that sermon he said now
[10:09] the thought is
[10:11] if we are on our way to the rest
[10:14] what is the rest
[10:16] where is it
[10:17] is it joining church now if you join
[10:19] church and you're just coming to church
[10:20] that you might just be laboring you
[10:22] might still be laboring and trying to
[10:24] work things out and and we're in a work
[10:26] work that work mode
[10:29] is it being baptized a certain way
[10:32] is it becoming a member of the greatest
[10:33] church in the city wearing better
[10:35] clothes
[10:36] do any of those things give us rest
[10:39] i mean i'm talking about the confidence
[10:41] where you know if you're going to die
[10:42] today on the way home
[10:44] that you know where you're going to go
[10:47] is it education
[10:49] is it money so we can quit work and just
[10:51] lay down rest the rest of our life as we
[10:54] call it
[10:55] no that's not it
[10:57] now when jesus began to speak about this
[11:00] sabbath the pharisees and the sadducees
[11:02] who were keeping the law they they began
[11:04] to get confused at the way he would
[11:06] explain this
[11:07] because he he was he was trying to point
[11:09] out to them that you think you know i
[11:11] know what your your your purpose is is
[11:14] supposed to be and and you think you
[11:17] understand but i'm gonna change things a
[11:19] little bit for you
[11:20] and he said in mark chapter two he said
[11:22] and it came to pass that he went through
[11:23] the cornfields on the sabbath day and
[11:25] his disciples began he look at him he's
[11:27] going on the sabbath day which was
[11:28] supposed to be set apart for them to not
[11:30] do any work
[11:31] and he's plucking he's he's
[11:33] he's doing work
[11:35] to pluck the ears of corn and the
[11:36] pharisees said unto him behold why do
[11:38] they on the sabbath day
[11:40] that which is not lawful
[11:42] and he said unto them
[11:44] have you never read what david did when
[11:46] he had need and wasn't hungry he and
[11:48] they that were with him and i'm just
[11:49] going to skip skip over that but you
[11:51] know david when he had when he was
[11:52] hungry he went and did what was supposed
[11:54] to be he ate from the table of shoe
[11:56] bread which was supposed to be set apart
[11:57] from the priest
[11:59] and so so
[12:00] jesus is trying to tell you that
[12:03] he's trying to prove to them that they
[12:04] didn't understand what the sabbath was
[12:07] and he's trying to prove to them that
[12:08] the sabbath is supposed to be to help
[12:11] people not not to burden you but to help
[12:14] and isn't that what the holy ghost is
[12:15] supposed to do to not burden you down
[12:17] with with a lot of
[12:18] things that you have to keep necessarily
[12:20] but it's supposed to be a help to you to
[12:23] deliver you from your task masters to
[12:25] deliver you from your place of of
[12:27] turmoil to deliver you from a
[12:30] from your righteousness to help you and
[12:32] he said unto them the sabbath was made
[12:34] for man and not man for the sabbath
[12:36] therefore the son of man is lord also of
[12:39] the sabbath
[12:41] and again in mark chapter 3 he entered
[12:43] again into the synagogue and there was a
[12:45] man there which had a withered hand and
[12:46] you think about how skewed their
[12:48] perception of the sabbath was
[12:50] they watched him whether he would heal
[12:52] him on the sabbath day that they might
[12:53] accuse him and he saith unto the man
[12:55] which had the withered hand
[12:56] stand forth and he saith unto them is it
[12:59] lawful to do good on the sabbath day or
[13:01] to do evil to save life or to kill
[13:04] but they held their peace
[13:06] and my how skewed their understanding
[13:08] had to be to to think that it would be
[13:10] better to keep that to keep what they
[13:12] thought was a good regulation that to
[13:14] save somebody's life
[13:16] they thought it would be better to just
[13:18] let somebody you know
[13:21] stay in there in their condition
[13:23] and he said he looked around about on
[13:25] them with anger
[13:26] being grieved for the hardness of their
[13:29] heart so there's the people that had no
[13:31] understanding of what the sabbath really
[13:33] is he saith unto the man stressed forth
[13:35] on hand and he stretched it out and his
[13:37] hand was restored whole
[13:38] as the other
[13:40] so in colossians
[13:43] it colossians paul says let no man
[13:45] therefore judge you and meet
[13:47] or in drink or in respect of an holy day
[13:50] or of the new moon or of the sabbath
[13:53] days
[13:54] which are shadow of things to come
[13:56] but the body is of christ
[13:59] now let's let's sit on that just for a
[14:01] second and think about that
[14:03] because he's saying that you understand
[14:06] he's saying that the pharisees and the
[14:08] sadducees and the jews of that day they
[14:09] had another state they thought they had
[14:11] an understanding of what the sabbath was
[14:13] and all these these things that were
[14:15] typing something in the old testament
[14:18] that would be fulfilled in the new
[14:20] so these things he said they're a shadow
[14:22] of things to come
[14:24] but the body is of christ what does that
[14:26] mean now if you hold your hand up
[14:29] in front of a light source you can see
[14:30] the shadow of that thing and that's why
[14:33] he's saying the body
[14:35] is of christ with the body is the thing
[14:38] that is being shattered
[14:39] so if you have if you held your hand up
[14:41] in front of a light you can see the
[14:43] shadow and we'll say that's the old
[14:45] testament sabbath day
[14:47] but the body
[14:49] is of christ and the body is the thing
[14:51] the body is that that holy ghost sabbath
[14:54] that the thing that is being typed of in
[14:56] the old testament the body is the holy
[14:58] ghost that that's that that god will
[15:01] give us in the in the in the new
[15:03] testament the body is of christ so we
[15:05] look at these the old testament type and
[15:07] we we
[15:09] by the new testament we begin to have an
[15:11] understanding of what was being typed in
[15:13] the old testament
[15:14] what is the what is the sabbath in the
[15:16] new testament and in the message shalom
[15:18] brother brown said the holy ghost
[15:20] is our sabbath
[15:22] the bible said so come unto me and all
[15:25] ye that labor and heavy laden i'll give
[15:27] you sabbath
[15:29] to your soul
[15:31] not a day paul said you you that keep a
[15:33] day i'm afraid of you but there
[15:35] remaineth the rest in hebrews 4 to the
[15:37] people of god
[15:39] a sabbath keeping
[15:42] now in in and let's let's think about
[15:44] what the effect of the holy ghost is
[15:47] and then we'll understand what a real
[15:48] sabbath is
[15:50] the effect of the holy ghost is in john
[15:52] chapter 16 jesus said i have yet many
[15:55] things to say unto you but you cannot
[15:56] bear them now
[15:57] howbeit when he the spirit of truth has
[15:59] come he'll guide you into all truth
[16:02] for he shall not speak of himself but
[16:04] whatever he shall hear that shall he
[16:05] speak and he'll show you things to come
[16:07] in other words you come to church
[16:09] and you you bring the holy ghost in you
[16:11] the word and then he will speak back to
[16:14] you what the true meaning of that word
[16:16] is
[16:18] so that the holy ghost is revealing to
[16:20] you the word
[16:24] and in hebrews chapter 4 in 1957 he said
[16:27] i want you to remember that unless we
[16:29] find out unless god has revealed it to
[16:32] us no matter how much we go to church
[16:34] that has nothing to do with it
[16:36] god must come by revelation
[16:39] and reveal himself to us
[16:41] so we're looking for revelation now now
[16:44] you see how see how look look at that
[16:46] journey of a believer
[16:47] you you start hearing about the gospel
[16:50] and you want more of it and you begin to
[16:52] labor
[16:53] but it's not quite it's not quite seal
[16:56] in you
[16:57] but when you come to a rest
[16:59] you know
[17:00] you know what god has done for you
[17:03] and just in jezebel religion he said
[17:06] and and i just want to
[17:08] kind of bring this out when when brother
[17:10] brown went beyond the curtain of time
[17:11] one of the things that the people beyond
[17:13] the curtain of time told him was he he
[17:15] began to ask him well well will paul
[17:17] have to be the judge for the gospel i
[17:19] preached
[17:20] that he preached and he said yes and he
[17:22] said i preached every word just exactly
[17:24] the way he did
[17:26] and the millions screamed out
[17:28] we're resting on that now what were they
[17:30] resting on they were resting on the word
[17:32] that had been preached
[17:34] they were resting on the word that that
[17:36] that uh
[17:37] that brother branham had preached they
[17:40] were resting on the fact that it was the
[17:41] same thing that paul had preached
[17:44] and they were resting on that gospel was
[17:47] going to bring them out of the grave
[17:49] they were resting on that so that's the
[17:51] kind of rest that i'm talking about the
[17:53] rest that gives you confidence and you
[17:56] think about those beyond the curtain of
[17:57] time or resting they they had such
[17:59] confidence
[18:00] that they were resting on that
[18:03] you think about here's another example
[18:05] too in genesis chapter 28 where jacob
[18:07] when he when his when his parents began
[18:09] to worry about who he was going to get
[18:10] married to and and uh
[18:13] they sent him off to go to go find a
[18:14] wife and he he he's knelt he he stopped
[18:18] off
[18:19] made a little stop and placed next to
[18:21] next to a river or or wherever and he
[18:23] said and it says he took a stone
[18:26] and he laid his head down on that stone
[18:28] for a pillow and while he was asleep he
[18:30] began to have that that the dream of the
[18:32] of the
[18:33] the ladder with the angels going up and
[18:35] down the top was crying what course what
[18:36] that what was that ladder but you see
[18:39] how that perfectly types he put his head
[18:41] as rest
[18:43] on a stone
[18:44] which types your revelation
[18:46] just like faith
[18:48] is where your resting place is
[18:51] at the bottom of the ladder
[18:53] and when you're resting
[18:55] you you have confidence
[18:57] and he took that stone that he put for
[18:59] his pillows the next morning and set it
[19:00] up for a pillar and pulled oil upon the
[19:02] top of it it was an he anointed that
[19:05] stone
[19:06] and he called the name of that place
[19:07] bethel but the name of that city was
[19:09] called luz at the first and you think
[19:10] about
[19:11] it what a strange thing
[19:14] to rest your head on a rock
[19:17] that doesn't sound very restful
[19:20] but yet we rest we get our rest on the
[19:23] rock of revelation the revelation of
[19:26] jesus christ
[19:28] now see how you can have feelings and
[19:30] sensations and everything but that
[19:32] doesn't necessarily give you rest but
[19:34] when god's word is revealed to you then
[19:36] you can have confidence you can have
[19:38] confidence in what your position is and
[19:40] where you are
[19:42] now let's think about what happened on
[19:43] the day of pentecost we're talking about
[19:46] rest
[19:47] now all that time that uh before before
[19:49] the day of pentecost they they were
[19:52] probing at who whether jesus really was
[19:55] who he said he was and they were
[19:56] concerned after he died on the cross
[19:58] what you know they're wondering if he
[20:00] really did arise again and
[20:01] and there was all that they you know
[20:03] they're working they're laboring they're
[20:05] trying to work things out they're when
[20:06] he said it was hard to be understood
[20:08] things they didn't understand he'd say
[20:10] you know in matthew 28 19 be baptized
[20:12] the name of the father son and holy
[20:14] ghost that don't make any sense it
[20:15] doesn't seem like you got to eat my
[20:17] flesh and drink my blood that doesn't
[20:18] make any sense but yet they hung on and
[20:21] they're they're laboring and working out
[20:23] work trying to work it out in their mind
[20:25] but on the day of pentecost
[20:27] everything changed
[20:29] because now they're resting they know
[20:32] what they believe and he said and in
[20:35] acts chapter 2 or verse 15 i'm just
[20:37] going to skip through some of these
[20:38] scriptures
[20:39] he said for these paul began peter began
[20:42] to explain what was going on because he
[20:44] identified what was happening with the
[20:46] word and he said for these are not
[20:48] drunken
[20:49] as ye suppose
[20:51] these aren't drunken i'm gonna tell you
[20:52] what's going on it's the holy ghost
[20:55] seeing it is by the third hour of the
[20:56] day
[20:58] and he began to identify he said this is
[21:00] that
[21:01] that was spoken of by the prophet joel
[21:03] this is this is that
[21:06] and he said this jesus hath god raised
[21:08] up
[21:09] you see how he's he's now resting it's
[21:12] it's not something that he's probing at
[21:13] anymore he knows what has happened
[21:17] jesus is alive and that same jesus that
[21:20] rose from the grave
[21:22] that same holy ghost is now working in
[21:24] the bride he said this jesus hath god
[21:27] raised up where we are all witnesses
[21:30] and he begins to quote the things that
[21:32] david talked about that david has not
[21:34] for david has not ascended into the
[21:35] heavens but he saith unto him the lord
[21:36] said unto my lord sit thou on my right
[21:38] hand until i make thy foes thy footstool
[21:41] in other words he's identifying with
[21:42] scripture that i know where god is now
[21:46] that he sat down in the throne of my
[21:48] heart
[21:50] and he said therefore
[21:52] let all the house of israel know
[21:53] assuredly
[21:55] you see how when rest comes from knowing
[21:58] assuredly from knowing because the holy
[22:01] ghost has revealed to you the person of
[22:04] jesus christ
[22:05] therefore let all the house of israel
[22:07] know assuredly that god hath made amen
[22:11] that same jesus yes let me get crucified
[22:14] both lord and christ
[22:16] so brother brahman said in awakening
[22:18] jesus
[22:19] he said you say you're a christian he's
[22:21] talking to somebody i think in a prayer
[22:23] line he said i believe you are you
[22:24] believe
[22:25] what are you resting in
[22:27] what are you resting in
[22:30] some day he'll raise our bodies up after
[22:32] they've absolutely completely perished
[22:33] if you don't believe that why you go to
[22:35] church if there's no resurrection aren't
[22:37] we amongst men most miserable
[22:39] what are you resting in though
[22:41] his word of promise
[22:43] he that believeth in me though he were
[22:45] dead yet shall he live
[22:47] i am the resurrection and life
[22:49] we're resting in what god said
[22:52] and not just the words on the page but
[22:54] we're resting in a revelation of those
[22:56] words
[23:00] brother brown said and we would see
[23:01] jesus he said our soul rests solemnly
[23:03] upon his word
[23:05] and faith cannot be based anywhere else
[23:08] all theology and man-made isms are
[23:10] sinking sands and faith cannot find its
[23:13] resting place upon the shifting sands of
[23:16] man's theology
[23:18] it's got to find a solemn resting place
[23:20] on the immovable rock of almighty god's
[23:23] word
[23:24] there's where it anchors god said so
[23:28] that settles it
[23:29] that's forever the truth
[23:33] he said i'm resting on his his ability
[23:36] that's my hope and stay i'm resting upon
[23:38] his ability i'm resting upon his grace
[23:40] not upon what i am what he is i'm
[23:42] resting on his promise
[23:44] because he made the promise
[23:47] and he swore to the promise
[23:50] and i know that we have eternal life
[23:53] you see how sure
[23:55] resting is
[23:56] when you know that you know
[24:02] and we're going to stop on this
[24:04] and jesus promised that it would be
[24:07] another rest that was typed in the old
[24:09] testament that's why he said come unto
[24:11] me all ye that labor
[24:13] that work
[24:14] you're working you're trying to work it
[24:16] out
[24:17] come to me all year that labor and are
[24:18] heavy laden
[24:20] and i will give you rest
[24:22] the musicians should go ahead and come
[24:24] god bless you
[24:26] [Applause]
[24:53] you
