[29:59] come on the scene Among Us and manifest
[30:01] yourself cuz you promised that anywhere
[30:03] two or three would be gathered in your
[30:05] name that you would be there so we're
[30:07] dependent upon that we believe we've
[30:09] gathered for that one purpose not to be
[30:11] seen or just to have a place to go but
[30:14] to be to the word that we could hear
[30:16] from you and we are asking that you
[30:18] bless each one bless those that are here
[30:20] and those that are not able to be here
[30:22] and just let your love be with each and
[30:24] every one forgive our sins cuz we want
[30:26] to be covered by the blood lead us now
[30:29] as we speak about you in Jesus name
[30:34] amen
[30:35] Ephesians one that we're going to read
[30:37] them down to about the 11th
[30:40] verse tonight but we'll start the third
[30:42] verse through to the 11th
[30:46] verse blessed be the God and father of
[30:48] our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us
[30:50] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[30:52] places in Christ according as he has
[30:55] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[30:58] of the world that we should be holy and
[31:00] Without Blame before him in love having
[31:03] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[31:05] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[31:08] according to the good pleasure of his
[31:09] will to the praise of the glory of his
[31:12] grace wherein Heath made us accepted in
[31:14] the Beloved in whom we have Redemption
[31:17] through his blood the Forgiveness of
[31:18] sins according to the riches of his
[31:21] grace wherein Heath abounded toward us
[31:24] in all wisdom and Prudence prudence
[31:28] having made known unto us the mystery of
[31:30] his will according to his good pleasure
[31:33] which he had purposed in himself that in
[31:35] the dispensation of the fullness of
[31:37] times he might gather together in one
[31:40] all things in Christ both which are in
[31:43] heaven and which are on earth even in
[31:46] him in whom also we have obtained an
[31:49] inheritance being predestinated
[31:51] according to the purpose of him who
[31:53] worketh all things after the counsel of
[31:56] his own own will you may be seated the
[31:59] Lord at his Blessing to the reading of
[32:02] the
[32:03] word
[32:05] and I read on down to
[32:08] the 10th verse because we'll get to that
[32:12] after a
[32:13] while you know I've heard people in the
[32:15] message say that especially one man said
[32:19] that he didn't believe in dispensations
[32:22] well you know the prophet said you'd be
[32:24] messed up in the Bible if you didn't
[32:25] believe in dispensations now you you
[32:28] would really get confused and we'll read
[32:30] one after a while and and you know but
[32:32] that says th are the dispensation of the
[32:34] fullness of times and you know the
[32:37] prophet said that there was a
[32:39] dispensation of the law there was a
[32:41] dispensation of this there was a
[32:42] dispensation of
[32:44] that and he said and there's a
[32:46] dispensation of
[32:48] adoption all right so then that's the
[32:50] time that we're living in is this hour
[32:53] so we'll get to that the Lord willing on
[32:55] as we go along now what do we've been
[32:57] talking about it said we've been talking
[32:59] about
[33:00] adoption adoption is to to adopt
[33:07] someone into your
[33:10] family and you know bringing them into
[33:14] uh your line or inheritance or lineage
[33:17] or whatever you want to call it and you
[33:20] know in doing that see
[33:24] then that's our natural words of
[33:26] adoption
[33:27] but in the Bible terminologies the
[33:29] children of Israel the the right of
[33:31] adoption was in the bases that the child
[33:35] was born a son of into the family you
[33:38] know a child and then they came to a
[33:41] place of the tutoring or training to
[33:44] where that they could be adopted into
[33:47] the family and we're bringing that and
[33:49] trying to to look at it you know from
[33:51] the scriptural point but trying to make
[33:54] it just as simple as we can and and talk
[33:56] about about it is as much as we can get
[33:59] into you know and and not try to run off
[34:03] everybody wants to talk about this and
[34:04] that on adoption but to me I believe we
[34:06] need to just you know kind of slow down
[34:09] and and think about the things that
[34:12] we're talking
[34:13] about because see you and I were
[34:15] alienated as we covered in the last
[34:18] message we were we were away from God we
[34:21] had no hes we were Gentiles we had no
[34:24] lineage rights we had nothing the the uh
[34:28] adoption really the scriptures says that
[34:30] it was pertaining to Israel you know
[34:34] because they had the right of sunship
[34:36] that's right but when they turned down
[34:38] that right of sunship and we as Gentiles
[34:41] accepted the right see then that would
[34:44] make us the children of God all right
[34:47] now as one firm believer I believe that
[34:50] we must be born again Amen to be a child
[34:54] of God I don't believe I told you last
[34:57] Wednesday everybody in the world is a
[34:59] child of God by natural creation that's
[35:02] right it don't matter who it is Adolf
[35:04] Hitler who the good or the bad it
[35:07] doesn't matter every person is a child
[35:10] of God by natural creation all right but
[35:14] that was not what Nicodemus was talking
[35:17] to Jesus about when he had heard him
[35:19] speak about the kingdom and and all and
[35:22] and all and that was not what he was
[35:24] doing so Jesus said you must be born
[35:27] again in other words that's like I've
[35:30] told you that there's a lot more was
[35:32] said than what's written in the Bible
[35:34] but there was probably hours of
[35:36] discussion upon the fact and not just a
[35:38] five minute uh conversation and
[35:41] Nicodemus gets up and walks out you know
[35:43] and there was probably a whole evening
[35:45] there that they had discussed things and
[35:47] and you know and in the point Nicodemus
[35:51] he said but it wouldn't do me any good
[35:54] because I've understood what you're
[35:55] saying you're saying that I was born
[35:58] wrong so if I was went back to my mother
[36:00] again and come out you would say I'd be
[36:02] born wrong again and and that would be
[36:05] true see that wouldn't wouldn't make any
[36:07] difference but Jesus was talking about
[36:09] another
[36:10] kingdom he was talking about the baptism
[36:13] of the Holy Ghost that he had to come
[36:15] and make way far to where that it could
[36:17] come to give his own life you know to
[36:19] bring us into it and we must receive the
[36:22] new birth to become the children of God
[36:24] right I know the purle of the message
[36:26] they of all of those quotes you know oh
[36:28] I always was an eternal I always was a
[36:32] child of God well I agree with what the
[36:35] prophet said but I don't agree with the
[36:37] slant are ways that people use those
[36:40] things for their own benefit because it
[36:43] it can't be contrary to what he would
[36:45] say in another place that's right amen
[36:47] see one can't fight the other one so
[36:50] then we need to to settle down and just
[36:52] think about the fact that we were lost
[36:56] amen doomed and on our way to hell
[36:58] that's right and deserved every bit of
[37:01] it but see Jesus Christ made a way to
[37:04] bring us into the family right all right
[37:08] on the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost
[37:09] came put them into the kingdom made them
[37:12] in the family of God made the people
[37:15] that are the children of God all right a
[37:17] different type of child not just a child
[37:20] by natural creation as everybody is but
[37:24] this is a a child of God that kind of
[37:27] child that God wanted right all right
[37:29] then we we you know we came down and we
[37:32] lost those rights of of in the the
[37:35] tutorship and the things like that it
[37:37] turned out until it wound up being uh
[37:40] you know to where you can just barely
[37:41] get into the body of Christ and then God
[37:44] had to restore the word and the things
[37:46] and I want you to watch that if I have
[37:48] time to get to it if I don't I will
[37:50] Sunday will you know I just want to be
[37:52] slow that's what I'm trying to make it
[37:54] is real slow and and and anchor it to
[37:59] where you know that you'll know what I
[38:01] believe and the people listening know
[38:03] then what I believe I believe you must
[38:06] be born again before you can have
[38:09] eternal life oh but I believe I always
[38:14] was eternal well read on what the
[38:16] prophet
[38:17] said he said if you have eternal life
[38:20] right amen if you have eternal life the
[38:23] eternal life you have always was eternal
[38:26] all right but yet we're here in a lost
[38:30] condition searching for God trying to
[38:33] find a way and then everybody comes
[38:35] along with telling us we just really
[38:36] didn't need God anyway all we need to do
[38:38] is just wait we die we all go to
[38:40] heaven well wouldn't that be the way it
[38:42] would be if you if you had eternal life
[38:45] you just either wait until something
[38:47] happened at the Big Bang Theory would be
[38:48] banged again in reverse and we go back
[38:51] into eternity and you know but see
[38:54] people don't realize what their
[38:55] doctrines the way that they talk and
[38:58] things of what their doctrines show uh
[39:01] you know how much of the stupidity that
[39:04] we are as human Mortals to try to make
[39:07] our own way but I believe you must be
[39:09] born again and then we were covering
[39:12] that the prophet said God gave you a
[39:15] tutor according to Galatians 4 you know
[39:18] right that the child differ nothing from
[39:21] a servant though he be Lord of all amen
[39:24] though he be an only child say and he's
[39:27] you know an only son and and his total
[39:30] inheritance is when his father passes
[39:33] away he would be air of all things y
[39:36] amen and see he is right there because
[39:38] he's a child of God that's right you
[39:40] know he's a child of the
[39:42] person but yet being
[39:45] that he's he's under tutors and
[39:47] governors until the time
[39:49] appointed all right God knows how to
[39:52] raise children I like brother brother
[39:53] giri years ago he always liked the way
[39:56] sister sister or was you know sister or
[39:58] they had them three boys and and she'd
[40:01] bring this big old long Hickory with you
[40:04] know one them boys act up she just wow
[40:06] she never even lost to beat listening
[40:08] way it look most of the time she just
[40:10] reached over wrapped them and it took
[40:12] care of it you know but God really is
[40:15] the one that knows how to raise children
[40:17] right amen and that's one thing I want
[40:19] you to get out of this I tried to get it
[40:21] in last service and I want to get it
[40:24] into this service I I want to instill
[40:27] into your mind not a a I want this point
[40:31] in your
[40:32] mind we a lot of times look at things
[40:35] and think that there's nothing going on
[40:39] and if we had what we think we have we
[40:41] would to see all of these other things
[40:44] then they'll turn around and say well
[40:45] look at what they've done in the book of
[40:48] Acts well I
[40:51] agree I would have loved to been back
[40:53] there wouldn't
[40:54] you but you know br them from the book
[40:57] of Acts over here and let them stay over
[40:58] here about 3 months they probably want
[41:00] to go back to the book of
[41:02] Acts that's just carnal as I can make
[41:04] the point but the point of it is they
[41:07] were not facing the Devils you and I are
[41:10] having to face every day the prophet
[41:12] said the spirit just he said the spirit
[41:15] that gave their lives back down to the
[41:17] ages he said is in you and I you just be
[41:20] able to overcome
[41:24] right that's right just to be able would
[41:26] overcome right here that's right amen
[41:30] they didn't face what we're facing
[41:31] that's not excuses that's what everybody
[41:34] says about me they say oh you just make
[41:36] excuses you you explain it like a
[41:38] Baptist you know you just explain it
[41:40] away or where you know no it's a fact
[41:43] right ain't an excuse what's your excuse
[41:47] I know people don't like for me to be
[41:49] that harsh but see that's when you throw
[41:50] it out there and be able to take it back
[41:52] and swallow at least what's your excuse
[41:55] right right
[41:58] I know that gets hard and I'm hard
[42:00] myself on it because I don't I don't
[42:03] like for people to to say that God's not
[42:05] doing anything
[42:07] right for us to just live daily in the
[42:11] new birth and and living in the hour
[42:13] We're living is it's harder than the
[42:15] basic the prophet said it be easy to be
[42:17] able to give you life for the gospel
[42:19] right that's right that's right that's
[42:22] it'd be easy to just walk up and say I'm
[42:24] a Christian yep go ahead and kill
[42:27] me but you see then when you start
[42:29] trying to explain them I think you're
[42:31] trying to explain something away there's
[42:32] nobody in this building nobody in this
[42:34] world believes in manifestation any
[42:35] greater than the man you're looking at
[42:37] cuz I've seen God I've seen him manifest
[42:40] himself I've seen the dead raised I've
[42:42] seen the sick heal I've seen storms go
[42:44] away at a at a at a word I've Seen Rain
[42:48] come because of a word I've seen those
[42:50] things and you're witnesses to it right
[42:54] and I'm Witnesses into a lot of of your
[42:56] lives and what you've seen and done and
[42:58] the things that God has done through you
[42:59] it ain't been us anyway see but the
[43:03] thing of it is see God gave us the tutor
[43:06] right
[43:08] amen all right now get to Point the
[43:12] tutors of baptism of the Holy Ghost
[43:14] right that's right right well now listen
[43:18] if you don't believe in dispensations or
[43:20] or stages of something see then you get
[43:23] all messed up because I thought I was
[43:26] listening we was last night I believe
[43:28] night before last to brother Rand on an
[43:30] adoption
[43:31] and and he was talking about he said the
[43:34] no the church agent he said there's no
[43:38] difference that the father and the holy
[43:40] spirit's got to be the same amen he said
[43:44] else Jesus had two daddies that's right
[43:46] all right that's right now so then the
[43:48] tutor you're
[43:50] given is the holy spirit right but
[43:53] that's the father right that comes in
[43:56] you that's right that's not a second
[43:59] person or a third person that comes in
[44:01] you look at what the prophet said said
[44:04] he could search Heaven trying to find
[44:07] the greatest and he said to find the
[44:09] greatest of all the Holy Spirit why see
[44:12] we look at adoption like I said we look
[44:14] at it like the the father's going off
[44:17] the scene that's what I've always heard
[44:19] and it seem what I you know seemingly
[44:21] listen to people that adoption means the
[44:23] father's going off the scene boy look at
[44:25] the son man look look at well look at
[44:28] we're What It Is Well I don't look at it
[44:31] that way that's what I'm trying to get
[44:33] you to see if the holy spirit is the
[44:37] Holy Spirit and that is the father in
[44:40] the form of the Holy Spirit to do the
[44:43] tutoring and raising then the father's
[44:45] inside of you
[44:48] amen
[44:49] amen the very one that the holy spirit
[44:52] is going to report back
[44:54] to right that we look at and try to make
[44:58] trinitarianism out of it the holy
[45:01] spirit's down here and he's trying to
[45:03] cover up and over here's the father and
[45:05] he's going and taking him to report
[45:07] that's just an example that's
[45:10] right y the holy spirit is the Father
[45:14] the father living inside of you right
[45:16] making you a son right cuz it's the only
[45:19] way you can be son right those little
[45:22] things is what I'm trying to
[45:24] cover
[45:27] we preached on adoption we've been
[45:29] through a lot of it but trying to
[45:31] discover some small little minut things
[45:35] that you can't have the Holy Spirit as
[45:38] one person and the father another person
[45:42] right so look what he's doing the father
[45:45] is coming on the scene in the son wasn't
[45:48] that what Jesus was right was not Jesus
[45:52] almighty God manifested in human flesh
[45:56] amen is that true well then if he was
[45:59] almighty God in human flesh what does he
[46:01] expect his children to be right
[46:03] right it wasn't Jesus one person and God
[46:06] another
[46:07] person that's right that won't work out
[46:11] you're going back to your trinitarianism
[46:13] right
[46:14] oh Jesus was God made manifest right he
[46:19] said un let you believe that I am he you
[46:21] will die in your sins that's right
[46:24] that's right
[46:27] y he was was making a statement out
[46:29] there a while ago talking about
[46:30] something I won't say no more than this
[46:32] part of it that that it was you know
[46:35] brother dick and I was about it and a
[46:37] brother said that Jesus didn't heal
[46:40] nobody well I know he's trying to make
[46:43] the
[46:44] body but you better get your scriptures
[46:46] right folks that's right amen amen
[46:49] that's right
[46:51] Amen to forgive sins is to heal all
[46:55] right that's amen
[46:57] right absolutely amen the Bible said the
[47:01] son of
[47:02] man had power on earth right to forgive
[47:06] sins amen now the son of man was the
[47:09] Lord Jesus Christ that's right all right
[47:13] see it sounds
[47:16] beautiful but where is the foundation
[47:19] where's the the basis to hold it on see
[47:21] adoption is
[47:23] not that the father just backs out of
[47:25] and he's off the scene and he's
[47:27] gone no he come on the scene in that new
[47:32] birth that you receive that's God in the
[47:35] form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[47:37] why would it say form why would the
[47:38] prophet use it that way because it's a
[47:40] dispensation right amen
[47:44] right there was a dispensation of the
[47:47] Old Testament y Jehovah God there was a
[47:50] dispensation of Jesus Christ on earth
[47:53] now it's the dispensation of the Holy
[47:54] Spirit right amen who is our tutor our
[47:58] razor y but that's the father coming on
[48:01] the scene in you and me sister Gil it's
[48:04] not the Holy Spirit reporting to the
[48:06] father trying to tell the father how see
[48:09] you said well that's what brother Brown
[48:10] said well you know what he's
[48:14] saying right he's not explaining two or
[48:17] three Gods right he's making a story or
[48:20] an
[48:22] illustration he's dealing with
[48:24] dispensation
[48:26] right the father is trying to get his
[48:29] nature instill into the son right and
[48:32] that's exactly what happened to the Lord
[48:34] Jesus
[48:36] right that he was God Almighty
[48:38] manifested in flesh right and he went
[48:41] through these things remember the life
[48:43] message he had a river Jordan he had a
[48:46] baptismal he had a a time that the Holy
[48:48] Spirit come down and identified him this
[48:52] is my beloved Son in whom I pleased to
[48:54] dwell what
[48:56] then he had a Time on Mount of
[48:57] transfiguration this is my beloved Son
[48:59] in whom I pleased to dwell hear ye him
[49:02] right see deeper greater things right
[49:06] but the same
[49:08] God right right amen see he went through
[49:11] these things for you and I that we might
[49:13] be able to go through
[49:15] them so then don't as we're we're
[49:17] talking about the
[49:20] tutor the holy spirit being your
[49:24] razor just put that in your mind and
[49:27] think about it that it's the very nature
[49:29] of almighty God
[49:31] right right it's not a second person
[49:34] coming in to you and live out a little
[49:36] while in you and then he's answering to
[49:37] the third person and this it's just
[49:39] trying to explain things to it as human
[49:42] Mortals that's
[49:45] right like I told Brother dick out there
[49:47] a while ago I said we've been 40
[49:50] years over 40 years since the prophet
[49:52] left and we needed every day of it and
[49:54] we need 40 more years that's right amen
[49:57] that's true right we need 40 more years
[50:00] of the S the deepen the teaching of yet
[50:03] but we done covered one God have
[50:06] we we've done covered predestination
[50:10] have we I preached predestination ever
[50:12] since I've been in this message but you
[50:14] know I seen here a while back the for
[50:15] knowledge preceded or went before forign
[50:17] knowledge I mean before the
[50:20] predestination
[50:22] right and that helped me amen you see
[50:25] what I seen not all along well did you
[50:28] right
[50:29] BL I saw it yeah but I didn't see it my
[50:33] Revelation a lot of difference in the
[50:35] two right amen you can talk about a lot
[50:38] of things here we've covered one God
[50:40] we've covered water baptism we've
[50:41] covered marriage and divorce but have
[50:43] we why is there so many doctrines around
[50:46] the world about this about who Jesus
[50:48] whether whether it was River Jordan or
[50:50] whether there's two gods or whether
[50:51] there's you know how many they are and
[50:53] what's going on what's the problem
[50:56] well that's just your way of seeing
[50:58] it well if my way is what the Bible says
[51:01] and I'll just stay with my way right you
[51:04] know and you come and show me that it's
[51:07] not don't come along and oh but I want
[51:09] to explain to you the difference between
[51:11] the Holy Spirit and the father oh
[51:17] my it's a selfs same person amen but
[51:20] it's the way he manifest himself right
[51:24] right all right right now see the
[51:29] tutor that Paul was speaking
[51:34] of was the
[51:37] one that would come on the scene and
[51:40] make way you know
[51:45] for in other words God had to come in
[51:47] human flesh make way that you and I
[51:50] could become the children of God right
[51:54] all right then when we become the
[51:56] children of God then we're in line of
[51:59] adoption after our child
[52:01] training you know and I I've done it
[52:05] deliberately I held the quotes and the
[52:07] things of the life message and I told
[52:10] you I was doing it I held it to just
[52:13] down to the point of saying the new
[52:17] birth is what makes us the Sons and
[52:20] Daughters of God and then that new birth
[52:22] brings the tutor into
[52:26] us to teach us so the father's not
[52:31] gone right was God gone somewhere off
[52:34] into the to the Heavenly Heaven
[52:36] somewhere and left Jesus
[52:39] byself no that was still almighty God
[52:43] Amen Y and what are
[52:46] we see then the holy spirit being the
[52:49] tutor is the nature of the father right
[52:53] but it's as a baby as we when we've read
[52:55] it so many times there in Ephesians
[52:57] where we receive the earnest of our
[53:00] inheritance right it just makes us a
[53:03] baby but the prophet I gave you a bunch
[53:06] of quotes and things on the to know
[53:07] where he said that's where the
[53:08] Pentecostal people failed he said they
[53:11] said well we've got it y well us bapst
[53:14] said
[53:16] that right us badst said we got it all
[53:19] when we
[53:21] believe well the Pentecostals come along
[53:24] and they just said we got it all when we
[53:26] shouted and we spoke in
[53:29] tongues and I've heard both the ends of
[53:31] the scales I told you about sitting
[53:32] talking with two men one night one of
[53:34] them went this way and he said I got
[53:36] when I got my new birth I fully adopted
[53:38] son of God right into the body fully
[53:40] adopted headstone everything another guy
[53:43] on the other side was sitting there and
[53:44] he said you didn't get
[53:48] nothing did you don't even have the Holy
[53:50] Ghost yet I said well Brothers let me
[53:53] somewhere stay between both of
[53:56] you know yeah I just want to help them
[53:58] you know to be friends but I I was just
[54:01] plainly telling them I somewhere in
[54:03] between there is where I'm dwelling
[54:05] right Butz I believe in the new birth I
[54:08] believe that makes you a child of God
[54:10] right like I told you that no man is a
[54:14] match for the devil we believe that but
[54:16] the holy spirit in the least member of
[54:19] the body of Christ is not just a match
[54:21] for the Devil he's the devil's God right
[54:24] amen
[54:26] amen and one day he'll bow to that right
[54:30] amen because he's he's our we're his
[54:33] master
[54:35] right all but
[54:39] listen I wrote it down see we don't get
[54:42] a holy ghost as a
[54:44] tutor and then some of these days we'll
[54:47] come up to another place that the father
[54:50] will come on the
[54:53] S no no it's just stages or
[54:57] dispensations or or whatever that you
[55:00] want to make it I'm trying to just make
[55:02] it in an understanding that it comes in
[55:05] and and you don't like to use the word
[55:06] degrees because people don't like that
[55:09] they don't like for you to say well it's
[55:11] negative to positive so you have to go
[55:13] from partial to perfect right brother R
[55:16] didn't have any trouble dealing with
[55:17] negative to positive right he sure used
[55:21] it he must have known what he's talking
[55:23] about but
[55:28] see you and I must receive the new birth
[55:33] to be in the family see whereas in the
[55:37] natural form of adoption the prophet is
[55:39] using as an example unto us the son was
[55:43] born into the family at his natural
[55:46] birth right
[55:48] amen then brought up to the adoption
[55:53] position in the new verse Earth we must
[55:55] receive the new birth to come into the
[55:57] family of God right and then we can
[56:00] start the child training we can be like
[56:02] the scripture says uh in 1 Peter 1:23
[56:05] Peter says being born again right
[56:09] something going on being be iing I
[56:12] argued with the Baptist when I was back
[56:13] there I said it said he that
[56:15] believeth and his baptized shall be
[56:18] saved I said you're saying he that
[56:21] believes it doesn't say that it said
[56:23] believe right you know cuz I didn't like
[56:26] that that form of doing but Peter said
[56:29] going on in second Peter he said as
[56:31] newborn babes Desiring the sincere milk
[56:36] of the word that's right every person
[56:39] from the time of the ACT book of Acts
[56:42] 120 in the upper room they were tutored
[56:44] and trained in the Holy Ghost fail give
[56:46] them the faith of the fathers right but
[56:49] the 3,000 outside started out as babies
[56:52] they just heard one
[56:53] sermon
[56:56] and they receive the new birth see so
[56:59] then look at everything in child
[57:01] training are stages are are you know
[57:05] growth
[57:06] development whatever you can do in your
[57:09] mind to to make it into your way of
[57:12] thinking but just remember
[57:18] now that you and I must first be born
[57:22] again right
[57:26] the prophet of God said that's the most
[57:28] important thing in the world right is
[57:31] whether or not you're born again that's
[57:33] right am well I don't want to raise a
[57:37] hand I don't want anything I'm just
[57:39] asking you do you know you're born
[57:44] again if not then I would be seeking God
[57:47] Amen that's
[57:49] right oh I know what that is though that
[57:52] devil get on you so oh don't you deny
[57:54] anything now you got to be positive well
[57:57] that's what I'm trying to be as
[58:00] positive I'm as positive as can be if
[58:03] you're not born again you're lost right
[58:06] how much more positive can I get
[58:09] amen no more than I could say that I was
[58:12] born into the World by some other
[58:15] Mechanical Devices other than my mother
[58:17] and
[58:18] father no I wasn't an illegal alien that
[58:22] b down
[58:23] here
[58:27] I had a natural birth didn't
[58:29] you well I must have a spiritual birth
[58:33] right see all right and doing that
[58:38] then then we come to the basis that that
[58:41] the quotes tonight will be being
[58:44] used as to talk
[58:47] about how that that tutor or razor and
[58:51] what he's been
[58:53] doing
[58:57] now he didn't give us an intellectual
[59:00] something to to raise us now listen to
[59:03] the way I say it the five-fold ministry
[59:06] is for the perfecting of the Saints we
[59:08] believe that right amen but you know
[59:10] five-fold Ministry is not the Holy
[59:12] Spirit now the Holy Spirit uses the
[59:15] fivefold ministry okay fine we're all
[59:17] right but the holy the holy spirit is
[59:20] your inside teacher right amen right
[59:23] right he's the Advocate he's all the
[59:26] things we need the comforter Etc and you
[59:28] know what you get that when you're born
[59:30] again
[59:31] right you don't grow in Grace and
[59:33] knowledge and then find out you got an
[59:35] advocate he was D when you born again
[59:39] amen he was the Healer he's the Savior
[59:42] he's
[59:43] everything in that new
[59:47] birth all right see then in doing
[59:52] it now watch it tonight or point is
[59:57] what that brother Brandon will tell you
[59:59] the Pentecostals made a
[1:00:03] mistake of thinking they got
[1:00:08] everything so now you go around in the
[1:00:11] message and you talk to people
[1:00:15] right and you'll find out that they
[1:00:17] don't believe in not listen to the
[1:00:21] wording you find out they don't believe
[1:00:23] in the teaching of the Bible for the
[1:00:25] prophet's message
[1:00:28] right oh yeah they read it they said no
[1:00:31] they don't believe in the teaching of it
[1:00:33] right
[1:00:36] amen they don't believe that they need
[1:00:38] somebody to teach them that
[1:00:40] right they believe like brother R said
[1:00:43] they believe they say we've got an
[1:00:45] inside teacher we don't need a teacher
[1:00:49] he said well then why did God put
[1:00:51] teachers in the body you know the fold
[1:00:54] Ministry
[1:00:55] that's right but you see that's what
[1:00:57] people will do and I'm talking about
[1:00:59] preachers I'm talking about
[1:01:00] congregations I'm talking about around
[1:01:02] the
[1:01:05] world cuz they don't believe him right
[1:01:08] but now brother D now brother I'm
[1:01:11] telling you now you you're just all
[1:01:12] messed up and you're thinking okay all
[1:01:14] right you you you you just don't
[1:01:17] understand about everybody
[1:01:19] else okay I ain't going to argue with
[1:01:23] you I evidently don't think like they do
[1:01:26] cuz I Don't Preach like they do but I'm
[1:01:29] going to make a statement to
[1:01:30] you and I want you to think about it for
[1:01:33] a while and if I finish the message I'll
[1:01:35] explain it tonight if I don't I'll wait
[1:01:37] till
[1:01:38] Sunday I want to ask you a simple
[1:01:43] question and you'll see why we've been
[1:01:45] here 40 years or 44 Rel right you know
[1:01:50] somewhere close to
[1:01:53] that
[1:01:55] how do you get the virtues in the Statue
[1:01:58] of a perfect
[1:02:02] man all right now most of you have been
[1:02:04] around long enough you've heard me
[1:02:05] preach on it over and over and over and
[1:02:07] over so you ought to be able to answer
[1:02:09] me at least the
[1:02:12] words but how do you get
[1:02:17] it you show me one church and I'm as
[1:02:20] serious as I can be folks I'm
[1:02:23] not
[1:02:25] you show me one Church where they
[1:02:28] preach dress hire clothes and women and
[1:02:32] what they're doing and this that and the
[1:02:33] other ever service and I'll show you
[1:02:35] that they're still doing the same thing
[1:02:37] after 40
[1:02:47] years see what we look at it is we think
[1:02:50] that we just need faith and so what we
[1:02:52] need to do we just need to preach faith
[1:02:54] you but need preach
[1:02:56] Faith you all right I agree with
[1:03:00] you but then we say we need virtal well
[1:03:02] let's just preach on virtue we'll just
[1:03:04] preach about 20 years on virtues and
[1:03:06] we'll you on virtue we'll get
[1:03:08] virtue well had 40 years where you at
[1:03:17] right you see I don't mind saing no
[1:03:22] time because you're looking at a man has
[1:03:24] never been that
[1:03:26] way you're looking at a man has tried
[1:03:28] his best to bring
[1:03:30] you the message of the hour in this best
[1:03:34] that could ever be
[1:03:36] brought and not my own opinion
[1:03:40] right but yet where is the
[1:03:43] popularity they'd rather have a guy
[1:03:45] that's made 15 predictions and none of
[1:03:47] them come to pass they'd rather have
[1:03:48] somebody just gone off in adultery
[1:03:50] literally and spiritually especially
[1:03:52] than to hear somebody that really they
[1:03:54] can stand and talk about the
[1:03:58] word now you won't admit it but you know
[1:04:01] that's
[1:04:02] true right you know it's true sure
[1:04:06] you've been around long enough most of
[1:04:07] you have you know it's
[1:04:09] true will it bring virtue for us to
[1:04:12] preach on
[1:04:14] virtue will it bring patience for us to
[1:04:17] beat each other
[1:04:19] up why now you going to get patience oh
[1:04:22] brother they have tribulation working
[1:04:23] patience
[1:04:28] is that going to bring
[1:04:30] it
[1:04:32] right how can you tie together your new
[1:04:36] birth with your
[1:04:39] adoption as I said when I
[1:04:41] started it stages I don't know how to
[1:04:45] explain
[1:04:47] it
[1:04:49] stages you
[1:04:50] know doings one after the other but it's
[1:04:54] all the same work of the Holy Spirit
[1:04:56] right amen the holy spirit that
[1:04:59] justified you will sanctify you and
[1:05:01] it'll baptize you into the body Y and
[1:05:04] that's not three works of
[1:05:06] Grace right that's three stages of the
[1:05:10] same
[1:05:13] Grace but how can we get these
[1:05:18] things can you tie together your
[1:05:20] Doctrine with your new
[1:05:23] birth
[1:05:26] well now naturally if all you know about
[1:05:28] the New Birth is that I shouted screamed
[1:05:30] cried PL you know done this that the
[1:05:31] other if that's all you know about the
[1:05:33] New Birth then uh no wonder you can't
[1:05:36] tie nothing
[1:05:39] together but I thought the new birth was
[1:05:41] the birth of the word
[1:05:44] amen I mean that's the way I believe it
[1:05:47] I believe the new birth is the birth of
[1:05:49] the
[1:05:51] word so then the headstone would be all
[1:05:54] the word right right
[1:05:58] amen well it's being born
[1:06:01] again something's going
[1:06:04] on that Holy Spirit has been leading us
[1:06:07] and drawing
[1:06:09] us
[1:06:11] upward
[1:06:13] right by the preaching of the
[1:06:17] Gospel see one of these days you'll
[1:06:20] understand why brother Dale does like he
[1:06:23] does that I never felt led to go back
[1:06:26] and literally take the seals one after
[1:06:28] the other and preach on them
[1:06:31] again and a lot of you are listening to
[1:06:33] them
[1:06:34] now and
[1:06:36] saying well you know what it sound just
[1:06:39] like you're talking right now that's 82
[1:06:42] 83 84
[1:06:45] right because you don't have to go back
[1:06:47] and preach it again cuz it's still
[1:06:49] stands right but I'm just trying to make
[1:06:51] a point now
[1:06:53] listen
[1:06:55] see we we wonder well why isn't things
[1:06:57] going
[1:06:59] on now you don't pray for rain and a
[1:07:02] monso
[1:07:05] season
[1:07:08] right I mean is that
[1:07:10] sensible I mean you got a monso season
[1:07:12] dumping inches of rain on you every day
[1:07:14] and everything's floody and everything
[1:07:16] and you say well I'm going to pray for
[1:07:18] rain now you want to pray for it to
[1:07:21] quit right
[1:07:25] what you see it's got to be dry in other
[1:07:28] words to pray for rain so it have to be
[1:07:31] a
[1:07:33] drought for you to really get down to
[1:07:35] Pray For Rain if you're not sick you're
[1:07:39] you're not praying to be healed are you
[1:07:43] right so many are the afflictions of the
[1:07:45] righteous but the Lord leadth out of
[1:07:47] them
[1:07:48] all it doesn't make me down and out
[1:07:50] because that we're sick and and problems
[1:07:52] and troubles and heartaches yes it does
[1:07:54] on one basis because I would sure love
[1:07:56] to see every one of us healed delivered
[1:08:00] walk away here in glorified bodies
[1:08:02] tonight right yes sir read amen I'd love
[1:08:06] to see every one of us be able to even
[1:08:08] just be changed back to young man to
[1:08:09] young woman let alone a change and go up
[1:08:12] into the glory right because with that
[1:08:14] would automatically come a whole lot
[1:08:17] better position than we're living
[1:08:20] in but where is that going to change us
[1:08:30] all
[1:08:31] right see then the prophet tells you
[1:08:34] what our troubl
[1:08:40] is you know what our trouble is you know
[1:08:42] what my trouble is
[1:08:45] me my trouble's not
[1:08:48] you m my trouble is
[1:08:52] me your trouble
[1:08:54] is the one you looking in the mirror at
[1:08:56] when you look and you know right right
[1:08:59] there's your trouble right it's not
[1:09:02] somebody else cuz ain't nobody big
[1:09:04] enough to get in front of you kind like
[1:09:05] brother M was that time when they here
[1:09:07] Ling this old boy was the law come up
[1:09:09] and they was doing a bunch of things and
[1:09:11] this old boy run over to hide and he he
[1:09:12] hid behind a tu before you know a
[1:09:17] post well the policeman walked over
[1:09:19] there and said what are you doing he
[1:09:20] said
[1:09:22] hiding there was a whole whole lot more
[1:09:24] of him outside than there was he you
[1:09:27] know and that's our problem is me and
[1:09:34] you now here is some things that you
[1:09:37] will not
[1:09:40] like because you won't
[1:09:44] understand when the prophet of God in
[1:09:47] some of these quotes that we give he
[1:09:49] said your sons and daughters
[1:09:52] are doing things
[1:09:57] wrong he said they become organizational
[1:10:02] minded he said they're out doing things
[1:10:05] of the
[1:10:06] world he said they're staying home from
[1:10:08] church and watching
[1:10:13] television he says your daughters are
[1:10:16] wearing immoral
[1:10:20] clothing I tell you bless God that ain't
[1:10:23] me
[1:10:25] brother he he was talking about people
[1:10:27] that was lost now you go argue with
[1:10:31] him remember he was the
[1:10:36] prophet and he was the one that the Holy
[1:10:39] Spirit had to straighten out one day
[1:10:41] when he said you quit calling my
[1:10:43] children Ricky and ricketta you remember
[1:10:47] that he said that's my
[1:10:50] children well you know what he was
[1:10:52] saying he was calling Ricky and Rickett
[1:10:54] you know what because they were Ricky
[1:10:56] and Rickett
[1:10:57] right they were living just like Ricky
[1:11:00] and they were living like
[1:11:04] rickettes he had every right humanly to
[1:11:06] say that but the holy spirit said you're
[1:11:09] talking about my
[1:11:14] children you see we're so
[1:11:16] judgmental and that's one of the things
[1:11:18] the prophet
[1:11:20] uses to talk about that we don't come to
[1:11:23] adoption because of that fussing and
[1:11:25] arguing and little petty feelings and
[1:11:31] things but brother Dale you believe he's
[1:11:33] just living like the
[1:11:35] devil I've explained
[1:11:38] that but I've also explained that I
[1:11:41] don't believe in a big sin and a little
[1:11:46] sin I've tried to be as much as I could
[1:11:49] to explain those things even to Breaking
[1:11:52] Down The Body Spirit spirit and soul to
[1:11:54] show that that it's not the soul that
[1:11:57] sinth because if it is then that soul is
[1:12:00] lost but in our spirit and our body
[1:12:04] we do things wrong and you ask brother
[1:12:07] brandham said brother brandham do you
[1:12:09] sin he said every day
[1:12:13] right now is that right did he say that
[1:12:17] amen he's not sin every day was was he
[1:12:19] sinning in his soul or was he s in his
[1:12:21] body and spirit oh he's just sinning in
[1:12:22] his soul well that's he was just sinning
[1:12:24] in his soul he's lost
[1:12:26] right man that's
[1:12:29] blun
[1:12:32] right but you see through the opening of
[1:12:34] the word we can know the
[1:12:37] difference I'll get back to it in a few
[1:12:39] minutes but I just want to talk about
[1:12:43] it but random says
[1:12:48] what you've got them you read
[1:12:52] them he said he has to bring a report to
[1:12:55] the father of our
[1:13:02] Disobedience now do any of us have
[1:13:06] Disobedience we're going to take on the
[1:13:08] next
[1:13:11] uh time that we have Bible study it's
[1:13:13] going to be on Galatians 5 works of the
[1:13:17] flesh you think you got works of the
[1:13:19] flesh no sir read I think I said murder
[1:13:22] adultery
[1:13:24] you break that word down amen that's
[1:13:29] right right get a dictionary and see
[1:13:32] what that word murder means
[1:13:36] sorry and remember the prophet said if
[1:13:39] you kill anybody's influence you've
[1:13:40] murdered them that's right of course we
[1:13:43] don't do
[1:13:46] that you
[1:13:48] see I'm just trying to lay down a
[1:13:51] point because
[1:13:54] if you and I
[1:13:56] now you're not going to like this point
[1:13:58] but I'm going to make
[1:13:59] it there's a lot of quotes here the
[1:14:02] prophet covers about our Disobedience
[1:14:04] and about how that we are not lined up
[1:14:06] and how that we we stay at home on watch
[1:14:10] TV on Wednesdays or whatever we do and
[1:14:13] and that we're we're trying to be we
[1:14:15] want to be intellectuals to be rais that
[1:14:17] away and and all other things but you
[1:14:19] know if we got every bit of this
[1:14:22] straight
[1:14:25] if we could line up everything this
[1:14:27] Prophet says right
[1:14:29] here and I'm waving before the
[1:14:31] congregation I don't know probably 30
[1:14:35] quotes and I believe every one of
[1:14:37] them but if we could line everyone up
[1:14:40] with
[1:14:42] that it still be no Rapture
[1:14:48] right be a better people but not a
[1:14:50] Rapture
[1:14:52] right
[1:14:56] it would not bring one New Birth if we
[1:14:58] lined up to everything that's in here
[1:15:00] right that's
[1:15:03] right that's strong is
[1:15:05] it to know that you're prophet in the
[1:15:08] way he
[1:15:09] preached but he's the ones that's
[1:15:11] telling us that's the way it
[1:15:14] is if we could line up our lives until
[1:15:16] we lived a total Perfection of
[1:15:19] perfection it would not save us right it
[1:15:23] would make us more lost than ever
[1:15:28] right you
[1:15:29] agree
[1:15:31] amen you see we're looking at it in a
[1:15:34] way I've always seen people when they
[1:15:35] look at adoption we're going to we're
[1:15:37] going to keep going like this one of
[1:15:38] these days we're going to start getting
[1:15:39] better and we're going to start getting
[1:15:41] better and we're going to start getting
[1:15:42] better and Bo we'll just find we'll just
[1:15:44] get so good until we walk off the
[1:15:49] earth I wish that was
[1:15:51] true amen
[1:15:55] but the more the Lord Jesus came in
[1:15:57] contact and the more he came into
[1:15:59] Authority the worse things got around
[1:16:02] him not in him now but around
[1:16:07] him think on
[1:16:09] it he says we're not progressing because
[1:16:12] that we're not listening to
[1:16:17] him a lot of quotes
[1:16:21] here I hope I'm getting my point across
[1:16:23] at least for one thing I know it don't
[1:16:25] don't seem to be but still I'm
[1:16:28] trying if we lined up to everything the
[1:16:31] prophet of God had to say
[1:16:34] right we would be no closer to adoption
[1:16:39] right I said if
[1:16:42] we we
[1:16:44] we lined up if we could get ourselves
[1:16:48] lined
[1:16:50] up it wouldn't be no closer
[1:16:57] because you see God's got a away amen
[1:17:01] it's going to be his way that's right
[1:17:05] yeah he's not going to send the
[1:17:07] headstone your Prophet said because of
[1:17:09] your
[1:17:11] merits he said he'll send it because he
[1:17:14] promised it
[1:17:19] am boy you sure are a funny preacher
[1:17:22] because you don't believe in living
[1:17:23] right no I don't believe in living right
[1:17:25] I don't I've made that plain I know
[1:17:27] people don't understand you cut your
[1:17:29] tape off you really got me there had you
[1:17:32] I believe in being born
[1:17:35] again I believe that the tutors coming
[1:17:38] inside of you right the razor inside of
[1:17:40] you the father's inside of you I believe
[1:17:43] the new birth is Father Son and Holy
[1:17:45] Ghost dwelling in you
[1:17:47] amen that's
[1:17:51] right all
[1:17:54] and see that way let him live out right
[1:17:56] right
[1:17:58] amen and just remember then no matter
[1:18:01] how good that it comes that we can live
[1:18:04] we would never be able to reach a
[1:18:09] Perfection therefore it's talking about
[1:18:11] be therefore perfect even as your father
[1:18:13] in Heaven is perfect that is not talking
[1:18:16] about stopping doing things
[1:18:21] right that's not it
[1:18:24] is taking his
[1:18:27] nature and depending upon your
[1:18:31] sacrifice well you the way you sound
[1:18:33] it's just it's okay to go do anything
[1:18:36] now if I've got to explain that to this
[1:18:38] congregation that's setting here now
[1:18:40] maybe out there on the internet maybe
[1:18:42] they're listening they don't understand
[1:18:43] me I I know that but if I've got to
[1:18:45] explain to this
[1:18:47] church that I believe in just living
[1:18:49] like a garbage can everything going to
[1:18:52] be all right right
[1:18:55] no right but I believe Sons and
[1:18:58] Daughters of God have trouble right
[1:19:03] amen and I believe what your Prophet
[1:19:07] said but you don't even listen to him
[1:19:12] see brother Brown made a statement he
[1:19:15] makes a lot of statements about that he
[1:19:17] made a statement one time that really
[1:19:19] was concerning me a
[1:19:21] lot cuz he said I don't preach because
[1:19:24] I'm
[1:19:25] saved you remember that
[1:19:30] right he said I Don't Preach because I'm
[1:19:35] saved he said because I'm saved whether
[1:19:38] I preach or
[1:19:43] not but you better swallow it because
[1:19:45] you better finish the rest of the
[1:19:47] statement brother around
[1:19:49] make he said if I go out here on on the
[1:19:53] creek bank and sit down and Don't Preach
[1:19:56] no
[1:19:58] more I'm still
[1:20:03] safe now if you go out on the creek bank
[1:20:06] and you sit down you're not in
[1:20:18] church but see he's making a point right
[1:20:21] right cuz his point
[1:20:25] is I say because I I preach because I
[1:20:28] love
[1:20:30] God right not because I'm saved or
[1:20:32] anything that's right amen
[1:20:34] that's I preach because he called me and
[1:20:37] I want to help his people
[1:20:39] right now he ain't going out on the
[1:20:41] creek bank and sitting down is
[1:20:44] he he's just making a strong
[1:20:51] point just like he's making a point when
[1:20:54] he says your sons and daughters are out
[1:20:56] here living in the world and he's
[1:20:58] talking
[1:20:59] about
[1:21:03] Christians no no no no no he's not
[1:21:06] talking about born again he's talking
[1:21:07] about church
[1:21:09] Christians
[1:21:12] well why is he explaining so much about
[1:21:15] the
[1:21:16] tutor he's explaining that he give you
[1:21:19] the tutor and you got the tutor and
[1:21:20] still go out and do wrong
[1:21:26] Now
[1:21:27] read do I need to read
[1:21:32] it he's explaining that he gave you the
[1:21:34] tutor and you're still doing
[1:21:40] wrong cuz you see we're not looking at
[1:21:42] it the way he's talking about
[1:21:44] it he said a child is a
[1:21:48] child and he says there's nothing you
[1:21:50] can do to get away from being a child
[1:21:54] right but he said adoption is your
[1:21:57] growth
[1:21:58] development or your tutoring or
[1:22:07] training then we look at it as thinking
[1:22:09] that if there would be some way that I
[1:22:11] could get better I'd get
[1:22:17] adopted
[1:22:20] right right now
[1:22:23] why would it say that Jesus grew in
[1:22:25] Grace and knowledge why does it say
[1:22:34] that you youever thought about the
[1:22:36] scripture say that you know
[1:22:38] yeah and that being a child learned he
[1:22:43] obedience by the things that he
[1:22:45] suffered and being made
[1:22:51] perfect
[1:22:54] but you know them people that was there
[1:22:56] with the money changers and the things
[1:22:58] like that did they really think he is
[1:23:00] perfect when he platted a rope and run
[1:23:03] them out right uh people in this message
[1:23:07] see they try to explain everything I
[1:23:09] know a couple of Brothers tried their
[1:23:10] best to explain that to me one time and
[1:23:12] they said well what he done now he
[1:23:14] didn't beat the
[1:23:16] people that he beat the
[1:23:20] animals I said man that's worse that's
[1:23:22] right absolutely animals didn't have
[1:23:24] anything to do with getting in there the
[1:23:26] people took them in
[1:23:29] there but you see it sounded good that
[1:23:32] he didn't beat the people he beat the
[1:23:36] animals well that make him a hypocrite
[1:23:41] right because he'd be beating the
[1:23:43] animals and the Animals had nothing to
[1:23:44] do with getting in there right I said
[1:23:47] y'all making it
[1:23:50] worse but see it didn't change
[1:23:54] that cuz once you get that thing in your
[1:23:56] mind you just going to play around with
[1:23:57] them little
[1:24:00] things what you
[1:24:03] see what brother Brandon would call
[1:24:06] Christians we call
[1:24:10] Devils
[1:24:15] right you know did he said Billy Graham
[1:24:17] had the baptism of the Holy
[1:24:21] Ghost
[1:24:26] old
[1:24:31] robbers
[1:24:34] huh but you see we we want to look at it
[1:24:36] so that we've gauged it so much until if
[1:24:41] if there's any little Mark we're just
[1:24:42] not a Christian no
[1:24:47] more brother R said about many men in
[1:24:50] this message and he said they got the
[1:24:52] baptis G and the Holy Ghost you said now
[1:24:53] what they got is they got it on their
[1:24:55] Spirit Well now maybe that might be
[1:24:58] right I'm going going to argue with
[1:25:03] you I'm going to just say that's up
[1:25:05] between you and brother Brown talk
[1:25:10] about see see because we think that
[1:25:13] we've got to the point and and it's
[1:25:15] never been taught that here so you you
[1:25:17] got to had it somewhere else because I
[1:25:19] never taught it I never taught some kind
[1:25:21] of a human profess ction In the Flesh
[1:25:24] right I've never done
[1:25:27] that I'm a firm believer in that there's
[1:25:29] none good no not one amen but I'm a firm
[1:25:33] believer in an
[1:25:34] atonement a sacrifice an
[1:25:38] advocate a
[1:25:41] conforter and I'm dependent upon
[1:25:46] him to make a way for me to do that see
[1:25:52] yep you Pentecostal people you jumped
[1:25:54] the fence you thought that when you were
[1:25:56] born again that settled
[1:26:00] it that was that only was the beginning
[1:26:03] that's right right you're a son surely
[1:26:06] when you're born but when this son was
[1:26:08] born he wasn't air of all things
[1:26:12] yet he had to go through the testings
[1:26:15] and trials to find out if he was the
[1:26:18] right type of
[1:26:21] son to fall air of all
[1:26:26] things don't you stay in
[1:26:29] it you say we've been here 40 something
[1:26:33] years and we're not no further up the
[1:26:35] road we preached all the doctrines I
[1:26:36] differ with you
[1:26:39] 100% we preached doctrines yes
[1:26:46] right
[1:26:49] doctrines Revelation is a lot of
[1:26:51] difference and the Revelation and
[1:26:56] Doctrine a lot of difference in the two
[1:27:00] words revelation will bring us to
[1:27:06] adoption but because we beat each other
[1:27:09] and holler and screamed at each other
[1:27:11] you know how many of you women wear long
[1:27:13] dresses because you're afraid somebody
[1:27:15] will say something to you about
[1:27:21] it
[1:27:24] or is it really from the inside that it
[1:27:26] wouldn't matter if you was out in the
[1:27:27] backs side of the desert you'd wear the
[1:27:29] same
[1:27:37] thing well if I had the Holy Spirit I
[1:27:40] would
[1:27:44] what he never sent an AR Bishop to be
[1:27:47] our tutor a general overseer or District
[1:27:51] man
[1:27:52] man there's where we've made our
[1:27:56] mistake who do you follow what group are
[1:27:58] you in you follow the Thunders the vires
[1:28:01] River Jordan Two
[1:28:02] Souls
[1:28:06] Lites brother Dale talks plain
[1:28:14] amen well I just I don't understand what
[1:28:16] you're talking about
[1:28:18] now I'm just trying to make one point to
[1:28:21] us
[1:28:25] we we are the only people that don't
[1:28:27] follow a
[1:28:30] man you ever thought of that we're
[1:28:32] accused of that right but every
[1:28:35] denomination has got a man they
[1:28:40] follow you said but I follow brother
[1:28:42] brand well see that's where your
[1:28:43] problems
[1:28:46] at Paul said follow me as I follow
[1:28:51] Christ if you follow the same Christ
[1:28:53] that brother brandham was following
[1:28:55] amen but if you're following Brother
[1:28:57] brandham Where are
[1:29:02] we we've got into archbishops and
[1:29:05] governors and general overseers
[1:29:08] and all of
[1:29:13] that if his character didn't show up
[1:29:17] right he didn't inherit
[1:29:20] anything he was just a
[1:29:23] son now remember I explained
[1:29:27] that if you're truly born again there's
[1:29:30] no way if you die and go to hell cuz you
[1:29:31] can't lose your sunship you
[1:29:34] know right right but that don't mean we
[1:29:37] have all inheritance because we're try
[1:29:40] we've got to come through
[1:29:44] that but what are we talking
[1:29:50] about
[1:29:54] just looking down and reading some
[1:29:55] things you can read
[1:29:57] them the teacher must be an honest
[1:30:00] person not a man that wants the father
[1:30:02] to Pat him on the back but a man that'll
[1:30:05] be honest with the father if the child
[1:30:07] is disobedient he'll walk up with a
[1:30:09] shame face and say sir I'm sorry to
[1:30:13] bring this message but your child is so
[1:30:16] dilit he doesn't listen to nothing he's
[1:30:19] not concerned at all how the father must
[1:30:28] feel just thinking of these
[1:30:32] things what's the matter today we've
[1:30:34] adopted a different tutor for the Church
[1:30:37] of the Living God than what God gave
[1:30:42] us
[1:30:44] amen see we want man to lead us
[1:30:50] right and I admit around this message
[1:30:53] that that's what I see most of the
[1:30:55] people preachers want they want you to
[1:30:58] follow them
[1:31:01] right they'd be tickled to death if you
[1:31:03] wouldn't never make a decision unless
[1:31:05] you went and asked them whether to drive
[1:31:06] a Cadillac or a Buick or buy a house or
[1:31:09] whatever to do but please don't bother
[1:31:12] me with it tell me you pray about your
[1:31:14] decision to go buy something and I'll be
[1:31:15] glad to do that but I'm not going to
[1:31:17] counsel you about what kind of car or
[1:31:19] house to
[1:31:20] buy
[1:31:25] but that's what people
[1:31:28] want but you see I want the Holy Spirit
[1:31:30] to lead
[1:31:32] you and then I ain't got to worry about
[1:31:35] it I have no concern about somebody
[1:31:38] that's led by the Holy
[1:31:40] Spirit right you say well brother D the
[1:31:43] Holy Spirit told me to go here and not
[1:31:45] come to church for 3 months well you go
[1:31:48] do what the holy spirit said if you do
[1:31:49] now that kind of a doing I wouldn't
[1:31:51] agree with too much right but that's
[1:31:55] still up to
[1:31:56] you because it's you that's being child
[1:32:04] trained the holy spirit is to raise the
[1:32:06] church and nurture it in honor and
[1:32:09] respect to the father and of his
[1:32:16] word
[1:32:20] adoption how what's my son
[1:32:24] doing the father would
[1:32:31] ask he's the most hard-headed kid I ever
[1:32:34] seen in my
[1:32:38] life
[1:32:41] yeah that's number six on your notes
[1:32:45] going to get over
[1:32:46] read most hard-headed
[1:32:49] kid I've ever seen in my life
[1:32:53] now remember my
[1:32:58] point brother random is talking about
[1:33:00] all of these examples as someone with
[1:33:03] the
[1:33:11] tutor read right he's talking about
[1:33:15] somebody with the tutor that's
[1:33:18] hardheaded that don't go to church that
[1:33:20] lays out and just does what they want to
[1:33:23] arrogant and hateful and
[1:33:26] attitudes he's talking about people with
[1:33:29] the tutter Y but now now brother D he
[1:33:32] can't be meaning that got the Holy Ghost
[1:33:35] well now you got to talk to brother
[1:33:42] BR Brother D you it sounds like you're
[1:33:45] saying it's just okay for us just live
[1:33:47] anyway with the Holy
[1:33:50] Ghost
[1:33:52] noise I didn't say
[1:33:55] that where'd you get that
[1:33:59] idea well I got it from hearing what you
[1:34:05] say but you see these are babies he's
[1:34:08] talking
[1:34:13] about see little different story now
[1:34:18] right see you thought I was talking
[1:34:20] about it's okay just anything in the
[1:34:22] world now brother Brandon's talking
[1:34:23] about when you get the Holy Spirit
[1:34:25] you're just a
[1:34:26] baby and babies are the ones that are
[1:34:29] hardheaded and organizational minded and
[1:34:32] running here in Yonder and wearing the
[1:34:33] wrong clothes and laying out a church
[1:34:35] and doing these things every one of
[1:34:36] these he talking about a baby read
[1:34:39] him he ain't talking about a full grown
[1:34:41] a full grown person don't do
[1:34:50] that m
[1:34:52] I know how I've been around a while I
[1:34:55] know out of quote a little
[1:35:00] bit brother brother said you can't get a
[1:35:02] holy ghost filled woman put on a pair of
[1:35:07] pants now he didn't
[1:35:11] say a
[1:35:14] baby he said a holy ghost F
[1:35:20] woman because one day you was a
[1:35:27] baby naturally right we acted like
[1:35:31] babies right and when we got born again
[1:35:34] you know what we were that's where
[1:35:35] brother R said you Pentecostals is
[1:35:37] messed it up he said cuz you think you
[1:35:39] got everything when you got the new
[1:35:41] birth other words CU they run in spok in
[1:35:43] tongues like R said that lady said the
[1:35:46] brother so and so said run off the with
[1:35:47] the the piano player but said he called
[1:35:50] me the other day said he still got to
[1:35:51] Victory cuz he's speaking in tongues on
[1:35:53] the
[1:35:54] telephone well now you know I don't
[1:35:56] agree with
[1:36:01] that see you thought I was going some
[1:36:03] other
[1:36:04] way so now it's up to you to repent of
[1:36:07] what you thoughts
[1:36:09] were get back on track where I'm
[1:36:13] at I'm talking about the thing brother
[1:36:15] rown was talking about and you read them
[1:36:17] and
[1:36:17] see he's talking about babies right
[1:36:22] newborn
[1:36:24] babies that desire the sincere milk of
[1:36:26] the word to learn to do things and I am
[1:36:30] not
[1:36:32] saying that it's okay for you to do
[1:36:34] things
[1:36:36] wrong I'm just saying your Advocate is
[1:36:39] covering for
[1:36:44] you until you grow old enough in God to
[1:36:50] learn to live right
[1:36:58] right are you
[1:37:00] listening see you thought I was going
[1:37:02] some other way with that didn't
[1:37:04] you if I was you I would listen real
[1:37:07] careful before I made much statements in
[1:37:09] my
[1:37:10] mind you might find out we're following
[1:37:12] the right
[1:37:15] truth newborn babies are babies and
[1:37:18] that's the way they
[1:37:19] live they look around to see what
[1:37:22] clothes somebody's wearing or what
[1:37:24] somebody's doing or what they're saying
[1:37:26] or how they're
[1:37:29] acting cuz they're just like little
[1:37:33] babies little babies pay close attention
[1:37:36] little kids close attention to what you
[1:37:38] do that's why you better be careful
[1:37:40] where you do
[1:37:42] things right you better be careful
[1:37:45] around them little kids about 2 or 3
[1:37:46] years
[1:37:47] old you know why they going to act just
[1:37:50] like you
[1:37:53] that's right and then they going to be
[1:37:55] like the children were in the Bible you
[1:37:57] know went out there and said go up old
[1:37:58] bald
[1:38:00] head them kids wouldn't have made fun of
[1:38:03] that Prophet like that it was Mom and
[1:38:04] Daddy was making fun of the Prophet
[1:38:07] right abely what are you trying to get
[1:38:10] across brother Dale I'm trying to get
[1:38:12] across one thing in this message
[1:38:14] tonight let's get away from belittling
[1:38:17] one another looking down on one another
[1:38:20] trying to get everybody body else to
[1:38:21] line up and not lining ourselves up
[1:38:23] let's start working on our own
[1:38:31] s qu being so much judgmental is that
[1:38:34] some of the things the prophet let's see
[1:38:35] I wrote one of them down I had to look
[1:38:36] up the word but I'm sorry I'm just I'm
[1:38:40] not able to handle all these words like
[1:38:42] a lot of you
[1:38:43] are but let's see if I can find that one
[1:38:47] words brother call a diligent Dil there
[1:38:51] or something like that I had to look it
[1:38:52] up it
[1:38:53] means
[1:38:56] unworthy yeah in no excuse me Indigent i
[1:39:01] n d i g n a n
[1:39:04] d Indigent I guess You' say he said that
[1:39:07] means unworthy the Webster says you know
[1:39:11] brother R says that's what we are we're
[1:39:16] unworthy but you know God never throw a
[1:39:18] baby
[1:39:20] away
[1:39:23] I wish I could preach like a lot of
[1:39:27] people but I just have to tell you the
[1:39:29] way I think
[1:39:33] right when you're a newborn baby you act
[1:39:36] like a newborn
[1:39:41] baby you do like a newborn
[1:39:45] baby you'll lay out a church you'll just
[1:39:48] do what you want to you'll go and do
[1:39:49] things that you know
[1:39:56] but you see I want us to grow
[1:39:59] up not to learn not to sin now that's
[1:40:03] not what I'm talking about huh oh I had
[1:40:06] to grow in Grace like brother WBY said
[1:40:07] that lady said that time said I had to
[1:40:09] grow in Grace and knowledge before I
[1:40:10] could start going to the movie Pi show
[1:40:13] now that wasn't exactly what I'm talking
[1:40:16] about amen I don't think you can grow in
[1:40:19] Grace and knowledge through learn how to
[1:40:22] sin don't worry about it you already
[1:40:25] know
[1:40:26] right the day I got born again Bo I
[1:40:29] haven't had a dirty thought since then
[1:40:30] you're the biggest liar in the building
[1:40:38] am what you
[1:40:42] see babies act like
[1:40:48] babies maybe 71 years old
[1:40:53] yeah but act like
[1:40:57] babies what is the holy spirit going to
[1:40:59] report of Our
[1:41:07] Lives all
[1:41:09] right but you
[1:41:16] see why did Brother brandham not
[1:41:19] stay if all all you needed is uh lining
[1:41:25] up in your natural life
[1:41:29] things why did he not stay that way in
[1:41:33] his Doctrine right instead of preceding
[1:41:36] on into the opening of the word
[1:41:44] right you don't think like
[1:41:48] that you listen to the early message
[1:41:50] Mees of brother brandham and you listen
[1:41:52] to the later message of brother BR and
[1:41:54] and you'll think that brother brandham
[1:41:55] was doing the same thing brother Dale
[1:41:57] was doing a while ago that he was just
[1:41:59] backing up he was just saying it's all
[1:42:01] right to do anything in the
[1:42:06] world cuz you know what I'm saying it's
[1:42:08] right brother random in his early
[1:42:09] Ministry he hammered hard about clothes
[1:42:12] and and doings and life and living but
[1:42:16] in the end he said he didn't have time
[1:42:18] to preach on them he didn't have time to
[1:42:20] iate
[1:42:21] babies right he said I'm so concerned
[1:42:24] with this message that I am to bring
[1:42:30] Y and said don't you call them Ricky and
[1:42:32] Ricketts that's my
[1:42:43] children I would ask you to do one thing
[1:42:45] is to listen to this message
[1:42:48] again cuz I'm just talking
[1:42:53] I think this is a good way to get the
[1:42:54] point
[1:42:57] down we think that in 40 years we would
[1:43:00] have been able to some way make
[1:43:01] ourselves better W
[1:43:04] work right all of the Clos line Holiness
[1:43:07] and I firmly am a believer in clothline
[1:43:10] Holiness preacher
[1:43:14] amen I see a lot of stuff around here
[1:43:16] that I don't
[1:43:18] like but why don't you just preach
[1:43:20] against it well where has it ever done
[1:43:22] any
[1:43:24] good well go to the person that's doing
[1:43:27] it tell them or would that do any
[1:43:31] good and I'm not scared of running you
[1:43:35] off if I thought it'd run you off for me
[1:43:37] to go to you I would come to you in a
[1:43:41] hurry just take my word for it I'd come
[1:43:44] to you in a hurry if I thought it'd run
[1:43:45] you off but I know it won't because
[1:43:48] you'll sit there and S up and become a
[1:43:51] pickled up
[1:43:52] prun I ain't talking about brother Al
[1:43:55] either I can say things about
[1:44:01] him but you
[1:44:03] see there has never been but one thing
[1:44:06] that would ever bring this there's never
[1:44:08] been and never will be but one thing
[1:44:11] that'll ever bring this message I mean
[1:44:13] bring this people to
[1:44:17] adoption all right look at the last to
[1:44:20] the last
[1:44:29] quote number 11 on your
[1:44:32] notes there's never been but one
[1:44:35] thing that will ever bring this prde to
[1:44:39] adoption we cannot preach clothline
[1:44:43] Holiness hard enough and strong enough
[1:44:45] to bring it into
[1:44:47] manifestation because it'll always fall
[1:44:50] off
[1:44:53] somewhere 363 Church AG
[1:44:56] book they said a moment
[1:44:59] ago that the false Vine came into full
[1:45:02] futri in this age her fruit would mature
[1:45:05] and ripen that is correct this evil
[1:45:08] spirited Church full of iniquity will be
[1:45:11] revealed as the mustard seed that grew
[1:45:13] into a tree wherein Lodge the fowls of
[1:45:15] the Earth at her head will be the
[1:45:18] Antichrist the mystery of iniquity all
[1:45:21] this is true and if this is true then it
[1:45:24] must also be true that the bride church
[1:45:27] WIll mature and her ripness shall be an
[1:45:32] identification with her Lord by means of
[1:45:36] the
[1:45:38] word I don't underline that if I you and
[1:45:42] her head who will come to her is the
[1:45:45] mystery of
[1:45:47] godliness now what is godliness brother
[1:45:50] around said I looked everywhere to try
[1:45:51] to find what godliness is he said to be
[1:45:54] like
[1:45:58] God all right I thought that would be
[1:46:01] the nature of the
[1:46:03] father and her head who will come to her
[1:46:06] is the mystery of godliness which indeed
[1:46:08] is Christ and as the false church with
[1:46:11] all cunning and diabolical power made up
[1:46:14] of political force physical force and
[1:46:17] demons of Darkness come against this
[1:46:19] true bride the true true vine the True
[1:46:23] Vine with the fullness of the spirit and
[1:46:25] the word will do the very acts of power
[1:46:29] that Jesus
[1:46:31] did
[1:46:32] okay then as she nears her headstone
[1:46:36] becoming like him through the word Jesus
[1:46:39] will
[1:46:40] come that the bride and the groom may be
[1:46:42] forever United as
[1:46:45] one already the visible
[1:46:48] manifestation stations are of what I
[1:46:50] have been telling you are seen all
[1:46:53] around us The ecumenical move of the
[1:46:56] tires is
[1:46:58] factual but also it is a fact that the
[1:47:00] prophet for the last age must be
[1:47:03] bringing forth a message from God that
[1:47:05] will forun the second coming of the Lord
[1:47:08] for by his message will the hearts of
[1:47:10] the children be turned back to the
[1:47:11] Pentecostal fathers and with the
[1:47:14] restoration of the word will come the
[1:47:17] restoration of power right you want
[1:47:21] power power apart from character is
[1:47:26] satanic
[1:47:28] right that's what the prophet
[1:47:30] said so what is it characterist lady
[1:47:36] oia is what your Prophet said it is what
[1:47:40] about
[1:47:43] it do we want a character that's molded
[1:47:46] by
[1:47:49] suffering
[1:47:51] or we don't or do we want a character
[1:47:52] that's molded by a characterless lady of
[1:47:54] see and
[1:47:55] age right which one is
[1:47:58] it that's
[1:48:02] name which one is
[1:48:07] it come on
[1:48:10] brother I hope you go back and listen to
[1:48:13] this
[1:48:15] message don't talk to me and tell me
[1:48:18] what it sounded like go back and listen
[1:48:19] to the miss
[1:48:24] that cuz if you say it to me so you
[1:48:26] should I want just tell you so go back
[1:48:28] listen the
[1:48:30] message if there's anybody believes in
[1:48:32] living rights you know I
[1:48:35] do you know I don't believe in just
[1:48:37] being any kind of a garbage
[1:48:41] can but I know little
[1:48:45] babies and don't matter how old they are
[1:48:48] they still little babies
[1:48:51] right they may have been around to
[1:48:52] message for 20 30 40 years but they're
[1:48:55] still little
[1:49:00] babies still wanting sugar tits to be
[1:49:03] able to just little sermons and sermon
[1:49:05] and P you on the back and tell you how
[1:49:07] good and then oh boy that preacher he
[1:49:10] really got all over my toes well why
[1:49:12] don't you put your shoes
[1:49:15] on get the toes out of the
[1:49:19] way
[1:49:22] what do you say down there is no way to
[1:49:25] come to adoption the way people's
[1:49:27] preached it
[1:49:32] right but I'll tell you one thing that
[1:49:35] from day one when I saw what that
[1:49:36] Prophet has said I've tried to preach
[1:49:38] the Revelation to give you an
[1:49:41] opportunity by Revelation to be able to
[1:49:44] inherit your
[1:49:47] inheritance cuz the only way you'll get
[1:49:49] your inheritance is by the reveal
[1:49:52] word so then you see why did I preach so
[1:49:55] hard about Revelation and I preach so
[1:49:57] hard about the seals down your 70 weeks
[1:49:59] marriage and divorce whatever you want
[1:50:01] to
[1:50:02] cover to give you an
[1:50:05] opportunity to be able to
[1:50:08] say the word can build me into what I'm
[1:50:12] supposed to be
[1:50:14] right the word can make a child of God
[1:50:17] the word can bring a person to adoption
[1:50:20] but the reveal word is the only thing
[1:50:22] that
[1:50:23] will if you don't like that I'm sorry
[1:50:26] that's what brother Dale believes I
[1:50:28] believe that the revealing of the word
[1:50:29] will bring you up the statue of a
[1:50:31] perfect man cuz that's what I done I
[1:50:32] asked brother Mo when he preached it in
[1:50:34] 71 I said okay now you preached it I
[1:50:37] believe it he preached every one of
[1:50:39] those virtues and things to the letter
[1:50:41] and I believe it I still believe exactly
[1:50:42] what he preached about it but I said now
[1:50:45] how do I get
[1:50:48] him I want to know how to get
[1:50:51] right well it was about 1980 and the
[1:50:53] Lord spoke to him and said it's only by
[1:50:55] the revealing of the word and the
[1:50:57] virtues be brought in to a
[1:51:00] person do you know what I've been
[1:51:02] preaching ever since then try to preach
[1:51:05] enough
[1:51:07] word with the college
[1:51:10] where you can make
[1:51:15] it it's only by the revealed
[1:51:18] work that's the only thing that'll hold
[1:51:20] anybody the only thing that'll keep any
[1:51:22] of us is reveal word amen you can holler
[1:51:25] all you want to about seniority and how
[1:51:27] long you've been around that don't
[1:51:29] influence the devil none whatsoever
[1:51:31] that's
[1:51:33] right but what he can't stand is when
[1:51:36] that he beat you to
[1:51:38] death and yet you still love the
[1:51:42] word and you still love the god of the
[1:51:44] word go ahead read 369 the red
[1:51:48] book
