[26:48] just we're going to go to Genesis I mean
[26:50] the revelations one then we'll go to
[26:52] Genesis 1. and then to job 33. Lord
[26:56] Jesus we love you we thank you
[27:00] we just ask you to help us because
[27:02] without your help
[27:04] it would be a meaningless gathering this
[27:06] afternoon and a
[27:08] nothing worth anything but will you and
[27:11] your presence Among Us to speak to our
[27:13] hearts and our lives
[27:16] to just try to remind the people of the
[27:19] things that has been said in your word
[27:21] and brought to us by your Prophet we
[27:25] thank you for these things and we just
[27:26] cherish all of it and Lord after all of
[27:29] these years of studying and reading and
[27:32] how we still coming more to more to find
[27:35] the most positive things of the message
[27:38] that has been brought to us and Lord we
[27:41] love you we thank you remember the sick
[27:43] among us Lord remember the sin sick
[27:45] because there are some
[27:47] that has allowed things to enter into
[27:50] and get in their way and make sin come
[27:53] into the to doing we pray that you just
[27:55] touch that take it away because only you
[27:58] can do those things we love you and we
[28:01] thank you in Jesus name amen
[28:04] we'll start off with
[28:09] Revelations as it will skip over and get
[28:11] over to verse 12. and I turn to see the
[28:14] voice that Spate with me and being
[28:15] turned I saw seven golden candlesticks
[28:18] and in the midst of the seven
[28:19] candlesticks one likened to the son of
[28:21] man clothed with a garment down to the
[28:24] foot and gird about the pouch with a
[28:26] golden girdle now we're still on the
[28:28] topic of our thought has been now for uh
[28:33] I think this is message number 13. that
[28:36] we've been talking about the glory of
[28:39] his person and we still haven't got over
[28:42] into the the point with the bride as
[28:45] much we're still trying to stay back and
[28:48] get everything laid in a foundation to
[28:50] where we can understand you know and get
[28:53] it into the order all right
[28:55] Genesis 1 26 and God said let us make
[29:00] man in our image after our likeness and
[29:03] let them now notice
[29:05] them have dominion over the fish of the
[29:08] sea and over the fall of the air and
[29:10] over the cattle and over all the Earth
[29:13] and over ever creeping thing that
[29:15] creepeth upon the Earth so God created
[29:18] Man In His Image in the image of God
[29:20] created he him
[29:22] male and female created he them see a
[29:26] surprise to us is our thoughts a lot of
[29:28] times
[29:29] that it was only in the flesh man
[29:33] uh would you talk about
[29:36] you know Adam and Eve as being one
[29:39] you know
[29:40] and uh but you got a surprise
[29:44] she was in creation with him in the
[29:46] beginning are you done goofed up
[29:47] somewhere
[29:48] where'd she come from
[29:50] all right so whatever we see the image
[29:53] and whatever we see this creation that
[29:55] we talk about
[29:57] then remember Eve was a part of that
[30:01] and that's why that I've been so hard
[30:03] against all of these or them women ain't
[30:05] nothing but just don't byproducts
[30:08] and then I surely don't like the slang
[30:11] that to me is slanging I believe it can
[30:14] be Blasphemous to where the preachers
[30:16] will get up and say them all women ain't
[30:19] nothing but byproducts you're taking
[30:20] Walmart and they'll buy everything
[30:23] well they think that really makes a good
[30:24] something
[30:25] it does
[30:28] it makes stupidity into manifestation
[30:33] sorry
[30:35] that's just the way I think okay let's
[30:38] go to job 33 and 24.
[30:42] and he is gracious unto him
[30:45] and saith deliver him from going down to
[30:48] the pit I have found a ransom you may be
[30:52] seated the Lord
[30:54] and his Blessing to the reading of the
[30:56] word I know we won't get that far but we
[30:58] we're still driving
[31:00] you know to try to
[31:02] get a better understanding
[31:06] and I made the statement this morning
[31:07] and I I copied It Off
[31:10] to her that I had mentioned it
[31:13] you know we talk about there's no two
[31:15] forms of eternal life
[31:17] and then I wanted to give you these
[31:19] where you wouldn't uh think that I was
[31:21] just stating it actually one of them is
[31:24] our in our quotes today or the next week
[31:28] one
[31:29] but it's all for the message questions
[31:31] off of the message of Hebrews chapter 4.
[31:35] 57 901 brother Brandon said just think
[31:38] of it is there two Eternal lives
[31:42] you couldn't answer that could you
[31:45] there is one eternal life and that's the
[31:48] life of God
[31:49] this other kind of life no matter what
[31:52] it is it's got an end to it all right
[31:56] then he said it on questions and answers
[31:59] uh preaching 59 1223 there's only one
[32:03] form of eternal life and we're seeking
[32:05] for that and God alone has eternal life
[32:08] there's no two types of eternal life one
[32:14] eternal life and that's all that lives
[32:17] so think about these things you know
[32:20] there's no two Eternal lives there's
[32:21] only one eternal life
[32:22] well then you try to deal with this and
[32:24] deal with that you know
[32:26] you get it into trouble but no
[32:30] see to try to pick up the point this
[32:32] morning without backgrounding too far
[32:35] to where that we can look at it and we
[32:38] were trying to bring out then that you
[32:42] can see the uh in the creation you can
[32:45] see what the Creator is especially when
[32:48] you see that he is creating this man
[32:53] in His image
[32:55] you know and then his likeness uh
[32:59] brother Tony you know he don't never
[33:00] hardly ever say very much but sometimes
[33:03] you ought to sit down and listen to it
[33:05] you know
[33:06] when he speaks he generally speaks
[33:09] and uh he said you know said you take a
[33:12] seven inch tape player you know so that
[33:15] means real
[33:17] and said you transfer that over to an
[33:19] MP3
[33:21] he said you got the same thing
[33:25] it was on the seven inch reel
[33:27] over here on an MP3
[33:30] I said you're right
[33:32] you're right
[33:33] that's what I'm talking about all God
[33:35] was he poured into Christ and all Christ
[33:37] poured into the church that's that's
[33:39] where it's at that's what we're talking
[33:41] about the one true and living God is not
[33:45] being that you tear up the 17's real
[33:48] no it's still there
[33:50] as a matter of fact to Jeffersonville as
[33:53] far as I did years ago they used to
[33:55] still have all of the original seven
[33:57] inch reels you know that they still copy
[34:01] from that over on to the other things
[34:04] that was because they had the originals
[34:07] you know what they were doing no but
[34:10] think about it
[34:13] if we're created in the image of God
[34:17] then
[34:19] image means exact likeness
[34:23] and things and you could say well that
[34:26] really only means that we were created
[34:29] spiritual
[34:31] well
[34:33] that's good I believe that
[34:35] you know I believe God is a spirit I
[34:39] don't deny the scriptures or the
[34:41] thoughts I believe it you know I believe
[34:45] he's real and all but I I also know too
[34:49] that we found a lot more things as being
[34:52] unfolding down from to just say a spirit
[34:57] you know but I've told you over and over
[35:00] and I believe it I I don't believe that
[35:02] there was ever a time that he was just a
[35:04] spirit just floating around
[35:08] you know
[35:10] if something just and then he decides
[35:13] he's going to become tangibles
[35:17] that doesn't work with me because of one
[35:20] thing
[35:21] because it takes a lot of things to
[35:24] bring down and that's what I'm trying to
[35:26] speak about maybe it's a wrong word to
[35:28] say things or whatever but say forms
[35:32] it takes a lot of those forms to bring
[35:34] down the true understanding of God
[35:38] and you leave out any of it and you've
[35:41] left out a part of God
[35:43] you know
[35:44] because you're you're not keeping it in
[35:46] complete order but that way see then we
[35:49] the way that we're doing it talking
[35:51] about a man's a human being and we're
[35:53] not talking about this animal this is
[35:56] created in the image of animal
[35:59] now when we get to it we'll get on down
[36:02] to some more things probably not just
[36:05] today
[36:06] but remember that we were created in His
[36:09] image
[36:10] and that's spiritually speaking right
[36:14] all right
[36:15] but then we were created in the animal
[36:17] image
[36:19] physically speaking
[36:21] right all right
[36:22] now if you don't believe in the
[36:24] condescending of God what are you going
[36:26] to do with the fact of what we've got to
[36:28] deal with
[36:29] that
[36:32] he then would come in our image
[36:38] right
[36:40] you know he would come in our image he
[36:43] didn't come down looking like a martian
[36:46] that we think you know some kind of a
[36:47] weird looking animal stringy Tails or
[36:51] great big eyeballs and one in the middle
[36:54] and all the others you know
[36:56] he came down looking like a human being
[37:00] you know
[37:02] and you know what he cried like one
[37:04] you know when he was a baby like one
[37:07] you know he lived like one and you know
[37:09] he had to walk after the things of life
[37:12] well see then he come in our image to
[37:14] redeem us
[37:16] because that would be the only way that
[37:18] we could ever come back to that
[37:19] Redemption and that part that we read
[37:21] there in job where he said I found a
[37:24] ransom
[37:26] all right we'll get to that that deals
[37:29] with the soul of mankind
[37:32] and I say in this morning we we talk
[37:35] about this human body
[37:38] and we think it's so real until all
[37:40] we're pretty enough I got a spot right
[37:42] back there that my heart won't lay down
[37:44] and my wife she combs at every Sunday
[37:48] and she's got mad at me because I told
[37:51] her I said just I done combed it
[37:56] you know I mean to me take a scissors
[37:59] and cut it off I don't care it's back
[38:01] there I can't see that away
[38:03] you know and I don't it doesn't matter
[38:06] to me but
[38:09] you know
[38:10] we're human beings okay forget it oh
[38:15] but see to be created in the image of
[38:18] God
[38:22] and then God to come in our image is a
[38:24] wonderful thing
[38:26] it's really something great
[38:29] and you think about it that he would
[38:31] lower himself
[38:34] down to be one of us
[38:38] and I love the way the prophet explains
[38:40] that said he didn't send a son
[38:42] he didn't send another
[38:44] he said he came himself
[38:47] well no no I decided but he's still got
[38:50] to be up there
[38:52] you mean your God is so little until
[38:56] you think he's got some kind of a
[38:58] joystick that he's running this thing
[39:00] with this one keeps a moon rolling and
[39:03] that keeps the Sun going and that keeps
[39:05] this and he's got switches he's got to
[39:07] throw to keep the universe running and
[39:11] when he said let thy be amen
[39:13] amen that took care of it
[39:15] it'll run from now on until he decides
[39:18] what to do with it
[39:20] because he said let there be
[39:23] we're not playing with a little bitty
[39:24] silly koi ideas of mankind
[39:28] it was maybe a day when those things was
[39:30] all right because we had our own
[39:32] thoughts and our own ideas
[39:34] but the Bible says He commands all men
[39:37] to repent
[39:38] when the word comes through the lips or
[39:41] the prophet as we're saying this morning
[39:43] then we don't have any choice but to to
[39:46] stop and say okay
[39:48] there's no better way to explain it
[39:52] then that away
[39:55] well I if if if I'd been just if I'd
[39:58] have just been back there I could have
[40:00] explained it better
[40:04] forget it
[40:07] no
[40:10] when God said let there be light
[40:13] there was light
[40:16] that explained it
[40:18] you don't have to worry about it don't
[40:20] have to worry about where it come from I
[40:22] got a quote in here where brought around
[40:23] said where did he get that from or what
[40:25] did he do he said I don't know
[40:28] the Bible says something went to the
[40:30] order that the things we see were
[40:32] created by things of creative things
[40:34] that do not appear
[40:36] you know you can't find a place for it
[40:38] you can't decide what to do but think
[40:40] about it now let's get on and and maybe
[40:43] get into the thought
[40:46] that
[40:49] whatever image God was in
[40:52] that would be the image of
[40:55] the man
[40:57] that he would create
[40:59] all right and in creating that man
[41:04] it would bring into being all of the
[41:08] things that would ever happen
[41:11] none of this is by chance or Pro you
[41:14] know something uh he knew what it was
[41:17] going to be
[41:18] he knew if he created us we're going to
[41:21] go wrong
[41:22] he didn't have to get that figured out
[41:24] about the time he got down here and
[41:26] goofed up and said uh oh
[41:28] I messed up on making them
[41:31] you know
[41:33] but it did get pretty hard one time it
[41:35] said he repented
[41:37] you know that again
[41:39] he actually repented now I want to ask
[41:42] you the question who do you repent to
[41:44] you know but it does say that but see we
[41:49] take those things and try to calculate
[41:51] what it's all about it's statements to
[41:54] understand he might have said well but I
[41:58] do I I tell you what
[42:01] maybe I could have done it no other way
[42:03] but then he'd have to say nope
[42:05] couldn't be done no other way
[42:07] he knew all the things that was going to
[42:09] take place upon this Earth
[42:11] and he knew even to create Adam
[42:17] in His image
[42:21] and allow him to rule in the garden
[42:25] the animals
[42:28] me
[42:30] he still knew that that's that great one
[42:33] that was that away
[42:35] that placing down to bring everything
[42:38] into being
[42:40] that the man would mess up
[42:44] he knew that
[42:46] does that annihilate his great Superior
[42:50] thinking no it brings into manifestation
[42:54] the great understanding that he would
[42:56] have
[42:57] because I've got the notes are on some
[43:00] things my wife looks at Madison says my
[43:02] Lord you know because I'll have stacks
[43:04] of papers and run off and sitting here
[43:06] and here and here and and we'll get
[43:08] eventually maybe down to uh where were
[43:12] you when the morning star sang together
[43:13] and the sons of God shouted for Joy you
[43:15] know and all like that we've been
[43:17] through those things before but we'll
[43:18] try to tie him in as we go along and get
[43:22] into the great understandings of that
[43:24] doing and those things took place before
[43:27] the foundation of the world
[43:30] all right maybe we'll get to that
[43:32] thought in a minute but the main things
[43:34] I'm wanting you to think about
[43:37] is like we read this morning
[43:41] the first creation was God himself the
[43:44] prophet said
[43:46] they're on questions and answers on
[43:47] Genesis paragraph 21.
[43:50] but that doesn't mean that
[43:55] he was a you know created something
[43:59] that simply means that he is moving from
[44:04] not changing what he is
[44:08] I seem to think that that's what we
[44:10] think a lot of time that here he was and
[44:13] he changed
[44:15] to you know to try to develop something
[44:18] down here I don't believe that
[44:22] I believe he was that
[44:24] and now in our understanding we are
[44:27] having to change our understanding
[44:31] to line up with what he has said and
[44:35] what he is and what he's always been
[44:39] all right
[44:40] because if he knew
[44:43] that if he made us and we'd go wrong
[44:46] it's the same thing of knowing it would
[44:48] go wrong he knew what he would do
[44:53] he already had the answer before the
[44:56] question come into being you know
[44:58] and that's what we're trying to find see
[45:00] and find this man that he creates and
[45:04] he's not talking about when he says let
[45:06] us make man our own image and likeness
[45:08] he's not talking about it I keep saying
[45:10] this body thing that we are
[45:17] you you've got to stay in Genesis 1 26
[45:20] and 27 and on over into verse 28 to tie
[45:24] together but in Genesis 2 and 7 a man
[45:27] physically comes upon the Earth
[45:31] and that man then receives a name he
[45:33] didn't have a name
[45:36] until he comes into Adam
[45:39] you know flesh man
[45:42] he just says he created let's create man
[45:45] now we'll get to that more as we go
[45:47] along but
[45:50] you know maybe throw out a point and
[45:52] then get back to it later
[45:54] the ever person in the world
[45:58] has a soul
[46:01] all right
[46:03] in Ezekiel 18 4 he says All Souls are
[46:06] mine
[46:07] right
[46:10] and the prophet said All Souls were
[46:12] created before the world
[46:15] all right
[46:16] but he says he doesn't believe in
[46:18] pre-existence of Souls
[46:22] all right
[46:23] so now you've got to get it all tied
[46:25] together to understand that
[46:29] a lot of that was in his mind to come
[46:32] forth into a reality
[46:34] later on
[46:36] and Genesis 1 26 we'll read after a
[46:39] while is not just mankind created in His
[46:43] image
[46:46] I'm laying that out to start with
[46:49] it's not just all mankind it's not
[46:51] everybody
[46:52] a sinner can't fit in that category
[46:56] and hold together any point of thinking
[46:59] about 126 and 27.
[47:02] yeah
[47:04] he is in the image of God
[47:08] because he is a supernatural-like person
[47:12] to be the soul
[47:14] that's all right but he can't fit in 126
[47:17] and 27.
[47:20] now lay that out ahead of time to where
[47:22] you can think about it till we get back
[47:23] to it
[47:25] and just like I was saying then when
[47:28] Adam the spiritual man Adam as we call
[47:31] him when he was in the garden where was
[47:34] Eve
[47:41] did he create her later
[47:45] or was she in the original creation
[47:48] I got the quotes from The Prophet so I
[47:50] don't have to worry about it
[47:52] he said she was in the original creation
[47:54] and said she was in the original
[47:56] Creation in Adam fleshly speaking
[48:03] but everybody wants the woman a horse
[48:05] you're just a byproduct she wasn't an
[48:08] original
[48:09] oh they think he got a great revelation
[48:13] and the people just Rejoice look Eve
[48:16] wasn't in there look at that
[48:18] and women just reaching look at that she
[48:21] went in in the preacher up there just
[48:23] calling her a bunch of dog meat
[48:25] and she's rejoicing
[48:29] well I don't want to be called dog meat
[48:32] you know
[48:33] I might find a dog that's hungry
[48:36] I'd rather stay as I am
[48:39] but that's what we think about
[48:42] you know that brother random said that
[48:43] when Adam was created physically
[48:48] the reason he was lonely
[48:57] all right got you thinking that
[49:00] but around them said Eve was still in
[49:03] theophthy
[49:07] when Adam was already physically made
[49:13] that's why I loved prophet's message
[49:16] it's got the answers
[49:21] I have a lot of questions myself
[49:25] you know
[49:27] but I know a God that's got all the
[49:29] answers now he may not give them all to
[49:32] us here on Earth
[49:34] that's all right
[49:36] you know
[49:38] I mean you know me and my wife before we
[49:41] married we sat down and we talked about
[49:43] a lot of things about you know being
[49:46] husband and wife and
[49:48] she didn't know nothing about me until
[49:50] she married me about 20 years later
[49:53] it took her about that long to figure me
[49:55] out and she ain't got me figured out yet
[49:56] really
[49:57] but
[50:01] I guess that's just part of life
[50:06] it takes time to understand
[50:09] right all right
[50:11] Brother Ray sister Kathy is looking at
[50:14] you she ain't got you figured out yet
[50:16] either
[50:22] okay
[50:24] but talking about in Revelation the
[50:27] glory of his person
[50:30] this person this one
[50:33] that
[50:34] created all things
[50:38] but now here's where we're going to
[50:40] enter for a little bit because I want
[50:41] you to think about it and then we're
[50:42] going to read some more quotes relating
[50:44] to what we're talking about this morning
[50:47] see then Genesis 1 26 man
[50:53] is not just a creation of Souls
[50:57] of all mankind
[51:03] that's only one person
[51:10] you've heard that statement before but
[51:12] if you ever let it sink in
[51:14] the 126 man is just one person
[51:19] if you don't believe it that way I ask
[51:21] you a question
[51:22] then we'll run around and said that Adam
[51:25] was putting flesh he said he was still
[51:27] in theophany
[51:30] well you're trying to say then that Adam
[51:32] and Eve had the same soul
[51:40] in theophany
[51:42] because there's only one soul
[51:46] when you're speaking of theophany
[51:50] now when you're speaking of people
[51:53] there are many
[51:56] many Souls
[51:58] people
[52:01] that'll give you something to chew about
[52:03] all right
[52:04] we'll get down to those things
[52:07] but think about it
[52:09] we know for a surety that
[52:13] Jesus being almighty God
[52:16] and that he was the creator
[52:19] himself
[52:22] because you would go into trinitarianism
[52:24] if you have God to create Jesus as we'll
[52:26] read in a minute where he says it and
[52:29] then Jesus create everything else that's
[52:31] what basically most people think
[52:34] and uh
[52:36] but either he was
[52:38] God
[52:40] in another form
[52:43] called a son
[52:49] or you got a trinitarian Doctrine
[52:54] if you got two people
[52:58] you got a trinitarian Doctrine because
[52:59] there ain't no other place to put them
[53:03] but if you got one person as we read not
[53:06] the first person
[53:07] but the person
[53:09] we quoted this morning out of the
[53:11] unveiling of God
[53:13] if you can see that then you can hold a
[53:15] point to where that when you watch
[53:18] eternal life
[53:20] then I have no problems whatsoever with
[53:23] the statements brother random said
[53:26] you always was eternal
[53:31] boy that strobe haywire and the message
[53:34] people of all kind of realms
[53:38] but it's very simple
[53:40] check the message he said if you have
[53:44] eternal life
[53:46] you always was eternal
[53:48] what eternal life always was eternal
[53:51] that's no problem is it like in the
[53:53] scripture where it says his seed
[53:55] remaineth in you then you cannot sin
[53:59] yet the scripture says we sin every day
[54:03] now see
[54:06] it all ties together we get it in the
[54:09] right place
[54:10] but if not then we we run Haywire with
[54:13] it and we we read a lot this morning
[54:16] especially there from questions and
[54:18] answers in Genesis
[54:19] to where he was speaking about
[54:22] how that God was the first creation and
[54:25] then out of that came the logos and
[54:27] logos down to the man and he created
[54:29] that man but remember the man he's
[54:31] speaking of there is a 126 man
[54:37] because
[54:39] then you put it into flesh at a later
[54:42] time in 2-7
[54:45] and Eve is still left over here
[54:49] and Adam is down here
[54:55] but that's only Eve's theophany because
[54:58] her body's down here
[55:02] right
[55:04] then God removes that from
[55:08] Adam that we talk about the rib to make
[55:11] a body
[55:13] and he puts that
[55:15] theophany in that body
[55:23] me
[55:26] got a lot to talk about haven't we
[55:28] may be in the Millennium will
[55:31] comprehend a lot of things
[55:34] but let's stay with this reading a
[55:36] little bit as the prophet
[55:38] trying to express it unto us
[55:42] and maybe these words will not be so odd
[55:46] as we go along so go ahead brother and
[55:48] let's pick up number four
[55:50] there of
[55:52] the message
[55:54] where it's a message called who is God
[55:56] and that's really a great message
[55:58] to get into and study it because it's
[56:01] basically questions and answers on
[56:03] Genesis with you know
[56:05] basic same route mine wouldn't play too
[56:09] good so I couldn't use it
[56:11] but I got a lot of quotes off of it
[56:14] so he goes to e16 so he first was god
[56:18] Jehovah and out of him let's just
[56:20] picture now as a little drama so you can
[56:23] get it let's see coming out of space
[56:25] where there's nothing let's make it a
[56:27] little white light like a Mystic light
[56:29] like a Halo and that was the logos that
[56:32] went out of God in the beginning that
[56:34] was the son of God that came out of the
[56:36] bosom of the father remember the
[56:38] scripture said
[56:39] no man is saying guarded in it but the
[56:42] bosom the sun has declared it
[56:46] out of the bosom
[56:48] see the sun declares you know it's not
[56:50] another person that was what was in the
[56:53] beginning was the word now I want you to
[56:55] take on that right there
[56:58] that was the son of God that came out of
[57:00] the bosom with the father
[57:03] they said we want to take John 1 and
[57:05] break it in Genesis 1.
[57:10] right
[57:11] where it says and God created heaven and
[57:13] earth
[57:14] now the word was on back
[57:17] before all of that
[57:20] all right
[57:22] look what he says
[57:26] came out of the Muslim that was what was
[57:30] the beginning was the word
[57:37] what
[57:39] when the sun came out of the bosom with
[57:41] the father
[57:43] that was what was in the beginning was
[57:46] the word
[57:48] you remember we argued that when we were
[57:51] trinitarians
[57:54] in the beginning was the word word was
[57:56] with God
[57:58] well we had two of them at least
[58:02] and then somebody said but the next part
[58:04] of it said and the Word was God oh we're
[58:08] back down to one again
[58:11] but brother random takes it before the
[58:13] foundation of the world
[58:18] that was that was in the beginning was
[58:21] the word and the Word was with God and
[58:24] the Word was God and the Word was made
[58:26] flesh and dwelt Among Us in the
[58:28] beginning was God then out of God came
[58:30] to logos a part of God that went out of
[58:33] God raise it on up going back into a
[58:36] little picture of drama
[58:38] now see this is just like a child
[58:40] playing before the door
[58:42] it was the son of God
[58:45] below gosh
[58:46] and I can see him out there and he spake
[58:49] and said let there be light
[58:51] and there was nothing but there was
[58:53] something happened and an atom burst
[58:57] and Adam Turner excuse diary and begin
[59:00] to whirl around this away the sun began
[59:03] to come into existence because he said
[59:05] let there be
[59:06] there's the authority where did he get
[59:09] it to to make it from I don't know there
[59:13] was nothing to make it from but he
[59:15] believed his own word
[59:18] you know he believed his own word and he
[59:21] said and there was light all right
[59:24] let there be
[59:30] who said that
[59:34] now according to the Bible and according
[59:36] to our understanding Jesus Christ is the
[59:39] creator of all things
[59:42] not Jesus the flesh
[59:45] no no
[59:47] Jesus the Christ
[59:49] amen well then Jesus of Christ must be
[59:51] God
[59:53] or else you have a trinitarian concept
[59:57] me
[59:59] so you got to realize and see then that
[1:00:01] you're not talking about when the sun
[1:00:03] came out that that's another person
[1:00:05] comes up here's this person is like
[1:00:07] brother Tony said you got every bit of
[1:00:10] this coming down over here
[1:00:13] you know
[1:00:15] you got every bit it was back there it
[1:00:18] just comes over here
[1:00:22] and then now we're just seeing it
[1:00:24] develop
[1:00:26] into something that we can comprehend
[1:00:29] all right
[1:00:31] we'd like a child before the father's
[1:00:33] door he says
[1:00:39] what greater terminology could that be
[1:00:45] because Church whether you believe in or
[1:00:47] listen to it or think about it
[1:00:49] you're Oneness people have a lot more
[1:00:52] truth in the quoting of the scriptures
[1:00:54] than your trinitarian concept
[1:00:58] but yet it can't be the one that's
[1:01:00] Doctrine
[1:01:04] and by not being able to be the one
[1:01:06] that's Doctrine you've got to keep
[1:01:08] Father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:01:11] to have your one God
[1:01:17] do you take away any part of that
[1:01:19] and what have you done
[1:01:24] then there's no problem then with
[1:01:27] the baptism and Jesus standing here and
[1:01:30] here comes a dove floating down and
[1:01:32] here's the voice and speaking up here
[1:01:36] there's no problem then with Jesus
[1:01:39] speaking to his father are praying
[1:01:42] I'm saying glorify me with the glory
[1:01:44] that we had before the foundation of the
[1:01:46] world
[1:01:50] because he's not a trinitarian
[1:01:53] but he's not just a Oneness over here
[1:01:55] come on over here and let's come on over
[1:01:57] here
[1:01:59] you have to keep it to where you can
[1:02:01] keep that being because if not then who
[1:02:04] do you pray to as I was talking about
[1:02:07] this morning
[1:02:08] why do you pray out loud
[1:02:13] you got God in you
[1:02:20] and don't worry about it God can hear
[1:02:21] your thoughts remember our thoughts are
[1:02:24] louder in heaven than our words are on
[1:02:26] Earth
[1:02:27] but that still doesn't do away without
[1:02:29] with us praying does it
[1:02:33] because what is prayer
[1:02:35] it's a communication
[1:02:39] right
[1:02:43] he starts pouring out our heart
[1:02:46] even Jesus prayed in the garden
[1:02:48] until his blood became his blood sweat
[1:02:51] became his blood
[1:02:53] agony
[1:02:55] praying
[1:02:58] right
[1:03:00] see we want to get it all in a lump sum
[1:03:04] and then we say that's too deep
[1:03:08] no it's too simple
[1:03:11] there is nothing in God deep
[1:03:14] that's the problem we make it deep
[1:03:18] it's too simple to understand
[1:03:23] like I've always said you know you're
[1:03:25] talking about The Stumbling Stone a rock
[1:03:27] of offense
[1:03:30] and you get out on a football field and
[1:03:32] and you standing in the middle and you
[1:03:34] got that 100 yards by what how wide 50
[1:03:37] 60 yards wide or something and there's
[1:03:39] nothing out there but a half inch grass
[1:03:42] and you're out there looking for a rock
[1:03:44] you're just trying to find one
[1:03:47] and you walk along you stumble and fall
[1:03:49] down
[1:03:50] then what was that oh that's the Rock
[1:03:55] see that's how our stupidity goes
[1:03:59] that we're doing it but see it's a lot
[1:04:01] Rock of offense
[1:04:03] that stumble
[1:04:05] at the word
[1:04:08] this Prophet brought things so simple
[1:04:13] until it's amazing
[1:04:15] how simple
[1:04:18] had he been a theologian
[1:04:20] logical words and terms none of us would
[1:04:23] have been able to follow it
[1:04:25] yet he brought it down in and had to use
[1:04:28] their words of logos theophany you know
[1:04:31] this that or the other
[1:04:33] but as he did
[1:04:36] it was brought into simple terminologies
[1:04:39] that you and I could understand
[1:04:44] was he just making like a little Halo of
[1:04:46] light
[1:04:50] a little Halo of light just goes out
[1:04:53] that was the sun see when we look at it
[1:04:56] like trying to find a son we say well
[1:04:59] see in our minds a lot well the sun went
[1:05:01] out of the father and here goes here
[1:05:03] stands a person over here
[1:05:05] person over here it's not that way
[1:05:10] he just took a form
[1:05:12] stepped over into it and said let there
[1:05:14] be
[1:05:22] think about it Church
[1:05:26] God
[1:05:28] trying to condescend
[1:05:31] to mankind
[1:05:33] descending that we could comprehend him
[1:05:40] right
[1:05:42] and as he does he does starts and he
[1:05:44] uses forms he uses words
[1:05:47] and things
[1:05:50] and he's like a child run around and
[1:05:51] said on the pillar of fire like a child
[1:05:54] playing before the father's door
[1:05:59] well then was he a little bitty baby
[1:06:02] was this one that created a little bitty
[1:06:04] baby he was like a child
[1:06:10] what does he simply saying
[1:06:15] degrade eternal
[1:06:19] could remain
[1:06:21] as great and honorable and thoughtful as
[1:06:24] to what he is and yet not a part of him
[1:06:27] going out
[1:06:29] is we try to make it look like
[1:06:33] but just that he changes a form to
[1:06:36] reveal himself
[1:06:37] and not a little bitty baby playing
[1:06:39] before the father's door
[1:06:44] because you'll hear Brother Branham then
[1:06:45] he's saying says then he has in his mind
[1:06:50] what he's going to create
[1:06:53] and he says let there be
[1:06:58] and so things begin to appear
[1:07:01] a little baby no
[1:07:04] I really enjoyed it one time when we
[1:07:06] were down at the Atlanta third The
[1:07:08] Passion Play and the only time they ever
[1:07:11] done it because they said it was
[1:07:12] copyrighted they couldn't use it for one
[1:07:13] time
[1:07:15] but it had a part of a scene and then
[1:07:17] it you know if you remember those things
[1:07:19] that would start with a certain scene at
[1:07:21] different ones and they had a part of a
[1:07:23] scene and then all at once
[1:07:25] they had like there was nothing
[1:07:28] and it's a good way of doing it they
[1:07:30] kept pulling these things back and
[1:07:31] forming rocks and doing things because
[1:07:34] there was a voice saying let there be
[1:07:39] well just for a minute it viewed that
[1:07:43] person
[1:07:44] just for a minute
[1:07:48] the next scene was transforming
[1:07:51] 4 000 years you know over
[1:07:54] and a baby crying in a cradle
[1:07:58] and then it comes up from that to a
[1:07:59] grown man all right just trying to
[1:08:02] illustrate something
[1:08:05] that grown man was the same man that had
[1:08:09] stood back there and said let there be
[1:08:13] that's what he looked like darn is what
[1:08:15] he looked down here
[1:08:17] can't you see then that's the way God is
[1:08:24] he's simply trying to reveal himself to
[1:08:26] you and I
[1:08:27] as the great Eternal God
[1:08:31] that has covered all space-time and
[1:08:34] Eternity as the prophet would say it and
[1:08:37] letting us understand
[1:08:40] how he would come into being
[1:08:46] right and if he did then
[1:08:50] as I said it wouldn't be then that we
[1:08:52] would think about
[1:08:53] God over here and then Jesus comes over
[1:08:56] here
[1:08:57] either Jesus was God let me quote the
[1:09:00] prophet either Jesus was God or the
[1:09:03] greatest Deceiver
[1:09:05] the world has ever known
[1:09:09] it's his words
[1:09:11] that he was either God or the greatest
[1:09:13] Deceiver
[1:09:16] but when he said I and my father are one
[1:09:21] he said Philip have I been so long with
[1:09:24] you
[1:09:26] have you seen me you've seen the father
[1:09:30] you know
[1:09:32] so what does the father look like
[1:09:43] must look like what we're standing there
[1:09:46] you know because that's what he was
[1:09:49] right now if he came himself
[1:09:53] then we're right
[1:09:55] in the truth of understanding and we're
[1:09:57] not Oneness
[1:09:59] he came himself but the way he came
[1:10:03] would make it to her that he doesn't
[1:10:06] have to do away with this form to come
[1:10:09] into this form
[1:10:15] all of those attributes all those things
[1:10:17] were still in God
[1:10:22] but see we can't didn't turn around and
[1:10:24] do like the prophet said go ahead with
[1:10:25] number six the word you've read this
[1:10:27] before and we did the other day but it's
[1:10:29] taken from 336 of the lady you see in
[1:10:32] church hey our church age book
[1:10:34] or the beginning of the creation of God
[1:10:37] that is what that is who the Lord Jesus
[1:10:39] says he is but those words don't mean
[1:10:42] exactly as they sound to us
[1:10:44] just taking them the way they sound has
[1:10:46] made some people in fact multitudes of
[1:10:48] people get the idea that Jesus was the
[1:10:51] first creation of God making him lower
[1:10:54] than godhead than this first creation
[1:10:56] created all the rest of the universe and
[1:10:59] whatsoever it contained but that is not
[1:11:02] right you know that doesn't line up with
[1:11:04] the rest of the Bible the words are he's
[1:11:07] the beginner or author
[1:11:09] of the creation of God now we know now
[1:11:13] we know for a surety that Jesus is God
[1:11:17] very God he's a Creator their next Parts
[1:11:20] below there he said he's the Genesis one
[1:11:23] Genesis 1 1 you know and then he brings
[1:11:26] it down to
[1:11:28] um
[1:11:29] in uh numbers I believe it is where he
[1:11:33] said in six days he created
[1:11:35] and he brings it right on down to seeing
[1:11:38] who that is
[1:11:39] but do we believe it
[1:11:43] now we're back to that old saying that
[1:11:45] people likes
[1:11:48] do we really need to understand this
[1:11:53] you know
[1:11:55] do we really need to understand God
[1:12:00] my brother said it like this he said
[1:12:03] we had talked about some things and he
[1:12:06] said
[1:12:08] well you know what it don't matter as
[1:12:09] long as I get to heaven
[1:12:14] well I thought about the quote that the
[1:12:16] prophet made when he said that most
[1:12:19] people just want to miss hell
[1:12:23] is the reason they want to serve God
[1:12:26] they just want to miss going to hell
[1:12:29] all right
[1:12:30] but you see you say well what does it
[1:12:32] matter
[1:12:37] it matters so much until I wish you
[1:12:40] would remember that the things that I'm
[1:12:42] reading and inviting you to read and
[1:12:44] study is what your Prophet spent 30
[1:12:48] something years bringing
[1:12:53] right but it wasn't important
[1:12:55] we don't need to understand that
[1:12:58] he spent his entire life
[1:13:05] trying to preach to us
[1:13:12] about this God that we claim
[1:13:16] well we don't need to know about that
[1:13:19] well what do we need
[1:13:22] we just need salvation
[1:13:26] that's what I'm trying to preach
[1:13:29] because if it wasn't salvation I was
[1:13:32] trying to preach
[1:13:33] then then we would just all go home and
[1:13:36] be happy about being that God created us
[1:13:39] in His image
[1:13:41] if he created us in His image then he
[1:13:43] ain't going to destroy us so we're all
[1:13:44] going to heaven
[1:13:49] no
[1:13:50] because you see the man that he created
[1:13:55] whoever you want to blame father Creed
[1:13:58] the Fall
[1:13:59] just still remember the man fell
[1:14:07] right
[1:14:09] you know that put us on the other side
[1:14:11] away from God Amen
[1:14:14] the Great Gulf is fixed between us
[1:14:18] if there's only one can bridge that Gap
[1:14:20] to bring it back
[1:14:22] and that would be God hath to come
[1:14:24] himself
[1:14:27] and that's what I'm talking about
[1:14:29] the coming of God
[1:14:33] coming into view coming into
[1:14:35] understanding
[1:14:37] to you and I
[1:14:41] and to believe that he's real not to
[1:14:43] just well he's just see that's what most
[1:14:45] people think that's what I used to think
[1:14:47] I know what you think
[1:14:49] maybe not as bad as I do but I know what
[1:14:52] you think
[1:14:53] but we used to think well he's just a
[1:14:55] spirit or something he's just some kind
[1:14:57] of something and all at once that's some
[1:14:59] kind of something said well I'll send
[1:15:01] down my son
[1:15:03] and I'll let him die so he
[1:15:06] sins of Flesh
[1:15:08] and like they're saying in the message
[1:15:09] today that God didn't die
[1:15:14] you know
[1:15:15] that
[1:15:19] that wasn't God he just was a man and
[1:15:22] then God came on him
[1:15:24] and then God left him and he died a man
[1:15:36] the best you can deal with
[1:15:39] in that is
[1:15:41] to think about
[1:15:45] if it was just a man then we're still in
[1:15:47] our sins
[1:15:50] unless that man was God
[1:15:56] but around said no man can die that away
[1:16:00] the way he died
[1:16:03] he said then it had to be God well my
[1:16:06] God
[1:16:08] my god oh Glory
[1:16:12] as your Prophet said he died
[1:16:17] oh I know a little bit too I know it's
[1:16:20] on the unveiling of God where he said he
[1:16:23] acted as either that or gone and the
[1:16:25] unveiling of God or
[1:16:29] it's one of those about the unveiling
[1:16:31] that goes on over that
[1:16:33] that run around and says this way he
[1:16:35] said he acted the part of death
[1:16:39] well art that's true
[1:16:42] but see that's where you don't see him
[1:16:44] as being real
[1:16:50] where do we get down to it when we get
[1:16:52] to dealing with that body spirit and
[1:16:53] soul
[1:16:57] you know there was a man walked on the
[1:16:59] shores of Galilee that claimed to be God
[1:17:05] and you know he had a body had a spirit
[1:17:07] he had a soul
[1:17:08] and you know that body of his
[1:17:11] could be tempted
[1:17:17] well says in all points that we are
[1:17:22] then you gotta
[1:17:24] well get off of it and go on brother
[1:17:27] Dave
[1:17:28] because it's got to be revealed
[1:17:32] all right this man
[1:17:35] that was created in Genesis not talking
[1:17:37] about the two seven now
[1:17:39] follow me I'm talking about that talking
[1:17:42] about the 126 and 27 man the spiritual
[1:17:46] man
[1:17:47] all right
[1:17:49] this man was created and the prophet
[1:17:52] said
[1:17:53] that he was in the image of God the
[1:17:55] Bible says he was in the image of God
[1:17:59] the prophet said he led the animals as
[1:18:01] the Holy Spirit leads us today
[1:18:07] and said that he was
[1:18:09] then a theophany man
[1:18:14] we go Haywire trying to figure that out
[1:18:17] because we can read
[1:18:19] and we read over in the Corinthians
[1:18:24] back up a minute
[1:18:25] where it talks about that we have this
[1:18:28] body waiting
[1:18:32] but I want to ask you a simple question
[1:18:38] it says there that that body is waiting
[1:18:42] eternal
[1:18:43] in the heavens
[1:18:53] do you have eternal life
[1:18:59] do you
[1:19:01] I'm asking you you know you could at
[1:19:04] least answer yes okay
[1:19:07] if you have the new birth you have
[1:19:09] eternal life right now I didn't mean for
[1:19:12] this to come out that way it's just a
[1:19:15] good way of it coming out
[1:19:16] but remember there is no two Eternal
[1:19:20] lies
[1:19:24] is that what we read
[1:19:26] to start with there is no two Eternal
[1:19:29] lives
[1:19:32] so then if you got eternal life and yet
[1:19:35] eternal life is up in heaven this you
[1:19:40] something wrong there
[1:19:43] sounds wrong
[1:19:45] I know the quotes from the prophet he
[1:19:47] said already there agreed
[1:19:53] I agree with that
[1:19:58] but I agree with where there's not no
[1:20:00] two Eternal lives
[1:20:03] and see I happen to be one of the old
[1:20:05] schools that believes that you've got to
[1:20:08] be born again to have eternal life I
[1:20:10] mean I'm sorry that's just the way I
[1:20:12] believe it I believe that you didn't
[1:20:14] come into the world with eternal life
[1:20:16] we'll get to Adam and blasphemous names
[1:20:19] if you want to read some there go with
[1:20:21] that I know that brother Branham and
[1:20:23] what he taught
[1:20:25] not all of it but I know enough to
[1:20:28] say a few things
[1:20:30] I know that that man Adam that was in
[1:20:33] the garden
[1:20:35] wrote around and said especially upon
[1:20:37] Adam eternal life
[1:20:40] well
[1:20:41] that simply must mean that there was
[1:20:44] somewhere that man that was standing
[1:20:45] there
[1:20:46] the two seven man didn't have eternal
[1:20:48] life because the Bible said in God
[1:20:50] breathed into his nostrils then he
[1:20:52] become a living soul
[1:20:54] but I also know that he breathes breath
[1:20:57] into the nostrils of every baby that
[1:21:00] comes into the world because that has to
[1:21:02] come from God
[1:21:04] right
[1:21:05] but I also know that that was a the only
[1:21:08] time he done it was in Adam
[1:21:13] the rest of mankind didn't get eternal
[1:21:16] life because you'd have an eternal
[1:21:17] sinner
[1:21:20] then the next baby that came with
[1:21:22] eternal life was Jesus Christ
[1:21:25] hey
[1:21:26] all right
[1:21:28] it would come out to be correct
[1:21:31] so let's think about this man that we're
[1:21:33] talking about go over number seven
[1:21:35] let's read a little bit
[1:21:39] brother random we've read this over and
[1:21:40] over
[1:21:41] as a matter of fact this is the one
[1:21:43] that's got to quote up above it about
[1:21:45] the eternal life
[1:21:47] paragraph 230 he said was God a man
[1:21:50] certainly
[1:21:51] let us make man in our own image
[1:21:54] what was God a theophany a body
[1:21:58] and there was no man like that excuse me
[1:22:01] and there was excuse me let me just get
[1:22:04] the reading right and our man was made
[1:22:07] like that and put Over the Garden but
[1:22:10] there was no man to till the soil in the
[1:22:12] senses then he created man Out of the
[1:22:15] Dust of the Earth in the animal life and
[1:22:18] that man till the soil
[1:22:20] and the man fell by transgression
[1:22:22] correctly and God the theophany come
[1:22:25] down and was made flesh and dwelt among
[1:22:27] us to redeem the man
[1:22:31] Simple Plan of Redemption
[1:22:33] all right
[1:22:35] so then God was the theophany so he made
[1:22:37] demand the theophany right
[1:22:39] go ahead to the next one which is number
[1:22:41] eight
[1:22:42] the darkest hour then Jesus comes along
[1:22:46] paragraph e25
[1:22:49] she's talking about he pulled him and
[1:22:51] talking of of G of Mary
[1:22:54] uh or Napoleon from Jesus the lady at
[1:22:57] the whale I think but listen she pulled
[1:22:59] from him virtue through that human body
[1:23:01] of his God he was just a man
[1:23:04] we'll see how brother Dale he's just a
[1:23:06] man
[1:23:08] look
[1:23:09] mourned of a woman
[1:23:12] but his father was God
[1:23:16] but in his body
[1:23:18] he was a man
[1:23:20] okay that's right look in his spirit
[1:23:25] he was God
[1:23:28] foreign
[1:23:32] his body
[1:23:34] the creation Hebrews 10 5 right
[1:23:37] into the wound of Mary coming forward
[1:23:39] but his Spirit was almighty God
[1:23:44] we're talking about this man over here
[1:23:46] now
[1:23:47] bringing him down to try to help us we
[1:23:49] ain't got back there with a man of Adam
[1:23:51] yet just hold on all right look at the
[1:23:53] next one
[1:23:55] you remember there in body he was a man
[1:23:58] in his Spirit he was God
[1:24:00] he goes to the God keeps his word
[1:24:03] paragraph 76 I believe that Jesus is the
[1:24:07] son of God
[1:24:08] I believe that in body he was a man
[1:24:11] he was born of a woman just like I was
[1:24:13] now
[1:24:14] now we know that ain't right
[1:24:17] to say that he was born sinful and
[1:24:20] brought about by sex
[1:24:22] right
[1:24:23] so we're not talking about that
[1:24:27] he's talking about he come from a mother
[1:24:29] he comes through the wound
[1:24:32] get it right
[1:24:34] because he said what
[1:24:36] but his blood was not of a woman
[1:24:38] it was of God and Jehovah God the logos
[1:24:41] who brewed over the Earth in my messages
[1:24:44] this morning
[1:24:46] and brewed the first man Out of the Dust
[1:24:49] of the earth
[1:24:50] overshattering Mary and brood over her
[1:24:52] to fulfill his word and created the
[1:24:55] blood cell that brought forth the son of
[1:24:57] the Living God I believe in body he was
[1:24:59] a man I believe in his soul he was God
[1:25:04] he was God's manifestation here on Earth
[1:25:07] God was in Christ reconciling him the
[1:25:10] world to himself I believe that he was
[1:25:13] not just a mere man neither was he a
[1:25:16] prophet he was God Emmanuel
[1:25:19] I believe that with all of my heart
[1:25:21] what
[1:25:23] who he is
[1:25:25] twin body
[1:25:27] it was a creation which was the blood of
[1:25:29] God
[1:25:31] right no DNA connection to the human
[1:25:34] race
[1:25:36] nah come on you could have run his blood
[1:25:38] and it was red
[1:25:40] you could have run it it may have had a
[1:25:41] top
[1:25:44] but get what the point is it's the blood
[1:25:46] of God
[1:25:49] it was a created blood
[1:25:52] not a human element brought by mankind
[1:25:57] and definitely we know it's not the
[1:25:59] Virgin Mary that produced The Egg and
[1:26:01] God supplied the sperm Etc you know nah
[1:26:04] we don't go with them things either
[1:26:06] we go with the truth
[1:26:08] see
[1:26:09] but what about now in body he's a man in
[1:26:12] spirit he's God in body he's a man in
[1:26:16] Soul he was God
[1:26:20] then when that man was born there
[1:26:22] brought into this world
[1:26:28] he was Body Spirit and soul
[1:26:36] look at the next and works its Faith
[1:26:38] expressed
[1:26:42] now remember you're in a cycle of three
[1:26:46] but you're one person
[1:26:48] like Father Son and Holy Ghost cycle of
[1:26:51] three the one person
[1:26:53] three attributes of the same God
[1:26:55] fatherhood three offices like fatherhood
[1:26:59] sonship and Holy Ghost
[1:27:00] and you are Body Spirit and soul
[1:27:04] now
[1:27:07] for a part of us being here if we're
[1:27:10] Body Spirit and soul and God comes in
[1:27:12] our image what is he
[1:27:16] right so body Hebrews 10 5. which was a
[1:27:21] creation of God's word
[1:27:23] spirit
[1:27:25] and soul
[1:27:27] not just some man
[1:27:34] right
[1:27:36] the soul and the spirit was God
[1:27:40] the flesh was a creation
[1:27:43] see the outside body has five inlets to
[1:27:46] it to contact your Earthly homes he
[1:27:49] taste feels about here the inside which
[1:27:51] is the spirit it has five senses
[1:27:53] conscious and love and so forth but the
[1:27:55] inside of that the soul as one thing
[1:27:58] that's where you live
[1:28:01] now if we are body I want to take this
[1:28:04] for a minute and then we'll quit if we
[1:28:06] are as a human being a body a spirit and
[1:28:09] a soul
[1:28:12] right
[1:28:13] all right then if God came in our image
[1:28:20] then he's Body Spirit and soul
[1:28:26] right
[1:28:29] and what happened
[1:28:32] yeah but my God can't die
[1:28:35] God never the what we talk about God or
[1:28:40] he can't die
[1:28:43] that's fine
[1:28:45] my God can't die no God can't die but he
[1:28:49] went to the part of what we call death
[1:28:52] he acted that part according to the
[1:28:54] unveiling of God or either the Mighty
[1:28:56] God unveiled before us that's the other
[1:28:58] one I was trying to get one ago
[1:28:59] one of those two he said he acted the
[1:29:01] part of death
[1:29:04] now here's quotes that we'll get to if
[1:29:07] you need them but right around said God
[1:29:10] tore that soul
[1:29:12] out of that body
[1:29:18] that looks like he just got so mad at
[1:29:20] him or whatever he just
[1:29:23] no no no no no
[1:29:27] simple sense
[1:29:29] what happened to that man
[1:29:34] that we call Jesus
[1:29:38] on the cross he was hanging there he was
[1:29:42] back in the garden showing you who he is
[1:29:43] he was back in the garden he said
[1:29:46] or not in the garden he was coming up
[1:29:48] when it comes with a quotation over
[1:29:50] there something else in a minute he said
[1:29:53] now it's my soul troubled
[1:29:56] but for this reason in other words
[1:30:00] he said his soul was troubled
[1:30:03] so he had a soul
[1:30:06] he said into thy hands I commend my
[1:30:08] spirit
[1:30:10] so there's a spirit there
[1:30:14] but don't just make him just any kind of
[1:30:16] a spirit
[1:30:19] because we'll show where the Prophet
[1:30:21] when we get back to it where he talks
[1:30:23] about that this spirit that was in him
[1:30:25] was the spirit that spoke through
[1:30:29] the prophets
[1:30:32] so it's not just an ordinary spirit and
[1:30:34] a man and in a soul that happened to be
[1:30:36] something
[1:30:42] no the body was a creation
[1:30:46] all you got to do I can't kill you you
[1:30:49] can't kill nothing we haven't been
[1:30:50] through that
[1:30:52] but when that soul and that Spirit
[1:30:54] stepped out of that body
[1:30:59] you got the quotes where the Prophet
[1:31:00] said it
[1:31:02] he said his Spirit went back to God who
[1:31:04] gave it
[1:31:06] he said his soul went to hell
[1:31:09] to preach
[1:31:10] to this old in prison
[1:31:13] he said that he was born out from
[1:31:14] Resurrection
[1:31:16] for three days
[1:31:18] because the word said it
[1:31:21] huh he said then when that time was done
[1:31:24] said his Spirit was released
[1:31:28] went to his soul and his soul to his
[1:31:31] body and said he stood in the
[1:31:33] resurrection
[1:31:36] he said that's what happens to you amen
[1:31:39] amen he said when you die your spirit
[1:31:41] goes to God who gave it says your soul
[1:31:44] goes under the altar where I saw those
[1:31:47] the other day
[1:31:50] yeah
[1:31:53] and he said your body goes to the Grave
[1:31:55] and said one day
[1:31:57] said that spirit will be released when
[1:31:59] the
[1:32:00] things are fulfilled it'll go to that
[1:32:02] soul and that soul to that body and he
[1:32:04] said you'll stand upon the Earth
[1:32:08] right
[1:32:10] well we believe that there's somebody
[1:32:12] going to be standing here right because
[1:32:14] of the scriptures and the prophet's word
[1:32:16] that don't have to go to that grave
[1:32:22] but around him says we take this body
[1:32:26] to meet the theophany
[1:32:28] what's up yonder
[1:32:33] folks
[1:32:36] this right here is taking you
[1:32:40] to your theophany
[1:32:42] the fullness of God you say well what
[1:32:44] about the word it says about the
[1:32:47] you know the the uh
[1:32:51] we have a body waiting read the
[1:32:54] scripture
[1:32:55] it says
[1:32:57] if this Earthly Tabernacle
[1:33:02] were which is two questions it's done
[1:33:05] been asked dissolved
[1:33:07] we have one waiting
[1:33:10] are you there now
[1:33:14] who is this Melchizedek you'll find an
[1:33:16] outstanding statement the prophet is
[1:33:18] talking about the theophany and he said
[1:33:19] we don't have that body yet
[1:33:23] he's already taught you your theophan is
[1:33:25] your soul
[1:33:29] he said we bypassed
[1:33:31] our theophany
[1:33:34] to come to flesh
[1:33:36] so there must be a little bit more about
[1:33:37] this that we need understanding we'll
[1:33:40] hold to that
[1:33:42] but I had a bunch of quotes there to
[1:33:44] show you what it was and let me just
[1:33:46] read that and then we'll quit come ahead
[1:33:47] Brothers I can read while y'all are
[1:33:49] getting up here
[1:33:50] I hope I got him in here
[1:33:57] come ahead musicians
[1:34:01] well we got the communion now that's
[1:34:03] right just hold it hold it we got the
[1:34:05] communion you can let up your screen
[1:34:07] okay in job
[1:34:10] 33 24 we read
[1:34:13] I have found a ransom
[1:34:18] in Exodus 30 and 12 is talking about the
[1:34:21] sum of the children of Israel after
[1:34:22] their number and they shall give Every
[1:34:25] Man a ransom for his soul and to the
[1:34:28] Lord
[1:34:32] they even knew a lot about it to her
[1:34:34] Psalms 40 and 9 verse 7.
[1:34:38] none of them can by any means redeem his
[1:34:42] brother
[1:34:43] nor give to God a ransom for him so we
[1:34:47] can't do it gonna be a kin folks right
[1:34:50] Matthew 20 and 28.
[1:34:53] even as the son of man came not to be
[1:34:56] ministered unto but to minister and to
[1:35:00] give his life a ransom for many
[1:35:04] First Timothy 2 and 5 and
[1:35:07] 6.
[1:35:09] there is one God and one mediator
[1:35:11] between God and Men the man Christ Jesus
[1:35:13] who gave himself a ransom for all right
[1:35:19] what was that Ransom
[1:35:24] it's not the price of the body
[1:35:29] the price of the Soul
[1:35:32] I want to ransom for my soul
[1:35:34] don't you
[1:35:37] I want to ransom for my soul
[1:35:39] let's stand together we'll go into the
[1:35:41] communion
[1:35:50] because the Bible said to Soul at
[1:35:52] sinneth
[1:35:53] is what would I not the body not the
[1:35:56] spirits we're dealing with it's a soul
[1:36:00] First Corinthians 11 23 for I have
[1:36:02] received of the Lord that which also I
[1:36:04] delivered unto you
[1:36:06] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:36:08] which he was betrayed took bread and
[1:36:10] when he had given thanks he break it and
[1:36:12] said take eat this is my body which is
[1:36:14] broken for you it's due in remembrance
[1:36:16] of me after the same manner also he took
[1:36:19] the cup when he had stopped saying this
[1:36:22] cup is a new testament in my blood this
[1:36:25] new year as often as you drink it in
[1:36:27] remembrance of me
[1:36:28] for as often as you eat this bread and
[1:36:31] drink this cup you do shoot the Lord's
[1:36:33] death till he come or for whosoever
[1:36:35] shall eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:36:37] of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty
[1:36:39] of the body and blood of the Lord
[1:36:42] but let a man examine himself and so let
[1:36:44] him eat that bread and drink of that cup
[1:36:46] for he did Edith and drinketh unworldly
[1:36:48] Edith and drinketh Damnation to himself
[1:36:50] not Discerning the Lord's body for this
[1:36:53] caused many are weak and sickly among
[1:36:55] you in many sleep for if we would judge
[1:36:58] ourselves we should not be judged now I
[1:37:00] love this but when we are judged
[1:37:05] it's not just Cast Away
[1:37:08] when we are judged we are chastened to
[1:37:10] the Lord that we should not be condemned
[1:37:13] with the world wherever my brethren when
[1:37:15] you come together to eat Terry one for
[1:37:17] another and if any man hunger let him
[1:37:19] eat at home that you come not together
[1:37:21] in the condemnation the rest will I said
[1:37:24] in order
[1:37:25] when I come
[1:37:27] let's just have a few moments of Silent
[1:37:30] prayer praying one for the other and
[1:37:32] especially you pray for me I pray for
[1:37:34] you
[1:37:35] and we pray that the Lord would bless
[1:37:36] and help us and keep us and guide us on
[1:37:39] into his word that we need because I'm
[1:37:43] looking forward to getting on the other
[1:37:44] side I've always made a statement to you
[1:37:47] that I believe just what we're great
[1:37:50] understanding we're getting here is just
[1:37:52] going to be a foundation when we get
[1:37:54] over there to be able to understand with
[1:37:57] because it's going to be a wonderful
[1:37:59] time
[1:38:00] to get together and listen to the word
[1:38:02] what about sitting down listening to the
[1:38:04] Lord Jesus himself
[1:38:07] he tried to talk to them disciples
[1:38:09] didn't he
[1:38:10] they couldn't understand him
[1:38:14] the best he could do in explaining
[1:38:16] everything finally brought a statement
[1:38:19] from one of them it says
[1:38:22] now we know that
[1:38:24] nobody has to tell you anything
[1:38:27] they had finally caught on to some
[1:38:29] things and
[1:38:30] neither that or one point there the Lord
[1:38:33] said do you mean to you now believe
[1:38:35] you know
[1:38:37] well see I think it's about the time
[1:38:38] that we at least we can start saying we
[1:38:40] do believe don't you that we've been
[1:38:42] around quite a while in studying the
[1:38:44] word of the Lord and we ought to do that
[1:38:46] but let's just pray and just pray one
[1:38:48] for another silently remember Wade there
[1:38:50] because I know they're finished up now
[1:38:52] over there and there are probably uh
[1:38:58] late in the night because it's different
[1:39:00] in the time but we just pray that the
[1:39:03] Lord would bless I hope he'll get to do
[1:39:04] it I did when I was over there we had
[1:39:06] communion and I really enjoyed that
[1:39:08] because they had the communion and the
[1:39:10] foot washing while I was there I enjoyed
[1:39:13] it into that country you know been able
[1:39:15] to do it in Jamaica been able to do it
[1:39:18] in Ireland and been able to do it in the
[1:39:20] Philippines I'd love to go to all these
[1:39:22] countries and just have that communion
[1:39:24] foot washing with the brothers and
[1:39:26] sisters because it'd be a great time
[1:39:27] right but let's pray
[1:39:34] thank you
[1:39:36] all right
[1:39:47] we thank you Father for your word and
[1:39:49] your truth and I just may our hearts
[1:39:51] Rejoice upon what we see and be able to
[1:39:54] follow in you as we're going into this
[1:39:56] part here of the the communion Lord we
[1:39:59] pray that you'd make us all worthy
[1:40:01] because it is not what we can do to make
[1:40:04] ourselves worthy no matter what we could
[1:40:06] do we wouldn't be but yet you can do a
[1:40:09] simple act as you've done to cleanse
[1:40:11] away everything to where we're worthy to
[1:40:14] take the communion so we ask you to do
[1:40:16] that now in Jesus name
[1:40:21] the Bible said he took bread and blessed
[1:40:23] it
[1:40:24] father we thank you for this bread it's
[1:40:26] been made for this purpose this
[1:40:27] afternoon and now we come to the place
[1:40:30] of asking you that it's just a
[1:40:33] representation
[1:40:35] of your actual body that was given for
[1:40:37] each one of us
[1:40:38] and the word that has been made
[1:40:41] available to each one we ask you that
[1:40:43] you would just come down sanctify this
[1:40:46] bread and the partakers in Jesus name
[1:41:19] you know you think about what happened
[1:41:21] in that upper room and
[1:41:25] you think about the
[1:41:28] the time of the Lord Jesus expressing
[1:41:30] these things
[1:41:32] to the disciples
[1:41:35] they didn't understand all of it but
[1:41:38] they followed it
[1:41:40] you know and they saw what it
[1:41:42] happened
[1:41:44] and they knew that something was taking
[1:41:46] place
[1:41:49] and that they were had the ability to
[1:41:51] sit there and see it
[1:41:55] and to realize then maybe they didn't
[1:41:58] realize when he said you know this is my
[1:42:01] body
[1:42:02] but later on the Apostle Paul was able
[1:42:05] to take it and break it down
[1:42:07] they understood enough to know to do it
[1:42:10] but they needed understanding and so do
[1:42:12] we father we ask you to sanctify this
[1:42:14] wine to the partakers that the wine Lord
[1:42:17] symbolic of your blood that was shed for
[1:42:19] each one of us and as we eat the little
[1:42:21] piece of bread we drink this little bit
[1:42:23] of wine tomorrow it'll be blood cells in
[1:42:26] our bodies to help us to live there is
[1:42:28] something literal about this
[1:42:30] but yet we want to see the spiritual
[1:42:32] Lord of understanding that communion
[1:42:35] like brother Bob's been trying to
[1:42:36] express downstairs is to Fellowship it's
[1:42:40] to to sit down and the prophet said a
[1:42:42] lot of times we we pray but we don't
[1:42:44] listen for God to speak to us and that
[1:42:47] way he can't fellowship with us so we
[1:42:49] just ask you to have your way with us
[1:42:51] forgive our sins cleanse us sanctify the
[1:42:54] wine in Jesus name
[1:43:15] I know it was the blood
[1:43:18] I know it was the blood
[1:43:22] and I know it was the blood for me
[1:43:27] one day when I was lost
[1:43:30] he died upon the cross
[1:43:34] and I know it was the blood for their
[1:43:37] knee it was Emmanuel's blood
[1:43:42] and it was Emmanuel's blood
[1:43:46] it was a man who was blood for me
[1:43:51] one day when I was lost
[1:43:54] he died upon the cross and I know it was
[1:43:59] a blood for me
[1:44:03] I know it was Supply
[1:44:06] I know it was the blood
[1:44:10] I know it was supposed
[1:44:13] for me
[1:44:16] one day when I was lost he died upon the
[1:44:21] cross
[1:44:22] and I know it was a blood
[1:44:25] for me
[1:44:28] I know it was the blood
[1:44:31] I know it was a blood
[1:44:34] I know it was your blood for me
[1:44:40] one day when I was lost
[1:44:43] he died upon the cross
[1:44:46] and I know it was the blood for me
[1:44:51] what about the people of this message
[1:44:53] that are so great revelated you know and
[1:44:57] I'm not making light I'm just telling
[1:44:59] the truth but there's people that quit
[1:45:01] taking communion
[1:45:04] okay
[1:45:05] and the reason they quit taking
[1:45:07] communion because it says to do this
[1:45:09] till I come
[1:45:10] and they said well he's already here
[1:45:13] he come in 63.
[1:45:16] with a pillar of fire and out there in
[1:45:18] in Arizona you know so we don't take the
[1:45:21] communion no more
[1:45:24] now that's great Revelation isn't it
[1:45:29] and really spend probably hours
[1:45:32] rebuking people who do take communion
[1:45:36] you know are talking about them and low
[1:45:39] rating them you know and how to dirt and
[1:45:41] filthy we are for not understanding
[1:45:45] foreign
[1:45:46] but you know
[1:45:49] the prophet said
[1:45:51] that when we get there
[1:45:54] the marriage supper is going to be the
[1:45:56] communion
[1:45:58] right
[1:46:00] he said be the communion
[1:46:03] well I'd sure love to be here taking
[1:46:06] communion
[1:46:07] and then just right there
[1:46:10] you know chained in a moment a twinkling
[1:46:13] of an eye and just stepped right over
[1:46:16] into that
[1:46:18] place
[1:46:20] and take the communion wouldn't you
[1:46:23] wouldn't that be a great opportunity
[1:46:36] let's all partake together
[1:46:49] you can be seated for a moment while
[1:46:50] we're getting ready
[1:46:55] we read the scripture from John
[1:46:58] 13.
[1:47:00] for the foot washing
[1:47:03] supper being ended the devil having now
[1:47:05] put into the heart of Judas iscari
[1:47:07] Simon's son to betray him
[1:47:10] so if we're coming to the foot wash and
[1:47:12] then you know Simon
[1:47:15] took part of the communion
[1:47:18] and then turned around and denied the
[1:47:19] Lord Jesus
[1:47:21] Cody is still here at the foot washing
[1:47:24] you know and supper being ended the
[1:47:26] devil having now put into the heart of
[1:47:28] Judas is Simon's son to betray him Jesus
[1:47:30] knowing that the father had given all
[1:47:31] things into his hands that he was coming
[1:47:33] from God and went to God he rises from
[1:47:35] supper and laid aside his garments and
[1:47:37] took a dowel and girded himself after
[1:47:40] that he poured water into a basin and
[1:47:42] began to wash the disciples feet and to
[1:47:44] wipe them with a towel wherewith he was
[1:47:46] girded then cometh heed of Simon Peter
[1:47:48] and Peter saith unto him Lord just I
[1:47:51] washed my feet Jesus answered and said
[1:47:53] unto him what I do that I know it's not
[1:47:55] now but thy shalt know Hereafter
[1:47:58] Peter saith unto him Thou shalt never
[1:48:00] wash my feet Jesus answered him if I
[1:48:03] wash thee not thou has no part with me
[1:48:05] Simon Peter saith unto them Lord not my
[1:48:09] feet only but also my hands and my head
[1:48:12] I'd like to stop there and preach about
[1:48:14] an hour or two on what I was saying this
[1:48:16] morning that
[1:48:17] today
[1:48:20] that in spirit and body
[1:48:22] we can get offended
[1:48:28] but if your soul is right
[1:48:31] you will not get offended in your soul
[1:48:34] is that what this man done
[1:48:37] because Jesus answers it if I wash thee
[1:48:40] not thou has no part with me Peter
[1:48:41] immediately seen wait a minute
[1:48:43] there's something here that needs to be
[1:48:45] right
[1:48:46] Simon Peter saith unto him Lord not my
[1:48:48] feet only but I'll throw my hands in my
[1:48:50] head she just said to him he that is
[1:48:53] worse neither is not saved or wash his
[1:48:55] feet
[1:48:55] with his clean every wit and you are not
[1:48:57] clean
[1:49:00] and and you are clean but not all
[1:49:03] for he knew who should betray him
[1:49:05] therefore said he you are not all
[1:49:07] cleanse
[1:49:09] oh Judas was still sitting there with me
[1:49:12] so after had washed her feed and then
[1:49:14] taken his garments and was set down
[1:49:15] again he said unto them know you what
[1:49:18] I've done to you you call me master and
[1:49:20] Lord and you say well for so I am if I
[1:49:23] then your Lord and Master have washed
[1:49:24] your feet you also want to wash one
[1:49:26] another's feet and I've given you an
[1:49:28] example that you should do as I have
[1:49:30] done to you verily verily I say unto you
[1:49:32] the servant is not greater than his Lord
[1:49:36] neither he that is sent greater than he
[1:49:38] that sent him if you know these things
[1:49:41] happy are ye if you do them let's Stand
[1:49:45] Together
[1:49:46] if you know him we'll do them
[1:49:48] Judas
[1:49:52] you know
[1:49:54] but of course everybody's got their
[1:49:56] great Revelations hasn't it
[1:50:00] do you know that
[1:50:01] some people believe that they had the
[1:50:04] foot washing first
[1:50:07] and that way Judas could leave
[1:50:11] and then had the communion last
[1:50:15] and in a Minister's meeting we was
[1:50:17] having one time and they were just man
[1:50:18] they were just arguing like everything I
[1:50:21] finally I said brother moat
[1:50:23] would you mind telling us what they done
[1:50:25] at the Tabernacle
[1:50:27] he said they had communion and had foot
[1:50:30] washing I said problem solved
[1:50:34] we don't need to discuss it no more
[1:50:37] but that's what they were if you had
[1:50:39] foot washing first
[1:50:42] that's a great Revelation see oh
[1:50:45] wonderful yeah
[1:50:48] don't work too good
