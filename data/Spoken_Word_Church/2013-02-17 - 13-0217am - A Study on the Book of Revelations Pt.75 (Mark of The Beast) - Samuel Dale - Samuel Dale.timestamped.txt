[4:15] how we first met
[4:17] and
[4:18] and everything wade did he had to read
[4:20] it off she forgot a glasses

[4:28] even remember the first time you saw
[4:29] your girlfriend i bet you yeah
[4:31] that i can as a
[4:33] beautiful little
[4:35] black-headed girl

[4:46] so i kind of held up
[4:48] she cooked me a meal and i swore
[4:51] because she's only 14.
[4:52] then i swore that her mother cooked it

[5:55] we're going to have
[5:57] this brother
[5:59] let me ask me ask a question oh bad
[6:02] question i asked
[6:04] brother bob it's your dad rob
[6:07] brother black are you planning on being
[6:09] with us this afternoon we're going to
[6:11] have the the ordination this morning or
[6:14] do we need to have it this afternoon
[6:16] this morning but i

[6:19] back home okay so we got a
[6:21] room full this morning on what we're
[6:23] doing okay we'll have the ordination of
[6:25] our brother because i wanted to get him
[6:27] ordained because
[6:29] you see
[6:30] i pastored church for 10 years before it
[6:32] ever ordained
[6:36] i guess it's longer than that i don't
[6:38] really know i've probably been preaching
[6:40] 20 years when they finally got around to
[6:41] ordain me
[6:43] i couldn't get nobody to do it
[6:51] all right let's read our scripture
[6:54] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[6:56] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[6:58] things which must shortly come to christ
[7:00] and he sent in signified it by his angel
[7:03] and to his servant john
[7:05] who by record of the word of god and the
[7:07] testimony of jesus christ of all things
[7:09] that he saw
[7:10] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[7:12] hear the words of this prophecy
[7:14] and keep those things which are written
[7:16] therein for the time is at hand
[7:20] all right revelations
[7:22] 13 11
[7:26] and i beheld another beast coming up out
[7:28] of the earth
[7:30] notice coming see because it's over here
[7:32] in america
[7:34] there wasn't anything here and then it
[7:36] came up
[7:37] and he had two horns like like a lamb
[7:40] and he spake as a dragon
[7:42] and he exercised all the power of the
[7:44] first beast before him and caused the
[7:46] earth and them which dwelt therein
[7:49] to worship the beast whose deadly wound
[7:51] was healed
[7:53] and he doeth great wonders so that he
[7:55] make a fire come down from
[7:57] heaven on the earth
[7:59] on the earth in the sight of men and
[8:01] deceiveth them that dwell upon
[8:04] dwell on the earth by the means of those
[8:06] miracles which he had power to do in the
[8:08] sight of me of the beast
[8:10] so unto them that dwell on the earth
[8:12] that they should make an image to the
[8:13] beast
[8:14] which had the wound of a sword and did
[8:16] live
[8:18] he had power to give
[8:20] life unto the image of the beast that
[8:22] the image of the beast should both speak
[8:24] and caused that as many as would not
[8:27] worship
[8:28] the image of the beast should be killed
[8:31] he calls us all both small and great
[8:33] rich and poor free and bond to receive a
[8:35] mark in their right hand
[8:38] or in their foreheads and that no man
[8:40] might buy or sell save he that had the
[8:43] mark
[8:44] or the name of the beast and watch the
[8:48] mark the name of the beast
[8:50] or the number of his
[8:52] name here is wisdom that him that has
[8:56] understanding count the number of the
[8:57] beast
[8:58] whereas the number of a man and his
[9:00] number is 600
[9:03] three score and six you may be seated
[9:05] lord at his blessing brother dean has a
[9:08] testimony of him he would just come
[9:10] ahead
[9:17] good morning
[9:19] i'd like to
[9:21] take a few minutes there in just a few
[9:22] years if i could get by with it
[9:25] until what happened to peggy about two
[9:27] weeks or so ago
[9:28] we had uh been down to her was down at
[9:31] her daddy's house in white plains in
[9:33] grand county
[9:34] and uh hadn't been there long and i was
[9:36] still in my truck and she was over to
[9:38] daddy's house and she called me on
[9:39] telephone and says dean
[9:41] you might already get over here and
[9:42] bleed
[9:43] pretty bad and uh
[9:46] so i just thought it was a nosebleed you
[9:48] know and uh i went away and god i'll
[9:51] tell you the truth it scared me to deal
[9:53] i'm telling you it takes something to
[9:54] frighten me but i guess
[9:56] somebody did you live like i love my
[9:58] wife
[9:59] it was it was it wasn't a simple
[10:02] nosebleed it was it was running it was
[10:04] it
[10:05] figured my finger
[10:06] and blood was everywhere and she had she
[10:09] had her hand out like this where it had
[10:11] clotted in her whole hand had a big big
[10:14] clot in it and she was swallowing it
[10:16] down and it was coming out of her so i
[10:22] began to pray
[10:23] and uh
[10:25] took her to
[10:27] i started to uh at the original
[10:30] hospital up there and i got to almost to
[10:32] grieve her and i said
[10:34] she can't make it somebody seemed to
[10:36] expect to speak to me says she'll never
[10:38] make it
[10:39] so i
[10:40] wheeled in there at saint mary's
[10:42] in greensboro
[10:44] and they
[10:45] took it right in and went to working on
[10:47] her
[10:48] and they couldn't they couldn't get it
[10:50] they were putting them things up her
[10:52] nose and all that stuff and
[10:54] and then finally after i don't know two
[10:56] or three hours we was there and they was
[10:58] working with her the whole time and the
[11:01] doctor knew about her absent disease and
[11:04] and all this thing in her blood she had
[11:06] lost so much blood wow and she was weak
[11:09] and
[11:10] and i i'm i'm just i'm just putting it
[11:12] in god's hands but but i'm praying
[11:15] and when you get so
[11:17] so
[11:18] burdened you can't even hardly pray
[11:20] correct
[11:21] but that's when god has to come along
[11:26] yep
[11:31] excuse me all right
[11:34] so the doctor said i can't do that next
[11:36] here you're gonna have to get her
[11:38] somewhere else so i i wouldn't wait for
[11:40] the ambulance to take her
[11:42] so i got in the car and i headed up to
[11:45] athens regional
[11:46] and we got there
[11:48] they took us in there and i've never
[11:49] seen such an incompetent punch a bunch
[11:51] of people in my life
[11:53] i'll tell you i'm in that mercy room
[11:55] there i'm just
[11:56] maybe i shouldn't do this but they
[11:58] didn't do nothing
[11:59] they just talked about well we don't
[12:01] really want to take this because it has
[12:03] slacked off
[12:04] and uh so we don't want to take this out
[12:06] i understand that but i knew my wife
[12:12] and she doesn't lost all this blood and
[12:14] and and she's got addison i know y'all
[12:17] don't know what that is most of you
[12:19] don't but you nurses do
[12:21] they they know what it can kill you and
[12:23] i i've had it to almost take her life
[12:25] several times since we've been married
[12:28] and uh
[12:29] so anyway they they we stayed there two
[12:31] or three hours and they sent us home i
[12:34] says
[12:35] i just shaking my head i said
[12:37] we'll be back
[12:39] so about 3 30 that morning she she said
[12:42] dean i'm bleeding again i mean and it
[12:44] was i mean they her nose they had those
[12:47] things stuck up her nose and where they
[12:49] pumped that air in them
[12:50] and her nose looked like a big bulb
[12:53] i mean it was so it was in
[12:55] the ent the ear nose throat doctor was
[12:58] worried about her nose when we finally
[12:59] did we couldn't get a ent
[13:02] to come to the hospital couldn't even
[13:04] get him to come out there because when
[13:05] it was a nosebleed because they wouldn't
[13:07] tell me how bad it was it wasn't just a
[13:09] simple nosebleed she was bleeding to
[13:11] death it was an artery and they still
[13:14] hadn't found out where it was at i've
[13:16] been in in in when we got out
[13:20] this that morning when i brought her
[13:22] back over there she uh
[13:24] uh
[13:25] they took these things out and put
[13:26] bigger ones in and it goes all the way
[13:28] up in the head anybody that knows what
[13:30] it is she got one up here and one here
[13:32] and got two hoses hanging out there they
[13:34] pump up and like an inner tube to try to
[13:38] you know put to get wherever that's
[13:40] bleeding to stop it
[13:42] and uh
[13:43] so uh they they run some put ivy on it
[13:47] and
[13:47] run some tests
[13:49] and and i if i'm wrong here god forgive
[13:51] me but but this is where i believe they
[13:53] put a bag of potassium they knew
[13:55] protection was low and they put a bag of
[13:57] potassium in it and and give her
[14:00] potassium by the mouth of the mouth
[14:02] and uh
[14:03] so
[14:05] it quit bleeding i mean you know i don't
[14:07] know how blood could have got out but it
[14:09] was going down her throat you know
[14:11] and uh
[14:12] so that morning that
[14:14] i don't know what time it is i get lost
[14:16] i was numb
[14:18] i mean i'm just all i knew is praying i
[14:19] couldn't leave her
[14:21] and uh
[14:23] she tried to get me to go get something
[14:25] to eat i i said i
[14:26] ain't leaving i ain't i ain't leaving
[14:29] your side
[14:30] and uh
[14:31] so that
[14:33] took us out i mean
[14:36] just discharged us again and we had to
[14:38] go across the street if anybody knows
[14:40] where anthony regional is he's just
[14:42] right across the streets of mcdonald's
[14:44] there's a street right there and you go
[14:46] right down that's about as far view to
[14:47] the street out there and this the ent is
[14:50] right there
[14:51] so
[14:52] we went over there and we went back in
[14:54] the back and he said well i don't want
[14:56] to take this out the same stuff that
[14:58] they did before
[15:00] and so they started discharges
[15:03] and uh
[15:04] peggy she couldn't
[15:06] she was in
[15:08] that
[15:09] and we uh walked into the window
[15:13] you know where you check out
[15:16] and i i was standing there and she was
[15:18] standing right here
[15:19] and she says i heard her say
[15:22] dean i've got to lean up against
[15:23] something and by the time i turned she
[15:25] was going down
[15:27] and i grabbed her
[15:29] and
[15:31] it was dead weight you know
[15:34] it's hard to handle and i took her and i
[15:37] walked away i tried to walk away to lay
[15:40] her down on the floor and her legs
[15:43] were just i mean just
[15:44] twisted all kind of ways and the three
[15:47] doctors was there and they come running
[15:49] out and all the nurses
[15:51] and
[15:52] later on later on out on the floor
[15:56] they're in a dress never did come up
[15:58] that that's a miracle of god
[16:00] and then he was i mean
[16:02] in a way
[16:03] they they took a uh
[16:05] somebody could come run out with a towel
[16:07] and put it up on her head and had her
[16:10] this nurse was holding her feet up but i
[16:12] looked at her
[16:14] and this is this almost killed me
[16:18] i saw her eyes
[16:20] just start to close
[16:23] and all at once
[16:24] they just
[16:25] roll back
[16:27] nothing but white
[16:29] and
[16:30] you want it now that's right
[16:37] i went down
[16:38] i couldn't even pray
[16:43] and i just took my hand
[16:46] and i squatted down there and i took my
[16:47] hand and i laid it on her forehead
[16:51] and just laid there and i in the
[16:52] scripture was there it says little hands
[16:55] that's right i was sick
[16:57] and he shall recover but she was more
[16:59] than sick
[17:00] i don't know how he seemed like an
[17:02] eternity
[17:03] but but all at once with my hands there
[17:06] and i i could never forget the look on
[17:09] her face
[17:10] i could i could never this it branded
[17:13] him in my brain
[17:16] and i saw her ass flicker
[17:19] and i knew the transition had begun
[17:34] let me add this in
[17:35] the doctor was down there with me and he
[17:38] was trying to find a pulse in her neck
[17:40] and he looked and i knew when he looked
[17:42] at me
[17:43] i knew and he was hauling call 9-1-1
[17:46] call 9-1-1 he was just screaming call
[17:49] 9-1-1
[17:51] but
[17:51] when they got there then i just moved up
[17:53] by the way and they picked her up and
[17:55] put her on there yeah
[18:00] what you put them on you know
[18:02] and uh
[18:04] they took they started taking her out
[18:05] and they said we're gonna work with her
[18:07] in here in the in the ambulance and if
[18:09] you want to stay here are going over
[18:12] we'll
[18:13] we'll uh we'll be there in a minute and
[18:15] i stayed
[18:16] and then when they went you know i i
[18:18] went on over but we got over there and
[18:21] they said that they they run all these
[18:23] tests on iraq yeah
[18:25] pretty quick they really went to work on
[18:27] and they said her potassium level
[18:30] was down to 2.7
[18:32] 2.5
[18:34] is critical his last life
[18:38] you could die right and if they hadn't
[18:40] given if that hadn't been for that
[18:42] potassium which i knew her blood she her
[18:44] blood was gone her calcium was gone her
[18:47] potash was gone and she was gone right
[18:50] sir and god brought her back
[19:05] lord is it something
[19:07] in our lives
[19:09] it brought you some power boy
[19:11] it is i'll do anything right sure
[19:14] anything
[19:15] but i'll tell you something i found out
[19:17] i found out what the level was that's
[19:19] right
[19:20] i thought many times you couldn't live
[19:23] your wife no more than my little man
[19:24] come on
[19:25] hopefully wrong yes sir
[19:28] i found out
[19:29] that
[19:30] when the scripture says loving people
[19:32] more than you love yourself your wife
[19:34] more than you ever say if i i feel not
[19:35] about that
[19:37] and i was this morning
[19:39] i was sitting there about
[19:41] three or four o'clock in the morning
[19:43] and i have a bible on my right
[19:46] as a lord i don't ever take your book
[19:48] and use it for a ouija board right but i
[19:50] need to know something all right
[19:53] i said would you
[19:54] would you do it for me
[19:58] i want to read you a scripture that he
[20:00] turned me to
[20:02] it'll hit i believe he'll hit you
[20:03] because see
[20:05] you can use it for a ouija board
[20:07] you can you can you can look at it and
[20:10] see something it may try to make it fit
[20:12] you right but when god speaks back to
[20:14] you
[20:15] this is why he said no church no matter
[20:18] how fundamental that church can't thrive
[20:20] until a supernatural make known among us
[20:22] something that we could speak to that
[20:24] will speak back to us and identify and
[20:26] vindicate himself amen that happened to
[20:28] me
[20:30] and i just
[20:31] this is in isaiah 43
[20:34] 25.
[20:36] i would ask you to read that
[20:40] you read the whole book
[20:42] he says
[20:43] when i when i opened my bible it was
[20:45] right there for him i couldn't get away
[20:47] from this this scripture i had i already
[20:49] had to highlight it
[20:51] it said
[20:52] he spoke to me as well as i speak to
[20:55] y'all this morning god spoke to me he
[20:57] said i
[20:59] even i am he that blighted out thy
[21:01] treasure gracious
[21:02] for my own sake amen
[21:05] and will not remember thy sins
[21:09] amen so i don't worry about it
[21:12] but i will ask you to remember my wife
[21:14] because her blood pressure and giving
[21:16] her pills her blood is low
[21:19] and they give her pills to
[21:22] get her blood pressure up
[21:24] and it's
[21:25] got side effects
[21:27] so
[21:28] i would appreciate it yesterday i just i
[21:30] knew
[21:31] i couldn't do it before today
[21:34] i wanted to do it the first first
[21:35] morning but i just i couldn't do it
[21:37] god bless you we love you amen
[21:53] if you come up
[22:15] all we can do is do as paul would say
[22:18] he says we can lay hands on somebody
[22:21] just
[22:21] gift
[22:23] we can't give them a gift
[22:25] as to make them a minister
[22:28] and that's not what we try to do
[22:30] bob come to us and he told us about it
[22:32] and
[22:33] i said well brother bob just run as long
[22:35] as you can
[22:37] and then when the lord gets through
[22:38] running you down and
[22:40] you get ready you'll be able to uh
[22:42] and use it
[22:44] and everything so it didn't
[22:46] go too long until he came and he said
[22:49] well
[22:50] i'm ready i said well all right then
[22:52] you'll just be put in and be one of us
[22:55] is a minister
[22:57] but like i say we want to lay hands on
[22:59] him to stir up the gift
[23:01] that is within him because we didn't
[23:03] call him to preach
[23:04] god called him to preach for the
[23:06] foundation of the world that's right
[23:08] so in doing that then we lay hands on
[23:10] just to stir that up and to show that we
[23:12] believe
[23:13] that god has
[23:15] called him
[23:17] you know because we can't call him and
[23:18] we don't send him
[23:20] but we do
[23:22] join with him amen that the lord will
[23:25] bless him and be with him as he goes and
[23:27] ministers the gospel together okay let's
[23:30] pray together brother
[23:31] over our brother he is committing to the
[23:33] lord dedicating him to god father jesus
[23:37] our brother we believe you are graceful
[23:38] father we're so grateful did you sit
[23:40] there brother
[23:42] he sat down and he's listening
[23:46] he's waiting
[23:48] maybe
[24:30] is
[24:44] lord we dedicate them to you also
[24:47] and lord knowing that you are god and
[24:49] you change
[24:51] we love you and we thank you
[24:52] we commit our brother to thee now in
[24:54] jesus name
[25:12] a great thing everybody
[25:15] to be called to the ministry
[25:19] remembering that so emphatically of
[25:21] stating that
[25:23] they asked him when they said will the
[25:25] bride have a ministry
[25:29] and it was an odd statement that he made
[25:32] you know he was talking about the bribe
[25:34] the person asking the question
[25:36] wrote around and said
[25:38] sure
[25:39] she consists
[25:41] of apostles
[25:43] prophets evangelists pastors and
[25:45] teachers
[25:47] so she consists of that right
[25:49] not to just say that i've called a
[25:51] faithful ministry
[25:53] right but she
[25:54] consists i see when we ourselves make
[25:58] the ministry what it is
[26:01] we sit down and we listen and we pay
[26:03] attention
[26:05] and as i told brother bob i said there's
[26:07] something in there
[26:09] that god will use you and we can speak
[26:12] and compare and do the best we can
[26:15] and i told him even about myself i said
[26:18] the prophet said god could use you for
[26:21] training for maybe 30 40 years for a 30
[26:23] minute sermon right i said one of these
[26:25] days i'm gonna find that sermon and i'll
[26:27] be able to preach and quit you know
[26:29] but
[26:30] i believe that the call to the ministry
[26:32] is not just your thoughts your ideas or
[26:35] your feelings or whatever you know or
[26:38] some word from somebody or some thought
[26:41] but it's
[26:43] a word paul said
[26:45] the mystery
[26:48] whereof i'm called
[26:50] see most preachers jump up and run off
[26:52] because they think that they're called
[26:54] but you see after a while they don't
[26:56] have much to say right
[26:58] and i'm sorry i'm gonna do this you know
[26:59] i just say it like it is the way i see
[27:01] it right
[27:02] but if god calls a man he'd give him a
[27:04] word
[27:13] now let's get on into the book of
[27:14] revelations and
[27:17] our thought for today
[27:19] we covered the
[27:22] reading there in our scriptures about
[27:25] how the
[27:26] you know
[27:27] that
[27:28] the image our last message was on the
[27:30] image of the beast
[27:32] and we know that
[27:34] that image of the beast was made here in
[27:36] the united states
[27:38] brother branham will read it just a
[27:40] little bit
[27:41] that
[27:43] that beast over there she started
[27:46] with the people and the multitudes and
[27:48] the kind
[27:50] but then when you see it here in america
[27:52] it comes that come up out of the sea
[27:55] which is people
[27:56] but this comes up out of the earth right
[27:59] because there wasn't a lot of people
[28:00] over here you wouldn't even count the
[28:02] people as being here
[28:04] as uh the form you know that we talk of
[28:06] christianities or whatever religious
[28:09] matters
[28:10] in the day that would our would be
[28:12] indians or whatever it was already here
[28:14] so he just referenced into the fact that
[28:17] it comes up
[28:19] out of the people right right now
[28:22] and it'll form as we read there a mark
[28:24] of the beast so that's what we're going
[28:26] to go into today and all of you know the
[28:29] the thoughts and the ideas and the
[28:31] quotes and the things but let's just go
[28:33] through it
[28:34] in in thinking about some things
[28:38] of where we're at we know that the
[28:41] revelations 13
[28:43] is the
[28:44] chapter that the prophet refers to as
[28:46] being america
[28:48] right we came here for freedom of
[28:51] religion we started out as a lamb
[28:55] and then he said it will never become an
[28:57] old
[28:58] round
[29:00] because it'll end before all of that
[29:02] would take place
[29:03] but we're going to form our are are
[29:06] already forming
[29:08] the image to the beast
[29:10] all right now
[29:12] what was that
[29:15] doing as we talked about image of the
[29:17] beast
[29:20] an image is an exact likeness
[29:23] right
[29:24] so we came to america to get away from
[29:27] the religious world
[29:29] of things
[29:31] but what did we bring over here
[29:35] satan is so deceiving until
[29:38] riding in the very boat to come to
[29:40] america for freedom
[29:43] was both
[29:44] the good and the bad
[29:47] the ones that would start and take us
[29:49] down
[29:50] bring us to a position of actually
[29:53] forming a very image
[29:55] unto the beast would be riding in the
[29:57] same boat as the ones who came here
[30:00] to receive their freedom
[30:02] and we covered it where brother brown
[30:03] said that actually martin luther
[30:06] see when he came out with a protest in
[30:08] the catholic church
[30:11] to show that it would turn out to be
[30:12] like it is then it turns around and
[30:17] denominates
[30:20] now luther didn't denominate himself no
[30:22] right we know that
[30:24] so when brother around says luther
[30:26] denominated and you'll even find him one
[30:28] time saying luther denominated and died
[30:31] but then luther himself
[30:34] was the man of god for the hour
[30:37] but you got to remember
[30:39] that he was limited to what
[30:41] understanding he could have right
[30:44] so he already had the catholic doctrine
[30:47] right
[30:48] if you studied never studied anything
[30:50] about the history of martin luther
[30:52] he did not want to get out of the
[30:54] catholic church
[30:56] he wanted to reform
[30:59] that was what
[31:00] was called a reformation back in those
[31:02] periods he wanted to change the church
[31:04] well that's everybody's ideal you know
[31:06] i did it didn't you i i stayed about six
[31:09] or eight months in the baptist church or
[31:12] maybe a little over that almost a year
[31:14] after hearing this message and
[31:17] and even the kids when i left they said
[31:18] we know why sam left
[31:21] because he was teaching us all right
[31:24] because i was trying to get people to
[31:25] see the truth
[31:27] right right but see sometimes you got to
[31:29] wind up saying okay
[31:32] i've done all i can do i've got to move
[31:34] on
[31:35] well see it wasn't the day to have that
[31:37] understanding so
[31:40] brother brandon would say martin luther
[31:42] then would
[31:43] bring out of those things things with
[31:45] him
[31:47] that would actually start that church
[31:49] right back in
[31:50] the same thing because it would be the
[31:52] image
[31:54] all right
[31:56] see then you know
[31:57] it was his day and his time
[32:02] because that's why they're waiting on
[32:03] you and i too
[32:05] right yeah see john wesley he comes
[32:07] forward right around and stands with the
[32:08] message he said first thing you know
[32:10] they denominated
[32:12] but wesley even said i read it where he
[32:14] said i'd rather die than to see them to
[32:16] nominate my church
[32:18] as they did martin luther
[32:21] but you know what they did
[32:22] immediately after his passing on
[32:26] they took the church right back into the
[32:28] same catholicism
[32:30] well we come on into the pentecostals
[32:32] and
[32:33] we know what they've done
[32:35] they may have done it in a little
[32:37] different form
[32:38] but it's still the same old dealings
[32:40] right
[32:41] they came in to then more of a
[32:44] uh
[32:47] picking up of an atmosphere or religious
[32:49] matters or what does that work as
[32:51] america
[32:52] how you say it
[32:53] as they came on in and began to
[32:56] try to stir the people up and
[32:58] there was a wonderful bride part down
[33:00] right there
[33:01] they're part of the bride
[33:03] each one of those ages is part of the
[33:04] bride
[33:06] but also at the same time it was forming
[33:08] an image to the beast right but and the
[33:10] people themselves were being caught
[33:13] right into it
[33:16] you realize as we'll get to it the mark
[33:18] of the beast here of what
[33:20] it's just to have their understanding in
[33:22] your forehead
[33:26] mark of the beast is not a tattoo
[33:28] snapped on you somewhere
[33:31] right
[33:33] no
[33:34] this is in your understanding right
[33:36] right when we get to that in a few
[33:38] minutes we have time but not we'll get
[33:40] it this evening
[33:42] but the point i want you to see is
[33:44] we can be just as
[33:48] churchy right
[33:51] we can be just as
[33:53] denominated
[33:55] as any other movement
[34:01] that could ever be
[34:04] and you know you go down right now and
[34:06] you tell the baptist you say
[34:08] you already have the mark of the beast
[34:12] well they're going to run you out
[34:15] and they're going to make sure you leave
[34:17] from them right
[34:19] because they don't believe they have it
[34:21] that's right
[34:26] but i want you to think of this thought
[34:27] we'll get back to it later
[34:30] if you don't have the baptism of the
[34:32] holy ghost this day
[34:34] you're already marked
[34:36] with the mark of the beast that's right
[34:38] amen
[34:39] because there's only two people
[34:41] right you're either out of the seal of
[34:43] god or the mark of the beast
[34:45] so the world we was born into
[34:49] life as we are the domain we live in
[34:52] which is satanic
[34:54] the best we can do
[34:58] were lost
[35:01] sealed away from god
[35:05] he said no no no i've been a christian
[35:07] all my life well
[35:09] even we that have been or some that have
[35:12] been a christian since they're very
[35:13] young years
[35:18] that's the point i want you to see
[35:21] you don't get nothing out of the message
[35:23] today get this one thing
[35:27] that you can be a christian and you're
[35:29] born-again experience in your soul
[35:33] have eternal life
[35:36] in that soul
[35:40] but yet in the other parts of you
[35:43] be just as organized
[35:45] as any catholic priest
[35:49] no
[35:51] now that's the one hard to swallow
[35:54] right
[35:57] you're not going to be lost and go to
[35:58] hell no
[36:02] but don't tell me we're going into
[36:04] rapture with a organizational mind
[36:07] all right man
[36:11] i've
[36:12] told you 40 years ago right at it
[36:15] i said the way i see it the biggest
[36:18] portion of the people of this message
[36:19] will die and go by the grave
[36:22] before the rapture comes because what
[36:24] are you going to do
[36:27] i have never de-christianized anybody
[36:31] intentionally
[36:33] you know
[36:34] to do
[36:35] but i don't see how you can go in the
[36:37] rapture
[36:38] with denominational ideas
[36:42] i just don't see that now because that
[36:43] was what eve put us out of the garden
[36:47] she said i think
[36:53] this is my idea
[36:56] this is my understanding
[37:01] i have great wisdom now
[37:05] isn't that the basis of all people are
[37:07] their thoughts and ideas
[37:09] but to just think about it as
[37:11] the great america that we came here
[37:14] in in my poor mother-in-law i mean i'm
[37:16] not throwing off on her i just tell it
[37:17] like he did she was a wonderful sweet
[37:19] mother-in-law
[37:21] greatest in the world if everybody had a
[37:23] mother-in-law like my mother-in-law you
[37:24] wouldn't all these jokes wouldn't be
[37:26] made about mother-in-law
[37:28] you don't see me making one
[37:31] you know
[37:32] because she was a wonderful mother
[37:34] mother-in-law
[37:36] but we were talking one day something
[37:38] about
[37:39] mark of the beast or some form and she
[37:41] said
[37:42] well sam said
[37:44] god wouldn't let that happen to this
[37:46] christian america
[37:48] see that was her thought
[37:51] her thought was is christian america
[37:55] you know it was in the paper the other
[37:56] day when they were talking about the
[37:57] pope
[37:59] resigning that
[38:00] they are 1.2
[38:03] billion
[38:04] catholics in the world
[38:08] you realize that's
[38:09] one-seventh or how would you count that
[38:11] because it's seven billion people
[38:13] might be about one a little over one
[38:15] seven
[38:17] one out of every seven right
[38:20] let's be a catholic
[38:22] that's not cotton they have this message
[38:24] this presbyterian pentecostal and little
[38:27] ox and randomized that's not counting
[38:30] all them
[38:32] you just think that a big portion of
[38:34] this world is really in the realm of
[38:37] what you would even call
[38:38] christian or christianity
[38:44] but yet look how confused it is
[38:47] look how messed up it is
[38:50] but i'm still not i've always said that
[38:52] since i started here because i told god
[38:54] years ago
[38:56] when he called me to preach i said i
[38:57] won't preach against that church that
[38:59] know yonder
[39:00] this was back before there's everyone
[39:02] sitting over there
[39:03] you know they wouldn't learn
[39:04] i said i'm not going to preach against
[39:06] organized religion
[39:08] of method this baptism and all
[39:13] i see too much of it among us
[39:18] and i made that statement years ago and
[39:20] i still believe that the biggest portion
[39:22] of people this message
[39:24] cannot retain or obtain
[39:27] to the position of being able to change
[39:29] in a moment of twinkling or not and i
[39:30] may be one of them
[39:33] and i never did christianize anybody for
[39:35] dying
[39:38] but you look at a lot of people around
[39:39] this message of the past
[39:41] young people
[39:42] right that have passed on to be with the
[39:44] lord
[39:45] no
[39:46] well i never said they wouldn't say
[39:51] i've always been defensive just like
[39:53] that a word that you can actually quote
[39:55] i can give you a quote around like i
[39:57] said he said luther denominated and died
[40:01] he said look there one time i'm 99 i'm
[40:03] not sure
[40:06] he said luther died and went to hell
[40:12] run your computer and see
[40:14] man
[40:15] now what was he saying
[40:19] did martin luther that was a born-again
[40:21] christian
[40:23] a church-aged messenger to bring the
[40:25] message of the just shall live by faith
[40:27] was he saying that he died and went to
[40:29] hell no the lutheran
[40:32] right those who at the time even looked
[40:35] there were still alive was burning down
[40:36] the churches because they thought that's
[40:39] what he taught
[40:41] and he was fighting organized religions
[40:42] so much they just went out and started
[40:44] burning churches
[40:47] nobody brought around city
[40:49] it was about him holding his head high
[40:51] about all the fanaticism
[40:53] but then look at it as it comes on down
[40:56] to closer to the truth people come
[40:59] yet they're closer to the truth that the
[41:01] people come to bring it from
[41:03] justification
[41:04] sanctification the baptism of the holy
[41:07] ghost and the word
[41:08] is where the image of the beast comes
[41:11] from
[41:14] you understand we came over here what
[41:17] 1492 columbus sailed the ocean blue you
[41:20] know
[41:23] then we was reading there the other day
[41:24] since barbara gave me a couple of things
[41:27] the first man landed in america was a
[41:29] jew
[41:31] they had a doctor
[41:33] the uh the navigator was a jew it was
[41:36] about four of the great men that was
[41:38] with columbus and they even wonder if he
[41:40] was part jew
[41:42] he came to america
[41:47] you see we come over here to get away
[41:48] from a religious form
[41:51] and got over here and formed our own
[41:54] and just made an image to that was over
[41:56] there right
[41:57] if you have the same doctrine that
[41:59] somebody has that's an image right right
[42:03] he said brother them ever since i come
[42:05] in this message i believe in one god
[42:10] well
[42:12] the large number of the people that's
[42:13] mexican believe in two lords
[42:17] you go ahead and do all you want to
[42:18] about
[42:19] i believe that jesus wouldn't gone to
[42:21] the river jordan you just go ahead and
[42:22] see
[42:24] you're throwing off on people no
[42:25] throwing up on doctrines right
[42:29] see yeah
[42:30] my bible says
[42:34] everything you have
[42:36] god gave it to you
[42:39] you agree with that scripture that's
[42:41] right
[42:42] no matter what how big or how little god
[42:45] gave it to us
[42:47] we didn't choose to be what we are
[42:50] did you choose to leave your
[42:52] denominational churches i was running
[42:53] pretty good i was well-known god
[42:56] you know in my 20s it was
[43:01] well respected
[43:04] teaching adult sunday school class which
[43:06] was the deacons and elders in the church
[43:08] when i left
[43:12] but you see i had to one day walk out
[43:14] there
[43:16] and my wife didn't even know i was
[43:18] leaving
[43:19] we hadn't talked about it we had studied
[43:21] the message
[43:23] and i told her i said
[43:25] i'm not going to make you go
[43:28] i'll supply you a way to get to that
[43:30] church and i'll do everything i can but
[43:32] i've got to go honey
[43:34] but she walked out with me
[43:37] well
[43:38] but you see church we can come right
[43:40] here and sit right down and anchor in
[43:42] this message and holler all we want to
[43:45] that we believe the prophet's message
[43:47] and be distant organizational
[43:48] denominational
[43:50] is any catholic church
[43:53] that's right
[43:56] what's the difference in believing
[43:57] in the deity of the catholic church or
[43:59] the deity of the people of this message
[44:06] you know the difference is
[44:09] they vote one end voted nothing out
[44:12] their god can quit
[44:15] right
[44:16] i'm not joking or not making remarks
[44:20] i'm speaking
[44:22] but the people of this message their god
[44:24] doesn't change
[44:25] they made it william bradlem and they've
[44:27] held on to that
[44:30] but you see we can be just as we're
[44:32] we're the people that can really if you
[44:34] understand what i'm trying to drive at
[44:37] when we came to america
[44:41] luther started the message of the
[44:42] justice shall live by faith
[44:46] and look what it's formed into
[44:50] here in america as an image to the beast
[44:56] we say those are good people amen
[44:59] we were good people i thought
[45:03] i i thought you just got people when you
[45:05] was back there
[45:06] didn't you
[45:08] but did you realize that
[45:10] the thing that
[45:12] the prophet said
[45:15] started
[45:16] christianity
[45:18] you know the form of what we call it
[45:20] that wound up being the thing that would
[45:22] kill the christians
[45:27] well that's pretty strong
[45:29] there's your image to the beast that's
[45:32] what i was trying to say there the other
[45:33] day honestly we just get the point not
[45:35] to just say america's number 13 stars
[45:38] and stripes that's fine
[45:41] it's just like we talked about it that
[45:43] you know this this woman sits on seven
[45:46] hills
[45:47] that's fine
[45:50] but you better find a place that can
[45:52] control the world and not cincinnati
[45:53] ohio
[45:57] right now when we get down this
[45:58] afternoon and i won't this morning but
[46:00] when we get down to the 666
[46:03] your name might figure out to be
[46:12] 666. but yet you don't rule the world
[46:17] mine might figure out to be that
[46:19] but it don't rule the world
[46:21] you know the religious points
[46:23] all right so we're looking at something
[46:25] that is a great thing
[46:29] at the same time now trying to lay down
[46:32] some things because like i told you
[46:35] when we went over into the seals and
[46:37] bringing it
[46:39] chapter 5 6
[46:41] five in heaven
[46:43] you go over to seven just to start a
[46:45] number seven eight nine ten eleven
[46:47] twelve thirteen it's all in a three and
[46:49] a half year period right
[46:50] called the tribulation
[46:57] the image of the beast is formed
[47:02] before we go out of here the rapture
[47:06] may not be in manifestation
[47:11] but how close is it
[47:17] that's why i'm not against obama or
[47:19] anybody mccain we didn't put him in
[47:21] there we'd probably be in worser shape
[47:24] everybody wants to try to find some
[47:26] something
[47:28] that's when gary had asked me a question
[47:30] about the nra you know that they used to
[47:32] believe the nra was a mark of the beast
[47:35] that's five or six quotes
[47:38] around selections i just happened to see
[47:40] it and run it up
[47:43] communism was the mark of the beast
[47:47] all kind of things turn out to be the
[47:49] mark of the beast
[47:52] and the people sitting with the mark of
[47:54] the beast
[47:55] because i restated i've stated a dozen
[47:58] times probably
[47:59] if we don't have the new birth
[48:02] we have the mark of the beast
[48:07] i don't care how intelligent you are or
[48:10] unintelligent
[48:13] we have the mark of the beast
[48:17] and we're part of the image to the beast
[48:22] i remember when i first began to find
[48:24] out a few things
[48:25] about the
[48:27] the
[48:28] church and all
[48:29] this before i heard the message
[48:32] and i began to find out that we were
[48:34] actually back in the 50s
[48:37] sending money to foreign countries
[48:41] madness
[48:43] was sending money to foreign countries
[48:45] to
[48:47] encourage insurrection into the
[48:49] governments
[48:51] where we could get
[48:53] uh the ability to put our literature at
[48:55] our
[48:56] because it wouldn't let us in a lot of
[48:58] the countries that was what the baptist
[48:59] was doing and i knew of that before i
[49:01] heard about around smash
[49:03] and you know what i done
[49:05] i said well now i'm gonna designate my
[49:07] tithe to stay in this building
[49:10] not real good but
[49:13] mine's gonna stay right here in this
[49:14] building i'm not going to help support
[49:16] insurrection
[49:20] i'm really trying to do a good job just
[49:22] to find my own stupidity
[49:24] but you know how it is i'm just honest
[49:26] to tell you
[49:29] what would you do it
[49:33] when you begin to find out about
[49:34] something
[49:36] we should move on and do something about
[49:37] it
[49:38] right right because it'll get to the
[49:40] point all right
[49:42] now remember how we were bringing out
[49:44] that
[49:45] that's why i love the fact that god sent
[49:48] us a prophet
[49:50] because we've been in this series now
[49:52] for
[49:53] 75 sermons on the book of revelations
[49:57] and uh i even mentioned it to the
[49:59] chiropractor one day and he said
[50:02] most people won't preach out of that
[50:05] i said they just don't know how
[50:06] beautiful the book it is
[50:09] to really see what it means
[50:11] you see we can only say that after the
[50:13] prophet come
[50:14] to give us to break the symbols
[50:17] to where we wouldn't be looking for some
[50:18] king kong walking across the earth and
[50:20] holding up that
[50:22] mark of the beast as a tattoo oh no no
[50:25] no no
[50:26] we we know better that than the 666's
[50:30] but you better watch it might be in your
[50:31] clothes
[50:33] you know covered up somewhere you know
[50:37] we all had it figured out didn't we
[50:40] but what about it
[50:42] what about our all right
[50:44] our ideas
[50:48] are they according to the word
[50:51] okay
[50:53] what a wonderful thing to be able to
[50:55] read the book of revelations like we did
[50:57] there the other day
[50:58] in talking about where brother randall
[51:01] says on the mark of the beast that
[51:03] to call fire down out of heaven see we
[51:06] looked at some kind of a something that
[51:08] we just read here that this man is able
[51:10] to do or this image is able to do
[51:15] he said
[51:18] atomic
[51:23] hydrogen
[51:26] intelligent nation
[51:30] like i said you you you standing over
[51:33] there and you're you're back and you've
[51:34] never even seen a white man or anybody
[51:36] with anything other than sticks and
[51:38] stones to throw at each other
[51:41] about that time here sets a helicopter
[51:43] down and not jumps out with a
[51:44] flamethrower just burns the grass
[51:48] or either freezes it or whatever he
[51:50] wants to do with it
[51:52] wouldn't you buy down worship
[51:57] come on
[51:58] a whole lot more than you told them
[51:59] polar bears doing
[52:03] you see what it means then to call down
[52:05] fire out of heaven it doesn't mean that
[52:07] they're calling fire down
[52:10] those two witnesses the word from their
[52:12] mouth is like fire
[52:14] to devour their enemy
[52:17] the words of america can take down a
[52:19] nation
[52:22] that's it
[52:23] when they send to you in meetings you
[52:25] know they send supposed to send so many
[52:27] from each country
[52:29] but we're already number one there on
[52:31] the ground before anybody else lands
[52:35] why because we're policing the world
[52:40] but yet each nation just keeps coming up
[52:41] and we're showing you how brother brown
[52:43] said
[52:44] how that those ten toes and the kingdoms
[52:46] and the things
[52:47] you know
[52:50] he said they're dictators
[52:52] he said where's these dictators lean
[52:53] they said they lean automatically to
[52:55] communism
[52:56] we take a country we put a man in and we
[53:00] give him everything in the world
[53:02] and about the time he gets his head big
[53:04] enough
[53:05] like castro and then was educated here
[53:07] in america
[53:09] what i heard he was actually a
[53:13] there's puritan girl thing engagement
[53:15] right now but our knowledge
[53:18] i don't understand that or maybe the the
[53:20] military kind
[53:21] right
[53:22] but still what happened he turned to
[53:24] communism
[53:26] taking all we gave him but then he
[53:28] turned to communism
[53:31] more demons more devils
[53:34] we were trying to be nice
[53:36] you see calling down fire out of heaven
[53:38] is not a fire-breathing dragon
[53:41] blowing smoke right
[53:43] it's a bunch of preachers in the book
[53:45] it's much more
[53:46] amen
[53:48] out of their mouth
[53:50] because they captivate the people and
[53:52] they control them
[53:54] but yet this beast the first one comes
[53:57] out as we read in the first of the
[53:58] beginning of chapter 13.
[54:01] he comes up and i said want to go out of
[54:02] the ocean to see the people came from
[54:05] europe brought around them even said
[54:09] coming over here but this one raises up
[54:10] out of the land
[54:14] raises up out of the land
[54:17] out of the earth
[54:19] where there was no people see we came
[54:21] over here sure we found the indian but
[54:23] as i said while ago that wasn't to be
[54:25] counted in the religious atmosphere
[54:28] all right
[54:29] but you see what it was doing
[54:31] you see what we come across here and it
[54:33] begins to set a stage
[54:40] you know
[54:41] if we believe in the ark
[54:44] was the dove and the crow
[54:47] why would you worry about what i said
[54:49] about the
[54:50] nina and potento and i can't even name
[54:52] them kids
[54:54] you're supposed to learn that thing
[54:59] but do you think all that was good
[55:00] people
[55:03] do you honestly think that they sent all
[55:05] the good people over here
[55:07] no that was two or three loads later
[55:09] they began to send some good ones
[55:11] you sent the garbage
[55:14] you know
[55:15] they wouldn't the others wasn't mean
[55:16] enough to be able to fight and die for
[55:17] the freedom we were gonna have so they
[55:19] sent the crooks first
[55:21] right
[55:23] now come on church it's honestly true
[55:26] right
[55:28] but yet we've come to america and what a
[55:30] wonderful land
[55:32] but you know the problem with us
[55:35] you think about it
[55:37] we're every day voting away our own
[55:39] freedom
[55:43] because you've got to get control of the
[55:45] american people through the mind
[55:48] you cannot force american people they
[55:49] got too many guns and things you can't
[55:52] control them that way
[55:54] you control them with their mind
[55:57] because that was what adam and eve was
[56:00] facing
[56:01] that's what all mankind has had to face
[56:04] intelligence
[56:07] look in america what is the greatest
[56:09] thing now this is the one thing that i
[56:11] see that is one of the greatest images
[56:14] to the beast and i say it's in the
[56:16] message people greater than anywhere
[56:18] else
[56:21] you think about this statement of fixing
[56:23] to make
[56:27] you know when we organize religion we
[56:29] would quote what so-and-so said about
[56:31] something when i was fine
[56:34] we would quote the scholars
[56:37] but everybody kind of had a little idea
[56:39] you know
[56:42] but when brother branham came along and
[56:45] began to speak the word of god to the
[56:47] people
[56:50] that formed into
[56:52] the people of this message what
[56:54] something i've always looked at
[56:56] that is very very damaging
[57:02] and you better listen to what i'm saying
[57:03] because you're misunderstanding
[57:06] the ability for you to be able to read
[57:08] this message
[57:11] is wonderful
[57:16] right
[57:18] do you realize what that's formed also
[57:22] eve is standing again with her ideas
[57:27] because you can tell people of this
[57:29] message run around said so but he also
[57:31] said
[57:35] making a contradiction out of it
[57:41] i've done preach to you then back under
[57:43] a few weeks ago
[57:46] on compound meaning but not compound or
[57:49] different revelations
[57:50] come into the same scripture
[57:53] you can't see a trinity in me see one
[57:55] god and say we're both in the bible
[57:58] right
[57:59] neither can we do it in this message
[58:04] i want you to read the message because
[58:06] if you don't know the message you don't
[58:08] know whether i'm telling you the truth
[58:10] or not that's right amen
[58:14] what are you going to judge it on your
[58:15] idea
[58:17] because of some face making that i do or
[58:20] something that you wouldn't like it
[58:23] you know some wording that i would say
[58:26] that you're offensive to me
[58:29] what does all that got to do with the
[58:30] gospel right
[58:33] you know when jesus called him a bunch
[58:35] of snakes
[58:36] i did tickle him to death did he
[58:41] you know they weren't killing him about
[58:43] it
[58:45] but you see church what i'm trying to
[58:46] say is the the biggest image of the
[58:49] beast to me is going to come out of this
[58:50] nation
[58:52] the biggest apex whatever you call it
[58:55] height amen
[58:58] and you know what i'm saying is true i
[59:00] read something here to you
[59:04] and sitting there watching some of you
[59:05] in your mind and some of you take your
[59:07] pin and start writing
[59:12] i said well
[59:14] they're not agreeing
[59:18] and they're writing down what brother
[59:20] brown said on another quote
[59:24] but just remember
[59:28] you can't have contradictions
[59:30] that's right
[59:35] lower meaning higher meaning
[59:37] compound meaning the prophet said even
[59:39] compound revelation he would say but not
[59:42] different meanings or different
[59:43] revelations
[59:51] one message
[59:54] 969 different denominations formed out
[59:56] of one message one bible
[59:58] how many of you got in this message
[1:00:00] right i mean
[1:00:05] that's right
[1:00:07] i believe we are the i believe we are
[1:00:09] the total apex of that situation
[1:00:12] because we're back like it was in the
[1:00:14] garden right
[1:00:16] as i said a moment ago we're back to i
[1:00:18] think
[1:00:21] i said well brother so-and-so said
[1:00:23] so-and-so
[1:00:24] you don't understand all he said
[1:00:28] yeah
[1:00:29] no but i know what i say
[1:00:34] i mean his brother mark turned around
[1:00:35] and said brother dale is a pink elephant
[1:00:37] out in the yard
[1:00:39] there might not be no peak elephant
[1:00:42] and there might not be no elephant in
[1:00:44] the yard but i know what he's saying
[1:00:47] he told me there's a pico
[1:00:52] if this prophet couldn't keep it
[1:00:54] straight we better be trying to find
[1:00:56] another one
[1:00:58] right right
[1:00:59] but i don't believe it i believe he kept
[1:01:01] it straight
[1:01:04] but my ideas or your ideas about it can
[1:01:07] form the image of the beast that's right
[1:01:10] amen
[1:01:13] and make us
[1:01:15] the very epic apex of all things
[1:01:20] and see once you see the image of the
[1:01:21] beast that's what i'm trying to lay down
[1:01:23] it's very simple to see the mark of the
[1:01:25] beast
[1:01:30] if you see the image of the beast is an
[1:01:32] exact likeness
[1:01:37] it's very easy to find out what the mark
[1:01:39] of the beast is
[1:01:44] and i'm going to repeat this about three
[1:01:46] times in this one message all right
[1:01:50] i like to do that for your thing
[1:01:54] you know we talk about the mark of the
[1:01:56] beast
[1:02:00] we used to believe it was some kind of
[1:02:01] tattoo some kind of something that was
[1:02:03] done
[1:02:07] we used to think it was communism
[1:02:12] we try to make it ever
[1:02:14] ungodly flame that flies up
[1:02:22] but remember it's got to be very close
[1:02:29] you realize in ezekiel
[1:02:36] it gives you a very good clue to
[1:02:38] the mark of the beast
[1:02:44] in ezekiel it speaks of a man with a
[1:02:46] writer's ink horn
[1:02:48] right
[1:02:50] he needs to go through the land
[1:02:53] and mark
[1:02:57] those who sigh and cry
[1:03:00] for the abomination done in the city
[1:03:04] the prophet one day said now you want to
[1:03:06] know what the evidence of the holy ghost
[1:03:08] is
[1:03:11] you don't hear this quote a lot do you
[1:03:13] he says if you want to know what the
[1:03:15] evidence of the holy ghost is he says
[1:03:17] whether or not
[1:03:18] you're crying and sign
[1:03:21] for the abomination is done in the city
[1:03:23] amen
[1:03:25] i preached that probably 35 40 years ago
[1:03:27] we're not talking about washington d.c
[1:03:29] right right because the prophet said i
[1:03:31] don't pray for that anymore
[1:03:33] okay
[1:03:35] i think that it's talking about in this
[1:03:37] city that you and i are associated in
[1:03:40] called a message
[1:03:45] do you ever just pray for these people
[1:03:47] that are so confused
[1:03:51] or do you damn them with your words
[1:03:56] right you condemn them
[1:04:01] and say they're lost
[1:04:04] what would you do in the days of martin
[1:04:06] luther
[1:04:07] with the ideas you have of organized
[1:04:09] religion and seeing martin luther had
[1:04:12] every one of those traits
[1:04:15] the yeti was the man of god and the word
[1:04:17] of the hour was through the man
[1:04:22] what would you do
[1:04:27] you know i love god for being the way he
[1:04:29] is
[1:04:34] and i try to illustrate it like if
[1:04:36] if we were going to commit way to the
[1:04:38] lord for some problem he had
[1:04:43] everybody said we'll just turn him over
[1:04:45] to the devil
[1:04:47] that ain't in the bible
[1:04:49] and ain't the prophet's message
[1:04:51] what it is see there's that quote
[1:04:53] writing it down quit right that's when
[1:04:55] you fight against it yeah
[1:04:58] quote from what
[1:05:02] how can you commit anybody to the devil
[1:05:05] by whose authority
[1:05:07] do you commit anybody to the devil
[1:05:11] that kind of sounds like catholicism
[1:05:13] don't it
[1:05:17] excommunicating
[1:05:24] see i knew that that wasn't right
[1:05:26] because i'd be in pastor i knew i maybe
[1:05:27] someday would have to face that
[1:05:29] situation
[1:05:31] of having to do something in the order
[1:05:33] of that
[1:05:36] i've done a lot of searching until i
[1:05:38] found a prophet
[1:05:40] he said we turn him over to god
[1:05:43] he turns him over to the devil
[1:05:45] that took the load off my back and i
[1:05:49] i was hurried to find that right
[1:05:51] because if i ever had to use it then i'd
[1:05:53] realize that hey wait just a minute now
[1:05:57] if we're committing wade to the lord
[1:06:02] then the lord take care of him
[1:06:08] what i've always wondered is we're over
[1:06:10] here at the church and we're committing
[1:06:11] way to the devil
[1:06:14] you know
[1:06:15] let's just meet together turn him loose
[1:06:17] to the devil
[1:06:19] and he's over the house repenting
[1:06:22] now what kind of a situation have you
[1:06:23] got
[1:06:27] and he's even saying lord forgive them
[1:06:29] people for what they're doing over the
[1:06:30] church right now
[1:06:32] now which one is god going to hear
[1:06:37] but if we turn him over to the lord and
[1:06:39] he's over the house god's working on
[1:06:41] both ends
[1:06:47] you see church
[1:06:51] what we used to think was word
[1:06:56] we have found out that it was grandma's
[1:06:58] idea
[1:07:01] i don't mean that against grandma
[1:07:06] but to see that that
[1:07:08] image of the beast
[1:07:11] would come down to finally be the mark
[1:07:13] of the beast
[1:07:18] the prophet of god they asked you one
[1:07:19] time about the mark of the beast he said
[1:07:21] if you don't have the baptism of the
[1:07:23] holy ghost
[1:07:25] that's what i'm quoting from he said
[1:07:27] you're already marked
[1:07:29] right yep
[1:07:31] but we're looking for some stamp some
[1:07:33] way some hands i'm doing
[1:07:38] instead of thinking
[1:07:44] brother random
[1:07:46] the mark of the beast
[1:07:48] he said it's the mark
[1:07:51] of apostasy
[1:07:55] i watch him
[1:07:57] not outwardly
[1:08:02] but inwardly
[1:08:03] that's right
[1:08:05] now
[1:08:07] if the writers ate corn that he was
[1:08:09] marking the people who signed and cried
[1:08:13] where did he mark them at according to
[1:08:14] the bible
[1:08:19] he barked them in their forehead
[1:08:24] well why was we looking for tattoos in
[1:08:26] the forehead right well what we'd look
[1:08:28] for is we'd look at warning now 666 but
[1:08:30] now jesus wrote on the edge or something
[1:08:33] is that the way we'd be looking
[1:08:36] and then you could just buy you a couple
[1:08:37] of tattoos and stick them on where you
[1:08:39] wanted them today because you know they
[1:08:41] got them kind you just roll up there and
[1:08:42] you can peel it right off you know so if
[1:08:44] i was around this group i just put one
[1:08:46] there
[1:08:47] another one
[1:08:49] i could just be whatever i want to be to
[1:08:51] everybody
[1:08:57] so the image to the beast
[1:09:00] is a doctrinal ideas of the
[1:09:04] catholic church hands down through
[1:09:06] protestantism
[1:09:08] right
[1:09:09] the mark of the beast is
[1:09:11] your very intelligence that you have
[1:09:13] right
[1:09:15] the doctrines
[1:09:17] now see i know you're writing it down
[1:09:19] now
[1:09:21] okay so that little computer's already
[1:09:23] started working he said don't wait just
[1:09:25] a minute i got him
[1:09:29] i like it that way
[1:09:32] i like to expose you because i already
[1:09:35] got exposed
[1:09:37] you know
[1:09:41] how many of you thought about what i was
[1:09:43] saying that
[1:09:44] that i was inferring that the baptism of
[1:09:46] the holy ghost is in your forehead
[1:09:52] you know everybody's saying no
[1:09:55] i hope that's true
[1:09:57] i was baptized by the holy ghost and not
[1:09:59] in your forehead
[1:10:06] but the bible see
[1:10:09] would be too close to
[1:10:12] where you couldn't get confused
[1:10:14] if the bible says
[1:10:16] that the writer's ink horn was marked on
[1:10:18] his soul
[1:10:21] right
[1:10:22] there wouldn't be no deception being
[1:10:24] able to come out of that
[1:10:29] it would be the ability to think well
[1:10:31] you know really the holy ghost just to
[1:10:32] my
[1:10:33] my brain
[1:10:35] that's the spirit
[1:10:37] uh won't work out folks
[1:10:40] but it is odd that the holy ghost is the
[1:10:43] seal of god
[1:10:44] he's in your forehead
[1:10:51] but at the same time the mark of the
[1:10:54] beast is in your forehead
[1:10:58] that's your intelligence
[1:11:01] right
[1:11:02] i thought lord this is not a six or
[1:11:04] seven thing for me to talk about
[1:11:06] to a group of people that already knows
[1:11:07] that it's not 666
[1:11:09] they already know that it's not just
[1:11:12] some mark or number or something do it
[1:11:15] they already studied the message many of
[1:11:17] them for 40 50 years
[1:11:20] and they know that it's
[1:11:22] not just an image mark in the forehead
[1:11:26] it's a doctrinal idea
[1:11:31] that's why i love the scripture we just
[1:11:33] read
[1:11:37] because what's the difference in
[1:11:42] the name
[1:11:48] let's see if i can find it read it again
[1:12:00] in other words it names three things
[1:12:02] verse 18 talks about 17 18 no
[1:12:05] that no man might buy or sell say he
[1:12:08] that had to mark right
[1:12:12] or
[1:12:16] the name of the beast
[1:12:19] we could have either one right right so
[1:12:21] it's not a statute not tattoo
[1:12:23] 666
[1:12:26] or the number of his name all right
[1:12:32] it's not it can be any of those three
[1:12:36] because all three are the same thing
[1:12:41] if you have a person's doctrine you have
[1:12:43] their name
[1:12:47] that's why this message people are quick
[1:12:49] to say who do you follow
[1:12:54] right
[1:12:56] you heard this one what camp are you in
[1:13:01] you in the two soul camp you in the
[1:13:03] seven country versus camp you're in the
[1:13:05] cruise you can't wait which camp are you
[1:13:07] in
[1:13:08] i said well they've tried to put me in
[1:13:10] every one of them that i get thrown out
[1:13:12] of all of them
[1:13:14] well i reckon i'm a vagabond
[1:13:19] i just don't have no count
[1:13:22] he said well you got your own doctrine
[1:13:24] hey man a church without a doctrine
[1:13:25] can't be a church
[1:13:27] okay come on show me where we missed it
[1:13:29] now right
[1:13:31] that's out there on the internet
[1:13:33] show me where we're off the message here
[1:13:38] that's what around the world
[1:13:41] but the phone don't ring
[1:13:45] because they know what i'm saying is the
[1:13:47] truth
[1:13:51] whether you've got a tattoo in your
[1:13:52] forehead or the backside of your head or
[1:13:54] in your earlobes or
[1:13:56] inside the roof of your mouth or
[1:13:58] whatever that ain't going to be no
[1:14:00] doing
[1:14:02] what not having on them
[1:14:05] the bible says don't put no marks
[1:14:10] don't put no marks don't get no tattoos
[1:14:14] you wind up covering them up one time
[1:14:18] trying to because you put them on there
[1:14:20] in stupidity
[1:14:21] you know you know maybe i'm mean for
[1:14:23] saying that but god just makes it to
[1:14:24] where you can't erase your stupidity
[1:14:28] you have to repent
[1:14:30] right that's the only erasing there is
[1:14:32] to stupidity
[1:14:33] is repent
[1:14:35] and say i'm sorry for doing that right
[1:14:38] but now listen
[1:14:40] brother branham on the message hearing
[1:14:43] receiving and that acting
[1:14:46] he calls it carnal esau
[1:14:50] now why would brother brown call the
[1:14:51] mark of the beast carnal esau
[1:14:57] all the way around esau was a pretty
[1:14:59] good guy
[1:15:00] that's right
[1:15:03] right right
[1:15:04] better guy on his brother
[1:15:08] we call it corn esau
[1:15:12] because you know what esau done
[1:15:15] he sold his birthright
[1:15:22] if we don't have the baptism of the holy
[1:15:24] ghost we've already sold our birthright
[1:15:26] because it's here for us
[1:15:28] all right
[1:15:31] he said well i don't know how to worry
[1:15:33] you could do that you want the quote
[1:15:34] from wrote a random word a priest
[1:15:37] or a pope
[1:15:39] i'll tell you his name in a minute but
[1:15:41] the holy ghost tried to come on him
[1:15:45] and he rejected him
[1:15:51] holy ghost tried to come on him
[1:15:55] and he rejected it
[1:15:59] he was the one that wrote the decree
[1:16:00] that was better to kill people trying to
[1:16:02] make them serve god than it was to let
[1:16:04] him die without being something done to
[1:16:07] him you know
[1:16:08] he killed millions of people
[1:16:12] he come out with that idea because he
[1:16:14] rejected the holy ghost right
[1:16:19] right
[1:16:22] see church we're looking for something
[1:16:23] to happen
[1:16:28] and it's already happened among us
[1:16:32] the mark of the beast right
[1:16:38] it's not a 666
[1:16:41] yet you can take it and go down we will
[1:16:44] later probably
[1:16:45] where's my carriage billy idi
[1:16:48] you can do it with your roman numerals
[1:16:50] and
[1:16:51] come out to be 666. that's right
[1:16:54] like i said you can figure your name out
[1:16:55] and it might come out according what how
[1:16:57] you balance the book
[1:16:59] you know what i mean by that which way
[1:17:00] you do the numbers which way you spell
[1:17:02] things and whose book you use to write
[1:17:04] it by
[1:17:10] which church
[1:17:12] the catholic doctrine
[1:17:14] it's what we better be afraid of right
[1:17:17] now
[1:17:17] probably said don't fear communism
[1:17:21] he said there's no place in the bible
[1:17:23] that said russia will never rule the
[1:17:24] world
[1:17:26] right oh quote now how many wrote down
[1:17:28] him and he started a computer right then
[1:17:31] but around said
[1:17:33] russia will destroy us that's exactly
[1:17:34] right
[1:17:35] he said they got a bomb waiting for the
[1:17:37] vatican
[1:17:38] then bombs wait for us
[1:17:41] but that don't mean rule the world in a
[1:17:43] religious realm
[1:17:51] what is the mark of the beast to reject
[1:17:54] the holy spirit
[1:17:59] if you don't accept the holy spirit
[1:18:01] you're already marked right that's the
[1:18:03] truth
[1:18:06] these babies back here
[1:18:08] these kids
[1:18:10] and you teach them the best you can
[1:18:13] but you know what they are
[1:18:16] and that's where people don't like me
[1:18:20] they're not born again
[1:18:24] sure they're under the age of
[1:18:25] accountability and that's not counting
[1:18:27] then okay because that's what it means
[1:18:28] accountability
[1:18:31] and all babies who die under the age of
[1:18:32] accountability the prophet said
[1:18:34] automatically go to heaven
[1:18:36] all right
[1:18:37] but once they reach the age of
[1:18:38] accountability
[1:18:41] they have the mark of the beast that's
[1:18:43] an automatic process
[1:18:45] it's not something you have to work up
[1:18:46] to get
[1:18:48] if you were born in the back woods of
[1:18:51] africa
[1:18:52] and never been out from under a tree
[1:18:56] you're still the same way
[1:19:00] or the most educated people in the world
[1:19:03] that would all that mama and daddy would
[1:19:05] do is say jesus jesus jesus all their
[1:19:07] life
[1:19:09] they're still
[1:19:12] born in this domain marked with the mark
[1:19:15] of the beast
[1:19:18] that's why he said go through it
[1:19:21] acorn and change it
[1:19:25] so where did he start to change from
[1:19:29] beforehand
[1:19:32] working in the very position
[1:19:35] that
[1:19:37] satan works from
[1:19:42] you know
[1:19:43] it's hard to understand god
[1:19:46] you know
[1:19:48] how did god ever drop down through
[1:19:52] your thinking ability
[1:19:54] that was trained wrong all of your life
[1:19:58] taught a trinity taught all kind of
[1:20:00] things
[1:20:02] and dropped down in there and clean that
[1:20:05] soul and give you the new birth
[1:20:08] you're talking about a miracle
[1:20:10] that is a miracle amen
[1:20:12] that's right prophet said a baby being
[1:20:14] born not a miracle
[1:20:17] but the new birth
[1:20:21] what you see in that forehead is the
[1:20:24] ability to receive
[1:20:28] that's why i love the scriptures because
[1:20:30] the bible says when jesus was teaching
[1:20:33] them you know about the kingdom
[1:20:35] he said they took the word and held it
[1:20:39] now they weren't born again
[1:20:42] jesus hadn't died yet
[1:20:46] so they took the word and held it right
[1:20:49] and on the day of pentecost the holy
[1:20:51] ghost came upon that word that held
[1:20:53] right
[1:20:54] but what about the other stories of how
[1:20:56] the carers of life and etcetera and this
[1:20:57] that and the other took away the thing
[1:20:59] that you
[1:21:00] had heard
[1:21:04] because we're automatic you don't have
[1:21:06] to be
[1:21:07] i
[1:21:08] i preached a member of message years ago
[1:21:10] called the pawn shop
[1:21:13] and we say the devil put us in the pawn
[1:21:15] shop
[1:21:16] okay that's because of the fall
[1:21:19] we put our own self in the pawnshop
[1:21:24] why because we started the doctrine
[1:21:27] teaching our children
[1:21:29] how many of you taught your children to
[1:21:30] sing
[1:21:31] father son and holy ghost blessed
[1:21:34] trinity
[1:21:43] we taught our children
[1:21:46] we taught them about the doctrines and
[1:21:48] the ideas
[1:21:52] and then we wonder how did they get that
[1:21:54] way
[1:21:58] it's because we talk
[1:22:02] you know so we know what we've got to do
[1:22:06] i've got to touch that head say
[1:22:09] susan
[1:22:10] i'm talking to you
[1:22:13] i gotta hit that head and get that
[1:22:15] forehead part where your intelligence is
[1:22:17] at to get you to listen if not you're
[1:22:20] gonna sit there and blank me out and
[1:22:22] you're gonna figure out how to
[1:22:24] feed the dogs
[1:22:28] or how you can pull some over on donny
[1:22:30] to get you a new ring
[1:22:34] and you're grinning at me and shaking
[1:22:35] your head
[1:22:38] that's why shaking your head is a good
[1:22:40] way to be all right but shaking your
[1:22:42] head ain't amen
[1:22:45] that could be sleepy
[1:22:50] brother used to sit up here on the front
[1:22:52] row years ago come on musician i gotta
[1:22:54] quit
[1:22:56] brother you sit up here on the front row
[1:22:57] years ago and he crossed his leg
[1:23:00] and you could preach to him and he'd go
[1:23:02] his floor to go down
[1:23:05] he'd come up his foot and come up
[1:23:07] he'd go down his foot and go down
[1:23:09] and he'd sit there and do it i never
[1:23:11] didn't figure out which one was okay
[1:23:13] he was late he was double a man in me
[1:23:15] that's whatever i think
[1:23:18] that's why i like somebody to say amen
[1:23:24] now i have said amen
[1:23:27] when a few words later i was saying oh
[1:23:30] me
[1:23:31] because i found out what the person was
[1:23:33] talking about
[1:23:35] so i conned the phrase around here cause
[1:23:37] someone did one night with a fellowship
[1:23:40] meeting and someone jumped me on the way
[1:23:41] home
[1:23:43] he said you said amen when that guy said
[1:23:45] sort of
[1:23:46] i said i am in the first half
[1:23:49] i didn't aim in the whole statement
[1:23:52] that was the rest of the statement was
[1:23:54] wrong
[1:23:55] but you see church
[1:23:58] if you don't take nothing out of this
[1:23:59] mission take one time
[1:24:03] the mark of the beast is in your
[1:24:05] forehead amen
[1:24:07] right
[1:24:07] but the seal of god has to work through
[1:24:10] that same for him
[1:24:14] that's the only entrance to the soul
[1:24:18] what do you think it says faith cometh
[1:24:21] by what
[1:24:25] amen
[1:24:27] how can we hear without a preacher
[1:24:33] you see
[1:24:37] because what i'm trying my best to do is
[1:24:40] to destroy
[1:24:41] our human intelligence
[1:24:45] that has taught us the wrong way
[1:24:48] amen
[1:24:53] see because it controls us
[1:24:56] like i've told you
[1:24:58] they always talk and said that nobody
[1:25:00] could break them what let us now make
[1:25:01] sure i get this right four minute mile
[1:25:04] nobody could break the four minute mile
[1:25:08] that was a
[1:25:09] set thing you know
[1:25:13] well you know a boy was born and had a
[1:25:15] lot of problems with his legs and things
[1:25:18] he said he wasn't even able to be able
[1:25:20] to walk
[1:25:22] you know he pressured pushed and walked
[1:25:27] he started running
[1:25:31] and you know what they forgot to tell
[1:25:32] him
[1:25:35] the four-minute mile was impossible
[1:25:39] you know what he done he broke it
[1:25:43] didn't it odd that a bumblebee
[1:25:46] scientifically
[1:25:47] cannot fly
[1:25:49] but you know you go out there and you
[1:25:51] tell that bumblebee all you want to
[1:25:58] why
[1:25:59] because he ain't gonna listen to you
[1:26:03] when this bride begins to get to the
[1:26:05] bases here we're not gonna listen to
[1:26:06] man's ideas
[1:26:10] we're going to take the prophet's
[1:26:11] message
[1:26:13] and we're okay we we love to take it in
[1:26:15] the book of revelations about images and
[1:26:18] beasts and things
[1:26:20] what about all of it
[1:26:22] and we're willing to eat the whole book
[1:26:28] but do we have the mark of the beast
[1:26:32] you realize that we've got to get that
[1:26:34] mark of the beast out of her
[1:26:35] intelligence i hope you understand what
[1:26:37] i'm getting at baby i know it's been a
[1:26:39] hard way of saying
[1:26:41] martin luther
[1:26:42] had in his soul the baptism of the holy
[1:26:45] ghost which is eternal life which is the
[1:26:48] same eternal life you have today if you
[1:26:50] have the baptism with the holy ghost you
[1:26:52] agree with that
[1:26:53] but his intelligence
[1:26:57] in his forehead was catholicism right
[1:26:59] absolutely
[1:27:02] some way caught dropped through there
[1:27:04] down into that slowly from out of that
[1:27:06] soul scream to man
[1:27:07] the judge shall live by faith
[1:27:13] he could have never done it up here
[1:27:14] that's right amen go tell him how many
[1:27:17] times he read that scripture
[1:27:19] but he couldn't do it up here
[1:27:22] you and i can't do it up here right
[1:27:24] that's right
[1:27:27] preach to the soul amen
[1:27:30] let the soul decide what's going on
[1:27:33] what do we got in this team 5 39 and
[1:27:35] spiral books
[1:27:52] within me
[1:28:10] within me
[1:28:26] is
[1:28:44] me
[1:29:24] away
[1:29:51] in
[1:30:08] me
[1:30:25] me
[1:30:58] me
