[0:00] uh the size of the city the walls the
[0:03] different things but we just want to
[0:05] pick a little few things along in
[0:06] Revelations 21 and 22 tonight and just
[0:10] speak a little about it and then try to
[0:12] bring this series to a close I think
[0:14] it's about 93 messages so at least we
[0:18] ought to know a little bit about the
[0:20] Book of Revelations if nothing else we
[0:22] ought to know verse one all right
[0:25] because we've read that for all of that
[0:27] time and we'll read it again tonight
[0:29] amen
[0:30] uh remember brother Bob black this
[0:32] coming weekend uh there'll be an
[0:34] earthquake down along about the the 400
[0:39] as he starts towards Alabama I'm sure if
[0:42] he's watching now he's laughing cuz he's
[0:44] going to be preaching the Lord willing
[0:45] over at brother Matthew brayes this
[0:48] coming weekend so just be much in prayer
[0:50] for him that the Lord would would bless
[0:52] him he'll take care of him remember
[0:53] brother Bray preached here back what it
[0:55] was in January I guess somewhere in
[0:57] there but he's going to be speaking for
[1:00] for him there so we pray that the Lord
[1:02] would bless him and everything and and
[1:05] if any of you want to run to Alabama to
[1:07] hear him he's in Mobil Alabama so I'm
[1:10] sure he would appreciate you doing if
[1:12] not pray for him that's the main thing
[1:15] okay and remember the fellowship meeting
[1:17] will be here on the third Saturday we
[1:20] had announced it to be up at brother Tom
[1:23] cranes but he wanted not to have it this
[1:25] time so we will will the Lord willing be
[1:27] having it fellowship meeting here May
[1:29] the 18th so remember that and be much in
[1:32] prayer of May the 3rd Saturday of May
[1:35] any other announcements I generally
[1:37] forget something that you know okay so
[1:42] Revelations 1 and Revelations 21 heavly
[1:46] father we thank you Lord for your love
[1:47] and your grace unto us and truly father
[1:50] as we've just got through saying we
[1:53] could spend another year or two
[1:55] preaching off of this Revelations 21 and
[1:58] 22 go all at that we've said all of the
[2:01] days of 92
[2:03] sermons is buil up to the place of
[2:06] understanding where we're going to not a
[2:09] happy hunting ground but a a land lord a
[2:13] time a wonderful
[2:16] opportunity and we've seen the things
[2:18] and we pray that you would just bless us
[2:20] and give understanding to us and Lord
[2:22] just have your way with us and guide us
[2:25] now as we read your word you come and
[2:28] speak to us Lord
[2:30] guide us in Jesus name amen Revelations
[2:36] 1 says the revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:40] which God gave unto him to show unto his
[2:42] servants things which must shortly come
[2:44] to pass and he sent and signified it by
[2:47] his Angel unto his servant John who by
[2:50] record of the word of God under the
[2:52] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[2:55] things that he saw blessed is he that
[2:58] readeth and he they that hear the the
[2:59] words or the pro this prophecy and keep
[3:02] those things which are written therein
[3:04] for the time is at hand
[3:09] now I didn't spend much time in it
[3:12] speaking about the things but remember
[3:15] this is the only book in the Bible
[3:18] whereas the Lord Jesus Christ himself
[3:21] coming personally to John to write so
[3:24] when it says he sent an angel and watch
[3:26] that real careful I won't go into it but
[3:29] get over into chapter 22 and watch your
[3:32] red letter edition part of who's talking
[3:35] uh I believe I don't believe as some
[3:38] people believe in the message that
[3:40] brother randam came to John on patmas to
[3:42] bring the Revelation I I don't believe
[3:44] that now I just honest that it get too
[3:46] much into
[3:48] pre-existence and it would be putting
[3:50] too much emphasis I believe that was the
[3:53] prophet the Lord Jesus Christ that came
[3:56] to John on patmas and sure he would send
[3:58] an angel or he'd come himself so you
[4:01] have to be careful which way and John
[4:03] falls down to worship and he says don't
[4:05] worship me or I I don't believe that's
[4:08] brother brand and I you know I'm just
[4:10] honest if it is I'm I I I just say it
[4:13] and you know that I don't believe it is
[4:16] because of too much emphasis would be
[4:18] put upon him and not upon all of the
[4:21] prophets and besides the Lord Jesus
[4:24] Christ is the prophet so that would be
[4:27] the one the son of man and you'll get
[4:29] over The Book of Revelations 22 and find
[4:31] him there in dealing with the doings but
[4:34] yet still we believe that God did send a
[4:37] prophet and brought us a message and
[4:39] thank God for it I believe he was a
[4:41] messenger to this age amen you know I
[4:44] believe he's a messenger of this age
[4:46] right I believe he was the one that
[4:48] delivered the message to you and I and
[4:50] how much more emphasis could I give upon
[4:52] it than that to give understanding all
[4:56] let's go to Revelation
[4:58] 21
[5:00] and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth
[5:02] for the first Heaven and the first Earth
[5:04] were passed away and there was no more
[5:06] sea and now John saw the holy city New
[5:09] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[5:11] Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[5:13] her husband and I heard a great voice
[5:16] out of Heaven saying behold the
[5:17] Tabernacle of God is with men and he
[5:20] shall dwell with them and they shall be
[5:22] his people and God himself shall be with
[5:24] them and be their God and God shall wipe
[5:27] away all tears from their
[5:30] eyes and there shall be no more death
[5:33] neither sorrow nor crying neither shall
[5:35] there be any more pain for the former
[5:37] things are passed
[5:39] away and he that sat upon the throne
[5:41] said behold I make all things new and he
[5:44] said unto me right for these words are
[5:47] true and faithful and he said unto me it
[5:50] is done I am Alpha and Omega the
[5:51] beginning and the end I will give unto
[5:54] him that is the thirst of the Fountain
[5:55] of the Water of Life freely he that
[5:58] overcometh shall inherit at all things
[6:01] and I will be his God and he shall be my
[6:05] son you may be seated to the Lord at his
[6:07] Blessing to the reading of the word
[6:13] now as I said now I don't want to spend
[6:15] a lot of time talking about the future
[6:18] home because the message is there for
[6:20] you to read it to understand the uh
[6:23] building understand the things what I
[6:26] want to do is to try tonight to speak
[6:29] and I don't if you know if you seen my
[6:31] notes all the brothers has got is is
[6:34] some uh scriptures and all I've got
[6:37] written down is scriptures so it would
[6:39] be basically speaking from my thoughts
[6:42] of what I believe the Lord would give me
[6:45] to speak to you about it and uh you know
[6:47] to try to end up this part of the doing
[6:51] because as I said I I could preach six
[6:53] months off of there in Revelations 1
[6:56] because see if we don't have a personal
[7:00] revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ
[7:03] we're not going to go in the chains of
[7:05] the body now we can go by the grave and
[7:08] be true Christians and come up and we'll
[7:11] be there and have a Rapture time and a
[7:13] change sure but I'm wanting to be one of
[7:17] those that will be there to where that
[7:19] they'll be changed in a moment of
[7:20] Twinkle of an eye amen that's why where
[7:22] our thought for tonight will be out of
[7:25] verse five where he says I make all
[7:28] things
[7:30] new
[7:31] amen now he didn't say I'll make new
[7:38] things right he said to make all things
[7:42] new all right now brother random a lot
[7:45] of times will
[7:46] say I'm going to get a new
[7:50] body well I believe that right but then
[7:54] people will take that and and from that
[7:57] quote run it into the ground on the
[8:00] basis of that it's not this body we're
[8:03] going to get a new
[8:05] body well the word new is a a very um
[8:10] outstanding word and it can be used in
[8:13] many
[8:15] ways it's like saying in the beginning
[8:18] right well you know every second is in
[8:21] the beginning for somebody
[8:25] right because that's the beginning of
[8:27] the person all right but see when you
[8:29] say I make all things
[8:32] new now we know that from the message of
[8:37] the future home that it will not be a
[8:40] annihilation of this
[8:45] world but it will be an annihilation of
[8:48] all sin right amen that is upon the
[8:52] Earth right all right then see if it's
[8:56] not
[8:57] Annihilation but yet you could call it a
[9:00] new Earth y cuz the Bible will call it a
[9:03] new Earth amen right
[9:06] right it said there new
[9:10] Heavens but is it meaning that there's
[9:13] going to be a lot more
[9:16] created are we going to speak a world
[9:19] into existence and go out on it and live
[9:22] on
[9:24] it as arrogant and hateful as we all are
[9:28] we'd all have our own little old
[9:31] world and we would certainly be set up
[9:33] to where that we would never let our
[9:35] orbit Pace each other or what that word
[9:38] for it is where you spin around and stay
[9:40] in the orbit we make sure we didn't
[9:43] cross each
[9:44] other we life at that but it's pretty
[9:47] well true you
[9:49] know but now
[9:53] listen we saw this past
[9:56] Sunday that there's going to be a final
[10:00] battle to come upon the
[10:02] Earth amen that will be called The
[10:05] Battle of go and Magog right all right
[10:09] we gave the quotes from The Prophet
[10:11] showing you the battle of
[10:14] Armageddon is just prior to the
[10:16] millennial reign of the Thousand Years
[10:19] and Armageddon is after the Millennium
[10:23] so you got two different
[10:25] battles and the difference in what
[10:27] you're dealing with is like we were
[10:29] trying to bring out the other night that
[10:33] see in Armageddon things will be
[10:35] basically burned
[10:38] over right you know a cleansing yes amen
[10:41] but a burning over our our
[10:44] doings all right and there'll be things
[10:47] that will the world will remain to go
[10:50] through the millennial Reign and it'll
[10:52] be a great Utopia they in the Millennium
[10:55] for a thousand years but the devil is
[10:58] just bound dur in that period of time
[11:00] that's right amen so if he's bound his
[11:02] demons are bound all right we don't have
[11:05] to worry about none of them sneaking
[11:07] around and getting out and doing
[11:08] anything they'll all be taken care of
[11:11] and with him being bound they're
[11:15] bound right and in doing that then it
[11:18] will be a great time upon this
[11:21] Earth but yet there will be things a
[11:24] prophet said in the Millennium y that
[11:29] will not be in the future home that's
[11:31] right all right so then we must realize
[11:36] that what he's to saying is that you
[11:38] know something's going to take place and
[11:40] one is the top of the other right the
[11:44] seventh day out of Eden you know the
[11:47] creation the top of the millennial Reign
[11:51] all right we went through all of those
[11:52] things anybody on tape that just hears
[11:55] these go backwards a few Services you
[11:57] got 93 92 to choose from you'll surely
[12:00] find something
[12:03] but when it comes to Gog and
[12:08] Magog that will not only be a literal
[12:11] form of
[12:13] battle you know to anihilate things and
[12:16] germs and nuclear and all kind of things
[12:20] but we found it it would be a
[12:23] spiritual fire a burning of fire from
[12:25] God to even burn the devil up amen and
[12:28] he'll have his place in the Lake of Fire
[12:31] which is the second death and he will be
[12:34] destroyed amen you know all demons in
[12:37] that Gog and Magog will be annihilated
[12:42] because it'll have to go then as say
[12:44] some form of a battle that start and
[12:46] then this group of people will have to
[12:48] be moved over I don't know how to
[12:50] explain it but just simple language move
[12:53] them over into a lake of fire and
[12:56] they'll finally become extinct right cuz
[12:58] we don't believe in eternal hell we
[13:00] don't believe in Eternal Lake of Fire
[13:02] right amen we believe in a lake of fire
[13:04] that will burn forever and ever maybe
[13:06] millions of trillions of years but not
[13:09] Eternal because you'd have to have God's
[13:11] own life to live in hell or in the Lake
[13:14] of Fire and the purpose of the Lake of
[13:17] Fire is the second death which will
[13:20] destroy
[13:21] all people the souls or the
[13:25] individuals that do not make it into the
[13:30] uh time of what we would call the future
[13:31] home because there will be
[13:34] a white Throne judgment Y and people
[13:37] will be given eternal life at that white
[13:39] throne and then from there we go over to
[13:43] uh which will tie into the future home
[13:46] all right so then it'll be a spiritual
[13:51] cleansing getting rid of all demons and
[13:54] things and that's what I kept trying to
[13:56] emphasize I hope you was listening that
[13:59] WR around him on paragraph 334 of the
[14:01] for seal speaking of
[14:04] Armageddon he said Here Comes Satan with
[14:07] all four corners of the Earth with his
[14:09] Protestants and with his Catholics and
[14:12] all together marching right up to the
[14:14] battle of Armageddon right he didn't
[14:17] talk about Russia and China and this
[14:19] coming down we know that will take
[14:23] place we know there will be bombs as I
[14:26] said the prophet said there's a bomb
[14:28] waiting for the Vatican he said there's
[14:30] a bomb waiting for for the White House
[14:33] you know we know that will
[14:36] happen but the emphasis the prophet put
[14:38] on it on the fourth seal I ask you to go
[14:40] back and read that he didn't talk about
[14:43] Russia coming down in this country he
[14:45] said the forces would be coming would be
[14:47] Protestants and Catholics amen well
[14:51] what's going to be destroyed when it
[14:53] comes to Gog and
[14:56] Magog Protestants and Catholics
[15:00] right those demons that caus those
[15:04] things to come into being those
[15:06] doctrines and
[15:07] ideas will be annihilated or be
[15:09] destroyed not to just bind them or or
[15:12] put them in a place totally annihilated
[15:16] amen what about it all germs are could
[15:19] be
[15:19] annihilated a nuclear war could could
[15:22] annihilate a lot of germs but it bring
[15:25] more germs into being right right I
[15:28] don't know where be correct as far as
[15:29] you'd say germs germs going be destroyed
[15:31] but just get what I'm talking about it
[15:33] bring more sickness and problems but
[15:36] what about a time when it comes it all
[15:39] that'll be totally annihilated
[15:42] amen there won't be no sickness won't be
[15:44] no no jur no Graves the prophet said in
[15:47] that future home that's right it won't
[15:50] won't be there all right now cuz that is
[15:53] the second death all right then we
[15:57] covered and then we brought it up to
[15:59] just one little point and we covered
[16:01] where that we was reading Revelations
[16:04] 21 where it said I saw a new Heaven and
[16:08] a new Earth where the first Heaven and
[16:10] the first Earth were passed away and
[16:12] there was no more sea all right now the
[16:18] prophet has explained that in the future
[16:20] home
[16:21] message that this world as I said a
[16:24] while ago will not be annihilated it'll
[16:26] just be burned over and will be
[16:31] kept actually you don't find in the
[16:34] scriptures now if you watch a reading
[16:36] tonight you'll
[16:38] find uh new Heavens plural but it'll
[16:43] always be One Singular earth right amen
[16:46] I believe that's to
[16:48] emphasize because Heavens is dimensional
[16:52] situations and and parts like that more
[16:55] than it is uh you know anything else
[16:58] else and and if Satan has in any way uh
[17:02] been up anywhere and around and about
[17:05] you know uh that will have to be going
[17:07] through a change to cleanse it maybe
[17:10] that's the point of it say because it
[17:11] does say and we'll read in a minute new
[17:13] Heavens right amen and a new Earth it
[17:17] always will say Earth singular right why
[17:20] because this world this Earth is not
[17:22] going to be annihilated but it's going
[17:24] to be made new as I started while ago
[17:27] that's right it can be called a
[17:30] new why because it's not different see
[17:34] when we say new we think
[17:36] different but that's not the way the
[17:38] word is the word new is mean to just
[17:41] recreate the same thing back in the
[17:45] condition that it was when it was in the
[17:47] first condition amen all right see then
[17:51] that will tie together and and be all
[17:53] right see so we read there in the
[17:55] scripture you know where it says in the
[17:56] new first Heaven and the first
[17:59] Earth were passed away brother random on
[18:01] Satan's Eden said the first Heaven is
[18:04] the Millennium right that we're going to
[18:09] Y and the first Earth is now right now
[18:12] he said that's what it's talking about
[18:14] now there's heavens of Heavens the Bible
[18:16] speaks
[18:17] of right there's heavens and heavens and
[18:21] you know that Jesus said that the the
[18:23] Heaven and the Earth let's see what was
[18:26] that I just s back start pulling a few
[18:29] scriptures while ago and just thinking
[18:31] Matthew 24:35 said Heaven and Earth
[18:33] shall pass away but my words shall not
[18:37] pass away am he could speak of it like I
[18:41] said then there's heavens of Heavens
[18:42] atmospheres and are called heavens and
[18:45] dimensional
[18:46] situations so you're going to have to do
[18:48] away with the Fifth Dimension right are
[18:52] you listening The Fifth Dimension is
[18:55] where the sinner dead goes right is that
[18:57] true now according to to the prophet
[18:59] right so that'll have to be
[19:01] annihilated all right the fourth
[19:05] dimension is like demons traveling that
[19:08] will have to be annihilated right and
[19:11] see we living in the third dimension
[19:13] Life Light and matter so then Life Light
[19:16] and matter will be
[19:20] annihilated right the form we see now
[19:23] what we're living on now will be
[19:25] annihilated all right but he said I make
[19:27] all things new
[19:30] amen all right and see making him new
[19:34] doesn't mean that he's annihilating and
[19:37] making new right no something different
[19:41] right that's not the point that's that's
[19:44] the reason I thought well just let you
[19:46] read the book and you listen to the
[19:48] message of the future home and and let
[19:50] me just pick up a few things from this
[19:53] to just see you know kind of where we're
[19:55] at and who's going to be there and
[19:57] what's going to be in the the future
[20:01] home right we found there's going to be
[20:03] great things about the Millennium that
[20:05] we maybe had not considered right you
[20:09] know that in the Millennium there's
[20:10] going to be 144,000 of the Jews Unix for
[20:14] the
[20:15] bride then you got the fal
[20:19] Jew they will be in the
[20:21] Millennium I believe now I'm just giving
[20:23] you my
[20:25] beliefs and the prophet said they will
[20:27] be because under the fifth seal Jew
[20:30] there's no place for them to they get
[20:32] eternal life they get white robes before
[20:35] their Brethren are killed according to
[20:36] the Bible right so if they're given
[20:38] white robes they don't have to stand
[20:40] stand a white Throne judgment right amen
[20:43] now what I was thinking
[20:46] about and somebody buzzed me back to
[20:48] this place a minute
[20:52] but
[20:55] now the Jews rejected to r a son sunship
[20:59] we agree right amen all right the
[21:02] Gentiles came in to the
[21:04] position to where that they would
[21:06] receive Jesus Christ and become the Sons
[21:08] and Daughters of God all right then the
[21:11] Jews will be able to be in the
[21:13] Millennium because it's promised to them
[21:15] that's right but not there as a bride
[21:19] right
[21:20] right you know a
[21:23] wife it's the Gentiles that come into
[21:25] that position amen all right
[21:28] but they'll be
[21:30] there now that's what Wade was talking
[21:32] about there Sunday afternoon you know
[21:34] and I I was sitting there thinking that
[21:37] see we Are Spiritual Jews that's right
[21:40] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[21:42] absolutely amen Paul said it's not a Jew
[21:45] that's a Jew outwardly but a Jew that's
[21:47] a Jew inwardly all right now if that's
[21:51] true then maybe it's right I'm not
[21:53] meaning that maybe it's right I'm
[21:55] meaning it to you to where that you uh I
[21:59] got to put another in my
[22:01] pocket to let you think about it Paul
[22:05] said that all Israel would be
[22:08] saved now did he say every Israelite no
[22:13] no only the chosen right amen all right
[22:17] won't be ever Jew won't be ever
[22:18] Israelite that Liv in the Old Testament
[22:21] that will make it to the
[22:24] Millennium some of them may have to go
[22:26] to the grave and come up at the white
[22:27] throne and pleas your
[22:28] case but there'll be a chosen people out
[22:31] of the children of Israel that will be
[22:34] in the millennial Reign amen and you
[22:36] know why they'll be
[22:39] there that's where I sitting rejoicing
[22:43] listening thinking
[22:46] about you know that they'll be there
[22:48] because of us amen
[22:53] right
[22:54] right you think about that
[22:58] because of
[23:01] us you see they rejected the right to
[23:04] have that amen had they not been a
[23:08] bride a gentile Bride come on right had
[23:12] they not been one to come in to fill a
[23:17] position all Israel would have been
[23:23] lost see when Paul pleaded that case for
[23:26] those fifth sealed Jews
[23:36] wouldn't that you and I pleading the
[23:37] case for him right don't you plead the
[23:40] case for him today right
[23:43] sure I thought we believed in in um
[23:47] Hebrews 11 that they without us amen
[23:50] counting
[23:52] Abraham
[23:53] Enoch
[23:55] Noah all of those you're counting H down
[23:58] through there that they could not come
[24:00] forth to a rightful
[24:03] position they without us cannot receive
[24:05] the promise what was the promise come on
[24:07] and listen it's eternal life we know
[24:09] that but what was a promise to Israel
[24:11] this is this this is not the part of the
[24:14] message tonight this is just the way I
[24:16] think all
[24:18] right see Israel was God's chosen people
[24:22] you agree that's right that's right but
[24:25] because of their rejection the way they
[24:27] did
[24:29] it put him in a different place or
[24:31] position right but yet God didn't forget
[24:33] him right that's he said you're engraved
[24:36] on my hands I Can't Forget You
[24:41] amen no matter how bad Israel got God
[24:44] would always come back to them once they
[24:46] pleaded their case through the blood
[24:49] once they plad the atonement you know it
[24:51] was made or cried out for deliverance as
[24:53] we'd call
[24:55] it but you see Church
[24:59] they lost that
[25:00] position but when we stepped into that
[25:03] position it's just like eser that Wade
[25:06] was talking about see she represented
[25:09] all of her
[25:12] people all she had to do was back up and
[25:14] that's what H not
[25:18] Mori said she just backed up she could
[25:22] have set back and said H what I'm not a
[25:26] Jew right
[25:29] yep and she could have
[25:32] lived but he went on to say he said you
[25:35] know that that wouldn't work cuz she
[25:36] wouldn't do it so he says her he said
[25:38] you'd be caught in other
[25:40] words you'd be caught doing what you're
[25:42] doing so you're your life is at stake
[25:45] anyway she said okay y I'll put my life
[25:49] to stake on yep on my people
[25:54] then and see we spirit spiritual Jews
[25:59] that's right are crying out for Israel
[26:02] to be delivered yes sir right when it
[26:06] was over there in Israel Ruben the guide
[26:07] he said Sam pray for Israel I said I
[26:10] pray for Israel all the
[26:12] time the only thing I try to read in the
[26:15] newspapers I try I read the funniest CU
[26:17] to me that's the headlines and I get
[26:18] more news out of there than anywhere
[26:22] else the other thing I look is I try to
[26:24] see what's going on in Israel right
[26:30] yeah but them people have they rejected
[26:32] Jesus more
[26:34] they you sound like Martin
[26:38] Luther you sound like maybe you're still
[26:40] in his
[26:42] day because that's what he
[26:48] thought but you see we ought to be
[26:50] praying for
[26:51] Israel not for peace in Israel it never
[26:54] will be I don't pray for there be peace
[26:56] there that's that's impossible that's
[26:58] contrary to scripture right I pray for
[27:01] them
[27:03] right I pray for the 144,000 yes
[27:09] sir I pray for the two witnesses they
[27:12] may not even be on their Earth at this
[27:13] time I ain't no wor about
[27:16] it but our prayor should be for
[27:20] them and one of these days they'll
[27:22] recognize that we get over there on that
[27:25] other side in that Millennial reign
[27:27] they'll recognize what's going on right
[27:29] amen they may be able to gather around
[27:32] and call him son of
[27:34] David to fulfill the scriptures that he
[27:37] will be sitting on the throne but just
[27:39] remember he'll have a wife amen that's
[27:42] right to be sitting on the throne with
[27:44] him that's right and as Wade was showing
[27:46] from The Book of Esther she winds up to
[27:47] be just
[27:49] as you know he offers her he said I'll
[27:51] give you I think it's three or four
[27:53] times or five times I'll give you a half
[27:55] of the Kingdom finally he just says what
[27:57] do you want won't amen right it was just
[28:00] all settled
[28:03] amen I won't charge you for that I'll
[28:05] just give you what I think we see in the
[28:07] Millennium there's going to be a lot of
[28:09] people
[28:10] right but they'll be there because of
[28:12] you and I
[28:14] amen but then there'll be other times
[28:16] and then there'll be a future
[28:19] home well what are you going to do with
[28:21] all the
[28:22] Israel they went through the Millennium
[28:25] what are you going to do with all those
[28:26] people they don't have to stand the
[28:28] white thr on judgment to get eternal
[28:32] life cuz if they do show it to them in
[28:34] the message and show them into you
[28:37] know the
[28:40] scriptures that's what God thinks of his
[28:44] people but how much more does he think
[28:46] of his bride
[28:50] amen she's the one amen like I've always
[28:54] said Joseph might have talked to his
[28:56] brothers and revealed himself to him but
[28:59] he went home to his wife at night amen
[29:02] he didn't sleep with his
[29:04] brothers right but listen now keep that
[29:08] in mind and think about it and just
[29:11] think
[29:12] about who I is going to be in this
[29:16] future
[29:18] home and the description that is going
[29:22] to be
[29:25] there and we look go ahead and pull
[29:29] up Revelations 1 Brother
[29:34] Anderson we read that and I told him I
[29:37] said now we're going to come back and
[29:38] pick up again
[29:39] so while he's bringing it up he said I
[29:42] saw a
[29:43] new Heaven and a new Earth for the first
[29:47] Heaven and the first Earth were passed
[29:49] away and there was no more Sea Watch and
[29:53] I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem
[29:56] coming down from God out of
[29:59] Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[30:04] her
[30:07] husband now remember this as we get on
[30:09] over in a little bit and go backwards
[30:10] and forth maybe if we have time John
[30:13] will be describing the bride and and
[30:16] talking about the
[30:17] city he'll be describing the city and
[30:20] talking about the bride why because it's
[30:23] built according to our specifications
[30:25] you
[30:26] remember I go to prepare a place for you
[30:28] if I go to prepare a place for you then
[30:31] I'll come and receive you unto myself
[30:32] that there where I am there you may be
[30:34] also is that about John what 14 I think
[30:36] it is
[30:40] somewhere it's a beautiful ending part
[30:42] of what we think about the Plan of
[30:47] Redemption and who all is going to be in
[30:49] that City and what's going to be there
[30:51] but there'll be some things
[30:53] there now if I don't get to it
[30:58] brother R said there be things in the
[30:59] Millennium won't be in the future home
[31:00] that's
[31:01] right but there'll be things in the
[31:03] future home that won't be in the
[31:04] Millennium
[31:06] amen
[31:08] yep you got a millennium temple built in
[31:11] the Millennium that's right
[31:13] right it won't be no
[31:16] Temple you don't have to have no uh
[31:19] sacrifices and things in the future
[31:23] home but just remember the lamb will be
[31:26] there amen
[31:30] so you'll never be forgetting that's the
[31:32] one thing I want you to remember tonight
[31:33] if you get nothing out of the message is
[31:35] remember one things we don't forget
[31:39] anything in the Plan of Redemption
[31:42] right the Bible says the sunship will
[31:44] terminate that God may be all in
[31:48] all I can show you where the Prophet
[31:50] says that's in of
[31:55] Millennium but then he turned around and
[31:56] he says says that's in the future
[32:01] home because there's part there that
[32:04] will happen in the
[32:07] Millennium about the sunship
[32:12] terminating but then when it comes over
[32:14] to the Future home and that's not in the
[32:15] scripture where it says the sunship says
[32:17] the son shall become subject okay right
[32:20] okay somebody come along say it's not in
[32:21] the Bible it's it says when the sun ship
[32:24] will be offered up or or right you know
[32:28] it doesn't mean annihilated it means
[32:30] change in
[32:31] form it means it's like the future home
[32:34] the passing from
[32:36] one situation or thought or idea to
[32:39] another one right not annihilating of
[32:42] the
[32:43] world so then when it comes to the
[32:47] sunship of el it won't be that he'll be
[32:50] over here and the father will be over
[32:52] here
[32:54] yeah and then this over here just
[32:56] disappears
[33:00] no because church that's what we're
[33:02] supposed to be doing
[33:07] now we're supposed to be seeing now that
[33:10] God is
[33:12] one amen and there's no such thing as
[33:16] Father Son and Holy Ghost Blessed
[33:22] Trinity but yet I can call him father
[33:25] that's what they life from Brother
[33:26] Lincoln and them said some people up
[33:28] there life to them said how in the world
[33:30] said y'all all start out talking to the
[33:32] father and then you ask the son to help
[33:34] you and bless it all in Jesus name said
[33:36] y'all are really messed up well see I
[33:39] can call him
[33:40] father that's right I can call him
[33:44] brother I can call him savior am I can
[33:47] call him
[33:51] son why because I know what all the
[33:54] meanings are they're coming together to
[33:56] see one Tru true and living God that's
[33:59] is why it said I make all things
[34:01] new not
[34:04] different it brings it all into one
[34:08] view prophet in the church a book gets
[34:10] down and he said Here Comes the Capstone
[34:16] Revelation you want to look at the
[34:18] pyramid behind you and you see the word
[34:20] love what is that that's the Capstone
[34:22] Revelation in other words that's a
[34:23] revelation of Jesus Christ that I've
[34:25] been reading Revelations
[34:27] one one of eight and 93 times
[34:31] already that's the revelation of Jesus
[34:35] Christ that comes to the bride that's
[34:37] why I believe the headstone to the Bride
[34:39] of Jesus Christ is those Seven Seals
[34:42] that were brought to us by way of the
[34:44] prophet's message amen that's the
[34:47] headstone to me that's adoption to me
[34:49] that's the when you see that by
[34:52] Revelation not because you read the book
[34:54] that's right but when you see the the
[34:56] same God on the
[34:58] throne in chapter 1 and you see him in
[35:01] chapter 5 and you see him in chapter 19
[35:04] you see him in 21 you see him and you
[35:07] see him there in the word of God as
[35:08] being revealed to you as the one true
[35:10] and living God Amen and Jesus is his
[35:13] name
[35:15] amen right but you see I can call him
[35:20] Jesus man one time I remember years ago
[35:22] preaching this message he said now we
[35:24] know who to pray to
[35:27] and I
[35:29] thought now Lord help me you I don't
[35:32] want to be hateful and arog but help me
[35:34] a little bit you know uh maybe maybe he
[35:38] didn't see one God and he sees who to
[35:40] pray to but you see when I was in the
[35:42] Baptist I prayed to
[35:45] Jesus but I just couldn't figure out
[35:47] whether there was two or three of them
[35:49] right but I still prayed to Jesus didn't
[35:51] you and I prayed to the father and asked
[35:54] the Holy Ghost to help
[35:55] me but see the problem was that I
[35:58] couldn't get it figured out which one
[35:59] was which and what was going on
[36:02] right but through the opening of the
[36:04] word see I realize
[36:07] now then I can say Jesus
[36:10] Jesus and realize who he
[36:13] is that's the only name God ever had so
[36:17] I can stay with that name all right but
[36:19] get on with it
[36:22] now as I
[36:24] said in verse two tries to
[36:29] describe the holy city New
[36:34] Jerusalem John looks up and sees the
[36:36] future home coming
[36:39] down all
[36:41] right and as he sees it coming
[36:46] down it's like I've always tried to get
[36:48] you to see that like Ezekiel Saw fire
[36:51] falling down out of Heaven he didn't
[36:53] know what to call that nuclear war he
[36:56] saw fire fire falling out of Heaven he
[36:58] said who would it name said chariots
[37:00] josling in the street running like
[37:04] lightning cars were lights on running
[37:06] into each other out on the
[37:10] highway see not something
[37:13] different so when John says I
[37:17] saw the holy
[37:19] city New
[37:23] Jerusalem he said how can I describe it
[37:30] in a minute he'll start describing
[37:34] it but his first emphasis is upon
[37:39] what as a
[37:45] bride what a beautiful description of a
[37:47] city that you and I are going to BU live
[37:49] in the prophet said future home it'll be
[37:51] built according to our desires he said
[37:54] what if you had the money to build your
[37:55] wife a home that you can put every
[37:57] little thing right to her touch and
[37:59] right everything you
[38:01] know he said but you don't have to worry
[38:03] about him cuz he don't need the money to
[38:04] do it he's got all the material amen
[38:07] right it'll be there there'll be
[38:09] mountains CA some of you like mountains
[38:12] there'll be valleys cuz some of you like
[38:15] valleys there'll be deserts but they'll
[38:17] Blossom like a rose okay let's make sure
[38:20] we keep it right it won't be a hot dried
[38:22] up
[38:23] desert be blossoming like a rose
[38:27] all right but think about it
[38:34] now he saw the city coming
[38:38] down and he describes
[38:43] it and says it's just like the what the
[38:48] bride now remember this is the
[38:53] John that saw the bride go up in
[38:56] Revelations 1 uh 41 right this is the
[39:00] John that saw the bride in Revelations 5
[39:04] to be the priest and Kings right right
[39:07] this is the John that saw the
[39:10] wife right coming back in Revelations 19
[39:16] y so is there any problem to describe
[39:19] her describe the city as a
[39:22] bride right we'll get on over in a
[39:25] minute but you when you get over to
[39:26] verse 9 it says come hither and I'll
[39:28] show Thee the bride the Lamb's
[39:32] wife and then he start talking about a
[39:35] natural city
[39:40] right see that's why we could just stay
[39:42] for months and months and months upon
[39:44] all of these
[39:46] things to try to bring out the Plan of
[39:52] Redemption that city is going to be
[39:54] built to exactly fit right the
[40:00] bride if you were building a town you
[40:03] would have a th000 people you'd have a
[40:05] th homes you know or
[40:08] something
[40:13] right you'd maybe have a th000 homes but
[40:16] you wouldn't have 10,000 bathrooms
[40:17] that's what I like about it cuz they
[40:19] always say when you building a house if
[40:21] you put in three bedrooms put in four
[40:24] bathrooms cuz it always you know you
[40:26] there ain't going to be no bathrooms
[40:28] there that's right okay so it'll solve
[40:31] that
[40:32] problem but just think about it
[40:35] now
[40:38] John you said a a new Heaven and a new
[40:43] Earth for the first Heaven and the first
[40:45] Earth were passed
[40:46] away go ahead with number four brother
[40:50] on Isaiah
[40:52] 65 and look what he
[40:55] says look what what Isaiah has to say
[40:57] about these
[41:06] things for
[41:10] behold I create new
[41:14] Heavens see know there's your word
[41:16] plural
[41:18] heavens and a new Earth it'll always be
[41:21] that one
[41:22] singular and the former shall not be
[41:24] remembered nor coming to mind
[41:27] be glad and rejoice forever in that
[41:30] which I
[41:31] create for behold I create Jerusalem of
[41:36] rejoicing that's not a
[41:38] town right towns don't Rejoice right
[41:42] that's right right worlds don't
[41:46] Rejoice I create Jerusalem a
[41:49] rejoicing and her
[41:52] people a
[41:53] joy the people are rejoicing not the
[41:56] world and I will rejoice in
[41:59] Jerusalem and joy in my
[42:03] people and the voice of weeping shall be
[42:05] no more heard in her nor the voice of
[42:08] crying
[42:10] amen I create new
[42:14] Heavens the new
[42:18] Earth see then what is
[42:21] it but said
[42:25] now Jerusalem are
[42:29] rejoicing and her people of
[42:32] Joy towns don't holler and scream but
[42:34] people
[42:36] do God my point is John is
[42:40] describing when he looks up to see the
[42:43] city coming down he
[42:46] says well let's be carnal let's be
[42:52] carnal if John was up looking the city
[42:54] coming down he couldn't see nothing but
[42:56] at the bottom of
[42:57] it let's just be
[43:02] carnal but see he done seen that
[43:05] bride and he knew this was her
[43:09] home and it looks just like
[43:11] her what about a God that thinks that
[43:14] much of you and I amen what about a God
[43:17] that would do these
[43:21] things all
[43:23] right be glad and rejoice in that which
[43:25] I create for behold I create Jerusalem
[43:28] in
[43:30] rejoicing Isaiah 62 go to number
[43:34] five 66 excuse me Isaiah
[43:40] 66:22 for as the new heavens and the new
[43:44] Earth which I will make shall remain
[43:46] before me sayth the Lord so shall your
[43:49] seed in your name
[43:52] remain you're not talking about
[43:54] buildings and towns and world and
[43:57] places he's got his people in mind and
[44:00] it shall come to pass that from one new
[44:02] moon to another remember the future home
[44:05] outside of the city there will even be
[44:08] day and night and seasons and different
[44:11] things outside the city all right and
[44:15] they shall come to pass that from one
[44:16] new moon to another and from one Sabbath
[44:18] to another shall All Flesh come to
[44:21] worship before me sayeth the
[44:23] Lord the prophet said in the future home
[44:26] if you listen to the message you heard
[44:27] him talking about how that the people
[44:30] the would come in and bring their
[44:33] offering in to
[44:39] worship and as they go back out they'll
[44:42] take a leaf you remember that in the
[44:43] scripture I think that's in chapter
[44:47] 22 I wrote in my Bible there one day
[44:49] like this I said the leaves is for the
[44:51] healing of the
[44:53] Nations but the bride eats the fruit off
[44:56] the tree of
[44:58] life cuz we're not going to just be
[45:00] dealing with leaves and I don't think
[45:02] when they pull one leaf off and take off
[45:04] there'll be I think it'll be another one
[45:06] right back don't you
[45:08] yeah not going to be a gap or a void but
[45:12] look what he's just
[45:15] saying they from one new moon to the
[45:17] other now I've got to say it this way to
[45:20] where it will follow
[45:22] through and I can show you if you want
[45:24] it brother brand
[45:27] covers Isaiah
[45:30] 65 and covers it on the Millennium which
[45:34] that will be and Isaiah 65 has a lot in
[45:37] it about that the the uh you know the
[45:40] the uh not a child would die 100 you
[45:44] know and things and the the lon and the
[45:46] ox laying down together but brother
[45:48] brandom says that there's a compound in
[45:50] other words he takes a compound meaning
[45:51] so when he gets to Revelations 21 and
[45:54] talking about New Jerusalem he goes
[45:56] right back to Isaiah
[45:58] 65 so Isaiah 65 will be in a two two
[46:01] form part or what you call it that's to
[46:04] speaking to where we'll be in the
[46:06] Millennium and things will be there but
[46:09] when you go into the future
[46:10] home there'll be different little things
[46:13] but it'll still be the same New
[46:14] Jerusalem you understand right cuz it
[46:17] really if you took it from any man's
[46:19] ideas you wouldn't find people picking
[46:21] up scoffield does a good job of picking
[46:24] up the to the the fision between the
[46:26] Millennium and the future home but they
[46:30] still can't get it together like brother
[46:31] brandom had it right all
[46:34] right but now
[46:36] listen jump over to the New Testament
[46:39] now look at number six second Peter you
[46:41] know these scriptures let's just read a
[46:43] little
[46:45] bit 2 Peter 3:10 through1 13 the day of
[46:49] the Lord will come as a thief in the
[46:51] night in which the heavens shall pass
[46:54] away with a great noise
[46:56] Y and the element shall melt with
[46:58] fervent heat the Earth also in the works
[47:01] that are therein shall be burned up but
[47:04] you remember the word pass away there is
[47:06] the same word as new birth right it
[47:09] doesn't mean the world will be totally
[47:12] annihilated it'll mean the sinful part
[47:14] of it all right and watch seeing that
[47:18] all these things shall be
[47:21] dissolved you know all this world Cosmo
[47:24] what manner of person are you to be in
[47:26] all holy conversation and godliness
[47:29] right looking far and Hasting unto the
[47:33] coming of the day of God wherein the
[47:36] heavens being on fire shall be dissolved
[47:39] and the elements shall melt with fervent
[47:41] heat nevertheless we according to his
[47:46] promise look for new
[47:49] heavens and a new Earth wherein dwelleth
[47:54] righteousness now if you went went
[47:55] through the future home you heard the
[47:57] prophet using those
[47:59] scriptures to telling us the world will
[48:01] not be
[48:06] annihilated just wipe off everything
[48:08] that's no good and then
[48:11] just start
[48:13] over and make it
[48:16] new will'll never be no trouble will
[48:19] there
[48:21] right cuz we're looking for that Paul
[48:23] say or Peter excuse me says looking for
[48:26] that new heavens and new earth where in
[48:30] dwelleth righteousness look over at
[48:31] Revelations 21:9
[48:34] now number
[48:38] seven Revelation 21 9-14 using just
[48:44] Parts but what I want you to think about
[48:46] is of what I started
[48:49] off he sees a city he describes as a
[48:53] bride he sees the bride he describes her
[48:56] as a
[48:59] city see you can't separate it but watch
[49:03] and there came unto me one of the Seven
[49:05] Angels which had the seven vows full of
[49:06] the seven Place plagues and talked with
[49:08] me saying come here and I'll show Thee
[49:11] the bride the Lamb's
[49:14] wife now watch what he starts
[49:19] describing and then you'll understand
[49:21] what I was hitting at start with there a
[49:24] little without us they would not be any
[49:26] of
[49:29] this without the bride and
[49:32] her uh closeness to him
[49:37] and there wouldn't be anything
[49:40] else we have no need of it but because
[49:44] of her these things come into
[49:47] being watch what he saids and he carried
[49:49] me away in the spirit to a great and
[49:51] high mountain and showed me that great
[49:54] Mountain the holy jerus Jerusalem
[49:56] descending Out of Heaven from
[50:00] God
[50:02] now having the glory of God in her light
[50:05] was like unto a stone most precious even
[50:09] like a jasper stone clear as
[50:12] Crystal now here's what I want you to
[50:14] think about and look look at verse
[50:17] 12 this city
[50:22] now are you going to leave Israel out of
[50:24] your Redemptive
[50:29] plan are you going to be as Luther said
[50:31] the ought to be taken out and
[50:38] destroyed of what I've tried to preach
[50:41] to you what I
[50:43] believe that Israel is going to go
[50:45] through the millennial reign with
[50:49] us but they won't be the
[50:53] bride but they'll be there as a promise
[50:56] to
[50:57] David that he would turn out to be the
[50:59] son of
[51:00] David but you see we see him now as Son
[51:02] of God Son of Man son of David the Alpha
[51:05] and Omega the beginning and the end the
[51:07] bright and Morning Star amen Rose of
[51:09] Sher and Lily of the Valley we see him
[51:12] as all of those things already and you
[51:14] remember the little woman she said Son
[51:16] of David have mercy on
[51:19] me he just didn't listen to
[51:23] her but when them Jews would say son of
[51:25] David he'd stop because they're pointing
[51:28] to a promise right he said yes
[51:33] Lord us
[51:36] dogs I said we eat the crumbs off the
[51:38] master's
[51:40] table that's right he wasn't worried
[51:43] about what she called
[51:46] him right he was no longer whether she
[51:49] was saying son of David or son of man or
[51:52] Son of God or Yahweh or Jehovah or
[51:56] whatever she doesn't made a personal
[51:58] contact with him
[52:00] amen right he
[52:04] stopped he ain't found that much faith
[52:06] in
[52:08] Israel that reminded him like I've
[52:11] always told you that reminded him of
[52:13] what he come to do he come to get a
[52:15] gentile bride cuz he knew what he was
[52:17] going to do sure he come to Israel but
[52:18] his Israel rejected him and he turned to
[52:21] the Gentiles to bring out a
[52:24] bride
[52:26] all
[52:27] right so think about it pull that back
[52:29] up brother let's continue
[52:36] on and had a wall great and
[52:40] high and had 12 gates now this is that
[52:44] future home that your
[52:46] Prophet told us about right it's got a
[52:50] wall great and
[52:53] high every body deals with how much it
[52:56] is up this way and how big it is that
[52:58] way and what it covers this way and but
[53:03] do they think
[53:04] about see it had 12 gates
[53:11] right and at the gate 12
[53:16] angels and names written their
[53:19] own which are the names of the 12
[53:23] tribes of the children of
[53:27] Israel if you're going to enter the city
[53:31] you're going to come through by the wall
[53:34] right a
[53:36] gate and it will be Israel
[53:39] right just
[53:41] remember our roots are Jewish whether
[53:44] you like it or not
[53:46] right Paul said don't bear brag of
[53:50] this you better brag of the roots that
[53:53] bu you right right I don't care about
[53:55] Israel will you better start learning to
[53:57] love them because she's going to be
[53:59] there that's right and if you're going
[54:00] to go out of the gate you're going to
[54:02] out of one of those names you're going
[54:05] to go come back in you're going to come
[54:06] back through one of them names
[54:11] amen
[54:14] right well all I want is going down
[54:16] there below yeah on down there below
[54:18] where you get to the
[54:23] apostles it say not a gate with an
[54:26] apostle
[54:28] right so what I said I just want to get
[54:31] into Revelation 21 just talk a little
[54:33] bit
[54:34] and finish this series
[54:37] up and finish it up by showing you what
[54:41] I've preached for 92
[54:46] sermons that when we get there in the
[54:48] millennial Reign the Jews will be there
[54:50] too
[54:53] y 144,000 will be there the F sealed Jew
[54:56] will be
[54:58] there but there won't be the bride of
[55:01] Christ but he'll be
[55:04] there God ain't forgot his
[55:09] people Paul cried daily for Israel he
[55:13] even said I'd be a cast
[55:14] away but look what he
[55:19] says and had a wall great and high and
[55:22] had 12 gates and at the gates 12 Ang
[55:25] angels and names written there on which
[55:27] are the names of the 12 tribes of the
[55:30] children of Israel on the East three
[55:33] gates roll on on the north three gates
[55:35] on the south three
[55:40] gates what is it and on the west three
[55:43] gates you remember how went through all
[55:45] the years we preached on the camps of
[55:47] Israel and how they camp three three
[55:49] three and three and all of the things
[55:51] and their travel and their Journeys we
[55:54] get to the Future home they're still
[55:55] there that's
[55:59] right if that don't make you feel good
[56:01] there's something wrong with you
[56:04] inwardly that God would
[56:08] remember his promise right to
[56:13] Israel this is the future
[56:16] home they get to Millennium as their
[56:19] thing but he doesn't forget them
[56:22] then they get to the millennium that's
[56:25] wonderful but now they're in the future
[56:29] home well you say well he kept his
[56:31] promise in the Millennium yeah but now
[56:33] he gives them a
[56:36] gate amen with their name on
[56:39] it he still ain't forgot
[56:42] him he still remembers and he says
[56:45] you're the apple of my
[56:50] eye like that wheel in the middle of the
[56:52] wheel and all in Ezekiel where he seen
[56:55] the travel of Israel down through the
[56:56] Wilderness
[56:58] Journey that's what he
[57:01] saw the wheels are turning the thing
[57:05] said the Chariots going down through
[57:07] there the wagons and what
[57:10] thing now watch on the East Gates North
[57:13] now watch verse 14 then we just use in
[57:16] 14 and then we'll jump to 19 to save
[57:19] reading but verse 14 of the same it says
[57:21] and the walls of the city had 12 found
[57:24] found
[57:26] ations now remember these are the gates
[57:29] that was around the wall now it says and
[57:31] the wall of the city had 12
[57:34] foundations and in them the names of the
[57:37] 12
[57:38] Apostles of the
[57:41] land they may have a
[57:46] gate but the bride is the
[57:50] foundation is that what the scripture
[57:52] said we're built on the foundation
[57:53] Apostles and Prophets
[57:55] Jesus Christ being the Chief
[57:58] Cornerstone going on up to the next one
[58:00] on verse 19 just just to save time
[58:05] reading 21 the foundation of walls of
[58:07] the city were garnished with all manner
[58:09] of precious stone first one is Jasper
[58:12] second sire third go on Fifth goes on
[58:15] down and the 12 gates were 12 pearls now
[58:18] he's driving back to the
[58:20] gates he describes a wall jumps back to
[58:22] the
[58:23] gates ever several gate was of one Pearl
[58:27] and the street of the city was pure gold
[58:29] as it were transparent
[58:31] GL what about
[58:34] it that's what he thinks of the Jews and
[58:36] the
[58:37] Gentiles
[58:39] amen they're going to be
[58:44] there but you know those old hateful
[58:47] arrogant people that don't want to love
[58:48] people are love the Jews even though
[58:50] they crucified Christ you believe one
[58:53] thing
[58:55] if they hadn't rejected Christ you would
[58:59] have no hopes of
[59:01] Salvation that's right you better thank
[59:05] God for what they done that's
[59:08] right but they killed my Messiah no they
[59:12] didn't kill your Messiah I'm sorry you
[59:15] killed him right I killed him it was my
[59:18] sin that nailed him to the Cross amen
[59:21] not the sins of the
[59:23] Jews
[59:25] my sins and your sins put him there
[59:28] watch now as we get to it look what he
[59:30] comes up with now remember I said in the
[59:32] Millennium you're going to have a temple
[59:37] built right there'll be a millennium
[59:39] Temple Ezekiel 40 to 44 in a different
[59:42] thing won't be no animal sacrifices in
[59:45] there going on no there won't be nothing
[59:47] like that in the Millennium come on get
[59:49] out of that don't put your mind in the
[59:50] wrong Channel it won't be any of those
[59:52] things but look here and I saw no
[59:56] Temple therein for the Lord God Almighty
[1:00:00] and the lamb are the Temple of it still
[1:00:03] didn't have any trouble putting God
[1:00:06] Almighty in the
[1:00:09] lamb because remember what I said while
[1:00:13] ago someday
[1:00:16] somewhere the sun will become subject
[1:00:19] that God may be all and in
[1:00:22] all the prophet says m then he says
[1:00:25] future home
[1:00:27] okay the city had no need of the
[1:00:31] Sun but it doesn't mean outside outside
[1:00:34] they can have moons and have all kind of
[1:00:38] things neither of the moon to shine in
[1:00:41] it for the glory of God did light in it
[1:00:43] and the lamb is a light thereof I
[1:00:46] thought that when the children of Israel
[1:00:47] was in gion and the world went dark but
[1:00:51] they had light
[1:00:53] am what about a
[1:00:55] day and the nations of them which are
[1:00:58] saved shall walk in the light of it they
[1:01:01] come in and out and the kings of the
[1:01:03] earth do bring their Glory and Honor
[1:01:05] into it come in and out of the city and
[1:01:08] the gates of it shall not be shut At All
[1:01:12] by
[1:01:14] day for there shall be no night
[1:01:18] there
[1:01:20] right and it shall not be shut all at
[1:01:24] all by
[1:01:25] day see what to say a night no he
[1:01:28] emphasized it for there shall be no
[1:01:31] night there's not going to be a night
[1:01:34] and they shall bring the glory and honor
[1:01:35] of the Nations into
[1:01:37] it but nothing will be able to come in
[1:01:41] there see and th shall in no wise enter
[1:01:46] into it anything that defileth neither
[1:01:48] whatsoever worketh Abomination or maketh
[1:01:50] a lie they which are written in the
[1:01:52] Lamb's Book of Life amen now let me end
[1:01:56] that
[1:02:01] up by saying
[1:02:03] this leave that last verse up
[1:02:08] brother I want you to think about
[1:02:14] something by this time in the future
[1:02:18] home there is no
[1:02:21] devil there's no demons
[1:02:27] I agree you
[1:02:31] agree as I said when we get that other
[1:02:33] camera turned around we can see them
[1:02:35] amens yeah yeah
[1:02:39] y you can also hear them now on the
[1:02:42] sound
[1:02:43] system cuz that little thing that's
[1:02:46] right up there in the middle that you
[1:02:48] look up there and
[1:02:49] see is a microphone that's picking up
[1:02:52] all of your amens or omes and they're
[1:02:56] going on the
[1:02:58] internet so go
[1:03:02] ahead but listen
[1:03:04] Church why would God come back to a
[1:03:09] point and I think he does it in chapter
[1:03:11] 22 and refers again why would he refer
[1:03:15] that there won't be nobody coming in and
[1:03:16] out that's of any vile thing right there
[1:03:21] won't be anybody outside that's vile
[1:03:23] that's right
[1:03:27] why is he emphasizing
[1:03:31] that there won't be anybody outside of
[1:03:35] the city this vile there won't be no
[1:03:39] well now what it's meaning was they used
[1:03:41] to
[1:03:43] be Heaven help
[1:03:46] you because of the white thr judgment
[1:03:50] things ought have been taken care of and
[1:03:53] if not then the fire will come down of
[1:03:55] Gog and Magog and annihilate
[1:04:02] all you
[1:04:06] understand but why would he go back and
[1:04:08] emphasize that
[1:04:15] statement well brother D like said you
[1:04:18] know them it's outside now they used to
[1:04:19] be these things and God still remembers
[1:04:22] so he's no no no no no
[1:04:24] I'm sorry you've missed the whole point
[1:04:26] of all I've tried to
[1:04:29] preach he said I'll make all things new
[1:04:35] right if he can't remember our
[1:04:40] sins they're in the sea of
[1:04:43] forgetfulness would not the sin of those
[1:04:46] at the white
[1:04:47] Throne go to the sea of
[1:04:52] forgetfulness when not is is's
[1:04:59] unbelief be placed in the sea of
[1:05:04] forgetfulness are you
[1:05:11] listening it's not a gr bunch of people
[1:05:14] outside that's a dirty bunch of
[1:05:16] people ain't no devil to make them
[1:05:20] dirty he's annihilated that's right
[1:05:26] you see the prophet preached a
[1:05:30] message that I'd ask you to go home and
[1:05:34] read I could have brought these but I'd
[1:05:37] like for you to read
[1:05:40] it Butz I thought I'd be another hour
[1:05:42] and a half on
[1:05:44] this I'm doing pretty good getting
[1:05:49] through why Lord would you talk about
[1:05:58] why would you talk
[1:06:00] about anybody that whatsoever work with
[1:06:04] abomination to make a
[1:06:06] lie why would you even mention that
[1:06:10] Lord I want you to read the invisible
[1:06:13] Union because we will use it a lot when
[1:06:15] we get into the marriage and
[1:06:17] divorce we'll come back to this
[1:06:21] scripture right here make take us months
[1:06:28] but look at the end of the sentence and
[1:06:31] you got your
[1:06:35] answer or maketh a lie nothing's going
[1:06:38] to be there there's any
[1:06:40] defilements any
[1:06:42] Abomination anything making a
[1:06:44] lie but they which are written in the
[1:06:48] L's Book of
[1:06:53] Life
[1:06:58] then we realize that the white Throne
[1:07:00] judgment that I tried to preach of the
[1:07:02] other day a few weeks
[1:07:05] back that that white Throne
[1:07:08] judgment everything's going to be
[1:07:10] annihilated
[1:07:18] there and they'll be judged according to
[1:07:21] their
[1:07:22] deeds
[1:07:28] but they'll check a record to see if
[1:07:30] their name is in the Book of
[1:07:34] Life you see you think I preach Mighty
[1:07:37] slow and drag out things I could preach
[1:07:39] three months right there off of
[1:07:42] that I'm honest folks I try to cut it
[1:07:45] down to where just to get you the top
[1:07:49] points at that white Throne
[1:07:52] judgment
[1:07:57] a person will be judged the prophet says
[1:08:00] if you want me to go back through the
[1:08:01] message be glad to give you the quotes
[1:08:04] at the whiteone Judgment they won't look
[1:08:06] to see whether your Deeds were good or
[1:08:09] bad you look to see whether your name
[1:08:12] was in The Book of
[1:08:17] Life if your name's not in the book of
[1:08:20] life you can't plead your case at the
[1:08:22] white throne
[1:08:25] you don't have a
[1:08:29] case all right The Book of
[1:08:34] Life when was it
[1:08:39] written before the foundation of the
[1:08:43] world in God's mind no no no not brother
[1:08:47] Dale I was written back there was the
[1:08:48] lamb book of life now you got a
[1:08:52] problem you didn't
[1:08:57] listen you didn't listen and you haven't
[1:09:01] listened where I was trying my best to
[1:09:04] describe back there a few weeks ago
[1:09:06] about how that there The Book of Life
[1:09:09] and the L's Book of Life is the same
[1:09:13] book just two different
[1:09:16] sections was you
[1:09:19] listening two different sections of the
[1:09:21] same book right
[1:09:30] God knew before the foundation of the
[1:09:32] world that You' come to a place to have
[1:09:34] your name written in the
[1:09:37] book the prophet of God says your name
[1:09:39] goes on the book at
[1:09:41] sanctification he said judas's name was
[1:09:43] in the book said he was a part of the
[1:09:45] religious order I'm quoting it centered
[1:09:47] around the worship of God of that
[1:09:52] day see if you're if your name's not in
[1:09:54] the book of life it will never be in the
[1:09:56] L's book of
[1:09:58] life cuz it's just two sections of the
[1:10:00] same book the prophet of God I gave you
[1:10:03] the quotes he said one leads out to the
[1:10:10] other you realize when you got
[1:10:13] saved God didn't write your name in the
[1:10:16] book in heaven the day you got
[1:10:20] saved a prophet wouldn't say in the day
[1:10:22] you come to sanctification
[1:10:24] your name was written in heaven he's
[1:10:27] saying that before the foundation of the
[1:10:29] world he knew Judas is car would come to
[1:10:32] sanctification and his name would be
[1:10:34] written in the book of
[1:10:42] life but he rejected Jesus Christ and
[1:10:45] when he did his name was taken out of
[1:10:47] the book of life right amen your name
[1:10:50] can be removed from the book of life
[1:10:52] right sir section of life right but it
[1:10:56] can never be removed from the L's book
[1:10:58] of
[1:11:02] life now you go to sleep on me and then
[1:11:04] one of these days you accuse me saying
[1:11:06] something else and I'm going to tell you
[1:11:07] I didn't say
[1:11:12] it see you you don't pay that much
[1:11:17] attention I've tried to be specific it
[1:11:20] plain blunt to bring down to you the
[1:11:22] Plan of Redemption
[1:11:24] through the Book of
[1:11:27] Revelations the prophet said he said
[1:11:30] it's two books
[1:11:32] y he said that's going to be confusing
[1:11:35] when you get to that through the opening
[1:11:37] of the seals and things but then he go
[1:11:40] WR he said it's not two
[1:11:41] books he said it's one book with two
[1:11:46] sections he said if your name was never
[1:11:48] written in the Book of
[1:11:51] Life you'll never be be
[1:11:57] saved the god before the world says to
[1:12:00] Gil sha that you and I would become
[1:12:05] Christians be part of a religious
[1:12:09] order that's right maybe not know the
[1:12:11] word but yet trying to believe in the
[1:12:16] God and he'd write her name in the book
[1:12:18] of life before the world ever
[1:12:22] begun
[1:12:27] but you better hold on now for a
[1:12:30] minute because when you get into the
[1:12:32] indivisible Union you find the prophet
[1:12:34] saying it like this he said your name is
[1:12:38] transferred that's
[1:12:44] right he said there's no such thing as a
[1:12:47] new name been written down in heaven he
[1:12:48] said it's all written before the world
[1:12:50] he said but that's in the Book of Life
[1:12:56] but then he went on to see those that
[1:12:58] would accept Jesus Christ and become
[1:13:00] fully Born Again Christians not just be
[1:13:02] a Judas as a religious order that could
[1:13:05] have their names removed but he would
[1:13:07] see some whose names would be in the
[1:13:10] section called the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:13:13] slain Revelation 8 138 slain before the
[1:13:16] foundation of the
[1:13:19] world but you see church if you don't
[1:13:21] see your name transferred
[1:13:24] that's right can't you see that you was
[1:13:27] part of a religious order I was part of
[1:13:29] a religious order and then when we did
[1:13:32] receive the new birth that that brought
[1:13:34] eternal life to you and I and our soul
[1:13:37] and our name was
[1:13:40] transferred he said it's not going to be
[1:13:42] a space that's empty
[1:13:46] right but he said your name was
[1:13:52] transferred
[1:13:56] transferred from The Book of Life to the
[1:13:57] Lamb's Book of Life that's
[1:13:59] right not transferred like transferring
[1:14:03] and racing out one writing it on the
[1:14:04] other I've never preached nothing like
[1:14:08] that but when you come to the
[1:14:11] realization that that new birth you got
[1:14:13] inside of you is eternal life dire is
[1:14:17] your name in the Lamb's Book of Life am
[1:14:22] you realize that was there it wasn't
[1:14:24] just
[1:14:26] transferred it was racing out all of the
[1:14:28] Deeds that you done and the things that
[1:14:30] existed in the book of
[1:14:33] life and you come to a realization that
[1:14:37] God is
[1:14:41] eternal now for a moment to try to prove
[1:14:47] that because you say well you got to
[1:14:49] have
[1:14:51] Bible all right
[1:14:53] Brother Anderson pull life scriptures
[1:14:56] back up please
[1:15:02] sir see I like to be able to put it in
[1:15:04] the scripture that's right then when I
[1:15:06] got it in the scripture I don't have to
[1:15:07] worry about it rolling up to the light
[1:15:10] to where we were getting to
[1:15:16] the won't be nobody in there end that's
[1:15:19] got anything left won't be no
[1:15:22] defilement won't be nobody working
[1:15:24] Abomination got any problems it won't be
[1:15:26] you out here well I'm just can't help it
[1:15:30] no all of that's
[1:15:32] gone I create all things
[1:15:35] new so think about
[1:15:38] it all those Old Testament
[1:15:43] Jews that had their name in The Book of
[1:15:47] Life they would really stay with the
[1:15:49] word as best as they
[1:15:52] could they will be given eternal
[1:15:56] life their name will prove that it was
[1:15:58] on the book of
[1:16:00] life but they will be placed in the
[1:16:02] Eternal
[1:16:04] section come on if they're giv eternal
[1:16:07] life even somebody to White thrown
[1:16:09] judgment a foolish virgin is given
[1:16:11] eternal life their name will be BR moved
[1:16:14] into the lamb Book of
[1:16:18] Life which is eternal
[1:16:22] life The Plan of
[1:16:24] Redemption to look at Israel and see all
[1:16:27] of those people that comes up into the
[1:16:28] future
[1:16:30] home they'll come in and out they bring
[1:16:33] their Glory and Honor in
[1:16:38] too they just can't
[1:16:42] stay they can come to
[1:16:45] visit they can't
[1:16:47] stay why cuz there where the bride
[1:16:52] is no room for
[1:16:55] them no place for them other than coming
[1:16:58] in getting a leaf and going back
[1:17:01] out but they'll be just as Eternal in
[1:17:03] Soul and body and spirit I don't believe
[1:17:07] if I'm wrong correct me I don't believe
[1:17:09] when we get to the Future home there's
[1:17:10] going to be a bunch of people running
[1:17:12] around that are not
[1:17:15] Eternal I don't believe it I believe in
[1:17:18] the Millennium they can be a gentile
[1:17:21] that raise it up that will not be
[1:17:25] Eternal but I've done preach to you over
[1:17:28] and over to show you the F shal Jew
[1:17:29] don't go to the white Throne judgment so
[1:17:32] they'll go into the Millennium with
[1:17:34] eternal
[1:17:35] life Israel is an a hold of the
[1:17:39] collective you know the special chosen
[1:17:41] of Israel in the Millennium they won't
[1:17:43] have to be there as natural people
[1:17:44] they'll be there too cuz they have
[1:17:46] eternal
[1:17:47] life 144,000 they have eternal
[1:17:52] life yep but when you go to the Future
[1:17:54] home it ain't nobody there they don't
[1:17:56] have eternal life
[1:18:00] amen but it's because we
[1:18:06] chose I hope you can read invisible
[1:18:09] Union and see where the Prophet said
[1:18:12] your name was
[1:18:17] transferred well you mean it wasn't over
[1:18:19] there
[1:18:21] no he goes on he said it won't be a
[1:18:24] blank
[1:18:28] space see you and I that's what the new
[1:18:31] birth is the new birth is not to wait
[1:18:34] till the white Throne judgment and get
[1:18:35] eternal
[1:18:36] life the new birth is not Israel to
[1:18:39] receive eternal life and be in the
[1:18:41] Millennium and
[1:18:44] things the new birth is for you and I to
[1:18:47] realize our
[1:18:49] name has been
[1:18:51] transferred we may have been part of a
[1:18:54] religious order of our day and centered
[1:18:56] around worship and going to church and
[1:18:58] things but when you receive that new
[1:19:03] birth your soul is
[1:19:06] eternal right there's the Lamb's Book of
[1:19:13] Life The Plan of
[1:19:16] Redemption 93

[1:24:47] of be able to preach the Plan of
[1:24:51] Redemption out of a book that we were

[1:26:00] Jerusalem lighting up on an entire
[1:26:02] redeemed
[1:26:05] Earth that's what he says about
[1:26:10] him liting on Jesus Christ are redeemed
[1:26:13] entire Earth he say because from his
[1:26:16] body being redeemed he redeemed our
[1:26:20] bodies what about him
[1:26:24] you
[1:26:26] are more
[1:26:28] beautiful
[1:26:31] than and
[1:26:35] nothing compares to one more time before
[1:26:38] we
[1:26:42] go
[1:26:44] Lord you
[1:26:50] are the three most valuable
[1:26:54] things you
[1:26:56] are more
[1:26:59] costly than
[1:27:01] go what about it the three things that
[1:27:04] people kill around the world are
[1:27:06] fighting over those three
[1:27:10] things and we look at him and see
[1:27:14] him I
[1:27:16] Des
[1:27:21] comp think about
[1:27:23] him think about what he's done for you
[1:27:26] and I that's
[1:27:29] right remember we kept on reading
[1:27:32] blessed are
[1:27:33] they that hear this
[1:27:36] prophecy cuz we're talking about a
[1:27:38] prophecy tonight we're talking about a
[1:27:40] future home a millennium amen and the
[1:27:43] things yet to
[1:27:45] come but yet we can stand here and know
[1:27:47] what's going to take place there and
[1:27:50] know that we don't have to stand before
[1:27:51] the white throne right
[1:27:53] amen and know that we can sit there with
[1:27:56] him on his
[1:28:00] thr that's what I've always said you
[1:28:02] just think what it's going to come to
[1:28:05] the people you're testifying to they'll
[1:28:08] walk before
[1:28:09] you and God will simply turn and say did
[1:28:12] you tell
[1:28:13] them that
[1:28:18] yes but you see well you can say well I
[1:28:20] just won't tell nobody then
[1:28:22] but then the Bible says then their blood
[1:28:24] is on your hand so which way do you want
[1:28:27] it you want their blood on your hand or
[1:28:30] do you want to try to relieve them from
[1:28:31] their pressure of the blood you know get
[1:28:33] the blood to
[1:28:34] them see I know by preaching that I hurt
[1:28:39] feelings I know by doing it I hurt
[1:28:41] feelings CU I have to take a
[1:28:46] stand you think I enjoy just being able
[1:28:49] to holler and scream at people no
[1:28:54] I take a stand though I've got to to
[1:28:56] preach the truth that's right and speak
[1:28:59] it like it I believe it and then if I do
[1:29:02] then see that's a problem that I've
[1:29:04] always had with the preachers this
[1:29:05] message they won't tell you what they
[1:29:07] believe right you know they'll get right
[1:29:10] up here we've had them this pull pit get
[1:29:12] up here and say I'm going to get a new
[1:29:13] body you go outside and you kind of talk
[1:29:16] around a little bit you know and you say
[1:29:17] well you know you know you getting a new
[1:29:19] body said I don't mean different it's
[1:29:22] this body yeah that's what I believe
[1:29:24] it's this body redeemed but they stood
[1:29:28] here and said they're going to get a new
[1:29:29] body so you can't determine what they
[1:29:33] believe
[1:29:36] right but there one thing about it you
[1:29:38] know for sure
[1:29:41] that you know what I
[1:29:45] believe all right father we've committed
[1:29:49] this service to you Lord in this whole
[1:29:51] series
[1:29:55] and Lord we just ask you to come now and
[1:29:57] help us to see ourselves and to realize
[1:30:00] realization and walk on with you Lord

[1:30:17] could come and just explain it in the
[1:30:20] simplest terms that we could understand
[1:30:23] and find out what's going
[1:30:24] on Lord we love you thank you go home
[1:30:28] with us now give everybody Lord a good
[1:30:30] safe trip home be with each one Lord we
