TRANSCRIPT
========================================
don't throw a book revelation that what you want to do that was the next thing that was suggested yes we need to all keep brother and sister Tatum Stella and and there was a tree phone or house there okay it broke the whole freshman up porch off the house when the tree fell yeah the brother duck said the tree didn't fall over the house it fell right down the side it just keeps me brave with all the rain that had he said they had no leaks inside the house so that's the grace for diving that rain we get a life yesterday you run out for you went out flower good to get it back up they went on a football on our came good doing that hi Eddie are young as you might with the congregation well until Joe go all right let's just remember that and keep people in the prayers or so some trying time for everybody we all we all know what we're headed toward but I think if we get fortified behind the word enough that all these other things will fall into place because somebody's gonna make somebody's gonna make it yes right so we're just gonna declare that we're the one who's gonna make it some yes here's Paul in Philippians rent Flint it's three we're gonna try to get finished today that's okay if by any means Paul's talking about now we stopped right here excuse me I'm warmer Paul is trying to tell the people yeah a good time our first our first fruit of the what you want to call youth youth revival or youth whatever you want to call it brothers i blacks being baptized this afternoon so yeah he's got a wonderful testimony to you and gave me a little bit of it yes be a big baptize years ago yes this is not the first one but that's okay he he'll tell you a second one let him tell it's by any means I may attain to the resurrection of the Dead then what we're talking about Paul is telling the people that there's a resurrection but now the people he's talking to remember don't have the Bible to reference back like we do to where Paul's saying that will resurrect is sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus not that see what Paul and brother branham makes this statement he says Paul is trying to get it out of people's mind that it's not the resurrection of the Dead there is not a resurrection in Paul's age the resurrection is in our age but he's prophesying are pointing forward to a resurrection time to where there is a resurrection of the dead but Paul obviously when he got struck down at going to Damascus the rivers going he was three days blind then and nice prayed for me and received the Holy Ghost so that was his resurrection the old Paul died Saul died and Paul resurrected that's what he's trying to tell people but if you were just listening to Paul preached today if I by any means I might attain them to the resurrection of the Dead Paul's preaching there's going to be a resurrection but then Paul tells in other places to put them together that it's resurrected sitting in heavenly places it's not going to be a resurrection now there were some people raised from the dead but he's talking about a resurrection of the dead for everybody all right not as though I had already attained either we're already perfect see we said I'm not perfect this is this resurrection is going to bring out people they're perfect there's going to be a perfect people on earth and there's going to be a perfect people it's going to be resurrected okay they're already perfect but I'll follow after in other words he's coming you'll be up in the resurrection no doubt of the bride not just a general resurrection the several resurrection I'd like to cover that maybe sometimes they stay committee resurrection but there's this one is you've already resurrected because the Bible says the dead in Christ shall rise first will you died in Christ you didn't die in Christ when we put you in the grave you die in Christ yesterday whenever you were born again when you died yeah you're already resurrected you're already sitting in heavenly places you can't die you just fall asleep as they did when they stoned Stephen instead he fell asleep there was others from the Bible did that fell asleep all right not as though I'd already obtained either we're already perfect but I follow after the word I'm coming after this if that I may apprehend that probably also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus now what's apprehending it means lay hold of that which also I'm apprehended are laying hold of Christ notice he got to hold the Christ and he was resurrected from the dead sitting in heavenly places when you put all the scriptures together resurrected stood in heavenly places where in Christ Jesus there is no resurrection outside of Jesus Christ none zero the devil can't resurrect anybody that's right guys got a resurrect brethren I count not myself to Apple to have attained to but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before we're gonna talk about a little bit this afternoon about the zeal you got a zeal for God then that's the things that you're reaching forth and I like what brother Ron say it brother Brown said he said he said God I prayed that my wisdom will take hold of my zeal because you can be a zealot are zealous her people do things wrong a zealot just goes out blinded and do you know about no but the brother Brown said let then other words like the Holy Ghost take my zeal and keep it that's right you know because one without the other is not good yeah vanna zealot and the Bible was not good they went out kill people yeah can you read that again we all right brethren I count not myself to have apprehended what lay hold of what I resurrect he's not holding the record I am right then but this one thing I do is his point leave it right there but this one thing I do come up forgetting those things which are behind that's what - brother Nathaniel was talking about Sunday a lot of got a lot of positive a lot of positive reviews on that we're all under reviews you know me and June are going to spend a few days in Clayton and we'd just go through and say put in restaurants and what did the reviews say we never had those reviews we just had word of mouth but now you can read the reviews well that's what he was reviewing all the things that he needs not prohibited he has not apprehended the erection yet though he's waiting he does that for him the resurrection inside of it but he said this thing I'm going to do until that happens for getting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before reaching before reaching forth unto those things which are before what if your evolution revelation upon Revelation look now look don't say that's not before your thinking before ya know looking for those which things which are before me in front of me I had okay so that clears it up a little bit there you got it now ya know not always things are before we look you thinking forward sometimes nots not looking back before it's looking that way all right so that's what he said that's when he's trying to have her hand he's looking to the things are before not the things that are behind because the public that things were behind he'd kill himself right he would be literally killed Christian people and now he's commissioned to preach to that same group of people and put him in a bride yeah and get them eternal life the thing he was persecuted was the thing that saved it so I don't think now I know Paul in his humanity I believe that slain went to Rome I believe he knew that his time was up he knew that he was gonna die he was done he had finished his race I'm telling you because he told us he said I finished my race I'm going to fight a crown of life is left for me but he I'm sure he was just like all of us the devil reminded him of when he did the Stephen and what he did to all the Christians causing them to blaspheme going into churches and just tearing them up put them in jail right right thank you but what did he do go on I press toward the mark there was a mark he was pressing toward our goal same thing for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus let us therefore as many as be perfect or what complete mature Paul was a very mature Christian because he had those people in Ephesus he had a very mature group to work with he saw the power of done and that's the same way what we're trying to do here in this church we're trying to bring even the young ones up to a level of maturity all of us come to a level of maturity so God can use us he can't use yunalesca maturity that's what I mean you can't give a baby a key to the car you can't tell the baby to go build a house but through maturity I was thinking the other day well yesterday all the people in just in this church not including another church's thing where God's put you know Joseph counted in lieu in brother Bob and all the ones who worked on computers they didn't know that was gonna they weren't going to this church when they were taking classes were you Joe might have been but I don't think so no he was not but God was grooming them to get a good-paying job but to be able to help us get the word out so same way with all of these you said well I'm just you're just what you're a copier child to God everything you do in touch and say it's for things of God he knows what you're gonna do you just gotta go do it he quit us in each situation to where he even maybe one person it's what me and Bob were talking about Wednesday night after service if that black is the only person that realized he was lost realized he wasn't doing things right because of what's been going on in them in the youth meetings we could stop today and be a success right but you stop today I'm be a successful but I don't want it look Paul said no words no what Paul same I could be a success I think if I just stop I've already apprehended I've already put Christ in my life and I'll preach the gospel because remember in Philippians he's heading toward the end of his time so he knows that he is what he has established churches he's done all things he needs to do Sammy with you and I what'd he do he said no I'm not going to retire and just go live and you know go to Tarsus where I was born a retired nurse at home no he was first 14 I press toward the mark that's right even though knowing that when he went to Rome he wasn't coming back he knew that he stayed in Rome for two years before they could have heaven so he could write the letters and what he could be a help to the people in Rome yeah I've always looked at this one thing you take Paul he went to Rome to talk to what Caesar you appeal to Caesar that he was a Roman he was at the back he was at the Roman city he was at the Vatican that that what no Vatican at that time but that was becoming the seat of Satan yeah don't worry brother branham do beat him being the Alpha messenger brother Graham being the Omega messenger the inside messenger where'd he go he went to Rome right could you imagine a prophet walking into that Vatican and looking and seeing him in another dimension but all in demons hanging in that building so he said he walked right up to the triple crown he said he looked at it just pre inch it from his head so it was in that little glass box so he toured the Vatican but he didn't get remember he was going to get a will that a bit something can you imagine them demons looking at and seeing them prophets like what I'm a because I found salmon they be looking down and handling you doing here not knowing what you're doing here yeah but could you imagine if you met the Pope but remember he wasn't gonna do that I'm sure he liked me because of he's not gonna honor calling brother Jake his ham but that wasn't gonna happen you got a kiss ring before you know anything but why did Paul do Paul kept pressing he stayed two years in Rome know anyone coming back home and why he kept writing letters he kept writing and a lady actually that's what's kind of strange they allowed I've been reading in in the book of items they allow Paul he was like on house arrest he wasn't in a prison he was like in a house and he had a guard with him and even even Festus or whoever plus said well I'll let him go in and out let me see people how people come in and out you know but they're getting ready to cut his head off so Paul knew that but he said I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus each one of us had been on high calling each one of us should be able to now know what that calling is right because the Bible says make your wife calling and election sure right let us therefore as many as be perfect or what not or are grown up be thus minded in other words think just like this and if in anything you'd be otherwise minded God shall reveal even listen to you I mean somebody's talking the other day was talking about the Holy Ghost you know we you sometimes we don't come say that's right we don't use the Holy Ghost our advantage because he said I will lead to you and guide you and all truth now if there's not a truth there you already immediately know that's not the Holy Oh turn away don't entertain it okay like John entertained it only I hope ours will get into brother Brown city the Bible says he admired that church why she was a beautiful woman which was groaned that the the mother so all that stuff we might leave my hand on thanks look we'll talk about this later but I was telling them the involves talking about something and I said this place is kind of like assembling this long there's full of people right we got to learn to deal with coming in on sentient being in this submarine you know this round tube that we had we worship in so these things that we need to do to to help it so long as we realize that we're all sailors we're staying don't sing something brethren be followers together of me and mark them which walk as you have thus for an example arm example pattern now he's interpolating here remember question come in no exclamation point not exclamation point bread States for many walk of them might have told you often and now tell you even weeping that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ in other words they walk with us my brother Dale's preaching on anointed ones they walk with us but there's somewhere whose end is destruction whose God is their belly and whose glory is in their shame who mind earthly things money think about this other day you think of all the things that are going on you drop you can draw down to three things programs in money women in popularity now you say women well no it may not be adultery but you commit spiritual adultery and it be the same demon right yeah and then false doctrine is a is a commitment okay so Paul sees this whose end is destruction whose God is their belly and glory is in their shame who mind earthly things when our conversation is in heaven from whence also we look for the Savior the Lord Christ who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body so come on said will have a body locked into this glorious body we're not going all like look like Jesus right think I look like you but it will be fashioned in a glorified condition like Jesus's body is right now in the glorified condition and then you're not gonna lose your you're gonna be who you are all right who should change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself so in other words when Jesus Christ walked out of the tomb peace at all power to him there's been given unto me so he goes to the right hand of the Father what does he do to stay there fall asleep no he says the Holy Ghost done 14 in my name I'll send the Holy Ghost back and he'll lead you and guide you in all truth yes now listen we might get confused dad never come like this other day you may get confused do not go continue in confusion if you got the Holy Ghost that's right you cannot if you continue in confusion you need to listen to that Black's testimony and get baptized again receive the baptism the Holy Ghost called about listen the Holy Ghost is not confused we got it we got a God in this message he changes his mind every week we got a Holy Ghost that allows people did whatever they wanted well that's way it isn't the message we've just becoming a bunch of Catholics I don't say this I say what's happening out there they take every fault often in the world in and it ain't even I mean badness like they say the bad wouldn't do what long people in the message called the message today right the worshipping brother branham brother Bob sent me a link over Africa they got shrine over brother differently well they did the same thing Apollo they were ones they've done it to everybody it's all ketosis and all well it's not really Catholicism it's the devil working through that system that's why Jesus said in Revelation they're ready to go wins tonight these are the next leggings I hate you say God no hey VA does he said he hated that thing alright and that's what's been the Nicolaitans spirit in this message that took over but if we're fortified behind the word that's was thinking a couple days ago it were fortified behind the word it's not so easy for the devil to get to it but remember remember Eve relevant that Eve had to come out from behind the word to be to see I didn't talk to you theory until next time thank you very we're not going pro but you see what happened if we stay fortified behind the word just stay there that's what Paul's saying stand there be zealous yes dude do the first works does will read in Revelations where go back and do the first work you know it would be good for us to just sit one day and go back in and think about the first week or month or year that you got born again if you can't remember it you need to get born again then you can start over alright but if you can remember that how God led you through different things told you many times before he let he lead you through things and then all of a sudden if you just like Doc died or went on vacation okay what's he doing that for child train just like with with children and all that is it's good to nurture and love Ellie but now not forbidding if it gets 16 years and she turns 16 years old Joe she don't be a tease somehow anyway but God forbid that that that you turn around look at this picture of this beautiful child but eight sixteen years from now she's still laying there with a bottle of money that's what we've become a lot of to become we just become babies and stay babies God wants us to grow up and I got a grandchild too and I love her to death but there's a time in life that you can't share from like you think you need to you got to turn loose give them to God first all y'all got kids coming up you you know it's good to Cheryl from but without God's protection that's it but that's why we all pray for them that's why every day twice a bleep race either people rep you on that wall that's what I tell you when I'm standing in the pulpit which is really about right here but right out there about the first road there's in that name right down below us and we need to pray for the people there for my brother Billy beloved we're not gonna get to this all get just a few and then we'll finish there for my brothers dearly beloved and long for my joy and Crown now look who is his joint crown member what brother Ram said he said you're the jewel my crown we are where the jewels in the crown of brother branham because he's going to get a crown go see the star I don't were these people I'd like to ask so many people that don't think brother Ryan was the 7:13 you mess with your who coming here what forever lations 10% if i want to stay in the bible in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when you begin there's got to be a voice yeah that's what I want to ask you is he who do you think is are you it and it's not Jesus Christ good thing I read the Bible that Jesus don't come back in physical form until right until the Millenium so for the messenger in Revelation chapter 3 wala to bathe us and I love the music who's that well that's what I want to ask them you say let's get back to the Bible okay tell me what I think 10-7 me who is that boy it's either that they don't believe it they won't believe that scripture or they or they just they don't they think it's Dan themselves or somebody else coming up in a head you know well and truly yeah I said before these people that do now the message see they close the model if you can't preach they they say let's just give back and preach the Bible they just don't realize they shut that book back up they have because what are they preaching then I preached in an open book because the snow angel messenger in the days of the voice that open book was give the gun let's try all right but then you got the people say well in Revelations 8 1 when the seventh seal was open still silence in heaven so nobody knows what's going on you know they don't God can't reveal something to them like that yeah God only reveals to people that will receive the word and that our receptors of the word remember what's the what's the Holy Ghost if you can receive the message where your day not just receive it in your ears set up here and die no you gotta get out there live and then drop down and then what open the eyes of my heart let us see what's going on therefore my brethren dearly beloved in long for my joy and Crown so stand fast in the Lord my dearly beloved I beseech you this and beseech syntek that they be of the same mind in the Lord and I entreat the also true your fellows or what their yoke with him there in there not two companions there not division I'm telling you a division is a reason we're not having a revival right we need to shut up and look up and look up what pops ain't forgetting the things that are in the past how are you going to change them you know what Paul would probably say Lord if you just let me go back and change two years of my life of when I persecuted those Christian and gods like no that was you yeah that's your testimony that's what you did so that you can now say that it wasn't God that did that and now you're bringing these people in my fellow young fella my fellow servants help those women what's labeled men the gospel with Clement also with others my fellow laborers whose name during the book of life way that great Paul knew whose name was in the book of life well if you're born again you named another life right rejoicing the hallway and again I say rejoice let your moderation be known to all man you were good in gentleness be known to all men the Lord is at hand be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God pray without ceasing and the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds hearts your soul and your mind through Christ Jesus finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue or what our strength to this and if there be any praise think on these things that's where brother Dale gets that quote from he likes that think on these things notice what Paul good he's telling it stop for a minute think about it think about what's going on whatsoever things are true honest you need to check those off true and honest just pure lovely good report if there be any virtue let praise there can be industry being praise think on these things those things which he have both learned and received and heard seen in me dude Wow and the God of peace shall be with you but I rejoiced in the Lord greatly now that the last year care of me has flourished again worrying you were also careful but she lacked opportunity not that I speak in respect to long so they don't want anything but I've learned in whatsoever slain I am therefore be content can we say that no wait a minute there by the way you just said Paul said I press on to the mark of a college now he's telling us to be content what we're doing you got to get them you know to get the revelation to that be content with what you got but you better use what you've got for the glory of God it's to press on to the mark of the high calling I know both how to be abased and other words what is the base be lowly live humbly and I know how to about which is a little opposite live in prosperity he's done both everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound in to suffer need I think we'll save that last part let's go enjoy I want to try to make sure we get up at 10:15 every service will make sure you I don't go you know for them
