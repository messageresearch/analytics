[11:40] you
[11:43] pour out your power and love if we sing
[12:19] kind of a
[12:20] funny thing for a pastor to be in the
[12:22] bed 24 days
[12:24] come out and tell the songwriter to cut
[12:26] the service short
[12:28] but it's not my fault
[12:30] he should not have made me sick that's
[12:32] right
[12:36] thanks mike might have been another few
[12:38] services or something to
[12:41] what i want to become
[12:42] but i appreciate
[12:44] all of you for praying
[12:46] and uh
[12:47] and why she
[12:49] you know she kept on asking me
[12:52] see you boy
[12:56] we got to get you the doctor
[12:58] i said well i've done been and
[13:00] everything but it
[13:02] didn't seem to be working
[13:04] but
[13:05] every monday night
[13:07] when everybody got to pray
[13:10] in 30 minutes
[13:11] my temperature went from 100 to
[13:14] 4 10 to 99.
[13:26] it's over don't worry about it sure i
[13:29] went to the doctor monday
[13:31] i mean tuesday
[13:32] i went over to the doctor sure he gave
[13:34] me a couple of shots and all kinds of
[13:36] things but that bothered me
[13:38] didn't bother my faith either
[13:41] see
[13:42] gary when you said it said you said it
[13:44] would be a way
[13:45] you just want to try a little bit you
[13:47] know hold on
[13:49] don't look at it when it don't happen
[13:51] but don't look at it bad when it does
[13:54] happen all right we won't read ephesians
[13:56] 1 tonight because we've got a long
[13:57] reading proverbs
[14:00] the 8th chapter
[14:02] kind of an odd reading now for
[14:05] what i won't speak on
[14:07] because we're going over to the book of
[14:09] job
[14:10] but this is a very odd reading because
[14:13] what my point is i want you to see
[14:18] that what we've been trying to say
[14:20] and we won't be on the so you take the
[14:23] notes on will you now what you want to
[14:25] on what we were talking about attributes
[14:28] and thoughts and things like that we
[14:30] will not be using them tonight that's
[14:31] why we we've moved over
[14:34] all right because after thinking about
[14:36] it quite a while
[14:38] i believe that you've got enough
[14:39] understanding about thoughts and
[14:41] attributes and things we'll mention it a
[14:43] little but then we'll try to move on
[14:45] into something else but i want you to
[14:48] see how that someone would catch a
[14:50] thought
[14:53] and then it's like wade said what what
[14:55] does god first do first does it
[14:59] reveal it
[15:00] you know and then makes it manifest all
[15:02] right
[15:03] now so in that
[15:05] we want to see you know that you can see
[15:07] something
[15:09] but sometimes you have to wait right for
[15:12] the answer to come to what you're doing
[15:13] and all like that but that's that's just
[15:15] what we want to do so let's pray father
[15:17] we thank you
[15:18] we ask you to just be with us tonight in
[15:20] your love give us strength
[15:22] but most of all give us spirit spiritual
[15:24] understanding in our hearts and our
[15:27] minds we love you
[15:28] we thank you thank you for a group of
[15:30] people to stay with you and pray for you
[15:32] when you really need it lord
[15:34] and just
[15:35] teach us
[15:37] that understanding
[15:39] let your love be with us in jesus name
[15:43] all right this is the whole chapter i
[15:45] said i was going to use this on the
[15:46] weekend and have brother collier use it
[15:48] as a
[15:49] you know
[15:50] for a responsive reading because it'd
[15:53] been so long but
[15:56] now i want you to get the point
[16:00] as you're reading through here with me
[16:04] this is talking about wisdom
[16:07] all right
[16:08] but now who's wisdom
[16:11] so you'll see him keep saying i
[16:14] i
[16:15] me
[16:16] i
[16:17] wisdom
[16:19] it's not the wisdom of man's mind see
[16:22] that's right
[16:23] this just read with me and think about
[16:26] what it says if you've got a scofield
[16:27] bible it says in praise of wisdom
[16:30] all right but that's what we need wisdom
[16:33] now not
[16:34] natural
[16:35] understanding we need revelation that's
[16:37] right yeah all right so let's read now
[16:40] does not wisdom cry and understanding
[16:43] put forth her voice
[16:45] she stands in the top of high places by
[16:48] the way in the places of the past
[16:51] she crowded the gates after entering the
[16:54] gates after coming in in at the door see
[16:56] if you just read one of these scriptures
[16:58] by yourself you think somebody's
[16:59] standing by a gate so i'm doing this
[17:00] somebody doing that but get it wisdom is
[17:03] coming in
[17:04] all right and it's talking about wisdom
[17:08] unto you o men are called and my voice
[17:11] is to the sons of men
[17:14] i think that'll defeat us
[17:16] oh ye simple understand wisdom
[17:19] and you fools
[17:21] be
[17:22] of an understanding heart
[17:25] here for i speak of excellent things and
[17:28] the openings
[17:30] opening of my lips shall be right things
[17:33] for my mouth shall speak truth and
[17:36] wisdom is an abomination to my lips
[17:40] all the words of my mouth are in
[17:41] righteousness
[17:43] there is nothing forward or perverse in
[17:46] them
[17:47] they are all plain to him that
[17:49] understandeth and write to them that
[17:52] find knowledge
[17:54] receive my instructions and not silver
[17:57] and knowledge rather than choice gold
[18:00] wisdom is better than rubies and all the
[18:03] things that may be desired are not to be
[18:05] compared to it
[18:08] i wisdom dweller prudence
[18:10] and find out knowledge of witty
[18:13] inventions now wait a sunday
[18:17] when we get on that okay
[18:22] the fear of the lord is to hate evil
[18:24] pride and arrogancy and the evil way in
[18:27] the forward mouth do i hate
[18:30] counsel is mine
[18:32] and sound wisdom i am understanding i
[18:35] have strength
[18:38] by me kings reign and princesses princes
[18:41] decreed justice i made princesses rule
[18:46] and nobles even all the judges of the
[18:48] earth
[18:49] i love them that love me and those that
[18:51] seek me early shall find me
[18:54] amen riches and honor are you are with
[18:58] me
[18:59] yea durable riches and righteousness
[19:02] my fruit is better than gold yay then
[19:04] fine gold and
[19:06] my
[19:07] revenue than choice silver
[19:10] i lead in the way of righteousness in
[19:12] the midst of the paths of judgment
[19:14] that it may cause those that love me to
[19:16] inherit substance
[19:18] and i will fill their treasures
[19:21] the lord notice big capital
[19:23] possess me in the beginning of his way
[19:30] he possessed in the beginning
[19:33] before his works of old
[19:35] i was set up from everlasting from the
[19:38] beginning
[19:39] or even or ever the earth was
[19:42] when there was no depths i was brought
[19:45] forth
[19:46] when there were no fountains abounding
[19:48] with water
[19:52] before the mountains were settled
[19:54] before the hills was i brought forth
[19:58] well as yet he had not made
[20:01] the earth
[20:03] nor the
[20:04] fields nor the highest parts of the dust
[20:07] of the world
[20:09] when he prepared the heavens i was there
[20:12] amen when he set a compass upon the face
[20:14] of the dead
[20:16] when he established the clouds above
[20:19] when he strengthened the fountains of
[20:21] the deep
[20:22] when he gave to the sea his decree what
[20:25] the water should not pass his
[20:27] commandment
[20:28] when he appointed the foundations of the
[20:31] earth
[20:32] then i was by him
[20:34] as one brought up with him
[20:37] and i was daily his delight
[20:40] rejoicing always before him
[20:43] rejoicing in the habitual part of his
[20:45] earth
[20:46] and my delights were with the sons of
[20:48] men
[20:50] now therefore hearken unto me o you
[20:52] children
[20:53] for blessed are they that keep my ways
[20:57] here instructions and be wise and refuse
[20:59] it not
[21:00] blessed is the man that heareth me
[21:03] watching daily excuse me blessed is a
[21:06] man that heareth me watching daily in my
[21:08] gates
[21:10] waiting at the post of my doors
[21:12] for
[21:13] whosoever find it life and shall obtain
[21:17] favor of the lord
[21:19] but he that sinneth against me
[21:23] wrong hit wrong with his own soul and
[21:25] they that hate me
[21:27] love
[21:28] death you may be seated the lord had a
[21:30] blessing to the reading of the word i
[21:32] wish you would
[21:33] go over that you better bring back some
[21:35] water too
[21:37] we should go over that
[21:40] reading and just you know
[21:42] just
[21:44] keep going over and over
[21:47] and uh
[21:48] because you'll you'll see more about
[21:49] especially this coming sunday
[21:52] of what i want to speak on like i said
[21:54] the devil shouldn't have got a hold of
[21:56] me because
[21:57] you know it gives me too much time to
[22:00] lay around and think
[22:01] and i love to think
[22:04] so
[22:05] you know like i said if i didn't get
[22:07] enough on that attributes and thoughts
[22:10] then uh
[22:11] just remember what we were trying to
[22:13] bring
[22:14] that god's attributes
[22:17] is his word
[22:20] it's his person
[22:22] and we
[22:23] we believe that he was a healer a savior
[22:26] a redeemer
[22:28] and he had those attributes always
[22:31] he didn't gain attributes coming this
[22:33] way he displayed attributes coming
[22:37] this way
[22:38] creations etc
[22:40] displayed the attributes but he always
[22:43] was a father a savior a healer if we
[22:47] believe in one god he would always
[22:48] father son in the holy ghost it was just
[22:50] that he had never displayed himself
[22:53] upon the earth to a human mortal
[22:56] and he had never uh you know
[22:59] sickness had never come into being
[23:01] healing these salvations and things had
[23:03] never come into being but that didn't
[23:06] mean that it wasn't part of him because
[23:08] he gained an attribute coming here
[23:11] then that would add to him as we were
[23:14] trying to say
[23:15] and that he cannot unders cannot add to
[23:17] his understanding he is not like you and
[23:20] i as a people
[23:23] you know
[23:23] he can't have a thought and have a
[23:25] better thought
[23:27] or a better idea or concept he can only
[23:32] you know do then what he says
[23:35] and that we can depend on it
[23:37] if you find it in the word
[23:40] then you can can actually bring god on
[23:42] the scene the prophet said
[23:44] and said
[23:45] call him a liar now that's that's hard
[23:48] words for us human mortals
[23:50] call you said if he said
[23:52] if you find it in god's word you can
[23:54] call him on the scene and said if he
[23:56] doesn't do it he said you can call him a
[23:58] liar
[24:01] you say well that's too strong that's no
[24:04] what is it
[24:06] i mean do you want a lot
[24:09] you know
[24:09] i mean would you lie to save your own
[24:11] neck
[24:13] of course 99.99
[24:17] would but
[24:18] you know
[24:19] a christian or not even think about
[24:21] whether they lie or not that's right
[24:24] you know that's that's just the way we
[24:26] it shouldn't be it shouldn't be any
[24:27] thoughts in us because god won't lie
[24:30] but his thoughts are eternal and part of
[24:32] him
[24:33] well then if we ever had eternal life
[24:36] if we ever if you know if we have
[24:38] eternal life tonight the prophet said
[24:40] what we always was eternal what not us
[24:44] not our being i gave you those quotes
[24:47] not what we are
[24:49] you know by spirit and soul beings that
[24:51] comes over into the fallen condition
[24:54] but that eternal life that we have in us
[24:57] never had a beginning
[25:04] so it's you know keep it into that
[25:06] thought all right and all that we're
[25:08] talking about now has been
[25:11] taking place
[25:13] before the foundation of the world
[25:15] that's right all right
[25:17] now before anything was
[25:20] the things we've been talking about were
[25:22] already there
[25:24] and in doing that i want you to to
[25:27] listen especially to
[25:30] the first three quotes
[25:33] and then i want you to record them for
[25:36] for a background or a thought upon where
[25:39] we start on sunday because
[25:43] this will do one of true things
[25:47] this will
[25:49] open doors to
[25:51] the understanding
[25:53] or it will close the doors that's why i
[25:56] read that of wisdom
[25:59] see
[26:00] wisdom
[26:01] is a great thing
[26:03] even natural wisdom
[26:05] even human wisdom
[26:07] it's a great thing
[26:10] there's people who have photographic
[26:11] memories
[26:13] but you know the biggest problem with
[26:14] them they don't have enough sense to
[26:16] open the door
[26:17] but they got a photographic memory as
[26:19] far as what they read and and things
[26:21] like that in here
[26:22] well i'd rather be like me at least i
[26:24] can open the door
[26:26] but the lord has to take my memory
[26:28] and keep it straight don't you all right
[26:31] but now see this tonight will still be
[26:34] up in heaven
[26:36] so i want your thoughts
[26:39] in the beginning to be upon one thing
[26:43] that
[26:45] there is just one true and living god
[26:49] there can't be a trinity
[26:50] and it can't be as the people of the
[26:52] messenger making it now a twoness or
[26:54] whatever form of saying that jesus was
[26:57] one identity and god was another and you
[27:00] know trying to explain things and i'm
[27:02] not throwing off on them i've always
[27:04] told you that i never thought of i'd
[27:06] rather see somebody run wildfire than no
[27:09] fire
[27:11] i'd probably say it i mean
[27:13] you don't warm by a painted fire but at
[27:16] least you can get a little something out
[27:17] of one that's running out of wild you
[27:19] know so i'd rather see it i i i don't
[27:22] appreciate the era that anyone's in but
[27:24] i appreciate at least they're trying
[27:28] brotherdale's never been that away you
[27:30] know that from from every time you've
[27:31] ever seen me or hurt me
[27:33] i'm not against what these people are
[27:35] saying they're a lot better off than
[27:37] well we don't get the deep stuff now now
[27:39] we want to get confused so we just stay
[27:42] simple with the prophet's message and we
[27:44] just listen to what he has to say and
[27:47] and if you don't read exactly what he
[27:48] says it now you've missed it you know
[27:51] well
[27:52] all right that's everybody's place
[27:55] i was looking at something will be
[27:56] brought out the lord willing sunday
[27:59] that brother brown was talking about how
[28:02] that when this thing came forth it came
[28:04] like say that when it starts say the
[28:06] lutherans and the methodists and then
[28:08] the pentecostals and then the the
[28:10] going on into where we're supposed to be
[28:13] and he says
[28:14] there's the the the horse and buggy he
[28:16] said that's luther's name you know he
[28:18] said then the automobile maybe if i get
[28:20] these wrong you put them in the right
[28:21] place but he said like wesley in them
[28:23] you know it was like an automobile it
[28:25] was horsepower but he said then we hit
[28:27] the pentecostals and he said it began
[28:30] what would be known as the flying age of
[28:33] getting above ground resurrected he said
[28:35] sitting in heavenly places enjoying the
[28:38] things of god but he said we've moved on
[28:40] now we are into the astronaut age
[28:44] and he said in the astronaut age someone
[28:48] is going to have to fly off and he said
[28:50] john glenn went out
[28:52] you know and came back and thing but he
[28:54] said and he's bringing it out and in
[28:56] another message he says interplanetary
[28:59] travel
[29:00] which is not going to the moon would say
[29:02] like i think that's the exact quote so
[29:03] we'll try to get it
[29:05] that going to the moon would is a type
[29:07] of the rapture
[29:09] because see we're leaving these
[29:10] dimensions
[29:12] and going away but he said now don't
[29:14] blame the man right this up here said
[29:17] he's up here the astronaut that's right
[29:19] but he said you know what the guy's
[29:21] driving the horse's butt he doesn't
[29:22] understand
[29:24] he said he's life and said that can't be
[29:26] sold
[29:28] i mean
[29:29] even the guy with a car
[29:31] he said even the people flying into
[29:33] planes
[29:34] he said
[29:36] don't make light of them
[29:38] they've got their place
[29:40] we see this i don't make light of nobody
[29:42] all right
[29:43] so let's go along and get what we're
[29:45] talking about
[29:50] we know that for a certainty
[29:54] that
[29:57] there is just one truly living god
[30:01] all right
[30:02] and we're not oneness
[30:04] you'll see that more and more sunday as
[30:06] we try to bring it out
[30:10] we're not a oneness group of people
[30:12] we use the forms of god
[30:15] and the bride is to be the life form of
[30:17] god
[30:18] before the rapture comes that's right
[30:20] all right and then there will be a forum
[30:22] go to israel i've taught you that so
[30:24] we're not trying to get into a oneness
[30:27] form we're trying to get into what the
[30:28] prophet had to say so let's start with
[30:30] this reading you have to i'll read real
[30:32] fast tonight and
[30:34] if we're here at 12 i'm sorry and i i'm
[30:36] not kidding
[30:39] i want to get this out
[30:41] okay
[30:44] investments 1963 11 16 to be
[30:48] paragraph 60. he's talking about the
[30:51] policy of the talk and talking this
[30:53] morning it's eternal life
[30:55] everlasting life anything that's eternal
[30:57] never did begin therefore it cannot end
[31:01] eternal never begins and then the way
[31:03] the only way that you can be eternal is
[31:05] to receive eternal life and there is
[31:08] only one thing eternal and that's god
[31:11] not by joining a church or a creed or
[31:13] turning a newspaper
[31:15] on new year's
[31:16] you know wait till my new resolution or
[31:19] whatever it is but it's receiving god
[31:23] the person of god
[31:25] in the form of the holy ghost into your
[31:27] life
[31:28] and you become part of god
[31:31] and just as eternal as he is
[31:34] because you are
[31:35] you're a part of him everything has a
[31:37] beginning has an end the world begins it
[31:41] ends
[31:42] heaven begins
[31:45] you know that
[31:47] you know it ends
[31:49] but you better be careful right
[31:52] you might be surprised sunday
[31:55] we got bible
[31:58] jesus said heavens and earth will pass
[32:00] away but my word shall never
[32:03] because he is the word
[32:05] he is the word and that is eternal okay
[32:08] one day shalom 1964
[32:11] 112 paragraph seven jesus
[32:15] no man has seen god at any time but the
[32:17] only begotten of the father had declared
[32:18] him see in other words god was
[32:20] identified
[32:22] the the person of god was identified in
[32:24] the body the lord jesus christ so he was
[32:27] ex the express image of god
[32:30] or god expressing himself through an
[32:33] image see through an image man
[32:36] god expressed himself to us and he was
[32:39] god not a third person a second person
[32:42] he was the person god he was god himself
[32:46] identifying himself so we could feel him
[32:50] first timothy 3 16 without
[32:52] controversy that's argument great is the
[32:54] mystery of godliness because god was for
[32:57] god was manifested or made known in the
[32:59] flesh isn't that wonderful
[33:02] god and we could never understand god as
[33:05] he moved through a pillar of fire and so
[33:08] forth as he did
[33:11] but we understood him when he become one
[33:14] of us see
[33:16] when he became become man
[33:19] then he could talk to us he could feel
[33:21] us handle us touches everything as the
[33:23] scripture plainly says that we have
[33:25] handled god see with our hands touched
[33:28] him
[33:29] with our hands now you know what i've
[33:31] always taught you
[33:33] the person of god
[33:36] how are you going to explain it when
[33:38] that brother branham would tell you
[33:40] the person of god is the baptism of the
[33:42] holy ghost that comes into you right
[33:45] every person in the world today 7
[33:47] billion could receive the baptism of the
[33:48] holy ghost and that would be 7 billion
[33:52] persons of god
[33:53] amen and it'd still be the same person
[33:58] you agree he'd be the same person
[34:01] he wouldn't be another person
[34:03] because you're making trinities if he's
[34:05] a person we're a person there's a
[34:06] trinity you know what i've said the
[34:08] eternal life you receive the eternal
[34:10] life life i receive is the person of
[34:12] jesus christ
[34:14] all right so we better start believing
[34:16] that god is more real than we think
[34:19] i've got one in here somewhere but
[34:20] uh oh okay we'll go on this some of this
[34:22] one
[34:24] who is this melchizedek 65
[34:26] 221 the evening service notice those who
[34:29] have tonight eternal life was with him
[34:32] and in him in his thinking before there
[34:36] ever was an angel star cherubim or
[34:38] anything else that's eternal
[34:41] and if you have eternal life you always
[34:44] was look man not your being here right
[34:47] now it's plain enough
[34:49] not your being here but the shape and
[34:52] form that the infinite god
[34:55] and if he isn't infinite he isn't god
[34:58] god has to be infinite
[35:00] we are finite he is infinite
[35:03] and he was on the present omniscient
[35:05] omnipotent
[35:06] if he isn't god then he can't be god
[35:10] if he isn't then he can't be god
[35:12] knows all things all places because of
[35:15] his omnipresence omniscience makes him
[35:18] omnipresent
[35:20] he is a being he's not like the wind
[35:23] he is a being listen he dwells in a
[35:26] house
[35:30] no no he's in my heart
[35:32] amen
[35:35] because the house is in heaven too
[35:38] god being the mission knows all things
[35:40] makes him on the present because he
[35:41] knows everything that's going on there
[35:44] can't be a fleet that decides but what
[35:46] he noted and he noted because before
[35:49] there was a world how many times did
[35:52] time it bat its eye and how much tower
[35:54] it had in it before there ever was a
[35:56] world that's infinite
[35:59] we can't comprehend it in our mind but
[36:02] that's god
[36:03] god
[36:04] infinite amen
[36:07] all right now
[36:09] that's one
[36:11] lock it in
[36:14] and you'll see that when we come through
[36:16] at sunday it'll be lord willing if i can
[36:18] make it through it the way that i see it
[36:20] we'll see a whole lot more than we've
[36:22] ever seen about the godhead and we'll
[36:24] see a whole lot more than we've ever
[36:25] seen about us heads
[36:29] that's right but number two
[36:33] do you believe it's a heaven
[36:38] well a lot of people thanks all those
[36:39] things to do is come down here i'm
[36:40] talking about people in the message you
[36:41] know
[36:43] hell's here and this is here and that's
[36:44] there and everything you know
[36:49] but do you really believe
[36:52] in heaven being real
[36:59] a real place
[37:04] so much greater above this until this is
[37:06] a garbage can
[37:10] a cesspool
[37:13] the most beautiful you could go and i
[37:15] love to hunt to work especially going
[37:17] somewhere that you hadn't been and you
[37:19] get back into the woods or something and
[37:21] just they're in colorado and just just
[37:23] walk down through there and think lord
[37:26] it's so wonderful to be out here
[37:28] ain't nobody around for miles and then
[37:30] about the time you stumble over
[37:31] something
[37:33] beer can
[37:48] he starts off talking on things that are
[37:50] to be 1965 1202 and he start talking
[37:53] about
[37:54] how the old-timers used to be about
[37:56] living about heaven and about the things
[37:59] and all
[38:00] and and if i'd i'd ask you a question to
[38:02] go look up for sunday
[38:05] brother random said paul went to the
[38:06] third heaven
[38:08] he said i went to the first
[38:11] there's two opposition quotes you better
[38:13] hold close together when you get in
[38:15] there because one of them is talking
[38:17] about a dimensional situation and one of
[38:20] them is talking about the millennium
[38:27] brotherhood said i went to the first
[38:28] heaven
[38:31] the prophet said the first heaven is the
[38:33] millennium
[38:35] the first earth is now
[38:37] they pass away
[38:40] okay
[38:41] you better listen
[38:43] now if i was one time in your life i'd
[38:45] lay my heavy fields down put them in my
[38:47] seat on my bridges and set at home if
[38:50] brother dale's done anything
[38:53] in the 35 or 40 years that i fasted
[38:55] mostly
[38:59] if i've done anything that you think was
[39:01] wrong against you i'm sorry
[39:03] forgive me
[39:07] i don't want
[39:08] no problems
[39:12] does it matter who's right and wrong
[39:14] your husband's wife have divorces
[39:16] because both of them think they're right
[39:20] the only thing that asks your question
[39:22] is please answer this
[39:24] and i'm standing here shaking because
[39:27] you are the people that pray for me
[39:29] to come through
[39:32] but i'm the person that's got to tell
[39:34] you the truth
[39:35] whether i like it or you like it
[39:39] men are women here tonight
[39:42] if you were standing in this pulpit
[39:44] preaching tonight
[39:46] and i was sitting there in the
[39:47] congregation
[39:49] and looking like most of you do
[39:58] come on if i sit there looking like most
[40:00] of you do
[40:01] when the service is over you'd everyone
[40:04] line up and want to know what's wrong
[40:07] that's all i say
[40:19] sorry that petty feelings got involved
[40:22] forgive me
[40:26] but what would you do if i was sitting
[40:27] there looking like you look while i'm up
[40:29] here
[40:31] you say well it don't matter yes it does
[40:35] i'm
[40:36] sorry
[40:38] i believe that heaven is a real place
[40:40] just the same as this is a real place
[40:43] see for god started us in our spiritual
[40:45] growth in this place
[40:47] i believe that heaven is a place just as
[40:50] real as this
[40:51] where we don't set dire for eternity
[40:55] and just sit there on a cloud
[40:58] we don't just strum our heart
[41:01] for all all from
[41:03] here
[41:04] ever but we're going to a real place
[41:09] where we're going to do things
[41:11] where we're going to live
[41:14] where we're going to work
[41:16] where we're going to enjoy
[41:18] we're going to live we're going to life
[41:21] going to real eternal life we're going
[41:24] to a heaven a paradise
[41:26] just like adam and eve worked and lived
[41:28] and hated and enjoyed in the garden of
[41:31] eden before sin came in we're on our
[41:33] road right back there again right back
[41:37] the first adam through sin taken us out
[41:40] the second atom through righteousness
[41:42] brings us back in again justifies us and
[41:45] brings us back in now here's where did i
[41:47] hurt feelings
[41:48] because you've already got your computer
[41:51] that i've taught you
[41:52] most of it
[41:55] and you're saying brother dale we're not
[41:56] going to heaven
[41:58] we're going to the future home that's
[42:00] coming here
[42:06] i'll remind you
[42:08] that what i just read it
[42:10] right is in 1965
[42:13] the future home was preached in 1964.
[42:18] i wrote it on the side of your notes
[42:20] you might not be able to read that but
[42:22] it means the future home was written in
[42:24] 1964 or preached
[42:30] when it comes down is it going to do it
[42:32] with everything
[42:34] this is an odd way to get to a point
[42:35] that i'm trying to make but it's the
[42:36] best way i know how to do
[42:42] well brother dale what does heaven
[42:43] consist of
[42:46] according to second peter 3 and 7
[42:50] the heavens are kept in store
[42:52] i want
[42:54] the word of god
[42:58] 1 16-17
[43:00] all things that consist
[43:07] they consist by the word
[43:10] remember
[43:13] the future home
[43:15] comes down
[43:17] out of heaven
[43:20] to this earth amen
[43:23] does that annihilate heaven don't
[43:25] annihilate too quick because remember
[43:27] revelations 19
[43:29] 14 through 16
[43:31] says that we ride back with him on white
[43:34] horses out of heaven
[43:39] am i in the bible amen yeah but you're
[43:41] destroying my thoughts oh good amen
[43:44] because i thought
[43:46] that we believe that they're on the
[43:48] river jordan it wasn't all this mix-up
[43:50] situation but it was the god of heaven
[43:53] uniting upon the earth
[43:55] did that do away with heaven
[43:58] right
[44:01] but you see you're gonna have to think
[44:06] you're gonna have to think
[44:08] and keep your mind straight
[44:12] because you're gonna let your computer
[44:13] cut me off
[44:15] and i can't hit that
[44:18] i can't help that part
[44:21] i have to get over it
[44:25] because i realize if you don't see what
[44:26] i'm talking about the next few services
[44:28] some of you will be leaving
[44:34] i pray for that in my heart but you
[44:36] remember
[44:37] you go out of this door ain't nobody
[44:39] ever went out of this door that this man
[44:41] don't steal love
[44:44] i loved everyone and always who loved
[44:46] everyone it hated me and got me wrong
[44:49] i've never had them
[44:51] many that in my mind of hatred against
[44:53] any of them
[44:56] and done everything i could
[44:59] to try to hold together and you've been
[45:01] with me and a lot of it so yes right you

[48:25] and look so it can't be anything outside
[48:26] of the eternal life we've been talking
[48:28] about the cross
[48:29] that's where the choosing was at it's
[48:31] not that he was choosing upsides and
[48:32] deciding who to save and what was to do
[48:35] and it wasn't as even i've tried to
[48:36] bring to you it wasn't that he was
[48:38] looking down to see who had won it right
[48:41] around said what could you do this is
[48:43] hundreds of billions and billions of
[48:45] years ago that's right
[48:47] well it's just in his mind we remember
[48:49] his mind is greater than our mind
[48:53] his mind is his attributes and his
[48:55] thoughts and who he is
[48:58] so keep it in mind that's right
[49:00] well look what you're said
[49:02] which we have a little time now he's
[49:03] covered uh
[49:05] chosen in him wish we had a little time
[49:07] to go
[49:07] to job 37-37
[49:10] which is really 38 4-2-7
[49:13] see where
[49:14] see there were he said
[49:17] where was you when i laid the foundation
[49:19] to the world
[49:20] before i laid the foundation work
[49:22] declaring me where you were they're
[49:24] facing their face and they are where was
[49:27] you when the morning started staying
[49:28] together and the sons of god shouted for
[49:31] joy telling job buckle up yourself like
[49:34] a man i want to speak to you
[49:36] another man said that made job get to
[49:38] the basis that he could see something
[49:41] and said he wanted some way for
[49:44] somebody to come and take
[49:47] god
[49:49] and man
[49:50] and bring them together
[49:53] he said it wasn't long
[49:56] so he said buckle up stand up
[49:59] i know my redeemer liveth amen
[50:03] something happened
[50:05] because of his desires amen
[50:10] because of his desires
[50:12] all right
[50:14] but just remember that when we were
[50:15] chosen in christ
[50:18] so it's not accused not ball team to
[50:20] reject one and accept the other
[50:23] there was no choosing in the basis of
[50:25] who to choose in this he chose to come
[50:29] this way to bring his family into being
[50:33] i can't have it
[50:35] if he gave me a part of his life to make
[50:37] this family i can't help being a dale
[50:41] i didn't have anything to do with it
[50:44] you didn't have nothing to do with yours
[50:47] sure we accepted jesus christ as our
[50:49] savior
[50:50] sure he was looking at that through
[50:52] predestination four knowledges and we'll
[50:54] cover all of that later for when we get
[50:56] down to earth but we're still in heaven
[50:59] we've got to bring that heaven and earth
[51:01] into a being to where we can see what's
[51:02] going on right
[51:04] and that's what we're trying our best to
[51:06] live background tonight to get to to get
[51:08] the point
[51:11] all right
[51:13] why we are not a denomination
[51:15] preached in 1958 927 paragraph 241
[51:20] and then before there was respect of
[51:22] life on this earth
[51:24] our bodies were laying here
[51:27] hallelujah
[51:28] before one drop of moisture was ever
[51:31] moisture ever come on the earth
[51:33] we were laying here
[51:35] when adam walked up and down in the
[51:36] garden of eden i was laying here amen
[51:40] yes sir now he's talking about your body
[51:43] oh glory
[51:45] when the cherubims the morning stars
[51:48] sang together and the sons of god
[51:50] shouted for joy i was laying here just
[51:53] waiting for the breath of life to come
[51:56] i was here he made me here had my body
[51:59] laying here
[52:00] yes sir it isn't where you come from my
[52:03] how did it get
[52:05] it
[52:06] excuse me
[52:08] it wasn't where you come from my
[52:10] how did it get done god laid had it
[52:13] laying here god made it and we're made
[52:16] out of the seven sixteen elements for
[52:18] trolling possession and said we were
[52:20] laying here
[52:22] that's right now
[52:24] he's talking about him
[52:26] we got a few scriptures that's
[52:27] supposedly into a lot of people but we
[52:30] won't get to him until sunday
[52:33] and a quote from brother brown
[52:36] that is confusing
[52:38] to a lot
[52:42] remember what i said the other day
[52:45] he asked job where was he
[52:47] joe couldn't comprehend
[52:49] but we better be able by now to begin to
[52:51] comprehend
[52:53] where we were
[52:54] and what was going on before the
[52:56] foundation of the world
[52:58] not as people yeah i read you the quote
[53:01] not our being here
[53:03] but has that eternal life of christ
[53:06] as a part of our father to be his
[53:08] offspring his children
[53:11] mighty arrest you to find out that
[53:13] brother branham said the seed on this
[53:15] earth
[53:16] was here from another civilization
[53:21] there is a doctrine among mankind that
[53:24] says that they that he was
[53:26] people before adam and eve
[53:29] a world
[53:30] a people before adam and eve people were
[53:33] created it just records adam and eve
[53:35] being created
[53:38] i don't agree with it
[53:42] but i do know where those seed come from
[53:44] that's right
[53:47] white had to be shepherds 1964 12 20 or
[53:50] 12 22.
[53:54] the first time angels ever sang in a
[53:56] celebration
[53:58] it was in heaven
[54:00] now we got nothing down here where he
[54:02] sang i said the same one
[54:03] where he sang on earth when the baby was
[54:05] born
[54:06] but you better listen
[54:08] now this sort of answer who the
[54:10] cherubian you know the uh angels
[54:14] morning stars sang together
[54:17] angels
[54:20] and the sons of god shouted for joy
[54:24] all right
[54:24] angels singing
[54:26] angels were created way before right
[54:29] come on
[54:31] the first time angel was ever saying the
[54:32] celebration it was in heaven if you look
[54:34] in job
[54:36] 8 38-7
[54:37] as i see something you taking notes when
[54:39] god first planned on making his first
[54:42] creation the earth job was a great smart
[54:44] man and he had all kind of wisdom he
[54:46] said when i go up to the markets the
[54:48] young princes they all bow down before
[54:50] me and just one moment of my wisdom he
[54:54] couldn't figure out why he had to be
[54:56] treated the way he was
[54:58] listen
[54:59] so god asked him
[55:01] gird yourself up like a man because i'm
[55:04] coming down to talk to you
[55:07] and when you remember he said he that
[55:08] counts with wisdom and things over here
[55:10] we read the first verse or two
[55:12] and when god came down in a whirlwind he
[55:15] said job where was you before i laid the
[55:17] foundation of the earth when the morning
[55:20] stars sang together and the sons of god
[55:21] shouted for joy where were you then job
[55:24] and he was deflated at that time
[55:27] where was you means you didn't
[55:29] understand right right
[55:30] see the first time angels ever sang in
[55:32] the celebration was in heaven
[55:35] but the first time that they ever sang
[55:37] on earth was the shepherds at the birth
[55:39] of god emmanuel on earth the first human
[55:42] beings ever heard an angel sing
[55:44] was humble shepherds an angel singing
[55:48] morning stars saying together don't go
[55:50] away
[55:51] i know what morning stars means also
[55:54] it means the children of god
[55:57] but it means angels
[55:59] so why would you be dealing with morning
[56:01] stars why would god bring up morning
[56:03] stars
[56:05] as people
[56:06] right
[56:07] and sons of god as people right
[56:10] you get me
[56:12] he's covered they're angels
[56:14] angels are created first
[56:20] serpent seed
[56:22] 58 928 evening service paragraph 82.
[56:26] i want to ask you this job 27 38
[56:30] when he said where was you when i led to
[56:32] foundation of earth when the morning
[56:34] started saying together and the sons of
[56:35] god standing for joy who were those who
[56:38] were those sons of god that were
[56:40] shouting for joy
[56:42] now he tells you who they were
[56:44] jesus told them
[56:48] now who are who were the sons of gods
[56:51] that were morning stars signed together
[56:53] and the sons of god shouted for joy who
[56:55] were those sons of god that was shouting
[56:57] for joy jesus told them that i had joy
[57:00] with you before the foundation of the
[57:02] world
[57:03] we're not creatures of time we're
[57:05] creatures of eternity no man can come to
[57:07] me except my father draws him and all
[57:09] that comes to me i'll give them eternal
[57:12] life and raise him up at the last day no
[57:14] man can pluck him out of my hand he said
[57:16] why you're afraid
[57:19] why are we afraid
[57:22] this thing was over you don't find out
[57:23] in a minute when we get through readings
[57:25] huh this thing was over before the world
[57:26] ever begun that's why they told me the
[57:28] first come into the message they said
[57:29] you can't get saved because redemption
[57:32] was over in 63.
[57:34] say oh everybody teaches that i said i'm
[57:37] sorry i just realized i'm not born again
[57:41] well i'm too late i'm sorry buddy you
[57:44] know
[57:46] but when it come around to 69 and god
[57:48] gave me the baptism of the holy ghost
[57:51] i said you come and kill me now that i'm
[57:53] not safe
[57:55] come on
[57:57] you might argue my mentality but you
[57:59] will not argue with god's word
[58:02] you see
[58:03] oh
[58:05] this was over before the world ever
[58:06] begun because that's what i told them
[58:07] then i said look according to bible
[58:09] salvation was over before the world ever
[58:10] begun i read the bible before i come
[58:13] into the message
[58:15] that's what i study that's why i don't
[58:16] read it now as much as i need to i read
[58:18] what wrote around says about it compare
[58:20] it and go back because my memory is
[58:22] still decent about what i read when i
[58:24] was in the baptist church and i read
[58:26] then that
[58:28] these verses was ringing in my mind
[58:33] i tell the baptist i told the preacher i
[58:35] said listen the bible don't say he that
[58:39] believe
[58:40] if you believe
[58:41] he said he that believeth and is
[58:43] baptized shall be saved
[58:45] right
[58:47] they didn't like it they don't like it
[58:49] now but i'm sorry
[58:51] it's something inside of me it's not me
[58:54] i love you
[58:56] but i'll still have to tell my wife my
[58:58] kids my grandkids my great-grandkids i
[59:00] gotta tell you the truth
[59:03] we're not going out of here on a sugar
[59:04] tip thing over a change we're going his
[59:07] way we're saying by the grave
[59:10] that's right
[59:11] that's the choice we've got
[59:13] if i go
[59:14] it means i didn't make the place but i
[59:17] will argue over some quotes with you if
[59:18] you want to
[59:20] don't argue too much
[59:24] don't jump up with your computer too
[59:25] much
[59:27] because you're going to tell me that
[59:28] brother branham didn't have rapture in
[59:30] faith
[59:32] now he never reached a change but he
[59:34] sure spoke of it
[59:36] you tell me paul
[59:38] he just never reached it
[59:40] it was not time
[59:42] did jesus have rapture in faith why do
[59:46] you have to die
[59:49] see just don't don't come to me
[59:52] i'm sorry it's just i'm just making this
[59:54] away
[59:55] and if it's your benefit praise god for
[59:57] it but ain't forget it go somewhere else
[59:59] and help somebody else
[1:00:01] and i appreciate everything anybody has
[1:00:03] ever done around here
[1:00:06] witnesses preaching 1953 403 the evening
[1:00:09] service prayer at 140.
[1:00:13] someone said the other day said
[1:00:15] brother billy
[1:00:16] are you still preaching some kind of
[1:00:19] some of that new kind of religion you
[1:00:22] got
[1:00:23] that's what i told you everybody thinks
[1:00:24] we got a new kind of religion
[1:00:27] right
[1:00:29] everybody says that's a new religion
[1:00:32] look what he says let him answer it
[1:00:35] i said no sir i'm preaching the oldest
[1:00:37] religion there ever was and the only one
[1:00:41] there really is and got salvation in it
[1:00:46] they were deflated
[1:00:48] some of that new kind said
[1:00:52] we didn't have that here a few years ago
[1:00:55] you know that's what people say
[1:00:57] i said let me tell you brother
[1:00:59] it's older than the world is
[1:01:02] that's right job said where were you
[1:01:04] when i laid the foundation of the world
[1:01:05] when the morning started saying together
[1:01:07] and the sons of god shouted for joy
[1:01:09] millions of years before the foundation
[1:01:11] of the world amen we so listen to the
[1:01:13] rest of them
[1:01:15] why we're not a denomination 1958 927
[1:01:18] paragraph 283
[1:01:19] in god's book he's done said he'll meet
[1:01:23] me right you right there
[1:01:25] there ain't all devils out of hell can
[1:01:27] keep me ever
[1:01:29] keep him any worry
[1:01:31] they will out of hell can ever keep him
[1:01:34] anywhere else but keep him from coming
[1:01:37] right there see that's it'll keep them
[1:01:39] from coming
[1:01:41] he'll keep you from coming for a while
[1:01:42] but that'll stop you
[1:01:45] and they don't stop you no
[1:01:47] because god had already said
[1:01:49] so and that settles it it's a hundred
[1:01:52] billion years before the world was ever
[1:01:54] formed the morning stars sang together
[1:01:56] and the sons of god shouted for joy
[1:01:58] before there was a foundation in the
[1:01:59] world they see four before before there
[1:02:02] was a foundation and them angels and
[1:02:05] everything was happy shouting about it
[1:02:07] before there was a foundation of the
[1:02:08] world how's the devil ever going to keep
[1:02:11] me in the dust of the earth he can't do
[1:02:14] it
[1:02:15] you're right
[1:02:18] spiritual amnesia 1964
[1:02:21] 411 1964 paragraph 88 89 and 90.
[1:02:26] to be a christian you have to be the
[1:02:27] same
[1:02:29] we don't want to forget that all that he
[1:02:33] was i'm identified with him i'm
[1:02:35] identified with him
[1:02:37] notice and he is in me and i in him
[1:02:40] notice that every christian that's a
[1:02:42] real genuine christian
[1:02:45] christian was with him
[1:02:47] when the morning started saying together
[1:02:49] the sons of god shouted for joy before
[1:02:50] there was a foundation of the world we
[1:02:52] were identified in the immortal realms
[1:02:55] with god
[1:02:57] now listen
[1:02:58] 10 million years before the world was
[1:03:01] ever formed
[1:03:02] i was back there with him
[1:03:04] if i got eternal life
[1:03:06] i was there with there with him i was
[1:03:10] identified with him when the morning
[1:03:11] starts singing together and the sons of
[1:03:12] god shouted for joy
[1:03:14] i was with him when he called abraham
[1:03:16] see everybody loves to come down to
[1:03:17] earth you know i was with him when he
[1:03:18] was abraham i'd wait a minute david i
[1:03:20] was with him now listen
[1:03:22] he just said was with him back there in
[1:03:23] the same phrase i was with him when he
[1:03:25] called abraham at the age of 75 years
[1:03:27] old and his wife being
[1:03:29] and told him they were going to have
[1:03:32] a baby i was with him when he took his
[1:03:35] stand on thus saith the lord i'm going
[1:03:38] to have the baby i stood with him
[1:03:40] every other christian stood with him i
[1:03:42] was with him when he
[1:03:44] with his i was with him
[1:03:47] with him when his temptations come
[1:03:49] i was with him when he went up on the
[1:03:52] top of the mountain to offer up isaac i
[1:03:55] was with him
[1:03:57] when the realm appeared
[1:04:06] with
[1:04:08] doesn't seem a strange word anymore
[1:04:10] right
[1:04:11] can't just eat it right or something's
[1:04:13] messed up that's right
[1:04:16] but you know brother brandon when he
[1:04:17] gave the emphasis to get over to the
[1:04:18] bride of christ he wouldn't use the word
[1:04:20] emphasis uh with
[1:04:22] he'd say in right
[1:04:26] i was in him in a shorter gallon
[1:04:28] i was with him when he went to
[1:04:29] california i was with him when he
[1:04:31] resurrected
[1:04:34] no i was in
[1:04:35] right now
[1:04:38] i was in
[1:04:41] i could be with abraham let's get a
[1:04:43] little bit differently don't worry
[1:04:53] questions and answers on genesis 53 7 29
[1:04:56] paragraph 61.
[1:04:59] now the first man now he made the first
[1:05:01] man in his image
[1:05:02] and we're returning back to that image
[1:05:05] that's right
[1:05:06] to our first
[1:05:07] created image
[1:05:15] remember now
[1:05:17] you say create it
[1:05:18] mean it had a beginning
[1:05:23] not if it's part of him
[1:05:26] jesus was the beginning of the creation
[1:05:27] of god which meant what
[1:05:30] he was almighty god
[1:05:34] brother branham said
[1:05:35] god was his first creation
[1:05:40] am i in the prophet's message
[1:05:44] see our computer's click that we can
[1:05:46] make it say what we want to
[1:05:49] would bring it with the rest of the word
[1:05:52] so when god created me william branham
[1:05:56] i was before the foundation of the world
[1:06:01] he made my being
[1:06:03] my spirit
[1:06:04] i wasn't conscious of anything as far as
[1:06:07] i know of
[1:06:08] but the i was there
[1:06:11] oh i don't don't believe you're getting
[1:06:13] it
[1:06:14] but now just a minute jesus told the
[1:06:17] disciples that he knew them before the
[1:06:19] foundation of the world and paul
[1:06:22] said here that he chose us in him before
[1:06:25] the foundation of the world
[1:06:27] now there was some part of me armand
[1:06:30] neville and the rest of you all here
[1:06:32] that's in christ
[1:06:34] jesus before the foundation
[1:06:37] ever be before the world ever begin
[1:06:40] and here's my analysis of what that was
[1:06:42] now you go study that if you want to and
[1:06:44] you'll find that he goes into the
[1:06:45] creation of angels and shows that
[1:06:48] one-third of the angels
[1:06:50] fail
[1:06:52] and they give us the nature
[1:06:55] but the other two-third of the angels
[1:06:56] which most of the time run around will
[1:06:58] quote two-thirds for some reason he'll
[1:06:59] quote two-thirds of the angels fail
[1:07:01] when the bible says one-third of the
[1:07:03] anger will fail i'm not correcting him
[1:07:04] any corrections don't say if he says it
[1:07:08] but what does it make any difference see
[1:07:09] what we argue with it what is it
[1:07:10] two-thirds one there what
[1:07:12] which one do you think i think
[1:07:13] two-thirds i'm going my way you go your
[1:07:14] way
[1:07:16] i'm getting that stupidity right
[1:07:21] he said i wasn't conscious of anything
[1:07:23] as far as i know of
[1:07:24] but i was there i don't believe you're
[1:07:26] getting it but now
[1:07:29] just a minute jesus told the disciples
[1:07:31] that he knew them before the
[1:07:32] foundational world and paul said here
[1:07:34] that he chose this in him before the
[1:07:36] foundation to work
[1:07:37] now there was some part of me armand
[1:07:41] the rest of you all here that's in
[1:07:44] christ jesus before the world ever begun
[1:07:48] all right
[1:07:50] now back to his point and you ought to
[1:07:52] run this in and listen to what he says a
[1:07:54] lot of times
[1:07:55] and you'll find out brother branham was
[1:07:57] a pretty good human being
[1:08:00] i don't mean this wrong but it's not in
[1:08:02] the one i'm using but
[1:08:04] yeah i get to admit
[1:08:06] but around a good human being
[1:08:09] we think he's so immortal
[1:08:15] what about where he was letting a little
[1:08:16] nurse just rub his back
[1:08:18] and all he was in was for some tests
[1:08:22] and if my wife comes to the hospital
[1:08:24] room that some of you thought i guess i
[1:08:25] was there the other night and i'm sorry
[1:08:27] we didn't leave that get out because
[1:08:29] that was the time god was doing his work
[1:08:31] but
[1:08:33] the little nurse is rubbing brother
[1:08:35] brown's back
[1:08:36] my wife come into this she said let's
[1:08:38] not take care of that myself
[1:08:42] i mean i trust her that much
[1:08:46] but we find out we're all human
[1:08:49] what kind of a new religion brother
[1:08:51] branham what kind of a new religion do
[1:08:53] you have in this message people
[1:08:55] what kind of new religion have you got

[1:09:05] prophet coming we've never heard of

[1:09:11] of these doctrines you have of
[1:09:13] predestinations and and marriage and
[1:09:15] divorce and and all these things we're
[1:09:18] just sweet little humble people that

[1:10:12] where you messed up

[1:10:19] it's either god or not god
[1:10:21] right
[1:10:22] so ain't no lulla thing
[1:10:25] but that's the way people think
[1:10:28] suburban church age 1960 1246
[1:10:32] paragraph 58
[1:10:34] look little did israel know when they
[1:10:36] were standing out there on the bank
[1:10:38] shoddy
[1:10:39] you say
[1:10:40] this kind of religion is something new
[1:10:43] why it's the oldest there is
[1:10:45] sure even before the world was ever made
[1:10:49] they were shouting and praising god god
[1:10:51] said so ask job where was you when when
[1:10:54] the morning stars sang together and the
[1:10:56] sons of god shouted for joy that's
[1:10:57] before the world was ever created
[1:11:03] i will restore 1953
[1:11:05] 1110 paragraph
[1:11:07] 38.
[1:11:11] and any man knows that the angel of the
[1:11:13] covenant with jesus christ that's right
[1:11:15] that's saying yesterday and forever god
[1:11:17] unfolded himself down that was god in
[1:11:19] that pillar of fire he unfolded himself
[1:11:21] down into a human body virgin born no
[1:11:24] man can touch him there
[1:11:26] you could see him here but he's a virgin
[1:11:29] born right
[1:11:34] now he went away a little while in the
[1:11:35] world shift me no more yet i'll be with
[1:11:37] you even in you
[1:11:39] same god living right down unfolding
[1:11:42] himself into the heart of man got down
[1:11:44] here where he could shape him and give
[1:11:46] them
[1:11:47] a rejoicing like job did
[1:11:50] they said brother branham that's the new
[1:11:52] kind of that's that new kind of religion
[1:11:55] huh
[1:11:56] it's just a new case of the old time
[1:11:59] all time why
[1:12:01] god asked job where was you when i laid
[1:12:04] the foundation of the world when the
[1:12:05] morning started saying together the sons
[1:12:07] of god shouted for joy before the
[1:12:09] foundation of the world
[1:12:10] ever was ever
[1:12:12] this ain't something new is something
[1:12:14] old
[1:12:15] it's the beginning
[1:12:17] you remember the background phrases of
[1:12:19] most of what i'm reading to you is what
[1:12:22] about the the first time he run into the
[1:12:24] like jesus name people or something to
[1:12:26] the one that's formed with people and as
[1:12:29] he was and the man got up to preach you
[1:12:31] know how he come down the horizontal
[1:12:33] rainbow and all like that he said
[1:12:35] man i wish i had what he had
[1:12:38] all right but look white had to be
[1:12:39] shepard 64 12 21 paragraph 92 let's see
[1:12:44] wait a minute
[1:12:45] i've read that okay
[1:12:47] x that one now
[1:12:50] oh i flipped pages excuse me that's what
[1:12:52] i've done the other day when i was
[1:12:53] reading one it just slid down i just
[1:12:55] read them right off the next one
[1:12:58] let's get this and we'll get through
[1:13:00] maybe we'll hey we're going to make it
[1:13:02] we can say
[1:13:07] all right we ended on the 14th
[1:13:10] all right this is the one where brother
[1:13:11] branham the rejected king 1965 15 the
[1:13:15] morning service and brother branham is
[1:13:16] in the hospital he's getting ready for
[1:13:18] some tests for going overseas and he
[1:13:20] he's um
[1:13:23] this nurse is coming in and she said you
[1:13:25] know and said may i rub your back and
[1:13:27] make you feel a little better with the
[1:13:29] alcohol he said
[1:13:30] and i see it you may do it
[1:13:33] and while she was rubbing my on my back
[1:13:35] she said what denomination of church do
[1:13:38] you belong to
[1:13:40] and i said oh i belong to the oldest
[1:13:41] denomination that there is
[1:13:43] she said what denomination is that i
[1:13:46] said it's the one that was organized
[1:13:48] before the world was ever organized
[1:13:52] oh she said
[1:13:54] what i don't believe
[1:13:56] i just know just that she said i belong
[1:13:59] to a certain church is it that
[1:14:00] organization
[1:14:03] and i said no ma'am
[1:14:05] that was only about 200 years ago that
[1:14:08] organization but this organization
[1:14:10] started when the morning stars staying
[1:14:11] together the sons of god shouted for joy
[1:14:15] when they seen
[1:14:16] the coming of a savior
[1:14:19] to redeem mankind
[1:14:22] what made those angels sing
[1:14:26] even though they were not lost
[1:14:32] they were rejoicing about what was going
[1:14:34] to happen
[1:14:37] who was it and where was it or what
[1:14:39] could it be in what form could it exist
[1:14:42] that we could shout
[1:14:44] back there
[1:14:50] are you thinking
[1:14:53] why is it why did the prophet emphasize
[1:14:55] that
[1:14:58] it seemed the coming redeemed
[1:15:03] this is an eternity pact let me quote
[1:15:06] around in the beginning before the
[1:15:08] eternal that's the best quote i like
[1:15:10] about right here
[1:15:11] when you say in the beginning before the
[1:15:14] eternal
[1:15:15] now when we say eternal that's as far as
[1:15:18] our mind can comprehend
[1:15:21] but brother brown went back into the
[1:15:23] mind of god and brought out the things
[1:15:26] of god
[1:15:28] that he saw before the world ever begun
[1:15:33] where was you
[1:15:37] when this was taking place
[1:15:43] if you wasn't back there shouting
[1:15:47] maybe that's the reason a lot of people
[1:15:49] don't shout down here
[1:15:52] maybe that's why this message has become
[1:15:54] a bunch of sad
[1:15:57] sick-hearted people
[1:16:00] and even physically sick
[1:16:04] maybe it's because we don't realize who
[1:16:06] we are
[1:16:09] but you know brother i got it right
[1:16:10] across here but brother dale you sound
[1:16:13] just like you talking about like brother
[1:16:15] so-and-so because he said we would ever
[1:16:17] want up there in heaven i don't know
[1:16:20] what he's talking about right
[1:16:22] i ain't concerned about what he's
[1:16:23] talking about i ain't concerned where he
[1:16:25] was telling the truth or not
[1:16:27] because i told a lot of them and asked
[1:16:28] them simple little questions and found
[1:16:30] out they wasn't they talking about this
[1:16:32] guy you're looking at this guy you
[1:16:34] looking at was now that first chapter he
[1:16:36] shout now
[1:16:41] jesus christ that walked a short galilee
[1:16:45] i'm on a tree before this world ever
[1:16:48] begun
[1:16:49] but he didn't hang on it until 2000
[1:16:51] years ago
[1:16:54] but in god's mind it was already done
[1:16:56] and finished
[1:16:58] right
[1:16:59] oh
[1:17:01] well there's been something
[1:17:03] we're just mortals and we can't
[1:17:04] comprehend
[1:17:08] but wouldn't it be something
[1:17:11] that if you could have set back his way
[1:17:12] he was talking wednesday night
[1:17:14] on want to kick him because he's getting
[1:17:17] too close
[1:17:18] to what i wanted to bring out
[1:17:22] but wouldn't this be an entirely
[1:17:23] different world
[1:17:27] if we come down and he was using dick
[1:17:28] and gale so i used that
[1:17:31] three kids
[1:17:33] wouldn't have been something brother
[1:17:34] dick if you'd have knowed
[1:17:37] first thing knowledge you got
[1:17:41] whatever year would be you know two or
[1:17:43] three whatever you
[1:17:45] there's knowledge you got
[1:17:48] one day i'm gonna have three kids
[1:17:52] they're inside of me
[1:17:55] and i'm gonna have three kids
[1:17:58] i'm gonna name
[1:17:59] connie
[1:18:00] and ginger and brad
[1:18:09] and then he finds a beautiful little
[1:18:11] girl running around
[1:18:14] he begins to talk a little about
[1:18:17] wedding
[1:18:21] and he says gail when we get married
[1:18:24] we're gonna have three kids
[1:18:29] still
[1:18:30] there's gonna be
[1:18:32] two girls and one boy
[1:18:35] gonna be the boys brad two girls she
[1:18:37] injured connie
[1:18:42] she knows that
[1:18:45] they're gonna have three kids
[1:18:52] and then she went into the doctors and
[1:18:54] the doctors told her physically you know
[1:18:55] what
[1:18:57] this
[1:19:00] i'm sorry but you can't have any
[1:19:01] children
[1:19:06] if you go home you know what she'd say
[1:19:09] he said dick
[1:19:12] you're gonna have to marry somebody else
[1:19:14] who's gonna have three kids
[1:19:16] because i've just been told the news
[1:19:17] that i can't have no children
[1:19:24] brother dick would be the head of the
[1:19:26] house the man the things like adam in
[1:19:28] the garden and eve you get the picture
[1:19:31] tying it all up
[1:19:33] and he'd go back and he'd say okay
[1:19:37] i read about abraham
[1:19:39] amen
[1:19:41] he said
[1:19:43] he's 100 years old
[1:19:46] when he got a child
[1:19:49] i said sarah was 90.
[1:19:52] so somewhere between
[1:19:55] here and there we're going to have three
[1:19:57] kids
[1:19:58] and said let me tell you the rest of the
[1:20:00] story he said
[1:20:01] sarah passed off and said abraham had
[1:20:03] about seven more kids
[1:20:06] we said all you gonna get because we
[1:20:07] know what abraham and sarah didn't have
[1:20:09] a warrant
[1:20:11] that was it he didn't have no more
[1:20:13] promises that's right it didn't matter
[1:20:15] if they went back young he could happen
[1:20:16] by others he couldn't have him
[1:20:18] underwater no more by sarah because that
[1:20:20] was it yeah man all right
[1:20:22] see it this isn't god's promise
[1:20:24] get the point of what i'm talking about
[1:20:28] so when brother dick is a little over
[1:20:29] here running around in school this
[1:20:32] little boy was cussing and fighting he
[1:20:34] said let me tell you
[1:20:36] i'm going down through here again
[1:20:38] let me tell you
[1:20:39] we're going to have
[1:20:41] we have three kids
[1:20:43] their names are connie ginger and brad
[1:20:49] well now three kids
[1:20:51] what do you think he's gonna be thought
[1:20:52] of
[1:20:54] if you really believed it would it
[1:20:56] hinder you
[1:20:58] you know are you sweet
[1:21:00] they wouldn't hinder you are you not
[1:21:02] asleep which one it wouldn't hinder you
[1:21:04] would
[1:21:05] all right
[1:21:06] see that's right
[1:21:08] all right
[1:21:09] i'm trying to get a point to you where
[1:21:11] you believe it or not
[1:21:21] he was rejoicing
[1:21:24] because his family was coming and every
[1:21:27] member of his body would vibrate
[1:21:30] shake it
[1:21:32] just
[1:21:33] trembling
[1:21:35] because he knew
[1:21:38] the plan of redemption would come
[1:21:50] remember what i said the other day we'll
[1:21:51] get to it one of these days
[1:21:56] god created
[1:21:59] that form that was even back there that
[1:22:01] we called the word
[1:22:03] god in other forms
[1:22:05] he was a father
[1:22:08] but that was not what he wanted
[1:22:11] he created adam that made him a father
[1:22:14] but not what he wanted
[1:22:16] that's right
[1:22:18] did you just see all with inside of that
[1:22:20] word form
[1:22:22] the rejoicing of each one of those
[1:22:25] that would realize realization that one
[1:22:27] day
[1:22:31] you see now you're getting it too close
[1:22:33] i'm not got it close enough yet that's
[1:22:35] right
[1:22:36] those inside of him would be saying one
[1:22:38] day we're going
[1:22:41] amen not something to volunteer not
[1:22:43] daddy send us on there let's not just
[1:22:45] die no no no no go to that mankind
[1:22:48] they try to make trinity some thoughts
[1:22:50] out of it
[1:22:51] they say jesus stepped over and said
[1:22:53] i'll go
[1:22:54] no he came himself
[1:22:58] that's right
[1:23:00] there's rejoicing going on
[1:23:03] those angels that love deep
[1:23:06] they look at him
[1:23:09] and they see in his mind and open it
[1:23:12] and they see him so
[1:23:14] in a
[1:23:16] real that they've never seen him before
[1:23:20] right
[1:23:21] i say
[1:23:23] what's going on
[1:23:26] he said i was just thinking about my
[1:23:27] family yeah any man
[1:23:29] that's right yes sir
[1:23:31] just thinking about my family
[1:23:38] when they've seen the coming of a savior
[1:23:41] to redeem mankind
[1:23:45] i'll remind you something
[1:23:49] at this time of what we're talking about
[1:23:51] i tried to make it
[1:23:53] god stepped over into another form
[1:23:56] to create
[1:23:59] he had already created angels
[1:24:05] because they were first
[1:24:15] and at that time the angels had fallen
[1:24:20] the one-third of the angels
[1:24:23] had fallen
[1:24:27] gone to a place
[1:24:31] that will get to sunday
[1:24:34] go to a place
[1:24:37] to do their haddock
[1:24:40] yep that's right
[1:24:43] can't you see it
[1:24:50] adoption 2 1965-18
[1:24:53] prayer f151
[1:24:55] so beautifully displayed in the prodigal
[1:24:57] son i was lost this is my son
[1:25:00] he was lost
[1:25:03] and now he's found
[1:25:05] he was dead and he's alive again bring
[1:25:07] forth the fatted calf the best roll of a
[1:25:09] ring and put it on his finger
[1:25:11] unless no matter where the morning
[1:25:13] starts
[1:25:14] no wonder when the morning stars sang
[1:25:17] together and the sons of god shouted for
[1:25:19] joy
[1:25:20] when they sing the plan of salvation
[1:25:23] god put in your name on the book
[1:25:27] before the foundation of the world
[1:25:42] you started writing yep
[1:25:46] there's not anything in the lounge book
[1:25:48] of life sex and eternal now we're
[1:25:49] talking
[1:25:51] but names
[1:25:54] and it is not your earthly name james
[1:25:57] right
[1:26:00] we'll get to that
[1:26:02] little random said
[1:26:04] it was your name
[1:26:07] before the foundational world that's
[1:26:08] right amen before the fall
[1:26:14] so we started writing down names
[1:26:17] and this is nice oh glory
[1:26:20] oh inside of him all the names
[1:26:25] oh fact let's get it
[1:26:28] inside of him all of them that knew
[1:26:30] their name
[1:26:32] they begin to rejoice
[1:26:36] he's probably running all over heaven
[1:26:39] amen you're trying to do away with it
[1:26:44] is what i see the people that manchester
[1:26:51] trying to do away with all these things
[1:26:53] oh heavens down here
[1:26:56] hell's up here
[1:26:58] come on folks
[1:27:00] as he wrote their names

[1:27:05] saw his name
[1:27:09] in the book amen
[1:27:12] you believe amen
[1:27:15] that's why he was shouting
[1:27:17] he didn't see john
[1:27:20] run around what is it he said not herman
[1:27:22] neville
[1:27:24] he said it's what takes place on the
[1:27:25] earth
[1:27:26] see because you've got a book of life
[1:27:29] and the lounge book of life sticks
[1:27:30] section

[1:29:08] singing when they sing the plan of
[1:29:11] redemption god putting your name
[1:29:13] on the book before the foundation of the
[1:29:15] world
[1:29:18] serpent seed 1958 9 2018 in service
[1:29:20] paragraph 1 dear god the great and
[1:29:23] mighty god informed all things by the
[1:29:25] power of his spirit
[1:29:27] and has brought jesus christ his only
[1:29:28] begotten son who freely died for we
[1:29:31] sinners
[1:29:32] we just the judge for the unjust to
[1:29:34] reconcile us back into the marvelous
[1:29:36] fellowship that we have
[1:29:39] again with god and as we thought on the
[1:29:41] blessed word that we had fellowship with
[1:29:43] him before the foundation world when the
[1:29:45] morning stars sang together and the sons
[1:29:47] of god shouted for joy way back before
[1:29:49] the foundation of the world how do we
[1:29:51] know that that wasn't at the same time
[1:29:54] that the lamb was slain
[1:29:57] that when god in his great thinking seen
[1:30:00] us shouting
[1:30:01] and rejoicing in our salvation
[1:30:07] that's right
[1:30:08] he wrote her name down
[1:30:11] i get it that's why i put him in order
[1:30:14] he wrote her name down
[1:30:17] and then one came to die
[1:30:21] there was a lot of rejoicing going on
[1:30:24] you said brother dale that looked like a
[1:30:26] lot of people around up in the nerves
[1:30:29] nope
[1:30:30] still just got one form and that's the
[1:30:32] word
[1:30:34] brother brown said
[1:30:36] if you wasn't in that word form you will
[1:30:38] never be there
[1:30:40] amen
[1:30:42] you said brother dale i've heard you
[1:30:43] preach this many times you have but you
[1:30:46] never heard it
[1:30:47] like you heard it tonight
[1:30:52] but the grey's got the tapes he can
[1:30:53] bring the flame to he's going to because
[1:30:55] i've never seen it
[1:30:58] you say we've we know all about the
[1:31:00] seals the message the bible the the
[1:31:03] godhead the the marriage and divorce we
[1:31:05] know all of these things
[1:31:07] we are just touching the iceberg of what
[1:31:09] the prophet taught us while he was here
[1:31:11] called did i bring anything to not
[1:31:13] contrary to what he said if it did come
[1:31:16] and tell me right now
[1:31:22] no
[1:31:24] this is not a new kind of religion
[1:31:27] this is the oldest religion there ever
[1:31:29] was amen
[1:31:31] amen when the morning stars signed it
[1:31:34] together and the sons of god shouted for
[1:31:36] joy
[1:31:36] why would it say that if they wouldn't
[1:31:38] somebody a first shot
[1:31:40] why would it say as it did it was rain
[1:31:43] written if it wasn't something written
[1:31:45] why would it say the lamb stood as a
[1:31:46] slain before the foundational world if
[1:31:48] it didn't happen
[1:31:53] you'd write it that it all took place
[1:31:55] here
[1:31:58] we know it's got to take place here
[1:32:02] i'm shouting my religion
[1:32:04] and it's the oldest there is in the
[1:32:06] world
[1:32:09] i found out who my daddy is too

[1:32:37] that brother branham was down on his
[1:32:38] knees praying
[1:32:42] the man that taught us all of this about

[1:35:06] she likes to shorten things
[1:35:09] she don't want to play around with them
[1:35:11] words
[1:35:12] and she would say pop
[1:35:15] well we hadn't got figured out it yes
[1:35:16] what deanna's got into but
[1:35:19] see
[1:35:20] she's popped so far so but she'll
[1:35:22] probably move in and say something else
[1:35:24] one day when she does within
[1:35:26] a little aced he'd come along he may
[1:35:28] find something else if you understand
[1:35:30] what i'm getting at
[1:35:32] it's what you are two people personally
[1:35:35] you know grandmother granddaddy
[1:35:37] great-grandmother you've been ready
[1:35:40] husband wife children
[1:35:42] we all know those little petty things
[1:35:46] so
[1:35:47] where's where's debbie
[1:35:50] hey
[1:35:53] how many pumpkins does poppy have
[1:35:57] he's got two pumpkins all right deanna's
[1:36:00] sitting over on the other side deanna
[1:36:01] she's saying it too i hope he's got two
[1:36:03] pumpkins
[1:36:05] but tomorrow how many little puppy house
[1:36:21] so it's just one thing
[1:36:24] one big happy family
[1:36:28] one big happy thing
[1:36:32] because we all can run the dna back and
[1:36:35] find about
[1:36:36] see who belongs to who
[1:36:40] because god's dna runs back to his
[1:36:42] children
[1:36:45] that's why i thank god for luther and
[1:36:47] what it was
[1:36:49] he might not understood a lot but and i
[1:36:51] was just saying maybe i didn't finish
[1:36:53] what
[1:36:54] the whole point while ago but
[1:36:57] luther couldn't say anything about the
[1:36:58] rapture hardly
[1:37:01] at one time
[1:37:02] wesley didn't talk about rapture but all
[1:37:04] of it was living in life and being
[1:37:06] christians
[1:37:07] azusa street more jumping up and
[1:37:09] rejoicing but still falling right back
[1:37:11] down and you know and
[1:37:14] doing
[1:37:16] but in the astronauts
[1:37:18] it's going through space
[1:37:22] in the thought of a mind
[1:37:25] i like to read thanks
[1:37:29] sounds crazy to you but
[1:37:32] always makes me think of something
[1:37:38] i always wondered about dreams
[1:37:40] i finished the message of
[1:37:42] just talking here quoted 25 to 9.
[1:37:48] i've always wondered about dreams
[1:37:52] basically everybody here has dreams
[1:37:56] but would you answer honestly that
[1:37:59] we have bad dreams
[1:38:02] you ever have a bad dream even vulgar
[1:38:04] even wrong things
[1:38:07] yeah
[1:38:10] you know that's always worrying because
[1:38:11] why
[1:38:12] because with my subconscious because
[1:38:15] that's where you dream
[1:38:17] and
[1:38:18] would my subconscious be wrong
[1:38:22] and they have a wrong dream
[1:38:24] or a wrong thought
[1:38:28] would that mean that the real me is lost
[1:38:32] you don't ever think that
[1:38:35] you're not concerned about your dreams
[1:38:38] and your things
[1:38:40] a lot of your dreams is about your past
[1:38:43] right
[1:38:44] now i was reading what the doctors had
[1:38:46] to say about it came home found what
[1:38:48] brother brown had to say
[1:38:51] scientific doctors say that dreams
[1:38:55] are based upon the part of heights
[1:38:58] implanted or
[1:39:00] in burning of your memory brain
[1:39:05] and that
[1:39:06] your dream what you've done in the day
[1:39:09] now
[1:39:10] they didn't mean that you would dream
[1:39:12] exactly wade dream he's going down
[1:39:14] cutting grass see don't get that idea
[1:39:18] it's something that happened in life
[1:39:23] and science says now this is what the
[1:39:25] man had to say he was supposed to bend a
[1:39:26] big one on it
[1:39:29] he said when you actually go through a
[1:39:30] day he said you're going through it so
[1:39:32] fast until it says your brain waves
[1:39:34] can't burn together
[1:39:36] it took me 16 years to learn to ride a
[1:39:37] bicycle
[1:39:39] burns well about 14 to ride a bicycle 16
[1:39:41] to learn swim
[1:39:43] i pretty slow
[1:39:45] playing water from the time i was a kid
[1:39:47] dove in it and everything in the world
[1:39:48] almost drowned a couple of times they
[1:39:50] had to pull me out it would happen
[1:39:52] but
[1:39:54] they say that your dreams
[1:39:57] is your endings
[1:39:58] that when your memory comes together
[1:40:01] it's like
[1:40:03] burning ends together
[1:40:06] and once it's burnt
[1:40:07] unless something severs that
[1:40:10] you can be 80 years old and if you're
[1:40:12] not godly you know might not get you
[1:40:14] training when you're
[1:40:17] you ride a bicycle
[1:40:20] you drive a car
[1:40:22] because those ends burn together
[1:40:25] dreams he said is because
[1:40:28] that those things in that day didn't get
[1:40:30] matched up
[1:40:32] so it left an open
[1:40:35] but yet it's still in the memory part
[1:40:39] it just didn't burn together to be all
[1:40:41] what it was supposed to be
[1:40:44] but he said some of the other things it
[1:40:46] gets through and you know you can just
[1:40:48] remember everything to happen because
[1:40:49] that's dementia or what you call a big
[1:40:51] word you you lose your your which one
[1:40:54] you lose your short-term memory
[1:40:56] when you've got the alzheimer's you lose
[1:40:58] your short-term because it doesn't burn
[1:41:00] together
[1:41:01] see
[1:41:02] and it can be pulled apart as we just
[1:41:04] call it
[1:41:05] i'm just trying to say something god i
[1:41:07] found what brother rather said
[1:41:11] they say this don't burn together so you
[1:41:13] left there
[1:41:16] and he said then dreams is from your
[1:41:18] conscience and your subconscious
[1:41:23] a combination now
[1:41:27] all right
[1:41:29] brother adam is the one saying this now
[1:41:32] he said dreams happen between the
[1:41:35] conscious and the subconscious and he
[1:41:37] said even are called to nightmares
[1:41:43] he said because you're conscious and
[1:41:45] your subconscious is fighting one
[1:41:46] another and you're not together he said
[1:41:49] diaries where they knew there was
[1:41:51] something different about me
[1:41:53] he said because mankind is born with
[1:41:55] those conscious and subconscious
[1:41:57] separated and they must come together
[1:42:00] and burn in and make the things and he
[1:42:02] said if you're in between there he said
[1:42:04] you're you're in a world of do it and i
[1:42:07] can even show you where he was talking
[1:42:08] that's what it was in hell hell is not a
[1:42:11] person laying in a burning
[1:42:13] pain he said that's not true
[1:42:16] he said it's like a fallen
[1:42:18] thing if you ever had a dream you just
[1:42:20] fall and you fall and you're falling
[1:42:24] but he said there's where a prophet said
[1:42:26] his consciousness subconscious
[1:42:29] was together
[1:42:31] i shouted
[1:42:32] i said god now i know
[1:42:36] that just because i have a bad dream
[1:42:40] it's before fortnite choice
[1:42:42] danny says joyce will wake up this life
[1:42:44] and like that
[1:42:45] talk to her
[1:42:49] she
[1:42:51] now she's told me this is really gonna
[1:42:53] say it she might not like it but she
[1:42:55] said she loves to drink
[1:42:57] she's shaking her head so i think
[1:42:59] she said she loves to drink
[1:43:02] i get so tickled sometimes with my
[1:43:03] dreams
[1:43:06] i was telling sister barbara i had one
[1:43:07] another day and she was in it but i've
[1:43:10] been on a trip and was coming back and i
[1:43:11] come in to pick up my clothes that's the
[1:43:13] dream
[1:43:14] i come in to get my clothes like the
[1:43:15] airport and i was getting ready to go
[1:43:17] down through there this this officer he
[1:43:19] wasn't a dress uniform policeman you
[1:43:21] know he's like an officer
[1:43:23] i remembered man he had gone that long
[1:43:26] and he was standing there
[1:43:28] and i started to get my stuff he said
[1:43:29] i'll help you
[1:43:31] well i knew what he meant
[1:43:34] and i
[1:43:35] turned around and looked at him
[1:43:38] and it's a crazy dream but i'm just
[1:43:40] telling you
[1:43:41] trying to get a point to you because i'm
[1:43:42] not a prophet my conscious and
[1:43:44] self-conscious is separated
[1:43:47] i looked at that man you know what i'm
[1:43:48] saying that's your own life because i
[1:43:50] hope the man if he ever hears it but i
[1:43:52] said do you know bill cutting him
[1:43:56] most everybody here does
[1:44:01] he said
[1:44:02] yes sir
[1:44:04] and i'll hit
[1:44:08] we get my stuff and we start out
[1:44:12] a lot of people in a bad place
[1:44:16] i knew i had to go we'd been hunting i
[1:44:17] had to go get my gun
[1:44:20] and i go over but our sister barbara
[1:44:21] she's looking down at me
[1:44:23] she sees me i don't make no contact with
[1:44:25] her because i didn't want her to get
[1:44:26] involved down here
[1:44:28] you know but she sees me
[1:44:31] i told her i said you stay praying for
[1:44:33] me enough something i'd pay back a drink
[1:44:36] that's that's something like i'm saying
[1:44:38] but
[1:44:39] i go up and you know the guns that work
[1:44:41] you know it was laying out in the grass
[1:44:43] under an old tent
[1:44:45] and this guy was down
[1:44:48] with the guns
[1:44:49] and i said sir is there some sort of
[1:44:50] certain kind of gun rifle he said yeah
[1:44:53] here it is he pulls it out when he does
[1:44:54] here's four guys three guys
[1:44:57] standing at one big one
[1:45:01] he reaches for the gun and he says here
[1:45:03] i'll take them for you
[1:45:07] and i just got into my hand and it was
[1:45:09] on bricks you know
[1:45:11] we're done bridge
[1:45:14] and i just unbridged it and haven't had
[1:45:16] that many shelters i don't know had a
[1:45:18] whole bunch of shells that done been
[1:45:19] fired
[1:45:20] so that's a dream you know
[1:45:23] i reach over the pouch
[1:45:25] and i get to
[1:45:26] one more and i slide it in
[1:45:30] when i pulled my thumb off
[1:45:33] it had also been fired
[1:45:38] but that guy didn't see it
[1:45:42] i just closed it up put my hand in i
[1:45:44] said i don't think you will
[1:45:47] well he backs off and i take off
[1:45:50] sister barber's watching me go
[1:45:54] and i'm running off the only thing i
[1:45:57] said in the dream sister barbara i said
[1:45:59] surely she'll come up there and help me
[1:46:01] get in my car
[1:46:03] because i knew i had to go from where it
[1:46:04] was back up here but i'm just telling
[1:46:06] you
[1:46:07] i've always wondered about dreams
[1:46:10] why would they be vulgar to me

[1:47:00] never forget what you've done in this
[1:47:01] life
