[27:08] come up here and stay here for a couple
[27:09] hours in a warm building so everybody
[27:13] make sure you bring extra toothpicks to
[27:15] put your eyes and keep your eyelids open
[27:18] I'll see if I make it interesting enough

[27:24] like brother like brother paints and
[27:28] said I try to get to you before you go
[27:29] to the Land of Nod so we'll see what we
[27:34] can do but we're still on the sick seal
[27:36] this is
[27:36] 9 you see we're going to talk a little
[27:38] bit about birth pains remember next
[27:44] Saturday will be the Spring Fling it'll
[27:47] be at the Guild's Mill City Park where
[27:48] it's always been and just prepare for
[27:51] that also April the 21st
[27:54] I'll be at brother Matthews in Mobile
[27:57] Alabama and every brother or my else am
[28:03] I going that's got the week after that
[28:08] so just keeps on your prayers and I've
[28:11] told you a couple months ago that there
[28:15] is an interval between the sixth seal
[28:16] and the seventh seal there's an interval
[28:18] between the sixth sixth trumpet and a
[28:21] seventh trumpet there's an interval
[28:22] between the plagues and all the
[28:24] different things there's a gap in there
[28:25] so maybe by next Sunday we'll get to the
[28:29] end of the sixth cell and then we'll
[28:30] have a gap I'll be gone a couple of
[28:31] weeks and then we'll able to be able to
[28:34] get started again in that gap because I
[28:37] believe there's something in there
[28:38] because brother Ram says in between
[28:40] there there's a prophet comes on sing
[28:42] Amen so thank God for that without a
[28:45] prophet we would we would just be
[28:47] floundering around not knowing what
[28:49] we're talking about so thank God for for
[28:52] God's sending us a prophet in the end
[28:54] time
[28:54] so let's bow our heads before we get
[28:57] started
[28:58] your Lord Jesus thank you tonight here
[29:01] we are in the middle of the week Lord to
[29:02] get a little charge to get us through
[29:05] till the weekend Father I pray that you
[29:07] would just give us all that little boost
[29:10] something Lord that we can chew on until
[29:13] next Sunday something that we can ponder
[29:17] in our heart and that we can make it
[29:21] become a part of us I just John 8 the
[29:24] book the book became part of John and
[29:26] then John began talking about the book
[29:30] lord I pray that we be that will be a
[29:33] witness that you'll be made manifest in
[29:36] our life and Lord tonight you will do
[29:40] the speaking you will do the revelation
[29:44] part Lord we sang songs
[29:47] we prayed
[29:49] for sick now it's time to hear from you
[29:52] Father we pray now that you just touch
[29:54] us be with us maybe any sick among us
[29:57] tonight we pray that you would touch
[29:58] each one heal them as we're speaking
[30:00] father that the word would go forth and
[30:03] be made manifest in flesh father forgive
[30:07] us of our sins and our many mistakes
[30:08] Lord just cover us by your blood
[30:12] we need that every moment just reading
[30:14] what the prophet said about the token we
[30:17] must apply that token and keep that
[30:19] thing over us Lord because Satan surely
[30:22] would love to disrupt this program but
[30:24] you promised that there would be a group
[30:27] of people in the end time that would
[30:30] overcome and that would crush the power
[30:35] of the devil what a wonderful thing
[30:38] thank you for that father just bless us
[30:39] now take care of us and the further one
[30:41] of this service in Jesus name we pray
[30:43] amen
[30:45] revelation 6 verse 12 and I beheld him
[30:48] we opened the sixth seal and lo there
[30:49] was a great earthquake and all this is
[30:51] nature this is all coming about nature
[30:53] there was a great earthquake that
[30:55] something happened into nature and the
[30:57] Sun became black as sackcloth of hair
[30:59] and the moon became as blood the stars
[31:02] of heaven fell unto the earth even as a
[31:03] fig tree casteth her untimely figs when
[31:05] she is shaken of a mighty wind you know
[31:09] it's kind of interesting that that this
[31:11] seal is to Israel and God puts in there
[31:16] about a fig tree we know Israel is typed
[31:19] out as a fig tree the picture I mean so
[31:22] he's telling us it's even as a fig tree
[31:23] casteth her untimely figs cuz they're
[31:25] gonna be a part they're gonna be on
[31:26] earth when this is going on 144,000 is
[31:29] gonna be brought out while this is going
[31:31] on alright when she is shaken of a
[31:33] mighty wind and they're gonna be shaken
[31:34] of a mighty wind by two prophets and man
[31:37] there's two prophets gonna just
[31:38] absolutely control nature when we get
[31:41] out of here but you and I've got to go
[31:44] through a process now to where God will
[31:46] take and destroy our old nature amen
[31:49] alright and the heaven departed as a
[31:51] scroll as it was rolled together and
[31:52] every mountain and Island were moved out
[31:54] of their places and the kings of the
[31:57] earth and the great men and the rich men
[31:58] so if you're a great men and the rich
[32:00] men and the chief captains and mighty
[32:02] man you're not gonna make the rapture
[32:05] so I says because they're still there
[32:08] and I can't in that kind of King a man

[32:18] gonna be bribed they're not gonna be
[32:20] they might be some food Spurgeon in

[32:37] just the birth plane we know the birth
[32:39] pains happening now but there will be a
[32:40] delivery you have birth pains all you
[32:43] want to but there's got a baby come
[32:45] forth there's got to something come out
[32:46] something got to be birthed and said to
[32:48] the mountain of rocks fall on us and
[32:49] hide us from the face of him that
[32:51] sitteth on the throne and from the wrath
[32:52] of the Lamb because remember the lamb is
[32:55] the redeemer for the great day of his
[32:56] wrath is come and who shall be able to
[32:58] stand let's read Romans 8 verse 19
[33:03] through 23 now let's be seated for the
[33:07] earnest expectation we've read this many
[33:09] many times but I think it needs to be be
[33:13] read again for the earnest expectation
[33:14] of the creature
[33:16] now that is creation look in your Bible
[33:19] it translates that to creation so for
[33:24] the earnest expectation of the creation
[33:26] that we were just talking about in
[33:28] Revelations waiteth for the
[33:29] manifestation of you and me and then for
[33:34] the creature our creation was made
[33:37] subject to vanity not willingly remember
[33:40] Adam sinned and the whole nature fell
[33:45] under him all right all nature fell when
[33:47] Adam fell that's why they call it a fall
[33:50] but the for the creation was made
[33:52] subject to vanity not willingly but by
[33:55] reason of him who has subjected the same
[33:57] in hope in other words there's another
[33:59] Adam coming there's another Adam that
[34:02] when that when the first Adam fell there
[34:04] was genesis 3:15 I'll put enmity between
[34:07] thy seed and the seed of the woman in
[34:08] other words I'm going to come back and
[34:10] I'm gonna write the ship I'm gonna make
[34:12] this thing come back up again because
[34:14] that's what redemption is redemption is
[34:15] not replacement redemption
[34:17] bringing up that which was fallen
[34:19] because the creation itself also shall
[34:22] be delivered from the bondage of
[34:25] corruption into the glorious liberty of
[34:26] the children of God so everything is
[34:30] tied to me and you alright if you're a
[34:32] child of God for we know I hope we do
[34:36] now for we know that the whole creation
[34:39] groaneth and travaileth in pain together
[34:43] until now and not only they but
[34:47] ourselves in other words nature's
[34:49] groaning you and I are groaning alright
[34:51] and not only they but ourselves also
[34:54] which have the firstfruits of the Spirit
[34:55] that's you and I that are born again
[34:57] even we ourselves groan within ourselves
[35:01] waiting for the adoption to wit the
[35:04] redemption of our body and man you may
[35:07] be seated in the Lord at his blessing to
[35:09] the reading of the word to win or to
[35:12] witness are to understand the redemption
[35:15] of the body and that's what we must come
[35:17] to in this sixth seal purging because
[35:21] remember of the sixth seal is the
[35:23] Tribulation Period let's finish this
[35:26] first set of quotes here just to revisit
[35:29] a little bit it's quote number one from
[35:31] the sixth seal brother Branham says this
[35:33] sixth seal is the Tribulation Period so
[35:35] we know one thing's for sure and I've
[35:37] told you many times before if I don't
[35:40] have any other revelation none if I have
[35:44] no other revelation of what I'm even
[35:45] talking about I know one thing's for
[35:47] sure nice thing about today was Alma
[35:50] over mail route I joy in the fact that
[35:55] I'm born again and I will never have to
[35:59] face a judgment
[36:00] I'm already judged there's no judgment I
[36:04] have to go - sure there's a judgment the
[36:06] deeds done - buddy that's minor stuff
[36:07] I'm not talking about if you miss this
[36:10] thing and go through that tribulation
[36:12] period you will go to the white throne
[36:15] of judgment and you will have a laundry
[36:17] list that you did do this you didn't do
[36:20] that you did do this you didn't do that
[36:22] because the Bible says you'll be judged
[36:24] by your works I never want to be judged
[36:27] by my work I want to be judged by his
[36:30] words because his works are perfect so
[36:32] if I have in that then my works are
[36:35] perfect also hey man that's what to me
[36:38] what this sixth seal is opening up more
[36:40] to me showing that how that God and man
[36:43] are so one that we're missing a point I
[36:46] remember I said before we've always
[36:48] thought maybe we were a little bit Tunis
[36:49] you know it's God over hearing me over
[36:51] here but we know it's costing us but
[36:53] waiting on him to do something are we
[36:57] waiting on him to do something or is he
[37:00] waiting on us to do something and then
[37:02] he knows the end of the story we don't
[37:05] all right so he knows what it's gonna
[37:07] take
[37:07] he wrote it in the Bible there's no
[37:10] other way he could have wrote it he
[37:11] wrote it so we could read it but this
[37:16] seal is the Tribulation Period and you
[37:18] and I definitely do not go through a
[37:20] Tribulation Period which is that that
[37:23] tribulation now sure we all go through
[37:25] daily tribulation Oh y'all don't come to
[37:30] my house come to my house we'll talk
[37:34] about tribulation because tribulation
[37:37] worketh patience we have to have
[37:38] problems and trials in life but that
[37:40] Tribulation Period is the wrath of God
[37:44] pour it out on a godless group of people
[37:47] me and brother Dale with so much other
[37:48] day do you realize that when we leave
[37:50] this earth the Holy Ghost is only gonna
[37:52] be in two people out of 7 billion people
[37:56] why do you think this earth is going to
[37:58] be in such a turmoil you said well it's
[38:00] going to be because the two prophets not
[38:01] exactly I said not exactly because if we
[38:05] don't come to our position and get this
[38:07] thing changed then they're not gonna be
[38:10] able to do their job they're over there
[38:11] now really come on they're over there
[38:13] the spirit of Elijah if you can see the
[38:15] spirit of Elijah spirit of Moses there
[38:17] oh very going
[38:19] come on bride come on bride hurry up we
[38:23] got a job to do we know what to do but
[38:26] we're in there in the Book of
[38:27] Revelations we know we're going to
[38:29] Israel you understand what I'm saying
[38:30] joys are waiting on us brother man says
[38:32] waiting on you and I water adoption time
[38:34] what we're looking at we must come less
[38:37] why's that that you don't see it preach
[38:40] so much but we must
[38:42] come to adoption we must come to where
[38:44] God can talk not with you and you say
[38:47] thus saith the Lord oh yeah brother Ram
[38:54] said the bride will have thus that the
[38:55] Lord keep still I I don't read the Bible
[38:57] where it says thus saith the Lord you
[38:58] say to this mountain it says you say to
[39:02] this mountain whatever you say
[39:05] that's why I said we must come to the
[39:06] place and what I was trying to get to
[39:08] people in the Philippines to see that we
[39:10] are God made manifest in another form
[39:11] where not a second person we are the I
[39:14] am we are the one that walked in
[39:19] eternity now not as humans we know that
[39:24] but I was identified in my and my father
[39:27] my genetics was in the man when he said
[39:31] let there be light and that same one
[39:35] that said let there be light is in you
[39:37] tonight
[39:38] that's the creator he did not become the
[39:41] creator and then he don't create anymore
[39:45] I'm there was some squirrels come to
[39:49] existence from something actually that
[39:52] was squirrels coming existence from
[39:54] nothing amen
[39:56] if you know what Jesus did watch Jesus
[39:58] when he and his life Jesus had to take
[40:00] something and then multiply it took
[40:03] bread took fish took water then we got a
[40:07] little profit step down and says I want
[40:09] you to understand one thing God is now
[40:11] manifested in human flesh and let there
[40:15] be a squirrel come out on that limb and
[40:18] you know what I don't think that
[40:19] squirrel had to get with a daddy
[40:21] squirrel in the moment squirrel to make
[40:23] a baby squirrel you understand what I
[40:25] mean then that squirrel had to eat now
[40:26] it happened just like that just like
[40:29] when that creator stood out there and
[40:30] said let there be a son let there be a
[40:33] moon let there be stars
[40:35] it happened in that same God is not a
[40:40] lesser God dwelling in you you make him
[40:44] less you make him less you put him
[40:48] through a funnel and I
[40:53] because the earnest expectation of the
[40:56] creature waiteth for the manifestation
[40:56] of send the guard the reason we come to
[40:59] a place look that's what takes place the
[41:02] bride has gone there's no living
[41:04] creature and then what's that the line
[41:05] ox man and eagle nothing there to say it
[41:08] in other words look the reason this
[41:09] world goes upside down is because there
[41:12] is no there is no grace on this earth
[41:17] and when you and I have come to a place
[41:21] that the birth pain has taken this
[41:23] person and has changed him into an
[41:28] eternal person even in this dimension
[41:31] and the dead says what something's gonna
[41:34] happen folks something's gonna happen
[41:37] when no dead Saints come out of the
[41:38] ground so it's just not gonna be a no no
[41:45] earthquakes whatever you want to call it
[41:47] something's going to happen it doesn't
[41:49] have to crack the graves open listen
[41:51] they didn't have to be an earthquake it
[41:52] that Jesus's resurrection to get to get
[41:55] the stone open to get to to get the
[41:57] stone out of the way you know the world
[41:59] didn't tilt like this so the stone could
[42:00] move no all he don't just twisted his
[42:02] finger in that thing just whip amen
[42:05] that's just way I see it but there was
[42:10] an earthquake nature had to yield to the
[42:15] man standing on earth because at that
[42:17] time when he stepped out of that tomb
[42:19] there was no man had walked like that on
[42:21] the face of the earth and then sure God
[42:24] had come down into into melchizedek and
[42:27] put a little dust on him and walked out
[42:29] and talked to Abraham he come in as the
[42:32] captain of the hosts but that wasn't our
[42:34] Savior Jesus Christ had came to earth he
[42:36] died the Prophet had to die he died for
[42:42] me and you but he didn't stay there the
[42:46] proof of the Resurrection is in you
[42:49] because that same man stepped out of
[42:50] that tomb and said all power and heaven
[42:52] earth has been given unto me it wasn't
[42:55] before he was he was caught in those
[42:59] time dimension he was caught in our
[43:02] dimension he said well we had to sleep
[43:05] he had to eat there was things he had
[43:07] because it was Yuma man he had to be
[43:09] that to be our brother because in Romans
[43:11] eight if you'll read don't don't go to
[43:13] it but in Romans eight before that it
[43:15] says we're heirs and joint heirs with
[43:16] Christ whatever he gets we get at the
[43:21] new birth but we must grow up in
[43:24] adoption to where look excuse me these
[43:31] virtues are God's attributes and when
[43:40] you get born again you get born again at
[43:42] faith you don't automatically get virtue
[43:44] you don't automatically get knowledge
[43:48] did you start as a baby and all of a
[43:50] sudden you're in college no you started
[43:53] as a baby and you come all the way up
[43:56] and you learn by the things you suffered
[44:00] how to do math I didn't because I like
[44:03] math but the English I suffered you can
[44:06] tell that by the way I talk but all
[44:08] these are what those are a victory
[44:10] those aren't overcoming when you
[44:13] overcome you overcome that what that
[44:16] knowledge that Satan gave you that
[44:20] temperance God didn't ever give you
[44:22] temper right gotten Satan Satan gives
[44:28] you all that so what you do is you have
[44:30] to take the reverse of that because
[44:33] brother Brown says so now virtues live a
[44:35] virtuous life well listen we were all
[44:36] born virgins literally we were all born
[44:40] burdens we made ourselves the other way
[44:43] but that doesn't mean virgin life that
[44:47] means power and strength coming from
[44:50] what inside of what God has given you
[44:53] that virtue came out of Jesus he didn't
[44:55] have to go get it somewhere and he
[44:56] obviously didn't have to work it up he
[44:59] did not have to work it up he just knew
[45:01] who he was when he stepped up of that
[45:04] house in the morning virtue or strength
[45:07] just went out from him amen
[45:10] so that's so that's the way it is with
[45:13] you and I each one of these is truly a
[45:16] birth pain we're birthed into all these
[45:17] that's why that's why I love the
[45:20] teaching of the statue
[45:21] perfect man and you know people just
[45:23] think we're right up here and that's
[45:24] just the way it is well that's not true
[45:26] that's why we're been here for 50 years
[45:28] that's why we've been here for 50 years
[45:31] we're not waiting on a prophet to come
[45:34] back we're waiting on us to realize what
[45:36] he's already said about us we ain't got
[45:39] that part fixed yet true we get that
[45:45] part fish we might get him back here but
[45:50] it's all hinged on me and you it's all
[45:53] hinged on what you and I can believe
[45:55] what God's already done for all right
[45:59] but thank God we do not have to go
[46:01] through that tribulation period
[46:03] but that tribulation period comes
[46:05] because you and I are gone because you
[46:08] and I remember when we come to where I
[46:10] read revelation 6 verse 12 and I'll be
[46:14] holding when he opened the sixth seal
[46:15] you and I are not here there is no bride
[46:19] in the church ages here there is no one
[46:22] here with the Holy Ghost that's why it
[46:24] brother Brown says the Tribulation
[46:26] Period is the wrath of God poured out
[46:29] upon a sinless people I mean it's then
[46:32] sending people sinners right we're not
[46:38] sinners I just told you thank God one
[46:40] night one thing I know and I've been
[46:42] it's been revealed to me that at this
[46:44] time I am gone I am NOT here anymore I
[46:49] don't have to go through that
[46:50] tribulation we may have to go through a
[46:56] little bit here but you know what that's
[46:58] just my new from what about being here
[47:01] and you cry for the rocks you you're
[47:03] multi-millionaire you've got whatever
[47:05] you got and all of a sudden you have
[47:07] nothing do you cry for the rocks to
[47:10] following you and they don't you cry for
[47:12] God to kill you because you know there's
[47:14] a wrath that's being poured out like
[47:17] never before listen these wars and
[47:18] things we've had brother Graham said
[47:20] they were temporary tribulation
[47:22] temporary even what Israel went or the
[47:25] Jews went through when when Hitler
[47:27] killed six million Jews that was a
[47:29] temporary tribulation that's nothing
[47:31] that's not not even
[47:34] dot on the map of what that tribulation
[47:36] is going to be cuz that tribulation the
[47:38] sixth seal tribulation is going to be
[47:40] worldwide worldwide nobody no one until
[47:45] God comes into two prophets and brings
[47:47] out 144,000 they're still under this
[47:49] tribulation period amen
[47:52] this whole world is still but now
[47:54] remember there's a time in this
[47:58] tribulation period of three and a half
[48:00] years that they're going to be called
[48:02] out the 1260 days that the Jews are
[48:04] going to be called out 144,000 and then
[48:07] the Battle of Armageddon is gonna happen
[48:09] then there's time left after that until
[48:12] the millennium comes in so we got to be
[48:14] really careful with that to see that
[48:16] we're gone for this whole period of any
[48:19] kind of tribulation none zero zilch nada
[48:22] but God is getting ready to put the
[48:26] world into a millennium he's gonna let
[48:29] that world rest for 1,000 years but if
[48:35] you and I have an internet into our rest
[48:37] here then you know what we're gonna be
[48:38] part of the tribulation and then so you
[48:41] and I have to enter into this
[48:42] tribulation I'm going to enter into this
[48:43] rest that's why Jesus said there's not a
[48:46] day the rest day is when you got the new
[48:49] birth your soul is at rest now what
[48:52] happens though is now you get out to the
[48:55] spirit realm and that's where God's got
[48:57] to work on us regards gotta work on us
[48:59] this is this is your spirit realm he's
[49:01] working on listen if you have the new
[49:04] birth you got gone all mighty inside of
[49:06] you actually you are God Almighty in
[49:12] that soul part that theophany is the
[49:15] same theophany of God if it's different
[49:16] then it's that then it's the devil
[49:18] that's why I said we got to quit being
[49:21] tunas it's not it's not something God
[49:23] putting in you that's different from God
[49:24] it is God that decided to put himself in
[49:29] you amen
[49:31] that's just what he decided to do it I'm
[49:33] just telling you what he said because I
[49:35] think the Bible says and I got it right
[49:37] here I in you and you and me hmm
[49:45] brother Berman said that that day he
[49:48] said that's this day so it's happening
[49:51] in this day this day these scriptures
[49:54] are being fulfilled this day you and I
[49:57] are not prophesying we are living the
[50:00] actual prophecy of the Bible and what
[50:03] the brother branham told us we are
[50:05] living that prophecy because he saw a
[50:08] group of people that would grasp it and
[50:10] it would hold on to it and it would what
[50:13] make it manifest number two well we know
[50:21] that this sixth seal is the judgment
[50:24] seal see it's the judgment seal exactly
[50:27] see we've had the Antichrist ride seeing
[50:30] the church go now it's finished goes up
[50:33] now remember the bride is gone there's
[50:36] no more bride left the rods gone then we
[50:39] see the martyrs of them Jews back there
[50:40] under the altar so much fish sealed you
[50:42] now here's the breaking fourth of the
[50:44] judgment upon the people we're out of
[50:46] this tribulation judgment will come
[50:48] forth 144,000 redeemed Jews now remember
[50:53] they are not going to be bribed they
[50:55] have fell from that position down to
[50:58] servants are they're going to be given
[51:01] the Holy Ghost but look they're not
[51:02] going to be Brian I wish you would
[51:04] really really if you've never done it
[51:07] before sit down for an hour and just
[51:09] don't think of nothing but what brother
[51:11] Dale's telling us about all along
[51:15] because that only happens to his bride
[51:21] now we know there's benefits there's
[51:24] other people that will benefit from this
[51:26] but God is there's not we were talking
[51:30] about this other day there's not 14
[51:33] different forms of eternal life there's
[51:35] only one form of eternal life but there
[51:37] are positions in that eternal life hello
[51:42] there's positions the Bible says we'll
[51:46] be kings and priests so you got to have
[51:48] something to rule over if you're a king
[51:49] and a priest right by revelations 5
[51:51] we'll be kings and priests and reign
[51:54] over this earth we don't have a position
[51:57] as the foolish virgin but the food
[51:59] virgins gonna be giving the same eternal
[52:00] life you got not a different one same
[52:03] one but you've come to a position they
[52:05] didn't never come to your bride you're
[52:10] his wife you're not a servant
[52:13] you're not imparted eternal life they
[52:16] are imparted eternal life you and I ha
[52:19] we possess it right here today we don't
[52:25] have to wait on it so I said I don't
[52:26] want I thank God I don't have to wait on
[52:28] get any turn we got it now let's use it
[52:36] to change this body into an eternal body
[52:40] hey man that's the way you'll get
[52:42] changed
[52:43] I'm sorry Abbi I'm gonna stand right
[52:45] here Abby's right in the camera tonight
[52:51] I'll prove you they're Jews and not
[52:54] Gentiles now we are to know that we know
[52:55] that ok the hundred forty-four thousand
[52:57] has nothing to do with Gentiles -
[52:59] prophets has nothing to do with Gentiles
[53:01] all right Gentiles are nations and we're
[53:05] gone we're dogs so they don't even
[53:07] listen to us but when we're out of here
[53:09] those Jews are gonna say hey you lost
[53:12] your brideship
[53:14] but I have come to save you amen
[53:18] because remember they realize that and
[53:21] they say oh my goodness we've killed our
[53:23] very Messiah he said don't worry just
[53:27] like Joseph said don't worry it was done
[53:30] for your protection it was done so I
[53:31] could take a Gentile bride and it was
[53:33] done to preserve Egypt for seven years
[53:36] of 14 years really a famine had seven
[53:39] years of good seven years of famine
[53:41] right that's the type of Christ coming
[53:44] to the Jews the Benjamin group and
[53:45] saying hey Benjamin has gone like hey we
[53:49] killed we acted like we killed our
[53:52] brother you remember they told him in
[53:53] the pit beautiful time there with Joseph
[53:56] and in Christ they have nothing to do
[54:00] with the bride not a thing the bride
[54:02] we've done seen the bride gone so we
[54:04] know in the revelations 19 he didn't
[54:06] mean the book of Acts he meant the book
[54:07] of Revelation he was a human being
[54:09] now notice for the sixth seal is the
[54:11] judgment see
[54:12] all of the word I want you to see that
[54:14] judgment still the word its listen this
[54:16] is not just one day there's a you know
[54:20] God's not setting up here with a
[54:21] calendar and there's a little red X
[54:23] right here little ice well I'm coming
[54:24] back no he's coming back when we get
[54:27] ready he's ready to come back now
[54:31] but he's waiting on you and I to come -
[54:34] what - take that eternal life to a
[54:36] position of not a bride anymore but a
[54:39] wife revelations 19 is a wife look this
[54:44] is the bride this is wife there's your
[54:50] position I didn't hear many a man's on
[54:51] that that is when you first got born
[54:57] again you look your bride and brand new
[54:59] bride and groom you're learning each
[55:01] other it's exactly what happens in your
[55:03] natural life you're learning to love
[55:06] each other
[55:06] amen but when you come up and you know
[55:09] 2030 now me and June will be 40 years
[55:11] this year some of he's more than that
[55:12] but now she's my wife revelations 19 his
[55:17] wife had made herself ready
[55:19] his wife had put on the garment what
[55:21] that garment she didn't need the eternal
[55:24] garment it's on the inside we need to
[55:28] work on the spirit realm of man don't
[55:32] worry about the flesh you don't sin with
[55:34] your flesh boy you don't your flesh
[55:40] can't sin that was born in sin but your
[55:43] flesh can't sin whatever is inside of it
[55:47] makes it do what it's doing God didn't
[55:50] have to take this unscrew this arm off
[55:52] that great beard before
[55:53] sorry some of you did too they didn't
[55:58] have to unscrew this arm off and put a
[55:59] brand new Holy Ghost
[56:00] Arminius no he cleaned this one up he
[56:04] cleaned this up he cleaned us all up
[56:07] amen and if you can't realize that then
[56:11] you need to get morning in you need to
[56:13] realize what God's already done for you
[56:17] my that's the birth pains that we birth
[56:20] planes happen every day to us it should
[56:22] happen every day but there's gonna one
[56:24] day be where we come to a place to where
[56:28] that doesn't bother us anymore brother
[56:30] branham come to places and I'm not the
[56:32] son of Charles and Ella Branham anymore
[56:33] why he wasn't denying that he wasn't a
[56:36] human anymore he just realized that God
[56:39] had transformed him so much to where he
[56:42] looked more like him Christ than he did
[56:44] his own original parents cuz it's
[56:51] obvious it's obvious he didn't have like
[56:53] his daddy
[56:54] natural his daddy was a drunk right
[56:58] fought fought people bad temper right
[57:03] and I think brother Brown might have had
[57:05] that problem when he was younger
[57:06] oh don't talk about a prophet like that
[57:08] yeah he tried to kill guy try to kill
[57:10] some kids right tried to commit suicide
[57:12] a couple times put the little thing
[57:15] around his finger the string around his
[57:17] finger and then you know the lady said
[57:19] tight ten times he said he threw the
[57:20] thing off and went running after who
[57:21] everyone yeah you know what he done God
[57:26] worked and took that temper that he had
[57:28] and showed him right there that the
[57:34] temperance had been done away with a man
[57:41] but you got to come to a place to where
[57:43] brother Brown then what do you do when
[57:45] he got the Holy Ghost he said I loved
[57:47] him
[57:47] remember he wanted to kill that guy that
[57:49] he said I wanted to kill home table
[57:52] kill the man that remember he gave him a
[57:54] gave Fritz a little button you know the
[57:57] we used to call them poison
[57:59] poisoned his dog killed him he said I'm
[58:01] gonna kill that man I see him on the
[58:03] street I'm gonna kill him that's what he
[58:04] said he said but what do you do he said
[58:07] after I got born again he said I
[58:08] actually witnessed to the man baptize
[58:10] him in the name of Jesus Christ so you
[58:12] know what there's transforming power
[58:14] that was a birth pain the Prophet had to
[58:16] go through the birth plan you and I all
[58:18] have to go through and we're not getting
[58:21] anywhere I was gonna be real short for
[58:22] witness tonight so anyway alright number
[58:26] three the Seventh Seal now what are the
[58:28] age of the Eagle the revelation to be
[58:30] revealed the whole thing now compare
[58:33] this with revelations to 10th chapter
[58:35] verse one through seven and we'll see
[58:37] here in this revelations here
[58:38] ten one two seven that in the days of
[58:41] the sounding of the seventh angels
[58:42] message was to finish up excuse me all
[58:45] the mysteries of God now that's not what
[58:50] the Bible says remember the Bible says
[58:52] mystery there's only one mystery and you
[58:57] know what that mystery is Christ in you
[58:59] the hope of glory that's what the Bible
[59:02] says Christ in not Christ in William
[59:04] Branham Christ in you Christ in you
[59:06] makes you part of that amen and you got
[59:12] to be revealed so what the mystery to me
[59:14] the whole mystery is John top-tall the
[59:16] bride well he's the one that wrote about
[59:18] it in Revelations 10 then John takes the
[59:21] little book John eats the little book
[59:23] and John prophesize so I believe it's
[59:27] John the top of the bride the old bride
[59:29] here's John chopping the bride doing the
[59:33] work says in the days of the voice of
[59:37] the seventh angel but remember when John
[59:39] went to take the book he did not take it
[59:40] out of the seventh angel messengers hand
[59:42] he took it out of the mighty angels hand
[59:44] if we don't get this message to Christ
[59:47] we have lost everything
[59:49] amen I love that I wish we had one of
[59:53] those maybe I'll go to brother Claus and
[59:55] steal it from him he's got a picture a
[59:58] big picture of brother Branham when he
[1:00:03] some of you read the old indictment book
[1:00:05] the old book he's got that picture of
[1:00:07] brother Branham pointing in this
[1:00:08] direction like this well he's got that
[1:00:11] picture big like this but right beside
[1:00:14] of it is that he's sitting in underneath
[1:00:17] it says only a true prophet will point
[1:00:19] you to Christ so you can see where he's
[1:00:21] pointing right straight to Christ all
[1:00:23] right Christ is the theme of this whole
[1:00:25] thing not not even ourselves all right
[1:00:30] we're mad now we find out this is the
[1:00:32] sixth seal now being open it was for a
[1:00:35] three-fold purpose all right now what
[1:00:37] we're going to talk about now here was
[1:00:38] the purposes three of them the first
[1:00:41] thing was the sleeping virgins had to go
[1:00:43] through the tribulation period for
[1:00:44] purification we know that all right
[1:00:48] the five wise in the five foolish five
[1:00:50] wives left if I foods had to stay and go
[1:00:52] through
[1:00:52] tribulation period she had to be purged
[1:00:55] of her sins of unbelief and rejecting
[1:00:57] the message this she was done in the
[1:01:01] tribulation period well that's what the
[1:01:03] foolish virgin is she's really a virgin
[1:01:05] I mean she's virgin she's come to a
[1:01:07] place to where she thinks he's clean and
[1:01:11] got the Holy Ghost but she doesn't have
[1:01:13] the Holy Ghost that's why she has to go
[1:01:14] through the tribulation but she'll be
[1:01:15] given eternal life for what she stands
[1:01:18] for and the tribulation period she will
[1:01:21] be killed
[1:01:22] because that's why this she was done in
[1:01:25] the tribulation period we see they wind
[1:01:27] up over here in Revelation 7 between the
[1:01:30] 6th and 7th chapter that she had been
[1:01:31] purged and she had been given her robes
[1:01:34] all right now now she's not the bride
[1:01:37] but it's the church the pure people that
[1:01:39] that didn't have the opportunity maybe
[1:01:42] to receive the message or in some way
[1:01:44] that they were blinded by these false
[1:01:46] prophets false message preachers and
[1:01:49] they didn't get a chance and yet there's
[1:01:52] really since they're in heart and God
[1:01:54] knows our heart that's the whole thing
[1:01:55] God knows your heart and here they're
[1:01:57] purged during this time you notice that
[1:02:00] another purging time that's for Israel
[1:02:02] when she's gathered that's the second
[1:02:05] fold of the second 2nd thing God purges
[1:02:08] Israel in the tribulation period now not
[1:02:10] all of Israel out of the millions that
[1:02:13] will gather there now remember they're
[1:02:15] all gathering to the homeland looking
[1:02:17] for the Messiah but only 144,000 is
[1:02:20] going to know that the Messiah's already
[1:02:22] come that's the second fold God purges
[1:02:25] Israel in the tribulation period out of
[1:02:27] the millions that will gather there
[1:02:28] there'll be a selected 144,000 and
[1:02:31] they'll be purged also God's purging
[1:02:34] Israel why because of all the things
[1:02:35] they did rejecting them at the cross and
[1:02:38] all those different things let his blood
[1:02:39] be on us and our children they they fell
[1:02:42] from being bride but they do get a
[1:02:45] position that's in this one telling
[1:02:47] about they they fell from one position
[1:02:49] to another position but they're still
[1:02:50] gonna get eternal life but they're never
[1:02:52] gonna be able to be bride okay but
[1:02:55] they'll have eternal life notice there's
[1:02:58] a whole earth now this is number three
[1:02:59] there's a whole earth to be is to be
[1:03:01] purged there'll be such a thing that the
[1:03:05] moon stars at
[1:03:06] all nature will be purged you see what
[1:03:09] it is the earth is renewing herself
[1:03:12] being purged getting ready for the
[1:03:14] Millennium the Millennium is coming up
[1:03:16] and see everything that's got it filth
[1:03:18] in it has to be purged during the sixth
[1:03:21] seal because listen when we're when
[1:03:22] we're gone God for three and a half
[1:03:25] years is going to he's going to pour out
[1:03:28] tribulation on the whole world then in
[1:03:32] the middle of 70th weeks about
[1:03:34] Armageddon so brother Burton says the
[1:03:38] Battle of Armageddon well after the
[1:03:40] Battle of Armageddon well what's the
[1:03:41] Battle of Armageddon
[1:03:42] it's all heck breaks loose the whole
[1:03:46] world goes into an atomic chaos right
[1:03:48] but we come back into millennium it's
[1:03:50] cleaned off enough for Christ to come
[1:03:52] back and put his feet on the earth but I
[1:03:55] believe this is just me this is my this
[1:03:57] is my quote I can't find one more
[1:03:59] brother Brown said it but I'm just gonna
[1:04:01] say it this way the reason Christ can
[1:04:03] come back is because we've already
[1:04:05] stepped here in glorified bodies hello
[1:04:12] we've already had a body change way
[1:04:15] before that way before the Millennium
[1:04:18] Stars let's just say we all get a body
[1:04:21] change tomorrow
[1:04:22] well crock still can't come on the earth
[1:04:24] right remember we meet him in the air
[1:04:26] with our glorified our glorified eternal
[1:04:31] boy that ought to make old people having
[1:04:32] a horrifying eternal body a man then we
[1:04:36] meet him in the air go to the marriage
[1:04:38] supper while all this is going on
[1:04:40] wedding supper and while this is all
[1:04:42] going on then we come back with him in
[1:04:45] Revelations 19 as the wife coming back
[1:04:48] into the Millennium to live the thousand
[1:04:51] years but you know what means nothing to
[1:04:53] us
[1:04:56] but if Christ is coming back with us and
[1:04:58] he's got this whole group of seven
[1:05:00] Church ages they've all got their body
[1:05:02] changed he's had a body change the long
[1:05:04] time ago but now he's being able to step
[1:05:07] into this dimension because you and I as
[1:05:10] recipients of the perfection of Christ
[1:05:13] year what I'm saying as recipients of
[1:05:15] the perfection of Christ we're already
[1:05:18] on this earth cleaning it off
[1:05:20] when we leave that's fine when we leave
[1:05:23] this this world's going hey hey he
[1:05:26] forgot us this thing needs to be changed
[1:05:31] and all we gonna do is say hey we'll be
[1:05:33] back don't worry let me clean all this
[1:05:36] sin off let it burn all this junk off
[1:05:38] for a little while we'll come back but
[1:05:42] remember as brother Dale's been
[1:05:43] preaching even the millennium is not an
[1:05:48] eternal position it is for us but this
[1:05:52] world is not completely eternal at the
[1:05:54] time it's just us that walk on it cuz
[1:05:59] we're God can't be y'all at all cuz you
[1:06:01] got dead Saints that lived not for a
[1:06:03] thousand years you got the foolish
[1:06:05] version you've got a cup of water in my
[1:06:07] name you've got all those ones that are
[1:06:09] dead that's got to come up to the white
[1:06:10] throne judgment well then he's not all
[1:06:12] in all he's all in all in his bride he's
[1:06:16] all in all in 144,000 and the fifth
[1:06:18] sealed you but not the whole world then
[1:06:21] the whole world's got to be judged at
[1:06:23] the white throne judgment but oh thank
[1:06:26] God we don't have to stand in that we're
[1:06:28] standing in the judgment not being
[1:06:31] judged oh man come on people
[1:06:34] good grief whatever you do
[1:06:37] sure repent get it over and get it done
[1:06:40] with but you can't sin enough to be lost
[1:06:43] if you're born again a man I notice
[1:06:47] worth Aaron they don't stir you soup you
[1:06:52] babies fell out of your bowl I finally
[1:06:54] said it anyway what was I notice there's
[1:07:01] a whole earth to be purged it will be
[1:07:03] such a thing as the moon I remember when
[1:07:06] I see that word earth you know if those
[1:07:09] evenness been heard me many many many
[1:07:11] times when I see earth that word earth
[1:07:14] I don't think of this round ball that
[1:07:16] we're sitting on standing on cause death
[1:07:19] Earth's got to be changed first
[1:07:21] this Earth's got to go through birth
[1:07:23] pains this earths got to go through an
[1:07:25] earthquake amen this earths got to go
[1:07:29] through a purging you and I must come
[1:07:32] that six Neil Peart
[1:07:33] is so sanctified till it sanctifies that
[1:07:36] outside person you're sitting in right

[1:07:45] what's inside of you is young already I
[1:07:47] hope you understand that when I look at
[1:07:51] you I don't look at age I look at a 20
[1:07:54] year old person district Lena you laugh
[1:08:02] oh you won't - I don't see her as an old
[1:08:05] person I see her as a young vibrant Lea
[1:08:08] you said well get up on the bed and
[1:08:10] you'll know that that sense that
[1:08:12] circumstance is in this dimension we
[1:08:15] gotta let that thing it's inside of us
[1:08:17] out our stinking thinking's wants
[1:08:22] putting us in the grave okay okay so the
[1:08:30] world the whole earth so you and I have
[1:08:32] to go first because the whole world is
[1:08:35] waiting on you and I I read that revel
[1:08:38] in Romans waiting on the manifestation
[1:08:41] of the sons of God so that you and I
[1:08:43] will come to a place to where your body
[1:08:46] will yield to what's inside of it that's
[1:08:53] what's gonna happen
[1:08:54] your theophany is not hanging in heaven
[1:08:56] somewhere you are your theophany you are
[1:08:59] that Holy Ghost inside of you that is
[1:09:01] your theophany and it's not the soul
[1:09:04] away Dale anymore it's a soul of
[1:09:06] Almighty God we just haven't been able
[1:09:13] to believe that yet I'm just telling you
[1:09:18] what he said what's gonna happen let's
[1:09:22] look at this next quote we all know
[1:09:26] that's the identification we know what
[1:09:28] the third pulley is when that we're
[1:09:30] gonna read another quote for brother Ram
[1:09:31] we know the third pole is the opening
[1:09:32] the word the third pole with the opening
[1:09:34] of the seven seals all right this is
[1:09:37] 1964 we all know that's the
[1:09:40] identification we know what the third
[1:09:43] pole is we all understand that I doubt
[1:09:47] that
[1:09:47] at that time but we should now more
[1:09:50] understand it than ever because look
[1:09:53] come on people the third pole is not a
[1:09:55] it's not an event of a tent or an
[1:10:01] airplane I'll tell you what he said it
[1:10:06] was right he was opening the word it's a
[1:10:08] word
[1:10:09] pull it's the third pull what pulling
[1:10:11] you is the word of God not some event we
[1:10:17] all understand that because watch if
[1:10:18] they listen if the third pop will let's
[1:10:20] just read it now you got you have the
[1:10:22] tape I think it'll just lay dormant for
[1:10:25] a while hmm
[1:10:28] now the third pulled open any of the
[1:10:30] word that can't lay dormant but the
[1:10:33] manifestation of it can alright because
[1:10:37] the third pole is what's gonna get us
[1:10:38] out of here that's what's gonna get us
[1:10:41] out of here the opening of the word is
[1:10:42] what's gonna get us out of here the
[1:10:44] third pole is going to be what speaking
[1:10:46] the word and stuff comes to pass cuz
[1:10:49] what at what brother Brown towel that
[1:10:51] too he tied it to the fish he tied it to
[1:10:53] the squirrels he tied it to had he right
[1:10:55] he tied it to sister meter all those
[1:10:57] five things that went that happened was
[1:10:59] because of what he said and another not
[1:11:04] an event sure we had events we had the
[1:11:07] cloud we had the picture and all that
[1:11:09] that's not what he put it on he put that
[1:11:11] third pole on the opening of the word
[1:11:13] amen and I think that it'll just lay
[1:11:16] dormant for a little while until the
[1:11:18] great hour persecution now that our
[1:11:20] persecution is not here oh yeah we got a
[1:11:24] little minor persecution I'm talking
[1:11:26] about
[1:11:26] that's when it be it'll speak it'll be
[1:11:30] manifested just like the five straight
[1:11:31] signs without failure perfectly now I
[1:11:34] think just wait see what it done now I'm
[1:11:36] going back same again through and
[1:11:38] through to find out in other words he's
[1:11:40] going back to Jefferson villain thinks
[1:11:42] what he was doing but I was go the next
[1:11:44] one I'm just telling you what he said
[1:11:48] now remember notice the very day when
[1:11:51] this messenger not when he starts on in
[1:11:54] other words not in the healing campaign
[1:11:56] that was not the prophets message
[1:12:00] right it was not his message it was
[1:12:04] debate on the hook he wanted you to get
[1:12:06] the hook not the bait but you have to
[1:12:09] have bait on the hook now went not when
[1:12:13] he starts on but when he begins to
[1:12:15] declare his message now that's the
[1:12:18] opening of the seals
[1:12:19] cuz I'll fear oh well here it is see the
[1:12:21] first pool healing that was the first
[1:12:23] part of his ministry second pool
[1:12:25] prophesying what take people by the
[1:12:27] instead of taking him by the hand he was
[1:12:28] stick there and tell them what was in
[1:12:30] their heart third pull the opening of
[1:12:31] the word what the seals the mysteries
[1:12:33] revealed no more there's no more higher
[1:12:35] order to reveal the word than profit so
[1:12:37] we hadn't have a profit in the end time
[1:12:40] but the only way the profit can be
[1:12:42] vindicated is by the word and remember
[1:12:46] the third pole was the opening of them
[1:12:48] seven seals to reveal the hidden truth
[1:12:50] that's been sealed in the word do you
[1:12:53] see it congregation says they man I
[1:12:55] doubt they did but anyway we see it we
[1:12:59] should we're recipients of that
[1:13:04] everybody all right with that you are
[1:13:07] the recipient of that I read you about
[1:13:09] ten times during this whole seal seal
[1:13:12] series where brother Branham said it's
[1:13:15] gone from you it's not for you you're
[1:13:17] not supposed to get it he's talking
[1:13:19] about them on questions and answers he
[1:13:21] said just go and live a simple life it's
[1:13:25] not for you well it's got to be for
[1:13:28] somebody because God don't just cast his
[1:13:30] word on it it will not return void it
[1:13:34] will accomplish what it said well the
[1:13:35] accomplishment is now you and I now have
[1:13:38] seen those seals open and we see we see
[1:13:42] the Thunder underneath the seal that
[1:13:46] it's not just the white horse riders the
[1:13:48] Antichrist it's not just a red horse
[1:13:49] rider than Chanukah no it's the plan of
[1:13:52] redemption it's the full plan of
[1:13:54] redemption not just the born-again
[1:13:56] experience but the full man the full
[1:13:59] when the seventh seal is revealed that's
[1:14:02] God standing on earth in human flesh
[1:14:06] your flesh
[1:14:10] he's not gotta flesh on earth besides
[1:14:15] you alright let's look at this real
[1:14:19] quick flip all right roll it up to the
[1:14:26] next one so let's just look we did this
[1:14:29] last Sunday or the outlier Sunday so
[1:14:31] let's just back up just a minute
[1:14:32] FIF seals justification we look and see
[1:14:34] that now what is justification
[1:14:36] justification is what the real you
[1:14:39] didn't do it not just now look baby form
[1:14:41] justification is that God forgive you of
[1:14:43] your past sins he has justified you but
[1:14:47] old root of evil is still there that's
[1:14:50] not what this we're up higher now
[1:14:52] everybody okay with that I know
[1:14:54] something's not been here I'm trying to
[1:14:55] go back through a little bit but baby
[1:14:57] form justification is God's chopped off
[1:14:59] your past sins never to remember me any
[1:15:01] more but the next day you're going to
[1:15:03] keep sending because the same old root
[1:15:04] of evil is still there and then but God
[1:15:07] is just to forgive you as if you didn't
[1:15:11] do it then when you become sanctified in
[1:15:18] baby form sanctification and
[1:15:19] justification baby for him brother Brown
[1:15:21] said God picks the glass up called you
[1:15:23] wants to do something with it
[1:15:24] alright why does he do it sanctification
[1:15:26] he washes it out clean and set aside for
[1:15:30] service amen if he cleans and set aside
[1:15:34] for service then what's he going to do
[1:15:36] he's going to come in by the Holy Ghost
[1:15:38] in fire he's going to put something in
[1:15:41] that glass and seal it that's why
[1:15:46] there's only one seal grieve not the
[1:15:49] Holy Spirit of God whereby you are
[1:15:51] sealed unto the day of your redemption
[1:15:54] all right if you don't have the Holy
[1:15:55] Ghost you don't understand what I'm
[1:15:56] saying anyway and then so you got to
[1:15:59] have the Holy Ghost the one that's the
[1:16:00] one that's talking to you tonight it's
[1:16:02] the same one that wrote the book I'm not
[1:16:05] talking about me I'm talking about if I
[1:16:07] quote you the word that's the word
[1:16:08] quoting the word but this justification
[1:16:12] is not as if you didn't do it it's not
[1:16:15] just chopping off your past then no
[1:16:17] we've come to a justification where that
[1:16:19] fifth seal
[1:16:20] Jew God had to completely wipe their
[1:16:24] slate clean and they didn't even want it
[1:16:29] what about grace you and I one day we
[1:16:34] don't want it remember you didn't go
[1:16:38] looking for God God come looking for you
[1:16:41] and what's the first thing we did right
[1:16:47] but he caught you because he wants you
[1:16:51] to come to a place of this justification
[1:16:53] in this fifth seal justification where
[1:16:56] the real you didn't do it anyway tell my
[1:17:00] grace
[1:17:00] he gave me eternal life to a fifth seal
[1:17:03] Jew that did not even care he was on the
[1:17:06] earth the Messiah they were killed under
[1:17:10] Eichmann and Hitler just because they
[1:17:12] were Jews not because they were
[1:17:14] religious not because they knew the
[1:17:15] message of the hour they weren't even
[1:17:17] born again but God had to blind their
[1:17:20] eyes purposely so that you and I could
[1:17:23] come in a man so he gives them eternal
[1:17:25] life he so justifies everything they do
[1:17:29] to where excuse me they have white robes
[1:17:35] think about that that that's not just as
[1:17:39] if you didn't do it the real you didn't
[1:17:42] do it them inside of the inside never
[1:17:45] send a Danish life but do we realize
[1:17:51] that and then this six self
[1:17:54] sanctification what is sanctification
[1:17:56] cleaned and set aside for service
[1:18:00] something's got to be cleaned and set
[1:18:02] aside before the Millennium can come
[1:18:04] amen
[1:18:06] something's got to be clean and set
[1:18:07] aside before you get a body change
[1:18:11] because remember I said this thing don't
[1:18:14] sin it doesn't but it is sinful
[1:18:16] it was born in sin it was shapen in
[1:18:19] iniquity came the wrong way amen but you
[1:18:22] know what God's gonna do with the Holy
[1:18:23] Ghost and fire when that seventh seal
[1:18:25] hits the earth he's gonna burn every
[1:18:27] molecule that you got from your mom and
[1:18:30] Daddy
[1:18:33] and change you not at everybody same
[1:18:38] body it'd be real easy to throw this one
[1:18:42] away and get you another one but that's
[1:18:44] not Redemption that's replacement listen
[1:18:49] when the Prophet stood one day and he
[1:18:52] said God took this one and bred him to
[1:18:55] this one he took this one and bred him
[1:18:58] to this one took this one and bred them
[1:19:01] to this one just to get you here think
[1:19:04] of how you came just think think back
[1:19:07] how you can't think about how your mama
[1:19:09] came hey your mama's mama how your
[1:19:11] daddy's mama how they all met just to
[1:19:13] get you here
[1:19:14] because there was an image there was an
[1:19:16] image in God's mind he was going to have
[1:19:18] it it didn't matter what you might have
[1:19:21] somebody lives over here and somebody
[1:19:22] lives over there and they were telling
[1:19:24] me a story in the Philippines I'll not
[1:19:26] go through it for say time but it was
[1:19:27] just miraculous how they got together
[1:19:29] hated each other's guts got married and
[1:19:35] had a preacher that was standing there I
[1:19:38] thought well my take two people hate
[1:19:41] each other
[1:19:45] humanly but then they fell in love and
[1:19:48] had him and then here he is a wonderful
[1:19:50] message preacher in the Philippines I
[1:19:52] mean you know I'm God works in
[1:19:53] mysterious ways but he but he did he
[1:19:55] listened God's got this whole thing he
[1:19:57] had to bring your image that's what he
[1:19:59] saw before the foundation world he's got
[1:20:00] to bring it here he's got to bring it
[1:20:03] here because you're his children now we
[1:20:06] know he had to come through flesh we
[1:20:08] know we had to come through that because
[1:20:09] why because the fall but look right here
[1:20:14] we got to believe that we are him
[1:20:19] brother BAM I'll read the quote she is
[1:20:22] him now remember there is no way even
[1:20:26] after 40 years of marriage June and I if
[1:20:28] we went to the doctor and they took a
[1:20:31] DNA test they would see two separate
[1:20:33] people because my DNA is different from
[1:20:35] hers because she came from her parents
[1:20:37] and I came from mine right but now we
[1:20:40] got to go back to Adam and Eve
[1:20:44] we got to go back to Adam and Eve where
[1:20:46] you took Adam if you could take a hair
[1:20:48] from Adam and a hair from Eve put it
[1:20:51] under the microscope and and the
[1:20:53] scientists would go there's no way
[1:20:58] there's no way these two people can have
[1:21:01] the same exact DNA because the Bible
[1:21:04] says we'll have a body like unto his
[1:21:06] glorious body we will be changed in our
[1:21:08] DNA not to change our shape but to be to
[1:21:14] be him she is him she's not like him The
[1:21:19] Devil's like him
[1:21:20] she is him who I said with we're not the
[1:21:25] I am would probably be I was or they I'm
[1:21:28] gonna be but I like I am ever-present
[1:21:35] for eternity
[1:21:37] all right let's read a couple quotes
[1:21:39] here I'm not gonna get finished between
[1:21:40] the one I got Sunday I love this thank
[1:21:43] your brother Dale let's read this watch
[1:21:47] this right here
[1:21:50] that's what he proved hallelujah that's
[1:21:52] what Easter proved he wasn't only the
[1:21:55] word was he something else no but he was
[1:21:58] God himself
[1:21:59] now watch now we can say amen to that
[1:22:03] but can you put your name in there yeah
[1:22:05] can you read the Bible where it says
[1:22:10] then the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:22:12] among us and not think of Jesus it's you
[1:22:19] he's the first fruit he's already done
[1:22:21] his job and he's left he's come back to
[1:22:23] give you that scripture because if it's
[1:22:26] I and you and you and me hey listen let
[1:22:28] me get back to my point here just a
[1:22:29] second there's no way that Jun and I can
[1:22:31] be one as that is one we're always
[1:22:35] different DNA because God had to breed
[1:22:37] this woman to this wood listen listen
[1:22:39] listen listen to get you air because of
[1:22:41] the sin curse because of the natural
[1:22:43] between husband and wife coming together
[1:22:45] and having a baby all right but still I
[1:22:48] submit brother Graham said that's more a
[1:22:50] miraculous than the virgin birth when
[1:22:52] you've got billions of cells released
[1:22:54] and meant in many eggs release and then
[1:22:56] here you are
[1:22:58] all the rest of them died except you the
[1:23:00] virgin birth was God created an egg and
[1:23:02] sperm put it in a woman that was pretty
[1:23:04] simple but to get you here think about
[1:23:07] it don't think of yourself as something
[1:23:10] special but you are something special
[1:23:12] you got brought here special we all got
[1:23:15] here the same way but but we were still
[1:23:18] special in God's eyes but he was God
[1:23:22] himself the dynamics in the word don't
[1:23:24] you listen this real clothes that made
[1:23:27] the body of Jesus Christ because
[1:23:33] remember like I said if we're going back
[1:23:35] to the Garden of Eden we got to go back
[1:23:37] to where our DNA is the same as his
[1:23:41] husband and wife are truly one listen
[1:23:44] Adam and Eve were definitely one they
[1:23:48] were one her DNA and his DNA you put
[1:23:51] them under that look fitting but see you
[1:23:55] can't you can't ever do that now because
[1:23:57] we come from separate DNA our DNA comes
[1:23:59] all the way down from one side of the
[1:24:01] family and the other well not with Adam
[1:24:03] and Eve they were created God's gonna
[1:24:07] create again he's gonna create again
[1:24:10] he's gonna put us right into the
[1:24:12] position we were supposed to be had
[1:24:13] there not been a fall
[1:24:14] that's redemption redemption that's not
[1:24:16] taking this and dropping it down here
[1:24:19] and then putting it over here if it fell
[1:24:22] from here
[1:24:23] that's where God's got to put it back if
[1:24:26] it fell from right here which with Adam
[1:24:27] and Eve one same DNA same theophany
[1:24:36] thank the orphan II mm-hmm
[1:24:40] that's what brother Graham said shake
[1:24:45] into life and rise again roll away the
[1:24:48] stone that look the body of Jesus Christ
[1:24:50] now on Saturday
[1:24:51] his body was cold stiff dead and in the
[1:24:53] grave amen shook him to life and rise
[1:24:57] again and roll away the stone I am he
[1:25:00] that was dead so dead till the son said
[1:25:03] he was dead the moon said he was dead
[1:25:04] the star said he was dead
[1:25:06] all nature said he was dead
[1:25:11] all nature said he was dead what are we
[1:25:14] talking about nature and now the whole
[1:25:17] world has to recognize that he's alive
[1:25:20] again he was not only in the mechanics
[1:25:25] God's Word he was the dynamics to prove
[1:25:28] it
[1:25:29] excuse me and as he being the groom
[1:25:32] listen list as he being the groom the
[1:25:36] bride has to come forth cuz it's a
[1:25:40] second person of him Oh cuz it's a part
[1:25:45] of him and it can only be the
[1:25:49] manifestation of the full filling of all
[1:25:52] the revelations any others have spoke of
[1:25:55] the bride the whole Bible speaks of you
[1:26:01] listen I told you many years before
[1:26:04] you're not a type you're the bride Oh
[1:26:09] everything types the bride in the Bible
[1:26:12] but you are the bride you're not a
[1:26:18] second person it can only manifest all
[1:26:24] the revelations others have spoke of the
[1:26:26] bride
[1:26:27] it can only manifest if it does
[1:26:29] something different from the groom it
[1:26:31] isn't the bride because she is flesh of
[1:26:34] his flesh Adam said that before the fall
[1:26:38] he looked at him and he said she is
[1:26:40] flesh of my flesh bone of my bone life
[1:26:44] of my life power of his power she is him
[1:26:47] as man and women are what woman are one
[1:26:52] excuse me that tape didn't say I didn't
[1:26:54] say women woman you only have one wife
[1:26:56] as man and woman are one why would you
[1:27:00] want another one and man and woman are
[1:27:02] one and woman taken from his side where
[1:27:05] were you and I taken from the side of
[1:27:08] Christ at Calvary she had taken a spirit
[1:27:11] the feminist spirit from him the flesh
[1:27:14] from his side and made both mechanics
[1:27:17] and dynamics the wife the spirit of him
[1:27:22] and the flesh of Hey
[1:27:25] and put it together and made mechanics
[1:27:28] and dynamics until the church or the
[1:27:31] people until that church becomes both
[1:27:35] dynamics and mechanics and the Spirit of
[1:27:37] God that moved him to do the things that
[1:27:39] he did if he hit on 16 cylinders so will
[1:27:43] the bride a man for he said in John
[1:27:46] 14:12 he didn't believeth on me the
[1:27:47] works that I do shall he do also I'll
[1:27:50] give him a charge of my dynamics in his
[1:27:53] mechanics that the world will not be
[1:27:56] able to withstand it there's your birth
[1:27:58] pains the world can't hold us here and I
[1:28:03] will raise him up again at the last day
[1:28:04] that's the Easter message the dynamics
[1:28:07] and the mechanics together the mechanics
[1:28:10] without the dynamics no good neither is
[1:28:13] the dynamics without the mechanics you
[1:28:16] can scream and shout and jump up and
[1:28:18] down all you won't do and deny this word
[1:28:20] it won't do you any good
[1:28:22] you're just cranking around the Pistons
[1:28:24] got the spark there but no gasoline to
[1:28:26] fire it'll only work as they come
[1:28:28] together amen so one will sell set still
[1:28:32] and the other will go up that's the only
[1:28:34] thing there is to it in other words the
[1:28:36] church will stay here and abroad will go
[1:28:37] up yet they both look alike both claim
[1:28:41] to be churches both claims to be bride
[1:28:44] but one has mechanics and dynamics it
[1:28:48] brings it to pass of what he said is the
[1:28:50] truth it just won't move no matter how
[1:28:52] good the mechanics is until the dynamics
[1:28:54] come when the dynamics come that fire is
[1:28:59] made to connect with that octane in the
[1:29:02] gasoline and when that explodes it
[1:29:05] causes the combustion and that
[1:29:08] combustion moves every motion every move
[1:29:11] for he is the same yesterday today and
[1:29:14] forever we're gonna literally explode
[1:29:21] what's inside of us can't hold what's on
[1:29:24] the outside we're gonna literally
[1:29:25] explode and we're gonna see all this not
[1:29:31] too far not too far in the future we're
[1:29:34] not we're looking right at it now we
[1:29:36] just got to get we just got to get some
[1:29:37] things in all
[1:29:38] here okay that all right all right let's
[1:29:41] read this right here number seven
[1:29:45] I've been going pretty good so much
[1:29:47] don't even a 30 yet
[1:29:49] that's the divine revelation of the word
[1:29:52] made flesh now this is the rising of the
[1:29:54] Sun it's a Content it's not a
[1:29:55] continuation it's down a little bit
[1:29:57] further paragraph 168 what is the divine
[1:30:02] revelation of the word made flesh he'll
[1:30:08] tell you right there that's the divine
[1:30:11] revelation of the word made flesh if it
[1:30:13] was flesh in that day by the Sun the
[1:30:18] groom it's the flesh today by the bride
[1:30:23] we have spent 50 years trying to get
[1:30:27] this flesh lined up when these little
[1:30:30] devils going on inside and this thing
[1:30:32] gonna ever do you any good this flesh
[1:30:34] yeah do you understand your Flash don't
[1:30:37] sin your flesh don't sin the motivator
[1:30:42] inside of it does it I don't hold a beer
[1:30:45] anymore I still got same hand you got
[1:30:48] same mouth say some really bad things
[1:30:50] out of it i'ma tried one time to wash it
[1:30:54] out with soap that doesn't really do any
[1:30:56] good it's kind of temporary but once I
[1:31:00] got she did but once I got the inside
[1:31:03] wash battle ouya once I got the inside
[1:31:06] wash she didn't have to wash my mouth
[1:31:07] anymore God washed it he watched it by
[1:31:11] the new birth so it's the flesh today by
[1:31:14] the bride who soever sins you're a
[1:31:17] mental or brother branham goodness
[1:31:22] gracious because remember I think before
[1:31:25] this there was a woman remember after
[1:31:28] the marriage and divorce situation
[1:31:29] brother branham this woman comes up and
[1:31:31] says you made yourself God you forgive
[1:31:32] them of their sins he's telling the
[1:31:35] truth
[1:31:36] whosoever sins you remit are remitted
[1:31:40] whosoever sins you retain to them are
[1:31:42] retained
[1:31:44] you know my example of that you know
[1:31:49] when we walked through the world how
[1:31:52] the world gonna be judged they're gonna
[1:31:53] be judged by you you will judge the
[1:31:57] world and whosoever sins you remit their
[1:32:03] remitted God changes your tire he don't
[1:32:07] really care anything about the Lord he
[1:32:09] just does you a good favor and then we
[1:32:11] get over to the other side God gives
[1:32:13] them eternal life because you're gonna
[1:32:15] sit there and you're gonna say Lord you
[1:32:17] said a cup of water in your name on
[1:32:21] earth will not be forgetting forgotten
[1:32:23] in heaven well whose remitting the sin
[1:32:24] we know Christ is but through you that
[1:32:28] person will get eternal life but now it
[1:32:31] works the other way too
[1:32:34] whosoever sins you retain to them they
[1:32:37] are retained be careful now the Catholic
[1:32:42] Church picked it up and takes it to the
[1:32:44] priest but that's carnal watch it was
[1:32:47] the spiritual revealed word that did it
[1:32:51] not an emotion but the spiritually
[1:32:54] revealed word that did it alright man
[1:32:59] seeds not air with a shock let's read
[1:33:01] this and I'm gonna stop right here
[1:33:02] because I'll pick it up Sunday that all
[1:33:04] right then Along Came sanctification how
[1:33:07] many believes in sanctification sure
[1:33:09] clean and set aside for service brother
[1:33:10] branham hmm he's not talking about that
[1:33:12] anymore watch what he's saying down here
[1:33:15] he's not talking about that saying that
[1:33:17] we're not talk about that sanctification
[1:33:18] anymore listen if you've got to be
[1:33:20] sanctified like the first part of
[1:33:23] sanctification you're still dirty on the
[1:33:25] inside this sanctification is going to
[1:33:27] so clean this guy and Along Came
[1:33:31] sanctification have you believe in Santa
[1:33:32] case you do you believe a lie Bible you
[1:33:34] have to sure so still that's not it's a
[1:33:39] little more like that's two more words
[1:33:42] but then come to Pentecost the
[1:33:45] restoration of the gifts speaking in
[1:33:47] tongues they call it the initial
[1:33:48] evidence speaking in tongues there they
[1:33:49] call the initial evidence which brought
[1:33:51] forth the what the shuk but they
[1:33:53] denominated but when you I want you to
[1:33:57] make that personal you when you Bob
[1:34:01] black comes to say
[1:34:05] and my father are two now how close was
[1:34:14] how close was Jesus and his father he
[1:34:19] was the father made manifest in human
[1:34:22] flesh when you come to say I and my
[1:34:26] father are one and these other things
[1:34:29] like the I am we're talking about then
[1:34:32] the shuk pulls away because you know
[1:34:33] what you can set up stand up here and
[1:34:36] you don't need discernment when you
[1:34:37] start preaching and get it so close to
[1:34:38] where we say the I am where that we say
[1:34:40] we came from God we go back to God what
[1:34:43] we saying the Word was made flesh and
[1:34:45] dwelt among us and when we point it to
[1:34:47] not me myself person but to us as the
[1:34:49] bride it makes a lot of you nervous it
[1:34:53] made a lot of people in the Philippines
[1:34:54] nervous why they'd never seen it that
[1:34:56] close you either gonna see it that close
[1:34:58] or the shirts gonna pull away cuz look
[1:35:00] the shucks can't stand being because it
[1:35:03] is not the real brain I'm just telling
[1:35:08] you what brother Brennan said then the
[1:35:10] shucks pulls away from it what from the
[1:35:12] people that say I my father won and
[1:35:16] these other things but the real genuine
[1:35:20] bride Church will bring forth the entire
[1:35:24] Word of God in its fullness and in its
[1:35:28] strength for he's the same yesterday
[1:35:29] today and forever
[1:35:32] hey man let's go to number 10 and I'm
[1:35:42] gonna stop right there and I'll pick it
[1:35:43] up Sunday right here in birth pains that
[1:35:48] all right we'll be done right here
[1:35:49] musicians get ready to come notice
[1:35:52] quickly now this is in birth plans no
[1:35:53] notice quickly now she is in that stage
[1:35:56] beyond a shadow of a doubt where in the
[1:35:58] loudest in church age so beyond a shadow
[1:35:59] of a doubt we're still in the layout is
[1:36:01] injured yeah okay now we've been birthed
[1:36:03] out of the age but we're still it you
[1:36:04] got to go home in your layout and see a
[1:36:06] car you got to turn your layout see an
[1:36:07] air conditioner on and you got to turn
[1:36:09] you allowed to stay on Netflix we're
[1:36:11] right where's Lois when I need him now
[1:36:14] her messenger is promised I love it
[1:36:16] Malak on the 4th chapter so what's he
[1:36:18] doing he's identifying who what he's
[1:36:20] talking about because remember listen
[1:36:24] folks
[1:36:25] no disrespect God had to speak to
[1:36:28] brother Branham but we even when brother
[1:36:29] Branham was I was just reading it where
[1:36:31] he was baptizing 500 people that angel
[1:36:34] never said you would bring the second
[1:36:41] coming the crime in every quote he said
[1:36:46] the angel says your message will forerun
[1:36:49] the second coming of Christ your message
[1:36:53] sure it had to come through him but you
[1:36:55] and I are that message without that it's
[1:36:59] just one person you and I are that we're
[1:37:02] the recipient and the message is to
[1:37:06] bring back the word bring the people
[1:37:09] back to the word birth is to be she's to
[1:37:12] be delivered of a new birth don't look
[1:37:14] not a new birth to make it different
[1:37:18] you've still got to go through
[1:37:20] justifications thinking about sending
[1:37:21] Holy Ghost but there's no other people
[1:37:24] in the world have ever brought
[1:37:26] justification up to the part that
[1:37:29] brother Browne did nobody is brought
[1:37:31] sanctification up to the war part
[1:37:33] brother Brown talked about he nobody has
[1:37:36] ever opened that Seventh Seal and showed
[1:37:37] you that the Holy Ghost is going to
[1:37:40] change your body sure we read it in the
[1:37:44] Bible and we hear a prophecy but you are
[1:37:46] a recipient of that birth is to be she's
[1:37:49] to be delivered of a new birth from
[1:37:52] according to Malachi 4 in the church
[1:37:57] world today there's two systems working
[1:38:02] in the message church there's two
[1:38:04] systems working in the church world
[1:38:07] today there's two systems working now
[1:38:09] listen real close listen say it's not
[1:38:11] out there he's here he wants to disrupt
[1:38:14] this he don't want to disrupt that he
[1:38:16] wants to disrupt this so he gets the
[1:38:18] church before you do he's here when
[1:38:20] you're not and he leaves off you leave
[1:38:22] well actually he leaves with you now I
[1:38:25] want to see if you're going to say Amen
[1:38:27] on this okay there are two systems
[1:38:30] working
[1:38:30] the church world today I'm gonna get
[1:38:33] this off my shoulder I think I just did
[1:38:34] that and then I have it over with we all
[1:38:37] know that that's the Word of God and the
[1:38:39] denominational system there is the two
[1:38:42] systems at work just as they was Jacob
[1:38:44] and Esau one after the spirit the other
[1:38:47] after the flesh come in you got all that
[1:38:51] fleshly emotion and all that but you've
[1:38:53] got the people that love the Word of God
[1:38:55] and God anoints the word and then signs
[1:38:59] have to follow signs have to follow up
[1:39:02] believers believers don't follow signs
[1:39:05] I'm telling you no I told y'all a long
[1:39:08] time ago you just wait
[1:39:09] somebody's gonna raise up and have all
[1:39:14] kind of signs and wonders and people are
[1:39:17] gonna flock all afternoon like crazy and
[1:39:20] if you're not grounded in the word
[1:39:21] you'll go to because it ain't gonna
[1:39:24] matter what he says you just want to see
[1:39:25] the prayer lines and the healings and
[1:39:27] all back to what brother Branham did
[1:39:28] that's gone that's carnal reformed I
[1:39:30] read that to you a long time ago brother
[1:39:31] but I said that's not even supposed to
[1:39:32] be this way I read you the quote Paul
[1:39:36] says leaving the principle was the
[1:39:38] doctrine of Christ of laying on of hands
[1:39:39] and of baptism what go on to what
[1:39:44] perfection sure we're perfected in our
[1:39:48] soul y'all come on musicians come on but
[1:39:52] you and I are recipients of the whole
[1:39:55] book we're recipients of ever revelation
[1:39:58] every mystery that's my brother mom said
[1:40:00] them the mystery is now history why
[1:40:02] you're the mystery I thought if Christ
[1:40:06] was a mystery and if Christ is in you
[1:40:08] that makes you the mystery listen we're
[1:40:12] a mystery to the world I hope you're a
[1:40:16] mystery to the world it's like I told
[1:40:18] you about that brother this came and
[1:40:19] sitting down at our ministers meeting
[1:40:20] there in the Philippines he said I've
[1:40:22] never met a denomination like you well
[1:40:25] I'm glad he saw a difference I said
[1:40:29] we're nondenomination I said we believe
[1:40:31] you no we don't believe that we don't
[1:40:33] believe only our head ships Christ and
[1:40:37] I'll follow up on that because brother
[1:40:39] whales back in the Philippines now so
[1:40:41] maybe I'll follow up on him
[1:40:44] what happened with that brother so let's
[1:40:46] stand their feet god bless you the word
[1:40:51] is made flesh in your flesh the flesh of
[1:40:55] Jesus is not here but the flesh of Jesus
[1:41:00] is here in a multi-member D in the bride
[1:41:04] of Jesus Christ doesn't matter how old
[1:41:06] we get brother Kylie when hit like he
[1:41:07] first started coming here he he the
[1:41:09] young man and now he's still a young man
