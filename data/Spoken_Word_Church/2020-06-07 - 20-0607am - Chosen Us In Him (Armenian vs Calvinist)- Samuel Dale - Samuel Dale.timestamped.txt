[37:51] reading of the word
[37:52] now I want to try to
[37:55] it may run into a few
[37:58] services maybe we won't try to me but it
[38:01] may run into a few services on
[38:03] predestination I haven't decided totally
[38:06] which direction I'm going in but I want
[38:09] you to think about what is being said in
[38:13] the scriptures because that's the main
[38:16] thing you know take the scriptures and
[38:18] read them for yourself and see what is
[38:21] being said in those scriptures and and
[38:24] you know then that way you can can see
[38:28] things and and we read here in
[38:31] Ephesians it says we were chosen and
[38:34] that he chosen us in him
[38:37] will see we were we were like we've
[38:40] always been coming up to than the
[38:42] churches and I see we thought all of our
[38:45] life that we sought God we sought God
[38:47] come find out is God seeking us
[38:51] you said well I thought oh god that's
[38:53] what I want to do today I want to throw
[38:55] something out to you that's gonna go
[38:57] this way and then it's gonna go this way
[38:59] so now you're gonna have to pull them
[39:01] together
[39:02] alright see when you say well the Bible
[39:06] says no man salt God at any time
[39:09] you said what Brody Dalle I remember
[39:12] when when I cried and I prayed and I
[39:14] fasted and I've done a lot of things and
[39:18] in all and and I saw God for four years
[39:23] you know well now that's not meaning you
[39:28] didn't do that
[39:30] when the Bible says no man salt Gardena
[39:33] it doesn't mean that you did not go
[39:36] through them he's not denying that you
[39:39] cried you prayed you fasted you you've
[39:41] done everything you could do trying to
[39:44] find God
[39:45] because we know we did and and that's
[39:48] true but the point is to not put the
[39:51] emphasis upon that but you know of us
[39:56] trying to search for him or seeking out
[39:59] him
[40:01] he was seeking us
[40:04] did we look back and I won't I'll try
[40:06] not to read too much today but this get
[40:09] some thoughts to what I want you to
[40:10] think about a little bit see in the
[40:13] Garden of Eden when man fell
[40:15] it was not Adam running around hunting
[40:20] God
[40:21] it was Adam running around hiding from
[40:24] God
[40:25] right he got among the bushes and the
[40:28] things and he he was hiding it was God
[40:31] searching for Adam
[40:34] but if you were to ask Adam now Adam
[40:37] what you do well I realized there was
[40:41] something wrong guy and I I do it and in
[40:43] and out a little bit problems with you
[40:45] know facing God so I run in head but I
[40:48] really wanted God
[40:49] well that's the truth to that now that's
[40:53] the point I want you to think on
[40:55] listen to what I'm saying
[40:57] don't try to figure out what I'm saying
[41:01] listen to what I'm saying to where
[41:03] that'll come to the right point see the
[41:05] Bible's right no man saw God at any time
[41:07] the Bible says the goodness of God is
[41:11] what leads us to repentance
[41:14] so we say no we were repented and that
[41:17] brought God to us that didn't bring God
[41:19] to you to her for you to repent
[41:24] you say yeah I did he brought God I
[41:27] repented and he come to me no he was
[41:29] calling you the whole time
[41:31] see we'll get it all mixed up get it
[41:34] into the wrong point and then we can't
[41:36] do it see it wasn't you choosing God
[41:40] you said yes I did brother Dale now I
[41:43] chose God I remember what I done all
[41:46] right that's what I'm saying don't be so
[41:49] over
[41:51] when you call it don't don't run out the
[41:53] wrong end of the show on me and get the
[41:56] wrong idea see God chose you and I
[42:01] we didn't choose him we had nothing in
[42:05] us to choose him with
[42:08] right see now keep that in mind and
[42:12] you'll understand the point see you say
[42:15] but I did brother Dale I remember when
[42:17] the preacher preached the message you
[42:18] know and I prayed and I cried amen you
[42:21] done that
[42:22] no one is denying you the Bible's not
[42:26] denying the prophets not denying it when
[42:29] he would say no man salt God at any time
[42:31] the
[42:33] Bible is not lying when it says that but
[42:37] he's not saying that you didn't cry out
[42:40] and pray and search for him
[42:44] can you get that straight because that's
[42:47] that's the that's the part that seems to
[42:50] be
[42:51] confusing into the mind of man is car
[42:54] you say now you never saw God yes I did
[42:58] now it might not have been the rest of
[43:01] y'all
[43:03] but I saw God
[43:05] now I remember what I done
[43:08] oh
[43:09] yeah I can remember what I done I
[43:13] prayed and cried out to God for two
[43:16] years
[43:17] seeking the baptism with the Holy Ghost
[43:19] that was after I come in this message
[43:22] well see most people would say you come
[43:25] into the message that means you had to
[43:26] hold a ghost when I heard that prophet
[43:29] talking about the Holy Spirit in the way
[43:30] he talked about it I knew not real quick
[43:33] I didn't have what he's talking about
[43:35] but now how many people overrode that
[43:38] and said well you've got to have the
[43:41] Holy Ghost I've been told that by
[43:43] preachers you got to have it because you
[43:45] come to the message and
[43:47] a lot of you wonder about it doing it
[43:50] and the sisters other day said she tried
[43:52] it but for two years I studied this
[43:55] message and I forgot the whole world I
[43:59] have read six books in one day and
[44:01] listen to two tapes I
[44:04] just put my whole life
[44:06] sister the other day Cohen told me said
[44:09] I tried that what do you try it try
[44:12] studying that much my point or emphasis
[44:15] is one thing see you said what brother
[44:17] Dale you were seeking God well I thought
[44:20] I was
[44:21] well yet I could read what the Prophet
[44:24] said and the Bible that said that no man
[44:27] sought God at any time I just couldn't
[44:29] get it together
[44:31] all right now here's the emphasis I'm
[44:35] wanting to get
[44:36] see don't think that the Bible or
[44:39] anything is telling you that you didn't
[44:42] cry well I remember when I did are you
[44:43] telling me I didn't cry and pray for God
[44:46] no no no
[44:49] I'm telling you you did and I'm telling
[44:53] you that God honored those things
[44:56] he honored your prayers and your crying
[45:00] out to him and it brought God to us yes
[45:03] but that's not the point the point is
[45:07] something else calls us to come to that
[45:10] position to desire him go we didn't come
[45:13] into the world with a desire to serve
[45:15] God
[45:17] we come into the world with a desire to
[45:19] serve them the devil and he's doing and
[45:22] that's what we served right go we went
[45:26] after him and his wife all right but you
[45:30] see then something happened you heard
[45:33] your prophet say he said there's a
[45:35] little something different about you all
[45:37] the whole times and you know you
[45:39] remember that well I told you I'll fit
[45:42] it and I don't lie I was out in the
[45:46] world and sin and I'd come home at night
[45:49] I didn't I'd sit down and have a broken
[45:51] heart over the things that I had done
[45:56] most people don't say it that way did
[45:58] they come home happy about what they've
[46:01] been doing they had a good time doing I
[46:03] did and there was something different
[46:06] something was there that was dealing
[46:09] with me but I didn't choose him I
[46:14] wouldn't search him for God
[46:17] it was God searching for me now so you
[46:21] see what I'm saying I don't know where
[46:22] the right wording - you - but you see
[46:24] this two-sided is part of what you're
[46:26] looking at one side of you you were
[46:28] crying out for God you were longing for
[46:31] God you were searching for God you know
[46:33] fasting praying and I the other side of
[46:36] you was going the other way
[46:42] let's see then what is it then that
[46:45] caused you to do what you done well he
[46:48] God loved me
[46:51] you know God loved me now don't get that
[46:54] away I mean malece be honest enough to
[46:58] be sensible and straight don't get no
[47:00] good things in your your doing to think
[47:03] that God calls you because of your
[47:04] goodness
[47:08] that's what we're gonna finish up if I
[47:10] can by the end of the message I want to
[47:13] get into something that's what I said
[47:14] it's gonna go this way that way you
[47:16] gonna have to hold on because
[47:18] you know Paul and Peter
[47:24] we're both preaching the same time
[47:27] do you agree with that
[47:30] you agree that Paul went into the
[47:33] backside of the desert and came out
[47:34] preaching the same thing do you agree
[47:38] that the Prophet said that Paul and
[47:41] Peter had no difference in doctrine
[47:45] do you agree with that
[47:49] you have to because it's true
[47:54] but do you know and realize that
[47:58] mankind has always looked at Paul as
[48:01] being the Calvinist
[48:05] there in talking life now I've come
[48:09] laughing at him because he didn't know
[48:10] what I was gonna preach on today and we
[48:12] got into Calvinism and Arminianism you
[48:15] know but see people think Paul was a
[48:18] Calvinist in that it was okay for this
[48:21] okay for that God chose me and it
[48:23] doesn't make no difference I'm a
[48:24] Christian and
[48:26] they thanked James I said Peter I'm in J
[48:30] James
[48:32] instead of James that he was a legalist
[48:36] an Armenian
[48:39] dealing in his what he doing and didn't
[48:43] do
[48:44] but you know what
[48:47] now you gonna catch on if you listen you
[48:50] know that Paul and James were both
[48:53] teaching the same thing
[49:00] there was no difference in their
[49:02] doctrine
[49:03] yeah Apollo them dumping now see that's
[49:06] what you're reading
[49:08] you're reading what you mankind was
[49:11] reading what Paul said and mankind put
[49:15] it to saying Paul was saying one thing
[49:17] and James was saying another thing
[49:21] when they were saying the same thing
[49:24] it was the way they were saying it
[49:32] I'll give them to you if you want he
[49:34] said we've got to bring it to the middle
[49:40] yeah but brother Dale
[49:43] Paul was looking at it by faith
[49:48] James was looking at it this works that
[49:50] we do
[49:51] they were both right
[49:57] they were both in the Word of God
[50:01] the new Brennan said Calvinism is right
[50:04] as long as it's learning the Bible
[50:06] Arminianism is right as long as it's in
[50:09] the Bible
[50:11] that doesn't mean everything we think
[50:14] about it is right that doesn't make it
[50:17] right to say well are you a Calvinist
[50:20] Armenia are you an Armenian I'm both
[50:25] because I've got it in the middle of the
[50:27] road to understand
[50:31] what these men were doing now you know
[50:33] the story you've listened to on it where
[50:35] brother Branham said James was what man
[50:38] looked at in the works
[50:41] he said Paul
[50:44] was in the basis of what God was looking
[50:47] at well you know what both of them drive
[50:50] so what I said it's gonna be an odd
[50:52] service and you're gonna think and
[50:55] you're gonna think man I don't know what
[50:56] in the world that men talking about
[50:58] well hang on long enough maybe you'll
[51:01] get to the point you'll see what I'm
[51:02] talking about it
[51:05] because answer me the question
[51:09] what was it what was the good thing that
[51:12] made God choose you
[51:21] you think of any good thing that you've
[51:22] done that made God choose you
[51:26] know I can think of a lot of that that
[51:29] he had ever justifiable reason
[51:33] did not like me at all
[51:36] right
[51:40] but for some reason
[51:44] they now stone says what don't don't
[51:47] there's no reasoning in anything that
[51:49] you could think of to cause God to come
[51:53] to you and save you or anything yeah but
[51:55] I believed him
[51:57] the Bible said the devil believed and
[52:00] trembled about what he believed no
[52:04] I'm sorry that's where I talk
[52:07] but it's the truth right
[52:10] see we want to put it on something that
[52:13] we done or something we didn't do
[52:17] all right now if you're gonna put it on
[52:19] something you've done or didn't do
[52:20] you're either an Armenian or a Calvinist
[52:28] you're admitting what you're admitting
[52:31] you're one of the other you're either
[52:32] Armenian if you're doing it on works if
[52:35] it was something that I'd done that
[52:37] caused God to come down and save me
[52:41] then that's Arminianism
[52:44] the Calvinism as to the point where God
[52:47] saved me don't make no difference what I
[52:49] do cuz he loved me so much
[53:00] but think about it now
[53:03] and you'll see the secret is in the
[53:06] scriptures that holds the key because
[53:09] we've got to be brought to the middle of
[53:11] the situation
[53:16] we've got to come to the basis of seeing
[53:18] the Calvinism now listen Paul was not a
[53:23] Calvinist
[53:27] James was not an Armenian
[53:33] they were born-again Christians who had
[53:37] the Word of God lined up correctly
[53:46] see what man done man took what Paul
[53:50] said and called him a Calvinist
[53:56] man took what James said and called him
[53:59] an Armenian Alika list but he wasn't
[54:05] seen there you're gonna make the Prophet
[54:07] lie because the Prophet says Peter and
[54:11] says James and Paul had no difference in
[54:14] doctrine
[54:19] well there was this for now come on now
[54:22] don't try to play games with me I don't
[54:24] I won't play with you
[54:26] if be honest within your own self
[54:30] there's not a person sitting in here
[54:33] that have salvation today that didn't
[54:36] think of one time or another a little
[54:38] bit about Arminianism or Calvinism
[54:41] in other words you thinking well God
[54:44] saved me because that that I loved him
[54:47] all right
[54:49] you're a Calvinist
[54:51] or he saved me because I didn't live
[54:54] like brother Dale I
[54:56] lived a good life
[54:58] now you're Armenian
[55:04] what you see I
[55:07] take the statement of what it just said
[55:09] and show you that there is a truth to
[55:13] Calvinistic teaching
[55:18] there's a truth of the Armenian teaching
[55:21] of it
[55:25] just don't take what man says about it
[55:30] over other Schrader I remember him years
[55:33] ago telling it he said he listened to a
[55:35] man explaining Arminianism and he
[55:37] thought man he's got it he knows what
[55:41] are you talking about boys got a right
[55:43] to the tape he said he turned over and
[55:45] took another message for somebody else
[55:47] and listened and that man was a
[55:48] Calvinist and he said no man I'm
[55:51] confused code I don't know which one of
[55:53] them's right and I'm sure I messed up
[55:58] but now listen now you can like this
[56:01] lump it do what you want to paint a
[56:04] person in this building and it doesn't
[56:06] didn't have to begin with some little
[56:09] thing that
[56:10] you thought was the reason God saves you
[56:14] you tell me that um they say hey you
[56:17] lied and I didn't
[56:21] and then you'll take brother Browns
[56:23] message see to try to back up what
[56:26] you're talking about
[56:29] and when you do you make him a Calvinist
[56:33] or an Armenian
[56:36] but random wouldn't either one
[56:40] we get he was a human being
[56:46] he'll tell you over and over no man
[56:48] thought God but he'll tell you all the
[56:50] time about he cried in the woods head
[56:52] and how he done this and how he done
[56:54] that and how he prayed out and how
[56:56] you've done all of these things trying
[56:58] to seek God for some answer to what him
[57:01] to do it
[57:04] cuz of a human being
[57:07] he's got I don't I don't brother - he
[57:11] you telling me I was a legalist at one
[57:13] time ever born to getting believer I'll
[57:16] say this and not back up what the code
[57:18] has been in my life is in your life it's
[57:20] all ever born again believer starts off
[57:23] their journey as a baby right you know
[57:26] what a baby is a
[57:27] legalist
[57:33] best way to put it legalist
[57:36] why because he thinks he's done
[57:39] something or didn't do something
[57:45] yeah I'm trying to find an answer to
[57:47] what that Paul said
[57:51] when he said where he's chosen us in him
[57:59] we didn't choose him
[58:02] he chose us in him him who
[58:05] who's the him
[58:12] come on are you reading
[58:19] blessed be the God and father of our
[58:21] Lord Jesus Christ
[58:25] that's a blessed us with all spiritual
[58:28] blessings in heavenly places in Christ
[58:34] according as he had chosen us in him who
[58:40] in Christ
[58:43] right
[58:45] when
[58:47] before the foundation of the world that
[58:50] we should be holy and without blame
[58:52] before him in love
[58:53] see we want to go to the predestination
[58:56] we want to get to the pre determining
[58:59] factors and things of predestination and
[59:02] we want to get some kind of a line
[59:05] in our thoughts
[59:09] but you're going to have to get one
[59:11] thing straight who done the choosing
[59:14] and who was it doing the choosing it
[59:17] certainly wouldn't a father that chose
[59:20] us in the son
[59:22] we're not Trinitarians
[59:30] see you never chose him
[59:33] the Bible finally tells you did
[59:36] he chose you
[59:39] will brother Taylor call all that but
[59:42] but they had to be something
[59:49] we'll get on predestination maybe we'll
[59:51] find out what that is
[59:56] but how does God choose
[1:00:00] he doesn't choose by your good works
[1:00:09] as a matter of fact it seems to be
[1:00:12] opposite
[1:00:20] it seems to be the basis that he loves
[1:00:24] those who had no reason whatsoever to
[1:00:28] love him
[1:00:31] come on
[1:00:33] are you listening
[1:00:36] do you have any reason for him saving
[1:00:39] you
[1:00:44] do you have any justifiable point of the
[1:00:48] word that he would choose you
[1:00:53] to see he didn't choose you
[1:00:59] you say he did go flip flop see he did
[1:01:03] he shouted no he chose you in Jesus
[1:01:07] Christ
[1:01:08] he never chose you
[1:01:11] let's get that one thing straight he
[1:01:14] didn't choose us in the basis you said
[1:01:16] wouldn't you just said to start with
[1:01:17] that God shows up right but he showed us
[1:01:20] in Jesus Christ
[1:01:21] there was more to the story I told you
[1:01:24] how to hang on and listen
[1:01:33] see because we could say all day long
[1:01:36] when the scripture that says the gifts
[1:01:37] and callings of God
[1:01:39] listen Colleen of God is without
[1:01:42] repentance
[1:01:48] when I repented everything the Bible
[1:01:51] says the goodness of God
[1:01:54] is what leads you to repentance
[1:02:01] brother Branham I was looking there's
[1:02:03] ice night in this morning on he said if
[1:02:05] we can just get these things straight
[1:02:06] would be the happiest people
[1:02:09] to realize what the whole story is
[1:02:17] see we want to run the story like we
[1:02:19] wanna run as I said about Arminianism
[1:02:21] and Calvinism
[1:02:28] Paul was not a
[1:02:31] Calvinist
[1:02:34] James was not an Armenian it was a
[1:02:39] born-again Christian
[1:02:44] but run said they had no difference in
[1:02:47] doctrine not one iota between James and
[1:02:51] Paul in the doctrine
[1:03:03] Arminianism is right
[1:03:05] if it's in the word
[1:03:09] works is faith expressed
[1:03:14] right
[1:03:17] that's why pop James would say show me
[1:03:21] your faith without your works and I'll
[1:03:23] show you my faith by my work
[1:03:28] what do you think Paul wasn't living a
[1:03:31] Christian life and that he was beaten
[1:03:34] James to death about the way he thinks
[1:03:36] thought it was doing no Paul and James
[1:03:38] was both right
[1:03:46] they both had the truth
[1:03:53] pull it together in the middle of the
[1:03:55] road and you'll see Arminianism is in
[1:03:58] the Word of God because we're supposed
[1:04:00] to live a Christian life
[1:04:04] we're supposed to be good people not
[1:04:07] because we have to
[1:04:11] we're supposed to because of the love of
[1:04:13] God that has saved us from the things of
[1:04:16] the world
[1:04:26] the Calvinism is okay as long as it's
[1:04:28] into Word
[1:04:31] because our lives prove what we are
[1:04:40] what is it just what the scripture says
[1:04:42] every which one we yield our members to
[1:04:48] you understand
[1:04:53] see it's not you choosing when we get
[1:04:57] into the predestination leave that out
[1:04:59] of your predestination it's not you
[1:05:01] choosing
[1:05:02] okay now flop it back but there's one
[1:05:05] thing about it if you didn't choose you
[1:05:08] ain't gonna get saved
[1:05:14] right if you didn't choose you're not
[1:05:17] gonna be saved because God is not gonna
[1:05:19] override your free moral agency and make
[1:05:21] you get saved
[1:05:23] no no way
[1:05:26] you ain't gonna make you be saved
[1:05:30] he might make you wish you had
[1:05:33] but you didn't go to Mikey
[1:05:37] because he leaves it into your hand is a
[1:05:40] free moral agent to accept or reject
[1:05:47] just remember one thing I
[1:05:51] hope this was well deep enough in there
[1:05:53] because according to what we read he's
[1:05:56] chosen us in him before the foundation
[1:06:00] of the world when
[1:06:04] did he choose you before the foundation
[1:06:07] of the world
[1:06:09] we don't want
[1:06:11] if that's right brother Louise
[1:06:14] that he chose me before the foundation
[1:06:16] world then I don't do it
[1:06:20] because I wasn't before the foundation
[1:06:23] of the world
[1:06:29] he wasn't back there before the
[1:06:31] foundation of the world and some form of
[1:06:33] a human being or a part or something or
[1:06:35] some kind of a nature I mean a ways or
[1:06:38] whatever no
[1:06:40] maybe
[1:06:45] it can't be us having anything to do
[1:06:50] with it so it's put back before the
[1:06:52] world
[1:06:54] it's where he was that when he done the
[1:06:56] choosing
[1:06:59] now you're not Armenian are Calvinists
[1:07:05] your born-again christian trying to live
[1:07:08] the life of christ because of what he
[1:07:10] has done for us
[1:07:16] sure we can go through the whole story
[1:07:19] we could go through the pre destinations
[1:07:21] with a even reading the Prophet were
[1:07:23] that God looked down through time and
[1:07:25] saw what you would do and no Jew would
[1:07:28] choose this and all and he had
[1:07:29] everything exactly right in line for you
[1:07:32] to receive it amen
[1:07:37] but you didn't do it
[1:07:41] that's the whole story
[1:07:46] we were chosen in Jesus Christ before
[1:07:49] the foundation world so it's not whether
[1:07:51] or not I was chosen
[1:07:53] that ain't the key it ain't the key of
[1:07:56] me being chosen the key was whether or
[1:07:59] not he was chosen
[1:08:02] we know for certain he was accepted
[1:08:07] we have that in the right line that he
[1:08:09] was accepted
[1:08:12] then he just applied that we'll get back
[1:08:14] to those words later he just applied
[1:08:17] that to you and I in our Christian
[1:08:20] journey
[1:08:25] what are you following Lee if there was
[1:08:29] any part of Armenian ISM and Calvinism
[1:08:31] all right food either part without
[1:08:33] bringing it to the correct order I'm a
[1:08:34] point of the middle then you're you're
[1:08:38] you losing your own case because see you
[1:08:41] you if you're in our meaning or
[1:08:43] Calvinism it means you doing something
[1:08:44] here
[1:08:47] are you following me
[1:08:49] Armenian Calvinism whatever whether you
[1:08:52] talk about it being your works whether
[1:08:53] you talk about your goodness and
[1:08:54] whatever you're still making it to be
[1:08:56] here it was not here when he made the
[1:08:59] choice
[1:09:00] he didn't make the choice I do you got
[1:09:03] here
[1:09:06] he chose before we got here
[1:09:11] what he said to Jeremiah
[1:09:14] but I know Dean before you while you
[1:09:17] were in your mother's wound
[1:09:20] he didn't say Jeremiah now this what we
[1:09:23] want to talk about we want to make it
[1:09:24] some Calvin is we will say now Jeremiah
[1:09:26] what it was your mouths up in the mind
[1:09:28] Oh God
[1:09:29] be careful
[1:09:33] be careful how far you go into mind
[1:09:42] what about predestinate in your own self
[1:09:45] out of existence
[1:09:48] well you're crazy
[1:09:52] about it
[1:09:56] do you believe that his name was Ella
[1:09:59] him
[1:09:59] that we tried to go through you know the
[1:10:02] hello him being the self existing or
[1:10:05] existing alone
[1:10:08] come on now I'm quoting brother Adam he
[1:10:11] said we wasn't back there he said the
[1:10:13] only thing we was was in God's mind
[1:10:16] not that we were back there only in
[1:10:19] God's mind
[1:10:22] all right
[1:10:26] see we make our choice
[1:10:29] we make our
[1:10:32] parts being here in life
[1:10:35] and not realizing God was already before
[1:10:39] the world of a god he knew the whole
[1:10:41] thing before if not then he's not God
[1:10:47] he didn't have to wait till we got here
[1:10:49] to choose
[1:10:50] he didn't have to wait till we got here
[1:10:53] to find out whether we'd be good or not
[1:10:54] her except him
[1:10:58] that's my brother's idea of Methodist
[1:11:01] minister his idea is that
[1:11:04] God just got fed up with all of the
[1:11:07] things he tried to save mankind behind
[1:11:09] he could never save nobody so he turned
[1:11:11] around and
[1:11:12] just said I'm gonna do it and he done it
[1:11:16] before we ever even got started that's
[1:11:19] what it sounds like but
[1:11:23] just remember
[1:11:26] whatever you do just
[1:11:31] don't go back too far
[1:11:36] how about predestinated yourself out of
[1:11:39] existence
[1:11:43] you're crazy
[1:11:49] now it's back there I can remember it
[1:11:54] yeah so does old poll to Napoleon you
[1:11:56] know that had he stuck his hand the
[1:11:58] thing the shirt or whatever he done
[1:11:59] claimed you know
[1:12:03] how far back darker you want to go
[1:12:05] because if you go too far you
[1:12:07] predestinate your self out of existence
[1:12:13] if you go back to her he self-existing
[1:12:19] then he's got to be existing along then
[1:12:21] there's no way you'll go back there
[1:12:27] is that simple
[1:12:31] would you know what that takes
[1:12:34] it takes a little bit of Calvinism and
[1:12:38] a little bit of arminianism and brings
[1:12:42] it together in the middle of the road
[1:12:46] and says
[1:12:49] we were chosen in him not now listen it
[1:12:56] didn't say we were chosen of him
[1:13:00] and when you flop it into your Calvinist
[1:13:06] we were chosen in him
[1:13:15] then I can walk through life and and
[1:13:17] realize one thing for certain
[1:13:20] somebody else is running the show
[1:13:24] it's not what I've done or didn't do
[1:13:27] that saved me nor kept me from being
[1:13:30] saved
[1:13:37] could you see your flopping on one side
[1:13:39] of the other
[1:13:43] he
[1:13:45] [Music]
[1:13:46] never accepted you because of your
[1:13:49] goodness
[1:13:51] he accepted you because of his goodness
[1:13:59] he chose Abraham
[1:14:03] and I like the way that brethren said it
[1:14:05] about Abraham he said he chose Abraham
[1:14:08] and he said cause he knew Abraham was
[1:14:10] teaching his children I
[1:14:12] like that
[1:14:16] you realize that's your life that you're
[1:14:18] living has something to do once you are
[1:14:21] okay now we're flopping I mean in Islam
[1:14:24] Calvinism huh got hold it in the middle
[1:14:27] of the road
[1:14:30] he chose us that puts it right down the
[1:14:33] middle of the road
[1:14:37] but I must accept what he has done for
[1:14:40] me
[1:14:43] before he can make that applied to me
[1:14:50] but already before the world he saw the
[1:14:53] what he was going to do
[1:14:57] but just remember
[1:15:00] it's got to be a finished work on earth
[1:15:08] before the world God existed alone you
[1:15:12] agree
[1:15:14] self-existing
[1:15:16] all right the only thing could be back
[1:15:19] there would be in his mind not a bunch
[1:15:22] of people we're not little bitty
[1:15:24] identities or something that was running
[1:15:26] around in God you know before the world
[1:15:29] waiting on a chance to get here
[1:15:33] we're in his mind
[1:15:36] but what he knew would take place when
[1:15:39] we got here
[1:15:42] sure it's what I said you've got to
[1:15:46] balance the story out you got to balance
[1:15:47] it out to the basis of one thing you
[1:15:51] cried you prayed you saw God youyou went
[1:15:54] out for days months weeks years whatever
[1:15:57] seeking after God crying out and praying
[1:16:01] and
[1:16:04] God says you never sought me
[1:16:11] now what's it gonna tell us you see but
[1:16:16] I but God now you know what I done
[1:16:19] he's in Yale but said I know what caused
[1:16:21] you to do that
[1:16:23] it was my goodness
[1:16:26] that caused you to cry out for
[1:16:28] repentance
[1:16:32] that's what got me out I'm sorry I'm not
[1:16:35] against any Church any people anything
[1:16:37] I've never been it's not it's not a
[1:16:39] place here to pick on other churches and
[1:16:41] what happens to the rest of the world
[1:16:43] and not other churches it's none of my
[1:16:45] business I have nothing to do what they
[1:16:47] do over in that church I have nothing to
[1:16:49] do with anywhere in this makes it I'm in
[1:16:51] this mess I'm in this church here and I
[1:16:53] preach to here
[1:16:54] let's see I try to get you to see
[1:16:58] what the truth of it is
[1:17:03] see then to realize that our minion ism
[1:17:06] is in the word
[1:17:08] well order want to live right
[1:17:12] Calvinism is in the world we love God
[1:17:16] and what he has done for us
[1:17:20] when he never shows from neither side
[1:17:24] because he was not an Armenian or
[1:17:26] neither was he Calvinists he was
[1:17:29] Almighty God I
[1:17:36] thought we believed
[1:17:39] what is the new birth brother branham
[1:17:41] cross mister of God reveal about page 45
[1:17:44] I guess what is the new birth
[1:17:47] he said it's a revelation of Jesus
[1:17:49] Christ
[1:17:50] personally to you
[1:17:54] now what your pastor says not what the
[1:17:57] preacher said no what mama said what
[1:17:59] daddy said what anybody said anything
[1:18:00] it's a revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:18:02] personally you a revelation
[1:18:05] revelation is faith
[1:18:09] it's been revealed to you what happened
[1:18:16] you understand
[1:18:20] see then you realize that I was the
[1:18:22] whole time I thought I was doing what
[1:18:25] was right I thought I was crying out
[1:18:26] before God and heaven help don't ever
[1:18:29] think that I'm telling you not to cry
[1:18:30] out
[1:18:35] don't think that I'm trying to tell you
[1:18:38] see we could old babies had one in there
[1:18:40] that was there was went back so far they
[1:18:43] wouldn't even have a revival
[1:18:46] never heard about that there were the
[1:18:48] people in the Baptist and especially the
[1:18:50] free wheels and independence won't buy
[1:18:52] they wouldn't even have a revival you
[1:18:54] know what
[1:18:55] because they're afraid their kids might
[1:18:57] get saved when God didn't want to save
[1:18:59] them
[1:19:00] you say that's stupid that's what they
[1:19:04] believed
[1:19:06] that's how far they had it twisted
[1:19:09] between Arminianism and Calvinism
[1:19:12] the truth and none truth
[1:19:16] that you wouldn't have a revival
[1:19:21] see we know that's not true but that's
[1:19:24] what people have based it on
[1:19:30] see the only thing I can base it on is
[1:19:32] what the scripture says that
[1:19:36] he chose me yeah all
[1:19:40] I do is accept a gift
[1:19:45] what is the gift of God eternal life
[1:19:47] through Jesus Christ
[1:19:55] see if you ever do see it correctly you
[1:19:57] realize what your father was doing
[1:20:05] then you'll realize what your profit is
[1:20:07] talking about
[1:20:09] have you ever walked
[1:20:13] knowing you by yourself
[1:20:16] knowing there's nobody around anywhere
[1:20:19] and you're just walking along
[1:20:23] and all at once it's just the presence
[1:20:25] comes
[1:20:28] that just
[1:20:31] you you just begin a little bit of
[1:20:34] feeling it and then it gradually gets
[1:20:37] more and over more and more
[1:20:39] until it just engulfs you
[1:20:42] you realize there's something
[1:20:44] supernatural
[1:20:47] right there
[1:20:57] flip-flop
[1:20:58] say one time say another thing bring it
[1:21:01] together in the middle
[1:21:03] you realize now listen listen everybody
[1:21:06] whip women you realize that sometimes
[1:21:09] you pray too much
[1:21:10] no no wait a minute now brother brother
[1:21:13] brother dad I got one save it come on I
[1:21:15] don't do I'll call it for you the run
[1:21:19] said wins there's one thing we don't do
[1:21:20] we don't pray enough you ain't listening
[1:21:22] what I'm talking about
[1:21:25] you know that prior sometimes means sat
[1:21:28] down shut up and listen I want to talk
[1:21:31] to you
[1:21:35] right
[1:21:37] sometimes we're running our mouths when
[1:21:40] we ought to be sitting listening you
[1:21:42] ever pray and just stop for a moment in
[1:21:44] pause and say Lord is there anything
[1:21:49] anything you'd like to tell me or
[1:21:51] anything I need to do and what's going
[1:21:53] home
[1:21:56] see we pour out our prayers to him as
[1:21:59] our needs and things and and wondering
[1:22:02] why in the world he'd get in this
[1:22:03] satisfied and come you know come forth
[1:22:05] and do them
[1:22:08] sometimes we maybe need to just say lord
[1:22:12] help me
[1:22:16] and just come on the same Lord
[1:22:21] let me just shut up and listen
[1:22:27] let me listen to you
[1:22:32] D backwards and forth the
[1:22:35] middle-of-the-road
[1:22:39] prophet says we pray we don't pray
[1:22:42] enough then I say we pray too much brain
[1:22:45] to the middle of the road of what
[1:22:48] sometimes just shut up and listen
[1:22:51] just sit there for a little while and
[1:22:54] meditate
[1:22:58] you might find he can give you a lot of
[1:23:00] answers
[1:23:03] that's the middle of Road that's what
[1:23:05] I'm trying to get you to see between
[1:23:07] Arminianism in Calvinism there's a
[1:23:09] middle of the road that both of them are
[1:23:10] saying the same thing now I keep
[1:23:12] repeating it over and over Paul was not
[1:23:14] a Calvinist mankind took what Paul done
[1:23:18] and said and called him a Calvinist he
[1:23:22] was not a Calvinist he was a born-again
[1:23:24] Christian he knew exactly what Peter was
[1:23:26] talking about and Peter knew exactly
[1:23:28] what Paul was talking about can you go
[1:23:31] with me
[1:23:32] can you go with me on that if it riff if
[1:23:35] it's not true then you got one I'm
[1:23:38] saying something the other didn't agree
[1:23:39] with and you got brother branham wrong
[1:23:41] when blood runs said they both said the
[1:23:43] same thing
[1:23:47] he said there was no difference in their
[1:23:49] doctrine he said only their actions or
[1:23:52] character you know do it
[1:23:57] sure Paul was in the hook-nosed you you
[1:24:00] know we're talking like that lies not in
[1:24:01] the Bible study a little brother brother
[1:24:04] said he was to hook-nosed do
[1:24:06] you know what he was pretty Stern
[1:24:10] he's pretty Stern he told what was never
[1:24:14] dim yet which one it was with either
[1:24:15] John Mark or one of them you know Paul
[1:24:17] Jones and get out of here I don't want
[1:24:19] him to do do you leave me alone yet you
[1:24:21] go your way and I'm going my way you
[1:24:23] remember that I just put in my words
[1:24:26] okay
[1:24:27] one of those guys there was two of them
[1:24:30] on different occasions and one of them
[1:24:31] he never did reconcile back as far as
[1:24:33] it's telling you know to come back
[1:24:35] together and be with the other one rotor
[1:24:37] run said and the Bible says it Paul said
[1:24:40] tell bleed he said tell mark he said
[1:24:43] tell mark to come with you he said
[1:24:44] because he's a very needful
[1:24:46] don't you think maybe Paul and kind of
[1:24:48] got a little arrogant
[1:24:51] maybe in his thinking and then when he
[1:24:53] could thought it all over he thought
[1:24:56] well you know mark was right
[1:24:57] maybe man him needs to get back together
[1:25:00] and they did
[1:25:04] we were talking about life night you
[1:25:06] know that you you are you know I wasn't
[1:25:10] Rachel where is he you know you like
[1:25:12] them but you don't love them you know
[1:25:15] that's just kind of the way things are
[1:25:17] you lock on but you don't you know the
[1:25:20] actions of some people some people you
[1:25:22] don't like to be right on right so does
[1:25:24] their actions reaction but it's not the
[1:25:26] fact that you don't love them you love
[1:25:29] them you know but you just don't like
[1:25:31] the way their actions are
[1:25:33] mmm but that's fine with all of it but
[1:25:36] not listen let me get this and we'll get
[1:25:37] through
[1:25:40] so
[1:25:42] how does God predestinate
[1:25:46] that he doesn't run aground and that
[1:25:50] though how does it say it in the
[1:25:52] scripture that the Thames form can't say
[1:25:55] why did you make me this way they all
[1:25:59] right so you can't do that you can't go
[1:26:02] to God and said you made me wrong my
[1:26:04] brother's ministers Methodist minister
[1:26:05] he says that God made me the way I am
[1:26:07] and said he can't condemn me for being a
[1:26:09] sinner
[1:26:10] he said he made me one I said he didn't
[1:26:13] make you a sinner how would you like to
[1:26:15] sit under a good old Methodist minister
[1:26:17] preaching that
[1:26:18] he said something one day and I said
[1:26:20] there's one thing for certain him old
[1:26:23] Methodist would have put you out the
[1:26:25] door I said to her your belief and thing
[1:26:28] was he says God made me the way I think
[1:26:31] he didn't make you that way I
[1:26:33] said you made your own choice
[1:26:36] you went into sin with your own choice
[1:26:39] God never made you a sinner
[1:26:41] what's the according to him he made me
[1:26:43] Center so he can be
[1:26:46] my pouring what you got Calvinist you
[1:26:49] got Arminianism
[1:26:50] but in the middle you got a truth
[1:26:55] both of them are telling truth
[1:26:58] but not the truth
[1:27:01] truth is wonderful but I won't be truth
[1:27:03] I like to wait it under way the truth
[1:27:07] and the life I won't the truth I
[1:27:11] want something that I can sit down and
[1:27:14] think over and I don't have to throw it
[1:27:16] away or wonder what it is I
[1:27:20] believe in good works I
[1:27:24] believe we ought to be Christians
[1:27:29] but I also believe that God saved me
[1:27:33] no one made it I do like order to do
[1:27:36] he knows what you gonna follow him a lot
[1:27:41] but he knows too if he ever nails you
[1:27:43] down on your hot little you get
[1:27:45] running back you understand you'll come
[1:27:48] running by you know you won't get ride
[1:27:50] and get straightened up you know cuz he
[1:27:51] knows how to do that he's a good daddy
[1:27:56] he knows how to spank us sometimes and
[1:27:58] take urethanes
[1:28:00] but listen you following the story
[1:28:05] the Bible says in first Peter wanted to
[1:28:08] that we're elect according to
[1:28:11] foreknowledge
[1:28:14] well that's it right there we're over
[1:28:16] four dollars and we're elect according
[1:28:17] to foreknowledge his foreknowledge knew
[1:28:19] exactly what I did
[1:28:21] that's good
[1:28:25] the predestinate spies foreknowledge
[1:28:28] those who he foreknew he did
[1:28:30] predestinate
[1:28:35] but remember his predestination and his
[1:28:40] pre determining factor of anything you
[1:28:42] want to try to make it or something in
[1:28:43] it you better be careful where you place
[1:28:45] it because he's before the foundation of
[1:28:47] the world in his foreknowledge
[1:28:54] come on are you following that he was
[1:28:56] before the foundation the world in his
[1:28:58] foreknowledge
[1:29:01] those he foreknew he did predestinate
[1:29:06] not those that was backg are setting the
[1:29:09] side of him and and they come down but
[1:29:11] yet
[1:29:12] we're human beings not as souls not as
[1:29:16] being one but God before the world knew
[1:29:20] what he was going to do
[1:29:27] trying to explain salvation
[1:29:29] salvation of one thing did we choose him
[1:29:33] no he chose us
[1:29:38] did we accept him no he accepted us
[1:29:45] was not whether or not I what I do or
[1:29:48] have done or didn't do it's what he does
[1:29:57] it's what he does what he's he knows
[1:30:02] then you can go back into his mind and
[1:30:05] go back to a place of pre existence
[1:30:08] we'll get into that on predestination
[1:30:11] cuz if you're going in predestination
[1:30:12] you got to go back to pre existence
[1:30:18] because you got to have something
[1:30:19] predetermined from all right we'll get
[1:30:22] into those things try to bring out a few
[1:30:24] points but the main point of what I want
[1:30:26] you to see today is one thing it wasn't
[1:30:28] that we chose him he chose us
[1:30:36] it's whether or not he was chosen
[1:30:40] we know he was
[1:30:43] because he was the chooser
[1:30:45] he was the one that wrote all the rest
[1:30:48] of the book he's the one that said my
[1:30:52] goodness of brandy Dirr repentance
[1:30:56] he was the one that wrote the gifts and
[1:30:59] calling of God are without repentance
[1:31:03] he never repented to get a gift
[1:31:15] follow me
[1:31:16] he predestinate spy his foreknowledge
[1:31:23] he chooses
[1:31:25] by his election
[1:31:29] so then the scripture says make your
[1:31:31] calling and election sure I
[1:31:38] want to rest in the basis of what I know
[1:31:40] he's done not in the basis what I did or
[1:31:43] didn't do
[1:31:45] so you could stand up and tell me all
[1:31:47] the days or I could tell you and I could
[1:31:49] say well listen it's it's you know I've
[1:31:52] done this and I've done that you didn't
[1:31:53] I remember brother Colley he got onto me
[1:31:56] one time years ago and and
[1:31:59] you know because I'd said something and
[1:32:03] I said well you know I'm the chiefest of
[1:32:06] sinners
[1:32:08] well he was defending me as a brother he
[1:32:11] said brother they'll don't understand I
[1:32:12] knew what he meant because he knew in my
[1:32:14] life of what I'm doing it was I don't
[1:32:16] say I didn't do this I didn't do that I
[1:32:18] didn't do that I didn't drink I didn't
[1:32:19] smoke I didn't do this there's things I
[1:32:21] can say I didn't do and his point was
[1:32:23] hey we've done all of these things
[1:32:25] brother Dale didn't do any of these
[1:32:26] things so how can he be chiefest of
[1:32:28] sinners
[1:32:28] that's what Paul said
[1:32:31] Paul was the chiefest of sinners how
[1:32:34] because he was a closest to the truth
[1:32:40] Paul was a Calvinistic Armenian
[1:32:46] he had it together in the middle of the
[1:32:49] road he knew what Calvinism was he knew
[1:32:52] what our median is and was
[1:32:59] we'll find out one of these days it's
[1:33:01] not what we do or don't do is what he
[1:33:05] says
[1:33:12] Romans 11:29
[1:33:18] without repentance
[1:33:23] chosen us in him
[1:33:25] not by him but in him
[1:33:30] well see then I'm not concerned
[1:33:33] whether I'm gonna fail I know I'm gonna
[1:33:37] fail
[1:33:38] no problem I know I'm gonna fail
[1:33:42] I've done that right up front I know I'm
[1:33:44] gonna fail well brother there you gonna
[1:33:46] go out and do right no ain't gonna go
[1:33:47] out and deliberately do wrong no no we
[1:33:49] talked about that there's those things
[1:33:51] that we get back to telling the truth we
[1:33:52] know we're gonna do it but we know we
[1:33:54] don't have to do it we can get by
[1:33:57] without having to do it
[1:34:00] it's like I've always said come on use
[1:34:02] it I've always said this much I don't
[1:34:06] blame the devil for everything and I did
[1:34:10] well I don't devil he just I don't blame
[1:34:13] him for everything I do I do it myself
[1:34:17] I'm the one that's guilty of doing it
[1:34:19] it's not the devil sure he leads me and
[1:34:23] guide me and pushes me now but yet
[1:34:26] listen
[1:34:30] it's Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:34:35] if there's anything whatsoever that you
[1:34:38] and I should consider it's the fact that
[1:34:40] we should be happy that God did choose
[1:34:46] don't you think about that
[1:34:49] good away from all of our goodnesses we
[1:34:51] thought the reason of him doing it and
[1:34:53] get out of the basis that we know he did
[1:34:57] come on I'm glass for raising hands on
[1:35:00] this asset like this Hemi has the
[1:35:01] baptism of the Holy Ghost you know what
[1:35:03] if you do God chose you I slump that's a
[1:35:08] great thing he chose me
[1:35:14] all I done was just said thank you
[1:35:19] thank you Lord for
[1:35:22] saving me
[1:35:24] I'd sermon I'd thought I'd point
[1:35:28] but getting the whole point
[1:35:32] all was not a Calvinist that's what man
[1:35:36] said he was James was not an Armenian
[1:35:40] that's what man says they were
[1:35:42] what are you and I say about the Bible
[1:35:47] the Bible tells me I'm perfect man says
[1:35:52] I can't be
[1:35:55] right
[1:35:56] come on the Bible says be ye therefore
[1:35:59] perfect even as your father in heaven is
[1:36:01] perfect
[1:36:02] therefore leaving the principles of
[1:36:04] doctrine or not let us go on to
[1:36:05] perfection
[1:36:09] but man says we're not perfect
[1:36:16] it's perfect even as your father in
[1:36:18] heaven is perfect
[1:36:21] all right ain't know why we'd be perfect
[1:36:24] brother Dale I
[1:36:25] don't like the sign on the back of the
[1:36:29] car
[1:36:30] that says I'm not perfect I'm just
[1:36:34] forgiven now that might sound good to
[1:36:37] you but it don't to me I've got a little
[1:36:40] sense to know if I'm forgiven I'm
[1:36:41] perfect
[1:36:45] if I'm forgiven I'm perfect
[1:36:50] told you your son is not telling you
[1:36:53] what you see Church
[1:36:56] salvation is of the Lord jano to know
[1:36:59] whatever it be wherever he made what
[1:37:02] choice he done whatever goes with
[1:37:04] mankind we should be happy to understand
[1:37:07] the Word of God that tells us that proof
[1:37:10] that we can jump rejoice and glory in
[1:37:13] the fact of what that he has done for
[1:37:15] you and I
[1:37:16] that he chose us
[1:37:19] then when he chose us he had to come
[1:37:21] down and mic away
[1:37:24] he didn't send somebody else he came
[1:37:27] himself to make away let's tan
[1:37:30] well you gotta bring sand in somewhere

[1:38:12] pray we start after God but it should
[1:38:15] not us it was God pulling us
[1:38:19] [Music]

[1:38:23] slow down long enough and set out and
[1:38:25] shut up

[1:39:00] for another that the Lord would bless
[1:39:02] our Father we thank you we know that
[1:39:05] what we tried to say today it's been in

[1:39:14] it right so you say it

[1:39:20] and let us know and so to see that Lord
[1:39:23] you chose us

[1:39:28] because that's the only way that we
[1:39:31] could ever be pure the only way a human
[1:39:34] being can never be perfect is to realize
[1:39:36] he's resting in God
[1:39:39] there's God inside of him
[1:39:42] making the way
