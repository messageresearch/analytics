[16:43] things to you in the name of jesus
[16:45] christ we pray amen
[16:47] amen john chapter 6 beginning at verse 1
[16:52] and it says after these things jesus
[16:54] went over
[16:56] the sea of galilee which is the sea of
[16:58] tiberias and a great multitude followed
[17:00] him because they saw his miracles which
[17:03] he did on them that were diseased and
[17:05] jesus went up into a mountain
[17:08] and there he sat with his disciples
[17:11] and the passover a feast of the jews was
[17:14] not when jesus then lifted up his eyes
[17:17] and saw a great company come unto him
[17:20] he saith unto philip when shall we buy
[17:22] bread
[17:24] that these may eat
[17:26] but this he said
[17:29] to prove him for he himself knew what he
[17:32] would do
[17:34] and that's where i got my title from he
[17:35] knew what he would do
[17:40] and philip answered him said 200 penny
[17:42] worth of bread is not sufficient for
[17:44] them that every one of them may take a
[17:47] little
[17:48] one of his disciples andrews simon
[17:50] peter's brother saith unto him there is
[17:52] a lad here which has five barley loaves
[17:56] and two small fishes but what are they
[17:59] among so many
[18:01] and jesus said make the men sit down now
[18:04] there was much grass in the place so the
[18:07] men sat down in number about five
[18:09] thousand
[18:10] and jesus took the loaves and when he
[18:12] had given thanks he distributed to the
[18:15] disciples and the disciples to them that
[18:17] were set down and likewise of the fishes
[18:20] as much as they would
[18:22] when they were filled he said unto his
[18:24] disciples gather up the fragments that
[18:26] remain that nothing be lost therefore
[18:29] they gathered them together and filled
[18:30] 12 baskets with the fragments of the
[18:33] five barley loaves which remained
[18:35] over and above unto them that had eaten
[18:38] and those men when they had
[18:41] seen
[18:42] the miracle that jesus did this is of a
[18:45] truth said this is of a truth
[18:48] that prophet that would come
[18:50] into the world
[18:52] and i believe that's deuteronomy 18 is
[18:54] this is the scripture where
[18:56] moses said that
[18:58] god would raise up a prophet like unto
[19:00] me
[19:01] he said when jesus therefore perceived
[19:03] it they would come and take him by force
[19:05] to make him a king he departed again
[19:07] into a mountain himself
[19:09] alone amen god bless you tonight
[19:12] lord bless the reading of the word
[19:17] so
[19:21] just take a little phone
[19:27] he knew what he would do
[19:29] god always knows what he's going to do
[19:32] you know the good thing about god is
[19:34] he's
[19:36] never been caught off guard
[19:40] never been surprised
[19:42] you know
[19:44] he already knows what the end from the
[19:47] beginning so we don't ever have to worry
[19:48] about that
[19:52] is from the message the infallible proof
[19:54] of the resurrection
[19:57] brother brahm says
[19:59] and then what is a word
[20:01] is a thought expressed when god once
[20:03] thought how he would make the plan of
[20:05] redemption and how he redeemed man by
[20:07] foreknowledge knowing that some would
[20:09] desire it and some would be redeemed he
[20:11] thought of the plan and then when he
[20:13] spoke the word it was already a finished
[20:15] work in heaven when god spoke it we're
[20:18] told in the bible that jesus was a lamb
[20:20] slain from the foundation of the world
[20:23] we understand he wasn't slain really
[20:25] until four thousand years later but when
[20:27] god spoke the word it was a finished
[20:29] work when god spoke it he was slain back
[20:32] here at the foundation of the world
[20:35] when
[20:36] god foresaw and knew
[20:38] what he would do and he spoke the word
[20:40] it was finished right there and he said
[20:43] and give you a little courage which i
[20:44] find amongst the american christians
[20:47] that the great lack is is a fear the
[20:49] american christian seems to be afraid
[20:51] that god won't keep his word afraid if
[20:54] you just don't squeeze and hold or
[20:56] something it's nothing that you can do
[20:58] in the beginning it's what god has done
[21:01] said you never saw god though you
[21:03] thought you did but the bible claims you
[21:05] didn't no man seeks god his nature from
[21:08] the garden of eden proves that he's a
[21:11] coward and runs when he sins it wasn't
[21:13] god calling it wasn't adam calling god
[21:16] it was god calling adam and the bible
[21:18] says that you
[21:20] you might rest assure that your names
[21:22] were written on the land on the book of
[21:24] life your
[21:26] that your names were written on the book
[21:27] of life your names who are in the body
[21:30] of christ the night was written on the
[21:31] book of life before the foundation of
[21:33] the world that's what the bible said in
[21:35] revelations and he deceived all that
[21:37] dwelt upon the earth whose names were
[21:39] not written in the lamb's book of life
[21:41] from the foundation of the world so when
[21:43] the lamb and god's great knowledge was
[21:45] slain here by his word at the beginning
[21:47] you were slain with him
[21:49] when the world
[21:50] first began
[21:53] so
[21:54] you know
[21:55] it gives us it gives assurance
[22:00] it's a it's a blessing to know where we
[22:03] come from and
[22:06] you know
[22:07] i just kept i just kept being drawn back
[22:09] to the scripture because you know it was
[22:11] so amazing that you know the the
[22:14] the multitude always followed jesus and
[22:16] always wanted to know you know where he
[22:18] was at and what was going on
[22:20] and you know when he when he went
[22:22] through there and and they were amazed
[22:23] because you know they had looked for a a
[22:26] one to fulfill this scripture that that
[22:29] moses had prophesied and all the other
[22:31] ones that we had uh
[22:33] talked about all the different
[22:34] prophecies that went forth and here he
[22:36] was in their midst and you know and and
[22:38] all of this you know god is always
[22:40] mindful of his people
[22:43] and here's jesus mindful of the of these
[22:45] people that that have been going and
[22:47] following him all this time
[22:50] but you know it was it's amazing that
[22:52] there you know when
[22:54] there's three things that stand out to
[22:56] me in this in this passage of scripture
[22:59] number one is you know he he begins to
[23:02] ask philip
[23:03] and has philip looking at this multitude
[23:07] and he turns to him and he says he said
[23:09] where are we going to find bread to feed
[23:10] all these people
[23:13] and he begins to have philip look and he
[23:16] said he done this to prove philip
[23:19] so philip what are you going to look
[23:21] well i'm going to look at this multitude
[23:24] well how far away from town
[23:27] and the first thing that the philip does
[23:29] is look at the finances
[23:31] 200 pennyworth is not going to buy a
[23:33] whole lot of bread
[23:35] when you got at least 5 000 men and you
[23:37] didn't counted the women and children
[23:39] right
[23:41] i mean you might get a crumb
[23:44] but you ain't gonna get nothing
[23:47] and so here's here's philip look at you
[23:49] know how we gonna do this you know there
[23:52] ain't
[23:53] no there's nothing that we we have in
[23:55] our midst that's gonna take care of this
[23:58] but you know he brings this but he
[24:00] brings this up to philip
[24:03] because he knew what he was going to do
[24:06] and number two when he begins to just
[24:08] talk to the disciples about this
[24:10] situation about feeding this multitude
[24:13] if he knew all things
[24:15] because if if you knew the beginning
[24:17] from the end
[24:20] and
[24:20] as we were talking about you know all
[24:22] things the whole plan the word was from
[24:24] the beginning god never had a new
[24:26] thought
[24:27] amen
[24:28] so he knew what was going to take place
[24:30] so when when they were standing there
[24:32] they were looking at this situation then
[24:34] you know that jesus already knew that
[24:36] andrew was going to find that little
[24:37] boy's lunch
[24:40] before before he even asked philip he
[24:42] knew where that little boy's lunch was
[24:45] but he turned and andrew got went and
[24:46] got this little boy's lunch because the
[24:48] disciples were out looking
[24:50] they're looking all around
[24:54] and jesus is speaking to them about
[24:56] about the needs of the multitude and
[24:58] they're turning around and looking at
[25:00] everything else
[25:02] and as they were looking around they
[25:04] were you know trying what are we going
[25:05] to do well then andrew finds that little
[25:07] boy's life well you know we found a
[25:08] little boy's lunch
[25:10] we got five little barley loaves and two
[25:12] fish
[25:14] and the first thing that philip that
[25:16] andrew says is what is this among so
[25:19] many
[25:22] we can go buy what little bread we can
[25:24] with the money we got but that ain't
[25:26] gonna do anything we find a little boy's
[25:28] lunch and that ain't gonna do anything
[25:32] but you know what they if they if they
[25:34] knew if they understood the situation
[25:36] they wouldn't be looking around trying
[25:38] to figure out trying to solve the
[25:39] problem themselves
[25:42] why because if they had their trust and
[25:45] and see if we put our trust in jesus
[25:47] christ then we're not looking at the
[25:49] situation as the disciples are but we
[25:52] turn to god and say you can do it
[25:55] whatever you say
[25:56] amen you know what we see jesus doing
[25:59] the first miracle is when mary comes to
[26:02] him and says they've run out of wine at
[26:04] the wedding
[26:06] and when he stands there
[26:09] and she comes to him and then he turn
[26:11] she turns to the servants and the ones
[26:14] around him and says whatever he says do
[26:16] do it
[26:19] you know she didn't go nowhere else she
[26:21] didn't try to come up with no idea the
[26:23] first thing she done was went to jesus
[26:26] and said hey this is the need this is
[26:28] the problem
[26:33] and you know jesus why are you coming to
[26:34] me
[26:37] but you know she didn't even she just
[26:38] turned and said listen whatever he says
[26:40] do do that
[26:42] and so you know jesus says well then go
[26:44] get the water pots and fill them full
[26:48] and so then they began to feel the water
[26:50] pots full and when they got them full
[26:52] then he said dip out and take to the
[26:54] governor of the feast
[26:57] that's right
[26:58] but see then then it's not looking and
[27:01] trying to figure out how we're going to
[27:02] solve this problem
[27:05] but the first thing he does is he tells
[27:07] them jesus tells the disciples make the
[27:09] men sit down
[27:11] so go sit down
[27:13] and let's look
[27:16] and when he sits down then he begins to
[27:18] distribute
[27:20] he took this one little boy's lunch and
[27:22] he begins to break
[27:26] and he began to pass through the
[27:27] disciples and they began to pass out
[27:32] and then when he began to pass out then
[27:34] it began to multiply
[27:37] that's right amen
[27:43] you know it's it's so it's so great
[27:47] because you know that's the type of the
[27:48] five-fold ministry
[27:52] because you know what we're not
[27:54] preaching our own word
[27:56] we're not preaching our own thoughts
[28:00] i would be daresome to stand here and
[28:02] try to preach anything that i thought i
[28:04] could do in my own self
[28:08] and anybody that thinks they can is very
[28:10] ignorant
[28:11] and arrogant amen
[28:14] amen
[28:15] because you know what the fifo ministry
[28:17] is called of god and gifted of god
[28:21] so if it so you know we're not
[28:25] trying to take the place of somebody
[28:29] because even the prophet had his
[28:31] position and god gave
[28:33] brother branham a position to be in and
[28:36] then when he came he done his part but
[28:38] you know he he said that he said that
[28:40] god would raise up young men
[28:43] that would carry this and sweep this on
[28:44] to the coming of the lord
[28:46] amen that's right
[28:48] you know brother branham never quit
[28:50] ordaining ministers
[28:55] so it's always been in the scripture god
[28:57] never took it out of the scripture
[29:01] so you know what that's god's divine
[29:03] order that's god's divine plan so it
[29:05] never did change
[29:07] so so when he began to break the word
[29:09] the the food to them and then he passed
[29:11] it on then you know what it said it then
[29:14] it said they ate till they were full
[29:18] amen the scripture the scripture says
[29:20] you know that they would eat
[29:22] all that they would want it
[29:25] he says
[29:26] as much as they would
[29:30] so you know nobody went hungry they ate
[29:31] all that they wanted
[29:33] and when they got done finished eating
[29:36] then they picked up the fragments
[29:39] he said no not let any not don't let any
[29:42] of it be lost
[29:44] and he filled up 12 baskets full
[29:50] and many times
[29:52] we look at things in in situations and
[29:54] we we wonder why things are the way that
[29:56] they are
[29:57] you know we get ourselves in the way
[30:01] but do we just turn to god and say
[30:03] listen we know what we i don't know what
[30:05] you're going to do but i know i know
[30:07] that you have the plan
[30:09] it's your plan so you know what i'm just
[30:11] going to get out of your way
[30:15] in the message the rapture brother
[30:17] branham says if god is infinite almighty
[30:20] all-powerful omnisci omnipresent
[30:23] omniscient why he knowed all things from
[30:25] the beginning
[30:27] so he note
[30:29] there's nothing out of cater
[30:32] it's just that we
[30:34] us that thinks it is
[30:37] it's everything run look back in his
[30:40] word see what he's doing then we'll have
[30:42] an understanding
[30:47] so you know when when things don't go
[30:50] the way we think they ought to go
[30:52] or we wonder why you know
[30:55] if you know it feels like sometimes it's
[30:57] us in the world
[31:00] and when i say us i don't mean like us
[31:02] as a group i'm talking about as an
[31:04] individual person
[31:06] when it feels like you in the world when
[31:07] it feels like me in the world
[31:11] when the devil likes to sit on your
[31:12] shoulder and talk to you and tell you
[31:14] you ain't got a friend in the world
[31:17] he wants to tell you how bad it is
[31:25] you know
[31:27] when brother branham you know was
[31:28] talking about when he lost his wife and
[31:30] he lost his daughter and going through
[31:32] that that hard time and
[31:34] sharon rose was dying and you know all
[31:36] that and the devil come to talk to him
[31:37] say well you know you've done all you've
[31:39] preached how good he was you preached
[31:41] that you know that he was a healer and
[31:42] he done all these different things and
[31:44] you've seen all these things take place
[31:45] and now he won't hear you
[31:49] but you know he did he was just like job
[31:51] you know he didn't approach him
[31:52] foolishly
[31:53] he didn't he didn't turn his back but
[31:55] you know because he said when i got
[31:56] ready to say and agree with him then the
[31:59] words came to me
[32:02] the words came to you know the lord
[32:04] gives and the lord takes away
[32:06] blessed be the name of the lord
[32:10] god gives us
[32:12] situations and he takes care of them and
[32:15] we and it may not be the way we we ought
[32:17] to see it or you know but you know what
[32:18] we just walk by faith
[32:21] you know brother branham said
[32:24] he said now
[32:26] he said notice notice now another
[32:30] hey this is from perfect faith perfect
[32:31] faith is a master of all circumstances
[32:34] perfect faith master circumstance all
[32:36] circumstances no matter what it is it
[32:38] masters it now just watch when you
[32:41] believe anything
[32:43] do anything you you've got faith in what
[32:46] you're doing no matter what the
[32:47] circumstances that don't have one thing
[32:50] to do with see it masters the
[32:52] circumstance
[32:53] if it's in a room full of sickness and
[32:55] the lord's revealed that this certain
[32:57] thing's going to happen you just speak
[32:59] it and go on
[33:01] oh does just don't ask any questions
[33:04] it's already over just keep going see it
[33:07] masters all circumstances well if you
[33:10] do this so-and-so is going to do that
[33:13] see it's already got it mastered see
[33:17] faith believes what god that believes
[33:20] that god will work it out i don't know
[33:22] how he's going to do it but he'll do it
[33:25] anyhow see it masters all circumstances
[33:34] we just put our trust in him
[33:39] you know we just put our our faith in
[33:41] what he will do
[33:44] when he spoke the word
[33:46] then whatever that situation is it'll
[33:48] come to pass
[33:51] we don't have we don't have to try to
[33:53] figure it out
[33:55] but you know what god will equip you in
[33:57] that situation to handle that situation
[34:02] amen one of the stories that come to me
[34:04] and
[34:05] i've preached on this
[34:07] number of years ago but
[34:09] i still sometimes i just i you know you
[34:11] think about stories that you've read and
[34:13] and things and you know it just
[34:16] stirs you up sometimes and i i i was
[34:19] thinking back to
[34:20] years ago when i
[34:22] i was singing i want to i preached on a
[34:24] message about an expected end
[34:28] an unexpected way to an expected end
[34:31] jeremiah
[34:32] god told jeremiah he wrote to
[34:34] he said that he would he said i know my
[34:37] thoughts to you
[34:40] he said of good not of evil
[34:43] he said that i will bring you to an
[34:45] expected end
[34:48] so all the things that he had wrote to
[34:49] the children of israel in the scripture
[34:51] he's referring back to that to the
[34:53] prophet jeremiah and he's telling the
[34:55] children of israel listen i know what
[34:56] i've said about you and i know what i
[34:58] thought about you
[35:01] and he said i'm going to bring you to
[35:02] this end
[35:05] i'm going to bring you to this place
[35:10] but you know
[35:12] he began to
[35:15] speak
[35:17] you know he told the children of israel
[35:19] to moses he said i'm going to take you
[35:21] to a land flowing with milk and honey
[35:24] your father abraham walked in this land
[35:27] and every place he put his foot it was
[35:30] his possession
[35:34] and you know god carried them over into
[35:36] that land and they began to see what god
[35:38] had done for them
[35:40] but you know what it was it was because
[35:42] of their faith
[35:46] it was not god but it was their faith
[35:48] that failed to take full possession of
[35:51] the land
[35:53] they couldn't drive out the enemy why
[35:54] because god god wasn't the one that
[35:56] failed them they failed themselves they
[35:59] failed to walk in the word that god had
[36:00] given to them the commission that god
[36:02] had given to them to drive the enemy out
[36:05] why because they begun to become play
[36:07] complacent in the land
[36:09] they began to just to mingle with the
[36:12] people that were in the land
[36:14] and they began to take on the ideas and
[36:16] the thoughts and and everything like
[36:18] that the culture of the world that they
[36:20] lived in
[36:23] and you know that became that became a
[36:25] thorn in their flesh the rest of their
[36:27] lives
[36:29] and all those years and then you know
[36:31] they were driven out of their homeland
[36:35] but you know what that that possession
[36:37] still belonged to the children of israel
[36:40] it still belonged to the descendants of
[36:42] abraham why because the word never
[36:45] changed their situation changed but it
[36:48] didn't give up god didn't broke his word
[36:52] and when the word came then it came time
[36:54] for them to go back to that homeland
[36:56] god made a way for them to go back
[37:02] back in the first world war
[37:05] they were the arabs had palestine and if
[37:08] you if you read mark twain wrote a a
[37:11] commentary on palestine
[37:15] and i read part of the last last time
[37:18] when i preached on it and you just just
[37:20] how horrible it was how pathetic and ju
[37:23] i mean you i mean there's there's no i
[37:25] mean when you read the old testament and
[37:27] you think about a land flowing with milk
[37:29] and honey and all these things and then
[37:31] when you see palestine it's like there's
[37:33] no way that that land is what god wrote
[37:36] about
[37:37] it's an absolute wasteland nobody would
[37:39] want that
[37:42] but you know in the first world war they
[37:44] were jews that took everything that they
[37:47] had everything that they could scrape up
[37:49] and they went over there
[37:51] and they wanted to buy part of that land
[37:54] and you know the arabs the only thing
[37:56] that the arabs would sell them over
[37:58] there was worthless just
[38:01] bearing wasteland that nobody else would
[38:03] want
[38:06] and they sold it to them for over three
[38:08] times the value of the land
[38:11] and the arabs the arabs laughed all the
[38:13] way to the bank said we
[38:15] we just
[38:16] just got over on all these jews look we
[38:18] took all our money
[38:20] them jews were standing there saying
[38:22] them arabs don't understand said we were
[38:24] willing to pay 10 times the value of the
[38:26] land why because those those jews when
[38:29] they went over there and they saw that
[38:31] land
[38:33] and they had never walked in that land
[38:34] before
[38:35] but when they began to walk in that land
[38:37] do you know that was the land that their
[38:39] father abraham had walked on and that
[38:41] was the first time the jews had stepped
[38:43] on that
[38:47] that was promised to them
[38:49] god promised that to them
[38:52] and there was no price too great that
[38:54] they wouldn't pay to walk on that land
[38:57] to walk in and take possession of it
[39:01] and there was this swampy land and it
[39:03] had it and
[39:05] it was just so poor
[39:07] and those people went over there and
[39:09] took this land and they were so happy
[39:11] and so thrilled and nobody else could
[39:12] see what they were excited about
[39:15] but they saw they saw the promise of god
[39:18] but nobody else saw that
[39:21] when those people were out there and
[39:23] they they didn't have any uh
[39:25] equipment they got out there with hand
[39:27] tools hand shovels and dug ditches and
[39:29] done everything and they got the water
[39:31] flowing so it wouldn't be stale
[39:34] and every one of them standing out there
[39:36] with malaria
[39:40] and i thought these people have lost
[39:42] their minds
[39:44] every one of them's almost dead and
[39:45] every day they'd get up
[39:48] they're elderly people they could barely
[39:51] walk but you know what they said this is
[39:53] our land this is god's this is god's
[39:55] promise to me
[39:58] and got out there digging
[40:01] [Music]
[40:04] but you know that was the first that was
[40:05] the first time that they had jews in in
[40:08] palestine
[40:10] at that time that they had actually
[40:12] taken possession of part of that land
[40:16] and you know everybody else so man those
[40:18] people are kooks but you know what there
[40:20] was something that was stirring up
[40:21] inside those people that this was the
[40:23] fulfillment of god's word
[40:28] and those people hung on
[40:30] and been ridiculed and scorned and all
[40:32] of the things that they had to face all
[40:35] time through that time up until the time
[40:38] that the british carved out a piece of
[40:40] land for the jews after world war ii
[40:43] when the when they divided the land and
[40:44] they cut off the portion there and they
[40:47] said this is palestine we're giving this
[40:49] to the jews
[40:50] and god began to tell the jews hey you
[40:52] can come home because after the second
[40:54] world war they did not have a homeland
[40:58] europe didn't want them everybody you
[41:00] know even american only could take so
[41:02] many and they didn't want the rest of
[41:03] them
[41:04] there's no place for them to go
[41:08] but god was fulfilling his word
[41:11] he cut off that portion of land over
[41:13] there and he began to send those people
[41:15] there
[41:17] and those people didn't want to get on
[41:18] planes as brother ram talked about they
[41:20] didn't want to get on planes they didn't
[41:21] want to do anything but he said he said
[41:23] listen he said our prophets have told us
[41:25] he said we're going to go home on the
[41:26] wings of eagles
[41:32] when they said are you going home to die
[41:33] i said no i'm going home to see the
[41:35] messiah
[41:36] one because they were rejoicing in what
[41:38] they saw nobody else saw that
[41:41] nobody else could believe that but they
[41:43] went over there and began to take this
[41:45] waste land this barren land
[41:49] and when they had when nobody else could
[41:51] do anything with it why because they
[41:53] were walking in the word of god
[41:56] and all of a sudden now you know they
[41:58] they've been able to
[42:00] turn that place into a lush garden in
[42:03] the middle of nowhere
[42:05] of all the things that they've been able
[42:06] to do
[42:09] but you know they saw something nobody
[42:11] else saw
[42:13] they didn't they didn't see they didn't
[42:14] see the wasteland and all those problems
[42:17] and everything like that
[42:20] they went home to see the messiah
[42:26] and many times you know
[42:28] if we face the word and we see the word
[42:30] and you know brother man said not for
[42:32] don't let us let the word become common
[42:35] to us
[42:37] but you know sometimes we can do that we
[42:39] can be just like that we can hear the
[42:40] word of god and see it and you know when
[42:42] the situation looks bad and it doesn't
[42:45] line up the way we want it to and
[42:46] everything like that but we don't look
[42:48] and say this is where god's going to
[42:49] meet us this is where god's going to
[42:50] bless us
[42:53] we don't see like they saw
[42:56] but you know what they begin to look and
[42:58] see this was this is what god had
[42:59] promised them
[43:02] and nobody else is going to say the
[43:03] world's not going to see this
[43:07] but it's but it's only to a chosen few
[43:10] it's not to the world there's many
[43:12] people you know no wonder people you
[43:13] know people have left this message about
[43:16] because
[43:16] it's the it's the time it's the time of
[43:19] the falling away they walked in this for
[43:21] so long but now it's time to leave why
[43:23] because they don't see the beauty in it
[43:27] amen
[43:29] one because isaiah said when he was
[43:30] speaking of jesus he said he said there
[43:32] was no beauty that they should desire
[43:34] him
[43:35] well they don't see no beauty they just
[43:37] see this ugly they say the hunter parts
[43:39] of the people they just see the ugliness
[43:41] of the word
[43:44] they don't see the beauty
[43:52] as brother brandon was telling the story
[43:55] about the about the young girl that
[44:02] you know she her mother had sent her off
[44:04] to school and
[44:06] you know she was riding the train back
[44:07] home
[44:09] when she when she pulled in there her
[44:11] mother was that had been burnt in the
[44:12] fire and you know the girls were making
[44:14] ridicule and said who is this ugly woman
[44:19] you know it embarrassed that girl she
[44:22] became embarrassed by what her mother
[44:24] the way her mother looked
[44:27] but you know when she got off the train
[44:28] her mother come to hug her and greet her
[44:30] and you know she just tr ignored her
[44:32] mother like she didn't know who she was
[44:35] but said the conductor on the train got
[44:37] a hold of that girl and told her said
[44:38] listen
[44:40] said i want you to know something
[44:42] said i remember when your mother was was
[44:45] way much beautiful than you are
[44:50] but she had love for you
[44:52] instead of letting you die in that house
[44:53] fire
[44:55] she stripped her clothes off and ran
[44:57] through the fire
[44:58] to get you out
[45:02] he said it made it may not look
[45:04] beautiful to the world
[45:07] but you ought to have love and honor
[45:09] respect for your mother for what she's
[45:10] done for you
[45:14] you know what as paul said he said i'm
[45:16] not ashamed of the gospel of jesus
[45:18] christ
[45:20] for it is the power of god unto
[45:21] salvation
[45:23] one because he knew what he knew where
[45:24] he come from he knew what he had been
[45:26] through
[45:29] and just and just like that girl you
[45:30] know she become embarrassed by the
[45:32] things that that that her mother was
[45:38] but when you begin to look what she done
[45:41] and the world and the world's not going
[45:43] to desire jesus he's not gonna they're
[45:45] not gonna desire the word the word
[45:50] but you know when you begin to look to
[45:51] see where you i was once lost but now
[45:54] i'm found
[45:55] amen
[45:56] when you begin to see where you come
[45:58] from
[46:00] and you know where you where you are
[46:02] today
[46:03] and what god has done for you then when
[46:05] you when you come back say well i don't
[46:07] care if nobody else likes it
[46:09] it doesn't it doesn't have to please
[46:10] anybody else
[46:13] i know where i come from i know what
[46:15] he's done for me
[46:16] i'm not i'm not i don't have to satisfy
[46:18] the world
[46:21] it's just it's just it's just a
[46:22] fellowship between it's just communion
[46:24] between me and
[46:27] i'm god
[46:27] i'm not worried about what the world
[46:29] says
[46:44] you know
[46:52] gonna start be like brother bob up here
[46:56] but i tell you what it feels good
[47:03] this is from the message
[47:05] what it takes to overcome all unbelief
[47:10] brother man's talking about the the
[47:12] apple trees and he says every apple
[47:14] that's ever been in that trees
[47:16] he said is in it right then
[47:18] certainly is if it doesn't
[47:21] where does it come from it's in the tree
[47:23] he said and you plant the tree in the
[47:25] ground you irrigate it you put water on
[47:27] it what does that little tree do
[47:29] he said it grows
[47:34] and
[47:35] why
[47:36] how it grows it drinks
[47:38] it draws from the water
[47:41] draws from the earth water
[47:43] it draws more than its portion
[47:45] more than enough to fill it it draws
[47:47] just so much until it pushes out limbs
[47:50] and branches and apples then goes down
[47:52] and hides through the wintertime keeps
[47:54] the south from being killed in the tree
[47:57] what intelligence runs it down into the
[47:59] ground and hides it through the winter
[48:02] he said put a water in a 10 cup set on
[48:04] the fence see if it'll go down when the
[48:06] winter time comes certainly it won't
[48:08] some intelligence runs it down that same
[48:10] intelligence that runs the water in
[48:12] there is the same spirit of god that's
[48:14] brought us together for this convention
[48:18] the same spirit that's bringing us
[48:19] together here under the heavenly places
[48:21] in christ jesus to find his goodness and
[48:24] mercy for the hours that lay ahead of us
[48:27] oh he's real god is
[48:30] so he's brought us to this place why
[48:32] because now's the time of the feeling
[48:37] the time of refreshing you know i mean
[48:39] the
[48:40] every church service is a time to come
[48:42] in and get all that you can
[48:47] and fill up
[48:49] he said we find out this little tree it
[48:51] pushes out when it grows it pushes out
[48:53] and when you are born into the kingdom
[48:55] of god just a little baby in christ
[48:57] everything that you have need of
[49:00] need of in this life's journey is in you
[49:02] when you receive the holy ghost oh then
[49:05] what do you have to do is drink and
[49:07] drink and keep on drinking
[49:09] don't just
[49:10] don't just stop when you join church and
[49:12] are baptized just keep drinking until
[49:14] you have faith for this and faith for
[49:16] that and faith for this and push out
[49:18] until all the manifestations of the holy
[49:21] spirit is living in the church
[49:24] he said and he says and a rewarder of
[49:26] those that diligently seek him he said
[49:28] how are we planted we're planted in
[49:30] christ jesus now i believe just in my
[49:32] estimation of him he's the inexhaustible
[49:34] fountain of life that you cannot exhaust
[49:37] his goodness some people think oh i hate
[49:39] to call on god so much that's what he
[49:41] wants you to do
[49:43] you have not because you ask not you ask
[49:46] not because you believe not ask
[49:48] abundantly that your joys might be full
[49:50] that's what god wants ask big things
[49:56] so when god has called us to this place
[50:00] god's called us to this word then it's
[50:02] now it's our time
[50:06] to get what what we have need of it
[50:09] to drink
[50:11] and he said he's an inexhaustible
[50:13] fountain
[50:14] so then we just continue to drink and
[50:16] take in all that we can
[50:18] as he said he said
[50:20] get more than your portion
[50:22] get more than enough
[50:26] because you know when we see these
[50:28] situations come just like the disciples
[50:30] you know they're looking at the
[50:31] situation well you know what god's in
[50:33] the situation
[50:35] we turn to god and we can find what we
[50:37] have need of that he can give us
[50:38] everything that we have need
[50:41] that we can
[50:43] he said keep drinking until all the
[50:45] manifestations
[50:48] of the holy spirit
[50:50] are made known
[50:52] so how do you grow
[50:54] you keep drinking
[50:55] [Music]
[50:58] then you keep drinking
[51:04] you know you just keep fighting the
[51:05] battle
[51:07] you keep pressing in
[51:08] because the battle he said you the
[51:10] kingdom of god is taken by forces then
[51:12] what you do you just keep on fighting
[51:14] and you keep on pulling
[51:16] you know even even the tree when you
[51:18] talk about that tree it is down in the
[51:20] roots and you know even in the
[51:21] wintertime
[51:23] and
[51:25] i didn't i didn't know this and wait
[51:26] said i can't believe you didn't know
[51:27] that well i didn't know that
[51:30] praise the lord
[51:32] but you know even when the life goes
[51:34] down in the roots you know that life is
[51:36] in there in the summertime
[51:38] now the root you know the life goes up
[51:40] into the tree and it's the leaves and
[51:42] the fruit and all those type things but
[51:44] when it goes down in the winter time and
[51:46] it goes down in into the root system
[51:49] do you know the the roots never quit
[51:51] growing
[51:53] you know what even in the winter time
[51:54] when we said well that tree's dead
[51:57] well it's dormant
[51:59] why because we don't see anything
[52:02] but we don't recognize that there's
[52:03] growth taking place if we could dig down
[52:06] into the ground down in those routes
[52:08] when it gets below the frost line
[52:10] and the ground is still warm and there's
[52:12] moisture down there then you know those
[52:13] roots are still going
[52:15] they're still
[52:16] going and they're still reaching out
[52:20] and many times we look at our lives and
[52:21] we say well it's it's a it's a it's a
[52:24] dead season it's it you know we're just
[52:27] in this in this lull or whatever and
[52:29] it's just like you know everything is so
[52:30] hard and we don't see but you know one
[52:32] time when we look back in our lives when
[52:34] we go through these hard spells these
[52:36] dry spells all these things that happen
[52:38] to us and we wonder why things are going
[52:39] many times when we look back then we we
[52:42] recognize that we've grown through that
[52:43] time we didn't see it looking forward
[52:45] but when we look back you know what
[52:46] we've grown through those times well we
[52:48] don't recognize the growth that takes
[52:50] place
[52:54] you know it's just like your kids when
[52:55] you watch your kids grow up
[52:59] you know we just see them and all of a
[53:00] sudden
[53:01] one day you know we they walk past us
[53:03] you know i mean you know one time
[53:05] they're all the time like this next
[53:06] thing you know they're like this and
[53:08] then all of a sudden they block your
[53:09] vision when they walk past it's like
[53:12] come here
[53:15] why because you when you see them every
[53:17] day and they just keep on growing you
[53:19] don't recognize the growth
[53:23] one day you buy them shoes
[53:27] and you buy shoes and and it's like well
[53:29] you got these shoes and before they wear
[53:30] them out they're already outgrown them
[53:35] and it's like do they put miracle grow
[53:37] in the shoe
[53:39] it's like they put them on and their toe
[53:41] grows to the end of them
[53:43] and it's like you don't see the growth
[53:45] but all of a sudden all of a sudden
[53:46] there's the proof
[53:49] and it's the same way we don't we don't
[53:51] see the growth taking place but you know
[53:53] what many times in our lives we're
[53:55] wondering why why things are the way
[53:56] they are and you know what many times
[53:58] and we're waiting for god and we then
[54:00] god will take us to a place and look
[54:02] back it's like well you know what we
[54:03] have grown
[54:06] amen
[54:07] many times we don't we don't think that
[54:08] we had
[54:09] you know we've overcome things or are
[54:11] different things and you know we've had
[54:13] you know you see different things in
[54:15] your life that's happening and you look
[54:16] back he's like i've overcome that
[54:24] anything
[54:25] well thank god
[54:27] god's helped me through that
[54:29] amen
[54:32] because then we see you
[54:34] we see the growth that's taking place
[54:39] see god god knows what he's going to do
[54:44] sometimes he wants us to see what we're
[54:46] going to do
[54:50] many times
[54:52] he says we walk by faith and not by
[54:54] sight
[54:58] and many times that's the problem we're
[54:59] walking by sight
[55:03] we see we see the things around us and
[55:05] sometimes
[55:06] by looking
[55:08] at the things around us and not looking
[55:10] at the word
[55:11] we don't see
[55:13] what
[55:14] what god has done and where we're at
[55:22] this is from the
[55:23] the patmos vision
[55:29] brother random says
[55:31] oh you say you
[55:32] you don't feel any difference though
[55:36] he said jesus wasn't born when god
[55:38] slayed him before the foundation of the
[55:40] world
[55:41] when he was the lamb of god slain before
[55:43] the foundation of the world but in god's
[55:46] own mind he was already it was he was
[55:47] already done
[55:49] i wasn't here
[55:51] then neither neither was you but in
[55:53] god's book if our names was ever on
[55:56] there it was put on before the
[55:57] foundation of the world
[55:59] when god says anything it has to take
[56:02] place so when you meet god's
[56:04] qualifications just remember god will
[56:06] manifest himself and take care of the
[56:08] rest of it
[56:09] you just go ahead it is a finished work
[56:12] oh isn't that wonderful i think just
[56:14] tell god and god said you do this and
[56:17] i'll do this well if i do this he's got
[56:20] to do that amen
[56:24] so when god brings us you know when we
[56:26] when we say well we don't see any
[56:27] difference
[56:29] well people coming in the prayer line
[56:31] it's like well you know i don't feel any
[56:32] different
[56:34] well your feelings don't matter
[56:39] he said you know if he calls your name
[56:43] when brother branham was in the
[56:44] discernment line
[56:45] you know he would catch people and say
[56:47] oh sir you didn't believe you didn't
[56:48] know that you had that much faith
[56:52] but god's speaking to you and you're
[56:54] healed
[56:55] or people would come across the platform
[56:57] and he would lay hands on them
[56:59] and there were times that he wouldn't
[57:00] even pray for he would just lay hands on
[57:02] them
[57:04] well because the scripture he said if
[57:05] you lay hands on the sick they'll
[57:06] recover
[57:07] he didn't say you had to pray you just
[57:09] say lay hands on him
[57:11] so when they passed by brother just laid
[57:13] hands on them
[57:16] and he and he you know he would speak to
[57:18] him and he would ask them
[57:20] he said do you believe me to be god's
[57:21] servant
[57:25] do you believe the word that i've spoke
[57:26] tonight
[57:27] do you believe that jesus christ is here
[57:33] do you believe that he'll heal you
[57:35] he'll deliver you that's right amen
[57:38] and you know they begin yes yes yes
[57:41] he said by your own confession he said
[57:44] go and receive your healing
[57:47] so it wasn't it wasn't that that he had
[57:49] to do anything but he had to get to get
[57:51] the people to believe and to see and
[57:53] focus on one thing and he said when they
[57:55] begin to see that then yeah
[57:57] then he has
[58:00] and then there were times when he talked
[58:01] about how full the the building was just
[58:03] full of faith you could just see it
[58:04] throughout the building he said just
[58:05] stand to your feet and claim you accept
[58:07] your healing he said you don't have to
[58:09] have somebody anybody pray for you or do
[58:12] anything he said you just stand up and
[58:13] claim it
[58:15] and so here he is well i don't feel like
[58:18] well that has nothing to do with it
[58:21] if god began to speak to you and say
[58:23] this is what this what i want to give
[58:25] you
[58:28] when he begins to speak just not only is
[58:30] it divine healing but whatever you have
[58:32] need of
[58:34] and when he said add to your faith
[58:35] virtue well you know when god begins to
[58:37] speak to you then you accept what he has
[58:39] to say
[58:41] then you know what it's just the same
[58:43] thing it's the same faith it's the same
[58:45] process
[58:47] that when you begin to accept the word
[58:48] receive the lord he said when you
[58:50] receive the word then you become the
[58:51] word then you begin to walk in the word
[58:55] and it's the same process it's not it's
[58:58] not some some one way of doing one thing
[59:00] and one that way doing something else no
[59:02] it's the same way god works the same way
[59:04] every single time
[59:08] so if god ever had anything that he
[59:10] wanted to give you then you know what
[59:11] you claim it the same way
[59:17] said so
[59:18] he said if you if you meet god's
[59:19] qualifications
[59:22] you just believe and walk
[59:25] right
[59:26] and say lord don't let me have any
[59:27] stumbling blocks in my way
[59:30] lord let me get everything out of the
[59:31] way let me clear the way let me clear
[59:33] the path
[59:35] lord let me clean out the flus let me
[59:37] get everything out of the way lord that
[59:39] i can that you can come speak to me
[59:41] lord that i can come on the same grounds
[59:43] the same qualifications that others have
[59:46] come that i can receive the same thing
[59:50] that i've been that you know god because
[59:51] you you by your word you've come and you
[59:54] told us lord don't come up this statue
[59:55] of a perfect man and to add our faith
[59:58] virtue and to virtue knowledge and
[59:59] knowledge temperance and come on up the
[1:00:01] ladder well then lord then the lord
[1:00:03] deliberately just continue let us grow
[1:00:05] that we walk up that ladder amen that
[1:00:07] would be that you become molded in into
[1:00:09] our in our lives
[1:00:11] lord that we're molded into your image
[1:00:14] lord that the world can see
[1:00:16] jesus christ in us
[1:00:20] but he said he said you just go ahead he
[1:00:21] said he said one because he said it's
[1:00:23] finished he said so he'll take care of
[1:00:25] the rest of it but there's a part you
[1:00:27] got to play there's a part you got to do
[1:00:28] he said i will take the rest i'll take
[1:00:30] care of the rest
[1:00:40] but if we will do what god wants us to
[1:00:42] do
[1:00:43] do the same thing
[1:00:45] take god at his word
[1:00:47] follow follow the pattern
[1:00:53] if we follow the pattern then you know
[1:00:54] what god will bring to pass his word
[1:00:57] amen
[1:01:00] you know uh
[1:01:01] brother branham this is from watchmen
[1:01:02] water the night and brother branham this
[1:01:04] is the story brother i'm talking about
[1:01:06] the little boy the little baby that had
[1:01:08] cancer and they had to wrap the towel
[1:01:11] around his head
[1:01:14] and you know the uh the nurse had to
[1:01:15] clean out the breathing tube and and all
[1:01:17] that you know brother brandon's heart
[1:01:18] was broken
[1:01:20] and he's standing there and and he says
[1:01:23] he said i thought jesus do you mean you
[1:01:25] get pleasure out of seeing that
[1:01:28] he said i can't believe it i just i just
[1:01:30] can't believe you get glory out of that
[1:01:32] little baby suffering like that it just
[1:01:34] can't be
[1:01:36] if it makes me a sinner feel like i do
[1:01:39] to that baby what would
[1:01:40] what would it do to you the resource of
[1:01:43] all mercy what must you do
[1:01:46] and i had no
[1:01:48] no words yet
[1:01:52] he skipped we skipped down
[1:01:54] and he says and i looked down to this
[1:01:55] little fella and i thought lord
[1:01:58] what would you do if you were standing
[1:02:00] here
[1:02:02] now i realize that i'm in the pulpit i
[1:02:04] really and i realize that god is present
[1:02:05] but it seemed to me that something
[1:02:08] spoke down in my soul and he said i'm
[1:02:11] waiting to see what you're going to do
[1:02:12] about it
[1:02:14] i gave my authority to the church and
[1:02:16] there you come back again to say say to
[1:02:19] this mountain
[1:02:21] i gave my authority to the church and
[1:02:22] i'm waiting to see what you're going to
[1:02:24] do
[1:02:25] i wonder if that's his attitude toward
[1:02:27] us all the time that he's waiting to see
[1:02:30] what you're we're going to do
[1:02:33] what about the signs of the time we best
[1:02:35] we just been preaching about
[1:02:37] what would he do he's waiting to see
[1:02:39] what we'll do
[1:02:41] he said well i got i got this little
[1:02:43] baby
[1:02:44] baby hand in mind
[1:02:46] just in my fingers like that it was so
[1:02:48] little and i said lord hear the prayer
[1:02:50] of your servant and by faith that i
[1:02:52] believe that you are
[1:02:54] that i believe that you are
[1:02:56] i place between this demon of cancer in
[1:02:58] this baby's life the blood of jesus
[1:03:00] christ between the killer and the baby
[1:03:04] the blood by faith i placed it and i
[1:03:07] couldn't say nothing else
[1:03:11] and you know brother brian walked out of
[1:03:13] that room
[1:03:14] and it wasn't long right after that you
[1:03:16] know they come and told him said you
[1:03:17] know what he's healed
[1:03:22] but you know it was there was god
[1:03:24] speaking to the prophet and saying i
[1:03:26] wonder what you're going to do about it
[1:03:28] we always wonder what god gonna do about
[1:03:30] it well what is it what did you and he
[1:03:32] said sometimes that's what it looks like
[1:03:33] god is waiting on us to do something
[1:03:38] well sometimes you know have we ever
[1:03:39] asked god what god what do you want me
[1:03:41] to do what should i do
[1:03:44] what is my responsibility
[1:03:48] lord what is it what is it that that's
[1:03:50] my part to do
[1:03:54] you know when when abraham went to went
[1:03:56] to get a bribe for isaac and he sent
[1:03:59] elazar into the homeland to get a bride
[1:04:05] you know then he he swore out to eliezer
[1:04:08] you know he said listen he said you go
[1:04:09] and do and the lord will lead you he
[1:04:11] said but if you if you don't find one he
[1:04:13] said you're free of this oath
[1:04:17] but you know he said lord he said my
[1:04:18] father abraham my sir my
[1:04:21] master has sent me
[1:04:24] he said lord i'm going down in here he
[1:04:25] said lead me
[1:04:27] show me the way that i need to go
[1:04:30] and when he went down in there
[1:04:33] he said lord the one that i meet at the
[1:04:35] well
[1:04:37] he said let her be the one
[1:04:39] and then she'll offer to to water the
[1:04:42] camels amen
[1:04:44] and when he walked up there and then
[1:04:45] then rebecca began to speak to him and
[1:04:47] said well let me draw the water for you
[1:04:49] and let me water the camels and all that
[1:04:52] and he began you know began to converse
[1:04:55] and and all these things and he began to
[1:04:56] tell rebecca all about isaac and and all
[1:04:59] the things that took place and you know
[1:05:01] she received the word and she had to go
[1:05:03] talk to her father and her mother and
[1:05:04] her brother and the you know the family
[1:05:06] and you know they had to go through all
[1:05:08] that but you know she received that word
[1:05:09] and she believed it she said i'm going
[1:05:13] this is this is this is my calling
[1:05:18] you know and then she took she received
[1:05:20] the the gifts
[1:05:22] that isaac had sent by the prophet to
[1:05:25] her and she received those
[1:05:29] and all along this dangerous journey
[1:05:31] back to the back to the land but you
[1:05:33] know what she followed and she listened
[1:05:35] to what eliezer had to tell her
[1:05:38] and she listened and she she began to
[1:05:41] understand all about isaac
[1:05:45] but you know what the camel's done
[1:05:46] brother venom said that was the power of
[1:05:48] god bringing but that was you know that
[1:05:50] was only a certain port a part of what
[1:05:52] was to take place
[1:05:54] but you know what when she got close
[1:05:56] enough and she saw isaac in the field
[1:05:59] you know she didn't just sit on the
[1:06:01] camels and wait
[1:06:02] uh you can just drop me off right here
[1:06:08] when she saw him in the distance
[1:06:11] she didn't wait for the camels to bring
[1:06:12] her all the way
[1:06:14] when she began to see who who was before
[1:06:17] her
[1:06:18] because the word had been preached to
[1:06:20] her so much that she recognized isaac
[1:06:22] standing in the field
[1:06:26] well then you know what she put she took
[1:06:28] the bracelets and the gifts that she was
[1:06:31] given and she put a veil on her face and
[1:06:33] she took the gifts that were given to
[1:06:35] her and you know what and she went and
[1:06:37] met him in the field
[1:06:40] one because so you know
[1:06:42] god done his part
[1:06:45] and broad alleys are up
[1:06:48] and the word has been given
[1:06:51] but you know what it's time because the
[1:06:53] scripture tells us he said to rejoice he
[1:06:56] said because the bride has made herself
[1:06:58] ready
[1:06:59] so when she prepared herself then she
[1:07:01] went to meet the meet isaac to meet the
[1:07:04] bridegroom so the thing is is you know
[1:07:06] you and i have a responsibility to
[1:07:08] prepare ourselves for the bridegroom
[1:07:10] there's a portion there's a part that we
[1:07:12] must play that we must go do
[1:07:17] so what are you going to do lord
[1:07:20] well what are you going to do
[1:07:22] what is god calling us to do
[1:07:28] that's what god is asking you know
[1:07:30] because if if all
[1:07:32] that god was he poured into christ
[1:07:36] and he poured into the church he poured
[1:07:38] into the believers amen
[1:07:41] then you know what then we are there
[1:07:42] where were to be nothing less than jesus
[1:07:45] christ
[1:07:46] then we're supposed to be nothing less
[1:07:48] than
[1:07:49] completely dressed robed in his
[1:07:51] righteousness prepared
[1:07:54] then that's what god has for us to do is
[1:07:56] to prepare ourselves to do what he wants
[1:07:59] because he's already known what he's
[1:08:00] going to do the question is is what you
[1:08:03] and i are going to do what are we doing
[1:08:05] what are we doing with the time that we
[1:08:07] have what are we doing with the things
[1:08:08] that god has given us
[1:08:15] let's not get things out of cater let's
[1:08:17] not get things out of place
[1:08:23] you know jesus there when he when he fed
[1:08:26] the 5 000 and they collected all of
[1:08:28] those fragments and they gathered up all
[1:08:30] of those
[1:08:31] 12 baskets
[1:08:34] then the scripture says that those men
[1:08:36] that had seen that had seen the miracles
[1:08:38] had seen the food being distributed all
[1:08:41] those things then they turned around and
[1:08:43] said surely this is the one that the
[1:08:45] prophet spoke about that would come
[1:08:49] but you know what they got they tried to
[1:08:51] get him out of his place
[1:08:53] because jesus didn't come to set up a
[1:08:55] kingdom but that's what the scripture
[1:08:57] says they were waiting to to come and
[1:08:59] grab jesus to set up a king because they
[1:09:01] were going to make him their king and
[1:09:02] when he when he saw what they were going
[1:09:04] to do then he left
[1:09:07] he departed out of their midst
[1:09:11] and brothers and sisters you know that's
[1:09:12] the time when brother brahma said you
[1:09:13] know there are things that we should do
[1:09:15] and we shouldn't do
[1:09:17] we shouldn't misconstrue the word we
[1:09:20] shouldn't get things out of place
[1:09:24] so the spirit in us that has been given
[1:09:26] to us is given to us for us to directly
[1:09:28] divide the word
[1:09:32] so in the time of of this of this world
[1:09:34] that we live in all the confusion and
[1:09:36] all of the chaos and all these things
[1:09:38] but there is one that is still leading
[1:09:40] us
[1:09:41] that is leading us the right way
[1:09:45] that's going to bring us to the proper
[1:09:47] place
[1:09:49] bring us all the way
[1:09:52] he knows what he's going to do the
[1:09:53] question is do you know what you're
[1:09:55] going to do do you know what to do
[1:09:59] that's the that's the question god bless
[1:10:00] you tonight let's all stand how the

[1:15:30] had
[1:15:31] he was poor and
[1:15:33] she said you know welfare had to come
[1:15:35] check on her find out what her situation
[1:15:37] was
[1:15:40] they said you know she had a son that
[1:15:43] had sent her those
[1:15:45] little
[1:15:46] pretty pictures that she said the
[1:15:48] prettiest pictures
[1:15:50] but you know she needed she needed
[1:15:51] somebody to come
[1:15:54] it was like
[1:15:56] because you know she was starving to
[1:15:57] death and
[1:15:59] she was so needy
[1:16:02] but somebody come to check on her and
[1:16:03] said
[1:16:04] well can we see those pretty pictures
[1:16:08] and she went got our bible and she
[1:16:09] opened them up and started pulling out
[1:16:11] these pretty pictures
[1:16:14] and you know
[1:16:17] when they showed them
[1:16:19] he said what were they he said they were
[1:16:20] bank drafts
[1:16:21] [Music]
[1:16:24] and her son was in india and had
[1:16:27] converted all that money over and sent
[1:16:29] her all that stuff
[1:16:30] but she didn't recognize what she had
[1:16:35] what was so amazing is
[1:16:37] you know they asked her
[1:16:38] said you hear from your son it's like
[1:16:40] well if your son loved you and you had a
[1:16:43] need it seemed like he would take care
[1:16:45] of you and she's like
[1:16:46] well i'm so embarrassed to ask you

[1:18:57] the one that caused the problem
[1:19:00] i don't want to be the one to have to
[1:19:01] stand up and give an account that
[1:19:03] somebody didn't get their healing
[1:19:04] because of me
[1:19:10] but you know what he's he's brought all
