[6:14] you realize that people that have that
[6:15] much hardware in their arm don't move it

[6:37] know he said you know we leave it in
[6:39] God's name I can only do so much but it

[9:52] commit it to you in the name of Jesus
[9:53] Christ we pray amen amen
[9:57] a little bit lengthy reading here Acts
[10:02] chapter 4 beginning in verse 1 it says
[10:04] and they spake unto the people the
[10:08] priests and the captain of the temple
[10:10] and the safeties came upon them being
[10:14] grieved that they taught the people and
[10:16] preached through Jesus the resurrection
[10:20] from the dead and they laid hands on
[10:21] them and put them and hold until the
[10:23] next day that was even howbeit many of
[10:29] them which heard the word believed and
[10:30] the number of men was about five
[10:32] thousand and it came to pass on the
[10:35] morrow that their rulers and elders and
[10:38] scribes and and us the high priest in
[10:41] caphis and john and alexander and many
[10:44] as were of the kindred of the high
[10:46] priests were gathered together at
[10:47] jerusalem and when they had set them in
[10:50] the midst they asked by what power or
[10:53] ber what name have you done this then
[10:56] Peter filled with the Holy go
[10:57] said unto them ye rulers of the people
[11:00] and elders of Israel if we this day be
[11:03] examined of the good deed done to this
[11:06] infinite men but what means he has made
[11:09] whole be it known unto you all and to
[11:13] all the people of Israel that by the
[11:15] name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom
[11:18] you crucified whom God raised from the
[11:20] dead even by him doth this man stand
[11:22] here before you whole this is the stone
[11:25] which was set at nought of you builders
[11:27] which has become the head of the corner
[11:30] neither is there salvation in any other
[11:33] for there is none other name under
[11:35] heaven given among men whereby we must
[11:38] be saved now when they saw the boldness
[11:41] of Peter and John and perceived that
[11:43] they were unlearned and ignorant men
[11:45] they marveled and they took knowledge of
[11:48] them that they had been with Jesus and
[11:50] beholding the men which was healed
[11:52] standing with them they could not say
[11:54] nothing against it but when they had
[11:57] commanded them to go aside out of the
[11:59] council they convert among themselves
[12:01] saying what shall we do to these men for
[12:05] that indeed a notable miracle hath been
[12:08] done by them is manifest to all them
[12:11] that dwell in Jerusalem and we cannot
[12:13] deny it but that it spread no further
[12:16] among the people let us straightly
[12:18] threatening the threaten them that they
[12:20] that they speak henceforth to no man in
[12:24] his name in this name amen god bless you
[12:28] tonight you may be seated you know we uh
[12:38] probably very familiar with this
[12:40] scripture but you know when you Peter
[12:45] and John you know when they were on
[12:48] their way to the temple that day to pray
[12:51] you know there was a man standing there
[12:55] who had a real need you know this this
[12:59] lame man had been lame all of his life
[13:01] here he was laying at the temple and you
[13:03] know he had his eyes on one thing and
[13:05] that was alms and he was just wanting
[13:08] something from the people but you know
[13:10] Peter came that day and you know Peter
[13:12] and John as they came that day Peter had
[13:15] something better than what it would then
[13:17] what you know what he was looking for
[13:19] you know he came and he said silver and
[13:24] gold have I none you know he didn't he
[13:26] didn't have what what this man was
[13:28] expecting but you know he said silver
[13:30] and gold have I none but such as I have
[13:33] give I be in the name of Jesus Christ
[13:35] rise up and walk and you know and then
[13:38] you know he just stood there I guess he
[13:40] was kind of startled at Peter's response
[13:42] to him because you know he's expecting
[13:44] something put in his little tin cup
[13:46] they're waiting on you know just the
[13:47] same old thing trying to get a little
[13:49] something but you know when when Peter
[13:52] spoke to him and said you know this is
[13:54] what I have you to Peter grabbed ahold
[13:55] of him by the hand because even if the
[13:57] man didn't have faith to believe that
[13:59] Peter had faith to believe he was going
[14:00] to be healed you know Peter grabbed
[14:03] ahold of him and pulled him up and the
[14:04] man got faith because I believe he
[14:06] understood and believed what Peter had
[14:08] to say that he believed in when he got
[14:10] hold then you know he stood on his feet
[14:13] but you know you know the the Pharisees
[14:16] and the scribes is in our scripture
[14:18] reading you know they were all upset
[14:20] that something had taken place you know
[14:22] and here it was you know this man and
[14:25] what was so striking about this
[14:27] scripture that we were reading is you
[14:29] know he stood in the midst of them and
[14:31] said they couldn't say anything about it
[14:34] because they knew this man had laid in
[14:36] the gate of beautiful and had laid there
[14:38] and they had walked right past him and
[14:40] everybody had seen him standing there
[14:42] begging alms of him and as he were
[14:45] staying you know sitting there begging
[14:46] alms and yet this man was standing on
[14:49] there
[14:49] feet standing in their midst you know
[14:54] Peter says you if you're going to
[14:56] examine us if you're going to question
[14:59] us about what we've done they will tell
[15:01] you you know because Jesus because if
[15:04] you're ascribing a Pharisee if you're if
[15:07] you followed anything then you would
[15:08] have known that Jesus walked on the face
[15:10] of the earth you would have known
[15:12] Jesus's ministry and why because Jesus
[15:15] done the same thing Jesus went about
[15:17] doing good casting out Devils and
[15:19] healing the sick he came to do exactly
[15:23] what the father has showed him to do
[15:25] fulfilling the scripture fulfilling the
[15:29] Old Testament the prophecies that were
[15:31] laid out there he was he came because
[15:33] that's what he came to fulfill make it
[15:35] make known to the people the Old
[15:36] Testament prophecies and he came in here
[15:39] he come and then what What did he say
[15:41] because the word that I want to look at
[15:44] tonight
[15:45] it's confirmation what was what was
[15:47] given what was that what was the
[15:48] confirmation because jesus said you know
[15:51] when he told the disciples he said he
[15:54] said the things that I do he said you
[15:55] shall do also he said in greater works
[15:59] the knees the works that I do the things
[16:02] that you see done he said you're going
[16:04] to do the same thing and you know even
[16:06] went before they had received the Holy
[16:08] Ghost he sent them out and was able to
[16:10] do the miracles but it wasn't just the
[16:12] miracles and the things he was preaching
[16:14] the word to him he wanted him to have
[16:16] their faith on the word he wanted him to
[16:18] see the word and that's exactly what he
[16:23] was telling the scribes and the
[16:24] Pharisees you've studied the word you
[16:26] studied the word you know all about it
[16:28] but the problem is is you don't see the
[16:29] fulfillment of it you don't see that
[16:32] it's being confirmed in front of you all
[16:34] the way through the scripture you know
[16:35] there's two people not only this the
[16:39] light man but you know Lazarus we read
[16:42] about the story of Lazarus and you know
[16:44] there he was and you know the scripture
[16:46] tells us that when when Lazarus was with
[16:48] Jesus and in the book of John he tells
[16:52] us that when Lazarus was there he was
[16:54] eating with Jesus and he said many
[16:56] people came to see not just see Jesus
[16:59] but they come to see Lazarus
[17:01] they come to see Lazarus sitting in
[17:03] their midst and you know he said he said
[17:06] the scribes and the Pharisees even took
[17:08] it upon themselves to think that they
[17:10] might kill Lazarus why because he was
[17:12] such a witness here we hear you us and
[17:19] you know he's sitting there you know no
[17:21] doubt all of these people who knew
[17:23] Lazarus because of a bit of his job
[17:26] being a scribe early most people would
[17:28] have known Lazarus they would have known
[17:30] his sisters they would have known all of
[17:32] this no doubt many of them had seen
[17:36] Lazarus laid in a tomb lady laying sick
[17:40] in the house and everybody's waiting on
[17:42] Jesus they're waiting on Jesus to come
[17:48] but Jesus don't come well maybe Jesus
[17:55] will come soon and they're waiting on
[17:57] Jesus to come but Jesus don't come he's
[18:01] got other he's got other itineraries to
[18:03] meet he's going other places why but he
[18:07] but he had a plan why because he was
[18:10] doing exactly what the father had showed
[18:11] him to do he said the son can do nothing
[18:14] in himself except what the father said
[18:17] what he sees the father do
[18:18] he said the sunders black was so when
[18:21] he's seen those things he went about he
[18:23] went around he didn't go and his
[18:27] heartbroken sisters there as they watch
[18:29] his what's their brother died and they
[18:33] bury him in a tomb and no doubt all
[18:35] these other people are watching you know
[18:38] what this is a great family these are
[18:39] people that loved Jesus he's well
[18:41] beloved here you know they can all talk
[18:43] about Jesus everything and you know what
[18:45] he could have come and healed him we've
[18:47] seen that we've seen him heal other
[18:48] people but he lets Lazarus died and they
[18:51] go who watched him
[18:52] what's his sister's cry over his body as
[18:54] they put him in a tomb it where's the
[18:57] loving Lord Jesus where's the tender
[18:59] Lord Jesus where is he now but he's
[19:01] letting water set in a tomb and then
[19:04] this one day this past and we hadn't
[19:07] seen Jesus in two days passes and we
[19:09] still don't see Jesus in three days pass
[19:12] and we still don't see Jesus where's gee
[19:14] so sad we think hope my heart's going to
[19:19] tear out why why is this going on
[19:21] where's Jesus than why Jesus not coming
[19:25] but Jesus came right on time Jesus had a
[19:30] plan there was a word to be fulfilled
[19:33] even when he come and easy go and said
[19:37] well you know if you could you know if
[19:38] he was just here you could have healed
[19:40] him but there was a greater miracle
[19:43] gonna take place there was a greater
[19:47] miracle going to take place and when
[19:50] they walked up there you know she was
[19:52] crying you know told Matt well Lord you
[19:56] know you know you can raise him he said
[20:00] I am the resurrection and the life I'm
[20:04] in the midst right now to raise him not
[20:07] some other time say it's an it's now's
[20:11] the time it's going to take place and
[20:15] then you know when he comes and goes to
[20:19] the tomb you know all the Pharisees in
[20:22] the Sadducees all the people that have
[20:26] seen Lazarus knew Lazarus grew up with
[20:30] him and sent him lay in that tomb and
[20:32] everybody had the same idea he's dead
[20:35] and his body's rotting and now Jesus
[20:42] shows up what's he going to do now we
[20:48] can do exactly what he said he was going
[20:49] to do he is the resurrection whatever
[20:53] the word said was going to take place
[20:55] and then went when they said roll the
[20:57] stone out of the way and he called
[20:59] Lazarus by name and he come forth and
[21:02] they said loosing here he was the man of
[21:06] the day had seen all this stuff take
[21:08] place that a man had died and had been
[21:10] rose from the dead raised from the dead
[21:12] and he was in their midst and yet they
[21:20] couldn't believe it why because it hurt
[21:22] their doctrine
[21:24] it hurt their prison you know their
[21:26] place position their prestige but you
[21:33] know here he was standing raised from
[21:35] the day and they wanted to get rid of
[21:36] him why because they couldn't see that
[21:39] God was in the midst well because they
[21:42] would they would have had to realize I'm
[21:44] wrong I've been wrong all this time I've
[21:47] had I've had my own ideas of my own
[21:49] thoughts and how men has taken the Word
[21:53] of God and they've created their own
[21:55] little doctrine and their own little
[21:56] schemes and all kinds of stuff that you
[21:58] know it wouldn't but when Jesus came on
[22:00] the scene and done the work of God and
[22:02] said prove me by the scripture where I
[22:04] didn't do what exactly what I was what
[22:06] the Bible says that I would do when they
[22:09] come in question him he took them right
[22:10] back to what you said you've studied
[22:13] what you've read what you know what they
[22:15] said
[22:16] well this isn't exactly this he brought
[22:20] him right back to the scripture said
[22:23] show me where I where I hadn't believed
[22:25] where I hadn't fulfilled the word and
[22:28] here he is standing standing in their
[22:31] midst confirmation of the word one
[22:36] because that was confirmation but he
[22:41] asked him said can you believe his up to
[22:44] them can you believe you say that you
[22:47] say that you're Abraham's descendants
[22:50] and that you're Moses disciples when
[22:52] what he did Moses say what did Abraham
[22:54] say what was their faith he said if
[22:57] you'd have known them you know me you
[22:59] didn't own my day you didn't own your
[23:01] day of visitation would you what they
[23:06] missed their day of visitation and there
[23:13] he was
[23:15] Lazarus standing in their midst
[23:18] fulfilling the word they had nothing
[23:20] they could say about it no we just got
[23:22] to get rid of the evidence we got to get
[23:25] rid of that evidence we don't want
[23:28] anybody hanging around Jesus when the
[23:31] lame man was raised and those Peter and
[23:33] John they were saying telling them how
[23:35] you can't tell anybody about what
[23:38] you got to go into synagogues and tell
[23:40] all the people don't don't say anything
[23:42] about this lame man it's late in the
[23:44] gate beautiful all these years that is
[23:45] dead and he's walking around now don't
[23:47] you go around telling what happened
[23:52] y'all take that lame man get him on the
[23:54] fastest ship out of town or on the
[23:56] fastest chariot out of town because we
[23:58] don't want nobody around talking about
[23:59] it don't talk about it but you know what
[24:06] the more the more that they tried to
[24:08] cover it up and tried to hide it and
[24:10] tried to whitewash it and everything
[24:12] like that you know the greater it became
[24:15] it's like well why are you trying to
[24:17] hide it why because there was something
[24:21] there that that they didn't like why
[24:24] because it rubbed them the wrong way it
[24:26] went against their doctrine in the same
[24:32] way it is today confirmation of the word
[24:35] why because the word is being confirmed
[24:38] God is making his word known today he's
[24:41] confirming his word today just like it
[24:45] was back then he's making itself known
[24:53] you know all through the scripture we
[24:55] see there's people that God is trying
[24:57] that you know in all these different
[24:58] situations God wanted people to confirm
[25:01] his word you know you look at all the
[25:06] different people that went through all
[25:08] these different situations that they had
[25:10] to go through in their lives you know
[25:13] what God was confirming the word to him
[25:16] you know Jairus you know when his
[25:20] daughter was sick you know you know he
[25:22] believed on Jesus but you know what he
[25:23] didn't want he didn't want anybody to
[25:25] know where he stood he didn't want
[25:28] anybody knowing what he believed but you
[25:32] know what God wanted him to show his
[25:35] colors show his true colors wanted him
[25:37] to know everybody to see who he was and
[25:41] when it's it when his daughter got sick
[25:43] you know when it came in there was no
[25:45] other help there was no other solution
[25:47] there was nothing else that's going to
[25:49] fix it you know he had to go to G
[25:51] but you know he got to a place when he
[25:53] got desperate you know it didn't matter
[25:55] what anybody thought or what was going
[25:57] on he wanted Jesus and because he knew
[26:00] what Jesus could do and you know it's
[26:02] the same way you know God puts us in
[26:04] situations sometimes they look helpless
[26:07] and hopeless but you know what God wills
[26:09] us to show our true colors God wills us
[26:12] to be in a situation you know that we
[26:14] can step out in faith and believe what
[26:16] what is there we have to we have to
[26:20] stand here and claim what's ours this is
[26:29] from the message spiritual amnesia
[26:31] brother Branham says he was talking
[26:35] about the Thoroughbred he said but I
[26:36] like a genuine thoroughbred
[26:38] so he's gentle you can talk between me
[26:40] knows who his papa was who his mama was
[26:44] who his grandpa grandma was he's got
[26:46] pedigree papers to show where he came
[26:48] from he said I like a pedigree a
[26:51] pedigreed Christian that can go all the
[26:54] way back to the Word of God to the day
[26:55] of Pentecost and identify themselves
[26:57] there with the Saints where the power of
[27:00] the Holy Ghost came upon them
[27:01] that's a pedigreed Christian he knows
[27:04] where he come from he's not identified
[27:06] with Memphis Baptist or int or nothing
[27:08] else or any kind of other stuff that
[27:10] goes around the message because you know
[27:16] they've just carried all that other
[27:17] stuff over into the end of the message
[27:19] they're still Methodists and Baptists
[27:21] and all of that they just go by
[27:24] different names he's identified in God's
[27:27] Word he knows exactly where he is
[27:29] standing at the royal blood of his
[27:31] father flows through him the blood of
[27:33] Jesus Christ he knows what it does he
[27:36] believes every word God works through
[27:38] him and confirms it with the signs that
[27:40] he fought he promised to follow
[27:43] he hasn't got no spiritual amnesia he's
[27:46] a genuine thoroughbred I like that so
[27:54] God wants us in a situation to show who
[27:56] we are because if we know who we are
[27:58] then we don't mind sharing it because
[28:01] you know the one thing about Peter and
[28:03] John you know they know who they
[28:05] they knew where they were standing and
[28:06] you know they marveled at their boldness
[28:09] they marveled at the boldness that they
[28:12] had and you and I we have to be the same
[28:14] way you know take God at His Word be
[28:21] bold you know somebody asked me the
[28:26] other day asked me about you know what
[28:29] does it mean to take God at His Word how
[28:34] would you translate that I told him I
[28:40] told him I said well the first thing off
[28:42] is whatever he said is true the Bible
[28:47] says that let every man be be a liar and
[28:49] God be true I said whatever he said in
[28:52] the past in the present in the future
[28:55] it's all it's all true it's all settled
[28:58] in heaven and don't matter what it is I
[29:00] said because the more science has tried
[29:03] to prove the Bible wrong the more
[29:04] they've proved it right I said it
[29:07] doesn't matter I said because you no
[29:09] matter what's taking place I said
[29:11] because we can put our confidence in
[29:13] what was said in in the Old Testament
[29:15] and what went on whether whether we
[29:18] could prove it or not it's still it's
[29:20] still the truth and it's just like it
[29:23] doesn't matter what if whatever it says
[29:24] in the Bible it don't matter what
[29:26] science tells me this is the truth and
[29:28] this is what I'm going to stand on one
[29:32] of the calls it's it's it's settled in
[29:34] me that this is the truth and I don't
[29:38] have to worry about what somebody says
[29:39] well this is wrong and that's wrong no I
[29:41] can tell you that it's the truth and
[29:43] every time this went through
[29:45] historically we've seen it take place
[29:47] but you know what it only it's taking
[29:48] place in my life that I've seen it real
[29:51] what it says in the scripture takes
[29:52] place and you know it doesn't matter
[29:55] what anybody else says I can prove it
[29:56] because I'm a witness I'm on my own
[30:00] witness so whatever he said it's true
[30:06] because the more people have tried to
[30:09] prove it wrong and tear it down and try
[30:11] to bring out all the mistakes the more
[30:13] they prove it right and so whatever he
[30:17] has said in the past
[30:18] it's true the problem is is man has got
[30:22] it mixed up not God God's not confused
[30:25] and on his word I said but man's kid
[30:27] gets confused on his own work whether
[30:32] God created in seven days seven thousand
[30:35] years if it took ten million years or
[30:38] whatever else you know what God created
[30:41] it and whether or whether everybody
[30:44] tries to believe that God created or it
[30:47] came from a Big Bang it came from you
[30:49] know however you want to look at it I
[30:50] believe God spoke it into existence and
[30:53] it came whether it took because I
[30:56] believe it started just as soon as God
[30:58] thought it and spoke it it came into
[31:00] existence but I already believed that it
[31:02] was in the existence in God's mind so it
[31:05] didn't matter when it came but it came
[31:06] into existence but you know what I don't
[31:09] believe that it was a whole bunch of
[31:10] just willy-nilly
[31:13] you know craziness you know just some
[31:16] haphazard thing that took place that
[31:18] some of the lightning struck a pool
[31:19] somewhere and all of a sudden life
[31:21] started and you know we all descended
[31:26] from monkeys and everything like that
[31:28] but you know they tell you something
[31:29] brothers and sisters you know what it
[31:31] almost be good sometimes that we did
[31:33] come from monkeys because we could
[31:34] revert them back to their ancestors
[31:37] because they act better the grown people
[31:39] do today we got human beings that don't
[31:47] even act like human beings but you know
[31:52] what it's all settled it doesn't matter
[31:54] what took place it's forever settled and
[31:57] it happened just exactly the way God
[31:59] said it took place you know what
[32:01] whatever took place it still happens
[32:03] today God spoke it and instead it came
[32:06] into being I believe that was a creative
[32:09] evolution that took place as God was
[32:11] speaking it come more and more in
[32:14] greater and greater and greater if I see
[32:16] reason that you and I are created in His
[32:18] image because it was God speaking it but
[32:23] it didn't it didn't just haphazardly God
[32:25] wasn't confused on anything well I would
[32:27] like like people get confused on God
[32:29] didn't ever get confused on nothing
[32:31] I ain't never been worried about nothing
[32:33] God ain't ever been scared about nothing
[32:35] because you know what there's nothing to
[32:37] does ever happen anytime anyplace
[32:39] anywhere that God didn't know about
[32:41] ahead of time then we get confused and
[32:47] we get scared and we get worried and
[32:49] always but you know worried ain't never
[32:51] produced one thing that's been been
[32:53] worth anything it's not produced one
[32:54] virtue in anything anybody worry don't
[32:58] do you any bit of good what because the
[33:02] only thing that God came from it came
[33:04] from God was faith and power and love
[33:07] and a sound mind that's what came from
[33:09] God and that's what he gave to you in
[33:11] the new birth but see the thing is is we
[33:15] still get confused why because we're
[33:16] still living an old past house and we
[33:18] still lean on the sole flesh we still
[33:20] like this old flesh get in the way but
[33:23] you know what God has given us the power
[33:25] to overcome this whatever he said is
[33:29] true and it's ever it's forever settled
[33:34] the problem is is it it's got to be
[33:36] settled in you you got to believe that
[33:38] you got to come to that place so
[33:44] whatever he said and whatever he said
[33:45] he's going to do he's going to do it all
[33:50] you got to do is come to the same place
[33:52] to believe it and claim it and it'll
[33:55] come to pass why because the scripture
[34:00] tells us that God had two immutable
[34:02] things that he could that he couldn't
[34:04] tell a lie and his word was true and he
[34:07] spoke it and when he had no knowing
[34:09] greater he swore by himself that he
[34:11] would fulfill his own word and brother
[34:16] Branham said that if then if you come on
[34:18] the scene and you have the same faith
[34:20] that anybody else had that you've ever
[34:22] done it before and you come to the same
[34:24] situation you come to the same condition
[34:27] and have same faith and God does not
[34:30] meet your need does not come and act the
[34:33] same way he's done in the past he said
[34:35] you can call him on the scene and call
[34:37] him a liar why because he called but you
[34:43] know what in the scripture he said he
[34:44] wanted some
[34:45] by the believing take me at my word take
[34:48] me at my word all the way through the
[34:50] scripture he was wanting to find
[34:52] somebody that believing and if you just
[34:56] believe him
[34:57] you know he'll come and do it you know
[35:00] what he has more desired to bless you
[35:02] then you want to be blessed yourself he
[35:08] said he wanted to give us the Holy Ghost
[35:10] more than we wanted to ourselves he
[35:13] wanted to heal us more than we want to
[35:15] be healed ourselves sometimes that's
[35:20] hard to believe but you know what he has
[35:25] a desire for us he has something he
[35:29] wants to give us he wants to bless us
[35:33] but we've got to believe that we've got
[35:38] to believe what the Bible says is true
[35:40] and you've got to put your claim on that
[35:46] you know there was a there was a brother
[35:48] preaching one time and he and he made it
[35:50] comment and I've got a well brother
[35:53] brems
[35:53] has more than one quote on it but you
[35:55] know brother brems said that some people
[35:57] in this world don't dream he said that
[36:00] sometimes people's subconscious and you
[36:03] know there's such deep sleepers or
[36:04] subconscious is separated and everything
[36:06] you know they don't ever dream and he
[36:09] had a had a woman in the church come up
[36:10] to him says well you know my saw and my
[36:12] psychology professor told us that
[36:14] everybody dreams you just don't remember
[36:15] it and he said well sister brother
[36:18] branham's said the Prophet said some
[36:20] people don't drink gee I wonder who I'm
[36:22] going to believe jail wonder who I'm
[36:30] supposed to believe the Prophet or you
[36:32] some psychology professor yeah it's
[36:38] ridiculous if somebody even think that
[36:41] you know people people like you know
[36:44] well it's we ran about it
[36:46] well what brother madam say what does
[36:47] the Bible say people get confused on
[36:52] stuff you know
[36:57] you get everybody you know they get all
[36:59] wrapped up in politics and working on
[37:01] one side working on the other and trying
[37:02] to figure this out and that out and
[37:06] rearranging the deck furniture on the
[37:08] Titanic you ain't going to change
[37:12] nothing you try to talk to people about
[37:18] getting saved and getting filled with
[37:20] the Holy Ghost and getting to a place
[37:21] that you know you have a relationship
[37:23] with God and know where you're going
[37:25] when you die and they look at you
[37:29] cross-eyed working with a working with a
[37:33] guy today works for a heating and air
[37:35] company and he come I was checking on
[37:38] one of our units we had some problems
[37:40] with and he said you know he just you
[37:42] know just the nominal Christian he said
[37:45] you know he said if people would just
[37:46] get excited about Jesus the way people
[37:49] get excited about ball games and TV
[37:51] shows and all this other stuff and you
[37:53] know they were talking about some some
[37:55] TV show that you know one of the
[37:56] characters is is leaving and everything
[37:58] like yeah and you know I mean this you
[38:00] know the ratings just blew up because
[38:02] you know everybody had to tune in to
[38:03] watch this one person on TV well it's
[38:08] fake
[38:09] [Laughter]
[38:12] [Applause]
[38:13] but you know what everybody's so in tune
[38:16] to this we got to figure this out it's
[38:19] ridiculous let me tell you something
[38:23] there's a plan of salvation you know
[38:25] what the god of our the created
[38:28] everything that you've ever seen that
[38:30] you cannot see that put everything in
[38:32] motion you know what he came down from
[38:34] the ramparts of glory and step down into
[38:37] human flesh
[38:38] and died on a cross so do you could
[38:40] receive eternal life that's the greatest
[38:47] love story ever told that's the greatest
[38:49] news story ever told but you try to tell
[38:51] somebody about it you know it's not just
[38:59] some just some thoughts some ideas some
[39:01] craziness that went on but it's a fact
[39:06] let me tell you something when you get
[39:08] into place where you don't know what to
[39:10] do and you don't know where to turn and
[39:12] all of a sudden there's an anchor that
[39:14] holds you in that time let me tell you
[39:16] something that's a great place to be I
[39:18] thank God for that
[39:22] you know one time I had a kidney stone
[39:25] and well they thought was a kidney stone
[39:27] I don't know I was about ready to pass
[39:29] out all I know I was hurting so bad I
[39:30] couldn't think straight I squatted down
[39:34] and for fortunately I had one of my
[39:37] co-workers come to me and I was ready to
[39:39] fall in the floor and I didn't know how
[39:41] much longer I was going to be here I was
[39:45] fading fast and he'd come over to me but
[39:48] you know I got to a place that you know
[39:49] at that moment I had the greatest peace
[39:52] in the world something just come to me
[39:55] and you know what I didn't matter if I
[39:56] died at that moment I had I had Jesus on
[39:59] my side I had something to hold me in
[40:02] that time and you know people people you
[40:04] know they want it they want to hold on
[40:06] to something they want to hold on to
[40:07] some kind of idea or some kind of you
[40:10] know Creed or whatever but you know they
[40:13] come to a place where just like that
[40:14] woman - brother Graham talked about you
[40:15] know the Sunday school teacher you know
[40:17] she lived all her life and held on to
[40:20] what somebody had told her but she had
[40:21] never got to the place that she had put
[40:23] an anchor down herself and got got
[40:26] tie post tied where she was anchored to
[40:28] something and when she come to meet the
[40:31] angel of death when death come in the
[40:33] door she was like you're a deceiver
[40:35] you're a liar
[40:36] because you've told me I'm right and I'm
[40:38] done and on my way to hell
[40:43] see that's that's the time to know you
[40:46] got to know that you know that you know
[40:47] why because you never know when it's
[40:49] going to take place none of us are
[40:54] promised tomorrow we're actually not
[40:56] even promised the rest of this evening
[41:01] but we've got to know that we know that
[41:04] we are in him not just waiting on
[41:12] something but let's be in him let's be
[41:15] in Christ there's a place to be that's
[41:26] where I want to be I want to make sure
[41:27] that I am in there and I want to be
[41:29] everything I can in any M not just some
[41:37] idea not some thought but I want a true
[41:40] revelation of that you know you know we
[41:46] have to have a place that we come to
[41:47] that we have this confirmation of who we
[41:50] are a realization of who we are you know
[41:54] many times people have come through and
[41:56] you know they they think they think they
[41:59] have something but you know what they've
[42:01] not sold out they've not emptied
[42:04] themselves out brother Brent said you
[42:08] know that's what he was what he was
[42:10] looking for was empty vessels that he
[42:12] could feel you know there there was an
[42:16] old saying that said God never turns us
[42:18] away empty unless we're full of
[42:20] ourselves so we've got to come to a
[42:24] place that we can empty out ourselves
[42:27] that we can empty out and put everything
[42:30] behind us
[42:31] let God kill us empty us out but God
[42:37] take and do the work that he wants to do
[42:40] that he can mold us and take his his
[42:43] image and mode us and so that we're like
[42:45] him not try to fit the word to us but
[42:49] the word fits us that he molds us to
[42:53] what we need to be that we're impede out
[42:58] you know people people are so confused
[43:03] on so many things you know with Rosedale
[43:07] has been preaching on the new birth you
[43:08] know and it so is so it'll talk and you
[43:12] know people people don't even understand
[43:13] and you know because it's so because
[43:15] people have gotten to the point now
[43:17] where you know that's so below us one
[43:21] because that's the greatest thing that
[43:22] you can come to and the problem is as
[43:25] people people have devalued it and just
[43:27] and just absolutely made it worthless
[43:29] because you know because you know you
[43:32] know because well I was just born this
[43:33] way and so the problem is it is the data
[43:39] they don't see that you know what they
[43:41] were born in sin shaping in iniquity
[43:43] they come in this world dead and I
[43:46] alienated from the plan of God from the
[43:48] life of God and there's got to be a way
[43:50] made across that chasm that you can come
[43:53] into his presence but wonder what is the
[43:56] problem nobody wants to do that nobody
[43:59] wants to die nobody will say empty
[44:01] themselves out it would when you know
[44:10] brother I'm telling that story about the
[44:11] man you know where do you want to go
[44:14] he's telling Moses the the the man was
[44:18] talking to Mose you know you were
[44:19] spilled and he said you know I want to
[44:22] receive the Holy Ghost he won't know
[44:24] where you go well come on I'll show you
[44:26] where you go go out here in the Pigpen
[44:29] guy here in the muck and the mire and
[44:32] all of that oh I can get out there in
[44:35] that well you don't want it bad enough
[44:38] just like a man said you know he told
[44:40] the Lord said you know he said if you
[44:42] don't you know fill me with the Holy
[44:43] Ghost you gonna find a pile of bones
[44:45] laying in this field I'm gonna stay
[44:46] right here till I get what I want you
[44:51] know do we sell out to that you're not
[44:56] thinking about Hannah when she went into
[44:57] the temple that day and stood there and
[44:59] you know who is Eli whoever it was was
[45:02] standing there and you know he thought
[45:04] she was drunk and she was in there
[45:06] praying and seeking God's face why
[45:09] because there was a rebuke on her there
[45:11] was there was an innocent girl it was
[45:13] such a disgrace and her time to be
[45:16] childless and she said there and being
[45:19] childless and she went in there he said
[45:21] Lord can you remove the reproach off of
[45:23] me
[45:25] she didn't care what anybody thought of
[45:28] her what she looked like why because she
[45:30] was praying to God that he would do
[45:31] something for her and wondering if we
[45:34] ever get to the place that we don't care
[45:35] what people think about us and what
[45:37] people look and see but if we could just
[45:39] get in between us and God and we just
[45:42] come together and get in that place
[45:44] where you can speak to us people don't
[45:47] know what prayer is you know I preached
[45:51] about that to myself sometimes you know
[45:52] why is it because prayers and just
[45:54] talking to God that's what we want to do
[45:56] we will talk to God but that's not the
[46:00] whole thing
[46:01] when does God talk to you can you
[46:07] imagine going to a school going into
[46:09] school and you sit there and you're a
[46:11] chatterbox the whole time go to a
[46:14] classroom set and dance and you run your
[46:16] mouth the whole time
[46:17] chatterbox chatterbox interrupts the
[46:19] teacher everybody like it and then you
[46:20] get done and say you know what that
[46:22] teachers worthless he don't teach me
[46:23] nothing well if you'd sit down and keep
[46:27] your mouth closed and take some notes or
[46:29] something maybe you'd learn something
[46:33] maybe the problem is is if we was talk
[46:36] to God say Lord speak to me and we stay
[46:39] there till we hear from God
[46:43] but we just want to talk to God we won't
[46:46] talk to God we want to act like we know
[46:47] what was going on but if we get to the
[46:52] place say Lord just let me just double
[46:54] stay right here till you tell me what I
[46:56] need and people wonder why can people
[47:00] get into conditions they do
[47:01] why because sometimes things happen to
[47:03] us so God can talk to us we wonder what
[47:08] we get in conditions situations we
[47:11] wonder and then God will come on the
[47:13] scene and talk to us you know it's just
[47:18] like it's just like raising children you
[47:21] have you have children and you can try
[47:24] to talk to him and talk to him but
[47:25] sometimes you got to get their attention
[47:26] I had a had a friend of mine his mom his
[47:37] mama dead they fostered they adopted
[47:40] three and I probably over 30 they
[47:44] fostered and Mizzell angel' had a sayin
[47:51] she said a child's brains leak out of
[47:55] their head but they leak into their seat
[47:58] and she said it takes sufficient and
[48:03] repeated pressure to their posterior and
[48:07] that forces all their brains back into
[48:09] their head and she said that's the
[48:14] problem with a lot of kids they walk
[48:17] around here and they got an attitude why
[48:19] because all our brains are in their seat
[48:22] and what happens we will people get in
[48:26] the same way God tries to talk to him
[48:29] why because all their brains are in
[48:31] their seat like that man said people we
[48:37] got Christians that act like Missouri
[48:38] mules hard-headed as a day is long and
[48:42] they and God has to hit him with a
[48:43] two-by-four and then I started saying he
[48:45] touched me whoa he touched me why
[48:50] because he's got to get your attention
[48:54] and many times we just want to talk to
[48:56] God but we don't him talking to us well
[49:00] because that's what he said prayers are
[49:02] not just talking and I just say in words
[49:04] but it's communion than what is
[49:05] communion this conversation is
[49:07] back-and-forth we do may have to make
[49:12] our positions though but the Bible said
[49:14] that he knows our needs before we ever
[49:16] ask her pray for but do we have we ever
[49:21] sat down in the quad in the night or
[49:23] whenever it is and sit there and say
[49:25] Lord speak to me you know I went to a
[49:30] meeting one time and you know I prayed I
[49:31] said lord I would really love to hear
[49:36] from you tonight just speak something to
[49:38] me that touches me I don't care if it
[49:42] touches nobody else in the play place I
[49:44] want to be touched tonight I want
[49:46] something that speaks to me speaks to my
[49:48] heart and you know I sat down brother
[49:51] Wade and in that meeting I go any
[49:54] honestly it felt like if the brother had
[49:57] a sat down beside me in the pew and said
[50:00] Aaron this is this this is this and he
[50:04] would have called my name and said it
[50:05] hey if it is set right beside me he
[50:07] couldn't have told me any more he did
[50:09] but he didn't call my name and he
[50:11] probably didn't even know he was
[50:12] preaching to me but it spoke to my heart
[50:14] and it just overflowed me but you know I
[50:17] walked out of that same building and
[50:19] there was people sitting in the parking
[50:20] lot well you know he said this and he
[50:23] said that well I didn't like this and I
[50:25] didn't like that and he should have said
[50:27] it this way and he should have said it
[50:28] that way and I was like what did y'all
[50:33] come to church for I've never seen
[50:39] anybody so critical in my life and I was
[50:41] just I just had to walk away I was like
[50:44] it doesn't matter because you know what
[50:46] if you'd have gone in the same mine that
[50:48] I was seeing and it don't make me
[50:50] anything but you know what I believe God
[50:52] spoke to me that night and you know what
[50:56] that's not happening every time but I
[50:57] tell you what
[50:58] hey if either sat down beside me and
[51:00] called my name and told me he could have
[51:02] done any more than what he was doing
[51:03] behind the pulpit but you know anything
[51:05] is as people say well you know everybody
[51:07] gets a little critical about this a
[51:08] little bit that well you know what
[51:09] that's what they came for whatever you
[51:11] come to church for tonight you're gonna
[51:12] get if you if you want to find something
[51:15] to build criticize you'll find something
[51:16] to criticize but if you want to find
[51:18] something that's going to bless you and
[51:19] go to draw you closer to God then you
[51:21] can find it but what you're looking for
[51:30] potestas God has it out there for all of
[51:34] us I think I've told you before about
[51:39] the newspaper editor you know that the
[51:41] man was right wrote him in gave him all
[51:43] of their all their mistakes in the
[51:45] newspaper the editor wrote him back and
[51:47] told him said well thank you sir in our
[51:50] in our paper we put something in there
[51:53] for everybody so you know we decided to
[51:55] you know we put in all these mistakes in
[51:57] there so you could find them so we're so
[51:59] glad to help you out in that yeah so if
[52:03] you're looking for mistakes and bolts
[52:05] where you'll find them but sometimes if
[52:10] you're smart you'll find out then you
[52:13] got more than a lot of other folks do
[52:14] you know if you want to find folks you
[52:17] always find your own got a lot more than
[52:22] trying to find somebody else's and point
[52:24] fingers and all these type things but
[52:29] are we looking to find God or we just
[52:31] kind of find fault
[52:33] we're looking for something from God is
[52:37] God there to meet our needs to fulfill
[52:43] what we what we have a desire for what
[52:46] is your desire tonight what is your what
[52:49] are you hungry and thirsting for because
[52:53] that's what we're looking because that's
[52:55] what God can that's all that he can do
[52:58] is meet your need whatever your
[53:00] confession is whatever you're looking
[53:02] for whatever your desiring for but can
[53:09] we but we do we find what we're looking
[53:11] for are we are we desiring for the
[53:14] things of God and even when when the
[53:19] things in our life go wrong
[53:21] you know you know many times people have
[53:23] have looked and you know they want
[53:25] things to be like this and they want
[53:26] things to be like that and you know and
[53:28] then when everything crashes down and
[53:30] said well that wasn't what I was looking
[53:31] for Lord but you know in the end it
[53:35] comes out exactly the way that God has
[53:38] it planned you know I told the story
[53:42] about and I like the story so you might
[53:45] remember it you might not some of you've
[53:46] heard it but you know the you know the
[53:49] man about pushing the boulder you know
[53:52] God told that man to push the boulder
[53:53] that time you know he's pushing that
[53:55] Boulder push the boulder so gonna he was
[53:59] pushing the boulder all the time pushing
[54:01] pushing pushing they every day pushing
[54:04] pushing pushing never couldn't move that
[54:05] Boulder and you know he just kept doing
[54:09] faithful pushing the boulder pushing the
[54:10] boulder and one day he told God he said
[54:13] God he said I'm a failure you know he
[54:16] said I just can't understand I'm pushing
[54:18] this boulder all the time and I'm moving
[54:19] it anywhere and God told him said I
[54:22] didn't tell you to move it I told you to
[54:23] push it he said but look at look at you
[54:29] look how you used to be
[54:31] what's either to see how you are today
[54:33] look at the muscles that you have the
[54:35] calluses look at you look how its
[54:37] defined you he said I never told you to
[54:39] move it I told you to push it well
[54:41] because the boulder wasn't for you to
[54:43] move the boulder was to make a
[54:44] difference in you and many times we have
[54:46] things in our life that come our way and
[54:48] we wonder why why things if God has
[54:50] allowed these things to happen and why
[54:52] we born the way that we're born you know
[54:57] some people some people are born you
[54:59] know people have have temper and you
[55:04] know they have all kinds of other things
[55:05] in their life that they inherit from
[55:06] other people and they wonder why they
[55:08] have sicknesses and all kinds of
[55:10] ailments and everything and it's like
[55:12] well you know you know this is the
[55:15] fourth fifth generation you know we've
[55:16] all had it
[55:17] we all suffer with it you know well you
[55:22] know what maybe it came down to you to
[55:26] put an end to it there's many people you
[55:31] know they've had many people you know
[55:33] where everybody's got
[55:35] heart disease and everybody's got
[55:36] everybody's diabetic and and everybody's
[55:38] got this and everybody's got that I
[55:41] think about brother Jill Forney you know
[55:43] he was in that doctor's office and he's
[55:44] saying all in pamphlets on the wall you
[55:46] know he was gonna go over and look at
[55:47] their thing and then you know he
[55:48] realized you know what that's not a
[55:50] faith he said God's healed me of that
[55:56] anyway back set out he said I wanna go
[55:57] read that why because that gets tough in
[56:01] your mind it's not built on faith you
[56:06] know everybody says well you got to go
[56:07] have this done your cholesterol all out
[56:10] of whack and do this and that you know
[56:11] the thing is is if we'd have more faith
[56:13] in what God said no no you know I'm not
[56:20] saying be stupid or shutting up
[56:22] shouldn't say that word well listen
[56:28] listen let's not act like we have a low
[56:29] IQ or you know like we've lost our minds
[56:33] or whatever hopefully hopefully that's
[56:36] better
[56:36] you know but you know I mean let you
[56:41] know just like brother Dale was saying
[56:42] you know I'll follow you I'll follow you
[56:44] plan I'll follow your plan but I gonna
[56:46] take you chemotherapy but you know the
[56:51] thing is is is people you know you say
[56:53] people you can't live just any old kind
[56:56] of way and expect things to work out
[56:58] right you know it's amazing they were
[57:02] there they done a study and you know one
[57:04] of the most problems that we have in in
[57:07] this world is as people have sleep
[57:09] deprivation people lack of sleep people
[57:13] have sleep apnea and many other ailments
[57:15] they caused them to like sleep do you
[57:17] know that it over long-term sleep loss
[57:21] if you go without sleep for a long time
[57:23] do you know what's it's your body
[57:24] because I'm not having rest your body
[57:27] will become diabetic they had people
[57:32] that stayed up and you know they were
[57:34] sleep deprived for a long time and you
[57:36] know what they were watching their blood
[57:38] sugar levels going up why because
[57:42] there's a time that your body's got to
[57:44] have rest and people say well you know
[57:48] I'm not
[57:49] want to do this I'm not gonna do that
[57:50] let me tell you something if you know
[57:52] what the old saying is if you're if you
[57:53] have problems and you got to count sheep
[57:55] then it's time to talk to the Shepherd
[57:59] there's a time that we've got to come to
[58:01] a place that we can find because you
[58:03] know what everybody's like well I went
[58:04] to this doctor in this specialist and
[58:06] he's gonna send me this specialist and I
[58:08] got nothing wrong with any of that but
[58:10] you know the thing is is I want to have
[58:11] my faith I want to have my diagnosis
[58:15] from the great physician why because he
[58:19] said by his stripes I'm healed then you
[58:21] know what that's what I want to hold on
[58:23] to long before any doctor tries to tell
[58:25] me I got this or that or I'm dying or
[58:27] any other kind of problem just like that
[58:33] doctor told that man one time and
[58:34] everybody tried to tell him you know you
[58:35] had all them kind of ailments and
[58:37] problems saying like it and it's like is
[58:40] there an expiration date on you
[58:42] somewhere we don't know so oh you know
[58:53] only God knows when you're going to war
[58:55] with us you know when your life is over
[58:57] with but you know what you can sit in
[58:58] and wear yourself to death but your
[59:04] brother Brad said you know there's
[59:05] people that you know they come in and
[59:07] then the doctor was saying you know if
[59:08] we can get them to believe that we can
[59:10] do something for them that there's a way
[59:12] that they can get better they'll get
[59:14] better but if they come in and they get
[59:17] in their mind that there's nothing that
[59:18] can be done and it's over with then
[59:22] they're done and it's same way with you
[59:26] and I it's whatever we have our mind on
[59:28] whatever we believe then they will take
[59:30] place God has a has a way for us a way
[59:35] mate and if we can believe in that then
[59:38] God can do something for us if we can
[59:42] just believe and I want to close here in
[59:49] a minute but you know
[59:55] if we if we can just hold on to God's
[59:58] Word what God has given us what God has
[1:00:02] showed us then you know what you know
[1:00:04] it'll come to the place that God is
[1:00:07] intended for it to come to if we can
[1:00:10] believe what God is seeing you know
[1:00:15] brother Brenda in the end the message
[1:00:17] perfect strength a perfect weakness
[1:00:19] brother branham's hey so he talks about
[1:00:21] Mary you know and all the things that
[1:00:24] Mary went through you know Mary had to
[1:00:28] believe in something that had never
[1:00:30] taken place Mary had to believe in a
[1:00:34] word that was spoken over 800 years
[1:00:37] before and there had been a lot of women
[1:00:40] born and a lot of children born but you
[1:00:44] know what there never had been a woman
[1:00:46] that can that had conceived and birth
[1:00:48] the child without knowing a man but it
[1:00:51] was written in the scripture and in all
[1:00:54] these years it just become just a ritual
[1:00:59] of reading a virgin shall conceive a
[1:01:02] virgin shall conceive and a child shall
[1:01:05] be born all these things that took place
[1:01:08] and here it wasn't just a just a ritual
[1:01:10] that went home but you know what there
[1:01:13] came a time when that had to be
[1:01:15] fulfilled and you know she had to
[1:01:19] believe in something that had never
[1:01:21] taken place didn't feel anything you
[1:01:24] know anything but she had it take the
[1:01:26] angel at his word and she had to wait
[1:01:29] for something to take place and then she
[1:01:33] had to continue with that month after
[1:01:36] month after month even when even when
[1:01:42] people who began to ridicule her all the
[1:01:45] things that she had to go through
[1:01:46] chariot carrying this child she brought
[1:01:51] forth a son even when everybody talked
[1:01:55] about her and said that she was no good
[1:01:57] and she's you know the worst kind of
[1:01:59] woman and everything like that and yet
[1:02:00] when she stood there and she took him
[1:02:04] into the temple for him to be
[1:02:05] circumcised and Simeon was
[1:02:07] waiting on that one to come to Kabul
[1:02:10] fill the word that he had been holding
[1:02:12] with holding on to all that time and
[1:02:15] when Anna the prophetess was there and
[1:02:17] she spoke over what was going to take
[1:02:19] place why'd he come to fulfill and here
[1:02:23] she was had this child she carried him
[1:02:28] all that time she'd mothered him she
[1:02:30] nursed him she fed him she clothed him
[1:02:32] everything that she had to do for him
[1:02:34] here he was hers she held on to this
[1:02:38] child and she carried him she took care
[1:02:43] of him and that was hers
[1:02:50] even even when she she lost him and she
[1:02:54] found him with this you know with the
[1:02:56] with the leaders and the scholars
[1:02:57] speaking on the word you know all the
[1:03:01] things that she had went through all of
[1:03:03] those years teaching the walk teaching
[1:03:06] him to write all the things that she had
[1:03:08] to do that a mother does taking care of
[1:03:10] him wiping his nose everything that she
[1:03:12] had to do for him she carried that child
[1:03:16] and that was her she raised him up and
[1:03:19] she held on to what the prophecy was
[1:03:22] fulfilled what the angel had told her of
[1:03:24] what he was what he was to do and you
[1:03:29] know there she was and then and then
[1:03:31] when he came in and he was out one day
[1:03:34] and John was in the water and he came
[1:03:37] down and he was baptized and you know no
[1:03:40] doubt no doubt she knew all about these
[1:03:42] things had been witness to many things
[1:03:43] to see him being anointed for his
[1:03:47] ministry and coming in and doing the
[1:03:49] miracles here's the same one that she
[1:03:53] didn't know no doubt she probably stayed
[1:03:55] up with him at night when he was sick in
[1:03:57] different things and yet here's this one
[1:03:59] doing these miracles preaching the word
[1:04:02] and how about this how about this mother
[1:04:06] carrying this child raised him up and
[1:04:08] all this and in the dirt all this time
[1:04:10] he's standing there and saying tear down
[1:04:12] this temple in three days I'll raise it
[1:04:14] again how would you how would you feel
[1:04:18] if your child kept telling you this in
[1:04:20] mind
[1:04:21] but I came into this world to be the
[1:04:23] Lamb of God what about if it was
[1:04:24] prophesied all the things that he said
[1:04:27] that was going to take place this is my
[1:04:29] this is my outcome this is what I come
[1:04:31] to do she'd seen all those things take
[1:04:35] place
[1:04:36] send all the miracles all the things
[1:04:38] that took place and then and then one
[1:04:42] day when the when Judas betrayed him and
[1:04:47] he was taken taken by the rulers and
[1:04:51] everybody had betrayed him and left him
[1:04:56] you know it breaks a mother's heart to
[1:04:58] see that how would you you know when you
[1:05:03] see your child and he's taken and then
[1:05:05] he's beaten and he's had his beard
[1:05:06] pulled out and they spit on him can you
[1:05:13] imagine what she was going through what
[1:05:17] was breaking this woman's heart when he
[1:05:20] was when he was whipped and beaten
[1:05:21] mercilessly and drugged through a street
[1:05:24] carrying a cross and then they took him
[1:05:26] an accepting naked when it was a worse
[1:05:29] worse crucifix in the worst death that
[1:05:31] anybody could suffer and it was her son
[1:05:36] she had went through all of that and
[1:05:40] seen him go through all of that and died
[1:05:43] on a cross and she had and she had
[1:05:47] carried that word she held it and yet
[1:05:52] yet he laid in the he laid in the grave
[1:05:54] when they laid him in and Joseph stoom
[1:05:56] and he was there and had been one day in
[1:06:00] two days and three days and you know
[1:06:05] what she couldn't wait to get to the
[1:06:07] tomb the scripture says you know they
[1:06:10] rose early in the morning why because
[1:06:12] she had to prepare her son's dead body
[1:06:14] for burial and she went running to the
[1:06:19] tomb and you know what what she went
[1:06:22] running to the tomb and then she would
[1:06:24] she was there and you know what there's
[1:06:25] no body he's gone there's nothing there
[1:06:28] and you know what she's heartbroken
[1:06:30] she's she's all to pieces and she sees a
[1:06:33] man he
[1:06:34] like where did you do with my Lord's
[1:06:35] body and you know what he was there
[1:06:40] talking to her and she didn't recognize
[1:06:41] he was him she wanted to know where his
[1:06:46] body was and there he wasn't he said
[1:06:47] Mary in her lower the lowest point
[1:06:52] brother and said her lowest point when I
[1:06:54] whacked her she went through all of that
[1:06:55] and there she was standing and he was in
[1:06:57] her man speaking to her and many times
[1:07:03] we get in the same condition the lowest
[1:07:05] of the lowest the problems that we faced
[1:07:07] all the different cuz situations that we
[1:07:08] go through and we wonder where God is
[1:07:10] and you know what he's in the midst and
[1:07:12] he's speaking our name he's speaking to
[1:07:16] you he calls in he's calling your name
[1:07:18] and he was just like he was he was
[1:07:20] speaking to Mary and then she realized
[1:07:23] who it was he said don't touch me
[1:07:27] he said I've got to ascend but you know
[1:07:30] he said go tell my disciples you know he
[1:07:35] come to her you know when when that
[1:07:40] angel come to this young girl and gave
[1:07:43] her that word you know years down the
[1:07:45] road because she imagined being the
[1:07:47] woman that had been that young teenager
[1:07:49] to hear that word and then years later
[1:07:50] standing there and seeing the things
[1:07:53] that he went through could she you know
[1:07:56] there's no I don't think she does await
[1:07:57] that she could have imagined the pain
[1:07:59] and the agony that he went through to
[1:08:01] see to be a mother to go through that
[1:08:05] but you know what it all came together
[1:08:07] when he came from the grave why because
[1:08:09] he had promised he had prophesied that
[1:08:11] he would be raised from the dead and
[1:08:16] many times we just look at the bad
[1:08:18] things and we get our eyes on the wrong
[1:08:19] thing but you know what there's a
[1:08:20] promise in the word for us why because
[1:08:23] he's risen from the dead he's alive and
[1:08:25] he's alive forevermore whatever you have
[1:08:28] neither than the scripture it's alive
[1:08:30] and same one that scripture laid in the
[1:08:35] you know the word was there for her and
[1:08:37] it was laying in the in the scripture
[1:08:40] but you know she held on to what was
[1:08:43] taught to her and you know what he
[1:08:47] carried her all the way to the upper
[1:08:48] room all the things that she had went
[1:08:53] through but you know what there was an
[1:08:55] upper room experience for and brothers
[1:08:59] and sisters we have that same
[1:09:00] opportunity no matter how bad it gets no
