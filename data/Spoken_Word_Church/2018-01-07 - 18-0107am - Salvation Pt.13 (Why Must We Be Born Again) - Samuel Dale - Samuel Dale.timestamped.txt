[8:56] helpless as it says in the scripture -
[8:59] pull up tight together and to walk in
[9:01] your grace in order to see because we
[9:04] know that someone has already made this
[9:06] journey for us because it was you Lord
[9:09] that made it in human flesh upon the
[9:12] earth to walk to the place to work you

[9:21] you forgive our sins cleanse us from all
[9:23] unrighteousness and bless us together in
[9:26] you in Jesus name Amen okay Jonah -
[9:34] because remember we're still on
[9:36] salvation but I will sacrifice unto thee
[9:40] with the voice of Thanksgiving I will
[9:42] pay that that I have vowed salvation is
[9:47] of the Lord all right now that delivers
[9:49] is what and the Lord spoken to the fish
[9:51] and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry
[9:55] and all right let's go to first
[9:57] Corinthians a very odd scripture but I'm
[10:00] pray that it will open up to word that
[10:04] we can see you know and right on down to
[10:07] where we're at okay so we're going to
[10:09] first Corinthians 15:44 now we're not
[10:13] going to get in to up in above it you
[10:16] know it's cholesterol and cholesterol
[10:17] and etc coming down we just start about
[10:21] verse 45 44 it is sown a natural body in
[10:25] his raised a spiritual body there is a
[10:27] natural body and there is a spiritual
[10:29] body and so it is written the first man
[10:33] Adam was what was made a living soul and
[10:38] the life Adam was made a quickening
[10:42] spirit now how be it that was not first
[10:45] which is spiritual it doesn't mean that
[10:49] Adam come before God or whatever it's
[10:51] just meaning you start with a natural
[10:55] that Adam was a living soul you start
[10:59] from that and then you go forwards
[11:02] alright so then what does he say how be
[11:05] it that was not first which is spiritual
[11:07] with that which is natural and afterward
[11:10] that which is spiritual the first man is
[11:13] of the earth earthy the second man is
[11:16] the Lord from heaven as is their earthy
[11:20] such are they also that are earthy we
[11:24] took on the natural thing just like Adam
[11:26] and time and as is the heavenly such are
[11:29] they also that are heavenly as we have
[11:33] borne the image of the earthy we shall
[11:36] also bear the image of the heavenly now
[11:39] this I say brethren that flesh and blood
[11:41] cannot inherit the kingdom of God
[11:44] neither does corruption inherit
[11:45] incorruption you may be seated
[11:47] Lord that is blessing through the
[11:50] reading of the word now then we
[11:57] we know as I said the scripture said it
[11:59] wasn't and words which Adam came first
[12:02] the natural Adam that was made a living
[12:04] soul all right
[12:07] that was it then the second adam is the
[12:11] lord of glory okay all right so we'll
[12:14] get back to that in a minute in our talk
[12:17] and what we're trying to bring okay now
[12:21] we studied throughout the Old Testament
[12:24] of the plan of redemption for those
[12:27] people and we put this in every service
[12:30] because we don't want people to think
[12:33] that well we don't believe in this that
[12:35] or the other we believe in a plan of
[12:37] redemption in the Old Testament that was
[12:40] under the blood of bulls and goats all
[12:43] right
[12:43] and it was dire by faith in believing
[12:46] that it wasn't this you just went up
[12:49] flopped down a lamb no it was that you
[12:52] believe that lamb was taking your place
[12:55] so it's believing what was the salvation
[12:58] in the Old Testament a people believing
[13:01] in God it wasn't a matter of
[13:04] justification sanctification the baptism
[13:07] of the Holy Ghost and things like that
[13:08] that was not in the Old Testament it was
[13:11] the salvation and most of your linking
[13:15] to salvation was really natural al and
[13:19] the people were promised to Abraham in a
[13:21] land and it was promised him a seed
[13:24] alright because it was nothing back
[13:26] there in the form of salvation to bring
[13:30] you to eternal life or anything like
[13:32] that
[13:33] under that because Jesus Christ had not
[13:35] died yet
[13:36] alright see then knowing that we can see
[13:40] that salvation was based upon now this
[13:46] was the last message I didn't complete
[13:48] it but we will take it up the Lord will
[13:50] in the next service of more into
[13:53] believing and what it really means to be
[13:56] believing with those people back their
[13:59] salvation was not far everybody it was
[14:03] made for those that would believe all
[14:06] right now it's not that they couldn't
[14:08] receive it or whatever they do you know
[14:10] it was iron but it was believing not
[14:15] just to say believe that there was a God
[14:19] you know that was great but to believe
[14:22] for them was to believe that God was
[14:25] dealing with them personally all right
[14:29] now remember the thing that we've
[14:31] emphasized over and over whatever that
[14:34] you see in the Old Testament of
[14:35] salvation must be brought to the New
[14:38] Testament and not change that as being a
[14:43] dog and a cat over here and a horse over
[14:45] here or something but it's to have a
[14:48] greater value or what was revealed here
[14:52] our meaning salvation in the Old
[14:54] Testament then you come into the New
[14:56] Testament opens up into a a greater
[14:58] understanding of what God is trying to
[15:02] do all right now see then doing that
[15:05] then what was salvation based upon back
[15:08] there as I said it wasn't I've never
[15:10] believed it that you just go up and take
[15:12] a lamb won't flop it down and say
[15:15] there's a lamb I've done my deed no it
[15:19] was faith in God to believe that lamb
[15:23] was taking your place right and that
[15:29] whatever was wrong that lamb would take
[15:33] your place and and you know when God
[15:36] would be satisfied with what was being
[15:39] done so it was your faith in the fact
[15:41] that you believed in God and not just
[15:44] believe in a God or some God you know
[15:49] that wasn't what it was it was a belief
[15:53] in God Himself coming to you God spoke
[15:57] to Abraham and told him get up and go
[15:59] and he got him win they he was above all
[16:03] the other gods you know that tell him to
[16:05] do this or whatever he's this one began
[16:08] to talk to him about his life and what
[16:10] was going on all right now so then it's
[16:13] base-2 privation whether it be old our
[16:16] new testament it's based upon your
[16:19] believing your believing
[16:22] in God not in a God but in God of the
[16:29] word because we was reading the
[16:30] scripture writer they he that cometh to
[16:32] God and Hebrew must believe that he is
[16:35] right now is not not was that's fine our
[16:39] will be is fine
[16:40] but for right now so your salvation and
[16:43] not based upon a God of back Darth it's
[16:48] based upon God in you and I believe in
[16:52] right now all right
[16:54] bringing us to that place okay now we
[16:58] went through these scriptures you know
[17:00] to to cover it but just to review a
[17:04] second so we know that it says in
[17:08] Genesis now I love these because these
[17:11] to me
[17:12] I've always believed and tried to teach
[17:15] because I saw this in the Baptist Church
[17:18] of the scriptures that was there that we
[17:22] were the children of Abraham by faith
[17:25] there's not a natural Jew I wasn't
[17:28] trying to be a natural jus thought I
[17:30] knew the scripture is not a Jews would
[17:31] you out when Judas inwardly see meaning
[17:34] something had to happen all right but
[17:36] I've always believed that the Bible
[17:38] teaching that Abraham was the father of
[17:41] faith and it was so much related to
[17:45] Abraham until it would make him to her
[17:49] that the preparation for a place to go
[17:51] to would be called the bosom of Abraham
[17:55] now that's how much God thought about
[17:58] him and what he was doing but the
[18:01] scripture says in Genesis 16 and in 15
[18:05] and 6 and he believed in the Lord and he
[18:08] counted it to him for righteousness in
[18:14] other words he believed in God and that
[18:17] brought his salvation are you in me
[18:22] abraham believed in God and that brought
[18:26] his salvation brought his deliverance
[18:29] brought his you know bringing him to a
[18:33] place they're calling him righteous
[18:35] what is the what is the point of
[18:37] righteousness the state of fact of being
[18:39] right aren't abraham believed God and
[18:43] God says that's right that's right you
[18:50] got it right and I'll make you just as
[18:52] righteous as I am because it would go
[18:56] from right to righteousness and going
[18:59] into the point all right then we come
[19:00] over to Roman's four and three for what
[19:03] says the scripture abraham believed god
[19:04] and it was counted unto him for
[19:06] righteousness
[19:09] holmen's for 21 and 22 and being fully
[19:13] persuaded that he had what he had
[19:15] promised he was able to perform and
[19:17] therefore it was imputed to him for
[19:20] righteousness
[19:20] he believed God and it was imputed unto
[19:24] inferences Galatians three and six even
[19:28] as abraham believed God and it was
[19:30] accounted to him for righteousness
[19:33] a lot of being said about this point of
[19:36] Abraham believing right James two and
[19:38] twenty three and the scripture was
[19:40] fulfilled which saith abraham believed
[19:43] God and it was imputed unto him for
[19:45] righteousness and he was called the
[19:46] friend of God now in knowing that then
[19:51] we see that a lot is related or it's all
[19:55] related to believe in he didn't say
[20:00] Abraham was just righteous and I chose
[20:02] him no it says abraham believed god now
[20:10] what if abraham hadn't believed god he
[20:12] wouldn't have said that is that sensible
[20:14] is that reasonable you know if he had to
[20:18] believe God God wouldn't would not have
[20:22] accepted him so then we can go back to
[20:26] predestination
[20:27] why does God do this why does God do
[20:30] that why does some come in and water
[20:33] some not come in we went through those
[20:35] things trying to define it to understand
[20:38] to see that God chose Abraham and what
[20:41] did the prophets say he said about he
[20:43] said I know Abraham will teach his
[20:47] children so then it goes automatically
[20:50] down to the genealogies of Abraham and
[20:53] his descendants coming down - Isaac -
[20:58] coming towards Christ all right now then
[21:01] knowing that we covered this and it's on
[21:05] the message are our sin Romans 4:16 that
[21:11] Abraham who is the father of us all now
[21:18] Abraham being the father of us all
[21:21] that's all of the seed of Abraham that's
[21:24] not all mankind he's not the father of
[21:26] all mankind and it's not in connected to
[21:30] all of his children remember we went
[21:32] through that Abraham had a bunch of boys
[21:36] but none of them was chosen for that
[21:39] lineage - Pais down spiritually speaking
[21:42] to go from one to the other
[21:44] except Isaac and Isaac would be a type
[21:48] of Christ all right and Abraham then
[21:51] would be the father of us all now I like
[21:56] that because it says in Genesis talking
[21:59] about says it Eve is the mother of all
[22:01] living
[22:01] we're quick to quote that that
[22:05] everything comes through the wound of
[22:07] Eve because she's a mother of all living
[22:10] but it doesn't say Adam is the father of
[22:13] all living because that would have made
[22:14] two genealogies and messed up but it
[22:18] says in this situation here coming to
[22:21] the New Testament form - look at it it
[22:24] said Abraham is the father of us all not
[22:29] all the world not all the people what is
[22:32] he the father of the faith seed not a
[22:38] natural seed not natural genealogies
[22:41] he's the father of the faith seed right
[22:45] he's the father other children of God no
[22:48] no Jesus is my father see you're not
[22:51] listening you're not paying attention to
[22:55] what was being done all right now listen
[22:59] so then the first man Adam first
[23:04] christen we just read was made a living
[23:08] soul all right now the second Adam was
[23:16] made a quickening spirit the god of
[23:20] glory
[23:21] so the first man Adam now was a living
[23:24] soul the first one that come into being
[23:28] in the Bible terminologies of talking
[23:31] about a living soul was Adam right Adam
[23:35] came into the world or living so God
[23:38] breathed into his nostrils and he became
[23:40] a living soul now what I love about that
[23:44] is what I've tried to keep you to you
[23:46] know get you to always remember that
[23:49] according to the prophet in blasphemous
[23:51] names that God breathed especially into
[23:57] Adam eternal life and made him an
[24:01] eternal person he says with God huh what
[24:06] do we believe that no no no he would
[24:07] just maybe eat no because he was the
[24:10] first of that generation or that
[24:13] genealogy are that coming forth of
[24:16] mankind was Adam why would he not start
[24:21] with eternal life in his soul we get his
[24:27] body his spirit would have been not
[24:30] eternal all right why would that not be
[24:35] a beautiful situation to bring it down
[24:38] then from Adam and being the first Adam
[24:44] and then Jesus being the second Adam or
[24:48] the Lord of glory and how that he would
[24:52] start his life you remember that the
[24:55] other day we're trying to emphasize it
[24:57] sees in the Lord Jesus when he came he
[25:02] was body of flesh not eternal soul and
[25:07] spirit being Almighty God eternal he's
[25:10] our second Adam
[25:12] huh see the first atom eternal life in
[25:16] his soul the first beginning of mankind
[25:21] was the way God wanted it right is that
[25:26] that a sensible thought the way he
[25:29] wanted mankind he made Adam that mankind
[25:33] all right
[25:35] because he knew that story and he knew
[25:37] how it was going to come all right but
[25:39] that was the way he made him and like
[25:41] I've always tried to get you I've always
[25:43] preached it this away for 50 years
[25:45] nearly that Adam was God's example and
[25:51] he gave him eternal life in his soul but
[25:55] his body was not eternal yet if he'd
[25:58] have stayed in that position without sin
[26:01] the Prophet said his youth was being
[26:04] renewed daily everything was running
[26:10] great there was no time there was no CN
[26:14] there was no nothing it was a beautiful
[26:18] situation and what if he'd have stayed
[26:21] that way and seeing it not entered the
[26:23] picture then would not we have come as
[26:28] the children of God through Adam and Eve
[26:32] bringing the Word of God speaking it and
[26:35] it bring it into manifestation and then
[26:38] we could have all went to the tree of
[26:40] life because the Bible speaks of it
[26:42] being there all right then we could have
[26:45] all been made eternal well what's the
[26:49] difference it's not that what God is
[26:52] still it does that strike you is not
[26:57] that what God is doing he comes in his
[27:00] you eternal life in your soul making you
[27:05] a child of God he starts working out
[27:08] through the spirit back out into the
[27:12] flesh to try to bring us back to where
[27:14] Adam was right
[27:19] and there comes the Lord Jesus to show
[27:24] that it could be done because he was the
[27:26] beginning of the creation of God
[27:27] revelation 3:14 alright that was not God
[27:33] dis rework in a human race Jesus was not
[27:37] God this coming from man he didn't come
[27:40] from man he come by creation like the
[27:44] first Adam Cain the first Adam came by
[27:47] creation into life the second Adam came
[27:50] by creation not by sexual intercourse or
[27:53] anything they just barred the world or
[27:56] that it would come forth and be kinfolks
[27:58] to you and I but then was set forth in
[28:02] Jesus Christ what he wants mankind to be
[28:07] now and he's not that - way as I said
[28:10] there it is being done he gives us a new
[28:13] birth
[28:14] that puts eternal life in our soul and
[28:18] he's working on us to bring us to a
[28:21] change of the body and see then that
[28:25] when that takes place you'll have it
[28:28] back the way Adam was because now listen
[28:33] you go into adoption we'll get into that
[28:36] in a different thing Adam was ruler of
[28:39] the earth
[28:41] Adam was brethren said God of the earth
[28:45] right he said that's what he wants his
[28:48] children to be within it was an example
[28:53] but by the fall coming into being
[28:56] it took us into a position that we
[28:58] couldn't do it so he had to come himself
[29:03] to pay the price to set it up and he
[29:07] would be called the beginning of the
[29:10] creation of God that would be God in
[29:15] human flesh showing what he desired to
[29:20] be in the beginning but Adam lost that
[29:25] part the one Adam lost there what did
[29:28] the prophets say Jesus Christ restored
[29:33] so he's gonna restore sonship I was
[29:39] looking at one this morning there were
[29:40] utterance that he said that's what
[29:42] happened to Adam he said he lost his God
[29:44] shield I like that he said he lost his
[29:47] God because he was the god of the
[29:50] earth
[29:51] what about being able to name all the
[29:53] animals and do all of those things we'll
[29:57] see that was what God wanted that's what
[29:59] God wants now on what's going to be
[30:02] brother Dale to bring us to a change of
[30:04] the body somebody he's gonna have to
[30:08] come back where Adam was the god of the
[30:12] earth now then but one way to do that
[30:15] and that's through Jesus Christ there's
[30:19] not a way of us working ourselves back
[30:21] to some form of a utopia of life or
[30:24] whatever it would be to bring no it's
[30:29] one simple time you must be born again
[30:34] and we're starting the New Testament of
[30:37] the thought now you must be born again
[30:40] what I want to ask the question because
[30:43] I want it in a question or form to you
[30:45] why must we be born again now come on
[30:55] we Baptists we taught that you must be
[31:03] born again now when I get to it I want
[31:05] to read some things but around that said
[31:07] about the new birth and what but I was
[31:09] looking at one and it's letting on my
[31:12] desk now and I would ask you to read
[31:18] okay you always want me to tell you
[31:20] something to do and whatever or listen
[31:23] to the tape there's a tape called key to
[31:26] the door starts it okay
[31:29] key to the door it's just one statement
[31:32] part comes out are pretty good paragraph
[31:34] but if you'll read that you'll hear it
[31:37] then next go to a statue of a perfect
[31:42] man
[31:43] in the next go to blasphemous names
[31:46] there's one more in between I'll get it
[31:48] later
[31:49] but you've got enough diary you got
[31:50] three messages especially listened to
[31:53] stature of a perfect man and then listen
[31:56] to blasphemous names because we want to
[31:59] get into that later into what we're
[32:02] talking about because you're getting
[32:05] into restoration and understanding it
[32:08] all right then you'll begin to see why
[32:10] brother Branham would make statements
[32:12] that he made and he'd say I can't
[32:22] elusively prove by this picture that
[32:28] you're born again but you're believing
[32:31] on Jesus Christ and then you're baptized
[32:35] into the body by the baptism with a hole
[32:37] to go but now the statement that I want
[32:41] you to think about that he said he said
[32:44] there's eleven hundred and something
[32:46] different denominations or something to
[32:48] this degree now paraphrasing it a little
[32:50] bit and he says there's 11 107 something
[32:56] different ways that man teaches of the
[32:59] new birth now that's his word he says
[33:05] they they've teach each church teaches
[33:08] its own way of being born again he said
[33:15] they have some good things and he said I
[33:19] don't argue with him about their points
[33:21] but he said they've got eleven hundred
[33:24] and seven different ways of being born
[33:28] again well may I had about two thousand
[33:33] in this message of the way the message
[33:35] people teach the new birth are the
[33:38] born-again experience or whatever we're
[33:44] going to make it so simple until when we
[33:46] begin to think about it we're going to
[33:47] start like this we're gonna say the day
[33:51] you believe
[33:52] you start your salvation the day you
[33:56] believe then it'll have to go on from
[34:05] there okay all right now watch what
[34:08] we're getting at so then the first man
[34:11] Adam was made a living soul
[34:15] okay the second Adam was made a
[34:19] quickening spirit see now we're so quick
[34:21] to to be so revel a 'td until we'll jump
[34:26] onto something and when it says now the
[34:28] first was not spiritual the first was
[34:32] natural he's talking about a living soul
[34:35] Adam was naturally made a living soul
[34:41] all right Lucy was a but but he was a
[34:45] spirit first he well he was a son of God
[34:47] he would see we've got it so great until
[34:50] we don't listen to the simplicity of
[34:54] things to follow it we've got to see
[35:00] like you say like saying there now the
[35:03] Bible says it was not the first that was
[35:06] spiritual but was natural but further
[35:10] Dale the Prophet told that Adam you know
[35:20] he would have been spiritually inside of
[35:25] him and he was the son of God see
[35:30] instead of listening to the point that
[35:32] the Scriptures saying it doesn't matter
[35:36] what Adam was before he was he came to
[35:40] be in physical form a son of God so the
[35:47] first man Adam was a living soul
[35:51] whatever you want to think of what he
[35:53] was back here whatever just remember
[35:55] that was put in to a human element
[36:00] called Adam
[36:02] and he would have been the first Adam
[36:05] because he would have been the first to
[36:07] the human race then Jesus Christ would
[36:11] be the first of this new race that is
[36:14] not the old race done over among quoting
[36:18] from the church age book and the thought
[36:19] it's not Jesus Christ wasn't just some
[36:22] old race done over that's why the new
[36:25] birth is not just an old race of people
[36:26] done over it's a complete new race Jesus
[36:32] started a total new race all right and
[36:36] then he the first message he preached of
[36:42] all of the things that would be for him
[36:45] to be able to talk to Nicodemus about he
[36:52] really throws it out in a lump shell to
[36:55] him
[36:55] the Nicodemus just said sir and Jesus
[37:00] says you must be born again when
[37:07] Nicodemus the greatest of all the
[37:08] religious leaders called even Jesus
[37:10] recognized in debate of that caliber and
[37:14] he said don't you understand these
[37:15] things he said
[37:23] he that's born dove I'll get to it he
[37:27] that's born of water and of spirit he
[37:36] said that's what you need Nicodemus
[37:39] Nicodemus says you mean I got to go back
[37:41] to my mother's wound well he certainly
[37:45] didn't understand the statement that the
[37:49] Lord Jesus was making right the Yeti was
[37:53] the most capable of any of the children
[37:57] of Israel because he was in that
[37:59] position and knowing everything in all
[38:03] and he was brother Branham says and the
[38:06] Bible would verify then he called action
[38:08] the Adiemus in him he was calling him D
[38:11] teacher then Nicodemus verse highs back
[38:13] to him which you're the teacher but are
[38:19] you listening first man Adam a living
[38:23] soul whatever you want to make him
[38:26] before then and he was this and he was
[38:27] that a new that's fine that's wonderful
[38:29] but just remember he had a beginning
[38:31] upon earth and his beginning upon earth
[38:36] was a human element with eternal life
[38:39] into his soul because that would be the
[38:44] plan the purpose of God and what he
[38:46] wanted around Jesus would come the same
[38:50] way to be the god of glory but step into
[38:54] human flesh right shoulders spirit would
[39:00] be eternal but step into human flesh to
[39:03] be the beginning of the creation of God
[39:06] all right
[39:07] when God would come into creation right
[39:11] is that beginning of the creation of God
[39:13] God would have come into creation all
[39:15] right see then in doing that then he was
[39:19] the example the first Adam was the
[39:22] example the second Adam is the example
[39:25] he all right then truly we can see that
[39:30] what Adam lost the second Adam come to
[39:35] restore
[39:37] alright now let's deal with a point that
[39:43] thinking about it and I just want to
[39:45] read that Scripture so go ahead pull up
[39:46] number five and we'll read John 3 but
[39:51] now I don't want to divide I don't want
[39:53] to go verse by verse I want to just read
[39:55] it and then we'll go through something
[39:58] and cover it and it will back up and go
[40:01] verse by verse all right so it won't be
[40:04] you know it's not just well I'll do it
[40:06] and listen to what it says all right now
[40:09] what did Jesus say now remember Letran
[40:12] said this is his first sermon now like
[40:15] we were talking so much was about it
[40:17] that his first miracle was to turn the
[40:22] water to wine but had he not done
[40:26] miracles before probably done plenty of
[40:33] miracles before but it starts out for
[40:36] what you're wanting what you're trying
[40:40] to place it
[40:41] what you're trying to get a beginning
[40:44] and his first was to turn water to wine
[40:49] now watch that in a minute when we
[40:51] related on over to the other part of the
[40:53] scripture okay that was for a purpose it
[40:58] wasn't just that he you know remember
[41:01] his mother's he was talking life's not
[41:04] about it that other words he said I
[41:08] haven't entered my ministry yet well she
[41:15] evidently had confidence in the fact
[41:17] that he could handle the situation so
[41:21] she just turns around to them and says
[41:23] whatever he says do you do it huh but
[41:28] now why does he walk out the doors yet
[41:30] to no one walked out he would have been
[41:32] doing what he was supposed to does it
[41:34] right are you following me if he just
[41:38] walked out and not done nothing she
[41:41] wouldn't still been she would have still
[41:42] know that he was who he was and whatever
[41:47] she didn't force him into a situation to
[41:51] her that he had to do something to
[41:53] explain her he could walk out of the
[41:55] building that's what we're talking about
[41:57] life not he could've just walked out but
[42:01] see she had enough confidence to know
[42:03] that he could handle a situation but he
[42:07] said I haven't entered in my ministry
[42:08] well that wasn't his ministry turning
[42:10] water to wine come on this ministry to
[42:16] turn water to wine you can call it the
[42:19] first miracle but his ministry was there
[42:21] on the River Jordan when he said this is
[42:24] my beloved son attend one pleased to
[42:26] dwell that was his ministry right so
[42:31] then get it right in your understanding
[42:33] and then you won't run off with this
[42:35] great oh this great revelation that
[42:38] doesn't follow all the way through but
[42:40] he did have to turn water into wine I
[42:43] mean her brother did years ago he asked
[42:45] the question said would you turn water
[42:47] into wine I wouldn't want to to pass out
[42:51] a bunch of other people get drunk
[42:53] because I think that's passed and gone
[42:56] but I sure hope that the words that I'm
[42:58] trying to bring this day these two
[43:00] trying to turn water we're getting a
[43:03] minute what is water I'm trying to turn
[43:10] water into wine right I'm trying to
[43:14] preach to you by revelation that will
[43:17] bring you to a spiritual understanding
[43:20] not try to make wine alright now listen
[43:23] there was a man of the Pharisees named
[43:26] Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same
[43:28] came to Jesus by night and said unto
[43:30] master rabbi we know that thou art a
[43:32] teacher come from God for no man can do
[43:34] these miracles that thou doest except
[43:36] God be with him jesus answered and said
[43:38] unto Him early early I say unto thee
[43:42] Nicodemus is bragging on him putting him
[43:44] up in a position making him the teacher
[43:46] doing all this uh and Jesus looks at him
[43:48] and says early verily I say unto you
[43:51] except a man be born again he cannot see
[43:54] the kingdom of God
[43:59] he just looks like he burns him totally
[44:03] out and throws him away but then watch
[44:06] Nicodemus said to him how can a man be
[44:08] born when he's old can he enter the
[44:10] second time into his mother's womb to be
[44:11] born
[44:12] jesus answered verily verily I say unto
[44:14] thee except a man be born to water
[44:18] another spirit he cannot enter into the
[44:21] kingdom of God that which is born to the
[44:23] flesh is flesh and that which is born to
[44:25] the spirit is fear Marvel not did I say
[44:28] unto thee you must be born again all
[44:30] right now he asked him in other words
[44:36] he's died really to Nicodemus is to
[44:40] learn from the Lord Jesus right so he
[44:45] came to him to really ask him questions
[44:49] you remember the man there that come to
[44:51] him said what must we do to be born
[44:53] again well see it's not written that
[44:55] Nicodemus asked him what to do to be
[44:57] born again or whatever that is that
[44:59] would have been to the other
[45:00] illustration but evidently there was a
[45:02] discussion sitting down
[45:04] they didn't just walk you didn't walk in
[45:06] and said Nicodemus you must be born
[45:07] again
[45:08] they probably set to iron discuss things
[45:11] and Nicodemus said well I know you're a
[45:14] man sent from God cousin we can do these
[45:17] things except God be with you and then
[45:20] Jesus says okay now let's see if he
[45:23] means it Nicodemus had made a great
[45:28] statement right declaring him to be the
[45:32] D teacher a man sent from God and Jesus
[45:40] said well let's see if you believe it
[45:46] odd statement said let's see if you
[45:50] believe it
[45:51] he's a Nicodemus you must be born again
[45:59] Nicodemus and you know there was no
[46:03] teaching from the Old Testament in their
[46:06] terminologies that had been brought down
[46:08] upon that situation even the greatest of
[46:12] all the teachings that could come forth
[46:14] of Messiah to come of God to come in
[46:17] human flesh
[46:18] all of the things that they had been
[46:21] taught Nicodemus could have quoted every
[46:23] one of them he could have looked back
[46:29] into Lord Jesus when he said that but
[46:31] he's just so dumbfounded he could look
[46:33] back and he said do you believe you're
[46:34] the Messiah he could have said do you
[46:38] believe you're this do you believe
[46:39] you're that but he didn't do it the Lord
[46:42] Jesus we're really saying let's see if
[46:44] you understand who what you're doing he
[46:49] said you must be born again in Nicodemus
[46:56] that this goes all beyond him because he
[46:58] has no understanding of all of his great
[47:02] mental believing they remember the
[47:06] service the other day were talking about
[47:08] to believe in and there's a book finally
[47:09] got up to the point and Jesus looked at
[47:12] him after they finally said we believe
[47:14] you're this we believe you're that and
[47:16] he lives he said do you now believe
[47:22] Nicodemus was a great believer he
[47:25] believed he was son of God and miracles
[47:27] happening he believed he was a great
[47:29] teacher he believed a lot of things
[47:31] about the Lord Jesus but when the Lord
[47:35] Jesus looked at him and said you must be
[47:37] born again he knew nothing about that
[47:43] there was no teaching about that new
[47:46] birth planted ours we call some
[47:50] scripture that would say back there you
[47:52] must be born again you know some you
[47:55] understand what I'm saying there was no
[47:57] scriptures writing about the new
[47:59] it was tight our shadows and showing it
[48:04] but Nicodemus couldn't handle types and
[48:06] shadows right that's why I love brother
[48:11] branham the way the ears go he would
[48:13] take something and he'd take a type you
[48:16] say now I know you can't understand how
[48:18] that there's just one God but he said
[48:22] let me explain it he said you're a
[48:25] father you're human and you a son see
[48:31] he's taken the tops and the shadows to
[48:34] express the reality but there were no
[48:37] types and shadows for Nicodemus to use
[48:40] until he said you mean I gotta go back
[48:42] to my mother's wound and be born the
[48:43] second time from her in other words he
[48:47] probably was saying listen I've heard
[48:49] some of your teaching some of the things
[48:51] you said around caught it's been rumored
[48:53] you said when are you were not doing too
[48:55] much bother but surely some of them knew
[48:57] something about him cause it had a note
[48:59] something about him how when Nicodemus
[49:00] wanted to come to it you follow me I
[49:03] mean surely somebody they knew all about
[49:06] him and they do it and Nicodemus could
[49:08] probably say listen I've heard some of
[49:10] your teachings I've heard you teaching
[49:13] that we were born wrong he said I've
[49:19] heard some of your teaching and he said
[49:21] we're not gonna argue Nations but I like
[49:25] it like that
[49:26] Oh when brother Bissell and him was
[49:28] talking to that rabbi and that was
[49:31] explaining to him you know what happened
[49:33] in the garden and the rabbi he says to
[49:39] know something paraphrasing it now he
[49:42] said to know that maybe the the problem
[49:44] in the garden was the sex act he said
[49:48] we'd have no problems with that we
[49:50] studied this
[49:52] he said what you bring up a new thing
[49:55] when you say it was between Eve and the
[49:58] Beast see it was something they never
[50:01] thought of but they had taught maybe the
[50:05] act and the problems so Nicodemus is
[50:09] talking to the Lord Jesus and he's
[50:10] saying I know this and I know that and I
[50:14] know some of your teaching but said then
[50:19] after your teachings of me being born
[50:21] wrong are you saying that I've got to go
[50:23] back and be born
[50:25] another time from the mother he said
[50:28] because listen he'd say I'm sensible if
[50:32] I was going wrong the first time the
[50:35] second time would make me no different
[50:37] Rock was not that a sensible answer back
[50:41] to him you know what good would it do
[50:44] for me to have another birth and Jesus
[50:48] said you don't understand now he gets
[50:52] down to a language that we'll get to it
[50:55] in a second he says you must be born
[51:01] from above because that's the original
[51:08] but yet he's bringing it because the
[51:12] poornam deities that see Nicodemus I
[51:15] want to stay on that point before we go
[51:16] to that Nicodemus new things was being
[51:20] said so we just read we read a
[51:24] two-minute account you know two minutes
[51:28] that all it would have talked for the
[51:29] Lord Jesus and Nicodemus has said what
[51:31] you say it we don't put it in there as
[51:35] hours of discussions and and talking we
[51:41] just put all that's just five minutes
[51:42] all he said was in then if it anyways
[51:46] gets up walks out no
[51:52] see expressing it into the language that
[51:55] you'd be Nicodemus would say I know
[52:04] listen
[52:08] if you're following the story then
[52:09] listen to what I'm talking about
[52:11] Nicodemus would say to him say look I
[52:16] know we were born wrong
[52:24] and say I know we were born wrong and
[52:30] said I know Psalm 51 and five that I was
[52:35] shapen in iniquity and in sin did my
[52:38] mother conceive me you could say and
[52:45] I've in Psalm 58 and three the wicked
[52:49] are estranged from the wound and their
[52:51] go astray as soon as they're born
[52:53] speaking lies see we always quote it
[53:00] like bread a rental quote we were born
[53:01] in sin shapen in iniquity spout from our
[53:03] mothers wound and a liar we put it all
[53:05] together as one scripture and then you
[53:06] try to find that scripture and you can't
[53:08] find it because it's not that's not what
[53:10] it says that's two scriptures that says
[53:13] that all right
[53:14] but you see Nicodemus would have to
[53:18] agree to these scriptures right and he
[53:23] would have to agree to the point that
[53:27] job would say in fourteen and one man
[53:30] that's born of a woman is of few days
[53:33] and full of trouble in other words I've
[53:38] heard your your philosophies or stories
[53:43] that people have told that you you
[53:45] taught this that or the other goes like
[53:50] I said now wait a minute Nicodemus you
[53:54] said but but but but that was later in
[53:55] his ministry why are you gonna put
[53:57] another way then why's Nicodemus diary
[53:59] and why's Nicodemus saying we know this
[54:02] and we know that we thought well it's
[54:06] got to be wait until he gets on over
[54:07] here no one Nicodemus could say said
[54:10] I've I've heard a lot of things and said
[54:15] I know the scriptures
[54:16] I know job 15 and 14 they said what is
[54:20] man that they should be clean and he
[54:24] which is born of a woman that he should
[54:27] be righteous
[54:29] you think Nicodemus didn't know them
[54:31] Scriptures you think you didn't know of
[54:33] job 25 and 4 how can man be justified
[54:36] with God ark how can he be clean that is
[54:40] born of a woman you know from the day
[54:51] that I heard the Prophet know it come to
[54:57] me like this those Old Testament Saints
[55:01] those religious leaders they knew about
[55:05] serpent seed maybe not terminologies we
[55:14] use you know of wordings but they knew
[55:20] what happened that was reason that
[55:21] Illustrated want to go where the rabbi
[55:23] said to risk on him said now to her to
[55:25] think about it being sex said that's
[55:28] we've studied those funds we said now to
[55:31] think about it being with even the Beast
[55:33] we haven't studied that that's a new
[55:35] thought the all right and see Nicodemus
[55:41] knew all of these scriptures and he knew
[55:45] that he was born from his mother and he
[55:51] knew that all of that would making him
[55:56] wrong and he knew that but he knew
[56:01] nothing about you must be born again or
[56:03] how to get rid of it now like I said
[56:07] when I first heard this message in in
[56:09] all and I begin to think about I thought
[56:12] my lord in Pharisees why did they say to
[56:16] Jesus we wouldn't born the illegitimate
[56:19] like you right why because they believed
[56:27] his illegitimate see come from the wrong
[56:29] huh but I've also believed this why did
[56:33] those Old Testament signs lie so much on
[56:36] circumcision I would love to talk to a
[56:40] good rabbi and ask him said what's the
[56:43] purpose of circumcision we know
[56:46] physically what it's doing it's cutting
[56:49] off the unclean but what would that mean
[56:52] to Abraham that he had to be circumcised
[56:55] why would it make a different race of
[56:59] people known to and related to Abraham
[57:02] do you understand the children of Israel
[57:06] how the circumcision a lot of people in
[57:09] the world are they're circumcised that's
[57:12] no problem but that was the children of
[57:14] Israel showing the the fact that God had
[57:16] chosen them and gave them the sign of
[57:18] circumcision to show that they were a
[57:24] different nation see if they knew about
[57:30] these things they knew about the
[57:35] circumcisions and the things and what it
[57:37] was all about and see then when Jesus
[57:41] would say anything or at the Nicodemus
[57:44] had heard anything that he taught he
[57:46] knew his relationship was to the fact of
[57:48] being born wrong the inborn wrong though
[57:57] Nicodemus would admit it I don't care
[58:01] how much he believed in his great
[58:03] religious Society but he believed he was
[58:06] born wrong well here's another thing
[58:08] that I've always believed those Jews
[58:11] believed that circumcision done away
[58:15] with a serpent seed doctrine
[58:23] come on they believe the circumcision
[58:26] took a wave to fill to the flesh so we
[58:33] never considered it like that
[58:36] see they believed that those things that
[58:38] God had ordained them to make them a
[58:41] pure people
[58:48] are you following me she's in that away
[58:51] there would be no just a five minute
[58:53] conversation and then Jesus say you must
[58:56] be born again cuz when he hit him the
[59:00] second time right and he said you must
[59:05] be born again Nicodemus nui language and
[59:09] what it meant you must be born let's go
[59:12] into that now let's go back to John
[59:15] brothers and pull out of John 3 and this
[59:18] coldest verse by verse and think about
[59:20] because you can see that is showing the
[59:24] things that have just covered and
[59:27] showing that all of this was taking
[59:29] place and Nicodemus understood a lot of
[59:33] things go ahead and pull up John C there
[59:36] was a man of the first season and
[59:37] Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same
[59:39] came to Jesus by night and said unto Him
[59:41] rabbi master teacher look what he was
[59:48] calling him he wasn't walking in hey I
[59:52] heard you got some trained doctors and
[59:54] thing and you're lost and doomed the
[59:57] only way to help I'm talk to you
[1:00:00] he says rabbi which means teacher we
[1:00:07] know that thou art a teacher come from
[1:00:09] God we who's we him and his close
[1:00:15] relationship right
[1:00:20] those Jews couldn't deny what was taking
[1:00:23] place so they had to make it something
[1:00:26] else and call it bel devote but they
[1:00:29] couldn't do not a fact that it took
[1:00:30] place that's what the Bible said he said
[1:00:32] cause the man was standing there that
[1:00:34] the miracle was done on how could they
[1:00:36] say it wasn't right and then remember
[1:00:40] one of them said he said you you tell me
[1:00:42] this Saturday he said but show me where
[1:00:44] you ever opened the eyes of the blind
[1:00:45] even in your history show me whatever
[1:00:50] the eyes of the blind Mary stood without
[1:00:52] eyes open
[1:00:54] listen we know that thou art a teacher
[1:00:59] come from God look for no man can do
[1:01:02] these miracles that I'll do us except
[1:01:06] God be with him sounds like a pretty
[1:01:10] good believer you want to make a
[1:01:14] believer
[1:01:15] sounds like he's a pretty good believer
[1:01:18] he's in great position right cause he's
[1:01:24] a great believer you look at it if
[1:01:27] they'd have called him dark he would
[1:01:29] have been thrown out oh they're great
[1:01:31] groups
[1:01:33] he's coming secretly to do but he's
[1:01:36] admitting all of the things that the
[1:01:38] Lord Jesus that God must be with you
[1:01:45] look that's why I hit him so hard
[1:01:50] because after he'd made that great
[1:01:53] confession look like Jesus would have
[1:01:56] wrote it yeah you're right I'm this I'm
[1:01:58] that on the other and he wanted to know
[1:02:03] if his believing was true
[1:02:06] you saw I've got a dude bleep bro Dale
[1:02:09] Nicodemus believed that he was a teacher
[1:02:14] Nicodemus called him a rabbi Nicodemus
[1:02:17] Karl said he would come from God and
[1:02:19] that nobody can do the things you've
[1:02:21] done
[1:02:22] except barred to be with him pretty good
[1:02:25] believer all God dude believe what
[1:02:30] Nicodemus born-again
[1:02:35] wasn't mainly he didn't even know what
[1:02:37] it was about but do we look jesus
[1:02:42] answered and said unto Him verily verily
[1:02:45] I say unto thee except a man be born
[1:02:49] again if you don't see or understand the
[1:02:53] kingdom now remember listen that was not
[1:02:57] the wording if you read it in the days
[1:02:59] of Nicodemus right there was what's
[1:03:02] translated into the King James and
[1:03:04] brought down but remember
[1:03:06] Nicodemus knew exactly what he was
[1:03:08] saying he knew what this man was saying
[1:03:16] and he says except a man be born again
[1:03:20] except a man be born from above now he's
[1:03:26] totally got out of the world because
[1:03:27] that's the original translation and
[1:03:29] brother and verifies the original
[1:03:33] translation brings you to accept a man
[1:03:36] be born from above in other words in
[1:03:39] plain language you got to be born from
[1:03:42] where I come from if you're going to
[1:03:44] understand my language in my wording you
[1:03:47] got to get born from where I come from
[1:03:50] and I come from above look at what he's
[1:03:54] putting before him Nicodemus said to him
[1:03:57] how can a man be born when he's old
[1:03:59] that's all he knew how could he enter
[1:04:03] the second time into his mother's womb
[1:04:04] now what jesus answered verily verily I
[1:04:07] say unto you except a man a man be born
[1:04:10] of water and of the spirit he cannot
[1:04:14] enter into the kingdom of God now what
[1:04:17] is to be born to water and spirit
[1:04:20] now you're gonna first automatically run
[1:04:23] to water baptism you've got a point but
[1:04:26] don't hold it to that you're gonna run
[1:04:28] who's got to be born to water baptism
[1:04:30] got to be baptized name of the Lord
[1:04:32] Jesus Christ and that's why you see
[1:04:34] people putting so much emphasis upon
[1:04:35] baptism bringing you in but that's not
[1:04:40] what it's saying
[1:04:42] look except a man be born of water in
[1:04:47] the spirit he cannot enter that which is
[1:04:50] born to the flesh is flesh and that
[1:04:54] which is born to the Spirit is spirit
[1:04:57] Marvel not that I said unto thee he must
[1:05:00] be born from above you got to be born
[1:05:06] from above you got to be born from where
[1:05:07] he was born from right okay now are you
[1:05:12] following me
[1:05:14] so go ahead and down pulling over to
[1:05:16] number six and let's get this point what
[1:05:22] does it mean to be born to water and a
[1:05:25] spirit
[1:05:27] well we can tell you easily the Spirit
[1:05:30] is the Holy Spirit that's fine but see
[1:05:32] we put the emphasis upon the water
[1:05:34] baptism and that's great because you
[1:05:38] follow God in the bad piss you need to
[1:05:42] do that but that's not what it's really
[1:05:44] getting look now remember I believe that
[1:05:46] Jesus Christ says this to ever human
[1:05:49] being you must be born again to every
[1:05:53] human being on his first doctrine except
[1:05:58] a man be born of the water that's the
[1:06:02] word
[1:06:05] why are you baptized to fulfill the word
[1:06:08] it doesn't save you right you only doing
[1:06:11] it as a fulfillment of the word that
[1:06:13] tells you see that's the water washing
[1:06:16] of the water by the word and the spirit
[1:06:24] come on that's the word washing of the
[1:06:28] water by the word
[1:06:30] and the spirit which is the Holy Spirit
[1:06:35] watching the Holy Spirit confirming the
[1:06:39] word are making the word alive
[1:06:46] you see what he was saying to Nicodemus
[1:06:50] Nicodemus you got a great understanding
[1:06:52] he said you haven't been washed by the
[1:06:55] word Nicodemus would say well what do
[1:06:58] you mean I need to get baptized water
[1:07:00] baptized water I hear that there's a lot
[1:07:02] going on around y'all do with your
[1:07:03] baptisms in time because John is
[1:07:05] baptizing and this is about our innocent
[1:07:08] that wouldn't want Jesus was talking
[1:07:10] about she was took him into a deeper
[1:07:14] depth of washing by the water of the
[1:07:19] word water baptism will not remit your
[1:07:22] sins and we say oh the Bible says
[1:07:27] repented of it and and you show you no
[1:07:29] no and we put a lot of emphasis upon
[1:07:32] water baptism what a baptism will not
[1:07:34] remit your sin it's an answer of a good
[1:07:37] conscience of what something that's
[1:07:39] already taken blood with the washing of
[1:07:41] the water of the word in other words he
[1:07:44] told Nicodemus he said Nicodemus you
[1:07:47] want to know how to be born again I
[1:07:50] won't tell you you need to need to come
[1:07:54] over here ever not for a while and let's
[1:07:56] talk about the word we need to sit down
[1:08:02] and talk about the word and let the word
[1:08:04] wash e we're gonna get into
[1:08:09] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:08:12] of the Holy go the washing of the water
[1:08:14] by the word going up so Nicodemus is
[1:08:16] already offered that point except a man
[1:08:23] be born of the water what does your new
[1:08:29] birth start with washing of the water by
[1:08:33] the word now here's what I've always say
[1:08:38] it and people don't like it if the truth
[1:08:42] is not talked to you you cannot follow
[1:08:44] the truth God has to wink at our
[1:08:47] ignorance a lot of times the bring time
[1:08:49] but what would it be to go somewhere
[1:08:51] that they're not teaching the truth what
[1:08:53] would it be to go to a church in
[1:08:54] listen-only we go to a church today that
[1:08:56] would say oh we know what that is
[1:08:58] washing her water that means water
[1:09:00] baptism that's water baptism you gotta
[1:09:05] truth but you don't have deep truth the
[1:09:09] truth is you got to be washed by the
[1:09:10] water of the word in other words you
[1:09:12] need to sit down shut up and listen for
[1:09:14] a longer water baptism is great and you
[1:09:18] order do it but then you order just sit
[1:09:20] down and listen like you don't put a
[1:09:22] preacher up just cause he's repented and
[1:09:24] send him into pulpit let him start
[1:09:26] preaching no he's a novice he is what do
[1:09:31] you understand being born of the water
[1:09:35] is the washing of the water by the word
[1:09:39] not water baptism well brother dad I've
[1:09:43] done every time well what about the
[1:09:45] washing what about the constant
[1:09:49] listening to the word and letting the
[1:09:52] word clean you out
[1:09:56] he said Nicodemus you need to be washed
[1:10:00] by the water of the word now remember he
[1:10:04] wasn't reading the King James he was
[1:10:07] reading the language that he knew
[1:10:10] Nicodemus knew exactly what Jesus was
[1:10:12] saying but he couldn't follow him in the
[1:10:16] nuber now he can't follow him in the
[1:10:18] washing of the water by the word right
[1:10:23] because he doesn't understand how to
[1:10:25] water how the word could wash you we see
[1:10:32] that's the only cleansing of God the
[1:10:38] only cleansing you got is a washing by
[1:10:40] the water of the word that's a
[1:10:42] justification that's a repentance and
[1:10:44] that's oh you've been washed by the
[1:10:46] water of the word it's all through your
[1:10:48] Christian journey you're being washed by
[1:10:50] the water of the word
[1:10:56] we'll see how that will be if we just
[1:10:58] put it on water baptism
[1:11:03] that's an outward expression supposed to
[1:11:07] be of an inward work this taking plunge
[1:11:09] the washing of the water the word is to
[1:11:11] be inside of you now what about a man
[1:11:15] sitting there that has no marks against
[1:11:17] him and yet the Lord Jesus says you've
[1:11:20] got to be washed by the word in other
[1:11:27] words plain language what was he saying
[1:11:30] to Nicodemus Nicodemus stop preaching
[1:11:35] shut up sit down and listen here's that
[1:11:43] plain enough
[1:11:43] but wouldn't out what he was telling him
[1:11:47] what if Nicodemus Souter said okay now I
[1:11:50] don't understand this about them you
[1:11:53] must be born again I can understand your
[1:11:55] language about what you're saying and I
[1:11:57] know that we were born wrong so I can
[1:12:00] follow you in that line what's your
[1:12:02] meaning maybe I can't follow but I can
[1:12:04] follow you in the line that you're
[1:12:05] telling me I need to to be born from
[1:12:08] above and says now you brought it into a
[1:12:11] greater depth that I don't understand
[1:12:12] how can I be washed by the water of the
[1:12:14] word
[1:12:21] if you don't hear it how can you be
[1:12:22] washed by you see why it's so important
[1:12:25] to hear the truth oh god oh god
[1:12:30] overlooks all that what if he was in a
[1:12:38] church today that believed in this
[1:12:43] message churches that I care I'm here
[1:12:46] with this seed in me and I don't need
[1:12:52] the new birth because it always was
[1:12:53] eternal
[1:13:00] now where would that fit with Nicodemus
[1:13:03] Nicodemus is way higher he's way under
[1:13:07] deeper depth than that because he never
[1:13:08] played nothing like that
[1:13:10] Nicodemus didn't say no wait just a
[1:13:12] minute oh boy I wasn't born in seeing
[1:13:13] like he was born in seeing the mother
[1:13:16] guys could holler that but Nicodemus
[1:13:18] didn't say it because his statement had
[1:13:21] already been made
[1:13:22] no man can do what you do unless God be
[1:13:25] with him and if he was an illegitimate
[1:13:27] bastard born child then God wouldn't be
[1:13:29] dealing with you Nicodemus was a whole
[1:13:33] lot closer than the people of this
[1:13:34] message that say well I was born with
[1:13:37] this seed in me I always was eternal
[1:13:40] then why did Jesus have to come and why
[1:13:46] did he have to tell a man that his life
[1:13:50] was perfect
[1:13:51] no flaws and says look you must be born
[1:13:56] again
[1:13:58] and said now I'm going to tell you a
[1:14:00] little further that you need to sit down
[1:14:02] and listen to the word and let it wash
[1:14:06] you how do we get dark turns out of us
[1:14:16] are you women how you get rid of
[1:14:19] doctrines I just I just repent one of us
[1:14:23] good but now how do you get rid of them
[1:14:24] you study the word and you let the word
[1:14:27] wash those things out of you right is
[1:14:31] that true you let that wash it out of
[1:14:33] you see that'll go all the way through
[1:14:35] your new birth whatever you start with
[1:14:38] this keeps on increasing until it's
[1:14:40] finished I don't mind telling you where
[1:14:43] I'm headed the day we walk off of this
[1:14:45] earth in a rapture you can say I'm born
[1:14:47] again until that time comes you in a
[1:14:53] process you're being born again
[1:14:58] that's no problem but listen see Jesus
[1:15:03] said you must be born from above they
[1:15:11] said brother branham own kinsman
[1:15:12] redeemer we live above the Cosby's
[1:15:15] because we're born from above all
[1:15:17] Christians come from above
[1:15:21] jesus said I'm not from below I'm from
[1:15:25] above you got to be born from above how
[1:15:32] many you need of run around I'm saying
[1:15:34] you must be born from our kingdom is
[1:15:36] above we're born from above then we seek
[1:15:39] the things which are above God being
[1:15:42] misunderstood you see what he's talking
[1:15:46] about that our spirit is born from above
[1:15:50] the 70th week of Daniel it's the Spirit
[1:15:55] of God the Holy Spirit upon us and we
[1:15:57] realized that the Holy Spirit is
[1:15:59] all-powerful when the message why I'm
[1:16:05] against organized religion he they here
[1:16:07] with my words and believeth on him that
[1:16:09] sent me hath eternal life and when he
[1:16:11] turn a life comes in there born from
[1:16:16] above well unless we boy be born again
[1:16:23] spoken word reading the seed except a
[1:16:26] man be born again see Jesus said why
[1:16:28] must we be born again he's dead in the
[1:16:31] flesh that he's in he's a hybrid you
[1:16:36] realize what he was saying to Nicodemus
[1:16:38] he's got to be born again 1 he was born
[1:16:41] in sin from the eve sin shape it in a
[1:16:44] nick would he come to the world speaking
[1:16:45] like he's a liar to begin with no matter
[1:16:49] how smart educated what more he is he's
[1:16:52] a liar the Bible says he is
[1:16:57] you no matter how holy his parents was
[1:16:59] or anything about he's a liar they'll
[1:17:01] begin with the only way he can tell
[1:17:04] truth is to say what truth is
[1:17:07] true they don't live so what is it what
[1:17:11] must you be born again because you were
[1:17:15] born wrong right now go with all these
[1:17:21] messages it's got all these seeds in it
[1:17:24] you know what I'm saying they say I
[1:17:27] don't need the new birth always was
[1:17:29] eternal well there's no salvation for
[1:17:34] him no no I have did it now wait what
[1:17:38] are you saying I'm saying what the Bible
[1:17:40] says you must be born again anybody you
[1:17:47] want from brother branham where he says
[1:17:49] now you don't say you need to be right
[1:17:53] he said it don't say you need to be born
[1:17:56] again he said it must be born again cuz
[1:18:01] if you don't you can't see the kingdom
[1:18:03] what would you need an uber for if you
[1:18:06] had eternal life what would Jesus Christ
[1:18:08] be dying for at Calvary if Nicodemus had
[1:18:12] eternal life come on
[1:18:14] why didn't he say to Nicodemus Nicodemus
[1:18:16] you're the great ruler you're the great
[1:18:18] man you were a teacher all of these
[1:18:19] things you understand these things and
[1:18:21] he always was eternal
[1:18:27] but he didn't say that did he he said I
[1:18:31] was born from above and you must be born
[1:18:37] from he said I died for your sins for
[1:18:42] the world ever begun then you got to
[1:18:44] believe it then you got to repent but
[1:18:48] what did he repent of why did Nick
[1:18:55] además how to repent of come on what did
[1:19:03] he have to repent up he didn't steal he
[1:19:05] didn't cheated enlightened commit
[1:19:06] adultery didn't do that there was
[1:19:08] nothing against him had to be anything
[1:19:09] against him that killed him now what's
[1:19:12] he going to repent
[1:19:19] boy he was a pretty good candidate
[1:19:21] wouldn't it but Jesus never considered
[1:19:24] this fact whether he was a candidate he
[1:19:27] just told him what he had to do
[1:19:29] did you must be born again you got to be
[1:19:34] born from where I've been born from he
[1:19:36] said because they're not see he said I'm
[1:19:38] starting a new Kingdom I'm starting a
[1:19:39] new race I'm starting a new group of
[1:19:41] people not working over the old one to
[1:19:44] repent and just get it all worked up and
[1:19:46] do these things I ain't taking the
[1:19:48] offerings and the things like that I
[1:19:50] remember I used to read that in a
[1:19:52] Baptist Church and I thought what a god
[1:19:53] a God had ordained offerings and things
[1:19:59] and said that's a way for you to contact
[1:20:01] me
[1:20:02] he gets on over there in the word and he
[1:20:05] said your sacrifice and offerings has
[1:20:09] become a stink in my nostrils he said I
[1:20:13] don't care about all these things you do
[1:20:15] he said it's a man with an honest and a
[1:20:18] contrite heart is the one I look to what
[1:20:22] was David on my hand was an honest and a
[1:20:24] contrite heart dirty stinking rascal
[1:20:28] murderer whatever could you call him yet
[1:20:35] God said he's a man after my own heart
[1:20:38] he's God's heart to be a murderer don't
[1:20:41] not not not gly David had an honest and
[1:20:46] a contrite heart Schofield says it
[1:20:49] brought a random verifies that David on
[1:20:51] his way from the bed with Bathsheba
[1:20:53] cries out restore unto me the joy of thy
[1:20:57] salvation sure he was a human being had
[1:21:04] a lot of problems and he had an honest
[1:21:06] and a contrite heart he had a repentant
[1:21:09] heart what does God look for
[1:21:19] I hope you followed the story of the
[1:21:22] illustration Nicodemus laughs you can't
[1:21:26] follow that because Nicodemus over here
[1:21:28] and Jesus didn't do that to lead over on
[1:21:30] the third chapter
[1:21:30] the 14th verse anoonan see you're great
[1:21:33] you really understand not listening to
[1:21:36] the illustration you're listening to
[1:21:39] refute you're not listening to a thought
[1:21:48] the greatest of all read religious
[1:21:51] leaders declaring Jesus to be sin of God
[1:21:57] the car in him to be the teacher
[1:22:01] Jesus says back to him instead of
[1:22:04] bragging on him patting him on the back
[1:22:06] he says Nicodemus you was born wrong you
[1:22:11] know it you know the Scriptures you know
[1:22:13] this the psalmist you know what we'll
[1:22:15] say it you know what all the scriptures
[1:22:16] say it you know something happened in

[1:22:22] you you're no good unless you're born
[1:22:27] from above come along musician what
[1:22:31] about you and I no good unless we're
[1:22:34] born from above yes but I believe
[1:22:40] brothers flowing so called he teaches we
[1:22:42] come here with this eternal seed within

[1:22:48] salvation or anything just go ahead and
