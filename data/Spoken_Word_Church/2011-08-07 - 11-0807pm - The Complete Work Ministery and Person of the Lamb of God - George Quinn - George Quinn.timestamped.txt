[28:27] comes here we always give you an offer
[28:29] to the church
[28:30] but we also every time he comes we
[28:32] always set aside a certain amount of
[28:34] money to give to him
[28:36] to take over to the foreign field and he
[28:38] always gives a report
[28:40] back of where it goes so we don't have
[28:42] to worry about it or he spends it and
[28:43] things like that
[28:44] so was it all right with the church for
[28:46] to give him like a check for fifteen
[28:48] hundred dollars
[28:49] yes all right with everybody any
[28:51] opposition
[28:52] no opposition then we'll give him that

[28:57] does like he said he buys rice he goes
[28:59] in
[29:00] they build do churches and buy things
[29:02] for people bicycles and things
[29:04] and we appreciate it because he travels
[29:06] around a lot right if you can't go
[29:08] just send something that's the best way
[29:10] to do it so let's just sing
[29:12] open the eyes of my heart and brother
[29:13] george quinn comes to be with us
[29:15] and just pray that the lord would bless
[29:17] us and open our understanding right

[32:14] not nothing that's good that's going to
[32:16] be
[32:16] unfamiliar with you but it's just the
[32:18] way we put it together trust it'll be a

[32:58] part of that amen
[33:00] of that giving in john's gospel amen
[33:03] we've been using this a lot over here

[33:09] a a preacher always wants
[33:11] deliverance from what's on his heart
[33:12] another way he's got the burden he wants
[33:15] to give it out
[33:16] and once he's done that that's that's it
[33:18] praise the lord
[33:19] and it says in uh one job this is the
[33:21] gospel of john 9
[33:23] and the first chapter and so i'm sorry
[33:25] maybe
[33:26] i said one joint assistant it's the
[33:28] gospel amen
[33:30] and i'll just give you a second and it
[33:32] says the next day
[33:33] a john saith jesus coming unto him and
[33:35] saith
[33:36] behold the lamb of god which takes away
[33:39] the sin of the world amen
[33:41] this is he of whom i said after me
[33:43] cometh of mine
[33:44] which is preferred before me for he was
[33:47] before me amen
[33:48] and i knew him not but that he should be
[33:51] manifest to israel
[33:52] therefore i might come baptize him with
[33:54] water
[33:55] and john bear record saying i saw
[33:58] the spirit descending from heaven like a
[34:00] dove and it appeared upon him
[34:03] and i knew him not but he that sent me
[34:05] to baptiste with water
[34:07] to see him said unto me upon whom i
[34:10] shall see the spirit descending
[34:12] and remaining on him the same is he
[34:15] which baptizeth with the holy ghost and
[34:18] i saw

[34:22] of god amen praise the lord gracious

[34:43] we've just had our lunches and
[34:45] lord our bodies are the weak part our
[34:48] spirits are willing
[34:49] but lord i just pray that the anointing
[34:51] will be such that dear god you'll carry
[34:53] us all through it
[34:55] lord in the name of jesus christ i ask
[34:57] you that you will bless your word
[34:58] lord may we never forget all the days of
[35:01] our life in the name of jesus christ we

[35:14] amen praise the lord and thank you very
[35:16] much thank you appreciate that very much
[35:19] amen praise the lord uh first of all let
[35:22] me just give a title to it you know
[35:24] brother joe always comes over he wants
[35:25] to get the title of the message
[35:26] and i think a lot of preachers forget to
[35:28] give the title you know right but
[35:30] it's good to give the title okay and uh
[35:32] the title is
[35:33] uh the complete work ministry
[35:37] and person of the lamb of god now notice
[35:40] the word i used there at the beginning
[35:41] the complete work not part of the work
[35:44] the complete work amen and uh to get you
[35:47] this today
[35:48] i've got an awesome task because uh
[35:51] i i preached over india this message and
[35:54] i preached it for two hours
[35:56] and when i got to the end of it i
[35:57] promise you'll not do that today because
[35:59] i just started there and i
[36:00] amen and when i got to the end of it the
[36:03] pastor said to me
[36:04] you may continue if you wish and there
[36:07] that was me preaching for two hours
[36:09] solid hard 400 people drawn it out if
[36:12] you you know
[36:13] and he said but he translated he said
[36:16] you may continue
[36:17] if you wish
[36:23] so so i've had to abbreviate it amen
[36:26] and i've i'm just all i'm going to do is
[36:28] give you the headaches basically
[36:30] so if you i don't want you to go away
[36:32] said i wish that brother said more about
[36:34] this because i can't
[36:35] because you wouldn't get the headaches
[36:37] so that's all i'm going to give you the
[36:38] high points today
[36:39] but praise the lord uh this is a
[36:42] wonderful uh
[36:42] statement i was never spoken like this
[36:44] by anybody
[36:46] john the baptist was the first one that
[36:47] came and said this behold
[36:50] the lamb of god amen that takes away the
[36:52] sons of the world
[36:53] amen and uh you know when i look at our
[36:56] young people
[36:57] and uh praise the lord we were talking
[36:59] about uh our on the internet and
[37:01] putting up our thing on the on the
[37:03] internet and not there but our churches
[37:05] and uh the brother wanted to do it for
[37:07] me uh
[37:08] you know it was all brother brahman you
[37:10] know god's prophet 20th century you know
[37:13] i said brother i don't want to project
[37:14] that just yet right i said i want to
[37:16] tell the people what we believe right
[37:18] now we're christians hallelujah
[37:20] we believe in jesus christ we believe
[37:22] you got to get saved
[37:24] believe you got to be blood washed we
[37:25] believe you've got to get baptized in
[37:27] the name of the lord jesus
[37:28] that's what i want the people to see
[37:29] first hallelujah
[37:31] and then we'll take them all into the
[37:33] the word hallelujah
[37:34] and god sent his prophet amen to this
[37:38] hour
[37:38] but anyway so uh praise the lord
[37:41] when i began to think about that i'd
[37:43] heard a little different snippets here
[37:45] and there
[37:45] of things and i read so many of them
[37:49] and um you know if you think
[37:52] of all the titles that the lord carries
[37:55] you know jesus he must carry many many
[37:57] tapes
[37:58] right and he does he's called the son of
[37:59] god for one right amen the son of man
[38:02] he's also called the alpha and omega the
[38:04] beginning of the end
[38:05] uh it's called the village the valley
[38:07] it's called the brandy morning star
[38:09] he's got many titles but if you look at
[38:12] the title that i just read
[38:13] today there is no greater title in the
[38:16] bible
[38:17] that you will read more than this title
[38:20] the lamb
[38:21] of god all right hallelujah and so that
[38:23] is
[38:24] that is the first thing about it there's
[38:26] no greater title that he ever uses
[38:27] than the lamb of god amen and the reason
[38:30] why i mentioned the internet
[38:31] uh today is because i want to break it
[38:34] down maybe some of our younger people
[38:36] here today
[38:37] uh maybe has never thought of it that
[38:39] but why it would have to be blood
[38:41] why does everything have to die on a
[38:43] blood alarm and a man
[38:45] bloody why does that have to be and a
[38:48] young person could ask that question you
[38:50] see
[38:50] and so amen uh we know
[38:54] that this book is a book of redemption
[38:56] hallelujah we're so glad about that
[38:58] praise god you read the bible and
[39:00] there's hope amen
[39:02] there's redemption in the bible because
[39:03] it's a book of redemption
[39:05] and i've got all these quotes here i can
[39:06] read you a quote after quote of it
[39:08] harder
[39:09] the brother brandon puts it to us amen
[39:11] and uh praise the lord
[39:13] why is it a book of redemption because
[39:15] adam forfeited
[39:17] the title deed to the earth he was lord
[39:20] of this earth amen amen he was lord over
[39:23] it hallelujah
[39:24] amen king whatever you want to call him
[39:26] but he was lord he had
[39:28] complete dominion over all the animals
[39:30] over all the hills
[39:32] he couldn't dominion over everything but
[39:35] he lost it that's like the
[39:36] football term is he fumbled the ball he
[39:39] lost the ball
[39:40] and the ball went back into the hands of
[39:42] the original owner
[39:44] amen and so praise the lord uh amen it
[39:47] went right back there
[39:49] and and that is the thing when he lost
[39:51] the ball and the fall came i want to
[39:53] just give you a little quote in a moment
[39:54] amen uh that i feel i should relate to
[39:57] you
[39:58] amen and ah god had to come down
[40:02] i mean redemption didn't start with mine
[40:04] right redemption started with god
[40:06] hallelujah
[40:07] when he come down and said where are
[40:09] they adam and he said
[40:11] we had believed at least he was honest
[40:12] with god we ought to be honest with god
[40:14] right
[40:15] and he said we had because we were naked
[40:17] and he said who told you
[40:19] that you were naked and they had their
[40:21] little uh uh a thing sewn on that there
[40:23] but god give them coats right and that
[40:25] shows that
[40:26] that that in mine that god had a a a
[40:30] a a greeted purpose hallelujah a greater
[40:33] plan
[40:33] and mine was in a pickle a real pickle
[40:36] i mean when paul writes words like uh
[40:39] that we
[40:40] were without god when we were the third
[40:43] hope hallelujah
[40:44] in this world man i'll tell you you're
[40:46] in the right pickle
[40:48] you are in a bad spot right right but
[40:50] thank god without hope we're talking
[40:52] about hell last night
[40:54] come on you know without god that's hell
[40:56] right
[40:57] hey man it doesn't matter if you're
[40:58] burning or not what are you feeling or
[41:00] you're with that god whatever what a
[41:02] sense that would be american
[41:04] terrible right and so amen and and so
[41:07] here he was
[41:08] and and god makes the little coats i'm
[41:11] going to speak about it
[41:13] in a moment praise the lord and on
[41:15] redemption
[41:16] redemption basically means that uh you
[41:20] were
[41:20] born brought out of the slave market of
[41:23] sin
[41:24] right by the way back in them days
[41:26] that's how much a slave cost
[41:27] would be 30 pieces of silver in the
[41:29] roman day amen and you could buy a
[41:31] person
[41:32] amen ah praise god for that amount of
[41:36] money amen
[41:37] what a terrible thing praise the lord
[41:39] what a terrible thing
[41:40] amen our redemption is buying that
[41:43] person
[41:43] well we were in the slave market of sin
[41:46] we were there amen i i'm not
[41:48] praise god someone paid the price
[41:50] hallelujah
[41:51] someone's saying your pardon amen and
[41:54] you can go free and that's not wonderful
[41:56] i can go free today amen and so
[41:59] uh we know in this uh i i cannot
[42:02] understand how anybody cannot see his
[42:04] servants
[42:06] i mean you can't see that praise god
[42:09] right hallelujah
[42:10] hey you know adam be the son of god amen
[42:13] every seed bringing forth after it's
[42:15] kind of my manhood pops
[42:17] kian amen is he like his daddy a new way
[42:20] he tells lies he's jealous he's got
[42:23] hitler in his heart and eventually
[42:24] murders his brother
[42:25] but i'm just like my daddy he wasn't
[42:27] like because adam was the son of god
[42:29] adam didn't hit anybody adam didn't be
[42:32] jealous of anybody and autumn certainly
[42:33] never
[42:34] murdered anybody so you can see right
[42:36] away that there there's there's a
[42:38] difference here
[42:39] hallelujah where did king come from then
[42:41] have you even read the scripture and see
[42:43] that he's the seventh
[42:44] you tied them all up amen and he's not
[42:46] praise god if you put king into the line
[42:49] i would be the hit from out of it enough
[42:51] idiots we know all these things folks
[42:52] hallelujah
[42:53] still plain but again it has to take god
[42:56] to show people things like that
[42:58] amen but we believe the certainty but
[43:01] here it is and adam has sinned and and
[43:04] and you know it's terrible and brother
[43:07] branham saying here
[43:08] that uh the fall of man necessitated the
[43:12] blood
[43:12] the life sacrifice as a covering percent
[43:15] and i want to read this because i'm
[43:16] going to take my time to do that this is
[43:18] this is reading here but satan could not
[43:21] come through
[43:21] human flesh to make the fall as would
[43:24] christ common human flesh
[43:26] to restore the fallen is not right he
[43:28] ain't no creator okay so we know that
[43:30] but there was an animal the servants so
[43:32] close to man
[43:33] that satan could get into that base and
[43:36] bring the beast
[43:37] to get the human flesh to cause the fall
[43:40] right so we can see that hallelujah
[43:42] right and and inject himself thereby
[43:45] into the human race
[43:46] even as jesus would come one day and
[43:49] inject
[43:49] himself into the human race
[43:57] amen so and he says here um
[44:01] amen let me see and into our human
[44:04] bodies
[44:05] uh even to the extent of a resurrection
[44:08] wherein we would have bodies like his
[44:10] glorious father so i'm glad he's
[44:12] rejected me that much
[44:14] of himself that one day i'll be raised
[44:16] from the day
[44:17] amen just like job praise god now i made
[44:20] mention job i might not at all open
[44:22] now praise the lord and then he says
[44:23] here uh
[44:25] uh he said thus what god worked out in
[44:28] the garden
[44:29] was his predestinative plan and when
[44:31] satan had brought about that which is
[44:33] necessary
[44:34] to the purpose of god for he was a
[44:36] redeemer right he
[44:37] he was a father hallelujah he had
[44:39] attributes he was a savior
[44:41] and they were all going to come out and
[44:42] i saw god let them
[44:44] come about again and so then amen
[44:47] the whole purpose that at that time that
[44:49] man could not get to the tree of life
[44:52] certainly not it wasn't time but
[44:54] anonymous
[44:56] and then he says animal had caused the
[44:58] fall
[44:59] had it not let animal life be shed
[45:02] right so just read on and was taken
[45:06] on his bloodshed and then
[45:09] god had communion with man again so
[45:12] because that servant was an animal
[45:14] and by his blood intermingling he
[45:16] actually uses that term here
[45:18] it was the degradation of humanity by
[45:20] intermingling the seed
[45:22] and so that's the case hallelujah then
[45:25] it would take
[45:26] exactly the same thing that uh
[45:29] that god would use anonymous it would be
[45:31] his blood
[45:32] and it would then come on to the lamb of
[45:35] god
[45:36] amen who would bypass sin who was born
[45:38] sin the same man
[45:40] and then he says i will put enmity
[45:42] against her seed and the serpent seed
[45:44] and they had to wait for that fullness
[45:46] of time
[45:47] god give a propitiation of sin through
[45:50] the shed blood of a lion
[45:51] so i hope that i have explained that to
[45:54] any young person sitting here
[45:55] that it was blood of a beast of a
[45:58] serpent that caused the fall
[46:00] amen and god to start it back on the
[46:03] path
[46:04] he used another little animal amen with
[46:07] its blood an innocent little animal
[46:09] that hadn't done anything itself but it
[46:11] was going to be used and god permitted
[46:13] it
[46:13] to cover sin praise the lord so i just
[46:16] wanted to get
[46:17] i just wanted to get that one out of the
[46:19] road amen praise the lord
[46:21] and uh amen so we see here uh
[46:25] uh that autumn and you know brother
[46:28] branham and i love it
[46:29] hallelujah i mean brother brought him to
[46:32] tell us where we're message believers
[46:34] and god and brother groningen told me
[46:35] that eve's hair was blown and i believe
[46:37] it amen yeah amen
[46:39] hey brother brother says and that's how
[46:41] precious he is to us
[46:43] if we receive a prophet in the name of a
[46:45] prophet we receive a prophet's reward
[46:47] and so i amen for him to tell us
[46:50] that he saw adam and eve leave the
[46:52] garden
[46:54] leave the garden they were told you must
[46:56] leave
[46:57] the garden what a terrible thing to be
[46:59] turned around in the presence of god
[47:01] and said you must leave my presence what
[47:04] a heartache it would be right
[47:05] and i i could warn and describe it but i
[47:09] haven't got the time
[47:10] but it must have been horrible and there
[47:12] was adam and eve cried and holding on to
[47:14] one another and
[47:15] i'm slowly going toward the gate hey man
[47:18] said hot foot we have done that
[47:20] look so a paradise away how can we have
[47:23] done it but they did do it
[47:24] and you say i wouldn't have done it yes
[47:26] you would because you were in adam
[47:28] you see and i was in adam right and and
[47:31] we went that way i i chose our own way
[47:34] amen you shall be as god so my it sounds
[47:37] great doesn't it
[47:38] amen but we will be as gods we are gods
[47:43] praise the lord so so here it is amen
[47:46] and adam had a lamb he had that little
[47:48] coats and he describes it and he's
[47:50] saying about
[47:51] how as he walked out toward that gate
[47:53] crying and weeping and holding on to him
[47:56] and you know there was just a little
[47:57] blood left to fall onto the ground
[48:00] and all of a sudden he said that he
[48:02] heard that lovely
[48:03] loving voice of god saying wait a moment
[48:06] hallelujah
[48:08] wait a moment hallelujah and turn around
[48:10] and say
[48:11] the seed of the woman will embrace the
[48:15] circumcision hallelujah right
[48:16] he might not understood it but he knows
[48:18] there's hope and that i'm going to have
[48:20] i'm going to hold on to that amen and
[48:23] thank god
[48:24] adam amen praise the lord
[48:28] and then uh so the next
[48:32] person we read is evil of course we read
[48:34] him oh come in
[48:35] and uh the lovely thing about it is it
[48:37] was a revelation
[48:39] to evil hallelujah that uh you know his
[48:42] mommy or dad didn't tell him about it
[48:44] brother brown said
[48:45] he said it was god showed him about that
[48:48] serpent scene
[48:49] and and and he knew then that if that's
[48:51] the kiss
[48:52] then it's going to have to be a little
[48:53] animal and that's what he used
[48:56] and it says that evil by faith offered
[48:59] up
[49:00] a better sacrifice amen why because it
[49:03] was god's provided way
[49:05] it had to be a lamb and it had to be a
[49:08] life
[49:08] now why was it not a billy goat or why
[49:11] was it not something else
[49:13] it had to be a lamb i'm never gonna find
[49:16] it why
[49:16] as we go on into it amen and then of
[49:19] course uh as i say we could stop
[49:21] anywhere here and and build it up i've
[49:22] got i got all my notes on it but i'm not
[49:24] doing that until
[49:25] anybody touch the head and so then we
[49:28] come into moses
[49:29] moses passover lamb amen and i think i
[49:32] remember
[49:33] preaching that the conditions for the
[49:35] exodus exactly as they were then
[49:37] god don't change as we said this morning
[49:40] we've got the conditions if you
[49:41] are driving the conditions pastor reid
[49:45] exodus 12 i'd see if you match up right
[49:47] see if you've got your
[49:48] password i don't see if you're right in
[49:50] there amen
[49:52] and then when the call of the league
[49:53] comes you're on your way hallelujah
[49:55] right
[49:56] amen and it was wonderful praise the
[49:58] lord and of course i just uh
[50:00] i overlapped there uh abraham's lamb
[50:03] thank god that
[50:04] when he took off isaac onto the hell i i
[50:07] had more
[50:08] mariah and and you know he said my
[50:11] father i see the
[50:12] the fire right i see the wood where is
[50:15] the sacrifice
[50:16] and he said my son god himself will
[50:20] become the sacrifice and he was
[50:21] hallelujah
[50:23] hallelujah praise god all right you know
[50:26] our friends and i just want to say this
[50:28] i praise the lord when jesus died on
[50:31] calvary and i know brother brother said
[50:33] that the theophany not
[50:35] that it just lifted off and they're in
[50:36] the garden of gethsemane
[50:38] but i'll tell you what then if you're
[50:40] reading what paul said
[50:42] and you think well it said then jesus
[50:43] died for the ungodly it doesn't say that
[50:46] it says in jews season christ
[50:50] died for the ungodly hallelujah because
[50:53] the divine part separates from the human
[50:54] part
[50:55] don't mean that he's a lord figure or
[50:57] anything else he's still the christ
[50:59] he was born the christ he was the christ
[51:01] and he died to christ
[51:03] on the cross of california amen and so
[51:05] there it was and he called the name of
[51:07] the place
[51:08] jehovah jarrah amen right there they
[51:11] built the temple that temple i talked
[51:12] about this morning
[51:13] hallelujah were they the altar was and
[51:16] the sacrifices took place
[51:17] that is where abraham offered that
[51:20] little love and you know it all i
[51:21] couldn't survive up there in the
[51:23] wilderness but god and me alone god
[51:27] gave it to abraham and we can see that
[51:29] the blood was shed and even with
[51:31] with evil harry had the last hand on it
[51:34] my and his little heart beating slower
[51:37] and slower as he took that sharp stone
[51:39] and cut his
[51:40] throat folks i'll tell you what amen
[51:43] calvary's cross
[51:44] cost them a lot it cost them a lot amen
[51:48] and so praise the lord and identifying
[51:50] with it lord god just forgive me and
[51:52] take
[51:53] take this blood and this life of this
[51:55] little lamb in my place
[51:57] and god said i will i'll do it
[51:59] hallelujah
[52:00] you're justified before me but it's only
[52:02] a covering
[52:03] right and so they're covering year by
[52:05] year they have to go back amen
[52:07] praise the lord amen and uh

[52:19] wonderful story

[52:23] brother branham says that god has got
[52:25] confidence in you praise god when you go
[52:27] to the store tomorrow
[52:29] you might hear people cursing and
[52:30] swearing you might i did the other day i
[52:32] walked in the air
[52:33] and there was a couple of people on
[52:34] courses swearing amen
[52:36] i don't hear it often but there they
[52:37] were and uh
[52:39] anything could be going like that there
[52:41] but you're a christian
[52:42] you can hold your head high and god has
[52:45] got confidence
[52:46] in you hallelujah praise the lord he
[52:48] certainly has
[52:49] and he had confidence in job amen and
[52:52] i may say this because maybe one or two
[52:54] may need it today
[52:56] praise the lord that uh
[53:00] we were preaching about uh gideon and uh
[53:03] you know
[53:04] you know the story of gideon i'm sure
[53:05] you do very well but
[53:07] uh the bible says brother brown says
[53:09] that gideon needed
[53:11] extra confidence now sometimes you can
[53:14] get these
[53:14] things for sucking and all that and it

[53:41] you can go home in your car but you can
[53:43] get the absolute confidence
[53:44] that you need he give it to gideon he'll
[53:47] give it to you and i
[53:48] praise the lord and so there was job
[53:51] and you know oh it's terrible when you
[53:53] read it and all those friends and
[53:55] wouldn't
[53:56] have friends you know i remember the
[53:59] night when my wife was sick
[54:00] and i'll tell you what there's one
[54:02] person and
[54:04] knowing that i was down and i was on my
[54:06] knees and i'll tell you what
[54:08] they just beat me with a big stick as if
[54:10] it was my fault
[54:11] right and everything and what are you
[54:12] gonna do wrong oh i would i listen to
[54:15] you

[54:17] david and shimmy i
[54:18] i didn't say nothing i didn't say
[54:20] nothing amen
[54:21] but i'll tell you what amen and that's
[54:23] what his friends were like job's friends
[54:25] but you know again what we said earlier
[54:27] when that inspiration struck
[54:29] job he jumped to his feet and he said i
[54:32] know
[54:33] i know i don't think i know my redeemer
[54:36] lives
[54:51] the funeral service is over for him now
[54:53] maybe it's still going on but about two
[54:55] o'clock
[54:55] on and you know there he's going to
[54:58] stand in this earth
[55:00] again hallelujah matter of fact it
[55:04] doesn't matter hallelujah he's
[55:06] going to stand on the earth again and in
[55:08] my flesh i will see god

[55:16] the blood of allah
[55:17] amen okay praise the lord now
[55:21] well where did it all start you know
[55:23] that's one thing i love about this
[55:24] message

[55:28] the lamb of god you've got to start an
[55:29] eternity
[55:30] right you can't start yesterday before
[55:32] i'll
[55:36] hallelujah right back you know and
[55:38] praise the lord the gods program
[55:40] god's plan of redemption was laid out
[55:43] before
[55:43] the world began now they can say
[55:46] whatever they want if it's two million
[55:47] years over 24 million years old
[55:49] that doesn't bother me at all all i know
[55:51] is that before the world began
[55:54] god had said it the lamb of god right
[55:57] absolutely hard
[55:58] and you know the scripture says that the
[56:02] lamb was slain
[56:03] before the foundation of the world amen
[56:06] he was slain
[56:08] amen i'd love to take a good give him a
[56:09] note and start reading some of these
[56:11] quotes to you
[56:11] but i can't and what would it mean
[56:14] well just basically what it means we
[56:16] were talking about a little bit about
[56:17] the eternal thought
[56:19] that god's not us folks you know even
[56:21] when we're reading
[56:22] revelation 10 7 that angel came down and
[56:24] i believe that with all my heart you
[56:26] know
[56:26] but when you're talking about almighty
[56:27] god where are you going to go that was
[56:29] president right there
[56:30] right you know people want to go and
[56:31] they want to send out something that
[56:33] mars
[56:34] i don't know why yeah and even i i i
[56:37] seen a documentary at one time
[56:38] they said even if they were there they
[56:40] only stayed about a dozen years they'd
[56:41] have to come back
[56:42] they will have to come back so what was
[56:44] all a lot about
[56:46] going up to mars he wants to go to mars
[56:47] you know but i know one thing
[56:49] if you went to mars i bet you could feel
[56:51] the spirit of god on you if you're a
[56:52] christian
[56:53] all right because he's everywhere
[56:54] hallelujah bless the lord amen
[56:57] and here the lamb was slain before the
[56:59] foundation of the world in god's mind
[57:02] the eternal god hallelujah god's not
[57:05] like us
[57:05] he doesn't have to leave somewhere to go
[57:07] somewhere else amen but that's language
[57:09] that we understand
[57:10] so therefore we use it amen and so
[57:13] praise god
[57:13] here is he was an eternal thought of god
[57:16] amen
[57:17] and it was determined that christ would
[57:20] be that lamb
[57:21] hallelujah no knowing all that was going
[57:24] the whole thing was going to be larry
[57:25] how the earth would be created
[57:27] amen and all it would be put on it that
[57:29] he would sin that he would need the
[57:30] little coats
[57:31] then he would have the revelation and
[57:33] abraham moses would have the revelation
[57:35] the pastor of the lamb
[57:36] and it would come right on down to his
[57:38] son and so praise god
[57:40] he was saying in the mind of god and
[57:43] when it's like that sister apparently
[57:44] it's done
[57:45] right with god once he thinks that
[57:47] that's it
[57:48] praise god amen once he speaks of
[57:50] hallelujah you'll never
[57:52] that's why folks when when we have thus
[57:54] served the lord on this country
[57:56] i tell you there's no hope right right
[57:58] there is no hope there's no hope for
[57:59] ireland
[58:00] there's no hope for the west right
[58:02] hallelujah we're on the course
[58:03] and abraham lincoln and george
[58:05] washington and every
[58:07] they would not turn this nation back
[58:08] today and you know exactly
[58:10] praise god so it's been spoken
[58:12] hallelujah goodbye california

[58:17] part
[58:19] so praise god where did i come from then

[58:23] fellow here and uh
[58:25] remember where did i come from or
[58:27] brother where did i tell you what i came
[58:29] from the mind of god
[58:30] right hey man as a matter of fact i will
[58:31] give you a little thought and you can
[58:33] do whatever you want with it but you
[58:34] know i was reading
[58:36] and it said that if you look at when god
[58:39] said to moses
[58:40] i am that i am sending you tell them
[58:43] that
[58:44] the lord god has sent you amen
[58:48] and you know we know jehovah i'm not
[58:50] just explaining it like this
[58:51] that word for for for ram there i am
[58:54] that word is the same that mo that when
[58:58] moses when god said so down your rod
[59:00] it's exactly the same word it is that
[59:03] became
[59:04] a serpent it's exactly the same word as
[59:06] i am i
[59:07] am you say that i sent you so what is he
[59:09] saying what's in that
[59:10] it became something okay so he said
[59:14] i became what i've become right okay i
[59:17] i'm the lord your god amen right
[59:19] and that's what we've always known about
[59:20] jehovah he's the self-revealing god we
[59:23] know that
[59:24] that's he's the self-revealing god but
[59:26] what did he become
[59:28] folks he became his own thoughts hey
[59:34] that's the truth he became his own
[59:36] thoughts what he was thinking
[59:38] and his mind he determined to do and he
[59:40] did it
[59:41] that's wonderful amen and that's what he
[59:43] was trying to tell moses
[59:45] i'm i'm going to become my own thoughts
[59:46] right when i thought it went back and
[59:48] eternally i'm going to do it hallelujah
[59:50] and that's why christ was sacrificed and
[59:52] the lamb
[59:53] slain right in god's mind before
[59:56] the word began but listen i may throw
[59:58] this three but in here and i'm watching

[1:00:16] for
[1:00:17] right right the elect that's the way he

[1:01:48] savior

[1:01:52] he was
[1:01:54] now why alone why alone
[1:01:57] well you know we should be able to
[1:01:58] figure out it ourselves because
[1:02:01] amen of its nature right amen but you
[1:02:04] know when god made an eagle and he was
[1:02:06] going to take you a sad eagle he made
[1:02:08] that eagle that way so if you could take
[1:02:11] yourself in to be the need amen and when
[1:02:14] he made a salmon
[1:02:15] and whatever it is praise god on the
[1:02:18] rainbow trout
[1:02:19] and when he made a lamb it was because
[1:02:21] it had a nature
[1:02:23] and carried in nature would express his
[1:02:25] thoughts
[1:02:26] amen and that's what he did and it was a
[1:02:29] praise of the lord
[1:02:30] uh represented his own characteristics
[1:02:32] bless the lord and it was a gentile
[1:02:35] a gentle natured meek praise the lord
[1:02:39] uh little fella and i must say we'll
[1:02:42] take it back home
[1:02:43] we have our sheep my wife loves them
[1:02:46] and we have the little lambs and we have
[1:02:49] a few horses
[1:02:50] and there's one that doesn't like it
[1:02:52] like any of us nearly well
[1:02:53] she actually like said sarah but you
[1:02:55] know even me going by
[1:02:57] and i stop brother samuel and talk to
[1:02:59] the horse and i say

[1:03:10] and you see i know what you ever do yeah
[1:03:13] i know what it tastes like
[1:03:15] and that's what she's like and we were
[1:03:17] standing there one day and of course
[1:03:19] jonathan thought he was going to prove
[1:03:20] me wrong
[1:03:21] and so he said oh no no no amber's all
[1:03:23] right you know what i'm good
[1:03:24] now i know she's already turned you put
[1:03:26] him here
[1:03:27] he was black and blue
[1:03:32] i suppose but i wish it wasn't right but
[1:03:34] anyway amen
[1:03:36] but you know i lied hold on you can live
[1:03:39] a million years i'll tell you what
[1:03:40] not one person will come up and say to
[1:03:42] you boy that lamp hit me there did you
[1:03:44] see that that long but
[1:03:45] no alarm will not beat you alarm is
[1:03:48] gentle
[1:03:48] right it's forgiving and it's trusting
[1:03:51] oh
[1:03:51] my goodness there's not much trust in
[1:03:53] this alarm you know you can pick it up
[1:03:55] off its mother and it'll just put his
[1:03:56] little head in here and i'll go ah
[1:03:58] and you'll be stroking it so so lovely
[1:04:02] and that in god's mind he said that i'm
[1:04:04] gonna make that little animal because it
[1:04:06] will it will be
[1:04:07] my characteristics and people will be
[1:04:09] able to type it against me
[1:04:11] and that's why it was the lamb of god
[1:04:12] that's why i had to be a lamb that's why
[1:04:14] it had to be blood
[1:04:15] and i hope you've all got that today i'm
[1:04:16] sure the older ones have amen praise the
[1:04:18] lord
[1:04:19] amen in the fullness of time praise god
[1:04:21] and of course
[1:04:22] there was the alarm and the dove and as
[1:04:24] the prophet said you ain't going to get
[1:04:26] that dub down
[1:04:27] if you don't have alarm right nature
[1:04:28] praise the lord and you know also
[1:04:30] if you just run it on i'm getting ahead
[1:04:32] of myself here but
[1:04:33] if you run around folks and you get into
[1:04:36] the 19th chapter of the book of
[1:04:38] revelation it says it says the lamb's
[1:04:41] wife
[1:04:42] and the lamb and it says for his wife
[1:04:45] it's going to be a
[1:04:46] lamb so i tell you what i have no time
[1:04:50] for a christian not you know
[1:05:00] i'm listening to them they're as hard as
[1:05:01] anything you know what i mean shooting
[1:05:03] from the
[1:05:03] bang bang bang where's that in the
[1:05:06] scripture where's that in the lord's
[1:05:07] nature
[1:05:08] praise god hallelujah we don't need that
[1:05:10] amen
[1:05:12] hallelujah and the holy ghost dove will
[1:05:14] lead us
[1:05:15] but you've got to have that nature today
[1:05:17] right and you should have and i'm sure
[1:05:18] you do have
[1:05:19] on you today praise the lord and the
[1:05:22] bible says
[1:05:23] and he was led as a
[1:05:26] lamb before her shearers was done
[1:05:30] he opened not his mouth wow what a
[1:05:33] wonderful savior we have
[1:05:35] and and our praise the lord that's just
[1:05:37] that's just getting into that
[1:05:38] i better get on fairly much here the
[1:05:41] lamb of god
[1:05:43] comes into full view and you know he was
[1:05:45] presented at the river jordan
[1:05:47] that's where he came now brown said he
[1:05:49] could march him during the banker with
[1:05:50] uh
[1:05:50] with with uh uh uh was it lazarus
[1:05:54] i mean martha's brother hey that's this
[1:05:56] is his friend
[1:05:57] they marched down i don't know if
[1:05:58] blasters keep updates and brother
[1:06:00] brother didn't say
[1:06:01] but i know jesus did hallelujah amen
[1:06:03] praise the lord
[1:06:04] and he was introduced john was willing
[1:06:07] he knew something was going to happen
[1:06:08] and he was waiting for the sign and he
[1:06:10] was there about passing away
[1:06:12] and that's sometimes when god comes to
[1:06:13] you when you're just maybe not fully
[1:06:15] aware
[1:06:16] and then he sits on the scene and here
[1:06:18] he was and he introduced in the song
[1:06:20] but not only that he saw him but he saw
[1:06:23] the sign
[1:06:24] hallelujah to see him with brother
[1:06:25] branham they're parallel so much
[1:06:27] hallelujah i don't look at the mind if
[1:06:29] you wish not the look of the mind
[1:06:31] but look at the sign hallelujah but
[1:06:33] where did it ever feel
[1:06:35] amen it never failed okay and praise the
[1:06:38] lord the same was the spirit of god
[1:06:40] descending on christ and he announced
[1:06:43] him
[1:06:44] to the world hallelujah that's what john
[1:06:46] was to do announcing to the world
[1:06:48] and uh that's what he did and he saw the
[1:06:51] prophet said he saw
[1:06:53] the pillar of fire in the shape of a
[1:06:55] dove come down
[1:06:56] hanging over uh the lord jesus amen man
[1:07:00] and there was the voice and folks i'll
[1:07:02] tell you what
[1:07:03] you know a lot of people even over time
[1:07:06] over and over
[1:07:06] vietnam they were asking me about that
[1:07:08] trying to prove a trinity
[1:07:09] by this story that there was the sun in
[1:07:12] the water the holy ghost is like a dove
[1:07:14] and the father speaks their strength
[1:07:16] amen well i'll tell you what that's a
[1:07:17] bad very bad interpretation you're
[1:07:19] putting on the word
[1:07:20] hallelujah it came down like a pillar of
[1:07:22] fire over him
[1:07:23] and right out of the middle of that part
[1:07:25] of our voice spoke and spoke unto the
[1:07:27] birth of jesus
[1:07:28] christ this is my beloved son and whom i
[1:07:30] am pleased to dwell
[1:07:32] hallelujah and there he was amen and our
[1:07:34] praise god
[1:07:35] uh the the the father amen and the son
[1:07:39] bless the lord and he's receiving the
[1:07:41] spirit without measure
[1:07:43] right he did he needed that praise god
[1:07:45] and his humanity
[1:07:47] amen we know that when jesus was on the
[1:07:49] boat
[1:07:50] he he's a human being he had to eat he
[1:07:53] had to sleep he had to
[1:07:55] that's right but you know when he stood
[1:07:57] up there and spoke hallelujah
[1:07:59] that was god and we know right bless the
[1:08:01] lord amen
[1:08:02] and so here he was and he received that
[1:08:05] and you know
[1:08:06] the thing about it is the sacrifice had
[1:08:09] to be watched
[1:08:10] had to be washed amen and it was only
[1:08:14] symbolic with him he had nothing to be
[1:08:15] washed for
[1:08:16] but because he was fulfilling the law he
[1:08:18] fulfilled that and he was wise
[1:08:20] amen praise god before uh god and not
[1:08:23] only that there but if you even go back
[1:08:25] into the uh description of the high
[1:08:28] priest in the old testament
[1:08:29] that man was washed first then he was
[1:08:32] anointed with oil
[1:08:34] and then he was in his office hallelujah
[1:08:36] praise god
[1:08:37] of the high priest and i'm not saying
[1:08:40] jesus was watched
[1:08:41] he was anointed by the holy ghost the
[1:08:42] third measure with third measure
[1:08:45] and praise god and he's in his office
[1:08:47] he's read among them he's the son of god
[1:08:49] in his office hallelujah
[1:08:50] all right the son of man whatever way
[1:08:52] you want to look at but there he is
[1:08:54] amen he's god's chosen place of worship
[1:08:56] now and the whole sin question is
[1:08:58] settled
[1:08:59] here is the law there's no other way
[1:09:02] this is the one amen praise god thank
[1:09:06] god for that
[1:09:07] and the lovely thing about it is we will
[1:09:09] know i want to just get on very quickly
[1:09:10] here
[1:09:11] that in the old testament when that
[1:09:14] little animal when you identified was
[1:09:17] yourself with it
[1:09:18] and god accepted that as a covering for
[1:09:20] your sin
[1:09:22] but we know that the life of that animal
[1:09:24] couldn't come back on the believer right
[1:09:26] it's only a little animal
[1:09:27] right right so that's all it is come on
[1:09:30] brother praise the lord
[1:09:32] amen i was talking to one of our horses

[1:10:07] the whole thing
[1:10:08] all throughout ten years four thousand
[1:10:09] years or whatever it was that
[1:10:11] the blood the life couldn't come back
[1:10:12] from the believer you see
[1:10:14] but thank god when you get in touch with
[1:10:17] islam
[1:10:18] when you identify with islam hallelujah
[1:10:20] as your sacrifice
[1:10:22] his life comes back on you when you make
[1:10:25] that identification
[1:10:26] as the lamb of god you understand that
[1:10:28] praise god is wonderful hallelujah
[1:10:30] amen and i'm glad in the form of the
[1:10:33] holy ghost he comes back on the believer
[1:10:35] amen
[1:10:35] and the sharing of his blood we will
[1:10:38] never cease
[1:10:39] to sing about the blood halloween amen

[1:11:28] and and enlarge that man but the time is
[1:11:30] just flying by us here
[1:11:32] and so praise god i just want to bring
[1:11:34] into something else now amen
[1:11:36] and just carry on because i i don't even
[1:11:39] think apophis could preach that
[1:11:41] today he could get some of it but he
[1:11:43] wouldn't get all of what i told you
[1:11:44] already this afternoon i want you to
[1:11:46] know amen you didn't even teach it what
[1:11:47] you know
[1:11:48] to be the truth praise the lord amen but
[1:11:51] when we come into uh
[1:11:55] read into our day amen and
[1:11:58] we see that brother brown i'm amen uh
[1:12:00] he's talking here
[1:12:02] and he says uh everything has happened
[1:12:04] just exactly
[1:12:05] he said i may not do it but this message
[1:12:08] will introduce jesus christ to the world
[1:12:10] for as john the baptist was sent to
[1:12:13] forerun the first coming so so this
[1:12:14] message
[1:12:15] for on the second coming amen and john
[1:12:18] said
[1:12:18] i behold the lamb of god you say that
[1:12:21] takes away the sins of the word
[1:12:22] say he says it's paralleled in every way
[1:12:25] now we know that
[1:12:26] you can take john he's the elijah the
[1:12:28] same as john the baptist was elijah
[1:12:30] john fulfilled what what luke 1 2
[1:12:33] whatever the
[1:12:34] chapters are but angel said zacharias
[1:12:36] amy fulfilled it but he didn't fulfill
[1:12:39] turning the hearts off the of us back to
[1:12:41] the candy court the children back to the
[1:12:43] pentecostal father he
[1:12:44] john never fulfilled that that's it
[1:12:46] that's clear
[1:12:47] so so this election would have to do it
[1:12:49] amen and he did it hallelujah
[1:12:51] and it's paralleled in every way john 4
[1:12:53] on the first coming he would for on the
[1:12:55] second coming
[1:12:56] it's parallel and every way amen
[1:12:59] and so praise the lord let me just get
[1:13:01] down yes as john was sent forth
[1:13:03] with a message the first coming he'd do
[1:13:05] the second coming
[1:13:06] and he said oh will this be the time
[1:13:09] behold the lamb of god you say this is
[1:13:11] what he said now i want you just to age
[1:13:12] into this thought here amen
[1:13:14] praise the lord and uh
[1:13:17] let me see notice he said the word
[1:13:20] came to the prophet and this
[1:13:22] dispensation of grace in the water right
[1:13:25] well i'll tell you what i was listening
[1:13:26] let's keep preaching i thought it was
[1:13:28] nice
[1:13:28] because he said the word comes to the
[1:13:30] prophet
[1:13:32] then the spirit comes to the word right
[1:13:34] i thought that was nice
[1:13:35] and that's exactly what happened in
[1:13:38] jordan's river
[1:13:39] praise god right say the word came to
[1:13:41] the prophet and then
[1:13:42] the spirit came to the word hallelujah
[1:13:44] and led him off into the wilderness
[1:13:46] amen never changes and it's going to be
[1:13:48] the same and so notice
[1:13:50] that this dispensation of grace which he
[1:13:53] was ushering in greece right from this
[1:13:55] moment
[1:13:55] amen was in the water and then brother
[1:13:58] brown says
[1:13:59] no he said i thought you would catch it
[1:14:00] uh-huh and the water
[1:14:02] the first revelation of the word was in
[1:14:05] the water
[1:14:06] now you see where the bride started oh
[1:14:09] yes
[1:14:10] and where it started now we certainly
[1:14:11] started back in the men to god
[1:14:13] but actually in physical manifestation
[1:14:16] this is what he's saying
[1:14:17] he's saying it started hallelujah
[1:14:20] the first revelation was in the water in
[1:14:23] 1933 without being killer park him down
[1:14:26] hallelujah and
[1:14:29] i think that's true i think as far as i
[1:14:31] understand that right so amen
[1:14:33] and it says you see where the bride
[1:14:36] started
[1:14:37] that's that's it this is it you're on
[1:14:39] your way right right
[1:14:41] is calm hallelujah and the word's coming
[1:14:44] to the prophet
[1:14:45] and the messages started and the pride
[1:14:47] is going to be on the scene
[1:14:49] and he said you see where the bride
[1:14:51] started you see
[1:14:52] the evening light message started
[1:14:56] in the water right that's what he says
[1:14:58] and it's the truth
[1:14:59] that's exactly that's john because he's
[1:15:01] parallel exactly
[1:15:02] and every way the word the true word not
[1:15:05] mixed up with creeds
[1:15:06] or denominations but come to the prophet
[1:15:09] in the water hallelujah
[1:15:10] nine amen and he says i hope he said
[1:15:14] well i'll just read this
[1:15:15] if i may he said i hope you'll try my
[1:15:16] ministry with this
[1:15:18] of letting me take the close of his word
[1:15:20] address his bride
[1:15:22] well thank god he's done it amen you

[1:16:08] that day
[1:16:08] and say behold the lamb of god that
[1:16:10] takes away the sins of the world
[1:16:12] not right but i want to take you
[1:16:13] somewhere else here just in a moment
[1:16:15] praise the lord i'm just going to go
[1:16:17] very very quick
[1:16:19] and he says at the end time prophecies
[1:16:22] will repeat
[1:16:24] i believe as the first forerunner came
[1:16:26] in the wilderness and cried behold the
[1:16:28] lamb of god
[1:16:29] the second forerunner will do the same
[1:16:32] by pointing the people to the word born
[1:16:35] bright
[1:16:36] amen right then this is what he says
[1:16:38] this is where the difference is
[1:16:39] see because we can't go back to the
[1:16:41] river jordan amen i mean i can't take
[1:16:43] these all back there and baptize

[1:16:48] already been in the river jordan amen

[1:16:51] see and uh i'll just mention what the
[1:16:54] priest said in a moment

[1:26:43] bless the lord now
[1:26:45] and i just want to get on here and it
[1:26:47] says here
[1:26:48] and when john looked to see the land he
[1:26:50] saw a lamb
[1:26:51] all the way through the bible it
[1:26:53] couldn't be a lot he wasn't lying when
[1:26:54] he died he was the land of the tribe of
[1:26:56] judah it certainly was
[1:26:57] he come back as the land of the tribe of
[1:26:58] jesus certainly will but he was the lamb
[1:27:03] and of god going to change folks he was
[1:27:05] the lamb of god then
[1:27:07] before the foundation of the word he's
[1:27:08] the lamb of god right now in this story
[1:27:10] amen and john looks to see a lie and he
[1:27:13] sees this lamb
[1:27:15] amen my brother brother says it wasn't
[1:27:18] it was not an animal see he took the
[1:27:21] book
[1:27:22] amen and praise god that here he is
[1:27:25] and he's got seven horns amen
[1:27:28] and seven eyes now amen we're not just

[1:27:33] prison when i sit here some people type
[1:27:34] and you know what i mean two flies run
[1:27:36] up the wall and type
[1:27:37] you don't do that amen praise god
[1:27:40] there's no type of that for us
[1:27:41] but you know something there's a type
[1:27:42] right here when i talk about seven eyes
[1:27:45] and i know that's the seven churches
[1:27:46] messengers that's who i know that is
[1:27:48] that you've talked about it in zechariah
[1:27:50] amen and the seven horns seven powers

[1:28:18] minutes trying
[1:28:18] to die now just think about this
[1:28:22] my mind here's adam adam couldn't even
[1:28:24] open the book he needed the king's man
[1:28:26] redeemer himself
[1:28:27] so he couldn't do it amen nobody could

[1:28:33] stopped

[1:28:41] a man amen the albeit a glorified man
[1:28:44] he's got the book in his heart wonderful
[1:28:47] now
[1:28:48] and just in a brief way of saying it
[1:28:50] that means there's hope for the human
[1:28:51] race
[1:28:52] when he shed his precious blood every
[1:28:54] drop of it wrecked on the cross
[1:28:56] and into the ground it speaks to me and
[1:28:58] it says like evil's blood
[1:29:00] amen and it speaks that there's hope on

[1:29:05] has flowed on it

[1:29:33] twenty elders
[1:29:34] and all the beasts and they all fell
[1:29:36] down before the lamb
[1:29:38] and they all had hearts as prison
[1:29:40] worship and golden vials full of odors
[1:29:43] which are the prayers of the saints god
[1:29:46] is very particular about his sins
[1:29:48] prayers

[1:49:26] whatever come and let's pray for you
[1:49:28] and then we'll go right on into the
[1:49:30] communion okay
[1:49:45] heard a great message
[1:50:08] he
[1:50:22] lovely
[1:50:36] is
[1:50:49] you would
[1:50:52] it's all up you're ready for you but to
[1:50:54] feel common
[1:50:58] first corinthians 11 23
[1:51:01] forever received of the lord that which
[1:51:03] also i delivered unto you
[1:51:05] that the lord jesus the same night in
[1:51:07] which he was betrayed took bread
[1:51:09] and when he had given thanks he broke it
[1:51:11] and said take e this is my body which is
[1:51:13] broken for you
[1:51:15] this is due in remembrance of me after
[1:51:17] the same manner also he took the cup
[1:51:19] when he ends up saying
[1:51:20] this cup is the new testament in my
[1:51:22] blood
[1:51:23] this do ye as often as you drink it in
[1:51:26] remembrance of me
[1:51:27] for as often as you eat this bread and
[1:51:30] drink this cup you do shoe the lord's
[1:51:32] death till he come wherefore whosoever
[1:51:34] shall eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:51:37] of the lord
[1:51:37] unworthily she will be guilty of the
[1:51:39] body and blood of the lord
[1:51:41] but let a man examine himself and shall
[1:51:43] let him eat of that blood and drink
[1:51:45] let him eat of that bread and drink of
[1:51:48] that cup
[1:51:49] for he that eateth and drinketh unworthy
[1:51:51] eateth and drinketh damnation to himself
[1:51:53] not discerning the lord's body
[1:51:55] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:51:57] among you and many sleep
[1:51:59] for we would judge ourselves we should
[1:52:01] not be judged now we'd love this
[1:52:03] scripture
[1:52:03] amen but when we are judged
[1:52:07] you know we're guilty we've done
[1:52:09] something yeah
[1:52:10] we're judged
[1:52:14] then we're chasing by the lord to keep
[1:52:16] them from having to be destroyed
[1:52:18] or we'll repent see all right so but
[1:52:20] when we
[1:52:21] are judged we're chasing to the lord
[1:52:24] that we should not be condemned with the
[1:52:25] world
[1:52:25] we're for my brethren when you come
[1:52:27] together to eat tarry one for another
[1:52:29] and if any man hungry let him eat at
[1:52:31] home that you come out together in the
[1:52:32] condemnation
[1:52:34] and the rest will i sit in order when i
[1:52:36] come
[1:52:37] now let's just take a few moments and
[1:52:39] it's just anybody has anything
[1:52:41] to get out of the way before we take the
[1:52:43] communion then the all
[1:52:45] is always open and things and just so if
[1:52:48] there's any
[1:52:49] problems in something you say forgive me
[1:52:52] you know
[1:52:52] whatever
[1:52:56] if not all mine's clear then let's take
[1:52:59] a few moments to just have a silent
[1:53:01] prayer before we
[1:53:02] go on into the rest of the service
[1:53:21] we thank you for your loving grace and
[1:53:23] to us lord we thank you for all things
[1:53:25] and you said you give them unto us
[1:53:26] freely
[1:53:27] so we don't have to work for them we
[1:53:29] don't have to pay for them not do
[1:53:30] anything
[1:53:31] all we got to do is receive we thank you
[1:53:34] we love you and we ask you to just
[1:53:36] guide us now and open our understanding
[1:53:39] because in doing that then
[1:53:40] lord we can walk in the light of your
[1:53:42] love forgive our sins
[1:53:44] lead us all by thy grace in jesus name
[1:53:48] amen the bible said he took bread and
[1:53:52] blessed it
[1:53:54] father we thank you for this bread it
[1:53:56] was made for this purpose today
[1:53:58] and only for this purpose was it made
[1:54:01] yes we ask you that you would just
[1:54:02] sanctify the bread we know this is not
[1:54:04] the body
[1:54:06] but it is in yes we've seen people
[1:54:08] healed even taking communion
[1:54:11] because it isn't something about the
[1:54:13] remembrance and things that you told us
[1:54:15] to do
[1:54:16] you told us to do this until you come
[1:54:18] well some stop because they believe
[1:54:20] you're here but the next thing we do is
[1:54:23] have it at the marriage supper so
[1:54:24] what's the problem we're still taking it
[1:54:26] now lord we love you and we thank you
[1:54:28] and commit everything into your hands
[1:54:30] sanctify the food and the partakers in
[1:54:33] jesus name
[1:54:47] he said this is the broken body it
[1:54:49] wouldn't
[1:54:50] it wasn't a round wiper their brother
[1:54:53] was talking about it
[1:54:55] right around wafer then there's no need
[1:54:58] of it ever being around white right
[1:55:01] it wouldn't wouldn't that way but you
[1:55:03] see that's what people have been taught
[1:55:06] and you know they swear by it and
[1:55:08] they'll do everything they can to try to
[1:55:10] back it up and
[1:55:12] you know even die for it and it being
[1:55:15] wrong
[1:55:17] but yet thank god for the truth amen
[1:55:20] thank god for the truth that's
[1:55:23] that's the main thing you shall know the
[1:55:26] truth
[1:55:27] yes and the truth will set you
[1:55:31] that's free
[1:55:35] i told you about when was in the badges
[1:55:37] we used to order the bread from the
[1:55:39] publishing house we'd keep it every
[1:55:41] three months we just put it back in the
[1:55:42] freezer and
[1:55:43] pull it back out in three months and
[1:55:47] you know of course we believed in we
[1:55:49] wasn't catholics
[1:55:51] but what we believed was the same thing
[1:55:54] yeah
[1:55:56] father we thank you for this line this
[1:55:58] went through the process of aging
[1:56:00] it's now getting better each day because
[1:56:02] it's the top of our blood
[1:56:03] yes that was shed for each and every one
[1:56:05] of us and lord as we eat this natural
[1:56:08] little piece of bread
[1:56:09] and we drank this little sip of wine yes
[1:56:11] we know and for surety that tomorrow
[1:56:14] it will be blood cells in our body from
[1:56:16] a creation of a way that you made for
[1:56:18] these things to be
[1:56:20] lord but we know too that the opening of
[1:56:23] our word is what we desire
[1:56:25] the stimulation of revelation that the
[1:56:28] prophet spoke of
[1:56:29] that's what we desire come and quicken
[1:56:31] the word towards one of our hearts and
[1:56:33] lives
[1:56:34] forgive our sins and cleanse us from all
[1:56:36] run righteousness
[1:56:38] lead us in jesus name amen
[1:56:46] come morning and i'll walk
[1:56:51] by the river
[1:57:03] i'll carry my cross
[1:57:07] through the midnight
[1:57:11] a morning
[1:57:16] for me
[1:57:19] sometimes i'm despised
[1:57:35] then i take one
[1:57:50] come
[1:58:04] free i'll
[1:58:07] carry my cross
[1:58:11] through the midnight
[1:58:18] comedy
[1:58:22] you know every day that we get older you
[1:58:25] know we get one
[1:58:26] day closer to eternity
[1:58:29] it's not a problem then for if i was
[1:58:32] wishing for anything everybody wants to
[1:58:34] back up in time you know they'd like a
[1:58:36] little time machine to
[1:58:37] step in back up you know into some other
[1:58:40] age or something or even back
[1:58:41] up 20 years or back up 40 years or 50
[1:58:44] years or something
[1:58:45] you know if i had my choice i'd want to
[1:58:47] advance
[1:58:49] you know why because if it was possible
[1:58:53] to advance i'd be closer to eternity
[1:58:56] you know i mean i want to go that way i
[1:58:58] don't want to get young
[1:58:59] i've enjoyed being a human being and had
[1:59:02] a wonderful time in life and god has
[1:59:04] given me
[1:59:04] you know gave me good health to bring me
[1:59:07] to the place i'm in
[1:59:08] and all and i really enjoyed it and i
[1:59:11] don't want to go backwards
[1:59:13] let's go forward just step on over into
[1:59:16] eternity
[1:59:17] and they'll all be overwhelmed because
[1:59:19] it'll be a wonderful day
[1:59:21] but i'm enjoying now amen amen
[1:59:25] you know i'm enjoying now the opening of
[1:59:28] god's word
[1:59:29] because i'm like you know
[1:59:33] that
[1:59:36] i'm getting my food now
[1:59:40] to be able to understand when i get
[1:59:43] there
[1:59:46] and i'm like little rebecca wood i'm
[1:59:48] just listening to isaac
[1:59:50] i mean to ella easier tell me all about
[1:59:53] isaac
[1:59:55] because she knew as i said the other day
[1:59:57] of so much about him until
[1:59:59] she didn't have to you know look around
[2:00:01] she just did
[2:00:03] that and like i said she didn't
[2:00:07] she was after riding a camel for three
[2:00:09] months
[2:00:10] she probably didn't smell too good she
[2:00:13] probably didn't look too good
[2:00:16] because she was you know she'd been
[2:00:18] doing that day in and day out
[2:00:21] but she wasn't concerned about that
[2:00:24] right what she was concerned about it
[2:00:26] was to see her husband
[2:00:29] she never had any thoughts whether she
[2:00:31] would be accepted or not
[2:00:34] you know never in no way did she have
[2:00:37] any conception
[2:00:38] that she wouldn't or any fear for
[2:00:40] anything that she was not going to be
[2:00:42] accepted right
[2:00:44] because they're easier done told her
[2:00:47] all is well our prophet has told us all
[2:00:51] as well
[2:00:52] i call you bride he says
[2:00:55] that's wonderful to be called a bride
[2:00:58] jesus called him friends
[2:01:01] he said i don't don't i don't call you
[2:01:03] servants and things anymore
[2:01:04] he said i call you friend right all
[2:01:07] right
[2:01:08] let's see the prophet said i call you
[2:01:10] bride
[2:01:12] because that's what we are that's it
[2:01:14] right amen
[2:01:15] amen
[2:01:21] let's all predict again
[2:01:36] you can be seated for a minute while
[2:01:37] we're getting through with the
[2:01:39] reading of the scriptures going into the
[2:01:42] foot washing
[2:01:44] you know john the
[2:01:48] 13th chapter and supper being ended the
[2:01:52] devil having now put into the heart of
[2:01:54] judas's carrot simon's
[2:01:56] son to betray him jesus knowing that the
[2:01:58] father had given all things into his
[2:01:59] hands and that he was come from god and
[2:02:02] went to god
[2:02:04] he rises from supper and laid aside his
[2:02:06] garments and took a towel and girded
[2:02:07] himself
[2:02:09] after that he poured water into a basin
[2:02:11] and began to wash the disciples feet and
[2:02:12] to wipe them with the towel wherewith he
[2:02:14] was girded
[2:02:15] then cometh he to simon peter and peter
[2:02:17] said unto him lord does thou wash my
[2:02:19] feet
[2:02:20] jesus answered and said unto him what i
[2:02:22] do i know it's not now
[2:02:25] but i shall know hereafter peter says
[2:02:27] unto him thou shalt never wash my feet
[2:02:30] jesus answered him if i waste thee not
[2:02:32] that has no part with me
[2:02:34] simon peter says unto him lord not my
[2:02:36] feet only but also my hands and my head
[2:02:40] jesus saith unto him he that is worse
[2:02:42] neither is not saved to wash his feet
[2:02:45] but his clean ever with and you're clean
[2:02:48] but not all
[2:02:49] for he knew who should betray him
[2:02:51] therefore said he you're not all clean
[2:02:53] so after he had washed their feet and
[2:02:56] had taken his garments and was set down
[2:02:57] again
[2:02:58] he said unto them know you what i have
[2:03:00] done to you
[2:03:01] you call me master and lord and you say
[2:03:04] well for so i
[2:03:05] am if i then your lord and master have
[2:03:08] washed your feet you also want to wash
[2:03:10] one another's feet
[2:03:12] for i've given you an example that you
[2:03:13] should do as i have done to you
[2:03:16] verily verily i say unto you that
[2:03:17] servant is not greater than his lord
[2:03:19] neither he that is sent greater than he
[2:03:21] that sent him

[2:03:26] if you do that if you know the correct
[2:03:29] way
