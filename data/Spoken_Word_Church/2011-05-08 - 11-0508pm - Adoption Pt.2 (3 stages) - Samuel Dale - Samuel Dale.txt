Dell if I could kind of give a quick little testimony before uh saying this afternoon but my boss had been looking for a house for a couple years and he and I over the last two years have come very close and talking about the Lord and um I heard that he was buying a house or I thought he had closed on it and everything was Final and then on Friday of last week he called me in his office at 10:30 and he said 11:00 I want you to pray he says cuz I believe you have a direct contact with God and we know that the bride does Amen but I'm giving all the honor and glory to God about this it's not about me it's what he can do for those who don't understand but there was a I didn't know what the problem was at the time and if you've had any dealings in real estate there's always an issue if there's an issue or surveying or landay there's always going to be a real hassle so I didn't know that was the problem but he told me to pray at 11:00 so I called Howen Audrey and Janet real quick and I said I don't know what's going on but I want everybody to pray at 11: and that's the last I'd heard until 2:30 to say uh in that afternoon I got a text from him saying that he said you surely have contact with God he said there was a woman that they they began making calls real estate people began making calls of people around the area and asked if they had the same issue with the problem with the land with the creek beside the property and this woman said this must be of God this is what she said said this must be from God said I'm never at home I just come home to walk my dog and I am a real estate uh attorney and she said I can handle what is wrong with this deal and she took care of it so I just give God all the glory that amen he can work but you know even greater is it even

better in the Lord amen so remember these and keep them in your mind Ephesians 1 and 1 Peter 2 father we thank you for this day we thank you for the hour that we have upon the Earth but most of all we thank you for the fact that you have revealed yourself unto us and that Lord that you've come among us to make yourself manifest and Lord as we were trying to say this morning we just don't want to we don't want to miss Lord what you're doing and trying to look for something to come we want to be prepared against the day and realize realization and walk in the light of the love we thank you Father for everything and guide us now forgive our sins cleanse us and keep us Lord as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts God we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen Ephesians 1 verse three blessed be the god God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he have chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved right let's go over to to uh 1 Peter 2 1 Peter 2 and we'll begin verse one wherefore laying aside all malice and all gu and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speakings as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that we may that ye may grow thereby if so that ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious I to whom coming as unto a living Stone this allowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious ye also as Lively stones are build up a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ you may be seated the Lord at is blessing to the reading of the word now I'm trying to you know get us to an understanding and and all on what the hour that we're living cuz that's the main thing to me is a present tense gospel you know and to do that see sometimes we have to look over the uh life and existence and things like that and look and see what God says and and believe it and and keep on walking in in that point now I was trying to make a definite point this morning about uh you know and I said we'd be in adoption and we just put the title I told Brother Joseph just put it adoption in three stages and we'll go with that part 1 2 3 4 until we finish what we're wanting to cover and all and you know everybody wants to go on over to the adoptions and things and you know the the great manifestations and stuff like that but I want us to be just as simple as we can try to continue you know go through and see this the the stages of adoption and covering it like we did on the life of our will on the life of Jesus Christ to where that he was identified there see you know this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell all right he was identified he he was put forth to the world to be shown by as I said this morning his his baptismal service because it was necessary that he'd be baptized to wash the sacrifice and everything would be ready you know and all like that because he would would do that and then in his life we have the example see to where we can follow it and and we see that we start our journey of a Christian Journey as our water baptism too right you know we we start out as as that and and it's necessary that we uh be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and that way it would bring the promises of God to us to where that we can you know see those things and I I I want you to see that but I want you to think about the and keep it as simple as possible and and now this afternoon we're not going to deal with nothing but just trying to see how that we become the children of God right you say well we understand this we understand that well a lot of people don't and maybe sometimes we think we do and maybe we don't understand what we need to know about these things and trying to to make it as simple as possible to to deal with that the because you know as I said the Lord Jesus he didn't need a new birth right so he didn't go through those things to to do but God still came down and United himself with him there on the River Jordan as we talk about you know the his baptismal part and I do believe in that I believe that that was when that you know the spirit of God descended the Holy Spirit descended Upon Jesus Christ and is it then it was proclaiming him to be who he was and and that would be bringing him to the to the point that he needed to be all right because he needed to be recognized right you know and and it was done before the world well I believe that that you know ever born again believer that you know has the New Birth that and that is the you know to be born again is to have the new birth I believe that identifies Us in the the body of Christ amen all right that's what I want you to see and just kind of just hold it on that point and then we'll pick up more going along you know of our our stages of our journey but just think about your life and and the things that you do you remember how I've always told you that the way that I check a Doctrine how is it that I check a Doctrine by my new birth well I check it by the word well blent I've heard a lot of people say that I just tell it like it is if it don't if what a man is preaching doesn't compare with what God has done in my life right in my new birth right then I I just can't believe it I'm sorry I've told people that I'd say well I'm sorry I just can't see what you're talking about because it's not a not a point of argument it's just if I don't see it I'm not going to tell you yeah I see it you know that's well a lot of people you know they'll be standing around and somebody say do you see that yeah I think I see it you know looking up at something you know like that but they're just faking it they're not really seeing it I want to see it for myself amen you know in that way that I know that I've got it I don't have to worry about it see I like to to to see something personal that's right but see to me the new birth then the the coming into the body of Christ the as I said about the children of isra and gave you the the Webster's definition of adoption or adopt see where did everybody be specific adoption is the act or fact of being adopted I mean it's okay Webster but the adopt is to actually you take someone else's child born to someone else and you bring them into your family right and and you adopt them into your family with all legal rights and see than than it is in the bases of no more than it is in any other child because that's the law of the land that you you give that right by the adopt if you adopt somebody's children well then we're talking about Israel see you say well they were the chosen of God but how were they chosen they were a nation a people but they were adopted into the family of God see the process of of bring them forth and made it as I said the choosing is a word for adopt or even the word a spouse right see is the same word as adopt and in doing that then God chose Israel to be his people all right and when he chose them see he didn't give them the new birth back there that was the natural story of bringing in a people to a spiritual condition you know of being the ch chosen of God but they had to be chosen right something took place God adopted Israel into his lineage or line because they were you know it was there but we Gentiles as we read this morning from Ephesians there we were aliens from God we had no nothing because adoption pertains to Israel see because that would be their right their inheritance and we don't have any inheritance leave that way we don't have anything promised to us Gentiles we were just a bunch of dogs just Outcast just garbage you know wouldn't but see then when it came down to the basis that as I said Jesus started his he was identified right all right then he went to amount of transfiguration you know and authority and things and all came in then the change came well we're going to go through that way right right but want you to stay on with me on the basis of of just seeing how did we ever become the children of God right of course now the great message of the hour of people you know oh I always was a Son of God and they'll quote brother Randon well that's fine but keep quoting right see as a believer in the in doing I said this morning I'm a firm believer that we must be born again amen I don't believe we just come in this message you know you just just come along and you believe say I believe the message well the devil did too that make him born again you know all right but see that's you know I I want us to see that we must receive or come to a place because then adoption goes on it doesn't stop just by your new birth that's just the beginning see then it will go on to sunship but you know a child had to be a child you know you had to be first born into the the world or you're not here now that's just you know amen see it's a a child and and we read a lot of the quotes that we you know we didn't become children yeah here that no well all right that's in God's mind right right right but see there has to be a time that you and I must receive the new birth amen amen because if we don't receive the new birth we're not the children of God right we were aliens from God you know we were we were Outcast and and Peter we read said what did is it we come to the basis see to to desire that as newborn babies amen you didn't come into this message you know at full grown that's right you didn't come in to the New Birth that doesn't make you full grown it makes you a baby and we read over there and have used it in in Ephesians that we're we have the earnest of our inheritance that's right until the the Redemption of the purchased possession or or in other words everybody down through there as I said this morning had the new birth you know all born again Believers the new birth they were predestinated to that all right but you and I are predestinated to come to a finished fact or completion of this in our day and understand what's going on well all right let's let's do that and let's believe it amen and not just say well nobody Ain got nothing we just you know everybody just we we've around here we we've been saying the same thing for 40 years well that's a reason why right I have it written in my notes but I won't get to it this evening there's a reason why we've been around here 40 years you know what it is is to let all of the ones that wanted to denominate let them go ahead and denominate all right and that's just that's just as simple as can be there's other factors but that's just one point of what I'm talking about but see get the point first Jesus was the son of of God Amen he was born the Son of God he didn't become the Son of God he didn't become God on the River Jordan he was anointed to go forth with his ministry and all right and that was when God identified him as being his son amen right see then that was a a wonderful position because he said in other words I've come down now right that was what God was saying it it as we call it River Jordan experiencing things is baptism I've come down I'm showing you that I've come down I'm going to identify this amen if you get anything you know it's going to come from this one here right all right see then we look at that as adoption to be way on lat later you know over no he was God that's amen see and in his life as I said this morning you you've got the bible to read there's a lot of time time between when he was baptized and the point of where he come to mount of transfiguration that wasn't just sitting back well one he days I come Transfiguration I'll really have something then you know I I I'll become manifested you got to grow up we've got to cover that see he grew in Grace and knowledge the Bible said right but he was God the whole time all right now I believe your new birth brings God into you to make you a child of God right all right and that sets the stage then of adoption to where that eventually we can come to the position of authorities and things like that all right but yet we've got to have the the the the the baby's got to be born you know and that's what I want to hold on today I don't want to even get into and even well there some of the quotes I gave you brother random would be covering you know he said now that's where Pentecost failed and and all this that other think they were born into the family that ended at all but I don't want your mind to even go on to that way of thinking I want your mind on the thinking of the fact that the new birth makes us a child of God Amen all right now that's where he chose us we've read it there in Ephesians that we were chosen in him he chose us he chose to give us the new birth amen right all right in that way then I want us to just think about what he's given us right is I trying to hold it this morning to just the water baptism that identified you to the world that you was a Believer different from others that's right because you took on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ right not to just be baptized and just say well no I went down this way you know up and no it's to be sincere about it and realize realization of what we are and what's taking place right amen and realize this afternoon the one thing I want you to see is the importance of the baptism of the Holy Ghost AM because that's what gives you the new birth amen it's not to believe the message it's not to do all of those are are things that goes with it it's whether or not you're born again that's right amen see that's the point I want to hold in your mind is is do you realize and do you know that you are born again amen that's right see because you can't start the adoption without that part being brought into you there's no need to even talking about it yeah but I want to know these great M I want to the the Mysteries is that the there is a mystery of the new birth right see that is the mystery that God would come down and you ask me how it's done I don't know right that how God would come down and get into my soul and be able to give me a new birth when that thing is black and S as can be and gone into the world and and belonging to the devil right cuz you and I whether we like it or not we're K we was kin folks to the devil right amen we served him amen he was our Master right well know I was a good person all the time yeah you was a good devil that's cuz the devil's good he's not out there in The Honky talks he's not out in the slums you know the the things of the of the garbage can of the drinking and the doing he's not out there right the devil don't want to he wants to be in church he wants to hear about God and talk about him you know because he goes to church more than anybody does I wish y was over here like he is bless at least and and two he lets his presence be known that he's here oh my we can stop there and preaching while he lets his presence be known you know it ain't just he just sits around sleeping and slaming and slumbering and you know just well I'm here you know brother Dale wake me up when everything's going good no but listen see we were born kin folks to the devil that's right absolutely amen I know people don't believe that but I can't help it I believe it and I want you to believe it amen the only difference between me and you and anybody else in the world is one thing God chose us you said well he's over here he chose him for that purpose this group over here he chose him for that purpose that's right but he chose to give us his new birth he chose us to be in the body of Christ he adopted then see that's right so you get your mind all up into adoption and run into state but just remember he he had to bring us into the family the new birth brings us into the family that's why Jesus told Nicodemus said you must be born again right see you got to be born again to be able to see or to enter the kingdom and doing that that new birth then the prophet said is the most important thing in your life right that's right it's the new birth amen all right see then we need to to get that settled right man you know get that finished settled y That's to be where that we can can say we are the children of God and that's like I said I don't know why he chose you and I that's right do you know why God chose you oh I was so wonderful I was so gracious I was no no no no now if you want to stay a while and we preach a while according to the to the prophet in his message and the Bible that the last group coming in was to go out in the highways and hedges and compel them to come in right that's right go out and get the garbage canins right I mean is that the prophet's message is that the Bible well then we shouldn't think of ourselves as being too highly as the scripture says we were to think of ourselves if there's anything good about me it's what God has made me right he chose me I didn't choose him he chose me to be his child he offered me the part all I done was accepted it sure he knew I would do that that's predestination right we know but still he offered it but he offered it to everybody right as the prophet of God I like his way of saying it you know there's not a person in the world and in one way or the other that God hasn't dealt with whether it be your your contact according to your your uh tribe you was living in or whatever you was doing you know right he's contacted people that's right he's G us a choice am and by giving us a choice then all I done is accepted what he's done that's right that that's so hard to believe isn't it I mean if if you told people if you said okay now what I want you to do I want you to make a I want you to pay $10,000 to get salvation well they probably hardly not a person in the world that wouldn't start at least a down pavment on it right but see everybody offers you something like that and you want to try to do it or you go do certain penances you do certain ways or you do certain thought you know you believe certain Creeds you do but it's so simple right amen to just believe that's right that Jesus Christ died in my place that's right that's too simple ain't it it's so simple until it's hard to believe right it's easy to believe a lie yes you know you got the devil to help you that's right but it's hard to believe the truth the truth is that you and I must be born again amen and then by being born again that made us babes you know babies it didn't make us adults that's what it troubled at spiritually speaking see right is you see people that are sitting and have you ever seen somebody that I remember we was in school we had a couple of boys and we was in the fifth grade and and they was ready to you know they was about 17 16 17 years old and they they were wanting an excuse to quit school and I told you about it they got in a fight with a teacher where she You' finally expel them well my Lord if both of them probably shaving by then but they knew everything you know man they've grown up but what are you doing in the first grade if you grown up you know I mean that's that's just the way life is right we want to think we're grown up a kid you get about 12 13 years old man you think Mom and Daddy don't know a thing in the world I mean you think the whole world is messed up but you just you got it all in your brain you're so smart well don't worry about it if you live long enough you'll find out that wasn't right you know you'll find out Mom and Daddy was pretty smart well the thing I'm trying to get us to do just realize they hard to start with and save you a lot of trouble but that's human nature all right but do you see what I'm talking about yes I just want us to think about do you have the new birth all right now if you have the new birth then your adoption has already started right because that new birth brings you into the body that makes you a child of God Amen so the process is already into being right amen and the process of what I'm talking about is the thing that even down through Ages was all if you're listening this morning and been listening the everybody's predestined ated to the new birth and they had the new birth in every age all the way down all right but yet compare what they had with what we have we've come a long ways that's right but it's been God to bring us all of that way that's right all right and see then that new birth that new birth is what we need amen because that makes us a child of God then you can start the stages of adoption then you can start the growth of the development of a child but get the baby here first see but what we want to do is like brother Mo told a man one time he said you know he said what according to your Doctrine said in that time I think was Forest had just been born but anyhow he said what you're saying brother is that said my wife and she was at the hospital in I think with forest and he said what you're saying is it said my wife is just had a baby and said uh where's the baby oh they gone to get him a shaving haircut yeah right I mean cuz it's it's just born grown all of us would want to think that don't we that we're just grown up oh look you know look how we are no right we're just a bunch of babies right and babies are the ones that desire the sincere milk of the word all right now I want you to do this for for me if you will in this series of what we're talking about I wish you would read First Corinthians and 2 Corinthians okay I mean that's your your your uh assignment okay and listen to everything you can hear on the hear you hymns the adoptions the position in Christ and and the things like that listen to them over and over and hear what your Prophet is saying all right but the reason I say first and 2 Corinthians because really the Corinthians that's why it's that way it is the Corinthians it is the book of Corrections right all right in other words you see perfectly in the Corinthians a bunch of babies right see AR they were arguing about who's the greatest they were arguing about who was to be the leader you know they were arguing over the gifts to be right all of it was just an argument backward for and Paul constantly trying his best to get the Corinthians to grow up right right see and and to become the children of God but he never had any trouble with Ephesians he didn't have to explain the thing right to the church at Ephesus you know the Ephesians he didn't have to do that at Galatians he could tell them deeper things but to the Corinthians were always arguing about you know who do you follow I'm of apoll I'm a Peter I'm a I'm of in the message right uh but see it just always somebody trying to have some kind of a way right but what I want you to think on with me as I was ring out there at the end this morning see that we're aliens we were aliens away from God come on we had to be born again amen and by being born again that would put us in into the body that's right that would put us like then all of the stories the prophet would be telling you that you'll hear him explaining that in the Old Testament they had a custom of adoption all right and that custom of adoption was that that a baby was born into the family and when it was born into the family now there's a lot of the quotes here for the people on the internet and they can read it but you already to know the message if you heard anything at all you already to know that that child was born into the family right it was a child that's right see the father didn't disown the child because of the development of the child not being as great as the other right I mean there not a story there that the prophet tells and say well you know the the daddy couldn't trust the child so he cast him out of his family now there's no such thing you find your prodical son as an example that he wanted his right he took it he went out into the world he squandered all of it but when he come home what did daddy do well bless God Son you going to sit down over there you're not in my family just get on go on you wanted to leave you know no he brought him right back into the family cuz he knew he had learned a lesson he had grown up in that period of time that's right right and he got to the position that he could adopt you and we happen to be in Israel when they do it is somewhere around 13 years of age it's not always probably the same but we were there and we saw them having that big old word bar vitv ever how you pronounce it you know that where they adopt into the family right but that child was a child right it was born a child y it was adopted into its own family in that uh story our point is not adopting someone else right you know the children of someone else right is adopting your own children into your family or bringing them into a position all right we'll get to that as we go along but my point is they first you've got to find out how you became a child of God right right all right according to the Bible see you must receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost to become a child of God right according to the prophet's message we we you know we've got to receive Jesus Christ and that would make us a child of God all right but you know what's so wonderful about it it made me a child right God is not going to throw me away amen no more than as I said the father just because the child never reached to the uh adoption stages of its life they was still a child you know it it didn't set it to the brown table while the family set it to White table you know I mean it didn't have none of those differences in it it was a child right and it was treated as a child it just never was brought to that position to have that ceremony to be taken out and recognized or or brought before the public you know all right but it was a child and and if if we never reach anything in in the Statue of a perfect man or adoptions or whatever we talk about God's not going to throw you away that's what I think people are thinking about see that that why we around here 40 years later look like God ain't doing nothing as I said this morning I wish to heaven we would get that out of our mind amen and get to the basis that if you brought Peter them over here and put them here in this situation they would scream and holler bloody murder get me back where I was cuz I I man I can't stand this situation you said oh no well the same spirit that done one is done the other so I I hope you followed me right but you see we're in a different hour and time that's ever been upon this Earth there has never been and even back there somewhere into the 60s where those 200,000,000 demons was loosed that already had existed all form of demons and ways and persecutions and trials and and troubles and killings and and and then we get 200,000,000 loose on us right but us said on the bride right all right well you know what they're there for boy I tell you what I wish we get rid of them they're the very thing that you need that's right right amen right you need to devil that's right to stay after you yeah but looks like he let up every once in a while no the closer you get to God the more he's going to Bear Down amen I have never taught you a flowy bed of ease I have never taught you anything I have never said we're going to get better and we're going to get better everything oh the economy is going to straighten out Oh's going to straighten it up up there you know and no I don't care who who oh is he ain't going straighten this thing out I don't care if you put him and McCain both in office they couldn't straighten it out I don't throw off on nobody I thank God for where we're at and we're doing he's doing as good as anybody probably doing a day and hour we're doing let me put in a plug that away because there's one thing about it your belly is still as big as it was when he made the office probably even bigger and your bank account's probably greater to a lot of people you know that's right all right but that's I'm just being honest see that's not going to be that's not the point the point is the devil brother R said we need him to beat on us how does babies grow up y by learning it took me 16 years old before I learn to ride a bicycle you know why go we didn't have one I figured that get you we couldn't afford them you had them you know but see some of us are just playing slow and I guess that's what I've been all my life but as a child of God see we've got to grow up amen all right growth development is one thing but I want to ask you a simple serious question this is the the next message on down the road how do you grow right right man you know what makes a tree grow wind blowing it rocking it backs and for shaking it and beating it bending it over persecutions is what we need we're not talking about tribulation we're talking about persecution that the devil will bring upon you if you confess you're a child of God why he wants to try to break you right you said you was a child of God he wants to break you prove it right he did that with the Lord Jesus where is it with the Lord Jesus he went through a flowery bed of e once he was identified then the devil went right after him why took him 40 days and 40 nights out into the Wilderness he went with no water and no food you can't do that proved he was God if people don't believe that was God didn't that right there be enough cuz you can't live that long without food and water but he was almighty God but now listen we were born wrong so we need a new birth to make us the children of God right and then that brings us into the family now then it comes to word that God doesn't adopt anybody else's children that's right the stages of adoption won't apply to the world that's right it only applies to those that are the children of God Amen that's right and here we are coming down through and see thinking that we you know that we this that the other when we're trying to turn down the things that God has provided to bring us to the right place I know it's don't sound right I know that's not sounding right to the human mind right but how did Israel get back into the own land right by the Jews 6 million people being killed all over the country you know what that's what put them back in the promised land but now if you ask a Jew and he was really a true person what would he say I caused this because I wouldn't do what I was supposed to do if they're real true person huh see you and I are the one that brings these things upon us then we grip because they happen but it's part of our life right see the point of wanting you to get though get that's over there see you want to go on the point is get the new birth right well I've had a new birth for 40 years well then you ain't got no problem with me talking about it cuz you know I'm right right you know what I'm saying is right if you've got the new birth now if you're arguing about it in your mind then you don't have it is that enough yes yeah but we need this we need that how do you get it how you going to get it let's start off right amen right let's get the new birth let's get in the body that's right then we can expect a growth development that's right if we're in the body right because see we must be born again right and that's why I gave you a bunch of quotes and and I tried to isolate them but it's so hard to do with the way the prophet says it we must be born to be a son right right if we're a Son of God it means we're born again right we're not talking about the natural creation of the whole world as as being the the children of God that way the sons of God I explained that this morning we're talking about the body of Jesus Christ amen right we're talking about being in the body yes right by the new birth making us a child of God and and being a child of God then it means you're an offspring of God right you don't have to wait till the change come to become a child of God Amen that's where we miss the whole thing oh one of these days boy I tell you what that prophet he had it one of these days we'll have it well that one of these days is out in front of you come on you like the donkey with the carrot you know what I'm saying right you know what they done with a donkey you know he wouldn't get up and go so they put a carrot on the stick stuck it out in front of him you know he's trying to get the carrot and he pulls a the the card along we're trying to make something manifested when we're the best thing to do is just get born again now how did you get here naturally right how did you get here naturally right Mom and Daddy that's right you know Mom and Daddy brought a little baby in the world the thing about this we've been around here long enough to I'm just just about remember when a lot of you were born and I happened to be there in the hospital when a lot of them was born you know and everything I I've been with you I've seen you when you a little baby right if it let me I just been want it went in there way you you know kind of spank you a little bit but you know get you start life well that's all I've been trying to do ever since then you know it just spank us enough to get us to think about it consider that new birth that you have am God has partnershi you with eternal life amen that's right what a wonderful situation am as I said if I never reach any position I'm not going to die and go to hell right right if I'm a if I'm a if I'm a not a reverent child I'm not going to be Cast Away if I'm not a good child that you know mind and I'm not going to be Cast Away right to me that's a wonderful thing Amen to think that God gave me eternal life amen he know me a thing I owe him I owe him everything in the world he don't owe me nothing and it's not something good I done that's right I mean how many of you people got here by being how many of you people got naturally born by being good that's kind of a problem is it I mean sister Johnny did you was you something that you way back you know no no Mom and Dad just brought you here you said that's carnal but there's one thing about it's getting the point across right we didn't have anything to do with getting here naturally what did we have to do with getting here spiritually outside of one thing and that was accepting what Jesus Christ has done it can't be anything else can bring it because it salvation would be something Happ that's right so then we must be born again that would make us a child of God now once you get to that stage see of d That's What I Call stage one all right and stage one is to to come into the family by the new birth then we can call talk about the growth developments the the things that will transpire you know and that's why I tried to isolate if you'll look at your quotes and then remember when we get back to them later on the other ones you'll see brother random spends a lot of emphasis upon the basis of where we're failing at right but I'm not trying to get that point to you I'm trying to get to the point that there is no failure in the new birth that's it's the new birth right it's the most wonderful thing that could ever be cuz it made us a child of God like I said though people in the message see they're saying what always was a child of God see well then you don't need the new birth and Jesus Christ died in vain so you don't need that but what we need is to realize what the New Birth has made us you realize that one day you was a child of the devil come on K folks to the devil come on had one closer Ken and we served him right but then God in a split second made you a child of his right right gave us eternal life right right and then us stand as humans and say nothing ain't going on you know what I'm saying see people that's just the way they are we just going to church and being good now they just have Services every once in a while that's right you know I mean they just people at the churches they're just cutting down on the amount of services they have why because they gone out into the world with the rest of it you know and do it right was out west out there and they had a church that they said well we don't have evening services and I'm not calling names and they no state but they said we're not having evening Services because we all go hunting in the evening well in the summertime you went to church but in the winter time I reckon you went hunting you know I didn't understand that I wanted to ride with a man he said well let no need us going I don't have one service it was 3 or 4 Hour driver more I was going to ride with him go there and be in church that Sunday you know CU you know I certainly wouldn't go and Hunt but my point listen the new birth brings you into your family just as your natural birth brought you into your natural family right that's right your natural birth made you in the lineage y of your Earthly parents Y and made you air of all they have right your natural birth right all right now we could go out and adopt somebody else's children and that brings it into the same stages but see just use it like a saying the new birth then puts us into the family of God I know brother Gary he and I used to talk a lot about this that when you first born again you know Daddy just answers every prayer you make don't you remember that you remember when you first got saved you know how that Daddy was just there you could ask him for anything he' just give it to you why cuz he's a pet and a little old baby you know it matter if you said to you years old he his baby and he's giving you everything but then he realized hey you know I mean you give a kid everything it'll wind up sitting there with his mouth all it be eating right right no you don't want it to stay that way you want it to learn Amen to grow right you want it to muscles to be used that's what God wants in his family that's right but the main thing is are we in his family Amen brother I believe the message don't go that way that's right the devil's got you in the biggest trap that's ever been is to try to tell the people that they don't need nothing that's why I holler so much against it because see the people are preaching that you don't need all these things well then how in the world are the children going to be able to receive anything children you realize one thing that brother Dale he loves you and he done everything he could to help you right that's right right but he's also going to tell you you're lost right and you must be born again that's right you got to be saved you don't go to heaven because mom and daddy is going to heaven that's right amen you got to be born again it's not that you just well I was born in this family no right no you got to be born again if you're the age of accountability to understand what I'm talking about then you're at the age of understanding that you must be born again amen right to come into the family of God Amen but see when God brought you and I into the family now here's my whole thing I'm trying to get to you he adopted us into the family right adopted us into the family cuz that's where he chose us see I know that that doesn't agree with everybody else's adoptions they want the adoption of the statute perfect man the growth developments they want all that quotes but you don't listen to The Prophet talking that you must be born again right that you must be you must accept Jesus Christ to be in the family of God right and if you don't accept Jesus Christ then you're not in the family that's right we got to be brought into the family before we can start talking about growth of development that's right you but see that child as I said then that child as I said about the book of Corinthians he needs correction why because you want him to grow up right all right that's growth development that's that those those things but first to be in the family of God you must be born again to make you a child of God and then by being born again see then you become an air right now here's the adoption the prophet explains and he says that a child and the scripture says that there there have no inheritance what's he saying what is brother rown saying when he says the child is no different what is Paul saying in Galatians for that is no different we'll get to that scripture in a minute what's he saying is he saying that's not a child no no sir right you're going wrong now it's a child and it has a right to sit at the table and eat right it has a right of all the benefits of the family right it just can't be trusted with the inheritance the Rich Young Ruler done that right right I mean the the prodical son not the Richi Young Ruler the prodical son he took his ahead of time y had he had had he been raised right he wouldn't went out and blowed it right so then he wouldn't have been my child adopted into my family on the bases of inheritance so when you read the prophet and you hear him say see said he's a child said he has no inheritance what's he talking about he's not talking about that you can't sit at the table and eat right that's right right I'm just making the natural point he's not saying that you you're not in the family he's not saying the child is not a child that it's a disowned child and cast out of the family no right God has never done nobody that way right he's saying they're in there they're there they're children right but yet the growth development is not there that's right right right right he's covering growth development not whether or not you're a child right the new bird make you're a child of God you're born into the family of God just as you're born into your natural family that's right and by the new birth that puts you in the family right but yet that's not the point that you want a child to be right you look at your children you see pictures of them when they're 2 or 3 years old and you really the old man look at that you know but you don't want him to stay that that's right right that's right why because that's that's not the the the whole story right you know there's something wrong if the child stays that way that's right all right but see I gave you a whole bunch of quotes where brother talking about how you must be born the Son of God and see that's why you got to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost what is it first Corinthians about 17 you know where it talks about a a new creature that it makes you a new creature in Christ Jesus the new birth see a new creation why because that's what you are you become a child of God by the new birth now you have the right of adoption now are you listening to what I'm saying adoption was pertaining to Israel had no pertaining to you and I yes the new birth adopted us into the family of God that's right placed us chose us put us in the family now I've got a right to The Inheritance right I've got a right to to want to move up and to come to the place that that God wants me to be right see I've been brought into the family the first thing says you got to be brought into the family cuz you're not into the family just because your natural birth right right you're in your natural family because of your natural birth you must have a spiritual birth to be brought into the family of God the new birth and then when you have the new birth see then that puts you into that family right see now what happens go to Galatians 4 we we'll pick up and just get a few things and we'll see what Paul had to say about it cuz once that baby brought into the body of Christ but it's a baby all people all people are babies when they're first born into the family of God amen amen now it starts off with full grown we know the whole story the disciples were tutored for 3 and 1/2 years and when the Holy Ghost fell it gave them what was known as a Fai the father but on Theus I mean on the the 3,000 outside at the next time they're babies right babies right read all of the things in the Bible about just babies growing up cuz that's what God wants us to be so listen to how Paul sums it up now I say that the air now he's just coming down explaining the there's neither Jew nor Greek there's neither the bond or free there nether male or female and all and he's talking about that that we're Abraham's seed now we know we're not Abraham's natural seed the new birth makes us Abraham spiritual seed right right it is not a Jew that's a Jew outwardly but a Jew that's a Jew inwardly all now I say that the heir as long as he is a child differ nothing from a servant right though he be Lord of all the baby you don't trust it with driving the car right you don't trust it with the doing but you let it learn that's right amen and let them do that's what they always get with me because you know they say I'm just a do to your granddaddy with the grandkids cuz I've sat and you know we'd be working at home and and it'd take me an hour to do what I could done in 5 minutes you know why I was letting the grand kids help me or the kids you know CU it's training them you know and let them pound nails there some in our living room floor there probably a Geer counter would really go off right in the middle cuz there's probably 100 Nails drove in one Circ from this big well I didn't go tear them all out and do everything I just covered it over another sler you know but let them train and you know they learn right in the garden the other day you know and I was trying to plant some stuff and and if if it's really good I love to do it and I'll just drop my seed and you know instead of taking the hole and cover them up I just walk and push the dirt like that each way you know and some of you older ones know what I mean and you just cover it up well it pack and you walking on it and it kind of packs that wet soil down just like the planter does on the regular planter why you stuff comes up so good all right but you know as I start doing that in little Abby you know four years old in a few days and you know she want to help me I want I want to plant some well I give her some seed I used to do it with a kids I used to do it with a grandkid I have corn growing in the middle of the road amen beans right out in the middle right where the okra is at beans is growing up why I let him put them H well then she saw me doing that covering up and Nanny and list and then just D laughing at her cuz why cuz here I was dropping the stuff and she was coming along behind kicking dirt she learning he well a lot of people you can tell go out there and a lot of kids is 10 years old or 15 go out there and cover up that see cover up what do you do how you cover it up well let them learn they call me patience of Job when it comes to that cuz I do I love to I love to let the kids say look this is the way you do it you know this is I want to train them you know where they can they learn to do something right that's part of the family but see they're they're they're under what verse two but it's under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father even so we when we were children listen were in bondage under the elements of the world that's right all right now he's explaining a two-fold thing right first off the natural when you're under the bondage of the elements you're a child working in life you don't all right secondly if we're a child we're still under bondage a child is under bondage it's dependent upon somebody to raise it right to help it see all right but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son made one made under to redeem them under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons all right now he he's no different he's an air but he's given a tutor and I gave you a bunch of quotes where brother brandham and just handpicked a few of them where he tells you what the tutor really is for a Christian right newborn baby in Christ receives a tutor what is that the holy spirit amen that's right yep brother R said he couldn't found no better right he give you the Holy Spirit to be your tutor your Governor your your director Your Leader well why wouldn't we want to follow in the footsteps now see everybody wants to get on over into the other but you know well the the tutor has to go before and explain to the father a lot of times that we're not living right that's the next message all right stay in this message you know where I'm at today and think about it God gave us a tutor you know a razor the Holy Spirit right what could be greater than to think about that my father thought so much about me now listen that he didn't give me an angel we know there's angels and we know what they're for they're The Heirs of Salvation I know that I preached on it we know what it is but get the story right here he didn't pick out an angel and send it down to gu me to be my tutor right the holy spirit is my tutor amen that's right come on now you study the message and see what I'm talking about you said well an angel you preach this a right I preach as angels and I believe in it they for the ARs of Salvation right and every Born Again believer has an angel right we believe that right but this is what I'm trying to get you to see something more personal an angel is an outside outward uh uh being assigned to help you right but the Holy Ghost is an inside teacher right the holy I want the tutor inside see that way I don't have to worry about it then it's not you trying to tell the child what to do and the child's off in a world not even listening to you right it's the inside teacher that's right the holy spirit is the tutor the new birth brings you the tutor that's right right puts that holy spirit inside of you puts God's Own nature God's own life inside of you right right to raise you amen that's wonderful amen I mean whether do you think about it like I do or not that's a wonderful thing cuz if you could choose the best you could get in the world to raise your children h yes but see we want somebody as we'll get to it later we want somebody to tell it the truth you know the tutor's going to tell the truth right we don't want somebody to uh take it back to the father and try to butter it up I ain't going to help you grow right but see your tutor I gave you some quotes where the Prophet said the holy spirit is your tutor that's a inside teacher not an angel to be out here to protect you and guide you which is wonderful but it's an inside teacher that's right an inside tutor that's what the new birth means amen that's right it's not now listen it's not you get the new birth and then he gives you a tutor that's right all right don't go that way when he gave you the new birth that is the tutor to raise you amen he made it an inside one it's not that we got to be wait so long and then we'll get the Holy Ghost no no repent everyone of be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen which is a promise unto you and unto your children it's a promise amen but it's not do you understand what I'm saying I know I'm just making natural points I'm wanting to it's not that you would an angel is wonderful but that's an outside person or whatever you want to call it being to help you but the Holy Ghost is not an outside one he's inside to raise that child now wouldn't it be something what if you when you're children were born what if you could just stand there and the life come in them and you could just some way take your nature this you getting it wouldn't it be something to where you your baby was going to be born and you could just stand right there and you could say now this is what I want and to make sure of what I want I'm just going to come down and go in that child right I'm going to give that child part of my life that'd be great would it you see we can't do it doesn't work out way but God can that's right amen the new birth he just comes right down places his own life right the tutor is not a secondary person that's right he's not somebody hired to do the job he's not going to get paid whether he's good or bad you know he's not going to get paid better if he's good you know or whatever no right and what do they say in school if you're giv a tutor if the the teachers really know the tutor you have they know that according to that tutor that they can tell who the tutor of that person is right because they'll know the nature of the person and the way they answer questions and way they do the work and thing they can tell you this so and so was the tutor of that person that student because they're seeing their nature intill into the natural part of it but see the holy spirit is the nature of almighty God amen right he didn't trust it with nobody else that's right he come himself to make sure we have the right nature that's right he come to live in us hallelujah then whose nature are we supposed to display right amen and oh come on we still have our own human parts about us right just because you're born again doesn't get rid of everything that's that's why you're baby that's right that's right that's why the growth development has to be there that's right I mean you you say but but my child wouldn't do that cuz they're born again M well why do we do it we're supposed to be born again that's true you know why cuz we're still that much human that's why brother Dale's always been that way I've never preached some kind of Deliverance that would just and just some rabbit in hat trick to BU you just one day you're as mean as the devil and the next day you're just a saint and you'll never do nothing wrong now I don't believe in that right I wish it was right but don't believe in it you know why I don't believe in it cuz I lived it I'm still living it you know that's why I understand it that's why I understand why people are like we are is because I'm still living right that don't make it right or wrong that don't justify nothing we were trying our best last night to Define what would be a lie or not a lie you know and I mean that's hard to do you say A Lie Is A Lie well brother brand it's not a lie unless you're trying to hurt somebody with it or some motive or objective you know of what you're doing well you're saying that the prophet said it's all right to lie he didn't say it was all right to lie he didn't say that right he just telling you what it was and we were just like someone give an illustration like Aaron was like saying you know somebody would ask you something you know and you say well I've been sworn to not say nothing will you alive no my SAR of my oath to keep that a secret forbids me to run my big mouth see then you say well is it all right to lie no it's not all right to lie cuz you're trying to deceive with it right you know the difference that's right right right but it's not a lie unless it's really trying to hurt somebody but random said what that little boy said you was up on that mountain he said no I wasn't he said I wanted to see what they'd say this Prophet had the right answer we just have to search a lot of times we find it right then understand it right but now listen get the point real quick God gave us the tutor his own life now what kind of children are we supposed to be right when God thought so much of us he gave us his own life to bring us into his family so that he could start the process that would carry us into the authorities the adoption the change of the body that he started it off now get one more scripture go to Romans and we'll you'll see where we're going go to Romans 8 and then you'll see which way we're going you know I just forgot my notes might as well in Romans 8 if you read Romans 8 verse 14 through about 23 you'll find the three stages of adoption just like we've been talking about CU most of you have been around here long enough you heard me Teach over this in many many many many years but look at where it starts off verse 14 for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God if you have the new birth the tutor you're a child of God all right what does that make you for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear that's right but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry out our father then he goes on to explain the spirit beareth witness with our spirit all right see when you're born again you get the spirit of adoption the where you can start the process of adoption the holy spirit is the spirit of adoption right the tutor the razor is the same now listen with this will be valuable for about four Services down but the same holy spirit that is your tutor is the one that will position you in the body right sure right right why I said the tutor being in the Holy Spirit is very important because it's not that the tutor brings you up so far and then you turns you over to somebody else the tutor is the spirit of the father right and what is the adoption the spirit of the father doesn't change right it's the same holy spirit it's just according to what he's working on he has to come into you and I making us the children of God and we receive the spirit of adoption which is the holy spirit then the tutor becomes the razor the razor becomes the father right so you know what he's growing too he's enjoying this too oh yeah you know God is bringing out his manifestations right right it's going to bring his life into view just like it's going to bring ours the tutor the razor all right the holy spirit is your tutor but now listen to make sure you understand the tutor then doesn't adopt you it's the spirit of adoption that's right but the tutor becomes the Father the father's the one to adopt right I hope you kept what I'm saying there it won't be confusing to you see the holy spirit is your tutor but it also becomes your father am amen that way then it's all one as I said to start with this morning it's all three stages but it's is it really three stages or is it just a growth development you know you're the same child as you would Brother Anderson when your mama rocks you in the Cradle you just screwed up same child cuz he's our father let's stand here come on thank on these things but my point is what we must get the new birth to be able to say we are the children of God that's right or Nicodemus would have been told all you got to do is go back and confess what you got and believe what you had no he said you must be born again right you must die to yourself and receive my life was that what he was just saying if you receive my life then you're my child I know that's simple I know this morning was simple but I'm trying to get us to see that something is going on and has been going on for a long time not waiting to something to take place waiting on the finished product to reach the end sure W the body change but see your third stage of adoption now listen I'm making statements ahead your third stage of adoption is not the body change right that's not scriptural right it's too wit right to understand the Redemption of the body amen is your adoption that's right to come to an understanding that we've already been changed and we're still standing here as human Mortals there's your adoption there's the things that we have need of what do we got that's TR 167 in the red book we ain't done this long time when Pains of death SE my soul to the Lord I Cry till Jesus came and made me more I would not be I would not be become a child of God how could you and deny you oh I will not be and Ja in the days of my
