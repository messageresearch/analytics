[30:32] amen Hebrews
[30:34] 8 Brother Gary Atkins gave a testimony
[30:38] there a while ago about how that the his
[30:41] lag in his foot was doing a whole lot
[30:43] better so we thank God because the Lord
[30:46] he's with us to take care of everything
[30:49] and all if we we believe it so we thank
[30:52] him Hebrews 8:1 now the things which we
[30:57] we have spoken this is the son we have
[30:59] such an high priest who is set on the
[31:01] right hand of the Throne of the Majesty
[31:05] in the heavens all right remember that's
[31:08] Paul summing up after what he has said
[31:11] for seven chapters and he said now this
[31:13] is the sum we have such an high
[31:16] priest then Ecclesiastes 12 and: 13 when
[31:20] he's winding up what he's having to say
[31:22] about the Lord and the things he says
[31:25] let us hear the conclusion of the whole
[31:27] matter what is the conclusion of the
[31:30] whole matter now what to do fear God and
[31:33] keep his Commandments for this is the
[31:36] whole duty of man you may be seated the
[31:39] Lord at his Blessing to the reading of
[31:42] the
[31:42] word now we've been using
[31:46] a a lot of things to speak on and you
[31:50] know about the seven compound names of
[31:54] Jehovah and I pray that you would you
[31:57] know keep reading on these and and do
[32:00] your own study on them because that
[32:02] would be you know that's that's our
[32:05] desire is to get you encouraged to where
[32:08] that you will will uh you know uh study
[32:12] yourself and and search out these things
[32:14] and just take the the names and the
[32:17] things that we've been using and and we
[32:19] know
[32:20] that the in the Old Testament it was
[32:24] used as
[32:26] Jehovah being the uh Redemptive name of
[32:30] God because in Genesis 2 you'll find it
[32:34] says and the Lord God which is Jehovah
[32:38] Elohim so then they use that and come on
[32:41] through because Jehova means like a
[32:45] father with his family all right and
[32:48] that's the way that you know like in the
[32:50] Bible that that God was revealing
[32:53] himself and as I've said about these
[32:56] that we've used about the seven compound
[32:58] names of
[32:59] Jehovah that what it's doing is God
[33:04] revealing
[33:06] himself to individual
[33:09] persons you know and showing
[33:13] himself manifesting himself through
[33:16] those people all right now because
[33:18] that's the way God does it the way he he
[33:22] does things he uses people to do it and
[33:26] then he'll when he's using people to do
[33:28] it then he speaks to them of what he's
[33:32] wanting them to see him to be or to to
[33:37] understand him for the time so that way
[33:40] he doesn't speak to to everybody the
[33:44] same cuz he's personal to you and that's
[33:46] where you should believe it you should
[33:49] believe that he's trying his best to
[33:50] talk to you because you know that's
[33:53] God's way of doing things he speaks to
[33:55] mankind uh and and I I thank God for
[33:59] that but see then the seven compound
[34:02] names of
[34:04] Jehovah we gave you the paperwork and
[34:06] the things to look up on like Jehovah
[34:09] Gyra the Lord's provided sacrifice and
[34:11] then Jehova RFI the Lord is our healer
[34:15] well see then we went through you know
[34:17] like this morning Jehovah tishu which is
[34:20] the Lord our righteousness we see each
[34:23] one is showing things to the man that he
[34:27] was speaking about you know or the
[34:29] people or the situation and and that
[34:34] order that order to put it to our
[34:36] understanding or with the way that we
[34:39] look at it that he's revealing himself
[34:42] to us as all of
[34:44] these and it is in Jesus Christ amen
[34:48] because the if you believe in one true
[34:50] and living God then you'd have to
[34:52] believe that that great Jehovah that
[34:54] come down through the Old Testament
[34:56] dealing with the children of Israel and
[34:59] then one day came into human flesh and
[35:02] and you know his name is Jesus and if
[35:05] you run that name Jesus one of these
[35:06] days we will uh maybe when we finish up
[35:09] with this but you can take the name of
[35:12] Jesus and you just keep running it
[35:14] backward and you'll see that there was
[35:17] times that he appeared not as the person
[35:20] you know Jesus down through but the
[35:23] things that was made known to mankind
[35:27] was bringing that name into being and it
[35:30] goes all the way back uh to Jehovah
[35:34] savior so that's what we're trying to to
[35:37] bring forth all right now what has been
[35:41] our point about the seven compound
[35:44] names it's it's just to me it's like
[35:49] uh now to one person looking at it one
[35:53] thing May mean more than others as I
[35:56] said down through time as he was
[35:58] revealing himself but for doing it
[36:01] overall it turned out to be now I'm a
[36:07] father okay now my wife doesn't look at
[36:11] me as
[36:13] father because I'm not that I am her
[36:18] husband my mother wouldn't look at me as
[36:22] a husband she looked at me as her son
[36:26] right all right now I've got many titles
[36:30] like the head of grandfather great
[36:33] grandfather and all like that but who am
[36:36] I and what am I just one person that's
[36:39] but I manifested in many different
[36:43] ways to show myself see those are my
[36:48] attributes now God had in him
[36:51] attributes that he wanted to reveal
[36:54] himself he wanted to be a Healer right
[36:57] well there was
[36:58] nobody back there
[37:00] sick but when man was allowed to be
[37:04] placed in the garden and the fall came
[37:06] then we know immediately that we needed
[37:09] a savior we needed a Healer we needed a
[37:12] deliverer we needed all of the things
[37:15] that would be related to his name and
[37:18] those were his attributes being
[37:20] displayed just like my attributes it's
[37:24] taken me 70 years see to display the
[37:27] attributes that I have displayed but
[37:30] through that I have wound up having many
[37:32] many many attributes to that but it's
[37:35] the same
[37:36] person all right we're talking this
[37:39] morning I said the the key to
[37:42] understanding if we would even talk
[37:44] about Jehovah Gyra Jehovah Raa Jehovah
[37:46] tiu and and all like that would be to
[37:50] realized that it would all be connected
[37:52] back to
[37:53] Calvary all right because Calvary is
[37:56] were that God became Our
[37:59] Savior youd say well I was saved brother
[38:02] Dale before the world but if you don't
[38:05] come to it in this world then there's
[38:08] something wrong because what he saw is
[38:11] what we are here right all right so then
[38:15] that's what we need to deal with you
[38:16] know and see if you don't receive
[38:19] eternal life you don't have eternal life
[38:21] that's just as just as much as as
[38:23] anything we could talk about but now
[38:26] looking at it and seeing Jesus Christ as
[38:28] almighty
[38:30] God seeing that person that was made
[38:34] manifest among us to be as the scripture
[38:36] called him Emmanuel God With Us but in
[38:41] him was all of that
[38:43] Redemptive product because he was the
[38:46] one that paid the price right he was the
[38:49] one that died for us he was the one that
[38:52] raised he was the one that has come back
[38:54] to live in us on a lot see then he has
[38:58] to be the almighty God or else we're
[39:01] picking up more personalities identities
[39:03] and persons and we're going right back
[39:05] to the trinitarian concept you know that
[39:08] we used to have of Father Son and Holy
[39:10] Ghost Blessed Trinity but we don't
[39:13] believe that we believe in God having
[39:15] many manifestations but be the same God
[39:19] now in coming forth like that then we
[39:22] can look at these things that has been
[39:24] revealed to
[39:25] mankind and then see what he means to
[39:28] you and me now as Wade talked about
[39:31] Abraham one day I remember uh him
[39:33] bringing the message part and talking
[39:36] about Abraham and what God done for
[39:38] Abraham well that's
[39:40] wonderful but you know that won't do you
[39:42] a bit of good if you don't believe it if
[39:44] God doesn't speak to you what he done
[39:47] for Abraham won't do a bit of good we
[39:49] can say we believe God spoke to Moses we
[39:51] believe God spoke to all these people
[39:53] that's all well and
[39:55] good but but if he don't speak to you
[39:57] and me where are we well then we come up
[40:01] see with the concept that well God don't
[40:03] speak to people anymore now you show me
[40:06] that in the
[40:09] Bible I don't you know I'm just blunt
[40:12] tell me that in the Bible I want to see
[40:15] where it says that he don't speak no
[40:17] more because I can go through the Bible
[40:20] and find out that he's still
[40:22] speaking and even get into the Book of
[40:24] Revelations and find out he'll be
[40:26] speaking out we get out of here amen so
[40:29] then we shouldn't
[40:30] be we shouldn't let that ENT our mind
[40:34] all right but now as I say about this
[40:37] morning and been saying it over and
[40:40] over there are seven compound names of
[40:43] of Jehovah and they all apply to Jesus
[40:47] Christ but if we make one of them a
[40:50] large portion and the other one a
[40:52] smaller portion and up and down what
[40:55] have we done
[40:57] he would not be the same yesterday today
[40:59] and forever right now irregardless of
[41:03] what how many manifestations I have had
[41:06] in my
[41:07] life none of those can be any greater
[41:10] now so you could say well now now
[41:12] brother Dale your wife you're her
[41:14] husband that's that's all right that way
[41:17] but still that don't change
[41:19] me right I'm the same person I've just
[41:24] got many manifestations
[41:27] but now those manifestations are of the
[41:29] same equal
[41:31] value if we look at it
[41:34] correctly we seen that he is Jehovah
[41:36] Gyra which is what the Lord's provided
[41:40] sacrifice all right being Jehovah
[41:43] Gyra to take our
[41:46] place then he made a way to come and
[41:48] enter into us
[41:51] right by the new birth see all right
[41:54] that brings Jehovah gy
[41:57] into
[41:59] you because he becomes your savior all
[42:02] right then that would bring at the same
[42:05] basis that would bring Jehovah rapi
[42:08] which means the Lord that Health all of
[42:10] thy
[42:11] diseases he comes inside of us all right
[42:14] are you following
[42:15] me see I'm I'm holding that to that one
[42:18] person not a one that's concept
[42:21] now but to one person right with many
[42:25] many
[42:27] manifestations so then we covered in
[42:30] this
[42:32] morning that he is our our
[42:36] righteousness Jehovah tiing you he is
[42:40] our
[42:41] righteousness we see that is not a
[42:44] self-righteousness and it's not
[42:45] something we can do because the Bible
[42:48] said our righteousness is his filthy
[42:51] rags okay but it's what he's come inside
[42:54] of us to do in us now I'm trying to get
[42:59] the point to all of us okay me you all
[43:02] of us that these things that we're
[43:06] speaking of are in You by the New
[43:10] Birth the new birth brings him as
[43:13] Jehovah
[43:14] Gyra the Savior Jehovah rea the Healer
[43:18] put's the Healer inside of
[43:20] you we don't have to pray healing down
[43:24] from
[43:24] heaven I I'm I'm
[43:27] sorry I just blunt I got a little note
[43:31] my brother said to that he like to kind
[43:34] of the harshness way I spoke on the
[43:36] computer today and and all but I don't
[43:39] I'm not harsh I'm not mean I just say
[43:41] what I believe and and and that way you
[43:44] don't have to nobody don't have to wor
[43:45] what I believe there's a lot of people
[43:48] that I don't know what to believe and
[43:50] some of you I don't know what you
[43:52] believe you know why cuz you never told
[43:55] me
[43:57] well I can't look at you and read what
[43:58] you
[43:59] are you know I mean but you've never
[44:03] told me and some people kind of hide
[44:06] what they believe you preachers do that
[44:08] especially you watch them they get to
[44:10] playing around preaching and after a
[44:12] while you watch them they'll start
[44:13] turning to one side and they'll start
[44:15] turn and the people over here will be
[44:17] amening and they'll be locked in you
[44:19] know and the rest of them's gone they
[44:21] just right our cuz this group has found
[44:24] out what they're doing
[44:26] well a lot of people planted a lot of
[44:29] rotten seed by being deceptive but you
[44:32] can't accuse me of
[44:34] that now I've been here 40 years
[44:37] preaching and you can't accuse me of
[44:39] trying to trying to be
[44:41] deceiving I just tell you like it is
[44:44] right whether you like it or lump it
[44:47] that's just what I
[44:48] am that's why I say I believe in one
[44:51] true and living God I'm not a Oneness
[44:54] I'm not a trinitarian I believe in this
[44:57] correct scriptural understanding of one
[45:00] God well here this make you know it all
[45:02] well okay no I'm not a know it all but I
[45:06] know one that knows
[45:09] all now that is being that then he send
[45:13] some of it to me if that makes me that
[45:15] you just do what you want to with it but
[45:18] now
[45:19] listen having all of these things inside
[45:23] of
[45:24] you that's my point
[45:27] now all of these compound names will
[45:31] deal from the inside of you by the new
[45:35] birth
[45:37] right all right so now you're
[45:42] manifesting from the New Birth what you
[45:44] believe God to
[45:48] be I believe him to be all of these
[45:51] seven comound names that's what I'm
[45:53] trying to show you amen I believe he's
[45:56] my
[45:58] savior I believe he's my healer I
[46:01] believe he's my righteousness cuz I
[46:04] don't have any but if he says I'm
[46:07] righteous why can't I why can I not say
[46:10] what he says
[46:12] amen and let me confess
[46:15] it and just walk into it cuz you can't
[46:18] separate it all right they must all
[46:21] apply to Jesus
[46:23] Christ and cannot be valued one above
[46:26] the
[46:27] other right making all the same
[46:32] value the value that God
[46:34] is and see that'll keep us on the right
[46:36] level all right now I've been through
[46:39] that so many times I'm hoping that
[46:40] you'll you'll uh you know be with me on
[46:43] it but I want
[46:45] to pick up now and maybe try to get a
[46:47] couple of these today if we can so if
[46:50] you
[46:51] will turn with me to uh judges 6
[46:59] let's pick
[47:03] up and here's a key that I'm trying to
[47:06] get you to see okay you remember what I
[47:09] always say now if I say this is the key
[47:11] what are you supposed to do write it
[47:15] down write it down make a note he's
[47:18] fixing to say something that's going to
[47:20] be
[47:21] valuable well you see I believe that God
[47:25] is revealing to you and
[47:27] I who we
[47:29] are and what we're doing
[47:32] here and to see them then see him as our
[47:38] savior then see him as our
[47:42] healer and see him as our
[47:45] righteousness we can see that everything
[47:47] is in
[47:50] him but then he imparts that to you
[47:57] then Paul said what that it's Christ in
[48:02] you the hope of glory now so we want
[48:06] everything inside of us and each one
[48:10] will uh how would you call it unfold
[48:15] itself
[48:17] into a a deeper understanding is what
[48:20] I'm trying to do you know so if we can
[48:23] see that he's our savior
[48:26] he's our healer he's our righteousness
[48:29] will surely that order bring the next
[48:32] one that we're talking about which is
[48:34] Jehovah
[48:36] Shalom the Lord our
[48:40] peace and when you realize who you
[48:44] are you can have
[48:48] peace have you ever had
[48:52] this something going wrong you know some
[48:55] problem
[48:57] and all at once you
[49:00] realize that there are things taken care
[49:03] of you
[49:05] know it just brings a peace doesn't
[49:09] it and that peace passes all
[49:16] understanding I told you about the time
[49:18] I had that 30 off 6 to go off the barrel
[49:20] about that close to my head stand up
[49:22] against a tree and I literally couldn't
[49:25] Fe like had no
[49:27] feeling and a very very little hearing
[49:31] because about that time I heard an
[49:32] airplane go over and and I can hear him
[49:36] going you know and I had bark in my
[49:40] forehead and little pieces of
[49:43] lead but you know do most people that
[49:46] would have just went
[49:48] Highwire they said well what did you
[49:52] do I went on done what I stood I
[49:55] couldn't hear of course I HED around
[49:58] because I couldn't feel nothing I HED
[50:00] around and tried to see if all the parts
[50:01] was there you know I realized if it
[50:04] blowed off something my hand would go
[50:06] down in it and blood be everywhere I had
[50:08] enough common
[50:09] sense so when I began to rub all over
[50:11] and realized that everything was still
[50:13] in place and little bit of blood coming
[50:16] off my
[50:18] head I just climbed up tree and went
[50:20] home honey that
[50:24] day is quite a while for be
[50:29] here will you
[50:32] see
[50:34] well me I had jump down and run to the
[50:36] doctor what's he going to
[50:38] do I could figure out I was all still
[50:42] together for a minute I wondered if I
[50:44] was over there start with but because
[50:47] you know I didn't know where I done but
[50:50] went over what had happened because I
[50:52] was so
[50:54] numb but if you ever had something like
[50:56] that to happen and all at once then you
[50:59] just
[51:03] calm it's just you know
[51:06] just everything's at
[51:10] peace you'd like for it to be that way
[51:12] all the time would you I
[51:15] would I've been in situations where that
[51:18] when things would come out of it it
[51:19] would be so wonderful a
[51:22] piece all right that's what I'm trying
[51:24] to talk about
[51:26] because see he is our
[51:28] peace but now remember where this peace
[51:31] is
[51:32] at we're trying to find peace right is
[51:36] not that the whole world you know the
[51:39] government wants peace this wants peace
[51:41] that government wants peace that
[51:44] country we see through the
[51:50] Christian the peace is
[51:54] within that's where our trouble is we
[51:57] try to think if we can get to a certain
[52:00] place that we can find
[52:03] peace you know if we can go here we can
[52:07] go there we can find
[52:09] it but it's an inner peace right
[52:14] amen it's an inner piece not an outward
[52:19] one you know when I had the piece there
[52:22] when the gun went off you know it didn't
[52:24] stop all the world from just falling
[52:27] theart you know it went right
[52:32] own it didn't change nothing but me
[52:35] that's right that's
[52:37] right now you think about it so right
[52:39] let's go over here and
[52:44] judges now if you know the story I'll
[52:46] just give you the background before we
[52:47] read and then you'll have
[52:49] it the children of Israel had got into a
[52:52] position here where that the enemy would
[52:54] just come in and just even though they
[52:57] would raise their food and try to get
[52:59] everything
[53:01] ready the enemy would just come in and
[53:03] take it away from them because they were
[53:06] so vast and so you know strong until the
[53:10] children of Israel didn't have anybody
[53:11] to Rally up and and to try to fight
[53:14] against
[53:15] them and if it come to a to a situation
[53:18] and Gideon you've heard the story of him
[53:20] many times over and over and
[53:23] over he he was Thresh and wheat but what
[53:26] he was doing he was going to go hide
[53:29] it cuz what else you going to do when
[53:31] you know the enemy is coming I mean you
[53:33] know the enemy got enough sense to know
[53:35] weak time you
[53:37] know so they were trying to gather it
[53:40] maybe a little early you know get
[53:42] everything to going and they were going
[53:44] to he was going to go hide
[53:46] it
[53:48] well something
[53:51] happened amen it wasn't because of how
[53:55] how good Gideon
[53:58] was it had nothing to do with
[54:01] him and yet God comes on the scene and
[54:04] he
[54:05] says you know through the angel of the
[54:07] Lord and he
[54:09] says
[54:11] Gideon the great man of
[54:14] Valor you know a
[54:17] warrior
[54:21] courageous now that wouldn't have looked
[54:23] like it if we standing there watch in
[54:25] him right I mean a movie made of that
[54:27] what would it look
[54:29] like it looked like a bunch of stinking
[54:32] rotten scared
[54:33] cowards
[54:35] right because he's
[54:38] worried he was trying to save a little
[54:40] food for his
[54:43] family and he's scared to
[54:46] death but when God looked down he said
[54:49] great man of
[54:54] Valor
[54:56] because Gideon didn't have that within
[55:00] himself that's what I've tried to go
[55:02] over and over now the peace that comes
[55:04] is the inner peace the Healer the
[55:07] Savior our righteousness everything is
[55:10] within
[55:11] us revealed unto us of God to be able to
[55:15] let us not look what he says then when
[55:17] it gets down
[55:20] to verse
[55:23] 22 and when Gideon perceived that he was
[55:26] an angel of the Lord Gideon said alas oh
[55:29] Lord God for because I have seen an
[55:32] angel of the Lord face to face and the
[55:36] Lord said unto him peace be unto
[55:40] thee fear
[55:43] not Thou shalt not
[55:50] die
[55:52] now would that be something
[55:57] are you laying on a
[55:59] deathbed the doctors done pronounced you
[56:02] that the basis
[56:04] that there's no
[56:08] hopes and yet God says
[56:12] peace Brother Dy back
[56:16] there years ago he went
[56:19] fishing him and I think was him and his
[56:21] brother was down on a lake fishing
[56:26] and he had worn his uh boots and things
[56:30] that where he had uh was doing concrete
[56:33] work you know rubber boots up to your
[56:35] knee and
[56:37] another and something happens he falls
[56:39] out of the boat into the
[56:42] lake well see he could probably got out
[56:46] all right but yet is that water was
[56:49] beginning to fill up in his clothes and
[56:51] down into his
[56:52] boots they just wouldn't no
[56:58] way and
[57:00] yet he fell into the water
[57:03] and somewh he just was sticking his
[57:07] hands
[57:08] up he got deep enough into the water it
[57:10] was way over him you know and
[57:12] things his brother I best I remember the
[57:15] story now the boat F nearly over or
[57:19] something and pushed back towards the
[57:20] bank he can tell you the whole story
[57:23] well his brother had to get to the boat
[57:25] and get back over to where he
[57:27] was we see you know 30 seconds is bad
[57:31] enough if you're down in water but they
[57:34] don't know exactly really how long that
[57:36] it took but his brother gets back over
[57:38] to where he's at and he's trying to find
[57:41] him in the
[57:43] water and he is
[57:47] he I think brother darted it right you
[57:49] had the fishing pole right had a fishing
[57:52] pole in his hand so he was that deep
[57:54] down in the water the fishing pole
[57:56] wasn't up above the
[57:58] water it was that he was that deep down
[58:01] and he was Raising it
[58:03] up well how long it took we know that it
[58:06] took 2 or 3 minutes 5 minutes or maybe
[58:10] whatever but he was holding that fishing
[58:12] Bowl up and his brother got to the place
[58:15] where he realized where about where
[58:17] there was and he began to do in the
[58:19] water with his hand or something
[58:21] something happened I can't remember the
[58:22] whole story there but he caught the into
[58:25] that Rod well you know what Brother D
[58:26] was a hold the end of the
[58:29] rod and he just pulled him up out of the
[58:33] water we get to call that brother dy's
[58:36] been in the you know we jump in the car
[58:39] and drive
[58:40] down get down in the hospital and he's
[58:42] sitting under the bed talking to
[58:45] everybody you I mean if he's in that
[58:48] water one
[58:50] minute that's enough
[58:53] right but they don't realize you know
[58:55] don't know exactly how long but brother
[58:58] Dy said to best could remember me
[59:00] telling him telling me that he just
[59:03] stuck his hands up with that
[59:07] Rod
[59:10] well he wasn't fighting and struggling
[59:13] that was all
[59:16] over cuz he knew it was
[59:19] done but see he just settle down and his
[59:23] brother just pulled him out of the water
[59:27] see that's the time you want peace
[59:30] then that's the time you want somebody
[59:32] on your side amen cuz you ain't got time
[59:34] to pray that's
[59:37] right you just want somebody on your
[59:39] side right
[59:41] then but you
[59:44] see fear
[59:46] not Thou shalt not
[59:50] die what about having a peace when
[59:52] everything going wrong right
[59:55] but God's word says you shall not
[59:58] die now I'd rather have God's word than
[1:00:01] everybody in the country and all
[1:00:02] the
[1:00:05] right I'd rather have God's word but
[1:00:08] look what he says then in verse
[1:00:13] 24 and God's told him about his peace
[1:00:16] now fear not that shal not
[1:00:20] die then Gideon buil an altar unto the
[1:00:23] Lord and called it Jehovah
[1:00:26] Shalom unto this day it is yet in the
[1:00:30] ofer of the
[1:00:33] abits now Jehovah shalom means what the
[1:00:38] Lord our
[1:00:40] peace it look like it would
[1:00:44] be
[1:00:46] uh as I said he came to him under the
[1:00:49] point of what each one was to reveal uh
[1:00:52] look like it would have been Je hovah
[1:00:55] some kind of a great warrior or
[1:00:57] something
[1:00:59] no now he's facing and you go on and
[1:01:03] read you know and he kills a whole bunch
[1:01:05] of
[1:01:06] people of the enemy that comes after him
[1:01:09] and you know what he he makes it a good
[1:01:11] a job until they quit trying to come
[1:01:13] down and right the stuff you
[1:01:15] know you see God took
[1:01:18] over but God wanted him to have
[1:01:22] peace in other words for reason it said
[1:01:24] there you know Thou shalt not
[1:01:26] die because he was you know if he was
[1:01:30] going to
[1:01:31] fight somebody going to get
[1:01:34] hurt and back then they didn't play
[1:01:36] games like they do now they in other
[1:01:38] words they just sliit the man's throat
[1:01:40] and as it cuz that took care of your
[1:01:41] enemy you
[1:01:42] know
[1:01:44] and he said Peace be unto
[1:01:51] thee right in the midst of all of the TR
[1:01:55] trouble he's fixing to start fighting
[1:01:57] and God says
[1:02:00] peace
[1:02:03] okay
[1:02:05] peace ever spoke to you like that
[1:02:09] ever I said if you ever had something
[1:02:11] really bad going wrong and all at once
[1:02:13] you just realize that something else was
[1:02:16] there and everything was
[1:02:19] in in
[1:02:23] control
[1:02:27] peace now a man that's going to kill a
[1:02:30] bunch of
[1:02:33] people a man has got to fight a
[1:02:37] battle run off an enemy and God says
[1:02:41] peace well now brother D what that would
[1:02:43] mean was Gideon was going to was told
[1:02:46] peace so he goes over and sets down
[1:02:48] under a shade
[1:02:51] tree now that's not according to way I
[1:02:54] read it
[1:02:56] I think he got what was Ox
[1:02:59] go like a big old progen stick and he
[1:03:02] just started frailing the daylight out
[1:03:04] of everybody come along well you know
[1:03:07] when they got through I don't how many
[1:03:09] of them was there but he turned around
[1:03:11] and said okay boys and the rest of you
[1:03:12] w't need come
[1:03:13] on and he was fighting people with
[1:03:16] swords and Spears and Shields
[1:03:22] and when
[1:03:25] something can't you just see it I mean
[1:03:28] he's got a great big old we had a great
[1:03:29] big old something to hold up stick or
[1:03:31] something and he's got a stick and he's
[1:03:33] just going peace
[1:03:35] peace wonderful peace you know coming
[1:03:39] down from the
[1:03:42] father
[1:03:48] above wouldn't it be something to been
[1:03:50] his
[1:03:52] wife sit nowh looking at him said he's
[1:03:54] gone crazy it's a
[1:03:57] bat he's got a stick after the
[1:04:00] Army and he's Hing peace
[1:04:05] peace but you know that what take that
[1:04:08] was what was taking
[1:04:10] place so he buil an
[1:04:15] altar unto the
[1:04:17] Lord and he said
[1:04:19] Lord you brought me
[1:04:23] peace
[1:04:25] you brought me
[1:04:33] peace what
[1:04:35] about Ephesians
[1:04:40] 2:4 says he is our
[1:04:45] peace so always in the Bible it was kind
[1:04:48] of be a a point because if you'll notice
[1:04:52] when an angel of the Lord would come
[1:04:54] to someone or somebody speaking
[1:04:56] something or Jesus a lot of the accounts
[1:04:59] especially after the resurrection I was
[1:05:01] looking a bunch of them and after his
[1:05:03] resurrection you know he would come into
[1:05:05] appear among the people and naturally
[1:05:08] they were
[1:05:09] afraid you know one time it even
[1:05:12] listened they thought it was a spirit
[1:05:14] you
[1:05:15] know and what did he say
[1:05:19] peace peace be unto
[1:05:22] you I think that's the way really this
[1:05:24] terminology is when they say
[1:05:26] shalom and you're in Israel and you say
[1:05:28] shalom and they say shalom
[1:05:31] shalom I believe that's the correct way
[1:05:33] one I was told that anyway God it means
[1:05:35] peace but see then when you say to
[1:05:37] someone peace
[1:05:39] Shalom see then they speak back to you
[1:05:42] shalom shalom which means God's peace be
[1:05:45] unto
[1:05:47] you
[1:05:52] peace Jesus said said in John
[1:05:58] 14:27 my peace I give
[1:06:04] you you want to be
[1:06:09] worried well be all
[1:06:12] flustrated and
[1:06:16] everything you people that the brothers
[1:06:18] and all that was in the
[1:06:21] service what do they teach you
[1:06:27] that gets you to be calm
[1:06:30] not cuz you go off the head you lost the
[1:06:34] battle I don't care what you
[1:06:38] got you lose your head you lost the
[1:06:41] battle so stay
[1:06:44] calm trust what you've been taught to
[1:06:48] do you've been trying to handle these
[1:06:53] situations
[1:06:54] so now
[1:06:56] relax go at it just like it's
[1:07:03] training what
[1:07:07] peace we look around and we see the
[1:07:10] world today and the the economy and
[1:07:13] everything Georgia now over 10%
[1:07:21] unemployment things are tightening down
[1:07:26] let see God says
[1:07:29] peace amen what do you mean everything's
[1:07:32] going
[1:07:34] wrong
[1:07:39] peace just be
[1:07:41] calm God said he'd take care of
[1:07:44] us we'll get to that in a second he said
[1:07:47] he he promised
[1:07:49] it so just be at
[1:07:52] peace well Brother D you mean you don't
[1:07:55] get scared and
[1:07:56] excited you I'm a human
[1:07:59] being and all of us
[1:08:02] do but then in times when things that
[1:08:05] you
[1:08:09] realize and then you recognize God's on
[1:08:12] the scene but you know the biggest
[1:08:14] problem we have is that the battle's
[1:08:17] over the things are done the problems
[1:08:18] finished and and then we we realize
[1:08:21] God's there you know right
[1:08:24] when it's all finished then we think
[1:08:25] about God being there well why shouldn't
[1:08:28] we think about God being there the whole
[1:08:29] time
[1:08:34] right just
[1:08:36] peace you
[1:08:38] know just be calm
[1:08:41] and don't worry about
[1:08:43] it but see Gideon thought so much of
[1:08:46] that until he didn't right out there
[1:08:50] here's the place that Gideon whoop the
[1:08:52] army
[1:08:54] no didn't knew he didn't whip
[1:08:59] nobody but he realized God come on the
[1:09:10] scene what about
[1:09:12] Samson taking a Jawbone of a mule and
[1:09:15] killing a thousand
[1:09:22] Philistines cuz he knew where he was
[1:09:25] at right you're not going to have peace
[1:09:28] unless you know where you're
[1:09:30] at right
[1:09:33] right you remember the man that brother
[1:09:36] R tells about that that the little baby
[1:09:38] was dying and the blood pressure had
[1:09:41] already dropped so low that it had never
[1:09:42] been that low before and anybody come
[1:09:44] back and and the nurse was they was in
[1:09:46] there and brother around and prayed and
[1:09:48] and the man looked over at his wife and
[1:09:50] said honey look at it said the Lord has
[1:09:52] healed a baby

[1:09:59] understand nobody's ever went that low
[1:10:01] and it come back up and they
[1:10:04] lived he said honey you looking at your
[1:10:07] machines and that's

[1:10:17] my
[1:10:19] heart that the baby's going to
[1:10:21] live read the story and listen for 3
[1:10:25] days it got
[1:10:29] worse worse than what it
[1:10:33] was but you know
[1:10:35] what the child

[1:10:41] I got
[1:10:45] peace when the world's fighting you

[1:10:49] all the things that are going on around
[1:10:50] the
[1:10:52] world
[1:10:54] no you know I depend upon the
[1:10:58] scriptures that God has
[1:11:02] spoken and he said he never leave you
[1:11:05] nor forsake
[1:11:07] you said my peace I give unto
[1:11:11] you and said in a time of trouble don't
[1:11:14] worry about
[1:11:17] it because I'll be

[1:11:50] way and you don't need nothing El

[1:12:52] wrong and it shows the in and I said
[1:12:54] come on folks I'm a human
[1:12:56] being but when God is on the scene I
[1:12:59] don't worry about

[1:13:06] death I've been out the wind blowing the
[1:13:08] trees start moving you know human but
[1:13:11] but I stood one day and looked and I
[1:13:14] stood on my front porch which is not
[1:13:16] there now we've been closed
[1:13:18] it and those trees were not quite as big
[1:13:21] as they are now but they were still oak
[1:13:25] trees of you know 24
[1:13:29] in I stood have seen them bend
[1:13:34] over the wind blowing so
[1:13:38] strong now big old tree bending
[1:13:41] over ain't talking about a little old
[1:13:43] sapling now 24 in diameter tree and bend
[1:13:48] over and the limbs are almost touching
[1:13:49] the
[1:13:50] ground and stand there and say peace be
[1:13:53] still
[1:13:56] not be no more afid name H
[1:14:01] now but see it's when he comes on the
[1:14:03] scene but just remember he never leaves
[1:14:06] the
[1:14:08] scene if it's an inward piece then let
[1:14:12] the inward one take care of
[1:14:15] it well what happen something goes wrong
[1:14:19] everybody run it to the doctor s got a
[1:14:22] heart attack
[1:14:27] I standing up on a deer stand one day
[1:14:29] down in the woods about 15 18 ft
[1:14:32] up and about that time my left arm just
[1:14:36] be to ache and all down through in the
[1:14:38] side my chest and all begin to just pain
[1:14:41] like
[1:14:48] everything hey
[1:14:50] folks first thought heart attack
[1:14:53] devil says I got you now yeah you in the
[1:14:56] woods and ain't going to find you for
[1:15:00] days you know what I
[1:15:03] do I I've got enough sense to realize
[1:15:05] one thing if I was having a heart attack
[1:15:09] now watch where to be sensible about
[1:15:10] everything I realized at first if I
[1:15:13] having a heart attack that for me to be
[1:15:15] able to hug that tree and belly hug the
[1:15:17] old days was standing up this one piece
[1:15:20] stand that that was the worst thing in
[1:15:22] the world for me to do
[1:15:23] the best thing for me to do was tie
[1:15:25] myself to that seat and start hollering
[1:15:28] help and let somebody come and get me
[1:15:31] down off of there because I would use my
[1:15:33] energy to be able to get out I had
[1:15:36] enough sense to realize
[1:15:39] that that's when the devil he said yeah
[1:15:41] they won't find you for days I just
[1:15:44] laughed I said you know
[1:15:49] Lord if I'm going right here on this
[1:15:52] tree I'll be about 15 15 something like
[1:15:55] 15 18 ft up I said I I'll be that much
[1:15:59] closer to
[1:16:00] Heaven than it would be if I was on the
[1:16:03] ground so I'm going to just sit down
[1:16:05] here while
[1:16:10] hunt you know after a while the pain
[1:16:12] just went
[1:16:15] away well did you go have your heart
[1:16:17] check
[1:16:20] no now if it done it again I would
[1:16:27] because I realized somebody else had to
[1:16:29] be there if you ever had that kind of
[1:16:36] Peace ever just had it in mind and just
[1:16:40] realize what if it is the end of the
[1:16:45] world you know the only fear I have of
[1:16:48] dying
[1:16:50] is is realizing and hoping that some way
[1:16:54] my family would be able to survive
[1:16:56] that's the only fear I have of
[1:16:59] it CU
[1:17:03] why I mean one heartbeat I'm in the hand
[1:17:06] of the Lord
[1:17:09] amen but you see folks I'm just trying
[1:17:11] to get you to see Jehovah Shalom the
[1:17:15] Lord is our peace and it's an inward
[1:17:21] peace an outward peace then is what know
[1:17:26] it's like the military would try to
[1:17:28] explain to you how that you can fight
[1:17:30] this battle and and you got enough power
[1:17:32] to
[1:17:32] win but you're still
[1:17:35] scared but then when there's a peace
[1:17:38] comes you kind of like that story
[1:17:40] brother around told about the soldier
[1:17:43] that you know that was in a place and
[1:17:45] every time they send somebody up to put
[1:17:47] up a flag we'll get to that in a minute
[1:17:49] on the banner every time they send
[1:17:51] somebody up theyd shoot them down
[1:17:54] they wanted somebody to get a flag up
[1:17:55] you remember the
[1:17:57] story The Boy he
[1:18:00] said sir if you wait about 2 or 3:00 and
[1:18:04] what time it was this evening said I'll
[1:18:07] go put that flag
[1:18:12] up time came he went up the pole put the
[1:18:15] flag up bullets flying everywhere they
[1:18:17] come back
[1:18:18] down the officer asked him said why did
[1:18:21] you want to wait this time
[1:18:25] he said
[1:18:27] because my mother prays for me every day
[1:18:30] at this time of the
[1:18:32] day and said I know nothing couldn't
[1:18:37] happen cuz Mom was
[1:18:39] praying see that's a
[1:18:43] peace he is our
[1:18:47] peace Jesus said my peace I give him why
[1:18:50] be
[1:18:51] afraid now you're show you how
[1:18:53] everything ties together L if we say
[1:18:56] then that God is our
[1:18:59] savior he is our
[1:19:02] sacrifice and that we are just as
[1:19:04] righteous as he is by accepting him as
[1:19:07] our
[1:19:08] savior then we'll have peace in our soul
[1:19:12] no matter what's taking
[1:19:16] place no matter what's taking
[1:19:19] place what can bring peace to you
[1:19:22] anymore more than God's revealed
[1:19:29] word that doctor said I'll take your
[1:19:31] kneecap off I said he ain't going to do
[1:19:35] it he said they wore out I
[1:19:39] said I said you're not going to take my
[1:19:41] kneecaps
[1:19:42] off he just I laugh he life we left the
[1:19:45] office I still got my
[1:19:49] kneecap oh yeah that's been about 30
[1:19:51] years ago and the devil's real good you
[1:19:54] know what I'll get to doing a whole lot

[1:19:58] doctor's right they're going to take
[1:20:00] your knck out
[1:20:02] off but see 30 years later I
[1:20:05] mean come
[1:20:09] on but you see what about the
[1:20:13] peace now we can spend a lot of time on
[1:20:17] it do you know that Joshua one time made
[1:20:20] a peace
[1:20:21] offering
[1:20:25] you everever want to make a peace
[1:20:28] offering you don't hear much about that
[1:20:30] do
[1:20:32] you you hear about the offering for
[1:20:34] sicknesses the offering for this the
[1:20:37] offering for finances the offer what
[1:20:39] about peace
[1:20:44] offering have you ever
[1:20:47] really ever thank God for what you
[1:20:50] have or do you thank that you have got
[1:20:53] it
[1:21:01] yourself have you ever made a peace
[1:21:03] offering back to
[1:21:11] him we not old test we're not supposed
[1:21:13] to make offerings well I'm glad you
[1:21:14] thought of
[1:21:16] that but we're in the New Testament when
[1:21:18] all the offerings are inside and and
[1:21:20] everything but do you ever just inside
[1:21:21] of you do you ever think God for
[1:21:24] peace you ever lay down at night and
[1:21:27] just say thank you
[1:21:30] Lord thank you for the peace that you've
[1:21:33] given me thank you for my life the money
[1:21:36] you've given me my
[1:21:38] job my home my things
[1:21:46] everything now kids you think just make
[1:21:49] sure daddy stays okay where I can get it
[1:21:56] but what about our doing
[1:21:58] okay what about the peace that passes
[1:22:02] all
[1:22:05] understanding
[1:22:06] okay let's try to get this other one
[1:22:08] while we at it cuz we can use it right
[1:22:09] in the same line so where you there
[1:22:12] let's just go on over to
[1:22:14] Exodus
[1:22:16] 17 I'm trying to get these
[1:22:19] through Exodus 17:8
[1:22:27] I won't read it but we'll just tell the
[1:22:28] story that when it come up Ambit which
[1:22:31] had come up to fought with Israel you
[1:22:33] know all right and they were having a
[1:22:37] battle and you remember the story this
[1:22:39] is where that when the battle was going
[1:22:42] that Moses had raised his
[1:22:45] hands now am will get to it if you've
[1:22:47] looked on the things I've given you am
[1:22:49] is the type of the flesh so that's where
[1:22:51] we ought to try to conquer
[1:22:53] but old amet you know he's coming in to
[1:22:55] get them and they ready pronounce the
[1:22:58] name and Moses as long as he's holding
[1:23:01] his hands up the children of Israel was
[1:23:02] winning
[1:23:04] right but when his hands would slide
[1:23:07] down the enemy start
[1:23:10] winning so you know what happened I
[1:23:12] believe what is it Joshua and Caleb that
[1:23:13] the two that was in
[1:23:15] there they reached down and took his
[1:23:17] hands and just held him up
[1:23:21] right
[1:23:23] they just held him up held up his
[1:23:27] hands you know
[1:23:29] what the children of Israel they
[1:23:31] understood and believed in Moses real
[1:23:34] strong right cuz they had seen God and
[1:23:36] using him and the things and you look up
[1:23:40] a mountain and you see him holding his
[1:23:41] hands
[1:23:43] up you say we got
[1:23:46] it but you look up after while his hands
[1:23:48] about halfway you oh Lord Moses is
[1:23:51] losing his strength
[1:23:53] but then when you look back and you see
[1:23:54] Joshua and
[1:23:58] Caleb holding his hands
[1:24:03] up you said we're going to
[1:24:07] win go God's on our
[1:24:10] side so that's the story behind it then
[1:24:13] when you get on over look at the verse
[1:24:16] 14 and the Lord said unto Moses write
[1:24:19] this for a
[1:24:21] memorial in a book and rehearse it in
[1:24:25] the ears of Joshua for I will utterly
[1:24:28] put out the remembrance of AMC from
[1:24:30] under
[1:24:32] Heaven that's what God told
[1:24:36] Moses I'm going to wipe them
[1:24:41] out but look what Moses do and Moses
[1:24:45] built an
[1:24:47] altar and called the name of it Jehovah
[1:24:51] nasar
[1:24:53] for he said because the Lord has sworn
[1:24:55] that the Lord will have war with emets
[1:24:57] from generation to generation in other
[1:24:59] words the Lord said I'm going to destroy
[1:25:02] Amvets amlet is the top of the
[1:25:05] flesh there will be a destruction of the
[1:25:07] flesh one day because we're going to get
[1:25:09] these bodies are going to be
[1:25:11] changed that will be the closest part
[1:25:13] that you've got in all of it whether Aon
[1:25:15] and I talking about that will even tie
[1:25:17] to the Rapture but it still doesn't show
[1:25:19] The Rapture fully because that war of
[1:25:21] the flesh is still
[1:25:25] hear all right well look Jehovah Nasha n
[1:25:28] i SS I the Lord is our
[1:25:36] Banner now that's what that
[1:25:38] means Moses said I'm going to build an
[1:25:40] altar here and I'm going to call this
[1:25:42] place the Lord is our
[1:25:46] Banner now you know what a banner is
[1:25:48] it's a sign or a signate or something
[1:25:50] you ride into a place and you look and
[1:25:52] they got this great big streamer run
[1:25:53] across our says Thanksgiving Day parades
[1:25:56] 2:00 you know whatever that's a banner
[1:25:59] it's an
[1:26:00] advertisement it's a
[1:26:04] statement and see there Joshua and Caleb
[1:26:07] was making a banner upon that
[1:26:11] Hill that's why he called it a banner
[1:26:14] Jehovah
[1:26:17] Nessa because they were holding his
[1:26:19] hands up as a sign because a banner is a
[1:26:22] sign kind of re
[1:26:23] signant of something that's taking place
[1:26:26] and they realized as long as moses' hand
[1:26:28] stayed up they were going to
[1:26:33] win and there it was a banner being
[1:26:37] displayed and Moses was told of God
[1:26:40] write this what what took place and
[1:26:44] rehearse it in the ears of
[1:26:46] Joshua for I will utterly put out the
[1:26:49] remembrance of amalik from under heaven
[1:26:55] and he says I'm going to make a
[1:26:58] banner he said this place is a
[1:27:02] banner because we won the
[1:27:05] battle a
[1:27:08] banner it's a sign a standard like a
[1:27:10] pole or a
[1:27:12] signate all
[1:27:14] right Isaiah 59 and 19 says when the
[1:27:17] enemy comes
[1:27:21] in the Lord will raise up a
[1:27:24] standard a
[1:27:29] banner raise up a
[1:27:33] standard a
[1:27:35] banner the children of Israel Had Each
[1:27:39] Nation go back and study it in numbers
[1:27:41] there and you'll find it each Nation had
[1:27:45] a banner of their
[1:27:47] own Dan Ephraim Manas etc etc
[1:27:52] and they would have a banner of the or a
[1:27:55] signate or a sign that you could tell
[1:27:58] well that's the army or the people of
[1:28:00] Dan that's the people of Manasseh you
[1:28:03] know that's the
[1:28:04] people they had their own signant or in
[1:28:07] other words a
[1:28:08] code a sign and like I told you before
[1:28:12] about it when it was over in Israel and
[1:28:14] I get seeing all of these people you
[1:28:16] know they wear that little hat on the
[1:28:18] back of their head well that's what that
[1:28:19] is that's a banner of
[1:28:21] signat and and I got looking around and
[1:28:24] I'd see blue ones and I'd see green ones
[1:28:25] and I'd see black ones and I mean I
[1:28:28] don't really remember how many colors it
[1:28:29] was they're just you you know I'm
[1:28:32] interested I thought why all the
[1:28:33] different color I thought there all Jews
[1:28:36] you know
[1:28:37] Israelites and I said brother George
[1:28:39] Smith there you know I said brother
[1:28:41] George why did all these different color
[1:28:43] that little he called a name of that
[1:28:44] little hat you
[1:28:46] know and he said that
[1:28:49] shows you
[1:28:50] know what what part they are or what
[1:28:53] group they are other words you look at
[1:28:56] it you see that group you see that color
[1:28:58] that shows that we had just got baptized
[1:29:01] in the River Jordan there my wife and I
[1:29:03] and Brother Dean and his wife we just
[1:29:06] got baptized and I was kiding brother
[1:29:07] George I said where do we get us a
[1:29:10] hat he said what do you
[1:29:13] mean I said what color hat we going to
[1:29:16] wear he said what in the world are you
[1:29:19] talking about I said well I don't know
[1:29:21] what other he was you know iy asked me
[1:29:25] the other day he said that brother that
[1:29:27] was here the other week in service said
[1:29:30] are you a Jew I said yes sir he saw my
[1:29:33] little T you know tie T I'm a Jew at
[1:29:38] heart not an outward Jew know but you
[1:29:42] see each tribe had a standard or a
[1:29:45] banner all right amen but then when they
[1:29:48] got ready to
[1:29:50] move and and in their
[1:29:52] travel there was 12
[1:29:55] tribes and then when they would do it
[1:29:57] four would be here I mean 3 6 9
[1:30:03] 12 well then numbers call them a banner
[1:30:07] or a signant or a
[1:30:10] standard you know what this listed at a
[1:30:13] lion
[1:30:15] ox man and an
[1:30:19] eagle when they move those three move
[1:30:21] that was a line and the line would
[1:30:24] always go
[1:30:26] first then the O then the man and the
[1:30:30] eagle that was their
[1:30:33] Banner you followed what you're supposed
[1:30:35] to
[1:30:38] be you got impatient because they were
[1:30:41] in order to move him every time they
[1:30:43] were in order to Camping then you
[1:30:46] decide well bless God I'll camp where I
[1:30:49] want
[1:30:50] to
[1:30:52] no no you're you're sitting your baners
[1:30:54] over
[1:30:56] there well I don't
[1:31:00] care I'll do what I want to do is that
[1:31:03] kind
[1:31:04] of
[1:31:05] oh a little bit of a human
[1:31:08] nature you
[1:31:10] know you know how the best way for me to
[1:31:13] get stuff
[1:31:15] done is to tell you I don't want it done
[1:31:19] you go do
[1:31:20] it so I have to learn to use reverse
[1:31:27] psychology cuz see we're all stubborn in
[1:31:29] that I'll camp where I want to
[1:31:32] camp and I get ready to leave I'll
[1:31:37] leave that wouldn't so with
[1:31:39] Israel every man stayed in his Camp
[1:31:43] every man stayed under that Banner until
[1:31:45] they were told to
[1:31:47] move see that Lon ox man and the eagle
[1:31:50] come all the way through the the
[1:31:53] Bible right on out into what Matthew
[1:31:55] Mark Luke and
[1:31:59] John Matthew is a liive mark o John is
[1:32:06] the
[1:32:08] eagle Luke The
[1:32:11] Physician man and John is the evil you
[1:32:15] got to hold it all the way through
[1:32:17] because that's where it comes up in the
[1:32:18] Book of
[1:32:19] Revelation and God sees the
[1:32:23] Banner but you see we're not trying to
[1:32:25] worry about being the banner of the of
[1:32:27] the
[1:32:29] line the ox of the
[1:32:32] man and our day is the eagle
[1:32:34] Banner but you know what in the eagle
[1:32:37] Banner you would have all the banners
[1:32:40] enged all together in one now we do have
[1:32:44] a line the ox of man and Eagle I believe
[1:32:47] that is here now as a
[1:32:50] banner a
[1:32:54] sign we've had great things to
[1:32:58] happen when God when the enemy comes in
[1:33:01] don't worry about it what are you what
[1:33:04] are you depending on brother Dale when
[1:33:06] all the the things get worse and worse
[1:33:08] I'm depending on
[1:33:12] God I've tried my best to be sensible
[1:33:15] with
[1:33:15] you cuz I try to be
[1:33:19] sensible I've tried my best as a Pastor
[1:33:22] to explain things to
[1:33:24] you don't gohe over Hills in debt today
[1:33:27] you're going to lose your
[1:33:28] home run around and said keep your homes
[1:33:31] and take the mark of the
[1:33:36] beast so don't go out and go head over
[1:33:41] heels it'd be a good wise thing today to
[1:33:44] put up a little food to put up a little
[1:33:46] things to be able to be able to live you
[1:33:49] know that most of you probably sitting
[1:33:51] right here today you couldn't live it
[1:33:53] wouldn't for the grocery store that's
[1:33:55] right you got to go to grocery store
[1:33:57] before you can have a meal next I mean
[1:34:00] few
[1:34:04] days now I don't believe in storing up
[1:34:07] and doing all kind of things like that I
[1:34:09] think everybody in America order to put
[1:34:11] a little food
[1:34:15] aside you know something where you get
[1:34:17] you to a few
[1:34:20] days
[1:34:23] did you
[1:34:25] see laying up a banner a sign or a
[1:34:28] signal holding it let me go on get rid
[1:34:32] of
[1:34:34] it God's going to raise up a
[1:34:40] standard but now like I said this
[1:34:42] morning if we take the righteousness of
[1:34:45] God I should have should preach a whole
[1:34:47] sermon on that but I didn't I just
[1:34:50] mentioned it
[1:34:52] if you take the righteousness of God and
[1:34:54] pervert that righteousness God does not
[1:34:57] have to hear your prayers I can prove
[1:34:59] that in the
[1:35:00] Bible I got to laying on at the desk at
[1:35:05] home if we turn his righteousness into
[1:35:08] unrighteousness he does not have to hear
[1:35:11] us right
[1:35:14] amen but when the people of God that are
[1:35:19] believing the word and doing the best we
[1:35:21] can call upon God he's obligated to hear
[1:35:23] your prayer
[1:35:28] right all right now which one will it
[1:35:33] be he's obligated so he's not obligated
[1:35:36] to raise up a standard for
[1:35:40] everybody
[1:35:43] right it doesn't say when the enemy
[1:35:46] comes in like a flood that he'll raise
[1:35:47] up a standard for
[1:35:50] everybody
[1:35:52] the children of Israel in Goan had
[1:35:55] light but the people outside of Goan in
[1:35:58] Egypt was in total darkness it could be
[1:36:01] felt it was so
[1:36:08] dark now why don't you think
[1:36:11] sensible you know I know I'm carnal but
[1:36:14] you know what I do if I was an Egyptian
[1:36:17] and it got dark here and I could see a
[1:36:19] light over there I'm going to be over
[1:36:21] where that light's
[1:36:23] at I'm about sense I might not be able
[1:36:26] to get in where they're at but I'm
[1:36:28] certainly going to get close enough that
[1:36:30] I can get a little bit of raise of the
[1:36:32] light and see what's going
[1:36:34] on but it's not mentioned in the Bible
[1:36:36] that all the Egyptian went to
[1:36:39] Goan no they still had too much pride
[1:36:42] that's that
[1:36:43] ECT that's the
[1:36:46] flesh we still got too much pride within
[1:36:50] ourselves
[1:36:52] in the
[1:36:54] emage you know I used to read in the
[1:36:56] Bible go back and read you'll find
[1:36:59] it I forgot which of the name of it was
[1:37:02] but maybe I'll hit it in a minute but
[1:37:04] you know God amorites God would tell the
[1:37:07] children of Israel destroy ever
[1:37:10] Amorite men women children babies kill
[1:37:17] them they go do
[1:37:20] it
[1:37:23] two chapters later they're fighting the
[1:37:28] Amor and I thought what's going on
[1:37:33] here even if that calculated 100 years
[1:37:35] or so
[1:37:38] back between the two incidents I still
[1:37:41] wouldn't have enough time to get the
[1:37:42] people back you understand and then one
[1:37:45] day it realized I
[1:37:48] realized but I read where the amorites
[1:37:51] represented he's a flesh
[1:37:53] man go am I right did it come from um
[1:37:58] the man in his daughter come into the
[1:38:01] amorites that's right is that right Mo
[1:38:03] boites
[1:38:06] Amor when I come to find out it
[1:38:08] represent the flesh then I realize
[1:38:10] what's going
[1:38:12] on have you ever got to the place you
[1:38:14] thought you doing this good you just
[1:38:16] doing so good everything's running good
[1:38:19] you're singing you're worshiping peace
[1:38:20] PE see you do
[1:38:23] not and all it run druck bottom right
[1:38:26] you know what just happened the old
[1:38:28] Amorite rose
[1:38:30] up the amachi rose up the
[1:38:35] flesh CU that's the guy we got to keep
[1:38:37] kill
[1:38:40] him we normally kill him if we
[1:38:43] realize who is doing the
[1:38:47] fight who's going to raise up a standard
[1:38:51] God said he
[1:38:56] would let me get the end of it
[1:39:01] quick you want to read it Songs of
[1:39:04] Solomon second chapter verse
[1:39:09] 4 he tells you what his Banner
[1:39:12] is this is a banner I really
[1:39:16] want songs of Solomon if you got your
[1:39:19] marker on Ecclesiastes cuz you've been
[1:39:21] read that long enough just write There
[1:39:24] song to Solomon's
[1:39:28] next chapter 2 and verse
[1:39:34] 4 said he brought me to the
[1:39:37] banquet B excuse me house and His Banner
[1:39:42] Over
[1:39:44] Me With
[1:39:50] Love and the songs of Solomon is the
[1:39:53] little woman speaking there is the is a
[1:39:56] type of the bride of Christ and Solomon
[1:39:58] is a type of Jesus
[1:40:03] Christ all
[1:40:06] right says his Banner Over Me Is
[1:40:11] Love as I said when I started
[1:40:16] out Joshua and Caleb realized that Moses
[1:40:19] couldn't hold his hand up
[1:40:23] the banner was
[1:40:25] falling the banner was falling the enemy
[1:40:27] was defeating
[1:40:30] them so they R they just got his hands
[1:40:33] and pulled him up and they held him up
[1:40:36] till the sun went
[1:40:37] down and they've had a victory over
[1:40:40] their enemy because then Moses
[1:40:44] wrote this is
[1:40:47] the banner of the
[1:40:49] Lord Jehovah
[1:40:52] nessi the Lord our
[1:40:55] Banner do you understand what the banner
[1:40:58] was there stood three men that was the
[1:41:04] banner you remember one time when a
[1:41:06] mount called
[1:41:07] Transfiguration there was three also
[1:41:09] that were
[1:41:11] seen it was Moses and Elijah and
[1:41:14] Jesus see there's our
[1:41:19] Banner and the little bride of Christ
[1:41:21] during the songs of Solomon she
[1:41:24] says I want his Banner put over
[1:41:27] me his
[1:41:29] love there's nothing greater than love
[1:41:34] amen love the Bible says covers a
[1:41:37] multitude of
[1:41:41] sin a
[1:41:43] banner a standard a
[1:41:48] signant it's over us and that's called
[1:41:50] his love
[1:41:53] you know if you love me I don't have to
[1:41:56] worry about
[1:41:57] anything that's why I Don't Preach like
[1:42:00] most preachers preach and do all kind of
[1:42:02] things and I've told you just plain
[1:42:03] language
[1:42:05] see cuz see I ain't never worried about
[1:42:07] starving to death as long as I'm
[1:42:09] preaching to a bunch of Born Again
[1:42:12] people cuz you know what we may not all
[1:42:15] of us have very much but we will have
[1:42:19] something go if you love me you ain't
[1:42:22] going to let me starve to death I know
[1:42:24] that's natural but it's true right you
[1:42:29] know why because love is
[1:42:32] there right see that's just
[1:42:37] natural what about his Banner of love
[1:42:41] you're looking behind me you're seeing
[1:42:42] the stature of a perfect
[1:42:45] man start off Faith virtue knowledge
[1:42:48] temp fa God this brotherly kindness
[1:42:51] and then what the love of
[1:42:55] God the love of God in his bride to show
[1:42:59] His
[1:43:01] Banner brother Rand said how in the
[1:43:04] world I said to him said brother random
[1:43:06] how can you put up with those
[1:43:13] people he said I'm trying to have
[1:43:15] patience knowing that they don't have
[1:43:17] and understand this word knowing that
[1:43:20] they don't know this that and the other
[1:43:22] I'm trying to have patience with him you
[1:43:25] know what he had in his heart the love
[1:43:26] of God yes so where is our peace and
[1:43:30] where is our Banner it's not an outward
[1:43:32] sign we must make that un outward
[1:43:39] show in our religious realm we do not
[1:43:42] try to prop
[1:43:44] up but we must make our L and things in
[1:43:47] an outward
[1:43:49] show
[1:43:53] right you love kids they know you
[1:43:55] whether you love them or
[1:43:57] not
[1:43:58] right they know it none of these kids
[1:44:01] right here I could have any of them get
[1:44:03] up right now and tell they'd say brother
[1:44:04] they loves
[1:44:06] us not because I've been so generous to
[1:44:09] do and help and that but that's just
[1:44:11] part of
[1:44:12] it but they know that I love
[1:44:15] them see love covers a multitude of sin
[1:44:18] see then why can't you see things that
