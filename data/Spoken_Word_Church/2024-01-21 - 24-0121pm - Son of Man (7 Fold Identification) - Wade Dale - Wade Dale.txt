good to be in the house of the Lord just take that and keep it with you um we'll uh try to fill it in a little bit not tonight not today but just keep it with you and and uh put it in your Bible but there's some things that we're going to look at when we get into the church ages and U as we were talking this morning remember one thing the Saints would judge the Earth judgment we know was paid for at Calvary he took the Judgment of us all at Calvary right but tell you what one person saved at Calvary at that moment nope they ran from him he died alone the Bible says he died by itself the thief at the cross was the only one close enough to him to receive receive eternal life and he wasn't bride right but he was waiting on a bride to come and he gave every bit of that St John 17 that's why I said that's to me that's the Lord's Prayer to his bride Lord that they may be one as we are one all right and then now today when we're going to talk about this just a little bit brother Luis and I will speak just for a second and you got to realize we're going to see this and we think man eyes of fire and feet of brass and man he's just an angry judge no he's not judgment will be through me and you the Gentile AE will not be judged by Jesus Christ Alone the Bible said the books were open Thrones and the Saints would judge the Earth wow pretty wild but that's what he said he'll put a group of people as we were talking this morning he'll put a group of people on the Earth and the world the whole world will be judged by that group of people whoa mom we got mama here today turn that camera back there get all get it all go turn that camera back there my mother's here boy bless her heart good to have you in the house of the Lord I tell you there you go everybody there a little bit short so maybe kind of y'all bend down a little bit there you go there's one right behind you turn to look at terence's head but good to have her with us today God bless you yeah man it's good to get out but just remember keep all all in your mind what you're holding in your hand is the Bride of Jesus Christ in the church ages seven angels sent seven messages and we were talking about this morning we'll talk about it again a little more the refraction of light he is the light as we are in the light H right all the scriptures about light he is light and in him there is no Darkness at all we're going to read here in just a little while if we get down to it Revelations that city is going to be lit by me and you right me and you amen you are the light of the world right so we're going to look at the Sevenfold identification of Jesus Christ in Bride form all right so let's remember all these announcements uh remember the Roberts family remember brother Aaron that be speaking for us Wednesday night this coming Saturday the 27th at 12:00 just bring you something to eat we'll sit in fellowship with the Negron for a few hours and uh we'll have some cake for me and uh sister Tabitha

Jesus all right thank you all the way from Connecticut good drive but just remember young man and he's going to school and uh we just pray that the Lord would keep his hand on him amen all of our youth need to be protected by the hand of the Lord amen all of them everywhere they go and what they do the devil just got a little in he can try to get in there as best he can but we have a stronger God we have a stronger God more powerful more better than anything else that Satan's got to give you okay all right it may look tantalizing over here but the the longevity the he waited God's waited 6,000 years to get this day right here patiently waited to get this bride here because this is the last one last Church age last of the G then we know he goes to the Jews but for us it'll be over here in just a little while so remember these announcements and we're going to start on the Sevenfold identification dear heavenly father Lord thank you again for being with us thank you for giving us a wonderful service Lord I pray that you'd bless now in the furth of this service you speak to the people Lord give them something that lord they're pulling on the gift Lord so you just walk down their aisle Lord and give them what they need today Father Lord be with the ones that are not here that are sick Lord be with the ones that are sin sick father I pray Lord that as the time is getting shorter that the pull will become greater and and we'll be able to to pray them for them Lord and get them Lord back in church father and let them Serve You Lord in spirit and in truth father forgive us of our mistakes and faults Lord thank you for this message thank you for this salvation that we have Lord it it's just so precious and we we don't want to we don't want to be milor we want to to Lord be fervent in our in our preaching and in our prayer Lord that you would bless each one Lord that's here today Father and inside this building Lord I pray that you would sanctify us Lord wash Us by your water bless us now Lord in Jesus name amen so the son of man Sevenfold identification now now remember the son of man is what it was Jesus Christ but he's gone he's come back in Bride form he not in the Baptist denomination everybody understand me all right he could be in the people and work through the people but as far as that denomination he's not there he's in Bride form in the message of the hour all right now I didn't exclude people he did he said I hate that nickan Spirit now you say God hates yeah he does God has emotion hello that's where if we were made his enemies then we have that same emotion we just have a human side of it that we got to get rid of all that other stuff that's why this right here to be we get rid of our own self our own self stuff and then what be be what be diligent toward him and what he wants so Revelations 1:10 says I was in the spirit on the Lord's day I heard behind me a great voice of of trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou seest write in a book and send it into the seven churches which are in Asia Ephesus Smyrna now we'll get into this but you know these each one were cities right they were real cities were real people living in them but their character just I say happened to fit that age it didn't just happen to do that no they fit it perfectly God put them right where they needed to be so he could talk about them God put you right where you need to be today so he can talk about you all right and it's a smrna pergusa Sardis Philadelphia and Le DEA and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about the PS with a golden girdle his head and his hair were white as wool we're going to get into that in just a little bit as white as snow and his eyes were as flame of fire his feet like in Define brass as it burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many Waters he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength you may be seated in the Lord as his Blessing to the reading of the word now that word mxed in my DST means among or from among are in the middle all right and not just in the middle as we saw this we'll see it here in just a minute he has outstretched hands and his hand stretches from alpha to Omega all right and everything in between he was but but what he's the reason he brings so much with Alpha which you know what Alpha and Omega is right that's uh Greek letters right Alpha and Omega Alpha's first EG you know you always say alpha male alpha wolf and Alpha that's why I go this first it's the most powerful then Omega over here which is the end of everything all right and he says I am Alpha and Omega he do omit that in between but he says whatever I got here this is the way I started my church it's going to be eroded down through the church ages but at the end I'm going I will restore sayith the Lord he's going to restore us back to the faith of the Fathers as brother R said the messenger of Malachi 4 to do two things one take us back to that but then tell us why right tell us how to get back to it and then how to take a body change all right cuz remember I don't know if you caught that this morning or not but you got seven virtues well they've got to go through one prism right which is number eight God's always Eternal he's always standing in a number as always seven and then you say well well there he is he's the prism we have to go through him he's the door all right everybody with me all right and there's the uh there's the picture that we were looking at he's standing in the midst with the eyes like flames of fire his his hair was like wool and we'll try to explain some of these and let brother random do it Seven Stars listen I really enjoy when he talk when he talks about all this when when you see John John's going to stand there and John's going to listen to what Jesus said now he saw Jesus in in in real life now he sees him glorified all right he's a young man but now he's got a girdle up here he's GED about the paps or across the shoulder with a golden girdle now he wasn't that way because remember I'll get to in just a minute you got to remember priest and Kings what did a priest do priest had to be dressed right priest had to administer what to the people or he had to go in the holy of holies and all that we we'll explain that in just a minute but he just saw Jesus as Jesus really didn't understand who he was until he came back on the day of Pentecost and went inside of John everybody with me all right so that's what he's seeing now a glorified Jesus but he is being shown right off the bat with a golden girdle up here feminis so bride form no other form but bride form all right everybody with with me but remember the son of man Revelation got lost in the church ages the son of man Revelation was that he was God you baptized in his name hell was not Eternal amen that got lost down through here so the Omega bride to bring Christ back here in its fullness of the godhead bodily to bring it back here it's got to go back to there to get that Revelation but then bring it back up here all right everybody with me that's where we're standing today with the full Revelation just like Paul Peter remember somebody told Brother Ram one time said oh brother R said what you have what you have we could write another book he said oh I sounded good he said but that'd be adding too so it's contained in those seven colors are those 66 books everything we need amen there's nothing new coming there's not a new Bible the only thing new is coming is your body that's what's coming but it's already written in the Bible and some people have already come to it Abraham got a new body but remember he died you won't he won't either that's why he says I'm the first and the last I I've got all the keys I um I'll read it this a little bit later in the chapter he says I've conquered death in hell I got the keys to the house I've done all this for you now go John write this to my people and give it out over the church ages and I'm going to form myself in a bride which is me and you and all the ones that down through the church ages all those too but remember they formed they formed a color of the rainbow the SE they formed a color but that color didn't bend toward a body down here that was being changed they're waiting on us to come to that place and to refract the light of then we got to go back to the son of man which is the white light right we go back to the white light bring the white light here and then everything is molded up in that white light which is the fullness of the godhead bodily in a bride not a eess a fullness cuz that's what's standing right here this is the fullness of the godhead bodily is standing before you in picture form but that's him and his characteristics and he's standing in the middle of the church or bride all right everybody with me okay flame of fire hair like wool he wasn't old sharp two-edged sword we'll get to those in just a few minutes all right and then feet like brass so just to recap this morning what does do a prism do as light passes through a prism it it is bent or refracted because listen we can't the first church age be it the first church age that it is it was close but it was not the fullness of the godhead bodily it was part of the light second age was what a color part of the light but that white light is the whole light I am the light of the world he said I I'm the one that come to light this world up but oh my that he caused he caused people to go into darkness he caused them to go into darkness cuz he was here it didn't he didn't make them but remember when you bring a messenger we read it this morning a messenger comes on Earth immediately there's a war immediately there's a separation listen when there's a war going on you got to choose a side you can't be neutral some people tried to be be neutral I believe it was maybe Missouri and Kentucky and different ones they want to stay neutral between the North and the South no you get drugg in one way or the other all right I don't want to stay neutral I want to be on the winning side and I don't want to be one of them fair weather fans that waits till this one looks like it's about ready to win then I jump in God May fool you you may jump in and your horse die you know so what does the prism do to light as light passes through the prism it's bent or refracted by the angles in plain faces of the prism and each wavelength look each wavelength of light light comes in a wave all right it's refracted by a slightly different amount ever so slightly that it one Blends into the other when you see a rainbow you see the color starting from violet or Indigo and it just Blends all the way through the other colors you don't see indigo then you see a gap and then you see yellow and then you see a gap and no they're all together but they run down and you can see them if you see a really pretty rainbow you can see all the pictures of it all the but they don't they're separate each age is separate but we have one light but the word let's just say it that way the word is refracted by a slightly different amount like I said before Luther's refraction of light or bending of light was the just shall live by faith right it was a color right it was in God's rainbow but now when Luther went to sleep and took the bride with him to sleep they went to sleep Wesley comes on the scene he bends it just a little bit more you can't just live by faith you can't go drink beer and and smoke a pipe in this age God said I'm a wink at that but I require our Holiness cuz I required it back in the first church age all right you understand where we're going then all right you got an age that age got sealed away baptism of the Holy Ghost Bride of Jesus Christ will judge their time period but now if you come to even come to our time Luther is not even going to get you in Brad form in our age why the light's being bent just a little bit more right where we can see another color of that white light that's why brother R said you know you red through Red's white he tells all these different colors we'll not get into that I don't want to I don't want to muddle the water up we can if we do it later on but not now but this is an example of it I didn't show you this morning when light passes from one substance to another it changes Direction now listen it doesn't do away with it you don't do away with God and you don't change him who changes we do we change to reflect his light which is bent in a little different way CU like I said but now see praise God if if Luther would have would sit here come here today come into this church not that I'm preaching any brother preaches brother Bob this this morning anybody and sit right there the Holy Ghost Inside of him would refract the light that he saw first he'd run it through his filter through his prism and say man I ain't never thought of that I got to change my thought process I can't go down and drink a beer in a pub and smoke a pipe he would believe this message of the hour because it's the same Holy Ghost but see God saw fit that Luther would make it in this age the man would fit the characteristics and that William Brandon would fit his right here how many people would you know that had that much power as you were watching or listening here where brother brandham had control of the whole building now some people that I know if you give them that much power they use it wrong maybe us included but brother brandham knew he was the most humble man he had the power he had the power to cast him two and make them to U the people that were having making love in the in the thing he said what Holy Spirit said you just say whatever it is he said oh I forgive them inside of us it'd be like they're interrupting the service they're doing this they're doing that I get rid of them Lord no he didn't get rid of me and you did he okay so when life passes from one substance to another it changes Direction This effect is familiar to all of us from observations in bathtubs and swimming pools and it's called refraction actually too and and if you look at it this way the refraction of a certain light now a certain light causes a mirage I didn't bring that but we were I was looking it up last night so what's a mirage it's fake but it's the bending of light you look out in the summertime you drive down the road and and if you ever if the light hits the the pavement just right what does it do it just glows right it don't even look like pavement don't look black it shines amen well that's what the refraction of that light is which Satan is also I didn't want to bring him in this he's a messenger of light hello and now what he said the Bible calls him that yeah so he's got his own refraction of light his own Mirage that he brought into the church age and defiled it made it lukewarm said oh that's beautiful looks like palm trees that father son Holy Ghost baptism man that's got to be it because Jesus said it right that's got to be right how many people told you that when you start talking to about water baptism they said well I'll tell you what Jesus said you tell you what Peter said I said well then the whole Bible's confusing them because he said something one here over here and in Peter he gave Peter the Keys of the Kingdom I said Jesus didn't even have the keys at the time Peter had the keys he unlocked the door and it was the Lord Jesus Christ all right everybody with me on that so this effect is familiar and it's also like I said before you put a straw in here and it looks like it's broke it's a refraction of light so Satan can be a messenger of light but it's his own light but it's so so close that we've got to see we got to see with eyes that's why the Bible tells us in our church age it's got to be the iav the Kung grease as brother Brandon was talking about that you put on the eyes and get the matter out of your eyes you know why cuz you don't matter somebody get that upon Passage through the prism the white light is separated into church ages remember even across the curtain of time brother brandom couldn't find Paul couldn't find arenius couldn't find Martin he found his own group of people cuz they reflected the light of that messenger for that day so that white light is separated into red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet and then you like we were talking about you put it through that prism but look what the prism is listen even a diamond or something flat will not refract light it has to be in an angle that's why we'll read a quote here in just a little while brother R talking about the future home he said that's why that that's why that mountain in that City had to be at an angle because the light refraction right we'll explain it in a minute then we talked about the allseeing a yall know about that so we'll get we'll just going through this each AG age had its message and its messenger all through time every age has packed his message with a messenger god and every dispensation has sent forth someone Anointed with the Holy Spirit to bring forth his message for that age every time God's Gift always find the places 1963 God gave his word so much here so much here so much here for each age then he sent a prophet down anointed to make that word come to pass and look it supports the other ones it didn't tear him down brother R didn't go across curtain time say now Paul preached something different than me bless God I'm Church AE messenger for number seven and he was number one he didn't know nothing now he said where's Paul he said he's in in other words he's another dimension he said well did I did did Paul preach and me preach the same thing he said well yeah he said well I made it then if Paul made it I made it right so he didn't tear each other down there the only thing you tear down is you false Doctrine true Doctrine can it's like brother Bob said you take a true Doctrine a true teacher a true uh whatever you want to call it if they confuse the people more when they walk out the door when they come in that's not a gift it might be a gift but it's from the wrong person this is supposed to simplify everything but listen let me add a a little caveat in there that brother Bob didn't if you ain't got something inside of you to receive it it will be confusing I don't care if you give them the ABCs you got to have the Holy Ghost inside of you to react to what's going to be said all right then then you open your heart up if you got the Holy Ghost it's not a problem to open your heart up cuz who's there God all right so then he sent a prophet down anointed to make that word come to pass now look anointed to make that word come to pass and it supports the other one that was coming see like the Messiah always supported every Prophet prophet in his own life his own being the word that was given for that day he come and fulfill that written word and foretold of what the other one was going to be in other words he's talking about the Old Testament now where Isaiah Ezekiel and all different ones they were supporting that there was a Christ coming there was an anointed one coming that Jesus was coming they didn't call him by name but they knew one was coming Moses said they'll raise up one like unto me okay and every one of them spoke of him talk about Christ cuz he was the fullness he was the head of the prophets he was the word of God he was the prophets amen there he is notice how wonderful what he was each one of those prophets Now The Seven Ages are set forth in Revelations chapter 2 like I said before chapter one is what we're going to deal with today it tells you who he is and where he's at right so establishes and then it goes right in it says to the messenger of the Church of Ephesus all the way to Revelation chapter 3 the very end where we're at and then Revelation chapter 4 you go up through the open door all right the bride does John typed the bride John was caught up in Revelations 4:1 right so that's us so The Seven Ages are set forth in Revelation Chapter 2 and 3 takes in the whole span of the fullness of the Gentiles now see we're not talking about Jews we're not talking about anything else but bride what you got in your hand that that Candlestick that's got all those um circles in it if you don't know what well I didn't pull it up if you get your little thing out and you see the black part the black part is the blackness in the age the white part of that circle is the Bride of that age now remember in the last Church age when when brother randam drew the ages the angel that Drew them on the wall Drew him black in the seventh age no light at all he said I added a little light why because it's just a little light that's shining here and that's us but as I was saying before Oh I was telling we talk this morning downstairs this is the darkest age that ever was but it's got the most light Bible says if that light in you be Darkness how great is that Darkness that's why the United States of America's just great as we are we're going to fall at the feet of somebody because of the rejection of the message that came right at your doorstep in English all the technology all the electronics everything we have that the people over in other countries barely get a few books they get more now than they used to but 20 years ago I mean if you couldn't find a paperback book you in trouble but now you can get them on you know little cassette form and have all the message on it praise God for that that you don't have to Lug a tape recorder back into the jungle and run off of batteries all right the whole time in which God is dealing with the Gentiles under salvation talks about that church age you're looking at it says the very same thing in opening and closing the message of each age unto the messenger of now remember the messenger gets it first but he that hath an ear let him hear not what Luther said us but what Luther said in his age his people then then Wesley I told somebody I told U Methodist the other day well I did yeah I told him I said look I said if if if what's going on in your church the United well it ain't United Methodist even unless you have gays and all that in it I said John Wesley didn't preach that John Wesley was a fire brand snatched out of the fire you know he was supposed to died he was in a second story bu house he was on the second floor that's why they call him his daddy called him that that he was a fire brand snatched out of the fire because somebody happened to look up and saw him against a window beating on the window and the house was completely consumed and he finally got something and hit the wall hit the you know the glass and jumped down in somebody's arms basically he was and then the thing collapsed course this is in 1800s they was wasn't the fire department there you know it was that Bucket Brigade a little bit of little bit of well he would have died and his daddy told him he said you're you're a fire brand snatched out of of the fire he was the last one of all the kids to get out they looked they found everybody else but him and they couldn't find him and he was upstairs somewhere but you you read the story I read the story about him here just a little bit ago but he was a fire brand though because then he took that fire and preached 14,000 sermons in his life he preached five sermons a day to five different groups of people I'll be 64 Friday I don't expect that to happen unless the Lord just really gives me a surge one a day two a day five a day could you imagine preaching five sermons a day they kicked him out of a place one time let let me tell you a little story about how the god gets the message out John John Wesley was preaching in a place and they kicked him out all right he couldn't find a place that they weren't kicking him out except on top of his daddy's grave it was a mum that come I mean not a mum like this but it came up in a slab like this they they buried him top on top of the ground so he goes to the cemetery jumps up on his daddy's grave he dares anybody to get on that with him cuz that's his daddy's and that's his property and he stood there and preached to you know several hundred people they couldn't kick him out you see how God gets his message he he just thought he said man my daddy's buried right out here cuz they they hated his daddy too if you'll remember that if you'll read about him they hated John Wesley's daddy kicked him out of every church that but he was preaching the word of God he was trying his best to do the best he could at the time but he was setting a stage for his son he he literally was setting a stage for his son do you get what I'm just saying by his death he set a stage for his son to stand on to preach Julie got it praise the Lord thank you sister but that's how the message got out he and he and he never stopped they kick him out of one place he'd go preach in another he' go find another place he could stand and then they run him out there and they go preach in another place where he can stand like Paul did the same thing they were going to kill Paul several times whipped him till almost he was dead did that stop him nope you're not going to stop the word of God it is absolutely going to get out whether we like it or not that's right notice here that Jesus by the spirit in every age addresses himself to only one person Rel Rel ative to the word for that age only one messenger for each age receives what the spirit has to say to that age and that one messenger is the messenger to the true church he speaks for God by Revelation to the churches both true and false the message is then broadcast to all but though it is broadcast for all who come within range of the message that message is received individually by only a certain qualified qualified group in a certain way each individual of that group is one who has the ability to hear what the spirit is saying by the way of the messenger the Two Sisters sat in church he said he called me a a vulture one said he called me an eagle same sermon all right those who hear are not getting their own private Revelation nor is a group getting their Collective Revelation as brother Rob was talking about you got to hear it from a five-fold Ministry and you got to go to church it's got to just I'm sorry that's the way God put it amen you can't get it at home by yourself yeah you can get Revelation but you're not going to get growth without doing what God Said sorry you just not we're we're not did you did you learn all your schooling and sitting at your house right that's what I thought those who here are not getting their own private Revelation nor is a group getting their Collective Revelation oh we've got this over here and y'all don't have it over but each person is hearing and receiving what the messenger has already received from God all right it takes a message first then delivers it to you and I we were talking about that this morning so here's the plan of it brother R tells us right here here's the plan of it in the first seal all right the first thing happens there's an announcement in heaven first what happened a seal is opened what is it a mystery is unfolded see and when a mystery unfolds then a trumpet sounds it declares a war or a plague Falls and a church age is open and we'll look at that chart we'll draw some few things on it maybe later on and see how they all blend together all right but they're separate but there is an overlap in between that that you'll see what is the war part the angel of the church catches the mystery of God not fully yet revealed but when he does he catches this mystery of God and then he goes forth to the people after the mystery has been given to him Goes Forth to the people what does he do out there he begins to Proclaim that message and what does it start starts a war a spiritual war we were talking about that this morning believe you me it's going to get worse believe you me it's going to get worse right you look now and see the people leaving the message families are dividing churches are closing their doors you can't even get in a tabernacle anymore can you brother Lis you can't get in a tabernacle it's locked they stay closed for renovation yeah okie dokie then you can take that two or three different ways and then God tell just saying I heard they were going to make a museum out of it boy brother Brandon would have enjoyed that and then God takes his messenger with the elect of that age and lays them away asleep then he drops a plague upon them who rejected it why they close it off and they rejected not you who was he talking he said not rejecting you they're rejecting me God said they rejecting me yeah they're not rejecting you they're rejecting me because I'm speaking through you and therefore they're rejecting me then as a temporary judgment and then after that is over then he goes on they denominate bring in denominations and start off of that man's work like of Wesley all the rest of you think about John Wesley how much he preached and all that effort he put into that church and see it now so fragmented allowing gays and women and all doing in the church to preach Right Wesley would have burnt well no he wouldn't have burned it physically but he would have burnt their hide yeah he preached Holiness but you but now wait a minute Wesley was a church age messenger he started a move of wesleyian or or the Wesley move right and it was ordained of God right what happened other men got involved in it and what eroded it or broke it down to where the original didn't listen this Methodist Church don't look like the original and listen the only thing it looks like the first church age is sitting here today you ought to be happy that God's give us that he's G us that ability we think oh great Paul great John great Peter great you're great you got the same God in you they did you got the same Alpha now is omega you got same thing they got plus a body change that's why the seals had to be open they weren't open in the first age second third fourth fifth sixth they open in the seventh age we'll get to that when we get to the seventh age and it look it gets all scrapple again and then another mystery comes forth what happens another messenger arrives on Earth for a church age then when he arrives the trumpet sounds he declares a war then what happens finally when he's caught away then when he's laid away a PL Falls destroys them spiritual death hits the church and that's exactly what's happened to the Wesley movement and that's exactly what's happened to the message movement spiritual death hit the church because they don't even go anymore and she's gone that group then he goes on to another one Revelations 1: 18 says I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending sayith the Lord which is and which was and which is to come the Almighty I John who also am your brother and companion in Tribulation and in the kingdom of God and patience of Jesus Christ was on the island that is called patmas for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last now God's saying this so I feel safe saying exactly what Jesus said that's right right right have yall noticed when you look in your Bible you know in Matthew Martin Luke and John's read letter because that's what Jesus spoke right they consider that what he spoke go to your Bibles and look right now if you need to in Revelations verse chapter one it's in red letter this is not in red letter cuz I put it in red letters in red letter because it's in your Bible the even the scholars picked up that Jesus was speaking to John praise the Lord can't get it wrong when Jesus is speaking saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last what thou seest write in a book and send it into the seven churches which are in Asia then he pronounces them and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one lik un to the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gir about the paps with a golden girdle here's two translations I was in daddy studying he's got a Bible he got 26 translations so I was reading it the emphatic diglot which is the original The Way It Was Written it's you're g at the breast all right which or about or at the breast or mfet says a belt of gold around his breast gold signifies what deity I've read y'all that quote time and time again when when you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost deity resides inside of you it proves it right here when John saw this Vision or whatever he was was looking at he saw Jesus Son of Man Standing with gold about his pths right seven Church ages this is in 1954 you know brother Brian preached him in 1954 but he preached him like all in one sermon but then he comes back and preaches them later on in the midst of the seven golden counil counter States like like unto the son of man what one like him who was this his bride one like him watch How It Was clothed with a garment down to the foot the Holiness of Jesus Christ covering her has washed us from our sins with his own blood all right he says G about the PS not a man a woman with a golden girdle the gospel that held the power and glory of God over the body of Christ 1954 the mark of the beast is we found the church standing there in its beauty Christ just molded into to it and the church had a white garment on and you notice it was a woman around the breast it had the Garment covering over her shame and was had a golden cord though pulled around so that it held around the breast white speaking of the righteousness of Christ and the golden cord represented the gospel all right the preaching of the Gospel brings the Holy Spirit over the church listen you're not corrected by a preach preacher you're corrected by the Holy Spirit through the word of God right the righteousness of Christ holds it there tied with a string the girdle string patas Vision 1960 now let's watch him just further as we take the rest of this verse and in the midst that's in the middle of the golden candlesticks one lik un to the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and GED about the PPS with a golden girdle now here's more proof of that this Doctrine is right about it being the Lord's day now he went back and we know this we don't have to go over it again it wasn't a 24-hour day John was there for two years the day of the Lord is the day you're in not a 24-hour day give us this day our daily bread is just say just give it one time don't give it anymore no that's the day of the Lord some of y'all eat too much bread between Services I told y all them carbs you get to you brother um brother kar's back there wide eyed and bushy tail cuz he didn't eat today it might be something let us have a fast between service no I tell you it is hard I mean you eat pasta or you eat some kind of rice or something and it does it it gets you pretty uh let's make a word car um carbonized by carbohydrates you get carbonized no it's you get sleepy but look watch this now this is where we L was talking about this is where he'd never seen this like this before and and and there's a lot of times we have pieces that we don't see preachers do that he was not a priest during this time he transferred that to me and you neither was he a king he was a judge because in righteousness the Bible said he will judge well now what is the glory of God it's the righteousness of his Saints it all connects back to me and you that's why brother brandom he everybody's like no this is the church everybody's part of the church we all look alike we all if y'all look a little different that's okay but brother R stood one day and said no this is the bride this is the way she acts amen this is the way the bride acts this is the way the church acts now a priest a high priest when he went into the sanctuary and went into to minister to service he tied himself around the waist all right everybody with me shake yourself just a little bit tying his girdle around the waist meant that he was serving right never tied it over his shoulder but here he comes out walking out with a girdle tied around the top with a sash over his shoulder gted about to pouch the breast with a golden girdle gted up high what is it an attorney a judge now hang with me for a minute he's still the Prince of Peace he's still the King of Kings he still all that right but when it comes to here when John turns and looks and sees that he is glorified so he's standing in the midst of the church and he's got his arms out and and basically what this whole part of me says is is these are my people and I'm going to judge the World by these people right here by the symbols I'm fixing to give to you and just now it's all about judgment cuz if you what remember if you turn down the messenger it's immediate judgment I'll read it to you in a minute he's an attorney a judge the judge with his sash over his shoulder gted up here not down as a priest see that shows he wasn't in his priesthood now John went all the way over into the Lord's day and saw him coming as a judge right all right everybody with me right here here 1963 we'll go back to what brother R says God takes his messenger with the elect of that age lays them away asleep don't let's don't Premed let's don't pre let's don't do it right now okay lays them away asleep and then he drops a plague upon them that rejects it a temporary judgment all right so now whoever rejected Paul listen whoever rejected Paul got a temper judgment well you know what that temporary judgment though is just temporary because it's a white Throne judgment that same judge is going to stand here but it ain't going to be Christ it's going to be Paul right it's going to be his people the Lord Jesus is going to stand there and said hey I judge you by them people right here did you turn Paul down were you one of those people that picked a rock up to Stone him well yeah I didn't like what he said well who judged him you were judged right there that's why the Bible tells us and I'll read it here in a few minutes when I get to it you're not even supposed to take a brother or a sister to court I mean a brother and sister somebody f with the Holy Ghost you do you problems inside now listen if you got if you're wronged out there and they're a bunch of Scoundrels if you sue them sue them take them to court whatever but not a brother and a brother or a sister and a sister the Bible's real plain about that and it says how can you judge here and you're going to stand and judge the world if you don't be able to judge here you're not going to be able to judge there then God takes his messenger with the elect of that age and lays them away asleep then he drops the plague upon them who rejected it a temporary judgment all right let's look at number one his head and his hair were white like wool as white as snow and the patus vision brother R says look John first notices and mentions the whiteness of his hair that's the first thing he mentions it was white and as bright as snow that was not because of his age oh no the brilliantly white hair does not signify age but look experience maturity and wisdom see that the Eternal one does not age what is time to God time means little to God but wisdom means much right right that's why we we been on the statute of perfect man you don't know how to judge unless you got something to judge by would you like to have an attorney that was been out that went to grammar school and decided to take your case that's what I thought Bob that look good wouldn't it I graduated 12 grade I I I can I can take this $25 billion contract yeah I think I can win it you get tore to Pieces is what you'll do but man that one with experience Hey listen lawyers are shrewd they know how to articulate they can take one word and change a whole change a whole courtroom setting one word an A or an and or a the or a but they can say oh well even the world understands this symb symbology for an ancient time the judge would appear in convene Court dressed in a white wig and a long robe that signified his complete author now look his complete Authority head to foot robe to meet out Justice right 1 Corinthians 6 verse1 says dare any of you here having a matter against another go to law before the unjust and not before the Saints do you not know that the saint shall judge the world and if the world shall be judged by you are you unworthy to judge the smallest matter know ye not that we shall judge Angels how much more things pertain to this life all right so his hair is white as wool if you watch over in London they do that in England and when they have court doesn't matter what color the guy's hair is he puts on a white wig you've seen movies Netflix has got them all over the place ask Louise he'll tell you he's the only one that's got a Netflix account in this building right that's what I thought don't raise your hand but if you watch an old movie what that's a judge and he's the Supreme guy he walks in he sits down he's got the wig on it doesn't matter if he's 20 years old or or you know 80 he's come to a place of authority so the bride has got to come to a place of authority so that she can present herself as a judge and that's powerful but see that's the first thing John saw he started at the head and headed down all right by look and his eyes were as a flame of fire brother R said those fiery flame eyes of the judge are even now recording the lives of All Flesh running to and fro throughout the Earth there is nothing he does not know he knows the desires of the heart and what each one intends to do there is nothing hidden that shall not be revealed for all things are naked before him with whom we have to do think of it he knows even now what you're thinking H some are not because you don't think when you sleep Zechariah 4:10 for who ha despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and see the plummet in the hand of zerubabel remember what is zerubabel doing he's building this great Monument or this great statue stature with these seven they are the eyes of the Lord Seven running to and fro through the Earth what are the eyes the eyes are what they're the gateway to the soul there are some things I wish I'd never seen in my life cuz I can't get them out of my head well pray for me there's things I got stuck in this head that I wish I could turn that my eyeballs off but you can't but you can deal with it Lord gives you power over that okay but he look at John he he's got he sees wisdom he sees that that there's eyes not like eyes he's ever seen before and they're watching over the church ages all right in judgment but not to judge because remember that whole part of the son of man that's the bride form so the bride is standing there with all that on that's what you got to get the bride is standing there with all that the white robe I mean the white robe the wig the eyes that's you that's that's the characteristics of all Church ages put together God had eyes in every Church age God had wisdom in every Church age and he'll judge with that wisdom out of every Church age right and his feet was liking toine brass as if they burned in a furnace now look brass is noted for its remarkable hardness now we know brass means judgment anyway all right there is nothing that is known that you can put with it to temperate but this brass that describes his feet is more remarkable yet and that it has stood the test of the fiery furnace he's not talking about Jesus at the moment he's talking about your trials and your tribulations things you overcome remember we're going to get into the church ages he that overcometh what what do you overcome with those feet of brass a test that no other one has gone through amen and that is exactly right for brass signifies Divine judgment a judgment that God decreed and brought to pass the serpent on the pole is the top of what Jesus coming to the Earth to accomplish now how does God heal how did he heal down through the seven Church ages did he just walk did he just come in by the holy in spirit and say I heal you no brother Donnie pray for me I'm sick there's your there's your there's your snake on the pole what did he saying Moses if you'll look at it remember they had all kind of disease if you'll look at that pole that brass serpent you'll be healed what did Peter say and John say at the gate beautiful look to Jesus look to Jesus no they didn't say that right he said look on us look on us the Brazen serpent is right here look on us anybody you pray for somebody you have become that solid brass that part of the serpent on a pole right the foundation of the altar of sacrifice was solid brass typifying the lamb slain before the foundation of the world judgment had already passed upon him when as yet there were no Sinners salvation being entirely of the Lord now watch but someday those feet of brass will stand upon the earth and the judge of all the Earth he shall be and with equity and Perfection will he judge man kind what through the bride and there will be no evading that judgment listen part of us being taken away brother John is that we're not part of Judge judement yet when we leave our Feet's in glory that's right for three and a half year wedding supper while the wrath of God is poured out on the unbelievers and why he pouring out on them cuz we're gone that's right hello come on somebody because we're gone the reason this world is not being destroyed right now is because me and you cuz our brass walks on the earth our judgment walks on the earth cuz somebody else has got to be judge until the Gentile dispensation be over oh we're looking for the last one I'm looking for the last one that portrays every one of these seven who I'm looking for CU remember the bride is the son of man in the end time we're the fullness of every bit of this we don't get a piece we don't get a part it's the fullness and the judge of all the Earth he shall be and with equity and Perfection will he judge man kind and there will be no evading that judgment no turning of that Justice there will be no tempering of it he that is unjust will be unjust still he that's filthy will be filthy still the unchanging one will not change then for he never has and he never will that's right those feet of BR brass will crush the enemy and listen you got to have a feet of brass cuz we're going to crush the enemy here by the body change right amen right they will destroy the Antichrist who's they I thought it was him he say they they will destroy the Antichrist the Beast and the image and all that's vile in his sight he will destroy the church system that have taken his name only to corrupt its Brilliance and crush them along with the Antichrist all the wicked The Atheist agnostic martinis the Liberals will all be there death hell and the grave will be there yes they will for when he comes the books will be open that is when even the lukewarm church and the five foolish virgins will appear he will separate the sheep from the goats when he comes he will take over the kingdom for it is his and with him will be the thousands times 10 thousands his bride who come to minister to him glory repent before it's too late this voice is the sound of many Waters we go back to re Revelations 10 in the days of the voice everyone had a voice and his voice is the sound of many Waters now what do the waters represent the waters which thou sawest Revelation 17 are people and multitudes Nations and tongues just a group of bride the bride right his voice was as a sound of multitudes speaking what is it it is the Judgment for these are the voices of the multitude of witnesses now not witnesses there Witnesses here who by the Holy Spirit look All Through the Ages have testified to Christ and preached his gospel it will be the voice of every man rising in judgment Against The Sinner who would not take warning the voices of the seven Messengers will be heard loud and clear those faithful preachers who preach the saving power of Jesus who preached water baptism in Jesus name who preached the infilling and power of the Holy Ghost who stood with the word more than they stood with their own lives all of them were the voice of Jesus Christ by the Holy Ghost down Through the Ages Revelation chapter four all right here's the voice how we need in Jeffersonville thousands of lived voices the Thunder of God thundering out in sweetness and Holiness Purity undefiled lives walking around in the Earth today without a blemish yes sir real Christians that's the Thunder against the enemy the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil don't care how much you can jump or how much you can do this or shout but What Hurts The Devil is to see that Sanctified now wait a minute that Sanctified holy life when we get a glorified body man that'll be that's what no that ain't it here in between those outstretched hands the Alpha and Omega that's where we get perfected you don't get perfected here you're not going to be perfect there perfected there you got to get it here what through thousands of voices speaking thundering out everybody wants to know what Thunder is that's what a thunder is it's a lived life holy life consecrated to God say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as can be and move right on oh my that throws him away and that's the Thunder that shakes the devil Rapture message is 1965 now the first thing is the sounding the first thing is a trumpet or a voice a shout then a voice then a trumpet a shout is a messenger getting the people ready the second is a voice of the Resurrection the same voice a loud voice in St John 11:38 that called Lazarus from the grave I look getting the bride together through the voice the two-edged sword and then the resur rection of the Dead see to be caught up with it now watch and he had in his hand right hand Seven Stars this is what got me the other day I was thinking Lord you know we you've got all these things set up but you put them people in your hand you didn't you didn't let an angel do it you did it yourself you have them in your hand and if you got them in your hand there's no way you can make a mistake right amen he picked those Church age Messengers by the characteristics of the age and the person that fit it in his right hand were Seven Stars he had his right hand Seven Stars now of course we already know from verse 20 that who the seven stars seven stars are the mystery of the Seven Stars are the Angels or messengers of the seven churches now we can't make couldn't make a mistake here on any account as he interprets it for us like I said before God Jesus is standing there his hand is out stretch Seven stars are in his hand they're connected can't make a mistake when God's got you in his hand these Seven Stars Are The Messengers to the seven successive Church ages they are not called by name they are just set forth as seven one to each age from the Ephesian age on down to this lean age each messenger brought the message of Truth to the people never failing to keep it the word of God to that particular Church age each one held it they were steadfast in their loyalty to the original light the white light through the prism they were steadfast in their own loyalty to the original light as each age pulled away from God though his faithful Messengers turned that age back to the word their strength was from the Lord or they never should have stem could have stemmed the tide they were safe in his care for nothing could pluck them out of his hands in other words he had a messenger sitting here named Paul he had a guy waiting in the wings called irenius another one Martin colum but he had them waiting and ready to go in his mind then when they got the Holy Ghost he just give them what they needed nothing could pluck them out of his hand PMA vision and this Comfort is not for the seven Church age Messengers only oh I forgot to tell y'all y'all are included in this and this Comfort is not for the seven Church age Messengers only every True Believer is in the hand of God and can draw from his love and power and receive the full benefit of all that God is to the believer what God gives the messenger and How He blesses and uses a messenger is an example to all believers of his goodness and care to all members of his body amen uh that includes you Isaiah 49:16 says behold I have Graven thee upon the palms of my hand thy walls are continually before me so we see the Seven Stars but you're included in that that's why it's important to have a messenger to each age because that connects us to that star everybody with me that star is the connection follow the star you ought to write a song about that out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword Hebrews 4:12 for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to dividing a sunnd of Soul and Spirit and of the joints and Marrow and discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart now we saw that more in this age than every other age ever saw that was recorded right Revelations 19:11 says and I saw heaven open and behold a White Horse He that sat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he do judge and make war his eyes were as flame of fire that's kind of familiar same guy and his head was many on his head were many crowns what you you and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God and the armies which were in heaven followed him who is that us upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword that with it he should Smite the Nations or judge the Nations cuz he will rule them with a rod of iron in the Millennium we know one thing for sure that's the son of David he'll Ru Rule and Reign Over The 12 Tribes of Israel where's the queen where's the queen sitting right there beside him and he treaded The Wine Press of the wide press of the fierceness and Wrath of almighty God and he hath on his vesture in his thigh a name written king of kings and Lord of lords we know that's all capital letters but do you know that he is revealing the heart secrets of men and women in this age in which we are living do you know that I'm asking you that do you know that he's revealing like I said before whatever you got inside of you folks it's going to come out hide it as long as you want to it will show now in the end time it has to cuz it's fullness you can't hide from it there's not a dark space over here there a question mark no it's all been full right so you're going to have to let out what you got inside of you you may be like a pressure cooker have to let it off all at one time good or bad who else could reveal the secrets of the heart but the word himself not a person person the word does it the word right now today you you you we're thinking of Judge every time a sermon comes are you ready you're judged you either come in Better or Worse go out worse why because you've judged what you've not maybe so much what you've done the week before cuz we've all done stuff but in the heart the secrets of the heart the inside of you I I well I'm living it but but I I mean I'm I'm showing it outside but I just really don't know about you know this long hair thing I think I'll just trim it this way a little bit or I think I'll well what what what hurts just a little bit of of pain on the old barn um or whatever daddy used to say but it's same still the same old barn but you know no you're dabbling around with the Devil the devil not God the devil amen right right and remember if you don't know it the devil owns the fence you're sitting on that's right but who else could reveal the secrets of the heart but the word himself Hebrews 4 and12 and he reads the same thing I did it is the word it is performing where look unto it was sent listen this message was sure it was broadcast over the world but it wasn't sent to the world that's right right it was sent to me and you it was sent to his bride that would hear it was sent for it the word is full of power it is the same spirit that was in Jesus the word that is present again in the church in this last age as a last sign trying to head the people off from judgment for they that reject him the word are now already coming to judgment so that's why you got the judge standing there in the seven Church ages right crucifying him aresh number seven that will be done right here his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength all right Matthew 17 verse1 says after six days Jesus taketh Peter James and John his brother and bringeth them up into a high mountain and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun we see his characteristics on Earth his face did shine as the sun and his reignment was white as the light Exodus 34:35 and the children of Israel saw the face of Moses that the skin of Moses's face Shone wow and he wasn't even born again he wasn't a church age messenger either he was a prophet oh no doubt he wrote as Paul as Paul wrote most of the old New Testament he wrote most of the new I mean the old but the skin of Moses face Shone and Moses put the veil upon his face again until he went in to speak with God in other words the people couldn't even look at Moses's face right now let's take that times 10,000 time 10,000 with the fire of God inside of us the bride for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven Malachi four we're heading toward five and all the proud ye all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up say the Lord of hosts that it shall lead them neither root nor Branch but unto you that fear my name the sun's not going to bother you right the fiery wrath of God will not bother you because if you'll realize what I'm telling you today you are the fire of God you are the eyes of God you are the two-edged sword you are all these characteristics that John saw the son of man standing in the midst of the church ages and he giv seven things that he saw and seven I don't where they get that word from that letter from but to you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and you shall go forth and grow up grow up as calves of the stall everybody starts as a calf right now listen to this prove my point then we'll close musicians get ready to come Revelations 21 getting toward the end of the Bible here and there came unto me one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vows full of the seven last plagues and T with me saying come hither now watch come hither I will show Thee the bride so whatever's fixing to come into view right here it has to do with the bride everybody with me the Lamb's wife H and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me that great City the holy Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from God who is that the bride having the glory of God in her light this city has turned into a her and her life was lik UN to a stone most precious look even like a jasper stone clears Crystal reflecting the light revelation 21:21 and the 12 gates were 12 pearls every several gate was of one Pearl and the street of the city was pure gold as it were transparent glass now remember this city what kind of shape is this city in a prism a pyramid so that it can reflect the light cuz watch there's not even going to be a sun in the city if there is a sun it's going to be outside and we brighter than it cuz watch and I saw no Temple therein for the Lord God Almighty and the lamb are the Temple of it and the city had no need of the sun praise God neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of God now who is that who is God's glory you and I are we're the glory of God for the glory of God did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof and the nations of them which are saved now look not filled with the Holy Ghost but saved remember nobody lives in that City I'm just talking about but the bride the ones in the seven Church ages that got the Holy Ghost down here before they died that accepted the messenger for their age got in the message of their hour and was filled with the Holy Ghost are born again right we live in the city billions upon billions will live outside the city foolish virgin cup of water in my name Old Testament Saints a lot of them hello somebody come on and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in that light they'll say how' you get that light why are you going Regina why are you going and I'm not I come into the city I get to walk around I get to look but I got to leave if I'm not not bride I got to leave I got to go back out and get in this other light s n you are the s o n how are you glowing and when we walk out of the city I just that light goes with us cuz it's never going to be Darkness read the read we'll read finish right here and the Gate of it shall not be shut let's stand our feet come on and the Gate of it shall be shut not be shut all day for there shall be no night there we'll finish up right here and we'll we'll start next Sunday no the next Sunday and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive forever more amen and I have the keys of hell and of death John I got this thing covered but I'm going to do it through a bride write the things which thou has seen and the things which are and the things which shall be Hereafter The Mystery of the Seven Stars which thou sawest in your in my right hand and the Seven golden candlesticks the Seven Stars are the Angels of the seven churches and the Seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches you are the light we walk in the light what the Beautiful life where's it coming from inside of you you don't need an external we won't need light in the city we will be the glow to that City what's inside of you right now folks I'm telling you if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost you got something inside of you brighter than any sun that ever shined out there you got something inside of you brighter than any flash of light electricity lightning even an atomic explosion atomic bomb cuz there's a flash of light that'll almost blind you that ain't a dropping a bucket to what you got inside of you that's right so let's live it let's let it out let's let it show to the world hey let's let it show to each other ye are the light of the world and in you there is no Darkness at all the only thing we got to do is is head toward a body change head toward that body change cuz this is not light yet this this is what keeps us all together this is what's keeping us here actually is our spirit and our body right cuz our Soul's already raptured sitting in Heavenly places we just got to catch up but let that light out God bless you seven things that the world may read that and say oh that's Jesus over here and he's just a angry old God angry old Jesus flame of fire and sword and feet of brass no it's you right it's you he's transferred that or imorph every bit of that into you because when John turned to look I'm sure John turned and thought he was going to see him cuz he knew the voice and when I turned to see The Voice he saw seven golden candlesticks right John surely got a revelation a little bit of a revelation that um this man that I talked to you know several years ago on Earth called Jesus he a little different now his eyes are a flame of fire he's got the vesture up here he's got all these things and and and now he's telling me to take every bit of this write it down and give it to seven Church ages seven men and brother B identified all seven we know who they are but it wasn't just a Messengers that God was holding in his hand it was me and you you become the message you believe what the messenger brought but you become the message by the word that's being preached for your hour I believe that amen let's sing a song

words than a brother praying for a sister CU we can't enter into what they're going through we can't enter into that but they can cuz you know what I'm sorry but they're wired a little different than we are emotion and things like that it it it it it clouds our sometimes our judgment it clouds us up a little bit but but deny that if it's bad pray for it's good if it's bad Praise Him for us good so let's bow our heads and pray and you pray Earnest that God will move on this situation dear heavenly father Lord we you spoke your word today father now I pray that you'll come and without anointing you'll transfer it over into the prayer part of the service Lord and and anoint us all Lord the whole building Lord as we speak the word out of our mouth Lord may it come as that two-edged sword May the eyes of fire come through Lord and and show the devil who's the boss it's not us and our Humanity but it's you God that have come into this bride in the end time in the fullness that you can look through our eyes that you can speak through our lips that you can hear through our ears that when our hands move your hands move Lord I pray that you'll move on this situation father and that you'll bless each one that's up here I know all the sisters are here now I pray Lord anything going on in their life Lord I pray that you'd bless them Lord and raise them up for your honor and Glory this is all being done Lord we're all feminist in the body we all got things in the body of Christ that we have to go through but Lord today in the name of the Lord Jesus I pray that you would just anoint these sisters Lord anoint the brothers Lord to pray the prayer of faith and it's the right word to be said is had it right said the right thing she said that ain't nothing but the truth so Lord may we say what you said today ain't nothing but the truth cuz you said it about your bride you said it about the the lovely one the one that that you're going to be with for an eternity father you're waiting on that time for us to come to that Lord between then and now Lord we still got battles we still got mountains but you told us to believe and Lord even when one grain of sand trickles off of that mountain father that's you moving Lord I pray that you would move on every situation here Lord and that by your grace that we'll learn to handle these situations and Lord come out on the other side with our hands lifted up and say thank you Lord thank you Father that you've let me go through this but you brought me through the other side Lord Lord there's a victory take control through you I feel in every battle through you there's a victory if we'll just take that part that you said by your stripes were healed everything that we have need of brother R said it was in the atonement everything was in the atonement and Lord we plead that blood that atonement Lord and we we're doing that now as the Bride of Jesus Christ cuz you told us a prophet that we are the blood by the spirit of God so Lord there had to be someone lay a hand on or or something like that that's okay but father we need to believe as Gentiles and not even have our hands laid on each other but father as a connection Lord we we pray that you'd touch our sisters Lord as they lay their hands on each other and on on sister Dale Lord that you would strengthen each one of them Father give them something Lord from you father we pray Lord in the Stillness of the night you'd come to us and say what all is well all is well we have heard the message Shalom and all is well you spoke to us through a prophet and told us we could do this so by the power of the word of God in this bride in the end time we rebuke the devil for any situation that's going on Lord we pray that you'd touch each one father and Lord may we realize it's you the whole time father it's you but you said you would be with us and even in us so the continuation of your work comes right on into the bride and Lord I pray that we'll realize who we are and what we're doing here we'll realize that we're not a second person of a trinity we'll realize that were you made manifest in another form called a bride on the earth that gives us power as you had power Romans 8 says the same spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you it'll Quicken your mortal body so Lord that same Spirit if we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in our soul that same Spirit dwells inside of us Lord and it'll raise us up not only uh physically but Lord it'll raise us up spiritually and I pray Lord that spiritually we'll all be raised up today that we'll all actually come up a little bit higher he says come up come up hither let me show you things to come father we've done that as a bride I pray now that you just bless us as a church father as a family that you'll be with us now in the furtherment of this time that we have here on Earth father I pray that you'd bless and be with us be with the Roberts family there in uh in Tennessee father and and sister Nicole and the kids Lord I pray that you'd minister to them too while we're praying father that that would be something that would be it would be hard as a human to take but Lord you know all things and you have all things in your hands father I pray now that you'd bless each one truly give us this day Lord our daily bread and forgive us of our trespasses if we forgive those as we forgive those who trespass against us lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and what is the kingdom of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost in a group of Believers and Lord we can even by eyes of Faith see as John saw that City so illuminated till thousands and thousands of miles away it can be seen and it's your bride we pray Lord now that you minister to us Lord take care of every situation that we're praying for Lord we ask for strength and stability in the name of Jesus Christ amen can we sing um let's sing the um we have heard him all as well thank you Lord all is well sing it to him is we have heard messom and all what is it that there is a of perfect rest behind the [Music] in so rest little bright rest for all is sing it to him [Music] again all is is his well we have heard this message Shalom is there is a place of per behind the in ve so rest little bride rest for all is well listen believe what God's already done believe what he's already done you said I don't see anything did he ask you to see it he asked you to believe it he didn't ask Abraham you see that baby no but Abraham you believe what I said yes sir I believe what you said and then in Abraham Abraham started seeing the baby God already knew it was coming why he's God but he wanted Abraham to get in the place to where Abraham brother Bram said go get to Buddha and get the get the uh pins and the diapers get all that ready and and let's go to Walmart we're having a baby that didn't bother him any circumstances didn't bother that's why Abraham listen Abraham did a lot of bad things but he was the father of our faith cuz he kept going he kept going he kept going he kept persevering till one day what happened he met God in human flesh I guarantee you today folks if we meet God in human flesh in this hour it's the son of man and it's in the group of people it's not one man it's not a oneman message anymore this is a collective body fingers hands toes arms torso everything everybody with me not a one man we ain't got to go migrate to some place to hear one person and one person only right we listen to what the spirit says we'll read it to what to the churches he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches God bless you we love you with the love of the Lord Brother Ben God bless you buddy good for

judge remember if we can't judge here we can't judge there that's why when we take communion it says when you judge you judge yourself if you judge yourself you won't be judged do y'all remember what that says if you're judged here you won't be judged there we're our judgment comes right here that's why we can stand in that symbolism of just like the son of man cuz we take our judgment down here they'll see him remember every eye will see him that won't be us that'll be the ones that's turned him down they'll see him and they'll see him in judgment and they'll know that God came in human flesh but came in yours he came in Martin Luther he came in John Wesley and all the different ones and all the ones in during that age it's not just Martin Luther but it's millions of people came out under his message like brother brandham millions of people came out under his message let's sing this one more time before we go all is [Laughter] [Music] well sing out to him as you go as you dismiss
