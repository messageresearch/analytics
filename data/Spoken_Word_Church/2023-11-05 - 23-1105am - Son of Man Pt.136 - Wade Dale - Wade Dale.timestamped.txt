[15:02] day thank you for your presence Lord
[15:04] that we we felt during the song service
[15:06] now Lord I pray that you would sanctify
[15:08] us all Lord the hearers and the speakers
[15:11] be with the sick ones ones that are not
[15:13] here Lord we ask you be with the
[15:15] missionaries on the Foreign Fields be
[15:17] with the ones Lord that are that can't
[15:19] get out Lord that are watching in online
[15:21] Lord I pray that You' give them a
[15:23] special anointing also I know they want
[15:25] to be here Lord but sometimes in the
[15:27] body Lord we have things that bother us
[15:30] Lord and I pray that you'd just help
[15:31] each one father just be with us now in
[15:33] the furth of this service sanctify us
[15:36] for this journey forgive us of our many
[15:37] faults and mistakes that we make Lord
[15:39] may we sit down just a few minutes and
[15:41] hear from you in Jesus name we pray amen
[15:45] we're on part 136 in the beginning was
[15:47] the word word was with God and the Word
[15:49] was God and the word I know y'all can't
[15:52] read
[15:53] that sorry I'm trying to hurry up it
[15:55] took too much time and the Word was made
[15:57] flesh and dwelt Among Us
[16:01] that
[16:02] better wait a minute that's
[16:06] better and the Word was made flesh and
[16:08] dwelt among us and we what we beheld his
[16:11] glory the glory of the only begotten of
[16:13] the father full of grace and truth John
[16:15] 16:12 says I have yet many things to say
[16:18] unto you but you cannot bear them now
[16:20] how be how be it when he the spirit of
[16:23] Truth as like brother uh Vernon was
[16:25] talking about this past weekend the
[16:27] continuity of the word it just continues
[16:29] to carry on it doesn't have to carry on
[16:31] in one vessel it carry on in in several
[16:33] different vessels Jesus knew he was
[16:35] leaving he knew that they weren't
[16:37] understanding what he was saying but he
[16:39] knew that when the spirit of Truth come
[16:41] and would enter them on the day of
[16:42] Pentecost that Peter James and John
[16:45] would be the spokesman then it would go
[16:46] to Paul then it would go to arenus and
[16:48] continue to this day right here all
[16:51] right this is Jesus speaking how be it
[16:54] when he the spirit of Truth what he the
[16:56] Holy Ghost is come he will guide you you
[16:58] into all Truth for he shall not speak of
[17:01] himself but whatsoever he shall hear
[17:03] that shall he speak remember he's
[17:04] talking through the bride and to the
[17:06] bride and he will show you things to
[17:09] come you may be seed he'll show you
[17:10] Revelation that's what we're looking for
[17:12] revelation we live on Revelation we
[17:14] thrive on Revelation and even your new
[17:17] birth is a revelation all right so we're
[17:20] looking at the
[17:21] Revelation that we are the sons and
[17:23] daughters of God all right now we know
[17:26] we can go into before the foundation of
[17:27] the world and all that which is fine but
[17:30] that's in the mind of God we're right
[17:31] here today in flesh we're human beings
[17:33] and if we're not born again we're lost
[17:35] there's not in between okay all right so
[17:38] brother bam says when you must be born
[17:39] again said you're still what you were
[17:41] until you're actually born again of the
[17:42] spirit of God in other words those
[17:44] Creeds doesn't change you as brother Bob
[17:48] said you know somebody saying that you
[17:49] need to go to church that's not going to
[17:51] change
[17:52] anybody cuz the same people keep keep
[17:54] staying out so so it's got to be God get
[17:57] a hold of you
[17:59] so I pray that God gets a hold of all of
[18:00] us today that he gets a hold of all of
[18:03] us and he does a work and he will
[18:06] convict us and when he convicts us you
[18:08] remember at your new birth the preacher
[18:10] didn't convict you the Holy Ghost
[18:13] convicted you and brought you to the
[18:16] altar you say oh well it was through a
[18:18] vessel sure it was through a vessel of
[18:20] preaching and a vessel of bringing the
[18:22] anointing down and and a vessel of
[18:24] opening up and saying hey you need to be
[18:26] born again but it wasn't that preacher's
[18:28] voice that bed you it was God inside of
[18:30] you is what bed you amen when he said
[18:33] you're a child of mine I can tell you
[18:35] that all I want to but that's not going
[18:37] to do you any good your mama your daddy
[18:38] your preacher everybody anybody can say
[18:40] yeah you're a child of God but until God
[18:42] says you're a child of
[18:44] God secondhand
[18:46] information and it can be
[18:49] wrong but not from God it's not so the
[18:52] new birth is an experience something
[18:54] that takes place or something that we go
[18:56] through that we understand in this
[18:58] church it's justification sanctification
[19:00] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost brings
[19:02] you to the New Birth because you can and
[19:05] and yesterday I was thinking about
[19:07] something going on in the world and all
[19:09] and I thought Lord you know that's no it
[19:11] was it was this morning I was thinking
[19:13] about and it was anointed ones and
[19:15] they're they're Anointed with the true
[19:16] Holy
[19:18] Ghost it's not the the Holy Ghost is not
[19:20] false never has been never will be but
[19:23] it can anoint you and your faults that's
[19:28] what we're living under now but if you
[19:30] get the new birth in your soul the Holy
[19:32] Ghost can't
[19:33] be leading you and you be false that's
[19:36] right it's truth and truth amen all
[19:40] right mechanics Dynamics they all got to
[19:43] come together you got to have two pieces
[19:45] to vulcanize you got to have two pieces
[19:47] of rubber to vulcanize all right so the
[19:50] new birth is an experience something
[19:52] that takes place so it's not that thing
[19:54] that brings the new birth in other words
[19:56] come to church and and the DS and don'ts
[19:58] that we talk about all the time it's
[20:01] what I tell you one brother said he and
[20:02] he's just plain as he could be he said
[20:04] you will not have to tell a holy ghost
[20:07] filed person to go to church you're not
[20:09] preaching the Holy Ghost filed
[20:11] people that they don't go to church they
[20:14] just ain't got the Holy
[20:16] Ghost you be quiet if you want to but
[20:18] this the truth how in the world you
[20:20] going to sit home and the Holy Ghost
[20:22] Inside of You says I got to go hear
[20:24] what's going on and be among a brother
[20:27] and sister and be and be in a fellowship
[20:29] and be in a assemble yourself together
[20:32] all right and we can make all kind of
[20:34] excuses but there is
[20:37] none now brother Brown tells us he says
[20:40] I hope the church and we'll talk about
[20:42] this a little more this
[20:44] afternoon because the the Bible tells us
[20:47] that he is the head of the body of the
[20:49] church yes all right well now that has
[20:52] to be separated because not all church
[20:55] is church that's right not all church is
[20:57] bride
[20:58] that's come
[21:00] on but but we had a Prophet come in the
[21:03] end time to what rightly divide the word
[21:05] of Truth this is truth this is error
[21:09] this is the church this is the bride he
[21:11] separated them out all right because
[21:14] what the word is a discerner of the
[21:16] thoughts and intents of the heart just
[21:17] like brother R could stand and say
[21:18] you're from so and so place and you
[21:20] drive a red car and you I mean he the
[21:23] doctor had on a red coat I mean he just
[21:25] was so vivid why cuz it was a vision
[21:27] yeah he was watching
[21:29] television all right he was watching
[21:32] what was going on and that was because
[21:34] the word of God had come to a prophet
[21:36] and had opened up that Dimension well I
[21:39] pray to God that God opens up a
[21:40] dimension in our life today not so much
[21:43] that I got to see what's in your life or
[21:45] what's in my life that will determine
[21:47] itself like brother Bob was talking
[21:49] about keep watching the life keep
[21:51] watching what it produces all right now
[21:54] we have our ups and downs and we can be
[21:55] critical and non-critical but let's just
[21:57] what consider the end of your
[22:00] conversation Jesus Christ the same
[22:02] yesterday today and forever so now we
[22:05] see a church we we keep reading in the
[22:07] Bible about a church but there's a
[22:08] prophet came in the end time he said now
[22:10] I'm going to call you Bride on the first
[22:12] seal when that first seal is getting
[22:14] ready to open he sees where the white
[22:15] horse rider is he sees it's in the
[22:17] church huh he sees it's in the church
[22:21] but he also sees it riding away from him
[22:25] in his Revelation the white horse rider
[22:27] he said here stands Lam and there goes a
[22:28] white horse rider well what was riding
[22:31] off the pretense of the church the
[22:34] falseness of that
[22:36] denominational cuz he stands there one
[22:38] day and he says now I know why I hate
[22:41] denominations cuz it's a nicad and
[22:44] spirit and God hates nickeled and spirit
[22:45] so do we all right you know
[22:48] denominational ideas can be can come in
[22:50] many forms you can't say well the
[22:52] Baptist and the Methodist and the
[22:54] Pentecostal all right look at some of
[22:57] their Tendencies and you see some of the
[22:59] Tendencies trying to creep back in
[23:02] church I'm going to preach
[23:04] anyway but it has we sit we listen and
[23:08] we go home and we just keep going over
[23:10] and over again and we bind the church we
[23:14] bind the spirit of the church by the way
[23:15] we act and
[23:18] think but there's a
[23:20] bride and she's without spot or wrinkle
[23:23] she's going to be perfect she's
[23:26] righteous just as righteous as he is so
[23:30] never since Jesus Christ was on this
[23:32] Earth has Satan had such a formidable
[23:33] opponent he doesn't know what to do with
[23:36] us now there's times when he does oh
[23:39] yeah hey reach take your finger and
[23:43] pinch yourself right here oh okay the
[23:45] devil just pinched you on the
[23:49] hand but he he's got a formidable
[23:52] opponent inside and now we're trying to
[23:54] work that thing out to where the
[23:56] Cornerstone can become the head Stone
[23:58] not just in a building but in you we're
[24:01] talking about me and you we're not
[24:02] talking about the world we I wish that
[24:04] I'm like I'm like the Lord I wish that
[24:07] all would be saved don't you look at
[24:09] people and say oh man if you could just
[24:11] get saved just just get
[24:14] salvation but God knows it will he knows
[24:18] he won't you just got to present it to
[24:20] him number one in what in your
[24:23] life on 1965 brother Brown on rise in
[24:26] the sun he said there has been churches
[24:27] churches Brides brides there has been
[24:29] Brides there been bride listen Jesus
[24:33] Jehovah was married to the Old Testament
[24:36] Jews and we're going to read something
[24:38] here in just a few minutes where Jesus
[24:39] stands one day and he says you had all
[24:43] this The Headstone is here you rejected
[24:46] it but I'm going to give it to a
[24:49] nation that will receive it and that's
[24:52] us the Gentiles he took it from the Jews
[24:54] and give it to
[24:55] us praise God we'll read it in a minute
[24:58] where Jesus was standing there telling
[25:00] them in other words I was married to you
[25:03] remember we read it long when we first
[25:04] got started he says I was married to you
[25:07] but you went whing in other words what
[25:09] you took a horse forehead or you took a
[25:11] denominational idea contrary to the word
[25:14] of God all right that's right you know
[25:17] people try to sit in church and bind
[25:18] church that's a denominational Spirit
[25:21] right when you bind the freedom of the
[25:24] ministry you are you have a
[25:26] denominational spirit all right we need
[25:29] to get rid of that but look brother said
[25:32] but there's got to come one so he's
[25:33] honing it down just like that thing is
[25:35] being
[25:36] honed in me and you the prophet of God
[25:39] is honing it down he's a he's a master
[25:41] builder remember he types zerubabel in
[25:44] the Bible about building and all those
[25:46] things he was a master builder Elijah
[25:49] Elijah was a builder remember they
[25:51] destroyed the whole they destroyed the
[25:53] whole Tabernacle well not the Tabernacle
[25:55] but the altar he put them all back to
[25:57] together then that's when the fire fell
[26:00] all right but it's got to come one
[26:02] Hallelujah there's got to come a real
[26:04] bride so then you've got now a false
[26:07] bride and a real
[26:09] bride cuz you're going to have to have
[26:11] Satan's
[26:13] bride oh he's got a bride yeah he just
[26:18] don't know how to get her to do things
[26:19] do things like he wants him done bless
[26:23] his
[26:26] heart is listen if you'll just break it
[26:30] all down he has no control over
[26:33] nothing nothing we listen what's our
[26:35] greatest Mountain what's our greatest
[26:37] fear
[26:39] death God
[26:42] allows you to die when he allows you to
[26:45] die not when Satan says no I think I'm
[26:47] going to take him today no God said no
[26:49] hang on minute right no not today not I
[26:53] have a plan I have a purpose amen I have
[26:57] something to to do with my children and
[26:59] then maybe I'm going to take them home
[27:01] see that's the way I see it and I I've
[27:03] said it in many funerals same way with
[27:05] if you're a holy ghost filled person
[27:06] today I don't believe the death angel
[27:08] comes and picks you
[27:10] up that's a death
[27:13] angel oh well brother we die no the
[27:16] Bible says no Christians can't die they
[27:18] don't die they just move into another
[27:20] place I like what brother Donnie Reagan
[27:23] you know he lost his daughter a couple
[27:24] weeks ago and he preached one sermon
[27:26] called why which was wonderful and then
[27:29] he preached last week about an update on
[27:33] Erica which is his daughter that passed
[27:35] away he said I W to let you know since
[27:37] she's moved on so you can think about
[27:41] what what went on in the sermon she's
[27:43] moved she's she's gone to another place
[27:46] and it was wonderful you ought to go see
[27:47] it sometime he is a good Minister but
[27:50] there must come one that not only got
[27:52] the mechanics but the Dynamics makes the
[27:54] church live move in the power of
[27:56] Resurrection until we come to that place
[27:58] look till we come to that place what
[28:01] good is it to polish the hubs all right
[28:03] what good is it to make that car look
[28:05] good if it ain't got anything in it to
[28:06] drive it all right so Hebrews 4:12 the
[28:10] Bible says for the word of God is quick
[28:12] and powerful and sharper than any
[28:13] two-edged sword so the word of God is
[28:15] what's going to loose us yes from our
[28:19] sins or loose us from our ideas and from
[28:21] our thoughts that's why the word of God
[28:24] has been disrespected and put out of the
[28:27] denomination AAL World they don't want
[28:28] God remember he's outside trying to get
[28:30] in
[28:32] absolutely huh amen that's what it says
[28:35] in our church age behold I stand at to
[28:38] what door and
[28:40] knock and if anyone will let me in in
[28:42] other words there got to be somebody on
[28:44] this side of the door and many people
[28:46] will not reach and get the door knob and
[28:48] let him
[28:49] in but we have praise
[28:52] God we have made we have been made an
[28:55] given an entrance as we were talking
[28:56] about the other day an Open Door yes
[28:59] it's all open now there's nothing hid
[29:01] everything's out in the
[29:03] open piercing even to the dividing of
[29:06] under of Soul and Spirit we see where
[29:08] the prophet of God was the only one that
[29:10] could pull that thing apart and show us
[29:12] because it was a mind of God yes God
[29:15] wanted it because this was the Bible
[29:16] That's right The Bible had to be
[29:18] fulfilled he had to tell us there's
[29:20] going to be a true bride he had to tell
[29:22] us that the church was over here and the
[29:24] bride was over here he had to tell us
[29:26] that he's going to send the word of God
[29:28] to do something not just say well I'm
[29:30] right and you're wrong no that ain't
[29:33] it that's not
[29:36] it it's piercing even to the dividing
[29:39] aund of Soul and Spirit and join in
[29:42] Marrow your your flesh and is's a
[29:45] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[29:46] the heart so we looked at the soul of
[29:49] man the soul of man today is if you're
[29:51] sitting here today it's the real you it
[29:54] it's the part of you that that most
[29:56] people can't that nobody can see except
[29:58] what you display
[30:00] amen you can hide things you can put
[30:03] things over here you can hide this you
[30:05] can hide this but that soul is what's
[30:07] going to stand at the day of judgment if
[30:09] you have to stand at the day of judgment
[30:11] that soul of you is going to stand at
[30:12] the day of
[30:13] judgment now you're going to take your
[30:15] spirit and your flesh with you cuz
[30:18] you're one unit everybody with
[30:20] me but if you got the soul of almighty
[30:23] God how you going to be judged that's
[30:25] right how you going you're stand in your
[30:27] judgement now we have as brother Bob was
[30:30] talking about we have separated oursel
[30:32] the Holy Ghost has separated us and
[30:34] asked us and and and not ask us and
[30:36] probably I don't say demand but he loves
[30:39] for us to live a separated life sir Amen
[30:42] to where when we walk down the road they
[30:44] say and usually the world says what's
[30:46] wrong with that PE that person we want
[30:48] to say what's right about it but they
[30:50] want to say what's wrong with that
[30:51] person what's wrong with that sister oh
[30:53] look look old with her hair long and hey
[30:56] you know what
[30:58] God loves it if God loves it I love it
[31:01] all right so your soul today is either
[31:03] Faith or doubt you're either born again
[31:05] or you're not born again everybody with
[31:07] me all right the spirit realm though has
[31:09] five senses memory reasoning conscious
[31:12] effects and Imagination that's where we
[31:13] have our problem that's right right even
[31:16] though your soul as we were talking not
[31:19] too long ago you know if you're born
[31:21] again today your soul don't sin
[31:24] absolutely that's right so the real you
[31:28] doesn't sin but you see how strong that
[31:31] sin was in the garden from the memory
[31:34] reason conscious affection imagination
[31:36] and then out into your flesh you see how
[31:38] God had to separate that
[31:41] thing but then he brings it back
[31:43] together and he says the soul that sinth
[31:45] will surely die that's right not this
[31:49] the soul that sinth shall surely die not
[31:52] the spirit the
[31:54] soul God said All Souls are mine he
[31:56] gives them he takes takes them away he's
[31:58] the only one that can't Satan can't
[31:59] create he can't take them away God's the
[32:02] only one that can do
[32:03] it praise God we serve a God that's in
[32:06] control yes sir whether we think he's
[32:08] out of we're out of control we praise
[32:10] God we have a God that's totally in
[32:13] control of everything and sure we can
[32:15] ask why as brother Donnie said and I was
[32:17] preaching the other Wednesday night on
[32:18] on you know questioning God and
[32:20] questioning what's going on and we saw
[32:22] that a prophet questioned God and got in
[32:24] trouble for doing that but the
[32:26] Providence of God we know one thing for
[32:29] sure he cannot make a mistake any move
[32:31] he makes is the right
[32:33] move right so we must accept that yes we
[32:37] must accept that and move on instead of
[32:39] having a pity
[32:40] party yes sir listen we've had I was
[32:43] looking at the the 40th anniversary
[32:46] picture in there on the St in the study
[32:48] and there's six people now there's more
[32:51] than that that's left the church but
[32:52] there's six people that's physically
[32:54] passed away that went to this went been
[32:55] to this church since the 40th
[32:58] anniversary six people passed away moved
[33:01] over in you know they don't live here
[33:02] any more right they live over another
[33:04] dimension but you know what what took
[33:06] them over there was what they heard
[33:10] here and what they took in that's why
[33:13] church is important what you take in is
[33:15] what you're going to take over there
[33:16] that's right if you got an animosity to
[33:18] a brother you're not going to take it
[33:19] over there you might go over in another
[33:21] place over here but you're not going to
[33:22] go in that
[33:24] place cuz that's where your soul goes
[33:28] yes anybody with me that's how how
[33:31] hideous sin was when God had to separate
[33:34] that thing he said I'll put enmity I'm
[33:37] going to put a division between I can't
[33:39] even stand to see what y'all did but I'm
[33:42] going to make a
[33:45] provision I'm going to take a
[33:48] lamb I'm gonna kill it
[33:50] myself yeah God killed a lamb what do
[33:53] you think who do you think did that in
[33:54] the Bible Well your God don't have hands
[33:57] come on my God's a human if you don't if
[33:59] you don't mind me saying he's not a
[34:00] cloud he's not a spook he's not Casper
[34:02] the Friendly Ghost he's a man and he's
[34:05] way more real than we are and he's way
[34:06] more solid than we are sir and way more
[34:11] intelligent than we are so let's trust
[34:13] in what he's done listen as brother
[34:16] Ernie vill W always said he said you got
[34:18] to plug yourself into the
[34:20] Eternal if you're born again today you
[34:22] are plugged into that Eternal and you
[34:24] can't be unplugged right
[34:27] but you got when you get plugged in you
[34:29] got to do what the current
[34:32] says turn the light on yes sir Ephesians
[34:36] 1 ver4 says according as he has chosen
[34:38] us we're going to read this this
[34:40] afternoon a little bit different
[34:42] according as he has chosen Us in him
[34:44] before the foundation of the world so in
[34:45] the mind of God we were chosen of God we
[34:48] were perfected in
[34:51] God that Genesis 126 man never sined
[34:54] right that's why when it comes to you
[34:56] it's a new New Birth it burns all that
[34:57] out and you don't have to stand judgment
[35:00] you don't have to stand you don't have
[35:01] to stand at the Judgment bar praise God
[35:04] that's scared people to death I heard a
[35:06] guy the other day and he was a
[35:08] denominational guy and he said he said
[35:10] well when I get to judgment I hope I he
[35:12] you know XYZ I thought
[35:14] man I'd leave a denomination that told
[35:17] me I was going to have to go through the
[35:18] tribulation period and go s before the
[35:21] white Throne judgment I'd leave them
[35:23] didn't you sir you're sitting here today
[35:26] you left it because of something must
[35:28] been false
[35:30] Doctrine thank you Lord there's some
[35:33] good people out there but listen that
[35:34] system is rotten God hates that thing
[35:37] all right we don't hate the people but
[35:40] if you attach yourself to it just like
[35:42] if you attach yourself to it then you're
[35:44] part of it so let's be a part of the
[35:46] Eternal we've attached oursel to the
[35:48] Eternal all right having predestinated
[35:51] us into the adoption of children by
[35:53] Jesus Christ where to himself listen if
[35:56] everything we do if we get Jesus Christ
[36:00] does it in himself yes that's where
[36:03] we're perfect that's where we're without
[36:05] spot that's where we're without wrinkle
[36:07] yes sir not in our own righteousness
[36:10] filthy rags you ever took an old filthy
[36:12] rag I found one other day out in the
[36:14] yard oh it was horrible that's my and
[36:16] your righteousness to God but brother
[36:19] John he took that rag yes and one day he
[36:23] cleaned it up he used the bleach of the
[36:25] Holy Ghost and he cleaned that thing up
[36:28] and now they ain't a spot nowhere praise
[36:31] God for
[36:33] thaten sorry I was going to teach a
[36:35] little bit I'm preaching something so
[36:37] but look also we got to remember too
[36:39] that as we go through this uh plan of
[36:42] God we have to know that we have to come
[36:45] to adoption because it's required in
[36:49] this age because look having
[36:51] predestinated us yes predetermined pre
[36:56] amen
[36:57] predestiny
[36:58] determined why could he predestiny
[37:01] determined cuz he saw that there'd be a
[37:03] group of people here and he'd have his
[37:05] word to connect to it yes all right see
[37:08] we got to know that see in Luther's day
[37:10] he connected with the just shall live by
[37:12] faith now he didn't connect with one
[37:14] God he was a
[37:16] trinitarian but we connect to that
[37:21] that's why the prophet of God had to
[37:22] come take all the Loose Ends and bring
[37:24] them back together so having
[37:27] predestinated us so we're predestinated
[37:29] to what not just to get born again but
[37:31] to be adopted yes to be a son and
[37:33] daughter of God that can stand here one
[37:35] day and as we'll read here maybe this
[37:37] afternoon where brother Ram said you
[37:39] pray for the sick now he said you'll
[37:41] command it
[37:44] then what you'll command what yeah but
[37:48] you know what we got to command this guy
[37:51] first this guy is my worst
[37:55] enemy so your adoption is not your birth
[37:58] your adoption is your placing so but
[38:00] you've got to be born again so you can
[38:02] come into the line of adoption because
[38:04] you can't be adopted without being born
[38:06] again all right and what is adoption
[38:08] we'll talk about this afternoon I'll
[38:10] break it all down how it was in the Old
[38:11] Testament and how it is in Israel now
[38:13] called a bar mitzvah and we'll see what
[38:15] that means because we got to talk about
[38:18] the placing your adoption is your
[38:20] placing yes it's not the place you
[38:24] sit okay physically
[38:27] but it's the place that you are at in
[38:29] the word of God it's the place that
[38:31] you're at in
[38:33] maturity or not that's
[38:37] right we've been going to this church a
[38:39] long time L you've been going a long
[38:41] time all your life we've got to come to
[38:44] adoption it's been preached 50 years ago
[38:46] and it's still being preached now we
[38:48] have got to come on speaking terms with
[38:50] God speaking condition with God to where
[38:53] he can use us use a powerful Church they
[38:56] may just be one I contend this is it if
[38:58] not we need to go find
[39:01] it I didn't get many amens out of
[39:05] that but when you're born again of the
[39:09] spirit of God you're son of daughter of
[39:10] God we know that right but we were
[39:13] predestinated all right see he separates
[39:15] it we were predestinated to what to
[39:18] adoption all right God don't want
[39:19] children sure he loved the Pentecostal
[39:22] Babylon babies the ones that spoke in
[39:23] tongues and thought that was the Holy
[39:24] Ghost and they'd have this gift over
[39:26] here and they somebody be even brother R
[39:28] be preaching and somebody jump up
[39:30] speaking tongues that's totally out of
[39:31] order but he allowed it to happen and he
[39:34] kept telling the now he kep kept telling
[39:36] his home church he said hey quit doing
[39:38] that all right right he put everything
[39:40] in order but it was babies and brother
[39:43] Brown knew it was babies he knew he was
[39:45] talking to babies somebody that didn't
[39:46] even know what he was talking about most
[39:48] of the time CU remember we'll read it
[39:51] where he said it's not to you it's not
[39:53] for
[39:54] you so what is AD doop
[39:58] option let's go to Peter because Peter
[40:00] talks about it say if these things be in
[40:02] you and abound what these
[40:05] things be in you and abound in other
[40:07] words you use
[40:10] them I like what brother brother Aaron
[40:12] or somebody he's got a a quote that says
[40:15] if you haven't used anything in seven
[40:16] months or something he said you need to
[40:18] throw it away well if you hadn't used
[40:21] these in seven months you better start
[40:24] you better start praying cuz this is God
[40:26] In Motion this is God using us to do
[40:29] something all right he's trying to get
[40:32] us to listen to what he's
[40:36] saying bre these being in you and abound
[40:38] they make
[40:40] you Peter old rough old Ru Peter the old
[40:44] fisherman Peter Peter said this will
[40:47] make you that you shall neither be Baro
[40:50] and fruitful in the knowledge of Our
[40:51] Lord why we come to church if we don't
[40:53] want to be fruitful why we have
[40:55] Christian if we don't want will become
[40:56] fruitful I think the Bible says show
[40:59] fruit meet for repentance show
[41:03] fruit listen if you're not showing fruit
[41:06] then your Vine got cut down
[41:08] somewhere cuz if you put it in the
[41:09] ground and you give it the right
[41:11] nourishment and you keep it trimmed come
[41:13] on somebody it will produce
[41:17] fruit just a law of it's just a law of
[41:21] production but he that lath these things
[41:23] is blind all right you may be born again
[41:25] but you're blind you the baby right you
[41:27] know BL babies may be able to see but
[41:29] they're
[41:30] blind what are they blind to they're
[41:32] blind to that that's H don't touch it
[41:35] they're blind to that they need to sit
[41:36] right here and if they fall off they're
[41:38] going to hurt their head they're blind
[41:39] to that you might be a Christian and
[41:41] function as a Christian but you can be
[41:43] blind as a
[41:46] b but he that lack these things is blind
[41:48] and cannot see a far off and hath
[41:52] forgotten sometimes we do we
[41:54] forget that we were Pur from these old
[41:57] sins wherefore the rather Brethren give
[42:00] diligence to make your calling and
[42:01] election sure for if you do these things
[42:05] you shall never fall now that's a that's
[42:07] just as much a promise that's thus
[42:08] sayith the Lord amen cuz God wrote it in
[42:11] the Bible right everything is thus
[42:13] sayith the Lord in the Bible sir so
[42:16] through Peter he says you shall never
[42:19] fall amen for so an entrance shall be
[42:22] ministered unto you look that entrance
[42:25] is this message of the
[42:27] hour Lord that entrance is what you
[42:30] stepped into because you opened the door
[42:33] and let Christ
[42:35] in so there's an entrance ministered
[42:37] unto you abundantly in the Everlasting
[42:39] Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[42:40] Christ now that's not a kingdom over
[42:43] there what he say your kingdom is
[42:45] within wherefore I will not be negligent
[42:48] to put you always in Rememberance of
[42:50] these things 136
[42:54] sermons we're all a little slow we're
[42:56] Southerners but we're
[42:57] okay though you know them look though
[43:00] you know them and be established in
[43:01] present day
[43:05] truth so Matthew 17:5 and we know that
[43:09] in the first part of Matthew when Jesus
[43:10] went to the river and was baptized there
[43:13] was a Dove came down and and there was a
[43:15] voice that said this is my beloved Son
[43:17] in whom I pleased to
[43:19] dwell right didn't say here you him at
[43:22] that time he had some growth to do
[43:24] because the Bible says he grew in Grace
[43:25] and knowledge
[43:26] the Bible said he had to have a mountain
[43:30] experience he had to come to
[43:33] adoption so now this is Matthew 17 is's
[43:36] up on top of the mountain Behold The
[43:37] Voice come out of the cloud which said
[43:38] this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleas
[43:40] I'm well pleased hear ye him in other
[43:44] words I have identified where I am well
[43:46] listen God through a prophet identified
[43:49] that his bride is him yes amen not a
[43:52] second person the bride is
[43:55] him
[43:56] the voice of the bride and the voice of
[43:58] the bridegroom is the same if it's not
[44:00] you were out
[44:02] bride because the bridegroom's voice is
[44:04] always going to be the same it's just
[44:07] the bride's voice has got to be the same
[44:09] as the
[44:10] bridegroom Luke 9:33 says it came to
[44:13] pass as they departed from him Peter
[44:16] said unto Jesus Master it is good for us
[44:19] to be here and let us set up a
[44:21] trinitarian
[44:23] Doctrine let make three Tabernacles one
[44:26] for you one for Moses one for Elijah not
[44:29] knowing look not knowing what he said am
[44:32] he got
[44:33] excited he just blurted out that's Peter
[44:36] you
[44:37] know the same guy that wrote about these
[44:41] a little later when he got the Holy
[44:42] Ghost he didn't have the Holy Ghost here
[44:44] while he thus spake God cut him off
[44:48] while he thus spake there came a cloud
[44:49] and overshadow of them and they feared
[44:50] as they entered the cloud and there came
[44:53] a voice out of the cloud saying this is
[44:54] my beloved Son hear him and when the
[44:57] voice was passed Jesus was found alone
[45:01] and they kept it close and told no man
[45:03] in those days any of those things which
[45:06] they had
[45:08] seen brother R did the same
[45:11] thing he went I this is what I
[45:14] believe he went up on the mountain and
[45:17] he was
[45:19] adopted a
[45:21] cloud there was a voice spoke through
[45:23] that cloud said go back to Jefferson
[45:24] Bell amen these seals will be given to
[45:27] you there the seals wern't revealed to
[45:28] him in Tucson they were revealed to him
[45:31] in Jeffersonville all right he said go
[45:33] back and these things will be made known
[45:35] to you to me that's when I believe that
[45:38] brother Brandon was adopted and then he
[45:40] said hear ye him because listen then
[45:43] then why not will you say well how can
[45:44] you establish that how many people
[45:46] preached the truth of the seals in
[45:51] 1963 that's what I thought nobody oh
[45:54] Clarence Larin they said clar you see
[45:56] that they got that junk on online now
[45:58] where where brother Brown stole it from
[46:00] Clarence
[46:02] Lin Clarence Lin might have been a good
[46:04] man he might have been a holy ghost fi
[46:06] preacher but he wasn't a
[46:08] prophet he wasn't an identified Church
[46:10] age messenger in the Bible right and he
[46:14] just preached the seals and then went on
[46:17] brother rown preached the seals and I
[46:18] believe it opened up to us it was for
[46:21] this bride this end time bride not the
[46:24] one back there this one amen cuz he says
[46:27] right here in questions and answers on
[46:28] the seals now this is he's preached
[46:30] first seal second seal third fourth
[46:31] fifth and six seals he's preached six
[46:34] seal he's getting ready to preach the
[46:36] sth that afternoon or that evening all
[46:38] right so he has questions and answers
[46:40] cuz remember always between the 6 and a
[46:42] seven there's an interval we'll preach
[46:43] on that maybe a little bit
[46:47] later I know that you don't see
[46:51] it cuz see there was no one adopted
[46:53] during that time brother R is standing
[46:55] on a level
[46:56] that no one had stood on since that time
[46:59] of
[47:00] Christ everybody with
[47:03] me I'm identifying where God is Not That
[47:07] William Brandon was God no way he is a
[47:09] sinner just like me and you born in sin
[47:11] shapen in iniquity had to be born
[47:14] again but he was a church age messenger
[47:16] he was identified in the Bible and I
[47:18] don't care what man says if the Bible
[47:21] said that's who it was that's good
[47:23] enough for me all right but he said I
[47:26] know that you don't see it I'm just
[47:27] positive you don't see
[47:30] it remember tell this Vision to no one
[47:33] until the son of man be risen again I
[47:34] didn't read that but Jesus said that
[47:36] going down the mountain he look hey
[47:37] don't tell this to nobody until the son
[47:39] of man be risen
[47:41] again well he rose the first time 2,000
[47:44] years ago when's he going to rise again
[47:46] in the end time in a bride The Headstone
[47:50] us as being the collective body brings
[47:54] The Headstone back we'll get into that a
[47:55] little bit
[47:56] later but I'm positive you don't see it
[47:58] you say brother I'm that's a hard thing
[48:00] to say I know it is but look let me just
[48:02] say this now I suppose this is just tape
[48:04] for oursel well it went all over the
[48:06] world but let me say this that you don't
[48:09] get
[48:10] it and you're not supposed to get
[48:15] it and you're not supposed to get it so
[48:17] he's not frustrated sure he's frustrated
[48:19] in his Humanity but it's not frustrated
[48:22] that it's just going to be words just
[48:23] going to be thrown out somewhere he
[48:26] knows it's the word of God the greatest
[48:29] thing since Jesus was on Earth he's
[48:31] fixing to open those seals all right
[48:34] back in now he's preached six of them he
[48:36] sees that it's the greatest Ministry
[48:38] that he' ever had the most anointing
[48:39] he'd ever had and they're just sitting
[48:41] there going can I wear panty
[48:45] hose can I wear pajamas to
[48:48] bed and several of the questions two
[48:50] questions was on the seals the rest of
[48:52] them were not one of them was on water
[48:54] baptism and you know what what brother
[48:56] Ram in his in his in his Humanity he
[48:59] probably was rolling his eyes but in his
[49:01] in his pastoral work as a prophet he
[49:04] answered it just like he answered it 10
[49:06] years ago 20 years ago he answered it he
[49:09] didn't say like some of us ago hey you
[49:11] ought to know this by now no he took it
[49:14] and he answered
[49:16] it about water baptism that he preached
[49:18] for years and years and he answered the
[49:20] question what about water baptism and
[49:22] all the different things that's why he
[49:23] saw that they didn't get it but look he
[49:25] says look and you're not supposed to get
[49:27] it so don't try to interpret it man's
[49:29] tried to do that don't try to put your
[49:31] interpretation to it you only get
[49:33] further away that's what man's done
[49:36] they've got further away from the word
[49:37] of God by not being what in the word for
[49:42] their
[49:43] hour as brother buron was talking about
[49:46] the continuity of the word means that
[49:47] that word is moving and it's moving from
[49:51] from dispensation to dispensation this
[49:53] is now the dispensation get out of here
[49:57] this is a dispensation when The
[49:59] Headstone will speak it will speak
[50:00] through a bride and it will not speak
[50:03] through one
[50:04] person we've had that one person but
[50:07] it'll be a many membered body somebody's
[50:09] going to catch it may not be with three
[50:10] people or four or two but somebody's
[50:15] going to get
[50:16] this take my advice if you believe me
[50:19] now if God has given me favor in your
[50:20] sight you know that them Revelations the
[50:23] things I've been here with you a long
[50:24] time and it's always been right and now
[50:26] to double prove it right it hooks right
[50:28] in with the word so you know it's thus
[50:30] sayith the Lord that's exactly it's
[50:32] proved to you now take my advice as your
[50:35] brother don't put your own
[50:36] interpretation to anything you just go
[50:38] on live a good now he didn't say that
[50:39] weren't
[50:40] Christians he didn't say well bless God
[50:42] you all lost you ain't getting what I'm
[50:44] saying so you're lost no they're
[50:46] Christians they're Christians for a
[50:49] dispensation that the door or the book
[50:52] wasn't open to
[50:54] them HJ don't put your own
[50:56] interpretation to anything you just go
[50:58] on and live a good Christian life cuz
[51:00] you'll only wind yourself away from the
[51:02] real thing when you do so there must be
[51:04] a real
[51:05] thing right and they will wind theirself
[51:08] away from the real thing right you'll
[51:11] only wind your way again away from the
[51:14] thing and all of you are conscious that
[51:16] know that there's something mysterious
[51:18] happening and it's happening and I know
[51:19] what it is in other words the opening of
[51:21] the seals was the Revelation that had
[51:24] been hid since Jesus left the earth now
[51:28] I'm not saying that it's the grace of
[51:30] God that lets me know what it is it's
[51:31] something that's tremendous and it's
[51:33] gone right now and there's no way in the
[51:35] world for you to see it but so help me
[51:37] with this Bible in my hand I know what
[51:39] it is it was for
[51:43] us it was closed to them open to us just
[51:47] like I tell you many times some people
[51:49] man told me one time he said the seven
[51:51] Seal's not open I said okay that's
[51:53] fine to you
[51:56] you to you it may not be open cuz you're
[52:00] confessing that it's not but to me it's
[52:02] open right so the seven seal is not open
[52:05] un Le you understand it
[52:07] amen Hebrews 5:10 called of God and high
[52:10] priest after the order mezic of whom we
[52:12] have many things to say and hard to be
[52:13] uttered seeing you look seeing you're a
[52:15] dull of hearing I read that because
[52:17] that's what brother ran was telling
[52:18] those people you're dull of hearing but
[52:20] this is not for you he's so gracious to
[52:21] say look this is not for you in other
[52:24] words it's is not going to return void
[52:26] though it's going to accomplish there's
[52:27] going to be a
[52:28] generation how many of us were were born
[52:31] in 1963 prior
[52:35] to
[52:37] right it was for
[52:39] us and all y'all just born after if not
[52:43] it would have closed the book The Seal
[52:44] would have open they'd have took a
[52:45] Rapture and we'd have never been here
[52:47] but that's not what God saw before the
[52:49] foundation of the world he saw a group
[52:51] of people that would sit here and even
[52:52] though they sit here and they do this
[52:54] and they theyy try to understand what's
[52:56] going on some of the young ones you're
[52:58] still here yes you're here listening and
[53:02] I believe the spirit speaks to everybody
[53:04] individually at your own
[53:07] level cuz he will not leave you or
[53:10] forsake you so he's going to talk to you
[53:13] in your terms if you'll
[53:15] listen but remember Paul's going to tell
[53:18] us here in a minute for when the time we
[53:21] ought to be teachers we have need that
[53:23] one teach you again the first principles
[53:25] of the Oracles of God in other words
[53:27] what a baptism no eternal hell all these
[53:30] different things but there is time for
[53:32] that and we need a circle back sometime
[53:34] remember I told you the Lord told me a
[53:35] couple years ago that he's not going to
[53:37] leave anybody behind that wants to catch
[53:39] up so this is the catching up time these
[53:42] past two years was a catching up time if
[53:44] you didn't catch up in these last two
[53:45] years then we're heading toward the
[53:47] coming of the Lord so your Gap is a lot
[53:49] close mine too our Gap is a lot closer
[53:53] than it was two years ago right
[53:55] than for when for the time you ought to
[53:57] be teachers you have need that one teach
[53:59] you again who be the first principles
[54:00] the Oracles of God and are become such
[54:02] as have need of milk and not of strong
[54:04] meat in other words he's sitting there
[54:06] looking at adults that should be adults
[54:07] that should be eating meat and they're
[54:09] drinking drinking milk that's what
[54:11] brother randam was doing see Paul and
[54:13] brother randam if you took their
[54:15] life remember I did that years and years
[54:17] and years ago take uh
[54:21] Moses
[54:22] Jesus Paul and brother brandom and you
[54:25] put their lives together and pretty much
[54:28] they're the same amen all right pretty
[54:31] much I said Moses had an experience with
[54:33] a burning bush
[54:35] right Jesus had an
[54:37] experience yes Paul had an experience on
[54:40] the Damascus Road and brother Brown had
[54:42] an experience with a Bo talking to him
[54:44] up in a tree there's a light hanging
[54:46] over him at his
[54:47] birth I just pray there's a light inside
[54:50] of you that can understand
[54:52] it for everyone that uses milk is
[54:55] unskillful now it doesn't say you're
[54:57] lost like I said before he didn't say
[54:59] those people were lost they were
[55:02] unskillful listen to be adopted you have
[55:04] to be
[55:05] skillful cuz you can't say something a
[55:08] Miss because you then you have so much
[55:10] power in your voice power without
[55:13] character it's satanic that's what we've
[55:15] been preaching on the power is there but
[55:19] get everything together before you speak
[55:21] because what you
[55:23] say yeah
[55:27] H for everyone that uses milk is
[55:30] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[55:32] for he's a babe didn't say he wasn't
[55:34] born he was a
[55:36] babe but strong meat belongeth to them
[55:38] that are of full age even those who by
[55:40] reason of
[55:43] use do we use the word of God we're
[55:46] given to its fullest extent I want to
[55:48] ask you that
[55:49] today I
[55:51] don't and that don't mean we have to be
[55:53] God's zombies you understand what I mean
[55:56] we're human
[55:57] beings right we're human beings but we
[56:01] should spend more time with the Lord
[56:02] than we do with Facebook and this book
[56:04] and that book
[56:10] and nothing listen nothing wrong with it
[56:13] if there's nothing wrong with anything
[56:15] hardly if you use it right cuz the
[56:17] communication we all communicate through
[56:19] WhatsApp well you let's throw it away no
[56:21] brother no don't throw it away but don't
[56:24] be sitting there back and forth for
[56:25] three or four hours with each other yeah
[56:27] hello somebody I'm not talking to
[56:28] anybody
[56:34] [Music]
[56:36] here
[56:39] Facebook all those
[56:41] books listen they're here to stay
[56:43] there's nothing you can do about
[56:45] it electronic you listen everybody's
[56:48] going cashless
[56:51] now you better learned how to use a
[56:53] debit card or a credit card
[56:55] cuz the hospital sent us a message the
[56:57] other day that cashless you don't go up
[56:59] there and give them cash no
[57:01] more nope and when you go to a
[57:04] restaurant you pay with cash they look
[57:06] at you
[57:08] crossy what's that it's
[57:12] cash we use it within little cards like
[57:16] this but look by reason of use have
[57:20] their senses exercised to discern both
[57:22] good and evil now what's your senses
[57:23] memory reasoning conscious affection
[57:25] imagination that's your reasoning Factor
[57:28] that's your senses that God works
[57:30] through and Satan Works through both
[57:33] that's the Battleground when brother
[57:35] Brown preached the greatest battle ever
[57:36] fought he wasn't talking about that it
[57:38] was locked up here in your brain no it
[57:40] was the it was you the spirit realm that
[57:42] encompasses your daily Journey if it
[57:45] wasn't for my memory I'd be a lot better
[57:47] off hello
[57:51] somebody but I wasn't conscious of the
[57:53] evil that run through this head of mine
[57:54] and I'm sorry it only happens to me
[58:02] so he said oh don't miss this after that
[58:05] son was adopted see now not before after
[58:09] that son was adopted his name on the
[58:11] checkbook was just as good as his
[58:13] daddy's now when you're born again and
[58:15] you started as a newborn babe God
[58:17] doesn't give you a checkbook Blank
[58:19] That's Right power without character I
[58:22] know you can't bang her up to heaven but
[58:23] you could write some pretty big checks
[58:24] that you really shouldn't have
[58:26] wrote but Power with character God hands
[58:29] you the checkbook and doesn't have any
[58:32] reservation with you using it am you
[58:35] saying my Humanity no your Humanity has

[1:00:17] out we are all the way out yes
[1:00:21] sir if you'll accept
[1:00:23] it

[1:00:31] church just say to this mountain be
[1:00:33] moved and it'll move
[1:00:35] Authority sons of God the whole creation
[1:00:38] is groaning and waiting for the
[1:00:39] manifestation of the sons of God waiting
[1:00:41] to a spot to where that the sickness
[1:00:43] will be a
[1:00:45] arise and it will be that
[1:00:48] way the blind will receive their sight
[1:00:50] deaf and dum we pray for them
[1:00:53] now but then you'll command
[1:00:58] it what you quiet
[1:01:01] for can you not say Amen to
[1:01:06] that don't be don't
[1:01:09] fear I'm no longer a what slave to
[1:01:14] fear I'm a Child of
[1:01:16] God the blind will receive their sight
[1:01:19] deaf and dumb we pray for them now but

[1:01:26] shall cast out devils not I will they
[1:01:29] will if you say to this mountain not if
[1:01:31] I say if you say to this mountain be
[1:01:34] moved and don't doubt in your heart you
[1:01:35] know listen that I know brother Bram
[1:01:37] couldn't have lived this long cuz he'd
[1:01:38] have been like hund and something years
[1:01:40] old but God took him the time he was
[1:01:42] supposed to take him because remember
[1:01:43] God's perfect did somebody say that not
[1:01:45] too long ago God's perfect his timing is
[1:01:47] perfect he took that Prophet off the
[1:01:49] scene because if that Prophet was here
[1:01:50] today guess what we'd
[1:01:52] be we'd be looking at the prophet
[1:01:55] but now we look to Jesus Christ that's
[1:01:58] who he introduced us to John said look
[1:02:01] I'm
[1:02:02] nothing here's the one you need to look
[1:02:05] at like we were talking about the other
[1:02:07] day about church ages in the Old
[1:02:08] Testament John was the last one of the
[1:02:11] church age he was the hinge pin he he
[1:02:13] was the the one that had the Old
[1:02:15] Testament and New Testament John had the
[1:02:17] spirit of Elijah somebody say Amen so
[1:02:20] what did he do he turned her heart back
[1:02:22] and introduced Christ then you start the
[1:02:25] new church ages the church ages in the
[1:02:27] New Testament you go all the way through
[1:02:28] at the very end who shows up Elijah
[1:02:31] shows up again amen and a little Prophet
[1:02:35] that turns us back Hallelujah and says
[1:02:38] that's him
[1:02:40] yes she is but then he brings it all
[1:02:43] back together and he says she is
[1:02:45] him then it's not him over there it's
[1:02:49] him
[1:02:50] here but how can the church the
[1:02:52] Pentecostal church and the Methodist bap
[1:02:54] be adopted until they come to
[1:03:00] discipline we've got to be disciplined
[1:03:04] first God could not trust this power
[1:03:07] with the church it's hard to tell what
[1:03:10] you would do power without character all
[1:03:14] right how could a father trust his
[1:03:16] business to a boy that might simply
[1:03:18] pollute his whole inheritance he
[1:03:20] couldn't do it the church has got to
[1:03:23] come to a place to where it's discipline
[1:03:25] God's on that God's on that work right
[1:03:28] now discipline
[1:03:31] right CU you know listen there's fathers
[1:03:35] can turn their businesses over to sons
[1:03:37] and if you look in the world usually
[1:03:39] it's a
[1:03:42] disaster seen it many times myself that
[1:03:45] the son takes over for the father
[1:03:47] business and it's a disaster why they
[1:03:48] don't have the same ethics and all that
[1:03:51] stuff I'm talking about the world but we
[1:03:53] bring it here and said how how can a
[1:03:54] father trust his business with a boy
[1:03:56] that might simply pollute his whole
[1:03:58] inheritance he couldn't do that the
[1:03:59] church has got to come to a place so
[1:04:01] there's got to be like I said
[1:04:04] predetermined Destiny of a group of
[1:04:06] people to be adopted that's right can't
[1:04:09] get away from it but you can plug
[1:04:11] yourself into it all right God's on that
[1:04:14] work right now
[1:04:17] discipline that's why I say and I agree
[1:04:21] that we have had a
[1:04:23] pastor that has taught us adoption more
[1:04:26] than anybody I've ever heard in my
[1:04:28] life so he's got us in a mindset of that
[1:04:33] so let's carry on with it all
[1:04:36] right let's carry on with
[1:04:39] it sir Romans 8 ver 211 we stop right
[1:04:42] here because the creature itself also
[1:04:43] shall be delivered from the bondage of
[1:04:45] corruption look in bondage in God there
[1:04:49] is no bondage now Paul was a prisoner of
[1:04:53] Christ
[1:04:55] but he wasn't
[1:04:56] bound you know even in his even in his
[1:04:59] incarceration they let him move around
[1:05:01] he didn't he wasn't bound up they he
[1:05:03] wrote many of his letters while he was
[1:05:05] sitting in
[1:05:06] prison maybe we ought to try that don't
[1:05:08] get in a real
[1:05:10] prison because the creature itself also
[1:05:12] shall be delivered from the bondage of
[1:05:14] corruption and the Glorious Liberty of
[1:05:15] the what the children of God for we know
[1:05:18] all right we know all right so now stop
[1:05:21] right there we know we know all these
[1:05:25] things seals have been open trumpets vs
[1:05:30] plagues Thunders all the great Mysteries
[1:05:33] of the Bible Books
[1:05:35] open for we
[1:05:38] know then we know that the whole
[1:05:42] creation granth and travaileth in pain
[1:05:45] together look what Paul said until
[1:05:48] now he brings it present day but Paul
[1:05:52] was not predestinated to
[1:05:55] adoption he preached about it told us
[1:05:58] that we were but he never came to it
[1:06:00] that I understand that he came to
[1:06:01] adoption all right now he had Authority
[1:06:04] sure he did but to come to the end time
[1:06:07] adoption because we predestinated in the
[1:06:09] end time to come to adoption to get the
[1:06:11] people out of the Grave that's Paul
[1:06:14] number irenius remember all that now
[1:06:19] watch and not only
[1:06:22] they but ourselves also also amen which
[1:06:25] have the first fruits of the spirit all
[1:06:27] right we've got the first fruits but you
[1:06:29] and I have the Harvest Time Coming we've
[1:06:32] had the latter rain but we got the
[1:06:34] Harvest rain now that's going to what
[1:06:36] Harvest a group of people off the face
[1:06:38] of the Earth everybody with me that's me
[1:06:40] and you but you got to come to
[1:06:43] maturity if I would have made corn this
[1:06:45] year and the deer hun destroyed it it
[1:06:48] would have come to maturity and I'd have
[1:06:50] got it out of the
[1:06:52] garden not before
[1:06:55] the deer thought
[1:06:56] before we saw a bunch of them out in the
[1:06:58] field the other day they took a picture
[1:07:00] and sent it to us a bunch of them 15 or
[1:07:02] 16 16 of them out there in the field I
[1:07:04] said There goes my
[1:07:06] garden I'll get one or two of them we'll
[1:07:08] figure out way to get that I'll get some
[1:07:11] of my garden
[1:07:12] back it'll be strong meat and not only
[1:07:16] they but ourselves also Paul said art
[1:07:19] not only they but us which have the
[1:07:22] first fruits of the spirit even we
[1:07:24] ourselves grown within ourselves how
[1:07:26] many times do you say God get me out of
[1:07:29] this get me out of
[1:07:32] this look waiting for the adoption to
[1:07:37] wit now that word wit begins a word
[1:07:40] called
[1:07:42] witness so to wit or to see or to
[1:07:46] witness the Redemption of our body we
[1:07:49] will see someone come to
[1:07:52] that Paul did not arenus did not brother
[1:07:58] brandom did
[1:08:02] not so who's who's it following another
[1:08:06] generation another uh Church
[1:08:09] age another Prophet the only next
[1:08:13] Prophet that comes you're not going to
[1:08:15] hear him if you hear him you miss the
[1:08:18] Rapture cuz he's going to Israel you see
[1:08:20] all that working over there you see that
[1:08:22] big Soup pot yeah they stirring that big
[1:08:25] Soup pot up but I'll guarantee you
[1:08:26] there's two witnesses over there right
[1:08:27] now I say in the name of the lord
[1:08:29] they're there don't know where they're
[1:08:31] at but they're there cuz it's time for
[1:08:34] us to get out of here when we do they
[1:08:35] can't be little babies right they got to
[1:08:37] be mature their self in whatever they're
[1:08:39] in the Orthodox or wherever they are
[1:08:41] they may be fighting right now but guess
[1:08:43] what they can't die that's right they
[1:08:46] just don't know that
[1:08:47] yet but once they do they'll know
[1:08:49] they've got 1260 days to preach the
[1:08:52] gospel to the Jews take out 144,000
[1:08:57] and2 and take a Rapture but you and I
[1:09:00] that's not to us that's right like I

[1:09:49] before are going to go out of here and
[1:09:52] God's going to come back down and speak
[1:09:53] to the Jews through two prophets we know
