[0:02] all right quit that all right now we're
[0:04] ready all right let's go
[0:06] all right good morning everybody
[0:09] thank you for
[0:10] being here today we got a little thing
[0:12] we can all read now so you don't have to
[0:14] really bring your books
[0:15] are gonna bring your have you bring the
[0:17] statue of a perfect man book but i think
[0:18] we'll just read it off of here if that's
[0:20] all right with y'all
[0:22] you can put notes in it you bring your
[0:24] book yeah you can put notes in if you
[0:26] want to bring your book
[0:27] but um what we're gonna do is today is
[0:29] i'm going to read this we're going to
[0:31] read a few things that brother brown
[0:32] talks about the statue of a perfect man
[0:35] and then we're going to start on
[0:37] the foundation of faith you'll notice
[0:40] live me a sermon you see that right
[0:42] there what that look like okay that's
[0:45] what we're heading toward
[0:47] all right we're going to read what the
[0:48] prophet said about it
[0:50] but everybody turn your bibles to second
[0:52] peter
[0:53] one
[0:58] and
[1:07] we'll uh
[1:09] get what the
[1:11] prophet said now i want to
[1:13] thank susan and donny for giving me this
[1:15] this is not a ipad but it's close enough
[1:18] it's good enough for me because i use it
[1:19] with all the sermons and everything i
[1:21] need they joe and
[1:23] some of the brothers put all the sermons
[1:25] that i preached with all the notes on
[1:26] the
[1:27] in this computer so if i go out wherever
[1:30] preaching
[1:31] i can read it off here but i can also
[1:33] print it off and have it in my hands so
[1:36] it makes it a lot easier
[1:39] oh well i'm sorry
[1:41] but uh i don't like a preacher
[1:44] like he's reading it off with a book
[1:46] well you won't ever find me itself down
[1:48] here scrolling i won't do that up in the
[1:50] pulpit because i get out from the pulpit
[1:52] i have to carry this with me all the
[1:53] time you know
[1:55] you see some of them preachers they i
[1:56] don't know how they're going to get like
[1:58] brother gilforney could never use well
[1:59] he'd break it before he can get started
[2:03] he wouldn't even bother he would yeah
[2:05] he'd have 14 or 15 of
[2:15] right so now let's read
[2:17] let's read it out of the bible and then
[2:18] we'll let the prophet read so we're
[2:20] going to start on the statue of a
[2:21] perfect man
[2:23] simon peter a servant
[2:25] and an apostle of jesus christ to them
[2:28] that have obtained
[2:30] that word obtained there means entrance
[2:34] the word obtained there means influence
[2:36] so there's an in something that we've
[2:38] entered into and you'll read here we'll
[2:40] let the prophet
[2:42] paraphrase down through here but let's
[2:43] read it according to the scripture first
[2:45] to them that have obtained light
[2:48] precious faith so in other words paul
[2:51] peter's saying
[2:52] you've obtained the same faith i have
[2:54] and peter got his on the day of
[2:56] pentecost right
[2:58] now what was different in peter and then
[3:00] the 3000 the 120 in the upper room
[3:03] they walked with they walked with the
[3:05] virtue himself they walked with jesus
[3:07] christ for three and a half years
[3:08] everything he said sure it was a mystery
[3:11] to most of them
[3:12] sure it's a mystery to most of us even
[3:14] in our
[3:15] walk with god but he planted that in him
[3:18] and then when the holy ghost fell on him
[3:21] it quickened because that's what he said
[3:23] he said when i come i'll
[3:25] quicken what you've heard and show you
[3:26] things to come all right
[3:29] so peter could write this because peter
[3:31] was in this position of
[3:33] having the virtues working in his life
[3:35] like i said last sunday peter said
[3:37] silver and gold have i none but such as
[3:39] i have what do you have faith virtue
[3:41] knowledge temper faces god as well and
[3:42] kindness
[3:44] all right
[3:44] and he had a certain part of love let's
[3:47] go put that out and say he didn't have
[3:48] any level he had a certain part
[3:51] of the capstone ministry but he didn't
[3:53] have the
[3:54] fullness or the
[3:56] apex or the adoption
[3:59] part of
[4:01] what brother brown was going to show us
[4:02] that's why brother ram had to come and
[4:04] preach
[4:05] the statue of a perfect man in 1962 to
[4:08] bring us back to the faith of the
[4:09] fathers then he could open the seal
[4:12] that's what i'm saying we we can have a
[4:14] knowledge of the seals and we can have
[4:15] an understanding of the seals and we can
[4:17] listen to brother dale like he said oral
[4:19] robbers has got a copy of the seal we
[4:20] can read it in the book
[4:23] but see we've got to be where these six
[4:26] virtues one two three four five six
[4:29] seven virtues i mean are working in our
[4:30] life
[4:32] then the seals can really be open
[4:34] if we're just floundering around down
[4:36] here within your earth yeah we can have
[4:38] a part of of the seal but it's just
[4:40] that's just reading the book
[4:42] i read the sailboat to show you that the
[4:43] white horse writers the antichrist
[4:45] because that's what the prophet said
[4:46] right
[4:47] right
[4:49] but having these virtues working in our
[4:51] life
[4:52] really shows us who that antichrist is
[4:55] because
[4:56] if you're not for the word you're
[4:58] against it so you're anti-word
[5:02] that's right
[5:03] amen even if you're born again that's
[5:06] right
[5:08] that's what dad's been told you'd be
[5:10] born again in your snow you can be born
[5:11] again in your soul well how'd you have
[5:14] wesley and luther teach father son holy
[5:16] ghost baptism yeah and they had a new
[5:17] birth right
[5:19] i don't see that yeah but when you say
[5:21] anti-word i feel like the word's been
[5:24] uh offered to you when you turn it down
[5:26] no
[5:27] we're born anti-word you know what
[5:29] daddy's been telling us you're born
[5:30] anti-word
[5:32] and we're continue hang on a minute
[5:34] you'd be born again in your soul
[5:36] but that father son holy ghost baptism
[5:38] was never taught by the new birth so
[5:41] that's anti-word okay
[5:43] right is that anything in the word that
[5:45] was right no but god winked at that
[5:47] because it's been hidden that's why to
[5:50] you and i it's been revealed okay and we
[5:53] can take it
[5:54] and we can say we know what
[5:56] justification is we know what
[5:58] sanctification is now we know what the
[6:00] new birth is but we still why why do you
[6:03] think we need these virtues what if we
[6:05] got everything when we got the holy
[6:06] ghost why do we need knowledge
[6:08] what does knowledge do
[6:11] knowledge of the word of god cast out
[6:12] that antichrist that's right
[6:16] see people the antichrist is not our
[6:18] gender in here it's right here
[6:23] brother brown come to a place to where
[6:25] he was anti-word because the word he saw
[6:27] the white horse rider right away from
[6:29] him in other words that anti-word that
[6:31] he
[6:32] was had a part of before
[6:35] because he preached a while horse rider
[6:37] was the holy ghost
[6:38] that's anti-word that's not the word
[6:41] that's right that's anti-word
[6:44] see anti-word doesn't mean
[6:47] that you have to totally disagree with
[6:48] the word now somewhere you will
[6:50] or somewhere you'll come into this
[6:54] why do you think people are dying going
[6:55] by the grave
[6:58] they're not the fullness of the word
[7:01] they have anti-word right here
[7:03] this is anti this is always anti right
[7:05] here
[7:06] that's why the mark is 666 in the
[7:08] forehead not on the forehead in the
[7:09] forehead what in your intelligence
[7:11] that's what dad's trying to do he's
[7:12] trying to kill that anti
[7:15] against
[7:18] how else can you explain it how can you
[7:19] explain that martin luther went through
[7:21] the world with the baptism my holy ghost
[7:23] just like you got it
[7:26] right
[7:27] but yet he taught a false doctrine okay
[7:30] right anti-word
[7:33] but god winked at that knowing that you
[7:35] and i now we have no excuse
[7:38] zero right excuse now we come up to now
[7:42] where if we turn the word down then
[7:44] we're anti-word total okay all right
[7:46] does everybody understand that what the
[7:48] words got to do that's right they didn't
[7:50] have the true word that's why it's got
[7:52] to develop it's got to be something that
[7:54] develops in you that's right being born
[7:56] again well why do you need to being born
[7:58] again if you're don't have something
[8:00] anti in you that's right
[8:04] this is antichrist
[8:07] this thing right here is anti-word
[8:08] that's right it didn't come the right
[8:10] way right does everybody understand that
[8:11] i know you don't understand but you
[8:12] better understand your anti-word until
[8:15] the fullness of the capstone comes you
[8:17] better
[8:19] can i ask questions
[8:21] my question is
[8:23] brother browning said
[8:25] the evidence of the holy ghost is when
[8:27] you say amen to everyone
[8:29] that's in christ is the mystery of the
[8:31] reveal i can say amen to every word but
[8:33] do you make it fulfilled every day
[8:35] nowhere now no no my question is
[8:39] how can you have the holy ghost
[8:42] or the new birth in your entire world
[8:44] the same word i just explained it you
[8:47] weren't listening i know the flesh will
[8:49] never be saved that's right so that's
[8:51] what i'm talking about
[8:53] but this is anti-work like brother
[8:55] branham preaching
[8:57] the
[8:58] um white house writer is the holy ghost
[9:02] i look at it he had not uh
[9:04] come to the maturity of the word like in
[9:07] 63. so that's the entire word
[9:12] show me in the word where the holy ghost
[9:14] is the white horse rider
[9:16] show me in this word where the holy
[9:17] ghost is the antichrist as the holy
[9:19] ghost
[9:31] that's correct
[9:34] i'm telling you people
[9:36] we're so close
[9:37] will you tell me you explain to me how
[9:39] martin luther did it
[9:41] well he the only light that he had was
[9:44] the dresser that's correct that's right
[9:46] that's all he had that's right that's
[9:48] all you got until god revealed that yeah
[9:50] that's right
[9:51] listen people
[9:54] i don't care what you think that's what
[9:56] our problem is
[9:57] we say antichrist is oh they believe
[10:00] that out there no it's right here
[10:02] this is the anti
[10:04] now i'm not
[10:06] opposing you i just don't want to agree
[10:09] and i'm not seeing you okay you know
[10:11] i'll be i'll be foolish to just go along
[10:14] with everybody and i'm not seeing it but
[10:16] i want to see it does everybody
[10:18] understand where i'm going with this yes
[10:19] i am honestly i'll let you just say it
[10:21] and to god reveal it i mean you talk to
[10:23] talk and talk and talk about it if i
[10:25] don't get it and until god reveal it to
[10:27] me it's not going to come clear to me
[10:28] right and when he when he does you're
[10:30] going to see right you will see exactly
[10:32] what he said but you've got to wait for
[10:33] this and you're right about martin
[10:35] luther and john wesley they only had a
[10:37] part but that doesn't mean the word
[10:38] wasn't there
[10:40] right right right
[10:42] to everything else they were anti-word
[10:44] i'm sorry if you're for you're either
[10:47] for or against
[10:49] it's like me and brother uh
[10:51] tom earnest was talking about and
[10:53] brother donnie and i were hitting on it
[10:54] yesterday or day for yesterday
[10:57] no race intended it's black or white
[10:59] that's right there ain't no gray in
[11:01] between the gray in between is the devil
[11:03] that's right
[11:04] so it's either black or white that's
[11:06] right
[11:07] you're either a white righteous church
[11:09] or you're a white righteous church
[11:10] seeming to be i mean a black church
[11:12] seeming to be a white righteous church
[11:15] that's why we've got to have the
[11:16] antichrist driven out of us
[11:18] wait a minute now you got in your soul
[11:21] you got the new birth in your soul
[11:25] but let's just take for example
[11:30] well
[11:31] let's take uh
[11:34] both tom
[11:35] fogles
[11:36] why is he dead now oh he's 80 something
[11:38] ago well why is he dead
[11:42] some part of this let's just be honest
[11:44] some part of this didn't agree with the
[11:46] word
[11:48] or he didn't see it or he didn't say it
[11:50] he didn't see it he didn't see it
[11:54] okay would you say he had received all
[11:57] he was going to receive right
[11:59] right oh god god saw him receive what he
[12:02] was going to receive and right there was
[12:03] it but the part of him that was against
[12:06] the word went to the grave right but he
[12:08] didn't intentionally no i'm not saying
[12:11] you intentionally
[12:12] it's like it's like sister um
[12:15] like sister johnny said once it's once
[12:18] it's shown to you
[12:22] just like that right there's no
[12:24] struggling there's no
[12:25] but when it's revealed to you
[12:28] you instantly come to it or either if
[12:30] you disagree with it
[12:31] something's wrong with you
[12:34] something's wrong with you inside that's
[12:35] a good thing to know because you don't
[12:36] know you need you know that it's got to
[12:38] be straightened down until you know
[12:40] listen
[12:41] let's just i'm going to be hard that's
[12:42] what brother dale's been preaching for
[12:43] the past two or three months that's
[12:45] right it's not anti out there it's anti
[12:47] right here that's right that's right
[12:49] right here this is anti amen
[12:52] ask him he'll tell you
[12:54] pay attention in church
[12:56] he's trying to tell us this is untime
[12:59] this is okay but this is anti that's
[13:01] right brother why is brother dale say
[13:03] that's why we're still dying
[13:05] because even when we come to this
[13:07] capstone you're still brother brown came
[13:09] to the capstone but he died he went by
[13:11] the grave
[13:12] his work was over his work was finished
[13:15] so that's like saying okay
[13:20] oh but you can still sit in your flesh
[13:23] absolutely every day
[13:24] so that is like
[13:26] what you're saying that part is the
[13:27] answer you all are taking anti all the
[13:29] way over to the pope
[13:31] no that's not what i said i didn't say
[13:33] nothing like that that's right yeah
[13:36] you're not anti-like the pope just
[13:38] turned the thing down to start with
[13:40] you've got things in you that you don't
[13:42] understand that you struggle with let me
[13:44] tell you something let me be real let me
[13:48] we're okay
[13:49] sex is against the word
[13:52] that's right
[13:53] it's against the original word of god
[13:56] sex and if we do it then we're against
[13:58] the word of god that's why some people
[14:00] then though they take it over here to
[14:02] this side and they say oh don't have
[14:03] that no more
[14:05] no but then the bible comes back and
[14:06] says hey the bed is undefiled
[14:10] multiplying replenish the earth but now
[14:12] remember the multiplying and
[14:13] replenishing wasn't bisex to begin with
[14:17] it was by the spoken word
[14:20] but when eve took a what a thought that
[14:24] was anti-word
[14:26] she produced the
[14:28] product amen
[14:31] come on people we got to realize that
[14:32] anti's right here don't sit in church
[14:35] and think you're just so holy and pious
[14:36] and i know everything no
[14:38] we're anti-word until that word's
[14:40] revealed to us we're anti-words that's
[14:43] right
[14:45] on brother tom
[14:47] say he saw it like he's saying what
[14:49] would have happened taking a rapture
[14:52] if you the people that see the
[14:53] completeness all the way to a portion
[14:56] that they're allotted which is taking
[14:58] the forward of god to the headstone
[15:00] yeah they're not going to see death
[15:02] but now because death is the last thing
[15:04] to be destroyed and that's this thing
[15:05] right here you know how i look at it
[15:07] with brother tom
[15:10] um
[15:11] now if the rapture took place that time
[15:13] and he saw everything but god had a plan
[15:16] for somebody like jonas who was born
[15:17] after him
[15:18] i look at it like it was just not the
[15:21] time
[15:22] for the raptor to come in because we
[15:24] have
[15:25] born no you're seeing the rapture as a
[15:27] as a you're seeing the raptures that
[15:29] god's got a date on the calendar that's
[15:30] not it
[15:31] but i mean growing up though he didn't
[15:34] have to die tom died right but he's
[15:37] going up in the rapture the dead in
[15:40] christ shall rise first that's the one
[15:42] that's dead in christ that's why the new
[15:45] birth is the most important thing
[15:46] because see that gives you a free ride
[15:48] but it doesn't give this guy a free ride
[15:50] that's right
[15:51] then you understand what i'm saying
[15:54] because that's why we need why do we
[15:55] need all these virtues if we if we got
[15:57] the holy ghost and all we need that's
[15:59] why
[16:01] come on people we're missing the boat
[16:03] here
[16:04] not cut our hair that's wrong to reveal
[16:06] the whole word which had never been
[16:09] revealed down through the ages never
[16:11] even peter only saw a portion
[16:16] and you can say he was anti-word to the
[16:18] party he didn't see but because you're
[16:19] either for or against you said well i
[16:21] don't understand maybe we ought to use
[16:22] that we don't understand the word but
[16:24] what is that
[16:25] it's anti it's against
[16:27] right this was born against the word
[16:29] that's right brother branham said
[16:31] somehow
[16:33] maybe i'll bring that quote brother
[16:35] brown said somehow
[16:36] god came down through all this and he
[16:39] pointed it i believe he was pointing
[16:40] that came down through all of this
[16:42] and gave you the new birth
[16:44] so he birthed your soul not your body
[16:47] not your spirit
[16:50] memory reason conscious affection tell
[16:52] me that's born again
[16:54] you ever had a bad thought had one this
[16:56] morning
[16:57] so is that that is that word
[17:01] is that word yeah
[17:16] i'm telling you i'm standing here i want
[17:18] somebody to prove me wrong prove me
[17:20] prove to me
[17:22] that we're
[17:23] totally the word of god right now
[17:25] we're not going to lose
[17:27] yes we will i mean when you're out of
[17:30] here okay but we got to come to a place
[17:32] to get you you're thinking that god's
[17:34] just going to come on a day on the
[17:35] calendar now he's going to come on the
[17:36] day when somebody stands up and says
[17:39] death
[17:40] you don't have a part of this anymore
[17:41] and god's going to change these atoms
[17:44] why because of it the february the 23rd
[17:48] no because when you're ready
[17:51] when the word of god in you
[17:53] brother branham said
[17:55] what paul said i die daily
[17:57] so what are you dying from
[18:01] anti-word
[18:03] uh well when they asked for the brand
[18:04] and what was holding on to the rapture
[18:06] he said it was a great one and this is
[18:08] not a date not a day not a time it's you
[18:11] and i
[18:12] getting ready i'm glad this is this way
[18:15] it kind of shocks everybody it brings
[18:17] everybody to to realize that why do you
[18:19] think we needed the statue of a perfect
[18:21] man why did you think brother brown had
[18:22] to preach us back to brotherly kindness
[18:27] it has become
[18:28] anti-word
[18:30] down through the ages
[18:34] you know what i think throws people off
[18:35] it does me that word anti because that
[18:38] makes it sound like boom you're against
[18:40] this but when you're rejecting that's
[18:43] not rejected but remember when brother
[18:44] brown said we said that the antitype
[18:49] does that mean is this against
[18:52] the type and the antitype no that's just
[18:54] a part of the type it's just not the
[18:56] type it's an antitype that's right so
[18:58] anti is not always against
[19:01] okay but you're always agreeing with the
[19:03] word that's correct because it comes to
[19:04] you that's a sign of the holy spirit
[19:06] that's right but do you do everybody do
[19:09] you do everything that bible says yeah
[19:11] no no no because the whole thing hasn't
[19:13] come to you that's right right so you're
[19:15] against this right here
[19:18] that's why the word is so important
[19:21] nothing else is important
[19:24] see i think we and honestly let me let's
[19:26] be honest i think that we do we throw up
[19:28] a shield
[19:29] we're in the message we've got all the
[19:31] word that's the worst thing you can do
[19:34] that's the worst thing you can do is sit
[19:36] there and go we've got all the words so
[19:37] we're okay right no we're not
[19:39] we're in the worst condition we could
[19:41] ever be in it right that's right
[19:43] because we do have the opening of the
[19:45] word the open book right
[19:49] and we're
[19:51] denying it
[19:53] you say oh i'm not denying it well
[19:58] you got all the virtues working in your
[19:59] life
[20:05] our life proves it did we just do the
[20:07] most simple thing yeah that's right
[20:10] that's what i was going to say don't get
[20:11] caught up into semantics of the word
[20:14] anti-word that's correct you're
[20:15] anti-word until you obtain until that's
[20:18] right thank you sir
[20:19] thank you sister
[20:21] you have grown so much
[20:26] i couldn't have said it nobody are you
[20:27] ready you four and finish
[20:28] you got about 20 minutes
[20:32] but you are anti-war but when when you
[20:34] become anti-word like y'all are thinking
[20:37] about is when the words presented to you
[20:39] and you go no i'm not doing that that's
[20:40] not right right that's what they're
[20:42] thinking
[20:43] see that that that that that baptism i i
[20:46] i to stay with father son holy ghost
[20:48] or or we say well i got brother brown
[20:51] said have godliness to be like god
[20:54] but he said we've got to act like god
[20:56] that's right like mama said the simple
[20:58] things we do do we come to church on
[21:00] time do we read our bible do we study do
[21:02] we pray for the pastor every sunday not
[21:04] just when we think about it
[21:08] then you're against the word of god
[21:10] the bible says pray without ceasing yeah
[21:25] i believe what we do is
[21:27] this is our this is our
[21:30] um
[21:32] life
[21:34] is that we are because you can't you you
[21:37] put body spirit and soul and you make
[21:38] little circles there's no certain you
[21:40] can't cut yourself into and see three
[21:42] circles
[21:43] just like this you can't you can't cut
[21:45] yourself into and see a line of faith
[21:47] and a line of virtue and a line of
[21:49] knowledge or half a line of this no this
[21:51] is just for illustration purposes
[21:55] but it is that the holy ghost is in the
[21:58] soul
[22:00] waiting on you to bring the word to it
[22:04] right
[22:05] you say oh no it's the word now the
[22:08] prophet said
[22:10] he's in there waiting on you
[22:12] to bring the word to it
[22:14] and if you don't bring the word to it
[22:17] it's laying out there against that's
[22:19] right
[22:20] but when it's presented to you and you
[22:22] say praise god how many times you've
[22:24] been sitting up there and you've been
[22:25] wondering and struggling about something
[22:27] let me show your answer my word sorry
[22:30] but when brother dale bring something or
[22:31] any other preacher and you go that's
[22:33] what that means well you know what that
[22:34] just comes over and fits in a slot
[22:37] you got a little gap of anti in there
[22:39] sorry we do
[22:41] yes we do and it comes over and go but
[22:43] you know what
[22:45] people that are anti from the inside
[22:47] they go i don't believe that at all and
[22:49] they just let it go
[22:51] now that's anti that all are thinking
[22:53] i'm talking about but it's not
[22:55] i talk about that when the word's
[22:56] presented to you and you receive it we
[22:59] say thank god and we don't do that no
[23:01] more or we have come to a position that
[23:03] that doesn't bother us anymore then that
[23:06] anti parts don't
[23:10] brother brown said we sin every day
[23:13] as christians
[23:15] why do we stand what is sin
[23:18] oh it's not smoking drink concussion no
[23:20] that's the office that's why
[23:22] unbelievable what
[23:24] have i just proven my point yeah
[23:27] yeah
[23:28] that's what he said
[23:30] he said that woman stepped up and said
[23:32] pray tell man brother what is it he said
[23:34] it's until
[23:37] of this right here all right not what
[23:39] some man teaches you or your grandma
[23:41] tells you or your mama killed you
[23:43] it's unbelief the prophet said that
[23:45] unbelief is sin
[23:48] unbelief what so what is unbelief you
[23:50] have belief and unbelief
[23:53] for and again
[23:55] the word and time
[24:02] i accept that
[24:04] because i need it
[24:06] because then if you don't then you can
[24:08] have some of these virtues we're going
[24:09] to read it maybe read it in a little bit
[24:11] no we're not either
[24:13] we're not going to read anything
[24:20] hey we're going to use this thing just
[24:22] for a minute okay we'll come back to it
[24:23] let's just read what the prophet said
[24:25] about it though watch this but what i'm
[24:27] this is what i'm saying is we've got to
[24:28] realize though brothers and sisters
[24:33] that the growth process shows that we're
[24:35] anti somewhere
[24:37] yes
[24:38] sure just the growth process that's
[24:39] right
[24:40] right brother branham brother brown
[24:42] didn't say you got the holy he said
[24:43] you've got the holy ghost and you've got
[24:44] everything you need for your journey
[24:47] but he says he's waiting on him to bring
[24:50] the holy ghost is waiting on you
[24:52] to what bring him the word
[24:55] why not for the holy ghost
[24:57] for you
[25:00] the holy ghost don't need the word it is
[25:01] the word that's right
[25:03] but if you want to say it's kind of like
[25:04] a capsule
[25:06] you know what you take a pill and it's
[25:08] like a capsule all that good stuff's
[25:10] inside of it right right but what's
[25:12] going to happen if it stays inside that
[25:13] capsule
[25:15] it don't do you no good
[25:17] but once that thing dissolves in your
[25:19] belly because of warmth moisture
[25:22] good warm water water in the word what
[25:24] happens what's inside
[25:28] out and does you good
[25:29] that's what we have got to realize we
[25:31] got to realize that's why we that's why
[25:34] sometimes we as message believers go and
[25:36] a lot of people out there believe that
[25:38] once you get bored again you're way up
[25:39] here
[25:40] because it says holy spirit but brother
[25:42] brown
[25:43] brother brown we'll talk about it that's
[25:44] the holy spirit that seals it all
[25:46] together
[25:47] the total package deal
[25:50] not just the faith down here because
[25:52] this is a new birth down here
[25:54] and without this you can't have virtue
[25:59] so i want us to step here this morning
[26:01] and think that we're all lost
[26:03] and we need to be born again really
[26:05] that's something we got to grow
[26:07] that's the growth part that's why you
[26:09] you can say anti or i'm saying anti and
[26:11] you can say growth and it's the same
[26:13] thing to me
[26:14] i'm against the word until the words
[26:16] revealed to me that i've got virtue
[26:19] peter had a revelation
[26:22] that what he got on the day of pentecost
[26:23] he could use
[26:25] because he said silver and gold have i
[26:27] none he wasn't rich
[26:29] he'd actually quit his job
[26:31] he wasn't fisherman no more he was the
[26:33] fisher of men but he said silver gold
[26:35] have a number such as i have what he
[26:37] have he had enough virtue in him that
[26:39] god had placed in him to where he could
[26:41] say but what i have
[26:44] i give unto you okay
[26:47] now how many of us can do that
[26:52] we got to come to a place
[26:54] that this thing is
[26:56] and i fall short i'm not as a minister
[27:00] there's more guns pointed at me than
[27:01] y'all that's true because if god if
[27:03] satan can get me he's got you i've
[27:05] always said that if satan can get
[27:07] brother dale he's got all of us
[27:10] but if you can't get him
[27:11] he can't get us that's right that's why
[27:13] we need to pray for him hold him up and
[27:15] really pray for him because he's got
[27:17] battles and struggles he'll take his
[27:18] sins every day yeah yeah
[27:21] he's got unbelief that's what we do yes
[27:23] yeah
[27:24] his wife's shaking her head
[27:27] he's but i mean there's a part that he
[27:28] doesn't understand there's a part of
[27:30] life
[27:31] and we all have to live life and i was
[27:32] talking about the sex part don't take it
[27:34] to the other extreme where people say oh
[27:36] it's so dirty no it's not it was it was
[27:38] a loud of god
[27:40] you hear me aloud it's permissive well
[27:43] but god did say that that's the way now
[27:44] you need to multiply replenish the earth
[27:47] and be one with your spouse because
[27:48] we're supposed to have
[27:50] a relationship with god just like we
[27:52] have a relationship with our wife in a
[27:53] type
[27:54] he's supposed to make love to us and
[27:56] bring us the word and give us the word
[27:57] of god right we're supposed to embrace
[27:59] god and he's supposed to give us the
[28:00] word of god that's what it says but you
[28:02] can carry it over to the extreme bring
[28:04] it back to the middle of the road oh
[28:06] yeah
[28:07] i doubt if you can't love your wife you
[28:09] can't love god
[28:11] our husband
[28:13] our husband yes
[28:18] but realize one thing
[28:20] if you're not born again you can't have
[28:23] any of these virtues you can have a
[28:25] portion of them just in human life
[28:28] some people are just good nature they're
[28:30] just good yeah
[28:31] some people are not but the ones that
[28:33] are not if they get born again and they
[28:35] go up the statue of performance what's
[28:37] that doing that's killing that anti part
[28:43] right right that's the only way i can
[28:44] see it
[28:45] being born again
[28:47] by what the incorruptable word i didn't
[28:49] finish with the
[28:51] thing but by the incorruptible word
[28:54] see the word's incorruptible but we make
[28:56] it corruptable
[28:58] right we make it corruptable
[29:02] you're just agreeing okay i'm saying
[29:04] okay so all right let's read this what
[29:05] the prophet said just real quick so now
[29:08] let us read now first peter ii peter the
[29:10] first chapter simon peter servant
[29:11] apostle jesus christ to them that have
[29:12] obtained life precious faith with us
[29:14] through the righteousness of god and our
[29:16] savior jesus christ i like the way that
[29:18] stated right there because my whole
[29:20] subject this morning is based
[29:22] on faith let me read that again listen
[29:24] close simon peter servant apostle of
[29:26] jesus christ of them that obtained light
[29:27] precious faith
[29:31] with us through the righteousness of god
[29:33] and our savior jesus christ all right
[29:34] let's go notice he says that i have
[29:37] obtained
[29:41] all right because my whole life subject
[29:44] i got to get over here and put my
[29:46] pointer in the right direction
[29:48] this is all new to me notice he says i
[29:50] have obtained this faith
[29:52] and i've been dressing to them that has
[29:54] obtained the like precious faith
[29:57] all right that's what he's talking to
[29:59] the reason brother brown liked this
[30:00] scripture if you read them down through
[30:02] the statue of perfect man he says this
[30:04] is to the church those that are in
[30:06] christ so peter has brought it into a
[30:09] he's narrowed it down to where he's
[30:11] a sinner can't a sinner can't understand
[30:13] this
[30:15] if you've obtained like precious faith
[30:17] you've entered into the faith of god in
[30:20] your soul
[30:21] then you bring it the word and you see
[30:24] whether that agrees with what's inside
[30:26] of you or not
[30:28] if it does that's where brother brown
[30:30] said the holy ghost only agrees with the
[30:32] word
[30:35] that's the way you and i if you hear the
[30:36] word and disagree with it
[30:40] i would say i don't understand it is the
[30:43] best thing
[30:44] and you know what daddy says god's not
[30:46] revealed that to me yet
[30:48] yeah
[30:51] question mark not a period question
[30:52] god's not revealed that to me
[30:54] yet and there's a lot of things god had
[30:56] revealed to me yet but if i have the
[30:58] holy ghost he promised he would reveal
[31:00] it to me but you know what if i quit
[31:02] doing this and quit quit coming to
[31:04] church and quit studying and quit
[31:05] reading my bible guess what
[31:07] god's just going to take me off the
[31:09] scene remember the member of the
[31:10] preacher
[31:11] remember the preacher brother brown said
[31:13] he had the holy ghost
[31:15] he said i'm tired of it i'm finished he
[31:17] went and got drunk and started drinking
[31:20] two months later god took him home
[31:21] because he wasn't going to marry his
[31:22] name what
[31:24] the anti part of him took over
[31:29] sorry
[31:30] you say holy ghost and drink beer
[31:33] what the prophet said
[31:35] that's what brother brown said
[31:38] you know what you say it's the thing
[31:39] that's hard it is hard to understand but
[31:41] you just got to believe and say okay
[31:43] until i agree with the word i'm against
[31:45] it you saw i agree with everything do
[31:47] you
[31:49] do you
[31:50] let me read where you're supposed to be
[31:51] this and let me read where you're
[31:52] supposed to be that let me read where
[31:53] you're supposed to be this
[31:55] and and we'll see
[31:56] on that brother
[31:58] god's not an indian giver
[32:02] that's right he was his son
[32:04] and like anybody child he
[32:07] came home no the boy made a choice
[32:10] true if he would have chose not to
[32:12] started start drinking he let a spirit
[32:14] get on him that was against the word of
[32:16] god
[32:17] i'm sorry
[32:19] he did he let a spirit get on him that
[32:21] was against the word of god that didn't
[32:23] mean he's not a christian
[32:25] yeah that just meant god wasn't going to
[32:26] let him do that very long that's why you
[32:28] see a lot of people dying and doing
[32:30] things you don't understand a lot of
[32:31] things we don't understand that's why we
[32:32] just leave it alone that's right god
[32:34] takes somebody home you never know
[32:36] what's going on in their life okay
[32:38] because god's dealing with them god's
[32:39] dealing with me and you one on one
[32:42] right
[32:43] individual affair with god
[32:45] you're the one that knows whether you're
[32:46] treating your wife right whether you're
[32:48] treating your husband right whether
[32:49] you're
[32:50] slipping around and cutting your hair or
[32:51] slipping around and saying little bad
[32:53] things or taking this or doing this who
[32:55] knows only you but one day it's going to
[32:58] all manifest
[33:00] one day it's all going to come to life
[33:02] but right now we're in a growth process
[33:04] how can brother brown say there's made
[33:05] believers true believing unbelievers in
[33:06] every congregation
[33:10] he knew because he could look into the
[33:12] inner part of man you and i can't do
[33:13] this like dad said i'm totally glad god
[33:16] don't give me discernment of what y'all
[33:18] thinking about while we're preaching
[33:20] we'd be very discouraged because we
[33:22] could see the made believers we could
[33:23] see the unbelievers they would be black
[33:25] remember the woman or man would walk up
[33:27] in the prayer line he said i see you
[33:29] have a
[33:30] you're very pleasant in other words they
[33:32] had the holy ghost
[33:35] he had the holy ghost
[33:36] right
[33:38] even a woman preacher would come up and
[33:40] he said i see you have a wonderful
[33:42] spirit about you now that's the
[33:44] anti-word but see that wasn't the part
[33:46] she was supposed to play
[33:47] we know now that's not right
[33:50] but she's gone on to be with god and her
[33:52] reward so we don't know how that how
[33:54] that played out but if you got the holy
[33:56] ghost you shouldn't be preached you
[33:57] shouldn't be preaching
[33:59] but now we know in our message believer
[34:03] camp
[34:04] all of us we see that you're not
[34:06] supposed to one was not supposed to
[34:08] preach so now we see
[34:10] that if you are in the message and you
[34:11] think you can preach
[34:13] you don't have the holy ghost you're
[34:15] anti to start with
[34:17] right
[34:19] but see at that time he did she didn't
[34:21] know that we got to go real quick here
[34:23] but she didn't know that
[34:25] wasn't revealed to her yet but once it
[34:27] was revealed then it goes right around
[34:29] watched a lot of times they come he says
[34:30] sister whatever you've done
[34:32] you need to get it straightened out blah
[34:34] blah blah
[34:36] just like jesus told that girl in the
[34:37] bible go and sin no more unless the
[34:40] worst thing come upon you
[34:42] same thing with you and i we need to be
[34:44] careful we are sinners saved by grace
[34:47] but we still have sin
[34:49] which is
[34:51] one more time i want you to say it yeah
[34:53] my
[34:54] unbelief
[34:56] that's anti from belief yeah right right
[34:59] oh steady yeah we'll get to this maybe
[35:03] next sunday
