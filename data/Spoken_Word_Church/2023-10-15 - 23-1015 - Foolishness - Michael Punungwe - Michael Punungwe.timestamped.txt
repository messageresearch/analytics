[0:00] it's good to be here
[0:02] amen you have your Bibles we'll turn to

[0:46] and and be in your house Lord and just
[0:49] open your word up to us Lord thank you
[0:51] for allowing us to come here Lord and
[0:53] pray for those who aren't able to be
[0:54] here Lord pray for those who struggling
[0:57] right now with different afflictions
[0:58] Lord and just pray that you
[1:00] put your spirit over them and guide them
[1:02] Lord and give them the strength they
[1:03] need to pursue on Lord and just pray
[1:05] that in this service today Lord you
[1:07] reveal yourself unto us Lord and and we
[1:09] get closer to you Lord and get a better
[1:12] understanding of what you're trying to
[1:12] tell us and how what you're trying to
[1:14] guide us in our lives Lord pray for the
[1:15] service Lord pray for the song service
[1:17] and the preaching to come Lord and thank
[1:19] you for all things and lead us and guide
[1:21] us forgive us of all things and purify
[1:22] us in your presence Lord in your pres
[1:24] name of Jesus Christ I pray
[1:26] amen
[1:28] amen 1 2
[1:34] 3 1
[1:36] Corinthians 1
[1:41] 2 1 Corinthians chapter 1 verse
[1:46] 10 now I beseech you Brethren by the
[1:49] name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you
[1:52] all speak the same thing and that there
[1:53] be no division among you but that ye be
[1:56] perfectly joined together in the same
[1:58] mind and in the same
[2:01] judgment
[2:04] amen excuse
[2:07] me in the same judgment for it hath been
[2:10] declared unto me of you my brethren by
[2:13] them which are of the House of Khloe
[2:15] that there are no contentions among you
[2:18] now I say now this I say that every one
[2:21] of you saith I am of Paul I am of
[2:24] Apollos I am of sephus and I am of
[2:26] Christ but is Christ divided with is
[2:29] Paul crucified for you or were you
[2:31] baptized in the name of Paul I thank God
[2:34] that I baptized none of you but Crispus
[2:37] and
[2:38] gas lest any should say that I had
[2:40] baptized in my known name and I baptize
[2:43] also in the household of stefanus
[2:45] besides I know not whether I baptize any
[2:48] other for Christ sent me not to baptize
[2:51] but to preach the gospel with wisdom
[2:53] with not with wisdom of words lest the
[2:55] Christ lest the Cross of Christ should
[2:57] be made of none effect so here Paul is
[2:59] talking
[3:00] to the church and he's saying why why is
[3:01] there so much division in the church why
[3:03] is you know people having their own
[3:05] denomination say I was baptized with
[3:07] this man of this man of this man but
[3:09] really it's not the men it's not the
[3:11] preachers it's not it's not the the
[3:13] people in the deacons and the people who
[3:15] are in the offices but it's really God
[3:16] working through them so it's not about
[3:18] us following a man or or following
[3:20] somebody or that's a really nice brother
[3:23] or I go to this church because you know
[3:25] this I like that preacher and then you
[3:27] know that preacher leaves and then they
[3:28] kind of Follow That preacher it it's
[3:30] really about if you see the the work of
[3:32] God moving in the church if you see the
[3:33] spirit of God and the power of God in
[3:36] the church so it's not about your
[3:38] favorite Minister your your top five
[3:40] list whatever it is but it's about who's
[3:42] number one on that top five list which
[3:44] is God so that's what we need to focus
[3:46] on is and if he's number one then
[3:48] everyone else you know the pastor the
[3:50] preachers the deacons they'll all just
[3:52] fall right under him and it'll be
[3:54] perfect harmonization and Union so it's
[3:57] not about you know they're trying to say
[3:58] I I was baptized with this person
[3:59] baptized of this person Apollo Seas but
[4:03] it's it's about Christ it's about him so
[4:06] if you're baptized of of Christ of him
[4:08] if he was in your baptism not if you
[4:10] know brother so and so baptized me or
[4:12] brother this and this baptized me but if
[4:14] Christ baptized you that's what you need
[4:16] to worry about and so if if he if he's
[4:18] baptized you then you're
[4:21] set
[4:24] amen and once again you know Paul's
[4:26] talking here not to preach the gospel
[4:28] you know with wisdom of words lest the
[4:31] Cross of Christ be made of none effect
[4:33] so it's not what we're here to just you
[4:35] know be an emotional emotional message
[4:38] or you know we could hire a great
[4:40] motivational speaker we could hire
[4:42] someone who is really smart and
[4:43] intelligent and could then just fly
[4:45] words all over you and just sprinkle
[4:47] things and you know kind of like Janice
[4:49] and jambus they said we have the same
[4:51] magician tricks that you know you have
[4:53] but it's not the magician tricks it's
[4:55] not just a bunch of fancy words it's not
[4:57] just trying to make you feel a certain
[4:58] way but but it's the power of Christ
[5:01] coming through you know flesh coming
[5:03] through life coming through a microphone
[5:05] to get to you and to to guide you and
[5:07] your life and we think that
[5:12] um we we think sometimes that we want
[5:15] you know to to come to church and have
[5:18] this some type of experience but but it
[5:20] needs to be the right experience it's
[5:21] not just about you know that all all the
[5:24] flashing lights and smoke machines you
[5:26] see in some church these days but it's
[5:28] about if God is here am and it's really
[5:31] about if God is speaking to you now even
[5:34] brother brandom talks about his first
[5:36] sermon and he he tried to make he got
[5:38] everyone so emotional he got them crying
[5:40] he got them you know feeling amazing or
[5:42] whatever they felt they just they felt
[5:44] something in their heart that just you
[5:46] know made them want to cry and then he
[5:47] gets back to the pastor and he says that
[5:49] was the worst sermon ever heard cuz what
[5:53] were you talking about where was God in
[5:55] that you know so it wasn't about you
[5:57] know that everyone was crying or
[5:59] everyone was just shouting and speaking
[6:00] in tongues but but but the god enter
[6:03] into their hearts and minister to them
[6:05] in a personal way so you might it may be
[6:08] quiet everyone might just be sitting
[6:09] down and and everyone's just you know
[6:11] has a look on their face but and and it
[6:14] might not look like something's going on
[6:16] but it's what's going on under the
[6:17] surface you know same with when you when
[6:18] you plant a garden when you put a seed
[6:20] in the ground on the surface you might
[6:22] not see anything going on but give it a
[6:24] month give it six months give it a year
[6:27] and you'll see the fruits of what was
[6:28] what was what what was in the ground
[6:30] start to sprout up and you then you'll
[6:32] see the life you know but if if you just
[6:35] you you could you could you know
[6:37] whatever you want to do to the ground
[6:38] you could Shout at the ground you could
[6:40] stomp on it you could you could scream
[6:42] at it but if there's not a seed of life
[6:44] in there nothing's going to come out so
[6:47] there there's no point in in trying to
[6:48] make a show there's no point in trying
[6:50] to get a mo motivational speaker there's
[6:52] no point in trying to get lights and the
[6:53] smoked machine but it's just a point of
[6:56] of whatever's here I'm just giving it
[6:59] out to you in the way that God revealed
[7:01] it to me so it's not it's not about a
[7:03] show but it's about what's happening in
[7:05] your heart and there may never be may
[7:07] never be a noise there may never be an
[7:09] amen there may never be a shout or a
[7:10] scream but if God is changing a heart
[7:12] then that that's what matters you know
[7:14] it's not about how much money is the
[7:15] church is drawing in it's not about you
[7:17] know how many famous people come here if
[7:19] the mayor comes here if if uh the
[7:21] president comes here whatever
[7:24] happens I didn't mean it like
[7:27] that I didn't mean it like that but
[7:31] but it
[7:32] doesn't it doesn't M it doesn't matter
[7:34] how how high profile the person is it
[7:38] doesn't matter uh you know whoever would
[7:40] come here it doesn't matter if a famous
[7:42] athlete would come here it doesn't
[7:44] matter who it is but it's it's about
[7:46] it's God in the church you know it's God
[7:48] here it's not about all that other stuff
[7:53] so and if we if we lean to those things
[7:56] in our Humanity we we'll make the Cross
[7:58] of Christ of n effect as the Bible is
[8:00] saying as Paul is saying so we have to
[8:02] be careful of what we're listening to
[8:04] and what we allow ourselves to listen to
[8:06] and be yielded to and to always you know
[8:08] check the spirit inside of us to make
[8:10] sure that that same spirit is is in
[8:12] what's being brought forth that's right
[8:15] so not not just oh well that's a good
[8:17] Minister and and he's he's been
[8:18] preaching for a long time so he knows
[8:19] what he's talking about but you need to
[8:21] know what you're talking what you what
[8:22] you know and what you're what he's
[8:23] talking about in order to know if what
[8:25] he's talking about is Right CU it's
[8:26] going to come out the word it has to or
[8:28] else Cross of Christ will be made of
[8:30] none effect as the scripture
[8:33] says and
[8:35] continues Verse 18 for the preaching of
[8:38] the Cross is to them that perish
[8:40] foolishness but unto us which are saved
[8:43] is the power of God for it is written I
[8:46] will destroy the wisdom of the wise and
[8:48] will bring to nothing the understanding
[8:50] of The
[8:51] Prudent where is the wise where is the
[8:54] Scribe where is the disputer of this
[8:56] world hath not God made foolish the
[8:58] wisdom of this this world and there's so
[9:01] much so many things that maybe we do as
[9:03] Believers that people believe are
[9:05] foolish and they don't understand it
[9:06] it's like why you know why is it in in
[9:09] 100 degree weather in Georgia that
[9:10] you're still wearing pants or why you
[9:12] wearing that skirt or what why why do
[9:14] you do these things why why do you spend
[9:15] so much time you know why do you drive
[9:17] so far to go to a church and then sit
[9:20] there for two hours for two sermons and
[9:23] you that that's your day off work you
[9:24] just stay at home and relax and what are
[9:27] you doing here why why do you always and
[9:29] there's so many things that they just
[9:30] see foolish but really in God it's
[9:32] wisdom so the foolishness of the world
[9:34] is the wisdom of God so the things that
[9:36] they see as foolish we understand that
[9:38] it's edifying to our souls and that it's
[9:40] not it's not just foolishness it's not
[9:41] just you know something we're making up
[9:43] but it's really God in the church and
[9:44] that's why we come so far that's why we
[9:46] come from these different places and
[9:48] that's why you know we just accept
[9:50] everyone who comes the way they are
[9:51] because we know that God can do a work
[9:52] in their life so it's not that we're
[9:54] wasting our day off of work it's not
[9:56] that we're we could be doing something
[9:58] better with our time there's nothing
[9:59] nothing better we could be doing but to
[10:01] be in the house of God and and and you
[10:04] know receiving his promises and and
[10:05] opening his word and having it unveiled
[10:07] to us and and and all his people and
[10:09] being just around the people of God
[10:11] being around good influences and and and
[10:13] to be edifying to each
[10:16] other as the scriptures opening up to
[10:20] everyone's heart
[10:21] individually
[10:28] amen
[10:30] so yes what's seen as foolishness
[10:32] is actually the power of God working
[10:35] working in every one of us on verse
[10:38] 21 for after that in the wisdom of God
[10:42] the World by wisdom know not God it
[10:44] pleased God by the foolishness of
[10:46] preaching to save them that believe for
[10:48] the Jews require a sign and the Greeks
[10:51] seek after wisdom but we preach Christ
[10:53] crucified unto the Jews a stumbling
[10:55] block and unto the Greeks foolishness
[10:57] but unto them which are called both Jews
[10:59] and Greeks Christ the power of God and
[11:02] the wisdom of God because the
[11:04] foolishness of God is wiser than men and
[11:06] the weakness of God is stronger than
[11:09] men so even through the foolishness of
[11:11] of having a man come up here and just do
[11:13] his best to try try and get something to
[11:15] you and the foolishness of you know even
[11:18] if you know the Bible even if the dumb
[11:19] donkey talk to you if it's the truth you
[11:21] have to listen to it you know cuz that
[11:23] that same Spirit of Truth should be in
[11:24] you so e no matter how it comes forth or
[11:27] where it comes from or who says it it's
[11:29] still true and even sometimes you know
[11:31] sometimes we hear the same message we
[11:32] feel like we're we're coming to the
[11:34] church and we're hearing the same thing
[11:36] every week but it's not any less true
[11:38] yesterday than it is today you know the
[11:40] same that 1 plus 1 is two and a thousand
[11:42] years of later 1 plus one will still be
[11:44] two and and the promise of Christ and
[11:46] the sacrifice that he made is never less
[11:48] true it's never should never you know be
[11:50] less effective to you it should never
[11:53] lose it its spark in your heart whether
[11:56] today whether we keep preaching for a
[11:58] thousand years it doesn't matter matter
[11:59] because it's it's it's true so it's
[12:01] always true no matter how long it's been
[12:03] it's true no matter how far ago it was
[12:05] it was true right so it'll always be
[12:07] true it's an eternal
[12:10] truth and you know verse 25 again
[12:13] because the foolishness of God is wiser
[12:15] than men and the weakness of God is
[12:17] stronger than men so even the best that
[12:19] we can do isn't isn't half as good as as
[12:22] the as the worst that God hyp
[12:24] hypothetically the worst that God could
[12:26] do you know even even even our the best
[12:28] that we could do if we just live the
[12:29] best life we could and we try to do all
[12:31] these works and it just still be filthy
[12:33] rags so it doesn't even matter how much
[12:35] we try to work and how much we try to
[12:37] pump up and put all this effort into it
[12:39] it's just filthy rags you know and
[12:41] imagine maybe it was your birthday and
[12:43] it's a great day everyone with you happy
[12:46] birthday it's a wonderful everyone's
[12:48] giving you presents and then you open
[12:49] one present and it's just some filthy
[12:51] rags there and it's just some dirty it
[12:53] smells it as soon as you open the box
[12:55] you smell how filthy it is you want to
[12:57] throw up and that that's our
[12:58] righteousness that's all we can amount
[12:59] to that's all we can do it's just some
[13:02] filthy rags and and to offer that before
[13:04] God as a gift is that's foolishness but
[13:07] if we just lean to what God wants then
[13:12] it'll be open to us CU then you know the
[13:14] best we can do is
[13:16] not the smallest God can do is better
[13:18] than anything that we could ever produce
[13:20] the whole of humanity could ever
[13:23] produce and to think of of greatness our
[13:25] our conceptualization of greatness you
[13:28] know we would think of someone who's
[13:29] great maybe we think of someone who has
[13:30] a lot of money maybe we think of someone
[13:32] who's really tall or really strong or is
[13:34] a great can fight anybody and does what
[13:36] they want and when we think of greatness
[13:38] we really think of Goliath we really
[13:39] think of a a great tall man who can do
[13:42] whatever and he he can just no one
[13:43] messes with him and he goes where he
[13:45] wants and does what he wants but when
[13:47] God was bringing forth his word he
[13:49] brought it through David just a small
[13:50] run the run of the litter just a a
[13:53] shepherd's boy you know his H father
[13:57] wouldn't even consider him
[13:59] isn't that something his own father was
[14:02] like oh him like like here are all my
[14:04] sons all of them are these all your sons
[14:06] oh well I mean there's someone else but
[14:10] his own father would wasn't even he's
[14:12] like oh it couldn't be David I mean
[14:14] David's
[14:15] just but God saw saw David's heart and
[14:18] that was a man after God's Own Heart it
[14:20] was David so it doesn't matter what the
[14:22] world thinks you know the world may look
[14:24] at you and just see something weird and
[14:25] strange but God sees you God SE your
[14:29] heart so it's not even we don't have to
[14:31] worry about what everyone else thinks
[14:33] cuz David wasn't worried about what
[14:34] everyone else thought cuz everyone else
[14:35] thought oh we're not going to fight
[14:36] Goliath that's crazy I mean look at him
[14:39] he's killed how many people now and he's
[14:41] just this great ferocious man and he's a
[14:43] giant and and it it' just be impossible
[14:45] but God David wasn't thinking about what
[14:47] everyone else thought David knew that
[14:49] God made him a promise David knew that
[14:50] he was going to be king and David took
[14:53] that promise and slew Goliath because
[14:55] because he knew he knew something that
[14:57] no one else knew and even today we know
[14:59] something we know things that no one
[15:01] else knows that they're not aware of so
[15:03] we need to come forth with that that
[15:05] same boldness to the throne and and
[15:07] throughout our lives and knowing that
[15:09] God is in us trying to do a work through
[15:12] us you know no matter who we are in our
[15:14] lives in our daily lives just trying to
[15:16] be an example of Christ and and not not
[15:18] you know falling back on your on your
[15:21] beliefs or changing for the crowd that
[15:23] you're in or or whatever the case may be
[15:26] but we need to stand firm on what what
[15:28] we believe
[15:30] amen amen and verse
[15:33] 26 for you see your calling Brethren how
[15:36] that not many wise men after the flesh
[15:38] not many mighty not many noble are
[15:41] called but God ha chosen the foolish
[15:43] things of the world to confound the wise
[15:46] and God hath chosen the weak things of
[15:47] the world to confound the things which
[15:50] are
[15:51] Mighty now that word confound it just it
[15:55] just throws a wrench in people's plans
[15:57] you know when they think that
[15:59] you know the world is so obsessed with
[16:01] the education and and bringing things
[16:03] forth through education and and the
[16:06] intellectualization of everything that
[16:08] everything has to be know through the
[16:09] book or by the book and brother B talks
[16:11] about this all the time where you know
[16:12] people can lose God you know through
[16:14] pursuing education and he he of course
[16:16] never said that he promoted ignorance
[16:18] that you should always of course get
[16:19] your get your degree or not get your
[16:21] degree but you go to school and be
[16:23] educated you don't have to get a degree
[16:25] but be educated he's not promoting
[16:26] ignorance he's not promoting that you
[16:28] you know don't be smart or or not that
[16:29] you can't you know be scientific minded
[16:32] but when it comes to the word you have
[16:33] to completely surrender all those other
[16:35] parts of you to the word even if you are
[16:37] you know someone who's educated who
[16:39] likes to you know look at things
[16:41] rationally a lot of times but when it
[16:42] comes to the word you just have to
[16:43] believe what he said and then that's how
[16:45] you accept the promise it's not through
[16:47] any you know rational understanding or
[16:50] or logic or or we're trying to put God
[16:52] through the scientific method so we can
[16:53] prove him but God will prove himself
[16:56] through his word it's not he's not going
[16:57] to prove himself to according to man's
[16:59] laws you know and a lot of times when
[17:00] people you know who don't believe they
[17:02] talk about you know God doesn't show
[17:04] himself God doesn't prove
[17:06] himself but often times the the problem
[17:08] with them is not that it's proof or
[17:10] evidence the problem is that they have
[17:11] really have a heart issue it's that they
[17:14] don't want to surrender their heart so
[17:15] now they they've made things up so that
[17:17] they they have an excuse not to know
[17:19] because there's many people uh like many
[17:21] you know famous atheists will say oh
[17:23] there's no proof and there's no this and
[17:25] then someone will say well if God was
[17:27] real and he he did come you like that
[17:28] and and they would say they still
[17:29] wouldn't follow him so what's the point
[17:31] of him revealing himself if you're still
[17:33] not going to follow him so really
[17:34] there's no he he has no obligation to
[17:36] prove himself to someone where he
[17:38] already knows their heart and that they
[17:39] won't accept him so it's not it's not
[17:41] that oh there's not proof for God
[17:43] there's not evidence but it's really
[17:44] that we have a heart issue and that
[17:46] we're trying to you know have an excuse
[17:48] as to why we have this heart issue and
[17:50] instead of looking into ourselves we we
[17:52] look at God and blame God for our heart
[17:53] issue amen so if we look inside and if
[17:57] we we get right with God and we we study
[17:59] our heart and if we honestly examine
[18:01] ourselves we come to God humbly and with
[18:03] humility then he will reveal himself he
[18:05] reveals himself according to his word
[18:06] and not through the intellectualization
[18:08] of the world so it's not it's not going
[18:10] to be through you know being the
[18:12] smartest guy the smartest guy who who
[18:14] has the highest IQ and we'll get him up
[18:16] to preach because he clearly is going to
[18:18] know something more than we do but you
[18:19] know it's it's just the humility and the
[18:22] humbleness and it's not about your
[18:24] degrees or how smart you are or how how
[18:26] well studied you are but it's just about
[18:28] if if you were humble enough to allow
[18:30] God to dwell in you if you were humble
[18:32] enough to surrender completely to God
[18:34] and let him dwell in you and let him
[18:35] govern your life and and get rid of
[18:37] those things that you know you shouldn't
[18:38] be doing or that you know you shouldn't
[18:40] be there that that Grudge you're holding
[18:42] against somebody the attitude you have
[18:43] towards
[18:44] somebody just let that all go and if
[18:46] you're humble enough to accept that then
[18:48] God will show himself and prove himself
[18:50] in your life and and he he'll show you
[18:52] many works and that always it'll it'll
[18:55] confound the wise as the Bible says and
[18:57] a founding variable in science is
[18:59] something that just it just ruins the
[19:01] whole plan they just can't understand it
[19:03] it's this thing that you know if if you
[19:05] if you carry out a a scientific study
[19:07] with a confounding variable in it that
[19:09] study just it can't be it can't be
[19:11] recorded it can't be uh considered
[19:13] reliable but God puts those things in
[19:16] there and to confound the wise so that
[19:18] they don't understand it they think oh
[19:20] it just can't be done well if it's not
[19:22] the scientific method if it's not this
[19:23] if it's not that but God puts that in
[19:25] there and and to confound the wise but
[19:28] for the simple and the humble to
[19:30] understand it so he you conf confound
[19:33] things of the mighty you know people
[19:35] think someone who's Mighty is once again
[19:37] like Goliath is a great warrior and just
[19:39] very aggressive you can do what they
[19:41] want they don't have to listen to
[19:42] anybody but but what's mighty about God
[19:44] is that he's humble and even when he
[19:46] came he was so humble and even when
[19:48] people you know they were like oh the
[19:50] Messiah is going to come and he's going
[19:51] to come on like a chariot and he's going
[19:53] to lead us into battle and we're going
[19:54] to take the Holy Land back and he comes
[19:57] and he does doesn't he have a place to
[19:58] lay his head he comes as a you know his
[20:01] his uh Earthly you know father I guess
[20:03] was a Carpenter and he's just isn't that
[20:05] the son of Joseph like how is who was
[20:07] this guy and and they expect him to come
[20:10] in his Priestly robes and in his kingly
[20:12] robes and with a sword in hand ready to
[20:15] you know slice up the
[20:17] Romans but that's not how he came he
[20:20] just came humbly he just came so that
[20:21] anyone he could talk to anyone just came
[20:23] gently he came so that you know he could
[20:25] talk to a boy and mult and multiply that
[20:27] food for for you know a large amount of
[20:31] people he could do these simple Works in
[20:33] people's lives he could say get up and
[20:34] walk he didn't come so high and mighty
[20:36] that he couldn't just come down and talk
[20:38] to people and and people who were
[20:40] Sinners and and the way the Pharisees
[20:42] were they wouldn't even talk to those
[20:43] Sinners they like how how could you talk
[20:45] to these people and Jesus is like I'm
[20:47] I'm here for the sick people you know a
[20:49] doctor is here to for the sick people
[20:50] the doctor you're not going to see a
[20:51] doctor talking to only healthy people
[20:54] that's not what a doctor is for so in
[20:56] the way that you know we we try to
[20:59] interpret God's word sometimes but he
[21:01] interprets it by manifesting it so when
[21:04] those things are manifested that's how
[21:05] we know what God's will is it's not it's
[21:07] not for him to be H Mighty and boasty
[21:08] but it's for him to be humble and to
[21:10] come here and and to minister to us so
[21:12] that everyone can get it so that even
[21:15] people who aren't educated even people
[21:16] who who don't know the word completely
[21:18] even people who don't fully understand
[21:20] you know
[21:21] um I think uh brother Brown talks about
[21:24] how he didn't know how to pray so he
[21:25] just got the alphabet and just put it up
[21:28] and they said God you just make the
[21:29] words and and that type of and the fact
[21:33] and that God wouldn't look down upon
[21:34] that God wouldn't be so high above that
[21:36] and say well no you need to go to school
[21:38] and you need to get education so you can
[21:40] really know the big words and then you
[21:41] can write it down and then you can pray
[21:43] to me but God could just go to a child
[21:45] who just only knew the alphabet and can
[21:47] then just answer his prayer because he
[21:49] didn't know how to pray that God could
[21:51] just come down to us and where we were
[21:54] in all our lives and and where we were
[21:56] and and how how downtrodden and and and
[21:58] Unholy the things we did but he could
[22:00] just come to us and he wasn't he wasn't
[22:02] too proud he wasn't too Mighty he wasn't
[22:04] too high and above us to come to us so
[22:07] we need to walk and we need walk with
[22:10] that same humility so God bless you let
[22:13] the musicians
[22:13] [Applause]
[22:26] come
