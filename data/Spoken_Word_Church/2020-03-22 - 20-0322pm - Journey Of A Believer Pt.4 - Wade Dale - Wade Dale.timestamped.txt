[1:41] I want to see you hey man good to see

[1:52] the ones that are listening in from the
[1:54] comfort of your home would say god bless
[1:56] you if you here watching listening for
[1:59] the first time then god bless you
[2:05] we're gonna do the best with what we got
[2:08] amen we've been given an opportunity to
[2:11] use the technologies that the devil
[2:16] you've and devil uses it does his junk
[2:20] with it and we're gonna use it and for
[2:22] God's glory ma'am so we're going to
[2:25] we're going to just continue on and
[2:28] Wednesday night service brother Bob will
[2:30] be here and we'll be conducting it in
[2:32] the same way we are conducting it now
[2:35] everybody got that say ma'am well start
[2:38] at seven o'clock with just the crew that
[2:40] we got here the eight or ten or so a
[2:43] couple of musicians and that's what
[2:44] we're doing so we're we're okay with
[2:46] that everything's fine we're we're
[2:49] washing our hands and doing all that but
[2:52] we want to be like Martin Luther we
[2:54] don't want to cause anything to happen
[2:57] to someone else because we're they've
[3:00] noticed online there was somebody from
[3:04] somewhere not a message believer but
[3:06] they were just you know adamant they
[3:08] were gonna have full church and that's
[3:10] okay but I'm like brother Dale said the
[3:12] when brother Branham said she'll have
[3:14] just that the Lord or beef still well we
[3:16] don't have thus that the Lord that we
[3:18] can put ninety people back in this
[3:19] building not yet okay so we be still and
[3:24] know who's in control Amanda that's the
[3:27] way we're gonna do it from now on and
[3:29] until this thing is over with you know I
[3:31] was I was thinking yesterday about all
[3:38] the plagues and things that's hit this
[3:39] earth and you know even in the time of
[3:42] Moses Moses that's reading in Leviticus
[3:47] in different places how that they would
[3:50] get kind
[3:52] they'd be sinning and and God was sent a
[3:56] plague but he would also send Aaron with
[4:00] the sensor which was too far off the
[4:02] altar but now remember it stayed the
[4:06] plague it didn't eradicate it because
[4:09] there would be seven thousand killed in
[4:10] one day twenty thousand killed before
[4:12] they could get through that and that's
[4:13] the way I'm praying now that Lord we
[4:16] can't do anything about the ones that's
[4:17] passed on but may we as the bride of
[4:19] Jesus Christ all over the world take
[4:21] that fire off the altar which is not a
[4:23] literal fire announced inside of us and
[4:26] take that sensor and go out in don't go
[4:28] out into the world you understand what
[4:29] I'm saying but pray that God will stay
[4:32] this plague and then because that's what
[4:35] he in the Bible the whole Bible has
[4:37] plagues and different things that
[4:38] happened and we had the Spanish flu we
[4:41] were talking about this morning and it
[4:44] happened after the 1906 Azusa Street
[4:47] revival the Spanish flu started in 1918
[4:50] and killed 50 million people in the
[4:52] world and a lot of our servicemen came
[4:56] home with it and there was 57,000 people
[4:58] in the United States killed but brother
[5:01] Branham tells us he every time we look
[5:03] at this that influenza was one of the
[5:05] plagues that God poured out us in the
[5:07] Seven Church ages 1954 I'm looking at it
[5:09] right now when the mystery was revealed
[5:12] the baptism of the Holy Ghost the people
[5:15] didn't move on when the baptism the Holy
[5:17] Ghost came on the zoo the street 1906
[5:19] people started turning it down
[5:21] God sent a plague all right so what do
[5:23] we see now people are turning the word
[5:25] down people are turning the message of
[5:27] the hour down I'm not talk about the
[5:29] world the world turned it down when from
[5:30] the beginning I'm talking about two
[5:32] people in our ranks that's turning this
[5:34] thing down and got sinning the plague
[5:36] and it's for the whole it's a plague on
[5:38] the whole earth it's not just a plague
[5:40] on a certain group of people it's a
[5:41] plague on the whole earth so we just
[5:43] pray that God will stay that plague eyes
[5:44] praying yesterday I said God my children
[5:46] need salvation my grandchildren my my
[5:49] the people in this on this wall down
[5:51] below me they need salvation we need to
[5:54] absolutely pray more earnestly because
[5:57] that's why God's sensor sends a plague
[6:00] it he sends a play going to people who
[6:02] reject the word
[6:04] you don't send it on us I mean we're
[6:06] like the children of Israel we're in the
[6:08] lamb big ocean you know the plagues fell
[6:10] everywhere else but the children of
[6:12] Israel the chosen people of God went to
[6:15] Goshen well what's our Goshen the Word
[6:17] of God is our Goshen so we come here to
[6:20] get the word out to you out in the in
[6:22] the on the Internet and for those of us
[6:25] standing here a few of us here today
[6:26] that are just we're just support people
[6:30] that's here alone I want to reiterate
[6:34] that this is not normal but I don't want
[6:38] we're not gonna do away someone sent me
[6:40] a text message yesterday and wanted to
[6:43] know why that we were not letting the
[6:46] sisters play instruments anymore anymore
[6:49] that was the new norm they didn't read
[6:52] Bob's email right so it's just it just
[6:54] wasn't said that way this is temporary
[6:56] we want them to stay home with their
[6:58] children we want them to not not get out
[7:01] stay home with the children I don't have
[7:03] anything if the sisters wanted to come
[7:05] but we're just doing this because this
[7:07] is the pillar of the church this is the
[7:09] pillar of the people the Deacons the
[7:10] elder not even the elders the Deacons
[7:12] the pastors the system preachers deacons
[7:16] song leaders that's your spiritual
[7:19] leaders of the church and we feel that
[7:21] maybe being here that we can get it out
[7:24] to you remember we're still sheep sheep
[7:28] have to be led even even the president
[7:30] told us yesterday whatever you want to
[7:33] think of him I really don't care he's
[7:34] doing a pretty good job how would you
[7:36] like to be up there so don't give him no
[7:38] comment about that that's just a bunch
[7:39] of baloney
[7:40] but he's doing the best he can as a
[7:41] human being but he told the people he
[7:44] said look he said don't forget to pay
[7:45] your tithe don't forget to pay your
[7:47] offerings when you while you're not
[7:49] going to church so he didn't he did
[7:50] realize that that everybody needs
[7:54] leadership so we need to come to a place
[7:56] that we calm down and we do what needs
[7:59] to be done we're not invincible on the
[8:03] outside guy but we need to let the
[8:06] inside guy out because he's the
[8:08] invincible one and then as we were
[8:11] singing this morning brother Joe was
[8:12] singing you know when death and sorrow
[8:14] pain and all that's over with we don't
[8:16] have
[8:16] to worry about it no more when our Lord
[8:18] comes back to earth again all the sorrow
[8:20] pain and death this will all be just
[8:22] won't even be a memory because the Bible
[8:24] says the former things are passed away
[8:25] all the bad things you're not going to
[8:27] remember so we're not going to remember
[8:28] any of this but we got to get there
[8:31] first so that's why we're doing this to
[8:34] help it's kind of funny that being
[8:37] preaching on revival that remember what
[8:38] causes a revival a plague falls or
[8:42] something happens on the earth causes a
[8:45] revival so I hope this causes that
[8:47] revival that we've been looking for
[8:49] I hope this causes that word revival
[8:51] that we'll get back into the Word of God
[8:53] even though we're separated out into the
[8:55] parts of different parts of the earth
[8:57] but we all come together under one roof
[8:59] and that's the roof of the word of God
[9:01] amen
[9:02] so let's bow our heads and pray before
[9:04] we get started then we'll begin on on
[9:08] our subject of a journey of a believer
[9:10] we'll kind of recap Abraham's journey
[9:14] and then we'll get into hopefully
[9:16] getting to the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[9:17] so listen let's bow our heads Galatians
[9:20] 3:16 so we're going to start from the
[9:22] Heavenly Father we thank you for this
[9:23] day that you've given us we pray now
[9:25] that you would be Lord the one that does
[9:27] the speaking we know that we're very
[9:31] very very few in number but you said
[9:33] where two or three are gathered in my
[9:34] name that there you'll be in the midst
[9:35] you know we have different ones in
[9:37] different places watching in Lord may
[9:39] you comfort each one father that we have
[9:42] more faith than we do fear and that
[9:45] we'll take this thing Lord and will as a
[9:47] Christian we should get better because
[9:49] of this and not worse we should get
[9:52] better we should bind together more we
[9:54] should trust you more and pray father
[9:56] and I do pray now that you'll help our
[9:58] government that you'll help the people
[10:00] that are there that will do a job that
[10:02] will do the right job and get this thing
[10:05] straightened out Lord because we still
[10:07] need people like brother Dale said this
[10:10] is not the end but this is the beginning
[10:13] of something so this is something that
[10:15] we're looking forward to that word
[10:16] revival that will bind us all together
[10:18] for that last push to get us out of here
[10:20] Father forgive us of our sins bless this
[10:22] day Lord take care of each one just
[10:25] shield us from all this sickness and not
[10:26] just the coronavirus but all their any
[10:28] other kind of thing
[10:29] Lord you said you heal all of our
[10:31] diseases there's not one that you can't
[10:34] heal Lord we pray that you'd be with us
[10:36] and touch us now in Jesus name Amen
[10:39] Galatians 3 verse 16 through 18 now
[10:43] Abraham now to Abraham and his seed were
[10:46] the promises made
[10:47] he said not and to seeds as of many so
[10:50] it wasn't the natural lineage of Abraham
[10:53] or Abraham you might want to say but as
[10:56] of one and to thy seed which is Christ
[10:59] and I said this I say that the covenant
[11:02] which was confirmed before God in Christ
[11:04] the law which was 430 years other than
[11:07] other words 430 years after Abraham's
[11:09] death
[11:10] can I dis annul that it should make the
[11:13] promise of none effect for if the
[11:16] inheritance be of the law it is no more
[11:18] promise okay everybody got that but God
[11:22] gave it to Abraham by promise let's go
[11:26] to Hebrews 6 and even be seated Hebrews
[11:27] 6 verse 13 but when God made promise to
[11:31] Abraham because you could swear by no
[11:34] greater he swore by himself saying
[11:36] surely blessing I will bless thee and
[11:38] multiplying I will multiply thee and so
[11:41] after he had patiently endured look
[11:42] after he had patiently endured he
[11:46] obtained the promise you made me seated
[11:48] in Warren as blessing to the reading of
[11:50] the word here we've come into allergy
[11:54] season and everybody's hacking in
[11:55] coughing I don't think it's the
[11:56] coronavirus thing just a lot of a lot of
[12:00] pollen in the air and I thank God for
[12:01] that because he's pollinating the whole
[12:03] world and it doesn't matter my bees
[12:05] yesterday I was playing with my bees out
[12:07] there you know and letting the world go
[12:08] by and they were just working away they
[12:10] didn't you know they weren't scared they
[12:12] were doing their job so that's what
[12:13] we're gonna do we're gonna not be scared
[12:15] we're gonna do our job I will do just
[12:17] like nature we're just gonna continue on
[12:19] and we're gonna truly pray that this
[12:22] thing takes an end real quick brother
[12:25] Brown says who is this Melchizedek now
[12:27] we know if somebody maybe is watching in
[12:29] that doesn't know sometimes we quote
[12:32] these quotes from we believe God sent a
[12:35] prophet in the end time a seventh angel
[12:37] message which was guaranteed in the Book
[12:40] of Revelations that there would be seven
[12:43] messengers to seven church ages we
[12:46] believe we're in the last church age and
[12:47] we believe that God sent a messenger in
[12:49] every age Paul from Paul all the way
[12:52] down to this man we call William Branham
[12:55] and please don't look it up on the
[12:57] internet because you can all get all the
[12:59] bad so but you see us quote these quotes
[13:03] we're quoting from a prophet that would
[13:05] believe God's sin in the end time to
[13:07] give us a true revelation that we have
[13:10] gotten everybody got so off on different
[13:12] denominational ideas till Jesus Christ
[13:15] came and brought one message not 1,900
[13:17] he brought one message all right but we
[13:20] as man have divided it into fifteen or
[13:23] sixteen hundred different denominational
[13:24] ideas and they all think they're right
[13:29] so I think God sent us a messenger
[13:32] according to my life kana for Luke to
[13:34] have Athene 1730 revelation 10 verse 7
[13:37] that there was an endtime messenger sent
[13:40] and that we he was not God he was a
[13:42] messenger sent from God just like Paul
[13:44] we we quote Paul all the time why can't
[13:46] we part why can't we quote william
[13:48] branham ER or john g lake or the
[13:50] different ones that we do mighty men but
[13:54] we believe that william branham was sent
[13:55] in the end time to bring us the message
[13:58] according to malachi I mean according to
[14:01] revelation 10 7 in the days of the voice
[14:03] of the seventh angel when he begins to
[14:05] sound the mystery when mystery of God
[14:07] will be finished
[14:08] and he told us here in 1965 he said when
[14:11] Abraham met him and he was Melchizedek
[14:13] now remember we're going to read that in
[14:15] chapter 17 here in just a little while
[14:17] because remember chapter 17 is the type
[14:22] now remember Abram never had the new
[14:25] birth Abraham never was born again
[14:28] because he was in the Old Testament and
[14:31] the old custom it was under blood I'll
[14:34] get it out in a minute was under the
[14:35] blood of bulls and goats thank you
[14:37] Richard
[14:37] bulls and goats thanks for the help and
[14:39] and that was he was had his sins were
[14:42] covered not eradicated but now since
[14:45] Jesus Christ come 2,000 years ago died
[14:48] on the cross gave us gave his blood gave
[14:52] his life and that life came back into
[14:54] the believer in 120 in the
[14:56] room now God is residing in us not just
[14:59] with us God is not overshadowing us like
[15:02] he did in the Old Testament he should be
[15:04] inside of us because jesus said I'll be
[15:07] with you even in you till the end of the
[15:09] world so Abraham remembered Abraham
[15:12] never was a child of God Abraham was a
[15:14] friend of God but Abraham's journey
[15:17] Abram to Abraham that's what we're
[15:19] talking about now the journey of a
[15:20] believer we believe that we must go
[15:22] through three processes because three is
[15:25] the number of perfection
[15:26] we must go to three processes of
[15:29] salvation now many people teach once
[15:32] saved always saved that's okay if you
[15:34] were saved to begin with if it was true
[15:36] if God justifies you he'll take you to
[15:39] glorification according to the book of
[15:42] Ephesians I believe in there somewhere
[15:43] it tells you that those who he's
[15:45] glorified he's all he's justified he's
[15:47] already glorified but now remember if
[15:49] you justify yourself not good no that's
[15:54] you trying to justify you and I don't
[15:56] want that I want God to be the just one
[15:59] and then the Bible says the just and the
[16:01] justifier are the same all right so I
[16:04] want the justification that God took my
[16:07] sins put them in a sea of God's
[16:10] forgetfulness but I have a walk that I
[16:12] have to walk now that takes me on
[16:15] through to the indwelling of the baptism
[16:17] of the Holy Ghost not just an anointing
[16:19] or not just coming into a pew and
[16:21] sitting down or not just beginning to
[16:22] read my Bible when I didn't have
[16:24] anything else to read or you know you
[16:25] understand what I'm saying
[16:27] so when Abraham he goes through this
[16:30] journey and he's coming to where he
[16:31] meets Melchizedek and verse in chapter
[16:33] 17 we'll read it a minute the Prophet
[16:36] tells us he unfolds here what all the
[16:38] attributes now each one of us if you're
[16:40] a born-again Christian today you are an
[16:42] attribute of God you were in his mind
[16:47] before the foundation of the world
[16:49] you were you were a part of God now you
[16:54] didn't know that while you was on earth
[16:55] you didn't come to that knowledge until
[16:57] you get to Abraham's journey when he
[17:01] meets Melchizedek all right that's why
[17:03] you can't you say once saved always say
[17:05] that's okay if you continue with your
[17:08] salvation all the way to the end
[17:10] but don't be saved in 1964 and then now
[17:13] in 2019 you're still smoking and
[17:16] drinking and cussing and doing the
[17:17] things you were doing what you get say
[17:18] from salvation is saving you from
[17:21] something
[17:22] repentance is turning and going in that
[17:25] direction not in the direction you were
[17:27] going in so that's what we're speaking
[17:29] of today through Abraham's journey
[17:32] because Abram made a lot of mistakes but
[17:35] God gave the promise to Abram before he
[17:38] was Abraham right all right so that's
[17:40] what we're gonna look at but brother mom
[17:42] tells us he unfolds here what all the
[17:44] attributes will do in the final end now
[17:46] obviously you and I are in the final in
[17:48] if you're if you're an attribute that's
[17:51] your question if you're an attribute and
[17:53] you believe this is the final end time
[17:55] then every son of Abraham which we are
[17:57] the what children of Abraham every son
[18:00] of the faith will absolutely do the same
[18:02] thing so we're going to absolutely take
[18:04] the same journey that Abram took to have
[18:08] a name change to Abraham have one
[18:10] promise son God told him said take Isaac
[18:14] thy son thy only son now he had Ishmael
[18:17] and seven other kids but they weren't
[18:20] the promise there's a lot of things that
[18:22] goes on in your life that you that God
[18:24] will allow to happen but there's only
[18:26] one promise and that's the baptism of
[18:29] the Holy Ghost he promised for this
[18:30] promises to you acts 2:38
[18:32] tells us with promise repent and be
[18:35] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[18:36] the remission of your sins and you shall
[18:38] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for
[18:40] the promise
[18:41] see that's what Abraham was looking for
[18:43] but he couldn't find that city you and I
[18:45] are that city he was looking for amen
[18:47] CDs not buildings a serious people amen
[18:53] every start of the faith will absolutely
[18:54] do the same thing so every one of us is
[18:57] going to have to be able to put in your
[19:00] journey what we're going to read here
[19:02] from Genesis 12:2 about Genesis 20 we're
[19:06] gonna see the walk of a man named Abram
[19:09] that Walton has many mistakes and does
[19:12] many things out of the will of God but
[19:14] he comes finally to a place to where God
[19:16] tells him in chapter 17 he says I've
[19:19] come now it's time for you to have the
[19:22] promised child so let's read in John
[19:24] twelve right here and you're under
[19:27] justification we see that what is
[19:30] justification justification is chopping
[19:32] off your past sins that means that God
[19:34] has called you you have accepted his
[19:37] call and you turn and you walk in
[19:39] another direction
[19:40] every sin that you have if you're truly
[19:42] justified every sin from that point
[19:45] backwards has been forgiven what a
[19:49] wonderful thing now the Lord said unto
[19:51] Abram get thee out of thy country all
[19:54] right so he's talkin to like I said
[19:56] before what's the difference in Abram if
[19:58] God's not a respecter of persons what's
[20:00] the difference in Abram and in Abraham's
[20:03] neighbor right God may have called
[20:05] everybody that was around Abram but
[20:07] Abram was the only one that physically
[20:10] got up and left get thee out of thy
[20:14] country that's why are you walking and
[20:16] many of us walked in circles of not
[20:18] gangs and gang members but we walked in
[20:21] in gangs of people we enjoyed being
[20:23] around why cuz we all did the same thing
[20:26] and you don't know if God called them
[20:29] but he had to somewhere down in the life
[20:31] he had to call every person has to be
[20:33] called of God but you're the only one
[20:36] you say why me Lord because you
[20:38] responded you responded and he knew you
[20:41] would respond and being that you
[20:43] responded you got up and moved and
[20:46] started doing the things because what
[20:48] happened he said look Abram get thee out
[20:49] of thy country and from thy kindred and
[20:51] from thy father's house and I watch it
[20:52] says from thy kindred yeah but remember
[20:55] what's the first thing he does he takes
[20:58] a lot with him unto a land that I will
[21:00] show thee and I will I will watch this I
[21:03] will I will make of thee a great nation
[21:06] and I will bless thee not anybody else
[21:10] this is God I the great I am I will make
[21:14] thy name great we still call it now six
[21:17] thousand years after after he's done
[21:19] passed off the scene and I will bless
[21:21] thee and make thy name great and thou
[21:23] shalt be a blessing and I will bless
[21:25] them that bless thee and I will curse
[21:27] them that curse thee and in thee shall
[21:29] all families of the earth be blessed so
[21:33] Abram depart
[21:35] the Lord has spoken unto Him and a lot
[21:37] went with him now that was his first
[21:38] mistake remember what we were saying
[21:40] that when Abram got God called Abram and
[21:43] not his kindred not anybody Abram gets
[21:45] up and you know it's just like we do
[21:47] when we get first get born or first get
[21:49] saved we come to a realization that
[21:51] we're lost well we want everybody else
[21:52] to realize their loss too right
[21:55] hey man you want to talk to you buddies
[21:57] and your friends and your girlfriends
[21:58] and all hey man I found this new and
[22:01] sometimes they go like you going crazy
[22:06] well that's kind of what Abram had to
[22:08] separate and you all of us did I hope
[22:11] none of you run with the same gang you
[22:13] used to run with we found a new game to
[22:17] run with hey man the born again we might
[22:20] have found some more Eagles to run
[22:22] around with amen but Abram departed and
[22:25] he took a lot with him and like I said
[22:26] before it's the play of words but he
[22:28] took a lot with it same way with you and
[22:31] I once we even in justification we still
[22:33] have the burden of sin in our past is
[22:36] gone but the same person that made you
[22:38] do it so in other words a week or two or
[22:40] three weeks or a month later if you're
[22:42] still walking in justification you've
[22:44] still got this desire to smoke and drink
[22:45] and cuss and run around and do all the
[22:47] things you did before but God is still
[22:49] though making you send conscious where
[22:52] you weren't sin conscious before he
[22:55] brings it to you but what would you do
[22:57] is you take a lot with you
[22:59] in every journey you take you take a lot
[23:02] with you all right but he's getting
[23:04] ready to separate from a lot are from
[23:07] mr. light amen he's getting ready to
[23:11] separate for him because something where
[23:12] are you gonna have to separate amen if
[23:15] you don't separate then you didn't get
[23:17] it to start with you just got a good
[23:22] feeling all right so now remember he
[23:25] departed and he went to Canaan verse 5
[23:29] but now when he came to look at verse 7
[23:32] I told him just keep scrolling through
[23:34] verse 7 and the Lord capital LRD
[23:37] appeared to Abram now if you look in
[23:38] your margin it talks about the Lord and
[23:42] costs theophanies you see that God God
[23:46] comes and he talks to Abram
[23:48] just like God listen did God not talk to
[23:51] you when you were starting your journey
[23:54] God didn't just save you and then say
[23:57] now later on in the journey he might say
[23:59] you know you grow up child but in your
[24:03] in your beginning of your journey God's
[24:05] always right there he's a daddy that
[24:07] that kid has just begin to learn to walk
[24:09] and he's over there holding y'all Heinen
[24:14] he's holding you up getting you to walk
[24:18] right because he knows you're gonna fall
[24:21] he knows that he knows you're gonna fall
[24:23] so he's right there to pick you up so
[24:25] the Lord appeared unto Abram and said
[24:28] unto thy seed will I give this land and
[24:31] they're building an altar unto the Lord
[24:33] first thing Abel started doing was
[24:35] starting what he started worshiping God
[24:37] he started coming to church he started
[24:40] getting himself into at least into some
[24:42] kind of religious order different than
[24:45] where he was at all right and then
[24:49] remember as you continue on up I want to
[24:52] get my Bible here so we can fly through
[24:55] this we've been through justification
[24:57] but just to just to look at it again
[24:59] because what happened was in verse 10
[25:02] just like now what does a famine do
[25:06] remember what I said what a famine does
[25:08] a famine makes you do certain things
[25:10] number one it makes you make a decision
[25:14] whether to stay there or to move all
[25:17] right so that's what happened here God
[25:20] never told Abram to leave and go to
[25:22] Egypt which Egypt is always a type of
[25:25] what the world amen so Abram in his
[25:29] justification walk he goes right back
[25:32] down into the world and that could
[25:35] happen to you at justification remember
[25:37] that unclean spirits still in there
[25:39] thereby okay with that but you've come
[25:42] to a place to where you're listening to
[25:44] God more than you're listening to the
[25:45] devil all right but he can't left he
[25:49] left because there was a famine he had
[25:51] to make a decision Abram went down into
[25:54] Egypt and there he got into a lot of
[25:55] trouble first thing he did start lying
[25:58] he lied about his wife he said I'll tell
[26:00] them you're my sister so you saved my
[26:02] it didn't matter if he was fixing to
[26:04] give us what give his wife to the king
[26:06] of Egypt he was trying to save me me
[26:10] Amen that Burt you remember what
[26:13] happened and look how much God was
[26:17] watching over Abram see because remember
[26:21] Abram didn't truly have a revelation at
[26:24] the time that he was going to have that
[26:26] promised child with Sarah right God just
[26:31] told him you're gonna have a promise son
[26:33] and you're gonna do this and I'm gonna
[26:34] do this and he never really ain't listen
[26:37] in your walk with God when you first
[26:40] start your walk with God you don't get a
[26:42] whole lot of details the details come
[26:46] later do you understand what I'm saying
[26:47] you didn't first time you got justified
[26:50] you didn't walk in the church and know
[26:51] about the seven seals and the seven
[26:52] plagues and in the vials and the Daniel
[26:55] 70 weeks and uh you were just struggling
[26:58] to be a Christian because you still had
[27:01] that old black dog in there working on
[27:03] you and it was deep inside and God's out
[27:08] here trying to motivate you to get rid
[27:11] of that one that's on the inside all
[27:12] right everybody got that saved man so he
[27:16] had Sarah now remember it's Abram which
[27:18] is hi father
[27:19] but now God's tell him he's going to be
[27:22] a father of many nations something's got
[27:25] to change
[27:25] same thing with Sarah Sarah means
[27:28] contentious and boy she was there for a
[27:30] while I would have been too if my
[27:31] husband would have said hey I'm gonna
[27:33] lie to save my skin you gonna go down
[27:34] there with that Egyptian guy and you
[27:36] gonna marry him but you know what God
[27:37] preserved Sarah because he knew she
[27:39] couldn't her womb couldn't be messed up
[27:42] until that promised son same way with
[27:45] the womb of your mind the womb of your
[27:47] heart and all the things we did God's
[27:53] preservative we just didn't know it yet
[27:55] we just didn't know it we know it now
[27:59] that's like brother Branham said brother
[28:01] down said the other day there's that was
[28:02] some little something even if you did
[28:04] something wrong while you were doing the
[28:06] thing wrong you had something inside of
[28:09] you to say God why am i doing this why
[28:11] am I continue to go back and do this why
[28:14] because the one motive
[28:15] did you to do it still there we got to
[28:17] get rid of that guy and that's why I
[28:20] Abram had to get rid of lot a lot Abram
[28:24] had to get rid a lot he had to begin to
[28:26] separate himself because this is a Walt
[28:28] between you and God not you and your
[28:31] friend and God because your friends
[28:33] always gonna turn you away from God
[28:35] your other old friends you understand
[28:37] what I mean we're not we're sure we're
[28:40] friends here humanly well but we're
[28:41] brothers and sisters we're part of the
[28:43] same family so we're family members
[28:45] helping family members not friends
[28:47] helping friends they'll be okay with
[28:50] that okay cuz your friends would get you
[28:52] in trouble
[28:52] look all down through the Bible all the
[28:54] friends that got people in trouble all
[28:55] right but we are sons and daughters of
[28:57] God and we've come to a place to where
[29:00] God has revealed itself to us not making
[29:03] us a special people but we are special
[29:05] people because God made us that way we
[29:06] didn't we didn't make us this way God
[29:10] made us this way and man they're okay
[29:13] with that now let's go to chapter 13
[29:15] when he continues on Abram finally gets
[29:18] out of Egypt there you go just keep
[29:20] scrolling well you got to get to chapter
[29:22] 13 mm-hmm there you go Anderson and
[29:27] Abram went out of Egypt finally the Lord
[29:31] got him out of Egypt but he took lot
[29:33] with him again so he took a lot with him
[29:37] amen
[29:38] a neighbor one was very rich somewhere
[29:41] down the line same way with you and I
[29:44] now we know he was physically rich but
[29:46] you and I are getting richer and richer
[29:48] in God even in our justification can you
[29:50] not remember in your journey you're
[29:52] going man why are all these blessings
[29:54] piling up on me and I know some people
[29:57] going well I never got any blessings
[29:58] well I don't know if you got justified
[30:00] or not because you know what you began
[30:02] your walking God was right there
[30:04] remember that babies right hearing gods
[30:07] walking right here he's not out got you
[30:08] out under yet he's got you right here
[30:10] he's watching over everything you do and
[30:13] he smacks your hand every once in a
[30:14] while and that's okay that's why you
[30:16] come to church get your hand smacked and
[30:17] all that other stuff
[30:18] my brother Dale always says if I'm
[30:20] stepping on your toes move your toes
[30:23] grief kind of simple and Abram was very
[30:28] rich so in other words God
[30:29] blessing Abram cuz you told him I'm
[30:31] gonna bless you he told Abram I'm going
[30:34] to bless thee
[30:35] so you starting your Christian journey
[30:37] God will bless you abundantly ma'am
[30:44] all right so anyway he goes on eternally
[30:46] journey he goes to Bethel which is what
[30:48] house of God so he starts going to
[30:50] church and that's the best thing today
[30:54] okay
[30:55] and Abram called on the name of the Lord
[30:58] in verse 4
[31:00] what's verse 6 and the land was not able
[31:05] to bear them who lot and Abram that they
[31:09] were both getting very wealthy alright
[31:13] and Abram comes down and says look my
[31:18] angels are fighting with your devils may
[31:22] I say that go labor look it's Abraham's
[31:25] herdsmen is not between Abram and lot
[31:27] it's between Abraham's cattle and the
[31:29] herdsmen of lots cattle the herdsmen of
[31:31] Abram so in other words listen hadn't
[31:33] you ever realized I was think about this
[31:35] so they had never realized so when God
[31:36] started dealing with you the devil
[31:38] didn't leave he was right there with you
[31:41] and he was bringing his abundance of
[31:43] demons and God was bringing his angels
[31:46] with the blessings and you know there's
[31:48] that constant contact I just got a
[31:53] revelation we must tell the devil he's
[31:57] got to practice social separation yeah
[32:05] well the government has told us six-feet
[32:09] we wished but in other words there's a
[32:13] fight going on through your whole
[32:14] journey we know that even now there's a
[32:17] fight going on but I hope it's a lot
[32:19] more angels than a lot less demons amen
[32:22] he said I don't know about God said he'd
[32:27] take care of his kids did you know man
[32:29] joy took care of Abram even during all
[32:32] this and Abram said unto lot let there
[32:34] be no strife I pray thee between me and
[32:36] D in between my herdsmen as I heard well
[32:38] we'd be brethren it's not the whole land
[32:40] before us in other words what did he do
[32:43] he told him he said look you picked the
[32:46] best ground I'll take what's left and
[32:52] then what happened was what lifted up
[32:57] his eyes and Locke looks at the green
[33:00] pastures and the plains of Sodom and
[33:02] this two nice City sitting down there
[33:05] and lot chose him all the plains of
[33:08] Jordan in lot journeyed East and they
[33:10] separated themselves one from another
[33:11] now lot heads down to eat heads down to
[33:15] Sodom and Gomorrha Abram does not go
[33:17] with him Abram there's a separation so
[33:19] in justification during the time of
[33:21] justification when you're walking with
[33:22] God
[33:23] there's things that's got to start being
[33:25] cut off that you even though you may
[33:28] still have that root of bitterness of
[33:30] that or that evil spirit inside of you
[33:32] attached to that soul that you have you
[33:34] still got to have come to a place to
[33:36] where you have to say look I don't want
[33:38] to do that no more I'm going in that
[33:40] direction you going in that direction
[33:42] devil I'm going in this direction so
[33:44] anyway Abram got rid of a lot so then
[33:48] where did Abram what he dwelled in the
[33:50] land of Canaan now that's the Promised
[33:53] Land and lot dwelled in the cities of
[33:55] the plain pinched his tip towards Sodom
[33:58] but the men who sought him we know what
[34:00] happened they were wicked but now what
[34:01] do you do now look and the Lord capital
[34:03] L capital o kept our capital D the Lord
[34:06] centered to Abram that's God speaking
[34:08] directly to Abram and says after that
[34:11] lot was separated so see God's fixing
[34:12] that God didn't talk to him in that
[34:14] forum until he got a lot out of the way
[34:18] and then when he got a lot out of the
[34:20] way God comes look after that lot was
[34:23] separated from him lift up thine eyes
[34:25] and look from that place where thou art
[34:27] northward southward and eastward they
[34:29] shouldn't said eastward because you give
[34:31] east toward the to lot God don't worry
[34:34] about that God don't worry about that
[34:38] God said Abram you're my chosen guy you
[34:41] look north south east and west I don't
[34:44] care if locks down there I don't care
[34:45] sergeant down out start them done I'm
[34:47] fixing to change the whole deal you're
[34:49] gonna possess the whole place remember
[34:51] he told him wherever the sole of your
[34:53] feet for all the
[34:55] which now said to thee will I give it
[34:57] and to thy seed forever not seeds seed
[35:01] and I will make thy seed as the dust of
[35:04] the earth so that if a man can number
[35:05] the dust of the earth then shall thy
[35:07] seed be numbered arise walk through the
[35:09] land what is footprints possession
[35:14] footprints of the righteous or ordered
[35:16] of the Lord everywhere Abraham walked
[35:19] Abram at this time and Abram move this
[35:23] removed this tent and came and dwelt in
[35:24] the plains of Mamre which is in Hebron
[35:27] and built there another altar now
[35:29] remember he's building altars to God now
[35:34] remember in Genesis 14 that there was a
[35:37] battle happen and then we just see the
[35:40] jest of it so we'll go to chapter 15
[35:41] start with sanctification again but
[35:44] chapter 14 Abram goes and saves lot from
[35:49] dying which is the brotherly thing to do
[35:51] but what happens is this God is remember
[35:54] one thing's for sure they kept trying to
[35:57] get a give Abram all this stuff back
[36:01] remember all the kings down at the
[36:03] bottom all the kings says hey I want to
[36:05] give you this I want to give it
[36:06] Abram said nope God has separated me I
[36:11] see old friends are coming back going
[36:12] amen
[36:13] we're gonna have a beer party Saturday
[36:15] night 8 o'clock so you come you don't
[36:18] have to drink you have to stay away from
[36:22] that because you're separating yourself
[36:24] Abram you're not gonna walk like that
[36:26] anymore you're not gonna get caught up
[36:28] in that anymore you're not going to go
[36:30] back into Egypt anymore with the kind of
[36:33] attitude you had when the first time you
[36:35] went so Abram does this great thing and
[36:38] what happens in verse 18 is Melchizedek
[36:42] which is a man not a spirit Melchizedek
[36:47] is a person a man he met Abram coming
[36:51] back from the slaughter of the kings and
[36:53] what happened he give communion to them
[36:55] and he said bless you blessed him and
[36:59] said blessed be Abram even in
[37:03] justification after all the line and
[37:05] cheating and all the lot that you
[37:07] brought with you
[37:09] I'm telling you what God said about John
[37:10] because those who he's justified he's
[37:12] already glorified God knows this whole
[37:14] journey of your own you just don't know
[37:16] it but you better depend on God because
[37:18] if God blesses you blessed be Abram
[37:21] blessed be put your name in there
[37:25] because you're walking in the journey
[37:28] that God has asked you to walk in and
[37:30] he's going to bless you blessed be Abram
[37:33] of the Most High God possessor of heaven
[37:35] and earth and blessed be the Most High
[37:36] God which has delivered thine enemies
[37:38] into thy hands and he gave him tithes of
[37:41] all and then then the kings have thought
[37:44] him they're trying to give him all this
[37:45] stuff back and he said I'm knowing I
[37:47] don't even want a shoe latch it I don't
[37:51] wanna listen when you start in this
[37:53] Christian walk all you needs God all you
[37:57] need is God you don't need an old friend

[39:54] for his mother or somebody was in the
[39:55] hospital remember they sent to knows his
[39:57] mother right he said god bless her and
[39:59] he said but I've got something I got to
[40:00] do hear the words more important now
[40:02] whoever you would say that if your
[40:03] mother was in the hospital brother
[40:08] branham's your example right okay our
[40:11] cat gets the sniffles and we stay home
[40:12] and it's usually on Sunday morning yeah
[40:17] are you kids who come over on Sunday
[40:19] afternoon about 2:00 yeah anyway that's
[40:24] not God doing that though that's the
[40:25] devil we should be enough to know that
[40:27] that's the devil doing that that's not
[40:29] God but you know what that's in our
[40:32] journey because if ascent of Abraham's
[40:33] journey is gonna be an hour journey
[40:35] where the kings of Sodom are going to
[40:37] try to give you all kind of stuff on
[40:40] Saturday and Wednesday hey man but he
[40:42] said all I want is what my young men of
[40:44] Eden and the portion of men went with
[40:46] went with me so what he's he's he's you
[40:50] know he's getting taking care of his
[40:51] people but he said I don't want to know
[40:53] that let them take their portion in
[40:56] other words what God is your portion God
[40:59] is the one that gives you your portion
[41:02] let's read one less now let's go to
[41:04] Roman's 3 if you can brothers I'm gonna
[41:08] take my time this afternoon we usually
[41:09] get out of 4 o'clock then all right
[41:11] because I want to get finished with it I
[41:13] want to get to the baptism the whole ago
[41:15] being justified freely by His grace
[41:19] remember that's not you justifying
[41:21] yourself you justify yourself you're
[41:23] always going to go wrong being justified
[41:26] freely by His grace through the
[41:28] redemption that is in Christ Jesus whom
[41:32] God has set forth to be a perpetuation
[41:34] for picture
[41:35] and through faith in his blood to
[41:37] declare his righteousness not yours the
[41:40] remission of sins that are past remember
[41:42] we don't need we don't need forgiveness
[41:44] for sins for tomorrow we don't know what
[41:46] they are
[41:46] that's Catholicism we don't want that
[41:48] but we know what we did yesterday we
[41:52] know what we did this morning God
[41:54] forgive me of my sins that are past
[41:57] through the forbearance of God to
[41:59] declare I say at this time his
[42:00] righteousness that he might be just now
[42:03] he's not might be he is just alright
[42:06] that he might be just and the justifier
[42:08] of him which believeth in Jesus so I
[42:12] want the justifier to look at me and say
[42:16] you're just because of me
[42:19] you're just Ezekiel 11 verse 17 and
[42:23] we're going to hang with this one all
[42:25] the way up to the Holy Ghost because
[42:26] this should explain and help us it's
[42:28] explained how God deals with us as a
[42:31] Christian
[42:31] Ezekiel Evans says therefore thus saith
[42:33] the Lord I will even gather you from the
[42:35] people and assemble you out of the
[42:37] countries now what's he doing he's
[42:38] bringing us out what is redemption
[42:41] Redemption bringing out right coming out
[42:44] of the world and going into Christ all
[42:47] right mm-hmm and assemble you out of the
[42:50] countries where you have been scattered
[42:51] and I will give you the land of Israel
[42:54] and they shall come thither and they
[42:56] shall take away all the detestable
[42:58] things here we go we're walking not he's
[43:00] taking away all the detestable things in
[43:03] our life thereby got that day man
[43:05] therefore and all the abominations
[43:08] therefore from thence and I will give
[43:11] them one heart and I will put a new
[43:14] spirit within you now remember you might
[43:18] say that's the Holy Spirit but I
[43:19] remember we had a prophet of God to help
[43:21] us understand what the Bible is talking
[43:23] about that that is not the Holy Spirit
[43:26] that is a new spirit that we're going to
[43:28] look at in sanctification that is a new
[43:31] spirit to put you in a religious order
[43:33] or to get you higher up with God and to
[43:36] get that unclean spirit out of you
[43:37] because what is sanctification cleaned
[43:40] and set aside not put in service but
[43:44] cleaned and set aside to be put into
[43:47] service there
[43:48] got that and I will give them one heart
[43:51] then I will put a new spirit within you
[43:53] and I will take out what that old stony
[43:56] rebellious sinful heart that was so
[44:01] stoning you know that's like this you
[44:03] can't you can't move it but God said I'm
[44:07] gonna give you a heart of flesh what a
[44:08] heart of flesh is real pliable it's able
[44:11] God is able to mold you as the Potter
[44:13] molds the clay you can't start molding
[44:16] clay out of a rock right you have to
[44:21] have soft clay to mold with so god
[44:24] softens us up and that's what he's doing
[44:26] remember and remember in our Christian
[44:29] journey you remember how that you always
[44:31] feel the sweetness of God he said well
[44:33] don't you know well know as much as I
[44:34] did sorry
[44:36] God just wants you to walk sometimes and
[44:37] believe but you're starting your journey
[44:39] in mind everything made you cry song to
[44:41] make it cry preacher to make it cry you
[44:44] know somebody talking to you about the
[44:45] Lord you just are crying why because God
[44:47] is softening up that old stony heart
[44:50] that you had before same way with Abram
[44:53] Abram you're Abram he's what he's
[44:58] walking us through something that we're
[45:01] not used to because remember we were
[45:03] born in sin shaping the iniquity spousal
[45:05] my mother's womb we came here a liar we
[45:08] came here with that old Adamic nature
[45:10] that old nature that got that Satan gave
[45:13] us because of the fall because of our
[45:16] carnal mind it was attached to us from
[45:18] our birth first thing kid does is lies
[45:22] they'll steal they'll do all kind of
[45:25] stuff as a kid not knowing even you as
[45:28] we're like you walking in God but he's
[45:30] got to take that old stony heart out and
[45:33] put a heart of flesh in there now not a
[45:35] true heart transplant but it is a heart
[45:37] the heart of you is the center the heart
[45:40] of an apple is the core so the core of
[45:43] you or the heart of you is being changed
[45:46] amen so now in sanctification let's go
[45:49] now to Hebrews 2 verse 11 let's read
[45:53] these and then we'll get into what he's
[45:57] talking about because I came across a
[45:58] little something I should have brought
[46:00] out the other
[46:01] I didn't for both he that sanctify and
[46:04] they who are sanctified now what is
[46:06] sanctified it's a compound meaning
[46:10] cleaned and set aside for service
[46:14] alright it has two meanings two cleaned
[46:16] because the Bible tells you sanctified
[46:18] brother Dale ready this morning by the
[46:20] washing of the water of the word alright
[46:23] they who are sanctified the saint sorry
[46:26] let's read again for both he that
[46:28] sanctifies and they who are sanctified
[46:31] are olive one cuts brought you into a
[46:35] closer relationship to him to her in
[46:37] brother Brahim codes a religious order
[46:38] for which cause he is not ashamed to
[46:41] call them brethren saying I would
[46:43] declare thy name unto thy brethren in
[46:45] the midst of the church while I sing
[46:46] praises unto thee now let's read Ezekiel
[46:50] 36 and then we'll go to then brothers go
[46:52] to Genesis 15 1 after we read this I
[46:54] will take from you among the heathen and
[46:58] gather you out of the countries and will
[47:00] bring you into your own land then will I
[47:02] sprinkle clean water now look we're at
[47:04] Ezekiel 11 it told us he was taking the
[47:06] stony heart out putting the heart of
[47:08] flesh in he goes further now in Ezekiel
[47:11] 36 says basically the same thing in
[47:13] verse 24 24 verse 24 then will I
[47:16] sprinkle clean water upon you he brings
[47:20] in water and ye shall be clean from all
[47:24] your filthiness and all your idols will
[47:28] I cleanse you a new heart also will I
[47:32] give you now back in there
[47:33] now look and a new spirit will I put
[47:36] within you and I will take away the
[47:40] stony heart out of your flesh and I'll
[47:42] give you a heart of flesh basically the
[47:43] same thing but now he's saying I'm gonna
[47:45] put a new spirit within you alright and
[47:48] you look in the Bible you see where the
[47:50] Bible says the unclean spirit goes out
[47:53] of a man walks in dry places seek your
[47:56] threat what he's coming out of your
[47:57] inward house out of your inward house
[48:01] out of that heart that we've been
[48:03] talking about that now there's a new
[48:06] spirit put in there and we're gonna read
[48:07] what brother Branham says about that but
[48:09] let's get into sanctification with with
[48:12] Abram chapter 15 let's go
[48:15] see the journey of Abram now remember
[48:17] this is Abram and after these things
[48:19] after you've come out of justification
[48:22] you should know when you enter into
[48:24] sanctification because that unclean
[48:26] spirit goes out you have new desires you
[48:32] have new feelings you have you have more
[48:36] of a want to to do the right thing
[48:39] because all that's gone now you should
[48:43] feel like that and I told you in my
[48:45] journey of sanctification I believe I
[48:49] was forgiven of my sins but I went back
[48:51] to the water to be baptized now the
[48:53] water has nothing to do with it
[48:54] physically if I understand that even on
[48:57] the internet that physical water can't
[49:00] wash your sins away the blood of Jesus
[49:02] Christ is the only thing that wash your
[49:04] sins away but you do like he said in
[49:08] Ezekiel I'm gonna clean you up by the
[49:11] washing of the water of the word in the
[49:13] New Testament but then he says he's
[49:15] gonna wash you with clean water what
[49:17] what is clean water clean water is what
[49:19] you hear did you hear clean this out
[49:21] there no you did not hear cleanness in
[49:25] the world no the only thing you hear
[49:28] clean is here I'm not saying this
[49:30] building but in when you come into
[49:32] reading your Bible studying the message
[49:35] of the hour coming in here and preaching
[49:37] coming in here the messages that's clean
[49:40] water that's water that is washing you
[49:43] and you should feel I felt I had to I
[49:46] felt I need to be read baptized so I
[49:48] went we went to the bar to the water in
[49:50] January which was quite warm but anyway
[49:54] when I came out of the water man I just
[49:56] tingled all over and I felt so empty you
[49:58] said you feel empty yeah I felt empty at
[50:00] that time because your your symbolism of
[50:04] water baptism as you die and whatever
[50:07] goes down there you need to leave down
[50:10] there I don't want if you come back up
[50:14] with the same thing you went down with
[50:15] you just got wet physically but if you
[50:20] say God I'm gonna go and I'm going to
[50:22] that's why how many times have I told
[50:23] you what do we do when we go to
[50:25] baptizing we're going to a funeral
[50:27] something's gotta
[50:29] we're gonna bury them in Baptism and
[50:33] can't bring them up in what the Bible
[50:34] say newness of life and walk in newness
[50:38] of life that's what Abram was doing he
[50:40] started walking after these things the
[50:43] word of the Lord capital L Ord that
[50:46] theophany came unto Abram in a vision
[50:48] now he's showing him a vision he's
[50:51] expanding his sight now he's come to him
[50:54] in a vision
[50:55] fear not Abram I am thy shield and thy
[51:00] exceeding great reward and Abram said
[51:04] Lord God what will they'll give me
[51:07] seeing I go childless he's reminding God
[51:10] of what he promised him oh I like that
[51:13] brother Brahma he tells us many times he
[51:15] said God don't mind you reminding him of
[51:18] his promises he likes for you to remind
[51:20] him of what he's already said about us
[51:22] he loves for you to quote the Bible I
[51:25] don't think he likes me to quote
[51:26] anything else you know quote quote the
[51:29] promises back to him what will that give
[51:32] me seeing I go childless because
[51:34] remember in your journey as Abram you
[51:36] become a Christian you start doing the
[51:40] things of God but you theirs you don't
[51:41] understand all the intricacies of of how
[51:44] Jesus came and preached and you just
[51:47] know that he died for your sins
[51:50] right we're not we're not worth
[51:53] theologians when we walk in
[51:54] justification and part of sanctification
[51:56] now words are struggling to stay alive
[51:59] and then we're just struggling to
[52:01] understand that's why Jesus said he said
[52:04] come unto me all ye that labor heavy
[52:06] laden and I'll give you rest
[52:07] I believe on the Lord Jesus Christ the
[52:09] scripture says and thou shalt be saved
[52:11] that's pretty simple but remember Abram
[52:15] has to become Abraham because the
[52:18] promise that was a promise give to Abram
[52:20] but I'm gonna read you here in a minute
[52:21] where God gives a promise to Abraham and
[52:23] at that point Abraham knows the whole
[52:26] story then because God just told him get
[52:29] up and move I'm gonna bless you I'm
[52:31] gonna blot it you gonna have a lot of
[52:32] children he never told him where he was
[52:34] going to end up he never told him it was
[52:37] going to be with Sarah not Sarah
[52:39] Enoch God never told him that why
[52:42] don't want to pile all this on top of
[52:43] you he knows you're human he knows
[52:46] you're gonna have problems in life so
[52:50] you're not gonna load you up with
[52:51] anything but blessings to begin with but
[52:56] now remember that's a certain time in
[52:57] your life that God's gonna come to you
[52:59] and say look take that promise kid that
[53:01] I give you and you take him up on that
[53:04] mountain and you sacrificing that's your
[53:10] only promise son take thy son thine only
[53:12] son Abraham and take him up there what
[53:15] find out if you're obedient enough to
[53:19] continue this journey we'll get into
[53:20] that with with adoption but we got to
[53:24] get through just Fanta fication here
[53:26] it's only two o'clock we just starting
[53:27] service and man we're here too for
[53:31] anyway so anyway and all the people at
[53:35] home are going why does it matter put on
[53:37] some more coffee get the popcorn out and
[53:42] that's really ok as long as you listen
[53:45] and Abram said Lord God want will thou
[53:48] give me seeing I go childless in the
[53:49] steward of my houses this eliazar of
[53:52] damascus memory Eliezer comes up and
[53:54] helps him in the process of finding a
[53:58] bride
[53:58] hello freising so Eleazar he's saying oh
[54:04] I've got this Eliezer I but that's all I
[54:06] got but remember this le ESR is going to
[54:09] find a bride for Isaac later on in the
[54:11] journey
[54:12] so let's don't forget that Eliezer and
[54:14] Abram said Behold to me thou it's given
[54:17] no seed and lo one born in my house is
[54:20] mine heir but it wasn't his because look
[54:23] he says behold the word of the Lord came
[54:25] to him saying this shall not be thine
[54:26] heir I'm not talking about this one that
[54:30] old nature you were born with that old
[54:33] house that thing that lived in you you
[54:36] gotta get rid of that's not your heir
[54:40] hey man the Bible tells us that you will
[54:46] not be part of the bondwoman you'll be
[54:48] part of the free woman the free woman
[54:50] was Sarah which is going to be turning
[54:51] to Sarah behold the word Lord came unto
[54:53] him saying this shall not be thine
[54:56] but he that shook already called him he
[54:59] he that shall come forth out of thine
[55:02] own bowels Shelby's on there so now
[55:04] Abram says it's gonna come from me it's
[55:09] not something born in my house it's not
[55:12] any of my old friends or my old devil
[55:15] it's gonna come out of me
[55:19] what'd I tell you the other day the
[55:21] Bible says out of your belly will flow
[55:24] rivers of living water the one coming
[55:27] out of their own bowels bowel shopping
[55:28] but I remember he didn't say it's gonna
[55:30] be with Sarah either it that's that
[55:31] point so he's given he's given Abram
[55:34] revelation just like he's given to us a
[55:36] little at a time
[55:38] hey man there's a lot of things we don't
[55:42] understand but now we should be able to
[55:43] understand it now in our Christian walk
[55:45] we should be Abraham able to understand
[55:48] what's going on and he brought him forth
[55:50] abroad and said look now toward heaven
[55:51] he keeps showing this to Abram that look
[55:54] all this whole world is yours if thou be
[55:58] able to number him so shall thy seed be
[56:00] and he believed in the Lord and who is
[56:06] that he that he is God counted it to
[56:10] Abram for righteousness even in my
[56:13] journey of sanctification I'm coming to
[56:16] a place that God is reminding me of all
[56:19] the promises that he started out with
[56:22] amen I am the Lord that brought you how
[56:25] many times has God even now and I hope
[56:29] we do that now even even as we're not
[56:31] all assembled I hope though he has taken
[56:33] you back he has taken me back to my
[56:35] journey when I began to make sure that
[56:40] I'm okay God knows he's okay but I want
[56:42] to make sure I'm okay
[56:43] I want to check up a little bit Abram
[56:45] look back it's okay to look back to see
[56:48] that let's don't look back and want to
[56:50] go back
[56:51] Abram didn't go back he looked back but
[56:53] the Lord said look I'm the Lord that
[56:56] brought thee out of the earth the
[56:58] Chaldees and of course that's the first
[56:59] thing God spoke to him was while he was
[57:01] right there to give thee this land he
[57:05] had to call him out to get him to this
[57:07] land
[57:08] to inherit it and he said Lord God
[57:09] mm-hmm whereby shall I know that I shall
[57:12] inherit it and he said unto him take me
[57:14] an heifer of three years old now what's
[57:15] he doing now watch we remember what
[57:17] brother Brown said about this this whole
[57:20] journey of Abram has got to come to a
[57:24] place that when you get into
[57:26] sanctification and we'll read it a
[57:28] little bit but I'm gonna read this that
[57:30] Abram is gonna have to learn to make
[57:32] sacrifices that he didn't learn to make
[57:35] Abram is gonna have to learn and and
[57:38] look what he does he takes a heifer of
[57:40] three years old and if she go to three
[57:42] years old remember if she goat is used
[57:45] for an ignorance offering I've got that
[57:46] in my Bible and I really like that
[57:48] because even if you you plead ignorance
[57:50] God says you still got a sacrifice you
[57:52] got to do
[57:53] numbers verse numbers 15 verse 27 says
[57:57] that is an ignorance offering you bring
[57:58] a she-goat to offer him and a ram of
[58:02] three years old brother Graham said look
[58:03] at the threes Turtledove and a young
[58:06] pigeon a Turtledove and a pigeon was
[58:08] given because of healing you'll hear
[58:12] that brother bran will tell us that it
[58:14] took a prophet to tell us that how you
[58:15] gonna do that for you to keep looking at
[58:17] like that but the healing of the
[58:19] Turtledove and a young pigeon is is they
[58:21] didn't tear it apart now they totally
[58:23] twisted the head off but it was because
[58:25] of healing and we'll look at that in
[58:26] just a little bit and he took him to him
[58:28] all these and divided them in the mist
[58:31] and laid each piece one against another
[58:33] but two Birds divided he not and that's
[58:35] where brother berm tells us - for the
[58:37] divine healing showing divine healing
[58:39] can come your broken body can be healed
[58:43] alright and when the fowls came down now
[58:45] love there's going to be fowls come back
[58:48] into your life can we say foul spirits
[58:55] those were fo ul but with a little play
[58:59] of words this the fowls came down in
[59:01] Abram what Abram being in his journey he
[59:06] drove them away why because remember in
[59:09] sanctification the unclean spirit goes
[59:11] out but now the Bible tells you the
[59:12] unclean spirit goes out walks and drop
[59:14] place seek his rest find its nun that's
[59:16] in Luke I believe it is will somebody
[59:18] help me with it that's in the Book of
[59:19] Luke
[59:21] somewhere in this into Testaments and
[59:23] then that unclean spirit is going to
[59:25] come back that foul old spirit is going
[59:28] to come right back and try to enter in
[59:30] and it says enter into my house because
[59:31] God has a possessed you yet
[59:33] you've been possessed still by the devil
[59:35] but it's going out of there and he
[59:39] divided them into myths and when the
[59:41] files came down Abram drove him away and
[59:43] when the Sun was going down brother I'm
[59:44] sitting in the evening time
[59:46] a deep sleep fell upon Abram and a
[59:49] horror of great darkness fell upon him
[59:51] and he said unto Abram now this is while
[59:53] Abram is in a deep sleep and he said
[59:56] unto Abram know of a surety that thy
[59:58] seed shall be a stranger in the land
[1:00:00] that is not theirs now we know that he's
[1:00:03] telling us now that that is Israel
[1:00:06] there's going to be 400 years in the
[1:00:09] land of Egypt everybody got that same
[1:00:11] man but but how can we spiritually apply
[1:00:15] that you and I your seed shall be in a
[1:00:18] strange land listen when you get born
[1:00:20] again everything out there strange so
[1:00:24] he's heading toward insane - even in
[1:00:26] sanctification when the unclean spirit
[1:00:28] goes out you don't act like that unclean
[1:00:31] spirit no more and all these things are
[1:00:34] strange in the world they're just
[1:00:35] strangers ain't that right I hope in
[1:00:38] your life you know one thing for sure
[1:00:39] that under when you got sanctified by
[1:00:42] the washing of the water of the word
[1:00:44] every Sunday and every winds and every
[1:00:46] time you match-play and every time you
[1:00:47] converse with your brothers and sisters
[1:00:49] that God is washing you and that those
[1:00:51] fowls are being driven out but now we're
[1:00:58] talking about the inside guy right now
[1:01:00] and we're talking about God giving you a
[1:01:02] new spirit to be able to even talk to
[1:01:05] God we'll get to that in just a minute
[1:01:07] where brother BAM tells us now so he's
[1:01:09] so look you're gonna be a stranger in a
[1:01:11] land that's not yours there's I mean and
[1:01:14] shall serve them and they shall afflict
[1:01:16] in 400 years that's when physical Israel
[1:01:19] went down to Egypt and within bondage
[1:01:21] for 400 years and then that nation whom
[1:01:24] I serve I'll judge and then he keeps
[1:01:27] going on down but look right here verse
[1:01:29] 17
[1:01:32] it came to pass that when the Sun went
[1:01:35] down and it was dark and behold a
[1:01:37] smoking furnace and a burning lamp that
[1:01:39] passed through those pieces remember
[1:01:41] that light that light from watch what
[1:01:43] the prophet of God tells us but your
[1:01:45] brother Brahim tells us and that's true
[1:01:47] God even in justification but in
[1:01:49] sanctification God still going well you
[1:01:51] deserve hell what you've done you
[1:01:54] deserve help you're not my child yet
[1:01:57] yeah you're you're my child in my mind I
[1:02:00] know that but you don't know that
[1:02:03] seeing God's mind he knew exactly what
[1:02:06] Abraham was going to do at the end of
[1:02:09] his journey but Abram did not because
[1:02:11] Abram standing there going I'm Abram
[1:02:14] I've got a wife I've lived with for 60
[1:02:17] something years she's barren we've had
[1:02:20] relations for all that length the time
[1:02:22] when we've never had a kid right and I'm
[1:02:25] supposed to be that you can't count it
[1:02:27] for the sand on the sea you can't count
[1:02:29] my hairs and I've got one heir and this
[1:02:32] Eliezer and he wasn't even born from me
[1:02:35] because the way he was looking at his
[1:02:37] Abram was going to give his ownership
[1:02:40] till Eleazar because he did have a
[1:02:42] children that's what he just said back
[1:02:43] up there we'll be ready my heir that was
[1:02:46] born in my own house well it was born of
[1:02:47] a servant I guess it wasn't born of him
[1:02:49] but anyway look in the same day the Lord
[1:02:52] made a covenant with Abram saying look
[1:02:54] watch he comes right back and says unto
[1:02:57] thy seed have I given this land from the
[1:02:59] river of Egypt to the great river of the
[1:03:01] river Euphrates the key nuts and the ice
[1:03:03] and the ice and the ice and the amur ox
[1:03:05] and the jebusites and like I said
[1:03:07] Sundays and the web sites all right so
[1:03:10] now here's the point that I want to make
[1:03:12] real quick what does Sarah I mean Sarah
[1:03:19] means contentious all right she's a
[1:03:22] contentious woman and watch what happens
[1:03:25] in your walk of sanctification when the
[1:03:28] unclean spirit goes out the devil
[1:03:30] they're still gonna talk to you so we're
[1:03:34] gonna make Sarah the devil because the
[1:03:38] devil heard God tell you about a plan
[1:03:43] right yes
[1:03:45] right in that beginning he said I'm
[1:03:48] gonna bless you and I'm gonna give you
[1:03:50] children and I'm gonna give you this and
[1:03:52] not in the other well sir I must have
[1:03:55] got a different revelation then what God
[1:03:59] had a man because she's going look she
[1:04:05] had a handmaid an Egyptian now this
[1:04:06] ain't part of the plan this is the
[1:04:10] permissive wheel coming in not the
[1:04:13] perfect will of God
[1:04:14] perfect will of God Abram didn't know
[1:04:16] company was still able I'm telling you
[1:04:22] when you get born again you should know
[1:04:24] the perfect will of God now whether you
[1:04:25] do it or not George cause but but now
[1:04:27] under sanctification you really don't
[1:04:29] you may say I'm gonna do this and I
[1:04:32] think this is the right thing to do and
[1:04:34] I'm gonna go down this path and you go
[1:04:38] remember God's nose are the best yeses
[1:04:41] you'll ever get all right cuz if God
[1:04:44] tells you no he knows that if you go
[1:04:46] past here you're gonna really mess up so
[1:04:50] reevaluate what you've been thinking and
[1:04:52] go in another direction that's
[1:04:54] physically in that or naturally in
[1:04:55] spirit but when you're born again we
[1:04:57] should not have these if you look in
[1:04:59] this whole bottom line of this look at
[1:05:02] Abram he just really don't know where to
[1:05:04] go he don't have a rudder he's got a
[1:05:07] boat he's got water but he don't have a
[1:05:10] rudder
[1:05:11] what's the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is
[1:05:13] our rudder if it moves this way that's
[1:05:17] the way you move he didn't have that
[1:05:19] rudder yet he's kind of just fumbling
[1:05:21] through life and then all of a sudden
[1:05:22] his beautiful wife says I got it figured
[1:05:26] out we need to go in that direction and
[1:05:30] she's so convincing that Abram says ok
[1:05:35] right so self-centered to Abraham behold
[1:05:38] now the LORD have to restrain me from
[1:05:40] bearing she's telling she just like the
[1:05:43] devil the devil blames the Lord on
[1:05:45] everything you know the devil don't
[1:05:47] blame himself listen the devil don't say
[1:05:49] I made you do that
[1:05:50] no he said now now listen didn't happen
[1:05:54] in the garden Eve Eve I know you got a
[1:05:57] blessing
[1:05:58] I was there when Genesis one came apart
[1:06:00] there when God said let us make man in
[1:06:03] our own image and have dominion over the
[1:06:05] sin let's multiply replenish the earth
[1:06:09] same spirit was on Sarah well I got this
[1:06:14] new program Abram Adam here's the way we
[1:06:18] need to do it cuz they don't look like
[1:06:21] we're getting anything done right here
[1:06:23] and that the way it has been in your
[1:06:25] life a lot of times my life I know it's
[1:06:27] been that way you sit there and grind
[1:06:30] your wheels and you get nowhere
[1:06:31] why because it's not the perfect will of
[1:06:34] God if we're look the footsteps of the
[1:06:38] righteous are order of the Lord if you
[1:06:39] go in one direction and you're just
[1:06:40] sitting there spinning your wheels goes
[1:06:42] different way that may not be the
[1:06:44] perfect will of God but like brother
[1:06:45] Dale says long a long time ago
[1:06:47] God will let you work under permissive
[1:06:49] well because you're a free moral agent
[1:06:52] but there's somewhere it's got to work
[1:06:55] back to the perfect because this right
[1:06:56] here works right back to the perfect
[1:06:58] will of God he uses the same two people
[1:07:03] he doesn't switch players he uses the
[1:07:08] same Abram and Sarah to turn them into
[1:07:12] Abraham and Sarah to bring forth the
[1:07:16] promise but right here we get a little
[1:07:19] bit mixed up in sanctification because
[1:07:21] we hadn't got that rudder the Holy Ghost
[1:07:24] the guide brother Graham coaches the
[1:07:26] guide right because the Bible says he'll
[1:07:29] lead you and guide you into all truth
[1:07:30] I'm gonna send you the Holy Ghost right
[1:07:31] mm-hmm
[1:07:32] and Sarah I sent a neighbor behold now
[1:07:34] the LORD hath restrained me from bearing
[1:07:35] blame don't Lord I pray thee go in unto
[1:07:39] my maid it may be that I may obtain
[1:07:41] children by her no that's not the
[1:07:43] promise but God allowed it to happen
[1:07:47] what to bring something in called
[1:07:50] Ishmael because you always got to have
[1:07:52] good and evil watch and Sarah Abraham's
[1:07:57] wife took Hagar her made and she was in
[1:07:59] an Egyptian brought a little of the
[1:08:03] world back in huh after Abram had dwelt
[1:08:08] ten years in the land of Canaan oh he
[1:08:11] was enjoying it
[1:08:12] self no of a sudden the devil comes back
[1:08:13] in because the unclean spirit going out
[1:08:15] and now he's coming back
[1:08:16] that was the devil's listen the devil is
[1:08:19] a master at manipulation a master he
[1:08:23] says okay I can't work this way out but
[1:08:25] I got a little gap that's what brother
[1:08:26] Graham said about Eve
[1:08:29] he found that little gap he found her
[1:08:30] little weakness and he went right to it
[1:08:32] same way with this Dussehra she's
[1:08:36] telling Abram now look after he'd been
[1:08:40] ten years in the land of Canaan and gave
[1:08:43] her to husband Abram to be his wife and
[1:08:46] he went in unto her and she conceived
[1:08:48] when she saw that she had conceived her
[1:08:50] mistress was despised in her eyes
[1:08:52] now look Sarah brings this is how the
[1:08:56] devil works he brings in his plan and he
[1:09:00] gives you his plan okay and it works but
[1:09:06] he's not satisfied with that Sarah
[1:09:09] outstandings Abraham my wrong be upon
[1:09:11] thee I think she's listened to be real
[1:09:16] on it I think physically she's getting
[1:09:19] back at him for sending her to Egypt to
[1:09:21] try to marry the Hitchin you know
[1:09:23] shipping her off my wrong be upon me I
[1:09:26] have given my maiden to thy bosom in
[1:09:28] which she saw this she had conceived I
[1:09:30] was despised in her eyes the Lord judge
[1:09:32] between me and thee but Abram said look
[1:09:35] Abram said unto Sarah behold I made as
[1:09:38] in thy hand do to her as it pleases thee
[1:09:40] and when Sarah dealt hardly what she did
[1:09:42] she sent her out she separated hmm but
[1:09:50] now remember the angel of the Lord
[1:09:53] didn't forget this Union a permissive
[1:09:58] will there was a child brought forth and
[1:10:01] then after a long time we see that Abram
[1:10:07] become Abraham he even says oh that
[1:10:09] Ishmael may live before you he still
[1:10:12] don't have the full revelation of the
[1:10:14] word just like all of us we don't have
[1:10:16] the full revelation of the word yet but
[1:10:18] we're walking right all right so any way
[1:10:21] to save time that's
[1:10:26] let's go to verse 12 now this is the
[1:10:28] promise God God tone said look he'll be
[1:10:30] a wild man his hand will be against
[1:10:33] every man that's over there now brother
[1:10:36] you know this talks about Iran and Iraq
[1:10:38] and the different ones
[1:10:39] that's Ishmael's kids they're always
[1:10:41] against the promise kids or Israel the
[1:10:45] natural promise his hand will be against
[1:10:47] every man and every man's hand against
[1:10:49] him and he shall dwell in the presence
[1:10:50] of all his brethren and she called the
[1:10:53] name of the Lord just spoken now Garden
[1:10:54] City have a okay we're for the well was
[1:10:57] called whatever that is and hagar bear
[1:11:00] abraham a son and abraham called his
[1:11:02] abraham's one and named him Ishmael yes
[1:11:07] and Abram was eighty-six years old when
[1:11:10] Hagar bare Ishmael de Braun for score
[1:11:13] four to eight eighty six years old when
[1:11:18] Hagar bare Ishmael Abraham Abram now
[1:11:20] look Genesis 17 tell you what let's stop
[1:11:24] breath in let's read what brother Aaron
[1:11:26] says about this real quiz everybody ok
[1:11:28] we all right nobody's trying to fall
[1:11:30] asleep yet
[1:11:33] if you'll stick a big enough piece of
[1:11:35] candy in your mouth
[1:11:37] we may have to pray for you for choking
[1:11:39] but you won't go to sleep alright look
[1:11:43] let's go to quote number two you're good
[1:11:48] there you go what's close now that he's
[1:11:51] explaining what brother what brother
[1:11:54] Abram is going through now he calls him
[1:11:56] Abraham but remember he's still Abram
[1:11:58] what's close now then when he came down
[1:11:59] the Holy Spirit to talk to Abram in the
[1:12:02] garden out there where he was laying on
[1:12:04] the hill he put Abram to sleep no
[1:12:06] Abraham or Abram you haven't got one
[1:12:08] thing to do alright you lay here now and
[1:12:11] Abram went to sleep you're out of the
[1:12:13] picture and next thing now what's God to
[1:12:15] do he's confirming and giving an
[1:12:18] evidence because remember when he waked
[1:12:19] sabor him up he still tells him I'm
[1:12:21] making a covenant between us hey you got
[1:12:24] to do these things right here listen
[1:12:28] excuse me listen if you want to be
[1:12:30] healed
[1:12:31] how he's gonna do it then Abram then
[1:12:33] Abram I'm shutting you out of the
[1:12:35] picture
[1:12:38] I'm putting you to sleep then before
[1:12:43] Abraham came a black thickness every
[1:12:45] sinner deserves to go to hell blackness
[1:12:47] then after that of smoking burning
[1:12:49] furnace every sinner deserves Abraham
[1:12:52] that's what you deserve but beyond that
[1:12:54] one a little white light now like I said
[1:12:56] last Sunday that's that little white
[1:12:58] light that follows you all the days of
[1:13:00] your life
[1:13:01] remember redeemed have angels you don't
[1:13:05] know us there and boy some of the things
[1:13:08] I did he probably like brother Brown
[1:13:10] said he blessed a lot but he was there
[1:13:13] guiding you because God knows what you
[1:13:15] gonna do God knows you're gonna continue
[1:13:17] on or he know she's not you're gonna
[1:13:19] continue on and he'll just leave God
[1:13:24] we're all were special people but we all
[1:13:26] came the same way we all had the same
[1:13:29] experience we all came to so we all had
[1:13:31] to make a choice to become a Christian I
[1:13:34] couldn't help but being a Christian some
[1:13:36] people say uh I was a little different
[1:13:38] that and if you're really dig down into
[1:13:42] their life yeah they had them they had
[1:13:45] that one day Abram had to choose to stay
[1:13:49] there with life or send that lot out of
[1:13:51] here
[1:13:52] same way with right here guard it now
[1:13:54] God's saying to Abram I'm fixing to do
[1:13:58] the work you're not gonna your your
[1:14:00] works or nothing because God's the one
[1:14:03] that's doing this
[1:14:04] Abram that's what you deserve but beyond
[1:14:06] that one a little white light that
[1:14:09] little white light went right between
[1:14:11] those pieces of sacrifice because
[1:14:14] remember a sanctification is cleaned and
[1:14:16] set aside for service what made is real
[1:14:18] clean the sacrifices a man the
[1:14:23] sacrifices is what made Israel clean and
[1:14:25] that's what he's under now he's showing
[1:14:27] him though that that white light is
[1:14:29] still there the white light moving
[1:14:31] showing making a confirmation and I
[1:14:36] believe it and you look in your journey
[1:14:37] of sanctification as God comes closer to
[1:14:39] you he does confirm a lot of things he
[1:14:42] confirms the covenant that he made with
[1:14:44] you all right making a confirmation
[1:14:46] showing to Abram that he would do
[1:14:48] someday through his seed Isaac bringing
[1:14:51] in Christ for the supreme sacrifice
[1:14:53] everybody got that say man alright
[1:14:56] number three this is the hidden life in
[1:14:58] Christ you've seen people that was nice
[1:15:02] but you just couldn't hardly stand to be
[1:15:04] around them there's something about them
[1:15:05] they got a creative power around them it
[1:15:07] just seems to be different I'd like to
[1:15:09] stop here if it was possible and tell
[1:15:11] you some things on that you're a little
[1:15:13] creator yourself and you are because
[1:15:16] what he said he'd give you a new spirit
[1:15:18] now that spirit isn't God's Spirit
[1:15:21] that's your spirit God gives you a new
[1:15:25] spirit then he says I'll put my spirit
[1:15:27] in him but the thing God has to do is
[1:15:30] give you a new spirit to make your
[1:15:32] nature a little more gentle now I'm not
[1:15:35] completely burning down because God
[1:15:36] hadn't come in there yet remember you're
[1:15:39] cleaned and set aside not put in service
[1:15:41] the jar has still got the lid off so
[1:15:44] that unclean spirit can go right back
[1:15:46] down in that jar but when God seals you
[1:15:48] by the Holy Ghost he seals itself in and
[1:15:51] seals the jar all right then he puts you
[1:15:54] in service like brother Brown said you
[1:15:57] see that where brother Brown said a
[1:15:59] preacher should not be preaching without
[1:16:00] being baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:16:02] Christ Wow how about that Wow
[1:16:07] but the thing God has to do is give you
[1:16:10] a new spirit make your nature a little
[1:16:12] more gentle and settle down or he
[1:16:14] couldn't even live with you now remember
[1:16:16] he's fixing to dwell inside of you not
[1:16:17] with you inside you so he's got to get
[1:16:22] you fixed up now you can't do that
[1:16:23] that's what he was telling Abram you
[1:16:25] can't fix yourself up I'm going to just
[1:16:29] lay you down and kill you alright so he
[1:16:33] has to get you fixed up before he can
[1:16:35] come in I'll give you a new spirit then
[1:16:37] you take him anywhere you go you go all
[1:16:41] kinds of places he's got to get you
[1:16:44] fixed so you can entertain him right
[1:16:48] when you were in the bars when you were
[1:16:50] all doing the things of the world
[1:16:51] you weren't entertaining God you're
[1:16:55] entertaining the other guy all right all
[1:16:58] right number four Intervale I love this
[1:16:59] I love this message notice you put a new
[1:17:03] spirit God had
[1:17:04] to give you a new spirit or you couldn't
[1:17:07] even get along with him Wow
[1:17:09] you can't get along with yourself that
[1:17:12] old devil spirit you had in you we all
[1:17:15] had one yeah yeah and you got to
[1:17:21] remember when that leaves - I think you
[1:17:23] better cause you unclean spirits gotta
[1:17:25] go remembered Dwight Moody says God will
[1:17:28] fill those who are not full of theirself
[1:17:30] all right so he's got to put a new
[1:17:33] spirit in you so you can get along with
[1:17:35] his spirit amen I will put a new spirit
[1:17:39] in them and I will put my spirit in them
[1:17:41] now that's what we're fixing to talk
[1:17:42] about now in a minute with the baptism
[1:17:45] of the Holy Ghost and he said after he's
[1:17:47] given you a new spirit that's you don't
[1:17:51] get it confused with God's Spirit it's
[1:17:53] not it's your new spirit so you can get
[1:17:56] along with the Holy Spirit if he ever
[1:17:58] gives it to you hmm if he ever gives it
[1:18:02] to you so that's what you do when you
[1:18:05] come under sanctification that's okay
[1:18:07] you can go on when you come up to
[1:18:09] sanctification you you become brother
[1:18:12] Graham says it's a religious order what
[1:18:13] you become more religious or more
[1:18:15] wanting to do what God tells us to do
[1:18:19] all right because you unclean spirits
[1:18:21] driving and driven out but now look it's
[1:18:23] like brother Dale was saying this
[1:18:24] morning I've always said this that is
[1:18:26] the that is the most dangerous place you
[1:18:29] can be because look if Abram would have
[1:18:32] said if everyone would have woke up from
[1:18:33] that vision and said okay God I'm all
[1:18:36] right I'm just gonna stay right here and
[1:18:39] I'm gonna keep Sarah and Hagar and
[1:18:42] Ishmael and this is the promise and
[1:18:46] Satan's going yeah man
[1:18:49] you feel good you got the right you know
[1:18:52] you still got your wife and you're still
[1:18:54] got you still going to the same church
[1:18:55] and you still got the same pastor and
[1:18:57] you believe the message because brother
[1:18:59] Branham was a prophet and we believe we
[1:19:01] can recite Malachi 4 Luke 17 30
[1:19:03] revelation 10 7 the devil loves that boy
[1:19:09] out the devil hates is is that he can't
[1:19:12] get back in that inner guy God's got it
[1:19:15] sealed and he can't get back in
[1:19:18] and then you come to another level of
[1:19:20] now that God's gonna meet you and you're
[1:19:22] gonna have to do something that really
[1:19:24] hurts the bay okay we're all we're all
[1:19:28] men here today we know what circumcision
[1:19:31] is and and he had circumcision at 90
[1:19:34] something years old so so but but now
[1:19:36] that's a type of us though coming to a
[1:19:39] place to where you you got to make a
[1:19:41] decision all that old skin that oh what
[1:19:46] a demmick
[1:19:49] so let's read that now let's go to
[1:19:52] Genesis chapter 17 that's ok maybe about
[1:19:55] 30 more minutes is everybody all right
[1:19:57] we okay we're not not even supper time
[1:20:01] yet I'm sorry for those of you online
[1:20:05] we don't eat dinner at 6 o'clock it
[1:20:08] wasn't called the Lord's dinner it was
[1:20:11] called the Lord's Supper and it was in
[1:20:12] the evening ok it's the weave supper o
[1:20:16] southerners have always been rocked we
[1:20:19] did hey man we eat dinner in the middle
[1:20:21] of the day we eat supper at night
[1:20:23] College it was the Lord's Supper not the
[1:20:26] Lord's dinner whatever that had to do
[1:20:28] with anything it just probably made some
[1:20:30] people mad Genesis chapter 17 verse 1
[1:20:33] now look and when Abram was ninety years
[1:20:36] old in 999 years old you think you're
[1:20:41] too old for God to deal with you know I
[1:20:43] don't think so and listen truly why did
[1:20:47] if he's the father by faith and he's the
[1:20:50] one that we're supposed to look at why
[1:20:51] did God let him go ninety nine years
[1:20:54] before he comes into this new birth that
[1:20:57] we're talking about why do you let you
[1:21:00] get thirty years old well I'm just
[1:21:02] saying what he let you get twenty-five
[1:21:04] years why do you let remember this and I
[1:21:07] when I see this I always remember when
[1:21:09] brother Branham went across the curtain
[1:21:11] of time and that woman came up and
[1:21:12] hugged his neck and said my precious
[1:21:14] brother and said the angel looked at him
[1:21:16] and said don't you remember her well I
[1:21:18] mean he really no he didn't remember him
[1:21:20] remember her because she was 90
[1:21:22] something years old when she got saved
[1:21:23] in his meeting she was a 90 something
[1:21:25] year old woman probably all you know
[1:21:27] / but now she was a brand-new young
[1:21:29] woman I think about that you know that
[1:21:31] my whole jar yeah
[1:21:33] come to the Lord he'll give you a new
[1:21:36] birth and when she received that new
[1:21:39] birth that 90 something years old she
[1:21:41] was just as young as she was when she
[1:21:42] walked across the curtain of time and
[1:21:44] hugged that prophet's neck at 18 to 20
[1:21:46] years old I wish we'd realize that that
[1:21:48] when we received the new birth that
[1:21:50] changes us in our soul that changes us
[1:21:52] everybody back to the same age 18 to 20
[1:21:55] years old we're all young that's why we
[1:21:57] should be vibrant inside whether our
[1:21:59] body hurts or not we should be inside as
[1:22:02] brother Dale says a revival now his
[1:22:04] revival is not in that 80 year old body
[1:22:09] my 60 year old body
[1:22:11] the revival is the inside guy denying
[1:22:16] what the outside yeah but God to show
[1:22:19] example to all of us he let Abram live a
[1:22:22] good long life before he brings him to
[1:22:24] circumcision and when Abram was ninety
[1:22:28] and nine years old there's bear with me
[1:22:30] a few minutes the Lord appeared appeared
[1:22:32] to Abram now remember a capital LRD
[1:22:34] appeared to Abram and said unto him I am
[1:22:37] the Almighty God walk before and they
[1:22:40] never told him to be perfect before
[1:22:42] because he cuz he couldn't and you can't
[1:22:46] but he is now requiring to walk before
[1:22:50] me and be thou perfect or in other words
[1:22:53] I'm gonna bring you to come this
[1:22:55] completion of bringing this promise to
[1:22:59] pass everybody got that
[1:23:02] because he told him I will way back
[1:23:05] yonder when he was like 70 years old he
[1:23:08] said I I will do this I will do that I
[1:23:10] will do this but I watch he comes right
[1:23:13] back in Genesis 17 and starts all over
[1:23:19] and verse 6 we'll get to in a minute
[1:23:20] hang right there I will I will I will I
[1:23:22] will
[1:23:23] listen if God's not doing this it's not
[1:23:26] worth it come on people if God's not
[1:23:30] doing this all it's not worth it cuz he
[1:23:31] who's doing it there's only two spirits
[1:23:35] we don't want to be religious at this
[1:23:38] time now we want to be a boring
[1:23:40] in son and daughter of God we don't want
[1:23:43] to be religious religious people are
[1:23:45] going go to hell because what is a
[1:23:48] religion mean covering we don't want to
[1:23:52] make our own cover and that's what got
[1:23:54] Adam and Eve in trouble they made their
[1:23:55] own religion of their own covering God
[1:23:58] took his covering rip the skins off of
[1:24:02] them lambs and throw them in there said
[1:24:04] look that ain't enough clothes you got
[1:24:05] on put this on so I'm when you get born
[1:24:09] again women and men you'll put on
[1:24:10] clothes not take them off and said unto
[1:24:15] him I am the Almighty God walk before me
[1:24:18] and be thou perfect and I will make my
[1:24:21] covenant between me and thee and I will
[1:24:23] multiply thee exceedingly hoytsman watch
[1:24:27] him now to me I'm gonna be a little more
[1:24:30] dramatic because God is listen when you
[1:24:35] come to the new birth to me that's I
[1:24:40] believe God rejoices more when you
[1:24:44] receive him the inward man his spirit
[1:24:48] then he did when he created the world
[1:24:50] because he created the world knowing
[1:24:53] that if he didn't create the world you
[1:24:54] couldn't be standing here today and
[1:24:56] receive the new birth so I believe
[1:24:59] that's his joy tell my somebody
[1:25:01] screaming and shouting remember the
[1:25:03] Bible says they rejoiced a man they
[1:25:06] rejoice and I'm sure he had a good time
[1:25:08] making all the stars and everything but
[1:25:10] what was he making them for his motive
[1:25:12] his last part his whole motive was
[1:25:15] making that so they can come inside of
[1:25:17] you that's why one that's why we need to
[1:25:21] see what brother Dale was talking about
[1:25:22] he's coming the son of man physically
[1:25:25] flesh man is not going to be on the
[1:25:27] earth he's physically flesh man in your
[1:25:30] earth the son of man is the collective
[1:25:33] body of Jesus Christ and the Word was
[1:25:36] made flesh and dwelt among us I'm
[1:25:39] talking about that today so now watch
[1:25:42] God's gonna get some dramatic here and
[1:25:45] Abram fell on his face and God talked
[1:25:48] with him saying as for me behold my
[1:25:52] covenant is with thee
[1:25:54] now thou shalt be a father of many
[1:25:57] nations now he told him that long time
[1:25:59] before but he's fixing to what reveal
[1:26:02] how he's going to do it neither shall
[1:26:07] thy name any more be called Abram hi
[1:26:09] Father but thy name shall be Abraham in
[1:26:14] other words your name was whatever it
[1:26:15] was sinner now I'm gonna make you a
[1:26:23] saint or a Christian that's our new name
[1:26:26] brother I'm told us what our new name
[1:26:28] was we're mrs. Jesus Christ now listen
[1:26:32] you don't want a different name before
[1:26:33] this happened to you you were satisfied
[1:26:35] with people going hey Louise let's go
[1:26:36] have a beer but see when they picked the
[1:26:39] phone um says hey Louise let's go have a
[1:26:40] beer now Lewis goes ain't at home I
[1:26:43] don't know who that guy in right I don't
[1:26:46] know who that guy is you and you don't
[1:26:47] that thoughts not even in your mind a
[1:26:50] man neither shalt thou name any more be
[1:26:55] called Abram but thy name shall be
[1:26:56] Abraham for a father what does Abraham
[1:27:00] mean what father of many nations because
[1:27:05] look folks when you're walking even in
[1:27:08] justification and sanctification brother
[1:27:10] Branham says you don't even preach until
[1:27:12] you get baptized but he said don't
[1:27:15] preach until you've had that back side
[1:27:17] of the desert experience which is the
[1:27:19] new birth listen and I'm gonna say this
[1:27:24] and I ain't I ain't gonna back down one
[1:27:25] bit we got a lot of preachers in this
[1:27:28] message that are just sanctified that
[1:27:30] they think they got the Holy Ghost
[1:27:31] because they got this and that and the
[1:27:33] other feeling or brother branham I'm
[1:27:37] just saying because you can't preach and
[1:27:40] continue on in the life they're in
[1:27:42] that's what I'm saying
[1:27:43] watch the life brother Brent says always
[1:27:46] watch the life the life takes them away
[1:27:49] more away more away from God all these
[1:27:51] people to think you can have polygamy
[1:27:53] and that's what the message is all about
[1:27:54] and you have all these things that's not
[1:27:56] they can't be born again
[1:27:58] that's not say listen now that's not
[1:28:01] saying though you can't get caught in
[1:28:02] error but you got to come out cuz God
[1:28:04] promised you
[1:28:06] you would walk in truth but I believe
[1:28:09] people are in the sanctified condition
[1:28:10] think they got the Holy Ghost and God
[1:28:12] shows them truth and they turn it down
[1:28:14] that makes them worse
[1:28:17] Jesus Jesus and not get anything Lord
[1:28:21] have I not come and cast out Devils
[1:28:23] spoken preach the gospel Judas what
[1:28:28] Judas is gonna walk up and say hey you
[1:28:29] give me a spirit to preach and cast out
[1:28:33] Devils and Jesus is gonna say but you
[1:28:38] denied me you were doing good until that
[1:28:42] because all these others you know even
[1:28:44] you know it's kind of strange because
[1:28:46] the devil always argue so so Judas is
[1:28:50] gonna say well now you call Peter devil
[1:28:53] you call Peter said Satan get out of me
[1:28:55] Peter denied you're three times but you
[1:28:57] know what God's gonna tell him Peter
[1:29:00] went to Pentecost Peter went and receive
[1:29:04] what I was telling you I was going to
[1:29:06] send you if you would have waited long
[1:29:08] enough i'ma give it to you same way with
[1:29:12] all of us that's why the Bible says
[1:29:15] depart from me I never knew you
[1:29:17] that word kne w is not knowing that's
[1:29:22] new as in relationship between Adam knew
[1:29:25] his wife Eve so that's an intimate
[1:29:26] relationship of intercourse amen and
[1:29:31] that's what we're doing we're having
[1:29:32] intercourse with what's the problem with
[1:29:34] with us saying we have intercourse with
[1:29:37] Jesus Christ but what the problem is is
[1:29:38] people go well I'm making love with
[1:29:40] Jesus Christ and it's not him it's the
[1:29:43] devil right that's what they're doing
[1:29:46] that's why you come up and say Lord if I
[1:29:48] not cast out devils in other words have
[1:29:49] I not Jesus said no you never need me
[1:29:53] you might a knew of me you might have
[1:29:56] got sanctified but you let that unclean
[1:29:58] spirit come back in you and drive you in
[1:30:01] another direction I don't know how I got
[1:30:04] off on that but not somebody needed it
[1:30:06] maybe neither shall thy name anymore be
[1:30:09] called sinner but thy name shall be
[1:30:10] called Christian because look in Abram
[1:30:13] how many children did he have one wild
[1:30:16] kid right one wild kid that's the same
[1:30:20] way
[1:30:20] you and me but when you get born again
[1:30:22] look at the spiritual multiplication of
[1:30:25] getting born again once you get born
[1:30:27] again have the right birth have the
[1:30:30] right child you can stand behind the
[1:30:33] pulpit preachers you can go to work
[1:30:35] laity and you can produce children of
[1:30:38] God but God's not gonna let you do that
[1:30:42] in sanctification because the seeds not
[1:30:45] there it's coming but it's not there yet
[1:30:48] sure you can talk about God but remember
[1:30:50] I remember a lot of times I tried to
[1:30:53] explain a lot of things about the
[1:30:54] message and I knew I was sanctified I
[1:30:55] knew I hadn't received in your birth but
[1:30:57] I can't put things together because
[1:30:58] they'd ask you a question you go I don't
[1:31:01] got to the Prophet take homework I don't
[1:31:06] work well in explain this one gun
[1:31:09] in a prophet no you gotta have your own
[1:31:12] revelation so Abraham Abram is now
[1:31:16] getting a revelation from God that I can
[1:31:22] do it now and he's gonna tell him who is
[1:31:26] he gonna do it with with his bride the
[1:31:31] right bride hey man let's brides brides
[1:31:35] churches hey guards hey guards and a
[1:31:36] guard
[1:31:37] but they'll come one bride Sarah and
[1:31:40] you're gonna have the promised child
[1:31:42] neither shall thy name any more be
[1:31:44] called Abram but thy name shall be
[1:31:46] Abraham for a father that just makes me
[1:31:49] feel good when you see you know
[1:31:52] Abraham's kind of blunt kind of Abram
[1:31:55] but when you say Abraham brother Graham
[1:31:57] said he gave Abram part of his name the
[1:31:59] ham the am the I am Jehovah and all that
[1:32:03] you know Abraham one two three four five
[1:32:09] six seven letters now man
[1:32:13] now Abram is five that's okay but seven
[1:32:17] is completion five is Grace listen you
[1:32:21] walk under grace even still now but you
[1:32:23] really walk under grace under
[1:32:24] justification sanctification cuz you
[1:32:26] make a lot of mistakes and God has grace
[1:32:29] for you but now there's a time when
[1:32:31] it's gonna look at you just like your
[1:32:32] daddy did one time and said son grow up
[1:32:35] and Ocampo would see that big ol hen go
[1:32:38] right up inside the backi ahead that's
[1:32:41] what God does he finally says hey he's
[1:32:43] gonna do it to you he's gonna hey yeah I
[1:32:47] got watch what he did to Abram he's hey
[1:32:52] you're gonna be able to him now listen
[1:32:55] to me and I will - here comes our Wells
[1:32:58] again verse 6 I told you 6 7 8 and I
[1:33:01] will make the exceeding fruitful and I
[1:33:07] will make nations of thee and Kings
[1:33:09] shall come out of them listen I believe
[1:33:12] the tone of God's voice changed because
[1:33:16] the tone of God's voice changed when I
[1:33:18] became born-again
[1:33:19] his voice was more clear his voice was
[1:33:23] more precise his voice was more it had a
[1:33:27] lot more clarity in it and you knew God
[1:33:30] was talking to you and I will make the
[1:33:33] exceeding fruitful I'm sure guards over
[1:33:35] there Wow
[1:33:37] I'm gonna make you finally come to the
[1:33:39] place I want you to be 99 years I've
[1:33:42] been waiting on this two thousand years
[1:33:47] I've been waiting on this team shall
[1:33:51] come out of thee and I will establish my
[1:33:53] covenant between me and thee and thy
[1:33:56] seed after thee in their generations I
[1:33:58] finally got the right people here and I
[1:34:04] seed after thee in their generations for
[1:34:07] an everlasting covenant to be a God unto
[1:34:10] thee and to thy seed after the end I
[1:34:13] will give unto thee and to thy seed
[1:34:16] after thee the land
[1:34:18] we're in you're a stranger this world is
[1:34:22] not my home
[1:34:23] I'm just the passing through my
[1:34:26] treasures are laid up somewhere beyond
[1:34:28] the blue but guess what
[1:34:29] where's him treasures gonna fall back to
[1:34:31] right here I love our brother Brahim
[1:34:34] said Abraham was looking for a city
[1:34:35] whose builder and maker of God and he
[1:34:37] was walking right on top of them where
[1:34:39] the state is gonna step down and man you
[1:34:42] know what though he didn't have enough
[1:34:43] in Revelation he had a revelation of the
[1:34:46] time but he was looking for that place
[1:34:49] and it was right under his feet because
[1:34:51] he had took a little profit to come and
[1:34:52] say look that mountains gonna push up
[1:34:54] right where Abraham had talked about a
[1:34:57] GPS through brother Branham he told him
[1:35:02] sitting right there were the mountains
[1:35:05] gonna push up remember the Bible said
[1:35:07] the mountains gonna push you up cleave
[1:35:08] from one side of the other
[1:35:09] he said it's right there in the same
[1:35:10] spot where Abraham met Mel Cassidy right
[1:35:13] here what we're fixing to talk about
[1:35:14] very spot where that city is going to
[1:35:17] come down and that's what we're gonna
[1:35:18] live what about what about a positioning
[1:35:21] system that's God's positioning system
[1:35:23] not GPS like we have that tells you to
[1:35:27] recalculate God's never recalculated in
[1:35:30] this life and I will establish my
[1:35:32] covenant between me and thee and thy
[1:35:33] seed after thee in their generations for
[1:35:35] an everlasting covenant to be a God unto
[1:35:37] you as I seed after thee and I will give
[1:35:39] unto thee in thy seed after thee the
[1:35:41] land where there are stranger all the
[1:35:43] land of canaan for an everlasting
[1:35:44] possession and I will be their God and
[1:35:48] God said unto Abraham thou shalt keep my
[1:35:51] covenant therefore thou and thy seed
[1:35:54] after thee in their generations this is
[1:35:57] my covenant my covenant which you shall
[1:36:04] keep between me and you and thy seed
[1:36:06] after thee every man child among you
[1:36:08] shall be circumcised and you shall
[1:36:11] circumcise the flesh your foreskin now
[1:36:13] remember this had to be a type of what
[1:36:16] happens in our new birth right because
[1:36:20] what God is telling them now and we know
[1:36:22] being males and if you're circumcised or
[1:36:27] not I don't mind a big difference
[1:36:28] remember that question popped up in the
[1:36:30] New Testament and Paul says it's the
[1:36:33] heart circumcision of the heart doesn't
[1:36:35] matter if you circumcision is physical
[1:36:39] or not you know here but what does that
[1:36:41] do that cuts off the foreskin are the
[1:36:45] excess flesh and it's something that
[1:36:48] Abram did God didn't circumcise Abram
[1:36:52] Abraham circumcised this up now look
[1:36:55] watch this though we're
[1:36:57] gonna put you and it shall be a token of
[1:37:01] a covenant cuz remember Abraham got a
[1:37:04] promise and then I'm going to be a
[1:37:07] little graphic here but what happens is
[1:37:09] is that separated the people all the way
[1:37:13] to Jesus this time in other words you
[1:37:17] could say were you frontal they all kind
[1:37:18] of looked alike where you from they go
[1:37:20] take them out behind the tree and Oh
[1:37:23] you're of Abraham's lineage you're of
[1:37:25] Abraham you're you're separated people
[1:37:28] right so they could physically show just
[1:37:31] like you and I now physically show not
[1:37:34] by that way but we physically showing
[1:37:36] this thing that we've had circumcision
[1:37:40] but look when it happens on the eighth
[1:37:44] day not the seventh day brother mom
[1:37:48] always explains that we're in we're all
[1:37:50] in the new birth we're in the eighth day
[1:37:52] in eternity we're in the eighth day or
[1:37:56] eight days old shall be circumcised
[1:37:58] among you every man child now we know
[1:38:00] what all that is but it's the taking off
[1:38:06] of the foreskin now watch this verse
[1:38:08] eleven right here and you shall
[1:38:10] circumcise the flesh your foreskin it
[1:38:11] shall be a token because remember God
[1:38:15] couldn't enter them in the new birth the
[1:38:18] baptism of the Holy Ghost couldn't enter
[1:38:20] into the man in the Old Testament
[1:38:22] everybody got that but to be a separated
[1:38:26] people he let them do that
[1:38:28] in their natural foreskins so that they
[1:38:30] can be a separated people everybody got
[1:38:33] that I may about I hope everybody sees
[1:38:35] that that that's why God did that all
[1:38:39] right it was a physical showing of what
[1:38:43] lineage they would come from Abraham and
[1:38:45] his house and the lineage we come from
[1:38:48] God we show the circumcision by the
[1:38:50] circumcision of the heart what we're
[1:38:52] separated people not by the physical
[1:38:54] body because we can go walk out here in
[1:38:56] the world if we look just like the world
[1:38:58] not exactly but we do we are human men
[1:39:01] and women but what happens to us though
[1:39:03] when we when we received the new birth
[1:39:05] we start moving over this way now you
[1:39:09] don't do it you should never separate
[1:39:11] your
[1:39:11] but God separates the people okay God
[1:39:14] separates the people the excess foreskin
[1:39:19] amen so he that is eight days old so
[1:39:22] here we come where it you get
[1:39:23] circumcised on the eighth day right now
[1:39:26] it's a wonderful thing to know that that
[1:39:29] that's after seven days before seven
[1:39:36] days physically your blood doesn't have
[1:39:38] the clotting agent in it so God knew and
[1:39:42] even typed that out in your own human
[1:39:45] body and that was back then when they
[1:39:48] didn't have cauterization now they do it
[1:39:49] now where they cauterize it with with
[1:39:53] heat but back then they didn't have that
[1:39:55] well you were circumcised and you were
[1:39:57] circumcised before seven days you'd
[1:39:59] bleed out because they had no way to
[1:40:00] stop it you had no coagulation in your
[1:40:02] blood or whatever that was if Sarah was
[1:40:04] here she could tell us
[1:40:05] vitamin K or whatever that is it
[1:40:07] collects your blood you don't your body
[1:40:09] doesn't develop it till after the
[1:40:11] seventh day so God knowing that but
[1:40:13] typing everything's in the Bible putting
[1:40:15] us in the eighth day saying it has to be
[1:40:18] eight days before the man's circumcise
[1:40:20] all right every man child he just bought
[1:40:24] in the house he they just brought bought
[1:40:26] with our money much needs to be
[1:40:27] circumcised no word to everybody
[1:40:28] attached to Abraham now and my covenant
[1:40:33] shall be in your flesh for an
[1:40:34] everlasting now look it's not an eternal
[1:40:36] covenant
[1:40:36] it's an everlasting covenant because
[1:40:38] when Jesus came and Paul comes up and
[1:40:41] says look it doesn't matter if you
[1:40:42] physically circumcised or not you gotta
[1:40:44] be circumcised inside inside now that
[1:40:48] had to be an outside showing and the
[1:40:51] uncircumcised man child whose flesh of
[1:40:52] his foreskin is not circumcised look
[1:40:54] that soul shall be cut off from his
[1:40:56] people they physically didn't let that
[1:40:58] kid in the in in the religious
[1:41:00] ceremonies it meant that much to God at
[1:41:02] that time to separate them from that but
[1:41:04] look how it shows all the way down to
[1:41:05] now listen you walk through
[1:41:08] justification you walk through
[1:41:10] sanctification we see now that people is
[1:41:12] walked in sanctification they're now
[1:41:14] turning away because you can't receive
[1:41:16] the new birth as in Romans tells us you
[1:41:18] can't fall away from being born again
[1:41:21] and if there's Baptist online I'm sorry
[1:41:25] but this once saved always saying that's
[1:41:27] not right in the condition they tell you
[1:41:31] because they just tell you to you've
[1:41:32] made a decision at 10 years old that
[1:41:34] doesn't matter if you have 14 wives and
[1:41:36] drink beer and smoke cigarettes right
[1:41:38] here swear God no it's a walk god only
[1:41:42] moved on Abraham after he went through
[1:41:45] all this journey to 99 years now look
[1:41:50] they'll be cut off and have broken my
[1:41:54] covenant so if you're not born again
[1:41:57] today you've broken the Covenant of God
[1:41:59] because the Covenant of God is to
[1:42:01] promise that you will receive the
[1:42:04] baptism of Holy Ghost eternal life in
[1:42:06] your soul and God said unto Abraham as
[1:42:10] for Sarah thy wife he's not forgetting
[1:42:13] there thou shalt not call her
[1:42:15] contentious anymore but Sarah Sarah
[1:42:20] shall be her name Sarah not Sarah now
[1:42:31] look what he says about him I'm tryin to
[1:42:32] skip on through here
[1:42:34] her name is now princess but watching in
[1:42:37] verse 16 yeah and I will bless her now
[1:42:41] he's not said a word about her you hear
[1:42:46] me
[1:42:47] he's not said one word about putting her
[1:42:49] in the promise or anything he said April
[1:42:50] I'll bless you Abram I'll bless you
[1:42:53] Avery my bless you now he brings the
[1:42:55] wife in now she's been there the whole
[1:42:58] time
[1:42:58] but she was Sarah she needed a name
[1:43:02] change hey man are we getting a we
[1:43:05] getting a spiritual application of this
[1:43:06] and without going through it cuz this
[1:43:08] 256 now and I will bless her and give
[1:43:10] the son of her so here we go the promise
[1:43:15] is now God says I'm going to take you
[1:43:17] change your name Sarah you're Sarah
[1:43:20] you're now Sarah and now the promise
[1:43:22] sons going between be between the both
[1:43:24] of you and Sarah looks at him and goes
[1:43:26] I'm 99 I will bless her and she shall be
[1:43:34] a mother of Nations the kings of people
[1:43:36] shall come out of her
[1:43:38] then Abraham fell on his face and
[1:43:39] laughed now remember how the story goes
[1:43:43] Abraham laughs out loud at God and
[1:43:48] doesn't get in trouble but Sarah
[1:43:51] sniggers in her heart
[1:43:52] a little bit later on in the journey and
[1:43:53] brother Brown said if it wasn't for
[1:43:55] Abraham God would have killed Sarah you
[1:43:58] see how much God Revere's his promise
[1:44:01] his promise had to come through Abraham
[1:44:04] and Sarah not sinner Lewis Christian
[1:44:10] Lewis not sinners AK car snuggle brain
[1:44:15] thing through that the devil is bringing
[1:44:18] things through that but the Christian
[1:44:20] that then Abraham fell on his face and
[1:44:24] laughed and said in his heart shall a
[1:44:26] child be born unto him that is 100 years
[1:44:27] old and see how Sarah that is 19 years
[1:44:30] old bear and Abraham said unto God oh
[1:44:34] that Ishmael might live before the he
[1:44:36] still got a little bit I mean you know
[1:44:39] he he's coming to a place of the new
[1:44:41] birth but it's right it even at your
[1:44:43] first walk you have problems but God's
[1:44:48] gonna keep going though and watch God's
[1:44:50] not gonna kill you
[1:44:51] he's not gonna kill Sarah for thinking
[1:44:54] these different things because he knows
[1:44:57] the end and God said Sarah hey ever HAP
[1:45:02] remember what I said
[1:45:04] come fall hey boy listen what
[1:45:06] I'm saying talking to you
[1:45:08] that's what brother Dale does every
[1:45:10] Sunday hey talking to you God says
[1:45:13] through brother Dale hey talking to you
[1:45:16] and God said look Abraham I'm all riding
[1:45:21] down for you he did he's roping the
[1:45:23] Bible he wrote it down for him look and
[1:45:27] God said Sarah your wife hope ain't no
[1:45:32] Sarah right now Sarah thy wife shall
[1:45:36] bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt
[1:45:40] call his name Isaac Abraham I'm gonna
[1:45:44] spill it all out for you and I will
[1:45:46] establish my covenant with him always
[1:45:50] move the cover
[1:45:51] now from just this to now brother Louise
[1:45:55] talks to brother so-and-so and he comes
[1:45:57] in and he shares the message with him
[1:46:00] and he shares eternal life with him and
[1:46:01] now the covenants going to this guy
[1:46:03] brother now started to church 12 people
[1:46:06] got a little over a hundred now not here
[1:46:09] today yeah but there's spiritual
[1:46:13] multiplication he said hey brother Dale
[1:46:16] I've called you to do something I've
[1:46:18] called you to be my spiritual multiplier
[1:46:24] and I want you to come to Lula and
[1:46:28] preach to the people and that's where
[1:46:30] the promise sons and daughters of God
[1:46:33] are going to come from and thou shalt
[1:46:36] call his name Isaac and I will establish
[1:46:37] my covenant with him for an everlasting
[1:46:39] covenant and with his seed after him and
[1:46:44] as for Ishmael
[1:46:46] I have heard thee behold I have blessed
[1:46:49] him hmm like brother Ram says he said
[1:46:54] God even in permissive will God bless
[1:46:56] you but he's got to work back to his
[1:46:58] perfect will because watch what he said
[1:47:02] look as for Ishmael I've heard thee I've
[1:47:05] heard these people that are foolish
[1:47:08] virgins I don't forget them and I'm not
[1:47:12] gonna forget them they're gonna be wild
[1:47:14] child they're not gonna go through what
[1:47:15] you're going through they're gonna have
[1:47:17] a lot of tribulation they're gonna have
[1:47:19] a lot of problems so Ishmael to me would
[1:47:21] type the people that get eternal life
[1:47:23] are the foolish virgin because he's not
[1:47:25] gonna forget him watch and I have
[1:47:26] blessed him and will make him fruitful
[1:47:30] and will multiply him exceedingly 12
[1:47:34] Prince's shall he beget and I will make
[1:47:35] him a great nation but I didn't make a
[1:47:40] covenant with him but my covenant will I
[1:47:45] establish with Isaac which Sarah shall
[1:47:48] bear unto thee at this set time in the
[1:47:51] next year and he left off talking with
[1:47:54] him because what God had to go get in
[1:47:56] some flesh
[1:48:00] he was talking to him in spirit forming
[1:48:02] the theophany of he's he left him he
[1:48:05] left off talking with him and God went
[1:48:07] up from Abraham now we see all these
[1:48:10] what happens here what's happened what's
[1:48:12] this and I'm gonna tell you this and let
[1:48:17] you make your own assumption look at
[1:48:19] verse 24 we up 20 let's read 23 and
[1:48:25] Abraham took Ishmael his son and all
[1:48:29] that were born in this house now this is
[1:48:30] the natural type because this will had
[1:48:32] to be he told him here plain his
[1:48:34] household and all that were bought with
[1:48:35] his money every male among men of
[1:48:37] Abraham's house and circumcised the
[1:48:39] flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame
[1:48:41] I now these were not children these were
[1:48:43] men and Abraham was ninety years old and
[1:48:49] nine when he was circumcised in the
[1:48:51] flesh of his foreskin now not to be so
[1:48:59] graphic but it's a real good type if all
[1:49:03] of you were circumcised right now
[1:49:06] tomorrow you'd walk different you'd have
[1:49:13] to heal but you'd walk different and
[1:49:15] that's what happens when you get born
[1:49:18] again you've walked different because
[1:49:22] God has given you something he's given
[1:49:25] you and put you in that covenant of
[1:49:27] promise when you receive the new birth
[1:49:29] sure you should have started in
[1:49:31] sanctification walking different but now
[1:49:33] that you come to the new birth there is
[1:49:35] no doubt that you gonna walk different
[1:49:38] if you circumcised yourself at ninety
[1:49:41] years old he circumcised itself Abraham
[1:49:44] did remember right there when he was
[1:49:46] circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin
[1:49:48] and his son was 13 when he was
[1:49:50] circumcised they all walk different you
[1:49:52] get born again you gonna walk different
[1:49:53] right and all the men of his house born
[1:49:56] in the house and bought with money of
[1:49:57] the stranger were circumcised with him
[1:49:59] they all walk different from that day
[1:50:01] forward and I think you know what let's
[1:50:05] just stop right there that's long I'd
[1:50:06] love to get to where but we'll stop
[1:50:09] right there it'll give me something else
[1:50:11] to preach later on but
[1:50:13] that's the new birth let's read now some
[1:50:17] of the quotes I'd like to get on to wear
[1:50:19] because remember you got to meet
[1:50:22] Melchizedek just like now remember he
[1:50:26] met Melchizedek and justification but
[1:50:28] remember you didn't see any of meat and
[1:50:30] milk hesitating sanctification right but
[1:50:35] here we come to the end of the journey
[1:50:37] not the end of his journey but we come
[1:50:38] to the part where we look go to Ezekiel
[1:50:41] 36 right where it says new birth Genesis
[1:50:43] 17 Ezekiel 36 that's what you need where
[1:50:45] you need to be right there God appears
[1:50:48] again and he's becoming intimate now
[1:50:52] we'll talk about that maybe next Sunday
[1:50:54] or whenever we come back where I will
[1:50:56] take you from among the heathen and
[1:50:58] gather you're a ball country now this is
[1:50:59] what we read to a little while ago but
[1:51:03] we're gonna go further with it because
[1:51:05] remember we're into the new birth now
[1:51:06] then will I sprinkle clean water upon
[1:51:09] you and you shall be clean from all your
[1:51:10] filthiness from your idols will I
[1:51:12] cleanse thee a new heart also will I
[1:51:14] give you in a new spirit now we're
[1:51:16] talking about that remember that new
[1:51:17] spirit is not the holy spirit well I put
[1:51:20] within you and I will take away the
[1:51:21] stony heart out of your flesh and I will
[1:51:23] give you a heart of flesh and I will put
[1:51:25] my spirit my spirit now that's Almighty
[1:51:31] God not a third person of a Trinity
[1:51:35] that's Almighty God Himself that I will
[1:51:38] put my spirit in the form of the holy
[1:51:41] spirit which we know it he's intro unity
[1:51:43] he is a Father Son and Holy Ghost but
[1:51:47] he's gonna put that spirit but the same
[1:51:49] person and cause you see to walk you
[1:51:54] gonna walk a little gingerly at first
[1:51:55] you gonna walk a little different that's
[1:51:57] why he made when he changed jacob's name
[1:52:00] to Israel he wrestled with God God
[1:52:02] smacked him on the inside of his thigh
[1:52:04] and he walked different he became a
[1:52:07] limping Prince you know whatever where
[1:52:09] he went I like what brother and he said
[1:52:11] everywhere he went
[1:52:12] he's asked what's wrong said well I met
[1:52:14] Dunn and I walked different after I met
[1:52:17] God I walked different in same way with
[1:52:19] you and I we walk different and I will
[1:52:22] put my spirit within you and cause you
[1:52:24] to walk in my statutes and you shall
[1:52:26] keep
[1:52:27] my judgments and do them you didn't do
[1:52:30] that up here
[1:52:33] you did it right here when my spirit
[1:52:36] went within you they eternal life the
[1:52:40] new birth right now if you Baptists or
[1:52:44] whatever one if you want to go to that
[1:52:45] part where you walk different and you
[1:52:47] don't do the things you used to do I'll
[1:52:49] go with you
[1:52:50] but not if you continue to do the things
[1:52:52] you've been doing what do you get saved
[1:52:55] from it's what I told that guy he's
[1:52:57] drinking a beer and cussing like a
[1:52:58] sailor and he said all I got saved not
[1:53:00] too long ago I said what'd you get saved
[1:53:01] from what did you get saved from to me
[1:53:05] if we were in a boat fishing and he was
[1:53:07] a bank president I ain't care didn't
[1:53:09] Bank it his bank but but I said look
[1:53:14] John if I'd knocked you out of the boat
[1:53:16] I said and you drowning I said I'm gonna
[1:53:22] save you by taking you from one position
[1:53:25] and putting you in the boat I said what
[1:53:26] you're telling me is is that God pulled
[1:53:28] you out of the water and you drove right
[1:53:30] back in yeah
[1:53:32] and every time you drown him huh no no
[1:53:37] our promise is it will walk different
[1:53:41] amen I'll put my spirit within you look
[1:53:46] at Brit number five will read these
[1:53:47] quotes and then we'll be done we'll
[1:53:50] really get into the new birthday and we
[1:53:51] can use the whole section next time
[1:53:54] hidden life with Christ 1956
[1:53:56] now the Bible fitter he would give us a
[1:53:58] new heart and he would give us a new
[1:54:00] spirit and many people even Pentecostal
[1:54:03] people and full gospel people has been
[1:54:05] deceived in that boy can you imagine how
[1:54:07] many of them went under the bench but
[1:54:12] the Baptist is going hot no he's talking
[1:54:16] to everybody you've been deceived by
[1:54:18] many times God said I'll give you a new
[1:54:20] spirit that wasn't his spirit that's
[1:54:23] your spirit then I will put my spirit in
[1:54:26] you I'll give you a new spirit then I'll
[1:54:29] put my spirit in you and many times you
[1:54:32] get the new spirit and think you've got
[1:54:34] the Holy Spirit and trusting upon
[1:54:37] emotions and signs and things when your
[1:54:40] life does
[1:54:41] it wake up my game well you gotta go
[1:54:51] okay when your life doesn't PV up to
[1:54:54] that look that word up with you now
[1:54:56] that's just a little raw but remember
[1:54:58] that's the truth many people that spirit
[1:55:01] I'm warning you the same way
[1:55:03] don't let that new spirit make you think
[1:55:06] it's the Holy Spirit God had to give you
[1:55:10] a new spirit to get along with his
[1:55:11] spirit well some people so mean they
[1:55:14] can't even get along with ourselves let
[1:55:16] alone with God if he'd come in that's
[1:55:19] right so doubtful and up and down God
[1:55:22] has to give you a new spirit give you a
[1:55:24] new nature so you can get along with his
[1:55:26] spirit when it comes in I man I hope you
[1:55:29] see that God gives you a new spirit for
[1:55:31] yourself then he puts his Holy Spirit in
[1:55:35] there to dwell with you and abide with
[1:55:38] you alright let's go to number six
[1:55:41] number six the impersonation of
[1:55:43] Christianity what a good name for a
[1:55:44] title
[1:55:45] now watch the Bible says I'll give you
[1:55:48] take the old stony heart and give you a
[1:55:49] heart of flesh tender-hearted then I'll
[1:55:52] give you a new spirit and then I'll put
[1:55:53] my spirit in you now watch his spirit
[1:55:56] was different from your new spirit and
[1:55:58] many people gets the new spirit and
[1:56:01] think they get the holy spirit they get
[1:56:04] feeling happy jump around maybe do a few
[1:56:06] things religiously and they think that
[1:56:09] they got the Holy Spirit oh no the Holy
[1:56:12] Spirit makes you act different like I
[1:56:13] said about circumcision it makes you
[1:56:14] walk different the Holy Spirit makes you
[1:56:16] think different the Holy Spirit is put
[1:56:19] right in the middle of your new spirit
[1:56:21] and your new spirit was put right in the
[1:56:24] middle of your new heart new heart new
[1:56:26] spirit Holy Spirit three men just like
[1:56:29] brother man told us we have the three
[1:56:31] men to the outside five senses middle
[1:56:34] five and one in the middle so he's
[1:56:36] putting it right there together the new
[1:56:37] heart the new spirit in the middle of
[1:56:40] the new heart and says God said I'll put
[1:56:42] my spirit in you now then God's Spirit
[1:56:45] sets right in the middle of your spirit
[1:56:47] your new spirit and then you don't have
[1:56:49] to go out a night like Miss Jones does I
[1:56:51] hope there's not somebody like that in
[1:56:53] here and like mr. Joe
[1:56:54] there's just something in you you just
[1:56:56] got the love of God so down in you to
[1:56:58] you just live it it isn't you it's
[1:57:01] something in you alright number seven
[1:57:05] this is last one and we'll then we'll
[1:57:06] stop right here number seven we get the
[1:57:10] right one why some people can't keep the
[1:57:13] victory now many times we try to make
[1:57:15] things just say well as soon as you get
[1:57:17] the new spirit you quit your stealing
[1:57:19] you quit your line things like that you
[1:57:20] say Oh hallelujah I got it
[1:57:22] you find out the first time anyone
[1:57:24] crosses your path a little bit old mercy
[1:57:26] what a difference sure you blow up like
[1:57:28] a frog eating buckshot but let me tell
[1:57:31] you brother that's the reason you never
[1:57:33] got God's Spirit that's true oh you say
[1:57:35] he stepped on my toes I'll just not put
[1:57:38] up with that alright what shows what you
[1:57:41] got in that shows what you got in you
[1:57:42] that's true I'll put a new spirit in you
[1:57:45] and then I'll put my spirit in you now
[1:57:47] the heart is the center of the emotions
[1:57:50] of the human being now not the thumping
[1:57:53] heart he's talking about the inner just
[1:57:55] like the core your heart is the middle
[1:57:58] of you that's exactly right so God puts
[1:58:00] a new heart in the middle of the old man
[1:58:03] all right there buddy got that that's
[1:58:05] the one he gets a new heart the pliable
[1:58:07] one then he puts a new spirit in the
[1:58:09] middle of the new spirit or heart and
[1:58:11] puts his spirit in the middle of the new
[1:58:15] spirit that explains that your memories
[1:58:20] and conscience are your see taste feel
[1:58:22] smell in here memories and consulate
[1:58:24] effects an imagination the spirit of man
[1:58:25] and the inside man is either full of the
[1:58:29] Holy Ghost are full of the devil you
[1:58:30] can't say it this there's no half
[1:58:32] there's no medium there's no I think I
[1:58:35] do I'll promise you one thing brothers
[1:58:38] and sisters the next day Abraham knew
[1:58:47] he'd been circumcised he knew it he was
[1:58:52] reminded of it every day hey man so
[1:58:57] that's the same thing about the Holy
[1:58:58] Ghost the Holy Ghost reminds you every
[1:59:00] day hey you're mine you're mine you
[1:59:03] don't walk like that and you're sure
[1:59:05] we're gonna get slapped on our hands
[1:59:07] we're gonna get all these there
[1:59:08] things that we made lean over to one
[1:59:10] side but you just that that desire of
[1:59:13] not doing it anymore is gone a man and
[1:59:18] then he takes that desire of that's why
[1:59:21] people heavenly days yeah musicians come
[1:59:24] I hope I don't say this wrong but there
[1:59:28] was a person in our in our post office
[1:59:32] and she was showing me the things that
[1:59:33] they had bought to put up to eat what
[1:59:37] was their wine beer and liquor I said
[1:59:45] y'all going on a liquid diet but that
[1:59:48] was what was important because see that
[1:59:49] fueled what they they thought they would
[1:59:51] need that to get through this they need
[1:59:55] they needed a spirit all right Kelly I
[1:59:58] hope you're not watching in but they
[2:00:01] needed the Holy Spirit because what that
[2:00:02] same desire that you human beings have
[2:00:05] that when we have fear and all these
[2:00:07] things that we have that same desire in
[2:00:09] the world outside is quenched with beer
[2:00:12] and alcohol or a beer and wine and
[2:00:14] liquor and they think that's going to
[2:00:16] take care of it but if they'll get the
[2:00:19] baptism of the holy spirit the real
[2:00:23] spirit let's stand our feet that spirit
[2:00:26] well what lasts for an eternity not for
[2:00:28] just what one night because look
[2:00:33] circumcision didn't last for just one
[2:00:35] day
[2:00:36] it was for the whole even we'll get into
[2:00:40] this next week because even when Abraham
[2:00:42] was changed back to a young man it went
[2:00:46] in Reverse process he was circumcised
[2:00:49] when he came back to young because
[2:00:51] listen if you don't get circumcised the
[2:00:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost you're not
[2:00:57] gonna get a new body a man because of
[2:01:02] the circumcision that you have had now
[2:01:04] in the flesh not the flesh but in what
[2:01:07] the baptism of the Holy Ghost then
[2:01:09] that's going to carry you to your body
[2:01:10] change and there you gonna be
[2:01:12] circumcised by the heart not by the
[2:01:14] other way but Abraham as he walked from
[2:01:16] then til the day he died he knew he had
[2:01:19] come to a place that
[2:01:21] he had made a decision and he had
[2:01:23] changed and that's what you and I got to
[2:01:25] come to see that God has changed us he's
[2:01:29] changing me the song says from glory to
[2:01:32] glory he's changing me amen
[2:01:36] we're heading toward the body changed
[2:01:38] folks and we'll but if you don't have if
[2:01:40] you're not circumcised you're not gonna
[2:01:44] have a body change that circumcision
[2:01:46] meant a lot back then spiritually it
[2:01:49] means a lot now because it means your
[2:01:51] eternal destination it meant Abraham's
[2:01:53] destination of where he was going and it
[2:01:55] means your eternal destination right now
[2:01:57] let's sing a song that's worship God for
[2:02:00] just a little while born again page 492
[2:02:03] page 492 born again there's really been
[2:02:13] a change in me
[2:02:18] born again
[2:02:21] just like Jesus's
[2:02:26] amen Oh born-again it all because of
[2:02:34] Calvary they manually that
[2:02:50] again man there's really baby it's your
[2:02:55] picture they broke Jimmy changing me
[2:02:57] name on him and gave him a never walk
[2:03:03] just like Jesus
[2:03:08] Oh born-again and all because of Calvary
[2:03:19] oh I'm so glad
[2:03:25] [Music]
[2:03:28] let's sing that for 89 there brother
[2:03:31] Luis right across to top Jesus be the
[2:03:33] lord of all not okay we test Kiev F if
[2:03:38] you need worship and maybe when you're
[2:03:47] there in your in your home Lord we pray
[2:03:51] if there's anybody that has a fear of
[2:03:53] this thing is coming on we pray that you
[2:03:56] would settle their fear Lord and change
[2:04:00] it into face that we're realized Lord
[2:04:03] that you've changed this line and that
[2:04:06] we love you for that Lord Jesus I
[2:04:10] surrender Jesus eyes
[2:04:19] [Music]
[2:04:55] you know we were in the service a long
[2:04:57] time ago it may have been Louisiana camp
[2:05:00] and the brother was singing that song
[2:05:02] and he said you know he says as a police
[2:05:06] officer he said this that's not
[2:05:08] surrender I know brother Dale can't lift
[2:05:12] this left shoulder but but look if you
[2:05:15] come up and the cop tells you to
[2:05:17] surrender and you're doing this right
[2:05:18] here you're gonna have an extra hole
[2:05:20] because they don't know what's behind
[2:05:22] here you have not surrender at all but
[2:05:25] if you got both that's why they tell you
[2:05:27] both hands up both hands out why because
[2:05:29] you've surrendered
[2:05:30] so let's sing it one more time and let's
[2:05:32] really surrender Jesus I surrender all
[2:05:38] hiding nothing we're hiding nothing
[2:05:40] Jesus sir
[2:05:43] oh Jesus you know the Bible says when
[2:06:19] that God had to leave Abraham they
[2:06:22] didn't leave him he's not gonna leave
[2:06:23] you to birth but you know what he had to
[2:06:24] do he had to go getting some human flesh
[2:06:27] and what happened it's a new birth you
[2:06:29] know one thing's for sure I know I got
[2:06:32] to get what I need from a man in human
[2:06:33] flesh standing right here talking
[2:06:38] outside down to Sunday School class so
[2:06:40] God just moves over and gets into human
[2:06:42] flesh and then we'll talk about that
[2:06:44] later then he meets Abraham in human
[2:06:47] flesh hey man so god bless you love you
[2:06:50] with the love of the Lord thank you all
[2:06:51] for coming
[2:06:52] and we'll do this like Sid Wednesday
[2:06:55] night same format same people
[2:06:58] nobody extra because we're doing it just
[2:07:00] like the way the government wants us to
[2:07:02] do at the moment and we will have

[2:07:17] pulpit and just pray if you don't feel
[2:07:20] good please don't come okay because
[2:07:23] listen sickness can get on this thing
[2:07:25] right here we're not immune from it but
[2:07:27] we pray we pray that God will keep that
[2:07:31] dome over us that protection like the
[2:07:34] land of goshen and like he did with the
[2:07:36] children of israel that when the plagues
[2:07:38] fell they were sitting in in total light
[2:07:42] and the whole world was in total
[2:07:43] darkness same God same God and he was
[2:07:48] just with the people then he's in us he
[2:07:52] was just with them now he's in us so we
[2:07:55] carry that light with us that like the
[2:07:56] Goshen so if all
[2:07:57] mine's clear let's bow our heads
[2:07:59] Heavenly Father we thank you for the
[2:08:01] state that you give us we think for the
[2:08:03] time that's allotted that we've come
[2:08:04] here Lord to serve you father in spirit
[2:08:06] and truth and we pray Lord that you
[2:08:08] would bind us closer together Lord let
[2:08:11] us look to you the author and finisher
[2:08:12] of our faith we know the world is trying
[2:08:15] their best to do what they can and we're
[2:08:17] going to let them do that they only know
[2:08:20] of physical drugs and physical things
[2:08:25] they can do but Lord we know that you
[2:08:27] work in a totally spiritual realm we
[2:08:29] know that you can go now to these
[2:08:31] different countries and as we we pray
[2:08:33] every day Lord you know that that we we
[2:08:35] pray the Lord that you'll that the
[2:08:37] sensor will run through this United

[2:09:11] the word you gave a spiritual insight so
[2:09:13] that we can see and understand what's
[2:09:14] going on Lord so I pray that we not fear

[2:09:20] that will not fear because we know
[2:09:21] what's coming next because you told us

[2:09:28] boat and we know that Lord when you turn
[2:09:32] it in one direction that's the way that
[2:09:33] boats got to go so I pray Lord that you
[2:09:35] would truly be the Lord of all of our
[2:09:37] hearts and that you'll put your spirit
[2:09:40] if somebody today is not born again that
