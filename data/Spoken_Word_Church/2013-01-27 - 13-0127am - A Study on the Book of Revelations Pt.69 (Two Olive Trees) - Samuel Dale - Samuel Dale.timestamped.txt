[0:14] thank you
[0:16] that our hearts and mind
[0:18] is in the place of being obedient to god
[0:23] he says that obedience
[0:25] is better than sacrifice

[0:32] and all things that we do according to
[0:34] his will

[0:43] let's pray
[0:45] lord jesus we thank you for this
[0:47] privilege to come together to worship
[0:50] lord those with like precious faith
[0:52] lord we pray that as we gather mother we
[0:55] all would be united
[0:57] and surrendering our hearts and
[0:59] minds and bodies unto you lord during
[1:01] this time of services
[1:03] lord we pray to these words lord we find
[1:06] a meaning and a place in our hearts
[1:08] and we suggest you remember brother
[1:10] dallas he prays and meditates forth lord
[1:13] we can receive lord we have not come
[1:16] together lord just to be together but
[1:18] love to receive a blessing from your

[1:31] romans
[1:33] chapter 13
[1:35] let every soul be subject unto the
[1:38] higher powers but there is no power but
[1:40] of god the powers that the
[1:44] powers that be ordained of god
[2:02] to good works but to the evil will thou
[2:05] not be afraid of the power do that which
[2:08] is good and thou shalt have praise of
[2:11] sins
[2:23] for he is the minister of god a reminder
[2:27] to execute wrath upon him
[2:31] wherefore you must
[2:33] needs be subject not only for wrath but
[2:36] also for countries
[2:50] runner therefore to all that deals
[2:52] tribute to whom tribute is due custom to
[2:55] whom custom
[2:57] fear to whom fear
[2:58] honor to whom honor
[3:10] for this i shall not commit adultery
[3:13] thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal
[3:16] i should not bear false witness thou
[3:18] shalt not covet
[3:20] and and if there be any other
[3:22] commandment it is briefly
[3:25] comprehended in this scene namely thou
[3:27] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[3:30] love work has no will to do
[3:33] therefore love is the fulfilling of the
[3:36] law
[3:38] and that knowing the time that is now
[3:42] it is high time to awake out of sleep
[3:45] but now is our salvation nearer than

[14:01] your word you come and speak your hearts
[14:04] in jesus name
[14:05] amen
[14:12] okay we'll go where we've been reading
[14:13] for quite a while from revelations 1.
[14:17] since the revelation of jesus christ
[14:19] which god gave unto him
[14:21] to show unto his servants things which
[14:23] must shortly come to pass
[14:25] and he sent and signified it by his
[14:27] angel unto his servant john
[14:29] who by record of the word of god and the
[14:31] testimony of jesus christ of all things
[14:33] that he saw
[14:35] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[14:37] hear the words of this prophecy
[14:39] and keep those things which are written
[14:40] therein
[14:42] for the time is at hand
[14:45] what is the time to understand right
[14:48] you find that quote again over in
[14:50] revelations 21 or 22.
[14:52] all right let's go to revelations 11
[14:54] because that's kind of where we've
[14:56] gotten up to
[14:57] and read just a few verses here maybe
[14:59] the first eight verses
[15:02] there was given a read like unto a rod
[15:04] and the angel
[15:05] given me a read like unto a rod
[15:08] and the angel stood
[15:10] saying rise and measure the temple of
[15:12] god and the altar and them that worship
[15:14] therein
[15:15] for the court which it but the court
[15:17] which is without the temple leave out
[15:19] and measure it not
[15:20] but it is given unto the gentiles and
[15:22] the holy cities
[15:24] shall they tread under foot 40 in two
[15:27] months all right remember that's the
[15:28] three and a half years we're going into
[15:30] the two witnesses
[15:32] and i will give power unto my two
[15:35] witnesses and they shall prophesy a
[15:37] thousand two hundred and three score
[15:39] days clothed in sackcloth
[15:41] these are the two olive trees and the
[15:43] two candlesticks
[15:45] standing before the god of the earth
[15:47] and if any man will hurt them fire
[15:49] preceded out of their mouth
[15:51] and divine their enemies and if any man
[15:54] will hurt them he must in this manner be
[15:56] killed
[15:57] these have power to shed heaven there
[15:59] right not in the days of their prophecy
[16:01] and have power over waters to turn them
[16:03] to blood and it's not the earth with all
[16:06] plagues as often as they will and when
[16:09] they shall have finished their testimony
[16:12] the beast that ascendeth out of the
[16:13] bottomless pit shall make war against
[16:15] them
[16:16] and shall overcome them and kill them
[16:19] and their dead bodies shall lie in the
[16:21] street of the great city which
[16:23] spiritually is called sodom and in egypt
[16:25] where also our lord was crucified you
[16:29] may be seated over that is blessing
[16:31] to the reading of the word
[16:37] now we've been
[16:39] in the book of revelations
[16:42] now for quite a while
[16:44] this makes i think about the 69th
[16:46] message
[16:47] so we're you can tell that we're very
[16:49] slow
[16:50] and uh you know moving on
[16:52] but we've covered up and come through
[16:55] taking this and we call it a study on
[16:57] the book of revelations
[16:59] and we just kind of take
[17:00] and we're just moving through the
[17:02] scriptures in the book of revelations to
[17:05] try to get an understanding
[17:08] and and knowing that
[17:10] we know for certainty the prophet
[17:12] describing it he said the rapture comes
[17:14] in revelations 4 1 as a type in john and
[17:18] he said but then the bride is not seen
[17:20] anymore
[17:22] until revelations 19 when we come riding
[17:24] back into the millennial reign
[17:27] and
[17:28] then we look at that and we say well
[17:29] what about this and what about that well
[17:32] that was his saying because that was the
[17:35] point because
[17:36] when we're reading the book of
[17:37] revelations
[17:40] then from revelations 4
[17:43] you go up into heaven revelations 5 then
[17:46] you see all of the things
[17:48] and remember even up until where we're
[17:50] at
[17:52] actually until you come to the 19th
[17:54] chapter that's why your prophet said it
[17:56] from revelation 4 1 to 19 is to israel
[18:00] because you see then that's when we ride
[18:02] back
[18:04] into the millennial reign
[18:07] all right
[18:08] and and that means that we're coming
[18:10] back to earth all of these other things
[18:11] are taking place on earth yes
[18:14] the seals break the things happening the
[18:17] the beasts the different this that the
[18:19] other
[18:20] but remember john is still up in heaven
[18:24] writing about these things
[18:26] and sending them back to
[18:28] you know the the uh
[18:30] earth as we would call it brother brown
[18:33] said he sent it back to the messenger in
[18:35] the end time to proclaim to the church
[18:39] because see john was concerned how he
[18:40] could get these things back but then he
[18:42] sees in revelations 10
[18:44] 1 but in the days of the voice of the
[18:46] seventh angel
[18:48] see he sees that that seventh church age
[18:50] messenger
[18:51] will be a prophet for the word of god to
[18:53] come to all right so we're in the point
[18:56] but now
[18:57] what we're doing is is taking these
[18:59] things that we see
[19:01] from revelations say four one five and
[19:04] all through there of talking to the
[19:06] bride in heaven
[19:08] and then going up to six and coming on
[19:11] through
[19:12] and now this past wednesday we covered
[19:15] the trumpets
[19:16] uh they're in the scriptures you know
[19:18] like the the uh the feast of the
[19:20] trumpets
[19:21] and knowing all of these things pertain
[19:24] to israel
[19:26] in their redemptive journey
[19:28] all right
[19:30] but the book is written to you and i
[19:32] right right
[19:33] see
[19:34] this is the book of redemption
[19:37] this is a complete plan of redemption
[19:40] this is the complete revelation of jesus
[19:42] christ
[19:43] and whether it be old testament or new
[19:46] testament
[19:47] it is still the revelation of jesus
[19:49] christ
[19:50] right now then that revelation of jesus
[19:53] christ is to be given to who
[19:55] to his bride amen
[19:58] so we get all of it like uh you know
[20:01] it's god said can i withhold anything
[20:03] from abraham that's right right see he's
[20:06] there of all things
[20:08] so we just told him everything
[20:10] and that's what we're trying to do is
[20:12] look at the things
[20:14] and see what these things have to do
[20:17] with us
[20:19] all right now in seeing what it deals
[20:22] with us it doesn't put us down
[20:25] i certainly don't want to be there in
[20:27] the tribulation to you
[20:29] thank god for that revelation that we
[20:30] don't have to go
[20:32] well i don't want to be there in
[20:33] armageddon i don't want to be there of
[20:35] all of those things and and see
[20:38] but now that is the physical happening
[20:41] or literal happenings under the seals
[20:43] that goes to israel seal number one they
[20:46] said to brother branham asked him a
[20:47] question the second thessalonians a man
[20:49] of sin sitting in the temple of god
[20:51] showing himself to be as god said does
[20:53] that fulfill the first seal they said
[20:54] yes
[20:56] all right that was just a straight blunt
[20:58] answer
[20:59] because why because there's no need of
[21:01] expressing it anymore
[21:03] i don't want to be here when the man of
[21:05] sin sits in the temple of god to you
[21:07] so then
[21:08] the literal happening of the seals
[21:13] is to israel
[21:15] the literal trumpets
[21:17] sounding the things is to israel right
[21:21] but the spiritual revelation is to you
[21:23] and i and then
[21:24] all right see that we can see
[21:27] and find our place and like i've told
[21:29] you i love the book of revelations
[21:31] because to me it's the bride's book
[21:35] if you want to know where we're at read
[21:36] the book of revelation
[21:39] if you want to know what's going on in
[21:40] the world read the newspaper
[21:48] still
[21:49] the thing of what i'm getting at is
[21:52] we look at the bible and think well well
[21:55] that's got to be us
[21:56] no that's not us
[21:59] in a lot of extent
[22:01] it's about someone else
[22:04] but then we see what it means to us
[22:08] right see we get the complete plan of
[22:10] redemption we stand here even now seeing
[22:13] what will happen in the tribulation when
[22:16] it comes what will happen at armageddon
[22:18] what will happen that the uh platoon
[22:21] judgment right the millennium
[22:24] the things and even what will happen
[22:27] when we enter the future home we see
[22:29] that while we're here
[22:30] that's right so it's a wonderful book
[22:32] yes
[22:34] that we can read
[22:35] but then we said but now wait just a
[22:37] minute now now
[22:39] i thought revelation 10 was seven was
[22:43] was in our day that's true but you know
[22:45] that's got to go to israel right
[22:49] come on this message goes to israel not
[22:52] rhetoric now this message goes to israel
[22:56] through two prophets
[22:57] which this message is the message of the
[23:00] entire bible right now i don't believe
[23:02] they'll go over there and take a quote
[23:03] book
[23:05] you know i don't believe it that way i
[23:08] don't believe that whatever say run
[23:09] around and say so and so they don't have
[23:11] to do that they'll tell them of their
[23:13] own personal revelation right you go
[23:16] into the seventh seal and you'll find
[23:17] the prophet telling you what they
[23:18] preached and they'll tell them so you
[23:20] missed it
[23:21] yeah but this bride has received it
[23:24] and become the wife
[23:26] and everything's over with it let me see
[23:28] all right
[23:29] now in doing that then we can look at it
[23:33] and see the literal things
[23:36] and then see what those literal things
[23:40] has to do with looking at us in the
[23:42] spiritual right just like the the
[23:45] prophet covering from the feast of the
[23:46] trumpets is trying to get across our
[23:48] wednesday
[23:49] that
[23:51] he said all these trumpets sound to
[23:52] israel
[23:54] he said it was natural
[23:57] calling her out of egypt
[24:00] all right
[24:01] it was a natural thing calling them out
[24:03] of egypt that's right
[24:05] all right he said now in the spiritual
[24:12] the in the spiritual
[24:13] to israel now
[24:15] is calling them to
[24:17] the atonement amen
[24:20] but you remember what he said now
[24:22] leviticus 16
[24:24] is the literal atonement where they
[24:26] offered the first
[24:28] not the first sacrifice because you know
[24:30] obtaining them i mean they will offer to
[24:32] sacrifice but the first setting forth of
[24:35] moses
[24:36] and the the offering of the sacrifice
[24:39] was
[24:40] leviticus 16.
[24:43] all right
[24:44] do you realize then that the calling out
[24:46] of egypt
[24:49] the liberal trumpets sounded
[24:52] to call them out to bring them to that
[24:54] atonement of leviticus 16. praise god
[24:57] all right now you're following me yes
[24:59] see that way you see the literal calling
[25:01] you out and then you see the spiritual
[25:03] right now in the end time it's not a
[25:05] killing again
[25:10] this is not re-killing us
[25:12] you would be wrong to go that way so the
[25:14] prophet says what
[25:15] he said leviticus 16 is it killing the
[25:18] atonement he said leviticus 23
[25:23] is the mourning for the keel yes
[25:26] it's not a re-killing of the lamb
[25:28] that's right see moses tried to do that
[25:30] messed up
[25:32] right right he was told to smite the
[25:34] rock
[25:36] he smoked a rock all right that would
[25:38] type the killing of the lamb
[25:41] under leviticus 16 which would top
[25:43] christ
[25:45] in him having to be crucified all right
[25:48] but when moses smoked the rock this
[25:50] second time
[25:52] see he broke every scripture in the
[25:54] bible the prophet said set up a new
[25:56] thing
[25:58] all right
[26:00] he said then they would have to be in
[26:02] the end time
[26:04] a morning for the kill it would have to
[26:06] be leviticus 23. see if you understand
[26:09] what i'm saying
[26:10] that if moses hadn't smoked that rock if
[26:13] those things hadn't happened you
[26:14] wouldn't needed a leviticus 23.
[26:18] you wouldn't have no bride either
[26:19] because you had them back there
[26:22] if they took that original atonement
[26:26] come on of the lamb it would have took
[26:28] them straight
[26:29] to jesus christ being crucified for them
[26:35] right and you and i wouldn't be involved
[26:38] come on
[26:40] but see by the way it went
[26:43] moses would smack the rock even though
[26:46] it would set up a wrong thing
[26:48] but yet it would show what god was
[26:50] intending to do
[26:51] to bring israel back
[26:54] right to the atonement praise god
[26:57] they're under the blood of bulls and
[26:59] goats it don't matter if that done the
[27:00] way you said oh no that ended at calvary
[27:03] no there's they're still not under the
[27:05] blood of jesus christ
[27:08] brother around said god comes down each
[27:10] day and heals those people he said but
[27:12] they're still they don't believe him
[27:14] right they're not under the atonement of
[27:16] jesus christ
[27:18] that's what i'm gonna try my best to get
[27:19] everybody to see people say oh they're
[27:21] not in the old testament
[27:23] if you're not born again you're still in
[27:24] the old testament
[27:26] where you're at
[27:28] right jesus christ died to pay the price
[27:30] to come and live in us that's the new
[27:32] testament amen amen see you're still
[27:34] under the law
[27:36] if you're not born again
[27:39] that's why paul would come along and say
[27:40] christ at the end of the law for
[27:42] righteousness
[27:43] if you're not born again today see
[27:47] then you're still under the old
[27:48] testament rules and regulations that's
[27:50] right no no no that was done with
[27:52] calvary show me where it was underway
[27:54] for calvary
[27:56] calvary magnified right
[27:59] all right
[28:00] we're sleeping
[28:02] that was the calling of the natural
[28:04] bringing them out of egypt coming up
[28:06] bringing them to the atonement
[28:08] all right
[28:10] then leviticus 23
[28:13] is not a re-killing of the lamb
[28:16] but it's when israel in the end time
[28:18] will accept the revelation just a
[28:20] hundred forty four thousand them not all
[28:22] israel
[28:23] they will accept the revelation of jesus
[28:26] christ and they'll say where did you get
[28:27] the nail prince in your hands
[28:29] and it thinks through the two witnesses
[28:30] right that's right
[28:32] all right
[28:33] see that'll bring them to a mourning for
[28:35] the keel that's why they separate and
[28:38] cry
[28:40] for days because they see
[28:42] they
[28:45] crucified their own messiah
[28:48] right he said well
[28:50] the ones over here didn't have anything
[28:52] to do with it
[28:53] well i i guess that we're not under sin
[28:55] because he went wrong is that what
[28:58] you're saying
[28:59] well i didn't do it he done it
[29:01] no he represented us
[29:04] he set it up in this way that's right
[29:07] now you want to go that if you want to
[29:09] go that way won't you go the other
[29:10] way john was the only one who went up
[29:13] the rapture
[29:16] come on
[29:18] see if you want to go one way once you
[29:20] can't go the other way with it
[29:22] but john represented the bride right
[29:33] israel will be mourning for the keel
[29:36] when those two witnesses bring the
[29:37] revelation
[29:39] over to them and they can see it
[29:42] they will not be re-killing the lamb
[29:46] they will see the lamb as he leaves the
[29:49] mercy seat and comes to them
[29:52] that's right brother asked me the other
[29:53] day he said what do you think about the
[29:54] lamb leaving the mercy seat
[29:57] i said well first doctrine to hit and
[29:59] come to message was couldn't be saved
[30:01] because it came in the message in 67 and
[30:03] i told him i couldn't be saved after 63
[30:06] because then left the mercy seat i said
[30:08] well according to the bible lamb left
[30:09] the mercy seat
[30:11] before the foundation of the world
[30:14] i said that's what the bible says
[30:16] the prophet never taught nothing like
[30:18] that
[30:20] he said because you got to cover the
[30:21] lamb leaving the mercy seat you realize
[30:23] right now if the rapture took place
[30:26] you'd say the land left the mercy seat
[30:27] with you
[30:29] you better be careful
[30:30] right
[30:31] that's only for you and i
[30:34] you got to remain on the mercy seat for
[30:36] the
[30:37] 144 000
[30:39] come on
[30:41] you know that even after they come in
[30:45] he's got to be on the mercy seat to go
[30:47] to the white throne
[30:48] because there will be people at the
[30:50] white room given eternal life right
[30:52] right do i worry about redemption being
[30:55] over or what this is or that is
[30:59] why not worry about the redemption
[31:00] that's being revealed by the prophet
[31:03] unto the bride of christ to get her
[31:04] ready amen
[31:07] because what we're looking at the
[31:08] trumpet is what that's the calling out
[31:10] of israel
[31:12] you know that under that we covered the
[31:13] 200 000 000 demons it was loose
[31:16] on through hitler and mussolini and them
[31:19] to drive the jews back to the homeland
[31:22] that's right
[31:24] i hope you got what i talk about on that
[31:26] wednesday night what about the tender
[31:28] hand of jehovah
[31:32] with israel
[31:34] putting up with all of their garbage
[31:37] cans
[31:39] and yet he would put him into bondage
[31:43] under the surrounding nations to try to
[31:45] get them to straighten up that's right
[31:47] now what if he hadn't done that right
[31:52] you realize the jews would have never
[31:54] went back to the homeland
[31:56] they were rich people
[31:59] they didn't want to leave germany and
[32:01] and russia and all of these countries
[32:03] and go home
[32:06] why because they were rich
[32:11] so god just said okay
[32:15] i'll send my tender hand of mercy down
[32:17] to them
[32:18] and i'll just kill about six million of
[32:20] them
[32:21] you say god done that well
[32:24] no he permitted it to be done
[32:28] he permitted hitler and him to do that
[32:30] to get the people to go back to the
[32:32] homeland
[32:33] well that don't sound like mercy to me
[32:35] well what if he had to send him back to
[32:36] the home man
[32:40] right
[32:41] okay now what was we talking about
[32:42] wednesday we look at these things to see
[32:45] the natural but then we look and see
[32:46] about us
[32:48] it brought around and say it i'm sitting
[32:49] standing here looking at it did he say
[32:52] that on feast of the trump they said 20
[32:54] years later
[32:58] those demons that was released under
[33:00] hitman and ikeburn eichmann and them
[33:03] mussolini to drive the natural jew to
[33:06] the homeland he said was released on the
[33:08] bride that's right
[33:11] right right right
[33:14] come on pull that nut bro
[33:18] make sure everybody understands what i'm
[33:19] getting at because you'd say well i
[33:21] don't really know what that won't go to
[33:23] read the book
[33:24] you give the paragraph and give the page
[33:26] number and people won't go home and read
[33:27] the book
[33:29] they'll come back later well i don't
[33:30] really know where he said that or not
[33:34] well i gave you the f well i don't know
[33:35] what paragraph's right or not
[33:38] what do we do around here
[33:40] just look at number one
[33:42] this is off the feast of the trumpets
[33:44] paragraph 161 and notice what happened
[33:46] under the sixth trumpet they were
[33:48] turning loose on the jews he talked
[33:49] about the two hundred 000 000 demons
[33:51] right
[33:53] the persecution of the jews supernatural
[33:55] devils nearly 2 000 years been loosed by
[33:57] stalin hitler
[34:00] upon the jews you say well
[34:02] that isn't wrong
[34:04] he said it's the same spirit that's
[34:06] right
[34:07] they've done the same thing they did to
[34:08] the christians in the old pagan roman
[34:10] days all right look at the next one
[34:14] okay
[34:15] paragraph 183
[34:17] thanks to the trumpet what has it done
[34:19] in the cunningness
[34:21] as he said he come in like flatteries
[34:24] and what has he done
[34:26] he bring in the protestant ecumenical
[34:28] council of the world churches the spirit
[34:31] of antichrist upon both of them bringing
[34:33] them to the slaughter just like they did
[34:35] the other in the hour to call the bride
[34:38] how looked in the acquisition church
[34:41] spirit loosed upon what
[34:43] not upon their denominations
[34:46] upon the bride that's right
[34:49] well see you'll get it the bride will
[34:50] not go through that time so you don't go
[34:52] through the tribulation
[34:54] no
[34:55] but they lose their to what
[34:58] and it's to bring us to the message
[35:00] because
[35:00] if you go on reading you've got down
[35:03] to uh
[35:04] i see a paragraph
[35:07] that he's written down somewhere
[35:08] paragraph 189 but around actually even
[35:11] says the feast of the trumpet he said 20
[35:13] years later after that war
[35:18] see so if it's loose under eichmann and
[35:20] hitler them in the 40s
[35:22] in the 60s
[35:23] all those demons that was loosed on
[35:27] the jews
[35:29] is now loosed on the bride that's right
[35:31] you mean god let that brother down i
[35:34] just don't believe you you just you're
[35:36] some kind of a saddest or something well
[35:38] brother must have been something because
[35:40] he's the one that said
[35:41] so you call him that
[35:43] well i don't know about that now well
[35:44] why won't you afraid of it i'm afraid of
[35:47] him but not afraid of me what's the
[35:48] difference in what the word says
[35:51] 20 years after hitler and them drove
[35:54] them to the homeland he's loosed on you
[35:56] and i am amen
[35:59] to do what
[36:01] to drive you and i to the message of the
[36:03] hour
[36:05] the tender hand of god's mercy
[36:09] amen come on amen
[36:12] you say yeah but but that just don't
[36:14] look like god is petting us
[36:16] and i think god's way to do it anyway
[36:19] you show me that in the bible
[36:23] you showed me where he just pat looks
[36:25] like a dodeo granddaddy
[36:27] no he wants his children to stand on his
[36:29] word
[36:30] amen and sometimes he's got to put you
[36:32] in a persecution not a tribulation we
[36:34] don't believe in the tribulation for the
[36:36] bride of jesus right no way
[36:39] but there will be persecutions come upon
[36:41] us
[36:42] to drive us to the message
[36:45] you know it's good for somebody to cross
[36:47] you
[36:48] you get so settled down and you just get
[36:50] on you know everything's okay okay you
[36:52] know and somebody comes along saying hey
[36:54] you're wrong
[36:57] and then wait just to cut and pick a
[36:58] minute i ain't wrong
[37:02] well take what you got right then and
[37:04] try to argue with them about it
[37:06] you might find out you're missing a few
[37:08] pieces out of your puzzle right amen
[37:11] right right right because the bible says
[37:14] there must needs be heresies among you
[37:19] one that they that are approved
[37:22] may be made manifest
[37:26] right
[37:27] so it's good to be crossed right
[37:30] it's good for somebody to tell you hey
[37:32] you're wrong
[37:37] church then what are we doing
[37:40] see those those demons loose by hitler
[37:43] and them came over into a spiritual
[37:45] condition
[37:49] to persecute the bride
[37:51] to drive her to the message
[37:57] you just got down to where you just
[38:00] spiritually speaking you just seem like
[38:02] you're starving to death
[38:04] if you ain't never got there you've got
[38:06] an opportunity ahead of you and you will
[38:08] come there because that
[38:11] the children of god must be brought to
[38:13] god the way and if natural israel it
[38:15] cost him six million besides this that's
[38:17] just a number
[38:19] to get them to come to the homeland
[38:22] you think we're going out of here with a
[38:24] flower bed of ease oh the bride's
[38:26] nothing on the bride not going through
[38:27] tribulation no way in the world
[38:30] but there's persecution coming
[38:34] you say well brother dale i just don't
[38:35] believe that i believe it's all hunky
[38:37] dory from now on well
[38:42] about four more years the way we're
[38:43] going we're gonna find out
[38:47] and i told you over and over it wouldn't
[38:49] make no difference if mccain or what his
[38:51] name was would have been put in the
[38:53] white house four years ago we'd probably
[38:55] be in worse shape than we are now amen
[38:58] bible my bible said i put in kings i
[39:01] take out kings
[39:02] so the right guy's in the white house
[39:05] and i done told you the way i believed
[39:07] it if it was down to one vote
[39:10] and i had it
[39:12] and i knew and i didn't vote now so i
[39:15] ain't voted since kennedy
[39:17] when i found out we put the capital in
[39:19] the white house and i quit voting
[39:21] that's true you vote that's your choice
[39:24] that's your god-given right to america
[39:27] but if there was one boat left
[39:30] and i had it
[39:31] and i knew that guy would be the one
[39:32] that would bring the persecution down
[39:34] upon you and i to drive us to this
[39:36] message i'd go vote double time yeah
[39:42] why because the prophet said we do
[39:44] better under persecution
[39:46] now look folks we ain't looking forward
[39:48] to it it's not a happy time
[39:50] israel being killed all over the country
[39:52] burning cooked and shot and everything
[39:56] in the world
[39:57] that's right but that was god's tender
[39:59] hand driving them to the home
[40:02] all the little trials and the little
[40:04] temptations and problems we have i would
[40:06] really tell you you don't understand me
[40:07] i'm having so much trouble
[40:11] thank god for trouble
[40:16] come on
[40:17] am i right yes
[40:21] you say well you sure won't say that
[40:22] when anything you get hungry
[40:24] i'll say i told you we're going to get
[40:26] hungry
[40:27] i hope somebody can speak the word
[40:30] amen
[40:31] come on folks
[40:34] yes
[40:35] i used to have enough food in my house
[40:37] to feed this church for a year
[40:42] because i looked at it like it was
[40:44] coming
[40:45] but then i found out the stuff was
[40:47] getting too old
[40:49] and what is it which one is it the one
[40:51] under one other of them they they keep
[40:53] your supply in their house and but they
[40:56] rotate it they want it they know what to
[40:57] do they you know they rotate it out and
[40:59] heat it up you know what we know we
[41:01] rotated out and we ate a hog
[41:04] are you talking about one of the biggest
[41:05] hogs you've ever seen
[41:07] we raised a hog out of what we had in
[41:09] the house
[41:11] you know i still think you'll have
[41:12] something laying around the house
[41:15] what if the weather goes back
[41:17] that's right
[41:18] if you ain't got nothing there's nothing
[41:20] in the grocery store
[41:22] that's right you know i heard a man the
[41:23] other day i don't mean it's a joke i
[41:24] heard a man the other day said he said
[41:27] this ice wouldn't come it was supposed
[41:29] to hit us here you know and everything
[41:30] and everybody run to the store and he
[41:32] said
[41:33] tuesday morning they were taking their
[41:35] milk and getting their money back
[41:40] i thought that is about like people
[41:42] and they found that it wasn't going to
[41:43] ice up so they're going to take a few
[41:44] gallons of milk back
[41:47] but listen church
[41:49] how serious
[41:52] those demons have loosed on you and i to
[41:55] drive us to the message of our lives
[42:00] this message is going to take you and i
[42:02] interchange and do it
[42:06] now you remember the reading there what
[42:08] he said
[42:11] he said you come in like flatteries
[42:15] right you know the word flatteries is
[42:17] used in the book of daniel daniel 11 21
[42:19] 11 32 and 11 34.
[42:25] in the book of daniel flatteries
[42:29] that's when you're invited in that's not
[42:31] when you're
[42:32] forced into something
[42:35] this ruler that's come will take over is
[42:37] going to come in by flatteries
[42:40] in other words be invited in you want to
[42:42] go back to the seal book 63 where the
[42:45] prophet said they've got satan superman
[42:50] in the pope
[42:52] come on that was in 63 amen
[42:56] all right church come in by flatteries
[43:00] you know you're going to vote to do away
[43:02] with your rights oh
[43:04] lord have mercy
[43:07] that's kind of an odd way of saying it
[43:08] because they're going to force you to
[43:09] vote
[43:11] and you say i won't vote a no vote
[43:14] is a yes
[43:17] come on a no vote is a yes right
[43:21] so it don't matter where you vote or not
[43:23] you're gonna vote away your rights
[43:24] you're doing it now
[43:26] and they're passing laws what are they
[43:28] facing now you know in 1974 they passed
[43:31] a law that most of you couldn't come to
[43:32] church today right in the state of
[43:34] georgia that you couldn't travel over 25
[43:36] miles to go to church that law is still
[43:38] on the books
[43:40] that's 1974 when you had the oil crisis
[43:44] you see we're looking for things to come
[43:46] and i'm telling you we're already here
[43:47] is that this
[43:51] all right
[43:51] but listen church
[43:54] now the great eternal god
[43:57] would be so wonderful to israel to drive
[43:59] her to the homeland
[44:02] now you know what your prophet taught on
[44:04] the fifth seal
[44:07] so we don't have to go back to that do
[44:08] we
[44:11] who are those people in the fifth seal
[44:14] brother brown said it was the jews
[44:17] that was killed from calvary
[44:20] up till man
[44:22] now not ever jew
[44:24] because that wouldn't make it fit right
[44:26] right
[44:27] because it's not every jew be saving the
[44:29] end times only 144 000 right right
[44:34] but the field seal shows you that those
[44:36] people were not annihilated away from
[44:38] god
[44:39] the true jews will be given eternal life
[44:43] that's according to the fifth seal come
[44:45] on
[44:47] all right
[44:48] then in doing that
[44:50] look at the tender hand of god's mercy
[44:54] i know that you don't understand myself
[44:57] but
[44:58] you know it was a horrible thing when
[45:00] those 20 kids died up during that that
[45:02] man just went in and killed him but you
[45:03] know what there was 20 kids went to
[45:05] heaven that day
[45:08] that's a tender hand of mercy of god i
[45:09] don't care what religion they belong to
[45:11] who their mom and daddy was or what was
[45:13] going on or whatever
[45:15] they were like four or five-year-olds
[45:16] maybe
[45:19] see you don't look at it right
[45:22] you look at it as a horrible thing no i
[45:24] don't want it to happen again no way
[45:30] but the tender hand of mercy
[45:32] just think about that
[45:34] see then we're looking at it comparing
[45:36] what happens to them
[45:40] to see what will take place to you and i
[45:45] to drive us to the homeland
[45:48] now i'm not going to say the wrong thing
[45:50] i hope about it because i know people
[45:52] misunderstand me anyway but you know
[45:53] there's a lot of preachers running about
[45:55] the country because of bad luck
[45:58] nah i'm not going to argue with nobody
[46:01] i'm just going to say bad luck didn't
[46:03] call me to preach
[46:05] now they said it did to them
[46:07] and that may be right
[46:10] you see people you don't get up say well
[46:11] the lord
[46:12] the lord was going to take my family if
[46:14] i didn't start preaching
[46:17] well now i want scripture for that
[46:19] i want the prophet's message for that
[46:26] but you see that's what we look at we
[46:28] think that we've got it all figured out
[46:30] we see this message is what's supposed
[46:31] to straighten out all the things we
[46:33] thought we had figured out that's right
[46:35] right
[46:36] right see only by this message can we
[46:39] understand the bible
[46:43] see my ideas and your ideas was was way
[46:45] off right right i told you somewhere i
[46:48] had heard when i was a kid that at the
[46:50] end of the world when it comes is i knew
[46:52] it was supposed to be in the cloud
[46:53] somewhere and something might hurt all
[46:55] them things in my mind and
[46:57] somebody said they'd be a cloud come
[46:59] over said well you know it was the right
[47:00] cloudy look it looked like a rainbow i
[47:02] mean excuse me looked like an umbrella
[47:05] well every time they come up a clown
[47:08] got it made this time colleen's umbrella
[47:14] come on church
[47:15] we used to think mama taught us that
[47:17] hell was eternal right right
[47:20] if we didn't get saved we're going to
[47:21] burn in hell eternally right and that's
[47:24] what they've done was try to scare us
[47:26] into being saved right
[47:29] right
[47:30] the prophet said you scare a person into
[47:32] doing something he said the next time
[47:34] it's twofold trying to get him to come
[47:36] that's right don't you scare them kids
[47:40] jesus don't like you
[47:42] get you up with a hickory and whoop them
[47:48] don't tell them jesus don't like them
[47:50] that's
[47:54] do what you're supposed to do with mama
[47:55] and daddy yes that's right spirit of the
[47:58] rod what does it say
[48:00] your bible says spoil the child
[48:03] well you believe in beating kids no i
[48:05] believe in correcting here
[48:10] not beating them you beat one and it
[48:12] goes too far i'll take you to jail
[48:14] i mean i'll take you to jail i'll come
[48:16] to your house and take you to jail
[48:22] i mean to be mom and daddy
[48:25] and raise the kids correctly and correct
[48:27] them
[48:29] well let them grow up to be what they
[48:31] want too that's what's messed this world
[48:33] up
[48:36] let them grow up
[48:39] after they're 18 20 years old they'll be
[48:42] what they want to do
[48:46] but that's okay
[48:48] everybody said that i don't preach on
[48:50] them things but
[48:51] i hate it every once in a while enough
[48:52] to let you know where i stand
[48:55] but listen
[48:57] comparing
[49:00] israel
[49:01] in her journey
[49:03] to our journey that's right
[49:07] and then we don't have to be there when
[49:08] these things take place
[49:11] but we look at what's taking place even
[49:13] now
[49:15] and see
[49:16] what god is doing
[49:19] to get his bride ready
[49:22] to bring us to the message of the hour
[49:26] but the main thing is not as i said now
[49:29] troubles
[49:31] that's part of god's way of doing things
[49:34] but
[49:36] what is he wanting us to do
[49:41] if persecution will bring you to a
[49:43] rapture then just line up and we'll get
[49:46] the belts out and start whooping each
[49:47] other all right
[49:49] now is that plain enough
[49:51] that won't work
[49:53] so i'm not teaching persecution to drive
[49:56] us to the message that way like you're
[49:58] thinking
[50:00] i'm talking about the tender hand of
[50:02] mercy of almighty god
[50:04] that's the only way he can get our
[50:06] attention that's right
[50:15] to get our attention
[50:20] i like the way the prophet says it like
[50:22] this he's preaching on desperation
[50:25] when he says one statement like this he
[50:27] says there's no way for us to get
[50:28] desperate god has to make us desperate
[50:32] okay
[50:33] keep reading in the same book
[50:36] you know what he'll say
[50:39] he said what all the things we've seen
[50:41] or to make us destroy amen right now
[50:44] come on see that we don't get the people
[50:46] quoting both statements
[50:48] they're quoting the one they want to
[50:49] line up with their doctrinal idea or
[50:51] something
[50:52] instead of stating it like he's saying
[50:54] it
[50:54] see what you and i have seen the hour
[50:57] that we're living were to drive us to
[50:59] desperation
[51:03] amen
[51:05] you don't ever think about know your
[51:06] parents you know everything about your
[51:07] children
[51:10] you do anything in the world to prepare
[51:11] them to keep from them being
[51:14] hungry or
[51:16] you know things happening right
[51:18] come on you do anything wrong with me
[51:22] but what about bringing them to church
[51:26] i mean you know that's got a problem
[51:28] because bringing means somebody gotta
[51:30] bring them
[51:36] did you get that
[51:38] do i need to rephrase that for you to
[51:39] understand it
[51:41] if you're going to bring them brother
[51:43] brown said
[51:44] you know what around said it was a sin
[51:46] listen you know me quoting he said it
[51:48] was a sin to send your kids to sunday
[51:50] school
[51:51] or church wanted to do one other
[51:52] statement
[51:54] boy you stop on that
[51:56] see that
[51:57] he didn't believe in it
[52:01] would you please know right that's
[52:15] all right you work all week to make food
[52:18] buy clothes
[52:21] that's right
[52:22] and yet you don't take the kids for sure
[52:24] okay
[52:25] mark that milk
[52:27] that's a good one okay
[52:29] now listen church
[52:31] looking in the book of revelations to
[52:33] see
[52:35] what that will help us
[52:38] to see ourselves and what's going on in
[52:39] our day amen
[52:42] but now get to the point i'm saying a
[52:43] moment ago that i didn't finish
[52:45] it's not persecutions
[52:47] that reveals the word
[52:51] okay
[52:52] persecutions don't reveal the word
[52:56] right
[52:57] come on right
[52:59] uh you understand what i'm saying
[53:01] persecution somebody whipping you don't
[53:03] reveal the word to you
[53:06] it might reveal something else to you
[53:08] but it don't reveal her to you right
[53:13] see then to drive us to the homeland the
[53:15] message of the hour
[53:19] if we left here and move over here and
[53:22] we keep this thing doctrine from here to
[53:25] here
[53:26] right god hasn't done anything right
[53:29] right
[53:30] right that's right
[53:32] just this message
[53:36] this message is my homeland amen amen
[53:40] the message of the hours my homeland
[53:42] that's right
[53:43] that's my inheritance
[53:46] and i find it it that i own everything
[53:49] am i right
[53:52] everybody that needs a squatter
[53:57] because that's where you're going to
[53:58] believe it
[54:00] but you see then if we don't bring the
[54:02] message what good is the persecution
[54:07] amen
[54:09] israel
[54:10] god drove them back to the homeland
[54:16] and like i was praying out there
[54:17] wednesday you know what brother claude
[54:18] said about it it was a good good point
[54:22] world war one
[54:25] ended
[54:26] with nobody knowing why it ended
[54:28] right you know what ended
[54:30] because they had taken over israel
[54:33] and was getting set in them free to
[54:36] worry that 20 years later or so
[54:40] 30 years almost
[54:42] they could become a nation
[54:45] so world war one was thought about
[54:47] israel
[54:49] well that's going to call it fought
[54:50] about
[54:52] you know ain't it audit we fought
[54:53] germany in them and you only god that in
[54:55] world war one they had in god we trust
[54:57] on their belt buckles
[55:00] and we had in god we trust on our belt
[55:02] buckles
[55:04] they don't know why the war ended
[55:07] 20 years later you're fighting them
[55:08] again
[55:10] kind of like the
[55:13] amorites and the things in the bible
[55:15] right
[55:16] totally annihilate a nation in the next
[55:18] chapter they fight now
[55:24] but now listen
[55:26] it's the revealed word
[55:31] why were they put back into israel in
[55:33] the natural
[55:34] to establish the nation of israel
[55:38] right
[55:42] getting it ready
[55:45] to work
[55:46] that god could call out 144 thousand
[55:48] amen
[55:50] out of all that nation
[55:53] we see brett around spent all those
[55:54] years trying to turn our hearts back to
[55:56] the face of the father is that
[55:58] the message
[55:59] you don't hear that talk of much anymore
[56:01] but i still think it's right that's
[56:04] right i don't think we've got so
[56:05] revelated until we've lost the faith of
[56:07] the fathers
[56:08] i think a lot of people have because
[56:09] they've lost the word that's right
[56:11] that's all right that's their business
[56:13] that's not driving me to the homeland
[56:17] you see you understand now let me make a
[56:19] point then go on see god was getting
[56:21] ready to give them a nation
[56:24] he wasn't just going to put them back in
[56:25] israel and let them stay in bondage
[56:28] right
[56:30] he was going to give their nation back
[56:32] to him when that flag would fly again
[56:34] the only flag that's ever resurrected
[56:41] right
[56:43] he was making them ready to be a nation
[56:46] and then making it ready to call that
[56:48] 144 000 out of there
[56:50] this message is to call out a group of
[56:53] people
[56:55] right
[56:56] right
[56:57] now let me quote some more of them
[57:00] didn't the prophet say that they would
[57:01] have to be a bride come out of this
[57:04] church that's right
[57:07] he divides their church in the bride
[57:09] right
[57:10] he says the church gonna go through the
[57:11] tribulation that's right but he said the
[57:14] bride's not so there's gonna be a bride
[57:16] called out of it just like that 144 000
[57:19] is going to be called out of israel amen
[57:23] the rest of them are israelites
[57:26] come from the same abrahams and that
[57:28] food down to the ledges but they're not
[57:30] to predestinate it right you see what
[57:32] i'm trying to do is just pick up things
[57:34] and just talk about it as far as you and
[57:36] i
[57:37] yeah
[57:39] you and i and where we're at
[57:42] all right
[57:44] see what i like then is to look at the
[57:46] message
[57:48] you know
[57:50] i've always said i thought maybe my
[57:52] ministry was too take things that look
[57:54] like the prophet says this and the
[57:56] prophet says that the bible says this
[57:58] the bible says that looks like it's
[58:00] going in different directions
[58:02] and
[58:03] you know just kind of
[58:05] study on that a while and see that it's
[58:07] brought together right
[58:10] and be a wonderful picture
[58:12] just like i was saying the other day you
[58:14] know run around about 30 something times
[58:15] says you're gonna get a new body
[58:20] come on
[58:24] but then he explains it's not this
[58:27] going to get another body we're going to
[58:30] get this body redeemed right
[58:33] all
[58:34] right you said well which quote do you
[58:37] want i want both of them right
[58:40] but when this body
[58:42] is redeemed it will be new
[58:48] all right it just takes a little while
[58:50] for the holy spirit to put the quotes
[58:51] together come on that's it
[58:54] and that's what i love about it
[58:56] i like to look at something and see
[58:57] something
[58:59] boy
[59:01] man according to my mind that don't fit
[59:03] right
[59:06] and then you keep looking at it
[59:09] you say well there's one thing about it
[59:11] he didn't say both times
[59:13] right you know both of them can't be
[59:15] right exactly yeah
[59:17] that's like my brother said that time
[59:19] when
[59:20] you way back in the 60s and they were
[59:22] talking about the daniel 70 weeks and
[59:24] you know arguing seven or three and a
[59:25] half and he said well said i guess it's
[59:28] 10
[59:31] now if i told you who that was you'd get
[59:33] mad at me
[59:35] but i heard him
[59:37] all right
[59:39] but you see
[59:41] it can't be both uh
[59:44] so somewhere it's got to come together
[59:46] right
[59:48] then it's a revelation amen
[59:50] the revelation is what's going the
[59:52] prophet wanted us to get amen right
[59:58] just as the preparation with israel was
[1:00:00] to get her to the homeland to where he
[1:00:02] could draw that hundred forty-four
[1:00:03] thousand mile an hour
[1:00:04] this little bride he's had churches
[1:00:07] churches churches
[1:00:09] is where your prophet sent it one day
[1:00:12] he said he's even had bride bride brides
[1:00:16] but he said those come in one amen
[1:00:20] now what's he talking about
[1:00:21] was all him brides wrong
[1:00:25] oh
[1:00:26] that's where your problem's at
[1:00:29] right around get in the steel book in
[1:00:31] places and say
[1:00:32] that lutheran western then was a
[1:00:34] substitute
[1:00:37] you remember that
[1:00:40] we had a big man here wasn't supposed to
[1:00:42] preach everyone stood right here one day
[1:00:44] and said see that i said
[1:00:46] luther wesley pentecost is all faults
[1:00:49] well that wasn't what brother brown said
[1:00:53] well well he said a substitute well you
[1:00:56] know the blood of wolves and goats were
[1:00:57] the substitutions right
[1:00:59] until the blood of jesus christ came for
[1:01:01] in other words it was partial revelation
[1:01:03] right amen partial realization you were
[1:01:06] familiar with that yes but we're
[1:01:08] supposed to be down here to perfect
[1:01:09] realization amen not just partial
[1:01:14] all right now
[1:01:16] you know the few weeks ago when i quote
[1:01:17] brother brown when he says it
[1:01:19] those combat beasts
[1:01:22] blind the ox of man the eagle he said
[1:01:24] but under them the end time couldn't be
[1:01:26] brought
[1:01:27] i'm paraphrasing it but i'll be glad to
[1:01:28] find it right
[1:01:30] he said that revelation couldn't come
[1:01:32] that was needed in the end time through
[1:01:34] the line the option of man
[1:01:46] oh
[1:01:47] but you didn't have a perfect
[1:01:48] understanding that's right
[1:01:54] they didn't have perfect understanding
[1:01:56] you ever notice when he gets over there
[1:01:58] and questions and answers before he
[1:02:00] preached the seventh seal
[1:02:02] he said if that seventh seal don't break
[1:02:04] we're just presuming
[1:02:08] presumed means to venture without
[1:02:09] authority and all week long he's
[1:02:11] preached thus saith the lord now what's
[1:02:13] he doing
[1:02:15] come on church i'm sorry that i bring
[1:02:17] these things to your attention to get
[1:02:19] you the thing
[1:02:23] but you see there was dust saying the
[1:02:24] lord through the week the seals was
[1:02:26] right
[1:02:27] that he preached was right
[1:02:30] but if that seventh seal don't break
[1:02:35] right right
[1:02:38] come on you left with a problem
[1:02:40] just like
[1:02:41] if this bride don't reach the place
[1:02:45] to be chained
[1:02:46] in a moment a twinkle of an eye right
[1:02:48] then everything behind it
[1:02:50] has got a problem
[1:02:55] right right right that's where i love to
[1:02:57] get them little things and just see this
[1:03:04] now then we got something to stand on we
[1:03:06] got a revelation
[1:03:08] okay let's do something just for a
[1:03:09] minute
[1:03:10] i'm not going to be able to get the
[1:03:11] whole message but that's all right
[1:03:12] brother
[1:03:13] brother matthew be preaching this
[1:03:15] afternoon now give me notes for
[1:03:16] wednesday i don't even have to study
[1:03:18] that'd be good
[1:03:21] all right
[1:03:22] go to revelation 11
[1:03:27] and let's just read this from revelation
[1:03:31] 11.
[1:03:35] now we're going to compare revelation 11
[1:03:38] with zechariah 4 in just a moment
[1:03:42] so
[1:03:45] we read this to start off and that was
[1:03:46] given to me a reading of the measure and
[1:03:48] a different thing happening the main
[1:03:49] thing i want you to come on down and
[1:03:51] give it a
[1:03:52] power unto my two witnesses
[1:03:54] they're prophesying what 42 months three
[1:03:56] and a half years one thousands
[1:03:59] uh 206 which is what
[1:04:02] three and a half years
[1:04:04] these are the two olive trees
[1:04:07] yes
[1:04:08] and
[1:04:08] the two candle sticks
[1:04:12] before the god of the earth
[1:04:15] okay
[1:04:18] these are the two olive trees
[1:04:23] and the two candlesticks
[1:04:26] all right right
[1:04:29] now we know that brother brennaman is
[1:04:31] explaining these two olive trees
[1:04:34] number four on you go ahead brother
[1:04:36] number four
[1:04:38] who are these two ollie trees
[1:04:42] he said it's moses
[1:04:45] and elijah
[1:04:48] the two olive trees
[1:04:51] all right
[1:04:54] he says when in zechariah 4
[1:04:57] and 11 them two olive trees and so forth
[1:04:59] which is moses and elijah when they come
[1:05:01] on the earth they prophesy
[1:05:03] 1264 days
[1:05:05] exactly three and a half years all right
[1:05:08] now
[1:05:11] he says that's those two olive trees if
[1:05:14] i have time if i don't at the end of it
[1:05:16] i'll try to give you the quote
[1:05:19] he says those two olive trees is moses
[1:05:22] and elijah right we just read it
[1:05:24] now in a minute we get down to the
[1:05:26] patmos vision
[1:05:28] and he says the two olive trees is the
[1:05:30] older new testament
[1:05:43] you got something look like it's going
[1:05:44] this way and you got something looks
[1:05:46] like it's going that way right
[1:05:49] now
[1:05:51] but it's got to be brought together amen
[1:05:55] okay
[1:05:57] and bringing it together then it'll
[1:05:59] bring the revelation of what's
[1:06:01] it'll require that the revelations
[1:06:03] transpired
[1:06:04] all right now
[1:06:06] i know and you know too that they argued
[1:06:08] with brother graham about it and someone
[1:06:09] wanted to make it moaning book to be
[1:06:11] enoch and elijah and all of the things
[1:06:14] and uh
[1:06:15] he says no he said because in its
[1:06:17] ministry don't top out and things so he
[1:06:19] typed out the ministry of moses and
[1:06:21] elijah right the closing of the heavens
[1:06:23] and the plagues and the things that
[1:06:24] happened and all that was happening to
[1:06:26] through elijah
[1:06:28] and he types it out to show all right
[1:06:30] another way of looking at it is when you
[1:06:32] get over to matthew 20
[1:06:35] matthew wanted to
[1:06:37] somebody help me said matthew there
[1:06:39] where is it 16 or 17 worth it then he
[1:06:42] goes up on the mountain and the two
[1:06:43] witnesses appear with him which is moses
[1:06:45] and elijah the bible even said it's
[1:06:47] moses and elijah
[1:06:49] that comes with those two witnesses and
[1:06:50] that is the second coming of jesus
[1:06:52] christ
[1:06:53] all right
[1:06:54] now so we're holding it to
[1:06:57] seeing now why would it be that he would
[1:07:00] say
[1:07:02] that the two olive trees
[1:07:05] is moses and elijah
[1:07:08] and then he would say that it's the old
[1:07:10] in the new testament
[1:07:17] see
[1:07:18] you know
[1:07:19] i'm saying see this is going to get to a
[1:07:21] revelation amen
[1:07:23] but we got to go through to get to where
[1:07:25] we can see it exactly right
[1:07:27] okay all right now the revelation is
[1:07:29] what's going to turn us back
[1:07:32] not the literal pages on the book
[1:07:34] remember the prophet what he said he
[1:07:36] said this bible can be questioned as
[1:07:38] long as it's laying here on letters
[1:07:40] that's right
[1:07:41] but he said when it's revealed that's it
[1:07:43] all right like i've told you over and
[1:07:45] over boyle roberts university has
[1:07:47] brother brown's message
[1:07:50] they have the books the tapes and the
[1:07:52] things with a computer any professor in
[1:07:55] that college could speak exactly what
[1:07:58] i'm saying today
[1:07:59] that's right because he could pull up
[1:08:01] the quotes
[1:08:03] what did brother brown say about these
[1:08:04] two women oh that's moses and elijah
[1:08:07] well school we don't agree with that but
[1:08:09] it's what the man says
[1:08:11] you understand
[1:08:13] they can tell you everything brother
[1:08:15] brown says
[1:08:18] well is that a revelation
[1:08:24] is it a revelation to know
[1:08:26] that the white horse rider is the
[1:08:27] antichrist
[1:08:36] you see yes that was a revelation
[1:08:37] brought by the prophet amen
[1:08:39] good
[1:08:40] but what about you now
[1:08:44] what's been revealed from you today
[1:08:48] you know what i love about brother brown
[1:08:49] he said you're standing the line with
[1:08:50] the book that's him
[1:08:54] and he said same ones revealing that
[1:08:55] standing right here in me and there's a
[1:08:56] day somebody else going that away right
[1:08:59] now can you see somebody else riding
[1:09:01] away from you as the word is being
[1:09:03] revealed to you
[1:09:07] so now you're getting down to seeing
[1:09:08] what that steel really is right right
[1:09:12] it's revealing jesus christ amen the
[1:09:15] seals don't reveal the devil
[1:09:17] that's what we went wrong on it we think
[1:09:20] it reveals a horrible thing it reveals
[1:09:22] the revelation of jesus christ was why i
[1:09:24] read 69 times revelation 1 1-3
[1:09:29] it's a revelation of jesus christ
[1:09:35] it's not the revealing of the devil
[1:09:37] when you see christ you'll see the devil
[1:09:38] going the other way
[1:09:41] of course we're trinitarians come on we
[1:09:43] didn't have much problems with it
[1:09:44] because we were trinitarians we had one
[1:09:46] on the throne and one over here and one
[1:09:47] over there and we didn't know how many
[1:09:49] others run around in the middle
[1:09:51] right
[1:09:53] but see then god started revealing the
[1:09:55] one god to you
[1:09:57] you know what happened all these things
[1:09:59] riding off in the other directions run
[1:10:01] out and prove this wrong that's right
[1:10:04] and you see the lamb
[1:10:06] in the new birth and you're on your
[1:10:07] birth
[1:10:08] just because right around brought the
[1:10:10] message don't make you and i turn back
[1:10:13] right
[1:10:14] it just gave us the
[1:10:16] opportunity amen to be turned back amen
[1:10:21] right
[1:10:23] and look what it says now
[1:10:25] the two olive trees
[1:10:28] i know i don't have time so we'll do it
[1:10:29] we'll shortcut it okay brother joe go to
[1:10:32] number five we're short cutting i'll
[1:10:34] pick it up no wait wait wait we got to
[1:10:36] go here we got to go to this
[1:10:38] come on
[1:10:39] because
[1:10:40] you missed the whole point
[1:10:42] all right zechariah 4.
[1:10:44] look what he says
[1:10:46] call me coming home
[1:10:48] weighed me out of sleep and said unto me
[1:10:49] what sister i said i've looked and
[1:10:51] behold a candlestick of gold with a bowl
[1:10:53] up on the top of it and seven lamps
[1:10:55] they're on and seven pops into seven
[1:10:57] lamps which are on the top they're up
[1:10:59] and two olive trees buy it
[1:11:02] one up on the right side of the bowl and
[1:11:05] the other up on the left side of the
[1:11:06] boat okay run it up before we get down
[1:11:08] to the lights where you can see what it
[1:11:09] is and we know the two ollies what are
[1:11:11] these two ollie trees
[1:11:15] proving that it's moses and elijah what
[1:11:16] does it come to the light what are these
[1:11:18] two olive trees
[1:11:19] which through the two golden pipes can't
[1:11:22] go the golden oil out of themselves
[1:11:25] then he said these are the two anointed
[1:11:27] ones which stand by the lord of the
[1:11:29] whole earth
[1:11:32] two witnesses
[1:11:34] that stand with jesus on mount
[1:11:36] transfiguration amen
[1:11:39] so it's moses and elijah it's not enoch
[1:11:41] and in a different thing
[1:11:44] all right
[1:11:45] now we get that lined up
[1:11:47] but now i want you to think about
[1:11:49] something brother joe pull up number
[1:11:50] number
[1:11:52] five eight i want you to read two
[1:11:55] scriptures
[1:12:00] revelations 11 4 says
[1:12:03] these are two olive trees and two
[1:12:06] candlesticks
[1:12:12] come on are you ready okay
[1:12:16] the people out there might not see it
[1:12:17] but turn your bible
[1:12:20] revelation 11 4 says there's two olive
[1:12:23] trees and two candlesticks standing
[1:12:25] before
[1:12:26] the god of the earth
[1:12:30] zechariah says what says thou looked and
[1:12:32] said behold
[1:12:34] a candlestick of gold
[1:12:37] with a ball up on the top of it
[1:12:39] and it's seven lamps they're on and
[1:12:41] seven pipes from the seven lights which
[1:12:43] are from the top there
[1:12:44] and two olive trees by it
[1:12:47] one up on the right side the bowl
[1:12:53] in the book of revelation you got two
[1:12:55] candlesticks
[1:13:00] all right it's not supposed to be
[1:13:01] candlesticks gonna be lap stands right
[1:13:03] because candlesticks don't work
[1:13:05] candles would burn out so it's not that
[1:13:06] it's supposed to be lap stand i got the
[1:13:08] quote from the prophet here you already
[1:13:09] know that all right a capital will burn
[1:13:12] out and it's not it's a seven gold right
[1:13:14] there it isn't in the thing showing you
[1:13:16] the seven golden candlesticks and the
[1:13:18] wicks running up and the things you know
[1:13:20] going to it
[1:13:23] now
[1:13:26] what are they describing
[1:13:29] the same thing
[1:13:35] one says two candlesticks
[1:13:38] the other one says one candlestick
[1:13:44] hey
[1:13:49] what's the difference what's the point
[1:13:55] the point is that you've got something
[1:13:56] going this way it's not going that way
[1:13:58] yes
[1:14:01] this is not dealing with two white blind
[1:14:02] man and one blind man that one writes
[1:14:04] one or another one
[1:14:06] this is the two prophets writing the
[1:14:08] word right okay
[1:14:13] but back here in zechariah
[1:14:16] he's explaining because you're going in
[1:14:18] zechariah and what does it say he says
[1:14:20] this is the spirit of the lord
[1:14:22] right zechariah 4.
[1:14:25] come on there's going down through there
[1:14:26] this is what is this he said this is the
[1:14:29] spirit of the lord this is not my power
[1:14:31] not my mind but by the spirit of the
[1:14:33] lord
[1:14:35] all right
[1:14:37] zechariah is looking forward
[1:14:43] and he sees a seven golden candle stick
[1:14:50] and he sees a bowl on there
[1:14:53] bowl up on the top
[1:14:57] and he sees
[1:14:59] pipes running out
[1:15:01] he sees the two olive trees
[1:15:04] all right
[1:15:07] that's moses and elijah right or as the
[1:15:10] prophet says that's the old and new
[1:15:12] testament
[1:15:13] because there's worthy oil is being
[1:15:15] drawn from right that's why it can't be
[1:15:17] candles see they burn out
[1:15:20] so it's lighting of the candlesticks you
[1:15:22] know the things that goes across
[1:15:25] and when you're getting in there then
[1:15:27] you're seeing that zechariah
[1:15:31] he's seeing
[1:15:33] the seven church ages
[1:15:35] right
[1:15:38] zechariah seen the seven church ages
[1:15:40] because he got the seven votes seven
[1:15:42] pipes up you know he's not all over the
[1:15:43] place or the bold in the seven pots or
[1:15:45] seven lamps
[1:15:47] he's describing
[1:15:53] the church
[1:15:57] they would come down to seven church
[1:15:58] ages
[1:16:00] and that's why and zechariah said that
[1:16:02] you know not by not power not by mine
[1:16:04] let's see what
[1:16:10] and he answered when he said i don't
[1:16:11] know who this is
[1:16:13] verse 6 the fourth chapter then he
[1:16:15] answered and spake
[1:16:17] unto me saying this is the word of the
[1:16:19] lord unto the removable
[1:16:24] now the word of the lord to jerubal was
[1:16:27] the word of all of those old testament
[1:16:29] prophets
[1:16:31] and then you got seven golden
[1:16:32] candlesticks and you got seven angels
[1:16:36] that the word comes to
[1:16:38] right
[1:16:39] each messenger to each age
[1:16:41] and you've got the life one to kept it
[1:16:43] all off to bring the revelation of the
[1:16:45] hour
[1:16:47] all right so when you see it in the new
[1:16:49] testament you don't see exactly what
[1:16:51] you're looking at
[1:16:53] because of one reason
[1:16:56] see in revelations if you'll notice
[1:17:01] these
[1:17:02] are the two olive trees
[1:17:08] and
[1:17:09] the two candlesticks
[1:17:16] okay
[1:17:19] but zachariah only described one
[1:17:20] candlestick right
[1:17:24] but they're all coming from each side so
[1:17:25] it's the old and the new testament
[1:17:28] but it's the two witnesses
[1:17:32] right
[1:17:33] because over in revelations you're only
[1:17:35] dealing with the two witnesses you're
[1:17:37] not dealing with the church
[1:17:40] are you listening you'll see the
[1:17:41] difference
[1:17:42] zechariah describes the church
[1:17:45] the bride
[1:17:46] seven golden candlesticks out of one
[1:17:49] lamp stand right
[1:17:51] one lamp stand with the seven pipes
[1:17:53] running out
[1:17:57] and he says this is the power of god
[1:18:00] this is the word of god
[1:18:05] he's describing you and i
[1:18:08] john on patmos is not describing you and
[1:18:10] i because we're done gone into rapture
[1:18:17] come on get the thing what it's saying
[1:18:18] it don't say
[1:18:20] it don't say these two olive trees and
[1:18:24] then besides that there's two
[1:18:26] candlesticks standing out here
[1:18:31] it doesn't say that
[1:18:32] that's what your mind is reading into it
[1:18:38] it says
[1:18:39] these are the two olive trees and the
[1:18:41] two candlesticks
[1:18:43] well they're one of the same because
[1:18:44] that's the old and the new testament
[1:18:47] that those two prophets will take to
[1:18:49] israel
[1:18:51] in their and that 144 000 will come out
[1:18:54] of that right
[1:18:58] they will describe
[1:19:01] the candlesticks
[1:19:04] they will describe christ of
[1:19:06] what zechariah's talking about
[1:19:09] you know that they're selling church
[1:19:11] ages in the old testament that's right
[1:19:14] now i can't put them together i'm honest
[1:19:15] i get a few of them but i can't i can
[1:19:17] tell you where miriam and their dancing
[1:19:19] with pentecostals but hey some of it i
[1:19:21] can't put together was honest
[1:19:25] because i never heard the prophet put it
[1:19:26] together
[1:19:27] now if i find where he put it together i
[1:19:29] can tell you what you are
[1:19:31] all right but you see what i'm getting
[1:19:34] at see we're we're connected in this
[1:19:38] praise god this is us
[1:19:41] this is after we're gone in the rapture
[1:19:44] zechariah's describing you and i the
[1:19:46] black
[1:19:48] revelation is describing the two
[1:19:50] witnesses
[1:19:52] and the entire bible standing there
[1:19:56] the two wings of the eagle the old and
[1:19:58] the new testament stretched out through
[1:20:00] those two prophets
[1:20:02] they're not lawgivers
[1:20:06] they're not standing there screaming the
[1:20:08] law
[1:20:11] they're preaching the revelation of
[1:20:12] jesus
[1:20:16] you see it does pertain to you and i we
[1:20:19] do see ourselves in these things
[1:20:21] because they're going to tell them these
[1:20:23] two prophets
[1:20:25] is going to tell them
[1:20:27] the entire plan
[1:20:30] of redemption that's right
[1:20:34] now
[1:20:38] they're going to describe to them this
[1:20:40] is what i want to finish with
[1:20:42] see then they're going to tell them
[1:20:44] about that feel sealed you
[1:20:48] come on
[1:20:50] if they're going to tell them about all
[1:20:51] the rest they're going to tell them
[1:20:52] about to feel sealed you
[1:20:54] see that was the secret that was hidden
[1:20:56] in the bible that no one knew
[1:21:00] we could read how that israel was
[1:21:02] blinded
[1:21:04] in part for us and things yeah
[1:21:07] but we didn't know what to do with them
[1:21:09] right
[1:21:11] we just blinded themselves to hell
[1:21:20] here comes a prophet
[1:21:22] he said not ever israelite down through
[1:21:24] there but he said a predestinated
[1:21:28] group of people
[1:21:30] will be given white robes
[1:21:36] and according to the book of revelations
[1:21:39] they're given white robes
[1:21:42] before the 144 000 are killed
[1:21:48] that's what the scripture says
[1:21:50] given white rose and said you know
[1:21:52] rest and wait because until your fellow
[1:21:54] brethren are killed
[1:21:58] what about telling those israelites
[1:22:02] paul
[1:22:04] paul knew some things
[1:22:07] he said he's taken up to the third
[1:22:09] heaven
[1:22:10] saw things he couldn't talk about
[1:22:14] but yet he wasn't the end time prophet
[1:22:15] so he couldn't tell us about it
[1:22:17] right
[1:22:19] so he just got his mouth shut he
[1:22:20] wouldn't like everybody else i think
[1:22:22] it's just i think thing that they didn't
[1:22:23] know one of my new thoughts ain't worth
[1:22:25] two cents
[1:22:29] but don't you think it'd be a wonderful
[1:22:30] thing for that for john
[1:22:34] to look and see
[1:22:38] they're on patmos
[1:22:42] that's 1995-96 remember
[1:22:45] so by then
[1:22:46] john would have already
[1:22:49] probably been well acquainted with
[1:22:50] apostle paul
[1:22:52] right
[1:22:55] but paul was killed somewhere in
[1:22:58] what in the 50s i guess i'm just giving
[1:23:00] dates i don't know exactly but i know
[1:23:02] the patmos vision was 80 95 96 so john
[1:23:05] had already been with paul and probably
[1:23:07] talked to paul about paul why in the
[1:23:08] world did you write
[1:23:10] that all israel to be saved he said i
[1:23:12] don't know
[1:23:13] i don't know
[1:23:15] maybe just cause a lot of people
[1:23:19] and i'll be a castaway for them is that
[1:23:21] scripture
[1:23:24] but he says
[1:23:26] john i believe god showed that to me
[1:23:31] john leaves and he comes back
[1:23:36] oh done gone so he couldn't explain it
[1:23:38] to him
[1:23:40] john comes back seeing that fifth sealed
[1:23:42] jew
[1:23:44] sure he couldn't understand fully about
[1:23:46] it come on
[1:23:51] but rather said he opened one of those
[1:23:53] seals and let john say his name
[1:23:55] so if he surely was the writer of those
[1:23:57] things and those fifth seals you come up
[1:23:59] there and
[1:24:00] you think paul wouldn't be happy to see
[1:24:02] him
[1:24:04] i spoke of it
[1:24:07] john comes along and said
[1:24:09] i saw him
[1:24:12] but you see one of these days we're
[1:24:13] gonna see him
[1:24:18] so all israel will be saved not ever
[1:24:20] israelite not every jew
[1:24:22] no the predestinated
[1:24:26] because only the predestinated in the
[1:24:28] bride amen that's gonna make it
[1:24:32] think about it
[1:24:33] see take something looks like it goes
[1:24:34] that way look like it goes that way
[1:24:36] you just give it a little time right
[1:24:39] and it'll come together
[1:24:41] and when it does you got something you
[1:24:43] walk on amen
[1:24:49] something you can stand on and say
[1:24:53] it sure did look like it was contrary
[1:24:55] but now i see
[1:25:00] now i understand because the prophet has
[1:25:02] brought the message come on brother
[1:25:04] the prophet has brought the message
[1:25:07] and now
[1:25:09] i
[1:25:10] see
[1:25:12] i can see back that way i can see over
[1:25:14] that way
[1:25:16] i can see what they
[1:25:18] get
[1:25:19] and i've seen what
[1:25:20] i get
[1:25:24] the plan of redemption
[1:25:30] what about him
[1:25:33] see it's coming together all of the
[1:25:35] things
[1:25:38] that we used to think were mysteries
[1:25:42] you know that we bad this you know a lot
[1:25:43] of people in the message are still
[1:25:45] preaching the mystery and i do too of
[1:25:47] the engrafting of the gentiles but you
[1:25:48] know we preached out the baptist church
[1:25:51] because we could read the scriptures
[1:25:53] that didn't mean we understood it but we
[1:25:54] praised it
[1:25:57] that's what i'm saying about oral
[1:25:58] roberts university
[1:26:00] now they can take this message and tell
[1:26:02] you exactly what brother brown said
[1:26:07] but it's also like i told you when was
[1:26:08] up our jeff that time
[1:26:10] about 78
[1:26:13] 60 excuse me
[1:26:16] and billy paul come out there and told
[1:26:17] him that the world council of churches
[1:26:19] is just sent a court order for us to
[1:26:22] send them a church age book
[1:26:25] why the world you want to do that for
[1:26:28] all you gotta do is go down there and
[1:26:30] pick up a whole truckload
[1:26:32] you can't use that as evidence
[1:26:38] right
[1:26:40] see now the computers are out there
[1:26:45] the law can use spread around them
[1:26:46] against you
[1:26:52] they said you believe everything he said
[1:26:54] yeah i don't believe it
[1:27:00] well he said he'd be over in 77.
[1:27:04] you can't explain to them
[1:27:06] that he didn't say that right
[1:27:09] they just give you quotes
[1:27:13] see it's all set up now to where they
[1:27:15] can anytime they want to they can take
[1:27:17] us
[1:27:19] but the thing about it is they're not
[1:27:20] going to be able to do very much with us
[1:27:22] because
[1:27:23] what i love about it
[1:27:24] when the enemy comes in like a flood the
[1:27:26] spirit of the lord will raise up a
[1:27:28] standard
[1:27:29] i'm not concerned
[1:27:31] yes
[1:27:32] we may hit hard times and
[1:27:36] maybe need to get rid of some of these
[1:27:37] bellies we got
[1:27:40] too
[1:27:44] many we're not going through the
[1:27:46] tribulation but persecution can be upon
[1:27:49] us
[1:27:51] in a great way
[1:27:54] he said well what if it don't well if it
[1:27:56] don't i'm happy
[1:27:58] but if it does
[1:28:00] you're gonna have to admit this old boy
[1:28:02] took you in the face and told you it's
[1:28:04] coming so now which one's gonna be
[1:28:06] embarrassed
[1:28:12] that way you can grin
[1:28:16] and say like i did
[1:28:17] 1974.
[1:28:19] i said we could price the year 2026
[1:28:22] and not break bread around semesters
[1:28:25] proved it by his message by the quotes
[1:28:28] you know nobody don't want to know how
[1:28:30] to come up with that
[1:28:33] they think it's just a prediction
[1:28:35] but you know what
[1:28:36] obviously all of them said it's going to
[1:28:38] be overweight in 77 and you know it
[1:28:40] wasn't over with
[1:28:44] so i'm still grinning yeah and if it
[1:28:47] passes the year 5000
[1:28:49] i'll still be grinning of course i'll be
[1:28:51] a little old
[1:28:56] take on these things
[1:28:58] comparing
[1:29:00] those things compare the book of
[1:29:02] revelations with the book of daniel
[1:29:03] sometimes just read them together
[1:29:06] and just read it and read it
[1:29:14] jesus
[1:29:31] i believe he's still a savior
[1:29:38] i believe he's here to take care of us
[1:29:55] um
[1:30:33] believe in your words
[1:30:49] right
[1:31:02] else
[1:31:41] thank you
[1:31:55] anybody else
[1:32:38] and remember brother boyd's sister
[1:32:41] they still haven't operated here
[1:32:44] they're afraid to operate them because
[1:32:46] you don't have enough pain
[1:32:48] and thanks to being able to have an
[1:32:51] operation all right
