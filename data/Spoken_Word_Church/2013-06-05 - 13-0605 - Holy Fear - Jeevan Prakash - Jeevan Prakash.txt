of instance the man is a farmer or maybe is a shopkeep shop worker and nobody pays any attention to him but let him get a job on the police force and come down the street there's a policeman with his badge and uniform on where maybe someone wouldn't speak to him a day before hello there John how are you see why is it it's kind of an A or a fear or a disrespect because of it maybe he gets elected to the mayor of the city or maybe and that the because of that God is God he deserves a respect amen that's right and we have got to respect him and give a fear to him and that brings respect amen God has demanded that for himself and all his servants God demands respect for his servants are we respecting the servant of God are we honoring the servant of God when we respect the servant of God we are respecting God his servants how we know that they are his servants because he indicates these servants by his word huh he takes these servants and makes them Servants of God and proves that they are servants by making his word work through them servants then as you respect that servant you respect God so when I respect you and you respect me and we respect each other then we are respecting God same thing you know sometimes we say I love God I love God I love God I love God but you hate your brother oh you hate your sister how can you say that you love the Lord huh nobody has seen God
