second service alright so we can get our food lined up looks like we're going to have a few people come we need to get our game plan together we're going to have spaghetti and meatballs which is going to be real simple side a side salad and a roll and then some of the sisters are going to fit so Kate and let's don't lay it all on one sister to make all the gates know let's all pitch in and kind of do like we did the only here when burly's camp when we cook for it it's kind of all ppm to my temper hot dog buns onions ketchup mustard pickles no spaghetti meatballs we're gonna throw the salad out there in a bowl and give them a couple of dressings and a roll and move it right along so and I think that everybody likes that there's some kids don't like numbers no I know I know Bella she had she had a revival meeting tonight when I told her little town spaghetti thing y'all not fingers she makes it herself that's why she likes you like yeah it's not her up she needs to you know she'll be part of the use she can't do that me okay but let's keep their buying up in the prayers for the we have another table the dark traveling to come and that will have a safe and wonderful time in reward the Landrieu Glover is coming in on Friday he'll be staying with me in a minute sweetheart and then we will have regular service on Sunday but the youth will be conducting the Sunday afternoon service just like always D'Angelo ain't no little part of that John says Annabelle had to drive around because he was 15 years old hearty preaching yeah call brother he's he's rather skinny now he may not married and his wife is trending down I guess but the guys to same good brother good brother angry hey yeah I thank you all right so now we've been talking about the search agents now we know we done took the rapture yes so let's go through this one more time and after this after what after this after the church ages after this which was chapter one two three of Revelation after this I looked and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking to me so we know it was the Lord speaking to John typing the bride saying come up hither right and I will show thee things which must be Hereafter now remember the bride goes up in chapter 4:1 this is when the bride believes the earth because the turqu ages are over if I got that okay now it's giving we're going to look at thee these are heavenly scenes that we're going to look at her here for a minute because you can't take revelations in five and say it happen that for the rapture you got to have a revelation about this folks I mean you can't just it's not chronologically in order nobody got that it's not we know chapter one two and three but now remember chapter one takes you back to the beginning of the church ages through the church ages and they are in order chapter four is an order as we go the bride of Jesus Christ the born-again believers go up in Chapter four actually for one John topping the bride so we're following John as you would follow the voice of God because he he he heard that voice now I believe it was that same voice that spoke to John it's didn't turn around one that talked to John while Jesus was here on earth so he understood the voice that's why I believe John was commissioned to do all this because John was young and he was with him the whole time right and he was able to understand that this voice he had heard before you and I same way need to hear that same voice say come up hither now come up hither has two meanings come up hither is an actual rapture but if you don't come up hither in Revelation and show these things which must be Hereafter same way with us we have a we have a brother any calls an updated revelation right we don't have to read the newspaper we know what's going to happen we've already bent by the prophet of God and now that getting us through all that we have been put in a place to where like oh they'll say last Sunday with man and brother Bob bro the lease has been preaching about we don't have to worry about what's going on in the world right it should not affect us spiritually now physically when we know that because we live in LA but see we live in the pressure way out of sin but it should not bother us or make us nervous if you're nervous then you need to check you you need to check your spirituality if you're nervous about what's going on okay but we still need to be diligent we still need to be humans use our human brain and I believe we have I believe brother Dale this has took action I think about this morning because there are several churches in the message that Cobra has gotten into just for a second and a couple of big name preachers of God and they're in the hospital but that's not saying one thing about them I'm just telling you brother Dale the first thing he done was he grabbed a prayer cloth and he went applaud him over every door every door in this church has done prayer cloth over it specifically to keep that coating out of this church now I'm just gonna believe that I'm just gonna be dumb enough I think tracks loss will be put everywhere and supernatural things happen so God knows our heart we want to worship God brother Dale when I keep this church going but you don't want them he would not want to make you a target for this thing that's coming around in the world but because the reason I'm saying this is is because I thinking the other day I'm doing the series on the on the you know we start with the Passover but I thought the other day and it's a little bit comical but but it's not it's what God would do because he told the children of Israel he said God said I'm gonna lay these plagues on Israel I mean on Egypt but they're not going to thank you right when it was so dark you couldn't see I was thinking other than just a little just a little given and it's the way I think you know here comes here comes out of the israelian into work into the brick house he's getting ready to make bricks and then here comes Earl the Egyptian in and he looks like ants left three four days he's done balls all over his face he's inching everywhere and and this you know I was ready to go to work he said he's a minute pieces from children of Israel he had no he had no problems in his bed he had no locusts in his hair he had no fleas in his bed but this other God has it's all because remember these rays would all I mean or Israel would go to work they were slaves lit well here the taskmasters are standing there like that you know and everybody knows but see us have got protective people if you'll just take him at his word then you made this word and walk straight on they knew they were the children of Israel and you've got would protect them if you get a revelation like that you ain't gotta worry about Egypt so this one ever worried about Egypt Egypt was always trying to hold on to that the Israeli they were trying to hold on to that group of people to make them work but as we're going to talk about this afternoon finally the Passover came debt came in the count and Pharaoh finally said leave you know I've had enough of this so you know what the devil one day will do the same thing he'll try his best he'll try his best but you remember though as I've been reading also in chronicles and in Kings some of the Kings worshipped God and God blessed them some of the Kings didn't worship done and God brought plagues on them so you have to be careful and say well I'm a Christian nothing can happen to me Don don't be silly no don't tempt God but there's a place we have to go though to where that that we stay with the children of Israel and that we can live in Goshen and that we can that God can protect us from what's coming this is just a pimple of what's coming this is not even this ain't even close to what's coming when we get out of here so anyway so we're fixing to leave now we're leaving here as the pride but we have to come back watch what I'm saying revelation 4 is the scene in heaven not on earth because we're we've come up we're gonna be like I said before we're gonna be for three and a half years the seat now what I took I took my peanuts there here I know I was hoping they weren't there at the bomb plant is a it up at the fire last night tell me all these get that there was no man I used to work with chicken flat they tell me I drop something he said but we're not working at the bomb plant they be our last day so this is a three and a half years that you and I are going to be away from the earth if I got that but from four one two revelations 19 it's not three and a half years yeah I got that that's right so you got dual meaning that's not it's not exactly when we leave yeah we're going to come back to Revelation 19 we're going to come back but remember how many years were left after the rapture 14th and Daniel 7 u8 7 years not three and a half so this is going to take place in a seven-year period ok then I got that now revelations for though is a scene in heaven Revelations 5 that's the scene in heaven but remember brother branham emphatic Lee tells us in Revelation chapter 6 that the seals are broken earth none at him so 4 and 5 we're going to talk about a heavenly scene okay revelation 6 we got to come back to earth and he's going to literally break those seals on earth he breaks them to us spiritually breaks them to the world naturally have I got that right then and you've gone revelation 7 8 9 10 even 11 12 13 you've got the United States involved in the image to the beach we won't be here 14 15 we'll keep reading a little bit like 16 17 18 19 it's when we come back alright so as a timeline as that you and I are going to be here we won't not now listen I've told you a hundred times this is a hundred and first time if you don't able to get a revelation into anything get a revelation one thing you don't have to go through the tribulation if you're born again you are have got a free trip up here and then you've got people in the message in the house and your way what people say but then they go well what are we gonna do for them seven years if you say it's three and a half wheels are gonna help there's nowhere in the Bible that it says the man suffers three-and-a-half you show it to me right away nowhere in the bible does it say we're going to be in heaven in a wedding supper it just says the marriage supper of the lamb no brother branham brings them in that's three and a half years when God's dealing with the Jews we're off Mary so if I got that but we know according to the Bible that thing that has to be seven earthly years left after we leave after church leaves to fulfil dang seventy weeks because nineteen seventy weeks will be fulfilled when we ride back in the Millennium after they build a temple that's how important it is to see damn seventy weeks in that there's not just three and a half years left after the rapture but I have told somebody one time before I said I really this is my intro I don't care what can happen I don't care what we're gonna eat they doesn't matter just get down and then it'll all be made known to us and you know what we're in eternity anyway this time elements gonna be back down here on this earth because we've already look from right here we have took a body change we have entered into the eighth day in body we don't have listen time was no longer inside of you when you got morning in but we're still in time obviously we have more slowly right but one day though Abraham woke up and he didn't have to crawl out of bed he jumped up out there because he was changed back to a 20 year old young man so we take a change right here that's final in the Bible this one revelation 4:1 tells you there was a group of people that had a revelation of a resurrection there was a resurrection of the dead Saints that were born again all down through the church ages right here in this one scripture we took a body change and we the director with them doughnuts nobody on the earth at this point there's no one on the earth except two witnesses 144,000 and all the other whatever you want to call them who the Spurgeon people will never get eternal life the Beast the Catholic Church you have counterpart at the Catholic Church still be here but we will not so let's don't worry about how long the time we got but we must place it to be able to see the book of Revelation you can't see the book of Revelation for that same 1970 week you cannot you can't place it there is nowhere you can place it anywhere in scripture unless you understand seven movies a day because when we leave right here when that when that period when he says come up here there no you think period rest of the image to the youth that's my brother around so in fact the rest of them now for one I mean four and five is heavenly same with six one is the plates being poured out and all the vowels and all based on people on earth and wonderful for thousands call them you're not going to be here but we have to have every scripture revealed to us spiritually because we are spiritual view just like today there's a natural jus that's gonna naturally things going to happen but you and I are Jews and spiritual that's baked because we can go back to the Old Testament and we can relive the Passover not as killing over the coming of a baby sheep yes we know that it's a simple and tight that the Lamb of God came God came on earth and He gave His life on the Passover day the very day they killed the lamb they were killing two lambs at one time they were killing Jesus the perfect lamb and they were killing a regular lamb because it was Passover he died on exactly the day that they killed the Passover lamb and then we know what happened after that but we just going to stick on Passover right now so on upstairs with me so now immediately I was in the spirit so watch he wasn't he wasn't in the natural you know in other words he was sure he was standing on her but God took him up to a place to show them things that must be Hereafter I'm telling you this because you and your human brain are going to come back to earth with a bunch of this stuff of this of this scripture don't do that it's a heavenly scene because number one I throw them what's that in heaven and one sat on the throne now there's revelations of one God Peter said I look like Jasper and sardine stone it was a rainbow about the throne now like brother Graham stated you'll read in the church age book we only stay a half rainbow and he quotes of the the song that happens you have been told we got a half but when we get to heaven that's a full rainbow is so it's a full revelation and I believe that's what we're getting right now we got to have a full revelation here to take it to that place okay leave we can't have a half revelation we gotta have a full revelation because remember the four words been made known in the end time that's what's going to change our body say John couldn't take the change God didn't take him up in flesh I don't believe because he said it was immediately I was in the spirit so God took him maybe like he did brother Brown in a vision or cooking over into another dimension and let him watch the stain of what was going to happen and you say well that's impossible how do you think Moses wrote the first five books of the Bible when he wasn't there basically almost the first two he was not there in the book of Genesis the whole Genesis was written from Moses watching television it was a vision yeah I believe I'm justice I believe that even when brother Brown my belief when he was discerning those people you watch you heat in that film he's never looked at them eyeball to eyeball he's looking off to the side he's watching the screen pop up and God shows him these people in their blue suit that comes to 245 he actually sees the guy doing this in his 2 4 or 5 Mulberry Street so he's seen the vision he see him but you remember a lot of things were the past we can deal with that the law that was in the future so we know it had to be God god only knows the future and he don't right so God was giving him a projection or a revelation what he saying by the way we gotta have that same thing maybe not a television screen opened up but we have a prophet come a porter a gamekeeper my doorkeeper and he opened the door and he not only went in and come out and told us what was going on we get to go in yes okay if not then we program left worked up we're done we're waiting on another Porter to stand in that no open in heaven brother Brown gave us the most updated heavenly revelation of anybody on earth except Jesus and they hardly understood him I call him a devil I called him all kind of different thing that's what's special about our day God send us a prophet that he could go up in the spirit and see these things as the eagle he could see these things and come tell us about that's it I like what brother Klaus Weisinger says you know brother Browns tells you many many times he said I just can't keep a secret I just can't keep a secret thank God he can't keep a secret that's my brother Brown that's why I got put brother Graham on the earth and giving the revelation so it went he went keeping the secret he tell it to us all right just like typing Abraham because why did they were hell mighty God go to Abraham somebody ready the other night because he knew that Abraham would tell his generation that will tell the next generation that because remember they didn't help cell phones iPads and they wrote they literally had to speak to the next generation and they would write it down or or would tell the story and they had to be highly accurate because how many times of you and I heard a story that became third person and fourth person and there was a little part left down right our attitude under the crest so you can't add in the word I take away from the words I think right so they had to be so that's why Moses I believe God just didn't speak to Moses I believe he showed him what happened in the garden he showed him what happened in Abraham's life he showed Moses his own death he got off Moses wrote I'm dying he's on death connie wrote the first five books in the Bible so it to me you ought to be so humble that you can that we can sit in there talk about if not just makes that enough here but all of us can see not see but and understand when somebody says something I was in the spirit you go no no we know exactly what happened God took him up in Revelation and showed him things to come right and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne he the steps look like a desperate we never go get paying for the revelation and there was a rainbow about the throne and in sight like unto an emerald a brother Graham called that emerald light remember mm-hmm and round about the throne were more in 20 seats and upon these seats I saw four and twenty elders now what are the four and twenty elders recovering it's like we covered again twelve patriarchs in the Old Testament if I got that and twelve apostles in the New Testament so John had to see yourself sitting there but remember is in a vision okay that's alright so can't see yourself in a vision brother I'm so I self in the video all right all right go around about the throne were four twenty states and upon the seats I saw four and 20 elders sitting clothed in white raiment know where they were all at all I had a holy go he's a binman Old Testament yeah they're giving the Holy Ghost about this time they got it nothing here how you gonna happy gonna get them where they're at without imparting the Holy Ghost to them if I got that never okay with that okay you got to be careful you cuz see you Monica go back say well then gift about this behold ago no now he related you notice I didn't say me birth either I said the baptism of the Holy go kalenna John the man has got the baptism the Holy Ghost but he didn't get from your birth go backstage no one until Jesus died could have an indwelling of the new birth no one not even Adam Adam was imparted right Adam was in part of the eternal life he didn't receive the new birth no one in the Old Testament you can't give somebody the new birth when you got bulls and goats and all these animals you gotta sacrifice all it done was covered sin until Christ come the Passover we're going to talk about today's the Passover lamb so so these you said all the great apron oh yeah watch my brother prime say the Prophet brother around of many many times he said see what these people did without the baptism of Holy go right in the Old Testament that's what should make us ashamed it's because we got it inside of us they had an indwelling them on their spirit realm after so long in the spirit realm to anoint them to do David but look at them although they all had a flaw somewhere that you and I wouldn't have that flaw David wouldn't had the flaw of watching Bathsheba take a bath because brother Graham said then the Holy Ghost would make you turn away from a naked woman see but he didn't have that indwelling and that desire was still there so he took Bathsheba so that proved he did have them you learn then you birth changes from all that this okay am i okay with that only until they 120 in the upper room was there an indwelling of the Holy Ghost except for Adam who was in part of eternal life as a full-grown man not as a baby memory didn't grow as a baby he repeat he came here as a full-grown man right so I want to make that I want to make that point but now here there sitting what did the Holy Ghost but they're not bright now the 12 the plots of law but the 12 apostles top the bride with 12 patriarchs got the Old Testament saying if I got that 12:12 and they're sitting here now remember this is a scene in heaven because literally they are somewhere right now literally they're all somewhere but they're not sitting together yet okay now brother Graham did see him on the sixth dimension either he saw his people so we got dimensions inside of dimension okay around about the throne were four and 20 seats for 20 elders sitting clothed in white raiment and they had on their heads crowns of gold they had come to the position they come to a place and we need to go we need to go and now the throne feel I have done voices of seven well we'll get you that right there like we did like sleep we'll try to get to latinum no mistakes let's go we try and get out of here by him laughing
