[16:15] and then all of us all in the same way
[16:17] so and we'll be doing the
[16:21] newlywed game too so you better get to
[16:23] know your spouse a little bit quicker
[16:25] a little bit more some of you don't know
[16:28] anything about your spouse so anyway
[16:31] but um we always have fun and we'll have
[16:34] fun in the lord too we
[16:36] want to thank brother dale in the church
[16:39] for always furnishing everything
[16:43] and always supporting it so
[16:46] it's good for the couples
[16:50] to uh just kind of have a night out like
[16:53] terrence said though
[16:54] now is the time to get your babysitters
[16:57] because they won't be bringing no
[16:58] cheering this is just adults only
[17:02] tickles me when i say that certain
[17:05] brother stood up here one day and said
[17:06] he waited till his grandkids went to bed
[17:08] and they went and watched an adult movie
[17:13] brother dick knew what he was talking
[17:15] about but nobody else did
[17:17] he meant a movie like a war movie or
[17:19] something he could watch but he was
[17:21] he was we were all stunned when he said
[17:23] that but that's kind of the way it is
[17:25] we're going to do adult things when we
[17:26] get
[17:27] there and have fun in the lord and uh
[17:32] i thank god for my spouse you couldn't
[17:33] get like brother
[17:35] um john hit it on the head he said that
[17:38] was my better half
[17:40] and some of you would say bitter but
[17:42] it's a better half
[17:44] you're better half but thank goodness
[17:46] for valentine's day i i'm
[17:48] i'm hoping everybody spends valentine's
[17:50] day every day with their spouse amen
[17:52] because because if that's what the lord
[17:55] gave you bud
[17:57] brother the prophet of god said outside
[17:59] of salvation that's the greatest thing
[18:02] god could compliment a man with is a
[18:04] beautiful spouse
[18:06] amen and the character that she brings
[18:10] because you know what that's our
[18:11] character because we're the bride of
[18:12] jesus christ so that's our
[18:14] character showing to jesus christ what
[18:15] we think of him
[18:17] to hear on the earth and he is happy for
[18:20] us to be his bride
[18:21] amen so let's go to first john 4.
[18:25] brother colley read been reading the
[18:26] scripture so he responsive read it this
[18:29] morning
[18:29] but he read a lot of it and we're just
[18:31] going to read one through six
[18:33] but we're not i told you we're going to
[18:34] finish but i i found there's one more
[18:36] little item we need to cover
[18:38] today and like i said before please
[18:42] please remember one thing i am not
[18:46] speaking of any one person
[18:49] we're talking about spirits there's two
[18:51] spirits that we got to deal with
[18:53] not people spirits now you can get
[18:56] possessed with them and then you become
[18:58] one with it but
[19:00] it's the two spirits that we're dealing
[19:02] with the spirit of christ and the spirit
[19:03] of the antichrist all right
[19:05] and that's the two things that we're
[19:06] dealing with and we also have to deal
[19:08] with
[19:10] and not speaking against any
[19:12] denomination you heard the prophet
[19:14] talking about it you know but
[19:16] there is a thing that god hates he hates
[19:19] nicoletism
[19:20] he hates the conquering of the laity so
[19:23] if god hates it we got to hate it
[19:25] if god hates it we hate it god saw what
[19:27] it would do to the people
[19:28] we see what it's doing to the people
[19:30] it's binding them and not making them
[19:32] free in the lord
[19:33] so before we read the scripture let's
[19:35] bow our heads the heavenly father thank
[19:37] you for this
[19:38] day that you give us another opportunity
[19:40] to come and serve you lord we pray now
[19:41] that you would just bless us
[19:43] with your presence lord we appreciate
[19:46] the song service we just had lord to
[19:48] feel the presence of the lord now
[19:50] lord this is another anointing lord
[19:52] where you speak to your people father
[19:53] and i pray that you would move this
[19:54] vessel out of the way and just speak
[19:56] through it father
[19:57] do the revealing lord you do the
[19:59] speaking father just be with the ones
[20:01] that are sick
[20:02] the ones that are not here the ones that
[20:03] are hindered father in many different
[20:04] ways we pray that you would just
[20:06] unbind lord the ones that are bound
[20:10] and you can only do it lord thank you by
[20:12] asking you father and the word
[20:13] says that you would do it for us forgive
[20:16] us of our many sins and mistakes lord
[20:17] that we make
[20:18] just be with us and guide us in jesus
[20:20] name we pray
[20:21] amen first john four verse one now today
[20:23] we're going to talk about two spirits
[20:25] same thing separation time part two
[20:28] because there's got to be a separation
[20:31] if god hates something
[20:34] and he's in you then you're going to
[20:36] hate it but i'm going to show you in the
[20:38] very end that's what i didn't get to
[20:39] last on wednesday night is
[20:41] is they're going to hate you just like
[20:44] they hate jesus and they're going to
[20:46] kill you thinking they're doing god's
[20:48] service
[20:49] that's happened since the dawn of time
[20:53] amen that's happened since the dawn of
[20:56] time man has
[20:57] killed christians thinking they were
[20:59] doing god's service
[21:01] amen and then we're talking about the
[21:03] seals
[21:04] which are in the bible according to the
[21:05] book of revelations
[21:07] there in six altered revelations eight
[21:10] and we see that the seventh seal
[21:13] there was silence in heaven for a space
[21:14] of a half an hour
[21:16] there was nothing to be revealed is what
[21:19] the prophet said so let's read this
[21:20] beloved believe not every spirit
[21:22] but try the spirits whether they are of
[21:24] god because many false prophets are
[21:25] going out into the world
[21:27] hereby know ye the spirit of god every
[21:30] spirit that confesses that jesus christ
[21:32] is coming the flesh is of god
[21:34] and every spirit that confesses not that
[21:36] jesus christ has come in the flesh
[21:38] is not of god and as i told you before
[21:39] it's not just words it's not just
[21:41] something you say
[21:44] you gotta literally believe that man
[21:46] walked on earth 2000 years ago but that
[21:48] same man that walked on earth 2000 years
[21:50] ago in spirit form today is inside of
[21:52] you
[21:52] same guy not another person same guy
[21:56] and every spirit that confesses not that
[21:58] jesus christ is coming the flesh is not
[21:59] of god
[22:00] and this is that spirit of antichrist
[22:03] whereof ye have heard that it should
[22:05] come and even now already is in the
[22:07] world 2 000 years ago
[22:09] year of god little children have
[22:10] overcome them because greater see this
[22:12] in you than he that's in the world
[22:14] they are of the world therefore speak
[22:15] they of the world and the world heareth
[22:17] them
[22:18] we are of god he that knoweth god
[22:20] heareth us
[22:21] he that is not of god hereth not us
[22:23] hereby know we
[22:25] the spirit of truth and the spirit of
[22:27] error and you may be seen in the lord
[22:28] that is blessing
[22:29] to reading the word i want to hurry
[22:31] through this a little bit at first
[22:33] not so much but let's read the first
[22:35] first john 5
[22:37] verse 18 it says we know look at this or
[22:39] we
[22:40] know john we know that whosoever is born
[22:43] of god sentence not
[22:46] but he that is begotten of god now
[22:48] brother dale's talking about begotten
[22:50] we have we are begotten by a lively hope
[22:53] we
[22:54] are not begotten of god by our first
[22:57] birth
[22:58] our first birth was a carnal knowledge
[23:01] of a man and a woman getting together
[23:03] and by desire
[23:05] not according to god but allowed by god
[23:09] to get you here
[23:11] makes that your second birth is more
[23:13] important than your first birth
[23:15] once you get born but you got to get
[23:17] born first time first
[23:18] right but as brother dale said that
[23:20] genesis 1 26 man is not all mankind it's
[23:23] not every person that walks on the face
[23:25] of the earth
[23:25] because not everybody is the children of
[23:27] god by that
[23:29] birth by that begetting or begotten
[23:32] remember jesus christ is the first
[23:33] begotten of the father
[23:35] well if he's the first begotten who's
[23:37] arrest
[23:38] we are the rest we're the rest of the
[23:41] begotten of the father in other words if
[23:43] there's a
[23:44] beginning of the creation of god that
[23:46] constitutes that something began but
[23:49] if that's the only person the bible
[23:50] should have just said he's the only one
[23:54] no paul keeps talking telling us many
[23:57] times he's be
[23:58] he's begetting or begotten us to what to
[24:01] a lively hope he he begot us
[24:04] all right so by our second birth know
[24:06] you not whosoever is born of god sinneth
[24:08] not that didn't say whoever's born of
[24:09] mom and daddy
[24:11] that says whoever is born of god by your
[24:14] new birth
[24:15] sinneth not but he that is begotten of
[24:17] god keepeth himself
[24:18] and that wicked one toucheth him not now
[24:21] sometimes we get up in the morning and
[24:22] don't
[24:23] kind of think that scripture's telling
[24:25] the truth
[24:26] but it is that inside man is who he's
[24:29] talking about he's not talking about the
[24:30] outside guy
[24:32] talk about the inside guy that wicked
[24:33] one toucheth him not because listen if
[24:35] you're born again
[24:36] your soul is a hot fire coal that satan
[24:38] can't touch
[24:40] he can't touch it he can't even play
[24:42] with your soul it's sealed
[24:45] now you can play with your flesh and he
[24:46] can play with your spirit but he cannot
[24:48] play with that soul that soul is
[24:50] begotten of god
[24:51] it is god no no less no more
[24:57] that's what brother dale's trying to get
[24:58] us to see that we're god almighty and
[25:00] human flesh just like jesus was god
[25:02] almighty and human flesh
[25:03] except for the virgin birth amen
[25:07] but see if you negate your first birth
[25:09] then you are leaning towards your second
[25:11] birth and that's the one we need to look
[25:12] at
[25:14] and we know here's po john again and we
[25:17] know that we are of god
[25:19] and the whole world life and wickedness
[25:21] so the whole world is going to be
[25:22] against us
[25:23] i want to tell you today when we get
[25:26] toward the end of this thing remember
[25:27] one thing's for sure
[25:30] the bible tells us that we that the son
[25:32] of man
[25:34] would be in the end time just as he was
[25:36] when he walked on the earth in the days
[25:38] of the son of man what
[25:40] the myth in other words the mystery of
[25:42] god's going to be revealed the son of
[25:43] man is coming out what is the son of man
[25:45] god in human flesh and if they
[25:48] persecuted the
[25:49] son of man himself they're going to
[25:51] persecute me and you
[25:53] there was a division that
[25:56] the division was not what he they knew
[25:59] who he was
[26:00] as the person oh that's the carpenter
[26:03] boy or that's joseph's son or that's the
[26:04] illegitimate child
[26:06] but they they never come to an
[26:08] understanding that he was almighty god
[26:10] in human flesh
[26:12] came exactly the way how about a man
[26:14] standing up in a temple and say
[26:16] show me one place
[26:19] show me one now all they had was the
[26:21] torah the old testament they had the old
[26:22] testament show me one place
[26:24] where i don't fulfill all this right oh
[26:27] you're of your father the devil
[26:30] oh no no jesus said no you're of your
[26:32] father the devil
[26:33] because see they call they didn't call
[26:34] him just a devil they called him
[26:36] beelzebub the king of devils
[26:39] right now what are they going to do to
[26:40] me and you same thing
[26:42] but remember i'm going to read a quote
[26:46] in a minute that i read the other day
[26:47] but it really struck me to go back to
[26:49] read it again
[26:50] and i see why i read it because remember
[26:52] remember this is a journey
[26:55] it's not a one-day ordeal this is a
[26:57] journey
[26:59] all right it's like dave ramsey said
[27:01] this is not a this is not a
[27:03] we're not into a microwave religion
[27:07] this is the crockpot religion it takes a
[27:09] while to cook us and get us
[27:11] made and get us going we always want to
[27:13] go well i just want to be up there at
[27:14] the top of the pyramid when i get
[27:16] started no you can't do that
[27:18] you were a baby when you were born you
[27:20] did baby things you made baby mistakes
[27:23] and then you grew up and i hope you're
[27:25] not doing the baby things anymore
[27:27] amen and we know that the son of god has
[27:31] come
[27:32] and hath given us an understanding that
[27:35] we may know him
[27:36] that is true and we are in him that is
[27:39] true
[27:40] even in his son jesus christ this is the
[27:42] true god
[27:43] and eternal life all right so we good
[27:45] with that
[27:46] we know that the son of god has come and
[27:49] has given us an
[27:50] understanding now remember john is the
[27:53] only one that was commissioned
[27:55] jesus when he was on earth he pretty
[27:57] much told john
[27:58] if john would have got the revelation
[28:00] that john was going to live to see a
[28:01] second coming but not the literal second
[28:03] coming
[28:04] he was going to see it in the book of
[28:05] revelations by symbols
[28:08] he was going to see christ come to the
[28:10] church he was going to see him in the
[28:11] golden candlesticks
[28:12] he was going to see him come back in
[28:14] revelations 19 and all these
[28:16] things that he showed john but remember
[28:18] every other person
[28:21] every other person that was around jesus
[28:24] either left him or died
[28:28] either left him remember the 40 that
[28:31] left the 70 that left oh
[28:32] they left no more recording of that but
[28:35] the 11 that stayed
[28:36] 12. judas killed himself but the 11 that
[28:39] stayed
[28:40] they all died of martyr's death except
[28:42] one and that was john but john
[28:44] was given the commission to stay and
[28:47] live the length of life so he could what
[28:49] write this for me and you somebody had
[28:50] to record this
[28:52] so in this first john this is john
[28:55] telling you what god has given him
[28:57] because he
[28:58] knew he was walking with him remember he
[28:59] was the youngest he was just a little
[29:01] a little loud when jesus was around he
[29:03] was the one that was always around him
[29:04] and
[29:05] and laying on his bosom and all the
[29:06] things like that
[29:08] but right here he's an older man he's
[29:10] been to patmos he's been he
[29:11] had his life you know going up into the
[29:13] 90 year old and he'd been in his life
[29:15] and he says we know that we are of god
[29:18] and the whole world life and wickedness
[29:20] in other words at that time
[29:22] think about it at that time john had
[29:25] lost
[29:26] every 11 of the original disciples plus
[29:29] him number 12.
[29:31] 11 of the original disciples were dead
[29:34] they were all they were all gone he had
[29:36] seen them get murdered by what
[29:38] for what they believed
[29:42] now this may not be an exciting sermon
[29:45] today but it's the truth
[29:46] the separating time is going to show
[29:49] right
[29:50] who's got the goods his brother donny's
[29:53] daddy always said who's got the goods
[29:55] and who don't have the goods
[29:57] amen because there will be a separating
[30:00] time
[30:02] so let's read now an exposition of the
[30:04] seven church ages read this again as
[30:05] we've read it before
[30:06] christ in the true church is a
[30:08] continuation of the book of acts like i
[30:10] said before
[30:10] listen as we'll look down here in just a
[30:13] minute
[30:15] uh pilate said what is truth
[30:19] well then i i looked upon the internet
[30:20] which must be true
[30:23] you can laugh there were thirty thousand
[30:26] worldwide christian organizations
[30:28] and twelve hundred different christian
[30:31] organizations
[30:32] and just in the united states alone now
[30:35] god's not that confused
[30:38] no way and people have
[30:42] certain amounts of truth but jesus said
[30:44] i'm not
[30:45] part truth he said i am the truth the
[30:48] way the truth so now christ in the true
[30:50] church is a continuation of the book of
[30:52] acts
[30:53] now how is the difference in the true
[30:55] church and the false church
[30:57] there's not much difference
[31:01] we're not talking about evil out in the
[31:04] world
[31:04] bar rooms and prostitute no we're
[31:07] talking about
[31:08] two churches we'll talk see just a
[31:11] minute where
[31:11] they're intertwined you've got the tree
[31:14] of knowledge of good and evil and the
[31:16] tree of life
[31:17] in the garden of eden they now are grown
[31:19] together so much to
[31:21] most people
[31:24] come on somebody most people can't tell
[31:27] the difference
[31:29] because they said jesus said this will
[31:31] deceive the very elect if it were
[31:33] possible
[31:38] this good verse is evil that we've
[31:40] always
[31:41] we we hear people talk about good and
[31:44] evil and the fight between good and evil
[31:46] and yeah they might know what they're
[31:48] talking about but
[31:50] they don't really know what they're
[31:51] talking about good versus evil
[31:54] is doctrine good versus evil is not
[31:57] democrat and politic and republican it's
[31:59] not
[32:00] without there and out here no it's in
[32:02] here
[32:03] this is where the fight is the fight's
[32:06] right here
[32:08] but the book of revelation shows how the
[32:10] antichrist spirit would come into the
[32:11] church
[32:13] in other words intertwine it defile it
[32:14] make it lukewarm formal and powerless
[32:17] but it exposes satan revealing his works
[32:20] attempted destruction of god's people
[32:21] and destruct
[32:22] discrediting of god's word right down to
[32:24] the time he's counted in the lake of
[32:26] fire listen he still fights even though
[32:28] a thousand years he can't do anything
[32:31] what an adversary for a thousand years
[32:34] he can't touch anybody because he has
[32:35] nothing to work with
[32:37] but then a little while after that god
[32:39] releases him out of that
[32:41] prison out of that bottomless pit
[32:44] that's bible and he goes on a rampage
[32:47] again
[32:48] gets one more shot
[32:51] but his one more shot is as fruitless as
[32:54] the shots he's given now
[32:56] amen we may
[33:01] listen i like to do the things of the
[33:02] world as far as going outside me and jim
[33:04] we're
[33:05] kind of mapping out our whole year of
[33:07] festivals and things to plant in the
[33:09] garden and the beekeeping stuff
[33:11] and you know the thought came to me
[33:12] where the prophet of god he said if
[33:14] you're gonna
[33:15] plant potatoes he said go ahead and
[33:18] plant the potatoes if you're gonna get
[33:19] married tomorrow go ahead and get
[33:20] married tomorrow listen
[33:21] don't negate all your plans and just say
[33:23] all right i'm going to go home shut the
[33:24] doors
[33:25] because jesus is coming no go about your
[33:28] regular life
[33:30] but live your life like jesus is coming
[33:33] tomorrow
[33:34] so that you will be ready in the time
[33:36] that the thief that does come in the
[33:38] night
[33:38] to the true bride we're going to be
[33:41] called away folks and nobody's going to
[33:43] know it it's going to be such a little
[33:45] group
[33:48] a little group not even going to we're
[33:51] not gonna move
[33:52] the needle in population as far as the
[33:55] world goes
[33:56] listen if it was eight souls it was
[33:58] saved and that types of denominations
[34:00] and the
[34:00] foolish virgin and enoch was one man
[34:03] that took a body chain he went up and
[34:05] didn't go through any tribulation
[34:10] that's why i love this the revelation
[34:13] that we don't have to go through
[34:14] tribulation
[34:15] we might have to go through persecution
[34:17] but we will not have to go through
[34:18] tribulation
[34:19] and if you'll read in revelations i'm
[34:21] going back and reading the book of
[34:22] revelations you keep reading in
[34:23] revelations
[34:24] where the bible says that your skin is
[34:26] going to fall off of your bones while
[34:28] you're still alive
[34:29] now that's a nuclear explosion you know
[34:31] that because that's the
[34:33] the fallout that makes you but makes
[34:35] your skin fall off and all these
[34:36] different and
[34:37] people are going to cry to die
[34:41] and can't well
[34:46] if you're getting christ you won't have
[34:47] to worry about that
[34:49] see that's one of those fallacies that
[34:51] denominations teach you that we got to
[34:53] go through tribulation there's nowhere
[34:54] in the bible that the bride now the
[34:56] church does
[34:57] but there's no that's why i want to get
[34:58] into maybe some of these doctrinal
[35:00] issues
[35:01] and show how that that listen
[35:04] if you can't separate bride church and
[35:06] different
[35:07] you'll get them all mixed up right like
[35:10] the man did with brother brown he's a
[35:11] brother um how in the world can the
[35:12] bride be sitting here and the church be
[35:14] sitting here and this and me sitting
[35:15] here
[35:15] he said oh there's a difference between
[35:17] a bride and a church
[35:19] for this version church bride cup of
[35:22] water
[35:23] just regular centers there's a
[35:24] difference but you got to know the
[35:27] difference
[35:27] and able to read this book called the
[35:30] book of revelations amen
[35:32] he knows that if the people get the true
[35:33] revelation of the true church
[35:35] and what she is and what she stands for
[35:37] that she can do the greater work she
[35:38] will be an invincible army
[35:40] if they get a true revelation of the two
[35:42] spirits within the framework of the
[35:44] christian church
[35:45] and by god's spirit discern and
[35:47] withstand the antichrist spirit state
[35:48] will be powerless
[35:50] before her now let's go to that what is
[35:52] truth
[35:54] when we go back in the book of genesis
[35:56] and we look many
[35:58] many thousands of years ago there was
[36:01] two doctrines
[36:03] cain's doctrine and abel's doctrine
[36:06] amen cain's doctrine was wrong
[36:10] kane's doctrine was false cain's
[36:12] doctrine was not true
[36:15] abel's doctrine was true but who died
[36:21] cain killed abel because of his doctrine
[36:23] not because he found out he was his half
[36:25] brother
[36:28] he killed him because god gave
[36:31] notice to abel sacrifice and he told
[36:34] cain if you will change and do better
[36:38] i'll accept yours and cain said brother
[36:40] brown said take it or leave it buddy
[36:41] this is all i'm doing
[36:43] in other words my doctrine is right
[36:47] i don't care what you say in other words
[36:49] i don't care what the word says
[36:51] i'm going to do what my doctrine or my
[36:52] denomination says
[36:55] be careful be careful because that's
[36:58] cain
[36:59] and cain what did cain do cain's biggest
[37:01] mistake was as he walked out from the
[37:03] presence of the lord he
[37:04] left what could have saved him amen
[37:07] same way with you and me but then we see
[37:10] cain and abel but now what about judas
[37:12] and jesus
[37:13] they were in the same camp they were in
[37:15] the same place they were in the same
[37:16] church together
[37:18] judas was everywhere jesus was at he
[37:20] probably went to church more than the
[37:22] rest of them did
[37:23] because he was a money holder he was a
[37:25] guy that was right there and finally
[37:26] jesus said go do what you need to do
[37:30] and all the time he was the son of
[37:32] perdition or not the antichrist but he
[37:34] did have an antichrist spirit in him
[37:36] because he did not want anything to do
[37:39] with that doctrine that jesus was
[37:42] preaching
[37:44] now we come down to where to the book of
[37:46] revelations
[37:48] where we see there is what christ and
[37:51] the antichrist
[37:52] all right it starts as a beast it's
[37:55] going to end as a beast
[37:57] starts as a beast in the garden it's
[37:58] going to end with the beast in the end
[38:00] time
[38:00] but now i see iran comes about and we
[38:02] see and in nicea rome
[38:04] in 325 and 606 a.d we proved
[38:07] that there was people come from all over
[38:10] the world
[38:12] into this place and they were getting
[38:14] this new light
[38:17] you just heard what brother brown said
[38:18] this morning he said people from
[38:20] from irena's people from martin people
[38:22] from different ones
[38:24] came to that place but what did they do
[38:28] they were overpowered by the antichrist
[38:31] spirit
[38:32] because there was nothing of christ that
[38:33] came out of that
[38:36] all it was was romanism all it was was
[38:38] the changing of all doctrines listen the
[38:40] original doctrine i want you to
[38:42] somebody show me i we got the original
[38:44] doctrine
[38:45] there was no three gods there was no
[38:49] trinity
[38:50] there was no water baptism in the name
[38:52] of father son holy ghost there was no
[38:54] eternal hell there was no going through
[38:56] the tribulation there was none of that
[38:58] doctrine now sure there were
[39:00] little sayings as we got here before we
[39:02] read in first john 4 every spirit that
[39:04] confesses not to jesus
[39:05] come in the flesh look and it says it's
[39:07] already in the world take it to the next
[39:08] one
[39:09] and then we go to the opening of the
[39:10] book keep going a little bit further
[39:13] but it began as a saying it became began
[39:16] as a what a baby a little saying well i
[39:18] don't
[39:18] i don't know if that's right or not then
[39:21] it became a deed
[39:23] then it became a doctrine you know what
[39:25] they started building churches on that
[39:27] they started building their doctrines on
[39:29] that
[39:31] they went back and i never thought about
[39:33] but you heard it this morning where
[39:34] brother
[39:34] was talking about they went back and had
[39:36] an old testament
[39:37] they went back to an old testament form
[39:39] of of a
[39:41] priests and popes they went backwards
[39:45] they didn't go forwards they went
[39:48] backwards to apostolic secession and all
[39:50] these different things because that's
[39:51] really what the levites was
[39:53] the levite died his son took over if the
[39:56] son died the other one took over they
[39:58] had boys and they took over well that's
[39:59] kind of
[40:00] like they brought it over and also there
[40:02] was moses and then
[40:04] one thing i can't understand is is they
[40:06] had peter as the first pope
[40:08] and he had a wife and now their popes
[40:11] can't have wives
[40:15] i can't understand that right
[40:18] i mean the bible says that jesus prayed
[40:20] for peter's mother-in-law i kind of i
[40:21] guess that would mean he had a wife amen
[40:24] i'm glad you know what the bible put
[40:26] that in there to prove that doctrine
[40:29] but what it took it took a prophet to
[40:31] look at the roman catholic church and
[40:33] say
[40:34] you got peter's the first pope and he
[40:35] had a wife now your your popes can't
[40:37] have wives
[40:38] look at what they got theirself into by
[40:40] not having wives
[40:41] amen pretty good history about all that
[40:44] right
[40:44] we'll not get into it but it took the
[40:47] opening of the book it took the opening
[40:49] of the seals in the end time because
[40:50] really all these doctrines were shut up
[40:54] by that doctrine that came out in nicaea
[40:57] 325 and 606 amen
[41:00] and then it was accepted all the way
[41:02] through the dark ages it was accepted
[41:04] even in martin luther and it was
[41:05] accepted in john wesley
[41:06] but remember they had a piece of a
[41:08] message to bring
[41:11] the just shall live by faith apart from
[41:15] all that other stuff novena's crawling
[41:18] on the
[41:19] floor uh you know beating yourself and
[41:22] all those different things well
[41:23] well that's not bible the bible says
[41:26] believe
[41:29] faith comes by hearing and hearing by
[41:31] the word of god
[41:33] not by works not by the beating of
[41:35] yourself for paying no venues
[41:37] but look how low look how though that
[41:39] doctrine
[41:40] that was 606
[41:44] and here we are in 2021 and it's still
[41:47] going on
[41:49] but now you try to bring the doctrine of
[41:51] the first three church ages of
[41:53] no eternal hell and no water baptism in
[41:56] the name of father son holy ghost and
[41:57] all that
[41:57] you start trying to bring that over and
[42:00] interject it anywhere guess what happens
[42:02] you get put out of the house
[42:06] you see where i'm talking about those
[42:07] two spirits they're religious
[42:12] sometimes i'm kind of inclined that
[42:17] you can carry on a better conversation
[42:19] with a sinner than you can with somebody
[42:20] that
[42:21] that's uh that's supposed to be a
[42:23] christian because once you get somebody
[42:25] that's supposed to be a christian
[42:26] and and they're living in sin and
[42:28] they're drinking beer and they're
[42:29] cursing every few minutes and you start
[42:30] telling them that those things are wrong
[42:32] they ain't not gonna like you
[42:36] but if you tell a sinner he's a sinner
[42:37] he's like yep i am i know i am i'm
[42:39] drinking and smoking and gutting and all
[42:40] these effort
[42:41] you understand that's what we're going
[42:43] to get to here when we look and see
[42:46] where the prophet of god says the end of
[42:48] all things now remember
[42:51] technically the seventh seal
[42:55] is not the end of all things hold on i
[42:58] got a quote
[42:59] at the end of the seventh seal is the
[43:02] end of all things
[43:03] see that's the part that i didn't cover
[43:05] the other day because remember we're
[43:06] just like all the seven seals like
[43:09] all the first seals like remember the
[43:12] prophet says they overlap
[43:15] they lap from one to the other all right
[43:17] so you got a little bit coming in here
[43:18] in a little bit
[43:19] but i'll read it in just a second i'm
[43:20] getting a little ahead of myself well
[43:22] let's go to number two you got
[43:23] justification sanctification we believe
[43:25] in the baptism of the holy ghost
[43:27] an incarnate christ not an incarnate
[43:29] pope
[43:31] or incarnate cardinal or whatever you
[43:33] want to call it
[43:38] let's read number two now to get the
[43:39] real meaning of this
[43:41] i must caution you to ever keep in mind
[43:43] that religion
[43:45] is composed of two parts that intertwine
[43:49] but are as opposite as white black and
[43:53] white
[43:54] religion and the spiritual world are
[43:56] made of these two trees which had their
[43:58] roots in eden
[43:59] both the tree of life and the tree of
[44:01] knowledge of good and evil stood in the
[44:03] midst of the garden
[44:04] and no doubt their very branches
[44:06] intertwined each other
[44:08] thus in the ephesian church age is the
[44:10] same paradox the church is made up of
[44:12] good and bad
[44:13] two vines make the church they are like
[44:15] the wheat and tares growing up side by
[44:17] side but one is true the other is false
[44:19] now god will speak to each one now
[44:21] here's the here's the paradox
[44:23] is god will speak to each one god will
[44:26] let them believe a lie because he knows
[44:28] they're not going to believe the truth
[44:31] and he will talk about each one and he
[44:33] will call them the church
[44:35] and only the elect will really know
[44:38] which is the true spirit now see the
[44:40] only the elect can read the bible and
[44:42] say oh
[44:43] that's talking about the church oh
[44:45] that's talking about the bride oh
[44:47] that's talking about the foolish virgin
[44:52] you can't read the book of revelation
[44:54] and get it right
[44:56] without listening to the prophet sorry
[45:01] and led by the holy ghost led by the
[45:04] holy ghost listen to what the prophet
[45:06] said
[45:06] that's what a prophet does a prophet
[45:09] what interprets he's a divine
[45:11] interpreter
[45:12] not bringing in more or advertising
[45:14] taking no
[45:15] he gives us clarity to what's already
[45:19] been spoken
[45:20] and he will call them the church and
[45:21] only the elect will know which is the
[45:23] true spirit
[45:24] only the elect will not be deceived so
[45:26] there's your only the elect will not be
[45:28] deceived
[45:29] for matthew 24 24 says there arise false
[45:32] christ false prophets
[45:34] shall show great signs and wonders in so
[45:35] much that if it were possible
[45:37] they shall deceive the very elect so way
[45:40] back there in the early church a very
[45:41] short period after pentecost the false
[45:43] fine
[45:44] got to intertwine itself around the true
[45:46] vine we find these deeds of the
[45:48] nicolaitans and that spirit is going to
[45:50] be found
[45:50] finding the true vine look until it is
[45:53] destroyed by god
[45:56] now have you got it and it's going to be
[45:59] there according
[46:00] to matthew 13 jesus said in the parable
[46:03] they don't have this
[46:04] but while men slept the enemy came and
[46:06] sowed tares in other words the tares and
[46:08] the wheat both sprang up in the
[46:09] in the parable that jesus tells the
[46:12] servants of the household come and said
[46:13] sir
[46:14] did you not sow good seed in your field
[46:16] for where's these tares and he said look
[46:18] an
[46:18] enemy has done it the servant said well
[46:20] let's go in other words let's go and
[46:21] gather it up
[46:23] jesus said matthew 13 29 nay
[46:27] lest while you gather up the tares you
[46:29] root up the wheat in other words let
[46:30] them grow to harvest
[46:33] let them grow to harvest this is harvest
[46:35] time
[46:38] now that's why you gather up the tares
[46:40] you root up the wheat with them let both
[46:42] grow together
[46:43] until the harvest and in the time of
[46:45] harvest i will say to the reapers
[46:48] gather ye together first the tares and
[46:50] bind them in bundles
[46:51] separate them and burn them because
[46:54] remember
[46:55] what's going to happen there's only
[46:57] going to be
[46:58] in this new garden of eden there's only
[47:00] going to be the tree of life
[47:03] there will never be the tree of
[47:04] knowledge of good and evil after we take
[47:06] a body change and after we go into the
[47:09] marriage supper and after we get now
[47:11] remember
[47:12] be careful in the millennium it's still
[47:15] there
[47:16] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[47:18] because satan's not done away with
[47:21] but now in this future home this new
[47:22] home that we john saw come down out of
[47:24] heaven
[47:25] they won't be but one tree and that is
[47:28] the tree of life
[47:29] and you and i will be doing the same
[47:31] thing we'll be right there with that
[47:32] tree of life
[47:34] eating the fruit off of that tree hey
[47:37] man
[47:39] what a great day what makes your eyes
[47:41] water because you don't
[47:43] you do the thing you look at all this
[47:44] junk's going on in the world and man
[47:46] they're in an uproar about everything
[47:48] and
[47:49] and sure it kind of makes you a little
[47:50] bit nervous but you know what it
[47:52] shouldn't make you nervous we
[47:53] like i said before we've done red we've
[47:55] not read the book
[47:56] we don't read tomorrow's news today we
[47:59] had a prophet come tell us exactly what
[48:01] was going to happen
[48:02] so i have no qualms about who's in the
[48:05] white house because it's right there
[48:06] where god wants them
[48:07] right or whatever is going to happen in
[48:10] this world
[48:11] economy and everything else sure there's
[48:14] uncertainty
[48:14] many times but we look and we see that
[48:17] that
[48:18] the prophet told us though if we could
[48:19] get to what
[48:22] if we can know where those two spirits
[48:24] are
[48:25] withstand the antichrist spirit that god
[48:28] said we'd be an invincible army now how
[48:30] are you going to lose from that
[48:33] you can't lose but you've got to go
[48:36] through the journey as brother ram says
[48:37] i'll show you read it to yourself at the
[48:38] end of the seventh seal is the end of
[48:40] all things
[48:41] not at the beginning so there must be a
[48:43] beginning where the book is open but you
[48:44] and i have to go through a journey
[48:48] amen what did what did the first seal do
[48:52] the first rider the seal broke what
[48:54] happened the first rider rode off
[48:56] and the second seal didn't open until
[48:58] the second right he gets off of the
[49:00] first horse
[49:01] and gets on the second horseman now
[49:02] brother brown said that the
[49:04] horse just keeps on riding why because
[49:07] that white righteous church is still
[49:09] here today
[49:13] the red horse is still here today the
[49:15] black horse is still here today and
[49:17] obviously the writer is still here today
[49:20] but he has moved on up and become from a
[49:23] baby farm
[49:24] to where he doesn't want to be god i
[49:26] mean be like god he wants to be god
[49:27] right and you know who's going to make
[49:30] him god
[49:31] us with our denominational ideas are
[49:35] going to make him that's what's going to
[49:37] put
[49:38] come on people that's what's going to
[49:39] put that beast that's what's going to
[49:41] elevate him
[49:44] i'll promise you they'll say it's the
[49:47] lord
[49:48] the beast is not gonna be
[49:53] listen to me a true preacher
[49:57] he's not going to preach no eternal hell
[49:59] he's not going to preach
[50:01] and take care of take his father son
[50:03] holy ghost baptism out
[50:04] ah he's the epitome of false
[50:08] he's not going to change but the whole
[50:11] world
[50:12] listen i hate to say this but the whole
[50:16] world
[50:16] is already deceived by him
[50:21] already
[50:25] we're sitting here under that deception
[50:27] you look at all other denominations and
[50:28] you see that they're this close to that
[50:30] mother church remember the bible says
[50:34] there was a mother
[50:35] and she had daughters i'm still in the
[50:38] bible
[50:39] now what are daughters what are women
[50:40] churches amen
[50:42] you had the mother and then you
[50:44] had all of her daughters what that
[50:45] accepted the system that they're in all
[50:48] right
[50:51] i hate to say it but you know what
[50:52] that's what jesus stood up and said he
[50:53] said in other words
[50:55] whatever doctrine you're teaching
[50:58] because i'm going to read it here in a
[50:59] minute because
[50:59] they identified their self as children
[51:01] of abraham
[51:03] and they were by lineage
[51:08] we have moses
[51:11] as our father jesus said if you
[51:14] believe moses you believe me
[51:19] we have our underline whatever you want
[51:21] to underline baptist methodist
[51:22] pentecostal brandonism
[51:24] whatever you want to call it
[51:29] we have that
[51:32] jesus said um if you believe them
[51:36] you'd believe me right
[51:39] listen as we look
[51:42] here's my whole point as we look at
[51:44] jesus in the bible
[51:46] doing what he's supposed to do he was
[51:48] the word made flesh
[51:51] right he was everything the bible
[51:55] up to that point had said about him
[51:58] everything didn't miss it and they
[52:01] killed him
[52:03] for being who the bible said he was
[52:04] going to be
[52:08] well not me and you we may not
[52:09] physically die but we sure get it
[52:13] in other ways
[52:16] listen
[52:19] let's go to number four
[52:22] skip that one because we know the two
[52:24] spirits are going to go in their
[52:25] separate destinations
[52:26] the two vines will have to there will
[52:28] have to be a separating time between
[52:30] the wheat and the tares okay number four
[52:34] though
[52:34] all right let's go down to the bottom
[52:36] well now let's read it all i'm sorry now
[52:37] the church life is at the end the normal
[52:39] church the church now this is 1960
[52:41] before the seals open
[52:43] now this may stick just a little bit but
[52:45] the church carnal
[52:46] the esau church she's come to her in
[52:49] what's she doing heading up in the
[52:50] federation of churches which will
[52:52] finally join the romanism to fight
[52:53] catholicism and he stopped
[52:56] and it's catholicism to fight communism
[52:58] you got to remember when
[53:00] when brother branham was teaching in the
[53:01] 50s and the 60s
[53:03] man they just knew communism was the
[53:05] antichrist because communism this and
[53:06] communism
[53:07] he said don't worry about communism
[53:10] he said god raised up communism
[53:14] so the romanism could take over wow
[53:18] pope john is calling for all the
[53:19] churches to come back now that's 1960
[53:21] what about now
[53:23] and i'll tell you a little story in just
[53:24] a second bob you got to help me with
[53:26] this
[53:26] and they'll unite themselves together
[53:28] just exactly what thus saith the lord
[53:30] remember we watched that thing that
[53:31] willie had
[53:32] showed us at your house on the painted
[53:35] fire picture
[53:38] the pope today is standing up
[53:42] and what do they call it it's it's so
[53:45] close but remember he comes in with
[53:47] flattery
[53:49] he brings all the economies together and
[53:51] that's what his whole speech was
[53:53] and then they had i'm talking about when
[53:55] i say rothschild does that mean anything
[53:57] to anybody
[54:00] bill gates can't hold a bathroom
[54:04] compared to the rothschilds
[54:07] and all those different ones that are
[54:09] way above the bill gates you're talking
[54:10] about the bilderberg people
[54:12] they are all in with the pope and it's
[54:14] not called
[54:15] socialism now and that's exactly all
[54:17] democratic is of socialism
[54:19] and here we got democratic president we
[54:21] got democrat everybody so we got
[54:22] socialism don't worry about it
[54:25] but pope is standing up and saying
[54:28] what do you say bring them all together
[54:32] and then you've got the rothschild lady
[54:35] you've got a head of this company i'm
[54:37] talking about lightweight i ain't
[54:38] talking about bill gates bill gates to
[54:40] these people are chumps
[54:43] and he's worth 60 billion dollars right
[54:46] this is way up above that and they've
[54:48] got every one of them on a video
[54:50] and they're not calling it socialism but
[54:52] it's more of a form of capitalism that
[54:54] everybody shares everything
[54:57] well now that's socialism folks and i'm
[55:00] not into politics but i'm telling you
[55:02] it's romanism it's the pope taking over
[55:07] he stood right in the middle of that
[55:08] video and he told him he said oh this is
[55:11] the greatest thing and then all the
[55:12] other ones was like this is the greatest
[55:13] thing
[55:14] and you know what if you sat there and
[55:15] watched it
[55:18] and you poor man like me you look at him
[55:21] and go man that sounds pretty good
[55:24] they go give me some of their money not
[55:31] listen when you have a socialistic
[55:34] society
[55:35] people do get rich see in a socialistic
[55:38] society though it's supposed to be that
[55:40] if i make ten billion dollars and he
[55:42] makes two dollars i give him some of
[55:43] mine
[55:44] and we become equal ain't it happening
[55:47] ain't never happening ain't never gonna
[55:48] happen
[55:50] you've got you're rich and you got your
[55:52] poor
[55:53] and that's just the way it is but
[55:55] remember this is array
[55:57] got raised up catholicism to fight
[55:59] communism you know what they done
[56:01] what did they do the pope
[56:04] why i'm going this way i don't know the
[56:05] pope and ronald reagan gets together
[56:08] and busts up all the communism states
[56:10] right remember russia they
[56:12] they just broke them and it went back
[56:14] into yugoslavia poland and all the
[56:16] different ones it broke up into the
[56:17] different
[56:18] different states but remember the
[56:20] prophet of god said thus saith the lord
[56:22] you watch russia
[56:24] the bear's not dead the bear's still
[56:27] there
[56:29] but they're going to unite that video
[56:31] was so nice
[56:32] it was it had some really pretty music
[56:34] behind didn't it bro bob it was just
[56:36] like it was on a rock get asleep
[56:38] we're going to take this new form of
[56:41] capitalism to the world and you know
[56:42] what they want you to join
[56:44] right they look right at you and go you
[56:46] need to come and join this with us
[56:49] this is going to be the new wave and the
[56:50] pope's up there going
[56:52] this is the new wave you just wait and
[56:55] see
[56:57] folks we're heading to something but
[56:59] we're heading to something
[57:02] we are guaranteed we're not going to get
[57:04] caught up in that
[57:06] the true bride not the church the true
[57:08] bride will not get caught up in them
[57:10] number five the breach between the seven
[57:12] church ages but just think about those
[57:14] things i don't know
[57:15] maybe i'll get bob to pull it up for me
[57:16] and we'll or to find it brother william
[57:18] had it on his
[57:20] phone but it was just a real i mean it
[57:22] just like had butterflies and doves
[57:24] and birds and things chirping i mean it
[57:27] was just like
[57:28] you're like oh man this is great
[57:32] no it's bringing everything together
[57:35] under the head of one man
[57:37] the pope amen and all the other
[57:41] denominations are going to follow right
[57:43] behind them
[57:44] amen number five
[57:48] a seal signifies a finished work and
[57:50] when the seventh seal is broken now
[57:52] watch when the seven seal is broken they
[57:53] talk about breaking it
[57:54] on the breach everybody got that
[57:58] when the seventh hill is broken but now
[58:00] that's not the end of the seventh seal
[58:01] that's when it breaks
[58:03] the mystery of god that's sealed up in
[58:05] these mysterious seals is finished in
[58:07] other words it's got to go through and
[58:09] it will be finished
[58:11] until the day the seal is broken then
[58:13] it's revealed what's on the inside of it
[58:15] in other words
[58:17] remember what he said about the boxcar
[58:18] that's what we're looking at
[58:20] the boxcar remember is what you don't
[58:23] know what's behind
[58:24] it if a man's wondering what's in the
[58:26] boxcar you say it's supposed to be such
[58:28] and such it's supposed to be
[58:30] he's presuming man has been presuming
[58:33] for thousands of years
[58:36] but listen there's not presuming in god
[58:39] there's truth everything else is there
[58:44] but when the seal is broken the door is
[58:47] open
[58:48] now look the door is open
[58:52] everybody got that right but there's
[58:54] something in there
[58:56] right and it's got to be revealed
[58:59] right right man and that's only done at
[59:02] the end time right now
[59:04] well what's inside that box car
[59:07] the real bride the one that's gonna make
[59:09] it
[59:13] oh i hope this hits your heart listen
[59:18] you got something to do with this
[59:22] every bit of this is centered around you
[59:26] every bit of this bible this end time
[59:28] word that's
[59:29] come together is centered on me and you
[59:33] i was thinking god this morning of all
[59:35] the continents he let me go to and all
[59:37] the places and all the people
[59:38] he's allowed me to meet because of this
[59:40] message of the hour
[59:42] and to know that that is truth we're not
[59:45] going out searching for truth
[59:47] truth is here now look at number six now
[59:50] remember
[59:51] remember you got a box car you got
[59:53] product in the car
[59:55] you got a door that's sealed but the
[59:58] products in there
[1:00:00] but now it's like i said before but what
[1:00:02] if you
[1:00:03] what if you like pizza
[1:00:06] you like pizza or steak steak burn pizza
[1:00:10] huh steak okay my steak boy
[1:00:14] but now what if you knew you said what
[1:00:16] smells like steak
[1:00:18] i don't know what's in that box car but
[1:00:20] what if somebody comes by and opens it
[1:00:21] what if some man
[1:00:23] some prophet comes and opens the door
[1:00:27] and and and what's he going to do is he
[1:00:29] going to stand in the door and say now i
[1:00:31] know you like
[1:00:32] steak but you can't have none of that
[1:00:35] no a true man of god is going to say
[1:00:37] that thing's full
[1:00:39] have at it so that's what the seventh
[1:00:42] seal did when i believe the prophet when
[1:00:43] the seals opened here in the end time
[1:00:45] it was not to finish everything at that
[1:00:48] moment as far as moment of time
[1:00:50] right here but it was going towards
[1:00:53] something
[1:00:54] because i want to eat what's in that box
[1:00:56] car i like steak too
[1:00:59] amen to watch what he says oh look we
[1:01:02] must remember that this seventh seal
[1:01:03] book is the end of
[1:01:05] time of all things that's right the
[1:01:07] things written in the seven seal book
[1:01:09] sealed up of the plan of redemption see
[1:01:12] nobody's ever been able to get the plan
[1:01:14] of redemption right
[1:01:15] until now the water baptism and the way
[1:01:18] to get justified the way to get
[1:01:20] sanctified
[1:01:21] the baptists have a real good once saved
[1:01:23] always saved
[1:01:26] justification because god will forgive
[1:01:29] you of your past sins
[1:01:31] but you got to keep going
[1:01:34] not shake somebody's hand and five years
[1:01:37] later come back to church
[1:01:39] and keep doing what you're doing no the
[1:01:42] bible says the unclean spirit goes out
[1:01:44] right in sanctification
[1:01:48] and then the baptism of holy ghost it's
[1:01:51] not just a feeling or a sensation or a
[1:01:53] shaking of hand or
[1:01:54] or this it's god almighty coming in and
[1:01:58] changing you burning out the old you
[1:02:03] that's this bit the book that sealed up
[1:02:05] to the plan of redemption from before
[1:02:07] the foundation of the world
[1:02:09] it ever been ends it is the end is the
[1:02:10] end of the struggling world the end of
[1:02:12] the struggling nature
[1:02:13] the end of everything now look watch
[1:02:16] this
[1:02:16] this is where i got it in there is the
[1:02:18] end of the trumpets now when does the
[1:02:20] trumpet ends the trumpets don't end
[1:02:21] while we're here
[1:02:24] the feast of the trumpets to israel ends
[1:02:27] when the
[1:02:28] way over 144 000.
[1:02:31] you see this journey but the seal had to
[1:02:33] open here to a bride
[1:02:36] for us to be able to preach it as
[1:02:38] brother dale's preaching it for the body
[1:02:40] change and the different things we had
[1:02:42] to have that boxcar
[1:02:43] open and partake of what's in the boxcar
[1:02:48] then it shows us listen we got a clear
[1:02:51] path
[1:02:51] all the way to where we're going to live
[1:02:53] eternally
[1:02:54] in a home
[1:03:01] without any question
[1:03:05] i don't have to go ask father so-and-so
[1:03:07] what's going on because father so-and-so
[1:03:08] may tell you something else besides what
[1:03:10] other father so-and-so said
[1:03:12] amen but now remember
[1:03:16] as we want to get to in a minute they
[1:03:19] come to jesus and ask him questions and
[1:03:21] they did not believe what he said
[1:03:23] because he didn't tell them the normal
[1:03:25] of their doctrine
[1:03:27] amen that's why we're not very normal
[1:03:32] because we have to be like jesus christ
[1:03:35] was
[1:03:36] we have to be where the whole world
[1:03:39] you know what the sinners didn't hate
[1:03:40] jesus
[1:03:42] the prostitutes didn't hate jesus some
[1:03:44] of the republicans they didn't hate
[1:03:46] jesus
[1:03:47] who hated him the religious world hated
[1:03:49] him
[1:03:50] that antichrist spirit that was in those
[1:03:52] people
[1:03:53] hated jesus christ
[1:03:57] and so it will in the end time
[1:04:01] it is the end the end of the struggling
[1:04:02] world it's the end of the struggle of
[1:04:03] nature it's the end of everything
[1:04:05] and there's the end of the trumpets the
[1:04:07] end of the vials now remember the vials
[1:04:09] get poured out after we're gone
[1:04:11] it's the end of the earth the earth gets
[1:04:13] after we're gone it's even the end of
[1:04:15] time
[1:04:16] time runs out bible says now look the
[1:04:18] time runs out
[1:04:19] literal time on earth doesn't run out
[1:04:21] until the future home starts
[1:04:24] because during the millennium you still
[1:04:25] have time right but now watch what he
[1:04:27] says
[1:04:29] the bible said so matthew 7 i remain in
[1:04:31] revelations 10
[1:04:33] 1-7 time runs out the angel says time
[1:04:35] will be no longer
[1:04:36] the day is this great thing to happen
[1:04:38] now watch everything runs out in this
[1:04:39] time the end of
[1:04:41] at the end of this seventh seal
[1:04:46] now it's open
[1:04:49] here today if you believe it
[1:04:54] but the culmination of it is not going
[1:04:56] to be over here until we walk into the
[1:04:57] future home
[1:04:59] all right same way with jesus christ now
[1:05:02] remember when he was born he was born a
[1:05:04] baby
[1:05:06] he was still born emmanuel god with us
[1:05:09] he didn't change into god in his journey
[1:05:13] and what was he he was the seventh seal
[1:05:16] but he had to come to an end
[1:05:20] so that you and i could come to the
[1:05:22] beginning
[1:05:24] he had to die he had the ascent or he
[1:05:27] had to come back he had to take on a
[1:05:29] glorified body he had to ascend and he
[1:05:32] had to come back
[1:05:33] so that he could further that seventh
[1:05:35] seal ending in me and you
[1:05:37] down here in the bride now i'm talking
[1:05:39] about the bride ain't talking about the
[1:05:40] 144 thousand i ain't talking about the
[1:05:42] church
[1:05:43] i'm done with the bride the bride has an
[1:05:47] ending of a seventh seal it's when we
[1:05:49] take a body change because it's when
[1:05:50] jesus christ
[1:05:51] has revealed himself just like he was
[1:05:53] back then what brother dale's been
[1:05:55] talking about amen
[1:05:56] at the end of this seventh seal now
[1:05:58] watch notice it's the end of the church
[1:05:59] age
[1:06:00] it's the end of the seven seals at the
[1:06:02] end of the trumpets the end of the biles
[1:06:04] ends the ushering in of the millennium
[1:06:06] that's on that seventh seal
[1:06:07] it's like firing a rocket all right
[1:06:09] we'll reap to skip time
[1:06:11] go to revelations 10 7. but in the days
[1:06:13] of the voice
[1:06:15] there's got to be six angels got to be
[1:06:17] seven angels sound
[1:06:19] when this seventh angel sounds all right
[1:06:23] revelations 10 7 but in the days of the
[1:06:25] voice of the seventh angel
[1:06:27] an angel is what a messenger when he
[1:06:29] shall begin to sound the mystery one
[1:06:32] mystery of god
[1:06:33] should be finished as he hath declared
[1:06:35] to his servants
[1:06:37] the prophets and what have i told you
[1:06:38] that mystery was paul told you what that
[1:06:39] mystery was
[1:06:41] the great mystery of the gentiles is
[1:06:43] christ in you the hope of glory
[1:06:45] and if christ is in you are you gonna
[1:06:46] have three or four different
[1:06:48] ideas i don't think so
[1:06:54] but how we come to jesus had to come to
[1:06:56] an end
[1:06:59] his life on earth came to an end
[1:07:03] on easter or on a good friday
[1:07:06] jesus died right
[1:07:10] he died a physical death he died
[1:07:14] went to the grave his body was dead and
[1:07:16] cold
[1:07:18] but he resurrected because he said he
[1:07:20] was going to resurrect
[1:07:21] and he resurrected because the old
[1:07:23] testament said he was going to resurrect
[1:07:25] i'll leave not leave my soul in hell or
[1:07:27] leave my holy one to see corruption
[1:07:29] so within the three days he came back up
[1:07:31] and what did he do though
[1:07:33] being god almighty and human flesh
[1:07:36] though
[1:07:37] now when he was on earth he didn't save
[1:07:39] one person
[1:07:41] yeah oh he told the prostitute go on and
[1:07:44] sin no more
[1:07:45] um you know you understand what i'm
[1:07:46] saying but there was no birth of a
[1:07:48] of a family member
[1:07:51] until the day of pentecost so on the day
[1:07:54] of pentecost that started
[1:07:57] to me that see that started that seventh
[1:08:00] seal
[1:08:01] it opened on the day of pentecost
[1:08:05] because that was christ he is those
[1:08:08] seals
[1:08:08] he is those what the very redemption
[1:08:11] plan he came to
[1:08:12] to to to give us started on the day of
[1:08:15] pentecost
[1:08:16] no other now sure there's pieces in
[1:08:18] there you understand what i mean they'll
[1:08:19] be given eternal life
[1:08:20] i'm talking about the genesis 1 26 the
[1:08:23] bride people the people that were inside
[1:08:25] of him
[1:08:26] when he was on the cross came out
[1:08:30] the seal brother brown says the seal of
[1:08:33] death was broke
[1:08:34] glory to what to show not just jesus
[1:08:37] christ he's to show you
[1:08:40] oh i got to go away but i'm coming back
[1:08:43] i'm not coming back to confuse you
[1:08:45] though
[1:08:47] that was the antichrist he comes to
[1:08:50] confuse
[1:08:51] christ does not come to confuse
[1:08:55] but listen to this real quick then we'll
[1:08:57] close
[1:09:01] number seven let's read it
[1:09:04] i mentioned that it takes the holy
[1:09:05] spirit to give us revelation or we will
[1:09:07] fail to get it
[1:09:08] bringing these two thoughts together you
[1:09:10] will see that it won't take just
[1:09:11] ordinary study
[1:09:12] and thinking to make this bible real let
[1:09:15] me ask you a question how many of you
[1:09:18] read the bible before you came in the
[1:09:20] message
[1:09:22] raise your hands about 70
[1:09:25] of the people
[1:09:29] you read a little different though
[1:09:30] didn't you
[1:09:32] did you not when you read these
[1:09:35] mysteries or these things that are not
[1:09:37] mystery anymore like brother tatum used
[1:09:41] to say oh brother tell him bless his
[1:09:42] heart
[1:09:43] i miss him we'll see he said he'd read
[1:09:46] he you know i guess he was pentecostal
[1:09:48] battle he's probably baptist
[1:09:50] he'd read he said i'd turn that bible
[1:09:52] and i'd read matthew 28
[1:09:53] 19. jesus said go into all the world
[1:09:57] preach the gospel baptize in the name of
[1:09:58] the father
[1:09:59] name of the son or the name of the
[1:10:00] father and of the son of the holy ghost
[1:10:02] he said but when i got over there to
[1:10:03] acts 2 38 he said i did this
[1:10:08] why he didn't want to read what was
[1:10:09] written already in the word of god it
[1:10:11] was contrary to what
[1:10:12] what to what somebody had told him right
[1:10:16] now what the bible says but contrary to
[1:10:19] what somebody had told him
[1:10:22] and you know what it does every once in
[1:10:23] a while how many times have you when you
[1:10:24] come into the mess of the hour and you
[1:10:25] hear the certain things
[1:10:27] and there's still that little gnawing
[1:10:29] inside goes
[1:10:30] i don't know if that's right or not
[1:10:33] man i've been talk since i was a baby
[1:10:36] how to be baptized i've been taught
[1:10:39] since i was a baby
[1:10:42] that these things were whatever like i
[1:10:44] said before you know mom was walking on
[1:10:45] the streets to go with the lord no he's
[1:10:47] no she's not
[1:10:49] that's that's not bible that's that's
[1:10:52] somebody told you that right
[1:10:55] your mom ain't walking on the streets to
[1:10:57] go with jesus right now that's in the
[1:10:58] that's over in the future home way long
[1:11:00] time from here
[1:11:02] they're in another dimension and they're
[1:11:04] waiting
[1:11:06] to see jesus but they're not with him
[1:11:08] right now
[1:11:10] but we see that if you but then what do
[1:11:12] you do what do you do now though
[1:11:14] you read the bible just like hattie
[1:11:17] wright said and when you read it you
[1:11:18] said that ain't nothing but the truth
[1:11:20] it can't be all other way
[1:11:23] it can't be but so let's let's take this
[1:11:25] situation let's go to john 6 verse 53.
[1:11:30] now we've seen some strange things
[1:11:32] listen uh look at me don't look at that
[1:11:34] turn that off thank you
[1:11:38] i like it when they do what i think
[1:11:41] we come to situations though where we
[1:11:43] did come to the message of the hour to
[1:11:45] the truth or whatever you want to call
[1:11:46] i say the message of the hour everybody
[1:11:48] has a message there is a message but
[1:11:50] listen
[1:11:50] there's not 16 different one message of
[1:11:53] the hour
[1:11:54] there's only one message for each church
[1:11:56] age for each hour and we
[1:11:58] are under number seven right but when we
[1:12:01] start talking about these things
[1:12:05] it becomes strange like i read you in
[1:12:07] first john
[1:12:08] the world heareth what the world wants
[1:12:10] to hear
[1:12:14] but we hear what we hear
[1:12:17] right all right so now
[1:12:20] let me set the stage here's the most
[1:12:23] come here
[1:12:24] you still in the front room will usually
[1:12:26] anyway come on
[1:12:29] sorry this is kaifus
[1:12:34] you think i was going to be that
[1:12:38] okay this is that no this is jesus i'm
[1:12:41] kaifus
[1:12:42] now look i'm the high priest right
[1:12:45] everybody say uh-huh uh-huh i'm the high
[1:12:49] priest
[1:12:50] i am the most religious person
[1:12:53] on the face of the earth
[1:12:58] at the moment according to the world
[1:13:02] according to the torah according to
[1:13:04] isaiah
[1:13:05] according to amen
[1:13:08] i have not one spot
[1:13:12] against my lineage
[1:13:16] i don't eat cheese and all that other
[1:13:18] stuff together with something i don't
[1:13:20] eat
[1:13:20] uh dead animals you understand what i
[1:13:22] mean
[1:13:23] i don't eat pork i don't eat anything
[1:13:25] whatever the bible tells me to do at the
[1:13:27] moment
[1:13:28] i don't do it because i cannot be the
[1:13:31] high priest without that happening so
[1:13:32] guess what
[1:13:33] i'm the headstone
[1:13:37] of that message of that hour oh yeah
[1:13:39] right
[1:13:40] none higher i'm caiaphas and i got all
[1:13:44] my caffs and little conferences around
[1:13:46] me
[1:13:48] right and they're the same way
[1:13:53] they're the same way they read the torah
[1:13:55] every day
[1:13:57] they read the prophets every day
[1:14:00] right so here walks this man up
[1:14:04] just a common guy he don't have one like
[1:14:06] good robes and
[1:14:07] he's probably a little you know he's
[1:14:09] been out in the desert and
[1:14:10] you know he's hair's all messed up
[1:14:14] but he comes walking in and he starts
[1:14:16] saying things
[1:14:18] strange to what i live by
[1:14:22] that sound familiar strange to what i
[1:14:25] live
[1:14:26] he says strange things
[1:14:29] strange man what but yet this man
[1:14:34] is the word of god
[1:14:37] there's not a piece of him that's not
[1:14:39] the word of god he
[1:14:40] came the way the word said he was the
[1:14:44] word made flesh
[1:14:45] he was the one listen folks let me get
[1:14:48] let's see this man this is jesus
[1:14:50] he wrote what they're trying to live
[1:14:53] right you say oh no he's the second
[1:14:55] person no forget it
[1:14:57] they went but one god listen they even
[1:15:00] said that jesus they said you are the
[1:15:02] creator in other words this guy that was
[1:15:04] standing here not the flesh
[1:15:05] but this guy that was inside him they
[1:15:07] realized that was christ
[1:15:10] that all the way at the beginning of the
[1:15:12] of the
[1:15:13] world he was the creator but now caiphus
[1:15:16] didn't
[1:15:17] caiphus just thought he was some common
[1:15:19] ordinary guy and
[1:15:20] you know he says things different than
[1:15:23] what i say but now
[1:15:24] i'm the religion of the day
[1:15:28] i'm the guy you gotta listen to isn't
[1:15:30] that true
[1:15:31] and you know what they did they depended
[1:15:33] on caiaphas to put on the right robe
[1:15:36] they depended on confidence to wash the
[1:15:38] right animal they depended on compass to
[1:15:40] kill the right animal
[1:15:42] they depended on confidence to take that
[1:15:44] one vial of blood and go into the holy
[1:15:47] of holies which that's
[1:15:50] holy of holies is standing right there
[1:15:54] sprinkle the blood and atone for
[1:15:57] all of israel's sin and they depended on
[1:15:59] that man to do that
[1:16:02] am i strong enough and he walked out
[1:16:07] and he was the high priest couldn't
[1:16:09] touch him
[1:16:12] couldn't touch him yet here walks up
[1:16:15] a guy
[1:16:18] starts talking and he fulfills
[1:16:22] everything that they're saying over here
[1:16:26] everything he's the whole word remember
[1:16:29] he's not just part of it
[1:16:31] isaiah was part of it now this man is
[1:16:33] all of it
[1:16:34] right but yet what does catholics do
[1:16:36] when he walks up
[1:16:38] you're of a devil you're not just
[1:16:42] a part of a devil you got ev you're the
[1:16:45] head man you're
[1:16:46] like i'm the head priest you're the like
[1:16:49] i'm the headstone you're the headstone
[1:16:51] of demons
[1:16:52] now how can that be
[1:16:55] how can that be
[1:17:02] john 6 verse 53 then jesus said unto
[1:17:06] them who's them
[1:17:09] verily verily i say unto you except you
[1:17:12] eat the flesh
[1:17:13] oh my goodness
[1:17:16] of the son of man and drink his blood
[1:17:24] you have no life in you now wait a
[1:17:27] minute
[1:17:28] the man of the hour standing here
[1:17:31] he said i ain't got to do any of that
[1:17:35] but this man over here saying unless you
[1:17:37] eat my flesh
[1:17:38] and drink my blood you have no life in
[1:17:42] you
[1:17:42] you know what he was saying confidence
[1:17:45] whatever you're doing
[1:17:46] is lifeless he said you have made your
[1:17:51] traditions
[1:17:53] in other words a stink in the nostril of
[1:17:55] god whoso eateth my flesh
[1:17:58] and drinking my blood he didn't just
[1:17:59] make a quote he's preaching here
[1:18:01] whosoever is my flesh and drink is my
[1:18:03] blood hath what
[1:18:05] eternal life how can that happen kaifa
[1:18:09] says
[1:18:10] and i will raise him up look at the
[1:18:12] power this man said he had if you got
[1:18:13] eternal life i'll raise you up
[1:18:17] for my flesh is meat and deed and my
[1:18:19] blood is drinking indeed
[1:18:20] he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my
[1:18:22] blood dwelleth in me
[1:18:24] and i in him now how strange of a
[1:18:26] doctrine is that
[1:18:28] sounds real weird doesn't it kind of
[1:18:30] like when you first came in a message
[1:18:32] and weird doctrine sounded a little
[1:18:33] weird didn't they
[1:18:38] amen
[1:18:40] as the living father hath sent me and
[1:18:43] i live by the father so he that eateth
[1:18:46] me
[1:18:46] even he shall live by me this is that
[1:18:50] bread
[1:18:50] now listen he's taking them all the way
[1:18:53] back
[1:18:55] to the children of israel and he's
[1:18:58] telling them
[1:19:00] who he was or who he is as the living
[1:19:03] father has sent me i live by the father
[1:19:05] so he that eateth me even he shall live
[1:19:06] by me
[1:19:08] this is that bread which came down from
[1:19:11] heaven
[1:19:11] and i'm sure catholics and him are going
[1:19:13] wait a minute that was a loaf of bread
[1:19:14] and it comes floating down and how in
[1:19:16] the world is it
[1:19:17] you well guess what he's the one who
[1:19:19] created it right that's why you can say
[1:19:22] this listen
[1:19:24] this man didn't have a bunch of history
[1:19:25] books to listen to or what or read
[1:19:28] jesus was the history book he was back
[1:19:30] in history
[1:19:33] that's what i'm saying listen let that
[1:19:36] thing out that's inside of you
[1:19:39] if you have the baptism of the holy
[1:19:41] ghost you were standing there when god
[1:19:43] said let there be light
[1:19:47] are you all okay i know you're about
[1:19:49] half asleep but this ought to excite you
[1:19:51] pretty much because you know what if you
[1:19:52] were back there
[1:19:53] you're going to be in the future home
[1:19:57] this is that bread which came down from
[1:19:59] heaven not as your fathers did eat manna
[1:20:02] and are dead
[1:20:04] and if you'll look up that word dead
[1:20:05] remember what brother mom said that was
[1:20:07] eternally
[1:20:07] separated from god he that eateth of
[1:20:11] this bread
[1:20:12] shall live forever forever now look
[1:20:14] these things he said is he in the
[1:20:16] synagogue
[1:20:17] as he taught in capernaum now look jesus
[1:20:19] told him one day he said look this thing
[1:20:21] wasn't done in the corner
[1:20:23] i've been standing in this temple with
[1:20:26] you
[1:20:27] trying to get you to see who i am many
[1:20:30] therefore of his disciples when
[1:20:32] they heard this said this is a hard
[1:20:34] saying
[1:20:35] who can hear it when jesus knew it
[1:20:38] himself that his disciples murmured at
[1:20:41] it
[1:20:41] he said does this offend you
[1:20:46] sisters brothers does it offend you for
[1:20:48] somebody to preach and step on your toes
[1:20:49] every once in a while
[1:20:53] what if you shall see the son of man
[1:20:55] ascend up to where he was before now
[1:20:57] wait a minute hold on
[1:21:00] who are you saying you are
[1:21:04] i'm standing here yet i'm ascended yet
[1:21:06] i've come back
[1:21:07] see how confusing that that would be to
[1:21:09] a normal person though
[1:21:13] it is the spirit that quickeneth the
[1:21:15] flesh prophet is nothing
[1:21:18] the words that i speak unto you
[1:21:21] they are spirit and their life why
[1:21:23] didn't just everybody why
[1:21:24] confidence just say all right if you're
[1:21:27] it
[1:21:27] i'm here because you know why it was
[1:21:30] them two spirits fighting each other
[1:21:32] that's right
[1:21:33] there was two spirits in there fighting
[1:21:34] each other just like the same way they
[1:21:36] fight now
[1:21:39] it is the spirit the question that the
[1:21:40] fast profit is nothing the word that i
[1:21:42] speak of to you they are what
[1:21:43] spirit and life but there are some of
[1:21:46] you that believe
[1:21:47] not for jesus knew from the beginning
[1:21:50] who were they
[1:21:50] that believe not and who should betray
[1:21:52] him and he said therefore i said unto
[1:21:54] you
[1:21:54] that no man can come unto me except that
[1:21:57] we're giving unto him or my father
[1:21:59] from that time this is
[1:22:02] y'all know this is john 6 verse 66 right
[1:22:06] 666 the number of man oh john 6 66 says
[1:22:10] from that time many of his disciples
[1:22:12] what
[1:22:13] went back and walked no more with him
[1:22:16] couldn't take it couldn't take this new
[1:22:17] revelation couldn't take this new
[1:22:19] doctrine
[1:22:20] then jesus said unto the twelve will you
[1:22:22] go away will you also go away then simon
[1:22:25] peter answers it lord
[1:22:26] to whom shall we go thou hast the words
[1:22:31] of eternal life amen that's what you
[1:22:33] guys decide today who's got the words of
[1:22:36] eternal life it's not wade dale samuel
[1:22:37] now
[1:22:38] it's the living word of god in all of us
[1:22:42] let's go to john 8 it gets worse
[1:22:47] john 8 39 look they answered and said
[1:22:50] unto him
[1:22:50] now who is they if you'll read it before
[1:22:52] it subscribes in the
[1:22:54] in the pharisees and the sadducees and i
[1:22:56] don't know if catholics was here at the
[1:22:57] time but it's kind of the
[1:22:59] hi guys they answered and said unto him
[1:23:02] i'm sure they took their little thanks
[1:23:04] abraham's our father
[1:23:07] jesus said if you were abraham's
[1:23:10] children in other words if you can read
[1:23:11] the bible like i'm reading the bible
[1:23:13] you'll know who i am
[1:23:15] if you were abraham's children you would
[1:23:16] do the works of abraham
[1:23:19] but now you seek to kill me a man that
[1:23:23] hath told you
[1:23:24] the truth
[1:23:29] which i have heard of god
[1:23:33] this did not abraham in other words
[1:23:35] abraham didn't go around trying to kill
[1:23:36] everybody that told him what
[1:23:38] was going on you do the deeds of your
[1:23:41] father
[1:23:43] then they said unto him we be not born
[1:23:45] of fornication in other words we knew
[1:23:47] we know where you came from you and that
[1:23:49] your mama you she didn't have no debt
[1:23:51] you had no daddy
[1:23:52] we have one father even god jesus said
[1:23:54] unto them if god were your father
[1:23:56] you'd love me wow if god were your
[1:24:00] father you'd love me
[1:24:03] look folks this is what we're talking
[1:24:04] about now the two spirits are talking to
[1:24:06] each other
[1:24:09] for i proceeded forth and came from god
[1:24:11] neither came i
[1:24:12] of myself but he sent me
[1:24:16] why did you not understand my speech
[1:24:21] even because you cannot hear my word you
[1:24:23] can hear my what up
[1:24:24] you can hear my you can hear my verbiage
[1:24:27] you can hear the
[1:24:28] you know the the the sound you know the
[1:24:30] wave sound waves were in their ear
[1:24:32] but he said you're not listening to what
[1:24:34] i said because watch what he says
[1:24:37] ye of your father wow
[1:24:41] don't ever tell me that
[1:24:45] ye of your father the devil and the lust
[1:24:48] of your father you will do
[1:24:50] he was a murderer he took him all the
[1:24:52] way back to cain
[1:24:54] he took him all the way back to genesis
[1:24:56] chapter 4.
[1:25:00] it said he was a murderer from the
[1:25:02] beginning and abode
[1:25:03] not in the truth because there is no
[1:25:06] truth in him when he speaketh the lie
[1:25:08] he speaketh of his own for he is a liar
[1:25:10] and the father of it
[1:25:12] and because i tell you the truth in
[1:25:14] other words you're doing the same thing
[1:25:17] you believe me not which of you
[1:25:19] convinces me of sin
[1:25:21] and if you say the truth why do you not
[1:25:23] believe me if i say the truth
[1:25:25] why do you not believe me he that is
[1:25:28] of god heareth god's word
[1:25:31] ye therefore hear them not because you
[1:25:35] are not of god boy that seal broke right
[1:25:38] there
[1:25:40] opened that thing up and he was telling
[1:25:42] them who he was but what did they do
[1:25:44] they rejected him
[1:25:45] they put him on a tree they killed him
[1:25:48] let's read this right here
[1:25:50] and then we'll close musicians get ready
[1:25:51] matthew 24 verse 7 for nations shall
[1:25:53] rise against nation and kingdom against
[1:25:55] kingdom
[1:25:56] there shall be famines pestilence
[1:25:57] earthquakes and many places now this is
[1:25:59] the end time
[1:26:01] all these are the beginning of sorrows
[1:26:02] now this is on this is jesus preaching
[1:26:04] the seals but watch
[1:26:05] then shall they deliver you up to be
[1:26:07] afflicted and shall kill you
[1:26:09] and you shall be hated of all nations
[1:26:12] for
[1:26:13] my name's sake
[1:26:16] and then shall many be offended and
[1:26:18] shall betray one another and shall hate
[1:26:20] one another luke 21 verse 15 for i will
[1:26:23] give you a mouth and wisdom
[1:26:26] which all of your adversaries shall not
[1:26:28] be able to gain satan or resist
[1:26:31] thank you lord for this promise and you
[1:26:33] shall be betrayed both by parents and
[1:26:36] brethren and kinfolk and friends and
[1:26:38] some of you shall be caused put to death
[1:26:41] and you shall be hated of all men wait a
[1:26:43] minute
[1:26:44] for my name's sake
[1:26:48] he said that before for my name's sake
[1:26:52] but there shall not a hair of your head
[1:26:56] perish john 16 verse 1. listen to this
[1:27:00] these things have i spoken unto you that
[1:27:02] you should not be offended
[1:27:04] they shall put you out of the synagogues
[1:27:06] yea the time cometh that whosoever
[1:27:08] killeth you
[1:27:09] will think that he doeth god service
[1:27:13] when caiaphas put jesus on the cross he
[1:27:15] thought he was doing exactly what his
[1:27:18] his look at me his father was telling
[1:27:21] him to do
[1:27:23] and these things will they do unto you
[1:27:25] because they have not
[1:27:26] known the father nor me right not trying
[1:27:32] to scare you
[1:27:33] folks but i'm telling you the separation
[1:27:35] time is not going to be pretty
[1:27:37] it wasn't pretty back then and it's not
[1:27:39] going to be pretty now
[1:27:41] it's going to be and listen
[1:27:44] it ain't us against them
[1:27:47] it's the two spirits it's god fighting
[1:27:51] the battle
[1:27:51] and satan fighting the battle it's
[1:27:53] michael is still fighting for you
[1:27:55] and satan is still fighting against you
[1:27:58] now remember
[1:28:01] how does the battle get won
[1:28:05] whoever you yield to and get two to one
[1:28:08] on each side
[1:28:09] either side two to one on either side
[1:28:11] it's your decision to make whether you
[1:28:14] want to seek the truth
[1:28:16] or live under a truth there are people
[1:28:18] that have a truth
[1:28:19] right but there's not anybody that has
[1:28:21] the truth except the ones that can take
[1:28:24] this word of god
[1:28:25] and word by word put it together
[1:28:30] because satan can't do that and he hates
[1:28:32] it
[1:28:34] that's why he loves the denominational
[1:28:35] world because they've got it all
[1:28:36] different
[1:28:37] in different ways different they add
[1:28:39] this they take out that they add this
[1:28:40] they make a you bible they're making you
[1:28:43] know venia they're making you apostles
[1:28:45] creed they say this you've got to say
[1:28:46] this and you've got to do the little
[1:28:48] sign of the cross and all those things
[1:28:49] god's not in none of that god's in his
[1:28:52] word
[1:28:54] and just like i showed you the
[1:28:55] difference between the two there is a
[1:28:56] physical
[1:28:57] there's a spirit but now that spirit
[1:28:59] anoints physical people you got to
[1:29:00] remember it doesn't just float out in
[1:29:02] the air
[1:29:02] right it anoints physical people right
[1:29:06] satan was anointing catholics just like
[1:29:08] he anointed that beast in the end time i
[1:29:10] mean in the beginning
[1:29:12] and just like he'll anoint that beast in
[1:29:13] the end time
[1:29:15] just as a beginning he was speaking
[1:29:16] through catholics because look
[1:29:18] caiphus couldn't say couldn't look at
[1:29:20] the word of god and the word of god be
[1:29:21] in
[1:29:22] him and he'd look and say your bell's
[1:29:24] your bob
[1:29:25] that can't happen because jesus even
[1:29:27] said look he said how can satan cast out
[1:29:29] satan
[1:29:31] you see me cast these evil spirits out
[1:29:33] how can satan cast
[1:29:34] out satan unless his house be divided
[1:29:38] you know what that didn't bother them
[1:29:39] one bit they just kept right on going
[1:29:43] it's whoever was preaching somebody was
[1:29:45] preaching the the uh william
[1:29:47] the veil was rent from top to bottom and
[1:29:49] that thing's what's
[1:29:50] 60 feet tall than anything they had to
[1:29:53] know that was god that did that
[1:29:56] a man didn't crawl up there and cut the
[1:29:57] thing from top to bottom now see if it
[1:29:59] would have been rent from bottom to top
[1:30:00] they could have said somebody cut it and
[1:30:02] ripped it but it was rent from top to
[1:30:04] bottom
[1:30:05] god rent that thing god pulled it apart
[1:30:08] he said i'm done with this i'm not
[1:30:11] hitting anymore
[1:30:13] when i come back in three days
[1:30:18] i'll not be hit again i'm going to be
[1:30:21] what but i'm going to be inside of a
[1:30:23] group of people
[1:30:24] right and they're going to believe what
[1:30:26] i said
[1:30:27] they're going to be my children they're
[1:30:29] going to be led by the spirit of god
[1:30:31] they're going to be led to truth
[1:30:32] musicians come they're going to be led
[1:30:34] to the truth everybody that's born of
[1:30:37] god will be led to the truth
[1:30:49] no need to concern ourselves with world
[1:30:51] affairs
[1:30:55] but now remember like i said before that
[1:30:57] jesus didn't go crawl up in a cave and
[1:31:01] and stay there for 30 something years no
[1:31:03] he lived his life
[1:31:05] he worked in his daddy's carpenter shop
[1:31:07] he probably got splinters in his hand
[1:31:09] and he probably can make a real nice
[1:31:10] piece of furniture you understand what
[1:31:12] i'm saying
[1:31:13] but when his job come he didn't shy away
[1:31:15] at either he went straight into the
[1:31:17] synagogue
[1:31:18] he didn't he said i didn't do this in a
[1:31:20] corner i didn't do this in the shadow
[1:31:22] somewhere
[1:31:23] i did it right out here in plainview
[1:31:27] same way when the prophet of god come at
[1:31:29] the end time he said i didn't hide i
[1:31:30] came to every one of you denominations
[1:31:32] and you turned me down
[1:31:33] just like right just like your daddy
[1:31:37] denomination
[1:31:39] turned me down in the beginning because
[1:31:41] if that listen
[1:31:42] if christ is in you the hope of glory
[1:31:45] it's the same thing's going to happen
[1:31:49] right so so you say well the end of the
[1:31:52] seventh seal is just like
[1:31:53] there it is no if you'll remember the
[1:31:55] analogy brother brown said
[1:31:57] anybody ever shot oh wait a minute we're
[1:31:58] in jordan
[1:32:01] when we used to watch people shoot roman
[1:32:03] candles in another state
[1:32:07] because it was illegal in the state of
[1:32:08] georgia for a while but remember what a
[1:32:10] roman candle does though it's got
[1:32:12] like eight balls in it you fight you hit
[1:32:14] the you hit the
[1:32:15] uh ignition and they go up well what do
[1:32:18] those balls do
[1:32:19] they burst then they burst and then they
[1:32:21] keep bursting and if you if it was an
[1:32:23] eternal burst it would just be
[1:32:25] it started from one ball but it just
[1:32:26] kept bursting and bursting but that's
[1:32:27] what god did on the day of pentecost
[1:32:31] but that's what brother bradley was
[1:32:32] talking about the seventh seal he said
[1:32:34] it's like a rocket going off what is it
[1:32:36] it's a journey tomorrow you're gonna
[1:32:39] have a
[1:32:40] pop the next day you're gonna have a
[1:32:42] pipe
[1:32:43] revelation the next day you're gonna go
[1:32:46] thank you god
[1:32:47] thank you god thank you god for oh
[1:32:51] brother john you ought to know that
[1:32:54] whole company you work for
[1:32:57] it's working for you
[1:33:06] well did they move it 15 miles away
[1:33:09] they you moved it what 15 miles close
[1:33:13] to exactly where you live and they
[1:33:15] didn't ask you where you live did they
[1:33:17] they did
[1:33:18] you know what it was it was god god
[1:33:21] swooped down and said hey
[1:33:23] move that thing 15 miles closer
[1:33:28] and they didn't really say that you know
[1:33:29] what it was just an unction
[1:33:31] but then john walks in one day and he's
[1:33:33] got that big old smile on his face
[1:33:35] he's going man y'all know what y'all
[1:33:38] just did
[1:33:39] they said no you moved 15 miles closer
[1:33:42] to my work
[1:33:43] and you know what they probably just
[1:33:44] said oh well okay no that was god did
[1:33:47] that
[1:33:48] everything you got in your life let's
[1:33:49] stand our feet everything you do
[1:33:51] how many of you can testify all day long
[1:33:53] the things that god's done for you
[1:33:55] that it's not being controlled by the
[1:33:58] world
[1:34:01] amen because you know what you won't
[1:34:02] know how many other buildings they may
[1:34:05] have tried to choose
[1:34:08] how many times you tried to do something
[1:34:10] and you think oh man that door just shut
[1:34:14] but if you're a child of god you know
[1:34:16] who shut that door god shut the door
[1:34:19] because god got you 15 miles closer over
[1:34:21] here god didn't want them to go over
[1:34:23] here in this warehouse it was 30 miles
[1:34:24] away he wanted to go in this warehouse
[1:34:26] over here and you know what
[1:34:28] the warehouse was empty was it owned by
[1:34:32] the company
[1:34:34] yeah i'm not sure see there it may have
[1:34:37] just
[1:34:37] they may have just said well we own this
[1:34:39] building over here but i think we're
[1:34:40] going to buy that one why are we buying
[1:34:41] that one i don't know you told us to buy
[1:34:43] it so we bought it
[1:34:45] and god's going i told you to do it
[1:34:48] for my bride he takes care of his
[1:34:52] children
[1:34:54] he's not obligated to take care of
[1:34:56] nobody else
[1:34:57] but his own children now god's a good
[1:35:00] god he's a merciful god he's a gracious
[1:35:01] god but we don't believe in greasy grace
[1:35:03] either
[1:35:04] god's not going to just let you get by
[1:35:05] with anything in the world
[1:35:07] because you know what we still got to
[1:35:08] live by this this is our standard right
[1:35:11] here
[1:35:12] now other than that ask what you will
[1:35:17] you know what did you ask to be 15 miles
[1:35:19] closer you didn't even ask it did you
[1:35:21] but god knew if they run you 20 miles
[1:35:23] away you'd be going lord i wish i'd
[1:35:25] asked for it
[1:35:25] he just went ahead and gave it to you
[1:35:27] man what a mighty god we serve let's
[1:35:29] sing a song god bless you
[1:35:31] listen the footsteps of the righteous
[1:35:33] are ordered of the lord
[1:35:34] are good footsteps of a good man look it
[1:35:36] up right of a good man is ordered to the
[1:35:38] lord
[1:35:38] so i believe every time we look at
[1:35:40] brother ryan all the different things
[1:35:42] that anybody's testimony look how god
[1:35:44] has just he shifts a whole company
[1:35:48] he shut down one sometime for somebody
[1:35:50] just shut the whole sister johnny
[1:35:52] sister johnny was living in new york and
[1:35:54] they were getting ready to shut the
[1:35:55] thing down
[1:35:57] where she was working so she just got a
[1:35:59] promotion and every time it was a
[1:36:00] promotion i think
[1:36:02] she got moved to a different position
[1:36:04] right they were going to close this
[1:36:05] whole division
[1:36:07] but they're set a bride they're set one
[1:36:09] of god's children that needed to work
[1:36:12] so she could get retirement so she could
[1:36:14] move back down here
[1:36:17] you don't think god don't work yeah god
[1:36:18] does every bit of that
[1:36:20] because they'd shut that thing down off
[1:36:22] that division right here and all of a
[1:36:23] sudden
[1:36:24] two weeks later their sister johnny
[1:36:25] popped up over here in this division
[1:36:27] over here of
[1:36:28] wherever she worked for a city bank or
[1:36:29] somewhere like that but she can tell you
[1:36:31] the story
[1:36:32] but how many times have you done that
[1:36:33] all through your life it's not been a
[1:36:36] chance i don't not believe in chance i
[1:36:37] do not believe in luck
[1:36:40] i believe in the providence of god and
[1:36:42] but the providence of god when he wrote
[1:36:44] this word right here it's already done
[1:36:47] can't change it's settled
[1:36:50] but you know what the bible says he
[1:36:52] knows what you're going to ask
[1:36:54] before you even ask him because you
[1:36:56] would have probably said lord why didn't
[1:36:58] you make that 15.
[1:36:59] he just said go and give him 15 miles
[1:37:00] closer i think that's wonderful
[1:37:02] i think that deserves a hand clown i
[1:37:05] think that deserves
[1:37:06] thank you god
[1:37:06] [Applause]
[1:37:09] that he's mindful even in this wicked
[1:37:11] world we live in he's still mindful
[1:37:13] and listen he's the only one that can
[1:37:15] change the mind
[1:37:17] of an owner of have you ever tried
[1:37:18] trying to change your mind though bob
[1:37:20] you ever trying to
[1:37:20] change the minds of them lawyers down
[1:37:22] there oh buddy
[1:37:24] it's not impossible with god though
[1:37:27] because all he's going to do is just
[1:37:29] change and
[1:37:29] and you can't even the devil can't do
[1:37:31] nothing about it
[1:37:33] but god changes the mind of people
[1:37:37] to fit me in you folks let me tell you
[1:37:39] something he loves us
[1:37:41] and like the scripture says there's not
[1:37:42] one hair on your head
[1:37:45] she'll perish you say well i'm losing my
[1:37:47] hair well no you're not
[1:37:49] you're going to have every bit of it
[1:37:50] because god said right here there shall
[1:37:52] not a hair of your head perish
[1:37:55] it's somewhere you'll get it back
[1:37:58] don't worry we come to the change we'll
[1:38:01] get it back
[1:38:02] some of you don't need it some of you do
[1:38:05] brother john let's say so

[1:38:08] this
[1:38:12] and followed jesus
[1:38:17] oh take up your cross
[1:38:23] every day
[1:38:28] don't be afraid

[1:39:01] every day
[1:39:11] [Applause]
[1:39:14] [Music]
[1:39:23] every morning
[1:39:28] [Music]
[1:39:39] that carried that cross came back on the
[1:39:40] day of pentecost
[1:39:55] [Music]
[1:39:57] one more time
[1:40:08] follow jesus
[1:40:12] oh take up your calls
[1:40:17] every day
[1:40:24] [Music]
[1:40:34] take up your cross and follow him
[1:40:40] listen jesus didn't try to be strange
[1:40:43] but what he was made him strange amen
[1:40:47] he didn't try to act weird he acted what
[1:40:49] he was
[1:40:50] and it was weird to the world
[1:40:53] that's why we as believers in this end
[1:40:57] time the world thinks we're weird
[1:41:01] i mean really well why do you do this
[1:41:02] why the bible tells us to do it
[1:41:06] we're the only bible believing people in
[1:41:08] the face of the earth i don't care what
[1:41:09] anybody says
[1:41:10] i'll challenge anybody in the world
[1:41:12] we're the only full bible believing
[1:41:14] people on the face of the earth right
[1:41:15] now
[1:41:16] and if you don't believe that then you
[1:41:17] can't be bribed right
[1:41:20] because what's inside of you is what
[1:41:21] wrote this bible
[1:41:23] you can't deny can satan cast out satan
[1:41:25] can you deny the word if you've got the
[1:41:27] word inside of you you can't do that
[1:41:30] sure you can be confused and there can
[1:41:31] be things but ye listen
[1:41:34] the seventh seal is open so the book is
[1:41:36] an open book now the journey is is to go
[1:41:38] in there and eat that pizza or i mean uh
[1:41:40] going to eat that steak
[1:41:42] amen when that book was open
[1:41:45] that open from eternity to eternity
[1:41:51] we now know everything we need to know
[1:41:54] to get out of here
[1:41:56] it's already inside of you the problem
[1:41:58] is is we suppress it so much and we let
[1:42:00] this demon do this and we let this devil
[1:42:02] do that
[1:42:03] we let this situation do that we let
[1:42:05] this take away our joy and our happiness
[1:42:07] listen
[1:42:11] we're the bride of jesus christ amen
[1:42:14] and it's not my job or brother dale's
[1:42:17] job
[1:42:20] to protect you it's your father's job to
[1:42:23] protect you
[1:42:25] we just tell you what your father's
[1:42:26] already said about you we don't tell you
[1:42:28] no different strains
[1:42:29] doctor no we just say exactly what the
[1:42:31] father remember what my brother brown
[1:42:32] said he said
[1:42:33] what is the preacher's job to break the
[1:42:36] scale
[1:42:37] over the people's eyes that satan in
[1:42:39] other words has put over your eyes all
[1:42:40] during the week and give you doubts and
[1:42:42] give you
[1:42:43] fears and give you anxiety and give you
[1:42:45] this and give you that
[1:42:46] our job is is to get into the bible and
[1:42:49] say look
[1:42:52] this is what he's already said about you
[1:42:54] we win
[1:42:56] yeah wait a minute the bride will win
[1:42:59] amen right
[1:43:00] it might have looked real bad brother
[1:43:02] john it read the worst time
[1:43:04] if you were somebody standing looking at
[1:43:05] calvary and you
[1:43:07] what did all the what did all the guys
[1:43:09] do they left they run
[1:43:11] they scattered even when they
[1:43:14] resurrected
[1:43:16] peter went fishing i can't understand
[1:43:19] that
[1:43:20] but i can now peter didn't have a
[1:43:22] revelation really who that was right
[1:43:24] but boy on the day of pentecost though
[1:43:27] peter was his first guy
[1:43:29] he was the first guy to stand up and he
[1:43:31] said um i think i got some keys i need
[1:43:33] to use
[1:43:35] because that man gave me some keys and
[1:43:37] and now on the day of pentecost he's now
[1:43:39] inside of me so i think i'm going to use
[1:43:40] these keys he said
[1:43:43] repent every one of you
[1:43:47] and be baptized in the name of jesus
[1:43:48] christ for the mission of sin and you
[1:43:50] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[1:43:52] for the promises unto you and your
[1:43:53] children and to them
[1:43:55] that are afar off all the way into seven
[1:43:58] church ages
[1:43:59] here we are we've come up to the time
[1:44:02] they would love to be here how many
[1:44:03] times did
[1:44:04] did the prophet tell us that and jesus
[1:44:06] even said look
[1:44:07] he said those prophets desired to see
[1:44:10] your day
[1:44:14] well all those prophets even paul
[1:44:17] irenaeus
[1:44:18] all of them desired to be standing right
[1:44:20] here they wanted to see this right here
[1:44:22] come to fruition
[1:44:24] because they didn't see it in their day
[1:44:27] but
[1:44:27] they'll see it in this day when we meet
[1:44:30] them they're going to say how in the
[1:44:31] world did you make it through laodicea
[1:44:34] darkest time most demons most spiritual
[1:44:37] devils in the world
[1:44:38] paul said i saw it but i didn't know
[1:44:40] exactly what was going on
[1:44:42] but god sent us a prophet to turn the
[1:44:44] light on not make new light
[1:44:46] right come on now he didn't make new
[1:44:49] light
[1:44:50] he'd give us light on what's already
[1:44:52] been here in the bible
