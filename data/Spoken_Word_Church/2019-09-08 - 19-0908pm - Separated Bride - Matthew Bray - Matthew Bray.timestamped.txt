[18:26] I'm so glad for Jesus amen I'm glad that
[18:30] he's been made real in my life
[18:32] maybe now Cheryl brother wait last night
[18:34] I said I really am thankful to God that
[18:36] I met Jesus before I got indoctrinated
[18:39] with the message amen and I met the Lord
[18:43] Jesus in the power of his resurrection
[18:46] and he taught me who brother Branham was
[18:49] and he told me how important the message
[18:51] was and he began to reveal to me the
[18:54] things out from the spoken word amen I'd
[18:56] like to invite your attention this
[18:58] afternoon in Luke chapter 12
[19:00] praise God really appreciated that
[19:02] scripture reading this morning that
[19:04] y'all had and I hope the word of the
[19:07] Lord was a blessing to your heart this
[19:09] morning praise God I really do believe
[19:12] we're in a bride age I believe we're in
[19:14] a age of the spiritual womb brother
[19:17] Branham said that the body started from
[19:19] the feet and went up to the head the
[19:22] Pentecostals had the tongues and the
[19:23] Prophet was the seer and brother Branham
[19:26] mentioned the intelligence coming down
[19:28] amen and pick up your pen and write
[19:30] brother Branham said the word or the
[19:32] Holy Spirit said through the prophet the
[19:35] word is in the bride and the mind of
[19:38] Christ to know what he what's done with
[19:40] the word so the true bride has the mind
[19:43] of Christ amen
[19:45] gonna read two passages and have a word
[19:46] of Prayer Luke chapter 12 verse 51 and
[19:49] 52 I don't know if you've ever noticed
[19:51] when I'm kind of in Bible numerix
[19:53] numerology a little bit brother Brennan
[19:56] said the Bible mathematics is perfect
[19:58] when you see patterns and themes it's
[20:00] undeniable and the Lord Jesus is perfect
[20:05] they men so you heard brother Graham
[20:07] talking about them keys in that tape
[20:09] services earlier the keys the key of
[20:12] faith amen
[20:13] so uh verse 51 52 supposing that I am
[20:20] come to give peace on earth I tell you
[20:23] nay but rather division verse 52 for
[20:28] from henceforth
[20:29] there shall be five in one house divided
[20:31] three against two and two against three
[20:34] let's pray blessed father God as we come
[20:38] to this part of the afternoon service
[20:40] Lord we just asked father that your Holy
[20:42] Spirit would come rest O Lord in our
[20:45] hearts in such a mighty and special way
[20:47] Lord Jesus we need to hear your voice we
[20:50] need to receive the perception that is
[20:52] divine a conception God by your Holy
[20:55] Spirit and word and I asked father for
[20:58] each and every individual to be so
[20:59] blessed and so caught up Lord and seated
[21:02] in heavenly places in Christ Jesus that
[21:05] each and every individual recognize
[21:07] where they're walking that each and
[21:08] every one of us God will be so
[21:10] conscience Lord of what you're saying
[21:12] how you are moving what you want us to
[21:14] do
[21:15] how you want us to fulfill your pleasure
[21:17] in this day God we just not only pray
[21:20] for the Saints here but worldwide your
[21:22] precious bride that's been called out
[21:24] and separated and how your prophet
[21:27] taught us how to rightly divide the word
[21:29] and now today since the seals are open
[21:32] we see a bride out from a church just
[21:34] like you sent your Exodus prophet so
[21:36] many years ago God to bring Israel out
[21:38] of Egypt that nation out of a nation now
[21:41] we see a bride out from the church world
[21:44] Lord and you're getting ready to glorify
[21:47] her and take her off the earth father
[21:49] and we want to be made ready we want to
[21:51] be seeing ourselves in that reality the
[21:53] quickening and the imparting of Christ
[21:55] himself into us through Jesus Christ's
[21:58] name we pray and ask your blessings over
[21:59] the hearing and their speaking of your
[22:01] word today in Jesus Christ our Lord amen
[22:04] amen god bless you can have your seats
[22:06] so this passage is like all the other
[22:10] passages in the Bible it's the truth we
[22:14] made a point today about how the six
[22:17] seals don't really cause a whole lot of
[22:20] controversy among message folks it's
[22:22] always the seventh seal that seems to be
[22:25] the point of contention and if you
[22:27] notice what Jesus is saying here suppose
[22:29] he that I am come and the seventh seal
[22:33] is the coming of the Lord so he says I
[22:36] am come not to bring peace but division
[22:40] so out of all seven sea
[22:43] which seal caused the most division it's
[22:46] the seventh seal because the seventh
[22:48] seal is the mystery of his coming it's
[22:51] the secret of his coming is that right
[22:53] when brother Branham preached the
[22:55] rapture message he took this to Saint
[22:56] John chapter 11 and brother Branham
[22:59] showed us shout and voice right there in
[23:01] chapter 11 that's right so if you can
[23:04] see shout and that's Jesus coming to
[23:06] Mary and Martha that's Jesus Christ
[23:08] uniting with the living and then he went
[23:11] to the tomb of Lazarus and brother
[23:13] Branham taught us the voice of the
[23:14] resurrection spoke and raised Lazarus is
[23:17] that right but Jesus came to Mary and
[23:19] Martha first how many remember the date
[23:22] the cloud appeared in Arizona sky
[23:23] February 28 and in Saint John 11 verse
[23:27] 28 Martha went to Mary and said the
[23:30] master is come and calleth for thee is
[23:34] that right so the master came United
[23:37] with Mary and Martha then called Lazarus
[23:39] from the grave then in chapter 12 you
[23:41] see Jesus sitting at a table feast with
[23:45] the one that was raised from the dead
[23:46] Lazarus and then the one that was living
[23:49] Mary and Martha you got shot voice and
[23:52] Trump that's where brother brown showed
[23:53] us shout watching Trump and Saint John
[23:56] chapter 11 so everything that we're into
[23:58] now has been foreshadowed in the Bible
[24:00] this move of God in the last days the
[24:03] calling out of a bride the bride being
[24:05] taken to the marriage supper of the Lamb
[24:06] it's all right in here in this Bible is
[24:09] that right so it's important when you
[24:11] hear the Prophet speaks something right
[24:14] that spoken word unlocks and opens the
[24:17] mystery in the scripture have to take
[24:20] the Bible it have to take the word of
[24:21] the message back to the Bible is that
[24:23] right
[24:24] so in Luke 12 51 suppose D that I am
[24:30] come to give peace on earth
[24:33] nay but division so we see a lot of
[24:38] division don't we but in spite of all
[24:40] that division we see Christ uniting with
[24:43] an elected bride the one great thing
[24:46] that was brought to my attention in
[24:48] these last last several months where the
[24:51] weight is how that in the Book of Ruth
[24:53] when you open it up the very first verse
[24:56] you the setting in which Ruth the story
[24:59] Ruth has taken place it says in the days
[25:01] of judges write the days of judges is
[25:06] after the days of Joshua and in the days
[25:08] of the judges is when every man did what
[25:10] was right in his own eyes and in spite
[25:13] of all that static and in spite of all
[25:16] that confusion in Israel there was a
[25:18] Gentile bride coming into marriage union
[25:20] with Boaz now I don't know about you
[25:23] that then courage is my heart because
[25:26] the main thing is your marriage union
[25:28] with Christ that's right because there's
[25:31] going to be false ministers there's
[25:33] going to be false believers the true
[25:36] Bride of Christ is always counterfeited
[25:38] there is a false bride and there is a
[25:40] true bride there's a false ministry but
[25:44] there is a true ministry spirit-filled
[25:46] born-again sons of God anointed to speak
[25:49] the word in this hour because in
[25:51] Revelation chapter 10 8 to 11 John
[25:54] represents the bride is that right and
[25:58] the Lord told John
[26:00] the Brides thou must prophesy again but
[26:04] he wasn't fit to prophesy until after he
[26:06] ate the book huh got it take the
[26:09] prophets message back to the Bible to
[26:11] get a real revelation where do you think
[26:13] brother Brown got his message from right
[26:16] out of the Bible and brother being told
[26:20] us when you're sitting in the cool of
[26:21] your room listening to a tape and when
[26:24] you hear something strike turn the tape
[26:27] off and go get the scripture that's a
[26:30] quote you hear a press play all the time
[26:33] there's one brother Brent says turn the
[26:34] tape off and go get the scripture huh
[26:37] got to take the prophets message back to
[26:40] the Bible if your doctrine doesn't line
[26:42] up with written word and spoken word I
[26:44] think you need to get rid of it if you
[26:47] can't take your idea of what you think
[26:49] brother Branham 'san and show it from
[26:51] the Bible from Genesis to Revelation I
[26:53] don't really care for it too much that's
[26:56] right because when you see the prophets
[26:59] message in the Bible you are a blessed
[27:01] person
[27:02] very blessed if you just try to take the
[27:05] message on its own you're doing wrong
[27:07] say brother branham said it I believe it
[27:12] brother BAM told you to dig in that word
[27:16] brother Brown told us basically in
[27:19] different ways to take the message back
[27:21] to the Bible
[27:22] check me check the Bible check me if I'm
[27:25] in the scripture or not is that right so
[27:29] we're very happy in this hour our little
[27:33] church there in Mobile the sweet Lord
[27:35] Jesus has been so faithful to us to
[27:37] guide us we listened to tapes we stayed
[27:39] the prophets message but he allows us to
[27:41] make discoveries in that Bible we have
[27:44] found places in the word that speaking
[27:47] directly to us we have found our
[27:49] identification in the Bible we found our
[27:52] names written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[27:53] we see ourselves in a plan of redemption
[27:55] and this is what bringing faith for
[27:58] translation they men and we like to
[28:02] fellowship around it too we like that we
[28:04] like to talk to ministers we'd like to
[28:06] talk to believers we like to talk to the
[28:08] housewife we like to talk to the mailman
[28:10] amen about these great revelations that
[28:13] God has brought by vindicated prophet
[28:15] and now it's moving in an endtime bride
[28:18] making her ready and prepared for a
[28:20] rapture amen
[28:21] so I want you to notice in verse 52 for
[28:26] from henceforth there shall be five in
[28:28] one house right three against two and
[28:31] two against three I want to share with
[28:34] you something the Lord was dealing me
[28:35] about because I was meditating in some
[28:38] of the things I was noticing about
[28:39] translation the rapture changed in
[28:42] dimensions and I was noticing brother
[28:44] way to number 51 and the Holy Spirit
[28:47] spoke to my heart and told me to look up
[28:49] the first verse in the whole Bible
[28:51] that's verse number 51 so I went from
[28:55] Genesis 1 when all the way and found it
[28:57] in Genesis 24 Genesis chapter 24 is the
[29:01] longest chapter in the whole book of
[29:03] Genesis that's the chapter Abraham sent
[29:06] Eleazar to go call Rebecca for Isaac
[29:09] verse 51 the first verse in the Bible
[29:12] number 51 says behold
[29:15] is before the take her and go and let
[29:18] her be that master sons wife as the Lord
[29:21] has spoken so I want to show you today
[29:24] this principle of how the bride is a
[29:26] separated people the true Bride of
[29:29] Christ and this principle of separation
[29:31] and how it's associated with the number
[29:33] 51 the number 51 is 17 times 3
[29:37] you notice number 17 is a powerful
[29:40] number in brother branham's ministry and
[29:42] brother brown's life when brother
[29:44] Branham had that hunting accident he was
[29:46] shot in the back of the legs the doctor
[29:48] said your heart's only beaten 17 times a
[29:50] minute when he went to India he had 17
[29:52] different religions resist in him right
[29:54] which sister hope was on her deathbed
[29:56] she who told brother Brown bought a
[29:58] rifle that she had been secretly hiding
[30:00] money to save up to buy him that rifle
[30:02] that rifle was only 17 dollars right and
[30:06] then when brother Branham was baptized
[30:08] in Ohio River and the pillar fire came
[30:10] down what number of person was he
[30:12] baptizing when the pillar fire came Amen
[30:15] 17th person so in the in the Bible the
[30:19] first time that Elijah's ever mentioned
[30:21] in the whole Bible is first Kings
[30:22] chapter 17 right so in Luke chapter 1
[30:26] verse 17 it says he shall go before him
[30:28] the spear and power of Elijah speaking
[30:30] of John the Baptist st. James 5:17 says
[30:33] Elijah is a man of like passions as we
[30:35] are so the number 17 being connected
[30:38] with Elijah and Elijah being connected
[30:41] with the rapture first that's the Loni's
[30:44] force 17 but we which are alive and
[30:46] remain shall be caught up is that right
[30:49] so the number 17 is associated with the
[30:52] vindication of a prophet and the
[30:54] fulfillment of prophecy and the rapture
[30:57] the translation of the bride is
[30:59] definitely a fulfillment of prophecy
[31:01] because we are told and we are taught
[31:04] that our bodies are going to be changed
[31:06] into atoms and we're going to go from
[31:08] time into eternity and this great thing
[31:11] has been foreshadowed down through the
[31:12] Bible and I'd like to meditate those
[31:15] things don't you because those are the
[31:17] things that speaking of the endtime
[31:19] bride that's right
[31:21] think about it friends even our precious
[31:23] brother branham has been taken over on
[31:26] the other side he's got to come back in
[31:28] the resurrect
[31:28] and then go back home there's an endtime
[31:31] bride that's been left here that don't
[31:33] go home by way of the grave she goes
[31:36] home and straight to heaven in a body
[31:38] change does that rise in those in the
[31:41] message spoken our souls that are in
[31:43] prison now brother Brent honest people
[31:44] don't have to die to go to hell they're
[31:46] in Hell right now hell's being created
[31:48] on earth what just says it is on that
[31:51] side so is it for the divine side
[31:53] there's people here they'll have to die
[31:55] to go to heaven
[31:55] your souls already translated over there
[31:58] you're seated in heavenly places in
[31:59] Christ Jesus you're living in the age
[32:02] where full Redemption is revealed full
[32:05] redemption is your body change are you
[32:08] in that channel can you see it on
[32:10] folding in your life oh I hope so so the
[32:16] Lord still me about this and I'm seeing
[32:18] man look at all these things in the
[32:19] Bible here because the bride being
[32:22] separated is a big deal isn't that not a
[32:24] big deal to you because in the church
[32:27] ages there was churches churches Brides
[32:29] Brides right and everybody was a
[32:32] Christian everybody in church was praise
[32:34] God hallelujah and then finally when a
[32:37] prophet comes there's a distinction made
[32:41] like whenever Israel was down in Egypt
[32:43] you know you really couldn't see a whole
[32:45] lot there you know there was Hebrews and
[32:47] there was Egyptians and they was just
[32:48] all mixed in there but when Moses came
[32:51] all of a sudden there's a difference
[32:53] being made a separation was coming so
[32:57] one deal with this principle this
[33:00] principle of separation okay because we
[33:03] don't know when the bride's taken off
[33:04] the earth that's a pretty mighty
[33:05] separation when you say when you're
[33:08] changed from more from Mortal to
[33:10] immortal 'ti you're separated how many
[33:13] other precious blood of Jesus separates
[33:15] you from your sins is that right have
[33:17] you been a separated out are you
[33:20] distinct are you distinct are you
[33:22] separated unto Christ now that's an
[33:26] important point because not only are we
[33:27] separated but we got to be separated on
[33:29] to something we're not separated on to a
[33:33] church we're not separated on to a flesh
[33:36] and blood and hand we're not feeding on
[33:38] a man we're feeding on the body word of
[33:41] the
[33:41] we've been separated and our diet is
[33:45] reflecting the fact that were separated
[33:47] people Dayman like the priest could only
[33:50] certain food because he's separated for
[33:52] a work for a purpose so the enzyme bride
[33:55] is a separated people and her diet
[33:56] reflects that Amen so behold Rebekah is
[34:03] before you take her and go
[34:05] and let her be that master son's wife as
[34:07] the Lord has spoken what a message I say
[34:11] the bride is before us let her go let
[34:15] her go be united in the marriage supper
[34:17] Amen let the word unite with the word
[34:19] now is that right
[34:22] so I'm meditating along these lines and
[34:25] I'm thinking look at this here now this
[34:27] passage in 52 from henceforth there
[34:30] shall be five in one house divided when
[34:32] you read the story there in Genesis 24
[34:35] you find out that Ellie Azar's going to
[34:38] the house of Rebecca and he's in the
[34:40] house explains to them that his master
[34:42] Abraham sent him and brother Branham
[34:45] talks about it you can read it in the
[34:46] word there was Laban but though
[34:49] Rebecca's mother Rebecca and Eleazar
[34:52] that's five right well L is I was there
[34:56] to pull Rebecca out so there's two
[34:58] against three and three against two
[35:00] company lays that come to that house he
[35:02] separated Rebecca from her own house is
[35:05] that right then the message separate
[35:07] people doesn't even the revelation
[35:10] separate Abel from Cain it's something
[35:14] isn't it now when you start letting the
[35:17] Holy Spirit lead you down this path it
[35:19] has enormous its massive the fact that
[35:22] the bride is a separated people what is
[35:26] it that distinguishes her and separates
[35:28] her it's really the revelation of the
[35:31] word right so I got curious now if I see
[35:36] the first 51 in the Bible and that sets
[35:39] a precedent to something what's the last
[35:41] 51 in the Bible I said Lord you got me
[35:44] going here so I looked up the last 51 in
[35:47] the Bible it's 1st Corinthians 15:51
[35:50] behold I show you a mystery we shall not
[35:53] all sleep but we shall be changed
[35:55] so I put that verse with that verse and
[35:58] I'm seeing something amen doesn't
[36:01] brother Brown teach us that all
[36:02] scripture dovetails with Scripture
[36:05] behold I show you a mystery we shall not
[36:07] all sleep but we shall be changed now
[36:10] the part where it says we shall not all
[36:12] sleep that's the end time bride that's
[36:16] the ones that are living this verse 51
[36:18] is speaking of those that are alive and
[36:20] remain those that are alive and remain
[36:23] is 1st Thessalonians 4:17 right but this
[36:27] verse 51 in the first verse 51 is all
[36:30] connected to the endtime bride being
[36:32] called out separated and taken right you
[36:37] ready to get into it all right I try to
[36:40] go slow because I don't want to preach
[36:41] over it I want you to conceive this is
[36:44] the age of conception amen
[36:47] so this is an awesome thing because the
[36:50] Lord don't never change amen the
[36:54] scripture in Ecclesiastes I like to
[36:56] share with you real fast Ecclesiastes
[36:59] chapter 3 verse 14 and 15 you are
[37:03] familiar with this I'm sure but he says
[37:05] I know that whatsoever God doeth it
[37:07] shall be for ever amen
[37:10] nothing can be put to it nor anything
[37:13] taken from it and God do it that that
[37:15] men should fear before him that which
[37:19] hath been is now there's nothing new
[37:22] Under the Sun that which has been is now
[37:26] and that which is to be has already been
[37:29] has it there when brother Branham
[37:31] preached the rapture message didn't he
[37:32] show us there were already raptures
[37:34] don't they represent the rapture will
[37:36] into now sure they prefigure they
[37:39] foreshadow so friends I'm just trying to
[37:42] get you understand how important it is
[37:43] to meditate dwell in these things watch
[37:47] the word keep your eyes on the word
[37:50] there's a coat where brother Brown says
[37:52] don't keep your eyes on the messenger
[37:54] but keep your eyes on the message watch
[37:57] the word be conscience of what is
[37:58] unfolding through the word there is a
[38:01] message to comprehend there's something
[38:04] to actually conceived by and that is
[38:08] Virtue's coming into you to represent
[38:11] himself in flesh the Lord Jesus is not
[38:14] without a body today he has mortal flesh
[38:17] that he's veiled in and it's a bride
[38:20] amen
[38:22] so it's important you don't allow Church
[38:25] and church politics and debate and
[38:28] fussing and division to really distract
[38:31] you from receive an impartation of
[38:33] Revelation from Christ because when
[38:36] people get their feelings hurt coldness
[38:38] and indifference come young people
[38:41] struggle over what it's all about and
[38:43] there's so much division you know and I
[38:45] got young people I've spoken with you
[38:48] know or just you know I don't want to
[38:50] get into it so much but you know young
[38:52] people get to a certain age they start
[38:53] looking for spouses and they really got
[38:55] to trust the Lord for the right kind of
[38:56] spouse and then some young people
[38:59] amongst us are really looking for
[39:01] spiritual people to marry I mean they
[39:02] really don't want to just married us
[39:04] anybody and it's getting harder and
[39:06] harder to find young people that are
[39:09] really sold out to Jesus because brother
[39:13] Brown taught us that we before we even
[39:15] get married we should really have the
[39:16] Holy Ghost so it's a very very serious
[39:20] issue to make sure that when you're
[39:22] involved with somebody is that something
[39:24] I truly sold out to Christ is there so
[39:27] in fellowship with Christ because
[39:29] there's many people that profess to
[39:31] believe the message now the message has
[39:34] been here for decades and the message
[39:36] has spread around the world and we got
[39:38] all kinds of professors in the message
[39:41] but Bertman said there's professors
[39:43] without a possession so there's a
[39:46] difference between being a message
[39:48] professor than a message possessor
[39:51] that's right your true possession is
[39:54] Christ Jesus that imparts his own life
[39:58] into you not just a doctrine up here but
[40:01] a life in here do you understand that's
[40:05] reality so if you get Christ in here he
[40:07] illuminates the mind to the doctrine but
[40:10] the doctrine is typed by water but
[40:12] revelation is typed by wine and it takes
[40:14] Jesus to turn that water into one it's
[40:18] good to have
[40:19] brother Brown said every Church has
[40:20] doctrine a church without a doctor's
[40:22] like a fish without a backbone but the
[40:25] doctrine has to become wine the water
[40:28] has to become wine your doctrine should
[40:31] be stimulating that's right is that
[40:35] right so I'm going on through here
[40:38] finding all kinds of things and it's
[40:42] really fascinating to see then we'll
[40:44] just go over some scriptures today so
[40:45] you can see some continuity and some
[40:48] interesting aspects of this principle of
[40:50] separation division are dividing okay
[40:54] and I would like for the brothers to
[40:56] bring up on the screen my quote from the
[41:00] Seventh Seal that I was going to share
[41:02] today on this I'm going to try to hit
[41:06] two things at once if you look at this
[41:08] verse right here from the Seventh Seal I
[41:10] want to deal with this again it's you
[41:11] know about numbers but brother Branham
[41:13] mentions it so we're going to deal with
[41:14] it there's been a three-fold purpose in
[41:17] all these things right very very
[41:21] profound got the white horse the red
[41:24] horse and the black horse that's a
[41:25] three-fold purpose but it all mixes
[41:28] together in the fourth horse is that
[41:30] right you got justification
[41:31] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[41:33] and it all goes together to make
[41:34] adoption placed sons and daughters of
[41:37] God you got Abraham Isaac and Jacob is
[41:41] that it no you got Joseph perfection
[41:44] Joseph is a perfect type of adoption
[41:47] being placed right so we're in adoption
[41:50] age right now for the brim said this is
[41:52] the age of adoption but it takes
[41:55] justification sanctification batches and
[41:57] all the dose before you can recognize
[41:58] your true position in Christ is that
[42:01] right so it all goes together
[42:04] a three-fold purpose in what brother and
[42:06] said all these things you're so spirit
[42:11] and body is that right he's the same
[42:14] yesterday today and forever I mean we
[42:16] could just exhaust the point right so
[42:19] that brings us back to a three wasn't
[42:23] brother Browns ministry three pools okay
[42:26] and a seven again oh he had three pools
[42:30] and seven mysteries to teach and preach
[42:32] reveal right that brings us back to a 3
[42:37] and a 7 again see seven seals seven
[42:39] vowels and so forth now in threes and
[42:42] sevens it's God's number in his
[42:45] mathematics of revealing his word this
[42:50] pause a minute think this is why I
[42:52] appointed to meditating the message I
[42:54] want to go too fast just relax
[42:57] what he said God's mathematics of
[43:00] revealing his word is threes and sevens
[43:06] well check this out Britain sisters in
[43:08] the third month in 1963 brother Branham
[43:12] preached the seals guess what Days
[43:14] started preaching them on March 17th
[43:17] right revelations 10 7 the message is
[43:22] perfect with the Bible that's all I want
[43:25] to demonstrate here today the message
[43:27] must be taken back to the Bible you
[43:29] weave it back and forth
[43:30] even in our precious brother Billy Paul
[43:32] teaches us that's like the front sight
[43:34] and a rear sight of a rival you got to
[43:36] line them up and if you don't line them
[43:38] up you'll never be accurate so don't
[43:41] just give me a quote let's take the
[43:44] message back to the Bible let's see the
[43:47] continuity of the word from Genesis to
[43:49] Revelation amen because that's what real
[43:52] faith is gonna come from it taking the
[43:54] spoken word with the written word all
[43:57] right I think you agree with that oh
[43:59] praise the Lord so let's just look at
[44:02] this now brother branham's giving us a
[44:05] key you just heard it was so perfect
[44:07] when you played that part of the message
[44:08] it's a key
[44:10] this spoken word right here is a key
[44:12] God's mathematics of revealing his word
[44:15] is threes and sevens right March is the
[44:19] third month of the year he preaches the
[44:21] seven seals in March in July 1963 he
[44:26] preaches Christ the mystery of God
[44:27] revealed what does he teach us in that
[44:29] sermon the whole Bible is a three-fold
[44:31] purpose three-fold purpose in the
[44:34] seventh month seven seals in the third
[44:36] month I could just beat you to death
[44:39] with this stuff
[44:40] it's just over and over it's because the
[44:43] message is perfect right so he's
[44:47] preaching the seven seals right by
[44:50] revelation he's bringing us the seven
[44:51] seals right if you look at the format of
[44:54] the sermons there's actually seven seals
[44:57] but he adds three sermons to it God high
[45:01] in simplicity the breach in questions
[45:03] and answers and gods mathematics of
[45:05] revealing his word is threes and sevens
[45:08] right
[45:09] William Marian Branham is three names
[45:11] with seven letters in book revelations
[45:15] chapter three brother Branham is the
[45:16] seventh church age messenger but over in
[45:19] revelations 14 he's the third angel is
[45:24] that right brother Dale so he's
[45:26] connected with the number seven and the
[45:28] number three right so whenever you go
[45:32] and you look at these things and this is
[45:35] just one quote of the Prophet
[45:36] you can spend like a lot of time just
[45:40] digest in that one statement and people
[45:43] think they're just doing so much listen
[45:46] over and over and over again listen one
[45:47] tape after another it's not about how
[45:49] much you listen it's what you're getting
[45:51] out of it when you do just this one
[45:54] statement right
[45:56] God's mathematics of revealing his word
[45:59] is threes and sevens now did you hear
[46:03] brother Branham taught us this Bible is
[46:05] a seventh sealed book and it has a
[46:08] three-fold purpose so when the Seventh
[46:11] Seal is opened brother Branham said the
[46:13] seventh seals a three-fold purpose so
[46:16] when the seventh seal opens it shows you
[46:18] three folds of a mystery that God had in
[46:22] the back part of his mind the reason why
[46:24] that's so good because it's easy for you
[46:27] to understand three one two three seven
[46:31] when you get that so simplified and
[46:34] understood you can study the message in
[46:35] the Bible you can look for those places
[46:38] every time the Bible mentions the number
[46:40] seven watch close most likely it's gonna
[46:42] refer to something like in type the
[46:45] seven church ages like in the message
[46:48] called desperation brother Branham took
[46:49] his text in Jeremiah and he said where
[46:52] Jeremiah the Lord spoke to Jeremiah said
[46:54] you
[46:54] in captivity seventy years but at 70
[46:57] years end I'll bring you back into this
[46:59] land brother Branham says see back to
[47:02] Pentecost it doesn't say that but that's
[47:05] what I mean to the church brother
[47:08] Branham was using the 70 year captivity
[47:11] to type the seven church ages so when
[47:15] you see that huh that's right so when
[47:18] you see that you find out now what books
[47:20] of the Bible are part of the history
[47:23] after the captivity you start seeing
[47:27] Ezra Nehemiah those are restoration
[47:31] books you people are featured in the
[47:34] book of Ezra and in a book of Nehemiah
[47:35] read Nehemiah chapter eight there you
[47:38] are observing the word in a very
[47:41] distinct way during the Feast of
[47:43] Tabernacles in Nehemiah chapter eight
[47:46] mind you they men that's supposed to
[47:50] mean something to message folk because
[47:52] those are restoration books and we've
[47:54] been a restored people back to the faith
[47:57] is that right so whenever the big deals
[48:01] going on with Ezra Nehemiah what is the
[48:03] big deal they're they bring out the book
[48:05] of registry and they start checking
[48:06] people's names and there was a whole
[48:09] group of people that did not even
[48:10] qualify for the ministry because they
[48:12] couldn't find their names in the book
[48:14] the reason why they couldn't find their
[48:16] names in the book is because of a false
[48:18] Union they married into a family took
[48:20] their name instead of stay with their
[48:22] Hebrew name it could be found in the
[48:24] book that doesn't somebody just send out
[48:26] of heaven in his last days with a book
[48:28] in his hand and he's calling names out
[48:30] of that book that's the important thing
[48:33] is to hear your name call from this book
[48:34] right here it's by faith it's by
[48:37] revelation and it's spiritual you don't
[48:39] hear a loud voice in your ear you hear
[48:41] it from your heart amen so God's
[48:45] mathematics are revealing his word as
[48:47] threes and sevens
[48:48] remember what brother Branham taught us
[48:50] we're there seals are in written form
[48:52] Matthew chapter 24 Matthew chapter 24
[48:56] brother Branham was showing us the
[48:58] disciples came to Jesus how many
[49:00] questions did they ask three questions
[49:02] how many seals did brother Branham on or
[49:04] did the Lord Jesus unfold in that
[49:05] chapter right that's your
[49:08] a lot of people only see six seals in
[49:10] Matthew 24 you better look a little
[49:12] closer and at the end of the chapter
[49:15] what is going on
[49:16] jesus said to be two in the bed one
[49:18] shall be taken and the other left
[49:20] what did Genesis 24 51 say behold
[49:23] Rebekah's before they take her and go
[49:25] and in Matthew 24 one shall be taken and
[49:29] the other left two will be grinding at
[49:32] the mill one shall be taken and the
[49:33] other left right - two people in the
[49:37] field one shall be taken and the other
[49:39] left
[49:39] and you go down to that very last part
[49:42] of that chapter guess how many verses
[49:44] are in Matthew chapter 24 51 alright
[49:49] notice Matthew chapter 24 is the seven
[49:53] seals one shall be taken and the other
[49:56] left right where did I take you to in
[49:58] Genesis Genesis 20 the bride being
[50:01] taken out the Seventh Seal alright so
[50:05] that is that simple enough for you do
[50:08] you see the continuity of and how the
[50:10] message in the Bible is perfect with one
[50:12] another and when you get into those
[50:14] things you really start saying things
[50:17] more and more unfold I mean it's an
[50:19] eternal word so it just keeps unfolding
[50:22] because God had this in his mind before
[50:25] the foundation of the world he had it
[50:27] placed in the Bible through types and
[50:29] allegory and prophetic continuity of the
[50:32] word so what is such a glorious deal is
[50:36] to see yourself in that pattern and
[50:39] natural real faith is because the Lord
[50:42] Jesus knew what was written of him and
[50:44] brother Branham was definitely sure what
[50:47] was written of him the glorious thing
[50:49] about the Prophet is whenever he told me
[50:51] to he said me too honey I'm going to
[50:53] noon woods and I ain't coming out so the
[50:55] Lord takes this thing away from me
[50:56] so when he goes to his place in his way
[50:59] and he says one o'clock came two o'clock
[51:01] came three o'clock came then the light
[51:04] came in the room
[51:04] and the angel says do not fear I've come
[51:07] from the presence of the Lord to tell
[51:10] you about your on under-under
[51:13] misunderstood life but what did the
[51:16] angel do he referred to brother Branham
[51:18] many places in the Bible
[51:21] they angel open the scripture to brother
[51:23] Branham just like Gabriel open the
[51:25] scripture of the Daniel brother branham
[51:28] even said and he referred to me many
[51:30] other scriptures so when brother Branham
[51:33] saw it in the scripture it changed
[51:35] everything
[51:36] the preachers was telling him oh that's
[51:38] of the devil right he said oh brother
[51:40] McKinney pray for me I don't want to be
[51:42] a devil but when he actually seen it in
[51:44] the word cuz angel said the ministry
[51:47] called it Beelzebub then they do it now
[51:48] because they just didn't understand then
[51:51] brother Branham didn't understand but
[51:53] when the angel King angel visitation
[51:56] opening the word right seven angels
[52:00] coming to brother Branham and the word
[52:01] opens amen
[52:04] that's right so an angel came to brother
[52:06] Branham to show him his life in the word
[52:08] and brother Branham is our angel to the
[52:10] sages show us our lives in the word do
[52:13] you take the message that way do you
[52:15] understand that that's the purpose is
[52:17] for you to become conscious of what's
[52:19] written of you so you can be an
[52:21] overcomer in these last days that's what
[52:23] this is all about to bring about a
[52:26] people who can overcome this Satan's
[52:28] Eden and you and I'm telling you you
[52:31] can't overcome unless you see yourself
[52:34] in this plan of redemption personally
[52:36] personally not groups not others not
[52:40] churches and our people not to prophet
[52:42] you personally
[52:44] do you understand is that preaching
[52:47] that's right that's the way it's
[52:49] supposed to be so Matthew chapter 24 is
[52:52] 51 verses right well when the seals are
[52:57] recorded in symbol form in revelations
[53:00] chapter 6 there are 17 verses in that
[53:03] chapter right 51 verses in Matthew 24 so
[53:09] when you see those people being taken
[53:11] out that's the seventh seal that's the
[53:13] bride going amen
[53:15] so it's really a marvelous thing to see
[53:19] the victory and the achievement of
[53:22] Christ and an endtime bride
[53:24] we know the bride scattered around the
[53:27] world and she's from every nation you'll
[53:29] never really get to see the bride until
[53:32] the resurrection
[53:34] you see churches and you see message
[53:36] folk but there's the bride mixed in with
[53:38] all that that's the truth
[53:40] right the thing of it is brother Brown
[53:43] said it over and over and over again but
[53:45] somehow brother Dale people just don't
[53:46] seem to really get with it he deals with
[53:49] Israel as a nation he deals with
[53:52] Gentiles as individuals so it is your
[53:57] individual responsibility to make your
[54:00] calling and election sure to work out
[54:03] your own salvation with fear and
[54:05] trembling you cannot be a Christian by
[54:07] mere association no way no how no shape
[54:11] or no fashion no mere association you
[54:14] must know Jesus Christ
[54:16] personally that's right because you know
[54:20] that thing is still amongst us so strong
[54:22] in people they like to be identified
[54:25] would this click that click sectarianism
[54:28] is just alive and well in the message
[54:30] something like it never was sectarianism
[54:33] division because people want to be
[54:36] identified with this or they identify
[54:39] with that what about just being identify
[54:41] with Jesus huh what our brother bran
[54:44] tell the denominational people get born
[54:46] again fill the Holy Ghost come to know
[54:47] Jesus Christ then go to any church you
[54:49] want to huh is that right what arts
[54:55] Chris she's supposed to be rugged rugged
[54:58] believers not hot dead plants huh I'm
[55:02] not afraid to fellowship with anybody in
[55:04] this message I sit down eat a ham cheese
[55:07] sandwich with tape only I sit down eat a
[55:09] ham and cheese sandwiches that's right
[55:13] because if you don't know Jesus you
[55:15] don't know much anyway
[55:16] you have to know him personally personal
[55:19] Jesus not the doctrine in your head but
[55:22] the life in your heart is that right
[55:26] just preaching a little bit all right
[55:29] now what form is Christ in today he's in
[55:34] the form of a bride where has the word
[55:37] gone it was veiled in a prophet the one
[55:39] man ministry was was fulfilled and
[55:41] brother Branham that's right
[55:43] there is no other prophet and no other
[55:45] capacity but brother Branham
[55:48] forget it unless you got a scripture
[55:50] then we can start talking but if you
[55:53] don't forget it
[55:54] brother Branham was the last one-man
[55:56] ministry now you're talking about a
[55:58] bride being called out from all the
[56:01] nations otherwise why have we translated
[56:04] his message in all the known tongues and
[56:06] sent around the world but to call an end
[56:09] time people the Lord Jesus said except a
[56:12] corn of wheat dies it abides alone but
[56:16] if it dies it brings forth much fruit so
[56:19] the whole point of the son of man is to
[56:21] spread his life out and multiply right
[56:25] so all that life was veiled behind the
[56:27] Prophet but through the spoken word
[56:29] he's multiplied his life in a
[56:32] multi-member body and in that body
[56:36] there's people anointed that's right
[56:40] oh my there's actually people anointed
[56:44] to understand the message
[56:46] there's people anointed amen to live the
[56:48] message there's people that are anointed
[56:50] of Christ to become written epistles of
[56:54] the prophets message that's right the
[56:57] greatest honor you can ever give the
[56:59] Prophet is livers message out let the
[57:01] message live itself out through you
[57:03] that's right is that the truth
[57:06] praise the Lord so the message in the
[57:10] Bible got to be put together that's how
[57:12] we check preachers out that's how we
[57:14] check churches out that's how we check
[57:16] everything out if you don't spend time
[57:19] with Jesus sitting at the feet of Jesus
[57:21] right whenever he came to Mary Martha's
[57:23] house and Martha was all busy and
[57:25] covered about and Jesus said Martha
[57:27] Martha you are busy and coded about many
[57:29] things but mary has chosen that one
[57:33] thing needful to sit at the feet of
[57:35] Jesus and hear the precious words do you
[57:38] spend time with Jesus amen
[57:40] I'm talking about prayer and reading
[57:42] your word right and I'm talking about
[57:45] the hearing of the recorded sermons of a
[57:47] vindicated prophet I'm talking about the
[57:49] fruitfulness of hearing not the
[57:52] religiosity of hearing but the
[57:54] fruitfulness coming to a revelation of
[57:57] faith through the spoken word
[58:00] there's a difference you know because
[58:02] when the Lord Jesus said destroy this
[58:04] temple in three days I'll raise it up
[58:06] most of them thought he was talking
[58:08] about the temple there that heart Herod
[58:10] remodeled but the Bible says he's
[58:12] talking about the temple of his body
[58:13] they heard exactly what he said but they
[58:16] didn't know what he meant
[58:18] so if they did it with Jesus don't you
[58:21] think they do was brother Branham if
[58:24] they heard what Jesus said and then
[58:26] quoted him verbatim and was wrong
[58:28] you know those men quoted Jesus we heard
[58:32] this man say destroy this temple and in
[58:35] three days I'll raise it up they quote
[58:38] exactly what he said brother Mike but
[58:40] they was wrong as the day is long
[58:41] because they didn't know what he meant
[58:45] be careful
[58:46] jesus told his disciples be careful how
[58:49] you hear is that right
[58:51] pray for a revelation pray for the Holy
[58:55] Ghost is that right so go to me to
[58:59] Joshua chapter 18 Joshua chapter 18
[59:03] right brother branham said Joshua is the
[59:06] Ephesian we're in the Ephesians again
[59:08] Joshua right Joshua chapter 18 I'm going
[59:14] to read for you in verse 4 I really had
[59:18] a great time when the Lord showed me
[59:19] this because if there was a prophet in
[59:22] these last days and that prophet was
[59:24] commissioned by God to reveal seven
[59:27] mysteries because there's seven seal
[59:30] mysteries sealed the whole Bible so do
[59:33] you believe that was a scriptural thing
[59:35] absolutely what kind of question is that
[59:37] brother Matthew I've been in a medicine
[59:39] 50 years of course it was scriptural I'm
[59:41] trying to make a point if that is
[59:44] scriptural then it would be foreshadowed
[59:46] in the scripture nazara the opening of
[59:50] the word I showed you this we preached
[59:52] this morning about how Adam was a type
[59:55] of Christ right well what happened to
[59:58] Adam
[59:59] he was put to sleep God opened up his
[1:00:01] side and out came a bride and there was
[1:00:04] a bride age right there in the Garden of
[1:00:06] Eden right so when they put Jesus Christ
[1:00:09] to death on the cross they pierced his
[1:00:10] side where the mic water and blood
[1:00:12] Jesus gave forth the elements to give
[1:00:14] forth birth to an alpha bride and the
[1:00:18] Alpha bride was there so situated so
[1:00:21] perfectly under the headship of Christ
[1:00:24] the Bible said great grace was upon them
[1:00:27] all is that right
[1:00:29] do you know what the earmark or the
[1:00:32] defining characteristic of that early
[1:00:34] church was Jesus himself leadings of
[1:00:39] people not a doctrine or idea or counsel
[1:00:43] people a group of preachers it was Jesus
[1:00:45] Christ himself
[1:00:47] the headship over the churches literally
[1:00:50] Christ on presence that was the
[1:00:53] Apostolic age right didn't if I would
[1:00:56] say no man dared joined himself unto
[1:00:58] them because it was the Lord that added
[1:01:02] daily to the church such as should be
[1:01:05] saved but what do we got today
[1:01:07] any old scallywag can walk through those
[1:01:09] doors and sit in this pew and say I
[1:01:11] believe Malachi 4 right because the
[1:01:16] churches in these last days are the true
[1:01:19] bride like I said it's scatter around
[1:01:21] the world to truly let their not
[1:01:23] together like they was then that was the
[1:01:25] very beginning of the Alpha bride right
[1:01:29] so whenever they open the sight of Jesus
[1:01:32] it gave birth to the Alpha bride so
[1:01:35] there was a sealed up mystery in Adam
[1:01:37] and there's a sealed up mystery in Jesus
[1:01:39] that's what the Bible is a whole canon
[1:01:43] of Scripture and brother Brennan says
[1:01:45] when you read a verse description don't
[1:01:46] see Jesus go back and read it again so
[1:01:49] what is this book a testament to who's
[1:01:51] the speaking of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:01:53] Jehovah of the Old Testaments Jesus of
[1:01:55] the new but this was sealed like Adam
[1:01:59] was sealed
[1:02:00] Adams worth alone Jesus was sealed Jesus
[1:02:04] thought alone but when they got tore
[1:02:06] open outcomes their bride right so in
[1:02:11] these last days after the seventh church
[1:02:13] age messenger has given the revelation
[1:02:15] the seven seals what comes out yeah how
[1:02:19] Jesus in the form of his bride huh
[1:02:23] that's right the bride age
[1:02:25] after the seven charged messenger
[1:02:27] because it took the opening of the seals
[1:02:30] to call the elect
[1:02:32] so now it's not profit profit profit its
[1:02:36] Christ in the bride Christ in the bride
[1:02:38] Christ in the bride it's not Abraham's
[1:02:40] son LasR Abraham sent Eleazar it is
[1:02:44] Rebekah is in marriage Union with Isaac
[1:02:47] right the bride doesn't need to be told
[1:02:50] press play press play God sent a prophet
[1:02:53] she already knows that one of the
[1:02:55] biggest problems with people today is
[1:02:56] they can't retain they can't seem to
[1:02:59] retain things right you tell somebody
[1:03:02] something and five minutes later you got
[1:03:04] to tell it to them again the Holy Spirit
[1:03:08] helps you retain the word right now
[1:03:11] talking spiritual brother don't worry
[1:03:14] about it my wife's got to tell me three
[1:03:16] times brother sometimes four or five I'm
[1:03:21] talking about the word you can probably
[1:03:22] remember the scripture better than you
[1:03:24] can remember anything some I told you
[1:03:25] today before amen that word is powerful
[1:03:29] in the anchors in our souls is that
[1:03:31] right so I got you in Joshua 18 they
[1:03:34] turn the screen off on me Oh Lord Joshua
[1:03:41] 18 four and five give out from among you
[1:03:44] three men for each tribe and I will send
[1:03:47] them and they shall rise and go through
[1:03:49] the land and describe it according to
[1:03:51] the inheritance of them and they shall
[1:03:53] come again to me and they shall divide
[1:03:56] it into seven parts right divided what
[1:04:00] into seven parts the land and then Judah
[1:04:04] shall abide in their coasts on the south
[1:04:05] and in the house of Joseph shadow by on
[1:04:07] their coast in the north okay
[1:04:09] when you read on down through Joshua 18
[1:04:11] Joshua told them to record this land in
[1:04:14] a book okay describe the land into seven
[1:04:18] parts and bring the description hither
[1:04:19] to me that I may cast lots for you here
[1:04:22] before the Lord our God now what they
[1:04:26] did was and what I'm showing you took
[1:04:28] three men out of seven tribes because
[1:04:30] there are seven tribes remaining to be
[1:04:32] placed in the land so Joshua by
[1:04:35] inspiration costs three men out of those
[1:04:37] tribes you got your
[1:04:39] three and seven right because God's
[1:04:41] mathematics of revealing his word is
[1:04:42] threes and sevens
[1:04:43] this is typifying or foreshadowing the
[1:04:46] whole Bible being revealed because this
[1:04:49] seven part book is what they brought
[1:04:51] back to Joshua Joshua stood in the
[1:04:53] doorway of the temple in Shiloh test
[1:04:56] Lots and rightly divided the seven part
[1:04:58] book so the seven remaining tribes can
[1:05:00] know their place and know their position
[1:05:03] in the land of inheritance but I want
[1:05:06] you to show you in Joshua 18 he's using
[1:05:08] a book to do it
[1:05:09] and he's using a seven part book and our
[1:05:12] prophet in these last days took the
[1:05:14] Bible that we'll see what seven seals
[1:05:16] and revealed the mystery of the book and
[1:05:18] open it up so the end time bride can
[1:05:20] know her place in her position it took
[1:05:23] the book to do it
[1:05:24] it took the opening of the book to
[1:05:26] reveal it is that right so we see our
[1:05:29] place in God's plan of redemption so I'm
[1:05:33] just showing you this principle here of
[1:05:35] God's mathematics of revealing his word
[1:05:38] you see that threes and sevens
[1:05:40] now how many remembers how many feasts
[1:05:43] God ordained for Israel to observe seven
[1:05:47] Passover
[1:05:48] right feast of unleavened bread feast
[1:05:51] the firstfruits then Pentecost and
[1:05:53] that's all in the summer time and then
[1:05:55] the last ones like touching on the
[1:05:57] spring and then you come on over to the
[1:05:59] seventh month feasts the trumpets feast
[1:06:02] of atonement then Feast of Tabernacles
[1:06:04] all right all three of the last feasts
[1:06:08] are in the seventh month three and seven
[1:06:11] right so you have this going on and on
[1:06:16] there's Jehovah Jireh CH over rapha
[1:06:18] jehova nissi Jovic alone Joe over on Joe
[1:06:21] over suit canoe G over Shama seven
[1:06:23] compound redemptive names all pointing
[1:06:25] to Jesus Christ but those seven
[1:06:27] Jehovah's are speaking of Lord Jesus
[1:06:28] Christ right so uh it's really fantastic
[1:06:33] this that one statement is what I'm
[1:06:35] trying to share with you because we're
[1:06:37] the branch says your soul spirit and
[1:06:38] body and your life is renewed every
[1:06:41] seven years brother Ram taught us
[1:06:43] there's seven dimensions but there's
[1:06:45] three heavens right so brother Bob has
[1:06:48] been recently ministering on the
[1:06:49] furniture in the tabernacle there's
[1:06:51] seven pieces of furniture
[1:06:53] but there's three courts out of court in
[1:06:55] her court and holy of Holy's right and
[1:06:58] brother Branham taught us that Moses set
[1:07:00] it up that way because it all speaks of
[1:07:02] Christ the furniture speaks of Christ
[1:07:04] the tabernacle speaks of Christ
[1:07:05] everything speaks of Christ what's off
[1:07:08] situated by three and a seven because
[1:07:11] God's mathematics of revealing his word
[1:07:14] it's threes and sevens now bring up Amos
[1:07:16] the scripture I got there brother Amos
[1:07:20] chapter three verse seven it's just like
[1:07:24] you know surely the Lord God will do
[1:07:26] nothing but he revealeth his secret unto
[1:07:29] his servants the prophets Amos 3:7 right
[1:07:33] there
[1:07:34] so God's mathematics of revealing his
[1:07:37] word is threes and sevens you can see
[1:07:39] three and seven all over brother
[1:07:40] branham's life and ministry three poles
[1:07:42] seven seals right not that you
[1:07:46] necessarily need the message to be
[1:07:47] vindicated to you but it sure is fun
[1:07:50] sure is fun to already know you're right
[1:07:53] about what you're right about amen so
[1:07:58] even the seals were formatted there's
[1:08:00] ten sermons preaching seven seals right
[1:08:03] when he preached the church ages he
[1:08:05] preached ten sermons for seven Church
[1:08:08] ages so there's three sermons added to
[1:08:11] the seven churches right in 1960 he
[1:08:13] preached revelation of Jesus Christ in a
[1:08:16] Patmos vision that's just like God high
[1:08:18] in simplicity in the breach then he
[1:08:20] preached the first church age second
[1:08:22] third fourth fifth sixth church age and
[1:08:24] in between the sixth search agents seven
[1:08:26] church age he preached ten virgins in
[1:08:28] hundred forty-four thousand that's
[1:08:30] revelations chapter seven because the
[1:08:34] ten virgins in the hundred forty four
[1:08:35] thousand are revelations chapter seven
[1:08:37] all right so he brother branham even put
[1:08:40] an interval between his sermons just
[1:08:42] like it's formatted in in the scripture
[1:08:45] and here's the seven churches right here
[1:08:48] right there's ten virgins in the seven
[1:08:50] churches it's formatted exactly like the
[1:08:52] seals so it's seven seals which three
[1:08:55] sermons added to it seven Church ages
[1:08:58] with three sermons added to it all right
[1:09:00] threes and sevens Amen eat okay what's
[1:09:04] the point brother Matthew even the way
[1:09:06] he preached the sermon
[1:09:07] the scriptural right even the way
[1:09:11] they're formatted because even the way
[1:09:14] the bots the Bible's broke down chapter
[1:09:16] and verse is inspired people used to
[1:09:19] argue about it come on brother man even
[1:09:21] chapter and verse
[1:09:21] that's why Isaiah 66 chapters represent
[1:09:25] 66 books of the Bible it's all there for
[1:09:29] a reason
[1:09:30] amen I believe it from cover to cover
[1:09:33] chapter verse every line and brother
[1:09:36] Brennan said there's more in between the
[1:09:37] lines and what's on the line and that
[1:09:40] love affair lets you see what's in
[1:09:42] between the lines amen
[1:09:44] so you can just go on and on is this a
[1:09:47] vindicated message Amen threes and
[1:09:50] sevens my friends it's really a
[1:09:53] fantastic reality the seven pieces of
[1:09:56] furniture the seven feast seven
[1:09:58] dimensions in three heavens right and
[1:10:01] the whole Bible just being sealed with
[1:10:03] seven seals and a three-fold mystery the
[1:10:07] revelation of Jesus Christ in these last
[1:10:09] days has been perfectly laid out for an
[1:10:11] endtime bride so that she can recognize
[1:10:14] her place in her position in God's plan
[1:10:16] of redemption all right
[1:10:18] so bring up for me if you don't mind
[1:10:21] Joshua chapter 19 verse 51 in this verse
[1:10:26] right here it's whenever they make an
[1:10:29] end of dividing the land now just
[1:10:32] remember Matthew chapter 24 2015 1
[1:10:35] versus Genesis chapter 24 verse 51 it's
[1:10:39] about a bride being taken out one
[1:10:41] morning brother Dale is waking up and I
[1:10:43] heard his clear is a bell in my heart
[1:10:46] when saints awaken there'll be no faking
[1:10:48] for it's been spoken those with the
[1:10:50] token will be taken because this is an
[1:10:53] age where brother Branham says there
[1:10:54] will just be an absence of people and
[1:10:57] you know it's not to scare you it should
[1:11:00] rejoice the heart of a real believer
[1:11:01] with that man came to brother Branham
[1:11:03] says brother man you scared the people
[1:11:05] talking about to come in the Lord
[1:11:06] brethren said what people not God's
[1:11:10] people to come into the Lord should be
[1:11:12] the greatest rejoiceful thing that you
[1:11:14] can even think about
[1:11:16] that's right the sweet Lord Jesus coming
[1:11:19] to catch you away that's how internet
[1:11:21] you must be with the Lord not like well
[1:11:24] I want to make some more money or I just
[1:11:27] want to see my business grow I want to
[1:11:28] see this I want to see that you want to
[1:11:30] see that more than you want to see Jesus
[1:11:31] you got issues that's true this verse is
[1:11:36] where so they made an end of dividing
[1:11:40] the country does the word of God rightly
[1:11:43] divided is the bride divided from the
[1:11:45] church in these last days this is what
[1:11:47] I'm trying to share with you how the
[1:11:48] bride has been separated out the bride
[1:11:51] has been divided and we've been taught
[1:11:53] how he must rightly divide the word a
[1:11:55] workman that needeth not be ashamed is
[1:11:57] that right rightly dividing the word is
[1:12:00] understanding the distinction between
[1:12:02] bride and church because the bride is
[1:12:06] the living word like Jesus Christ is a
[1:12:08] living word right rightly dividing the
[1:12:11] word so they rightly divided the land
[1:12:15] according to their inheritance so that's
[1:12:18] the type of what's happening these last
[1:12:19] days by the opening the seven seals the
[1:12:21] true Bride of Christ knows her place in
[1:12:23] knows her position as that right brother
[1:12:25] Louise so uh Exodus 12 51 and it came to
[1:12:34] pass the self-same day that the Lord did
[1:12:36] bring the children of Israel out of the
[1:12:38] land Israel was separated from Egypt
[1:12:42] it's just a principle of separation I'm
[1:12:44] sharing with you now okay now go with me
[1:12:48] to Luke chapter 9 Luke chapter 9
[1:12:55] guess what verse 51 all right and it
[1:13:01] came to pass when the time was come that
[1:13:03] he should be received up and it came to
[1:13:07] pass when he should be received up right
[1:13:10] he was parted from our received up he
[1:13:13] steadfastly set his face to go to
[1:13:15] Jerusalem okay now this is an
[1:13:20] interesting thing right here because
[1:13:21] when you read on down through the
[1:13:22] passage they did not actually let him
[1:13:24] come to that village because he sent
[1:13:28] messengers before him there was a two
[1:13:29] sons of thunder John and James and
[1:13:33] whenever they wouldn't receive him he
[1:13:36] said Lord you want us to call fire down
[1:13:38] out of heaven like Elijah did you
[1:13:40] remember that well I want you to notice
[1:13:43] in this verse 51 and it came to pass
[1:13:45] when he should be received up what does
[1:13:47] that mean
[1:13:48] let me take in the glory okay he's got
[1:13:51] to be separated from his disciples okay
[1:13:53] but he sends them into the city of the
[1:13:58] Samaritans it was a village of
[1:14:00] Samaritans but when they found out he
[1:14:02] was going to go to Jerusalem they said
[1:14:04] now I never mind we don't want you to
[1:14:06] come because there are sectarianism
[1:14:08] between Samaritans and Jews remember
[1:14:12] that a conversation Jesus had with the
[1:14:14] woman at the well he said that the that
[1:14:17] we worship God in this mountain because
[1:14:20] of our Father Jacob but did you say in
[1:14:22] Jerusalem is where you ought to worship
[1:14:24] I think that kind of thing still exists
[1:14:26] with people today brother Branham taught
[1:14:29] us the only place God accepts worship is
[1:14:31] in Christ the only place God will meet
[1:14:34] you is in Christ what did Jesus tell her
[1:14:37] you know not what she worshiped but
[1:14:39] salvation is of the Jews for the father
[1:14:41] seeks those that worship Him to worship
[1:14:44] Him in spirit and in truth not in
[1:14:47] Jerusalem nor in this mountain is that
[1:14:50] right so the place of worship was an
[1:14:54] issue with the Samaritans they wouldn't
[1:14:56] even let Jesus come there because he was
[1:14:59] on his way to Jerusalem so because of
[1:15:02] their religiosity they are like now no
[1:15:04] thanks isn't that strange
[1:15:06] so James and John said Lord you wants to
[1:15:10] call fire out of heaven on him and he
[1:15:14] says no the Son of Man didn't come to
[1:15:16] take life but to save but I want you to
[1:15:20] see a correlation now because I'm a
[1:15:22] Bible reader I see verse 51 when it came
[1:15:26] time for him to receive up remember when
[1:15:28] that King fell through the lattice and
[1:15:30] he was sending two men to go inquire of
[1:15:32] a false god Bale elisha met him on the
[1:15:35] road says what you're doing is there not
[1:15:37] a God in Israel
[1:15:38] and he sent them back and him back in
[1:15:40] the blue they went back and told the
[1:15:41] king and the king said what'd he look
[1:15:43] like
[1:15:43] and they described what Elijah look like
[1:15:45] and the King perceived that it was
[1:15:47] Elijah so Elijah sent a captain with his
[1:15:51] fifty everybody how many that is that
[1:15:58] king sent fifty-one men that go car lied
[1:16:00] you off that mountain
[1:16:01] and what did Elijah do call fire down
[1:16:04] out of heaven on 51 men say brother
[1:16:08] manthie what does all that mean it means
[1:16:10] rapture it means separation because
[1:16:13] immediately after he Elijah called that
[1:16:15] fire down he was translated and
[1:16:17] immediately after the third pole third
[1:16:19] Pole finishes up in the bride she'll be
[1:16:21] gone do you understand
[1:16:24] Elijah called fire down on a captain
[1:16:27] with his fifty then he sent a second set
[1:16:29] of men a captain what is fifty then that
[1:16:32] King sent a third group right and then
[1:16:36] the angel of the Lord came to lights
[1:16:37] that Elijah spare these right so 51 51
[1:16:42] 51 and here in luke 9:51 when it came
[1:16:46] time for jesus be caught up you got
[1:16:48] james and john wanting to call fire down
[1:16:50] so there's a correlation and association
[1:16:53] here that i recognize that's really
[1:16:55] profound in my heart because whenever it
[1:16:59] comes time for us to translate and
[1:17:01] everything like this will be that kind
[1:17:04] of ministry like elijah had when he
[1:17:05] called fire down is that right and of
[1:17:08] course that anointing will go be with
[1:17:09] two prophets and they smite smite the
[1:17:11] earth with plagues as often as they will
[1:17:13] but that kind of manifestation is
[1:17:16] associated with translation translation
[1:17:19] grace rapturing faith do you understand
[1:17:23] okay so if you go to the last chapter of
[1:17:26] Luke
[1:17:27] look at verse 51 with me Luke chapter 24
[1:17:31] and verse 51 and it came to pass while
[1:17:36] he blessed them he was parted from them
[1:17:38] right again another verse 51 where he's
[1:17:42] parted from them okay now go with me
[1:17:45] back to Luke because I actually want to
[1:17:46] go back to Luke 12 where I really wanted
[1:17:48] to finish up I'm so sorry for being like
[1:17:50] you know
[1:17:51] buckshot over here I do get scattered
[1:17:53] about all right thanks for your forget
[1:17:58] you and the business of forgiveness all
[1:18:00] right I'm so glad you are let's look at
[1:18:03] verse 54 in Luke 12 okay that's where we
[1:18:09] want to be huh
[1:18:11] now we read that one already we want we
[1:18:15] want verse 54 because that's the five in
[1:18:17] one house did you catch what I was
[1:18:18] saying there how many was in Rebecca's
[1:18:20] house LasR Rebecca bath or Laban and
[1:18:24] Rebecca's mom la zone Rebecca's two and
[1:18:28] those other three they got separated
[1:18:30] because when Eliezer got done with his
[1:18:32] ministry Rebecca was out of there and
[1:18:34] then he led Rebecca to Isaac isn't that
[1:18:38] what the Prophet fulfilled have you been
[1:18:40] in marriage you know what Christ now
[1:18:42] it's you and Jesus that's right but what
[1:18:45] about the Prophet the Prophet fulfilled
[1:18:47] his part everybody here loves brother
[1:18:49] Brandon we're not putting them in a bad
[1:18:51] light but we love Jesus Jesus Christ is
[1:18:55] the one that called us out through
[1:18:56] brother Branham that's right so right
[1:18:59] here it says and he said also to the
[1:19:02] people when you see a cloud rise out of
[1:19:04] the east when you see a cloud rising out
[1:19:08] of the south when you see it clouds rise
[1:19:11] out of the north when you see a cloud
[1:19:14] rise out of what happened out in west
[1:19:17] Arizona sky did a cloud rise huh
[1:19:22] now notice what Jesus is talking about
[1:19:24] in verse 51 think not that I'm come he
[1:19:27] said think not that I am come to bring
[1:19:30] peace but division the cloud appears in
[1:19:34] the West and straightway you say there
[1:19:36] cometh the shower
[1:19:37] what kind of shower did that rain cloud
[1:19:39] that that cloud bring a form of rain is
[1:19:43] that right
[1:19:43] it brought a form of rain let's read a
[1:19:47] little bit more it says here there
[1:19:52] cometh a shower and so it is and when
[1:19:54] you see the south wind blow you say
[1:19:56] there shall be heat and it cometh to
[1:19:58] pass you hypocrites you can discern the
[1:20:02] oh my boy scripture is really something
[1:20:06] with this message ain't it
[1:20:07] you got a cloud rising out of the West
[1:20:10] you got Jesus talking about a face you
[1:20:12] gotta talk about I am come to bring
[1:20:14] division and the bridesman separated
[1:20:18] folks do you see what I'm talking about
[1:20:21] you hypocrites you can discern the face
[1:20:23] of the sky and of the earth but how is
[1:20:26] it that you not discerned this time the
[1:20:29] Lord Jesus was rebuking him for not
[1:20:30] recognizing the vindicated word for the
[1:20:32] hour now everybody recognizes God sent a
[1:20:36] prophet and the Lord took brother Brent
[1:20:37] home in 1965 but what has God been doing
[1:20:40] from 65 to 2019 does it draw a blank or
[1:20:45] do you know what part of the Bible
[1:20:46] you're in do you know what part of the
[1:20:48] scripture you're living in that's the
[1:20:50] thing eternal life is recognized in the
[1:20:52] word made manifest and God interpreting
[1:20:56] the word for your hour now what has been
[1:20:59] what is present truth that right it
[1:21:04] doesn't take much revelation now to say
[1:21:06] God sent a prophet everybody can see
[1:21:09] vindication it don't take half a brain
[1:21:11] to see a vindication but it takes the
[1:21:15] Holy Ghost revelation to see real
[1:21:18] revelation right so do you not
[1:21:22] understand how Jesus rebuked the people
[1:21:24] of his day for not recognizing he was
[1:21:26] actually scripture made manifest what
[1:21:29] about the scriptures now what part of
[1:21:31] the Scriptures being made manifest it's
[1:21:33] revelations 10 8 to 11 because God has
[1:21:36] already vindicated revelations 10 1 2 7
[1:21:38] the Lord Jesus has already descended
[1:21:41] with a shout young people Christ has
[1:21:43] already come forth to call his bride he
[1:21:46] has descended with the shout that's why
[1:21:48] we got what we got Christ's personal
[1:21:50] presence is now leading the bride to the
[1:21:53] marriage supper that's right is that the
[1:21:57] truth so let's just go in a little bit
[1:22:00] here I think we can see some more
[1:22:02] sermons of the Prophet right than these
[1:22:03] passages the face in the sky and of the
[1:22:06] earth but how is it that you not discern
[1:22:08] this time what is this time this is the
[1:22:12] time where the bride's completely
[1:22:13] matured and perfected and then taken
[1:22:16] the marriage supper because I guarantee
[1:22:18] you that there is a 144,000 Israelites
[1:22:21] over there right now yearn and agonizing
[1:22:23] for the fulfillment of what's calling in
[1:22:26] their heart because of deep calls to the
[1:22:28] deep and if there's a deep calling
[1:22:31] there's got to be a deep to respond and
[1:22:32] Christ is going to have to profits
[1:22:35] minister the word in such a way that
[1:22:37] those 144,000 will come out sister and
[1:22:41] they will be distinct they will be
[1:22:42] defined because right now you don't know
[1:22:44] who they are but you if you was here but
[1:22:47] God forbid that she would be here but
[1:22:50] just imagine if you could if God would
[1:22:53] let you look down over the banister of
[1:22:55] heaven and the two prophets are on earth
[1:22:57] ministering you would be able to see who
[1:23:00] the hundred 44,000 are because their
[1:23:02] response to the message would tell on
[1:23:04] them the way they believe it the way
[1:23:07] they take to it the way that it has an
[1:23:09] effect on them because their
[1:23:11] predestinated to it is that the right is
[1:23:15] that right so he says in verse 57 yay
[1:23:18] and why even of your own selves judge he
[1:23:21] even mentions judge
[1:23:23] white wig right even though he says
[1:23:27] judging not what is right when thou
[1:23:29] goest with thine adversary to the
[1:23:31] magistrate as that in the way he moved
[1:23:35] it on me as thou art in the way give
[1:23:38] diligence that doubt he moved it again
[1:23:43] thou may'st be delivered from him lest
[1:23:46] he hail thee to the judge
[1:23:49] yea and the judge deliver thee to the
[1:23:52] officer officer the Prophet brought an
[1:23:56] indictment the judge Jesus Christ the
[1:23:59] white wig right and then what souls that
[1:24:02] are in prison now the Lord Jesus had it
[1:24:07] just right didn't he
[1:24:08] then that Bible is really something when
[1:24:11] you got the message to go with it that
[1:24:14] was wrote nineteen hundred two thousand
[1:24:16] years ago then these last days of cloud
[1:24:18] pears in the West is the white wig Jesus
[1:24:21] Christ has convened court he's got an
[1:24:23] officer on earth to identify what's
[1:24:25] happening in the Bible and then he
[1:24:27] indict the generation for the
[1:24:29] second crucifixion of the Son of man son
[1:24:30] of God right and the church world has
[1:24:33] crucified the Son of God to themselves
[1:24:34] afresh
[1:24:35] they've been indicted because Christ has
[1:24:37] convened Court so there's people in
[1:24:42] prison when you go to Walmart you're
[1:24:44] looking at people that are in prison
[1:24:46] because if they don't know Jesus Christ
[1:24:48] in the power of the Resurrection and are
[1:24:51] illuminated to the present tense reality
[1:24:53] of Christ you cannot be nowhere else but
[1:24:55] in prison you have to be conscious of
[1:24:58] what Christ is doing today the present
[1:25:00] truth and be established in it not only
[1:25:03] has God sent a prophet but what you got
[1:25:05] after that I'm trying to show you
[1:25:08] continuity what has occurred what are
[1:25:11] you conscious enough to walk in the
[1:25:13] reality of what has transpired between
[1:25:15] the Gentile prophet and two Hebrew
[1:25:17] prophets
[1:25:18] it's revelations 10 8 to 11 brother
[1:25:22] Branham is the Gentile prophet Moses and
[1:25:24] Elijah will be two Hebrew prophets but
[1:25:26] their scripture in between their right
[1:25:29] brother Branham taught me to be this way
[1:25:32] everything has to be scriptural
[1:25:34] everything has to be tied to the
[1:25:36] scripture brother Brown I've seen a
[1:25:38] vision I see a vision but I always look
[1:25:40] for it in the Bible
[1:25:41] right so on and on it goes if you got a
[1:25:45] doctrine if you got a revelation you
[1:25:47] better be able to preach it from the
[1:25:48] whole Bible now this is what I'm into I
[1:25:51] like to be able to take it through the
[1:25:53] whole Bible see it all over the place
[1:25:55] amen you you believe that there's an
[1:25:57] endtime Bride here friends we need to
[1:26:00] stop looking at church and just look at
[1:26:02] the promise of God's Word because of
[1:26:05] God's words that our Lord God said that
[1:26:07] there'd be a church here with a sin free
[1:26:08] church without spot without wrinkle
[1:26:11] people who totally overcome themselves
[1:26:13] people that totally overcome carnality
[1:26:16] people that overcome sin death held the
[1:26:18] grave
[1:26:19] Satan's Eden the ecumenical movement
[1:26:21] everything then time bride is so
[1:26:24] inoculated against sin she can't even
[1:26:26] die that's the kind of people we're
[1:26:28] talking about here damn it
[1:26:31] [Applause]
[1:26:34] what's the wages of sin can you
[1:26:38] attribute send to the bride brother
[1:26:41] branch said there's no fault in her the
[1:26:43] end time bride is the omega bride the
[1:26:45] prophecy of the bow says the glory of
[1:26:47] the latter house will be greater than
[1:26:49] the glory of the former those precious
[1:26:51] Saints we're no more elected than they
[1:26:54] are but the difference is this is the
[1:26:55] age God promised to make these things
[1:26:58] vindicated so if they're in that age and
[1:27:03] the Omega bride Saints drifted into
[1:27:06] Ephesus where's this bride gonna go
[1:27:09] she's going to the marriage supper of
[1:27:11] the Lamb because there's no other
[1:27:12] scripture that declares anything else it
[1:27:16] is so helpful to your faith to examine
[1:27:20] the word and see type shadow allegory
[1:27:23] the prophetic revelation of the Bible to
[1:27:26] see exactly how what has all been made
[1:27:28] up to and what you're walking right now
[1:27:30] because God can't change this word what
[1:27:35] did Ephesians what did that word and
[1:27:37] Ecclesiastes say I'd like to read that
[1:27:39] again check this out all that has been
[1:27:42] is right he says that which has been is
[1:27:45] now and that which is have been already
[1:27:50] hath already been right so it's very
[1:27:54] simple young people this is not hard if
[1:27:57] you understand type and shadow listen
[1:28:01] young people listen Isaac you've heard
[1:28:02] brother Graham say and teach that Isaac
[1:28:04] is a perfect type of Christ right well
[1:28:07] whenever Abraham was told by the Lord to
[1:28:09] offer his son Isaac up on a mountain
[1:28:12] that he would show him Abraham packed
[1:28:15] the wood on the back of Isaac and Isaac
[1:28:17] carried the wood up the hill that was
[1:28:19] the Lord Jesus he was betraying Jesus
[1:28:21] carrying the cross up the hill brother
[1:28:24] branham tells us and history tells us
[1:28:26] the very hill that Isaac went up is the
[1:28:29] very hill Jesus was crucified on that's
[1:28:32] not hard folks it's typology it's
[1:28:35] prophetic foreshadowing of a great thing
[1:28:38] God would fulfill if God did that then
[1:28:42] then he brought it to pass in the days
[1:28:44] of G
[1:28:44] he doesn't now the Lord spoke seven
[1:28:47] squirrels into existence through the
[1:28:49] prophets lips then brother Brennan says
[1:28:52] that was God commissioning for me to do
[1:28:55] something that was God's commission to
[1:28:57] me he was commissioned to reveal seven
[1:29:00] thunders seven seal mysteries so
[1:29:03] whenever the seven squirrels were spoken
[1:29:05] into existence that type the seven
[1:29:08] mysteries being spoken because the seven
[1:29:11] squirrel was hit a little bit deeper
[1:29:12] than the other six and the seventh score
[1:29:16] was underneath a piece of bark and a
[1:29:18] leaf the bark represents the doctrine of
[1:29:21] holiness the Wesleyan age and the leaf
[1:29:23] represents the Pentecostal age then
[1:29:25] after that comes the meat of the word
[1:29:28] are you eating that meat are you feeding
[1:29:31] on that and brother Branham said
[1:29:32] immediately after the seven squirrels
[1:29:35] had II was told to speak and what does
[1:29:38] the woman represent church bride had he
[1:29:42] represents the bride being brought into
[1:29:44] speaking conditions after the seven
[1:29:45] church age messenger speaks seven
[1:29:47] mysteries then you got a bride that's
[1:29:52] the way it's been patterned in the Bible
[1:29:53] right so all that has been is now right
[1:29:59] and all that hath already been right or
[1:30:03] and that which is to be hath already
[1:30:07] been even everything that you have right
[1:30:10] now in your present hour you can see it
[1:30:12] back in the Bible everything's been
[1:30:14] foreshadowed right three kinds of
[1:30:17] believers all three of those kinds of
[1:30:19] believers have been foreshadowed in the
[1:30:20] Bible amen so I just want to encourage
[1:30:24] you to seek the Lord for a clear
[1:30:27] understanding of your present hour
[1:30:29] because you know what's happened to a
[1:30:31] lot of people their faith stopped in
[1:30:33] 1965 they have not went on they're
[1:30:37] scared to death to read the next verse
[1:30:40] after revelations 10 7 John represents
[1:30:43] the bride the bride supposed to take the
[1:30:46] seven sealed open book and eat it and
[1:30:48] then become the final voice to the final
[1:30:51] age that's exactly what brother Brown
[1:30:53] said in the church age book he said the
[1:30:55] voice of God will be in her
[1:30:58] that's right whoo-hoo I wonder if I
[1:31:02] should read this quote hmm there is a
[1:31:08] statement in the church age book where
[1:31:10] brother Bram said this image would try
[1:31:12] to stop the bride from teaching and
[1:31:14] preaching right now we know not
[1:31:17] everybody's qualified to preach brother
[1:31:20] Brenner said if you ain't met that
[1:31:21] pillar of fire face to face you ain't
[1:31:23] got no business in the pulpit if you
[1:31:25] don't know Jesus Christ and a poverty
[1:31:27] rich and what are you doing handling the
[1:31:29] word but you know what happens people
[1:31:31] get enthused because they hear a
[1:31:34] vindicated prophet preach and they get
[1:31:36] all excited and they think they can take
[1:31:37] a pulpit that's way too many people
[1:31:40] we've already seen people be raised in
[1:31:42] the message pastor a church and then
[1:31:45] claim the cloud was by for missile from
[1:31:48] the US Army how in the world that man
[1:31:50] getting a pulpit where's the discernment
[1:31:52] when brother BAM caller similarly
[1:31:54] apostles discern their preachers they
[1:31:56] discern their apostles you know what the
[1:32:00] problem is I just flat-out sitting and
[1:32:01] I'm gonna get out of this pulpit the
[1:32:04] people with the genuine Holy Ghost are
[1:32:06] far and few between the really let is
[1:32:10] fear not little flock so we have to kind
[1:32:16] of just walk in love amen walk in love
[1:32:20] well friends I hope that I have whetted
[1:32:22] your appetite to study to dig to really
[1:32:26] take the prophets message back to the
[1:32:28] Bible meditate in Scripture amen
[1:32:31] revelation is for young people this for
[1:32:34] old people it's for middle-aged people
[1:32:35] because it's the Holy Spirit that
[1:32:37] imparts it amen so god bless your
[1:32:41] precious hearts amen you love the Lord
[1:32:43] give him praise
[1:32:51] well thank you so much I know sometimes
[1:32:54] we just kind of rush in town you know
[1:32:56] we're kind of limited and I feel a
[1:32:57] little strained you know probably not as
[1:32:59] relaxed as I should be and I apologize
[1:33:02] for that but uh it's my fault yeah but
[1:33:06] it's just you know we got a run back to
[1:33:09] mobile and get back into the saddle
[1:33:11] there and everything but it's been a
[1:33:12] wonderful privilege to be with you
[1:33:14] always an honor to fellowship with my
[1:33:16] precious elder brother our pastor here
[1:33:17] and God bless brother Wade I appreciate
[1:33:20] him coming down and sharing the love of
[1:33:21] Christ with us in mobile and and Hillman

[1:33:39] brother Lewis god bless him in his
[1:33:42] ministry and brother Aaron Roberts
[1:33:44] brother Bob I believe they're going down
[1:33:46] to Jacksonville Florida amen god bless
[1:33:49] them people there there is children of
[1:33:51] God scattered everywhere and we should
[1:33:54] pray for the bride because she has to
[1:33:56] come to that place of absolute maturity
[1:33:58] and don't never get caught up in
[1:34:00] sectarianism and churchianity and this
[1:34:03] group and that group and the groups
[1:34:05] because it's an individual affair always
[1:34:09] remember that friend it's an individual
[1:34:12] fare you are an individual before God
[1:34:14] it's your responsibility I don't mean to
[1:34:18] keep on but somebody literally look me
[1:34:20] in the face and told me I would be a
[1:34:22] Christian if it wasn't for my husband
[1:34:24] he's so mean how in the world you gonna
[1:34:29] say that before God on the day of
[1:34:30] judgment I can't be a Christian because
[1:34:33] of my husband huh
[1:34:38] that doesn't that's not gonna work
[1:34:39] friend you you can't blame somebody else
[1:34:42] for you not being a Christian it doesn't
[1:34:45] work I'd be a Christian if it wasn't for
[1:34:48] that mean old church up there that
[1:34:51] doesn't work the Christian is an
[1:34:55] ordained affair anyway God calls you to
[1:34:58] be a Christian
[1:34:59] do you think somebody some other mortal
[1:35:01] can cancel out your election no chance
[1:35:05] no way you think God works his business
[1:35:09] like some haphazard thing he hopes he
[1:35:11] could save you in the end God's really
[1:35:13] just trying really hard hoping that
[1:35:16] you'll just cross that finish line
[1:35:18] you know the truth friend if you cross
[1:35:22] that finish line at all you cross before
[1:35:23] the foundation of the world God God's
[1:35:26] already got it fixed up all you got to
[1:35:28] do is walk with him
[1:35:30] Enoch walked with God and he was found
[1:35:33] not brother Brennan was in the Coronado
[1:35:36] forest and God says why don't you walk
[1:35:37] with me for a while and when he was
[1:35:40] walking with God he felt his hair come
[1:35:42] back he felt younger than me that would
[1:35:44] grab his Army's walkaway meter in the
[1:35:46] wilderness he was turned back young and
[1:35:48] what was he doing walking with God
[1:35:51] walking with God that's what you got to
[1:35:55] go friend personal intimate reality not
[1:36:01] you and your spouse and your kids and
[1:36:04] your church and your neighborhood just
[1:36:06] you I'm sorry I have to say it that
[1:36:08] blunt for people to get it you and Jesus
[1:36:11] that's all but but I want my wife to go
[1:36:14] on the rapture that's between her and
[1:36:16] Jesus Jesus is the one taking her
[1:36:18] rapture not you her association with you
[1:36:21] does not put her in a rapture get that
[1:36:23] straight your association would have
[1:36:25] pastor your association with a church
[1:36:26] you can love brother branham and miss
[1:36:29] the rapture you have to know Jesus
[1:36:32] Christ and the power of his resurrection
[1:36:34] okay let me say it like this who is it
[1:36:37] that gives the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:36:40] only Jesus Christ so who do you got to
[1:36:43] talk to to get the baptism of the Holy
[1:36:45] Ghost that's right
[1:36:48] asking it shall be given is what the
[1:36:50] Bible says if you then being evil know
[1:36:53] how to give good gifts to your children
[1:36:54] how much more will your heavenly Father
[1:36:56] give the Holy Spirit to them that ask
[1:36:59] him ask him why do people always try to
[1:37:04] qualify their Christianity of other
[1:37:06] people what do you get out of other
[1:37:08] people believe in you're a Christian
[1:37:11] you want God to recognize your Christian
[1:37:13] and then God will give you the honor and
[1:37:17] the notoriety from heaven that's what
[1:37:20] you should be seeking for not to be
[1:37:23] noticed by other flesh-and-blood people
[1:37:25] you can live a life of faith and be
[1:37:28] noticed by heaven that's what the angel
[1:37:31] told Daniel Daniel since the day you
[1:37:33] started praying we started making our
[1:37:36] way to you Daniel you're greatly beloved
[1:37:39] from up there that's the way you want to
[1:37:42] be friends because all that live godly
[1:37:45] in christ will suffer persecution and
[1:37:49] then they added a scripture but most
[1:37:51] likely they will suffer persecution by
[1:37:53] other people who professed to be living
[1:37:55] with christ huh but that's the way it is
[1:38:00] so do you understand did I know I shared
[1:38:03] a lot of technical things with you but
[1:38:05] it's really profound the way the message
[1:38:07] is opened the Bible and we see a bride
[1:38:11] going into the marriage supper
[1:38:15] we see it all pattern out for us and
[1:38:18] shout voice Trump the Lord Jesus
[1:38:21] descends from heaven and he has been
[1:38:24] here on the earth and word form in the
[1:38:26] form of the Holy Ghost anointing and
[1:38:28] endtime bride moving in individuals
[1:38:32] people are clamoring for a move of God
[1:38:35] they want to see a revival and their
[1:38:37] prophet told them all kinds of ways he
[1:38:39] could revival is over there is no more
[1:38:43] moves don't look for no big thing now
[1:38:47] it's just gonna be an absence of people
[1:38:50] that's right I'm sorry but that's the
[1:38:52] way it is did you know brother Branham
[1:38:55] taught after God discerned Sarah's heart
[1:38:59] in the tenth then their bodies turn back
[1:39:01] young again that's how you get between
[1:39:04] the the prophets gift of discernment and
[1:39:07] then the body change that's it what
[1:39:12] you've been looking for a worldwide
[1:39:15] revival you're looking for the United
[1:39:18] States to have a revival
[1:39:20] the church worlds have an ecumenical
[1:39:22] revival you want to hook up with that
[1:39:25] God have mercy there's no other revival
[1:39:29] but the only revival you can have in
[1:39:31] your soul with Jesus you and Jesus
[1:39:34] you're supposed to be able to pray
[1:39:35] through and enter into the presence of
[1:39:37] God brother Branham says I get alone and
[1:39:39] I can hold my mind with a power in
[1:39:41] prayer that reaches beyond the Moon the
[1:39:44] Stars that gets ahold of God somewhere
[1:39:45] that's why every single one of you
[1:39:47] supposed to be to be able to get ahold
[1:39:49] of God that's right let me get out of
[1:39:52] this pulpit for you don't god bless you
[1:39:55] all so much we love the Lord Jesus amen
