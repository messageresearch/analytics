[26:58] Angie Brown that calls us all the time
[27:01] and she wants us to pray she called one
[27:05] time or called a couple of times and the
[27:06] Lord just answered her prayers right off
[27:09] well so now every time she needs
[27:11] anything she calls which is good you
[27:12] know I'm glad of it and I'm just saying
[27:14] she has the confidence in that but she
[27:16] wants us to pray now that her husband

[27:22] closer which she named the the the place
[27:25] but get closer to where that she be able
[27:28] to to go to church and maybe can get him

[27:46] out from downstairs you know cuz you can
[27:50] have to wait until everything over and

[28:07] over you know and get a bite of cake if
[28:09] we're real good and keep everything out
[28:11] of the the way so just remember that
[28:14] amen any other announcements I generally
[28:16] forget I know Wade will be traveling

[28:21] to go pick him up and everything to to
[28:23] bring him back in so pray that the Lord
[28:25] would would give him a safe journey amen
[28:28] so let's go to
[28:30] Revelations
[28:33] 20 and we'll read verse 11 and 12 then
[28:37] we'll go to Revelations 2 and then we'll
[28:39] go to 2 Corinthians cuz this is just
[28:42] kind of a something I'm wanting to tie
[28:44] in with the morning's message a little
[28:46] and move on verse
[28:49] 11 and I saw a great white throne and
[28:53] him that sat on it from whom face the
[28:56] earth and the heaven fled away and there
[28:58] was found no place for them and I saw
[29:01] the dead small and great stand before
[29:05] God and the books the notice books were
[29:09] open and another book was open which is
[29:12] The Book of Life and the dead was judged
[29:14] out of those things which were written
[29:16] in the books according to their works
[29:20] now we'll go
[29:21] to
[29:26] Revelations
[29:30] verse chapter three I think I wrote down
[29:32] two but three he's got it right up there
[29:35] I gave it to them but I had it on my
[29:36] notes chapter 2 but we'll go to that
[29:40] verse
[29:41] 5 he that overcometh the thing same
[29:44] shall be clothed in white rment and I
[29:46] will not blot out his name out of the
[29:48] book of life and I will confess his name
[29:50] before my father and before his angels
[29:53] all right let's go to the last one which
[29:56] is in
[29:58] second Corinthians I hope we get this
[30:01] far verse or chapter
[30:03] 3 Do We Begin Again to commend ourselves
[30:07] or need we as some others Epistles of
[30:11] commendation to you or letters of off
[30:13] Commendation from you ye are written
[30:16] Epistles in our hearts known and read of
[30:18] all men for as much as you are
[30:21] manifestly declared to be the Epistle of
[30:23] Christ ministered by US Written not with
[30:26] ink but with the spirit of the Living
[30:28] God not in tables of stone but in
[30:31] fleshly tables of the heart you may be
[30:34] seated the Lord add his Blessing to the
[30:37] reading of the
[30:40] word now I
[30:42] didn't finish up the message this
[30:44] morning and all but uh I just pray that
[30:50] you will go back and study it a little
[30:51] bit because the psalmist or the the
[30:54] writer job he was asking the question
[30:57] what is
[30:59] man and I hope that you know that maybe
[31:02] we brought out a few things to be able
[31:05] to understand because you'll find a lot
[31:08] if you go back in the Old Testament and
[31:10] study it you'll find a lot talking about
[31:12] the soul you know an individual a person
[31:17] and a being and like I said David would
[31:19] cry out you know my soul thirsteth after
[31:23] thee CU it was it's you know the soul of
[31:26] man is the part that God made us to
[31:29] where that we would long after him
[31:33] wouldn't be like the animals because
[31:35] they're in the the natural realm of a
[31:38] flesh and things and they're in kind of
[31:40] a spiritual realm as you'd want to maybe
[31:42] say a life real that they live in but
[31:45] they don't have a soul and he made that
[31:48] soul to where it would thirst after him
[31:51] and and that's the thing that I wanted
[31:53] us to see because that's what he's
[31:55] dealing with he's dealing with your soul
[31:58] right all right then we we look at
[32:00] Christians as to try to work upon the
[32:03] flesh well that's fine for the Christian
[32:05] to work upon the flesh but it's not
[32:07] right for us to uh look at a person and
[32:11] judge them by flesh we need to judge
[32:15] them by the desire of their heart all
[32:17] right now if the flesh doesn't line up
[32:20] with the desire of the heart then we
[32:21] know for sure that there's no wrong
[32:24] desire I mean that's sensible that
[32:26] doesn't need interpretation but I just
[32:28] want you to to see that that the Bible
[32:32] spoke of the soul of
[32:34] man and how important that is you know
[32:38] for doing you'll find in Exodus 30 there
[32:40] about
[32:41] 12-16 let's just read that I I wanted to
[32:44] get to that scripture but I didn't get
[32:46] that far we'll get back to our message
[32:48] let's go to
[32:49] Exodus and I just like to read this
[32:56] one
[32:58] because you you find a lot is said about
[33:00] the soul all right look at Exodus I
[33:03] didn't give this to the brothers so if
[33:06] they don't get it up in time that's fine
[33:08] Exodus
[33:09] 30:2 says when thou takest the sum of
[33:12] the children of Israel after their
[33:13] number then shall they give Every Man a
[33:16] ransom for his soul unto the Lord now
[33:20] payment for each
[33:23] person that's how important the soul of
[33:25] man is
[33:27] it didn't even list and we know Soul
[33:29] means being a person all right but it
[33:32] didn't just say the
[33:33] body it was speaking of the Soul he gave
[33:36] it to to ransom for his soul unto the
[33:38] Lord when thouest them that there be no
[33:41] plague among them when thouest them this
[33:45] they shall give everyone that passes
[33:48] among them that are numbered half a
[33:50] shickle after the shle of the sanctuary
[33:53] a shle is 20 gas and high shle shall be
[33:57] the offering of the Lord everyone that
[34:01] passes among them that are numbered from
[34:04] 20 years old and up and above shall give
[34:06] an offering unto the Lord now watch this
[34:10] this is what I wanted to get to the rich
[34:12] shall not give more and the poor shall
[34:15] not give less than a high
[34:18] shle when they give an offering unto the
[34:21] Lord to make an atonement for their
[34:25] souls rich don't give no different than
[34:27] the poor that's what I was wanting to
[34:30] get to this morning but you know didn't
[34:32] have the time time run out on me but
[34:34] just think about it that a soul is so
[34:36] important until it was actually
[34:40] commanded of them to give a certain
[34:43] amount of money was given and that was
[34:46] for each person and if it wasn't given
[34:50] it said then the plagues and the things
[34:52] would come you know and all like that so
[34:54] they wanted everybody to do it it was 20
[34:56] years of age upward but the rich don't
[34:58] give no more than the poor now that's uh
[35:02] you know that's kind of contrary to
[35:04] today's language cuz today the poor is
[35:06] one paying and the rich is not having
[35:09] much to do you know but that don't have
[35:11] anything to do with salvation all right
[35:14] but see I just wanted to get you to
[35:16] think about how important your soul is
[35:20] that God would actually give his own
[35:25] life
[35:27] rich or poor then make no
[35:30] difference doesn't matter whether we
[35:32] have money or don't have money whatever
[35:35] CU it's come by of
[35:37] me and we don't have to have no price
[35:41] that's right the price has already been
[35:43] paid see I wanted to get down to that
[35:45] but now see what we've done we've we've
[35:47] come down out of
[35:49] Heaven coming down to earth and we just
[35:53] picked up a couple of messages and what
[35:56] I'm trying to do do is get up to the
[35:57] time of of the Life of Christ and all in
[36:01] the doing and when he paid the price and
[36:03] all and maybe we'll get to that the Lord
[36:05] willing Wednesday
[36:07] but what I want you to think
[36:10] about this
[36:12] afternoon is The Book of
[36:15] Life now we read there in Revelations
[36:17] and you also find the same thing in
[36:20] Daniel that when you come to the
[36:22] Judgment there the white Throne judgment
[36:25] that there's books
[36:28] books not just one book it's books all
[36:32] right now but to make sure we keep it
[36:36] correctly we'll get to that in a minute
[36:37] and you'll see that it's all one
[36:41] book but it's many
[36:44] sections all right and if you want to
[36:47] study something on it you get a chance
[36:48] to read something if you would just turn
[36:51] in the church age book sometime and
[36:53] start reading at about page somewhere
[36:55] around 264 4 265 right in there and read
[36:59] on over through
[37:01] 286 I think as the light work comes down
[37:04] and just read that and you'll see a lot
[37:07] about names and how the names are are
[37:10] written and how they're removed and and
[37:13] the things that the prophet has covered
[37:15] it but I want you to think about this
[37:18] afternoon the book of life now I'm
[37:21] talking about the
[37:23] section of the book of life that is
[37:26] really just a natural things the brother
[37:29] Ram in I didn't bring this one but in
[37:31] that one where he calls it books he said
[37:34] now life is important to God and said he
[37:37] he records it said not that he has
[37:41] to he because he's omnicient on all of
[37:44] that he doesn't have to record but yet
[37:48] he
[37:49] does he records things now the Bible is
[37:54] the record of man Now list list is what
[37:56] I'm saying because you will say no it's
[37:59] the record of Christ all right that's
[38:00] right
[38:01] now that's the Eternal
[38:05] section but the
[38:07] Bible
[38:09] is a record of
[38:12] life you can take the Bible and you can
[38:14] read it you can find out so and so we
[38:16] got so and so and so and so but got so
[38:18] and so and it just goes on and on and it
[38:21] tells all of the
[38:23] things now brother randam said it like
[38:26] this
[38:27] he said Arman Neville may not be written
[38:30] in the Bible you know the name he said
[38:33] but it's written in there on what was
[38:36] taking place upon the Earth during the
[38:40] time of Arman Neville he said thereby
[38:43] then Arman Neville's name is in the
[38:48] Bible so now I want you to think about
[38:51] the writing of the
[38:52] Bible now I know I know the scriptures
[38:56] and go over Revelations you can get it
[38:58] pick it
[38:59] up the the Bible as far as the the
[39:03] writing of it it was written before the
[39:06] foundation of the world all right right
[39:09] cuz that was the lamb slain and all like
[39:11] that but I also want you to think about
[39:14] that for God to be able to be just and
[39:18] and uh where that nobody can't argue
[39:21] with you with him about anything and and
[39:24] it's not the fact that we do it but
[39:25] we're we're dumb enough as humans to try
[39:29] because even it says that when they come
[39:32] to Earth they'll say have not I done
[39:34] this have not I done that and he says
[39:37] depart from me I never knew you see
[39:39] there'll be people that'll be excuse me
[39:41] dumb enough to argue with God about life
[39:45] so he just records
[39:47] it then see he's this
[39:50] way and you read in the Bible and you
[39:52] find out how it
[39:54] started you find out all all of the
[39:57] things and the the prophet would call
[39:59] the Believers in the
[40:00] book all right but you know there's a
[40:03] lot in the Bible that's just natural
[40:07] writing like I said you go in there and
[40:09] you can find a genealogy so and so we
[40:11] got so and so so and so got so and so
[40:13] it's just a natural writing you can find
[40:16] a lot of things that it'll speak about
[40:19] Pharaoh it'll speak about Egypt it'll
[40:22] speak about uh those kings and the
[40:25] different things you know because it's a
[40:28] record written down that's contained
[40:31] within this one book that we call the
[40:33] Bible CU to me now this is The Book of
[40:36] Life right all right but it's also the
[40:41] Eternal book right it's the book of the
[40:44] lamb slain before the foundation of the
[40:46] world which is a record of eternal life
[40:48] amen all in one book no way in the world
[40:51] could a theologian of any kind and
[40:53] that's why I ask you because I don't
[40:55] want to get into that to preach on it
[40:57] we've done it before
[40:59] but brother random being what he was a
[41:03] prophet read that in the church age book
[41:05] he could tell you what each thing was
[41:07] and there's four different groups there
[41:08] to be covered in it and as he's covering
[41:11] it he said this is all one wheat
[41:16] plant well see we would try to make it a
[41:19] false Vine you
[41:22] know false looking outfit over here and
[41:25] a true seed over
[41:27] here but he said it's all one
[41:33] Vine it's all one thing and he can cover
[41:37] the whole plan of life and
[41:40] doings of
[41:42] speaking and talking about one wheat
[41:46] plant cuz you see when that wheat is
[41:48] planted and it comes up and you can't do
[41:50] away with that
[41:52] stalk you got to wait and that stalk
[41:55] stays but one day that stock could be
[41:57] burned right it's
[41:59] destroyed so then it's the record of it
[42:01] so if you will read that and you'll get
[42:03] more about what I'm trying to talk about
[42:06] but I want to talk to you about the
[42:07] writing of the
[42:09] Bible all right and see in that then
[42:13] you'll see that as it's
[42:16] written that it's a
[42:21] record your life is recorded in the book
[42:25] your name is may not be
[42:27] there but we're living in the age when
[42:30] we can read about lady OA we can read
[42:33] about the things that take place you
[42:35] know that puts our name right in the
[42:38] book but see God then he he does
[42:41] everything so
[42:43] perfectly until what he does he just
[42:46] lets mankind write a
[42:49] book called a
[42:51] Bible and in that Bible is the record of
[42:57] everything that we need but it's a
[43:00] record of the soul of
[43:03] man that was what I was getting at this
[43:07] morning then you'll find that there's a
[43:09] ratom as we
[43:12] read for that soul of that
[43:15] individual if that individual pays the
[43:18] price all right you said but now wait a
[43:22] minute you said a minute ago we have to
[43:23] pay no price all right we don't have to
[43:26] but there was a time you had to right
[43:29] that's the connection between the two
[43:31] Services all right there was a time you
[43:34] had to pay the
[43:37] price cuz that was in the Old Testament
[43:40] that was before the blood of Jesus
[43:42] Christ you had to pay the price right
[43:45] you had to make the sacrifice you had to
[43:49] do the things what was in the Bible
[43:52] written you had to do it amen you
[43:56] understand me see when you come to the
[43:59] New Testament now he done
[44:01] it but just keep the difference because
[44:05] the Old and New Testament is the Bible
[44:07] right it's the two wings of the eagle
[44:10] because if you don't eat away with
[44:11] either one of them you mess up right so
[44:14] then in the writing of the book now just
[44:17] keep that in mind as we're we're trying
[44:18] to go along we want to see how the book
[44:20] of
[44:21] life now remember I'm saying Book of
[44:25] Life
[44:26] God I want you to stay with me not in
[44:30] this going up into a spiritual realm I
[44:33] want you to stay with me in the natural
[44:37] writing see later then we can pick up
[44:39] the spiritual part and we can see the
[44:42] Christ as it comes down through there
[44:44] and it's there in the Old Testament but
[44:46] I want you to just look at the writing
[44:48] and watch how
[44:52] perfect how perfect God keeps a record
[44:57] as I said one ago he don't have
[44:59] to because it to White thr judgment as
[45:02] we read for using as a
[45:05] thought all he's got to do is just click
[45:08] and he can bring back the whole
[45:10] scene of our entire life
[45:13] right but yet he doesn't have to do
[45:17] that CU
[45:19] remember it gets down to a point
[45:23] that the man that came up you know
[45:27] he said well is your name
[45:29] written and if it wasn't written then
[45:31] you get cast out see and come find out
[45:33] his name wasn't written that's right all
[45:36] right so let's find ourselves yes now
[45:40] get my get my whole this is the whole
[45:42] point all right this is the whole point
[45:44] of the
[45:46] sermon if we can see how perfectly in
[45:49] order that God keeps everything and does
[45:53] everything and then we can see our El
[45:56] right
[45:58] there well brother I want to be in the
[46:01] New Testament all
[46:04] right but I I want us to look at our
[46:08] lives and think about your life and how
[46:12] you've been and what you've been as we
[46:14] go through the Old Testament part and
[46:18] compare some of the lives in a
[46:22] minute and see
[46:24] ourselves
[46:26] and see and look at
[46:28] ourselves as the writing of The Book of
[46:32] Life are you following me my point yes I
[46:36] want you to stay with me and not run up
[46:38] so spiritual you know and I don't mean
[46:40] that wrong now but see a lot of times
[46:43] when you preach in natural people
[46:46] believe they'll get over on the
[46:48] spiritual
[46:50] well natural spiritual don't always run
[46:53] totally together so you you you fall off
[46:56] of the point so let's get to Natural
[46:58] then we get to spiritual when we decide
[47:01] to change to the spiritual then we'll
[47:03] announce the spiritual cuz surely second
[47:05] Corinthians is getting over to the
[47:07] written Epistles all right but let's get
[47:10] this this natural and you look at it you
[47:13] can see the
[47:14] individual the soul of
[47:16] mankind and what was happening down
[47:19] through the Old Testament
[47:21] time to come out to see the writing of
[47:24] the Bible all right
[47:26] now so as I said we know for certain
[47:31] now that we can look at the lounge Book
[47:33] of Life and know when it was written but
[47:36] let's look at when it was actually
[47:38] written as far as natural concerned so
[47:41] Brothers go ahead and pull up
[47:42] number number
[47:45] one and just listen to your Prophet as
[47:48] he says these things this is taken from
[47:51] the invisible Union of the bride of
[47:52] Christ preached 1965 11
[47:58] 25 paragraph
[48:00] 308 there is your name on The Book of
[48:05] Life all
[48:07] right The Book of Life is the word of
[48:11] God because the word is God and God is
[48:15] the only thing that is life so your name
[48:19] was represented in the
[48:22] Bible before the Bible became on
[48:26] word all
[48:28] right now so what is what are we looking
[48:31] at the book of
[48:32] life it's the word of God what is the
[48:35] word of God the Bible right this is the
[48:38] word of God all right now watch their
[48:41] names and what the names is is coming
[48:44] down and you'll get my point to see that
[48:49] we've got to look at the natural part so
[48:52] I can
[48:53] read here's what everybody wants to do
[48:55] now and I I like it too I like to read
[48:58] about David killing
[49:01] Goliath I like to be related to that
[49:04] don't you right all right but you know I
[49:09] I've also got to be related to his
[49:11] Natural Life Y and that's why I know for
[49:15] a
[49:16] certainty this is The Book of Life this
[49:19] is the Bible that we're talking about
[49:22] because like brother Rand said about
[49:24] when he would talk about Abraham lying
[49:26] and giv his wife away and all these
[49:28] things he said do you
[49:30] think that as strict and straight as
[49:33] those Jews are that they would write
[49:36] that
[49:39] down you know make a
[49:41] record of Abraham and the things he done
[49:44] of David and the things he done and all
[49:46] the
[49:47] things it proves that the Bible was
[49:49] written by God alone right you're
[49:52] listening cuz how would they admit about
[49:55] the thing things Abraham done when he's
[49:57] the father of the faith even their
[49:59] father the Abraham of the Jews they
[50:02] wouldn't admit
[50:04] that they kind of slide it around like
[50:06] cover up today you know well he wasn't
[50:08] quite as guilty as you think you he was
[50:11] this way or well all of us is kind of
[50:14] little guilty so who can condemn who for
[50:16] what you
[50:18] know see we try to change things but no
[50:21] God just wrote it down
[50:24] amen look father of our faith as we call
[50:27] him God wrote down that he lied and give
[50:31] his wife away right
[50:33] amen he made a
[50:35] record all right when it comes to
[50:41] judgment Abraham won't have to be judged
[50:44] that's right but you know what God can
[50:47] take what Abraham was as he was doing
[50:49] that and all those people have to be
[50:54] judged that's that's what I want you to
[50:56] get see then I want us to relate
[50:58] ourselves back
[51:03] there because we're no different right
[51:07] the Bible said Elijah was a man of what
[51:10] like passion as we
[51:13] are the great Prophet
[51:15] Elijah but yet he was just a human being
[51:18] that's right he's a mortal being just
[51:20] like me and you he wasn't know
[51:23] Supernatural great thing
[51:26] even
[51:28] Samson I was looking at Josiah had a
[51:30] thing down her today and I think it had
[51:32] Samson on it but had great big muscles
[51:34] and that but you know what he was just a
[51:35] little bitty Ruddy
[51:37] guy that was the amazing
[51:39] part he wouldn't no big Arnold Scher
[51:44] ever how you say his name you know I
[51:46] can't never get all that right but he
[51:49] was just little Ruddy guy little small
[51:54] f
[51:56] but when God came on
[51:58] him made a lot of
[52:01] difference he done a lot of natural
[52:03] things that was
[52:05] bad cuz that was his
[52:07] life but yet there was some good things
[52:10] wrote about him too right right so
[52:12] that's the way I want me and you to be
[52:14] go ahead and get to the next one let's
[52:15] get a little reading done and then we'll
[52:16] get back to her
[52:18] thought this is from the invisible Union
[52:21] the same message but it's paragraph 214
[52:24] it says watch
[52:26] your name of your first
[52:28] nature was born and put in a Book of
[52:34] Life all your Deeds was wrote in it
[52:39] everything you done under that nature
[52:42] was put in a
[52:43] book called The Book of
[52:46] Life now think about
[52:48] it you notice in Daniel when he come to
[52:51] the ancient of the days whose hair was
[52:53] white as as wool 10,000 time 10,000s
[52:57] came with him to minister to him the the
[53:00] the bride then the books were open and
[53:03] another book was open which was The Book
[53:05] of Life see there is Saints already
[53:08] there the church to bride another book
[53:11] was open which was the book of life now
[53:14] the bride is sitting there she's the
[53:15] lamb Book of Life
[53:18] right you see what I'm getting at she's
[53:21] a Lamb's Book of Life she's the Eternal
[53:24] section she's sitting on the throne with
[53:27] him all right but there's books is going
[53:30] to
[53:32] appear this
[53:36] book this book right here has enough in
[53:40] it to
[53:43] condemn or to
[53:46] justify every
[53:48] person that is in the world or ever has
[53:51] been or ever will be all right so that's
[53:54] the point I want you to to what you're
[53:55] looking
[53:57] at cuz watch what the prophet comes down
[53:59] to go ahead in number three which is not
[54:03] communion 19651 1212 paragraph 44 like
[54:07] in the book here and the spot there we
[54:10] was talking
[54:12] about the two books being
[54:15] one The Book of Life The First Book of
[54:18] Life coming up was when you were born
[54:22] that was your natural birth see but then
[54:25] one time way back down in DIY he goes on
[54:28] down to that grain all right but I want
[54:30] you to get this other one look at CU
[54:32] this is where I'm talking about it comes
[54:33] from look at number
[54:35] 3A which is Page 283 of the church age
[54:38] books sard in church age Church age book
[54:42] and then the record cuz this is what
[54:43] he's saying
[54:44] here he says the two books being one we
[54:49] just read he said the two books being
[54:50] one now what is it is it two
[54:54] books or what is
[54:57] it so then then the record of this wheat
[54:59] plant whose end is to reproduce The
[55:01] Original Seed is in multiplied form is
[55:04] The Book of Life I repeat the history or
[55:07] record of this wheat plant is in the
[55:10] Book of Life of which a part of the book
[55:12] of life is the record of eternal life a
[55:17] section of the book of life I remember a
[55:20] brother years ago me and he we were
[55:22] talking about this and he said he he I
[55:25] talking about the book and he was
[55:27] talking about he
[55:28] said brother it's two
[55:31] sections cuz he was a scholar on reading
[55:34] the church age book I won't call his
[55:36] name but I I don't I'm saying that in
[55:39] honor that he really knew that book and
[55:42] he said brother Dale it's two
[55:44] sections I said well I know the prophet
[55:46] said it's two books he said yeah but
[55:49] it's two sections if you go read the
[55:50] church a book you'll find it out well I
[55:52] went and read the church a book you know
[55:55] and I found out there's two
[55:56] sections that's what I'm trying to get
[55:58] you to see this Bible has two
[56:01] sections it is the natural life of
[56:04] mankind right it is a record of mankind
[56:08] it will be at the white Throne
[56:11] judgment to be there as a record all
[56:15] right but'll also be sitting on the
[56:18] throne that's the Eternal section but
[56:21] get the two section now get then what I
[56:23] want you to get is the writing of the
[56:24] book
[56:26] see then to look down through there and
[56:29] you'll see why God done the way he
[56:33] done he would take even like
[56:36] Abraham and he would lay a
[56:38] background and show the things you know
[56:41] that took
[56:45] place all
[56:47] right let's just go get in your get your
[56:49] Bible and let's go cuz I didn't give
[56:51] these to the brother to pull up but
[56:53] let's just read a little bit in the
[56:54] Bible
[56:57] but what I want you to
[56:59] see is the writing of the
[57:02] book and find
[57:04] ourselves in the natural
[57:08] writing we won't get to it this
[57:10] afternoon but if you'll read invisible
[57:11] Union of the bride of Christ I give you
[57:14] a quote in a minute where one leads out
[57:16] to the other but brother random actually
[57:19] covers it in The Invisible Union of the
[57:22] bride of Christ he covers it how that
[57:24] your name can be
[57:26] transferred right I doubt if we get that
[57:29] far okay but if we don't we'll get back
[57:32] to it later but look what it said in
[57:34] Genesis 5 you've got in Genesis 5 a
[57:39] lineage all
[57:41] right now this is in the
[57:44] Bible a
[57:47] lineage and that lineage begins as what
[57:50] this is the book of the generation of
[57:53] Adam
[57:55] all right Genesis 5 in the day that God
[57:59] created man in the likeness of God made
[58:01] he him in male and female then he goes
[58:03] on down eight days of Adam after he had
[58:07] begotten Seth so and so many years all
[58:10] right Seth lived 105 years and be get
[58:14] enus Seth lived after enus and we got
[58:17] Sons and
[58:18] Daughters all right then Seth was so
[58:21] long then enus was so long then it got
[58:23] Canaan
[58:25] all
[58:26] right get the point of what I'm
[58:29] saying it's a natural
[58:33] book The Bible has a lot of natural
[58:37] history that if mankind would just read
[58:40] the
[58:41] Bible they found the day missing in
[58:44] space of their calculation by reading
[58:47] the Bible right they find a lot of
[58:50] things because they got the genealogies
[58:53] is there
[58:55] all right then if you back up look at
[58:57] ver chapter
[59:00] 4 about verse 16 you'll find that it
[59:04] covers the the lineage of Cain and Cain
[59:06] went out in the presence of the Lord and
[59:08] dwelt in the land of n on East Cain knew
[59:10] his wife and and got a son and he named
[59:12] him enus and then it comes from enith to
[59:16] uh irad and I can't pronounce all them
[59:20] names but yet
[59:22] still it's a lineage
[59:27] all right if you got a scofi Bible if
[59:30] you'll look in the bottom notes of it a
[59:32] lot of time he'll tell you where these
[59:34] people went and what country was
[59:39] formed because they they know where they
[59:42] went to all right but I'm just trying to
[59:46] get you to look at
[59:48] something the natural life that we live
[59:52] is written right there in the book
[59:55] we can't argue
[59:57] it you said but my name's not there Paul
[1:00:00] said and such wor some of
[1:00:05] you he doesn't mind getting blunt about
[1:00:08] it does
[1:00:09] he we our natural life is written in the
[1:00:12] book our natural lineage you can take a
[1:00:15] lineage and you can trace that
[1:00:18] lineage of Mankind through the writing
[1:00:22] of the Bible are you following me
[1:00:25] as as man went along this was
[1:00:28] recorded and as these things took place
[1:00:31] it was
[1:00:33] recorded and we know before the
[1:00:35] foundation World God knew how to write
[1:00:37] and that was all
[1:00:38] fine but get the point also he wrote
[1:00:43] down the things you can follow that
[1:00:47] lineage until you could find what
[1:00:48] lineage or what
[1:00:50] is and what people came from what what
[1:00:54] country was formed from what
[1:00:58] lineage because it's a riding it shows
[1:01:01] the the the descendants of
[1:01:04] Cain which would cover The Descendants
[1:01:07] from the
[1:01:08] beast but it shows the descendants of
[1:01:12] Adam through
[1:01:14] Seth and those descendants all
[1:01:18] right it shows those things is coming
[1:01:20] down and and see people in this message
[1:01:22] that're they're quick to talk about a
[1:01:24] lot of lot of preachers are about
[1:01:30] lineages but what good today would it be
[1:01:33] to find out your
[1:01:34] lineage all these lineages is
[1:01:37] wrong whether it be of can from coming
[1:01:40] from the Beast or where it be a Seth
[1:01:42] coming from
[1:01:45] Adam the whole thing's wrong because
[1:01:48] it's no good then you come over to the
[1:01:53] flood and you got such a
[1:01:56] mixture until you're only
[1:01:59] have Noah and his three
[1:02:02] sons and each one of his wife coming
[1:02:05] across all like brother around and said
[1:02:09] then see people have thought that that
[1:02:12] uh being black was a curse that was put
[1:02:14] on
[1:02:15] Cain he said if that be right it would
[1:02:17] have ended at the
[1:02:19] flood
[1:02:22] right he knew how to put things together
[1:02:25] because he read the
[1:02:27] book all right he had read the natural
[1:02:30] book he could tell you the lineage of
[1:02:33] these things so we come over to the
[1:02:36] flood and we cross
[1:02:38] over and it's become so mingled together
[1:02:43] until you know it said that the sons of
[1:02:45] God saw the daughters of man and there
[1:02:47] were GS in the land and things like that
[1:02:51] and the flood took place it had so
[1:02:53] mingled to together until you can no
[1:02:55] longer follow a
[1:02:58] lineage right right now you jump over on
[1:03:02] the other side of the
[1:03:04] flood and you find Noah plant a
[1:03:09] Vineyard which me it took a year or so
[1:03:11] to you
[1:03:12] know a while cuz it said he planted a
[1:03:15] Vineyard Man live quite a while
[1:03:18] there but then you find in the scripture
[1:03:21] there
[1:03:23] that
[1:03:24] believe it's Genesis
[1:03:27] 9 that you'll find that
[1:03:29] ham saw his father's
[1:03:33] nakedness and of course everybody's got
[1:03:36] their own
[1:03:38] philosophy about that some of them call
[1:03:41] him a
[1:03:44] homosexual in this message people cuz
[1:03:47] you know that's where they think
[1:03:48] everything leads
[1:03:50] to but go ahead and put up number five
[1:03:53] brother Miss for but we don't worry
[1:03:55] about
[1:03:56] it go put up number
[1:04:00] five which would be paragraph 157
[1:04:03] questions and answers number two and
[1:04:05] look what brother Ram
[1:04:09] said now ham he did he did not try to
[1:04:12] hide his father's nakedness but laughed
[1:04:15] and made fun of him and God put our
[1:04:17] curse on ham for looking at his father's
[1:04:20] nakedness and not trying to cover up his
[1:04:22] shame I first sermons to try to prove
[1:04:27] what took place there what did it
[1:04:31] matter is that the Revelation or is it
[1:04:34] like the prophet said he laughed at
[1:04:38] him well no no that's just too simple to
[1:04:41] think life well that's
[1:04:43] Bible all right he laughed at it
[1:04:48] okay you know what done God put a curse
[1:04:51] on
[1:04:53] H read your Bible there in in Genesis 9
[1:04:57] he put a curse on
[1:04:59] ham that ham would be the
[1:05:03] servant cuz his two brothers took him
[1:05:05] walk backward and let covering over
[1:05:08] their
[1:05:09] father all
[1:05:11] right now what are you saying brother
[1:05:13] day I'm saying that was written
[1:05:17] naturally to where at least the prophet
[1:05:21] could come and give us the right
[1:05:23] understand understanding because from
[1:05:25] the
[1:05:27] natural we could see the
[1:05:31] spiritual all right see the natural
[1:05:34] Bible was written about Ham and The
[1:05:37] Descendants and
[1:05:39] whatever because it would come over and
[1:05:42] not
[1:05:44] show as we would look at it the seed of
[1:05:47] the serpent in the
[1:05:50] natural it would show what had already
[1:05:52] happened to humanity
[1:05:54] of the seed of the
[1:05:56] serpent right it would show not that's
[1:06:00] my ham was made a
[1:06:02] servant to bring over to show you the
[1:06:06] sin that
[1:06:07] started what about you and
[1:06:10] I how much have we like to make fun of
[1:06:15] people how much have we done in our
[1:06:18] lives you see why we could stop on each
[1:06:21] point cuz of what I want you to do I
[1:06:23] want you to see yourself back
[1:06:26] there cuz if we can't see ourselves back
[1:06:29] there in the writing of the natural we
[1:06:32] sure can't find out what we are in the
[1:06:36] spiritual so then what are we looking
[1:06:41] at God would make a
[1:06:45] servant out of a person that just Li
[1:06:49] it why because it would bring
[1:06:53] over not the seed of the
[1:06:56] serpent but the nature of the
[1:07:01] serpent come on we everyone have the
[1:07:04] nature of the
[1:07:06] serpent we're all born in sin shaped in
[1:07:09] iniquity SP my mothers w a liar we ever
[1:07:11] won but remember brother ROM did not say
[1:07:15] that we were born between Eve and the
[1:07:17] Beast that would have been a natural
[1:07:19] line that's
[1:07:21] right that would have been Cain in his
[1:07:23] Le
[1:07:26] but once it goes so far it becomes so
[1:07:28] mingled together you can't follow
[1:07:30] neither one of the
[1:07:35] DNA the
[1:07:36] lineage all right so then it becomes
[1:07:40] from that over to a spiritual condition
[1:07:43] or an
[1:07:44] existence that would show the nature of
[1:07:47] the serpent could run around didn't say
[1:07:49] we was born from the eve and the Beast
[1:07:51] he said we was born from Eve and the the
[1:07:55] serpent now I don't care how holy you
[1:07:57] think you are and how good your mother
[1:08:00] was and how good your daddy
[1:08:04] was and I'm not throwing off on nobody's
[1:08:08] lineage but if you could prove all the
[1:08:10] way back that your lineage is perfect
[1:08:13] and follow it all the way back which is
[1:08:16] impossible but if you could to go all
[1:08:18] the way back and find yourself in Adam
[1:08:21] remember in Adam all die right right
[1:08:24] so it wouldn't do any
[1:08:26] good but to find ourselves in the
[1:08:29] writing of the
[1:08:31] book The Old Testament even in the
[1:08:33] writing of of what they were doing God
[1:08:36] was making a record of these
[1:08:38] things because it would come over
[1:08:42] then is they saying you can't you can't
[1:08:44] say that ham was a descendant of the
[1:08:50] Beast come on if You' done that then
[1:08:52] you'd have to have at least least Noah's
[1:08:55] wife would have had to been a descendant
[1:08:57] of the
[1:09:00] Beast come on you see that's where it
[1:09:02] would mess up that's why brother R could
[1:09:04] be so blunt he said you think the curse
[1:09:08] made you black he said then that ended
[1:09:09] at the flood because you only had
[1:09:14] Noah in his
[1:09:18] descendants so everybody tries to make
[1:09:20] well this this you know it was this and
[1:09:22] this that brother R said
[1:09:24] that the seed of the serpent came over
[1:09:26] in the
[1:09:31] women you need that quote came over and
[1:09:33] the
[1:09:35] women what's he
[1:09:37] saying well now brother that what he
[1:09:39] saying one of them Ham's wife probably
[1:09:41] she sneaked around and run around a
[1:09:43] little bit and got pregnant before he
[1:09:44] got on up no no no no no I see you're
[1:09:47] theorizing
[1:09:50] something why why theorize it why not
[1:09:52] just take the straight TR truth of
[1:09:54] it the wound of the woman was
[1:09:58] polluted when the act with the Beast
[1:10:01] took place it was polluted anything she
[1:10:04] brought from there was death right you
[1:10:07] and I come we're
[1:10:09] death we're born dead amen
[1:10:13] right don't care how long you live
[1:10:15] you're born dead that's right cuz in the
[1:10:18] writing of the Bible it shows our
[1:10:20] lineage not of the
[1:10:22] natural
[1:10:25] doesn't matter about which lineage we
[1:10:26] come
[1:10:27] from that's what everybody said I've
[1:10:29] heard people say oh they preach too
[1:10:31] lineages so much they say oh if I was
[1:10:34] just just that one
[1:10:36] lineage even heard people say you know
[1:10:39] will me and my wife we'd have another
[1:10:40] child but said it might not be a true
[1:10:44] seed now what kind of a mentality is
[1:10:46] that let alone spiritual Revelation but
[1:10:50] it come from somebody planting a
[1:10:52] seed of a
[1:10:55] lineage if you happen to be a certain
[1:10:59] one boy us Americans that's what they're
[1:11:03] saying now that you can't argue about so
[1:11:05] many people coming over here because we
[1:11:07] everyone come over here will be black
[1:11:10] white red or green we all came over here
[1:11:13] from somewhere right right we wasn't
[1:11:16] original the indan is
[1:11:18] original so they what good would any of
[1:11:20] our lineages
[1:11:22] be
[1:11:25] right like I told you the the black
[1:11:27] people can at least run their
[1:11:29] back they can f figure they come from
[1:11:32] one of those Nations over
[1:11:34] there but show me where you come
[1:11:37] from what do you mean we come from
[1:11:40] England you think that when they sent
[1:11:43] that ships over here to discover America
[1:11:46] that they took all of the doctors and
[1:11:48] the lawyers and the the uh the rich
[1:11:52] people and the and put them on the ship
[1:11:54] and they sail to America no I'm sorry I
[1:11:58] don't talk I don't think that way they
[1:12:01] took the
[1:12:03] scum and then we wind up and that's what
[1:12:06] I tell
[1:12:07] you the America we're Caucasian now
[1:12:10] we're a
[1:12:12] concoction the best way to say it we're
[1:12:14] just a concoction we're a mixture of all
[1:12:16] kind of things what good lineage could
[1:12:19] come out of anything that's what I'm
[1:12:20] telling you the Bible's showing you
[1:12:24] you may think I make a joke out of that
[1:12:26] point it's not a joke it's a truth
[1:12:28] that's what the Bible's showing you the
[1:12:30] Bible's showing you the writing of the
[1:12:31] book is showing you that our lineages is
[1:12:34] not worth anything right
[1:12:37] right the writing of the Bible as it was
[1:12:40] written down through there with man
[1:12:41] coming forth is showing us that we're
[1:12:43] not worth
[1:12:46] anything I don't like you throwing off
[1:12:48] on my Mom and Daddy I ain't throwing off
[1:12:50] on your mom and
[1:12:51] daddy I'm just telling it like like it
[1:12:55] is your mama and daddy was they born
[1:12:58] without
[1:13:00] sin well no you admit that well then
[1:13:03] they're
[1:13:04] Sinners that's why we all need salvation
[1:13:07] amen but we look at something like ham
[1:13:11] and try to theorize a point to bring it
[1:13:14] across instead of just looking at it
[1:13:15] like it
[1:13:16] is everybody on that Ark was perverted
[1:13:20] right I don't like it throwing off on
[1:13:22] Noah I'm not thr off on Noah Noah could
[1:13:25] hear that he said
[1:13:28] amen the guy that brought us over died a
[1:13:32] drunk right
[1:13:36] right see we get into all of the things
[1:13:39] to try to theorize some some but why not
[1:13:42] just look at the Bible and see how it
[1:13:44] was written and see
[1:13:49] ourselves that's the point I'm trying to
[1:13:51] get us to look at see see ourselves in
[1:13:54] the writing of the
[1:13:55] book that's
[1:13:58] me no that wasn't me that that was that
[1:14:01] was that was Cain and and and that
[1:14:05] was no that was
[1:14:07] me cuz that's the way I got my
[1:14:10] start in natural
[1:14:13] life so the Book of Life is covering me
[1:14:17] as to what I am all right then the Bible
[1:14:21] is a record of mankind
[1:14:26] on
[1:14:27] earth
[1:14:29] right it's the record of
[1:14:33] mankind on
[1:14:36] earth now are you witht me to that then
[1:14:38] we'll move on to what I'm trying to
[1:14:40] get it's our record it's looking back
[1:14:43] there and seeing where we started and
[1:14:45] all those things had to be written as I
[1:14:47] said about the Kings and what they done
[1:14:49] and the lineages and you get over there
[1:14:51] to where you just got chapter after
[1:14:53] chapter after chapter of so and so we
[1:14:56] got so and so so and so we got so and so
[1:14:58] so and so we got so and so I told you
[1:15:00] first time I read the Bible you know
[1:15:02] you're supposed to in the Baptist to get
[1:15:03] you a little star you
[1:15:05] know just read the Bible give you a
[1:15:07] little star well I read all that you
[1:15:10] know I got tired of reading so and so we
[1:15:12] got so and so and so and so we got so
[1:15:14] and so and so and so we got so and so
[1:15:15] and so and so we got so and so but you
[1:15:17] know I couldn't turn over a page cuz I
[1:15:18] couldn't say I read the whole
[1:15:21] book right right that's why I read every
[1:15:24] one of them all right I'm not joking I'm
[1:15:27] I'm telling it like it is but it's a
[1:15:31] lineage it's a lineage of
[1:15:35] mankind it shows where we come from and
[1:15:38] where our origin where we're at and they
[1:15:41] they can people that can take that and
[1:15:43] show you exactly where that those
[1:15:46] moabites come from they can show you
[1:15:49] where that Syria where it come from they
[1:15:51] can show you where the EG Egyptians and
[1:15:53] where they come from right out of the
[1:15:56] book to show their lineage you can show
[1:15:59] Israel and where they came
[1:16:01] from right out of the
[1:16:06] book but that ain't all of the book cuz
[1:16:09] I said that's two
[1:16:11] section but that's the writing of the
[1:16:14] natural see our lives in the natural
[1:16:18] then we can begin to
[1:16:20] relate but that's where everybody wants
[1:16:22] to go but R you know I was in Abraham
[1:16:25] when he done this I was in David when he
[1:16:27] killed the bar I was in that's all
[1:16:30] that's all the point we want to
[1:16:33] read but the natural story is our
[1:16:41] life see because if you ain't careful
[1:16:43] you can spiritualize the things on the
[1:16:45] other side and it looks like they don't
[1:16:47] even need a new
[1:16:50] birth but remember we all do
[1:16:54] remember your Prophet is one that said
[1:16:56] he said it doesn't matter whether it's
[1:16:57] priest king or who it is he said I was
[1:17:00] born to
[1:17:04] hybrid people don't like them
[1:17:08] quotes that's not degrading to anybody
[1:17:11] that's telling it like it
[1:17:12] is we were all in that situation amen
[1:17:17] and as the the things were taking place
[1:17:19] but like I said now you you check what
[1:17:21] I'm talking about the this is what I
[1:17:23] found out after coming to
[1:17:25] message so brother Randon would read
[1:17:28] scriptures and he'd read a scripture
[1:17:30] about something you
[1:17:35] know and say that's right in the middle
[1:17:38] of so and so we got so and
[1:17:40] so and maybe the next verse is so and so
[1:17:43] we got so and
[1:17:46] so and I thought you
[1:17:49] know if there was no other reason for WR
[1:17:53] in all of those
[1:17:55] genealogies right there is one verse in
[1:17:58] the
[1:18:01] middle is that all there is to the Bible
[1:18:04] is the one verse that's the point I'm
[1:18:06] trying to get you to see or is the whole
[1:18:09] if the Bible the whole thing showing the
[1:18:11] natural
[1:18:15] life and then showing the the part that
[1:18:18] we lead out to be a spiritual
[1:18:21] life
[1:18:23] showing us to be what would be the true
[1:18:27] thing could now back up to where we were
[1:18:29] this morning about the
[1:18:33] soul why is it then you find that a man
[1:18:37] named
[1:18:40] Abram ordinary human
[1:18:44] being
[1:18:47] right a man named
[1:18:49] Elijah man after like passion
[1:18:54] anything special about
[1:18:56] it oh but brother Dale you just don't
[1:18:59] see that that was that seed that was
[1:19:01] that
[1:19:02] seed what
[1:19:06] seed they can't even prove where Elijah
[1:19:08] come
[1:19:10] from right come on you're a prophet you
[1:19:13] said well he's got to be a gentile but
[1:19:15] he said there's no
[1:19:21] lineage
[1:19:24] but you see then we look at Abraham and
[1:19:26] we like to look at stuff like that
[1:19:28] because we call them the True
[1:19:34] Believers brother said the Believers in
[1:19:36] the
[1:19:39] book see then Abram being a
[1:19:43] man ordinary
[1:19:45] man how many people did God deal with in
[1:19:48] the days of Abraham we say oh he only
[1:19:51] dealt with one where where's your
[1:19:52] thought of
[1:19:53] that why would you have that
[1:19:57] thought when God would that all men be
[1:20:02] saved but you see there was something
[1:20:04] about the man Abram that was
[1:20:09] different and you know what it was a
[1:20:11] longing in his
[1:20:14] heart are you back with me this morning
[1:20:17] David said my soul thirst after thee
[1:20:22] amen
[1:20:23] what's the difference in David and
[1:20:24] anybody else what's the difference in
[1:20:26] David and any other Jew as we'd call
[1:20:29] them
[1:20:31] Israelite what was the difference in
[1:20:33] Abram than anybody else that was
[1:20:36] around the Bible said he believe
[1:20:42] God it didn't say his lineage was
[1:20:47] right come on it didn't say that he was
[1:20:51] a good man
[1:20:55] said he believe
[1:21:01] God see then now you can start picking
[1:21:03] up the Believers that's in the book
[1:21:06] yeah but how high are you going to pick
[1:21:08] them up because remember none of those
[1:21:10] Believers back there had the new birth
[1:21:15] right they were just normal human
[1:21:21] beings
[1:21:23] they were not as set aside certain type
[1:21:25] of
[1:21:26] people now as I said can we associate
[1:21:30] with the writing of the natural book to
[1:21:33] see our lives and how what we are just a
[1:21:35] bunch of garbage
[1:21:38] cans but can you pick up now and begin
[1:21:41] to see that because of that soul in that
[1:21:46] man because that
[1:21:49] man for some unknown reason
[1:21:54] he could believe
[1:21:57] God well you know
[1:22:00] what let me quote brother random you
[1:22:02] know that God expects you to
[1:22:05] believe the
[1:22:11] impossible is it right he expects you to
[1:22:15] believe the
[1:22:18] impossible we are the children of God he
[1:22:23] expects you to believe that we are his
[1:22:26] offspring he expects you to believe
[1:22:29] that you don't have to try to explain it
[1:22:32] right right Abraham or Abram as we
[1:22:35] started when he started out he couldn't
[1:22:37] explain
[1:22:40] nothing I'm sure everybody back there
[1:22:43] had a worship of God or something and
[1:22:45] really the story behind Abram was that
[1:22:47] his daddy was a a maker of Idols to sell
[1:22:52] the people to become their
[1:22:54] gods and the Jewish story goes behind it
[1:22:57] to show that Abram got all upset one day
[1:23:00] and he said well ain't none of these
[1:23:01] worth anything he begins to bust up the
[1:23:03] whole place and he had one that
[1:23:06] evidently he didn't bust up or whatever
[1:23:08] now this is the Jewish
[1:23:11] story and when his daddy come
[1:23:14] back you know what
[1:23:17] happened he said well all these Gods got
[1:23:19] in battle with each
[1:23:21] other and they just fought it out and
[1:23:24] this one guy
[1:23:27] won well whether it be a true story or
[1:23:31] not it gets the
[1:23:35] point something about a man named
[1:23:39] Abram from way down with inside of
[1:23:44] him he began to
[1:23:48] think and he began to wonder what is man
[1:23:55] why was we made like
[1:23:57] this you remember this morning that job
[1:24:00] said I'm not a I'm not a sea you know
[1:24:03] I'm not just water and then he said I'm
[1:24:05] not an animal in other
[1:24:08] words what is
[1:24:14] man see the real part of man is that
[1:24:16] soul that you
[1:24:18] are that part of your being that longs
[1:24:21] after God
[1:24:25] that's what God looks
[1:24:27] at like I said how many people did he
[1:24:30] talked to in the days of Abram but they
[1:24:33] didn't long
[1:24:34] after but here's a
[1:24:36] man that he just hears a
[1:24:43] voice he doesn't have the baptism of the
[1:24:45] Holy Ghost he's not something
[1:24:47] Supernatural some kind of he's just a
[1:24:50] man he hears a
[1:24:55] voice so get out of
[1:24:59] here leave this
[1:25:02] place and go to a place you ain't never
[1:25:10] been
[1:25:13] well even if he's helping his daddy make
[1:25:16] H you had to live
[1:25:19] it
[1:25:21] right so the guy gets up takes his
[1:25:25] family and just moves out where we going
[1:25:28] I don't
[1:25:31] know he didn't tell me where to
[1:25:34] go who's
[1:25:39] he the one that spoke to
[1:25:44] me his wife probably looked at him and
[1:25:46] said he ain't spoke to
[1:25:51] me
[1:25:55] maybe his daddy said that some went with
[1:25:57] him you remember there was lot and
[1:25:59] things like that but you know
[1:26:02] what they finally believed
[1:26:06] him and I guess it come down to the
[1:26:08] bases really it was almost I'm just
[1:26:10] natural just tell it like it is story it
[1:26:12] probably come down to the bases they
[1:26:14] said we can't stay
[1:26:17] here and if he's going I guess we might
[1:26:19] as well get up and go with him oh yeah
[1:26:22] he even though we don't know where we're
[1:26:26] going we see he didn't know where he's
[1:26:28] going either I used to read that I used
[1:26:30] to love to read the Old Testament I used
[1:26:32] to preach from it you know and and I
[1:26:34] preach kind of seriesly like I do now
[1:26:36] the travels of the children of Israel
[1:26:38] and how they'd get in the place that was
[1:26:40] called the way and how they would go
[1:26:42] over here and and then theyd come back
[1:26:43] and they cross that pth again and they'
[1:26:45] get on and they'd run as straight a
[1:26:47] while and then they'd go off and then
[1:26:48] then they come back and you just you
[1:26:50] just follow yourself down through life
[1:26:51] you know and that's what I'm trying to
[1:26:52] do today is get this me and you to look
[1:26:54] at
[1:26:56] it was anything special about
[1:27:01] you oh I was so good until God come
[1:27:07] to then the other side says I was so bad
[1:27:11] did he come
[1:27:14] down
[1:27:16] now what was
[1:27:19] that we certainly don't believe as the
[1:27:22] preachers of the message a lot of them
[1:27:23] try to preach is I come here with
[1:27:24] eternal life I don't believe that I
[1:27:27] believe you come here with
[1:27:28] representation of predes from
[1:27:29] predestination by predestination I
[1:27:31] believe
[1:27:33] that that God
[1:27:35] knew how to cross your
[1:27:37] path the prophet would say it but what
[1:27:41] made you any
[1:27:45] different I mean it was anything
[1:27:50] special or heard did one day something
[1:27:53] just spoke to
[1:27:57] you
[1:28:00] right something just spoke to
[1:28:05] you you listen Maybe to a tap or you
[1:28:08] heard somebody preach and something just
[1:28:10] spoke to
[1:28:16] you something said get up and
[1:28:20] move time for you to go
[1:28:23] you played around long
[1:28:26] enough get up and
[1:28:29] go well you know he don't always argue
[1:28:32] with us either does
[1:28:34] he I mean did he come down about 15
[1:28:37] times and tell you get up and
[1:28:41] go or maybe told you one time get up and
[1:28:44] go and the next time he might tell you
[1:28:45] if you don't get up and go you have
[1:28:47] problem he might do the second part but
[1:28:50] he don't come back three or four times
[1:28:54] times you see there was something about
[1:28:56] that man if you want to make anything
[1:28:58] about Abram there was something about
[1:29:00] that man in his
[1:29:04] soul the inner part of his being that he
[1:29:08] was did he believe
[1:29:12] God why did you come in this
[1:29:16] message was it because somebody could
[1:29:18] out argue other
[1:29:20] people
[1:29:26] why did you choose to come in this
[1:29:31] message why did you choose to come to
[1:29:33] Lula well a know where's else to go
[1:29:35] that's a good point hang around act
[1:29:37] while you leave and somebody else will
[1:29:38] come
[1:29:43] in cuz this thing ain't built off
[1:29:46] of mankind
[1:29:49] right it's like I told Richard when he
[1:29:52] was dating Anna I said I don't want you
[1:29:54] in Georgia because that you're marrying
[1:29:57] my
[1:30:02] daughter that's a good
[1:30:05] point but I I want you to hear in
[1:30:08] Georgia because God speaks to Your Heart
[1:30:10] by the
[1:30:16] word what about
[1:30:19] it we talk about the writing of the
[1:30:21] Bible of of the things like Abraham or
[1:30:24] David or someone like that or the
[1:30:28] prophets but what's so different about
[1:30:30] them
[1:30:35] men something spoke down inside of them
[1:30:38] in their soul
[1:30:43] right what about
[1:30:46] Moses great
[1:30:50] man with his natural ability he would
[1:30:52] have been able to went back down and
[1:30:54] took over
[1:30:56] Egypt now remember he was the ruler of
[1:30:59] the army at one time he could have
[1:31:02] caused an Insurrection he could have
[1:31:03] caused all kind of things could have
[1:31:06] took over and then just give Israel the
[1:31:08] whole land of
[1:31:10] Egypt but the Bible said
[1:31:13] he suffered the things of
[1:31:20] Christ would have been a very easy thing
[1:31:23] to have done it that's why I've always
[1:31:24] believed and maybe you don't agree with
[1:31:26] it that's all right why didn't that
[1:31:29] Pharaoh set the a what his name is the
[1:31:31] boy that was raised up with Moses he
[1:31:33] knew who that guy was standing out there
[1:31:34] he one that rote him
[1:31:38] off why didn't he just wind up and say
[1:31:40] cut that man's
[1:31:44] throat I mean he was King who was going
[1:31:47] to argue with
[1:31:50] him
[1:31:53] why did he let Moses get by what he was
[1:31:58] doing I've always told you my opinion
[1:32:00] whether it's any good or not that man
[1:32:02] was afraid of
[1:32:04] him he wasn't afraid of his God he may
[1:32:07] have wound up to end up being afraid of
[1:32:08] his God because of all he done but he
[1:32:10] wasn't afraid of his
[1:32:11] God he was quick to say throw them
[1:32:14] sticks down and let them become snakes
[1:32:16] just like you bring it I don't bring
[1:32:18] it you wasn't afraid of that but he was
[1:32:22] scared of one
[1:32:24] thing he thought I run this guy off is
[1:32:27] supposed to be dead for some reason he's
[1:32:29] appeared back
[1:32:32] here instead of appearing back here then
[1:32:34] there's something about this thing I
[1:32:36] need to think it over but he mainly was
[1:32:39] afraid of him because he knew that all
[1:32:41] he had to do was cause an Insurrection
[1:32:42] he could take over if he had killed
[1:32:44] Moses it would have been the biggest
[1:32:45] Slaughter had ever been cuz there was a
[1:32:47] lot of people would have believed Moses
[1:32:49] he wouldn't have been fighting just the
[1:32:50] Jews
[1:32:54] he would have been fighting his own
[1:32:55] armies yep that Moses had
[1:33:00] led
[1:33:02] right but what was the difference in
[1:33:06] Moses he heard God speak one day
[1:33:12] right just like Abraham heard God
[1:33:15] speak something down inside of the man
[1:33:18] he heard God
[1:33:20] speak what's it difference in you and
[1:33:22] all the other people in the
[1:33:25] world now they're going to church
[1:33:27] they're claiming Christianity so don't
[1:33:29] don't let on that realm of just you
[1:33:32] know but how come was it you just kept
[1:33:35] coming higher and higher and higher you
[1:33:38] may have started out maybe we all
[1:33:39] started out in a realm like churches or
[1:33:45] anything but what made it different to
[1:33:47] where
[1:33:49] that we just never was satisfied
[1:33:54] that
[1:33:56] true I never come in this message
[1:33:59] because it could somebody could out
[1:34:04] argue I used to lay the books
[1:34:07] down I'd lay him down every morning when
[1:34:09] I get in from work and brother Mo would
[1:34:11] be talking to me and he gave me some
[1:34:14] books and things I used to lay the book
[1:34:16] and the Bible down
[1:34:18] together I used to say
[1:34:22] now God this Bible said there'll be
[1:34:24] false
[1:34:28] prophets this man that they claim to be
[1:34:31] a
[1:34:32] prophet says they will be false
[1:34:37] prophets what if he's one of
[1:34:43] them you didn't never pray that
[1:34:50] way
[1:34:52] he didn't spend hours trying to explain
[1:34:54] it to
[1:34:57] me something spoke I believe in my soul
[1:35:01] and I wasn't even born again at the
[1:35:04] time
[1:35:07] okay something spoke I believed I was I
[1:35:09] thought I was I was a good Baptist
[1:35:11] Deacon and teaching all of the classes
[1:35:14] and adults and everything like that but
[1:35:17] I come find out I wasn't born
[1:35:20] again
[1:35:22] but something said with inside of me he
[1:35:23] said what does the Bible
[1:35:27] say that's the only answer I got I've
[1:35:30] heard people talk about how they argued
[1:35:32] with God God said this they said that
[1:35:35] God said this it's all right that just
[1:35:37] ain't my case he always just drops
[1:35:41] down and he says a word or two and then
[1:35:43] he's gone told you how I studied out
[1:35:46] something that I thought was right in
[1:35:48] the message one time and I had notes
[1:35:50] written down and I would have challenged
[1:35:52] anybody about it cuz I had the Bible in
[1:35:55] the prophet's
[1:35:56] quotes and I sitting there looking at
[1:35:58] them and a voice inside of me said if
[1:36:01] you do that you make your type greater
[1:36:03] than your
[1:36:05] antitype I immediately destroyed those
[1:36:08] notes and burn every shred of them but I
[1:36:11] didn't want nobody to ever think or see
[1:36:13] anything about what it
[1:36:18] was how about that little Ste small
[1:36:20] voice
[1:36:22] andite Elijah in the
[1:36:25] cave Thunders and the Lightnings all of
[1:36:28] the things the other prophets went by
[1:36:29] and he went by them at
[1:36:32] times where winds with joob did he talk
[1:36:36] about where winds the prophets talk
[1:36:38] about those
[1:36:40] things but none of that contacted
[1:36:48] Elijah but a still small voice spoke
[1:36:51] with inside of
[1:36:55] him we're talking about the writing of
[1:36:57] the
[1:36:58] Bible we're picking up now to
[1:37:01] the spiritual form of what you want to
[1:37:03] call
[1:37:05] it the children of God coming forth as
[1:37:08] to looking more like the children of
[1:37:11] God but still not able to come forth
[1:37:14] with a new birth cuz it was not
[1:37:18] time but to show that mankind that's
[1:37:21] where I've always believed
[1:37:25] it What Makes You
[1:37:28] Different cuz you can believe
[1:37:37] God what makes you believe in one God
[1:37:39] when the world can prove a trinity
[1:37:42] maybe and we used to talk about our own
[1:37:44] Trinity right A lot of people in the
[1:37:46] message still in the
[1:37:50] trinities
[1:37:54] what makes it
[1:37:56] different why can't you follow
[1:37:59] these two Souls Two
[1:38:02] Lords River
[1:38:04] Jordans why can't you follow those
[1:38:09] forms when they're big
[1:38:11] names and very
[1:38:14] popular a lot better preacher than I
[1:38:17] that's not a
[1:38:20] joke
[1:38:23] people that can keep you Spellbound by
[1:38:25] their anointings and their
[1:38:29] words the wi that you don't
[1:38:39] believe can you relate back
[1:38:42] there in your own life today can you
[1:38:45] relate back there with

[1:40:28] while say there something about a
[1:40:32] Christian and listen folks that was
[1:40:34] before I was born
[1:40:40] again but something was still
[1:40:42] speaking you say you mean to tell me
[1:40:45] that that God will speak to a person
[1:40:47] that's not a
[1:40:48] Christian sure done a lot of talk in the
[1:40:50] the Old Testament that's the point I'm
[1:40:52] trying to get you to see amen he sure
[1:40:54] spoke to a lot of people back there and
[1:40:57] directed them in a lot of
[1:40:59] ways don't you think he could could
[1:41:01] direct us just a little bit
[1:41:07] amen well how did you find out brother
[1:41:09] Dale that you wern't born again because
[1:41:11] everybody else you know com to the
[1:41:12] message they say well the Holy Ghost
[1:41:13] what led me in the message so I'm must
[1:41:15] have the Holy Ghost I believe the Holy
[1:41:16] Ghost led me into the message but the
[1:41:18] Holy Ghost is one that told me I wasn't
[1:41:19] born again
[1:41:21] you say well how did that happen the
[1:41:24] little still Small
[1:41:28] Voice that told me to leave the
[1:41:30] Baptist told me I wasn't at the place I
[1:41:33] thought I
[1:41:34] was right that I needed a new
[1:41:38] birth I listened to him I wasn't like
[1:41:42] most of the people of this message well
[1:41:44] what do you mean I come into the message
[1:41:46] what else you want
[1:41:49] Lord
[1:41:52] you know that's the way I still
[1:41:58] think I still wait for that little still
[1:42:01] Small
[1:42:02] Voice I didn't have one note written for
[1:42:04] this
[1:42:05] message but on Brother Richard Wilson's
[1:42:08] tape last night cuz I thought about
[1:42:10] going some way which way to
[1:42:12] go and brother richer started talking
[1:42:15] about the book of life and the things or
[1:42:18] something in the form in the message
[1:42:21] and the little voice said you speak
[1:42:24] about the writing of the
[1:42:26] book that's what I'm
[1:42:30] doing so I don't come here and preach to
[1:42:32] you until I got a
[1:42:36] thought I can just that's easy of me to
[1:42:38] come here and tell you don't have
[1:42:39] nothing we just that somebody else can
[1:42:41] preach or or we'll sing songs and PR
[1:42:44] tape and we'll go home or whatever
[1:42:45] that's no problem with
[1:42:47] me but he's never failed I've been
[1:42:49] sitting in the office
[1:42:53] and get a
[1:42:54] message now I don't agree with getting
[1:42:58] too many of them from
[1:43:01] Walmart you get a lot of messages there
[1:43:04] you'd like to preach
[1:43:05] but you know the people that's there is
[1:43:08] not hearing
[1:43:10] them and the people that are
[1:43:14] here you
[1:43:18] know but listen
[1:43:21] Abraham get
[1:43:25] up I don't understand
[1:43:28] it I just get up and
[1:43:34] go
[1:43:37] David you can bring out a lot about
[1:43:39] David in many different ways but you
[1:43:41] know he had a little closer point
[1:43:45] because he was anointed to be
[1:43:49] king and he knew if he made it to a line
[1:43:51] and a
[1:43:52] bar that God must have a reason in his
[1:43:55] life he's anointed to be
[1:43:58] king well he knew one thing for certain
[1:44:01] whether it be Goliath or anybody
[1:44:03] wouldn't going to stop him from being
[1:44:04] King right right cuz he believed that
[1:44:08] Prophet right what about it do we
[1:44:11] believe this
[1:44:13] Prophet do we believe this Prophet that
[1:44:17] said as I've given you the quote the
[1:44:18] other night this bride is going to prove
[1:44:22] to Satan that she won't believe his lie
[1:44:25] amen right she's going to prove it to
[1:44:28] him she won't believe his lie same
[1:44:33] lie he told in heaven the same lie that
[1:44:35] he told
[1:44:37] Eve tell we going to believe
[1:44:41] that he said things look so bad look at
[1:44:44] a sick and and all kind of things what's
[1:44:46] that got to do with it
[1:44:49] right but you see I still believe one
[1:44:53] thing the prophet of God said there's
[1:44:55] going to be a bride's
[1:45:00] Revival not for the world no but a
[1:45:04] bride's
[1:45:07] Revival I still believe where he said
[1:45:10] the sick would be healed the dead would
[1:45:11] be raised limbs would be
[1:45:14] restored I still believe that why cuz
[1:45:18] something spoke to me one day by way of
[1:45:21] a
[1:45:26] prophet how about ever talk to you now
[1:45:29] brother D God don't talk to nobody but a
[1:45:33] prophet well I know what camp you're
[1:45:37] in you know I know where you're
[1:45:42] from you want me to bring out your point
[1:45:46] you're the guy that was standing back
[1:45:47] there talking to Moses one day and said
[1:45:51] you think you're spiritual you think the
[1:45:53] word don't come to us
[1:45:56] also and God said okay line up let's
[1:46:00] see speaking through the prophet Moses
[1:46:03] right line up and let's see who sides on
[1:46:08] what but it's like I've always told you
[1:46:11] you ain't going to convert
[1:46:14] nobody because even in that natural
[1:46:16] Story one time there that the ground of
[1:46:20] believe opened up what wasn't that the
[1:46:21] one and the next day is that the same
[1:46:24] one the next day they come to Moses and
[1:46:28] said you kill the people of God that's
[1:46:32] right now how carnal dumb whatever would
[1:46:36] be the word for it could be in a human
[1:46:39] mortal that one day could see the ground
[1:46:41] open up at the voice of a man and then
[1:46:44] come back and tell him he killed the
[1:46:45] people of
[1:46:47] God goes for certain they didn't
[1:46:50] hear that
[1:46:52] voice
[1:46:54] right why can't we believe that God
[1:46:56] talks to
[1:47:00] mankind didn't he tell you this message
[1:47:02] was
[1:47:03] right th must have spoke to
[1:47:07] you but are you following me I'm running
[1:47:10] late now cuz I got off my notes and
[1:47:11] started
[1:47:14] preaching see the records of the
[1:47:16] prophets Elijah so forth and all
[1:47:23] they just
[1:47:25] took and that
[1:47:27] Soul the words that come into their
[1:47:31] being and the Bible said that that God
[1:47:34] spoke in times past Hebrews one in the
[1:47:40] prophets so came into that soul of that
[1:47:43] individual until that man would stand
[1:47:45] and speak back out until even it would
[1:47:48] look like that he was God and he was in
[1:47:50] the first person at those
[1:47:54] times Isaiah would write they pierce my
[1:47:57] hands and my feet or p is
[1:48:02] WR what about
[1:48:08] it but then here is what people see they
[1:48:10] see John the Baptist
[1:48:14] arising a man that never done a
[1:48:19] miracle
[1:48:20] right right wound up with a handful of
[1:48:27] converts is that
[1:48:29] true right but he was told what would
[1:48:32] happen and he'd see the Holy Ghost
[1:48:34] descending he believed it that's right
[1:48:38] right he went out there and he
[1:48:40] introduced the Lord Jesus Christ to the
[1:48:43] world right in the
[1:48:49] book
[1:48:50] all
[1:48:53] right then that Lord Jesus Christ came
[1:48:56] I'll have to bypass all this and get it
[1:48:57] later the Lord Jesus Christ came on the
[1:48:59] scene which was the book you
[1:49:03] agree but you know that didn't stop the
[1:49:05] writing of the
[1:49:07] book because it produced what was there
[1:49:10] that it said it would produce that
[1:49:11] didn't stop the
[1:49:14] writing you got the book of Acts
[1:49:18] written true
[1:49:22] of the Holy Ghost coming in the
[1:49:26] church speaking through the
[1:49:29] people all
[1:49:31] right it's where was at over in
[1:49:33] Revelations 2
[1:49:36] there so you say well the writing of the
[1:49:38] book stopped no it didn't stop because
[1:49:40] you've got Peter James John Jude all of
[1:49:44] them as they begin to
[1:49:46] write what God
[1:49:49] Said it was about their own lives and
[1:49:53] things the writing of the
[1:49:56] book and it got into a spiritual
[1:49:59] condition by then through the baptism of
[1:50:01] the Holy Ghost how much more sure would
[1:50:04] we believe that to be the book as we
[1:50:06] would to compare to those who were back
[1:50:08] there that didn't have the new
[1:50:11] birth how much more would we believe
[1:50:13] that Paul was speaking God's
[1:50:16] word over the fact of believing Moses
[1:50:19] spoke God's word
[1:50:21] cuz Moses was a
[1:50:23] man but without the baptism of the Holy
[1:50:26] Ghost Paul was a
[1:50:28] man but by the new
[1:50:31] birth could speak the very words of
[1:50:35] God all right that didn't end the
[1:50:38] writing of the
[1:50:40] book CU John goes to patas and he writes
[1:50:44] Revelations 2 and
[1:50:47] 3 and he tells about the church ages
[1:50:53] and what each Church age would be and
[1:50:55] what they were
[1:50:57] doing we could spend all afternoon
[1:50:59] preaching about how we would be related
[1:51:01] to those
[1:51:03] things well brother Dale that come in
[1:51:06] over in the Book of Revelation and it
[1:51:07] finished no
[1:51:10] sorry you didn't listen to the scripture
[1:51:12] that
[1:51:14] read cuz it said ye are written
[1:51:18] Epistles know and read of all
[1:51:21] mankind God is still
[1:51:24] writing his
[1:51:26] book you are the final Pages now the
[1:51:29] Book of Revelations I no that carries on
[1:51:31] down through the natural and the
[1:51:35] things we are the last words written in
[1:51:38] this
[1:51:39] book because I thought we
[1:51:44] believed that the prophet of God
[1:51:48] said let be be a book of
[1:51:53] Acts
[1:51:55] written about the bride of Christ he
[1:51:59] said it just won't be nobody to read
[1:52:01] it that's his words right won't be
[1:52:04] nobody here to read it because is a
[1:52:06] finishing up amen God's still writing
[1:52:09] God's still talking God's still leading
[1:52:13] how do you get where you're at that's
[1:52:16] right well I just decided to go
[1:52:22] H it wasn't you
[1:52:24] decided why you wind up driving so far
[1:52:27] to get
[1:52:35] here like Rick saying you hitch
[1:52:39] maybe didn't hit
[1:52:43] here you know you can't explain it can
[1:52:47] you you can't explain the soul of an
[1:52:49] individual and how that soul of that
[1:52:51] individual can believe
[1:52:57] God you know that you're expected to
[1:53:01] believe that somebody will be changed in
[1:53:04] a moment at twink of an
[1:53:06] eye but that's what God Said would take
[1:53:10] place you're expected to believe that
[1:53:12] God will descend from heaven with a
[1:53:15] shout the voice of an archangel or the
[1:53:17] trumpet
[1:53:18] calling you're expected to believe that
[1:53:21] the bride will be the final voice to the
[1:53:24] final age under her
[1:53:31] messenger you expected to believe a lot
[1:53:34] of
[1:53:37] things expected to believe that God
[1:53:40] speaks to you
[1:53:42] yes still in that same
[1:53:45] soul that he started talking to
[1:53:48] Abram
[1:53:51] that same soul that he spoke
[1:53:54] to Abel and said give an
[1:54:00] offering of a
[1:54:05] lamb you know but what there's many
[1:54:09] voices so Cain heard
[1:54:12] one so spoke inside of the soul of
[1:54:16] Cain and said make a beautiful altar
[1:54:23] which one's
[1:54:27] right Abel's voice that he heard and the
[1:54:30] things that happen will compare with
[1:54:32] every scripture in the
[1:54:35] Bible canes will
[1:54:38] not so we know which one's right there's
[1:54:41] many voices the scripture says in this
[1:54:44] last days they got many doctrines flying
[1:54:47] in the
[1:54:48] message how we going to know the
[1:54:51] truth brother Dale how do you check out
[1:54:54] things come on musicians how do you
[1:54:56] check out things brother Dale you've
[1:54:58] heard me how many
[1:55:00] times I check a Doctrine by my new
[1:55:03] birth what else can I check it with you
[1:55:06] say quotes they can quote you quotes
[1:55:08] like
[1:55:12] quotes
[1:55:14] right I check it by my new
[1:55:17] birth now who you to check anything well
[1:55:20] I'm me who are
[1:55:24] you I check it by my new
[1:55:28] birth because if they speak anything
[1:55:31] contrary to what happened to me in the
[1:55:33] new birth I know one thing for
[1:55:36] sure if what I've got is right they're
[1:55:41] wrong but if they're right then I'm
[1:55:44] wrong and I've been hearing some wrong
[1:55:48] voices what about
[1:55:52] you no it's a voice of God because it
[1:55:55] always speaks so nice and
[1:55:57] sweet God don't always speak nice and
[1:56:01] sweet right sometimes he says sit down
[1:56:05] shut
[1:56:09] up do what I
[1:56:14] said oh but no brother Dale you've never
[1:56:17] heard the voice of God it is just so
[1:56:19] sweet and lovely amen I've heard
[1:56:26] it but I've also heard him when he had
[1:56:28] to tell
[1:56:29] me get straightened up amen that's right
[1:56:33] let's stand together I told you about
[1:56:34] the time that I was there home and boy I
[1:56:37] was just having me a pity party and I
[1:56:39] was really just you know things was
[1:56:41] going wrong here and I was praying about
[1:56:44] it and doing everything in the book and
[1:56:45] trying to help and everything and oh
[1:56:47] about having me a pity party and I
[1:56:49] started out the road just driving I was
[1:56:52] just going I didn't know what to do and
[1:56:54] I started driving out the road and I met
[1:56:56] one of the kids I remember way ter one
[1:56:58] said where you going Daddy I said I'm
[1:56:59] just going down the road I'll be back
[1:57:00] after a
[1:57:01] while I went down the road and I got
[1:57:04] nearly to maaz well about 5 miles and I
[1:57:06] was really crying and sincere I thought
[1:57:10] about that time something began to
[1:57:13] talk inside of
[1:57:15] me said who you think you
[1:57:18] are
[1:57:22] did you think you're going through
[1:57:24] troubles he said is any of the troubles
[1:57:26] you're going through in any comparison
[1:57:28] to what I went
[1:57:30] through and said
[1:57:33] besides you know in other words I could
[1:57:35] be causing what's going
[1:57:36] on to find out what you would
[1:57:40] do I turned
[1:57:43] around and I cried all the way
[1:57:46] back I'm still crying now about it
[1:57:51] because he said who do you think you
[1:57:55] are you think you're going through more
[1:57:58] troubles than I've ever been
[1:58:00] through it's me that they're speaking
[1:58:02] against it's not
[1:58:07] you makes a lot of difference same
[1:58:11] crying but a lot of
[1:58:14] difference what is man
[1:58:18] oh
[1:58:21] and can we see ourselves in the writing
[1:58:22] of the
[1:58:24] book as being a people that all the way
[1:58:27] down through there could hear the voice
[1:58:28] of God and believe
[1:58:31] it that's the only difference between us
[1:58:33] and anybody
[1:58:36] else we could hear that voice and
