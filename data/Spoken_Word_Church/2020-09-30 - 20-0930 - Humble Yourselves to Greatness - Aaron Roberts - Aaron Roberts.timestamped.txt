[2:59] other than salvation and and uh i always
[3:02] tell everybody i'll get in trouble for
[3:03] this but i tell it anyway
[3:05] uh ruth graham billy graham's wife
[3:10] said in an interview after they'd been
[3:11] married 50 something years they asked
[3:12] her and she said no
[3:14] i never thought about divorce she said i
[3:15] contemplated murder a few times
[3:18] but but never divorce and i always say
[3:20] sarah's probably thought about murder a
[3:22] few times but i don't know about divorce
[3:24] but
[3:25] she has thought about murder so so i
[3:28] thank the lord i'm still here
[3:31] but i will i will hear about that
[3:32] tonight but that's all right i still see
[3:34] it
[3:35] still love her so but uh good to be in
[3:38] the house the lord know i appreciate
[3:40] yes and uh a lot of you may not know
[3:42] that wade was one of my groomsmen
[3:45] and he also participated in the in the
[3:47] wedding
[3:48] yeah run around that's right
[3:52] he was on the grooms and they'd run out
[3:53] and run back in the church come back
[3:55] here and dismissed everybody
[3:57] so it was it was a lot of fun yes it was
[3:59] a good time
[4:01] but uh anyway we don't want to hold you
[4:02] too long and uh just want to get to the
[4:04] word
[4:05] um matthew chapter 18.
[4:08] beginning of verse one and we're gonna
[4:09] read from james chapter four
[4:13] and uh i want to look at
[4:16] something to tonight um
[4:21] i've been doing some studying on
[4:25] on the early church
[4:28] and looking at the apostolic church
[4:32] and the apostolic doctrine
[4:35] and you know one of the things that that
[4:37] came about and all this and
[4:39] you know i was i've been working on
[4:41] trying to do
[4:43] you know i wanted to do a little do a
[4:45] sermon or something on that and
[4:46] and this just kept coming back to me
[4:48] because you know
[4:50] the scripture tells us that you know
[4:52] they
[4:53] in the book of acts said they took
[4:54] everything that they had and they sold
[4:56] everything
[4:56] and everybody had everything in common
[4:59] and you know it didn't matter
[5:00] what they done nobody lacked anything
[5:03] nobody had too much nobody had too
[5:04] little they all had what they had need
[5:06] of and they sold and they had everything
[5:07] in common
[5:08] and you know one of the things that i
[5:10] was looking at was the humbleness
[5:12] that they had and even the scripture
[5:15] tells us to be of humble mind
[5:18] and you know you know i just kept coming
[5:20] back to this thought right here humble
[5:22] ourselves
[5:24] because this is a this is the passage
[5:26] that jesus speaks of here in matthew
[5:29] and uh that's what i want to talk about
[5:30] tonight it's going to be just a very
[5:32] simple thought but i just want to
[5:34] share this with you tonight and hope
[5:35] it's be an encouragement to you and
[5:37] you know because if you
[5:41] you know when you when you look at this
[5:43] when jesus talks about being a little
[5:45] child
[5:46] and have childlike faith you know you
[5:49] can move mountains
[5:51] amen so let's just all bow our heads
[5:53] tonight we'll just speak to the author
[5:55] and
[5:56] and just commit everything to him
[5:59] heavenly father we thank you for this
[6:01] opportunity to be in your house tonight
[6:02] lord
[6:03] lord we're just so thankful lord you
[6:05] said whether wherever two or three are

[6:12] that are at home listening in lord

[6:20] and i pray lord that it may be many
[6:22] miles between us lord but we'll be one

[6:38] it
[6:38] and put it in my mouth lord to be spoke
[6:41] lord you said if someone had a need or
[6:42] they had a question you'd put a man
[6:44] behind the pulpit
[6:46] lord you can supernaturally give me
[6:47] anything to to be
[6:49] spoken lord to meet any need
[6:53] lord we just look unto you lord because
[6:55] we believe that you can do all things

[6:59] lord that we would have ears to hear
[7:02] lord and a
[7:03] mouth to speak lord jesus father as a
[7:07] as isaiah lord as the angel took the
[7:09] cold from i off the
[7:11] off the altar lord and touched his mouth
[7:13] lord touch our mouths tonight lord jesus
[7:15] that

[7:34] touches each one tonight touch brother
[7:35] dale
[7:36] lord in his body lord and you know we he
[7:40] has stood for us many times already
[7:41] stood in the gap for us lord
[7:43] interceding on our behalves and now it's
[7:45] time for us to
[7:46] stand to intercede for him lord lord
[7:49] you're the same yesterday today and
[7:51] forever

[7:54] it again and we believe that you will

[7:58] different ones lord that we know of that

[8:00] and afflicted in our bodies lord jesus
[8:03] we know that you minister in a special
[8:04] way lord you said you sent your word and
[8:06] you healed them and you delivered them
[8:07] from their destruction
[8:09] lord we believe that lord we commit all
[8:12] things to you lord
[8:14] lord as as we go forth lord from this
[8:16] day lord
[8:17] we want to be closer to you not further
[8:19] away
[8:20] lord let us be stronger in the faith
[8:23] lord we commit all things to you we
[8:24] thank you for all your blessings on us
[8:26] in the name of jesus christ we pray
[8:28] amen amen matthew chapter 18 verse 1
[8:32] and it says at the same time came the
[8:34] disciples unto jesus saying
[8:36] who is the greatest in the kingdom of
[8:38] heaven and jesus
[8:40] called a little child unto him and he
[8:42] said him in the midst of them
[8:43] and said verily i say unto you except
[8:45] you be converted
[8:47] and become as little children ye shall
[8:49] not enter into the kingdom of heaven
[8:51] whosoever therefore shall humble himself
[8:54] as this little child
[8:55] the same is greatest in the kingdom of
[8:58] heaven
[8:59] james chapter 4 verse 10 says
[9:02] humble yourselves in the sight of the
[9:04] lord and he shall lift you up
[9:06] amen god bless you tonight you have your
[9:09] seats
[9:13] so brother brown says in the message
[9:19] my new ministry in 1959
[9:22] he says do you remember when john went
[9:24] came preaching the bible foretold that
[9:26] every mountain would be brought low and
[9:28] every low place
[9:28] would be lifted up see when it come
[9:32] you would think he would be coming out
[9:34] of heaven with fire
[9:35] chariots but what was it but a poor man
[9:38] dressed in a piece of sheepskin wrapped
[9:40] around him and out of
[9:41] the banks of jordan preaching on the
[9:43] muddy banks
[9:44] not even in the church but god called
[9:46] that great
[9:48] and when jesus said to the disciples
[9:50] that there wasn't one born
[9:52] of a woman as great as john the baptist
[9:55] you take all the kings and david the
[9:56] prophet
[9:57] and all of his great splendor and
[9:59] solomon they didn't even touch john and
[10:01] yet
[10:02] he didn't have a place to lay his head
[10:04] so you don't have to be rich and mighty
[10:06] in this world to be great in the sight
[10:07] of god
[10:07] you only have to be humble in your heart
[10:10] and god calls that greatness
[10:12] he he that's great enough to humble
[10:16] himself
[10:17] that's a great person that'll take the
[10:19] blame for everything
[10:20] that'll humble himself that's greatness
[10:24] amen and as brother
[10:27] bob was speaking on sunday this is from
[10:29] first peter 5.
[10:31] he says likewise you younger submit
[10:33] yourselves unto the elder
[10:34] yea all of you be subject one to another
[10:37] and be clothed with humility for god
[10:39] resists as the proud
[10:40] but giveth grace to the humble humble
[10:42] yourselves before
[10:44] therefore unto the mighty hand of god
[10:46] that he may exalt you
[10:48] in due time amen so i just want to speak
[10:51] on that tonight
[10:52] about being humble before god
[10:56] and you know there's many people in the
[10:58] world you know they want to be
[11:00] they want to be great just as the
[11:02] disciples you know won't know who was
[11:03] the greatest in the kingdom and
[11:05] you know jesus said in mark he said
[11:08] whoever is going to be the greatest or
[11:10] the chiefest among you he shall be the
[11:12] servant of all and you know
[11:14] that you know when you look at a as a
[11:16] servant you know a servant is a person
[11:18] that humbles themselves a person is not
[11:19] someone
[11:20] that does their own one their own will
[11:22] but it's that they follow the will of
[11:24] the master
[11:25] and you know jesus said you know that he
[11:27] said i come to do the will of my father
[11:29] it's not it's not what i
[11:31] want to do he said but it's the will of
[11:33] the father he said
[11:34] he said the son can do nothing in
[11:36] himself except what he saith the father
[11:38] do
[11:39] that doeth the son likewise so he
[11:40] followed exactly
[11:42] and that's what we have to do is to if
[11:44] we want to be great in the kingdom of
[11:46] god because we all want to be great
[11:48] in in the kingdom of god you know the
[11:51] world is full of people that trying to
[11:52] be great at something
[11:54] you know they're trying to fulfill this
[11:56] desire but you know the greatest desire
[11:58] is to fulfill the word of god is to
[12:00] fulfill the will of god whatever
[12:02] and we know that the will is the word of
[12:04] god and you know
[12:05] and if it if you have a question it's in
[12:08] the word of god that's where you find it
[12:10] you know i was speaking to somebody just
[12:11] this week and we were talking about
[12:14] people being you know the the issue that
[12:16] a lot of people have today in this world
[12:18] is they've not been converted they don't
[12:20] even know what the word convert means
[12:22] you know because you look at people
[12:24] today and you know they they
[12:26] are so wrapped up in so many things but
[12:28] this but the scripture says you know
[12:30] you need to have a change you know you
[12:32] need to be converted a convert
[12:34] a conversion is a change you know
[12:36] something that takes place
[12:37] you do away with the old the old part of
[12:40] you the old man it
[12:42] dies yeah it has to be a change there
[12:43] has to be something because you can't be
[12:45] the same old person
[12:47] and and be the same and follow god
[12:50] and he said he said unless you be
[12:52] converted
[12:54] and you know we were talking you know
[12:55] there's a lot of people that you know a
[12:56] lot of people are just
[12:57] church goers you know they just want to
[12:59] sit on a pew they just want to do their
[13:01] religious duty
[13:02] but they don't know what a conversion is
[13:04] they don't know what
[13:06] they don't know what a relationship with
[13:08] jesus christ
[13:09] is you know there's a lot of people that
[13:11] even stand behind the pulpits as
[13:13] as i was speaking to a man that's just a
[13:15] denominational christian
[13:17] this week but you know we were talking
[13:18] about you there's people that stand
[13:20] behind the pulpit
[13:21] and you know they don't even believe the
[13:23] bible they don't even believe what the
[13:25] scripture says but they want to preach a
[13:27] gospel well you know what
[13:28] you know if if i was going to preach
[13:31] you know i mean you know i would just
[13:33] sit down if i didn't believe any more
[13:34] than than that
[13:35] because you know you know it's just like
[13:37] we just get up and we're just
[13:38] repeating what somebody else has said
[13:40] but it's not a real true revelation to
[13:43] us it's not something that's real to us
[13:45] that you know it doesn't really do
[13:46] anybody any good it has to be something
[13:48] that has to be a personal
[13:49] relationship a personal experience to
[13:51] you and that's just what is lacking i
[13:53] said because
[13:54] you know we've got to be converted we've
[13:56] got to be
[13:57] changed we've got to we've got to have a
[13:59] no-sew relationship we've got to know
[14:01] for a fact what is what is truth we've
[14:04] got to know and
[14:05] you know we're talking about people
[14:06] people don't have don't have that and
[14:08] it's not being preached in churches it's
[14:10] just
[14:12] it's just you know just go to church and
[14:14] put your name on the roll and say a
[14:15] little creed
[14:16] and do this and just go right on out the
[14:18] door and they just kind of live any kind
[14:20] of thing
[14:20] and it's just like you know they come
[14:22] back and they they you see people
[14:23] they'll come to the altar
[14:25] and now and they'll confess their sins
[14:26] and they'll want to change and then they
[14:28] go right back and they go do the exact
[14:30] same thing that they've done that
[14:31] they've done in the past and they come
[14:33] back and they want to
[14:34] say well i just want to change right
[14:35] here and then i go right back out the
[14:36] door and they do the exact same thing
[14:38] well the problem is is when you change
[14:40] right here and you come and you say well
[14:41] i want to change when you walk out that
[14:43] door then you don't walk the same places
[14:45] that you walked before you don't do the
[14:46] same things that you've done before
[14:48] because the problem is is just like when
[14:50] brother brandon was speaking to that
[14:51] that woman that young lady you know that
[14:54] she was such a dancer and she loved she
[14:56] loved to dance and
[14:57] you know she that was where she loved to
[14:59] be well then you know she went on the
[15:01] devil's ground out there and decided you
[15:03] know i'm going to go on the devil's
[15:04] ground
[15:05] but she thought well i'm good enough
[15:06] that i can stand here and i can witness
[15:08] under the atmosphere of that dance hall
[15:11] but you know what the next thing you
[15:12] know
[15:13] she was sucked right back in now why
[15:14] because she was back under that
[15:16] atmosphere
[15:17] of that dance hallway because that's
[15:19] where she had a problem
[15:20] and the problem is is you can't be under
[15:22] the same atmosphere
[15:23] and living in the same way and think
[15:25] you're going to get you're going to get
[15:26] free of that
[15:27] the bible says that we should resist the
[15:29] devil and he'll free
[15:31] he'll flee from us but you know you've
[15:32] got to come to a place that you've got
[15:34] to step back away from those
[15:35] kind of things and that's where you get
[15:37] you get to a conversion
[15:38] is you don't go back to the same things
[15:40] you don't read the same things you don't
[15:42] listen to the same people
[15:46] it's the same it's gotta you gotta come
[15:47] through a change
[15:50] you know i listen to you know everybody
[15:51] listens to dave ramsey and you know
[15:53] sometimes as people call in and you know
[15:55] sometimes dave has to tell people it's
[15:57] the same thing you know because
[15:58] they go right back to doing the exact
[16:00] same thing
[16:02] they want to change but you know what
[16:03] they don't break their old habits
[16:07] and he said you're going way down the
[16:08] road to dumb and
[16:10] you got to make a detour well that's the
[16:12] same thing you know people
[16:13] people want to go do the exact same
[16:14] thing well you've got to get a place
[16:16] where you turn around
[16:19] you can't be going the same direction
[16:21] there has to be a change
[16:26] you know we've got we've got to commit
[16:27] it to god that he can do this
[16:32] and it's so funny because you know the
[16:34] one thing that people we hear people
[16:36] talk about
[16:37] uh you know they try to pray they want
[16:40] to they want to seek god for an answer
[16:41] and seek god for an answer and they want
[16:43] to pray
[16:44] and pray and they're trying to get an
[16:45] answer well the problem is is they don't
[16:47] spend any time in the word
[16:50] you know this this is where you this is
[16:52] where god can speak to you but you know
[16:54] if you don't ever crack this
[16:55] open and here and you want to read some
[16:57] kind of self-help book
[16:58] or you want to read something else and
[17:00] you know because it doesn't matter you
[17:02] know
[17:02] dear abby's not going to help you and dr
[17:05] dobson is not going to help you and dr
[17:06] spock and and all the rest of them you
[17:09] know everybody wants to read all the
[17:10] psycho bible that's out there but you
[17:12] know that's not going to change you
[17:13] because you know what it takes
[17:15] the power of the holy ghost to change
[17:17] you you're not going to change because
[17:19] you know a lot of people
[17:19] they they they live to a place where
[17:21] they they try to
[17:23] work it up in themselves but you know
[17:24] what they drive themselves crazy
[17:26] trying to live something without having
[17:28] a conversion and allowing something to
[17:31] take place in their life and if you
[17:32] allow that to change you
[17:34] then you won't have to worry about
[17:35] having a struggle with something why
[17:37] because you're allowed it's not low it's
[17:38] no longer i that live now but it's
[17:41] christ that liveth in me
[17:42] so if we allow him to take over then he
[17:45] can he can live
[17:46] through us and he can lead us to the
[17:48] place that we can overcome
[17:50] it's no longer me that's trying to
[17:51] overcome it's allowing him to overcome
[17:54] through me
[17:56] i'm not trying to overcome why because
[17:59] he's the one that's overcome
[18:03] he's the one that's overcome he has the
[18:04] overcoming power he gives us the power
[18:06] to overcome
[18:08] we can't do it in ourselves but we must
[18:11] be like
[18:12] these little children and humble
[18:13] ourselves humble ourselves and realize
[18:16] you know we can't do it in ourselves we
[18:18] can't do this alone
[18:19] let us be humble about it
[18:23] many people they want to do that
[18:27] looking at trying to find something in
[18:29] themselves but it won't ever work
[18:35] brother ram says in god hiding himself
[18:38] in simplicity
[18:39] he said you know god is so great he
[18:42] hides himself in simplicity and then
[18:44] he reveals himself in the same thing he
[18:46] hides himself in
[18:47] and god is so great that he can make
[18:49] himself simple that's what makes him
[18:51] great
[18:52] he said so so many miss him in the
[18:55] simplicity simple ways that he hides
[18:57] himself
[18:57] now we know that man cannot do this man
[19:00] cannot
[19:01] make himself great enough to be simple
[19:03] see
[19:04] now what makes god so great is because
[19:07] he can be
[19:08] so simple and god does not reveal
[19:10] himself in greatness
[19:11] as we call greatness but he
[19:14] makes himself great by being simple
[19:18] and humbling himself and being so simple
[19:21] and all the way through the scripture
[19:23] we'll find people that are that have
[19:24] been
[19:25] humble themselves and and simple and
[19:28] what god
[19:29] wanted them to do and it was so simple
[19:31] and yet there were some people that had
[19:32] a hard time with that
[19:34] they couldn't follow the simplicity they
[19:36] couldn't be humble enough
[19:38] just to follow the simple plan that god
[19:40] had laid out
[19:42] you know brother adam talks about and
[19:43] and and talking about noah
[19:45] he said you know noah had 120 years that
[19:47] he preached
[19:48] a message that it's going to reign it
[19:51] was
[19:52] a simple message it was a simple message
[19:55] and you know what no uh noah was just
[19:57] humble enough just to go out there
[19:59] and do what god told him to do he went
[20:02] out and built an
[20:03] ark and got together and you know what
[20:06] and god
[20:06] actually gave him the plan on how to
[20:09] build the ark
[20:10] he didn't have to figure out nothing god
[20:12] told him just how big to make it
[20:14] how wide what you what would to use and
[20:17] all the
[20:17] all the process of how to build the
[20:19] thing was given to him and all he had to
[20:21] do was go do it
[20:23] and the whole time he stood there and
[20:24] all he had to do was tell the people
[20:26] it's going to rain
[20:27] it's going to rain and the people's like
[20:30] well we can
[20:31] prove brother ram said that the
[20:33] civilization in noah's day was so
[20:35] greater was greater than ours
[20:37] but he said you know he said they could
[20:38] shoot the sky and they could tell them
[20:39] there's no rain up there there's no
[20:41] moisture how are you going to get
[20:42] moisture out of the sky
[20:43] there's nothing up there for it to
[20:44] happen he said that's all right he said
[20:47] it doesn't matter
[20:48] god said it's going to rain that's right
[20:51] you know and it's you know it's amazing
[20:53] that you're standing there in a
[20:55] day and a at a time where nobody had
[20:58] ever seen that happen
[21:00] nobody had ever seen rainfall from the
[21:02] sky
[21:03] never had that happen and then here he
[21:05] is this man
[21:06] building a boat building this great big
[21:09] ark
[21:10] that he's going to build and he's going
[21:11] to put the animals on there
[21:15] you know how ridiculous does that look
[21:17] how crazy do you have to be to be in
[21:19] that kind of situation
[21:21] you know but you know what god was it
[21:23] had a very simple plan
[21:25] and it was a very simple message and you
[21:27] know what god done exactly what he said
[21:29] all he had to do was get one man
[21:31] that would do exactly what he wanted him
[21:32] to do and that was to get out and preach
[21:34] the gospel to the people to tell him
[21:36] that judgment was coming upon the people
[21:39] and it was judgment judgment's coming
[21:41] but guess what god never brings judgment
[21:42] unless he brings
[21:44] mercy and he brought mercy and that was
[21:45] mercy standing before the people
[21:47] for 120 years this generation
[21:51] received the mercy of god in the
[21:52] building of an ark and every day they
[21:54] come by and they said look there's the
[21:56] crazy man noah
[21:58] there's this crazy man out there
[21:59] building a boat but you know what
[22:01] that's what god was giving per mercy to
[22:04] the people
[22:04] he was showing them the plan a way out
[22:08] and you know there were even some people
[22:10] that just got close enough where they
[22:11] just stood on the outside of it because
[22:13] you know they couldn't get themselves
[22:15] in the ark but they got close enough and
[22:17] they thought well you know what if it
[22:18] really starts to rain i'm going to find
[22:19] my way in there
[22:21] but i don't want to get in there because
[22:22] i don't want to look crazy to the world
[22:24] i don't want to look kooky to my friends
[22:26] i don't have to be separated from
[22:28] everybody else i want to be close enough
[22:30] to the world where i can be comfortable
[22:32] but i want to be close enough to god
[22:34] where i got a way out but the problem
[22:37] was
[22:37] was the people that stood by they were
[22:39] close enough and thought they were going
[22:40] to sit on the fence
[22:41] well guess what they died in the flood
[22:43] also
[22:44] you know what you're not going to sit on
[22:46] the fence and think that you're going to
[22:47] get by
[22:48] you're either going to be in the ark or
[22:49] you're going to die there's no other way
[22:51] around it
[22:52] you've got to find your place directly
[22:54] sealed in or you're going to be sealed
[22:56] out there's no other place to be
[22:57] and you know when they when they when
[22:59] noah preached that message to those
[23:01] people
[23:01] you know he just kept going on about his
[23:03] business and he didn't listen
[23:04] to all the fanatics and he didn't listen
[23:06] to all the rigmarole and everything else
[23:08] that went around him all he done was
[23:09] preach the gospel
[23:11] and he went about his job doing what god
[23:13] called him to do
[23:14] and you know you don't have to listen to
[23:15] all what the world has to say and all
[23:17] the naysayers and everything like that
[23:19] you know because if god put something
[23:21] inside of you it don't matter there
[23:22] ain't enough devils in hell it's gonna
[23:24] run it outside of you you're not ever
[23:26] gonna have to
[23:26] worry about is this message right is god
[23:29] right is god real is this message right
[23:31] is the bible right
[23:32] you know do i have a place to stand you
[23:34] know what god healed me will god
[23:36] meet my needs well because if he's ever
[23:38] done it before he'll do it again
[23:43] i don't have to worry about it one
[23:44] because he's healed me before
[23:46] well it's the same it's the same god
[23:47] that's healed us before well you know
[23:49] he's the same god that's delivered us
[23:52] he's the same god that's met all your
[23:54] needs well you know what he's the same
[23:55] one
[23:55] you know what he ain't lost any power
[24:03] god ain't scared about what's going on
[24:06] you know we shouldn't be either you know
[24:09] people worried about
[24:10] what's going to happen in the in in in
[24:12] november what's going to happen with
[24:13] what you know god's god's going to be in
[24:15] control and it don't matter who comes
[24:18] in who goes out what goes up what goes
[24:20] down you know
[24:21] god's still going to be in control you
[24:23] know and the scripture ain't never
[24:25] changing he said
[24:26] i've never seen the righteous forsaken
[24:27] or his seed begging bread
[24:29] and david said i'm i'm old now and he
[24:31] said i was young
[24:32] and he's seen all the things that went
[24:34] through all the valleys and the battles
[24:36] and everything that david had went
[24:37] through in his life
[24:38] and all the things that that he had seen
[24:40] all of the idols and all the things that
[24:42] he had seen
[24:43] in israel and he had seen the anointed
[24:48] the man that god had anointed to be king
[24:52] and you know he was he was a head taller
[24:54] than everybody else
[24:56] he should have been he should have been
[24:57] a great leader but you know what he got
[24:59] to popularity
[25:01] you know he just wanted to be popular he
[25:03] just wanted to do what everybody else
[25:04] said
[25:05] instead of listening to the part to the
[25:07] prophet
[25:08] samuel when the prophet told him what to
[25:10] do
[25:11] he decided he was just going to do
[25:13] whatever he wanted to
[25:16] he wanted he wanted to be and live his
[25:18] own kind of life
[25:20] but he wanted to be close enough to
[25:22] samuel so that he can use samuel's
[25:24] reputation
[25:26] to be his backing
[25:29] you know because you know he wanted he
[25:30] wanted to be close enough that you know
[25:32] that everybody would listen because you
[25:33] know i'm i'm buddies with
[25:35] with samuel you know we're tight but you
[25:38] know what samuel coming had to bring the
[25:40] rebuke to him
[25:41] because he walked away from what god
[25:42] told him to and you know and and there
[25:45] was there was one
[25:46] that god said that he had had one that
[25:49] was after his own heart
[25:50] and all the things that david had seen
[25:52] and you know david
[25:54] wanted to walk in the in the way that
[25:56] god had given him and that was what he
[25:57] said you know
[25:58] that that was what god loved about david
[26:02] even when david done wrong he could
[26:04] admit his wrong
[26:06] you know everything about david he could
[26:07] he could go and
[26:09] and sacrifice and pray to god
[26:12] you know he never got away from god no
[26:14] matter what happened in his life
[26:15] he never turned away from that
[26:20] you know many people you know we can we
[26:22] see so many people that
[26:24] have have tried to get away from that
[26:25] but you know it's just a simple
[26:27] message it's just a simple formula if we
[26:30] can just follow that exact same thing
[26:33] just do what god has for us to do if we
[26:35] just follow god
[26:40] you know when uh
[26:44] even when you know david sinned and
[26:48] you know he had a son
[26:54] you know solomon you know
[26:58] when when solomon came through and he
[27:01] come to be king you know
[27:02] and then solomon when he stepped to the
[27:04] throne you know
[27:06] god asked him you know what what shall i
[27:08] do for you
[27:09] you know that that he had seen the the
[27:13] life of his father and he had seen the
[27:15] things that david had done
[27:17] and you know he stood there being a
[27:19] young man and he said
[27:20] he said lord he said i want an
[27:22] understanding heart
[27:25] he said i want to be able to discern to
[27:27] the people
[27:28] what is right he said lord he said i
[27:31] can't go in or go out
[27:32] he said i don't know he said these are
[27:34] great people before me and he said i'm
[27:36] supposed to be the king
[27:37] and he said i don't even know what to do
[27:40] he said but i want wisdom hey you know i
[27:42] want to know how to judge these people
[27:44] because i'm supposed to be their king
[27:46] you know and it pleased the lord so much
[27:48] that that what solomon asked of him
[27:50] that he said he said because you know he
[27:53] had a such a humble spirit before the
[27:55] lord
[27:55] and the lord said because you've done
[27:57] this because you've had this humble
[27:59] spirit
[28:00] and he said he said you you want to do
[28:02] good to the people
[28:03] he said because you have an
[28:04] understanding desire for understanding
[28:07] he said
[28:07] you will receive those things he said
[28:09] you will have wisdom he said you'll have
[28:11] a spirit of discernment
[28:13] to work before the people and he said
[28:15] because you've done this and he said
[28:16] you've not asked
[28:17] for for long life or riches or the lives
[28:20] of your enemies or anything like that he
[28:22] said because you've done that he said
[28:23] you will have those things
[28:25] all the other things you will have
[28:27] because what did jesus say he said if
[28:29] you seek first
[28:30] the kingdom of god he said then his
[28:32] righteousness all these other things
[28:33] will be added unto you
[28:34] but solomon walked out there and you
[28:36] know when and brother i said that was a
[28:38] type of the millennium in the in the
[28:39] in the days of israel because you know
[28:41] there was no war
[28:43] you know it had such great uh wisdom and
[28:46] understanding and all of and all of the
[28:48] aspects of the kingdom that you know
[28:50] what there was nobody that wanted to
[28:52] fight israel
[28:53] well because they were such a fortified
[28:55] group such a fortified kingdom that
[28:57] nobody wanted to take on solomon
[28:59] and solomon had such wisdom because god
[29:01] had given him
[29:02] that power of discernment he knew how to
[29:04] handle situations
[29:05] and he knew how to handle things he knew
[29:07] what to do and you know
[29:08] because it became so great because he
[29:11] had this
[29:12] desire to be humble and speak before the
[29:14] lord and had this desire to please the
[29:16] lord and what he done
[29:17] that when he went to go forth then we
[29:19] know that the scripture talks about the
[29:21] queen of the south or the queen of sheba
[29:23] that she
[29:23] came because she had heard of the the
[29:26] ministry
[29:27] of the of the knowledge and the
[29:29] understanding of king solomon
[29:31] that she desired to come see what what
[29:34] god had done
[29:35] because you know she had in her foreign
[29:37] country you know she had heard
[29:39] many people come to her country and tell
[29:42] her what a great god
[29:43] that israel had and a great king they
[29:46] had
[29:46] in solomon and you know she kept hearing
[29:49] this being
[29:50] preached all the time and you know she
[29:52] had such a desire
[29:53] that she gave up everything she had to
[29:55] go find him
[29:57] she had to go find him and hear these
[29:59] things and you know brother brown talks
[30:00] about you know she went on this journey
[30:02] it was like three months and
[30:03] you know she had to go through all of
[30:04] these pestilences
[30:06] and you know she had to deal with
[30:09] robbers and
[30:10] you know all of these dangerous
[30:11] situations that she had to go through
[30:13] but she had a desire
[30:14] to hear the word of the lord and she
[30:16] went through all of those things
[30:18] to face all those all those things that
[30:21] she didn't even know what she was going
[30:22] to face on that journey
[30:24] and then she took all of the all of the
[30:25] riches and everything that she had with
[30:27] her and you know she was a she was a
[30:28] mark if there ever was one
[30:30] to be struck by all of those robbers and
[30:33] everything
[30:33] that were lit you know the highway men
[30:35] and everything that was that during
[30:36] those times
[30:37] but you know she had a desire to hear
[30:39] from the word
[30:40] and to hear what god had done because
[30:42] she had only heard about it but she
[30:43] wanted to see for herself
[30:45] she had a desire to receive for herself
[30:47] and you know
[30:48] and she went and she went in there and
[30:50] then she said when she got there
[30:51] and she heard solomon speak and she
[30:53] heard those things and she said it's
[30:55] even greater than what i heard
[30:57] from all these people have tried to
[30:58] testify to me of what goodness it was
[31:01] and how great it was and now come to
[31:03] find out it's even better than what i've
[31:05] heard
[31:06] well let me tell you something brothers
[31:07] and sisters we can stand here we can
[31:09] tell you how good it is
[31:10] and we can tell you about living in the
[31:11] land of the living and we can tell you
[31:13] about living in the in canaan and we can
[31:15] tell you all about the milk and the
[31:16] honey and everything like
[31:18] that but until you come into this land
[31:19] you'll never know about it
[31:21] we can't tell you about it we can't
[31:22] paint a picture good enough we can't
[31:24] tell you about it but when you get in
[31:26] here you'll find out
[31:27] it's better than you ever thought it
[31:28] would be
[31:30] it'll be greater than you ever thought
[31:32] it would be
[31:34] but you know the greatest thing is she
[31:36] went through all that and he
[31:37] and jesus said that she would rise up in
[31:39] the last days and she would
[31:41] she would be a condemnation to the
[31:42] people because he said behold a greater
[31:44] than solomon is here
[31:46] and so greater is he that is here today
[31:48] than he was back then
[31:50] amen
[31:55] it's great but you know what people
[31:58] can't humble themselves
[32:01] people have missed out on the humility
[32:07] oh goodness he's so great
[32:17] that we can we can see how great it is
[32:21] if we can just you know we just trust
[32:23] the lord and he can show
[32:24] and we say well this is so good well you
[32:26] know what there's more goodness there
[32:28] there's more goodness you know as
[32:30] brother brown talked about that
[32:31] fella eating uh eating a watermelon he
[32:33] said you know he said
[32:34] this sure is good but he said there's
[32:36] more of it you know
[32:37] we we can feast on the things of god but
[32:39] you know what you keep digging in there
[32:41] you'll find out there's a lot more good
[32:42] things in there
[32:43] you know it just it just gets better and
[32:45] better and better
[32:49] you know as we were
[32:52] as a as the first quote that i was
[32:53] reading there were brother and speaking
[32:55] of
[32:55] of john when when john came and you know
[32:59] the scripture talks about you know
[33:00] making all the high places low and and
[33:03] the low places
[33:04] high and making the all the crooked
[33:06] places straight and everything
[33:07] you know people are so amazed by by what
[33:10] the scripture said by isaiah talking
[33:11] about
[33:12] how everything was going to be a certain
[33:13] way and and everything and you know
[33:15] people were just so amazed they they sat
[33:17] there and
[33:17] you know they were looking for some
[33:18] great thing to take place and you know
[33:20] you know their whole time looking at the
[33:22] sky and boy they were just waiting for
[33:24] some
[33:24] great momentous occasion that was going
[33:26] to take place and it was going to change
[33:28] everything and everybody was going to be
[33:29] looking at this
[33:30] this marvelous majestic thing to take
[33:33] place
[33:35] and when it took place they missed it
[33:38] why because it was it was so humble
[33:43] they missed it
[33:46] and we know that when john the baptist
[33:48] came
[33:50] you know he was not he was not like
[33:53] anybody expected him to be
[33:56] you know here's here's a man that was
[33:57] living out in the world looked like some
[33:59] woolly booger coming out of the woods
[34:00] and you know just living in and you know
[34:03] having a having
[34:04] camel hair and you know eating bugs and
[34:07] you know all kinds of stuff you know he
[34:09] didn't look like nobody that god would
[34:11] ever speak to
[34:12] he wouldn't look like nobody that
[34:13] anybody that had any right sense in
[34:14] their mind
[34:15] would even talk to but he was the one
[34:17] that came out there in the power
[34:19] of the holy ghost and began to speak to
[34:21] the people he said to repent
[34:23] that the the the messiah was at hand
[34:27] you know now is the time and
[34:31] in john chapter one
[34:34] verse 25 and he said and they asked him
[34:37] and said unto him
[34:38] why baptize us thou then if thou
[34:41] if thou be not that christ or elias
[34:44] neither that prophet
[34:45] john answered said sin i baptize with
[34:47] water but there
[34:48] standeth one among you whom you know not
[34:51] it is
[34:52] he it is whom cometh after me is
[34:55] preferred before me whose shoes latch it
[34:58] i am not worthy to unloose
[35:00] these things were done in bashir beyond
[35:02] jordan where john was baptizing
[35:06] bethel borough and the next day
[35:09] john sith jesus coming unto him and
[35:11] saith behold the lamb of god which take
[35:13] away the sin of the world
[35:14] this is he of whom i said after me
[35:17] cometh a man which is
[35:18] preferred before me for he was before me
[35:21] and i knew him not but
[35:22] that he should be made manifest israel
[35:25] therefore am i come baptizing with water
[35:28] and john bear records saying i saw the
[35:30] spirit descending from heaven like a
[35:31] dove
[35:32] and abode upon him and i knew him not
[35:36] but he that went but he that sent me to
[35:39] baptize with water
[35:40] the same said unto me upon whom thou
[35:43] shalt see the spirit descending and
[35:45] remaining on him
[35:46] the same is he which baptized us with
[35:48] the holy ghost and i saw and bear record
[35:51] that this is the son of god
[35:55] so you know
[36:00] here he is you know john coming out
[36:02] there and began to speak to the people
[36:03] and he began to identify the
[36:05] the old testament prophets and the
[36:08] ministry that he had
[36:09] of the one voice crying in the
[36:10] wilderness and then identifying himself
[36:13] that he was the forerun
[36:14] the coming of christ the coming of the
[36:16] messiah and he began to speak to the
[36:18] people
[36:18] and you know people a lot of people
[36:20] didn't understand what he was saying but
[36:21] you know there was something that struck
[36:23] the people
[36:23] that they began to listen to him and
[36:25] people that were humble enough to come
[36:27] to hear what he had to say
[36:29] because many people had heard what the
[36:31] old testament you know the scribes and
[36:32] the pharisees and the prophets and all
[36:34] the different ones
[36:35] had heard all those different things
[36:36] they'd been told all those things
[36:38] and you know the priests had had made
[36:40] their sermons and all those things
[36:41] knowing what the prophets had said but
[36:43] you know what when they began to see
[36:45] that
[36:45] it was so humble that people just walked
[36:47] past it they didn't agree with that they
[36:49] didn't
[36:49] there was nothing in that but you know
[36:51] it caught the attention of some people
[36:53] and they began to listen
[36:55] and they began to see what things that
[36:57] john spoke
[36:58] and when jesus came then he said i saw
[37:01] the spirit of heaven
[37:02] the spirit of god come down like a dove
[37:04] and lay upon this one
[37:06] and he stayed and it bowed upon him why
[37:09] because he had the spirit
[37:10] of a lamb because he was the lamb of god
[37:13] because you know
[37:14] the spirit the dove can only stay where
[37:16] the lamb spirit is because they have the
[37:18] same nature
[37:18] so you know he had to stay there and he
[37:20] saw that take place
[37:22] but then you know then he began to
[37:23] preach and you know it was time for
[37:25] jesus to come on the scene
[37:27] and you know jesus john said you know i
[37:29] must decrease
[37:30] that he might increase why because he
[37:32] began to preach
[37:33] and point to people that was all his job
[37:35] was was to point people
[37:37] to jesus to show who the messiah was and
[37:40] this is the fulfillment of the scripture
[37:42] now i'm supposed to walk off the scene
[37:44] but you know people wanted to follow
[37:46] john
[37:46] and john was trying to point to him and
[37:48] say that's the one
[37:49] that's the one but people were still
[37:51] looking at john trying to figure out
[37:53] where you know well he's the one that's
[37:54] fulfilling the scripture he's the
[37:56] prophet
[37:56] but the prophet we kept pointing to
[37:58] people look back look at him he's the
[38:00] one you must follow now
[38:02] amen even when john john lost his vision
[38:05] and couldn't see
[38:06] you know he still went and you know they
[38:08] sent word back to john to tell who that
[38:10] jesus told him
[38:11] said yes i am the one i am the one
[38:14] that even when he lost he lost his
[38:16] vision when brother graham said his
[38:17] eagle eye got filmed over but you know
[38:19] it was still
[38:19] he was pointing the people to jesus
[38:23] and the people were supposed to see
[38:24] jesus
[38:26] and you know and here and you know
[38:28] here's the humility and
[38:30] the in the forerunner of jesus and then
[38:32] you see the humility in jesus when he
[38:34] came
[38:35] because he was you know if he was what
[38:37] the scripture
[38:38] said because he was god made manifest in
[38:44] flesh
[38:46] and many people you know they began to
[38:48] look in the scripture go well
[38:50] they expected him to come just like they
[38:52] expected john to come
[38:53] they expected this this great role you
[38:55] know these great stairs to come down
[38:57] from heaven and he was supposed to come
[38:58] and they were supposed to have all these
[39:00] angels playing trumpets and all this
[39:01] great
[39:02] fanfare and all these things was
[39:03] supposed to take place but the scripture
[39:05] never told us that jesus would come that
[39:07] way
[39:08] that was that was the man's idea he
[39:10] never did say that he would come that
[39:12] way
[39:12] because he never comes in man's great
[39:14] idea of greatness but he came in the
[39:16] greatness that god says is great
[39:18] and so he came why because he came from
[39:21] the
[39:22] ramparts of glory he become he came from
[39:24] the greatness
[39:25] and he and he made himself and he
[39:26] humbled himself down to become as a baby
[39:29] why because
[39:29] he had to come and fulfill the scripture
[39:32] that was written of him that he had to
[39:33] come
[39:34] and be just like you and i he had to
[39:36] come born of a virgin
[39:37] and he had to come and he had to walk
[39:39] and talk and just do all the same things
[39:41] that you have to do
[39:42] he had to know what it was like to feel
[39:44] pain and feel hunger and feel
[39:48] rejection and all the other things that
[39:50] he had to go through in his life
[39:51] and deal with all those things that he
[39:53] had to face why because that was what's
[39:54] written of him
[39:56] he had to go through those things that
[39:57] he can be a high priest
[39:59] that can be touched by the feelings of
[40:00] our infirmities to know what we go
[40:02] through in this life
[40:05] and you know what he faced all the same
[40:06] things that you face he knows what it's
[40:08] like to be rejected
[40:10] he knows what it's like to be hungry and
[40:12] cold and miserable
[40:13] and all these different things and be
[40:14] bombarded by the spirits of
[40:17] the devil and you know having him speak
[40:19] to you and you know he had to be
[40:21] bombarded by that but you know what he
[40:23] overcame every single time the devil
[40:25] tried to overcome with him
[40:26] even when he was in his weakness and you
[40:28] know he was tired and he was hungry and
[40:30] all those different things and the devil
[40:31] was tempting him but you know what he
[40:33] still used the word of god to overcome
[40:35] you know because brother and sister we
[40:37] have the word and we can overcome also
[40:39] god has given us the word that we can
[40:41] overcome
[40:46] and here's here's this great king that
[40:49] came
[40:50] and he came to walk just like you and i
[40:52] do walk in
[40:53] and and and face the same things that
[40:56] that you and i do
[40:58] but you know what he he had he had to
[41:00] walk
[41:01] and he was obedient in all those things
[41:06] he said he was obedient unto death even
[41:08] the death of the cross
[41:11] you know that was hard you know that was
[41:14] that was a real struggle
[41:17] one because you know there was there was
[41:19] a part of him that didn't want to die
[41:21] there was a part of him they didn't want
[41:22] to have to go through that
[41:24] but you know what he still he said not
[41:25] my will but thine lord
[41:29] and here he was and he walks out there
[41:31] and he had in the last supper when he
[41:33] was there and he was gathered with his
[41:34] disciples
[41:37] you know he's standing there and he and
[41:38] he gathers gathers them together gathers
[41:41] them together you know and he's standing
[41:43] there and he's talking to him you know
[41:44] because he's getting ready to leave them
[41:48] you know this is going to be the one of
[41:50] the last times that he
[41:51] has fellowship with them and he wants
[41:53] them to know
[41:54] you know just like he told peter he said
[41:56] he said this devil has desired
[41:59] to shift sift you like wheat
[42:02] but he said he said but i've prayed for
[42:04] you
[42:05] and he said he said and when you're
[42:06] converted strengthen your brethren
[42:09] that's right man isn't that isn't that
[42:12] encouraging
[42:15] even even though what he knew all the
[42:16] things that peter would do
[42:18] that peter would deny all the things
[42:20] that peter would do and yet
[42:22] you know what god still had jesus still
[42:24] had love for
[42:25] and he knew that he would use him he
[42:27] still had a ministry for him to
[42:29] and all the and all the all of his
[42:31] faults and failures but you know
[42:32] he went in there and he broke the bread
[42:34] and he spoke to him and you know even
[42:36] even in the midst of all of that you
[42:38] know he took a towel and he girded
[42:39] himself and he went in there
[42:40] and he washed the disciples feet the
[42:43] king of glory
[42:44] that washed washed his disciples feet
[42:46] even washing judas's feet
[42:48] who he knew that he would betray him
[42:50] that all that he would do to him and you
[42:52] know what he went in there and he washed
[42:53] their feet
[42:54] and he went in there and he said he said
[42:55] look he said i am your master and your
[42:58] lord he said you know look look at the
[43:00] position that i have
[43:01] but he said i want to show you that i
[43:03] have that i have a servant's heart
[43:05] and he said you ought to have a
[43:06] servant's heart also he said if i washed
[43:08] your feet
[43:09] and show you these things he said you
[43:11] ought to wash one another's feet he said
[43:13] you ought to be a servitude unto each
[43:15] other
[43:16] he said you ought to not think one is
[43:18] better than the other but he said you
[43:19] should all
[43:20] think highly of each other and he said
[43:22] you should all have this servant it's
[43:24] hard to do these things
[43:25] and you know he went in there and he and
[43:26] he showed these things and he and he
[43:28] told
[43:28] told them listen listen i'm going to go
[43:30] through these things but he said i'm not
[43:32] going to leave you comfortless
[43:33] he said i'm not going to leave you by
[43:35] yourself he said i want to show you one
[43:37] thing i'm going to tell you
[43:38] he said i've told you before he said
[43:40] that i told you when we were standing on
[43:42] the
[43:42] on the mountain and looking over the
[43:44] temple and i told you he said you can
[43:46] tear this temple down in three days
[43:48] he said but in three days i'll raise it
[43:50] up he said you can tear it down but he
[43:52] said i have the power to raise it up
[43:54] and he said i'm gonna raise it back up
[43:55] and you know they were so distraught
[43:57] when he pat when he died and everything
[43:59] you know they got and then you know they
[44:00] walked away from him and peter went
[44:02] fishing and all the other things that
[44:04] they'd done
[44:04] oh god got so gloomy and went all their
[44:06] different ways but you know
[44:08] jesus came back and told him he said
[44:10] this is that's not what exactly what i
[44:12] told you would take place
[44:14] i told you i was going to do this but
[44:15] i'm bringing you back
[44:17] and he told him he said but listen he
[44:19] said i told you what would take place
[44:20] but he said i want you to do
[44:22] one thing he said i want you go to the
[44:24] city of jerusalem
[44:25] he said i want you to go there and he
[44:27] said i want you to go in the upper room
[44:28] and i said i want you to stay there he
[44:30] said until you're endued with power from
[44:31] on high
[44:32] he said i've given you the promise that
[44:34] you go and he said when are these days
[44:36] he said because i go away he said but
[44:38] i'm going to send the comforter back to
[44:40] you
[44:40] and the comforter is going to lead you
[44:42] and guide you into all truth
[44:43] the comfort is going to show you all
[44:46] these things that i've spoken to you are
[44:47] true
[44:48] and you're going to see these things in
[44:49] a supernatural way
[44:51] and he began to speak to these people
[44:53] and then then when he went up in the
[44:54] when he
[44:55] descen ascended you know then he told
[44:57] him you go and wait
[44:58] you go terry you know
[45:01] and they waited well they had to be
[45:03] humble enough to go sit in a room
[45:05] looking at each other wondering what was
[45:06] going to take place because you know
[45:08] even when when the the romans thought
[45:11] that somebody had stolen jesus's body
[45:13] and you know they were wondering what
[45:14] was going on and they're all afraid
[45:16] hiding out worried about everything
[45:18] and staring at each other and wondering
[45:19] what was going to take place but you
[45:20] know what
[45:21] they were like well you know are we
[45:22] waiting long enough have we waited you
[45:24] know how many days are we supposed to
[45:25] wait how many days has it been it's been
[45:27] a week we still ain't got nothing
[45:30] but you got to wait you got to tarry
[45:34] you know what the thing is is when you
[45:36] tarry you don't have to when you when
[45:38] the holy spirit comes you don't have to
[45:39] guess if it came or not
[45:42] you know when they when they received it
[45:44] on the day of pentecost you know what
[45:45] they didn't have to
[45:46] did you feel something you know because
[45:49] it was something that quickened them
[45:51] that it quickened the word to them that
[45:53] you know what they didn't have to worry
[45:54] about if it was something that really
[45:55] happened to them or not
[45:56] it's like oh i felt a tingle did you
[45:59] feel something
[46:01] no you know it took away all the doubt
[46:03] he took away all the confusion
[46:05] he took away all the fear why because
[46:07] the spirit of god had come
[46:08] and it became real to them and it became
[46:11] in them and then all of a sudden then
[46:13] they could walk out the door
[46:14] like drunk men and begin to preach as
[46:16] peter began to preach to those people
[46:18] and tell you that it's not you know it's
[46:20] not about the third hour of the day
[46:23] and he said we're not drunk these people
[46:24] aren't drunk like you think they are
[46:26] but let me tell you something this is
[46:28] the fulfillment of the prophet joel
[46:30] joel prophet prophesied of this and now
[46:33] you're seeing the fulfillment of this
[46:34] and we're going to tell you that the
[46:36] jesus of nazareth whom some of you heard
[46:38] and
[46:38] couldn't follow but you know what this
[46:41] is that what he spoke of
[46:43] that that he would come and they were
[46:44] going to begin to speak of what jesus
[46:47] done
[46:47] of the of the the prophets and
[46:49] everything that they had preached
[46:50] in the past and to come to this very
[46:53] single day
[46:54] and it tells you this is the day that
[46:56] jesus
[46:57] jesus of nazareth has come and now he is
[47:00] the same the lord and the christ
[47:03] when he began to preach this message to
[47:05] him you know it stirred the people so
[47:07] much
[47:07] that they want to know what what they
[47:09] had to do to get the same thing that
[47:11] that peter had
[47:16] it wasn't some well i think about it
[47:20] can i come back tomorrow no if something
[47:23] to grab grip
[47:24] these people so much that when they want
[47:26] to what are we supposed to do
[47:27] peter what are we supposed to do ben and
[47:30] brethren what is it that we need to do
[47:31] and he said you need to repent
[47:34] you need to be converted you need to
[47:35] change he said you need to repent and be
[47:38] baptized in the name of jesus christ
[47:40] for the remission of your sins and he
[47:42] said you shall receive the gift of the
[47:43] holy ghost
[47:44] you shall receive the gift of eternal
[47:46] life he said because this
[47:48] promise is made unto you and to your
[47:51] children and to them that's a far off
[47:53] even as many as the lord our god shall
[47:54] call so it's
[47:56] you know it still is today is he's still
[47:58] calling today
[47:59] he's still the same one today he still
[48:02] has the same power
[48:03] he is the same one and you know he is
[48:05] still preaching the same thing today
[48:07] through the five-fold ministry that he's
[48:09] still speaking that if you
[48:11] have a desire you can repent and be
[48:13] baptized in the name of jesus christ and
[48:15] you know what in the same thing
[48:17] he said the same antidote still works
[48:18] today as it ever has you can receive the
[48:21] exact same thing that they received on
[48:22] the day of pentecost
[48:24] yes sir
[48:28] but people have gotten away from that
[48:31] they've gotten away from
[48:33] just this humble humble word of god
[48:36] that god has spoken
[48:39] that god has spoke to people that's just
[48:41] so simple
[48:42] if you can humble yourself too
[48:51] and and
[48:56] you know there was one that came after
[48:59] this and
[49:01] many people have one of the things i was
[49:05] i've been looking at is you know people
[49:06] have been
[49:08] they look and and you know brother brown
[49:10] talked about
[49:11] had a had a man come to him and and he
[49:14] said well what you're doing is all right
[49:15] brother branham said but you're uh
[49:17] he said what you're trying to do is
[49:18] preach an apostolic age
[49:20] he said you know the apostolic age
[49:22] ceased many years ago
[49:23] he said you know all that's over with we
[49:25] don't we don't need all that stuff today
[49:27] you know we don't we don't need what you
[49:28] know what took place back there
[49:30] and he said it was just for the apostles
[49:33] it was just for the apostles he's like
[49:34] uh which which ones were the twelve that
[49:36] were deal with jesus you know that was
[49:38] the only ones that
[49:39] that received this thing you know and he
[49:40] said well really is that true
[49:42] yes well he said well then peter must or
[49:44] paul was out
[49:47] paul didn't say paul didn't see jesus in
[49:49] the flesh
[49:50] he didn't he didn't walk with him he
[49:52] didn't talk he didn't handle him he
[49:54] didn't have the he didn't have the
[49:55] testimony that peter and them had
[49:57] but you know what he knew him by
[49:58] revelation he had received a revelation
[50:01] you know as as all the things that he
[50:03] had done you know he had studied all of
[50:05] his life he had studied
[50:06] the the word he had studied the the law
[50:09] and all those things he knew everything
[50:11] that all the things that the prophets
[50:12] had said he knew all the
[50:14] the writings of moses he knew everything
[50:16] you could you know he could tell you all
[50:18] about it he understood everything
[50:20] you know he walked he walked a perfect
[50:21] religious life he knew exactly how to do
[50:24] everything
[50:24] and you know he was he was a pharisee of
[50:26] the pharisees i mean you know
[50:28] he had a great a great master teacher
[50:30] that taught him everything
[50:31] and he knew everything and you know he
[50:33] was such he had such a zeal to do the
[50:35] work of god that he was going out there
[50:37] and he was going to kill all these
[50:38] heretics
[50:39] but you know what he got he got on the
[50:41] road one day
[50:43] and god met him and you know what all
[50:46] the teaching that he had had
[50:48] and all the schooling that he had had
[50:50] and all the theology in him you know
[50:52] what he had
[50:52] he had a use for that but you know what
[50:55] because when
[50:56] when paul had the holy ghost then you
[50:59] know what he could go back
[51:00] and he had read all the scrolls and he
[51:01] had read all those things but let me
[51:03] tell you what when the holy ghost
[51:04] anointed
[51:05] paul's eyes that he could read the
[51:07] scripture and he went back and started
[51:08] reading and now he could realize
[51:10] that jesus christ is the messiah and
[51:12] here's all the things and showing
[51:13] how christ was all through the old
[51:15] testament how all those things how he
[51:17] could sit down
[51:18] and he could write and he could write
[51:19] the new testament to the church and tell
[51:21] everybody
[51:22] look at these things and these are the
[51:23] things that took place in the old
[51:25] testament and here i'll hear how it all
[51:27] lays out
[51:30] you know he had a great ministry that
[51:32] that god could do for him
[51:34] god could use him but you know what he
[51:36] had he had to
[51:37] blind him so that he could have sight
[51:40] right
[51:40] he had to he had to make him had to put
[51:42] him down on the on the road
[51:44] so that he could make him humble so god
[51:46] could speak to him and then he
[51:48] wanted to know who are you lord
[51:51] he said i'm jesus whom thou persecuted
[51:53] us
[51:54] then he knew who he was then he could
[51:56] look in the scripture and know
[51:58] that and then paul could raise up and
[52:00] say paul
[52:01] a servant of jesus christ paul a
[52:04] prisoner of jesus christ
[52:06] he knew who he was and he knew where he
[52:08] came from and he knew all those things
[52:09] that he had been taught all his years
[52:11] and he said you know i count all that as
[52:13] dung
[52:13] he said you know because all that
[52:15] theology and all those things it doesn't
[52:17] mean anything
[52:17] he said but i'm that i might know him
[52:19] and in the power of his resurrection
[52:22] that he could see he said it wasn't just
[52:24] that there was no count that all the
[52:26] things that he had studied and he had
[52:27] learned but it was through the holy
[52:28] ghost that could quicken what he had
[52:30] studied and he had read
[52:31] but if it was just going to be man-made
[52:33] theology it was just going to be
[52:34] man-made ideas
[52:35] he didn't do any many good and it just
[52:38] it's not going to do us any good either
[52:39] to
[52:40] to just study the scripture and study
[52:42] the message and just hold it
[52:43] if it doesn't become quick and by the
[52:45] holy ghost it does us no good
[52:47] you can hold it you can read it and you
[52:49] know there's many people
[52:50] and there's many preachers that have
[52:51] stood behind the pulpits and you know
[52:53] they can take this scripture and they
[52:55] can put it together and they can put
[52:56] quotes together and they can do many
[52:58] things but you know what if it doesn't
[52:59] have the holy ghost behind it
[53:01] if it's not the holy ghost leading you
[53:04] on the way
[53:05] and bringing the word to the people then
[53:06] it doesn't do any good
[53:08] because you know it doesn't do us any
[53:09] good to try to preach our own ideas
[53:11] if it's not if you're trying to build a
[53:13] kingdom to yourself if you're trying to
[53:15] bring people to you
[53:16] and not to christ it doesn't do any good
[53:22] and all the things that paul had seen
[53:26] and done and he had a great ministry and
[53:28] the great miracles that god had worked
[53:30] through him
[53:31] and all the people that had had seen
[53:33] paul work
[53:34] and seen the ministry that paul had and
[53:36] people that flocked to him
[53:38] and you know they wanted to be around
[53:39] paul and it's like oh do you see what
[53:41] god's done
[53:42] with paul and all these great things and
[53:44] you know people just wanted to gather
[53:45] around him
[53:46] people were so drawn to him
[53:50] but you know there became a change in
[53:51] paul
[53:53] you know you know there was a
[53:58] change went through in his life and you
[54:00] know people didn't hang around him
[54:02] anymore
[54:03] you know as he began to hang to the word
[54:05] and and you know he
[54:06] he wasn't he wasn't doing the same
[54:08] things as he was before and
[54:10] you know he become humble unto the word
[54:12] of god and
[54:13] you know demas was there and you know
[54:15] demas just loved paul when he was
[54:17] doing the great miracles and he had a
[54:19] lot of a lot of things and you know
[54:21] a lot of a lot of flash and you know
[54:23] different things god was
[54:25] moving and there was great things taking
[54:26] place it's like oh boy you know
[54:28] i can't i just can't wait to be here but
[54:31] you know there came a time
[54:32] when paul got separated when god
[54:35] separated him from the people
[54:38] you know he had a he had a ministry that
[54:40] he had to walk away
[54:42] and he just hung to the word
[54:46] you know and and paul writing in the in
[54:49] the in the scripture there when he was
[54:50] writing and he said you know
[54:51] demas has forsaken me
[54:55] you know demas was so close to him they
[54:57] were close and you know all those things
[54:58] and then he writes
[55:01] demas loving this present world
[55:06] he said he has forsaken me and no doubt
[55:10] that was a heartbreaking thing
[55:11] for paul to write that that paul had to
[55:14] write that and talk about demas
[55:16] well you know brother branham said demas
[55:18] didn't go out and go to the honky tonks
[55:20] he wasn't in the brothels he wasn't he
[55:22] wasn't up and down the road with
[55:24] everybody else he wasn't out there in
[55:25] the world doing all the things that that
[55:26] he had walked away from
[55:28] when he loved this present world there
[55:30] was a thing brother branham said that he
[55:32] had popularity
[55:33] he he liked the popular things he liked
[55:35] being popular he liked
[55:36] he liked rubbing elbows and shoulders
[55:38] with with the high-class people and you
[55:40] know having a great name and everything
[55:42] and when when paul realized you know i
[55:44] don't need that that's that's not the
[55:45] life of god
[55:46] i can you know because i just want to be
[55:48] as just me and him and to be humble
[55:51] and be the servant of god and you know
[55:54] he just walked away from things
[55:56] and it's like well paul's lost his
[56:00] ministry
[56:01] he's lost the power you know he used to
[56:03] speak to people
[56:04] and and things would happen to him and
[56:06] now he just turns around walks off
[56:09] and he just he just don't fellowship
[56:11] with people
[56:12] he's like oh i can't i can't have
[56:14] anything to do with this
[56:16] why because demas demas was there when
[56:18] it was all good and everything was
[56:20] looking good
[56:21] but when it became that it had to be
[56:23] walk in humility
[56:25] walking in the hum and in just a humble
[56:28] christian life that
[56:29] paul had you know demons had to leave
[56:32] and you know many people that's the way
[56:34] it is you know it's it's popularity you
[56:36] know
[56:36] it's like well i i you know i don't want
[56:38] to be here because you know they're
[56:40] you know they do certain things and and
[56:42] you know they don't have a big crowd and
[56:44] you know
[56:44] they don't have this and that and you
[56:46] know it just don't suit my fancy you
[56:48] know i want to go where you know i can i
[56:50] i feel i feel more i fit in better over
[56:53] here you know i i feel better
[56:55] you know i like things better over there
[56:56] why because they want to be where it's
[56:57] popular
[56:59] you know many people they they want to
[57:01] go where you know that big crowds and
[57:03] different things but you know what the
[57:04] problem is is they don't even know
[57:05] what's being preached
[57:10] are you are you walking in
[57:14] in humility are you walking in the
[57:15] humbleness that god has
[57:17] are you walking to be great in him not
[57:19] with great with people
[57:23] you know he had had seen all these
[57:25] things and and you know
[57:28] paul just wanted to be he just wanted to
[57:31] be
[57:32] a prisoner of jesus christ he just
[57:34] wanted to be humble
[57:35] and do the same do the things that jesus
[57:38] wanted him to do
[57:39] to live that humble life and you know
[57:42] that's the thing is you know because
[57:44] so many people they want to they want to
[57:46] be in the eyes of the people
[57:48] they want they want to have they want to
[57:50] have commendations of the people
[57:52] they want to have honor with the people
[57:55] they want to be they want to be
[57:56] pressed have prestige and all these
[57:58] different things paul said he didn't
[57:59] care about any of those things
[58:01] if i if i can just be pleasing to god
[58:04] that's all that matters
[58:05] i just want to be pleasing to god i
[58:07] don't have to have a i don't have to
[58:08] have a big name
[58:09] i don't have to have that people know me
[58:11] or anything he said but i just want to
[58:13] be pleasing to god i just want
[58:14] to live the life that god has called me
[58:17] to i want to be
[58:18] faithful to the work that god has called
[58:20] me to you know i don't have to
[58:22] um as paul talked about you know
[58:26] you know just living a humble simple
[58:28] life and you know and he said he said
[58:29] you know
[58:30] i didn't come begging money from you and
[58:32] he said i didn't get my living from you
[58:34] and all these things he said you know he
[58:35] said i've learned to be in whatever
[58:38] state i am
[58:38] there with to be content you know and
[58:41] you realize all the things that
[58:42] he wrote to the people and he didn't
[58:44] write a bunch of stuff to the church to
[58:46] tell people
[58:46] that that he wanted them to feel sorry
[58:48] for him i have a pity party
[58:50] he wanted them to know what he's done
[58:52] for the gospel
[58:53] this is what god's brought me through he
[58:55] said he said you know he said i spent
[58:57] i went through shipwreck and he said i
[58:59] spent a day in the night in the deep
[59:01] and he said he said i've been in barrels
[59:02] he said i've been stoned he said i've
[59:04] been beaten he said i've been in prison
[59:06] all these different things that he's
[59:07] went through in his life all the things
[59:08] that he had
[59:09] that he had faced in his life and he
[59:11] said you know he said
[59:12] it's the glory to god he said it's not
[59:14] in me but he said it's glory to the god
[59:16] but
[59:16] but look at all the things that i've
[59:18] went through he said you know he said
[59:20] but i consider myself
[59:21] to be the least in the kingdom and all
[59:24] the things that he had been through
[59:25] and you know he said i do it all for the
[59:27] glory of the lord he said but i don't
[59:28] want you to feel sorry for me
[59:30] he said because god called me to do
[59:32] these things and it's been the
[59:34] grace of god that's brought me through
[59:36] but i want you to know that this is
[59:37] something that's real to me
[59:39] and this is what god's brought me
[59:40] through and he's carried me through
[59:42] these things and he said i want to
[59:43] i want to show you that that you know i
[59:45] god called me to be
[59:46] the the apostle to the gentiles and you
[59:48] know i'm here to carry this gospel
[59:50] from wherever i can to let the people
[59:52] know and you know whatever happens to me
[59:54] it happens to me but you know it's all
[59:56] for the grace of god
[59:59] and it's amazing that all the things
[1:00:01] that he went through but you know he
[1:00:02] counted all glory to god
[1:00:05] and it wasn't it wasn't that he wanted
[1:00:06] to build a name for himself or or
[1:00:08] anything like that but he wanted
[1:00:09] he wanted to show people that that you
[1:00:11] know all the things that he had been
[1:00:12] through what this is my testimony this
[1:00:14] is what god's brought me through
[1:00:17] you know and that's the way it is you
[1:00:19] and i we we can raise up and and be
[1:00:21] great in the sight of god and
[1:00:22] great in the kingdom of god and do the
[1:00:24] things that are god that god has called
[1:00:26] us to do
[1:00:27] you know if we god has called us to do
[1:00:29] the greater works then the greater works
[1:00:31] is to believe on them that
[1:00:32] that he has sent you know that he has
[1:00:34] called these people you know and it
[1:00:36] doesn't matter if you know
[1:00:37] your left hand from your right hand or
[1:00:38] if you know up from down or if you know
[1:00:40] anything but if you know
[1:00:41] jesus christ if you know jesus christ in
[1:00:44] the new birth
[1:00:45] if you know if you've been born again if
[1:00:47] you've been sealed in
[1:00:48] to the body that's all that matters it
[1:00:50] doesn't matter if you know anything else
[1:00:52] because many people they want to know
[1:00:55] you know
[1:00:55] that you know they get so wrapped up in
[1:00:57] so many other things
[1:01:00] but you know and and we we see so many
[1:01:02] people that that when it comes down
[1:01:04] and we see people that that have gotten
[1:01:06] to this place and you know
[1:01:07] if if you can just wait on god
[1:01:10] if you can just be humble enough before
[1:01:12] god that god can reveal to you
[1:01:15] this word and that god opens up many
[1:01:18] people say well you know
[1:01:20] you know what brother i'm speaking on
[1:01:22] the trial and you know what he was
[1:01:23] talking about you know they come doing
[1:01:24] well you know i waited long enough you
[1:01:25] know i waited this many days
[1:01:27] x number of years and everything god
[1:01:28] ain't never done this for me ain't never
[1:01:30] done me he ain't never healed me ain't
[1:01:31] never
[1:01:31] well you know what you still got to wait
[1:01:35] you need to tarry you need to wait on
[1:01:37] god it did god didn't say but you know
[1:01:39] what it becomes when you humble yourself
[1:01:41] many times people waiting on god to do
[1:01:43] something the problem is is they've not
[1:01:44] humbled themselves
[1:01:46] they've not got humble enough and you
[1:01:48] know just like brother branham was
[1:01:49] talking about when the angel of the lord
[1:01:50] came to him that time
[1:01:52] and he said he said well if you will be
[1:01:54] humble
[1:01:55] and sincere he said he said nothing will
[1:01:58] stand before you not even cancer
[1:01:59] he said you but you know what the angel
[1:02:01] lord came back to him and told him he
[1:02:03] said you need to be more sincere
[1:02:07] well you know what he didn't he didn't
[1:02:08] get a birthday angel and say what am i
[1:02:09] supposed to do now
[1:02:12] he said lord let me be more sincere
[1:02:16] lord let me be more sincere lord help me
[1:02:18] to be
[1:02:19] what i need to be that i can be more
[1:02:21] sincere if the angel of the lord is
[1:02:22] telling me this is what i need then lord
[1:02:24] show me what i need to do
[1:02:26] that's what that's what i want to do i
[1:02:27] want to be
[1:02:29] more sincere i want to be more humble
[1:02:32] before you
[1:02:32] that i can do the greater works that i
[1:02:34] can do what you have us to do
[1:02:39] because god wants us to be
[1:02:42] you know to fulfill what we have and
[1:02:44] that should be our desire because that's
[1:02:46] what god's desire
[1:02:47] for you god has a plan and a purpose for
[1:02:50] your life god has a plan and purpose for
[1:02:52] things for you to do
[1:02:54] and you know many times people say well
[1:02:55] you know i i don't know what i'm
[1:02:57] supposed to do
[1:02:59] people worry about you know well
[1:03:03] you know they say well you know if you
[1:03:05] know sometimes people think you know if
[1:03:06] you're not a preacher
[1:03:08] you know if you're if you're not if
[1:03:09] you're not a deacon if you're not a song
[1:03:10] leader if you're not you know
[1:03:12] one of these jobs you know they wonder
[1:03:13] what are you supposed to do
[1:03:16] and you know it's like where am i
[1:03:17] supposed to you know where am i
[1:03:20] what you ought to do is be a light to
[1:03:23] the world
[1:03:26] when brother brahm talking about knowing
[1:03:27] what the fullness of the word is he said
[1:03:29] you know
[1:03:30] it's it's the light to the world when
[1:03:32] you get up and you and you go to your
[1:03:34] work and you and you go to school
[1:03:36] and you live the kind of life before
[1:03:38] people when you realize that you're not
[1:03:39] of the world
[1:03:40] and people realize you know what there's
[1:03:41] a change in this person and you're going
[1:03:43] to school and you're going about
[1:03:45] or if you go to work and you know what
[1:03:46] you're not like everybody else and
[1:03:48] people can look at you and tell there's
[1:03:49] something different about you
[1:03:51] when people say well you know uh is he
[1:03:54] is he a christian well i don't know i
[1:03:55] guess so he goes to church
[1:03:57] but you know it's not that kind of thing
[1:03:59] it's when people get around you and they
[1:04:00] realize you know what there's something
[1:04:01] different about you
[1:04:03] there's something different because they
[1:04:05] know it when they get in your presence
[1:04:06] you know why because if you've been in
[1:04:07] the presence of god then you know what
[1:04:09] when people get in the presence
[1:04:10] of you they ought to be in the presence
[1:04:12] of god too they ought to know there's
[1:04:14] something different about you they're
[1:04:15] standing there like
[1:04:16] you know i you know i feel different
[1:04:18] when i get around him and you know
[1:04:19] there's people you know
[1:04:20] they they get around you and they
[1:04:21] realize you know what i don't want to
[1:04:22] say certain things when i get around
[1:04:23] them you know
[1:04:24] i i catch myself when i why because
[1:04:27] there's something different about you
[1:04:29] but you know if they go along and they
[1:04:31] don't know you you know from
[1:04:33] anybody else and they don't see any
[1:04:35] change they don't see any difference
[1:04:36] then you know
[1:04:37] that's not showing the light to the
[1:04:39] world
[1:04:41] and you know and maybe you know many
[1:04:43] times it's it's not just on the outward
[1:04:45] appearance that
[1:04:46] that people are looking for you know
[1:04:48] that they look and say well you know
[1:04:49] what
[1:04:49] you know you live a certain kind of life
[1:04:51] you dress a certain way well that that's
[1:04:53] good
[1:04:53] if you can dress holiness but you know
[1:04:55] the thing is there's people that get
[1:04:56] around you see
[1:04:57] people that are dressed holiness and
[1:04:59] when you get around them you know what
[1:05:00] they got enough timber to fight above
[1:05:02] saul you know
[1:05:03] they're just just as sours as brother
[1:05:06] ernie always says look like they were
[1:05:07] baptized
[1:05:08] in pickle juice you know they just they
[1:05:09] just so sour whether the bible tells us
[1:05:12] he said the joy of the lord is our
[1:05:13] strength and he said you know he said
[1:05:14] that's one other thing one of the fruits
[1:05:16] of the spirit is to have
[1:05:17] joy you know the thing is even david
[1:05:19] said lord return unto me the joy
[1:05:21] of my salvation you know if you know
[1:05:23] because you know you don't always have
[1:05:25] to look like you look like you've been
[1:05:26] eating green persimmons
[1:05:27] you don't always have to look like you
[1:05:29] know look like you lost your dog
[1:05:31] and all these type things and people
[1:05:32] worry about you know when they go on one
[1:05:34] because you know what if
[1:05:36] he's living on the inside of you if the
[1:05:39] whole
[1:05:39] if the spirit of god is living on the
[1:05:41] inside of you then you know what
[1:05:42] it should change your your atmosphere it
[1:05:44] should change the way you look
[1:05:46] the way the way you speak to people
[1:05:48] everything should be different in your
[1:05:49] life
[1:05:50] it shouldn't be any of the old ways it
[1:05:52] should be you know because people ought
[1:05:53] to see
[1:05:54] jesus christ
[1:05:57] as the old that song years ago
[1:06:00] i always always liked it and it says
[1:06:03] when they looked
[1:06:04] they beheld him when i spoke they could
[1:06:07] hear him
[1:06:09] when i walked my every footstep led them
[1:06:12] all to calvary
[1:06:14] he said let others seek worldly fame
[1:06:17] but when someone speaks his name let
[1:06:19] them
[1:06:20] say they saw him in me
[1:06:25] that's what i that's that's my desire
[1:06:27] can we be humble enough
[1:06:29] to allow him to live that it's no longer
[1:06:31] i
[1:06:32] that live now but it's christ living in
[1:06:34] me i want to be great in the kingdom of
[1:06:37] god
[1:06:38] but you know what it's not that i want
[1:06:40] to be greater than somebody else
[1:06:42] it's not it's not that i'm trying to you
[1:06:44] know i'm trying to get you know i'm
[1:06:45] trying to reach a higher level than
[1:06:47] somebody
[1:06:48] i want to reach the position that god
[1:06:49] has for me that's greatness
[1:06:53] god do what god calls you to do
[1:06:57] and if we can be just what god wants us
[1:06:59] to be you know because the
[1:07:01] as paul said you know he said all the
[1:07:03] body has to fit together
[1:07:07] you know he said there's hearing and and
[1:07:10] they're seeing and and all the different
[1:07:12] parts but you know
[1:07:14] even even the uncomely parts have have
[1:07:16] honor
[1:07:17] you know and even more honor and you
[1:07:19] know all these different parts why
[1:07:20] because it's part of the body
[1:07:22] it's all works together and we all have
[1:07:26] to work together and you know what
[1:07:28] you're not god's not god's not perfect
[1:07:32] he's not complete without you and you
[1:07:34] know what we're not complete without you
[1:07:37] god we all have to work together we all
[1:07:39] have to do our part
[1:07:41] i and you know it's it's a desire that i
[1:07:43] have but i i want
[1:07:44] to to all of us to get to the place
[1:07:47] let's be you know because you know any
[1:07:50] anybody
[1:07:51] that gets up it's just like praying you
[1:07:52] say you can't you can't pray enough well
[1:07:54] you know what you can't be humble enough
[1:07:56] you know as you go along you know you
[1:07:58] say well you know i can always be more
[1:08:00] humble why because the
[1:08:02] we're still fighting the old man we
[1:08:05] still fight him every day
[1:08:07] but i want i want him i want to live the
[1:08:10] way he wants me to live
[1:08:12] amen amen god bless you now let's saw
[1:08:14] stainless let's sing that
[1:08:16] today i want to live
[1:08:20] the way he wants
[1:08:23] me to live i
[1:08:26] want to give until
[1:08:30] there's just no more to give
[1:08:35] i want to love yes

[1:08:42] more love for i could never

[1:09:07] more to give i want to love
